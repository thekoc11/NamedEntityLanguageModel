     3/4  cups          fish broth
                        --chicken or vegetable broth
                        --or water
   6                    dried shiitake mushrooms
   1      whole         red snapper -- gutted
                        --gilled and scaled
                        --about 2-21/2 pounds
   2      tablespoons   peanut oil
     1/3  cup           flour for dredging
   1      large         onion -- sliced
                        salt -- to taste
   1      tablespoon    minced fresh ginger
                        --or 1 teaspoon ground ginger
   2      teaspoons     minced garlic
     1/4  teaspoon      ground red pepper -- (up to 1/2)
                        --cayenne
   2      tablespoons   sherry or white wine
     1/4  cup           rice vinegar -- plus 1 tablespoon
                        --or white-wine vinegar
   1      tablespoon    reduced-sodium soy sauce
   1      teaspoon      sesame oil
   2      tablespoons   minced scallions -- for garnish

1. In a saucepan, heat broth or water until hot. Remove from the heat, add mushrooms and let soak for 15 minutes. Remove the mushrooms from the broth; pull off and discard any tough stems. Slice the caps thinly. Line a strainer with paper towels and set it over a bowl: pour the broth through the strainer to remove any fine grit. Set the mushrooms and broth aside.

2. With kitchen shears, snip the fins off the fish. Check to make sure that the fish will fit in your largest nonstick skillet. If it does not, cut off the head and tail with a large knife. Rinse the fish and blot it dry with paper towels. On each side of the fish, cut 2 or 3 vertical gashes through the flesh down to the center bone.

3, Preheat the skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Add oil; when a pinch of flour sizzles in it, dredge the fish in flour. Shake off the excess and gently place the fish in the pan. Cook until golden brown on the underside, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully turn the fish over and cook until browned on the second side, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Remove the fish to a plate.

4. Return the pan to the stove over medium-high heat. Add onions, sprinkle with salt and cook, stirring, for 2 or 3 minutes. Add ginger, garlic and ground red pepper and cook, stirring, until the onions are soft and brown, about 3 more minutes. Add the reserved mushrooms, then stir in sherry or wine. Add 1/4 cup of the vinegar, soy sauce and the reserved mushroom liquid. Bring to a boil and cook for 1 minute.

5. Reduce the heat to low and return the fish to the pan. Cover and braise for 15 to 20 minutes. Check for doneness by peering into one of the slits; if the meat at the bone is opaque, the fish is done.

6. Transfer the fish to a platter. If the braising liquid is very thin, raise the heat to high and boil until slightly thickened. Stir in sesame oil and the remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar. Spoon the sauce and onions over and around the fish. Sprinkle with scallions. To serve, use a spoon to lift the flesh from the bone.

Using 2 metal spatulas, carefully turn the salmon pieces over and cook just until opaque in the center, 4 to 6 minutes longer. With 2 spatulas, remove salmon from the grill. Slip off the skin.

4. Toss watercress salad with dressing and divide among 4 plates. Top with a piece of grilled salmon. Garnish with lime wedges. Serve immediately.

2. Strain the mussel-cooking liquid through a sieve lined with cheesecloth into a 4-cup measure. Add enough water to measure 3 cups. Sprinkle saffron onto the warm broth and set aside.

3. Rinse the Dutch oven and wipe dry. Add oil and heat over medium heat. Add onions and cook, stirring, until they start to soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, red pepper flakes and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Stir in rice and the remaining 1/2 cup wine and cook, stirring, until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes.

4. Stir in corn and the reserved mussel broth and bring to a simmer. Cover and bake, 25 to 30 minutes, until the rice is tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Stir in the reserved mussel meats and season with salt and pepper. Garnish the top with the reserved mussels in their shells and serve.

Makes about 7 cups, for 4 servings.

                        --cut into twelve 1/4-inch slices
     1/4  cup           finely chopped shallots
   6                    red snapper fillets
                        --about 6 ounces each
                        --skinned and cut in half crosswise
     1/2  cup           imported black olives -- pitted and chopped
   2      tablespoons   drained capers

1. Preheat oven to 450°F. Cut twelve 12-inch squares of aluminum foil or parchment paper. Set a square on the work surface so one corner points toward you. Below the imaginary midline that divides the square into two triangles, place a slice of tomato and a small amount of shallot; top with a piece of fish, a portion of the olives and capers, some salt and pepper, and a pinch of thyme. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon lemon juice and a few drops of oil. Fold the triangle top down over the fish. Seal the packages by firmly folding over the edges three times and place the package in a large baking dish. Repeat with the remaining squares and ingredients.

2. Bake for 15 minutes, rotating the pan in the oven after 10 minutes to ensure even cooking. Carefully open one package; the fish should be opaque in the center. If it is not, reseal the package and bake the fish about 5 minutes longer. Serve 2 packages per person, allowing each diner to open his or her own at the table.

                     Roasted Striped Bass With Fennel

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1                    scaled (6-pound) and cleaned striped bass -- rinsed
                        -- head
                        --gills removed and tail on
                        --3 inches at thickest point
                        --two 3-pound farm-raised striped bass
     1/2  cup           olive oil -- divided
     1/2  cup           fresh lemon juice -- divided
   2      tablespoons   kosher salt -- divided
  10                    grinds black pepper -- (up to 15)
   4      large         fennel bulbs
                        --2 1/2 pounds
                        --with some stalk and fronds remaining

1.With large knife, cut 3 parallel diagonal slashes into each side of the fish, about 1 to 1 1/2 inches into the flesh. Rub 2 tablespoons oil, 2 tablespoons lemon juice and 1 tablespoon salt into sides of the fish, including the slits, and into the internal cavities. Grind some pepper into the cavities.

2. Coat an 18- by 13- by 2-inch roasting pan by rubbing about 1/4 cup of the olive oil all over it with your hands. Place fish in pan on a diagonal. Part of the fish head and/or tail may hang over the corners. Let sit 1 hour.

3. Meanwhile, trim stalks and fronds from fennel. With large knife, coarsely cut up the stalks. Stuff as many pieces of fennel as will fit into the fish head and body cavities. Reserve fronds. Trim a thin slice from the root end of fennel bulbs to clean , but leave bulbs in one piece. With a vegetable peeler, clean dark areas and coarse string from outside of bulbs. Cut the bulbs lengthwise through leaves and stem ends to make wedges, about 8 to 10 per bulb.

4. Preheat oven to 500° F. Make a layer of fennel wedges around fish. Spoon over them the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and all but a few teaspoons of the remaining lemon juice. Sprinkle the fennel with the remaining tablespoon of salt and the pepper. From time to time, tilt roasting pan to collect some of the juices; spoon over fish and fennel.

5. Place oven rack in center of oven. Bake fish for 35 minutes.

6. Using two very large spatulas, remove fish to serving platter. Either surround fish on platter with fennel and pour pan juices and the remaining lemon juice over all, or place fennel and pan juices in a separate serving bowl (which will make it easier to bone the fish) and pour the remaining lemon juice over fish. Coarsely chop reserved fennel Fronds. Sprinkle on fish and fennel platter or, if using separate serving bowl for fennel, divide evenly between fish and fennel.

Note: If using 2 three-pound bass, put them side by side, head to tail, in a roasting pan. Put another rack in the oven under the rack where the fish will go. Put the fennel in a second, medium-size roasting pan and set it on the lower rack in the oven 10 minutes before starting the fish.

Makes 8 servings. Preparation time: About 20 to 25 minutes. Marinating time: About 1 hour. Cooking time: 35 minutes.

   2      medium        red bell peppers
   1                    jalapeno chili
     1/3  cup           lowfat sour cream
     1/2  teaspoon      sugar
   1      pound         sole or other lean fish
          fillets       
   4      cups          bite-size pieces salad greens

Set oven control to broil. Place bell peppers on rack in broiler pan. 
Broil about 5 inches from heat 12 to 16 minutes, turning occasionally, 
until skin is blistered and evenly browned. Place peppers in plastic bag: 
close tightly. Let stand 15 to 20 minutes. Peel peppers; remove stem, 
seeds and membranes.
Hold jalapeno chili over range-top burner, using long-handled fork. Turn 
frequently until skin is blistered and evenly browned. Place chili in 
plastic bag; close tightly. Let stand 15 to 20 minutes. Peel chili; remove 
stem, seeds and membranes.
Place peppers and chili in blender or food processor. Cover and blend or 
process until smooth. Stir in sour cream and sugar.
Set oven control to broil. Cut fish fillets into 4 serving pieces. Place 
on rack in broiler pan. Broil with tops about 4 inches from heat 5 to 6 
minutes or until fish flakes easily with fork (do not turn). Place salad 
greens on 4 serving plates. Top with fish. Serve with sauce. 4 SERVINGS 
(WITH ABOUT 1/4 CUP SAUCE EACH).
NOTE:  Both bell and jalapeno peppers can be roasted under the broiler or 
over a range-top flame. Due to the difference in size, it's not efficient 
to roast them together under the broiler. Brown the jalapenos over a 
burner while the bells broil, then toss them into the plastic bag 
together. Always use care when handling hot chilies; rubber gloves can be 
very helpful.

                    Whole Red Snapper, Simply Roasted

Recipe By     : Eating Well, October 1996
Serving Size  : 4    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Fish                             Main Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      whole         red snapper -- gutted
                        --gilled and scaled
                        --2-2 1/2 pounds
   2      tablespoons   olive oil
                        --preferably extra-virgin
   2      tablespoons   sherry vinegar
                        --or red-wine vinegar
                        --or fresh lemon juice
                        salt & freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
                        lemon quarters -- for garnish
                        chopped fresh parsley -- for garnish

1. Preheat oven to 500°F. To make cleanup easier, line a roasting pan with aluminum foil and set a wire rack in the pan.

2. With kitchen shears, snip the fins off the fish. Rinse the fish and blot it dry with paper towels. On each side of the fish, cut 2 or 3 vertical gashes through the flesh right down to the center bone. Sprinkle the fish (on both sides) with 1 tablespoon of the oil and 1 tablespoon of the vinegar or lemon juice, sprinkle with salt and pepper and rub the fish to make sure the seasonings get into the gashes. Transfer the fish to the prepared pan.

3. Roast, undisturbed, for 20 minutes. Check the fish for doneness by peering into one of the slits; if the meat at the bone is opaque, the fish is done. If not, continue to roast 5 to 10 minutes longer.

4. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar or lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper.

5. Transfer the fish to a platter. Drizzle the oil-vinegar mixture on top and garnish with lemon quarters and parsley. To serve, use a spoon to lift the flesh from the bone.
