     1/3  cup           raisins
   3      Tablespoons   amaretto -- or equal almond flav
   3      cups          Granny Smith apples -- peeled and chopped
     1/3  cup           sugar
   3      Tablespoons   all-purpose flour
     1/4  teaspoon      ground cinnamon
   8      sheets        Phyllo dough -- thawed
   2      cups          vanilla frozen yogurt

Combine raisins and amaretto (or almond flavoring) in a bowl.  Microwave at
High 1 1/2 minutes (be sure to use the equal flavoring for the amaretto not
the same amount); drain.

Combine raisins, apple, sugar, flour, and cinnamon in bowl.  Toss well and
set aside.  Place 1 phyllo sheet on work surface (keep remaining sheets
covered); lightly coat with Pam.  Add remaining sheets on top of each other
one at a time coating each with Pam in between.  Cover with plastic wrap,
press to seal sheets together, throw away plastic.

Spoon apple mixture along 1 long edge of phyllo leaving 2 inches all the way
around.  Fold over the short edge to cover 2-3 inches of filling.  Starting
at the long end, roll up like a jelly roll.  Do not try to roll tightly, the
juices need time to expand.  Place sturdel, seam side down, on a jelly-roll
coated pan sprayed with pam.  Cut small slits in top of the dough.  Bake at
350 for 35 minutes or until golden.  Serve warm with low fat ice cream or
yogurt (included in count).  

Yield: 8 slices.  1 slice with 1/4 cup ice cream is a serving.

     1/2  cup           apple butter
     1/3  cup           pure maple syrup
     1/3  cup           apple cider
     1/3  cup           nonfat plain yogurt
   3      tablespoons   canola oil
                        - Maple glaze:
   1 1/4  cups          confectioner's sugar
   1      teaspoon      pure vanilla extract
     1/4  cup           pure maple syrup -- (1/4 to 1/3)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Coat the molds of a mini-Bundt pan with
nonstick cooking spray or oil. Sprinkle with white sugar, shaking out the
excess.

In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt,
and cinnamon; set aside. In another bowl, whisk together egg, brown sugar,
apple butter, maple syrup, cider, yogurt and oil. Add the dry ingredients
and stir just until moistened. Divide half the batter among the prepared
molds, spooning about 2 generous tablespoonfuls of batter into each mold.

Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the tops spring back when touched
lightly. Loosen the edges and turn the cakes out onto a wire rack to cool.
Clean the mini-Bundt pan, then recoat it with cooking spray or oil and
sugar. Repeat with the remaining batter. To make maple glaze:

In a bowl, combine confectioners' sugar and vanilla. Gradually whisk in
enough maple syrup to make a coating consistency. Dip the fluted side of the
"doughnuts" in the glaze to coat. Then set them glazed side up on a wire
rack over waxed paper for a few minutes until the glaze has set.

Makes about 24 muffins.

*I spray the muffin papers with pam or use a non-stick muffin pan but I 
still spray it with pam.  They are so low fat that they stick to the paper 
and the pan.
**They should be kept refrigerated or frozen. (no preservatives)
*** Freezes well
NOTES: These are great muffins that are 2 points for 2 ( or 4 muffins 
for 3 points:) because they are so high in fiber.

NOTES : JENN'S LOWER FAT NOTES: The origional called for Oleo.  I found out that Oleo is the name of one of the earliest brands of margarine.  The origional called for reg cream of mushroon and cream of chicken soup, called for reg sharp cheese, and reg cubed beef and pork.  I changed all these to lower fat versions.

JENN'S NOTES: I'd probably add some broccoli or cauliflower or other veggies to this :)

               Baked Tomatoes Stuffed with Orzo  (5 points)

   5 1/3  oz            orzo
   4      lg            tomatoes -- firm, ripe
                        sugar
     2/3  tsp           salt
                        black pepper
     1/3  tsp           dried oregano -- rubbed
     1/3  c             mozzarella cheese, part skim milk -- cubed
   2 2/3  tbsp          reduced-calorie margarine
     2/3  med           onion -- finely chopped
   1 1/3  pt            lowfat chicken broth
   2 2/3  tbsp          parmesan cheese -- freshly grated

Remove the center pulp and seeds from the tomatoes, hollowing them out
well. Lightly sprinkle into each tomato a little sugar, salt, pepper and
oregano; place four cubes of mozzarella in each tomato.

Preheat oven to 400-degrees.

Melt the butter in a saucepan and saute the onion in it until soft; stir
in the orzo, stirring well so each grain of pasta is coated. Pour in 2
cups of the chicken broth, stir well, and simmer until it is absorbed,
adding more broth gradually until the orzo is about three quarters cooked;
firmer than al dente (I cooked mine longer--don't like pasta that firm).
Taste it as you go and cook until it's as firm as you like. Blend in the
Parmesan, stirring it in well.

Spoon the orzo mixture into the hollowed tomatoes, filling them. Place the
filled tomatoes in a casserole or baking dish with 1/2 cup of hot broth in
the bottom of the dish.

Bake, covered, for 15 minutes; remove the cover and cook an additional 10
minutes.

This rich-tasting baklava contains half the amount of sugar and a fraction
of the fat you would normally use, thanks to reduced fats, sugar, and
nuts. The   results will fool anyone.

1. Combine pistacho nuts, sugar, cinnamon and rose water in small bowl.
Using half of filo sheets (cover remaining with plastic wrap to prevent
from drying out), place 3 sheets in bottom of lightly greased 13x9" baking
sheet. Brush with some of margarine. Sprinkle evenly with nut mixture.
Place remaining sheets over nut filling, brushing after every third sheet
and top sheet.
 2. Cut baklava at 1-1/2" intervals diagonally to form pattern of about 5
diamond shapes. Bake at 400'F. 25 minutes or until golden. Place on wire
rack to cool. Drizzle Rose Water Syrup evenly over top and allow to soak
several hours.

Stud each diamond-shape with whole clove.

NOTES : This is a my favorite  low-point banana bread with lots of fiber. But be forewarned, my kids (who only like their bread
white) are not wild about it (but that leaves more for hubby and me).

I also make this into a dozen banana bran muffins which I find easier for portion control.
Use a muffin tin that has been sprayed with Pam and bake for about 15 minutes at 375°F. Use a toothpick to test for doneness.
I try to keep a batch of these in my freezer door for a quick breakfast on the run.  I put each muffin in a cheap sandwich bag and
then place them all in a gallon-size freezer ziploc.

NOTES : It's important to make sure eggs are safe, which means bringing them 
to a temperature of at least 160º.  Be sure to do this slowly over heat no 
higher than medium so you don't curdle the yolks.  Using your heaviest 
saucepan will control and disperse the heat much better than a thinner pan.  
The dry milk gives this ice cream a smooth consistency and adds calcium, too.

   1      4 x 6         inch (15 cm) corn tortillas
  15 1/2  oz            pinto or black beans -- rinsed and drained
   1      cup           salsa (fresh)
   8      oz            fresh salsa
   8      oz            low sodium canned corn -- drained
     3/4  cup           reduced-fat sharp cheddar cheese -- shredded
   1      cup           romaine lettuce -- shredded
     1/2                avocado -- diced
     1/2  cup           fat-free sour cream
   2                    scallions -- thinly sliced
   2      tablespoons   cilantro -- chopped

1. Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C).

2. Arrange tortillas in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake until
crisp and light brown around edges, 5 to 7 minutes.

3. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, mix beans and 1/2 cup salsa. Cook,
stirring as needed and mashing beans, until heated through, about 5 minutes.

4. In a small bowl, mix remaining 1/2 cup of salsa and corn.

5. Place tortillas on plates. Spread each with bean mixture, then top with
cheese, lettuce, corn mixture, avocado, sour cream, scallions and cilantro.

To easily dice an avocado: Cut it in half lengthwise by running a knife
through the center, around the pit. Twist the halves to release one half
from the pit. Place that half flat-side down on a cutting board and peel off
the skin. Cut the avocado into bite-size cubes.

Original recipe called for 1 lb. steak, which would have brought it under
30% CFF, but we like more meat in it. Russell Fletcher webauthor@bigfoot.com

Betsy's Notes: Made 2/14/00. Had 1 1/2 lbs of extra lean stew beef in cubes
and used it just as it was (original recipe called for 1 lb of t-bone steak,
and then sliced it thin). To make up for the extra beef I increased the
broth to use the whole can (was 1 cup), and the flour (was 1/3 cup). And,
because the extra beef gave me additional servings, I increased the noodle
amount to give me the right nutritional analysis.

 Warm the pita, if necessary, so that the pockets will open easily.

Add  celery, bell pepper, and  thyme and saute until tender.

Remove from heat.  Set oven to 350ºF.

      [----- The dish may be made ahead to this point -----]

Fill each pita pocket with bean filling; about 1 cup will be left out.

Arrange in an open pan.  Tent with foil, optional. The pockets will be taco-crisp if you do not.

Bake 350ºF for 15-20 mins.

Make a stew with remaining bean filling by adding broth, finely diced mixed vegetables (from crudite mix) and chutney. Heat slowly and thoroughly.

   1      envelope      dry yeast
   1      teaspoon      sugar
     1/4  cup           warm water -- (105 - 115 F)
     1/2  ounce         unsweetened chocolate
   1      tablespoon    margarine
   1 1/4  cups          water
     1/4  cup           dark molasses
   2      tablespoons   apple cider vinegar
   1      tablespoon    salt
     1/2  cup           All-Bran® Cereal
   2      cups          all-purpose flour -- (2 to 2 3/4)
   1 1/2  cups          rye flour
                        


Sprinkle yeast and sugar over 1/4 cup water; stir to dissolve. Let stand 
until foamy, about 10 minutes.

Melt chocolate and margarine with 1-1/4 cups water in large bowl set over 
gently simmering water. Stir until smooth. Remove from over water. Blend in 
molasses, vinegar and salt. Mix in cereal. Let cool.

Grease large bowl. Blend yeast into cereal mixture. Gradually stir in 2 cups 
all-purpose flour and rye flour. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface 
and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes, kneading in up to 3/4 
cup more all-purpose flour if necessary to form workable dough. Add dough to 
prepared bowl, turning to coat entire surface. Cover and let rise in warm 
draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.

Grease two 3 x 2 x 7-inch loaf pans. Punch dough down. Turn out onto lightly 
floured surface and let rest 3 minutes. Knead 3 minutes. Divide dough in 
half. Roll each into 7 x 8-inch rectangle. Starting with long side, roll 
dough up into cylinder. Tuck ends under and pinch seam to seal. Place seam 
side down in prepared pans. Cover and let rise in warm draft-free area until 
doubled, about 1-1/2 hours.

Preheat oven to 375°F.  Bake until loaves sound hollow when tapped on bottom, 
about 45 minutes. Remove bread from pans. Let cool completely on rack before 
serving.

   2      large         red onions -- about. 1 1/2 lbs
     1/2  cup           bread crumbs -- or Panko
   1      teaspoon      garlic powder
     1/2  teaspoon      paprika
   2      large         egg whites

Preheat the oven to 375* F.  Lightly spray a baking sheet with olive oil 
spray.

Peel the skin from the onions and trim the bottoms so that the onions sit 
flat. Starting at the center of the top of each onion and working around 
it, cut 20 to 30 slits, cutting only three-quarters into the onion for a 
"flower" effect. Transfer to the baking sheet. 

In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs, garlic powder and paprika. Set 
aside. In another bowl, whisk the egg whites lightly with a fork. Pour the

whites over the onion to cover thoroughly and then sprinkle evenly with 
the seasoned crumbs. Spray lightly with olive oil spray and bake for 40 to

50 minutes, until the onions are lightly browned. Serve Immediately.

latter if you prefer.  You can also use dried figs in place of the fresh.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      cups          sliced onions -- halved
   2      teaspoons     concentrated beef base*
     1/4  teaspoon      pepper
   2      cans          diced tomatoes -- undrained -- (14.5 oz)
     1/2  cup           water
   1 1/2  pounds        beef top round steak(1/2 inch thick) -- trimmed of fat, cut
                        --in 1" serving size pieces

*One-half cup of condensed beef broth can be used in place of the
concentrated beef base plus the water in this recipe. ( I used 1 cup
Swanson's beef broth, and it worked well.)

1. In Dutch oven or 12-inch skillet, combine all ingredients except beef;
mix well. Place beef over tomato mixture. Bring to a boil. 2. Stir gently.
Reduce heat; cover and simmer 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until beef is tender.

Total Carbs, 2g Fiber, 5g Sugars, 26g Pro.

Dietary Exchanges: 2 Veg, 3 very lean meat, 1/2 Fat.

Ingredient Info: Beef top round steak is a less tender cut of meat. Braising
(cooking in a small amount of liquid) helps to tenderize the meat.

Serving Suggestion: Creamy Garlic Mashed Potatoes and steamed broccoli are
delicious accompaniments for this saucy steak.

   1      cup           Egg Beaters® 99% egg substitute -- equiv to 8 eggs
   4                    eggs
   2      tablespoons   water
                        salt and pepper -- to taste
   6 3/8  ounces        Healthy Choice Lowfat Breakfast Sausage -- 8 patties- 1 package
     1/2                onion -- chopped
     1/2                green pepper -- chopped
  10                    98% Fatfree Flour Tortillas -- 1 bag/Mission brand
     1/2  cup           shredded lowfat cheese -- *Sargento light
   1      Tablespoon    butter -- or margarine
                        cooking spray

Sauté onion and pepper in non-stick pan which has been sprayed
with desired flavor of non-stick spray. Add cut up Healthy Choice
sausage and stir into vegetable mixture. (No need to cook sausage;
 it's fully pre-cooked.)

Transfer to a bowl or bag and refrigerate.

Lightly beat eggs and egg substitute with the water. Melt butter or
margarine in the skillet that was used to sauté the onions and peppers
(or use non-stick spray). When melted, stir in egg mixture.

Cook eggs until almost done, keeping in fairly large curds. Salt and 
pepper to taste.

Combine eggs and cooled sausage mixture.

Warm tortillas in the microwave. Place about 1/4 cup of the egg mixture
in the center of a tortilla.

Top with 1 scant tablespoon of shredded cheddar cheese.

Roll tortilla and wrap in waxed paper, tape to seal (label if making more
than one kind).

Place waxed paper wrapped tortillas in a zip-lock freezer bag in
the freezer.

To heat from freezer:

Cook a single wrapped burrito in the microwave for about 2 minutes
 on 50% power (or' defrost') (would take longer if you were doing
multiples). Then microwave for about 1/2 minute more on full power 
or until hot. Just peel the paper down as you eat so that all the
filling stays in.

NOTES : I got the original recipe for these from Libby. I've been
 experimenting with lowering the fat and calorie content without
"ruining" the flavor and texture. This is my final "successful" experiment!
I chose to use a small amount of real butter and real eggs, but these 
could easily by made with all egg substitute and cooking
spray. This would change the nutritional analysis to:

   2      tablespoons   melted butter
   2 1/2  cups          blueberries
   1      tablespoon    grated orange peel
   2 1/2  teaspoons     butter

Stir flour, brown sugar and baking powder in a medium-size bowl. Measure 
buttermilk in a 4-cup glass measure. Add egg and melted butter. Beat until 
blended. Add to flour mixture and stir gently until well blended. Stir in 
blueberries and orange peel. Heat nonstick griddle over medium heat until 
hot. Lightly grease griddle with about 1/2 teaspoon of the remaining butter 
per batch of pancakes. For each pancake, pour a scant 1/4 cup batter on 
griddle. Cook 3 to 4 minutes until bubbles appear on surface and undersides 
are golden brown. Turn pancakes over and cook 2 to 3 minutes longer. Remove 
to a plater and sprinkle with brown sugar.

Place the onions, butter and broth in a crock pot and cook on low 12-24
hours until the onions are deep golden brown and very soft. Different crock
pots will take different amounts of time. It is almost impossible to
overcook this, so go for the deepest brown. Use the onions and liquid to
flavor soup, stock, and stews. they make a wonderful addition to risotto, a
perfect pasta sauce, and the world's best pizza topping (drain off the
liquid first).

   1      pound         chicken breasts without skin

   1      teaspoon      peppercorns
     1/2  cup           cider vinegar

     1/4  cup           brown sugar
   1      large         Spanish onions -- chopped
     1/4  cup           scallions -- chopped
                        -  (white and green parts)
   1      tablespoon    jalapeno pepper -- chopped
     1/2  teaspoon      ground allspice
     1/2  teaspoon      ground nutmeg
   1      teaspoon      thyme
     1/4  teaspoon      white pepper
     1/4  cup           lime juice

Prepare marinade:

Crush whole cloves and peppercorns in a spice grinder or coffee grinder.
(Blender might work, too). Combine with all other ingredients, except
chicken in a blender or food processor. Blend until the marinade is thick
and smooth, with no chunks in it.

Place the chicken in a non-metal container. A glass bowl is good; so are
ziplock bags. Pour the marinade over the chicken. (Instead of individual
breasts, I used skinless chicken tenders, which I buy frozen by the large
bagful at a warehouse store). Marinate, refrigerated, for 8 hours or
overnight.

Remove the chicken from the marinade. Discard the marinade. Cook the

chicken on a grill 6 minutes on each side, or until there is no trace of
pink inside. Or, cook in a lightly-oiled cast iron pan over high heat. (You
could broil it in the oven, too.)

Slice into strips before serving, if you wish.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2  cup           Lemon Juice
     1/4  cup           chili sauce
   2      tablespoons   Dijon mustard
   1      tablespoon    dried basil
   1      tablespoon    minced fresh parsley
   2      pounds        Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast
                        Aluminum Foil

Combine liquid ingredients, basil and parsley in shallow baking dish to create marinade. Mix well. If using Fresh Chicken, rinse well with cold water and pat dry with paper towels. If using frozen poultry, rinse well with water to remove ice glaze and pat dry with paper towels. Place chicken in marinade. Cover dish with foil. Marinate in refrigerator for 2 hours. Drain chicken and discard marinade. Grill or broil chicken as desired until fully cooked. Refrigerate leftover chicken in fresh sheet of foil. 

Grill chicken until tender and the juices run clear. Try grilling chicken using the indirect method: make a drip pan from Heavy Duty aluminum foil; surround foil drip pan with coals and place chicken on rack directly above the drip pan; chicken will cook more slowly, but will be less likely to burn or become charred. To keep chicken from sticking, spray grill with non-stick cooking spray, or rub with vegetable oil prior to grilling.

   1      cup           chili sauce (Heinz brand)
     1/4  cup           prepared horseradish -- well drained (you
                        might want to start out
                        adding just a touch of this - it can get
                        rather hot and it's easier to add
                        more then to take any away - taste as you
                        go along and stop adding when it
                        suites your palate.)
     1/4  cup           granulated sugar
   2      tablespoons   distilled vinegar
   2      teaspoons     minced sweet onion
   2      teaspoons     Worcestershire sauce
   2      teaspoons     celery seed
   1      teaspoon      celery salt
     1/2  teaspoon      garlic powder
     1/4  teaspoon      fresh ground black pepper
     1/4  teaspoon      hot pepper sauce

In a medium, glass or stainless steel bowl whisk together all the
ingredients until completely combined and the sugar dissolves. Cover and
refrigerate for at least one day to give the flavors time to blend. (Two
days is even better.) 

Makes 8 servings

Good cocktail sauce is a MUST for shrimp - it almost MAKES the meal and
boiled shrimp without a good sauce is like a dance with no music! This is
one of my favorite sauces - I keep everything on hand to make this so that
I'm not caught 'dancing with no music!' *lol*

NOTES : Rolled dumplings are a traditional favorite of African Americans.
This round drop version is easy to prepare and has a slightly
different texture, but with the addition of pepper, they keep their
spunk! 

To keep Bisquick baking mix fresh longer, refrigerate after opening.

Pureeing ingredients in a blender may seem odd, but you'll be pleased with the result. Instead of folding chunks of cooked
chicken into cooked spaghetti, arrange the sliced chicken atop the casserole, add a little more sauce, and top it with breadcrumbs
and cheese. Then pop the dish into the oven long enough to brown the top.

NOTES : Here is a wonderful pie - one of my all-time favorite recipes!! 
If its hot where you are - try it!! *Hint: I have trouble
with clumping in my pies. I have solved that problem by using 
lukewarm water and dissolving the dry milk powder in the water. Then I
let it sit a few minutes while I measure out other ingredients to get them
 ready to put in the recipe. Then I mix the wet mixture in with the pudding.
 It is so cooling and refreshing and creamy and CHOCOLATEY
"I freeze this pie (individual slices). When I want it, I set it out about 15-30
 minutes ahead of time. Let it thaw enough to eat
it. WOWSERS!!! Is it good!!! I reminds me of mint chocolate-chip ice 
cream and York Peppermint Patties. (I didn't tell my daughter
that this pie is "healthy" - I just told her that its a mint chocolate chip pie
 - she loves it). "

     1/4  cup           shredded coconut -- toasted,* if
                        desired
   2      ounces        white baking bars (from 6-ounce package) -- melted
                        **CHOCOLATE PIZZA SAUCE**
   6      ounces        semisweet chocolate chips (1 cup)
   2      tablespoons   butter or margarine
   3      tablespoons   milk
   1      cup           powdered sugar

1.  Heat oven to 350°. Mix margarine, sugars, vanilla and egg in large bowl. Stir in flour and baking soda (dough will be stiff). 
     
2.  Pat dough in ungreased 12-inch pizza pan or into 12-inch circle on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake about 15 minutes or until golden brown. Cool about 30 minutes. 
  
3.  Make Chocolate Pizza Sauce; spread over baked layer. Immediately sprinkle with pecans, candies and coconut; press lightly. Drizzle with melted baking bars. Let stand until set. Remove from pan if desired. Cut into wedges. 

For Sauce:
Heat chocolate chips, margarine and milk over low heat, stirring occasionally, just until chocolate is melted; remove from heat. Stir in powdered sugar. Beat with wire whisk until smooth, glossy and spreadable. (If not glossy, stir in a few drops hot water.)  

*To toast coconut, bake uncovered in ungreased shallow pan in 350° oven 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden brown. Or cook in ungreased heavy skillet over medium-low heat 6 to 14 minutes, stirring frequently until browning begins, then stirring constantly until golden brown. 

Betty's Shortcuts:
  a.. Mix 1 package (1 pound 3.8 ounces) Betty Crocker® fudge brownie mix as directed on the package; spread batter in greased pizza pan. Bake at 350° about 30 minutes or until center is set; cool. Spread with 1 tub Betty Crocker Soft Whipped chocolate ready-to-spread frosting instead of the Chocolate Pizza Sauce. 
  b.. Freeze the unfrosted cookie tightly covered up to 2 months. Thaw before frosting and decorating.

     1/4  teaspoon      cream of tartar
     1/8  teaspoon      salt

   1      large         egg
     1/3  cup           light corn syrup
   2      teaspoons     light corn syrup -- combine two corn syr
     1/2  cup           unsweetened cocoa powder
   2      ounces        semisweet chocolate -- finely chopped
   2      ounces        Neufchatel cheese -- softened
   2      teaspoons     unflavored gelatin
   1      teaspoon      vanilla extract
     1/2  teaspoon      peppermint extract
     1/2  cup           sugar
   2      large         egg whites -- room temperature
                        **Garnish**
   1      ounce         semisweet chocolate

TO MAKE CRUST: Preheat oven to 275 degrees F.  Lightly oil a 9-inch pie
plate and set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, combine egg whites, cream of tartar and salt.
Beat with an electric mixer until soft peaks form.  Add 1/4 cup sugar
and beat for 30 seconds.  Gradually beat in the remaining 1/2 cup sugar.
Add vanilla and beat for 7 to 10 minutes longer, stopping occasionally to
scrape down the sides of the bowl, until all the sugar is dissolved and
the meringue is stiff and shiny.

Spread the meringue over the bottom and sides of the prepared pie
plate.  Using the back of a spoon, spread some meringue up to the rim, forming
a decorative edge.  Alternatively, using a piping bag fitted with a start
tip, pipe the meringue into the pie plate.  Bake for about 1 hour and
15 minutes, or until firm and crisp.  Cool on a wire rack.  (The meringue
crust can be prepared ahead and stored, covered, in an airtight
container for up to 1 week.)

TO MAKE FILLING:  In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup
milk, 1 whole egg, 1/3 cup corn syrup and cocoa until smooth.  In a
heavy 2 quart saucepan, heat the remaining 3/4 cup milk until bubbles appear
at the edge; remove from heat.  Whisk a little hot milk into the cocoa
mixture.  Then whisk the cocoa mixture into the remaining milk in the
saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden
spoon, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until slightly thickened.  Remove from heat and
whisk in chocolate and cream cheese until smooth.  Set aside.

In a small saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over 1/4 cup water.  let soften
for about 3 minutes.  heat over low heat for 1 to 3 minutes, or until the
gelatin is dissolved.  whisk into the chocolate mixture along with
vanilla and peppermint.  Set aside.

In a small saucepan, combine 1/4 cup water, 1/2 cup sugar and 2 tsp.
corn syrup.  Bring to a boil and cook, without stirring, over medium-high
heat for about 5 minutes, or until the syrup registers 230 degrees F on a
candy thermometer and is at thread stage (when a bit of syrup dipped in cold
water forms a fine thread).  At this point, in a medium-sized mixing
bowl, begin beating egg whites with an electric mixer at medium low speed.
Beat until soft peaks form.  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar and beat
at medium high speed until egg whites are stiff but not dry.

When the sugar syrup registers 239 degrees F and is at soft-ball stage
(when a bit of syrup dipped in cold water forms a soft, pliable ball),
gradually pour it over the beaten egg whites, beating constantly at
medium-high speed.  Beat at medium speed for about 5 minutes longer, or
until the egg whites are stiff, satiny and cool.

Whisk about 1 cup of this meringue into the chocolate mixture.  fold in
the remaining meringue.  turn into the prepared meringue crust,
spreading to the edges.  Smooth top.  Cover loosely with plastic and refrigerate
until the filling is set, for at least 3 hours or for up to 8 hours.

TO GARNISH PIE: If desired, warm chocolate in a microwave oven at
medium low (30 percent) power for 1 to 2 minutes, or just until slightly
softened but not melted.  Alternatively, warm it in a 250 degree F oven for 3 to
5 minutes  using a vegetable peeler, shave off curls onto a sheet of wax
paper.  Arrange the curls decoratively over the top of the pie.

NOTES :  Diverse wild plums sweetened, spiced and extended the foods of so
many tribes. These festive and delicious fruit-nut bars are served at many
gatherings, and as winter desserts, they remind us of the ripe, hot days of
July and August in the plum thickets.

   1      quart         fat-free chicken broth
   2 3/4  cups          frozen super-sweet corn kernels
   3      cups          diced potatoes
     1/2                bay leaf
   1      can           evaporated skim milk -- (1 ounce) (1 to 12)

     1/2  teaspoon      Tabasco hot sauce
     1/2  teaspoon      Worcestershire sauce

Add the bacon grease (use butter if you don't have or want to use bacon
grease) to a 5-quart saucepan and place over medium heat. When the grease
is hot, add the onions, celery, peppers, and cook, stirring occasionally,
for 7 to 8 minutes, or until soft. Add the flour and cook for 4 minutes,
stirring. Using a wire whisk, whisk in the chicken broth and whip out any
lumps until smooth. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes. While
the soup is simmering, puree half the corn in a food processor. Add the
pureed corn, remaining corn kernels, potatoes, and bay leaf to the saucepan
and simmer until the potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally, about 15
minutes. Whisk in the evaporated skim milk, sour cream, and seasonings.
Remove the bay leaf. Cook until hot; do not boil. Serve immediately dusted
with the chopped parsley.

I enjoy thick and hearty soups, in fact that is the one thing I _really_
miss during the summer because here in West Texas it's just TOO hot to have
a bowl of soup between May and October! *lol* Sometimes, early in May, if
it rains and is chilly I will scurry and put a pot of some sort of soup on
- knowing that it will most likely be the last time until the next cold
spell hits - months away... This is one of the 'standards' I use for such
an occasion... My three favorites are Potato Soup, Split Pea Soup and this
bone warming Corn Chowder. *sigh* Come on 70's, I want soup again!

We kept the creamy texture of this lightened classic by using low-fat
sour cream and fat-free cream cheese instead of butter and heavy cream.
 Serve this rich appetizer with a French bread baguette, coarse-grained
mustard, and gherkins.

1.  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

2.  Melt butter in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add
onion and garlic, and saute 4 minutes.  Add chicken livers; cook 2
minutes or until livers lose their pink color.  Add port, and cook 3
minutes or until most of liquid evaporates.  Cool.

3.  Place chicken liver mixture, salt, and next 5 ingredients (salt
through allspice) in a food processor or blender;  process until
smooth, scraping sides of bowl occasionally.  Add the sour cream,
chicken breast, and cream cheese;  process until smooth, scraping sides
of bowl occasionally.  Spread chicken mixture into an 8 x 4-inch pan
coated with cooking spray.  Bake at 325 degrees for 1 hour or until a
thermometer registers 170 degrees.  Cool;  cover and chill 8 hours. 
Serve at room temperature.

NOTES : "My kids hated cabbage," recalls Lee Silvey of Snohomish, Washington. 
"But when times were hard, I wanted to make the most of this economical 
vegetable, so I invented this creamy combination," she explains. "They 
gobbled it up. Now it's a must at our holiday dinners."

NOTES : Once the soup is processed, the addition of extra yogurt adds a creamy texture.  The diced cucumber and radishes add a crunchy texture.  If hothouse cucumbers are not available, substitute the firm garden variety and double the amount called for.  Peel cucumbers and halve lengthwise, then seed.

the crockpot, then put the steak in a single layer on top of the vegetables.
Pour the rest of the ingreds. over the top. Cover and cook on low 8-10 hours

it was so salty. Then when it was almost done I thickened it with a little
flour.

hour, skimming the surface as necessary.Remove and reserve the stewing hen

neat little pieces. Strain the saffron broth through a fine sieve.

(Note: The soup can be made through this step in advance. Simply
refrigerate broth and diced chicken meat for 2 to 3 days, or freeze the
broth and the chicken meat in separate convenient sized containers. Be sure
to label and date them. To use, defrost, remove congealed fat, return the
broth full boil, and add the diced meat. Continue with recipe.) Add the
corn, celery, parsley, and cooked noodles to the broth. Return the soup to a
simmer and serve immediately.

  spray. Dust the pan with flour, shaking out excess.
  In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour,
  granulated sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking

  comes out clean. Cool the cake for 10 minutes. Remove
  from pan and let cool completely on rack. ICING: In a
  small bowl, whisk together confectioner's sugar,
  vanilla and enough of the buttermilk to make a thick
  but pourable icing. Set the cake on a serving platter
  and drizzle the icing over the top.

  80                    grape leaves
   1      Lb            Ground Round
   1 1/3  Cups          White Rice -- Uncooked Conven
   1      Bunch         Dill
   3      Small         Onion
   2      Medium        egg whites
   1      Medium        Egg
   1      Tablespoon    Olive Oil
                        salt and pepper -- to taste
   4                    Lemons -- 1/2 For Sauce
   1                    Leek
   1      Bunch         Parsely
   6      Cloves        garlic
  10                    green onion, whole -- Chopped
   1      Cup           Hot Water -- May Need Adjusting

Heat the1 table of  oil in a skillet.  Add the onions and leek  and saute
  for about 5 minutest.  Add the garlic and cook for a few minutes, then add 
the rice, dill, parsley1/2 , lemon juice, salt,  pepper.  Stir well, then 
add the hotwater.  Cover and simmer about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat 
and cool.

Next  carefully remove the grapevine leaves from the jar, leaving the
  brine in the jar.  Wash grapevine leaves thoroughly and drain
.  (If using fresh
  grapevine leaves use the same procedure, parboiling leaves for 5 minutes
  when not tender, then drain.)
Line an enameled pan with a few heavy
  grapevine leaves and set aside.  To stuff a grapevine leaf, put it on your
  working surface rough side up and stem end near you, and place a
  teaspoonful of the rice mixture near the stem end.  Using both hands, fold
  the part of the leaf near you up and over the filling.  Then fold the
  right side of the leaf over the filling, then the left side, and roll
  tightly and back away from you and toward the pointed end of leaf.  Place
  the  seam side down, in the prepared pan.  Continue stuffing
  grapevine leaves until the mixture has been used.  (If any grapevine
  leaves remain, replace in the reserved brine for future use.)  Place an
  inverted plate on the dolmades, then add enough water to cover the
  dolmades   Bring to a boil, then cover the pan,
  lower the heat, and simmer as slowly as possible for 1-1/4 hours, then
  taste one to see if the rice is tender, and continue cooking slowly if
  necessary.  Cool, then chill.  Serve cold, as an appetizer or as an
  entree.

Egg lemon sauce
Take  2 egg whites , beat till foamy. Then add 1yolk , juice from 1-2 
squeezed lemons. Take 1/2 cup of left over water from cooking and add, MUST 
BE COOLED
.Cook on low to medium heat untill just thick. pour over domades, carefuly 
not to open up!

freeze individually in freezer on cookie sheet or foil the n when flash 
frozen stick in baggies and remove when needed!

NOTES : these taste just as yummy without sauce and with a bit of olive oil 
and lemon sprinkled or sprayed with mister on top!point s will be the same.
if there is any left over "filling" it can be put into a pie crust and used
as a pot pie type filling! my self though i would add soem water and tomato
paste and cook the rice for at least 20 minutes before putting in pie crust!

You can also "flash freeze" these on a cookie pan in freezer and when just 
about frozen pop in freezer bags!

ok i adjusted it a bit combineing the best of both ...not very traditional 
but for thos e watching points it ROCKS!

            Double-Stuffed Potatoes or Mashed (5 lbs 4-5 PTS)

Recipe By     : JaneStarr@home.com
Serving Size  : 10   Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   5      pounds        Idaho potatoes -- 10 medium
   4      tablespoons   butter
     3/4  cup           skim milk -- to 1/2 c warmed
   4      tablespoons   parmesan cheese -- grated
     1/2  cup           nonfat cottage cheese -- I use high calcium
                        kind
     1/2  cup           nonfat sour cream
                        salt and white pepper -- to taste

1a).  For Mashed Potatoes:
Peel potatoes and cut into chunks (about 2 inches square). Boil in salted 
water for about 20 minutes -- until tender. Drain potatoes
and place back in pot.  Proceed as below:

1b). For Baked Double-stuffed :
Wash potatoes well and prick with a fork. Bake for about 1 hour at 425 
degrees (until done).
Cut potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop out insides. Put potato pulp into a 
large bowl and proceed per below directions:

2). Mash potatoes with butter, then stir in milk and cheeses. (If serving "fussy
 eaters", you may want to puree cottage cheese before adding -- I don't
 usually do this, but it made for a smoother texture the one time that I tried it)
Stir in sour cream and desired seasonings. (I often use seasoned salt and a
 pinch  of cajun seasoning.)

3a). Serve immediately as mashed potatoes or...

3b). Place in a 8" square casserole dish that has been sprayed with cooking
 oil spray. Sprinkle with paprika and bake uncovered at 350 degrees for
 about 30  minutes for potato casserole or... 

3c). Fill each potato skin, place on baking sheet, sprinkle with Paprika and
 bake for approximately 20-30 mins at 350 to 425 degrees (depending on
 what else you have cooking in the oven).

I don't really care for the flavor or texture of potatoes that have been 
frozen and thawed, but I'm picky...  so, I have yet to try freezing these;
 but I imagine that the casserole and the skins would both freeze well. 
(I might consider leaving out the sour cream if freezing.)

I'm not sure how long they would take to reheat from the frozen state.  I 
would try 350 degrees and check on the double-stuffs after 35 mins and
 the casserole after 45 mins.

These double-stuffed potatoes keep well for at least a week in the fridge
 (as long as you use fresh milk).  I reheat in a 350 degree toaster oven
 for about 12 minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      pounds        butternut squash
   3      cups          nonfat low-salt chicken broth
                        salt and pepper
   3      medium        leeks -- dice
                        - white part and one inch green
   1 1/2  tablespoons   extra virgin olive oil
   1 1/2  cups          arborio rice
   3                    garlic cloves -- minced
   2      tablespoons   fresh flatleaf parsley -- chopped
   1      teaspoon      fresh thyme -- chopped
     1/2  teaspoon      fresh rosemary -- chopped
     1/2  teaspoon      fresh sage -- chopped
     1/8  teaspoon      nutmeg -- freshly grated
   1      teaspoon      orange zest -- grated
     1/2                orange -- juiced
                        - options:
   3      tablespoons   pecans -- toasted and chopped
     1/2  cup           freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano

Cut squash in half lengthwise, then scoop out and discard seeds. Peel and
cut into 1/2- inch chunks.

In a medium-size saucepan over high heat, bring broth and 3 cups water to a
simmer. Add squash and simmer until almost tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove
squash and season with salt and pepper, and set aside. Reserve broth
separately. 

Place leeks and tips cup water in a large frying pan. Cover and simmer until
leeks are soft, about 12 minutes, adding more water if it evaporates.
Reserve leeks, and add cooking liquid to reserved broth.

Warm broth over low heat on a back burner. Warm olive oil in a large skillet
over medium heat. Add rice and cook, stirring constantly, 2 to 3 minutes.
With a ladle, add about 3/4 cup broth and stir to free rice from bottom and
sides of pan.

When rice has absorbed first addition of broth, add another ladleful of
stock. Stir often to keep rice from sticking, adding more stock a ladleful
at a time to keep grains moist. After 10 minutes of adding broth and
stirring, add leeks, garlic. and next 7 ingredients (through juice) and
continue to stir. Continue to add broth until the rice is render with no
chalky centers (but still firm), 18 to 22 minutes. If you run out of broth,
add hot water. When rice is just tender, add an additional ladle of broth or
water and reserved squash. Remove pan from heat, cover, and let sit 5
minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

To serve, place the risotto in a bowl and garnish with pecans and cheese.

   1      cup           diced onion -- 1/2 bag frozen is
                        OK
   1      46 oz can     V-8® vegetable juice -- or tomato juice
   3      teaspoons     instant beef broth granules or
   3      packets       instant beef broth & seasoning mix or
   6      teaspoons     beef bouillon concentrate -- Bovril
   3      cups          water
   8      cloves        minced garlic -- (equal to 4 tsp. in
                        jar)
  10      cups          assorted sliced veggies -- *see Note
   4      teaspoons     fresh parsley -- chopped (or 1 tsp
                        dried)
   1      teaspoon      dried basil leaves -- ( I prefer 1Tb
                        fresh)
     1/2  teaspoon      pepper -- (I use a bit less
                        of restaurant grind)

1). Spray large (5+ Quart), non-stick saucepan lightly with Pam. Saute onions
 over medium heat until almost translucent.  Add garlic and dry beef mix (if 
using).  Continue cooking until onion is translucent. (I like my onions lightly 
browned).

2). Stir in remaining ingredients except for V-8, water and Bovril.  Cover and cook
 over low heat for about 10 minutes.

3). Add 3 cups of water, V-8 juice and liquid Bovril (if using), and bring to a 
boil.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer about 20 minutes (until vegetables are soft).

4). Use a slotted spoon to remove about 2 cups of vegetables from pan; set aside.

5). Allow soup to cool to room temperature.  Puree remaining soup in a blender 
in small batches. (I use my Braun  hand blender right in the pot) 

6). Return pureed mixture and reserved vegetables to saucepan and heat.

This soup is especially good with 7 - 8 fat-free cracked pepper crackers
 (which count as one bread serving/point).

I like to microwave 1 1/2 cups of this soup for about 2 minutes (150 °F) and
 eat with the crackers about 30 minutes before lunch.

Nutrition estimated by MasterCook 5 (with assorted sliced veggies linked  
to frozen California-blend):

79 cals, trace fat (4% CFF), 5g fiber

I have also made WW veggie soup in my crockpot.  I just brown the onions 
first and then throw everything into the crockpot on low for however many
 hours I'll be gone(usually all day).  You can't really mess this up -- just make
 sure that the veggies are as soft as you like them. I usually saute
 large quantities of onions and mushrooms and keep (freezer-weight) 
ziplocks of them in the freezer for making soups and adding bulk to my suppers.

Make it by topping a layer of fresh fruit with batter and baking; the
resulting texture is between that of a puding and a cake.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   4      fillets       fresh or frozen sole or flounder (3-4 oz) -- 1/4-1/2" thick
   2      tablespoons   mayonnaise or salad dressing
   2      tablespoons   plain yogurt
     1/2  teaspoon      fresh tarragon -- snipped
   1      pound         fresh asparagus
   4                    lemon -- thinly sliced
   2                    green onions -- thinly sliced
   4      sprigs        fresh tarragon
                        tarragon sprigs (optional)

Thaw fish, if frozen.

For sauce, combine mayonnaise or salad dressing, yogurt, and 1/2 
teaspoon tarragon. Cover and chill until serving time. Break off and 
discard woody bases from asparagus. Cut asparagus into 4-inch pieces.

Tear off four 24x18-inch pieces of foil. Fold each in half crosswise 
to make 12x18-inch rectangles. Place a fish fillet on each foil square, 
tucking thin ends under. Top each fillet with a lemon slice. Divide green 
onions and asparagus evenly among fillets. Top each with a tarragon sprig. 
Bring up two opposite edges of foil and seal with double fold. Then
fold remaining hands to completely enclose, leaving space for steam to build.

Grill packets on an uncovered grill directly over medium coals about 15
minutes or just until fish begins to flake easily when tested with a fork. 
Serve with sauce. Garnish with additional tarragon sprigs, if desired. 

To grill by indirect heat: Arrange preheated coals around a drip pan 
in a covered grill. Test for medium heat above pan. Place packets on grill 
over drip pan. Cover and grill about 20 minutes or just until fish begins 
to flake easily when tested with a fork.

   2      tablespoons   milk
   1 1/2  cups          powdered sugar -- sifted
     1/2  teaspoon      vanilla

Grease a 9x9x2-inch baking pan; set aside. In a medium saucepan melt butter
or margarine and chocolate over low heat. Stir in granulated sugar, eggs,
and vanilla. Using a wooden spoon, beat lightly by hand just till combined.
Stir in flour.

Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake in a 350-degree F. oven for 20 minutes.
Cool in pan on a wire rack. Spread Chocolate Glaze over the cooled brownies,
if desired. Cut into bars. Sprinkle with powdered sugar, if desired. Store
in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.

Chocolate Glaze: In a saucepan cook and stir 3 tablespoons butter or
margarine, 2 tablespoons unsweeteened cocoa powder, and 2 tablespoons milk
until mixture comes to a boil. Remove from heat. Stir in 1-1/2 cups sifted
powdered sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla until smooth.

Caramel-Nut Brownies: Prepare Five-Way Fudge Brownies as directed, except
stir 1/2 cup chopped pecans into the batter before spreading in the prepared
pan. Sprinkle batter with 1/2 cup miniature semisweet chocolate pieces. Bake
as directed. In a small saucepan combine one 6-1/4-ounce package vanilla
caramels and 2 tablespoons milk. Cook and stir over medium-low heat until
smooth. Drizzle the caramel atop brownies. Cool completely. Cut into bars.

Peanut Butter Brownies: Prepare Five-Way Fudge Brownies as directed. For
frosting, in a medium mixing bowl beat 1/4 cup peanut butter until fluffy.
Gradually add 1 cup sifted powdered sugar, beating well. Beat in 1/4 cup
milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Gradually beat in about 1/2 cup additional

   1      cup           warm water (100°to 110°)
   2      tablespoons   olive oil -- divided
   1      tablespoon    honey
   1      teaspoon      grated orange rind
     1/2  teaspoon      salt

     1/2  teaspoon      aniseed

Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl, let stand 5 minutes. Stir

Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to 
coat top. Cover dough and let rise in a warm place (85°), free
from drafts, 45 minutes or until doubled in size. (Press two fingers
into dough. If indentation remains, the dough has risen enough.) Punch

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   3 1/2  pounds        fresh prickly pears -- (abt 18 med)
   1      cup           water
   1      cup           sugar
   3      tablespoons   freshly squeezed lime juice

Cut a 1/2-inch slice off both ends of the prickly pears, then make a
1/2-inch deep incision down one side, end to end. Carefully (there are
spines) peel off the rind, starting from your incision. If the prickly pear
is ripe, the rind will easily peel away. Roughly chop the peeled fruit.

Place the fruit in a blender or food processor. Add water, sugar and lime
juice and blend for several minutes, or until the sugar is dissolved. Strain
through a medium-mesh sieve. Taste for sweetness, adding more sugar or lime
juice if necessary. Chill thoroughly.

Pour chilled mixture into canister of ice cream freezer and freeze according
to manufacturer's directions. When the ice comes out of the machine, it may
be rather soft; for a firmer texture, let it ``ripen'' in your freezer for a
couple of hours before serving.

Preheat oven to 350F. Spray 8x8 baking pan with nonstick spray.

In a large bowl mix flour, sugar, baking soda, salt and cocoa. Sift if
needed. Stir in milk, applesauce and vanilla. Spread in prepared pan. Mix
remaining ingredients in a medium size bowl stirring to blend. Pour over
batter and DO NOT stir. Bake for 40 minutes and serve warm scooping sauce
from the bottom.

As it bakes a fudgy sauce forms on the bottom. The thickness of this sauce
depends on the amount of water used. 1 cup of water makes a pudding like
consistency that gets thinner the more water you add. I used 1 1/4 c water
for a medium thick sauce. Serve with a fat free frozen yogurt spooning sauce
over - no one will ever know the fat is missing! Extremely addicting and
yummy!

NOTES : At i. Cugini restaurant in Santa Monica, the culinary accent 
is Italian, as clearly expressed by this salad. It flaunts the colors 
of Italy's flag--red, white, and green--with three kinds of leaves, 
each of which has a slightly bitter edge. Italians like to play this 
edge against creamy pastas and juicy steaks. A number of other 
countries--including Mexico, Ireland, India, and Madagascar--fly 
these colors too; the salad could be served with equal patriotic zeal 
in 10 nations.

       think of ways to make a lighter version, and I've come up with
       this recipe that uses substitutes for the heavier ingredients. --

   1      medium        yellow summer squash -- sliced
   2                    beaten eggs
   1      16 oz tub     low-fat cottage cheese
   1      15 oz tub     light ricotta cheese

Layer three of the cooked noodles in prepared dish. Spread with one-third of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with one-third of the vegetable mixture and 1 cup of the mozarella cheese. Repeat layers twice more.

Bake, covered, in a 375 degree oven for 45 to 50 minutes or until heated through. Uncover; let stand for 10 minutes before cutting to serve. Makes 8 main-dish servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      cup           all-purpose flour
   2      teaspoons     baking powder
   2      tablespoons   sugar
     1/2  teaspoon      salt
   1      cup           buttermilk
   2      tablespoons   drained applesauce
   2      large         egg whites

In a medium mixing bowl, whisk and stir together the flour, baking powder,
sugar and salt until combined, about 20 seconds. Set aside. Place a medium
non-stick skillet over medium heat and add 1/4 teaspoon vegetable oil.
While the skillet is heating, add the buttermilk, drained applesauce and
egg to a medium mixing bowl and whisk until combined, or about 20-25
seconds. With a rubber spatula fold and stir the flour mixture in until
combined and almost smooth, or about 30 seconds. Fold a paper towel into
eighths and, using it as pad, spread the vegetable oil over the surface of
the skillet. When a few drops of water skitter and dance on the surface of
the skillet, pour a generous half cup of batter into the center. Tip the
skillet gently to spread the batter out a little. Cook until bubbles appear
in the center. Flip over and cook for two minutes more or until the pancake
when pressed in the center, springs back.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1                    egg
     1/4  cup           liquid egg substitute
     1/2  cup           brown sugar
   2      tablespoons   unsweetened applesauce

     3/4  teaspoon      baking soda
     1/2  teaspoon      salt
     3/4  cup           raisins

Beat the eggs and the brown sugar together until foamy and the sugar is
somewhat dissolved. Stir in the applesauce, bananas and buttermilk mixing
well between each addition. Sift the dry ingredients together and stir into
the liquids along with the raisins. Spray a 9" loaf pan with nonstick spray
and spoon in the batter, smoothing the top out with a spatula. Bake on the
middle rack of a preheated oven until deep golden, the center bounces back
to your touch and a skewer comes out clean (or with crumbs) rather than wet.
Check the bread after 45 minutes but it will usually take at least one hour.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1 1/4  cups          flour
   1 1/4  cups          whole wheat flour -- * see note
     2/3  cup           unsweetened cocoa powder
   2      cups          skim milk
   2      cups          splenda -- **see note
   2      tablespoons   white vinegar
   1      teaspoon      vanilla
     2/3  cup           unsweetened applesauce

Beat everything together and put into a 9 x 13 pan sprayed with nonstick 
cooking spray.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.   Cool and serve with 
fat free cool whip and your choice of toppings.

* using all white flour does not change the points, it's close, it does 
change the amount of fiber.
** Splenda is made from sugar and is the only low calorie sweetner that can 
be used in cooking, or baking and it is ZERO calories.  Using sugar instead 
of splenda adds 28 points to the entire recipe.  That would make each 
serving 4.2 points.  If Splenda is not available in your area you can order 
it online at http://www.splenda.com/

NOTES: You have to try this to believe that it could be 2 points in 1/12th 
of a 9x13 pan.  I served it for Easter with 2 T.Cool Whip Free and 1/2 cup 
Strawberries per piece for a total of 3 points.  Really good!

     3/4  cup           sugar for caramelizing

 200      grams         amaretti cookies -- very finely crushed
                        (1 1/4 cups)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

Put the 3/4 cup sugar in a small saucepan and place over moderate heat. Cook
until sugar dissolves and turns a rich golden-brown, gently swirling skillet
as necessary to dissolve sugar (don't stir). Add water and stir until
incorporated. Pour caramel into an 8-inch round baking dish or pan.
Beat the eggs with the sugar until light. Stir in cocoa, espresso, milk and
crushed cookies, in that order. Pour mixture into baking dish. Cover with
foil. Bake about 50 minutes. The custard should crack in the middle when
done -- this is OK. Cool completely. If there is time, cover and refrigerate
at least 8 hours.

Before serving, bring to cool-room temperature; then unmold onto a large
plate.

In a small skillet heat margarine or butter over medium heat until melted. Add green pepper and onion. Cook over medium heat about 5 minutes or until tender. Stir in brown sugar, mustard, and caraway seed. Add sauerkraut; toss to mix. Tear off a 36x18-inch piece of heavy foil. Fold in half to make a double thickness of foil that measures 18x18 inches. Place sauerkraut mixture in center of foil. Bring up two opposite edges of foil and seal with double fold. Then fold remaining ends to completely enclose sauerkraut mixture, leaving space for steam to build. Prick the bratwurst in several places with a fork or the tip of a sharp knife.

Arrange preheated coals around a drip pan in a covered grill. Test for medium heat above the pan. Place bratwurst and the foil packet on grill over pan. Cover and grill for 20 to 25 minutes or until bratwurst juices run clear, turning bratwurst over once. To serve, toast cut sides of buns on grill. Serve bratwurst in the buns and top with sauerkraut mixture.

   2      cups          almonds -- whole
     1/4  cup           honey
   2      tsp.          grated orange peel
   1 1/2  tsp.          ground cinnamon
     1/2  tsp.          ground allspice
     1/2  tsp.          freshly ground nutmeg -- or grated
   1      cup           chopped dried apricots
   1      cup           pitted dates -- finely chopped
   1      cup           confectioner's sugar

Preheat oven to 400 deg.F.  Arrange almonds on a baking sheet in a single 
layer and toast in oven for 10 minutes.  Cool and finely chop (I'll use 
food processor).   Meanwhile, combine honey, orange zest, cinnamon, 
allspice and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Add almonds, apricots and dates - mix 
well.  Pinch off rounded teaspoon size pieces of the mixture and roll into 
balls.   (Rinse your hands often, as mixture tends to be sticky).   Roll 
balls in sugar then refrigerate in single layers between 2 layers of wax 
paper in airtight containers for up to one month.   They taste better if 
allowed to sit for several days to let the flavors merge.   These are also 
affectionately referred to as "Biker's Bonbons".   This recipe was in this 
month's issue ot "Saveur" Magazine and they looked really good and fairly 
easy to make.

Makes about 75 bon bons.

NOTES : Roasted and peeled peppers are not only more flavorful, but much more
digestible.

This zesty vegetable side dish is a perfect complement to roast meat
and frybread. A combination of seasonal, colorful peppers may be roasted and
added for savory flavor and to turn up the heat, if desired

Tip
When recipes call for ground turkey or chicken, why not make your own? If you have a food processor, it will only take a min.-and you can control the fat content. Use skinless, boneless breasts, and you'll have the leanest grind possible. Cut into 1" cubes and pulse several times until evenly ground.

Place the first 9 ingredients in a soup pot and saute for 10 minutes. Add
the chicken stock and seasonings and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, cook the
pasta in another pot, drain and rinse. Add to the soup and cook for
another 5 minutes. Adjust the seasonings and serve with grated cheese,
parsley and croutons on top.

* Savoy cabbage will produce a milder taste than regular cabbage.
The longer the pasta is in the soup the more liquid it will soak up and
the thicker, and less brothy, it will be.

NOTES : Drain cooked pasta in a colander over a bowl, holding back about
       1/2 cup cooking liquid. Allow the pasta to drain a few minutes,
       and then return it to the pot, and toss it with a little of the
       reserved cooking liquid; this eliminates the need to add oil to
       keep the strands of pasta from sticking. Stir the pasta gently
       with the sauce, adding some of the reserved cooking liquid as
       needed to keep the pasta moist.

* To prepare yogurt cheese, spoon 3 cups plain nonfat yogurt into a coffee
filter or cheesecloth-lined strainer; place over a bowl.  Refrigerate,
covered, at least 5 hours, or overnight. Discard the liquid in the bowl.

Makes 1 1/2 cups yogurt cheese.

When using rosemary or any fresh herb sprig as a garnish for a dessert or 
drink, dip the sprig in ice water and shake off the excess. Then coat the 
sprig with granulated sugar, shaking off excess and placing on wax paper;
freeze for 30 minutes. Not only does it make an attractive garnish, it
becomes a flavorful breath freshener, or swizzle stick.

NOTES : Here's an elegant dessert that is reminiscent of the classic Peach Melba. Our version uses tangy nonfat yogurt cheese
instead of ice cream. The addition of rosemary gives it a complex and unexpected flavor; one that you would expect to find in
gourmet ice cream.

             Perfect Lemon Bars- Cook's Illustrated (2.5 PTS)

Serving Size  : 24   Preparation Time :1:10
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        THE CRUST:
   1 3/4  cups          all-purpose flour
     2/3  cup           confectioners sugar -- plus extra to decora
     1/4  cup           cornstarch
     3/4  teaspoon      salt
  12      tablespoons   unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks) at very coo -- cut into 1" pieces
                        extra  unsalted butter for greasing pan
                        LEMON FILLING:
   4      large         eggs -- beaten lightly
   1 1/3  cups          granulated sugar
   3      tablespoons   all-purpose flour
   2      teaspoons     finely grated zest from two large lemons
     2/3  cup           juice from 3 to 4 large lemons -- strained
     1/3  cup           whole milk
     1/8  teaspoon      salt

1. For the crust: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly butter a 13-by-9-inch baking dish and line with one sheet parchment or wax paper. Dot paper with butter, then lay second sheet crosswise over it. 

2. Pulse flour, confectioners sugar, cornstarch, and salt in food processor workbowl fitted with steel blade. Add butter and process to blend, 8 to 10 seconds, then pulse until mixture is pale yellow and resembles coarse meal, about three 1-second bursts. (To do this by hand, mix flour, confectioners sugar, cornstarch, and salt in medium bowl. Freeze butter and grate it on large holes of box grater into flour mixture. Toss butter pieces to coat. Rub pieces between your fingers for a minute, until flour turns pale yellow and coarse.) Sprinkle mixture into lined pan and press firmly with fingers into even, 1/4-inch layer over entire pan bottom and about 1/2 inch up sides. Refrigerate for 30 minutes, then bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. 

3. For the filling: Meanwhile, whisk eggs, sugar, and flour in medium bowl, then stir in lemon juice, zest, milk, and salt to blend well.

4. To finish the bars: Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees. Stir filling mixture to reblend; pour into warm crust. Bake until filling feels firm when touched lightly, about 20 minutes. Transfer pan to wire rack; cool to near room temperature, at least 30 minutes.Transfer to cutting board, fold paper down, and cut into serving-size bars, wiping knife or pizza cutter clean between cuts, as necessary. Sieve confectioners sugar over bars, if desired.

NOTES : The challenge: Lemon bars are a casual treat to make without a lot of fuss. Still, they have their requirements, and we wanted to learn how to make the best lemon bars possible with a simple and straightforward recipe. The filling should be light and very lemony, the crust tender, ready to melt in you mouth. We also wanted everything to come together in a way that made it possible to cut up the bars cleanly and serve them neatly. The solution: We tackled the crust first, knowing that our basic ingredients would be flour, butter, and sugar and that the outcome should be more like a cookie or a shortbread than a pastry-type crust. This type of crust generally calls for a fair amount of sugar and no water (which is wanted in pastry crusts to create pockets of steam that produce flakiness and layering). White granulated sugar is often the first bakers turn to for the sort of crust we were after, but we discovered that confectioners sugar gave us the most tender texture. 

                   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

NOTES : The lemon filling must be added to a warm crust. The 30-minute chilling and 20-minute baking of the crust should allow plenty of time to prepare the filling. If not, make the filling first and stir to blend just before pouring it into the crust. Any leftover bars can be sealed in plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to two days.

These take only minutes to make, but are elegant and festive. Look for lemon
curd in the jelly and jam aisle of your supermarket. If you cant find it,
vanilla pudding or pie mix will do the trick.

NOTES : Everyone loves the delicious flavor of mouth-watering pizza. 
Depending on its ingredients, it can be a nutritional heavyweight. 
That is especially true of stuffed pizza. Pizza sauce, cheese and 
toppings are stuffed inside two layers of pizza dough. But you can 
trim the fat to enjoy the wonderful flavor of a freshly prepared 
pizza.

NOTES : Roasting the onions is what gives this dip it's phenomenal flavor. As you
may know, I am hosting an appetizer get together this holiday season, so
I've slowly been trying different things that I am going to be including on
the menu - THIS is definitely going to make it to the table! I think my
favorite way to serve it is on chunks of fresh soft French bread, though it
WAS good on Melba rounds... It's also great with fresh veggie sticks to dip
in, but the bread... Ah, the bread was my favorite!

             Roasted Peppers with Saffron and Basil (.5 PTS)

Recipe By     : The Savory Way
Serving Size  : 8    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      large         bell peppers (red and yellow) -- with thick flesh
                        extra-virgin olive oil
   1                    garlic cloves -- thinly sliced
                        - (1 to 2)
                        salt
                        freshly ground pepper
                        red wine vinegar -- or balsamic vinegar

STOVE TOP GAS BURNER: To roast, set them directly in the flame. Turn them
every few minutes so that the entire surface is exposed to the flame and the
skin is eventually charred all over. Set the finished peppers in a bowl,
cover it with a plate, and allow it to stand for at least 10 minutes to
steam.

GRILLING: Grill, turning as needed. Once roasted, they can be put into a
covered dish to steam and then finished at your leisure.

BROILER OF AN ELECTRIC OVEN: Set them on the top rack, right under the heat,
turn them frequently until they are completely charred, then put into a
covered dish to steam and then finished at your leisure.

HOT OVEN: Another way to roast peppers in the oven is to cut them in half,
brush them with light oil on both sides and set them, cut side down, on a
cookie sheet, in a hot oven (400degF). After ten minutes or so the skins
will be wrinkled and loose. Set the pepper halves in a covered bowl to steam
then peel. Since they haven't been charred, they won't have that smoky
flavor, but they will be softened by the cooking and the skins will be easy
to remove.

PEELING: Carefully scrape away the charred peel with a knife. Save any of
the syrupy juices that collect in the bottom of the bowl. Cut open the
pepper, scrape out the seeds, cut the flesh into strips, and add them to the
bowl with the juices. Toss with the olive oil, add the garlic, and season
lightly with salt, pepper, and vinegar, to taste. Store in a covered jar in
the refrigerator.

MAKES 2 CUPS, STORE covered and refrigerated for one or two weeks.

USES: They can be cut into wide strips and used as a little hors d'oeuvre or
salad, garnished with olives, herbs, a splash of vinegar, or thin slices of
Fontina cheese. Cut into thin strips, they can fill a sandwich, garnish a
pizza, or become part of a composed salad. Diced into squares, they can be
tossed with pasta or cooked with rice or millet, as in Millet Pilaf (see
recipe) with Saffron Peppers (see below).

VARIATION:

Roasted Peppers with Saffron and Basil

Roast the peppers as described above and cut them into strips. Warm 1
tablespoon of olive oil, add a pinch of saffron threads, and let stand until
cooled. Pour over the peppers, add several torn fresh basil leaves, and toss
together. The saffron flavor will continue to deepen as the peppers sit.

                        --
                        warmed

Preheat broiler.  Place tomatillos and garlic on rimmed baking sheet and
broil, turning occasionally, until tomatillo skins shrivel and brown in
spots, 6 to 8 minutes.  Set aside to cool briefly.

Place broiled tomatillos and garlic in food processor along with chile
and cilantro.  Pulse until almost smooth.  Add salt to taste.

Meanwhile, heat oil in large nonstick skillet.  Add tofu and cook over
medium-high heat, turning cubes occasionally, until nicely browned,
about 6 minutes.  Transfer tofu to plate lined with paper towels.

Add pepper to empty skillet, reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring
occasionally until softened, about 5 minutes.

Place some spinach on bottom half of each wrap.  Spoon some bell peppers
and tofu over spinach and then drizzle with tomatillo salsa.  Roll up
wraps, tucking sides toward center to form bundles.  Slice each roll in
half and serve immediately.

4 WW POINTS

Tomatillos, green tomato-like fruits with
papery husks, are broiled to soften their texture and give them a smoky
flavor.  Once softened, they are puréed with garlic, chipotle chile, and
cilantro to make a quick salsa.  In Mexico, this salsa is used to
moisten chicken and seafood, but it's just as good with cubes of browned
tofu.  Canned chipotles in adobo are smoked, dried jalapeños packed in a
vinegary tomato sauce.

   1      tb            Parmesan cheese -- grated

   1                    tomato -- (8 slices)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Spray baking sheet with non-stick spray.
Thaw spinach, squeeze dry.  Combine spinach, ricotta, parmesan cheese and
garlic.

Divide dough into 4 pieces, roll each to 6" circle. (I probably would make
up my own dough if I had time but the pre-prepared isn't bad.) Spread
spinach mix to within 1/4" of edges of each circle.  Place 1 1/2 oz  turkey and 2 tomato
slices one on half of circle.  Fold over and seal by pressing edges with
fork. Place on prepared baking sheet, bake 12-15 minutes, until browned.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12      Bags          spinach leaves, whole -- washed well
   3      Pounds        leeks -- chopped finely
  15                    green onion, whole -- chopped finely
   3      Bunches       dill -- chopped
   4      Bunches       parsley -- tops only
   2      Bunches       mint leaves
   3      Pounds        feta cheese -- crumbled
   3      Boxes         filo dough
   1      Cup           olive oil
                        Hand Full     salt

1) Wash and clean all veggies very well!, when clean run gr onions and leeks 
thru food processer.

2) Combine spinach and gr onions and leeks together in sink, you may have to 
put half aside there will be alot!salt well, but not to much since feta is 
salty! and mix it around let it sit for at least 30 min or if you are 
pressed for time put in container in fridge over night!

3) next we take the veggies and in other sink squeeze as much of liquid out 
as we can, this part is not easy and time consuming but if done right you 
will have crispy pita and if not they may turn out soggy! First time around 
i suggest leaving in fridge over night it does most of the work for ya!

4) When squeezing is done take veggies and put in bowl combine half of feta 
and 1/2 cup oil, You can use less..but with my husband being greek much more 
less then this he complains of not tasting the oil!

5)take 2 sheets of fillo spray in between with butter flavored spray. lay a 
good sized amount of veggie mix in like a log roll .roll the 2 sides over 
and then start rolling , you will almost have a huge boritto shaped pita!

Then wrap in tin foil and freeze laying flat in freezer or to cook 
right away 350 - 450 45 min to a hour. Mine is a gas stove and takes a bit 
longer ..i like to cook low and for longer to make sure it cooks good 
inside!

This makes 11-13 pitas at 3 poinits each serving , 1/4 of pita!
All ingrediants vary points wise  a great deal more than i thought they 
would , we buy our stuff from a greek store an dbuy thesame brand so i dont 
have to refigure points! you can half this recipe or even 1/4 it but i like 
to keep a bunch in freezer, when i have unexpected company for supper i can 
pull out and pop in! Hope you enjoy!

I figured points individually so yours may vary, depending on your product!

   2 1/2  cups          fresh strawberries -- sliced thick
     1/4  cup           fine chopped walnuts

Set the oven rack to the middle and preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Lightly spray the interior bottom and sides of two 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf
pans with the vegetable oil. Dust with flour, knocking out excess. Set
aside. In a medium mixing bowl whisk or stir the flour, cinnamon, baking
soda and salt together. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl of an electric
mixer, beat the egg and egg whites on medium speed until frothy about 30
seconds. Stop the mixer. Add the vanilla, black walnut flavor, Butter Buds,
applesauce and sugar, and mix on medium speed until the sugar seems to
dissolve. By hand, stir in the strawberries. Add the dry ingredients,
stirring until just moistened, about 20 seconds. The batter will appear
slightly lumpy. Divide the batter equally between the prepared loaf pans.
Dust the top of each with 1/4-cup of the walnuts. Bake for 60 minutes or
until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in the pans
on wire racks for 5 minutes. Lift the breads out onto a wire rack and cool
completely.

JaneStarr's Freezer Suggestions:
Prepare as above in steps 3 & 4.  Place chicken (or ground beef, if you 
choose) mixture in a freezer zip-loc bag and freeze.  Thaw
in refrigerator the night before serving.  Continue with the rest of the 
directions.  Bake in a pre-heated 350° F oven for 25-30
minutes(until hot throughout dish).

Alternate Suggestion.  Prepare casserole through step 6 prior to freezing.  
Thaw overnight .  Top with cheese and bake as directed.

I doubled  this recipe and switched from an 8X8 to a 9X13" pan. YUM!!

   6      cups          tomato puree
   6      cups          fat-free chicken broth
   1      large         onion -- chopped
   2      stalks        celery -- chopped
   3      large         garlic cloves -- minced
   1      tablespoon    olive oil
   1      cup           carrots -- chopped
   1      medium        zucchini -- chopped
   1 1/2  c             corn
   4      medium        potatoes -- chopped

     1/2  cup           fresh basil leaves -- chopped
   1      tablespoon    fresh thyme -- minced
   2                    bay leaves
                        salt and pepper

  Saute onions, celery and garlic in the olive oil in the bottom of a
dutch oven or other soup pot. When tender, add remaining ingredients.
Simmer 15-20 minutes until vegetables are tender.

NOTES: I had a lot of tomatoes from the garden, so I whizzed them in the
blender, then strained out the skin and seeds. It came out the consistency
somewhere between sauce and juice. I guess you could use a combo of these
if you didn't want to make your own. Or use V-8.
  You can use any veggies you want. I actually added broccoli stems the
first time I made it. I peeled them them chopped them up and dumped them
in.
  1/4 - 1/2 cup of small pasta shapes per serving is good with this, too,
but cook it separately and add to soup in the serving bowl. If you add it
to the soup kettle, it will soak up all the juice and get mushy.
  This freezes really well. I put it in 2-cup deli containers and had
lunches ready for a week!

soft and easy to peel. But if you want to bypass that step, just use very 
ripe peeled peaches, and purée them with the honey.

   1      can           green chiles -- chopped

     1/2  bunch         cilantro -- chopped--optional
   1      pound         lowfat jack cheese -- grated

In a large saucepan, heat a small amount of oil and saute the onion.  When 
the onion is translucent, add chicken. Cook for a couple of minutes, max.  
Don't let it stick and don't add a ton of oil to keep it cooking either.

Add everything else, except the cilantro and cheese.  If you want, after 
sauteeing the chicken and onion together, finish the recipe in a crock pot. 
If you do, cook on high for about 3 hours or so, if you want it to cook all 
day, put it on low.  You just need to get it nice and hot.  If you are doing 
this on the stove top, simmer for about 20 minutes.

Serve in nice big bowls, sprinkle with cilantro if you like, and some grated 
cheese.  Served with buttermilk cornbread and a big salad, this is a 
wonderful meal.

Yield: 8 servings easily.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  14 1/2  ounces        fat free sweetened condensed milk
  12      ounces        reduced fat chocolate chips

Melk together and poor into an 8x8 pan. Cool in fridge for one hour.

Yield: 64 pieces.

VARIATION:
For a low fat version, I used fat free sweetened condensed milk and reduced
fat chocolate chips.  For those of you who might follow WW, that's one point
each. I think it comes out to about slightly more than on gram per piece.

Recipe By     : 
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : 
  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   1      cup           diced onion
   8      teaspoons     instant chicken broth granules or
   8      packets       instant chicken broth & seasoning mix
   8      cloves        minced garlic -- (equal to 4 tsp.)
   9      cups          assorted sliced veggies -- *see Note
   1                    tomato -- seeded & chopped
   4      teaspoons     fresh parsley -- chopped (or 1 tsp
                        dried)
   1      teaspoon      dried basil leaves -- ( I prefer 1Tb
                        fresh)
     1/2  teaspoon      pepper -- (I use a bit less
                        of restaurant grind)

INSTRUCTIONS:
1). Spray large (5+ Quart), non-stick saucepan lightly with Pam. Saute onions
 over medium heat until almost translucent.  Add garlic and dry chicken mix.
  Continue cooking until onion is translucent. ( I like my onions lightly browned).

2). Stir in remaining ingredients.  Cover and cook over low heat for about 10 
minutes.

3). Add 8 cups of water and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat, cover and simmer 
about 20 minutes (until vegetables are soft).

4). Use a slotted spoon to remove about 2 cups of vegetables from pan; 
set aside.

5). Allow soup to cool to room temperature.  Puree remaining soup in a blender
 in small batches. (I plan to use my new hand blender right in the pot)

6). Return pureed mixture and reserved vegetables to saucepan and heat.
Enjoy as an unlimited vegetable on the Weight Watchers plan!

This soup is especially good with 7 - 8 fat-free cracked pepper crackers
 (which count as one bread serving/point).

I like to microwave 1 1/2 cups of this soup for about 2 minutes (150 °F) and
 eat with the crackers about 30 minutes before lunch.

Per MasterCook: 69 cals, 1g fat (14% CFF), 4g fiber

This is a "free food" per WW leaders and materials.  Enjoy!

flakes add a salty flavor to the tofu. Look for them in Asian markets.
