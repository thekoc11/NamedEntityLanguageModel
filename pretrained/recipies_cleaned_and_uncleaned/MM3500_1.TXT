  pan bottom well. Stir in the milk and catsup. Continue cooking for
  about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and allow
  mixture to cool to room temperature.
  Place the ground beef and pork in an ungreased 13x9-inch baking pan.
  Add the eggs, the cooked vegetable mixture and the bread crumbs,
  remove the bay leaves. Mix by hand until thoroughly combined. In the
  center of the pan, shape the mixture into a loaf that is about 1-1/2
  inches high, 6 inches wide and 12 inches long. Bake uncovered at 350F
  for 25 minutes, then raise heat to 400F and continue cooking until
  done, about 35 minutes longer. Serve immediately as is or with Very
  Hot Cajun Sauce for Beef.
  This is best using both ground pork and ground beef, as the pork
  gives more flavor diversity. However, you can make it with ground
  beef only. From Paul Prudhomme's "Louisiana Kitchen"

      8 ea New red potatoes                  1/2 c  Ground white pepper

      1 c  Salt                           
 
  Fill a large (10-quart) stockpot one-third full with water. Add the
  lemons, potatoes, corn, onions, salt, and peppers. Cover and bring to
  a boil over high heat.
   Let boil for 10 minutes. Add the crabs, (if blue crabs are not
  available, substitute other small to medium crabs), cover, and return
  to boil. Once steam starts to escape from under the cover, let cook

      Title: Smothered Round Steak
 Categories: Cajun/creol, Main dish, Beef, Vegetable
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Round steak                       1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      2 t  Salt                                3 ea Medium onions, chopped
    1/2 t  Ground black pepper                 2 ea Bell peppers, chopped
      1 t  Ground red pepper                   1 ea Celery rib, chopped
      1 t  Ground white pepper                 1 c  Beef stock or water
      1 x  All-purpose flour (dredging)   
 
  Alex Patout says, "Smothering is a multipurpose Cajun technique that
  works wonders with everything from game to snap beans. It's similar
  to what the rest of the world knows as braising--the ingredients are
  briefly browned or sauteed, then cooked with a little liquid over a
  low heat for a long time." Season the roast with one half of the salt
  and peppers. Dust with flour on all sides.  Heat the oil in a Dutch
  oven or other large heavy pot over medium-high heat, add the steak,
  and brown well on all sides. Remove the meat and pour off all but 1
  teaspoon of the oil. Add half the onions, bell peppers, celery, and
  the other half of the seasonings, and the stock or water.  Stir well
  and reduce the heat to the lowest possible point.
   Return the roast to the pot and cover with the remaining vegetables.
  Cover and let cook until the meat is very tender, about 1 hour and 15
  minutes. Serve the meat in slices, with rice alongside and the gravy
  over all. When you try this recipe with other kinds of meat, be sure
  to adjust the cooking times accordingly--let tenderness be your
  guide. For extra flavorful roasts, try larding with slivers of garlic
  before smothering. Serves 4-6 From Alex Patout's "Cajun Home Cooking"

      Title: Blackened Redfish
 Categories: Cajun/creol, Main dish, Fish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6 ea 8-10oz redfish fillets            3/4 lb Unsalted butter, melted

MMMMM-----------------------SEASONING MIX----------------------------
      1 T  Sweet paprika                     3/4 t  Ground white pepper
  2 1/2 t  Salt                              3/4 t  Ground black pepper
      1 t  Onion powder                      1/2 t  Dried thyme leaves
      1 t  Garlic powder                     1/2 t  Dried oregano leaves
      1 t  Ground cayenne pepper          
 
  NOTE: Fish fillets (preferably redfish, pompano or tilefish) cut
  about 1/2 inch thick.  Redfish and pompano are ideal for this method
  of cooking. If tilefish is used, you may have to split the fillets in
  half horizontally to have proper thickness.  If you can't get any of
  these fish, salmon steaks or red snapper fillets can be substituted.
  In any case, the fillets or steaks must not be more than 3/4 inch
  thick. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over very high heat until it is
  beyond the smoking stage and you see white ash in the skillet bottom
  (the skillet cannot be too hot for this dish), at least 10 minutes.
  (FT - this recipe is *NOT* for the faint of heart) Meanwhile, pour 2
  Tablespoons melted butter in each of 6 small ramekins; set aside and
  keep warm.  Reserve the remaining butter in its skillet. Heat the
  serving plates in a 250F oven. Thoroughly combine the seasoning mix
  ingredients in a small bowl. Dip each fillet in the reserved melted
  butter so that both sides are well coated; then sprinkle seasoning
  mix generously and evenly on both sides of the fillets, patting by
  hand. Place in the hot skillet and pour 1 teaspoon melted butter on
  top of each fillet (be careful, as the butter may flame up).  Cook,
  uncovered, over the same high heat until the underside looks charred,
  about 2 minutes (the time will vary according to the fillet's
  thickness and the heat of the skillet). Turn the fish over and again
  pour 1 teaspoon butter on top; cook until fish is done, about 2
  minutes more. Repeat with remaining fillets. Serve each fillet while
  piping hot.
     To serve, place one fillet and a ramekin of butter on each heated
  serving plate. I had this in K Pauls Restaurant in New Orleans. It is
  a taste experience you will never forgive yourself for missing should
  you ever be lucky enough to find yourself in N'awlins and you don't
  go to K Paul's and order this. Even people who don't like fish love
  this dish. From Chef Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen, published by

      6 ea 1-3/4" thick pork chops             1 cn (4 oz) diced green chilies
    3/4 lb Ground pork                         1 c  Pork or chicken stock
      1 c  Chopped onions                    1/2 c  Very fine bread crumbs
      1 c  Chopped green bell peppers        1/2 c  Finely chopped green onions
      2 t  Minced garlic                  
 
  In a food processor or blender, process the apples, 4 Tablespoons of
  the butter, the sugar, vanilla and nutmeg until smooth, about 3 to 4
  minutes. Set aside.
    In a small bowl thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients;
  set aside.
    Prepare the pork chops by cutting a large pocket (to the bone) into
  the larger side of each chop to hold the stuffing. In a large
  skillet, brown the ground pork in the remaining 3 Tbsp. butter over
  high heat, about 3 minutes.  Add the onions, bell peppers, garlic,
  and 2 Tbsp. of the seasoning mix, stirring well; cook about 5
  minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping pan bottom well. Stir in
  the green chilies and their juice and continue cooking until mixture
  is well browned, about 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally and
  scraping the pan bottom as needed.
   Add the stock and cook 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in the
  bread crumbs and cook about 2 minutes more, stirring constantly and
  scraping pan bottom as needed.  Remove from heat.
    Sprinkle the remaining seasoning mix evenly on both sides of the
  chops and inside the pockets, pressing it in by hand. Prop chops with
  pocket side up in an ungreased 13x9-inch baking pan. Spoon about 1/4
  cup stuffing into each pocket; reserve the remaining stuffing. Bake
  chops with pocket up at 400F until the meat is done, about 1 hour 10
  minutes. Place the remaining stuffing in a small pan in the oven for
  the last 20 minutes to reheat. Serve immediately with each chop
  arranged on top of a portion of the remaining stuffing.

 Categories: Cajun/creol, Main dish, Beef
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 lb Prime rib roast (10-1/2 lbs)      1/4 c  Salt
    1/4 c  Black pepper                        2 ea Onions, thinly sliced
    1/4 c  Garlic powder                 

MMMMM------------------SEASONING MIX (OPTIONAL-----------------------
      1 T  Plus 1 tsp, salt                    1 T  Plus 3/4 tsp, black pepper
      1 T  Plus 2 tsp, white pepper        2 1/2 t  Dry mustard
      1 T  Plus 2 tsp, fennel seeds        2 1/2 t  Ground cayenne pepper
 
  Remove fat cap off top of meat (butcher can do this for you) and save.
  Place the roast, standing on the rib bones, in a very large roasting
  pan. Then with a knife make several dozen punctures through the
  silver skin so seasoning can permeate meat.  Pour a very generous,
  even layer of black pepper over the top of the meat (the pepper
  should completely cover it); repeat with the garlic powder, then the
  salt, totally covering the preceding layer.  Carefully arrange the
  onions in an even layer on top so as not to knock off the seasoning.
  Place the fat cap back on top.
   Refrigerate 24 hours. Bake ribs in a 550F oven until the fat is dark
  brown and crispy on top, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven and cool
  slightly.
   Refrigerate until well chilled, about 3 hours.  (this is done so the
  juices will solidify and the steaks can be cooked rare.) Remove fat
  cap and disgard.  With the blade of a large knife, scrape off the
  onions and as much of the seasonings as possible and discard.
   Then with a long knife, slice between ribs into 6 steaks (4 will have
  bones); trim the cooked surface of meat from the 2 pieces that were
  on the outside of the roast. Season and cook in your favorite way for
  steaks. TO BLACKEN THE STEAKS:  Combine the ingredients of the
  seasoning mix thoroughly in a small bowl; you will have about 8
  tablespoons. Sprinkle the steaks generously and evenly on both sides
  with the mix. using about 4 teaspoons on each steak and pressing it
  in with your hands. Heat a cast iron skillet over very high heat
  until it is beyond the smoking stage and you see white ash on the
  skillet bottom--at least 10 minutes. (The skillet cannot be too hot
  for this method.)  Place one steak in the hot skillet (cook only one
  side at a time) and cook over a very high heat until the underside
  starts to develop a heavy, black crust, about 2 to 3 minutes.
   Turn the steak over and cook until the underside is crusted like the
  first, about 2 to 3 minutes more. Repeat with the remaining steaks.
  Serve each steak while piping hot. (*NOTE*: If you don't have a
  commercial hood vent over your stove, this dish may smoke you out of
  the kitchen. It's worth it!  But you can also cook it outdoors on a
  gas grill; a charcoal fire doesn't get hot enough to "blacken" the
  steak properly. If you have a smoke detector in your house, you will
  be able to determine if it is working correctly. This is NOT a dish
  to prepare in an apartment building with a central fire alarm system
  wired into your smoke detector. It causes great excitement! Also, you
  can be guaranteed you will meet your landlord.) From Paul Prudhomme's

  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  +++++++++++++++++++ Preparation:  Trim ends off green onions and cut
  light green and white part into 1" sections. Mix all other sauce
  ingredients in 2-quart saucepan. Reserve. Pull skin off breasts, then
  pull chicken meat from bones. Slice meat into 1" strips, then
  crosswise to make 1" chunks. In bowl large enough to hold chicken,
  add egg white to water chestnut flour. Beat mixture with a single
  chopstick (not an egg beater or whisk).
   Stir chicken pieces into egg mixture to coat thoroughly. Marinate 5
  minutes.  Note: water chestnut flour gives a lighter crust than
  cornstarch, though the latter may be substituted. Deep-frying: Heat
  cooking oil in wok or deep-fryer to medium heat (you'll need more oil
  for deep-fryer).
   Fry peanuts until they are a light tan color; if a test peanut browns
  quickly, turn down heat.  Remove peanuts with strainer or slotted
  spoon; drain on paper towel or paper bag. Reserve. Turn up heat
  slightly for chicken.  Test a chunk first: chicken should raise to
  surface immediately & brown in about 2 minutes.  Deep-fry coated
  chicken chunks until golden brown.  Deep-fry no more than 8 chunks at
  a time. Use long chopsticks or spatula to keep pieces separate while
  they are frying. Remove with long chopsticks or slotted spoon.
  Reserve. Sauce:
   While deep-frying chicken, heat sauce to simmer.  Add green onions &
  peanuts about a minute before serving.
   At the last minute, add chicken pieces to sauce, mix quickly & serve.

  SELECTING THE RIGHT CHOCOLATE:  You'll find three basic types of
  chocolate in the baking supplies department of most
  supermarkets--semisweet chocolate, unsweetened chocolate, and sweet
  chocolate.  The semisweet chocolate is made from chocolate that is
  just slightly sweetened with sugar. Unsweetened chocolate is the
  original baking or cooking chocolate and has no added flavorings or
  sugar.  And sweet chocolate, such as the German cooking chocolate
  used in the Chocolate Pots de Creme recipe, is chocolate mixed with
  sugar and sometimes additional cocoa butter or flavorings.

      1 ea Celery stalk, finely chopped      1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
 
  There are as many versions of vegetable soup in Italy as there there
  are cooks. Pancetta - Pancetta is the same cut of pork as bacon.
   It is cured with salt and is not smoked.  It comes rolled up like a
  large salami.  Widely used in Italian cooking, especially in
  Emilia-Romagna, it is vital to many dishes. If available, buy a large
  quantity. Cut into several pieces and freeze it.  You can substitute
  domestic bacon for pancetta.  It must be blanched in boiling water
  for two three minutes to reduce the smoky flavour. Fresh side pork
  can also be used.
   I'll be posting several recipes over the next while that call for
  pancetta, so if you can find some, it won't go to waste. Prepare
  chicken broth (see my previously posted recipe). Heat oil in a large
  saucepan. Add parsley and garlic.  Saute over medium heat. Before
  garlic changes colour, add pancetta.
   Saute until lightly browned.  Stir in cabbage.  Cover and cook 1 to 2
  minutes. Add remaining vegetables to saucepan. Cover and cook about 5
  minutes.  Add broth and water, if using, and prosciutto rind or ham
  shank.
   Cover and reduce heat.  Simmer 40 to 50 minutes.
   Remove half the vegetables with a slotted spoon.
   Place in a blender or food processor and process until smooth.
  Return to saucepan. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot with
  Parmesan cheese sprinkled over top. Makes 8 to 10 servings.
  VARIATION: Toast about 20 thick slices of Italian bread.  Place 2
  slices in each soup bowl and sprinkle generously with Parmesan
  cheese. Ladle soup into bowls. Serve with additional Parmesan cheese.

      Title: Frances Cook's Bread & Rolls
 Categories: Bread, Londontowne
      Yield: 24 servings
 
    3/4 c  Milk                                1 t  Salt
      1 ea Fresh cake yeast                    1 ea Egg
    1/4 c  Sugar                           3 1/2 c  Flour
      3 T  Shortening                        1/4 c  Lukewarm water
 
  Scald milk and pour over sugar, shortening, & salt. Let it cool to
  lukewarm while softening yeast in a small bowl with the warm water.
  When soft, add the egg and beat together slightly. Pour the yeast/egg
  mixture into the milk mixture and stir them together.
  The flour may be sifted or poured into the liquid. With a large
  spoon, stir until flour/milk is well mixed. You should have a firm,
  but not stiff dough. Without removing it from the bowl, cover the
  dough with a plate or towel and set aside to rise until double in
  bulk (about 2 hrs depending on the temperature in the kitchen).
  Instead of letting the dough rise at this point you may put it in the
  refrigerator and use it later, or the next day. Watch to make sure it
  doesn't spill out of the bowl. If it starts to spill before you're
  ready to use it, punch it back down. Refrigerated dough is easier to
  handle but takes longer to rise.
  BREAD: If you want to make bread, dump the dough out of the bowl onto
  a floured surface and with more flour as needed to keep it from
  sticking, knead it until springy and easy to handle. This dough does
  not require a lot of kneading; only enough to make it easy to handle.
  For 2 medium size loaves cut the dough in half and knead/shape each
  into loaves and put into greased baking pans. Allow about 2 hours for
  the dough to double again. Bake in a 375 degree oven until lightly
  browned on top (if uncertain whether or not bread is done, tip out of
  pan and see if bottom is browned too).
  ROLLS: To make rolls, work and knead dough until springy and easily
  handled. Roll out with a rolling pin and cut with a biscuit cutter
  and fold over and place on a greased cookie sheet (Parkerhouse
  rolls), or break dough into small pieces, make into little balls and
  place 3 in each section of a greased muffin pan (Cloverleaf rolls).
  SWEET ROLLS: For Christmas bread or sweet rolls, roll out dough as for
  Parkerhouse rolls, except trying to make an oblong instead of a round.
  Spread it with raisins and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Dot with
  butter and roll as for a jelly roll. Slice and place on a greased pan
  or make into a circle and make slashes through the dough at
  intervals. Let rise and bake as for loaves. Top with an icing made of
  confectioners' sugar, melted butter, milk, and vanilla or rum
  flavoring and drizzle over the bread or rolls while hot. Decorate
  with nuts or fruits.
  If you want to make a whole wheat bread, use half white and half whole
  wheat flour, and use brown sugar instead of white. The amounts above
  will yield 1 large or 2 medium loaves of bread, or 2 dozen large
  rolls.

  3 1/2 c  Very warm water                     2 T  Salt
 
  This recipe is for 2 loaves of bread. If one loaf is desired, use 2
  packages yeast instead of 3 and cut all other ingredients in half.
  Wheat germ and soya flour may be omitted. Put flour in oven to warm,
  at lowest heat. In a VERY large bowl, dissolve yeast in 3/4 cup of
  very warm water. Add honey to yeast. Coat loaf pans well with
  margarine and flour. Add oil, 2-1/2 cups warm water, and 2T salt
  yeast. Add about 4c flour mixture and beat at medium speed for 2
  minutes. Gradually add more flour, beating well. Dough should be
  sticky - if runny, add more flour. Put in pans, smoothing top and
  making sure dough is pushed into corners. Cover with hot, wet towel
  and let rise in warm place. Check bread in about 20 minutes and keep
  checking to be sure dough doesn't rise over lip of pan. When dough
  has risen ALMOST to lip of pan, bake at 450 degrees for about 40
  mins. Remove from pan immediately and cool on rack. Mrs. William W.

   (I do this part    in a covered casserole in the microwave). Make
  white sauce with    rest of ingredients. If you like a stronger onion
  flavor, thin the    white sauce with part or all of the onion water.
  Otherwise, thin it    with your choice of cream, milk, water, chicken
  broth or whatever
     flavor you like.  Add onions and bake at 325 to 350 until bubbly.

      Yield: 10 servings
 
      2 ea 9-inch layers of choc. Cake       1/3 c  Light Corn Syrup
      1 ea Fudge Icing (Recipe)                1 c  Brown Sugar, firmly packed
      1 ea Caramel Sauce (Recipe)              2 t  Butter

      2 c  Heavy Cream                       1/3 c  Heavy Cream
  2 1/2 lb Semisweet Chocolate            
 
  FOR CAKE:
     Slice round cake layers horizontally in half to make 4 round cake
  layers.  Place 1 layer on plate and top with Fudge Icing, Caramel
  Sauce and Cashews.
   Repeat with next 2 cake layers.  Place final cake layer on top,
  frost top and sides of cake with Fudge Icing and cover sides of cake
  with chopped cashews. FUDGE ICING: Bring cream to boil. Stir in
  chocolate until melted and smooth. This will be very soft but will
  harden when cooled. Refrigerate until workable consistency.
         NOTE: The time it takes to get to a workable consistency
  depends on the weather.  This is much like making fudge candy. The
  author, (Arlene Lightsey), made this sauce on a cool, clear day and
  had no problem. CARAMEL SAUCE: Bring first 4 ingredients to boil and
  reduce to thick syrup. Very carefully, (because it will splatter),
  add cream. Refrigerate until cool. Recipe from Pastry Chef Jenny

  2 1/2 c  Yellow Corn Meal                    1 T  Baking Powder
      1 t  Soda                                1 ea Egg, beaten
      1 t  Salt                                2 c  Buttermilk
      2 T  Granulated Sugar                1 1/2 c  Cooking Oil (about)
      2 T  All-Purpose Flour              
 
  Mix all dry ingredients; beat milk and egg together and combine with
  dry ingredients; batter should hold its shape when picked up in
  spoon. If it is too soft, add more cornmeal. Drop by molded
  Tablespoon into 350"F fat and cook about 1 1/2 minutes; turn and cook
  on second side 1 minute. Allow oil to heat a few seconds after
  removing a batch. Delicious freshly cooked and hot; however, leftover
  hush puppies freeze well. When ready to serve frozen hush puppies,
  place on oven rack in preheated 250"F until very hot and crisp. Makes
  about 48 hush puppies 2" round. Hints on frying: Using a small
  diameter heavy saucepan allows using a minimum oil; a 5 or 6 inch pan
  with oil 1 1/2 inches deep and heated to 350"F will cook three hush
  puppies in about 2 1/2 minutes. When batter consistency is correct
  and oil is at 350"F, hush puppies will become firm, round shapes
  almost as soon as they enter the hot oil. If they are cooked in oil
  that is too hot, they will not cook in the center. Serving
  suggestions: Especially good served with fried catfish, trout,
  shrimp, oysters, chicken or chicken-fried steak. Source: Texas

      Title: Sam Arnold's Boneless Rump Roast
 Categories: Main dish, Beef
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      1 x  Boneless Rump Roast                 1 x  Wine; OR
      1 x  Salt                                1 x  Vinegar; OR
      1 x  Fresh Rosemary Needles              1 x  Lemon Juice
      1 x  Garlic Salt                         1 x  Beef Stock; OR
      1 x  Freshly Ground Black Pepper         1 x  Red Wine
      1 x  Beer; OR                            1 x  Minced Shallots
 
  NOTE:  This recipe is adjustable to all sizes of roasts. This is the
  Marinate the meat for a couple of hours in a liquid that is slightly
  acidic--a liquid such as wine, beer, vinegar, or lemon juice. Roast
  for 15 minutes per pound at 325 degrees F.  For the last 15 minutes,
  cook at 500 degrees F.  For example, for a 4 pound roast, total
  cooking time is 1 hour but it will be 45 minutes at 325 degrees F.
  and 15 minutes at 500 degrees F.  This will crust the outside of the
  roast and the inside will be medium, barely pink.
   This is based on room temperature meat.  If the meat is quite cold,
  extend the baking time.  After 3/4 of the cooking time, sprinkle with
  salt and some fresh or dry rosemary needles. Turn the roast with
  WOODEN SPOONS (Very important that you do not pierce the meat) and
  season it all over. Rosemary, seasoned salt or garlic salt are nice,
  and some freshly ground black pepper adds to the flavor also. Swab
  the roast with some fresh lemon juice--this will also add to the zing
  of the meat. When cooked, snip off the cords and slice to serve. From
  the roasting pan, spoon off the fat from the accumulated juice.  Add
  some beef stock or red wine to the juices, a few minced shallots or
  green onion shreds and cook down at high heat to a reduction or
  concentrated sauce. Adjust the seasonings, salt, pepper, and herbs of
  your choice, and serve with the roast.

      Title: Roasted Garlic
 Categories: Herbs/spice, Appetizer
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 x  Whole Heads Of Garlic               1 x  Softened Sweet Butter
      1 x  Toasted Rounds French Bread    
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Remove the papery outer covering of
  whole garlic head, but do not separate the cloves or peel them. Place
  as many whole heads of garlic on a large square of heavy-duty
  aluminum foil as there are people to be served. Fold up foil so that
  the cloves are completely wrapped. Bake in the preheated oven for 1
  hour 15 minutes. Serve each diner a head of garlic and some bread and
  butter. Separate cloves. Hold a clove over a piece of buttered bread
  and squeeze. The garlic puree will pop out, like toothpaste from a
  tube. Spread and eat. GARLIC PUREE: To make a batch of Garlic Puree
  for later use, let roasted heads of garlic cool, unwrapped for at
  least 5 minutes. Gently separate the cloves and squeeze each one over
  a fine meshed sieve, so that the softened garlic pops into the sieve.
  With wooden spatula or wooden spoon, rub garlic through the sieve
  into a small container or bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and
  refrigerate the puree if needed. QUICK PUREE: If you are in a hurry,
  you may skip the refinement of the sieve. Simply squeeze the cloves,
  one by one, over a bowl. When they have all been squeezed, use a
  rubber spatula to push the puree into a neat mound cover tightly with
  plastic wrap, and refrigerate until needed. It will keep for months.
  To keep indefinitely, cover with a film of olive oil.

      1 t  Salt                                1 x  Fat For Deep Frying; **
    1/3 c  Butter Or Regular Margarine         1 x  Jam Or Jelly
      1 tb Orange Juice                   
 
  *    Use up to 4 cups of Unbleached Flour in this recipe. ** Heat the
  fat to 375 degrees F. for frying the doughnuts. Soften the yeast in
  the warm water and let stand for 5 minutes or until it "blooms" or
  proofs. Put a half cup of sugar, the salt, butter, orange juice and
  rum extract in a large bowl.  Pour the scalded milk over the
  ingredients in the bowl.
   Stir until the butter is melted.  Cool to lukewarm.
   When cool, blend in 1 cup of the unbleached flour and beat until
  smooth. Stir in the yeast and add about half of the remaining flour,
  beating until smooth.
   Beat in the eggs.  Then beat in enough of the remaining flour to
  make a SOFT (should be slightly sticky and light in weight). Turn the
  dough out onto a lightly floured board and let rest for 5 to 10
  minutes. Knead until smooth and elastic (about 8 to 10 minutes). Form
  into a ball and put into a greased bowl, turning to grease the top of
  the ball of dough.
   Cover and let rise in a warm draft free place until doubled in bulk.
  Punch the dough down, kneading lightly to remove all of the air
  pockets, and turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll
  to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut the dough into rounds using a 3-inch
  biscuit or cookie cutter. Cover with waxed paper and let rise on the
  rolling surface away from drafts and direct heat, until double in
  bulk, (30 to 45 minutes). About 20 minutes before frying, heat the
  fat. Fry the doughnuts in the heated fat. Put only as many doughnuts
  at one time as will float uncrowded in a single layer deep in the
  fat.  Fry 2 to 3 minutes or until lightly browned; turn the doughnuts
  with a fork or tongs, being careful not to pierce the doughnut, when
  they rise to the surface. Do this several times during the cooking.
  Lift from the fat, draining for a few seconds over the fat before
  removing to absorbent paper toweling. Cool.  Cut a slit through the
  center in the side of each doughnut.
   Force about 1/2 ts of jam or jelly into the center and press lightly
  to close the slit.  (A pastry bag and tube may be used to force the
  jelly or jam into the slit.) Shake 2 or 3 bismarks at one time in a
  bag containing granulated or powdered sugar.  (Your choice.) Shake
  lightly to remove the excess sugar.

      Title: Basic Divinity
 Categories: Candy
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 c  White Sugar; Granulated             1 t  Vanilla Extract
    1/2 c  Light Corn Syrup                    1 c  Nuts; Chopped, OR

      2 ea Egg Whites; Lg                 
 
  ~------------------------------OPTIONALS
  ~-------------------------------- NOTE:  TO PREWARM A CANDY
  THERMOMETER, SIMPLE PLACE IT AN A SMALL SAUCE PAN OF COLD WATER AND
  BRING IT TO A BOIL.  LET IT SIMMER UNTIL YOU NEED THE THERMOMETER.
  STEP 1: Prewarm the thermometer; separate the eggs allowing the
  whites to come to room temperature in a large bowl of an electric
  mixer.  (Return the egg yolks to the refrigerator covering with
  plastic wrap or water for another recipe.) Fill a glass with ice
  cubes and water. To make dropped divinities, you will need 2 cookie
  sheets, topped with greased wax paper. For squares, use a greased and
  wax paper-lined 8 X 8-inch pan.  Measure the sugar, corn syrup, ice
  water and salt and dump into a heavy 2-quart saucepan with a tight
  fitting lid. STEP 2: Dissolve the sugar, stirring constantly with a
  wooden spoon over low heat.
   Syrup will become clear, gritty sounds will cease, and the spoon will
  glide smoothly over the bottom of the pan. Increase the heat to
  medium and bring to a boil. STEP 3: (OPTIONAL): Cover pan with a
  square of wax paper and lid, pushing down firmly.  Steam for 2 to 3
  minutes to dissolve the sugar crystals.  (Listen to make sure the pot
  doesn't boil over. To double-check, remove lid, leaving the wax paper
  in place.) STEP 4: Wash down any crystals clinging to the sides with
  a brush dipped in hot water from the thermometer bath. Introduce the
  prewarmed thermometer. No need to stir. STEP 5:  Beat the egg whites
  until stiff but not dry. If your mixer is a heavy duty one, you can
  wait until the bubbles in the syrup become very large and airy before
  beating the egg whites. Otherwise, do it now when the thermometer
  registers 240 Degrees F. (115.5 C.). STEP 6: Test the syrup when the
  thermometer registers 246 degrees F. (119 C.). Continue testing until
  it reach the firm-ball stage, 246 to 260 degrees F. (119 to 126.5
  C.). Syrup will be hard to scrape up in ice water.
   It will have to be forced into a ball, but once formed, it should
  hold its shape but give under pressure. Return the thermometer to the
  hot water bath to soak clean. STEP 7:  Dribble the syrup into the egg
  whites in a slow, steady stream, beating at slow speed. Tilt the
  syrup pan to get the last drop but do not scrape the pan. Once the
  syrup is completely incorporated, change to a flat whip if you have
  one. STEP 8: Have patience and continue beating.
   The amount of time you spend mixing depends on the power of your
  mixer. If you have a heavy duty or commercial one, you can go to full
  speed and make the divinity in less than 5 minutes. With less
  powerful ones, it can take up to 20 minutes. The important thing is
  to beat at the highest speed of your mixer.
   Also if it is a hot and humid day, it will take longer also. STEP 9:
  Test the divinity.  The first and most important test occurs when you
  lift the beaters.  If the candy falls back in ribbons that
  immediately merge back into the batter, it isn't done.
   Eventually, a stationary column will form between the beaters and the
  bowl.  Candy will lose its sheen/gloss and stop being sticky; a
  teaspoonful dropped onto wax paper will hold its shape, even a peak.
  If you machine is laboring and the candy is not quite there yet, you
  have two choices: Pour anyway and put into a frost free freezer to
  set up....or finish by hand. STEP 10:  Fold in the flavorings and
  nuts and/or other optional items using the mixer or if very thick, a
  wooden spoon. STEP 11: Drop or spread the divinity either on wax
  paper-covered cookie sheets or the buttered pan. Dripping it by
  teaspoon is harder work for you but it ripens quicker and is ready to
  eat sooner. A neat trick is to put the candy into a pastry bag and
  pipe onto the wax paper.  If you spread it in the pan, you will have
  to wait up to 24 hours before it is ready. But you maybe one of those
  that think it is better when it is 24 hours old.  Score and cut into
  squares. Store in an airtight container at room temperature or in a
  refrigerator. Makes 1 pound but looks like more. Recipe CANNOT be
  doubled; it can be frozen but not for extended periods of time.

    1/2 c  Butter, softened                   12 oz Whipped topping,1 tub thawed
 
  This is a joke, a bit of whimsy to lighten up your next party. The
  cake is really a quick mix dessert made with Oreo cookies and soft
  squishy stuff. The trick is to capture everyone's attention with an
  announcement of some sort, and as you are speaking, trowel out some
  of the dirt from the flower pot around the flowers and eat it. May be
  followed by a worm dug out of the "dirt". You may substitute vanilla
  pudding for the chocolate if you want, and use up to 20 oz of Oreos.
  Please use a clean new plastic flower pot or take the precaution of
  lining a clay pot with foil and wrap the stems of live flowers if you
  use them in order to prevent any toxins from entering the dessert.
    Crush the cookies until they resemble potting soil.
   Set aside.   Cream the butter or margarine, cream cheese, sugar and
  vanilla until smooth and fluffy.
   Set aside.  Combine the pudding mix and milk until well blended.
  Then fold in the whipped topping.
   Gently fold the cream cheese and pudding mixtures together. To put
  the "cake" together, layer one-third of the cookie crumbs followed by
  1/2 of the pudding mixture, 1/3 of the crumbs, the rest of the
  pudding mixture and topping with the balance of the crumbs.
  Refrigerate 10-12 hours before serving.
   Remove from refrigerator, decorate with flowers.
   Serve by digging out portions with the trowel.
   Serves 10 to 12.

  is tender and vegetables are cooked -- about two hours. Strain and
  refrigerate. Remove the fat that congeals on top and discard. Serve
  soup with noodles or rice, cooked separately or in the strained
  broth. Microwave method: Gilletz prefers this method, because all the
  ingredients and can be added at once and there is no need to skim the
  broth. In a bowl, pour boiling water over chicken. Trim off excess
  fat. Place chicken in a five-quart microwave-safe casserole. Cut
  carrots and celery into chunks. Add to chicken along with onion, dill
  and seasonings. cover with water. To prevent boiling over, take care
  water remains 1 1/2 inches below top of the casserole. Cover
  casserole and microwave at high (100 %) power for 30 - 35 minutes or
  until soup is boiling. Stir. Simmer at medium power for 25 - 30
  minutes. Let stand covered for 15 - 20 minutes. Strain soup. Serve as
  above. From The Gazette, 91/01/16.

      2 ea Cloves garlic finely chopped   
 
    Serves 6 to 8.
    1.  There is a small membrane, known as an operculum, at the

  it will come off easily.   2.  Place the snails in a basin and rinse
  thoroughly with cold water.  Drain and rinse once more in cold water
  that contains a generous amount of salt.
   Rinse once more in cold water before cooking.
    3.  Add four quarts of cold water to a kettle and add the snails and
  about three tablespoons salt.
   Bring slowly to a boil and simmer six minutes, stirring
  occasionally. 4. Meanwhile, place the garlic and one teaspoon of salt
  in a small, heavy bowl.  Crush the garlic with a pestle or the back
  of a heavy spoon to make a paste.  Add the oil, pepper (to taste),
  lemon juice, and six tablespoons cold water.
   Stir with a whisk to blend.   5.  Drain the snails and serve hot
  with the sauce cold.   Note:  To eat the snails, pull out the meat
  with a pick and dip them one at a time in the sauce. The whole snail
  may be eaten, although the most fastidious prefer to skip the soft
  after end of the meat, which is the digestive tract.

  juice, used mainly for cooking fish and shellfish, but also sometimes
  white offal (variety meats) and some white meats. -- mkm] Chop them,
  together with the peeled shallots and a small bunch of well-washed
  chives.
   Place these ingredients in a saucepan with the wine, cover and
  simmer for 1 hour. Meanwhile, soak the frogs' legs in the milk for 1
  hour. Drain them, then roll in flour and saute in the butter in a
  frying pan over a brisk heat for 10 minutes.  Add the snails,
  together with their cooking juices, and season with salt and pepper.
  [Personally, I prefer to mill the pepper at the dinner table.  The
  smell of the freshly ground pepper would otherwise be lost.  -- mkm]

      Title: Brown Sugar Fudge (Penuche)
 Categories: Candy
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 c  White Sugar; Granulated             2 oz Unsweetened Chocolate; 2 Sqs
      1 c  Light Brown Sugar; Firm Pack        4 tb Butter; 1/2 stick
    1/2 c  Heavy (Whipping) Cream          1 1/2 t  Vanilla
      3 tb Molasses; *                       1/2 c  Chopped Nuts; Optional
 
  *    This is to taste.  The original recipe called for 4 Tbls of
  Molasses, STEP 1:  PREPARE: Prewarm the thermometer in hot water; use
  a 2-quart saucepan; butter the upper sides (inside) of the saucepan;
  measure all ingredients except the vanilla and optionals, and dump
  into the saucepan. Grease and if necessary, line a 5 X 10-inch pan.
  Fill glass with ice cubes and water and the sink with 1/2 inch of
  cold water. STEP 2: Dissolve the sugar, stirring constantly with a
  wooden spoon, over low heat until the butter melts, the gritty sounds
  cease, and the spoon glides smoothly over the bottom of the pan.
  Increase the heat to medium and bring to a boil. STEP 3: Boil, after
  washing down any crystals that may have formed, with a pastry brush
  dipped in hot water from the thermometer bath, using as little water
  as possible. Introduce the prewarmed thermometer.
   Reduce the heat while keeping the fudge at a boil.
   Stir no more than necessary. STEP 4: Test the fudge mixture in the
  ice-cold water when the mixture thickens and bubbles become noisy.
  Ball, formed in ice water, should hold its shape until the heat from
  your had begins to flatten it and should be al dente -- slightly
  chewy -- between 230 and 240 (110 and 115.5 degrees C.). Because of
  the molasses and brown sugar, it can ball at a lower temperature than
  some other fudges. STEP 5: Shock by placing the saucepan in the cold
  water in the sink. STEP 6: Seed by adding, without stirring, the
  vanilla.  Then allow to cool. STEP 7: Stir when luke warm and "skin"
  forms on the top (110 degrees F.(43.5 degrees C.)).  Return the
  thermometer to its hot water bath to soak clean. Stir the fudge
  thoroughly but not vigorously by hand, with an electric mixer, or
  with a food processor.  Pause frequently to allow the fudge to react.
  STEP 8: Watch for the fudge to thicken, lose its sheen, and become
  lighter in color or streaked with lighter shade, give off some heat,
  suddenly stiffen. If mixing by had, the fudge will "snap" with each
  stroke; by mixer, mixer waves will become very distinct, by food
  processor, fudge will flow sluggishly back to the center when the
  processor is stopped. STEP 9: Add the optionals (1/2 Cup Chopped Nuts
  (walnuts, pecans, or hazelnuts (filberts)) before the fudge totally
  candies. STEP 10: Pour, score, and store when cool in an airtight
  container in the refrigerator or at room temperature. YIELD: 1 pound
  of fudge. Recipe is easily doubled and can be frozen. VARIATIONS:
  HONEY BROWN SUGAR FUDGE: In Step 1, eleminate the unsweetened
  chocolate and replace the molasses with 1/4 cup of honey. The honey
  causes the fudge to ball at a higher temperature. CHOCOLATE HONEY
  BROWN SUGAR FUDGE: In Step 1, replace the heavy cream with light
  cream or evaporated milk and replace the molasses with 1/4 cup of
  honey. ORANGE BROWN SUGAR FUDGE:  In Step 1, eleminate molasses,
  chocolate but add 1 Tbl corn syrup.  In Step 6, add 1 Tbl grated
  orange zest, plus if you can get it, 1 tsp of pure orange extract.
  PEANUT BUTTER BROWN SUGAR FUDGE: In Step 1, eliminate the molasses
  and chocolate, replace the heavy cream with 1/4 cup of milk and 1/4
  cup of creamy peanut butter. To intensify the peanut butter flavor,
  add 1/3 of a cup of salted peanuts in Step 9. PRALINE BROWN SUGAR
  FUDGE: In Step 1, eliminating the molasses is optional -- you'ss get
  a more Southern praline with it, a milder one without it--or
  compromise and use only 1 Tbls. Eliminate the chocolate. In Step 3,
  when the mixture begins to thicken, add 1 1/2 cups of pecan halves
  slowly so as not to break the boil or cool the mixture too quickly.

      1 lb Fresh Calves' Liver                 1 ea Egg, hard-cooked, mashed
      2 tb Salad Oil                           1 x  Salt
      3 tb Butter                              1 x  Freshly Ground Pepper
      1 ea Large Spanish Onion, chopped   
 
  With a sharp knife, remove the tough outer membranes from liver. In a
  heavy skillet, heat oil and add chopped onions. Cook over medium high
  heat until translucent and golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon
  and set aside. Add butter to skillet. Heat until melted. Add liver
  pieces. Over medium heat, fry liver until just done - 3 minutes on
  each side. Alternatively, liver can be brushed with butter and
  broiled. To test for doneness, cut a piece from liver slice. If still
  pink, continue cooking for 30 - 60 seconds. Overcooking causes the
  liver to be dry and tough. For finely mashed egg that disappears in
  the liver mixture, force egg through a wire strainer. For best
  results, separate the hard cooked whites from yolks and sieve them
  separately. Set aside. Fit meat grinder with a medium blade and place
  cooked liver and cooked onions in the grinder. Grind, then regrind
  the ground mixture. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the twice ground
  meat and onions mixture with the sieved eggs. Add salt and pepper.
  Taste and adjust seasoning. If desired, add a few drops of commercial
  gravy browning liquid to heighten color. Refrigerate for 24 hours
  before serving. Serve with slices of tomato, cucumber and dark rye
  bread. Serves 4. By Sur Le Gril's chef Claude Dubourg. From The

  Pound the chicken breasts to 1/4 inch thickness. Reserve 8 perfect
  mango slices for garnish. In a blender or food processor, whirl
  mangoes (including syrup) with orange juice, garlic and salt. Set
  aside. Heat oil in saute pan. When hot, dip chicken breasts in
  seasoned flour -- be careful to shake off excess flour -- and place
  them in the hot pan. Saute chicken, for approximately 2 minutes per
  side. Add butter and mango puree to the pan. Cook until the sauce is
  reduced and fairly thick -- about 2 minutes. With a spatula, remove
  the mango-covered chicken breasts from the pan and place them on a
  hot platter. Spoon remaining mango puree over the chicken. Sprinkle
  with toasted almonds. Garnish each breast with 2 mango slices. For a
  more pronounced mango flavour, use fresh mangoes. Use 2 fresh mangoes
  and 1/2 cup of orange juice. Boil for 1 minute. From owner-chef Barry
  Pall of Pappacito's, a fast-food restaurant in the Bell Canada Tower
  ind downtown Montreal. He refused to identify the spices in the
  seasoned flour but will admit that there are 2 teaspoons of powdered
  chicken soup per cup of flour. From The Gazette, 91/02/20.

  Form dough into marble-sized balls. Place 2 inches apart on greased
  cookie sheet. Flatten each with smooth bottom of a drinking glass
  greased once and dipped into Nestles' Quick Powder. (Or use sweetened
  chocolate drink powder). Bake at 400 degrees for 8 minutes.  Remove
  cookies at once from baking sheet, to paper toweling and at once,
  flatten each cookie with back of pancake turner.  Let cool 20
  minutes.  Fill with COOKIE FILLING mixture. (Cookie Filling) Soften
  gelatin in cold water. Place in heatproof cup in pan of hot water
  till gelatin is transparent.
   Meanwhile beat Crisco till fluffy, adding vanilla and sugar a little
  at a time.  Beat in Gelatin mixture when it is completely cooled, but
  not yet "set" or firm. This is used to give the filling stability -
  as well as protein!  When cooled, shape filling into 1 inch balls.
  Place between the two bottom sides of the cooled cookies, pressing
  gently till filling has spread to edge of cookies and rounded-out
  like the originals. This is suppose to be a great imitation version
  of the original Nabisco Oreos.

      Yield: 48 servings
 
      2 c  Cornmeal                          1/2 t  Soda
      1 c  Plain flour                       1/2 c  Parsley, finely chopped
      1 t  Baking powder                       1 x  Deep fat for frying
      1 t  Salt                           
 
  Combine all dry ingredients.  Add eggs, buttermilk, onions, and oil or
  bacon drippings.  Mix well.  Drop in deep hot fat by spoonfuls and
  brown on all sides. Now, I said above that this makes 48, I've never
  counted, so I don't know for sure.  But it sure does make a bunch.
  The main reason why I said 48 is because the program, MenuMaster,
  won't let you past that field unless you tell it something. Justin
  Wilson says, "Hush puppy is an old Southern term that originated
  after the Civil War. People didn't have enough for themselves to eat
  let alone feed their dogs, so when the old hounds started barking
  from hunger, they would throw pieces of fried corn bread to them,
  yelling, 'Shut up, dog! Hush puppy!"

      Title: True Garlic Bread
 Categories: Bread, Herbs/spice
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 x  Garlic Puree(2 Roasted Head)        2 T  Kosher Salt
    1/4 lb Unsalted Butter, Softened       3 1/4 c  Whole Wheat Flour
      2 T  (2 pk) Dry yeast                3 1/4 c  Unbleached All Purpose Flour
    1/2 c  Warm Water (115-120 degrees)        1 x  Cornmeal
  2 1/2 c  Warm Water                     
 
  Cream together the garlic puree and butter.  (This may be done days in
  advance and refrigerated.  Bring to room temperature before using).
  Combine the yeast with 1/2 cup warm water in large bowl. Stir with a
  fork or small whisk.  Add an additional 2 1/2 cups water.  Add salt.
  Stir in the flour, 1 c at a time, beginning with the whole wheat. Use
  a whisk until the dough becomes stiff, then switch to a wooden spoon.
  Turn the dough onto a well floured work surface.  Knead rhythmically
  for 10 to 15 minutes, until the dough is smooth, springy, nonsticky,
  and elastic. Add more flour as you knead if necessary.  The dough is
  ready if you can poke to fingers into it and the resulting
  indentations spring back. Cover the dough with a cloth and let rest
  while you wash, dry and generously butter the bowl. Knead the dough a
  few more turns, then form it into a ball and place it in the bowl.
   Turn it to coat with butter.  Cover the bowl and put it in a warm,
  draft-free place until the dough has doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2
  hours. It has risen sufficiently when you can gently poke a finger
  into the dough and the hole reamins.  (Don't poke too
  enthusiastically or the dough will collapse.)  When doubled, flour
  your fist and punch the dough down.
   Knead it a few times and then let it rest. Sprinkle 1 large or 2
  small baking sheets with a liberal amount of cornmeal. Divide the
  dough into 3 equal parts.
   While you work with 1 piece, keep the other 2 covered. Flour your
  work surface.  With a rolling pin, roll each piece of dough into a
  rectangle approximately 14-inches long X 7-inches wide.  Spread it
  with softened garlic butter.  Roll the long edge toward the opposite
  long edge, as if you were rolling up a rug. Pinch ends closed. Place
  loves on the baking sheets. With a sharp knife or razor blade, slash
  the loves lightly at 2-inch intervals.  Cover with a cloth and place
  in a warm draft-free place to rise until doubled, about 1/2 hour.
  Meanwhile preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes
  with a pan of boiling water on the oven floor. Spray loaves with
  water several times during the baking process. (This helps the bread
  form a thick crusty shell.) To test for doneness, rap the loaf with
  your knuckles. The loaf should sound hollow. Cool on wire racks, but
  the loaves are delicious eaten warm right out of the oven.

     40 lb Live crawfish                     1/2 c  Ground black pepper
      1 c  Salt                                5 lb Small white onions
    1/2 c  Ground white pepper                12 ea Ears of corn, shucked

    1/2 c  Ground white pepper               1/2 c  Ground black pepper
    1/2 c  Ground red pepper                   2 c  Salt
 
  Alex Patout describes Crawfish as "a delicacy made for sharing-- in
  fact, in Cajun country, boiling crawfish for only two people counts
  as a venial sin." Wash the crawfish well and pick out any fish bones
  or other debris. Fill a great big (40-quart) Stockpot a quarter full
  of water. Add the salt and peppers and bring to boil. Add the whole
  onions, the corn, and the new potatoes (it will be easy to remove
  them later if you put them in a cloth sack).  Return to boil, cover,
  lower heat to medium, and let cook for 8 minutes.  Add crawfish,
  cover again and raise heat to high. After steam begins to escape from
  under the lid, cook 7 minutes more. Remove from heat and let sit for
  4 minutes. Do *NOT* remove the lid until this point! Remove the
  onions, corn, and potatoes to a bowl and drain the crawfish. Place
  the crawfish in a large insulated container (an ce chest works well,
  as do the thick waterproof boxes chickens are shipped in, which your
  butcher may give you for free).  Have your *SPRINKLE* ready and
  sprinkle over the crawfish and mix them well to coat. Cover and let
  sit for 7 minutes. Serve immediately with the onions, corn, new
  potatoes, and lots of French bread on a large table covered with
  plenty of paper. When everyone has eaten his fill, everyone "peels
  for the house."  The peeled tails can then be used in cold crawfish
  cocktail or salad or for Fried Crawfish the next day. Serves 8-10
  NOTE:  Most of the salt is not added until after the cooking process
  because too much salt added during cooking makes the flesh of the
  crawfish adhere to the shell. From Alex Patout's "Cajun Home Cooking"

      1 t  Ground red pepper              
 
  Peel and devein the shrimp.  Place heads (if you have them), and
  peels in a small saucepan and add the water. Bring to a slow boil
  over medium-high heat and let boil slowly for 15-20 minutes. Strain
  and discard the heads and peels.    Place the oil in a Dutch oven or
  other large, heavy pot and place over medium-high heat. Add the
  onions, peppers, and celery and saute stirring often, until the
  vegetables are very soft, about 45 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes,
  salt, peppers, herbs, sugar, and shrimp stock and return to simmer.
   Reduce heat to medium and let simmer for 2 hours, stirring
  occasionally, This is your creole sauce; it can be prepared 1 or 2
  days in advance and stored in the refrigerator (I find the sauce is
  even better after sitting a couple of days in the refrigerator).
     When you are ready to serve, return the sauce to a simmer and add
  the shrimp.  Cook until they turn pink, 5-7 minutes. Stir in the
  green onions and parsley and let cook for 1 minute more. Serve on
  flat plates over beds of rice.    Serves 6-8. SHRIMP AND HAM OR TASSO
  JAMBALAYA: Prepare Shrimp Creole as above, but add about a pound of
  cubed ham and a 4-ounce can of tomatoe sauce to the finished sauce
  and simmer 45 minutes more. Meanwhile, boil or steam 2-3 cups raw
  rice. Finish the sauce (which will be your jambalaya base) by adding
  the shrimp, green onions, and parsley as above. (If you are using
  leftover Shrimp Creole, remove the shrimp and reheat the sauce, add
  the ham and tomato sauce, and proceed as above. Return the shrimp to
  the pan at the end of cooking.) Place the hot, cooked rice in a large
  bowl, pour the jambalaya base over, mix well, and serve. You can also
  prepare this dish with sausage instead of ham. From Alex Patout's

      1 x  Oil for frying (optional)         1/2 c  Melted butter
 
  Cut the chicken wings in two at the joints.  In a large frying pan or
  skillet; heat to 360F enough oil (or shortening) to cover the chicken
  wings.  Add the wings and fry until crisp, about 12-15 minutes.
     To bake, preheat the oven to 450F.  Spread the chicken wings out
  on a baking sheet in one layer and bake 45 minutes. To make the
  sauce, combine the Hot Sauce or Tabasco and melted butter and blend
  thoroughly. As soon as the chicken wings are cooked, douse with the
  sauce, and serve immediately. Serves 2-6 Nathalie Dupree's "New
  Southern Cooking" Nathalie says, "These little wings make a good meal
  for two or are a great appetizer. Up North, they are called Buffalo
  wings and are served with celery and blue-cheese dressing.  The
  little wing tips should be trimmed off to make neater pieces.  But I
  cook them along with the wings and save them for myself. I call them
  the "cook's treat." You may fry or bake the wings, depending on
  dietary considerations.

 Categories: Cajun/creol, Main dish
      Yield: 8 servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------SEASONING MIX----------------------------
      2 t  Salt                                1 t  Dry mustard
  1 1/2 t  White pepper                        1 t  Ground cayenne pepper
      1 t  Garlic powder                     1/2 t  Black pepper

MMMMM----------------------RICE INGREDIENTS---------------------------
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil                       4 T  Unsalted butter
      1 c  Chopped onions                  1 1/2 c  Uncooked rice (converted)
      1 c  Chopped green bell peppers          3 c  Pork, beef or chicken stock
    1/2 c  Pecan halves, dry roasted           2 c  Chopped unpeeled apples
    1/2 c  Raisins                        
 
  Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
  In a 2-quart saucepan, heat the oil over high heat until very hot,
  about 2 minutes.  Add the onions and bell peppers; saute about 2
  minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the pecans (we ran out of
  pecans, so Lucy substituted hickory nuts - good!) and continue
  cooking for about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the raisins
  and butter (these are added together so the raisins will absorb as
  much butter as possible). Stir until butter is melted, then cook
  until raisins are plump, about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add
  the rice and seasoning mix and cook until rice starts looking frizzly
  (a bit like ce Krispies) Chef Prudhomme recommended using converted
  rice.  Lucy used brown, long grain rice - super!. This will require
  about 2 to 3 minutes, stirring almost constantly before the rice
  looks "frizzly". Stir in the stock, scraping pan bottom well, then
  stir in the apples. Cover pan and bring to boil; lower heat and
  simmer covered for 5 minutes.
   Remove from heat and let sit, *COVERED*, until rice is tender and
  stock is absorbed, about 30 minutes.
   (We cook the rice this slow way to let the flavors build to their
  maximum.)   Serve immediately, allowing about 3/4 cup per person.

      2 t  Minced garlic                       2 c  Green onions,chopped vy fine
  3 1/4 c  RICH chicken stock (see note  

MMMMM-------------------CHICKEN SEASONING MIX------------------------
  1 1/2 T  Salt                                1 t  Black pepper
  1 1/2 t  White pepper                        1 t  Cumin (optional)
  1 1/2 t  Garlic powder                     1/2 t  Dried sweet basil leaves
  1 1/4 t  Ground cayenne pepper               2 lb Boneless chicken (see notes)
 
  NOTE:  To make a Rich Chicken Stock strain the basic stock, then
  continue simmering it until evaporation reduces the liquid by half.
  For example, if the recipe calls for 1 cup Rich Stock, start it with
  at least 2 cups of strained basic stock. dark meat, cut into 1/2-inch
  cubes. Directions: Place in the hot water, oil and salt in a large
  pot over high heat; and cover and bring to a boil.  When water
  reaches a rolling boil, add small amounts of spaghetti at a time to
  the pot, breaking up oil patches as you drop the spaghetti in.
  Return to boiling and cook to al dente stage, do not over cook.(To
  test doneness of spaghetti, cut a strand in half near the end of
  cooking time.  When done, there should be only a speck of white in
  the center, less than one-fourth the diameter of the strand.) Do not
  overcook. During this cooking time, use a wooden or spaghetti spoon
  to lift spaghetti out of the water by spoonfuls and shake strands
  back into the boiling water.  (It may be an old wives' tale, but this
  procedure seems to enhance the spaghetti's texture.)
   Then immediately drain spaghetti into a collander; stop cooking
  process by running cold water over strands. (If you used dry
  spaghetti, first rinse with hot water to wash off starch.) After the
  pasta has cooled thoroughly, about 2 to 3 minutes, pour a liberal
  amount of vegetable oil in your hands and toss spaghetti. Set aside
  still in the colander.
      Meanwhile, thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a
  small bowl and set aside.
      In a 4-quart saucepan, combine 1-1/2 sticks of the butter, the
  onions and garlic cloves; saute over medium heat 5 minutes, stirring
  occasionally. Add the minced garlic and seasoning mix; continue
  cooking over medium heat until onions are dark brown, but not burned,
  about 8 to 10 minutes, stirring often.  Add 2-1/2 cups of the stock,
  the Worcestershire and Tabasco; bring to a fast simmer and cook about
  8 minutes, stirring often. Stir in the tomato sauce and bring mixture
  to a boil. Then stir in the sugar and 1 cup of the green onions;
  gently simmer uncovered about 40 nminutes, stirring occasionally.
     Heat the serving plates in a 250F oven.     Combine the
  ingredients of the chicken seasoning mix in a small bowl; mix well.
  Sprinkle over the chicken, rubbing it in with your hands. In a large
  skillet melt 1-1/2 sticks of the butter over medium heat. Add the
  remaining 1 cup green onions and saute over high heat about 3
  minutes. Add the chicken and continue cooking 10 minutes, stirring
  frequently. When the tomato sauce has simmered about 40 minutes, stir
  in the chicken mixture and heat through.
      To finish the dish, for each serving melt 2 tablespoons butter in
  a large skillet over medium heat. Add one-sixth of the cooked
  spaghetti (a bit less than a 2 cup measure); heat spaghetti 1 minute,
  stirring constantly.  Add 1-1/4 cups chicken and sauce and 2
  tablespoons of remaining stock; heat throughly, stirring frequently.
  Remove from heat. Roll spaghetti on a large fork and lift onto a
  heated serving plate. Repeat process for remaining servings. From

  into the flour, together with the eggs and use enough of the water to
  give a firm, yet elastic dough. Knead well, leave to rise and knock
  back;  blend in the drained fruit and knead again. Shape the dough
  into loaves and set into greased 1 lb tins in a warm place to prove;
  bake, reducing the temperature after the first 15 minutes.

  addition. Beat in vanilla. Add dry ingredients alternately with water
  to creamed mixture, beating well after each addition.  Stir in
  sauerkraut.  Spread batter in greased 13 x 9 x 2-inch bakeing pan.
  Bake in a preheated 350 degree F. oven for 35 minutes or until cake
  tests done. Cool in pan on rack. Frost with Creamy Chocolate
  Frosting.  Cut into squares. CREAMY CHOCOLATE FROSTING: Melt
  chocolate in a custard cup in hot water.  Cool slightly. Combine
  chocolate, cream cheese, milk, confectioners' sugar, salt, and
  vanilla in a bowl.
   Beat with an electric mixer at high speed until smooth and creamy.
  NOTE: This is one of those dishes that sound absolutely horrible, but
  tastes great.  It is also one of those recipes that is a classic but
  you can never find in most cookbooks. I have fooled my kids with this
  as well as seen it done on TV.  Everyone thinks that the sauerkraut
  is coconut. So be sure to rinse and drain the sauerkraut several
  times when you make this recipe.

      1 t  Salt                                4 oz Baking Chocolate
    1/4 c  Vegetable Shorteneing         

MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
    1/3 c  Butter Or Regular Margarine       1/2 c  Sour Cream
      3 c  Confectioners' sugar                3 oz Baking Chocolate
 
  Sift togetehr the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt
  into a large mixing bowl.  Add shortening, sour cream, vanilla, eggs,
  water and chocolate (melted then cooled).  Beat with an electric
  mixer at low speed, scraping bowl constantly, for 1/2 minute.
  Increase speed to high and beat an additional 3 minutes, scraping
  bowl occasionally. Pour batter into 2 greased and waxed-paper lined
  9-inch round cake pans. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F. Oven for 35
  minutes or until cake tests done. Cool in pans on racks for 10
  minutes.  Remove from pans and cool completely on the racks. Place
  one cake layer on serving plate. Spread with Sour Cream / Chocolate
  Frosting.  Top with second cake layer.  Frost sides and top of the
  cake with the remaining Sour Cream/Chocolate Frosting. SOUR
  CREAM/CHOCOLATE FROSTING: Combine the softened butter or margarine,
  confectioners' sugar, and sour cream in a mixing bowl; blend well.
  Add chocolate which has been melted and cooled and vanilla. Beat
  until smooth. NOTE: I have seen reference to people having trouble
  with their layer cakes and how they rise.  Try this little trick when
  making this cake. Take the layer that has the least amount of rise on
  the top and trim it to be flat with a sharp knife.  Place the trimmed
  side down (layer should be upside down). Then frost between layers
  and place the other layer on right side up and finished frosting.  It
  will give the illusion of having a cake with only one domed layer and
  will sit better on your cake plate. Also the trimmings are great
  eating just plain for the cook or for the kids.

   This is an excellent source of protein, carbohydrates, and (cooked in
  butter or oil), fat.
   Beat the egg, milk,vanilla, and cinnamon together in a flat dish
  such as a soup plate or pie pan, that will accomodate the bread and
  make it easy to remove the bread once it's wet. Add 1 slice of bread
  at a time, turning so that both sides are coated and absorb some of
  the liquid. Remove the bread, slice by slice, to a plate. Heat butter
  or oil on a large griddle or skillet, reduce the heat, and brown the
  bread briefly on each side. Serve with syrup, honey, cooked or raw
  fruit, or plain.

  2 T of the oil) together and add them to the dry mixture. Stir to mix
  well, mashing out the lumps with a wooden spoon. Add more liquid if
  necessary; the batter should pour off the spoon slowly but smoothly.
  You can use water instead of milk after you've added the first 1 1/2
  cups of milk. Brush a hot skillet with oil or butter. The skillet
  should be well greased. Heat the skillet and cook the pancakes on the
  1st side over med-hi heat until the surface bubbles; turn and cook

   Use a semi-thawed frankfurter, which is easier to cut. With a knife,
  make a straight horizontal slit aboyt 1" from the top. On both sides
  of the frank, make a slit upward so the franks looks like it has 2
  arms. From the bottom of the frank, make a 1" slit upwards, to make 2
  legs. Broil in the oven. As the frank cooks, the "arms" and "legs"
  will curl out a bit, making it look more like a person.  When done,
  remove from oven and decorate with mustard or ketchup. Put on eyes, a
  mouth, buttons, perhaps shoes, etc. Kids love this, especially if

  want to add fish or chicken or perhaps just a salad. Preheat the oven
  to 350 deg F. Carefully spoon the potato out of the skin; save the
  skins. Mash the potatoes with butter until fluffy, then add the milk
  and mash smooth. Mix in the cheese, salt, and broccoli and scoop the
  mixture back into potato skins. Bake in a shallow pan for 10 min or

      Title: Strawberry Shortcake
 Categories: Fruit, Cake/cookie
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    3/4 c  Whole Wheat Flour                 1/3 c  Plus 3T Brown Sugar (packed)
    3/4 c  Unbleached White Flour              2 T  Butter, melted
  1 1/2 t  Baking Powder                     3/4 c  Low-fat Milk
    1/2 t  Salt                                1 pt Strawberries     *
 
  * Sweet, ripe strawberries, hulled and crushed Heavy Cream (optional)
  ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' '' Preheat
  oven to 400 deg F.
   In a mixing bowl, sift together the flours, baking powder, and salt.
  In another bowl, combine 1/3 cup of the sugar with the melted butter
  until it dissolves. Stir in the milk, then combine the wet with the
  dry ingredients and work together to form a soft dough. Turn the
  dough out onto a well-floured board and knead for a minute or so.
  Divide the dough into 2 equal parts, form into smooth balls, and roll
  out to to fit the bottom of a pie pan. Place the rounds of dough in 2
  lightly oiled pie pans. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until dough is
  golden brown. In the meantime, combine the crushed strawberries with
  the remaining 3 T sugar in a small bowl. Cover until ready to use.
  Allow the baked dough to cool until it is just warm to the touch.
  Place 1 round on a serving plate, spread it with the berries, and top
  with the other round of dough. Cut into wedges to serve; this is best
  served fresh and warm. Top each serving with a bit of cold, stiffly
  beaten heavy cream if you'd like.

   Place blachan in a non-stick pan and heat gently fro 3 to 4 minutes
  to develop the flavors.  Pell and cut red onions into wedges. Combine
  oyster, soy and chili sauces with blachan; stir into remaining
  tamarind liquid. Heat a large wok over high heat.  When a drop of
  water sizzles immediately into steam pour in 2 tablespoons of the
  oil. Swirl up sides of wok, and when just at smoking point, dump in
  ginger and garlic.
   Stir fry until golden, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Adding more oil as
  needed, stir frey shrimp in batches until orange red, about 3
  minutes. Pour sauces over all the shrimp in the wok and cook at a
  brisk bubble over high heat until shrimps are aromatic and sauces
  have reduced and thickened to enrobe the shells, about 8 minutes. Mix
  in sugar and onion wedges, taste to adjust seasoning, sweetening and
  spiciness.  Makes plenty for 6 as a principal dish with rice, enough
  for 8 with other dishes.

  CAKE:  Butter and flour the bottom and sides of a 9 inch spring form
  pan; set aside.  In a large bowl beat whites and cream of tartar to
  soft peaks. Gradually beat in 1/4 cup of the sugar, continuing to
  beat to stiff peaks. In a separate bowl beat the yolks with remaining
  sugar until light yellow and thickened.
   Scrape yolks over whites, add lemon rind and vanilla and fold
  together. Sift flour and salt over batter, folding in gently but
  thoroughly. Transfer to prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F for 25
  minutes or until the top springs back when lightly touched.  Let cool

  if mousse extends over the sides. Set remaining layer, cut side over
  mousse, pressing gently. Cover and chill thoroughly, overnight if
  possible. Release sides of pan, and using a wide lifter, transfer
  cake to service plate, doily-lined if you've thought that for ahead.

  cream until it's stiff and firm.
   Sweeten with sugar and spread ivenly over top and sides of cake.
  Arrange berry slices in circle around the top and bottom edges of the

  into a medium-sized mixing bowl. Add the butter to the flour all at
  once. Mix together until well blended.  Then add the shortening and
  continue to blend by cutting it into the flour mixture.  The mixture
  will begin to look like crumbs or small pebbles. It will have the
  texture of oatmeal. Sprinkle the water over the dough, distributing
  it evenly throughout.  The dough will be come sticky and cling
  together.  Gather it into a ball and wrap it in plastic wrap. Chill
  for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
   When the pastry has chilled, roll it out on a pastry board to a
  thickness of 1/8-inch.  The easiest way is to roll the dough between
  2 sheets of waxed paper.
   Roll the dough up onto the rolling pin and transfer it to a 9-inch
  pie tin.  Gently press it into the tin without stretching it. Use the
  excess pastry to make flutes or cut away the excess with a sharp
  knife or scissors.  Prick the bottom of the pastry shell thoroughly
  to prevent trapped air from bubbling the dough. Butter a sheet of
  aluminum foil and place the foil down into the shell. Weight it down
  with weights or beans to keep the crust from lifting up.  Bake the
  crust for 7 to 10 minutes then remove the weight and the foil. Return
  the crust to the oven and continue baking for another 8 to 10 minutes
  or until the crust is lightly browned. If you have difficulty rolling
  out the dough, do not reroll it; just patch the tears or holes.
  Rerolling will make the pastry tough. FILLING: Preheat the oven to
  350 degrees F.  Press the cottage cheese through a sieve. In a small
  saucepan, gently heat the cream and the sherry until steamy, do not
  allow it to scorch.  In a mixing bowl, beat together the eggs, egg
  yolks, sugar, rosewater, and the spices until frothy -- about 5
  minutes. In a large mixing bowl, beat the cottage cheese until it is
  smooth then add the egg mixture and blend well.  Add the hot cream
  and sherry slowly to the cheese mixture and beat until well blended.
  Stir in the currants and pour the mixture into the prepared crust.
  Bake for about 30 minutes, then allow to cool.  Chill and sprinkle
  with cinnamon.

  *    You can also use Large-Curd Cottage Cheese if the Farmers Cheese
  is ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- NOTE:  THIS IS A SPECIAL CAKE REQUIRING A NEW
  LARGE FLOWER POT 7 X 7-INCHES AT A MINIMUM. Press the cheese through
  a sieve. Combine the cheese with the egg yolks, beating in 1 yolk at
  a time. Add the sugar and blend well. Heat the cream in a large
  saucepan until it almost boils, then add the cheese mixture and cook
  over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens.
  Remove from the heat before it begins to boil. Stir in the fruits,
  almonds, and lemon rind.  Cool.  Cream together the butter and the
  vanilla, then stir into the cooled cheese mixture. Line the flower
  pot with several layers of moistened cheesecloth, leaving enough
  cloth at the top to form a flap that will cover the pot. Fill the pot
  with the cheese mixture and cover with the flap. Put a weight on the
  top and place in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.  The whey (liquid)
  will drip out the bottom of the pot, so be sure to place a pan under
  it. When drained, carefully unmold the cake with a knife.  Remove the
  cheesecloth and smooth the sides with a hot knife.  Prepare the
  sauce. Beat together the egg yolks, sugar, Madeira, and lemon rind in
  the top of a double boiler. Cook and continue beating until the
  mixture thickens.  Stir in the lemon juice and the rum, then chill
  briefly.
   Pour the sauce over the cheesecake and serve. NOTE: This very unusual
  cheesecake is a traditional Russian Easter dish. In the old days, the
  custom was to decorate it with paper flowers or religious emblems and
  have the priest come by and bless it.  Back then, it was made in a
  special pyramid-shaped form, but you can make it in an ordinary red
  clay flower pot.
   Visually, the effect is quite striking, and the drainage hole allows
  the excess whey to escape.  To make paskha, you will need a large
  flower pot and some cheesecloth. The paskha will keep in the
  refrigerator for several weeks, but be sure to make it at least three
  days in advance.

  1 1/2 c  Unbleached Flour; Sifted            1 ea Egg; Large, Separated, **
      1 x  Sugar; Granulated, *              1/2 c  Butter; Softened, ***
 
  *     Use from 1/4 to 1/3 cup of granulated sugar. (To Taste.) **
  Separate the large egg and lightly beat the yolk. *** Use only sweet
  cream, unsalted butter in this recipe. NO MARGARINE.
  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
   Working on a large flat surface, such as a pastry board, place the
  flour and the sugar in the center of the surface and mix together.
  Form a small depression or well in the center of the mound. Add the
  beaten egg yolk and the softened butter to the well, ten blend these
  with the dry mixture. Mix the ingredients thoroughly using your hands
  ~- there's no substitute for warm hands. Shape the dough into a ball
  and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill for at least 10 minutes.  Roll out
  the dough to a thickness of about 1/4-inch. You should have a circle
  of about 11 inches in diameter.
   For best results, roll out your dough between 2 sheets of waxed
  paper, then peel away the paper and cut the crust in a 9-inch circle.
  Place the circle inside a 9-inch springform pan. Prick the crust
  several times with a fork to keep the crust from puffing up during
  the baking. Place the springform pan in the oven and bake for 15 to
  20 minutes, or until light brown.  Allow to cool.  Using the leftover
  dough, line the sides of the springform pan. Press the dough against
  the sides of the pan, smoothing it so as to have a continuous layer
  of crust all the way around the sides of the pan.  Make sure that the
  side crust meets the bottom crust all the way around.  Brush the
  reserved egg white onto the shell, covering the bottom and sides.
  This will seal the dough and keep it from becoming soggy. Set aside
  until ready to use. NOTE: For the Italian Cheesecake, add 1 ts of
  grated lemon rind and 1 ts of Amaretto Liqueur when adding the egg
  yolk and butter.

    1/4 c  Peanut oil                          2 t  Fresh ground black pepper

      1 t  Chopped oregano                     1 x  Salt
      1 ea Small hot pepper chopped OR    
 
  Shrimp should be of a size to number 30-35 per pound. Melt the butter
  and oil in a flameproof baking dish.
   Add the garlic, herbs, peppers, bay leaves, paprika, and lemon
  juice, and bring to a boil.  Turn the heat down and simmer 10
  minutes, stirring frequently. Remove the dish from the heat and let
  the flavors marry at least 30 minutes.  This hot butter sauce can be
  made a day in advance and refrigerated.
     Preheat the oven to 450F.  Reheat the sauce, add the shrimp, and
  cook over medium heat until the shrimp just turn pink, then bake in
  the oven about 30 minutes more. Taste for seasoning, adding salt if
  necessary. Nathalie Dupree writes of this recipe in her book "New
  Southern Cooking," "Shrimp taste better when cooked in their shells
  because the fat under the shells preserves their flavor and
  tenderness. When the shells are crisp it is a pleasure to eat the
  shrimp with their shells on. This rich butter sauce cries out to be
  sopped up with crusty bread once the shrimp are gone."

    1/2 c  Butter                         
 
  Preheat the oven to 400F.  Sift together the flour, sugar, salt, and
  baking soda into a bowl or food processor. Cut in the butter. Add the
  sour cream and Creole Seasoning (see recipe for Creole Seasoning),
  and mix to a soft dough.  Roll out paper-thin on a floured board. Cut
  into 1-1/2 inch squares.  Sprinkle with kosher salt and place on an
  ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 5-8 minutes.  Turn off the heat and
  allow the bread to crisp in the oven. Nathalie Dupree describes this
  recipe in her book "New Southern Cooking" this way; "This crisp,
  cracker-like bread is good just flavored with salt and sour cream.
   But add Creole Seasoning and you'll have a hot and spicy appetizer
  that will leave your guests begging for the recipe. It's nice to keep
  a big airtight cookie jar full of these for snacking."

      2 qt Cold water                          1 ea Large clove garlic (note)
      1 ea Med. onion, (see note)              1 x  Bones, excess meat (notes)

  1 1/2 lb Backs, necks, bones (notes)   

MMMMM--------------------BEEF OR TURTLE STOCK-------------------------
      2 lb Beef shank (see notes)        

MMMMM-------------------------PORK STOCK------------------------------
      2 lb Pork neck bones (see notes)   

MMMMM-----------------------SEAFOOD STOCK----------------------------
      2 lb Rinsed shrimp heads (notes)    
 
  Notes:  To the basic stock, you can also add vegetable trimmings from
  the recipe(s) you are serving, in place of the onion, garlic and
  celery. The recipe calls for the onion and garlic to be unpeeled and
  quartered.
     Also, you may include bones and any excess meat (excluding livers)
  from meat or poultry, or shells or carcasses from seafood, used in
  the recipe(s) you're cooking, or FOR FOWL AND GAME STOCKS: 1 1/2 to 2
  pounds backs, necks and/or bones from chickens, guinea hens, ducks,
  geese, rabbits, etc. FOR BEEF OR TURTLE STOCKS: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds
  beef shank (preferred) or other beef or turtle bones. FOR PORK STOCK:
  1-1/2 to 2 pounds pork neck bones (preferred) or other pork bones.
  FOR SEAFOOD STOCK: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds rinsed shrimp heads and/or
  shells, or crawfish heads and/or shells, or crab shells (2-1/2 to 3
  quarts), or rinsed fish carcasses (heads and gills removed), or any
  combination of these. (you can also substitute oyster liquor for all
  or part of seafood stock called for in a recipe). NOTE: If desired,
  you can first roast meat bones and vegetables at 350F until
  thoroughly browned.
   Then use them to make your basic stock.  (When you brown the bones
  and vegetables, the natural sugar in both caramelizes on the surface,
  which gives the stock a fuller taste and adds color when it dissolves
  in the stock water.) Always start with cold water--enough to cover
  the other stock ingredients.  Place all ingredients in a stock pot or
  a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then gently simmer
  at least 4 hours, preferably 8 (unless directed otherwise in a
  recipe), replenishing the water as needed to keep about 1 quart of
  liquid in the pan. The pot may be uncovered, or set the lid on it
  askew.  Strain, cool and refrigerate until ready to use.  (Note:
  Remember if you are short on time, using a stock simmered 20 to 30
  minutes is far better than using just water in any recipe..) TO MAKE
  A RICH STOCK: Strain the basic stock, then continue simmering until
  evaporation reduces the liquid by half or more. For example, if your
  recipe calls for 1 cup "Rich Stock," start it with at least 2 cups of
  strained basic stock.  (Rich stocks are needed when a sauce requires
  lots of taste but only a limited amount of liquid, for example,

    3/4 t  Ground cayenne pepper             1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese

MMMMM-------------------FLOUNDER SEASONING MIX------------------------
      2 t  Salt                              1/4 t  Ground cayenne pepper
      1 t  Sweet paprika                     1/4 t  Dried thyme leaves
    1/2 t  White pepper                      1/4 t  Dried sweet basil leaves
    1/2 t  Onion powder                        6 ea Flounders (see note)
    1/2 t  Garlic powder                   1 1/2 c  Grated cheddar cheese
    1/2 t  Dry mustard                         1 x  Vegetable oil for frying
 
  NOTE: Flounder should be 1 to 1-1/4 pounds each, boned, heads removed
  and brown side split down the center. Combine the first seasoning mix
  ingredients in a small bowl; mix well and set aside. In a large
  skillet fry the bacon over high heat until crisp. Add onions, celery
  and bell peppers. Stir well and saute until vegetables start to get
  tender, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add 3 tablespoons of
  the butter and the white and red peppers; stir until butter is
  melted. Stir in the shrimp and the first seasoning mix. Continue
  cooking for about 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping
  pan bottom well. Stir in the stock and the oysters; cook and stir
  about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Use a slotted spoon to spoon
  the seafood vegetable mixture into a food processor or blender,
  leaving the liquid in the skillet; process mixture until smooth,
  about 15 to 30 seconds. Return mixture to skillet, stirring to blend
  with liquid; turn heat to high, and cook until mixture starts
  sticking excessively, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally and
  scraping pan bottom well. Remove from heat. Meanwhile, in a 1-quart
  saucepan melt the remaining 6 tablespoons butter over high heat; when
  almost melted, remove from heat, then add 1/4 cup of the flour and
  stir until mixture is smooth. Return to high heat for 1 minute,
  stirring constantly. Turn heat to high under the stuffing mixture;
  gradually add the butter-flour mixture, stirring constantly until
  well blended. If mixture starts "weeping" oil at this point, stir in
  about 2 tablespoons more stock or water.) Continue cooking until very
  thick, about 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the green
  onions and cook 1 minute more, stirring constantly. Remove from heat
  and stir in the Parmesan. Cool slightly, then refrigerate until
  chilled, about 30 minutes. In a small bowl thoroughly combine the
  flounder seasoning mix ingredients. Open the flounders for stuffing.
  Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon ofthe seasoning mix on the inside of each
  flouner. Mound 1/4 cup of the cheddar cheese in the center of each,
  then spoon a scant 1/2 cup chilled stuffing on top of the cheese.
  Close the fish so the stuffing doesn't show. Cover and refrigerate
  for 1 to 2 hours. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of the seasoning mix on each
  side of each chilled flounder, patting it in with your hands. In a
  pan (cake and pie pans work well) combine the remaining seasoning mix
  with the remaining 1/2 cup flour. In a large, heavy skillet heat 1/4
  inch oil over high heat to about 350F. Meanwhile, place each flounder
  (split side up) in the seasoned flour to coat only the bottom
  surface. Carefully slide each flounder into the hot oil and fry the
  bottom until it's crispy, crunchy and brown-brown!-- about 3 to 4
  minutes. Without draining, place the flounder, still split side up,
  on an ungreased cooke sheet. Bake at 550F until the fish are cooked
  and well browned on top, about 10 minutes (after about 4 minutes,
  drape a piece of aluminum foil over the tails so they won't burn).
  Serve immediately as is, or topped with Hollandaise Sauce, Shrimp and
  Crab Buttercream Sauce, or Bearnaise Sauce From Paul Prudhomme's

      2 T  Vegetable oil                       1 t  Worcestershire sauce
      3 T  All-purpose flour                   2 c  Hot basic seafood stock
    1/4 c  Finely chopped onions               2 T  Burgundy wine
      4 t  Canned tomatoe sauce                2 T  Unsalted butter, softened
 
  Serve this delicious sauce over broiled, fried or baked fish fillets
  or broiled, fried or baked oysters.
     Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set
  aside. Heat the oil in a heavy 1-quart saucepan over high heat just
  until the oil starts to smoke, about 1 to 2 minutes. With a metal
  whisk, mix in 2 tablespoons of the flour, whisking constantly and
  scraping pan bottom well, until the roux is dark red-brown to black,
  about 2 minutes, being careful not to let it scorch or splash on your
  skin. (Remove from heat momentarily if it is browing too fast for you
  to control, continuing to stir constantly.)  Immediately whisk in the
  onions; reduce heat to low and continue stirring and cooking about 1
  minute. Add the tomato sauce and stir and cook 1 minute.  Then stir
  in the seasoning mix and the Worcestershire (the mixture should now
  be thick and dark red-brown); cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring
  constantly.  Add the stock; turn heat to high and bring to a boil,
  stirring often.
   Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook about 6 to 8 minutes,
  stirring often.  Stir in 1 tablespoon of the burgundy and remove from
  heat. In a small bowl mix the butter and remaining 1 tablespoon flour
  until creamy. Return sauce to low heat; gradually add the butter
  mixture to the sauce, whisking until well blended each time. Return
  sauce to a simmer and simmer 10 minutes, stirring often.  Add the
  remaining 1 tablespoon burgundy. Remove from heat and discard bay
  leaf. Serve immediately. From Paul Prudhomme's "Louisiana Kitchen"

      Title: Very Hot Cajun Sauce for Beef
 Categories: Cajun/creol, Salsa/sauce
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    3/4 c  Chopped onions                    1/2 t  White pepper
    1/2 c  Chopped green peppers             1/2 t  Black pepper
    1/4 c  Chopped celery                      2 ea Bay leaves
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil                     1/4 c  Minced jalapeno peppers(note
    1/4 c  + 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour          1 t  Minced garlic
    3/4 t  Ground cayenne pepper               3 c  Basic beef stock
 
  NOTE: Fresh jalapenos are preferred; if you have to use pickled ones,
  rinse as much vinegar from them as possible. Combine the onions, bell
  peppers and celery in a small bowl and set aside while you start the
  roux. (NOTE: Unlike the roux in most other recipes in this book, the
  roux we use here is light brown. Therefore, instead of heating the
  oil to the smoking stage, we heat it to only 250F; this prevents the
  roux from getting too brown.) In a heavy 2-quart saucepan heat the
  oil over medium-low heat to about 250F. With a metal whisk, whisk in
  the flour a little at a time until smooth. Continue cooking, whisking
  constantly, until roux is light brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Be
  carefyul not to let the roux scorch or splash on your skin.  Remove
  from heat and with a spoon immediately stir in the vegtable mixture
  and the red, white and black peppers; return pan to high heat and
  cook about 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the bay leaves,
  jalapeno peppers and garlic, stirring well. Continue cooking about 2
  minutes, stirring constantly.  (We're cooking the seasonings and
  vegetables in the light roux and the mixture should, therefore, be
  pasty.) Remove from heat.
     In a separate 2-quart saucepan, bring the stock to a boil. Add the
  roux mixture by spoonfuls to the boiling stock, strirring until
  dissolved between each addition. Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce
  heat to a simmer and cook until the sauce reduces to 3-1/2 cups,
  about 15 minutes. Skim any oil from the top and serve immediately.

 Categories: Cajun/creol, Main dish, Fish
      Yield: 2 servings

      1 t  Ground cayenne pepper             1/2 t  Dried thyme leaves
      1 t  Black pepper                      1/2 t  Dried rosemary leaves, crush
    1/2 t  Salt                              1/8 t  Dried oregano leaves
    1/2 t  Crushed red pepper            

MMMMM----------------------MAIN INGREDIENTS---------------------------
    1/4 lb + 5 Tbsp unsalted butter          1/2 c  Basic shrimp stock
      1 t  Worcestershire sauce              1/4 c  Beer at room temperature
  1 1/2 t  Minced garlic                  
 
  Rinse the shrimp in cold water and drain well.  Then pinch off and
  discard the portion of the head from the eyes forward (including the
  eyes, but not the protruding long spine above the eyes). Leave as
  much as possible of the orange shrimp fat from the head attached to
  the body. Set aside. In a small bowl combine the seasoning mix
  ingredients. combine 1 stick of the butter, the garlic,
  Worcestershire and seasoning mix in a large skillet over high heat.
  When the butter is melted, add the shrimp. Cook for 2 minutes,
  shaking the pan (versus stirring) in a back-and-forth motion. Add the
  remaining 5 tablespoons butter and the stock; cook and shake pan for
  2 minutes.  Add the beer and cook and shake the pan 1 minute longer.
  Remove from the heat.
     Serve immediately in bowls with lots of French bread on the side,
  or on a platter with cooked rice mounded in the middle and the shrimp
  and sauce surrounding it. LAGNIAPPE:  A certain percentage of oil is
  released when butter is melted, shaking the pan in a back-and-forth
  motion and the addition of stock to the butter keep the sauce from
  separating and having an oily texture--stirring doesn't produce the
  same effect. From Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen

  5 1/2 t  Ground cayenne pepper          
 
  NOTE:  Fresh jalapenos are preferred; if you have to use pickled ones,
  rinse as much vinegar from them as possible. Melt the butter in a
  4-quart saucepan over high heat. Add the onions, bell peppers and
  celery; saute about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the
  tomatoes, tomato sauce, jalapenos, bay leaves, ground peppers and
  garlic; stir well. Continue cooking about 3 minutes, stirring often
  and scraping the pan bottom well. Stir in the stock, sugar and salt
  and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors are
  married, about 20 minutes, stirring often and scraping pan bottom as
  needed.  (If mixture scorches, quit stirring and pour mixture into a
  clean pot, leaving the scorched ingredients in the first pan.) Add
  the shrimp to the hot (or reheated) sauce and stir. Turn heat up to
  high, cover pan, and bring mixture to a boil. Remove from heat. Let
  sit covered for 10 minutes. (Meanwhile, heat the serving plates in a
  250F oven.)  Stir, remove bay leaves, and serve immediately. To
  serve, mound 1/2 cup rice in the center of each heated serving plate;
  then pour about 1/2 cup sauce around the rice and arrange about 8
  shrimp on top of the sauce. LAGNIAPPE:  "Piquant" to a Cajun means
  "it's hot and 'hurts like a sticker in your tongue.'" If you want
  less "piquant," reduce the jalapeno peppers by half.  Sauce Piquant
  is enjoyed with such gusto in Louisiana that the town of Raceland has
  a Sauce Piquant Festival every year dedicated to nothing but fish,
  meat, fowl and seafood made with variations of this sauce. From Paul

    3/4 c  + 4 tsp. Parmesan cheese            1 x  Vegetable oil for pan frying
  1 3/4 c  Very fine dry bread crumbs     
 
  NOTE:  You will need 6, 3-1/2 to 4 ounce slices of baby white veal,
  pounded thin for this recipe.
     Place the water, the 2 tablespoons oil and the salt in a large pot
  over high heat; cover and bring to a boil. when water readdds a
  rolling boil, add small amounts of fettucini at a time to the pot,
  breaking up oil patches as you drop it in.  Return to boiling and
  cook oncovered to al dente stage (about 3 minutes if fresh pasta, 7
  minutes if dry); do not overcook.
   during this cooking time, use a wooden or spagheti spoon to left
  fettucini out of the water by spoonfruls and shake strands back into
  the water. (It may be an old wives' tale, but this procedure seems to
  enhance the pasta's texture.)  Then immediately drain in a colander
  and stop its cooking by running cold water over strands (if you used
  dry pasta, first rinse with hot water to wash off starch); after it
  has cooled thoroughly, about 2 to 3 minutes, pour a liberal amount of
  vegetable oil in your hands and toss fettucini.  set aside still in
  the colander.    Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-low
  heat; add the cream and cayenne pepper. Turn the heat to medium-high.
  with a metal whisk whip the cream nmixture constantly as it comes to
  a boil.  the reduce heat and simmer until the sauce has reduced some
  and thickened enough to coat a spoon well, about 7 to 8 minutes,
  whisking constantly.  Remove from heat and gradually add 3/4 cup of
  the parmesan, whisking until cheese is melted. Set aside.
     Heat 6 large serving plates in a 250F oven. In a shallow pan (cake
  and pie pans work well) combine the bread crumbs, parsley, olive oil,
  white pepper, onion and garlic;, mix well. In a separate pan beat the
  eggs well, then beat in the remaining 4 teaspoons Parmesan. Soak the
  veal in the egg mixture for at least 5 minutes, being sure to coat it
  thoroughly.
   Meanwhile, heat 1/4 inch oil to about 400F in a large skillett.
  Then, just before frying, dredge veal in the bread crumbs, coating
  well and pressing the crumbs in with your hands; shake off any
  excess. Fry the veal in the hot oil until golden brown, about 1
  minute per side. Do not crowd. (Change the oil mid-way through frying
  if the crumbs in the bottom start to burn.) Remove veal to a large
  platter and set aside.
      Reheat the cheese sauce over medium-high heat, whisking
  frequently. (NOTE:  If butter starts separating from the sauce, whisk
  in about 1 tablespoon cream or water.)  Add the fettucini and loss
  until tho9roughly coated and heated through, about 1 minute. Remove
  from heat and serve immediately.    To serve, place a piece of veal
  on each heated serving plate.  roll each portion of fettucini onto a

  1 1/2 c  Julienned zucchini (see note        1 x  Very Hot Cajun Sauce/Beef
      1 c  Julienned squash (see Note)    
 
  NOTE:  To julienne squashes, cut peelings 1/8 inch thick and cut
  these into strips 1/8 inch wide and 2 inches long; use only strips
  that have skin on one surface. Cut carrots and onions into similar
  strips.
     In a 13x9-inch ungreased baking pan, combine the beef and pork.
  Mix in the eggs and bread crumbs by hand until thoroughly mixed. Set
  aside. In a 1-quart saucepan, combine 3 tablespoons of the butter,
  the onions, celery, bell peppers, garlic, Worcestershire, Tabasco and
  meat seasoning mix. Saute over high heat about 5 minutes, stirring
  frequently and scraping the pan bottom well.  Remove from heat and

      Title: Pecan Pralines - Prudhomme
 Categories: Cajun/creol, Candy
      Yield: 36 servings
 
  1 1/2 ea Sticks unsalted butter              1 c  Milk
      1 c  Sugar                               1 c  Chopped pecans
      1 c  Packed, light brown sugar           2 c  Pecan halves
    1/2 c  Heavy cream                         2 T  Vanilla extract
 
  NOTE: To judge doneness, use one or more of the following guides; 1.
  Candy thermometer will read 240F 2. When done, the batter will begin
  forming distinct threads on the sides or bottom of the pan. 3. Near
  the end of the cooking time, make a test praline every few seconds.
  The early-test pralines will be somewhat runny, very shiny and
  somewhat translucent. The ideal praline will have progressed past
  that stage--it will not be runny and will be less shiny; when cooled
  it will be opaque, lusteriess and crumbly instead of chewy. 4.  Near
  the end of the cooking time, drizzle spoonfuls of the mixture across
  the surface of the mixture. When ready, the mixture will form a neat
  thread across the surface.
     Assemble all ingredients and utensils before starting to cook. You
  will need a large heavy bottomed aluminum pot or skillet with deep
  sides, a long handled metal whisk or spoon, 2 large spoons (or an ice
  cream scoop with a manual release) and a lightly buttered cookie
  sheet. Be careful not to get any of the mixture on you skin, as it
  sticks and can cause serious burns. Melt the butter in the pot over
  high heat. As soon as it's melted, add the sugars and cream.  Cook 1
  minute, whisking constantly.
   Add the milk and chopped pecans,  cook 4 minutes more, whisking
  constantly.  Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking and whisking 5
  minutes.  Add the pecan halves and vanilla and continue whisking and
  cooking until done, about 15 to 20 minutes longer (see NOTE above on
  tests for doneness).  If mixture starts to smoke toward end of
  cooking, lower the heat.
     Remove pan from heat.  Quickly and carefully drop the batter onto
  the cookie sheet by heaping spoonfuls, using the second spoon to
  scoop the batter off the first (or use ice cream scoop). Each praline
  should form a 2-inch patty about 1/2 inch thick.  Cool and store in
  an airtight container, or wrap each praline in plastic wrap or foil.
  LAGNIAPPE: To clean the pot and utensils, boil water in the pot with
  the utensils in it. This will melt the batter off. From Paul
  Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen

      Title: Chocolate Pecan Pralines - Prudhomme
 Categories: Cajun/creol, Candy
      Yield: 24 servings
 
  1 1/2 ea Sticks unsalted butter              1 c  Coarsely chopped pecans
      1 c  Sugar                               2 c  Whole pecan halves
      1 c  Packed, light brown sugar           2 T  Vanilla extract
      1 c  Milk                            1 1/2 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
    1/2 c  Heavy cream                    
 
  NOTE: Chocolate chips should be chilled.
     Assemble all the ingredients and utensils before starting to cook.
  (Measure out the chocolate chips and keep them refregerated until just
  before needed.)  You will need a large, heavy-bottomed aluminum pot or
  skillet with deep sides, a long-handled metal whisk or spoon, 2 large
  spoons (or an ice cream scoop with a manual release) and a very
  lightly greased cookie sheet. Melt the butter in the pot over high
  heat; add the sugars, milk, cream and chopped pecans.  cook 5
  minutes, whisking constantly.  reduce heat to medium, and continue
  cooking and whisking 10 minutes.
   Add the pecan halves and continue whisking and cooking until done,
  about 8 to 10 minutes.  (If the mixture smokes excessively toward end
  of cooking time, lower thge heat.) Stir in vanilla. then immediately
  drop about 1/4 cup of chocolate chips into about one-sixth of the
  batter. Stir quickly and just enough to cover some of the chips with
  batter but not nenough to allow the chips to melt.  Quickly drop the
  chocolate mixture onto the cookie sheet by heaping spoonfuls, using
  the second spoon to push the batter off the first (or use ice cream
  scoop); each praline should be about 2 inches in diameter and 1/2
  inch thick. repeat with remaining mixture, stirring briefly before
  adding more chocolate chips.  The cooled pralines should be light
  brown, opaque, somewhat chunky and crumbly. LAGNIAPPE: To clean the
  pot and utensils, boil water in the pot with the utensils in it. This
  will melt the batter off. From Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen.

      Title: Pecan Pralines - Patout
 Categories: Cajun/creol, Candy
      Yield: 24 servings
 
      2 c  Heavy cream                         2 c  Pecan halves
      4 c  Raw or brown sugar                  2 T  Butter
      1 t  Vanilla                        
 
  Alex Patout swears his recipe makes "The creamiest pralines anywhere"
  Butter a medium saucepan--this will make it easier to clean later.
  Pour in the cream and place over high heat. When it begins to boil,
  add the sugar and stir rapidly until it dissolves.  Then stir in the
  vanilla and pecans and continue to cook over medium heat, stirring
  frequently, until the mixture reaches the soft-ball stage (236F on
  the candy thermometer). Remove from heat and quickly beat in the
  butter--this helps arrest the cooking process.  The candy should lose
  its glossy color and become very cloudy. Lay out a long strip of
  waxed paper on a work surface. Moisten it with a damp towel.  Drop
  good-sized spoonfuls of the hot praline mixture onto the waxed paper,
  stirring the mixture occasionally as you go along to keep it well
  combined.  Remove the pralines from the paper before they have cooled
  completely--later on it will be hard to remove them without breaking
  them. Store in tightly sealed containers, with layers of waxed paper
  in between. Makes about 2 dozen From Alex Patout's Cajun home Cooking

      Title: Pecan Pralines - Dupree
 Categories: Cajun/creol, Candy
      Yield: 24 servings
 
      2 c  Sugar                               2 c  Pecan halves
    1/2 c  Light corn syrup                  1/4 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Water                               1 T  Vanilla
 
  Heat the sugar, syrup, water, and pecans in a heavy saucepan until the
  sugar is disolved.  Bring the mixture to the boil, stirring
  occasionally, until it reaches the soft ball stage (240F). Remove the
  saucepan from the heat and add butter and vanilla.
     Allow candy to cool.  Whip until the mixture gradually changes to
  an opaque color and becomes creamy. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto a
  buttered cookie sheet and allow to harden. Makes two dozen. From
  Nathalie Dupree's New Southern Cooking Nathalie Dupree writes,
  "Pralines are traditionally given as Christmas gifts.  Their
  sweetness will linger in your mouth long after the candy is gone."

      Title: Blackened Pork Chops
 Categories: Cajun/creol, Main dish, Meat
      Yield: 6 servings
 
     18 ea 5 oz pork chops, 3/4" thick       3/4 lb Melted unsalted butter (note

MMMMM-----------------------SEASONING MIX----------------------------
      1 T  Salt                            2 1/2 t  Cayenne pepper
      1 T  + 2 tsp white pepper                2 t  Garlic powder
      1 T  + 3/4 tsp black pepper            3/4 t  Dried thyme leaves
  2 1/2 t  Dry mustard                    
 
  NOTE:  The 3/4 pound (3 sticks) unsalted butter, must be kept melted
  and warm in the skillet. Let the chops come to room remperature before
  blackening.  Combine the seasoning mix ingredients thoroughly in a
  medium-size bowl.    Heat a large cast-iron skillet over very high
  heat until it is extremely hot and just short of the point at which
  you see white ash or a white spot forming in the skillet bottom,
  about 8 minutes. (The time will vary according to the intensity of
  the heat source.)
     Heat the serving plates in a 250F oven.    Just before cooking each
  chop, dip it in the melted butter so that both sides are well coated,
  then sprinkle each side generously and evenly with the seasoning mix
  (use between 1/4 and 1/2 teaspoon on each side), patting it in with
  your hands. (If you lay the chop on a plate or other surface to
  season it, be sure the surface is warm so the butter won't congeal
  and stick to the surface instead of to the chop.  Wipe the surface
  clean after seasoning each chop. Use any remnaining seasoning mix in
  another recipe.) Immediately place the chop in the hot skillet.  If
  the chop is very lean, pour about 1 teaspoon butter on top.  (Be
  careful, as the butter may flame up.) If you cook more than 1 chop at
  a time, place each chop in the skillet before buttering and seasoning
  another one.
     Cook uncovered over the same high heat until the underside forms a
  crust, about 2 minutes (the time will vary according to the thickness
  of the chops and the heat of the skillet or fire). Turn the chops
  over and pour about 1 teaspoon more butter on top of each, if needed.
  Cook just until meat is done, about 2 minutes more. Serve the chops
  crustier side up while piping hot. Clean the skillet after cooking
  each batch and repeat the blackening procedure with the remaining
  chops. To serve, place 2 or 3 chops on each heated serving plate. If
  you use a serving plater, DO NOT STACK THE CHOPS. From The Prudhome
  Family Cookbook Some personal notes: If you do not have a heavy duty
  commercial range hood, capable of disposing of an incredible amount
  of smoke, DON'T cook this inside. If you live in an apartment, like I
  do, where your smoke detector is attached to a central fire system,
  you will very quickly become well known to all your neighbors, and
  your local firefighters. In all likelyhood you will also get to meet
  your landlord. A good, 40,000 BTU to 50,000 BTU barbecue will do a
  good job of providing sufficient heat.  Be sure you have all your
  doors and windows closed, and invite your neighbors to the barbecue.
  This method generates a totally unbelievable amount of smoke.
   However, the results are worth it.  Whatever you are cooking by this
  method, it is an entirely incredible taste experience. From Prudhomme
  Family Cookbook

      Title: Blackened Chicken
 Categories: Cajun/creol, Main dish, Poultry, Chicken
      Yield: 8 servings
 
     16 ea 3 oz skinless chicken breast  

MMMMM-----------------------SEASONING MIX----------------------------
      2 T  Salt                                1 t  Onion powder
  1 1/2 t  Garlic powder                       1 t  Ground cumin
  1 1/2 t  Ground black pepper               1/2 t  Gound cayenne pepper
      1 t  White pepper                      1/2 t  Sweet paprika

MMMMM---------------------OTHER INGREDIENTS--------------------------
    3/4 lb Melted unsalted butter         
 
  NOTE: Recipe calls for 16 (3-ounce) skinless boned chicken breasts,
  about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick, or 8 (10-ounce) bone-in leg-thigh
  pieces, or a combination of these. Skin the leg-thigh pieces, then
  bone each piece along the length of the two bones, leaving meat in
  one piece. Trim off excess fat.  Pound each breast or leg-thigh
  fillet to 1/2 inch thick. Let the chicken come to room temperature
  before blackening.
   Thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl.
  Heat a large cast-iron skillet over very high heat until it is
  extremely hot and just short of the point at which you see white ash
  or a white spot forming in the skillet bottom, about 8 minutes. (the
  time will vary according to the intensity of the heat source.) Heat
  the serving plates in a 250F oven. Just before cooking each piece of
  chicken, dip it in the melted butter so that both sides are well
  coated, then sprinkle each fillet evenly with the seasoning mix,
  using about a rounded 1/2 teaspoon on each, and patting it in with
  your hands. (If you lay the fillet on a plate or other surface to
  season it, be sure the surface is warm so the butter won't congeal
  and stick to the surface instead of to the meat. Wipe the surface
  clean after seasoning each fillet.  Use any remaining seasoning mix
  in another recipe.)
     Immediately place the fillet skinned side down in the hot skillet,
  making sure all meat folds are opened up and the meat is lying flat.
  Pour about 1 teaspoon butter on the top of the fillet (be careful, as
  the butter may flame up).  If you cook more that 1 fillet at a time,
  place each fillet in the skillet before buttering and seasoning
  another one. Cook uncovered over the same high heat until the
  underside forms a crust, about 2 minutes. (The time will vary
  according to the thickness of the fillets and the heat of the skillet
  or fire; watch the meat and you'll see a white line coming up the
  side as it cooks.)  Turn the fillets over and pour about 1 teaspoon
  more melted butter on top of each. Cook just until meat is cooked
  through, about 2 minutes more.  Serve the chicken fillets crustier
  side up while piping hot.    Clean the skillet after cooking each
  batch and repeat the blackening procedure with the remaining chicken
  fillets. To serve, place 2 breast fillets or 1 leg-thigh fillet on
  each heated serving plate. If you use a large serving platter, do not
  stack the fillets. Paul Prudhomme warns, "Blackening should be done
  either outdoors or in a commercial kitchen.  The process creates an
  incredible amount of smoke that will set off your own and your
  neighbors' smoke alarms. People with really well-installed commercial
  hood vents at home have gotten away with blackening in their own
  kitchens. They are privileged! Don't push your luck." From The
  Prudhomme Family Cookbook

  you may use the new ones or use gum drops instead for the garnish.
  Syrup from a can of dark cherries might be substituted for the
  Maraschino cherry syrup.

  3 1/2 c  Unbleached Flour; *                 1 ea Egg; Lg
      1 t  Sugar                               1 tb Milk
  1 1/2 t  Salt                                2 tb Celery Seeds
 
  *    You can use up to 4 1/2 cups of flour in this recipe depending
  on the weather.
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  ++++++++++++++++++ Pour the warm water into a warm bowl and add the
  yeast. Stir to dissolve then let stand until light and puffed, about
  5 minutes. Add 1 1/2 cups of the flour, sugar and salt. Beat with an
  electric mixer on the lowest speed for 1 minute.  Beat on medium
  speed for 2 minutes longer. Add the butter to the yeast mixture and
  beat for another 1 minute.
   On the lowest speed on the mixer, beat in 1 egg and 1/2 cup of flour
  until well blended, repeating until the 4 eggs are used up and enough
  flour has been added to make a soft sticky dough. Continue to beat
  with the mixer or by hand, until the dough is glossy and elastic and
  pulls away from the side of the bowl.
   Stir in the cheddar cheese by hand.  Cover and let rise in a warm
  place free from drafts until doubled in bulk, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
  When the dough has doubled in bulk, punch down and place in the
  refrigerator for at least 5 hours or better, overnight. Remove the
  dough from the refrigerator.
   Divide in half and cover and refrigerate the second ball of dough.
  Knead the remaining ball of dough on a lightly floured surface until
  soft and pliable.
   Divide the dough into 3 equal parts and roll each piece into a rope
  12 to 16-inches long.  Braid the ropes, starting in the middle and
  working toward each end. Pinch the ends together so seal them. Grease
  a large baking sheet and place the finished braid on one side of the
  sheet. Repeat with the refrigerated dough. In a small bowl beat the
  egg and milk together. Brush the braids with the egg mixture and let
  the braids rise in a warm place, free from drafts, until dough in
  bulk, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Do not cover.  Midway through the
  rising time, brush with the egg mixture again. Preheat the oven to
  400 degrees F.
   When fully risen, brush with the egg mixture for a final time and
  sprinkle evenly with the celery seeds.
   Bake for 40 minutes in the preheated oven until a wooden skewer or
  pick inserted in the braid comes out dry. Remove from the oven and
  from the baking sheet.
   Cool to room temperature, on wire racks, before slicing.

      1 ea 1" stick cinnamon              
 
  Put the ginger,  garlic, and 4 tablespoons water in blender. Blend
  well until you have a smooth paste. Heat the oil in a wok to medium
  high heat. Brown the meat cubes in several batches and set to one
  side. Put the cardamom,  bay  leaves, cloves,
   peppercorns, and cinnamon into the same hot oil.
   Stir once and wait  until the cloves swell and the bay leaves begin
  to take on  color. Now  put in the onions. Stir and fry for about 5
  minutes or until
   the onions  turn a medium brown color.  Put in the ginger garlic
  paste and stir for 30 seconds.   Add the fried meat cubes and juices.
  Stir for 30 seconds.
    Now put in 1/6 of the yoghurt.   Stir and fry for 30 seconds or
  until the yoghurt is well  blended.
    Add  the  remaining yoghurt,  a  tablespoon at a time, in the same
  way. Stir and fry  for another 3-4 minutes. Now add the rest of the
  broth (a little more for beef than lamb). Bring the contents of the
  pot to a boil, scraping in all browned spices on the sides and bottom
  of the pot. Cover, turn heat to low and simmer for about an hour if
  lamb and two if beef. Every 10 minutes or so, give the meat a good
  stir. When the meat is tender, take off the lid, turn the heat up to
  medium and boil away some of the liquid.   You should end up with a
  tender meat in a thick, reddish brown sauce.   All the fat  that
  collects in the pot may be spooned off the top.
    Sprinkle  the  garam masala and black pepper over the meat before
  you serve and mix them in.

  blender and blend until you have a paste. Heat the oil in a wide,
  heavy, preferable non-stick pot or wok over a medium-high heat. When
  hot. put in just enough meat pieces so they lie, uncrowded in a
  single layer. Brown the meat pieces on all sides, then remove them
  with a slotted spoon and put them in a bowl. Brown all the meat this
  way. Put the cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon into the hot oil. Within
  seconds the cloves will expand. Now put in the onions. Stir and fry
  the onions until they turn a brownish color. Turn the heat down to
  medium.
   Put in the paste from the blender as well as the coriander, cumin,
  and cayenne. Stir  and fry this mixture for 3-4 minutes or until it
  too has browned somewhat. Now put in the meat cubes as well as any
  liquid that might have accumulated in the meat bowl,
   the salt, the cream, and rest of the water or broth (a bit more for
  beef). Bring to a  boil.   Cover,
   turn heat  to  low  and simmer lamb for 1 hour and beef for 2 hours.
  Stir frequently during this cooking period. Skim off any fat that
  floats to the top.  Sprinkle in the garam masala and mix.

      1 oz Unsweetened chocolate               1 T  Vanilla extract
  2 1/3 c  Sifted all-purpose flour            2 ea Egg
  1 1/2 t  Baking soda                         1 T  Milk
    1/2 t  Baking powder                     3/4 c  Finely chopped walnuts
    1/4 lb Unsalted butter                
 
  1.  Melt the chocolate over hot water. 2.  Sift the flour, baking
  soda, and baking powder together. Set aside. 3. In the bowl of a
  mixer, cream the butter. Add the sugar slowly and continue to beat.
  Add the vanilla, then the eggs 1 at a time. Add the chocolate and
  stir to blend. 4. Stir in the dry ingredients and the milk by hand.
  When just blended, mix in the walnuts. Cover and refrigerate dough
  for 30 minutes before rolling. 5. Preheat oven to 375 degres. Lightly
  grease a cookie sheet. 6. To form the cookies, scoop out a portion of
  dough and roll out on a well-floured surface. When dough is 1/4 inch
  thick, cut it into rounds or other desired shapes. Re-roll scraps and
  cut again. 7. Place on cookie sheet (leave room for expansion) and
  bake for 6 to 8 minutes. Watch for any hot spots in the oven and
  don't let these cookies overbrown. VARIATION: For the Brownie Cookie
  Crust, make 1 recipe of Brownie Cookies and chill the dough briefly.
  Lightly grease the back side of a large baking sheet. Roll the dough
  out onto the baking sheet as thinly as possible so that the baked
  product will crumble easily. Bake crust at 375 degrees for 5 to 7
  minutes. Let crust harden, then slide the cookie from the sheet and
  cool completely. Roll over the cookie with a rolling pin until it is
  crushed to a fine crumb. (There should be about 2 1/4 cups of
  crumbs.) Melt 1 stick plus 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter. Mix it
  into the crumbs and pack the mixture over the bottom and up the sides
  of a 10-inch springform pan. Freeze for 30 minutes before filling in
  order to set the crust. Note: When I made this, I made individual
  cookie crumb crusts for the "Kit's Chocolate Mousse" recipe by using
  a large muffin pan.  Line each cup with waxed paper for easy removal.

      3 T  Tarragon; fresh (1 t dry)      
 
  *** See instructions at end if using the optional ingredients. Cut
  chicken into 1/4" wide slices. Melt the butter and olive oil in a
  large heavy skillet. Saute the chicken for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the
  chicken and keep warm. Deglaze the pan with the champagne. Add the
  cream to the pan. Add the tarragon and reduce the sauce for two
  minutes. Put the chicken back into the pan and bring just to a
  simmer. Remove to serving platter. Serve hot with fresh vegetables or
  over rice or pasta. (I serve this over fettucini, or with a side dish
  of Fettucini Alfredo). *** Cut chicken breasts in half only. Place
  each half between sheets of waxed paper and pound with a meat
  tenderizer until about 1/8" thick. Saute shallots in butter until
  tender. Divide shallots equally between the breast halves, spreading
  evenly over each. Place one slice of prosciutto on each breast half,
  fold in half, and secure with toothpicks. Saute about 4 to 5 minutes
  on each side in the butter and olive oil listed in the original
  ingredients. Chicken is done when it springs back when lightly
  pressed with finger. Follow the balance of the instructions listed
  above for the sauce. Source: The original recipe came from "The
  Martha Culbertson Cook Booklet" published by Culbertson Winery. The
  "additional ingredients" modification is my own.

  Flatten chicken breasts between sheets of waxed paper to thickness of
  3/8 inch, using meat mallet or rolling pin. Mix cheese, breadcrumbs,
  minced parsley, salt and pepper in large bowl. Whisk egg with milk in
  medium bowl to blend.  Dip chicken into egg, then into breadcrumb
  mixture, coating completely and pressing to adhere. Shake off excess
  breadcrumbs. Heat oil in heavy large deep skillet to 375 degrees. Add
  chicken and cook until golden brown and cooked through, about 4
  minutes per side. Using tongs, transfer to paper towels and drain.
  Transfer chicken to platter. Melt butter in small saucepan. Mix in
  lemon juice and pour over chicken. Garnish with lemon wedges and
  parsley sprigs. *** My notes: I found that 3/4 cup each parmesan and
  breadcrumbs makes too much coating for 4 chicken breasts, so I
  reduced the amounts to 1/2 cup each- which is still about enough for
  6 breasts. I use Bertolli Extra Light olive oil for frying, and just
  enough to cover the bottom of the skillet.

  Cook bacon in heavy medium skillet over medium heat until beginning to
  brown. Add green onions and stir until softened, about 1 minute. Add
  cream and simmer until beginning to thicken, about 1 minute. Mix in
  1/2 cup Romano cheese and chopped fresh basil. Meanwhile, cook
  fettuccine in large pot of boiling salted water until just tender but
  still firm to bite, stirring occasionally. Drain well.  Return to hot
  pot. Add sauce and stir to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Serve
  immediately, passing additional cheese separately. *** My notes: When
  I made this, I used 1 cup whipping cream, 1/2 cup each Parmesan and
  Romano, 1 tbsp dried basil, and substituted 4 or 5 thin slices of
  Prosciutto for the bacon- frying slightly in butter. I used about 6
  ounces of "Pesto Linguini", which is a thinner pasta containing
  basil. We like LOTS of sauce! Source: Stephanie Dicamillo- Cooking

  In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks.  Slowly add the oil while
  whisking to make a basic mayonnaise.  It will work only if you add
  the oil very, very slowly at first. You can also use a food processor
  to make this dressing, but again, you must add the oil ever so slowly
  to get the desired consistency. Once the mayonnaise is made, add all
  the ingredients except the vinegars. Make sure the the dressing is
  well mixed and ingredients are evenly distributed throughout. Slowly
  stir in the tarragon vinegar and then the red wine vinegar, making
  sure that they are evenly blended.
   This dressing must be stored in the fridge or it will spoil. Yield 5

      Title: Kit's Chocolate Mousse
 Categories: Dessert, Chocolate
      Yield: 12 servings
 
     18 oz Semisweet chocolate                 2 T  Confectioner's sugar
      2 c  Heavy cream; well chilled           2 T  Creme de cacao
      6 ea Egg                                 1 T  Vanilla extract
 
  1.  Melt the chocolate over hot water. Let it cool until only warm. 2.
  While the chocolate cools, whip the cream until it forms medium-stiff
  peaks. Do not overbeat or the mousse will lose some of its smooth,
  light texture. 3.  Separate 4 of the eggs and set the whites aside.
  Combine yolks with the 2 remaining whole eggs in the bowl of an
  electric mixer. Beat until eggs are thick and lemon colored, around 5
  minutes. While the yolks are beating, place the 4 egg whites in a
  clean copper or stainless steel bowl and whisk, preferably by hand,
  until the whites start to stiffen. Sprinkle on the confectioners'
  sugar and beat until you have firm peaks. 4. Working quickly, add the
  cooled melted chocolate and a scoop of the whipped cream to the egg
  yolks. Stir until smooth, then add the remaining cream. When it is
  fully incorporated, add the liqueur and vanilla, then fold in the
  whites until just blended. 5. This mousse can be poured into small
  individual serving dishes or into 1 larger dessert dish. Chill at
  least 4 hours before serving. (Chilling it overnight intensifies the
  flavor.) The mousse may be frozen for up to 2 weeks. Remove from the
  freezer and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight before serving.
  VARIATION: Make a Brownie Cookie Crust from the Brownie Cookies
  recipe, then fill it with the mousse. Chill for 4 hours, then pipe
  whipped cream on top.

  "... Ingredients in a marinade can be varied, but it is important to
  use wine, vinegar, lemon juice, or some acidic liquid to break down
  the connective tissues. This process will make the steak more tender.
  Remaining marinade ingredients add flavor." Use a good-quality olive
  oil or walnut oil; add good-quality wine or vinegar and a combination
  of fresh and dried herbs, seasonings, garlic and soy sauce to make a
  flavorful marinade. 1. Place all ingredients in glass screw-top jar;
  shake vigorously. Arrange meat in shallow glass dish; pierce with a
  fork. Pour marinade over meat; turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate
  several hours or overnight, turning meat occasionally. 2. Remove meat
  from marinade; pat dry. Remove any pieces of spices or herbs that may
  stick to meat. This recipe is a steak marinade, but the ingredients
  can be adapted for other meats using the same techniques.

  A local restaurant serves a simple, but elegant, potato salad as part

   This is my own attempt at duplicating it. Stir the chopped green
  onions into the Dill Cream Dressing.
   Add salt and pepper to taste.  You may also want to add more lemon
  juice or Dijon mustard at this point, as this produces a fairly bland
  dressing. Slice potatoes (leave skins on) about 1/4 inch thick. Place
  in a large bowl and fold in the dressing.  Serve chilled. Best made
  the day before so the flavors have a chance to mingle. Source: Sallie

      Title: Orange Poppyseed Dressing
 Categories: Salad, Dressing
      Yield: 8 servings
 
    2/3 c  Safflower or corn oil               2 T  Honey
    1/4 c  Lime juice                          2 T  Onion; minced
      2 T  Orange juice                        1 T  Poppy seeds
      2 T  Orange rind; grated                 1 x  Salt & pepper to taste
 
  ** I used peanut oil and minced green onions when I made this. I
  served it on a salad of Boston lettuce with melon and chopped
  prosciutto. Slightly toast the poppy seeds (method below). Place all
  ingredients in a screw-top jar. Shake vigorously.  Chill until
  serving. This dressing complements any green salad, but the addition
  of some small chunks of cantelope, honeydew, or star fruit to your
  greens will enhance the orange-honey flavor of the dressing.  Or try
  it over slices of cold roast pork with nectarine wedges on
  watercress. Poppy Seeds:  Did you know that it takes almost a million
  seeds to make a pound?  These tiny bluish-black gems come from the
  opium poppy plant. But even if you eat a million, you won't
  experience any narcotic effect. Connoisseurs say those imported from
  Holland taste best. For even better flavor, seeds should be slightly
  toasted in a 350 degree oven for about 5 minutes.

 Categories: Penndutch, Cake/cookie

      1 ea Lemon, juice of                     1 ea Lemon, rind of
 
  Mix the currants with some of the flour. Work butter and sugar
  together to a smooth cream, then slowly work in whole eggs one at a
  time. Add a little of the flour, rind and juice of the lemon and
  salt. Work in slowly the rest of the flour and the currants. Drop by
  spoonfuls on large buttered pans, pressing flat with a knife as the
  cakes are better when very thin. A good plan is to heat the pan a bit
  and allow the cakes to melt as much as possible before putting them
  in the oven to bake. Be sure to butter the pans thoroughly;
  otherwise, the thin cakes will be difficult to remove.

    1/8 lb Pepper                         
 
  *** The "recipe" specifies ham from corn-fed hogs, and "fine salt
  (best quality)". Since kosher salt is commonly available today, and
  contains no iodine, I changed the ingredients to specify it.
  Mix thoroughly the salt peter, 1 pint salt and brown sugar and rub
  over the hams and let stand for 24 hours. Then rub the meat with the
  pepper and part of the remaining salt. Let stand for 5 days and then
  rub meat again with fine salt. Set aside for 30 days, hang the meat
  up and brush off the salt. Have hams smoked at a good smoke house,
  smoking them for 10 days with wood. When finished, rub entire ham
  with red pepper, wrap carefully in brown paper and then in muslin
  bags and hang up with the hock down. Hams prepared in this manner
  will keep indefinitely, and flavor and quality improve with time.

      1 x  Salt & pepper                  
 
  *** The recipe specified "butter and lard mixed" for "shortening".
  Wash the meat, cover with water, add seasonings to taste and cook
  slowly for several hours. Wash and peel the potatoes and cut into
  thin slices. Cook until tender. Drain off all of the water, add the 3
  Tbsp of butter, salt and pepper to taste, parsley and onion. Mix
  well. Beat the eggs, add to potatoes and beat mixture lightly. Let
  stand until pastry is made. Sift together the flour, baking powder
  and 1/2 tsp salt. Work in the 4 Tbsp of shortening and then add the
  water, using only enough to hold dough together. Roll thin on a
  floured board and cut into large circles, about 10 inches in
  diameter, spread with some of the potato mixture, fold dough to form
  a semi-circle, pressing edges together with prongs of fork. Drop into
  the hot meat and broth, cover pot closely and boil about 25 minutes.
  While these are cooking make a sauce of the 3 Tbsp of butter or bacon
  drippings, add the bread cubes and brown. Stir in the milk. Arrange
  the "Boova Shenkel" on a platter and pour over all the milk sauce.
  Serve at once.

  potatoes and peas are tender, 5 minutes. Set aside to cool. Meat
  Filling: Saute all ingredients until they are crumbly and most of the
  liquid is absorbed. Set aside to cool. Dough: Using a fork, blend the
  flour, oil and salt. Add the water and knead to form smooth dough.
  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour. Wrap in plastic and
  refrigerate for 1 hour. Knead the dough for 1 minute. Cut in half.

  parts of peeled potatoes and pumpkin. When cooked, drain them, add 1
  good sized onion, finely chopped and a piece of butter. Mash all till
  creamy, season to taste and serve with golden sliced of fried salt
  pork or bacon. To quote Mme. Benoit, "Grand-mere was a wizard with
  pumpkin. Her mashed potatoes pumpkin french fried chips were super.
  It's amazing how most of what we enjoyed in our youth remains a
  pleasure as we grow older. In the autumn of 1959 I made these on my
  television show. The amount of mail requesting the recipe was
  unbelievable!"

      Title: Spicy Sweet-Potato Sticks
 Categories: Vegetable, Side dish, Holiday
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 x  Large sweet potatoes                     Salt
      2 tb Vegetable oil                            White pepper
      3 tb Unsalted butter                          Ground ginger
    1/2 c  Water (or as needed)                     Ground cardamom
      3 tb Honey                                    Ground cloves
 
  The potatoes should weigh a total of about 1 1/2 to 2 pounds.
  ======================================================================
  
  Pare the sweet potatoes and cut into short sticks about 1/4" thick
  (if you have a food processor with a disk designed for french fries,
  use that).
  
  Heat the oil and butter in a wok or skillet over medium-high heat;
  don't let the fat brown.  Add the potato sticks and toss to coat;
  season with salt, white pepper, about 1/4 ts each of ginger,
  cardamom, and a small pinch of cloves.  Add 1/2 cup water, adjust the
  heat to medium-low, and cook, tossing often, but gently, for about 5
  minutes, adding drops of water if needed to prevent sticking.
  
  Add the honey and continue to toss-cook until the sticks are just
  tender and nicely glazed, perhaps 3 minutes.  Check the seasonings
  and serve promptly.
  
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  SWEET POTATO STICKS WITH ORANGE AND HONEY:
  
  Omit the ginger, cardamom, and cloves; cook the potatoes with 1 tb of
  freshly grated orange zest (colored rind only, no pith) and, if you
  have it, 2 tb of candied orange peel.  I don't recommend this unless
  you have homemade candied peel -- science has not yet detected any
  flavor in the kind sold in supermarkets.

      1 lg Garlic clove; sliced              1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
           Salt                                     - (fresh)
    1/2 lb Potatoes; peeled                    1 lb Fettuccine
           -cut into 1/2-in cubes            1/2 lb Soft cheese; such as
      3 lg Leeks; white parts only,                 -Taleggio, Bel Paese
           - quartered and sliced                   -or Fresh Mozzarella, sliced
           - 3/8-in thick                 
 
  SLOWLY MELT BUTTER IN HEAVY PAN over low heat with 4 fresh sage
  leaves or 1/2 teaspoon dried, and the sliced garlic. When garlic is
  golden brown, remove it, but continue to cook butter until light
  amber with a distinctly nutty aroma. Scoop foam off top as it rises
  so that you can see the color, then pour it through strainer lined
  with layer of cheesecloth. Meanwhile, bring 4 quarts water to boil.
  Add 1 tablespoon salt and potatoes. Cook 5 to 8 minutes or until
  potatoes are fairly tender, but just short of being done. Rinse them
  immediately with cool water and set them in colander to drain, but
  reserve cooking water for pasta. Chop or crumble remaining sage
  leaves. Heat half the brown butter in wide saute pan, add leeks,
  sage, half the minced garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook over
  medium-low heat until leeks are soft. Add cabbage, 1 teaspoon salt
  and a little water. It might be necessary to add cabbage in stages,
  letting some of it cook down before adding rest. Cover pan and simmer
  until cabbage is cooked. Add Parmesan cheese and season with plenty
  of freshly ground black pepper and salt, if needed, to make flavors
  bright and strong. Return reserved cooking water to boil, add pasta
  and partially cook it, leaving it a little chewier than you would
  want to eat. Drain in colander, return it to empty pan and toss with
  rest of butter, remaining minced garlic and potatoes. Season to taste
  with salt and pepper. Butter casserole and layer half the noodles,
  half the cabbage and most of sliced cheese. Shake casserole so that
  vegetables and cheese can slip in among noodles. Add rest of pasta
  and cheese and finish with layer of cabbage. At this point, dish can
  be refrigerated until ready to bake. Bake at 425F about 20 minutes or
  until hot throughout and cheese is melted. If casserole is cold when
  placed in oven, bake it covered 15 minutes, then remove cover and
  continue baking until heated through. Serve from baking dish.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 tb Butter                            1/2 ts Salt (to taste)
      7 c  Water                           1 1/2 lb Red potatoes; quartered
      3 md Leeks; the white parts only              - lengthwise & thinly sliced
           - chopped or cut                         Freshly ground pepper
           - into 1/4-inch rounds                   Creme fraiche
      6 c  Loosely packed sorrel leaves        1 tb Chives
           -the stems removed and                   - thinly sliced or snipped
           - leaves roughly chopped       
 
  This is a rather rustic soup. For a more refined version, pass it
  through a food mill before serving.
  
  MELT THE BUTTER IN A SOUP POT and add 1/2 cup water. Add the leeks,
  sorrel and salt, then cook gently, covered, for 5 minutes over
  medium-low heat. Add the potatoes and cook another 10 minutes,
  stirring occasionally, then pour in the rest of the water and
  gradually bring the soup to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer until
  the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Once the potatoes are
  soft, help break them down by pressing them against the side of the
  pan, making the soup as rough or smooth as you like. Or, if you
  prefer, pass the soup through a food mill. Taste the soup for salt
  and add more, if necessary. Serve with freshly ground pepper, a
  spoonful of creme fraiche swirled in and a delicate sprinkling of
  chives over the top. If you've got garden chives and they're in
  bloom, separate the individual flowers at the base and sprinkle on a
  few along with the green stems.

  combined. Transfer the mixture to a 2-qt. baking dish. Into a bowl,
  sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  Add
  the butter and shortening and blend the mixture until it resembles
  meal. Add the cheese and toss. Break egg into a measuring cup and add
  buttermilk to it so that the total volume is 1/2 cup. Beat with a
  fork. Add to the flour mixture, stirring until the mixture just forms
  dough. Gather dough into a ball and, on a floured surface, pat it out
  1/2-inch thick. Cut as many rounds as possible using a 2-inch fluted
  biscuit cutter, dipped in flour. Gather the scraps and pat and cut
  again. Arrange the rounds on the chicken mixture. Beat the egg yolk
  with the milk and brush the tops of the biscuits with the wash. Prick
  biscuits with a fork. Bake in the middle of a preheated 450f oven for
  15-25 minutes, or until biscuits are puffed and golden, and the
  filling is bubbling. a 1985 Gourmet Mag. favorite

           Salt                                2 tb Chopped parsley
      4 tb Virgin olive oil                   12    Nicoise olives, pitted; -OR-
      1 lg Leek; white part only,                   - Gaeta or oil-cured
           - finely  diced                          - Black olives, pitted
      1 lg Yellow onion                   
 
  PEEL THE POTATOES AND SLICE them lengthwise into quarters or, if
  large, into 6ths. Trim the fennel, remove the outer leaves if they're
  scarred, and cut into wedges 1/2-inch thick or a little wider. Leave
  some of the core so that the pieces stay intact. Cut the tomatoes
  into large, neat pieces. Bring a pot of water to a boil, add salt to
  taste and the potatoes, and boil for 5 minutes. Remove the potatoes,
  but save the water. While the potatoes are cooking, warm the olive
  oil in a wide pan. When hot, add the leek, onion, garlic, herbs, a
  little salt, saffron, orange zest and bay leaves. Cook slowly over
  medium heat until the onions have begun to soften, after 6 or 7
  minutes, then add the wine. Let it reduce by approximately half, then
  add the tomatoes and their juice, the potatoes, fennel, half the
  parsley and the olives. Pour in enough of the reserved potato water
  to cover, bring to a boil and lower the heat. At this point, you can
  set the stew aside and finish it later, either in the oven or on top
  of the stove. If cooking on top of the stove, cover the pan and cook
  slowly until the vegetables are tender, about 35 minutes. If cooking
  in the oven, preheat it to 375F, cover loosely and bake for about 1
  hour, or until done. Remove bay leaves. Garnish with the remaining
  parsley and serve with a bowl of garlic mayonnaise.

      2 md -Potatoes, boiled & peeled          2 tb Vinegar

      1 c  Olive oil                         1/2    Onion, (optional); grated
 
  Soak the tarama in warm water a few minutes, then rinse and drain. If
  using bread slices, discard crusts, soak bread in water, then squeeze
  dry. Using an electric blender or electric mixer (or old-fashioned
  mortar and pestle), thoroughly blend the bread or potatoes and the
  tarama. Add the olive oil as slowly as possible, blending at medium
  speed, plus a little water if the mixture forms peaks. Add the grated
  onion, if desired, then whip at high speed for a few minutes.
  
  Note: The flavor may be mitigated to suit taste by adding more bread
  or potato; a too-salty taste may be adjusted by dropping in a few
  tablespoons of sour cream while blending. Leftover taramasalata can
  be stored in a covered jar in the refrigerator for 7 to 10 days.

  5 minutes. Drain, then peel when cool enough to handle. Place in a
  small saute pan with half the butter over low heat for 10 minutes. Be
  very careful not to let the garlic burn. Add 1 cup of milk, bring to

  press through a sieve. Drain the potatoes well then put through a
  potato ricer or food mill, or use a potato masher. (Do not use a food
  processor, as it will make the potatoes gummy.) May be prepared up to
  this point ahead of time, then reheated in a 325F oven for 20-to-30
  minutes. Add more butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, 1/2 cup warmed milk
  and seasonings to taste. Serve immediately for best flavor.

 Categories: Main dish, Fish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 cn Salmon (15 oz)                      1 lg Onion
      1 lg Potato                              1 c  Matzoh meal
      1    Egg                            
 
  Cube a large potato and an onion. Then put in a food processor and
  chop until grated. Add egg and mix. Remove to a bowl and add the can
  of salmon. I washed the salmon off to remove the salt as much as I
  could. This optional. Then I mixed the salmon and potato mixture and
  slowly added matzoh meal until mixture was solid enough to make
  patties. After I made patties then I dipped each patty into a dish of
  matzoh meal. Coating all around. Let the patties stand for a while.
  It is a good idea to chill them for about 1/2 to 1 hour to set. Then
  fry patties in hot oil until brown and turn to the other side and
  brown. About 10 minutes on each side. This made me 8 patties. I
  drained the patties on paper towels.

    1/4 c  All-purpose flour              
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F. Pat the meat dry and sprinkle with salt and
  pepper as desired. Heat the oil in a large covered casserole or Dutch
  oven over high heat on top of the stove. Add the meat, without
  crowding, in batches if necessary, and brown well on all sides.
  Remove pieces to a plate as they are done and reserve. Repeat until
  all meat is browned. Pour off any remaining fat, and replace the
  casserole over medium heat. Add the onion, half the carrots, celery,
  garlic and tomato paste. Cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Use
  your spoon to loosen and dissolve the brown bits stuck to the bottom
  of the casserole. Add flour and cook, stirring, an additional minute.
  Add the wine and cook for about a minute to burn off the alcohol.
  Replace the meat (and any juices on the plate) in the casserole and
  add the stock, peppercorns and thyme. Cover, bring to a boil and
  place in the oven for 1 1/4-to-1 1/2 hours, or until meat is tender.
  Meanwhile, combine potatoes, remaining carrots and butter with 1/2
  cup of water in a medium saucepan over medium heat and cook for 5
  minutes. Add the turnips and cook, stirring occasionally, until all
  water is evaporated, leaving the vegetables bathed in butter, about
  another 5 minutes. Add the peas, remove from the heat and set aside.
  Remove the casserole from the oven. Using a slotted spoon, remove the
  meat from the sauce and place it in a bowl. Pour the sauce through a
  fine strainer into another bowl and discard the vegetables and spices
  that remain in the strainer. Replace meat in the pot, add the cooked
  vegetables and the sauce. Cover and place over medium heat for 5
  minutes. Serve piping hot.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 tb Unsalted butter                   1/4 ts Celery seed
      1    Medium onion, finely chopped             Kosher salt
      3    Baking potatoes *                        Freshly ground black pepper

  * (about 10 ounces each), peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices # if
  desired
  ======================================================================
  ====  Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in
  onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent,
  about 5 minutes. Add potato slices and broth; bring to a boil over
  high heat.  Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, about 15
  minutes until potatoes are almost cooked through.  Add celery seed
  and cook for 5 minutes more, stirring frequently to break up the
  potato slices.  Whisk gently with a baloon whisk until soup becomes
  smoother, but small pieces of potato should remain.  Season with salt
  and pepper.  If not serving immediately, you might want to add a
  little buttermilk or extra chicken broth because soup will get
  thicker as it stands.  Makes six 1-cup servings.

 Categories: Cajun/creol, Canadian, Meat
      Yield: 1 servings

      5 c  -Salted water                            -chopped
      5    Potatoes; sliced or cut in               -salt & pepper
           -large pieces                            Summer savory; to taste

MMMMM--------------------POUTINES (DUMPLINGS-------------------------
      1 c  Flour                               1 tb Baking powder
    1/2 ts -Salt                             1/2 c  -Cold water
 
  "Although pot-en-pot contains the same ingredients as fricot, the
  method of preparation is significantly different. The most commonly
  used meats for this dish are chicken and hare but beef, pork, duck or
  goose may also be used. In Cheticamp and on the Magadalen Islands,
  pot-en-pot is called Etouffrage."
  
  Poultines Blanches: In a bowl, mix flour with salt and baking powder.
  Gradually add cold water to the dough as one would when making
  biscuits. Roll the dough fairly thin, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares and
  place in fricot or other dish. Cut the meats into pieces. Place the
  pieces in a large pot with the salted water and bring to a boil.
  Simmer until the meat is tender. Remove the meat from the pot,
  reserving the stock.
   In the bottom of a second large pot, place a layer of potatoes, a
  layer of meat, a layer of chopped onion Season with salt, pepper and
  summer savory and continue adding until there are no ingredients left.
   Add the stock from the simmered meat and just enough water to cover
  three quarters of the ingredients. Cover and simmer for 45 minutes or
  until the potatoes are tender.
   Add Poutines Blanches (dumplings) 7 minutes before it is ready to be
  served, cover for the remaining 7 minutes.
  
  VARIATIONS: To vary the taste, other spices such as cumin or
  coriander may be added to the pot-en-pot. The meat may be sauteed
  before being simmered to improve it's flavour.  Handkerchief
  dumplings (included with Fricot a la Belette may be layered in with
  the ingredients at the beginning of the cooking time, instead of the
  dumplings used.

      6 md Potatoes                        1 1/2 ts Salt
      1    Egg yolk                          1/2    All-purpose flour
 
  These are *not* fluffy dumplings as in chicken and dumplings.  They
  are a "sturdy" potato dumpling served as a side dish to meat, and
  usually with a sweet sauerkraut/carraway/honey dish as the vegetable.
  
                  *                       *                       *
  
  Boil peeled potatoes in small quantity of water.  Drain potatoes
  thoroughly.  Rice potatoes through hand held masher/ricer.  Let
  potatoes cool.  On floured board, gradually add flour working mixture
  into dough with hands.  Shape potato mixture into a long roll and cut
  into 10 slices. Drop dumplings into boiling water and boil gently
  about 5 minutes.
  
  Drain dumplings on paper towel.  The dumplings are fully cooked after
  the boiling process, but traditionally, Czechoslovakians then melt
  butter in a heavy frying pan, and fry the dumplings until they are
  lightly browned on all sides.

  Quite awhile ago, someone was looking for Gluten-Free recipes. Since
  I have developed severe allergies to grains, it was suggested to me
  by someone here on the echo that it could be the gluten content that
  was giving me trouble.  So I decided to try the gluten-free grains.
  The gluten-free grains do not interchange readily in baking recipes.
  A few days ago, I happened upon THE GLUTEN-FREE GOURMET Living Well
  Without Wheat by Bette Hagman at the Half Price Book Store.  This
  book is a real gem and I hope whoever was looking for gluten-free
  recipes sees this msg. We have tried a couple of the recipes and they
  really are pretty tasty--- I hadn't eaten a bakery item in over 3
  months!  Here is the muffin recipe that I made on Easter morning and
  everyone thought they were good.
  
  In the mixing bowl, cream together sugar and shortening.  Then beat
  in the eggs.  Sift together the flour, salt, and baking powder and
  add to the egg mixture alternately with the milk.  Don't overbeat.
  Stir in the vanilla. These are best mixed by hand.  Pour into greased
  muffin cups. Bake in preheated 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes.
  Makes 8 muffins.

  NOTE:  I poured half the batter in the muffin tins and sprinkled a
  mixture of cinnamon and sugar over the batter.  I covered with the
  remaining batter and sprinkled the tops with more cinnamon and sugar.

      3 sm Potatoes; peeled and                1 ds Black pepper
           - cut paper thin with a            10    Dried rice papers
           - peeler and then shredded               - (banh trang)
      1 tb Tree ears; soaked in                2 c  Peanut oil
           - warm water 20 min,           
 
  ~- Combine all ingredients except rice papers and oil.  Cut the rice
  papers into quarters.  Wet the surface of each paper with water (use
  your fingers or a brush) and within about 1 min the paper will become
  flexible enough to be filled.  Place about 1 tbsp of the filling on
  each paper and roll. Heat the oil in a wok to about 350 deg. F. Place
  rolls, flaps-down, into oil and cook 20 min (10 min each side), until
  completely done.
  
   Serve with Buddhist Nuoc Leo.
  
  ~- Disclaimer: This recipe is fat-city.  There is another form of
  spring roll skin which is inherently sticky and stretchy (white and
  barely opaque), and doesn't require deep frying. (One could lighly
  saute the carrots and potatoes beforehand.) I can't remember what
  this wrapper is called.  BTW - With this alternate type of "spring
  roll" fresh chinese parsley or cilantro is often included.
  
  ~- Side note: About forming a spring roll from quartered rice paper...

      1    Leg of lamb (about 4 lbs)                Olive oil
      3 lb Potatoes (about 5 oz each)               Butter
      1    Lemon (may be doubled)                   Rosemary, thyme & oregano
           Honey                          
 
  Put the leg of lamb into a large roasting pan.  Bruise the leaves of
  2 or 3 sprigs of rosemary and sprinkle them over the meat.  Add
  plenty of pepper and 1 tablespoon honey.  Rub the mixture into the
  meat with your hands. Then rub half a lemon over the joint, squeezing
  the juice on to the meat as you do so.  Do not add any salt.  Leave
  to marinate for 4 to 24 hours.
      Peel and quarter the potatoes, then arrange them in a single layer
  round the lamb.  Squeeze lemon juice over the potatoes -- use at
  least half a lemon, or up to one and a half lemons for a strong
  citrus flavour. Carefully pour 1/4 pint water into a corner of the
  roasting pan, then sprinkle over the potatoes and lamb about 2
  tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary, at least 1 teaspoon each fresh
  chopped thyme and oregano, and some salt and pepper.  Drizzle on
  1-1/2 teaspoons honey and 1 tablespoon olive oil, then dot with 1 oz
  butter.  Bake at 425 F (220 C) gas mark 6 for a further 1 to 1-1/4
  hours.  The ingredients will become gilded and will burnish to a rich
  brown in places.  Lift the meat and turn the potatoes occasionally,
  and if necessary, add a little boiling water to the pan to prevent
  drying out.

      2 tb BUTTER                         
 
  Have the butcher split two small fryers or if you prefer, buy cut-up
  chicken pieces. Place the chicken in a shallow pan and douse with
  whiskey. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the pieces; marinate for 2
  hours. Soak some wood chips (they specify Jack Daniel's Barrel chips)
  in water--if you're using regular wood chips, I'd suggest soaking
  them in whiskey? While the chips are soaking, build a charcoal fire
  in your barbecue grill. Use the wood chips in your grill to create a
  good smoking fire. Broil the fryvers over the pit until well cooked.
  Serve with whiskey sauce. FOR WHISKEY SAUCE: Saute the mushrooms and
  green onion in butter until tender. Add whiskey and brown sauce and
  simmer until flavors have blended and the alcohol has evaporated.
  Keep warm until serving time. * BROWN SAUCE - To make Brown Sauce;
  thicken beef bouillon with cornstarch or roux. Or better yet, make it
  from scratch. Shared by ELLIE COLLIN, Prodigy ID# CMKD93F.

  sliced meat. Roll up and place on plate, repeat.  Cover plate with
  plastic wrap and refrigerate from 1 to 8 hours.  Cut into 1/2-inch
  slices and serve. Makes about 4 dozen appetizers. * Pre-packaged
  "Buddig" style meats work well for everyday occasions. # Many

  sticks of butter, 2 tablespoons at a time. Stir in the black beans
  and season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste. Keep the sauce
  warm over simmering water. Lightly brush the flank steak with oil.
  Season with salt and pepper. Grill the steak over a moderately hot
  fire or broil until medium rare, 5 to 7 minutes. Thinly slice the
  steak crosswise on the diagonal and arrange on warmed plates. Spoon
  the sauce over each serving and accompany with warm flour tortillas.

  other dry roasted spices. Put the garlic, ginger, and green chili
  into the  container  of  an electric blender, along with some water.
  Blend until you have a paste. Heat the oil in a 10-12 inch frying pan
  or saute pan over a medium  high flame. When hot put in the onions.
  Stir and fry them until they pick up brown spots. Now pour in the
  garlic-ginger mixture and stir  once. Turn heat to medium. Put in the
  chicken pieces, salt,  as well as the spice coconut mixture in the
  bowl. Stir and fry the chicken  for  3-4 minutes or until it loses
  its pinkness and turn heat to low,  and  cook for 25 to 30 minutes or

      Title: Dixie's Fried Chicken
 Categories: Meat, Poultry, Chicken
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Frying chicken, cut up                   Flour
           Egg                                      Milk
 
  Wash and unless you are 19 and a beanpole with a family history of
  living to 108, skin chicken pieces. PLACE WASHED CHICKEN PIECES on
  CLEAN FRESH paper towel. Beat egg and milk together in bowl. Sift
  flour with the following spices to taste: salt or Lowry's seasoned
  salt, black pepper, Old Bay, curry powder (not much!), poultry
  seasoning, red pepper (not much!) mustard powder (not much!) other
  suitable spices to your taste. MSG may be purchased in ominous
  looking bag from Chinese restaurant supply if you really want to
  emulate the Colonel and really be a slacker, but Lowry's Seasoned
  salt has enough MSG to please most. Should you not prefer MSG, skip
  the Lowry's and use table salt. Note: Some people react to MSG so you
  can query your guests. The Colonel is loaded with MSG, that's what
  makes it taste so much like the Colonel. Deal with MSG according to
  your preferences. On with the show. In a preferably electric skillet
  at 350 (perfect!), or failing that, a non-stick skillet on Med. Hi,
  put on some Puritan oil. (Oil is less likely to splatter you and oil
  does not smoke.) Other oils are OK but Puritan is rated healthiest.
  About 1/4" deep. Allow to reach 350. NEVER place the washed and/or
  cooked chicken back in contact with any surface OR utensil (tongs,
  etc.) that has touched the pre-cooked chicken. There is a very
  prevalent problem with chicken just lately, but cooking takes care of
  it. Always, always, use a clean surface/utensil. Put flour mixture in
  bowl or pie tins, or a bag, depending on if you want to roll or
  shake. Roll or shake chicken pieces in flour mixture; then dip in
  milk mixture. Then roll or shake them in the flour mixture (2nd
  time.) Lower coated chicken pieces into 350 degree oil with tongs (DO
  NOT EVER PIERCE THE PIECES) and cook EIGHT MINUTES ON EACH SIDE.
  Covered skillet yields more tender crust. Uncovered yields crispier
  crust. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EVER poke the frying pieces with a
  fork, knife, etc. Use the 8 minutes on each side rule at 350 degrees.
  Poking releases juices that SPLATTER when they reach the hot oil.
  This burns you. Also, don't let any water or moisture drop into the
  oil. If this does not happen, it will not spatter you. If you need to
  check done-ness, you can remove the very thickest piece from the
  skillet onto a paper towel, and peek down to the bone and check for
  any pink. There should not be any pink. While frying, if the outside
  begins to darken too much before the inside is done, your heat is too
  high. If this happens and you turn it down, you can continue frying
  the pieces at an appropriate heat even with the outisde a little
  dark, and it won't really hurt anything. The inside will still be
  great!
  
  Gravy: When chicken is done, pour out all the oil except for about
  1/8" or a little less depending on how many people want gravy. Mix a
  little bit (about 1/4 cup) of either regular flour or the kind in the
  small round box that PROMISES not to lump, especially for sauces and
  pastes and gravies, with COLD water to make a thin gruel in the
  measuring cup. COLD helps it mix and not lump (this works with
  cornstarch when making cobblers, pies, etc. too!) Mix the flour and
  cold water with fork. Now, assemble extra flour, the whole carton of
  milk, and water, and pepper and salt, in real real easy reach of the
  skillet. Turn up the heat in the skillet with your smaller amount of
  oil and drippin's, to about 425 or "Hi" for a minute. When it looks
  alive again, stir in your flour water mixture REAL FAST and keep
  stirring! It may start to look like it's going to lump but keep
  stirring fast! The object is to brown that flour and oil goop as much
  as you can before you add the milk. This is tricky and it never turns
  out right. When you give up on browning the flour/water/oil goop any
  more before it is cement, slowly begin to add milk and STIR FAST A
  LOT. It will thicken and you add more milk as it cooks. Oh, by the
  way, turn it back down to about 350 or Med. as it bubbles. When you
  have about half the volume of gravy you are going to need, switch to
  water instead of milk. You will not believe if you taste the yummy
  chicken, that more salt and pepper will be needed for this gravy, but
  if you taste it at this point you will see that the gravy is VERY
  bland. You will need to add a LOT of salt, pepper, seasoned salt,
  whatever is your taste. If your gravy does not go right and clumps up
  during the browning stage, you are in fine company. Just go ahead and
  add the milk, stir, and put the whole thing in the food processor;
  afterwards, you can return the mixture to the skillet and teach it
  who's boss. Just remember to season it enough. And serve on top of
  some ho-made mashed potatoes!!!!!! P.S. M.S.G. fans, Lowry's seasoned
  salt is EXCELLENT in mashed potatoes. Not gourmet. But very tasty and
  nobody has to know! Oh, OK, you may want to check with your guests
  before using anything with M.S.G. :-)

  1/2 cup of the stock. Turn the processor on and, with the motor
  running, add stock until you have a creamy consistency. (The mixture
  will absorb the stock.) Pass the pecan-stock mixture through a sieve
  into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the cream, season to taste
  with salt and pepper and serve. PETER KUMP - PRODIGY GUEST CHEFS

      Title: Easy Chicken and Rice Casserole
 Categories: Poultry, Rice, Chicken
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 x  Chicken (white or dark)             1 pk Lipton rice and sauce
      1 cn Cream of mushroom soup         
 
  Uncle Ben's box or envelope of flavored rice (wild or pilaf, etc.)
  can be substituted for Lipton's Rice 'n' Sauce, but if you use plain
  white rice, use long cooking kind (not Minute) and you will have to
  add spices to your taste:  curry, paprika, pepper, etc. whatever you
  wish.  The small packets of Lipton's or Uncle Ben's usually have
  their own flavor pak and no spices need to be added unless you like
  extra pepper.  Combine dry rice, flavor pak if there is one, can of
  cream of mushroom (or cream of chicken or cream of celery) soup, and
  1/2 to 1 full can of water after that.  Stir well with fork as soup
  will be lumpy.  Add washed and skinned pieces of chicken and sink
  them down into the liquid.  Bake at 375 for 45 minutes to an hour
  depending on type of rice--wild rice takes a little longer.  When
  rice is done, chicken is done.  Watch during cooking and if rice
  begins to dry out, add water.  If bake at 400 cooking time is less.
  If mixture was relatively soupy before putting in oven, bake
  uncovered, but if mixture was not very soupy bake covered.  The
  soupier the mixture when goes in oven (how much water you added) the
  less you will need to watch it while baking. If it is looking like it
  is going to still be soupy towards time for it to get done, take
  cover off.  One more thing, cleanup is easier if you sprayed baking
  dish (glass) with Pam or other cooking spray before you put the
  ingredients in the dish (sorry!)

  IN A LARGE SAUCEPAN, heat the oil over a low fire. Add the vegetables
  (including the fresh pumpkin, but not the canned), thyme and bay leaf.
  Reduce the heat, cover, and let cook gently for 8 minutes. Stir
  occasionally to keep the vegetables from browning. Add the broth and
  the pumpkin, if using canned; bring to a boil, reduce heat, and
  simmer, uncovered, for either 20 minutes (fresh pumpkin) or 10
  minutes (canned pumpkin). Puree mixture in batches in a blender. Pour
  pureed soup through a fine strainer back into saucepan and return to
  boil. If it seems too thick, thin with a little hot broth or water.
  (Can be made to this point up to 2 days in advance and refrigerated,
  loosely covered.) Before serving, reheat soup to boiling. Pour back
  into the blender and add the cottage cheese and powdered milk. Blend
  20 seconds. Taste for seasoning. Ladle the soup into 4 heated soup
  bowls; sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the minced fine herbs over each.
  Serve immediately.

      Title: Roast Tarragon Chicken
 Categories: Poultry, Chicken
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 lb Chicken                             1    Celery stalk; sliced
           - (roasting, broiling               1 sm Onion; sliced
           - or frying)                        1 tb Safflower oil
      2 ts Dry tarragon (or dbl. amt.)         2 tb Melted butter
           Freshly ground pepper               1 tb Minced shallots
      4 tb Butter; at room temperature     1 1/2 c  Chicken stock
      1 sm Carrot; sliced                 
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 425F. Lightly pepper the inside of chicken and smear
  with butter, then sprinkle with 2 teaspoons tarragon. Truss the
  chicken, then dry the outside thoroughly and rub with another 1
  tablespoon butter all over the skin.
  
  TO BROWN THE CHICKEN: Set the chicken on a rack, breast side up in the
  roasting pan, place in the oven for 5 minutes. Turn on its left side
  and baste quickly with the oil and butter, return to the oven for
  another 5 minutes. Turn on its right side for another 5 minutes,
  basting as before.
  
  TO ROAST THE CHICKEN: Leave the chicken on its right side. Reduce oven
  temperature to 350F. Strew the vegetables under the chicken and baste
  it again. Leave it for a total of 15-20 minutes, basting it at least
  every 10 minutes. Salt the chicken, turn it on its other side, and
  cook another 15-20 minutes, basting at least every 10 minutes. Turn
  the chicken breast up and continue basting every 10 minutes until it
  is done.
  
  TO TELL IF THE CHICKEN IS DONE: Prick the thickest part of the
  drumstick with a fork. If the juices come out clear yellow, it is
  done. If not, roast another 5 minutes and test again. As a final
  check, lift the chicken and drain the juices from its vent into the
  pan; if the last few drops are clear yellow, it is definitely done.
  Put the chicken on a warm platter, remove the trussing string, and
  let it sit at least 5-10 minutes before carving so that the juices
  will not retreat into the tissues. It can wait a good 30 minutes with
  foil over it. Remove the vegetables and all but 2 tablespoons of fat
  from the pan, leaving as much of the brown juices as you can. Stir in
  the minced shallot and cook 2-3 minutes. Add the stock, 2 teaspoons
  of tarragon and boil rapidly over high heat. As the juices boil,
  scrape up coagulated juices (deglaze the pan) with a wooden spoon.
  Let the liquid reduce to about 1/2 cup. Carve the chicken at this
  point unless you are going to carve it at the table. Any juices may
  be added to the sauce. Just before serving, swirl the final 2
  tablespoons of butter into the hot sauce until it has been absorbed
  and lightly thickened. Dribble the sauce on the chicken, sprinkle
  with minced parsley.

  Gumbo is one of those dishes which don't really suffer if an
  ingredient is added or subtracted--so feel free to modify. This
  specifies andouille (Cajun) sausage, but you could substitute
  kielbasa or even pepperoni.
  
  IN A LARGE POT, saute the sausage until well-browned. Remove from the
  pot. Add half the oil to the pot and add the okra. Cook until soft,
  about 15 minutes. Add the rest of the oil, the onion, green pepper
  and garlic, and cook 10 minutes more. Add the stock, tomato and
  spices. Simmer uncovered for 30 minutes. Add the shrimp and scallops
  and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the crab meat and parsley, simmer
  2-to-3 minutes and serve.

  Heat in frying pan 2-3 Tbsp melted butter or turkey or chicken fat.
  Add thinly sliced onion and diced celery. Heat 5-8 minutes over low
  heat, stirring often. Add 2-3 cups cooked turkey. Cook 5 minutes over
  low heat.
  
  Sauce: Brown the chicken fat (I would use butter) and flour well
  before adding water. Add savory, salt and pepper to taste. When sauce
  is smooth and creamy, add 1/4 cup cream and any remaining turkey or
  chicken gravy. Pour over turkey. Simmer 15 minutes, then serve with
  hot biscuits and pickled beets.
  
  Hot Biscuits: Sift together in bowl, flour, baking powder (no error in
  amount) and salt. Mix together cream with 2 beaten eggs. Add to flour
  and mix just enough to moisten; the dough is rather soft and should
  remain lumpy. Stir as little as possible. Drop by spoonfuls on a
  greased cookie sheet. Cook 16 minutes at 400F.
  
  from Mme. Benoit, "In days that followed Christmas, every bit of the
  turkey was used - the bones for soup, the skin, diced and crisped in
  the oven until browned, then served, instead of butter, on toasted
  homemade bread. So, when it came time to make hash from all the
  little bits and pieces, the children felt that the poor turkey must
  be tired (fatiguee), hence the name.

      1    Egg; slightly beaten                     -coarsely chopped
      2 tb Matza meal*                         1 c  -Warm water
      8 c  Chicken broth                       2 lb Spinach,cooked and slightly

  * Matza meal and Matzots may purchase in some supermarkets and Jewish
  grocery stores.
  
  (The word Hammin (or Hammim) is derived from the Hebrew adjective Ham
  or warm which describes certain dishes that are kept warm for
  prolonged periods of time...In Pitigliano, however Hammin was the
  classic one-course meal for Passover that both rich and poor used to
  make. The only difference between the versions was the in the cuts of
  meat used. Poor people used breast of lamb..and meatballs made with
  beef(when the cost of ground beef was a fraction of the cost of
  chicken.) People who didn't have to worry about the cost used tiny
  rib chops from baby lamb and chicken balls."
  
  Combine ground chicken, 1 Tbsp olive oil, egg, matza meal and 2 Tbsp
  broth in small bowl. Add salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste and mix
  well. In large pot, place the lamb with remaining oil, sprinkle with
  1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper and lightly brown for 2-3 minutes. Add
  garlic, parsley and 1 cup of warm water. Form many tiny bowls with
  the ground chicken mixture and gently add to pot with lamb. Cover and
  simmer 1 to 1/2 hours. Add spinach and 1 Tsp salt and simmer,
  covered, 15 minutes longer. Transfer the lamb chops, half the spinach
  and most of the gravy to a hot serving dish and keep warm. Add
  remaining broth to pot and bring to a boil. Add matza pieces and cook
  4 to 5 minutes. Turn the heat off and let stand 5 minutes before
  serving as a soup. Serve the lamb and spinach as the main dish.

  Passover Chicken Soup with Rice      *matza meal is available at some
  supermarkets and Jewish grocery stores
  
  "I did not learn of the traditional matza ball soup served during the
  first two nights of Passover until I came to this country. Our
  classic soup was a chicken soup with rice to which were added balls
  of chicken breast and whole immature eggs (which are still at the
  stage where the outer shell and white have not yet formed; they are
  perfectly round and vary from less than 1" to less than 1 mm in
  diameter.) It was a beautiful soup to look at, with the white rice,
  the golden meat balls, the orange eggs (from chickens raised on
  private farms ...)...Here in America I could never find immature
  eggs, so I replace them with hard boiled egg yolks.
  
  Grind or finely chop the chicken broth. In a bowl, combine the beaten
  egg with matza meal and 2 Tbsp of water or broth. Mix well; add
  ground chicken, salt, spices and mix well again. Set aside to rest in
  the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes. Shape the mixture into tiny
  balls, no larger than the egg yolks. Bring the broth to a boil; add
  rice, chicken balls and cook, covered for 15-20 minutes. Peel eggs,
  discard whites and place one hard boiled egg yolk in each of the
  eight bowls. Pour the soup over the egg yolks and serve immediately.

  From Mme Benoit, "This was a dish for company and always a source of
  discussion between my grandparents as they had to decide which of the
  chickens were the most tender. I still have the earthenware dish and I
  often (not just for company) make this delicious casserole.
  
  Quarter 2 very tender young broiler. Roll each piece in flour
  seasoned with salt and pepper. Brown in 4 Tbsp butter. Place the
  chicken pieces,as they are browned in an attractive ovenproof
  earthenware casserole. Add 2 large thinly sliced onions to the fat in
  the fry pan, brown, and pour on top of the chicken. Salt and pepper.
  Sprinkle with a pinch of aniseed and savory and pour 1 Tbsp maple
  syrup over each piece of chicken. Deglaze the frying pan with 1/2 cup
  cider or water and pour over the chicken. Bake 40 minutes, uncovered,
  in a 350F oven.

      Title: Turkey Breast Pie for Passover
 Categories: Jewish, Italian, Poultry, Holiday, Turkey
      Yield: 6 servings

  1 1/2 c  Chicken broth;cold                  2    -large fresh sage leaves
  1 1/2 lb Ground turkey breast -OR:           1    Garlic clove;large
  1 1/2 lb Turkey breast; cubed*             1/2 ts Rosemary;dried, wrapped in
    1/2 c  Olive oil                                -cheesecloth
      1 ts -salt                             1/4 c  Pine nuts
    1/4 ts -freshly ground black pepper        2    Eggs;slightly beaten
      1 ds Nutmeg                                   Matza meal*
      1    Bay leaf                            3    Egg yolks
 
  *Matzots and mastza meal may be bought in Jewish grocery stores and
  many supermarkets *The recipe calls for cubes of turkey breast to be
  ground; however I think a substitution of pre ground turkey would be
  acceptable
  
  To quote the author,"This delightful Passover dish must have been
  brought to Italy by the Spanish refugees nearly five hundred years
  ago, since its name and preparation are close to the Picadillo of
  Spain and south America which is usually made with beef."
  
  Break matzot directly into a shallow bowl and pour broth over them.
  In a large saucepan, place meat and oil and season with salt, pepper
  and nutmeg. Add bay leaf, sage, garlic and rosemary and saute,
  stirring frequently until meat is dark brown on all sides. (If dried
  sage is used, enclose it in the cheesecloth with the rosemary.If you
  using ground turkey, add garlic and bay leaf to this cheesecloth
  bundle). Transfer meat to a dish to cool.
  
  Remove and discard bay leaf, sage, garlic and rosemary. Add nuts to
  saucepan with oil and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain excess liquid
  from the matzot, but do not squeeze dry. Add soaked matzot to the
  saucepan and turn heat off. If using cubed turkey breast, grind it
  now and return to the saucepan. Add beaten eggs and mix thoroughly.
  Oil a 9 inch cake pan and sprinkle with matza meal. Pour meat mixture
  into it; level it with a spatula. With a small ladle, make three
  depressions near the centre and place 1 egg yolk in each depression.
  Bake in 375F oven for 1/2 hour.

  Taglioni Colla Crocia (Ruota di Faraone)
  
  To quote the author, "Tagliolini colla Crocia" is traditionally
  served on Shabbat B'shallach in all parts of Italy and is associated
  by Italian Jews with the passage of the Israelites through the Red
  Sea and their deliverance from the Egyptians although the preparation
  of it, and even the name, varies from place to place."
  
  *Anne's note: Butter or margarine may be substituted for the chicken
  fat as it is used to grease a dish.
  
  Roll out the dough not too thin and fold as you would for a jelly
  roll, 2 1/2" wide. Cut 1/6" wide slices and toss to unfold noodles.
   Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil. Add tagliolini and salt; when
  boiling resumes, cook 1 minute.
   Drain, and place in a large bowl with meat sauce and diced cold
  cuts. Toss quickly to distribute the dressing evenly.
   Place in a round oven proof baking dish, well greased with fat.* If
  using raisins and nuts, make layers, alternating pasta with a mixture
  of raisins and nuts. Bake in 350F oven for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or till
  a nice crust is formed on all sides. Invert over a serving dish and
  bring to the table.

    1/2    Chicken breast;cubed                     -Tomato sauce) or Meat Sauce
 
  To quote the author, "I suppose that the tradition of making spinach
  ravioli on Purim originated because Purim comes in the season when
  spinach is tender, flavorful and abundant. Now we can make spinach
  ravioli throughout the year, but they never taste as good as they do
  around Purim."
  
  Remove the roots and stems from spinach and save for later use. Rinse
  spinach in cold water as many times as necessary to rid it of any
  sand. Place in a pot with no water other than the water the spinach
  retains from washing. Add a pinch of salt and cook, covered for about
  5 minutes. Transfer to a colander and set aside to drain.
    Place oil, onion, carrot and chicken breast in a large skillet. Add
  1 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp pepper and cook over moderate heat for 4 to 5
  minutes longer or until most of the liquid has evaporated. Add flour
  and stir 1 more minute. Remove from heat; cool for 5 or 6 minutes,
  then chop very fine.
    Roll the dough paper thin and place over a floured board. With a
  feather brush dipped in cold water lightly brush the top to maintain
  moisture. Place mounds of spinach mixture on the dough in straight
  lines about 2 inches apart (measurements are from the centers of the
  mounds), making 8 or 9 dozen of them. Roll out the other half of the
  dough paper thin and place loosely over the sheet with the mounds.
  With an Italian pastry wheel, press along the furrows, cutting and
  sealing at the same time.
   Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil. Add ravioli and 3 Tbsp salt. Stir
  until boiling resumes. Cook 4 to 5 minutes, uncovered. Drain and
  serve with marinara or meat sauce. SERVES: 6-8

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 lb Short ribs (or chicken)             2 tb Tomato paste
      2 c  Chicken broth                       1 tb Dry mustard
      2 c  :Water, or enough to                1 ts Worcestershire sauce
           -barely cover ribs                1/4 ts Ground cloves
      1 tb Brown sugar                         1 ts Chili powder
    1/4 c  Cider vinegar                     1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/4 c  Catsup                         
 
  THE DAY BEFORE GRILLING THE RIBS, put the sugar and vinegar in a pot
  large enough to hold the ribs and place over medium heat on top of
  the stove. Cook until the vinegar reduces and forms a syrup with the
  sugar, about 8 minutes. Watch carefully, as the syrup will suddenly
  darken in color. Immediately add the broth, water, catsup, tomato
  paste, mustard, Worcestershire, cloves, chili powder and pepper and
  bring to a boil. Add the ribs and cook 20 minutes. (If using chicken,
  cook for 10 minutes.) Remove from heat, remove the ribs from the
  liquid and place covered in the refrigerator. Cook the liquid over
  medium heat until it becomes thick and syrupy. The next day, light a
  charcoal grill. Place the ribs on the grill so they are not directly
  over the coals and cover the grill so that smoke collects inside. If
  your grill does not have a cover, improvise one out of aluminium
  foil. Cook for 40 minutes, basting with barbecue sauce every 10
  minutes. When ribs are well heated, remove to a platter and serve.
  Offer any additional barbecue sauce on the side.

 Categories: Poultry, Jewish, Chicken
      Yield: 6 servings
 
MMMMM------------------CORINNE KATCHER, PMJH95A-----------------------
      2    Chickens, quartered               1/2 c  Honey
      2 lb Chopped onions (NOT A TYPO!)             Paprika
      9 oz Raisins                                  Salt
      3 oz Pine nuts                                Cloves
 
  Salt and paprika chickens. Brown in oil. In another skillet, saute
  onions until clear. Add raisins, cloves, and pine nuts; saute a few
  minutes more. Remove from heat and add honey. Adjust seasonings to
  taste. Place chicken in baking dish, cover with mixture and bake at
  325F for 1 hour or until nicely browned and tender. This recipe came
  from a Moroccan restaurant in the old quarter of Jerusalem. The
  owners generously gave us this recipe at our request -- in a mixture
  of Hebrew and Arabic with metric measurements. Many people
  contributed to the translation, and the result is worth their
  efforts. So to be faithful, you should actually use 2.2 pounds of
  onions -- 1 kilo!

MMMMM------------------------HERB BOUQUET-----------------------------
    1/2 ts Thyme; and                          6    Fresh parsley stems
    1/2    Bay leaf, and                            -(tied in cheesecloth)

MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE BISQUE----------------------------
           Salt and pepper to taste            4    Basil leaves; minced
      4 tb Cornstarch                          1 ts Tarragon, minced
      4 tb Non-fat powdered milk               1 tb Minced chives
    1/2 ts Cognac, Armagnac or brandy     
 
  SEPARATE THE TAIL from the shrimp and remove the meat, reserving all
  shells, claws, heads and so forth. If you wish, devein the tails, then
  cover and refrigerate. Coarsely chop the heads and shells, reserving 4
  heads for decoration, if you have them. In a large saucepan, heat the
  oil over moderate heat, then add the shrimp shells and cook them.
  Stir slowly but continuously for 5 minutes. Add the vegetables and
  tomato puree and cook another 5 minutes, stirring. Add the wine and
  bring to the boil for 30 seconds, scraping the bottom to dissolve any
  coagulated juices. Add the water, bouillon cube, saffron and herb
  bouquet. Return to a simmer and cook, covered, for 1 hour. Pour the
  stock through a fine strainer into a bowl, pressing down on the
  vegetables and shrimp shells with a soup ladle to extract all of the
  liquid. (For a finer result, strain again through cheesecloth.)
  Return the stock to the boil. Moisten the cornstarch in a little cold
  water, then add it to the saucepan and boil for 4 minutes. Taste for
  salt and pepper. (The recipe can be prepared ahead to this point and
  refrigerated.) Bring the stock to a simmer. Add the shrimp tails and
  let them cook a bare 2 minutes (for small or medium), or 3 minutes
  for extra large. Remove immediately with a slotted spoon and divide
  them among 4 heated soup plates. Pour the stock into a blender, add
  the powdered milk and cognac. Blend until smooth and homogeneous.
  Pour immediately into the soup plates over the shrimp tails. Garnish
  each dish with an equal amount of the herbs and a shrimp head
  (optional).
  
  This rich-tasting bisque has only 90 calories per serving.

      2    Oranges                             4 tb Corn oil
 
    1. Make the stuffing for the turkey.
    2. Wash the turkey well, inspecting for pinfeathers, and chop off
  the wing tips, reserving them for later use with giblets in gravy or
  stock. Dry the turkey inside and out with a kitchen towel.
    3. Slice oranges in half. Squeeze the juice all over the outside of
  the bird and rub into the cavity to refreshen. Salt and pepper the
  cavity to taste. Fill the turkey with the stuffing, not packing too
  tightly. Sew up the cavity or close with small trussing skewers.
    4. Rub the outside of the turkey all over with 1 1/2 sticks of
  softened butter and sprinkle generously with salt, pepper and
  paprika. Drape the turkey with cheesecloth.
    5. Place turkey, breast side up, on a rack in a roasting pan.
    6. Four to five hours before serving is scheduled, place the turkey
  in a preheated 325 oven.
    7. Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter with 4 tablespoons of
  corn oil in a saucepan. Lift the cheesecloth from the turkey and
  baste every 30 minutes, first with the butter and oil mixture and
  later with the turkey's own juices.*
    8. Roast for 3 to 4 hours or until the thigh juices run clear
  yellow when pricked with a skewer. There should be no traces of
  pinkness. The drumstick will move easily in the socket when the
  turkey is done.
    9. When the turkey is done, remove to a heated platter and cover
  with foil. The turkey should stand 30 minutes before carving.
   10. Remove stuffing into a bowl. If there is any additional from the
  recipe, bake it in a covered cassarole in a 350 oven, covered with
  foil, for one half hour before serving.
   11. Serve the turkey on a large platter. Be sure you have sharp
  knives and a good carver among the group. Enjoy!
    *For a moist bird, frequent basting is essential, so don't forget!
  Baste every 30 minutes---breast and legs should be a lovely golden
  color.

      2 lg Carrots; coarsely chopped         1/8 ts Ground nutmeg
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F. Rinse the chicken pieces dry, pat dry and
  sprinkle with salt and pepper. Melt the butter over low heat in a
  large covered casserole dish or Dutch oven on top of the stove. Add
  the chicken pieces and cook on all sides without browning, about 7
  minutes. The chicken should not be crowded, so perform this operation
  in batches, if necessary. Remove pieces to a plate as they are done.
  When all chicken is done, add the onions, carrots, celery, bay leaves
  and thyme and cook about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the
  vegetables and cook, stirring for 30 seconds. Add the stock, milk and
  nutmeg. Increase heat to high, cover and bring to a boil. Replace the
  thighs and drumsticks, cover and place casserole in the oven for 25
  minutes. Add the reserved breasts and cook for another 15 minutes.
  Remove the casserole from the oven, remove the chicken pieces from
  the casserole and set them aside. Strain the sauce through a fine
  sieve and discard onions, carrots, celery and herbs. Keep the chicken
  pieces warm in the turned-off oven while finishing the sauce. Place
  strained sauce in a medium saucepan over medium heat and cook until
  stewing liquid is thick enough to cling to a wooden spoon. To serve,
  arrange the chicken in a serving casserole or on a deep serving
  platter and ladle the sauce over it. Accompany the fricassee with
  noodles or rice pilaf. Refrigerate the meat and sauce separately for
  up to 3 days. Freeze the meat and sauce separately in 2 batches for
  up to 3 months.

  oven-proof frying pan over medium heat on the stove and add the
  sweetbreads. Cook until they are dark golden on both sides, about 5
  minutes per side. Do not crowd the pan or they won't brown. Tilt the
  pan and pour off any remaining oil and add the shallots, wine and
  broth and bring to a boil. Cover the skillet and transfer to the
  oven. Turn temperature to 325F and cook 35 minutes, turning once.
  Remove pan from oven and use a slotted spoon to transfer the
  sweetbreads to a platter. Add the cream to the cooking juices and
  quickly boil the liquid until it starts to become sauce-like, about
  10 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter. When it's
  time for dinner, strain the sauce over the sweetbreads; decorate with
  slices of lemon.

  under the skin of each breast, dredge each breast in flour and shake
  off the excess. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat on
  the stove. When the oil is hot enough for frying (350F), dip each
  breast in the beer batter and let the excess run off. Place skin-side
  down in the oil and fry until golden. Turn and fry other side, about
  1 minute per side. Remove breasts from the oil as they are done,
  drain on paper towels and transfer to a baking dish. Place the
  chicken breasts in a preheated 375F oven for 15 minutes. Place tomato
  sauce in a saucepan and reheat. (If the mixture is too thin, place it
  in a saucepan over high heat and boil down.) Pour the sauce onto a
  platter and arrange the chicken breasts on top.

    1/2 ts Lemon juice                              -Madeira may be substituted
    1/4 ts Salt                                1 tb Butter
      1 c  Heavy cream                       1/4 c  Cognac or a good brandy
    1/2 tb Cornstarch; blended with       
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 425F. Truss the chicken, then dry the outside
  thoroughly and rub with 1 tablespoon butter all over the skin.
  
  TO BROWN THE CHICKEN: Set the chicken on a rack, breast side up in the
  roasting pan, place in the oven for 5 minutes. Turn on its left side
  and baste quickly with butter, return to the oven for another 5
  minutes. Turn on its right side for another 5 minutes, basting as
  before.
  
  TO ROAST THE CHICKEN: Leave the chicken on its right side. Reduce oven
  temperature to 350F. Leave it for a total of 15-20 minutes, basting
  it at least every 10 minutes. Salt the chicken, turn it on its other
  side, and cook another 15-20 minutes, basting at least every 20
  minutes. Turn the chicken breast up and continue basting every 10
  minutes during the last few minutes it is roasting.
  
  TO TELL IF THE CHICKEN IS DONE: Prick the thickest part of the
  drumstick with a fork. If the juices come out clear yellow, it is
  done. If not, roast another 5 minutes and test again. As a final
  check, lift the chicken and drain the juices from its vent into the
  pan; if the last few drops are clear yellow, it is definitely done.
  Put the chicken on a warm platter, remove the trussing string, and
  let it sit at least 5-10 minutes before carving so that the juices
  will not retreat into the tissues. It can wait a good 30 minutes with
  foil over it. As the chicken roasts, wipe the mushrooms clean with a
  paper towel, cut off the ends and slice them; if small, leave whole.
  Bring 1/4 cup water to a boil with 1/2 tablespoon butter, lemon juice
  and salt. Add mushrooms, cover and cook for 8 minutes. Separate the
  cooking liquid and save it. Pour the cream and cornstarch and cream
  mixture into the mushrooms. Simmer for 2 minutes. Taste and correct
  seasoning and hold. When the chicken is done, remove it to its
  platter and remove all but 2 table- spoons of fat from the pan. Stir
  in the shallots and saute for 1 minute. Add the port and mushroom
  juices and reduce rapidly while deglazing the pan (scraping up the
  coagulated juices) until the liquid has reduced to about 1/4 cup. Add
  the mushrooms and cream. Simmer for 2-3 minutes, allowing the liquid
  to thicken slightly. Taste and correct seasoning; add more lemon
  juice to taste. Butter the inside of a casserole with butter; rapidly
  carve the chicken into serving pieces and sprinkle lightly with salt.
  Arrange it in the casserole for serving. Warm the cognac carefully,
  do not let it catch on fire. Set the chicken over moderate heat until
  you hear it begin to sizzle; pour the cognac over it and ignite it
  carefully with a match. Shake the casserole slowly till the flames
  have subsided. Pour the mushroom mixture over the casserole, basting
  the chicken. Cover and let it steep for 5 minutes. Do not allow the
  sauce to boil. Serve immediately.

      2 lb Coarse (kosher) salt              1/2 ts Fine salt
    1/4 lb Unsalted butter                   1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
      3 tb Olive oil                       3 1/2 c  Chicken stock
      2 x  Large cloves garlic, minced         2 x  Large egg yolks
 
  Remove giblets from turkey and reserve for another use.  Wash turkey
  and pat dry.  Fill neck and body cavities with coarse salt, then rub
  skin well all over with salt.  Place turkey and any remainng coarse
  salt in large deep kettle, adding enough cold water just to cover
  bird. Set in cool spot 3 to 4 hours.
  
  To prepare stuffing, place butter and olive oil in large, heavy saute
  pan or kettle, and set over moderate heat.  When butter is melted,
  add garlic and cook 3 to 5 minutes until tender.

  smooth. Remove from heat and reserve.
  
  Drain turkey and rinse several times in cool water so all traces of
  salt wash away.  Place bird on counter with neck cavity facing up.
  With hands, begin working skin free from breast.  Proceed gently,
  taking care not to tear skin.  Loosen skin down both sides of bird to
  within 1 inch of tail end.
  
  With hands, push stuffing bit by bit under skin.  Continue packing
  stuffing in lightly, until breast is covered with about 1-inch layer.
  Next, fill neck cavitiy.  Skewer neck skin flat against back to
  enclose and truss bird.

  Drain drippings into sauceboat and keep warm.  Remove trussing string
  and skewers and serve turkey at once on warmed platter.

      Title: Clay Pot Shrimp with Bean Thread Noodles - Goong Ope Maw 
 Categories: Thai, Seafood, Pasta
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      8 oz Bean Thread Noodles                 1 tb Oyster Sauce
      2 tb Vegetable Oil                       1 tb Chinese Rice Wine Or:
    1/4 c  Cilantro Pesto (See Recipe)              Dry Sherry
      1 tb Fresh Ginger, Finely Chopped        1 ts Dark Soy Sauce
      1 lb Shrimp, Peeled & Deveined           1 ts Asian Sesame Oil
    1/3 c  Coarsely Chopped Green Onion        1 ts Sugar
    1/4 c  Chicken Stock                     1/4 ts Salt
      2 tb Fish Sauce (Nam Pla)                     Handful Of Cilantro Leaves

MMMMM-----------------------CILANTRO PESTO----------------------------
      1 ts Whole White Or Black                     Cilantro Roots Or Leaves
           Peppercorns                              And Stems
      2 tb Coarsely Chopped Fresh              2 tb Coarsely Chopped Garlic
 
  CILANTRO PESTO:  Using a mortor and pestle or a spice grinder, crush
  or grind the peppercorns to a fine powder.  Combine the pepper,
  cilantro roots and garlic; work the three inngredients innto a fairly
  smooth paste in the mortor or in a small blender or food processor.
  If you use a blender or food processor, you may need to add a little
  vegetable oil or water to ease the grinding.  Make about 1/4 cup.
  For an industrial strength batch use 1 tb peppercorns, 1/2 cup
  cilantro roots and 1/2 cup garlic. To store the pesto for later use,
  put in a glass jar, pour a little oil onto the surface to cover it
  and seal tightly.  It will keep nicely for about 1 week in the
  refrigerator.
  
  CLAY POT SHRIMP:  Place the noodles in a large bowl and add warm
  water to cover.  Soak the noodles until they become limp and white,
  about 15 minutes.  Drain and set aside.  You should have about 5 cups
  softened noodles.  In a large clay pot or flameproof, heavy-bottomed
  casserole, heat the oil over medium heat until hot, about 1 minute.
  Add the pesto and stir-fry until fragrant, about 1 minute, adding a
  little more oil if it sticks or burns.  Add the ginger and shrimp and
  stir-fry for 1 minute. Toss in the green onion, turning the mixture
  once more.  Transfer the shrimp to a plate and set aside while you
  prepare the noodles and sauce. In a small bowl, combine the chicken
  stock, fish sauce (Nam Pla), oyster sauce, rice wine, soy sauce,
  sesame oil, sugar and salt; stir to mix well. Place the soaked
  noodles in the clay pot in which you cooked the shrimp mixture.
  Scrape the shrimp mixture over the noodles and pour in the chicken
  stock mixture.  Toss the noodles and shrimp a little to combine them
  with the sauce, then cover the pot tightly.  Place the clay pot over
  medium heat and cook until the noodles are soft and clear and the
  shrimp is done, about 10 minutes.  Sprinkle with the cilantro leaves
  and serve at once. From: Real Thai, The Best Of Thailand's Regional

  Two to three days before serving, wipe the meat with a damp cloth,
  then place in a large plastic bag.  In a large bowl, thoroughly
  combine vinegar, Coca-Cola, water,onions, celery, carrots, pepper,
  cloves, bay leaves, sugar and salt; pour over meat.  Fasten bag
  tightly and lay flat in a 9" X 13" pan.  Refrigerate, turning bag
  each day. (If you like sour sauerbraten, let marinate for 4 days.)
  When ready to cook, remove meat (saving marinade) and dry well.  Rub
  the surface lightly with flour.  In a Dutch oven, heat oil and slowly
  brown the meat well on all sides.  Add 1 cup of the marinade liquid
  plus some of the vegetables and bay leaves. Cover tightly and simmer
  on surface heat or in a preheated 350oF oven for 3 to 4 hours until
  the meat is fork tender.  If needed, add more marinade during the
  cooking time to keep at least 1/2 inch liquid in the Dutch oven.
  Remove the meat and keep warm until ready to slice.  Into a large
  measuring cup, strain the drippings.  Add several ice cubes and let
  stand for a few minutes until the fat separates out.  Remove the fat,
  then make the gravy. TO MAKE THE GRAVY: In the Dutch oven, combine
  the gravy ingredients, stir and cook for about 5 minutes over medium
  heat until gravy has thickened. Taste for seasonings and adjust if
  necessary.  This makes about 3 cups of gravy. From: "International

     10    Chicken wings (yield 20           1/3 c  Cornstarch--mixed with:
           "Drumsticks)                        1 ts Baking powder
      1    Egg white, slightly beaten               Peanut oil for deep frying

MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
      1 ts Five-spice powder                 1/2 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts MSG (optional)                      1 ts Rice wine
      1 ts Salt                                1 ts Soy sauce
 
  Discard wing tips.  Cut between joints.  Remove the smaller bone of
  the lower wing.  Cut skin loose around the small end and push skin
  and meat up to form drumstick.
  
  Marinate wings for 1 hour.  Add egg white.  Coat wings evenly.
  (Using egg white to coat the wings will help to seal the juice inside
  the meat. Hence the meat will be juicier.
  
  Dredge wings in cornstarch mixture.  (Using cornstarch and baking
  powder helps to make the outside layer crisp.)
  
  Deep-fry for 3 minutes.  Drain.  Let cool.
  
  Deep-fry once again right before serving.  (Deep-fry the first time
  to cook the meat and seal the juice in the meat.  The second time to
  make the outside crisp.  Make sure the oil is very hot before you
  deep-fry for the second time.)

  dough. Lightly oil the ball and flatten it into a thin 3 1/2-inch
  circle. An oiled Chinese cleaver is traditionally used; however, a
  tortilla press or a rolling pin works.  Put 1 large teaspoon of
  filling in the center of the circle.  Fold it in half and pinch the
  edges to seal the filling inside. Repeat with remaining dough and
  filling.
  
  Place dumplings without touching each other on a lightly oiled bamboo
  steamer (or a heat resistant plate).  Steam over boiling water for 3
  minutes.  Serve hot, dipped in light soy sauce and Chinese mustard.
  Serve with Chinese Mustard, for dipping.
  
  Makes 2 1/2 dozen dumplings.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 c  Raw peanuts                         1 tb Minced ginger root
      3 c  Peanut oil                        1/2 c  Chicken stock
      2    Whole chicken breasts at          1/2 tb Sesame oil
           -room temp.                       1/2 tb Chinese red vingear
      1 lg Egg white                         1/2 tb Dark soy sauce
  1 1/2 tb Water chestnut flour            1 1/2 ts (level) chili paste with
           SAUCE:                                   -garlic

      2 lg Cloves garlic                       1 pn Sugar
 
  cornstarch paste
  
  Preparation:  Trim ends off green onions and cut light green and
  white part into 1" sections.  Mix all other sauce ingredients in
  2-quart saucepan. Reserve.
  
  Pull skin off breasts, then pull chicken meat from bones.  Slice meat
  into 1" strips, then crosswise to make 1" chunks.  In bowl large
  enough to hold chicken, add egg white to water chestnut flour.  Beat
  mixture with a single chopstick (not an egg beater or whisk).  Stir
  chicken pieces into egg mixture to coat thoroughly.  Marinate 5
  minutes.  Note: water chestnut flour gives a lighter crust than
  cornstarch, though the latter may be substituted.
  
  Deep-frying:  Heat cooking oil in wok or deep-fryer to medium heat
  (you'll need more oil for deep-fryer).  Fry peanuts until they are a
  light tan color; if a test peanut browns quickly, turn down heat.
  Remove peanuts with strainer or slotted spoon; drain on paper towel
  or paper bag. Reserve.
  
  Turn up heat slightly for chicken.  Test a chunk first:  chicken
  should raise to surface immediately & brown in about 2 minutes.
  Deep-fry coated chicken chunks until golden brown.  Deep-fry no more
  than 8 chunks at a time. Use long chopsticks or spatula to keep
  pieces separate while they are frying.  Remove with long chopsticks
  or slotted spoon. Reserve.
  
  Sauce:  While deep-frying chicken, heat sauce to simmer.  Add green
  onions & peanuts about a minute before serving.  At the last minute,
  add chicken pieces to sauce, mix quickly & serve.

           - use canned but squeeze dry  

MMMMM-------------------------SEASONING------------------------------
    1/2 ts Salt                                2 ts Thin soy sauce
      1 ts Sugar                               1 ts Oyster sauce
      1 tb Sesame oi                           1 tb Cornstarch
 
  Shell, devein, wash, and drain prawns.  Dice into bits.
  
  Boil mushrooms in water for 10 minutes, rinse, squeeze dry, cut off
  and discard stems; then chop into very small pieces.
  
  Combine the pork, mushrooms, prawns, and onion.  Put mixture on
  chopping board and chop 10 to 15 strokes with cleaver.  (Use a sharp
  knife if you don't have a cleaver.)  Texture, when you're finished,
  should be slightly finer than hamburger.
  
  Add "seasoning" and the egg to the pork mixture.  Mix well.
  
  To make dumpling, place 1 Tb filling in the center of a dumpling
  skin. Then bring all sides of the skin up to cover the meat as much
  as possible, without closing.  The top of the dumpling is left open.
  
  Cook dumplings by steaming for 30 minutes.  Use as many as you need,
  with the rest, cool, wrap, freeze.  Reheat after thawing by steaming
  10 minutes.
  
  Serve with soy sauce, hot sauce, or mustard.
  
  *  Dumpling skins are similar to won ton skins, except that they are
  round and slightly thinner.  You may substitute won ton skins by
  merely cutting off the corners to round off the skin.

      1 lb Chinese noodles (not canned)        1 ts Hot chili oil (or to taste)
  3 1/2 tb Dark brown sesame oil               6    Green onions, sliced finely
  3 1/2 tb Soy sauce                                - on the bias, divided
      2 tb Rice vinegar                             Black sesame seeds, optional
      2 tb Granulated sugar (or to                  Fresh cilantro, oprional
           - taste)                          1/4 c  BBQ pork, optional
 
  Bring a generous amount of unsalted water to a boil.  Add the noodles
  (all at once) for approximately 2 minutes, or until al dente (toothy
  but firm). Use chopsticks or two wooden spoons to separate noodles as
  they cook.  Do not overcook.
  
  Empty noodles into a large colander, then immediately flush with cold
  running water until cool.  Shake off excess water and drain for 15 to
  30 minutes.
  
  Combine sesame oil, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar and chili oil; mix
  well. Pour over noodles and use your hands to evenly distribute
  seasoned sauce. Work carefully so noodles don[t break.  Gently spread
  sauce over each strand and allow the noodles to fully absorb sauce
  before eating.
  
  Add all onions except 2 tablespoons.  Toss and mix to evenly
  distribute the onions.  Garnish with remaining onions, sesame seeds
  and cilantro, if desired.
  
  Noodles taste best if they are allowed to sit and the flavors meld
  for a few hours before serving.
  
  Serve refrigerated and cold, or at room temperature.

  13/16 c  Plain flour                     1 1/3    Eggs
           Pinch of salt                     1/3    Egg

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
    1/3 ts Vegetable oil                    3/16 c  Malt vinegar
    1/3 sm Red chilli                       1/16 c  Cashew paste
    1/3    Spring onion                      1/3 tb Lime juice
 83 1/3 g  Snow peas                         1/3 ts Lime rind
   3/16 ts Sesame oil                        1/3    Red Chilli
   1/16 c  Light soy sauce                  3/16 c  Roasted Cashews
 
  Preparation: Lightly beat the eggs (keep the 4 and the 1 separate)
  
  Finely chop one of the chillis, and the spring onion. Thinly slice
  the snow peas. Finely shred the lime rind and the second red chilli.
  
  As an alternative to making your own noodles, chinese thread noodles
  are a suitable (but not as nice!) substitute, as is tagliatelle.
  
  1. To make the noodles sift the flour and salt into a bowl.
     Make a well in the centre and add the 4 beaten eggs, gradually
     importing into the flour with a fork. Turn onto a lightly
     floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic (about 5
     minutes). Cover and stand for 30 minutes.
  
  2. Divide the dough into 4 portions. Cover with a tea towel. Roll one
     portion of the dough to 3mm thickness using a rolling pin or sharp
     knife. Roll up the sheet of pasta completely and cut into 5mm wide
     strips. Carefully unroll the strands.
  
     Repeat the process with the remaining portions of dough. Spread
  onto
     a dry tea towel and sprinkle with plain flour. Set aside.
  
  3. Prepare the sauce whilst the pasta is standing. Heat the oil in a
  pan
     and add the chilli, spring onion and snow peas. Cook over a low
  heat
     for 2-3 minutes. Add the sesame oil , soy sauce, vinegar, cashew
  paste,
     lime juice and rind. Stir to combine. Cook, stirring, over a gentle
     heat for 3-4 minutes.
  
  4. Cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling water until just tender.
     Drain, spoon over the sauce and toss to combine. Sprinkle over
     shredded chilli, cashews and serve.

      Title: Aromatic Duck
 Categories: Poultry, Chinese, Main dish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Duckling                            1 tb Kosher salt
      2 ts Peppercorns                         1 tb Sugar, brown
      1 ts Thyme, whole dried                  1 tb Brandy
      2    Bay leaf; crumbled                  1    Garlic clove
      6    Cloves                              5    Red cabbage leaves
 
  Cut off the wingtips from the duck and wrap them up with the giblets
  for making stock.  Pull out and discard any loose interior fat.
  Rinse the duck inside and out and pat dry, inside and out. Mix
  together in a spice mill or mortar the peppercorns, thyme, bay
  leaves, cloves and salt. Grind to a fine texture.  Combine in a small
  dish with the brown sugar and brandy. Place the duck in a heavy
  plastic bag that fits snugly. Rub half the spice mixture inside the
  duck and the remaining half over the outside. Place the garlic in the
  duck's cavity. Close the bag tightly and refrigerate 24 hours,
  rubbing the surface and squeezing in the spices occasionally. Remove
  the duck from the bag and gently pat it dry.  Set it on a cake rack
  over a plate and return it, uncovered, to the refrigerator for
  another 24 hours or so, turning it once. Pat the duck to dry it
  thoroughly (if not already dry) and let it come to room temperature
  (at least two hours). Preheat the oven to 300. Using a large needle
  and white cotton thread, sew closed the neck and tail openings.
  Place the duck on its side on a rack set in a roasting pan. Roast the
  duck for 45 minutes. With the needle, prick the fatty parts on the
  upper side; do not prick deeply enough to pierce the flesh. Grab the
  duck by the legs and turn it over onto the other side. Increase the
  oven temperature to 350 and roast 30 minutes.  Price the fatty parts
  on the upturned side and then turn the duck onto its breast. Increase
  the heat to 400 and roast about 30 minutes longer, or until the duck
  is deeply browned and most of the fat has melted away. Remove from
  the oven and let cool 1 to 3 hours before serving. To serve: Using a
  heavy cleaver or poultry shears, cut through flesh and bone of the
  duck carefully to make about 12 to 14 serving pieces, keeping the
  skin neatly intact on each piece. Spread the cabbage leaves over a
  platter, shallow basket or wooden bowl and arrange the duck on them.
  If the duck is to be served hot, arrange the cut pieces in a pan in a
  single layer, cut side down, and roast in a preheated 350 oven 15
  minutes.

  Wipe the wok clean, reheat, and add 1 tablespoon oil. Then add the
  garlic and ginger, and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Then add the rest of
  the ingredients except the cornstarch mixture and sesame oil. Bring

      Yield: 1 servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Flour *                             1 ts Chopped ginger
      1 c  Water *                             1 tb Tientsin Preserved Vegetable
      2 oz Cabbage (1/2 cup cooked and              - rinsed and chopped
           - chopped)                          2 tb Oil
    1/2 lb Lean ground pork                    1 c  Chicken stock
      1    Green onion, chopped          

MMMMM-------------------------SEASONING------------------------------
    1/4 ts Salt                                1 ts White wine
    1/4 ts Sugar                                    Dash of pepper
      1 ts Thin soy sauce                      2 ts Cornstarch
      1 ts Oyster sauce                  

MMMMM----------------------------DIP---------------------------------
      2 ts Thin soy sauce                      1 ts White Vinegar
      1 ts Hot spiced oil                 
 
  Combine flour and cold water in large mixing bowl.  Mix thoroughly to
  form dough.  Cover with damp cloth; let stand for 20 minutes. *
  
  Cook cabbage 2 minutes in boiling water.  Rinse in cold water, and
  drain. Squeeze dry of all excess moisture.  Chop fine; set aside.
  
  Place the ground pork, chopped green onion, chopped ginger, and
  preserved vegetables together on chopping board.  Mix and chop with
  the clever for approximately 15 strokes.
  
  Add "seasoning" and the cabbage to the pork mixture and mix
  thoroughly.
  
  After dough has set for 20 minutes, knead it for 1 minute and then
  form into 2 to 3 rolls, approximately 1-1/2 inch in diameter.  Cut
  each roll of dough into slice 1-1/2 inch thick.
  
  With a small rolling pin, or heel of hand, flatten each piece of
  dough into a thin patty, 3 inch in diameter.  Place 1/4 tablespoon of
  the pork mixture in the center of each patty.  Fold in half, and seal
  the edges by pressing firmly together with your fingers.  (Help
  ready-made skins to seal by applying egg white to the edges.)
  
  Set each pot sticker with the straight edge on a platter, pressing
  firmly so as to form a flat base.  Each pot sticker should be made to
  stand upright, rather than allowed to rest flat on its side.
  
  Heat frying pan and add 2 tablespoon oil.  On medium heat, pan-fry pot
  stickers.  Cook on the base surface only.  Pan-fry 2 minutes, until
  the base side is nicely browned.
  
  Add 1 cup chicken stock to the pot stickers.  Cover and cook over
  medium heat for approximately 7 minutes, until most of the chicken
  stock is absorbed.  Remove to platter.
  
  Mix thin soy sauce, hot spiced oil, and white vinegar to use as
  condiment for Pot Stickers.
  
  * Pot sticker skins can be purchased at Chinese groceries.

      1    Peameal Bacon, 1 centre cut              -piece
 
  "Peameal bacon is a unique Canadian meat, pickled but unsmoked loin
  of pork rolled in cornmeal. Usually it is sliced and fried for
  breakfast but it excellent baked whole. The cornmeal makes a crisp
  exterior and the meat, although quite lean, is particularly juicy,
  because of the pickling process. For baking it is important to select
  a piece from the centre cut, with a wide band of lean visible on both
  ends."
  
  Place in an open roasting pan, fat side up. Bake at 350F degrees for
  1- 1/2 hours. Serve hot in generous slices with baked beans if

    1/2 c  All purpose flour                   2 tb Butter, melted

      2 ts Baking powder                  
 
  "Bannock, a simple type of scone was cooked in pioneer days over open
  fires. Variations in flours and the additional of dried or fresh
  fruit make this bread the simple choice of Canadian campers even
  today.  Oven baking has become an acceptable alternative to the cast
  iron frypan. McKelvie's restaurant in Halifax serves an oatmeal
  version similar to this one. For plain bannock, omit rolled oats and
  increase the all purpose flour to 1 cup.... One of the earliest quick
  breads, bannock was as simple as flour, salt, a bit of fat (often
  bacon grease) and water. In gold rush days, dough was mixed right in
  the prospector's flour bag and cooked in a frypan over an open fire.
   Indians wrapped a similar dough around sticks driven into the ground
  beside their camp fire, baking it along with freshly caught fish.
  Today's native _Fried Bread_ is like bannock and cooked in a skillet.
     Newfoundlander's _Damper Dogs_ are small rounds of dough cooked on
  the stove's dampers while _Toutons_ are similar bits of dough deep
  fried. At a promotional luncheon for the 1992 Inuit Circumpolar
  Conference, Eskimo Doughnuts, deep fried rings of bannock dough, were
  served. It is said that Inuit children prefer these "doughnuts" to
  sweet cookies.
     Red River settlers from Scotland made a frugal bannock with lots of
  flour, little sugar and drippings or lard. Now this same bread plays a
  prominent part in Winnipeg's own Folklorama Festival.
     At Expo '86 in Vancouver, buffalo on bannock buns was a popular
  item at the North West Territories ' restaurant. In many regions of
  Canada, whole wheat flour or wheat germ replaces part of the flour
  and cranberries or blueberries are sometimes added. A Saskatchewan
  firm markets a bannock mix, and recipe books from coast to coast
  upgrade bannock with butter, oatmeal, raisins, cornmeal and dried
  fruit."
  
  Stir together flours, oats, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add melted
  butter, raisins (if using) and water, adding more water if needed to
  make sticky dough. With floured hands, pat into greased pie plate.
  Bake in 400F oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until browned and tester
  comes out clean. Cut into wedges. SERVES:6 VARIATIONS: In place of
  raisins add chopped dried apricots or fresh berries.(Blueberries are
  terrific if one is camping in northern Ontario in August.)

  "Blood pudding is one of the great delicacies of Acadian cuisine. It
  used to be that every Acadian family made its own. Since the annual
  slaughter came during Advent, the boudin was usually saved for the
  Christmas holidays." Also part of Cajun cuisine,
  
  Sauce a boudin When slaughtering a pig, collect the fresh blood,
  immediately add salt and stir to prevent coagulation. Cut the fresh
  pork, the lung, heart and neck into large pieces. Place the meat into
  a large pot and add just water to cover the meat. Add the salt and 3
  chopped onions. Simmer on medium heat for 3 hours. Remove the meat
  from the cooking liquid and let it cool. Cut the meat into very small
  pieces or grind it with a meat grinder. Add the meat to the cooking
  liquid with the 2 remaining onions, pepper and spices. Bring the
  liquid to a boil and slowly add the blood by pouring it through a
  sieve. Stir constantly. Add the flour, mixed with a small amounts of
  water. (The flour may be browned in the oven before being add to the
  meat, provided that slightly more flour is used.) Simmer the mixture
  on low heat for approximately 1 hour, stirring frequently. This sauce
  may served later by warming in a skillet.
  
  Boudin des Branches (Blood Pudding Sausages) To make blood pudding
  sausages, prepare blood pudding sauce but do not simmer for the last
  half hour. Rather, clean the small intestines of the pig, cut them
  into 20 inch pieces at tie them at one end. Using a funnel or a piece
  of birch bark as was the Acadian tradition, fill the intestinal
  lining with the sauce until the intestine is three quarters full.
  press out the air and tie the other end, leaving some space for
  expansion. Put the branches (sausages) in boiling water and cook for
  45 to 1 hour.

  "These tarts were the basis for Butter Tart Pie and Butter Tart

  syrup instead of corn syrup. ...Butter Tarts are uniquely Canadian.
  There are theories whether they were adapted from southern pecan pie,
  old-fashioned sugar pies, or maple syrup, backwoods or vinegar pies.
  Squabbles arise whether or not the tarts should be runny or not, and
  just how runny. Opinions differ about the use of syrup or sugar only,
  eggs beaten or not, currants or raisins, and how the tart pans should
  be filled."

      2 ts Baking powder                 

MMMMM----------------------SAVORY VARIATION---------------------------
      2 c  Oatmeal; scotch type*             1/4 ts -Salt
      1 c  Flour;all purpose                 1/3 c  Shortening; or lard or

      2 ts Baking powder                     1/4 c  -Cold water
 
  Anne's note: I prefer the savory version as it is closer to the
  original Scottish version ; my grandmother in Nova Scotia uses
  'pinhead' oatmeal, a fine grind of oatmeal sold in the Maritimes,
  "Ogilivy's" is the most popular brand there. Processing the oats in a
  food processor for a few seconds should help.
  
  "If desired process the oats in a food processor for 10 seconds to
  get a finer texture...The original recipe for oatcakes likely arrived
  with Scottish settlers in Nova Scotia. Fine oatmeal ground in the
  pioneer's gristmills, a little fat worked with fingertips, and
  perhaps a touch of sugar, made a crispy baked "cake" to eat with
  cheese or jam. Over the years, Cape Bretoners (and eventually all
  cooks across Canada) used rolled oats and more sugar to make a
  cookie-like oatcake. The Glenghorm Resort in Angonish, Nova Scotia,
  prints a recipe for these regional favorites on its postcards.
  Trilibys, a British version, richer and filled with a cooked date
  mixture, lead to the Date Sandwich Cookies so popular in Canada over
  the years."
  
  Sweet version: Stir together flour, oats, sugar, baking powder and
  salt; rub in shortening with fingertips. Mix in water with fork,
  until ball forms; divide in half.
    On a floured surface, roll out each half to 1/4 inch (5 mm)
  thickness. Cut into 2 1/2 inch (6 squares), then into triangles. Bake
  on lightly greased baking sheets in 350F oven for 15 minutes or till
  lightly browned. Transfer to racks to cool. MAKES: 60
  
  Savory Variation: (to serve with cheese) Mix 2 cups Scotch-type
  oatmeal, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 2 tsp each granulated sugar and
  baking powder, and 1/4 tsp salt. Work in 1/3 cup shortening, lard or
  bacon fat. Add 1/4 cup cold water. Proceed as above.

   In this recipe Quebec snow crab is combined with brocolli,
  oven-poached and served on a sauce, nouveau cuisine fashion. This
  appetizer is the creation of Chef Denis Pelletier of Moulin de St.
  Laurent, a contemporary French restaurant located in an old stone
  mill in the village of St. Laurent on Ile d'Orleans. Ramekins can be
  filled ahead and oven poached at the last minute, or you can reheat
  the cooked flan in a microwave oven for about 2 minutes at Medium (50
  percent).
  
    Cook brocolli florets in boiling salted water just until
  tender-crisp; drain. Generously brush 6 to 8 ramekin or custard cups
  with melted butter.
    Divide crab meat with brocolli among the ramekins. In a bowl, whisk
  together the eggs, cream and milk; season with salt, pepper and
  nutmeg. Fill ramekins three-quarters full with the custard and set in
  a shallow pan of hot water. Oven poach for 1 hour at 325F or until
  set. (A knife inserted in centre should come out clean.)
    Make Lemon Butter Sauce and pour onto 6 to 8 serving plates. Run a
  knife around the edge of each ramekin and unmold onto sauce.
  
  Lemon Butter Sauce:
    In small saucepan, heat wine and chopped shallot. Bring to a boil
  and reduce over medium-high heat until only 2 tablespoons of liquid
  remain. Reduce heat to low and whisk in butter, a few pieces at a
  time, until sauce is smooth and all the butter is incorporated. Whisk
  in cream and lemon juice. Keep warm in the top of a double boiler set
  over hot water until serving time. MAKES: about 1 1/2 CUPS SAUCE

  inside and often used to predict the future of those who found them.
  Moreover, since eggs were often scarce this time of year as a
  substitute with spectacular results. Hence some Acadians still
  describe a snowfall as "being enough to make crepes with." This
  recipe is always called Crepes a la neige, even when eggs are used
  instead of snow."

  "Newfoundland Pea Soup is very similar, but usually includes more
  vegetables such as diced turnips and carrots, and is often topped with
  small dumplings. This soup is very good reheated.. The most authentic
  version of Quebec's soupe aux pois use whole yellow peas, with salt
  pork and herbs for flavour. After cooking, the pork is usually
  chopped and returned to the soup, or sometimes removed to slice
  thinly and served separately. Instead of fresh or dried herbs, herbes
  salees (herbs preserved with salt) are often used; they are available
  commercially or made at home.
    Pea soup remains a popular dish in restaurants where tourists enjoy
  a true taste of old Quebec. In some variations, a little garlic,
  leeks, other vegetables or a ham bone are added for flavour. For a
  thicker consistency (though this is not traditional) a cup or two of
  cooked peas can be pureed then returned to the soup."
  
  Wash and sort peas; soak in cold water overnight. Drain and place in a
  large pot; add water, parsley, salt pork, onion, celery, carrots,
  parsley, bay leaf, savory and 1 tsp salt. Bring to a boil; reduce
  heat and simmer until peas are very tender, about 2 hours, adding
  more water if needed. Remove salt pork; chop and return to soup.
  Discard bay leaf. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

  "If there was one dish that could be called typically Acadian, it
  would certainly be Fricot, a soup containing potatoes and meat. The
  dish has been a long time favorite in Acadian households, so much
  that the word fricot was once synomous with a good meal and a common
  call for dinner was often, "Vous etes invites au fricot!"... This
  potato fricot was prepared when neither meat nor fish were available,
  and given the tongue-in-cheek name, "Weasel Fricot" (Fricot a la
  Belette). If you ask Acadians about the origin of the name, they will
  smile and say, "Parce que b'lette a passe tout drouete (Because the
  weasel went right on by.)
  
  On Prince Edward it is called Fricot a la bezette (Ninicompoop Fricot)
  where bezette roughly translates as "nincompoop". It is known as
  butter fricot, salted her fricot and potato fricot, and is often
  served with a large slice of buttered bread and molasses."
  
  Handkerchief Dumplings (Pates en Mouchior de Poche) Mix flour with
  salt. Gradually add cold water to the dough as one would when making
  biscuits. Roll the dough fairly thin, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares and
  place the squares in the fricot. Cover and simmer 7 minutes.
  
  Saute the onion and salted herbs in butter for 1-2 minutes or until
  the onion is golden brown. Add the water, potatoes, salt and pepper,
  and simmer for 20 minutes. To thicken the broth, add dumpling or
  flour mixed with water.

  Gateaux Jos. Louis
  
  Home-made versions of this best selling commercial snacking cake turn
  up in recipe collections throughout the Beauce. A product of the
  giant Vachon bakery at St. Marie, it was launched by founder-bakers
  Arcade and Rose-Anna Vachon who named it for their eldest two sons
  Joseph and Louis and not, as some believe , after the heavyweight
  boxing champion, Joe Louis. Home recipes use a drop-cookie method and
  ~sometimes- a marshmallow filling. The baking cake is made
  automatically with a diameter of 3 1/2 inches (9 cm). To achieve a
  symmetrical look and a light texture, I adapted a recipe belonging to
  Mariette Scully Bourque of Notre Dame des Pins to the muffin tin.
  
  CAKE: Grease 12 medium muffin tins or 24 small ones. In a large bowl,
  cream butter and sugar together until fluffy. Measure milk into a 1
  cup measure and stir in vinegar, then baking soda. In another bowl,
  sift or mix together flour, baking powder, cocoa powder and salt.
  Combine dry ingredients with butter mixture with milk; stir in
  vanilla. Fill prepared muffin tins half full of batter. Bake in a
  preheated 350F oven for about 10 minutes or until a tester inserted
  in centre comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes in pan. Turn out onto
  rack and cool completely.
  
  VANILLA FILLING: In top of a double boiler, set over boiling water,
  combine egg whites, granulated sugar, salt and water. With an
  electric mixer, beat until stiff and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes.
  Remove from heat and beat in vanilla.
  
  CHOCOLATE ICING: Cream soft butter with cocoa powder. Blend in cream
  and vanilla. Stir in sifted icing (confectioner's) sugar until icing
  is of spreading consistency.
  
  Slice cakes in half horizontally. Fill with Vanilla Filling and
  spread tops and sides with Chocolate Icing.

  Tire a la Melasse de Grand-Mere
  
  Quebec's sweet tooth is often satisfied by this old-fashioned candy
  made from molasses and sugar. This recipe belongs to Marguerite
  Legault, a member of Les Fermieres de Thuroso, a rural woman's group
  in the town on the Ottawa River.
  
   In a medium, heavy saucepan, combine molasses, granulated and brown
  sugars and water. Heat to boiling and stir to dissolve sugars. Let
  mixture boil, without stirring, until syrup reaches the hard ball
  stage (260F/125C) on a candy thermometer. Remove from heat, stir in
  butter, baking soda, and salt. Immediately pour onto a buttered
  marble slab or baking sheet.
    When cool enough to handle, butter hands and gather taffy into a
  ball. Pull taffy between hands and continually stretch and fold again
  until taffy turned lighter in colour (this can take from 5 to 15
  minutes.)
    Stretch and twist taffy into a rope about 1 inch thick and cut into
  pieces using buttered scissors. Wrap each piece in waxed paper. MAKES:

 Categories: Meat, Game, Canadian
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Upper jawbone of a moose            1 ts Salt
      1    Onion; sliced                     1/2 ts Pepper
      1    Garlic clove                      1/4 c  Vinegar
      1 tb Mixed pickling spice           
 
  1.  Cut the upper jaw bone of the moose just below the eyes.
  
  2.  Place in a large kettle of scalding water and boil for 45 minutes.
  
  3.  Remove and chill in cold water.
  
  4.  Pull out all the hairs - these will have been loosened by the
  boiling
      and should come out easily ( like plucking a duck).
  
  5.  Wash thoroughly until no hairs remain.
  
  6.  Place the nose in a kettle and cover with fresh water.
  
  7.  Add onion, garlic, spices and vinegar
  
  8.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the meat is
  tender.
      Let cool overnight in the liquid.
  
  9.  When cool, take the meat out of the broth, and remove and discard
  the
      bones and the cartilage.  You will have two kinds of meat, white
  meat
      from the bulb of the nose, and thin strips of dark meat from
  along the
      bones and jowls.
  
  10. Slice the meat thinly and alternate layers of white and dark meat
  in a
      loaf pan.
  
  11. Reheat the broth to boiling, then pour the broth over the meat in
  the
      loaf pan.
  
  12. Let cool until jelly has set.  Slice and serve cold.
  
  I must confess I have not yet tried this recipe, mainly for lack of a
  moose nose...   But, sometime, maybe...

  whole cut-up broiler-fryer chicken. It's from the collection of
  Jeanne d'Arc Nadeau, long-time proprietor of Le Danube Bleu reception
  hall in St. Marie and a cookbook author.
  
    Dredge chicken pieces in flour seasoned with salt and pepper to
  taste. In a heavy, flameproof casserole, heat butter until bubbling
  and brown chicken pieces. Pour maple syrup over chicken. Sprinkle
  with savory, thyme and sage. Arrange onion slices on top of chicken
  pieces. Pour water into the bottom of the casserole. Bake, uncovered
  in 350F oven for 50 to 60 minutes or until tender, basting
  occasionally with pan juices. SERVES: 4

  Tarte au sirop d'erable "This classic sweet of old Quebec has a
  smooth, rich filling, typically shallow and very sweet. Variations of
  the traditional recipes are still popular in Quebec. ... Syrup, sugar
  or molasses pies of all kinds were popular in every region in pioneer
  days. In Quebec Maple Syrup Pie (Tarte au sirop d'erable) and Sugar
  Pie (tarte au sucre) made use of local maple syrup and maple sugar
  when available, or brown sugar for economy.
   Backwoods Pie , using brown sugar plus maple or corn syrup, appears
  in early Nova Scotia cookbooks as well as national books such as the
  Five Roses Cookbook (1915) Molasses Pie (tarte a la ferlouche or
  tarte a la molasses in Quebec) and Lassy Tart (in Newfoundland) was
  usually lightly spiced and thickened with bread crumbs. Shoofly Pie,
  most common in Mennonite areas, had molasses and brown sugar filling
  with crumbs on top. In the early years, when ingredients were scare,
  molasses was a standby everywhere.)
  
  Whisk water with flour until smooth; stir into syrup in small heavy
  saucepan. Stir in egg; cook over medium -low heat, stirring, until

  "This recipe in some old cookbooks is called Date Sandwich Cake. Other
  variations are Raisin Squares or Fig Squares. .. Date Squares
  (Matrimonial Cake, if you happen to come from the West) are a real
  nostalgia treat. The fillings in the 30s recipes was extremely sweet.
  Today's versions reduce the sugar in the filling, since the dates are
  sweet enough, and are often microwaved. Raisin Puff, an old favorite
  in P.E.I. is somewhat similar, with raisin filling sandwiched between
  layers of soft cookie dough instead of an oatmeal mixture."
  
  Filling: In saucepan, cook dates, sugar, lemon juice and water over
  medium heat, stirring often, until the dates are soft, about 15
  minutes. Let cool.
    In a bowl, combine flour, rolled oats, sugar, baking soda and salt;
  blend in butter until mixture is crumbly. Pat half onto bottom of 9
  inch square pan. Spread filling evenly over the top. Sprinkle with
  the remaining flour mixture, patting lightly. Bake in a 350F oven for
  30 to 35 minutes or until nicely browned. Let cool; cut into squares.

  From Blue Ribbon Cook Book, Winnipeg Manitoba 1905 - Mince Pie Hints
  Dried apples soaked in water a few hours make a very fair substitute
  for fresh apples in mince pies.  Dried cherries and other fruit
  prepared with sugar can be soaked 10-12 hours in a very little water
  and then both water and fruit used instead of raisins.  They will be
  much cheaper and will answer very well.  Economical housewives will
  often find hints like these very serviceable.

  spread with mustard and wrapped around dill pickle spears. And in
  many regions of Canada, venison, moose and caribou were used in place
  of beef. In Newfoundland, savory seasons the stuffing and salt pork

  "Recipes for this no-bake treasure appear in countless cookbook as
  Chocolate Fridge Cake, New York Slice, Miracle Bars, Ribbon Squares
  and many other names. But the origin of Nanaimo Bars is still a hot
  topic of debate. The Woman's Auxiliary to the Nanaimo Hospital Cook
  Book (1952) included three similar recipes (two called Chocolate
  Squares and one Chocolate Slice). These recipes appeared under the
  name Nanaimo Bars in the Vancouver Sun in the early 50's and in the
  B.C. Women's Institute Centennial of B.C. Cookbook in 1958. The test
  kitchens of food companies developed various versions with their own
  products. Since the 50s, endless variations include Minted, Grand
  Marnier, Cherry, Pina Colada, Mocha, and Peanut Butter Nanaimo
  Bars...During the 50s, a Dairy Food Service Bureau recipe called
  Dominoes suggested piping a little bit of the middle layer into dots

      3 c  Flour                               1 ts Sugar
      2 tb Baking powder                     1/2 c  Lard

      1 c  Brown sugar                         1 c  -Water
 
  To quote the author Marie Cormier-Boudreau, "These pastries which
  resemble cinnamon rolls, have been made throughout Acadia for many,
  many years. Although they are usually given the colourful name Pet de
  Soeurs (literally nun's fart), they are also be called (sic)
  Rosettes, Rondelles, Hirondells, Bourriques de veilles, Bourriques de
  soeurs or Bourriques de viarges (Rosettes, Slices, Swallows, Old
  Women's Belly Buttons, Nun's Belly Buttons and Virgin's Belly
  Buttons."
  
  Sift the dry ingredients together. Blend in the lard to form a coarse
  mixture. Gradually add the milk until a soft dough is formed. Roll the
  dough until it is fairly thin, although it should be thicker than a
  regular pie crust. Butter the dough with soft butter, cover with 1/4
  inch of brown sugar and sprinkle with cinnamon. Roll the dough up
  like a jelly roll and slice into circles about 1/2 inch thick. Pour
  water into a casserole dish. Put the sliced dough into the casserole
  and bake at 375F for about 30 minutes or until the pets de soeur are
  golden brown.
  
  VARIATION: Cranberry jam may be substituted for the sugar and the
  cinnamon.

  Combine dry ingredients and cut in shortening. Dissolve baking soda
  in the boiling water and add, continuing to mix with a knife. Mold

  Scots first landed in Canada (and where my dad was born.) To quote
  the author, "Our Scottish ancestors used "real" oatmeal when they
  made their favorite oatcakes. However sugar did creep in, as
  indicated by this 75 year old recipe. (The book was published in 1971
  so the recipe would be form the year 1894.)

    1/4 c  Sugar, granulated; approx           2    Eggs
      1 tb Baking powder                     1/3 c  Milk

      2 tb Butter; or shortening          
 
  "Potato scones reflect the influence of the Scottish in the Maritimes
  and their adaptibility in using the famous P.E.I. potato...Scones
  were a favorite Scottish tradition. According to _A Treasury of Nova
  Scotia Recipes_ "the difference between bannock and scone (which the
  Scots rhyme with 'on', not 'bone') is that the bannock is a rather
  large, round cake, and the scone is a smaller triangle or 'farl'..But
  local usages vary considerably, Scots being strong individualists.
   A similar recipe for German Buns appears in an Ontario cookbook from
  the Kitchener area, where German settlers were predominant.
   When Their Majesties King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited
  Government House in Halifax on June 15,1939, scones were served. And
  Canadian Brits gathered for "tea at the Empress" in Victoria for
  scones and tea.
  
  In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt; cut in butter until
  mixture resembles coarse meal. Beat eggs lightly; reserve 1 Tbsp. With
  fork, stir into dry ingredients along with milk  and potatoes until
  well moistened. Knead gently on a lightly floured surface about 20
  times. Roll or pat into circle 1/2 inch thick. Place onto ungreased
  baking sheet; brush with reserved egg yolk and sprinkle with more
  sugar. Cut into 16 wedges, separating slightly. Bake in 425F oven for
  12 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned. MAKES: 16 SCONES
  
  VARIATIONS: RAISIN SCONES: Add 3/4 cup raisins with dry ingredients
  OAT SCONES: Use 1/2 cup rolled oats in place of 1/2 cup flour

  Lemon-flavoured cake batter baked over fresh blueberries makes a
  perfect dessert. When I was immersed in French language studies at

  was a delectable kind of immersion.
  
    Combine blueberries, 1/4 cup of the sugar and lemon rind in a
  buttered 8 inch square baking pan.
    In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. In another bowl,
  cream shortening with remaining 1/2 cup sugar until fluffy. Beat in
  egg and vanilla. Add dry ingredients alternately with milk, blending
  well after each addition and finishing with dry ingredients.
    Pour batter over fruit in pan and bake in a preheated 350F oven for

      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 lb Salt pork, fatty                    4    Potatoes; cooked & mashed
     10    Potatoes; finely grated                  -Salt & Pepper
 
  "For many Acadians living in southeastern New Brunswick, Poultine
  Rapee, potato dumpling dish with a mixture of seasoned pork in the
  centre, is considered a national dish. In other parts of Acadia,
  these delicacies are prepared without the meat and fish is sometimes
  added to fricot. Although the greyish colour and gluey texture of the
  poutines makes them appear somewhat unappetizing, their taste more
  than compensates for their unattractive appearance."
  
  Soak the pork overnight in cold water to remove the salt, and cut into
  cubes. Extract the water from the grated potatoes by putting them in a
  cotton bag and squeezing vigourously. Mix the mashed potatoes with
  grated potatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Roll the potato mixture
  into balls resembling small snowballs. Make a hole in the centre of
  the potato ball and add 1 Tbsp of the salt pork. Close the hole and
  roll the poultines in flour. Gently drop the poultines 2 or 3 at a
  time, into a large pot of boiling salted water, ensuring that the
  water is kept at a rolling boil. Simmer the poultines for 2-3 hours.
  Eat the poultines hot with butter, salt and pepper, or as a dessert
  with sugar and molasses. MAKES: 6 POULTINES

      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Pie dough (double batch)                 Butter
    1/4 c  Cheddar cheese-grated             3/4 c  Sugar
     12    Apples; medium- peeled &          1/4 c  Sugar; Brown
           -cored                            1/4 c  Cream
    1/2 c  Mincement                                Lemon rind; 1/2 lemon
    1/4 c  Rum                            
 
  Preheat oven to 400F. Make enough pie enough to roll into 12 6"x6"
  squares (about a double batch.) Sprinkle each square with 1 tsp
  grated cheddar. Peel and core apples and place one on each square.
  Fill the centre of each apple with 2 tsp (or 1 heaping tsp) of
  mincement, 1 tsp of rum, a dot of butter and 1 Tablespoon sugar.
  Bring diagonally opposite corners of dough over the apple to form
  ears at the top. Cover the 'ears' with aluminium foil. Mix the brown
  sugar, cream and grated lemon rind. Brush the dumplings with this
  mixture and bake 35 to 45 minutes in 400F oven.Remove foil, brush
  ears with cream mixture and return to oven till 'ears' are brown.
  Serve warm to plain cream or sweetened cream, flavoured with rum.
  
  Note from Anne MacLellan: Mme Benoit does not give total amounts for
  cheese, sugar, mincement and rum. I used Meal Master's conversion to
  decimal and back to calculate the total amounts.
  
  To quote Mme. Benoit,"In Quebec these were baked in deep brown
  earthenware pudding dishes and served on a hot wooden board or tray
  surrounded by autumn leaves or boughs cut from the Christmas tree. It
  was a traditional in our family to serve these dumplings after we had
  finished decorating the Christmas tree."

    1/4 c  Parsley                             1 c  Mayonnaise
 
  Spread the oil in a frypan or baking dish. Place the salmon steaks
  next to one another, but not overlapping. Add the lemon juice and
  peel, peppercorns, salt, onion and just enough hot water to cover the
  fish. Cover and poach on top of the stove (if using frypan) over low
  heat, for 10-12 minutes or in 325F oven (in baking dish) for the same
  length of time or until the salmon flakes. Allow the fish to cool in
  the liquid. Drain well and remove the skin. Arrange on platter, then
  cover completely with the following sauce. Serve with a cucumber
  salad.
  
  Sauce Verte: Chop the vegetables coarsely and put in blender with
  lemon juice. Cover and blend until it turns into a sort of mush with
  small bits of this and that in it. Add the mayonnaise and blend. If
  you don't have a blender, chop the ingredients very finely and blend
  them into the mayonnaise with the lemon juice, crushing them as much
  as possible to give color to the sauce.
  
  From the author, "Use salmon steaks for this colourful and tasty
  dish. It is then easy to make it for 2 or 10."

  "This date and nut cake always included a broiled topping. Lazy Daisy

  have appeared in cook books coast to coast for many years. Some claim
  that the recipe was a favorite of the Queen Mother and given to
  worthy groups as a fund raiser during World War II. One from Quebec's
  Eastern Townships includes the footnote that says that, "This is not
  to be passed on but must be sold for charitable purposes for 15 cents.
    In a reply to our query about the name of this recipe, the Queen
  Mother's Lady-in-Waiting writes; "I fear I have to tell you that,
  although we have known about this recipe for many years, it did not
  originate from either Buckingham Palace or Clarence House...However
  as Her Majesty always made it a rule, due to the number of requests
  received, never to give "favorite recipes", I fear that I have to
  tell you that you that should you wish to include this recipe in any
  cookbook, it should only be called a 'date and walnut cake' with no
  reference to the Queen Mother."
  
  Pour water over dates and soda; let stand until lukewarm. In bowl,
  cream butter with sugar; beat in egg and vanilla. Mix together flour,
  baking powder and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with date

  in 350F oven for 40 minutes or until tester comes out clean.
  
  Broiled Topping: In a small heavy saucepan, combine butter, packed
  brown sugar, light cream and coconut (half nuts if desired). Bring to
  a boil, stirring; boil gently for 1 minute. Spread over warm baked
  cake; broil until bubbly and lightly browned, watching carefully.

      1 c  Chopped fresh chervil             1/4    To 1/2 cup coarse salt
 
  These seasonings seem to be added to a lot of traditional French-
  Canadian recipes. "Herbs preserved with vegetables and salt make a
  lively seasoning for soups-particularly pea soup - sauces, stews and
  omelettes.  A commercial brand, Les Herbes Salees du bas du fleuve,
  is marketed by J.Y. Roy of St. Flavie, Quebec.  This recipe comes
  from the Metis district."
  
  In a large bowl, combine herbs and vegetables.  Layer 1 inch of herb
  mixture in the bottom of a crock or glass bowl and sprinkle with some
  of the salt.  Repeat layers until all of the herb mixture and salt is
  used. Cover and refrigerate for 2 weeks. Drain off accumulated liquid
  and pack herb mixture into sterilized jars.  Refrigerate until ready
  to use.  Makes about 5 to 6 cups.

  "A traditional Atlantic chowder is made with fish or shellfish, canned
  milk, potatoes, onions and is served with a dollop of butter. This
  version, which comes from a Nova Scotia fisherman and uses sour
  cream, fresh cream and thyme, is quite different and very good. When
  reheated leftover chowder, it may be necessary to add a little more
  milk or cream, because the fish and potatoes will have absorbed some
  of the liquid."
  
  Cook the onion in the butter until transparent. Add the thyme and
  celery salt. Remove from heat. In a saucepan, pour the whipping cream
  over the fish fillets.Cover, bring to a boil and simmer slowly for 10
  minutes or till the fish flakes easily. Remove the fish with a
  slotted spoon, then break into small pieces and remove any bones. Add
  the onion mixture and the scallops to the poaching liquid. Bring to
  barely a boil, then simmer for about 1 minute or till the scallops
  are opaque. If the chowder is not to be eaten immediately,
  refrigerate everything at this stage. Just before serving, add the
  fish, lobster, sour cream, potatoes and milk. Heat through, but do
  not allow to boil. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle into soup
  bowls. Sprinkle with paprika. Serve immediately. SERVES: 4-6 from the

  "The Home Cook Book , published in Toronto in 1879, included a recipe
  for Toronto pie. Although continuing as a family favorite, the name
  slipped into disuse during the intervening years. A delicate,
  hot-milk sponge cake split and filled with raspberry jam, Toronto Pie
  belongs in the same family as Boston cream pie." During my 30+ years
  living in Toronto, I have never heard of this cake.
  
  Grease a 9 inch round layer cake pan and line with wax paper. Combine
  scalded milk and butter.
  
  Sift or blend together flour, baking powder and salt. Beat 2 eggs
  until very light and fluffy. Gradually beat in granulated sugar and
  vanilla.
  
  With mixer at high speed beat eggs and sugar for 1 minute. Fold in dry
  ingredients and then stir in hot milk mixture. Turn into prepared
  pan. Bake in preheated 350F oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until cake
  springs back when lightly touched.
  
  Cool in pan. When almost cool, loosen edges and remove from pan.
  Split into two layers, sandwich together with raspberry jam and
  sprinkle icing sugar on top.

  through cooking time, season with salt to taste.  Stir in rolled oats
  and cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove bay leaf.
  
  Meanwhile, line a 9-inch pie plate with pastry.  When meat mixture is
  lukewarm, spoon into pie shell and cover with remaining pastry. Trim
  pastry, seal edges and cut steam vents in top crust.  Decorate with
  pastry cutouts as desired.  Bake in preheated 425 deg F oven for 15

 Categories: Meat, Canadian
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3 tb Bacon fat or salad oil            1/4 ts Pepper
      2    Garlic cloves, cut in half        1/4 ts Thyme OR:
      1    Veal - 1/2 leg or:                1/2 ts Savory
           -3 or 4 lb rolled shoulder          1    Bay leaf
           -of veal                            6    Potatoes - medium (6-8)
      1 ts Salt                                6    Onions - medium (6-8)
 
  Melt or heat bacon fat or oil in cast iron saucepan. Stuff the 2
  cloves of garlic, cut in two, into incisions made in the veal. Place
  the meat in the hot fat and brown well on all sides. Don't rush this
  as the colour and flavour of the finished gravy will depend on how
  well the meat has been browned. Add the thyme or savory and the bay
  leaf. Place the potatoes and onions, whole around the meat. Don't add
  any liquid. Cover tightly and cook over medium heat till meat is
  tender, about 2 hours. The potatoes and onions will not break as
  there is no liquid added. The veal will make its own gravy. When
  cooked, remove the meat from the pan to a heated platter. Place the
  pan over high heat and stir gently, so as not to break up the
  vegetables. When they are well coated with gravy, boil another
  minutes or so till the gravy has a nice consistency. This is a
  complete meal.

      1 ds Cinnamon (or to taste)         
 
  Saute bacon and some onion in oil.  Then add beef, sausage, green
  pepper and the rest of the onion.  Cook until meat is browned.  Then
  add mushrooms, tomatoes (with juice), bay leaf and seasonings.
  Simmer for 1 hour.  Add tomato paste and wine and simmer for another
  30 minutes. If your sauce winds up being a little runny, add some
  more tomato paste or let simmer uncovered till desired consistency is
  achieved. I rarely make this recipe the same way twice.  It's a very
  forgiving recipe and experimentation is reccommended.  Try adding a
  dash of Worchestershire sauce and/or a dash of bitters.  Add some
  oregano, whatever you like. This recipe also doubles very easily. The
  amount of garlic was purposely vague as I'm one of those people who
  feel that you can never have enough garlic. If you're not a
  garlic-aholic, you probably will only need one clove of garlic. This
  was given to me by my father Jerry Elliott. ~- Hunter Elliott

      Title: Amaretti
 Categories: Cake/cookie, Italian
      Yield: 42 servings
 
    1/2 lb Canned almond paste                      Granulated sugar
      1 c  Sugar                                    - for dusting
      2 lg Egg whites                     
 
  PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 375F. Break the almond paste into small pieces and
  combine it with the sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer. Mix on low
  speed until very fine. Add egg whites in 4 additions, mixing about 1
  minute between each. Beat the paste until very smooth, about 2-to-3
  minutes. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tube with the
  mixture. Line 2 cookie sheets or jelly roll pans with parchment
  paper. Pipe the mixture on the paper in 1-to-1 1/2-inch mounds, about
  1-inch apart. Fold a clean kitchen towel into a long strip and
  moisten the towel with water. Squeeze lightly to eliminate excess
  water, leaving the towel more than damp. Slap the surface of the
  Amaretti gently with the towel to moisten them and make the surface
  smooth. Sprinkle the Amaretti with granulated sugar. Bake about
  15-to-20 minutes, until they are well risen, a deep golden color, and
  their surface is covered with tiny cracks. Remove from the oven and
  place the pans on racks to cool. To remove the Amaretti from the
  papers, turn the papers over with the Amaretti still adhering to them
  and wet the papers with hot water, using a brush. Leave a few
  minutes, then pull on the papers to release the Amaretti. HERE ARE 2
  VARIATIONS OF AMARETTI: Amaretti di Pinoli: After moistening the
  piped Amaretti, strew them with pine nuts, sprinkling them on
  heavily, then pressing lightly with the fingertips so that the pine
  nuts adhere. Do not dust with sugar. Bake as for the Amaretti. Fior
  di Mandorla: This variation of Amaretti is popular in Southern Italy
  and Sicily, where the mixture is sometimes colored green or pink
  during the mixing. Their rough, craggy appearance is a nice contrast
  to the smoothness of the standard Amaretti. Prepare the Amaretti, up
  to, and including, moistening them with the towel. Dust heavily with
  confectioners' sugar and allow the piped mixture to dry at room
  temperature, uncovered, at least 12 hours, or overnight. After they
  have dried, indent each of the piped mounds with the thumb, first and
  middle fingers of one hand, positioning them equidistant around the
  circumference, and pinching gently inward, about half way into the
  center. Bake the Fior di Mandorla at 375F, about 15-to-20 minutes.
  Cool and loosen the Fior di Mandorla as for the Amaretti. NICK

  water for about 1 minute, then in cool water and the peel will come
  off immediately. according to the author, "It's hard to believe, -for
  example, that eggplant and fiocchio (fennel), the quintessence of
  Italian cooking, were originally only used by Jews." She quotes
  Pellegrino Artusi in the cookbook _Scienza e L'Arte di Mangiar Bene_
  published in 1910 that forty year earlier (1870s) that eggplants and
  fennel rarely appeared in Florentine markets as they were considered
  to be Jewish food only. Peel and dice eggplant. Season with salt &
  pepper and set aside in colander to drain off liquid. Heat the oil in
  a large skillet; add celery, onion, peppers, garlic and carrot and
  cook, uncovered, over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, 10
  to 12 minutes. Transfer vegetables to shallow baking dish, but retain
  the oil. Add eggplant to oil in skillet and sprinkle with flour. Fry,
  stirring, over moderate heat, until lightly golden. Add to baking
  dish with vegetables. Add tomatoes, green olives, vinegar, sugar,
  basil and parlsey and place in 350F oven for 1/2 hour. Remove from

 Categories: Jewish, Italian, Appetizer, Rice
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 c  Rice; short grained                 1 lb Mozzarella; cut in 24 1/4
    1/4 c  Onion; finely minced                1 c  Bread crumbs; fine
      2 tb Olive oil                           1 c  Vegetable oil; for frying
      1 ts -salt                               2    Eggs; slightly beaten
  3 1/2 c  -hot water                               -inch X 1 inch bits
      1 c  Tomatoes; peeled               
 
  Suppli al Telefono To quote the author, "It is not easy to make
  Suppli al Telefono. Nevertheless, it pays to make the effort once in
  awhile because this dish always makes family and guests happy. The
  name comes from the fact that a thread of cheese will spin between
  your mouth and the suppli while you are eating it, resembling the
  mouthpiece of an early model telephone from the time this dish was
  first created. Suppl can be served as an appetizer, as a side dish in
  a dairy meal, or as a meal in itself for a lunch or brunch. ...Suppli
  should be served piping hot. Tell your guests, who might have never
  had them before, that suppli should be eaten with the fingers." Place
  rice, onion and olive oil in 2 qt saucepan and saute 2 or 3 minutes,
  stirring frequently. Add salt and 3 1/2 cups hot water. Bring to a
  boil. Lower heat to minimum and cook, covered, without stirring, 15
  minutes. Add tomatoes and cook, uncovered, 5 minutes longer, stirring
  frequently. The rice should now be quite dry. Remove from heat and
  cool for 15 to 20 minutes, add eggs and mix well. With damp hands,
  shape heaping tablespoons of the mixture into croquettes the size of
  a large egg; insert one piece of cheese into each croquette,

      Title: Plainest Italian Sausage
 Categories: Meat, Italian
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8    Foot of sausage casing,           1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
           - packed in salt                    2 ts Fennel seeds
  1 1/2 lb Boneless pork                            - lightly crushed
    1/2 lb Fresh pork fat                      2 tb Dry red wine
      1 tb Salt                           
 
  SCRAPE THE LOOSE SALT OFF the sausage casing and set the casing in a
  bowl of cold water to soften for at least 30 minutes. (You will need
  only about 4 feet of casing for this amount of meat, but it's useful
  to have extra in case of ruptures.) Cut the pork and fat into pieces
  that will go through your meat grinder and grind them, using the
  coarse blade. Mix the salt, pepper and fennel seeds thoroughly into
  the ground meat. (Hands are the best implement.) Then mix in the
  wine. Drain the casing, open one end gently with your fingers and run
  a stream of cold water into it, to flush any remaining salt out of
  the interior. Thread the casing onto the stuffing horn and fit the
  horn over the meat grinder. Feed the sausage meat through the horn,
  supporting the emerging tube of sausage with your hands to prevent
  rips. (Actually, sausage making is much more conveniently done with
  two people.) When all the sausage meat is in the casing, lay the
  filled tube on the work surface and pinch it at 4-inch intervals to
  produce individual sausage links. At the same time, fill and firm any
  air pockets in the casing. Tie off the links with kitchen string.
  Coil the sausages onto a plate and set it, uncovered, in the
  refrigerator to season for 48 hours. Turn the sausages over once or
  twice during that time.

           Basil, fresh; shredded         
 
  An ancient Roman Jewish dish No quantities are given "as they are not
  important; Concia can be prepared to be more less piquant, according
  to taste, by increasing or decreasing the quantity of herbs and
  spices. It freezes beautifully in a tightly closed container, but it
  must be used within a few days if stored in the refrigerator or after
  thawing, being a rather perishable food. Eggplant was also prepared
  as Concia in Rome, but its texture is less desirable than eggplant.
  
  Trim off the ends of the zucchini; then cut each one in half; slice
  each half thinly lengthwise and place slices on paper towel to dry
  for several hours or overnight. Fry in hot olive oil in a single
  layer until golden brown on both sides. Arrange in layers in glass,
  plastic or porcelain container and season each layer with small
  amounts of garlic, basil, salt and pepper, and a sprinkle of vinegar.
  Cover the container and store in the refrigerator at least several
  hours before using. The flavour will be enhanced if you turn the
  Concia as a block inside the container a few times while it is
  marinating to allow the juices to seep through.

  They welcomed us. One of the their children was celebrating First
  Communion and they were delighted to share the happy event with us.
  In fact,as if we were part of the family, we helped in the
  preparations. They had very little sugar, which they had saved from
  before the war and asked us to make one of our desserts with it. It
  was near Shavout and we thought of Tortelli Dolci. Some of the
  ingredients were missing, but they were delicious to anyway or so it
  seemed to us at the time."

           -cold water                              Artichokes
      2    Lemons                         
 
  Source: _The Classic Cuisine of th0e Italian Jews_ by Edda Servi

  " The ancient Roman Jews devised a brilliant technique for cleaning
  artichokes for their renown Carciofi alla Giuida. The curious thing
  is that when I lived in Italy no one, including Jews from other parts
  of the country knew how to clean artichokes the way the Roman Jews
  did...
    Have a large bowl at hand, containing cold water and the juice of
  two lemon with the four halves of the rind. Keep the artichokes in
  another bowl of cold water while you are working on them. Take one
  artichoke at a time, drain it, and pull off and discard the smallest
  outer leaves. Holding the artichoke with its bottom toward the little
  finger of your hand, tilt the top away from you, and holding a small
  sharp knife tightly with your right hand, insert its tip, one leaf
  deep, into the tender, lighter part of the leaves. Keeping your right
  hand steady, slowly rotate the artichoke with your left hand so the
  bottom moves in a clockwise direction, and cut upward in a spiral.
  The tough part of each leaf will fall off, while the tender edible
  part remains attached. Peel the green layer off the bottom and stem,
  and then drop the trimmed artichoke into the lemon juice until you
  are ready to cook. This operation requires some practice; you will
  know if you have mastered this technique when the artichoke thus
  cleaned looks more or less like the one you started with, only
  smaller and whiter.
    If you are not ready to use the artichokes immediately after you
  have cleaned them, try to keep them completely submerged in lemon
  water. This is not easy. Artichokes are very buoyant and float to the
  surface making it difficult to keep them covered. An inverted plate,
  just a bit smaller in diameter than the bowl, place over the
  artichokes, will keep them below the surface. Another way is to crowd
  them inside a glass jar and cover them with the lemon water. If you
  plan to leave them at this stage for more than a hour or so, you must
  refrigerate them, but it is not advisable to keep artichokes this way
  for more than a few hours. Lemon is used to prevent discoloration; on
  the other hand, the lemon will cause the artichokes to spoil very
  quickly."

      2    Lemons; juice and rinds             3 c  Olive oil
      2 tb -salt                          
 
  Carciofo All Guidia To quote the author, "This is the most famous of
  all Italian Jewish foods. It originated with the Roman Jews, and owes
  its fame to having been served at a restaurant in the Roman ghetto
  where it was discovered and quickly adopted by connoisseurs of
  excellent food all over Europe. Utimately it found its way into many
  Italian cookbooks, My mother, a Jewish woman who was born and raised
  in Rome, prepared especially delicious Carciofi all Guidia (better
  than you could find in any restaurant!). I watched her prepare them,
  and have prepared them myself, practically all my life. Here in my
  mother's technique in detail"
  
  Trim the artichokes as detailed in "How to clean artichokes- Jewish
  style" and keep them in lemon water till you are ready to use them.
  "Drain the two artichokes and, holding one in each hand by the stem
  and bottom, gently hit the leafy parts against each other until the
  leaves of one open up a little. Place the opened artichoke, bottom
  up, on a board or a working surface. Drain another artichoke from its
  bath and repeat what you did with the first two, and line up the one
  that opens next to the last one. Continue until all the artichokes
  are opened up. The last one will have to be tapped against the board.
  In a small bowl, combine salt and pepper. Take one artichoke at a
  time and sprinkle all over, including between the leaves, with salt
  and pepper mixture. Heat the oil in a deep earthenware or similar
  saucepan. Cook as many artichokes at a time as fit in one layer over
  moderate heat for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the bottoms and the
  sides are well browned. During the cooking period, sprinkle some cold
  water over the artichokes to produce steam, so that the inside will
  be cooked, too. To do this the authentic way, have a bowl containing
  cold water near the range. Dip your closed fist in the water and then
  open it forcefully over the roasting artichokes. Repeat sprinkling
  several times. When all the artichokes are done, transfer them to a
  plate, bottom side down to keep the moisture in.* Pick them up at the
  bottom with a fork and dip them, one by one in the hot oil again,
  pressing the leaves to the bottom of the pan. The artichokes will
  open up like roses and the leaves will become golden and crisp. Serve
  immediately.

  Carciofi Dorati E Fritti To quote the author, "The reason why these
  fried artichokes are called dorati (golden) is that they are dipped
  in beaten eggs before frying...eggs from chickens raised on farms
  have yolks of a much richer color than the eggs on finds in the
  market today, and food dipped in eggs acquire a golden color...The
  best artichokes for this dish are the very best fresh and tender ones
  which have no choke at all and require only a very short cooking
  time." Prepare artichokes as directed in "How to clean artichokes -
  Jewish styles"."Cut in half lengthwise and cut each half into 3
  wedges,; keep them in this acidulated water (lemon water) for no
  longer than 15 minutes. Drain and pat dry with paper towels. Dredge
  with flour and shake to remove excess. Beat the eggs yolks together.
  Heat the oil in a small frying pan. Dip artichokes in beaten egg and
  fry, a few at a time, in moderately hot oil till lightly browned on
  all sides. Sprinkle with salt, garnish with lemon wedges, and serve
  immediately.

  Risotto Coi Carciofi To quote the author," In Pitigliano it was
  traditionally served during Passover*, when artichokes are in season
  and tender". *"Other differences (between Italian Jews and Ashkenazic
  Jews) stem from the fact that some foods are not considered kosher by
  the Ashkenazim are permitted by the Italkim or Sephardim and vice
  versa. For example, rice, which was a staple for us at Passover, is
  considered chamtaz, or leavened food, by the Ashkenazim, whereas
  chocolate, cheese, and other milk products, so widely used by the
  American Jews during Passover, were absolutely forbidden for us,
  because we considered them to be chametz."
  
  Trim artichokes; remove any choke and slice very thin. Heat oil
  thoroughly in a large skillet and add the artichoke slices. Season
  with 2 teaspoons salt and pepper to taste. Cook over high heat,
  stirring frequently , for approximately 5 minutes. Lower heat to
  medium and cook, stirring frequently, another 10 minutes. Bring 3
  cups of water with 1 tsp salt to a boil. Add rice and cook, covered,
  for 12 to 15 minutes. Add to skillet with artichokes and stir to
  combine. SERVES: 6

      Title: Pasta - Basic Recipe for Homemade
 Categories: Jewish, Italian, Pasta
      Yield: 1 servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Flour;unbleached; up to             4    Eggs;slightly beaten
           -3 cups                        
 
  Ricetta Base Per Pasta in Casa (Basic Recipe for Homemade Pasta)
  
  HAND ROLLED: Mound part of the flour in a large board or other working
  surface and make a well at center. Pour in eggs. With the aid of a
  fork, mix eggs and flour very gradually until a soft paste forms.
  With your finger mix in enough flour to make a firm but not too hard,
  dough. Knead for about 5 minutes, till dough is smooth. Place in an
  unfloured dish; cover with an inverted dish and let it rest in the
  refrigerator for about 1/2 hour.
    Take half of the dough, knead it lightly, and shape into a ball.
  Place on a well floured board. With the palms of your hands, flatten
  the ball, keeping the round shape, and sprinkle with flour. With the
  rolling pin, begin to thin the disk out in all directions, trying not
  to lose the round shape. Continue to sprinkle with flour as it
  becomes necessary, so that the dough does not stick to the pin. As
  soon as the disk of dough is thin enough to be rolled AROUND the
  rolling pin do so.* Starting from the end farthest from you, begin to
  roll the dough toward you, using small, even strokes back and forth,
  at the same time you swiftly slide your hands inward to the centre
  and outward to the edges of the pin. When the sheet is all rolled
  around the pin, PUSH the pin away from you at arm's length; then
  vigorously ROLL it back towards you, so that one  side of the sheet
  flaps several times over the board. Turn the pin 90 degrees and
  unroll the sheet from it. Repeat from * as many times as needed for
  the desired thinness. Repeat with the other half of the dough and use
  as directed in each individual recipe. SERVES: 6 to 16, depending on
  the different uses made of it
  
  WITH A HAND OPERATED MACHINE: Make a dough, using the method described
  above or by mixing eggs and flour in bowl. Knead over a well-floured
  board, mixing until they have a very firm dough. There is no need to
  make it smooth because the machine will take care of that. Place in
  an unfloured dish; cover with an inverted dish and let it rest in the
  refrigerator for about 1/2 hour.
   Take 1/4th of the dough at a time and begin the thinning. With the
  rollers set at the first slot (farthest apart), feed the dough
  between the rollers while turning the crank. If some of the dough
  sticks to the rollers or to the machine, that means the dough is too
  soft and more flour must be added. Fold and feed with the rollers set
  at the same slot 3 or 4 times, until the sheet comes out in one piece
  (but not too smooth). Move on to the second slot and feed the sheet
  only once. Keeping on moving till the desired thinness is achieved.
  For lasagna or fettucini you stop at the next to last slot. For
  taglierini or calzonicchi, go through the last slot once, wait a few
  seconds, then feed the sheet into the last slot again. (Pasta made
  with only eggs and flour tends to be very elastic and it tends to
  shrink. However, the second time through it keeps the shape better.)
    Repeat with the remaining pasta, using 1/4th of the original
  quantity each time. Use as directed in the individual recipe.
  
  *for electric pasta makers, follow the manufacturer's directions, but
  most machines will not provide sheet pasta for lasagna, ravoli, etc.

  * Olio di Arrosto literally means "oil from a roast"."But  "oil from a
  roast" can be misleading, since one might associate it with the fatty
  drippings from an oven roast. Nothing could be further from the
  truth. "Oil from a roast" is the oil that is used to pan roast very
  lean meats such as veal, lamb loaf etc. These pan roasted meats must
  be so lean that when they go into the pan that when they are cooked
  the remaining oil is as clear as when you started....Sometimes,
  however, you may find that a recipe you want to make lists olio di
  arrosto, but you don't have any on hand. In that case, rather than
  giving up trying your recipe until you make a a pan roast, prepare
  the following substitute."
  
  Olio di Arrosto: Heat the oil with all the other ingredients and cook,
  stirring, for 4 to 5 minutes or until garlic is quite brown. Add a few
  drops of water or white to produce the steam which will bind the
  flavours to the oil. Remove from heat and let cool. Discard the
  garlic and fresh herbs by simply lifting them with a fork. If you
  used dried herbs, strain the oil, but be sure that the salt and
  pepper are not removed. Note: You may add a shank bone or any other
  bone for a more authentic flavor. YIELDS: 1/2 CUP

  Green Lasagna To quote the author, "Many years ago, I invited some
  friends to try mu kosher green lasagne. At first they declined my
  invitation (being strictly orthodox, they seldom accepted invitations
  to eat in other people's homes). But when I insisted that I would buy
  everything new -from pots and pans to tablecloth and dishes - they
  accepted. They came early, so I prepared everything with their help.
  We had a lot of fun, and they liked my lasagna so much that they
  asked to stay for supper to eat the leftovers. Of course, I was very
  flattered and delighted that they stayed."
  
  Squeeze most of the liquid of the spinach. Chop very fine to the
  consistency of a smooth paste.  Make dough with spinach, eggs and
  flour as needed, following the directions for pasta - homemade. Roll
  it thin, sprinkling often with flour to avoid sticking . Cut into
  strips about 5X8 inches. Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil with 3
  Tbsp salt. Cook a few strips at a time for 2 minutes, uncovered.
  Remove from boiling water with a slotted spoon and drop into a basin
  of cold water. Drain and spread over a slightly damp cloth. Coat the
  bottom of a lasagna baking dish with 2 Tbsp oil and 1/4 cup tomato
  sauce. Place in it one layer; lightly cover it with tomato sauce and
  dollops of cheese sauce. Sprinkle with some Parmesan cheese and
  continue to make layers until you have used up all the pasta and the
  sauces. Sprinkle top with remaining oil and bake in a 400F oven for
  approximately 20 minutes. Serve with remaining Parmesan cheese in a
  separate dish. SERVES: 6

      Yield: 48 servings
 
      3    Eggs                            1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      2 ts Anise extract                     1/4 c  Cornstarch
    3/4 c  Sugar                             1/2 ts Baking powder
      1 pn Salt                           
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Combine the eggs, extract, sugar and salt in a
  mixing bowl or the bowl of an electric mixer and whip with a hand
  mixer set at high speed or in a heavy duty mixer fitted with the
  whip. Continue whipping until the mixture is very light and increased
  in volume, 6-7 minutes. While the egg mixture is whipping, combine
  the flour, cornstarch and baking powder and stir to mix. Remove the
  whipped eggs from the mixer and sift over the flour mixture in three
  additions, folding it in after each addition with a rubber spatula.
  The batter will lose most of its air and become rather stiff. Pipe
  the batter, using a pastry bag with a 3/4-inch opening, but no tube,
  onto a jelly roll pan lined with parchment paper or buttered wax
  paper. Pipe two logs about 1 1/2 inches wide and the length of the
  pan. Bake the logs about 20 minutes, until they are well risen and
  golden. Remove from  oven and place logs on a cutting board to cool
  about 10 minutes. Using a sharp, serrated knife, slice the logs
  diagonally at 1/2-inch intervals. Place the biscotti cut side down on
  the pan and return them to the oven for about 10-15 minutes, until
  they color lightly on the cut surfaces. Cool the biscotti on the pans
  and store them in a tin between layers of wax paper.

  Be careful with the first baking of these biscotti. Even though they
  are baked a second time after being cut, if they do not bake
  sufficiently the first time, the biscotti will have a hard, heavy
  core.
  
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Combine all ingredients except honey and water
  in a mixing bowl and stir a minute or 2 to mix. Add the honey and
  water and stir until a firm dough forms. Remove dough from bowl and
  divide in half. Roll each half into a log about 15 inches long. Place
  both logs, well apart, on a jelly roll pan lined with parchment or
  buttered wax paper. Bake about 30 minutes, until well risen, firm and
  a dark golden color. Remove from oven, cool logs slightly and place
  on a cutting board. Slice the logs diagonally at 1/2-inch intervals.
  Return the cut biscotti to the pan, cut side down, and bake an
  additional 15 minutes, until lightly colored and dry. Cool on the
  pan. Store in a tin--they keep well.

      Yield: 10 servings
 
MMMMM-----------------PASTA FROLLA ALLE MANDORLE----------------------

MMMMM-------------------SWEET DOUGH W/ALMONDS------------------------
  1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour                   1 pn Salt
    1/2 c  Ground blanched almonds             5 tb Cold unsalted butter
    1/4 c  Sugar                               1    Egg

MMMMM--------------------FOR THE STRAWBERRIES-------------------------
      3 pt Ripe strawberries                 1/2 c  Strawberry jam
      2 tb Sugar                                    Confectioners' sugar
      1 ts Lemon juice                              - for finishing
 
  Use a sharp knife to cut the crostata to keep the berries from
  toppling and lessening the elegant symmetry of the dessert.
  
  FOR THE PASTA FROLLA: Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl and mix
  well. Rub in the butter until it is absorbed. Make sure the mixture
  remains cool and powdery and does not become pasty. Beat the egg and
  stir in with a fork. Continue stirring until the dough holds
  together, then knead it smooth, briefly. Shape into a disk, wrap in
  plastic and refrigerate at least 1 hour, or until firm.
  
  FOR THE STRAWBERRIES: Rinse and hull berries. Choose the best ones to
  border the tart (draw a 9-inch circle on wax paper and arrange berries
  inside to see how many you need). Slice remaining berries into a
  bowl; add sugar and lemon juice. Toss to combine and cover with
  plastic wrap. Refrigerate the sliced and whole berries until ready to
  assemble the crostata. Preheat oven to 350F and set a rack in the
  middle level. To form tart base, roll three-quarters of the dough on
  a floured surface to a 9-inch disk. Transfer to a cookie sheet lined
  with parchment or buttered wax paper. Place a 9-inch disk, like a
  spring- form bottom, on dough and trim to a 9-inch diameter. Pierce
  the dough all over with a fork at 1/2-inch intervals. Combine the
  scraps with the remaining dough and roll it into a thin cylinder,
  about 30-inches long. Moisten the edge of the base with water and
  arrange the cylinder of dough on it, to form sides on the tart shell.
  Press the cylinder with fingertip to make it adhere and mark a series
  of diagonal lines on it with the back of a small knife. Bake about 25
  minutes, until the dough is an even golden color and feels firm when
  pressed with fingertip. Cool the tart shell on a rack on the pan.
  Place cooled shell on a platter. Spread bottom evenly with jam.
  Arrange a row of the whole strawberries inside the edge. Drain sliced
  berries well; pile in center. Dust with sugar.

      Title: Herbed Focaccia
 Categories: Bread, Italian
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 pk Dry yeast                           1 ts Dried rosemary
      1 ts Sugar                               1 ts Dried basil
      1 c  Warm water (105-115F)               1 ts Dried oregano
  2 1/3 c  Bread flour                              Kosher salt
    1/3 c  Cornmeal                            1 tb Fresh chives, snipped
  1 1/4 ts Salt                                1 tb Fresh parsley, minced
    1/2 c  Light-tasting olive oil             1 tb Red pepper flakes
      2 lg Garlic cloves; minced          
 
  A small amount of cornmeal gives this focaccia--a flat bread--a
  perfect texture for improvised open sandwiches. You might start with
  thinly sliced salami and cheese.
  
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 450F. Fifteen minutes before baking focaccia, put
  rack in center of oven. If you have 2 ovens, preheat both; otherwise
  bake focaccias in sequence, one after the other. Generously oil 2
  large baking sheets, preferably black steel. Stir yeast and sugar
  into warm water. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Mix flour,
  cornmeal and salt in food processor fitted with metal blade (can also
  be kneaded with mixer dough hook or by hand). Turn on processor.
  Slowly pour yeast mixture through feed tube. Also pour 2 tablespoons
  oil through. Process until dough cleans inside of work bowl but is
  still moist. If it sticks, add a little flour; if it's dry, add a
  little water. Once dough is moist but not so wet that it sticks to
  sides of bowl, process until uniformly kneaded, elastic and supple,
  about 40 seconds. Transfer dough to large plastic food bag, squeeze
  out air and seal at top, allowing room for dough to expand. Let dough
  rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; use
  immediately or refrigerate overnight. Combine remaining 6 tablespoons
  oil, garlic and dried herbs. Gently heat until warm (not hot) on
  stove top or microwave oven. Divide dough in half. Let rest 5
  minutes. On floured board, roll each piece into about a 12-inch
  round. Transfer to prepared baking sheets. Prick surface with fork.
  Brush with oil mixture, including edges. Sprinkle with Kosher salt.
  Bake, one at a time, until very lightly browned around edges only,
  about 8-10 minutes. Do not overbake. Check after 2 minutes in oven;
  prick any air pockets with fork. Brush with any remaining oil,
  including edges. Sprinkle with fresh herbs and pepper flakes. Can be
  baked in advance and frozen. To do so, cool completely, freeze and
  then wrap airtight. Let thaw in wrapping. To reheat, place in cold
  oven and set at 300F. Bake until hot, about 5-7 minutes. Cut into
  wedges and serve hot. Yield: 2 12-inch rounds.

      Title: Krumiri
 Categories: Cake/cookie, Italian
      Yield: 48 servings
 
      1 c  Unsalted butter                     1 ts Vanilla extract
    2/3 c  Sugar                           1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      3    Egg yolks                           1 c  Yellow cornmeal
 
  PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 325F. Beat the butter with the sugar by hand,
  with a hand mixer set at medium speed, or in a heavy-duty mixer
  fitted with the paddle. Continue beating until the mixture lightens
  both in texture and color, about 4 or 5 minutes. Beat in the vanilla,
  then the yolks, one at a time, beating smooth after each addition.
  Stir the flour and cornmeal together, and stir into the butter
  mixture by hand. Line 2 or 3 cookie sheets with parchment paper and
  pipe the Krumiri in horseshoe or stick shapes, using a pastry bag
  fitted with a 1/2-inch star tube (Ateco #4). Bake about 15 minutes.
  Remove from pans and cool on a rack.
  
  VARIATION OF KRUMIRI: SCHIACCATINE DI GRANTURCO. These wonderful
  biscotti are always on the bar at Tonino and Claudia Verro's charming
  inn, Contea, at Neive, near Alba in Piemonte. The surrounding area,
  known as the Langhe for its situation in the Langa hills, has some of
  Italy's most breathtaking natural scenary, as well as excellent wine
  and Grappa.
  
  FOLLOW THE RECIPE FOR KRUMIRI, but do not pipe the dough. Divide the
  dough in half and place each half on a piece of parchment or wax
  paper. Shape the dough into a rough log about 1-inch diameter and
  about 6 inches long. Roll and tighten the paper around the dough, to
  make it perfectly cylindrical. Chill the cylinders of dough about 1
  hour, until firm. Remove one piece at a time from the refrigerator
  and slice the cylinder into disks 1/4-inch thick. Arrange the disks
  of dough on paper-lined cookie sheets, 1 inch apart on all sides.
  Continue with the other cylinder of dough. Bake as for the Krumiri.

  In a large pot, place the meat, water, salt, small onion, celery
  leaves and bay leaf.  Cover and simmer for about 2-1/2 hours until
  the meat is tender. Remove the meat.  Strain the broth (should
  measure 2 quarts). Add ice cubes to the broth to harden the fat and
  remove the fat.  Discard the fat. Finely dice the meat, discarding
  any fat and bones (should be about 2 cups). In a 5 to 6 quart kettle
  or Dutch oven, combine the beef broth and the meat. Place over low
  heat while preparing the remaining ingredients. Pan fry the bacon
  until crisp.  Add the bacon and the drippings and all the remaining
  ingredients, except the Parmesan cheese, to the broth. Cover and
  simmerfor about 30 minutes, until the vegetables and macaroni are
  tender. Serve sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, if desired. From:

           -(14 1/2 oz. size cans)             1 tb Sugar

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Ricotta cheese                           Grated Parmesan
    3/4 lb Spinach; cooked and chopped              -=OR=- Sharp pecorino cheese

      4    Eggs                          

MMMMM---------------------FOR COOKING WATER--------------------------
      1 tb Oil                            
 
  Combine 4 eggs, 2 teaspoons oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt in bowl and
  whisk until well blended. Add flour, a little at a time, beating
  after each addition. Turn out onto well-floured board and knead
  several minutes until dough is firm and smooth but not dry. Add more
  flour if necessary to prevent sticking. Cover and let stand at
  slightly warm temperature about 30 minutes to ripen. Cut dough in
  2-inch portions and roll out slightly to flatten enough to fit into
  pasta machine. Roll in machine starting with thickest setting and
  progressing to next to finest setting until pasta is very thin
  (expansion takes place during cooking). Continue until all dough is
  rolled into strips. Place strips on floured board and sprinkle
  lightly with flour. Cut in 4-inch squares and let rest 10 minutes
  before filling and cooking.
  
  Meanwhile, to make sauce, saute onion and garlic in olive oil until
  golden. Add undrained tomatoes, basil and 2 teaspoons salt. Season
  with pepper to taste. Bring to boil and simmer 15 minutes. Add sugar
  at last minute.
  
  To make filling, combine ricotta, drained spinach, nutmeg, 4 eggs and
  Parmesan to taste in bowl and mix well. Season to taste with salt and
  pepper.
  
  Bring large pot of generously salted water to boil. Add 1 tablespoon
  oil. Drop each piece of pasta into boiling water and cook 3 to 4
  minutes, or just until pasta floats to surface. Remove at once and
  plunge into bowl filled with ice water 1 minute. Drain pasta on clean
  cloth to prevent sticking. Place 1 tablespoon filling in center of
  each pasta square. Fold square into triangle, then again into smaller
  triangle. Press edges to seal. Pour layer of tomato sauce in large
  baking pan. Arrange cappellacci in rows, slightly overlapping. Cover
  with remaining sauce and sprinkle with additional Parmesan cheese.
  Bake at 400F 5 to 7 minutes.

      Title: Spinach/cheese Stromboli
 Categories: Italian, Vegetable
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 pk Yeast                               1 c  Parmesan
      2 lb Ricotta                             3 tb Butter; in pieces
      2 ts Sugar                             1/2 lb Mozzarella, sliced
      1 pk Spinach, frozen chopped             1 ts Salt
           -(cooked)                           2 tb Butter; melted
    1/3 c  -Warm water                         1 c  -Ice water (without cubes)
      4 c  Flour                                    Sesame seeds
 
  Preheat oven to 200 degrees for 15 minutes and turn off.  Combine
  yeast, sugar and warm water in a small mixing bowl.  Set aside for 5
  minutes until foamy.  In the workbowl of a food processor, add flour,
  butter pieces and salt. Process for 20 seconds.  Add ice water to
  yeast.  With the processor running, add yeast-water mixture
  gradually, until all of the moisture is absorbed and the dough leaves
  the side of the bowl. Process for an additional 60 seconds.  Transfer
  dough from the workbowl to a large greased mixing bowl. Cover with a
  kitchen towel and place in warm off oven. Allow to rise until
  doubled, approximately 1-1/2 hours.
  
  In a medium mixing bowl, combine ricotta, spinach and parmesan cheese.
  
  Punch down the risen dough and transfer to a floured rolling surface.
  With quick, hard strokes, roll dough into a large rectangle, approx-
  imately 1/2 inch thick.  Layer one-half of the mozzarella cheese
  evenly down the center leaving approximately three inches of exposed
  dough on either side. Top with ricotta-spinach mixture and the
  remaining mozza- rella. Overlap the exposed dough over the cheese
  mixture and pinch well on all sides to seal.
  
  Transfer to a large cookie sheet, seam side up.  Cover with a kitchen
  towel and return to the warmed oven. Allow to rise until doubled, ap-
  proximately 45 minutes. Brush loaf with melted butter and sprinkle
  with sesame seeds. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes or until
  loaf is well browned and hollow sounding when thumped.

  remaining sugar together in a mixer fitted with a paddle. Add the
  eggs 1 at a time, waiting until the previous 1 has been absorbed. Add
  the sour cream and mix until incorporated. Add vanilla, nutmeg,
  baking soda and salt. Decrease the speed to medium, add remaining
  flour and mix an additional minute. Scrape the batter into a 1-quart
  round or rectangular cake pan, leaving 1/2-inch space at the top.
  Place on the middle rack of the oven for 50-to-60 minutes. The cake
  is done when the surface cracks and a toothpick inserted into the
  center comes out clean. Remove cake from the oven and let cool for 15
  minutes before unmolding onto rack. When the cake is completely cool,
  slice it into 6 layers. Place the first layer on a cake platter and
  sprinkle with some of the rum. Cover the layer with some of the
  custard mixture. Place the second layer on top of the custard,
  sprinkle with rum and cover with more custard. Continue until the
  cake is assembled. Lightly spread the custard all over the surface of
  the cake. Refrigerate for 2 hours before serving.

 Categories: Salsa/sauce, Meat, Pasta
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 oz Dried mushrooms                     1 tb Finely minced shallots
     12 oz Assorted fresh mushrooms                 -=OR=- Onions
           - (chanterelle, cultivated,       1/2 ts Salt
           - shiitake, oyster)               1/4 c  Sherry or Madeira
      2 tb Unsalted butter                   1/2 c  Whipping cream
      1 tb Finely minced garlic           
 
  This sauce has an intensely woodsy flavor that would be good on pasta,
  roast chicken or pork.
  
  TO RECONSTITUTE DRIED MUSHROOMS, place them in a bowl and cover with
  3 cups of warm water. Soak for at least 2 hours or up to 8. When
  mushrooms are soft, drain and reserve water and squeeze out as much
  water as you can from the mushrooms. Pour the mushroom water through
  a double layer of cheesecloth or a cloth towel to remove any sand
  that may have been lurking in the mushrooms. Reserve 1 cup of liquid
  for this recipe. (Pour the remaining mushroom water into a plastic
  container or airtight bag, label and freeze for up to a year to use
  in soups and sauces.) Wash the fresh mushrooms and pat dry. (Slice
  chanterelles and cultivated mushrooms, trim and discard the stems of
  shiitake mushrooms, and trim and discard root tips of oyster
  mushrooms.) Melt the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat and
  add the reconstituted dried mushrooms, garlic, shallots and salt.
  Cook, stirring, for 10 minutes. Add the fresh mushrooms and continue

      2 x  Lour                           
 
  Allow 3 enchiladas per person. Use a Pyrex utility pan (13-1/2" x
  8-3/4") to cook them. Lightly grease the utility pan (for
  authenticity use lard). Preheat the oven to 400. Chop onions and
  grate cheese. Saute the onions lightly in 2 T. oil. Melt lard in a
  skillet; stir in the flour and make a light roux. Add ground chiles
  or chile powder, water and salt, and cook until thick. Of commercial
  chile powders, Gebhardt's from San Antonio is best, but not as good
  as ground *chiles pasillas*. Heat the remaining oil in a skillet.
  Using kitchen tongs, dip each tortilla in hot oil until well softened
  (about 15 seconds). Hold tortilla up and allow oil to drip back into
  the skillet. Using the tongs, dip tortillas in chili gravy. Place the
  tortilla in the Pyrex pan, put a good-sized pinch of cheese and
  onions in the middle, and roll the tortilla, placing the flap side
  down. Continue filling and rolling tortillas until the pan is full.
  Pour more chili gravy on top of the enchiladas, sprinkle the top
  generously with more grated cheese, and pop into preheated oven. Cook
  only until the cheese begins to bubble (about 10 minutes). Serve
  immediately.

MMMMM---------------------SEA FOAM FROSTING--------------------------
      2    Egg whites                        1/3 c  COCA-COLA
  1 1/2 c  (firmly packed) light               1 ts Vanilla extract

    1/8 ts Cream of tartar *              
 
  *  Do not use a mix with pudding added or which requires oil.
  
  *  you may substitute 1 tablespoon corn syrup.
  
  TO MAKE THE CAKE:  In a large mixing bowl, combine the cake mix,
  baking soda, and eggs.  Measure the Coca-Cola, stir briskly until the
  foaming stops; add to the batter.  Blend ingredients just until
  moistened, then beat at high speed of an electric mixer for 3
  minutes, scraping the bowl often.
  
  In a bowl, combine the mashed bananas with the lemon juice; add to the
  batter.  Add the chopped nuts to the batter and beat for 1 minute at
  medium speed.  Turn the batter into a well-greased, lightly floured,
  13x9x2-inch pan.
  
  Bake in a preheated, 350 degree F oven for about 40 minutes or until
  the cake tests done.  Cool on a rack for 15 minutes, remove cake from
  pan and turn right-side up on a rack to finish cooling.
  
  TO MAKE THE SEA FOAM FROSTING:  In the top of a double boiler,
  combine all the ingredients except the vanilla extract.  Beat 1
  minute at high speed of an electric mixer.  Place over boiling water
  (the water should not touch the bottom of the top half of the double
  boiler.). Beat on high speed about 7 minutes until the frosting forms
  peaks when the mixer is raised.
  
  Remove from boiling water (for the smoothest frosting, empty into a
  large bowl).  Add the vanilla extract and continue beating on high
  speed until thick enough to spread, about 2 minutes.  Spread on the
  sides and top of the cold banana cake.

  This cake is remarkable; no one would ever believe that it is so low
  in fat and calories. Depending on the sweetness of the fruit you use
  to garnish the cake, you may wish to increase or decrease the sugar
  in the lemon syrup. (By Times Food Stylists) Combine nonfat milk and
  poppy seeds in a bowl. Let stand about 15 minutes. Stir in pear
  puree, egg white, vanilla and lemon zest. Sift together cake flour,
  3/4 cup sugar and baking powder in another bowl. Stir nonfat milk
  mixture just until blended. Pour into 9-inch indented, fluted
  shortcake pan sprayed with non-stick vegetable spray. Bake at 375
  degrees F. about 20 minutes or until cake tests done in the center.
  Let cool in pan 5 minutes. Loosen edges and turn out onto wire rack
  with wax paper underneath. Combine remaining 1/4 cup sugar and lemon
  juice in small sauce pan. Heat to boiling. Simmer about 1 minute or
  until syrup is clear. Brush syrup over top and sides of cake while
  cake is still warm. Place cake on serving platter. Arrange
  raspberries, kiwi wedges and papaya balls in attractive arrangement

      2    Egg whites                     
 
  Raisin Puree is the basis for the dough of this rich-tasting, chewy
  bar. The combination of orange and chocolate is a classic favorite. We
  considered cutting the amount of chocolate in the recipe, thereby
  cut- ting the fat, but in the end we agreed that the extra richness
  is worth the extra grams of fat. (By Times Food Stylists) Sift
  together flour, baking powder and salt into large bowl. Stir in oats
  and brown sugar. Beat egg whites lightly in another bowl. Stir in
  Raisin Puree. Stir into flour mixture along with chocolate, walnuts,
  and orange zest just until blended. Spoon in 9-inch-square baking pan
  sprayed with non-stick vegetable spray. Bake at 350 degrees F. 25 to

    1/8 ts Cream of tartar                 1 1/2 ts Ground anise seeds
 
  The flavor of anise in these light cookies makes them a great after-
  dinner dessert. Some people prefer the center to be soft and chewy,
  but if you prefer the dry melt-in-your-mouth type of meringue, turn
  off the oven and, with the door closed, let them stand 30 minutes to
  an hour. These cookies are generally baked on parchment paper, but we
  have found that regular bond paper makes a very acceptable
  substitute. (By Times Food Stylists) Beat egg whites until frothy.
  Add cream of tartar and beat to soft peaks. Gradually beat in sugar.
  Continue beating until stiff and glossy. Beat in anise. Using pastry
  bag, pipe onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake at 275 degrees F.
  30 minutes. Makes about 4 dozen kisses. NOTE: If drier meringue is
  desired, turn off oven and let kisses stand in oven with door closed
  about 1 hour. Each kiss contains about: 9 calories; 4 mg sodium; 0

  2-2 1/2 tb very cold water The low-calorie rice pudding flan is so
  delicious by itself that you may want to save the calories and fat in
  the crust, and serve it without the pastry. Bring nonfat milk to boil
  in medium saucepan. Add vanilla bean and rice. Cover partially and
  simmer until rice is almost tender, about 20 to 30 minutes, stirring
  occasionally. Stir in sugar and continue and continue cooking 3
  minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Remove vanilla bean.
  Blend egg substitute with ricotta cheese. Stir into rice mixture with
  candied ginger. Carefully pour into prepared pastry shell, filling
  almost to the top (if there is any flan mixture left from incomplete
  reduction in cooking, place in small custard dish, cover and
  microwave 40 to 60 seconds or until set.) Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon
  cinnamon. Bake at 400 degrees F. 25 to 30 minutes or until set.
  Remove from oven. Sift powdered sugar over and sprinkle with

  calories; 102 mg sodium; 11 mg cholesterol; 4 grams fat; 31 grams

  is easily patched. Low-Fat Sweet Pastry Sift flour, cardamom and
  sugar into large bowl. Rub in butter with fingers or cut in with
  pastry blender until size of small peas. Using fork, stir in oil.

  flour is moistened without being wet. Gather dough with moist hands,
  shape into flattened round and let rest about 15 minutes. Roll
  1/8-inch thick on lightly floures board. (To facilitate rolling,
  dough may also be rolled between sheets of wax paper Or unrolled
  dough may be placed in pan and gently pressed  to cover inside of
  pan.) Gently lift and press onto 9-inch square tart pan with
  removable bottom. Cut off dough edges. Bake at 425 degrees F. 10 to
  15 minutes or until golden brown. Makes 12 servings. NOTE: Unsalted
  butter will give a more delicate fresh flavor in this pastry. Add a
  dash of salt if using.

      1 lg Egg yolk beaten with           
 
  In a roasting pan, roast the beef in the middle of a preheated 400f
  oven for 25-30 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers 120f.
  Let the fillet cool completely and discard the larding fat and
  strings. Skim the fat from the pan juices and reserve the juices. In
  a heavy skillet, cook the mushrooms in butter over mod-low heat,
  stirring, until all liquid they give off is evaporated and the
  mixture is dry. Season with salt and pepper and let cool completely.
  Spread the fillet evenly with foie gras, covering the top and sides,
  and spread the mushrooms evenly over the foie gras. On a floured
  surface, roll one lb. of puff pastry into a rectangle about 20x12
  inches, or large enough to enclose the roast completely. Invert the
  fillet in the middle of the pastry and fold up the long sides to
  enclose it, brushing the edges of the dough with some egg white to
  seal them. Fold the ends of the dough over the fillet and seal with
  the egg white. Transfer the fillet, seam side down, to a jelly-roll
  pan and brush the dough with egg wash.  Roll out additional dough and
  cut out shapes with which to decorate the dough. After applying,
  brush with egg wash. Chill for at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours.
  Bake the fillet in the middle of a preheated 400f oven for 30 minutes.
   Reduce heat to 350f and bake an additional 5-10 minutes more or
  until a meat thermometer registers 130f for medium rare meat and the
  pastry is cooked through.  Let stand for 15 minutes. In a saucepan,
  boil the reserved pan juices and the Madeira until the mixture is
  reduced by one fourth. Add the arrowroot mixture, broth, truffles,
  and salt and pepper to taste. Cook the sauce over moderate heat,
  stirring, for 5 minutes or until thickened, being careful not to let
  it boil. Loosen the fillet from the pan, transfering it to a heated
  platter. Garnish with watercress. Serve the fillet cut into 3/4-inch

      3    Shallots, minced                    1    Egg yolk, hard cooked, mashe
      2    Rosemary                                 -
      2    Lemon slices                        1 ts Unsalted butter
      3    Celery leaves                  
 
  In a small saucepan, combine the wine, basil, 3 tarragon sprigs,
  shallots, rosemary, lemon, and celery.  Simmer the mixture for 20
  minutes or until the liquid is reduced to about 3 Tbsp. Lay the
  salmon on a piece of heavy foil, twice as long as the fish. Pick up
  edges of foil and pour the wine mixture over the fish. Season with
  salt and fold the foil to enclose it, crimping the edges tightly to
  secure them. Put the salmon on a large baking sheet or roasting pan
  and bake it in the middle of a preheated 375f oven for 50-60 minutes
  or until the fish just flakes. Transfer the package to a work
  surface, open foil carefully, and remove the skin from the top of the
  salmon below the head to the bottom of the salmon at the tail. Scrape
  away any brown flesh, leaving head and tail intact. Drain liquid from
  the foil, and using the foil as a guide, invert the fish onto a
  platter. Remove foil and skin and prepare the other side of the
  salmon in the same manner. Chill the fish, covered, overnight. Peel
  turnip and cut into thin slices. Trim each slice to ressemble a
  flower or cut with a flower cutter. Place in a bowl of ice water to
  hold until ready for use. Mash the egg yolk with the butter and
  reserve at room temperature. Spoon a thin coat of cool but liquid
  fish aspic over the salmon and arrange the additional tarragon sprigs
  and turnip flowers decoratively on the fish. Spoon a thin coat of
  liquid aspic over the whole. Transfer the yolk mixture to a pastry
  bag fitted with a decorative tip. Pipe the mixture into the centers
  of the flowers. Chill the salmon for at least 2 hours or up to 6
  hours. Serve surrounded with the chilled aspic, chopped. a 1964

  1 1/2 c  Heavy cream, well chilled           3 tb Peach schnapps
           Genoise cake (see recipe)      
 
  Halve, pit, and chop nectarines and, in a heavy saucepan, combine
  them with sugar and 1/2 cup water.  Bring to a boil, stirring, and
  cook it at a slow boil, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes.  In a
  food processor, puree the mixture and force it through a fine sieve
  into a large bowl, pressing hard on the solids.
  
  In a small saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over the lemon juice and
  schnapps, let it soften for 5 minutes, then heat mixture over low
  heat, stirring, until gelatin has dissolved.  Stir gelatin into
  nectarine puree, blending the mixture well.  Let it cool to room
  temperature.
  
  In a chilled bowl, beat the cream until it holds soft shapes, (not as
  stiff as soft peaks) and fold it into the nectarine mixture.
  
  Trim the Genoise and cut it into three layers, horizonally.
  
  Peach Syrup:    In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and 1/4 cup
  water. Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved, and stir
  in the schnapps.  Let the syrup cool to room temperature. Assembly:
  Center one layer in the bottom of a 9-1/2-inch springform pan and
  brush with half the peach syrup.  Pour half the mousse over the cake
  and top it with another layer of Genoise.  Brush with the remaining
  peach syrup and pour the remaining mousse over the cake, rapping on
  the side of the pan to expel any air bubbles and smoothing the
  surface. Chill for 2 hours, or until it is set.
  
  Peach Glaze:    In a small bowl, sprinkle gelatin over 3 Tbsp cold
  water and let it soften for 5 minutes.  In a small saucepan, combine
  the preserves and schnapps, bring mixture to a boil, stirring, and
  simmer it for 1 minute.  Remove pan from heat, add gelatin mixture,
  stirring until gelatin is dissolved, and strain the mixture through a
  fine sieve into a bowl, pressing hard on the solids.
  
  Assembly:      Pour all but about 2 Tbsp of Peach Glaze over top of
  the mousse cake, covering it completely, and chill the cake for 2
  hours, or until glaze is set.
  
  While cake is chilling, in a food processor, grind the remaining
  Genoise layer into fine crumbs.  Toast the crumbs in a jelly-roll pan
  in a preheated 350f oven for 5-8 minutes or until they are golden.
  Reserve.
  
  Cut half the nectarine into thin slices, and arrange them
  decoratively on top of the cake in a pinwheel pattern.  Brush the
  remaining glaze over the nectarine slices and chill the cake,
  covered, for 1 hour, or until the newly applied glaze is set.
  
  Run a thin knife around the edge of the pan and remove the side of
  the pan. Working over a sheet of wax paper, coat sides of cake with
  the cake crumbs.
  
  Let cake stand at room temperature for 20 minutes before serving.

  1 1/2 c  Sugar                               5 lg Egg yolks
      1 pn Cream of tartar                     2 tb Fresh lemon juice
  3 1/2 c  Milk                                1 tb Lemon zest
      1 c  Heavy cream                         1 ts Vanilla
      5 lg Eggs                           
 
  In a small heavy saucepan, combine 3/4 cup of sugar, cream of tartar,
  and 1/4 cup water. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring until the
  sugar is dissolved.  Boil the syrup, covered, for 1 minute.  Remove
  the lid and boil the syrup, undisturbed, until it begins to turn
  golden. Continue to boil the syrup, swirling it and tilting the pan,
  until it is deep golden caramel.  Pour the caramel into a 9x5 loaf
  pan, tilt the pan to coat the bottom and sides, and let it cool.
  
  In a large saucepan, scald the milk with the cream over moderate heat.
   In a large heatproof bowl, whisk together the whole eggs, egg yolks
  , and the remaining sugar, until the mixture is light and frothy.
  Add the scalded milk in a slow stream, stirring constantly, and stir
  in the lemon juice, zest, and vanilla.  Set the pan in a larger
  deeper baking pan and strain the custard mixture into the loaf pan.
  Cover the loaf pan with heavy-duty foil and add enough hot water to
  the larger pan so that it reaches 2/3 of the way up the outside of
  the loaf pan.
  
  Bake the custard in the middle of a preheated 325f oven for 80
  minutes. Remove the loaf pan from the larger one and remove the foil.
   (The custard will not appear set in the middle but it will set as it
  cools.)
  
  Let the custard cool and then chill it, covered, overnight.  Run a
  thin knife around the edge of the custard, invert a serving plate
  over it and invert the custard onto the plate.

  Carefully remove the shells from the shrimp, leaving the tail sections
  intact. Devein and wash under cold running water; pat dry with paper
  towels.  In a dish or bowl, marinate briefly in a mixture of the
  vodka, salt, and pepper while you make the batter.
  
  In a mixing, put the flour and baking powder; gradually add the cold
  water, whisking until smooth.
  
  In a wok, heat the 2 cup of oil until it reaches 350 degrees F.  Add 1
  tablespoon of the hot oil to the batter and stir to combine.  Take a
  shrimp by the tail and dip it into the batter (do not dip the tail),
  then slide it into the hot oil. Deep-fry all the shrimp, a few at a
  time, until golden brown. This should take about 2 minutes for each
  batch. Drain on paper towels, and serve tails up, in a serving dish,
  with the salt/pepper mixture for dipping. Makes 8 to 10 appetizer
  servings.
  
  FOR DIPPING:  In a bowl, combine coarse salt and the peppercorns.  In
  a dry frying pan over high heat, brown the salt/pepper mixture.  When
  browned remove and run the mixture through a grinder.

  the eggs, but if it does not, baste frequently.
  
  Turn off the heat and let the eggs stand in the another hour, turning
  them from time to time, to ensure even coloring.  Serve cut into
  halves or quarters, with dipping sauce.  Makes 6 to 8 appetizer
  servings.

      1 pk Active dry yeast                    2 tb Honey
      1 tb Kosher (or regular) salt            1    Egg white lightly beaten
  1 1/2 c  Warm water (110 to 115         
 
  In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine 1 cup of the flour, the
  yeast and salt.  Add the water and honey and beat until smooth. Add
  the remaining flour,1 cup at a time, to make a soft dough. Turn the
  dough out onto a generously floured board and continue working on the
  flour until the dough is stiff enough to knead. Knead until smooth
  and elastic, 5 to 10 minutes. Cover with a towel and let rise 15
  minutes. Divide the dough into 8 to 12 equal portions.  Shape each
  portion into a flattened ball. With your forefinger, poke a hole in
  the center. Stretch and rotate the dough until the hole is 1 1/2 to 2
  inches wide. Place the bagels on a well-floured board, cover with
  another towel, and let them rise for 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 375
  degrees. Fill a large shallow pan (a wok works well) with 3 inches of
  water. Bring the water to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer. Add a
  few bagels at a time and simmer for 5 minutes (turning once or
  twice). Remove the bagels from the pan with a slotted spoon and drain
  on a towel. Place the bagels on well-oiled baking sheets, brush with
  egg white and sprinkle with topping of your choice. Bake for 30
  minutes, until well browned.  Transfer to racks to cool. SUGGESTED
  TOPPINGS: Kosher salt, finely chopped onions or garlic, poppy, sesame
  or caraway seeds.

      Title: Chicken Szechuan-Style with Sesame Paste
 Categories: Chinese, Poultry, Appetizer, Chicken
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2    Whole chicken beasts,               3    Slices fresh ginger, minced
           Skinned and boned                   1    Scallion (white part only),
      2 tb Szechuan peppercorns                     Chopped
      4 tb Sesame paste                        1 cl Garlic, minced fine
      3 tb Green tea                       1 1/2 tb Dry sherry or
      2 tb Wine vinegar                             Shaoshing wine
  2 1/2 ts Soy sauce                         1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
      3 tb Peanut oil                               Lettuce leaves
      2 ts Crushed red pepper *           
 
  *  or you substitute 2 whole chili peppers, crushed. In a pot, poach
  the chicken breasts in a little boiling water for 10 minutes until
  white and opaque. In a dry frying pan, toast the Szechuan peppercorns
  over moderate heat, then crust or grind them; set aside. Remove the
  chicken breasts from the pot, drain and cool them.  Slice them, then
  shred the slices into julienne pieces. In a mixing bowl, combine the
  sesame paste and green tea (or the peanut butter and sesame oil --
  See NOTE). Add the vinegar and soy sauce; blend well. Add the peanut
  oil, red pepper, ginger, scallion, garlic, sherry, cayenne pepper,
  and the peppercorns. Mix all ingredients very well. Toss the chicken
  strips in this sauce, to coat. Refrigerate until 20 minutes before
  serving. Pass the chicken and the lettuce leaves separately, and let
  each guest place a small portion of the chicken in the middle of a
  lettuce leaf and roll it up like an egg roll to eat using fingers.
  Makes 6 appetizer servings.
  
  NOTE:  The authentic recipe calls for green tea to thin the sesame
  seed paste,
       but you may substitute chicken broth, or simply water, if you
  prefer.
       Another substitution you may make if you wish is peanut butter
  for the
       sesame seed paste along with sesame oil instead of green tea.
       This dish is served cold or at room temperature and can be made
  a day
       ahead . -- Verdi

      2 tb Dry sherry or                            (optional)
           Shaoshing wine                

MMMMM-----------------------DIPPING SAUCE----------------------------
           Plum sauce                               Scallion, chopped
 
  Preheat the oven 10 375 degree F. Trim any excess fat from the ribs
  and place them in a long shallow dish. In a mixing bowl, combine the
  marinade ingredients; if you are using 5-spice powder, add it to the
  mixture by putting it through a tea strainer so it spreads out over
  the mixture. Mix well, and pour over the ribs and leave for 3 hours
  at room temperature or about 6 hours in the refrigerator.  Baste the
  ribs every hours or so, turning them over. TO ROAST THE RIBS: Remove
  the ribs from the marinade. Add the 1/4 cup plum sauce to the
  marinade; reserve it for basting. Hook metal drapery hooks through
  both ends of each rack of ribs, at the top, and hang each one as if
  you were hanging a hammock, suspended from the bars of one of the
  oven racks.  Set the oven rack in the highest position in the oven.
  On the floor of the oven or on another oven rack set at the lowest
  position in the oven, place a baking pan half filled with water, to
  collect drippings and prevent smoking. You may want to line the
  baking pan with aluminum foil before putting the water in, to make it
  easier to clean. Roast the spareribs for 45 minutes in the preheated
  oven.  Then baste them with the reserved basting sauce, using a small
  pastery brush and carefully pulling out the oven rack to facilitate
  the basting process. Turn the oven up to 450 degrees F and roast for
  another 15 minutes.  By this time the spareribs should be a rich
  golden brown with crisp edges.  Baste again, then take them out of
  the oven.  Place the ribs on a cutting board and remove the drapery
  hooks.  Separate the individual ribs with a cleaver or sharp knife.
  Serve at room temperature, with dipping sauce.  Makes 6 to 8
  appetizer servings. NOTE: You will need about 12 drapery hooks.

      Title: Parchment-Wrapped Chicken
 Categories: Chinese, Poultry, Appetizer, Chicken
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      4    Scallions, green tops only          1 ts Sugar
      2    Whole chicken beast                 2 ts Oil
      1 ts Ginger juice (see below)           24    Squares (6-in) parchment
      2 ts Dry sherry or                            (see NOTE)
           Shaoshing wine                      2 c  Oil, for deep-frying
      2 ts Light soy sauce                          Hoisin sauce, for dipping
      1 ts Salt                           
 
  Shred the scallions lengthwise and then cut into 1-1/2 inch lengths.
  Cut the chicken breasts into strips 1/4 inch wide by 1-1/2 inches in
  length. Squeeze enough fresh ginger in a garlic press to render 1
  teaspoon of ginger juice. In a bowl, combine the ginger juice with
  the sherry/wine, scallion strips, soy sauce, salt and sugar, to make
  a marinade for the chicken strips.  Let the chicken marinate for at
  least 10 minutes. Place a square of parchment in front of you, with a
  corner toward you. Rub a bit of oil o the center of the paper.  Place
  a little of the chicken and a bit of the scallion on the paper
  horizontally, well below the center of the angled square.  Fold the
  lower corner up to cover the meat, then fold the left corner over to
  the right and the right corner over to left, to make a small
  envelope. Fold the top corner down and tuck it in securely. Repeat
  the process for the other 23 pieces of paper, using the rest of the
  chicken and scallions. In wok or deep fryer, heat the oil to 375
  degrees F. Deep fry the envelopes in the hot oil for 1 minute on each
  side. Remove with a slotted spoon or a strainer, and drain on paper
  towels. Serve with hoisin sauce. NOTE: Deep-frying foods in a
  wrapping of paper is a Chinese trick. The paper
       acts like a batter coating, to protect and insulate the
  ingredient
       against the hot oil.
       Use cooking parchment or rice paper; other suitable papers are
       available in cooking-supply houses.  The paper must be porous;
  never
       use aluminum foil or plastic cling wrap. -- Verdi

    1/2 ts Garlic, chopped                     1 tb Red wine vinegar
      1 ts Salt                                5 tb Olive oil, extra virgin

  1 1/4    Head red tip lettuce              1/2    Head radicchio
 
  In a pan in hot corn oil, deep-fry the wonton skins, one at a time
  until crisp, about 15 seconds per side (do not allow oil to smoke).
  Set aside. In a bowl, thoroughly mix the goat cheese, cream cheese,
  sour cream, chives, parsley, thyme, garlic, and shallots. Season to
  taste with the freshly ground pepper. Set aside. TO PREPARE THE
  DRESSING: In an electric blender, place the mustard, garlic, salt,

  quarter of the egg mixture to cover the bottom of the skillet.  Heat
  until the egg pancake has barely set, then transfer to a plate.  Make
  3 more pancakes. Divide the filling into 4 portions and put a
  portions on each pancake. Moisten your fingers with cold water and
  spread the filling mixture evenly over the surface of the pancake,
  then roll up tightly, as you would a jelly roll. Seal with a little
  leftover egg from the egg-beating bowl.  Place the rolls on a flat
  plate that will fit your steamer, and then steam them over an inch of
  simmering water for 15 minutes. In a bowl, mix together the sauce
  ingredients.  To serve, cut the rolls into slices, cutting on the
  slant. Drizzle the sauce over them and top with the scallion greens
  and the carrots.  Makes 6 to 8 appetizer servings.

  Place in blender a cup or so at a time. Puree each batch and empty
  into large bowl. Rinse pot, replace soup mixture and again bring to
  simmer again for a few minutes, stirring occassionally.
  
  Note: At this stage, we allow the mixture to sit until it cools
  slightly and divide the soup into 3 equal portions. The soup freeezs
  excellently and we do that with 2 of the portions.
  
  Variations: Place the basic soup into a pot. Simmer and bring to a
  boil. Add a quarter cup of milk either regular or skimmed) and bring
  to boil again.  To add texture to the mix, add diced potatoes and
  carrots. *Serve with a pinch of dried tarragon*. A a dollop of no fat
  yogurt adds additional smoothness.
  
  If desired, substitute 1/2 cup of cooked fucilli instead of the
  potato. You may also substitute frozen corn or peas.

      1 lb Chicken livers                           Peeled
    1/2 c  Schmaltz or Nyafat                  2 tb Brandy

      Title: Thousand-Year-Old Eggs
 Categories: Chinese, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      2 c  Very strong black tea                    From fireplace
    1/3 c  Salt                                1 c  Lime*
      2 c  Each ashes of pine wood,           12    Fresh duck eggs
           Ashes of charcoal and ashes    
 
      These are often called thousand-year eggs, even though the
  preserving process lasts only 100 days. They may be purchased
  individually in Oriental markets.
  
      Combine tea, salt, ashes and lime. Using about 1/2 cup per egg,
  thickly coat each egg completely with this clay-like mix- ture. Line
  a large crock with garden soil and carefully lay coated eggs on top.
  Cover with more soil and place crock in a cool dark place. Allow to
  cure for 100 days. To remove coating, scrape eggs and rinse under
  running water to clean thoroughly.
   Crack lightly and remove shells. The white of the egg will appear a
  grayish, translucent color and have a gelatinous texture. The yolk,
  when sliced, will be a grayish-green color.
  
      To serve, cut into wedges and serve with:
  
      Sweet pickled scallions or any sweet pickled vegetable
  
      Sauce of 2 tablespoons each vinegar, soy sauce and rice wine and 1
  tablespoon minced ginger root.
  
      *Available in garden stores and nurseries.
  
      The description of the whites turning grayish isn't quite
  accurate from the ones I've seen. They're more a dark blackish amber
  color-- quite attractive actually.

      Title: Succulent Salmon  (C) 1992 George Gilder
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 2 servings
 
     10 oz Salmon fillet                            Broccoli, cut into florets
           (remove the skin)                   1 tb Olive oil
      2 md Red potatoes                      1/4 ts Thyme
      1 lg Onions, sliced 1/4 inch           1/2 ts Basil
      8    Baby carrots or 8 carrot            1 pk Herb-ox low salt
           Sections, cut into 2"                    Chicken stock mix
           Pieces                                   Salt, pepper,to taste
    1/4 c  Fresh orange juice             
 
  This is a new adaptation from a series of fish recipes I developed for
  "people who don't like fish". The stock and juice combined with the
  onion add a distinctive savory flavor. The combination makes it hard
  to distinguish the individual flavors. This dinner takes less than
  ten minutes to complete.
  
  Cut the potatoes into one quarter inch slices and place into a pan of
  cold water. Turn pot on high until it starts to boil. Add the carrots
  after three minutes. Salt the water and reduce heat to medium. Cook
  until tender, about six to seven minutes. Add broccoli about 2
  minutes before the potatoes are finished. Drain if finished before
  the fish, and place back in hot pan. Add fresh pepper.
  
  Saute onions in one half the oil, med-low heat in a ten inch teflon
  pan. When they start to brown add the rest of oil. Place the fish
  fillet on top fat side down and turn up heat to med- high. Saute
  until salmon turns white on bottom. Add herbs and pepper. Add one
  quarter cup of water, chicken stock and the orange juice. Lower heat
  and simmer about five minutes. Baste occasionally. The salmon should
  be pink inside and not over done.
  
  Cut the filet in half in the pan. Using a plastic spatula, pick up
  the fish and onions and place in one half of plate. Add a spoon or
  two of sauce. Add vegetables and arrange in semi-circle.

      Title: Tomato Sauce
 Categories: Salsa/sauce
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lg Can tomatoes (cheapest is                (optional - only if you
           Best here, since they're                 Like it)
           Soupy to start with)              1/4 c  Best olive oil
      2    Dead-ripe, peeled, fresh            8 oz Contadina tomato sauce
           Tomatoes (optional - if             6 oz Can Contadina tomato paste
           They're in season, else           1/2 ts Salt
           Don't bother)                     1/4 ts Dried oregano
      1    Onion, chopped                           Minced fresh basil, to
      2 cl Garlic, minced                           Taste (hard to have too
      1 sm Bell pepper, red or green                Much basil)
 
  Heat the olive oil in a large pot, and saute the onions and green
  pepper until soft.  Add the garlic and saute another minute or two.
  Coarsely chop the fresh tomatoes, add them to the pot and cook,
  stirring, until they begin to give up their juice.  Coarsely chop the
  canned tomatoes and add them, along with the tomato sauce and tomato
  past.  Stir in the seasonings, cover the pot and simmer the sauce
  over low heat 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  
  The Contadina tomato sauce and paste have significantly better flavor
  than any others I know of.  If you can't get Contadina, then a small
  shake of tobasco will help (not enough to make it hot, just enough to
  give it a little sparkle).
  
  For all those people who THINK they can't make a pie crust, here is a
  quick, easy, and CHEAP pie crust recipe.  I think the trick is the
  boiling water and fluffing the shortening with a fork so that it
  disperses evenly throughout the flour.

      Title: Never-Fail Pie Crust
 Categories: Pie/tart
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Crisco or other GOOD                     Pinch of salt
           Shortening                          3 c  Flour.
    1/2 c  Boiling water                  
 
  Mix shortening, salt and boiling water in a large bowl. Whip with a
  fork until fluffy.  Add the flour all at once.  Stir until it leaves
  the side of the bowl.  Roll between two sheets of wax paper.  Makes
  enough for a two-crust pie.  If using for two one-crust pies, bake at
  375 10-12 minutes or until light brown before adding filling.
  
  This also freezes well if made up ahead, if you like to have pie
  shells on hand for one-crust pies.

  Dice bacon. Add onion and fry until bacon is crisp.  Add peas and
  rice, then water.  Cover and simmer over low heat for about 20
  minutes or until rice is tender.  ( I *ALWAYS* add a good sized shake
  or two of Louisiana Hot sauce (NOT Tabasco, there is a difference)
  Yields 10 servings
  
  This is the basic recipe (from Southern Living)  It can be adjusted in
  several ways:
  
  1)  substitute ham hocks for bacon by boiling them in the 2 C water
  until the meat comes off the bone.  Fry onion in bacon grease until
  yellow. Or use any fatty pork meat: trimmings from a roast or chops,
  "fat-back", etc
  
  2)  I prefer Purple-Hull Peas over the Black-eyes, But if you don't
  know the difference (or can't find them)  it's not a big deal.  It is
  important to use fresh peas, frozen if you have to...if you can only
  get canned or dried peas, nevermind and fix something else.
  
  3)  I discovered a secret to Southern style cooking: Cavender's Greek
  Seasoning.  Put a little of it in everything, along with the
  Louisiana Hot Sauce makes everything taste better.  This is what I
  would do for the greens as a regular family dinner.  Later I'll get
  out the company recipe.
  
  BTW  Southern Living is *the* Soutern magazine and has the best
  recipes for regional favorites.  They also put out an annual cookbook
  which includes all the recipes for the year.  If I keep osting them
  here y'all see that this book is a very worthwhile purchase.

 Categories: Appetizer, Seafood, Thai
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Fresh Squids.                       1 tb Fresh Ginger Root, Julienne.
      1 tb Lemongrass, Sliced Fine.            2 tb Onion, Chopped.
      3 tb Lime or Lemon Juice.                3 tb Fish Sauce.
      1 tb Scallions, Chopped.                 1 tb Cilantro, Chopped.
    1/2 c  Mint Leaves.                       10    Crushed Hot Chili Peppers.
 
  Clean and wash the fresh squids, removing all inner matters and skin.
  Cut through the side so that the meat is in a single "sheet".  Cut
  the meat into strips about 3/4" to 1" wide and 2" long.  If desired,
  slash one side in a close criss-cross patterns, and the strip will
  curl into a roll upon cooking.  Place the squid pieces into a wire
  strainer with long handle.
  
  Boil a pot of water, and immerse the strainer with the squid meat
  into the boiling water to cook.  For very fresh squid, cook until the
  meat had turned opaque and heated through.  For frozen, or "not so
  fresh" squid, it is advisable to cook a little longer.  Lift the
  squid out of the boiling water and let drain in the strainer.
  
  Place the well drained squid meat into a bowl and add fish sauce and
  lime or lemon juice.  Adjust tastes by adding more of either
  ingredients.  The tastes should be tangy sour with sufficient salty
  tastes.  Add lemongrass, ginger roots (very finely julienne), and
  chopped onions, and mix well. (Optionally, you may add dry ground hot
  chilli pepper to taste).
  
  Place on a serving platter (lined with lettuce leaves) and topped with
  chopped scallions, cilantro, mint leaves, and crushed hot chilli
  peppers.

  PS:  This makes a big cake which will keep much longer than I've ever
  seen one last.  It's also almost impossible to overbake.  A couple
  years ago I was making one as an Xmas gift for friends. I went to
  bed, forgetting to remove the cake from the oven, and it baked all
  night long. When I finally got it out of the oven (over 7 hours after
  it went in) the cake was perfectly OK except for a suface layer about
  " deep that was a bit dry. I made another cake for the gift, but my
  family gobbled the "mistake" in short order.

      1 tb Heaping whole coriander             1 ts Anchovy paste
           Seeds OR                            6    Sprigs coriander, finely
      1 tb Ground coriander                         Chopped
      1 ts Heaping whole caraway               1 ts Salt
           Seeds OR                            3 tb Vegetable oil
 
  Grind the whole spices and add any ground ones.  Into a food
  processor, pour the mixture and add the remaining ingredients (except
  for 1 tablespoon of the oil. Grind as fine as possible. Using a
  spatula, transfer the paste to a jar and pour in the last tablespoon
  of oil. Cap tightly and refrigerate until needed. Keeps 2 months in
  the refrigerator. Makes approximately 8 ounces.
  
  NOTES:  Although substitutions for hard-to-find ingredients have been
  made,
        this curry paste still carries the true flavor of Thailand.
  Use it in
        Thai curries unless otherwise specified.  A little added to
  stir-fry
        dishes or rubbed into chicken as a marinade before barbequing or
        grilling will add a real Thai accent.  A teaspoon added to a
  meatloaf
        mixture or meat balls, transforms them into something that is
  rather
        exotic, and when combined with peanut butter and coconut milk,
  it
        makes a tangy and aromatic sauce for Thai-style satays.
  
        Use whole spices whenever possible.  Anchovy fillets may be
        substituted for the anchovy paste.  Shallots are preferable to
  onions;
        if not available, use an equal amount of a red onion.

      Title: Pineapple Upside-Down Cake (Skillet)
 Categories: Cake/cookie
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 cn Pineapple Slices In Syrup         1/2 ts Salt
           (1 pound 4 ozs)                   1/2 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Butter                            1/4 c  Vegetable Oil (Or Solid
    2/3 c  Brown Sugar, Firmly Packed               Vegetable Shortening)
           Maraschino Cherries                 1 lg Egg
      1 c  Unbleached Flour, Unsifted        1/4 ts Grated Lemon Rind
    3/4 c  Granulated Sugar                    1 ts Lemon Juice
  1 1/2 ts Baking Powder                       1 ts Vanilla Extract
 
  This one may be a little strange to you, but is a classic in its own
  right. The difference between this one and the one you usually find
  in the cookbook, is that this one uses a skillet for a baking pan.
  
  Drain the pineapple, reserving 2 Tbls of the juice.  Melt the butter
  in a heavy 10-inch ovenproof skillet.  Stir in the brown sugar and
  reserved pineapple syrup, blending well.  Remove from the heat.
  Arrange the pineapple slices in the sugar mixture in a balanced
  arrangement. Place a maraschino cherry in the center of each
  pineapple slice.
  
  Combine the flour, sugars, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
  Add the milk and oil then beat, with an electric mixer set on high
  speed, for 2 minutes.  Add the egg, lemon rind, lemon juice and
  vanilla extract and beat for an additional 2 minutes.  Carefully pour
  the batter over the pineapple in the skillet, spreading evenly. Bake
  in a preheated oven for 25 minutes or until the cake tests done.
  Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Place a
  serving plate upside down on the top of the skillet and invert the
  skillet and plate. Serve this cake warm.
  
  VARIATION:
  
  For Peach Upside-Down Cake, use a can of peach halves instead of the
  pineapple slices and proceed as above.

  This is an old recipe that comes from a request in the local paper for
  "Classic Recipes".  They called the 7-Up bottling company and they
  did not even know about it.  Someone developed this on their own and
  never let the company know about it.  BTW 7-Up comes from the popular
  card game in the 1930's.
  
  Cream the margarine, shortening and sugar together beating until
  light and fluffy.  Add the eggs, one at a time, blending well after
  each addition. Beat in the flour, then beat in the extract and 7-Up.
  Blend well. Pour the batter into a well-greased and floured tube pan

      1 ts Baking Powder                       1 ts Vanilla Extract
      1 ts Baking Soda                       2/3 c  Cocoa (Less if using Dutch
    1/2 ts Salt                                     Process)
    1/2 c  Vegetable Shortening Or           1/4 c  PLUS 2 to 3 Tbls Hot Water
           Vegetable Oil                       1 c  Milk Mixed With 1 Tbls
  1 1/2 c  Sugar                                    Water (To Make Sour Milk)
 
  This has been one of the most popular cakes Hershey has ever
  introduced. I have made it since the 1950's so I would consider it a
  classic. Grease the bottoms and sides of two 9 X 1 1/2-inch layer
  cake pans and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, blending
  well, and set aside.  Cream the shortening and sugar, with an
  electric mixer set on high, and beat in the eggs and vanilla extract
  and continue beating until light and fluffy.  Blend the cocoa into
  the hot water to make a smooth paste.  Gradually add the cocoa
  mixture to the creamed mixture, stirring to blend well.  Add the
  flour mixture alternately with the milk to the creamed mixture,
  beating well after each addition. Pour the batter into the prepared
  pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the
  tops spring back when lightly pressed. Cool on racks for 10 minutes
  and remove from the pans to cool completely.  Frost with
  Chocolate-Buttercream Frosting (Next Recipe).
