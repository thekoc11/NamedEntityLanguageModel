        The following recipes were collected from a great book entitled,
"The 15 Minute Vegetarian Gourmet", by P. Mitchell (Macmillan, 1987)

        All of the recipes involve a minimum of fuss and bother. They also don't
 hit you over the head with the fact that they are vegetarian recipes.

        Hope you enjoy these. If you would like to see more, let me know!
