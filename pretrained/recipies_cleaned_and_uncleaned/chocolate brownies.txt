Preheat waffle iron. Preheat oven to 250=F8F (120=F8C). In a small,
heavy saucepan or double boiler melt chocolate and butter over low
heat.

In a medium-size bowl sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda,
granulated sugar and cocoa powder. In a large bowl beat together egg
yolks, milk, sour cream and vanilla. Gradually stir in flour mixture
and melted chocolate and butter. Beat until smooth. Stir in walnuts.
In a small bowl whip egg whites until soft peaks are formed. Fold
into batter. Batter will be thick. Lightly brush hot grids with
shortening or oil. Pour enough batter to fill two-thirds of the
waffle iron. Push batter out to the edges with a wooden spoon. Cook
until crisp and a dark rich brown. Be careful not to overcook. Keep
finished waffles warm in the oven on a rack until ready to serve.
Repeat with the remaining batter.

To serve cut waffles into quarter sections. Sprinkle powdered sugar
through a fine sieve over the top.

The Rockettes' Fudge Brownie Tart

chocolate, deserts, tarts

1/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter
1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
1/4 cup sugar
9 ounce bittersweet chocolate, chopped
1 ounce unsweetened chocolate, chopped
2  eggs
1 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts
1 tablespoon grand marnier
1/2 cup chocolate chips

Preheat the oven to 350  F. Butter and flour a 10-inch tart pan with a
removable bottom. In a medium saucepan over moderate heat, combine the
butter and the sugars. Cook, stirring constantly, until the butter is
melted, 4 to 6 minutes. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the
bittersweet and unsweetened chocolate and process until finely
chopped, 15 to 20 seconds. Add the hot butter-sugar mixture and
process for 15 more seconds. Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the
eggs and vanilla. Process to combine, about 10 seconds. Add the
flour, salt, walnuts, and Grand Marnier. Pulse briefly 10 times, just
to mix.

Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan and sprinkle the top
with chocolate chips. Bake 25 to 30 minutes; a toothpick inserted
near the center will come out moist. Do not overbake. Remove the
sides of the pan and cool on a wire rack. Cut into wedges and serve.

White Chocolate & Macadamia Nut Brownies

cakes, deserts, microwave, snacks

2/3 cup macadamia nuts
1 cup flour; plus 2 tbsp.
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1/2 cup sugar
2 tablespoon water
9 ounce white chocolate
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. If macadamia nuts are salted, blanch in
boiling water to cover for 30 seconds to remove salt. Rinse under cold
running water and transfer to a baking sheet. Toast in a 325 degrees
F oven until golden brown. Let cool, then coarsely chop. If nuts are
unsalted, just toast and chop.

2. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

3. Place butter, sugar, and water in a medium saucepan over low heat.
Cut 6 ounces of the white chocolate into large (1- or 2-inch) chunks
and the remaining 3 ounces into small (1/4-inch to 1/2-inch) chips.

4. When butter has melted, remove from heat, add the 6 ounces white
chocolate chunks and stir until chocolate melts.

5. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Stir in flour mixture until just
blended. Stir in the 3 ounces of white chocolate chips and the nuts.

6. Spread batter in a greased 8- or 9-inch square baking pan. Bake 30
to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out
clean. Cool on a wire rack, then cut into squares.

* Timesaver Tip: Brownie batter can be made ahead and frozen before
baking. Line an 8- or 9-inch square pan with heavy-duty foil. Spoon
batter into pan. Freeze batter, uncovered, until frozen solid. Remove
from pan and wrap tightly. Label and date package. Freeze at 0
degrees F up to 4 weeks. To bake, peel foil from batter and place in
greased pan. Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F oven until skewer
inserted in center comes out clean (40 to 50 minutes).

Microwave Version: Chocolate may be melted in a microwave oven. Place
butter and chocolate in a small glass bowl. Microwave on 50% power
for 1 minute, stir, then continue microwaving 1 to 3 minutes more.
Stir until smooth. Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch around
edges and won't blend smoothly. Stir in sugar and water and continue
with step 5.

prepared pan and spread it evenly with a spatula. Sprinkle the
remaining 1/2 cup of walnuts and 3 ounces of chocolate chunks over
the top of the batter. Bake the brownies for 40 to 50 minutes, or
until a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center of the
brownie comes out with a few moist crumbs clinging to it. Cool the
brownies in the pan set on a wire rack. When the brownies are
completely cool, cover the pan of brownies with plastic wrap and let

preheat to 325 F.  Line an 8-inch square baking pan with a double
thickness of aluminum foil so that the foil extends 2 inches beyond
two of the opposite ends of the pan.  Fold the overhang down to form
"handles. " Butter the bottom of the foil-lined pan. Sift flour,
baking soda, and salt through a wire strainer onto a sheet of wax
paper.

2. In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt butter. Off heat, add
chocolate and let stand 1 minute; whisk until smooth. Pour into a
large bowl, and let stand 5 minutes, until tepid. Whisk in sugars and
corn syrup. Whisk in eggs, then vanilla.  Using a wooden spoon, stir
in flour mixture, just until blended.  Using a rubber spatula,
carefully fold in raspberries.

3. Spread batter evenly into prepared pan and bake 25 to 30 minutes,

Invert onto the wire cake rack, carefully peel off aluminum foil, and
cool completely.

4. White Chocolate Raspberry Topping:  In the top part of a double
boiler, over hot, not simmering, water, melt butter. (Water should be

4  squares unsweetened chocolate; melted, cooled
2 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder; preferably dutch processe
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk chocolate chips
1 cup chopped walnuts
12  marshmallows

Put rack in center of oven and heat to 350~. Generously grease 9x13
inch pan.  Coat with flour, tapping out the excess. Use mixer to
cream sugar and butter until fluffy. Add eggs and mix until thick and
lemon colored, about 2 minutes. Mix in chocolate and vanilla. Add
cocoa, flour and salt. Slowly mix in batter until combined. Stir in
chips and walnuts. Lay marshmallows sideways in prepared pan,
allowing 1 1/2 inch border around the inside edge of the pan and
spacing them evenly. Spoon batter (it's very thick) over marshmallows
to hide them as much as possible. Evenly fill in center of pan with
remaining batter, not adding batter to space between marshmallows and
sides of pan (batter will spread during baking and reach sides). Bake
until toothpick inserted into center comes out moist from melted
chocolate (not batter), 25 to 35 minutes. Let cool completely on
rack. Cut into 12 squares. Refrigerate until chilled. Use wide metal
spatula to carefully transfer brownies to serving platter. Wrap
airtight. Can be made a day in advance and refrigerated or frozen up
to 3 months. Serve chilled or at room temperature. 1:59 PM
