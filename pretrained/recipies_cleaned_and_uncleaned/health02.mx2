                           Deep Dish Tamale Pie

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Low Fat                         Main Dish
                Poultry                         Turkey


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === FILLING ===
  1              pound  lean ground turkey
     1/2           cup  chopped onion
  1                cup  chopped green pepper
     1/2           cup  tomato paste
     1/2      teaspoon  chili powder
  1         tablespoon  cumin
  1         tablespoon  garlic powder
  1           teaspoon  onion salt
  3             medium  tomatoes -- chopped
  1 1/2           cups  whole kernel corn
                        === CRUST ===
     1/2           cup  flour
     1/2           cup  cornmeal
  2        tablespoons  sugar
  1 1/2      teaspoons  baking powder
  1         tablespoon  margarine -- melted
     1/2           cup  skim milk
  1                     egg white
                        === TOPPING ===
     1/4           cup  shredded Cheddar cheese

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Brown ground turkey with seasonings, onion, green pepper and tomato paste.  Pour into baking dish.  Top with chopped tomatoes and corn. 
In a bowl, mix dry ingredients of crust together.  In a separate bowl, mix melted margarine, milk and egg white.  Pour liquid ingredients over cornmeal mixture and stir only until moistened (it will be lumpy).  Drop in spoonfuls over turkey mixture.  Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.  Bake for about 20 minutes or until "crust" is done. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Instead of a pie crust, hamburger and a fat-laden topping, a cornmeal muffin-like crust and ground turkey are substituted.  This makes this recipe significantly healthier.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2         pound  dried white beans -- rinsed
                        (such as Navy or Great Northern)
  1                     bay leaf
  1           teaspoon  salt
  4             medium  garlic cloves -- minced
  3         tablespoon  fresh lemon juice
  2         tablespoon  olive oil
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground white pepper
  1         tablespoon  finely-chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

In a large bowl, cover beans with 1 quart water.  Let soak for at least 6 hours or overnight.  Drain and rinse the beans and transfer to a large saucepan.  Add 6 cups water and the bay leaf and bring to a boil.  Lower the heat, cover and simmer gently for 1 hour.  Stir in 1 teaspoon of salt and simmer, covered, about 30 minutes longer, or until the beans are tender.  Drain and discard the bay leaf. 
In a food processor or blender, puree the beans until smooth.  Add the garlic, lemon juice, olive oil and white pepper and puree until blended.  Season with salt to taste and transfer to a serving bowl. 
Sprinkle the parsley over the puree and serve cold or at room temperature.  The puree can be refrigerated, covered, for up to one day. 
This recipe yields about 40 servings. 
Comments:  Looking for a fresh new taste to liven up your table?  Try this great low-fat Middle Eastern dip with carrot sticks, green, red and yellow bell pepper strips, radishes, green beans or toasted pita chips.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2        tablespoons  extra-virgin olive oil
  8             slices  peeled eggplant - (1/4" thick)
  2               cans  low-sodium tuna in water - (6 1/2 oz ea)
  1                cup  frozen cut green beans -- thawed
  2        tablespoons  red-wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  chopped fresh parsley
  2          teaspoons  chopped rinsed capers
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  12            slices  light or regular Italian bread
     1/2                red onion -- thinly sliced
  8               thin  tomato slices
     1/4           cup  black olives -- coarsely chopped
  12                    arugula leaves
  24                    watercress sprigs

Lightly brush a nonstick baking sheet with 1 tablespoon of the oil.  Arrange the eggplant on the sheet in a single layer.  Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes, or until the slices are lightly browned on the bottom.  Turn the pieces and bake for 10 minutes, or until tender.  Set aside. 
Drain the tuna well.  Transfer to a large bowl and flake with a fork.  Add the beans, vinegar, parsley, capers, pepper and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil.  Mix well.  Divide the tuna mixture among 4 slices of the bread.  Top with the onion slices.  Add another slice of bread to each sandwich.  Top with the eggplant and the tomato slices.  Sprinkle with the olives.  Top with the arugula, watercress and the remaining bread.  Cut each sandwich in half; secure the pieces with wooden picks. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  You can now enjoy this famous sandwich from the Mediterranean region due to massive cuts in fat and calories, but not flavor.

     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1         tablespoon  lemon juice
  4        tablespoons  freshly-grated Parmesan cheese
  4        tablespoons  parsley -- (optional)

Melt margarine in a skillet.  Sauté garlic.  Stir in flour and cook for a few minutes.  Add milk.  Stir and cook for about 5 minutes or until mixture thickens.  Add lemon juice. 
Fill large pot 2/3 full of water.  Bring to boil.  Add pasta and cook uncovered until pasta is tender, but firm to bite.  Drain pasta and divide between 4 plates.  Top with sauce and parmesan cheese. 
Note:  For 4 servings, 2 cups of thinly-sliced mushrooms may be added at the same time as the garlic.  Alternatively, 2 cups of steamed broccoli or asparagus may also top the pasta.  Two tablespoons of sherry in place of lemon juice adds a nice flavor.  Each adds negligible calories per serving.

                Fish And Vegetables In Spicy Orange Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Low Fat                         Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4               cups  cooked rice
  4                     orange roughy, haddock, cod or
                        red snapper fillets - (4 oz ea)
  1              small  sweet red pepper -- cut into rings
  1              small  green pepper -- cut into rings
     1/3           cup  orange juice
     1/4           cup  chopped drained mandarin orange sections
  4              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  honey mustard
  1           teaspoon  honey or packed brown sugar
  1           teaspoon  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  grated orange rind
     1/4      teaspoon  ground red pepper -- (optional)
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Lay four 12- by 18-inch pieces of aluminum foil or parchment paper on the work surface and lightly coat with nonstick spray.  Place 1 cup of the rice in the center of each piece of foil or paper; spread evenly into a thin rectangle about the size of a fish fillet.  Top with the fillets and then with alternating rings of red and green peppers. 
In a small bowl, combine the orange juice, orange sections, garlic, mustard, honey or brown sugar, oil, orange rind, ground red pepper (if using) and black pepper.  Spoon over the fish.  Fold the long sides of the foil or paper together, making several folds to encase the food snugly.  Fold the ends closed, like a package, to enclose securely. 
Lay the packets, seam-side up, on a baking sheet.  Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the fish is opaque and flakes when tested with a fork.  Be careful of escaping steam when opening the packets. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Most any mild, white, firm-fleshed fish will work in this speedy entree.  As with other en papillote dishes, parchment is traditional, but foil works fine.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2 1/2           cups  uncooked basmati rice
  1         tablespoon  olive oil

     1/2      teaspoon  cumin seed
     1/4           cup  slivered almonds

Grate the peel from 1/2 an orange.  Add to the simmering rice.  Peel the ginger root, cut 5 slices, chop and stir them into the rice.  Add the raisins and dried chopped apricots.  Sprinkle the rice mixture with cumin.  Cover and cook for a total of 30 minutes. 
Just before serving, toast the almonds in a heavy sauté pan until fragrant and light brown.  Top each serving of rice with toasted almonds.

                              Garlic Scampi

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Low Fat                         Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  3        tablespoons  chicken broth -- defatted
  2        tablespoons  white wine, dry sherry or
                        nonalcoholic white wine
  1 1/2    tablespoons  olive oil
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/4      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  3                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2         pounds  jumbo shrimp -- peeled, deveined
  2                     lemons -- cut into wedges

In a large shallow dish, stir together the broth, wine or sherry, olive oil, salt, oregano, pepper and garlic.  Add the shrimp and turn them to coat them well.  Cover with plastic wrap.  Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  (Do not marinate for longer than 2 hours or shrimp will become tough.) 
Preheat the broiler.  Remove the shrimp from the dish, reserving the marinade.  Thread the shrimp onto skewers, leaving a small space between each. 
Brush the shrimp with the reserved marinade.  Broil 4 inches from the heat for 2 minutes.  Turn the shrimp over, brush with the marinade and broil for 1 to 3 minutes more or until the shrimp are no longer pink. 
These shrimp also are delicious grilled.  Grill them directly over medium-hot coals for about 5 minutes, or until they are no longer pink. 
Serve with the lemon wedges. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  In Italian, "scampi" means large shrimp.  In this recipe, marinate them in a wine and garlic mixture to give them robust flavor, instead of sauteing them in a large amount of garlic-flavored oil.  Although it is basically a main course, you can serve the shrimp as an elegant party appetizer.

Categories    : Low Fat                         Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              large  onion -- thinly sliced
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  1              pound  red snapper fillets
  1         tablespoon  coarse mustard
  2               cups  chopped orange sections
  1                cup  chopped papayas
     1/3           cup  lime juice
  2        tablespoons  honey

In a large nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat, sauté the onion in the oil until soft and light brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.  Set aside. 
While the onions are cooking, rub the snapper on both sides with the mustard.  Grill or broil about 5 1/2 inches from the heat until cooked through, about 4 1/2 minutes on each side.  Transfer to a heated serving platter.  Top with the onions, oranges and papayas.  Keep warm. 
Add the lime juice and honey to the frying pan.  Bring to a boil over high heat and cook, stirring frequently, until reduced by half, about 3 minutes.  Drizzle over the fish. 
This recipe yields 4 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                can  salmon - (16 oz)
     1/2           cup  crushed soda crackers
  2                     egg whites
  1         tablespoon  skim milk
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/4           cup  chopped green pepper
     1/4      teaspoon  dill
  4        tablespoons  fat-free mayonnaise

Start grill/light coals.  Adjust the grate to be about 4 to 6 inches above the coals.  Spray the top of a broiler pan generously with non-stick spray. 
In a large bowl, combine all ingredients except salmon, dill and mayonnaise.  Mix in the salmon; shape into 4 balls and flatten.  Place patties on the broiler pan.  When the grill is ready/coals are white, place the broiler pan on the grate.  Grill the patties until they are crisp and slightly browned.  Remove to warmed plates.  Top with mayonnaise and sprinkle with dill.  (Note: Instead of mayonnaise, you may also serve with a chunky vegetable salsa -- will not significantly change nutritional values.) 
This recipe yields 4 patties.

                             Hawaiian Chicken

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Low Fat
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === CHICKEN ===
  4                     boneless skinless chicken breast halves -- (4 oz ea)
     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
                        === SAUCE ===
  1                can  pineapple slices packed in juice - (20 oz)
     3/4           cup  sugar
     1/2           cup  cider vinegar
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  1         tablespoon  reduced-sodium soy sauce
  1           teaspoon  grated ginger root
  1           teaspoon  chicken bouillon granules
  1              large  green pepper -- cut 1/4" thick rings
                        Hot cooked brown rice -- (optional)

To make the chicken:  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Spray a large skillet with no-stick spray; heat. 
Meanwhile, coat both sides of the chicken with the flour.  Shake off any excess flour.  Add the chicken to the hot skillet and brown on both sides.  Transfer the chicken to an 8- by 8- by 2-inch baking dish; set aside. 
To make the sauce:  Drain the pineapple, reserving the juice.  Transfer the juice to a 2-cup measuring cup.  Add enough water to make 1 1/4 cups.  In a medium saucepan, use a wire whisk to stir together the juice mixture, sugar, vinegar, cornstarch, soy sauce, ginger and bouillon granules.  Bring to a boil over medium heat.  Slightly reduce the heat and gently boil for 4 minutes, stirring often. 
Pour half of the sauce mixture over the chicken.  Arrange the pineapple slices and pepper rings on top.  Then pour on the remaining sauce mixture.  Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until the chicken is tender and no longer pink.  If desired, serve with the rice. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Here's a recipe for classic sweet-and-sour chicken that's healthier (and less messy!) than usual.  Instead of dipping the chicken into a thin batter and deep-frying it, dust the chicken with flour, pan-fry until golden and then finish it off in the oven.

                    Healthy Homestyle Country Sausage

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Low Fat                         Sausage


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1              pound  ground turkey breast -- see * Note
  1             medium  apple -- peeled, cored,
                        and finely shredded
     1/2           cup  cooked brown rice
  2        tablespoons  shredded onions
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1 1/2       teaspoon  ground sage
  1           teaspoon  salt
     1/2      teaspoon  ground red pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/4      teaspoon  ground allspice
                        Snipped fresh parsley -- (optional)

* Note:  To make sure you're buying the leanest ground turkey available, check the label.  Look for products made with only turkey breast meat.  Many ground turkey products contain the dark meat and the fatty skin. 
In a large bowl, stir together the turkey, apples, rice, onions and garlic.  In a small bowl, stir together the sage, salt, red and black peppers, thyme and allspice.  Sprinkle the spice mixture over the turkey mixture.  Using your hands, mix until well blended. 
Shape the turkey mixture into eight 1/2-inch thick patties.  Spray an unheated large skillet with no-stick spray.  Add the patties and cook over medium heat for 4 minutes.  Turn the patties over and cook about 4 minutes more or until they are no longer pink.  Sprinkle with the parsley, if desired. 
This recipe yields 8 patties; 4 servings. 
Comments:  This breakfast sausage is almost fat-free and tastes so much like its fatty counterpart that the taste testers kept asking how it was done.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1 1/3           cups  bow tie pasta or 1 cup macaroni
  1                cup  chopped celery
     1/3           cup  chopped onions
  1                can  99%-fat-free condensed cream of mushroom
                        soup with 1/3 less salt - (10 3/4 oz)
     3/4           cup  evaporated skim milk - (10 3/4 oz)
  1                can  water-packed tuna - (9 1/4 oz) -- drained
     1/4           cup  drained and chopped pimientos
  2        tablespoons  grated reduced-fat Parmesan cheese
                        Snipped fresh parsley

Cook the pasta according to the directions on the package.  Drain and set aside.  Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 
Lightly spray an unheated medium saucepan with no-stick spray.  Add the celery and onions.  Cook and stir over medium heat until tender.  Stir in the condensed soup and milk.  Then gently stir in the pasta, tuna and pimiento. 
Transfer the mixture to a 1 1/2-quart casserole.  Sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until heated through.  Sprinkle with the parsley to garnish. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Remember Mom's tuna casserole?  This version is just as satisfying, but it's made with today's health-conscious moms in mind.

                 Hot Crab Cakes With Yogurt Tartar Sauce

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Low Fat                         Main Dish
                Seafood

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        === SAUCE ===
     1/2           cup  nonfat plain yogurt
  1         tablespoon  reduced-calorie mayonnaise
  1         tablespoon  minced fresh dill
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  1           teaspoon  fresh lime juice
                        === CRAB CAKES ===
     1/4           cup  fat-free egg substitute
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  nonfat plain yogurt
  2          teaspoons  reduced-sodium soy sauce
     1/4      teaspoon  hot-pepper sauce
  8             ounces  cooked crabmeat -- cartilage removed
     1/3           cup  finely-chopped celery
     1/4           cup  finely-chopped green onions
  1           teaspoon  canola oil

Chef's Note:  Always pick over crabmeat to remove any little bits of shell and pieces of cartilage that might be in with the meat.  Then flake the meat with your fingers to break up large pieces.  For purposes of this recipe, you don't need to buy the most expensive crab.  The meat labeled claw meat, special or backfin is cheaper than jumbo lump backfin.  If your budget is tight, opt for artificial crab, also known as surimi. 
To make the sauce:  In a small bowl, stir together the yogurt, mayonnaise, dill, garlic and lime juice.  Set the sauce aside. 
To make the crab cakes:  In a medium bowl, stir together the egg substitute, mustard, yogurt, soy sauce and pepper sauce.  Add the crab, celery and onions.  Mix until combined.  Form the crab mixture into 16 patties. 
Add 1/2 teaspoon of the oil to a large nonstick skillet and heat over medium heat.  Add half the crab patties.  Cook for 4 minutes.  Turn the patties over and cook about 4 minutes more or until golden. 
Cook the remaining patties using the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of oil.  Serve the crab cakes with the sauce. 
This recipe yields 16 crab cakes; serving size 4. 
Comments:  Crab cakes can be fairly high in fat, especially when they're deep-fried.  But these mini patties are prepared with low-fat ingredients and just lightly sauteed in a touch of oil.

                             Jamaican Chicken

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Low Fat
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2           cup  water
  5        thin slices  fresh ginger - (to 6 slices)
  2                     dried chili peppers -- crumbled
     1/2                onion -- chopped
     1/4           cup  white wine vinegar
  1         tablespoon  pepper sauce -- see * Note
  1           teaspoon  dried thyme
     1/2      teaspoon  ground allspice
     1/2      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  1 1/4         pounds  boneless skinless chicken breasts -- cubed

* Note:  For authentic Jamaican flavor, choose a pepper sauce that contains tamarind and hot peppers, such as Pickapeppa.  It is sold in large supermarkets and specialty stores.  You may replace it with Worcestershire sauce and a splash of hot-pepper sauce. 
In a blender, combine the water, ginger, chili peppers, onions, vinegar, pepper sauce, thyme, allspice and black pepper.  Puree until fairly smooth.  Pour the marinade into a large bowl.  Add the chicken and stir to coat well.  Cover and refrigerate for 4 to 5 hours, stirring occasionally. 
Thread the meat onto metal skewers.  Reserve the marinade, transfer to a saucepan and bring to a full boil.  Keep warm over low heat.  Grill or broil the chicken, until cooked through, about 5 minutes per side.  Serve the boiled marinade as a sauce. 
Accompaniments:  Serve with black beans, yellow rice and corn bread.  For a real tropical flair, garnish with pineapple, mango or papaya slices. 
Variation:  You may replace the chicken with cubes or strips of turkey breast, pork tenderloin or flank steak, or use bone-in chicken pieces.  Adjust the cooking time accordingly. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  This hot traditional Jamaican dish will suit the palate, scales and waistline of spice lovers.

                        === MARINADE ===
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh coriander
     1/4           cup  chopped fresh mint
  1                     green chili pepper -- seeded, chopped
  3                     garlic cloves -- sliced
  2        tablespoons  grated fresh ginger
     1/2           cup  nonfat yogurt
  1           teaspoon  ground cumin
  1           teaspoon  ground coriander
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cinnamon
  1              pinch  ground cloves
  12            ounces  lean lamb from leg -- cut into 1" cubes
                        === KABOBS ===
  1              large  onion
  1                     sweet red pepper -- cut into 1" cubes
  1                     yellow pepper -- cut into 1" cubes
  1                     zucchini -- cut into 1" cubes
  1                     yellow squash -- cut into 1" cubes
                        === COUSCOUS ===
  2               cups  defatted stock
  2               cups  couscous

To make the marinade:  In a food processor grind together the fresh coriander, mint, chili pepper, garlic and ginger (or finely chop by hand).  Place in a mixing bowl with the yogurt, cumin, ground coriander, cinnamon and cloves.  Add the lamb and mix well.  Allow to marinate for at least 2 to 3 hours in the refrigerator. 
To make the kabobs:  Peel the onion and trim off the root hairs, leaving the root stem attached.  Cut into 1-inch wedges, leaving the root on each section so wedges don't separate.  Add the onions, red peppers, yellow peppers, zucchini and squash to marinade mixture.  Mix to coat well. 
Preheat the broiler or light a charcoal or gas grill, allowing it to get very hot.  Thread meat and vegetables onto metal or bamboo skewers.  Grill over high heat for 15 to 20 minutes, turning skewers to cook all sides, until meat is cooked as desired. 
To make the couscous:  While the lamb is cooking, bring the stock to a boil in a 1-quart saucepan.  Add the couscous.  Cover the pan and remove it from the heat.  Let stand for 3 to 4 minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed.  Fluff with fork.  Serve hot with the lamb. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Variations:  You may substitute small mushrooms, cherry tomatoes or cubes of eggplant for any of the other vegetables.  You may also substitute cubes of lean beef for the lamb.  Try cooked bulgur or rice in place of the couscous. 
Make-Ahead tip:  Prepare the yogurt marinade early in the day or even the night before.  Add the lamb and refrigerate until ready to cook. 
Comments:  Lamb kabobs, marinated in yogurt and a multitude of spices is sure to be a hit at the dinner table.  The fresh taste of this dish is enhanced by the use of fresh herbs and vegetables.

Categories    : Chicken                         Low Fat
                Main Dish                       Poultry


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  4                     skinless bone-in chicken breast halves -- (6 oz ea)
     1/8      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper
  2        tablespoons  lemon juice
  1                cup  reduced-fat lemon yogurt
  2          teaspoons  all-purpose flour
  1                     garlic clove -- minced
     1/2      teaspoon  ground ginger
     1/4      teaspoon  finely-shredded lemon rind

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Sprinkle the chicken with the salt and pepper.  Place in a 13- by 9-inch baking pan.  Sprinkle with the lemon juice.  Cover and bake for 40 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and the juices run clear when you pierce the thickest park of the breast with a fork.  Remove the chicken from the dish; discard the juices. 
In a small bowl, stir together the yogurt, flour, garlic, ginger and lemon rind.  Return the chicken to the baking pan.  Spread the yogurt mixture over the chicken.  Cover and bake for 10 minutes.  Serve over spinach fettuccine if you wish. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Lemon yogurt adds body and a touch of sweetness to the creamy sauce.  This recipe uses bone-in chicken breasts.  If desired, you could substitute boneless breasts and reduce the initial baking time by about 20 minutes.

Categories    : Low Fat                         Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  8             ounces  linguine
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  6              large  garlic cloves -- minced
  3               cans  whole baby clams - (10 oz ea) -- with juices
     1/3           cup  dry white wine or nonalcoholic white wine
     1/3           cup  chicken broth -- defatted
  1              large  carrot -- shredded
     1/2      teaspoon  dried oregano
     1/2           cup  snipped fresh Italian parsley -- (loosely packed)
     1/2      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  freshly-ground black pepper

Cook the pasta according to the directions on the package.  Drain and set aside.  If necessary, cover to keep warm. 
Meanwhile, lightly spray an unheated large skillet with no-stick spray.  Add the olive oil and heat over medium heat.  Add the garlic.  Cook and stir for 1 minute. 
Drain the clams, reserving the juices.  Set the clams aside.  Add the juices, wine, broth, carrots and oregano to the skillet.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Boil about 15 minutes or until the mixture reduces to about 1 1/3 cups. 
Stir in the clams and all but 1 tablespoon of the parsley.  Simmer about 1 minute or just until heated through.  Then stir in the salt and pepper. 
To serve, transfer the hot pasta to a large bowl.  Pour the clam sauce over the pasta and gently toss until well combined.  Sprinkle with the remaining 1 tablespoon parsley to garnish. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Comments:  Just keep a few cans of clams on hand in your cupboard and you'll have what it takes to prepare a healthful, savory main dish on a moment's notice.

                            Loose Beef Fajitas

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Low Fat
                Main Dish

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  ground sirloin beef
  1                cup  chopped onions
     1/2           cup  chopped green peppers
     1/2           cup  chopped sweet red peppers
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2          teaspoons  chili powder
     1/2      teaspoon  ground cumin
  1                cup  chunky salsa
     1/2           cup  chopped tomatoes
  8                     corn or flour tortillas -- warmed

In a large nonstick skillet, cook the beef, onions, green and red peppers and garlic over medium heat about 5 minutes or until the beef is browned and the vegetables are tender, stirring frequently.  Stir in the chili powder and cumin and cook for 1 minute.  Add the salsa and tomatoes.  Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat.  Simmer, uncovered, for 4 to 5 minutes or until the liquid reduces slightly, stirring occasionally. 
To serve, spoon some of the beef mixture just below the center on each of the tortillas.  Fold the bottom edge of each tortilla over the filling, then fold in the sides and roll up to enclose the filling. 
This recipe yields 4 servings. 
Slimming strategy:  For an easy, low-fat Mexican topping, stir a small amount of chili powder or cumin, or chopped cucumbers, green onions or your favorite fresh vegetable, into nonfat sour cream or plain yogurt.  Or top your entree with salsa; 2 tablespoons of a low-fat brand contains only about 8 calories and no fat. 
Comments:  Not only is this recipe fast and tasty, it is lower in fat and calories than the traditional fajita recipes.

                         Low Sodium Chicken Broth

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 8     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Chicken                         Low Fat
                Poultry                         Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  1                     chicken carcass
  1                     onion -- quartered
  1                     carrot -- cut 1" chunks
  1                     leek white only -- cut 1" chunks
  1                     celery rib including leaves -- cut 1" chunks
  3             quarts  cold water
  2             sprigs  fresh thyme
                        (or 1/2 tspn dried thyme)
  1                     bay leaf
  2                     pepper corns
  1              sprig  fresh rosemary
                        (or 1/2 tspn dried rosemary)
  1                     garlic clove
  1           teaspoon  tumeric
     1/2      teaspoon  poultry seasoning

Place chicken, onion, carrots, leeks and celery into stock pot.  Cover with cold water.  Bring to boil.  Skim off any fat and foam.  Reduce heat to simmer.  Add remaining herbs and seasonings.  Simmer uncovered for 3 or more hours; add hot water to keep 2 quarts of stock and vegetables covered. 
Remove from heat.  Degrease by skimming off fat with a spoon or paper towels.  Strain into pan.  Place pan into ice bath to cool further.  Store in covered containers.  Can freeze up to three months. 
This recipe yields 2 quarts for eight 1 cup servings. 
Comments:  This recipe saves calories by not "browning" the chicken bones in oil.  If a "browner" stock is desired you can first sauté the bones and vegetables by placing them into the stock pot coated with non-stick spray.  Smaller quantities of broth may be frozen first in ice cube trays and then transferred into zip-top plastic bags for later use.

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 6     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Low Fat                         Main Dish
                Pork

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2        tablespoons  chopped fresh parsley
  1         tablespoon  Dijon mustard
  1         tablespoon  water
  2          teaspoons  dried thyme
  2          teaspoons  dried basil
  2          teaspoons  sugar
  1           teaspoon  vinegar
     1/4      teaspoon  salt
     1/8      teaspoon  ground red pepper
  2             pounds  boneless pork top loin roast -- trimmed of
                        all visible fat

In a small bowl, stir together the garlic, parsley, mustard, water, thyme, basil, sugar, vinegar, salt and pepper.  Place the pork in a pie plate.  Spread evenly with the garlic mixture.  Cover and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours. 
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Coat a roasting rack with nonstick spray and place the rack in a roasting pan.  Place the roast on the rack.  Roast for 1 hour, or until the meat thermometer inserted in the center registers 160 degrees. 
Transfer the pork to a cutting board; cover with foil and let stand for 15 minutes before slicing. 
This recipe yields 6 servings. 
Comments:  Don't be put off by the long cooking time for this delicious roast.  Because all the prep work is done the night or morning before, the roast takes care of itself at dinnertime, freeing you for other activities.  Even though we managed to trim substantial calories from this recipe, the percentage of calories from fat is still higher than the recommended thirty percent.

                         Old Fashioned Beef Stew

Recipe By     :n/a
Serving Size  : 4     Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Beef                            Low Fat
                Main Dish                       Soups/Stews


  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  12            ounces  boneless beef round roast -- cut bite size
     1/2           cup  chopped onions
  1                     green pepper -- chopped
  2                     garlic cloves -- minced
  2             medium  potatoes -- peeled, diced
  4             medium  carrots -- sliced
  1                can  beef broth - (14 oz) -- defatted
     1/4           cup  evaporated skim milk
  1           teaspoon  paprika
  2        tablespoons  cornstarch
  2        tablespoons  dry sherry or dry red wine
                        or nonalcoholic red wine

Spray an unheated large skillet with no-stick spray.  Heat the skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the beef, onions, green peppers and garlic.  Cook and stir until the beef is browned. 
Stir in the potatoes, carrots and broth.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat.  Cover and simmer about 30 minutes or until the meat is nearly tender.  (Do not boil.)  Stir in the milk and paprika. 
In a custard cup, stir together the cornstarch and sherry or wine until smooth.  Then stir the cornstarch mixture into the beef mixture.  Cook until slightly thickened and bubbly.  Cook and stir for 2 minutes more. 
This recipe yields 4 main-dish servings. 
Comments:  Just a few simple changes dramatically reduced the calories and fat in this classic stew.  You can easily adapt these techniques to your own favorite stew recipe.  Calories, fat and cholesterol were reduced by: * Reducing the amount of beef stew meat and replacing the remainder with a leaner cut of beef; * Using no-stick spray instead of oil to brown the beef; * Removing the fat from the beef broth; * Using evaporated skim milk instead of heavy cream.
