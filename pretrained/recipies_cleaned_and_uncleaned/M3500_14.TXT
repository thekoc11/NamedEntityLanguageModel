    1/4 oz Brandy

  Pour ingredients slowly, in order given, into a pony or pousse-cafe
  glass, being careful not to let ingredients mix. This produces a
  multi-colored "striped" effect of the liquors.For best results pour
  each ingredient slowly over a teaspoon held bottom-side up over the
  glass. You can achieve the same effect by inserting a glass stirring
  rod into the glass and then slowly pouring each ingredient down the
  rod.

    1/2 ts Yeast
 
  Dump all this crap together in a really big mason jar or some other
  jar that can be sealed and  stir it all up until it is all dissolved.
  Seal the sucker up nice and tight and stuff it in the closet behind
  the vacuum cleaner or your bill box.  Make sure the closet isn't too
  hot or too cold-- you know keep the stuff at room temperature. Now
  forget about it. Listen to BBBB six to eight times in a row (wait at
  least twenty four hours). Go to the closet open the sucker up, strain
  the shit through a pair of panty hose, then refrigerate the stuff
  until its really really cold. Drink it straight or use it in some of
  the recipes that follow. (like a dark and stormy) Gives you ‘bout 1/2

  I made up the name for this. Sometimes pool hustlers and other
  gamblers like to look as though they are drinking alcohol when they
  are actually remaining sober. One of the prime choices is half and
  half club soda and ginger ale. It looks like a Scotch and soda, and a
  well-tipped waitress will bring you this harmless concoction in the
  same glass as is used to serve a Scotch and soda whenever you order a
  Scotch and soda, and no one is the wiser.

  Comments: Despite the unorthodox ingredients, this is really about
  the best imitation Irish cream liqueur I've ever tried - superior to
  some of the Bailey's knock-offs on the market, even.  I recommend
  using the best Irish whiskey you can afford in this recipe, such as
  Jamieson's.

      Title: Old-Fashioned Ginger Beer
 Categories: Alcohol, Beverages, Mixed drink
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           For The Starter-----
    1/2 oz Yeast
      2 ts Sugar
           To Feed The "Plant"-----
      7 ts Ground Ginger
      7 ts Sugar
           To Flavour-----
  1 1/2 lb Sugar
           Juice Of 2 Lemons
 
  Mix starter ingredients with 3/4 pint of warm water in a glass jar.
  Stir, cover and leave in a warm place for 24 hours. This is your
  starter "plant".
  
  Feed the "plant" with 1 teaspoon each of ground ginger and sugar each
  day.
  
  After 7 days strain through a fine sieve.  Dissolve the sugar in 2
  pints of water.  Add the lemon juice and the liquid from the "plant".
  Dilute with 5 pints of water, mix well and store in corked bottles
  for at least 7 days.
  
  Use strong bottles as pressure may build up which will cause thin
  bottles to explode.  For the same reason use corked bottles rather
  than those with a more secure closure that will not 'give' under
  pressure.
  
  Ross requested a recipe for ginger beer.  This is a recipe that I have
  often used and it produces a really old-fashioned drink.  It is quite
  a long process but well worth the effort.  The amount of sugar in the
  final stage can be varied according to taste.  Please excuse the use
  of Imperial measures - I am only a poor ignorant pom.

  glass canning jar or any other that has an enamel-lined lid. Pour in
  enough brandy to cover the berries. Addequal portions of the
  remaining berries and brandy to reach the top of the jar's lip; make
  sure that all the berries are covered by the brandy. Pour in just
  enough brandy to begin a small overflow, then thightly cap the jar
  and wipe the outside clean. Allow to steep in a cool, dark place for
  2 months. Or, tape a piece of black construction paper around the
  jar. Every 2 weeks, gently shake the jar to distribute the flavors.
  
  After 2 months, gently pour the jar's contents through a regular
  strainer or sieve; discard the residue. Follow this by 2 strainings
  through slightly dampened cheesecloth or through a large clean coffee
  filter placed inside a funnel; loosely cover the contents with
  plastic wrap, since the process may take several hours.
  
  In a small pan, combine the sugar, water, and lemon zest. Bring to a
  boil over moderate-high heat. Simmer, uncovered for 5 minutes. Let
  cool to room temperature. Add the optionalglycerine, if desired.
  
  Funnel into a glass bottle, then funnel in the sugar syrup through a
  strainer, to remove the zest.
  
  Cover tightly; shake to blend. Let mature at room temperature, or
  slightly cooler, for at least 1 month.  Can use vodka instead of
  brandy. From "Glorious Liqueurs," Mary Morris.

           Wine
           Fruit punch
           Soda water
           Ice
 
  Buy some white wine that you like.  I like Italian Sparkling wines,
  they are sweet and are already carbonated so you can make a stronger
  cooler by cutting back on the water. Find two or three fruits you
  like and squeeze out the juice. Add this juice to the wine and stir
  it up. Pour in to cooler or suitable container already full of ice.
  pour in the carbonated water and stir slowly.  Garnish with chunks of
  fruit. Keep a lid on it to keep out the flies and keep in the
  carbonation. BTW a real sangaree combines wine, brandy and water.
  Try substituting a schnapps or brandy for the juice for a cooler with
  more kick. Pretty basic stuff but its classier than Bartles and
  Jaymes and you can make your own flavors like strawberry banana,
  watermelon lime and so on.

    1/4 lb Salt pork
      1 ea Bottom or top round of beef*
           Salt
           Pepper
    1/2 c  Water
      1 cn Tomatoes (16 oz)
      4 ea Potatoes,medium-sized**

      6 ea Carrots,medium-sized***
 
  * - 4 to 5 lb. ** - peeled and cut into large cubes. *** - scraped
  and cut into 1" thick slices.
  
  1. Rinse salt pork to remove excess salt, blot dry, and cut into small
  dice. Place in a heavy stew pot over low heat until all fat has been
  rendered. Remove and discard pork dice (or save to add to green salad
  ~ it's great).
  
  2. Heat the rendered fat to almost smoking, add the beef, and brown
  it on all sides, turning it with a spatula and wooden spoon. (Do not
  pierce with fork or juices will run out and meat will become dry and
  stringy.)
  
  3. When meat is well browned, remove it from the pot and set aside.
  Pour off all cooking fat and discard. Return meat to pot, sprinkle
  generously with salt and pepper, and add water. Cover tightly and let
  cook over low heat for 2 hours. Add tomatoes, cover again, and
  continue to cook until meat is almost tender, about 30 minutes.
  Arrange potato cubes, onions, and carrots around meat. Cover and cook
  a final half hour, or until vegetables and meat are tender.

 Categories: Cake/cookie
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3 tb Butter flavored Crisco
      3 tb Dutch process cocoa
      1 tb Honey
    1/4 ts Vanilla
    1/4 ts Almond extract
      1 c  Powdered sugar
      1 tb Non dairy liquid creamer
 
  In a small bowl cream Crisco, cocoa, honey and flavorings. Add
  powdered sugar and creamer. Beat to spreading consistency, adding
  additional creamer if needed.  Makes frosting for one 9x13 cake or 20
  - 24 cupcakes.
  
  Notes: I created this for my mother who is lactose intolerant because
  she dearly loves chocolate frosting.  You could use water as the
  liquid in this, however the creamer makes a richer tasting frosting.

 Categories: Desserts, Cajun/creol, Pastry
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3    Bananas, up to ...
      4    Bananas (slightly under-
           Ripe), cut in 1" thick
           Slices
    1/2    Lemon, juice of
           -sugar
    1/4 c  White rum

MMMMM---------------------------BATTER--------------------------------
      1 c  Sifted flour
      1 pn Salt
      2 ts Sugar
    1/3 c  Warm beer
           -a little water
      2 tb Melted sweet butter
           -vegetable oil for deep
           Frying
      2    Egg whites
 
  Place the banana slices in a bowl and sprinkle with lemon juice,
  sugar and rum.  Toss lightly.  Cover and marinate for 40 or 50
  minutes. Batter: In a bowl combine the flour, salt and sugar.  Add
  the beer and incorporate it into the flour.  Do not overbeat, just
  blend it in. Add just enough water to give the batter the consistency
  of heavy cream. Add the melted butter and let the batter stand for 40
  minutes to 1 hour. Heat the oil (to the depth of 3 inches) in a large
  skillet.  You do not need a deep fryer. While the oil is getting hot,
  beat the egg whites and add them to the batter. Drain the banana
  slices and dip them into the batter. Drop 4 to 6 at a time into the
  hot fat and fry them until they are nicely browned. Drain the
  beignets on paper towels and sprinkle with lots of confectioners'
  sugar. Serve immediately. Variation: apple slices can be substituted
  for bananas. From "Seasonal Kitchen" by Perla Meyers.

           Pepper to taste
 
  Variation of Bean Burger calling for Kidney Beans posted on Intercook
  by Sandee Eveland.  I didn't have all the right ingredients for that
  recipe so experimented with black beans instead.
  
  Mix all ingredients well.  Using 1/4 lb hamburger press, make four
  burgers.
  
  Can vary the taste with more/less spices.
  
  Preheat electric skillet to 350 degrees.  Spray with vegetable spay.
  Fry burgers about 15 minutes, turning once or twice until surface is
  golden brown and burger feels "set"
  
  The consistency of these burgers "May" allow them to be grilled on
  bbq if using a gas grill over low heat.
  
  Will have son evaluate this experiment. These passed the taste test!

      Title: Melokhia (Egyptian herb soup)
 Categories: Middle east, Soup/stew
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  4 1/2 oz Dried melokhia leaves, or:
  4 1/4 lb Fresh melokhia leaves
  1 1/2 qt Strong stock
           Salt
           Black pepper, freshly ground
      1 oz Butter
      3    Garlic cloves, crushed
      1 tb Ground coriander
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
 
  Crush the dried Melokhia leaves. Put them in a bowl and moisten with a
  little hot water. Set aside until they swell and double in bulk. If
  the leaves are not brittle enough to crumble, dry them out in a warm
  oven for a few minutes. If fresh leaves are being used, wash them
  thoroughly and cut off the stalks. Spread the leaves out on a clean
  cloth to dry. Chop them finely.
  
  Put the stock in a large saucepan (you can use any stock, except
  pork). Season with salt and pepper and bring to the boil. Add the
  chopped or crumbled leaves and simmer for 10 minutes if the leaves
  are fresh and for 30 minutes if dry.
  
  Meanwhile, prepare the "Taklia" or garlic sauce. Melt the butter in a
  small frying-pan. Add the garlic and fry, stirring, until it is
  golden brown. Add the coriander and cayenne and cook, stirring, for 2
  minutes. Add the garlic mixture to the soup, cover the pan, and
  simmer for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust the seasoning and
  serve.
  
  "Melokhia is a soup made from an Egyptian herb similar to spinach. It
  is one of the national dishes of Egypt. Melokhia leaves are available
  dried from Greek shops, and occasionally the fresh leaves are
  available in some markets."
  
  If you can't get Melokhia, try this recipe with spinach. Works for me!

      Title: Poulet Roti Au Calvados (Roast Chicken)
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Whole Chickens
           Kosher Salt
           Pepper, Ground
      2    Onions, Chopped Coarse
  1 1/2 c  Unpeeled Apple Slices
      2 tb Sweet Butter, Melted
    1/4 c  Apple Juice
      2 tb Olive oil
      4 tb Calvados [apple brandy]
      2 lg Red apples
      2 ts Parsley, minced
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Remove the wing tips and reserve.
  Thoroughly clean the chickens, removing excess fat and any bloody bits
  inside the cavities. Wash and dry the birds thoroughly. Reserve the
  giblets. Salt and pepper the cavities lightly. Set aside half the
  chopped onions. Stuff the birds equally with the remaining onions and
  the apple slices. Truss the birds with kitchen string. Season with
  salt and pepper. Combine the butter, apple juice and half the
  Calvados in a small saucepan. Brush the birds with some of the butter
  mixture. Place the birds on a rack in a roasting pan. Roast 40
  minutes, basting after 20 minutes with more of the butter mixture and
  any pan juices which have accumulated in the roasting pan. Combine
  the set aside onions with the wingtips and the giblets in a small
  saucepan. Add water to cover. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Skim
  any scum which forms on the surface. Reduce heat to maintain the
  simmer. Simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour. Strain. Reserve. Quarter and
  core the large red apples. Slice each quarter in half lengthwise.
  Baste the chickens again after they have been roasting for 40
  minutes. Add the apple slices to the roasting pan. Continue roasting.
  Baste the birds and the apples after another 20 minutes. Check the
  birds for doneness after a total of 65 minutes roasting time (the
  juices should run clear when a skewer is poked into the meatiest part
  of the breast). Remove the birds from the oven when done. Baste the
  birds one last time with the butter mixture. Transfer the birds to a
  cutting board. Transfer the apple slices to a serving platter. Let
  the chickens rest while preparing the sauce. Pour off any fat from
  the roasting pan. Place the pan on top of the stove over moderate
  heat. Add the strained giblet stock. Stir to scrape up any browned
  bits stuck to the bottom. Add the remaining Calvados. Reduce the
  liquid to 2/3 cup over high heat (for 6 servings, adjust as
  required). Season to taste with salt and pepper. Un-truss the
  chicken(s). Discard the apple slices and onions from the cavities.
  Carve into serving pieces. Arrange on the platter over the roasted
  apple slices. Spoon sauce over. Garnish with minced parsley.

      2 c  Masa Harina
  1 1/2 c  Poultry Stock
      2 ts Baking Powder
      1 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Lard
  1 1/2 c  Sloppy Joe Filling
 
  Remove the outer husks from the corn. Set the corn aside for other
  use. Soak the husks in hot water for 5 minutes. Drain. Combine the
  Masa Harina, baking powder and salt. Cream the lard (use an electric
  mixer). Very gradually (1 or 2 tablespoons at a time) beat in the
  corn mixture once the lard is fluffy. Continue to beat constantly
  while slowly adding the stock until the dough is light enough to
  float in a glass of water. Lay out enough of the corn husk leaves
  (about 4" x 9" each) to make 24 tamales (overlap the leaves if they
  are too small). Use a spatula to spread 1 tablespoon of dough in a 3"
  x 4" rectangle on each leaf. Drop 1 tablespoon of sloppy joe filling
  into the center of each dough lined leaf. Wrap by overlapping the
  edges of the leaves lengthwise and folding up the ends. Layer the
  folded husks, seam sides down, in a flat bottomed steamer colander or
  on the tray of a tamale pot. Fill the steamer with water to about 1"
  below the tray or colander base. Bring the water to a rolling boil.
  Cover the pot tightly. Reduce heat and steam until the dough is firm
  enough to pull away easily from the leaves (60 to 90 minutes). Serve
  the tamales in the leaves on a well heated platter (the leaves will be
  discarded). Plan on 3 tamales per person.

 Categories: Italian, Breads, Pizza
      Yield: 2 14" pies
 
      4 c  All-Purpose Flour
      1    Cake Yeast
  1 1/3 c  Warm Water
      2 tb Olive Oil
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Parmesan, grated
           Cornmeal
 
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place the pizza baking stone(s) or
  tile(s) in the oven to be heated. Dissolve the yeast in the warm (85
  degrees F) water. Let stand without stirring until the mixture foams
  (8-10 minutes). Combine the flour and salt in a bowl. Add the olive
  oil and yeast mixture. Stir well. Add the grated Parmesan. Stir well.
  Cover the bowl with a cloth. Let the dough rest about 10 minutes.
  Turn out onto a well floured board and knead until smooth (about 10
  minutes). Place the dough in a greased bowl. Cover and let rise until
  doubled (about 2 hours). Punch down. Turn out onto a floured board.
  Divide the dough into equal portions. Roll each portion of the dough
  to a thickness of 1/4 ". Oil the (14") pizza pans. Sprinkle some
  cornmeal on each. Form the pies in the pans, pinching the edges up a
  little to hold the filling. Brush the dough liberally with olive oil.
  Spread the sauce(s), seasoning(s) and topping(s) over the dough
  leaving the outer 1/2" bare. Let the pies rest about 10 minutes.
  Remove the pies from the pans and, using a pizza peel, place on the
  baking stone(s). Bake until the edges are light brown and the cheese
  is bubbly. Serve.

      Title: Easy Beer Bread
 Categories: Breads, Alcohol
      Yield: 1 loaf
 
      2 c  Self-rising flour
      3 tb Sugar
      1 cn Beer (12 oz)
 
  Spray a 9"x5"x3" loaf pan with non-stick spray. Mix flour, sugar, and
  beer together to make a soft, sticky dough.  Pour dough into loaf pan
  and bake at 350 F for 1 hour.  Allow to cool in pan and it usually
  dumps out easily. This makes a quick & easy bread for those non-bread
  bakers out there. I've tried it and it makes a fairly dense chewy
  bread. Great with BBQs or accompaning a salad.  Good toasted too. The
  kind of beer can make a big difference in the taste of the bread, so
  experiment with some dark flavorful brews.
  
  A couple of variations: Salsa Bread - add an extra 1/2 cup flour and
  1/2 cup of your favorite salsa to the batter. Jalapeno Cheese - mince
  up 2 or 3 jalapenos and grate 1/2 cup of chedder cheese. Mix into
  batter and bake as above. Dill-chive bread - Add 1 Tbsp dry dillweed
  and 1 Tbsp chives to the batter.

      Title: Lemon Sorbet
 Categories: Desserts, Fruit
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Peel of 1 lemon, diced small
      1 c  Water
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Lemon juice
    1/2 c  Mineral water
           Lemon peel twists to garnish
 
  Make a syrup by combining the finely diced lemon peel with the water
  & the sugar in a non-corrosive pan.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat &
  simmer for 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat & let cool.  Combine the
  syrup with the lemon juice & the mineral water.
  
  At this point, use one of two steps.  Either use an ice cream maker &
  follow the maunfacturers instructions.  Or, place in a tall canister
  & put in the freezer.  Freeze for 1 1/2 hours.  Remove, stir & beat
  briefly with a whisk.  Return to the freezer & repeat the beating
  process after another 50 minutes.  You may have to repeat this three
  or four times. The more you beat your sorbet, the more air is being
  incorporated & hence the lighter the finished product.  Keep in the
  freezer above your fridge rather than a deep freeze otherwise you'll
  get a finished product that is hard. If you only have a deep freeze,
  place sorbet in fridge for 1 to 2 hours before serving.
  
  Will keep for 3 or 4 days.
  
  NOTE: The author from whom I adapted this recipe suggested that you
  do not use a deep freeze or any free standing when making sorbets
  because the temperatures are too cold.  However, I have had no
  success making a sorbet from scratch in a fridge-freezer.  I use my
  chest freezer & mix more often than is called for.  When the sorbet
  is ready, then I transfer it to the fridge freezer for keeping it.

MMMMM-----------------------SUDS AND GRUB----------------------------
 
  "A British beer aficianado gives pointers on which lager, ale or
  stout to sip with your favorite fare."
  
  "Matching beer with food is not an eccentric idea. We only think it's
  eccentric because it's something we've forgotten about."
  
  "Traditionally, beer was served with meals throughout Europe. If you
  look at old labels you see lots of `dinner ales'. If you read
  Dickens, his charcters were always having pots of ales with their
  dinners."
  
  This is Michael Jackson talking. No, not that Michael Jackson. This
  one can't moonwalk and he doesn't wear a glove. But he knows his
  beer. In fact, the hirsute, rumpled Englishman is the world's leading
  authority on suds. Just call him the Billy Graham of beer or, more
  accurately, The Guru Of Grain. In addition to his books on beer,
  Jackson also writes knowledgeably on whiskey. His latest book is
  `Michael Jackson's Beer Companion' (General, $39.95)
  
  "When you try to introduce the concept of choosing beers for specfic
  dishes people very often say, `I like the idea but the quantity is
  such a problem,' says Jackson. You don't need to drink a pint with
  every dish. There's no reason why can't drink beer out of a wine
  glass. It's actually very good out of a burgundy glass. You get a
  good look at the color, it contains the aroma very well and it's
  about the right serving portion. You can have one bottle and share it
  with your partner." Jackson suggests you think of beers the way you
  think of wines, and you'll begin to understand why there are over 40
  different types.
  
  "To many people, beer is a light-bodied, golden, sparkling, medium-dry
  drink ++ and that's only the beer they know."
  
  "A person who looks at beer like that is a person who thinks that the
  only wine that exists is California Chablis." Jackson explains that
  in Europe it's traditional to serve a particular beer with a
  particular food. A stout such as Guinness with oysters, for example,
  is a combination that goes back to the time when stout was the
  dominant style of beer in Britain and oysters were 10 a penny and put
  on the bar as a snack. Another example: In Alsace, Switzerland and
  parts of southern Germany they're very fond of having great feasts of
  asparagus, often accompanied by scrambled eggs and ham. With this
  meal, says Jackson, they drink a standard lager.
  
  "But a Belgian monk gave me the perfect match ++ a Belgian Trappest
  Triple. Its coriander-like flavor goes very well with asparagus. It's
  harder to find a wine that goes with asparagus. When matching beer
  with food, Jackson suggests you think wine. What wine would best go
  with the dish and what beer is the best correlative to that wine?
  Here are his suggestions.
  
  NEW WORLD CHARDONNAY: A malty, hoppy beer like Samuel Adams Boston
  Ale.
  
  BURGUNDY-STYLE CHARDONNAY: A classic European Pilsner that has the
  harder, drier, bitter hop characteristics of a Chablis.
  
  CLARET (RED BORDEAUX): English pale ale NEW WORLD CANERNET SAUVIGNON:
  Pale ales from Washington and Oregon.
  
  PINOT NOIR/BURGUNDY: The richer, heavier Scottish or Belgian ales.
  
  SAUTERNES (DESSERT WINE): Some of the very strong barley wines or
  some of the spicy, strong Belgian beers.
  
  OLOROSO SHERRY: Thomas Hardy ale.
  
  MATCHING FOOD AND BEER:  [some pointers from Michael Jackson]
  
  BARBECUES: Dryish porter or stout.
  
  CHEESE: Strong, hoppy Belgian beer or barley wine.
  
  CHICKEN & PORK: Festbier or Dortmunder
  
  DESSERTS: Double bock, Trappist ale or barley wine.
  
  FISH (COOKED): Pilsner
  
  FISH (RAW, PICKLED OR SMOKED): Very acidic beers such as Belgian
  lambics or red ales.
  
  LAMB, BEEF AND GAME: Pale ale.
  
  PATES AND TERRINES: A rich double bock, Trappist ale ore barley wine.
  
  PIZZA: A Vienna-style lager.
  
  SAUSAGES AND SMOKED MEAT: Kolsch, Altbier or Vienna-style lager.

  A note about Molasses Cookies: Molasses cookies are very common, but
  they are not easy to make, the reason being that there is no rule you
  can work by which will answer in all cases. All molasses does not
  work alike. Some kinds will bear more water than others, and the
  weather has to be taken into consideration. You can use more water in
  cold weather than warm, at times 1/2 molasses, 1/2 water. Be very
  careful and do not work more than necessary to mix.

      Title: Crab Alfredo Sauce
 Categories: Salsa/sauce, Fish/seafoo
      Yield: 2 servings
 
MMMMM---------------------FROM: KATHY PITTS--------------------------
      6 oz (To 8 oz) cooked snow crab
           -meat, cut into chunks
      4 tb Butter or margarine
      4 tb Flour
      2 c  Half-and-half (heavy cream
           -if you REALLY feel wicked)
    1/2 c  (About) grated Parmesan
           -cheese (or more to taste)
           Salt to taste
           White pepper to taste
        pn Cayenne pepper (optional)
 
  Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in the flour, and cook briefly
  until the mixture looks sandy. Do NOT let it color. Wisk in the half-
  and-half, and stir until the mixture forms a thick sauce. Stir in the
  cheese, and season to taste. Simmer for a few minutes to blend the
  flavors, and stir in the crab meat. Cook JUST until the crab is
  heated through.
  
  Serve over cooked linguini, with additional Parmesan cheese and hot
  red pepper flakes on the side.
  
  Before some purist jumps me, I KNOW this isn't a classic Alfredo, but
  it is a very good dish, and remarkably easy to make. This may be
  varied by substituting cooked lobster meat for the crab, or by adding
  36 cooked, peeled and deveined medium shrimp, and about a quarter of
  a cup of chopped cooked broccoli instead of the crab meat.

      Title: Tocana de Vita (Romanian Beef Stew)
 Categories: Meats, Romanian, Soup/stew
      Yield: 5 servings
 
      1 lb Stew beef,veal or venison
      1 tb Fat
      1 c  Onion, minced
      1 x  Garlic bud
    1/2 ts Paprika
    1/4 ts Pepper
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Green pepper, minced
      2 c  Diced potatoes
      1 tb Flour
    1/2 c  Cold water
 
    Wash the meat in cold water, then let stand in the same. Brown
  onions in fat, add paprika and mix well. Add the meat, pepper, salt
  and garlic. Mix well, cover and let simmer for about 40 min. Add
  boiling water, green pepper and again let simmer for about 20 min.
  Mix the flour with cold water, add slowly to the meat and mix well.
  Simmer for about two minutes then set the stew aside.
    Place potatoes in salted water, bring to a boil and let boil for 5
  min. Remove potatoes from hot water and place in stew. Bring stew to
  a boil and simmer gently for about 5 min. Serve hot.
    Sorry about the translation, it was literal, from grama.
    In the old country they always washed the meat first before
  cooking, I always thought it was just because it was freshly
  butchered, but soaking the meat tenderizes it greatly, and adds
  liquid to the stew for gravy. Beef or Veal neck or shank works great,
  though venison neck works- add peeled chopped apple in last 5 min.
    Tocana(stew_) de vita is the food of life. ENJOY! mmm

      4 md Red bell peppers
           Olive oil
      1 c  Old-fashioned

      1 c  Heavy cream
           Salt and freshly ground
           -black pepper
    1/2 c  Plain dry bread crumbs
 
  1. Preheat the broiler. Halve the bell peppers crosswise. Remove and
  discard the stems, seeds and ribs. Using your hands, lightly rub the

  (Alternatively, grill the pepper cups on a hot grill, turning, until
  lightly charred.)
  
  2. In a large saucepan, bring 4 cups of lightly salted water to a
  boil over high heat. Gradually whisk in the grits. Reduce the heat to
  low, cover and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until the grits
  are tender, smooth and thick, about 20 minutes.
  
  3. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small nonreactive skillet over
  moderately high heat. Add the jalapeno and cook, stirring, until
  slightly soften, about 2 minutes. Stir the butter and jalapeno into
  the grits along with the heavy cream. Season well with salt and black
  pepper.
  
  4. Preheat the oven to 375F. Sprinkle half of the bread crumbs in the
  bottom of the 8 red pepper cups. Divide the grits among the pepper
  cups, mounding them slightly. Sprinkle the remaining bread crumbs on

  and refrigerate. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before
  proceeding.) Bake in the oven for about 15 minutes until hot. Serve at

      4    Extra large egg whites
      1 pn Salt
      1 c  Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
           ;extra cocoa powder for
           ;dusting sheets
 
  Preheat oven 300.  Grease 3 cookie sheets lightly and dust with cocoa
  powder.  Shake sheets lightly to completely cover with cocoa.  You
  will need about 3 cookie sheets because this recipe makes 50 cookies,
  and you will want to bake them one after another.
  
  Melt chocolate, then set aside to cool.
  
  Beat egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft peaks form.  The eggs
  must form soft peaks or the cookies will not hold their shape.
  
  Add sugar slowly and continue beating until very stiff and shiny.
  
  Using a spatula, fold in vanilla extract, melted chocolate, and 1T
  cocoa powder until incorporated.
  
  Drop on cookie sheets 1 heaping teaspoon at a time.  Space the
  mixture 2 inches apart.  They will have the shape of chocolate kisses.
  
  Bake 30-40 mins.  Remove cookies immediately from cookie sheet.  Cool
  completely and store in an airtight container.

      Title: Powter Strawberry Parfait
 Categories: Desserts, Fruit
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Strawberries; very ripe
           -fresh pureed, or 2 10oz
           -pks frozen with juice
      3 ts Plain gelatin
      6 tb Sugar
      4 tb Orange juice
    1/2 c  Chilled evap skim milk
 
  In a small saucepan combine strawberries, 4T sugar and 1t gelatin.
  Cook and stir over low heat until sugar and gelatin are dissolved. Do
  not let it come to a boil.  Pour into large mixing bowl and place in
  freezer to chill.
  
  Heat orange juice and 2t gelatin in saucepan until gelatin dissolves.
  This can boil softly.  Then keep on very low heat while preparing the
  next step.
  
  In a small mixing bowl, beat skimmed milk on very high speed until it
  becomes frothy (about 3 mins).  While mixing, pour the warm orange
  juice mixture into the milk mixture.  The milk will start to thicken
  and become creamier as the orange juice mixture cools.  When this is
  accomplished, remove from mixer and set aside.
  
  Take the strawberry mixture from the freezer and mix on high speed
  until it becomes creamy (about 3 mins).
  
  Fold the two mixtures together until well incorporated.
  
  Pour the parfait into champagne glasses.  Chill for 30 mins and serve
  plain or with fresh berries on top.  If you need to chill it longer,
  take it out of the frig 30 mins before serving.

      Title: Mark's Version of Falafels
 Categories: Appetizers, Middle east, Snacks
      Yield: 1 recipe
 
      2 c  Chick peas
      4 ea Garlic cloves, minced
      1 sm Onion, minced
      1 tb Coriander
  1 1/2 tb Cumin
           Several dashes tabasco
      3 tb Wholewheat flour
           Salt & pepper
    1/4 c  Parsley, minced
           Stock, as needed
 
  Soak chick peas, rinse well, cover with fresh water, bring to a boil &
  simmer until very tender.  Depending on how fresh the chick peas are
  will determine how long this will take.  Give them about 1 1/2 hours.
  Drain well & set aside to cool.
  
  When cool, place chick peas in food processor bowl & blend until very
  smooth.  If you have a large enough bowl, add the rest of the
  ingredients, except the stock, & mix in the blender.  If the bowl is
  not large enough, you will have to do this in batches.  Then add the
  ingredients in order, mixing well after each addition.  Add a little
  stock if the mixture appears too dry or looks as if it is not going
  to hold together very well. Cover & set aside for 30 minutes.
  
  Shape into patties.  If the patties do not hold together very well,
  you may want to add a little more flour, but be careful, you do not
  want to make them too floury.  Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet
  & gently flatten. This amount should make 15 to 18 patties, so make
  them a reasonable size. Preheat the oven to 350F.  Bake the falafel
  patties for 5 minutes, remove trays, flip the patties & return to the
  oven for another 5 minutes. Remove from trays & cool on wire racks.
  
  To serve: Heat some olive oil in a good heavy skillet, you can
  choose: I use 2 tb of olive oil, or you could deep fry them in a wok.
  If using the wok method, crumble one dried red chile into the oil as
  it is heating. When the oil is hot, fry the falafel patties until
  golden. Flip & fry the other side.  Remove from the oil, drain &
  serve.
  
  Either serve the falafel as part of a Middle Eastern platter
  including some baba ganouj, hummus, tabouleh, lettuce, tomatoes,
  green onions & pita. Or, make up a sauce using tahini & hot sauce,
  warm a pita bread, slice the top off, spread the tahini paste in the
  pita, drop in two patties, cover with lettuce, tomatoes & green
  onions.  Either a great snack or a main meal.

      Title: Tomato-Basil Soup
 Categories: Appetizers, Soup/stew, Vegetables, Tomatoes
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Tomatoes, diced
      2 ea Garlic cloves, coarsely
           -- chopped
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/4 c  Dry red wine
      5 c  Vegetable stock
      1 cn Tomato paste, optional
      2 bn Basil, coarsely chopped
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  The tomatoes need to be diced into bite-sized pieces.  Set aside.
  
  Heat olive oil until it is warmed.  Add the garlic & saute it very
  gently only until it becomes fragrant.  Add the tomatoes, stir once &
  add the remaining ingredients except the basil & salt & pepper. Raise
  the heat a little, cover & let the soup cook gently without ever
  letting it quite come to the boil.  Let it cook like this for 45
  minutes. You want the tomatoes to be softened.  Add the seasonings &
  the basil. Cook long enough to warm the basil through.  Serve with
  freshly baked, crusty, Italian bread.
  
  MARK'S NOTE: If you want a thin soup, omit the tomato paste.  If you
  want it to be thicker, add the paste, but it will make quite a
  difference to the texture of the soup.  If serving as a lunch, or
  with only a light main course, then the paste makes this a rich &
  satisfying soup: if serving purely as an appetizer, then omit the
  tomato paste.
  
  Also, do not let the soup come to a full rolling boil.  It is best
  served warmed.  Once you add the basil, you may want to switch the
  heat off & let the soup sit for a while, reheating just before
  serving.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Lean lamb, ground
      2 sl Bread, toasted, crushed
      1 ts Allspice, pounded
      1 ts Coriander, crushed
      1    Garlic clove, crushed

      2    Tomatoes, sliced thin
           Vinegar & oil to taste
      1 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      1 c  Plain yogurt

MMMMM------------------------INSTRUCTIONS-----------------------------
 
  In a large bowl, combine the ground lamb with the bread, allspice,
  coriander, garlic, onion, savory, and salt and pepper, and knead
  thoroughly.  The mixture should be spicy, though not too herby, and
  hold its shape.  Break into 5 sections, each as large as a navel
  orange, then break each section into 6 balls.  Knead and flatten
  slightly to a thickness of about 3/4".  Cut the bacon slices into
  widths equal to these balls, keeping the slices of bacon between
  them. Slip a cane skewer through the centers and roll gently with the
  palms to smooth the edges.
  
  (There will be 5 or 6 skewers, depending on their length.) Cover and
  refrigerate overnight.  When ready to cook, set on a broiler tray or
  grill and cook under moderate heat, turning every 5 minutes. (The
  bacon will baste the meat.)  The surface will be crusty and the
  inside cooked within 25 minutes.
  
  To serve:  Put out the bread, meat, tomatoes seasoned with the
  vinegar and oil, parsley and yogurt in separate dishes. Guests may
  open pocket bread and stuff them with meat and seasonings.

      2 ts Minced Garlic
    1/2 ts Dried oregano, crushed
    1/2 ts Salt

           Tomato
      1 c  Peeled, seeded diced
           Cucumber
      1 c  Plain yogurt
 
  Instructions:
  
  Combine wine, oil, garlic and oregano, salt, and pepper. Cut steak
  into strips, 2" long by 1/4" wide,or as thin as possible. Pour wine
  marinade over beef strips, and let stand for 1 hour at room temp.
  Drain meat strips and cook in two batches, in hot butter, stirring,
  for 2 to 3mins, or until brown on all sides. Serve meat in a chafing
  dish or a hot tray to keep warm. Open one end of pita to make pocket.
  Set out dishes of lettuce, tomato, cucumber and yogurt. Allow each
  person to fill his own pita. The restaurant type gyros are made of
  compressed meat and roasted on a vertical skewer. (meat consists of
  various cuts of beef that are chopped, minced or ground and then
  compressed into large cylindrical shape) This recipe is a good
  substitute for the the commercial type. Note: Commercial yogurt can
  be thickened by placing a double layer of paper towels directly over
  the top of yogurt to absorb the liquid. Refrigerate overnight and
  remove paper.

    1/2 c  Tomato juice
 
  * Use any cut of beef roast desired.
  
  1. Cut beef roast into serving-sized portions. Use more beef if you
  need more than 6 servings. Brown beef in a bit of vegetable oil,
  although you can skip this step if rushed for time.
  
  2. Slice onion and separate into rings. Dice the peeled carrots, dice
  the celery and slice the peppers into thin strips or circles. Place
  these into bottom of crockpot. Sprinkle the beef pieces with fresh
  ground black pepper, minced garlic and the onion soup mix. Place on
  top of the vegetables.

  hurry, skip this step. Turn to low, cover and cook for 7-9 hours.
  
  * Keep the crockpot covered as much as possible throughout cooking
  time. A crockpot can be used to cook this type of meal for a varied
  amount of time, depending on your schedule. It is not important that
  you take the meat and vegetables out at a specific amount of time.
  One or two hours either way usually makes no difference.
  
  When ready to serve, dip meat and vegetables out of pot with a slotted
  spoon. Use the liquid as is or turn crockpot to high and thicken
  liquid with a little flour or cornstarch.

      2    Jalapeno peppers --
           Optional
      1 cn Beer
 
  * Have beef chopped, not ground.
  
  1. Heat oil in a large heavy skillet. Add garlic, onions and green
  pepper. Saute until soft, about 5-7 minutes.
  
  2. Add beef and lightly brown on all surfaces. Drain off some of the
  fat if a lot has accumulated. Lean beef trimmed of all fat should not
  have an excess amount, however.
  
  3. Add remaining ingredients and simmer for 1 hour or slightly
  longer. Put a cover on skillet during cooking time, and slightly tilt
  it so steam can escape. Check often and stir to prevent sticking.
  Skim off fat as it rises. Best if allowed to sit, tightly covered,
  for an hour after cooking is complete.
  
  Serving Ideas:  Serave with cornbread or cheese biscuits.
  
  NOTES:  This chili can be mild or very hot depending uipon the use of
   jalapeno peppers.  Some chili lovers say you should never put beans
   in chili, so this recipe omits them.  This recipe is from a truck
   driver named Sparky that we met in Arizona, a firm believer in
   no-bean chili.

  1 1/2 c  Ground round
      1    Whole onion -- chopped
      1 c  Mushrooms
      3 tb Margarine -- solid
  1 1/2 c  Sour cream
      1 ds Nutmeg
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Black pepper
      2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Shortening
      1    Egg
 
  This is an extremely easy and versatile meat pie. Use the hamburger
  meat in this recipe or use COOKED chopped beef roast or COOKED and
  chopped chicken in filling. Salt is to be divided between pastry and
  filling.
  
  1. Melt margarine in skillet. Saute the mushrooms, onions and lean
  ground round until lightly browned. Remove from heat and stir in 1/2
  cup sour cream, 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper and dash of nutmeg or
  allspice if desired. Set aside.
  
  2. Mix the flour, remaining salt and the sugar in a bowl. Cut the
  shortening in until mixture is crumbly. Mix egg yolk with remaining
  sour cream; add to flour mixture and mix well.
  
  3. Roll dough on floured surface and cut into 18 circles. Use a sour
  cream carton for circle size guide or any other cutter that will give
  you about 18 circles. Place 1 heaping teaspoon filling in center of
  each circle. Fold over and seal edges, pressing with a fork dipped in
  flour. Mix egg whites with 1 tablespoon water; brush over pies. Add a
  few sprinkles of sesame seed or celery seed at this point if desired.
  
  4. Bake in a preheated 400-degree oven for 15-20 minutes or until
  golden brown. Serve immediately. When rewarming these, do so slowly
  so sour cream will not curdle. Best warmed in oven.
  
  NOTES : Make these ahead of time to have on hand for sandwiches,
  school lunches or to take to work. They can be frozen for short
  periods of time; thaw partially and reheat slowly in oven. Recipe By

      1 qt Water
    1/2 ts Chili powder
      1 ts Salt -- to taste
      1 ts Black pepper -- fresh
           Ground
      1 c  Catsup
    1/2 c  Cider vinegar
    1/3 c  Worcestershire sauce
      4    Garlic cloves -- minced
    1/8 ts Hot pepper sauce
 
  * DO NOT attempt this recipe in a crockpot, since no evaporation takes
  place there.
  
  Combine all ingredients in a VERY large heavy pot. Simmer uncovered
  over low heat until beef falls to shreds, stirring occasionally. This
  will take 5 to 6 hours; watch carefully the last hour to make sure
  that it is not sticking. Mixture should be very thick. The mixture
  fills a large pot before cooking but becomes a small amount by the
  time it is cooked.
  
  While cooking I sometimes add chopped green peppers, celery, bay
  leaf, or carrots.
  
  Serve on hamburger buns with mustard.
  
  Serving Ideas : Serve with homemade cole slaw and baked beans.
  
  NOTES : This is a recipe I developed by trial and error and is now
  one of our all time favorites.

  often had to use the lowest price food and still get nutritional and
  good-tasting meals prepared. We still love this and often have it

 Categories: Bbq/grill, Meats, Poultry
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/4 c  Cream sherry
      3 tb Honey
    1/3 c  Soy sauce
    1/2 ts Fersh ginger root; grated
      2    Cl Garlic; pressed
      3 tb Vinegar
 
  Mix honey into sherry until smooth, add soy sauce. press garlic and
  add to the mixture. Grate ginger root and stir.
  
  Add 2 tbls vinegar - taste - if you want it more sour add 3rd tbls
  vinegar.
  
  Grill chicken as per your own liking, tourning often every 5-8 min to
  prevent charringand brush top side only after turning each side.
  
  If the sauce is to thin you can thicken it with a bit of cornstarch
  and water. When it is thick enough so it doesn't run off immediately
  you have it just right. Offer left over sauce for dipping chicken in.
  
  For mexican flavor add chili powder and cayenne to taste.
  
  For lamb add mint to basic sauce
  
  For beef add cinnamon and curry powder (madras) to basic sauce.
  
  For pork add brown sugar and cinnamon to basic sauce.
  
  For other variations, add pineapple chunks and/or bell pepper chunks,
  red, green, yellow make for great coor and taste. You can put in a
  touch of garlic and onion is always good in it.
  
  Of course the chunky stuff will have to be added after you are through
  BBQing and have it at the table for the dipping  or pouring over
  meat. Cook peppers, onions and garlic in the sauce after the bbqing
  is done. If y bbq with chunks they fall into bbq and give you a burnt
  smell.

  roots and 1/2 cup garlic. To store the pesto for later use, put in a
  glass jar, pour a little oil onto the surface to cover it and seal
  tightly. It will keep nicely for about 1 week in the refrigerator.

      1 tb Fish sauce
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
      4    Kaffir lime leaves
      1 tb Red chilies -- sliced
 
  Fry curry paste in oil over low heat for 1 minute. Add 1/4 cup thick
  coconut milk and chicken. Increase temperature to med-high and cook
  for about 5 mins or until the chicken is done. Add carrots and cook
  until almost tender.   Add the peas, fish sauce, sugar and the rest
  of the coconut milk. Stir and cover. Lower the temperature to
  medium-low and cook until a thin layer of oil appear on the curry
  surface. Turn off the heat and add Kaffir lime leaves, chilies and
  basils and stir once or twice. Replace the cover until ready to
  serve. Serve with cooked rice or boiled somen noodles. Makes
  approximately 3 1/2 cups of curry.
  
  NOTE:  Authentic Thai chicken curry does not include peas and carrots.
  However, due to the lack of Thai vegetables in the U.S., the Thai
  restaurant owners had to make some adjustments yet still maintain the
  real Thai taste, That's where the peas and carrots come into the
  picture. Enjoy!!  Happy (Thai) Cooking!! **:Gail in IL:** Formatted

 Categories: Thai, Meats
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    500 g  Steak -- cut into 2 cm
           Cubes
      1 c  Thin coconut milk
      1 c  Thick coconut milk
      1 tb Muslim curry paste
      1 md Potato -- cut into 2 cm
           Cubes
      1 sm Onion
     50 g  Raw peanuts -- skinned
      1 ts Cardamon pods
      1 tb Lemon juice
      3 tb Tamarind water
      1 tb Nam pla (Thai fish sauce)
           Red pepper -- sliced &
           Seeded
 
  Put the meat and coconut milk into a pan, bring to the boil and
  simmer for 20 mins. Remove the meat & pour out the coconut milk,
  leaving 4 tbs. in the pan. Stir in the curry paste, and cook until
  the paste smells cooked, that is it gives off a strong curry
  fragrance. Return the meat to the pan, toss it in the paste and fry
  for a further 3-4 mins. Pourthe remainder of the coconut milk back
  in, and simmer for a further 10 mins. until the suace thickens and
  the oil separates and forms a layer on the surface. Add the potato,
  onion, peanuts, cardamon, lemon juice, tamarind water, nam pla, and
  the thick coconut milk. Simmer for a further 30 mins. or until the
  meat and vegetables are cooked. Taste and adjust the seasoning with
  nam pla, lemon juice or tamarind as necessary. A few mins before
  serving, add the chilli.
  
  This gaeng is popular with the Thai Muslims, and they generally would
  not eat the other varieties of Thai curry. Buddhist (and the
  Christians) Thais are not so fussy, and eat Gaeng Masaman as well as
  the rest. Naturally, this is one dish in which one would not
  subtitute pork for the beef.

      Title: Green Chicken Curry (Gaeng Kiow Wahn Gai)
 Categories: Thai, Poultry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Chicken Breast
      2    Chicken Thighs
    1/2 c  Coconut Cream
    1/4 c  Green Curry Paste
      3 c  Coconut Milk
  1 1/2 c  Diced Eggplant
      2 tb Fish Sauce
      1 tb Palm or Brown Sugar
    1/2 ts Coriander leaves
    1/2 c  Basil leaves
      3    Red chilis
 
  1. Bone and skin the chicken breast and thighs, you should have about
  1lb of meat. Cut the meat into large, bite sized pieces, and set
  aside.
  
  2. In a medium, heavy bottomed saucepan, warm the coconut cream over a
  medium heat until it boils gently. Adjust the heat to maintain a
  gentle boil and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. The
  coconut cream will become fragrant as it thickens. When you see tiny
  pools of oil glistening on the surface add the curry paste and stir
  to dissolve it into the coconut cream. Continue cooking for 1 to 2
  minutes, until the curry paste has a pleasing aroma.
  
  3. Add the chicken pieces and stir fry for 1-2 minutes to coat them
  evenly with the paste. Cook for about 2 minutes. Increase the heat
  and add the coconut milk, eggplant, fish sauce, sugar and salt and
  stir well. Stir in the coriander, adjust the heat to maintain a
  gentle active boil and cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  Taste and adjust the seasoning with a little more fish sauce, sugar,
  or curry paste.
  
  4. When the chicken is done, and the eggplant is just tender, remove
  from the heat and transfer to a serving bowl. Scatter basil leaves,
  chopped chillis and some coriander on the top. Serve.
  
  Preparation in advance:
  
  Prepare it up to the point where you add the coriander, except *DO
  NOT* add the eggplant. Cool to room temperature, cover, and
  refridgerate for up to 24 hours. To serve bring the curry back to a
  gentle boil over a medium
  
  heat. Add the eggplant and carry on with the normal instructions from
  there.
  
  An alternative to the eggplant is Snow Peas. I personally prefer
  them, but both work well.

      1 lg Whole chicken
  1 1/2 ts Salt
  3 1/2 c  Rice
    1/4 c  Hot chicken fat or oil
      1    1 x 1/8" piece ginger --

      5    Cloves garlic -- minced
      4 c  Homemade chicken broth --

MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE SAUCE----------------------------
    1/2 c  Yellow bean sauce (Toa Geo
  1 1/2 tb Ginger -- minced
      1 ts Garlic -- minced
      1 ts Vinegar
      1    Chili -- chopped (optional)
 
  (Thai Garlic Rice and Chicken) To make chicken: Fill a large pot with
  enough water to boil a whole chicken. Bring the water to a rapid boil
  and slowly lower the chicken into the water. Let sit for 5 minutes
  then take it out. Dip the chicken in another pot of cold water and
  let sit 5 minutes.
  
  Repeat this procedure 3 to 4 times or until the chicken is cooked
  through but not overcooked. This keeps the chicken very moist inside.
  Place the cooked chicken in a container and cover tightly until ready
  to serve. Reserve the broth to cook the rice with. Wash and drain the
  rice, set aside. Saute garlic in oil over low heat only until
  fragrant but not brown. Add rice and saute 5 minutes longer. Transfer
  to the rice cooker and add ginger, salt and chicken broth and let it
  cook. Serve with sliced chicken, sliced fresh cucumber and sauce.
  
  To make sauce: Combine all the ingredients in a blender and blend for
  5 to 10 seconds. Add a little water if the mixture is too thick. The
  sauce should be on the watery side. NOTE: Chicken broth may be made
  ahead of time by boiling the wing tips, neck, ect. and then freezing.
  Remove the solid fat on top once cold but before frozen. Thaw and use
  in this recipe. The broth must be cooled before adding to the rice.

    1/2 c  All purpose flour
    1/2 c  Rice flour
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb White sesame seeds
  1 3/4 c  Coconut milk
    1/2 c  Sweetened coconut flakes
      4 c  Oil for frying (approx.)
 
  Heat oil in a large frypan or a wok over medium heat. Meanwhile,
  combine all purpose flour, rice flour, sugar, salt, sesame seeds,
  coconut milk and coconut flakes in a bowl and stir to mix well. Drop
  a few pieces of plantains at a time into the bowl and coat each piece
  well with a spoon. The batter should be on the thicker side so it can
  cling to the bananas. When the oil reaches the proper temperature,
  carefully drop the plantains pieces in hot oil. Fry until medium
  brown on both sides, turning occasionally. Drain on a cake rack over
  a cookie sheet. Serve with hot or cold beverages. Makes 27 pieces.
  NOTE: Try to find ripest plantains possible. If using regular
  bananas, reduce sugar by 1 tbsp. and cut 4 pieces to a banana only.
  Sweet potatoes and/or taro roots, cut french fries style (large
  pieces) may also be used with or instead of bananas. Some Thai
  grocery stores carries fresh Thai bananas called Kluay Nam Wa. That
  is the best kind to use in this recipe.

  Soak dried chilies in hot water for 15 minutes and deseed. In a wok
  over low heat put the shallots, garlic, galangal, lemon grass,
  cloves, coriander seeds, cumin seeds and dry fry for about 5 minutes,
  then grind into a powder (with mortar and pestle).
  
  Into a blender, put the rest of the ingredients except the shrimp
  paste and blend to mix well.  Add the shallot-garlic-galangal-lemon
  grass-clove-coriander seed-cumin seed mixture and the shrimp paste and
  blend again to obtain 1/2 cup of a fine-textured paste.
  
  This can be stored in a glass jar in the refrigerator for about 3-4
  months.

      Title: Nam Prik Kai Kem
 Categories: Salsa/sauce, Appetizers
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      3    Yolks from salted eggs
      1 lg Whole jalapeno pepper -- (or
           To taste)
      5    Cloves garlic
      2 tb Fresh lime juice
  1 1/2 tb Fish sauce (Nam Pla)
      1 tb Sugar
      1 ts Shrimp paste (Kapee)
           Fresh vegetables -- *
 
  (Thai Salted Eff Yolk Chili Dip) Place shrimp paste, garlic and chili
  in a piece of foil and roast on the stove burner for 30 seconds or
  until lightly fragrant. Using a mortar and pestle or a blender, pound
  garlic, chili and shrimp paste finely. Add salted egg yolks, fish
  sauce, lime juice, sugar and blend well. Serve with cooked rice,
  meat, omelet and vegetables. Makes about 1/2 cup of dip. * Cucumbers,
  carrots, cabbage, green beans, tomato wedges, zucchini, asparages,
  etc., raw or steamed, cut in bite size pieces.
  
  NOTE ABOUT THIS RECIPE AND EATING THAI FOOD IN GENERAL: For those of
  you who really want to try a Thai dish that you can't get in any Thai
  restaurant, here's one. In the old days, Thai people did not use any
  utensils for eating. They used their hands (except for soupy dishes)
  and they sat on the floor. One of the most popular daily dishes that
  almost every family won't do without is Nam Prik (chili dip). Nam
  Prik is considered better for your health because it contains very
  little or no fat. It can be served with any kind of meat but usually
  fish, along with fresh vegetables, omelet and rice (can you see the 4
  basic food groups here?). It enhances other food's flavor since it's
  very strong, so use it sparingly. It's also called "farmer's supper"
  or "poorman's supper" because of the cost of the ingredients. If you
  want to try eating it by hand like the traditional Thais be sure to
  give everyone his/her individual bowl of water on the side to dip
  their hands in since rice tends to stick to your hands after awhile.
  DO NOT lick your fingers, it's considered a bad manner. Use the water
  bowl provided. And never return any half bitten food to the dip,
  since that's unsanitary. To successfully get the rice from the plate
  to your mouth, without even dropping a grain, dip the meat and
  vegetable in the chili dip then place them on a mound of rice. Then
  squeeze the whole thing together to form a rice ball and enjoy. Shake
  off any excess water from hand before returning to the plate for
  better grips. This and the following recipes are usually served with
  boiled or fried fish, boiled shrimps and raw or cooked vegetables.
  They are very tasty.

  (Thai Vinegar with Chili) To make the nam som prik dong (vinegar with

  never metal (peanut butter jar works well for me). Put one part

  the jar. Stir to mix well and that's it. Keep in the fridge or at

  This recipe is the closest I've found to what I get at my favorite
  Thai restaurant in Denver. I usually double the recipe because I've
  never served more than 2-3 people on one batch and I love the
  leftovers. If you aren't familiar with Thai cooking you may be
  tempted to leave out the fish sauce or substitute ketchup. DON'T! The
  results are not the same. This recipe is served over the bean sprouts
  although they can be mixed in depending on your preference. To get
  the best results from your sprouts put them in a large bowl filled
  with cold water and ice cubes and let them soak for about 15 minutes
  or so. This revives them and makes them really crunchy. In Thailand
  this dish is usually made with dried shrimp but for American
  preferences fresh is usually used.  This recipe is altered slightly
  from the book to make it like what I'm so addicted to at J's noodles.
  It's long and the first time I made it, it took me close to an hour
  but now I can make a double batch in about 25 minutes. I do all the
  prep while the noodles soak.

  1. Soak noodles for 20-25 minutes in enough warm water to cover them.
  They should be flexible and soft, but not so soft that they can be
  mashed easily with the fingers. Later cooking in liquid will soften
  them more. Drain them thoroughly in a colander while preparing the
  other ingredients. Traditionally they are left in full-length
  strands, but you may cut them into 8" lengths if you find it easier
  to stir-fry then that way. 2. Peel and devein the shrimp leaving the
  tails intact (or remove if preferred). Slice chicken, pork into 1/8"
  strips 1 to 2" long. 3. Mix the fish sauce, sugar, vinegar, and
  paprika in a bowl and stir until the sugar dissolves. Set aside.
  Slice green onions both the green and white parts, diagonally into
  1-1/2" long pieces. Set aside. 4. Heat a wok, add the oil and swirl
  over the surface. Add the garlic and stir fry until light golden. Add
  the meat and stir-fry until shrimp is pink. If using chicken or pork
  stir-fry until pink disappears. Add the noodles and toss lightly to
  coat with oil and the distribute meat and garlic (I often do this in
  a larger pot since things tend to come out of the wok.) 5. Add the
  liquid from step 3 and bring it to a boil rapidly, gently folding the
  noodles without breaking them. Reduce heat to medium and boil the
  mixture, folding frequently until the noodles have absorbed the
  liquid (I find a pasta server works great for this step.) 6. Lift the
  noodles gently from one side of the wok. Pour a little oil along the
  side of the wok, then break the egg ad slip it into the oil. Break
  the yolk and cover the egg with the noodles immediately. Repeat this
  on the opposite side with the other egg. Allow eggs to cook
  undisturbed, over moderate heat until they are set and almost dry.
  Additional oil may by added if the eggs or the noodles begin to stick
  to the wok. 7. When the eggs are set and almost dry, fold them gently
  but rapidly into the noodles. Try not to break the noodles, which
  will be soft and fragile at this point. An effective way is to insert
  the scoop under the eggs, lift it through, and fold the mixture over.
  Continue the lifting and folding motion until the eggs are broken up
  and well distributed. 8. Add the green onions (and bean sprouts if
  you prefer them mixed in) and toss the entire mixture quickly and
  gently, still avoiding breaking the noodles. Cook for about 2 minutes
  or until onions are tender. 9. Take a large platter spread with bean
  sprouts (if you left them out above). Spread Pud Thai from wok over
  top. Sprinkle ground chilies (see note) and ground peanuts over the
  top and squeeze lime over the top. Or serve toppings separately for
  each diner to add according to taste.
  
  Variation: Omit shrimp pork and or chicken and ignore instructions for
  them. Substitute 1/4 pound tofu and 1/4 pound dried shrimp. Put the
  tofu on a triple layer of paper towels, cover it with another layer
  of triple towels, put a plate on top of that and a 2-pound can on the
  plate. Let stand for 20-30 minutes to press out

  transfer the peanuts to the container of a food processor or blender,
  along with 1 T of the peanut oil (reserve the rest) and blend them to
  a rough paste. Add the chiles, ginger, garlic and continue to blend.
  Add the remaining ingredients except the cilantro, and blend until

  seconds. Add shrimp and toss until they turn pink, for beef or pork
  until light brown, no more that 1 min. for shrimp. Remove from pan
  and set aside. Add the egg to pan and tilt the pan to spread it into
  a thin sheet. As soon as it begins to set, scramble it to break it
  into small lumps. Remove and set aside with shrimp. Heat 1 tbs of oil
  in wok or skillet and heat 30 seconds and add soften noodles. Thin
  noodles to cover the surface of the pan, then clump them together and
  gently turn over. repeat this process until the noodles soften and
  curl into ivory ringlets. Add fish sauce and turn noodles to evenly
  season. Add sugar and peanuts and continue to turn the noodles to
  season. Reserve some of the bean sprouts, green onion for garnish.
  Add the bean sprouts, green onions and the shrimp and egg mixture.
  Cook for 1 minute, turning often. Transfer noodles to the serving
  paltter and squeeze the juice of 2 lime wedges over the top. Garnish
  with remaining beansprouts and lime and serve at once. Serves 1 very
  hungry, or 2 appetizers.

      Title: Pineapple And Papaya W/Sticky Rice
 Categories: Desserts, Fruit
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           FULLER PRFX84A
  1 1/2 c  Sweet rice (glutinous rice)
      2 c  -water
  1 2/3 c  Coconut milk (canned is fine
           If it's unsweetened)
    1/3 c  Palm or light brown sugar
    1/2 ts -salt
      1 sm Pineapple -- (try to get
           One
           Pretty top)
      1    3 to 4 pound Mexican Papaya
      1 tb Granulated sugar
      2 tb Lime juice
 
  Wash the rice thorougly; put it in a pot with the water and bring to a
  rolling boil. Turn heat way down and barely simmer for 20 minutes. It
  won't be as fluffy as regular rice, but it shouldn't be too wet or it
  won't absorb the coconut milk that comes next. While the rice is
  cooking, boil 1 C. of the coconut milk until reduced to 2/3 C. Mix
  the coconut milk, palm or brown sugar, and salt together, and then
  add the rice. Set aside, and allow it to cool. Boil the last 2/3 C.
  coconut milk down until there's only about 1/4 C. of it left. Take
  the rice mixture and mound it in the center of a big serving plate.
  Spread the reduced coconut milk over the mound of rice. NOW,
  carefully cover the rice mound and chill it.
  
  Peel and cut up the pineapple into 3/4" chunks, saving a few long
  spears for garnish. Peel and cut up the papaya into 3/4" chunks, and
  then mix the papaya with the lime juice and the granulated sugar. Mix
  the pineapple chunks and the papaya chunks together and chill. (Also
  chill the pineapple spears.) I only chilled my fruit and rice for
  about 3 hours; if you want to make it ahead I think at least the
  fruit should be served on the same day it's cut.
  
  About an hour before dinner you can put the fruit and rice together.
  If the top of the pineapple was pretty, put it on the serving plate
  next to the rice. Drain the pineapple and papaya mixture - it doesn't
  have to be bone dry, but you don't want it soupy. Spoon the fruit
  mixture around the rice. Take the reserved pineapple spears and cut
  them into slices that will fit over the mound of rice and look pretty.
  
  If you have any just sitting around, fresh mint makes a nice garnish.
  Also, the lime juice and granulated sugar were only used because the
  papaya I had was kind of dull tasting. This was a big hit with my
  friends, I think because it was so cooling after all that spicy hot
  food. Anyway, I kept my crown as the dessert queen. A big thank you
  to Sopit for her encouragement. Kelly in San Diego

      Title: Roasted Chili Paste - Nahm Prik Pao
 Categories: Thai, Condiments
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 c  Small Dried Red Chilies
    1/2 c  Unpeeled Shallots -- Halved
           Lengthwise
    1/4 c  Unpeeled Garlic Cloves
           Halved Lengthwise
    1/2 c  Vegetable Oil
 
  In a wok or small, heavy skillet, dry-fry the chilies over low heat
  until they darken and become fragrant and brittle, about 5 minutes.
  Shake the pan and stir frequently as they roast. Remove from the heat
  and transfer to a small plate to cool.  In the same pan over medium
  heat, dry-fry the shallots and garlic, turning occasionally, until
  they are softened, wilted and blistered, 5 minutes.  They should have
  small, black burnt spots but not be burned all over. Remove from the
  heat and transfer to a small plate to cool. Stem the chilies and
  shake out and discard most of the seeds. Cut the chilies into small
  pieces. Trim the shallots and garlic, discarding the peels and root
  ends, and cut them into small pieces. Combine the chilies, garlic and
  shallots in a large, heavy mortar. Pound and grind with a pestle
  until you have a fairly smooth paste, 20 to 30 minutes. Use a spoon
  to scrape the sides down now and then. Set aside. In a wok or small,
  deep skillet over medium heat, warm the oil for 1 minute. Add the
  paste and cook, stirring occasionally until the paste slowly darkens
  to a deep brownish black and releases a rich fragrance, about 5
  minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer the chili paste, with it's
  oil, to a jar. Cool to room temperature uncovered, then seal tightly.
  It will keep at room temperature for 1 month. Makes about 1-1/2 cups.

 Categories: Thai, Poultry
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 c  Medium coconut milk
  1 1/2 c  Chicken stock
      3    Quarter-sized pieces dried
           Galangal (kha), or 6
           Pieces fresh galangal
      4    Stalks fresh lemon grass --
           Bruised, cut into 2-
 
  Serrano chiles, sliced into rounds 1 large whole chicken breast, cut
  into 1/2-inch pieces (with or without bones, see note) 4 tablespoons
  fish sauce (nam pla) 5 fresh Kaffir lime leaves (makrut), if
  available 2 fresh limes, juice 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves
  Combine coconut milk, chicken stock, galangal, lemon grass and 4 of
  the chiles in a saucepan; bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer
  for 20 minutes.  Strain stock; discard galangal and lemon grass.
  Return stock to a boil, add chicken and simmer until tender, about 2
  minutes.  Add fish sauce, citrus leaves and remaining chiles.  Stir
  in the lime juice. Garnish with coriander.
  
  NOTE:  I like to use boned chicken breast if I'm cooking for guests.
  For the best flavor, however, use a whole small chicken chopped into
  small pieces with the bones; increase the cooking time until chicken
  is tender.

      Title: Thai Ginger Candy
 Categories: Thai, Desserts
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     68    GAEW SHIMIZU
     14 oz Young ginger -- peeled and
    1/8    " thick pieces
  8 1/2 c  Sugar
      2 c  -water
      8 ts -salt
      2 ts Lime juice
 
  1. Place ginger slices in a pot and pour in enough water to cover all
  the pieces. Bring to a  gentle boil and let the boiling continue for
  several
  
  minutes then drain. Repeat this procedure 3-4 times to get rid of the
  spiciness.
  
  2. Poke holes in the gingers with a fork or a bamboo skewer and blot
  with paper towels (doing this will assure proper absorption of
  syrup). Place in a glass jar big enough for ginger and syrup.
  
  3. In a pot, combine 1 1/2 cups sugar, 2 cups water, 2 tsp salt, 2
  tbsp lime juice and bring to a boil over medium heat. Remove from the
  heat and cool. Pour the syrup into the finger jar and cover tightly.
  Let stand overnight.
  
  4. Next day, pour out only the syrup into a pot and add 2 cups of
  sugar and 2 tsp salt. Bring to a boil or until sugar and salt is
  dissolved. Cool and return the syrup to the jar. Cover and let stan
  overnight.
  
  5. Next day, repeat step 4, but with only 1/2 cup sugar and let stand
  overnight again.
  
  6. Repeat step 5 once more but let stand 2 nights this time.
  
  7. Pour ginger/syrup into a strainer and discard the syrup. Spread
  ginger pieces in a single layer on a foil-lined cookie sheet and dry
  in the sun or in an oven (lowest heat) until the gingers become
  glazed or glisten and dried. Place in a large bowl or zip lock bag
  and coat with the remaining sugar (measured at the beginning of this
  recipe). Store in an airtight container. Keeps up to 4 months. Serve
  with unsweetened tea or other hot beverages. Happy (Thai) Cooking!!

  size of large green peas, and look pretty much the same.  Regular
  green peas may be used as substitute.
  
  Put the ingredients for the red curry paste into a mortar and pound
  until well mixed into a paste.  NOTE: You may use commercially
  available paste, if available.  Adjust the amount to taste.
  
  Debone the roast duck, and cut up the meat into bite-size rectangular
  pieces (leaving the skin on).  Cut the neck and wing into pieces.
  
  Place the coconut milk in a large saucepan and heat till boiling.
  Add duck pieces and cook till tender.  Put the coconut cream into a
  frying pan, add red curry paste.  Heat over fairly high heat, stiring
  constantly, till all the paste have mixed in and thoroughly heated.
  Add Kaffir Lime leaves, fish sauce (to taste), coconut sugar, and
  continue to heat (keep stiring all the time to prevent burning) until
  red oil starts to form on the surface of the "sauce".
  
  Add the "sauce" to the saucepan of duck and coconut milk, and bring
  back to a boil.  Add all remaining ingredients except the basils,
  which is to be added when the curry starts to boil.  Remove from heat
  and serve with plain boiled white rice.

 Categories: Thai, Salsa/sauce

     57    JASON HAAS
      2 pt Fish sauce -- I like golden
           Boy
      3 pt Sugar
      4 pt Rice wine vinegar --
           (seasoned or not it
           Matter)
    1/2 pt Chili garlic sauce -- (any
           Kind will do)
 
  Put  all four ingredients into a stainless steel pan and heat to
  boiling. Cook untill the sugar is melted and cool.
  
  We use this sauce for Pad Thai, in fact that is what it was created
  for. But now we use it for all kinds of things. To make a quick
  cucumber and red onion pickle, peel your cucumber, seed it and cut it
  into half moons. Peel and cut your onion in half, and then in half
  moons. Toss with some of the sauce and you've got a good cucumber and
  red onion relish. To use it as nuoc cham, grate a carrot, chop a
  clove or two of garlic, chop some dry roasted peanuts, and thin the
  sauce down with water to taste. Add the carrots, garlic, and thined
  sauce together, let it sit for a few minutes and garnish with peanuts
  at service. With the nouc cham your looking for a light taste. The
  basic sauce recipe can make alot, at work we use a cup as the
  measure. You could use anthing you wanted, table spoons, quarter
  cups, half cups, I think the recipe would even work if you measured
  out in gallons. So good luck and let me know if you've tried this
  sauce, later I'll post a Pad Thai recipe using this same sauce. Jason

  (Thai Beef Salad) Here is a sure fire winner of a Thai dish. We call
  it beef salad and the Thai name is Yom Nua. To make it, use round
  steak or a roast. Slice it up into 1/2 to 3/4" slabs if it's thick.
  Sprinkle with meat tenderizer. Broil or grill until medium rare.
  Slice into strips about 1/8" thick. The strips should be bite sized.
  Slice red or yellow onion very thin and break up the rings. Use about
  1/2 onion per pound of meat. Place meat in a large bowl and add
  onions with some lemon juice, ground chili peppers, fish sauce (Nam
  Pla), and MSG. Mix it all together then mix in one thin sliced
  cucumber, 5 or 10 mint leaves, and a pinch of Chinese parsley
  (optional). Make a bed of lettuce and put the mixture on it. Serve
  with hot white rice. Wing Means, El Paso

  Steven Potovsky, chef at the Rivoli, 332 Queen St. W., served these
  yummy little Caribbean-inspired meatless dumplings at the recnt
  Toronto Taste '95, an anuual fundraiser for Second Harvest Food Bank.
  The delicious sauce gets its flavor from coconut and the unusual
  addition of dark ale. Potovsky uses a Jamaican pumpkin called
  calabeza (sold in Caribbean food shops and some supermarkets) along
  with squash for his; ours were delectably made with squash alone.
  
  
  Place squash on baking sheet in preheated 350 F oven about 50 minutes
  or until tender. Cool; discard skin. Place squash in food processor
  with egg, green onion, allspice, thyme, oregano, and salt, processing
  with on/off motion until smooth. In bowl, combine mixture with flour,
  mixing just until blended.
  
  Drop batter by tablespoonfuls into large saucepan of boiling water,
  about 12 at a time. Cook about 3 minutes, or until dumplings rise to
  surface. Transfer to bowl with slotted spoon; toss with oil to
  prevent from sticking.
  
  Heat oil in large skillet or saucepan;  add onion, garlic and hot
  pepper flakes, cooking about 4 minutes or until softened. Stir in
  curry powder; cook 1 minute, then add dumplings, stirring gently to
  coat with spices. Add coconut milk, beer, spinach, tomato and salt.
  Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer about 7 minutes. Stir in green
  onions. garnish with coriander.

 Categories: Bbq/grill, Vegetables
      Yield: 8 servings

  Combine all ingredients, except in bacon, in large ovenproof
  container. Lay bacon strips on top.  Place on smoker grid and smoke
  for 2 to 2-1/2 hours.
  
  Note from me:  If you don't have a smoker, you can cook at about 350
  F for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the bacon is curling.  Better
  flavor in a smoker, but divine beans without!
  
  This is undoubtedly one of the best baked bean dishes we've ever
  tasted. Easy to make and no tending necessary.  You can have ribs
  smoking on the bottom rack and beans on the top rack.  Add garlic
  bread and coleslaw, potato salad or macaroni salad and you've got a
  Super Bowl party, bowl game or Monday Night Football dinner!

 Categories: Appetizers, Meats, Bbq/grill, Dips/spread
      Yield: 1 1/2 cups
 
      1 c  Sour cream
      1 tb Plus 1 tsp. prepared
           -horseradish
      1 sl From a medium onion, about
           -1/3 inch thick
           Oil, preferably canola or
           -corn
      3    To 4 slices bacon, chopped
      2 oz Fresh mild goat cheese, at
           -room temperature
           Potato chips and carrot
           -sticks
 
  Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 200 to
  220 F.
  
  Spoon the sour cream and 1 Tbsp. of the horseradish into a smokeproof
  baking dish.  Rub the onion slice with the oil.  Place the sour cream
  and onion in the smoker side by side and cook for 30 to 40 minutes.
  The sour cream should be runny but not separated, and the onion well
  softened but not cooked through.
  
  While the sour cream and onion cook, fry the bacon in a small skillet.
  Drain the bacon.
  
  Stir the cheese into the sour cream until well combined.  Chop the
  onion and crumble the bacon.  Mix into the sour cream. Add as much of
  the remaining teaspoon of horseradish as desired.  The smoked
  horseradish will mellow in flavor, and any added at the end create a
  pleasantly pungent bite.

    1/2 c  Catsup

    1/2 c  Good wine or cider vinegar
      2 tb Raw turbinado sugar, brown
           -sugar, honey or molasses

           Dried whole or crushed red

      1    Clove garlic, crushed
      1 tb Soy sauce
      1 ts Dried thyme, oregano, or
           -sage
    1/2 c  Sliced onions
 
  Stir the Brine ingredients to dissolve. Rinse and wash the pork in
  running water. Immerse the pork chunks in brine poured into heavy
  plastic bags. Force the air from the bags and seal.
  
  Marinate the pork for 12 to 18 hours in the refrigerator, turning
  twice. The meat should "cure" to a light gray and become firm.
  
  SMOKING:
  
  Prepare electric smoke oven with at least a quart of water and a good
  handful of wook chips or twigs.  Use hardwoods or fruitwoods in the
  chip tray.  Soak them to prolong the smoke. Spray racks with
  vegetable cooking spray. Place pork on racks without piercing with a
  fork. Smoke the meat at a bare sizzling temperature (175 degrees F)
  for 4 to 4 1/2 hours. Replenish the water pan or chip tray if
  necessary.
  
  Remove pork and disconnect smoker. Allow the meat to cool for half an
  hour. Trim the meat of skin and fat, and remove the meat from bones.
  Using a large knife or cleaver, slice, dice and mince the meat. The
  meat should still be slightly pink, even when fully cooked. This is a
  characteristic of smoke ovens.  (The cooking is not completed yet,
  however.)
  
  Simmer the sauce ingredients gently for 1 hour or until slightly
  thickened. Allow it to cook, stirring occasionally. Blend the minced
  pork with the sauce, reserving 1/2 cup of sauce for the table.  Pack
  into casserole dishes, cover, and heat in a 200 F oven for 1 hour.
  Uncover, stir, and serve.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Red-meated trout, 2 to 3
           -pounds
      2 ts Kosher salt
      2 ts Sugar
      1 c  (approximately) hardwood

           -alder
           Or fruitwood)
 
  From : Stephen Ceideburg; File/STEPHEN.TXT
  
  Filet the fish (or have the fishmonger do it), leaving the skin on.
  If you want a completely boneless filet, use tweezers or clean
  needle-nose pliers to remove the dozen or so pin bones running down
  the middle of the filet near the head end. Place the filets skin side
  down in a glass or stainless steel baking pan or other deep dish.
  
  Combine the salt and sugar and sprinkle a generous layer all over the
  fish, more thickly on the thickest part of the meat, a little less on
  the tail and edges. Use about a tablespoon in all for a 2-pound fish,
  the full amount for a 3-pounder. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours to
  overnight.
  
  Drain off any juices that have collected in the pan. Add cold water to
  cover, let stand 15 minutes, drain, and repeat. Drain well and pat
  dry with paper towels. For a smoother surface, lay the filets on a
  wire rack in a cool, breezy place for 15 minutes to dry.
  
  Build a small charcoal fire (10 to 12 briquets) at one edge of a
  covered grill and let it burn down until covered with gray ash.
  
  Meanwhile, soak 1/2 cup of the smoking chips in water. Cover the
  grill and adjust the vents on the top and bottom to maintain a
  temperature of about 200 degrees F. Drain the chips and add them to
  the coals; replace the grill with one handle nearest the fire, to
  facilitate adding smoking chips. Lay the filets on the opposite side
  from the fire, with the thickest parts nearest the heat. Cover and
  cook until the fish is opaque, 30 to 40 minutes. Add some dry smoking
  chips to the fire every 15 minutes or so to maintain smoke and heat.
  Serve hot or cold.

  FROM :    Fred Towner, Feb 28 91 7:32pm
  
  Use a fully cooked whole, shank or butt ham increasing cooking time
  for larger whole ham.  If a country ham is used soak it in water or
  apple cider (for a sweeter flavor) a few hours or overnight to remove
  some of the salty taste.
  
  Remove thick skin if a strong smoke flavor is desired.  Trim fat
  leaving no more than 1/2 inch thick covering.  Score ham.  Combine
  syrup, ginger, nutmeg and allspice.  Place ham in a large dish and
  baste with syrup mixture.  Let the ham stand in syrup for 1 to 2
  hours or until it reaches room temperature; baste frequently with
  syrup. When ready to smoke, remove ham from dish, stud with cloves
  and place on smoker grid.  Baste with syrup at least twice while
  smoking. Before last hour of smoking decorate with canned pineapple
  slices and cherries, baste again.  If using a meat thermometer, fully
  cooked ham should reach an internal temperature of from 130 F to 140
  F.  Make certain the thermometer is not touching the bone.
  
  Charcoal - use 7 - 8 pounds charcoal, 3 quarts hot water, 3-4wood
  sticks and smoke 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 hours.
  
  Electric - use 3 quarts hot water 3 - 4 wood sticks and smoke 2 to 3
  hours.

  Brine salmon chunks 8 or more hours, keeping refrigerated. (I do them
  overnight.)  Fill flavour pan with hickory, alder or mix 2/3 apple
  with 1/3 cherry.  Use 2 to 3 panfuls.  Leave in the smoker until
  drying is completed.  This may take 12 hours, depending on the
  thickness of the meat. Place largest and thickest chunks on the
  bottom rack.
  
  I also can my salmon in the 1/2 pt jars after I have smoked it or I
  freeze it.

      Title: Marinated Beef Brisket, Texas Style
 Categories: Bbq/grill, Meats, Salsa/sauce
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      1 tb Fresh lime juice
  1 1/2 tb Madeira wine
      3 tb Olive oil [use extra-virgin]
      1    Whole beef brisket - 4 to 5
           -pounds
 
  Texas Dry Rub - see recipe
  
  Combine the rub, lime juice, Madeira and olive oil in a blender.
  Process until it becomes a smooth paste.  Or combine the ingredients
  in a small nonreactive bowl and stir into a paste.  Scrape the paste
  from the blender or bowl.
  
  With your hands lightly oiled, rub the paste into the brisket,
  coating both sides well.  Cover the brisket with clear food wrap and
  marinate for a minimum of 36 hours in the refrigerator.
  
  Remove the brisket from the refrigerator and let it sit at room
  temperature (for about 1 hour) before you begin to cook.
  
  TO COOK OUTDOORS, use a covered kettle grill or water smoker.  In a
  kettle grill, indriectly cook the brisket over a water pan containing
  a basting liquid of water, orange juice, wine or something similar
  for about 2 hours per pound, refreshing the coals with damp smoking
  chips every couple of hours.  The brisket should have a dark crust
  when finished.  If you are using a water smoker, follw the
  manufacturer's instructions. Remove the brisket from the grill and
  let it stand for 10 minutes before slicing.
  
  TO COOK INDOORS, preheat the oven to 200F.  Put the brisket in a
  roasting pan and place in the center of the oven.  Roast for 2 hours
  per pound, undisturbed. Remove the brisket from the roasting pan and
  let stand for 10 minutes before slicing.  If you like, combine the
  pan juices with some warm barbecue sauce for serving.
  
  To serve, slice the brisket across the grain.  Place overlapping
  slices on a large platter, drizzle with barbecue sauce and garnish
  with grilled red onions rings.
  
  Yield:  10 to 12 servings.
  
  Author's note:  The trick behind a perfectly moist beef brisket is
  slow, even heat or smoke.  If you have a water smoker and access to
  mesquite chips or hard wood, Texas beef brisket takes on added depth.
  But you can get nice results indoors with your own oven.  The Texas
  Dry Rub becomes the basis of a smoky, savory paste.  Serve the
  brisket with your favorite barbecue sauce, a side of coleslaw and a
  garnish of sliced, grilled red onions.
  
  Note from me:  We us this recipe on a 3.25 pound eye of round roast
  and marinate in the refrigerator for 72 hours or more.  Delicious!
  The rub iss very hot, so I rub it off the roast before slicing so
  there is no overkill on heat.  We usually serve two sauces on the
  side:  homemade BBQ sauce and horseradish sauce.  Great with baked
  beans and homegrown tomato salad!

  well. Spread inside of flattened lamb leg with filling, keeping it in
  the center. Roll the lamb around the stuffing and tie with twine at
  1-1/2-inch intervals. For smoking, use a grill with a cover. Use hard
  wood or mesquite as fuel. Build a hot fire that is no longer flaming.
  Sear lamb until brown on all sides. Place lamb on platter until fire
  cools slightly, and spread with coating. More coating should be
  brushed on during smoking. Add lamb and smoke for approximately 1
  hour with cover on, turning often. Test lamb for doneness (should be
  pink). Let stand 10 minutes before removing string and slicing into
  filled rounds. Source: Calvert's Mustard Cookbook

  Number of Servings:  90
  
  Stick a knife into each roast in several places, making a deep
  puncture. With fingers, push 1 clove garlic in each hole, then a long
  pepper and a green onion.  Slice the pepper and onion off even with
  the surface of the meat.  Sprinkle the roasts with salt and red
  pepper.  When you get your fire going and are ready to put the meat
  on the smoker cooker, place some pre-soaked smoking wood (such as
  pecan or hickory) on the briquets.  Place seasonings in water pan,
  then add water all the way to the top of the pan. Place beef roast,
  then pork roast, in cooker and let them cook.  I usually put these on
  about 11 P.M. and let them cook while I sleep.  One 10-lb bag of
  charcoal will usually do.

  After making a small roux, add enough cold water to blend roux.  Then

  FROM :    Fred Towner, Feb 28 91 7:32pm
  
  Soaking the ham in burgundy, port or red wine will greatly improve the
  flavor and tenderness of a bone-in ham.  The wine removes any trace
  of salt from the ham and leaves it fork-tender and very sweet.
  
  Score ham, place on smoker grid and smoke according to cooking
  charts. Mix brown sugar, mustard, ginger and cloves, adding enough
  pineapple juice to make a rather thick paste.  Forty-five minutes
  before end of cooking time coat ham with brown sugar mixture and
  continue smoking.

  FOR SMOKING: Prepare home style smoker according to manufacturer's
  instructions. Have available chips of pecan wood and sugar cane if
  possible. In the water pan, place one quart of water and two cans of
  Barq's root beer. The root beer will give the chicken a taste that is
  certainly unique. Once smoker is ready, place water pan in position
  and add small amounts of pecan wood and sugar cane to hot coals.
  Place chicken breasts on middle smoker rack and cook according to
  directions. Check for doneness at one hour. The chicken breasts may
  be eaten warm on colored lettuces as an entree salad or sliced cold

      2 lb Pork sausage
      1 lb Hot pork sausage
      1    Chopped onion (how large,
           -well...how well do you like
           -them)
      1 cn Jalepeno Cheddar Cheese dip
    3/4 c  Crushed Doritos (Salsa or
           -Nacho flavor are the best)
      2    Eggs
           Garlic to taste
      2    Tablspoons cyanne(sp) pepper
           Any other items you like in
           -your meatloaf.
    1/2    Bottle of beer
           BBQ Sauce or Ketsup
    1/3 c  Terriyaki sauce
 
  Cooking  times will vary but this will work on almost any  type of
  covered BBQ or smoker. I don't like to fire  up  all  that often, and
  usually have company planned when I do one of these. So they are
  fairly large.
  
  In  a large bowl, or on the counter top (like I do it)  combine
  everything except the cheese dip and bbq sauce.
  
  Fix yourself a large sheet of aluminum foil. (I usually make it double
  wide). Move the meatloaf over onto the foil and form  a large  loaf.
  I also like to turn the edges of the foil  over  a couple of times,
  because of the weight.
  
  After you have formed the loaf, open the cheese dip and  spread over
  the top of the loaf. The spread BBQ sauce over the top  of the  cheese
  (Piquante  sauce  or  salsa  makes  an   excellent substitute for the
  BBQ sauce..I don't recommend ketsup at all.)
  
  When the coals are ready on your BBQ, put the meatloaf on,  and then
  put the cover on it. Usually takes around 45-60 minutes to cook.  Use
  a meat fork or an ice pick to put some holes in  the foil  after you
  get it on, so that the fat can drain off,  into the coals. I usually
  do a few around the edges, as well as some through  the  meat  in
  various places. Whenever I check  the meatloaf, I also check and make
  sure the grease is draining ok.
  
  Will  serve  at least two people. The doritos give the  loaf  a
  totally different flavour, and also combine to make  a  fairly tight
  meatloaf. Excellent sandwiches. Last time I did one at  a small
  party, it fed 16 people.

      Title: Smoked Red Bell Pepper Soup
 Categories: Bbq/grill, Chilies
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8 md Red bell peppers (about 3
           -lbs.)
      6 c  Chicken stock OR canned
           -broth (6 cups or more)
  1 1/2 lb Whole chicken breasts with
           -ribs
    1/4    Stick butter (2 tablespoons)
      2    Stalks celery - diced
      1 md Onion - diced
      4    Sprigs fresh thyme
      1    Bay leaf
      2 c  Whipping cream
 
  Salt and freshly ground black pepper
  
  Prepare smoker with hickory chips.  GREASE GRILL RACK and arrange
  peppers. Smoke 1-1/2 hours at 150F.  Peel, core and dice red peppers.
  
  Bring 6 cups stock to boil in medium saucepan.  Reduce heat so liquid
  is barely shaking.  Add chicken and simmer until firm to touch, about
  12 minutes.  Drain, reserving stock.  Skin and bone chicken, then
  dice.  Wrap in foil and refrigerate.
  
  Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add celery
  and onion and cook until tender, stirring occasionally, about 10
  minutes. Add peppers and stir 3 minutes. Add reserved stock, thyme
  and bay leaf and simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced to 4
  cups, about 1 hour.
  
  Add cream to soup and simmer until reduced to 4-1/2 cups, about 40
  minutes. Remove thyme and bay leaf.  Puree soup in blender.  [I
  always puree before adding whipping cream.]  Strain through sieve
  into medium saucepan. Season with salt and pepper.  Rewarm over low
  heat, adding more stock if thinner consistency is desired.  Add diced
  chicken and heat through. Serve immediately.
  
  Supposed to serve 4, but the way I make it, it makes about 8 servings.
  
  When reducing the stock/pepper mixture, I just cook it for one hour,
  even if it's not reduced to 4 cups (it's usually not).  At that
  point, I puree it in the blender, and *then* add the cream and cook
  for 40 minutes.  I find no need to strain the soup, as I peel my
  peppers scrupulously and puree the mixture well in the blender.
  
  You can also make this eliminating the chicken entirely, using just a
  rich chicken stock or vegetable stock.  If you use salted stock, use
  unsalted butter.

      Title: Smoked Salmon (Larry Lohkamp)
 Categories: Fruit, Herbs/spice, Bbq/grill
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/4 c  Pure salt
    1/2 c  Honey
      1 c  Soy sauce
      2    Garlic cloves, crushed
    1/2 sm Onion, crushed
    1/2 c  Red wine (cheap)
    1/2 ts Sweet basil
    1/4 ts Red pepper
      1    Salmon
 
  This pickle is the product of 2 years of testing.  The only problem
  with it is that you may not get to eat much of it.  I put 15 lbs of
  Coho salmon in the smoker last week and only have 2 lbs left.  It's
  amazing how many friends you have.
  
  Put salt in a 1 qt jar.  Warm honey so it will flow.  Put honey and
  soy sauce in a glass bowl and microwave on HIGH for 2 mins. Whisk
  until honey is dissolved, then pour into the jar.  Shake well to
  dissolve the salt. Add garlic, onion, wine, basil, and red pepper.
  Add cold water to make 1 qt of pickle.
  
  Fillet the salmon.  Scrape skin side with a knife under running water
  to remove slime.  Work quickly so that water doesn't degrade the
  meat.  Cut into chunks.
  
  Place the salmon skin side up in a glass container; do not use metal
  or plastic.  Cover with pickle and store in refrigerator. Pickle time
  is 8 hours per inch minimum.  The pickle is balanced so that longer
  times will not over-cure.
  
  Remove salmon from pickle and rinse quickly in cold water.  Allow
  salmon to drain and set up in refrigerator (skin side down) until
  surface is shiny and tacky to touch.
  
  Follow directions for your smoker.  For Little Chief model use 2 to 3
  pans of apple chips and hold in the smoker for about 12 hrs. If you
  freeze your smoked salmon, it will pick up water and soften when
  thawed.  It can be put back in the smoker for several hours to
  restore texture.

    1/2 c  Garlic - granulated
 
  by Chef John Folse. From
  : Pat Stockett, 02-09-94, 07:21 Originally From
  : Michelle Bass
  
  Cut pork butt into 1/2-inch thick strips.  Place on a baking pan and
  season with Worcestershire and Louisiana Gold sauces.  Once liquids
  are well blended into meat, add all remaining ingredients. Mix well
  into meat to ensure that each piece is well coated with the seasoning
  mixture. Cover with clear wrap and refrigerate overnight.
  
  Using a home style smoker, and using briquettes flavored with pecan
  wood and sugar cane strips if possible, smoke tasso at 175-200 F for
  2-1/2 hours. Once cooked, tasso may be frozen or used to season
  gumbos, vegetables, or a great pot of white or red beans.
  
  COMMENT FROM JOHN FOLSE:
  
  Tasso is yet another example of the Cajun and Creole desire for unique
  flavor in a recipe.  Tasso is a dried smoked product that is seasoned
  with cayenne pepper, garlic and salt and heavily smoked. The word
  tasso is believed to have come from the Spanish word "tasajo" which
  is dried, cured beef.  Although this delicacy is often thinly sliced
  and eaten alone, it is primarily used as a pungent seasoning for
  vegetables, gumbos and soups.
  
  Today in South Louisiana, tasso is becoming a popular seasoning for
  new and creative dishes.  It has also gained wide acclaim as an hors
  d'oeuvre served with dipping sauces or fruit glazes.
  
  At Lafitte's Landing Restaurant, we have incorporated tasso into our
  cream sauces and compound butters to create a new taste unheard of in
  classical cooking.  [Is great in pasta dishes, IMHO.] Source: "The
  Evolution of Cajun & Creole Cuisine"

  Halve and peel green pepper.
  
  Prepare the smoker as you would for any other roast.  Put the
  ingredients listed above in the water pan.
  
  To cook venison, it is important to remove the fat and membrane from
  the meat.  I stick a knife in the meat, then push some peeled cloves
  of garlic into the slit.  You can push whole fresh cayenne peppers
  and green onions in the slit also.
  
  After stuffing the slits you have made, sprinkle salt over the
  surface and pat in.  Do the same with red cayenne pepper.
  
  I would smoke the venison on the bottom rack and put a pork roast on
  the top rack of the smoker. That way it won't be so dry.

  Keep multiplying in these proportions until you got enough to do you.
  This is an excellent thing to do to a 10-lb-or-so whole brisket (_not_
  trimmed---you want the streak of fat in the middle to baste the meat
  as it cooks).  If you don't have a smoker where you can leave this on
  for about 10 or 12 hours, you can do it in the oven, running it at
  about 175 F for about 10 hours, and watching it occasionally
  (although I have, with success, put a brisket in the oven, gone to
  bed, and had it cook through the night for the next day's lunch).  Do
  this right, and you come out with a fine-tasting piece of meat.
  Wonderful for largish picnics and such.

 Categories: Bbq/grill
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/4 c  Salt
  1 1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
  1 1/2 ts Red pepper
 
  From : Michael Grosz, Oct-25-90 6:13am
  
  This unique recipe was given to me by Bill Lawrie of Dallas, based on
  using a regular meat smoker, capable of cooking at very low temps.
  Soak a couple handfuls of hickory or mesquite chips in water
  overnight. Lots of folks like to use a "rub". Here is one basic
  recipe:
  
  Rub the above into the meat to thoroughly coat. When the coals are
  ready, put some of the wood chips on the coals. Then put the meat on
  the grill and cover. Do not remove the cover - not even to "peek" at
  the meat during the smoking process. As mentioned earlier, it's
  important to have very low heat. After 4-5 hours, I either put more
  coals and chips on to cook it longer on the smoker, or I'll take it
  inside and wrap it tightly in two layers of foil, and put it in the
  oven for another several hours at about 190F. Which method you choose
  depends on your cooker and the level of smokiness you want. I suggest
  you start with a small piece of meat and continue that way until you
  get your own personal technique down pat. Here's another hint: To
  save some hassle, you can do 2 briskets at one time--when the
  briskets are ready to come off the fire and go into the foil, wrap
  them separately in foil. Put the 1 st one in the oven as per
  directions. When the 2 nd one has cooled down, put it in a Ziplok
  freezer bag and stash it in the freezer until you're ready for it.
  Then, take it straight from the freezer, remove the plastic bag, and
  pop it into the oven for several hours, just like you did the first
  one. I promise you: If you have wrapped it very tightly in foil, you
  will not be able to tell the difference between the 1 st and 2nd
  briskets.
  
  After it's done, it should have almost zero fat, except for maybe a
  layer on one side that you can peel off real easy like. Then start
  carving thin slices of that pretty little hunk of beef on the
  diagonal across the grain. It'll be so tender, it'll just melt in
  your mouth. Now, about sauce--here's one that'll make your taster
  dance for joy:
  
  4 tablespoons veg. oil (our original recipe called for 1/2 cup
  brisket fat, rendered, but that's not too good for the body, so we
  changed it to oil.) 1 1/4 cups ketchup 1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce 4
  tablespoons brown sugar juice of 2 lemons 2 tablespoons chopped onion
  1/4 cup water 1 tablespoon red pepper sauce
  
  Combine all ingredients in sauce pan and simmer over low heat,
  uncovered, 30 45 minutes. Mmmm-mmm. Now you're talking Texas bbq

  Canadian for mine.  It looks like a big pot on three legs with a
  domed top.
  
  A 15 pound turkey is about as big as will fit.
  
  In addition to the smoker you need:
  
  Unstuffed turkey Meat thermometer (optional)
  
  Something that makes fire to light the charcoal with.  The two sticks
  approach takes too long <grin>..  A Bic or equivalent will do nicely.
  
  There are two porcelin <--Spelling coated metal bowls inside the
  smoker. Fill the bottom bowl with charcoal and light it off.  In the
  meantime soak about two cups of wood chips in water for 20-30
  minutes.  When the charcoal is good and hot sprinkle about 1/2 of the
  would chips on the charcoal. Put 2 quarts of water, the rosemary and
  white wine in the top bowl. Put the grill on top and place your
  rinsed and salted turkey on the grill. Place the domed lid in place
  and your on your way.
  
  Check the charcoal and water once an hour making sure the charcoal
  stays hot and the water bowl is kept about 1/2 full.  Add additional
  wood chips every second hour. If your using a thermometer, cook until
  you reach the recommended poultry temperature, otherwise cook for
  about 1/2 per pound.

      Title: Pineapple in Port Wine
 Categories: Fruit, Alcohol
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 md Pineapple, cleaned (about
           -2-1/2 lbs)
           Finely pared zest of 1
           -orange
           Finely pared zest of 1/2
           -grapefruit
      4 tb Light brown sugar, or to
           -taste
    3/4 c  Pineapple juice
    1/2 c  Port
 
  This is a particularly good treatment for a pineapple that turns out
  not to be as sweet as it should be.  The better the port, the better
  the dessert. Make this dessert a day ahead for the best flavour.
  
  Peel, slice and core the pineapple and cut into 1 inch cubes or thin
  slices.  In pan, cook the zests, sugar and pineapple juice. Cook
  until the zests are tender, about 5 minutes.  While the liquid is
  still warm, add the pineapple pieces and stir in the port.
  Refrigerate for at least 8 hours, or overnight.  Allow to come up to
  room temperature before serving or flavours will be lost.
  
  VARIATION: Cut pineapple into tiny cubes.  Pour a little tequila over
  it just before serving.  Garnish with mint sprigs.  This Mexican idea
  for a hot weather dessert also work well as a first course.

      Title: Parsley Salad
 Categories: Salads, Herbs/spice
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 c  Fresh parsley (two bunches)
      4    Oil packed sun dried
           -tomatoes, drained and
           -sliced thin
    1/4 c  Freshly grated parmesan
           -cheese
    1/4 c  Extra virgin olive oil
      2 tb Fresh lemon juice
      2    Garlic cloves, pressed
           Copious amounts of pepper
           Salt to taste
 
  This refreshing salad is one of those California inspirations that
  seem to have been passed around from chef to chef, restaurant to
  restaurant. We think it may have originated at Cafe Beaujolais in
  Mendocino.  It is particularly good with a grilled main dish or an
  Italian style entree. For us, curly parsley works best in this dish,
  but others prefer the Italian flat leaf.  The most important thing is
  that the parsely is FRESH.
  
  Mix together the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, pepper and salt.
  Toss the parsley and tomatoes together.  Drizzle the dressing over
  and toss to coat. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese and serve immediately.

  From : Jim Bodle, Wed 07 Sep 94 02:54, Area: COOKING
  
  Here is my version of Michelle's smoked beans. It's really not as
  much work as it looks, but does take some time. It is well worth the
  effort, though. I took them to the family Labor Day picnic and there
  wasn't any left over. BTW, I used Bulls-Eye Original barbecue sauce
  because I was out of my own. I picked Bull-Eye because the ingredient
  list, didn't list any additives or preservatives. It's really a
  decent BBQ sauce.
  
  Wash beans and and soak in cold water overnight. Next morning, drain
  beans and rinse. Wash, peel and chop tomatoes. Add to beans and stir
  well. Add remaining ingredients, except bacon and stir well. Add
  enough water to cover beans to a depth of one inch. Bring to a full
  boil and boil for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat,
  simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 3-4 hours or until
  beans are tender. Tomatoes will cook apart and this is normal. It may
  be necessary to add some more water while simmering. Let cool a bit
  and pour into 3 foil lasagna pans. Cover with aluminum foil and
  refrigerate overnight.
  
  Next morning, uncover pans, lay 4 half strips of bacon on top of each
  pan. Place uncovered pans on racks in smoker. Smoke for 1 1/2 to 2
  hours, or until bacon is curling.
  
  Each pan serves 6-8.
  
  Note: This recipe was orignally, Michelle Bass's "Best Ever Baked
  Beans". Since we have plenty of tomatoes in the garden and we like
  tomatoes, I thought this would be a good use for some. It was! I
  froze one pan for later use, the rest was served at our family's
  Labor Day picnic. There wasn't any left to bring home. Thanks
  Michelle for the recipe. Thanks to Pat Stockett for preparing
  Michelle's recipe for the Cooking Echo picnic this year.

    I have several recipe translations for ardei. This is as close as I
  can get, and I know gram fried the rice in fat, then meat and
  whatever veggies were on hand. Thickened with a roux and add tomatoes
  and/ or sauce and simmered to desired consistency, slowly, about 40
  min. Adjust seasonings.
   This is literal- Wash and clean inside of peppers; mix ingredients in
  order given, except tomatoes and water. Stuff peppers with meat
  mixture, place in dutch oven or heavy pan with good cover and bake 40
  min with tomatoes and water added. Let simmer until meat is well
  cooked. Adjust heat down as it cooks, keeping right at simmer point.
    If sauce is too thin thicken again with roux and serve with chilled
  sour cream.

    Or they also work good with any fresh fish, filetted boneless, with
  a tartar(1/4ts cream of tartar, sweet pickle relish and mayo to
  taste) sauce on the side, or to get really gross I would use ground
  fresh chicken, beef or venison liverb braized in butter or bacon fat,

      1 x  Recipe
 
    Native stew is whatever meat you have on hand, beef, pork, lamb,
  veal or venison but must be lean cuts. Melt a couple tablespoons of
  fat or bacon grease in a skillet and fry chopped onions until golden
  brown. Dredge meat
  
  chunks in seasoned flour and add to skillet and cook stirring
  constantly until meat is browned. Add a couple of chopped ripe
  tomatoes and simmer slowly for 20 min or more, add diced boiled
  potatoes, adjust seasoning adding paprika and simmer till done. Serve
  hot topped with sour cream and minced fresh parsley.
    Most of the time the meats are cubed and thrown into a pot of ice
  cold water, washed once or twice and let stand in the same. May be
  thickened with a roux, as soaking meat adds water to recipe, but
  makes nice gravy. Submitted By MARK MIKLAS   On   07-28-95

      Title: Kathy Pitts' Guacamole
 Categories: Appetizers, Dips/spread, Relishes, Salsa/sauce, Tex/mexican
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      2    Ripe avocados
      2    Green onions, minced
      1 sm Tomato (preferably Roma),
           -seeded and minced
           Juice of 1 lime
      1    Jalapeno or serrano
           -pepper, seeded & minced
           Salt to taste
 
  This next recipe is for the closest thing you will find to a green
  salad in classic Mexican cooking.  Although many fresh vegetables are
  used in both Mexican and Tex-Mex dishes, they usually are
  incorporated in the dish, rather than served separately.
  
  Guacamole (Wahk-uh-MOLE-ay) is an avocado-based relish/sauce/salad
  that may be used as a garnish, accompaniment or first course (often
  in this role, accompanied by crisp-fried tortilla wedges for dipping).
  
  For a really elegant (and typically Mexican) presentation, serve the
  Guacamole in individual lettuce cups, garnished with a radish rose.
  
  Peel and seed the avocados.  Place one avocado in a bowl and mash
  until smooth.  Coarsely chop the second avocado and stir it in, along
  with the remaining ingredients.  Serve immediately if possible.
  
  NOTE:  Some cooks prefer to puree all the avocado.  For my taste, this
  makes the dish seem uncomfortably like baby food, but if you prefer it
  smooth, go for it.
  
  If this sauce is to be held for any length of time at all, return the
  avocado pits to the mixture (this helps prevent discoloration), and
  cover with plastic wrap, placed directly on the mixture, pressing
  down to eliminate all air.  Avocados discolor to a nasty brown if
  left exposed to the air.

      Title: Crisp Corn Flapjacks
 Categories: Pcake/waffl, Nuts/grains, Breakfast
      Yield: 5 servings
 
  1 1/3 c  White Cornmeal
  1 1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Baking Soda
    1/4 c  All-Purpose Flour
    1/4 c  Butter
      2 c  Buttermilk
      2    Eggs
 
  Most people mean "Pancakes" when they use the word "Flapjacks". There
  is a difference. "Flapjacks" are cornmeal pancakes, not wheat cakes.
  
  Preheat the griddle. Sift the flour. Place the cornmeal, salt, baking
  soda and flour in a bowl. Cut the butter in using a pastry blender.
  Combine the buttermilk and eggs and beat. Stir the liquid quickly
  into the sifted ingredients. Make the cakes small for easy turning.
  Beat the batter before each spoonful is placed on the griddle.

      Title: Jim's Yorkshire Pudding
 Categories: British isl, Meats, Breads, Puddings
      Yield: 12 servings
 
  1 3/4 c  Flour
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Milk; at room temp.
      4    Eggs; at room temp.
      1 c  Water; at room temp.
           Beef drippings or melted
           -Suet for the pan.
 
  Many Yorkshire pudding recipes in American cook books call for butter
  and all milk/no water; that's a Pop-over or something not a real
  Yorkshire Pud. This pudding needs no butter or fat in the batter as
  there is plenty of beef fat in the pan for flavor.
  
  The ingredients are so simple that the final product is a real
  surprise to first time cooks 'cause it's SO GOOD!
  
  It used to be the custom in England to cook the pudding in a tray
  under the roast and catch all the drippings. You get a tastier result
  from making small puddings in muffin trays in a hot oven after the
  roast is out as they puff up more and brown nicely.
  
  In olden days it was served before the roast which would be served
  with gravy covered potatoes AND bread to stretch out the meat.
  Today's diet conscious hosts would usually serve the puddings with
  the roast instead of potatoes and bread.
  
  N.B. The ingredients must be at room temp when mixed to maximize the
  puffing effect.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 F
  
  In a bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Make a well in the
  centre and pour in the milk. Stir. In another bowl beat the eggs
  until fluffy and then add the water. Beat this mixture into the
  batter until large bubbles form. [Let stand up to an hour if you need

  to brown.  Remove from the oven & let sit, loosely covered, for 10 to
  15 minutes.  Turn onto a serving plate & serve in slices.
  
  GRAVY:  Heat oil.  When hot, stir in the flour & let cook gently for
  30 seconds.  Add a dash of Worcestershire Sauce, followed by whatever
  vegetable stock you have on hand.  Add the herbs & bring to a boil.
  The amount of stock depends on how thick you want the gravy.  When it
  boils, reduce heat & let it simmer on very low heat for 5 minutes or
  so, to thicken.
  
  VARIATION:  Add about 1/4 c sliced mushrooms to the gravy when you
  add the stock.
  
  TO SERVE:  This goes very well with Greek style roasted potatoes, a
  green vegetable, such as asparagus or beans, & a vegan "Yorkshire"
  pudding. Ask for the reciupe if you want it.  It keeps well in the
  fridge (I've not tried freezing it) & is good served cold with a good
  vegetable soup, a baked potato, picalilli & green tomato chutney.

      3 c  Bread flour
    1/3 c  Oat bran (optional)
      1 ts Salt

  1 1/2 ts Cinnamon
      1 c  Carrot pulp from the juicer
           -(at room temp.)
      1 c  Tepid water
    3/4 c  Raisins, added at the "beep"
 
  Process on white bread setting. I prefer to start the machine with
  only part of the water added, then add the rest in a slow drizzle
  while it is running. That helps assure that I don't add too much
  water if the weather is humid or the pulp moister than usual.

           Bayleaf
           Pepper
 
  **  Finnan Haddies have a lovely subtle flavour ideal for this dish;
  other smoked haddock (or salmon), however, can be substituted if
  necessary.
  
  Place the fish in a large saucepan.  Cover with the milk. Add the
  bayleaf and pepper.  Bring to the boil. Reduce heat and simmer gently
  until the fish is cooked.  Carefully lift the fish with a slice,
  drain and place in a heated shallow serving dish; cover with foil and
  keep warm. Strain the fish milk into a jug.  Melt the butter in a
  saucepan. Stir in the flour and mustard.  Cook for 2 minutes. Add the
  fish milk. Bring to the boil, stirring continuously until it
  thickens. Remove from the heat. Stir in the cream. Reheat the sauce
  but do not boil. Pour over the fish. Serve with boiled potatoes and a
  fresh green vegetable. Serves 4.

      Title: Parlies  or Scottish Parliament Cakes
 Categories: Scot/irish, Cake/cookie
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      8 oz Flour
      4 oz Butter
      2 oz Caster sugar
      2 tb Golden syrup
           . *or* black treacle
      1 ts Ginger; ground
 
  Set oven to 350¯F or Mark 4.  Grease a baking tray. Cream together the
  butter and sugar in a mixing bowl. Add the flour, the egg and the
  syrup (together with the ginger, if required.) Beat well.
  Alternatively, put all the in gredients in a blender and mix well but
  ensure that they are at room temperature.  Drop dessertspoonfuls onto
  the baking tray leaving room for them to expand. Bake for 15-20
  minutes until light golden brown. Place on a wire rack to cool.
  
  Originally black treacle would have been used in this recipe.
  
  A delicious cross between a cake and a biscuit. (Remember that in
  Scotland a biscuit is what we in the New World call a cookie.)

  Unless the instructions that came with your ABM  call for putting the
  yeast in the pan first and incorporating the liquid ingredients last,
  pour the milk into the baking pan of your ABM and break in the egg.
  If the butter is not soft, cut it into small chunks to ensure its
  blending into the dough, then add it to the liquids.
  
  Next add the almond paste, slicced so it will blend better too.
  Measure in the flour, brown sugar, and salt, and add the yeast as
  directed for your bread maker.
  
  You can use your machine's full cycle with this bread, but the quick
  cycle is better. If a light color setting is available, use it as
  well.
  
  As soon as the bread has finished baking, remove it from the machine,
  closing the cover again, and ease the loaf from the pan. Combine the
  corn syrup and warm water and brush the top of the loaf with this
  mixture, using a pastry brush. Sprinkle the slivered almonds over the
  glaze, put the bread gently back in its pan, and return it to the
  electronic oven for a few minutes to dry the glaze a bit. FROM THE

      Title: Ham It Up!
 Categories: Bbq/grill
      Yield: 1 servings
 
MMMMM----------------FROM : DEREK MADDOX, FEB-26----------------------
           JP>BTW - I am looking for
           -some different ways to
           -prepare ham, possibly
           JP>smoked, candied,
           -barbecued or some such.
           -How do you folks do
           JP>it in the South?
           The absolute BEST way to
           -cook a ham is in a good
           -pit barbeque. One of
           Those new electric smokers
           -will do in a pinch.
           -There's just something
           About a ham slow-roasted
           -over hickory or oak coals
           -that makes my mouth
           Water just thinking about
           -it.  If you have a smoker
           -(one of the large,
           Barrel-shaped ones), you're
           -in luck.  Just remove the
           -skin from the ham,
           And put it in the smoker.
           -Place apple cider, with a
           -little cinnamon and
           Cloves, in the pan under
           -the ham.  If you like, put
           -1/4 to 1/3 cup good
           Tennessee whiskey in the
           -pan as well.  Let the ham
           -smoke for several hours
           (about 45 minutes per
           -pound).  The aroma will
           -drive you wild!
           If you don't have a smoker
           -or a good pit barbeque,
           -you'll have to make do
           With an oven.  I don't cook
           -hams in the oven often,
           -since we get tired of
           Eating the leftovers.  But
           -when I do, this is how I
           -do it.  Skin the ham,
           And place in a roasting pan
           -fat side up. Score the fat
           -in a diamond
           Pattern. Stick a whole
           -clove in the center of
           -each diamond.  Mix a bit of
 
  cinnamon in brown sugar (sorry, no exact measurements on this one),
  and pat the sugar mixture on top of the ham.  Bake in 325 deg F oven
  for about 25 minutes per pound of ham.  Baste the ham with apple
  cider every 30 minutes. Sorry that the recipes aren't exact, but I
  learned these from my father. After you do it a few times, you quit
  measuring things. By the way, serve sweet potatoes and fresh
  cornbread with the ham. Other vegetables are OK, but sweet potatoes
  are essential!

           As the Liquid Smoke I use
           -is very intense, it is
           -used in relatively small

MMMMM------------------QUANTITIES.  FOR EXAMPLE-----------------------
 
  A single teaspoon can be placed in the water pan/catch pan of an
  outdoor smoker (along with all of the herbs, onions, water, etc., to
  boost flavor and smokiness. A single teaspoon can be used to add an
  unusual flavor to about a gallon of pre-mixed Bloody Marys. Outdoor
  Smoker Pan Solution: 2 onions, halved 1 celery bottom (the root end
  that is normally thrown out) 1 Tablespoon dried thyme 6 garlic
  cloves, smashed 3 Tablespoons Angostura or Peychaud Bitters 1 to 2
  teaspoons Liquid Smoke Water to cover Place all ingredients in the
  water bowl of an outdoor smoker, before smoking your fowl, beef,
  pork, etc. The aromatic liquid left in the pan may be strained off,
  defatted somewhat, then used to make a very smokey gravy BASE for
  your cooked foods.

  I saw your tips on using roasted red bell peppers, Mary.  We love
  'em, too. We also like *smoked* red bell peppers.  You smoke them
  about 1-1/2 to 2 hours on a hot smoker with lots of hickory chips and
  then you can use them like the roasted ones or in a delicious soup,
  which I'll post for you in the next message.  We also use the roasted

      Title: Smoked Salmon (Earl Shelsby)
 Categories: Bbq/grill, Fish/seafoo
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           No Ingredients Found
 
  From : Earl Shelsby, Mon 13 Feb 95 00:00, Area: COOKING Here are some
  special hints for the processing of salmon. Never remove the skin from
  salmon.  Leave it on, whether the fish is processed whole, in halves,
  or in smaller cuts.
  
  For salmon, the blackstrap molasses variant of the Basic fish Brine
  gives particularly tasty results. Another delicious variant is to cut
  short the brining period by half an hour, and then marinate the fish
  in soy sauce for 30 minutes before drying and smoking. It is easy to
  produce what is sold commercially as Kippered Salmon.  This is made
  exactly the same way as ordinary smoked salmon except that after
  brining it is colored with a harmless dye, to give it the attractive
  reddish color. Some people put the dye in the brine; but then that
  batch of brine is spoiled for regular use. It is more economical to
  use in spearate dye bath. Kipper coloring is sold under various trade
  names, but the actual coloring ingredient is usually 150 Orange I, a
  dye approved under the U.S. Federal Food and Drug Cosmetic Act.  Half
  an ounce of the dye mixed with 2-1/2 U.S. gallons of water (2-1/8
  Imperial gallons) makes a suitable strength. Dip the fish for 15 to
  30 seconds, according to the depth of color desired. Ordinary food
  coloring may be used instead, but it does not give such a rich color.
  BASIC FISH BRINE: This brine is far superior to a straight salt
  solution and is recommended for use with fish, oysters, clams,
  shrimps and prawns. 4 U.S. gal water                  5 lbs salt (8
  cups) 1 lb dark brown sugar 1-1/2 cup lemon juice 2 tbs liquid garlic
  2 tbs liquid onion Disolve the salt first, then add the other
  ingredients and mix thoroughly. Test the brine with a potato or egg;
  the salinometer should read 80.  To be precise, of course, the
  salinometer is not now measuring the salt content of the brine, but
  shows the combined density change produced by all the flavoring
  ingredients. Concerning the Basic Fish Brine, here are some
  suggestions: If liquid garlic and liquid onion are not available,
  garlic and onion powder may be substituted, although they do not
  readily disolve in water. Alternatively, garlic cloves and onions may
  be crushed, but peel them first. To peel garlic easily, cut off the
  ends of the clove, put it on the cutting board and press with the
  side of a wide knife; the skin will pop off.  The garlic or onion may
  then be crushed with a garlic press.  Or, if no press is available,
  place the garlic or onion in a folded piece of aluminum foil or wax
  paper, and crush with a wide knife or piece of wood. If a stronger
  flavor is desired, add a little tabasco sauce to the brine. Dill may
  be added to the brine, for those who like it.  Two tablespoons of
  dill salt will be about right.  Alternatively, crushed of broken dill
  plants may be put in the brine, as they are put into dill pickles.
  The dill-flavored brine is particularly good for making smoked or
  kippered salmon. For a subtle variation of flavor, honey or
  blackstrap molasses may be substituted for the brown sugar.

      Title: Smokers - SL Info
 Categories: Bbq/grill, Information
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           No Ingredients Found
 
  Source: Southern Living Cookbook (electronic) Smokers, both charcoal
  and electric, are fast becoming one of the most popular cooking
  appliances. Long, slow cooking in a smoker with a self-basting water
  pan guarantees succulent meats and frees you to do other things.
  What's more, most people are delighted by distinctive flavors that
  result from smoking. Not just hickory, but apple and maple wood from
  your yard and herbs from your garden can all be used for rich, sweet
  flavoring of smoked foods. Part of the fun of smoking foods is
  experimenting with different flavorings. Leave space around each food
  item on the grill to allow even cooking and smoke penetration.  Don't
  open the smoker after everything is set, particularly during the
  first few hours. You'll lose both smoke and moisture, and prolong the
  cooking time required. Occasionally you may need to add more water to
  the pan during cooking. You'll hear a sizzling sound if the pan is
  empty, so don't lift the lid to check; simply pour water through the
  grill. Cooking times will vary with the outside temperature, cut of
  meat, quality of charcoal, and degree of doneness you desire. Color
  is not an accurate test for doneness.  Smoked pork and poultry are
  often pink even though they're thoroughly cooked. For large cuts of
  meat, it's best to use a meat thermometer to determine internal
  temperature and degree of doneness. Submitted By SALLIE KREBS   On

 Categories: Kids
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 c  White glue (Elmer's)
  1 1/2 c  Water
           Food coloring of choice
      1 ts Borax
    1/2 c  Water
 
  Mix the glue, 1 1/2 c water and food color until it's not sticky.
  Seperately dissolve the borax and 1/2 c water.  Add to the glue
  solution. You will get a very thick clump of Slime where the two mix.
  Now you must work in the rest of the solution.  With clean hands,
  knead the Slime to get it to mix.  This will take about 10 minutes or
  so, and is not very difficult as the Slime easily seperates between
  your fingers. If you desire a looser, more slimy texture, add a bit
  more water and knead it in. The more slimy this is, though, the more
  apt it is to get stuck in any fabric it comes in contact with.

      2 ts Black peppercorns
      2 ts Cumin seed
      4    Green cardamom pods --
           Crushed

      3 md Onion
      6    Cloves garlic -- chopped
      1 tb Ginger root -- chopped
      3 tb White wine vinegar

      2 ts Red pepper powder
      1 ts Ground tumeric
      3 tb Tamarind liquid
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  In a small skillet, dry roast the red chilies, peppercorns, cumin,
  cardamom and cloves until the cumin seeds begin to change color.  Let
  cool slightly. Grind to a powder in a spice grinder.  Chop one of the
  onions coarsely. Finely slice the remaining onions.  In a mini food
  processor or blender, process the garlic, ginger and 1 tbsp of water
  to a smooth paste. Add the chopped onion and 1 to 2 tbsp water, if
  necessary, and process again until smooth.  Add the ground spices and
  vinegar and process until thoroughly combined.  Put the pork in a
  shallow bowl.  Rub the paste mixture into the pork pieces. Cover and
  marinate for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator, stirring
  occasionally.  Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over moderate
  heat.  Add the crushed cinnamon.  Allow to cook for a few seconds.
  Add the reserved onion rings.  Cook, stirring for 2 minutes. Reduce
  the heat to low.  Add 2 to 3 tbsp water.  Cook, stirring ocasionally,
  until the onions are golden brown, about 20 minutes.  If necessary,

  seconds. Add the meat to the pan in batches and stir until it is
  seared on all sides, taking care the mixture does not stick to the

  hours.  Remove from heat. Serve with lots of rice and a yogurt salad.
  May be prepared 1 to 2 days ahead. Note-Skninless chicken, lamb or
  shrimp may be substituted. 359 calories and 11 grams fat.

      Title: Chicken In Fragrant Yogurt Sauce (Dahi Murgh)
 Categories: Indian, Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 ts White poppy seeds
      1 tb Olive oil
      3 c  Onion -- thinly sliced
      1 tb Ginger root -- chopped
      2 ts Garlic -- chopped
      1 ts Red pepper powder

      1 c  Plain yogurt
      6    Boneless skinless chicken
           Breast halves
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  In a small skillet dry roast the poppy seeds over moderate heat until
  aromatic.  Let cool.  Grind to a powder in a spice grinder or
  blender. Heat 2 tsp oil in a non-stick skillet.  Add the onions and
  stir for 2 minutes. Add 2 tbsp water.  Turn th heat to low.  Cook,
  stirring, until the onions are light brown, about 8 minutes.  Add the
  ginger and garlic and cook for another 2 minutes.  Add the red pepper
  powder, ground poppy seeds and 1 tbsp of the coriander leaves.  Stir
  for 30 seconds.  Let cool slightly. Put the mixture and 1/4 cup water
  in a food processor or blender and process to a smooth paste.  Add
  the yogurt and process long enough to blend. Do not overprocess.  Set
  aside.  Heat the remaining tsp of oil in a large nonstick skillet
  over moderate heat.  Add the chicken breasts and saute on each side
  until they are lightly browned.  Add the yogurt mixture and bring
  ALMOST to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the
  chicken is tender and no longer pink inside, about 8 to 10 minutes.
  Stir occasionally during cooking to make sure the sauce is not
  sticking to the pan and burning. The yogurt sauce should have
  thickened to a velvety, smooth consistency that just forms a glaze on
  the chicken. If the sauce is too thin, remove the cover and boil
  until the sauce reduces. If it is too thick, add skim milk tbsp by
  tbsp until the sauce is the correct consistency. Sprinkle remaining
  coriander leaves over the top. Flavors reach their full peak when
  prepared 1 to 2 days ahead. Reheat gently, adding skim milk if
  needed. 186 calories and 4 grams fat.

  total and permanent separation of throughputs to the maximum extent
  practicable under operating conditions.
  
  Position cookie sheet in a bake situation and surveil for 8 to 10
  minutes. Initiate coordination of outputs within the cooling rack
  function. Containerize, wrap in red tape and disseminate to
  authorized staff personnel on a timely and expeditious basis.
  
  Total Lead Time: 35 minutes.
  
  OUTPUT:
  
  Six dozen official government chocolate-chip cookie units.

      Title: Sesame Oil - Deliciously Nutty Oriental Fast Fixes
 Categories: Information
      Yield: 1 text
 
      4 ea Ideas for Sesame Oil
 
  If you've been saving this fragrant oil for Asian cuisine only,
  you'll be glad to know it's a great flavor booster for other dishes
  too -- just a few drops will do the trick.  To insure deep flavor,
  add right before serving.
  
  1) Make a quick dipping sauce for batter-fried vegetables: Combine
  1/2 cup chicken broth, 2 tablespoons sherry*, a chopped clove of
  garlic and a minced green onion; stir in a pinch of sugar and 4 drops
  of sesame oil.
  
  2) This is also nice brushed over kebabs of chicken fish, pineapple,
  green or red peppers.
  
  3) Enhance a simple soup of tortellini in chicken broth by sprinkling
  a few drops in each bowl.
  
  4) Zip up a hot fudge or butterschotch sundae by stirring a little
  sesame oil in prepared sauce before pouring over ice cream - then top
  with toasted sesame seeds for crunch.
  
  * teri's note: use dry sherry or, better, sake (rice wine - available
  at most stores that sell liquor)

      1 c  Chopped walnuts or pecans
 
  Tasks and Milestones: After procurement actions for the above required
  commodities, and subsequently identified appliances and
  instrumentalities, decontainerize materials. Perform succeeding
  measurement tasks sequentially.
  
  In a mixing bowl the incumbent will execute materials allocation for
  the brown sugar, the granulated sugar, the butter, and the shortening
  in an approved mixing container; order is precedential and
  unwaiverable. Incumbent will next impact the interfacement of eggs
  and vanilla, avoiding an overallocation scenario.
  
  To avoid at all cost being on the critical path, incumbent shall next
  perform materials loading of lour and soda into a bowl and aggregate.
  Equalize with prior mixture and develop intense and continous liaison
  among materials until minimum slack prevails. Assimilate key
  chocolate and nut subprojects and execut stirring operations.
  
  In a parallel task, an equally skilled and proficient incumbent will
  take actio to prepare the heating environment for throughput by
  manually setting the oven baking unit to a temperature of 350 degrees
  fahrenheit. When performed in a reasonable proficient manner, this
  will prevent a precedence relationship between the predecessor and
  successor creating a lag.
  
  Incumbent shall next allocate the aggregated materials in a dangling
  fashion from a teaspoon implement onto an ungreased cookie sheet at
  intervals sufficient to permit planned and actual separation of
  throughputs, thereby creating the maximum positive slack practicable
  under prevailing conditions.
  
  Position aforesaid cooking sheet into above conditioned oven
  instrument, in a bake or equivalent manufacturer recommended
  situation, and monitor for an earliest finish of eight minutes and an
  absolute finish of ten minutes baking aspect.  Incumbent is to
  initiate sequentially the coordination of baked materials within the
  cooling rack function, and subsequently to containerize when ambient
  condition is attained.
  
  Projected value:  3 dozen cookie units.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
           No Ingredients Found
 
  Ken Hom calls this 'fast food of great quality' which exactly fits our
  criteria.  It's a typical Hong Kong dish based on a classic Chinese
  cooking technique called 'velveting.'  it is the perfect description
  for the way the surface of an ingrdient looks and feels after it has
  been oil blanched, a variation of the more familiar water blanching.
  In Chinese cooking, oil blanching acts as a flavor sealer and keeps
  various flavors separate. It also equalizes cooking times in a stir
  fry of diverse ingredients. Serves 4-6.
  
  1 lb medium shrimp, peeled and deveined

  the peanut oil. Add the shrimp and stir to seperate. Turn off heat.
  Allow the shrimp to sit in the warm oil for about 2 minutes. Drain,
  saving the oil. Wipe wok clean and return about 1-1/2 tbsp of
  reserved oil. Quickly cook the ginger and scallions and then stir in
  the nut and salt and continue to stir fry for another 1/2 minute or
  so. Finally, return the shrimp to the wok, tossing with ginger and
  scallions. Stir fry for about 2 minutes and serve at once. Serve over

      Title: Pinch Pie
 Categories: Pie/tart
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           No Ingredients Found
 
  This terrific meringue tart shell has been resurrected from the "Joy
  of Cooking" - it's been dropped from later editions, probably thought
  to be too old fashioned.  It has a satisfying meringue crunch with a
  soft chewy interior.  It's just right for sliced sweetened fruit and
  whipped cream.
  
  SIFT:
  
  1 cup sugar
  
  PLACE ON A PLATTER:
  
  3 egg whites
  1/2 tsp baking powder
  1/8 tsp salt
  
  COMBINE IN A SMALL CUP:
  
  1 tsp vanilla
  1 tsp vinegar
  1 tsp water
  
  Whip the egg whites by hand until they are very stiff.  Add the sifted
  sugar very slowly, 1/2 tsp at a time, alternately with a few drops of
  the combine liquids.  Beat constantly.  When all the ingredients have
  been added, continue to beat the meringue for sseveral more minutes.
  (Can also be done with an electric mixer, but beat all ingredient
  together except the sugar.  Using high speed, slowly add sugar
  tbspfuls at a time.) Heap on a lightly greased platter and shape with
  spatula.  Bake in a 275F oven for about an hour or longer.  When
  ready to serve, fill the center with fresh sliced fruit and top with
  whipped cream. Origin: Great Food Without Fuss. Shared by: Sharon

           Pepper)
  1 1/2 tb Chopped fresh basil leaves
      1 ts Chopped fresh thyme leaves
      1 ts Chopped fresh rosemary
           Leaves
      1    11.5 oz can V-8 juice
    1/4 c  Fat-free chicken stock
    1/4 ts White pepper
           HERBED COUSCOUS:
  1 1/2 c  Fat-free chicken stock
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1    Bay leaf
      1 ts Chopped fresh thyme leaves
    1/2 ts Chopped fresh rosemary
           Leaves
      1 ts Olive oil
      1 c  Couscous
           SWORDFISH:
  1 1/2 lb Fresh swordfish (4 6-oz
           Pieces)
           Sprigs of fresh thyme or
           Rosemary, for garnish (opt.)
 
  To make the vegetable minestrone, heat the oil in a large saucepan
  over medium heat.  Add the garlic and cook just until it starts to
  sizzle; do not brown.  Add the herbs, juice, stock and peper and
  bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 3 minutes.  Set
  aside.
  
  To make the couscous, combine the stock, pepper, herbs and oil in a
  small saucepan and bring to a boil.  Add the couscous, mix well and
  remove from the heat.  Cover tightly and allow to stand for at least
  5 minutes, or until all of the liquid has been absorbed.  Set aside.
  
  Wash the swordfish and pat it dry.  Rub the surface with a little
  olive oil and sprinkle with salt, freshly ground black pepper and
  herbs, if desired. Cook over a charcoal grill or under a broiler just
  until it turns from translucent to opaque, about 3 to 4 minutes per
  side.  Do not overcook or the fish will become tough.
  
  To serve, place a rounded 1/2 cup of couscous on each of 4 plates and
  top with a piece of grilled swordfish.  Spoon the minestrone around
  each serving, dividing it equally.  Garnish each serving with a sprig
  of fresh thyme or rosemary, if desired.

    1/4 c  Chicken Broth
    1/4 c  Water
    1/4 c  Dry Sherry Wine
 
  Quoting from the article the recipe was contained in, "The dish is not
  difficult to make and can be prepared partially in advance. The crunch
  texture of the chicken pieces is achieved by coating them with egg and
  cornstarch, then deep-frying them twice; once to cook them through;
  and once at a higher temperature to make them brown and crisp. The
  velvety sweet-sour sauce, which is combined with the chicken at the
  last minute, provides a wonderful counterpoint. The amount of heat is
  your option. Sixteen small dried red peppers provide a moderate
  amount of heat. Add more or less to taste, but be careful not to bite
  into one. They are dynamite!" Whisk together thoroughly the egg and
  cornstarch. Add pieces of chicken, turning to coat evenly.  In wok or
  deep-fat fryer, heat 2 inches of oil to 350F.  Fry chicken, a few
  pieces at a time until lightly browned and just cooked through.
  Drain on paper towels. Combine sauce ingredients, mixing well.  Set
  aside. (The chicken may be fried the first time up to one hour in
  advance; the sauce can be combined several days in advance and kept
  covered in the refrigerator.) In frying pan, heat 1 TB of oil until
  hot. Add chili peppers and cook until blackened.  Add onions and
  stir-fry about one minute. Add garlic and ginger, cooking briefly,
  but do not brown. Remove from heat. Reheat deep oil to 400F.  Return
  chicken to fat, in batches, and cook until crisp and golden brown.
  Drain on paper towels. Re-stir sauce and add to frying pan with
  onions and peppers. Cook, stirring until thickened and bubbly.  Add
  chicken and cook, stirring, until well coated and heated through.
  Serve over rice. Makes 3 to 4 servings.

 Categories: Italian, Soup/stew, Herbs/spice
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3    Heads garlic - fresh
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      1 md Onion - cut up
      2    Celery ribs - cut up
      1 c  White wine - dry
    1/4 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ga Chicken stock
      1 md Potato - peeled and cut up
      1 c  Whipping cream
     10    Basil leaves - fresh,
           -chopped
      5    Sprigs thyme leaves - fresh
      2 ts Salt
      1 ts White pepper
    1/2 ts Tabasco
      1 ts Extra virgin olive oil
      2    Garlic cloves - sliced very
           -thin, for garnish
 
  *My notes: This recipe may sound strange... but it's *wonderful*!
  
  1.  Cut two of the garlic heads in half across and remove the papery
  outer skin.  Put these cut side down on a very hot surface - a
  griddle or black iron skillet - until they're black.  Peel all the
  garlic completely.
  
  2.  Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan and saute the onions,
  celery, and the garlic until lightly browned at the edges. Add the
  wine and bring to a boil.
  
  3.  Sprinkle in the flour and stir the pot thoroughly, but don't let
  it brown.  Add the chicken stock, 1/2 gallon water, and the potato.
  Whisk about the pot well and bring to a boil. Reduce to a rapid
  simmer and cook for about an hour and 15 minutes.
  
  4.  Strain out the solids from the soup, and puree them in a blender
  or food processor, along with enough broth to ease things along.
  Return the puree to the soup and restore the boil. Add the whipping
  cream, basil, thyme, salt, pepper and Tabasco.
  
  5.  Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a skillet very hot.  In it
  toast the slivers of garlic until brown around the outside.
  
  6.  Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with roasted garlic slivers.
  Float a toasted, garlic-buttered slice of French bread on top.
  
  Chef Andrea Apuzzo writes of this recipe in his book "La Cucina di
  Andrea's", "Garlic wears many hats.  Most people think of it in its
  aggressive, green, aromatic, sharp form.  But when garlic is cooked
  slowly for a long time, it takes on a sweet nuttiness that is every
  bit as interesting as its more raw flavors.  The sweet side of garlic
  is exemplified by this soup."

      1    Turkey - 8 to 10 pounds
      1 md Onion
      2    Bay leaves
    1/2 c  White wine
           Super Smoking Sauce - (see
           -recipe)
 
  From : Fred Towner, Sun 16 Oct 94 14:12, Area: COOKING
  
  Rinse turkey, pat dry and rub liberally with oil (we'd rub it with
  Liquid Smoke instead). Place onion, bay leaves and wine in water pan
  with hot water (we'd add a few sticks of celery and a few cloves of
  garlic).  Place water pan in smoker and turkey on grid (it won't hurt
  to put a quartered onion, a few stalks of celery and a bay leaf
  inside the turkey; we also sometimes mix freshly ground black pepper,
  a bit of salt and some crushed thyme together and after loosening the
  breast skin with your hands, push this mix up under the skin and
  spread over the breast of the turkey).
  
  Place dome on smoker and do not remove until midway through cooking
  time. Then remove dome and liberally paint turkey with Super Smoking
  Sauce. Replace dome and continue smoking.  When turkey is done,
  liberally paint again and allow to smoke for 15 minutes more. Yield:
  8 to 10 servings.
  
  Charcoal:  Use 10 pounds charcoal, 5 quarts hot water, 3 wood sticks
  (we use about 5 to 8 presoaked wood blocks) and smoke 4 to 6 hours.
  Electric: Use 4 quarts hot water, 3 wood sticks and smoke 4 to 6
  hours.
  
  Add water to water pan after about 4 hours or as needed (you can tell
  when smoker needs water by the sizzling sound it will make).

      1 tb Prepard mustard
 
  From : Dan Perez, Jun-23-90 0:32am
  
  juice of one and one-half limes two or three dashes of tabasco sauce
  
  To get started, place a handful of hickory or mesquite chips into cold
  water and set aside.  Parboil rib sections in boiling water for about
  ten minutes (this partially cooks them and renders much of the fat).
  Remove rib sections and set on wire rack to cool.  Combine dry
  ingredients in a bowl and blend well with a fork.  When rib sections
  are cool, rub the dry ingredient mixture into the meat.  Stack rib
  sections, seal in aluminum foil and let them sit in the refrigerator
  for about two hours.
  
  After two hours, start the coals in your smoker.  Combine ingredients
  for basting sauce in a blender and blend until smooth.  Transfer the
  basting sauce to a saucepan and heat over low heat until it begins to
  bubble.  If you prefer for the basting sauce to be thicker, mix 2
  tablespoons of cornstarch with 1/4 cup of cold water, and mix a
  little of the cornstarch mixture into the basting sauce a bit at a
  time to until desired consistency is achieved.
  
  When the coals are uniform gray, scatter a few of the wet wood chips
  over them.  Rub grill with a paper towel dipped in vegetable oil.
  Brush ribs with basting sauce and place them on the grill.  Cover
  with smoker lid (leave vents about half-open).  Grill the ribs for
  about an hour, turning about every fifteen minutes and basting as you
  turn them.  Add wood chips to the coals as necessary to maintain
  smoke.
  
  Serve ribs with warm basting sauce.

      Title: Ribs, Cuts & More
 Categories: Bbq/grill, Meats, Information
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2    Hours for the country style.
 
  From : Joe Ferenchik, Wed 14 Dec 94 10:54, Area: COOKING
  
  Here's some rib info for you.
  
  Available cuts......
  
  Pork Back Ribs: Cut from the blade and center section of the pork
  loin, these contain rib bones and the finger meat between the ribs.
  One pound for one hungry person.
  
  Spareribs: These come from the side of the hog. A full slab should
  have about 13 ribs. Although they have the least meat they are
  considered by most to have the most flavor. As above one pound for
  one hungry person.
  
  Country style: Absolutely the meatiest cut, it comes from the rib end
  of the loin. For these figure about one half pound per hungry
  appetite.
  
  Boneless: Pork loin or boneless chop cut into strips.
  
  How your ribs taste has everything to do with the way that they are
  cooked. For the tastiest ribs cook them slooooow.
  
  Grilled: My favorite, I cook wrapped in foil with a rub and about the
  last half hour I remove the foil get a flame going to slightly char
  the meat. After this slight charring to add that grilled look and
  flavor I put on the sauce, turning twice and re-applying the sauce
  with each turn. I also close ALL the vent's to assure that the sauce
  bakes on properly and doesn't burn. Cooking time varies with the cut
  from about 1.25 hours for spareribs to 2 hours for the country style.
  
  Oven roasted: Roast uncovered for about 1 hour for the spareribs to
  about
  
  Smoked: To get that smoked flavor use hickory or a favorite smoking
  wood of yours, following the cooking recommendations of your
  particular smoker. You can also impart that smoked flavor by cheating
  and simmering for about 1 hour for the country style in a combination
  of liquid smoke and water. Use 1 part liquid smoke to 10 parts water.
  Then refrigerate or freeze the ribs until ready to cook. Finish off
  with your desired method of cooking.
  
  You can also par boil the ribs slightly and the meat most assuredly
  will fall from the bone when they're finished.
  
  Rubs: The application of dry herbs and spices before cooking.
  Favorites are lemon, dill mustard, and pepper. My absolute favorite
  is a blend of spices that goes by the trade name of "WITT'S" for
  prime rib and roast beef.
  
  Marinades: Always include an acidic ingredient such as vinegar or
  citrus juice. Add oil and spices for that extra flavor and
  refrigerate overnite. Never marinate in a sugar or tomato based sauce
  as this will most assuredly buy during the cooking process. Marinate
  for no more than 24 hours and turn at the 12 hour mark. Try
  marinating in orange juice, it's rather expensive since any leftover
  juice must be discarded after basting but the taste is just glorious.
  
  Remember to put your sauce on at the end of the cooking process to
  avoid charring.
  
  Here are some tips for better ribs.
  
  1.)Cook slowly, the slower the better for those tender juicy results.
  
  2.)Be slow to sauce.......Your choice of sauce should NEVER be applied
  before that last half hour mark.
  
  3.)Never marinate in a tomato or sugar based sauce.
  
  4.)Don't marinate for more than 24 hours. If it isn't ready by then
  it's never gonna' be ready.
  
  5.)Try some dry rubs. I always put on a rub for my ribs no matter
  where they're gonna' be cooked.
  
  6.)Experiment with different things. The fast food joint is only up
  the street. Remember my famous saying..... "The only difference
  between a good cook and a bad cook is that a good cook has had many
  more bad meals." We all have to learn by doing so get creative and
  try the impossible. It may be unpalatable or it may be a culinary
  delight. Try peppermint ice cream with Hershey's syrup and cover all
  with fresh sliced strawberries. It may sound terrible but what a
  flavor explosion!
  
  The next post will have some different sauces to apply to the ribs
  when they're "just about there". Do what I did and develop your own
  signature sauce that says "You" made these ribs. At the big family
  gatherings there is absolutely no doubt in anyone's mind when
  confronted with dishes of ribs to choose from as to the ones that
  "Joe" made. Most can tell just from the smell. Personally I use the
  same sauce for my ribs EVERY time. It's a concoction I "threw"
  together and it turned out to be a "hit". It's the only secret that
  I've kept from my wife. We've been together 19 years and she still
  doesn't know all that's in it. Ok Ok I'll tell ya one of my "secret"
  ingredients......cinnamon.
  
  7.)Know your cuts and learn to appreciate the subtle differences of
  them all.
  
  8.)Ribs are a simple dish and meant to be savored with your fingers.
  Keep your side dishes simple. Favorites include cole slaw, bbq'd
  beans, potato salad, jello salad, corn bread, homemade biscuits, and
  any grilled veggies.
  
  9.)Get sloppy, it's no fun if you're not wearing some of the sauce.

  indirect heat.  Keep grill covered.  Then turn and cook 15 min on the
  other side. Then turn them over again for 15 min....cooking till the
  ribs pull apart easily.  This will be about 2 1/2 hours at 225
  degrees. (Use a thermometer to maintain tempurature adding coals as
  needed.)
  
  Combine all of the sauce ingredients.  Heat and serve with the meat.

  Perhaps the most famous fake is mock apple pie, popularized by the
  makers of Ritz Crackers in the 1940's.  The pie uses absolutely no
  apples. Instead of fruit, the filling is nothing more than candied
  cracker crumbs with just enough lemon juice and cinnamon to hint of
  Mom's real thing. Preheat oven to 425F.  Roll out half of the pastry
  and fit it into a 9-inch pan. Break the crackers coarsely into the
  pastry lined pan. Combine the water, sugars and cream of tartar in
  saucepan; boil gently for 15 minutes. Add lemon juice and rind., and
  let cool.  Pour the mixture over the crackers. Dot with butter and
  sprinkle with cinnamon. Roll out the remaining pastry and cover the
  cracker mixture. Trim and flute edges. Cut slits in top crust to let
  steam escape. Place in oven and bake for 30 - 35 minutes or until

 Categories: Dips/spread
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      4    Calves' feet
      3 qt Water
           Whites of 2 eggs
    1/2 lb Powdered sugar

  Clean the feet thoroughly and boil them slowly until the three quarts
  of water are reduced to one.  Strain and set away until cold. Remove
  the grease and place the jelly in a saucepan, being careful to avoid
  the settlings.  Add the sugar, lemon juice and whites of eggs; let
  all boil together for a few minutes.  Pour into bowls or glasses and
  set away to cool.  This is much more nourishing than the commercial

      Title: Sesame Chicken Salad
 Categories: Chinese, Salads, Poultry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 tb Sesame seeds
      3    Whole chicken breasts
      6 c  Water
      2 tb Soy sauce
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Fivespice powder
      3    Stalks celery
      1 tb Sesame oil
      1 tb Vegetable oil
    1/4 ts Ground ginger
    1/8 ts Pepper
 
  This is a bit more substantial than what one usually thinks of when
  dealing with Chinese Chicken Salad. The chicken breasts are cooked in
  the Chinese manner by boiling and then steeping off the heat. This
  gives chicken that is cooked but extremely juicy and tender.
  
  1. Sprinkle sesame seeds into small, shallow baking pan or cookie
  sheet with sides. Bake in preheated 350 degrees F (180 C) oven until
  golden, 5 to 8 minutes.
  
  2. Combine chicken, water, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of the soy sauce, the
  salt and fivespice powder in 3 or 4-quart (3 or 4 L) sauce- pan.
  Cover and cook over high heat until water boils. Reduce heat and
  simmer 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Let chicken stand in water
  1 hour.
  
  3. Remove chicken from water (reserve water) and drain. Remove and
  discard chicken bones. Cut meat into 1/2-inch (1.5 cm) wide slices.
  
  4. Cut celery into diagonal slices. Heat reserved water over high heat
  until it boils. Add celery and cook until crisp-tender, 1 to 2
  minutes. Drain celery well.
  
  5. Combine remaining 1 tablespoon (15 mL) soy sauce with oils, ginger
  and pepper in large bowl. Add chicken and celery. Toss until
  completely combined. Transfer mixture to serving dish. Sprinkle with
  sesame seeds.

      Title: Acorn Squash and Wild Rice
 Categories: Vegetables, Pasta/rice
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2    Acorn squash, ~1-1/2 lb ea
    1/2 lb Small Brussels sprouts
      2 ts Olive oil
      1 c  Diced onion
      1 ts Fennel seeds
      1 ts Dried marjoram
    1/4 c  Minced fresh sage
    1/4 c  Fresh orange juice
      2 ts Fresh lemon juice
    1/8 ts Freshly grated pepper
      2 c  Cooked wild rice
 
  1.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F).
  
  2.  Cut each squash in half and remove the seeds and pulp.  In a large
  baking dish, place the squash, cut side down, with about 1 inch of
  water. Bake until tender, about 45 minutes.
  
  3.  Pour about 2 inches of water into a large stockpot.  Place a
  collapsible steamer in the pot, cover, and bring to a boil.  Place the
  Brussels sprouts in the steamer, cover, and steam for 5 to 7 minutes,
  or until tender.  Set aside.
  
  4.  Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat the oil over low heat.  Add
  the onion and saute for 10 minutes, stirring frequently.  Stir in the
  fennel, marjoram, sage, orange juice, lemon juice, and pepper, and
  simmer for 3 minutes.  Stir in the cooked wild rice and the Brussels
  sprouts and heat through.
  
  5.  Spoon the wild rice and Brussels sprout mixture into the squash
  cavities.  Serve immediately.
  
  I often microwave the acorn squash by placing in a shallow glass pan
  with about 1/2-inch of water, covering with saran wrap and nuking for
  about 10 minutes or until tender.

      Title: Raspberry-Lemon Verbena Butter
 Categories: Dips/spread, Fruit, Herbs/spice
      Yield: 1 batch
 
    1/2 lb Unsalted butter
      4 oz Fresh or frozen raspberries
           -- not in syrup
      1 tb Sugar; or to taste
      1 sm Handful young, tender lemon
           -- verbena leaves
 
  Thaw raspberries if frozen, and pour off any excess liquid.
  
  With all ingredients at room temperature, blend butter, sugar and
  raspberries until smooth.  This may take a while (about three minutes
  in a food processor), and you may think it's never going to emulsify,
  but it will if you persist.  Strip out any large veins in the lemon
  verbena leaves, then add the leaves (chopped if you're mixing by
  hand) and blend until the texture is pleasing.
  
  Alley notes that "this delightfully sweet and fragrant butter is
  excellent on muffins, pancakes or waffles."

      Title: Caesar Salad (Complete) (2 of 2)
 Categories: Salads, Fish/seafoo
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Continued from Caesar Salad
           Complete (1 of 2)
 
  CROUTONS:
  
  For very fresh, absorbent croutons make your own from ordinary white
  sliced bread. I use one slice per person. First, put the bread slices
  in the freezer (wrapped in plastic) until the slices are firm. With a
  sharp knife, cut off the crusts and feed the pieces to the birds. Cut
  the rest of the bread into roughly 1/2-inch cubes. Placecubes in a
  single layer on a cookie sheet and bake at about 250 degrees to dry
  them out. Sti the cubes around once or twice. Remove them from the
  oven when they are a very light tan color (usually 30 to 45 minutes).
  Croutons will stay fresh for several days in a closed refrigerated
  container.
  
  SUBSTITUTIONS:
  
  The most spectacular salad contains all fresh ingredients. However,
  if you need to simplify the procedure, here are some recommendations
  for substitutions. Use a few tablespoons of lemon juice in place of a
  freshly squeezed lemon. In place of the garlic cloves you could
  sprinkle garlic powder (but not garlic salt!) into the bowl. You can
  try commercially prepared grated Parmesan cheese, but freshly grated
  Parmesan is sweeter and has a better texture. (Commercial grated
  cheese often contains cellulose to prevent caking. If it does, it
  will taste just like a cardboard box.) Ordinary head lettuce instead
  of romaine might do in an emergency, but it's not for guests. Anchovy
  paste in place of flat fillets is not a very good substitute. Never
  use anything but pure olive oil.
  
  TECHNIQUE: Part of the enjoyment of a Caesar salad is watching the
  chef create it at the table. Prepare all of the ingredients ahead of
  time and arrange them in saucers and bowls on a small table next to
  the dining table. Be sure to include a stack of dinner plates and a
  small bowl for discarding the egg shells. Do everything with a
  flourish and occasionally tip the bowl allowing your guests to watch
  (and sniff) your progress.

      Title: Mango Tango
 Categories: Fruit
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           MANGO TANGO
           ===========
 
  Mountains of green, yellow and red-tinged footballs tumble from boxes
  in every corner store. Sweet as summer, dripping with juice, the best
  place to enjoy them is in the bathtub. They're so cheap right now,
  buy a bunch. Mango master Sal Borg of Sanci Tropical Foods in
  Kensington Market say he might have 12 varieties on hand any given
  day from now to September. Most hail from Mexico and Jamaica. Some
  mangos are fibrous inside, others smooth as silk. Haden, Tommy
  Atkins, Keitt and Kent are the most common in these parts. India's
  Alphonse mango is queen of the spring crop, while the most revered
  mid-summer mango is the Imperial. "If you can find an Imperial," says
  Borg, "you'll be in mango heaven." Each variety has its own tropical
  taste, so experiment. You'll find the name on the box, or ask your
  produce manager. To pick a mango, look for taut skin and a sweet
  smell. Leave on the counter until slightly soft when pressed, then
  refrigerate until use. Puree ripe mangoes into milkshakes, slice over
  ice cream or cube and gently fold (at the last minute) into fruit or
  chicken salad. Or chop for salsa. Thai cooks garte hard, unripe
  mangoes into tart salads, and serve ripe mango slices with sticky
  rice and coconut milk for breakfast. But the best way to eat mango is
  to stand over the sink and eat the whole thing. As golden juice runs
  down your arm, close your eyes and think summer sunshine all year
  round.
  
  HOW TO PEEL A MANGO: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  1. Place unpeeled mango upright with narrow end toward you. With a
  sharp knife, slice gently down one "cheek" following the line of the
  pit. DON'T SLICE INTO THE PIT! Repeat with second cheek. Cut
  remaining flesh in strips and peel.
  
  2. Score each cheek deeply in a cross-hatch pattern, cutting down to
  but not through the skin. Cut large squares for fruit salad; small
  squares for salsa.
  
  3. Push cheeks skin-side up and inside out so the fruit pops up like a
  porcupine. With knife, cut cubes from peel and use in recipes. Or
  serve cut mango halves for breakfast or dessert. Recipes to folow in
  subsequent messages.

      1 ea Pt catsup
    1/3 c  Flour
      4 ts Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Black pepper
      1 tb Prepared mustard
      1 c  Worcestershire sauce
      1 ea Part black pepper
      3 ea Parts salt
  1 1/2 ea Pt water
      1 tb Salt
  2 1/2 ts Paprika
  1 1/2 ts Chili powder
  1 1/2 ts Liquid Smoke
 
  Season the slab of pork ribs on both sides with the above mixture.
  Place ribs on the grill in any type of covered smoker or barbecue
  pit, keeping away from direct heat so that the smoke does the
  cooking. Cook very slowly for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until meat comes
  away from the bone easily. During the final 15 minutes of cooking,
  baste both sides of the meat with barbecue sauce. Cut ribs to serve.
  To make sauce, combine catsup and water in large pot. Bring to a
  boil. Mix dry ingredients together. Add mustard, Liquid Smoke, and
  half of the Worcestershire sauce. Stir into a paste; then add
  remainder of Worcestershire sauce. Pour this into heated mixture and
  boil slowly for 20 minutes. Refrigerate any unused portion. Keeps for
  several weeks. Sauce makes about one quart.

   Lay the dumplings on a flat surface, crimped edges up, to form a flat
  bottom. Repeat with remaining filling and wrappers.
   If making ahead, at this point the pot stickers my be placed on a
  baking sheet, covered lightly and frozen. When frozen, pack in
  airtight packaging and freeze up to 6 monthes. When ready to serve,
  just proceed with the recipe, no thawing is necessary.
  
  TO COOK THE POT STICKERS Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a 12 inch
  heavy skillet over medium high heat. Add as many pot stickers as you
  cn get in the pan without crowding; cook until golden brown on the
  bottom.
   Add 1/2 cup broth and cover the pan immediately. (Be careful, A major
  amount of splattering and sizzling occurs as soon as the broth comes
  in contact with the oil.) Reduce the heat to medium low; cook the
  dumplings until most of the liquid has been absorbed and the pot
  stickers are nicely plumped and a deep golden brown on the bottom.
   Remove from the heat and keep them warm in a 200 degree F oven while
  you use the remaining oil and broth to cook the remaining pot
  stickers in the same manner.
   To serve, provide guests with individual small dishes containing hot
  chile oil and the Sesame Soy Dipping Sauce.
  
  TO MAKE YOUR OWN HOT CHILE OIL Saute 2 teaspoons of dried red chile
  flakes in 1/2 cup of peanut oil for 3 minutes. Remove from heat and
  let stand until cool. If desired, stir in 1 tablesppon prepared chile
  garlic sauce.
  
  SESAME SOY DIPPING SAUCE In a small container, combine soy sauce,
  vinegar, garlic, ginger and oil.
   Makes about 2/3 cup.

      Title: Bagels History
 Categories: Information
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           BAGELS HISTORY
           ==============
 
  The Bagel, the roll with a hole, is golden brown and crusty on the
  outside, soft and tender on the inside. Bagels are low in calories,
  270 calories per 3 ounce bagel. The first bagel rolled into the world
  in 1683 when a local baker wanted to pay tribute to Jan Sovretsky,
  the King of Poland. King Janhad just saved the people of Austria from
  an onslaught of Turkish invaders. The King was a great horseman, and
  the baker decided to shape the yeast dough into an uneven circle
  resembling a stirrup. The Austrian word for "Stirrup" is beugel. In
  Poland bagels are officially sanctioned as an appropriate gift for
  any woman in childbirth. BAGEL TIPS: FREEZING: After buying your
  fresh bagels, you can slice them and place them in a plastic freezer
  bag. You can hold them for months,and when ready, go directly into
  the toaster. REJUVENATING: If your bagels are several days old and
  you did not have them in the freezer, you may freshen them up by
  toasting orputting them in an oven for a few minutes. STORING: When
  storing bagels, make sure they are cooled before putting in a plastic
  bag, or they may sweat and become soggy. MAKING BAGEL CHIPS: Slice
  bagels into very thin rings. Arrange "chips" in a single layer on
  ungreased baking sheet. Bake until"chips" are browned and crisp. If
  desired, sprinkle with garlicsalt, plain salt, onion salt, or
  parmesan cheese during the last few minutes of baking time. Ann
  Landers On Bagel Safety: HOW TO PROPERLY SLICE A BAGEL
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The following appeared in Ann Landers'
  June 11, 1995 column: Dear Readers: Would you believe that the
  greatest under-reported injury of our time is hand cuts from slicing
  bagels? The authority for this is Mark Smith, head of George
  Washington Hospital's Department of Emergency Medicine in the
  nation's capital.Smith has an explanation for all those folks who
  come in, often in their pajamas, with blood dripping from their
  wounds. He says, "The bagel is inherently unstable because it is
  round. In fact, there are two unstable surfaces - the knife against
  the bagel and the bagel against the table."Never stand a bagel on end
  and try to slice it. It is equally dangerous to hold the bagel in
  your hand and attempt to cut it in half. The safe way is this: Place
  the bagel flat on a hard and stable surface. Put the hand NOT doing
  the cutting on top, to steady it. Take a sharp knife and cut halfway
  down the bagel, slicing horizontally, until you are at least halfway
  through. Then, place the bagel on end, and finish slicing it in half
  * This information came from L.A. Wilson, who signed himself, "A
  Buffalo Bagel Lover." So, thank you, Mr. Wilson, from Ann Landers, a
  Chicago bagel lover.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
           FOOLPROOF CHILI RECIPE
           ======================

MMMMM----------------COUCH POTATO GRUB: MAKING CH---------------------
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
           -~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
  One of the few great examples of cooking that takes no skill
  whatsoever. And here's a recipe to prove it CHILI CON CARNE
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Consider the scene: It's a Football Sunday, the
  noblest and most beloved day of the True Couch Potato's week. A bunch
  of fellow spuds are dropping by for some chips 'n dips, brewskis 'n
  nuts, and that finest of Couch Potato feeds, a grand pot of chili,
  which you are in charge of, and which you are trying to turbocharge
  to unforgettable proportions. You want to make a chili that will
  cause the paint to peel, that will lead to a number of marriages
  coming to an end. The Chili to End All Chilies. And so, in classic
  low-maintenance Couch Potato style, you do the right thing ++ you go
  to the local market, and you buy lots of cans of chili with beans
  which you proceed to empty into your least combustible, least
  corroded pot, the one you use for making the Krakatoa Spaghetti Sauce
  for which you are so justly famous.You empty in can after can of
  Hormel Hot Chili with Beans, Stagg Dynamite Chili with Beans, and
  Dennison Chunky Chili with Beans. And what you find, if you are of a
  discerning palate, is that you've created a concoction that tastes
  remarkably like well-warmed dog food. For aside from the mystery
  meats used to make canned Chilies, you also have a hot bubbling pot
  of soy protein concentrate, caramel coloring, calcium chloride,
  dehydrated onions and modified food starch. Which is not my idea of a
  fine Pot O' Red. You could probably get away with serving the stuff
  to your Football Buds, for by the time they get around to the chili,
  they'll probably have tucked away a six-pack of belly wash and pig
  sweat each. But if you're like me, you're a Gourmet Couch Potato. And
  you want to create a pot of chili that will be one for the ages.
  Which means you must delve into the wonderful world of what's
  technically referred to inthe trade as "tricking it up." In other
  words,can make an awfully fine chili by adding a lot of other
  ingredients to the canned stuff ++using the canned chili as the solid
  foundation upon which you build your gutbuster deluxe. Just about
  anything can be added, for chili is one of the least defined of all
  possible dishes ++ except that it's supposed to be spicy, just about
  anything can be chili. To make a truly memorable pot of grease, first
  pour in lots of cans of chili, remembering not to addthe cans
  themselves ++ aluminum tastes just awful, no matter how long you've
  cooked it. Then, look through your fridge. Are there some old onions
  sitting around, perhaps with nice green scallions sprouting out of
  them? Chop'em up, and drop 'em in! Do you have garlic in any of its
  manifold forms ++ fresh, pre-chopped, pickled, powdered, dried into a
  salt, orjust stuffed into an olive? Put it in++ chili likes lots of
  garlic. How about chili peppers? You can add all that you've got to
  the pot, along with bottles of Tabasco sauce, and whatever other
  salsa is leftover from your last Cinco de Mayo celebration. Don't
  forget to pour in some beer as well, especially Mexican beer. Also
  tequila, though not too much ++ the alcohol gets boiled out, and what
  fun is that? And since some sort of meat is called for, the first
  thing to do on that front is to dump in all the leftovers you've got
  sitting in the back of the fridge, though not the shrimp lo mein
  that's been sitting there since Groundhog Day ++ shrimp tastes really
  stupid in chili. Myself, I'm especially fond of a type of sausage
  called Little Smokies, which don't have to be chopped up or anything,
  and add the flavor of mesquite or pine cones or some such type of
  incinerated wood to the chili. Just keep on adding things until
  there's no room left in the pot. Then cook for a long time ++ high
  heat can kill all sorts of bacteria, and makes most mixtures taste
  pretty good. Especially during the fourth quarter of a tight game.
  The truly wonderful thing about chili is everyone can make it, for it
  is one of the few true examples of cooking that takes no
  skillwhatsoever. This is probably an upsetting concept to those who
  labor long and hard coming up with complex recipes for the many chili
  cookoffs that go on in this great land of ours.But the truth is that
  if you can turn on the heat on the stove, you can make chili. Heck,
  you can make chili even if you can't turn on the heat, though it will
  probably be downright toxic. Chili can be just as good ++ and just as
  bad ++ cooked from scratch, cooked from a can, or purchased from a
  low dive around which kitties and puppies keep disappearing.

           No Ingredients Found
 
  The joy of chili is that no one really seems to know exactly what the
  stuff is. I've had chili creations made with tofu, with cheese, with
  zucchini and with tuna (which made me want to hurl). There's a fair
  amount of scholarly argument concerning the nature of chili, some of
  which is worth dredging up, just for the record. In their very funny
  book called Cooking: A Dictionary, Henry Beard and Roy McKie define
  "chili" as, "An exceedingly hot-tasting plant of the genus Capsicum,
  usually added in powdered form to a dish made of shredded cattle."
  They further define "chili con carne" as, "Incendiary dogfood widely
  eaten in Texas." And a "chili parlor" is said to be, "A fistfight at
  which cooked beef is served."Most likely, chili was invented in
  Texas, where it's risen to the highstate of, as Will Rogers once
  said, "A bowl of blessedness." In Texas,the myths concerning the
  birth of chili are legion. Some claim it first emerged in San Antonio
  in the years before the Civil War. Others suggest it was created by
  Texans heading off for the gold fields of California, as a reminder
  of the fine, and spicy, tastes of home. Another theory contends that
  chili was invented in the prisons of Texas, as a way of making cheap
  meat taste edible. My favorite legend concerning chili is that it was
  first described by a mystical nun named Sister Mary of Agreda in the
  year 1618, after she emerged from one of her occasional trances.
  Whatever the origin, the point of chili is that it can be made out of
  just about anything. Like religion and politics, nobody agrees about
  the one true chili. Some argue for chunks of beef, while others
  insistthe beef must be ground. Some say beans, especially red kidney
  beans (as in Cincinnati-style chili) are perfectly appropriate;
  others rail that
  
  beans are simply cheap filler. Some says chili must be Simon pure,
  while others argue for the presence of lamb, mutton, cinnamon,
  chicken, duck ++ God knows what else. What I do know is that it goes
  great with beer. Lots of beer, especially if you get a sudden spasm
  adding the chili peppers. If that night the sheets do not touch the
  bed, your chili has been a wondrous success. Copyright 1995, Merrill

      Title: Amateur Lasagna
 Categories: Casseroles, Pasta/rice
      Yield: 10 servings
 
     10 oz Frozen spinach
     60 oz Spaghetti sauce -- two 30 oz
           Jars
      2 c  Ricotta cheese, part skim
           Milk
  1 1/2 c  Mozzarella cheese, part skim
           Milk -- shredded
      1    Egg -- beaten
      8 oz Lasagna noodles
    1/8 ts Black pepper
    1/2 ts Oregano -- optional
    1/2 ts Basil -- optional
    1/2 c  Vegetable juice cocktail
    1/2 c  Water
 
  * Spaghetti sauce is available in a 30 ounce jar and also in smaller
  containers. For this recipe, I use about 1-1/2  to 2 jars of the Ragu
  Sauce in the 30 ounce container.
  
  1. Thaw the spinach and squeeze dry.
  
  2. In a large container mix the two cheeses, beaten egg, black pepper,
  oregano and basil. Add the thawed spinach and blend well.
  
  3. Use a 13 x 9 inch pan. Put a small amount of the sauce in bottom
  and spread lightly to cover bottom. This keeps the lasagna from
  sticking as it cooks, and enables you to remove it easily in neat
  portions.
  
  4. Place one third of the uncooked noodles, one third of the sauce
  and one third of the cheese-spinach mixture. Make 3 layers this way,
  ending with the sauce.
  
  5. Combine the water and vegetable juice cocktail or tomato juice.
  Pour this carefully around the edges of the casserole, moving the
  noodles slightly with a spatula to get the liquid distributed evenly.
  Sprinkle with grated parmesan cheese if desired.
  
  6. Cover tightly with foil. Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour to 1 and
  1/4 hours. Remove foil and continue baking for a few minutes more,
  until lightly browned and bubbling.
  
  7. Let stand for at least 15 minutes before serving. This lasagna can
  be sliced with a flat edged spatula and lifted out in serving-sized
  portions.

  flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Cut in
  margarine using a pastry blender or two knives. 3. Make a well in
  center of mix and add mashed bananas and eggs. Mix well. You can do
  this with a wooden spoon, or since dough will be very stiff you may
  want to use your hands to mix it well. 4. Place dough on a lightly
  floured surface and roll to 1/2-inch thick. Cut with a 2-1/2 inch
  doughnut cutter that you dip in flour as needed. 5. Deep-fry, a few

      Title: Basic Cream Puffs
 Categories: Pastry
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      1 c  Water
    1/2 c  Margarine -- solid
      1 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  All-purpose flour
      4    Eggs
 
  1. Heat water, butter, sugar and salt to a full rolling boil in large
  saucepan. 2. Add flour all at once. Stir vigorously with a wooden
  spoon until mixture forms a thick, smooth ball that leaves the sides
  of pan clean, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. 3. Add eggs, one at a
  time, beating hard after each addition with wooden spoon or electric
  hand mixer, until paste is shiny and smooth.
  
  Shape and bake, following your recipe instructions, for making the
  puffs and filling with a creamy filling of your choice.
  
  * Most cream puff recipes instruct you to bake at 375 degrees until
  puff is delicately browned and there are no beads of moisture
  visible. Test for "doneness" by taking a puff out of the oven; if it
  does not fall, it is done.

 Categories: Pie/tart, Fruit
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 c  Flour
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Shortening -- solid
    1/3 c  Water
           Mixed fruit, dried --

  * Dried fruit which has been stewed and then sweetened is the
  traditional filling. The most common fruits used are dried apples and
  peaches.
  
  Sift the flour and salt together, cut in the shortening and mix with
  forks. Add water, a little at a time, while tossing flour mixture
  with large fork. Roll out about 1/8 inch thick on a floured surface.
  Cut about 4 inches in diameter. In each round, place 1-1/2
  tablespoons cooked and sweetened mashed fruit (dried apricots,
  peaches, prunes or applesauce). Moisten edges with cold water; fold
  to make semi-circle and press edges together with a fork. Fry in
  solid shortening melted to a depth of about 1/2 inch, or deep fry.
  Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired. If
  you wish, you can also make a sauce of powdered sugar, margarine and
  milk to drizzle over pies.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 c  Beef broth -- *see note
      2 c  Water
      1 c  Tomato juice
      2    Potatoes -- medium size
      3    Carrots -- diced
      1 sm Onion -- diced
      2    Celery stalks -- diced
    1/4 c  Green peppers -- diced
    1/2 c  Green beans -- chopped
    1/2 c  Lima beans
    1/2 c  Corn
      4 tb Margarine -- solid
    1/4 ts Black pepper
    1/2 ts Salt -- or to taste
 
  * Use about 6 cups liquid. You may mix chicken and beef broth (canned
  lowfat, not bouillon cubes) with water and tomato juice or vegetable
  juice cocktail to suit your tastes.
  
  1. Melt 4 tablespoons margarine in skillet. Add the chopped green
  peppers, carrots, celery and onion. Saute on low heat until
  vegetables are softened and onion browned lightly. Add this to the
  broth mixture which has been placed in a large, heavy pan with lid.
  2. Add to this the potatoes, green beans, lima beans and corn. Cover
  and simmer for about 45 minutes or until all the vegetables are done.
  Add the salt and pepper. 3. Remove about 2 cups of the mixture and
  put into blender. Puree this mixture and return to pot with rest of
  soup. Turn off heat and cover soup. Best if allowed to set for up to
  1 hour to blend flavors. Since this is a basic recipe for soup, you
  can add the vegetables you prefer and follow the directions above to
  finish the soup. Some suggestions: Add bay leaf, shredded cabbage,
  chopped zucchini, diced turnips, fresh tomatoes, okra or parsley. For
  added nutrition, serve with a sprinkling of lowfat cheese on the hot
  soup. Also good sprinkled with toasted croutons. This stores very
  well in refrigerator and is actually improved with time.

      Title: Candied Ginger-Sweet Potato Pie
 Categories: Pie/tart
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Orange -- *see note
      1 c  Water
      1 c  Sugar
      2 tb Candied ginger root
      2 c  Sweet potatoes -- mashed
    1/4 c  Whipping cream
      2 tb Margarine -- melted
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      6    Egg whites
    1/2 ts Cream of tartar
      3    Egg yolks
      1    9 inch pie crust -- unbaked
 
  * Prepare orange by cutting off strips of the rind, being careful not
  to include any of the white pulp just beneath the orange part of the
  rind. Cut enough rind and cut into small slivers to make 2
  tablespoons. Squeeze the orange and strain; measure out 1/2 cup and
  set aside.
  
  In small pan, combine 1 cup water and 1/2 cup sugar. Bring to a boil
  over high heat and then stir in orange rind that has been slivered.
  Lower heat and keep mixture at barely simmering state; simmer
  uncovered until mixture is like syrup, about 10 minutes or so. Stir
  in the ginger and set aside to cool to lukewarm. In a large bowl,
  combine the mashed potatoes, 1/2 cup orange juice, whipping cream,
  margarine, vanilla and the 3 egg yolks. Beat this until very well
  combined. Stir in the cooled syrup mixture and beat well. Place 2 egg
  whites in bowl and beat until soft peaks form. Stir this into potato
  mixture; do not beat but blend it very well. Pour this mixture into
  the unbaked pie shell. Make sure you smooth the top of the pie. Bake
  in a preheated 350-degree oven 45-50 minutes or until knife inserted
  1/3 distance from edge comes out clean. The center will be just the
  slightest bit soft. About 20 minutes before pie is done, prepare the
  topping.
  
  TOPPING: Place the 4 remaining egg whites in a large bowl along with
  the cream of tartar. Beat at low speed until frothy. Increase the
  speed and VERY gradually add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar. Continue
  beating until whites are very glossy and stiff. This will take about
  12-15 minutes. When pie is done, remove from oven and spoon on the
  egg whites. Don't smooth the top; make soft peaks with the back of a
  spoon. Continue baking for 10-15 minutes longer at the same
  350-degree temperature until meringue is very light brown. Remove to
  a wire rack to cool.
  
  * This topping will "weep" if kept overnight so plan to serve the
  same day it is prepared.

      6 lb Peaches
      8 c  Sugar
  2 3/4 c  Cider vinegar
      4    Cinnamon sticks
      4 ts Whole cloves -- * see note
 
  * Use additional cloves and cinnamon sticks for spicier peaches. This
  recipe calls for 24 medium-sized peaches, which is about 6 pounds
  total weight.
  
  1. Place into a large heavy kettle or sauce pan: sugar, cider
  vinegar, and 1-1/3 cups water. Tie cinnamon sticks and 4 teaspoons of
  whole cloves in a double thickness of cheesecloth; add to the
  saucepan. 2. Place pan over medium heat and stir until sugar is
  dissolved. Bring to boiling, cover, and boil for five minutes.
  Uncover and boil five minutes longer. 3. While sugar mixture is
  boiling, prepare peaches. Have a large pot of water boiling rapidly.
  Wash peaches, and working with 7 to 8 peaches at a time, plunge them
  into the boiling water. Immediately plunge into cold water and gently
  slip off the skins. Leave peaches whole or cut in half and remove
  pit. Whole peaches are the usual southern tradition. 4. Insert a
  whole clove into each peach, or for spicier peaches insert several
  cloves. Add peaches to hot syrup. Bring syrup to boiling again and
  simmer peaches for 10 minutes or until tender. 5. Quickly drain one
  sterilized jar. Pack hot peaches into jar, adding a cinnamon stick
  for spicier flavor. Cover top with waxed paper and set aside while
  preparing 2nd and 3rd jar. Repeat steps 3 through 5 with 7 to 8 more
  peaches for 2nd jar. Repeat again for 3rd jar. 6. Bring syrup to
  boiling and pour into jars to within 1/2 inch of top. Wipe away any
  food about fill line and on rim of jar; immediately seal.

           Note
    1/3 c  Honey
      1 c  Peanuts, oil-roasted
      1 ts Orange zest
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon -- ** see
           Note
      4 tb Margarine -- solid
 
  * About 1/2 cup corn unpopped; exact measurements are not required
  for this recipe. ** If you prefer, use another spice instead of
  cinnamon. Try nutmeg and allspice, or pumpkin pie spice.
  
  In a very large bowl or pan, mix popped corn and peanuts. In a small
  pan, mix the margarine, honey, orange zest and cinnamon. Heat,
  stirring, until the margarine is melted. With a wooden spoon or
  spatula in one hand, slowly pour this mixture over popcorn, tossing
  and mixing lightly as you pour. Place on a large cookie sheet, trying
  to layer as thinly as possible. Roast at 325 degrees, turning the
  popcorn every 5 minutes. When crispy, transfer to a platter and cool
  to room temperature. Do not overcook. May be stored in popcorn can or
  container at this point.

    1/2 c  Dried apricots OR peaches --
           Minced
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
 
  * Use half nonfat and half whole milk, or all nonfat for lower fat
  content.
  
  Substitute canned milk for the regular milk for a very rich flavor.
  The cooking time will vary greatly, anywhere from 1-1/2 to 3-1/2
  hours. The longer it cooks the thicker it will be. It is important to
  have the dried apricots minced. Put all ingredients into crockpot.
  Stir to blend well. Cover and cook on high 1-1/2 hours, stir once
  after about 1 hour. Or, cook on high for the first 30 minutes, turn
  to low and cook as long as you desire. Check after the first 2 hours
  of low cooking and stir. If rice is not absorbing the milk quickly
  enough, turn the crockpot up to high again. Keep cover on at all
  times.
  
  Crockpot temperatures vary widely among different brands. Only
  experimentation can tell you the correct amount of time for cooking
  in your crockpot. Rarely will a crockpot recipe fail, though, as the
  long, slow cooking process does not require precise timing.

      1 c  Cottage cheese
      2 tb Sugar
      1 tb Onion flakes
      1 tb Fresh dill weed -- * see
           Note
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Baking soda
      2    Eggs
      1 pk Yeast -- not instant
  2 1/2 c  Bread flour
    1/2 ts Margarine -- melted
 
  * Use dried dill weed or dill seeds if preferred.
  
  Have eggs at room temperature. Heat the cottage cheese until barely
  warm to touch, about 110 degrees. Mix the cottage cheese in large
  bowl along with sugar, onion, dill, salt, baking soda, eggs and
  yeast. Add flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to make a stiff batter. Beat
  well after each addition with an electric mixer flat beater, or use a
  wooden spoon if mixing by hand. Since this is a heavy batter, not a
  dough, it will not be kneaded. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and
  let rise in warm place for 1 hour or more. Remove the plastic wrap
  and stir down the batter with 20-25 strong strokes. Spoon the batter
  into a greased 1-1/2 quart casserole dish. Cover with wax paper and
  leave until the batter doubles in size, about 45 minutes. Keep the
  waxed paper from touching the batter or it may collapse when the
  paper is pulled away. Bake in a PREHEATED 350-degree oven for 40-45
  minutes or until deep brown and crusty. Test with a wooden toothpick
  and if it does not come out clean, then bake 5-8 minutes longer.
  Remove bread from oven and immediately brush with the margarine.
  Sprinkle with salt if desired. You might use coarse salt as an
  interesting variation.

      2 lg Eggs
      2 ts Sugar -- * see note
    2/3 c  Milk
      1 ts Salad oil
    1/2 ts Lemon juice
           Mixed fruit
           Mixed vegetables
 
  * If you are preparing vegetable fritters, omit the sugar. For a
  thinner coating, add more milk and omit baking powder. For a fluffier
  coating, beat egg whites separately and add to batter last.
  
  1. Sift flour, baking powder and salt together. 2. Beat the eggs until
  light and fluffy. Add sugar, milk, oil and dash of lemon juice; add
  flour mixture and stir only long enough to dampen. Add a dash of
  cinnamon to the flour when making fruit fritters. 3. Prepare fritters.
  
  FRUIT: Apples: Peel, core and cut in 1/2-inch slices. Bananas: Cut
  into chunks and sprinkle with lemon juice and sugar. Use canned
  peaches, pineapple etc. by draining; sprinkle very lightly with flour
  before dipping into batter.
  
  VEGETABLES: Cut into equal-sized pieces to keep frying time
  approximately the same.
  
  4. Heat oil in deep skillet or container until about 370 degrees. Cook
  fritters until delicately brown, then drain on paper towels. Exact
  times will vary. Test one  piece of fruit or vegetable to get an idea
  of how long to cook. If batter does not cling well enough, add a bit
  more flour. A very important point to remember is to have the oil hot
  enough and keep it at the same temperature throughout cooking.

 Categories: Breakfast, Fruit
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      5 tb Margarine (not diet)
  2 1/2 c  Onions -- sliced
      2 lg Granny Smith apples
      8 lg Eggs
      3 tb Heavy cream
           Salt -- to taste
           Black pepper -- to taste
           Ground nutmeg -- to taste
      4 tb Sour cream
 
  1. In a heavy skillet, melt 2 tablespoons margarine and add the onions
  which have been sliced thin and separated into rings. Stir to cover
  with the margarine. Cover the pan and cook over low heat for 10
  minutes or until onions are translucent. 2. Wash apples and core but
  do not peel. Slice into 1/2 to 3/4-inch crescents. When onions are
  done, transfer to a plate and keep warm. Wipe out the skillet and add
  1 tablespoon margarine and melt. Add the apple slices; saute over
  medium flame until browned, about 1 minute. Turn slices and brown
  other side. Do not overcook. Turn off heat, add onion and combine;
  set aside. 3. To prepare eggs for cooking, place 8 egg yolks and 6
  egg whites into large bowl. Add the cream, salt and pepper to your
  taste and beat this mixture lightly with fork. Set aside. 4. Place
  the remaining 2 egg whites in a bowl and, with a mixer, beat on high
  speed until whites are stiff but not dry. Blend the egg yolk mixture
  again to be sure it is not separated, then fold in the beaten whites.
  DO NOT beat in, only fold in gently until thoroughly blended. 5.
  Using an omelet pan, melt 1 tablespoon margarine over medium heat.
  When margarine foams, add half the egg mixture. As eggs begin to set,
  use a fork to pull edges gently towards center, allowing uncooked
  eggs to flow outward. Cook until eggs are brown on bottom but still
  moist on top, 4-5 minutes. 6. Spread half the apple-onion mixture on
  one-half of the omelet. Use a spatula to fold other half over the
  apple mixture. Place on serving plate and keep warm in oven while
  preparing the remaining omelet. When second omelet is prepared,
  divide both among 4 serving plates. Top each with a tablespoon of
  sour cream and a very light sprinkling of fresh ground nutmeg. Serve
  immediately.

      1 c  Heavy whipping cream
    1/2 c  Water
      2    Ice cubes
 
  Fit the steel knife blade into the work bowl of your food processor.
  Process cream until whipped, about 30 seconds. Add water and ice
  cubes. Process 2-3 minutes until butter has formed and separated from
  the liquid. No harm will be done if you overwhip this mixture. Pour
  butter and liquid into a fine strainer. With a rubber spatula, gently
  press butter against sieve to remove excess moisture. DO NOT press
  too hard or butter will go through strainer. Refrigerate butter in a
  covered container.
  
  This makes 1/3 cup butter. If you prefer salted butter, add 1/8
  teaspoon or less of salt to cream before processing.

      Title: Homemade Tomato Sauce
 Categories: Can/preserv
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      8    1-pint canning jars
     15 lb Tomatoes
      2 c  Chopped onions
      1 c  Green bell peppers --
           Chopped
      1 c  Celery -- diced
      2 tb Brown sugar
      2    Garlic cloves -- minced
      1 tb Fresh parsley -- minced
      1 tb Fresh basil
      1 tb Oregano
  1 1/2 tb Non-iodized salt -- * see
           Note
    1/2 ts Black pepper
 
  * Kosher salt is the best to use for canning.
  
  1. Prepare jars following manufacturer's directions for sterilizing.
  2. Use 12-15 pound of fresh, ripe tomatoes. If you want them peeled,
  dip in boiling water briefly until skins split. Rinse in cold water.
  Remove cores and any green spots. To reduce cooking time, chop
  tomatoes. Put into a large, heavy pan. It is very important to use a
  heavy pan to prevent tomatoes from sticking and scorching. Simmer the
  tomatoes for 2 hours, stirring frequently. 3. Add the remaining
  ingredients and simmer overnight or until the sauce has cooked down
  by half. To prevent sauce from sticking, fill a large roasting pan
  with the sauce, set it in a 250-degree oven, and let it cook until it
  is as thick as you want it; stir occasionally as it cooks. The sauce
  will not stick using this method. If you want a smooth sauce, or if
  you have not peeled the tomatoes, you can sieve the sauce or use a
  blender or food processor to make it smooth. 4. When sauce is the
  consistency you desire, pour it into hot jars, leaving 1/4-inch of
  head space. Adjust lids. Process in a pressure canner with 10 pounds
  pressure, 20 minutes for pints, 25 for quarts.
  
  Yield: 8 pints.
  
  NOTE: See "Tomato Jam" in this cookbook if you make this using a
  boiling water bath instead of a pressure canner. Omit the onion,
  green peppers and celery if using water bath; 45 minutes in a boiling
  water bath is then sufficient. You can freeze this sauce, including
  the onion, green pepper and celery if you prefer. This recipe is
  given using all three methods of preserving this sauce because many
  people are going back to the old ways of canning produce. If
  freezing, freeze in proportions to use all at one time in a recipe.
  Usually 1 quart of sauce will make a recipe for 4 to 6 people.

      1 c  English walnuts -- chopped
    1/4 ts Salt
      2    Egg yolks
      1 ts Lemon peel -- grated
 
  1. Do not sift flour. Place 1-1/2 cups flour in a large bowl. Add
  sugar, salt, lemon peel and yeast. Soften margarine and add to flour
  mixture. 2. Add 1-1/3 cups very warm (120-130 degree) water to the
  flour mixture and beat 2 minutes at medium speed; scrape bowl
  occasionally. 3. Add eggs and 1/2 cup flour; beat at high speed for 2
  minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Stir in more flour to make a
  soft dough. Cover and let rest for 20 minutes. 4. Turn dough out onto
  well-floured surface; divide into 3 parts. 5. Roll each piece to an
  8-inch square. Cut each square into eight 1-inch strips. Twist each
  strip and coil in a circle, sealing ends underneath. Place on greased
  cookie sheet. 6. Make a wide indentation in center of each roll,
  pressing to the bottom. Spoon filling into indentations, using 1
  teaspoon for each roll. 7. Cover loosely and let rise in warm,
  draft-free place until doubled in bulk. Bake in preheated 375-degree
  oven for 15-20 minutes or until done. Repeat with each piece of dough.
  
  TO FREEZE: After filling with nut-honey filling, place on greased
  cookie sheets, cover with plastic wrap and freeze. When frozen,
  remove from cookie sheets and place in plastic freezer bags. To bake,
  remove from freezer, let stand at room temperature until completely
  thawed. This will take about 1-1/2 to 2 hours. Let rise in warm place
  until doubled in size, about 45 minutes after thawing.
  
  FILLING: Combine 1/3 cup honey, 1 cup finely chopped nuts, and salt in
  saucepan. Bring to a boil and simmer over low heat for 3 minutes.
  Gradually stir in beaten egg yolks and cook, stirring, until slightly
  thickened. Stir in lemon peel then cool.

      Title: Like Magic Meringue Cake
 Categories: Cake/cookie
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      8    Egg whites
      1 ts Fresh lemon juice
    3/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Almond extract
 
  1. Grease a bundt pan heavily with vegetable oil. Preheat oven to 350
  degrees. 2. In a large mixing bowl beat the egg whites with an
  electric mixer. As the whites begin to feel and look firm begin
  adding the sugar by teaspoons. Don't rush the mixing. Mix well after
  each addition before adding more sugar. 3. Add the almond extract and
  continue beating until whites hold their shape. 4. Carefully spoon
  the whites into the bundt pan. Make sure there are no air pockets.
  Push a knife blade down into meringue slowly to get rid of the air
  pockets. Cover the top of the meringue with waxed paper and put the
  pan into a larger round pan. 5. Add water to the larger pan to come
  halfway up the sides of the bundt pan. Bake until the meringue is
  firm and dry, about 30-35 minutes. 6. Remove the pans from oven and
  place the bundt pan on a cooling rack. Cool the meringue cake
  completely before removing from the bundt pan onto a serving plate.
  Top with your choice of topping and slice carefully with a serrated
  knife or slice first, then top each individual serving.
  
  * This does not keep well so plan to serve the same day you prepare
  it.

      Title: Lima Bean And Ham Stew
 Categories: Meats, Vegetables
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      3    Ham hocks
      1 lb Lima beans
      3 c  Chicken broth
      3 c  Water
      2    Garlic cloves
      2    Bermuda onions
      1 c  Celery -- diced
      1 c  Carrots -- sliced
      1    Bay leaves
           Hot pepper sauce --
           Optional
 
  1. Prepare lima beans by picking over to remove any debris that might
  be in package. Rinse beans well. Cover with about 8 cups water. Bring
  to a boil, cover and boil 2 minutes. Remove from heat, keep covered
  and allow to stand for 1 hour or more. 2. While beans are soaking,
  prepare the ham hocks (or use meaty ham bones). Combine the 3 cups
  broth and 3 cups water in a large heavy pan with lid; bring to a
  boil. Add the ham and simmer for about 1 hour. 3. Drain the beans,
  running hot water over beans briefly to rinse. Add the beans to the
  ham mixture. Slice the onions and separate into rings. Add the
  onions, along with the carrots, celery, and bay leaf, to the pot.
  Mince the garlic cloves or use a garlic press; add to mixture. Add
  fresh ground black pepper and salt if you prefer. Ham is salted
  already so you may not want to add salt at this point. Pour
  additional broth or hot water over this mixture to reach about 1 inch
  above the ingredients. 4. Simmer for about 1 hour, stirring several
  times, checking to see if you need to add more liquid. After beans
  and vegetables are tender, remove the ham hocks or bone. Remove the
  meat from bones and add back to the bean mixture. Taste and add more
  salt or pepper if you wish; also add hot pepper sauce to your taste.

    2/3 c  Vegetable shortening
      7 tb Peach syrup

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      2 tb Margarine
     29 oz Peach halves in syrup -- 1
           Can
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/3 c  Sugar
      2 tb Cornstarch
      2 tb Light corn syrup
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      2 lg Eggs
      1 tb Lemon juice
      3 oz Cream cheese -- softened
    1/2 c  Sour cream
           Candied citrus peel -- * see
           Note
 
  * Make candied orange peel for cooking purposes by shredding the peel
  of an orange into very thin strips. Avoid getting any of the white
  pith below the peel. Mix 1/2 cup water and 1 cup sugar in a saucepan.
  Bring to a boil and add the orange peel. Boil for 5-10 minutes,
  stirring often to prevent sticking. Let cool in pan, then remove peel
  from syrup to drain and dry on waxed paper. You can freeze orange
  peel after cooling for future recipe use. This is not as sweet as
  regular candied orange peel, but works well for cooking purposes.
  
  PIE CRUST: 1. Combine flour with salt. Cut in shortening with pastry
  cutter until mixture is like coarse cornmeal. Sprinkle with 6-7
  tablespoons of syrup drained from peaches while tossing mixture with
  a large fork until mixture holds together. 2. Divide dough into 2
  parts. Roll out one part on lightly floured surface, 1-2 inches
  larger than an inverted 9-inch pie plate. Fit dough into plate and
  flute edges. Roll second half of dough and cut into shapes with
  cookie cutters or glass dipped into flour. Leave on pastry board
  while preparing filling.
  
  FILLING: 3. Drain peaches and cut into slices, reserving syrup.
  Combine slices with 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch, corn syrup, cinnamon,
  vanilla and cooled candied orange peel (2-3 tablespoons). Put mixture
  into pie crust and dot with margarine.
  
  TOPPING: 4. Place in small saucepan the eggs which have been beaten
  slightly, add 1/3 cup sugar, lemon juice and 2 tablespoons peach
  syrup. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is thick. 5. Combine
  softened cream cheese with the sour cream. Add the hot mixture to
  this and beat until smooth. Spread over the peach filling. 6. Place
  the cut-outs of pastry on top of pie and bake in preheated 425-degree
  oven for 10 minutes. Cover edges of pastry with foil; bake at 350
  degrees for 30-35 minutes longer or until crust is deep golden brown.

      1 tb Wheat germ
      2 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Margarine
      2 ts Ground cinnamon
  1 1/4 c  Milk -- at room temperature
    1/2 c  Raisins
    1/4 c  Dried apricots
 
  * Vital gluten can be found at health food stores and at some grocery
  stores. It helps to make the bread rise and gives it a tender texture.
  
  Chop the apricots into small pieces, or use dates if you prefer.
  Place all ingredients except raisins and apricots (or dates) into
  your breadmaker following manufacturer's directions. Add the raisins
  and apricots at appropriate time; in a Zojirushi and most other
  breadmakers, there is an option for raisin bread that will allow the
  machine to beep when it is time to add additional ingredients.

      Title: Ramrod Biscuits For Camping
 Categories: Breads, Bbq/grill
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 c  Biscuit mix
    1/4 c  Nonfat dry milk, instant
    2/3 c  Water
           Honey
           Jelly
 
  * Have a good campfire going before mixing these biscuits. Also have
  some smooth dry sticks about 3/4 inch in diameter ready. Be careful
  to know what kind of wood is safe -- NEVER use Oleander wood.
  
  Mix the biscuit mix (such as Bisquick) and dry milk together and take
  camping in a plastic baggie or in a bowl with lid so that you can
  just make the biscuits in the same container. Take along some honey
  or jelly for eating with this. Mix only enough of the water into the
  dry ingredients to make a stiff dough. Divide into 6 portions and
  shape dough around the end of each stick. Roast over the fire until
  golden brown. Remove from stick and fill with honey or jelly if
  desired.

      4 tb Thousand island salad
           Dressing
      5    Gherkins
 
  * Omelets will be prepared one at a time in omelet or similar pan, so
  it is a good idea to have oven barely warm to keep prepared omelets
  in while preparing others.
  
  Have corned beef sliced into thin slices, about 12 pieces if possible.
  Drain sauerkraut through strainer over bowl until very well drained.
  Discard liquid. Mince one gherkin and add to the thousand island
  dressing. 1. Break eggs into bowl, add 1/2 cup water and caraway
  seeds (unless sauerkraut already has caraway in it). Beat eggs until
  thoroughly blended. 2. Place omelet pan over medium heat. When hot,
  add 1 tablespoon solid margarine to pan and tilt to coat sides and
  bottom. Turn heat to medium-high. Pour in one quarter of eggs. Using
  wide spatula or fork, pull cooked eggs toward center, allowing
  uncooked part to flow to outside. While top is still moist and
  creamy, add 2 slices Swiss cheese to one side of omelet, top with 1/4
  of the corned beef and then top with 1/4 cup sauerkraut. Fold other
  side over and immediately remove to serving plate. Keep in barely
  warm oven while preparing remaining 3 omelets. Wipe pan with paper
  towels between each omelet.
  
  To serve, top each with 1/4 of the dressing and serve one gherkin
  along side omelet.

      Title: Snow Eggs
 Categories: Desserts, Alcohol
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      5    Egg whites
      2 tb Powdered sugar
    1/2 ts Orange extract
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
      2 c  Whole milk
      3 tb Granulated sugar
      3    Egg yolks
           Wine -- optional
 
  Beat the egg whites until you can turn the bowl upside down without
  the whites falling out. Gradually add the powdered sugar, 1/4
  teaspoon orange extract and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract or other
  flavoring. (Thomas Jefferson used orange flower or rose water.) Put
  milk into a 10-inch heavy skillet and add the granulated sugar and
  remaining orange and vanilla extracts. Slowly bring to a simmer. Drop
  tablespoonfuls of egg white into hot milk and poach until set. Turn
  the mounds after about 1-2 minutes of cooking. You will need to make
  these in batches as it won't all fit in skillet at once. The egg
  whites will puff a bit while cooking. It should take about 4-5
  minutes for each batch to cook. Lay them on a wire rack to drain.
  Beat the egg yolks until thick. Add a small amount of the hot milk to
  the yolks, then stir gradually into the milk. Continue to stir while
  cooking, until the custard thickens. Pour custard through a sieve.
  Put the cooked whites in a serving dish and pour the custard over
  them. Serve immediately.

    3/4 ts Ground nutmeg
           Cinnamon sticks -- *see
           Note
 
  * Cinnamon sticks are optional but make a very pretty addition as
  stirrers in steaming hot mugs of punch.
  
  Combine all the ingredients in a very large heavy pan, except the
  cinnamon sticks. Bring to a boil and turn to simmer for few minutes.
  You can put the ingredients in a crockpot after it has boiled and
  keep warm over low heat.
  
  This recipe can be easily doubled or halved.

      Title: Black Beans With Saffron Rice (Vegetarian)
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetables, Pasta/rice
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      2 c  Black beans
      4 c  Water
      1    Onion -- halved
      3    Bay leaves
      6    Garlic cloves -- whole
      2 c  Rice
    1/3 ts Saffron
           Garnish:
      6    Tomatoes -- seeded and
           Chopped
      2 c  Onions -- chopped
      6 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Wine vinegar
      1 ts Ground cumin
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
      4 tb Fresh basil -- or parsley
           Black pepper
 
  * Use Vidalia onions for the garnish if available. If not, use other
  sweet onions such as Maui, Walla Walla, Texas 1015, or Imperial Sweet.
  
  1. Rinse and sort the beans. Put into a large, heavy pot with lid.
  Cover with the 4 cups water. Bring to a boil, cover, and remove from
  heat. Let stand for 2 hours.
  
  2. Add the halved onions, bay leaves and garlic to beans. Place over
  low heat and cook, covered, until beans are tender; about 1-1/2 to 2
  hours. Check water and add more if needed while cooking.
  
  3. Remove and discard the onion, bay leaves and garlic cloves. Keep
  beans warm.
  
  4. Prepare the garnish about 1 hour before serving. Place the
  tomatoes and onion into a serving bowl. Add the olive oil, vinegar,
  cumin, cayenne, parsley or basil and black pepper to taste. Toss to
  blend.
  
  5. Bring 4 cups water to boiling in a heavy saucepan with tight
  fitting lid. Add the rice and saffron threads (do not use too much
  saffron). Stir well, cover, reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes or
  until the rice has absorbed all the water.
  
  6. To serve, place the rice, black beans, and the garnish into
  separate bowls. Guests can serve themselves by placing a serving of
  rice, topping with the beans and lastly with the garnish on their
  plates.
  
  * Cut this recipe in half if you wish. It is really best not to
  double this as cooking times will vary depending on the size and
  thickness of cookware used.

      1 lg Egg -- beaten
    1/2 c  Milk
    1/4 ts Salt -- optional
 
  * The use of sliced parsnips is optional.
  
  1. Tie parsley and dill springs with thread. Cut the chicken into
  serving-sized pieces. Put the chicken and its giblets, discarding the
  liver, into very large heavy pot. Add the carrots, onions, parsnips
  (if using), pepper, chopped parsley or dill and the tied sprigs. Add
  enough water to cover all ingredients. Bring to a boil, then reduce
  heat and simmer for 45-60 minutes or until chicken is tender. Skim
  off the fat and foam as it rises to surface. 2. When the chicken is
  done, remove and discard the parsley and dill sprigs. Using a slotted
  spoon, place the chicken and vegetables into a bowl and keep warm in
  an oven that has been slightly heated then heat turned off. 3.
  DUMPLINGS: Place the flour into a large bowl. In another bowl, blend
  together the beaten egg, 1/3 cup chopped parsley, poultry or dried
  sage, pepper and milk. Mix well and refrigerate batter until ready to
  use. 4. Bring the broth to a boil and lower heat to keep at a slow
  boil. Drop the batter by rounded teaspoons into the broth. COVER
  tightly and simmer for 15 minutes. Do not remove lid during this
  time. 5. Remove dumplings with slotted spoon and add them to the
  chicken and vegetables. Spoon some of the broth over all and garnish
  with chopped parsley if desired.
  
  Serve immediately with the broth placed into cups for each serving.

 Categories: Chinese, Meats
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Egg yolk
      2 ts Water
      1 tb All-purpose flour
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 lb Pork -- 1" cubes
      2 c  Peanut oil

      1 c  Pineapple chunks in juice
      3 c  Glutinous rice

    3/4 c  Water
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Catsup
      4 tb Sugar
      4 tb Wine vinegar
      1 ds Hot pepper sauce
 
  SAUCE: Blend the water and cornstarch until smooth. Stir in the
  catsup, soy sauce, sugar, vinegar and, if desired, a few drops of hot
  pepper seasoning. Set aside.
  
  PORK: Beat egg yolk with the water. Blend in 1 tablespoon flour and 1
  tablespoon cornstarch until smooth. Add the cubed pork and mix to coat
  well. Drain off the excess mixture from the pork cubes. Place the wok
  over heat and add oil to 1-1/2 inch depth. Heat to 340 degrees. Use a
  thermometer if you can; it is more reliable than a wok with a
  temperature gauge. Add the drained meat and cook until golden brown,
  about 10-13 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and keep meat warm.
  Pour off all the oil and wipe wok with a paper towel. Return 2
  tablespoons of the oil to wok. Place over medium-high heat. When oil
  is hot, add the garlic and green peppers. Stir-fry for about 2
  minutes, or until garlic is light brown. Add the pineapple, the sauce
  you prepared ahead of time and the pork. Stir this mixture until it
  boils and thickens (about 1-1/2 minutes). Serve over steamy hot rice.

 Categories: Snacks, Condiments, Herbs/spice
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/3 c  Rice vinegar
    1/3 c  Soy sauce; reduced sodium
    1/3 c  Honey
     20 ea Garlic bud spears
      6    To 8 inches tall
      1 c  Water
 
  These are quick refrigerator pickles that are tasty additions to just
  about everything except dessert. Chop or slice thin the long way and
  try them on sandwiches, in omelets and with most any grain or bean
  dish.
  
  Mix vinegar, soy sauce and honey together; set aside. Lay garlic buds
  flat in a large skillet with a tight fitting lid. Add the water,
  cover and bring to a boil; reduce heat to a low simmer and cook about
  3 minutes or until stems are just tender. Reserve liquid for other
  uses such as soup or sauce.
  
  Using tongs, move garlic buds to a large, flat, refrigerator glass or
  ceramic container with a cover. Pour vinegar mixture over garlic buds;
  close container and refrigerate.
  
  Pickled garlic spears will be ready to use after marinating at least
  overnight. Pickles keep refrigerated about 3 weeks. The marinade can
  be used again for another batch of garlic buds, or use it as a garlic
  flavored base for barbecue sauce.

      Title: Pretzels
 Categories: Snacks, Breads
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      1 pk Yeast
  1 1/2 c  Warm water
      5 c  Flour -- approximate
      2 ts Salt
      1 tb Sugar
 
  Combine yeast and 1/2 c warm water in a measuring cup, stirring until
  dissolved.
  
  Combine 2 c flour, the salt and the sugar in a bowl.  Add dissolved
  yeast and remaining 1 c warm water.  Beat vigorously with whisk or
  spoon for 2 minutes.  Gradually add enough flour, 1/4 cup at a time,
  to make a soft dough.  Turn out of bowl onto a clean work surface.
  Knead until smooth and elastic, adding as little flour as necessary,
  about 8-10 minutes.
  
  Place dough in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and put in a warm
  place to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
  
  Punch dough down and divide into 12 equal pieces.  Roll out each
  portion into an 18-20 inch long rope, slightly tapered and thinner at
  the ends. (My note:  You may have to roll the dough out partially,
  let rest, and then finish rolling out to get the rope this long.)
  Form into pretzel shapes. Place on 5 inch square of parchment paper.
  (Also works on waxed paper sprayed with nonstick cooking spray.)
  Cover with towel, let rest 20-30 minutes.
  
  Bring to a boil 6 cups of water, 1/3 c baking soda, and 1/3 c salt in
  a large shallow pan.  Gently drop 3 or 4 pretzels into the simmering
  water, parchment side up.  Remove parchment.  Poach first side 2
  minutes.  Turn and cook other side 2 minutes.  Remove pretzels with
  slotted spoon and place on towels to cool.
  
  Brush pretzels with an egg white wash (1 egg white mixed with 1 Tbsp
  water) and sprinkle with coarse salt.  Bake on a greased, foil lined
  (this is important!!) baking sheet at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.
  Remove from baking sheet and cool on wire rack.
  
  These freeze well.

      Title: Belgian Beef Carbonnade
 Categories: Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 tb Flour
      2 ts Salt
      1 ts Pepper
      1 ts Paprika
      3 lb Round steak or chuck, cut
           -into 1" cubes
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine
      6 lg Onions, sliced
      1 sm Cheesecloth
      1    Bay leaf
    1/4 ts Dried thyme
    1/2 c  Chopped celery leaves
      3 tb Brown sugar
  2 1/2 c  Beer
      2 tb Cider or malt vinegar
      1    Garlic clove, halved
    1/4 c  Chopped parsley
 
  This family dish is world renowned. The combination of beer, brown
  sugar and thyme blends into one delicate, pleasant flavor. Since the
  stew is twice as good reheated over low heat, make it for the family
  in a large quantity. It also freezes exceptionally well.
  
  Blend together the 4 tablespoons flour, 2 teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon
  pepper, and 1 teaspoon paprika, in a large bowl. Roll the meat cubes
  in this mixture until they are well coated.
  
  Melt the 1/2 cup butter or margarine in a large heavy metal saucepan.
  Add the 6 large sliced onions, and saute' over medium heat until they
  are softened and tender. Be careful not to brown the onions. Remove
  the onions from the pan with a perforated spoon, pressing out as much
  fat as possible.
  
  Place the same pan over high heat and sear the cubes of meat, a few
  at a time. This operation will give color to the finished carbonnade.
  Return the onions and meat to the pan, and set it over low heat.
  
  Tie together in a square cheesecloth the halved garlic clove, 1 bay
  leaf, 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme, and 1/2 cup chopped celery leaves.
  
  Add this to the meat, sprinkle the 1/4 cup chopped parsley on top,
  and add the 3 tablespoons brown sugar and 2 1/2 cups beer. Bring to a
  simmer, while stirring, then cover tightly and poach over low heat
  until the meat is tender, about 1 1/2 hours.
  
  Discard the bouquet garni, or cheesecloth bag of seasonings. Add the 2
  tablespoons vinegar. Simmer for 5 minutes.
  
  Serve with a dish of boiled potatoes and a beet salad or pickled
  beets. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On   08-02-95

  12-10" bamboo skewers in water at least 10 minutes.
  
  Combine all above ingredients except the beef and peanut curry sauce.
  
  Cut steak slices diagonally against the grain into 1/8 inch thick
  slices. Place beef slices in the marinade you made earlier, place in
  refrigerator 3 to 4 hours. Turn occasionally.
  
  Prepare peanut curry sauce as follows: plain non-fat or low fat
  yogurt, cream of coconut, creamy peanut butter, curry powder, and
  grated fresh ginger.
  
  Remove beef from marinade, place meat, pineapple, cucumber chunks,
  green onion tops, and red bell peppers on skewers as desired.
  
  Place the skewers with meat and other stuff on it, on the grill, it
  should have medium hot coals. Stay close, this doesn't take long. Turn
  occasionally and brush with the marinade sauce that you used earlier.
  Remove from fire when meat is done to your taste.
  
  Push the meat, etc. from your skewer to your plate. Spoon peanut curry
  sauce over it, AND ENJOY!!!
  
  This recipe requires no additional side dishes, but from experience I
  can give you a strong hint, finish it off with ice cream, and a
  bottle of good Port wine. Trust me ...

 Categories: Meats, Aust/german
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      4 lb Top round or boneless chuck
  1 1/4 c  Boiling water
    1/4 ts Dried sage
  1 1/4 ts Salt
    1/3 ts Pepper
      4 tb Butter or margarine
    1/4 c  Maderia wine
  1 1/2 tb Meat extract
    2/3 c  Tarragon vinegar
    2/3 ts Dried thyme
  1 1/4 tb Dry mustard
      4 tb Flour
      1 cn (1/2 cup) tomato paste
 
  Preparation time: 2 1/2 hours
  
  Note: Save all used ingredients. Many are used again later.
  
  Important note: Begin this dish three to four days before you plan to
  serve it.
  
  Add the 1 1/2 tablespoon meat extract to the 1 1/4 cup boiling water,
  stir until well mixed, add 2/3 cup tarragon vinegar, 1/4 teaspoon
  sage, 2/3 teaspoon thyme, 1 1/4 tablespoon dry mustard, 1 1/4
  teaspoon salt, 1/3 teaspoon pepper. Stir to mix thoroughly.
  
  Wipe the meat with a clean, damp cloth and place meat in a deep bowl.
  Pour the hot liquid from the above step over it, cover, and keep in
  the refrigerator 3 days. Turn the meat at least once a day.
  
  After 3 days, drain the meat, and saute' it in the 4 tablespoons
  melted butter in an iron or cast aluminum kettle 5 minutes, turning
  on all sides. Remember, save the liquid.
  
  Remove the meat from the kettle. Stir the 4 tablespoons flour into the
  drippings left in the kettle from the last step. Add the liquid in
  which the meat soaked for three days, (I told you to keep
  everything), stir and simmer until thick and smooth.
  
  Place the meat in this gravy, cover and simmer 2 1/2 hours. Turn it
  several times in the kettle.
  
  Remove the meat to a hot platter, add the 1/2 cup tomato paste and 1/4
  Maderia wine to the gravy in the kettle. Stir, heat 1 or 2 minutes
  and pour over the meat.
  
  When you eat this, think of me. I just love this stuff. Green beans,
  Au gratin potatoes, and a good bottle of NAPA Valley Cabernet
  Sauvignan go well with this meal. Enjoy ...

      Title: Roasted Garlic and Leek Chowder
 Categories: Soup/stew, Herbs/spice, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 tb Unsalted butter
      6 ea Large garlic cloves
      1 oz Salt pork - diced (1/3 cup)
      3 ea Medium leeks - chopped
           -(white and tender green)
      2 ea Medium carrots - diced
      1 ea Celery rib - finely
           -chopped (with leaves)
      4 c  Chicken stock - or canned
           -broth
      2 ea Medium baking potatoes -
           -peeled & cut into 1/2-in.
           Dice (about 1 pound)
      1 ts Fresh sage - chopped
           Salt & freshly ground
           -pepper to taste
      1 tb Parsley - chopped
 
  1.  The garlic cloves in this chowder can be roasted unpeeled in a
  350F. oven for 25 minutes, then peeled and mashed, OR:  In a small
  skillet, melt the butter over very low heat.  Add the garlic cloves,
  cover and cook, turning once, until tender, about 25 minutes; the
  garlic will be golden, but should not burn. Using a fork, mash the
  garlic to a paste. 2. Meanwhile, blanch the salt pork in a small
  saucepan of boiling water for 3 minutes. Drain well. 3. In a large
  heavy saucepan, fry the salt pork over moderate heat until golden,
  about 4 minutes. Discard all but 1 tablespoon of the fat, but leave
  the salt pork in the pan. Add the leeks and cook, stirring
  constantly, for 1 minute. Stir in the garlic paste and cook for 1
  minute longer.  Stir in the carrots and celery.  Reduce the heat to
  moderate, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables
  have softened, about 10 minutes. 4. Stir in the chicken stock and
  bring to a boil over moderately high heat. Add the potatoes and
  return to a boil. Reduce the heat to moderate and simmer until the
  potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. 5. Transfer 1 cup of the
  chowder to a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. Return
  the puree to the chowder and stir in the sage.  Season with salt and
  pepper to taste. Ladle the chowder into bowls and garnish with the
  parsley.
  
  Makes 3 to 4 servings.

      Title: Garlic Jam
 Categories: Herbs/spice, Condiments
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      4 ea Whole heads of garlic -
           -about 14 ounces
      1 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
      1 ea Medium onion - unpeeled
           -and halved lengthwise
           Salt (optional)
 
  1.  Preheat the oven to 350F. Using a large sharp knife, cut off
  1/2-inch from the top of each head of garlic to expose some of the
  flesh. 2. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of the oil over the bottom of a gratin
  or glass pie dish. Place the garlic and the onion halves cut sides
  down in the dish, cover tightly with foil and bake for 45 minutes,
  until very soft to the touch. Uncover and let cool for 20 minutes. 3.
  Peel the onion halves and finely chop them.  Place in a medium bowl.
  Squeeze the garlic pulp from the skins into the bowl; discard the
  skins. Using a fork, stir in the remaining 2 teaspoons oil and mash
  with the onion and garlic until thoroughly incorporated.  Season with
  salt if desired. (The garlic jam will keep refrigerated in a glass
  jar for up to 2 weeks.)
  
  Makes 1-1/3 cups.
  
  Use this condiment with roasted meats or as a spread for toasted
  croutons or cold meat sandwiches, or try a spoonful of it mixed into
  homemade salad dressings and sauces.

           Risotto al Pomodori Secchi,
           -Piselli, e Caprino
 
  The intense taste of the sun-dried tomatoes gives this risotto its
  formidable character. Sallie's Notes: Amounts in brackets are for 2
  servings, as I make it. My modifications/notes are also in brackets. 5
  tablespoons unsalted butter [2 Tbsp] 2 tablespoons pure olive oil [1
  Tbsp] 1/2 cup finely chopped onion [1 small shallot] 2 cups uncooked
  Italian short-grain rice (Arborio, Vialone, or Carnaroli) [2/3 cup]
  1/2 cup dry white wine [1/3 cup] 6 1/2 cups (about) hot chicken broth
  [14 1/2 oz can- low salt] 1/2 cup coarsely chopped sun-dried tomatoes
  packed in oil [3 halves] 1 cup fresh shelled peas or defrosted frozen
  peas [about 1/2 cup] 4 ounces creamy goat cheese, crumbled [about 2
  Tbsp] 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese [about 1/4 cup] 1. Place
  3 [1] tablespoons of the butter with the oil in a heavy 4-quart
  saucepan or casserole over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook,
  stirring, for about 3 minutes, until it begins to soften. Add the
  rice and stir well, using a wooden spoon, to combine. Add the wine
  all at once and cook, stirring, until it is mostly absorbed by the
  rice, about a minute or two. [I now add the sun dried tomatoes and
  the first addition of broth] 2. Begin to add the broth, about 3/4 cup
  at a time, stirring well until each addition of broth has been
  absorbed by the rice. Continue to add the broth, stirring, until the
  rice is tender but firm, al dente, about 20 minutes. [add about 1/2
  cup at a time- I also usually put the peas in the broth so they'll
  cook while the rice is cooking. Don't add peas to the rice until the
  end, though] 3. Turn off the heat and stir in one last addition of
  broth, the remaining butter, the sun-dried tomatoes, peas, goat
  cheese, and Parmesan until the cheeses melt and are incorporated into
  the rice. Serve immediately. [I save only about 2-3 Tbsp broth to
  stir in at the end]

  keep it simmering for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. The meat should be

  Peel and cube eggplants. Soak in cold salted water. Drain and cook in
  large Dutch oven in bacon fat for 1 hour over medium heat; then add
  salt, red pepper, onions, bell pepper and celery. Continue cooking
  until thoroughly done. We use a potato masher to break up eggplant
  while cooking. If using fresh shrimp, cook additional 10 minutes. If
  lump crabmeat (or ham) is used, stir in without cooking. Add enough
  seasoned bread crumbs to absorb liquid. Stir in 1/2 cup Romano cheese
  (Grated cheese refrigerates well in jar). Place in 2 quart casserole
  and top lightly with more crumbs and cheese. Bake at 350 degrees for
  30 minutes. Hungry? Enjoy. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On

  From : Sallie Krebs, Sat 06 Aug 95 04:00, Area: COOKING
  
  Iowa State Fair cookout champion Gary Kuper of Adel, Iowa (12 miles
  west of Des Moines), sent us his prizewinning recipe. Gary rolls
  together beef round steak, bacon and ham for an irresistible
  marinated trio.
  
  1. For marinade, combine the 1/2 cup cooking oil, vinegar or lemon
  juice, 2 cloves garlic and pepper. Place beef steak in a plastic bag;
  set into a shallow dish. Pour marinade over meat. Seal bag. Chill
  meat for 12 to 24 hours, turning bag occasionally.
  
  2. Meanwhile, prepare sauce: In a small saucepan, combine the 1/4 cup
  cooking oil, butter and 2 gloves garlic. Cook over low heat till
  butter is melted. Remove from heat; whisk in sour cream. Set the
  sauce aside.
  
  3. Drain the meat, discarding the marinade. Cut the beef into strips
  that are about 6 inches long by 3/4 inch wide.
  
  4. Using the same number of strips of bacon as there are strips of
  beef, cook bacon in a large skillet till bacon is cooked, but not
  crisp.
  
  5. Cut ham into 6x3/4-inch strips.
  
  6. For each roll, place a strip of beef atop a bacon strip. Place 1
  or 2 strips of ham atop each beef strip. Beginning at short side of
  stack, roll up meat. Thread rolls onto skewers, leaving 1/4 inch
  between each.
  
  7. In a covered grill, arrange medium-hot coals around a drip pan.
  Test for medium heat above drip pan. Place kabobs on the grill rack

  the green pepper, half of the onion and half of the cheese. Top with
  remaining potatoes, green pepper and onion. Sprinkle with seasoned
  salt and pepper. Top with remaining cheese and bacon: Dot with
  butter, if you like.

  Iowa lake not far from the Clay County Fair. "I don't use mixers or
  microwaves or bread machines." But you can use your mixer for this
  honey-sweetened loaf.
  
  Ground cinnamon
  
  1. In large mixing bowl, combine the 2 cups boiling water, oats,
  honey, butter or margarine and salt. Set aside to cool.
  
  2. In a small bowl, soften yeast in the 1/2 cup warm water, stirring
  with a spoon to mix. Let stand for 10 to 15 minutes.
  
  3. When oatmeal mixture has cooled to lukewarm, stir in the yeast
  mixture.
  
  4. Add the 2 cups whole-wheat flour and beat till smooth.
  
  5. Add the bread flour, 1 cup at a time, mixing thoroughly. When the
  dough becomes too thick to mix with a spoon, knead by hand on a
  lightly floured surface. Add enough flour to make a moderately stiff
  dough that's smooth and elastic.
  
  6. Shape dough into a ball. Place in a bowl sprayed with non-stick
  coating. Spray top of dough with non-stick coating. Cover with some
  waxed paper and let dough rise in a warm place till it's doubled in
  size (for about 1 hour).
  
  7. Punch dough down. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and
  divide in half. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
  
  8. Roll out each half of dough on a floured surface to about a
  12x9-inch rectangle. Sprinkle generously with half of the 1 teaspoon
  cinnamon and half of the raisins. Roll up dough from short side.
  Pinch edges and ends closed.
  
  9. Place in a greased 8x4x2-inch loaf pan. Repeat with remaining
  dough, cinnamon and raisins, and another 8x4x2-inch loaf pan.
  
  10. Cover dough with waxed paper and let rise in a warm place till
  about 1/2 inch above the edge of the pan to form rounded loaves (25
  to 30 minutes).
  
  11. Spray the loaves with non-stick coating and sprinkle with
  cinnamon.
  
  12. Bake in a 350-F oven for 35 to 40 minutes or till done. Cover
  loosely with foil for the last 10 minutes, if necessary. Remove from
  pans; cool completely on wire racks. Makes 2 loaves.

    3/4 c  Water
      3 tb Vinegar
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Butter or margarine
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
    3/4 ts Garlic salt
    3/4 ts Pepper
 
  1 3/4-    to 1-pound pork tenderloin
  
  From : Sallie Krebs, Sat 06 Aug 95 04:00, Area: COOKING
  
  One secret of this cookout recipe from Pat and Jeryl Hochstedler of
  Goshen, Indiana, is their method of "injecting" the meat using a
  special cooking syringe. We revised their recipe so you can baste the
  tenderloin with Pat and Jeryl's savory sauce, a winner at the Elkhart
  County Fair.
  
  1. For the basting sauce, in a small saucepan, stir together all
  ingredients, except the pork.
  
  2. In a covered grill, arrange medium-hot coals around a drip pan.
  Test for medium heat above the pan. Place tenderloin on the grill
  rack over drip pan, but not over coals.
  
  3. Insert a meat thermometer. Baste meat with sauce. Lower the grill
  hood.
  
  4. Grill the meat for about 30 to 45 minutes or till a thermometer
  registers 160-F to 170-F, brushing frequently with sauce. Store the
  remaining basting sauce in the refrigerator. Bring the sauce to
  boiling before using it again.

      1 c  Boiling water
      1 pk Active dry yeast
      1 c  Warm water (105-F to 115-F)
      2 tb Honey

  Determining how brown her baked goods get in the oven is one of the
  toughest baking tasks, explains Vera Brandt of Holstein, Iowa. The
  Clay County Fair winner is blind. Get out the butter and jam to
  slather on generous slices of this home-style white bread.
  
  1. In a small mixing bowl, combine potato flakes and boiling water;
  mix well. Set aside for about 15 to 20 minutes or till lukewarm
  (120-F to 130 F).
  
  2. Lightly grease two 8x4x2-inch loaf pans or 9x5x3-inch loaf pans;
  set the pans aside.
  
  3. In a large bowl, soften yeast in the 1 cup warm water, stirring
  with a spoon to mix. Add honey and salt.
  
  4. Add the lukewarm potatoes to the yeast mixture. Add the beaten egg
  and stir the mixture well.
  
  5. Add as much flour as you can, about a cup at a time, mixing well
  by hand after each addition.
  
  6. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough of the
  remaining flour to make a moderately stiff dough that's smooth and
  elastic (6 to 8 minutes total). Shape into a ball.
  
  7. Place dough in a lightly greased bowl; turn once to grease surface.
  Cover and let rise in a warm place till doubled (about 45 to 60
  minutes).
  
  8. Punch the dough down. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured
  surface. Divide the dough in half. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
  
  9. Shape each half of the dough into a loaf. Place in prepared pans.
  Cover and let rise in a warm place till nearly doubled (30 to 40
  minutes).
  
  10. Bake in a 375-F oven for 30 to 35 minutes or till bread sounds
  hollow when tapped. Cover loosely with foil for last 10 minutes to
  prevent overbrowning, if necessary. Remove from pans and cool on wire
  racks.

      Title: Basic Easy Crust
 Categories: Pie/tart
      Yield: 2 -9" crusts
 
      3 c  All-purpose Flour
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Margarine
    1/2 c  Crisco
      1    Egg
      1 tb White Vinegar
      3 tb Ice Water, increase to 4
           - tablespoons if necessary
 
  In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Using a pastry
  blender, cut in the margarine and shortening. Keep working the flour
  and shortening until the mixture is rather grainy, like coarse
  cornmeal.
  
  Mix the egg and vinegar together and, using a wooden fork, stir the
  mixture into the flour.  Add enough of the ice water so that the
  dough barely holds together. Place on a marble pastry board or a
  plastic countertop and knead for just a few turns, enough so that the
  dough holds together and becomes rollable.
  
  Jeff Smith, The Frugal Gourmet, says: "I roll out my dough on a piece
  of waxed paper.  It is easy to handle that way. If you have a marble
  rolling pin, the rolling out will be easy. If you use a wooden one,
  be sure to dust a teaspoon of flour on it a couple of times when you
  are rolling out the dough."

      2 lb Veal scallops, sliced 1/4"
           -thick, pounded thin
           -Salt & Freshly ground
           -pepper
           -Fresh sage, dried sage or
           -ground sage
    1/2 lb Thin slices of prosciutto,
           -Flour
      4 tb Butter
      1 c  Marsala or dry white wine
    1/2 c  Hot beef bouillon
 
  Trim the veal scallops so that they are approximately all the same
  size. (Save trimmings for sauces.)  Sprinkle a little salt and pepper
  on each slice of meat.  Place 2 or more leaves of fresh or dried sage
  on each veal slice, or sprinkle about a scant 1/4 teaspoon ground
  sage on each. Cut prosciutto to the same size as veal slices.  Top
  each veal slice with a prosciutto slice.  Roll up and secure with
  toothpicks or tie with kitchen thread.  Coat each veal roll lightly
  with flour, shaking off excess flour. Divide butter between 2 large
  frying pans; heat it  without browning. Over medium heat, cook veal
  rolls about 5 minutes, or until golden brown on all sides.  Reduce
  heat and add 1/2 cup marsala  and 1/4 cup beef bouillon to each
  frying pan.  Cover frying pans and  cook for 5 to 10 minutes longer;
  cooking time depends on the size and  thickness of the rolls. Shake
  the pans frequently to prevent sticking.  If necessary, add a little
  more beef bouillon; there should be 1 to 2  tablespoons sauce for
  each veal bird. Transfer the cooked veal birds  to a heated serving
  dish and spoon the sauce over them.  Serve  immediately and very hot
  with a tossed green salad.  6 servings.

      2    OR 3 lemons Juice
      3 tb Chopped parsley
      2    Garlic cloves - chopped
      2 tb Capers
 
  Place scaloppine between 2 pieces of waxed paper and pound until
  thin. When pounding meat do not use a straight up-and-down movement.
  Use a sliding action so meat is stretched more than flattened (I use
  the edge of a saucer for this).  Coat meat lightly with flour.
  Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Melt 3 tablespoons butter with oil in
  a large heavy skillet. When butter foams, add veal.  Cook over high
  heat about 1 minute on each side. Veal should be light golden outside
  and pink inside. Place veal on a warm platter.  Add 1 tablespoon
  butter and lemon juice to skillet. Deglaze skillet by stirring to
  disolve meat juices attached to bottom of skillet. Stir in parsley,
  garlic and capers. Taste and adjust sauce for seasoning, then spoon
  over veal. Serve immediately. Submitted By CAROLE CRONAN   On

 Categories: Can/preserv, Desserts, Fruit
      Yield: 2 quarts
 
      3 lb Fresh apricots
  2 1/2 c  ;Water
    1/2 c  Anisette
      2 c  Sugar
      4    6" sprigs fresh green or

 Categories: Can/preserv, Desserts, Fruit
      Yield: 2 quarts
 
  2 1/2 c  Fresh plums
  2 1/2 c  Plum wine
  1 1/2 c  ;Water
      2 c  Sugar
      6    3" sprigs fresh rosemary
 
  Wash and dry the plums, then prick each one several times with a
  toothpick or skewer.
  
  Combine the plum wine, water, sugar and two rosemary sprigs in a
  nonreactive pan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently,
  until the mixture boils and sugar is dissolved.  Remove the pan from
  the heat, cover, and let steep for 30 minutes.
  
  Prepare the jars, lids and boiling-water bath.  Remove the rosemary
  and bring the liquid to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring
  occasionally. Fill each hot, dry jar with plums and two rosemary
  sprigs, leaving 1/2" headspace.  Pour the liquid over the fruit until

  Oster writes: "Use small sweet plums for this dish.  The plum wine is
  a Japanese sweet wine that is usually found in liquor stores near the
  sake. The resinous quality of the rosemary keeps this dessert from
  being cloying. To serve, warm the plums and spoon vanilla ice cream
  over them."

      Yield: 2 servings
 
           HOW IS SPAM MADE?
           =================
           *

MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
        x  Chopped pork shoulder meat
        x  A bit of ham added
        x  Salt
        x  Water
        x  Sugar
        x  Sodium Nitrate
 
  There isn't really much scary meat in it, such as the stories about
  pig snouts and such, even though meat used for canning contains
  adjacent fat and connective tissues that need not be described on the
  label, however. Presence of tendons in canned meat is considered
  permissible if the amount is under 10% in contents; the reason being
  that finely ground tendons are believed to be digestible in the
  presence of other proteins. For every 100 pounds of this meat, you
  need about 3 1/2 pounds of salt, a pound of sugar, and about an ounce
  of sodium nitrate. Nitrate is what gives Spam it's eerie
  pink++without it, Spam would fade to a drab meat-loaf gray. The
  consistency of Spam is not quite fleshlike, being too rubbery for
  that, and is constructed on the principle of concrete. Coarse chunks
  of meat are held together by a pate of finely ground meat.
  Approximately 3/4 of the meat is ground coarsely (through a
  three-eighths-inch plate of the grinder), the remaining quarter
  finely (one-eighth-inch plate). Grinding, mixing and curing must be
  done in achilled factory (34 degrees Fahrenheit) to minimize
  bacterial growth. Mix the 2 grades of meat with the salt, sugar, and
  sodium nitrate in a vacuum mixer set to a 27-inch vacuum, for 5
  minutes. Release vacuum and let the mixture cure overnight,
  maintaining refrigeration. The next day, mix in the vacuum mixer for
  about 10 minutes again. The chilled meat is then ready for canning.
  Though the canning plant doesn't have to be refrigerated, the meat
  must not warm more than a few degrees (to no more than 40 degrees
  Fahrenheit) in transit. Spray the inner surfacee cans with oil for
  easy removal, then pack with meat mixtuer and seal under a 27-inch
  vacuum. Spam is still raw when canned. Cooking and sterilization take
  place in the sealed can. The time required to sterilize depends on
  the size and shape of the can. The classic 3 7/8" x 3 1/4" x 2 1/8"
  oblong can takes about 70 minutes in an oven set to 230 degrees
  Fahrenheit. The can's sturdy design andinternal vacuum prevent
  explosion. Hormel's dating code is a 5-digit number on the bottom of
  the can, something like F04173, where F encodes the processing plant.
  The first 2 digits represent the month (04 for April), the next two
  are the day (17 is the 17th), and the last is the year (3 means it's
  1993 unless it's a really old can). There is a record of canned meat
  (not Spam, obviously) remaining edible for 114 years. However, a
  Hormel brochure suggests using all canned foods within 2 years. Says
  Hormel, "It is important to keep in mind that all foods are
  substances which arderived from living matter. All living things have
  life spans that are characteristic of the species. " Even Spam.

      Title: Spam Wine
 Categories: Meats, Spam, Alcohol
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           SPAM WINE
           =========

MMMMM------------------TO MANUFACTURE SPAM WINE-----------------------
 
  Okay. It's a bit tricky, but it can be done. FIRST off, you've got to
  stop the Spam rotting while it's in the mix. Sterilise the bugger.
  Don't use Milton, it kills the rich taste. Use a half-pint of water
  at a constant temperature of sixty-two degrees, for two hours. Add a
  little alcohol (whisky, vodka, something strong) to the mix half an
  hour before you finish that process. Then blend, blend, blend. Stick
  the water and Spam into the mixer and hit "Frappe". Let that go until
  you have a smooth mix. Pour that into a demijohn. The NEXT step is
  fermentation. Six tablespoons of sugar. A sachet of brewer's yeast.
  Two pints of water. Chuck 'em in. Swirl. Bung a cork in it and wait
  two weeks - remember, keep the mixture at twenty-four degrees. When
  two weeks have passed, the mixture should have stopped bubbling. Take
  the jar outside before opening it: it whiffs like nothing on earth at
  this stage. Add a splash more of the same alcoholic beverage you used
  earlier. Swirl. Add another pint of water. Swirl again. Bung and
  leave to settle for twenty-four hours. Decant the mix into a
  sterilised Demijohn, transferring all the solids, and heat briefly to
  fifty-five. All temperatures, incidentally, are in degrees Celsius.
  Proceed with caution now. Add two ounces of charcoal powder and allow
  to settle. That takes out the fusel oil that forms. Decant again. Add
  a liquid made from the jelly of one tin of Spam and a half-pint of
  water, and another two spoons of sugar. This adds flavour. Another
  splash of the same alcholic beverage. Let that sit. If any sediment
  settles to the bottom, you need to reflux the mix with a bit of heat,
  not letting any fumes escape by employing a water-cooled exit tube.
  Decant into bottles and lay down for about a month. The result: Spam
  wine. Incidentally, some notes on which beverage to splash the mix
  with: whisky gives the Spam wine a slightly smoky aftertaste and a
  lingering warmth. Vodka gives a clean, crip taste. Brandy adds a
  classy overtone, redolent of autumn pastures. Pernod tastes foul.
  Spam wine is best enjoyed slightly chilled, but be warned. It has a
  kick like a squadron of highly-trained combat mules and your breath
  will be flammable enough to launch you intercontinental. ON NO
  ACCOUNT LIGHT FART-FLARES AFTER AN EVENING OF SPAM WINE DRINKING. I
  WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RESULTANT PROPERTY DAMAGE OR
  NUCLEAR FALLOUT. Consider yourselves warned. Spam wine is a real
  booze-hound's drink. Drinking etiquette. Spam wine is passed to the
  right. It is drunk from heavy-based spirit glasses - anything else
  corrodes too fast. No larger than a half-pint measure, or you risk it
  reaching critical mass. The first sip should be downed straight to
  avoid damaging the mucous membranes. After hat, savour the flavour.
  No Ice, on any account. It mixes well with tonic water, or cement
  powder. Sprinkling pepper on the top of the liquid and allowing it to
  settle gives a spicier, more fiery taste. AVOID CAYENNE POWDER.
  Finally, after an evening of Spam wine drinking, ensure the buckets
  are nearby. And have a chilled toilet roll in the bog. From:

  Everything you always wanted to know about Pho and more!
  
  WHAT IS PHO?
  
  Pho, also known as Hanoi Beef Soup, is a popular Vietnamese soup. In
  America, Pho is eaten as either lunch, dinner, or just an afternoon
  snack. Traditionally though, in Vietnam, Pho is eaten for breakfast.
  
  WHAT SHOULD I GET IN MY PHO?
  
  When ordering Pho, you will usually have a variety of types to choose
  from. Pho can be gotten with meatballs, ground beef, bible tripe,
  beef tripe, soft tendon, brisket, and a variety of other tasty
  things. And if none of those sound appealing to you, you can always
  get your Pho plain. Well, not exactly plain, you don't eat your Pho
  just like that. It is customary to add Mint leaves, bean
  sprouts,lemon and lime juice, plum sauce and jalepeno sauce to your
  bowl of Pho as well. Therefore, everyone's Pho is unique to
  themselves and their individual taste. For hundreds of years now,
  Vietnamese families have been having Pho for dinner. Now, we are
  fortunate enough to have a multitude of Pho restaurants so we too can
  enjoy Pho. Below, you can see a Vietnamese family travelling miles to
  the marketplace most likely to buy ingredients for Pho.
  
  DOES PHO HAVE NAY NUTRITIONAL VALUE?
  
  Pho actually has a lot of nutritional value. It is made from only all
  natural, home grown ingredients. In ancient times, Pho was given to
  the sick in order to remedy them. It is believed that Pho has many
  beneficial values and is therefore eaten a lot.
  
  BUT HOW DO I PRONOUNCE PHO?
  
  In America, many people like to ignore the accent and pronounce it
  Pho. This is incorrect and may be insulting if heard by someone
  Vietnamese. When pronouncing Pho, don't forget that's an o, not an o.
  If that doesn't help, it is kind of pronounced like "fuh".
  
  THE TAO OF PHo
  
  Many philosophers have attempted to relate Pho to everyday life. The
  most common theory about Pho and Life was written down hundreds of
  years ago on parchment by an unknown philosopher.
  
  He said the following:
  
  Life is like a big bowl of Pho. It is constantly surprising you with
  things unexpected. When you get meatballs, it means you are having
  rocky times. When you get beef tripe, you are having trouble
  internally with your emotions.
  
  BUT WHERE CAN I FIND PHO?
  
  Unfortunately, no one has made Pho in a can yet. So, in order to find
  Pho it would help if you live in a big city or an area with a large
  Vietnamese population. Check your local Yellow Pages for the Pho
  nearest you!
  
  If you would like to taste a bowl of Pho, here's a recipe on how to
  make it!

  apricot vinegar for the apricot-maple sauce. You can buy yours at a
  specialty food shop or use a purchased fruit vinegar.
  
  1. For meat: In a large skillet, partially cook bacon over medium
  heat. Cut the pork tenderloin into 1 1/2-inch slices. Wrap a slice of
  bacon around each piece of pork. Thread wrapped meat onto skewers.
  Or, if you like, fasten bacon to meat with wooden toothpicks before
  threading onto skewers.
  
  2. In a covered grill, arrange medium-hot coals around a drip pan.
  Test for medium heat above pan. Place kabobs on a grill rack over
  drip pan. Lower hood and grill for about 20 to 22 minutes, turning
  once, or till a thermometer; inserted into meat registers 160-F.
  
  3. Meanwhile, prepare Apricot-Maple Sauce: In a medium saucepan, cook

  allspice and pepper. Carefully add the Grand Marnier or other liqueur
  or juice. Bring mixture to a boil; reduce heat and simmer for 8 to 10
  minutes or till thickened. Add maple syrup and heat through.
  
  4. Remove meat from skewers. Serve immediately with warm Apricot-Maple
  Sauce.

  Iowa State Fair cookout champion Gary Kuper of Adel, Iowa (12 miles
  west of Des Moines), sent us his prizewinning recipe. Gary rolls
  together beef round steak, bacon and ham for an irresistible
  marinated trio.
  
  1. For marinade, combine the 1/2 cup cooking oil, vinegar or lemon
  juice, 2 cloves garlic and pepper. Place beef steak in a plastic bag;
  set into a shallow dish. Pour marinade over meat. Seal bag. Chill
  meat for 12 to 24 hours, turning bag occasionally.
  
  2. Meanwhile, prepare sauce: In a small saucepan, combine the 1/4 cup
  cooking oil, butter and 2 gloves garlic. Cook over low heat till
  butter is melted. Remove from heat; whisk in sour cream. Set the
  sauce aside.
  
  3. Drain the meat, discarding the marinade. Cut the beef into strips
  that are about 6 inches long by 3/4 inch wide.
  
  4. Using the same number of strips of bacon as there are strips of
  beef, cook bacon in a large skillet till bacon is cooked, but not
  crisp.
  
  5. Cut ham into 6x3/4-inch strips.
  
  6. For each roll, place a strip of beef atop a bacon strip. Place 1
  or 2 strips of ham atop each beef strip. Beginning at short side of
  stack, roll up meat. Thread rolls onto skewers, leaving 1/4 inch
  between each.
  
  7. In a covered grill, arrange medium-hot coals around a drip pan.
  Test for medium heat above drip pan. Place kabobs on the grill rack
  over the drip pan. Brush with some of the sauce. Lower the grill hood
  and grill for 15 to 20 minutes or till meat is of desired doneness,
  turning and brushing with sauce once.

  divide in half. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
  
  8. Roll out each half of dough on a floured surface to about a
  12x9-inch rectangle. Sprinkle generously with half of the 1 teaspoon
  cinnamon and half of the raisins. Roll up dough from short side.
  Pinch edges and ends closed.
  
  9. Place in a greased 8x4x2-inch loaf pan. Repeat with remaining
  dough, cinnamon and raisins, and another 8x4x2-inch loaf pan.
  
  10. Cover dough with waxed paper and let rise in a warm place till
  about 1/2 inch above the edge of the pan to form rounded loaves (25
  to 30 minutes).
  
  11. Spray the loaves with non-stick coating and sprinkle with
  cinnamon.
  
  12. Bake in a 350-F oven for 35 to 40 minutes or till done. Cover
  loosely with foil for the last 10 minutes, if necessary. Remove from
  pans; cool completely on wire racks. Makes 2 loaves.

    3/4 c  Water
      3 tb Vinegar
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Butter or margarine
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
    3/4 ts Garlic salt
    3/4 ts Pepper
 
  1 3/4-    to 1-pound pork tenderloin
  
  From : Sallie Krebs, Sat 06 Aug 95 04:00, Area: COOKING
  
  One secret of this cookout recipe from Pat and Jeryl Hochstedler of
  Goshen, Indiana, is their method of "injecting" the meat using a
  special cooking syringe. We revised their recipe so you can baste the
  tenderloin with Pat and Jeryl's savory sauce, a winner at the Elkhart
  County Fair.
  
  1. For the basting sauce, in a small saucepan, stir together all
  ingredients, except the pork.
  
  2. In a covered grill, arrange medium-hot coals around a drip pan.
  Test for medium heat above the pan. Place tenderloin on the grill
  rack over drip pan, but not over coals.
  
  3. Insert a meat thermometer. Baste meat with sauce. Lower the grill
  hood.
  
  4. Grill the meat for about 30 to 45 minutes or till a thermometer
  registers 160-F to 170-F, brushing frequently with sauce. Store the
  remaining basting sauce in the refrigerator. Bring the sauce to
  boiling before using it again.

      1 c  Boiling water
      1 pk Active dry yeast
      1 c  Warm water (105-F to 115-F)
      2 tb Honey

  Determining how brown her baked goods get in the oven is one of the
  toughest baking tasks, explains Vera Brandt of Holstein, Iowa. The
  Clay County Fair winner is blind. Get out the butter and jam to
  slather on generous slices of this home-style white bread.
  
  1. In a small mixing bowl, combine potato flakes and boiling water;
  mix well. Set aside for about 15 to 20 minutes or till lukewarm
  (120-F to 130 F).
  
  2. Lightly grease two 8x4x2-inch loaf pans or 9x5x3-inch loaf pans;
  set the pans aside.
  
  3. In a large bowl, soften yeast in the 1 cup warm water, stirring
  with a spoon to mix. Add honey and salt.
  
  4. Add the lukewarm potatoes to the yeast mixture. Add the beaten egg
  and stir the mixture well.
  
  5. Add as much flour as you can, about a cup at a time, mixing well
  by hand after each addition.
  
  6. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough of the
  remaining flour to make a moderately stiff dough that's smooth and
  elastic (6 to 8 minutes total). Shape into a ball.
  
  7. Place dough in a lightly greased bowl; turn once to grease surface.
  Cover and let rise in a warm place till doubled (about 45 to 60
  minutes).
  
  8. Punch the dough down. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured
  surface. Divide the dough in half. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes.
  
  9. Shape each half of the dough into a loaf. Place in prepared pans.
  Cover and let rise in a warm place till nearly doubled (30 to 40
  minutes).
  
  10. Bake in a 375-F oven for 30 to 35 minutes or till bread sounds
  hollow when tapped. Cover loosely with foil for last 10 minutes to
  prevent overbrowning, if necessary. Remove from pans and cool on wire
  racks.

      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 tb Wine or Sherry
      3    Eggs, beaten
           Oil for frying

    1/2 ts Sugar

MMMMM----------------------CHINESE PANCAKES---------------------------
      2 c  Flour
    3/4 c  Boiling water
           Sesame oil
 
  Make the pancakes by placing the flour in a bowl and making a well in
  the center.  Add water, stirring quickly with a fork until a dough
  has formed. It shouldn't be too sticky and you may not need all the
  water. Turn dough onto lightly floured board, knead until smooth,
  adding more flour if necessary.  Place dough in bowl and cover. Allow
  to rest 30 min.
   Moisten hands with oil.  Pull off plum sized pieces and flatten.
  Brush each ball with oil. Roll ball into a 6 inch circle. Repeat with
  all dough. Fry each pancake until 1 side puffs up. Turn and repeat on
  other side. Let cool.
  
  Marinate pork one hour. in cornstarch, salt, pepper, sherry and enough
  beaten egg to moisten it.  Heat wok, add oil. Stir fry pork and
  slightly beaten eggs, stirring so pieces separate.  Once eggs form
  themselves into curds, remove and set aside. Add more oil to the wok
  and lightly brown garlic. Add all vegetables, stir frying until just
  cooked, about 3-4 min. Return meat and eggs to vegetables, add 2 ts
  hoisin sauce, soy sauce, sugar, salt and pepper.  Combine well. In a
  steamer, re-heat the pancakes. Spread each Chinese pancake with
  hoisin sauce. Add a good 2 T of filling to bottom 1/2 of each pancake
  and roll up like crepes.  Serve.
  
  Source: I forget the name of the cookbook since it was before I
  started keeping track of where a recipe came from, and I've since
  given the book away, but it had all chinese recipes in it.

      Title: Marinated Thai Beef
 Categories: Bbq/grill, Main dish, Thai, Hot/spicy, Meats
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2 ea Strip loin steaks 6 oz. ea.
      1    Lemon grass stalk
      1    Lime leaf
      1    Garlic clove
      2    Scallions
      1 ts Sugar
      1 ts Chili paste
      1 ts Curry powder, hot or mild
      1 ts Tumeric
    1/2    Hot red pepper, chopped
    1/2 c  Thick coconut milk
           Salt to taste

MMMMM-------------------------VEGETABLES------------------------------
           Mushrooms
           Snow peas
           Red or green pepper
           Cabbage
           Celery
           Green onions
 
  Coarsely chop the lemon grass and lime leaf. Peel the garlic and
  onions and chop. Add these plus the spices and the red pepper to a
  food processor. Pour in the coconut milk and blend to a thick paste.
  (If you can't find thick coconut milk, use regular but pour off and
  save the thin liquid on top and use the thick cream on the bottom of
  the can.)
  
  Spread the marinade on both sides of the steaks. It should be like a
  crust on the meat. Let stand in the fridge for 3 hours to overnight.
  Save the remaining marinade.
  
  Grill the steaks on a hot grill to medium (or as desired). While the
  steaks are grilling, stir-fry a selection of veggies in a wok until
  tender crisp. Remove veggies and keep warm. Add the saved marinade to
  the wok and add the remaining coconut milk or the thin liquid poured
  off the top. Simmer until slightly reduced, or if too thick add a
  little water or fish sauce. Salt to taste, and return the veggies to
  the wok; stir to coat.
  
  Slice the meat across the grain into 1/2" slices. Arrange on top of
  hot steamed rice or rice noodles. Top with veggies and sauce. Garnish
  with a small dollop of chili paste if desired.
  
  The tumeric gives this dish a wonderful bright yellow color. You can
  substitute chicken breasts or pork steaks for the strip loin.

      Yield: 1 recipe
 
           Corn, as necessary

MMMMM------------------------BASTING OIL-----------------------------
    1/4 c  Olive oil
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      1 tb Sweet Hungarian paprika
      1 pn Cayenne
      1 ts Whole cumin seeds, lightly
           -- crushed in a mortar &
           -- pestle
           Salt & pepper, as necessary
 
  Use only unhusked corn.  Soak in water for at least 30 minutes.
  Prepare either a grill or preheat an oven to 375F.
  
  While the corn is soaking, whisk together all the basting
  ingredients. When the corn has soaked for 30 minutes, carefully peel
  back the husks & remove the silk.  Do not remove the husks entirely.
  Using a pastry brush, brush the oil over the corn.  Close up the
  husks & tie them closed. You need to ensure that the corn is well
  wrapped otherwise it will dry out as it grills.
  
  Place on grill & grill for 15 minutes, turning frequently.  If you do
  not turn the corn, it will burn.  Or, bake in the middle of the
  preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes.  Remove husks & serve
  immediately. Or let cool & refrigerate & serve as part of a salad
  buffet.

  * 3 ounces of cooked meat is about the size of a deck of playing
  cards.
  
  Before cooking, trim away excess fat using a sharp knife.
  
  Tender Tips and a Freebie: Long cooking over low heat helps tenderize
  lean cuts.  Stews are ideal made with chunks of round steak - just
  remember to use plenty of liquid and keep the lid on the pot.
  
  Marinating also helps tenderize.  Always include an acid (Vinegar
  orlemon juice) in marinade and marinate at least 6 hours.  Grill
  quickly, being careful not to overcook.

    1/2 c  Mung dal
    1/2 sm Cabbage; chopped fine
      1 lg Baking potato, diced
      1 bn Frozen peas
      1 ts Sambar powder
           Turmeric; to taste

           Dry red chilli; (seasoning)
           Curry leaves; (seasoning)
           Oil; (seasoning)
 
  Set dal to cook in about 2 cups water and a touch turmeric. When dal
  is three-quarters done add shredded cabbage, potatoes and a little
  more water if needed on top of the dal. Add sambar powder and salt.
  
  Cover with a lid and let it simmer away another 10 to 15 minutes.
  Veggies should be done but still holding their shape. Stir in wet
  coconut. Remove from heat. Top with seasoning as explained in
  previous recipes.
  
  If more particular, grind fresh coconut with roasted red chilli and
  roasted urad dal paste in lieu of the desiccated coconut.
  
  Variations:
  
  You can do a keerai (spinach) kootan with a little modification. Add
  fresh coconut ground with roasted red chillies, urad dal and a little
  cumin. Also you can cook toovar dal separately or throw veggies + dal
  in a cooker for a few minutes, if you like. This tends to overcook
  veggies but can be done fast.

      Yield: 8 servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1    Stalk fresh lemon grass or
      1 tb Dried
  3 1/2 ts Curry powder
           Fresh ground black pepper
      1 ts Sugar
      4 ts Salt
      3 lb Chicken, cut up
      7 tb Vegetable oil
      3    Sweet potatoes or
      3    White potatoes, peeled and
           -cubed
      4    Cloves garlic, chopped
      3    Bay leaves
      1 lg Onion, cut into wedges,
           -separated
      2 c  Water
      1    Carrot, 2-inch slices
      2 c  Coconut milk
      1 c  Milk or water *
 
  * If you use canned coconut milk, you must use water.
  
  This is a real Vietnamese curry. Although adapted from the Indian,
  which is always made with white potatoes, the Vietnamese version has
  the option of using white or sweet potatoes, the latter being greatly
  favored by the Vietnamese. The Indian in- fluence is greatest in the
  South, where curried dishes are more popular than elsewhere in
  Vietnam.
  
  This is usually served with noodles as a party dish. When it is part
  of a family meal, it is eaten with rice. Bach serves this to her
  children for breakfast, when it is served with French bread--another
  influence on the cuisine of Vietnam.
  
  If you are using fresh lemon grass, simply remove the outer leaves and
  upper two-thirds of the stalks, then cut the remainder into 2-inch
  lengths. If you are, using, it must be soaked in warm water for 2
  hours, then drained and chopped fine.
  
  Combine the curry powder, black pepper, sugar, add salt and marinate
  the chicken in the mixture for at least 1 hour. Heat the oil and fry
  the potatoes over high heat until brown. (It is not necessary to
  completely cook potatoes at this point, only to brown them.) When
  well browned, remove from the pan and set aside until ready to cook
  the curry. Pour off most of the oil from the pan, leaving 2
  tablespoons for cooking the chicken.
  
  Heat 2 tablespoons oil over a high flame. Fry the garlic for a few
  seconds, then add the bay leaves, onion, and lemon grass; stir
  briefly and add the marinated chicken, stirring long enough to sear
  the meat slightly. Add the 2 cups of water and carrot, then cover and
  bring to a boil. Turn the heat down and simmer for 5 minutes; uncover
  and stir, then cook, covered, for another 10 minutes. Remove the
  cover and add the prefried potatoes, the coconut milk, and the milk.
  Cover again and simmer another 15 minutes. Serve with rice, Rice
  Sticks, or Japanese Alimentary Paste Noodles.

      Title: Doh Piaza (Spiced Lamb with Onions)
 Categories: Indian, Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 8 servings
 
  1 1/2 kg Shoulder of lamb or mutton
      1 kg Onions
      6    Cloves garlic
  1 1/2 ts Finely grated fresh ginger
      3 tb Yoghurt
      2 ts Chilli powder
      1 ts Paprika
      3 tb Chopped fresh coriander
           Leaves
      2 tb Ground coriander
      2 ts Black cummin seeds
      3 tb Ghee
      3 tb Oil
      8    Cardamon pods
      1 ts Garam masala
 
  Cut meat into large cubes.  Slice half the onions finely and chop the
  rest. Put the chopped onions into container of electric blender with
  garlic, ginger, yoghurt, chilli powder, paprika, coriander leaves,
  ground coriander and black cummin seeds.  Blend until smooth.
  
  Heat ghee and oil in a large heavy pan and fry the sliced onions,
  stirring frequently, until evenly browned.  Remove from pan.  Add
  cubed meat to pan, not too many pieces at one time, and fry on high
  heat until browned on all sides.  Remove each batch as it is browned
  and add more.  When all the meat has been done and removed from pan,
  add a little more ghee or oil if necessary and fry the blended
  mixture over medium heat, stirring all the time, until it is cooked
  and gives out an aromatic smell.  Oil should start to appear around
  the edges of mixture.  Return meat to pan, add cardamon pods, stir
  well, cover and cook on low heat until meat is almost tender. Sir
  occasionally.  It might be necessary to add a little water, but
  usually the juices given out by the meat are sufficient.  When meat
  is tender and liquid almost absorbed add garam masala and reserved
  fried onions, replace lid af pan and leave on very low heat for a
  further 15 minutes.
  
  Serve with rice or Indian bread.

  These vegetables should be tender yet still have bite. As they tend

  convenience, steam the vegetables ahead of time, then roast them just
  before serving.
  
  1. Preheat oven to 450'F.
  
  2. Steam vegetables separately (do beets last) until tender, about 10
  minutes for each; remove to a bowl.
  
  3. Gently toss the vegetables with olive oil, thyme, salt and pepper.
  (Do not overtoss, lest the beets bleed; just shake the bowl.)
  
  4. Place the vegetables in one layer on two large baking sheets and
  bake for 30 minutes or until nicely colored and fork-tender, shaking
  occasionally. Serve in the center of the Crown Roast of Pork; serve
  any extra vegetables in bowls around the serving platter.

  Wild rice is a most festive choice for the holidays. Be sure to rinse
  it before use, to wash off dust. It's expensive, so I've added white
  rice to make enough for eight people. - Sheila Lukins
  
  1. Place the dried cherries, raisins and dried apricots in a small
  bowl and cover with boiling water. Let the fruits soak for 30
  minutes. Drain the fruits well; reserve.
  
  2. In a heavy saucepan, bring 5 cups of water to a boil. Add the wild
  rice, reduce heat slightly and cook at a gentle simmer, uncovered,
  for about 40-45 minutes or until rice is just tender. Drain.
  
  3. In another heavy saucepan, bring 2 1/2 cups of water to a boil.
  Add the white rice, reduce heat slightly, cover and simmer for 20
  minutes or until the rice is tender and all of the liquid has been
  absorbed.
  
  4. Heat the oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-low heat. Add the
  onion and cook, stirring, for 5-7 minutes or until wilted. Add nuts,
  if desired, and cook for 2 minutes more, stirring. Remove from heat.
  
  5. Add the drained fruits, the cooked rices, orange zest, orange
  juice and parsley. Season to taste with salt and pepper, fluffing up
  the rice with a fork.

      Title: Cinnamon Brioche
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 20 brioches
 
      1 pk Dry yeast
      1 tb Sugar
    1/4 c  Warm milk (95-105'F.)
      2 c  Flour
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Frozen butter, cut into
           -pieces
      2    Eggs
      2 tb Melted butter
      2 tb Sugar mixed with
      2 ts Cinnamon
 
  This recipe, adapted from the brioche leaf in James Beard's "New
  Recipes for the Cuisinart" (Cuisinarts, 1976), can be varied in many
  ways. Sprinkle raisins over the cinnamon sugar, for example. Or
  sprinkle the rolled-out dough with chocolate chips fold it in the
  same way and you'll end up with a nice pain au chocolat. Or spread
  the dough with any kind of fruit jam ... you get the picture.
  
  Combine yeast, sugar and milk in small bowl. Set aside to proof.
  
  In food processor combine flour, salt and butter and pulse to cut in
  butter finely. Add yeast mixture and pulse again, then add eggs and
  process until dough gathers in ball that comes cleanly away from the
  sides of work bowl and rides around on top of blade. Process 1
  minute. Then remove ball to lightly floured board and knead 1-2
  minutes until smooth.
  
  Form dough in smooth ball and place in lightly oiled bowl, turning to
  coat all sides of ball. Cover loosely with plastic wrap. Set aside in
  warm place to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
  
  Alternatively, place kneaded dough ball in lightly sealed plastic
  food bag and refrigerate overnight. Dough will rise slowly in plastic
  food bag and just need to be brought to room temperature before
  rolling out.
  
  When risen, punch dough down and flatten into rectangle. On lightly
  floured board, roll out to 1/2" thick. If dough is square, cut in
  half. Brush top surface with melted butter and sprinkle with cinnamon
  sugar. Fold long side of dough rectangle 2/3 of way across dough.
  Fold remaining 1/3 of dough over as in letter. Brush top with butter
  and sprinkle again with cinnamon sugar. Cut into 2" wide sections,
  transfer to ungreased baking sheet. Let rise again until puffy, 15-20
  minutes. Bake at 350'F. 20-30 minutes, until light-brown. Makes 18-20
  cinnamon brioches.

  and set aside.
  
  4. To prepare salad, cover bottom of a large platter or shallow bowl
  with lettuce leaves. Arrange potatoes, carrots, avocado, beets and
  pickle - plus eggs and shrimp, if desired - decoratively on top in
  rows, wedges or circles. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and chopped dill.
  Serve dressing in a bowl alongside.
  
  Per serving (without eggs and shrimp): 225 calories, 16 grams fat, 90

  1 1/4 lb Ground beef
    2/3    Stick butter
      1 c  Diced onions
      4    10 oz. boxes of frozen
           -chopped spinach, thawed
      1 cn 28 oz. Progresso Crushed
           -Tomatoes with added puree'
      1 ts (rounded) salt
    1/2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Rice
           -IN_
    1/4 c  Water
 
  Start by putting the 1/2 cup of rice in the 1/4 cup of water.  In a
  one cup measure, this should bring it up to the 3/4 cup mark.
  
  In a large spaghetti pot, brown the meat in its own fat.  Remove the
  meat and pour off the fat.
  
  In that same pot, melt the butter and lightly brown the onions.  When
  done, add the cooked meat.
  
  Add the spinach.
  
  Add the tomato sauce, salt, water, and the water and rice that has
  been soaking.
  
  Mix thoroughly, and then cover and let simmer on a low flame for 1
  hour, stirring every 15 minutes.
  
  If needed, keep juicy by adding a little water or tomato juice.
  
  Serve with yogurt or sour cream and some French bread.
  
  As with other casseroles, it tastes better on the second day.
  
  This original Turkish dish was originally prepared by Ferihah Ceran,
  and passed it down to her daughter-in-law Edith Ceran.  Edith passed
  it down to her sons.  Enjoy.

  In a preheated wok, heat 2 tablespoons oil.  Quickly swirl crushed
  garlic clove over the bottom and sides, then discard.  Add the

  and cook 2 minutes. Add the Chinese Five Spice and stir for 1 minute.
  Serve immediately, over rice.
  
  Having recently visited Shanghai and enjoyed the true Chinese cuisine
  (not the Americanized version), I decided to try and duplicate some
  dishes. Here's one that was successful ;) This is very close to the
  Shanghai style of kung bow chicken.  Each restaurant added it's own
  touches, one even included cooked carrots. The dark soy sauce is
  absolutely required.

  BAKING TECHNIQUES:
  
        SEPARATING EGGS:  Tap the side of the egg on the edge of a bowl
  or cup to crack the shell. Pass the yolk from shell to shell,
  dropping the white into a cup before adding it to the other whites
  called for in the recipe. If a little yolk gets into the whites,
  scoop it out with part of the shell. The presence of any yolk in the
  whites can ruin them.
        BEATING EGG WHITES:  Egg whites may be beaten with an electric
  mixer, rotary egg beater or ballon style whisk.  Bowl and beater must
  be clean and dry because even a small amount of grease or oil can
  prevent the whites from whipping properly. Beat the whites slowly,
  gradually increasing the speed as they begin to foam. Beat only until
  they hold shape or point. CAUTION: Do not beat egg whites ahead of
  time.  They should be folded in immediately after they are beaten.
        WHIPPING CREAM:  Cream may be whipped with electric mixer,
  rotary eggbeater, or ballon style whisk.  Cream, bowl and beaters
  should be very cold for best results. To avoid spattering, beat
  slowly, gradually increasing speed as cream thickens.  CAUTION:  Be
  careful not to over beat as you will end up with butter and
  buttermilk. It is best not to whip cream too far ahead of time or it
  will separate slightly. If this happens, mix briefly with a wire
  whisk.
        FOLDING INGREDIENTS:  Many recipes call for folding beaten egg
  whites or whipped cream into another mixture.  Both egg whites and
  whipped cream contain air in the form of many small bubbles.  Folding
  rather than mixing is done to retain the air in the mixture. Start
  with a large bowl containing the heavier mixture. Using a circular
  motion with a rubber spatula, cut down through center of mixture
  across bottom of bowl, lifting up and over. After each fold, rotate
  the bowl slightly in order to incorporate the ingredients as evenly
  as possible. Fold in remaining egg whites or whipped until uniformly
  but lightly combined.
  
        MEASURING DRY INGREDIENTS:  Use the standard graded sets of
  four: 1/4 cup, 1/3 cup, 1/2 cup, and 1 cup.  Spoon dry ingredients
  into measure and level off with a metal spatula.
  
        MEASURING LIQUID INGREDIENTS:  Use a glass or plastic measuring
  cup with a pour spout.  With the cup sitting on a flat surface, read
  it at eye level.  Fill to exactly to line indicated.
  
  WORDS TO BAKE BY:
  
        BEAT:  to thoroughly combine ingredients and incorporate air
  with a rapid regular motion.  This may be done with a wire whisk,
  rotary eggbeater or an electric mixer.
        BLEND:  To thoroughly combine two or more ingredients.
        CHILL:  To refrigerate until cold.
        CREAM:  To combine two or more ingredients by beating until the
  mixture is light and well blended.
        CUT IN:  To combine solid fat with dry ingredients by using a
  pastry blender or two knives in a scissors motion until particles are
  of the desired size.
        DRIZZLE:  To sprinkle drops of glaze or icing over food in a
  random manner from tines of a fork or the end of a spoon.
        FULL ROLLING BOIL:  To cook a mixture until it appears to rise
  in the pan.  The surface billows rather than just bubbles.
        GLAZE:  To coat with a liquid, a thin icing or a jelly either
  before or after food is cooked.
        MIXING JUST UNTIL MOISTENED:  Combining dry ingredients with
  liquid ingredients until dry ingredients are thoroughly moistened but
  mixture is still lumpy.
        PACKED BROWN SUGAR:  Brown sugar pressed into measuring cup
  with a spoon.  Sugar will hold its shape when cup is inverted.
        SIMMER:  To cook in liquid just below the boiling point.
  Bubbles form slowly just below the surface.
        SOFT PEAKS:  Egg whites or cream beaten to the stage where
  mixture forms soft rounded peaks when beaters are removed.
        STIFF PEAKS:  Egg whites or cream beaten to the stage where
  mixture holds stiff pointed peaks when beaters are removed.

  CHOCOLATE:  ITS CARE & HANDLING
  
     It's no surprise that chocolate is America's favorite flavor.
  However, as a natural product made principally from cocoa beans,
  chocolate does have certain characteristics that affect the way it
  should be stored and used for best results.
  
     STORING CHOCOLATE:  The key words are COOL, DRY, AND LOW HUMIDITY!
  Storage temperature should be between 60 degrees and 78 degrees F.
  with relative humidity at less than 50 %.  It is all right to
  refrigerate chocolate, but wrap it tightly so that it won't absorb
  odors. Airtight wrapping will also prevent moisture from condensing
  on the chocolate when it is removed from the refrigerator.  Chocolate
  becomes hard and brittle when cold, so allow it to come to room
  temperature before using.
  
     A TIP ABOUT MILK CHOCOLATE CHIPS:  Don't use milk chocolate chips
  in desserts that do not call for melting the chips before blending
  them in. The milk content causes them to become hard when they are
  baked. You may substitute milk chocolate chips for semi-sweet chips
  in recipes such as frostings or sauces that call for melting the
  chips.
  
     THERE'S NO LOVE IN "BLOOM," BUT NO HARM EITHER:  Chocolate has a
  high content of cocoa butter.  When stored at temperatures that
  fluctuate from hot to cold, chocolate can develop "bloom"--a gray
  film caused by the cocoa butter rising to the surface.  This dulls
  the rich brown chocolate color but does not affect the flavor.  When
  the chocolate melts, it regains its attractive color. Don't hesitate
  to use it.
  
  MELTING CHOCOLATE PERFECTLY:
  
     IMPORTANT REMINDER:  Even the smallest drop of moisture from a wet
  spoon or steam from a double boiler can cause melted chocolate to
  become lumpy. If this occurs, all is not lost.  Stir in 1 T vegetable
  shortening (not butter) for every 3 ounces of chocolate.  Butter is
  not used because it contains water.  Stir continuously until the
  consistency is smooth and even.
  
     TOP OF STOVE METHOD:  All varieties of chips can be melted using
  this traditional method.  Place the amount of chips you want to melt
  in the top of a clean, dry, double boiler.  Place over hot (not
  boiling) water, stirring occasionally until smooth.  Note: water in
  bottom pan should be 1 inch below top pan for best results.
  
     MICROWAVE METHOD:  All varieties of chips can be melted using a
  microwave oven.  Simply place the amount of chips you want to melt in
  a dry, glass measuring cup twice the size (i.e. to melt 1 cup of
  chips, use a 2 cup measuring cup).  Microwave on HIGH for 1 minute;
  stir. Microwave on HIGH for 30 seconds longer; stir.  It is necessary
  to stir the chips because they retain their original shape even in
  the melted state. Because microwave ovens may differ in power levels,
  consul your "User's Guide" for specific directions for your
  particular model.

  From:  Crock Pot Recipe Booklet
  
  To cook on the stove:
  
  Mix the flour, salt and pepper together.  Coat meat with flour
  mixture. In a large fry pan, wok, or Dutch Oven, brown the meat in a
  little oil (cooking a little meat at a time until all is browned).
  Place meat in a large pot and add about 3 cups beef broth,
  Worcestershire, garlic, bay leaf, paprika, carrots, onions and
  celery. Stir to mix. Cook over medium heat until it comes to a slow
  boil, reduce to low and continue cooking (4 hours or so) until the
  liquid is reduced and meat is tender, stirring frequently.  Add
  potatoes and continue cooking about another 30 minutes or until
  potatoes are tender. Do not use Kitchen Bouquet. If necessary, add a
  little flour mixed with water to thicken.

      Title: Italian Meringue Shells
 Categories: Italian
      Yield: 8 meringues
 
      4 lg Egg whites, at room temp.
    1/8 ts Cream of tartar
        pn Salt
  1 1/2 c  Minus 2 tb granulated sugar
    1/2 c  Hot water
    1/4 ts Vanilla extract
 
  1. In the large bowl of an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until
  foamy. Add the cream of tartar and salt and continue beating until
  stiff peaks form.
  
  2. In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and water and stir
  well. Place mixture over medium-high heat and bring to a boil without
  stirring. Boil for 1-2 minutes or until bubbles thicken and a few
  drops dropped into ice water form a soft ball (238'F. on a candy
  thermometer).
  
  3. With the mixer on medium speed, add the vanilla to the whites and
  pour the hot syrup into the beaten egg whites in a slow, steady
  stream. Beat until the mixture is completely cool, smooth and shiny,
  anywhere from 6-8 minutes.
  
  4. Heat the oven to 200'F. and place the meringue mixture into a
  piping bag with a 1/2" star or plain tip.
  
  5. Place a piece of aluminum foil or wax paper on a baking sheet.
  Using a cup or small saucer, trace 8 (3") rounds on the paper with a
  toothpick or skewer. Spray lightly with baking spray.
  
  6. Beginning in the center of each round, pipe out the meringue in
  concentric circles. To form the sides, pipe 2 or 3 additional rings
  on top of the outside edge. The meringue also can be spooned on the
  3" circle outlines and smoothed into a small shape using a rubber
  spatula.
  
  7. Bake the meringue for 2 hours, or until dry and crisp but not
  brown. Cool on a baking sheet, then peel off the paper.

      Title: Mango Chicken Salad
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  Cooked chicken (see note)
      1    Mango
      1 cn Plain yogurt or sour cream
           -(8 oz)
      1 tb Minced fresh ginger
      1    Garlic clove, peeled and
           -minced (opt)
      1    Red bell pepper, cored and
           -minced
           Salt to taste
           Pepper to taste
           Paprika to taste
 
  Cook the chicken as desired. (Leftover chicken from the grill is the
  most delicious in this salad, but you can also cook the chicken in
  water or in the microwave.) Set aside to cool. When chicken is cool
  enough to handle, skin and cut into 1/2" chunks. Put in a bowl.
  
  Peel the mango, cut it into small pieces, about a 1/2", and add it to
  the bowl along with remaining ingredients. Stir gently until well
  combined.
  
  Serve on top of lettuce.
  
  Curried mango chicken salad variation: Season the mixture with 1
  teaspoon curry powder and a little ground hot pepper, if desired.
  
  NOTE: To cook chicken in a microwave, place breast halves (or
  equivalent weight) on a plate and cover with waxed paper. Microwave
  on high power for 8-9 minutes, rearranging twice during cooking.
  
  If you don't own a microwave, heat 1/2" of water in the bottom of a
  12" skillet. Place chicken pieces in water and return to the boil.
  Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer the meat 10 minutes (longer for
  dark meat) or until only the faintest hint of pink ramains in the
  meat. (Cut into it to see; you'll be cutting it into pieces later
  anyway.) Turn the meat over halfway through cooking. Cool and chop as
  required. Submitted By MICHAEL ORCHEKOWSKI   On   08-07-95

      8 oz Extra-thin rice vermicelli
           -(banh hoi)
      1 tb Roasted peanuts, ground
 
  Adapted from "The Foods of Vietnam," by Nicole Routhier (Stewart,
  Tabori & Chang, 1989): This dish is a classic Vietnamese specialty
  prepared for elegant occasions. The sugar cane used as skewers to
  grill the shrimp paste makes this dish unique, as the sweetness from
  the cane permeates the food. The dish may be prepared over two
  consecutive days. On day one, prepare the dipping sauce and
  condiments. The vegetable platter and shrimp paste can be assembled
  the following day. Traditionally, this dish is rolled together in a
  rice pancake with vegetables and noodles and dipped in peanut sauce.
  Fresh sugar cane, occasionally available at area markets, may be
  obtained at Caribbean markets; canned sugar cane is available at
  Asian grocery stores.
  
  Shell and devein the shrimp. sprinkle the salt over the shrimp and let
  stand for 20 minutes. Rinse the shrimp thoroughly with cold water.
  Drain and squeeze between your hands to remove excess water. Dry
  thoroughly with paper towels. Coarsely chop the shrimp; set aside.
  
  Boil the pork fat, if using, for 10 minutes. Drain and finely dice.
  
  In a food processor, combine the shrimp with the garlic, shallots and
  sugar. Process until the shrimp paste pulls away from the sides of the
  container, stopping as necessary to scrape down the sides. The paste
  should be very fine and sticky.
  
  Add the pork fat, fish sauce and black pepper to taste to the mixture
  in the processor. Pulse briefly, only enough to blend all of the
  ingredients. Cover and refrigerate.
  
  Meanwhile, prepare the Peanut Sauce and Vegetable Platter as directed
  in the following recipes.
  
  To assemble: Cover the rice papers with a damp towel and a sheet of
  plastic wrap; keep at room temperature until needed.
  
  Peel the fresh sugar cane; cut crosswise in 4" sections. Split each
  section lengthwise into quarters. (If using canned sugar cane, split
  each section lengthwise in half only, then thread 2 pieces lengthwise
  onto a skewer.)
  
  Pour about 1/4 cup of vegetable oil into a small bowl. Oil your
  fingers. Pick up about 2 tablespoons of the shrimp paste and mold it
  around, and halfway down, a piece of fresh sugar cane. Leave about 1
  1/2" of the sugar cane exposed, to serve as a handle. (If using
  canned sugar cane, there is no need to leave a handle - the skewers
  will serve as handles.) Press firmly so that the paste adheres to the
  cane. Proceed until you have used all the shrimp paste. Set aside on
  a platter until ready to grill.
  
  Prepare a charcoal grill.
  
  Meanwhile, steam the vermicelli noodles, then garnish with ground
  roasted peanuts. Keep warm. Pour the peanut sauce into individual
  bowls and place the Vegetable Platter and rice papers on the table.
  
  Grill the shrimp paste on the sugar cane over medium coals, turning
  frequently, for about 8 minutes. Transfer to a warm platter.
  
  To serve, each diner dips a rice paper round in a large shallow bowl
  of warm water for about 5 seconds to make the rice paper pliable,
  then places the paper on a dinner plate. Then each person adds
  different ingredients from the Vegetable Platter, some noodles and a
  piece of the shrimp paste, which has been removed from the sugar
  cane. The rice paper is then rolled up to form a neat package. The
  roll is dipped in the Peanut Sauce and eaten out of hand.
  
  The remaining sugar cane may be chewed.
  
  NOTE: If both types of sugar cane are unavailable, use skewers. Shape
  the shrimp paste into meatballs and thread 3 or 4 on each skewer.

 Categories: Tomatoes, Can/preserv
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      4 lb Ripe roma tomatoes
      1 tb Sea salt
      1 ts Fresh ground white pepper
     16 oz Extra-virgin olive oil
           -(enough to cover the
           -tomatoes)
    1/2 c  Fresh basil leaves
      4    Garlic cloves, whole
 
  Turn your oven to its lowest setting (somewhere in the 140'F. range).
  Line 2 baking sheets with aluminum foil and place a baking rack on
  top of the foil. Slice tomatoes lengthwise, cut off bottoms, and lay
  slices on rack, cut side up. Sprinkle with salt and white pepper and
  place them in the oven.
  
  The first time you make the tomatoes, check on them every two hours
  or so. (Oven temperatures vary; I usually let my tomatoes dry
  overnight.) They are done when most of the detectable moisture is
  gone, and the golden wrinkles form all over the tomato. (If they
  become brownish-red, they are burnt.)
  
  Remove them from the oven and place them in a jar with the garlic and
  fresh basil leaves. Fill the jar with olive oil.

      Title: Seven-Hour Leg of Lamb
 Categories: Main dish, Meats
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      6 md Onions, quartered
      6    Carrots, peeled & quartered
      1    Garlic head, separated into
           -cloves, each peeled and
           -halved
      6    Bay leaves
      1 bn Fresh thyme
           -OR
      4 ts Dried thyme
      1    Lamb leg, bone-in, 6-7 lbs.
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      2 cn Dry white wine, such as
           -Algote (750 ml each)
      5 lb Large boiling potatoes,
           -peeled and quartered
      5    Tomatoes, peeled, cored,
           -seeded and chopped
 
  Several people, including an important cookbook editor, complained
  that the seven-hour leg of lamb from Patricia Wells' "Bistro Cooking"
  (Workman Publishing) didn't work. "Cooking a leg of lamb at 425'F.
  for 7 hours is insane, not to mention it will blow up your oven,"
  griped one of the critics. We thought the method sounded rediculous
  too - it seemed that if you were going to cook a lamb for seven
  hours, at least you should do it at a lower temperature. We knew we
  had a sure-fire lower. We were wrong. The recipe turned out to be one
  of the best we've tasted so far this year.
  
  Layer onions, carrots, garlic, bay leaves and thyme on bottom of
  non-reactive roaster (with cover) large enough to hold lamb. Place
  lamb on top of onion and carrot mixture and roast, uncovered, at
  425'F. 30 minutes. Remove roaster from oven and generously season
  lamb with salt and pepper to taste. Return to oven and roast 30
  minutes more.
  
  Remove roaster from oven, leaving oven on. Place roaster on top of
  stove, slowly pour wine over lamb, cover, and bring liquid to boil.
  Return roaster, covered, to oven and roast 4-5 additional hours until
  lamb is fork tender, but not yet falling off the bone. (Timing will
  vary according to size and age of lamb and type of roasting pan
  used.) Check on lamb from time to time, reducing oven heat if lamb
  begins to burn or liquid begins to evaporate too much.
  
  When lamb is fork tender, bury potatoes and tomatoes in liquid. Cover
  and roast until potatoes are cooked through, about 1 hour more. Lamb
  should now be very tender, still juicy and falling off bone.

      Title: Honey-Fried Chicken with Thyme-Mint Cream Sauce
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Chicken (3-3.5 lb)
    1/2 c  Honey
      2 tb Raspberry or other fruit
           -vinegar
    1/2 c  Flour
      2 tb Whole-wheat flour
      2 ts Cayenne pepper
      2    Eggs
    1/4 c  Buttermilk
      1 c  Vegetable oil
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
           Thyme-Mint Cream Sauce
 
  In his book "The New Texas Cuisine" (Doubleday), Stephen Pyles writes
  that if he had to choose one last meal, it would be this fried
  chicken. Craig Claiborne liked it so much when he tasted it at Routh
  Street Cafe, the Dallas restaurant Pyles once owned, that he included
  the recipe in his book "Craig Claiborne's Southern Cooking" (without
  crediting Pyles).
  
  Cut chicken into six serving pieces and place in a mixing bowl,
  reserving backbone, neck and wings for stock. Stir honey and vinegar
  together and pour over chicken. Marinate at least 2 hours, mixing
  occasionally.
  
  In separate mixing bowl, combine flour, whle-wheat flour and cayenne.
  Set aside.
  
  In another mixing bowl, whisk together eggs and buttermilk.
  
  In large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat to exactly 300'F.
  (Be sure to use reliable cooking thermometer. Honey coating on
  chicken will burn if oil is too hot. Too cool, chicken will be
  greasy.)
  
  Remove chicken from marinade and drain on paper towels. Dip chicken
  pieces in egg wash, season with salt and pepper to taste and dredge in
  flour-cayenne mixture, coating thoroughly. When all chicken pieces are
  coated, strain marinade and reserve 1 tablespoon for sauce.
  
  Gently drop dark meat chicken pieces in hot oil and cook until
  browned on one side, 5-6 minutes. Turn pieces over. Add white meat
  pieces and continue cooking, adjusting heat so chicken browns evenly
  without burning. Turn pieces again. Remove pieces as they become
  browned on both sides and tender when pierced with fork. Dark meat
  should cook 15-18 minutes total, white meat 10-12 minutes. Transfer
  chicken to 200'F. oven and keep warm while making sauce. Serve with
  Thyme-Mint Cream Sauce.

 Categories: Bbq/grill, Fish/seafoo, Caribbean
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 tb Allspice berries
      2    Jalapeno or serrano
           -chiles, seeded and minced
           -(more or less to taste)
      3    Clove Garlic, minced or

      1 tb Orange zest, grated
      1 tb Vegetable oil
           Salt And Pepper
  1 1/2 lb Sea bass fillets, cut in
           -serving portions
      2    Navel oranges, cut in
           -1-inch slices
 
  Description:
  
  Based on the classic jerk seasoning, this marinade adds distinctive
  flavor from orange zest to balance with the zesty spice from fresh
  chile. Ground allspice can be used in place of the freshly ground
  whole berries, but the flavor will not be as pronounced.
  
  Along with the Island Black Bean and Rice Salad, sliced fresh mangoes
  with a squeeze of lime juice would be ideal with this zesty grilled
  fish.
  
  Instructions:
  
  Finely crush the allspice berries with a mortar and pestle, or grind
  them with a spice grinder.  In a small bowl, combine allspice with
  the jalapeno chili, garlic, onions, orange zest, oil, salt and
  pepper. Stir to mix well. Preheat the grill.
  
  Set the sea bas fillets in a shallow dish and lightly spoon the
  marinade mixture over.  Turn the fillets so they are evenly coated in
  the marinade and set aside 10 to 15 minutes (chill if the ambient
  temperature is quite warm).
  
  Put the fish fillets on the hot grill, with the oranges slices
  alongside. Cook until the fish is just opaque through. 3 to 4 minutes
  per side. Turn the orange slices occasionally, so they brown evenly.
  
  Serve the grilled sea bass with a grilled orange slice and the Island
  Black Bean and Rice Salad alongside.

           -bones removed
    3/4 lb Halibut fillet, skin and
           -bones removed
      8    To 10 Green onion, trimmed

           Teriyaki Sauce
    1/4 c  Mirin (sweet rice wine) or
           -dry sherry
    1/2 c  Soy sauce, preferably
           -reduced-sodium
    1/2 c  Chicken broth
      2 ts Cornstarch, stirred with 1
           -tbs water
 
  Description:
  
  Yakitori is the Japanese term for small skewers of meat-often
  chicken-brushed with with teriyaki sauce and grilled.  Yakitori stands
  abound in Japan, making it a favorite snack food or quick lunch on a
  busy day.  Some of the teriyaki sauce used for the fish can be used
  to season eggplant before grilling.  An unusual, and unusually
  delicious, accompaniment is grilled rice cake.
  
  For a traditional teriyaki finish, cornstarch is added to part of the
  sauce, making a shining glaze to brush on the fish before serving.
  ("Teriyaki" means "shining broil" in Japanese.)  You can omit this
  step if you like.
  
  Bamboo skewers 6 inches long are best for this recipe.  Soak them in
  cold water for at least 30 minutes before using.
  Instructions:
  
  Teriyaki Sauce:
  
  To make the sauce, combine the mirin, soy sauce, and chicken broth in
  a small sauce pan.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 1 minute.  For the
  teriyaki glaze, pour 1/3 of the teriyaki sauce into a small pan and
  heat gently.  Stir in the cornstarch mixture and cook until
  thickened, about 2 minutes.  Set aside the sauce and glaze.
  
  Salmon and Halibut Yakitori:
  
  Preheat the grill.
  
  Cut the salmon and halibut into 1 1/2 inch squares, about 3/4 inch
  thick. Cut the trimmed green onions into 1 1/2 inch lengths.
  
  Thread four pieces of fish, alternating salmon and halibut, on each
  skewer, with three pieces of green onion between the fish.  Brush the
  skewers with some teriyaki sauce and let sit until grill is ready.
  
  Grill the fish skewers over a medium-hot fire for 1 to 2 minutes.
  Brush the tops with teriyaki sauce, turn the skewers and brush the
  cooked side with teriyaki sauce.  Continue grilling just until the
  fish is nicely browned and opaque through, 1 to 2 minutes longer.
  Brush both sides of the skewers with the teriyaki glaze and serve
  immediately.

      Title: Grilled Rice Cakes
 Categories: Bbq/grill, Pasta/rice
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Water
           Salt
  1 1/2 c  Short-grain rice
      1 tb Seasoned rice vinegar or
           -sherry vinegar
 
  Description:
  
  The key here is using starchier short-grained rice to ensure that it
  holds together.  As an alternative, you can add chopped mushrooms
  (shitake or common) to the rice mixture before chilling to set.
  Extra teriyaki sauce from the yakitori can be drizzled over just
  before serving.
  
  Instructions:
  
  Brink the water and a generous pinch of salt to a boil in a medium
  saucepan.  Stir in the rice, lower the heat and cook, covered, over
  medium-low until the rice has absorbed all the liquid, about 18
  minutes. Stir the rice every 5 minutes or so, to help release the
  starch and promote stickiness.
  
  When cooked, take the rice from the heat and stir in the rice
  vinegar.  Let cool to tepid, stirring occasionally; taste for
  seasoning.  Spoon the rice mixture into a lightly oiled 9-inch square
  or round cake pan. With wet or lightly oil hands, press the rice down
  evenly into the pan. Chill until firm.
  
  Preheat the grill.
  
  Turn the set rice onto a cutting board and cut into 12 even shapes
  (squares, triangles, wedges).  Lightly brush the grill with oil and
  add rice cakes.  Grill until nicely colored, 1 to 2 minutes, then
  turn and grill 1 to 2 minutes more.  Serve immediately.

      Title: Grilled Whole Japanese Eggplant
 Categories: Bbq/grill, Japanese, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 serving
 
           Japanese eggplant
 
  Description:
  
  Small and slender, Japanese eggplants are perfect grilling material.
  
  Instructions:
  
  Leave the stem intact, simply cut the eggplants in half lengthwise
  (the stem will help hold the eggplant together as it cooks).  Brush
  the side of the eggplant with the teriyaki sauce left over from the
  yakitori recipe. Grill over a hot fire, cut side down, until nicely
  browned, Then turn the eggplant and cook fir 1 or 2 minutes on the
  skin side. Brush with a little more teriyaki sauce before serving.
  Source/Author: Simply Seafood / typo Bob Shiells
  
  Notes:
  
  If you cannot find the small Japanese eggplants, you can use the
  larger common eggplant.  Trim and cut into 1 1/2-inch slices before
  cooking. Submitted By BOB SHIELLS   On   08-08-95

 Categories: Desserts, Scot/irish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           CRANACHAN & SHORTBREAD
           ======================
           -
 
  Cranachan
  =========
  
  This is a variation of the traditional Scottish dessert, often served
  at Harvest festivals. The secret of the dish is not to sweeten the
  cream but to allow the toasted oatmeal to develop a nutty flavour,
  making a beautiful contrast with the jam.
  
  Serves 4
  
  INGREDIENTS:
  
  1/2 pint double cream
  8   oz   blackcurrant jam
  1/2 cup  medium oatmeal
      Dash Creme de Cassis (opt)
  
  Melt the jam mixed with creme de cassis over a medium heat, adding
  extra whole berries if you like. Toast the oatmeat under a slow grill
  making sure the oatmeal doesn't brown - just let the flavour mature.
  
  Add half the toasted oatmeal to the cream and whip to a full
  consistancy. Pour the jam into wine glasses and fill with the cream
  mixture. Sprinkle the rest of the oatmeal on top. The jam should
  still be warm when the dish is served, contrasting with the cream.
  
  Serve with shortbread then sit back and smile smugly at guests'
  compliments.
  
  Variations: Any harvest fruit instead of blackcurrant. To accent the
  nutty flavour of the toasted oatmeal, add crushed hazelnuts.
  
  "Traditional" Cranachan
  =======================
  
  Also known as Caledonian Ice, Iced Stapag and Cream Crowdie.
  
  Serves 4
  
  INGREDIENTS:
  
  1   pint        double cream
  2   tablespoons castor sugar
  1/2 cup         coarse oatmeal
      Dash        Drambuie or whisky Blackcurrants to taste (opt)
  
  Whip the cream, add sugar and whisky. Freeze until edges crystalise.
  Toast the oatmeal and mix it through the iced cream mixture, return
  to the freezer and freeze until solid. Remove iced cream half an hour
  before serving.
  
  If you're using blackcurrants or other berries, serve them fresh with
  the iced cream and shortbread.
  
  Shortbread
  ==========
  
  Shortbread is a commonplace cake in Scotland, often served with
  scones and other cakes for afternoon tea.
  
  The usual shape of shortbread is round flat 1/4" - 1/2" thick cakes
  with the edges pinched with the finger and thumb to form sunrays - a
  tradition which is thought to have arisen from pre-christian
  sunworship. It is also baked into 4" x 1/2" x 1/4" fingers.
  
  Shortbread is mandatory at Christmas and Hogmany (New Year's Eve),
  when it is served with whisky. However, it should be noted that the
  shortbread is not a pre-requisite for the whisky on these occasions...

      Title: Cranachan & Shortbread (Cont'd)
 Categories: Desserts, Scot/irish
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      8 oz Plain flour
      4 oz Corn flour
      8 oz Margarine
      4 oz Castor sugar
        dr Vanilla essence
 
  Let all the ingredients come to room temperature. Blend the margarine,
  vanilla essence and sugar in a large bowl. Combine the flours and
  sift them into the bowl, mixing until you have a dough like a
  shortcrust pastry texture. Don't knead or overwork the mixture or the
  shortbread will become heavy when baked. Form the mixture into rounds
  or fingers as described above and prick the surface with a fork.
  Specialist shortbread moulding blocks are available but it can be
  formed freehand or by using other cake moulds.
  
  Bake open in a pre-heated oven at 190c for 25 minutes. Allow the
  shortbread to turn a light brown without burning or scorching before
  turning out onto cooling racks.

  this way.
  
  Fill a very large pot with salted water & bring to a full rolling
  boil. Place gnocchi in the water, lower to a simmer & stir gently
  occasionally. The gnocchi will rise to the surface when it is done.

      Title: Spanish Pork Stew with Potatoes
 Categories: Crockpot, Main dish, Soup/stew, Potatoes
      Yield: 4 servings
 
MMMMM---------------------HOUSTON _CHRONICLE--------------------------
      4 md Potatoes
      1 lb Tomatoes
      1    Bell peppers
      2 tb Vinegar
      1 lb Pork shoulder butt
      3    Garlic cloves, crushed
      1 c  Stock
      1    Bay leaves
      1 md Onions, chopped
 
  Cut pork into large chunks.  Coarsely chop tomatoes.  Peel potatoes
  and cut into thick chunks.  Seed, core, and thinly slice bell pepper.
  
  Brown pork in 2 tb oil if desired.  Layer ingredients in crockpot in
  order; cook until meat is tender, about 10 hours.
  
  Stovetop preparation: Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat. Add
  pork and saute a few minutes, until lightly browned.  Add garlic and
  saute well. Add onion and saute until tender.  Add tomatoes and cook
  5 minutes. Att water, vinegar, and bay leaf. Salt and pepper to
  taste. Bring to boil. Cover and simmer until pork is almost tender,
  about 40 minutes. Stir in green pepper. Add potatoes around sides and
  simmer, covered, until tender, about 15 minutes.  Avoid stirring or
  overcooking potatoes.
  
  Sylvia's comments: this was easy to fix, and the only problem was
  that it was just a hair bland.  I added some Worcestershire to my
  bowl, and it was fine.  I used balsamic vinegar and sliced the onion
  instead of chopping it so it was easier to pick out.  I also used
  canned tomatoes. With the added stock, it was more soup than stew.

      Title: Dr. Pepper Ham
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 1 servings
 
 
  The ingredients are very simple...
  
  1 ham, any size (preferably natural ham on the bone, but processed
  works
                   well, too.) 1 Dr. Pepper (3 ltr. size)
  
  Line a deep, round roasting pan with aluminum foil.  Score the ham on
  all sides approximately 1/2 to 1" deep, depending on the size of the
  ham. Then, place the ham in the roasting pan.  Pour Dr. Pepper over
  the ham liberally, allowing it to soak into the scores.  Then cover
  the ham with aluminum foil and place in a 350 degree oven.  Every
  half hour, remove the pot from the oven, turn the ham over, and
  resoak with Dr. Pepper. Let the ham cook a minimum of 3 1/2
  hours...more for a larger ham. Remove from the pot and serve.
  
  The carbonation cooks away.  The secret is that the main ingredient
  in Dr. Pepper is prune juice and other fruit juices which cook down
  into the meat. It doesn't taste fruity, though.  It just makes the
  sweetest, juiciest ham you have ever tasted.

  brown on the other side. Transfer to paper towels to drain, sprinkle
  with salt, and serve promptly while still hot.

      2    Swordfish steaks, 1/2-3/4"

           Green Grape and Parsley
           -Relish (recipe follows)
 
  From "Big Flavors of the Hot Sun" (William Morrow, $27.50) by Chris
  Schlesinger and John Willoughby. Swordfish is an outstanding fish for
  grilling, right up there with tuna. The meat is firm and steak-like,
  its relatively high oil content keeps it moist and its flavor is mild
  but distinctive.
  
  Rub the swordfish lightly with vegetable oil, sprinkle liberally with
  salt and pepper and grill over a medium fire for 4-5 minutes per
  side, turning once, until almost completely opaque. Remove from the
  grill and serve, accompanied by the relish (recipe follows).

  This relish is one of those funny things that happen every once in a
  while: You come up with an idea that looks and sounds really strange,
  then when you make it, the flavor turns out to be not only unique but
  truly tasty. The mixture is very strong with vinegar and garlic, but
  when you bite into the grapes, the resulting bursts of sweetness
  balance the flavor.
  
  Mix 'em all together. That's it. This relish will keep, covered and
  refrigerated, for 3 or 4 days.

 Categories: Fish/seafoo, Hot/spicy
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/2 ts Unsalted butter
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
      6    Red snapper fillets (6 oz)
    3/4 c  Charred Jalapeno-Basil
           -Vinaigrette (recipe
           -follows)
 
  From "Bobby Flay's Bold American Food" (warner Books, $34.95):
  American red snapper is sometimes hard to find, but it is the best,
  so ask for it at your fish market. Some of the imported snapper is
  hardly worth bothering about, and you may want to substitute halibut
  or sea bass if only the imports are available. Cook the fish
  naturally - never dredge it in flour before frying.
  
  In a medium skillet over medium heat, heat the oil until it begins to
  smoke and then add the butter. Season the fillets on both sides with
  salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, starting
  with the skin-side down. (If you have an electric range, brown the
  fillets on one side, turn them, and finish cooking in a preheated
  350'F. oven for 3 minutes.) Remove the cooked fillets to a warm plate
  and serve immediately with the vinaigrette (recipe follows).

      2 tb Basil chiffonade *
      1 tb Ancho chili powder
           Salt
           Fresh black pepper
 
  As soon as the snapper comes off the pan, hit it with the vinaigrette
  (which has to be at room temperature).
  
  In a small saute pan over high heat, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil
  and cook jalapeno on all sides until skin is charred. Let pepper cool
  and then slice it thinly, including seeds and stem.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, combine remaining ingredients, including salt
  and pepper to taste, with jalapeno, and whisk until blended. (May be
  prepared 6 hours ahead, covered and refrigerated. Bring to room
  temperature before serving.)
  
  Spoon charred jalapeno-basil vinaigrette to taste over fish as soon
  as you take it from pan and serve it immediately.
  
  * Chiffonade, literally translated from French, means "made of rags."
  In the kitchen, it refers to thin shreds or strips cut from such
  vegetables as lettuce, spinach, sorrel or other greens.

      Yield: 12 servings
 
      1    Turkey
      4 oz Butter
      2 oz Olive oil
      1 c  Sage, fresh; chopped
      2 tb Garlic cloves, crushed
           Salt
           Pepper
      2 lb Garlic cloves; peeled
      2 c  Wine, white
      2 c  Stock, chicken
    1/2 c  Flour
 
  Turkey stock may be substituted for chicken stock, if available.
  
  Clean and wash the turkey and pat dry with a paper towel. Loosen the
  skin of the breast and rub the turkey under the skin with the sage
  and chopped garlic. Season the turkey inside and out with salt and
  pepper and remaining sage. Place turkey in a large roasting pan,
  preferably on a rack. Roast the turkey at 350 degrees, basting every
  twenty minutes with the melted butter and olive oil combined.
  
  An hour and half before the turkey will be finished, add the 400
  garlic cloves to the bottom of the roasting pan. Continue to baste
  the turkey and at the same time stir the cloves at the bottom of the
  pan. Then the turkey is done, remove it from the pan. Drain the
  drippings into a small sauce pan, reserving the garlic in the
  roasting pan. Place the roasting pan on a burner over medium-high
  heat. Add white wine and stock. Bring to a boil, stirring with a wisk
  to mash the roasted garlic cloves.
  
  Place the saucepan with the drippings over medium heat and with a
  whip add the flour to form a roux. Add the roux to the garlic gravy a
  little at a time until it reaches the desired thickness. Carve the
  turkey and serve with the 400-clove garlic gravy, accompnied by
  garlic mashed potatoes.
  
  This popular North Beach restaurant claims that it "seasons its
  garlic with food."  You'll see what they mean when you look at the
  list of ingredients.

      Title: Carrots with Olives & Twenty Cloves of Garlic
 Categories: Vegetables, Side dish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 tb Olive oil or canola oil
      1 lg Onion
           - peeled & coarsely chopped
     20 sm Garlic cloves; peeled, whole
      1 c  Vegetable stock
      1 lb Carrots; cut into 1" chunks
    1/2 ts Dried rosemary leaves
    1/4 c  Coarsely chopped olive meat
           -(preferably oil-cured)
    1/4 ts Sea salt; or to taste
 
  PRESSURE COOKER:
  
  1.  Heat the oil in in the cooker and saute the onions and garlic
  until the onions are soft, about 2 minutes.
  
  2.  Add the stock (watch for sputtering oil!) and bring to the boil.
  Add the carrots, rosemary, olives and salt.
  
  3.  Lock the lid in place and over high heat bring to high pressure.
  Lower the pressure with a quick-release method.  Remove the lid,
  tilting it away from you to allow any excess steam to escape.  If the
  carrots are not quite done, set the lid back into place and let them
  cook in the residual steam for another minute or two.
  
  4.  Serve the mixture in small bowls or lift out the solid
  ingredients with a slotted spoon and serve them on a plate, reserving
  any leftover liquid for cooking grains or adding to the soup pot.
  
  STANDARD STOVETOP: In a heavy 3-quart saucepan, follow steps 1 and 2.
  Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until
  the carrots are tender, about 8 to 12 minutes.  Follow step 4.
  
  VARIATION: Potatoes with Twenty Cloves of Garlic:  Replace the
  carrots with small new potatoes about 1 ounce each, or larger
  thin-skinned potatoes cut into chunks.  Cook them for 5 minutes under
  high-pressure, or 12 to 15 minutes standard stovetop method.

  *Note: Colombo said that to make the vegetable stock, she cooked a
  carrot, onion, potato, rib of celery and a few sprigs of parsley in 1
  1/4 quarts water.  When the vegetables were tender, she pureed them
  in the blender and added all to the beans.  "The soup was delicious,"
  she said.
  
  Place beans and water in a large kettle.  Cook 1 hour.  While beans
  are cooking, prepare vegetables.
  
  In a large skillet, heat olive oil.  Add onion, garlic, celery,
  carrot, mushrooms and potato.  Saute lightly.  Add to the beans along
  with herbs, salt and peppers.  Go light on the herbs at first - you
  can always add more.  Add vegetable stock.
  
  Bring soup to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 1 to 1 1/2 hours or
  until beans are tender.  Add the squash in the last 20 minutes of
  cooking. Adjust seasonings and serve.
  
  Yield: Approximately 2 to 2 1/2 quarts.

  Yield: 10 to 12 servings.
  
  About the bases:  Chicken or beef broth can be substituted for the
  bases. If using broth, eliminate water and add 3 to 4 cups each of
  chicken and beef broth.  Soup bases come in a variety of flavors.
  They are available in 1-pint containers from Liquor Outlet on
  Hurstbourne Parkway, Lotsa Pasta on Shelbyville Road and Burger's
  Super Market on Ray Avenue.
  
  About chipotle peppers: These are smoked jalapenos that have been
  either dried or canned in adobo sauce, a Mexican barbecue sauce.
  Burger's Super Market and Lotsa Pasta carry them.
  
  To flame wine: Place wine in a shallow pan or skillet.  Heat until
  warm but well below the boiling point.  Ignite by touching the edge
  of the pan with the flame of a match or candle, taking care not to
  ignite your clothing. [Cathy's editorial comment -- Duh!!!]

  After hunting with a lantern in your hand all night, take the possum
  you have bagged and break his neck by putting your foot on the
  possum's head and pulling up on his tail.  Use boiling water to scald
  Brother Possum. In a large pan, dress the animal by pulling out those
  hairs on him. When all is well done, cut Brother Possum into four
  parts. Add salt and boil the meat until tender.  Make your dumplings
  and add them slowly to the boiling meat.  After the possum has boiled
  about an hour, put the parts into a baking dish. Peel sweet potatoes
  and slice them thick. Place the slices in the pan around the pieces
  of possum. Add onions if desired. Bake for 1 hour.  This is a Sunday
  dinner for 12 people with the dumplings. Submitted By JENNY EUWINE

  wax paper, shape and roll mixture into 2 logs, 6 inches long and 2
  inches in diameter.  Wrap in plastic wrap or foil and refrigerate
  overnight.
  
  To serve, slice the rolls into rounds about 1/2 inch thick and fry in
  a heavy skillet over medium-low heat for 3 to 4 minutes on each side
  or until done.  Drain on paper towels and serve immediately.
  
  An alternate way to prepare sausage is to shape mixture into large
  marble-size balls.  Freeze if desired.  To serve, bake frozen on a
  rack, starting in a cold oven, for 20 min. at 325 F.

 Categories: Sausage, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 sm Onion, minced
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      6 c  Finely shredded red cabbage
           -(about 1 head)
      4 ea Bay leaves
  1 1/2 c  Dry red wine
      2 c  Tawny Port
      1 ea Whole skinless boneless
           -chicken breast (about 1/2
           -pound)
      3 lg Egg whites
      3 c  Heavy cream
      4 qt Chicken broth for poaching
           -the sausages
           Olive oil for sauteing the
           -sausages if desired
 
  In a kettle cook the onion in the oil over moderate heat, stirring,
  until it is golden, stir in the cabbage, and cook the mixture,
  stirring occasionally, until the cabbage is softened.  Add the bay
  leaves, the red wine, Port, and salt and pepper to taste and boil the
  mixture, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until the liquid
  is evaporated. Discard the bay leaves and let the mixture cool. In a
  meat grinder fitted with the fine blade grind the chicken (or,
  alternatively, chop it fine) and transfer it to a food processor.
  With the motor running add the egg whites, 1 at a time, puree the
  mixture, and add the cream in a slow stream. Season the chicken
  mixture with salt and pepper. In a large bowl set in a larger bowl of
  ice and cold water stir together the chicken mixture and the cabbage
  mixture.  Arrange 2 heaping Tsp. of the mixture lengthwise down the
  middle of an 8 inch length of Saran Wrap, roll it into a 4 inch long
  sausage shape, using the Saran Wrap as a guide, and roll up the Saran
  Wrap tightly. Tie the ends of the sausage with kitchen string or with
  twist-ties and make more sausages with the remaining mixture in the
  same manner, transferring them as they are made to a baking sheet. In
  a large kettle bring the broth to a simmer, in it poach the sausages
  in batches, turning them once carefully, for 20 to 25 minutes, or
  until they become firm and opaque, transferring them as they are
  cooked to a large bowl of ice and cold water to stop the cooking, and
  let them cool. Discard the kitchen string and the saran Wrap.  In a
  skillet saute the sausages in the oil over moderately high heat for 2
  minutes on each side, or until they are browned well, or ,
  alternatively, on a baking sheet heat the sausages in a preheated 325
  oven for 8 minutes, or until they are hot. Makes about 30 sausages.

  Description:
  
  Ideal for a summer buffet, the flavors of this salad marry nicely,
  especially when made in advance.  For a shortcut, look for marinated
  mussels in your seafood market case.  Some stores offer this as a
  delicious shortcut for their customers.  You can make this salad up
  to a day ahead, but if doing so reserve the spinach and add it just
  before serving. If you refrigerate the salad, bring it to room
  temperate about 20 minutes before serving; this will enhance the
  flavors.
  
  Instructions:
  
  Pull the feathery fronds from the fennel stalks, coarsely chop and set
  aside.  Cut the tough stalks from the bulb and discard.  Cut the
  fennel bulb vertically into quarters, cut out and discard the core.
  Thinly slice the fennel on the diagonal, starting where the stalks
  were reomved. Slice the pepper cross-wise into match-stick size
  pieces.  In a large bowl, combine the fennel bulb and fronds, yellow
  pepper, beans and spinach.
  
  In a 10-inch pot, combine the water, shallots and garlic.  Place a
  steamer rack in the pot, cover and bring to a boil.  Add the mussels,
  and steam until the mussels are open, 3 to 5 minutes.  Discard any
  unopened mussels. Transfer the mussels to a bowl and set aside.
  
  Remove the steamer rack and scoop out the shallots and garlic with a
  slotted spoon.  Boil the cooking liquid uncovered until reduced to
  1/4 cup. Finely chop the shallots and garlic and put them in a medium
  bowl. Add the reduced mussel liquid along with the vinegar, mustard,
  salt, pepper and cayenne, if using.  Whisk in th olive oil.
  
  Reserve 8 mussels in their shells to decorate the salad and remove
  the rest from their shells.  Add the mussel meats to the fennel
  mixture. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss.  Taste and adjust
  seasonings. To the salad with the remaining mussels and serve.

  Notes:
  
   Dead or Alive
  
  Shellfish, such as mussels, need to be alive before cooking. They may
  open their shells to breathe, so press any opened shells together; if
  they close the mussel is alive.  Discard those that do not close or
  any crashed shells.  Just before using, scrub mussels to remove
  dirts. Pull out the tough hair-loke stands, called beard, along one
  side. Simply hold the mussel in one hand with the threads facing the
  second hand. Gently slide the beard up and down, pulling it until ti
  pops out. Cook mussels immediately, since removing the beard may kill
  them.
  
   Mussel Salad Dressing
  
  When substituting fish for mussels, it's easy to replace the liquid
  obtained from steaming the mussels to make the salad dressing.  In a
  medium pot, bring 1 10z can clam juice (1 1/4 cup), 4 shallots and 8
  cloves garlic to a boil; boil, uncovered until vegetables are soft
  and the liquid is reduced to 1/4 cup, about 10 minutes.  Finish the
  dressing as in the recipe, by adding the vinegar, mustard and other
  ingredients. Seafood Alternatives: grilled bluefish, catfish, trout,
  swordfish, shrimp, salmon

  thoroughly, letting it simmer 5-10 minutes. Then put it in a cotton
  bag large enough to cover the lungs, and apply to the chest as hot as
  the patient can bear. When this gets cool, apply another and thus
  continue by reheating the poultices, and in a few hours the patient
  will be out of danger. this simple remedy has never failed in this
  too often fatal malady. Usually four applications will do, but
  continue always until perspiration starts freely from the chest.

  Every joy which comes to you is a jewel which should be carefully
  placed in the jewel casket of the mind. But the thefts, the
  disappointments, the mistakes should be left with their own hour and
  day. Yesterday belongs distinctly to the past. The failures which
  belong to it are perished. It is wicked, inhuman to dig up the
  remnants of each and rehash it today. Half the failures made by both
  men and women are brought about by their dwelling on other past
  failures. Half the misires of both heart and mind are repeated
  because they are not left to the past. No man or woman could possibly
  live properly today if they spend time in living over the yesterday.
  Every well-balanced man and woman does each day that which he
  believes to be right. When tomorrow comes let today enjoy the peace
  of the past.

  potatoes until they are cooked through, but do not overcook them.
  Remove from heat, drain & plunge into cold water to stop them
  cooking. Chil lightly in the refrigerator.
  
  When ready to serve, slice the potatoes fairly thickly.  Sprinkle
  with salt & pepper & generously spray with the juice of 1/2 a lime,
  use a whole lime if they are small.  Sprinkle with serrano chile
  powder (this is available from Mexican or Spanish style supermarkets
  & imparts a more smoky flavour than ground red chiles) & garnish with
  jalapenoes. Serve as part of a salad buffet.
  
  This is an excellent dish to take on a picnic.  Prepare it at the

 Categories: Soup/stew, Pasta/rice, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      5 c  Cauliflower florets (1 head)
      3 c  Vegetable stock
      1 tb Brown rice miso
      1 tb Low fat cream cheese
      1 tb Spice seasoning
    1/4 c  Scraped and finely cubed
           -carrot
    1/4 c  Scraped and finely cubed
           -celery
    1/4 c  Chopped scallion, white part
           -only (2-3 scallions)
      1 ts Louisiana style hot sauce
    1/4 ts Ground white pepper
    1/2 c  Fresh peas, or frozen peas,
           -thawed
 
  This deceptively mild soup is actually brimming with flavorful
  seasonings. The vitamin and protein rich brown rice miso, a soybean
  paste, is stocked in the ecthnic section of larger markets and by
  Asian groceries. Spike seasoning is an herb mix that can be found on
  your supermarket's spice rack.  You can creat a variety of robust,
  healthy vegetable purees using this recipe.  Try substituting an
  equal amount of trimmed and chopped asparagus, carrot, or spinach for
  the cauliflower. Combine the cauliflower and vegetable stock in a
  stockpot. Cook over medium heat for about 20 minutes, until the
  cauliflower is fork tender. Transfer the contents of the pot to a
  blender, add the miso and cream cheese, and puree until smooth.
  Return the puree to that stockpot.  Add all remaining ingredients
  except the peas and cook over low heat for about 5 minutes, until the
  vegetables are tender.  Stir in the peas.

      4 c  Whole milk
      1 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Onion, chopped fine
      2    Inches gingerroot, chopped
      1    Garlic clove, chopped
  1 1/2 tb Curry powder
      1 c  Poultry stock
      1 tb Flour
      1 tb Cornstarch
      3 c  Cooked and diced chicken,
           -shrimp, veal, fish,
           -sweetbreads and mushrooms
      2 c  Boiled rice
           Onion rings
           Hard cooked eggs, sieved
           Peanuts, grated
           Coconut, grated
           Relish
           Chutney

           Kumquats
           Bananas, halved and fried
           Mixed pickles
           Preserved ginger
 
  Heat the milk but do not scald.  Add the coconut and let stand 2 to 3
  hours in a cool place.
  
  Saute the chopped onion in the butter until light brown.
  Add the chopped gingerroot, chopped garlic, and curry powder.
  
  Strain the coconut from the milk and add the coconut to the curry
  mixture. Mix well.
  
  Add the poultry stock to the cooled, strained milk.  Mix 3
  tablespoons of this mixture with the flour and cornstarch.  Heat the
  remaining liquid and stir the starch paste into it.  Cook the sauce,
  stirring steadily, until it is hot and thickened.  Season to taste.
  
  Place half the sauce in a double boiler.  Add the coconut-curry
  mixture and stir.  Add the cooked diced chicken, shrimp, fish, veal,
  sweetbreads and mushrooms and heat over -NOT IN- boiling water.
  
  Heat the remaining sauce in the top of another double boiler over -NOT
  IN- boiling water.
  
  In preparing the boiled rice, it should be cooked until it is rather
  dry and flaky.
  
  Place the rice in a serving bowl.
  
  Remove the sauce and the coconut curry mixture from the heat and place
  each in a separate bowl.  Place each of the remaining ingredients in
  its own bowl.
  
  Start by passing the rice.  Spread a generous portion on each plate.
  This is the base or "Table".  Pass the sauce containing the combined
  poultry, seafood, mushrooms and veal next.  Spread a generous portion
  over the rice.
  
  Follow with the other dishes in this sequence:
  
    Onion rings, sieved hard cooked eggs, grated peanuts, grated
  coconut, relish, chutney, raisins, preserved ginger, kumquats, halved
  fried bananas and mixed pickles.
  
  Spread the desired amount of each on the plate over the preceding
  layer. Pass the extra heated sauce last.  Pour sauce over the entire
  dish. Enjoy!
  
  NOTE:  You may add as many additional items to this dish as you wish
  so long as they work well with the coconut-curry sauce.  Lamb,
  vegetables, most chicken dishes and the like do very well as part of
  a Rijsttafel.

  Carefully put lids and rings in place, then screw tops on tightly
  shut. Place jars on a wire rack; they will seal as they cool.
  
  Once jars are cool, decorate with round pieces of cloth and then glue
  on flowers, ribbons, etc. on lid, ring and side of jar.  Unscrew the
  ring (the lid should be sealed by now) and place a few cotton balls
  on top of the lid (makes it poofy on top), then a piece of cloth

  mouth canning jars with lids in hot soapy water and let drain, dry,
  and cool to room temperature.  Generously prepare jars with cooking
  spray and flour. Drain pineapple for 10 minutes, reserving juice.
  Puree drained pineapple in a blender.  Measure out 1 1/2 cups puree,
  adding a little juice if necessary to make 1 1/2 cups.  Set puree
  aside. Discard remaining juice. In a mixing bowl, combine applesauce,
  half brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg whites and
  pineapple puree.  Set aside.  In another mixing bowl, combine flour,
  baking powder, and baking soda.  Gradually, add to pineapple mixture
  in thirds, beating well with each addition.  Stir in coconut.  Spoon
  1 level cupful of batter into each jar.  Carefully wipe rims clean,
  then place jars on baking sheet (or they'll tip over) in the center
  of oven.  Bake 40 minutes.  Keep lids in hot water until they're
  used.  When cakes are done, remove jars which are HOT from oven one
  at a time.  If rims need cleaning, use moistened paper towel.
  Carefully put lids and rings in place, then screw tops on tightly
  shut.  Place jars on a wire rack; they will seal as they cool.
  
  Once jars are cool, decorate with round pieces of cloth and then glue
  on flowers, ribbons, etc. on lid, ring and side of jar.  Unscrew the
  ring (the lid should be sealed by now) and place a few cotton balls
  on top of the lid (makes it poofy on top), then a piece of cloth
  (about 3" larger than the lid) on top and screw the ring back on.
  Decorate as desired (example pinking shears).

      Yield: 8 servings
 
MMMMM-----------------CHOCO/PEANUT BUTTER SWIRL----------------------
      1 c  Semi sweet chocolate chips
           Melted
    1/4 c  Peanut butter

MMMMM--------------------------CRUMBS---------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Unbleached flour
      1 c  Brown sugar -- packed
      1    Stick margarine -- softened
    1/2 c  Peanut butter

MMMMM---------------------------CAKE----------------------------------
      2    Egg whites -- whipped
    1/2 c  Skim milk -- at room
           Temperature
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
 
  Preheat oven to 350.  Prepare a 8" square baking pan with cooking
  spray and flour.  To prepare chocolate peanut butter swirl, melt the
  chocolate chips and peanut butter in a small saucepan over low heat,
  stirring often until smooth.  Remove from the heat; let cool while
  preparing the crumbs and batter.  To prepare crumbs, combine the
  flour, brown sugar, margarine, and peanut butter in a mixing bowl
  until the mixture forms crumbs.  Remove 3/4 cup (tightly packed) of
  the mixture and set aside.  To prepare cake, add egg whites, milk,
  vanilla, baking powder, and baking soda to the remaining crumbs in
  the mixing bowl until thoroughly moistened.  Spread half of the
  batter in the prepared pan; gently streak half of the chocolate
  peanut butter mixture over the top.  Repeat with the remaining batter
  and chocolate peanut butter mixture.  Scatter the reserved crumbs
  over the top, pressing them in gently so they adhere to the batter.
  Bake for about 50 minutes or until crumbs and top of the cake are
  firm.  Cover the pan loosely with aluminum foil, if the cake is
  getting too dark during baking, loosely cover it with a piece of
  aluminum foil.  Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 15
  minutes.  Loosen around the sides of the pan, then carefully invert
  onto the rack and turn right-side-up.  Cool completely before serving.

MMMMM----------------EDIBLE DECORATOR PAINT--------------------------
      1    Egg yolk
    1/2 ts Water
           Assorted colors of paste
           Food coloring
        sm -- soft paintbrush
           Powdered sugar icing
 
  Preheat oven at 350.  In a mixing bowl, combine margarine and sugar.
  Add 1 tablespoon water and almond extract; mix well.  Stir in flour
  until well combined.  Cover and chill for 2 to 3 hours.  On a floured
  surface, roll dough to a 1/4" thickness.  Using envelope as a
  pattern, cut shapes in dough with a sharp knife.  Reroll dough
  scraps.  Cut out 1" squares of dough to resemble stamps.  Transfer
  letters and stamps to unprepared baking sheet with a spatula.  Using
  a paintbrush, paint, addresses, postmarks, and stamps with Edible
  Decorator Paint.  Allow each color of paint to dry thoroughly before
  painting with additional colors.  Bake cookies for 25 to 30 minutes,
  removing stamps if they start to brown. Cool slightly and remove from
  baking sheet.  Cook completely.  Prepare powdered sugar icing and
  attach stamps to letters.  To make Edible Decorator Paint, mix egg
  yolk with 1/2 teaspoon water.  Divide mixture into several small
  cups. Add paste food coloring as desired.  If needed, add additional
  water, 1 drop at a time, to make paint the consistency of ink. Use
  thin coats of the paint. Allow each color to dry before proceeding
  with next color. In recipes using opaque or pastel paint, add white,
  paste or liquid, food coloring. This improves opaqueness and removes
  much of the yellow color of the egg yolk. Food painted with paint
  should be returned to the oven for a few minutes to set the paint and
  cook the egg yolk.

  mixture the consistency of coarse cornmeal.  Sprinkle on the water, 1
  tablespoon at a time, and continue mixing until you can gather the
  dough into a ball. Roll the dough into a 11" circle onto a floured
  surface.  Patch any cracks that may form, but otherwise try not to
  handle the dough more than necessary. Transfer the dough to prepared
  pie pan.  Trim the dough, leaving a 1" overhang. Crimp the
  overhanging dough into a decorative edge. Chill the crust 20 minutes.
  To prepare filling, in a mixing bowl, combine cream cheese, 1/2 cup
  sugar, lemon peel, and juice until creamy. Spread mixture into pie
  shell and top with fresh strawberries.  In a saucepan, cook frozen
  strawberries, remaining sugar, and cornstarch until bubbly then cook
  two minutes more. Cool completely; pour over strawberries in pie

  Recipe by: Better Homes And Gardens Family Favorites Made Lighter
  Preparation Time: 0:15
  
  Preheat oven at 450.  Prepare a baking sheet lined with foil with
  cooking spray.  Rinse fillets; pat dry with paper towels.  In a small
  covered saucepan cook the carrots in a small amount of boiling water
  about 4 minutes or until nearly tender. Drain well.  To assemble each
  package, fold each piece of waxed paper in half crosswise.  From
  each, cut out a half heart shape 6" longer and 2" wider than fillets.
  (The fold will be the center of the heart.)  Open each heart shape
  piece of paper.  Place a fillet on the right half  of each heart,
  tucking under any thin edges of the fillet. (If fillet is less than
  1/2" thick, stack fillets to about 1/2" thickness.).  In a small
  mixing bowl stir together mustard, honey, and lemon pepper seasoning.
  Spread mustard mixture over fish portions. Top with the carrots and
  onions.  Fold left of each heart over the fillet, matching edges.
  Starting at the top of each heart, seal the packages by folding the
  edges together in a double fold.  Fold only a small section at a time
  to ensure a tight seal.  Then twist the tip of each heart to seal the
  packages.  (The secret to a beautifully puffed papillote is a tight
  seal.) Place the packages on a baking sheet.  Bake for 12 to 15
  minutes or just until fillet begins to flake easily and the paper
  puffs up (carefully open paper to check doneness.)  To serve, cut a
  large X on the top of each package, then pull back the paper.
  Transfer packages to dinner plates.

      Title: Apple Butter
 Categories: Can/preserv, Condiments, Fruit, Tasteofhome
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 lb Of apples (I've used golden
           -delicious, granny smith,
           -pippin, arkansa black,
           -jonathan and macintosh,
           -they all work well)
      1 qt Apple cider (Try to use the
           -real stuff that hasn't been
           -clarified)
      1 c  Brown sugar
      1 c  White sugar
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Allspice
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
           A good book to read...
 
  This takes about 3-5 HOURS to do.  Have a day set aside.
  
  1) Peel, core and chop the apples and dump into a fairly huge pot.
  Pour in the cider and cook at medium heat about 45 minutes or until
  the apples get fall-apart tender.  Go at them with a potato masher
  until you have a pretty uniform texture.
  
  2) Add the sugars and the spices and stir in.  Bring to a simmer and
  cook for several hours, stirring every now and again to keep the
  stuff on the bottom from burning. You want to cook until it is really
  thick. You'll find that as it cooks, the liquid rises to the surface
  and it LOOKS runny. Don't be fooled, stir the liquid back in before
  you judge it ready for canning.
  
  3) Can in your sterilized jars.  Depending on how juicy the apples
  were and how long you cooked the mash, you'll have anywhere from a
  quart to a quart and a half of apple butter.  If you feel disquieted
  about not processing this mess, go right ahead.  Apple butter, unlike
  jams, doesn't lose as much flavor in processing.  It should keep for
  about a year.
  
  4) Get the kids and dole out the gooey, rubbery gunk that has stuck
  to the sides of the pan during cooking.  It tastes great and they'll
  love it.
  
  5) Once cool, label (with the date).

  Apple Butter 11 to 13 hours
  
  The big advantage in making preserve butters in a slow cooker is that
  you don't have to stir or stand over the pot waiting to stir. Adapt
  your favorite fruit butter recipes to fit the instructions and
  cooking time.
  
  To Cook: Place the cider and the apples in the slow cooker. Cover and
  cook on Low for 10 to 12 hours; do not stir. Rub the apples through a
  sieve; measure the apples and add as much sugar as there is apple.
  Add the spices and salt and return to the cooker. Cover, and cook on
  Low for another hour. Pour into clean, dry, 1/2-pint canning jars.
  Seal and process in a boiling-water bath or store in refrigerator.
  Makes 4 to 6 pints.

  stirring every now and then, for about 1 hour, or until yuca is
  tender. Remove from heat and stir in lime juice. Serve with Cuban or
  French bread that has been sliced and broiled until golden.
  
  As an alternative frozen corn on the cob will work, as well as fresh
  frozen kernels.  The fresh corn cob seems to impart a nice flavor to
  this dish.
  
  If you're wondering what to do with the wheels of corn, just pick 'em
  up with your fingers and nibble 'round the rims.
  
  This dish recieved rave reviews at the 1991 Blind Pass Marina Xmas
  Party.

           THE CREOLE AND CAJUN
           -COOKING OF LOUISIANA
           ============================
           -=============
           [by Malcolm Hebert]
 
  NOTE: Here's a little article about the joys of our local Louisiana
  cuisine, written by Malcolm Hebert, a cookbook author, the former
  food and wine editor of the San Jose Mercury News, and the son of
  Louisianians. (By the way, it's a venerable Louisiana name that's
  pronounced <A-bear>, not <HEE-bert> ...) - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  The best way to know the cooking of New Orleans is to be raised
  there. My mother and father, who were born nearby, were proud of
  their heritage. Every year my parents drove "south" to visit my
  relatives, to feast on crabs, crawfish, gumbos, bisques, grits,
  preserved figs, salt pork, black-eyed peas, smothered chicken,
  oysters, shrimp, redfish, speckled trout, pain perdu, etc. From three
  years old until today, my greatest food memories were of the cooking
  of Louisiana. I consider myself fortunate to have Creole parents
  raised in Cajun country so that I have been privileged to sample both
  cuisines. Obviously, both the Creole and Cajuns take food as
  seriously as they take anything on earth, more so than the Chinese.
  The latter greet people with "Have you eaten well today?" Creoles and
  Cajuns not only want to know what you have eaten, but what are you
  planning to eat for the remainder of the day as well as for tomorrow?
  Then they will tell you what they have eaten, will eat today and
  what's on the menu for tomorrow. Creoles and Cajuns eat to live.
  Their very existence is food, more food and still more food. They are
  not greedy and certainly not selfish. They will gladly share a meal
  with you, offering the choicest morsels for your pleasure. They have
  adopted the Spanish "my house is your house" philosophy and are happy
  to make sure your stomach is full. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
  CREOLE AND CAJUN COOKING? Most Louisiana chroniclers claim the answer
  is simple. Many Creoles were rich planters and their kitchens aspired
  to grande cuisine. Their recipes came from France or Spain as did
  their chefs. By using classic French techniques with local
  foodstuffs, they created a whole new cuisine, Creole cooking. On the
  other hand, the Acadians, pronounced <uh-CADE-ee-uns>, later
  contracted to Cajun, were a tough people used to living under
  strenuous conditions. They tended to serve strong country food
  prepared from locally available ingredients. It was pungent, peppery
  and practical since it was all cooked in a single pot. Thus Cajun
  cuisine was born. While both cuisines are distinct, there are cross
  references. Rice is a staple of both and Creole and Cajun chefs
  usually start dish by taking a roux of oil and flour. In addition,
  there are many common ingredients such as crab, river shrimp, lhrimp,
  oysters, crawfish, freshwater and saltwater fish, plus squirrels,
  wild turkeys, ducks, frogs, turtles, pork, homemade sausages, beans
  of all kinds, tomatoes, okra, yams, pecans, oranges wines, liqueurs
  and brandy. There is one rule that both the Creoles and Cajuns agree
  upon and that is that there is no one rule and no one recipe when it
  comes to matters of food. There are hundreds of different recipes for
  gumbo, jambalaya, turtle soup and they are all right because no one
  is wrong. Privately, they know that everything they cook is original,
  because their kitchens are kitchens of "ad lib". They are
  experimenting, creating, changing, always trying to make it taste
  better. Because of the changes, it is difficult to get recipes. In
  restaurants, few chefs write recipes down learning from each other in
  the kitchen. In households, Mammas would verbally give the recipe to
  their daughters, who as they cooked the dishes added their own
  flavors and subtle changes. I was 8 years old when I got my first
  cooking lesson from my grandmother's "a pinch of this or a pinch of
  that" cooking school. She was making gumbo using on an old wood
  burning stove. I asked her how much onion she used. Cupping her hands
  she said, "About this much!" Trout Marguery, one of the most popular
  fish dishes in New Orleans, is a good example of the "no written
  recipe". The original dish was thought to have been created here, but
  is believed to have been brought from France by Jean Galatoire, the
  founder of Galatoire's restaurant. It is one of the restaurant's most
  popular dishes, but the original recipe has never been published.
  There are a dozen versions of Trout Marguery plus two schools of
  thought concerning the sauce. One school claims the sauce is based on
  bechamel sauce with fish stock and shrimp added; the second claims
  the sauce is based on hollandaise with seafood stock and shrimp

           THE SO-CALLED "CAJUN FOOD
           -CRAZE"
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
           -~~~
 
  "What real Cajuns ++ the descendents of French Acadians who settled in
  southern Louisiana in the 18th Century ++ eat is frequently spicy but
  rarely incendiary. The spice thing has been blown out of proportion."
  ~ Chef Patrick Mould, C.E.C., Lafayette, Louisiana by Chuck Taggart
  What is real Cajun food? As Michael Doucet said, before about 15
  years ago there was no such thing as "Cajun food" in most people's
  minds, and no such thing as a Cajun restaurant. "There was food
  Cajuns ate,and restuarants where they ate it," says Mike, but "Cajun"
  as descriptive of a style of cooking was unheard-of even in New
  Orleans++ bastion of Creole cuisine ++ 20 years ago. "Then,"
  describes Mike, "Paul Prudhomme burnt a fish and it all went through
  the roof!" Chef Paul Prudhomme, of K-Paul's Restaurant in New Orleans
  and a native of Opelousas, Louisiana, can be given a lot of the
  credit for popularizing-style cooking in America. He has been one of
  Louisiana's most innovative and influential chefs, and has launched
  the careers of many other prominent Louisiana chefs. This dish that
  became his signature was Blackened Redfish, a simple but brilliant
  technique for cooking fish (or steak, chicken, etc.) which involves
  cooking fish dipped in clarified butter and sprinkled with Creole
  seasoning in an iron skillet over incredibly high heat, creating a
  blackened crust and preserving the natural juiciness of the fish. But
  there have been drawbacks to this innovation. Throughout America,
  blackened redfish became synonymous with Cajun food, even though its
  creator does not describe it as such. You'll hear ill-informed people
  talking about how blackening is a "200-year-old Cajun technique",
  when in fact Chef Prudhomme developed it in the late '70s while
  executive Creole seasoning chef at Commander's Palace, and poplarized
  it at K-Paul's. The dish's enormous popularity ended up causing
  redfish to be fished almost to extinction; it is currently illegal to
  serve redfish in Louisiana that has been caught in Gulf waters.
  Myriad so-called "Cajun" restaurants opened all over America to
  capitalize on the craze, many of which were operated by people who
  had no idea what Cajun cuisine was really like, and who served
  execrable food. And somewhere along the line, "Cajun" became
  synonymous with "hot". Cajuns like their food well-seasoned, and this
  seasoning almost always includes black pepper and cayenne pepper, but
  the idea that Cajun food is like regular food with a pound of pepper
  on it is a misconception. Good, well-seasoned food in southwest
  Louisiana will definitely have a zing; the cayenne tends to sneak up
  on you, catching you in the back of your throat, and you notice you
  start to perspire after about six or eight bites. But if Cajun food
  burns your mouth, it means you've  got too much pepper in it. Marc
  Savoy, a musician and accordion-builder in Eunice, Louisiana, and his
  wife Ann are very involved in the preservation of Cajun culture. In
  Les Blank's marvelous documentary film about Cajun and Creole
  cuisine, "Yum! Yum! Yum!", he tells an amusing story about how he
  took his family to Disneyland. They stayed at the Disneyland Hotel,
  which had a nice restaurant. They decided to dine there, and they saw
  a listing on the specials board for "Cajun Fish". Marc mischeviously
  said, "Let's see what they mean by this, "so when the waitress came
  to take their orders he played dumb and asked her (in his thick Cajun
  accent), "What is this word'Cajun', what does that word mean?" She
  was honest and said she didn't know, but she thought it meant a style
  of cooking from New Orleans. "She didn't even know that there was a
  whole culture attached to it," Marc said, "she just thought it was a
  style of cooking." And what's more, the New Orleans cooking style is
  Creole, not Cajun. So he went ahead and ordered it, and when it
  arrived he said it was a nice piece of fish, but he found it inedible
  because it was "absolutely encased in pepper", with a crust of
  cayenne. "I wrapped it in my napkin and took it back to our room,
  went into the bathroom and washed all the pepper off. After that, it
  was a pretty good piece of fish ..." Also, most Cajuns generally do
  not cook with hot chiles such as jalapenos, habaneros, etc. In the
  vast majority of all dishes you'll see that are prepared by actual
  Cajuns, the only main seasonings you'll see are salt, black pepper
  and cayenne pepper. Sometimes the wide variety of hot sauces made in
  Louisiana are used in cooking a swell.

  The so-called "Cajun food craze" that Paul Prudhomme inadvertently
  launched in the early-to-mid '80s when his nouvelle technique of
  blackening redfish caught on ended up creating a lot of
  misconceptions about Cajun food. What we ended up with, all over the
  country, was a glut of so-called "Cajun restaurants" run by
  non-Cajuns who had no idea what they were doing, and who served food
  that actual Cajuns wouldn't eat if their lives depended on it. I once
  stormed out of a so-called "Cajun restaurant" that had opened in West
  Hollywood, with out paying for my uneaten and decidedly inedible
  meal, which included a "gumboquot; that compared poorly to Chef
  Boyardee's ABC soup.
  
  As I mentioned earlier, blackening is NOT a Cajun technique, as its
  inventor Chef Prudhomme freely states. It is a nouvelle American
  technique developed by a Chef who is Cajun, and it was popularized at
  his Cajun restaurant, but almost nobody does that kind of thing at
  home ++ the technique produces so much smoke that you need a
  professional kitchen with an exhaust hood, or you need to do it
  outdoors. What characterizes true, down-home country Cajun food are
  fresh ingredients, locally obtained ++ lots of local seafood and
  vegetables++ and almost always cooked in one pot. For most Cajun
  meals, even if it's for 50 people, you'll generally see one big pot
  with the main dish and one pot of rice. But this is not to say that
  Cajun food isn't changing. Brilliant, innovative Acadiana chefs like
  John Folse, Patrick Mould, James Graham and others are bringing in
  other ingredients, techniques, and sophisticated sauces into
  contemporary Cajun cuisine. They're creating marvelous flavors, and
  they're not encasing their food in hot pepper either! So before you
  enter a Cajun restaurant somewhere out of Louisiana, check and see if
  there's someone from Louisiana in the kitchen. If there is, you're
  probably OK! Article Copyright 1995 Charles E. Taggart

  SOME KEY INGREDIENTS FOR LOUISIANA CUISINE
  ==========================================
  
  Of the rich, complex Creole cuisine of New Orleans and the homey,
  country-style Cajun cuisine of Acadiana (French Louisiana) rely
  heavily on many ingredients that are made and grown locally.
  Substitutions can be made for some, but if you're going for anything
  like the real thing, try to get authentic ingredients. But first, as
  my grandmother says ... "First ya make a roux."Roux. Just as it is in
  classical French cuisine, roux is a mixture of flour and fat, usually
  butter or oil. It is the basis for many Louisiana dishes,
  particularly gumbo, but also etouffees, saucepiquantes, and more.
  There are three basic types of roux: light (or what the Cajuns ++
  call "blond"), medium (or "peanut butter" colored), and dark. There
  is white roux also, which is cooked for just a minute to get the
  flour taste out, but this is rarely used in Louisiana cooking. For
  gumbos, for instance, Creole cooks tend to prefer a blond or medium
  roux, where Cajun cooks tend to prefer a very dark roux, which is
  wonderfully smoky tasting. (There are, of course, exceptions to
  this.) PREPARATION OF ROUX: Preparation of a roux is dependent on
  cooking time; the longer you cook, the darker the roux. A blond roux
  will only take four or five minutes; a dark roux up to 20 or 25
  minutes at high heat, or up to an hour at low heat. Roux must be
  stirred constantly to avoid burning. Constantly means not stopping to
  answer the phone, let the cat in, or flip the LP record over,and if
  you've got to go the bathroom ... hold it in or hand of your whisk or
  roux paddle to someone else. If you see black specks in your roux,
  you've burned it; throw it out and start  over. When you're stirring
  your roux, be very careful not to splatter any on you. It's extremely
  hot, and it sticks. They don't call it Creole napalm for nothing ...
  I have a lovely burn scar on my forearm from last year's Christmas
  Eve gumbo, when I got sloppy with the stirring. Certain dishes (like
  crawfish etouffee) would benefit from a butter-based roux, but if
  you're going to make a dark roux, this will take a longtime. Butter
  roux must be cooked at lowto low-medium heat, or the butter will
  scorch. Darker roux arebetter suited to being made with oil. If you
  know what you're  doing, you can make an oil-based roux over
  medium-high to highwhisking like hell, and you'll have a beautiful
  near-milk-chocolate colored roux in about 20 minutes rather  than an
  hour. Peanut oil works best for high-heat roux cooking. I'm told that
  some home cooks are making roux in the microwave now. "No stirring!",
  they say. "It works!" Bah. Humbug. There'sa certain satisfaction to
  stirring it by hand that I myself refuse to delegate to a microwave.
  Some things simply must be done by hand if you're serious about this.
  CRAWFISH: Then, perhaps the next most important indigenous ingredient
  ... Crawfish. A Louisiana delicacy. Ecrevissein French. Some folks
  call 'em" mudbugs", hillbillies (Jed Clampett, for instance) call
  'em" crawdads", tourists and Yankees call 'em "crayfish". If you goo
  New Orleans and ask for "crayfish", you'll be asked, "Oh hey dawlin',
  where ya from?" They are crawfish. Crawfish have a marvelous,
  delicate flavor, and the crawfish fat adds a mind-bogglingly
  delicious enrichment to sauces and the like. There no substitute for
  crawfish; if you want to make crawfish etouffee and you substitute
  shrimp, you've made shrimpetouffee. Louisiana does export some of its
  crawfish crop (but 90% of it, or about 10 million pounds per year, is
  consumed within the state), so some markets around the US do offer
  them. BEWARE! Crawfish do not keep well, and if they smell or taste
  the least bit "fishy", they're off. Best bet is to have them shipped
  live (or the frozen tails) from a source in Louisiana. SEASONINGS AND
  MEATS: ANDOUILLE: A spicy Louisiana smoked pork sausage. Not to be
  confused with the continental French "andouillette", which is a tripe
  sausage and is icky. Hot smoked sausage of any brand can be
  substituted, but good andouille is a joy. CREOLE HOT SAUSAGE: Regular
  pork sausage from your butcher just won't do. Fortunately,

  it's easy to make it yourself, or you can mail-order it from some
  Louisiana outlets (I'm not sure if Vaucresson's mail orders, but I'll
  check). For southern Californians, Pete's hot sausage is locally made
  by a Louisiana expatriate, and is available at most of the places in
  L.A. listed in the TASSO:
  
  Tasso is a very highly seasoned lean pork butt, used as a seasoning
  meat. It has an intense, delicious flavor, and a little goes a long
  way. I suppose you could substitute smoked ham, but you will not get
  remotely the same flavor. You can obtain tasso from a few mail-order
  sources, but if you have a smoker you can make it yourself.
  SEASONINGS AND CONDIMENTS: CANE SYRUP: The clear or brown syrup made
  from sugar cane, and often used locally instead of maple syrup or
  those thin, nasty, artificially-flavored "pancake syrups". CAYENNE
  PEPPER: Fiery ground red pepper made from the cayenne chile. Powerful
  stuff, and used liberaly in Louisiana cooking, especially in
  combination with white pepper and freshly ground black pepper. CRAB,
  SHRIMP AND CRAWFISH BOIL SPICES: Spices for boiling seafood. They
  come either in a flow-through packet, in dry powdered form, or as a
  liquid concentrate, used to flavor the water in which seafood is
  boiled. It's strong, pungent and spicy. Zatarain's, Rex, Yogi and Tony
  Chachere'sare the prevalent brands. Zatarain's comes in the well-known
  "flow-through" packet; the others are granulated, which you can add
  to the water and/or sprinkle on the seafood itself after boiling.
  CREOLE MUSTARD: A thick, pungent, spicy, coarse local mustard used on
  po-boysas well as an ingredient in many dishes. The mustard seeds are
  marinated before preparation. Most common brands are Zatarain'sand
  Horse Shoe. FILE' POWDER: File' powder is made from dried and ground
  sassafras leaf. It is used as a seasoning and primarily thickening
  agent in gumbo, and has a wonderfully pungent and aromatic flavor.
  Common local brands are Zatarain's, Rex or Yogi. There is no
  substitute. Remember that file' should never be added to a pot of
  gumbo, only to individual servings. If cooked or reheated, it will
  burn stringy. TABASCO: The King of All Pepper Sauces. Available
  worldwide, and made in Avery Island, Louisiana by the McIlhenny
  family since the 1880s. Used as a table sauce and as a cooking
  ingredient. Other good pepper sauces that are not as distinctively
  flavored as and are mellower than Tabasco are Crystal and Louisiana
  RedHot. Sample and pick your favorite, remembering that there are
  over 60 different brands of hot sauces made in Louisiana.

           -shallow dish or pie plate;
           -add
 
  half of beef and toss to coat with flour. 2. In 6-quart pressure
  cooker (see Note), heat 1 T oil over medium-high heat. Add floured
  beef and cook, using slotted spoon, until browned on all sides.
  Remove beef chunks to bowl after they brown. Add remaining oil to
  pan; flour and brown the rest of the beef. Reserve any leftover
  flour. 3. Reduce heat to medium and add onion to cooker; sautd 1
  minute. Add wine and stir to loosen browned-on bits. Add broth,
  tomato paste, bay leaves, and browned beef with accumulated juices.
  Cover pressure cooker and heat over high heat to bring up to full

  minutes. 4. Meanwhile, prepare vegetables: Peel carrots and cut into
  1-inch lengths. Scrub unpeeted potatoes well and cut into halves or
  quarters. Peel celeriac and cut lengthwise into quarters, then slice.
  If using celery, cut into 1-inch lengths. 5. After stew has cooked 15
  minutes, release pressure immediately under cold running water. Add

      Title: Your First Risotto
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Rice
      1    Onion
      4 c  Canned chicken stock
    1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
      1 tb Chopped fresh parsley
      1 tb Butter
      1 tb Olive oil
    1/2 ts Salt
           Generous black pepper
 
  TECHNIQUE - Sauteeing. BEST COOKWARE - Large saucepan, Dutch oven or
  12" skillet. HANDIEST TOOL - Ladle.
  
  Risotto is ladled with mystique. The first thing the risotto police
  would notice about this recipe is that it uses the wrong rice, and
  the chicken stock is at the wrong temperature. Tradition calls for
  short-grain rice from Italy, called Arborio, and warmed broth added
  intermittently to the hot pan. If all you've got is long-grain rice
  and no time to heat a can of chicken stock, you won't ruin risotto.
  
  You have to get everything ready before making risotto. Once you
  start, there are no opportunities to leave the stove.
  
  Measure the rice and have it convenient to the stove.
  
  Peel and halve the onion. Chop the halves into nice-looking, 1/4"
  dice.
  
  Pour the chicken stock into a pot or bowl and set it near the stove
  with a ladle or 1-cup measuring cup. (If you have time, heat the
  stock. Because every time you add stock to the rice, you will be
  cooling the pan. The rice will cook more quickly with heated stock.
  You can warm the stock in a 2-quart glass measuring cup in the
  microwave for 2 minutes on high, or warm it in a pot on the stove.)
  
  Measure the Parmesan and chop the parsley. Choose a pretty bowl for
  serving, and put the Parmesan and parsley near it for quick use.
  
  Put the butter and olive oil in a large pot or skillet. Turn the heat
  to high.
  
  When the butter and oil are very hot and about to sizzle, add the
  onion. With the heat high, saute about 2 minutes, until the onion is
  soft.
  
  Now add all the rice. Stir the grains quickly around the skillet until
  toasty, a good 1 minute.
  
  With a ladle immediately add 1/2 cup of chicken stock, which will
  sizzle. Let it come to a boil, stirring.
  
  When the rice absorbs the stock but the pan still has a small amount
  of liquid, add another 1/2 cup of stock. Let it boil again. Don't add
  more stock until the rice absorbs this addition.
  
  At this point, if the rice is cooking with gentle bubbling, you can
  reduce the heat to medium.
  
  Continue adding stock in 1/2-cup increments and waiting for the rice
  to absorb it, until the rice is plump and no longer firm. You'll have
  to bite on it. The rice will get creamier and creamier.
  
  You'll be at this about 20-25 minutes. You may or may not use up all
  the stock. When the risotto is just about done, you'll find yourself
  stirring more rapidly. It will also draw in less liquid. When you are
  nearing the end, add the salt and pepper.
  
  Transfer the cooked rice to the serving bowl.
  
  Stir in the cheese.
  
  Sprinkle the top with parsley.

  wide spatula to scrape and lift firm portions from pan bottom, so
  uncooked egg can flow beneath.  Cook until eggs are set as firmly as
  you like. Scoop onto plates and season portions to taste with salt,
  pepper and salsa, and accompany with tortillas.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

 Categories: Fish/seafoo, Casseroles
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 cn Cheap water-pak Tuna
           (grated, flake or chunk)
      2 cn Cream of mushroom Soup
      8 oz Shredded cheddar
      2 c  Rice
      1 qt Chicken broth
      8 oz American cheese slices
    1/2 ts White pepper
 
  Cook rice in the chicken broth. While rice is cooking open the tuna
  and use a fork to separate it from packed form into small pieces.
  Transfer cooked rice to a large casserole dish and mix in tuna,
  mushroom soup, shredded cheddar and white pepper. Place in a 325
  degree oven for 20 minutes. Cover top of tuna-rice mixture with
  American cheese slices and return to oven until cheese begins to
  brown or 15 minutes.
  
  At Uncle Dirty Dave's Kitchen we pop the casserole under a broiler
  for a couple of minutes to really brown the cheese topping. Let
  casserole sit for 15 minutes or so before serving. This allows dish
  to "set" so you can serve it like cake or pie. Refrigerate leftovers;
  nukes well. Simple and tasty, my favourite kind of dish.

 Categories: Meats, Caribbean, Holiday
      Yield: 1 servings
 
MMMMM---------------------FROM: BOB SPRINGER--------------------------
 
  Roast pork stars in the traditional "Noche Buena" dinner in Cuban
  homes on Christmas Eve.  The whole family gathers together for a big
  dinner where the roast is surrounded by yuca in mojo, moro, platanos
  (plantains) both "maduro y verde". What sets this pork roast apart
  from others is the seasoning.  The unique combination of garlic,
  oregano, and sour orange juice gives the pork a crisp, tasty crust
  and a sharpness which is a nice counterpoint to the juicy, fatty
  meat. This delicious roast is a breeze to prepare. Make a paste of
  crushed garlic, salt, and oregano. Make small slashes all over the
  outside of the roast. Rub the paste into the slashes. Rub salt all
  over the outside of the pork. Pour the juice of 10 to 12 sour oranges
  over roast and marinate for 24 hours in the refrigerater. Cover roast
  with aluminum foil and place in a pre-heated 350~F. oven. Cook 30
  minutes/pound or until meat begins to seperate from the bone. Remove
  foil 30 minutes before roast is done to give a crisp crust. Saute
  more garlic in a little of the drippings and add sour orange juice to
  make a sauce for the roast. No sour oranges? No problema! Commercial
  brands of this mojo can be found in supermarkets in areas with a
  Cuban population or you can make an acceptable substitute with fresh
  lemons and grapefruit. This roast is a tasty way to say "Feliz
  Navidad". Sour orange sauce is available from "Chez Alberto" 2356 W.

    3/4 c  Milk
    1/4 ts Almond extract
      1    Egg
      2 ts Butter; melted
           Oil
 
  Filling:  Combine chocolate chips and butter in the top of a double
  boiler; bring water to a boil.  Reduce heat to low; cook, stirring
  often, until chocolate melts.  Remove from heat.  Add confectioners'
  sugar, Karo, creme de cacao, water, and vanilla, and stir until
  smooth.
  
  Spoon about 3 tablespoons ice cream down the center of each cr#pe;
  fold sides over, and place seam side with on serving dishes.  Spoon
  warm chocolate sauce over each; sprinkle with pecans.
  
  Cr#pes:  Combine flour, cocoa, sugar, and salt.  Add milk and almond
  extract; beat until smooth.  Add egg and beat well; stir in butter.
  Refrigerate 2 hours.
  
  Brush bottom of a 6" cr#pe pan or heavy skillet with oil; place over

  Pour 2 tablespoons batter into pan; quickly tilt pan in all
  directions so batter covers the pan in a thin film.  Cook 1 minute or
  until lightly browned.
  
  Lift edge of cr#pe to test for doneness.  Cr#pe is ready for flipping
  when it can be shaken loose from the pan.  Flip the cr#pe, and cook
  about 30 seconds on the other side. (This side is rarely more than
  spotty brown, and is the side on which the filling is placed.) Place
  cr#pes on a towel to cool.  Stack between layers of waxed paper to
  prevent sticking. Repeat until all batter is used.

      2 lg Eggs
    120 g  Plain (all-purpose) flour
      1 pn Salt
           Pepper; freshly ground
      3 dl Milk
      2 tb Cold water
           Few chives; snipped
      1 sm Handful of parsley
           Some fresh tarragon leaves
      2    Sprigs of fresh dillweed
           -Filling
    450 g  Goat's cheese; rind removed
      2    Egg whites
 
  (Units: 100 g = 3 1/2 oz; 1 dl = 3 1/2 fl oz = 2/5 cup; 180 oC = 350
  oF; 200 oC = 400 oF; 230 oC = 450 oF; 250 oC = 475 oF; 2.5 cm = 1
  inch)
  
  (Two crepes per person for a first course, serve with the tomato
  sauce)
  
  Break the eggs into a liquidizer or food processor and add the flour,
  salt and pepper to taste. Whiz, gradually adding the milk and water.
  Add the snipped chives, which unless snipped just wrap themselves
  around the blades, and the other herbs and whiz until the herbs are
  fine. Pour the crepe batter into a jug and leave to stand for half an
  hour.
  
  To cook the crepes, melt a small amount of butter, about 1 1/2 ts, in
  a crepe or omelette pan, and swirl it over the surface of the pan.
  Pour in just enough batter to cover the bottom of the pan, swirling
  the batter around so that the crepe will be as thin as possible. Over
  a moderate heat, cook for about 30 seconds, then turn the crepe over
  using a small palette knife or spatula and your fingers.
  
  As they are cooked, stack the crepes with a piece of greaseproof (wax)
  paper between each, to prevent them sticking together.
  
  For the filling, put the cheese into a food processor with the egg
  whites and whiz until smooth.
  
  Put a generous teaspoonful of filling in the middle of each crepe and
  fold into a fat rectangle. Put the stuffed crepes into an oiled or
  buttered heatproof dish and brush them with melted butter. Bake in a
  preheated moderate oven 180 oC for 20 minutes.

  This book has some great recipes but they are not carefully edited
  and do contain some obvious mistakes.  But I usually read the recipes
  care- fully and make any adjustments that I think they should have
  said <grin>. I have tried a few from this book and we loved them all.
  
  BTW, the book is divided into the seven deadly sins; this is from the
  sin of gluttony (one of my favorite sins...).

     10 oz Frozen peas;  (this was a
           -bit too much, use about 7
           -oz instead)
      2 c  Chicken/turkey, cooked;
           Chopped
      2 tb Pimiento, chopped
           Paprika (opt)

MMMMM---------------------------CREPES--------------------------------
      1 c  Flour
  1 1/2 c  Milk
      2    Eggs
      1 tb Cooking oil
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  (Note:  make crepes *first*; then they'll be ready when the sauce and
  filling are finished.)
  
  Crepes: Mix all crepe ingredients in a bowl and beat with a rotary
  beater till blended.
  
  Heat a lightly greased 6-inch skillet.  Remove from heat.  Spoon in
  about 2 Tablespoons of batter; lift and tilt skillet to spread
  batter. Return to heat; brown on one side only.  (Or, cook on an
  inverted crepe pan.) Invert pan over paper toweling; remove crepe.
  Repeat to make 16- 18 crepes; greasing skillet occaionally.
  
  Unfilled crepes freeze well, so if you have any remaining crepes,
  store them in your freezer.  Just make a stack, alternating each
  crepe with 2 layers of waxed paper.  Then overwrap the stack in a
  moisture-vaporproof bag.  Freeze up to 4 months.  Let crepes thaw at
  room temperatur about1 hour before using.
  
  Cheese sauce:  In a medium sucepan melt butter.  Stir in flour and
  salt. Add milk, water and chicken bouillon granules all at once. Cook
  and stir over medium heat till thickened and bubbly.  Cook and stir
  1-2 minutes more.  Stir in cheese, wine, parsley and Tabasco. Remove
  1 cup of the cheese sauce and set aside.  Stir drained mushrooms into
  remaining sauce.
  
  Filling: Cook peas acording to package directions; drain.  Combine
  peas, chicken/turkey, pimiento and the 1 cup reserved cheese sauce.
  Spread about 1/4 cup filling over the unbrowned side of each crepe,
  leaving a 1/4-inch rim around edge.  Roll up crepe.  Place, seam side
  down, in a 12x7x2 inch baking dish.  Repeat with remaining crepes.
  Pour the remaining cheese sauce over crepes.  Sprinkle with paprika,
  if desired. Cover; bake in a 375~ oven for 18-20 minutes or till
  heated through. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
  
  (My notes:  making the crepes is a *real* pain.  Time-consuming.  Make
  enough crepes to finish this recipe then while it's heating through,
  finish the rest of the crepes & freeze  OR halve the recipe & make
  less crepes.
  
  Use less than 10-oz of peas.  This amount seems to be too much.)

      4 c  Heavy cream
           Salt; to taste
           White pepper; to taste
  1 1/2 c  Swiss cheese; grated
 
  Crepes:  Place eggs, milk and butter in blender; add flour and blend
  about 1 minute, until smooth.  Refrigerate batter at least 2 hours
  and as long as 12 hours before making crepes.  To cook crepes, pour 3
  tablespoons batter into greased, heated crepe pan or small skillet;
  cook until done on one side (it is not necessary to cook crepes on
  both sides). To assemble crepes, blend half the Crab Filling with the
  Swiss Cheese Sauce; correct seasoning.  Place a large spoonful crab
  mixture on each crepe and roll; place seam side down in two buttered
  large rectangular glass baking dishes. Spoon remaining crab mixture
  over crepes; sprinkle with grated cheese and dot with butter. Bake
  uncovered in preheated 400'F. oven 20 minutes, until hot and bubbly.
  This dish may be frozen or refrigerated before serving; if chilled,
  remove from refrigerator 30 minutes before baking.
  
  Crab Filling:  Melt butter in skillet; stir in green onions and
  crabmeat. Mix lightly and cook a few minutes; add seasonings.  Add
  vermouth and boil rapidly until liquid is almost evaporated.  Scrape
  from skillet into bowl; reserve.
  
  Swiss Cheese Sauce:  Blend cornstarch and milk; reserve.  Put
  vermouth in same skillet that filling was cooked in; boil rapidly
  until vermouth is reduced to 2 tablespoons.  Remove from heat; stir
  in cornstarch and milk mixture.  Return skillet to low heat and add
  cream slowly, along with salt and pepper; cook several minutes until
  slightly thickened. Stir in cheese and cook until melted and
  well-blended; correct seasoning.
  
  NOTE: This recipe makes enough crepes to fill two baking dishes.

      Title: Chicken Like The Kernel's
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 pk Good Seasonings Italian or
           -Mild Italian Salad Dressing
           -mix
           Used right from the package.
      3 tb Flour
      2 ts Salt (that's not too much)
    1/4 c  Lemon juice (or vinegar)
      2 tb Margarine or cooking oil
 
  "Chicken Like `The Kernel's'
  
  Begin with about 3 lbs fryer parts. Cut the breast pieces in half.
  Fries quickly when the pieces are small.
  
  Make a paste of the following:
  
  Spread this paste evenly over chicken pieces; stack in a bowl; cover
  and refrigerate at least two hours or better yet, overnight. About 1
  hour before serving, heat about 1 1/2 pints cooking oil in heavy
  saucepan (9 inches in diameter, with depth of oil about 3 inches) to
  a temperature of 425 degrees.
  
  I prefer my Oster Super Cooker--but using an electric deep fryer I
  would have the temperature at 400 degrees. Put about 2 cups milk or
  Club Soda or beer in a deep, narrow bowl & dip each piece chicken in
  the liquid, letting the excess drip off. Dust lightly but evenly in
  Aunt Jemima Pancake Flour (or a good brand). DO NOT OVERCOAT!!! Dry
  pieces a few minutes without letting them touch each other. Fry few
  pieces at a time. Place on a cookie sheet without letting them touch
  each other and bake uncovered 350 degrees 30 minutes. Serves about 6
  to 8 people.
  
  I encourage you to experiment with amount of salad dressing mix
  according to your own taste preferences. But much of it washes off in
  milk so 2 pkgs needed!
  
  Cracklin Good Gravy Blend till smooth 1 c water & 1/4 cup cornstarch
  (in blender). In sauce pan over medium heat combine this with 10-oz
  can Banquet Chicken Broth or home made stock, 2 chicken bouillon
  cubes, two (10-oz ea) cans Franco American Beef Gravy. Stir until
  thick & clear. Serve over chicken, thoroughly heated. Serves 6
  nicely. A PINCH of sage to this does wonders for flavor. Bouillon
  powder may be substituted for the cubes if you wish."

  turning once, until crisp and golden on both sides. Lift out on a
  slotted spoon, let the oil drain for a fews seconds, then drop the
  hot jelebi into the syrup and soak it for a minute or two. Lift out
  of the syrup (using another slotted spoon) and put on a plate to
  drain.
  
  Syrup: Heat sugar and water over low heat, stirring until sugar
  dissolves. Raise heat and boil hard for 8 minutes; syrup should be
  just thick enough to spin a thread. Remove from heat, allow to cool
  until lukewarm, flavour with rose essence (about 1.2 tsp of good
  quality essence is sufficient) and colour a bright orange with food
  colouring.
  
  *Jelebis are coils of crisply fried batter with a rose-scented syrup
  inside the coils. How the syrup gets into the coils is a mystery
  unless you do some research on the subject.
  
  This is a traditionally festive sweet. (Moghul custom)

      Yield: 4 servings
 
    300 g  Paneer
    175 g  Ricotta cheese
    350 g  Sugar
  1 1/4 l  Water
 
  Rube the *paneer and ricotta cheese with palm of your hand until

  *PANEER (Home-made cottage cheese) 3.5 litres milk about 250ml warm
  water about 5 Tbsp white vinegar
  
  1. Bring the milk to the boil, stirring constantly, over a high heat.
  Remove from heat.
  
  2. Combine the water and vinegar.
  
  3. Slowly add the vinegar solution to the boiled milk, stirring with a
  wooden spoon. As soon as the milk curdles, do not add any more. (The
  curd and whey will separate.)
  
  4. Place three or four layers of cheesecloth in a sieve and strain the
  curdled milk through them. Ties up the ends of the cheesecloth and
  squeeze out as much of the liquid as possible. Hang it up to drain
  thoroughly.
  
  Note: When adding the water and vinegar mixture to the milk, do not
  add more than necessary as this tends to harden the paneer.

  the chicken broth and water to cover the bird, then bring to a boil
  over high heat, uncovered. When the liquid starts to boil, add the
  barley and all remaining ingredients except the dill; stir. When the
  soup returns to a boil, reduce heat to a gentle simmer and cook,
  partially covered, for 1 hour or until the chicken is cooked through
  and vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally.
  
  3. Remove the chicken from the pot. When cool enough to handle,
  discard the skin, shred the meat into large pieces and return about a
  third of it to the pot. (Save the remaining meat for another use,
  such as a salad.) Just before serving, stir in the dill.

      8    Peeled and deveined shrimp,
           -rinsed and patted dry
    3/4 lb Bay scallops, rinsed and
           -patted dry
      1 c  Chopped flat-leaf parsley
 
  The cookbook author and writer Michael McLaughlin cooked up this
  marvelous soup in 1982, and it has remained a mainstay in my kitchen
  ever since. For ease in preparation, make the broth ahead of time.
  The soup can almost be completed the morning before serving; simply
  add the shellfish at the end. If its "beard" is removed, a mussel
  will die. So, to keep mussels fresh, don't remove their beards until
  just before adding to the soup.
  
  1. Place the oil in a large, heavy pot. Add the onions, peppers and
  garlic. Cook over low heat, covered, until vegetables are tender,
  about 20 minutes.
  
  2. Add fish broth, wine, tomatoes, basil, thyme and bay leaf. Season
  to taste with salt, pepper and red pepper flakes. Bring to a boil,
  reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, for 30
  minutes. (Can be made one day ahead and refrigerated.)
  
  3. Scrub the mussels and clams well. Don't remove mussels' beards
  until just before use. Place shellfish in the bottom of a heavy pot.
  Add 1" of water and place over high heat to steam shells open. As
  they open, remove mussels and clams one by one with a slotted spoon;
  reserve.
  
  4. Five minutes before serving, bring wine mixture to a boil. Drop in
  the shrimp and scallops, then the clams and mussels in their shells.
  Add parsley, stir well and remove from heat. Let stand, covered, for
  1 minute.
  
  5. Ladle into shallow bowls, dividing the seafood equally. Serve
  immediately.

      Title: Anchor Bar Hot Wings - Gbgm64a G.schaeffer
 Categories: Appetizers, Poultry
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      1 x  Chicken wings
      1 x  Read below
 
  The key to good Buffalo Wings is how you prepare them as well as the
  ingredients and the handling of the wings. The most successful wings
  served up here in Buffalo are what they call "Grade A Grinders."
  Fresh wings that are very large and meaty.  Usually, you cannot get
  them in a frozen package, but can get them from a poultry dealer.
  Once you find them make sure they are absolutely fresh. Wash them in
  cold water, split them at the joint and remove the tips. Place them
  on a rack on a pan and refrigerate overnight to let the blood and
  water drain out of the wings. THIS IS A REAL KEY.  Drying the wings
  under refrigeration will help to make them a much crispier product,
  once deep fried. Next, use a deep fryer or a very heavy deep pot with
  a thermometer and add the oil. Peanut oil is very good, or a
  commercial product such as can be found at a restaurant cash and
  carry called Mel Fry. Heat the oil up SLOWLY, to 365F, and depending
  on the size of the fryer, deep fry the dry wings 6-8 minutes in small
  batches, until thoroughly done and golden brown. Hold the cooked
  wings in a warm oven if necessary. A combination of melted margarine
  and hot sauce in the ratio of 1 part margarine to 3 parts hot sauce
  will add the right zing. The key here is to add just enough sauce to
  coat the wings - the more sauce you add, the hotter they will be.
  For the very brave, 1 part margarine to 3 parts hot sauce and 1 part
  Tabasco is referred to as "Suicidal Wings" by the late and dear Don
  Bellissimo, who owned the Anchor Bar. Working quickly, place the deep
  fried wings in a large bowl and add the sauce mixture, shaking to
  coat them. There are many good hot sauces to use; the one they use is
  either Durkee Franks Red Hot Sauce or Wingers Original, again found
  in a restaurant cash and carry. Celery sticks and chunky blue cheese
  dressing (Ken's Buffalo Style Blue Cheese is a popular one) and
  plenty of napkins.

  crosswise and remove seeds.  Trim stems but do not make a hole. 2.
  Parboil peppers in simmering, salted water until just tender, then
  drain peppers. 3. Break eggs 2 eggs into each pepper half.  Season
  and top with a 1/2 tablespoon slice of butter.  Place peppers in
  small baking pan, pour in 1 inch of hot poaching water, and bake
  briefly at 375 degrees until eggs set. 4. Ribbon with tomato sauce.
  
  My suggestions.  Try a spice such as Szechuan Style Pepper or Herb
  Pepper Blend instead of the salt and pepper.  (Szechuan is copied
  from the label of a McCormick spice jar.  Spell checker suggests the
  spelling Szechwan.)
  
  This also could be cooked at a low at a medium setting in a microwave
  oven.

  processor puree basil, parsley, garlic, avocado, oil, 2 tbsp of the
  Parmensan cheese, stock and lemon juice until smooth. Pour over
  pasta. Sprinkle with pine nuts and remaining Parmensan cheese. Toss.
  
  tips:  Even with lemon juice the pesto may discolour, if this
  happens, skim off the darkened surface and discard.  Toast pine nuts
  in a skillet on stove top for 2 to 3 minutes until brown.  This is
  like a guacamole dressing with much less fat due to the basil and
  parsley. For a stronger flavor use all basil and no parsley.

           Pieces)
           Sprigs of fresh thyme or
           Rosemary, for garnish (opt.)
 
  To make the vegetable minestrone, heat the oil in a large saucepan
  over medium heat.  Add the garlic and cook just until it starts to
  sizzle; do not brown.  Add the herbs, juice, stock and peper and
  bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 3 minutes.  Set
  aside.
  
  To make the couscous, combine the stock, pepper, herbs and oil in a
  small saucepan and bring to a boil.  Add the couscous, mix well and
  remove from the heat.  Cover tightly and allow to stand for at least
  5 minutes, or until all of the liquid has been absorbed.  Set aside.
  
  Wash the swordfish and pat it dry.  Rub the surface with a little
  olive oil and sprinkle with salt, freshly ground black pepper and
  herbs, if desired. Cook over a charcoal grill or under a broiler just
  until it turns from translucent to opaque, about 3 to 4 minutes per
  side.  Do not overcook or the fish will become tough.
  
  To serve, place a rounded 1/2 cup of couscous on each of 4 plates and
  top with a piece of grilled swordfish.  Spoon the minestrone around
  each serving, dividing it equally.  Garnish each serving with a sprig
  of fresh thyme or rosemary, if desired.

  Meantime put margarine and sugar in bowl and cream it. Add egg and
  level tbsp flour and beat well. Add remainder of flour, 1 tbsp at a
  time. Mixture should look like very thick cream. (If too thick add
  spot of warm water.)
  
  Syrup should now be melted. Take it out. Drain pineapple and place 3
  rings in the syrup. Add mixture on top. Smooth over with knife. Clean
  sides of dish.
  
  Return to oven for approx. 1/2 an hour. When cooked turn out on
  cooling tray, allowing excess syrup to drain away. Put half cherry in
  centre of each pineapple ring (angelica leaves too ad lib.) Serve on
  pretty dish.
  
  I loved this pudding as a child. It comes out like a sticky sponge,
  and is best served with custard on a cold day.

      Title: Sesame Chicken
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/4 c  Chicken stock
      6 tb Fresh lemon juice
      3 tb Sugar
      2 ts Grated lemon zest
      2 ts Plum sauce
    3/4 c  All purpose flour
      2    Eggs, beaten
    1/2 c  White sesame seeds
      2 ts Salt
      1 ts Ground white pepper
      4    Skinless, boneless chicken
           -breast halves
      6 tb Peanut oil
      1 ts Minced fresh ginger
      1 ts Minced garlic
      1 tb Cornstarch mixed with 1-1/2
           -tbps water
 
  Chicken breasts are lightly breaded and then pan fried to reduce the
  calories in classic lemon chicken. While it may be tempting to reduce
  the sugar in the sauce, remember that sugar accentuates the tartness
  of lemon.
  
  SAUCE
  
  sliced scallion greens for garnish
  
  combine the sauce ingredients in a bowl and reserve.  To prepare the
  breading, place 1/4 cup of the flour in a large shallow bowl or
  plate. In another bowl, beat the eggs, and in a third, combine the
  remaining 1/2 cup of flour with sesame seeds and salt and pepper.
  Arrange these next to each other on a counter. Wash the chicken
  breasts and trim any excess fat. Pound with a mallet or rolling pin
  to 1/4 inch thickness. Then dip, one at a time, first in the flour.
  Pat off any excess and dip in the egg. Lift the meat, allowing excess
  egg to drain back into bowl,and then dip and coat with the flour and
  sesame seed batter. Reserve on a platter. Heat 4 tbsp of the peanut
  oil in a 10 inch skillet over medium high heat. Fry the chicken
  breasts, two at a time, until golden,3-4 minutes per side. (Reduce
  the heat to medium if the chicken is browning to quickly) Reserve on
  a platter. While the last batch is finishing, heat the remaining 2
  tbsp of oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Saute the ginger and
  garlic until their aroma is released and then pour in the sauce. When
  it comes to a boil, reduce to lowest heat.  Drizzle in the cornstarch
  mixture while stirring constantly, and remover from heat as soon as
  the sauce thickens. To serve, slice each chicken breast into 1/2 inch
  strips along the width and place on dinner plates.  Spoon on the
  sauce and garnish with scallions. Serves 4.

      Title: Asparagus and Sesame Chicken Soup
 Categories: Chinese, Poultry, Soup/stew
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Chicken
      3 tb Sesame oil
      6    Slices ginger root
    1/2 c  Medium sherry
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Warm water
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2 c  Button mushrooms, canned
      8    Fresh asparagus spears
 
  Preparation:  Rinse chicken, remove fat pockets, pat dry, and chop
  into bite-size pieces.  NOTE:  if tempted to use breast meat without
  bones, please don`t; bones add to body and flavor of soup. Peel and
  slice ginger root.  Wash and cut asparagus into 2" sections.
  
  Braising:  Heat wok to medium hot.  Add sesame oil. Start braising
  chicken a few pieces at a time when oil begins to smell. Sesame oil
  will burn at lower temperature than other cooking oils, so avoid hot
  wok. After browning lightly, return chicken pieces to wok; add ginger
  slices, sherry and salt. When sherry boils, add water and sugar. Turn
  up heat, bring to boil, then reduce heat to simmer, cover and simmer
  for 30 minutes. Add mushrooms and asparagus, simmer for another 15
  minutes.
  
  Transfer to covered soup tureen (or put plate on top of soup bowl),
  place in steamer on low, and hold until ready to serve.
  
  You can make this soup in large sauce pan, if wok is needed for
  something else.

      Title: Sesame Chicken Salad
 Categories: Chinese, Salads, Poultry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 tb Sesame seeds
      3    Whole chicken breasts
      6 c  Water
      2 tb Soy sauce
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Fivespice powder
      3    Stalks celery
      1 tb Sesame oil
      1 tb Vegetable oil
    1/4 ts Ground ginger
    1/8 ts Pepper
 
  This is a bit more substantial than what one usually thinks of when
  dealing with Chinese Chicken Salad. The chicken breasts are cooked in
  the Chinese manner by boiling and then steeping off the heat. This
  gives chicken that is cooked but extremely juicy and tender.
  
  1. Sprinkle sesame seeds into small, shallow baking pan or cookie
  sheet with sides. Bake in preheated 350 degrees F (180 C) oven until
  golden, 5 to 8 minutes.
  
  2. Combine chicken, water, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of the soy sauce, the
  salt and fivespice powder in 3 or 4-quart (3 or 4 L) sauce- pan.
  Cover and cook over high heat until water boils. Reduce heat and
  simmer 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Let chicken stand in water
  1 hour.
  
  3. Remove chicken from water (reserve water) and drain. Remove and
  discard chicken bones. Cut meat into 1/2-inch (1.5 cm) wide slices.
  
  4. Cut celery into diagonal slices. Heat reserved water over high heat
  until it boils. Add celery and cook until crisp-tender, 1 to 2
  minutes. Drain celery well.
  
  5. Combine remaining 1 tablespoon (15 mL) soy sauce with oils, ginger
  and pepper in large bowl. Add chicken and celery. Toss until
  completely combined. Transfer mixture to serving dish. Sprinkle with
  sesame seeds.

      Title: Eggplant In Tomato-Wine Sauce
 Categories: Vegetables, Salsa/sauce
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2    + cups dry pasta shells (I
           Used small shells)
    1/3    Water
    1/4 c  Vinger (favorite flavor, I
           Used white)
      1 lg Eggplant, peeled and cubed
      1 sm Red onion, chopped
    1/2    To  1 cup mushrooms,
           Chopped
      1    Green pepper, chopped
    1/2 c  Chopped chives
      2 tb Finely chopped/minced
           Garlic
      1 md Tomatoe, chopped
     10 oz Tomatoe sauce
      4 tb Oregono (adjust, start w/3
           Also try italian herbs)
    1/8    To 1/2 tsp salt (taste)
      1 ea Ground pepper (fresh best)
    1/4 c  Red wine
 
  Cook pasta shells.  While cooking pasta heat a large skillet with the
  water and vinegar. When getting hot add the cubed eggplant, onion,
  chives, garlic, green peppers, and mushrooms. Saute till soft (I
  sauted at fairly high heat for about 15-20 minutes stirring a lot. I
  like eggplant to be prettty).  When done add to the pasta along with
  the tomato sauce, oregano, salt, pepper and red wine. stir and heat
  gently (on low). This was actually fairly easy to make, the only time
  consuimg paret was peeling the eggplant and chopping veges.

      Title: Chicken in Sun-Dried Tomato Cream Sauce
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 c  Dry-packed sun-dried
           -tomatoes
      1 tb Butter
      1 md Garlic clove, minced
      1 c  Chicken stock or low-salt
           -broth, divided
      1 c  Heavy cream
      1 lb Boneless and skinless
           -chicken breast halves
           Salt and freshly ground
           -black pepper to taste
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      2 tb Chopped fresh basil (or 2
           -tsp dried, crumbled)
      8 oz Fettucine
 
  Snip the tomatoes into bite-size pieces.  Melt the butter in a
  saucepan over low heat; add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds.  Add
  3/4 cup of the stock and the tomatoes.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce the
  heat and simmer, uncovered, over medium heat for about 10 minutes or
  until the tomatoes are tender.  Add the cream and bring to a boil,
  stirring. Simmer over medium heat until the sauce is thick enough to
  coat the back of a spoon. (The sauce can be kept, covered, for 1 day
  in the refrigerator. Heat again over low heat.)
  
  Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides.  Heat the
  oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the chicken
  and saute, pressing on the chicken occasionally with a slotted
  spatula, for about 4 minutes per side or until the meat feels springy
  and is no longer pink inside (cut to check).  Transfer to a board;
  cover and keep warm.
  
  Discard the fat from the skillet.  Add the remaining stock and bring
  to a boil, stirring up the pan juices.  Boil to reduce slightly, then
  add to the sauce.  Stir in the basil.  Taste and adjust the seasoning.
  
  Meanwhile, cook the pasta, uncovered, in a large port of boiling
  salted water over high heat, stirring occasionally (about 1 to 2
  minutes for fresh or 3 to 5 minutes for dried fettucine), or until
  tender but firm to the bite (al dente).  Drain, transfer to bowl and
  toss with 3 or 4 tablespoons of the sauce.
  
  Cut each chicken breasts into 2 or 3 diagonal slices.  Reheat gently
  in the sauce if needed.  Transfer the pasta to serving plates, top
  with the chicken and coat with sauce.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

  NOTE:  I HATE the taste of creamy tuna fish with eggs, and I'm always
         watching my fat content.  Here's a great (modified) recipe from
         the LA Times.  Very easy to make, and super tasty...
  
  Adjust all ingredients to your personal taste.  But the combination of
  ingredients always makes this taste great.
  
  Serve with pita breads or with a salad for a light and spicy lunch.

      Title: Sauteed Salmon with Asparagus and Fresh Dill
 Categories: Fish/seafoo
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           -JUDI M. PHELPS (QNTJ65A)
    1/2 md Red onion
      2 md Red potatoes (about 3/4 lb)
      1 lb Fresh asparagus
      2 tb Fresh squeezed lemon juice
      1 lb Salmon steaks
      1 tb Olive oil
      4    Garlic cloves; minced
    1/4 ts Salt
           Pepper to taste
    1/4 c  Fresh dill; minced
      6    Wedges lemon
 
  Cut the onion in half lengthwise and slice thinly. Scrub the potatoes
  and dice them; do not peel.  Snap off and discard the rough stem ends
  of the asparagus and cut the stalks at a slant into 2-inch lengths.
  Heat 3/4 cup water and the lemon juice to a boil in a skillet that
  has a tight-fitting lid.  Rinse the salmon and place into the boiling
  water. Cover, reduce heat to low, and poach for 4 minutes, then turn,
  cover, and cook 3 to 5 minutes longer, depending on the thickness of
  the fish.  Fish is done when mostly opaque but still barely
  translucent at the very center. Remove from the water and set aside
  on a tea towel.
  
  Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan or skillet over medium heat.
  Add garlic and stir for a moment or two, then add the onion and
  potatoes and saute 7 minutes, stirring frequently.  Add the
  asparagus, salt, and pepper and saute, stirring frequently 7 minutes
  more, until asparagus is fork tender. Meanwhile, remove any skin and
  bones from the salmon and break up into bite-size pieces. Add to the
  skillet along with the fresh dill, toss to combine well, and heat
  through for one minute. Serve very hot, passing the lemon wedges.

    1/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
      1 lg Onion; chopped
      3 lg Garlic cloves; chopped
    1/4 ts Crushed hot pepper flakes
      2    Celery ribs; chopped
      2 md Carrots; peeled and chopped
      1 c  Dry red wine
     28 oz Can Italian crushed tomatoes
           -(in puree)
  1 1/2 c  Water
      1 tb Fresh oregano; chopped OR
      1 ts Dried oregano
      1 ts Fresh rosemary ; chopped OR
    1/8 ts Dried rosemary
     12    Crab claws; cracked and
           -preferably Dungeness, fresh
           -or defrosted frozen
     12    To 14 clams; soft-shell or
           -cherrystones; scrubbed
           -clean
     12    To 14 mussels; scrubbed
           -clean
      3 tb Fresh parsley;chopped
      2 tb Fresh basil; chopped OR
      1 ts Dried basil
           Crusty Italian bread
           Freshly ground pepper
 
  In a nonreactive large, flameproof casserole, heat olive oil over
  medium heat.  Cook onion 3 to 4 minutes, or until softened.  Add
  garlic and hot pepper flakes and cook 30 seconds, or until fragrant.
  Stir in celery and carrots and cook until softened and just turning
  golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Add wine, tomatoes, water, oregano, and
  rosemary. Cook, uncovered, over medium heat until liquid is reduced
  by one fourth, 8 to 10 minutes.
  
  Add crab and cover.  Cook over medium-high heat 3 minutes.  Add clams
  and mussels and cook until opened and crab claws are bright red, 3 to
  4 minutes longer.  Discard any clams or mussels that did not open.
  Sprinkle with parsley and basil.  Serve in shallow soup bowls with
  thick crusty bread, passing a pepper mill on the side.
  
  Judi's Notes:  The above recipe is a basic Cioppino recipe.  I usually
  double the amount of tomatoes and wine and add 1/2 cup of clam juice
  to the tomato wine mixture. I add an extra garlic clove, and then add
  about 1/2 lb each scallops and shrimp and a couple pieces of firm
  fish such as halibut, swordfish, or whatever is in season. Be sure to
  add the scallops and shrimp at the very end of the cooking time or
  they will be too tough to even eat and will taste like rubber. Make
  sure you have plenty of napkins, seafood shell crackers, and a plate
  or bowl for discarded shells. Enjoy!

      3 lb Brown sugar

      1 ts Nutmeg
      1 ea Orange w/peel; chopped
 
  Grind tomatoes, drain well (use coarse knife on blender or grinder).
  Measure juice and discard.  Put same amount of water in tomato
  mixture and bring to a boil, drain again, measure juice and discard.
  Put same amount of water (as juice discarded) and bring to a boil
  again. Drain well, add remaining ingredients to and including
  vinegar. Cook until mixture is clear.  Add spices and cook until
  thick.
  
  Put into jars and seal.  Does not need cold packing.  Do not put
  spices in until after mixture cooks clear, then add spices & cook
  about 3-4 hours until thick.
  
  Notes:
  
  We couldn't find beef suet, so we substituted fat trimmings from beef.
  
  We packed it hot into jars and processed it in a pressure canner, 10
  minutes @ 10 psi pressure.  This is for our altitude at @ 5000 feet,
  and should probably be less for lower altitudes.  It worked well for
  us this way.

  The trick to making 100% whole wheat bread in your machine is an extra
  knead, which gives the yeast and gluten a second chance to create a
  lighter loaf.  When your first knead cycle is completed, simply reset
  the machine and start again - or use the whole wheat cycle, if it's
  available on your machine.

  If your market doesn't stock wheat gluten, try your local health food
  store.
  
  Remember the extra knead (as usual for wheat bread) - it's especially
  important for 100% whole wheat bread!  You should use only the
  regular bake cycle.

  adding water, a tablespoon at a time, during the kneading until dough
  appears moist and pliable.

    3/4 c  Water
      2 c  White bread flour
      1 ts Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      1    Egg, beaten

  Saffron is the world's most expensive spice - 225,000 crocus stigmas
  are needed to make a single pound!  The texture and flavor of this
  light and fluffy loaf will convince you it's worth it.  This is bread
  for a special occasion - or bread that will make any occasion
  special. The distinctive old world flavor works majic with seafood
  and hearty soups like lentil or sausage.

                                 -------------
  
  If using saffron threads, grind to a coarse powder-like consistency
  using a mortar and pestle.  The fresh powder will be more potent than
  the pre-ground so you'll need less.
  
  Once opened, the intensity of a vial of saffron will diminish.
  
  Use regular or rapid bake cycle.

  This heavy, dark bread is a traditional pumpernickel - the kind that
  will have you reaching for smoked salmon and cream cheese.  The loaf
  is shorter and denser than most becaue of the heavy flours, which
  call for an extra knead.  With bread machins, that simply means one
  extra button to push.

  restart the machine after the first knead.

  You may love your peaches & cream chilled, but the way to serve this
  lovely light bread is warm from the oven.  Like your favorite peach
  cobbler, the subtle richness of the flavors lends itself perfectly to
  a light topping of fresh butter.  Try it for bread & butter
  sandwiches and you may decide to make afternoon tea a ritual!
  
                             Success Hints
                             -------------
  
  For a creamy texture, use low fat yogurt; if you're calorie-counting,
  nonfat will do.
  
  For more of a cobbler effect, increase nutmeg and cinnamon to taste.
  
  The crust tents to be dark; you might want to try the "light" crust
  setting.
  
  Use regular or rapid bake cycle.

      Title: Baked Salmon on a Bed of Leeks
 Categories: Fish/seafoo
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 md Leeks, about 1 1/2 lb
      4    Salmon fillets, 6-8 oz each
      4 tb Lime juice
      4 tb Olive oil
      4 ts Honey
      1 tb Finely minced fresh ginger
           Salt to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
           -to taste
      2 tb Fresh snipped chives, for
           -garnish
      2    Limes, halved, for garnish
 
  When there's citrus juice in a marinade, it is important not to let
  the fish sit longer than 30 minutes, because the citrus will "cook"
  the fish.
  
  1. Trim the leeks, leaving 3" of green on. Cut the leeks into
  juliennes (very thin strips, about 4" by 1/8"). Wash well in a
  strainer to remove all dirt. Blanch in boiling, salted water for 2
  minutes; drain.
  
  2. Preheat the oven to 450'F.
  
  3. Place the salmon fillets in a glass or ceramic dish to fit. For
  marinade, combine 2 tablespoons lime juice, 1 tablespoon olive oil,
  the honey, ginger, salt and pepper. Pour over salmon and refrigerate,
  covered, for 30 minutes.
  
  4. While salmon marinates, toss the leeks with the remaining lime
  juice, up to 3 tablespoons of olive oil (use less oil, if desired),
  and salt and pepper to taste. Place in a 9x12" oven-to-table dish.
  
  5. Remove the salmon from the marinade and place on top of the leeks,
  skin-side down. Bake until cooked through, about 15 minutes, or until
  the salmon flakes easily when tested with a fork. Serve immediately,
  sprinkled with chives and garnished with lime halves.

      4 sm Whole red snappers, cleaned
           -(1 1/2 to 2 pounds each)
      4 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
           Coarse salt to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper

      2 bn Fresh thyme (large bunches)
      4    Lemons, halved crosswise,
           -for garnish
      1 c  Light and Hot Sauce
 
  These fish are easily cleaned by carefully cutting a 2" slit along the
  bottom, reaching in with your finger toward the gills and removing the
  innards. Serving them whole allows your guests to enjoy all the sweet
  tender meat.
  
  1. Prepare grill with hot coals or preheat the broiler.
  
  2. Rinse the fish inside and out, then pat dry. Brush the snapper
  inside and out with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place 3 or
  4 sprigs of thyme inside each fish. Close the openings with small
  metal skewers.
  
  3. Lightly oil the grill rack and place the fish on the rack, 4" from
  the heat source. Grill until cooked through, 4-6 minutes per side,
  turning once. Serve immediately on a decorative platter garnished
  with remaining thyme sprigs, the lemon halves and some fresh
  nasturnium flowers, if available. Serve the Light and Hot Sauce
  alongside.

      2 tb Dry white wine
  1 1/2 tb Finely minced garlic
    1/4 ts Paprika
        pn Dried red-pepper flakes
           Salt to taste

      2 tb Coarsely chopped flat-leaf
           -parsley
      3    Lemons, halved crosswise,
           -for garnish
 
  For best results, be careful not to overcook shrimp, because they will
  toughen. It's difficult when judging cooking time, because shrimp
  vary so greatly in size. For constant success, be sure to try one as
  they cook; you'll get the feel of it soon enough.
  
  1. Peel and devein shrimp, leaving the tails on. Rinse and pat dry.
  
  2. For marinade, combine the oil, wine, garlic, paprika, pepper
  flakes, salt, pepper and 1 tablespoon parsley in a large bowl. Add
  the shrimp and toss well. Refrigerate, covered, for 1 hour.
  
  3. Thread about 4-6 shrimp, crosswise, on each of 6 skewer. Grill 3"
  from high heat source, brushing with and remaining marinade. Cook 3-4
  minutes per side or until cooked through. (Do not overcook, or the
  shrimp will be tough.)
  
  4. Serve the skewer on a large platter, sprinkled with the remaining
  parsley, with lemon halves alongside.

      4    Pieces swordfish, cut 1"
           -thick (6-8 oz ea)
      4 tb Olive oil
           Salt to taste
           Pepper to taste

      1    Garlic clove, pressed
  1 1/2 tb Drained tiny capers
    1/2 ts Finely grated lemon zest
      1 tb Chopped parsley
 
  The greatest danger when cooking swordfish is drying it out. A light
  brush with oil is a nice way to retain moisture. Once the fish is out
  from the broiler, it will cook for a minute or two, so bear this in
  mind when testing it.
  
  1. Preheat the broiler. Brush the fish lightly on both sides with 1
  tablespoon olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
  
  2. Place the fish on a small wire rack set inside an ovenproof dish.
  Broil 4" from heat source for 4 minutes. Carefully turn the fish over
  and cook another 4 minutes.
  
  3. Meanwhile, combine the remaining oil, lemon juice, garlic, capers
  and lemon zest in a small saucepan. Place over low heat and cook,
  swirling the pan, for 2-3 minutes to heat through. Stir in the
  parsley. Place the swordfish on dinner plates and spoon the sauce on
  top. Serve immediately.

      Title: Hot Corned Beef Sandwich
 Categories: Sandwich, Meats
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 md Idaho potatoes
      2 tb Snipped fresh chives
      2 tb Chopped flat-leaf parsley
           Coarse salt to taste
           Coarsely ground black pepper
           -to taste
      2 tb Vegetable oil for frying (or
           -more if necessary)
    1/4 lb Lean corned beef, sliced
    1/4 c  Prepared coleslaw
 
  When grating the potatoes, don't be concerned with the starchy liquid
  that they give off. This will help bind them instead of using flour.
  If you don't have or don't like coleslaw, spread a small amount of
  mustard on the potato pancake instead, before adding the corned beef.
  
  1. Coarsely grate the potatoes into a bowl, working quickly to prevent
  discoloration. The potatoes should give off a starchy liquid. Add the
  chives, parsley, salt and pepper; mix well.
  
  2. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large, non-stick skillet over
  medium-high heat until hot. Prepare 8 potato pancakes: Add 2
  tablespoons of the potato mixture per pancake to the skillet,
  flattening the pancakes with the back of a spatula. Cook until the
  pancakes are golden brown, 2-3 minutes per side. Add extra oil to the
  pan, if necessary, and fry the remaining pancakes.
  
  3. Preheat oven on "low." Wrap the corned beef in aluminum foil and
  warm through in the oven about 10 minutes.
  
  4. Divide the corned beef evenly among 4 pancakes, topping each with 1
  tablespoon coleslaw. Cover with the remaining 4 pancakes. Serve
  immediately.

      1 ts Freshly snipped chives

           -cucumber, washed, ends
           -trimmed
      4 oz Thinly sliced smoked salmon
 
  It's essential for these "sandwiches" to be made on hothouse
  cucumbers, because they are practically seedless and make the best
  base, not being too moist. When buying smoked salmon, look for Nova,
  which is less salty than lox.
  
  1. Combine the cream cheese, chives, capers, lemon zest and pepper in
  a small bowl. Set aside.
  
  2. Cut the cucumber in half crosswise to make 2 pieces, each about 4"
  long. Thinly cut both pieces lengthwise to make 12 slices about 1/8"
  thick.
  
  3. Lay the cucumber slices on a paper towel and pat both sides dry.
  Spread each slice with about 1 teaspoon of the reserved cream-cheese
  mixture. Lay a slice of salmon to fit over each of 6 cucumber slices;
  cover with the remaining 6 cucumber slices, cream-cheese side down.

      Title: Media Noche (Midnight Sandwich)
 Categories: Sandwich, Caribbean, Meats
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2    Soft egg buns or egg dinner
           -rolls, halved
      1 tb Mayonnaise
      1 ts Prepared mustard
      2 sm Dill pickles, thinly sliced
           -lengthwise
      2 sl Swiss cheese
      4 oz Thinly sliced cooked pork
           -loin or roast pork
      4 oz Sliced boiled or baked ham
    1/2 ts Salted butter for brushing
 
  Midnights are made with soft egg buns, which are available in Spanish
  markets.  Midnights are made commercially in a sandwich grill, but
  the home cook will have excellent results using an oven.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.  Spread one half of each bun with
  mayonnaise, and the remaining halves or slices with mustard.
  Distribute the filling ingredients evenly between the
  mayonnaise-spread halves, starting with the pickle, followed by the
  cheese, pork, and ham, and top with mustard- spread halves, making 2
  sandwiches.
  
  Place the sandwiches on a lightly oiled baking sheet and brush the
  tops lightly with butter.  Place a heavy cast- iron skillet over both
  sandwiches to weigh them down and bake until crisp and hot, 15 to 20
  minutes. Makes 2 sandwiches. From: Earl Shelsby Date: 09-15-94

  For added texture, add the oats after the first knead or at the beep

  For additional crunch, sprinkle a few oats on top of the loaft after
  the final rise.
  
  Instant oatmeal doesn't work, but quick-cooking oats do.

  Rather than sweet, this loaf is a full-bodied squash bread,
  reminiscent of acorn squash.  The pumpkin seeds are a wonderful,
  distinctive touch; they give the bread crunch along with a special
  taste of autumn.

  If you're in the pioneering spirit, here's a sourdough for you.  Yes,
  sourdough IS possible in a bread machine - for bakers with the time,
  patience and adventursome spirit to see this most-independent bread to
  completion.  Because every starter is different, sourdough baking is
  always a challenge.  In bread machines, it becomes its own art form!
  Experiment - it's the hallmark of a sourdough baker!
  
                             Success Hints
                             -------------
  
  Follow preparation instructions for your chosen starter.  Starter may
  take 24 hours to 4 days to activate.  Always feed your starter equal
  parts flour and water (85 degrees).
  
  Use regular bake cycle.
  
  The more active the starter, the less you'll need.  Sourdough purists
  may omit the yeast listed above.
  
  Timing and temperature are the key elements of success.
  
       Careful observation will reveal your starter's peaking schedule.
       Starter should be peaking when loaded into the machine - frothy
  and
       bubbly, not just foamy.
  
       Optimum room temperature for culture activation and machine
  baking is
       85 degrees.
  
  If starter peaks at an inconvenient time, store it in the
  refrigerator. Reactivate by feeding again and placing in an 85-95
  degree place for 6-12 hours.
  
  Save some of the active starter for your next batch.  Refrigerate in
  an airtight container.

  ADAPT YOUR OWN RECIPEs
  
  REDUCE CHOLESTEROL:
  
  ~ Use vegetable oil or margarine instead of butter ~ Substitute 2 egg
  whites for 1 egg, or use egg substitute ~ Use more vegetables and
  grains and less meat in recipe ~ Use soy-based product to replace
  part of meat eg. tofu ~ Use nonfat milk products instead of whole milk
  
  REDUCE FAT CONTENT:
  
  ~ Use reduced calorie mayonnaise and salad dressing ~ Blend cottage
  cheese or yogurt with milk for sour cream topping ~ Replace regular
  whipping cream with low-cal topping or yogurt ~ Remove visible fat
  from meat and skin from poultry before cooking ~ Decrease oil in
  marinades and salad dressing; increase vinegar, water
    and seasonings
  
  ~ Use foods canned in their own juice or water ~ De-fat meat
  drippings by refrigerating and skimming fat off the top ~ Decrease
  the amount of fat used in baked goods by 1/3 to 1/2
    and increase flu
  
  ~ Cheese that is finely grated or thinly sliced goes further ~ Pour
  some of the fat off the top of "natural" peanut butters
  
  REDUCE SODIUM CONTENT:
  
  ~ Use low-salt or no-salt-added products ~ Increase your use of herbs
  and spices in place of salt in recipes ~ Use fresh foods whenever
  possible in place of canned or processed ~ Do not add salt to water
  when cooking pasta or other foods
  
  REDUCE SUGAR CONTENT:
  
  ~ Decrease the amount of sugar called for in traditional recipes
    by at least 1/3 ~ Use fruit canned in water or fruit juice ~ Use non

      Title: Dr. Rennard's Chicken Soup
 Categories: Soup/stew
      Yield: 16 cups
 
      1    Stewing chicken or "hen",
           -preferably whole (~4 lb)
      3 lg Peeled onions, halved
      1 lg Peeled sweet potato, halved
      3    Peeled parsnips, halved
      2    Peeled turnips, halved
     12 lg Peeled carrots, halved (2lb)
      6    Celery stalks, halved
      1 bn Parsley, trimmed of stems
           Salt to taste
           Fresh ground pepper to taste
 
  Put chicken in a very large pot and add water to cover. Bring to a
  boil and add the root vegetables. Simmer for 1 hour. Add the celery
  and parsley and simmer 90 minutes, or until the vegetables are very
  soft. Remove the chicken (reserving for another purpose). Drain the
  vegetables into a colander, saving all the broth. In a food
  processor, puree the vegetables. Return the puree to the broth. Skim
  off the fat before serving. (To make fat removal easy, chill the
  soup, skim, then reheat to serve.) Add matzoh balls if you like.
  
  NOTE: A stewing chicken, sometimes marked "hen," makes the best soup.
  It's often in the supermarket's frozen poultry section. If you can't
  find one, substitute a roasting chicken or, as a last resort, a fryer.
  
  NOTE: Leave the chicken whole and vegetables in large chunks to make
  them easier to separate after cooking.
  
  THE DOCTOR'S PRESCRIPTION: Freeze the soup in small containers and
  use it when a cold strikes.
  
  THE ACTUAL THERAPUTIC AGENT? Rennard suspects the ingredients, after
  prolonged cooking, interact to boost the cold-fighting effect.

      Title: Dr. Ziment's Garlic Chicken Soup
 Categories: Soup/stew
      Yield: 4 cups
 
      2 cn Low-sodium chicken broth (or
           -3 1/2 cups homemade broth)
      1    Garlic head, peeled (about
           -15 cloves)
      1 md Onion, quartered
  1 1/2 tb Minced parsley
  1 1/2 tb Minced cilantro
      1 ts Minced mint
      1 ts Minced basil leaves
      1 ts Curry powder
    1/4 ts Red pepper flakes
           Salt to taste
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
 
  Put all ingredients except the lemon juice in a saucepan and bring to
  a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered or uncovered, for 30 minutes.
  (Omit the cover if you wish to inhale teraputic cooking fumes.) In a
  blender or food processor, puree the cooked garlic, onions and herbs
  with a little liquid and stir back into the soup. Add lemon juice. If
  you want a clear broth, filter out the solid constituents. Makes
  about 3 1/2 cups.
  
  AN EFFECTIVE DOSE: As little as 1/2 cup, but for a better response,
  take 1-2 cups, Ziment says. He advises sipping slowly to get the most
  benefits.

  chop the garlic, dice the tomato, combine these with the avocado,
  chopped onion, cilantro and season to taste with salt and lime juice.

      2 lg Onions; diced
      2 ts ;Salt
      4    To 6 cloves garlic; minced
      2 ts Ground cumin
      8 c  Fresh or canned whole-kernel
           -- corn
      6    Poblano chiles; roasted,
           -- peeled, seeded & diced *
      1    Bunch chives; thinly sliced
           -- on diagonal for garnish
 
   * Roast chiles over a gas flame or on a tray under the broiler.  Keep
  turning so that the skin is evenly charred.  Transfer the charred
  peppers to a plastic bag, tie the top closed, and let steam until
  cool to the touch, about 15 minutes.  Pull off the charred skin by
  hand, then dip the peppers briefly in water to remove any blackened
  bits.
  
  1) Combine milk, cumin seeds, bay leaves, and rosemary in a medium
  saucepan.  Place over low heat and bring nearly to a simmer.  (Do not
  boil.)  Remove from heat and let sit 20 minutes.
  
  2) Heat olive oil in a large saucepan or stockpot over medium heat.
  Cook onions with salt until golden brown, stirring frequently, 15 to
  20 minutes. Add garlic and ground cumin and cook, stirring
  frequently, for 5 minutes; stir in corn and diced chiles; continue
  cooking over low heat 5 more minutes.
  
  3) Using a fine strainer, strain the infused milk into the corn and
  chile mixture.  Bring to a very slow simmer over low heat.  Simmer
  gently for 15 minutes.
  
  4) Pour one third of the soup into a food processor or blender and
  puree; stir back into soup pot.
  
  Serve hot in shallow soup bowls, sprinkled with chives.
  
  NOTES:  Corn and roasted poblanos are one of those sweet and spicy
  combinations that give Mexican cooking its lovely complexity.
  Poblanos' heat can vary widely according to season, so reduce the
  quantity if yours are from a hot crop.  They are not meant to
  overpower the delicate corn.

      Title: ROVERS REWARDS
 Categories: Pets
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    3/4 c  Hot water or meat juices
    1/2 c  Margarine
    1/2 c  Powdered milk
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Sugar
      1 ea Egg, beaten
      3 c  Whole wheat flour
 
  In a large bowl, pour hot water over margarine. Stir in powdered milk,
  salt, sugar and egg. Add flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after
  each addition. Knead 3 to 4 minutes, adding more flour if necessary
  to make a very stiff dough. Pat or roll to 1/2 inch thickness and cut
  out with a dog biscuit cutter. Place on a greased baking sheet and
  bake at 325 degrees for 50 minutes. Allow to cool and dry out till
  hard. I bake these on an ungreased 14 x 15 1/2 inch air bake pan
  which it *fills* using both large and small cookie cutters.  They can
  be placed side by side since there is no rising.  They slide right
  off onto an opened brown bag and cool and harden in no time.  I was
  advised in DOGHOUSE by a learned fellow that it might not be a bag
  idea to cut the sugar and salt quantities.  Gotta watch their health
  too!  Considering what's in the treats to be bought, these are
  considerably better for them.

      Title: All about Fudges
 Categories: Candies, Information
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Here are a few helpful
           -hints on fudgemaking.
           Always use a heavy pan.
 
  Be sure sugar is dissolved before candy boils.  Thus always start
  candy cooking over a low fire. Butter sides of pan to prevent candy
  from overflowing.  This also helps eliminate candy from becoming
  sugary. To prevent grainy candy, try adding a little vinegar to the
  other ingredients. You will find it will become much creamier. For
  smoother and creamier fudge, add a teaspoon of cornstarch to each cup
  of sugar. To avoid burning candy drop three or four marbles into pan.
  Boiling keeps marbles in constant motion; it does most of the
  stirring for you. (This idea was garnered from an old-time candy
  maker, and I  would not recommend it today. Many marbles are now made
  of plastic or other materials that cannot withstand high
  temperatures.) THE FUDGE DOCTOR Condition: Fudge doesn't get thick.
  It is undercooked; therefore, return to heat and recook. Condition:
  Fudge gets hard in pan.  It has been overcooked.  Add a few
  tablespoons of milk and recook over low heat and stir until softened.
  FUDGE VARIATIONS After fudge has been made and begins to thicken,
  stir in one or more of the following:  chopped walnuts, pecans, or
  peanuts, peanut butter, raisins or coconut. SOURCE: How to make Candy

      Title: Rosie's Cream of Broccoli Soup
 Categories: Soup/stew, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    3/4 c  Water
  1 1/2    Chicken bouillon cube
  4 1/2 c  Broccoli florets & peeled
           -stems
     36 oz Evaporated skim milk
           Vegetable oil cooking spray
      6    Leeks; chopped, white part
           -only
      3 tb Flour; all purpose
    3/4 ts Nutmeg; ground
  1 1/2    Garlic clove; minced
  4 1/2 tb Fresh basil; chopped
           Black pepper; freshly ground
           --to taste
 
  Because I use low-fat evaporated skim milk instead of heavy cream,
  this velvety soup has only 1-1/2 grams of fat per serving.  Adding
  the bouillon cube to the water in which the broccoli cooks lends
  added richness; if you're on a limited salt diet, use a
  reduced-sodium bouillon cube.
  
  Bring the water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
  Dissolve the bouillon cube in the boiling water.  Add the broccoli
  and cook for 5-6 minutes, until it is bright green and fork tender.
  
  Put the evaporated milk in a small saucepan.  Warm over low heat, just
  until bubbles begin to form around the edge.  Remove the pan from the
  heat.
  
  Preheat a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat for about 1 minute.
  Spray it twice with the vegetable oil.  Add the leeks and saute,
  stirring often, for 7-8 minutes, until limp.  Stir in the flour and
  cook for 1 minute. Whisk in the warm evaporated milk.  Continue to
  cook, whisking constatnly, until the flour has dissolved and the
  mixture is smooth.
  
  Reduce the heat to low. Add the nutmeg, the garlic, and the broccoli,
  along with its cooking liquid. Simmer for 5 minutes more, taking care
  not to bring the soup to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat and
  stir in the basil and black pepper.

      Title: About Japanese Cuisine (Part 2)
 Categories: Information, Japanese
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           No Ingredients Found
 
  Nearly as ubiquitous as rice in the Japanese diet, but offering a
  greater variety are noodles. The most common type of noodles are
  brown noodles made from buckwheat flour, called sobais a round,
  firm-textured noodle often served cold with dipping sauce or in a
  bowl of hot broth. Another popular type of noodle is udon are thick,
  white, wheat noodles, usually served in hot broth with other
  ingredients. In the spring and summer, somen noodles are very
  popular. A thin noodle made from a wheat dough to which sesame oil
  has been added, somen noodles are available in a variety of colored
  flavors. The noodles are usually cooked, and then served cold with a
  dipping sauce and condiments.
  
  Soybean products are another staple in Japanese cuisine. Soy sauce,
  for example, is used as commonly as salt is in Western cooking. It
  would be difficult to cook a Japanese meal without it. Equally
  essential to the Japanese cook's store of ingredients is fermented
  soba soybean paste, called miso. Miso resembles peanut butter in
  itsconsistency and is made in a variety of colors and textures, each
  with its own distinctive aroma and flavor. High in protein and B
  vitamins, miso comes in three basic categories: rice miso, soybean
  miso, and barley miso. Another important soy product, and one gaining
  ever-increasing presence on Western menus, is tofu. Also known as
  bean curd, tofu is a white, custard-like food made from soymilk
  processed from soybeans. Tofu is extolled by nutritionists and
  vegetarians alike as an excellent meatless source of protein. Western
  dishes tend to be categorized by the main ingredients. For example, a
  common Western cookbook is divided into sections such as Meats and
  Poultry; Vegetables; Pasta, Rice, and Grains, etc. Japanese food, on
  the other hand, is categorized by the method of preparation. When
  planning a meal, the Western chef will strive fora salad, a main
  dish, and side dishes that go well together and satisfy the four
  basic food groups. A chef of Japanese cuisine seeksa variety of
  dishes from the different cooking categories. One of the most common
  of these styles of cooking is called nimono. miso. This category
  includes dishes made by gently boiling or simmering ingredients such
  as vegetables, fish, or meat in a seasoned broth. Yakimonois, quite
  simply, food that is prepared by broiling, usually over a charcoal
  fire. Tempura, food deep-fried in batter, belongs to the group of
  agemono, or fried things. It is one of the most common Japanese foods
  in North America. The nabemono category consists of hearty dishes
  that are cooked in a large pot, usually right at the table. Nabemono
  contains meat, fish, vegetables, tofu,and perhaps some noodles.
  Sukiyaki, also very popular in the West,belongs to the nabemono
  group. Tsukemono, also known as Japanese pickles, are pickled
  vegetables that can be found with most Japanese meals. Ohitashi are
  boiled green vegetables served with soy sauce and topped with sesame
  seeds or katsuobushi (dried bonito fish shavings). Aemono, made up of
  cooked vegetables and seafood, are served cold and tossed with
  various sauces. As you can see, Japanese food comes in a wide variety
  of styles. Upon sitting down to a traditional Japanese meal, however,
  one is likely to find the utensils and serving vessels as numerous
  and varied as the dishes themselves. The cook seeks to serve his or
  her creations in well-designed vessels that make an appropriate
  background for their colors and textures. The goal is to achieve
  harmony between the color of the food and that of the dish in which
  it is served. Serving the food, like cooking it, is considered an
  art. It has also been said that, as a rule, round foods should be
  served in square vessels, and square shaped foods should be served in
  round vessels. Perhaps no other country uses such a wide variety of
  tableware as Japan. Japanese cuisine is one of the most healthiest
  and visually appealing foods in the world. Today, modern science is
  shedding new light on the nutritional and healing value of Japanese
  traditional foods. With Keiko's quick and easy recipes you can surely
  add this exceptionally wholesome and tasty food to your daily
  repertoire of favorite dishes.

      Title: About Japanese Cuisine (Part 1)
 Categories: Information, Japanese
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           ABOUT JAPANESE CUISINE
           ======================
 
  Japan has come to be recognized the world over for its nearly
  unrivaled level of excellence in the production of high-tech gadgets
  and gizmos. The attention to quality and detail in their products is
  truly astounding. But this attention to detail, this dedication to
  quality, did not begin with the production of sophisticated
  automobiles and electronics. Indeed, as far back as one can look into
  the history of this remarkable island country, evidence is readily
  available that the Japanese have an acute eye for detail, and a love
  of beauty. Perhaps one of the most pleasurable aspects of Japanese
  culture to illustrate this point is their cuisine. Japanese food is
  at once both simple and complex. Ask any native to describe
  traditional Japanese food, and you will surely hear words like simple
  and subtle. Compared to Western cuisines and those of China, Korea,
  and other Asian countries, Japanese food is much moremild and
  natural, always containing the freshest ingredients available. This
  is due in part to the deep respect that the Japanese have for nature.
  They believe that the natural form and flavor of the ingredients
  should be preserved as much as possible. It is this innate wholesome
  quality that is drawing ever-increasing attention and popularity to
  this age-old cuisine. The complexity of Japanese food comes not in
  the actual making of each dish, but in the care that is taken both in
  the selection of the ingredients and in the serving of the finished
  product. In Japan, it is said that a truly fine meal will please not
  only the palate, but all of the senses: taste, sight, smell, and
  hearing as well. Even the texture of the food is taken into careful
  consideration. The cook selects the ingredients not only for the
  unique flavor of each, but also for the color that each will lend to
  the finished dish. Thus a total appreciation of the harmony of beauty
  and flavor may be achieved. Another consideration in the selection of
  ingredients is the time of year. As much as possible, Japanese cooks
  use fruits and vegetables that are in season at the time. Spring, for
  example, brings such wild plants as seri (watercress) and warabi
  (fern shoots) which can be readily obtained from woodlands and
  forests. With summer comes many garden vegetables such as lettuce,
  tomatoes, eggplants, peas, beans, and cucumbers. A wild mushroom
  harvest takes place in autumn when the pine forests abound with the
  large [1]matsutake. In the winter time, meals contain a number of
  root vegetables like carrots, turnips, and daikon, a large white
  radish. There are a number of ingredients, of course, that are
  available year round. Such fresh products of the sea as cod, tuna,
  sea bass, and yellowtail can be found on display at the fish markets
  any timeof the year. Other delicious items are octopus, sea urchin,
  and various kinds of edible seaweed. There are a number of foods that
  are considered staples in the Japanese diet, and these are eaten year
  round, as well. The first of these is, of course, rice. No Japanese
  meal would be complete without it. Rice plays such a central role in
  Japanese cuisine that the word for cooked rice, gohan, has come to
  mean food in the Japanese language. While a traditional Japanese meal
  has no matsutake designated main dish, rice is the most important
  food served. Side dishes are meant to complement the delicious taste
  of the cooked rice.

  square on baking sheet. Brush with melted butter. Place another
  square atop first square so that points face in different directions.
  Brush with melted butter. Place another square atop second square so
  that points face in different directions than points of first 2
  squares. Place about 3/4 C fruit mixture in center of phyllo. Brush
  edges of phyllo with melted butter. Gather corners of phyllo together
  to form parcel. Gently twist phyllo to enclose filling. Brush outside
  with butter. Repeat with remaining phyllo, butter and fruit, forming
  total of 4 parcels. Chill until butter has set, about 15 minutes.

  beating until stiff and glossy. Mix instant coffee powder and 1 t
  water in cup until dissolved. Mix into egg white mixture. Fold in

  Wrap in plastic; chill 1 hour. (Curd and dough can be pre- pared up
  to 2 days ahead. Keep refrigerated. Let dough soften briefly at room
  temperature before rolling.)
  
  Preheat oven to 450'F. Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to
  12- inch round. Transfer to large baking sheet. Sprinkle dough with 2
  T sugar. Place lemon pieces on dough, leaving 1 1/2-inch border.
  Sprinkle 2 T sugar over lemon pieces. Fold dough border in over lemon
  pieces; press edges lightly to seal. Bake until crust is golden,
  piercing through lemon pieces with toothpick if crust bubbles, about
  25 minutes. Cool tart completely. (Can be made 4 hours ahead.)
  
  FOR MERINGUE: Preheat oven to 450'F. Using electric mixer, beat egg
  whites in medium bowl until soft peaks form. Add sugar and beat until
  mixture is stiff but not dry.
  
  Spread lemon curd over lemon pieces in crust, covering completely.
  Spread meringue over, covering curd completely and sealing to crust
  edges. Bake until meringue is golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer tart
  to platter.

      Title: BASIC AREPA DOUGH
 Categories: Breads, So. america
      Yield: 1 serving
 
      2 c  Pre-cooked masa flour
           -(yellow or white)
      1 ts Salt
      3 c  ;water, boiling
           Butter; softened
 
  Arepas are simple corn cakes first made by the Indians of Colombia and
  Venezuela. They were an important part of their diet, like corn
  tortillas were to the Aztecs.
  
  Over the centuries, the poor people of Colombia and Venezuela
  continued to use them as inexpensive, easy-to-prepare source of
  nourishment. Today, these humble corn cakes are a comfort food for
  the rich and poor alike, a heart-warming tribute to simplicity,
  tradition, versatility, and good taste.
  
  Originally, arepas were made from dried corn kernels that were soaked
  overnight in water and lime to remove the skins, then cooked, drained
  and ground into masa (dough). Thanks to modern technology, a
  pre-cooked harina de masa is now available at most Latin American
  markets. An instant masa can be made by simply mixing this corn flour
  (either white or yellow) with a little salt and enough boiling water
  to make a stiff dough.
  
  The dough is then shaped into flat round cakes of varying thicknesses,
  depending on the intended use, and cooked on a griddle or deep-fried.
  In parts of Colombia, arepas are cooked atop a flagstone slab that is
  first heated and then brushed with fat. Another Colombian specialty
  ~- arepas de chocolo -- are made from fresh corn and cooked on top of
  banana leaves.
  
  Colombian arepas are generally thinner than their Venezuelan
  counterparts. The standard Venezuelan arepa looks somewhat like a
  flat bread roll, crispy on the outside and doughy on the inside. They
  can be split open and buttered, or spread with cream cheese or fresh
  goat cheese. Made this way, they are served for breakfast or as an
  accompaniment for grilled fowl, fish, meat stews, or sausages.
  
  In Venezuela, the doughy inside is sometimes scooped out, and the
  shell is filled with savory mixtures of ground or chopped pork, beef,
  ham, chicken, seafood, vegetables, or beans. They are excellent first
  courses. Venezuelan mandocas, for example, are cheese arepas shaped
  into rings and deep-fried. Another specialty is bollos pelones --
  balls of arepa dough stuffed with seasoned ground meat, either fried
  or poached in water, then served with tomato sauce.
  
  A popular snack in Colombia consists of arepas served with fresh
  cheese and fried chorizo (sausage). Colombians also make tasty soups
  using fresh masa or leftover arepas. Arepitas dulces make great
  desserts.
  
  The versatile arepa indeed proves that umpretentioius food can be not
  only satisfying but also delicious.
  
  Directions:
  
  In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Add water, stir with a
  wooden spoon to make a soft dough. Let stand for 5 minutes, then
  knead for 3 minutes. Dough is ready to be shaped into standard
  arepas, or to be mixed and kneaded with other ingredients such as
  cheese, chicharrones (pork rind), etc.
  
  Venezuelan arepa is 3 inches in diameter, 3/4 inch thick. Columbian
  arepas are larger and thinner, about 4 inches in diameter, 1/4 inch
  thick. To make arepas, oil or wet hands lightly and shape dough into
  balls. Place between 2 pieces of wax paper or plastic wrap and
  flatten into a circle; shape the edges to form a smooth disc.
  
  To cook arepas: Heat a griddle or cast iron skillet over medium heat;
  grease lightly and cook arepas on both sides, turning a couple of
  times until a crust is formed. Colombian arepas are ready to be
  served at this point, spread with butter. Venezuelan arepas have to
  be baked in a preheate 350-degree oven for 15 minutes. To check for
  doneness, tap the arepa lightly -- if a hollow sound is heard, it's
  ready. Split open, add butter and serve hot.
  
  Arepas freeze well if frozen while still warm. Freeze in layers
  separated by plastic wrap. Reheat frozen arepas wrapped in aluminum
  foil in a preheated 350-degree oven for 10 minutes or until heared
  through.

      1 tb Butter, unsalted
  1 1/4 c  Vanilla wafer crumbs
    1/4 c  Nuts; finely chopped
      3 tb Sugar, confectioners'

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
     24 oz Cream cheese; softened
      1 c  Sugar
      4 lg Egg; room temp
    1/4 c  Amaretto
      2 tb Cornstarch
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 c  Ghirardelli semi-sweet
           -chocolate chips

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
      2 c  Sour cream; room temp
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 ts Amaretto
    1/2 c  Almonds, toasted sliced
 
  Make the crust: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat
  to 375-F. Lightly butter the bottom and side of a 9 x 3" round
  springform pan. Trim a 9" cardboard cake circle so that it fits
  snugly within the curved lip of the bottom of the springform pan.
  Cover the top of the cardboard lined springform bottom with a piece
  of aluminum foil, leaving a 2" overhang all the way around the edge.
  Carefully attach the side of the springform so as not to tear the
  foil. Wrap the foil overhang halfway up the side of the springform
  pan. Lightly butter the foil covered bottom and side of the
  springform pan. In the top of a double boiler over hot, not
  simmering, water, melt the chocolate chips with the butter, stirring
  frequently, until smooth. Remove the top part of the double boiler
  from the bottom and cool the chocolate mixture until tepid. In a
  large bowl, stir together the crumbs, nuts and sugar until combined.
  Add the chocolate mixture and using a fork, stir together the
  chocolate and crumbs, until combined. Press the mixture evenly into
  the bottom of the prepared pan, making sure that the crust extends 1"
  up the side of the pan. Set aside.
  
  Make the filling: In a large bowl, using a hand held electric mixer
  set at medium high speed, beat the cream cheese with the sugar for 2
  to 3 minutes, or until smooth. One at a time, beat in the eggs,
  beating well after each addition. Beat in the liqueur, cornstarch and
  vanilla until smooth. Stir in the chocolate chips. Pour the
  cheesecake filling into the prepared pan and smooth the surface with
  a rubber spatula. Bake the cheesecake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until
  a knife comes out clean when inserted near the center. Cool for 5
  minutes. Do not turn off the oven.
  
  Make the topping: In a large bowl, stir together the sour cream,
  sugar and liqueur until combined and spread it evenly over the
  surface of the cake. Bake for 5 minutes longer. Cool the cheesecake
  completely on a wire rack. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate
  overnight. Remove the side of the pan and sprinkle the top with the
  almonds.

      Title: Cheryl's Blueberry Lemon Crisp
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 8 servings
 
  6 1/2 c  Blueberries
  1 1/2    To 4 teaspoons grated fresh
           Lemon peel, depending on how
           Tart you like it
           A few pinches flour
           TOPPING:
  1 1/2 c  Brown sugar
      1 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 c  Butter, softened
 
  Put the blueberries in a large but shallow baking dish.  You can vary
  the amount of blueberries by half a cup either way without making any
  difference; 6 1/2 cups is what I happened to have on hand.
  
  Lightly sprinkle a few pinches of flour over the blueberries to help
  absorb the berry juice.  You can omit the flour if you want; if you
  do, there will be more leftover berry juice in the bottom of the pan.
  
  Sprinkle the lemon peel over the berries.  The tartness of fresh
  lemon peel balances the sweetness of the berries and topping, so use
  the amount that suits your personal taste.  Then go change the name
  of the recipe and put your own name in; you've customized it, you
  deserve it! :)  Reduce the amount of lemon peel if you decide to cut
  back on the amount of topping.
  
  Mix together the remaining ingredients; it will be easier if the
  butter and brown sugar are nice and soft.  Sprinkle the mix on the
  berries.  Bake for 25 minutes at 275-degrees F.

      Title: Oven Dried Sun Dried Tomatoes
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Tomatoes (from 10 to 1000!)
           Salt (coarse is better)
           Vinegar
           Olive Oil
           Assorted herbs, optional
 
  Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Half or Quarter the tomatoes depending on
  size. Place them cut side up on baking sheets and salt them down. The
  salt is used mainly to expedite the drying process. Bake at 300 for
  four to eight hours--until 'maters are dried. Dip in vinegar, and
  pack in sterilized jars with Olive Oil. Add herbs if you wish
  (Oregano seems an obvious first choice, but others would be
  interesting). Refrigerate. Keeps for many many months. USES: In cold
  salads, tossed in pasta (hmmm...like a creme sauce with slivers of
  dried tomatoes...I'm getting hungry...), in omlettes, etc. etc.

      Title: Sun Dried Tomatoes
 Categories: Vegetables, Can/preserv
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Plum (Roma Tomatoes)
      1    Pinch Salt
 
  I do mine in the oven. It takes considerably more time, but is
  incredibly easy & sensible considering plum tomatoes are $.39/kb and
  dried are over $4/lb. Plum tomatoes (Roma), any quantity you desire.
  Cut lengthwise. Removing stems is optional.   Sprinkle with a pinch
  of salt, or less and arrange them on a flat cookie sheet, skin side
  down. Place in an oven with the temperature set as low as you can get
  it (100 F is perfect)> Preheating is not necessary and allow to dry
  for four hours. At the end of 4 hours, check them, sometimes the ones
  at the back of the oven will go faster than the front.  Turn the pan
  if necessary. The tomatoes should have shrunk to about 1/2 their
  thickness, but still have some moisture in the center. Gently prick
  them with a fork on the cut edge, not the skin. Continue to dry them
  until they have the consistency of a dried apricot, about 2-4 hours
  more. Just be careful that they don't get too dry or that the heat is
  too high. Hard tomatoes are not enjoyable, and too much heat will
  ruin the texture.  To store them, put them into a container that will
  breathe for short term, or store them in the 'fridge in olive oil for
  long term. They are especially good right out the oven on grilled
  hamburgers or chopped up inside hamburgers.

  One at a time, remove each husk and spread about 4 tablespoons of the
  corn mixture in the center of each husk.  Fold the husk around the
  corn mixture to make a square packet, and tie securely with kitchen
  string. Make sure that all edges are sealed, and that no batter can
  escape from the husk. When all of the husks are filled, place them in
  a large pot of salted water to cover, and simmer on low heat,
  covered, for about 1 hour. Serve in their husks, warm.  They can also
  be steamed.

 Categories: Soup/stew, Meats, Vegetables, So. america
      Yield: 8 servings

      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
      2 ts Sugar
      2 tb Chopped cilantro
      1 ea Bay leaf
    1/2 ts Oregano
    1/2 ts Thyme
      3 ea Aji chiles; stems removed,
           -crushed, or substitute
           -piquins
  1 1/2 lb Sweet potatoes; peeled and
           -cut into 1/2 inch cubes
      3 ea Ears corn; cleaned, and cut
           -into 1-1/2 inch rounds
      3 ea Fresh peaches; peeled,
           -pitted, and halved, or
           -substitute frozen, thawed
           -and drained
 
    Clean the outside of the pumpkin under running water.  Cut off the
  top of the pumpkin to make a lid, making the opening 6 to 8 inches in
  diameter, and clean out the inside.  Replace the lid and bake the
  pumpkin in a roasting pan at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes.
    Heat the olive oil in a large casserole dish and add the cubed
  meat, a little at a time, and brown the meat on all sides.  As the
  meat browns, remove it to an 8-quart heavy Dutch oven.  To the
  remaining oil in the casserole, add the onion, green pepper, and
  garlic and saute the mixture until the onion softens.  Add the
  sauteed mixture to the browned meat. Add the beef broth and bring
  this mixture to a boil.
    Add the tomatoes, salt, pepper, sugar, cilantro, bay leaf, oregano,
  thyme, and the crushed chile.  Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for
  1-1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
    Add the cubed sweet potatoes and cook, covered, for 15 minutes.
  Finally, add the corn and the peaches, and cook, covered, for an
  additional 10 minutes.
    Carefully ladle the beef mixture into the pumpkin shell, replace
  the lid, and bake the filled pumpkin on a large, shallow roasting pan
  at 325 degrees F for 45 minutes, checking to make sure the shell is
  not getting too soft.
    If you are a brave soul, you can remove the filled pumkin to a large
  platter.  Or, if you are normal, you can leave the filled pumpkin in
  the pan and decorate the pan with Indian corn and sprigs of dried,
  colored leaves.  As you serve the stew, scrape off parts of the
  inside of the pumpkin, too.

  The key word to remember when choosing a garnish is 'complimentary'.
  The garnish should compliment the food it is placed with, not only in
  color, but in texture, size and taste.  The garnish around a main
  dish should never mask or overpower the flavor of the food being
  presented. When carefully selected and well prepared, food will be
  attractive by virtue of its own natural goodness.  A cook who wants
  the meal to look as good as it tastes and taste as good as it looks
  will learn to think color, size, texture and shape when choosing the
  best garnish for adding a new dimension to the food and to the whole
  meal. Good food, well prepared, coupled with good design involving
  color, form and pleasing combinations all add up to a successfully
  garnished meal. Garnishes, as a rule, should not only be edible and
  attractive, they should also be tasty. As with most rules, there are
  exceptions; when using a garnish around a main dish such as a rib
  roast, leg of lamb, ham, etc., it is permissilbe to use uncooked
  vegetables such as beets and turnips. Fresh flowers and fresh leaves
  are also in good taste when they are used properly. Plastic leaves
  and flowers will do little if anything at all, to enhance the
  appearance of food, so it is a good rule to stay away from anything
  artificial when garnishing.

      Title: Garnishing Carrot Wheels
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           No Ingredients Found
 
  Carrot garnishes also offer an appealing color contrast to foods
  because the carrot is one of the few vegetables availabe throughout
  the year that gives us the orange color needed to contrast the green
  leafy salads and main dishes.  People who would not normally eat raw
  carrots will not hesitate to munch on a carrot garnish if it is
  presented in the right way.
  
  
  1.  The carrot cartwheels, when used in a salad or soup, add that
  little 'something' extra.  To make cartwheels, wash and cut off about
  1/2 inch of the carrot tip.
  
  2. Use the decorator tool and scrape the outside length of the carrot
  using a downward stroke only. This is known as scoring the vegetable.
  The downward scrape will creat small ridges all around the outside of
  the carrot. After scoring the vegetable, slice the carrot crosswise
  and you will get small carrot slices with a geared or cartwheel edge.
  Mix these slices into a tossed salad or use them in your favorite
  soup.

      Title: Garnishing Beet Asters
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           The beet aster is very easy
           -to make and adds another
           -variety of
           Vegetable flower for
           -creating centerpieces and
           -garnishes for a platter
           Of cold meat, relish tray
           -or mixed vegetable flower
           -centerpieces for
           Buffet spreads.
 
  1. To make the beet aster, selected a well-rounded, medium sized beet
  and cut off the top and root end of the vegetable to creat a flat
  surface.
  
  2. Peel the beet completely.
  
  3. With the knife, make a series of parallel cuts.  Start these cuts
  from the stem end and slice all the way to, but not through, the root
  end of the vegetable. Stop the cut about 1/4 inch from the root end.
  Cut the slices as close together as possible.
  
  4. When you have completed this series of cuts, give the beet a
  quarter turn and cut a second set of parallel cuts across the first
  cuts forming right angles.
  
  5. Chill the vegetable in ice water and when ready to use, gently
  spread the petals for form the aster.
  
  ** NOTE ** To make a mixed bouquet of asters, use white turnips and
  follow the same instructions for making the beet asters.  The turnip
  asters can be colored by placing a few drops of vegetable food
  coloring in the ice water to tint the flowers in a variety of colors.

      Title: Garnishing a Beet Carved Rose
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           No Ingredients Found
 
  The beet carved rose is the most elegant of the vegetable flower.
  This rose also takes the most practice because it is hand carved from
  the raw vegetable.  Before attemption to make the rose from the beet
  or turnip, you should practice carving this flower from a potato.
  The potato is much easier to work with and any mistakes can be turned
  into sliced or mashed potatoes and nothing will be wasted.
  
  1. To start the rose, select a well rounded beet and cut the
  vegetable in half.  Hold one of the halves in one hand and with the
  other hand, use the small knife and cut a petal just below the flat
  surface of the beet. Cut these petals as if you were going to peel
  the vegetable, cutting close to, but not all the way through the
  base.  Try to keep the petals as thin and rounded as possible.
  
  2. Place the point of the knife between any of the two petals you
  have cut around the outside of the beet and cut out a thin ring from
  the inside of the vegetable.
  
  3. Cut this ring in a continuous strip as you would do when peeling an
  apple.
  
  4. After you have completed the second step it is just a matter of
  repeating these two steps, working towards the center of the
  vegetable. After removing the first ring from inside the first row of
  petals, start cutting the second row of petals, cutting them the same
  way as the first row was made. Each row of petals should be cut so
  they alternate.  This is done by cutting the inside petal between the
  two outside petals of the row you just finished.
  
  5. You will notice, as the flower progresses, that the rings you have
  cut out will get smaller and smaller until you have reached the
  center, or core, of the vegetable.  The more rows of petals you can
  carve out, the more striking and life like the rose will look.  It is
  just a matter of practice before you can produce beautiful vegetable
  roses.  Once you have mastered the carved rose, you are only
  restricted by your imagination as to the many centerpieces and
  garnishes you can create with them. For an elegant centerpiece on a
  buffet table, carve these roses from both red beets and white turnips
  and arrange them on a background of fresh parsley or watercress to
  creat a beautiful bouquet or red and white roses.
  
  ** NOTE ** The carved beet roses can be made ahead (in the summer when
  beets are in season and not expensive) and frozen until needed.  To
  freeze the carved beet roses they must be placed in a container of
  water and completely submerged before freezing. To two tone or accent
  the turnip rose, cut of a thin slice of beet and brush it across the
  tips of the turnip flower. This will give the turnip rose a new look.

      Title: Canning Chutneys & Pickles
 Categories: Can/preserv, Information, Relishes
      Yield: 1 file
 
      1    Textfile
 
  Canning Chutneys and Pickles
  
  Here are some general guidelines for simple, high-acid canning.  For
  more detailed information, see the "Ball Blue Book Guide to Home
  Canning, Freezing & Dehydration" ($4.95 plus $1 shipping and handling
  from 1-800-859-2255, or at some stores where canning supplies are
  sold).
  
  ** Use Wide Mouth canning jars and bottles.  You can reuse the jars
  if they are not chipped, but the two-part metal lids must be new.
  
  ** Wash the jars on the hottest cycle in the dishwasher and keep them
  there (hot, on the Dry cycle) until you fill them.  Bring them out
  one at a time to fill.
  
  ** Wash the two-part metal lids in hot, soapy water.  They must be
  heated before canning.  Heat lids for at least 10 minutes in a small
  saucepan of simmering, not boiling, water.  Remove the lids as needed.
  
  ** Fill the hot jars with the chutney or pickles.  (If you do not
  have a wide-mouth funnel, use a small measuring cup with a lip.)
  Leave 1/4-inch of space at the top for expansion.  Wipe the jars
  clean. Place the metal lid on the jar then screw on the metal ring.
  Screw just until you get some resistance.
  
  ** Use a tall, large saucepan (or a stockpot) to process the jars
  after they are filled.  Place a small rack in the bottom.  (If you
  have a fold-up steamer rack, it does the job.)  Fill the pot 2/3 full
  with water and bring to a boil.  Using tongs or a jar lifter,
  carefully place the fruit-filled jars -- which should still be hot --
  in the boiling water. If necessary add boiling water from a kettle to
  ensure that the water covers the jars by 1 to 2 inches.  Cover with a
  lid and boil for 10 minutes.
  
  ** Turn off the heat and remove the lid.  Then, carefully lift out
  the jars and place them on a wooden board or towel to cool.  You will
  hear popping sounds as the lids seal.  The cooling process will take
  12 to 24 hours. Once cool, press each lid to ensure it has seated
  well. If a lid pops after the contents have cooled, place in the
  refrigerator and use within a couple of weeks.
  
  ** Chutneys and pickles are cooked.  But unlike traditional jams and
  preserves, they require no thermometers or exact measurements.  The
  sugar and vinegar also act as preservatives, so no special canning
  equipment is needed.

  aside a deep 9-inch glass pie plate and baking sheet.
  
  Pour the berries in a large bowl and toss with the lemon rind and
  juice. Combine the flour, sugar to taste, tapioca and salt in a small
  dish. Add to the berries and toss well.  Let stand for 20 minutes.
  
  Ease the bottom pie crust into the pan.  Pile berries in the pan,
  mounding them in the center (they will cook down as the pie bakes).
  Dot with butter. Center the top crust over the filling, fold in and
  crimp the edges. Cut air vents and place the pie on the baking sheet.
  
  Place the pie in the oven and decrease the heat to 400¯F.  Bake until
  the crust is deep brown and the berries are bubbling (about 1 hour).
  Remove from the oven and let cool about 2 hours.  (Yeah, right  ;+}

  the lima beans, and cook until they are tender but not mushy, 12 to
  15 minutes. Drain, plunge into cold water to stop the cooking, drain
  again and place in a large bowl.  (If using peas, cook only 2 to 3
  minutes, until bright green and tender.)
  
  4.  Meanwhile, season the lamb with salt and pepper to taste, thread
  onto skewers and grill over a hot fire 3 to 4 minutes on each side.
  (The lamb should still be pink inside.)  Remove from the heat, and
  slide off the skewers.
  
  5.  Add the lamb, arugula and tomato to the bowl containing the lima
  beans. Stir the dressing very well, add just enough to moisten the

  The Rest of the Story:
  
  The syllabub is a Tudor invention.  In its simplest form, a milkmaid
  in the cowshed would direct a stream of new, warm milk into a large
  bowl of spiced cider or ale.
  
  Left standing for a while, a light curd formed on top with a delicous
  whey underneath, a concoction then drunk.
  
  The stiffer, more solid version we eat today evolved using cream
  beaten with wine.  In recipes published after his death in 1669, Sir
  Kenelm Digby suggests 'a tiny sprig of rosemary or a little twist of
  lemon peel be stuck into each little glass'.
  
  Syllabub makes an excellent partner to soft summer fruits at this
  time of year.  Either sprinkle raspberries or sliced strawberries on
  top or try sieved unsweetened raspberries added to the white wine in
  place of lemon juice and pour it over ratafia biscuits.
  
  Two readers Meryl Ambler from Hereford & Worcester and Louise
  Graegorczyk from London, sent in the following "cheat's" recipe for a
  non-alcoholic Fake Syllabub.  As Mrs Ambler says: 'Somehow this
  recipe gives off a true syllabuby, slightly alcoholic flavor.  You
  find people will make suggestions -- "What is it? Kirsch? Sherry?"
  
  Beat 10 floz (300ml) double cream with 5 floz (150ml) single cream
  until stiff.  Fold in 4 Tbsp caster sugar, the juice of a lemon with
  the grated peel of a lemon and a grapefruit.  Fill tall, pretty glass
  dishes and put in the fridge.  Decorate with chopped nuts or a slice
  of lemon, twisted, and serve with shortbread biscuits.
  
  There are many variations: some recipes use sherry with brandy, others
  white wine.  The 'true' method requires a statutory overnight
  marinating of the lemon peel with the brandy, wine and juice, then
  straining before use. But it's much quicker to use grated lemon zest
  and skip the overnight marinating.
  
  But beware -- overzealous grating can lead to bitterness and wreck
  this pudding.  The best flavour lies in the top yellow coat of the
  lemon's skin: use the fine holes of a grater and avoid the bitter
  white pith.
  
  One of the joys of a syllabub is it's best made in advance and happily
  stands in a cool place -- not necessarily a fridge -- for a couple of
  days. Submitted By PAUL MACGREGOR   On   08-17-95

  This is a relatively mild salsa.  To turn up the heat, add more
  jalapenos or some cumin.  Tomatillos can be omitted, but the salsa

  1 1/2 c  Granulated sgar; divided
    3/4 c  Vegetable shortening; melted
      2 c  Flour; all-purpose
    1/4 c  Molasses
      1    Egg; slightly beaten
      2 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Ground cloves
    1/2 ts Ground ginger
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  In a large bowl, combine 1 cup of the sugar with the melted
  shortening, flour, molasses, egg, baking soda, cloves, ginger,
  cinnamon and salt. Mix until well combined.
  
  Although you can form cookies at this point, the dough will be easier
  to handle if you cover and chill it for about 30 minutes.  Preheat
  the oven to 375¯F; lightly grease a cookie sheet.
  
  Using your hands, form balls of dough about the size of a walnut.
  Place the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar in a large shallow dish.  Roll
  the balls in the sugar to coat completely.  Place on the prepared
  cookie sheet, about 2 1/2 inches apart.
  
  Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until the cookies spread and are lightly
  browned on the bottom.  Cool the cookies on a wire rack.  Store in an
  airtight container.
