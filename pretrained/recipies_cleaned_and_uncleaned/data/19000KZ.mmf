 Categories: Pasta/rice, Italian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Rice (Vialone)
    200 g  Milanese pumpkin; cleaned
    100 g  Butter
           Parmesan
    1/2    Onion
      1    Stock cube
           Salt
 
  Time required: 30 min ca.
  
  1) Boil 1 litre water. 2) Fry the chopped onion in half the butter.
  3) Pour in the rice and the cubed pumpkin; roast slightly then pour
  in the boiling water a bit at a time. 4) Half-way through the
  cooking, add the crumbled stock cube. 5) Add cheese and butter before
  serving.
  
  Notes: This recipe needs dry pumpkin (milanese pumpkin in Italian): I
  don't know what it's called in English, but it has a dark knobbly
  skin and a dark orange dry, firm flesh. Neapolitan pumpkin is too
  watery.

 Categories: Italian, Rice, Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Juice of 1/2 lemon
      1    Celery stalk, chopped
    1/2    Carrot, chopped
    1/2    Head fennel, chopped

           -green onion) finely chopped
      9 oz Vialone Nano rice-see recipe
      2 tb White wine
      2 tb Chopped chives
           Typed by Manny Rothstein
 
  (Another recipe from Del Pescatore, along the banks of the Oglio
  River and in the small village of Runate, Italy. This is one of the
  house specialties, risotto made with wild onions and catfish.)MR
  
    Antonio Santini is adamant about using Vialone Nano rice for this
  dish, but arborito will work almost as well. If you can find those
  little onions that look like scallions but have very rounded bulbs
  (cipollotti), use those for a more assertive onion flavor and cut the
  final amount of chives in half.
    In pot bring 4 cups water to boil with lemon, celery, carrot and
  fennel. Reduce to simmer and add catfish. Cook at bare simmer until
  just flaking, about 6 to 10 minutes. Remove fish from poaching
  liquid. Reserve poaching liquid, adding enough fish stock or water to
  make 5 cups. Keep at boil for cooking risotto.
    While fish is poaching, melt 2 tb butter over med. heat in skillet.
  Add onion and cook slowly, stirring, until onion is very tender. When
  onion is tender, add fish and cook several minutes more. Season to
  taste with salt and pepper. Let cool. When fish is cool, chop coarsly.
    In separate saute pan, cook wild onion in 1 tb butter over med.
  heat with dash salt and 2 tb water. When water evaporates, add rice
  and cook cook several minutes, until rice makes a dry "singing" sound
  when stirred. Add 1 cup boiling stock and cook, stirring until almost
  all stock is absorbed by rice. Repeat, 1 cup at time, until rice is
  creamy and still bit chalky to bite, about 15 minutes. Add fish, wine
  and chives and cook another 2 to 3 minutes. When rice is cooked al
  dente, add remaining butter and stir vigorously so mixture becomes
  creamier. Rice should have a slightly soupy consistancy. Makes 4
  servings.

      Title: RISOTTO DI ZUCCA
 Categories: Rice, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 c  Onions, yellow; sliced
      1 md Kabocha squash; cubed*
  1 1/2 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Butter
      1    Clove garlic; chopped
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Sage, dried
      5 c  Vegetable broth
  1 1/2 c  Arborio rice
    1/4 c  Marsala wine
    3/4 c  White wine
      1 tb Balsamic vinegar
           Fresh ground black pepper
    1/4 c  Parmesan cheese; grated
 
  * 2 1/4 pounds, or about 3-4 cups cubed. If kabocha squash is
  unavailable, you can use buttercup squash, one of the hubbards, or a
  couple of acorn squashes. Avoid the blander varieties such as
  butternut and banana squashes -- you want rich, sweet flavor for this.
  
  Peel the onions and cut them in quarters, then slice them crosswise.
  Peel the Kabocha squash, cutting away any dark-green parts, seed it,
  and cut the firm yellow flesh into 1/2-inch cubes.
  
  Heat the oil and butter in a large, preferably non-stick saute pan.
  Add the onions and chopped garlic and stir over high heat for 3-4
  minutes, then add the cubed squash, salt, and sage. Continue cooking
  on medium-high heat, stirring often, until the vegetables are spotted
  with golden brown and the squash is becoming tender -- about 15
  minutes. Meanwhile, heat the vegetable broth to a simmer.
  
  Add the rice to the squash mixture and stir constantly for 2 minutes.
  Add the Marsala, stir quickly as it cooks away, then add the white
  wine.
  
  When the wine has all been absorbed, add about a cup of the hot broth,
  along with the balsamic vinegar. Lower the heat to a simmer and stir
  the risotto gently with a wooden spoon. As the broth is absorbed, add
  another ladle, and then another, always keeping the rice moist, and
  stirring constantly or at least very often. Some of the squash will
  fall apart into a puree.
  
  Use as much broth as you need to achieve rice that is al dente,
  tender but firm, with a creamy sauce around it. It will take about 30
  minutes, but start tasting after 20 minutes.
  
  At that point, correct the seasoning with a touch more salt and some
  pepper if needed, and stir in about 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan
  cheese. Add another 1/2 ladle of broth, stir well, and serve at once
  in warmed, shallow bowls. Garnish each serving with slivers of fresh
  basil, and pass more Parmesan cheese separately.

 Categories: Italian, Rice
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      3 c  Chicken stock; more if
           -needed
      2 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Arborio rice, about 2 cups
    1/4 lb Sweet Italian sausage;
           -skinned, crumbled
      1    Garlic; chopped
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
           Salt to taste
        pn Cayenne pepper
    1/4 lb Broccoli raab; drained,
           -squeezed, and
           Cont'd; coarsely chopped
           Black pepper; freshly ground
      2 tb Parmigiano-reggiano; freshly
           - grated
 
  Bring the stock to a boil; lower the heat to a simmer.  In a large,
  heavy gauge saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter.  Stir in the
  rice, toasting just until it starts to sizzle and pop, about 1
  minute.  It should not color.  Add the sausage and garlic.  Stir,
  breaking up the meat into small bits, until the sausage has lost its
  pink color, about 1 minute.
  
  Pour in the wine.  Stir occasionally, cooking until the liquid is
  almost gone, about 2 minutes.  Add just enough hot stock to cover the
  rice. Lower the heat to maintain a vigorous simmer; stir
  occasionally.  When the liquid is almost gone, add just enough hot
  stock to cover the rice, along with a pinch of salt and cayenne.
  Check the risotto every 3 or 4 minutes, giving it an additional stir
  to make sure it isn't sticking to the bottom of the pan and adding
  just enough stock to cover the rice when the liquid has almost
  disappeared.  After  a couple of additions of stock, add the broccoli
  raab.  Continue adding stock and checking until the rice is just al
  dente, about 20 minutes total cooking time.  Bite into a grain; you
  should see a small white pin-dot in the center.  Take the risotto off
  the heat and stir vigorously for a few seconds.  Fold in the pepper,
  cheese, and a pinch of salt if needed.  Stir in a few tablespoons of
  stock to loosen the risotto, if you like.  serve immediately.

  boiling, stirring constantly.  As soon as the stock has been
  absorbed, add another 1/2 cup of stock and stir.  The risotto must
  keep boiling, but it must not stick to the pot.  The whole cooking
  process may take 25-30 minutes. Once all the stock has been absorbed,
  and the risotto is tender, remove the pan from the heat and quickly
  stir in the butter and parmesan.

  RISOTTO WITH WHITE TRUFFLES:
    Prepare the Basic Risotta, omitting the garlic and cooking the
  onion in 3 Tbsp butter.  Use short grain California pearl rice amd 3
  cups chicken broth, adding to it the juice drained from 1 can (1 oz.)
  white truffles. When rice is almost tender, stir in 1/2 cup whipping

  butter, 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, amd about half the truffles.
  Pour into a serving dish and top with the balance of the truffles and
  sprinkle with about 1/4 cup more of cheese.
  
  RISOTTO ALLA MILANESE: Soak 5 large slices dried Italian mushrooms in
  hot water about 1 hour, rinse, drain, chop, and add to saute with
  onions in the Basic Risotto recipe. (or use about 4 medium-sized
  fresh mushrooms, chopped.)
    Use chicken broth for the liquid.  About 5 to 10 minutes before the
  rice is done, stir in with a fork 1/4 teaspoon saffrron, disolved in
  1/4 cup Madeira, white wine, or chicken broth. (the Madeira makes an
  outstanding dish.)
  
  RISSOTO VERDE:
  
  Use the Basic Risotto recipe, except substitute 3 slices green onion.
  While the rice is simmering, prepare this mixture; place 2 Tbsp
  butter or margarine in a frying pan over medium heat. Add 1 carrot,
  shredded, and one stalk celery, thinly sliced; cover and cook about 5
  minutes. Add 2 cups finely chopped fresh spinach or Swiss chard and 2
  Tbsp minced parsley, continue to cook, stirring several times, about
  3 minutes; sprinkle with a dash of nutmeg and add vegetables to rice
  when it is about three-quarters done. Finish as for Basic Risotto,
  omitting the final
        1    Tbsp butter.
  
  RISOTTO ALLA FINANZIERA:
  
  Prepare the Basic Risotto, using chicken broth.  While it is
  simmering, prepare this sauce:  Heat 2 Tbsp butter in a frying pan.
  Add 1 medium- sized onion, chopped, saute until onion is golden. Add
  1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms, 1/2 pound chicken livers (cut in bite
  sized pieces), 1/8 tsp EACH ground sage and crushed bay leaf, and 1/2
  tsp salt, continue to saute over medium heat about 5 minutes.  Add
  1/4 cup DRY Sherry or chicken broth; cook quickly until almost all
  liquid has been evaporated.
    Stir half the sauce into risotto with the first addition of cheese,
  omitting the 1 Tbsp butter.  Turn out onto a serving dish, making a
  well in the centre of the risotto, add the remaining sauce to the
  well, then sprinkle with the remaining cheese.

      Title: RISOTTO WITH MINT
 Categories: Italian, Rice
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 c  Chicken stock
      5 tb Unsalted butter
      1    Onion; finely chopped
      2 c  Arborio rice
      1 c  Dry white wine
    1/3 c  Fresh mint leaves; loosely
           -packed
      1 c  Parmigiano; freshly grated
           Salt; to taste
 
  Recipe by: Modern Italian Cooking Heat stock in a medium-size
  saucepan and keep warm over very low heat.
  
  Melt 4 Tablespoons of the butter in a large saucepan. When the butter
  foams, add the onion.  Saute over medium heat until the onion is pale
  yellow.  Add the rice. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or just enough to
  coat the rice with the butter and onion.  Stir in the wine. Cook,
  stirring constantly, until the wine has evaporated. Add a few laddles
  of broth, just enough to barely cover the rice. Cook over medium
  heat, until the broth has been absorbed.  Continue cooking and
  stirring the rice in this manner, adding the broth a bit at a time,
  until the rice is done, 15 to 20 minutes. During the last 2 or 3
  minutes of cooking, chop the mint very fine and add to the rice with
  the remaining tablespoon of butter and 1/3 cup of the parmigiano.
  Taste for seasoning and doneness.  The rice should be tender but
  still firm to the bite.  At this point, the rice should have a
  creamy, moist consistancy. Serve immediately with the remaining
  parmigiano.

      Title: RISOTTO WITH MUSHROOMS & ASPARAGUS
 Categories: Wasnone
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Mushrooms -- assorment
      1 lb Asparagus
      1 sm Onion -- chopped very fine
      1 lb Arborio rice
           Olive oil and butter
      1 qt Chicken stock
      1 qt Red wine -- see options
    1/2 c  Parmesan cheese
           Salt and pepper
 
  Assorted mushrooms: crimini, shitake, oyster; or combination of
  standard white, dried morel or porcini soaked in warm water one hour.
  OPTIONS: Need 2 quarts of liquid to cook the risotto. Half should be
  chicken stock but the rest can be either wine, mushroom liquid, or
  vegetable stock; or some combination. For a red wine, try Barbera
  D'Alba.
  
  Saute mushrooms in a little olive oil and butter and set aside. Blanch
  asparagus by a quick dip in boiling water until they turn bright
  green. Then plunge them in a bowl of ice water (not tap water). Chop
  off the tips and three or four inches os stalk. Save the rest for
  soup. With a low flame under the heaviest saucepan or saute pan you
  have: saute onion in a butter/oil combo until clear. Add rice and
  coat the grains with the oil. After a couple of minutes start adding
  liquid a little at a time, just enough to cover the rice. Stir often
  with a wooden spoon. Alternate chicken stock and the wine or other
  liquid. Continue adding the liquids a little at a time. The rice is
  done when it is still firm at the very middle of the grain but not
  crunchy to taste. This takes about 25 minutes. When it reaches this
  stage, add the mushrooms, a tablespoon of butter, the cheese, the
  salt and pepper, and thee sections of asparagus, saving the tips to
  decorate the tope of the dish.

 Categories: Appetizers, Italian, Rice
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 tb Lemon Peel -- julienne
      4 tb Unsalted Butter
    3/4 c  Onion -- finely chopped
      1    Garlic Clove -- bruised
      2 oz Paper-Thin Slices Of
           Prosciutto -- chopped *
      1 c  Arborio Rice -- (plus 2 Tbsp
    1/2 c  Dry White Wine
  3 1/2 c  Chicken Stock -- (about)
    1/2 c  Freshly Grated Parmesan
           Cheese
 
  Blanch lemon peel in small saucepan of boiling water 15 seconds.
  Drain. Repeat blanching process twice using fresh water each time.
  Alternatively, place peel in heat proof bowl. Pour boiling water over
  and let stand 15-20 seconds. Repeat as above.
  
  Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat.
  Add onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic
  and half the prosciutto and saute 2 minutes. Remove garlic and
  discard. Add rice and stir 1 minute. Add 1/2 cup wine and cook until
  evaporated, stirring constantly, about
        5    minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, bring the chicken stock to a simmer in a saucepan. Reduce
  heat to low. Cover and keep warm.
  
  Add 1/2 cup stock to rice, reduce heat and simmer until liquid is
  absorbed, stirring frequently. Continue adding remaining stock a half
  cup at a time in the same manner, allowing each addition to be
  completely absorbed before adding the next half cup. This should take
  about 25 minutes. Stop adding stock if the rice begins looking really
  mushy. It should be tender but still slightly firm to the bite.
  
  Remove from heat. Mix in remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, then the
  parmesan, lemon peel and remaining prosciutto. Garnish with paper-
  thin slices of lemon and/or a few julienne slices of prosciutto, if
  desired.
  
  *When I make this, I use close to 1/4 lb. of prosciutto because I
  *love* prosciutto and I also like to have a little left over for
  garnish as above.

      1 c  Dry white wine
           Water
      1 bn Dill
      1 sm Onion; finely diced
      1    Bay leaf
      1 qt Fish broth; -OR-
     16 oz -Bottled clam juice
      3 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      1 sm Onion; coarsely chopped
      3    Garlic cloves; minced
      2 c  Arborio rice
      4    Green onions; trimmed with
           -- about 4" green and cut
           -- in 1/2-inch lengths
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
           Lemon wedges (optional)
      1 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
           -- (optional)
 
  Shell and devein the shrimp, rinsing only if necessary. Reserve the
  shells to enhance the broth.
  
  Heat the other shellfish, once kind at a time, in the wine in a
  tightly covered pan.  Remove them as they open to a dish.
  
  Strain the shellfish liquor into a pot through a sieve lined with
  rinsed white paper toweling or tripled cheesecloth. Add the shrimp
  shells, about 2 cups of water, three or four dill sprigs, the
  coarsely chopped onion, bay leaf, and fish broth or clam juice.
  Simmer about 15 minutes, then strain and measure the broth. You
  should have at least 2 quarts; add wine or water if necessary to
  equal this amount. Add salt and pepper to taste. Heat the broth to
  just below a simmer and keep warm.
  
  Meanwhile, saute the shrimp in 1 tablespoon of olive oil for about
  1-1/2 minutes, or until just pink. Transfer the shrimp to the dish
  with the other shellfish.
  
  Place the remaining olive oil and butter in a large casserole that
  can be used on the stove, cover, and sweat the diced onion and garlic
  over medium-low heat. When the onion is softened, add the rice, stir
  well, and reduce the heat.  Saute the rice gently for about 10
  minutes, then stir in about 2 cups of broth.  Raise the heat again to
  medium-low. Continue stirring the risotto and adding more broth,
  about 1/2 cup at a time, as soon as the previous addition of liquid
  has been absorbed.
  
  Meanwhile, remove the leaves from five or six dill sprigs and chop
  them.
  
  The risotto will be creamy and the rice al dente when it is done, in
  16 to 20 minutes.  Two or three minutes before this point, stir in
  the bivalves, then the shrimp, chopped dill, and green onions if
  desired. When the dish is heated through, remove it from the heat and
  add salt and pepper. If the risotto is too thick, add more hot broth.
  Serve immediately. Pass lemon wedges and cheese if desired.

  1. To prepare the risotto: Bring a pan of water to the boil, add the
  tomatoes and time 1 minute.  Drain and rinse briefly with cold water.
  Peel, seed and coarsely chop.
  
  2. Heat the broth-water combination in a saucepan on low heat. Keep
  warm.
  
  3. In a large skillet or pot, preferably nonstick, heat the butter and
  olive oil over medium heat.  Add the onion and garlic; saute 5
  minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook 5 minutes, until softened and
  starting to break down. Stir in the rice, cooking for
        2    minutes.
  
  4. Slowly start to add the liquid, about a ladleful at a time. Cook
  over low heat, stirring frequently. Wait until the liquid has been
  absorbed each time before adding the next ladleful. The risotto
  should cook in about 35 minutes.  (The finished risotto should be
  creamy, with a little bite at the center of the rice.) Stir in the
  sun-dried pesto during the last 10 minutes of cooking time.  Stir in
  the salt and pepper.
  
  5. When the risotto is almost done, start the shrimp. Heat the olive
  oil over medium heat.  When hot, add the garlic and cook 30 seconds.
  Cook the shrimp until pink, curled and cooked through. Remove the
  shrimp with a slotted spoon to a plate.  Add the wine and boil until
  thickened to about 2 tablespoons.  Put the shrimp back into the pan,
  stirring to coat. Stir in the parsley, basil, salt and pepper.
  
  6. Spoon the shrimp over the risotto and serve.
  
  Note: The Cibo brand of sun-dried pesto used in this recipe can be

 Categories: Rice, Seafood
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      6    Plum tomatoes, cored
      4 c  Chicken broth combined with
           2 cups water
      2 tb Butter
      1 tb Olive oil
    1/2 md Onion, peeled and finely
           Chopped
      1 md Clove garlic, peeled and
           Minced
      2 c  Arborio rice
    1/4 c  Tomato pesto (see note)
    1/4 ts Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
           To taste
           SHRIMP:
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 md Clove garlic, peeled and
           Minced
    2/3 lb Medium shrimp, peeled and
           Deveined
    1/3 c  Dry white wine
    1/4 c  Chopped parley
     10    Basil leaves, slivered
    1/8 ts Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
           To taste
 
  1. To prepare the risotto: Bring a pan of water to the boil, add the
  tomatoes and time 1 minute.  Drain and rinse briefly with cold water.
  Peel, seed and coarsely chop. 2. Heat the broth-water combination in
  a saucepan on low heat.  Keep warm. 3. In a large skillet or pot,
  preferably nonstick, heat the butter and olive oil over medium heat.
  Add the onion and garlic; saute 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook
  5 minutes, until softened and starting to break down. Stir in the
  rice, cooking for 2 minutes. 4. Slowly start to add the liquid, about
  a ladleful at a time. Cook over low heat, stirring frequently.  Wait
  until the liquid has been absorbed each time before adding the next
  ladleful. The risotto should cook in about 35 minutes.  (The finished
  risotto should be creamy, with a little bite at the center of the
  rice.)  Stir in the sun-dried pesto during the last 10 minutes of
  cooking time. Stir in the salt and pepper. 5. When the risotto is
  almost done, start the shrimp.  Heat the olive oil over medium heat.
  When hot, add the garlic and cook 30 seconds. Cook the shrimp until
  pink, curled and cooked through.  Remove the shrimp with a slotted
  spoon to a plate.  Add the wine and boil until thickened to about 2
  tablespoons. Put the shrimp back into the pan, stirring to coat. Stir
  in the parsley, basil, salt and pepper. 6. Spoon the shrimp over the
  risotto and serve. Note: The Cibo brand of sun-dried pesto used in
  this recipe can be found in the refrigerator section of major
  supermarkets.

      Title: RISSOTO CAKES
 Categories: Rice, Cakes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     16    Servings
  4 1/2 c  Of chicken stock
      6 tb Unsalted butter
      1 md Onion, finely chopped
  1 1/2 c  Arborio rice
      1 c  Dry white wine
    1/2 c  Freshly grated parmesan
           -cheese
      1 lg Egg, lightly beaten
    1/2 c  All-Purpose flour
      2 tb Olive oil
 
  1. In a medium saucepan, bring the chicken stock to a simmer over
  moderate heat. Butter a 9 by 13 inch glass baking dish.
  
  2. Melt 4 tbsp of the butter in a large non-reactive saucepan. Add the
  onion and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until
  softened, about 5 minutes. Add the rice and stir until coated with
  butter, 1 to 2 minutes. Raise the heat to moderately high and pour in
  the wine. Cook, stirring, until almost all the wine is absorbed,
  about 4 minutes.
  
  3. Add about 1 cup of the simmering stock ( enough to just cover the
  rice ) and cook, stirring constantly, until the stock is absorbed.
  Continue adding stock, about 1 cup at a time; stir constantly until
  the stock is absorbed before adding more. The rice is done when it is
  just cooked through and lightly bound with with creamy liquid, after
  about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the Parmesan
  cheese. Let cool slightly, then stir in the egg. Spread the risotto
  evenly in the prepared baking dish. Cover and refrigerate until very
  firm, at least 4 hours or overnight.
  
  4. Cut the risotto into 16 even squares. Shape each square into a
  disk, about 2 1/2" in diameter and 1/2" thick. Coat the disks with
  flour and refrigerate on a baking sheet until firm, about 20 minutes.
  
  5. In a skillet, melt 1 tbsp of the butter in 1 tbsp of the olive
  oil. Add 8 of the cakes to the skillet and cook over moderately high
  heat, turning once, until browned and warmed through, about 3 minutes
  per side. Transfer the cakes to a warm serving platter, cover and
  keep warm in a low oven. Wipe out the pan and repeat with the
  remaining butter, oil, and risotto cakes. (The risotto cakes can be
  fried up to 1 day ahead. To serve, warm them in a 450 degree oven for
  about 10 minutes, or until heated through.)

      4    Trout; fresh or frozen,
           -about 1/2 lb ea, cleaned
           -but with head & tail left
           Salt
    1/2 c  Flour
      4 tb Butter
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 c  Sour cream
    1/2 ts Lemon juice
      1 tb Parsley; fresh chopped
 
  If you are using frozen trout, defrost them completely before
  cooking. Wash fish under cold running water, pat dry inside and out
  and sprinkle a little salt into the cavities. Spread the 1/2 cup
  flour over wax paper, roll the fish around in the flour and shake off
  any excess. In a heavy 10-12" skillet, heat 2 tb butter and 2 tb oil.
  When foam subsides, lower heat to moderate and fry the trout, 2 at a
  time, for about 5 minutes on each side, turning them carefully with a
  large spatula. When all the trout have been browned, keep them warm
  on a heatproof platter in a 200øF. oven while you quickly make the
  sauce. Pour off all the fat from the skillet and replace it with 2
  tablespoons fresh butter. Stir over low heat, scraping up the brown
  pan drippings with a wooden spoon. Add the sour cream and continue
  stirring for about 3 minutes without letting the cream boil. Stir in
  the lemon juice and pour the sauce over the hot fish. Garnish with
  chopped parsley and serve at once.

  ~- were inspired by a presentation Shirley attended at a cooking
  schools convention at the Ritz Carlton.  They are basically the same
  recipe Paula Murphy uses for candied peanuts; she uses raw, Spanish
  peanuts instead of almonds, and she doesn't coat them with chocolate.

      Title: RIVERSIDE KEDGEREE
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Cold cooked salmon or trout*
      1 lg Cucumber
      1 bn Watercress
    1/4 lb Shelled young peas
      8 oz Brown rice
      2 oz Butter
           A little caster sugar
           A little tarragon vinegar
 
  *Note: Salmon, sea trout or river trout may be used (farmed trout is
  unsuitable - its texture is too soft).
  
  Peel and seed the cucumber and cut the flesh into pieces no larger
  than matchsticks.  Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and caster
  sugar and 1 teaspoon tarragon vinegar. Toss lightly and set aside for
  at least 40 minutes, or all day if you prefer, to draw out some of
  the cucumber juices. Drain well and pat dry.
  
  Cook the rice in double its volume of boiling salted water or, better
  still, in fish stock.  It will take about 35 minutes to become tender.
  Towards the end of this time cook the vegetables. Boil the peas in a
  little lightly sugared water.  Melt the butter in a flameproof
  casserole, add the sticks of cucumber and cook over medium-low heat
  for 2 minutes, just stirring occasionally. Break the skinned and
  boned fish into big flaky chunks.  Lay the fish on top of the
  cucumber ~ don't stir it in. Cover the casserole and reduce heat as
  low as possible. Leave to cook, just shaking the casserole
  occasionally, until the cucumber is tender and the fish is well
  heated through - 4 minutes or so. Meanwhile put the watercress into a
  food-processor and reduce it to green flecks.
  
  To assemble the kedgeree, add the prepared watercress, peas and
  cooked rice to the buttery fish and cucumber mixture. Immediately
  draw the casserole away from the heat and season it generously with
  sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Toss the ingredients
  gently but thoroughly to mix them well and serve straight away with a
  large fresh green salad, or with a tomato salad if you prefer. Serves
  4-6.

      Title: ROADSIDE HARD CIDER
 Categories: Beverages
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ga Roadside apple juice
 
  For those of you in apple country it is time to start seeing roadside
  stands with those lovely gallon jugs of cloudy apple cider. If you do
  nothing it will start fermenting at room temperature so here is the
  first zero cost trick to keep it from exploding or becoming
  contaminated. Replace the cap with an unopened lunch sandwich bag so
  there are two layers covering the mouth.  Hold in place with a rubber
  band. Puncture both layers with a pin.  Move the plastic a little so
  the hole don't line up. Drink when the bubbling slows, 5-7 days.
      For kick -- add 1 to 1 1/2 cups of sugar (never two unless you
  like it sweet).
      For consistancy -- add half a pack of dry baker's yeast. ~----
      Fermenting time about the same for all three, decide by fewer
  bubbles, refrigerate to keep at some level of fermentation. ~----
      You can do a lot better than this but you need to get a book on
  making fruit wines.  But this is how to do it with things around the
  kitchen. Submitted By MGIWER@AOL.COM On MON, 30 OCT 1995 233351 -0500

 Categories: Meats, Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 lb Rib roast
      2 tb Oil

MMMMM---------------------YORKSHIRE PUDDING--------------------------
    3/4 c  Flour
    1/2 ts -Salt
    3/4 c  Milk
      1 tb Milk
      2    Eggs
 
  "It used to be the custom to cook Yorkshire Pudding and the Roast
  Beef in the same pan. Although it is rarely done today, Yorkshire
  Pudding still taste best if it is cooked in the fat that the meat has
  been cooked in, so that it absorbed with meat juices. Serve with
  Horseradish Sauce." Preheat the oven to 450F. Place the beef fat side
  up in the roasting pan and coat with oil. If you like your beef rare,
  it should cook for 1 1/4 hours and the meat thermometer should
  register between 130F and 140F. If you prefer it medium to well done,
  it should cook for 1 1/2 hours and a meat thermometer should register
  between 150F and 160F. Baste the meat frequently while it is cooking.
    Meanwhile, prepare the batter for the Yorkshire Pudding. Sift the
  flour and salt into a mixing bowl. Make a well in the centre and add
  milk and the water gradually, beating well after each addition with a
  wooden spoon.
    In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until fluffy. Add them to the
  flour mixture. Beat until bubbles rise to the surface. Pour the
  batter in a pitcher and refrigerate for 1/2 hour.
    When the meat is cooked, remove it from the pan and place it on a
  warm platter. Cover with aluminum foil and let it stand 25 minutes
  before carving.
    Reheat the batter and pour it quickly into the still hot cooking
  pan. Bake it in the oven for 10 minutes at 450F. Then reduce the heat
  to 350F and cook it an additional 15 minutes, until it is well risen
  and has turned a golden brown. (Do NOT open the oven door while it is
  cooking.) Serve immediately from the pan in which it has been cooked.

 Categories: Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Vegetable Oil
    1/2 c  Bourbon
      1 lg Onion; Thinly Sliced
      2 lg Cloves Garlic; Minced
      1 ts Freshly Ground Black Pepper
      1 ts Dry Mustard
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Wine Or Cider Vinegar
      1    Rib-Eye Or First Cut Chuck
           Or Boneless Round Steak;
           About 5 to 6 Pounds
 
  Combine the oil, bourbon, onion, garlic, pepper, mustard, salt and
  vinegar, blending well.  Place the meat in a plastic bag or glass
  dish. Pour the marinade over the meat and marinate 1 hour at room
  temperature, turning the meat 2 to 3 times.  Drain the meat,
  reserving the marinade. Spit the meat from end to end through the
  center or on a diagonal, making sure that the roast is balanced.  If
  the meat has not been tied already, tie it after you have fastened it
  in place with the spit forks--it will be a little firmer that way.
  Engage the spit and turn the meat, 8 to 10 inches above hot coals,
  for 1 1/2 hours or until a meat thermometer registers 120 degrees F.
  for rare, to  2 1/2 hours for well-done, 165 Degrees F on the meat
  thermometer.  Brush with the sauce for the last 30 minutes of
  cooking. To roast on the grill, place the meat over a drip pan with
  the hot coals surrounding the drip pan, or pushed back. Turn and
  baste the meat as needed to cook evenly.  Grill 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours.
  Let the meat stand, on a platter, 20 to 30 minutes before carving.
  Heat the sauce and serve with the meat.
  
  NOTE:
  
  Any leftovers make great sandwiches and beef salads.

 Categories: Beef, Clay pot
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      5 lb Rolled roast of beef
      1 ts Salt
           Pepper; to taste
      6 sm White onions; peeled
      6 md Carrots;peel/slice lengthwis
      6 sm New potatoes; unpeeled
      6 lg Mushrooms; sliced
      3 tb Parsley, fresh; chopped
      2    Bay leaves; whole
      1 ts Arrowroot; approximately
 
  "Roast beef steamed in the clay pot is a different experience. The
  meat has a delightful texture you can't find in beef cooked any other
  way. But one word of caution: it's going to take much less time to
  cook than you think. Rely strictly on your meat thermometer. The size
  of both the pot and roast will make a difference. If you like your
  beef rare, check the thermometer after 40 minutes. You can omit the
  vegetables if you don't want a complete dinner."
  
  Presoak your largest clay pot, top and bottom, in water fifteen
  minutes.
  
  Trim fat from beef and rub with salt and pepper. Place beef in pot and
  insert meat thermometer. Add to pot all above ingredients, plus 1
  teaspoon salt and dash of pepper.
  
  Place covered pot in cold oven. Set temperature to 480 degrees. For
  rare beef, check meat thermometer after 40 minutes. For medium beef,
  check after 1 hour. For well-done beef--if you really want it that
  way--check after 90 minutes.
  
  Remove pot from oven when meat thermometer is almost up to
  temperature. (Don't wait until it's right on the nose or it will be
  overdone.) Pour liquid into saucepan, bring to boil and thicken with
  about 1/2 teaspoon arrowroot.

  Meanwhile, skim the fat from the chili. Cut the meat from the bone
  and into thin slices. Layer it over the beans. If desired, stew,
  covered, to tenderize the meat.  Serve with hot rice and a sprinkling
  of scallions and sieved eggs.

      3 tb Butter
      2 tb Chopped onions
      2 tb Plain flour
    500 ml Beef stock
     50 ml Dry port or red wine
      2    Thick lemon slices with peel
      2    Bay leaves
           Salt and fresh-ground pepper
           Dash or two of wine vinegar
  1 1/4 lb Roast chicken (just the
           -meat, cut into bite-sized
           -pieces
 
  This recipe is perfect for those of us who get home dead tired,
  desperately tired but with no desire to actually *cook* anything. The
  gravy can be cooked ahead of time and refrigerated or frozen: or made
  on the spot, if you feel energetic.  The chicken you can roast
  yourself (again, if you feel like it) or pick up from the nearest
  place which roasts chickens and wraps them up for passersby (often
  using the kind of oven-with-rotating-spits which Peter refers to as
  "the chicken-torturing device"). Serve with mashed potatoes or
  noodles: or, if you have energy enough, dumplings.
  
  Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed non-reactive saucepan: add the
  chopped onions and cook until translucent. Add the flour, and cook
  until the *roux* is golden brown.  Pour in the beef stock and port.
  Add lemon slices, bay leaves, salt and pepper.  Allow the sauce to
  cook for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, then pour through a
  fine strainer, test for seasoning, and add vinegar and salt or pepper
  to taste. Add the chicken pieces and heat over a low flame.
  
  Re:  the gravy:  There's never enough of it.  If I were you, I'd
  double the recipe.  You can always freeze what you don't use.

      Title: ROAST CHICKEN WITH TARRAGON
 Categories: Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Main dish, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    3 to 4 lb. chicken
           -- with giblets
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
      6 oz Day-old French bread*
      1    Garlic clove; peeled
      4    Sprigs fresh tarragon
      1 c  Fresh tarragon leaves
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      2 tb Olive oil
 
  *Cut in 1 1/2 x 1 1/2 x 1/2" pieces.
  
  Rinse chicken well inside and out until the water runs clear. Pat it
  thoroughly dry.  Remove as much of the fat from the tail and neck
  area as possible. Sprinkle the cavity with salt and pepper.
  
  Rub the bread on all sides with garlic, and place two of these
  croutons, with the tarragon sprigs, inside the chicken.
  
  Carefully separate the skin from the breast meat of the chicken by
  running your fingers between the skin and the meat. Rub the meat with
  salt and pepper, and place 1/2 cup of the tarragon leaves under the
  skin, spreading them out so they cover the entire breast.
  
  Heat the butter and olive oil in a roasting pan over medium-high
  heat. Add the chicken, and brown it well on all sides, about 8
  minutes. Set the chicken breast side up, transfer the pan to the
  oven, and roast for
       30    minutes at 400 F.
  
  Add the remaining croutons, the neck and the giblets to the pan, and
  continue roasting chicken until it is evenly golden all over and the
  juices run clear, 12 to 15 minutes. Turn the croutons occasionally so
  they brown evenly.  Remove the chicken, croutons and giblets from the
  roasting pan and transfer them to a platter. Cover loosely with foil
  and keep warm in a low (200 F.) oven.
  
  Place the roasting pan, with the cooking juices in it, over
  medium-high heat.  When the juices are hot and bubbling, scrape the
  browned bits from the bottom of the pan, add the remaining 1/2 cup
  tarragon leaves and cook just until they are wilted, about 1 minute.
  (You need just enough cooking juices to wilt the tarragon. If there
  is no juice at all - which can happen - add 1/4 cup dry white wine to
  the roasting pan, bring it to a simmer, and deglaze the pan.  Add the
  tarragon and cook until wilted.) Taste for seasoning.
  
  To serve, cut the chicken into serving pieces and arrange them, with
  the croutons and giblets, on a warmed serving platter. Pour the sauce
  over the chicken and serve immediately.
  
  A rich, perfumed Fleurie, such as a Georges Duboeuf 1988 or 1989 goes
  well with this.

      Title: ROAST CHILIES
 Categories: Mexican, Peppers
      Yield: 3 Chilies
 
      3    Anaheim, poblano, jalapeno,
           -or serrano chilies
 
  Broiler method:  Set oven control to broil.  Arrange whole chilies
  with their top surfaces about 5 inches from the heat. (Some people
  cut a small slit in the shoulder of each chili to prevent it from
  bursting.) Broil, turning occasionally, until the skin is blistered
  and evenly browned (not burned).  Remove chilies to a plastic bag and
  close tightly; let chilies stand for 20 minutes, then peel.
  
  Anaheim and pablano chilies will roast in 12 to 17 minutes; jalapeno
  and serrano chilies, in about 5 minutes.
  
  Gas stove-top method:  Spear a whole chili on a long-handled metal
  fork, and hold it about 5 inches from the flame. Turn the chili so
  that it roasts evenly.  Place roasted chilies in a plastic bag and
  close tightly; let chilies stand for 20 minutes, then peel. The
  disadvantage of this method is, of course, that you can't roast a
  number of chilies at once.
  
  Roasting enhances the flavor of chilies and makes them easy to peel.
  Roasted chilies can be frozen before peeling, a convenience if you
  roast a big batch at once; wrap them airtight in plastic wrap.

      2    Duck Breasts
      2 md Onions
           Olive oil
     10 fl Milk
 
  Boil the potatoes in their skins until tender in plenty of salted
  water with two of the sprigs of sage. Preheat the oven to Gas Mark
  6/400F/200C.
  
  Heat a dry frying pan suitable for the oven (or a roasting tin) over
  a high heat until very hot. Place the duck breasts, fat side down, in
  the oven for two minutes until the fat starts to run. Season the top
  fat-less sides with salt and pepper. Continue to cook for 2 minutes
  and then transfer to the oven and roast for a further 10 minutes.
  Turn the oven off, open the door and leave the duck breasts on the
  edge to rest for 10 minutes.
  
  Peel and chop the onions as finely as possible. Saute in three
  tablespoons of olive oil for 10 minutes without browning. Meanwhile
  remove the sprigs of sage, discard and mash the potatoes. Add the
  potatoes to the onions along with the milk, beating all the time.
  When you reach a suitably runny consistency, season with salt and
  pepper and stir in a teaspoon of chopped sage leaves. Add more sage
  to taste and serve with the duck, cut into slices. I serve this with
  french beans but you could also use broccoli.

      5    Garlic cloves; slivered
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Freshly ground pepper
           Tabasco sauce
      1 c  Soy sauce
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      1 c  Port wine
      2 ts Thyme
      1 bn Watercress
 
  TO PREPARE THE FILLET, MAKE slits in it and put slivers of garlic in
  the slits. Rub well with salt, pepper and Tabasco. Combine the soy
  sauce, olive oil, port and herbs and place the fillet in this
  marinade in a baking dish for at least 1/2 hour unrefrigerated, or an
  hour or more in the refrigerator. Turn several times while it is
  marinating. Preheat oven to 425F. Place the fillet on a rack in a
  roasting pan. Roast for 30-to-35 minutes, basting occasionally with
  the marinade. A meat thermometer should register 120F for very rare,
  125F for rare, 130F for medium-rare. After it is removed from the
  oven, the internal temperature will rise as much as another 10F.
  Allow the fillet to rest, covered with foil, up to 30 minutes. If it
  needs to sit longer, you might try a catering trick: Wrap the fillet,
  just out of the oven, in plastic wrap. Unwrap just before slicing.
  Cut into slices and place on a warm platter; garnish with sprigs of
  watercress.

  Place one oven rack on lowest level and one rack on the next level
  above. Heat oven to 500 degrees F. Forty minutes before roasting the
  steak and mushrooms, use a fork to prick the potatoes once or twice
  each. Place them directly on the sides of the upper rack of the oven,
  allowing enough room for the mushrooms, which will cook on the same
  rack. Put the garlic in the blender or food processor with 4
  tablespoons of the oil. Blend until smooth.  Scrape down the sides
  with a rubber spatula. Add remaining oil and salt and pepper. Blend
  until smooth. Put the mushrooms in a 12-by-8-by-1 1/2-inch roasting
  pan. Using the spatula, scrape out half the garlic mixture into the
  pan. Rub the puree into both sides of each mushrooms cap. Allow to
  marinate for at least 30 minutes. Put steak in shallow container
  large enough to hold it. Pour remaining garlic mixture over and rub
  into both sides of steak. Let marinate on kitchen counter at least 30
  minutes or until meat comes to room temperature. Before roasting the
  steak and mushrooms, put a 14-by-12-by-2-inch roasting pan on the
  lower oven rack and preheat for 10 minutes. Remove pan. Immediately,
  put the steak with all of its marinade in the pan. Place on the lower
  rack, the thickest part of the steak to the rear of the oven. Place
  the mushrooms on the upper rack at the same time. For rare, roast the
  steak on one side for 6 minutes(for medium, 8 minutes). Turn the
  steak and ,ushrooms. Roast 6 minutes more. Remove steak, mushrooms
  and potatoes from the oven. Let steak rest about 5 minutes,  Slice
  thinly against the grain.

      Title: ROAST FRESH HAM~ TUDOR STYLE
 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Fresh ham or fresh pork
           -shoulder, whole or half,
           Bone in or boneless
      2 lg Onions, chopped
      2 lg Carrots, chopped
      2    Stalks celery, including
           -leaves, chopped
      3    Cloves garlic, chopped
      1 ts Brown caraway seeds
      1 ts Black caraway seeds (if not
           -available, use brown)
      1 ts Celery seed
      2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts Ground cloves, or 1 teaspoon
           -whole cloves
      1 tb Whole allspice, or 1
           -teaspoon ground allspice
      1 tb Grated orange zest
      1 tb Black peppercorns
      1 lg Bay leaf
           Salt, to taste (optional)
  1 1/2 c  Red table wine
    1/2 c  Red wine vinegar
    1/2 c  Olive oil
    1/2 c  Cognac (optional)
 
  Trim every bit of fat possible off the meat and discard. Place the
  meat in a large non-metal container.
  
  Mix all of the other ingredients together and pour over the meat.
  Marinate the meat in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or up to 8
  days. Turn the meat several times during marination so that no
  section is allowed to become dry.
  
  When ready to roast, transfer the meat to a large heavy roaster pan
  (an enameled iron roaster with a lid would be ideal). Remove the bay
  leaf, peppercorns, whole allspice and whole cloves (if used) from the
  marinade and pour the marinade over the meat.
  
  Roast the meat in a 350 F oven, basting frequently. Allow 30 to 40
  minutes per pound.  The inside temperature should be 165 F to 175F as
  measured with a meat thermometer. Remove the cover during the last
  1/2 hour. You should be able to "cut with a fork" when done. If the
  pan becomes too dry, add additional red wine and/or water, 1/2 cup at
  a time. You will want at least 1 cup of liquid remaining in the
  panwhen the roast is done.
  
  Transfer the roast to a carving platter and allow it to cool slightly
  before carving.  If desired, serve surrounded with small baked apples
  or spiced crab apples.
  
  HUNTER'S SAUCE:  Strain the liquid and vegetables from the roasting
  pan. Transfer the vegetables to a food processor or blender. Return
  the liquid to the roasting pan and skim off as much fat as possible.
  Add 1/2 cup of hot water to the pan and bring to a boil over high
  heat, scraping up the particles adhering to the pan. Reduce the
  liquid to 1 cup.
  
  Puree the vegetables in the food processor or blender. Add the reduced
  cooking liquid and blend until smooth. Transfer to a small saucepan
  and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. If the sauce is too thick,
  thin to the desired consistency with hot water.  Serve in a silver or
  pewter pitcher, bowl or sauceboat.

      Title: ROAST GINGER & GREEN ONION CRAB IN THE SHEL
 Categories: Seafood, Ceideburg
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1    Live Dungeness crab, about 2
           -to 3 pounds
      3 tb Peanut oil
      1 ts Salt
           Eight 1/2-inch knobs peeled
           -fresh ginger, bruised
      4    Garlic cloves, bruised
      8    Green onions, cut into
           -2-inch lengths
      1 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts White pepper
    1/4 c  Dry vermouth or sherry
      1 tb Dark soy sauce, or to taste
    1/4 c  Chicken stock
      1 ts Cornstarch mixed with 1
           -tablespoon water
      1 ts Asian sesame oil
 
  Although this popular crab dish It's often called 'roasted' or
  'baked', it is not. In restaurants, the cracked crab pieces are
  briefly deep-fried, then quickly stir-fried and finished in a hot
  wok. For the home cook, I have omitted the deep-frying step. Set up
  finger bowls and containers for discarded shells. Serve with hot rice
  and soup or salad.
  
  Hold crab under cold running water and scrub with a vegetable brush,
  paying special attention to the underside of the body and between the
  legs.
  
  To kill the crab, plunge it into a large stockpot of boiling water
  for 1 minute, or place the crab upside down in a large bowl and cover
  it with boiling water. When the air bubbles stop rising to the
  surface, drain the crab and let cool until you can handle it.
  
  If using cooked crab, omit this ,step and proceed to cleaning.
  
  To clean cooked crab: Place crab on its back. With a knife tip lift
  the apron or breastplate, the triangular-shaped flap on its
  underside. Grab it and the spine; pull backward, twist and remove.
  Grab the shell portion in one hand while gathering up all the legs
  and claws in the other hand. Rock the legs back and forth, tearing
  them away, from the shell. Pull off the feathery gills from both
  sides of the chest, remove the mouth and mandibles from its face and
  discard. Rinse crab with cold water. Blot dry. You may reserve the
  tomalley, the green spongy matter in the body, for another use,
  although state and federal authorities have advised against eating
  the tomalley in this season's crab.
  
  To crack crab: Bend and twist legs backward to remove. With a hammer
  or nutcracker, crack the shell in the middle of each joint and claws,
  and in the middle section on the edge side of each leg. Pat dry.
  Using a cleaver or chef's knife, chop the body through the
  midsection, dividing it into 2 halves, then each half crosswise into
  thirds.
  
  To "roast" crab: Preheat a wok over medium-high heat. Add oil, salt,
  ginger and garlic and half the green onions; saute gently to release
  the flavors. Using the backside of a spatula, crush the ingredients
  against the side of the wok to squeeze out juices about 30 seconds,
  or until fragrant.
  
  Increase heat to high. Add crab claws and legs; stir-fry for 1
  minute, or until shells turn bright orange, then toss in chest pieces
  and cook together for another 2 minutes. Season with the sugar and
  white pepper. While the wok is hot, splash the vermouth against
  sides, then the soy sauce. There should be a sizzle and hiss. Toss
  together for 10 seconds.
  
  Add chicken stock; toss to mix. Scatter remaining green onions over
  crab. Cover wok and "roast" or braise over high heat for 3 to 5
  minutes, or until crab turns bright orange. (If using cooked crab,
  braise for 1 minute, or until heated through). Shake wok occasionally
  to redistribute crab.
  
  Remove cover. Add cornstarch mixture in center of wok and stir until
  thickened (about 10 seconds). When the sauce glazes the crab, fold in
  sesame oil. Remove to a platter. If you prefer, discard ginger and
  garlic. Serve immediately with steamed rice.

      Title: ROAST GOOSE WITH POTATO PIEROGIES
 Categories: Goose
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1    Goose (about 10 pounds);
           -thawed
      7 ts Thyme, dried; divided
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Black pepper
      4 tb Oil; divided
     32 oz Pierogies, potato (2 pkgs)
      2 c  Onion; chopped
      2 tb Flour
      2 c  Chicken broth
 
  Preheat the oven to 400F.  Remove the neck and giblets; remove any
  large pieces of fat from inside the goose and neck cavity; reserve
  the neck and liver. Rinse the goose and pat dry with paper towels. In
  a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons thyme and the salt and pepper.
  Rub the bird with 2 tablespoons oil, then rub with the thyme mixture.
  Tuck the wings under and tie the legs together.  Place the goose,
  breast- side up, on a rack in a large roasting pan.  Pierce the skin
  all over with a 2-tined fork.
  
  Roast the goose for 1 hour. During roasting, pierce the skin several
  times with a fork.  To keep the fat from smoking, remove from the pan
  with a baster or dip out with a cooking spoon. Reduce the oven
  temperature to 325F. Roast for 2 to 2 1/2 hours longer, or until the
  internal temperature registers 180 to 185 on a meat thermometer, and
  the juices run clear when the bird is pierced with a knife. Continue
  to pierce the skin and remove the fat while roasting. While the goose
  is roasting, finely chop the neck meat and liver for making the
  gravy. Refrigerate until ready to use.
  
  When the goose is almost done, set a large pot of water to boil. Cook
  the pierogies according to the package directions. Meanwhile, in a
  large skillet, saute the onions in the remaining 2 tablespoons oil
  until golden; remove from heat.  Drain the pierogies well; add the
  cooked onions. Mix lightly to combine. Cover and keep warm. Place the
  goose on a large serving platter; cover loosely with foil to keep
  warm. Remove the remaining fat from the pan and place the pan
  drippings into a glass measure; let any fat rise to the surface and
  discard. Reserve 1/3 cup of the drippings. Set the roasting pan on
  top of the stove. Add the reserved drippings. Saute the chopped neck
  meat and liver for 5 minutes or until cooked. Blend in the flour;
  cook, stirring constantly, until bubbly. Stir in the broth; cook and
  stir until the mixture thickens and bubbles, about 3 minutes. Stir in
  the remaining teaspoon of thyme.  Pour into a gravy boat. Arrange the
  pierogie around the goose or place in a separate bowl. Serve with
  gravy.

  This recipe comes from Jean Charest's mother-in-law, Lisette Dionne.
  "It must be Canadian lamb with lots of garlic, cooked rare, along
  with potato casserole layered with Emmental cheese from the
  St.-Benoit-du-Lac monastery in my region." Jean Charest is one of the
  front runners of the Conservative leadership candidates, one of whom

  green peppers, poblano, ancho, tomatoes, and onions. Sprinkle the
  reserved spice mixture over the vegetables and cook over medium heat,
  stirring frequently until they are soft., about 15 minutes. Pour the
  red wine over the veggies and cook until the mixture is reduced to
  just a glaze. Pour in the veal stock and continue cooking over medium
  heat until the liquid is reduced by about half, about 15 minutes.
  Crumble the reserved bacon into the sauce. Keep it warm while
  finishing the roast.
  
  6. Return the pork roast to the oven at 375F. Cook 20 to 25 minutes,
  until a meat thermometer inserted in the center reads 137 degrees.
  Remove from the oven and transfer to a rack. Let cool slightly before
  slicing into medallions.
  
  7. Serve the roast on a pool of the veggie sauce, with corn pudding
  on the side.

  the seasonings into the meat. Set the loin on a rack in a roasting
  pan and roast, basting frequently with the pan juices, until
  medium-rare (about 135F on a meat thermometer), 25 to 30 minutes.
  Cover the venison loosely with foil and set aside for 10 to 15
  minutes before carving. Meanwhile, remove and discard the bay leaf
  and the lemon, orange and ginger slices from the cranberries. In a
  food processor or blender, puree half the cranberries and half the
  liquid until smooth. In a medium nonreactive saucepan, boil the wine
  over high heat until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 5 mintues.  Add the
  stock and bring to a boil. Add the cranberry puree, reduce the heat
  to low and simmer, uncovered, until slightly thickened, about 10
  minutes.  Remove from heat. Strain the reamining whole cranberrie and
  add them to the sauce with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon each of salt,
  pepper and chopped juniper berries. Swirl in the cold butter. Slice
  the venison thinly (stir any juices into the sauce) and serve wtih

 Categories: Chinese, Chicken
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 lb Chicken, cut in half
           Looing sauce:
      4 c  Water
      1 c  Light soy sauce
      1 c  Dark soy sauce
      1    Star anise
    1/2 c  Dry sherry
      5 tb Sugar
      4 sl Fresh ginger
           Additional
      6 c  Peanut oil for deep frying
 
  Blanch the chicken halves in boiling water for 2 minutes. Drain.
  Place the bird halves in a pot with the looing sauce ingredients and
  bring to a boil. They should be covered with the sauce.  Turn the
  heat to a simmer and cook lightly for 15 minutes, then allow the
  halves to cool in the sauce. Remove and place on a rack on the
  counter. Pat dry with paper towels and dry the meat using an electric
  fan.  Aim the fan at the bird halves for about 3 hours, or until the
  skin is dry to the touch. Deep fry one half at a time in oil at 350
  degrees.  Be very careful when sliding the half into the hot oil.  A
  wok lid will be helpful in protecting your hands and face in case the
  oil should pop and spit at you. Deep fry each half until the skin is
  crispy and golden.  Drain on paper towels before cutting up to serve.

  pan. Save them to flavor soup, stocks, or eggs. Remove the loaf and
  place on a serving dish. Serve hot or cold with a tomato sauce.
  
  For children, you might like to turn it into a hedgehog by pressing
  almonds into the meat to create prickles and placing 3 olives to form
  eyes and a nose. This should be done before the meat goes into the
  oven.

      Title: ROAST PORK (CHAR SHU)
 Categories: Chinese, Meats, Pork
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Water
      6 tb Sugar
      1 tb Salt
    1/2 c  Dark soy sauce
    1/4 c  Rice wine
      1 cl Garlic
      3 sl Ginger root
      3 lb Pork -- butt, shoulder,
           Tenderloin
 
  PREPARATION:
  
  Heat water and add sugar and salt, stirring until melted. Remove from
  stove.  Add soy sauce and rice wine. Smash, peel, and mince garlic,
  and add to the soy sauce mixture. Peel and mince ginger root and add.
  Mix well. Place meat in a bowl and pour the mixture over it. If meat
  is not completely covered, you will need to turn it frequently as it
  marinates. Allow it to stand in the refrigerator for 48 hours. (You
  can cheat and make the marinating time shorter -- never shorter than
  6 hours -- but the longer the time, the more the meat will tenderize
  and absorb the fine flavor.) Pour off marinade, but do not wipe meat.
  Place the meat on a rack in a baking pan.
  
  COOKING:
  
  Heat oven to 450-degrees.  Bake the meat for 10 minutes. Reduce heat
  to 250-degrees and bake for 30 minutes. Turn meat over and bake for
  another 30 minutes.

      1    Pork loin, with rib bones
           - chine bone removed,
           -(about 6-to-7 lbs and
           - containing 11-or-12 chops)
      1 md Onion

  COMBINE SALT, PEPPER, THYME, garlic and oil in a blender or small food
  processor and blend to a paste-like consistency. Scrape into a small
  bowl. Place pork on a work surface, rub the surface with all the herb
  paste and place the loin in the refrigerator for 2 hours or up to 8
  hours. Preheat oven to 400F. Place the pork in the oven on a rack in
  a roasting pan and immediately reduce heat to 350F. Roast for 2
  hours. After 1 hour add the onions and celery. As the roast cooks,
  remove any excess fat with a basting bulb. The pork juices should run
  barely pink and the roast will continue to cook while it "rests." A
  meat thermometer should read 165F-to-170F in the thickest part of the
  roast. Remove the roasting pan from the oven and increase the heat to
  425F. Remove the roast to a plate to rest for 30 minutes before
  carving. Add the flour to the vegetables in the roasting pan, mix and
  replace in the oven for 15 minutes. Transfer the roasting pan to the
  stovetop, place over medium heat and add the broth, Southern Comfort
  and any juices that have escaped from the pork. Cook, stirring, until
  the gravy thickens. To serve, cut the loin into individual chops and
  arrange on a serving platter. Strain the gravy through a sieve or
  strainer into a sauceboat and serve on the side.

      2    Cloves garlic; crushed (or3)
    1/4 c  Olive oil
    1/4 ts Black peppercorns; crushed
      2 lb Pork loin, center-cut;
           -boneless
      2 c  Veal stock; divided use*
      2 md Apples, tart; (Granny Smith
           -or Braeburn)
      1 tb Olive oil
    1/4 c  Shallots; chopped
      1 oz Fresh basil leaves; chopped
           -(about 1/2 cup)
    1/4 c  Calvados apple brandy**
      1 tb Cornstarch
           Salt & pepper to taste
 
  * Defatted chicken stock or chicken broth may be substituted for the
  veal stock. Frozen concentrated stock, which need not be defatted, is
  sold at some specialty markets. "Perfect Addition" is a line of
  frozen concentrated stock bases. It has just introduced a veal stock,
  which isn't yet in full distribution.
  
  **Brandy or Armagnac may be substituted for the Calvados.
  
  1. Combine sage, garlic, 1/4 cup olive oil and peppercorns in a
  shallow glass or other non-metal dish. Place pork loin in dish and
  pat sage-garlic mixture on all sides. Cover and marinate in the
  refrigerator at least 8 hours or overnight.
  
  2. Place pork on a rack in a roasting pan. Roast in a preheated
  450-degree oven for 15 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 350 degrees
  and roast until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees, about
  25 to
       30    more minutes.
  
  3. Transfer meat to a hot platter. Cover with aluminum foil or place
  in a warm oven to keep warm. Let meat rest for several minutes before
  slicing.
  
  4. Meanwhile, add 1/4 cup of hot stock to pan. With a fork or a wooden
  spoon, scrape up browned bits from bottom of pan. Skim off fat. Pour
  drippings into a cup.
  
  5. To make the sauce: Core apples, but do not peel them. Chop into
  1-inch cubes. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium saucepan. Add
  shallots and saute over medium heat until lightly browned, about 3 to
  5 minutes. Add apples and basil, stirring to combine. Add Calvados.
  Raise heat to medium-high. Stand back and ignite sauce with a long
  match. (Or pour Calvados into a heat-safe ladle and ignite, then pour
  into pan.) Stir in pan drippings and remaining 1 3/4 cup veal stock;
  continue cooking over low heat for 15 minutes to reduce sauce.
  Dissolve cornstarch in 2 tablespoons cold water and stir it into the
  pan. Bring mixture to a full boil. Cook, stirring often, until sauce
  thickens, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Season with salt and
  pepper. Serve immediately alongside pork.

      2 ts Black Peppercorns; cracked
           Salt
    1/8 ts Cayenne Pepper
      3 lb Boneless Pork Loin; rolled
           -and tied
  1 1/2 lb Small Zucchini; cut into
           -1/2" thick coins
           Cracked Black Pepper
      1 tb Olive Oil
    1/2 c  White Wine
 
  Mash garlic cloves by smashing them with the side of a French chef's
  knife. Strip the rosemary needles from the stem and add them to the
  garlic along with the cracked peppercorns, cayenne pepper and salt.
  Rub this mixture over the outside of the meat.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400øF. Spray a baking pan with nonstick cooking
  spray. Place the loin in the prepared baking pan. Roast the pork in
  the oven until it begins to brown, about 20 minutes. Then, add 1/2
  cup water to the pan and turn the meat over, using tongs.
  
  Meanwhile, toss the zucchini coins with salt and pepper to taste,
  then with olive oil to coat. Add the zucchini to the bottom of the
  roasting pan the last 30 minutes of roasting time. Roast the meat
  about 1 1/2 hours total, or until it has reached an internal
  temperature of 170øF., adding 1/4 cup water at a time every 20
  minutes or so when the pan becomes dry.
  
  Remove cooked meat to a board and let cool 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile,
  remove any excess fat from the roasting pan. Add 1/4 cup wine to the
  pan and boil , deglazing the pan, scraping up the bottom bits and
  making a sauce. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper.
  
  To serve, arrange zucchini in a bed on a warmed platter. Slice the
  meat into 3/4" thick slices and fan these out over the zucchini.
  Spoon the sauce over all and serve.

  Possums are roasted with hide on, so prepare a large pot of scalding
  hot water. Dip possum in it for a few minutes, then remove the hair
  by scraping with a dull knife, as you would scrape a hog. If some
  hair comes off hard, dip again in scalding (not hard-boiling) water.
  Wash with soap and water, then remove entrails, keeping washed liver.
  Remove head and tail (some people keep the head on). Soak in cold
  water to which is added 1 cup salt. Drain and rinse with boiling
  water. Stuff with possum stuffing, close the opening, and roast in
  black iron pot with a little water for 1-1/2 hours at 350. Baste
  often. SEE possum stuffing recipe. Add sweet potatoes 1 hour before
  possum is done.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 c  Milk
      3 tb Butter, unsalted
    3/4 c  Cornmeal
      3 tb Cream, sour
  2 1/2 tb Cheese, Gruyere, grated
  2 1/2 tb Cheese, Parmesan, grated
    1/3 c  Cheese, Gorgonzola,
           -- crumbled PLUS 6 thin

  Set aside.
  
       Tie the ginger, cinnamon sticks, chili and vanilla bean in
  cheesecloth and set aside.
  
       Place the sugar in a heavy large skillet, preferably one with
  straight sides.  Stir constantly over high heat until sugar turns
  light amber. The sugar must be cooked carefully to prevent burning;
  break up lumps as you go.  (If there are still lumps of sugar after
  it begins to color, work over low heat, or off heat, until mixture is
  smooth.)
  
       Stir in the orange, the lime and the bag of spices, and cook
  over high heat, stirring constantly for 5 minutes.  Fold in the
  raisins and cranberries, stirring gently to coat with caramelized
  sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring gently, until about half of
  the cranberries pop open, about 10 minutes.  Remove the pan from the
  heat and cool.
  
       Remove the bag of spices and spoon the relish into sterilized
  jars. Cover tightly and refrigerate for 1 month.  This relish keeps
  about 3 months.

        1    toothpick through both legs.
  
       Heat the olive oil in a large heavy skillet over very high heat.
  Arrange birds in pan, breasts down.  Saute, shaking pan occasionally
  until breasts are lightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes.  Place the skillet
  in the oven and roast 5 to 6 minutes.  Use tongs to turn birds'
  breasts up and continue to roast until golden brown, about 6 minutes.
  Remove the skillet from the oven and transfer the quail to 6 warm
  serving plates; keep warm while preparing sauce.
  
       Discard any fat from the skillet and place the pan over
  medium-high heat.  Deglaze the skillet, adding the gin and wine,
  scraping up any browned bits in a pan.  Add your stock and boil
  gently until reduced enough to coat a spoon lightly.  Stir in the
  remaining juniper berries, adjust your seasonings, and pour this over
  the birds. Serve immediately.

  into marble-sized balls and put under the beef to cook. Roast in a
  pre=heated oven, Gas Mark 6, 400F, 200C for 15 minutes per pound,
  plus an extra 15 minutes. You may need to turn the stuffing balls.
  Remove the beef, place on a warmed dish surrounded by the stuffing
  balls, cover with foil and stand in a warm place for 20 minutes while
  the sauce is made. Put the tin on the stove, pour in the stock and
  mix on a low heat to pick up all the juices and bits left in the pan.
  Mix together the egg yolks and the other ingredients except the flour
  mix. Put the egg mixture into the tin with the stock and bring to the
  boil stirring constantly. Stir in the flour, bring the sauce back to
  the boil and simmer until it thickens. Serve the sauce with the beef.

      Title: ROAST TARRAGON CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 lb Chicken
           - (roasting, broiling
           - or frying)
      2 ts Dry tarragon (or dbl. amt.)
           Freshly ground pepper
      4 tb Butter; at room temperature
      1 sm Carrot; sliced
      1    Celery stalk; sliced
      1 sm Onion; sliced
      1 tb Safflower oil
      2 tb Melted butter
      1 tb Minced shallots
  1 1/2 c  Chicken stock
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 425F. Lightly pepper the inside of chicken and smear
  with butter, then sprinkle with 2 teaspoons tarragon. Truss the
  chicken, then dry the outside thoroughly and rub with another 1
  tablespoon butter all over the skin.
  
  TO BROWN THE CHICKEN: Set the chicken on a rack, breast side up in the
  roasting pan, place in the oven for 5 minutes. Turn on its left side
  and baste quickly with the oil and butter, return to the oven for
  another 5 minutes. Turn on its right side for another
        5    minutes, basting as before.
  
  TO ROAST THE CHICKEN: Leave the chicken on its right side. Reduce oven
  temperature to 350F. Strew the vegetables under the chicken and baste
  it again. Leave it for a total of 15-20 minutes, basting it at least
  every 10 minutes. Salt the chicken, turn it on its other side, and
  cook another 15-20 minutes, basting at least every 10 minutes. Turn
  the chicken breast up and continue basting every 10 minutes until it
  is done.
  
  TO TELL IF THE CHICKEN IS DONE: Prick the thickest part of the
  drumstick with a fork. If the juices come out clear yellow, it is
  done. If not, roast another 5 minutes and test again. As a final
  check, lift the chicken and drain the juices from its vent into the
  pan; if the last few drops are clear yellow, it is definitely done.
  Put the chicken on a warm platter, remove the trussing string, and
  let it sit at least 5-10 minutes before carving so that the juices
  will not retreat into the tissues. It can wait a good 30 minutes with
  foil over it. Remove the vegetables and all but 2 tablespoons of fat
  from the pan, leaving as much of the brown juices as you can. Stir in
  the minced shallot and cook 2-3 minutes. Add the stock, 2 teaspoons
  of tarragon and boil rapidly over high heat. As the juices boil,
  scrape up coagulated juices (deglaze the pan) with a wooden spoon.
  Let the liquid reduce to about 1/2 cup. Carve the chicken at this
  point unless you are going to carve it at the table. Any juices may
  be added to the sauce. Just before serving, swirl the final 2
  tablespoons of butter into the hot sauce until it has been absorbed
  and lightly thickened. Dribble the sauce on the chicken, sprinkle
  with minced parsley.

      Title: ROAST TURKEY WITH CHESTNUT STUFFING
 Categories: Harned 1994, Main dish, Nuts, Pork, Poultry
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    Fresh turkey; with giblets
           -- (10 to 12 lbs.)
      4 tb Unsalted butter (1/2 stick)
           -- at room temperature
      1 lb Fresh chestnuts; peeled*
      3 c  ;Water
      1 lb Pork sausage
      2    Shallots; peeled
           -- finely chopped
    1/4 c  Fresh parsley; fine chopped
      4    Fresh thyme sprigs or
    1/2 ts Dried thyme
      1    Bay leaf
           Salt and pepper; to taste
      2    Garlic cloves
           -- peeled and minced
      2    Eggs; beaten
      1 c  Dry white wine
      2 lg Onions; peeled
           -- each cut into 8 wedges
      4 md Carrots; peeled
           -- cut in 2" pieces
 
  *To peel chestnuts, make a small cut on the flat side of each
  chestnut, making sure to cut all the way through the outer skin.
  Place chestnuts in a medium-size saucepan, cover with water, and
  bring to a boil over high heat. Then reduce heat to low.  Remove
  several chestnuts from the water and peel them with a sharp paring
  knife, being sure to remove both the outer peel and the dark inner
  skin that is attached to the meat. If the chestnuts cool before you
  have a chance to peel them, place them back in the water to heat, as
  it is virtually impossible to remove the inner skin when the chestnut
  is cool.
  
  Remove giblets and neck from the turkey; set aside. Rinse the turkey
  well inside and out until the water runs clear. Pat it thoroughly
  dry. Carefully separate the skin from the breast by running your
  fingers between the skin and the meat, being careful not to poke any
  holes in the skin. Spread the butter on the meat.
  
  Bring the water to a boil in a vegetable steamer over high heat. Add
  the chestnuts, cover, and steam until they are tender, about 30
  minutes. Remove the steamer basket from the heat.
  
  In a medium-size bowl, gently break the chestnuts into bite-size
  pieces. Mixing well after each addition, stir in the pork, shallots,
  herbs, salt and pepper, garlic and eggs. Chop giblets and add them to
  the mixture, mixing well.  To test for seasoning, pinch off a
  teaspoon of the mixture and cook it in a small skillet over medium
  heat until it is cooked through. Taste for seasoning and adjust
  accordingly.
  
  Fill the turkey with as much stuffing as it will hold, but don't pack
  it tightly.  Truss the turkey.  Place the turkey in a large roasting
  pan, and pour wine around it. Roast at 350 F. until turkey is golden,
  basting every 30 minutes with pan liquids.  If the breast is browning
  too quickly, cover it loosely with aluminum foil. After 2 hours, add
  the onions and carrots to the pan, spacing them evenly around the
  turkey. The turkey is done when the skin is golden, the thigh is
  tender when pressed, and the leg joints move easily up and down in
  their sockets, 3 to 3 1/2 hours more.
  
  Remove turkey from the oven and from the roasting pan; let it rest
  for at least 30 minutes or as long as 45 minutes before carving.
  While it is resting, turn the turkey over so it is resting on its
  breast. Prop the legs so they are slightly higher than the breast,
  allowing juices to run back into the breast meat. Reduce the cooking
  juices slightly over medium-high heat, about 2 minutes, scraping up
  any brown bits. Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Strain juices
  and pour into a gravy boat.
  
  Scoop out the stuffing into a serving dish and keep warm while you
  carve the turkey.  Serve; pass the gravy boat.
  
  Yield: 8 to 10 servings.
  
  The stuffing is good for any poultry, and can be cooked on its own and
  served as a side dish to pork roast as well. To cook the stuffing
  separately, bake it in a covered dish at 350 F. until it is nearly
  cooked all the way through, about 30 minutes.  Then remove the cover
  and continue cooking until it has browned slightly on top and is
  clearly cooked through, an additional 10 to 15 minutes.  If you cook
  the stuffing separately, your turkey may take slightly less time to
  cook.
  
  Also good accompanied by either a red Burgundy or a Volnay.

  1. Preheat oven to 425'F.~ 2. Cut butter into very thin slices; place
  in freezer to harden while you prepare bird.~ 3. Wash turkey inside
  and out. Remove and reserve neck, giblets and wing tips. Pat dry with
  paper toweling. Starting at the breast, separate the skin from the
  meat by working your fingers between them. Slice your hand under skin
  as far as you can go and gently free the skin on both sides of the
  breast. Loosen it around the upper part of the legs, stopping about
  halfway down the legs. Insert slices of the cold butter, first under
  the leg skin, then under the breast skin. Reshape the loosened skin
  on the bird by patting it gently back in place. It will sag a bit but
  don't let that upset you; it will cook back in place. Wrap bird
  loosely in waxed paper and refrigerate while preparing stuffing.~ 4.

      Title: ROAST VENISON
 Categories: Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 lb Venison roast(elk,moose,deer
      2 tb Flour
      2    Cloves garlic (minced)
      2 tb Brown sugar
      1 ts Prepared mustard
      1 tb Worcestershire sauce
    1/4 c  Vinegar or lemon juice
      1 lg Onion (sliced)
      1 cn Tomatoes (14 oz can)
           MARINADE
    1/2 c  Vinegar
      2    Cloves garlic (minced)
      1 tb Salt
    1/2 c  Red wine
           Cold water to cover meat
 
  Let the meat stand at room temperature for 8 hours then marinade the
  venison over night in the refrigerator. This opens the pores of the
  meat when at room temp and when cooling will draw in the marinade.
  Season with salt, roll in flour and brown in hot skillet. Place in
  crock-pot cooker and add remaining ingredients. Cover and cook on low
  10 to 12 hours.
  
  MARINADE: Mix ingredients together in a bowl just large enough to
  cover venison with water. No need to stir this marinade. Use for
  "red" meats or game birds.

  Soak one large duck or 2 mallards in marinade (See Page 57) overnight
  in refrigerator. Season inside and out with salt and pepper. Brown

  flavor). Place 2 cut up carrots in bottom of CROCK-POT to act as rack
  for bird(s). Put stuffed duck(s) in pot. Add 1/2 cup sauterne, dry
  vermouth or water. Cover and cook on High 2 hours, then turn to Low
  for 8 hours. Before serving, remove chopped vegetables from each

 Categories: Side dishes, Vegetables, Kooknet
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      5 lg Walla Walla Onions, peeled
           And halved
    1/4 c  Extra Virgin Olive Oil
    1/4 c  Basalmic Vinegar
      2 tb Butter, melted
           Salt and White Pepper
 
  Create a 10x14" roasting pan with at least 2 layers of heavy-duty
  aluminimum foil by bending the edges up into 2" high sides and
  crimping the corners to hold them in place. Lay the onions in the
  pan, cut-side up. Combine the olive oil, vinegar and butter and pour
  over the onions, Bank hot coals on two sides of the bottom of a
  barbecue. Place the foil pan of onions on the grill, centered between
  the banks of coals below. Cover the grill and bake, gently turning
  the onions and basting them with the pan juices about ever 15-20
  minutes, until they are deep-golden and very soft when pressed. This
  will take about 1-1 1/2 hours. Ultimately, they will break apart
  somewhat, so don't be too concerned about keeping them whole. Serve
  hot or at room temperature, as an accompaniment to grilled or
  oven-roasted fish, poultry or beef.

      Title: ROASTED CHICKEN BREASTS WITH CRANBERRY PORT S
 Categories: Poultry, Vegetables, Main dish
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
     12 ea Chicken breasts, boneless

MMMMM--------------------------STUFFING-------------------------------
      2 tb Butter
      1 md Onion, finely chopped
      1 lb Mushrooms, finely chopped
      3 ea Zucchini, grated and drained
      1 ts Tarragon, dried
    1/2 c  Whipping cream
      2 tb Lemon juice
    1/4 c  Breadcrumbs
    1/4 c  Parsley, finely chopped
           Salt
           Pepper, fresh ground

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
    1/2 c  Port
      1 c  Red wine
      2 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Cranberries, dried
      2 c  Chicken stock
 
  To buy boneless chicken breasts with the skin on, purchase chicken
  breasts on the bone and ask your butcher or supermarket to remove the
  bones but leave the skin intact. It is a much more beautiful
  presentation and it keeps the chicken moist. Bones can be used to
  make stock or discarded. If you prefer, or can only obtain skinless
  chicken, then make a cut on the bottom of each breast the length of
  the breast to form a pocket. Stuff each breast with same amount of
  filling and turn slit side down. Brush top with a film of Dijon
  mustard and continue with recipe. To heighten mushroom flavour, add
  one 10g package of soaked dried mushrooms along with the regular
  mushrooms, if desired. Dried currents may be substituted for
  cranberries. Trim chicken breasts of any fat. Heat butter in skillet
  on medium high heat. Add onion, saute until softened the add
  mushrooms and zucchini. Saute until all liquid has evaporated,
  stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Stir in tarragon and cream.
  Continue to cook until cream has reduced and mixture is thick, about
  5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice and add enough breadcrumbs to hold
  mixture together. Add parsely and season well with salt and pepper.
  Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. With fingertips, make a
  pocket between skin and flesh of each chicken breast. Stuff about 1/3
  c filling under skin, tucking skin around breast to enclose stuffing.
  Place chicken breasts in large oiled (preferably metal) baking dish
  or roasting pan. Dot with butter, refrigerate until one hour before
  baking. Baking in 400F (200C) oven for 30 to 40 minutes or until
  juices run clear. If skin is not quite crisp enough, place under
  broiler to crisp it. While chicken is baking, place sauce ingredients
  in pot and bring to boil over medium high heat. Reduce by half,
  skimming occasionally, about 25 minutes. Over low heat, whisk in
  butter, 1 tb at a time, until sauce is slightly thickened and glossy.
  Just before serving, skim any fat off pan juices and add juices to
  sauce. Either slice chicken breasts into 1/4 inch slices before
  serving and coat with sauce or serve chicken breasts whole and place
  sauce in sauce boat. Garnish with extra dried cranberries, if desired.

 Categories: Thai, Condiment
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Small Dried Red Chilies
    1/2 c  Unpeeled Shallots, Halved
           Lengthwise
    1/4 c  Unpeeled Garlic Cloves,
           Halved Lengthwise
    1/2 c  Vegetable Oil
 
  In a wok or small, heavy skillet, dry-fry the chilies over low heat
  until they darken and become fragrant and brittle, about 5 minutes.
  Shake the pan and stir frequently as they roast. Remove from the heat
  and transfer to a small plate to cool.  In the same pan over medium
  heat, dry-fry the shallots and garlic, turning occasionally, until
  they are softened, wilted and blistered, 5 minutes.  They should have
  small, black burnt spots but not be burned all over.  Remove from the
  heat and transfer to a small plate to cool. Stem the chilies and
  shake out and discard most of the seeds. Cut the chilies into small
  pieces.  Trim the shallots and garlic, discarding the peels and root
  ends, and cut them into small pieces. Combine the chilies, garlic and
  shallots in a large, heavy mortar. Pound and grind with a pestle
  until you have a fairly smooth paste, 20 to 30 minutes. Use a spoon
  to scrape the sides down now and then. Set aside. In a wok or small,
  deep skillet over medium heat, warm the oil for 1 minute. Add the
  paste and cook, stirring occasionally until the paste slowly darkens
  to a deep brownish black and releases a rich fragrance, about 5
  minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer the chili paste, with it's
  oil, to a jar. Cool to room temperature uncovered, then seal tightly.
  It will keep at room temperature for 1 month.  Makes about 1-1/2 cups.

      Title: ROASTED CUMIN
 Categories: Digest, Spices, Indian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 x  Raw cumin
 
  Most indians do not buy the stuff because it looses so much flavor
  (much like fresh ground pepper vs packaged ground pepper). instead,
  what i do is to buy raw cumin (ask them to sell you good quality
  "zeera" if you go to an indian store). to roast them, in a heavy
  skillet/frying pan, put in a handful (crushing them slightly by
  rubbing them between the palms of your two hands) and then over
  med-high heat roast them dry, shaking the skillet a lot, until they
  are dark brown in color (but not black, over roasting them will turn
  them black). use immediately as is. (ps: crushing the raw cumin is
  really important to bring out the nice flavor of cumin, try a
  side-by-side some time, and you'll see what i mean. this tip is
  courtesy of our family cook in india, who likes to load everything he
  cooks with cumin).
  
  For some dishes, like raita (raita == slightly whipped yougurt +
  <favorite veges, like cukes, onions, tomatoes etc> + roasted cumin
  powder + salt + pepper) you need to powder it. what i do is to put
  the roasted cumin on my cutting board, and with a roller pin go over
  it, and they powder with almost no effort.

 Categories: Indian, Sauces
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 md Eggplants (1 pound)
    1/2 ts + tb mild vegetable oil
    1/4 ts Mustard seeds
    1/4 ts Cumin seeds
    1/2 c  Chopped onion
    1/8 ts Turmeric
      1    Fresh hot green chile,
           -minced
    1/2 c  Peeled, chopped tomato
    1/4 ts Curry powder
    1/2 ts Salt, or to taste
    1/2 ts Sugar
           Chopped fresh cilantro,
           -for garnish
 
  This expensive restaurant dish is easy to make at home. Although it is
  found in both northern and southern India, it is prepared very
  differently in each region. The following recipe is the northern
  version.
  
  Brush eggplant all over with 1/2 teaspoon oil. Preheat the broiler,
  prepare a charcoal grill or place the eggplant directly over a gas
  burner. Cook, turning occasionally, until the skin is completely
  charred and the pulp is soft, about 30 minutes. Let cool briefly.
  Slit open and scoop pulp out onto a cutting board. Chop coarsely.
  
  Heat remaining oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add
  mustard and cumin. When seeds pop (takes about 1 minute), add onion,
  turmeric and chile. Stir and cook 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomato,
  eggplant and curry powder. Reduce heat to medium, cover and cook,
  stirring occasionally, about 6 minutes. Season to taste with salt and
  sugar. Garnish with cilantro.
  
  Serve warm or at room temperature.
  
  Variation: In southern India, eggplant is roasted, peeled and allowed
  to cool. Yogurt (about 1 cup per 1-pound eggplant) is stirred in to
  make a creamy mixture, then the dish is seasoned with turmeric,
  mustard and plenty of fresh curry leaves. It is served as a cooling
  salad alongside spicy dishes.

      1 tb Minced fresh or 1 teaspoon
           -dry thyme leaves
           Salt and pepper
 
  Place potatoes in an 8- to 9-inch-square pan and set on a rack in
  upper half of a 425F oven.  Bake for 20 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, with kitchen scissors or a knife, split hens in half,
  cutting along backbone and breastbone. Rinse and pat dry. Reserve
  neck and giblets for another use. [Hardly! They'd go right into the
  pan too... S.C.] Mix mustard, honey, wine and thyme.  Rub all over
  hens.
  
  Place hens, skin up, on a rack in a foil-lined 12- by 15-inch broiler
  pan.
  
  Set hens in bottom third of the oven.  Bake until potatoes are tender
  when pierced and meat is no longer pink at thigh bone (cut to test),
  25 to 30 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Serves 4.
  
  This is from the March '91 Sunset Magazine.  The article recommends

      Title: ROASTED GARLIC
 Categories: Garlic, Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 x  Whole Heads Of Garlic
      1 x  Toasted Rounds French Bread
      1 x  Softened Sweet Butter
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Remove the papery outer covering of
  whole garlic head, but do not seperate the cloves or peel them. Place
  as many whole heads of garlic on a large square of heavy-duty
  aluminum foil as there are people to be served. Fold up foil so that
  the cloves are completely wrapped. Bake in the preheated oven for 1
  hour 15 minutes. Serve each diner a head of garlic and some bread and
  butter. Separate cloves. Hold a clove over a piece of buttered bread
  and squeeze. The garlic puree will pop out, like toothpaste from a
  tube. Spread and eat. GARLIC PUREE: To make a batch of Garlic Puree
  for later use, let roasted heads of garlic cool, unwarapped for at
  least 5 minutes. Gently separate the cloves and squeeze each one over
  a fine meshed sieve, so that the softened garlic pops into the sieve.
  With wooden spatula or wooden spoon, rub garlic through the sieve
  into a small container or bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and
  refrigerate the puree if needed. QUICK PUREE: If you are in a hurry,
  you may skip the refinement of the sieve. Simply squeeze the cloves,
  one by one, over a bowl. When they have all been squeezed, use a
  rubber spatula to push the puree into a neat mound cover tightly with
  plastic wrap, and refrigerate until needed. It will keep for months.
  To keep indefinitely, cover with a film of olive oil.

      1 x  INGREDIENTS
      1 c  Chopped green onions
    1/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
    1/4 c  Hot pepper sauce
    1/4 c  Cajun spice blend
    3/4 c  Packed cup garlic cloves,

    1/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
    1/4 c  Hot pepper sauce
    1/4 c  Cajun spice blend
 
  The original version calls for running vegetables through a meat
  grinder. However, you can coarsely chop small batches with a food
  processor using on-off pulses. Preliminaries: Build a charcoal fire,
  then scatter presoaked mesquite chips over the coals. Using a mesh
  grilling rack, grill garlic cloves, turning often until golden brown.
  Remove from grill; reserve. Grill tomatoes, onions and chiles over
  glowing coals, turning frequently, until skin is charred. Remove from
  grill and leave skin on vegetables. Procedure: Core tomatoes; remove
  stems (not seeds or veins) from chiles. Cut tomatoes, onions, and
  chiles into chunks. Place in food processor or blender, then pulse
  on-off until mixture forms small, firm pieces. Thoroughly combine
  ground vegetables with remaining ingredients. Cover; chill at least
  24 hours before serving. Yields about 8-10 cups.

  aluminum foil and bake for 1 hour, or until each clove is soft to the
  touch and the skin resembles lightly browned parchment. Serve the
  garlic with the cooking juices spooned over and pass goat cheese and
  bread separately. To eat, break off a piece of bread and spread with
  a small amount of cheese, then scoop out the garlic puree from one of
  the cloves with the tip of a knife and spread on top.

      Title: ROASTED GARLIC WITH GOATS CHEESE
 Categories: Cheese/eggs, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Bulbs garlic
      2    Bay leaves, snapped in half
      4    Sprigs rosemary
           Juice 1/2 lemon
      4 tb Olive oil
      4 oz Soft goats cheese
    1/8 pt Double cream (2 fl oz)
      2 tb Fresh coriander, chopped
      1    Plump red chilli pepper
           -deseeded, chopped
      1    Lemon quartered lengthways
           Hot crusty toast
           Salt & pepper
 
  Preheat the oven to gas Mark 6, 400øF, 200øC
  
  Use scissors to cur away the thick central stem from the garlic bulbs
  and slice about 1/4in off the top of each bulb. Pack the bulbs into a
  small ovenproof dish, tuck half a bayleaf into each bulb, season
  generously with the salt and pepper, and cover with the sprig of
  rosemary. Squeeze over the lemon juice and anoint with olive oil.
  Cover loosely with baking pachment. Cook, basting a couple of times,
  for 35 minutes or until the garlic is soft and squashy to the touch.
  
  Meanwhile, mash the goat's cheese and stir in the cream to make a
  smooth, thick paste.  Mix in the coriander and chilli.
  
  Allow the garlic to cool slightly and serve it in its dish. The thing
  to do is to let everyone help themselves to a bulb of garlic and some
  of the cooking juices. Serve the goats cheese separately, with plenty
  of hot crusty toast and lemon wedges to squeeze over the top.

      Title: ROASTED HABANERO SALSA FROM HELL
 Categories: Appetizers, Sauces, Dips
      Yield: 2 Cups
 
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 ts Garlic, minced
      6 ea Plum tomatoes, halved
           Salt & pepper, to taste
     10 ea Habanero chili peppers,
           -- stemmed
    1/4 c  Olive oil
    1/4 c  Lime juice
    1/4 c  Cilantro, chopped
           Protective gloves
 
  Combine the Tablespoon of olive oil and garlic and mix well. Rub
  tomato halves with this mixture, sprinkle with salt and freshly
  cracked pepper and roast in a 500F oven until they begin to take on
  some serious color, about 15 - 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and
  let cool to room temperature and dice.  Meanwhile, grill the 10
  habanero peppers over a medium-hot fire until slightly colored, 2 - 3
  minutes.  Remove peppers from fire and mince. Be very careful when
  working with this pepper. Wear gloves while mincing it, and if any
  juice gets on your skin, wash it off with a mild bleach solution.
  This neutralizes the capsaicin. Also, do not rub your eyes, and wash
  you hands well after you are finished. In a medium bowl, combine
  tomatoes, peppers, 1/4 cup olive oil, lime juice, and cilantro. Mix
  well, and prepare for take-off! This salsa will keep, covered and
  refrigerated, for 5 - 6 weeks, mainly because no mold or bacteria
  would dare to come near the stuff!

      Title: ROASTED KABOCHA SQUASH & GREEN TOMATOES
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 md Kabocha squash; about 3 lb
      2 lb Green tomatoes
  1 1/2 lb Red onions
  1 1/4 lb Red potatoes, small
      6    Cloves garlic; up to 8
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 ts Salt; or more
 
  Peel the squash, seed it, and cut it in 3/4-inch cubes. The best
  method to do this is to cut the squash in half with your biggest,
  sharpest knife, and scoop out the seeds. Then lay the halves cut side
  down and slice them in wide strips. Lay the strips on their sides and
  cut off the thick, hard rind in pieces, then cube the orange flesh.
  This method allows you to keep the cutting edge of your knife always
  safely aimed down toward the board, very important when applying
  pressure to a tough hide.
  
  Cut the green tomatoes in 1-inch chuncks. Peel the red onions and cut
  them in thin wedges. Scrub the potatoes and cut them in pieces no
  larger than the squash pieces. Peel the garlic cloves and slice the
  larger ones in half lengthwise.
  
  Toss all the vegetables together with the olive oil and salt until
  they are evenly coated, spread them on two baking sheets, and roast
  them at 400 degrees for about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours. Stir and turn the
  vegetables a couple times in the course of the cooking time. They
  should be perfectly tender, with crisped, browned edges here and
  there.
  
  Serve the vegetables with Couscous with Moroccan Spices.

 Categories: 
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Red bell peppers
      3 tb Extra virgin olive oil
     10    Basil leaves
           Coarse sea salt to taste
      4 c  Organic arugula
      1 ts Garlic puree
           Cracked white pepper to
           Taste
      1 ga Water
      1 c  French green beans
     12 lg Fresh langoustines
      2 ts 100 yearold balsamic vinegar
 
  Roast the whole bell peppers over a mesquite grill until completely
  charred and cooked. Remove from grill and place in a covered
  container to allow to steam. When the peppers are cool, remove the
  charred skins but do not rinse off the essential oils and juices.
  Remove the seeds and white membranes and discard them. Tear the
  peppers into four lobes and marinate with half of the olive oil, all
  of the basil leaves, and coarse sea salt. Reserve at room
  temperature. Heat one tablespoon of olive oil in a heavy sautJ pan.
  When oil is hot, wilt the leaves of arugula and add the garlic puree,
  salt, and pepper. Cool at room temperature and reserve. Blanch the
  trimmed green beans in one gallon of boiling salted water for three
  to four minutes. The beans must have texture but not be crispy or al
  dente. Refresh in ice water and remove from ice as soon as beans are
  cooled. Remove the heads from the langoustines and remove the shell
  from the tail, leaving the end tail piece on. Always work on ice when
  cleaning sea food, especially crustations. Put a toothpick through
  the langoustine. In a heavy sautJ pan, heat one tablespoon of olive
  oil. Sear the langoustines in hot oil until evenly golden brown. Set
  aside in a warm place. The langoustines should cook for only one
  minute total; thirty seconds on each side. Presentation: Place a
  small mound of the wilted arugula in a deep, large bowl and place the
  marinated pepper strips on top. Place three langoustines on the
  peppers. Toss the green beans in extra virgin olive oil and place as
  garnish. Drizzle with a few drops of the old vinegar and serve hot.

      Title: ROASTED MARINATED CRAB
 Categories: Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1    Live crab, 2 to 2 1/2 pounds
      3 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Shredded ginger
      1 tb Chopped garlic
      2    Serrano or other small
           -green chiles, chopped
           Freshly ground black pepper
      2    To 4 tablespoons butter
           Salt to taste
 
  To kill the crab, either plunge it into a large pot of boiling water
  for a minute, or place it on its back on a cutting board and split
  the body down the middle with one quick cut with a heavy knife or
  Chinese cleaver. If you want to use the upper shell in the
  presentation, the first technique works better.
  
  Holding the crab body by the legs, pull off the shell. Discard the
  feathery gills on both sides of the body and the spongy mass in the
  middle of the back; rinse until nothing but shell and meat show. Pull
  out the bits of greenish fat from the corners of the shell; reserve
  if desired for the sauce.  Rinse both the body and shell and drain
  thoroughly.
  
  Split the body of the crab (if it is not already split) into 2 halves
  with legs and claws still attached. Carefully crack each leg and claw
  segment with a mallet.
  
  Place in a large bowl with the oil, ginger, garlic, chiles and a
  generous grinding of pepper.  Marinate for 1 to 4 hours in the
  refrigerator.
  
  Remove crab from marinade 15 minutes before cooking. Grill the halves
  and the shell over a hot fire until outer shells are bright red and
  meat in the largest sections is opaque (pry one open to check), 3 to
  4 minutes per side.  Or , place crab halves and shell in a roasting
  pan lightly oiled with a bit of the marinade and roast in a 450F oven
  until done as described above, about 12 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile,
  strain vegetables out of marinade and combine with the butter in a
  saucepan. Simmer for 5 minutes and season to taste. Serve in small
  bowls as a dipping sauce for the crab.
  
  Serves 2.

      Title: ROASTED PEPPERS WITH MOZZARELLA & CARAMELIZ
 Categories: Italian, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 md Yellow and red bell peppers
      2 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
     18    Garlic cloves, sliced
    1/4 c  Plus 1-1/2 teaspoons
           Balsamic vinegar
      2    Sprigs of fresh thyme OR
    1/4 ts Dried
      6 oz Fresh mozzarella cheese,
           Sliced as thin as possible
    1/4 c  Coarsely chopped flat-leaf
           Parsley or fresh basil
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  1.  Roast the bell peppers directly over a gas flame or under the
  broiler as close to the heat as possible, turning, until charred all
  over, about 5 minutes. Enclose the peppers in a paper bag and set
  aside for 10 minutes to steam.  With a small knife, scrape off the
  blackened skin; remove the cores, seeds and ribs. Rinse under running
  water. Slice the peppers lengthwise into 1-inch strips.  (The recipe
  can be prepared to this point up to 3 days ahead; cover and
  refrigerate.) 2. In a small nonreactive skillet, combine the olive
  oil and garlic. Cover and cook over very low heat until the garlic is
  very tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Uncover the pan, increase the heat to
  moderate and cook until browned, about 2 minutes. Stir in the vinegar
  and thyme and cook for 1 minute. 3. To assemble, decoratively arrange
  the pepper strips and mozzarella slices on 6 small plates.  Spoon the
  caramelized garlic dressing over the peppers and cheese and sprinkle
  the parsley and black pepper on top. Serve at room temperature.  (The
  salad can be assembled up to 2 hours before serving.)

      2    Pork tenderloins, about 1
           -pound each
      2    Garlic cloves, minced
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper
      2 ts Dried oregano

      2    Bay leaves
      1    Onion, halved, stuck with 4
           -whole cloves
      1 c  Water
 
  Dry tenderloins well. Rub surfaces with minced garlic, salt, pepper
  and oregano. Heat olive oil in a heavy Dutch oven; add meat and brown
  very well, turning from time to time.
  
  Add the bay leaves, onion and water. Cover and place in a 350 degree
  F. oven for 1 1/2 hours. Check a couple of times to make sure there
  is liquid remaining in the pot. Add another 1/2 cup water, if
  necessary. Remove meat from pot and let cool 20 minutes, then slice.
  Pull meat into shreds with your fingers. I usually place the shredded
  pork and tinga sauce back into the Dutch oven with any remaining
  broth in the pot.

      Title: ROASTED POTATOES BURIED IN SEA SALT
 Categories: Potatoes, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     12 md New potatoes
      2 c  Coarse sea salt or Kosher
           - salt
 
  Try using red new potatoes or small yellow potatoes in this dish,
  burying them completely in the coarse sea salt or Kosher salt. The
  results -- crisp skin and soft, buttery insides -- with just the
  right amount of saltiness. The salt acts as a kind of "crust" without
  overwhelming the potatoes. Brush the hot salt off the potatoes using
  a pastry brush or your hands well wrapped in a pot holder.
  
  With the potatoes serve any roast.
  
  Directions: ~--------- Preheat oven to 350 F.
  
  Place the potatoes in a medium-size roasting pan or ovenproof
  skillet; do not crowd the pan. Pour the salt over the potatoes; there
  should be enough salt so that only the very tops of the potatoes peek
  through.
  
  Roast the potatoes until tender, about 45-minutes. Brush the salt off
  the potatoes before serving. Serve hot.

  :          black pepper to taste
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Leaving their skins on, scrub the
  potatoes with a brush to remove any dirt or blemishes. Dry the

  pan or large cast-iron skillet and heat in the oven 10 minutes before
  adding the potatoes.
  
  Roast the potatoes 45 minutes, until crisp. Shake the pan several

  together quickly, and remove from the heat. Pour the garlic-herb
  butter over the potatoes, season with the salt and pepper, and serve.

      Title: ROASTED PUMPKIN SEEDS
 Categories: Snacks
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1    Pumpkin
      2 tb Vegetable oil
           Salt to taste
 
  Scoop out the seeds and pulp from a pumpkin, and separate the pulp
  from the seeds, discarding the pulp.
  
  Rinse the seeds in a large colander under cold running water,
  removing any remaining clinging strings.  Seeds will feel slippery to
  the touch under the water.
  
  Dump seeds, a small amount at a time, into paper toweling and dry.
  Spread onto a large baking sheet and allow to finish air-drying for
  an hour or so. When seeds are dry, toss them with the vegetable oil
  to coat well and sprinkle liberally with salt.  Spread into a thin
  layer on the baking sheet and place in a 350 F oven for 30 minutes,
  or until golden brown, stirring every few minutes to prevent burning.
  
  Remove from the oven and allow to cool before serving.
  
  (These little suckers taste so good that roasted seeds rarely are
  allowed to cool much beyond just cool enough to touch before they get
  scarfed.)

      2 pk Active Dry Yeast

      1 c  Water; heat to 120F degrees

MMMMM-------------------------GLAZE ETC------------------------------
      1 tb Cornmeal; for cookie sheet
      2 tb Butter; melted
 
  :       Seenote; lightly spray a ripe red pepper with release spray
  and rub it around with your finger to coat the entire surface. Roast
  the pepper directly in the flames of a gas stove, turning them with
  tongs until the entire outside of the pepper is blackened. You do not
  want to cook the peppers too much so do this as quickly as your range
  will allow. You can also do this under a broiler, on the grill or
  with any type of blowtorch, but my range is more handy..
  :       In a large frying pan or skillet, cook the bacon over medium
  heat until browned and crispy. Remove the bacon, drain on paper
  towels and coarsely chop. Set aside. Add the onion to the reserved
  bacon drippings along with the olive oil. Stir to coat the onions
  evenly with the oil. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally,
  until the onions are a golden brown, about 20 minutes. NOTE: in this
  prior step it is important that the onions get browned and that most
  to all of the liquid is fryed out.
   Add the garlic and cook for 5 minutes more. Stir in the salt, pepper,
  roasted red peppers, black olives and chopped rosemary. Stir in the
  crumbled bacon. Set aside.
   In the work bowl of a food processor, using the plastic dough blade,
  combine 3 1/2 cups of flour and the sauteed onion/red pepper mixture.
  Add the yeast, eggs and the parmesan cheese and combine thoroughly.
  With the machine still running, add the water slowly until the
  mixture begins to pull together and forms a ball. Note: that is
  "begins to pull together", this will not be a rounded ball of dough.
  If the dough is too sticky, add the remaining flour 1/4 cup at a
  time. Process until the dough cleans the sides of the work bowl, then
  knead for approximately 1 minute longer. The dough should be smooth
  and elastic and bounce back when pressed with your finger. Place the
  dough into a lightly oiled freezer type plastic bag, and put in a
  warm place to double in volume, about 1 hour.(1 gallon bag for each
  loaf, freeze one, and continue with the other.) Remove the dough from
  bag and punch down, shape the dough into two oblong loaves, and place
  on a lightly greased baking sheet that has been dusted with the
  cornmeal. Make 3 or 4 decorative slashes in the top of the bread and
  brush with the melted butter. Allow to rise again, in a warm, draft
  free area until doubled, about 45 minutes. Place the dough into a
  preheated 375F degree oven and cook for 35-45 minutes or until the
  bread is golden and the bottom sounds hollow when tapped with your
  finger. Place the bread directly on a wire rack to cool. This bread
  freezes well for 2-3 months if tightly wrapped. To serve, defrost
  overnight in the foil. To warm, place the thawed bread, still wrapped
  in foil in a 350 degree oven for 15-20 minutes. If reheated in this
  manner, the bread will retain its freshly baked qualities.

      Title: ROASTED RED PEPPERS
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Red peppers, fresh
           -(sweet red capsicum
           -peppers)
    1/4 c  Lemon juice
           Salt
 
  Preheat broiler as hot as you can get it.  Turn red peppers under the
  broiler until their skins come up in black bubbles. Cool the peppers
  until you can handle them comfortably.
  
  Remove the skins, stems, cores and seeds.  (This is messy work. I have
  tried removing the innards first, before putting the peppers under the
  broiler, and the result is not so good as this way.)
  
  Cut the peppers into finger shapes.  Flavor them with fresh lemon
  juice and salt.  Let them sit for several hours, draining off the
  liquid that forms.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A low-calorie but flavorful red pepper salad -- Safeway got in
  their first carload of really cheap red peppers yesterday, and I made
  roasted pepper salad.
  
  Serve this at room temperature as a side dish for anything Nicoise or
  Spanish or Greek or Egyptian. Or make a meal of them by adding a bowl
  of yoghurt, a bowl of chopped onion, some black olives, radishes and
  pistachios, and lots of warm pita bread. Or use it with sauteed
  garlic and pitted black olives and a little reduced white wine as a
  spaghetti sauce. Yield: Serves 4.
  
  *  Now.  Here is the real point about this recipe: These roasted
  peppers are insanely delicious, smooth and unctuous and aromatic, and
  yet they contain absolutely no calories. A full-sized red pepper is
  only 15 calories.
  
  *  Of course I could lose weight if I never ate more than three
  tablespoons of anything. Any fool could do that. But I don't want to
  confine myself to three tablespoons. Perhaps my taste buds work more
  slowly that other people's.  I don't seem to get the hang of what I'm
  eating till the second serving, or sometimes the third.
  
  *  At the same time, I want things that are really voluptuous and
  good to eat, full of interesting, complicated flavors that will
  satisfy me and make me feel happy and rewarded. Again, any fool could
  lose weight by eating celery stalks and carrots. Unfortunately, any
  number of carrot sticks over six makes me grumpish, and raw celery
  turns me positively surly in short order unless accompanied by
  delicious, fattening sour cream and cream cheese.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, several hours aging.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

  Heat a small, dry skillet over medium-high heat.  Add rice and stir
  constantly as rice heats.  After several minutes it will have a
  lightly toasted aroma and will begin to turn pale brown. Keep
  stirring until all the rice has changed to a light tan color, then
  transfer to a spice grinder or mortar & pestle and grind to a fine

 Categories: Ethnic, Rice
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Raw glutinous rice
 
  Roasted rice powder is used as a flavoring and binding agent in
  various recipes throughout this book. It is necessary to soak the
  rice first in order to obtain a deep golden color after roasting.
  Soaking also makes the rice easier to grind.
  
  Soak the glutinous rice in warm water for 1 hour. Drain.
  
  Place the rice in a small skillet over moderate heat. Toast the rice,
  stirring constantly with chopsticks or a wooden spoon, until deep
  golden brown, about 15 minutes.
  
  Transfer the roasted rice to a spice grinder or blender and process
  to a fine powder (the powder should resemble saw dust). Sift the
  ground rice through a very fine sieve into a bowl. Discard the grainy
  bits. Store the rice powder in a tightly covered jar in your
  refrigerator and use as needed. It will keep for up to 3 months.

  This a method more so than a recipe.  For those who require
  quantities, I recommend about 1/4 cup oil, about 2 tsp seasoning
  salt, and about 2 TBS dried rosemary leaves. Cut potatoes into
  quarters, about bite-size pieces. Do not peel.  In a large bowl, toss
  potatoes in oil to coat. There shouldn't be a lot of oil left in the
  bowl. Sprinkle with seasoning salt and rosemary leaves, then turn a
  couple of times to coat. Cover a large baking sheet with aluminum
  foil and spray LIGHTLY with cooking spray. Place potatoes on a single
  layer on the sheet. Roast in a pre-heated 400 degree oven for 45 to
  55 minutes, until golden brown and slightly puffed. You may turn
  potatoes once, after 25 minutes, if you wish. Serve ASAP from oven.

      2    To 2-1/2 lbs. spare ribs
      1 tb Black beans
      2    Thin slices ginger root
      1    Scallion
      1 cl Garlic
      4 tb Soy sauce
      4 tb Honey
      3 tb Hoisin sauce
      1 tb Rice Wine
      1 c  Chicken broth
      2 tb Oil
 
  PREPARATION:
  
  Remove as much fat and gristle as you can from the meat and cut apart
  into individual ribs.  Wash black beans and mash. Mince ginger root
  and the scallion. Smash, peel, and mince garlic. Mix black beans,
  ginger root, garlic.  Mix soy sauce, honey, hoisin sauce, and rice
  wine.
  
  COOKING:
  
  Heat oil in a large deep skillet or wok, and add ginger root and the
  scallion.  Stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the ribs and stir-fry for 5
  minutes. Add soy sauce mixture; stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the
  chicken broth. Stir ribs to coat them with the sauce and bring to a
  boil. Reduce heat to low. Cover, and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring

  :          dressed
  :          Salt and freshly ground
  :          pepper to taste
        2 TB crushed juniper berries
      1/4 c  pure olive oil
  :          Corn and Chili Sauce:
        4 oz slab bacon cut into 1/2-inch
  :          cubes
        1    onion, peeled and diced --
  :          (about 1/2 cup)
        3    ears fresh corn
        3 TB Chili Paste, -- recipe
  :          follows
        2 TB maple syrup
        2 TB red wine vinegar
        1 c  dry red wine
        1 TB ground cumin
        1 lg ripe tomato, -- seeded and
  :          diced
        1 c  Chicken Stock
  
  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F for 20 minutes. Season the squabs
  inside and out with the salt and pepper. Place the juniper berries
  into the cavities and brush the squabs with olive oil. Place
  breast-side down in a roasting pan and roast in the hot oven 20
  minutes for rare.
  
  Meanwhile, in a heavy-bottomed saucepan, over low heat, cook the cubed
  bacon until fully browned. Remove the bacon bits, leaving the bacon
  fat in the saucepan. Add the diced onion to the bacon fat and slowly
  saute until translucent.
  
  While the onion is cooking, cut the corn from the cob, and set the
  kernels aside. Cut or break the cobs to a size that will fit the
  saucepan, and add them to the cooking onions. The cobs will
  contribute a wonderful flavor to the finished sauce.
  
  Add the chili paste to the onion/corn cob mixture and cook 2 to 3
  minutes. Add the maple syrup, vinegar, and red wine, and reduce by
  half. Add the remaining ingredients, except the reserved corn
  kernels. Cook another 15 minutes, then remove the corn cobs and add
  the kernels. Cook 2 minutes longer, then remove from the heat and
  pour over the roasted squabs to serve.

  With a comal or black iron skillet over medium-high heat, cook the
  tomatoes until blackened all over. While still warm, pulse tomatoes
  with the garlic in a food processor until roughly chopped. Let cool
  to room temperature and add the remaining ingredients. Mix together
  and let sit at least 30 minutes before using.
  
  Mark Miller writes: "Ripe red tomatoes roasted on a hot steel comal
  until the skins blacken are a basic element of many Mexican salsas.
  The smoky flavor adds a complexity to the taste of ripe tomatoes.
  Mixing fresh mint as a counterpoint to this cooked flavor creates the
  combination of raw and cooked which is one of the classic taste
  motifs of Southwestern cuisine. This salsa goes particularly well
  with the wild Churro lamb that we serve at Coyote Cafe because it
  does not mask the Churro's unique taste. It can be served with
  venison chops, grilled pork, grilled marlin, and that faithful
  standby, tortilla chips."

      8    Garlic cloves -- peeled
      2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
           Salt and freshly ground
           Black pepper
      1    Basil sprig
      1    Oregano sprig
      1    Thyme sprig
      2 c  Knorr's vegetable stock --
           Fat skimmed
    1/2 c  Diced cucumber
    1/2 c  Diced yellow bell pepper
    1/2 c  Thinly sliced scallion
           Including green
    1/2 c  Diced red or yellow tomato
           BASIL PUREE
    1/2 c  Basil leaves -- packed
      1    Garlic clove
      2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
        pn Salt
 
  TO MAKE BASIL PUREE: Combine the ingredients in a food processor and
  process until smooth. YIELD: 1/4 CUP.
  
  TO MAKE GAZPACHO: Preheat oven to 450#161#F.
  
  Arrange the tomatoes, red bell peppers, onion, carrot and garlic in a
  large roasting pan. Drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with salt
  and pepper. Roast 30 minutes, stirring the vegetables and turning the
  pan so the vegetables brown evenly. Place the sprigs of basil,
  oregano and thyme on top of the vegetables and roast for 20 minutes
  more, or until the vegetables are very tender. Remove from the oven
  and cool slightly. Remove the carrot and set aside separately.
  
  Place a food mill over a large bowl. Transfer the roasted vegetables
  and all of the liquid in the pan to the food mill. Add about 1/2 cup
  of the broth to the pan and scrape up any brown bits. Add to the food
  mill. Press the vegetables through the food mill, using the remaining
  broth to keep thevegetables moist and to extract as much from the
  vegetables as possible. Discard the solids in the food mill. There
  should be about 5 cups of pureed vegetables and broth combined.
  
  Cut the carrot into small dice. Add the carrot, cucumber, yellow
  pepper, scallion and diced tomato to the puree. Taste and correct the
  seasonings. Refrigerate until very cold.
  
  Serve chilled in large shallow bowls. Garnish each with a swirl of
  Basil Puree.

  in olive oil over medium heat until translucent. Lower heat and add
  garlic. Saute briefly; do not brown.  Add pepper flakes, dried
  tomatoes, basil and oregano and stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes. Add
  mushrooms and stir-fry for 2 or 3 minutes more.  Add broiled tomatoes

  The editors wrote: "Many of our readers are drying their own
  tomatoes, and just a few bits of these rich, deep-flavored sun-dried
  nuggets can elevate a simple sauce to something truly special. This
  entry compounds that great fresh-tomato flavor by roasting the
  tomatoes first."

    1/2 lb Mozzarella Cut into 6 slices
           -Each 1/4-inch thick
      6    Rosemary sprigs
 
  Preheat oven to 450 F.and brush 2 baking sheets with some of the
  olive oil. Arrange as many vegetables as possible in one layer on
  sheets. Brush vegetables with some remaining oil and season with salt
  and pepper.  Roast in middle and lower thirds of oven, switching
  positions of sheets in oven halfway through roasting, until just
  tender and lightly browned, 10-15 min. Transfer vegetables as roasted
  to a tray, arranging them in one layer. Repeat with remaining
  vegetables.  Vegetables may be roasted 1 day ahead, cooled
  completely, and chilled, layered between sheets of plastic wrap on
  trays and covered. Bring to rooms temperature before proceeding. In a
  small bowl stir together ricotta, thyme, and salt and pepper to
  taste. Put 1 eggplant slice on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Spread 1
  Tablespoon ricotta mixture over eggplant. Cover ricotta mixture with
  2 potato slices and layer with 2 zucchini slices, 1 onion slice, 1
  mozzarella slice, 2-3 tomato slices, 2 zucchini slices, and 1 onion
  slice. Spread 1 Tablespoon ricotta mixture over onion and top with 1
  eggplant slice. Make 5 more Napoleons using remaining vegetables,
  ricotta mixture, and mozzarella. Insert a metal or wooden skewer
  through center of each Napoleon to make a hole from top to bottom.
  Trim rosemary sprigs to 1-inch taller than Napoleons and remove
  bottom leaves from each sprig, leaving about 1-inch of leaves around
  top. Insert 1 sprig into each Napoleon and bake in middle of oven for
  5 min, or until mozzarella is melted and vegetables are heated
  through. Serve with orzo.

 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1    Red pepper
      1    Tomato (red or yellow)
      1    Fennel bulb
      1 sm Onion, skin intact
    1/4 c  Olive oil
    1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
 
  Roasting the vegetables first gives an extra dimension to the flavors
  in this relish, and the crunchy, slightly licorice taste of the
  fennel is a pleasant surprise. From Leah Bergen.
  
  Roast all the vegetables in a 400 degree F. oven for 35 to 45 minutes.
  
  Remove the skin from the pepper, tomato and onion. Discard the pepper
  core and seeds; trim any tough outer leaves from the fennel, and trim
  the base.
  
  Dice vegetables into small relish-size bits and put in a clean glass
  jar. Cover with the vinegar and olive oil and refrig- erate. Will
  keep 7 to 10 days refrigerated.
  
  Uses: This delicious relish seems to go with everything from stuffed
  pasilla chiles to poached salmon and steamed Blue Lake beans.
  
  Makes 1 1/2 pints.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 tb Olive or vegetable oil
      1    Chicken cut up, or
      2    Chicken breasts, quartered
           -(and skinned if desired)
  7 1/2 oz Jar roasted red peppers,
           -or
      2    4-ounce jars sliced
           -pimientos
 
  On the last day of one mountain-cabin vacation I looked for dinner
  makings in the fridge and found a lone bottle of abandoned peppers
  (roasted sweet peppers, not hot chilies) and one cut-up chicken. With
  my favorite fast flourish of just putting two things together I
  browned the chicken, poured the peppers and their liquid (everything
  but the lid is my motto) into the frying pan, clapped the lid on,
  stuck the pan in the oven and waited 45 minutes. Delicious.
  
  Preheat oven to 375!F. Heat large, heavy oven-proof frying pan over
  medium-high heat, then add oil. Lightly brown chicken pieces on all
  sides. Pour peppers, with liquid, over chicken. Cover pan, transfer
  to oven and bake 45 minutes.
  
  Makes four servings.

  warm. Cook ravioli in boiling, salted water until tender, about 6
  minutes. Drain well. Toss ravioli with the Cream Sauce and grated
  Parmesan cheese until lightly coated.  Serve immediately with

  Hazelnuts Oven: Spread one pound shelled hazelnuts in a shallow pan
  and roast in a 275 degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes, until skins
  crack. To remove skins, rub warm nuts with a rough cloth or between
  your hands. Microwave:  Cook shelled hazelnuts for 3-4 minutes on

  power. Follow above instructions for removing skins.
     STORAGE: Hazelnuts can be stored at 32-35 degrees for up to 1 year

      Title: ROB WELLER'S HEALTHY CHICKEN FAJITAS
 Categories: Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------CHICKEN FILLING---------------------------
      1 lg Plump chicken breast
    1/2 c  Celery (tops and tender,
           -inside stalks)
    1/2 md White onion
      2    Or 3 peppercorns
      2 tb Olive oil
      1    Red pepper
      1    Yellow pepper
  1 1/2 lg Red onions
    1/2 c  Chopped cilantro leaves
           Salt to taste
           Pepper to taste

MMMMM------------------------BEAN FILLING-----------------------------
      1 lb Bag of pinto beans (red or
           -pink)
      8 c  Water
           Salt to taste
    1/4    Onion
    1/4 c  Olive oil
 
  Poach chicken with celery tops, onions and peppercorns. Cook for
  about 15 minutes.  Let cool and remove skin. When chicken is skinned,
  slice or shred, then saute with olive oil in wok or large skillet
  until barely browned around the edges.  Next add red and yellow
  peppers and red onions. Toss and saute for about 10 minutes. Watch
  closely so that peppers don't go limp.  Add cilantro leaves. Remove
  from heat.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Combine with beans (see
  below). Place in tortillas, top with salsa and serve.
  
  Cook beans in water for approximately 1 1/2 hours on medium heat.
  
  Make sure that beans are completely covered in water. Stir
  occasionally. Beans will absorb liquid and become soft. Add more
  water if needed. Add salt when beans are thoroughly cooked. Remove
  from heat. Add chopped onion. (Onions will cook from the heat of the
  beans.) Drizzle with olive oil. Let sit.
  
  TORTILLAS: Warm six large flour tortillas in microwave on high (in
  large zip lock bag to preserve moisture) for about 30 seconds.
  
  SALSA: Two large, peeled and chopped tomatoes.
  
  Serves 4.

      1 tb Cumin
      1 ts Cayenne (or to your taste)
      1 pk Frozen corn
      2 cn Black beans (or any other
           -kind of beans you like
           -chickpeas work well, too)
 11 1/2 c  Picante sauce (Shotgun
           -Willie's green sauce very
           -hot works well)
           -salt to taste
           -grated cheddar, if
           -desired
           -cashew nuts, if desired
 
  Saute onions in the olive oil.  (I used cooking wine instead to cut
  out the fat).  Add garlic a bit later. After onion and garlic are
  have turned golden brown, add cumin, cayenne, and whatever other
  spices you might like. Fry for a couple of minutes.
  
  Next, add the peppers, saute them for a few minutes. Put the crushed
  tomatoes, corn, beans and picante sauce into the crock pot, and add
  the onion mixture. Cook on low about 10 hours.
  
  Serve with grated cheddar and cashew nuts, if desired.
  
  Note: I didn't have room in my crockpot for 2 cans of crushed
  tomatoes, and I had to cut back a little on the corn too, so you will
  have to vary the sizes above depending on the size of your crockpot.

  2 1/2 lb New potatoes, scrubbed
  1 1/2 lb Green beans
    1/3 c  Herb vinegar
    1/3 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
    1/3 c  Vegetable oil
      2 tb Granulated sugar
      1 ts Paprika

      1 c  Walnut pieces
      1    Medium sweet red pepper
      6    Scallions (half green tops)
      1    Bunch parsley
    1/2 ts Black pepper, or to taste
 
  To prepare dressing, in blender container combine herb vinegar, olive
  oil, vegetable oil, granulated sugar, paprika, salt, garlic, dry
  mustard, caraway seeds, and celery seeds. Blend until well
  emulsified.
  Cut green beans on the diagonal in 1-1/2-inch pieces and cook in a
  large pot of boiling water until just tender-crisp. Refresh in cold
  water, drain and pat dry.
  Cook the potatoes in a large pot of boiling water until just tender
  when pierced with aknife, 12-15 minutes. Drain and pat dry. Allow the
  potatoes to cool slightly. Slice potatoes into 1/4-inch thick slices,
  drizzling a small amount of dressing over potato slices and tossing
  to coat as you slice.
  Add green beans to potato slices and toss to combine, drizzling a
  small amount of dressing to coat.
  Dice red pepper, chop scallions and parsley, and add with remaining
  ingredients and toss to combine, drizzling just enough additional
  dressing to evenly coat salad. Grind black pepper over salad to taste
  and lightly toss again. Taste and adjust seasonings.
  Salad is best if eaten the same day it is made - slightly warm or at
  room temperature - do not refrigerate! Leftovers should be
  refrigerated, but may be warmed slightly in the microwave before
  serving.
  NOTE: I use Soleillou Radiant Wine Herb Vinegar which contains white
  wine vinegar, cloves, thyme, rosemary, fennel, bay laurel leaves,
  basil, and marjoram. This is available from Balducci's, New York
  City.
  A reasonable substitute could probably be made by steeping these
  herbs in white wine vinegar for a few weeks before using.

 Categories: Pies, Desserts, Fruits
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
  2 2/3 c  Pastry flour
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/4 c  Vegetable shortening
           Ice water - 8 to 12 tbs

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      2    (1 lb.) cans pitted tart red
           - cherries (water pack)
    1/3 c  Liquid from cherries
      3 tb Quick-cooking tapioca
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Almond extract
      1 ts Lemon juice
    1/2 ts Red food coloring
  1 1/4 c  Sugar
    1/8 ts Ground cinnamon
   1/16 ts Ground cloves
      2 tb Butter or margarine
 
  (DIRECTIONS FOR PASTRY) Combine flour and salt in large mixing bowl.
  Cut shortening into flour mixture, using pastry blender, until mixture
  resembles coarse crumbs with a few pea-size pieces. Sprinkle 4
  tablespoons ice water over mixture and toss mixture with two forks.
  Sprinkle another 4 tablespoons ice water over mixture and toss
  mixture again. If mixture can be pressed together to form a solid
  mass do not add additional water. If mixture is still crumbly, add
  additional ice water 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing mixture with
  forks, until a mass can be formed. Divide mixture and form 2 balls of
  dough, one slightly larger than the other. Press the larger ball of
  dough into a disk and roll between sheets of waxed paper until
  1/8-inch thick. Line deep 9-inch pyrex pie plate with pastry and trim
  edges to 3/4-inch beyond edge of plate.  Set aside. Press remaining
  ball of dough into a disk and roll between sheets of waxed paper
  until 1/8-inch thick. Set aside. (DIRECTIONS FOR FILLING) Drain
  cherries. Measure 1/3 cup liquid into mixing bowl. Discard remaining
  liquid. Add tapioca, salt, almond extract, lemon juice and food
  coloring, then cherries. Combine 1 cup sugar, cinnamon and cloves.
  Pour sugar mixture over cherries. Mix and let stand at least 15
  minutes. Fill pastry with cherry mixture. Dot with butter. Sprinkle
  with remaining sugar. Moisten rim with water. Fit top pastry over
  filling. Turn top edge over bottom edge and press firmly together,
  creating fluted edge. Cut vents in top to allow steam to escape and
  juices to bubble. Bake at 425 degrees for 15 minutes. Reduce
  temperature to 375 degrees and continue baking for 35-45 minutes, or
  until filling is bubbling and crust is golden brown. If edge of crust
  appears to be browning too quickly, cover lightly with aluminum foil.
  Cool pie thoroughly on wire rack. Note:  The spice flavor is quite
  subtle, but very effective when combined with the lemon juice and
  almond extract. Try these modest amounts first (I prefer them), or
  increase them to suit

      1 tb Double-acting baking powder
      2    Sticks unsalted butter, soft
      2 c  Granulated sugar
      4    Eggs, large
      1 c  Milk
      1 ts Pure vanilla extract

MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE ICING----------------------------
     10 tb Unsalted butter
  1 1/4 c  Firmly packed dark brown
           Sugar
    1/4 c  Plus
      2 tb Milk
  1 1/4 ts Pure vanilla extract
      3 c  Sifted confectioners' sugar
 
     Make the cake layers:  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2
  buttered 9-inch round cake pans with rounds of wax paper, butter the
  paper, and dust the pans with flour, knocking out the excess. Onto a
  sheet of wax paper sift twice the flour and the baking powder. In a
  bowl with an electric mixer cream the butter with the sugar until the
  mixture is light and fluffy and beat in the egg yolks, 1 at a time,
  beating well after each addition.  Add the flour mixture to the
  butter mixture in batches alternately with the milk, beginning and
  ending with the flour mixture, and beat in the vanilla.  In another
  bowl beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they just hold
  stiff peaks, stir one third of them into the batter to lighten it,
  and fold in the remaining whites gently but thoroughly.  Divide the
  batter between the prepared pans, smoothing the tops, and bake the
  layers in the middle of the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a
  tester comes out clean. Let the cake layers cool in the pans on racks
  for 10 minutes and turn them out onto the racks. Discard the wax
  paper and let the layers cool completely.
     Make the icing:  In a small saucepan melt the butter over moderate
  heat, add the brown sugar, and bring the mixture to a boil. Add the
  milk in a stream, whisking, and bring the mixture to a boil. Remove
  the pan from the heat and let the mixture cool completely. In the
  bowl of an electric mixer beat together the brown sugar mixture and
  the vanilla. Add the confectioners' sugar in batches, beating, and
  beat the icing until it is light and fluffy.
     Assemble the cake:  On a cake plate arrange 1 of the cake layers,
  spread the layer with one third of the icing, and top the icing with
  the remaining layer. Spread the top and side of the cake with the
  remaining icing.

  about 5 minutes.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375F. Pour the gravy over the mixture in the
  skillet & stir. Pour into the pie shell. Roll out top dough & place
  on pie. Bake for 30 minutes or until crust is lightly browned.
  
  VARIATION: Pour vegetable mixture into an uncovered casserole dish &
  top with crushed cornflakes. Bake for

  enough to catch any leaking syrup. Dissolve sugar in water and cook
  without stirring to about hard ball stage (247-252 degrees). Pour
  syrup into laced pan. It should reach a level about 3/4" above the
  strings. Cover the surface with a piece of foil. Watch and wait. The
  syrup sometimes takes a week to crystallize. Lift out the laced pan.
  Cut the strings and dislodge the rock candy. Rinse quickly in cold

 Categories: Candy
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Rock candy is easy!  You
           Don't really need a 'recipe'
           Here's how you do
           It ..
 
  Take about a cup of water (or more, if you want to make several
  pieces of candy), and heat it in a saucepan until it almost boils.
  Turn off the heat. Start stirring in granulated sugar, making sure
  that each addition is *completely dissolved* before you add more. You
  are aiming for a 'supersaturation solution' of sugar in the water.
  
  When you can no longer add sugar to the solution, it is ready. Let it
  cool a bit, and then pour it into a tall, narrow jar (or jars).
  Suspend a clean piece of cotton string into the center of the syrup.
  Tying the top end of the string to a pencil that sits on the rim of
  the jar works well. Cover the solution loosely so that dust or other
  contaminants will not float into the sugar solution, and put the
  whole thing into an out-of-the-way place for two to three weeks.
  Don't shake or disturb it.
  
  During that time, larger than normal sugar crystals will form on the
  cotton string and possibly in the bottom of the jar. When the
  crystals have stopped growing or are as big as you like them, take
  the string out, briefly rinse the crystals in clear water and hang
  them to dry for a few minutes.  Rock candy!
  
  You can also add food coloring to the sugar solution. The crystals
  will pick up a tint on the tips from it, and it looks kind of neat.

 Categories: Children, Kooknet, Cyberealm
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           2 c granulated sugar
           Heavy cord
           1 c water
 
  The book says to put one cup of water into a small saucepan, pour 2
  cups of granulated sugar into the water, heat the water and sugar on
  the stove over a medium heat, continue stirring until the sugar
  melts, keep adding sugar and stirring until it melts, stop adding
  sugar when you see that it will no longer dissolve in the water (that
  is until you see sugar lying on the bottom of the saucepan). Remove
  the pot from the stove, let the liquid cool until it is just warm.
  Pour the liquid into a clean glass jar. Tie one end of a piece of
  heavy cord around the middle of a pencil. Place the pencil over the
  top of the glass jar letting the cord fall into the liquid. Crystals
  will begin to form in a few hours. The next day, remove the cord from
  the jar, pour the sugar liquid back into the saucepan, reheat and
  cool it just as you did before. Pour the liquid back into the jar and
  reinsert the cord with the crystals into it. More crystals will form.
  If you repeat this procedure every day the crystal candy will grow
  bigger and bigger. When it has reached a size that pleases you, snip
  off any excess string and enjoy.

      2    Boned game hens
      1    Recipe stuffing
      1    Recipe veloute sauce
      3    Pork link sausages
      4    Bacon strips
      1    Clay pot
      1    Recipe clay
 
  *This recipe, to be baked in a clay pot, is made in several stages. In
  fact, the game hen can be deboned the day before it is cooked. Use the
  bones for stock, as dirested and prepare the stuffing for the hens
  the day they are to be cooked.  Make the clay for sealing before
  stuffing the hens.
  
  DEBONING THE GAME HEN: Using a sharp boning knife, split the hen from
  the
  
  buttuckes to the neck. The deboining is easier if the hen is split on
  one
  
  side of the backbone, not down the middle. Lay the hen flat on the
  board to expose the backbone and rib cage. Pull out the cartiledge in
  center. Carefully pull the rib cage out, working the knife between
  the rib and the flesh.  Also remove the wishbone. Do not remove bone
  from the wings or thighs or legs. Wash and dry hens and refrigerate,
  covered, until ready to use.
  
  GAME HEN STOCK: Press the onion, cut side down, on a hot surface
  until well browned, Place onion and bones in baking pan and bake at
  350 degrees F for 20 minutes.    Combine celery, water, bouillon, and
  baked bones in a saucepot.  Boil, uncovered, to reduce liquid to 1/2.
  Set aside.
  
  VELOUTE SAUCE: Heat butter in small saucepan and blend in flour. Stir
  in stock gradually.  Cook and stir with a whisk until thickened and
  smooth. Ass remaining ingredients, Set aside.
  
  STUFFING FOR GAME HENS: Put bread slices in blender or food processor
  with steel blade and process to make medium crumbs.  Set aside.
  Remove skins from the sausage and crumble. Fry in a skillet until
  browned. Add celery and onions and continue cooking until celery and
  onions are tender. Add bread crumbs and remaining ingredients and mix
  throughly. Set aside.
  
  CLAY FOR SEALING POTS: Mix dry ingredients. Mix food colouring with
  ater.
  
  gradually stir into the flour mixture until it reaches the
  consistancy of a biscuit batter. Mix well and set aside.
  
  TO ASSEMBLE THE DISH: Spread hens out flat, sink sides down. Divide
  stuffing between hens, shaping stuffing into balls. Bring hens up
  around the stuffing and shape into a ball. Heat Veloute Sauce and
  pour into the clay pot. Lay hens, breast side up, into Veloute Sauce.
  Cut each sausage into 3 pieces and place around hens. Cover and seal
  edges of pot with clay. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 1 hour.

      Title: ROCK CORNISH GAME HEN HISTORY
 Categories: Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Information
 
  I drew a blank on the subject until I remembered that I'd always
  heard of them referred to as Rock Cornish Game Hens rather than just
  Cornish Game Hens.  That's when I finally hit pay dirt.
  
  The following is from a book by the brothers Lobel all about meat and
  poultry.
  
  These delectable little birds were actually "invented". It took a
  printer of exceptional engravings++with a taste for fine art and fine
  food++to dream up the idea.  Jacques Makowsky and his wife, Therese,
  came to America via Russia and France. He practiced his art in New
  York City for eight years and then retired to a farm in Pomfret
  County, Connecticut. The wild beauty of his surroundings++plus his
  idleness++ caused him to call his farm Idle Wild. He decided to
  become a poultry farmer, but only of gourmet birds.  He first raised
  Guineas, but later he and his wife, after much experimenting, came up
  with a crossbreed of Cornish game cocks and Plymouth Rock hens. The
  result was a plump little bird with all-white meat.
  
  The first Rock Cornish game hen made its debut in 1950. Now they sell
  in the millions and are shipped all over the country to gourmet
  restaurants and fine butcher shops. Aside from the succulence of its
  white meat, it has a distinct gamy flavor.  This is because the birds
  are given a high protein diet that includes such native Connecticut
  produce as cranberries, acorns, and other nuts.  It is sometimes
  compared in appearance and taste with the less available quail and
  squab.
  
  The usual weight is 1 pound, which is ample for an individual
  serving. In fact, half a bird is adequate for home parties++if the
  rest of the menu is abundant.

      Title: ROCK CORNISH GAME HENS WITH HERB & SHALLOT
 Categories: Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Rock Cornish game hens
           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper
      1 ts Rosemary
      1 ts Thyme
      2 tb Chopped parsley
    1/4 lb Butter
      5    Shallots (minced)
 
  Merle Ellis doesn't provide any more detail on the origins of the game
  hens, but he does note that "These delicious little birds didn't even
  exist back in the days when Grandma was a girl. Their ancestors did,
  the Plymouth Rock hen and the Cornish game cock, but they hadn't
  gotten together yet in those days.  That event didn't happen till
  around 1950 and since then Rock Cornish Game Hens have become almost
  commonplace."
  
  Ah but all may not be as it seems at the old poultry counter! While
  discussing the classification of poultry, Ellis states "Young
  chickens may be labeled young chicken, broiler, roaster, fryer capon
  or Rock Cornish game hen".  So I guess you pays yer money and takes
  your chances. Whatever it is that's hanging out around the poultry
  bins in Safeway under the guise of Rock Cornish game hens, they're
  good!
  
  Preheat oven to 350F.  Cut each hen in half, sprinkle all over with
  salt and pepper, and bring to room temperature. Melt butter in small
  fry pan and add shallots, rosemary and thyme. Stir well and let
  bubble for about 5 minutes, then remove from heat. Place hens in flat
  baking pan, skin side up, and baste with the butter sauce. bake for
  50 minutes, basting every 15 minutes.  Garnish with parsley.
  
  Serve with wild rice, leaf spinach, and a rose wine.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: ROCK CORNISH GAME HENS WITH HERB & SHALLOT BU
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Rock Cornish game hens
           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper
      1 ts Rosemary
      1 ts Thyme
      2 tb Chopped parsley
    1/4 lb Butter
      5    Shallots (minced)
 
  Merle Ellis doesn't provide any more detail on the origins of the game
  hens, but he does note that "These delicious little birds didn't even
  exist back in the days when Grandma was a girl. Their ancestors did,
  the Plymouth Rock hen and the Cornish game cock, but they hadn't
  gotten together yet in those days.  That event didn't happen till
  around 1950 and since then Rock Cornish Game Hens have become almost
  commonplace."
  
  Ah but all may not be as it seems at the old poultry counter! While
  discussing the classification of poultry, Ellis states "Young
  chickens may be labeled young chicken, broiler, roaster, fryer capon
  or Rock Cornish game hen".  So I guess you pays yer money and takes
  your chances. Whatever it is that's hanging out around the poultry
  bins in Safeway under the guise of Rock Cornish game hens, they're
  good!
  
  Preheat oven to 350F.  Cut each hen in half, sprinkle all over with
  salt and pepper, and bring to room temperature. Melt butter in small
  fry pan and add shallots, rosemary and thyme. Stir well and let
  bubble for about 5 minutes, then remove from heat. Place hens in flat
  baking pan, skin side up, and baste with the butter sauce. bake for
  50 minutes, basting every 15 minutes.  Garnish with parsley.
  
  Serve with wild rice, leaf spinach, and a rose wine.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: ROCK SHRIMP TAMALES WITH FOUR-PEPPER CREAM
 Categories: Shrimp, Southwest
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           For The Tamales--
      8 lg Dried Corn Husks*see
           Notes
           Masa Dough--
    1/4 c  Unsalted Butter softened
      2 c  Masa Harina
      1 ts Baking Powder
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Minced Chipotle In Adobo
    1/4 c  Canola Oil
      1 c  Hot Chicken Or Shellfish
           Stock
           For The Filling--
      2 sl Bacon -- finely diced
      2 tb Red Bell Pepper -- minced
      2 tb Green Bell Pepper- minced
      2 tb Yellow Bell Pepper --
           Minced
      2 tb Red Onion -- minced
      1 ts Garlic -- minced
    1/2 c  Chicken Or Shellfish Stock
    1/2 ts Adobo Sauce From Canned
           Chipotles Above
      8 oz Coarsely Chopped Rock Shrimp
           More if needed
      1 tb Chopped Fresh Cilantro
           Four Pepper Cream (Recipe
           Follows)
           Garnish--
           Cilantro Sprigs
           Diced Bell Peppers
 
  TO MAKE THE TAMALES: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the
  paddle attachment, or by hand with a wooden spoon, beat the butter
  until light and fluffy. Add the masa harina, baking powder, salt and
  chipotle. Mix until well-blended. With the motor running, slowly add
  the canola oil and the hot stock. Continue mixing until you hear a
  slapping sound, approximately 2 minutes. The dough will be soft. Set
  aside. You can do this all by hand with a wooden spatula,but it will
  take some energy! TO MAKE THE FILLING: In a large saute pan over
  medium heat, saute the bacon until translucent. Add the peppers,
  onion and garlic and saute slowly until tender, approximately 3
  minutes. Add the stock, shrimp and adobo sauce. Cook, stirring, until
  the shrimp are barely cooked through, approximately 1 minute. Remove
  from the heat, strain, set the solids aside, and return the liquid to
  pan. Over high heat, reduce the liquid until syrupy and add to the
  shrimp mixture. Add the cilantro and stir to combine. TO ASSEMBLE THE
  DISH: Remove the husks from the water, drain, and pat dry. Spread out
  the corn husks on a dry work surface. Pinch off an egg-size piece of
  the masa
  
  mixture. Pat it into the corn husk, flattening the dough to
  approximately 4 inches square and 1/4-inch thick, leaving a border of
  husk at least 1/2-inch wide around the perimeter of the dough. Spread
  a tablespoon of the filling lengthwise in the center of the dough.
  Fold the husk together until the edges overlap and the masa and its
  filling are completely enclosed by the husk. Gently flatten the top
  and bottom of the husk and fold the ends up to enclose. Repeat with
  the other 7 husks. Place folded side down in a steamer over boiling
  water and steam, covered, for 45 minutes. TO SERVE: Open the husks to
  reveal the tamales and place on a warm plate. Spoon the Four-Pepper
  Cream over the tamales and garnish with cilantro sprigs and diced
  peppers. Serve immediately. Yield: 4 servings FOUR-PEPPER CREAM 1
  tablespoon olive oil 3/4 cup minced shallots 2 teaspoons seeded and
  chopped serrano chiles 1 cup dry white wine 2 1/2 cups rich shrimp or
  chicken stock 3/4 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons finely diced red bell
  pepper 2 tablespoons finely diced yellow bell pepper 2 tablespoons
  finely diced green bell pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground white
  pepper Drops of fresh lemon or lime juice In a medium saute pan, heat
  the olive oil and saute the shallots and serranos until soft but not
  brown. Add the wine and stock and bring to a boil. Continue to boil
  until the mixture is reduced by half. Add the cream and continue to
  boil until the mixture is reduced to a light sauce consistency. Stir
  in the diced bell peppers and season to taste with salt, pepper and
  drops of lemon juice. Serve warm. (Four-Pepper Cream can be made up
  to a day ahead, stored in the refrigerator, and reheated gently in a
  water bath.) Copyright, 1996, TV FOOD NETWORK, G.P., All Rights

      Title: ROESTI (SWISS-STYLE POTATO CAKE)
 Categories: Swiss, Main dish, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 3/4 lb Potatoes (see below)
      3 oz Butter, lard or bacon fat
  1 1/2 tb Water or milk
 
  This is a favorite dish of German-speaking Switzerland. Besides being
  served as a side dish with meat or fish, it is sometimes eaten on its
  own, for lunch or even breakfast, with milky coffee.
  
  The potatoes should be boiled in their jackets the day before. These
  should be waxy potatoes of the potato-salad kind. The next day, peel
  them and grate them on the coarsest blade of the grater. Heat a large
  heavy frying pan, and let the fat get hot: then put in the potatoes,
  sprinkle with salt, and fry, turning them constantly. When they have
  soaked up the butter or whatever, add more. Now form a "cake" by
  pushing the potatoes from the edges of the pan into the middle and
  flattening down the top. Sprinkle with the water or milk, reduce
  heat, and cover with a lid or inverted dish. Shake the covered pan
  occasionally to keep the potatoes from burning, and leave on low heat
  for at least 15 minutes. The potatoes must stick together, but not to
  the bottom of the pan. When cooked, turn the cake out onto a plate,
  bottom side up, and serve. (Or alternately, brown the other side as
  well.) . Variations: (1) Saute 2 T chopped onions in the fat before
  adding thte potatoes. Don't let them brown. Also note that in this
  version, the potatoes will need less fat. (2) Saute 2 - 3 1/2 oz.
  diced bacon before adding potatoes. You won't need any extra salt.
  (3) Sprinkle cooked potatoes with grated cheese before serving, and
  heat it briefly in the oven to melt it.

 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    1" cubes of ginger chopped
      8    Cloves of garlic
  1 1/2 c  Beef broth
     10 tb Vegetable oil
      2 lb Lamb or beef stew meat
     10    Whole black cardamoms
      2    Bay leaves
      6    Whole cloves
     10    Whole peppercorns
      1    1" stick cinnamon
      2    Medium onions
      1 ts Ground coriander
      2 ts Ground black cumin
      4 ts Red paprika
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
  1 1/4 ts Salt
      6 tb Plain yogurt
    1/4 ts Garam masala
           Black pepper
 
  Put the ginger,  garlic, and 4 tablespoons water in blender. Blend
  well until you have a smooth paste. Heat the oil in a wok to medium
  high heat. Brown the meat cubes in several batches and set to one
  side. Put the cardamom,  bay  leaves, cloves, peppercorns, and
  cinnamon into the same hot oil.
   Stir once and wait  until the cloves swell and the bay leaves begin
  to take on  color. Now  put in the onions. Stir and fry for about 5
  minutes or until the onions turn a medium brown color. Put in the
  ginger garlic paste and stir for 30 seconds.   Add the fried meat
  cubes and juices. Stir for 30 seconds.
    Now put in 1/6 of the yoghurt.   Stir and fry for 30 seconds or
  until the yoghurt is well  blended.
    Add  the  remaining yoghurt,  a  tablespoon at a time, in the same
  way. Stir and fry  for another 3-4 minutes. Now add the rest of the
  broth (a little more for beef than lamb). Bring the contents of the
  pot to a boil, scraping in all browned spices on the sides and bottom
  of the pot. Cover, turn heat to low and simmer for about an hour if
  lamb and two if beef. Every 10 minutes or so, give the meat a good
  stir. When the meat is tender, take off the lid, turn the heat up to
  medium and boil away some of the liquid.   You should end up with a
  tender meat in a thick, reddish brown sauce.   All the fat  that
  collects in the pot may be spooned off the top.
    Sprinkle  the  garam masala and black pepper over the meat before
  you serve and mix them in.

 Categories: Candies, Ethnic
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 qt Grape juice
      3 c  Flour
      3 c  Sugar
      1 c  Cornstarch
    3/4 c  Corn syrup
           Walnut halves
 
  First, string the walnut halves on thread. Using medium to heavy
  cotton thread, cut thread to about 24 inches long. With a thin
  needle, carefully pass the thread through the walnut halves, leaving
  some extra string exposed on either end. Knot both ends of the string.
  
  Blend flour, sugar, cornstarch and corn syrup. Add juice and mix until
  smooth. Pour half of the mixture into a large, heavy saucepan, bring
  to a boil and boil, stirring constantly, until mixture is thick.
  Remove from heat.
  
  Dip one string of walnuts at a time into the hot grape juice mixture
  several times, and let the excess coating drip into the pan. Transfer
  the walnuts to a drying rack - you can rig up a rack by propping a
  broom handle between two chairs; place a pan and newspapers
  underneath to catch the drips - and dry overnight. Reserve leftover
  cooked grape mixture.
  
  The next day, cook the remaining grape mixture. Pass the remaining
  mixture through a sieve and add to the grape mixture in the pan. Dip
  the walnuts several more times in the hot grape mixture. Hang to dry
  several days in a dark, cool place. To store or serve, remove walnuts
  from the string and rll rogig in powdered sugar. Store in a covered
  jar or tin.
  
  NOTE: White grape juice or other fruit juices such as pear or apple
  can be used.

      1 tb Oregano; (mexican)
      1    Bay leaf
 
  Recipe by: Wayne Preston Allen * arbol, finger-hots, pequins, or thai
  peppers
  
  This chili is in the style of New Mexico green chile stew.
  
  Remove stems from red peppers and chop into parts to separate out the
  seeds and expose interiors. Cover with boiling water and let sit for
  an hour. Blend into smooth sauce with blender. Don't get this stuff
  in your eyes! Better yet, wear protective clothing during handling
  (I'm only half joking!).
  
  Brown the roast as if making pot roast - coat meat with flour and
  brown every surface in olive oil. (Theresa says I can do this almost
  as well as her Aunt Tia, the Goddess of Pot Roast - but she's just
  being kind.) Add chicken broth and water up to one inch deep and
  cover. Simmer meat by itself for one hour over low heat.
  
  Lightly blend the tomatillos and three green chilies in blender. Dice
  the remaining green chilies, garlic, onion, and tomatoes. Add the
  sauces, vegetables, and spices to the pot with enough water to cover.
  When the meat is falling-apart-tender (several more hours,
  typically), use two forks to shred it into small chunks.
  
  Serve topped with slices of avacado and white cheese, along with
  sides of beans and jalapeno cornbread.
  
  Alternate Version - Instead of a beef roast, use buffalo! I tried this
  recipe with ground buffalo ("100% American Bison!"), and was mighty
  surprised and pleased. I found this meat and a few other exotics at
  Whole Foods Grocery, a health food store in Austin. I'll continue to
  experiment and report the results.

      Title: ROLLED BUTTERY LEMON COOKIES (MAILANDERLI)
 Categories: Cookies, Swedish
      Yield: 50 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Butter, slightly softened (1
           -stick)
    2/3 c  Granulated sugar, plus more
           -for garnishing
      1 lg Egg
           Finely grated peel (yellow
           -part only) of 1 large
           Lemon
  1 3/4 c  All-purpose or unbleached
           -white flour
      1 lg Egg yolk beaten with 1
           -tablespoon water
           For glazing cookies.
 
  Grease several baking sheets and set aside.  With a mixer at medium
  speed, beat the butter in a large mixer bowl until light and fluffy.
  Beat in the sugar until well blended and smooth. Beat in the egg and
  lemon peel. With the mixer at low speed, beat in the flour just until
  evenly incorporated.
  
  Divide the dough in half.  Place each portion between large sheets of
  waxed paper.  Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough to a scant 1/4
  inch thick. Check the undersides and smooth out any wrinkles in the
  waxed paper. Stack the rolled portions on a tray or baking sheet.
  Refrigerate for about 20 minutes or until cold and firm, but not hard.
  
  Heat the oven to 375F.  Working with one chilled portion of dough at
  a time (keep the other one chilled), peel away a layer of waxed
  paper. (This makes it easier to lift the cookies from the paper
  later.) Replace the paper and turn the dough over. Peel of the second
  layer of paper. Using a 2-inch round or scalloped cutter (or a small
  juice of sherry glass) cut out the cookies.  Use a spatula to
  carefully lift the cookies from the paper and place them about 1 inch
  apart on the baking sheets. Reroll the dough scraps between waxed
  paper; rechill in the refrigerator. Repeat the process with the
  second portion of dough.
  
  Working with a few cookies at a time, brush the tops with the egg
  yolk-water mixture using a pastry brush or paper towel. Sprinkle the
  tops lightly with granulated sugar. Repeat until all of the cookies
  are garnished.
  
  Bake the cookies for 6 to 9 minutes or until the top is just tinged
  with brown and slightly darker at the edges. Let cool on the baking
  sheets for about 2 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and let stand
  until thoroughly cool.  Store airtight for up to a week. Freeze for
  longer storage.
  
  Makes 50 to 60 cookies.

  1 1/4 c  Warm water
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      4 c  Bread flour
      1 ts Salt
           Chopped fresh rosemary,
           -tarragon and oregano
           For the filling
      2 oz Pesto
    1/4 lb Ham, thinly sliced
    1/4 lb Provolone cheese, sliced
    1/8 lb Coppacola (spicy italian
           -ham) thinly sliced
      2    Sweet red peppers, roasted,
           -peeled and sliced

           -chopped (6 - 8)
      1    Egg
      1    Egg white
           Cornmeal
 
  Servings: 4 - 6 as a sandwich
  
  QUAN    MEAS    ING **
  
  For the Pizza Dough
  
  *DIRECTIONS*
  
  Soften the yeast in the water. Stir in the oil, then the flour and
  salt. Knead dough on a floured board until smooth and elastic (about
  20 minutes). Shape into a round ball, cover with plastic and
  refrigerate
        1    hourl
  
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Shape the pizza dough into a ball and
  then roll out into a large oval shape (about 24 inches long). About 2
  inches behind the front edge, spread the pesto in a long stripe,
  stopping just short of the ends.
  
  Just behind and overlapping the pesto, place a layer of the ham
  slices, then a layer of cheese then the coppacolla, peppers and
  pepperoncinis. You should still have about 2 inches of dough showing
  at the back edge.
  
  Beat the egg and brush on the back edge and ends of the dough.
  
  Roll up Calzone as firmly as possible (so no air gets inside). Tuck
  the ends in and finish with the back edge on the bottom, not on the
  side.
  
  Place on a baking sheet pan sprinkled with corn meal, brush with egg
  white and bake in a 400 degree oven for
       20    minutes.
  
  Cool to room temperature and slice.  Can be sliced thin for appetizers
  
  NOTE: To roast peppers, preheat broiler.  Slice the peppers in half
  lengthwise. Core them and remove the seeds and ribs. Lay the pieces
  skin side up on a flat broiling pan and place the pan 3 - 4 inches
  below the heat.  Broil the peppers until the skins are charred (they
  should be black).  Then place the peppers in a plastic bag, seal it
  with a twist tie and set aside. Let peppers steam in the bag for 15
  minutes. Remove the peppers from the bag and slip off the charred
  skins.

  sieve> w/cornstarch/conf.sugar mixture. 2. Prepare cake:
     Bake cake & place on 2 STURDY! foil-wrapped card boards the size
  of the cake. <Have fancy STURDY! tray ready that is 3-4" larger than
  cake.> "Cur tains" break if c.board flexes!
     A solid cake should be used, such as FRUIT, CARROT or POUND cake
  should be used. Torte as usual. Set aside to cool several hours. I
  have used reg. cake.
     Fill in any holes or uneven places with butter- cream icing so
  cake is nice & smooth. 3. With your hands, rub something sticky on
  the cake <for rolled icing to stick to>. I use *apricot filling -the
  kind baker's use. You can use piping gel for fake cakes. * Coat the
  cake <just> before making the icing. You wouldn't want this to dry
  over. 4. Put 1 rounded ts Knox Gelatin in a glass measuring cup; add
  cold water to equal 1/4 cup. Stir until gelatin is dissolved.

 Categories: Icings
      Yield: 37 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------HINTS--------------------------------
 
  12. TO DECORATE: Use royal icing only - on rolled f.
   Use wax paper to make template patterns. All pat terns should be
  even & line up. I use calculator paper for making patterns for sides
  of cake. You can accordion-fold it & cut scallops, etc. Place pattern
  against cake & mark with sharp object. Modes of decoration for Rolled
  Fondant cakes include: ~Lace pieces <trace patter w/#00 tip> ~RIBBON
  INSERTION <pieces of ribbon inserted to appear to be lacing in & out
  of cake.> ~"CURTAINS" #00 tip <w/smaller tip, less line break!>
  First, build out "bridge" of scallops at base by over- piping #13,
  then #4,3,& 2. To pipe curtains; start at top <on your marked
  pattern,> drape to bottom & slightly under edge of icing "bridge."
  Curtains should be close <no wider than width of icing drape
  between.> Finish w/#1 tiny "bubble" at top & base of curtains.
  ~CRIMPERS: use fancy crimpers to press fancy patterns into icing.
  ~EMBROIDERY: DONE W/#0 to #1 tips. Its like figure- piping. Draw tiny
  stems/leaves/flowers onto the cake.
   Easy - can wipe off any mistakes. ~LEATHER TOOLS/OTHER PRESSES: Use
  these to press pat terns into cake. Hearts, flowers & many other
  patterns are available. Tandy leather tools avail. at leather shops.
  ~DO IMMEDIATELY: ribbon insertion, pattern pressing & crimping. ~When
  using GRAYSLAKE gelatin, increase gelatin to 1 1/2 tb. ~If ingred.
  get to hot, it may take more confect. sugar ~If gel or filling gets
  on icing, use a bit of corn starch/confect.sugar mixture to rub off
  the shine. ~Too cold a room can cool icing off too quickly. NO AIR
  SHOULD EVER BLOW DIRECTLY ON THE ICING. ~LEFTOVER ICING: Can be
  rolled out & cut with cookie cutters, etc., dry & use on other cakes.
  *We use a "bib" cutter to make bibs, also booties, hearts, stand-up
  characters, all sorts of things. ~Keeps indefinitely sealed &
  refrigerated. ~Use for candy center; add flavors/color/nuts, etc..Can
  add butter to thin. Dip in dipping chocolate. ~Make candy "rocks":

  5. Set the glass measuring cup in a pan with 1" of very hot water in
  it. Add into the cup: Glucose <to=3/4 cup in all>, Crisco & glucose.
  Stir w/<wooden> spoon <just barely> until Crisco is dis solved. DO
  NOT GET THIS MIXTURE MORE THAN WARM! 6. If adding flavor/color, do
  this now. 7. Pour the cup of warm ingredients into the "well" of
  conf.sugar. Stir w/wooden spoon until too thick.
   Pour mixture out onto the cornstarch/conf.sugar, knead w/hands &
  incorporate as much conf.sugar from pinch the dough. It shouldn't feel
  sticky. 8. Roll out the dough 1/4" thick.
   <<<<NEVER TURN DOUGH OVER!>>>> Stop frequently & turn. Try not to get
  conf.sugar on the top-side. Use a RULER to measure. The dough should
  be large enough around for both the top & sides of cake. <For
  instance: 8"cake, dough should measure 14" in diameter if cake is 3"
  high.> Is table wide enough? 9. To drape icing on the cake: Elevate
  the cake on the Crisco pan.
   USING <PALMS> ONLY!, pick up icing dough by sliding both hands
  underneath & lifting gently.
   Center icing to cake & gently let it down on the cake. DON'T PLEAT!
  Cut off excess dough ABSOLUTELY level with bottom of c.board cake is
  setting on.
   Gently work out the "draping," by pressing gently with fingers. DON'T
  STRETCH THE ICING! 10. Now, using palms of hands only, rub gently in a
  circular motion to smooth. <The longer you "rub", the shinier the
  icing will get.> *If there are any "bubbles" in the icing, burst with
  a pin at an angle. 11. USING ON A CAKE DUMMY FOR SHOW: Use the porous
  foam that mashes. With a gumpaste roller, roll top edge to it isn't
  so sharp. Also mash any rough places. Fill in any holes w/royal
  icing. Set dummy on a cardboard the same size as the cake, glue down
  with royal icing.

      1/2 lb hot Italian sausage --
  :          casings discarded
        1 lg egg -- beaten lightly
        2 lb spinach, washed well and
  :          coarse stems discarded
        2 TB olive oil
        1    garlic clove  minced
        1    whole chicken (about 1
  :          pound)
  :          completely boned -- but left
  :          intact
        1 ts fresh lemon juice
        2 TB vegetable oil
  :          For the Sauce:
      1/4 c  chopped onion
        2 TB unsalted butter
        1 lg red bell pepper -- chopped
  :          fine
        1 lg green bell pepper -- chopped
  :          fine
      1/2 c  chicken stock
      1/2 c  dry white wine
        1 ts seeded and minced pickled
  :          jalapeno
  :          pepper, or to taste -- wear
  :          rubber gloves
        1 ts fresh lemon juice -- or to
  :          taste
  
  Make the rolled stuffed chicken:
  
  In a skillet cook the sausage over moderate heat, stirring and
  breaking up the lumps, until it is no longer pink and let it cool.
  Transfer the sausage with a slotted spoon to a food processor, add
  the egg, and pulse the mixture for 30 seconds, or until the sausage
  is chopped fine but not pureed. In a large saucepan cook the spinach
  in water clinging to the leaves, covered, over moderately high heat,
  stirring occasionally, for 3 to 5 minutes, or until it is wilted.
  Drain the spinach in a colander, refresh it under cold water, and
  squeeze dry. Chop the spinach coarsely and sprinkle it with salt and
  pepper. In a skillet heat the olive oil over moderate heat until it
  is hot but not smoking and in it cook the garlic, stirring, for 1
  minute. Add the spinach, cook the mixture 2 minutes, and let it cool.
  
  Flatten the chicken breast between sheets of dampened wax paper until
  it is about 1/4 inch thick, form it into a rectangular shape skinned
  side down, and sprinkle it with lemon juice and salt and pepper to
  taste. Spread the spinach evenly on top of the chicken, leaving a 1/2
  inch border all around, spread the sausage mixture evenly on top of
  it, and beginning with the long side roll the chicken jelly roll
  fashion to enclose the stuffing, forming a log. Stretch the reserved
  chicken skin to form a rectangle 2 inches wider than the log and roll
  the skin around the chicken, covering as much of it as possible. Tie
  the rolled chicken at 1 inch intervals with the kitchen string, pat
  it dry, and season it with salt and pepper. In an oven proof skillet
  heat the vegetable oil over moderately high heat until it is hot but
  not smoking and in it brown the chicken. Bake the roll chicken, seam
  side down, in a pre-heated 350 degree oven for 30 minutes and let it
  stand, covered for 10 minutes.
  
  Make the sauce while the chicken is baking: In a skillet cook the
  onion in the butter over moderately low heat, stirring until it is
  softened, add the bell peppers, and cook the mixture, covered
  stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Add the stock and the wine and
  bring the liquid to a boil, and simmer the mixture covered for 10
  minutes. Add the jalapeno pepper, the lemon juice, and the salt and
  pepper to taste and puree the mixture in a blender. The sauce may be
  made 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled.
  
  Discard the strings from the rolled chicken and cut the chicken
  crosswise into 12 or 16 slices. Pour about 1/3 cup of the sauce
  heated, on each of 4 heated plates and arrange 3 or 4 chicken slices
  on each plate.

 Categories: Desserts, Chocolate, Formatted, Puddings
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------THE PUDDING-----------------------------
      6 c  Heavy cream
      2 c  Milk, whole
      1 c  Sugar, granulated
     10 oz Chocolate, white; broken
           -into small pieces
      4    Eggs
     15    Egg yolks
      1    Bread, French 24" loaf

MMMMM-------------------------THE SAUCE------------------------------
      8 oz Chocolate, white; broken
           -into pieces
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
      1 oz Chocolate, dark; for garnish
 
    Preheat oven to 275F.
    In a large saucepan, heat the whipping cream, milk and sugar over
  medium heat until the mixture just begins to bubble around the edges
  but is not boiling. Add the white chocolate pieces and stir until
  melted. Remove from heat. Combine the whole eggs and the egg yolks in
  a large bowl. Slowly pour the hot cream mixture into the eggs in a
  steady stream, whipping the eggs as you pour. Slice the bread 1 inch
  thick (Use stale bread, or slice the bread then dry in a 275^ oven
  for about 10 minutes)
    Place the bread in a pan measuring about 9 x 12 inches. Pour half
  the egg mixture over the bread. Use your fingers to press the bread
  into the mix so that it absorbs the liquid and becomes soggy. Pour in
  the remaining mix. Cover the pan with foil and bake in a 350 degree
  oven for 1 hour. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 30
  minutes, or until the pudding is set and top is golden brown. Make
  the sauce: Bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan. Remove from
  the heat and add the white chocolate, stirring until smooth and
  completely melted. Spoon over the bread pudding.
    To serve: You can either serve the bread pudding warm, spooned
  right out of the pan and topped with the sauce and grated chocolate,
  or prepare ahead of time for a more polished presentation. Chill the
  bread pudding until completely set and firm, about 6 to 8 hours.
  Loosen the sides from the pan with a knife and invert the pudding
  onto a cutting surface. Cut into 6 squares, then cut the squares in
  half to make 12 triangles. Place the triangles on a cookie sheet and
  heat in a 275^ oven for 15 minutes. Serve with sauce and garnish with
  chocolate shavings.

      6 oz Macaroni
 12 1/2 fl Milk
    1/2 pt Single cream
      1 oz Butter
      1 oz Plain flour
      4 oz Cheddar cheese
      1 oz Parmesan cheese
 
  *Note: Weight given for turkey or chicken is skinned, boned weight.
  Goose, pheasant and other birds can be used instead.
  
  **Well-flavoured, clear stock and a little gelatine powder may be
  substituted for canned consomme.
  
  Make a smooth, rich sauce with the butter, flour, milk and cream. Let
  it simmer for about 4 minutes.  Then, away from the heat, stir in the
  grated Cheddar and Parmesan, a seasoning of nutmeg and some salt and
  pepper - but go carefully with the salt in view of the cheeses and
  salted meats used in this dish.  Let the sauce cool while you cook
  the macaroni in plenty of salted water until al dente.  Plunge the
  pasta in cold water to arrest cooking, drain well and stir it into
  the sauce.
  
  Slice the mushrooms thickly and saute them well in a non-stick pan
  with no fat.  Season them with about 1 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice,
  plenty of pepper and a little salt and allow to become cold. Then cut
  the turkey meat into pieces about the width and half the length of
  your little finger, and mix the poultry and mushrooms together.
  
  Cut the ham, tongue and drained anchovies into strips about the same
  length as the poultry but considerably less wide. Mix the anchovies,
  ham and tongue with a good quantity of fairly coarsely chopped
  parsley.
  
  Sprinkle about one third to half of the ham mixture over the base of a
  shallow dish of 4 to 4-1/2 pint capacity. Cover with half the macaroni
  mixture, then all the turkey mixture, then the rest of the macaroni.
  Spread each layer evenly and press down into the dish with a potato
  masher before adding the next layer. Cover and chill for 30 minutes.
  
  Arrange the remaining ham mixture on top and scatter the olives to
  make a decorative display of the pink, green and black ingredients.
  Press down lightly then pour on enough barely melted consomme or cool
  jellied stock to cover.
  
  Cover the dish and refrigerate for a few hours until set. Better
  still, refrigerate Roman pie overnight to allow flavours to blend and
  mature, but be sure to bring it back to room temperature at least two
  hours before serving.

 Categories: Chile peppe, Chili, Texas cooki
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Lean beef
    1/4 lb Beef fat
     12 lg Red chile peppers -- OR to
           Taste
      2 tb Chile powder
      1 tb Paprika
      2    Pods garlic
      2 ts Chopped oregano
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      1 c  Minced onion
           Beef stock -- as needed
           Salt and pepper -- to taste
 
  This California-based cookbook, edited and "modernized" in 1929 by
  Pauline Wile-Kleeman, has three chili recipes. The one labeled "Texas
  style" contains onions, beans and tomatoes, plus a whole cup of extra
  fat, half suet and half lard! The "California" version is also made
  with beans, but without tomatoes or onions. The first, and best
  recipe has none of these things.
  
  Chile con Carne without Beans
  
  Remove the seeds and veins from the chile peppers, place in
  sufficient hot water to cover, bring to boiling point, and cool in
  the water, drain and remove the pulp with a spoon. Cut the meat and
  suet in 3/4 inch cubes, heat the oil and fry the meat and suet to a
  light brown, then add onions and garlic and continue to cook,
  stirring continuously; before the onions start to brown add chile
  pulp, paprika, stir a few minutes, then add oregano, salt and pepper
  and sufficient stock to finish cooking till the meat is tender. Serve
  with beans or Spanish rice.

  baking soda, seasonings, and garlic puree together. Add Beef Stock
  and mix well. For each sausage, take 1/3 cup of the meat mixture, and
  roll between the palms of your hands into a sausage shape about 4
  inches long. Place sausages side by side in a container and cover.
  Refrigerate overnight so that the flavors can blend. These are
  excellent on the grill. They may also be broiled or baked in the
  oven. Broil the sausages about 3 minutes per side until cooked

 Categories: Chinese, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      4 lb Frying chicken, cut into
           -sections
           Arrowroot
           MARINADE:
      1 ts Sesame oil
      1 tb Dry sherry
    1/4 ts Chinese Five Spices (see
           -note below)
    1/4 ts White pepper
      1    Clove pressed garlic
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
      1 ts Grated fresh ginger root
 
  For teriyaki lovers, here's the finest recipe inspired by the
  excellent little pamphlet Cook in Clay published by the makers of the
  Romertopf pot. We've served this dish, with variations, to as many as
  a dozen guests with never anything less than ecstatic results. The
  chicken comes out tender and full of flavor, especially after being
  marinated in this incredible sauce. You can add all sorts of Chinese
  or Japanese seasonings, but be sure they stay on the bland side.
  Caution: Don't add any salt-there's enough in any good soy sauce. (We
  prefer the rich, heavy soy sauce bottled in Hong Kong in a brown
  stone jug by Ko Sang Yick.)
  
  In a non-metal bowl, combine the ingredients for the marinade, mix
  well, and marinate the pieces of chicken for at least half a day,
  turning frequently.
  
  When ready to cook, presoak pot, top and bottom, in water for 15
  minutes.
  
  Add the chicken and the marinade to the pot.
  
  Place covered pot in a cold oven.
  
  Set temperature to 450 degrees F.
  
  Cook 45 minutes.
  
  Ten minutes before end of cooking time, remove the pot and pour off
  the liquid into a saucepan.
  
  Return the pot to the oven, uncovered, for the final
       10    minutes of cooking.
  
  Meanwhile, bring the liquid in saucepan to a boil and thicken with
  arrowroot.
  
  Serve with rice, liberally drenched with the sauce.
  
  For an optional Chinese touch, sprinkle the chicken with almonds and
  sesame seeds.
  
  Note: Chinese Five Spices are a combination, in powder form, usually
  found in Chinese markets. If not available, use star anise, ground to
  a powder with a mortar and pestle.

MMMMM----------------------TANGERINE LAMPS---------------------------
      1    Tangerines***
           Olive oil
           Glass votive cups
 
  *** One tangerine per person and a couple extra for practice. Cut
  through the rind of the tangerine around the middle, perhaps a little
  closer to the stem end than to the bottom. Gently loosen the skin
  from the sections, and carefully remove the top (the half including
  the stem end). Gently remove the sections from the bottom half, being
  sure to leave some of the pithy center part attached to the bottom
  half of the shell. Press the pithy strands together to form a sort of
  wick about 1/4 to 1/2" long. Put about a spoonful of oil in the
  bottom half and swirl it around to coat the inside of the shell. With
  the whole inside of the shell oil-coated, the lamp will look better
  and last longer. Add or remove oil to leave a slight puddle in the
  bottom of the shell about 1/16" deep. Then light the wick. This will
  probably take several tries, before it will stay lit. Next, take the
  top half, and cut a 1" hole in the center so that the flame can get
  air when you set the top back on the bottom half. Oil the inside of
  the top half of the lamp, and then wipe it dry so that more light
  will be able to shine through. Place the lamp on top of the votive
  cup and it is ready.

      Title: RON SANTO'S LINGUINE WITH CLAM SAUCE
 Categories: Pasta
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Cube clam base
      1 c  Ocean clams (25.5 oz)
      1 tb Olive oil
      1    Bunch green onion, chopped
    1/2 c  Diced domestic mushrooms
    1/8 c  Fresh basil, chopped
      2 tb Fresh minced garlic
      1    Stick butter, melted
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
      2 md Tomatoes, seeded and diced
    1/2 c  White wine
 
  Before he became a Hall of Fame contender as one of the best
  third-basemen in history, Ron Santo toiled as a groundkeeper, a
  batboy, and an usher for Seattle's PAcific Coast League team. But
  sweet success came along soon enough, says Santo. "Vada Pinson, who
  was a great ballplayer for the Reds, used to come by, and I'd shine
  his shoes. He went to the majors in 1958, and by 1960, I was in the
  big leagues, so I went from shining his shoes to playing against him
  in just two years."
  
  Santo put away his shoeshine kit when the Chicago Cubs drafted him in
  1960, and he played for them through 1973. Over his 13 years with the
  club, he won five Rawlings Gold Glove awards and racked up 337 home
  runs, the third-highest total in Cubs history.
  
  Thes days Santo spends his ballpark time in the broadcast booth
  rather than the dugout, as the Cubs play-by-play analyst. "It's a lot
  easier up where I am now than it is down on the field."
  
  When Santo isn't on the air, he's in the kitchen of his restaurant and
  sports bar, Ron Santo's American Rotisserie, which specializes in
  chicken, ribs, steaks, and pasta. "I eat there every night with my
  wife, and the waiters and waitresses will come over and say, 'They'd
  like to see you at that table over there for an autograph.' I
  designed a baseball card for the restaurant with a picture of me in a
  suit on the back and a picture of me in a baseball uniform on the
  front. It gives all my stats. My customers eat it up."
  
  That is, when they're not devouring his Linguine with Clam Sauce.
  
  In a bowl, dissolve clam base in reserved juice from canned clams. In
  large saucepan, heat olive oil until sizzling. Saute onions,
  mushrooms, basil and garlic. Add butter and cayenne. Stir in
  tomatoes, wine and clams in base mixture, and cook for 3-4 minutes.
  Cook linguine until it is AL DENTE; drain well. Top with sauce.

      Title: RON-AGAIN'S RYE BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
    1/2 tb Yeast
      1 c  Rye flour
  2 3/4 c  Bread flour
    1/3 c  Sugar, brown
      2 ts Caraway seed
    1/2 tb Salt
      2 tb Butter
  1 1/2 c  Water, warm
 
  Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
  order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
  push Start.
  
  This is the best rye bread recipe I've ever made in the DAK R2D2. It
  was given to me by Ron Lanning, and I think he may also have posted
  it on the board. His recipe was for the small machine, and this my
  adaptation for the larger ones.
  
  It makes a very light, fluffy rye with a nice, domed top.
  
  I find that my rye bread does better if I leave the dough a little on
  the wet side. It will rise like crazy, so just before the bake cycle
  starts, I press it down just a bit to keep it from collapsing during
  the bake cycle.

 Categories: Vegetables, Roots
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Rutabagas
    2/3 lb Carrots
    2/3 lb Red-skinned potatoes
      3 tb Butter
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      1 tb Minced parsley (opt)
 
  (From "More Vegetables, Please" by Janet Fletcher. Harlow and Ratner,
  Emeryville, California; $16.95, 1992)
  
  Peel the rutabagas, removing all traces of the thick skin. Cut them
  into 1/2" cubes. Peel the carrots and slice them about 1/2" thick.
  Scrub the potatoes well but do not peel them; cut them into pieces
  about the same size as the rutabagas.
  
  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the
  rutabagas and cook 5 minutes, then add the remaining vegetables and
  cook until they are soft enough to mash but not mushy, about 15 more
  minutes. Drain thoroughly in a colander.
  
  Put the hot vegetables in a clean pot and shake the pot over moderate
  heat until the vegetables are completely dry. Remove the pot from the
  heat, add the butter in small pieces, and mash the vegetables gently
  with a potato masher; they should be mashed, not pureed. Season to
  taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a warm serving bowl. Garnish
  with parsley if desired.

      6 c  Homemade chicken stock
      3 md Carrots peeled and cubed
      3 md Turnips peeled and cubed
      2 md Parsnips peeled and cubed
      2 md Red potatoes peeled and
           Cubed

    1/2 c  Heavy cream
      2 tb Fine minced chives
           And parsley for garnish
 
  Cut the leeks in half lengthwise and then crosswise into thin slices.
  Place in a colander and run under warm water to remove all traces of
  sand. Drain and set aside. In a large casserole, melt the butter over
  low heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly for one minute
  without browning. Add the chicken stock and whisk until well blended.
  Add the reserved leeks, carrots, turnips, parsnips and potatoes.
  Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until the vegetables are
  almost tender. Add the lettuce and spinach leaves to the soup, and

      Title: ROPA VEJA (TRANS." OLD CLOTHES")
 Categories: Mexican, Beef
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      4 lb Boneless chuck roast
      1 lg White onion, thin sliced
      1    Sweet Bell pepper,
           -thinly sliced *
      1 cn Beef broth (not condensed)
 
  * (I'd personally substitute several roasted Anaheim or Poblano
  peppers, but Bell would be a safer choice for the heat-shy)
  
  Lay half the onions and peppers in a large heavy stewing pot. Add the
  roast, and cover with the remaining peppers.
  
  Add enough beef broth to come about halfway up the side of the roast.
  Cover, and cook over medium-low heat, turning the roast occasionally,
  until the meat is virtually falling apart (3- 4 hours). If you have a
  crock pot, all day (without turning) is fine.
  
  Remove the roast from the pot, pull off and discard any remaining
  fat, and using a fork or your fingers, pull the lean meat into
  shreds. Mix in the onions/peppers and enough of the de-fatted cooking
  liquid to form a juicy, but not soupy mixture. Season to taste with
  salt. This will reheat very well, or hold nicely in a chafing dish.
  
  Use as a filling for soft or hard tacos (lowest in fat would be soft
  tacos made with steamed or lightly heated corn tortillas).

  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich spinach pie with ham and cheese -- I ate this dish at Cafe
  Le Rat in Middleburg, Virginia, and was delighted to find their
  recipe in _Gourmet_ magazine in the late 1970s. I have modified the
  recipe somewhat from the published version to make it less stringy
  and sticky.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 45 minutes baking and cooling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: ROSE HIP JAM
 Categories: Vegetables, Oct.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 qt Rose hips with black ends
           Removed
           (about 5 pounds)
  3 1/2 c  Sugar
        x  Water (Wine or sherry)
 
  Gather the rose hips after the first frost. I am not sure why this is
  done but I have several sources that say to do it, including my
  grandmother, so I wait. Wash the rose hips well in case there is any
  insecticide residue. Cover with water and simmer until the hips are
  very soft and falling apart. Press through a food mill or colander to
  remove the seeds and larger particles.  Press through a finer sieve
  to remove the smaller fibers and seed bits.
  
  Cook the pulp down until it is quite thick. How thick? That is hard
  to say. Thicker than heavy cream.  I check the measurements at this
  point. I add about a pound of sugar for every pound of pulp. The 3
  1/2 cups is my measurement from the last time I made this.
  
  Add the sugar and check the taste.  Sometimes I add a bit more sugar.
  Rose hips have enough pectin to jell and enough ascorbic acid to make
  it a little tart. Cook over high heat until the mixture has a thick
  jam-like consistency. Put in jars.  Makes 4 half-pint jars

  1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
  1 1/2 c  Milk
    2/3 c  Sugar
      3    Egg yolks
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      2 tb Rose-scented geranium
           -leaves; chopped

      1 ts Rose water or up to 3
      2 tb Pink rose petals**
 
  *Loosely packed; white bases removed
  
  ** white bases removed; chopped
  
  In a heavy 2-quart saucepan or double boiler over medium-low heat,
  stir and heat the cream, milk, and sugar until the sugar dissolves.
  Do not boil.
  
  In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks lightly. While whisking, pour 1
  cup of the hot cream mixture into the bowl, then pour the egg mixture
  back into the saucepan and place over medium-low heat. Stir
  constantly with a wooden spoon (don't let the mixture boil; it could
  curdle) for about 8 minutes, or until it begins to thicken and coats
  the spoon. To test for doneness, dip a metal spoon into the mixture
  and run your finger across the back. The custard is done when your
  finger leaves a clear, clean trail. A candy thermometer should read
  175-180 degrees F. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the
  vanilla.
  
  Stir the chopped rose-scented geranium leaves and the 1 1/2 cups of
  rose petals into the hot prepared ice-cream base. Cover and chill in
  the refrigerator for at least 1 hour (the longer it is refrigerated,
  the stronger the flavor will be). Strain the mixture and add rose
  water to taste, if desired. Stir in the chopped rose petals. Pour the
  mixture into an ice-cream maker and freeze according to the
  manufacturer's instructions.

 Categories: Canning, Flowers, Harned 1994, Jam/jelly, Preserving
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      2 c  Loosely packed rose petals
           -- fresh, washed, unsprayed
           -- stems & centers removed
      2 c  ;Water
  3 3/4 c  Sugar
      3 tb Strained fresh lemon juice
      3 oz Liquid pectin
           -- such as Certo, Sure-jell
 
  Sauer writes:  "Here is a recipe that Crescent Dragonwagon posted on
  another service. Although I have not yet tried it, I have had great
  success with all of her recipes.  (She and her husband own the Dairy
  Hollow House Bed and Breakfast in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, and she's
  the author of several outstanding cookbooks, which include fantastic
  vegetarian recipes.)"
  
  Pulse water and rose petals in processor briefly.  You don't want a
  pulp, just a coarse chop, a few on-offs.  Scrape mixture into a large
  (3 quart) saucepan, bring to a boil quickly, and immediately turn off
  heat. Let rose petals infuse in water 15 minutes.  Strain, discarding
  spent petals.
  
  Measure out 1 3/4 cups rose infusion and replace in saucepan.  Add
  sugar and lemon and bring to a high, hard boil, stirring until sugar
  is dissolved and mixture has reached a boil that cannot be stirred
  down. At this point, add pectin.  Return to hard boil, and let boil
  at a full roll exactly one minute (time it).  Remove from heat.
  
  Put up hot, in hot jars, checking for seal once jelly has cooled.
  
  NOTES:  The rose petal jelly will change from pink or reddish to
  brown, then back during the process.
  
  Variations:  This basic recipe works beautifully for herb infusions.
  Sweet basil jelly is divine.

 Categories: Misc, Flowers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Red rose petals
           Water
 
  Fill a vessel with red rose petals and cover with water. Keep water
  just at the boiling point, but do not boil. After an hour remove the
  petals and add more petals.  Repeat this until it has the proper
  strength, then bottle. For ROSE SYRUP: Take a pint of warm rose water
  and dissolve 2 pounds of fine granulated sugar in it. A Turkish
  recipe recommends adding a few poppy petals and a tablespoon of lemon
  juice, but it is not necessary to add these ingredients. Some purists
  just like the roses and sugar. Bottle and keep in refrigerator.

      Title: ROSEHIP SYRUP
 Categories: Misc, Beverages, British
      Yield: 600 Mls
 
      2 lb Ripe rosehips; washed
      1 lb Sugar
     60 fl Boiling water
     30 fl Boiling water
 
  Bring the water to the boil in a large, preferably stainless steel or
  unchopped enamelled saucepan. Press the rosehips through the coarse
  blade of a mincer and place immediately in the first (larger) batch
  of boiling water. Bring the mixture to the boil again . As soon as
  the mixture boils, remove the pan from the heat and leave 15 minutes.
    Pour the rosehips into a scalded jelly bag and allow the bulk of the
  juice to drip through. Return the pulp in the jelly bag to the
  saucepan, add the second quantity of boiling water, re-boil, then
  allow to stand without further heating for another 10 minutes.
    Pour the juice into a clean saucepan and simmer to reduce to the
  volume of the second quantity of water. Add sugar in the proportion
  of 1 lb for each 30 fl of juice. Stir till dissolved, then boil for a
  further 5 minutes.
    Pour the hot syrup into hot bottles and seal at once. Sterilise for
  5 minutes. If using corks only, seal with melted paraffin or sealing
  wax.
   NB. It is advisable to use small bottles as the syrup will not keep
  for more than a week or two once opened.

      Title: ROSEHIP~ HIBISCUS & CURRANT PIE OR CAKE FILLING
 Categories: Flowers, Fruits, Pies, Cakes
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
  1 1/2 c  Water
      3 oz Rosehips
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
      1    Cinnamon stick
      3    Herbal tea bags (a brand
           With hibiscus or rosehips
      1 c  Currant jelly, red or black
           Or a mixture
      1 tb Lemon juice
  1 1/2 ts Butter or marg.
    1/2 ts Flour
 
  Boil the water, cinnamon, and herbal tea until the water is reduced
  to one cup. Remove the cinnamon and herbal tea and add the brown
  sugar, lemon juice, and rosehips, and simmer briskly (medium heat)
  until the water is just above the rosehips. Then, add the currant
  jelly, and stir till it is all dissolved; continue simmering for five
  minutes, stirring all the while and watching carefully for scorching.
  Blend butter and flour thoroughly, and stir into the currant jelly
  mixture until it is thickened. Take the mixture off the heat; it is
  ready to use.
  
  Note#1 : If you want to avoid the extra butter, blend the flour with a
  tablespoon or more of water; you want to suspend the flour in the
  water, not have a batter. Take the currant mixture off the heat, stir
  in the flour mixture all at once and thoroughly, and then return it
  to the heat to thicken.
  
  Note #2: omit the butter and flour, and perhaps add a chopped apple,
  some raisins, etc, for a healthful fruit stew.

      Title: ROSEMARY OLIVE OIL BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ts Active dry yeast
  1 1/2 c  Water -- 105-115 degrees
      2 c  Basic bread sponge
      3 tb Extra virgin olive oil
           Extra virgin olive oil --
           For brushing
      3 c  Unbleached all-purpose
           Flour
    1/3 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
           For kneading
    1/2 c  Whole wheat flour --
           Preferably organic
    1/4 c  Fresh rosemary -- finely
           Chopped
      2 tb Kosher salt
           Cornmeal -- for sprinkling
 
  Measure the rosemary *after* chopping.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  Place the walnuts on a baking sheet,
  roasting until fragrant and golden brown, about eight minutes. Cool.
  
  In a bowl, dissolve  the yeast in the water.  Allow to proof for three
  minutes.
  
  Stir the sponge and 3 tablespoons oil into the water, breaking the
  sponge up using your hands or a spoon. Stir in the rosemary and salt.
  
  Add 3 cups of the unbleached flour, the whole wheat flour, and salt
  and mix, scraping and folding until the dough gathers into a single
  mass which will be wet and sticky with strands hanging from your
  fingers.
  
  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and allow to rest
  for 3 minutes.  knead in as much of the 1/3 cup of flour as is
  required to make a smooth, elastic and only slightly sticky dough
  (use as little flour as is possible).  Shape into a ball.
  
  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, brush the top of the dough
  with additional oil, and cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate
  overnight.
  
  Remove from the refrigerator and allow to warm-up in a draft-free
  spot for two hours.
  
  Sprinkle a baking sheet without sides generously with cornmeal. On a
  floured work surface, halve the dough and then shape one piece into a
  ball, pressing to remove any large bubbles at the edges. Place the
  dough-ball on the baking sheet, being sure to put the seam on the
  bottom. Repeat with the second ball, leaving 3 to 4 inches between
  the two. Cover with plastic and allow to rise until doubled, in a
  draft-free location. This should take 2-2 1/2 hours. These loaves
  will be flat and wide.
  
  Preheat the oven for at least thirty minutes along with a baking
  stone or tiles on the middle rack to 425. Place a baking pan with
  decent sides on the bottom shelf. Boil two cups of water. Brush the
  loaves again with oil and then, using a razor blade, make a
  tic-tac-toe pattern in the top of each of the loaves - do not tear
  the dough, you want to cut it. Pour the boiling water into the baking
  pan.  Slide the loaves off the sheet and onto the stone.
  
  Bake for 20 minutes, reduce the temperature to 350 and then bake for
  another 30-35 minutes until the loaves are a light golden brown and
  hollow sounding when tapped on the bottom. When done, brush with
  additional olive oil and transfer to cool on a rack.

      Title: ROSEMARY SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter
      1 lg Shallot, Chopped
      1 tb Fresh Rosemary, Chopped
    1/4 c  Dry White Wine
    1/2 c  Brown Stock (See Stocks)
    1/2 c  Heavy Cream
 
  Rosemary and lamb seem to go together, naturally, whether the herb is
  sprinkled on chops while grilling or incorporated in a savory sauce.
  This sauce is also delicious with cold roast lamb or any of that
  butterflied roast left over from the Sunday barbecue. Inspired by a
  sauce once served at New York City's American Harvest Restaurant,
  this makes a wonderful addition to a summer menu.
  
  Salt And Freshly Ground Black Pepper
  
  Heat the butter in a medium-size heavy skillet over medium heat. Add
  the shallot and saute until transparent, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add
  the rosemary and wine and cook over high heat until most of the
  liquid has evaporated, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Stir in the stock and
  continue to cook over high heat until the liquid is reduced by half.
  Add the heavy cream, and season, then boil over medium heat for 3
  minutes. Strain through a sieve lined with cheesecloth if you prefer
  a smooth sauce; do not if a more textured sauce is appropriate. The
  sauce should be very hot. Serve immediately.
  
  Yield:  About 1 cup of sauce.

  Variation:  For iced tea, chill the simmered mixture, then dilute it
  with 1 quart of sparkling water.  Serve over ice with a twist of
  orange peel.

      Title: ROSEMARY-LIME VINEGAR/AND VARIATIONS
 Categories: Mixes
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      4 c  White-wine vinegar
           (plus more, if
           Needed)
      3    Cloves garlic
      6 lg Sprigs fresh rosemary
      1    Lime -- thinly sliced
 
  Flavored vinegars look sensational in antique bottles...or maybe even
  just old ones that you may find at a country fair. You can experiment
  with all sorts of different herbs, berries, or types of vinegars and
  oils, using this recipe & the one that follows as a base. Just be
  sure to store the vinegar and oil, tightly closed, for at least 2
  weeks before tasting it and making your final decision.  Whether or
  not to strain your gift before presenting it is up to you and depends
  on how enticing the flavorings look; prolonged immersion suits some
  better than others. Give this vinegar alone or with a bottle of the
  best olive oil you can find. If you want to mail it, pack it,
  cushioned with straw, into the kind of heavy mailing tube that
  artists use for sending out rolled-up posters. Two hints before you
  start: Use a stainless-steel saucepan when heating the vinegar to
  avoid producing a metallic taste. Take care not to cut the surface of
  the garlic cloves because contact with the garlic juice will cause
  the vinegar to become cloudy.        Bring the vinegar slowly to a
  boil in a saucepan over moderate heat. Peel the garlic cloves, but do
  not cut them. Place a clove in each of two 1-pint, sterilized
  bottles. Carefully strain the hot vinegar into the bottles and add 3
  rosemary sprigs to each. Divide the slices between the bottles and
  seal each bottle with its cork or cap. Heat more vinegar and add to
  the bottle, if needed, to fill completely. Store in a cool dry place
  for at least 2 weeks before using. For best results, use within 6
  months. Variations: To make Hot Chile-Pepper Vinegar, substitute 2
  (or more) jalapeno chiles for the rosemary and bring to a boil in the
  vinegar. Add them to the bottles along with the garlic cloves. Seal,
  label, and store as before. (If you leave the chiles in the vinegar,
  the recipient will know that you intend Hot to be taken seriously.)
  To make Lemon-Garlic Vinegar, substitute one sliced lemon for the
  lime, and delete the rosemary. Source:  An Edible Christmas Cookbook

  I adapted this from the Sunset Italian cookbook. It came out just

  if you are not watching fats, I bet it is wonderful that way.Cook on

  was at the start of the second knead. Makes good sandwich bread or

  Basic Sponge
  
  In processor fitted with metal blade, mix Basic Sponge with water,
  salt, honey, olive oil and rosemary until smooth. Combine flours and
  add to sponge mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, pulsing several times to
  incorporate each addition. Then process dough until supple, elastic
  and stick- ing slightly to work bowl, about 1 minute, adding more
  water or flour by teaspoon, if dough is either too dry or too wet.
  Dough should be very sticky, almost wet.
  
  Transfer dough to large plastic bag, squeeze out all air and seal
  tightly on top to allow room for dough to expand. Set bag in bowl and
  let dough rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. Can be
  refrigerated overnight once punched down.
  
  Oil round pizza pans, preferably black steel. Sprinkle with corn meal.
  Divide dough in half. Gently stretch each into about 12-inch diameter
  round. Transfer to pans. Dimple dough with fingers.
  
  Heat butter with garlic until melted. Brush over surface of each
  focaccia, dividing evenly. Scatter sun-dried tomatoes on top. Season
  to taste with salt and crushed hot red pepper. If baking 1 focaccia
  at a time, refrigerate unbaked loaf until after first is baked.
  
  Bake on lower rack of 425-degree oven until lightly browned on edge,
  about 18 to 20 minutes. Cut into wedges. Serve warm. Makes 2
  (13-inch- diameter) focaccia loaves, or 4 servings.

      Title: ROSIE'S AWARD-WINNING BROWNIES
 Categories: Brownies
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      4 oz Unsweetened chocolate
      8 tb Unsalted butter, at room
           -temperature
  1 1/4 c  Sugar
      1 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
    3/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Chopped walnuts
      2 tb Chopped walnuts
 
  (From "Rosie's Bakery All Butter, Fresh Cream, Sugar-Packed,
  No-Holds-Barred Baking Book" by Judy Rosenberg. Workman. $12.95)
  
  Preheat the oven to 325'F. Lightly grease an 8" square pan with
  butter or vegetable oil.
  
  Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler placed
  over simmering water. Cool the mixture for 5 minutes. Place the sugar
  in a medium-size mixing bowl and pour in the chocolate mixture. Using
  an electric mixer on medium speed, mix until blended, about 25
  seconds. Scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula.
  
  Add the vanilla. With the mixer on medium-low speed, add the eggs one
  at a time, blending after each addition until the yolk is broken and
  dispersed, about 10 seconds. Scrape the bowl after the last egg and
  blend until velvety, about 15 more seconds.
  
  Add the flour on low speed and mix for 20 seconds. Finish the mixing
  by hand, being certain to mix in any flour at the bottom of the bowl.
  Stir in 1/2 cup of the nuts.
  
  Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan and sprinkle the
  remaining 2 tablespoons of nuts over the top.
  
  Bake the brownies on the center oven rack until a thin crust forms on
  top and a tester inserted in the center comes out with a moist crumb,
  about 35 minutes. The center of the brownies should never quite rise
  to the height of the edges.
  
  Remove the pan from the oven and place it on a rack to cool for 1 hour
  before cutting the brownies. Serve the next day - it takes a day for
  the flavor to set.
  
  Makes 9-12 brownies.

 Categories: Rosie's
      Yield: 1 Cup
 
  1 1/2 c  Basil leaves, fresh
      2    Garlic cloves, peeled (may
           -use up to 5 cloves)  *
    1/4 c  Pine nuts
    1/4 c  Parmesan cheese, fresh grate
    1/4 c  Lemon juice, fresh squeezed
 
  Put the basil, garlic, pine nuts, and parmesan cheese in a blender or
  food processor. Turn the machine on and drizzle in the lemon juice.
  Continue to puree until a smooth paste is formed. * The amount of
  garlic you use is a matter of personal taste.  Also, some garlic is
  more pungent. So start perhaps with 2 medium cloves, then taste, and
  add more if, as I do, you like a strong, garlicky flavor. Makes 3/4

      Title: ROSS FAMILY FAVORITE TURKEY
 Categories: Poultry, Misc
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1    Fresh or frozen turkey
           Oil, or melted margarine,
           Or even mayonnaise or
           Honey
           Salt
           Pepper
           Paprika
           Garlic powder
           Poultry seasoning
           Stuffing/ gravy(optional)
           Onions, celery , carrots
 
  Bring your turkey to room temperature. If frozen, thaw according to
  label directions. An ice cold or very cold turkey does not roast
  well. Some cooks rinse the turkey with water and pat it dry.When you
  handle any poultry be very careful and clean with preparation and
  cleanup.
  
  Season the turkey inside and out liberally with the above seasonings.
  If you want a stuffed turkey it is very convenient to use a
  cheesecloth to enclose the stuffing for the turkey cavity. Stuff just
  prior to baking.And remove the stuffing after baking.This avoids any
  chance of spoilage and also aids in proper cooling of turkey and
  stuffing. Liberally spread some oil or melted margarine etc. (
  sometimes I even use mayonnaise or even honey ) over the seasoned
  turkey. Use a large enough roaster pan to hold the turkey.
  
  I place a layer of onions, celery and carrots beneath the turkey which
  flavors the gravy for later. Place the roaster pan on the lower oven
  shelf and start initial baking at preheated 375 to 400 degrees for 30
  to 45 minutes. Then reduce the heat to 350 or 325 degrees to complete
  the baking process. Baste frequently with pan juices and rotate the
  pan several times for even browning. Generally allow 15 to 20 minutes
  per pound for roasting.A stuffed turkey requires the additional time
  per pound. I always use an oven thermometer; some turkey's have pop
  up timers. When the turkey is finished cooking, allow to stand about
  20 minutes to 1/2 hour before carving. Juices settle and it is much
  easier to carve. I also enjoy decorating the turkey legs with foil
  for a festive look.
  
  Comment:  This is my way of roasting a turkey and there are many other
  favorite ways other cooks rely on .IUve tried many and rely on the
  above for a juicy, well browned bird.

      Title: ROSTI (SWISS FRIED POTATOES)
 Categories: Side dishes, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      6    Potatoes
      1    Onion; finely chopped
      4 sl Bacon; finely chopped
    1/4 c  Butter or lard
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  Boil the potatoes in their skins for 15 minutes until they are tender.
  Remove the pan from the heat, drain the potatoes and cool them under
  cold running water. When the potatoes are cool enough the handle,
  strip off the skins.  Grate the potatoes coarsely in a large bowl.
  Carefully mix in the chopped onion and bacon and reserve.
  
  heat the butter or lard in a large, heavy 9-inch skillet. When the
  fat is quite hot, add the potato mixture. Lightly pat the mixture
  into a round cake with a spatula. Cook over low heat until the
  underside is crusty and well-browned.
  
  Flip over and fry gently for 10 to 15 minutes until the second side is
  crisp and well-browned.  Turn the Rosti out onto a heated serving
  dish, cut into wedges and serve immediately.
  
  This dish of fried potatoes is served all over Switzerland, sometimes
  as an accompaniment to meat and sometimes as a central dish in a
  meatless meal. This variation is a favorite of the German-speaking
  sections of the country.

      Title: ROSTI (SWISS-STYLE POTATO CAKE)
 Categories: Swedish, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 3/4 lb Potatoes (see below)
      3 oz Butter, lard or bacon fat
  1 1/2 tb Water or milk
 
  This is a favorite dish of German-speaking Switzerland. Besides being
  served as a side dish with meat or fish, it is sometimes eaten on its
  own, for lunch or even breakfast, with milky coffee.
  
  The potatoes should be boiled in their jackets the day before. These
  should be waxy potatoes of the potato-salad kind. The next day, peel
  them and grate them on the coarsest blade of the grater. Heat a large
  heavy frying pan, and let the fat get hot: then put in the potatoes,
  sprinkle with salt, and fry, turning them constantly. When they have
  soaked up the butter or whatever, add more. Now form a "cake" by
  pushing the potatoes from the edges of the pan into the middle and
  flattening down the top.
  
  Sprinkle with the water or milk, reduce heat, and cover with a lid or
  inverted dish. Shake the covered pan occasionally to keep the
  potatoes from burning, and leave on low heat for at least 15 minutes.
  The potatoes must stick together, but not to the bottom of the pan.
  When cooked, turn the cake out onto a plate, bottom side up, and
  serve. (Or alternately, brown the other side as well.) . Variations:
  (1) Saute 2 T chopped onions in the fat before adding the potatoes.
  Don't let them brown. Also note that in this version, the potatoes
  will need less fat. (2) Saute 2 - 3 1/2 oz. diced bacon before adding
  potatoes. You won't need any extra salt. (3) Sprinkle cooked potatoes
  with grated cheese before serving, and heat it briefly in the oven to

      Title: ROTEL CHICKEN
 Categories: Main dish, Casseroles, Chicken
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      6 c  Chicken; cooked, cubed
      1 pk Vermicelli spaghetti (7 oz)
      2 lg Bell peppers; chopped
      2 lb Onions; chopped
      2    Celery stalks; chopped
      1 c  Mushrooms;sliced
    1/2 c  Butter
      2 cn Rotel tom.; diced (10 oz ea)
      2 tb Worcestershire sauce
      1 lb Cheddar cheese; grated
 
  Cook and season chicken.  Save 1-1/2 quarts broth. Cook spaghetti in
  broth; drain, but do not rinse.  In dutch oven or heavy pan; saute
  pepper, onion, celery and mushrooms in butter. Add tomatoes. Simmer
  for about 15 minutes to let the flavors blend.  Add spaghetti,
  chicken and cheese. Let simmer for another 15 or 20 minutes until
  cheese melts and everything is bubbly.
  
  Note: Flavors blend better if this is prepared a day ahead of time and
  refrigerated.
  
  I have also had this made with velveeta, but I MUCH prefer the cheddar
  cheese.  Have also seen variations that have english peas. You can
  really add more or less of the various vegetables to suit your taste.
  This particular version has evolved in our kitchen over the last
  dozen years. I also prefer it made with macaroni instead of spaghetti
  but I've never seen anyone else make it that way.

      1 cn (10 oz) diced Rotel
           -tomatoes, with liquid
      2    3 large potatoes

MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
 
  Eggbeaters equivalent of 4 eggs 2-3 oz. lowfat or nonfat cheese 4-6

  Microwave or boil the potatoes until they are half-cooked; the flesh
  should still be firm, and not crumbly. Let them cool until you can
  comfortable handle them, and cut into bite-sized pieces. In a large
  skillet, dump the can of Rotel tomatoes and most of the juice, then
  add potatoes. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until
  most of the tomato liquid has been absorbed by the potatoes (this
  takes anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes, and is usually dependant on how
  hungry you are).
  
  Optional: If you want to add eggs at this point, make a crater in the
  center of the pan and add eggs. Stir the eggs over medium heat until
  eggs are scrambled. When they are just about done, mix thoroughly
  with the potato mixture.
  
  Serve with cheese (optional), either alone, or wrapped in steamed
  tortillas. With the eggs and cheese, this make a simple, spicy, and
  very filling breakfast.
  
  Other ideas I have yet to try: Stir in spinach, zucchini, mushrooms,
  and or onions with the potatoes.

  Add the water, tomatoes, and seasoning packet, bring to a boil,

  find that the Spanish Style is pretty low-fat as boxed; about 1g fat
  per serving, 6 servings per box. If I wasn't so lazy, I'm sure I
  could make up with a dish that dry-frys vermicelli and rice, then
  cooks it with broth and spices, but at this point in my busy life,
  having a box in my cupboard is a bit easier. Posted by

      Title: ROTEL-N-RICE CORN SOUP
 Categories: Vegetarian, Digest
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 cn (10 oz) diced Rotel
           -tomatoes, with liquid
  1 1/2 c  Cooked rice
    1/2 pk Frozen corn
      3    4 cups vegetable stock, or
           -water
 
  ~---------------Optional------------------------------- ~----- 2-3
  corn tortillas, cut into 2 inch strips 1/2 red pepper, seeded and cut
  in strips
  
  If using red pepper, saute at the bottom of a large soup pot, using a
  little bit of the broth. Add the tomatoes, cooked rice, corn, and
  stock to the pot, and heat thoroughly, about 10 minutes or so.
  
  Just before serving, stir in tortilla strips.
  
  (Note: I think the spiciness of the Rotel provides enough seasoning,
  but a little pepper, fresh cilantro, onion, etc. might be nice as
  well. Think of this recipe as a base for a spicy soup, and
  experiment!).

      Title: ROTI (FLAT WHOLE-WHEAT BREAD)
 Categories: Breads, Digest, August
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2 c  Chappati Flour
           OR
      1 c  Whole-wheat flour mixed w/
      1 c  Cake flour
           Additional flour for
           Dusting
 
  Put the flour in a bowl.  Slowly add enough water so that you will be
  able to gather the flour together and make a soft dough. You may need
  about 2 1/2 tablespoons less than a cup of water. Knead the dough for
  7 to 8 minutes or until it is smooth.  Make a ball and put it inside
  a bowl. Cover the bowl with a damp dishcloth and set it aside for
  half an hour.
  
  If the dough looks very runny, flour your hands and knead for another
  few minutes.  Form twelve equal balls and dust each with a little
  flour. Keep them covered.
  
  Set a cast-iron griddle or skillet to heat over a medium-low flame.
  Allow at least 5 minutes for that. Keep about a cup of dusting flour
  near you. Remove a ball of dough and flatten it between the palms of
  your hands. Dust it on both sides with flour.  Roll it out, as thinly
  and evenly as you can, aiming for a 5 1/2 inch round. When the
  griddle is hot, slap the roti onto its heated surface.  Cook for
  about a minute or until soft bubbles begin to form.  Turn the roti
  over. Cook for half a minute on the second side.
  
  If you have a gas fire, light a second burner on a medium flame and
  put the roti directly on it.  Using tongs, rotate the roti so that
  all areas are exposed to the shooting flames. Take 5 seconds to do
  this. Turn the roti over and repeat for about 3 seconds. The roti
  should puff up. Put the roti on a plate and cover with a towel. Make
  all roti this way.
  
  If you have an electric stove, place the griddle and roti under a
  broiler for a few seconds, until the roti puffs up. Serve hot.

      Title: ROTI DOUGH
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 x  Vegetable oil
    1/4 ts Baking soda
      1 x  Milk to mix
 
    Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt into a bowl. Add
  enough to form a stiff dough.  Knead the dough well on a lightly
  floured board, form into 4 or more equal-sized balls. Roll out the
  dough thinly to form 8-inch or 12-inch circles.  Then brush on a thin
  coating of vegetable oil. Roll into balls again, cover, and allow to
  stand for 15 minutes at room temperature.
    Roll out the dough again and flatten to the original dimensions by
  patting lightly.  Heat a cast-iron or heavy-bottomed frying pan so
  that when tested with a drop of water, it sizzles. Place the rotis,
  one at a time, in the pan and cook for a minute.  Turn, and spread a
  thin layer of vegetable oil on the face of each roti, and turn
  frequently until cooked- when brown flecks appear on the surface.
  Remove from frying pan and pound between the palms of the until it
  becomes supple. Keep rotis warm and moist by covering with a towel.
  Yields: 4-6 servings Notes from cookbook: Traditionally rotis are
  cooked on a flat iron grid called a tawa, but any heavy skillet or
  griddle can be used. If the roti is to be filled with any curried
  meat, poultry, or vegetable and eaten as a food, make 12-inch rotis.
  Place the filling in the center and fold in the edges. When they are
  to be served as a bread to dip up curries, chutney gravies, prepare
  8-inch rotis.

  Ed, first I peel and stuff the chicken with a small onion and a
  couple of garlic cloves, mashed; then after trussing and putting on
  the spit, I shake a little vermouth over it, then a little dark soy
  sauce, salt and freshly ground pepper lemon pepper if you have it,
  garlic powder, celery seeds, and LOTS of paprika; then I put on
  crushed oregano or basil onto the grill or in the oven/spit and cook
  until thigh juices run clear. The paprika is heavy enough to almost
  form a crust so the juices stay in the chicken..... My son who cooks
  this for his friends calls it 'Monogram O Chicken'... In fact, he
  cooked it one time on television in Fukui, Japan...but they never
  understood the reason for calling it 'Monogram O Chicken'!!!

      2 c  Garlic-minced
      1 x  Vermouth
      1 x  Soy sauce-dark
      1 x  Salt and pepper-fresh ground
      1 x  Garlic powder
      1 x  Celery seeds
      1 x  Paprika
      1 x  Oregano-crushed
      1 x  Basil
 
  Ed, first I peel and stuff the chicken with a small onion and a
  couple of garlic cloves, mashed; then after trussing and putting on
  the spit, I shake a little vermouth over it, then a little dark soy
  sauce, salt and freshly ground pepper lemon pepper if you have it,
  garlic powder, celery seeds, and LOTS of paprika; then I put on
  crushed oregano or basil onto the grill or in the oven/spit and cook
  until thigh juices run clear. The paprika is heavy enough to almost
  form a crust so the juices stay in the chicken..... My son who cooks
  this for his friends calls it 'Monogram O Chicken'... In fact, he
  cooked it one time on television in Fukui, Japan...but they never
  understood the reason for calling it 'Monogram O Chicken'!!!

      8 oz Plain (all purpose) flour
      1 pn Of salt
      6 oz Margarine
      6 tb To 8 tb cold water
 
  1. Sieve the flour and salt into a mixing bowl. 2. Cut the margarine
  into small pieces (size of a walnut). Add to the flour and toss
  lightly with the fingertips so that each piece of margarine is coated
  with flour - but not broken up. 3. Add 6 Tablespoons water and mix
  lightly with the blade of a knife into a soft dough, making sure that
  the pieces of margarine are kept whole.  If some of the flour is
  loose in the bowl, add a little more water and mix until it is worked
  in and the dough fairly soft. 4. Gather together with the fingertips,
  turn out onto a well-floured board and again sprinkle with flour. 5.
  Form into a small oblong, flour the rolling pin and roll lightly and
  carefully to a strip approximately 10 inches by 5 inches. 6. Brush
  off any surplus flour. Fold into three by folding the bottom third
  upwards and the top third downwards and over to cover it. 7. Lightly
  press the three open edges with the rolling pin to seal.
  
  Second Rolling:
  
  8. Turn the pastry round on the board so that the right hand edge
  faces you. Roll out to a strip approximately 9 inches by 6 inches. 9.
  Brush off any surplus flour. Fold into three again and seal the
  edges. Place on a floured plate; sprinkle with flour; cover with a
  damp cloth or plastic bag and leave in a cold place for 20 minutes.
  
  Third and Fourth Rollings:
  
  10. Repeat stages 8 and 9 for the third rolling (the resting period
  can be omitted) and again for the fourth rolling. (If the dough is
  streaky and rough in appearance, give it a fifth rolling. 11. After
  the last rolling and final resting, the pastry is ready to roll to
  the thickness stated in the recipe used.
  
  Following is the recipe for Eccles Cakes, using this pastry.

  From Peter Kelly of Piermont, N.Y.
  
  Turkey roulade: Remove skin from turkey breast with sharp knife.
  Slice in 4 slices. Between sheets of plastic wrap, lightly pound
  turkey cutlets into paillardes (thin sheets). Season with Kosher salt
  and pepper.
  
  Divide foie gras (or chopped liver) in 4 parts and season with salt
  and pepper. Place a piece of foie gras in center of each turkey
  paillarde and roll turkey around foie gras.
  
  Carefully remove cabbage leaves, one at a time, first removing core.
  Boil cabbage leaves in a large pot just until wilted, about 3
  minutes, and refresh under cold running water. Dry thoroughly.
  
  For each roulade, lay out 2 or 3 cabbage leaves to form a square.
  Place turkey roulade in center and wrap with cabbage, forming a tight
  bundle. Refrigerate. Sautene sauce: Over high heat, reduce 1 cup of
  sauterne and 1 cup of chicken broth until sauce coats back of spoon
  (about 12 minutes). Sprinkle in 1/3 cup sun-dried cherries.
  
  Crispy sweet potatoes: Peel potato and poach in boiling water until
  just tender, 12-15 minutes. Drain and slice very thin and then cut
  into julienne strips. In large saute pan, heat vegetable oil to hot,
  and fry potato strips for 1 minute, or until crisp. Pat dry with
  paper towels and toss with salt and pepper. To serve: Place roulades

           -Chopped
      3    Sprigs Parsley
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Butter
      2 tb Flour
 
  Pound steak to 1/4" thick. Cut into 6 rectangular pieces about 4
  inches wide and 8 inches long. Spread each with a teaspoon of
  mustard, sprinkle i with 2 teaspoons onion, and place a strip of
  bacon down the center. Cut pickles in half lengthwise. Place one half
  of a pickle across the short end of the rectangle. Roll meat up
  jellyroll style around the pickle to form a cylinder. Tie rolls at
  each end with kitchen cord.
  
  On medium high setting, heat the vegetable oil in a heavy 10 to 12
  inch skillet. Add the beef rolls and brown them on all sides,
  regulating the heat so they color quickly and evenly without burning.
  Transfer the rolls to a plate, pour the water into the skillet and
  bring it to a boil, meanwhile scraping in any brown particles
  clinging to the bottom and sides of the pan. Add the celery, leeks,
  parsnips, parsley, and salt. Return the beef rolls to the skillet.
  Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 1 hour, or until the meat
  shows no resistance when pierced with a fork. Turn the rolls once or
  twice during the cooking period. Transfer the rolls to a heated
  platter, cover with foil to keep them warm. while you make the sauce.
  
  Strain the cooking liquid left in the skillet through a fine sieve,
  pressing down hard on the vegetables before discarding them. Measure
  the liquid, return it to the skillet, and boil it briskly until it is
  reduced to 2 cups. Remove from heat. Melt the butter in a small
  saucepan over moderate heat, and when the foam subsides sprinkle in
  the flour. Lower the heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the
  flour turns a golden brown. Be careful not to let it burn. Gradually
  add the reduced cooking liquid, beating vigorously with a whisk until
  the sauce is smooth and thick. Taste for seasoning and return the
  sauce and the rouladen to the skillet. Simmer over low heat only long
  enough to heat the rolld through. Serve the rools on a heated platter
  and pour the sauce over them. Rouladen are often served with red
  cabbage and dumplings or boiled potatoes. NOTES : I sometimes make it
  as written, but often omit the parsnips, celery and leek. I also have
  a heavier hand with the onion. This recipe makes killer gravy for
  mashed potatoes.

  1 1/2 c  Thick Saltsa Aspri
    1/2 c  Grated mizithra cheese
           -OR- kefalotyri cheese
    1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
           Heavy greaseproof paper
           -(about 20 by 20 inches)
     12    Filo pastry sheets
    1/3 c  Butter or margarine
           - melted and warm
      2    Eggs, hard-cooked; sliced
      1 tb Chopped fresh parsley
 
  Heat the butter in a large frying pan, then saute the onion until
  soft. Add the meat, mashing it with a fork until the raw color
  disappears. Add the tomato and cinnamon, cover and simmer about 20
  minutes, stirring once or twice.  Remove the lid and season
  judiciously (if the cheese is salty, don't add salt until the very
  end). Stir in the basil, then remove the cinnamon stick and cool.
  Using a wooden spoon, mix the egg whites into the meat.  Meanwhile,
  prepare the saltsa aspri (it must be thick) and combine with the egg
  yolks, cheese, and nutmeg. Taste to see if salt is needed.
  
  To make the loaf, spread the baking paper flat on your work surface.
  Lay a sheet of filo (keeping the rest covered with a damp towel or
  waxed paper) in the center of the paper and brush with butter.
  Continue laying filo, one sheet on top of another, brushing each with
  butter, to make a large "base" on which to roll the meat loaf (about
  15 x 15 inches). Spread half of the saltsa aspri in the center of the
  filo, alowing wide margins for turning later.  Spread the meat
  mixture over the sauce to a length of about 9 inches. Lay the egg
  slices over the meat, cover with the remaining sauce, and sprinkle
  with parsley. Turn the edges of the filo up over the meat and roll
  into a loaf. Fold the paper over the loaf, secure it, and place, seam
  side down, in a baking pan.  Bake for 1 hour in moderate oven (350
  F), removing the paper after 35 minutes to allow the filo to get
  crisp. Brush the outer surface of the filo with butter or margarine
  for a higher golden chestnut color.
  
  With wide spatulas, lift the loaf onto a warm platter. Serve
  immediately, with fresh green salad, black olives, and a heady wine.

 Categories: Sauces, Cajun
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  All Purpose Flour
    1/2 c  Cooking Oil
 
   1. In a heavy skillet or 2 quart saucepan, stir together flour and
  cooking oil until smooth. Cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes
  then reduce heat to medium. Cook and stir about 10 minutes more until
  a reddish brown roux is formed. DARKER ROUX: 1. If you want a dark
  roux, prepare the roux as directed above, except cook and stir over
  medium heat about 15 minutes instead of 10 minutes or until a dark,
  reddish brown roux is formed.

      Title: ROUX FLOUR
 Categories: Cajun
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 c  All purpose flour
 
  This flour may be used in making that most basic of Cajun sauces, the
  roux. All Cajun recipies calling for a sauce begin with "First you
  make a roux". A normal roux is made with equal parts flour and oil,
  with water or stock added when the roux is at the desired degree of
  doneness. This flour allows you to dispense with the oil and still
  have the desired flavor.
  
  Place the flour in a large skillet over high heat; with a wire whisk,
  stir constantly for 25 minutes or until the flour begins to turn a
  light brown, similar to light brown sugar. If the flour begins to
  darken too fast, remove it from the heat and stir to allow the flour
  to darken evenly before putting it back on a lower heat setting.
  
  When it has reached the desired color, remove from the heat and
  continue stirring until completely cooled. Sift the flour into a
  covered container and store until needed.
  
  note:  This will tire you out and must be done with no interruptions.
  If the flour is burned, throw it out and start over. It is actually
  much harder than a true roux, but it is worth it to get the true
  flavor of the cajun dishes.

    1/2 c  Margarine
    1/2 c  Powdered milk
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Sugar
      1    Egg; beaten
      3 c  Whole wheat flour
 
  In a large bowl, pour hot water over margarine. Stir in powdered milk,
  salt, sugar and egg. Add flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after
  each addition. Knead 3 to 4 minutes, adding more flour if necessary
  to make a very stiff dough. Pat or roll to 1/2 inch thickness and cut
  out with a dog biscuit cutter. Place on a greased baking sheet and
  bake at 325 degrees for 50 minutes. Allow to cool and dry out till
  hard.
  
  I bake these on an ungreased 14 x 15 1/2 inch air bake pan which it
  *fills* using both large and small cookie cutters. They can be placed
  side by side since there is no rising. They slide right off onto an
  opened brown bag and cool and harden in no time.  I was advised in
  DOGHOUSE by a learned fellow that it might not be a bag idea to cut
  the sugar and salt quantities. Gotta watch their health too!
  Considering what's in the treats to be bought, these are considerably
  better for them.

  Cake ~--- Combine the cocoa and boiling water and set aside. Cream the
  butter, shortening, sugar, salt, and vanilla until fluffy. Add the
  eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir the soda
  into the buttermilk and add alternately with the flour to the creamed
  mixture.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 F. Prepare 3 9-inch cake pans by greasing them and
  lining them with waxed paper. Measure 1 2/3 cups batter into a small
  bowl and stir in the sour cream, maple syrup, and nuts. Pour into 2
  of the cake pans.
  
  Blend the cocoa-water mixture into the remaining batter and pour into
  the remaining pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes. Cool 5-minutes before
  removing from the pans. Spread Cocoa Maple Frosting between the
  layers, on the sides, and over the top of the cake.
  
  Cocoa Maple Frosting ~------------------- Combine the butter, cocoa,
  corn syrup, and maple syrup. Add the confectioners' sugar alternately
  with the milk. Beat until smooth and of a spreading consistency.

  half, salt and pepper and garlic powder. Bring to boil, reduce heat
  to simmer and cook, covered for 50 minutes, or until chicken tests
  done. Remove from heat and pull chicken from pot. When cool enough to
  handle, remove skin and discard. Remove meat and pull into serving
  pieces. Discard chicken bones and onion from pot.  Skim fat from the
  top of stock.
  
  Return chicken pieces to the pot of stock.
  
  Meanwhile, in a medium mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder and
  salt.
   Cut in shortening, and enough milk so that batter is smooth but not
  too runny.  Bring pot of chicken and stock to a simmer, then drop
  batter by spoonfuls into the hot liquid. Let cook 5 minutes,
  uncovered, then cover the pot and cook another 5-7 minutes, or until
  dumplings test done. Serve broth, chicken and dumplings in soup bowls
  and season to taste.

      Title: ROYAL FROSTING
 Categories: Cookies, Holiday
      Yield: 3 Cups
 
      3 x  Egg whites, room temp.
      1 lb Confectioner's sugar, sifted
           -about 4-3/4 c.
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/2 ts Cream of tartar
           Food coloring as desired
 
  Combine all ingredients in small, deep mixing bowl. Beat with electric
  mixer 7-10 minutes until frosting is very stiff. Divide into separate
  bowls and add food coloring as desired. Keep each bowl covered with a
  damp cloth -- this frosting dries quickly when left exposed to the
  air. Use pastry tube to decorate cookies as desired. Allow to dry
  before stacking. The thicker the design, the longer it will take to
  dry.
  
  This recipe is also good for making rosettes and other shapes. Larger
  shapes should be allowed to dry for several hours or overnight before
  being handled.  Use a little dab of additional frosting to *glue* in
  place on sides of cakes.

      3 lg Egg whites
    1/2 ts Cream of tartar
           Paste or powdered food
           -coloring (opt.)
 
  1. In medium-size bodwl, with electric mixer, combine sugar, egg
  whites, and cream of tartar just until well mixed. At high speed,
  beat mixture until thick and fluffy.
  
  2. Cover frosting tightly with a damp towel or plastic wrap while us-
  ing. If desired, to color frosting, divide into small bowls and mix
  in food coloring.
  
  Note: This frosting is used not only to decorate or spread onto
  cookies but also as an adhesive. Because of current health concerns
  about salmonella in raw eggs, frosting on cookies that will be eaten
  should be made from meringue powder instead of egg whites following
  package instructions. For purely decorative cookies, we prefer this
  egg-white frosting over the meringue-powder version because of its
  stronger gluing property.

      6 oz Instant vanilla pudding
  1 1/2 c  Water
      4 ea Jumbo eggs
    1/4 c  Salad oil

MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
      6 oz Crushed pineapple w/juice
      4 oz Instant vanilla pudding
    1/3 c  Light rum
      2 pt Whipping cream; whipped
           Coconut; for garnish
 
  Mix all cake ingredients for cake and divide into (3) 8 or 9 inch
  greased and floured cake pans and bake at temperature listed on the
  box. Divide each layer into 2 layers-so you end up with 6 layers
  total. Soak the pineapple with the rum for about 30 minutes. Mix in
  pudding and let sit until in a gelled state. Whip the two pints of
  heavy whipping cream, (put metal mixing bowl in freezer along with
  beaters before whipping for best results-I also put pints into
  freezer for several minutes before whipping too.) Whip cream until
  firm-watch it so it doesn't become butter-that's going too far! Then
  fold in the pudding mixture into the whipped cream-carefully. Toast
  the coconut in oven til lightly browned. Alternate layers of cake
  with layers of thick whipped cream. Garnish with toasted coconut and
  cover with plastic wrap tightly and place in refrigerator until the
  next day. I have found that if you do not wait and let these flavors
  meld for atleast 8 hours, you end up taking a bite of cake and
  frosting that has pieces of pineapple loaded with rum and just
  doesn't taste good

  minutes. Brush potato crust with oil, reduce oven temperature to 375
  degrees F. and bake for another 5-10 minutes, until crust is brown.

  butter. If you like a lot of onion and garlic, use more. Add broccoli,
  about 1/2 t salt, basil, a dash of thyme, and cook covered, stirring
  occasionally, for a few minutes.
  
  Spread half of cheese over baked crust.  Top with sauteed vegetables
  and remaining cheese.
  
  Beat together remaining 3 eggs and milk,  and pour over
  vegetable/cheese mixture.  Sprinkle paprika on top. Bake at 375
  degrees F. for 35 to 40 minutes until custard is set.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      4    Pieces Rudderfish
      1 tb Olive oil
      2    Cloves garlic, finely
           -chopped
      1 tb Chopped parsley
    1/2 c  Marsala
      1    Orange, juice and zest
    1/4 c  Fish stock
 
  Fish stock can be made when you have the time, frozen in ice- cube
  trays, then the cubes transferred to a freezer bag for storage until
  you need them. If worst comes to the worst, the Knorr brand has
  instant fish-stock cubes, which can often be found in the "exotic"
  section of large supermarkets.
  
  In a pan large enough to take 4 serving size pieces of rudderfish in
  one layer, heat a tablespoon of olive oil and gently fry 2 finely
  chopped cloves of garlic and a tablespoon of chopped parsley. Add
  half a cup of marsala. the juice and zest of an orange and a quarter
  cup of fish stock. Bring to a simmer and slide in 4 serving-size
  pieces of rudder fish. Poach just until the fish flakes, turning once
  if necessary, and remove the pieces to warmed plates. Turn up the
  heat to high and boil the liquid fiercely till it has reduced by at
  least half
  
  Pour the sauce over the fish and serve.

 Categories: Eggs, Cheese, Spicy
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      6 lg Eggs
    1/3 c  Beer
    1/2 ts Tabasco Pepper Sauce
      3 tb Butter
      3 tb Grated Parmesan Cheese
 
  More than a decade ago, Rudy Stanish, "the Omelette King" would turn
  out hundreds of omelettes at a time for charity functions. He always
  added Tabasco pepper sauce to his egg mixture, and over the years he
  cooked a bunch of omelettes for us on many occasions.  Rudy used beer
  as the liquid in this cheese omelette recipe, giving the eggs even
  more zip. ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs, beer and
  Tabasco sauce with a whisk only until blended, not frothy. In an
  8-1/2" omelette pan over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the
  butter.  The pan is hot enough when a drop of water spatters in it.
  Pour 1/3 of the egg mixture into the pan. Place one hand on the pan
  handle, palm down, and move the pan in a back-and-forth motion.  With
  the other hand, using a fork, stir the egg mixture in a circular
  motion, about seven times. Sprinkle the omelette with a tablespoon of
  the cheese.  To turn out the omelette, place your hand on the handle
  with palm upward.  Tip the pan and roll the omelette out onto a
  plate. Repeat twice with the remaining egg mixture. Serve with
  additional Tabasco sauce, if desired.  Frrom: The Tabasco Cookbook.

      Title: RUGALA  *** (KXTG24B)
 Categories: Cookies, Desserts, Jewish
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1 x  Filling:
      1 c  Ground pecans
      1 c  Currants
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 ts Cinnamon
      1 x  Dough:
      8 oz Cream cheese; room temperatu
      2 c  All purpose flour
      1 c  Butter; room temp.
      2 tb Sugar
      1 x  Flour
     12 oz Jar apricot jam
 
  For filling: combine pecans, currants, sugar and cinnamon in mixing
  bowl. For dough: combine cream cheese, flour, butter and sugar in
  processor or mixer and blend well. Divide dough into 4 pieces. Dust
  each with flour, shaking off excess. Roll each piece between sheets
  of waxed paper into 10" circle. Refrigerate 1 hour. Preheat oven to
  375. Grease baking sheets. Spread each circle of dough with apricot
  jam. Divide filling among circles, spreading evenly. Cut each into 12
  wedges. Roll up each wedge from bottom to point. Arrange on prepared
  sheets, point side down. Bake until golden, about 16-17 minutes.
  Transfer to wire rack and let cool. Store cookies in airtight
  container. Tips: Be sure to work on just one circle at a time and
  keep others refrigerated. Don't overdo the jam and cinnamon/pecan
  filling because they tend to overflow and will burn quickly on your
  baking sheets. Remove at once from the baking sheet to cool on racks
  when they turn golden brown on top. After rolling out between waxed
  paper, one hour of cooling is perfect to cut out, but they may be
  made ahead and refrigerated longer. Just leave them out a bit before
  cutting out so dough won't be so stiff to handle properly and roll
  well. P.S. I loved the directions, and the results. You know success
  when others ask for the recipe.

  until mixture resembles coarse bread crumbs. Cut in cream cheese until
  dough feels moist. Knead dough until you can gather into large ball.
  Divided into 8 pieces. Wrap individually and refrigerate at least 1
  hour or overnight. (Let dough stand at room temperature for about 15
  minutes before rolling)  In medium bowl combine brown sugar, cinnamon
  and cocoa. Stir in hazelnuts.  Set aside until ready to use. On
  lightly floured surface, roll each piece of dough into circle 10
  inches in diameter. Spread about 2 tbsp jam over each circle;
  sprinkle with some brown sugar mixture. Cut circle into 10-12 equal
  wedges. Roll up each one from outside, curving slightly to form
  crescent.  Place about 2 inches apart on greased or parchment lined
  baking sheet.  Repeat with remaining peices of dough. Beat together
  egg and salt and brush it onto each cookie. Sprinkle with coarse
  sugar or nuts. Bake in 350 F oven for 20-25 minutes or until golden.
  Makes 96 crescents.

      Yield: 2 Loafs
 
    1/2 c  Sour bread starter
      2 c  Warm water of potato water
  3 1/2 c  Rye flour
      1 pk Active dry yeast
      2 ts Salt
  3 1/2 c  Sifted white flour
 
  In large mixing bowl mix sour bread starter and 2 cups warm or potato
  water.  Blend in 1 cup rye flour. Cover lightly and let stand in a
  warm place for about 20 to 40 hours, depending on degree of sourness
  desired.
  
  Disolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm water, then stir into the soured
  mixture. Add the salt and very gradually beat in the remaining rye
  flour. Add the white flour a little at a time beating well after each
  addition. When a stiff dough is formed, let it rest for 10 to 15
  minutes. Turn onto floured board and knead until smooth. Place dough
  into slightly greased bowl turning to grease the top.Cover and let
  rise until doubled in bulk. Divide into two parts.  1/2 cup of the
  dough may be reserved for your next baking. Keep reserved dough in
  refridgerator in covered container.
  
  To make Eastern-Finnish style loaves, shape each of the two pieces of
  dough in to a ball and place on a lightly greased baking sheet. Cover
  and let rise until almost doubled, about 30 minutes.
  
  To make Western_Finnish style flat loaves, shape the dough into two
  balls and flatten the by patting to about 1" thick, keeping the shape
  round. With your fingers make a hole in the center about 2" in
  diameter. dust the top lightly with rye flour.  Place the rolls on a
  lightly greased baking sheet. Prick all over the top with a fork.
  Cover and let rise until about double in bulk, abouth 30 minutes.
  
  Bake in a 375 preheated oven for 45 minutes or until the loaves are
  lightly browned.
  
  Sour bread starter.
  
  About 2 days before making sour rye bread mix 1/2 cup milk with 1/2
  cup rye flour.  Milk must be at room temperature. Let stand uncovered
  in a warm place until the mixture begins to bubble and has a
  pleasantly sour odor. You may refridgerate at this point or use the
  entire amount immediately in a bread dough.

      1 c  Jicama, julienned
      1 c  Firm, ripe papaya in 1/2

    1/4 c  Brown sugar
      1 tb Tamarind paste dissolved in
           -1/2 cup water, strained
 
  Buried way down in my stack of papers I found an article from the SF
  Chron entitled "Sumatran Food++Hotter than Hot". Sumatra is close to
  Indonesia and the Malay peninsula and there seems to be some
  similarity between the cuisines.
  
  Cut the cucumber in half lengthwise, scoop out and discard the seeds.
  Cut the halves in 1/4-inch thick half moons. Mix the cucumber with
  jicama and fruit.
  
  Prepare a sauce in a processor; first process the peanuts to a crunchy
  consistency, then add the chiles, sugar and tamarind liquid. The sauce
  should have texture so don' over process. Toss the sauce and fruit
  together.
  
  Serve chilled or at room temperature as a snack, or with an
  assortment of Sumatra dishes.
  
  Serves 6.

  3. To avoid cracking on the top of the cheesecake: Place a pan of hot
  water on the floor of the oven during baking time.
  
  Check that your oven is NOT drafty.
  
  Check the accuracy of your oven temperature. A too-hot oven WILL cause
  cracks.
  
  DO NOT "peek" at the cheesecake during baking time.
  
  Use the proper size pan. If you use another size pan, adjust the
  baking time accordingly.
  
  DO NOT over bake. Baking time IS important.
  
  Run a spatula around the sides of the pan to loosen cheesecake
  immediately after baking.
  
  Cool the baked cheesecake to room temperature COMPLETELY before
  refrigerating. A hot, or even warm cheesecake, in the refrigerator
  WILL definitely crack.
  
  4. Even the non-amateur, following all the rules, will occasionally
  produce a cracked cheesecake. If so, simply cover the top of the
  cheesecake with one of your favorite toppings and pretend you didn't
  notice. The cheesecake will taste wonderful just the same. (I think
  that's why so many cheesecakes have toppings anyway!)

           Bittersweet chocolate shavin
           -s and curls
 
  Line a 9-inch pie plate with pastry, cover with foil and fill with
  rice. Bake the empty pie crust at 400f for 15 minutes. Remove rice
  and foil and bake at 375f for 10 minutes more or until it is pale
  golden. In a bowl with an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks.  Add
  the sugar gradually, beating until the mixture is thickened and pale.
  Beat in 1 cup of cream, rum, and 1/4 cup water.  Transfer the mixture
  to the top of a double boiler. Cook, stirring constantly until it
  registers 140f on a candy thermometer. Then cook for 3 minutes more.
  In a small saucepan, sprinkle the gelatine over 1/4 cup cold water.
  Let it soften for 5 minutes, and heat the mixture over low heat,
  stirring, until the gelatin is dissolved. Whisk into the custard, set
  the bowl in a larger bowl of ice water and let the mixture cool,
  stirring it occasionally, until it is the consistency of raw egg
  whites. Do not let the mixture set. In a bowl, beat the remaining
  cream until it just holds stiff peaks. Fold the whipped cream into
  the custard gently but thoroughly. Pour the mixture into the pie
  shell. Chill for 3 hours or until set. Garnish with chocolate curls.

 Categories: Historic, Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/3 c  Sweet or dry sherry or
           -Madeira
    2/3 c  Raisins
      2 lb Sweet potatoes, baked,
           -Boiled or steamed until
           -tender
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter, melted
      4 lg Eggs
      2 c  Milk
      1 c  Packed brown sugar
    1/2 ts Mace
           Pinch of salt
           Grated zest of 1 orange
      2 tb Lemon juice
    1/4 c  +1 tablespoon dark rum
 
  Pour the sherry or Madeira over the raisins in a small bowl; let
  stand for 30 minutes or longer.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375F., with a rack in the center. Butter an 11"
  oval gratin dish or other shallow baking dish; set aside.
  
  Halve the cooked sweet potatoes; scoop out the flesh and place it in a
  large bowl.  Add 1/4c +1 Tbsp of the melted butter. Add the eggs, one
  at a time, and beat with an electric mixer into the sweet
  potato-butter mixture. Add the milk, 1/3 cup of the brown sugar, the
  mace, salt and orange zest and beat until blended. Beat in the
  raisins and their soaking liquid. Scoop the mixture into the baking
  dish.
  
  Warm the remaining 3 tablespoons melted butter in a small skillet.
  Stir in the remaining 2/3 cup brown sugar and the lemon juice; cook
  over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until bubbly, 3 to 5
  minutes. Stir in the rum and return the mixture to a boil. Drizzle
  the rum glaze randomly over the surface of the sweet potato mixture.
  
  Bake until the pudding is set and the glaze is bubbly, and about 45
  minutes.  Serves 6-8.
  
                                          18th Century Recipe Note:
  This is a simple baked pudding with a base of mashed sweet potatoes.
  It has a wonderfully rich flavor. In colonial America, sweet potatoes
  were far more common than white ones. (Some recipes call for yams,
  with which sweet potatoes have become permanent confused. Virtually
  all of what we buy today, regardless of how they are labeled, are
  sweet potatoes. The confusion began when African-born slaves gave
  their native name -- yam -- to sweet potatoes.)
  
  Essentually a pleasant variation on the Thanksgiving classic that is
  often topped with arc-welded marshmallows, this pudding is not
  cloyingly sweet and allows the sweet potatoes own nice flavor to come
  through. Serve it warm, topped with whipped cream flavored with
  vanilla and dark rum.

      Title: RUM/BOURBON BALLS
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 2 Dozen
 
      3 c  Vanilla Wafers
           -(crushed)
      1 c  Sugar, powered
  1 1/2 c  Nuts, chopped
  1 1/2 ts Cocoa powder
      2 tb Corn syrup, white
           -(honey also works well)
    1/2 c  Rum or Bourbon
 
  Mix all dry ingredients and set aside.
  
  Mix corn syrup or honey with rum or bourbon to thin the syrup. Blend
  wet mixture into dry ingredients with fork. Mix well. Allow to sit
  for 1-2 hours.
  
  At this point, if you let it sit a couple of hours, you can come back
  and add another about 1/2 cup of rum or bourbon and let sit again.
  This process may be repeated a few times to your taste. The last
  time, the mix should sit a couple of hours so it's not really moist.
  There's a good midpoint between too moist and too dry where rolling
  into balls won't be difficult (too wet) or cause crumbling (too dry).
  
  Roll into balls, then roll in powered sugar to make a sugar coating.
  When rolling in powered sugar, the moister they are, the more sugar
  will be absorbed over time. They may need another roll in the sugar
  right before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Intoxicating chocolate snack with rum or bourbon -- I got this
  from my mom who uses more alcohol than the original recipe called for
  but less than I like to use. It makes a great party snack. Yield:

  latkes for Hanukkah. 1. Cook the noodles according to directions on
  the package and drain. Transfer to a large bowl and add margarine,
  blending well. Set aside. 2.  Saute the onion in 2 tbs vegetable oil,

      Title: RUMM BALLS
 Categories: Desserts, Holiday
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 c  Vanilla wafers crushed fine
      1 c  Walnuts chopped fine
      3 tb Corn syrup
    1/2 c  Rum
      3 tb Cocoa powder
      1 c  10x sugar
 
  Mix all ingredients except powdered sugar. I find that I have to add
  more rum to make the "dough" stick together. Roll into small balls
  about 1 inch in diameter. Then roll in powdered sugar.
   I usually double this recipe as these are eaten FAST! Put in tightly
  covered container and leave in a place where you won't be tempted to
  eat them for 3 weeks minimum. They can have a different flavor
  depending on the type/brand of rum you use.

  HOT CHILI TIPS: Throw out any chili spices over a year old.(The
  Reeds, who believe fresh spices are the major secrets to their
  success, buy only three months worth of spices at a time. And they
  date their spice jars.) For a smoother chili gravy, grind the spices
  in a coffee mill to make them finer. For a darker chili,add more
  paprika or chili powder. Combine chili powders,some dark,some medium.
  The Reeds order some of their chili powders and spices from Penderys
  in Dallas (800) 533-1870. But a lot of people cook with McCormick's
  chili powder, available at supermarkets, or bulk chili powders and
  peppers from Whole Foods. According to the Reeds, no one cooks
  competition chili in an iron pot anymore. Competitors tend to use
  other heavy saucepans, often Teflon lined to prevent burning. (The
  Reeds cook in Club Aluminum pots with a Siverstone lining.) If you
  are cooking chili outdoors, you have to take the elements into
  account. Wind will affect the amount of liquid in a pot of chili, as
  well as the cooking fire. Hot weather can affect a final recipe,
  because you generally need more salt to get a winning taste when the
  temperature is pushing 100. For cooking chili outdoors, cook over
  propane and use a heat distributor for even simmering.
