Oyster & Brie Soup

cheese, seafood, soups

2  sticks unsalted butter
1 cup celery, chopped
1 cup onion, chopped
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 lb brie cheese, cut into small
1  wedges, skin off
6 cup cold water
2 cup heavy cream
36  shucked oysters, with liquor
1/2 cup champagne
1/4 cup dry sherry

In a large soup pot, melt one stick of butter.  Add the celery,
onions, white pepper and cayenne.  Stir and cook over low heat until
vegetables begin to soften.

Over low heat in another pan, make a roux by combining 8 tablespoons
melted butter and the flour to make a base for thickening the soup.
Cook at least 2 minutes, stirring constantly, so the floury taste is
eliminated. Add the roux and the cheese to the soup pot. Add the
water, cream, oysters and their liquid. Simmer the soup until the
oysters begin to curl. Add the champagne and sherry and heat through.

Oyster Dressing (Paul & K's Recipe)

fish, poultry

3 lb oysters, small to medium; shucked, in their liquor
4 cup ; water
3/4 lb margarine
2 tablespoon margarine
6 cup onions; chopped, in all
4 cup celery; chopped, in all
4 cup bell peppers,green; chopped, divided
1 tablespoon garlic; minced
1 teaspoon garlic; minced
2 cup scallion; chopped, (tops only)
2 cup parsley, fresh; chopped very fine
8 small bay leaves
4 1/2 cup bread crumbs, very dry divided
4 tablespoon butter, sweet
      ----SEASONING MIX----
2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 teaspoon sweet paprika
2 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano leaves
1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves

Combine the oysters, oyster liquor, and water; stir and refrigerate at
least 1 hour.  Strain and reserve the oysters and 4 cups of the oyster
water separately; refrigerate again until ready to use

In a medium size bowl, combine the seasoning mix ingredients; mix
well. Set aside.

Place 1 stick plus 2 Tablespoosn of the margarine in a heavy 8-quart
saucepan or large Dutch oven over high heat. When margarine is half
melted, add 3 cups of the onions, 2 cups of the celery, and 2 cups of
the bell peppers; saute until onions are well browned, about 30
minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in 3 tablespoons of the
seasoning mix and the garlic. Reduce heat to low and cook about 4
minutes, stirring and scraping pan bottom occasionally.  Add the
remaining 2 sticks of margarine, 3 cups onions, 2 cups celery and 2
cups bell peppers, 1 cup of the green onions, 1 cup of the parsley,
and the bay leaves. Turn heat to high, stirring until margarine is
melted; cook until vegetables are tender but still a little crunchy,
about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Now stir in the reserved 4 cups oyster water and cook about 15
minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon
plus 1 teaspoon seasoning mix and enough bread crumbs (start with 4
cups, but you may need a little more) to make a fairly moist but not
runny dressing. Remove from heat.

Drain oysters well and stir them into the dressing. Spoon dressing
into an ungreased 15x11-inch baking pan (preferably not a non-stick
type) and bake uncovered in a 350 F oven until well browned, about 1
hour, stirring only after a dark crust builds (30 to 45 minutes).
Then remove from oven and stir thoroughly but gently so oysters won't
break apart, scraping browned parts from pan bottom and sides into
the mixture. Discard bay leaves.

Add the butter and the remaining 1 cup green onions and 1 cup parsley,
stirring well.  Serve as desired.

NOTE: Be certain to let the dressing cool, then refrigerate it and
chill it well before using it to stuff fowl.

Oyster Loaf - La M‚diatrice

main dish, seafood

1  french bread, 12 long
1/3 cup melted butter
1 pint shucked oysters, drained
1  tabasco sauce
1  hot heavy cream (optional)

Preheat oven to 425 øF. Cut off the top of the bread lengthwise,
scoop out most of the bread of the bottom half, leaving a shell about
3/4" thick. Brush the inside of the bottom and the cut side of the
top with melted butter. Put the loaf and "lid," cut sides up, on an
ungreased baking sheet, bake until toasted golden brown, about 20
minutes (the lid will be done first; check that it does not
overcook). Meanwhile, saut‚ the oysters in hot butter until plump.
Add salt, pepper, a dash of Tabasco, and, if desired, a little hot
cream.  Fill the loaf with the hot fried oysters and put the lid on
top. Heat for 10 minutes or until ready to serve. Cut in thick slices
if the loaf is long. NOTE: Individual rolls can also be used: allow
about 3 oysters for each one. The amount of oysters required for this
recipe varies according to the size of the oysters and the size of
the loaf of bread.  In any case, the bread "basket" should be filled
to the top with oysters.

10 1/2 oz grated coconut (unsweetened)
2 1/4 lb catfish fillet.
3 tablespoon finely sliced lemongrass.
1 tablespoon galanga, sliced thin.
1 tablespoon kaffir lime rind, sliced.
2 tablespoon cillantro roots.
2 tablespoon krachai, finely sliced.
20  fresh very hot thai chilli.
20  peppercorns
1/2 teaspoon salt.
4  onions, medium size.

9  dry red chilli, remove seeds
1/2 teaspoon coliander seeds.
1/2 teaspoon cumin.
3  mace.
2  cardamom
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg.

and squeezing out the coconut milk. You may also substitute an
equivalent amount of canned (unsweetened) coconut milk.
2. Cut the catfish fillet into medium size cubes (about 2" x 2").
3. Discard seeds from the dry chilli, and soak in cold water for at
least a half hour.
4. Separate about 1/2 cup of "cream" from the coconut milk, and heat
in a frying pan. Fry the catfish pieces in the coconut "cream" till
just cooked and put aside.
5. Put the following ingredients in a motar: salt, peppercorns, cumin,
coriander seeds, mace, cardamon, nutmeg. Pound till well mixed into a
fine pulp. Drain the dried chilli (discarding the water) and add to
the paste in motar. Continue pounding till the chilli pieces are
mixed in. Add lemongrass, galanga, kaffir lime rind, cillantro roots,
krachai, and fresh Thai chilli. Continue pounding until it's a fine
well mixed paste. (NOTE: You may substitute with an equivalent amount
of premade Thai "Red Curry Paste"). 6. Take the above curry paste
with the remaining coconutmilk, and fry over high heat till boiling.
Lower heat to medium and continue frying, with stiring, till oil
starts to form on top of the mixture. Add the cooked fish pieces and

Paella *** Guy --

ethnic, main dish, seafood

1 1/2 each shrimp; prawns - raw
1 1/2 each clams; live
3 lb chicken; - cut frying up and
1/3 cup olive oil
2 each lg onion; - chopped
4 cup garlic; mashed to a paste
1/4 teaspoon saffron; spanish
2 teaspoon salt
2 cup rice; uncooked
6 cup hot water
1 cup sweet red pimientos

OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS. 1/2     lb   chorizo sausages - casings removed
and meat crumbled then fried for about 15 mins. in separate pan.
Drain 3/4 lbs pork shoulder--cubed and well browned in separate pan.
Drop raw prawns into boiling salted water and cook until they turn
red. Drain, peel and dive in. Set aside. Scrub live clams in several
baths of cold water to be sure all the sand is washed away. Do not
open shells. Pour 1/2 of the olive oil into a frying pan and slowly
brown chicken pieces. Into a Dutch oven pour the remaining olive oil
and saute' the onions and garlic until tender but not brown over low
heat. Add prawns, clams, chicken, saffron, salt and rice (plus
optional if used. The more the merrier). Add water and simmer gently,
uncovered, until the rice is cooked. About 35-45 mins. If it becomes
too dry before the rice is cooked, a little more water may be added,
but DO NOT stir. If some moisture remains when rice is done, put pan
into a oven to dry out. Arrange strips of pimento on top and serve in
the pan in which it was cooked. The latter is why it is important to
carefully plan your cooking vessel. Hope you enjoy this. It comes
from Sunset Magazine who seem to always hit the target. BTW, I would
guess that the beans and peppers were used as fillers as generally
they are not mentioned in any recipe I have seen.

Palombo Coi Piselle

fish, italian

1  stephen ceideburg
3 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup minced onion
1 lb ripe tomatoes *
2 cup fresh or thawed frozen peas
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1  freshly ground pepper to taste
4  skinless leopard shark filets **
3 tablespoon chopped fresh mint leaves

* peeled, seeded, and chopped, with juice ** or small shark steaks (1
1/2 pounds in all)

This is a loose interpretation of a favorite Roman dish. Palombo is
the Italian name for a small shark related to leopard shark,
typically cooked and served with peas. This recipe makes just enough
sauce to moisten the fish; if you want to serve it over couscous, add
another cup or so of tomato juice.

Combine the oil and onion in a large skillet and cook over medium
heat just until the onion begins to color. Add the tomatoes, fresh
peas, salt and pepper and cook until the tomatoes release their
juice, about 5 minutes. (Wait to add thawed frozen peas until you add
the shark.)

Season the shark pieces with a little more salt and pepper and lay
them in among the vegetables. Cover and cook until the shark is
tender, 6 to 8 minutes depending on thickness. Transfer the fish to
warm plates, stir the mint into the skillet, correct the seasoning,
and spoon the sauce and peas over and around the fish.

Pan Fried Black Bass With Maitre D'hotel Sauc

seafood

      ----MAITRE D"HOTEL SAUCE----
1/2  clove garlic, smashed
1/4 cup butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon finely minced parsley
      ----THE FISH----
1/4 cup yellow cornmeal
4  1-lb. bass, dressed and
1  and skinned
1/4 cup flour
4 tablespoon butter
1  salt and fresh pepper

This recipe includes a very simple sauce that enhances sauteed,
broiled or baked fish.  It can be made in camp if you brought parsley
and usually impresses any old "fried fish angler."

Make the sauce first.
In a bowl set the butter out to soften.  Then cream it with a fork
and then a spoon until it is light and fluffy. Work in the salt and
pepper.
Mix the smashed garlic and the lemon juice, then work this liquid
into the butter.  Take a bit of time to do this.
Mix in the parsley and serve in a gravy boat with a spoon.
Pan fry the bass remembering to brown the fish on both sides but
not to over cook.
Serve hot on hot plates and pass the sauce.

Pan Fried Or Sauteed Yellow Perch

seafood

6 small yellow perch
1  7-9  long
4 tablespoon bacon fat or lard
1  salt and pepper
4 tablespoon butter
1  cornmeal
1  lemon (opt.)

Dress, scale, and what the fish, pat dry, salt and pepper, then
dredge them in the meal or meal-flour combination.
Heat the fat until it is hot enough to cook at once, but not
burning, sputtering hot.  Lay in the fish, turn heat down to barely a
medium flame, and begin to brown the fish. Keep the fish loose from
the pan bottom with a thin metal spatula.
Taking 8-10 minutes to a side (turn heat low if it seems to fry too
fast), brown the fish slowly until crisp. Do not overcook. When the
flesh is opaque the fish is done; one hopes it's all browned by then.
Add 4 Tbs. butter to the skillet after removing the fish and
squeeze in the juice of a lemon, stir the fat and juices to loosen
the dredgings, and pour over the browned fish.

VARIATION:  After removing the fish from the skillet, toss about 1/3
cup of chopped black walnuts.  Brown lightly with the remaining
butter and sprinkle over the fish before serving.

fish fillet into buttermilk, then into cornmeal mixture, coating
completely. Repeat process with remaining fish.  (Note from me: Let
fish stand for approximately 15 minutes before proceeding.) Melt
butter with oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add
fish and cook until crust is golden brown and fish is cooked through,
turning once, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer fish to platter.
Sprinkle with minced parsley. Garnish with lemon wedges.

NOTE:  If you let the fish sit coated for the 15 minutes that I
recommend, this dish will take 45 minutes. Believe me, let the fish
sit for the 15 minutes; it will keep the coating on the fish with no
hassle whatsoever.

1/4 cup corn or vegetable oil
8 tablespoon unsalted butter
6  lemon slices

well in the flour, shaking off any excess flour.

Heat the oil in a heavy nonstick frying pan or black steel pan over
medium-high heat and add the trout. Cook until golden brown, about 6
minutes on each side. Baste often to keep the trout moist.

Remove the trout to a warm platter.  Pour off the fat from the
frying pan and wipe it clean with paper towels. Return the pan to the
heat and melt the butter, shaking the pan and stirring until it turns
hazlenut brown. Do not let it burn.  Place a lemon slice atop each
trout. Sprinkle them with the lemon juice then pour the butter over
them. Garnish with the chopped parsley and serve immediately.

element. Place salmon fillets in the skillet, with the skin side
down. Sprinkle the other side of the fillets evenly with freshly
ground pepper. Cook without turning the fillets for around 6 minutes.

salmon is lightly browned. Don't let the salmon dry out. While
cooking the salmon, place wine in a small saucepan and simmer for
about a minute.  Add the minced chives, tarragon and butter. Stir
well. As soon as the butter melts, add the tomatoes for about 30
seconds.  Add salt and pepper to taste. Remove the tarragon. Spoon

Panko Shrimp

appetizers, foreign, seafood

1 lb shrimp (26 to 30)
2 cup panko (japanese breadcrumbs)
1 cup flour
2  eggs
1  oil for frying
1  lemon

Soy sauce for dipping

Peel and devein shrimp,but leave tails attached.Wash well in salted
water until water runs clear.This will be 5 or 6 changes of water.Dry
on paper towels. Beat eggs in a bowl.Pour flour and panko onto
separate pieces of waxed paper. Holding a shrimp by the tail,roll it
in the flour,egg and panko. Place on cookie sheet.Repeat with
remaining shrimp.This may be done several hours in advance,but keep
them in the refrigerator. Heat oil in a pan to 350 degrees.Deep-fry
shrimp until they turn light golden brown.You may need to do this in
several batches,because if you crowd out the pan,they will not brown
properly.Drain on paper towels. Cut lemon in half lengthwise,cut each
half in half.You will have 8 long wedges.Serve with soy sauce to dip
and lemon on side.You can squeeze the lemon either on the shrimp or
in the soy sauce or both.

Note:The Japanese eat a lot of foods at room temperature and fried
food coated with panko stays crisp for several hours,hence it is good
picnic food.This dish is served as an appetizer course in a Japanese
meal but would also make a good hors d'oeuvre at a Western-style
party.

Panned Fried Fish With Pecan Topping

seafood

      ----COATING----
1 cup pecan, pieces
1/2 cup butter, cut in 1 pieces
2 teaspoon juice, lemon
1/8 teaspoon pepper, red
1 teaspoon garlic, minced
1 teaspoon sauce, worcestershire
1/4 teaspoon salt
      ----FISH----
6 each fish, filets
2 cup flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon paprika, sweet
1/2 teaspoon pepper, black
1/8 teaspoon pepper, red
1  oil, vegetable
1  lemon wedges (garnish)

Coating: ========

Into a food processor place the pecans, butter, lemon juice,
pepper, garlic, Worcestershire and salt. Process until uniform.

Fish: =====

Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet to 350 F. Heat enough oil to
cover the fish filets half way.

Dredge the fish in flour.  Shake off any excess. Drop the fish
filets in the hot fat and fry for seven minutes on a side (depending
on the thickness of a fish.) The fish are done when they are opaque
and flake easily with a fork.

Assembly: =========

Place the fried filets on a broiler pan and cover with the pecan
topping.  Place the broiler pan in the oven about 6 inches away from
the flame and broil for up to a minute. The fat content is so high
here that you shouldn't leave the fish alone.  They will cook quickly
and there is always the potential for burning.

Serve hot on a plate garnished with lemon wedges and parsley.

Note 2: Concassé: Peeled, seeded tomatoes, chopped fine.

SAUCE: Combine the white wine, white wine vinegar, shallots, tarragon
stems, and cracked black pepper in a saucepan. Bring to a boil,
reduce to one-third the volume and strain. Stir the warm reduction
into the egg yolks and whip continuously over a double boiler until
thickened. Slowly add in the clarified butter, whisking constantly.
Add the cayenne, pepper, salt, all but 1/2 teaspooon chervil,
tarragon, lemon juice, tomato concassé, and avocados. Reserve the 1/2

plate in a curved rope-like presentation. Place a spoonful of the
mango and tomato salsa in the center of the plate, top with the
grouper and nap Choron sauce over half the fish. Sprinkle with 1/2
teaspoon reserved chervil.

Recipe from "The National Culinary Review", September 1997.

NOTES :     In 1980, as the captain of Team USA, he led the team into
its first gold medal in the hot food division of the International
Kochkunst Ausstellung, held in Frankfurt, Germany. Chef Friedenreich
says that victory, along with opening his own restaurant in 1979 and
passing his certified master chef exam five years ago, are the
highlights of his culinary career. Chef Friedenreich describes his
demo recipe -- pan-seared grouper with soft ancho polenta and avocado
sauce Choron -- as New World Cuisine. In it, he marries classical,
old world touches, with new world products and techniques. For
example, he prepares a traditional sauce Choron then embellishes it
with diced avocados.

1  egg white; stiffly beaten
1/4 cup chives; snipped
1 tablespoon parsley; minced
2 tablespoon grated parmesan cheese; or m

Combine the mayonnaise with the chives.  Fold 1/2 to 3/4 of the
beaten egg whites into the mixture to lighten the mayonnaise being
careful not to put in too much or the mixture will become loose.

Rinse the fillets in salted water and pat dry.  Place them on an
elevated rack in a large greased baking dish. Cover the fillets
evenly with the mayonnaise mixture; then sprinkle with Parmesan and
parsley. Bake in a preheated oven (425) for about 5 minutes or until
the topping is puffy. Finish the fillets by broiling until the
topping becomes a golden brown.

Garnish with lemon slices and serve with noodles accompanied by crisp
fresh leaf spinach cooked in butter and seasoned with a dusting of
nutmeg.

Serves 6.

Parmesan-Crusted Soft-Shell Crab Sandwiches

cheese, fish, sandwich

      ----YIELD: 8 SERVINGS----
2 cup flour
1 cup parmesan; grated
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
2  egg; lightly beaten
1/4 teaspoon tabasco
1 cup mayonnaise
1  lemon; juiced
1  zest of 1 lemon; finely grated
1/2 teaspoon garlic; minced
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1 tablespoon olive oil; extra-virgin
1 cup oil; for frying
8  soft-shell crabs; cleaned
8  rolls, hard; halved
2 medium tomatoes; thinly sliced
2  bn arugula; large stems removed

In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup of the flour with the Parmesan, salt
and pepper.  Make a well in the center and add the eggs and 1/4 cup
of water. Beat the eggs and water together and gradually incorporate
the flour mixture to form a smooth batter.  Add 1/8 teaspoon of the
Tabasco and set aside to rest for 30 minutes. In another bowl,
combine the mayonnaise, lemon juice, lemon zest, garlic, thyme, olive
oil and the remaining 1/8 teaspoon Tabasco. Whisk to blend and set
aside for at least 30 minutes. (The recipe can be prepared to this
point up to 1 day ahead. Refrigerate the batter and mayonnaise. If
the batter becomes very thick, thin it out with a little water.)
Preheat the oven to 250F. In a large skillet, heat the peanut oil
over moderately high heat to 350F. Dredge the crabs in the remaining
1 cup flour and shake off the excess. Dip 4 of the crabs in the
batter, let some of the batter drip off, and then fry them in the
skillet, turning once, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
Drain on paper towels, place on a heatproof platter and keep warm in
the oven. Repeat with the 4 remaining crabs. Scoop out some of the
bread from the center of the rolls to hollow them slightly. Spread 2
heaping teaspoons of the mayonnaise on each half. Assemble the
sandwiches by placing 2 or 3 slices of tomato and 4 or 5 arugula
leaves on the bottom half of each roll. Set the fried crabs on top
and close the sandwiches. Serve immediately. Serves 8. Recipe from
Food & Wine, June, 1991.

Pasta Cartoccio Frutta Di Mare

fish, pasta

1/2 lb shrimp -- shelled &
1  deveined
1/4 cup olive oil (plus oil for
1  greasing dish)
1 tablespoon shallots -- finely chopped
1 tablespoon garlic -- finely minced
1/3 lb sea scallops
1 cup red ripe tomatoes -- finely
1  chopped
1 cup fresh chicken broth or
1  bottled clam broth
2 tablespoon parsley -- finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon oregano
3 tablespoon cognac
4  littleneck clams
4  mussels -- well-scrubbed
1/4 lb lump crabmeat
1/3 lb perciatelli -- see note
1/3 lb mezza-lasagna -- see note
1/3 lb fettucine
10 small fresh basil leaves

STEP ONE: Cut the shrimp lengthwise in half. Cut each half crosswise.
Set aside. Heat the oil in a skillet and add the shallots and garlic.
Cook, stirring, about one minute. Add the shrimp and shallots and
cook, stirring, about one minute. Add the tomatoes and broth and
bring to a boil. Let simmer about one minute and add the parsley,
oregano, and Cognac.

STEP TWO: Add the clams and mussels and cover closely. Cook until the
clams and mussels open, about one and a half minutes. Add the crab
meat, stir gently, and remove from the heat.

STEP THREE: Bring four quarts of water to a boil and add the
perciatelli. Cook, stirring down with a fork, about one and a half
minutes, and add the fettucine and the mezza-lasagna. Continue
cooking about six minutes.

STEP FOUR: Meanwhile, spread out on a flat surface a sheet of
aluminum foil measuring about 17 by 30 inches. Fold the foil over
itself to make a rectangle measuring 15 by 17 inches. Fold over the
open edges to seal. Drain the pasta and place it in the foil bag.
Pour the sauce with the seafood into the bag. Scatter the basil
leaves on top of the pasta and sauce. Fold the open end of the foil
to seal it all around hermetically.

STEP FIVE: Lightly oil the bottom of a metal, flame-proof dish or
baking sheet and place the pasta-filled foil bag on top. Turn the
burner to high. Cook for about two minutes, until the bag puffs like
a pillow.

STEP SIX: To Serve-- Using a sharp knife, cut a long slit on one side
of the bag. Divide the pasta and seafood among four heated dishes.

CHEF'S NOTE: If perciatelli or mezza-lasagna are not available,
substitute equal amounts of fettucine and cook for nine to twelve
minutes.

Pasta With Cilantro Cream Seafood Sauce

fish, pasta

40  steamer clams, about 2
1  pounds
1 lb medium raw shrimp
8 oz rotelle, fettucine, or your
1  favorite pasta
3 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
2 oz parmesan cheese
1 small bunch cilantro, large stems
1  removed -- (about 1
1  cup)
1/2 cup fresh basil leaves
2 tablespoon fresh ginger -- finely
1  minced
2/3 cup chicken stock
1/4 cup dry sherry
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon asian chile sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup whipping cream

Advance preparation: Scrub the clams and refrigerate. Shell, devein,
and split the shrimp nearly in half lengthwise. In separate
containers, set aside the pasta, oil, and cheese. To make the sauce,
place all the sauce ingredients except the cream in an electric
blender and blend at the highest speed until completely liquefied.
Transfer to a container, stir in the cream, and refrigerate. All
advance preparation steps may be completed up to 8 hours before you
begin the final cooking steps. Final cooking steps: Grate the cheese,
about 1/2 cup. Bring 4 quarts of water to a rapid boil.

Lightly salt the water, then cook the pasta according to the
instructions on the package.  When the pasta loses its raw taste but
is still slightly firm, remove from the heat and drain. Meanwhile,
place a small colander lined with cheesecloth in a bowl.  Place a 12-
or 14-inch saute pan over high heat.  Add 1/4 inch of water. When the
water comes to a rapid boil, add the clams, cover and steam until all
the clams open, about 1 to 2 minutes.  Immediately tip the clams into
the colander lined with cheesecloth.  Then add 3/4 cup of the
clam-steaming water to the cilantro sauce. Return the empty saute pan
to high heat. Add the olive oil. When the oil becomes hot, add the
shrimp. Stir and toss until the shrimp turn white. Add the cilantro
sauce. When the cilantro sauce comes to a boil and thickens slightly,
add the clams (but not the remaining liquid in the bowl) and combine
evenly with the sauce. Place the pasta on a heated platter or 4
heated dinner plates.  Spoon the seafood and sauce on top of the
pasta. Sprinkle with cheese and serve at once. Suggested
Accompaniments: Green bean and walnut salad and a ginger-praline
mousse.

Pasta With Crab & Avocado Sauce

fish, pasta

1  stephen ceideburg
1 small onion
1  piece of fresh ginger, 1 cm grated
1/2 tablespoon olive oil
150 ml fish stock
60 ml dry sherry
1  salt to taste
1  cayenne to taste
1 large avocado
1/2  lemon, juice only
300 gm crabmeat
1  cooked pasta for four

If you don't want the trouble of dismantling crabs to obtain the crab
meat, use frozen meat. Canned crab meat is very poor by comparison.
And if you haven't time to make fish stock, chicken stock can be
substituted at a pinch, though the result won't be quite as good.

Boil a large pot of water and cook enough pasta of your choice for 4.
Meanwhile, chop a small onion, grate a centimetre or so of fresh
ginger and simmer them gently in 1/2 tablespoon olive oil until soft.
Add 150 mL fish stock and 60mL good quality dry sherry plus salt and
cayenne pepper to taste. Mash or process together the flesh of 1
large avocado and the juice of half a lemon. Add the avocado to the
fish stock together with 300 g of crab meat, and stir well, leaving
the sauce on the heat just long enough to heat through. Taste and
adjust the seasoning. and add more lemon juice if necessary. Serve
over the hot pasta.

Patout's Boiled Crawfish

cajun, fish, main dish

      ----FOR THE BOIL----
40 lb live crawfish
1 cup salt
1/2 cup ground white pepper
1/2 cup ground red pepper
1/2 cup ground black pepper
5 lb small white onions
12 each ears of corn, shucked
5 lb small new potatoes
      ----SPRINKLE----
1/2 cup ground white pepper
1/2 cup ground red pepper
1/2 cup ground black pepper
2 cup salt

Alex Patout describes Crawfish as "a delicacy made for sharing-- in
fact, in Cajun country, boiling crawfish for only two people counts
as a venial sin." Wash the crawfish well and pick out any fish bones
or other debris. Fill a great big (40-quart) Stockpot a quarter full
of water. Add the salt and peppers and bring to boil. Add the whole
onions, the corn, and the new potatoes (it will be easy to remove
them later if you put them in a cloth sack).  Return to boil, cover,
lower heat to medium, and let cook for 8 minutes.  Add crawfish,
cover again and raise heat to high. After steam begins to escape from
under the lid, cook 7 minutes more. Remove from heat and let sit for
4 minutes. Do *NOT* remove the lid until this point!
Remove the onions, corn, and potatoes to a bowl and drain the
crawfish. Place the crawfish in a large insulated container (an ce
chest works well, as do the thick waterproof boxes chickens are
shipped in, which your butcher may give you for free).  Have your
*SPRINKLE* ready and sprinkle over the crawfish and mix them well to
coat. Cover and let sit for 7 minutes.
Serve immediately with the onions, corn, new potatoes, and lots of
French bread on a large table covered with plenty of paper. When
everyone has eaten his fill, everyone "peels for the house." The
peeled tails can then be used in cold crawfish cocktail or salad or
for Fried Crawfish the next day. Serves 8-10 NOTE: Most of the salt
is not added until after the cooking process because too much salt
added during cooking makes the flesh of the crawfish adhere to the
shell. From Alex Patout's "Cajun Home Cooking" -- Random House

Peanut Crunch Alaska Halibut

fish

4  (4-6 oz's. each) alaska halibut ste; aks, thawed if necessary
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup lime or lemon juice
2 tablespoon honey
1 cup crushed corn flakes

Mixing well-loved flavors such as peanut butter with less familiar
flavors such as fish makes fish more acceptable to children.
Marinating the halibut for 4-6 hours before cooking enhances the
peanut flavor without adding work. Alaska halibut is a mild flavored
whitefish with a firm, meaty texture that appeals to all ages.

Cut center bone and skin from halibut steaks and cut into 1-inch
chunks. Place peanut butter, soy sauce, lime juice and honey in
blender. Blend until smooth. The mixture should be thick. Place
peanut butter mixture in a glass dish and roll each halibut chunk in
mixture, evenly coating all sides. Then roll halibut chunks in
crushed corn flakes to coat. Place on a greased baking sheet and bake
in upper half of oven at 450" for 3-5 minutes, or until fish just
flakes when tested with a fork. Makes 4-6 From the files of Al Rice,

Peanut Shrimp Chili

1 cup cooked white kidney beans
1/4 cup peanut butter
3  minced cloves of garlic

1 teaspoon dried dill
2 tablespoon chili powder
1 cup clam juice
2 teaspoon tomato paste salt and pepper to tas; te

Cook onion in oil until soft and translucent; add the minced garlic
and cook, stirring all the while, for about a minute. Don't let the
garlic burn. Add cumin, dill, oregano, ginger and chili powder and
cook, stirring all the while, for about 2 minutes more.  Add the
shrimp and then quickly add the clam juice, water and tomato paste (I
mix them together as part of the prep, then add them to the pot).
Quickly stir in the beans, season to taste with salt and pepper (I
use no salt and a "pepper melange" of green, pink, white and black
peppercorns). Increase the heat and, as soon as the mixture starts to
boil, remove from heat, whisk in the peanut butter, adjust seasoning,
and serve over rice.

pecans, to a completely different effect.

Cut catfish into 1/2x2" fingers. Brush with brown mustard and honey.
Dredge in a mixture of pecans ground with seasoned bread crumbs and
set aside. Saute potato in peanut oil until crisp and brown and drain
on paper towels. Add oil to pan amd saute fish until it flakes to the
touch. 4-5 minutes per side. Serve fish with the chips and orange
wedges.

Peg Jenning's Whiskey-Flavored Crab Soup

seafood

      ----EPICUREAN DELIGHT: BEARD----
      ----SOUP----
1 lb crab meat
1/2 cup milk
2 tablespoon butter
      ----CREAM SAUCE----
3 tablespoon butter
3 tablespoon flour
2 cup milk
1 1/2 cup cream, heavy
4 tablespoon scotch whiskey

Heat crabmeat in milk and butter.  Make cream sauce by cooking butter
and flour together slowly for 2 minutes, then whisking in milk, and
salt and pepper to taste. Bring to boil and whisk until smooth. Add
cream; stir in crabmeat as soon as it simmers.  When it is just at
boiling point, stir in whiskey.  Serve in heated cups with a
sprinkling of parsley.

No good cook is above profiting by another's mistakes. When his
friend Mrs. Jennings added a splash of Scotch instead of using sherry
in the crab soup she made for him, Beard didn't object to the flavor
but did add her recipe to his lifetime collection.

Peppery Coconut Baked Fish With Chutney Sauce

fish, main dish

3 tablespoon oil
1/2 cup butter, melted
3 tablespoon orange juice
2 tablespoon lemon juice
2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoon ginger
2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 cup plain bread crumbs
1 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut
8  6 oz fish fillets (red
1  snapper, bass, turbot, or
1  orange roughy)
      ----FOR SAUCE----
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup chutney (like mango)
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon curry powder

Heat over to 425 degrees and pour oil into 13x9 baking pan (or spray
with Pam); tilt pan to coat evenly. In shallow bowl, mix butter,
orange juice, lemon juice, garlic powder, ginger, red pepper flakes.
Salt and pepper if desired. In shallow bowl, combine coconut and
bread crumbs. Dip fish in butter mixture and coat with bread crumb
mixture. Bake at 425 for 5 minutes. Turn fillets over; sprinkle with
remaining mixture. Bake an additional 10-15 minutes or until fish is
golden brown and flakes easily. Mix all sauce ingredients. Serve
sauce over fish, garnish with lemon and parsley.

Variation: 1-1/2 lbs of peeled, deveined, butterflied shrimp can be
substituted. Combine the butter, orange juice, lemon juice, garlic
powder, ginger and pepper flakes in a bowl. Add 1 tsp of coconut
extract if you don't have coconut. Put the butterflied shrimp in the
butter mixture and transfer to plain bread crumbs and toss to coat.
Turn shrimp into a "Pam" sprayed pan, separating the ones that
"hunked" together, then into the 425 oven for 5 minutes...flip with a
spatula and another 10 minutes in the oven. If you don't have
chutney, add extra lemon juice...it turns out fine.

Pescado En Mojo De Ajo (Fish In Garlic Sauce)

fish, mexican

1  skinless fillets of any
1  mild white fish
1  flour
1  clarified butter
1  a lot of garlic)
1  juice of one lime
1  additional lime wedges

Use only Clarified butter (don't think of using margarine)

Dust the fillets lightly with flour.  Meanwhile, heat some of the
clarified butter in a frying pan until hot but not smoking. Saute the
fish until lightly browned (some Mexican cooks fry fish until it is
the approximate consistancy of our potato chips <crisps>, but I feel
this is taking authenticity a bit too far
:-).

Remove the fish from the pan, and add additional butter if needed
(you will want about 2-3 Tbsp. of melted butter per fillet to sauce
the finished dish). Add garlic to the pan and saute garlic until it
is a light brown color.  Do not allow it to burn, but do allow the
garlic to take on some color and become slightly crisp. Squeeze in
the lime juice.

Pour the hot butter/garlic mixture over the fish, and serve.

This dish is quite common in Southern Mexico, and traditionally would
be served with black beans (either whole or refried); perhaps a
simple dish of rice, cooked in chicken broth with chopped cilantro
and a few diced green chiles; a side relish of homemade fresh salsa
(see Pico de Gallo).

mexican, seafood

2  groupers or red snappers (about 2 1; /2 pounds each)

Yield: 6 servings

_One_day_ahead_:

Do not have the scales removed from the fish.  Have the heads and
tails removed and the fish opened out flat in one piece. Remove the
backbone. 1 tablespoon ground achiote (annato) seeds Available in the
Latin American food section of most supermarkets and Latin American
and Carribean markets. 1/4 teaspoon peppercorns 1 1/2 teaspoons salt,
or to taste 1/4 teaspoon oregano, lightly toasted in a small frying
pan 1/4 teaspoon hot paprika 3 cloves garlic, peeled 1/4 cup Seville
orange juice, or mild white vinegar

In a blender or food processor, blend all the ingredients together to
a smooth paste.  Spread the paste over the flesh of the fish and set
it aside to season for several hours of every night.

_On_serving_day_:

Brush the seasoned side of the fish with a little olive oil and cook
it, seasoned side down, over the charcoal or under the broiler for
about 10 minutes.

Turn the fish over and cook it on the skin side for a slightly longer
period or until the flesh is _just_ cooked through - about 15 to 20
minutes, depending on the fish.

Serve the fish hot with fresh tortillas, so that everyone can make
his own tacos, with small dishes of the following served separately:

Toasted oregano Chopped chiles habaneros or cayennes Sliced avocado
Pickled onion rings (does anybody really want this recipe!?) Sliced
tomato Sliced Seville oranges

still haven't found a good wok for Alison, but the sales are really
picking up again now that spring is here.

Stumbled across this recipe in one of the books and thought it might
be of at least passing to ya...  ;-} Maybe make it with some nice
fresh salmon?

Season fish with salt, pepper, and tarragon leaves and soak in lime
juice for a few minutes.  Set the oven at 375F and bake fish in
buttered baking dish until it flakes easily when pierced with a fork,
about 25 minutes.

While fish is baking, combine tomatoes, parsley, avocado, garlic,
minced onion, oil chili powder, salt and pepper to taste. (We suggest
tasting the guacamole as the chili powder is added, so that you can
get just the degree of heat you desire.)

Spread the above mixture over the cool fish.  Garnish with black olive
rings and strips of sweet red pepper.

Makes 6 to 8 servings.

minutes. Drain and set aside.

several hours ahead of using it; then mix again energetically.) You
can store it, covered, in the refrigirator for up to a week. Be sure
to bring to room temperature or even a little warmer before use.

Heat the cooked, drained fennel in a 375 oven for about 20 minutes.

Pickled Salmon ("Emel Style" - Pat & Joe)

fish

1  ingredients for brine:
2 cup cider vinegar
1/2 cup water
3/4 cup sugar
3 tablespoon pickling spice

SALTING: Cut salmon pieces approx. 4" wide. Put salmon pieces in a
crock or suitable container skin side down, layering salt and fish.
Be sure to use plenty of salt. Use a weighted dish on top of the fish
to keep the salmon submerged in the brine; thirty days minimum for
curing. Keep watch for oil scum on surface - remove scum with paper
towels. Occasionally a mold will occur. If this happens it will be
necessary to rebrine. Dump out all of the old brine and clean off
fish. Rebrine by using at least a quart of rock salt to a gallon of
water. (Don't spare the salt. Be sure the brine covers all of the
fish.) During the above operation the fish can be kept at outside
temperature ~ cool place - not necessary to refrigerate. The fish in
this state can be kept for several months. FRESHENING: Put the fish
in a container of fresh cold water. Rinse thoroughly two or three
times a day for 2 days, or until salty taste is right for you. Keep
refrigerated. Skin the fish and cut into the size pieces you prefer
for eating. Remove the bones; fish is now ready for the pickling
process. PICKLING: Make enough brine to cover fish, using above
ratios. Bring brine ingredients to a boil until sugar is dissolved.
Set aside to cool. Layer salmon and sliced onions in a container. (If
you like pickled onions use plenty of them!) Pour cold brine over
fish until covered completely. Let stand for at least a couple of
days and then fish can be eaten. Note: You can put the fish in a
smaller container, not necessary to refrigerate. We use 1 gallon
containers when we pour pickling mixture on the fish. Then after a
couple of weeks we put the fish into pint jars. NOTES

Pike In Galentyne

main dish, medieval, seafood

3 lb middle cut of pike
1  or similar large fish
1 1/4 cup white wine
2 tablespoon white wine vinegar
3  parsley stalks
1  salt
3  slices brown bread
1  crusts removed
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper
4 oz onions, peeled and chopped
1  oil for frying
1  gelatine (optional)

Put the fish in a pan, add the wine, vinegar, parsley stalks and
enough salted water to cover the fish and poach gently for 15
minutes. Turn off the heat; if necessary, the fish will finish
cooking in the liquid as it cools.  Cover the pan and cool to tepid
before finishing the dish.

Carefully lift the fish out of the pan.  Reserve the cooking liquid.
Put the bread in a bowl and add enough of the liquid to cover it.

Skin the fish and take out the spine and other bones; pike has a line
of thin bones through the middle of the body flesh on each side. Cut
all the flesh into small pieces both to get at them and to make a
manageable dish.

Strain the remaining cooking liquid into a clean pan. Put 425 ml/15
fl oz/2 cups of it into an electric blender with the soaked bread,
cinnamon and pepper; process until smooth. Return the mixture to the
liquid in the pan. Fry the onions in a little oil until soft, and add
them to the liquid too. Taste for seasoning, add the pieces of fish
and re-heat gently to serve.

If you want a cold dish, keep the fish pieces and fried onions aside
while you measure and taste the liquid, then re-heat it with enough
gelatine to stiffen it; if you had cooked a whole fish, it would have
jellied without help.  Add the fish pieces and onions, turn into a
mould and leave to set in the refrigerator. Auter pike in Galentyne.

Pilafi Me Mythia (Mussel Pilaf)

greek, seafood

1  karen mintzias
1 1/2 kg fresh mussels
1  water
1  salt
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup butter
1 large onion; finely choppped
1/2 cup dry white wine
1  freshly ground black pepper
2 cup short grain rice
1/4 cup chopped parsley
1  parsley sprigs, lemon wedges

Serves: 6 Cooking time: 45 minutes

Scrub mussels with a stiff brush, scraping shells with a knife blade
to clean them thoroughly.  Tug beard towards pointed end to remove.
Place in a bowl of lukewarm salted water until mussels open. If any
are open to begin with, tap shell - if mussel does not close, then
discard it. While mussels are open, run lukewarm water into the bowl
so that any sand can be expelled from the mussels.  Drain.

Heat oil and butter in a deep pan and add onion.  Fry gently until
transparent.  Add mussels, cover pan and cook for 5 minutes until
shells open.  If any do not open, then discard them. Add 3 cups cold
water, wine, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and pepper to taste.  Cover pan and
bring to a slow simmer.  Simmer gently for 10 minutes, then remove
mussels with a slotted spoon.

Wash rice until water runs clear, then add to liquid in pan with the
parsley.  Bring to the boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat,
cover pan tightly and cook over low heat for 15 minutes.

Pix Rowe Miller's Family Fish Chowder

fish, soups

6 slice bacon -- 1/4 thick
3 cup diced yellow onions
6 medium potatoes -- peeled
1 lb haddock
1 lb cod
2 can evaporated milk -- (3 cups)
1 cup whole milk
1  salt
1  freshly ground pepper

Fry the bacon, remove from the pan, and place on a paper towel. Saute
the onions in the bacon fat and set the pan aside. Cut the potatoes
in half the long way, then into 1/4" slices. Put them in a
nonreactive pot large enough for the chowder. Cover the potatoes with
water and boil until tender. Becareful not to put in too much water
or the chowder will be soupy. While the potatoes are cooking, cut the
fish into generous bite-sized pieces. When the potatoes are ready,
add the fish to the pot, cover and simmer until the fish flakes. When
the fish is done, crumble the bacon and add it to the pot along with
the onions and any grease in the pan, the evaporated and whole milks.
Bring the mixture to boil, cover, and turn the heat down. Simmer for
five minutes and add salt and pper to taste. Chowder invariably
tastes better when made a day ahead.

According to Katherine Hall Page.... The Rowe recipe may be happily
modified in all sorts of ways. The chowder is still quite delectable
with olive oil instead of bacon fat. You may also use salt pork. Two
kinds of fish make for a more interesting chowder, but these can be
any combination of the following: haddock, cod, pollack, monkfish and
hake. Finally there is the question of garnishes: dill chopped
parsley, oyster crackers, butter are all good. And Faith and Pix's
friend on Sanpere, Jane Weiss, swears by her chowder to which she
adds curry spices!

Pla Preeo Wan (Sweet & Sour Flounder)

asian, seafood

3 cup diced peeled ripe pineapple
2 cup diced, peeled and seeded cucumber
2 cup diced, cored and seeded ripe plum t; omatoes
1 cup diced onions
1/4 cup pineapple juice
4  garlic cloves, finely minced
2 tablespoon finely minced fresh ginger
1  salt to taste
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1/2 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro lea; ves

From "Sheila Lukins All Around the World Cookbook" (Workman, $27.95
cloth, $18.95 paper).

While I was in Southeast Asia, I tasted a wonderful broiled flounder,
topped with a sweet-and-sour sauce of pineapple, cucumber, tomato and
onion. For spice, I've added lots of fresh ginger and garlic. Serve
the fish in shallow bowls, with the sauce ladled atop.

1. Carefully remove any tiny bones from flounder with a tweezer. Set
fish on a broiler tray lined with aluminum foil. Preheat broiler.

2. Combine diced pineapple, cucumber, tomatoes, onions and pineapple
juice in a heavy saucepan. Simmer over medium-low heat for 5 minutes,
stirring occasionally.

3. Reduce heat, add garlic and ginger, season with salt and continue
cooking for another 5 minutes.

4. Remove 1/4 cup of liquid from saucepan and mix it with cornstarch
until smooth. Stir back into saucepan and cook, stirring, 2 minutes
more to thicken fruit sauce slightly. Remove from heat; set aside.

5. Brush fish fillets with olive oil and drizzle with lime juice.
Sprinkle with salt. Place fish 4" from heat source and broil 4-5
minutes, or until fish is opaque and flakes easily. Remove, cut in
half crosswise and place one piece of fish in each of 8 shallow bowls.

6. Heat fruit sauce for 1 minute over medium heat, stir in cilantro
and ladle evenly over fish. Serve immediately.

Plan Samli Daet Diao (Fried Sun-Dried Kingfis

seafood, thai

1  kingfish, weighing 1 to 1 1/2 lbs.
1 tablespoon finely sliced shallot
2 tablespoon shredded green mango
1 teaspoon shredded hot chilli
2 tablespoon fish sauce
3 tablespoon lime juice
1 teaspoon palm sugar
2 cup cooking oil

Snagged an excellent new Thai cookbook yesterday. It's "The Elegant
Taste of Thailand, Cha Am Cuisine" by Sisamon Kongpan and Pinyo
Srisawat. SLG Books, Berkeley and Hong Kong, 1989. ISBN
0-943389-05-4. This is a big, well-illustrated-with-color-photos
book. Mike hauled it home yesterday with another one, "Keo's Thai
Cuisine". (Being no dummy, he realizes that new cookbooks inspire me
to cook so every so often he'll grab something for me to avoid having
to cook himself.) But it wasn't that simple. He'd bought them both,
but intended to keep one and send one on as a thank-you gift to a
fella that took him and Laurie sailing a couple of weeks ago.

"You get to choose one to keep." The dreaded words...

I paled, started to shake.  Sweat beaded my brow.  I grabbed the
fanciest one++the hardbound "Keo's" book++and paged through it, awed
by the illustrations, impressed by the recipes. Then I grabbed
"Elegant Taste" and started on the first page, intending to skip
through it. Instead I went through the entire book, page by page,
from start to finish. I slammed it shut.  "This one."

"Elegant Taste" explains Thai ingredients (and gives both the Thai
names and spells them out using the Thai alphabet), makes sensible
recommendations for substitutions and has relatively simple but very
good and authentic looking recipes, each of which is illustrated by a
beautiful color photo.  This can be really helpful when one is
cooking a new dish and isn't sure of what it should look like and
what garnishes to use. Garnishes are particularly important in Thai
cooking as they're meant to be eaten with the dish but often are not
referred to in the recipe. For instance, in the following recipe the
dish is presented on a platter with a half dozen or so scallion
brushes and tomato slices, neither of which are referred to in the
recipe.

As for this recipe, some of you might remember a while back when I was
raving about a dried, fried fish dish I'd had in a Thai place, but
couldn't find in a cookbook. It was in "Elegant Taste" and here it
is. Wash, clean and butterfly the fish leaving the two sides joined
along the belly. Open the fish out flat so that the skin is downward,
remove the bones, and score the flesh with a knife.

After allowing it to dry, lay the fish opened out flat in strong
sunshine for five to six hours, turning regularly so the sun strikes
both the skin side and the interior.

Pour the oil into a deep frying pan and place on medium heat. When
the oil is hot, place the fish, still opened out, in the oil. When
the lower side becomes crisp and golden, turn the fish and continue
frying until it is done on both sides; then, remove from the pan,
drain, place on a serving dish.

Toss the shallots, mango and chilli together, seasoning with fish
sauce, lime juice and palm sugar so that a sour taste is the
predominant one. Spoon into a bowl and serve with the fish.

Serves two to three.

From "The Elegant Taste of Thailand, Cha Am Cuisine" by Sisamon
Kongpan and Pinyo Srisawat.  SLG Books, Berkeley and Hong Kong, 1989.
ISBN 0- 943389-05-4.

This dish is very savoury with a crunchy/chewy texture. The version I
had in the restaurant still had bones but was so well fried that I
just munched up the bones and all.

Incidentally, I'm going to buy the "Keo's" book as well. It looks
quite good too but seems to be tailored more toward Western kitchens.
For instance, it calls for brown sugar rather than palm sugar in most
recipes. Now that's a perfectly adequate substitution, but why bother
when I have palm sugar on hand? (Smug grin.)

Planked Fish

fish, seafood

1 x no ingredients

You will need some wood shingles.  You can get them at any hardware
store. Make sure they are cedar or pecan or some other hardwood. Not
pine or something that will give the fish a turpentine taste. Get one
for every serving planned.  And extra for later. Soak the shingles in
water for a couple of hours. I recommend using fish fillets for this
recipe as they will cook more evenly. Prepare the fish fillets, using
whatever spices you like, salt and pepper.

Remove the shingles from the water and pat dry.  Oil one side lightly
in the center where the fish will go. Place one piece of fish in the
center of each shingle. Then you will place the whole shingle, fish
and all on a hot grill or over a charcoal fire close enough to the
heat that the plank will smoke.  It is best to have a heat source
with a cover. Leave the plank on the heat source long enough for the
fish to cook, until it flakes easily. The plank will start to char on
the bottom and edges, this is what smokes the fish while it cooks,
this is ok. Serve the fish on the plank. This recipe is great for the
outdoors where a homemade camp "oven" can be used, no plates
necessary and totally biodegradable. Walt MM

Poached Orange Roughy With Hot Tomato Orange

fish, low cal, low fat

1 1/2 lb fresh tomatoes (about 3 med)
3 tablespoon white onion; grated
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup orange marmalade
2 tablespoon brandy
2 teaspoon whole coriander; crushed
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch cayenne
1 1/4 lb orange roughy fillets
1  lemon wedges (1 per serving)

Cut the unpeeled tomatoes in half crosswise, squeeze out the seed
pockets, and cut out the stem ends.  Dice the tomatoes and place in a
saucepan with the onion and salt. Cook over medium heat, 5 minutes,
stirring occasionally.  Add the marmalade and brandy and continue to
cook, 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  Add the coriander, cinnamon,
and cayenne and cook 5 minutes longer, stirring frequently.

Meanwhile, rinse the fish.  Place it in a skillet large enough to
hold it in a single layer and add enough water to just cover the
fish. Remove the fish and set aside. Bring the water to a boil over
high heat, reduce heat to medium, and add the fish in a single layer.
Bring back to a simmer, cover, and poach 3 to 5 minutes, depending on
the thickness of the fish. Fish is done when mostly opaque but still
barely translucent at the very center.  Remove from the poaching
liquid, draining off as much water as possible.  Place on a platter
and drain again.  Pour the hot tomato orange marmalade over the fish,
garnish with lemon wedges, and serve immediately.

Poached Salmon With Asparagus & Kohlrabi Sl

fish, main dish

2  whole leeks -- white, lt.
1  green onl
1 cup dry white wine
3 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon black peppercorns
1 bunch fresh oregano
4  whole salmon fillets --
1  skinless
20  whole asparagus spears
6  sprigs fresh dill -- for
1  garnish
1  kohlrabi slaw (see recipe)

Trim roots from leeks, leaving bases intact so leeks do not seperate
into layers when cut. Halve leeks lengthwise; wash thoroughly under
running water. Place 2 1/2 quarts water, wine, lemon juice, salt,
peppercorns, oregano and leeks in a large shallow saucepan. Bring to
a boil. Reduce heat to medium low; simmer until very flavorful, about
45 minutes. Meanwhile, slice into one long side of each salmon fillet
about 3/4 of the way through, forming a pocket. Trim tough bottoms
from asparagus; cut each spear in half. Arrange ten asparagus halves
in the pocket of each salmon fillet (parallel to the cut side) in two
rows of five, facing tips toward center. Press gently to close. Tie
kitchen string around salmon in two places, so pocket stays closed
while poaching. Return stock to a boil. Reduce heat so stock is at a
bare simmer. Add salmon and poach, adjusting heat to maintain a bare
simmer, for 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer salmon from stockpot to a glass
or ceramic baking dish. Allow liquid to cool for 5 minutes, then pour
over salmon; let stand until cool, about 1 hour. Remove salmon from
liquid; let stand to come toroom temperature, about 45 minutes. Untie
salmon and slice each fillet widthwise into 1-inch pieces; garnish
with dill sprigs and serve Kohlrabi Slaw on the side.

baking dish, thick sides to edge.  Cover tightly and microwave at
high 2 min. Turn baking dish 1/2 turn and microwave 2-3 min more
until small ends of steaks flake easily.  Let stand covered 3 min,
then serve with sauce.

Poached Salmon With Hollandaise Sauce

fish, main dish, sauces

3 cup water
1 teaspoon salt
4  black peppercorns
3  lemon slices
3  parsley sprigs
1  onion; sm, sliced
1  bay leaf
2 lb salmon steaks; *
1  *hollandaise sauce*
3  egg yolks; lg
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 cup butter; firm, **

Servings:  4

*      Get four salmon steaks about 1 inch thick. ** DO NOT use
margarine in this sauce!!

Prepare the Hollandaise Sauce.  Heat the water, salt, peppercorns,
lemon slices, parsley, onion, and bay leaf to boiling, in a 12-inch
skillet then reduce the heat. Cover and simmer 5 minutes. Place the
salmon steaks in the skillet, adding water if necessary to cover the
steaks. Heat to boiling and then reduce the heat. Simmer uncovered 12
to 15 minutes or until the fish flakes easily with a fork.  Serve
with the Hollandaise Sauce.

HOLLANDAISE SAUCE:

Stir the egg yolks and lemon juice vigorously in a 1 1/2-quart
saucepan. Add 1/4 cup of the butter and stir over very low heat,
stirring constantly, until the butter is melted. Add the remaining
butter. Continue stirring vigorously until the butter is melted and
the sauce is thickened. (Be sure the butter melts slowly as this
gives the eggs time to cook and thicken the sauce without curdling.)
Serve hot or at room temperature. Cover and refrigerate any remaining
sauce. To serve again, stir in a small amount of hot water.

Poached Salmon With Lobster Butter

seafood

1  whole 7-8 lb. salmon
1  salt
      ----FOR THE BUTTER----
1/2  lemon (juice only)
1  green-black lobster brain or
4 tablespoon reduced lobster stock *
6 oz butter

*Note: Lobster stock should be made from shells and heads, then
heavily reduced to make 3-4 tablespoons.

Scale, gut and wipe the fish.  Rub the inside cavity with salt. If
you have a fish kettle, steam the salmon whole over boiling water for
30-35 minutes (making sure the water is kept topped up).  Or wrap the
fish in lightly oiled foil and bake it in the oven for an hour at 325
F (170 C) gas mark 3. Leave it to rest while you make the butter.

Warm the lemon juice in a small basin over a saucepan of simmering
water. Beat in the nuggets of cold butter, adding more as each one
melts. Do this gently ~ it can split if you overheat it (revive it
with a quick splash of cold water).  When you have an unctuous smooth
sauce like thin cream, sieve and whisk in the green goo from the head
of the lobster - which immediately turns the butter a wonderful
orange-pink.

Serve the salmon when it is just cool but still sweet-flavoured and
full of its own juices, with piping hot baked potatoes and warm
lobster butter.

Poisson Cru

seafood, tahiti

2 lb halibut; skinned - boneless - 1 1/
2 lb tuna steaks; fresh - cut
1  1-1/2 thick
1 cup lime juice; fresh
1/2 cup onions; coarsely chopped
2 teaspoon salt
3 each tomatoes *
1/2 cup scallions; coarsely chopped include
1/4 cup green bell peppers; chopped
2 each eggs; hard-cooked chopped
1 cup cocoanut top milk; rich chilled

* Tomatoes should be medium-sized, firm, ripe, stemmed, peeled and
coarsely chopped. Chill the halibut or fresh tuna steaks briefly in
the freezer in order to firm the meat and make it easier to cut, but
do not let the fish freeze completely. With a cleaver or large, sharp
knife, cut the steaks lengthwise into 1/4-inch slices, then cut each
slice into pieces 1 1/2 inch square.
In a deep bowl, mix the lime juice, onions and salt together.
Drop in the fish and turn it about with a spoon until the strips are
evenly coated. Cover and marinate at room temperature for at least 2
hours, or in the refrigerator for 3 or 4 hours, stirring the fish
occasionally.
When done, the fish will be opaque and fairly firm, indicating
the it is fully "cooked". Taste to make sure; if it seems underdone,
marinate the fish for an hour or so longer.
To serve, drain the fish and squeeze it slightly to remove all the
excess moisture. Place the fish is a serving bowl, add the tomatoes,
scallions, green peppers and hard cooked eggs and cocoanut milk and
toss them all together gently but thoroughly. Note: The term poisson
cru means raw fish. The recipe itself is similar to the civiche
popular in many Latin American countries which "cooks" fish in a
marinade of lime or lemon juice seasoned with onions, garlic and hot
chilies. Source: Time-Life Books Foods of the World, Pacific and

Pork & Scallops With Crisp Ginger

meats, pork, seafood

1 lb asparagus
1 large red pepper
2  2-3 pieces ginger
1  pork tenderloin; (about 3/4 lb)
2 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
2 tablespoon dry sherry
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 cup canola oil
1/2 lb brown mushrooms
1/4 teaspoon salt; optional
3/4 lb bay scallops

To remove tough ends from tender asparagus spears--the easy way, hold
base of stalk firmly and bend.  End will snap and break off at just
the right spot for the best eating.

About 1 hour before serving, discard tough ends from asparagus, trim
scales, cut diagonally into 3-inch pieces. Cut pepper into strips.
Peel ginger; grate 1 teaspoon. Cut remaining ginger lengthwise into
very thin slices; cut slices into hair-thin strips.  Cut pork
tenderloin into 1/8-inch-thick slices.  In bowl, mix pork, soy sauce,
sherry, cornstarch, sugar, and grated ginger.

In 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat, in hot oil, cook ginger
strips about 1 minute or so until it has a light browned color.
Remove ginger with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. In oil
remaining in skillet, cook asparagus, red pepper, mushrooms, and salt
(optional) until vegetables are tender-crisp, stirring quickly and
frequently. With slotted spoon, remove vegetables to plate.

In oil remaining in skillet over high heat, cook pork mixture over
high heat a minute or so.  Add scallops and cook until pork loses its
pink color and scallops are tender about 2 to 3 minutes, adding a
little more oil if it is needed.  Return vegetables to skillet;
stir-fry until heated through. Spoon pork mixture onto platter;
sprinkle with ginger strips. Makes 6 servings.

Note: Meat slices more easily if it is frozen slightly (about 40
minutes). You can hold your knife on a slant and slice across the
width to get nicely uniform pieces.

Portugal: Fish Stew (Caldeirada De Peixe)

seafood, soup/stew

1/2 lb fish; whatever available or  sh
2 pinch salt
4 tablespoon olive oil
2  onions; chopped
8  tomatoes; peeled & chopped
1  green pepper; seeded &  chopped
4 large cloves garlic; crushed
1 pinch nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
3 teaspoon piri-piri sauce  see recipe
1 small glass dry white wine
1  handful coriander leaves; chopped
4  slices of bread with the  crusts cu; t off

This is a real fisherman's stew, dependent on whatever the boats have
brought in.  The spices and hervs give the dish its special Portuguese
identity.

Clean the fish and cut into fairly small pieces, removing as many
bones as possible.  Sprinkle the salt over the fish and leave while
you make the following sauce. Heat 2-3 Tbsp of the oil in a saucepan
and stir in the onions, tomatoes and pepper. Cook gently until they
start to soften, then put in the garlic, nutmeg, allspice and
piri-piri sauce. Add the wine and a little water. Cook for about 5
minutes, stirring frequently, then remove from the heat. Lightly oil
the bottom of a shallow, ovenproff dish (preferably earthenware). Put
in a layer of fish followed by a layer of sauce and sprinkle with
coriander. Continue with these layers until the ingredients are used
up. Cover the top of with the bread and sprikle well with the
remaining oil or dot with a little butter. Cook in a pre-heated oven
at 350 degrees F. for about 30 minutes or until the fish is tender.
Serve with boiled or sliced and fried potatoes, bread and a slad to
make a substantial main meal. If you cannot obtain coriander leaves,
you can use fresh parsley instead, but this will alter the flavour of
the dish.

Posole (Mexican Pork & Chile Stew)

ethnic, meats, seafood, soup/stew

2 lb pork roast,cut in chunks
2 each pork shanks or pigs feet
2 cup posole
2 each cloves garlic, mashed
4 each red chili pods,remove seeds
1/2 lb pork rinds (skins)
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon oregano
2 tablespoon chopped onion

Place meat and pork rinds and pork shanks in a large kettle and add
about 5 quarts of water or enough to cover meat. Add approximately 1
tablespoon salt and bring to a boil. Cook over medium heat for about
1 1/2 hours. Remove excess grease and set aside. Reserve liquid. Wash
the posole very carefully until the water is clear so as to remove
lime from kernels. Put in large kettle and cover with water. Boil
until posole has popped. Mix meat, posole, rind and shanks or pigs
feet. Add oregano, garlic, onion and chili pods. Let simmer for about
1/2 hour. Posole may be served as a main dish with hard rolls,
tortillas or crackers. Additional red chili sauce may be added at
serving time for more spice. NOTE:Posole can be found in the meat
section if it is available in your area, if not available, hominy can
be substituted in the same quantities but no rinsing or pre-cooking
is needed. The posole will lose its authenticity but none of its
tastiness if pork rinds, pork shanks or pigs feet are omitted. You
can also add one can of tomatoes to enhance the flavor.

Potted Shrimp

seafood, shrimp

1 lb fairly small shrimp, shells
1  on
1 cup butter
2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1  pinch of nutmeg
1  pinch ground mace
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1  salt & pepper

1) Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Toss the shrimp and, 1
minute later, start tasting them; they'll cook very quickly. Drain
them immediatly and peel when they are cool. Cut them into little
bite-size pieces.

2) Melt 1/2 c of the butter over medium heat; stir in the shrimp,
lemon juice, nutmeg, mace, cayenne, salt and pepper, and turn off the
heat. Divide the shrimp among small bowls or place in a nice crock.

3) Melt the remaining butter over very low heat. Skim the foam off
the top, then carefully pour the clarified butter over the shrimp,
leaving the butter solids in the pan. Refrigerate immediately.

4) Served chilled or slightly warmed as a spread ( Traditionaly
served on brown bread. ) Alternatives for this:

Prawn & Mango Curry

indian, seafood

1  text only

This simple Indian curry is a good example of green mango use. To 50 g
desiccated coconut add just enough boiling water to moisten, stir and
set aside (or use 70 g fresh coconut). Peel 800 g green prawns and
devein them. Peel two green mangoes and cut the flesh into 2 cm cubes.

Into the bowl of a food processor put 3 birdseye chillies (or less to
taste), a tablespoon of ground coriander and the coconut. Process to a
paste.

Peel and slice 2 onions.  Chop half a bunch of fresh coriander. In a

Prawn Vindaloo (Hot Prawns)

ethnic, indian, seafood

1 tablespoon garlic; sliced
1 tablespoon hot red chili peppers, fresh sliced
2 teaspoon cumin seed; ground
1 teaspoon mustard seeds
1 teaspoon black peppercorns
1 teaspoon tumeric; ground
1/4 cup cider vinegar
1/4 cup corn oil
1 cup onion slices; ground to paste
2 lb prawns; or large shrimp peeled &

Grind the garlic, chili, cumin seed, mustard seeds, peppercorns &
tumeric together in a processor with 2 Tbsp of vinegar to act as a
lubricant.
Heat the oil in a pan and fry the onion paste over moderately low
heat until light brown. Add the ground spices and continue to fry the
mixture until it turns reddish, with a 'crumbled' look.
Add the prawns & cook, stirring frequently for 10 minutes. Add the
balance of the vinegar, the water and salt and continue to simmer,
uncovered, for 5 minutes more. There will be very little sauce. Serve
warm

VARIATION: The prawn vindaloo can be prepared as a proper pickle,
which means that it is a bottled (or refrigerated condiment) used now
and then with other foods as an adjunct to the meat or fish dishes
being served. Should you wish to prepare this as a pickle, follow the
instructions, but omit the onions & and the water & cook the prawns
separately in 2 Tbsp of oil before adding them to the mixture.

Prawns In Spice Laden Coconut Sauce

indian, seafood

14 oz canned coconut milk
8  dried, red chile peppers *
2 teaspoon cumin seeds
2 teaspoon coriander seeds
1 teaspoon turmeric
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
6  garlic cloves, minced
5 tablespoon peanut oil
1 large onion, thinly sliced
1  salt
1 lb prawns, shelled, deveined

* seeded or partially seeded (reduce or increase amount for a milder
or spicier flavor)

Do yourself a favor and use canned coconut milk in this recipe. It's
a heck of a lot easier and probably better than what you would
produce using a fresh coconut.

Process the grated fresh coconut or the desiccated coconut with 3 1/2
cups hot water in a food processor. Drape a piece of folded
cheesecloth over a bowl and pour the coconut mixture into the
cheesecloth. Strain the liquid, squeezing the pulp to extract as much
milk as possible. This is thick coconut milk; set aside.

Pour 2 1/2 cups hot water over the coconut in the cheesecloth and
squeeze to extract more milk into another bowl. This second extract
is thin coconut milk.  Set aside.

If you are using canned coconut milk, skip this step and proceed with
the recipe.

Grind the chile peppers, cumin and coriander seeds in a spice grinder
and set aside.

Process the thick coconut milk (or canned coconut milk) with the
ground spices, turmeric, ginger and garlic; set aside.

Heat the oil in a heavy, shallow pan.  Add the onions and cook until
the edges begin to turn almost reddish brown (about 15 minutes),
stirring frequently.  Add the coconut-spice mixture and cook until
the liquid evaporates and oil separates from the paste.  Cook this
paste for 10 more minutes, stirring constantly.

Stir in the reserved thin coconut milk (or 2 cups water, if you have
used canned coconut milk) and let simmer until reduced to a creamy
sauce. Add salt to taste.

Stir the prawns into the sauce and cook a few minutes until the
prawns are just cooked.  (Be careful not to overcook). Serve with
steamed rice.

Grated fresh coconut:  Pierce the eyes of a fresh coconut and drain
off the liquid.  Put the coconut in a preheated 375F oven for 20
minutes. Break it open with a hammer and separate the meat from the
hard shell in large pieces.  Break the pieces into smaller ones and,
using a vegetable peeler, peel the brown skin off the meat. Grate the
coconut meat in a food processor.

Desiccated coconut:  May be found in Indian or Chinese stores.

Prawns With Chimichurri Sauce

bbq, sauces, seafood

2  to 10 cloves garlic, peeled
1  and coarsely chopped
1  red jalapeno pepper, stemmed
1  seeded and coarsely chopped
1/4 cup fresh oregano leaves
1 cup fresh parsley leaves
1/4 cup red-wine or sherry vinegar
1/2 cup olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 lb jumbo prawns

1. Prepare the garlic.  Traditionally this is a garlicky sauce, but
the amount of garlic used would be according to personal taste. 2.
Combine the garlic and jalapeno in a food processor and mince finely.
Add the oregano and parsley and pulse to a fine chop.  Add the
vinegar, olive oil and salt, processing until smooth and emulsified.
(The sauce can be used immediately; or pour into a jar, cover and
refrigerate until ready to use.) 3. Remove about 1/3 cup of the sauce
to use as a baste for the prawns. Prepare a charcoal or gas grill.
Place prawns on a well-oiled grill, 4 to 6 inches from the source of
heat. Baste and cook about 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until prawns
are pink and cooked through. 4. Serve with the remaining sauce on the
side. Note: The sauce can also be used with beef, chicken or pork.

In the bowl of a food processor, combine butter, cilantro, ginger and
garlic. Process until smooth. Add the juice of 3 limes and mix well.

Saute bell peppers and prawns in the cilantro-butter mixture over
medium heat. The wine may be added at this point. (It helps keep the
butter from scorching and makes a smoother sauce.) Cook until prawns
are pink and just barely done. Season with salt and pepper.

Serve on 1/2 cup of julienned spinach for each serving, drizzling the
butter over the top to wilt the spinach. Garnish with lime wedges.

Pusit Relleno

mexican, seafood

      ----STUFFED CALAMARI----
12 large squids
1/2 lb ground pork
3  green onions, finely sliced
1  egg, beaten
1  salt and pepper to taste
1  garlic clove, minced
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 medium tomato, chopped
1/2  bay leaf
1 tablespoon soy sauce

Remove squid heads and ink sacs, clean the calamari outside and
inside. Sprinkle salt lightly on squids and set aside. In a large
bowl combine ground pork, green onions, beaten egg and a little salt
and pepper. Stuff squid cavities with meat mixture. This is messy and
slippery, don't over stuff the calamari as the stuffing will swell
when cooking. A pastry bag makes this easier to do. Place a pan in a
steamer and steam the calamari covered for 10-15 minutes, or until
filling is cooked. Drain liquid and set aside. Prepare sauce while
steaming calamari. In a skillet over medium heat, saute garlic in oil
until lightly browned. Add onion and stir for 1 minute. Add tomato,
bay leaf and soy sauce and cook for 3-5 minutes until tomato pieces
are soft. Pour sauce on top of stuffed calamari. Serve with rice.
Note: I save the tentacles from the calamari and as a side dish stir
fry them with some shrimp and vegetables. I used the broth from
steaming the calamari as a liquid in this dish. This is NOT a good
dish to serve to people who don't like calamari or are a bit
squeamish. Regular bananas can be used but they should be very firm
and green.

Pyi-Gyi Nga Kazun Ywet (Squid & Dandelion S

burma, seafood

1 teaspoon dried red hot chili flakes
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon brown sugar
2 teaspoon corn or peanut oil
1  clove garlic, chopped fine
1 lb fresh squids, dressed, cut into 1/2; -inch round slices
1/4 lb dandelion greens, green leaves only; , halved

Watercress and Swiss chard are good substitutes for dandelion since
they all have a slightly bitter but appealing taste.

1.  Mix the chili flakes, lemon juice, soy sauce, and sugar together.
Let stand for 15 minutes.

2.  Heat the oil in a wok or skillet and over moderate heat fry the
garlic for 1 minute.  Add the squid slices and stir fry for 2
minutes. Add the chili/lemon mixture and continue to fry.

3.  Add the dandelion greens and cook for 2 minutes more. Do not
overcook since it toughens the squid.

Serve warm with other dishes.

Red Chile Pesto Clams

fish, main dish, seafood

60  clams
12  ancho chilies; dried
12  new mexico red chiles; dried
1/2 cup pine nuts
10  cloves garlic; lg, *
2 tablespoon oregano; fresh, or
2 teaspoon oregano; mexican, roasted
1  zest of 2 lemons
1/2 cup olive oil; extra virgin
1  juice of 2 limes
5 cup fish stock; or clam juice
12  sprigs coriander

Servings:  4

*    The large garlic cloves should be roasted and peeled.

Scrub the clams and discard any open ones.  Clams that have a strong
odor or are heavy (indicating that they contain sand) are likely to
be dead and should also be discarded. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees
F. Roast the dried chiles in a large skillet, over medium-high heat,
for 4 to 5 minutes, turning frequently to avoid burning. Remove the
stems and seeds and place the chiles in a large bowl. Pour boiling
water over them, cover, and let sit until they are very soft, about
40 minutes. Roast the pine nuts in the oven for about 8 minutes or
until golden, stirring occasionally. Place the chiles, roasted
garlic, lemon zest, 1/4 cup of olive oil, and oregano in a food
processor or blender and puree until smooth. Add the remaining 1/4
cup of olive oil and blend thoroughly. Add the pine nuts and process
until coarsely chopped.  Season to taste with lime juice. Place the
clams in a large pan, over medium-high heat, with the fish stock or
clam juice. When the clams open, remove them from the cooking liquid.
Reduce the liquid by half, then whisk in the chile pesto. To serve,
divide clams, evenly between four soup bowls, pour the pesto mixture
over them, and garnish with coriander leaves. Serve immediately.

Red Chile Risotto Clams

fish, main dish, seafood

4 lb small clams; about 5 dozen
6 each cloves garlic; lg. sliced
6 each stems parsley; fresh
8 cup water
1 cup white wine
7 cup clam juice; or fish stock
1/2 cup white onion; finely diced
7 tablespoon butter or regular margarine
2 1/2 cup arborio rice
4 teaspoon garlic; very finely minced
4 tablespoon roma tomatoes; chopped
4 tablespoon hot new mexico chile powder*
4 tablespoon red bell pepper; diced
4 tablespoon yellow bell pepper; diced
6 tablespoon fresh imported parmesan; **
2 teaspoon fresh parsley; finely chopped

*    Or you can use Medium Molido and cayenne mixed. ** The Parmesan
cheese should be finely ground or grated.

Scrub the clams and discard any dead ones, (See Recipe 16). In a wide
bottomed stainless steel or enamel pan, place the sliced garlic,
parsley, 4 cups of water, wine, and the clams in a single layer.
Cover and bring to a boil, simmer over low heat until the clams open
up, no more than 4 to 5 minutes.  Turn the heat off and let sit for a
further 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the clams from the broth and extract
the meat from the shells. Open any clam shells that remain closed
with a knife over a separate bowl, in case any are bad. Allow the
broth to cool, remove the garlic and parsley, and strain, if
necessary to remove sand or other foreign particles. Combine the
broth with enough clam juice to equal 11 cups of liquid. Saute the
onion with 3 tb of butter, over medium heat in a large pan, until
soft, about 15 minutes.  Add the rice and cook for 5 minutes, over
medium heat, stirring constantly (Cooking any longer will make the
rice tough). Add 2 cups each of water and clam juice, alternating 1
cup of water, 1 cup of juice, stirring continuously. This should be
absorbed after about 10 minutes or so, then add, alternately in 1/2
cup increments, 2 cups of water and 1 cup of clam juice, stir and
allow to absorb for another 5 to 10 minutes. At this stage the rice
should be about 1/2 cooked. (If preparing this dish ahead of time,
stop at this point and lay out the rice on a long flat sheet pan to
prevent it gumming together.) Add the minced garlic, tomatoes, and
chile powder and continue stirring and cooking over medium heat for
10 minutes.  Then add a further 4 cups of clam juice, 1/2 cup at a
time.  Add the peppers and add another 3 cups of clam juice, in 1/4
cup increments and allow to absorb for 8 to 10 minutes. Add the clams
and the remaining 1 cup of clam juice in 1/4 cup increments and allow
the liquid to absorb for 2 to 3 minutes.  Remove the pan from the
heat, stir in the remaining butter and cheese and garnish with
parsley sprinkled on top. Serve hot.

Red Pepper Swordfish

fish

6  swordfish steaks (each about 1/2 lb; and about 1 inch thick)
1 large sweet red pepper
2  lemons
3 tablespoon oregano, fresh
1 cup olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper, fresh ground
1  white wine, dry

Remove seeds and ribs from pepper and cut into 1/4 inch cubes. Put in
a bowl and mix well with the juice of the two lemons, the olive oil,
salt, pepper and the oregano.

Heat broiler and pour wine to a depth of about 1/8 inch in a broiler
pan. Lay swordfish steaks in wine and broil for 3 minutes. Pour the
seasoned lemon, oil and oregano mixture over the fish and cook for 3
to 4 minutes more (until fish is cooked through and lightly browned.)
Immediately transfer fish to a warmed serving dish.

You may need to reduce the sauce slightly by boiling vigorously and
stirring for 2 minutes more. Pour sauce over fish and serve.

NOTES:

*  Swordfish steaks cooked with sweet red peppers -- This recipe was
handed out to people buying swordfish at my local fishmonger; I tried
it and it was delicious. It is also very quick and simple to make.

*  I served fresh asparagus with this, but any light vegetable would
be fine. Boiled new potatoes would be nice, too.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes.
: Precision:  no need to measure.

Red Snapper A La Mexicaine

fish

6  fresh red snapper filets
1  salt
1  freshly ground white pepper
1  flour for dredging
4 tablespoon olive oil
3 large shallots, finely minced
3 large garlic cloves, finely chopped
6  ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded & cho; pped
2 tablespoon finely chopped fresh herbs (oregano; , thyme & chervil)
1  ripe avocado
1 teaspoon lime juice
1 dash tabasco
      ----OPTIONAL----
1  beurre manie*
1 tablespoon tomato paste
      ----GARNISH----
1  avocado slices
1  lime slices
1  fresh mint leaves

* Beurre Manie is used to thicken sauces.  Combine 1 T flour and 1 T
sweet butter on a small flat plate and blend the mixture with a fork
into a very smooth paste. Roll the paste into a ball. Preheat oven to
350 degrees. Season the fish filets with salt and pepper and dredge
them lightly with flour, shaking off the excess. Heat the olive oil
in a large skillet and saute the filets over high heat for 2 or 3
minutes on each side. Remove them carefully to a flameproof baking
dish large enough to hold the fish in one layer. In the same oil,
saute the shallots and 2 cloves of garlic. When the shallots are
lightly browned, add the tomatoes and cook the mixture for 2 minutes.
Pour the mixture together with the herbs on top of the fish and cover
the disk with buttered wax paper. Bake in the oven for 25 to 30
minutes. While the fish is baking, mash the avocado in a small mixing
bowl, adding lime juice, salt, pepper, a little Tabasco, and the
remaining clove of garlic. Do not mash it too fine; it should have
some small chunks left in it. When the fish is ready, lift it out
carefully onto a platter. Place the baking dish over direct heat and
reduce the juices by 1/3. If a Beurre Manie is used for thickening,
add it bit by bit before adding the avocado puree. Add the optional
tomato paste. Lower the heat and beat in the mashed avocado. Once the
avocado puree has been added, do not let the mixture come to a boil.
Correct the seasoning and pour the sauce over the fish. Garnish with
avocado slices, lime slices and mint leaves.

In a heavy saucepan, combine water, butter, salt and bay leaf.

Pour in cornmeal in a thin stream, stirring constantly.  Bring

turning once, until lightly golden but not cooked through, about 5
minutes.

Drain on paper towels and set aside.

In separate large skillet, heat olive oil over medium high heat.
Add onion and scallion and saute, tossing until lightly golden, about
5    minutes.

Add fish in single layer and sprinkle with salt.

Spoon tomato paste between pieces of fish and cook about 3
minutes, shaking pan occasionally.

Stir together vinegar and hot water and add to fish.  Bring to
boil then lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, 2 to 3 minutes.

Carefully turn pieces of fish.

Increase heat to medium high and continue to cook just until
fish is cooked through, about 10 minutes.

plates.

Boil sauce vigorously until slightly thickened and correct
seasoning with salt, pepper, and a few drops of wine vinegar, if
needed.

Pour over fish and serve immediately.

Yucatan peninsula dishes. The most famous is cochinita pibil; a
suckling pig, marinated with this spice paste and wrapped in banana
leaves, baked in a Mayan earth oven called a pib. Large fish and
venison or other wild game are also baked in pibs. I slather this
paste on guinea hens and broil them on the rotisserie, or wrap
marinated chicken breasts or fish fillets in banana leaves with
slices of orange and steam the packets. One of my favorite appetizers
is chicken drummettes baked with this recado.

perfect entree for a warm-weather luncheon.  Stuff the cavity with a
few sprigs of parsley or tarragon and watch out for bones when
eating. (WP)

1. Score the fillets with a sharp knife (they will absorb the marinade
better), arrange on a plate, and spoon over the olive oil. Sprinkle
with the basil and red onion, and let marinate for 1 hour,
refrigerated. Just before cooking, season lightly with salt and
pepper.

2. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

3. Prepare the vegetable vinaigrette: In a small bowl, whisk together
the 1/3 cup olive oil, vinegar, and lime juice. Set aside.

4. With a vegetable peeler, peel away any rough scales on the
asparagus spears, cut off the hard bottoms, and dice. Blanch the
asparagus, carrot, broccoli, and red pepper separately. (You can do
this most easily by placing each vegetable in a fine strainer and
plunging into boiling salted water for about 2 minutes per
vegetable.) Cool and transfer to a mixing bowl.  Add the tomatoes,
shallots, and sun dried tomatoes. Whisk the dressing and, reserving a
little for the greens, toss the vegetables with the dressing and
season with salt and pepper to taste.

5. Heat an ovenproof skillet large enough to hold the fillets in one
layer. Add the 2 teaspoons of olive oil and when it almost begins to
smoke, lay the fillets in the pan and sear on one side for 1 minute.
Transfer to the oven and continue to cook 3 to 4 minutes longer. The
fillets do not need to be flipped.  (Fish should be cooked on the
outside and a little underdone on the inside.)

6. Toss the greens with the reserved dressing.

Presentation: Divide the greens and mound in the center of 4 large
serving plates.  Arrange a layer of the vegetable vinaigrette on one
side of the greens and top with one of the fillets, skin-side down.
Serve immediately.

To prepare ahead: Have the fish marinating, the salad greens cleaned
and ready, the vegatables blanced, and continue with the recipe at
serving time.

*To reconstitute sun-dried tomatoes, steep in boiling water to cover
until tender, 3 to 5 minutes.

Red Snapper~ Veracruz (Huachinango Ala Veracr

fish

1  red snapper 4 lb.
2 tablespoon salt or to taste
3 tablespoon lime juice
3 lb tomatoes peeled,seeded and chopped; (save seed + peel)
4 tablespoon olive oil
1 large white onion sliced thinly
15  pitted green olives
3 tablespoon large capers, drained
6  whole chile largos-canned or jalepe; nos en escabeche canned
1 1/2 tablespoon italian, flat leaf parsley
1  sweet red pepper-canned or
1  fresh peeled and cut into
1  strips

METHOD: Rinse the fish well in cold water to remove any remaining
scales. Pierce the flesh on both sides with a sharp fork and rub in
the lime juice and about 2 tsp of the salt. set the fish aside to
season in an ovenproof dish into which it will just fit. ( If dish is
too large the sauce will dry up.) Preheat oven to 350. Heat the oil
in a heavy frying pan. Add the onions and fry gently, stirring from
time to time, until they are wilted but not browned. Add the chopped
tomatoes. Press the seeds and pulp through a strainer to extract all
the juice and add it with the olives, capers, half of the parsley and
salt to taste. Cook over a fairly high flame until the sauce is
well-seasoned and reduced-- about ten minutes. Pour the sauce over
the fish. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove
foil, turn the fish over and continue baking, uncovered, basting with
the sauce from time to time for a further 25 minutes or until fish is
done. When tested with a fork the flesh should flake easily away from
the bone. Sprinkle with the rest of the parsley and decorate with the
strips of red pepper. Serve the fish with plenty of the sauce and hot
tortillas and/or white rice.

serve over rice. Source: Chef Michael Richard of Cafe Vermilionville,
Lafayette, LA. In Cajun land, this is pronounced Coo-bee-yon. NOTE-My
mother-in-law used to add a touch of Creole mustard to her sauce. It
gave it a good tangy flavor. Also she would put the filets in a
baking dish, pour the sauce over and bake in the oven, so the fish
would not fall apart. Contrary to what Chef Richard says, this dish is
customarily served with mashed potatoes in my neck of the woods.

Note:  This was the Grand Prize Winner in the first of The Oregonian-
James Beard recipe contests, held in 1975. The winner's name was
Reino Koski. This is a Finnish soup.

Use any cut salmon or steelhead, leaving skin on.  In 1 quart water,
with salt and pepper, simmer on low heat in 5- or 6-quart pot. When
skin comes off easily, set aside on plate and remove skin and bones.
Cut or break into 1- and 2-inch pieces.  In liquid stock, place bay
leaves and whole allspice.  Add potatoes, cut in 1- or 1 1/2-inch
pieces; carrots, cut lengthwise and into half circles about 1/4-inch
thick; and 2 onions cubed coarsely (not chopped fine).  Cook over low
heat. After a short while, add red cabbage and celery leaves. Stir.
Cook until carrots are almost tender and potatoes don't disintegrate.

While this is cooking, dice bacon and cook in fry pan over low heat.
Pour almost all fat off.  Add butter (or margarine) and diced celery,
remaining onion (diced fine) and green pepper. Saute' until onions
are yellow and peppers are pale green.  Now back to your pot. Add
salmon pieces, (they should be not quite cooked). From now on
everything is simmered on low to preserve body.  Add clams with
broth, shrimp and 1 quart water. Put in stuff from fry pan.  Add
pimento, mushrooms, rosemary, cumin, thyme, oregano and chilies. Stir
in milk a cup at a time. Add butter and let whole bit simmer for at
least one hour.  Serve with tossed salad and garlic bread.  Can be
frozen.

River and in the small village of Runate, Italy. This is one of the
house specialties, risotto made with wild onions and catfish.)MR

Antonio Santini is adamant about using Vialone Nano rice for this
dish, but arborito will work almost as well. If you can find those
little onions that look like scallions but have very rounded bulbs
(cipollotti), use those for a more assertive onion flavor and cut the
final amount of chives in half.
In pot bring 4 cups water to boil with lemon, celery, carrot and
fennel. Reduce to simmer and add catfish. Cook at bare simmer until
just flaking, about 6 to 10 minutes. Remove fish from poaching
liquid. Reserve poaching liquid, adding enough fish stock or water to
make 5 cups. Keep at boil for cooking risotto.
While fish is poaching, melt 2 tb butter over med. heat in skillet.
Add onion and cook slowly, stirring, until onion is very tender. When
onion is tender, add fish and cook several minutes more. Season to
taste with salt and pepper. Let cool. When fish is cool, chop coarsly.
In separate saute pan, cook wild onion in 1 tb butter over med.
heat with dash salt and 2 tb water. When water evaporates, add rice
and cook cook several minutes, until rice makes a dry "singing" sound
when stirred. Add 1 cup boiling stock and cook, stirring until almost
all stock is absorbed by rice. Repeat, 1 cup at time, until rice is
creamy and still bit chalky to bite, about 15 minutes. Add fish, wine
and chives and cook another 2 to 3 minutes. When rice is cooked al
dente, add remaining butter and stir vigorously so mixture becomes
creamier. Rice should have a slightly soupy consistancy. Makes 4
servings.

Risted Laks Med Kremsaus (Fried Trout In Sour

main dish, norwegian, seafood

4  trout; fresh or frozen, about 1/
1  salt
1/2 cup flour
4 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 cup sour cream
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon parsley; fresh chopped

If you are using frozen trout, defrost them completely before
cooking. Wash fish under cold running water, pat dry inside and out
and sprinkle a little salt into the cavities. Spread the 1/2 cup
flour over wax paper, roll the fish around in the flour and shake off
any excess. In a heavy 10-12" skillet, heat 2 tb butter and 2 tb oil.
When foam subsides, lower heat to moderate and fry the trout, 2 at a
time, for about 5 minutes on each side, turning them carefully with a
large spatula. When all the trout have been browned, keep them warm
on a heatproof platter in a 200øF. oven while you quickly make the
sauce. Pour off all the fat from the skillet and replace it with 2
tablespoons fresh butter. Stir over low heat, scraping up the brown
pan drippings with a wooden spoon. Add the sour cream and continue
stirring for about 3 minutes without letting the cream boil. Stir in
the lemon juice and pour the sauce over the hot fish. Garnish with
chopped parsley and serve at once.

Riverside Kedgeree

seafood

1/2 lb cold cooked salmon or trout*
1 large cucumber
1 bunch watercress
1/4 lb shelled young peas
8 oz brown rice
2 oz butter
1  a little caster sugar
1  a little tarragon vinegar

*Note: Salmon, sea trout or river trout may be used (farmed trout is
unsuitable - its texture is too soft).

Peel and seed the cucumber and cut the flesh into pieces no larger
than matchsticks.  Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and caster
sugar and 1 teaspoon tarragon vinegar. Toss lightly and set aside for
at least 40 minutes, or all day if you prefer, to draw out some of
the cucumber juices. Drain well and pat dry.

Cook the rice in double its volume of boiling salted water or, better
still, in fish stock.  It will take about 35 minutes to become tender.
Towards the end of this time cook the vegetables. Boil the peas in a
little lightly sugared water.  Melt the butter in a flameproof
casserole, add the sticks of cucumber and cook over medium-low heat
for 2 minutes, just stirring occasionally. Break the skinned and
boned fish into big flaky chunks.  Lay the fish on top of the
cucumber ~ don't stir it in. Cover the casserole and reduce heat as
low as possible. Leave to cook, just shaking the casserole
occasionally, until the cucumber is tender and the fish is well
heated through - 4 minutes or so. Meanwhile put the watercress into a
food-processor and reduce it to green flecks.

To assemble the kedgeree, add the prepared watercress, peas and
cooked rice to the buttery fish and cucumber mixture. Immediately
draw the casserole away from the heat and season it generously with
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Toss the ingredients
gently but thoroughly to mix them well and serve straight away with a
large fresh green salad, or with a tomato salad if you prefer. Serves
4-6.

Roast Ginger & Green Onion Crab In The Shel

seafood

1  stephen ceideburg
1  live dungeness crab, about 2 to 3 p; ounds
3 tablespoon peanut oil
1 teaspoon salt
1  eight 1/2-inch knobs peeled fresh g; inger, bruised
4  garlic cloves, bruised
8  green onions, cut into 2-inch lengt; hs
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
1/4 cup dry vermouth or sherry
1 tablespoon dark soy sauce, or to taste
1/4 cup chicken stock
1 teaspoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon; water
1 teaspoon asian sesame oil

Although this popular crab dish It's often called 'roasted' or
'baked', it is not. In restaurants, the cracked crab pieces are
briefly deep-fried, then quickly stir-fried and finished in a hot
wok. For the home cook, I have omitted the deep-frying step. Set up
finger bowls and containers for discarded shells. Serve with hot rice
and soup or salad.

Hold crab under cold running water and scrub with a vegetable brush,
paying special attention to the underside of the body and between the
legs.

To kill the crab, plunge it into a large stockpot of boiling water
for 1 minute, or place the crab upside down in a large bowl and cover
it with boiling water. When the air bubbles stop rising to the
surface, drain the crab and let cool until you can handle it.

If using cooked crab, omit this ,step and proceed to cleaning.

To clean cooked crab: Place crab on its back. With a knife tip lift
the apron or breastplate, the triangular-shaped flap on its
underside. Grab it and the spine; pull backward, twist and remove.
Grab the shell portion in one hand while gathering up all the legs
and claws in the other hand. Rock the legs back and forth, tearing
them away, from the shell. Pull off the feathery gills from both
sides of the chest, remove the mouth and mandibles from its face and
discard. Rinse crab with cold water. Blot dry. You may reserve the
tomalley, the green spongy matter in the body, for another use,
although state and federal authorities have advised against eating
the tomalley in this season's crab.

To crack crab: Bend and twist legs backward to remove. With a hammer
or nutcracker, crack the shell in the middle of each joint and claws,
and in the middle section on the edge side of each leg. Pat dry.
Using a cleaver or chef's knife, chop the body through the
midsection, dividing it into 2 halves, then each half crosswise into
thirds.

To "roast" crab: Preheat a wok over medium-high heat. Add oil, salt,
ginger and garlic and half the green onions; saute gently to release
the flavors. Using the backside of a spatula, crush the ingredients
against the side of the wok to squeeze out juices about 30 seconds,
or until fragrant.

Increase heat to high. Add crab claws and legs; stir-fry for 1
minute, or until shells turn bright orange, then toss in chest pieces
and cook together for another 2 minutes. Season with the sugar and
white pepper. While the wok is hot, splash the vermouth against
sides, then the soy sauce. There should be a sizzle and hiss. Toss
together for 10 seconds.

Add chicken stock; toss to mix. Scatter remaining green onions over
crab. Cover wok and "roast" or braise over high heat for 3 to 5
minutes, or until crab turns bright orange. (If using cooked crab,
braise for 1 minute, or until heated through). Shake wok occasionally
to redistribute crab.

Remove cover. Add cornstarch mixture in center of wok and stir until
thickened (about 10 seconds). When the sauce glazes the crab, fold in
sesame oil. Remove to a platter. If you prefer, discard ginger and
garlic. Serve immediately with steamed rice.

Roasted Marinated Crab

seafood

1  live crab, 2 to 2 1/2 pounds
3 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon shredded ginger
1 tablespoon chopped garlic
2  serrano or other small green chiles; , chopped
1  freshly ground black pepper
2  to 4 tablespoons butter
1  salt to taste

To kill the crab, either plunge it into a large pot of boiling water
for a minute, or place it on its back on a cutting board and split
the body down the middle with one quick cut with a heavy knife or
Chinese cleaver. If you want to use the upper shell in the
presentation, the first technique works better.

Holding the crab body by the legs, pull off the shell. Discard the
feathery gills on both sides of the body and the spongy mass in the
middle of the back; rinse until nothing but shell and meat show. Pull
out the bits of greenish fat from the corners of the shell; reserve
if desired for the sauce.  Rinse both the body and shell and drain
thoroughly.

Split the body of the crab (if it is not already split) into 2 halves
with legs and claws still attached. Carefully crack each leg and claw
segment with a mallet.

Place in a large bowl with the oil, ginger, garlic, chiles and a
generous grinding of pepper.  Marinate for 1 to 4 hours in the
refrigerator.

Remove crab from marinade 15 minutes before cooking. Grill the halves
and the shell over a hot fire until outer shells are bright red and
meat in the largest sections is opaque (pry one open to check), 3 to
4 minutes per side.  Or , place crab halves and shell in a roasting
pan lightly oiled with a bit of the marinade and roast in a 450F oven
until done as described above, about 12 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile,
strain vegetables out of marinade and combine with the butter in a
saucepan. Simmer for 5 minutes and season to taste. Serve in small
bowls as a dipping sauce for the crab.

Serves 2.

Rock Shrimp Tamales With Four-Pepper Cream

shrimp, southwestern

1  for the tamales--
8 large dried corn husks*see
1  notes
1  masa dough--
1/4 cup unsalted butter softened
2 cup masa harina
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon minced chipotle in adobo
1/4 cup canola oil
1 cup hot chicken or shellfish
1  stock
1  for the filling--
2 slice bacon -- finely diced
2 tablespoon red bell pepper -- minced
2 tablespoon green bell pepper- minced
2 tablespoon yellow bell pepper --
1  minced
2 tablespoon red onion -- minced
1 teaspoon garlic -- minced
1/2 cup chicken or shellfish stock
1/2 teaspoon adobo sauce from canned
1  chipotles above
8 oz coarsely chopped rock shrimp
1  more if needed
1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro
1  four pepper cream (recipe
1  follows)
1  garnish--
1  cilantro sprigs
1  diced bell peppers

TO MAKE THE TAMALES: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the
paddle attachment, or by hand with a wooden spoon, beat the butter
until light and fluffy. Add the masa harina, baking powder, salt and
chipotle. Mix until well-blended. With the motor running, slowly add
the canola oil and the hot stock. Continue mixing until you hear a
slapping sound, approximately 2 minutes. The dough will be soft. Set
aside. You can do this all by hand with a wooden spatula,but it will
take some energy! TO MAKE THE FILLING: In a large saute pan over
medium heat, saute the bacon until translucent. Add the peppers,
onion and garlic and saute slowly until tender, approximately 3
minutes. Add the stock, shrimp and adobo sauce. Cook, stirring, until
the shrimp are barely cooked through, approximately 1 minute. Remove
from the heat, strain, set the solids aside, and return the liquid to
pan. Over high heat, reduce the liquid until syrupy and add to the
shrimp mixture. Add the cilantro and stir to combine. TO ASSEMBLE THE
DISH: Remove the husks from the water, drain, and pat dry. Spread out
the corn husks on a dry work surface. Pinch off an egg-size piece of
the masa

mixture. Pat it into the corn husk, flattening the dough to
approximately 4 inches square and 1/4-inch thick, leaving a border of
husk at least 1/2-inch wide around the perimeter of the dough. Spread
a tablespoon of the filling lengthwise in the center of the dough.
Fold the husk together until the edges overlap and the masa and its
filling are completely enclosed by the husk. Gently flatten the top
and bottom of the husk and fold the ends up to enclose. Repeat with
the other 7 husks. Place folded side down in a steamer over boiling
water and steam, covered, for 45 minutes. TO SERVE: Open the husks to
reveal the tamales and place on a warm plate. Spoon the Four-Pepper
Cream over the tamales and garnish with cilantro sprigs and diced
peppers. Serve immediately. Yield: 4 servings FOUR-PEPPER CREAM 1
tablespoon olive oil 3/4 cup minced shallots 2 teaspoons seeded and
chopped serrano chiles 1 cup dry white wine 2 1/2 cups rich shrimp or
chicken stock 3/4 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons finely diced red bell
pepper 2 tablespoons finely diced yellow bell pepper 2 tablespoons
finely diced green bell pepper Kosher salt and freshly ground white
pepper Drops of fresh lemon or lime juice In a medium saute pan, heat
the olive oil and saute the shallots and serranos until soft but not
brown. Add the wine and stock and bring to a boil. Continue to boil
until the mixture is reduced by half. Add the cream and continue to
boil until the mixture is reduced to a light sauce consistency. Stir
in the diced bell peppers and season to taste with salt, pepper and
drops of lemon juice. Serve warm. (Four-Pepper Cream can be made up
to a day ahead, stored in the refrigerator, and reheated gently in a
water bath.) Copyright, 1996, TV FOOD NETWORK, G.P., All Rights

Rudderfish Poached In Marsala

fish

1  stephen ceideburg
4  pieces rudderfish
1 tablespoon olive oil
2  cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 tablespoon chopped parsley
1/2 cup marsala
1  orange, juice and zest
1/4 cup fish stock

Fish stock can be made when you have the time, frozen in ice- cube
trays, then the cubes transferred to a freezer bag for storage until
you need them. If worst comes to the worst, the Knorr brand has
instant fish-stock cubes, which can often be found in the "exotic"
section of large supermarkets.

In a pan large enough to take 4 serving size pieces of rudderfish in
one layer, heat a tablespoon of olive oil and gently fry 2 finely
chopped cloves of garlic and a tablespoon of chopped parsley. Add
half a cup of marsala. the juice and zest of an orange and a quarter
cup of fish stock. Bring to a simmer and slide in 4 serving-size
pieces of rudder fish. Poach just until the fish flakes, turning once
if necessary, and remove the pieces to warmed plates. Turn up the
heat to high and boil the liquid fiercely till it has reduced by at
least half

Pour the sauce over the fish and serve.

Ryba W Sosie Chrzanowym

fish, holidays, polish

      ----FISH----
2  carrots
2  celery stalks
1  parsley root
1  onion, quartered
5  peppercorns
1  bay leaf
2 teaspoon salt
6 cup water
2 lb fish fillets (carp, sole, pike or s; imilar fillets)
      ----SAUCE----
3 tablespoon butter
3 tablespoon flour
3/4 cup horseradish, prepared, cream-style
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup sour cream
2  eggs, hard-cooked, peeled and sieve; d

Combine vegetables, dry seasonings and water in a saucepan or pot.
Bring to a boil; simmer 20 minutes, then strain.

Cook fish in the strained vegetable stock 6 to 10 minutes, or until
fish flakes easily.  Remove fish from stock. Arrange on serving
platter and cover with plastic wrap. Chill. Strain fish stock and
reserve 3/4 cup for horseradish sauce; cool.

For horseradish sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan, then blend in
flour until smooth, making what the French would call a roux. Add the
cooked fish stock gradually, stirring constantly. Cook and stir until
the sauce boils and becomes thick and smooth.

Remove from heat and stir in horseradish, sugar, salt, sour cream and
eggs. Cool for 15 minutes.  Pour the horseradish sauce over the
chilled fish and garnish with shredded lettuce.

NOTES:

*  Fish in horseradish sauce -- This recipe is the first of the 12
dishes that make up the traditional Polish Christmas-eve meal, which
is eaten after sundown on Christmas eve. The Polish word for
Christmas eve is Wigilia (pronounced VI-gee-lee-ah). Its root is like
the English vigil: waiting for Christ to be born. At the end of the
Wigilia meal the family goes off to midnight mass at church.

There are usually 12 dishes in a Wigilia meal to symbolize the 12
apostles, though some families serve 13 because they include Christ
in their count. The meal starts when the first star can be seen; this
symbolizes the star of Bethlehem. Although The Wigilia is meatless
(Advent, the season of penance, continues until midnight), it is
still festive and delicious. The tradition of Wigilia, though
centuries old, is still current in Poland. There is no fixed set of
rules for what the 12 (or 13) dishes must be; the items in the meal
change somewhat according to location and availability of ingredients.

Nevertheless, all of the dishes are traditional, and in addition
there are many traditions for the serving of the meal. For example,
some people place straw under the tablecloth to symbolize the manger
in which Christ was born. Most families set an extra place, for the
stranger who might be passing by. This is my family's traditional
Wigilia meal:

: Fish in horseradish sauce
: Pike Polish style
: Pickled beets
: Pickled herring in sour cream
: Stewed sauerkraut with mushrooms
: Christmas eve kutia
: Almond soup
: Noodles with poppy seed and raisins
: Poppy-seed rolls
: Christmas bread
: Baked apples with red wine
: Marzipan
: 12-fruit compote

With this first recipe you will notice a similarity with my last
name. Now you know a word of Polish (namely chrzan = horseradish i.e.
hot stuff).

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  1 hour.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.  Experiment.

Salmon & Shiitakes Steamed In Romaine

seafood

1  marinated salmon:
1 lb salmon fillets
2 tablespoon bottled hot or regular
1  teriyaki sauce
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon finely chopped mint
1  vegetables:
1 teaspoon canola or vegetable oil
1/4 lb shiitake mushrooms, stems
1  trimmed, wiped cleaned,
1  thinly sliced
1/2  inch piece gingerroot,
1  peeled and minced
2 teaspoon finely minced mint
1 tablespoon bottled hot teriyaki sauce
8 large romaine leaves, cleaned,
1  thicker part of rib removed
1  steaming liquid:
6 cup water
1/2 cup packed mint leaves
1/2  lemon, thinly sliced
1  inch gingerroot, thinly
1  sliced
1  sauce:
4 tablespoon bottled hot teriyaki sauce
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh mint

1. To prepare the marinated salmon: Cut salmon fillet crosswise into 4
pieces; pour into a glass pan.  Combine two tablespoons teriyaki
sauce,
lemon juice and mint.  Pour over the salmon and refrigerate one
hour.

2. To prepare the vegetables: Heat oil over a nonstick skillet set
over
medium heat.  When hot, add the mushrooms and ginger; saute until
softened, about four minutes.  Add the mint and 1 tablespoon
teriyaki
sauce and bring to a boil.  Saute 1 minute.  Remove from the pan.

3. To prepare the steaming liquid: Put the water, mint, lemon and
ginger
into a large pot and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat slightly so
that
the liquid remains at a low boil.  Fit a steamer basket or rack
over
the top.  Lay the romaine leaves on top, cover and steam 4 minutes,
until wilted.  Remove the lettuce from the steamer.

4. Remove the salmon from the marinade. (Discard the marinade.) Spoon
the
mushrooms over each piece of salmon and wrap each in 2 of the
steamed
romaine leaves.  Place on the steamer and steam twelve minutes per
inch
of thickness.  Test the salmon in the center for doneness.

5. While the salmon is steaming, prepare the sauce: Stir together the
teriyaki sauce, lemon juice, sugar and mint.  Serve on the side of
the
salmon.

Salmon Consomme With Bites

fish, soups

213 gm canned red alaska salmon
100 gm whole prawns
600 ml vegetable stock
1 small onion - un-peeled and quartered
1  bay leaf
2  egg whites
8  thin slices of carrot - blanched -; and cut into flowers
2 tablespoon sherry, optional

Drain the juice from the can of salmon into a saucepan. Break the
fish into flakes putting the bones and skin into the saucepan with
the juice but setting the flakes to one side.

Peel the prawns. Put the heads and shells into the saucepan and set
the prawns to one side with the salmon flakes. Add the vegetable
stock, onion and bay leaf to the saucepan. Bring to the boil. Reduce
heat, cover and simmer for 45 minutes. Remove the consommé from the
heat and strain it into a jug through a sieve which has been lined
with damp muslin. Wash out the pan and return the consomme to the
saucepan, once again passing it through a sieve, lined with clean,
damp piece of muslin.

Whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Place the consomme
over moderate heat and bring to the boil. Whisking gently, add the
egg whites, a spoon at a time into the stock. When the mixture boils,
simmer gently for 10 minutes, without breaking the crust of egg white
which will form over the top.

Allow to stand for 5 minutes before straining it for a final time
through a sieve lined with dampened muslin. Re- heat the soup before
serving in bowls along with the flakes of salmon, shelled prawns,
carrot flowers and sherry, if used.

Salmon Coulibiac

russian, seafood

2  (15xl2-inch) sheets puff pastry
1  rice filling, chilled (recipe follo; ws)
1  mushroom-spinach filling, chilled (; recipe follows)
1 1/2 lb poached salmon, boned and flaked, c; hilled
1  egg
2 teaspoon half and half
2  (lox4-inch) sheets puff pastry

Salmon coulibiac is a traditional Yule holiday dish in Russia because
it looks like a present: red (salmon) and green (spinach), all
gift-wrapped in puff pastry. This dish would also be ideal on a New
Year's Eve or Twelfth Night buffet. Here's a salmon coulibiac from
Just Off Melrose caterers in Hollywood.

Cucumber-Dill Sauce (recipe follows)

Place 2 (15xl2-inch) puff pastry sheets side by side on floured
board. For each puff pastry, spoon 1/4 Rice Filling evenly over
center of each pastry. Add Mushroom Spinach Filling evenly on top of
rice mixture. Distribute flaked salmon evenly over mushroom mixture.
Top each with remaining Rice Filling.

Beat egg with half and half in small bowl to make egg wash. Brush
edges of pastry with egg wash. Fold pastry lengthwise, overlapping
edges. Tuck ends to seal. Turn over, seam-side down, onto greased
baking sheet. Make cutouts from remaining (lOx4-inch) puff pastry
sheets, using pastry cutters. Place on top and sides of pastry roll.
Make vent in center of roll and brush entire surface and cutouts with
egg mixture. Bake at 350 degrees 45 minutes, or until golden brown.
Remove and allow to cool 10 minutes before slicing. Serve hot or at
room temperature with Cucumber Dill Sauce. Makes about 10 servings.

Rice Filling

2 tbs butter 1/2 cup chopped shallots 2 cloves garlic, minced 3 cups
cooked rice 1 bunch fresh dill, chopped

Melt butter in skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and garlic.
Saute until shallots are tender. Add rice and dill and mix well.

Mushroom-Spinach Filling

1/4 cup butter 1 onion, chopped 1/2 pound mushrooms, sliced 1/4-inch
thick 1 (IO-ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and
squeezed dry Salt, pepper

Melt butter in small skillet. Add onion and saute until tender, about
1 minute. Add mushrooms and spinach and cook 3 minutes. Season to
taste with salt and pepper.

Cucumber-Dill Sauce

2 tbs butter 1/4 cup minced shallots 1 1/2 tsp flour 1 cup half and
half 1 cup sour cream 1/2 cup chopped fresh dill Salt, pepper 1/4 cup
grated peeled cucumber

Melt butter in small skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and saute
until translucent. Stir in flour and cook 1 minute. Stir in half and
half and simmer until slightly thickened. Add sour cream and dill.
Season to taste with salt and pepper. Heat through, but do not boil.
Add cucumber just before serving. Makes 2 1/2 cups.

Salmon Coulibiak

fish, main dish, russian, vegetables

14 oz pkg. frozen puff pastry
17 1/2 oz can cohoe salmon
1/2 lb fresh mushrooms - finely chopped
1/2 cup finely chopped onion
3 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 teaspoon lemon juice
3 large eggs plus
1  egg yolk; for pastry glaze
1  chicken stock
3 cup long-grain rice - cooked in chicken; stock
4  fresh dill sprigs
1  salt and pepper; to taste
1 cup medium-thick bechamel sauce*

*Well-seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg and tarragon.

Thaw puff pastry in refrigerator overnight.

Flake salmon, discarding bones but reserving juices to add to white
sauce.

Mince mushrooms and onions; saute in butter and lemon juice until
liquid has evaporated.  Chill (or freeze) in airtight container, if
preparing in advance.

Hard-cook the 3 eggs.  Peel and slice.

Make the bechamel sauce, adding juice from salmon.

Lightly grease a large cookie sheet (12 x 18"); set aside. On pastry
cloth, roll out pastry dough to form a rectangle about 12 x 15" and
about 1/4" thick.

To assemble the dish, build layers along the center of dough as
follows. Season each well.  Spoon on: half the rice; half the
mushroom-onion mixture; 1/3 the white sauce; all the flaked salmon;
1/3 white sauce; fresh dill sprigs; sliced eggs; rest of
mushroom-onion blend; rest of white sauce; and rest of rice.  (Note:
The rice absorbs cooking juices and keeps pastry from being soggy.)
Season top.

Fold dough over filling, folding and turning up ends. Cut off any
excess dough.  Seal pastry edges on top and at each end with egg yolk
glaze (one egg yolk mixed with a little milk or water). I like to
shape the dough into a fish shape, head and tail at either end. Brush
pastry with glaze.

Carefully lift ends of pastry cloth and roll coulibiak over onto
greased cookie sheet so seam is on the bottom.

Decorate top with cutouts of leftover dough (make eyes, fins and
scales if desired).  Be sure to put several slits into the pastry to
allow steam to escape.  Assembled coulibiak can be refrigerated up to
several hours before baking if necessary.

Bake in a preheated 400 F. oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until crust
is golden and juices start to appear. Watch crust carefully. If
browning too quickly, turn heat down to 375 F. and cook 10 minutes
longer. Allow to stand 10 minutes at room temperature.

To serve, loosen bottom of coulibiak with 2 spatulas and slide onto a
heated platter or serving tray. Slice into crosswise pieces to serve.
Good served with a crisp tossed salad.

Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

Enright writes: "Former cooking school instructor Stephanie Woroshyl
taught me how to prepare this elegant Russian dish...Most of the
steps can be done a day or two in advance, making it ideal for
impressive entertaining."

Salmon Couscous

fish, main dish, pasta

418 gm canned red alaska salmon
250 gm couscous
900 ml hot water
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
2  garlic cloves; crushed
1  green or red chili pepper  de-seede; d, finely chopped
1 teaspoon caraway seeds
1 large onion; chopped
2  courgette  trimmed & thickly sliced
2  carrots; trimmed and sliced
1  red or orange pepper  de-seeded and; sliced
300 ml vegetable or chicken stock
1/4 teaspoon salt
3  tomatoes; thickly chopped
15 gm margarine or butter
2 tablespoon pumpkin seeds

[If you do not have a couscousier in which to cook this recipe,
improvise by using a saucepan and colander. Line the colander with a
muslin cloth, allowing the sides of the cloth to hang over the edge.
Roll up the hanging muslin to make a collar around the edge of the
colander. During the method, the base of the couscousier is
equivalent to the saucepan and the top to the lined colander.]

Drain the can of salmon, reserving the juice. Set aside.

Soak the couscous for 20 minutes in a large bowl of hot water. Heat
the oil in the base of the couscousier, stir in the garlic, chilli
pepper, caraway seeds, onion, courgette, carrot and pepper. Cook
gently for 5 minutes. Add the salmon juice and stock to the
vegetables. Put the top of the couscousier on and place the soaked
couscous into it. Season with salt. Cover with a lid and steam for 30
minutes.

Remove the top of the couscousier and add the tomatoes and salmon.
Heat for 5 minutes. Place the couscous onto a large serving plate and
gently stir in the margarine and the pumpkin seeds. Pile the salmon
alongside to serve.

Salmon Dilly

fish

1  salmon fillet or steak
1/2 cup half-and-half or milk (or less)
1/2 teaspoon minced fresh dill, chopped chives,; or basil salt (optional)

This is the easiest way I know to cook tender and delicate salmon.
It's especially good prepared with fresh dillQbut if you prefer
chives or basil, it's still a delightful dish.

Preheat oven to 350!F. Place salmon in shallow baking dish and add
half and-half or milk so fish is half immersed. Sprinkle with dill,
chives or basil, and salt if desired. Bake 30 minutes, occasionally
spooning some of the half-and-half or milk over salmon. Check for
doneness; when fish is predominately pale pink but is still a

Salmon En Croute

fish

12 oz white fish haddock, whiting or cod
6 oz fresh white breadcrumbs
1  juice and grated rind of 1 lemon
1 tablespoon snipped fresh chives
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1  egg
4 tablespoon sunflower oil
1 lb ready-made puff pastry, thawed, if; frozen
2 large salmon fillets
1  egg, beaten, to glaze
1  seasoning

Ask your fishmonger to fillet a 2 1/2 salmon and keep the bones and
trimming for the lemon cream sauce.

Pre-heat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Put the white fish, breacrumbs,
lemon juice and rind, chives, parsley, egg and oil in a food
processor. Whizz until smooth, then season to taste. Roll out the
pastry to a long, oval shape 6 inches longer than the salmon and 2
1/2 times as wide. Place a fillet in the centre of the pastry, spread
over the white fish paste and sandwich with the other fillet. Cut
diagonal lines along each side of the puff pastry about 1/2 inch
apart, leaving 3 inches at each end uncut. Bring the sides together,
criss-cross the cut strips over each other and secure them with
beaten egg. Fold one end into a triangle to make the shape of a fish
head and cut a wedge from the other end to make the shape of a tail
Lift fish on to a greased baking tray. Brush pastry with beaten egg
and bake for 35-40 minutes. The fish is ready when a skewer inserted
between the plaits comes out clean.

Serve on its own or with "Cucumber Sauce (barry)" or "Lemon Cream
Sauce (barry)".

Salmon Fillets With A Horseradish Crust

appetizers, fish

1 1/2 lb salmon fillets skinned
1  flour, for dredging
1 tablespoon vegatable oil
1 tablespoon butter
1  seasoning
1  cooked buttered spinach to
1  serve
1  **for the chive sauce**
250 ml double cream
1 teaspoon dijon mustard
1 teaspoon prepared english mustard
1 teaspoon creamed horseradish
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon snipped fresh chives
1  **for the crust**
2 tablespoon creamed horseradish
1  egg yolk
3 1/2 oz course fresh breadcrumbs
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

1. Make the sauce: Boil the cream in a pan for 2 minutes until
slightly thickened.  Remove from the heat and whisk in the dijon and
English mustards, horseradish and lemon juice; cover and set aside.

2. Prepare the salmon: if there are any bones remaining, remove them
with a pair of tweezers.  Cut the fish into 4 equal portions, season
each piece and dredge with the flour.

3. Prepare the crust: mix the horseradish and egg yolk on a plate.
Dip the top of each piece of salmon in the horseradish mixture (or
brush it on with a pastry brush), making sure that it is generously
coated. Mix together the breadcrumbs and parsley and dip the coated
side of the fish in the mixture. Using your hands, shape the crust by
gently but firmly manipulating the coating mixture.

4. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.  Heat the oil in a heavy-based
frying pan until very hot.  Add the salmon, crust side down, and the
butter and cook for about 3 minutes until the breadcrumbs are turning
nicely crisp. Turn over the salmon and place, crust side up, in an
ovenproof dish. Bake in the oven for 5 minutes, then remove and check
that the salmon is cooked.

5. Add the chives to the sauce.  Reheat briefly over a low heat, but
do not allow to boil as this will spoil the flavour.

6. Lay a bed of buttered spinach on each of four warmed plates and
top with salmon.  Surround the salmon and spinach with the sauce and
serve immediately.

Salmon For Louise

fish

12 oz fillets of salmon dusted with flour
1/4 cup clarified butter
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon minced shallot
2 tablespoon julienne-cut roasted red christy pe; ppers
1 teaspoon chopped cilantro
1/2 cup sliced chanterelle mushrooms
1/4 cup dry sherry
1/4 cup fish stock
1/4 cup cream
2 tablespoon madeira creme fraiche cilantro spri; gs

Dust 2 6 oz fillets of salmon with flour. Shake off excess flour. In a
saute pan, heat clarified butter. Add fillets, and brown on one side;
turn. Add garlic, shallots, red peppers and chopped cilantro and
mushrooms. With fillets still in pan, deglaze with dry sherry. Add
fish stock. Reduce over hight heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Add cream.
Reduce until sauce thickens. Remove salmon  to heated serving plate.
To the sauce still in the pan, add 2 to 3 Tablespoons Madeira. Cook
only a minute more, long enough to evaporate the alcohol. Lace salmon
with sauce, garnish with a dollop of creme fraiche and a sprig of
cilantro.

***NOTES: When I made this dish, I didn't have fresh chanterelles, so
I used a couple of dried Shitake mushrooms which I soaked in hot
water for about 10 minutes before I rinsed and sliced them. I also
didn't use any cilantro because my husband hates it. I would have
loved it myself! The most important note to this recipe is NOT to
overcook the salmon. I cooked it until brown on the bottom, flipped
it, proceeded with the recipe, but removed the salmon right after
deglazing the pan in order to prevent the sa lmon from over an
overdry quality that is most unpleasant and a tremendous waste of a
good piece of fish. I used only the tail fillets for this dish,
eliminating the "bone" problem. I also had no idea exactly what a
Christy red pepper was, so I used some really lovely roasted red
pepper. The fish stock I made with the head, bones and tail of the
fish and added some celery, onion and peppercorns and bay leaf to the
fish stock, cooking it only 20 minutes to prevent bitterness of the
stock. I also strained the stock through cheesecloth to eliminate the
grey cloudy pieces. From the files of Al Rice, North Pole Alaska.

Salmon In Pesto Sauce

chinese, seafood

3 tablespoon lemon juice
3 tablespoon rice vinegar
3 tablespoon light soy sauce
2 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon crushed sichuan peppercorns
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black popper
1 tablespoon dry sherry
1 tablespoon sesame oil
2 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
2 tablespoon peanut oil
1 lb salmon fillet, in i or 2 pieces
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2  cloves garlic, peeled and minced
2 tablespoon minced scallions
1 tablespoon minced cilantro

Check this one out.  It has "pesto" in the title, but has no basil in
it and is a Chinese recipe.  Hmmm...

In a small bowl, combine lemon juice, rice vinegar, 2 Tbs. light soy
sauce, sugar, salt, Sichuan peppercorns and black pepper. Set aside.
In a separate bowl, combine remaining I Tbs. soy sauce, Sherry,
sesame oil and 1 Tbs. ginger.  Rub fish with mixture and marinate for
at least 20 minutes. (This can be done several hours in advance.)

Fill a large pan with water and bring to rapid boil. Meanwhile, place
a layer of foil in a Chinese steamer tray, covering tray except for 1
inch around edges to allow steam to circulate. Rub foil with a little
peanut oil.  Lay salmon on foil in tray and place tray over boiling
water. Cover and steam salmon until light pink, just firm to touch
and flakes when tested with fork. (A 1/2-inch-thick fillet should
take about 5 minutes.)

In a small bowl, combine cornstarch with 1 Tbs. cold water. Place a
10-inch saute pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 Tbs. peanut oil. When
hot, add remaining ginger and garlic. Saute for 15 seconds, then add
lemon juice mixture.  Bring to slow boil, stir in scallions and
cilantro, then stir in small amount cornstarch mixture to lightly
thicken sauce. Remove from heat.

When salmon is cooked, remove steamer tray and lift fish out on foil.
Slide fish onto platter or dinner plates. Spoon sauce over fish.
Serve at once.

Serves 2 as a main course, 6 as part of a multi-course Asian dinner.

NOTE:  Salmon is excellent served at room temperature or eaten cold
while you stand in front of the refrigerator. The pesto sauce is good
on any steamed, baked, broiled, or grilled firm-fleshed fish fillet.

1 1/4 lb skinless salmon fillet
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
1/4 cup cold water
1/2 cup thinly sliced mushrooms
3 cup fish stock (or clam juice)
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 tablespoon gelatin
3  shallots, peeled and thinly
2 tablespoon brandy
1 dash tabasco
2 1/2 cup whipping cream, cold
2 cup watercress leaves
2 tablespoon fish stock
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
3/4 cup mayonnaise
      ----  ~ FOR THE SAUCE: HEAT THE OVE

salmon into 1/2-inch cubes, and place in a single layer in a medium
oven-proof skillet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and set aside.
Sprinkle the gelatin on the cold water to soften, and set aside.
Bring the fish stock to a boil. Pour the boiling stock over the
salmon in the pan and cook over medium-high heat until the stock
returns to a boil. Transfer to the oven and bake, covered with a
sheet of buttered parchment or waxed paper, for 1 to 2 minutes. The
salmon should remain pink inside. Strain the mixture, reserving the
salmon and stock in separate bowls. Melt the butter in a medium
saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook the mushrooms and shallots until
tender, about 2 minutes. Pour in the brandy, turn the heat to high
and light the alcohol with a match. Cook over high heat until the
liquid in the pan is reduced by half. Add the reserved stock and
reduce again by half. Remove from heat, and stir in the gelatin.
Combine the reserved salmon, strained liquid, and Tabasco in a food
processor and puree until smooth. Cool refrigerated until room
temperature, but do not allow it to set. Whip the cream until stiff
peaks form, and fold into the salmon mixture. Pour into a
9-by-5-by-3-inch glass loaf pan, cover with plastic wrap and chill a
minimum of 6 hours or as long as 2 days to set the mousse. To make
the sauce: Place all ingredients except mayonnaise in a blender and
puree until smooth. Transfer to a mixing bowl and stir in mayonnaise.
To serve: Run a knife along the inside of the pan. Dip the pan's
bottom into hot water for a few seconds. Turn over onto a serving
platter. Cut into 1/2-inch slices, and serve with the watercress
sauce.

Salmon Patties

fish

1 lb salmon, canned (either pink or red)
1 pinch salt
1 small onion, diced
1/4 cup bread crumbs, plain or spiced
2  eggs
1 teaspoon lemon juice

Mix all of the ingredients together in a bowl.  Form into patties
about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick and 2 1/2 - 3 inches diameter. This
should make about 8 patties. Fry in oil or butter until brown and
crispy, or bake in a well-greased pan at 400 degrees until brown
(about 15 minutes).

NOTES:

*  Snack or Main Course -- This is a very nice finger food, great for
lunch on a hike. Or they can be served hot as a main course.

*  I usually make a double batch.

*  These are great either hot or cold.  If you take them out of the
freezer in the morning and put them in your backpack, they'll be just
right by lunchtime.

: Difficulty:  easy, especially if you like squishing stuff with your
hands.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 15 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.

Salmon Poached In Champagne With Capers & T

fish, low cal, low fat

1 1/4 lb salmon fillets
2 cup champagne
1/4 cup fresh-squeezed lemon juice
1/2 medium yellow onion; sliced
1 tablespoon capers
4  5-inch sprigs fresh tarragon
1  several grinds of pepper

Rinse the fillets and place in a shallow pan large enough to hold
them in one layer.  Add the champagne, lemon juice, and enough water
to just cover the fillets. Remove the fish and bring poaching liquid
to a boil. Lay the fish back in the pan in a single layer and top
with the onion slices, capers, tarragon, and pepper. Reduce heat to
low, cover, and simmer 4 to 6 minutes, depending on the thickness of
the fish. Fish is done when mostly opaque but still barely
transparent at the very center. Remove fish from the liquid, along
with onions, capers, and tarragon. Drain well and serve immediately
on warmed plates. This is nice with a wild rice pilaf and a tossed
green salad.

baking dish and keep warm. Deglaze pan with a little of the wine and
scrape the residue from the pan over the fish. Meanwhile, in a small
saucepan, melt the butter and add the garlic and spices. Cook,
stirring over medium low heat, for 2-3 minutes to extract the
flavors. Remove from heat and add the wine and lemon juice. Pour this
sauce over the fish. Bake at 400 degrees F. for 10 minutes. Serve
over rice, spooning pan juices over all. Garnish with lemon wedges
and finely chopped parsley.

Variation: Substitute dry white wine for the Marsala for a lighter,
less rich dish.

Salmon Spinach Pie

appetizers, seafood

12 oz salmon; steamed
1 lb frozen chopped spinach; cook
2 1/2 cup bechamel sauce
2  hard-boiled eggs
1 tablespoon chopped parsley
1 teaspoon dill
1  salt
1  fresh ground black pepper
8 oz puff pastry; thawed, if froz ----for g
1/2  beaten

Cook the frozen spinach in a little salted water as directed on the
package.  If using fresh spinach you will need to cook approximately 2
pounds.

Drain well and line the bottom of a buttered pie plate.

Mix the cooked, boned and skinned salmon with the bechamel sauce and
chopped hard-boiled eggs.  Mix in the dill and parsley and pour the
mixture on top of the spinach.

Roll out the puff pastry 2 inches larger than the pie plate. Cut a 1
inch wide strip from the outer edge of the pastry. Brush the rim of
the plate with water and fit the pastry strip around. Lift the
remaining piece of pastry over the rolling pin and transfer to the
pie plate. Press the edges together and trim with a sharp knife held
at an angle away from the dish. To seal the edges firmly together
hold the knife horizontally towards the pie plate and make a series
of shallow cuts round the edge. Flute the edges with the thumb and
forefinger and pull in the flutes with the back of a knife.

To make decorative leaves for a savory pastry pie, cut remaining
pastry into 1.5 inch strips using the rolling pin or ruler as a
guide. Every 2.5 inches cut the strips at an angle to make diamond
shapes. Press lines on the diamonds to make the veins of the leaves.

Make a hole in the middle of the pie by making a cross with a knife
and fold back each part, arrange the leaves in a decorative pattern
around the middle and brush with beaten egg.

Bake in a pre-heated 425 oven until pastry is well risen and golden
brown - approximately 30 minutes. Cover with foil or waxed
grease-proof paper if pastry shows any sign of browning too much.

Serves 4.

Salmon Steaks In Herb Blankets

seafood

4  salmon steaks, 3/4 thick
4 oz butter
1  lemon
1  fresh parsley, chives, mint,
1  lemon thyme and tarragon - (or herb; s of your choice)

Choose a gratin or baking dish which will take the steaks side by
side and use some of the butter to grease it thickly. Put the fish
into it and season with a squeeze of lemon, a generous grinding of
black pepper and a little salt.  Cover and set aside in a cool place
until ready to cook.

To cook, simply dot the fish with the remaining butter, cover
with foil and bake at 375-400 F (190-200 C) gas mark 5-6 for 20 to 25
minutes until the fish is hot and tender. While it cooks, chop
coarsely and mix together heady handfuls of aromatic herbs.  I would
probably use something like 8 tablespoons parsley, 6 of chives, 4 of
mint and no more than 2 teaspoons each of lemon thyme and tarragon.
You may prefer to use a little dill or fennel in place of tarragon,
or to concoct some quite different cocktail of your own.

Scatter nearly half the herbs on a warm serving dish and lay the
fish steaks on a bed of herbs. Scatter more herbs over the fish,
spoon on the buttery cooking juices then the remaining herbs. Serve
with wedges of lemon and steamed new potatoes.  (Other vegetables are
best served as a separate course.)

Salmon Steaks W/ Black Bean Sauce

fish, oriental, sauces

      ----BLACK BEAN SAUCE----
3 tablespoon salted fermented black beans
3  garlic cloves; chopped
1 teaspoon minced peeled ginger
2 tablespoon soy sauce
2 tablespoon dry vermouth
1/2 teaspoon sugar
6  green onions
6 slice fresh peeled ginger (quarter-sized); , shredded
6  salmon steaks (1 thick)  blotted dr; y
2 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoon peanut or corn oil
1  white pepper to taste
1  handful of fresh coriander (leaves)

SOAK BLACK BEANS in lukewarm water for 5 minutes. Drain, rinse with
cold water; drain. Combine black beans with garlic, ginger, soy
sauce, dry vermouth and sugar; gently mash together. Cut 3 green
onions into 2-inch-long sections and cut 3 into 2-inch-long slivers.
Put green onion sections and half the shredded ginger on bottom of a
shallow heatproof plate (like a glass Pyrex pie plate). Sprinkle
salmon with salt. Place salmon steaks in a single layer on top of
green onions. You may need to use 2 plates with a 2-tier steamer
unit. Scatter remaining shredded ginger. Top each steak with 1/2
tablespoon of the black-bean mixture and half the green onion slivers
equally over the steaks.

Fill a wok or steamer with enough boiling water to come within 1 inch
of the bottom of bamboo steamer. When the water comes to a boil, put
the fish with its plate into the bamboo steamer. Cover. Steam over
medium-high heat for 10 minutes. When done, remove cover away from
your face and carefully lift out the plate. In a small pan heat the
peanut or corn oil until hot and almost smoking. Sprinkle salmon with
white pepper and scatter the remaining fresh green onion slivers on
top. Carefully pour the hot oil over the fish steaks. It should
sizzle. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves. Serve hot with steamed
rice.

Salmon Sushi

japanese, seafood

2 1/4  parts vinegar
2  parts salt

Filet out the he middle portion from back to front. Marinate for one
day in a mixture of salt and 5% vinegar until the surface of the fish
is "cooked" (like seviche). Freeze overnight and then slice thin and
serve. I didn't get the proportions of salt and vinegar but I am
assuming that it is very similar to what I use for pickling fish.

Salmon With Basil Cream Sauce

fish, seafood

2 lb salmon fillets
1 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter
3  shallots, peeled and minced
1  garlic clove, peeled and minced
1 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
3/4 cup dry white wine
1/2 cup light cream
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste

From "Gourmet Gazelle Cookbook" by Ellen Brown (Bantam Books, 1989,

Cut the salmon into 6 equal serving pieces, wash, and pat dry on paper
towels. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Sear the salmon on each side for 2-3 minutes, keeping the center

from the pan. Remove the fish from the pan with a slotted spatula and
keep warm. Reduce the heat to low and add the shallots and garlic to
the pan. Saute, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes.

Add the basil, parsley, wine, cream, lemon juice, pepper and salt to
the pan and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the
mixture is reduced by half. Taste for seasoning, adding pepper and
salt as needed.

To serve, reheat the fish slightly in the sauce and the serve the
sauce around the salmon fillets.

NOTE: The fish can be prepared up to three hours in advance. Reheat
the fish in the sauce over low heat, uncovered, for 10 minutes.

Salmon/Trout Hollandaise

fish, sauces

1 1/2 lb trout fillets
      Hollandaise Sauce-----
2 tablespoon water
6  peppercorns -- slightly
1  crushed
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
2  egg yolks
3/4 cup butter
1  salt -- to taste
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Cut fillets into serving-size portions.  Steam over salted water for
9-10 minute or until fish flakes when tested with a fork. Remove from
heat. Carefully remove fish to heated platter and keep hot.

Make the sauce in a double boiler or an oven-proof bowl over a
saucepan of hot water.  If using the latter method make sure that the
bottom of the bowl is not touching the hot water or the sauce will
set on the bottom of the bowl before it is cooked.

Place the water, crushed peppercorns and white wine vinegar in a small
saucepan and reduce to about 1 tablespoon of liquid. Set aside.

Cut the butter into pieces and soften gently in a small saucepan.
Remove from heat.

Whisk the egg yolks, reduced liquid and a little of the butter in the
double boiler.  When the mixture becomes creamy and slightly thick,
pour in the butter in a thin stream, whisking briskly. Add lemon
juice and a little salt, and taste for seasoning.

Remove from the heat immediately when it is thick. Should the sauce
look as if it is curdling, add a few drops of cold water and whisk
briskly for a few more minutes. This sauce can be made in a blender
or food processor, but you may find that less butter will be
absorbed. The addition of 1 tablespoon of cold water with the lemon
juice will prevent it becoming too thick.

Pour the sauce over the fillets and serve.

Serves 6.

Salmon-Asparagus Manicotti

cheese, fish, italian, pasta

16 oz pkg manicotti - (mine had 14 tubes)
1 lb farmer cheese -- (or ricotta
1  cheese)
1  salmon steak -- about 1/2 lb
1/2 lb fresh asparagus
1 can cream of asparagus soup
1  milk
1  salt and pepper
1  parmesan cheese

Cook the manicotti according to package directions, drain and cool.
Set aside.

Poach the salmon steak (in broth or whatever), let cool, remove skin
and bones, and crumble the flesh into medium-small pieces. Trim the
bottoms of the asparagus and chop the green parts into 1/2"-1"
pieces. You don't have to cook them beforehand.

Combine the cheese, salmon flakes, asparagus and salt and pepper to
taste in a large bowl. Combine cream of asparagus soup with 1 can of
milk and add some of the resulting prepared soup to the cheese
mixture. The stuffing should be soft but not runny. Use this to stuff
each tube of manicotti. Place them side-by-side in a shallow baking
dish. Pour the rest of the soup over the pan and sprinkle Parmesan
cheese on top. Bake at 350 for 25 minutes or so. Serve with, what
else, more steamed asparagus!! YUM! (Asparagus was on sale for
$1.29/# at Giant last week so I got a bunch. It was the pencil-thin
kind, too, not those big woody things we'll be getting later on.

Salmon-Spinach Loaf

fish

1 lb salmon (1 large can)
3/4 lb spinach, fresh
2  eggs
2 tablespoon onion, grated
10 3/4 oz mushroom soup, condensed (1 can)
1 cup cornflakes (uncrushed)
1/4 cup flour, all-purpose

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Rinse spinach thoroughly. Cook
spinach with a small amount of water for 5-10 minutes, or until
tender. Discard cooking water.

Clean salmon as desired and drain excess liquid. Place salmon,
spinach, eggs, undiluted soup, cornflakes, flour and onion in large
mixing bowl. Beat with electric mixer at medium speed for about three
minutes or until ingredients are chopped and mixture is blended. Stop
to scrape bowl and beaters as needed.

Grease a 9x5x2 1/2-inch loaf pan and pack the mixture in. Bake for 40
to 50 minutes or until set and lightly browned. Cool slightly before
serving. Do not try to unmold; serve directly from baking pan. The
finished loaf will have the consistency of spoonbread.

NOTES:

*  A baked salmon and spinach loaf -- This recipe is a pleasant
compromise between a salmon loaf and a spinach souffle. It can be
made with stale spinach and canned salmon. It does not have a strong
flavor or texture of spinach, as do some cooked spinach dishes.

*  You can substitute concentrated dried cream-of-mushroom soup for
canned condensed soup, or use a thick flavored white sauce.

*  There is no point in using good-quality salmon in this recipe;
chum or pink salmon are fine.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking and cooling.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

Salted-Cod Pudding

fish

1 lb cod, salted
1/4 cup rice
1 1/4 cup milk
3 large eggs
1  butter

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Boil the salted cod until fully
cooked. Take it out of the water and leave to cool. Skin the fish,
de-bone it and make a stew out of it in a bowl, not adding anything.

Boil the rice and mix it with the fish in the bowl to make a good
mixture.

Beat the eggs and mix it with the milk.

Put the fish/rice mixture in a heat-resistant dish in which you have
spread the butter.  Pour the milk/egg mixture over it and put it in
the oven for 40 minutes.

NOTES:

*  A rich pudding with salt cod, eggs and milk -- This was cooked on
a TV program a few days ago and is very nice.

*  Icelandic saltfish is mostly exported to Spain, Portugal and Italy,
where it is used in Christmas main dishes. Here in Iceland we just
boil it, and usually eat it with boiled potatoes and boiled turnips,
cut in pieces. As the fish is a bit dry we use butter with it, and
sometimes brown bread.

*  If you cannot get salt cod, you can make your own by salting a cod
fillet and leaving it in the salt, refrigerated, for 3 or 4 days,
then wash thoroughly.

San Felipe-Style Fish Tacos In Beer Batter

fish, mexican, sauces

2 lb firm-fleshed fish fillets
1/2 cup unbleached flour
2  eggs -- separated
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3/4 cup beer -- room temperature
3/4 cup unbleached flour
2 cup canola oil
18  fresh corn tortillas
1  salsa blanca:
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup plain yogurt -- or sour
1  cream
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cup shredded cabbage -- napa
1  rosarito beach salsa:
1/2 cup oil
10  chiles de arbol
2  tomatoes
1/2 cup tomato sauce -- canned
1/2 teaspoon salt

Cut fish into strips about 2 inches wide and 3 inches long. Roll in
the 1/2 cup flour, dust off excess. Set aside while mixing batter.
Beat together egg yolks, seasonings, beer and the 3/4 cup flour until
well blended. Whisk egg whites until they resemble soft whipped
cream, then fold gently into batter. Set aside. This batter holds up
quite well for up to 1 hour. Heat oil in flat-bottomed wok or cast
iron skillet. Dip floured fish pieces in the beer batter and
carefully slip into hot oil. Fry unto fish turns a deep gold, turning
so it browns evenly. Remove to crumpled paper towels to drain. Warm
corn tortillas on a griddle placed next to wok or skillet. (Or in
oven.) For the salsa blanca: Blend mayonnaise, yogurt and salt. Makes
1 cup. For the Rosarito salsa: Heat oil in a small cast iron pan and
fry the chilies in in it until they are a deep burnished red. This
step gives the salsa an incomparable smoky flavor. Remove to paper
towels and blot off oil. While the chilies are cooling, broil the
tomatoes about 5 minutes, turning once. Remove cores and most of the
skin. Stem chilies and break pods into pieces. Place tomatoes, tomato
sauce, salt and chilies in the bowl of a food processor: process
until chilies are broken up into small, dark flecks. Use for tacos
and over eggs. Makes 1cup. Spread a scant tablespoon of Salsa Blanca
over warm tortilla, add a heaping tablespoon of shredded cabbage and
press into sauce. Add 2 or 3 chunks of fried fish and drizzle
withRosarito Beach Salsa. Eat immediately. Makes 18 tacos.

vegetables in boiling water for 3 seconds. Plunge in cold water and
squeeze dry.

5) Beat 2 eggs.  Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of cornstarch
(mixed with 1 tablespoon of water).
Make into a thin pancake (about 10 inches).  Remove cooked pancake
and cut it into a large square.

6) Sprinkle some cornstarch on the pancake.  Spread 1/2 of shrimp
mixture evenly over pancake and sprinkle some more cornstarch on it.
Spread the vegetable leaves and rest of the shrimp mixture on it.
Finally, put the shredded mushroom shreds into 2 rows along the two
ends. From these two ends, slowly roll pancake toward the center and
paste together with some shrimp paste. Place upon oblong dish and
steam for about 8 minutes.

7) Remove and cut into slices.  Arrange on plate attractively. (You
may make a flour-batter: mix with some eggs flour, cornstarch and
cold water. Dip the whole shrimp roll into the mixture and deep fry
until golden brown, then cut into slices).

NOTE: Laver and ham shreds may be used in place of the vegetable
leaves and black mushrooms.

Sardines On A Roll

sandwich, seafood

2 can (4 oz each) maine sardines
1 cup ketchup
2 tablespoon onion; chopped fine
1 1/2 teaspoon oregano
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
6  hamburger rolls
2 tablespoon butter; softened
1 1/2 cup cheese; shredded

Drain sardines and cut into large pieces.  Combine ketchup, onion,
oregano, and garlic powder.  Mix thoroughly. Cut rolls in half and
spread with butter. Place rolls on a cookie sheet and toast them
lightly in the oven. Place sardines on rolls and cover with ketchup
mixture. Sprinkle with cheese.  Bake in a moderate oven, 350 F for 10
to 15 minutes, or until cheese melts.

Dave's notes:  Dump the ketchup, oregano, and garlic powder and open
up a jar of Ragu Pizza Quick Sauce, adding the onions. It tastes a
lot better than the "dumbed down" tomato sauce Uncle Sam came up with
using ketchup.

Sashimi (Sliced Raw Fish)

fish, japanese

      ----CHOOSE ONE (ONE PIECE----
1 lb fresh sea bass fillet
1 lb squid
1 lb turbot
1 lb tunny fish
1 lb halibut
1 lb abalone
1 lb bream
      ----DIPPING SAUCE----
4 tablespoon soy sauce -or-
1 single tosa joyu
1 single chirizu   -or-
      ----GARNISH----
1 single 2 secion diakon
1 each celery
1 each carrot

CUTTING THE FISH: There are 4 basic cuts for Sashimi. A Very sharp,
heavy knife is a must. 1.  Hara Giri (Flat Cut)  Most popular cut.
Suitable for any filleted fish.  Holding the fish firmly, cut
straight down in slices about 1/4" to 1/2" thick and 1" wide,
depending on the size of the fillet.

2.  Kaku Giri (Cubic Cut)  This style of cutting is more often used
for tunny fish.  Cut the fish as above, the cut the slices into 1/2"
cubes.

3. Ito Zukuri (Thread Shape)  Although this technique may be used
with any small fish, it is especially suitable for squid. Cut the
squid straight down into 1/4" slices, the cut lengthways into 1/4"
wide strips.

4.  Usu Zukuri (Paper Thin Slices)  Place a fillet of bass or bream
on a flat surface and, holding the fish firmly with one hand, slice
it at an angle into almost transparent sheets.

TO SERVE: Sashimi may be composed of one fish or a variety of fish. To
serve as part of a meal, arrange the fish attractively on individual
serving plates.  Garnish each plate with obout 1/2 teaspoon of wasabi
and decorate with strips of daikon, carrot and/or celery. Cover with
a sheet of plastic and refrigerate for NO MORE THAN 1 HOUR before
serving.
Pour the dipping sauce of your choice into tiny dishes and
accompany each serving of Sahshimi with it's own sauce. The wasabi
may be mixed with soy sauce or tosa joyu to taste. To serve as an
hors d' oerve, arrange two or more varieties or cuts of sashimi on a
serving dish and accompany with dipping sauce.

Saumon Roti A L'effilochee D'endives

disney, fish

2  salmon filets; 8oz ea
1 tablespoon olive oil
1  salt and pepper to taste
1 lb endives
1 1/2 tablespoon butter
1  salt, pepper, lemon juice to taste
      ----RED BELL PEPPER SAUCE----
1 1/2 tablespoon shallots; finely chopped
1/2 cup white wine
1/3 cup fish stock
2/3 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup red bell pepper; very finely chopped

SAUCE: In a saucepan, saute shallots in a teaspoon or so of butter
until transparent. Add white wine and reduce (simmer) the mixture
until it reaches a pasty consistency (about half an hour). Add fish
stock, heavy cream, and red bell pepper.  Simmer slowly until creamy
(40 minutes or so, depending on desired consistency).

ENDIVES: After washing endives, cut in two lengthwise, then remove
tough centers and bases.  Cut julienne style into very thin strips
and stack together. Melt butter in a large frying pan and add
endives. Saute for about half an our at medium heat until cooked
through. When finished, the endives should be soft, moldable,
brownish, almost transparent, and their sharp bitterness should be
replaced by a milder taste. Lightly salt and pepper, then ass a
little lemon juice.

SALMON: Preheat oven to 400 degrees, and stove to high heat. In a
non-stick frying pan, heat olive oil to very hot, then sear the
aslmon on both sides until brown.  Salt and pepper both sides of
salmon, place in a roasting pan and roast for about 5 minutes.

DISH DISPLAY: PLace half the sauteed endives on the left side of the
plate in a rounded, flattened shape to createa "carpet" on which to
place the salmon.  Using half the sauce, pour most of it on the lower
portion of the plate, drizzle some of it around and endivces and save
the rest. Place a salmon filet on top of the endive "carpet" and pour
the remaining sauce portion over the salmon. Serve with colourful
steamed vegetables (placed on the remaining third of the plate) if
desired, and French bread on the side.

Sauteed Catfish With Ginger Peach Sauce

main dish, sauces, seafood

      ----GINGER PEACH SAUCE----
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 teaspoon ginger, ground
16 oz peaches, sliced; drained
1 cup fruit spread, peach
1 tablespoon catsup
1 tablespoon vinegar, white wine
      ----CATFISH----
1/2 cup flour
1 tablespoon thyme leaves; crumbled
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper, black
1 1/2 lb catfish fillets
2 tablespoon oil
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup pecans, chopped

You may use 1-1/2 c peeled sliced fresh peaches instead of the canned
peaches.

Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; add ginger and stir
1 minute. If using fresh peaches, add and cook, stirring
occasionally, until peaches are fork tender, about 2 minutes. Add
canned peaches, if using, and preserves; stir until jam melts. Stir
in catsup, vinegar and hot pepper sauce. Transfer mixture to a
blender or food processor and whirl until peaches are coarsely
chopped. (Sauce can be cooled and refrigerated up to 2 weeks) To
serve, warm sauce, stirring, in a sauce pan over medium heat.

Makes about 2 cups.

In a medium size bowl or pie plate, combine flour, thyme, salt and
pepper. Rinse fish and pat dry. Dredge fish in flour mixture; shake
off excess and lay fillets in a single layer on a plate. In a 10 to
12 inch frying pan over medium heat, heat oil and butter; add pecans
and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer nuts to paper
towels to drain. Add fish to pan, without overlapping (you may need
to cook in 2 batches) Cook until fish is crisp and golden on bottom,
about 4 minutes; turn fillets over and cook until fish is opaque and
tender in center of thickest area, another 4 minutes. Transfer fish
briefly to paper towels to drain then arrange on plates. Spoon about
3 Tablespoons warm Ginger Peach Sauce over each serving; sprinkle
with pecans.

Makes 4 servings.

Ginger Peach Sauce is a nice counterpoint to the savory crispness of
the fish. Keep some around to try with fried catfish, fried oysters
or grilled shrimp.

Sauteed Salmon Scallops With Greens

appetizers, seafood

2 lb spinach, fresh
1 1/2 lb salmon fillets; skinless
1  salt
1  pepper
3 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, yellow; finely chopt
2  garlic clove; pressed
3 tablespoon lemon juice
3 tablespoon parsley, fresh; minced

Wash greens thoroughly and remove tough stems; cut leaves into thin
strips and set aside.  Rinse salmon and pat dry. Hold knife at an
angle and slice salmon into 4 or 8 equal pieces. Place each piece of
fish between 2 pieces of waxed paper, the cut sides against paper,
and pound gently with a mallet or rolling pin to create slices of
even thickness (about 1/8 inch thick). Season scallops of salmon with
salt and pepper if desired. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a
5- to 6-quart pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and stir until
tender but not brown, about 4 minutes. Stir in the garlic and greens;
cook, stirring, until the greens are just tender, about 3 minutes.
Transfer greens to a bowl and keep warm. Heat about 1 teaspoon of the
remaining oil in the pan, or in a 10- to 12-inch frying pan, over
medium-high heat. Add scallops to pan in a single layer (you will
cook salmon in several batches) and cook until edges turn opaque, 20
to 30 seconds.  Turn scallops and cook other side about 15 seconds.
Lift cooked salmon from pan and keep warm. Repeat with remaining
scallops, adding additional oil if necessary to prevent sticking.
When scallops are cooked, add the lemon juice to the pan and scrape
the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen browned bits.
Stir in the parsley and set aside. To serve, divide greens among
warmed plates, top with 1 or 2 of the salmon scallops, pour the pan
sauce over each serving.

Sauteed Shrimp With Tomato-Basil Vinaigrette

main dish, seafood

16 large shrimp
1  salt
1  pepper; freshly ground
      ----TOMATOBASIL VINAIGRETTE----
6  plum tomatoes (about 1 lb.); peeled, seeded, and diced
2 medium shallots; minced
2  garlic cloves; blanched and cut into jul
3 tablespoon basil (fresh); chopped plus 4 whole spri
1 tablespoon parsley (fresh); minced
1  salt
1  pepper; freshly ground
1 tablespoon good wine vinegar
1 tablespoon lime juice
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil; plus
2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
      ----EQUIPMENT----
1  small bowl
1  10 skillet

Santa Barbara shrimp, found in the Pacific Ocean, are most prized for
their taste and their size.  They are usually sold with head and tail
intact. However, Gulf shrimp make a good substitute.

1. Remove the heads of the shrimp and peel the shell, leaving the tail
intact.  Season lightly with salt and pepper and set aside.

2. Prepare the vinaigrette: In a small bowl, combine the tomatoes,
shallots, garlic, basil, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper.
Stir in the vinegar, lime juice, and 1/2 cup olive oil, and mix well.

3. Heat a 10" skillet and pour in the remaining 2 tablespoons olive
oil. Over medium-high heat, cook the shrimp, in batches, if
necessary, about 1-1/2 minutes per side. Do not crowd the pan. Do not
overcook -- well-done shrimp will become dry.

Presentation: Spoon vinaigrette into the center of each of 4 plates.
Arrange 4 shrimp on the vinaigrette and garnish with basil sprigs.
Serve immediately.

To prepare ahead: Through step 2, but season the shrimp when ready to
serve.

Savory Egg Custard With Clams & Shrimp

chinese, seafood

1/2 cup juice from canned clams
1 1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1 teaspoon oil
1 teaspoon rice wine
1 teaspoon light soy sauce
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1 pinch white pepper
4  eggs
1/2 cup canned whole baby clams
3 tablespoon chopped chinese garlic chives, or g; reen onions
6 medium shrimp, shelled, deveined
1 teaspoon oyster sauce

This steamed egg dish exemplifies the simplicity of Chinese home
cooking it takes about 5 minutes to prepare. The Chinese use a heat-
proof porcelain shallow bowl 7 inches wide by 3 inches deep with
sloping sides to steam this egg dish.  A 1 quart ceramic souffle dish
or a Pyrex bowl works just as well. To ensure a smooth, silky
texture, avoid high heat when steaming.

Combine the clam juice, chicken broth, oil, wine, soy sauce, sugar and
pepper in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Remove from heat; cool
completely.

Lightly beat the eggs in bowl.  Slowly stir the cooled broth mixture
into the eggs until thoroughly mixed. Avoid over-beating.

Scatter the clams and 2 tablespoons of the chives in the bottom of a
1quart heat-proof bowl.  Strain the egg mixture through a fine mesh
sieve over the clams.

Bring the water in a steamer to a boil over high heat. Place the bowl
on a rack above the boiling water. Cover, reduce heat to a gentle
boil, and steam for 2 minutes, or until the eggs begin to set.

Carefully remove cover from steamer, and scatter the shrimp on top of
the custard.  Cover and steam for 5 minutes longer, The custard is
done when a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.

Carefully remove bowl from the steamer.  Drizzle with oyster sauce and
garnish with remaining chives.  Spoon over rice. Serve hot.

Serves 4 to 6.

ethnic, seafood

10 oz sea scallops, rinsed
1 tablespoon egg white, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon white pepper or to taste
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 lb green beans, trimmed & cut i to 1/4; -inch pieces
2 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened
1 3/4 cup creme fraiche
1/3 cup parmesan cheese, grated
3/4 cup tomato coulis (see recipe)

In a food processor with a metal blade, puree the scallops with the
egg white, salt, white pepper, and nutmeg. Transfer the puree to a
metal bowl and chill, covered, for 1 hour. In a saucepan, blanch the
green beans in boiling salted water to cover, for 6 minutes. Drain.
Toss the beans with 1 Tbsp butter, season them with salt and white
pepper to taste and reserve. Set the bowl of puree in a larger bowl
of ice water. Beat in 1 cup of creme fraiche, 1/4 cup at a time,
until it is incorporated and the mousse is fluffy.  Fold in the green

Scallop & Pine Nut Sauce With Spaghettini A

italian, pasta, seafood

1 lb bay scallops
1/4 cup olive oil; extra-virgin preferred
2 medium garlic cloves; minced
1/3 cup pine nuts (pignoli)
2 tablespoon salt plus
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 lb spaghettini
1  stick (4 oz) unsalted butter melted
3/4 cup packed fresh basil leaves; coarsely chopped

Wash the scallops.  Remove the tough tendon on the side and dry well
on paper towels.

In a large saucepan or flame-proof casserole, heat the oil. Add the
garlic and cook over moderately low heat until softened but not
browned, about 3 minutes.  Add the pine nuts, increase the heat to
moderate and cook, stirring frequently, until the nuts are lightly
browned, about 2 minutes. Remove the sauce from the heat and season
with 1/2 tsp. of the salt and all of the pepper.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Add the remaining 2
tablespoons salt and the spaghettini. Cook the pasta until al dente,
8 to 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, add the scallops to the garlic and pine nut sauce. Cook
over high heat, tossing frequently, until the scallops are just opaque
throughout, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and season with an
additional pinch of salt and pepper.

Drain the spaghettini, add to the scallops and toss. Add the butter
and basil and toss again.  Serve hot. Makes 6 to 8 servings. Source:

Scalloped Salmon Or Trout

seafood

1/2 lb cold cooked salmon or trout  (sea o; r river trout)
1/2 lb florentine fennel  (trimmed weight)
1/2 lb steaky bacon
2 oz butter
1 1/2 oz flour
1/2 pint whole milk
1/4 pint fish stock
1  lemon juice
1  dijon mustard
1  toasted or fried breadcrumbs

Serves 8 as an appetizer, or 3-4 as a main course.

Trim the fennel in the usual way, scraping away fibrous threads with a
potato peeler, or remove and discard the outer layers if they are
tired-looking or tough. Chop the flesh into small chunks and toss in
1/2 oz melted butter.  Half cover the pan and leave to cook gently
for 10 minutes just shaking the pan occasionally. Add the bacon, cut
into snippets, increase heat and cook, stirring frequently, for
several minutes until the bacon is cooked and the fennel is steaked
with gold. Season with a good squeeze of lemon and plenty of pepper,
and set aside to cool before mixing with the fish, which should be
broken into large chunks.

Make a sauce with 1-1/2 oz each butter and flour, the milk and the
stock, and simmer gently, half covered, for about 10 minutes. Away
from the heat, season with scant 1 teaspoon mustard, a little salt
and plenty of pepper. Gently fold in the fish mixture and divide
between 8 small scallop shells or cocottes or put it all into one
large gratin dish. Cover with foil and reheat in the oven straight
away, or if preparing ahead, set aside in a cool place until close to
serving time. If the mixture is cold when it goes into the oven, it
will probably need 25 minutes or so at 425 F (220 C) gas mark 7 to
become thoroughly heated through. Stand the dish(es) on a pre-heated
baking sheet to help speed things up. When thoroughly hot, remove the
foil and sprinkle the fish mixture generously with freshly toasted or
fried breadcrumbs immediately before serving.

Scallops & Cashews In Tangerine Sauce

california, chopstix, main dish, seafood

      ----SCALLOPS----
2 cup raw cashews
2 cup cooking oil (what!? -km)
4  green onions; finely minced
4  garlic cloves; minced
1 lb bay scallops
      ----SAUCE----
1/4 cup dry sherry
3 tablespoon tomato sauce
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
1 tablespoon oriental sesame oil
1 teaspoon red wine vinegar
2 teaspoon chinese chili sauce
2 teaspoon grated tangerine peel (or finely mi; nced instead)
      ----TO FINISH----
1 tablespoon cornstarch

This recipe can be adapted beautifully to be vegetarian! I love this
dish with cubed tofu instead of scallops, and if you can't find a
vegetarian oyster sauce, just substitute a bit of soy sauce or
experiment with your favorite Asian sauce.  -KM

ADVANCE PREPARATION:  Place the nuts and oil in a small saucepan over
medium-high heat.  Stir the nuts occasionally and when they turn very
light golden, drain immediately and pat dry on paper towels. Pour off
and reserve 2 tablespoons of the cooking oil for stir-frying.

Set aside in separate containers the green onions, garlic, and
scallops. In a small bowl, combine the sauce ingredients and mix well.

LAST-MINUTE COOKING:  Combine the cornstarch with an equal amount of
cold water.  Set aside.

Place a wok over highest heat.  Whent the wok is very hot, add the
reserved oil to the center.  Roll the oil around the sides of wok and
add the garlic.  When it just begins to turn white, in about 15
seconds, add the scallops.  Stir-fry until the scallops just lose
their raw outside color, about 1 minute.

Stir in the green onions and pour in the sauce.  When the sauce comes
to a low boil, stir in a little of the cornstarch mixture so that
sauce glazes the scallops. Stir in the cashews, then taset and adjust
the seasonings. Spoon onto a heated platter or individual plates.
Serve at once.

Scallops Fenton

seafood

3 lb scallops
1 1/2 cup dry white wine
2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
3/4 lb mushrooms; sliced
1  small green pepper; sliced
1/4 cup butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1  dash fresh ground pepper
4 tablespoon flour
1 cup diced swiss cheese
1/2 cup grated romano cheese
1 cup heavy cream, whipped
2 tablespoon butter for topping
1  paprika

Bring wine and lemon juice to boil and add scallops, mushrooms, and
green pepper. Simmer just until scallops are tender. Be careful not to
overcook!!! Drain, reserving liquid. Melt butter in saucepan,
blending in salt, pepper, and flour until bubbly. Gradually stir in
reserved liquid and cook until thickened. Add Swiss cheese and 1/2 of
the Romano and stir over very low heat until blended. Remove from
heat and fold in whipped cream. Stir in scallop mixture, then divide
between eight, individual, buttered scallop shells/baking dishes.
Sprinkle tops with remaining Romano, dot with butter and sprinkle
with pap- rika. Broil until golden brown. Watch them carefully so as
not to burn!!!! This, as you may guess, is sinfully rich and
deliciously bad for you. Scallops themselves, however, are very low
in cholesterol. If you would also like to try some plainer, New
England-style scallop recipes, just let me know. Yours in good food
and good fellowship! FROM: DAVID SAWYER (RJHV41A)

Scallops St.Jacques~ A La Provencal

seafood

6 tablespoon butter
1/4 cup finely chopped yellow onion
2 tablespoon finely chopped green onion
2 teaspoon finely chopped garlic
1 cup flour
1  salt and pepper
1 1/2 lb scallops, cut into 1/4-inch slices
2/3 cup dry white wine
1/4 teaspoon thyme
1  bay leaf
1/3 cup grated swiss cheese

"...For those who love a harmony of softly blended flavors with the
faint suggestion of seafood..."

Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a skill over medium heat. Add the
onions, green onions and garlic. Cook, stirring often, for about 5
minutes, or until the onions are tender but not browned. Using a
slotted spoon, remove the onions and garlic and set aside.

Put the flour, salt and pepper on a large piece of waxed paper, and
stir with a fork to mix well.

Dip the scallop slices into the flour mixture and coat well. Shake off
excess flour.

Melt 2 tablespoons of the remaining butter in the skillet and quickly
saute the scallops in it until they are lightly browned. Lower the
heat and add the wine, thyme, bay leaf and onion mixture. Cover and
simmer for 5 minutes.

Remove the scallops with a slotted spoon and spread them in a layer
in a shallow baking dish.  (I use a 10-inch pie plate, but you may
use 4 large scallop shells, if you prefer).

Briskly boil the scallop cooking liquid for about 1 minute to reduce
and thicken it.  Pour the sauce over the scallops. (This may be made
early in the day and covered and refrigerated until just before
serving.) About 3 minutes before serving, sprinkle the cheese over
the scallops, dot with remaining butter, and run under the broiler
just long enough to melt the cheese and lightly brown it. Serve hot.

Serves 4.

Scallops~ Grapefruit & Fried Rice

seafood

2 cup cooked long grain rice
4 tablespoon soy sauce
3 tablespoon oil
1 small onion; finely diced
1  ear of corn, kernels only
1 small red pepper; finely chopped
1/2 lb snow peas; finely chopped
1 tablespoon dark sesame oil (optional)
1 1/2 lb bay scallops
1/2 cup grapefruit juice
2 tablespoon unsalted butter

COOK THE RICE IN THE normal way and chill in the refrigerator for at
least 6 hours. Toss the rice with the soy sauce and set aside. Heat 2
tablespoons oil in a large skillet or fry pan. Add the onions and
cook 1 minute. Add corn and peppers and cook, stirring, another 2
minutes. Add the snow peas and cook 30 seconds. Add rice and cook,
stirring, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Mix in the sesame
oil and arrange the rice in a ring on a serving platter. Keep warm in
a 250F oven while cooking the scallops. Heat remaining tablespoon oil
in a large non-reactive skillet over high heat until almost smoking.

bottom of the skillet. Add the grapefruit juice. Cook about 30
seconds, then remove the scallops, using a slotted spoon, and reserve

Scapice - Marinated Anchovies

fish, italian

1  stephen ceideburg
1 kg anchovies
3 tablespoon flour
1  salt and pepper to taste
1 cup white wine
3  cloves garlic, crushed
2  birdseye chillies
3 tablespoon mint

Just about every cuisine of Europe has a recipe for oily fish steeped
in vinegar or lemon and served cold. In Spain it is escabeche. The
English have soused herrings. In southern Italy, they make scapice.

Remove the heads and gut 1 kg fresh anchovies. Wash them and set
aside on kitchen paper to dry.

When they are dry, heat oil for deep-frying. Put 3 table- spoons plain
flour in a paper or plastic bag and add salt and pepper. In batches,
put the anchovies into the bag and shake until they are coated with
seasoned flour. Shake off excess flour, then deep-fry. Drain the
cooked anchovies and lay them in a large shallow pan.

In a saucepan heat a cup of white wine vinegar with 3 cloves of garlic
crushed, 2 birdseye chillies halved lengthways and 3 tablespoons mint,
finely chopped. When the mixture comes to the boil, spoon it over the
fish. Cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 24 hours, turning
the fish midway.

Serve as an antipasto with crusty bread.

Seafood & Yellow Rice

grains, seafood

1 lb scallops
1 lb shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/2 lb crab meat
2 can clams (and juice)
1/2 cup onion, chopped
1/4 cup bell pepper, chopped
1/2 cup margarine
1  chicken stock (or bouillon) and wat; er, to make 4 cups
1 tablespoon celery, chopped
1  parsley, chopped
1  garlic, minced
1  salt, to taste
1  black pepper, to taste
1  msg
2 cup mushrooms, sliced
2 cup rice, raw
1  saffron (1/2 vial), shredded

Saute onion and bell pepper in margarine until translucent. Add water
(and some chicken stock) and a hint of garlic. Add celery, parsley,
salt and MSG. (Water that comes out of seafood will make another 1/2
cup of liquid.) Add mushrooms and clams; cover and bring to boil over
medium-high heat.

When water comes to rolling boil, put in rice and bring back to
LOWEST boil possible.  Add saffron; cover pot and don't touch it for
15 minutes. Rice should be cooked, but not split at ends yet --> a
little on the dry side. Dump in all the seafood and stir thoroughly.
Bring back to a simmer; cover and cook 10 minutes. Might need to cook
a little longer with the top off if the shrimp exude a lot of liquid.
Check seasonings; can add more butter or pepper.

Mom's notes:

*  Might want to add oysters, too.  Don't drain the clams!

*  If you use canned mushrooms instead of fresh, add them when you
put in the seafood.

Seafood Chowder

fish, soups

1  onion; medium, minced
1 tablespoon butter
1 1/2 teaspoon thyme
1 1/4 teaspoon celery salt
2 cup whipping cream
9 oz haddock or halibut fillets
6 oz scallops; chopped
3 oz lobster meat; cooked & chopped
3/4 cup sour cream
3  potatoes; peeled, cooked and diced
1 1/4 cup milk salt pepper
1  paprika for garnish

"A traditional Atlantic chowder is made with fish or shellfish, canned
milk, potatoes, onions and is served with a dollop of butter. This
version, which comes from a Nova Scotia fisherman and uses sour
cream, fresh cream and thyme, is quite different and very good. When
reheated leftover chowder, it may be necessary to add a little more
milk or cream, because the fish and potatoes will have absorbed some
of the liquid."

Cook the onion in the butter until transparent. Add the thyme and
celery salt. Remove from heat. In a saucepan, pour the whipping cream
over the fish fillets.Cover, bring to a boil and simmer slowly for 10
minutes or till the fish flakes easily. Remove the fish with a
slotted spoon, then break into small pieces and remove any bones. Add
the onion mixture and the scallops to the poaching liquid. Bring to
barely a boil, then simmer for about 1 minute or till the scallops
are opaque. If the chowder is not to be eaten immediately,
refrigerate everything at this stage. Just before serving, add the
fish, lobster, sour cream, potatoes and milk. Heat through, but do
not allow to boil. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle into soup
bowls. Sprinkle with paprika. Serve immediately. SERVES: 4-6

Seafood Gumbo

seafood, soups

2 lb shrimp
1 pint oysters
1/2 lb crabmeat, fresh or frozen
2 tablespoon oil
2 tablespoon flour
3 cup okra, or 1 t gumbo file'
2 each onions, chopped
1 can tomatoes, 16 oz.
2 quart water
1 each bay leaf
1 teaspoon salt
3 each garlic pods (optional)
1/8 teaspoon red pepper (optional)

Peel shrimp before cooking & devein. Make a roux... use oil and
flour in a heavy iron skillet. Over medium-low heat, place flour in
the oil and let cook , slow , until the flour starts to brown. Adjust
heat so that the flour does not burn. You want the flour to turn dark
brown, stir as needed but, keep dat flour from burning.
When you are satisfied that the roux is as dark as possible without
burning, add the cleaned shrimp to it for a few minutes, stiring
constantly. Set the shrimp/roux mixture aside.
Smother okra in another 2 T of oil, along with the chopped onions.
Add can of tomatoes when the okra is nearly cooked. Then add water,
bay leaf, garlic, salt and pepper. Add shrimp and roux to this
mixture and let cook slowly for 20-30 minutes.
Add oysters and crabmeat, cook for another 10-15 minutes.
NOTE: If ya don't use okra, you can use gumbo file', which is crushed
sassafras leaves, available in the spices rack of the grocery store.
When using file' instead of okra, add it only after the heat is
off... don't simmer or boil file'... it gets stringy. Let gumbo stand
a few minutes after adding file' before serving. Serve over cooked
rice.

Seafood Lasagna *** (Dtcm33b)

italian, main dish, seafood

1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cup garlic; crushed
2 cup milk
2 cup chicken broth
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon basil
2 cup mozzarella cheese; shredded

2/3 cup cooked shrimp \cut into bite
2/3 cup cooked bay scallops  /   siz
2/3 cup crabmeat            /
1/3 cup dry white wine

This was originally posted 5/5 by Patti Anderson.
I've just made it once, but we loved it and it will probably be a
family favorite. Heat butter in a large saucepan over low heat until
melted. Add garlic.
Stir in flour and salt.  Cook, stirring constantly until bubbly.
Remove from heat.  Stir in milk, broth and white wine. Return to
stove and heat until boiling, stirring constantly. Boil for one
minute. Stir in mozzarella, onions, basil and pepper.  Cook over low
heat until cheese is melted, stirring constantly. Spread about 1 1/2
cups of the sauce in an ungreased 9X13 pan.  Top with uncooked
lasagna noodles, overlapping as needed.  Spread cottage cheese over
the noodles. Spread with another 1 1/2 cups of sauce, and then with
another 5 noodles. Top with seafood and another round of sauce.  Add
last 5 noodles and top with all remaining sauce.  If desired top with
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 350 deg. for
35-40 minutes or until the noodles are tender. Let stand for 15
minutes before cutting. When I made this, I just used 1 cup each of
shrimp and faux crab meat, and skipped the scallops.
The "crab" was just fine.  I mashed the cottage cheese, since I
don't like the texture of curds.  Next time I'll use ricotta. Make
sure when you measure the last sauce that you leave at least 1 1/2
cups for the top, so you don't have crispy noodle tips exposed.
Also, we didn't want to overlap the noodles so much, so we just
broke them to make a complete layer.
Hope you like this as much as we did! FROM: HEIDI MCCULLOUGH

Seafood Pancakes

appetizers, breakfast, cakes, pancakes, seafood

1 cup flour
1  pinch salt
1  egg, lightly beaten
4 teaspoon oil
1 1/2 cup milk plus 1 tbsp
1/2 lb monkfish
6  scallops
3/4 cup milk
2  garlic cloves, chopped
1/2 lb shrimp, shelled
2 tablespoon butter
3 tablespoon flour
1/4 cup light cream
1 cup gruyere cheese
2 tablespoon parsley, fresh, chopped
1  salt and pepper
1 1/2 tablespoon oil for frying

Servings: 10

Make pancake batter by mixing flour and salt in mixing bowl. Make
well in center and pour in the egg, 4 tsp oil and 1 cup milk. Whisk
to smooth batter then add remaining milk.

Remove any skin from monkfish, rinse and cut into bite-size pieces.
Pat dry. Rinse and pat dry scallops, cut in half. Pour 3/4 cup milk
into saucepan, add garlic and bring to simmer.  Add all fish except
shrimp. Simmer for 5-6 minutes then add shrimp. When shrimp turn pink
remove all fish to a bowl and set aside. Strain fish milk and reserve
for sauce. Place butter in saucepan and melt, add flour and stir for
2 minutes, then pour in reserved milk and the cream. Continue to stir
and simmer for a few minutes until you have a smooth sauce. Turn heat
to low, add cheese and parsley and season to taste with salt and
pepper. Add fish, mix well.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Place small frying pan or omelet pan over high heat. Lightly grease
it with a little oil. Beat pancake batter, then pour 3 Tbsp into pan.
Turn pan so bottom is covered evenly with batter and cook for 40-60
seconds, turn and cook 30-40 seconds longer. Transfer to large plate.
Continue with remaining batter. (There should be enough filling for
10 pancakes.) Place an equal amount of filling (about 3 Tbsp) in
center of each pancake, fold the sides over filling and arrange in
ovenproof dish just large enough to hold pancakes. Place in oven for
20 minutes, or until the pancakes are hot through.  Serve immediately.

These thin pancakes, which conceal a tasty mixture of fish, will
appeal to the masked and mysterious side of the Cancerian, who when
in need of refreshment and quiet will reture into his or her own
protective shell. These can be served as a first course or as a
luncheon dish for four, with a green salad and a very chilled white
wine.

Seafood Pita

sandwich, seafood

1/2 lb scallops or shrimp
1/4 cup olive oil
1 medium onion
1  garlic cloves (more or less to tast; e)
3/4 cup mushrooms
1 1/2 cup vegetable (such as eggplant or zucc; hini)
1  salt, pepper and spices (to taste)
1 1/2 cup couscous, cooked
1  pita bread

Cut up the vegetables into small (about 1/2 inch) cubes. Slice the
mushrooms.

If using shrimp, peel and de-vein the shrimp and cut into small cubes.

In a small amount of olive oil, saute the onion and the optional
garlic until the onion is soft but not quite transparent.

Heat the remaining olive oil in a skillet and add the vegetable and
mushrooms. Saute until the vegetables are almost soft. Taste and add
salt, pepper and whatever spices strike your fancy (oregano, basil
and red pepper are good). Add the scallops or shrimp and cook until
just done, about a minute or two. Scallops will turn opaque and
shrimp will turn pink. Do NOT overcook.

There should be an excess of oil and fluid.  If not, add more oil and
briefly heat. Transfer the mixture to a bowl. Add the couscous and mix
thoroughly. Chill several hours or overnight.

Stuff into the pita bread (maybe with some tomato) and serve.

NOTES:

*  Pita-Seafood Salad Sandwiches -- This recipe is more of a formula
than a recipe.  It is excellent for a cool dinner in the summer (any
time after February in Texas!) Yield: Serves 2-4.

*  You could substitute almost any vegetable and crab or a firm fish.
To use this for a picnic, don't stuff the pita bread until you are
about to serve it. Err on the side of too much oil, since the
couscous absorbs the oil (and a recent study says that olive oil may
be good for you).

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, overnight chilling.
: Precision:  no need to measure.

Seafood Quesdilla & Salsa

sandwich, seafood

1 small whole wheat tortilla
1 tablespoon salsa (see recipe below)
1/4 cup cooked flaked crab meat
1  or 5 cooked medium shrimp,
1  sliced
1 oz shredded jack cheese
2 tablespoon canned, diced green chiles
      ----SALSA----
1 1/2 cup diced tomatoes
1 tablespoon chopped cilantro*
1/4 cup chopped green onions
1/4 cup chopped, mild chile
2 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1  salt & pepper to taste

In small bowl combine all ingredients for salsa. Cover tortilla with
salsa. On half of tortilla spread seafood, cheese and chiles. Fold
tortilla in half to enclose filling. Cook in non-stick skillet, or
place under broiler until cheese is hot and bubbly.  Turn tortilla to
brown both sides. Cut into 4 wedges. (It looks like more food!) Serve
with extra salsa if desired.

NOTE:  If you prefer, omit the seafood and count just 1 meat card for
the cheese.  Also, if you prefer, choose a low-fat cheese. This will
let you omit the fat card. Work with these recipes so that they can
work in the best way possible for you.

*Freebie:  Cilantro is know as Coriander in some parts of the
country. It is an acquired taste, so if you don't care for it,
substitute parsley. If you haven't tried it, give it a chance. It
adds a lot of flavor to a dish.

Seafood Sausage

appetizers, main dish, seafood

1/2 lb whitefish, skinned, boned
1/4 lb salmon, skinned and boned
1/4 lb shrimps, peeled
2 tablespoon finely minced onion
1 bunch parsley; stems removed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 cup egg whites
4  feet sausage casings

CUT THE FISH IN 1-INCH PIECES. Place all ingredients except casings
in a food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped. Or, pass all the
ingredients through a meat grinder fitted with medium holes. Stuff the
mixture into sausage casings or form 2 long sausages in plastic wrap.
Poach the sausages in gently simmering water for 5 minutes, drain and
let cool. If you have used plastic wrap to form the sausages, remove
it when sausages are cool. Cut sausages into 6-inch lengths. To
serve, grill the sausages or place under a preheated broiler. Since
the sausages are already cooked, we want only to reheat them and
crisp their skins. Makes 8 Sausages, or 4 Servings

Seafood Stuffed Flounder

cajun, fish, main dish

      ----SEASONING MIX----
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1/2 teaspoon sweet basil
1/2 teaspoon gumbo file (optional)
      ----MAIN INGREDIENTS----
3  slices bacon, diced
1 1/2 cup onions, chopped very fine
1 cup green bell peppers, chopped
1/4 lb + 1 tbsp unsalted butter
3/4 teaspoon white pepper
3/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1/2 lb small shrimp
1 1/2 cup basic seafood stock
6  shucked oysters (med. size)
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup green onions, chopped fine
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
      ----FLOUNDER SEASONING MIX----
2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sweet paprika
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1/4 teaspoon dried sweet basil leaves
6  flounders (see note)
1 1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese
1  vegetable oil for frying

NOTE: Flounder should be 1 to 1-1/4 pounds each, boned, heads removed
and brown side split down the center. Combine the first seasoning mix
ingredients in a small bowl; mix well and set aside. In a large
skillet fry the bacon over high heat until crisp. Add onions, celery
and bell peppers. Stir well and saute until vegetables start to get
tender, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add 3 tablespoons of
the butter and the white and red peppers; stir until butter is
melted. Stir in the shrimp and the first seasoning mix. Continue
cooking for about 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping
pan bottom well. Stir in the stock and the oysters; cook and stir
about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Use a slotted spoon to spoon
the seafood vegetable mixture into a food processor or blender,
leaving the liquid in the skillet; process mixture until smooth,
about 15 to 30 seconds. Return mixture to skillet, stirring to blend
with liquid; turn heat to high, and cook until mixture starts
sticking excessively, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally and
scraping pan bottom well. Remove from heat. Meanwhile, in a 1-quart
saucepan melt the remaining 6 tablespoons butter over high heat; when
almost melted, remove from heat, then add 1/4 cup of the flour and
stir until mixture is smooth. Return to high heat for 1 minute,
stirring constantly. Turn heat to high under the stuffing mixture;
gradually add the butter-flour mixture, stirring constantly until
well blended. If mixture starts "weeping" oil at this point, stir in
about 2 tablespoons more stock or water.) Continue cooking until very
thick, about 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the green
onions and cook 1 minute more, stirring constantly. Remove from heat
and stir in the Parmesan. Cool slightly, then refrigerate until
chilled, about 30 minutes. In a small bowl thoroughly combine the
flounder seasoning mix ingredients. Open the flounders for stuffing.
Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon ofthe seasoning mix on the inside of each
flouner. Mound 1/4 cup of the cheddar cheese in the center of each,
then spoon a scant 1/2 cup chilled stuffing on top of the cheese.
Close the fish so the stuffing doesn't show. Cover and refrigerate
for 1 to 2 hours. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of the seasoning mix on each
side of each chilled flounder, patting it in with your hands. In a
pan (cake and pie pans work well) combine the remaining seasoning mix
with the remaining 1/2 cup flour. In a large, heavy skillet heat 1/4
inch oil over high heat to about 350F. Meanwhile, place each flounder
(split side up) in the seasoned flour to coat only the bottom
surface. Carefully slide each flounder into the hot oil and fry the
bottom until it's crispy, crunchy and brown-brown!-- about 3 to 4
minutes. Without draining, place the flounder, still split side up,
on an ungreased cooke sheet. Bake at 550F until the fish are cooked
and well browned on top, about 10 minutes (after about 4 minutes,
drape a piece of aluminum foil over the tails so they won't burn).
Serve immediately as is, or topped with Hollandaise Sauce, Shrimp and
Crab Buttercream Sauce, or Bearnaise Sauce From Paul Prudhomme's

1 dash cayenne pepper
      ----FILLING----
1 each onions
3 tablespoon butter
1/3 cup parsley, chopped
1/2 cup monterey jack, shredded
1 lb imitation crab legs
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
4 each tortillas

Melt butter in saucepan. Stir in flour, then cook, stirring
constantly, for 1 minute. Gradually stir in milk, then cook, stirring
constantly, until bubbly thick. Stir in Monterey Jack cheese and
cayenne pepper.

Preheat oven to 375. Grease a 9"x13" glass baking dish. Finely chop
onion. Saute onion in butter in skillet. Stir in parsley, cheese, and
just enough white sauce to moisten.  Stir in chopped crab legs and
cayenne pepper. Divide filling among tortillas, then roll up and
arrange seam side down in a dish.  Pour remaining white sauce over.
Cover with foil. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until bubbly hot.

Sylvia's comments: I doubt a Mexican would find anything authentic
about this, but it was sure good! For a potluck, I used 20 small
tortillas instead of 8 large ones. If the filling is still warm when
you put the finished tortillas into the oven, 10-20 minutes is plenty
of time to get it hot.

Seared Salmon

fish, seafood

4  center-cut salmon fillets, skin on,; about 8 oz each
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
      ----FOR THE MARINADE----
1/2 cup white-wine vinegar
1 cup water
1/2 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoon finely chopped garlic
1/2 teaspoon salt

As it sears over high heat, the salmon cooks skin-side down. The skin
will become dark and crisp because the sugar crystallizes, imparting
a great flavor.

1. Combine marinade ingredients in a small saucepan and simmer over
medium heat for 30 minutes. Cool.

2. Place the salmon in the marinade and let rest at room temperature
for 30 minutes.

3. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet for 30 seconds over medium
heat. Remove salmon from marinade and place in hot skillet, skin-side
down. Raise the heat to medium-high and cook for 2-3 minutes, lifting
salmon with a spatula to loosen it from the pan.

4. Reduce heat to medium; cover; cook 3-4 minutes, until fish is just
cooked through. Serve immediately.

Sesame Shrimp Toast

appetizers, chinese, seafood

1/2 lb peeled raw shrimp or prawns
2  egg whites
3 cup oil for deep-frying
3 slice day-old bread
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
1 cup white sesame seeds

These tasty dainties are quick and easy to prepare. They are a popu-
lar snack and banquet dish that takes several forms, depending on
budget and occasion.  The lesser tea houses stretch the shrimp by
adding 1/3 soft-flesh fish.

Preparation:  Peel and devein raw shrimp.  Chop, then mash, shrimp to
soft pulp.  A cleaver or food processor works well for this. Mix
shrimp meat with salt and cornstarch. Remove crust from bread; slice
each into 6 rectangles.  We used heavy wheat bread, which gives a
chewy texture; light white bread would be more crisp and absorb less
oil. Separate eggs; beat whites to stiff peaks.  Fold egg whites
completely into shrimp mixture.

Deep-frying:  Because shrimp mixture is a little runny, wait until
you are ready to deep-fry before spreading mixture on bread. Put
about 1 teaspoon of mixture on each piece of bread. Set them on
plate; sprin- kle with raw white sesame seeds.

Heat oil slowly to medium hot.  Test with crust of bread; it should
brown in 10 seconds.  Deep-fry 6 pieces at a time, shrimp side down,
until they brown; then roll them over to brown the bread. Pieces are
buoyant balls, which may be uncooperative, so keep an eye on them.
Frying time is about 3 minutes.  After frying, remove to warm serving
platter. Serve.

After deep-frying, they keep for about 30 minutes in warm oven.
However, they are best right out of deep-fryer. We suggest you fry a
second batch midway through the buffet; to fry 18 takes about 7
minutes.

Sesame Steaks

seafood

4  8-oz. trout steaks
2 oz whiskey; or brandy
2  cl garlic
2 oz lemon juice
1 tablespoon salt
1/2 cup butter; melted
2 tablespoon soy sauce
1 cup sesame seeds; or more
1  slivers of ginger; (if desir

Grind the garlic very fine or pound it in a mortar with the
tablespoon of salt.  Or, you may crush it and mix it in a bowl with a
heavy wooden spoon. Rub this mixture on the fish and let it stand for
at least 1 hour, 2 or 3 hours will make it much better.

Prepare a basting sauce with the soy sauce (use more than 2
tablespoons if you like the flavor), the whiskey or brandy, the lemon
juice, and melted butter. Paint the fish with this mixture before and
during cooking. Turn once.  Cook until pleasantly browned and then
sprinkle heavily with sesame seeds.  Continue cooking until the seeds
are well toasted. Serve on a hot platter with wedges of lemon or lime.

Slivers of ginger (fresh or preserved) may be added to the basting
sauce if you like the zest they give.

Serves 4.

Seviche Acapulco

appetizers, fish, mexican

1 lb turbot fish, in fillets
1  onion, chopped
2  tomatoes, chopped
1  avocado, chopped
1 cup green olives (small)
6 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoon parsley, chopped
1 cup lime juice
1  serrano chile, chopped
1 tablespoon ketchup
1 tablespoon white wine
2  jalapeno chilies, chopped
2 oz capers

Cut the fish fillets into about 1-inch cubes. Marinate it for at
least 6 hours (preferably overnight) in about 1/2 cup of lime juice.

Rinse the fish in a colander and let it dry for 5 minutes. Put it in a
large bowl along with the rest of the lime juice. Put in the rest of
the ingredients. Add salt, pepper and oregano to taste. Mix. Serve
with salted crackers.

NOTES:

*  A tasty, marinated fish appetizer from Mexico -- This recipe comes
from the Delicias Culinarias cookbook that I brought from Mexico. The
introduction to the recipe reads: "Seviche is prepared with raw
marinated fish.  It is very popular in Ecuador, Peru and in the north
of Chile. Depending on the region in Mexico, there exist several
different styles to prepare it.  This recipe comes from the Acapulco
region".

I am sure that you have tasted this appetizer if you have ever been
to a beach in Mexico. It is usually served right where you are
"roasting" in the sun or swimming. Yes, the fish in this recipe is
raw. However it is "cooked" by marinating it in lime juice.

*  Use fresh lime juice.  You can use any kind of fish that you like
with the condition that it does not fall apart after marinating. For
instance, it does not work with white fish.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes (after marinating the fish).
: Precision:  no need to measure.

* (note: there is no suitable substitute for shark's fin)

This is some serious food++as most of these recipes are. They are the
creations of one of the most intense culinary environments in the
world and the competition is fierce. I've never seen the Bamboo
Fungus called for in this soup in any of the Asian markets I've been
in and preparing a Shark's Fin is not for the impatient.

Establishment: Bui Hang Village Restaurant (Hotel Miramar) UG/F.,
Princess Wing, Hotel Miramar, 130 Nathan Road, Tsimshatsui, Kowloon.

Chinese Cuisine Practical Class Platinum Award - Shark's Fin "Gossamer
curtains veiling exquisite feminine shadows" would be a justifiably
poetical translation for the mood-setting name of this dish. The
bamboo fungus, a deluxe vegetarian ingredient with almost mystical
connotations, is envisaged as a curtain of delicate fibres, through
which the beguilingly beautiful forms of the superlative shark's fin
can be glimpsed. Red Mayflowers (denoted by the crab roe) are
"embroidered" on the curtains, adding a third level of appetizing
connotations.

To prepare 1. Soak, shark's fin for 4 hours in cold water, and then
simmer over medium heat for 10 hours. 2. Clean bamboo fungi and soak
in cold water for 3 to 4 hours. 3. Steam-clean crab claws for
approximately 3 minutes on plate on wok stand above boiling water. 4.
Make shrimp paste by mixing shrimp meat with cornstarch and pinch of
salt.

To cook 1. Mix simmering ingredients with water (sufficient to cover
fin) and bring to the boil.  Add cooled shark's fin and boil for 5
minutes. Dram well and stuff inside bamboo fungi. 2. Arrange stuffed
fungi on a deep plate.  Mix 1 cup of stock and 1/4 tsp of salt and
pour over fungi. Cover and steam for 15 minutes. 3. Coat each claw
with 10 g of shrimp paste, garish with a sprig of coriander, place in
a deep plate, cover and steam for 3 minutes. 4. Add 1 cup oil to
heated wok, then add asparagus and saute for 30 seconds. Drain and
place asparagus in 3 cups of salted water and simmer until just
cooked. Drain and refresh with cold water. 5. Stir-fry bean sprouts
in a heated wok with 1 tbs oil, 1/2 tsp salt and ginger juice until
half-cooked, but still crunchy.  Remove from wok. 6. To make crab roe
sauce, add water, cornstarch and salt to stock. Over a high flame,
bring to the boil. Add crab roe and bring to the boil again (at which
point presentation platter should be ready for this sauce).

To present 1. Arrange stuffed bamboo fungi like spokes of a wheel,
pointing inwards on serving dish.  Lay asparagus and crab claws
between them. 2. Pour freshly boiled crab roe sauce over dish. Pile
bean sprouts in centre, top with shredded ham.

Shellfish Crepes

main dish, sauces, seafood

      ----FILLING----
2 tablespoon butter
3 tablespoon shallots or scallions minced
1  green part included
1 1/2 cup diced or shredded, cooked or
1  canned shellfish meat shrimp
1  or crabmeat are good
1/4 cup dry white vermouth
1  salt and pepper
      ----SAUCE----
1/3 cup dry white vermouth
2 tablespoon cornstarch mixed w/2tb milk
1 1/2 cup heavy cream or half n half
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup swiss cheese, grated
1  dash of nutmeg - optional
      ----ASSEMBLY----
12  crepes 6 to 7in in diameter
1/4 cup swiss cheese grated
2 tablespoon butter
1  creamed shellfish filling
1  wine and cheese sauce

To make the Filling: Heat butter to bubbling, stir in the shallots or
scallions, then the shellfish. Toss and stir for one minute. Season
with salt and pepper; add vermouth and boil rapidly until liquid has
almost evaporated. Set aside.

To make the Sauce:  Heat vermouth and boil rapidly until reduced to a
tablespoon. Remove from heat and stir in cornstarch mixture, cream and
seasonings. Put back on heat and simmer for about 2 minutes stirring
constatntly. Blend in the cheese and stir to blend about a minute
more.

To Assemble:  Blend about half the sauce with the shellfish filling.
Place a big spoonful on the lower third of each crepe and roll up
(you can tuck and roll like you would for blintzes) Arrange crepe
close together in a lightly buttered baking dish. Spoon the rest of
the sauce over the crepes and sprinkle with cheese. Dot with butter;
may be refrigerated until ready to bake. Fifteen to twenty minutes
before serving bake in upper third of a preheated 425F oven until
bubbling hot and cheese has browned lightly.

NOTES:  I have also added mushrooms to the filling but watch the water
content, you may have to pour off some of the liquid before adding
cheese sauce.

I also add a dash or two of nutmeg to the cream sauce and use
slightly more cheese than called for. You could also use Gruyere
cheese.

For individual servings bake them two to a serving in individual
gratin dishes. This dish does not reheat well, unless of course it is
just for you then there's no problem:)

This recipe is from my mom who based it on a recipe of Julia Child a
long time ago. Typos by Kim Reese.

Shellfish Shell Marinara

pasta, seafood

3 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 large garlic sloces, peeled and bruised
2 can plum tomatoes, drained and coarsely; chopped (28 oz)
1/4 cup dry red wine
1/4 cup coarsely chopped parsley
1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, torn in half
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1  salt to taste
1  freshly ground black pepper to tast; e
1 pinch sugar
12 oz medium-sized shell pasta
20  littleneck clams
1/2 lb large shrimp, peeled and deveined

For company or a special family meal, there is nothing quite like
littleneck clams and shrimp quickly cooked up in a robust marinara
sauce. (No cheese is necessary with this sauce; flavoring the oil
with garlic is the secret to its great taste.) The clams will take
longer to open than the shrimp will take to cook, so add the shrimp
at the last moment. Be sure to discard any clams that don't open -
this could mean they are not safe to eat.

1. Place oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-low heat. Add the
garlic and cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until it colors slightly
but does not burn. Remove garlic from heat and carefully stir in the
tomatoes.

2. Return the pot to medium heat. Add the wine, parsley, basil,
oregano, salt, pepper and sugar. Cook sauce slowly, stirring
occasionally, for 30 minutes.

3. Slightly before serving, cook pasta in boiling, salted water for
10-12 minutes or until AL DENTE (just tender).

4. While pasta is cooking, add the clams to the sauce; cover and cook
for 8 minutes or until the clams just begin to open, shaking the pot
once or twice. Add shrimp and cook 5 minutes longer.

5. Divide the cooked pasta among six shallow bowls. Spoon the hot
sauce over the top, distributing the clams and shrimp evenly, and
serve immediately.

Shrimp & Scallop Chowder With Coconut Milk

seafood, soups

2 lb shrimp
1/2  scotch bonnet or other hot chili, s; eeded
4  shallots
2  cloves garlic
3  scallions
1  inch fresh ginger
1  red bell pepper
1  green bell pepper
3 tablespoon butter
2  to 3 tsp curry powder
6 cup fish stock or bottled clam broth
2 cup coconut milk
1  salt and freshly ground black peppe; r
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro for garnish

"This recipe was loosely inspired by a dish at the retaurant Al Forno
in Providence, R.I.  Curry powder, cilantro and scotch bonnet chilies
lend the chowder a West Indian accent. (Scotch bonnet are the world's
hottest chilies -- look for them at Caribbean markets. Or substitute
a milder chili, such as serrano or jalapeno.) Be sure to use
unsweetened coconut milk, which can be found canned in Indian,
Southeast Asian, and Hispanic markets."

Peel and devein the shrimp and cut into 1 inch pieces. Remove the
crescent-shaped muscle on the side of the scallops. Cut large
scallops in quarters, medium size ones in half, so that all are the
same size. Mince the chili, shallots, garlic, scallions and ginger.
Core, seed, and dice the peppers.

Melt the butter in a large saucepan.  Cook the minced and diced
vegetables over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until soft but not
browned. Add the curry powder and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
Add the fish stock and coconut milk and gently simmer for 5 minutes.

Just before serving, add the shrimp and scallops. Gently simmer for 2
to 3 minutes until the shellfish is firm. Correct the seasoning,
adding salt, pepper and curry powder to taste. To serve, ladle the
chowder into bowls and garnish each with chopped cilantro.

Serves 8 to 10.

Shrimp Cantonese (Aka Shrimp In Lobster Sauce

chinese, seafood, shellfish

1 lb shrimp, shelled, tailed, deveined,; rinsed, and towel dried
1  egg white beaten with
1 teaspoon cornstarch
3 tablespoon vegetable oil
8 oz ground pork
4 teaspoon salted black beans
2 tablespoon garlic, minced
1 teaspoon fresh ginger, minced fine
2  scallions, minced
5 teaspoon soy sauce
2 tablespoon dry sherry or rice wine
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 tablespoon cornstarch dissolved in
2 tablespoon cold chicken broth
1  egg beaten with
2 teaspoon sesame oil

Beat egg white with cornstarch. Add shrimp, mix well, and refrigerate
for at least 15 min or up to an hour. Stir-fry in 3 T oil just until
done. Remove to a warming oven with a slotted spoon.

In the same oil (if it's not too yucky) brown the pork. Add next 8
ingredients. Bring to a boil and add cornstarch-water. Return to the
boil and cook until thickened. Remove pan from heat and stir in the
egg; fuss with the mixture so the egg becomes thin filaments rather
than a big glob in the middle of the pan. Stir in the cooked shrimp
and toss with the sauce. Serve immediately.

You may substitute 1 1-1/2# steamed, cut-up lobster for the shrimp to
make Lobster Cantonese (or Lobster in lobster sauce). This will serve
2-3.

Shrimp Creole

cajun, main dish, seafood

2 lb fresh shrimp, heads off
1 quart water
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3 each med. yellow onions, chopped
2 each large bell peppers, chopped
5 each celery ribs, chopped fine
10 each lge. tomatoes, peeled&seeded
2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground red pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 tablespoon fresh thyme or 2 t dried
1 tablespoon fresh basil or 2 t dried
1 1/2 teaspoon sugar
5 each bay leaves
1 cup green onions, chopped
1 cup parsley, chopped

Peel and devein the shrimp.  Place heads (if you have them), and
peels in a small saucepan and add the water. Bring to a slow boil
over medium-high heat and let boil slowly for 15-20 minutes. Strain
and discard the heads and peels.
Place the oil in a Dutch oven or other large, heavy pot and place
over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, peppers, and celery and saute
stirring often, until the vegetables are very soft, about 45 minutes.
Stir in the tomatoes, salt, peppers, herbs, sugar, and shrimp stock
and return to simmer.  Reduce heat to medium and let simmer for 2
hours, stirring occasionally,  This is your creole sauce; it can be
prepared 1 or 2 days in advance and stored in the refrigerator (I
find the sauce is even better after sitting a couple of days in the
refrigerator).
When you are ready to serve, return the sauce to a simmer and add
the shrimp.  Cook until they turn pink, 5-7 minutes. Stir in the
green onions and parsley and let cook for 1 minute more. Serve on
flat plates over beds of rice.
Serves 6-8. SHRIMP AND HAM OR TASSO JAMBALAYA: Prepare Shrimp
Creole as above, but add about a pound of cubed ham and a 4-ounce can
of tomatoe sauce to the finished sauce and simmer 45 minutes more.
Meanwhile, boil or steam 2-3 cups raw rice. Finish the sauce (which

add 8 shrimp (or more if you want) and top with a piece of lemon.
Fold over 2 sides of foil, then ends, so a tight package is formed to

Shrimp In Red Sauce

chinese, seafood

1 lb shrimp; large, uncooked
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon rice wine
1  ginger, fresh, 2 piece
3  scallions
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon peanut oil
1 tablespoon water (or more)
3 tablespoon peanut oil
3 tablespoon ketchup
5 tablespoon water
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt

1. Rinse the shrimps well under running water. Pull off legs, but
leave the shells on.* Using a scissors, cut a small slit about
one-third of the way up the back of the shell. (This will allow the
marinade and cooking sauce to penetrate the shrimps more easily. You
can, if you want, also remove the dark intestine on the back of the
shrimp.)

2. Put the shrimps in a bowl and add 1 teaspoon salt and the rice
wine.

3. Peel the ginger and chop it into small pieces, about the size of a
match head. Add 1 teaspoonful of the chopped ginger to the shrimps in
the bowl and set the rest aside. Stir the shrimps well, then let
stand for at least 30 minutes.

4. Clean the scallions, then chop the white parts into the same size
pieces as the ginger.

5. Mix the cornstarch and 1/4 c water together in a small bowl.

COOKING: 6. Pour off the excess liquid from the shrimps, but don't
rinse them off. (It is all right for the little bits of ginger to
remain on the shrimps.)

7. Heat the pan over a fairly high flame for about 15 seconds, then
add 1 tablespoon peanut oil. The oil will be hot enough to cook with
when the first tiny bubbles form and a few small wisps of smoke
appear.

8. Throw in the shrimps and stir-fry them over high heat for 1 or 2
minutes, until they are nearly cooked, using your cooking shovel or
spoon in a scooping motion to toss the shrimps around in the pan so
they are all exposed to the hot oil. When the shrimps are almost
done, they will begin to turn pink and become slightly stiff. (If
they seem too dry, you can add a little water during the stir-frying
process.)

9. Lower the heat, cover the pan, and let the shrimps cook for 5
minutes more. Then remove them from the pan and set them aside.

10. Clean out the pan by wiping it with a paper towel, then reheat it
over a fairly high flame. Pour in 3 tablespoons fresh peanut oil.
When it is hot enough, quickly add the rest of the chopped ginger,
scallions, and ketchup and stir-fry vigorously for no more than
10    seconds.

11. Immediately add 5 tablespoons water, the sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon
salt and let the mixture come to a boil. Let it cook for about 1
minute, then return the shrimps to the pan.

12. Stir the cornstarch and water thoroughly to make sure they are
well combined, then pour the mixture into the pan. Stirfry the
shrimps and the sauce until the sauce has become clear and thick;
this should not take more than about 30 seconds.

13. Taste the sauce for salt before you serve it, and stir it up a
little on the serving platter just before you bring it to the table.
(This is to make sure that no film has formed on the sauce that would
spoil its bright, fresh appearance.)

14. Serve over rice.

Shrimp On Crab Legs (Cang Cua Boc Tom)

seafood, vietnamese

10  crab legs or several hard shell cra; bs
1  shrimp paste, prepared as for shrim; p on sugar cane
1/4 cup vegetable oil
      ----NUOC CHAM----
1  clove garlic
1/2  fresh hot red chili pepper or 2 dri; ed
2 teaspoon heaping, granulated sugar
1/8  fresh lime
2 tablespoon fish sauce (nuoc mam)
2 1/2 tablespoon water, more if necessary

Here we have a party dish that will bring out "oohs" and "ahs" from
your guests on sight - and a repeat performance on taste.

Crab claws, alone, are sometimes available in fish stores. If they
aren't, boil several hard shell crabs and use the claws; you can use
the bodies in many other dishes.

The crab claws in fish stores are already partially peeled and serve
not only as a handle but are edible as well. If you prepare your own
claws, peel the upper section around which you mold the shrimp paste.

Boil the crab legs or crabs for about 10 minutes, then drain and cool;
remove the claws from the crabs, if using, and reserve the bodies for
another purpose.

Have the shrimp paste ready; preheat the oven to 350F.

Pour the oil into a bowl.  Dip your fingers into the oil and pick up 2
tablespoons of the shrimp paste. Mold it into an oval around and
halfway down the crab claw, covering the part of the claw where it
was attached to the body; this will leave a claw tip extended to
serve as a handle. Place the claws on a baking sheet and bake in the
preheated oven for 30 minutes.

Serve with Nuoc Cham and watercress.

NOTE:  In Vietnam, this dish is always barbecued over charcoal. If
you wish to prepare it this way, cook for 10 minutes on each side.

Makes 10 servings.

NUOC CHAM:

This exciting sauce is almost always served at Vietnamese meals, just
a Westerners serve salt and pepper. It's base is nuoc mam (bottled
fish sauce). Freshly prepared, it is a constant delight, and so
addictive to Western palettes that it will appear with meals other
than Vietnamese. To best appreciate the results of its superb
blending qualities at the table, use it sparingly at first, gradually
adding more until the result is just right for your palate.

Peel the garlic.  Split the chili pepper down the center and remove
the seeds and membrane.  Cut into pieces and put into a mortar,
together with the garlic and sugar. Pound into a paste. Squeeze the
lime juice into the paste, then with a small knife remove the pulp
from the lime section and add it as well. Mash this mixture and add
the fish sauce and water.

NOTE:  If you find this a trifle strong at first, dilute it with an
additional 1/2 tablespoon of water.

Shrimp Risotto

italian, rice, seafood

1 lb shrimp (unshelled)
1  bay leaf
1  celery leaves (a few)
6  peppercorns
1  salt, to taste
1  saffron threads (a few)
3 3/4 cup water
6 tablespoon butter, divided
1  onion, chopped
1  clove garlic, crushed
2 cup italian arborio rice
1 1/4 cup dry white wine
2  zucchini, cut into thin strips
6 oz oyster mushrooms, cut into pieces
2 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese, divided

Rinse and peel the shrimp; set aside.  Rinse the shrimp shells, then
put them in a saucepan along with the bay leaf, celery leaves,
peppercorns, salt, saffron, and water. Bring to a boil, then simmer
for 20 minutes. Strain and reserve the stock.

In a heavy large saucepan or skillet, melt 3 tablespoons of the
butter; add the onion and garlic. Cook for about 5 minutes or until
softened but not colored.  Add the rice and stir to coat all the
grains with butter. Add 1/3 of the reserved stock and bring to a
boil, then simmer, uncovered, until the stock is absorbed. Stirring,
gradually add more stock and the wine until it has all been absorbed
and the rice is cooked; this will take about 20 minutes.

In a separate pan, melt the remaining butter, add the shrimp,
zucchini, and mushrooms; cook for 3 or 4 minutes. Fold the mixture
into the rice along with the rice and half of the cheese. Taste and
add salt, if needed.

Serve piping hot, sprinkled with the remaining cheese.

Makes 4 servings.

1 large head boston, bibb or leaf lettuce,; leaves separated
1  and trimmed
1/2  fresh pineapple, peeled, eyes remov; ed, halved, cored

Servings: 4 as main course, or 8 as an appetizer Notes: This is a

rice papers and simply wrap the filling in lettuce leaves. The rolls
can be assembled ahead of time and served as an appetizer. Or the
wrappers can be placed on the table (with bowls of warm water for
softening) with a platter of fillings, so that guests can make a meal
of them. One half fresh pineapple, peeled, eyes removed, halved,
cored and thinly sliced, 2 tomatoes, thinly sliced, 1/2 cup fresh
cilantro leaves, coarsely chopped, 1/2 cup fresh mint leaves,
coarsely chopped Nuoc Cham dipping sauce, with carrot shreds
DIRECTIONS: Cook shrimp in salted, boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes,
or until pink and firm to the touch. Drain and cool. Peel and devein
shrimp, or serve them in their shells and let diners peel them at the
table. Blanch bean sprouts in boiling water for 1 minute. Drain and
refresh with cold water.

To assemble: Moisten rice papers in warm water for 10 to 20 seconds,
or until softened. Place a lettuce leaf inside each piece of softened
rice paper. Fill with a few shrimp, a little pineapple, bean sprouts,
tomato, cilantro and/or mint. Roll up the bundles and serve with Nuoc
Cham.

1/2 lb rock shrimp or small
      ----GARNISH----
1  prawns shelled & uncooked
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary or 2t fresh

In a food processor bowl equipped with steel blade, puree to a

Shrimp Sauce Piquant

cajun, fish, sauces

2 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 1/4 cup chopped onions
1 1/2 cup chopped green bell peppers
3/4 cup chopped celery
3 cup peeled & chopped tomatoes
1 cup canned tomato sauce
3 tablespoon minced jalapeno (see note)
2  bay leaves
5 1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1 1/2 teaspoon white pepper
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
2 1/4 cup basic seafood stock
1 1/2 teaspoon dark brown sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 lb peeled large shrimp
4 cup hot basic cooked rice

NOTE:  Fresh jalapenos are preferred; if you have to use pickled ones,
rinse as much vinegar from them as possible. Melt the butter in a
4-quart saucepan over high heat. Add the onions, bell peppers and
celery; saute about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the
tomatoes, tomato sauce, jalapenos, bay leaves, ground peppers and
garlic; stir well. Continue cooking about 3 minutes, stirring often
and scraping the pan bottom well. Stir in the stock, sugar and salt
and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors are
married, about 20 minutes, stirring often and scraping pan bottom as
needed.  (If mixture scorches, quit stirring and pour mixture into a
clean pot, leaving the scorched ingredients in the first pan.) Add
the shrimp to the hot (or reheated) sauce and stir. Turn heat up to
high, cover pan, and bring mixture to a boil. Remove from heat. Let
sit covered for 10 minutes. (Meanwhile, heat the serving plates in a
250F oven.)  Stir, remove bay leaves, and serve immediately. To
serve, mound 1/2 cup rice in the center of each heated serving plate;
then pour about 1/2 cup sauce around the rice and arrange about 8
shrimp on top of the sauce. LAGNIAPPE:  "Piquant" to a Cajun means
"it's hot and 'hurts like a sticker in your tongue.'" If you want
less "piquant," reduce the jalapeno peppers by half.  Sauce Piquant
is enjoyed with such gusto in Louisiana that the town of Raceland has
a Sauce Piquant Festival every year dedicated to nothing but fish,
meat, fowl and seafood made with variations of this sauce. From Paul
Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen

appetizers, fish, main dish, microwave

1 lb fresh jumbo shrimp
1/2 cup butter or margarine
2 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoon dried parsley flakes
1  to 2 cloves garlic, peeled and crus; hed
1/2 teaspoon salt
1  paprika (optional)

1. Under cold running water, remove the shells from the shrimp,
leaving last tail section attached. Using a sharp, thin-bladed knife
make a shallow cut lengthwise down the back of each shrimp and wash
out the sand vein. If desired, the shrimp may be butterflied (cut
lengthwise down the back of each shrimp, cutting almost completely
through the shrimp, removing sand vein). 2. In a shallow, 2-quart,
heat-resistant, non-metallic baking dish place butter, lemon juice,
parsley flakes, garlic to taste and salt. 3. Heat, uncovered, in
Microwave Oven 2 minutes. 4. Add shrimp and stir to coat well. If
desired, sprinkle with paprika. 5. Heat, uncovered, in Microwave Oven
6 minutes. Stir shrimp occasionally. Cook just until shrimp are pink
and tender. Do not overcook shrimp as they will become tough.
Variation: If desired, lobster, scallops, crabmeat or any combination
of these may be substituted for shrimp.

Shrimp Scampi In Mushroom Cap

appetizers

1/2 lb butter; softened
6 cup garlic; peeled & chopped s
2 tablespoon parsley; freshly chopped
50  shrimp; tiny

Mix butter, garlic & parsley together. Season w/salt & pepper to
taste. Buy mushroom caps that are all about the size of a half
dollar. Wash, remove stems & set stems aside for another use. This
recipe will fill about 50 mushroom caps.

Put butter mixture into a pastry bag with a star tip. Buy 1 tiny
shrimp for each cap or cut a larger one in half. Peel & devein shrimp
and insert it (either the half or the whole shrimp) in the mushroom
cap. Pipe a small rosette of the butter into---> each mushroom cap.
If there is any butter left, just squeeze it onto the cookie sheet
you will be baking these on.

Bake in a preheated, 400 degree oven for 15-20 minutes or until the
shrimp is pink and butter is all melted. Serve these on a slice of
French or Italian bread (to soak up that butter!) BE SURE YOU MAKE
ENOUGH OF THESE--THEY ARE FABULOUS!

attractively on large tray or platter. Heat oil in deep kettle to
350F. Beat batter. Dip shrimp into all-purpose flour, then into
chilled batter, shaking to remove excess batter. Slip into deep fat

surface of oil, dollop a bit more batter on top of each shrimp and
cook until batter is crisp and slightly golden. Turn once and remove
with slotted spoon or fork and drain on wire rack. Keep hot. Dip
vegetables in flour and batter and cook in same manner. Continue to
cook and drain shrimp and vegetables, a few at a time, adjusting heat
during cooking to maintain 350 degree temperature. Keep batter cool.

Shrimp With Lobster Sauce #1

chinese, seafood

16  raw shrimp, 3-inch unshelled
2 tablespoon oil for stir-fry
1  lobster sauce:
2 teaspoon salted black beans
1 large clove garlic, minced
2  green onions
1 large egg
1 tablespoon water
2 tablespoon cooking oil
1/2 lb ground pork (not sausage)
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/2 tablespoon thin soy sauce
1 teaspoon sugar
1  cornstarch paste

Contrary to popular belief, lobster sauce does not contain lobster.
It's delicious served OVER lobster or shrimp.

Lobster Sauce:  Soak salted black beans for 10 minutes; rinse &
drain. Mash with garlic. Cut green onions in 1/2" sections. In small
bowl, beat egg with water.

Shrimp: Shell, devein & butterfly shrimp. To butterfly shrimp, slice
along the back about 3/4 of the way through the flesh with a small
paring knife. Spread shrimp open; cover but do not refrigerate.

To stir-fry, heat wok to medium-high.  When hot, dribble oil around
side of pan.  Put shrimp in wok all at once, & start tossing. Keep
shrimp in motion, so they will cook uniformly. When they just begin
to curl, remove to the serving dish.

Heat wok to medium; add remaining oil.  When oil is hot (not smoking)
add garlic/bean mixture.  Stir briskly until aroma of beans & garlic
is strong, but don't overcook. Add ground pork in little pieces;
stir-fry until cooked, about 4 minutes.  Add broth, soy sauce &
sugar, stirring while mixture comes to a boil. Thicken mixture with
corn- starch paste to create a light cream-like sauce (not too
thick). Slowly stir in beaten egg. Cook briefly.  Add shrimp. Mix and
serve.

Shrimply Delicious *** Ellie

appetizers, party, seafood

1 lb large shrimp; (26-30)
1 cup chili sauce
15 each sl bacon; cut in half

Shell and devein shrimp. Marinate raw shrimp in chili sauce for 1
hour, or over- night.  Wrap  each shrimp in 1/2 piece of bacon and
secure with a toothpick  (I soak the toothpicks in water so they
don't burn).
Preheat oven to  broil  and place shrimp 6-7 inches from heat and
cook for approximately 3-4 minutes or un- til bacon is browned. Turn
over and brown other side. Serve hot. Even though you have to cook
these at the last minute,  the assembly can be done the day before.

Shrimps Pacifica

main dish, seafood

1 lb large raw shrimp in shell
1/2 cup peanut oil or salad oil
1/2 cup lemon juice
1 teaspoon italian seasoning
1 teaspoon seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon seasoned pepper
2 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1/4 cup green onions, thinly sliced

Wash shrimps under cold running water; remove feelers but do not
shell; drain on paper toweling.  Place in medium size bowl. Stir
peanut oil or salad oil, lemon juice, Italian seasoning, and seasoned
salt and pepper together.  Pour over shrimp and let stand for about
30 minutes -- stirring frequently.  I prefer to let them stay in the
marinade overnight in the frig. Lift shrimp from the marinade about
1/2 hour before barbecuing and let them drain. Place on grill about 6
inches from hot coals. Brush with marinade.  Grill, turning once and
brushing with marinade. Takes about 6 minutes per side or until pink.
Pour remaining marinade into a small saucepan, stir in brown sugar
and soy sauce. Heat to boiling, then stir in green onions. Serve
separately as a dip for shrimp. Have plenty of napkins or damp
washcloths.  I use shrimp that is 12-16 per lb. I figure about 4 per
person -- but sometimes for big eaters 6 per person. I then make an
extra half of recipe of the marinade.

Shrimps Peppino

fish, herbs, main dish, vegetables

2 cup large, homemade croutons
1 lb large shrimp (abt. 24) - shelled an; d deveined
1 tablespoon flour
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 cup unsalted butter
2  garlic cloves - peeled and quartere; d
1/3 cup dry white wine
2 medium tomatoes; peeled - seeded, coarsely
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
1  salt and pepper; to taste

Cut thick slices (about 4) of French bread into quarters. Drizzle
with some olive oil.  Bake in a hot oven until golden brown, turning
several times. Can be made in advance and kept in a sealed container
for several days. These will be your croutons.

To cook tableside, choose a large chafing dish or skillet that sits
securely over a flame.

Prepare ingredients ahead of time and place in individual bowls.
Lightly sprinkle shrimp with flour. Heat oil and butter in skillet
until bubbling. Add quartered garlic cloves and cook, stirring, over
medium heat for several minutes, to infuse butter with garlic
essence. Remove garlic.

Add shrimp and cook briefly on one side - just until they turn pink.
With tongs, quickly turn and cook other side. Add white wine,
tomatoes, herbs, salt and pepper. Cook 2 minutes longer, stirring
frequently.

Place croutons in and around the shrimp.  Turn to let both sides of
croutons absorb some of the butter-garlic juices. Serve at once,
giving each person several shrimp and croutons, then spooning over
some of the tomatoes and sauce.
