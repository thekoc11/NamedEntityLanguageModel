      2 ts Butter
           -salt and pepper to taste
      3    Apples-unpeeled with cores
      1 ts Sugar
           Cinnamon

  Cook the chops using melted fat trimmed from the meat and 1 tsp butter.
  (Note those concerned about their fat intake may chose to use corn oil or
  some other vegetable oil rather than the pork fat). Season to taste and set
  on hot platter. Keep warm. Slice the apples 1/2" thick and add to the pan
  with 1 tsp butter, the sugar and a few pinches of cinnamon or cloves. Cook
  over medium heat for about 10 minutes, turning once or twice until some of
  apples are browned. Arrange them around the chops and serve. Serves: 4-6

  To quote Mme. Benoit, "The apples keep the chops moist and tender. I
  sometimes use 6 to 7 apples, then I use 1 Tablespoon sugar. Serve very
  hot."

 Categories: Canadian, Meats, Baird
   Servings:  1

      1    Peameal Bacon, 1 centre cut
           -piece

  "Peameal bacon is a unique Canadian meat, pickled but unsmoked loin of pork
  rolled in cornmeal. Usually it is sliced and fried for breakfast but it
  excellent baked whole. The cornmeal makes a crisp exterior and the meat,
  although quite lean, is particularly juicy, because of the pickling
  process. For baking it is important to select a piece from the centre cut,
  with a wide band of lean visible on both ends."

  Place in an open roasting pan, fat side up. Bake at 350F degrees for 1-
  1/2 hours. Serve hot in generous slices with baked beans if desired.

      Title: Bannock
 Categories: Canadian, Breads
   Servings:  6

      1 c  Whole wheat flour
    1/2 c  All purpose flour
    1/2 c  Rolled oats
      2 tb Sugar, granulated
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts -Salt
      2 tb Butter, melted
    1/3 c  Raisins; optional
    3/4 c  -Water; approx,

  "Bannock, a simple type of scone was cooked in pioneer days over open
  fires. Variations in flours and the additional of dried or fresh fruit make
  this bread the simple choice of Canadian campers even today.  Oven baking
  has become an acceptable alternative to the cast iron frypan. McKelvie's
  restaurant in Halifax serves an oatmeal version similar to this one. For
  plain bannock, omit rolled oats and increase the all purpose flour to 1
  cup....
  One of the earliest quick breads, bannock was as simple as flour, salt, a
  bit of fat (often bacon grease) and water. In gold rush days, dough was
  mixed right in the prospector's flour bag and cooked in a frypan over an
  open fire.
   Indians wrapped a similar dough around sticks driven into the ground
  beside their camp fire, baking it along with freshly caught fish. Today's
  native _Fried Bread_ is like bannock and cooked in a skillet.
     Newfoundlander's _Damper Dogs_ are small rounds of dough cooked on the
  stove's dampers while _Toutons_ are similar bits of dough deep fried. At a
  promotional luncheon for the 1992 Inuit Circumpolar Conference, Eskimo
  Doughnuts, deep fried rings of bannock dough, were served. It is said that
  Inuit children prefer these "doughnuts" to sweet cookies.
     Red River settlers from Scotland made a frugal bannock with lots of
  flour, little sugar and drippings or lard. Now this same bread plays a
  prominent part in Winnipeg's own Folklorama Festival.
     At Expo '86 in Vancouver, buffalo on bannock buns was a popular item at
  the North West Territories ' restaurant. In many regions of Canada, whole
  wheat flour or wheat germ replaces part of the flour and cranberries or
  blueberries are sometimes added. A Saskatchewan firm markets a bannock
  mix, and recipe books from coast to coast upgrade bannock with butter,
  oatmeal, raisins, cornmeal and dried fruit."

  Stir together flours, oats, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add melted
  butter, raisins (if using) and water, adding more water if needed to make
  sticky dough. With floured hands, pat into greased pie plate. Bake in 400F
  oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until browned and tester comes out clean. Cut
  into wedges.
  SERVES:6
  VARIATIONS: In place of raisins add chopped dried apricots or fresh
  berries.(Blueberries are terrific if one is camping in northern Ontario in
  August.)

 Categories: French can, Acadian, Meats
   Servings:  1

      2 c  Pork blood
           -Salt
      2 lb Pork, fresh
      1    Pig's lung
    1/2    Pig's heart

           -to taste
      2 tb Flour

  "Blood pudding is one of the great delicacies of Acadian cuisine. It used
   to be that every Acadian family made its own. Since the annual slaughter
   came during Advent, the boudin was usually saved for the Christmas
   holidays." Also part of Cajun cuisine,

  Sauce a boudin
  When slaughtering a pig, collect the fresh blood, immediately add salt and
  stir to prevent coagulation.
  Cut the fresh pork, the lung, heart and neck into large pieces. Place the
  meat into a large pot and add just water to cover the meat. Add the salt
  and 3 chopped onions. Simmer on medium heat for 3 hours.
  Remove the meat from the cooking liquid and let it cool. Cut the meat into
  very small pieces or grind it with a meat grinder. Add the meat to the
  cooking liquid with the 2 remaining onions, pepper and spices.
  Bring the liquid to a boil and slowly add the blood by pouring it through
  a sieve. Stir constantly. Add the flour, mixed with a small amounts of
  water. (The flour may be browned in the oven before being add to the meat,
  provided that slightly more flour is used.) Simmer the mixture on low heat
  for approximately 1 hour, stirring frequently.
  This sauce may served later by warming in a skillet.

  Boudin des Branches (Blood Pudding Sausages)
  To make blood pudding sausages, prepare blood pudding sauce but do not
  simmer for the last half hour. Rather, clean the small intestines of the
  pig, cut them into 20 inch pieces at tie them at one end.
  Using a funnel or a piece of birch bark as was the Acadian tradition, fill
  the intestinal lining with the sauce until the intestine is three
  quarters full. press out the air and tie the other end, leaving some space
  for expansion.
  Put the branches (sausages) in boiling water and cook for 45 to 1 hour.

    1/4 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Brown sugar; packed

    1/2 c  Corn syrup
    1/2 c  Raisins; or currants
     12    Tart shells;lined with
           -pastry shells

  "These tarts were the basis for Butter Tart Pie and Butter Tart Squares
  which appeared in later decades. Another variation uses maple syrup
  instead of corn syrup. ...Butter Tarts are uniquely Canadian. There are
  theories whether they were adapted from southern pecan pie, old-fashioned
  sugar pies, or maple syrup, backwoods or vinegar pies. Squabbles arise
  whether or not the tarts should be runny or not, and just how runny.
  Opinions differ about the use of syrup or sugar only, eggs beaten or not,
  currants or raisins, and how the tart pans should be filled."

    In bowl, cream together butter, sugar and vanilla. Beat in egg and corn
  syrup. Spoon raisins into tart shells; pour in the filling, two-thirds
  full. Bake in 375F oven for 15 to 18 minutes or until lightly browned.

      Title: Cape Breton Oatcakes
 Categories: Canadian, Scottish, Breads
   Servings:  1

      2 c  Flour;all purpose
      2 c  Rolled oats
      1 c  Brown sugar;packed
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts -Salt
      1 c  Shortening
    1/2 c  -Cold water

------------------------------SAVORY VARIATION------------------------------
      2 c  Oatmeal; scotch type*
      1 c  Flour;all purpose
      2 ts Sugar, granulated
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts -Salt
    1/3 c  Shortening; or lard or
           -bacon fat
    1/4 c  -Cold water

  Anne's note: I prefer the savory version as it is closer to the original
  Scottish version ; my grandmother in Nova Scotia uses 'pinhead' oatmeal, a
  fine grind of oatmeal sold in the Maritimes, "Ogilivy's" is the most
  popular brand there. Processing the oats in a food processor for a few
  seconds should help.

  "If desired process the oats in a food processor for 10 seconds to get a
  finer texture...The original recipe for oatcakes likely arrived with
  Scottish settlers in Nova Scotia. Fine oatmeal ground in the pioneer's
  gristmills, a little fat worked with fingertips, and perhaps a touch of
  sugar, made a crispy baked "cake" to eat with cheese or jam. Over the
  years, Cape Bretoners (and eventually all cooks across Canada) used rolled
  oats and more sugar to make a cookie-like oatcake. The Glenghorm Resort in
  Angonish, Nova Scotia, prints a recipe for these regional favorites on its
  postcards. Trilibys, a British version, richer and filled with a cooked
  date mixture, lead to the Date Sandwich Cookies so popular in Canada over
  the years."

  Sweet version: Stir together flour, oats, sugar, baking powder and salt;
  rub in shortening with fingertips. Mix in water with fork, until ball
  forms; divide in half.
    On a floured surface, roll out each half to 1/4 inch (5 mm) thickness.
  Cut into 2 1/2 inch (6 squares), then into triangles. Bake on lightly
  greased baking sheets in 350F oven for 15 minutes or till lightly browned.
  Transfer to racks to cool.
  MAKES: 60

  Savory Variation: (to serve with cheese)
  Mix 2 cups Scotch-type oatmeal, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 2 tsp each
  granulated sugar and baking powder, and 1/4 tsp salt. Work in 1/3 cup
  shortening, lard or bacon fat. Add 1/4 cup cold water. Proceed as above.

  Souffle de Chou-Fleur
   The fertile plains around Lac St. Jean produces excellent vegetables and
  supports thriving dairy farms. A strong cheddar cheese, made at St. Prime

  mash. Melt butter in medium saucepan, blend in flour and cook, stirring
  over medium heat until bubbly; do not let mixture brown.

   In this recipe Quebec snow crab is combined with brocolli, oven-poached
  and served on a sauce, nouveau cuisine fashion. This appetizer is the
  creation of Chef Denis Pelletier of Moulin de St. Laurent, a contemporary
  French restaurant located in an old stone mill in the village of St.
  Laurent on Ile d'Orleans. Ramekins can be filled ahead and oven poached at
  the last minute, or you can reheat the cooked flan in a microwave oven for
  about 2 minutes at Medium (50 percent).

    Cook brocolli florets in boiling salted water just until tender-crisp;
  drain. Generously brush 6 to 8 ramekin or custard cups with melted butter.
    Divide crab meat with brocolli among the ramekins. In a bowl, whisk
  together the eggs, cream and milk; season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.
  Fill ramekins three-quarters full with the custard and set in a shallow
  pan of hot water. Oven poach for 1 hour at 325F or until set. (A knife
  inserted in centre should come out clean.)
    Make Lemon Butter Sauce and pour onto 6 to 8 serving plates. Run a knife
  around the edge of each ramekin and unmold onto sauce.

  Lemon Butter Sauce:
    In small saucepan, heat wine and chopped shallot. Bring to a boil and
  reduce over medium-high heat until only 2 tablespoons of liquid remain.
  Reduce heat to low and whisk in butter, a few pieces at a time, until
  sauce is smooth and all the butter is incorporated. Whisk in cream and
  lemon juice. Keep warm in the top of a double boiler set over hot water
  until serving time.

      Title: Crepes a la Neige (Crepes with Snow)
 Categories: French can, Acadian, Desserts
   Servings:  1

      1 c  Flour
  1 1/4 c  Milk
      1 c  Snow, fresh, hard packed
    1/2 ts -Salt
      1 c  Oil

  "Throughout Acadia, it was customary to make crepes at Candlemas and
  objects such as medals, wedding rings, buttons or pennies were hidden
  inside and often used to predict the future of those who found them.
  Moreover, since eggs were often scarce this time of year as a substitute
  with spectacular results. Hence some Acadians still describe a snowfall as
  "being enough to make crepes with." This recipe is always called Crepes a
  la neige, even when eggs are used instead of snow."

  Mix all the ingredients together to make a smooth dough. Drop a spoonful
  of the batter into 1 inch of hot fat. Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side.
  Serve with molasses or grated maple sugar.

      2    Hardbread or hardtack cakes
      1 c  Salt pork; diced

  "Fish and brewis (pronounced "brews") is one of the oldest traditional
  dishes of Newfoundland. ... The fish in Fish and Brewis is salt cod and
  the brewis is made from hardtack or hardbread, which is available
  everywhere in Newfoundland and in specialized grocery stores across
  Canada. The dish is always sprinkled with scrunchions, crisp fried bits of
  salt pork. Fisherman's Brewis is sometimes the same as Fish and Brewis,
  but often the fish and bread are chopped while hot and mixed together, or
  fresh cod is used instead of salt cod."

  Cut cod into serving-size pieces. Soak cod and hardbread separately in
  cold water for 8 hours or overnight. Drain fish. In saucepan, cover fish
  with cold water. Heat to boiling and boil gently for 15 to 20 minutes or
  until tender; drain.
    Meanwhile, in skillet, fry salt pork until golden. Brain bread and place
  in saucepan, cover with salted water and bring to a full boil. Drain
  immediately and serve with fish on warm plates. Sprinkle with scrunchions.

      1 lb Dried peas

    1/4 c  Parsley; fresh,chopped
      1    Bay leaf;small
      1 ts Savory, dried
           -Salt and Pepper

  "Newfoundland Pea Soup is very similar, but usually includes more
  vegetables such as diced turnips and carrots, and is often topped with
  small dumplings. This soup is very good reheated..
  The most authentic version of Quebec's soupe aux pois use whole yellow
  peas, with salt pork and herbs for flavour. After cooking, the pork is
  usually chopped and returned to the soup, or sometimes removed to slice
  thinly and served separately. Instead of fresh or dried herbs, herbes
  salees (herbs preserved with salt) are often used; they are available
  commercially or made at home.
    Pea soup remains a popular dish in restaurants where tourists enjoy a
  true taste of old Quebec. In some variations, a little garlic, leeks,
  other vegetables or a ham bone are added for flavour. For a thicker
  consistency (though this is not traditional) a cup or two of cooked peas
  can be pureed then returned to the soup."

  Wash and sort peas; soak in cold water overnight. Drain and place in a
  large pot; add water, parsley, salt pork, onion, celery, carrots, parsley,
  bay leaf, savory and 1 tsp salt. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer
  until peas are very tender, about 2 hours, adding more water if needed.
  Remove salt pork; chop and return to soup. Discard bay leaf. Season to
  taste with salt and pepper.

           -recipes given
      1 c  Flour
    1/2 ts -Salt
    1/2 c  -Cold water


  "If there was one dish that could be called typically Acadian, it would
  certainly be Fricot, a soup containing potatoes and meat. The dish has
  been a long time favorite in Acadian households, so much  that the word
  fricot was once synomous with a good meal and a common call for dinner was
  often, "Vous etes invites au fricot!"... This potato fricot was prepared
  when neither meat nor fish were available, and given the tongue-in-cheek
  name, "Weasel Fricot" (Fricot a la Belette). If you ask Acadians about the
  origin of the name, they will smile and say, "Parce que b'lette a passe
  tout drouete (Because the weasel went right on by.)

  On Prince Edward it is called Fricot a la bezette (Ninicompoop Fricot)
  where bezette roughly translates as "nincompoop". It is known as butter
  fricot, salted her fricot and potato fricot, and is often served with a
  large slice of buttered bread and molasses."

  Handkerchief Dumplings (Pates en Mouchior de Poche)
  Mix flour with salt. Gradually add cold water to the dough as one would
  when making biscuits.
  Roll the dough fairly thin, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares and place the
  squares in the fricot. Cover and simmer 7 minutes.

  Saute the onion and salted herbs in butter for 1-2 minutes or until the
  onion is golden brown. Add the water, potatoes, salt and pepper, and
  simmer for 20 minutes. To thicken the broth, add dumpling or flour mixed
  with water.

  Gateaux Jos. Louis

  Home-made versions of this best selling commercial snacking cake turn up
  in recipe collections throughout the Beauce. A product of the giant Vachon
  bakery at St. Marie, it was launched by founder-bakers Arcade and
  Rose-Anna Vachon who named it for their eldest two sons Joseph and Louis
  and not, as some believe , after the heavyweight boxing champion, Joe
  Louis. Home recipes use a drop-cookie method and -sometimes- a marshmallow
  filling. The baking cake is made  automatically with a diameter of 3 1/2
  inches (9 cm). To achieve a symmetrical look and a light texture, I
  adapted a recipe belonging to Mariette Scully Bourque of Notre Dame des
  Pins to the muffin tin.

  CAKE: Grease 12 medium muffin tins or 24 small ones. In a large bowl,
  cream butter and sugar together until fluffy. Measure milk into a 1 cup
  measure and stir in vinegar, then baking soda. In another bowl, sift or
  mix together flour, baking powder, cocoa powder and salt. Combine dry
  ingredients with butter mixture with milk; stir in vanilla. Fill prepared
  muffin tins half full of batter. Bake in a preheated 350F oven for about
  10 minutes or until a tester inserted in centre comes out clean. Cool for
  10 minutes in pan. Turn out onto rack and cool completely.

  VANILLA FILLING:
  In top of a double boiler, set over boiling water, combine egg whites,
  granulated sugar, salt and water. With an electric mixer, beat until stiff
  and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and beat in vanilla.

  CHOCOLATE ICING:
  Cream soft butter with cocoa powder. Blend in cream and vanilla. Stir in
  sifted icing (confectioner's) sugar until icing is of spreading
  consistency.

  Slice cakes in half horizontally. Fill with Vanilla Filling and spread
  tops and sides with Chocolate Icing.

      2 tb Butter
    1/4 ts Baking soda
      1 pn -Salt

  Tire a la Melasse de Grand-Mere

  Quebec's sweet tooth is often satisfied by this old-fashioned candy made
  from molasses and sugar. This recipe belongs to Marguerite Legault, a
  member of Les Fermieres de Thuroso, a rural woman's group in the town on
  the Ottawa River.

   In a medium, heavy saucepan, combine molasses, granulated and brown
  sugars and water. Heat to boiling and stir to dissolve sugars. Let mixture
  boil, without stirring, until syrup reaches the hard ball stage
  (260F/125C) on a candy thermometer. Remove from heat, stir in butter,
  baking soda, and salt. Immediately pour onto a buttered marble slab or
  baking sheet.
    When cool enough to handle, butter hands and gather taffy into a ball.
  Pull taffy between hands and continually stretch and fold again until
  taffy turned lighter in colour (this can take from 5 to 15 minutes.)
    Stretch and twist taffy into a rope about 1 inch thick and cut into
  pieces using buttered scissors. Wrap each piece in waxed paper.

      Title: Jellied Moose Nose
 Categories: Meats, Game, Canadian
   Servings:  1

      1    Upper jawbone of a moose
      1    Onion; sliced
      1    Garlic clove
      1 tb Mixed pickling spice
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper
    1/4 c  Vinegar

  1.  Cut the upper jaw bone of the moose just below the eyes.

  2.  Place in a large kettle of scalding water and boil for 45 minutes.

  3.  Remove and chill in cold water.

  4.  Pull out all the hairs - these will have been loosened by the boiling
      and should come out easily ( like plucking a duck).

  5.  Wash thoroughly until no hairs remain.

  6.  Place the nose in a kettle and cover with fresh water.

  7.  Add onion, garlic, spices and vinegar

  8.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the meat is tender.
      Let cool overnight in the liquid.

  9.  When cool, take the meat out of the broth, and remove and discard the
      bones and the cartilage.  You will have two kinds of meat, white meat
      from the bulb of the nose, and thin strips of dark meat from along the
      bones and jowls.

  10. Slice the meat thinly and alternate layers of white and dark meat in a
      loaf pan.

  11. Reheat the broth to boiling, then pour the broth over the meat in the
      loaf pan.

  12. Let cool until jelly has set.  Slice and serve cold.

  I must confess I have not yet tried this recipe, mainly for lack of a
  moose nose...   But, sometime, maybe...

  pickled beets.

  Hot Biscuits: Sift together in bowl, flour, baking powder (no error in
  amount) and salt. Mix together cream with 2 beaten eggs. Add to flour and
  mix just enough to moisten; the dough is rather soft and should remain
  lumpy. Stir as little as possible. Drop by spoonfuls on a greased cookie
  sheet. Cook 16 minutes at 400F.

  from Mme. Benoit, "In days that followed Christmas, every bit of the turkey
  was used - the bones for soup, the skin, diced and crisped in the oven til
  browned, then served, instead of butter, on toasted homemade bread. So,
  when it came time to make hash from all the little bits and pieces, the
  children felt that the poor turkey must be tired (fatiguee), hence the
  name.

  Tarte au sirop d'erable
  "This classic sweet of old Quebec has a smooth, rich filling, typically
  shallow and very sweet. Variations of the traditional recipes are still
  popular in Quebec. ... Syrup, sugar or molasses pies of all kinds were
  popular in every region in pioneer days. In Quebec Maple Syrup Pie (Tarte
  au sirop d'erable) and Sugar Pie (tarte au sucre) made use of local maple
  syrup and maple sugar when available, or brown sugar for economy.
   Backwoods Pie , using brown sugar plus maple or corn syrup, appears in
  early Nova Scotia cookbooks as well as national books such as the Five
  Roses Cookbook (1915) Molasses Pie (tarte a la ferlouche or tarte a la
  molasses in Quebec) and Lassy Tart (in Newfoundland) was usually lightly
  spiced and thickened with bread crumbs. Shoofly Pie, most common in
  Mennonite areas, had molasses and brown sugar filling with crumbs on top.
  In the early years, when ingredients were scare, molasses was a standby
  everywhere.)

  Whisk water with flour until smooth; stir into syrup in small heavy
  saucepan. Stir in egg; cook over medium -low heat, stirring, until thick,
  about 7 minutes. Stir in butter until melted. Pour into pie shell. Let

      2 c  Dates; chopped, pitted
    1/2 c  Sugar, granulated
      1 ts Lemon juice
    3/4 c  -Boiling water

  "This recipe in some old cookbooks is called Date Sandwich Cake. Other
  variations are Raisin Squares or Fig Squares. ..
  Date Squares (Matrimonial Cake, if you happen to come from the West) are a
  real nostalgia treat. The fillings in the 30s recipes was extremely sweet.
  Today's versions reduce the sugar in the filling, since the dates are
  sweet enough, and are often microwaved. Raisin Puff, an old favorite in
  P.E.I. is somewhat similar, with raisin filling sandwiched between layers
  of soft cookie dough instead of an oatmeal mixture."

  Filling: In saucepan, cook dates, sugar, lemon juice and water over medium
  heat, stirring often, until the dates are soft, about 15 minutes. Let
  cool.
    In a bowl, combine flour, rolled oats, sugar, baking soda and salt;
  blend in butter until mixture is crumbly. Pat half onto bottom of 9 inch
  square pan. Spread filling evenly over the top. Sprinkle with the
  remaining flour mixture, patting lightly. Bake in a 350F oven for 30 to 35
  minutes or until nicely browned. Let cool; cut into squares.

  MAKES: 36 SQUARES
  VARIATION: Mincemeat Squares : Use 2 cups mincemeat instead of date
  filling.

  Rodier, March 1993

  From Blue Ribbon Cook Book, Winnipeg Manitoba 1905 - Mince Pie Hints Dried
  apples soaked in water a few hours make a very fair substitute for fresh
  apples in mince pies.  Dried cherries and other fruit prepared with sugar
  can be soaked 10-12 hours in a very little water and then both water and
  fruit used instead of raisins.  They will be much cheaper and will answer
  very well.  Economical housewives will often find hints like these very
  serviceable.

  dill pickle spears. And in many regions of Canada, venison, moose and

  Slice). These recipes appeared under the name Nanaimo Bars in the
  Vancouver Sun in the early 50's and in the B.C. Women's Institute
  Centennial of B.C. Cookbook in 1958. The test kitchens of food companies
  developed various versions with their own products.
  Since the 50s, endless variations include Minted, Grand Marnier, Cherry,
  Pina Colada, Mocha, and Peanut Butter Nanaimo Bars...During the 50s, a
  Dairy Food Service Bureau recipe called Dominoes suggested piping a little
  bit of the middle layer into dots on top to give a domino pattern when

 Categories: Acadian, French can, Breads, Desserts
   Servings:  1

-----------------------------------CRUST-----------------------------------
      3 c  Flour
      2 tb Baking powder
      1 ts -Salt
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2 c  Lard
      1 c  Milk

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      2 tb Butter; softened
      1 c  Brown sugar
      1 ts Cinnamon
      1 c  -Water

  To quote the author Marie Cormier-Boudreau, "These pastries which
  resemble cinnamon rolls, have been made throughout Acadia for many, many
  years. Although they are usually given the colourful name Pet de Soeurs
  (literally nun's fart), they are also be called (sic) Rosettes, Rondelles,
  Hirondells, Bourriques de veilles, Bourriques de soeurs or Bourriques de
  viarges (Rosettes, Slices, Swallows, Old Women's Belly Buttons, Nun's
  Belly Buttons and Virgin's Belly Buttons."

  Sift the dry ingredients together. Blend in the lard to form a coarse
  mixture. Gradually add the milk until a soft dough is formed. Roll the
  dough until it is fairly thin, although it should be thicker than a
  regular pie crust.
  Butter the dough with soft butter, cover with 1/4 inch of brown sugar and
  sprinkle with cinnamon. Roll the dough up like a jelly roll and slice into
  circles about 1/2 inch thick.
  Pour water into a casserole dish. Put the sliced dough into the casserole
  and bake at 375F for about 30 minutes or until the pets de soeur are
  golden brown.

  VARIATION: Cranberry jam may be substituted for the sugar and the
  cinnamon.

  did creep in, as indicated by this 75 year old recipe. (The book was
  published in 1971 so the recipe would be form the year 1894.)

      1 c  Flour
    1/2 ts -Salt
      1 tb Baking powder
    1/2 c  -Cold water

  "Although pot-en-pot contains the same ingredients as fricot, the method
  of preparation is significantly different. The most commonly used meats for
  this dish are chicken and hare but beef, pork, duck or goose may also be
  used. In Cheticamp and on the Magadalen Islands, pot-en-pot is called
  Etouffrage."

  Poultines Blanches:
  In a bowl, mix flour with salt and baking powder. Gradually add cold water
  to the dough as one would when making biscuits. Roll the dough fairly
  thin, cut into 1 1/2 inch  squares and place in fricot or other dish.
  Cut the meats into pieces. Place the pieces in a large pot with the salted
  water and bring to a boil. Simmer until the meat is tender. Remove the
  meat from the pot, reserving the stock.
   In the bottom of a second large pot, place a layer of potatoes, a layer
  of meat, a layer of chopped onion Season with salt, pepper and summer
  savory and continue adding until there are no ingredients left.
   Add the stock from the simmered meat and just enough water to cover
  three quarters of the ingredients. Cover and simmer for 45 minutes or
  until the potatoes are tender.
   Add Poutines Blanches (dumplings) 7 minutes before it is ready to be
  served, cover for the remaining 7 minutes.

  VARIATIONS: To vary the taste, other spices such as cumin or coriander may
  be added to the pot-en-pot. The meat may be sauteed before being simmered
  to improve it's flavour.  Handkerchief dumplings (included with Fricot a
  la Belette may be layered in with the ingredients at the beginning of the
  cooking time, instead of the dumplings used.

    1/4 c  Sugar, granulated; approx
      1 tb Baking powder
      1 ts -Salt
      2 tb Butter; or shortening
    1/4 c  Currants
      2    Eggs
    1/3 c  Milk
    3/4 c  Potatoes; mashed

  "Potato scones reflect the influence of the Scottish in the Maritimes and
  their adaptibility in using the famous P.E.I. potato...Scones were a
  favorite Scottish tradition. According to _A Treasury of Nova Scotia
  Recipes_ "the difference between bannock and scone (which the Scots rhyme
  with 'on', not 'bone') is that the bannock is a rather large, round cake,
  and the scone is a smaller triangle or 'farl'..But local usages vary
  considerably, Scots being strong individualists.
   A similar recipe for German Buns appears in an Ontario cookbook from the
  Kitchener area, where German settlers were predominant.
   When Their Majesties King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited Government
  House in Halifax on June 15,1939, scones were served. And Canadian Brits
  gathered for "tea at the Empress" in Victoria for scones and tea.

  In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt; cut in butter until
  mixture resembles coarse meal. Beat eggs lightly; reserve 1 Tbsp. With
  fork, stir into dry ingredients along with milk  and potatoes until well
  moistened.
  Knead gently on a lightly floured surface about 20 times. Roll or pat into
  circle 1/2 inch thick. Place onto ungreased baking sheet; brush with
  reserved egg yolk and sprinkle with more sugar. Cut into 16 wedges,
  separating slightly.
  Bake in 425F oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned.
  MAKES: 16 SCONES

  VARIATIONS: RAISIN SCONES: Add 3/4 cup raisins with dry ingredients
  OAT SCONES: Use 1/2 cup rolled oats in place of 1/2 cup flour

  Pouding Renverse des Bleuets

  Lemon-flavoured cake batter baked over fresh blueberries makes a perfect
  dessert. When I was immersed in French language studies at Jonqiere's
  Centre linguistique, Jeannine Renouf treated me to this recipe and also to
  a version that she makes with wild raspberries. It was a delectable kind
  of immersion.

    Combine blueberries, 1/4 cup of the sugar and lemon rind in a buttered 8
  inch square baking pan.
    In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, cream
  shortening with remaining 1/2 cup sugar until fluffy. Beat in egg and
  vanilla. Add dry ingredients alternately with milk, blending well after
  each addition and finishing with dry ingredients.
    Pour batter over fruit in pan and bake in a preheated 350F oven for
  about 40 minutes, or until a tester inserted in centre comes out clean.
  Let cool slightly; turn out onto serving plate. Cut in squares and serve
  warm or at room temperature, with whipped or ice cream, if desired.

   Servings:  6

    1/2 lb Salt pork, fatty
     10    Potatoes; finely grated
      4    Potatoes; cooked & mashed
           -Salt & Pepper

  "For many Acadians living in southeastern New Brunswick, Poultine Rapee,
  potato dumpling dish with a mixture of seasoned pork in the centre, is
  considered a national dish. In other parts of Acadia, these delicacies are
  prepared without the meat and fish is sometimes added to fricot. Although
  the greyish colour and gluey texture of the poutines makes them appear
  somewhat unappetizing, their taste more than compensates for their
  unattractive appearance."

  Soak the pork overnight in cold water to remove the salt, and cut into
  cubes.
  Extract the water from the grated potatoes by putting them in a cotton bag
  and squeezing vigourously.
  Mix the mashed potatoes with grated potatoes. Season with salt and pepper.
  Roll the potato mixture into balls resembling small snowballs. Make a hole
  in the centre of the potato ball and add 1 Tbsp of the salt pork. Close
  the hole and roll the poultines in flour.
  Gently drop the poultines 2 or 3 at a time, into a large pot of boiling
  salted water, ensuring that the water is kept at a rolling boil. Simmer
  the poultines for 2-3 hours.
  Eat the poultines hot with butter, salt and pepper, or as a dessert with
  sugar and molasses.

      Title: Quebec Apple Dumplings
 Categories: Desserts, Holiday, French can, Benoit
   Servings:  1

      1    Pie dough (double batch)
    1/4 c  Cheddar cheese-grated
     12    Apples; medium- peeled &
           -cored
    1/2 c  Mincement
    1/4 c  Rum
           Butter
    3/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Sugar; Brown
    1/4 c  Cream
           Lemon rind; 1/2 lemon

  Preheat oven to 400F. Make enough pie enough to roll into 12 6"x6" squares
  (about a double batch.) Sprinkle each square with 1 tsp grated cheddar.
  Peel and core apples and place one on each square. Fill the centre of each
  apple with 2 tsp (or 1 heaping tsp) of mincement, 1 tsp of rum, a dot of
  butter and 1 Tablespoon sugar. Bring diagonally opposite corners of dough
  over the apple to form ears at the top. Cover the 'ears' with aluminium
  foil. Mix the brown sugar, cream and grated lemon rind. Brush the
  dumplings with this mixture and bake 35 to 45 minutes in 400F oven.Remove
  foil, brush ears with cream mixture and return to oven till 'ears' are
  brown. Serve warm to plain cream or sweetened cream, flavoured with rum.

  Note from Anne MacLellan: Mme Benoit does not give total amounts for
  cheese, sugar, mincement and rum. I used Meal Master's conversion to
  decimal and back to calculate the total amounts.

  To quote Mme. Benoit,"In Quebec these were baked in deep brown
  earthenware pudding dishes and served on a hot wooden board or tray
  surrounded by autumn leaves or boughs cut from the Christmas tree. It was
  a traditional in our family to serve these dumplings after we had finished
  decorating the Christmas tree."

  "This date and nut cake always included a broiled topping. Lazy Daisy was
  a plain cake with the same topping. ...
  Queen Elizabeth cakes have appeared in cook books coast to coast for many
  years. Some claim that the recipe was a favorite of the Queen Mother and
  given to worthy groups as a fund raiser during World War II. One from
  Quebec's Eastern Townships includes the footnote that says that, "This is
  not to be passed on but must be sold for charitable purposes for 15 cents.
    In a reply to our query about the name of this recipe, the Queen
  Mother's Lady-in-Waiting writes; "I fear I have to tell you that, although
  we have known about this recipe for many years, it did not originate from
  either Buckingham Palace or Clarence House...However as Her Majesty always
  made it a rule, due to the number of requests received, never to give
  "favorite recipes", I fear that I have to tell you that you that should
  you wish to include this recipe in any cookbook, it should only be called
  a 'date and walnut cake' with no reference to the Queen Mother."

  Pour water over dates and soda; let stand until lukewarm. In bowl, cream
  butter with sugar; beat in egg and vanilla. Mix together flour, baking
  powder and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with date mixture.
  Spread in a greased and floured 9 inch square cake pan. Bake in 350F oven
  for 40 minutes or until tester comes out clean.

  Broiled Topping:
  In a small heavy saucepan, combine butter, packed brown sugar, light cream
  and coconut (half nuts if desired). Bring to a boil, stirring; boil gently
  for 1 minute. Spread over warm baked cake; broil until bubbly and lightly
  browned, watching carefully.

      1 c  Chopped green onions
    1/4    To 1/2 cup coarse salt

  These seasonings seem to be added to a lot of traditional French- Canadian
  recipes. "Herbs preserved with vegetables and salt make a lively seasoning
  for soups-particularly pea soup - sauces, stews and omelettes.  A
  commercial brand, Les Herbes Salees du bas du fleuve, is marketed by J.Y.
  Roy of St. Flavie, Quebec.  This recipe comes from the Metis district."

  In a large bowl, combine herbs and vegetables.  Layer 1 inch of herb
  mixture in the bottom of a crock or glass bowl and sprinkle with some of
  the salt.  Repeat layers until all of the herb mixture and salt is used.
  Cover and refrigerate for 2 weeks. Drain off accumulated liquid and pack
  herb mixture into sterilized jars.  Refrigerate until ready to use.  Makes
  about 5 to 6 cups.

  Conf: (1010) F-COOKING
  The book mentions Portable Soup (sometimes called Pocket Soup or Glue)
  that was made by simmering stock for 12 hours and then boiling/stirring
  constantly for 8. Then solid stock was formed into small cakes.
  Sea-faring men and woodsmen could carry them in their pockets.

  The Public Soup House in Halifax (spring 1818) distributed 100 gallons
  of soup daily made from 50 pounds of beef and vegetables.

  1 1/4 c  Milk
      1 ts -salt
    1/2 ts -pepper
           Paprika for garnish

  "A traditional Atlantic chowder is made with fish or shellfish, canned
  milk, potatoes, onions and is served with a dollop of butter. This
  version, which comes from a Nova Scotia fisherman and uses sour cream,
  fresh cream and thyme, is quite different and very good.
  When reheated leftover chowder, it may be necessary to add a little more
  milk or cream, because the fish and potatoes will have absorbed some of
  the liquid."

  Cook the onion in the butter until transparent. Add the thyme and celery
  salt. Remove from heat.
  In a saucepan, pour the whipping cream over the fish fillets.Cover, bring
  to a boil and simmer slowly for 10 minutes or till the fish flakes easily.
  Remove the fish with a slotted spoon, then break into small pieces and
  remove any bones.
  Add the onion mixture and the scallops to the poaching liquid. Bring to
  barely a boil, then simmer for about 1 minute or till the scallops are
  opaque. If the chowder is not to be eaten immediately, refrigerate
  everything at this stage.
  Just before serving, add the fish, lobster, sour cream, potatoes and milk.
  Heat through, but do not allow to boil. Season with salt and pepper.
  Ladle into soup bowls. Sprinkle with paprika. Serve immediately.

      Title: Tourtiere De Quebec (quebec Pork Pie)
 Categories: French can, Meats, Armstrong

  1 1/4 lb Ground pork
    1/2    To 3/4 cup cold water
    1/2 c  Onion, finely chopped
    1/4 c  Celery, finely chopped
    1/2 ts Ground black pepper
      1    Bay leaf
    1/2 ts Dried savoury

           Salt
    1/4 c  Old-fashioned rolled oats
           Pastry for double crust pie

  This is considered Quebec style, using rolled oats instead of potatoes to
  thicken the filling shows a Scottish influence.

  Servings:  6

  In a large, heavy frying pan, combine pork with cold water and heat to
  boiling point.  Add onion, celery, pepper, bay leaf, savoury, rosemary,
  nutmeg and cinnamon.  Cook, covered, over medium-low heat for 1 1/2 hours,
  adding more water if mixture dries out.  Halfway through cooking time,
  season with salt to taste.  Stir in rolled oats and cook, stirring, for 1
  to 2 minutes.  Remove bay leaf.

  Meanwhile, line a 9-inch pie plate with pastry.  When meat mixture is
  lukewarm, spoon into pie shell and cover with remaining pastry. Trim
  pastry, seal edges and cut steam vents in top crust.  Decorate with pastry
  cutouts as desired.  Bake in preheated 425 deg F oven for 15 minutes, then
  reduce heat to 375 deg F and bake another 25 minutes or until crust is
  golden.

      Title: Veau Dans Le Chaudron ( Veal Pot Roast)
 Categories: Meats, French can, Benoit
   Servings:  1

      3 tb Bacon fat or salad oil
      2    Garlic cloves, cut in half
      1    Veal - 1/2 leg or:
           -3 or 4 lb rolled shoulder
           -of veal
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/4 ts Thyme OR:
    1/2 ts Savory
      1    Bay leaf
      6    Potatoes - medium (6-8)
      6    Onions - medium (6-8)

  Melt or heat bacon fat or oil in cast iron saucepan. Stuff the 2 cloves of
  garlic, cut in two, into incisions made in the veal. Place the meat in the
  hot fat and brown well on all sides. Don't rush this as the colour and
  flavour of the finished gravy will depend on how well the meat has been
  browned. Add the thyme or savory and the bay leaf. Place the potatoes and
  onions, whole around the meat. Don't add any liquid. Cover tightly and cook
  over medium heat till meat is tender, about 2 hours. The potatoes and
  onions will not break as there is no liquid added. The veal will make its
  own gravy. When cooked, remove the meat from the pan to a heated platter.
  Place the pan over high heat and stir gently, so as not to break up the
  vegetables. When they are well coated with gravy, boil another minutes or
  so till the gravy has a nice consistency. This is a complete meal.

      1 ts Chicken bouillon

  Pour cold rice over rice in strainer and lift rice with fingers (to remove
  any impurities). Combine rice and 1 1/3 cups water and bouillon. Bring to a
  boil, reduce heat. Cover and simmer 60 minutes.* Meanwhile cook bacon
  partially and add mushrooms, green onion and thyme. Cook till bacon is
  crisp and mushrooms soft. Drain off fat. Add to cooked rice. Season with
  pepper. Sprinkle with chopped parsley. Time consuming and expensive. Be
  prepared to give wild rice as much cooking time as possible, occasionally
  it will require a bit more time as it absorbs water more slowly than
