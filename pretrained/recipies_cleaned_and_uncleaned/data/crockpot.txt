      1 ts Dried oregano
      1 ts Garlic powder
      1    Env. low-sod. ckn bouillon
    1/3 c  Low-cal Italian salad dsg.
    1/2 c  White wine
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce; **
 
  Spray crock inside with Vegetable Spray. Place drained mushrooms, drained
  artichoke hearts and chopped green onions in bottom of crockpot. Sprinkle
  vegetables with a heaping Tablespoon of quick-cooking tapioca and 1
  envelope of chicken bouillon (I use MBT brand of low-sodium chicken
  bouillon, but any will do). If you're using granulated bouillon, use about
  a heaping teaspoon. Place well-washed and dried boneless chicken breasts
  (all skin and fat removed). Combine remaining sauce ingredients and pour on
  top of chicken and vegetables. Cover and set crockpot on High. Cook 5-6
  hours or until tender. The tapioca thickens the sauce while it cooks (you
  can't even guess the tapioca is in there later). Hope you enjoy. Judy
  Garnett pjxg05a * I used Minute Maid fresh frozen lemon juice because I
  don't like the taste of Real-Lemon and I didn't have a fresh lemon on hand.
  ** I use Angostura brand low-sodium worcestershire

 Categories: Crockpot, Chicken, Mushrooms, Fruits, Spices
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 tb Frozen OJ
      2 c  Chicken stock
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/2 c  Tomato paste
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Brown sugar
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      1 ds Allspice
           Remaining ingredients:
      4 lb Chicken, breasts and thighs
    1/4 lb Mushrooms, sliced
      2 tb Margarine or butter
     11 oz (1 can) mandarin orange
           Sections, drained
    1/2    Of a medium-large bell
           Pepper, sliced lengthwise
    1/4 ts Ground ginger
      3 tb Cornstarch
    1/4 c  Cold milk
    1/4 c  Cold water
 
  Marinade:
  
  The night before you plan on slow cooking your dinner, mix together the
  marinade ingredients in a large, closable container large enough to also
  hold the chicken pieces.  When marinade is thoroughly mixed, add the
  chicken, close container and refrigerate until morning.
  
  In the morning place the chicken in the slow cooker and add marinade up to
  about an inch from the top of the container.  Set the cooker on low and
  cover.
  
  6 to 8 hours later, turn the cooker to high.  About an hour later, saute
  the sliced mushrooms in the margarine or butter. Then add the mushrooms
  (with pan juices), mandarin sections, green pepper and ginger into the slow
  cooker and stir thoroughly. Mix together the cornstarch, milk and cold
  water, then gradually add into the slow cooker while stirring until the
  entire mixture thickens a bit.
  
  Re-cover the slow cooker and let simmer for 15 to 30 minutes until serving.
  Serve with baby carrots and small new potatoes. From:

      Title: All-Day-Long Crockpot Beef
 Categories: Crockpot, Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Beef roast; * see note
    1/2 ts Black pepper
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
    1/2 pk Onion soup mix
      2 ts Worcestershire sauce
      1 ts Steak sauce
      3    Carrots; sliced
      2    Celery stalks; diced
      1    Green bell pepper; chopped
      1    Yellow onion
    1/2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Tomato juice
 
  Recipe by: Jo Anne Merrill Preparation Time: 8:00 * Use any cut of beef
  roast desired.
  
  :      1. Cut beef roast into serving-sized portions. Use more beef if you
  need more than 6 servings. Brown beef in a bit of vegetable oil, although
  you can skip this step if rushed for time.
  :      2. Slice onion and separate into rings. Dice the peeled carrots,
  dice the celery and slice the peppers into thin strips or circles. Place
  these into bottom of crockpot. Sprinkle the beef pieces with fresh ground
  black pepper, minced garlic and the onion soup mix. Place on top of the
  vegetables.
  :      3. Mix the steak sauce and Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl with
  about 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup tomato juice. Pour this over the meat.
  :      4. Turn the crockpot to high for 30 minutes, or, if you're in a
  hurry, skip this step. Turn to low, cover and cook for 7-9 hours.
  
  * Keep the crockpot covered as much as possible throughout cooking time. A
  crockpot can be used to cook this type of meal for a varied amount of time,
  depending on your schedule. It is not important that you take the meat and
  vegetables out at a specific amount of time. One or two hours either way
  usually makes no difference.
  
  :      When ready to serve, dip meat and vegetables out of pot with a
  slotted spoon. Use the liquid as is or turn crockpot to high and thicken
  liquid with a little flour or cornstarch. From:

    Spread bread with butter and toast both sides under a broiler. Cut bread
  into chunks.  Place all ingredients in the slow cooker except walnuts. The
  amount of sugar should be determined by tartness of apples. Set slow cooker
  on low and allow to cook for 5 to 6 hours. If possible, gently stir halfway

      Title: Apple Butter  Bgmb90b
 Categories: Jelly/jam, Fruits, Crockpot
      Yield: 5 1/2 jars
 
     14    Apples; quartered, leave
           -skin on. I use Granny Smith
           -any tart firm apple will do
      2 c  Cider; sweet
      2 c  Sugar; to taste
  1 1/2 ts Cinnamon; more or less
           Lemon juice; optional
           -use if apples are too sweet
 
  1 use my large Crockpot for this recipe.
  
  1. Combine all ingredients and cook in high stirring occasionally for the
  first hour or so; covered. Then remove cover and turn down to low and stir
  occasionally. This is a slow process since you have NOT precooked the
  apples.  Will take 24 to 36 hours. But you have NEVER tasted anything so
  good. I think it is much better this way then precooking the apples. I
  usually stir in the skin every hour or so but this is not critical. You can
  cook during the night but I usually do not.
  
  2. If the skin on your apples refuses to break down, use a hand held
  blender and zap it a few times. If you don't have one of these wonderful
  gadgets, then zap in the food processor.
  
  CANNING:  You can process this in a water bath but I usually just keep it
  in the fridge; it never lasts that long. NOTE: The skin is the substance
  that makes it thick along with the evaporation of the water. Please try it
  with the lid of the Crockpot off. It is better than MUSSELMANS. The
  grandgirls say the house smells like Apple Pie and they love it with Peanut
  Butter on bread or over cottage cheese.  We always used to bring that back
  from PA. Now I think I'll take this down. I hope you all enjoy!!!

      2 qt Sweet Cider
      4 lb Sweet But Tart Apples;
           -peeled, cored and sliced
      3 c  -Granulated Sugar; (about)
    1/4 ts -Cinnamon
    1/4 ts -Allspice
    1/8 ts -Ground Cloves
      1 ts -Salt
 
  Apple Butter 11 to 13 hours The big advantage in making preserve butters in
  a slow cooker is that you don't have to stir or stand over the pot waiting
  to stir. Adapt your favorite fruit butter recipes to fit the instructions
  and cooking time.
  
  To Cook: Place the cider and the apples in the slow cooker. Cover and cook
  on Low for 10 to 12 hours; do not stir. Rub the apples through a sieve;
  measure the apples and add as much sugar as there is apple. Add the spices
  and salt and return to the cooker. Cover, and cook on Low for another hour.
  Pour into clean, dry, 1/2-pint canning jars. Seal and process in a
  boiling-water bath or store in refrigerator. Makes 4 to 6 pints.

  Apple Cake 3 to 4 hours
  
  To Cook:  In a medium-large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder,
  salt, and 1 tablespoon granulated sugar. With two knives, cut the
  shortening into the flour until mixture is mealy. Make a well in the center
  and drop in the egg and milk. Stir in the flour mixture to form smooth
  batter, turn into greased 2-quart mold. Arrange the apples in rows on top,
  pushing them halfway into the dough. In a small bowl, mix the cinnamon,
  nutmeg and 2 tablespoons sugar. Sprinkle over the apples and dot with
  apricot jam. Drizzle butter over all. Place in the slow cooker and cover
  loosely with a plate. Cover the cooker, but prop the lid open a fraction

 Categories: Breads, Crockpot
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
------------------------DEIDRE-ANNE PENROD--FGGT98B------------------------
    3/4 c  Dried Apricots
      1 c  -All-Purpose Flour; sifted
      2 ts -Baking Powder
    1/4 ts -Baking Soda
    1/2 ts -Salt
    1/2 c  -Granulated Sugar
    3/4 c  -Milk
      1    Egg; slightly beaten

      1 tb -Vegetable Oil
    1/2 c  -Whole Wheat Flour; sifted
      1 c  Walnut Meats; chopped coarse

  To Cook:  Place the dried apricots on a chopping block. Measure the
  all-purpose flour and sprinkle 1 tablespoon of it over the apricots. Dip
  the cutting knife into the flour and chop the apricots finely. Flour the
  knife often to keep the cut-up fruits from sticking together. Sift the
  remaining all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and
  granulated sugar together into a large bowl. Combine the milk, egg, orange
  rind, and vegetable oil. Stir in the flour mixture and the whole wheat
  flour. Fold in the cut-up apricots, any flour left on the cutting block,
  and the walnut meats. Pour into a well-greased, floured, 1-quart mold.
  Cover with a loosely fitting plate and place on a rack or trivet in the
  slow cooker. Cover the cooker, but prop the lid open a fraction with a
  toothpick or a twist of foil to let excess steam escape. Cook on High for 2
  to 3 hours. Cool on a rack for 10 minutes. Serve warm or cold. Makes 4 to 6
  servings.

      2 tb Butter or margarine --
           (replace with what?)
 10 3/4 oz Cream of chicken soup,
           Condensed -- (or Crm of
           Celery)
    1/2 c  Dry sherry
      1 ts Tarragon or rosemary leaves
           (I like rosemary)
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
    1/4 ts Garlic powder -- or garlic
           Salt
      8 oz Canned mushrooms -- drained
 
  Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry; place in Crock-Pot.  In a saucepan,
  combine remaining ingredients and heat until smooth and hot.  Pour over
  chicken breasts.  Cover and cook on low setting for 8 to 10 hours.  (I did
  it on higher heat to speed things up. I added boiled potatoes and some
  paprika towards the end.) For the first time ever, I used those frozen
  boneless skinless bags of chicken. NOT BAD! Also, I have never been one to
  cook with soups before: have learned my lesson. Once cooked in this recipe,
  you cannot tell there is canned soup as base for sauce. This is delish!!!

      Title: Banana Bread #1
 Categories: Breads, Crockpot
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
------------------------DEIDRE-ANNE PENROD--FGGT98B------------------------
  1 3/4 c  -All-Purpose Flour; sifted
      2 ts -Baking Powder
    1/4 ts -Baking Soda
    1/2 ts -Salt
    1/3 c  -Shortening
    2/3 c  -Granulated Sugar
      2    Eggs; well beaten
      2 tb -Dark Corn Syrup
  1 1/2 c  Ripe Bananas; well mashed,
           -(2 or 3 bananas)
    1/2 c  Walnut Meats; (optional)
 
  Banana Bread 2 to 3 hours
  
  Banana Bread leftovers keep well in the refrigerator and can be sliced and
  toasted before serving again. Banana Bread also freezes well. Use overripe
  bananas for this - often they're on sale for very little.
  
  To Cook. Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together.
  With the electric beater on low, fluff the shortening until soft and creamy
  in a small bowl. Or beat by hand until fluffy. Add the sugar gradually.
  Beat in the eggs and dark corn syrup in a slow stream. With a fork, beat
  into the shortening a third of the bananas, half the flour, another third
  of the bananas, the remaining flour, and the last of the bananas. Fold in
  the walnut meats. Turn into a greased and floured 1 1/2-quart mold and
  cover with a loosely fitting plate. Place the mold on a rack or a trivet in
  the cooker. Cover the cooker, but prop the lid open a fraction with a
  toothpick or a twist of foil to let excess steam escape. Cook on High for 2
  to 3 hours, or until the bread is done. Cool on a rack for 10 minutes, then
  turn the bread out of the mold. Dust over with brown sugar and serve warm.
  Makes 6 to 8 servings. Source: "Clear & Simple Crockery Cooking", by

           Potatoes
           Bacon
 
   heres a hint for you...bake your potatoes in your crock pot. if you are
  going to barbecue later in the day., put your taters in the crock in the
  morning over a plate, add bacon and spices to some water in the
  bottom..make sure taters DONT touch the water. also you can cut the taters
  in half, season, insert bacon slice, wrap back together with foil, and
  place in crock..cover with more foil and lid, set temp on llow and cook all
  day without worrying about them.  They taste like they were on the fire but
  werent! if you really like em smokey, add liquid smoke to the water in the
  bottom...use about an inch of water for a full 6 qt crock pot. Posted on

      Title: Barbeque Beef
 Categories: Crockpot, Bbq, Beef
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           -KAREN VISOCKY
      4 lb Brisket, round roast OR
      2 lb Boneless beef short ribs
      1    Onion; sliced
    1/2    Green pepper; diced
      1 c  BBQ sauce;(or more)to taste
 
  Brown meat in heavy skillet. Put onion and pepper in bottom of the
  crockpot, placing the roast on top of vegs., and then pour the sauce over
  meat. When doing short ribs, I layer the meat and veggies, then pour in the
  sauce.  ADD NO ADDITIONAL LIQUID!  Cover and cook on LOW for 8-10 hours
  (HIGH for 4 - 5 hours).  When meat is done, remove from pot with spatula &
  place on a broiler pan. Pour some of the juices and sauce over meat and
  place under broiler for 5-10 min., turning once. You can allow the juices
  to thicken in the pot to serve with the meat. You can also use that recipe
  for Spareribs, using 2 cups of BBQ sauce for 3 to 4 pounds of spareribs.

      Title: Barbeque Pork
 Categories: Main dish, Pork, Meats, Sandwich, Crockpot
      Yield: 32 Sandwiches
 
      4 lb Pork Butt or Shoulder Roast;
           -lean, boneless
      2 lg Spanish onions; (sweet)
      1 lg Bottle Kraft Honey BBQ Sauce
           -OR KC Masterpiece BBQ Sauce
      1 c  Ginger Ale (or Coke)
      4 pk Sandwich buns (8 per pkg.)
 
   Cut onions in half lengthwise, slice in 1/4" slices, halve the slices and
  separate into rings.  Trim all possible fat from roast and sprinkle with
  garlic salt and seasoned pepper. Place half the onions in crockpot, put in
  roast and top with rest of onions. Pour 1 cup of soda over all, cover and
  cook on LOW for 10 to 12 hours, or overnight until pork can be easily
  shredded with two forks.
   Remove pork from pot, shred in a bowl, removing all possible fat. Remove
  onions with slotted spoon and add to bowl. Discard juice in pot. Return
  onions and pork to pot, add BBQ sauce to all and mix. Continue to cook on
  LOW for 5 to 6 hours, adding more BBQ sauce as needed. Serve as sandwiches
  in buns.  (I use Pepperidge Fram Sandwich rolls).
   Leftovers may be cooled, made into  sandwiches, wrapped in heavy plastic
  wrap and frozen individually for later use. (I store them in the sandwich
  roll bags, 8 to a bag, sealed with the tab that came with the bag). They
  keep well and may be unwrapped, rewrapped in paper towels and heated in a
  microwave at 50% for a few minutes.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           -BONNIE LEE
      4 lb Boston pork butt
      1    Bottle BBQ Saucee
 
  Cook Boston pork butt all day, or until it is so tender it falls apart
  easily.  Romove from pot and let it cool slightly, but do not let it get
  cold.  Pull meat away from fat (remove fat and discard) and shred meat with
  two forks.  Return meat to crockpot and add a bottle of your favorite
  barbeque sauce (I like KC Masterpiece, or Kraft Honey Barbeque sauce) and
  stir until thoroughly combined. Continue cooking until heated through. This
  makes great sandwiches on buns, or meat entree. Great with coleslaw and
  baked beans.

 Categories: Crockpot, Main dish, Work food
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
--------------------------IOWA REC NEWS, MAY 1992--------------------------
 
  1 lb Kidney beans, dry 1 pk Smoked Polish sausage,sliced 7 c Water 1 c
  Barley 2 Garlic cloves; peeled 3 Bay leaves
  
  Put rinsed beans in large saucepan. Add water, cover and let stand
  overnight.
  
  Drain off water the next day. Put beans, barley and remaining ingredients
  into crockpot.  Stir.  Cover and cook on high for 4 hours. Remove bay
  leaves.  Salt to taste when serving.
  
  Sylvia's comments:  I nuked the beans to fast-soak them, and it worked
  great.  Even the kids liked this one!  I used a fine-ground wurst instead
  of Polish sausage and cut it into bite-sized pieces before cooking. I also
  added some powdered beef stock to the water for cooking. Then I packed the
  soup into empty jars to take to work.  It reheats great! Also worked well
  for a quick supper for the kids. Definitely a keeper. I might add some
  chopped browned onions next time, though.

  the pot, add beef cubes. Mix flour, pepper and spices and sprinkle over
  beef. Add rest of veggies and top with the stewed tomatoes and their juice.
  Sprinkle with Worcestershire sauce. Cover and cook on LOW 8 to 10 hours, or
  until meat is very tender and veggies are done. If desired, potatoes may be
  omitted and the stew, when done, may be served with large macaroni cooked
  separately. Leftovers can be refrigerated all in the same pot and reheated
  in bowls in the microwave at 50% power.

  (cooking a little meat at a time until all is browned). Place meat in a
  large pot and add about 3 cups beef broth, Worcestershire, garlic, bay
  leaf, paprika, carrots, onions and celery. Stir to mix. Cook over medium
  heat until it comes to a slow boil, reduce to low and continue cooking (4
  hours or so) until the liquid is reduced and meat is tender, stirring
  frequently.  Add potatoes and continue cooking about another 30 minutes or
  until potatoes are tender. Do not use Kitchen Bouquet. If necessary, add a
  little flour mixed with water to thicken. From:

      Title: Beef-Noodle Stew
 Categories: Stew, Crockpot, Beef
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
----------------------------WOMAN'S DAY; 2/1/94----------------------------

---------------------------------BASIC STEW---------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Boneless beef chuck
      1 c  Stock
    3/4 c  Onions, chopped
    1/2 tb Garlic cloves, crushed

-------------------------------THIS VARIATION-------------------------------
      3 c  Beef stock
    1/2 c  Water
    1/4 c  Oyster sauce; or black bean
     16 oz Mixed vegetables; NOT thawed
      8 oz Capellini; thin spaghetti
        sl Green onions; for garnish
 
  You may substitute lamb or pork shoulder for the beef. Use beef stock for
  beef, chicken stock for pork or lamb.
  
  Basic stew: Trim meat of fat and cut into 1-1/2" chunks. Bring all
  ingredients to boil in 4-qt pot, cover tightly, reduce heat, and simmer
  2-1/2 hours, until meat is tender. Crockpot directions: pile all
  ingredients into crockpot and cook all day on LOW. When done: skim off and
  discard fat.
  
  It takes less than 8 minutes to assemble this stew. Then you can pay it
  little or no attention as it simmers for about 2-1/2 hours. Make multiples
  of the basic stew, then divide stew into 4-serving portions; refrigerate or
  in airtight containers for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw
  in microwave-safe container on defrost or in refrigerator for 24 hours.
  
  To assemble: heat basic stew, stock, water, and oyster sauce in 4-qt pot
  over medium heat until boiling gently. Stir in vegetables. Coo9k 5 minutes,
  until thawed and hot. Add pasta and, stirring almost constantly, cook 3
  minutes, until pasta is firm but tender and stock is thickened.
  
  Lamb and pork would be good here, too.  Oyster sauce and black bean sauce
  are available in the Asian-food section of your market. Keep in mind that
  noodles will continue to absorb liquid, so this stew should be served
  immediately.  If you're not sure how soon it will be eaten, cook noodles
  separately, thicken stock with 2 tb cornstarch stirred into 1/2 c cold
  water, and then add cooked noodles just before serving.

   Those who like a strong beer taste will want the pieces that actually
  bathed in the beer.  The pieces toward the top of the crock pot will have a
  more delicate beery tang. During the 2 hours of cooking, the alcohol in the
  beer will evaporate completely, so the whole family can enjoy these.

      Title: Belgian Pot Roast
 Categories: Meat, Crockpot
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Beef
    1/2 c  Water
      1 ea Onions
      1 tb Sugar, brown
      1 ea Garlic cloves, crushed
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Black pepper
    1/2 ts Sage
    3/4 c  Beer
      1 tb Vinegar, wine
 
  Simmer meat and water in Dutch oven for about 1 hour, covered.
   Then remove lid and allow water to boil away, so that meat ends up
  browning in its own fat.  Adjust heat so that the meat juices that coat the
  pan do not burn.  When meat is browned, remove from pan and reserve. Pour
  out fat.
  
  Thinly slice onion and add to pan; saute over gentle heat, scraping up
  browned particles.  Add sugar and continue cooking until onions are a rich
  brown.  Add garlic and saute for a few seconds. Return meat to pan (or
  remove meat and onions to crockpot), and add salt, pepper, sage, and beer.
  (The Belgians would use a DARK full-bodied ale.)  Simmer until meat is fork
  tender.  Depending upon the cut, this will take a total time of 1-1/2 to 3
  hours.
  
  Add vinegar when cooked.  Serve with rice, noodles or boiled potatoes. This
  braised dish will be improved by being made in advance and reheated.
  
  Notes:  this meat will probably take 6-10 hours on low in the crockpot.

      Title: Blueberry Muffins #1
 Categories: Breads, Muffins, Crockpot
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
------------------------DEIDRE-ANNE PENROD--FGGT98B------------------------
      2 c  -All-Purpose Flour; sifted
      3 ts -Baking Powder
      1 ts -Salt
      2 tb -Granulated Sugar
      1    Egg; slightly beaten
      1 c  Whole Milk
      6 tb Butter; melted
           ----OR----
      6 tb -Vegetable Oil
      1 c  Blueberries; washed/drained
      3 tb -Granulated Sugar
 
  Blueberry Muffins 2 1/2 to 3 hours
  
  These are my family's morning favorites. I use the timer to make these turn
  up ready for breakfast. You will need 6 large or 10 or 12 small pyrex cups.
  Or make it as a bread in a souffle dish. Mix half the recipe unless you
  have a very large cooker.
  
  To Cook:  Into a medium bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, salt, and 2
  tablespoons sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the egg, milk, and
  melted butter or oil. Stir together until mixed. Don't beat. Fold in the
  blueberries mixed with 3 tablespoons sugar. Divide the batter among the
  well-greased Pyrex cups, filling each only halfway. Place half the cups on
  a trivet in the bottom of the slow cooker. Set a Pyrex mold or pie plate
  over the cups to make room for a second layer of cups. Cover the top layer
  of cups loosely with a plate. Set the timer so that the muffins will start
  cooking on Low 2 1/2 to 3 hours before breakfast time. If using muffin cups
  as described above, halve the recipe. Makes 12 muffins.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
------------------------DEIDRE-ANNE PENROD--FGGT98B------------------------
      1 c  -Whole Wheat Flour
      1 c  -Rye Flour
      1 c  Yellow Cornmeal
      2 ts -Baking Soda
  1 1/2 ts -Salt

  1 1/2 c  Buttermilk
      1 c  Seedless Raisins
      2 c  -Hot Water
 
  Boston Brown Bread 3 to 4 hours
  
  This is great with baked beans and franks. It's dark and dense, and
  leftovers make wonderful toast.
  
  To Cook:  In a large bowl, combine the whole wheat and rye flour, cornmeal,
  baking soda, and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the molasses,
  buttermilk, and raisins. Stir until all the ingredients are combined.
  Grease a 2- quart mold, flour it, and fill. The batter should not fill more
  than 2/3 of the mold. Cover with foil and tie with string. Set the mold on
  a trivet in the bottom of the slow cooker. Pour the hot water into the pot,
  cover the pot, and cook on High for 3 to 4 hours. The bread is done when
  the top is dry and recedes from the edge of the mold. Cool the bread on a
  rack for 10 minutes, then turn out and serve. Makes 1 loaf.

      Title: Brachiola
 Categories: Beef, Oven meals, Crockpot, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           -LISA HLAVATY
      2 lb Boneless round steak;
           -1/4" thick and pounded
    1/2 c  Bread crumbs
    1/2 c  Parmesan cheese
      1    Clove garlic; minced
      1    Egg; beaten
    1/4 ts Pepper
      2    Hard boiled eggs; sieved
      2 c  Meatless spaghetti sauce
 
   Mix together bread crumbs, cheese, garlic, beaten egg, pepper and sieved
  eggs. Spread over steak. Roll up meat and tie at 1" intervals. Spread 1 cup
  spaghetti sauce in bottom of baking pan slightly larger than meat roll.
  Place meat on sauce and cover with remaining sauce.Cover and bake at 350
  degrees F. for 2 to 3 hours, or until fork tender. Serve on top of
  spaghetti.
   JEAN'S SUGGESTION:  This might cook very well in a crockpot with a meat
  rack, on LOW for 6 to 8 hours, or until very tender. In that case, I would
  lower the amount of spaghetti sauce used, to 3/4 to 1 cup, to allow for the
  meat juices that would cook out.

 Categories: Crockpot
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
 
        3 lb Brisket
    1 1/2 lb Green beans
        6    Potato -- peel/quarter
      1/4 ts Marjoram -- crumbled
  :          Salt & pepper -- to taste
  
  1-   Wipe meat and place in large pot. Cover with about 2 cups water.
  Vegetables may be added to the meat in a crock pot along with seasonings
  and the whole thing cooked 1O hours.  2-  In a dutch oven, simmer 2 to 2
  1/2 hours before adding vegetables, then continue until potatoes are done.
  3-  In a pressure cooker, bring brisket, water and seasonings to 15 #
  pressure and cook for 3O to 4O minutes. Reduce pressure under cold water,
  open cooker, add vegetables, cover, bring to 15# pressure and cook 5
  minutes, reduce pressure again.       However you cook it, remove meat,
  slice  thinly on the diagonal, serve with green beans and potatoes drenched
  with  cooking liquid. Do not thicken the natural gravy.   It has a lovely
  flavor and should not be greasy. If your meat is not well trimmed,  remove
  excess fat before cooking. Should you have leftovers, heat the  remaining
  liquid and slice the meat for open face or French dip hot sandwiches.

      Title: Caramel Custard

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
------------------------DEIDRE-ANNE PENROD--FGGT98B------------------------
      4 md Eggs
      1 ts -Vanilla
  3 1/2 c  Whole Milk
  4 1/2 c  -Granulated Sugar
    1/2 c  -Boiling Water
 
  Caramel Custard 2 to 4 hours
  
  A custard dessert to serve with caramel sauce. Make it a day ahead so it
  can be chilled or bake it overnight in your slow cooker and chill it until
  dinner.
  
  To  Cook: Beat the eggs with an electric beater until thick. Add the
  vanilla and beat until lemon colored. Add the milk and 2 1/2 cups of the
  sugar; with the beater on low, combine well. Butter a 2-quart mold. In a
  heavy medium- sized skillet melt the remaining 2 cups of sugar over a very
  low heat. When it begins to bubble and turn brown, stir to combine all the
  sugar in the skillet. When the caramelizing sugar is a medium brown, pour
  half the caramel into the bottom of the mold. Into the other half of the
  caramelized sugar in the skillet, pour 1/2 cup of boiling water. Stir over
  low heat until the mixture bubbles; allow it to cool, then chill for use as
  sauce. Pour the egg and milk mixture into the mold. Pour 2 cups of hot
  water into the slow cooker and place the mold on a trivet or rack in the
  bottom. Cover the pot, but prop the lid open a fraction with a toothpick or
  a twist of foil to allow excess steam to escape. Cook on High for 2 to 4
  hours or until a silver knife inserted in the center of the custard comes
  out clean. Chill, covered, in the refrigerator, then unmold and serve with
  caramel sauce over the top. Makes 6 to 8 servings.

      Title: Cherry Pound Cake
 Categories: Cakes, Crockpot
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
------------------------DEIDRE-ANNE PENROD--FGGT98B------------------------
      1 pk Pound Cake Mix; (16 oz)
    2/3 c  -Water
      2    Whole Eggs
     20    To 30 Marachino Cherries;
           -drained
      3 tb -All-Purpose Flour
 
  Cherry Pound Cake 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours
  
  My mother used to make this from scratch, but it's much easier with a pound
  cake mix. Refrigerate leftovers wrapped in plastic film.
  
  To  Cook: Turn the cake mix, water, and eggs into a large mixing bowl and
  beat with an electric beater on low. In a small bowl, combine the
  maraschino cherries with the flour. Toss the cherries well in the flour so
  that all the moisture on the cherries is absorbed. Pour the batter into a
  greased and floured 2-quart mold or spring-form pan, Drop the cherries into
  the batter from high enough up so they sink into it. (This maneuver keeps
  all the cherries, which are heavier than the batter, from sinking to the
  bottom of the cake.) Place the pan in the slow cooker and cover with a
  loosely  fitting plate. Cover the pot, but prop the lid open a fraction
  with a toothpick or a twist of foil to let excess steam escape. Cook on
  High for 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours. When a toothpick inserted in the center of
  the cake comes out clean, the cake is done. Cool the cake on a rack for 10
  to 15 minutes before you turn it out of the pan. Let it cool thoroughly
  before serving. Makes 10 to 12 servings. Source: "Clear & Simple Crockery

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           -ROY CROCKETT JR.
      1    Chicken; whole
      1 c  Ketchup
      1 c  Cola; regular not diet
 
  Prepare the chicken for cooking like you normally would. Remove any parts
  from the cavity, wash inside and out, pat dry, salt and pepper inside
  cavity if you like. We also use Luzianne Cajun Seasoning. We like onion, so
  I chop up an avialable onion. I then put 1/2 of the chopped onion inside
  the cavity along with the seasoning. Mix the ketchup and cola. Place in the
  pot and pour the ketchup mix over the chicken. Put the remaining onion in
  the pot and sprinkle your favorite seasoning over the chicken. Put lid on
  pot, cook on low for 8 to 12 hours depending on your busy day or night. We
  enjoy the sauce over rice and round out the meal with a green vegetable.

      Yield: 2 Servings
 
           -
      1 ea Chicken
      3 tb Butter
    1/2 tb Mustard -- Dijon
    1/2 c  Juice -- orange
    1/4 c  Sugar -- brown
           -
      1 tb Cornstarch
    1/4 c  Water
    1/8 c  Vodka
           ROAST-----
           SAUCE-----
 
  Cut chickens in half lengthwise.  Blend butter and mustard together. Rub
  chicken inside and out with this mixture.  Place chicken, skin side down,
  in baking dish with tight-fitting cover.
  
  Preheat oven to 375. Combine orange juice and brown sugar, stirring until
  sugar is completely dissolved. Pour over and around chicken. Cover and bake
  for 30 minutes.
  
  Turn chicken over, baste with pan juices, and continue to bake, uncovered,
  for 20 minutes longer, basting occasionally.
  
  Remove chicken to heated platter and keep warm.  Mix cornstarch with water.
  Stir this into juices from pan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly,
  until thickened. Remove from heat, stir in vodka, and pour sauce over
  chicken.
  
  Sylvia's comments: I'm unenthusiastic about this one, and I'm not sure why.
  The chicken was pretty bland, but chicken usually tastes bland to me, and
  the sauce was certainly flavorful.  The combination of mustard and orange
  juice didn't do a thing for my taste buds.  It also took about 1/2 hour
  longer to bake than the recipe called for. Next time, I think I'll leave
  out the mustard/butter rub, add a little pumpkin pie spice to the orange
  juice/brown sugar mixture, and cook the whole mess in the crockpot rather
  than the oven.

      Title: Chicken Noodle Soup New Orleans Style
 Categories: Soups, Chicken, Hot, Crockpot
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lg Whole fryer
      1 c  Diced onions
    1/2 c  Diced celery
    1/2 c  Minced parsley
      4    Cloves minced garlic
      1 c  Chopped carrots
      3    Bay leaves
      1 ts Poultry seasoning
      4 qt Bottled water (I used
           -regular tap water)
     12 oz Broad egg noodles
      2 tb Butter
      1 c  Sliced onion rings
      1 c  Sliced mushrooms (I left
           -these out)
      1 c  Diced carrots
    1/4 c  Cream sherry
 
  SOURCE      Cathy Keller
  
  salt and pepper to taste green onions for garnish (we didn't have any, but
  would imagine it would be fantastic)
  
  First, take the chicken and wash it thoroughly - that means both inside and
  out!  Remove the giblets, scrub out the internal cavity under cold running
  water, and scrape away anything that doesn't look edible. (But DO NOT
  remove the chicken skin or any of the fat!  You need the skin to make a
  rich stock.) Next, take a crock pot (see Note below if you don't have a
  crock pot) and place the chicken and giblets into it. Then drop in the
  diced onions, the 1/2 c of celery, the 1/2 c of minced parsley, the garlic,
  chopped carrots and bay leaves, poultry seasoning and *2 * quarts of water.
  Then, with a spoon, evenly distribute the seasoning mixture around the
  chicken, turn the crock pot to high, and cook for at least six hours (or
  better still, OVERNIGHT).  Remember, the longer you cook, the richer the
  base stock and the more tender the chicken. While the chicken is
  slow-cooking, it's a good time to prepare your noodles.  Go ahead and boil
  them according to package directions... but DO NOT COOK THEM UNTIL DONE!
  Keep in mind that you're going to drop them into a soup, so you want them
  el dente (firm), otherwise they'll turn to pure mush by the time you eat
  them.  Furthermore, you want a small percent of the starch in the noodles
  to cook into the soup to thicken it slightly - if you cook the noodles all
  the way, the soup's consistency will be flat and thin. After the noodles
  are cooked, butter them slightly and set them aside. When the chicken is
  tender, take a set of tongs or a strainer spoon, remove it from the crock
  pot (it may tend to fall apart, but that's okay), and set it on a platter
  to cool.  At this point, strain out all the seasoning vegetables from the
  stock, place the stock into a metal bowl, and place the bowl into the
  refrigerator or freezer until the chicken fat congeals (which should take
  about 1 hour). Meanwhile, pick the chicken off the bones and, with a sharp
  knife, chop it into bit-sized pieces. Then, in a heavy 12-inch skillet,
  melt the butter and saute the sliced onions, mushrooms, and carrots until
  they're tender. Then drop in the chopped chicken meat. And over medium-low
  heat, cook it into the vegetables for about 10 minutes. While the chicken
  and vegetables are sauteing, remove the chicken stock from the
  refrigerator, skim off all the fat, and place the skimmed stock into a soup
  pot, along with the remaining 2 quarts of water. At this point, you should
  season the soup stock to taste with salt and pepper. Now drop in the
  sauteed chicken, mushrooms, onion rings and diced carrots - along with the
  sherry, the Tabasco*, and as soon as it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to
  low and simmer the soup for about 30 minutes to allow all the flavors to
  thoroughly blend. When you're ready to eat, ladle out heaping helpings of
  the piping hot soup into bowls, garnish with a sprinkling of thinly sliced
  green onions, and serve with crunch saltines.
  
  *I just put a couple of drops of Tabasco in there -- Michelle, how much are
  we supposed to put in there?

 Categories: Pasta, Chicken, Crockpot
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4    To 6 chicken leg quarters
           A bit of chicken stock,
           -water, or white vermouth
           A few bay leaves
      1 md Yellow onion, chopped
           A few Tbsp olive oil
      5    Cloves garlic, chopped or
           -pressed
      2    (16 oz) cans of tomato sauce
     16 oz Can of stewed tomatoes
     16 oz Can of tomato puree
      2    Or 3 ribs of celery, sliced,
           -optional
 
  Here's what I've done a time or four. This "recipe" has not been cooked
  often enough to be stabilized and really called a recipe. Still, there have
  been no complaints and many requests for seconds.
  
  A tsp to a Tbsp or so of the following (to taste): Onion powder Garlic
  powder (NOT garlic salt) Ground black pepper Ground red pepper (cayenne)
  Ground white pepper Basil Parsley Paprika Oregano Spaghetti
  
  Put the chicken into a crockpot early in the day.  It's fine if they are
  still frozen.  Add as little liquid as possible. Water, chicken stock, or a
  bit of white vermouth, or a combination works fine.  Add a couple of bay
  leaves, and some salt.  Turn the crockpot on low and go to work (or carry
  on your normal day's activities.
  
  When you get home, or in the evening, turn off the crockpot.  Put water  on
  to boil the spaghetti.  Remove chicken from the crockpot and discard skin
  and bones.
  
  In a deep pot, heat olive oil.  Add onion and garlic and cook until the
  onions are clear. Add tomato sauce, stewed tomatoes, tomato puree, the
  chicken and about a cup of the chicken broth from the crockpot.  (If you
  add too much broth, the sauce will be too soupy; if you add too little, the
  chicken taste will be a bit weak.)  Stir, cutting up the whole tomatoes.
  Add celery, onion powder, garlic powder, peppers, basil, parsley, paprika,
  and oregano.  Cook, stirring from time to time, while the water for the
  spaghetti comes to a boil.  Cook spaghetti, drain and serve with grated
  Parmesan cheese on the side.

  Saute over low heat until onion is just tender, 5-10 minutes.
  
  Add stock, cinnamon, curry powder, cumin, turmeric, and black pepper. Stir,
  bring to boil, reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes.
  
  Peel turnip; dice turnip, zucchini, carrot, and bell pepper. Add dark meat
  and diced vegetables to Dutch oven.  Simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes.
  
  Dice tomatoes.  Add chicken breasts, tomato, raisins, and parsley, pushing
  down lightly to be sure ingredients are covered by liquid. Simmer, covered,
  for 10 minutes more.
  
  Serve hot in deep soup bowls on top of rice, noodles, or couscous,
  garnishing top with coriander.
  
  Sylvia's notes: I used a whole chicken and dumped everything in the
  crockpot, which worked fine except that the vegetables weren't done (since
  it cooked about 6 hours instead of the usual 10 when I use the cp on a
  workday), so I boiled the vegetables in the stock until they were soft.
  However, I was not pleased with the result, and I think it was the
  combination of flavors (or lack thereof) rather than the cooking method.
  The chicken was fine, and the broth was delicious, but the vegetables were
  tasteless cardboard.

      Title: Chuck-Wagon Bean Pot
 Categories: Crockpot, Soups, Usenet
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Bean (any variety), dry
      1    Ham hock or shank
      1 lg Onion, chopped
      6 c  Water
      1 t  Salt
      7 oz Green chili salsa
           -(up to 10 oz; or use
           -tomato sauce, canned
           -or stewed tomatoes)
 
  Rinse the beans and remove any foreign matter.  Mix all ingredients in the
  cooking vessel.
  
  IF USING A SLOW-COOKER:  Cover, set temperature at low, and forget for at
  least 10 hours.  If you have only half a day, cook the mixture 5 or more
  hours on high.
  
  IF USING A STOVE:  Heat all ingredients to boiling with pot uncovered. Turn
  down heat, cover, and simmer gently, adding enough boiling water to keep
  beans well covered. Most bean varieties will be done in 2 to 3 hours.
  
  When beans are done, take out ham bone, cut off the meat and put it back
  into the pot. Serve hot with corn bread or muffins. Green chili salsa is a
  Mexican sauce made from green chili peppers, onions, vinegar and other
  ingredients.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A Hearty Bean Stew -- I got this recipe from "A Primer on Bean Cookery"
  by the California Dry Bean Advisory Board and other organizations. This
  savory stew, featuring ham and beans, borrows its robust seasonings from
  the chuck wagon cooks of the old western cattle ranges. The secret is long,
  slow cooking, and your electric slow-cooker is ideal for the job. Just
  follow the directions that come with your particular model. If you don't
  have one, slow-cook the mixture on top of the stove in a heavy pot with a
  lid.
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, many hours cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

------------------------DEIDRE-ANNE PENROD--FGGT98B------------------------
  1 1/4 c  -All-Purpose Flour
    3/4 c  Yellow Cornmeal
    1/4 c  -Granulated Sugar
  4 1/2 ts -Baking Powder
      1 ts -Salt
      1    Egg; slightly beaten
      1 c  -Milk
    1/3 c  Butter; melted
           ----OR----
    1/3 c  -Vegetable Oil
 
  Corn Bread from Scratch 2 to 3 hours
  
  Corn bread mix is so successful you really don't need to make it from
  scratch, but it costs more than a hand-mixed version. I grease the mold for
  corn bread with bacon drippings.
  
  To Cook: In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking
  powder, and salt. Make a well in the center. Turn the egg, milk, and melted
  butter or oil into the well and beat into the dry mixture until just
  moistened. Turn into a greased 2-quart mold, cover with a plate, and place
  on a trivet or rack in the bottom of the slow cooker. Cover the cooker,
  cook on high for 2 to 3 hours. Makes 6 servings.

      1 md Onion, sliced
    1/2 ts Celery seed
    1/2 ts Mustard seed
     10 ml Garlic, minced
      1    Bay leaf
           Water
      1 sm Cabbage head, cut into
 
  1) Place meat, with liquid & spices from package in slow cooking pot. Add
  onion, celery seed, mustard seed, garlic & bay leaf. Add just enough water
  to cover meat, about 4 cups. Cover & cook at Setting #3 (low) for 7-9 hours
  or until meat is fork tender.
  
  2) During last hour of cooking, add cabbage wedges and continue cooking @
  setting #3, (low). Discard cooking liquid & spices.
  
  **NOTE: This is really good. I did something different. At the end of meat
  cooking, I strained the liquid, put it in a pot on the stove and put the
  wedged cabbage in, at a simmer to cook. I just kept the meat warm until
  serving time.

  for 4 people. It was easy to do and delicious. Would make a wonderful

      Title: Cranberry Bread #3
 Categories: Breads, Crockpot
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
------------------------DEIDRE-ANNE PENROD--FGGT98B------------------------
      2 c  Fresh Cranberries; (1/2 lb)
      2 c  -All-Purpose Flour
      1 c  -Granulated Sugar
    1/2 ts -Baking Powder
    1/2 ts -Baking Soda
    1/2 ts -Salt
      6 tb Butter; at room temperature
      1    Whole Egg
      1 tb Orange Peel; grated
    1/2 c  Orange Juice
    1/2 c  Walnut Meats; chopped
 
  Cranberry Bread 2 1/2 to 3 hours
  
  This is a Cape Cod specialty. In the restaurants there, a basket of sliced
  cranberry bread is served with each meal. It's best buttered and eaten
  fresh, but leftovers -toasted and buttered - make a wonderful breakfast
  food. Cranberry Bread freezes well and keeps fresh for many days in the
  refrigerator if well wrapped in plastic. To Cook: A quarter cup at a time,
  chop the cranberries in the blender on low. Don't puree them, which is what
  will happen if you blend them too long. In a large bowl, sift the flour,
  sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. With two knives, cut the
  butter into the flour mixture until it looks like coarse meal. Combine the
  egg, orange peel, and orange juice and stir into the flour mixture until
  well blended. Fold in the cranberries and the walnut meats. Turn into a
  greased 2-quart mold. Cover with a loosely fitting plate. Place the mold on
  a rack or trivet in the slow cooker. Cover the cooker, but prop the lid
  open a fraction with a tooth- pick or a twist of foil to let excess steam
  escape. Cook on High for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Bread is done when a toothpick
  inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool the bread on a rack for 10
  minutes, then unmold. Serve warm. Makes 5 to 6 servings.

      Title: Cream Cheese Chicken
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish, Crockpot
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
-------------------------EILEEN LAMPARELLI  CGDR39A-------------------------
      1    Frying chicken; cut up
      2 tb Melted butter or margarine
           Salt and pepper
      2 tb Dry italian salad dressing
           Mix
      1 cn Condensed mushroom soup
      6 oz Cream cheese; cut into cubes
    1/2 c  Sauterne wine or sherry
      1 tb Chopped onion
 
  Brush chicken with butter and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place in a
  crockpot and sprinkle dry mix over all. Cover and cook on low for 6 to 7
  hours. About 45 minutes before done, mix soup, cream cheese, wine, and
  onion in a small saucepan. Cook until smooth. Pour over the chicken and
  cover and cook another 45 minutes. Serve with sauce.
  
  NOTE:  Hi, you know this sounds yummy and I know we all wish we could have
  it.  YOU CAN!  Just think logically. Cut your chicken up or use chicken
  parts but remember to remove all the skin and visible fat. Instead of using
  the butter or margarine, spray your chicken with one of the butter flavored
  non-stick cooking sprays. Use the low-fat, low-sodium cream of mushroom
  soup, and use the lite cream cheese, Neufchatel. You can use the wine as
  the alcohol will cook out and there isn't that much of it in this recipe,
  but even there you can substitute a light chablis for the sherry . Don't
  have a crockpot?  Try fixing the chicken in the oven. Just bake the chicken
  for about 45 minutes, then pour over the mushroom soup/wine mixture and
  continue baking for about 45 minutes. You must use your own judgement about
  covering the chicken, but I think you probably should to keep the chicken
  from drying out. Don't be afraid to try a recipe just because it looks like
  you can't have it. Just think logically! Have fun in the kitchen. (Trish)

  "Fighting with the croup? Don't forget the soup!" My dear friend Marilee
  Schabo writes for the Martin County Guide here in Florida and the above
  words headlined her column this week. She states that with cooler
  temperatures, post-Holiday letdowns and the flu season, her soup kettle is
  boiling.  Here are 3 of her recipes. Place all except frozen vegetables in
  crock pot. Turn on low and cover, cooking for 6 hours. One half hour before
  serving, turn up to high, add frozen veggies, stir and cover. NOTES: If you
  are in a hurry you can do this in 3 1/2 hours on high heat. Remove the
  bayleaf before serving.  You can add 1/2 cup of red wine with the
  vegetables for a more robust flavor. Taken from the Martin County Guide.

 Categories: Crockpot, Beef, Bbq
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 lb Brisket, rump, pot roast OR
      4 lb Boneless beef short ribs
      1    Onion; sliced
    1/2    Green pepper;, diced
      1 c  BBQ sauce (your favorite)
 
  Brown meat in heavy skillet. Put onion and pepper in bottom of the
  crockpot, placing the roast on top of vegs and then pour the sauce over
  meat. When doing short ribs, I layer the meat and veggies, then pour in the
  sauce. ADD NO ADDITIONAL LIQUID! Cover and cook on LOW for 8 - 10 hours
  (HIGH for 4 - 5 hours).  When meat is done, remove from pot with slotted
  spatula & place on a broiler pan. Pour some of the juices and sauce over
  meat and place under broiler for 5 - 10 mins. turning once. You can allow

      3 tb Parsley, minced
    1/4 c  Lentils, dried
 
  Soak white and pinto beans overnight. Saute onion, mushrooms and carrot in
  1 T of vegetable broth until tender. Add drained beans, vegetable bouillon,
  mustard and parsely, bring to bil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer 45
  minutes. Add split peas, lentils and barley. Cover and simmer another hour
  until all beans are tender. (Note: I like it spicy so I added lots of
  tabasco and pepper). I know this is more of a "winter recipe" but I think
  it will be good cold, also. Things got a bit mushy in the crockpot so it
  might be better to cook on the stove.

      Yield: 8 Servings

      2    Green peppers -- sliced thin
      2 tb Dried onions -- minced
      1 c  Beef broth
      2 tb Low sodium soy sauce
    1/2 ts Ground ginger
      1    Garlic clove -- minced
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
 
  * Use dried onions or finely chop about 1/2 of a fresh onion.
  
  1. Cut the steak into serving size pieces. If desired you can brown the
  meat in a little hot oil before adding to crockpot. Place the thinly sliced
  pepper rings in bottom of crockpot, reserving a few to place on top of meat
  if desired. (Vegetables cook better when placed on bottom of pot.) Arrange
  the meat on pepper, careful to not stack one piece directly on top of
  another. Mix all other ingredients and pour over meat and peppers. 2. Cover
  and cook on low for 8-10 hours or on high for about 4 hours. Serve with
  mashed potatoes and simply seasoned vegetables.

 Categories: Meats, Beef, Crockpot
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Beef brisket; choice size
           Bottle liquid smoke*
 
  Select a brisket the size you want for the number of people you are
  serving.  The best kind of liquid smoke to use is Colgin's. I can't get in
  in Indiana, and have to import it from Texas! Shake the desired amount of
  liquid smoke on the brisket.  I use about half a bottle for a large
  brisket.  Sometimes I add a clove or two of garlic, but not always, and not
  necessary. Cook on low for about 16 hours. I usually start this the evening
  before I want to serve it the next day--cook it all night, put in in the
  fridge until afternoon, and then return it to cooking for about 4 to 6 more
  hours that evening.   This long amount of cooking makes it nice and tender.
  Slice against grain. Serve with potato salad and baked beans. Yum! Yum Yum.
  I have also wrapped brisket in foil, and cooked it with liquid smoke in the
  oven for a long time--but crock pot is easier. A recipe of Judy Lausch
  DGSV43A.

           Seasoned flour
      1    Onion, thinly sliced
      4 oz Mushrooms, sliced
      1 cn 10 oz can, beef/oxtail
           -/tomato soup or
    1/2 pt Beef stock
           Salt and pepper
           Dried mixed herbs (opt)
           Oil or lard for frying
 
  Coat the meat with the flour.  Saute the onion in the oil and transfer to
  the slow cooker.  Brown the meat and place on top of the onions. Add the
  mushrooms and herbs, then pour over the soup or stock, and cook on High for
  4 - 5 hours or on Low for 8 - 10 hours.
  
  Any beef casserole can be adapted for the slow cooker, remembering that
  less liquid is needed than with conventional cooking, and the vegetables
  must be placed in the bottom of the crockpot with the meat on top. From:

      1 c  ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR
      1 c  SUGAR
    1/2 ts BAKING SODA
    1/4 ts GROUND CINNAMON (optional)
    1/3 c  BUTTER or MARGARINE
    1/4 c  WATER
      3 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
    1/4 c  BUTTERMILK
      1    EGG, beaten
    1/2 ts VANILLA EXTRACT
    1/4 c  WALNUTS, finely chopped
 
   Well grease two 1-pint straight-sided wide-mouth canning jars; line the
  bottom of each jar with waxed paper. Set aside.
  
   In a small bowl stir together flour, sugar, baking soda and cinnamon, if
  desired. Set aside.
  
   In a medium saucepan combine butter or margarine, water, and cocoa powder;
  heat and stir till margarine is melted and mixture is well blended. Remove
  from heat; stir in flour mixture. Add buttermilk, egg and vanilla; beat by
  hand until smooth. Stir in nuts.
  
   Pour mixture into the prepared canning jars. Cover the jars tightly with
  greased foil. (Place greased-side down on each jar).
  
   Place jars in a 3 1/2, 4, 5, or 6-quart crockery cooker with liner in
  place.  Cover; cook on high heat setting for 2-3/4 to 3 hours or until
  cakes spring back when touched and a long wooden toothpick inserted near
  the centers comes out clean. Remove jars from cooker; cool 10 minutes.
  Unmold cakes; remove waxed paper. Serve warm or cool with ice cream. Makes
  8 servings.
  
   WARNING: Use only CANNING JARS for this recipe. Others may not be tempered
  to withstand the heat. Do NOT use coffee or vegetable cans as most contain
  lead and are painted or sealed with materials that may give off toxic gases
  when heated.
  
   aken from "Better Homes and Gardens New Crockery Cooker"
  
   This recipe doesn't say you can seal them up and store them in your pantry
  but my Kerr Canning book recipe says you can; here's how:
  
   Remove jars from the oven one at a time, wipe rim of jar clean; put on lid
  and ring and screw on tightly.
   Jars will seal as the cake cools. Store like canned goods.
  
   If you'll be giving these as gifts, take a piece of decorative cloth
  (about 1-inch larger in circumference than the lid) and put it on top of
  the lid, then screw on the ring. Make sure you screw the lid on very
  tightly. I like to use pinking shears to cut the cloth out with. I've
  posted a recipe for baking the jars in the oven, it's posted on the Sweet
  Bread topic.

      Title: Crockpot Chili Verde
 Categories: Pork, New mexican, Crockpot
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Onion; coarsely chopped
      1    Bell pepper, green; coarsely
           -chopped
      4    Garlic clove; minced
      1 T  Olive oil
      4 oz Green chile, canned diced
      1    Jalape#o; diced (opt)
      7    Tomatillo
      2 lb Pork, lean; trimmed & cubed
      2 ts Oregano
      2 ts Sage
      1 ts Cumin
      1 ts Red pepper flakes
    1/2 c  Beer
 
  First, saute one onion and one green pepper, coarsely chopped, with three
  or four cloves of garlic, minced, in olive oil.  Throw into the crockpot.
  Also throw in a small can of diced green chiles.  Depending on your
  propensity for spicy food, you may add from one to three jalapenos, sliced.
  Then, throw some tomatillos in the pot.  How many? Well, when I got fresh
  ones in San Diego, I'd get seven or eight. Peel off the husk and coarsely
  chop.  Now that I've moved to Pittsburgh (don't ask me why), I've had to
  use canned ones on occasion. How many? Well, I don't really remember, it
  was one medium sized can, I think. Pay attention: I mean tomatillos, not
  green tomatoes. The Frugal Gourmet substituted celery and tomatoes. I
  haven't forgiven him yet.
  
  Take about 2 pounds of lean pork (I trim off all the excess fat I can),
  cubed, and brown in the pan that you sauteed the onion, etc. in. Into the
  pot.  Now, the seasoning mixture.  I prefer to grind up in my mortar
  oregano, some dried red chile peppers, sage, and cumin seed. Perhaps also
  some black pepper.  I almost never put salt in anything, so I probably
  wouldn't here either, but you may want to. How much? Well, about 2 tsp each
  of the oregano and the sage.  1 tsp each of the cumin seed and dried red
  peppers.  Salt and pepper to taste. I probably will add a dash of beer
  (about 1/2 cup) for obscure reasons.
  
  This crockpots all day, or could be simmered for probably about 2 hours.
  
  Traditionally, this is served in bowls, with hot flour tortillas, salsa,
  and cilantro.  You can also have sour cream, grated cheese, olives, and
  pickled carrots and jalapenos around.  Of course, you wrap all this up in
  the tortillas, making killer burritos.
  
  I throw one twist into this, a technique that comes from carnitas. After
  cooking, I separate the meat from the broth, crisp the meat under the
  broiler, and reduce the sauce in the pan.  This adds a great texture to the
  meat, and keeps the burritos from being too soggy. This is not what the
  original requester would want to do.

  combine flour, baking powder and pumpkin pie spice; set aside.
  
   In med. mixing bowl combine brown sugar and oil; beat till well combined.
  Beat in eggs. Add pumpkin; mix well. Add flour mixture. Beat just until
  combined. Stir in raisins.
  
   Pour pumpkin mixture into 2 well-greased and floured 1/2-pint
  straight-sided canning jars. Cover jars tightly w/greased foil. Place a
  piece of crumpled foil in 3-1/2 or 4 qt. crockery cooker with liner in
  place. Place jars atop crumpled foil.
  
   Cover; cook on high setting for 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hours or until a wooden
  toothpick inserted near centers comes out clean.
  
   Remove jars from cooker; cool 10 minutes in jars. Remove bread from jars.
  Cool thoroughly on wire rack.
   Makes 2 loaves.
  
   FOR 3-1/2 to 4 QUART CROCKPOTS--Halve all ingredients.
  
    WARNING: Use only CANNING JARS for this recipe. Others may not be
  tempered to withstand the heat.  Do NOT use coffee or vegetable cans as
  most contain lead and are painted or sealed with materials that may give
  off toxic gases when heated.
  
   This recipe doesn't say you can seal them up and store them in your pantry
  but my Kerr Canning book recipe says you can; here's how:
  
   Remove jars from the oven one at a time, wipe rim of jar clean; put on lid
  and ring and screw on tightly.
  
   Jars will seal as the cake cools.  Store like canned goods.
  
   If you'll be giving these as gifts, take a piece of decorative cloth
  (about 1-inch larger in circumference than the lid or as large as you'd
  like) and put it on top of the lid, then screw on the ring. Make sure you
  screw the lid on very tightly. I like to use pinking shears to cut the
  cloth out with. From: Millern@redwood.Cc.Andrews.Edu (N

      Title: Crockpot Rice Pudding with Fruit
 Categories: Crockpot, Desserts, Fruits
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    1/2 ga Milk; * see note
      1 c  Rice
      1 c  Sugar
      3 tb Margarine; solid
    1/4 ts Salt; optional
      1 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 c  Dried apricots or peaches; m
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
 
  Recipe by: Jo Anne Merrill Preparation Time: 3:00 * Use half nonfat and
  half whole milk, or all nonfat for lower fat content.
  
       Substitute canned milk for the regular milk for a very rich flavor.
  The cooking time will vary greatly, anywhere from 1-1/2 to 3-1/2 hours. The
  longer it cooks the thicker it will be.
       It is important to have the dried apricots minced. Put all ingredients
  into crockpot. Stir to blend well. Cover and cook on high 1- 1/2 hours,
  stir once after about 1 hour. Or, cook on high for the first 30 minutes,
  turn to low and cook as long as you desire. Check after the first 2 hours
  of low cooking and stir. If rice is not absorbing the milk quickly enough,
  turn the crockpot up to high again. Keep cover on at all times.
  
       Crockpot temperatures vary widely among different brands. Only
  experimentation can tell you the correct amount of time for cooking in your
  crockpot. Rarely will a crockpot recipe fail, though, as the long, slow
  cooking process does not require precise timing.

  1 1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Sage
      1 ts Thyme
    1/2 ts Pepper
    1/2 ts Marjoram
  3 1/2 c  Chicken or turkey broth
 
  Melt butter in a skillet and saute onion, celery, parsley, and mushrooms.
  Pour over bread cubes in a very large mixing bowl. Add all seasonings and
  toss well. Pour in enough broth to moisten. Add eggs and mix well. Pack
  lightly into Crockpot.  Cover and set to high for 45 minutes then reduce to
  low to cook for 4 to 8 hours. This recipe is from the Rival Crock Pot
  Cookbook.  I have enjoyed this many times at a friend's house. Using this
  recipe, I'll bet you can modify your own to work perfectly in the crockpot.
  Sure saves oven space in Thanksgiving! Posted 11/06/91

      Title: Crockpot Tips
 Categories: Crockpot, Information
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -Slow Pot Cookery 11/79
 
   1. Cookers should be at least half full to get best results
  
  2. Don't remove the cover for a 'look see' until at least one hour before
  the meal is supposed to be ready to eat as heat will escape when you lift
  the lid and the cooking time will be lenghtened as mush as 15-20 minutes
  
  3. It is not necessary to pre-brown any meats unless they are fatty. If
  neccessary ,bron you meat in a separate frying pan and pour off any excess
  fat before putting the meat in your pot.
  
  4. You'll probley end up with more liquid than when you started because
  almost nothing boils away in a slow cooker, and the foods you have been
  cookin will have given up some of there own natural juices. Sauces in the
  slow cooker will, therefore, tend to be on the thin side. To thicken them
  slightly (for gravies, etc.) laddle out the sauce into a saucepan, boil it
  down to reduce the liquid volume, add a little flour ( or your own heavy
  gravy recipe) and stir to prevent any burn on.
  
  5. Milk, cream, cheese, pasta, rice and fish usually cook in a short time.
  These types of ingredients should not be added to the cooker until shortly
  before you are ready to serve. Milk and cream can curdle durning long
  cooking periods and as far as timing for putting in cheese, rice, fish and
  the like this will generally be included in the recipe.
  
  6. Always try to use fresh vegetables when required. If you are forced to
  use frozen vegetable in any recipe,add them durning the last hour of
  cooking, otherwise they'll lose there bright colors ad taste overcooked.
  
  7. If your recipe calls for meat and vegetables cooked in a little liquid
  place the vegetables on the bottom. Postion doesn't matter all that much if
  your making a stew or chowder which calls for a large amount of liquid.
  
  8. The more liquid ( juice) the faster the cooking process will be.
  
  9. An extra hou on low doesn't mean that your dinner will be burned, but
  it may produce slightly mushier vegetables and softer meat.
  
  10. To vary time at differant settings, one hour on high is equal to 2 1/2
  hours on low.
  
  11. You may find that your family prefers a bit more
  seasonings with long cooking- salt, pepper, hot sauces, etc
  
  12. Spices tend to lose there purgency durning long cooking so either add
  whole spices and leaf herbs at the start, or if your using ground
  condiments add them durning the last hour of cooking time.

      Title: Crockpot Tips I
 Categories: Crockpot
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -JUDY GARNETT PJXG05A
 
    The crockpot is ideal for working people who must be away from home all
  day (or for those days when you must run errands or attend meetings, or for
  when you're entertaining and want to get the food preparation done early.)
  The food will simmer for 10 to 12 hours on Low if you must be gone all day
  or you may cook the food in 5 to 6 hours on High. If you are single, you
  can purchase a Crockpot as small as 1-quart size. It is a very simple
  appliance to operate and you will find that the cooked food is very tasty.
    If you a working person or one who knows they will have a very busy day,
  you can do most of the chopping and measuring the night before. Then
  refrigerate these ingredients until the next morning. If your crockpot has
  a REMOVABLE liner, you can assemble and refrigerate the food right in the
  liner which will be easy to pop in the crockpot the next a.m.
    Be sure you don't fill the crockpot so full that the food pushes up on
  the lid. The crockpot depends on the heat that builds up in the container
  itself. The lid must stay securely on the crockpot while it cooks. Resist
  the temptation to take a quick peek or stir frequently.
    Protect the crockery liner. Do not subject it to sudden temp. changes. Do
  not preheat the cooker and then add food. Do not pour cool water into the
  crockery liner while it is still hot after food has been removed.
    The crockpot is great for cooking less expensive cuts of meat such as
  beef chuck pot roasts, brisket, and pork shoulder roasts, because the long
  cooking at low heat tenderizes the meat. The low temp. also keeps the meat
  from shrinking as much as it does during other cooking methods. For recipes
  that call for small cuts of meat (especially recipes reduced to fit into 1
  quart cookers), keep your eyes peeled for specials at the meat counter.
  When meat is on sale, it's usually sold in lg. pieces. Buy these cuts and
  divide them into smaller portions. Wrap individually, label and freeze for
  later use. Also be on the lookout for packed smaller cuts of meat. If your
  store offers only lg. roasts, ask the butcher to cut a 1 to 1 1/2 lb. piece
  for you. Freezing chicken pieces before cooking in the crockpot slows
  cooking of the chicken and assures tenderness without overcooking when the
  rest of the foods are done. At least a day before CONTINUED IN NEXT NOTE

           -JUDY GARNETT PJXG05A
 
    As soon as possible, transfer any lefover food to a storage container and
  refrigerate or freeze.
    For extra covenience, use an automatic timer to start the cooker while
  you're away. However, the food should NOT stand more than 2 hours before
  the crockpot switches on. If using the timer, assemble the recipe and
  THOROUGHLY chill it. When time to leave the house, place chilled food in
  the crockpot. EXCEPTION: If the recipe calls for frozen chicken or fish, do
  NOT use an automatic timer! The standing time would give the forzen food a
  chance to thaw, resulting in overcooked fish or chicken.
    CLEANUP: As soon as you remove the food from the crockpot, uplug it and
  fill the liner with VERY HOT soapy water. (DO NOT ADD COOL WATER!!) Let the
  liner soak while you're eating. NEVER IMMERSE THE OUTSIDE PART OF THE
  COOKER OR LET THE CORD GET IN WATER!! Wipe the outside metal shell with a
  damp soft cloth and dry with a towel.
    MAKE AHEAD TIP: The night before, brown the meat, drain well, and wrap in
  foil. Clean and chop vegetables. Place vegetables, seasonings and liquids
  into a bowl (or liner, if removable) and chill overnight.
    Lifting meat loaf into and out of the crockpot is easy if you use foil
  "handles. Tear off 3 18x2-inch strips of HEAVY foil (or use reg. foil
  folded to double thickness). Criscross the foil strips in a spoke design on
  top of a large sheet of waxed papper. Shape the meat loaf in the center of
  the spoke. Lift the ends of the foil strips to transfter the meat loaf to
  the cooker. Leave strips under meat during cooking. The strips will enable
  you to remove the cooked meat without destroying its shape.
    Layer foods for best result. First, place vegetables in the bottom of the
  crockpot.Next sprinkle quick-cooking tapioca over the vegetables. The
  tapioca will thicken the juices as the meal cooks, making a delicious,
  ready-to-serve gravy. Finally, set the meat atop the vegetables and place
  the lid on the crockpot securely.
     For soup toppers, use crushed crackers, shredded cheese, toasted bread
  cubes or seasoned croutons, plain or cheese-flavored popcorn, shredded
  carrot, sour cream and snipped parsley or chives. For more elaborate
  toppers, cut shapes from toast with cookie cutters. (Fun to float on a
  soup.) For extra flavor, spread the toast with flavored butter, cheese
  spread or pesto before cutting. Freeze leftover foods in freezer containers
  with tight-fitting lids. Food expands when frozen. Leave 1/2" head room
  below rims of containers.You can also cool soup or broth in ice cube trays.

      Yield: 24 Servings
 
-------------------------------JONI'S KITCHEN-------------------------------
      4 lb To 6 lb Beef or pork or
           -a combination of both.
      2 pk Onion soup mix
      2    12 oz Bot's Chili Sauce
    1/2 c  Brown sugar:more or less
    1/4 c  Black molasses';about
      2 tb Worcestershire sauce;or less
      4 c  -water;to cover meat.
 
  In Crockpot on High, place cut up pieces of Beef and pork if you want to
  combine them, or just one or the other. I use what ever beef is on sale
  trim as much fat off as I can. Cut in large chunks put in Crock with 1 to 2
  packages of onion soup mix. I usually use a good 4 to 6 lb roast we like to
  freeze it. Use enough water to cover. You can add additional onions and
  celery to give it more flavor. And cook until fork tender. Remove from
  Crock, put meat on platter to cool, and save a couple of cups of the juice
  it was cooked in. Put into the crockpot the Chili Sauce, brown sugar,
  Molasses(optional) Worcestershire to taste. I do not like it too hot so I
  don't use more than a couple of tablespoons. Now take your meat on a board
  and start to shred it with a fork and paring knife, how ever it is easy for
  you, I don't like it to fine so do not use my processor. Just cut in pieces
  and shred, OK. Now put it back in crock and add enough of the juice it was
  cooked in, with the onions from the mix also, it adds to the flavor.Add
  just enough juice to make it moist, save some of the juice for as it cooks
  on simmer you may have to add some more. If you use for a cookout, you can
  keep it plugged in, and keep a check for moistness, when it gets a little
  dry just add some more juice. I use hamburger rolls. or bakery Hamburger
  rolls, or Kaiser rolls. What ever you prefer. It goes a long way. Left
  over's I put in little freezer bags or in the margarine containers,1/2 lb
  size, and freeze. Just enough for two sandwich's for lunch. This is from
  memory, so if you have a question or doubt<G> ask away. From Joni's Kitchen
  For Diabetics' I take a small portion and just add everything but the sugar
  and use Twin Brown sugar. Does very well.

 Categories: Breads, Crockpot
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
------------------------DEIDRE-ANNE PENROD--FGGT98B------------------------
    3/4 c  Walnut Meats
      1 c  Pitted Dates
    1/2 c  -All-Purpose Flour; sifted
      3 tb -Shortening
    3/4 c  -Boiling Water
      2    Eggs
      1 ts -Vanilla
      1 c  -Granulated Sugar
      2 tb -Dark Corn Syrup
      1 c  -All-Purpose Flour; sifted
  1 1/2 ts -Baking Soda
    1/2 ts -Salt
 
  Date Nut Bread 2 1/2 to 3 hours
  
  This is on the sweet side but awfully good. Children love it for breakfast
  or for afternoon snacks. Wrapped and refrigerated, it will keep fresh for
  several days, or you can freeze left-overs.
  
  To Cook:  Chop the walnut meats coarsely with a knife (the blender tends to
  make them into  mush).  Place the dates on a chopping board, sprinkle the
  1/2 cup of flour over them, and chop them. If you keep the dates well mixed
  with the flour, they won't stick to the knife as you work. Place the dates
  in a colander and shake the colander over the chopping board to remove as
  much flour as possible. Place the dates in a bowl, add the shortening and
  the boiling water, and let them stand as you prepare the batter. Beat the
  eggs well with a fork, add the vanilla, sugar, and corn syrup. Scoop all
  the flour from the chopping board and combine it with 1 cup of flour, the
  baking soda, and the salt. Beat the flour mixture into the eggs. Add the
  date mixture and beat just enough to blend all the ingredients. Fold in the
  nuts. Pour into a greased, floured, 1-quart mold. Cover with a loosely
  fitting plate. Set the mold on a trivet or rack in the slow cooker. Cover
  the cooker, but prop the lid open a fraction with a toothpick or a twist of
  foil to let excess steam escape. Cook on High for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Cool
  the bread on a rack for 10 minutes, then unmold. Serve warm. Makes 4 to 6
  servings. Source: "Clear & Simple Crockery Cooking", by Jacqueline

      Title: Diet Cream Soup Base
 Categories: Diabetic, Allergy, Soups, Crockpot, Low-fat/cal
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
           WHITE SAUCE
  3 1/2 tb Instant milk powder
  1 1/2 tb Cornstarch
  1 1/4 c  Cold water
           TOMATO
      8 oz Can tomato sauce
      3 tb Chopped onion
      1 pn Dry rosemary, crumbled
      1 pn Fresh ground pepper
      1 pn Cayenne pepper
 
  This recipe is suitable for anyone who needs to know the exact contents of
  soup. OTHER OPTIONS: Regular recipes use about 1 1/2 Tb butter and 1 1/2 Tb
  flour per cup of milk for a medium white sauce.
  
  5 oz evaporated milk plus 5 oz water plus 1 Tb corn starch
  
  1 cup soy milk plus 1 Tb corn starch
  
  1 cup skim milk plus 1 Tb vegetable oil plus 1 Tb corn starch
  
  Put ingredients in a blender and process at high speed until well blended,
  or put ingredients in a jar and shake, or stir dry ingredients into cold
  milk with a whisk.
  
  Stir constantly in the top of a double boiler until the sauce thickens and
  simmers, then cook ten minutes.  A medium saucepan set in a larger saucepan
  of simmering water works, too.
  
  Fresh tomatoes may be cooked with onion and seasoning, allowed to cool and
  pureed in a blender to make the sauce.  If the tomato mixture is colder,
  add a little of the hot white sauce to bring it to the same temperature.
  This prevents curdling when the red mixture is gradually added back into
  the pot with the white sauce.
  
  Heat soup until it is hot enough to serve but do not allow it to boil.
  
  The same method may be used with 3/4 to 1 cup of cooked diced (or pureed)
  vegetables with cooking liquid used to make the sauce.  Makes about 2 cups.
  Suggested vegetables:  potato with a little onion, carrot, zucchini,
  cabbage with a little ham, sauteed onion, mushroom, broccoli. Season to
  taste.

  pierced. (7 1/2-9 hrs).
  
  Carefully lift veal to a warm deep platter. Using a slotted spoon, lift
  carrots and mushrooms from cooker and arrange around veal; keep warm. In a
  small bowl, mix cornstarch and cream; blend into liquid in cooker. Increase
  cooker heat setting to high; cover and cook, stirring 2 or 3 times until
  sauce is thickened. (15-20 more minutes). Season with salt.

  Spoon some of the sauce over veal and vegetables; if desired, garnish with
  lemon peel and dill sprigs. Serve remaining sauce in a bowl or pitcher to
  add taste.

------------------------DEIDRE-ANNE PENROD--FGGT98B------------------------
      1 pk Pound Cake Mix; (16 oz)
    2/3 c  Orange Juice
      2    Whole Eggs
      3 tb Orange Rind; freshly grated
 
  Easy Orange Cake 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours
  
  This is very nice with an orange butter icing - sweet butter whipped with
  confectioners' sugar and orange juice concentrate to which has been added 1
  tablespoon of grated fresh orange rind.
  
   To Cook:  Place the cake mix, orange juice, and eggs in a large bowl and
  beat by hand 300 times. Add the grated rind for the last round of beating.
  Pour the batter into a well- greased-and floured 2-quart mold or
  spring-form pan. Place the pan in the slow cooker and cover with a loosely
  fitting plate. Cover the pot, but prop the lid open a fraction with a
  toothpick or a twist of foil to let excess steam escape. Cook on High for 2
  1/2 to 3 1/2 hours. When a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake
  comes out clean, the cake is done. Cool on a rack for 10 minutes before
  turning the cake out of the pan. Makes 10 to 12 servings.

      Title: Family Dinner Chicken Soup
 Categories: Soup, Poultry, Main dish, Crockpot
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -------------------------
  2 1/2 lb Chicken pieces
      1    Onion -- chopped
      3    Potatoes; peel -- dice
      4    Carrots sliced
      3    Stalks celery -- sliced
      3 T  Soy sauce
      1 t  Tabasco sauce
      1 t  Salt
  3 1/2 c  Water -- or to cover
 
  Combine all ingredients in large kettle. Cover and cook on low heat 2 ~ 3
  hours. Stir occasionally. Add water if necessary.
  
  Before serving, remove bones (this is dated 1926 - I think they were using
  stewing hens, which are much tougher that the friers we get now. I only
  cook this about 1 hour. The chicken should be tender enough to be falling
  off the bone. This can also be cooked on a Crockpot, on "low" about 10 - 12
  hours.
  
  It's from a Tabasco Sauce ad, dated 1926/1976 and it's as good as it
  sounds.

      Title: Favorite Baked Custard
 Categories: Crockpot, Desserts
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
           -June James GNDR31B
      2 c  Milk; scalded
      3    Eggs; slightly beaten
    1/3 c  Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/8 ts Salt
           Nutmeg or coconut
 
  Scald milk, let cool slightly.  Combine eggs, sugar, vanilla, and salt.
  Slowly stir in slightly cooled milk. Pour into buttered 1-qt baking dish.
   Sprinkle with nutmeg or coconut.  Cover with foil. Set baking dish on a
  trivet or meat rack in crock-pot. Pour hot water around baking dish, 1-inch
  deep.  Cover pot and cook on high for 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until knife
  inserted in custard comes out clean.  Serve warm or chilled. Makes 5 to 6
  servings.
  
  Tips that go with this dessert recipe.  Foil speeds cooking! You can
  decrease cooking times a bit by using a piece of aluminum foil on top of
  the contents or between the lid and the pot. The foil reflects heat back
  into the food, heat which would otherwise be lost through the lid. This
  trick can help speed up cooking in a cooker which cooks at lower
  temperatures (Almost a tongue twister!!!!).
  
  Tip #2:  A metal meat rack or metal trivet will keep a roast out of juices
  and fats in the bottom of the crock-pot and prevent the meat from sticking
  to the bottom. Use a meat rack only when the recipes say to, for it is not
  necessary or useful for all meat or dessert recipes. It is mot useful for
  fatty meats or roasts which produce a lot of grease while cooking!
  
  Tip #3:  Do not scrape or scratch crockery to remove stubborn food. Food
  will stick at the scratch later. Instead, fill the pot with water and let
  it soak. Also, keep kitchen utensils OUT of the pot when cleaning up. A
  knife or handful of silverware can scratch the cooking surface. If the
  glaze on the cooking surface should crack, get a new liner or crock-pot. A
  crack can trap food you can NEVER clean out. Bacterial could grow there!!!

      Title: Fran's Potato/cheese/corn Chowder
 Categories: Soups, Crockpot, Main dish
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter or margarine
      5 lb Potatoes
           -1 lb grated; 4 lbs diced
    3/4 c  Celery; diced
      1 c  Carrots; diced
      1 md Onion; minced
      2 lb Grated Cheese
      3 cn Creamed corn
      2 cn Whole corn (or frozen)
      1 lb Sliced sausage
      1 qt Chicken stock
      1 c  Powdered milk
           -NOT mixed up
      1 cn Cream of mushroom soup
      1 ts Black pepper
      1 tb Seasoned salt
      2 ts Basil
 
  This recipe is an adaptation of several of the potatoe chowder recipes that
  Lawrence Kellie posted a while back.  Some of the the ingredients also came
  from the top of my head.  It turned out VERY well, though it does look a
  little odd.  My husband LOVES it.  I finally came up with my idea of what
  Corn/potato chowder should be.  My 3-1/2 year old son's (vegetable hater)
  only comment as he shoveled it down was "yummy". I will definately be
  making this one again.  I am glad I wrote the changes down this time, I
  usually don't.
  
  This can either be cooked as direced in the recipe, or for about 10 hours
  in the crock pot, on HI, adding the milk powder and cheese at the end.
  
  In a large pot, melt butter over medium heat.   Saute onion and celery
  until softened but not brown. Add potatoes, Chicken broth, S&P, basil and
  carrots.  Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes until
  potatoes are just tender. Brown sliced sausage pieces in a fry pan, add to
  chowder.  Add cream of mushroom soup and corn. Simmer until potatoes and
  carrots are done to your desired level of mushiness ( I like em mushy in my
  chowder). Add grated cheese and milk powder. If the chowder is too thin,
  you can remove some of it and put throught the blender to thicken, if it is
  too thick, add water.  Adjust seasonings if desired. Serve with bread or
  crackers.

      5 lg Cloves garlic; chopped
      1 md Onion; chopped
      2 tb Olive oil
      2    28-oz cans tomato puree
      1    28-oz can crushed tomatoes
      1    28-oz can water
      1 c  Dry red wine (the secret)
      2 tb Sugar
      1 ts Basil (or 1 bunch fresh)
    1/2 ts (each) pepper, chervil,
           Parsley, and thyme
    1/4 ts (each) oregano, rosemary;
           -crushed
    1/2 ts Fennel seed; crushed
      2    Bay leaves

---------------------------------MEATBALLS---------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Lean ground beef
    1/2 c  Seasoned breadcrumbs
    1/2 ts (each) parsley and basil
           Garlic powder to taste
           Pepper to taste
    1/2 c  Romano/Parmesan cheese mix
      2    Eggs; beaten
    1/4 c  Milk
 
   This tomato sauce recipe is perfect for a crockpot becuase it does not
  impart that "burned" flavor when sauce is cooked on the stovetop. There is
  still a fresh tomato flavor even after many hours of cooking. Hope you like
  it.
   Saute garlic and onions in oil. Add all ingredients to a crockpot and cook
  on LOW 8 to 10 hours, stirring occasionally. Add meatballs the last hour,
  OR if using cubes of roast, or spareribs, or any other meat, add to
  crockpot at the beginning.
   Mix meatball ingredients well and form into medium-size balls. Adjust
  consistency with milk if necessary. Add to crockpot the last hour.

      Title: Hampton's Turkey Chili
 Categories: Chili, Ground turk, Crockpot
      Yield: 6 To 8 servn
 
      1 tb Chili powder
      1 ts Ground oregano
      1 ts Ground basil
    1/2 ts Red pepper flakes, crushed
      1 tb Ground cumin
      2    Bay leaves
      1 tb Paprika
      2 lb Ground turkey
      1    Onion, chopped
    1/4 c  Worcestershire sauce
    1/4 c  Dry red wine
      2 cl Garlic, mashed
      1 cn (8 oz) can tomato puree
      8 oz Catsup
 
  :         Salt
  :         Chopped onion
  :         Grated cheddar cheese
  
  Combine chili powder, oregano, basil, red pepper, cumin, bay leaves and
  paprika.  Add to the ground turkey and mix well. Combine turkey mixture
  with onion. Place in large saucepan.
  
  Add Worcestershire and red wine.  Cover and cook over medium heat 1 1/2
  hour, stirring often.  Add garlic and stir well. Add tomato puree and
  catsup and mix well. Season to taste with salt. Cook over low heat 20-30
  minutes, stirring occasionally.  Serve hot with chopped onion and grated
  Cheddar cheese.  Makes 6-8 servings.
  
  NOTE:   My notes indicate that I used one 6 oz. can of tomato paste and 2
  oz. of tomato juice instead of the 8 oz. of tomato puree. This makes a very
  thick chili. If you wish to make it thinner, add more tomato juice. ~End

      Title: Indian Pudding #1
 Categories: Desserts, Crockpot
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
------------------------DEIDRE-ANNE PENROD--FGGT98B------------------------
  3 1/2 c  Whole Milk; cold
    1/3 c  Yellow Cornmeal
      2    Eggs
    1/4 c  -Dark Molasses
    1/2 c  -Light Brown Sugar; firmly
           -packed
    1/2 ts -Salt
    1/2 ts -Ground Ginger

      4 tb Butter
    3/4 c  Golden Seedles Raisins
    1/2 pt Light OR Heavy Cream
 
  Indian Pudding 2 to 3 hours
  
  The slow cooker does this spicy cornmeal dessert beautifully. You can make
  it with half-and-half instead of milk if you want a rich pudding.
  
  To Cook: Over medium heat in a large saucepan, heat 3 cups of the milk.
  Combine the 1/2 cup cold milk with the cornmeal and turn into the saucepan.
  Stir continuously until the mixture begins to thicken. Lower the heat and
  stir 20 minutes more. Beat the eggs in a small bowl and stir in the
  molasses, sugar, salt, ginger, and cinnamon. Cut the butter into the
  cornmeal mixture and stir in the raisins. Add the egg mixture and whip
  briskly, then pour into a buttered 2-quart mold. Pour 2 cups of water into
  the slow cooker, place the mold on a rack or trivet in the cooker, cover
  the pot, and cook on High for 2 to 3 hours. Serve warm with cream. Makes 8
  servings.

      Title: Introduction To Baking in Crock-Pots #1
 Categories: Desserts, Crockpot
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
------------------------DEIDRE-ANNE PENROD--FGGT98B------------------------
 
  Baking in a Slow Cooker As mentioned before, under some circumstances (when
  it is cooking stews and casseroles and braising meats, for instance) a slow
  cooker acts as a Dutch oven. But at other times it can be like a small real
  oven or a steamer. Because it uses up so few energy-pennies a day, it is
  economical to use for baking small quantities, Baking in an oven, unless
  you really need lots of space, heats a large area when a smaller one would
  do. If things baked in your slow cooker don't come out just right the first
  time, experiment a little, and eventually you'll turn out surprisingly
  handsome baked goods. Test one or two recipes here in your baking equipment
  ~ you may want to halve some of the recipes. To do much baking in a slow
  cooker, you must have one of the larger units. The low, small units can't
  handle much. But it is fun to try half recipes in them, and all the other
  recipes in this section can be halved and cooked in smaller units.
   One of the manufacturers - notably Rival - are marketing baking units that
  fit inside slow cookers. If your slow cooker isn't equipped with a baking
  utensil, you can easily improvise. Study the commercial baking units
  offered, and you'll see they are tall so that doughs can rise high. They
  are lidded to keep the steam, which forms inside the cover of the slow
  cooker, from falling back into the batter or dough. Below the lid, there
  are vents in the sides of the container so that steam from the cooking
  batter can escape into the slow pot. A cover to keep steam from falling
  into the batter and venting to let steam out of the cooking utensil are the
  essential elements in baking improvisations. A two-pound coffee can is a
  good substitute. Muffin tins don't fit slow cookers. However, Pyrex muffin
  cups do.  I make a double-decker layer of them, using Pyrex cups or a plate
  to cover the bottom layer and a piece of foil to keep steam from the top
  layer.  About 6 Pyrex muffin cups, each 2 1/2 inches across, fit several of
  the slow- cooker models on the market--making half the average recipe. (If
  you have mixed up a batch of ingredients and find it doesn't fit the
  intended baking equipment, cook in a mold. Custards cook beautifully in a
  souffle dish or casserole. Use a 1 1/2 quart size, topped with a loosely
  placed foil lid to keep condensing steam from falling into custard. Also
  use a Pyrex cup as a rack on the floor of the slow-cooker; and crumpled
  foil pressed over the upended bottom of the Pyrex cup stabilizes the
  casserole resting on top.) One thing you'll find helpful for baking is a
  trivet or a metal rack. If your cooker doesn't come equipped with one,
  measure the cooker's diameter and buy one, or use a Pyrex cup, as explained
  above. In my experience, breads and cakes are more successful when they sit
  a little above the floor of the slow cooker than when they sit right on it.

  About Baking Recipes When you are baking in a slow cooker, prepare the
  dough or batter as you would when cooking in conventional utensils; then
  pour the batter or place the dough in a container the right size to fit
  inside your slow cooker. The large cookers will take 1-, 1 1/2-, and 2- or
  3-quart molds. The molds' high sides are important. The dough or batter
  needs space to rise under a cover. Since molds don't come equipped with
  covers or lids, use a plate or piece of foil to cover the mold and to keep
  steam from dampening the dough. A mold can sit on a Pyrex cup if you have
  no trivet. Some doughs and batters don't need to be protected from the
  steam - for instance, Plum Pudding is steamed rather than baked. Other
  batters are dense enough to take all the steam likely to fall on them
  without harm. But other batters, such as Pound Cake, should be kept away
  from steam. Moist cakes and tea breads come out very well in the slow
  cooker. And you'll find it is fun to experiment with making homemade breads
  of all sorts from scratch. Among the recipes that follow are some basic
  combinations. Use these to adapt your own favorite recipes for fruit
  breads, yeast breads, and buns.
  
  Using the Timer for Baking While some baked goods turn out well cooked on
  Low, many of the recipes call for cooking on High for just a few hours (not
  8 to 10 hours!). Mix your batter and use a timer to start the slow pot
  going in your absence. That lets you leave whenever you like and come back
  to the aroma of ready- to-eat muffins or cake. If you delay baking goods
  containing baking powder and baking soda, they may end up flatter than they
  should be. This may be because the baking powder or baking soda warmed up
  as soon as the ingredients were mixed and had lost its rising power by the
  time baking began. Keep all the ingredients cooled when you time your
  baking to start several hours after the batter has been mixed. If the
  recipes call for water in the slow cooker before baking starts, add an
  equivalent of ice cubes for timer-started baking. You won't get the kind of
  richly browned tops on goods baked in slow cookers that you get in an oven.
  Icing or glaze will mask that for party occasions. But in truth it's such a
  treat to have comfort foods without seeing the cook slaving over the stove
  for an hour before it is served that no one will mind much.
  
  Don't Lift the Lid During Baking During the early part of the baking, don't
  lift the lid. You will let out heat and delay the baking process. When the
  baked goods are almost done, lift the lid and test quickly for doneness by
  inserting a toothpick in the center of the cake or bread.
  
  Puddings, Custards, and Compotes Some other breakfast foods from
  Grandmother's day are stewed dried fruits such as prunes, raisins, and
  apricots. These (as well as fresh fruits) can be cooked overnight in the
  cooker and be ready to eat when you get up. Or they can be cooked overnight
  and chilled all day, to provide economical and richly nutritious desserts
  for dinner. In many areas, electrical rates are lower at night than during
  the day. In these areas, overnight cooking has a double appeal: you rise to
  a delicious breakfast at half the price! Custards and puddings respond
  beautifully to the slow, gentle heat of the slow cooker. Some require
  covering to keep steam from the ingredients. I've included two basic rice
  pudding recipes that will give you an idea of what the cooker can do in
  this area. Caramel Custard - one of the world's favorite desserts - also
  turns out well in a slow cooker.

      4    Lamb shanks (3-4 lbs total)
           - bones cracked
      1 lg Onion, finely chopped
      1    Cinnamon stick (2"long)
  1 1/2 ts Ground coriander
      1 ts Ground ginger
    1/2 ts Ground cumin
    1/4 ts Ground allspice
  1 1/4 c  Chicken broth
    1/4 c  Apricot or orange muscat
           - dessert wine
    3/4 c  Coarsely chop dried apricots
  1 1/2 c  Couscous
           Mint sprigs (optional)
 
  Place lamb shanks in a single layer in a shallow baking pan. Bake in a 450
  oven until well browned (20-25 minutes). Meanwhile, in a 4 quart or larger
  electric slow cooker, combine onion, cinnamon stick, coriander, ginger,
  cumin and all spice.  Lift lamb from baking pan and place on top of onion
  mixture; discard fat in pan. Pour broth over lamb. Cover and cook at low
  setting until lamb is so tender it pulls away from bones when prodded with
  a fork (7 1/2-9 hrs.)
  
  Lift lamb to a warm, deep platter and keep warm. Skim and discard fat from
  cooking liquid; then measure liquid. You need 2 1/4 cups; if necessary,
  pour off some of the liquid or add enough hot water to make 2 1/4 cups.
  Return liquid to cooker and increase heat setting to high. Stir in wine and
  apricots, then couscous. Cover and let stand until liquid has been absorbed
  (about 10 more minutes.) Spoon couscous around lamb; garnish with mint, if
  desired.
  
  "Fragrant apricot wine echoes the sweet-tart tang of dried apricots in a
  fluffy couscous to serve with spicy braised lamb shanks. To bring all the
  flavors together, steam the couscous in the liquid that remains in the
  cooker after the meat is done." Source: Sunset Crockpot CB

  ** use about 4 tab. of the paste and add it about 45 minutes to 1 hour
  before serving the beans. *uncooked and sliced to thickness you like Put
  beans in crockpot and add water to cover plus 1 cup or the amount you would
  want for juice. Let beans cook till they start to soften then add
  everything but the adobo and let cook till done. Add salt and pepper to
  taste. I sometimes--> 1- cup of beef broth instead of the water as i like
  the richer flavor. If using the broth I'm careful adding salt. We serve
  with fat slices of buttered french bread and pour the beans and juice on
  top of it. A green salad and that's it. Hope you will enjoy the beans.

    1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Dry mustard
      1    -2 teaspoons fresh garlic
           -root, minced
      1    -2 teaspoons fresh garlic,
           -minced
      2 ts Shoyu, (soy sauce)
      1    10 oz pkg frozen broccoli
           -flowerets, thawed, optional
      2 tb Cornstarch MIXED WITH
    1/4 c  Water
           Cooked rice
 
  * I use homemade chicken stock, but 1 can of chicken broth works well when
  you don't have any homemade stock at hand. Put the frozen chicken in the
  crockpot right out of the freezer. Whisk all other ingredients (except
  cooked rice, broccoli, cornstarch and water) together and pour over the
  chicken. Turn the crockpot on low and cook for four to five hours. If you
  desire, you may top with one 10 ounce package of frozen broccoli flowerets
  about one hour before the chicken is finished. Before serving, remove the
  chicken and broccoli and stir in the cornstarch mixture. Put crockpot on
  high until the broth bubbles and thickens. Turn crockpot off. Fix a pot of
  rice (or pasta) and you have a very easy, delicious meal. NOTE If you don't
  have fresh ginger root and garlic, you can substitute Gilroy's garlic and
  ginger blend. Me ke aloha, Mary NOTES

  blade of a More(Y/n/=3D)? heavy knife until pureed. Saute onions in olive
  oil; when onions clear, add garlic puree.  Stir quickly (less than a
  minute) to avoid onions browning.  Remove sauteed onions and garlic from

  and stir.  Cook eight hours on low, four hours on high. OPTIONAL: Best
  cooled and re-heated.  Garnish with grated sharp Cheddar cheese and sliced
  green onions; serve with corn chips. To use dried instead of canned beans,
  soak two and two-thirds cups (one pound) pinto or kidney beans overnight in
  three times their volume of water. Add salt to the water the next morning,
  and slowly bring to a boil. Boil ten minutes, cover, and let simmer for two
  hours until beans are tender. Drain before using in recipe. Family Circle

 Categories: Crockpot, Pot roast, Beef, Pork
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           -KRISTINA BANES
      1    Roast (beef or pork)
           -(3 to 4 lbs.)
           Lemon juice
           Worcestershire sauce
           Garlic powder
           Black pepper
           Parsley
           Dill weed
      1 lg Onion; chopped
      6    Carrots; peeled
           -and cut into big sticks
 
  Place a small ovenproof plate upside-down in the bottom of your crockpot,
  or use a small meat rack which fits the crockpot. Place roast on top and
  rub a good amount of lemon juice into top and sides of meat. Do the same
  with the Worcestershire sauce. Sprinkle garlic powder, parsley, black
  pepper, and dill weed on top. Use the spices to taste. (I use lots of
  garlic, less pepper and parsley, and just a pinch of dill.) Carefully turn
  the roast over and repeat. Place covered crockpot in your fridge overnight
  to marinate. Next morning, turn on to LOW. As it warms up, fill the pot
  with water just to the bottom of the roast. Arrange veggies around the meat
  and re-cover.  Cook all day at LOW, draining off some of the fatty liquid
  about 2/3 of the way through, refrigerating it to harden the fat. Remove
  the hardened fat and discard. Use the reserved liquid and the juice in the
  pot to make gravy with cornstarch, water, and McCormick brown gravy mix.
  You can also put in potatoes with the roast, cook them separately, or serve
  the meat and gravy with rice. NOTE: The poster of this recipe reported that
  she received this recipe from her Mother-in-Law, and that it was her
  husband's favorite.

      Title: North Carolina Chopped Barbecued Pork
 Categories: Crockpot, Main dish, Pork, Sandwich
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Pork shoulder roast
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Celery seed
   1/16 ts Cinnamon, ground
   3/16 c  Vinegar, cider
    1/4 c  Catsup
    1/4 ts Chili powder
    1/4 ts Nutmeg, ground
    1/4 ts Sugar
    1/2 c  Water
           Vinegar, cider; to taste
           Sauce, Tabasco; to taste
 
  Brown roast in a small amount of fat and place in a Dutch oven. Mix the
  next 9 ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Pour over roast and
  cover.  Bake in a preheated 325^ oven, 40 minutes to the pound, until done,
  basting occasionally with drippings.
  
  Transfer roast to a chopping board.  Remove meat from the bone and chop
  into fairly fine pieces. Season to taste with additional vinegar and hot
  sauce.  Serve hot with coleslaw and corn bread.
  
  Sylvia's comments: I found some stew pork marked WAY down, bought several
  packages ($.99/lb!) and stuck them in the freezer.  Then I put all the
  ingredients, including the still-frozen pork, in the crockpot this morning.
  Tonight it was done, I just mashed up the meat with a fork and knife and
  served it over rice.  The vinegar produces a very interesting taste.
  However, it came out kind of soupy; next time I'll leave out the water and
  increase the catsup.
  
  This is the most popular barbecue dish in North Carolina, and, as far as we
  know, it is indigenous to that state.

      3 lb Fresh Beef Brisket;
           -(I use English Cut Roast)
    1/2 ts Garlic Salt
    1/2 ts Celery Salt
    1/2 ts Onion Powder
    1/4 c  Liquid Smoke
      1 cn Tomato Paste (6 oz.)
      1 c  -Water
      1 c  Barbecue Sauce
    1/4 c  Brown Sugar (packed)
    1/2 ts Salt
 
   Rub both sides of beef with garlic salt, celery salt and onion powder. Put
  in baking dish and pour liquid smoke on both sides. Cover tightly;
  refrigerate overnight, In the morning, combine the remaining ingredients in
  crockpot.  Add beef; cover.  Cook 8-10 hours on LOW.
   NOTE: I have found the cook time is not accurate to go by. It takes me
  longer to get it done. I usually put it on to cook overnight on LOW and
  continue cook on LOW through the day until done. You might want to
  experiment. When done, the roast literally falls apart. Serve it on buns.
  Add chips and a fresh fruit salad and you're all set.

      Title: Paupiettes De Boeuf  Mwmv49a
 Categories: Crockpot, Beef, Main dish
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter, margarine
      2    Onions, medium; peeled and
           Minced finely
    1/2 lb Mushrooms; fresh, minced
      1 tb Lemon rind; grated
      2 tb Bread crumbs; unflavored
    1/2 c  Parsley; fresh, minced
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
      2    Eggs; slightly beaten
      1 lb Bottom round of beef; cut
           Into 16 thin slices, each
           4 inches square
           Salt,pepper,thyme-grnd,flour
      4 tb Butter or margarine
      1 c  Water, warm
      2    Garlic cloves; medium,
           Peeled and crushed
      2 tb Mustard;White Dijon,prepared
 
  To Cook: In a heavy skillet, over medium-low heat, melt 2 tablespoons of
  butter and saute the onion and mushrooms until the onion is translucent.
  Stir in the lemon rind, bread crumbs, parsley, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4
  teaspoon pepper. When the parsley has wilted ~ about 1 minute after you add
  it to the skillet - quickly stir in the eggs to bind the mixture and remove
  skillet from the heat at once. Set aside. With a rolling pin or a wooden
  mallet, flatten the beef pieces until each is very thin and about twice its
  original size. As you finish each piece, season it with a little salt,
  pepper, and a pinch of thyme. At the widest end of each beef slice, place 1
  teaspoon of bread-crumb mixture from the skillet. Roll up the meat,
  sausage-shape, and secure it with a wooden toothpick through the center.
  Roll each piece in flour. In a very large skillet, over medium- high heat,
  melt 4 tablespoons of butter and brown the
  :        07/02/92        8:45 AM pieces of beef. As you finish, place them
  in the slow-cooker. Pour the water into the skillet; scrape up the pan
  juices and turn the sauce into the cooker. Cover and cook on Low for about
  5 hours. Before serving: About half an hour before serving, mix the garlic
  and mustard into the sauce around the beef; cover; turn the heat to High,
  and cook for 30 minutes. If the sauce seems less flavorful than you like,
  about 5 minutes before serving add a dab of prepared mustard and a little
  salt. If the sauce seems thin, leave the cover off during the second
  cooking period. Source: Jacqueline Heriteau, THE BEST OF ELECTRIC CROCKERY

      Title: Peanut Stuffed Chicken Breast
 Categories: Poultry, Microwave, Crockpot
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     12    Chicken breasts, boned
    1/2 c  Peanut butter
    1/8 c  Honey
      1 ts Cumin
      1 tb Mint, dried
      1 pk G. Washington's Golden
           -bouillon mix
 
  Bone chicken breasts if needed, keeping meat as nearly intact as possible.
  (It's much easier to rip the meat off the bones than any knifework I've
  tried to date.)  Pull off shreds and gobbets.
  
  Put peanut butter, honey, cumin and mint in a bowl and mix well.
  Microwaving for 30 seconds or so thins it and makes it much easier to mix.
  
  Spread about 2 tsp of the peanut butter mix in a thin layer over each piece
  of breast meat.  Place 1/12 of the shreds and gobbets on the breast and
  roll them up into a packet.  Tie the packet shut with butcher's twine or
  fasten with a toothpick.
  
  Arrange the twelve packets in layers in the crock pot, being careful not to
  let any fall open.
  
  Stir water in to the bowl with any remaining peanut butter and mix well.
  Add the packet of bouillon and pour over the chicken packets. Add water as
  needed to cover packets to a depth of at least one inch. Turn crock pot on
  high for 5 or 6 hours.
  
  Remove packets from pot and let drain on a platter.
  
  All the chicken fat will have migrated to the top of the liquid, which I
  suspect would probably make a wonderful flavoring for soups and other
  dishes. Source: Unknown From: Dorie Villarreal Date: Thu, 01-0

      Title: Pineapple Pound Cake
 Categories: Cakes, Crockpot
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
------------------------DEIDRE-ANNE PENROD--FGGT98B------------------------
      1 pk Pound Cake Mix; (16 oz)
    2/3 c  Pineapple Juice; drained
           -from a 16-oz can of pine-
           -apple tidbits
      2    Whole Eggs
  1 1/2 c  Pineapple Tidbits
      3 tb -All-Purpose Flour
 
  Pineapple Pound Cake 2 1/2 to 3 hours
  
  To Cook: Turn the cake mix, pineapple juice, and eggs into a large mixing
  bowl and beat with an electric beater on low. In a small bowl, combine the
  drained pineapple tidbits with the flour. Toss them well in the flour so
  that any moisture left over on the tidbits is absorbed. Fold the tidbits
  into the batter. Pour the batter into a greased and floured 2- quart mold
  or spring-form pan. Place the pan in the slow cooker and cover with a
  loosely fitting plate. Cover the pot, but prop the lid open a fraction with
  a toothpick or a twist of foil to let excess steam escape. Cook on High for
  2 1/2 to 3 hours. When a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes
  out clean, the cake is done. Cool the cake on a rack for 10 or 15 minutes
  before you turn it out of the pan. Let it cool thoroughly before serving.
  Makes 10 to 12 servings.

  This recipe  is a descendant of Ruth Macguire's great- grandmother's plum
  pudding - a traditional Christmas dinner dessert. It is flambeed with rum
  and served with a hard sauce on the side. Ruth makes it several weeks
  before Christmas and lets it ripen in a cool, dark closet, well wrapped in
  several thicknesses of cheesecloth soaked in rum and overwrapped with foil.
  
  :    To Cook:  Sift the flour, salt, baking powder, allspice, ginger, and
  nutmeg into a very large bowl. Stir in the remaining ingredients one at a
  time until all are added. Grease a 2-quart pudding mold or a regular mold
  and pour mixture in.  Cover with a square of clean linen and tie down the
  linen with string. Place on a trivet in a slow cooker and add 2 cups of
  water. Cover and cook on High for 5 to 6 hours. Makes 10 to 12 servings.

 Categories: Crockpot, Chicken, Make ahead
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           -EILEEN LAMPARELLI
      1    Broiler-fryer (3 lbs.)
      1    Piece of celery (2")
      1    Carrot
    1/2    Onion
      1 c  Chicken broth
      1    Bay leaf
           Salt and pepper; to taste
 
  Wash the chicken and pat dry. Place it in the crockpot. season with salt
  and pepper. Place the celery, carrot and onion around the chicken. Pour in
  the broth. Add the bay leaf. Cover and cook on LOW for 7 to 8 hours or till
  the chicken is tender. Lift the chicken from the pot and let it cool until
  it is cool enough to handle. Now remove the meat from the chicken and
  freeze what you're not going to eat that night. You can also strain the
  stock and refrigerate it. Chill overnight and skim off the fat. Now you
  will also have delicious chicken broth and can use some of the chicken
  mixed with the broth for soup.  One chicken will give him about 2-1/2 to 3
  C of chicken meat and about 1 C of stock. This starts you off with an easy
  chicken recipe. I'm sure your dad won't eat 3 lbs. of chicken at one
  sitting, but the beauty of this dish is that the chicken is so versatile!
  He can freeze the leftover chicken and use it for a chicken salad, sandwich
  or just as it is! If you get him a 4 1/2 qt. crockpot, it will accommodate
  two whole 3 lb. chickens and just think of all the leftovers he'll have to
  freeze then!!

      Title: Pot Roast
 Categories: Crockpot, Beef, Pot roast
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           -ELLIE COLLIN
      3 lb 7 bone beef roast
      1 pk Beefy onion dry soup mix
      2 ts Kitchen Bouquet; (Brown
           -sauce)
      2    Celery stalks; chunked
      1    Baby carrots; small bag
      6 sm Red potatoes; halved
      1 lg Onion; sliced
           Freshly Ground black pepper
           -to taste
 
  Saute the onion,celery and carrots in a little oil in a large skillet intil
  everthing's a little brown. Remove theveggies; set aside. Using the same
  skillet, brown the roast on all sides. remove the roast and place it into a
  large crock pot, along with the sauteed veggies. Deglaze the pan with a
  little water (or wine), scraping up all the browned bits of meat and veggie
  residue. Pour the juices into the crockpot and cover the roast with water
  (about 1 inch higher than the roast). I know, most crockpots say NOT to add
  too much water but I want leftover juices to make gravy later on in the
  week--This makes LOTS of GOOD gravy juice. Cook the roast on LOQ for 8 to
  10 hours. Once the meat and veggies are done, remove them from the crockpot
  to your serving platter. Skim the fat from the juices or use a fat-skimming
  cup to remove it. I only use as much of the broth as I need to make gravy
  for that meal. I thicken it with arrowroot and water. I divide the rest of
  the cooking juices and place it into containers (unthickened) and freeze it
  so I can make gravy anytime I want (meatloaf, etc). Don't be afraid to make
  that much broth at once, trust me, it's very flavorful, and it won't sog up
  the roast one bit.

      Title: Pot Roast  (Gkdr92a)
 Categories: Crockpot, Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Roast
      6    Potato; halved (no need to
      3    Onion; peeled and quartered
      4    Carrots; cut into 2" length
    1/2 c  Water
 
  I, too, love knowing that my dinner is already cooking ~ even on days that
  I don't work (outside the home, that is!). I have fallen into the trap of
  making two recipes over and over. One or the other is always simmering when
  out-of-town guests are expected.  (My husband's family is notorious for
  showing up later than expected. Crock pot meals are fabulous for times when
  you don't know when dinner will be served!) Put the veggies on the bottom
  and the meat on top. Season meat with salt and pepper. Pour water over all.
  Simmer all of the above on low all day. Sometimes I add an envelope of
  onion soup mix or a small can of whole tomatoes for a variation. The meat
  falls apart and is wonderful! FROM: BARBARA NIXON (GKDR92A)

  a pound of butter - which makes it really expensive today. The mix works
  beautifully, and costs lots less. It freezes beautifully. To Cook: Turn the
  cake mix, water, and eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat by hand 300
  times. Do it by hand - this give it a more from-scratch texture. Pour the
  batter into a greased and floured 2-quart mold or a spring-form pan. Set
  the pan in the slow cooker and cover the top with a loosely fitting plate.
  Cover the pot, but prop the lid open a fraction with a toothpick or a twist
  of foil to let excess steam escape. Cook on High for 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours.
  When a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, the cake is
  finished. Cool the cake on a rack for 10 minutes before you turn it out of
  the pan. Makes 8 servings.

      2    Onions; peeled and sliced
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper
    1/2 c  Beef broth; or water
 
  Brown meat in a skillet.  Meanwhile, put vegetables in bottom of the
  crockpot. Salt & pepper the meat after browning and then put on top of
  veggies in pot. Add liquid. Cover and cook on LOW for 10 - 12 hours (HIGH 5
  ~ 6 hours). Remove meat and veggies with slotted spoon or spatula and
  thicken juices for gravy. Prepare a smooth paste of 1/2 c. flour and 1/2 c.
  water. Pour it into the juices in the pot, stirring well. Turn pot on HIGH;
  when it comes to a boil, stir well and it is ready. May take about 15 mins.
  for juice to come to a boil. This is just enough time for your roast to
  'rest' before slicing. TO MAKE THE ROAST WITHOUT THE VEGGIES, Lightly flour
  and season the meat with salt and pepper. Brown in a heavy skillet. Place
  in crockpot with a packet of onion soup mix or beefy mushroom soup mix,
  adding 1/2 c. water when soup mix is used, or add 1 can Campbells French
  Onion Soup or Beefy Mushroom Soup or Golden Mushroom Soup or Creamy Onion
  Soup, adding just 1/4 c. water with the canned soups. Cover roast and cook
  on LOW for 10 hours, or on HIGH for 5 - 6 hours. Make gravy as directed for

  Mix the jam, dressing, soup mix, and water together, pour over the chicken,
  and bake until done. So easy, so good. I usually buy 2 small jars of jam -
  1 large bottle of dressing and slice up some 'real' onion to add just a
  little cause we eat a lot of chicken. Give it a go. IF YOU'RE A CROCKPOT
  COOKER, mix,leave and return to eat. I usually buy bone-less legs due to
  cost. But sometimes you can get a nice large bag of boneless chicken breast
  at a reasonable price. Bake at 350 degrees for about an hour or so.

 Categories: Breads, Crockpot
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
------------------------DEIDRE-ANNE PENROD--FGGT98B------------------------
  1 1/2 c  -All-Purpose Flour; sifted
  1 1/4 ts -Baking Powder
    1/4 ts -Baking Soda
    1/2 ts -Salt
  1 1/2 tb -Granulated Sugar
      1 ts -Caraway Seeds
    1/2 c  -Seedless Raisins
      2 ts -Shortening
      1    Egg; slightly beaten
      1 c  Buttermilk
 
  Ruth Macguire's Soda Bread 2 hours
  
  This soda bread recipe came to Ruth from an Irish friend via Brooklyn, but
  it is authentically Irish. You can glaze it with a runny mixture of sugar
  and milk set to firm up and dry in a low oven - 350^F. Irish restaurants in
  New York always offer warm soda bread with dinner, but they don't glaze it.
  
  To Cook:  Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar into
  a large bowl. Add the caraway seeds and raisins. Working with your fingers,
  rub the shortening into the flour mixture. Or with two knives, cut it into
  the flour until it makes a coarse mealy mixture. Add the egg and buttermilk
  and stir until you have formed a soft dough. Flour a board and turn the
  batter out onto it. Knead the dough lightly for one minute. Form a round
  loaf and make a shallow cross in the center. Place the dough in a well-
  floured 2-quart mold and cover loosely with a plate. Cover the cooker and
  bake on High for about 2 hours, or until the bread is crusty on top and a
  toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Makes 4 to 6 servings.

      1    Sausage and Peppers
 
  RE: Crock pot recipes
  
  DC>I am not the most creative person in the world when it comes to using my
  crock pot.  Do any of you have favorite recipes you could post for me?
  
  Here are a couple of things that I make in mine.  I don't have exact
  measurements though, because these are just things I thought up myself.
  
  Brown italian sausage (I usually get about two pounds) in skillet or put
  under
  
  broiler just till browned.  Drain off fat and let cool just till you can
  handle them. Meanwhile they are browning, cup up a whole bunch of onions
  and peppers, and if you want, add a clove of garlic. Place vegees in
  crockpot. Then cut up sausage in very small pieces. Add to crockpot. Cover
  with an eight-ounce can tomato sauce and add oregano, basil or whatever.
  Sook about six or seven hours. Serve in sub rolls or on hamburger burns or
  over rice.
  
        2    Barbecued Beef
  
  Get a very small pot roast.  Season and put in crockpot.  Cover with
  barbecue
  
  sauce.  Add more sauce near the end because the sauce will lose its flavor
  during cooking, or add new sauce after slicing. Remove roast from crockpot
  after cooking, and slice into thin slices. (maybe slices isn't the right
  word,
  
  it kind of shreds.)  Anyway, serve in hamburger buns.  Good with baked
  beans and salad.

           MM requires a number of
           Servings, and I don't have
           An amount on this recipe. :(
           ....................
  1 1/2 lb Bulk sausage
      2    Eggs
    3/4 c  Dry bread crumbs
      7 oz Can water chestnuts
           Drained, finely chopped
    1/2 ts Leaf basil sauce
           ..........................
           For Leaf Basil Sauce...
    1/4 c  Butter
    1/4 c  Flour
  1 1/2 c  Milk
           Salt & pepper to taste
      3 ts Prepared mustard
           ( Dijonaise)
    1/4 ts Dill weed
      1 c  Sour cream
 
        Sausage Cocktail Balls....
  
    Throughly combine all ingredients except sauce; mix well. Shape into bite
  size meatballs about 1/2 " to 1 ". Place on rack of broiler pan. Bake in a
  preheated 425 degree oven for 10-15 minutes. Drain well.
    Place browned sausage balls in a lightly greased crockpot. Cover and cook
  on low 5-6 hours. Serve on wooden picks for dipping in sauce.
  
  .........
    Sauce....( Leaf Basil )
  
    In saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Blend in flour until smooth.
  Gradually stir in milk. Add remaining ingredients. Cool and stir until
  smooth and thick.
  
  Formerly posted by Jean Rhymer with these tips for beginners; Make sure
  pork is lean or any fatty piece of meat is pre-browned for about 20
  minutes, as a lot of fat can cause overcooking in a crockpot and cause a
  loss of flavor.

      Title: Sausage Split-Pea Soup
 Categories: Meats, Soups, Crockpot
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           -T.FOX5
      1 lb Smoked sausage;sliced medium
           -thin (turkey smoked sausage
           -preferred)
      1    Onion;lrg,chopped fine
      1    Potato;lrg,scrubbed and
           -diced (don't peel it)
      1 lb Split peas
      1    Bay leaf
    1/2 ts Black pepper.
      7 c  Water
 
  Combine everything in a crock pot and cook on low for at least 8 hours.
  Stir thoroughly before serving.  To thicken the soup a bit without adding
  calories, puree about 2 cups of the soup in a food processor and stir it
  back into the soup. Italian variation: Pre-cook 1 pound of sweet or hot
  Italian sausage by steaming 15 minutes in about 1/2 inch of water in a
  skillet or by cooking at 5-minute intervals in a microwave oven. When cool
  enough to handle, slice the sausage and proceed as above, adding 1/2 tsp.
  of Italian seasoning.
    The Italian version has such a lively flavor, it even tastes good on a
  summer day. Posted on Genie 7/27/91

  on LOW and cook for 6-10 hours.
   I usually put two packs of chicken in and freeze what's left. Use the
  cooked chicken as you would for any recipe (Sw and Sour, BBQ, etc.) but for
  an instant dinner, take it out, add a little salt & pepper sprinkled over,
  and either place it on a plate plain with your veggies, potato,rice or
  noodles; or put it on a bun with whatever you like on buns. Low in fat, and
  the amount of salt is controlled, so it's filling and fast without negative
  side effects.  Kids love it.
   NOTE: I go along with another crockpot user who says she just puts in any
  old meat, veggies, sauce, etc.  I generally buy stew meat or round steak
  (two tough, cheap meats); add 1/2 to 1 cup tomato sauce or BBQ sauce,
  whatever's on hand, veggies are optional, and let'er rip. Often I fix the
  night before and refrigerate overnight. We like to eat around 5:30 PM, so I
  turn on in the early morning and long cooking is what I look for. I also
  try to double amounts to lengthen the cooking time, then am able to freeze
  part, and bring out a week later.   Combined with the microwave, I rarely
  have to stand at the stove.

  :         -Judy Lausch
  
  To convert favorite recipes for slow cookers: Regular
  Timing------------------Slow Cooking 15-30 min...........1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hr
  on high*; 4-8 on low** 35-45 min..........3 to 4 hrs on high; 6-10 on low
  50 min -3 hrs......4 to 6 hrs on high; 8-16 on low *High= 275 to 350
  degrees F.....**Low= 180 to 190 degrees F TO TEST COOKER
  TEMPERATURE-TIMING: Fill cooker half full of cold tap water. Heat, covered
  on high for 2 1/2 hours. If water boils in less time reduce recipe cooking
  time. If it takes more than 3 hours to boil add cooking time. FOR SAFETY:
  Use pot in a safe place where cord is up out of the way. Never store food
  in crockery pot. sudden temperature changes can crack ceramic liners. 180
  degrees F. is a minimum safe temperature. Read and use cooker instructions
  carefully. TO SERVE CROCKERY COOKING: Garnish with parsley, carrot curls,
  crushed corn chips, tomatoes, sauces, olives, pimentos, mint leaves, lemon
  or orange slices. ADDITIONAL CROCKERY COOKING HINTS: Use timer for starting
  pot and cooking when you aren't around; Crossed strips of folded aluminum
  foil under roast will let you lift it quickly and safely to serving dish;
  Most recipes for low temperature can be prepared in half time on high; A
  slow pot is excellent for fondue, dips, hot punch, sauces and as a bun
  warmer. Hope this helps. These ideas formatted and brought to you by Judy

      2    3lb Rump roasts
      2 ts Garlic salt
      8 oz Sliced mushrooms; drained
      1    Large onion; diced
      2 pk 1 1/2 oz.spaghetti

     Season roasts with garlic salt.  Place in crock pot. Add mushrooms and
  onion.  Combine seasoning mix and tomato sauce. Pour over all. Cover and
  cook on low 8 to 10 hours. ( High 4 to 6 hours )
     To thicken gravy: Make a paste of 4 tbs. melted butter and 4 tbs. flour.
  Add 4 tbs. tomato paste. Stir into meat drippings in crock pot. Cover and
  cook on high for approx. 30 minutes or until thickened.
   Serve over hot pasta. I have been using Shilling extra thick mix.. don't
  be alarmed if it looks too thick in the beginning. The condensation from
  the lid makes the sauce. The recipe calls for arm roasts. I never tried
  them..I have used Chuck roasts, but they fell completely apart and shredded
  when trying to slice them. So I substituted rump roasts, as theyhold their
  shape best..Hope you enjoy it !

  Cut round steak into serving portions Cut carrots into 2 inch pieces I
  pound the meat first with my tenderizer so it gets those nice little
  slashes in it (or you can buy it pre-tenderized)Season the meat with salt
  and pepper and dust with flour. In your skillet, brown the meat in oil on
  both sides. Place the vegetables in the bottom of the crockpot and place
  the meat on top of the vegetables. Mix the soup and water and pour over the
  meat. Cover and cook on low for 6 to 8 hrs. This is really good served with

    1/4 md Onion; chopped
           -OR 1 ts. minced onion
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
           -OR 1/4 ts. garlic powder
      2 tb Oil, vegetable
     28 oz Tomatoes, whole; blended
 10 1/2 oz Broth, beef condensed
           -OR 2 bouillon cubes & water
 10 1/2 oz Broth, chicken condensed
           -OR 2 bouillon cubes & water
 10 1/2 oz Soup, tomato, condensed
      1 c  -Water
    1/2 c  Pace picante sauce
      2 ts Sauce, Worcestershire
      1 ts Cumin, ground
      1 ts Chili powder
    1/2 ts Lemon pepper; (optional)
      1 ts Salt; (optional)
      4    Tortillas; corn (optional);
           -cut into 1/2 inch wedges
    1/2 c  Cheese, cheddar (2 oz);
           -shredded (optional)
      2 lb Stew meat, boneless (option)
      2 c  Chicken mixture; (optional)
           -from Chicken Flautas recipe
 
   1. Cook onion, garlic, and stew meat (if using as main course), in oil in
  Dutch oven until onion is tender but not brown; drain well. Add tomatoes
  (with juice) to Dutch oven with remaining ingredients except tortillas and
  cheese.
   2. Bring to a boil; reduce heat.  Simmer uncovered 1 hour.
   3. Add tortillas; continue simmering 10 minutes. Ladle into soup bowls;
  sprinkle with cheese and serve with additional picante sauce.
  
  Makes 6 to 8 servings, about 9 cups soup.
  
  **NOTE: This is so delicious, no one will believe how easy it is to make.
  My "variations" are listed as the "OR" in ingredients...found it to taste
  the same.  I usually don't even mess with the tortillas and cheese. It
  tastes wonderful served with "Chicken Flautas"...or just make the chicken
  as indicated in the Flauta recipe (except chunk the chicken) and just toss
  into this soup! I think this could also easily be adapted to crockpot!
  
  Note from Pace: This spicy, tortilla-topped soup owes its authentic
  south-of-the-border flavor to PACE picante sauce and slow, siesta-like
  simmering. Source: Pace Picante 40th Anniversary Cookbook From: Tonya

      Title: The Pot Roast
 Categories: Crockpot, Pot roast, Beef
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           -PEGGY ENGELLS
      2 tb Vegetable oil;
           -plus more if needed
  3 1/2 lb Beef bottom round roast;
           -well-trimmed & tied
      1 ts Salt; divided
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black
           Pepper; divided
      2 md Onions; sliced
      2 md Carrots; 1/2" slices
      4 md Boiling potatoes;1/2"slices
      2    Bay leaves
    1/2 c  -Water
      1 tb Unsalted butter
      1 tb All-purpose flour
 
   1.  In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the roast
  and cook, turning often, until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.
  Transfer the roast to a plate and season with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and
  1/4 teaspoon of the pepper.
   2.  Add more oil to the skillet, if necessary, and heat over medium heat.
  Add the onions, carrots, and potatoes and cook over medium heat, stirring
  often, until the onions are softened, about 5 minutes. Tansfer the
  vegetables to a 3 1/2 quart slow cooker. Add the bay leaves, and season
  with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Place the
  roast on top of the vegetables.
   3.  Add the water to the skillet and bring to a boil, scraping up the
  browned bits on the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Pour into the
  slow cooker.
   4.  Cover and slow-cook until the roast is very tender, 8-10 hours on LOW
  (200 degrees F.).  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the roast and the
  vegetables to a platter and cover with foil to keep warm. Skim the fat from
  the surface of the cooking liquid.
   5.  In a saucepan, melt the butter over very low heat. Add the flour and
  let bubble, stirring constantly, until lightly browned, about 1 minute.
  Whisk into the cooking liquid and bring to a simmer. Cook, whisking often,
  until thickened and reduced to about 1 cup, about 5 minutes.
   6.  Using a sharp, thin knife, slice the roast crosswise across the grain.
  Serve with the vegetables and gravy. I must confess I did not follow the
  directions for the gravy, just used the juices and it was fantastic! From

  for 5 minutes. Add celery, carrot, green onions, zucchini, basil and thyme.

      Title: Two Ingredient Chicken
 Categories: Crockpot, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Chicken -- whole
      1 c  Chicken Tonight Sweet&Spicy
 
  Remove giblets from inside chicken.  Pour 1 cup of sauce inside cavity.
  Place chicken breast-down in crockpot.  Pour remaining sauce over chicken.
  Add 1/2 cup molasses or honey, if desired.  Cook until done.
  
  Sylvia's comments: this was a desperation recipe I concocted this morning
  (as in "I don't have time to seriously season this chicken, what can I pour
  on it FAST?") that came out absolutely delicious. The kids inhaled it and
  I've been nibbling in between refilling their plates. It's almost like the
  Hunter's Chicken I've been trying to duplicate. There was lots of sauce in
  the pot, which would be great to defat and serve over rice or macaroni.

      Title: Unstuffed Cabbage
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetables, Beef, Crockpot
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           -ELAINE RADIS BGMB90B
  1 1/2 lb Lean ground beef
    1/4 c  Water
      2    Eggs
      3 tb Uncooked rice
      2 ts Dried minced onions, divided
      2 tb Dried minced onions
    1/4 c  Brown sugar; to taste
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
     28 oz Whole peeled tomatoes
      6 oz Tomato paste
    1/2 c  Vinegar; or lemon juice
      6    Ginger snaps; for flavor
      1    Med head cabbage
 
  In a large bowl, combine beef, water, eggs, rice, 2 tsp dried minced onion,
  salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly with you hands and form into golf
  ball-sized balls. Set aside.
  
  In another large bowl, combine tomatoes, tomato paste, rest of dried minced
  onions, vinegar and brown sugar to taste. With a knife, cut the tomatoes
  into chunks and stir until well mixed. Add the ginger snaps (crumbled) and
  stir. Taste and correct for flavor; should be sweet and sour. Set aside.
  Core the cabbage and shred. Place half of the cabbage on the bottom of a
  shallow casserole which has a tight-fitting lid. Cover the cabbage with
  half the tomato mixture. Arrange the meat balls on top and cover with
  remaining cabbage. Top with the remaining tomato mixture. Cover tightly
  with foil and place the lid on top. Bake at 325 degrees for one hour.
  Reduce heat to 250 degrees and bake for three more hours.
  
  At This point, the casserole may be cooled, wrapped and frozen. For the
  best taste, remove casserole from 1:11 PM
  
  the oven, cool and refrigerate overnight. The next day, let the casserole
  come to room temperature and then bake, uncovered, at 300 degrees for 45
  minutes. If the casserole is to be eaten the same day, remove the lid for
  at least 45 minutes of the three-hour baking time. This recipe makes six to
  eight services.
  
  NOTE: I sometimes brown the meat and then add the other ingredients. it can
  also be made in the crockpot.
