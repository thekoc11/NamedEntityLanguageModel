 Categories: Side dish, Vegetables, Holiday, Casseroles
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           -ELAINE RADIS BGMB90B
      2 lb Butternut squash; peeled,
           -seeded and cut into 1 1/2"
           -chunks
      2 tb Olive oil
           Kosher salt; and freshly
           Ground pepper; to taste
    1/2 c  Red wine vinegar
    1/4 c  Clover honey
      2 cl Garlic; finely chopped
      2 sm Dried red chilies
    1/2 ts Coriander seed
    1/2 ts Fennel seed
 
  Stan Frankenthaler, is a chef at Caffe Gianni, in downtown Boston.
  This dish is equally good hot or at room temperature.
  
  Set the oven at 425 degrees.  In a large bowl, toss the butternut
  squash with the olive oil and salt and pepper. Place the mixture in a
  large heavy duty baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 10
  to 20 minutes or until soft but still holding its shape.
  
  While the squash is baking, place the red wine vinegar, hone and
  garlic in a small sauce pan.  In a grinder or using a mortal and
  pestle, grind the chilies, coriander seed and fennel seed together
  and add to the saucepan.
   Bring the mixture to a boil and reduce to 1/2 cup. Taste to make
  sure the glaze is a little more tangy then sweet and adjust
  seasonings if necessary.
  
  When the squash is cooked, remove from the oven and place in a
  decorative bowl.  Toss with the glaze, adjusting the salt and pepper
  if needed.

      Title: SWEET & SOUR CABBAGE SOUP
 Categories: Digest, Jan.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Head cabbage
      2 lg Cans crushed tomatoes with
           Added puree
           (or some equivalent)
      1 lg Onion
      5    Cloves garlic
           Juice of 2 lemons or about
           1/4*cup balsamic or wine
           Vinegar
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
      1    2 talbespoons of grated
           Fresh ginger
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  ~ slice cabbage thinly to create cabbage strips, - half onion and
  slice thinly to create half rings - crush, slice or dice garlic -
  grate ginger
  
  Put everything in a large soup pot and add water to cover plus a
  little more. Bring to boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for
  2-3 hours (longer the better).
  
  Don't be afraid to add more tomato, sugar, or vinegar if you like it
  more tomatoey, sweeter, or more sour. Taste a couple hours into the
  cooking for adjustment. The cabbage will have imparted its flavor and
  the tomatoes will have mellowed.
  
  You can also add rice during the last 45 - 30 minutes (also add the
  more water appropriate for the amount of rice you add. For example, I
  added 3/4 cup brown rice and 1 1/2 cup water the last 40 minutes)
  
  Or add a can of white or gabanzo beans. (Again these won't need
  cooking, so just add at the end)
  
  [If you're not a vegetarian, you can use b**f or ch*ck*n stock. Even
  some browned ground m**t or soup bones.]

      1 tb Rice wine or dry sherry
      1 tb Light soy sauce
    1/2 ts Salt

      2    Scallions
      1    Egg, beaten
      2 tb Cornstarch
      2 c  Oil, preferably peanut
      3 oz Canned leches, drained, or:
      1    -fresh orange in segments

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
    2/3 c  Chicken stock
      1 tb Light soy sauce
    1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 tb Chinese white rice vinegar
           - or: cider vinegar
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Tomato paste
      1 ts Cornstarch
      1 ts Water
 
  CUT THE CHICKEN INTO 1-INCH cubes. Put the cubes into a bowl together
  with the rice wine or sherry, 1 tablespoon of light soy sauce and 1/2
  teaspoon salt, and marinate for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the green
  and red peppers into 1-inch squares. Peel and cut the carrots and
  scallions into 1-inch chunks. (The uniform size of meat and
  vegetables adds to the visual appeal of the dish.) Bring a pot of
  water to a boil and blanch the carrots in it for 4 minutes, then
  drain and set aside. Mix the egg and cornstarch in a bowl until they
  are well blended into a batter. Lift the chicken cubes out of the
  marinade, put them into a batter and coat each piece well. Heat the
  oil in a deep-fat fryer or large wok until it is almost smoking.
  Remove the chicken pieces from the batter with a slotted spoon and
  deep-fry them. Drain the deep-fried chicken cubes on paper towels.
  
  TO MAKE THE SAUCE: Combine the chicken stock, soy sauce, salt,
  vinegar, sugar and tomato paste in a large saucepan. Bring it to a
  boil. Add all the vegetables, but not the leches or oranges, and stir
  well. In a small bowl, blend together the cornstarch and water. Stir
  this mixture into the sauce, and bring it back to a boil. Turn the
  heat down to a simmer. Add the leches or oranges and chicken cubes.
  Mix well, then turn the mixture onto a deep platter. Serve at once.

  In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.
  
  The sweet and tart citrus flavor of this loaf complements chicken,
  turkey, and cold roast pork. Toast made from this moist, dense bread
  has a clear flavor that should not be masked by anything more
  overbearing than a slim coating of butter or cottage cheese.

           -inch strips
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts White pepper
           Sweet and Sour Sauce
    1/2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Distilled white vinegar
    1/3 c  Packed brown sugar
    1/4 c  Chinese pickled cucumber
           -(optional)
      3 tb Ketchup
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Hot pepper sauce
      1 pn White pepper
           Flour for dry-coating
      1    Egg, lightly beaten
           Cornstarch for dry-coating
           Vegetable oil for
           -deep-frying
    1/2 sm Carrot, cut into match-stick
           -pieces
      1    Green onion (including top)
           -cut into 2-inch slivers
      2 ts Cornstarch mixed with 1
           -tablespoon water
 
  Some cooks are surprised to see ketchup used in Chinese cooking. They
  might be less surprised if they knew that the name (and the
  condiment) came from Asia in the first place. "Ketjap" (or "kecap",
  both pronounced the same) is a Malay word meaning "seasoned Sauce."
  
  Preparation:
  
  Sprinkle fish with salt and pepper and set aside.
  
  Combine sweet and sour sauce ingredients in a medium bowl and set
  aside.
  
  Place flour, egg and cornstarch in separate bowls. Coat each piece of
  fish with flour, shaking off excess. Dip fish in egg, then dredge with
  cornstarch. Set aside for 10 minutes.
  
  Cooking:
  
  Set wok in a ring stand and add oil to a depth of about 2 inches.
  Over high heat, bring oil to 360 deg.F. Add fish,a few pieces at a
  time, and cook for 4 minutes or until golden brown. Lift out and
  drain on paper towels. Keep warm in a 200 deg.F oven while cooking
  remaining fish.
  
  Bring sauce to a boil over medium-high heat. Add carrot and green
  onion and cook for 30 seconds. Add cornstarch solution and cook,
  stirring until sauce boils and thickens.
  
  Pour sauce on a platter. Arrange fish over sauce and serve
  immediately.

      Title: SWEET & SOUR FISH FILLETS
 Categories: Fish, Oriental, Wok
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Ocean perch
           Corn starch
    1/2 c  Flour
      1    Egg
    1/2 c  Water
           Salt
           Oil for deep frying
    1/3 c  Brown sugar
    1/3 c  Cider vinegar
    1/2 c  Pineapple chunks
    1/2    Carrot, shredded
    2/3 c  Sweet pickles
      1    Tomato, cut into wedges
  1 1/2 tb Corn starch, dissolved in
    1/2 c  Water
 
  1. Slice ocean perch fillets into pieces about 2x1". Dredge in corn
  starch and allow to dry slightly on wax paper. Make a batter of about
  1/2 cup flour, 1 egg,
      1/2    cup water, and salt
  
  2. In a separate small pot, dissolve 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup
  cider vinegar over medium heat. Stir up corn starch in 1/2 cup water,
  add to pot. Stir thoroughly. Add pineapple, carrot, sweet pickles,
  and tomato. Cook 3-5 minutes until sauce is clear and not cloudy.
  Reserve.
  
  3. Pour oil halfway up wok. Turn heat on highest point. When you
  think oil is hot enough for deep frying, take a piece of bread crust
  and place in oil to see if it is ready. If the bread crust is not
  browned readily, then oil is not ready. If the bread crust is medium
  brown, then oil is ready. If the bread crust is a dark brown, then
  turn oil off and allow it to cool at least 5 minutes before using. Be
  sure and retest oil before deep frying anything in it. When the oil
  is ready, place 8-10 pieces of fish in batter. Take a pair of
  chopsticks or fork and carefully lift pieces of fish from batter into
  oil. At first the fish will sink to bottom of oil. They will rise.
  When the fish is risen, deep fry about 4 minutes, 2 minutes on each
  side. Remove fish to paper toweling to drain excess oil, then arrange
  fish on serving platter. repeat procedure until all fish is deep
  fried. Pour sweet and sour sauce over fish.
  
  NOTE: Shrimp or chicken are good substituted for the fish in this
  recipe.

           Oil for deep frying
    1/3 c  Brown sugar
    1/3 c  Cider vinegar
    1/2 c  Pineapple chunks
    1/2    Carrot, shredded
    2/3 c  Sweet pickles
      1    Tomato, cut into wedges
  1 1/2 tb Corn starch, dissolved in
    1/2 c  Water
 
  1. Slice ocean perch fillets into pieces about 2x1". Dredge in corn
  starch and allow to dry slightly on wax paper. Make a batter of about
  1/2 cup flour, 1 egg,
      1/2    cup water, and salt
  
  2. In a separate small pot, dissolve 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup
  cider vinegar over medium heat. Stir up corn starch in 1/2 cup water,
  add to pot. Stir thoroughly. Add pineapple, carrot, sweet pickles,
  and tomato. Cook 3-5 minutes until sauce is clear and not cloudy.
  Reserve.
  
  3. Pour oil halfway up wok. Turn heat on highest point. When you
  think oil is hot enough for deep frying, take a piece of bread crust
  and place in oil to see if it is ready. If the bread crust is not
  browned readily, then oil is not ready. If the bread crust is medium
  brown, then oil is ready. If the bread crust is a dark brown, then
  turn oil off and allow it to cool at least 5 minutes before using. Be
  sure and retest oil before deep frying anything in it. When the oil
  is ready, place 8-10 pieces of fish in batter. Take a pair of
  chopsticks or fork and carefully lift pieces of fish from batter into
  oil. At first the fish will sink to bottom of oil. They will rise.
  When the fish is risen, deep fry about 4 minutes, 2 minutes on each
  side. Remove fish to paper toweling to drain excess oil, then arrange
  fish on serving platter. repeat procedure until all fish is deep
  fried. Pour sweet and sour sauce over fish.
  
  NOTE: Shrimp or chicken are good substituted for the fish in this
  recipe.

 Categories: Main dish, Meats, Appetizers, Microwave
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter or margarine
      2 lb Shoulder lamb chops
           Salt and pepper
      8 oz Pineapple chunks in unsweet-
           Ened juice, undrained
    1/4 c  Firm packed dark brown sugar
    1/4 c  White vinegar
      1 tb Cornstarch
    1/2 ts Brown bouquet sauce
      2    Carrots, peeled and
           -thinly sliced
      1 lg Green pepper, cut into
           -1-inch squares
 
  I. Melt butter in a heat-resistant, non-metallic broiler-proof
  skillet on a conventional surface unit. When butter is hot, sear lamb
  chops on both sides until lightly browned. Sprinkle with salt and
  pepper to taste. Or use the "browner" for 4 to 5 minutes per side. 2.
  While the chops are browning, drain pineapple juice into a small
  heat-resistant, non-metallic bowl. Reserve pineapple chunks; add
  brown sugar, vinegar, cornstarch and brown bouquet sauce to pineapple
  juice. Stir to combine. 3. Heat pineapple juice mixture, uncovered, 2
  minutes in Micro- wave Oven or until thickened and clear. 4. Pour
  thickened sauce over browned lamb chops. 5. Add carrot slices and
  heat, covered, 5 minutes in Microwave Oven. Add pineapple chunks and
  heat, covered, 2 1/2 minutes in Microwave Oven. Add green pepper
  squares and heat, un- covered, in Microwave Oven 2 1/2 minutes, or
  until lamb and vegetables are tender. Variations: Pork chops, veal
  chops, boneless chicken pieces or shrimp may be substituted for the
  lamb chops; however, cooking times will have to be adjusted for pork,
  chicken, and shrimp. Pork chops will require an extra 2 minutes in
  Step 5, as pork should always be cooked to well-done. Chicken should
  be cooked for only 4 minutes in Step 5 and shrimp 3 minutes.

      Title: SWEET & SOUR PEPPERS WITH ALMONDS (MANDORLA
 Categories: Italian, Vegetables
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    1/3 c  Dark raisins (2 oz.)
      3 md Red bell peppers
           (about 1-1/4 lbs.),
           Quartered and deribbed
      2 md Green bell peppers
           (about 3/4 lb.),
           Quartered and deribbed
      3 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
    1/3 c  Slivered almonds
           (1-1/2 oz.)
      2 tb Sugar
      3 tb Red wine vinegar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
 
  1.  In a small bowl, soak the raisins in warm water for 20 minutes;
  drain and set aside. 2. If you want to peel the peppers, cut the
  quartered peppers in half lengthwise and flatten slightly. Peel the
  pieces with a swivel-bladed vegetable peeler, then cut them
  lengthwise into 1/2-inch strips. Alternatively, slice unpeeled
  peppers into 1/4-inch strips. 3. In a large saucepan, heat the oil
  over moderate heat. Add the almonds and cook, stirring occasionally,
  for 2 minutes. Add the raisins and cook for 1 minute, then stir in
  the peppers, sugar, vinegar and salt. Cover and cook for 20 minutes.
  Uncover and continue to cook until the peppers are very tender and
  slightly glazed, 10 to 15 minutes longer. If the peppers begin to
  stick to the pan, add 1 to 2 Tablespoons of warm water. Serve at room
  temperature.  (This dish can also be made several hours ahead and
  reheated just before serving.) This delicious and unusual pepper dish
  is from Basilicata in the instep of the Italian boot. It is wonderful
  with grilled meat, especially Italian sausages. Peeling the peppers
  without roasting them first makes them particularly succulent, but
  peeling isn't mandatory. The dish is delicious either way.

  Had a house guest last week++an old friend who likes my Chinese
  cooking, but tends to prefer the tamer stuff++you know, things
  without tentacles or feet.  So I whipped up a batch of this
  excellent, quick and easy sweet and sour pork.  It's a long time
  favorite that I haven't cooked for a some time.  Been too busy with
  Thai and Vietnamese food to make it. It was just as excellent as I
  remember it being and I actually improved on it with a couple of
  substitutions.
  
  I used 1/2 cup palm sugar instead of 1/2 cup brown sugar. Palm sugar
  has a rich, complex and addicting taste while being a little less
  cloyingly sweet than regular sugars. It gives a taste that's "exotic"
  without being obvious.  Where the recipe calls for 3/4 cup pineapple
  juice I used 3/4 cup of the juice from some brandied peaches I made.
  I made 'em months ago and froze the leftover juice specifically to
  use in a sweet and sour dish. (This is a good thing to do with any
  sweet fruity type juice.)
  
  I left out the maraschino cherries++bleechhhhh!++and substituted a
  red bell pepper for the color contrast. The only thing even faintly
  exotic in the recipe is the canned lichees (also a good juice to save
  for sweet and sour stuff) and that can be omitted if you can't find
  them++or use canned apricots or whatever instead. You could also use
  longans or rambutans, which are close relatives of lichee, quite
  successfully.
  
  Yield: 6 servings
  
  PREPARATION:  Drain fruits, prepare sauce mixture. Marinate pork in
  meat marinade for 1/2 hour.
  
  COOKING:  Deep fry pork cubes in a wok for about 3 to 4 minutes until
  golden brown.  Drain.  Pour all the oil back into the bottle. Add
  sauce mixture into wok and stir until thickened. Add green pepper and
  onions and cook for 2 minutes.  Add pork cubes and stir until heated
  through. Add fruits and stir until they're coated with the sauce.
  
  DO-AHEAD NOTES:  Cook through making the sauce.  Just before serving,
  add pork, vegetables and fruit according to directions.

      Title: SWEET & SOUR PORK (TIEM SHUEN GEE YOK)
 Categories: Chinese, Pork, Fruits, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Pork fillet
      1 tb Rice Wine
      1 tb Soy sauce
    1/2 c  Cornstarch
      1 sm Carrot
      1 lg Green pepper
      2 sl Canned pineapple
      4    Chinese dried mushrooms
      1 cl Garlic
    1/4 c  White vinegar
    1/2 c  Water
    1/8 ts Black pepper
      1 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Salt
      5 tb Sugar
      1 ts Dried chili pepper
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 tb Water
           Oil for deep frying
      2 tb Oil
 
  PREPARATION:
  
  Cut pork into 3/4-inch cubes.  Mix the sherry and 1 tablespoon soy
  sauce together, and add to the pork. With your fingers rub the
  mixture into meat. Still using your fingers, roll the cubes in about
  1/2 cup cornstarch until thoroughly dredged but not too thickly
  covered. (The fineness of the end result of this recipe depends on
  the meat's being crisp -- never soggy.) Cut the carrot on the
  diagonal into 1/4-inch slices. Cut the green pepper in half; remove
  seeds and cut into 1-inch squares. Cut the pineapple slices into
  1/2-inch wedges. Wash the Chinese mushrooms and soak in warm water
  for 30 minutes.  Drain, remove stems. Cut into 1/2-inch strips.
  Smash, peel, and mince garlic. Combine garlic, carrots, green pepper,
  pineapple, and mushrooms.  Combine vinegar, 1/2 cup water, black
  pepper, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, salt, sugar, and chili pepper. In a
  cup, mix 1 tablespoon cornstarch with 1 tablespoon water.
  
  COOKING:
  
  Heat oil in deep fry pan to 375-degrees.  Cook pork cubes a few at a
  time until very light brown, about 5 minutes. Stir with a chopstick
  occasionally so that the cubes do not touch each other. Drain on
  paper towels, and keep hot in low oven (200-degrees). Repeat this
  process, cooking pork in hot oil until cubes float and are golden
  brown -- 2 to 3 minutes. (This double cooking insures that the meat
  will be crisp.) Heat the water-vinegar mixture in small saucepan. In
  a medium-sized skillet or wok, heat 2 tablespoons of oil at high
  heat.  Add vegetable-pineapple mixture and stir-fry for 4 minutes.
  Add the hot water-vinegar mixture to the vegetables and stir well.
  Add the cornstarch mixture, and cook and stir until thickened, about
  1 minute. Pour sauce over pork cubes and mix.

      Title: SWEET & SOUR RED SQUASH WITH MINT
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Banana squash
    1/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
      4    Cloves garlic; peeled and
           -lightly crushed
    1/4 c  Mint leaves; coarse chop
    1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
    1/4 c  Sugar
           Salt & pepper to taste
 
  This should marinate for several hours before serving. It lasts for
  several days refrigerated.
  
  Cut squash across into 3-inch-wide lengths. Use a vegetable peeler to
  remove the peel. Cut each piece crosswise into slices that a little
  over 1/4-inch thick.
  
  Place the olive oil and garlic cloves in a medium saute pan. Saute the
  garlic over low heat until it turns a golden brown. Discard the
  garlic.
  
  Cook the squash in the oil on both sides until they blister and turn
  golden brown. Cook the squash in batches, one layer at a time and
  without crowding the pan. Use a thin wooden skewer to check for
  tenderness. The squash slices should be tender but hold their shape.
  
  As each batch is cooked, transfer the slices to a platter. When all
  the squash is cooked, sprinkle the chopped mint over the top. Add to
  the remaining olive oil in the pan the vinegar, sugar, and salt and
  pepper to taste. Stir well and raise the heat to high. Let the
  mixture boil until it thickens slightly. Pour the hot liquid over the
  squash slices. Let cool.

    1/2 ts Fine sea salt
    1/8 ts Cayenne pepper
      3 c  Water
      1 tb Canola or safflower oil
  1 1/2 c  Couscous
           -- preferably whole wheat
      1 md Carrot; finely chopped
      1 c  Sliced green beans
           -OR- yellow wax beans

           -- seeded and finely chopped
    1/2 sm Red onion; finley chopped
    1/4 c  Finely chopped fresh mint
           -OR- parsley

MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Tamari-roasted almonds
           -- coarsley chopped
 
  Put the currants, orange juice, lemon juice, 1/3 cup oil, cinnamon,
  salt, and cayenne in a jar.  Cover with the lid and shake until the
  ingredients are well mixed.
  
  In a medium saucepan, bring the water and 1 tablespoon oil to a boil.
  Stir in the couscous.  Immediately remove from the heat, cover, and
  let stand until the water is absorbed, about 6 minutes. Transfer the
  couscous to a large bowl, and fluff with a fork.  Cool completely.
  
  Put 1 inch of water in a large saucepan with a steamer basket, cover
  with the lid, and bring to a gentle boil. Put the carrot, green
  beans, and bell pepper in the steamer basket, cover with the steamer
  (lid? ~K.M.), and steam until the vegetables are a bright color,
  about 3 minutes. Remove the steamed vegetables from the basket; they
  should still have a crunch. Rinse under cold water, drain, and cool
  completely.
  
  Stir the steamed vegetables, onion, and mint into the couscous. Shake
  the Spicy Currant Dressing and pour it over the salad. Stir until
  well coated. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors
  to blend. Sprinkle the toasted almonds over the top just before
  serving and serve chilled. (If the salad is prepared more than a few
  hours ahead, adjust the seasonings before serving.)

      Title: SWEET BUTTERY TART CRUST
 Categories: Pies, Basics
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 2/3 c  Flour
    1/4 c  Sugar, very fine
    1/2 ts Salt
     10 tb Butter -chilled
      2    Egg yolks
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      2 ts -cold water
 
    1. Sift flour, sugar and salt into a mixing bowl. Cut chilled sweet
  butter into pieces into the bowl. Using your fingertips, rapidly rub
  the butter and dry ingredients together until th mixture resembles
  course meal. Be careful to use only your fingertips as your palms
  will warm the dough.
    2. Stir egg yolks, vanilla and water together and add to the flour-
  butter mixture and blend in, using a fork. Shape dough into a ball.
  This should not take more than 30 to 45 seconds.
    3. Place the ball of dough onto a pastry board. With the heel of
  your hand, smear about ¬ cup of dough away from you into a 6- to
  8-inch smear; repeat until all the dough has been dealt with. Scrape
  dough together; re- form into a ball, wrap in wax paper and chill for
  2 to 3 hours.
    4. Roll out dough between two sheets of wax paper, or use a floured
  pastry cloth and floured stockinette on your rolling pin, into a round
  large enough to line your pan. Work quickly, as the dough can become
  sticky.
    5. Line either an 8- or 9-inch false-bottom tart pan with dough,
  fitting it loosely into pan and pressing to fit sides. Trim edges 3/4
  inch outside top of pan, and fold this edge over into inside, and
  press into place with fingers. Chill.
    6. Preheat over to 425øF.
    7. Line dough in the tart pan with a piece of aluminium foil or wax
  paper and fill with raw beans, rice or pastry weights. Bake for 8
  minutes. Remove weights and foil. Prick the bottom of the dough with
  a fork in several places. For a partially baked shell, return to oven
  for 3 to 4 minutes longer. For a fully baked shell, return for 8 to
  10 minutes longer, or until edges are light brown. [One 8-inch to
  9-inch shell]

      Title: SWEET CHEESE STRUDEL
 Categories: Desserts, Brunch
      Yield: 1 Strudel
 
MMMMM-----------------------CHEESE FILLING----------------------------
    1/3 c  Sugar
      2 ts Cornstarch
      1    Egg white, lightly beaten
      1 ts Pure vanilla extract
    1/2 ts Grated lemon zest
      1 c  Part-skim ricotta cheese,
           -preferably without added
           -gums or stabilizers
    1/2 c  Raisins

MMMMM--------------------------STRUDEL-------------------------------
      1 tb Canola oil
    1/2 tb Butter, melted
      2 tb Fine dry breadcrumbs
      8    Sheets phyllo dough (14x18
           -inches), thawed if frozen
      2 tb Confectioners' sugar
 
  Phyllo dough, low in calories and fat, is a crisp counterpoint to the
  creamy cheese filling.
  
  To make filling: In a small bowl, combine sugar, cornstarch, egg
  white, vanilla and lemon zest; stir gently until well combined. With
  a rubber spatula, gently fold in ricotta cheese just until combined.
  Gently fold in raisins. Set aside.
  
  To make strudel: 1. Preheat oven to 350 B0F. Lightly oil a large
  baking sheet or coat it with nonstick cooking spray.
  
  2. In a small bowl, combine oil and butter. Unroll phyllo onto a
  clean, dry surface; cover with wax paper and then a slightly damp tea
  towel to prevent the dough from drying out.
  
  3. Lay one sheet of phyllo on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle
  with 1/2 teaspoon of the oil/butter mixture and spread it thin with a
  pastry brush. (Not all the dough will be covered.) Sprinkle with 1/2
  teaspoon breadcrumbs. Repeat with 7 more sheets of phyllo, aligning
  each sheet over the previous ones. Over the eighth layer, sprinkle
  all the remaining breadcrumbs; reserve the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons
  of the oil/butter mixture.
  
  4. Gently spoon the cheese filling in a long, 12-by-2-inch mound
  along one long edge of the phyllo layers, leaving a 2-inch border
  between the mound and the edges of the phyllo. Fold up the long edge
  and loosely roll up the strudel. (Do not roll too tightly; the
  filling will expand during baking.) Set the strudel seam-side down on
  the baking sheet. Fold and tuck the open ends securely but not
  tightly beneath the roll.
  
  5. Brush the strudel with the remaining oil/butter mixture. With a
  sharp paring knife, make four short (1-inch) diagonal slashes along
  the top of the strudel to allow steam to escape. Bake for 35 to 40
  minutes, or until the phyllo is golden brown. Carefully transfer the
  strudel to a wire rack and let cool completely. Just before serving,
  dust with confectioners 92 sugar.
  
  Serve the strudel at brunch, or dress it up at dinner with a
  strawberry puree.

      Title: SWEET CICELY
 Categories: Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Info
      Yield: 1 Info below
 
      1    Info below
 
  Sweet cicely (Myrrhis odorata) is in the Umbelliferae family. It's a
  hardy perennial with a scent that's been compared to lovage and which
  has also been described as having a spicy flavor like licorice. Sweet
  cicely can be substituted for caraway seeds in baking. Press fresh
  sweet cicely leaves firmly into bluefish before grilling them, or
  grate the root and add it to quick breads and muffins.  Anise can be
  substituted for sweet cicely.
  
  Flowers are white, numerous, 2" across and are in compound umbels of
  5 to 10 smaller umbels.  Inner blooms are male and outer blooms are
  bisexual. The leaves are fernlike, two or three times pinnately
  divided and in toothed or finely lobed leaflets.  They are whitish,
  downy and spotted underneath.  Leaf stalks wrap around the stem. The
  fruit is shiny, dark brown and the seeds are sharply ridged and to 1"
  long. The plant flowers in May and June and is native to Europe and
  naturalized in North America. It's hardy to Zone 3 and prefers moist,
  well-drained, humusy soil and partial shade.
  
  Rodale writes:  "Here's an herb that seems to have made it onto
  everyone's 'Most Often Overlooked' list, but not into very many
  gardens. Although some gardeners have found it difficult to
  propagate, it will reward the persistent with a beautiful ornamental
  form, a sweet anise taste and a few medicinal uses.
  
  "Although the plant has been in use in cooking and medicine at least
  since Roman times, little seems to have been written about it.
  Indeed, the old herbalists spent most of their words in comparing it
  to other plants like hemlock, chervil, lovage and anise.  It was used
  as a preventative in time of plague, as a tonic for young girls and
  old people, and as an aromatic, a stomachic, a carminative and an
  expectorate.
  
  "Uses: Medicinal: Sweet cicely is employed in folk medicine in some
  parts of the world, but its uses have not been tested scientifically.
  It does seem to increase appetite and decrease flatulence, and we
  know that the roots are antiseptic.  All seem to agree that it is
  harmless, which in a way seems to be damning it with faint praise."
  
  "Culinary: Sweet cicely's flavor is a combination of celery and
  anise. The leaves of the plant are used fresh as garnishes, in salads
  or in recipes where a sweet touch is needed. The root is steamed,
  simmered or cooked and pureed like a parsnip, and the seeds are used
  in candy, syrups, cakes and liqueurs.
  
  "Sweet cicely cooperates with carrots, parsnips, potatoes, turnips,
  Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cream soups and sauces, and fish, and in
  fruit soups, stewed fruit, fruit salads, pies and tarts.
  
  "Ornamental: The lacy foliage and large white blossoms that bloom in
  spring make it a good plant for mixed flower beds. The seeds are
  decorative enough for winter bouquets."
  
  "Cultivation:  If possible, start from purchased or dug seedling
  plants, or divide the plant in the fall. The seed needs to have
  undergone rather mysterious patterns of freeze and thaw and is
  notoriously slow and finicky about germinating.  If you do use it,
  use fresh seed and sow in the fall.
  
  "Harvesting and storage: Harvest leaves throughout their growing
  season. One plant will yield 4 cups of leaves and 1/2 cup of seeds in
  a season. Plant parts are seldom dried."

      1    Can cream style corn
     10 oz Package frozen corn
  1 3/4 c  Milk
    1/4 ts Black pepper
      7 oz Jar roasted red peppers,
           Drained and thinly sliced
      1 lb Large shrimp, shelled
 
  Heat the oil for 1 minute in a large saucepan over moderate heat. Add
  the onion and saute, stirring until limp, about 5 minutes. Add the
  potato, bay leaf, marjoram, nutmeg, and stock, and bring to a boil.
  Lower the heat to moderate, cover, and cook at a gentle boil until
  the potato is just tender, about 10 minutes. Add the cream-style
  corn, corn kernels, milk, and black pepper, and bring to a rapid
  boil. Lower the heat to moderate, add the red peppers and shrimp, and
  boil gently, uncovered, until the shrimp are just cooked through,
  about 3 minutes.

      Title: SWEET CUCUMBER CHUNKS
 Categories: Pickles
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
     10    Cucumbers, not too fat
      8 c  Sugar
      2 tb Pickling spice
           -(see note)
      5 ts Salt (non-iodized salt
           -is best)
      4 c  Vinegar
 
  Wash cucumbers and place in large pot.  Pour boiling water over
  cucumbers until they are covered.  Let stand for 24 hours and then
  drain. Repeat this procedure for three (3) days. The cucumbers will
  be rather slimy after this. This is normal.
  
  On the fourth day drain and slice into bite-size chunks. If the
  cucumbers are fat you can halve or quarter the chunks so you end up
  with bite-size pieces.
  
  Combine the remaining ingredients.  Bring mixture to a boil, stirring
  frequently.  Pour cooked mixture over the cucumber pieces. Return to a
  boil, but just a boil. Do not cook. Pour cucumbers and liquid mixture
  into canning jars and seal. Jars should be sealed in a boiling water
  bath for 10 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A very sweet cucumber pickle -- My wife's grandmother provided us
  with this wonderful pickle recipe. Yield: Serves many.
  
  *  These are best if they sit for a month or so after canning, to
  give them time to work.  If you use iodized salt, they are more
  likely to get cloudy during that month.
  
  *  If your grocery does not sell pre-mixed pickling spice mixtures,
  try various combinations of mustard seeds, celery seeds, coriander,
  dill, or any other strongly-flavored spices that you like.
  
  *  We increase this recipe by several times.  Last year we used about
  200 cucumbers.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  4 days of soaking.  About 1-2 hours of real work.
  : Precision:  Approximate measure ok.

MMMMM-----------------DIRECTIONS FOR SWEET DOUGH----------------------
 
  1.  In large bowl, combine sugar, salt, yeast, and 2 cups flour. In

      occasionally scraping bowl.
  
  3.  With spoon, stir in enough additional flour (about
    4 1/2 c) to
      make a soft dough.
  
  4.  Turn dough onto lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and
      elastic, about 10 minutes.  Shape into a ball.
  
  5.  Turn over in greased large bowl to grease top; Cover; let rise in
      warm place until dough is doubled, about 1 hour.
  
  6.  Punch down dough.  On lightly floured surface, divide into pieces

      Title: SWEET DOUGH FOR PIES
 Categories: 
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           One crust pie -- about 10
           Ounces
           Dough:
  1 1/4 c  All purpose bleached flour
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Baking powder
    1/8 ts Salt
      4 tb Cold unsalted butter -- (1/2
           Stick)
      1 lg Egg
           Two crust pie -- about 1 1/4
           Pounds
           Dough:
  2 1/2 c  All purpose bleached flour
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
      8 tb Cold unsalted butter -- (1
           Stick)
      2 lg Eggs
 
  To mix the dough by hand, combine flour, sugar, salt and baking
  powder in a medium mixing bowl and stir well to mix. Cut butter into
  1 tablespoon pieces and add to dry ingredients. Toss once or twice to
  coat pieces of butter. Then using your hands or a pastry blender,
  break the butter into tiny pieces and pinch and squeeze it into the
  dry ingredients. Occasionally reach down to the bottom of the bowl
  and mix all the ingredients evenly together. Continue rubbing the
  butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles a coarse
  ground corn meal and no large pieces of butter remain visible. Beat
  the egg(s) in a small bowl and pour over the flour and butter
  mixture. Stir in with a fork until the dough begins to hold together,
  but still appears somewhat dry. Scatter a teaspoon of flour on the
  work surface and scrape the dough out onto it. Press and knead the
  dough quickly 3 or 4 times, until it is smooth and uniform. To mix
  the dough in the food processor, combine flour, sugar, salt and
  baking powder in work bowl fitted with metal blade. Pulse 3 times at
  1second intervals to mix. Cut butter into 1tablespoon pieces and add
  to work bowl. Process, pulsing repeatedly at 1second intervals, until
  the mixture is fine and powdery, resembles a coarse ground cornmeal
  and no large pieces of butter remain visible, about 15 pulses in all.
  Add the egg(s) to the work bowl and pulse ten times or so, until the
  dough forms a ball. Scatter a teaspoon of flour on the work surface
  and scrape the dough out onto it. Press and knead the dough quickly 3
  or 4 times, until it is smooth and uniform. Press the dough into a
  disk (two equal disks for the larger amount of dough). Sandwich the
  disk(s) of dough between two pieces of plastic wrap and press it into
  a 6 inch circle. Refrigerate the dough until firm, or until you are
  ready to use it, at least 1 hour. Storage: Keep the dough in the
  refrigerator up to two days, or freeze it doublewrapped in plastic.
  Because the dough is thin, it will defrost quickly at room
  temperature when you intend to use it. Variations: SPICE CRUST: Add
  1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon each freshly grated
  nutmeg and ground cloves to the dry ingredients before mixing in the
  butter. Double the quantities for the 2 crust recipe. COCOA DOUGH:
  Add 2 tablespoons sifted non alkalized cocoa powder to the dry
  ingredients before mixing in the butter. Double the quantities for
  the 2 crust recipe. If the dough seems dry after adding egg(s), add a
  teaspoon or two of water, no more.

      Title: SWEET FRIED CREAM (CREMA FRITTA)
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Milk
      6    Egg yolks
      6 tb Sugar
      1    Lemon, grated zest of
    1/4 c  All purpose flour
  1 1/2 c  Very fine, dry unflavored
           -breadcrumbs
      2    Eggs, lightly beaten
           Oil for frying
    1/3 c  Powdered sugar
 
  Servings: 6 to 8
  
  DIRECTIONS: Bring milk to a boil in a medium saucepan. In a large
  heavy saucepan off the heat, beat egg yolks, granulated sugar and
  lemon zest until pale and thick. Beat in flour until well blended.
  Very slowly pour in hot milk, beating constantly. Cook custard cream
  over medium heat 5 to 8 minutes, beating constantly. Do not let boil.
  Custard cream is done when it coats the back of a spoon. Moisten a
  large plate or cookie sheet with water. Spread cooked cream to a
  thickness of 1/2 to 1 inch. Cream can be prepared to this point a day
  or two ahead. When cream is completely cooled, cut into squares or

 Categories: Desserts, Fruits
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  White hominy (about one 29
           -ounce can); drained
      4 ts Confectioners' sugar
      2 tb Heavy (whipping) cream
      1 pt Ripe strawberries; hulled
           -(1 basket)
      2    Ripe mangos
      4 tb Butter
      2 tb Dark brown sugar
      6    Flour tortillas
 
  1.  In a food processor, blender, or food mill, puree the hominy.
  Stir in the confectioners' sugar and cream. Place about 1/3 cup of
  the hominy mixture in the center of a flour tortilla. Fold up
  envelope style.
  
  2.  Wash out the food processor or other machine and puree the
  strawberries.  Clean the machine again.
  
  3.  Peel the mangos; remove the pulp from the pits. Puree the pulp.
  
  4.  When ready to serve, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter with 1
  tablespoon of the brown sugar in a large frying pan set over medium
  heat. Heat until the butter foams and the sugar melts, stirring to
  blend. Add 2 or 3 of the filled tortillas, depending on the size of
  the pan, and fry for 1 minute. Turn and fry on the other side until
  golden and slightly crisp, about 1 minute more.  Remove to a platter.
  Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon brown sugar.
  Continue cooking until all the chimichangas are done.
  
  5.  Spoon strawberry puree over one end of each chimichanga; spoon
  mango puree over the other.  Eat while still warm and crunchy.
  
  Variations:  Other than strawberries and mangos, you can use apricots;
  berries (boysenberry, blueberry, raspberry, mulberry); cherries;
  guavas; mandarin oranges or other oranges and tangerines; pineapple;
  and peaches. Fruits that are mellow (pear, apple, papaya) don't
  provide the needed contrast.  The fruit puree can be embellished with
  a dash of: brandy, cassis, grenadine, kirsch and Triple Sec.

 Categories: Breads, Christmas
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Bread or unbleached flour*
           *More flour may be necessary
      1 c  Warm milk (105F-to-115F)
      1 pk Active dry yeast
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1    Egg; at room temperature
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Butter; at room temperature
    1/2 c  Glaceed cherries
    1/2 c  Chopped mixed candied fruit
    1/2 c  Date bits
    1/2 c  Coarsely chopped walnuts
           -or pecans

MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
      1    Egg; beaten, mixed with
      1 ts Milk or water

MMMMM-------------------------DECORATION------------------------------
      7    Halves of glaceed cherries
      7    Walnut or pecan halves

MMMMM---------------------------ICING--------------------------------
    1/2 c  Confectioners' sugar
    1/2 tb Vegetable oil
    1/4 ts Almond extract
           Water
 
  This festive bread is perfect for gifts. The recipe can be doubled and
  freezes well for up to 2 months. A fermented yeast "starter" gives
  this bread a full flavor, but you can omit the process if you're in a
  hurry.
  
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. In a food processor or mixer bowl, mix 1 cup of
  the flour, the warm milk, yeast and sugar. If time allows, cover the
  bowl with plastic wrap and leave the dough at room temperature to
  ferment and bubble for 2 hours. If time does not allow, proceed to
  add the egg, salt and butter. Add the rest of the flour, 1/2 cup at a
  time, to make a soft dough. Knead the dough in the food processor,
  mixer or on a floured board until elastic and smooth. Mix the
  cherries, candied fruit, dates and nuts together and fold and knead
  1/3 of the mixture at a time into the dough until well mixed. Place
  in an oiled plastic bag or oiled bowl. Turn to coat. Seal or cover
  and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 3/4 to 1 hour.
  Punch down. Knead briefly. Grease a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan. Form the
  dough into an oval approximately the length of the pan, and place in
  pan. Let rise again until doubled. Brush the loaves with the egg
  glaze. Bake on the middle shelf about 40-to-50 minutes until nicely
  browned. Cover with foil if the loaf browns too rapidly. Cool on a
  wire rack. TO MAKE ICING, mix confectioners' sugar, oil, almond
  extract and enough water to make a smooth consistency. Brush cooled
  bread with icing. Top with the candied cherries and nuts. Makes 2
  Loaves

      Title: SWEET INDIAN LEMON PICKLES
 Categories: Indian, Condiments, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      9    Lemons
      4 tb Coarse or kosher salt
  1 1/2 tb Cumin seeds,toasted, ground
      1 tb Coarsely ground black pepper
      3 c  Sugar
      2 tb Seedless raisins
      8    Dried, hot red peppers
 
  This is remarkably similar to the Moroccan Salted Lemon recipe that
  I'm looking for, except that it uses sugar instead of salt. Adapted
  from Julie Sahni's "Classic Indian Cooking."
  
  Wash the lemons in cold water and dry thoroughly.
  
  Quarter 6 of the lemons from the top almost all the way through to the
  bottom, leaving about 1/2 inch so they'll hold together. Squeeze the
  juice from the other lemons.
  
  Mix the salt, cumin and black pepper in a small dish, and mix
  thoroughly with the lemons, Stuff the lemons into a quart jar and
  pour in the lemon juice.
  
  Cover with cheesecloth to prevent dirt from getting in the jar, and
  let sit in the open for about 1 week.
  
  On the 7th day, pour the juices from the jar into an enamel or
  stainless steel pan, add the sugar and cook over low heat, stirring,
  until the sugar dissolves. Add the lemons and cook, stirring gently,
  for 8 minutes or so. Stir in the raisins and peppers.  Put the lemons
  in a sterilized jar and seal with the lid. Let sit for a week or so
  before eating. Use like you would any pickle, as an accompaniment.

  until blended, then beat in egg.  Sift together flour, baking powder,
  salt, and nutmeg. Stir dry ingredients into butter mixture
  alternately with milk, blending well after each addition.   Spoon
  batter into greased 1 1/2" muffin cups, filling 2/3 to 3/4 full. Bake
  in a 375 oven until golden grown (12-18 minutes). Remove from pans.
  While muffins are still hot, dip each into melted butter, coating
  evenly; then roll in cinnamon-sugar mixture. Place on a plate and let
  cool completely. Wrap airtight; store at room temp for up to 1 day,
  in freezer for up to 1 month (thaw forzen muffins unwrapped).  On
  gift tag, suggest reheating muffins before serving: arrange on a
  baking sheet, cover loosely with foil, and heat in a 350 oven for
  about 10 min.  Makes 3 dozen mini-muffins. I have made these as full
  size muffins many times for breakfast and they're always a hit.
   Hope you like them!

  Notes and Credits To retain maximum crunch, this relish is not
  heat-sterilized, so it must be kept refrigerated.
  
  If you are looking for the sweetest onion, always select the flattest
  shape. The more rounded or globular it is, the hotter it generally is.
  
  Sometimes the tops of the onions almost seem to be slightly depressed
  in the center. They will have the thickest layers and the sweetest
  flavor.

  Notes and Credits To retain maximum crunch, this relish is not
  heat-sterilized, so it must be kept refrigerated.
  
  If you are looking for the sweetest onion, always select the flattest
  shape. The more rounded or globular it is, the hotter it generally is.
  
  Sometimes the tops of the onions almost seem to be slightly depressed
  in the center. They will have the thickest layers and the sweetest
  flavor.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 tb Oil, vegetable
      1 md Onion, sliced
      1 c  Veal, trimmings * OR

  For Sweet Onion Sauce: ======================
  
       In a heavy saucepan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat,
  then add onion and meat.  Cook uncovered, shaking the pan and
  stirring occasionally, until the meat and the onion are browned
  (about 20 minutes.)
  
       Add the vermouth, stirring, to the meat and onions. Then add the
  stock and bring the mixture to a boil. Allow the mixture to boil
  gently, skimming the surface often until sauce has reduced to a light
  syrupy consistency (about 30 minutes or longer.)
  
       Remove the saucepan from the heat and swirl in 2 tablespoons of
  butter, bit by bit.  Strain the resulting sauce and season with a
  little bit salt and pepper.
       Warm the sauce.  Spoon some sauce around the crepes, and serve.

      Title: SWEET PASTRY
 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  Flour
    1/4 c  Sugar; granulated
  3 1/2 oz Butter; unsalted
           -well chilled
      1 ts Lemon zest; opt
      1    Egg
 
    can use 7 Tbsp of butter
    This pastry is very sticky because of the high fat content, best
  made in the food processor. Roll the chilled pieces of butter in the
  flour to help reduce the stickiness. Roll it out on two pieces of
  Saran wrap, lift the wrap to transfer in the flan pan and peel off.
  This pastry is forgiving (can be patched) and is important for Lemon
  Tart as a flavour contrast.
   Put flour and sugar in food processor bowl and pulse 1-2 times to
  aerate. Roll cubes off butter in flour and distribute over flour &
  sugar in work bowl. Process briefly till mixture reassembles fine
  meal. Drop egg down chute while processor is going. Process briefly
  till egg is incorporated. Turn on on Saran Wrap covered surface and
  form into ball. Refrigerate for at least an hour. Roll out on Saran
  Wrap covered surface. (You may add extra flour although it will
  toughen it slightly.) Roll to thickness 1/8" and 3" larger in
  diameter than flan tin. Transfer carefully, trim edges and put in
  fridge for at least an hour. Preheat oven to 375F oven. When it is at
  the right temperature, put pastry lined tin in centre and bake 15
  minutes. If browning too much, turn oven down to 325F. Remove form
  oven and allow to cool before removing from oven.

 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
     10 oz Frozen peas (not tiny ones)
      1    Jalape¤o pepper
    1/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
      2 ts Fresh lemon juice
    1/4 ts Ground cumin
    1/4 ts Salt
           1-inch square of red onion
 
  Cook peas according to package instructions.  For this recipe, the
  larger peas work better than the tiny peas. Drain cooked peas and pat
  with paper towelling to remove as much water as possible. If you want
  less "heat" in the guacamole, seed the pepper and discard the seeds.
  Mince the pepper in a food processor or blender. Add oil and 1 1/2
  teaspoons lemon juice, and let machine run until the pepper is more
  finely minced. Add peas, cumin, and salt, and puree about 2 minutes,
  stopping several times to scrape down the sides of the container.
  Transfer the puree to a small bowl. Cut the onion into a small dice
  and add to the mixture. Adjust the seasoning with additional lemon
  juice or salt if necessary. Cover tightly and chill thoroughly up to
  2 days before serving.

      Title: SWEET PICKLED CAULIFLOWER
 Categories: Relishes, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lg Cauliflower
           - about 2 lbs., trimmed wt.
      2 oz Salt
      1 pt Water
      8 oz Onions
      1 lb Sugar
      1 pt Wine vinegar
      1 tb Mustard seed
      2    Short pieces cinnamon bark
    1/2 ts Cloves
    1/2 ts Allspice
      3    Little dried red peppers
 
  Trim the cauliflower and divide it into florets. Blanch the florets in
  boiling salted water for 5 minutes. Drain them and run cold water
  through them immediately. Slice the onions and layer them with
  cauliflower into sterilized jars.  Heat the vinegar with the sugar
  and spices, and pour the boiling mixture into the jars. The florets
  should be submerged. Cover and seal while hot.  Ready to eat in a
  week, the pickle will keep in a cool place all year. Makes
  approximately 3 lb. pickle.
  
  Suggestions: Make an oeuf en cocette, very lightly cooked with a
  teaspoon of cream and serve it on a plate along with pickled
  cauliflower, sticks of cucumber, spring onions, and matchsticks of
  celery to dip into it.
  
  Toss a few cauliflower florets with a haricot bean salad dressed with
  olive oil, some of the pickling liquor, chopped garlic and parsley.
  
  Serve them as part of an antipasto with olives and slices of salad.

  NOTES:
  
  *  Sweet potatoes, carrots and cranberries in cream cheese quiche --
  This recipe has become a real holiday favorite in our family. It is
  originally from "The Vegetarian Epicure, Book Two" by Anna Thomas. It
  is sweeter than most quiches, but not as sweet as most pies, and can
  be eaten either as a side dish, or as dessert. We usually eat it with
  the turkey because no one wants to wait until dessert time!
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  25 minutes preparation, 40 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      1 tb Active dry yeast
      2 tb Sugar
      2 tb Dry milk; nonfat
      1 tb Fresh gingerroot; grated
      1 ts Orange rind; grated
      1 ts Coarse salt
    1/8 ts Nutmeg; grated
      2 tb Butter; soft
    3/4 c  Sweet potato; mashed
  3 1/2 c  Flour; all-purpose
      1    Egg; beaten w/ 1 tsp water
           Sesame seeds
 
  In a medium-size bowl dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup of lukewarm water.
  Combine the sugar and dry milk with 1 cup of warm water and add to the
  yeast along with the grated ginger, orange rind, salt, and nutmeg.
  Whip the butter into the mashed potatoes and combine with yeast
  mixture. Stir the flour in and then beat the mixture for 1 minute.
  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place over a pan of warm water
  to rise until double in volume, about 45 minutes.
  
  Tum out onto a floured work surface, punch down, and knead very
  lightly a few turns. Pull off pieces of dough slightly smaller than a
  Ping-Pong ball and, since they will be very sticky, just roll lightly
  with floured hands to form a ball. Arrange on one or two greased
  baking sheets large enough to hold the three dozen rolls side by side
  without crowding. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise in a warm
  place for 30 minutes. Paint with the beaten egg and sprinkle sesame
  seeds on top. Bake in a preheated 350-degree oven for
       25    minutes. Serve warm.

      Title: SWEET POTATO PIE (CEIDEBURG 2)
 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 lg Sweet potatoes
      4 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Light brown sugar
    1/2 c  Milk
      3    Eggs, separated
    1/4 ts Salt, or to taste
    1/8 ts Grated nutmeg, or to taste
    1/2 ts Cinnamon, or to taste
    1/4 ts Ground cloves, or to taste
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
           Prepared pie crust (see
           -below)

MMMMM------------------------FLAKY PASTRY-----------------------------
      2 c  Flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Cold lard or vegetable
           -shortening and
           Cold butter or margarine
      3    To 5 tablespoons cold water
 
  In this very accommodating pie, the amount of sweet potato used need
  not be exact.
  
  1.  Preheat oven to 375F.  Pare sweet potato, cut in half lengthwise,
  then cut each piece once crosswise, and drop into boiling water to
  cover. Boil until tender (15 to 20 minutes). Meanwhile, cut butter in
  small chunks and place in a medium mixing bowl with sugar.
  
  2.  Drain sweet potato and quickly mash with butter and sugar. While
  mixture is still hot, beat until smooth. Beat in milk and egg yolks.
  Add salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and vanilla; carefully adjust
  spicing to taste.
  
  3.  Using an electric mixer with clean, dry beaters, beat egg whites
  in a small bowl until stiff.  Gently fold beaten whites into sweet
  potatoes. Pour mixture into pie crust, place on a baking sheet, and
  bake for 40 minutes.  Lower heat to 350F and bake until top is medium
  brown and crust is golden brown (an additional 5 to 10 minutes).
  Serve at room temperature or chilled.
  
  Serves 8.
  
  VARIATION:  For the more familiar, heavier pie filling, omit milk,
  and beat whole, unseparated eggs into the sweet potato mixture. Bake
  at 375F for 40 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.
  
  FLAKY PASTRY:
  
  1.  In a large bowl mix flour and salt.  Using a pastry blender or 2
  knives, cut in lard and butter until mixture is crumbly and particles
  are the size of small dried peas.
  
  2.  Mixing lightly with a fork, sprinkle on water, 1 tablespoon at a
  time, until dough begins to cling together. With your hands press
  dough into 2 flattened balls of equal size.  Enclose in plastic wrap
  to prevent dough from drying out while preparing filling. To avoid
  stickiness, refrigerate for up to a day.
  
  3.  Roll out on a lightly floured surface, using short, firm strokes
  to achieve uniform thinness, according to recipe directions.
  
  Makes two 9-inch pie crusts.
  
  NOTE:  To prepare in food processor, combine flour and salt in work
  bowl. Add lard and butter.  Process, using short on-off bursts, until
  coarse crumbs form. Add water through feed tube, 1 tablespoon at a
  time, processing until mixture barely clings together.  Use your
  hands to press pastry together into 2 smooth balls.

      1 c  Brown sugar (granulated)
      1 ts Cinnamon
      1 ts Nutmeg
    1/4 ts Allspice
    1/2 ts Vanilla
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Evaporated skim milk or
           Lowfat sweetened condensed
           Milk

MMMMM----------------------PHYLLO PIE CRUST---------------------------
      4 ts Sugar (optional)
      1    Box Phyllo dough

MMMMM----------------------OPTIONAL TOPPING---------------------------
      1 c  Chopped roasted chestnuts
           Cinnamon
 
  Preheat oven to 425.  Lightly spray 2 pie pans with nonstick cooking
  spray.
  
  FILLING: I used a pressure cooker to cook the sweet potatoes until
  very soft  and not stringy.
  
  Mash very well.  (I used a regular mixer)
  
  Combine sugar, spices in a little bowl. Last add vanilla with the
  spices and then mix into the potatoes.
  
  Now , beat your egg whites and mix it in with the potato mixture.
  Slowly mix in your evaporated skim milk and set aside.
  
  CRUST * I took out the entire stack of phyllo sheets from the box.
  Turned my pie pans over and cut the entire stack to the appx.
  circumference of the pan so I had a stack of circular dough.
  
  Quickly, (dough dries out very fast and sticks together) layer 1 or 2
  sheets of phyllo on each of the pans, spray very LIGHTLY with
  non-stick cooking spray and sprinkle with sugar and repeat until
  crust is the thickness you desire. (For 2 pies I used all the phyllo
  dough in the box) I moistened my fingers to seal the edge of the
  crust and crimp as with a "normal" crust.
  
  Cover edges of crust loosely with foil.
  
  Pour filling into the phyllo crust.   Sprinkle chopped chestnuts and
  cinnamon on top if desired.
  
  Bake for 15 minutes at 425. Reduce temperature to 350 and bake for
  about 30 minutes more.
  
  Enjoy, all my SAD relatives loved it! (Before they would eat it the
  asked me "is this a REAL sweet potato pie, you know what we mean" to
  which I answered "but of course!")

  Omar the Pieman has been vending pies since 1964 after he left
  sailing the high seas as a merchant marine. He and his wife,
  Haneefah, decided to provide for their family in a traditional way by
  baking delicious homemade pies and cakes.
  
  In August of 1964 Omar left on his first route through the historic
  streets of New Orleans' French Quarter. As he went along shouting,
  "Pieman, pieman ... delicious, fresh-baked pies," his outgoing and
  friendly character, as well as his pies, became known and enjoyed by
  French Quarter residents.
  
  In his 20 years of business, Omar the Pieman, has been vending in the
  French Quarter, at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, the
  Bastille Celebration and now finally from his own little "home, sweet
  home" kitchen in The Marketplace. Throughout the week from 9:30 to
  5:30 his son, Omar Ibn, delivers trays of velvety smooth pies baked
  daily by his mother, Haneefah (the lady behind the scenes). She was
  once quoted, "I won't let one pie out of my sight unless the crust
  melts in my mouth and the fillings are at their best."
  
  Taken from the sadly out-of-print New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival
  Cookbook, copyright 1984. Mix the potatoes with rotary beater until
  they are smooth. Then add the other ingredients to the potatoes and
  beat for 5 minutes. Pour filling into unbaked 9" pie shell, bake for
  40-45 minutes at 350-325. Can also be served with a favorite topping:
  hot rum sauce, ice cream or whipped cream. Walt MM Omar At The Market

      Title: SWEET POTATO STEAKS
 Categories: Vegetarian, Digest
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 x  Sweet potatoes
 
  This is really great.  Michelle was the first one to mention this
  last year so she gets full credit (yeah, she's also pretty busy these
  days) Slice sweet potatoes the long way into around 1/4" (1 cm?)
  slices. Brush with steak sauce - Lea & Perrins is vegan. Trader Joe's
  too. Let sit for a little while
  
  Place on BBQ (Turn once)
  
  The potatoes get that wonderful grill pattern on them too!
  
  Buy potatoes that are straight and plump.  I've done this with both
  orange and yellow flesh varietes with good success. You may even be
  able to use regular potatoes...

      Title: SWEET POTATO WHIP
 Categories: Digest, Mar95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     12    Sweet potatoes (pricked all
           Over with a fork)
    1/2 c  Nonfat plain yogurt
      4 c  Defatted chicken broth
           Substitute
  2 1/4 lb Carrots
           Cinnamon or mace to taste
           (1/4 tsp)
           Salt and pepper to taste
           (optional)
 
  Bake the sweet potatoes at 375 for 1.25 hrs or until soft. Let them
  cool to room temperature.
  
  Cook the carrots in the broth until tender 20 to 25 minutes Reserve
  1/2 c of broth.
  
  Scoop out the inside of the cooled potatoes into a large bowl add the
  carrots, 1/2 c of broth, yogurt and cinnamon.
  
  Mash together and then put 1/2 in a food processor then do the other
  half. Mix together.
  
  Put in the oven for 15 minutes at 375 before serving.
  
  COMMENTS: The carrots help alleviate the sweetness of the potatoes.
  
  The food processor is not necessary if you have a good potato masher
  and the  carrots are tender enough.
  
  This was a great dish to prepare the night before. Except that before
  serving you would need to put it in the oven for 30 minutes instead
  of 15 minutes.

 Categories: Digest, Jan.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    Good sized sweet potatoes
           Equal bulk in parsnips
      1 ts Cumin
 
  Peel sweet potatoes and parsnips, cut into chunks, and cook in water
  until soft.  A pressure cooker speeds this up. Drain, puree in food
  processor. Mix the puree and cumin and put in a casserole dish. Allow
  to sit for 15 minutes for cumin flavor to develop, mix again, serve.
  
  I subbed the cumin for a T of sesame tahini, which can also be subbed
  for with a few drops of sesame oil if you can afford it. I believe
  the cff would stay below 10%.
  
  Oh, and the water from cooking makes a good start on soup the next
  day.

      Title: SWEET RED PEPPER RELISH
 Categories: Relishes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4    Very lge. red peppers,>>>>
           Seeded & chopped (4 cups)
      2 tb Coarse (kosher) salt
  1 1/2 c  White wine vinegar
  2 1/2 c  Sugar
      1 ts Mustard seeds, slightly>>>>
           Crushed OR>>>>>>>>>
    1/4 ts Fennel seeds
 
  Mix chopped red peppers and salt and let stand overnight in a ceramic,
  stainless-steel or enameled container, refrigerated.
  
  Drain off and discard the liquid and put the peppers into a stainless
  or enameled pot with the vinegar, sugar and mustard (or fennel)
  seeds. Bring to boil, then lower heat to med. and cook, stirring
  occasionally, until the peppers are translucent and the relish is the
  consistency of marmalade, but syrupy. (If relish begins to thicken
  too much before the peppers are translucent, cover pot and lower heat
  for a few minutes while the peppers complete the necessary cooking
  without too much evaporation.) Don't overcook, or a too-stiff relish
  will result.
  
  Prepare 4 half-pint canning jars with 2 pc. screw-on lids, and ladle
  relish into each, leaving 1/2" headroom. Process in boiling water to
  cover jars by 2" for 10 minutes.
  
  Remove jars and cool.  Ready for use immediately.

      Title: SWEET RISOTTO WITH EXOTIC BANANAS
 Categories: Desserts, Low fat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Arborio rice
      3    Exotic ripe bananas (about
  1 1/3 lb Total weight), peeled and
           Chopped
    1/4 c  Brown sugar
      3 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Creme de cacao liqueur
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
 
  Sprinkle about a third of the rice in the bottom of a 2-quart
  casserole dish.  Then sprinkle on a third of the bananas and a third
  of the sugar on top of them. Continue sprinkling in thirds until
  you're done. Pour on the milk and creme de cacao and sprinkle with
  cinnamon. Cover and bake in a 375 degree pre-heated oven until the
  liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender, about 1 hour.  Serve
  warm.
  
  We discovered that it also tastes good cold, standing in front of the
  refrigerator :-)
  
  You can substitute skim milk or evaporated skim milk instead of whole
  milk. Also, if exotic bananas aren't available, substitute regular
  ones. I used evaporated skim milk, regular bananas, and I think I
  left out the liqueur. Arborio is the short-grained Italian rice
  traditionally used for risotto. My regular supermarket does carry it.
  Perhaps another kind of rice would work.

  "Toward the end of our Odyssey as escapees from the Nazis, my two
  brother, my sister and myself made a stop at a farm with the usual
  trepidation; would they give us shelter or turn us into the Fascists?
  They welcomed us. One of the their children was celebrating First
  Communion and they were delighted to share the happy event with us.
  In fact,as if we were part of the family, we helped in the
  preparations. They had very little sugar, which they had saved from
  before the war and asked us to make one of our desserts with it. It
  was near Shavout and we thought of Tortelli Dolci. Some of the
  ingredients were missing, but they were delicious to anyway or so it
  seemed to us at the time."
  
  Combine the citron with 1 egg yolk, 3 Tbsp sugar, citron peel, pine
  nuts and vanilla extract; mix well and set aside in refrigerator.
  Make a soft dough with the flour, salt, eggs, the remaining egg yolk,
  1/4 cup sugar, vegetable oil, rum and lemon extract. Knead for 3
  minutes, then cover with a clean towel and let rest for five minutes.
  With a rolling pin, roll very thin. With a cookie cutter or with a
  glass, cut into disks, about 3 inches in diameter. Place 1 Tbsp of
  the ricotta mixture over each disk. Fold each disk in half and press
  the round edge with a fork to seal. Place on an ungreased baking

      Title: SWEET SPINACH TART
 Categories: Pies, Desserts, Vegetables
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           8-inch unbaked pie pastry
           -shell
  2 1/2 lb Fresh spinach
    1/4 c  White wine
    1/2 c  Rose water
    1/3 c  Sugar (or more)
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
        pn Salt (generous)
           Sliced strawberries and
           -confectioners' sugar for
           -topping
 
  A Spinnage Tart--Take good store of Spinage, and boyl it in a Pipkin,
  with White-Wine, till it be very soft as pap: then take it and strain
  it well into a pewter dish, not leaving any part unstrained: then put
  to it Rose-water, great store of Sugar and cinamon, and boyl it till
  it be as thick as Marmalad.  Then let it coole, and after fill your
  Coffin and adorn it....--Gervase Markham, The English Hous-wife
  
  Spinach "was held in special regard because it had reached the western
  world much later than the other greenstuff of medieval cookery,"
  comments C. Anne Wilson in Food and Drink in Britain. "It came from
  Persia, through the Arabs, and was first recorded in the west by St.
  Thomas Aquinas. It arrived too late to acquire any traditional
  medicinal merits."
  
  Here the Elizabethans treat spinach as a fruit, and with great
  success. It is fascinating to note how serendipity thrives among
  cooks who have no preconceived notions about the "proper" use of a
  particular food.
  
  1.  Bake pie shell at 425F for 10 minutes.  Reduce temperature to
  350F and bake for an additional 35 minutes or until done. Let cool.
  2. Wash and trim spinach.  Put spinach directly into large enameled
  or aluminum pot without draining.  Add wine. 3. Cover and steam
  spinach over medium flame for 1-2 minutes or until spinach is wilted.
  4. Drain spinach and mince very fine. 5. In the same pot, combine
  rose water, sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Bring to a boil, stirring to
  dissolve sugar. 6. Add chopped spinach and stir to coat. 7. Simmer
  over very low flame, stirring occasionally, until all liquid
  evaporates. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. 8. Fill pie shell
  with spinach mixture. Arrange sliced strawberries decoratively on
  top. 9. Chill at least 2 hours. 10. Just before serving, sprinkle
  lightly with confectioners' sugar.

      Title: SWEET SQUASH SOUP
 Categories: Digest, Mcdougall
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lg Butternut or Buttercup
           -Squash
  1 1/2 c  Sliced onion
  1 1/2 c  Peeled and chopped apple
      1 c  Chopped carrot
      2    To 3 teaspoons minced fresh
           -ginger
      5 c  Water
 
  Put the whole squash in a microwave oven and cook on high power for 8
  minutes.  Peel the squash and cut into cubes. (If you don't have a
  microwave oven, this step may be omitted. This brief cooking time
  simply makes the squash easier to peel and cut up.)  Place all of the
  ingredients in a large soup pot and simmer over medium-low heat for
  45 minutes. Place the soup in a blender or food processor, in
  batches, and blend until smooth and creamy.
  
  It's straight out of the New McDougall Cookbook, but you may have just
  flipped past it, as I did many times. It's definitely worth making.
  It's slightly sweet and the ginger subtlety blends with the other
  flavors. The only possible modification I'd make is to use less
  water. I ended up dumping some of the liquid (maybe 2 cups) after the
  soup had simmered, and then blended it. The result was very creamy
  and very delicious.

      Title: SWEET YAMS N SQUASH (VEGAN)
 Categories: Digest, Nov.
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Squash
      4    Sweet potatoes
    1/4 c  Orange juice
      1    Dollop of maple syrup
      1    Dollop of honey or molasses
        x  Sweet spices to taste-
           Cinnamon, ginger, cardamom,
           Etc
 
  Heat oven to 350F.  Lightly spray a big-enough Pyrex pan with Pam.
  
  Trim ends of squash, cut in half lengthwise, clean out seeds, and lay
  flat sides down in pan.  Peel sweet potatoes (hey, it's up to you!)
  and lay in pan.  Bake in oven until both are done. (Check after 30
  minutes, then keep checking at reasonable intervals.) "Done" = as
  soft as you like them.
  
  Remove the cooked veggies from the oven, cut them into bite-sized
  slices and chunks, and arrange them in a serving dish.
  
  Separately, combine the liquids and sweet spices. Pour over the warm
  veggies.  (There could be lots of variations on the liquids and
  spices to achieve different kinds of flavors. This was the combo that
  I used.)
  
  Either serve immediately, or refrigerate (covered). Can be reheated
  in a regular or microwave oven.
  
  This yielded one medium-sized casserole full. Probably "serves 6" as
  part of a normal meal rather than a big office lunch.

      Title: SWEET YEAST CRISPS
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
    1/3 c  Warm water
      1 pk Active dry yeast
      1 c  Lightly salted butter or
           -margarine, at room
           Temperature
    1/8 ts Salt
      2 c  All-purpose flour, sifted
           -before measuring
    3/4    To 1 cup granulated sugar
 
  Combine the water and yeast in a small bowl; let stand for 2 minutes.
  In a large mixer bowl, beat the butter and salt until creamy. Add the
  flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. (This can
  be done with an electric mixer at low speed.) Stir in the yeast
  mixture. Cover the mixture and chill for 1 hour.
  
  Place 3/4 cup of granulated sugar in a pie plate or shallow pan. Drop
  level tablespoons of the chilled dough into the sugar. Roll each
  tablespoon into a ball and coat well with sugar. Place the
  sugar-coated balls in a shallow pan and chill for 30 minutes.
  
  Heat the oven to 375F.  On a well-sugared board, working with one
  ball at a time, press additional sugar into the dough while you pat
  the ball into a square.  Using a sugared rolling pin, roll each piece
  of dough into a square about 3 x 3 inches.  Cut each square
  diagonally into two triangles. With a metal spatula, lift the
  triangles onto an ungreased baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining
  balls of dough.
  
  Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned. Let the crisps
  rest on the baking sheet for 30 seconds before removing them to wire
  racks to cool completely.
  
  The crisps taste best when fresh, but can be stored in an air- tight
  container.
  
  Makes about 5 1/2 dozen wafers.

  1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
    1/8 ts Vanilla
      1 tb Butter
      1 tb Lemon juice
 
    1-2 tb warm water
  
  SWEET YEAST DOUGH Note: All-purpose flour can be substituted for wheat
  flour and germ, in roughly the same quantity--then you can skip the
  step of combining them in a separate bowl.
  
  Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in a small bowl, stir, and let
  stand until soft, about 5 minutes. Reserve.
  
  In a large bowl, combine eggs, sugar, salt, baking soda, buttermilk,
  and butter, and beat till smooth. Stir in reserved yeast. In a
  separate bowl, combine the flours and wheat germ. Then add 3 cups of
  the dry mixture to the wet ingredients, beating until well blended.
  Add 2 more cups of the dry ingredients and beat until the dough just
  holds together. Turn out onto a lightly floured board and knead for 1
  minute. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Knead the dough again,
  sprinkling on the remainder of the flour mixture as needed, until
  smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turn,
  cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place until about
  doubled in bulk, about 60 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile make the FILLING 	Combine all ingredients, reserve
  
  And the GLAZE STICKY PECAN GLAZE Combine the butter, brown sugar and
  corn syrup in a bowl and beat till well mixed. Spread evenly over the
  bottom of a buttered 10 x 15-inch baking pan. Sprinkle evenly with
  the pecans and set aside.
  
  MAKING STICKY PECAN BUNS Punch the risen dough down and turn it out
  onto a lightly floured surface. Roll out into a 15x24-inch rectangle
  about 1/2-inch thick. Sprinkle the reserved filling over the dough,
  gently pressing the mixture into the dough with your fingers.
  Beginning with the short end, roll the dough up like a jelly roll.
  Slice crosswise into 12 equal pieces. Place the slices, cut side down
  and barely touching each other, on top of the glaze in the pan.
  Cover, and let rise in a warm place until puffy and almost doubled in
  bulk, about 25 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bake the
  buns until golden brown on top, 25-30 minutes. Remove from the oven
  and cool in the pan to set the glaze, about 5 minutes. Invert onto a
  serving tray or another baking sheet and allow the glaze to dribble
  down the sides. Pull apart and serve warm.
  
  IF YOU WANT CINNAMON ROLLS If you want cinnamon rolls, roll the dough
  into the same 15x25-inch rectangle, brush with melted butter and
  sprinkle the following filling over it, pressing in lightly with
  fingers.
  
  FILLING FOR CINNAMON ROLLS Mix thoroughly. Preheat the oven to 375

 Categories: Oriental, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    3/4 lb Chicken breast
           - skinless, boneless
      1 tb Rice wine or dry sherry
      1 tb Light soy sauce
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 sm Green bell pepper
      1 sm Red bell pepper
      1    Carrot
      2    Scallions
      1    Egg; beaten
      2 tb Cornstarch
      2 c  Oil, preferably peanut
      3 oz Canned lychees; drained -OR-
      1    -fresh orange in segments

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
    2/3 c  Chicken stock
      1 tb Light soy sauce
    1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 tb Chinese white rice vinegar
           -=OR=- Cider vinegar
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Tomato paste
      1 ts Cornstarch
      1 ts Water
 
  CUT THE CHICKEN INTO 1-INCH cubes. Put the cubes into a bowl together
  with the rice wine or sherry, 1 tablespoon of light soy sauce and 1/2
  teaspoon salt, and marinate for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the green
  and red peppers into 1-inch squares. Peel and cut the carrots and
  scallions into 1-inch chunks. (The uniform size of meat and
  vegetables adds to the visual appeal of the dish.) Bring a pot of
  water to a boil and blanch the carrots in it for 4 minutes, then
  drain and set aside. Mix the egg and cornstarch in a bowl until they
  are well blended into a batter. Lift the chicken cubes out of the
  marinade, put them into a batter and coat each piece well. Heat the
  oil in a deep-fat fryer or large wok until it is almost smoking.
  Remove the chicken pieces from the batter with a slotted spoon and
  deep-fry them. Drain the deep-fried chicken cubes on paper towels.
  
  TO MAKE THE SAUCE: Combine the chicken stock, soy sauce, salt,
  vinegar, sugar and tomato paste in a large saucepan. Bring it to a
  boil. Add all the vegetables, but not the lychees or oranges, and
  stir well. In a small bowl, blend together the cornstarch and water.
  Stir this mixture into the sauce, and bring it back to a boil. Turn
  the heat down to a simmer. Add the lychees or oranges and chicken
  cubes. Mix well, then turn the mixture onto a deep platter. Serve at
  once.

      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      3 lb Firm, ripe red plums*
           -- pitted, in 1/2" chunks
    1/2 ts Peeled, crushed garlic
    1/2 lb Onions; peeled
           -- finely chopped**
      1 c  Rice wine or cider vinegar
    1/2 ts Dried crushed red pepper
      1 ts Ground coriander
    1/2 ts Ground allspice
  2 1/2 c  Sugar
 
  *Should yield about 2 quarts.  **Should yield about 1 cup.
  
  Place all ingredients except the sugar in a wide 4-quart saucepan and
  bring to boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Boil steadily
  for about 30 minutes.
  
  Remove from heat, put through food mill, and return pureed fruit to
  pan. Add sugar, place over medium heat, and stir constantly until
  mixture again boils. Boil steadily about 30 minutes, stirring often
  to prevent sticking; continue boiling about 15 minutes more, stirring
  constantly. Sauce is done when about 1/2 tsp. of it holds its shape
  on a chilled saucer. Spoon at once into hot, sterilized half-pint
  jars and seal. Store at least a week to mellow.
  
  Yield: About 5 1/2 cups.
  
  Lesem writes that her version is "...a fine dipping sauce not just for
  roast duck, but also barbecued spareribs. I also like to mix it with
  oil and vinegar to glaze spareribs or duckling during the last 20 to
  30 minutes of roasting or grilling."

           -Large Basil leaves
           -  shredded
 
  SLICE THE PEPPER INTO STRIPS 2- to 3-inches long and about 1/4-inch
  wide--or whatever width appeals to you. They can be very skinny, or
  nice and wide, too. Heat oil in a large skillet with the garlic. When
  it's hot, add the peppers, sprinkled with salt, and stir so that all
  are coated with the oil. Cook over a brisk heat, shaking the pan
  occasionally until the peppers are hot and beginning to cook, about 5
  minutes, then stir in the tomato paste. When it is well incorporated,
  add the vinegar and stir. Continue to saute until the vinegar is
  reduced and the peppers are as done as you like. They're good when
  still somewhat firm--perfect for a little salad--but they can also
  cook until they are very soft throughout-- good with pasta or heaped
  on garlic- rubbed grilled bread. Toss in the basil, season with
  pepper, and heap onto a serving plate.

  filling, avoiding edges of the crust. Place tarts on a baking sheet,
  transfer to oven, and bake for 25 to 35 minutes, until tarts are
  puffed and golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool 15 to 20
  minutes. Unmold and let cool to room teperature. Sprinkle the

           Chicken:
      1 lb Boneless chicken,1" cubed
      1 tb Xiaoxing rice wine
           Or dry sherry
      2 ts Regular soy sauce
    1/4 ts Salt

      2 ts Oil
      1    Garlic clove, minced
    1/2 ts Ginger root, minced
    1/4 c  Cider vinegar (or rice
           Vinegar or
           White vinegar)
    1/4 c  Chicken broth
    1/4 c  Dark brown sugar, packed
      3 tb Ketchup
      2 ts Soy sauce
    1/2 ts Orange peel, grated
           Vegetables:
      1    Green bell pepper,
           Cut into 3/4" squares
      1    Red bell pepper,
           Cut into 3/4" squares
      1 cn 8 oz pineapple chunks
      1 cn 8 to 11 oz lychee or
           Mandarin orange, drained
           Thickener:
      1 tb Cornstarch
      2 tb Water, cold
 
  Mix chicken, sherry, soy, and salt. Let sit for at least 30 min. Mix
  in beaten egg. Combine cornstarch and flour (this makes a coating that
  approximates water chestnut flour). Dredge chicken cubes in flour,
  shaking off excess. Let rest for a few minutes. Deep fry in hot oil
  (360) for 2 (for white meat) to 3 (for dark meat) min. Drain on paper
  towels and keep warm.
  
  Saute ginger and garlic in oil over high heat. Add rest of sauce
  ingredients. Add peppers and stir-cook for 1 min. Add pineapple and
  lychee/orange. Raise heat to high high. Mix cornstarch with water and
  mix in. Taste now for seasoning - if it needs a little sugar,
  vinegar, or salt, add that now. When sauce thickens and turns glossy,
  it is ready.
  
  MEANWHILE, reheat the kettle of oil to high (375) and refry the
  chicken for 2 min or until it's golden and crispy on the outside.
  
  Add chicken to sauce and vegetables, toss, and serve with white rice.

      Title: SWEET-SOUR CUCUMBER SALAD
 Categories: Digest, July
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    Cucumbers
    1/3 c  Salt
    1/3 c  White vinegar
 
  You take the cukes, peel them and then thinly slice them on a grater
  or a Mouli.  Layer these in a colander and sprinkle salt on each
  layer. Let these sit at least 1/2 hour so they wilt. Thoroughly wash
  off the salt. Meanwhile, mix white vinegar in about equal proportions
  with sugar. Toss the cucumbers with this and chill. You may need to
  adjust the ratio to your personal taste.
  
  For a salad of 3 cucumbers, I'd maybe use 1/4- 1/3 c. each of vinegar
  and sugar.
  
  You could add dill seed to this, but I prefer it plain.

      Title: SWEETBREADS (ANIMELLA DI VITELLO)
 Categories: Italian, Veal, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Free Flow Recipe
 
  I was looking through an Italian cookbook for an Alfredo sauce (no
  luck there) and ran across a section on sweetbreads. Here's a short
  run down on what they are, how to prepare them for cooking and three
  recipes. Veal sweetbreads are more tender and flavorful than any
  other variety and are the type most commonly found in American
  markets.
  
  Sweetbreads are very similar to brains in texture and flavor.
  However, they are somewhat less delicate, and the receive the same
  preliminary preparation and generally the same cooking treatment. A
  whole sweetbread is the thymus gland of the animal and consists of 2
  nodules, or lobes, of which the more rounded is the tenderest and
  best part. This choicer lobe is sometimes available separately,
  although it is more expensive.
  
  If sweetbreads are to be sauteed or broiled, first soak them in
  several changes of cold water for 2 hours. Drain and carefully remove
  as much as possible of th membrane that covers them, being careful
  not to dig into the tender flesh.  Soak them again in cold water
  acidulated with lemon juice or vinegar and again remove was much of
  the membrane as possible. Cut off the connective tubes and then
  blanch the sweetbreads over low heat for 15 minutes in lightly salted
  water acidulated with lemon juice (about 1 tablespoon of lemon juice
  to 1 quart of water). The water should be maintained at a point just
  below a simmer; do not boil. Drain and plunge them in cold water for
  5 to 10 minutes. They are now ready to be sliced and sauteed.
  
  Sauteing is the more popular method of cooking sweetbreads. If,
  however, they are to be braised, blanching them is not necessary.

  "SWEETENERS
  
    The amount of sweetener called for in a recipe may be altered to
  suit your own taste. if you like less sweetener, add less. A recipe
  can be made sweetener by reducing the amount of flour by about
  1/4-1/2 cup and adding the same amount of granulated or powdered
  sweetener. Maple syrup or other sweetener may be substituted for
  honey in most recipes from other books.
    Fruit concentrates may be used in place of honey or maple syrup, in
  about equal proportions.
    Regular fruit juice may be used as a sole sweetening agent in some
  recipes, with small variations in flavour. For example, if a recipe
  calls for 2 cups maple syrup and 1 1/2 cups nut milk, use 3 1/2 cups
  of a thick variety of peach or pear juice (other fruit juices are not
  sweet or as light coloured.) There will be a slight change in
  flavour. If a recipe using only fruit juice is not sweet enough,
  substitute 1/2 cup or so of one of the recipe's dry ingredients (like
  flour) with the same amount of natural powdered or granulated
  sweetener.
    When a recipe calls for a liquid sweetener, it is best to use maple
  syrup, fruit concentrate or natural liquid sweetener for the best
  flavour. if any other liquid sweeteners are used, the amount of
  sweetening must be increased. Some sweeteners, like molasses or
  sorghum, can greatly change the flavour of the recipe and must be
  experimented with."

      Title: SWISS CHEESE POTATO BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Yea, Cheese, Robin's col
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 c  Bread or all-purpose flour
      1 pk Dry yeast
      1 ts Sugar
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Instant potato flakes
  1 1/2 c  Hot water; 120-130 degrees
    1/2    Butter or margarine; melted
      2    Eggs
      4 oz Swiss cheese; coarsely grate
 
  Recipe by: Bernard Clayton - The Complete Book of Breads - Page 337
  Equipment:  One 8" tube pan (angel food, bundt, or guegelhupf),
  greased or Teflon; 1 baking sheet. By Hand or Mixer: Measure 1 1/2
  cups flour into a large mixing or mixer bowl and stir in the yeast,
  sugar, salt, potato flakes, and hot water. Beat by hand 30 strong
  strokes, or for 1 minute in the mixer. Add the melted butter or
  margarine, eggs, and Swiss cheese. Beat by hand 100 strokes, or for 2
  minutes with the mixer turned to high. Stop the mixer. Stir in the
  balance of the flour, 1/2 cup at a time, first with the spoon and
  then by hand, or with the mixer flat beater and then dough hook.  The
  dough will be a rough, shaggy mass that will clean the sides of the
  bowl. However, if it continues to be slack (wet), add small portions
  of flour. Kneading (8 minutes): Turn the dough onto a lightly floured
  work surface and knead with the rhythmic motion of push-turn-fold.
  Add light sprinkles of flour if necessary.  In the mixer, with the
  dough hook, the dough will completely clean the sides of the bowl and
  form a ball around the revolving hook. The dough will be smooth and
  elastic. Knead by hand or mixer for 8 minutes. First Rising (1 hour):
  Place the dough in a greased mixing bowl and pat with buttered or
  greased fingers. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and leave
  at room temperature until the dough has doubled in volume, about 1
  hour. (If prepared with a new fast-rising yeast and at the
  recommended higher temperatures, reduce the rising times by about
  half.) Shaping (6 minutes): Punch down the dough, turn it onto the
  floured work surface, and let it rest for 2 minutes. It can be shaped
  in one of two ways.  One is to roll it under your palms to about 20
  inches in length. Lay the length of dough in the prepared pan.
  Overlap the ends slightly and pinch together.  Or, flatten the ball
  of dough and, with your fingers, punch a hole in the center and widen
  this to slip over the tube. Either way, push the dough firmly into
  the bottom of the pan. Second rising (45 minutes):  Cover the pan
  with a length of foil or wax paper and let rise until the dough has
  doubled in volume, 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees 20
  minutes before baking. (If using a convection oven, reduce heat by 50
  degrees.)  Place the pan in the moderate oven. Bake until a metal
  skewer inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean and dry,
  about 45 minutes. Ten minutes before the baking is done, carefully
  turn the loaf out of the pan onto a baking sheet.
   Return to the oven.  This will give the loaf a lovely overall brown
  that it would not otherwise have.  But handle it carefully. It is
  fragile when hot.  Take the bread from the oven. Slide the loaf off
  the baking sheet onto a metal rack to cool before slicing.

      Title: SWISS FLAN
 Categories: Appetizers, Swedish
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1 c  Biscuit mix
      3 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Light cream
           FILLING:
      1    Onion, large, sliced or
           -chopped
      2 tb Butter
      2    Eggs, beaten
      2 c  Natural Gruyere cheese (1/2
           -lb), shredded
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  PASTRY:
  
  A Swiss cheese pie is called "flan." The pastry for this pie is
  sometimes closer to a rich biscuit dough, but in other versions a
  short pastry may be used. The word "flan" means different things in
  different countries; In Spain it is plain cramel custard, in France a
  fruit tart in pastry, in Switzerland a cheese custard in pastry. And
  sometimes Swiss Flan is made with onions and cheese in custard!
  
  TO MAKE THE PASTRY, chop butter into the biscuit mix, work in cream,
  and roll out on lightly floured board; or press into a 9 inch pie
  plate, fluting the edges. Chill while preparing filling.
  
  FOR THE FILLING, cook onion in butter until golden; cool slightly. Add
  eggs, cheese, and salt. Pour this mixture into pastry, and bake in
  oven preheated to 425 degrees F. (very hot) for 15 minutes; then
  reduce heat to 350 degrees F. (moderate) and continue baking 25 to 30
  minutes or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
  Serve warm as a luncheon entree to 4 to 6 persons, or cut into small
  wedges for appetizers. Makes 10 to 12 appetizers.
  
  VARIATIONS: Instead of this pastry, regular pie crust may be used. Or
  make pastry of 1 cup flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon
  salt, 1/3 cup butter, and 1 beaten egg. Do not attempt to roll out
  this butter-rich pastry; press it with your fingers into pie pan,
  fluting the edges.

      Title: SWISS MERINGUE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      5    Egg whites @ room temp
    1/4 ts Cream of tartar
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Vanilla
  1 1/4 c  Sugar
 
  Grease & flour 2 baking sheets.  Combine egg whites, cream of tartar,
  salt, & vanilla in a large bowl. Beat (at medium speed if a mixer is
  used) until egg whites hold soft peaks. Gradually add 3/4 cup sugar,
  a tablespoon at a time, beating continuously. Continue beating until
  meringue is very stiff and dull. It has been beaten enough when a
  bit, rubbed between thumb & finger, is no longer grainy.  The
  meringue should be stiff enough to hold it's shape when formed with a
  pastry tube. Gently fold in remaining sugar.
  
  Meringues should actually be dried rather than baked. Herein lies the
  secret of making meringues which are tender, delicate, and
  light-colored, rather than overly crisp, tough, and too dark to be
  either attractive or delicious.  The best meringues are baked by the
  following method:
  
  Set oven teperature at 200 degrees before beginning to beat the egg
  whites. After shaping the meringue mixture on baking sheets, place in
  the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Then turn off the oven heat. Allow
  the meringues to remain in the oven with the heat rurned off for at
  least 4-5 hours -- the longer the better. If your oven has a pilot
  light, the meringues will be ready a little sooner.  The meringues
  should be totally dry before removing them from the oven.  If you
  can, leave them in the oven overnight.
  
  For many of us, however, time is a factor.  If you can't take the
  time to bake meringues this slow, slow way, accept second best &
  simply bake them slowly, setting the oven temperature for 200 degrees
  or less if possible. At 200 degrees, meringue layers will need to
  bake for about 40 minutes; small meringues may take a little less
  time.
  
  Whatever method you use, it is important to prevent the meringues from
  coloring, since even a light tan color changes their texture and
  taste as well as their appearance.
  
  When thoroughly dry, meringues can be kept covered in a dry airy
  place (NOT in a tightly covered box) for several weeks.
  
  ALTERNATE MIXING METHOD by ELECTRIC BEATER
  
  Combine egg whites, cream of tartar, salt, 1/2 cup sugar and vanilla
  in large bowl.  Beat at high speed until egg whites hold peaks. Add
  1/2 cup sugar, all at once. Beat at high speed until mixture is very
  stiff and there are no grains of undisolved sugar. Fold in remaining
  sugar.
  
  To shape Swiss Meringue into layers and rounds follow directions given
  below.
  
  Grease and flour a large baking sheet.  Press the rim of a 9-inch
  layer cake pan or a 2-inch cooky cutter lightly into the flour on
  baking sheet to make guides. If Baking Pan Liner Paper is used, the
  guiding circles will have to be traced with a pencil.  Spread mixture
  within circles. OR: Fill a pastry bag fitted with a No.3 or 5 tube
  with prepared mixture. Starting in center of each circle, press out
  bater in a long, continuous, pencil-thick strip, curling it round &
  round until traced circle is completely filled in (spiral).  For best
  control, press out batter slowly, holding bag at least 1 inch away
  from sheet.
  
  Bake in a 325 degree oven, 25 minutes for small rounds, 35-40 minutes
  for 9-inch layers.

      Title: SWISS-STYLE ONION FLATBREAD
 Categories: Breads, Swedish
      Yield: 28 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Lightly salted butter
      4 c  Diced yellow onions (about 1
           -1/4 lbs)
  3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
  2 3/4 ts Salt
      1    To 1 1/4 cups cold water
 
  Chewy rounds of skillet-cooked bread with sauteed onions mixed into
  the dough are good as a snack or as a savory accompaniment for soup,
  salad or cheese.
  
  Makes abut 28 rounds
  
  *1/4  lb slab bacon
  
  1.  Heat butter in medium skillet over high heat until hot; reduce
  heat to medium-high.  Add onions; saute, stirring occasionally, until
  soft but not brown, 10 to
       15    minutes.  Cool.
  
  2.  Mix 3 cups of the flour and the salt in large bowl. Add 1 cup of
  the water, the onions and their liquid; stir to form a soft dough
  (use part or all of the remaining 1/4 cup water if needed). Knead
  dough on lightly floured surface to form smooth dough, using as much
  of the remaining flour as needed to prevent sticking.
  
  3.  Tear off small pieces of dough, slightly larger than an unshelled
  walnut.  Roll on floured surface into 4-inch rounds.
  
  4.  Heat large heavy skillet over medium-high heat; rub with bacon to
  coat lightly with fat.  Place as many rounds of bread in skillet as
  will fit in single layer; cook until lightly browned on bottom, 5 to
  8 minutes. (If breads begin to get too dark, reduce heat.) Turn
  rounds and brown the second side, about 8 minutes. Remove breads;
  keep warm wrapped in cloth. Repeat, rubbing skillet with bacon as
  needed and cooking remaining pieces of dough.  Serve flatbread warm.

  Heat a large cast-iron or heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat until
  hot. Lay the tomato slices in the pan in one layer and cook for 2 to
  3 minutes on each side to char. Lift the tomato slices from the pan
  and set aside on a plate.  Repeat the procedure until all the slices
  have been charred.
  
  Put the onion slices in the same pan and cook over high heat for 2 to
  3 minutes, stirring, until the onions begin to brown. Add the chopped
  basil and keep warm. Season the swordfish steaks with a little salt
  and pepper. Brush both sides of each with the remaining oil.
  
  Heat the same or another large cast-iron or heavy-bottomed skillet
  over high heat until hot. Alternately, prepare a charcoal, wood, or
  gas grill or preheat a broiler.  Cook the swordfish for 3 to 4
  minutes to a side for medium.  Do not overcook.  Put a swordfish
  steak in the center of each plate and spoon the warm tomato

 Categories: Bar-b-q, Sauces
      Yield: 32 Servings
 
      3 tb Bacon fat
      1    Onion,peeled/chopped
      1    Garlic clove,peeled/minced
    1/2 c  Green pepper,chopped
      1 cn Tomatoes,canned (16 oz)
      2 tb Tomato paste
      1 c  Water
      4 tb Brown sugar
      2 ts Mustard,dry
      1    Lemon,quarterd
    1/4 c  Vinegar
      1 ts Salt
      3 ds Red pepper sauce
 
  1. Heat bacon fat in a large heavy pot over low heat; saute onion,
  garlic, and green pepper until limp. Add remaining ingredients, blend
  well, bring to simmering, then lower heat and cook slowly until
  thick. Remove and discard lemon quarters. This sauce keeps well in
  the refrigerator, and Sybil often doubles the recipe to have on hand
  to use whenever a barbecue recipe is called for. Heat well before
  using. Baste over meat during last 15 minutes of cooking, and, if
  desired, spoon over cooked meat before serving.
  
  2. Excellent for chicken, spareribs, pork chops, hamburgers, hot dogs,
  steaks and kabobs - just about any barbecued meat.

      Title: SYD'S TURKEY GRAVY
 Categories: Poultry, Sauces
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
           Turkey giblets
           Water, cold
      1 ts Salt
      2 c  Turkey drippings
    1/2 c  Flour
 
  Assuming you are going to roast a turkey in the oven, it will be in a
  roasting pan of some kind.  I am also assuming this turkey had
  giblets (you know, liver, heart, gizzard and neck). While the turkey
  is roasting, put the giblets in a pretty large pot with lots of water
  and a little salt. Bring them to a boil and let 'em simmer. No length
  of time - just till they are done.
  
  After you remove the turkey from the roaster, there should be lots of
  juices in there that have accumulated during roasting.
   I pour them out into something and skim the fat off (or use one of
  those fat skimming cups or brushes). Then, put the de-fatted
  drippings back into the pan. Add some of the liquid from cooking the
  giblets if needed to make 2 c.  Whisk flour into it, and simmer while
  it thickens.
  
  Scrape up all of the "goodies" from the bottom of the pan to make the
  gravy extra-flavorful. If it gets too thick, you can add more liquid.
  If it isn't thick enough, add more flour and continue to whisk it, to
  keep out most of the lumps. You can chop up the giblets, finely and
  add them to the gravy as it is almost done - just to heat them
  through.
  
  If you have to add something because the color is not what you would
  like, a dash of Kitchen Bouquet will do it - not much.

MMMMM------------------COPYRIGHT 1995 S.STEIGER-----------------------

MMMMM--------------------VEGETABLES OF CHOICE-------------------------

MMMMM----------------------HERBS OF CHOICE---------------------------
      1    Turkey or chicken carcass
           Water
      1    Onions
      2    Carrots
      1 ts Celery seed; or stalks
      2    Bay leaves
      2 tb Parsley
      1 tb Sage leaves
      2 tb Oregano leaves
      1 tb Rosemary leaves
      2    Cloves, whole
           Water
 
  Cram as much of turkey carcass & leavings as will fit into crockpot.
  (I usually only manage to get about 1/2 of a carcass in.) Use all the
  leavings, including skin, even if you plan on defatting the stock. Add
  remaining ingredients and cover with water to within an inch or so of
  the top.  Cover crockpot and cook on low at least 2-3 DAYS (not a
  tyop!). Defat, strain out solids, package in pints or quarts, and
  freeze until needed.
  
  Sylvia's comments: This recipe, that I developed, is the easiest I've
  ever seen, and it produces the richest, most flavorful stock. If it's
  inconvenient to let it cool and package it after 3 days, let it cook
  another day or so until it is convenient.  You can't overcook it (at
  least I haven't managed to), the longer it cooks the richer it gets.
  I do check it every day or so to see if I need to add water, but I
  rarely have to. Don't flinch at the cloves, they don't add a clove-y
  flavor but they do add a nice hint of something. Since the stock is
  unsalted, it is great for anyone trying to restrict sodium intake.
  And it tastes so good that I try to snag turkey or chicken carcasses
  whenever I can. Let others take home the meat and stuffing, I want
  the carcass! <g> I also make stock from the bones of the whole KFC
  Rotisserie Gold chicken we buy occasionally.

  Melt bacon grease in skillet.  Cook onion until tender, then WITHOUT
  DRAINING melt butter (NOT margarine!) in onions and added to dry
  ingredients. Mix very well. Stir in crumbled cornbread and sunflower
  seeds, and stuff turkey. Bake breast side down until done.

  Open the bisquit package, and let them get to room temp. Coat a cookie
  sheet with oil, and press those biscuits into 6 inch pies, using more
  oil to lubricate them with your fingers. Fill the pies with the meat
  mixture, and turn over the ends slightly. Bake at 350 degrees for
  about 15 minutes, or until browned. These are great to make ahead of
  time...they freeze well, and can be nuked for a lunchtime snack.

      Roast nuts on shallow pan in preheated oven at 350 degrees F for
  10 minutes.
      Combine sugar, corn syrup, water, and cream of tartar in a deep
  sauce pot.  Stir gently over medium heat until sugar dissolves and
  bring to a boil.  After it comes to a boil, cover pot for 5 minutes,
  then wash down sides of pot with a clean brush to remove sugar
  crystals. Continue cooking on medium-high heat to 272 degrees F on a
  jelly thermometer. Remove from heat.
      In a separate pot heat honey to boil.
      Whip egg whites and salt until stiff and dry using a heavy
  electric mixer and large bowl.  Add a small amount of honey at first
  in a thin stream, very slowly. Beat in vanilla and continue adding
  remaining honey and then syrup.  Beat until batch thickens and the
  beater slows down. Add nuts and blend in.
      Oil a long shallow pan.  Sift a thick layer of cornstarch or
  sweet rice flour over it or lay rice wafers over bottom. Pour out the
  nougat. Dust top with more rice flour or thin rice wafers and let
  stand overnight to set. Cut into rectangular pieces about 3/4" by 1"
  and wrap individually in heavy waxed paper.

      Title: SYRUPS
 Categories: Canning
      Yield: 1 Text
 
 
  Adding syrup to canned fruit helps to retain its flavor, color, and
  shape. It does not prevent spoilage of these foods. The guidelines
  for preparing and using syrups (Table 1) offer a new "very light"
  syrup, which approximates the natural sugar content of many fruits.
  The sugar content in each of the five syrups is increased by about 10
  percent. Quantities of water and sugar to make enough syrup for a
  canner load of pints or quarts are provided for each syrup type.
  
  Procedure: Heat water and sugar together. Bring to a boil and pour
  over raw fruits in jars. For hot packs, bring water and sugar to
  boil, add fruit, reheat to boil, and fill into jars immediately.
  
  Other sweeteners: Light corn syrups or mild-flavored honey may be
  used to replace up to half the table sugar called for in syrups. For
  more information see Canned Foods for Special Diets.
  
  Table 1. Preparing and using syrups. (Measure of Water and Sugar)
  
  Syrup Type: Very Light.  Approx. % Sugar: 10. For 9-Pt Load: 6-1/2
  Cups Water, 3/4 Cups Sugar. For 7-Qt Load: 10-1/2 Cups Water, 1-1/4
  Cups Sugar. (Approximates natural sugar levels in most fruits and
  adds the fewest calories.)
  
  Syrup Type: Light.  Approx. % Sugar: 20. For 9-Pt Load: 5-3/4 Cups
  Water, 1-1/2 Cups Sugar. For 7-Qt Load: 9 Cups Water, 2-1/4 Cups
  Sugar. (Very sweet fruit.  Try a small amount the first time to see
  if your family likes it.)
  
  Syrup Type: Medium.  Approx. % Sugar: 30. For 9-Pt Load: 5-1/4 Cups
  Water, 2-1/4 Cups Sugar. For 7-Qt Load: 8-1/4 Cups Water, 3-3/4 Cups
  Sugar. (Sweet apples, sweet cherries, berries, grapes.)
  
  Syrup Type: Heavy.  Approx % Sugar: 40. For 9-Pt Load: 5 Cups Water,
  3-1/4 Cups Sugar. For 7-Qt Load: 7-3/4 Cups Water, 5-1/4 Cups Sugar.
  (Tart apples, apricots, sour cherries, gooseberries, nectarines,
  peaches, pears, plums.)
  
  Syrup Type: Very Heavy.  Approx % Sugar: 50. For 9-Pt Load: 4-1/4 Cups
  Water, 4-1/4 Cups Sugar For 7-Qt Load: 6-1/2 Cups Water, 6-3/4 Cups
  Sugar Very sour fruit. Try a small amount the first time to see if
  your family likes it.
  
  NOTES:
  
  9-Pt Load values are also adequate for a 4-quart load.
  
  Many fruits that are typically packed in heavy syrup are excellent and
  tasteful products when packed in lighter syrups. It is recommended
  that lighter syrups be tried, since they contain fewer calories from
  added sugar

      Title: SZECHUAN EGGPLANT
 Categories: Main dish, Low-fat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lg Eggplant
      1 bn Scallions, sliced
      2 tb Hot Szechuan sauce
      2 tb Reduced sodium teriyaki
           -sauce
    1/4 c  Cold water
 
  Peel eggplant.  Cut into 2 inch thick rounds, then slice the rounds
  into wedges (i.e., think of how pizza is cut). Saute in some water or
  broth in a non stick pan, turning to cook the wedges evenly. Cook for
  about 3-5 minutes per side, or until the slices are done to your
  liking. Add the scallions.  Mix the sauces and water and pour into
  the pan. Stir to coat. Serve over plain rice with lots of water (the
  sauce I used was HOT!). Notes: I used House of Tsang hot Szechuan
  sauce. It was not totally fatfree, but was all I had. The oils were
  very far down on the list of ingredients. The teriyaki was FF.  I am
  sure that you can find FF Szechuan sauce, however, so I posted this
  recipe anyway. Also, I recommend that you use just a touch of the hot
  sauce at first.

 Categories: Other sauce
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      5 oz Chunky peanut butter
      2 tb Low sodium soy sauce
  1 1/2 tb Water
      2 tb Sugar
      6    Garlic cloves -- minced
      1 tb Cilantro -- chopped
      4 ts Hot chili oil
 
  * Cilantro is usually sold in small bunches. You will need only about
  1/3 of an average bunch or 2-3 of the stems with leaves attached. It
  may also be sold as coriander or Chinese parsley.
  
  Place all ingredients in food processor EXCEPT cilantro. Process only
  long enough to thoroughly combine. Add finely chopped cilantro after
  processing is done. If added to the mixture first it will take on an
  unappealing color although it does not change the taste in any way.
  
  Yield: 1 cup or enough for 14-16 servings. Use about 1 tablespoon of
  sauce per serving of chicken or fish.

      Title: SZECHUAN STYLE CABBAGE RELISH
 Categories: Relishes, Vegetables, Appetizers, Vegetarian, Chinese
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 md Green cabbage

MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
      8 c  Water
      2 tb Szechuan peppercorns
      3 tb Salt
      2 tb -Strong spirits, or up to:
      3 tb Strong spirits
           -- (gin, tequilla, or
           -- kaoliang wine)
      1 c  Icicle radish, julienned
           -- (Optional)
    1/2 c  Carrot, julienned (optional)
      2 sl -Gingerroot, or up to:
      5 sl Gingerroot
      1 sm -Fresh Chile, or up to:
      3 sm Fresh Chiles (optional)
 
  This relish is certainly the most ubiquitous and popular in all China.
  There is even a special earthenware pickling jar for it. Encircling
  the mouth of the jar is a shallow, water-filled trough, into which
  the lid fits like an upturned bowl, affording an airtigh seal. Many a
  restaurant, no matter how small, keeps an ongoing batch in the works.
  It is especially favored as an appetizer or as an accompaniment to
  such specialties as boiled pot-stickers or noodles.
  
  Szechuan is a Western province of China where red pepper frequently
  enlivens the food.  The traditional hot, spicy flavor of this relish
  varies with individual taste; use as much or as little gingerroot
  and/or hot peppers as you like to do the job.  Chiles can be chopped
  for a really hot effect; or for mere warmth, leave them whole with a
  slit down one side. If you omit the chiles and gingerroot altogether,
  the resuld will be a pleasant pickle flavor with the natural
  sweetness of the crisp vegetables in the forefront.
  
  Green cabbage (not Chinese cabbage) is the principle ingredient, but
  other vegetables may be added for color (carrot) and variety (icicle
  radish). One batch requires several days' steeping. The brine should
  be reused, for each time the vegetables contribute their flavor, and
  it gets better and better.
  
  DIRECTIONS: =========== Discard limp outer leaves of cabbage. It is
  not necessary to separate leaves individually. Break the head into
  fairly large yet bite-sized pieces. Pat dry and let excess moisture
  evaporate.
  
  To make marinade: Brin to a boil the water, peppercorns, and salt.
  Strain out the peppercorns as you pour the liquid into a plastic
  container (with air-tight lid), ceramic bowl, or crock.  Let cool to
  room temperature.
  
  When the brine has cooled, add the alcohol, then cabbage and
  additional vegetables.  Weigh these down with a clean, heavy ceramic
  object (I simply use a plate) or stone so that they remain submerged
  in the brine. Cover tightly with plastic wrap or air-tight lid. Store
  in the refrigerator for at least three days before uncovering. The
  first one or two batches may seem a bit salty and raw-tasting; after
  that a mellow, richly mature character develops.  It can store
  indefinitely if kept cold, airtight, and clean. Always use clean, dry
  utensils when removing the vegetables. You can remove as much as you
  want at a time and add new vegetables before the previous batch is
  used up.
  
  To replenish the brine after several batches, add a little alcohol
  and a salt solution (1/2 teaspoon salt boiled with 1/2 cup water).
  The original marinade can be reboiled with additional water and salt,
  but this results in some flavor loss.
  
  Variation: Shred the marinated cabbage or chop it coarsely, to yield
  about 5 cups, loosely packed.  Toss with 1 tablespoon soy sauce,
  2-1/2 teaspoons sugar, 1 tablespoon vinegar (cider or Chinese dark),
  and 1-1/2 teaspoons sesame oil.  Serve at room temperature or chilled.

      Title: SZECHUAN-STYLE SLICED FISH
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb FRESH RED SNAPPER OR
           -GROUPER
      1 ts CORNSTARCH
      1    EGG WHITE
      1 ts PEANUT OIL
      1 oz TREE EARS
      1 lg RED BELL PEPPER
      2 oz SNOW PEAS
      2 oz WATER CHESTNUTS
      1    IN. PEELED GINGER ROOT
      1    SCALLION
      1 ts MINCED GARLIC
      2 tb SOY SAUCE
    1/2 c  CHICKEN BROTH
    1/2 tb SUGAR
    1/2 tb VINEGAR
      1 tb CORNSTARCH
      1 tb SHERRY
      2 c  PEANUT OIL, FOR FRYING
 
  Slice the fish into pieces 1/3 in. thick and 2 in. square. Combine
  the fish with the corn- starch, egg white, and 1 tsp. peanut oil, and
  let stand for 20 minutes. Cover the tree ears with warm water and let
  stand for 20 minutes. Core and seed the red pepper and cut it into 1
  in. squares. Snap the snow peas. Rinse the water chestnuts. Cut the
  ginger into thin sli- vers, the scallion, into thin slices, and fine-
  ly chop the garlic. Combine the ingredients for the sauce. Heat the
  oil in a wok or frying pan- it should be very hot before adding the
  fish. Add the fish, piece by piece, and cook for 1 minute. Transfer
  the fish with a slotted spoon to a strainer over a bowl to catch the
  oil. Discard all but 1/4 cup oil from wok and heat it again. Add the
  ginger, scallion, and garlic, and stir-fry over high heat for 10
  seconds. Add the pepper, water chestnuts, and pea pods, and stir-fry
  for 1 minute. Add the tree ear and fish. Thoroughly mix the sauce and
  add it to the wok. Cook the fish, stirring gently, for 1 minute, or
  until the sauce thickens. This recipe calls for a slippery black
  fungus called tree ears in North America, cloud ears in China, and
  jelly mushrooms in Thailand. Tree ears have very little flavor and
  are chiefly prized for their slippery, crisp consistency. Available
  dried at Oriental markets, tree ears will keep indefinately. They
  need only be soak- ed in warm water for 20 minutes before using.

      Title: SZECHWAN CRISPY SKIN DUCK
 Categories: Chinese, Poultry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Fresh Duck, 4 1/2 pounds
      3    Or 4 Star Anise
      2 ts Sichuan peppercorns
      1    Two-inch cinnamon stick
  1 1/2 tb Coarse salt
      1    One-inch cube ginger,
           -smashed
      1    Scallion
           Dark soy sauce
      1 tb Dry sherry or Shaoxing wine
      1 tb Cornstarch
    1/2 ts Sugar
      1    Egg white, beaten until
           -foamy
           Oil for frying
 
  INSTRUCTIONS; Rinse the duck and dry thoroughly. Combine the star
  anise, Sichuan peppercorns, cinnamon and salt in a skillet; heat,
  shaking the skillet, until the spices begin to smoke and the salt
  starts to turn a light golden color. Cool.
  
  Sprinkle some of this mixture into the cavity of the duck including
  all the star anise and the cinnamon stick. Add the ginger and
  scallion to the cavity and skewer closed. Rub the outside of the duck
  with the rest of the seasoned salt mixture and hang the duck by a
  string (around the neck if the duck has a head or under the wings if
  not) overnight in a cool, airy place.
  
  The next day, steam the duck on a plate in a large steamer or covered
  wok for an hour to an hour and 15 minutes. Cool and rub all over with
  a small amount of dark soy sauce. Wrap in foil and refrigerate until
  ready to cook. (It's fine this way for a day or two.)
  
  Several hours before cooking, take the duck out of the refrigerator
  and make a light batter: Mix the sherry with the cornstarch and sugar
  until well blended then stir in the egg white. Rub thoroughly over
  the duck and allow to sit.
  
  Heat a large quantity of oil until nearly smoking in a 16-inch or
  larger wok or in a large deep fryer. Immerse the duck in the oil and
  fry until golden, about 15 minutes, spooning the oil continuously
  over the exposed part of the duck. You might want to turn the duck
  during this time. If so, carefully remove it with a large slotted
  spatula or skimmer and drain the cavity into a bowl before adding it
  again to the hot oil. When the duck is done, drain it on paper towels.
  
  Let the duck rest for 5 to 10 minutes, then carve it Western- style
  or cut into pieces, Chinese-style. A suggestion is to serve it on a
  bed of watercress that has been sprinkled very lightly with sesame
  oil. The juices from the duck will blend with the sesame oil to make
  a sauce.
  
  TEA-SMOKED DUCK; Follow the steps above and steam the duck only 1
  hour. Before refrigerating, line a large wok with aluminum foil and
  spread 1 cup of uncooked rice, 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of Chinese
  black tea over the bottom. Put the duck on a metal rack suspended
  over the tea mixture; cover with the wok lid. Moisten paper towels
  and press them around the edge of the wok lid forming a seal. Turn
  the heat to medium high and allow the duck to smoke for 15 to 20
  minutes. Turn off the heat and let the duck sit for another 45
  minutes. Uncover, wrap the duck and refrigerate. Then proceed as in
  the master recipe.

      Title: SZECHWAN CUCUMBER SALAD
 Categories: Chinese, Salads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Salad
 
      2 tb Small dried wood ear
           -mushrooms
      2    Cucumbers
      4    Red hot peppers cut in thin
           -rounds
      2 ts Light soy sauce
      2 tb Chinese white vinegar
      2 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Sesame oil
 
  Pour boiling water over tree ears; let stand for 15 minutes. Peel
  cucumbers, cut in half lengthwise, scrape out seeds. Slice into thin
  half-moons.  When mushrooms are soft, drain, rinse and dry. (Slice
  'em if they're too big.  Wood ears will quadruple in size when
  soaked++SC.) Combine with remaining ingredients. Let stand for 15
  minutes then toss again before serving.
  
  NOTE:  (Wood ears can be found in Chinese markets. After soaking they
  have little taste but lots of crunch. They're there for the texture.
  I can't think of anything to substitute (maybe raw carrots or water
  chestnuts) except for dried duck web or jellyfish and you're much
  more likely to find wood ears than those items. Be sure to use the
  dark, cooked, Asian sesame oil rather than the light stuff in health
  food stores. I'd make this before the ribs and chill it well while
  doing the rest.)

      Title: SZECHWAN PEPPERCORN OIL "CHINA MOON"
 Categories: Condiments, China
      Yield: 2 Cups
 
      6 tb Peppercorns, Szechwan
      2 c  Oil, Corn or Peanut
      2 tb Chile Flakes, dried red
           -shockingly pungent
  2 1/2 tb Ginger, fresh
           - finely minced
      2 tb Scallions, green & white
           - cut in rings
 
  Heat a large skillet over moderate heat until hot enough to evaporate
  a bead of water on contact. Add the Szechwan peppercorns and stir
  until toasted and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Adjust the heat so the
  peppercorns brown without scorching.
  
  Combine the peppercorns and all of the remaining ingredients in a
  heavy, non aluminum 1 to 1 1/2 quart saucepan. Rest a deep-fry
  thermometer on the rim of the pot. Over moderately low heat, bring
  the mixture to a bubbly 225 degrees, stirring occasionally. Let
  simmer for 15 minutes, checking to ensure the temperature does not
  rise. Remove from the heat and let stand until cool or overnight.
  
  Strain the oil through a fine-mesh sieve and discard the solids.
  Store the oil in an impeccably clean glass jar at cool room
  temperature.
  
  This oil is particularly good for salads. Its herbal quality also
  makes it a nice partner to poultry or beef dishes.

      Title: SZEKELY GOULASH
 Categories: Entrees, Hungarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Sauerkraut, rinsed
           -and drained
           -(use a colander)
      1 tb Caraway seeds
      2 tb Butter (or oil
           -or bacon drippings)
      1 lb Pork shoulder, cut into
           -large, bite-sized pieces
      2    Garlic cloves,
           -finely chopped
      1 lb Hungarian sausage
           -(or Polish sausage),
           -sliced into large,
           -bite-size rounds
      1 lg Onion, chopped
      1    Green pepper, chopped
      1 tb Hungarian sweet paprika
           -(or use fresh paprika
           -from the supermarket)
      2 c  Sour cream
 
  Use a covered pot large enough to hold all the ingredients. Put the
  sauerkraut in just enough water to cover it, add caraway seeds, and
  simmer with the cover on for two hours (or longer, if you want).
  
  In a large, heavy skillet melt the butter and brown the pork. Put the
  pork and the sausage into the pot with the sauerkraut.
  
  Saute the onion in the skillet until transparent; add the garlic and
  saute for a few more minutes. Add this to the pot, along with the
  green pepper and paprika. (I've had good luck adding some cayenne at
  this point.) Simmer (with the cover on loosely) for a couple of
  hours, mixing it up occasionally. Remove from heat and let cool for
  30 minutes; then stir in the sour cream and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Southern Hungarian Goulash -- This goulash is a specialty of
  Szekely, the southern part of Hungary. My grandmother cooked it
  without a recipe; this recipe is from my mother, with my
  modifications. (Szekely is not pronounced the way it's spelled;
  say-ki-ee is a little closer, but still wrong.)
  
  *  This goes well with noodles, dumplings, potatoes, or spaetzle
  (called nokedli in Hungarian).  The longer it cooks, the better it
  tastes; it's even better reheated. Cook it the day before but don't
  add the sour cream until you've reheated it.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes chopping, many hours cooking.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      1 c  Yogurt, plain
      1 ts Vinegar, white
 
    Soak beans in 1 quart cold water the night before you plan to make
  soup. Next day, drain beans and put aside.
    Put 2 quarts water in a large soup pot and in it cook bones and
  vegetables with salt over low heat for 2 hours. Strain and save
  liquid.
    Put drained beans into the reserved liquid; add enough water to
  bring the amount back to 2 quarts. Cook covered over low heat till
  beans are done.
    Make little dumplings and put aside.
    Melt the lard in a frying pan. Wilt onion in it, then mix in the
  flour and cook over very low heat till the mixture is light brown.
    Remove from heat and mix in mashed garlic and paprika. Whip in 1/2
  cup cold water. Add to the almost ready bean soup and cook the soup
  over very low heat for at least 10 minutes longer.
    Note: this southern Hungarian dish probably appears in Serbian
  cookbooks as a Serbian dish, where it is hopefully titled "Hungarian
  Bean Soup".

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  The Parsis, a tiny ethnic group displaced in ancient times from
  Persia to India, have a distinctive cuisine. Some years ago, Perviz
  Parakh, a member of the Parsi community in Melboume, published a
  booklet con- taining this recipe.
  
  Finely chop 2 large onions and fry in 3 tablespoons of oil until
  golden brown.  Add to the onions 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, 1
  teaspoon chilli powder, 1/2 teaspoon of ground turmeric and salt to
  taste. Stir to mix and continue to cook for a few minutes.  Chop 1/2
  kg of ripe tomatoes and 1 green chilli and finely chop a bunch of
  fresh coriander. Add them to the onion mixture and cook until the
  tomatoes are done and there is not too much juice left in the pan.
  Add 2 tablespoons brown vinegar and 6 teaspoons brown sugar and cook
  5 minutes longer.
  
  Transfer the tomato mixture to a lightly greased gratin dish (or 6
  individual gratin dishes).  Smooth the surface and make 12 hollows
  with the back of a spoon. Slide an egg into each hollow. Bake the
  dish in a preheated 180C oven for about 25 minutes or until the egg
  whites are set.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

  This cinnamon-orange marinade, characteristic of Balkan cooking, is a
  specialty of Georgia in south-central Russia. The tabaka marinade is
  usually used with chicken and game hen, but it also goes nicely with
  swordfish.
  
  Remove zest of 1 orange and the lemon.  (This is best done using a
  vegetable peeler.  Be sure to take only the zest, not bitter white
  pith beneath it.)  Juice oranges, lemon and limes. Combine juice and
  zest in bowl. Peel and mince garlic and ginger root. Finely chop
  onion. Add garlic, ginger and onion to citrus juices along with
  cinnamon, paprika, sugar, salt, black pepper, nutmeg, wine and oil.
  Whisk to mix. Makes enough marinade for 1 1/2 pounds chicken, game
  hens and swordfish.

  and salads to the workers who dropped in for lunch.
  
  Heat 1/2 cup of the oil in a large skillet (not cast iron) over
  medium heat and add the okra.  Cook, stirring frequently, until it is
  no longer ropy, about 30 minutes. Add the vinegar and cook, stirring,
  for another 10 minutes, until the okra takes on a brownish color and
  is reduced to about a quarter of its original volume. Put the okra in
  a medium bowl and set aside.
  
  In a large stockpot over high heat, bring the water to a boil.
  Meanwhile, add the remaining 1/4 cup oil and the ham to the skillet.
  Saute the ham over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes, or until it
  is lightly browned.
  
  With a slotted spoon, remove the ham to the stockpot. In the same
  skillet, combine the onions, celery, garlic and pepper; cook,
  stirring constantly, for 10 minutes, until the vegetables are tender.
  Add the vegetables, okra and tomatoes to the stockpot; cover and
  simmer over medium heat for 1 hour.
  
  Reduce the heat to very low, add the shrimp and simmer very slowly
  for 10 minutes.  Add the crabmeat and Tabasco sauce; simmer for an
  additional 5 to 10 minutes. Serve the gumbo in soup bowls with scoops

 Categories: Preserves
      Yield: 6 Jars- 8 oz
 
      4 lg Red Or Green Peppers, Cored
           - And Seeded
  1 1/2 ts Tabasco Pepper Sauce
    3/4 c  Cider Vinegar
  3 1/2 c  Sugar
      3 oz Pouch Of Fruit Pectin
 
  We generally make our pepper jelly with aged Tabasco pepper mash from
  the factory to give it color and flavor. Although perhaps not quite
  as fiery, this simple recipe using the pepper sauce makes a mellow,
  spicy jelly. Spread cream cheese on crackers, then top with a dollop
  of the jelly for a tempting morsel to serve with cocktails. Pectin is
  available in well-stocked supermarkets. Cut the peppers into large
  pieces, then coarsely chop in a food processor or blender. In a large
  non aluminum saucepan over high heat, combine the peppers, Tabasco
  sauce, vinegar, and sugar. Bring to a boil and boil rapidly for 10
  minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and stir in the
  pectin. Return the pan to the heat and return to a boil. Boil the
  jelly for exactly 1 minute, then remove from the heat. Stirring
  frequently to prevent bits of pepper from rising to the surface, skim
  the foam off the top.  Ladle the jelly into hot sterilized jars,
  seal, and place on a rack in a deep kettle. Pour boiling water over
  the jars to cover by 2 inches and bring to a boil over high heat.
  Continue to boil for 10 minutes, then remove to a rack to cool. Makes
  six 8-ounce jars.

      Title: TABOULI
 Categories: Appetizers, Rice, Mcdougall
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Bulgur; dry
      1 c  Water; boiling
      1    Tomato; chopped
    1/2 c  Fresh parsley; chopped
      2 tb Lemon juice
    1/8 ts Garlic powder
    1/4 c  Green onions; chopped
           (about 3 green onions)
    1/4 c  Fresh mint leaves
    1/2 c  Garbanzo beans, cooked
 
  Recipe by: McDougall Put the bulgur in a small mixing bowl. Pour the
  boiling water over the bulgur. Mix. Cover with a towel and let stand
  for 1 hour. After 1 hour the excess water should be removed. The
  easiest way to do this is to pour the bulgur and water into a fine
  mesh strainer. Let the water drain off, pressing the bulgur with your
  hands to remove as much of the excess water as possible. Place the
  drained bulgur in a bowl. Add the remaining ingredients. Toss well to
  mix. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours to blend flavors.
  
  HELPFUL HINTS: This is a great make-ahead dish, easy to take to a
  pot-luck dinner or picnic. Try it stuffed in pita bread for a
  different sandwich idea. This recipe can be doubled or quadrupled
  easily for larger amounts. Keeps well in regrigerator. From the

      Title: TABOULI (BULGUR WHEAT SALAD)
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Whole wheat bulgur
      1 lg Onion chopped
        x  Boiling water
      1 lb Tomatoes, chopped or 1*16*oz
        cn Diced tomatoes
    1/2 c  Lemon juice
    1/4 ts Black epper
        x  Salt
 
  Put 1 cup of whole wheat bulgur and 1 large chopped onion in a medium
  Pyrex bowl and cover with boiling water...let these soak 2 hours (if
  you like the bite of raw onion, you can add the onion later...I like
  it better slightly cooked by the water).  Drain well and add 1 lb of
  fresh chopped tomatoes or one 16 oz can of diced tomatoes, 1/3 cup
  lemon juice (freshly squeezed tastes much better than from
  concentrate), 1/4 tsp or more freshly ground black pepper, and salt
  to taste. Let it stand for several hours or overnight in the
  refrigerator to mix the flavors. Pritikin also suggested adding fresh
  mint leaves, chopped, but I've never had any to try! This is great in
  ww pita pockets!
  
  Enjoy...and let me know if you make any yummy variations!

      5    Eggs yolks -- well beaten
      5 tb Sour cream
      5 tb Sugar
      1 tb Almond extract
    1/4 ts Salt
  2 1/2 c  Flour
 
  Combine all, adding each item as listed, and enough more flour so that
  dough is no longer sticky, but still very soft. Roll small portions of
  dough at a time to paper-thin. Use lightly floured working surface.
  Cut into strips 2"x5" and arrange in single layer on oiled cookie
  sheets. Bring enough oil to 400~ in deep heavy saucpan, at least 3"
  deep. As you drop the dough into oil, make a 1" slit down center of
  each and draw the opposite ends of the strip through the slit.
  They'll fall to the bottom but will surface in a few seconds as they
  brown, about 2 minutes. Lift out with tongs and drop into large

 Categories: Meats, Beef, Ethnic
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Ground chuck
      1 c  Onion -- chop
      1    Green pepper -- chop
      1 ts Mustard seeds
      3 tb Beef bouillon powder -- or
      1 ts Chili powder
    1/8 ts Tabasco
      1 ts Cumin powder
  1 1/2 c  Bottled chili sauce
    1/3 c  Sweetpickle relish
      1 sm Can tomato paste
      6 oz Water tomato Paste can
      3 tb Dark molasses
 10 1/2 oz Beef broth
           Hot fried taco shells
           Lettuce -- shred
           Monterey Jack Cheese-grate
 
  Pack beef into ungreased 10" skillet on medium heat. Cover and let
  simmer, reducing to low heat after 5 minutes. You don't really want
  to overbrown the beef, but to allow some moisture to combine with the
  natural fat in the chuck to create a broth while it simmer. Depending
  on the percentage of fat content in the beef, I'd let it steam like
  this for about 12-15 minutes. Turn off heat. Drain liquid from beef
  into blender with HALF of the beef. With on/off speed blend this
  mixture until it resembles a brick-layer's mortar. To the mixture of
  pulvarized beef and the remaining half which you did not put into the
  blender, add onion, green pepper, mustard seed, bouillon powder and
  chili powder. Stir in hotpepper sauce, cumin powder, chili sauce,
  sweet pickle relish, tomato paste, water, molasses and beef broth.
  (If you like a thinner sauce, add more beef broth). Simmer this
  uncovered, stirring frequently to prevent scorching or use your slow
  cooker on "high" for about 2 hours. On top of the range, simmer 1
  hour, adding additional liquid as necessary tokeep sauce consistency.
  Spoon it into the fried taco shells. Top it off  with lettuce, grated
  cheese and Taco 5 Alarm Sauce. Source: Gloria Pitzer Presents The

 Categories: Chicken, Jewish, Passover, Moroccan
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           -JUDI M. PHELPS
      2 tb Pareve margarine or
           Vegetable oil
      1 md Onion; finely chopped
  3 1/2 lb Meaty chicken pieces; remove
           -skin if desired
      1 c  ;water
      1    To 3 tsp. ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts Ground ginger
    1/4    To 1/2 tsp black pepper;
           -preferably freshly ground
        pn ;salt
     10    To 12 oz pitted prunes;
           -about 2 cups
      1 tb Honey or sugar (optional)
      1 c  Whole blanches almonds;
           -lightly toasted
 
  In a very large deep skillet or a Dutch oven, over medium-high heat,
  heat the margarine or oil (or use a mixture); then saute the onion
  until it is tender but not browned. Add the chicken to the skillet
  and lightly brown it on all sides.
  
  Mix the water with the cinnamon, ginger, pepper, and salt and pour it
  over the browned chicken.  Bring the liquid to a boil. Cover the
  skillet tightly, lower the heat, and simmer the chicken for 30
  minutes, turning the pieces occasionally.  Add the prunes and honey
  (if used) to the skillet, evenly distributing the prunes around the
  chicken, and making sure they are covered with liquid.  Cover the
  skillet again, and simmer the chicken and prunes together for about
  20 minutes, or until both are very tender. If the sauce becomes too
  dry and begins to stick to the bottom of the skillet, stir in
  additional water as needed.
  
  Use tongs or a slotted spoon to transfer the chicken to a large
  serving platter.  Stir about half the almonds into the prune sauce
  remaining in the pot; then spoon the sauce mixture over the chicken.
  Garnish the top with the remaining almonds.
  
  Note:  To toast the almonds, spread them in a jelly roll or similar
  pan and heat then in a 350-degree oven, stirring them occasionally,
  for about 10 minutes, or until they are lightly browned.  Or, to
  toast them in the Moroccan manner, heat some vegetable oil in a
  skillet and saute the almonds in the oil until they are lightly
  browned; then remove them with a slotted spoon and drain them on
  paper towels.

      Title: TAGLIATELLE
 Categories: Pasta
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
     15 oz Tagliatelle
      3 oz Butter
      2    Egg yolks
      2 tb Parmesan, grated
      6 tb Double cream
      4 oz Bacon (chopped)
           Salt
           Pepper, freshly-milled
 
  Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil, add some salt and a few
  drops of oil and cook the tagliatelle for 8 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, melt about 1 oz of butter in a small pan and cook the
  chopped bacon for 3-4 minutes.
  
  Beat the egg yolks together with the remainder of the butter, the
  Parmesan cheese, the cream and some freshly-milled black pepper.
  Drain the tagliatelle and put it back in the pan quickly so as not to
  lose heat.
  
  Add the bacon and its juices to the pasta, pour in the egg and cream
  mixture and toss well. (If you've done this quickly enough, the heat
  from the pasta will cook the egg yolks to a creamy sauce). Season
  with salt and pepper if desired, then serve with more Parmesan.
  
  Serve accompanied with green vegetables such as courgettes (zucchini)
  or leeks, or with a green salad.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Tagliatelle with bacon and cream -- A quick yet rich recipe,
  originally published in the recipe column in _BBC Radio Times_
  magazine.
  
  *  For aesthetic reasons, green tagliatelle looks best when served.
  
  *  "Double cream" is a product not normally available in North
  America. It has 40 percent butterfat; "whipping cream" has 30 percent
  butterfat. If you make this recipe with whipping cream instead of
  double cream, then use about 1 T more butter.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (timing is critical).
  : Time:  15 minutes.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

      2 tb Soy sauce
    175 g  Tagliatelle
           -- cooked 'al dente'
 
  This is a kind of western chow mein, quickly and easily prepared. A
  delicious way to eat tagliatelle, the soft pasta contrasting with the
  crunchiness of the Chinese vegetables.
  
  Stir-fry the spring onions and ginger gently in the oil for a couple
  of minutes so that they soften, then toss in the prepared vegetables
  and stir until they heat through and begin to soften - about 4-5
  minutes. Then stir in the soy sauce and heat through again, stirring
  all the time. Pour this mixture over the hot, drained tagliatelle in
  a warm serving-dish, toss thoroughly and serve immediately.

  4 1/2 c  Flour
      1 lb Honey
      8    Eggs
      1 c  Sugar
      1 ts Ginger
 
  Mix eggs, flour and baking powder and knead well. Dough should be
  soft but stiff enough to roll.  Roll with hands by bits into long
  ropes 1/2" in diameter. Use very little flour in rolling to avoid
  toughness. Slice in 1/2" lengths.  Heat oven to 350 F.  While oven is
  heating, bring to boil the honey, ginger and sugar in a shallow broad
  bottmed pan. Put into this the pieces of dough.  Then place pan into
  oven.  Do not open oven for first 15 or 20 min.  By this time the
  honey will have coated each piece of dough. Now, stir every 10 min.
  to prevent the pieces from sticking to each other. Takes abt. an hour
  for baking.  Pieces should be brown and when tested in cold water
  should remain firm and crisp. Pour onto moistened board, flatten,
  sprinkle nuts on top and cut into squares. Makes 40 pcs. and will

  TAILLAULE FROM NEUCHATEL: the story
  
  "Taillaule", a sort of sweetened bread, was made differently in the
  past. It was a flattened ball of dough baked directly on the floor of
  the oven. The surface was cut sharply with a pointed knife or snipped
  with scissors to form deep parallel cuts. This gave rise to its name
  "taillaule" meaning cut. These early "taillaules" had a somewhat
  different flavour from the present day moulded loaves.
  
  The recipe:
  
  Add the yeast, eggs (1), sugar, malt, salt, lemon zest and flour to
  the milk. Knead well to obtain a smooth dough. Add the softened
  butter and knead again. Finally add the dried fruit.
  
  Cover the dough and leave to rise in a warm place for about 1 hour.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal parts as if making two French sticks and
  place in 2 fruit cake tins.
  
  Leave again in a warm place to rise to 3/4 height of tin.
  
  Brush with beaten egg (2) and make zig zag cuts with the scissors in
  the surface.
  
  Bake in the tins at 200 oC for 25 minutes .
  
  Remove from oven, brush with an apricot glaze and then coat with a
  water icing.
  
  Toasted flaked almonds can be sprinkled on top.
  
  Recommended drink: tea or coffee.

      Title: TAMALE INSTRUCTIONS
 Categories: Mexican
      Yield: 50 Servings
 
      2 pk Dried cornhusks
           Warm water
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Leti Labell Prepare the corn husks: First
  go through the corn husks, separating them, and removing pieces of
  cornsilk (and also dirt, etc.) that you find. Then place them in a
  large bowl and cover with tap water. (I put several plates on top of
  the corn husks to hold them down, because they have a tendency to
  float.) Let them soak for at least half an hour. Rinse the corn husks
  several times, to clean them. Then drain them well. Next, dry off the
  corn husks. While you do this, you can separate them into piles: big
  husks, medium, and too little to be worth using. At this time, you
  can also prepare some thin strips of corn husk, that you will use to
  tie the tamales together. (This is where you you the little pieces
  too small to make a tamale.) (I found that the pieces weren't long
  enogh to tie around the tamales, so I tied two shorter pieces of thin
  husk together. More on this later.) Make the tamales: Hold a large
  corn husk in your hand, with the narrow end pointing to the right.
  Take a spoonful of dough (I used a serving spoon, about 2 Tbs or so)
  and spread it on the corn husk, about 1-1/2 inches from the wide end,
  and about 4 inches from the narrow end. Spread the dough right up to
  the edge of the corn husk on one side, leaving enough of a flap to
  wrap around the tamale. (If the husk isn't wide enough for you to be
  able to wrap it around, you'll use another husk - more on this
  later.) Next, spread a spoonful (again, about 2 Tbs) of filling down
  the middle of the dough. Roll the sides of the corn husk in toward
  the center, bringing the edges of the dough together, enclosing the
  filling. Wrap the rest of the corn husk around to the back. If there
  is not enough husk to wrap around to the back, place another corn
  husk around the tamale, to hold the edge closed. Now, wrap the top
  (broad end) edge down, and flip the bottom part (the narrow end) up,
  so that it covers the edge of the broad end. Then, using the thin
  strips of corn husk, tie across the middle to hold the top and bottom
  flaps in place. Steaming the tamales: Stand the tamales on end in a
  steamer. If you don't have a steamer, you could put the tamales in a
  metal collander, and place the collander in a large pot. Just be sure
  that the tamales do not touch the water below. Bring the water to a
  brisk boil, and steam the tamales for at least an hour. I did it for
  an hour and 15 minutes. You can test one to see if they are done: the
  dough will easily separate from the husk. Just be careful - don't
  burn yourself on the steam! You can reheat tamales in the oven at 350
  degrees for about 15 minutes. (Don't try to re-steam them.) If you
  freeze them, you can reheat them by putting the frozen tamales in a
  casserole dish, covering with foil, and heating in a 350 oven for

  prepare spices and then sautee carrots in vinegar or whatever you

  stirring and cooking about 3 min, then add salsa and reduce heat to a
  simmer. while the bean mixture is simmering, bring 2c water to boil
  with dash of salt. a little at a time, sprinkle the corn meal into
  the boiling water, stirring constantly to avoid lumps.  continue
  sprinkling and stirring until you have a thick porridge resembling
  grits or cream of wheat (ymmv with the amount of corn meal this takes
  ~- don't force all the corn meal into the batter if it looks done
  with less). remove batter from heat and stir in chili powder. the
  bean mixture should be just about cooked now -- if carrots are
  tender, remove bean mixture from heat.
  
  spread 1/2 the corn meal mixture into the bottom of a large loaf pan
  or small baking dish. spread all of the bean mixture (or as much as
  reaonably fits in your pan) onto the corn batter. top with remaining
  half of the batter, kind of like a top and bottom crust. bake at 400
  f for 30 min or until the top corn meal batter is pretty firmly set.
  
  garnish, if desired, with fresh tomatoes, cilantro, scallions, hot
  sauce, etc.

           -seeded & skinned (to taste)
      2 tb Lard
      1 lg Bay leaf

MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
    2/3 c  Lard; room temp
      4 c  Masa harina
      1 tb Salt
      1 tb Baking powder
      3 c  Warm pork stock (reserved
           -from pork filling recipe)
 
  Filling:  Place pork in a large, heavy saucepan or Dutch oven and add
  water just to the top of the meat. Add two teaspoons salt and 1/2
  teaspoon pepper and raisins. Cover and bring to a boil over high
  heat. Reduce heat to moderately low and simmer about two hours, or
  until meat is very tender.
  
  Strain stock into a container for use in the dough. When meat is cool
  enough to handle, shred with a fork or fingers. Puree onion, garlic,
  tomatoes, tomato sauce, oregano, shiles and jalapeno in a blender or
  processor.
  
  Heat lard in a skillet over moderate heat.  Add puree, 1/2 tablespoon
  salt, bay leaf, and sugar and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring
  constantly. Mix puree with the shredded meat and raisins. Taste and
  add additional salt, pepper, or jalapenos if desired. Makes about
  five cups.
  
  Dough:  In a small, straight-sided mixing bowl beat the lard with an
  electric mixer, processor, or fork until it is light and fluffy. On a
  piece of wax paper mix masa with salt and baking powder and beat into
  lard, adding about 1/4 of the mixture at a time.  When well mixed,
  beat in stock 1/4 cup at a time to make a slightly mushy, but not
  watery, dough.
  
  Construction:  Put shucks in a large bowl, cover with very hot water,
  and let soak for at least 1-1/2 to two hours, until soft and pliable.
  If using packaged shucks, separate them after a few minutes of
  soaking to make sure each one is in contact with the water. Before
  using, shake excess water from the softened shucks. Wet your hands.
  For each tamale spread about two tablespoons of the dough into a
  rectangle on the inside of a shuck; spread to within 3/4 inch of the
  edges and leave about three inches at the pointed end and 1-1/2
  inches at the wide end of the shuck. Spread 1-1/2 to two tablespoons
  filling lengthwise down the center of the dough. Fold over ends of
  shucks so that dough completely covers filling. Arrange tamales
  upright in steamer with folded wide ends down.
  
  To cook tamales, fill the bottom of a steamer with water to a depth of
  about one inch.  If desired, line steamer basket with additional corn
  shucks.  Pack wrapped tamales upright in basket with the broad ends
  of the shucks down.  When steamer is full, cover tamales with
  additional shucks or a clean dish towel to prevent condensation from
  soaking them. Cover pot tightly and bring to a boil over high heat.
  Reduce heat to moderately low and steam one to 1-1/2 hours. Add water
  as necessary. Unwrap a tamale, and if dough comes away from the shuck
  easily, tamales are cooked. Tightly covered, tamales may be kept
  several days in the refrigerator, or they may be frozen for several
  weeks. Reheat, covered, in a 300 F. oven.

 Categories: Mexican, Tamales, Posted
      Yield: 1 Dozen
 
      2 c  Masa harina
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Cinnamon
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 c  Margarine
    1/4 c  Lard
  1 1/2 c  Chicken stock
      1 c  Almonds; sliced or slivered
      1 c  Raisins OR blackberries,
           -fresh or frozen; sweetened
           -with sugar
      1 pk Dried corn husks; soaked in
           -hot water to soften
 
  Stir together dry ingredients (masa harina, sugar, salt, cinnamon and
  baking powder).
  
  Cream margarine and lard until fluffy. Gradually beat masa harina
  mixture and broth into the lard. Beat well for about 5 minutes. (A
  small test ball of the dough should rise in cold water.) Stir almonds
  into dough. If using raisins, mix into the dough. If using
  blackberries, reserve and use as a center filling.
  
  Place 6 to 8 cups of water and a coin into the bottom of the steamer.
  Shake excess water from the softened corn husks. Line steamer with
  corn husks. Spread dough (approximately 2 tablespoons) evenly on the
  center of the remaining husks. If using blackberries, place a
  spoonful of berries in center of dough. Roll and turn up. If
  necessary, roll in an additional husk, or tie with a piece of string
  to secure. Pack tamales into steamer as they are made. Surround with
  corn husks.
  
  Top with terry toweling and secure lid. Bring to a boil over high
  heat. Reduce to medium and steam for 1-1/2 to 2 hours. Remember to
  listen for the coin; it will let you "hear" the water level. When the
  coin becomes silent, the water level is too low and you must add more.
  
  To reheat, place in greased frying pan over medium-low and heat
  through, turning occasionally. If preferred, the tamales may be
  wrapped in foil and reheated in a 350 degree oven 20 to 30 minutes.
  Use foil method and add an additional 15 minutes to reheat. Tamales
  freeze well.
  
  This makes about a dozen small tamales.
  
  NOTE: These are the sweet tamales that I have personally had while on
  trips into Mexico, and they are soo-o-oh good, but there are other
  recipes containing fruits, i.e., pineapple - (in my experience, these
  are usually sickening sweet but that's my humble opinion).

      2 oz New Mexican red chile --
           Dried

  1 1/2 lb Pork shoulder or beef
           Shoulder roast
    1/2 lg Onion -- sliced
      5    Cloves garlic -- peeled &
           Smashed

      1 ts Cumin seeds
      4 tb Ground chile seasoning
      4 tb Lard or vegetable
           Shortening
 
  The Corn Husks
  
  The dried husks are brittle and must be soaked in water to soften them
  before they can be rolled into tamales. In the package, the husks for
  a whole ear of corn are usually pressed together. Separate the
  individual husks being careful not to break them, since they are
  fragile when dry.
  
  Place the separated husks in a large pot and cover with hot water.
  Leave them to soak for about one hour. You can put a plate with a
  heavy object on it on top of the tamales to keep them submerged. When
  soft, rinse the husks well and put back into a pot of clean water.
  
  The Filling
  
  While the husks are soaking, prepare the meat filling. The chile used
  to season tamales is the ancho. The ancho is the ripened, dried form
  of the poblano. It has a rich, smoky flavor. While other dried chiles
  can be used for seasoning, the ancho provides an authentic flavor. I
  like to use a combination of chiles for seasoning tamales.
  
  Toast the dried chiles on a hot cast-iron griddle for a few minutes
  on each side. Be careful not to burn the chiles or they will have a
  bitter taste. As the chiles toast, they will become soft and pliable
  and may puff up. Put aside to cool. The chiles will become very crisp
  and brittle when cooled.
  
  When cool, remove the seeds and stems and crumble into small pieces.
  Put the pieces into a coffee mill or spice grinder and grind into a
  fine powder. Store the ground chile mix in a jar to use for seasoning
  other Mexican dishes.
  
  You can use a variety of meats for making tamales. I use either beef
  or chicken, but pork is traditional. I also use vegetable shortening,
  although again, lard is traditionally used in Mexico. Cut the meat
  into 1" to 2" chunks. Heat the lard or shortening in a heavy bottomed
  pot and brown the meat. When brown, add enough water to cover the
  meat and add the onions and garlic. Simmer until the meat is fork
  tender and flakes apart. For beef shoulder roast this will take about
  2 - 3 hours.
  
  While the meat is cooking, toast the cumin seeds on a cast iron
  griddle and then grind into a fine powder using a coffee mill or
  spice grinder and set aside.
  
  When the meat is cooked tender, set aside to cool. Separate the meat
  chunks >From the broth, reserving the broth. Shred the meat into
  small strands.
  
  Heat 2 tablespoons of lard or shortening in a heavy pan, preferably
  cast iron. Add the chile seasoning and cumin and stir for a few
  seconds. Add the meat and fry for two or three minutes. Add the
  reserved broth and simmer until the liquid level is reduced. The
  mixture should be soupy. Set aside to cool while you make the masa.

      Title: TAMALES NORTENOS 2 OF 2
 Categories: Pork, Beef, Mexican
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
 
  ~----THE MASA====================
        4 c  masa harina
        4 c  lukewarm water
        4 ts Wyler's granulated chicken
  :          boullion
        2 ts baking powder
        2 ts salt
    1 1/2 c  lard or vegetable
  :          shortening
  
  MASA Combine masa, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Dissolve the
  boullion in the lukewarm water to make a broth. Mix the broth into
  the masa a little at a time, working with your fingers to make a
  moist dough.
  
  In a small bowl, beat lard or shortening until fluffy, add to masa
  and beat until masa has a spongy texture.
  
  The Tamales
  
  Remove a soaked corn husk from the water and shake to remove excess
  water. Start with the largest husks because they will be easier to
  roll. If you end up with a lot of small husks, you can lay two
  together, overlapping about 1/2" but this is a little trickier and
  may take some practice. Lay the husk flat on a plate and spread about
  1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons (depending on the size of the husk) of masa in
  the center. Don't use too much! The easiest way to spread the masa is
  to spoon it onto the husk and spread it with your fingers. If the
  masa is sticky, wet your hands.
  
  Add about 1 tablespoon of meat filling on top of the masa. Again,
  don't use too much.
  
  Now comes the tricky part. Roll the corn husk so that the filling is
  enclosed in the masa. Don't worry if the filling is not completely
  surrounded with masa. When the masa cooks it will become firm and the
  tamale will be fine. Fold over each end. If the husks are very thick,
  you may find it difficult to fold the large end and get it to stay.
  If this is the case, don't worry about folding the large end and put
  that end up when you put the tamales into the steamer.
  
  Load the tamales into a steamer standing them up vertically. I use a
  large pot with a steamer basket in the bottom. When all the tamales
  are rolled, and the steamer is full, cover with a damp cloth and
  steam until the tamales are done, about 2 to 3 hours. During steaming
  it is very important to keep the water at a low boil. Also, DO NOT
  let the steamer boil out of water.
  
  TIP: Place a coin, a penny works good, in the bottom of the steamer
  with the water. You can tell when the water is boiling because you
  can hear the coin rattling around. If the coin stops rattling, the
  water has boiled away and you should add more.
  
  After about 2 hours, you may want to pull out a tamale and sample it.
  Let it cool for a few minutes and then unroll the husk. The tamale
  should be soft and firm and not mushy.

  the 1/2 cup water, mix well, and cook over low heat, covered, for 15
  minutes or until reduced to pulpy sauce.
  
  2.  Add salt, pepper, rice, and water.  Gently mix to fold the rice
  into the sauce.  Add butter and fold to coat the rice evenly. Cover
  tightly and steam the rice over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, or
  until the sauce is absorbed into the rice.  If you are garnishing the
  pilaf with fried potatoes, you can begin making them now while the
  rice is cooking. Turn off the heat, fluff the rice, and serve
  surrounded with fried potatoes or grated or sliced daikon radish if
  desired.
  
  Fried potatoes:
  
  4 tablespoons light vegetable oil 1 pound potatoes, diced into
  1/4-inch pieces with skin
  
  Note: I finally added some ghee to brown the potatoes, the vegetable
  oil just didn't do it alone.
  
  Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat until it is very
  hot. Add the potatoes and cook, turning and tossing, until they are
  browned and cooked (20-25 minutes). Remove with a slotted spoon and
  drain on paper towels.
  
  Note:  I folded Spicy Mushrooms with Ginger and Chilies into the

      Title: TAMIL NADU CURRY POWDER
 Categories: Sauces, Indian
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      2 tb Cumin seeds
      2 tb Black mustard seeds
    1/2 tb Fenugreek seeds
    1/2 tb Split urad dal
           -or yellow split peas
     25    Fresh curry leaves; or up to
     30    -Fresh curry leaves
      1 ts Black peppercorns
      6    Dry chili pods; or up to
      8    -Dry chili pods
    1/3 c  Ground coriander
      2 tb Ground turmeric
 
  Toast the cumin, black mustard, and fenugreek seeds, the split dal,
  and the fresh curry leaves as described below ("Preparing Ground
  Spices"). Add the peppercorns and chili pods and grind the mixture to
  a fine powder. Add the coriander and turmeric and mix well.
  
  PREPARING GROUND SPICES ======================= To toast spices on the
  stove top, place them in a dry, heavy-bottomed pan and cook them
  briefly (5 to 7 minutes) over low heat, stirring occasionally, until
  they darken and begin to release their aromas.  Heated mustard seeds
  will begin to pop, and may jump out of the pan, so have a lid ready.
  Oven toasting takes somewhat longer; spread the ingredients on a dry
  cookie sheet and place in an oven preheated to 200 F; stir every five
  minutes or so. Grind toasted ingredients to a powder with a mortar
  and pestle, spice grinder, coffee mill (not the same one you use for
  coffee), or a blender, the pass them through a fine sieve.
  Transferred immediately to a glass container and stored away from
  moisture, light, and heat, toasted and ground spices can maintain
  their flavor as long as four months.

  mix 1 part tequila, 1 part 151 rum to 2 parts Amaretto) WARNING: This
  is Strong Shit. One glass is equivalent to six shots of good whiskey.
  For a watered down version you may want to add, you guessed it water.
  I prefer carbonated lemon flavored water.

  "Following the example of the prophet Muhammad, Muslims break their
  fast with dates every Ramadan evening as the call to prayer echoes
  across the desert. In Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States, the bedouin
  heritage lingers in the dates that are offered as a welcome to
  guests, along with a tiny handless cup of green cardamom coffee.
  Varieties known as Red Sugar, Bride's Finger, Mother of Perfume, and
  Pure Daughter are served whole or stuffed with nuts and other fruits.
  Among the multitude of traditional foods prepared from dates are date
  syrup and preserves, date bread and doughnuts, puddings, breakfast
  porridges, sweet rice, and meat and fish dishes. The date palm has
  become a symbol of Arab hospitality and culture and forms part of the
  national emblem of Saudi Arabia as well as the symbol of the national
  airline, Saudia."
  
  * thin sheets of sun-dried apricots
  
  1. Cut apricots into pieces. With oiled hands, knead the pistachios
  with the apricots, sugar, and rosewater, until a pasty dough is
  formed.
  
  2. Stuff each date with a spoonful of the apricot pistachio mixture.
  Roll in sugar.

      Title: TANDOORI CHICKEN (DE WITT)
 Categories: Indian, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
    1/2 c  Fresh lime juice
      4 ts Ground cayenne pepper
      1 tb Ground paprika
      1 sm Onion, chopped
      5    Cloves garlic
      1 tb Peeled, chopped ginger root
      2 ts Coriander seeds, crushed
      1 ts Cumin seeds
    1/2 ts Turmeric
      1 c  Nonfat yogurt
      3 lb Chicken, skinned and trimmed
           -of fat
 
  This famed chicken "barbecue" from northern India is traditionally
  prepared in a tandoor, an underground jar-shaped clay oven that
  believed to have originated in Persia. The oven can be heated to very
  high temperatures, which sears the chicken and seals in the juices.
  Equally delicious results can be obtained in a conventional oven or
  on a covered grill. The yogurt marinade keeps the chicken from drying
  out.
  
  Combine 1/4 cup lime juice, cayenne, paprika, onion, garlic, ginger,
  coriander, cumin and turmeric in a blender or food processor and
  blend for several minutes, or until the mixture forms a smooth paste.
  Transfer the mixture to a bowl and stir in the remaining 1/4 cup lime
  juice and yogurt.
  
  Place chicken in a shallow non aluminum dish. Make deep gashes in the
  flesh and stuff with the yogurt mixture. Rub the rest of the yogurt
  mixture over the chicken, cover and marinate for 8 to 24 hours in the
  refrigerator.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place the chicken on a lightly oiled
  rack over a roasting pan. Reserve any marinade that doesn't cling to
  the bird for basting. Bake the chicken, basting occasionally, for 1
  hour, or until the juices run clear when the bird is pierced with a
  fork.
  
  Alternatively, to grill the chicken, prepare a charcoal fire. When the
  coals are hot, push them to the outsides of the grill. Place a drip
  pan in the center and bank the coals around it. Place a lightly oiled
  cooking rack on top. Set the chicken on the rack over the drip pan.
  Cover and cook for 1 1/2 to 1 1/4 hours, or unto the juices run clear
  when the bird is pierced With a fork. Watch the coals and the chicken
  closely and add more coals as necessary, taking care the chicken does
  not overcooks

      3    Chicken breasts, halved

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
      1 md Sliced onion
      2    Lemons
 
     Make the marinade first.  Put the chopped onions, garlic, ginger,
  and lemon juice in an electric blender and blend to a smooth paste.
  Place this in a bowl large enough to accommodate the chicken. Add the
  yogurt, coriander, cumin, turmeric, garam masala,m mace, nutmeg,
  cloves, cinnamon, olive oil, salt, black pepper, and cayenn. Mix
  thouroughly.
     Skin chicken legs and breasts.  With a sharp knife make 3 diagonal
  slashes on each breast section, going halfway down to the bone. Make 2
  diagonal slashes on each thigh halfway to the bone. Make 4 or 5 jabs
  on each drumstick.
     Put the chicken in the marinade and rub the marinade into the
  slashes with your finger.  Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours,
  turning 4 or 5 times.
     About 1 1/2 hours before serving, light charcoal.
     Peel onion for garnishing and slice paper-thin. Separate rings
  into ice water and chill.
     Grill chicken 7 or 8 minutes on each side, then raise the grill
  and cook another 15 to 20 minutes on each side. Baste with marinade
  as you cook.
     Warm a large platter.  Place chicken pieces on platter - drain
  onion rings and lay on top.  Quarter lemons lengthwise and place them
  around chicken - the chicken is good with extra lemon juice squeezed
  on.

      Title: TANDOORI PASTE
 Categories: Low, Fat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Nonfat yogurt (active
           Cultures are good)
           Several cloves garlic
           Several pieces chopped fresh
           Ginger
           Few chopped hot green
           Chilies (seeds or not is up
           To you)
           Turmeric
           Cayenne pepper or paprika
           Garam masala
 
  In a blender:
  
  I've been unspecific with the measures, because the balance of spices
  in this is kind of up to the cook...there are probably other
  ingredients besides these in the commercial tandoori paste, but these
  are the essentials as I remember them.
  
  Anyway, to prepare the food, marinate whatever you'll be cooking in a
  mixture of lemon juice and salt for about 1/2 hr. Then add the lemon
  juice/salt to the stuff in the blender and whirl it up. When you lean
  over to sniff it should bite back, hard. Pour the tandoori paste over
  the food, let it sit for up to two hours. Then (for eggplant slices,
  for example) toss on the grill still lightly coated with the tandoori
  mixture (messy) OR for something big like a head of cauliflower, wrap
  in tinfoil, slathering a lot of the paste over the top before closing
  it up. Bake until it's almost done, and then open the tinfoil to let
  it dry out a bit while it finishes baking.
  
  If you want really bright red, mix some red and yellow food coloring
  and paint it onto the food during the lemon and salt phase.

  Make the tangine: In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat.
  Add the onions and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned, about
  6 to 8 minutes. Add the bell pepper, garlic, turmeric, ginger,
  cinnamon, salt, cayenne, and saffron, and stir for 1 minute. Stir in
  the carrots, squash, tomatoes with their juice, and vegetable stock,
  breaking up the tomatoes with the spoon.  Bring to a simmer over high
  heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes,
  until the vegetables are just tender. Stir in the zuchinni, garbanzo
  beans, and raisins. Cover and continue cooking until the squash is
  tender, about 5 to 10 minutes. Make the couscous: Meanwhile, in a
  large saucepan, combine the water, oil, and salt and bring to a boil
  over high heat. Stir in the couscous. Immediately remove from the
  heat, cover, and let stand until the couscous has absorbed all the
  liquid, about 5 minutes. Place the couscous on a warmed serving
  platter and make a well in the center. With a slotted spoon, spoon
  the vegetables into the well. Pour the tangine cooking juices over
  the couscous, sprinkle with the almonds, and serve.

 Categories: Digest, Mcdougall, Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     15 oz Can garbanzo
           -beans, drained & rinsed
      2    Scallions, chopped
      3 tb Water
      2 tb Soy sauce
      3 ts Grated fresh ginger
      1 ts Rice vinegar
    1/2 ts Honey
           -Dash or two Tabasco
 
  Combine all ingredients in food processor or blender and process until
  smooth and creamy.
  
  Review by kjb2@postoffice.mail.cornell.edu (Kathy Brese): "I made
  this one and IMHO it was pretty awful! I really didn't like the
  flavor of the ginger with the garbanzos. I think my tastebuds
  expected cumin, not ginger. I did let it sit a few days to see if it
  needed time to mellow, but it still tasted yucky to me." From:
  "Anne.Cox" <20676AC@msu.edu> "I agree! We didn't like the
  ginger-garbanzo combo at all, and it got worse and worse as it aged
  in the fridge...the raccoons climbed into the compost to eat it,
  though. I didn't like the mushroom dip/puree thing at all, either."

      1 sm Package enoki mushrooms
      5    To 6 large dried Shitake
           Mushrooms
      1 lg Can straw mushrooms
      3    To 4 black fungus mushrooms
           Or any variety of mushroom
           You're comfy with--I
           Used a dried version of
           These and they became huge!
      8 c  Water
    1/4 c  Dry sherry or rice wine
    1/3 c  Cider vinegar
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2    To 3 egg whites
      3    Sliced scallions
    1/4    To 1/2 tsp. white pepper
      2 tb Cornstarch
 
  Boil 2 cups of the water and pour it over the Shitake and fungus and
  any ever other dried mushrooms you may have chosen. Let this sit in a
  bowl for 30 minutes. When the mushrooms have finished soaking,
  squeeze the juice out of them and cut them into bit sized pieces; do
  not use the stems. Pour the soaking juice into a large soup pan with
  5 1/2 cups of water. Bring the water and all the mushrooms EXCEPT the
  enoki mushrooms to a boil.
  
  Add rice wine or sherry, soy sauce and vinegar. Reduce the heat and
  allow mixture to simmer for at least 10 minutes. (If you're trying to
  get other dishes to come out at the same time, this is a good place
  to just let the mixture simmer till you're ready for it!)
  
  Mix the cornstarch and the remaining 1/2 cup of cool water in a cup.
  Wisk the mixture into the hot soup... this is the possible lump
  stage, but with all the mushrooms and egg whites, who will know?).
  
  Drizzle the egg whites into the soup, whisking or stirring
  constantly. Add the white pepper.
  
  Wait 2-3 minutes and then dish up the soup, garnishing each bowl with
  scallions and enoki mushrooms.  (These last add a lot of flavor!)

      Title: TANGY RED BULGAR
 Categories: Vegetarian, Slow cooker
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 tb Olive or vegetable oil
      1 c  Chopped red or green bell
           -pepper, or combination
      1 c  Chopped zucchini or yellow
           -squash, or both
  2 1/4 c  Bloody Mary mix or
           -vegetable juice
      1 c  Bulgur wheat
      1 tb Lemon juice
      1 ts Dired basil, crushed, or 1
           -tablespoon fresh, minced
    1/3 c  Chopped green onions
 
  Heat oil in large saucepan over medium heat.  Cook pepper(s) and
  squash(es) until tendercrisp, 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  
  Stir in Bloody Mary mix or vegetable juice, bulgur, lemon juice, and
  basil. Heat to boiling.  Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer 5 to 8
  minutes or until liquid is absorbed, stirring occasionally.
  
  Garnish with green onions.  May be served warm or as a salad at room
  temperature.
  
  To Microwave:
  
  In a 2quart microwavesafe casserole dish, combine oil, red pepper and
  zucchini.  Cover with lid; microwave on high 4 minutes or until
  vegetables are tendercrisp, stirring twice during cooking.
  
  Add vegetable juice, bulgur, lemon juice, and basil. Cover and
  microwave 10 minutes or until liquid is absorbed, stirring twice
  during cooking. Let stand, covered, 5 minutes. Garnish with green
  onions.
  
  Crockpot:
  
  I have made this in a crockpot, tossing all the ingredients except the
  basil and green onions in and cooking on low for 8 hours, adding the
  basil after 7.5 hours, and garnishing with green onions just before
  serving. The resulting dish is indistinguishable from one made using
  the stove top method.  I refuse to try the microwave method. I
  generally use only two cups of Bloody Mary mix since the brand I buy
  comes in quart bottles.

      Title: TANGY SALMON MOUSSE
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    418 g  Canned pink Alaska salmon
     15 g  Gelatine
     50 g  Smoked salmon
           -- finely chopped
  1 1/2 ts Minced fresh root ginger
    150 ml Greek strained yogurt
    175 g  Curd cheese or Quark
      2    Egg whites
      2 lg Grapefruits
      1 tb Walnut oil
      2 tb Grapefruit juice
           Mixed colored salad leaves
           Avocado for garnish
 
  Drain the can of salmon. Heat the juice to almost boiling then
  sprinkle over the gelatine. Stir gently until completely dissolved.
  
  Mash the two types of salmon into a bowl and beat in the yogurt,
  cheese and 1 teaspoon of the ginger. Stir in the dissolved gelatine
  and cool until the mixture is just beginning to set. Whisk the egg
  whites until they form stiff peaks. Fold these into the salmon
  mixture then pour into a single 900ml / 1 1/2 pint fish mold or two
  450ml / 3/4 pint moulds. Put into a refrigerator and leave until
  completely set.
  
  Peel the grapefruits and remove the pith from around each segment.
  Put the segments into a bowl along with the remaining ginger, walnut
  oil and grapefruit juice. Mix well and allow to stand for about 1
  hour to marinade. Arrange the salad leaves and avocado on serving
  plates and very carefully turn the mousse out onto them. Just before
  serving, arrange the marinaded grapefruit segments onto the salad and
  sprinkle the juices over.
  
  Cook's Note: To turn out the mousses more easily, first dip the
  moulds into hot water to loosen the sides then invert them onto the
  serving plates. Pick up the plates and very gently shake from side to
  side. The mousses should drop out.
  
  Serves 8-10. Approx. 130 kcals per serving
