           Chocolate Glaze
      4 tb Unsalted Butter
      3 tb Light Corn Syrup
      4 oz Semi-Sweet Chocolate broken
      2 tb Coffee, Room Temp.
      1 tb Rum
 
  Vegetable oil
  
  1. Place oven rack in center of oven; heat to 350~F. Coat sides and
  ends of 15-1/2 x 10-1/2 x 1 inch jellly-roll pan with oil; line pan
  with oiled parchment or waxed paper, overhanging 1 inch on one end of
  the pan. Reserve. 2. Melt chocolate with 2 tablespoons of the
  espresso and the creme de cacao. 3. Beat egg yolks in medium mixer
  bowl at high speed 1 minute; gradually beat in granulated sugar.
  Continue beating until mix- ture is pale yellow and slightly thick;
  about 3 minutes. Gradu- ally beat chocolate mixture into egg-yolk
  mixture. 4. Beat egg whites in large mixer bowl at high speed until
  stiff but not dry peaks form. Fold chocolate mixture thoroughly into
  whites. 5. Spread mixture in reserved pan in even layer using the
  back of a large wet spoon. Bake 15 minutes. 6. Transfer pan to wire
  rack and cover with a slightly dampened lightweight kitchen towel;
  cool to room temperature. (Cake can be set aside covered at room
  temperature 2 to 3 hours). Remove towel. 7. Overlap, side by side,
  two 16-inch sheets of waxed paper on work surface. Sprinkle top of
  cake evenly with cocoa.  Loosen sides and ends of cake. Invert cake
  onto waxed paper; remove pan and peel parchment liner from cake.
  Reserve cake. 8. Whip cream in chilled mixer bowl at high sped until
  soft peaks form. Add powdered sugar and vanilla.  Continue beating
  cream while drizzling in remaining 3 tablespoons espresso; beat until
  stiff peaks form. 9. Spoon whipped cream onto cake; spread evenly,
  leaving 1-inch border of cake uncovered along one long side and both
  ends. Beginning with the long side covered with cream, carefully roll
  up cake jelly-roll fashion (use the waxed paper to help turn the
  roll, but do not roll paper into the cake). Work as gently as
  possible. (Cake will crack a bit on the sides) <snicker>. Then roll
  entire cake snugly in waxed paper; place seam-side down on baking
  sheet. Refrigerate until well chilled, about 2 hours. 10. Prepare
  Chocolate Glaze. 11. Wile glaze is cooling, fold a 15 x 7-1/2 inch
  piece of parchment paper wit a letter-fold to form a triple-thickness
  15 x 2-1/2 inch strip. Place wire rack (or two small racks) long
  enough to accommodate length of roll, on baking sheet, and place
  parchment strip lengthwise on rack. Remove waxed paper from cake;
  place cake seam-side down on parchment strip <snicker, snicker>. 12.
  Pour Chocolate Glaze very slowly over cake to coat evenly; use a
  spatula to spread around bottom curve of cake. (Scrape glaze
  drippings from baking sheet with spatula into small bowl; let stand 3
  minutes.  Drizzle crosswise over cake at 1/2 inch intervals, building
  up smooth ridges, if desired.) 13. Refrigerate cake until glaze sets,
  about 45 minutes. Transfer cake to serving platter <many more
  snickers>. Cut roll cross- wise into 1 to 1-1/2 inch slices. Serve
  immediately.
  
  Chocolate Glaze 1. Measure butter, coffee, rum and corn syrup into
  small saucepan. Heat over low heat to boiling; boil slowly, stirring
  constantly, 1 minute. Remove from heat. 2. Stir in chocolate and
  whisk until smooth. Let stand until glaze cools and thickly coats a
  wooden spoon dipped into it, about 12 minutes. Use immediately.

      Title: QUEEN IDA'S CHICKEN & SAUSAGE GUMBO
 Categories: Cajun, Gumbo, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
     48 oz Chicken broth
  6 1/2 c  Water (see note)
  3 1/2    Chicken *
           Stalks of 1 bunch parsley,
           -chopped
    1/4 md Yellow onion
      1 tb Salt, or to taste
      1 tb Cayenne
  1 1/2 ts Black pepper
           Oil
      1 c  To 1 1/4 cups roux, at room
           -temperature
  1 1/2 lb Smoked sausages or smoked
           -links **
      1 c  Chopped parley leaves
    3/4 c  Chopped green onions
    1/2 c  Chopped celery
           About 1 1/2 teaspoons file
           -powder
           Cooked rice (about 8 cups)
 
  * cut into serving pieces, with neck and upper back separated **
  (spicy or mild), cut into 1/2-inch slices
  
  The amount of roux needed to thicken this gumbo will vary with the
  type of chicken used, since some of the liquid will evaporate during
  the long cooking needed with a stewing hen or a large roaster. If
  using small frier pieces that cook quickly, use 1 1/4 cup roux; if
  using a larger or tougher chicken, use just 1 cup. For the richest
  flavor, start the stock cooking first, and let it simmer while you
  measure and cut up the other ingredients.
  
  Bring chicken broth and the water to a boil in a large stockpot. Add
  the neck and back (and wingtips, heart, gizzard and feet, if
  desired), the parsley stalks and the yellow onion. Return to a boil;
  skim, reduce heat, and simmer while preparing other ingredients.
  
  Mix together the salt, cayenne and black pepper, and season the
  remaining chicken pieces on both sides with the mixture (reserving
  any extra seasoning).
  
  Film a large skillet with oil and, over high heat, lightly saute the
  chicken pieces on both sides just until they begin to color. (Or, you
  can broil chicken briefly, about 5 minutes per side, turning once.)
  Do not totally brown the chicken; cook it only long enough to tighten
  the meat and seal in the juices. Reserve chicken pieces. (Add any
  juice from the bottom of the broiling pan to the stock.)
  
  Return stock to a boil, remove from heat and, stirring strongly,
  blend in a large spoonful of the room-temperature roux. Return pot to
  low heat so the liquid bubbles gently but does not boil, and
  gradually stir in the remaining roux, a little at a time, until the
  liquid thickens slightly. This process will take 5 to 10 minutes.
  
  Add sausages and parley to the stock and simmer, uncovered, for 20 to
  30 minutes.
  
  Drop the chicken pieces carefully into the stock, add any reserved
  seasonings, and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 20 to 30
  minutes.  Adjust heat to maintain a steady simmer; DO NOT BOIL.
  
  Add green onions and celery and continue to simmer until chicken is
  cooked through but not yet falling off the bone (about 15 minutes
  longer for a fryer, 1 hour longer if using a tough stewing hen). As
  chicken simmers, tilt the pot and, using a large metal spoon, skim
  excess fat from the surface of the broth.  Taste carefully and
  correct seasonings if needed. Remove any chicken parts you don't want
  to serve (such as feet, neck, upper back).  [Do NOT remove if you're
  gonna serve it to ME... S.C.] If liquid has gotten too thick (it
  should not be as thick as a stew), stir in a little more broth or
  water and simmer briefly to blend flavors. Serve gumbo hot over a
  mound of rice.
  
  NOTE:  if there is no time to simmer the neck and back, replace water
  with a light (uncondensed) chicken broth.
  
  Serves 5 or 6.
  
  GUMBO FILE:
  
  Sprinkle about 1/4 teaspoon file power into each person's empty gumbo
  bowl, then spoon in the gumbo and rice and stir together.
  
  CHICKEN OKRA GUMBO:
  
  Wash 1 pound okra, trim off the heads and tough tails, and cut into
  1/4-inch slices.  Make gumbo as above, but decrease roux to 2/3 cup.
  Once the roux has been stirred into the liquid, add all the okra at
  once. (Gumbo liquid will suddenly become much thicker.) Proceed as
  above, cooking the gumbo for at least 45 minutes after adding the
  okra, or until okra is very tender.  Although gumbos combining both
  okra and file powder are rare, file powder may be sprinkled into the
  gumbo bowls if desired.

  Bring chicken broth and the water to a boil in a large stockpot. Add
  the neck and back (and wingtips, heart, gizzard and feet, if
  desired), the parsley stalks and the yellow onion. Return to a boil;
  skim, reduce heat, and simmer while preparing other ingredients.
  
  Mix together the salt, cayenne and black pepper, and season the
  remaining chicken pieces on both sides with the mixture (reserving
  any extra seasoning).
  
  Film a large skillet with oil and, over high heat, lightly saute the
  chicken pieces on both sides just until they begin to color. (Or, you
  can broil chicken briefly, about 5 minutes per side, turning once.)
  Do not totally brown the chicken; cook it only long enough to tighten
  the meat and seal in the juices. Reserve chicken pieces. (Add any
  juice from the bottom of the broiling pan to the stock.)
  
  Return stock to a boil, remove from heat and, stirring strongly,
  blend in a large spoonful of the room-temperature roux. Return pot to
  low heat so the liquid bubbles gently but does not boil, and
  gradually stir in the remaining roux, a little at a time, until the
  liquid thickens slightly. This process will take 5 to 10 minutes.
  
  Add sausages and parley to the stock and simmer, uncovered, for 20 to
  30 minutes.
  
  Drop the chicken pieces carefully into the stock, add any reserved
  seasonings, and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 20 to 30
  minutes.  Adjust heat to maintain a steady simmer; DO NOT BOIL.
  
  Add green onions and celery and continue to simmer until chicken is
  cooked through but not yet falling off the bone (about 15 minutes
  longer for a fryer, 1 hour longer if using a tough stewing hen). As
  chicken simmers, tilt the pot and, using a large metal spoon, skim
  excess fat from the surface of the broth.  Taste carefully and
  correct seasonings if needed. Remove any chicken parts you don't want
  to serve (such as feet, neck, upper back).  [Do NOT remove if you're
  gonna serve it to ME... S.C.] If liquid has gotten too thick (it
  should not be as thick as a stew), stir in a little more broth or
  water and simmer briefly to blend flavors. Serve gumbo hot over a
  mound of rice.
  
  NOTE:  if there is no time to simmer the neck and back, replace water
  with a light (uncondensed) chicken broth.
  
  Serves 5 or 6.
  
  GUMBO FILE:
  
  Sprinkle about 1/4 teaspoon file power into each person's empty gumbo
  bowl, then spoon in the gumbo and rice and stir together.
  
  CHICKEN OKRA GUMBO:
  
  Wash 1 pound okra, trim off the heads and tough tails, and cut into
  1/4-inch slices.  Make gumbo as above, but decrease roux to 2/3 cup.
  Once the roux has been stirred into the liquid, add all the okra at
  once. (Gumbo liquid will suddenly become much thicker.) Proceed as
  above, cooking the gumbo for at least 45 minutes after adding the
  okra, or until okra is very tender.  Although gumbos combining both
  okra and file powder are rare, file powder may be sprinkled into the
  gumbo bowls if desired.

      Title: QUEEN IDA'S ROUX
 Categories: Cajun, Condiments, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Oil
      2 c  Flour
 
  Here's a little something for when you get tired of all that
  disgusting smoked salmon...  Had a real treat in the food section
  from the SF Chron last Wednesday. There was a big article on Queen
  Ida along with her recipe for gumbo.  She has a cookbook out++how
  that escaped me I have no idea. It's called "Cookin' With Queen Ida".
  
  Once roux has started to color, never leave the stove: ignore
  telephones, doorbells, children and the pets, and keep stirring. If a
  roux burns (it will develop a burned smell and blackened patches),
  throw it out and start over.  Roux can't be rushed, it's a gradual
  process and needs patience. When cooked too rapidly, roux may brown
  but it won't develop its characteristic flavor. When roux is done, it
  will smell like well-cooked flour; it may taste and smell slightly
  bitter when sampled 'as is', but this doesn't mean it is burned.
  
  Mix oil and flour in a heavy cast-iron skillet.  Do NOT use a
  nonstick-coated pan.  If mixture is not as soft as pancake batter,
  add more oil.
  
  Cook over low to medium heat, stirring gently but constantly with a
  wooden spoon, scraping roux from bottom and sides of skillet. If any
  lumps develop, whisk with a wire whisk until they break up. Cook
  until the color is almost a mahogany or chile powder red-brown. This
  will take from 30 to 60 minutes, depending on your pan and heat of
  your stove. Be patient.
  
  After the roux is done, remove from heat to cool, but keep stirring
  constantly for the first few minutes. Then stir frequently for 10
  minutes longer, since roux will continue to cook from its own heat
  for a few minutes.  As the roux cools, some of the oil will float to
  the top. Spoon it off.
  
  Turn roux into a container, and store in the refrigerator. Before
  using, skim off any oil that has separated out, and let roux come to
  room temperature.
  
  NOTE:  If you do a lot of Creole cooking, you can double or triple the
  recipe.  It will take longer to cook, of course.

      Title: QUEEN OF BREAD PUDDINGS
 Categories: Desserts, Fruit
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Breadcrumbs -- (3 oz)
      2 tb Sugar
      1 tb Margarine -- (1/2 oz)
      2 c  Hot milk -- (1 pint)
      2    Eggs
    1/2 ts Vanilla essence or a pinch
           Spice
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 tb Softened red jam -- (2 to
      3    )
 
  Put the breadcrumbs, sugar and margarine in a bowl and pour on the hot
  milk.  Leave to soak for a few minutes. Separate the egg yolks and
  whites; beat the yolks and add to the milk mixture. Add flavouring
  and salt. Pour into a greased 1 litre (2 pint) pie dish or baking
  dish and cook until set, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and
  allow to stand for a few minutes.  Meanwhile beat the egg whites and
  make the meringue with 2-4 Tbs sugar, according to taste. Soften the
  jam by warming or adding a little hot water. Spread jam on top of
  pudding and cover with meringue. Bake until the meringue is lightly
  coloured, 15 - 20 minutes. Serve hot or cold. Banana: Make in the
  same way as Queen of Puddings, but add a mashed banana to the bread
  mixture.  Mashed banana may also be mixed with the jam to spread on
  top, or cover the top with sliced banana and omit the jam.
  Butterscotch: Use the same recipe as Queen of Puddings, but with 1/2
  cup (4 oz) brown sugar instead of the white sugar, and heat it with
  the margarine until the sugar melts. Dissolve this in the hot milk
  before proceeding in the usual way. Chocolate: Use the Queen of
  Pudding recipe, adding an extra tablespoon of sugar and 4 level Tbs
  cocoa to the breadcrumbs Coconut: Use the Queen of Pudding recipe,
  adding 1/2 cup desiccated coconut to the crumbs. Orange or Lemon:
  Use the Queen of Pudding recipe, adding the grated rind of one orange
  or lemon.  Leave out the vanilla or spice and use marmalade instead
  of jam.

      Title: QUEMADA SALSA
 Categories: Sauces, Preserves
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Tomatoes -- cored
      1 bn Green onions -- trimmed and
           Washed
    1/2 bn Fresh cilantro
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      3    Serrano chiles -- stemmed
      1 tb Garlic puree
      1 tb Lime juice
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground white pepper
    1/2 ts Ground oregano
      1 c  Water
 
  "Quemada" literally means "burnt" -- and that is what is done to the
  tomatoes and green onions, giving the salsa a smoky flavor and rich
  color.
  
  Place tomatoes and green onions on a hot mesquite grill (over hot
  coals, not flames).  Pile the cilantro on top, so that it does not
  touch the grill.  Grill the vegetables 10 to 15 minutes, or until the
  peppers are soft. Place the vegetable oil in a saute pan over
  medium-high heat. Add the serranos and saute until the peppers are
  soft. Place the serranos, tomatoes, onion, and cilantro in a food
  processor fitted with the metal blade.  Process until coarsely
  ground. Remove tomato mixture to mixing bowl and stir until
  ingredients are evenly distributed. In a separate bowl, mix garlic,
  lime juice, salt, white pepper, oregano, and water until well-
  blended.  Add garlic mixture to ground vegetables and mix thoroughly.
  Makes about 3 cups.

 Categories: Low fat, Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           None
 
  We have quiche here in South Africa. I make a crustless quiche - much
  quicker, easier & lower fat
  :).  What this means in practice is that, instead of making pastry
  for the quiche, add a tablespoon of flour to your egg & milk custard
  mixture, beat well to remove lumps and pour this over the fillings
  which are placed in the dish (give the dish a spray of non-stick
  baking spray). Cook as normal. During baking, the flour sinks to the
  bottom of the custard to form a mock crust. I have made this using
  ordinary white & wholwheat flour, as well as corn & potato flour.

  Quite awhile ago, someone was looking for Gluten-Free recipes. Since
  I have developed severe allergies to grains, it was suggested to me
  by someone here on the echo that it could be the gluten content that
  was giving me trouble.  So I decided to try the gluten-free grains.
  The gluten-free grains do not interchange readily in baking recipes.
  A few days ago, I happened upon THE GLUTEN-FREE GOURMET Living Well
  Without Wheat by Bette Hagman at the Half Price Book Store. This book
  is a real gem and I hope whoever was looking for gluten-free recipes
  sees this msg. We have tried a couple of the recipes and they really
  are pretty tasty--- I hadn't eaten a bakery item in over 3 months!
  Here is the muffin recipe that I made on Easter morning and everyone
  thought they were good.
  
  In the mixing bowl, cream together sugar and shortening. Then beat in
  the eggs.  Sift together the flour, salt, and baking powder and add
  to the egg mixture alternately with the milk.  Don't overbeat. Stir
  in the vanilla. These are best mixed by hand. Pour into greased
  muffin cups. Bake in preheated 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes.
  Makes 8 muffins.

    1/2 c  Onion ;  dried minced
 
  Are you looking for a pepperoni dinner roll? Sorry, I don't have a
  recipe for those, but I have a recipe for pepperoni puffs. I use
  these for at cocktail parties. If you like pepperoni, these are very
  easy and delicious. They always disappear fast. Add enough hot water
  to cover minced onion and let soak a few minutes until softened.
  Drain well. Chop pepperoni in food processor.  Blend grated cheddar,
  pepperoni and onions in small bowl. Add enough mayonnaise to moisten
  well. Divide crescent rolls into four rectangles tangles, pinching
  perforations together. Leaving a 1/2 inch border all around each
  rectangle, spread the pepperoni mixture between borders.  Roll up
  each rectangle into a log, pinching seams on all edges. Cut each log
  into 1 inch rounds. Then cut each round in half. Put rounds into
  greased miniature muffin tins.  Bake at 375 degrees for 8 minutes.
  Remove immediately from tins using a spoon. Serve warm. (Can be
  frozen and reheated).The variations you can add to this are
  endless.Just to name a few: 1.Chopped green olives
         2.Chopped Ripe olives 3.chopped canned mushrooms 4.grated
  mozzarella cheese 5.grated Muenster cheese 6.crumbled Italian
  seasonings I hope someone else will post something that you can use.

      Title: QUICK & EASY SPICY SOY SAUCE
 Categories: Digest, Oct.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
        x  Soy sauce
        x  Garlic powder
        x  Powdered ginger
        x  Sesame oil
        x  Hot oil
 
  I tend to cook without recipes and with a real eye to quickness. In
  other words, I'm lazy. Thought I'd share a couple ideas I've come up
  with recently (obviously I never measure anything--sorry).
  
  To a partly-full bottle of soy sauce, I add some garlic powder and
  some powdered ginger and a little sesame oil and hot oil. I keep this
  around (haven't needed to refrigerate it), shake it up and sprinkle a
  bit over steamed vegetables (my favorite is green cabbage, sliced
  finely). A little goes a long way so I think the fat from the oils is
  negligible. The flavor they add is significant.

      Title: QUICK AVGOLEMONO SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Greek
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  White rice, cooked
      3 c  Chicken broth
      1    Lemon, juiced
      2 lg Eggs
 
  If you don't have any leftover white rice, put about 1
      1/2    cup of rice on to cook.
  
  Heat the chicken broth to boiling.  While the chicken broth is
  heating, beat together the lemon juice and eggs in a small bowl or
  glass measuring cup until uniform in color.
  
  When the chicken broth is boiling, stir in the cooked rice. Remove
  from heat and stir briskly while slowly pouring the egg mixture into
  the pot from about a foot in the air. The soup should end up
  resembling a cream soup and there should be no large, visible threads
  of egg.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Greek egg-lemon soup -- This is a perfect way to use up a little
  leftover rice.
  
  *  This recipe even works well with canned chicken broth since the
  lemon covers up the "canned" flavor.
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy
  : Time:  20 minutes if you have to cook the rice, 10 minutes if you
  don't. : Precision:  No need to measure.

 Categories: Digest, July
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           None
 
  A variation on the burger mixes... I mixed the Felafel mix acc. to
  directions (add water, wait 15 mins) and then made them into patties
  and browned a couple of minutes on each side on nonstick pans. My
  mother & I thought it was delicious :-) altho maybe not very
  original. As lowfat as chickpeas are (I forget exactly but it says on
  the box), fairly cheap if you buy in bulk or on sale.

      Title: QUICK CHICKEN WING SAUCE
 Categories: Kohl, Sauces, Kooknet
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Medium or Hot Salsa/Picante
      3 tb Honey
      1 tb Lemon juice
           Red Devil Hot Sauce
           Dry Mustard
 
  Measurements are not exact!  You'll have to experiment until you get
  the taste YOU want.  For a small amount of this sauce, start with one
  cup of Salsa.  Add about 3 T honey, 1 T lemon juice (don't need this,
  but it adds some tartness), and a few shakes of Red Devil hot sauce
  (or Tabasco). Instead of Red Devil or Tabasco, use dry mustard which
  doesn't "take over" the sauce as much as Red Devil or Tabasco.
  
  Mix well.  Taste.  If not hot enough, use Hot Salsa or Hot Picante
  and/or add more Red Devil.

      Title: QUICK CHOCOLATE PUDDING (LACTO)
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Nonfat milk
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 tb Cocoa
      3 tb Sugar*
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  Whisk first four ingredients together in a saucepan (you want to make
  sure that the cornstarch is dissolved!). Turn heat to medium. Cook
  until mixture is hot, stirring the entire time (don't let it boil).
  Turn heat to low and cook until pudding thickens. Remove from heat.
  Stir in vanilla. Eat.
  
  This recipe doesn't get as puddinglike as instant, but even if it
  totally fails, it makes a great thick hot chocolate. Also, according
  to my calculations, it has not much more than 100 calories for AN
  ENTIRE CUP. It has never failed to cure my chocolate cravings.
  
  *I start with 2 tablespoons sugar and add more to taste. I forget how
  much was in the recipe to start with, but it was too much.

      Yield: 18 Servings
 
      1 c  Water
      1 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Butter
  6 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Sugar
    3/4 ts Salt
      2    Envelopes Instant Yeast
      1    Large Egg
      4 tb Butter
      4 tb Brown sugar
      2 tb Honey
    1/4 c  Butter, softened
 
  Combine water, milk and butter in a bowl and microwave on full power
  for 90 seconds to 2 minutes (120 to 125 degrees F on candy
  thermometer). Combine 2 cups flour, sugar, salt and yeast in food
  procesor or mixer and process or mix for 10 seconds to mix well. With
  processor or mixer running, pour the warm liquid into the flour, add
  the egg and process for 20 seconds. Stop processor and add 2 1/2 cups
  of flour, process 40 seconds. If using mixer, switch to dough hook
  and mix for 2 minutes. Turn sticky dough onto floured board.
  Gradually add enough of the rest of the flour and knead only until
  the dough is not sticky but is still soft. Cover with a mixing bowl
  and let rest 15 minutes. It should be bubbling happily by then.
  Generously grease 2 8 inch square or round pans. Melt 2 Tablespoons
  of butter in each pan and add 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar and 1
  Tablespoon of honey. Sprinkle cinnamon over butter mixture. Divide
  the dough in half. Roll 1 half into a 10 x 20 inch rectangle on a
  floured board. Brush with the softened butter and spread with
  cinnamon and brown sugar. Roll up like a jelly roll stretch slightly
  by pulling on the ends to even thickness. Press lightly along edge to
  seal. Using a floured knife, cut into rolls. Place in prepared pan
  with cut sides down. Repeat with other half. Cover with clean
  tea-towel and place in an unheated oven with a pan of hot water on
  the bottom rack. Let rise for 40 minutes. Before baking, remove pan
  of water and rolls. Heat oven to 375 F. Bake rolls for 20 to 25
  minutes or until just golden brown. Turn out onto tray or piece of
  waxed paper. Tips: Use a candy thermometer to check temperature of
  water. May be proofed in the microwave on low for 10 minutes instead
  of in regular oven. Let dough rest for 15 minutes before baking. A
  1000 watt microwave was used, times may need to be adjusted.
  Sometimes, 40 minutes rising is too long, if the dough starts to look
  like it is going to overflow then cook it right away. Nuts, raisins
  or cherries may be added either to the pan or spread over the dough
  before rolling.

 Categories: Info/tips, Ceideburg 2

      1    Text Only
 
  I'm starting to post recipes from the excellent series of cookbooks
  put out by The Australian Women's Weekly. If you have any interest in
  these recipes at all, save this post. These are conversions from
  Ozzie to US and British measurements.
  
  QUICK CONVERSION GUIDE:
  
  Wherever you live in the world, you can use our recipes with the help
  of our easy-to-follow conversions for all your cooking needs. These
  conversions are approximate only.  The difference between the exact
  and approximate conversions of liquid and dry measures amounts to
  only a teaspoon or two, and will not make any noticeable difference
  to your cooking results.
  
  MEASURING EQUIPMENT:
  
  The difference between measuring cups internationally is minimal
  within 2 or 3 teaspoons difference.  (For the record, 1 Australian
  measuring cup will hold approximately 250ml.) The most accurate way
  of measuring dry ingredients is to weigh them.  When measuring
  liquids use a clear glass or plastic jug with metric markings.
  
  1 Teaspoon: 5ml 1 Tablespoon: 20ml
  
  NOTE:  NZ, CANADA, USA AND UK ALL USE 15ml TABLESPOONS. ALL CUP AND
  SPOON MEASUREMENTS ARE LEVEL.
  
  DRY MEASURES: Metric..Imperial 15 g......1/2oz 30 g......1oz 60
  g......2oz 90 g......3oz 125g.....4oz (1/4 1b) 155g.....5oz
  185g.....6oz 220g.....7oz 250 g.....8oz (1/2 lb) 280g.....9oz
  315g.....10oz 345g.....11oz 375 g.....12oz (3/4 lb) 410g.....13oz
  440g.....14oz 470g.....15oz 500 g.....16oz (1 lb) 750g.....24oz (1
  1/2 lb) 1kg......32oz (2 lb)
  
  LIQUID MEASURE: Metric............Imperial 30ml..............1 fluid
  oz 60ml..............2 fluid oz 100ml.............3 fluid oz
  125ml.............4 fluid oz 150ml.............5 fluid oz (1/4 pint/1
  gill) 190ml.............6 fluid oz 250ml.............8 fluid oz
  300ml.............10 fluid oz (1/2 pint) 500ml.............16 fluid oz
  600ml.............20 fluid oz (1 pint) 1000ml (1 litre)..1 3/4 pints
  
  WE USE LARGE EGGS WITH AN AVERAGE WEIGHT OF 60g.
  
  These equivalents are from various books in the Australian Women's
  Weekly series of cookbooks.

  When using the graduated metric measuring cups, it is important to
  shake the dry ingredients loosely into the required cup. Do not tap
  the cup on the bench, or pack the ingredients into the cup unless
  otherwise directed. Level top of cup with knife.  When using
  graduated metric measuring spoons, level top of spoon with knife.
  When measuring liquids in the jug, place jug on flat surface, check
  for accuracy at eye level.

      1 c  Whole-wheat flour
      3 ts Baking powder
      1 tb Honey
  1 1/2 c  Water; warm
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
 
  Recipe by: McDougall Preparation Time: 0:30 Mix dry ingredients
  together in a medium bowl. Add optional spices, if desired. Mix honey
  and warm water together, then add to dry ingredients, stirring just
  until mixed. Pour into lightly oiled or non-stick 8-inch square
  baking dish. Bake at 375 degrees for 20 minutes.
  
  HELPFUL HINTS: Various spices may be added for different flavors.
  Pieces of finely chopped or grated vegetables also may be added. Try
  finely chopped onion, finely chopped green pepper, chopped green
  chilis, chopped pimiento, grated carrots, grated zucchini. Used alone
  or in various combinations, they add special appeal to this simple,
  tasty corn bread. If you have a nonstick baking pan, it is not
  necessary to oil it first. This recipe also may be used for muffins.
  Increase baking powder to 4 teaspoons. Fill oiled or papered muffin
  tins two-thirds full. Bake at 375 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes. From

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        6    ripe Poblano chiles --
  :          roasted, peeled,
  :          slit and carefully deseeded
        2    duck breasts (i.e. breasts
  :          one duck) -- fat
  :          removed (and
  :          reserved)
        4 oz Monterey Jack cheese --
  :          grated
        1 md onion -- coarsely chopped
  :          fresh hot peppers to taste
  :          diced (I used about
  :          dozen Thais)
        4    cloves garlic -- crushed &
  :          minced
  :          finely
        2 lg springs of fresh rosemary --
  :          coarsely chopped
  :          salt and freshly ground
  :          black pepper.
  
  Melt a bit of duck fat in a very hot frying pan.  Salt and pepper the
  duck breasts, and fry them until cooked rare (approx 2 minutes per
  side). Remove the breasts and let cool. Now fry the onions until
  golden, adding a bit more duck fat if necessary.  While the onions
  are cooking, cut the duck breasts into small dice and put in a bowl.
  When the onions are almost done, add the garlic, rosemary and hot
  peppers, stir for about a minute, just enough to release the flavors.
  Scrape into bowl with the duck and stir until well mixed. Stuff the
  peppers with roughly 1/3 cheese, 2/3 duck mixture.  You can batter
  and fry them, but I baked these (10 minutes at 350 -- just enough to
  melt the cheese and heat them through) and sauced them with my basic
  ancho/cumin red sauce. Serves 2 as a main course, or 6 as an
  appetizer. [NB. These are even better if you have time to roast a
  duck instead of pan frying. Coat the duck with garlic & black bean
  paste, prick the skin thorouhly with a fork, and roast at 325 for 1
  1/2-2 hours, or until the fat has mostly cooked off. Let cool and
  shred the meat, including bits of skin. Then substitute for the diced
  cooked breast meat above.]

      Title: QUICK EGGPLANT
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Eggplant
        x  Garlic
        x  Fresh ground pepper
        x  Salt
        x  Olive oil (tiny bit)
        x  Cooked pasta
        x  Parmesan
 
  I use eggplant often, both peeled and unpeeled (in ratatoile). Quick
  recipe --
  
  bake (or roast) at 350 for one hour (poke holes first). Take out and
  let cool -- the eggplant(s) will deflate like a balloon and will smell
  heavenly! When slightly cool, peel and smush up with fork. Add garlic,
  fresh ground pepper and salt if you want. Reheat in just a tiny bit of
  olive oil (hope this is ok to say, this is my first post) in a
  non-stick skillet.  Serve over pasta with (again hope this is ok) a
  little grated parmesan.  This is a great easy afterwork recipe.

 Categories: Candies, Christmas
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Box confectioner's sugar
      6 tb Butter or margarine
    1/4 c  Milk
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/4    To 1/2 cup cocoa, depending
           -on how rich you want it
 
  My mom has been making fudge for years from a recipe she found on the
  side of a box of Domino's Powdered Sugar. The last time I found
  Domino's sugar, they weren't putting this recipe on the side of the
  box any more, so I'll go ahead and post it. Warning: it's fattening,
  very rich, but you can make it in less than a half hour and without
  all the beating and stirring that fudge normally takes.
  
  QUICK FUDGE
  
  Melt butter in bottom of large saucepan. Stir in confectioner's sugar,
  followed by all other ingredients. Keep stirring until mixture comes
  to a full boil. Pour mixture into an 8-inch square buttered pan. Let
  cool, cut into small squares.

 Categories: Korean, Vegetarian, Condiment
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Chinese turnip
  1 1/2 lb Chinese cabbage
      1 c  Water
    1/4 c  Salt
      4 lg Scallions
      4 lg Cloves Garlic or 6 sm clove
      2 tb Chopped fresh ginger
      7 ts Cayenne pepper
 
  1.  Wash the leaves of a Chinese cabbage and cut them into 2-inch
  lengths (the leafy end may be left longer; it will shrivel the most).
  Peel the Chinese turnip, halve it lengthwise down the center and then
  slice thin across the grain.
  
  2.  Combine the salt and water. Place the vegetables in a large pot.
  Pour the salted water over the surface of the vegetables and cover
  the pot. Leave overnight.
  
  3.  The next day, mince the scallions, garlic and ginger. Drain the
  vegetables, which should be wilted and reserve the salty water.
  Season with the cayenne, scallion, garlic and ginger. Mix the
  vegetables by hand, using rubber gloves if available. Pack this
  mixture tightly into jars. Pour the salted water over the mixture so
  that the liquid comes to within 1/2 inch of the top of the jar.
  
  4.  Keep at room temperature for 2 or 3 days, then refrigerate.
  
  Makes about 2 jars of kimchi which should be enough for a large dinner
  party.

      Title: QUICK MACADAMIA CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1    Garlic clove, pressed
      4    Chicken breasts, boned
    1/4 ts Dill
    1/2    Sweet red pepper
    1/4 lb Green beans (optional)
      1 lg Tomato
    1/8 lb Macadamia nuts
      4 tb Honey
    1/8 ts Sesame seeds
           Sesame oil
 
  Slice or chop all ingredients.  Saute the garlic in the sesame oil,
  until just fragrant. Add the dill and the chicken, and saute for
  about five minutes. Add the green beans and the red pepper; saute for
  another couple of minutes. Add the tomato and the macadamia nuts;
  saute another minute or two.  Add the honey and the sesame seeds.
  Continue cooking just long enough to warm the honey.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Quick and easy chicken with macadamia nuts and honey -- I devised
  this recipe last year.  We like it a lot, and it's very quick.
  
  *  This is wonderful served with couscous.  I recommend using chicken
  broth when cooking the couscous.
  
  *  If you want to take the time, you can thicken the sauce with about
  1/4 t arrowroot, or some cornstarch.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes.

      Title: QUICK MEAL--PASTA SUSANNA
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Cooked pasta (I like
           Rotini)
      1    Chopped vegetables (i.e.
           Mushrooms, Bell Peppers,
           Broccoli, Zucchini/Summer
           Squash)
      1    Spinach
      1    Onions
      1    Garlic
      1    Veggie broth
      1 cn Diced tomatoes and broth
 
  In large non-stick skillet, saute onions & mushrooms & garlic. After a
  while, add spinach if frozen.  Wait until spinach thaws, then add your
  other veggies.  You may want to add some veggie broth. Before they're
  quite done, add 1 can (more if you like tomatoes, or if you're
  feeding lots (3 or more) people) of diced tomatoes with their sauce.
  Stir until tomatoes start to warm up, then add the cooked pasta. Stir
  all together. Spice as desired. (Basil, oregano, and dill is good.)
  Don't forget freshly ground pepper.
  
  This is quick, although it does use two pans.  It really impressed my
  roommate the first time I made it. I like it because I can use lots of
  veggies, and it isn't terribly tomatoey. It's so much lighter than
  pouring regular tomato sauce on your pasta.
  
  Source: I must confess, I adapted this recipe from my aunt, who used
  olive *il and barely any veggies. That's why I call it Pasta Susanna
  instead of Pasta Donna.

 20 1/2 oz Box Brownie mix
    2/3 c  Chocolate chips or*

MMMMM---------------------------ICING--------------------------------
    1/2 c  Butter, room temperature
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Peppermint extract
      1 c  Confectioners sugar
 10 1/2 oz Chocolate fudge topping
 
  * chopped walnuts
  
   Brownies
  
   Brownies have been an American favorite for close to one hundred
  years. Time your brownies carefully so they do not come out too "wet"
  or "dry": test for doneness several times during baking.
  
   Your guests won't know you've used a packaged brownie mix for this
  one-and don't tell them.
  
   Prepare brownies as directed on package, stirring chocolate chips or
  walnut pieces into batter before baking. Let brownies cool, cut into 1
  1/2-inch squares and refrigerate for 2 hours.
  
   To prepare icing, cream together butter, salt, peppermint extract and
  confectioners sugar until smooth. Spread over brownies. Let icing set.
  
   Spread chocolate fudge topping over the top of each frosted brownie
  square. Place the brownies in the freezer for 5-10 minutes. Remove and
  serve or keep in a cool spot until serving.

 Categories: Pastry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 c  Flour, instant, or more
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 lb Butter, unsalted, cut into
           -- large chunks
    3/4 c  Water, cold (about)
 
  For Quick Puff Pastry: ======================
  
       In a mixing bowl or mixer, roughly combine the flour, salt and
  butter, breaking up the butter slightly (there should be visible
  chunks). Gradually add just enough cold water to hold the dough
  together. DO NOT OVERWORK.
  
       Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and roll it
  into a rectangular shape about 9 by 12 inches. Dust the board, dough,
  and rolling pin with flour as often as necessary to prevent sticking.
  Starting with the closest short end, fold the dough into thirds as
  you would a letter.  Rotate the dough so the open side is at your
  right. Repeat, rolling the dough into a rectangle, folding it into
  thirds and rotating is as before.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and
  chill for at least 1 hour.
  
       Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface with the open
  side at your right.  Roll the dough into a rectangle as before. Now
  bring the two short ends together to meet in the center of the dough,
  then fold the dough in half again toward you.  Rotate a 1/4 turn, so
  the open side is again at your right. Repeat, rolling the dough into
  a rectangle, folding in half, then in half again, and rotating a 1/4
  turn. Wrap the dough and chill again for at least 1 hour.

      Title: QUICK SODA CRACKERS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 80 Servings
 
      4 c  All-purpose flour
      4 ts Salt
      1 tb Baking powder
    1/4 c  Plus 2 Tablespoons
           Shortening
  1 1/2 c  Water
           Salt for the tops (opt.)
 
  "These crackers cannot truly duplicate the lightness of traditional
  soda crackers, but they take a fraction of the time to make, and they
  are delicious in their own right. Plain, slightly biscuity crackers,
  they go well with soups or stews. 350~ F 25 to 30 minutes Preheat the
  oven to 350~ F. In the food processor or a large bowl, combine the
  flour, salt, and baking powder. Cut the shortening into the flour
  until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the water, little by
  little, and blend to form a dough that will hold together in a
  cohesive ball. Divide the dough into 3 equal portions for rolling. On
  a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll out to a rectangle
  approximately 1/4 inch thick and position so the long edge runs
  horizontally in front of you. Fold the left third of the dough over
  the center third. Likewise, fold the right third over the center. The
  dough is now in 3 layers with the seam running vertically. Give the
  dough a quarter turn so the seam now runs horizontally. Roll out
  again to a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Fold and turn the dough
  again as in the first step. You are now ready for the final rolling.
  Roll the dough out somewhat thinner this time, about 1/8 inch thick.
  If desired, sprinkle the top lightly and evenly with salt and roll
  over it lightly with the rolling pin. With a sharp knife, cut into
  2-inch squares and place them on an ungreased baking sheet. Prick
  each square 2 or 3 times with the tines of a fork. Bake for 25 to 30
  minutes, or until lightly browned. Cool on a rack. Yield:  80-85.

           -JUDY LAUSCH DGSV34A
  4 1/2 c  Bread flour
      2 tb Wheat germ
      1 tb Sugar
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Ginger
      2 pk Fast-acting dry yeast
      1 c  Warm water; (120-130*)
      1 c  Sour cream; room temp.
      2 tb Vinegar
      1    Egg white
      1 tb Water
      2 ts Poppy seeds
 
  1. In large bowl, combine 1 1/2 c flour, and next five ingredients
  (wheat germ, sugar, salt, ginger and yeast); blend well. Add water,
  sour cream and vinegar to flour mixture. Blend at low speed until
  mositened; beat 3 minutes at medium speed. Stir in an additional 2 to
  2 1/2 c flour until dough pulls cleanly away from sides of bowl. 2.
  On floured surface, knead in remaining 1/2 to 1 c flour until dough
  is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Place dough in greased bowl;
  cover loosely with plastic wrap and cloth towel. Let rise in warm
  place until light and doubled in size, 25-35 minutes. 3. Grease large
  cookie sheet. Punch down dough several times to remove all air
  bubbles. Allow to rest on counter covered with inverted bowl for 15
  minutes. Divide dough in half; roll each half to 14x8" rectangle.
  Starting with longest side, roll up; pinch edges firmly to seal.
  Place seam side down on greased cookie sheet; taper ends to a point.
  With sharp knife, make five 1/4" deep diagonal slashes on top of each
  loaf. Cover; let rise in warm place until light and doubled in size,
  about 15 minutes. 4. Heat oven to 375*F. Bake 25 minutes. In small
  bowl, beat egg white and water. Remove bread from oven; brush with
  egg white mixture. Sprinkle with poppy seed. Return to oven. Bake an
  additional 5 to 10 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when lightly
  tapped. Immediately remove from cookie sheet; cool on wire racks.

      Title: QUICK SOURDOUGH STARTER
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Starter
 
      2 c  Flour
      1 tb Yeast (1 package)
  1 1/2 c  Water 105 - 115 deg. F.
 
  In a large bowl mix the yeast with the water and allow to proof for
  about 10 minutes. If the yeast doesn't start to puff up and bubble,
  discarded and start over with fresh yeast.
  
  Sprinkle the flour into the yeast mixture and beat into a thick
  batter. The batter doesn't have to be too smooth as the action of the
  yeast will break down any lumps. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and
  let stand in a warm (80-85 F or 25-30 C) place for about 24 hours, or
  until it is nice and frothy. You can use the starter right away or
  let it age for up to 3 days longer to develope a richer flavor. Store
  starter in fridge between uses and use or replenish every two weeks.
  
  You can use any flour or combination of flours to make the starter;
  some rye and buckwheat added to all-purpose makes a nice blend.
  
  To replenish the starter: mix equal parts of water and flour (about a
  cup of each is good) and add to the starter at least every two weeks.
  Let the starter age in a warm place for 6 to 24 hours, then use or
  return to the fridge.

      1 ts Oregano flakes
      1 cn Stewed tomatoes; 14 oz
    3/4 c  Water; or less
    1/2 ts Salt
     16 oz (canned) favorite chili
           -beans
           (pink, red, pinto,etc)
 
  This is a quick recipe that produces a slightly  hot, very aromatic
  chili. I liked it very much. Brown the turkey in a skillet. Transfer
  to a 3 quart pot. Brown the onion in the oil (yes, in the skillet).
  Transfer to the pot. Add all other ingredients except the beans to
  the pot and simmer, covered, for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally,
  adding a little more water if things dry out too much. Drain the
  beans (or not, as you choose) and add them to the pot. Simmer another
  10 minutes.

      Title: QUICK SWEET PICKLES
 Categories: Pickles, Canning
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
      8 lb Pickling cucumbers
           -- (3- to 4-inch)
    1/3 c  Canning or pickling salt
  4 1/2 c  Sugar
  3 1/2 c  Vinegar (5 percent)
      2 ts Celery seed
      1 tb Whole allspice
      2 tb Mustard seed
      1 c  Pickling lime (optional)*
 
  *(for use in variation below for making firmer pickles)
  
  May be canned as either strips or slices.
  
  Yield: About 7 to 9 pints
  
  Procedure: Wash cucumbers. Cut 1/16-inch off blossom end and discard,
  but leave 1/4 inch of stem attached. Slice or cut in strips, if
  desired. Place in bowl and sprinkle with 1/3 cup salt. Cover with 2
  inches of crushed or cubed ice. Refrigerate 3 to 4 hours. Add more
  ice as needed. Drain well.
  
  Combine sugar, vinegar, celery seed, allspice, and mustard seed in
  6-quart kettle. Heat to boiling.
  
  Hot pack--Add cucumbers and heat slowly until vinegar solution
  returns to boil. Stir occasionally to make sure mixture heats evenly.
  Fill sterile jars, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. For more information
  see "Jars and Lids".
  
  Raw pack--Fill jars, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Add hot pickling
  syrup, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Adjust lids and process according
  to the recommendations in Table 1 or use the low-temperature
  pasteurization treatment. For more information see "Low-Temperature
  Pasteurization Treatment".
  
  Variation for firmer pickles: Wash cucumbers. Cut 1/16-inch off
  blossom end and discard, but leave 1/4-inch of stem attached. Slice
  or strip cucumbers. Mix 1 cup pickling lime and 1/2 cup salt to 1
  gallon water in a 2- to 3-gallon crock or enamel-ware container.
  Caution: Avoid inhaling lime dust while mixing the lime-water
  solution. Soak cucumber slices or strips in lime water solution for
  12 to 24 hours, stirring occasionally. Remove from lime solution and
  rinse and resoak 1 hour in fresh cold water. Repeat the rinsing and
  resoaking two more times. Handle carefully because slices or strips
  will be brittle. Drain well.
  
  Storage: After processing and cooling, jars should be stored 4 to 5
  weeks to develop ideal flavor.
  
  Variation: Add 2 slices of raw whole onion to each jar before filling
  with cucumbers.
  
  Table 1. Recommended process time for Quick Sweet Pickles in a
  boiling-water canner.

                             To Chop Fennel Seeds
  
  Small hard seeds like fennel do not grind well. Here's how to chop
  them without scattering them all over the counter.
  
  Pour just enough water or oil on a small pile of seeds to moisten
  them. The seeds can then be chopped with a chef's knife without
  flying all over the kitchen.
  
                To Keep Cake Filling From Bleeding Into Frosting
  
  1. Fill a pastry bag with the outer frosting and fit it with a plain,
  round tip. Pipe a circle of frosting around the top edge of all the
  layers except the one that will form the top of the cake.
  
  2. Spread the filling inside this frosting ring. the frosting ring
  will seal the layers of the cake together and prevent the filling
  from seeping out.
  
                         To Clean a Food Processor Bowl
  
  The easiest way to clean bowls is to soak them, but the hole in the
  center of a food processor makes this impossible to do. Here's how.
  
  Remove the bowl cover and blade from the bowl. Set an empty 35mm film
  canister upside down over the hole in the food processor bowl. Now
  you can fill the bowl with warm, soapy water and allow it to soak.
  
                            To Make a Cookbook Holder
  
  1. Cut the hooks off of two wire coat hangers just below their twists.
  
  2. Use pliers to straighten the coat hanger wire. Then bend a hook
  into each end of each piece of  wire, making sure that the hooks bend
  in opposite directions on each piece of wire and that the bottom hook
  is longer than the top hook.
  
  3. Hang the wires by their top hooks over a cabinet door, spacing
  them to accommodate the size book or magazine you're using.
  
                             To Form Icebox Cookies
  
  1. Use scissors to cut down the length of a cardboard tube, such as
  the core of a roll of paper towels.
  
  2. Line the inside of the tube with waxed paper.
  
  3. Pack the cookie dough into the tube.
  
  4. When the tube is full, close it, wrap a rubber band around each
  end, and refrigerate it. After the dough is chilled, unwrap it and
  slice it for baking. The dough will be perfectly shaped.
  
                             To Skin Tomatoes Easily
  
  Cut the tomatoes in half, remove the seeds, and grate the tomatoes on
  the side of the grater with the largest holes. You will end up with
  grated pulp and no skin.
  
                        To Make Your Own Magi-Cake Strips
  
  Moistened magi-Cake Strips prevent cakes from peaking, cracking, and
  overbrowning. Here's how to make your own.
  
  1. Fold a sheet of newspaper to make a strip the width of the pan
  height.
  
  2. Wet the strip with water.
  
  3. Wrap the strip around the cake pan.
  
  4. Secure the strips with wet kitchen twine. Fill the cake pan with
  batter and bake.
  
                              To Grease Pans
  
  Purchase a bottle moistener with a sponge tip, fill it with oil, and
  use it grease baking pans. No more greasy paper towels or fingers.

 Categories: Japanese, Condiments, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     12 md Turnips
      5    Heaping Tbs salt
      4    (10-cm) piece giant kelp
           -(konbu)
      1    (2 1/2-cm) square yuzu
           -citron or lemon rind
 
  An example of "instant" salt pickling.  It takes only an hour for
  these pickles to ripen, and they will keep, covered, in the
  refrigerator for the better part of a week. Also appropriate for
  cucumber sliced in thin wafers. Peel and seed large cucumbers.
  
  To prepare:  Cut off greens from turnips and reserve. Wash turnips,
  peel, then cut into very fine julienne strips. Wash greens, dry, then
  chop finely.
  
  Put turnip strips with finely chopped greens into a bowl and sprinkle
  with salt.  Table salt is fine. Knead with your hands and mix
  thoroughly to draw water out of vegetable. In less than a minute, a
  fair amount of liquid will be produced.  Discard this liquid.
  
  Add the konbu and a 1-inch (2 1/2-cm) square of yuzu citron or lemon
  rind. Let stand, lidded and with a light weight, for 1 hour at room
  temperature.
  
  To serve:  Pick out a portion from the bowl with chopsticks or fork
  and shake off liquid.  Arrange in a mound on individual pickle dish.
  You may season with a few drops of soy sauce, if desired.

  NOTE:  The "lidded and with a light weight" refers to making them in a
  Japanese pickle tub.  A plate with a small rock in a nonreactive pan
  will do.

 Categories: Digest, Nov.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  TVP
    1/2 c  Water
      1 md Onion, chopped fine
      1    Or 2 cloves garlic, minced
        x  Water or other liquid for
           Sauteing
        x  Your favorite barbeque
           Sauce
 
  Mix the TVP with the 1/2 cup water and set aside for 5 minutes.
  
  Saute onion in about 1 Tbs. liquid until almost cleear. Then add
  garlic and cook for another minute. Add the reconstituted TVP. Add
  the barbeque sauce until the mixture is the right consistency for
  sandwiches. Heat thoroughly and serve.
  
  It's so easy!  And if you want to avoid commercial barbeque sauce and
  make your own, I'm sure there are a lot of good recipes for homemade
  bbq sauce out there. (Post 'em!) Something strange (to me at least)
  that is available here in South Carolina is a mustard-based sauce;
  I'd never seen it before I moved here, but now that I've discovered
  it, I'm addicted! It works great in this recipe.  If anyone out there
  has a recipe for mustard-based barbeque sauce, I'd love the recipe.

      Title: QUICK VEGETABLE JUMBLE
 Categories: Digest, Jan.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    10-oz brick frozen spinach,
           Thawed and somewhat
           Drained
      2    15-oz cans corn, somewhat
           Drained
      1    15-oz can Italian white
           Kidney beans (or substitute
           Great Northerns)

MMMMM---------------------SEASONING OPTION 1--------------------------
      3 ts Canned chopped garlic
           (Polaner brand is packed in
           Water)
           (or 1*tsp garlic powder)
      1 ts Black pepper
      2 ts Dehydrated onion flakes

MMMMM---------------------SEASONING OPTION 2--------------------------
    1/2 ts Paprika
      2 ts Italian seasoning

MMMMM---------------------SEASONING OPTION 3--------------------------
    1/4 c  Bottled Italian or
           Vinaigrette dressing
           (and drain the corn more
           Thoroughly)
 
  Rip up the spinach a bit, if it's in huge stringy clumps. Toss
  everything together in a bowl.  Let sit for a few minutes if you've
  got dry spices in there. Heat up if you feel like it, else eat cold.
  
  I'd like to try this with chopped red bell pepper in it - I think it
  would taste good, and I know it would look good...
  
  It would also taste good with kidney or black beans, but the darker
  liquid from the beans would make the dish look muddy. Most of my
  veggie cooking looks brown (or red) and boring - it's a nice change
  to eat something bright and pretty...
  
  Actually, I usually make this with frozen corn...  but I don't measure
  that, I just pour it from the bag...

      Title: QUICK-N-DIRTY VEGETABLE SAUCE
 Categories: Digest, August
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
        x  Garlic
        x  Pam
        x  Sun-dried tomatoes (opt)
        x  Vegetables
        x  Fresh basil
        x  Canned tomato sauce
        x  Tomato paste
        x  Herbs
 
  Grate copious amounts of garlic and saute in a squirt of Pam spray
  until brown.  Sprinkle in some rosemary and oregano. Add veggies and
  some water and saute. Add some fresh basil leaves if you have them,
  and saute until they just wilt. Add a sufficient amount of canned
  tomato sauce and a little tomato paste to achieve the texture you
  want. For a couple of zucchini and 12 oz. of mushrooms, one standard
  can (16 oz?) of sauce is enough.
  
  Good veggies for this: mushroom, zucchini, broccoli, spinach,
  artichoke heart, green bean, acorn squash. Peppers and onions added
  to the saute overwhelm the whole dish for me, making it taste like a
  big pepper (rather than a big TOMATO which is what I want it to taste
  like).
  
  The Saturday afternoon way to get good veggies in sauce (a saute pan,
  a pot, a blender, another pot for skinning tomatoes):
  
  if I have time I start my tomato sauce by simmering 3 oz. of sundried
  tomatoes and a head or two of whole garlic cloves (uncut garlic,
  cooked before processing, has a much milder taste than garlic that is
  cut before cooking).  A handful of dried sweet red pepper flakes
  added to this is also good.  Once everthing is cooked/rehydrated, I
  puree it, return it to the pot, add sauteed veggies PLUS several
  large peeled/seeded/chopped tomatoes. Also rosemary, basil, oregano,
  thyme, bay leaves, etc. in random quantities, usually a couple of bay
  leaves and a couple of teaspoons of each of the dried herbs, and a
  big wad of fresh basil leaves (ADM hydroponic basil, found year-round
  in central IL grocery stores). Simmer this until it tastes done. If
  it's thin, add a little more water and it's soup, if thick, add a
  little tomato paste and it's spaghetti sauce. I've also put lentils
  in this and called it minestrone.

      Title: QUICKY CRUMBLE
 Categories: Breakfast, Cereals, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Serving
 
           Whole wheat Shreddies
      3 tb Butter or margarine
      1    Grannysmith or Macintosh
           -apple, cored
      1 tb Brown sugar
      1 ts Cinnamon
 
  Measure as much cereal as you want in your bowl (I use about 2 cups).
  Crush to fine crumbs in blender, or place in a plastic bag, hold it
  shut, and crush with the heel of your hand. Pour into medium mixing
  bowl. In a one-cup measure, microwave the butter on 100% power until
  melted; work butter into crumbs until mixture is moist and crumbly.
  Slice apple into thin, even slices, then place in microwave-safe,
  shallow baking dish. Spread cereal mixture evenly over apple slices.
  Microwave on 50% power 3 min, or until heated through and apple is
  tender. Sprinkle with cinnamon and brown sugar; microwave on 50%
  power 2 min longer. Serve hot with a little milk, a pat of butter or
  jam, or some fresh fruit.
  
  Variations: I have enjoyed this dish with banana slices in place of
  the apple. Also, substitute 1 tb your favorite jam for 1 tb of the
  butter. Stir the jam into the butter in the cup immediately after
  butter is melted. Try using an uncooked hot cereal, such as Cream of
  Wheat or Quaker Oat bran in place of the Shreddies, for a deliciously
  different porridge. Serve with whipped cream, ice cream or yogurt for
  dessert.

 Categories: Fruits/nuts, Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      6 md Quince
      6 c  Water
      2 c  Sugar
     12    Cloves
     18    Whole allspice berries
      1 lg Orange peel strip

      1    Cinnamon stick (3" long)
           Cranberry juice (optional)
           Balsamic vinegar, to taste
 
  CUT EACH QUINCE INTO QUARTERS, then cut quarters into pieces about
  1/2-inch thick. Grasp each piece firmly and cut away peel and core
  with sharp knife. When all slices have been cored and peeled, cut
  each piece into small chunks. Don't worry about the fruit
  discoloring. In saucepan, combine water, sugar, spices and orange
  peel. Bring mixture to boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Add quince.
  Reduce heat, cover pan and cook very slowly until fruit has turned a
  deep pink color, about 2 hours. You don't need to worry about
  overcooking as the fruit will hold its texture well. If cooked
  slowly, there should still be quite a bit of liquid in pan when fruit
  is done. Sort through cranberries, remove those that are not in good
  shape and rinse the rest. Add cranberries to cooked quince. If
  mixture seems too dry, add a little more water or cranberry juice.
  Increase heat a little and cook cranberries until they begin to pop
  open, 12-to-15 minutes. Use rubber scraper to gently mix them with
  quince. When done, refrigerate compote to cool, then stir in enough
  vinegar to balance the sweetness.

      Title: QUINOA INFORMATION
 Categories: Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  Quinoa: Native to the Andes and about the size of sesame seeds, quinoa
  (pronounced KEEN-wa) has a more impressive protein profile than that
  of wheat and contains numerous amino acids (lysine, cystine, and
  methionine) not normally found in grains.  It's also very
  quick-cooking, delicious, and easy to digest.
  
  Quinoa must be carefully swooshed in water and rinsed multiple times
  until the water runs clear to remove all the bitter saponin coating
  (believe to be a natural insect repellent). Packaged quinoa tends to
  be cleaner than quinoa bought in bulk.  Rinse the quinoa just before
  cooking and drain it thoroughly. If the grain sits for 5 to 10
  minutes in a moistened condition, the seeds begin to soften and this
  throws off the cooking time.
  
  Plain-cooked quinoa has a slightly grassy taste, so I prefer to cook
  it in vegetable stock with a few cloves of garlic or perhaps a
  generous pinch of dried herbs. I have experimented with toasting the
  quinoa before cooking, but I don't think it's worth the effort: The
  grain has a lovely nutty quality and slight crunch without any extra
  fussing.
  
  The trick to preparing quinoa is to be stingy on the water and the
  cooking time:  It can turn to mush in a flash. Be on guard! Properly
  cooked, it will be light, fluffy, and transparent, with a small white
  filament (the sprout) dangling visibly.  At the end of cooking time,
  if there's unabsorbed liquid in the pot and the quinoa is tender,
  simply pass it through the stainer.
  
  Quinoa's mild flavor makes it a very versatile grain. Substitute it
  for bulgar for a sensational Tabbouleh, or dye it scarlet with some
  raw beets and serve it warm or at room temperature. It's also a
  natural cooked with corn, another native American.  For a special
  treat, mail-order Ernie New's organic black quinoa; it's gorgeous to
  look at, and has a delightful nutty taste.  Warning: Ernie's black
  quinoa needs lots of rinsing and a minute or two more of cooking.

      Title: QUINOA LOAF
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Quinoa
      1 c  -Water
   3/16 ts Sea salt
    2/3 tb Olive oil
    2/3 c  Finely diced celery
   3/16 c  Finely diced fennel
    1/3 c  Finely diced onions
  1 1/3 ts Minced garlic
   3/16 c  Finely diced red bell pepper
    1/3 ts Sea salt
    2/3 tb Sesame seeds
    1/2 c  Cooked pinto beans
  1 1/3 tb Tahini
  1 1/3 tb Whole wheat flour
           -(stone-ground)
  1 1/3 tb Gluten flour
 
  Place the quinoa in a medium saucepan along with the water and 1/2
  teaspoon salt.  Bring to a simmer and cook, covered, until all the
  water has evaporated (about 15 minutes). Set aside.
  
  Heat the oil in a medium saucepan.  Saute the celery, fennel, onions,
  garlic, and bell pepper, along with the salt, marjoram, and cardamom,
  for about 5 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent burning. Add the
  cooked quinoa and the sesame seeds, pinto beans, and tahini to the
  sauteed vegetables.  Blend the ingredients.
  
  Mix the two flours together and blend into the vegetable and quinoa
  mixture. Line a large loaf pan with a baking sheet liner and lightly
  oil the liner. (In lieu of the baking sheet liner, you could just oil
  and flour the pan.)  Press the mixture into the pan. Bake at 400
  degrees F for about 45 minutes.  (The loaf should reach an internal
  temperature of 180-200 degrees F.)  Let the loaf cool, inverted, for
  10 minutes before removing it from the pan.  Serve the loaf in
  slices, with your favorite tomato (or other) sauce if desired.

 Categories: Rice, Spices, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Water
    1/2 c  Quinoa
      3 md Ripe tomatoes
      1 c  Parsley
      1 c  Scallions
    1/3 c  Freshly squeezed lemon juice
    1/3 c  Safflower oil
      2 tb Fresh mint
           Salt; to taste
 
  Note:  The author says that 1 tsp. dried mint could be used, but
  dried mint is nasty stuff, IMHO!
  
  Pour water into a 1-quart saucepan.  Add quinoa; bring to a boil.
  Reduce heat to a simmer; cover.  Cook for 10 to 15 min., or until all
  water has been absorbed.
  
  While the quinoa is cooking, finely chop the tomatoes, parsley, and
  scallions.  Add lemon juice, oil, and mint to tomato mixture. Stir in
  cooked quinoa and salt. Mix well.
  
  Let tabouli sit in the refrigerator for a day to blend flavors.
  
  Note:  Also, she neglected to mention that tabouli is traditionally
  served at room temperature.
  
  The recipe was from Linda Najjar of Seattle, Washington, and the "Herb
  Companion" note on it said: "Substituting quinoa for the traditional
  bulgur wheat gives this tabouli a lighter, fluffier, and slightly
  nutty taste and enables people allergic to wheat to experience the
  flavorful joys of this Middle Eastern dish."

 Categories: Vegetarian, Digest
      Yield: 1 Servings

  2 2/3 c  Vegetable stock (or water)
      4 sm Leeks
    1/2 c  Canned tomatoes (or 2 roma
           -size tomatoes)
      5 tb (rounded 1/4 cup) currants
      1 tb Ground cumin
      1 ts Cinnamon
      1 ts Garlic powder
    1/2 ts Turmeric
 
  Slice leeks in half length-wise.  Wash all of the larger leaves very
  well (leeks are very dirty.  If you don't wash it well enough your
  final dish will be gritty). Chop washed leeks cross-wise into thin
  slices.
  
  Place quinoa in a fine-meshed colander and rinse well for several
  minutes. You want to remove the bitter coating of saponin that quinoa
  sometimes has. You can also do this in a regular bowl if you are
  careful (fill with water, swirl qunioa around, pour out water, repeat
  until water is clear).
  
  Place leeks in nonstick pan and cook until limp and reduced (no need
  to add liquid, leeks will have some water from being washed and tend
  to give up liquid as they cook).
  
  Add spices to the leeks and stir until well mixed.
  
  Add quinoa and cook for a couple minutes.
  
  Add stock[, currants,] and tomatoes, bring to a boil, lower heat and
  simmer, covered, for 15-20 minutes until done.

 Categories: Lamb, Indian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
 
        5 lb leg of lamb
        3    cloves garlic -- mashed,
  :          AND
        1    piece fresh ginger, size of
  :          walnut -- minced
        1 ts salt
        1 ts turmeric
      1/2 ts ground cinnamon
      1/2 ts ground cardamom
      1/2 ts cayenne
      1/4 ts ground cloves
      1/2 ts saffron threads
      3/4 c  yoghurt
        2 TB blanched almonds
        2 TB blanched pistachios
        1 TB honey
  
  1.  Trim all fat from lamb, and, using a sharp knife, make slits all
  over the leg. 2. Combine the garlic/ginger paste and the salt with
  the cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, cardamom, cayenne, cloves, and lemon
  juice to make a paste.  If paste seems too thick, add more lemon
  juice. Spread the paste over the meat, forcing into each slit. 3.
  Soak the saffron threads in hot water for five minutes. 4. In a
  blender or food processor put the yoghurt, the blanched nuts and the
  saffron threads with their water, and puree. Coat the lamb with the
  puree. Drizzle honey over the meat. 5. It is best to marinate the
  meat for two days in the refrigerator, or at least overnight. Cover
  loosely. 6. Preheat oven to 450 F and roast lamb in a covered baking
  dish (use foil wrap if necessary) for 1/2 hour. Reduce heat to 325 F
  and cook at 25 minutes to the pound, about 1-1/2hours, until meat is
  tender.

      Title: RAAN MASALEDAR - WHOLE LEG OF LAMB IN A SPICY
 Categories: Meats, Main dish, Indian, Lamb
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      5 lb Lamb, leg of

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      2 oz Almonds, blanched
    1/2 lb Onions, coarsely chopped
      8    Garlic cloves, peeled
      4    Cubes ginger, 1", peeled
           ;chopped coarsely
      4    Green chillies, chopped
     20 fl Yoghurt, plain
      2 tb Cumin seed, ground
      4 ts Coriander seed, ground
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
  3 1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Garam masala
      6 tb Vegetable oil
    1/2 ts Whole cloves
     16    Cardamom pods
      1    Cinnamon stick, 2" long
     10    Peppercorns, black

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
      4 tb Sultana raisins
    1/2 oz Almonds, blanched, slivered
 
  Make sure that all the fat has been trimmed from the outside of the
  leg and that most of the fell (parchment-like white skin) has been
  pulled off. Put the leg in a baking dish made, preferably, of pyrex
  or stainless steel. Put the 2 oz. almonds, onions, garlic, ginger,
  green chillies, and 3 tablespoons of the yoghurt into the container
  of a food processor or blender and blend until you have a paste. Put
  the remaining yoghurt into a bowl. Beat lightly with a fork or a
  whisk until it is smooth and creamy. Add the paste from the
  processor, the cumin, coriander, cayenne, salt and garam masala. Mix.
  Push some of the spice paste into all the openings in the lamb. Be
  quite generous. (I forgot to say, you need to ask the butcher to make
  a deep pocket to hold a "stuffing", in this case, some spice paste
  mixture, or make a pocket yourself) Spread the paste evenly on the
  underside of the leg (the side that originally had less fat.) Now,
  using a small, sharp, pointed knife make deep slashes in the meat,
  and push in the spice paste with your fingers. Turn the leg over so
  its outer side (the side that was once covered with fat) is on the
  top. Spread a very thick layer of paste over it. Again, make deep
  slashes with the knife and push the spice paste into the slashes.
  Pour all the remaining spice paste over and around the meat. Cover
  with plastic cling film and refrigerate for 24 hours. Take the baking
  dish with the meat out of the refrigerator and let the meat come to
  room temperature. Remove the cling film. Heat the oil in a small
  frying pan over a medium flame. When hot, put in the cloves,
  cardamom, cinnamon and peppercorns. When the cloves swell - this
  takes just a few seconds - pour the hot oil and spices over the leg
  of lamb. (My note: I found the spices jumped and spat in the oil
  quite a lot - make sure your arms and counter are well protected)
  Preheat the oven gas mark 6, 400 F. Cover the baking dish tightly
  either with its own lid or with a large piece of aluminium foil.
  Bake, covered, for 1 hour 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake
  uncovered for 45 minutes. Baste 3-4 times with the sauce during this
  period. Scatter, or arrange in a pattern, the sultanas and the 1/2
  oz. almonds over the top of the leg and bake for another 5-6 minutes.
  Remove the baking dish from the oven and let it sit in a warm place
  for 15 minutes. Take the leg out of the pan and set it on a warm
  platter. Spoon off all the fat from the top of the sauce. Use a
  slotted spoon and fish out all the whole spice in the sauce. Discard
  the spices. Pour the sauce around the leg. My Notes: I served the
  sauce separately, in a gravy boat. It is delicious!

      Title: RABBIT A LA DANIELLE
 Categories: French, Main dish, Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 ea Large domestic rabbit
      1 x  Salt
      3 ea 1/2 pints of whipping cream
      1 x  Pepper
 
  Bake in an open casserole at 325F. for two to three hours. The oval
  French glazed earthenware casserole dishes are the best. A large New
  Zealand Red rabbit or one that size is the best. This will fill a
  large casserole dish. The French remove the eyes, but leave the head
  attached. Sounds gross to American tastes, but the head has some of
  the tenderest meat on the rabbit and surprisingly a large amount.
  French children (mine as well) fight over who gets the head. Serve
  with roasted carrots and potatoes. Danielle says that since she is
  not a good cook and hates to cook, this dish is easy to prepare and
  serve. It still has that marvelous French flair that is incomparable.
  Oh yes, serve also with crusty baguettes of French bread and a very
  dry Chardonnay.  Come to think of it, a good dry Cabernet Sauvignon
  or Pinot Noir wouldn't be bad either.

  Skin, clean, cut into pieces and dredge the rabbit[s] in flour. In a
  skillet render the salt pork and saute the shallots and mushrooms 5
  min. If you don't have shallots, substitute mild onion plus a small
  clove of garlic. Remove and reserve the mushroom mixture. Saute the
  rabbit pieces until browned. Add the stock, wine and spice bag and
  simmer until tender, about 2 hours. Remove the spice bag and add the
  mushroom mixture 10 minutes before serving. Just before serving stir
  in a jigger of brandy and a swirl of butter. The gravy can optionally
  be thickened with a slurry of flour and water. Or the flour and
  butter can be made into a roux and added.

      Title: RACK OF LAMB DIJON
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1    Rack of lamb; medium
           Dijon mustard
           Italian bread crumbs
 
  Have the butcher take off the chine bone--or at the very least score
  it through so that the chops can be cut. The ends of the chops should
  be 'Frenched"...so you can see the bone. Put dijon all over the
  lamb...coat it well.  Pat the bread cumbs on top of the mustard, so
  that they adhere. particularly important on the rounded side...the
  top. Place lamb in a pre-heated over...450 degrees.  Roast for about
  35 minutes. This will give you a RARE lamb rack...the only way as far
  as I am concerned. Rest for 10 minutes and serve. Will serve two, or
  one very hungry person. Recipe was adapted from FINALLY   MICHAEL'S

      Title: RACLETTE
 Categories: Appetizers, Swiss
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Raclette cheese
           Roasted potatoes
           Bread
 
  Raclette cheese is also called Bagnes, Gomser, Valais Raclette, and
  Fromage a Raclette. There are a number of Raclette-type cheeses in
  Switzerland; among these are Belsano and Belalp. Gruyere is somewhat
  similar.
  
  Raclette is made in Switzerland, primarily in the canton of Valais;
  most is made on farms of unpasteurized whole cow's milk. The cheese
  is in the Swiss flavor family. It tastes mild and delicious when
  served at room temperature; soft and nutty; heating unlocks extra
  flavors and aroma. Texture is very firm. The cheese resembles
  Gruyere, with a slightly rough, light-brown rind and a
  pale-ivory-yellow to light-brown interior with more holes than
  Gruyere.
  
  Swiss cheese are quite reliable; federal inspectors grade the cheeses
  according to strict standards. Swiss law prohibits the use of
  artificial additives, coloring agents, and milk from cows fed on
  silage. The rind should be even and have no cracks. The cheese should
  not be sharp. The text should not be grainy. Best is between four and
  six months old; if uncut, will continue to age. If cut, keeps about
  one month if well-wrapped.
  
  To prepare Raclette: A thick slice is cut across the surface of the
  whole cheese and toasted until runny and bubbling. It is usually
  eaten with a roasted potato. Another method is to put the slice of
  cheese in front of a fire and then scrape it onto bread.
  
  Also served unheated as a table cheese at the end of meals.
  
  Good with light German beer and white Swiss wines, such as Fendant.

      Title: RACLETTE (SWISS MELTED CHEESE WITH POTATOES &
 Categories: Appetizers, Swiss
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Swiss raclette cheese
      4 sm New potatoes
      4 sm Sour gherkins; up to 8
      4    Pickled onions; up to 8
 
  Cut cheese into 16 slices, each approximately 1/8 inch thick, 5
  inches long and 2 inches wide. Boil potatoes just before use, peel
  and keep hot.
  
  Preheat the oven to 500'F for at least 15 minutes. Heat four 10-inch
  ovenproof dinner plates in the oven for 3 to 5 minutes. To ensure the
  success of the raclette, the plates must be very hot.
  
  When redy to serve, remove the plates from the oven, grasping them
  with potholders, and, as quickly as you can, arrange four slices of
  the cheese in the center of each plate, overlapping them slightly.
  The cheese should begin to sizzle as soon as it comes in contact with
  the plate. At once, place the four plates on the floor of the oven
  (if you are using an electric oven, place the plates on a rack set in
  the first slot above the source of heat). In about 2 minutes (5 to 6
  minutes in an electric oven) the cheese should melt to a creamy,
  bubbly mass; do not let it turn the slightest bit brown. Remove from
  the oven, place a potato and one or two gherkins and pickled onions
  on the side of each plate and serve at once, setting each plate on a
  service plate to prevent it from scorching the table.
  
  NOTE: Swiss diners often consume at least 2 to 3 plates of raclette in
  succession at one sitting. Should you want to do the same, double or
  triple all the ingredients and have two or three sets of dinner
  plates heating in the oven while the first batch of raclette is being
  eaten.

  sauce, and hot pepper sauce; beat with an electric mixer on low
  speed, or cover and process till well combined. (Mixture will be
  crumbly). Form into a ball. Shape into a 4-1/2 inch round about 1
  inch high. Wrap in clear plastic wrap; chill several hours or
  overnight.
  
  Unwrap cheese round; place in a 6 inch cast-iron skillet or heavy
  pan. Cut into 6 wedges; separate wedges slightly. Place skillet or
  pan on the rack of a smoker or grill over slow coals. Cover and smoke
  for 5 to 7 minutes or til softened and heated through, checking often
  to make sure the cheese doesn't overmelt. (The cheese shouldn't loose
  it's shape or start to run.) Top each wedge with a pimiento slice and
  herb sprig, if desired. Serve with warm vegetables and bread. Makes 6
  appetizers.
  
  *It is important to use process cheese.  Process cheese melts
  smoothly, giving an acceptable texture.
  
  **If you like, blanch or boil the vegetables ahead of time, cover and
  chill.  Wrap in foil and reheat on grill while the cheese smokes.

      Title: RAFIOLA KOKOKARION (COCONUT PASTRIES W/ GLACE
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      3    Potatoes
      3 tb Granulated sugar
      1 pn Salt
      2    Egg yolks
      4 c  Finely shredded coconut
  1 1/2 c  Glaceed fruit
           Confectioners' sugar
 
  (Author's note): In a Cretan zacharoplasteion (sweet shop), we were so
  intrigued by these coconut pastries (among the newer breed) that I
  tried them at home. You can expect the potato pastry to be a bit
  difficult to manipulate, and you can also anticipate compliments on
  the results. Attractive and tasty, not excessively sweet.
  
  Boil the potatoes in their jackets until fork tender, then drain and
  remove the skins and all spots. Return the potatoes to the pan and
  dry over medium heat, shaking pan constantly. Push the potatoes
  through a mill or ricer, then combine in a large bowl with the sugar
  and salt. When somewhat cool, add the egg yolks and coconut and knead
  until smooth. Refrigerate for 2 hours.
  
  Remove the dough from the refrigerator and knead until smooth enough
  to roll. If sticky, dust lightly with flour. Roll out on a floured
  board to 1/4-inch thickness, then, using a glass with a 3-1/2-inch
  diameter, cut the pastry into rounds.
  
  Meanwhile, mince the glaceed fruit. Place 1 tablespoon on the center
  of each of the pastry rounds. Lift one side with a spatula and fold
  over the other half, forming a half-circle. Press the edges together
  and place on a baking sheet. Continue until all have been stuffed,
  then bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 15 minutes, or until firm;
  the pastries will be white. Remove and cool for 10 minutes, then roll
  in confectioners' sugar and cool completely. Store in a covered
  container.
  
  Note: In Crete this pastry is cut with a serrated pastry cutter
  producing an attractive edging.

   Cream together the butter and sugar, slowly add egg yolks, nutmeg and
  lemon rind.  Stir this mixture into sifted flour and fold in the
  stiffly beaten egg whites. The dough will be soft but manageable. If
  too soft, cover the bowl and chill for several hours. Roll out small
  amounts of the dough at a time on a floured board, keeping the rest
  chilled until ready to use. Roll dough about 1/4 inch thick and cut
  into strips 1 X 6". Fold the strips in half and twist them several
  times, twisting them together.
   Fry until golden brown in oil heated to 375 degrees F. When done,
  remove from oil and drain on paper towels. Dust generously with
  sifted powdered sugar. Keep fresh in a covered tin. Make 7 dozen.

      Title: RAGU ALLA BOLOGNESE
 Categories: Sauces, Pasta, Italian
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
    1/2 oz Dried porcini mushrooms
    1/2 lb Lean veal shoulder
    1/2 lb Lean beef round or shin
  2 1/2 oz Pancetta or blanched bacon
      4 oz Large yellow onion
      1 lg Carrot
      1 lg Celery stalk
      5 tb Butter
      3 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Salt
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 c  Dry red wine
  2 1/2 c  Drained canned plum tomatoes
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
           Freshly grated parmigiano
           Freshly ground pepper
 
  This takes a fair amount of time to make, but it freezes very well,
  so make a large batch. This is enough for 2 1/2-to-3 pounds of pasta.
  PUT THE PORCINI in a small bowl. Pour boiling water over them and let
  them sit for 30 minutes. Drain them, rinse carefully, chop coarsely
  and rinse carefully again. With a food processor or meat grinder,
  finely chop first the veal and beef, then the pancetta, onion, carrot
  and celery. Saute the pancetta and minced vegetables in the butter
  and oil in a heavy-bottomed casserole for 2 minutes over medium heat.
  Turn heat to very low, cover and continue cooking 30 minutes,
  stirring occasionally. Uncover the pot and raise heat to medium high.
  Add the beef, veal, mushrooms, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring
  constantly, until the meats just begin to lose their raw red color.
  Then pour on the wine and cook until it is entirely evaporated. Set a
  food mill with the medium blade over the pot and mill in the
  tomatoes. Stir everything together and simmer, covered for 40
  minutes. If possible, complete preparation to this point several
  hours in advance, or even the night before you plan to use the sauce.
  Take it off the stove and let it cool if not serving immediately.
  Transfer to container. Cover and refrigerate. The sauce may also be
  made to this point and frozen. Shortly before serving time, bring the
  sauce slowly to a simmer. Simmer 5 minutes. Stir in the heavy cream
  and serve immediately over freshly cooked pasta, passing parmigiano
  and a pepper mill. To serve ragu in smaller quantities, heat about
  1/2 cup of sauce per person and stir in 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons cream
  per serving.

           Peppercorns
      2 tb Coarsely Chopped Fresh
           Cilantro Roots Or Leaves
           And Stems
      2 tb Coarsely Chopped Garlic
 
  CILANTRO PESTO:  Using a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder, crush
  or grind the peppercorns to a fine powder. Combine the pepper,
  cilantro roots and garlic; work the three ingredients into a fairly
  smooth paste in the mortar or in a small blender or food processor.
  If you use a blender or food processor, you may need to add a little
  vegetable oil or water to ease the grinding. Make about 1/4 cup. For
  an industrial strength batch use 1 tb peppercorns, 1/2 cup cilantro
  roots and 1/2 cup garlic. To store the pesto for later use, put in a
  glass jar, pour a little oil onto the surface to cover it and seal
  tightly. It will keep nicely for about 1 week in the refrigerator.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 tb Corn meal
    1/2 pt Water
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 qt Milk
      1 ts Salt
      8 c  Flour (variable)
 
  "Salt rising bread is leavened by the fermentation of flour and milk.
  Bacteria are most important actors in this play. The yeast plants of
  the air find the batter a good stage for development. Salt rising
  bread needs more heat while fermenting and a much longer time to
  bake. Here is a good example:"
  
  Stir 2 Tbsp. of corn meal into 1/2 pint of water heated to 130 F. Add
  1/2 tsp. of salt and mix very well. Put this in a jar or crock, cover
  and place it in a pan of water at 160 F. Keep overnight in a warm
  place.
  
  In the morning, warm 1 quart of milk; add 1 tsp. salt and enough warm
  flour to make a heavy batter. Gradually add the overnight corn meal
  and beat well for a few moments.  Cover and keep in a warm place

 Categories: Chinese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------RAINBOW JELLY FISH--------------------------
    150 g  Dried jelly fish
      1    Red pepper
    1/4    Yam bean (optional), or
           -turnip
    2/3    Cucumber
    2/3    Celery stalk
    1/3    Carrot
      1 tb Sesame seeds
  1 1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar
      2 ts Sesame oil
 
  The following 12 recipes are from a booklet put out by the Hong Kong
  Tourist Association in celebration of the 1986 Hong Kong Food
  Festival. These are the winning chefs and their winning recipes. The
  chefs are all ethnic Chinese from all over Asia, but the recipes
  really run the gamut, from traditional Chinese food to dishes like
  Shark's Fin Soup to things like "Lamb Fillets with Morels" which is
  Western in inspiration and presentation.
  
  Some of the recipes should have the caveat "Don't try this at home,
  kids", mainly because of the amount of preparation involved. This
  first one, an appetizer plate consisting of 7 mini-courses, falls
  into that category. It's presented in one of those round, segmented
  lazy-susan type serving things.  Very striking. Any one of these
  dishes would be suitable for a main course in a Chinese meal.
  
  Chef: Ng Wang-chau
  
  Twenty-eight old, Hong Kong-born Mr.  Ng has worked in three of Hong
  Kong's leading Sichuanese restaurants since he began his career 14
  years ago. Apart from creating this Award-winner, he is also renowned
  for his pan-fried spiny lobster.
  
  Establishment:  Ziyang Szechuen Restaurant G/F., 45D Chatham Road
  South, Tsimshatsui, Kowloon.
  
  Chinese Cuisine Practical Class Platinum Award - Appetizer [Chinese
  characters for dish name deleted. S.C.] Circle Game (12 servings)
  Chef.- Ng Wang-chau (Ziyang Szechuen Restaurant)
  
  The literal translation, "Turning Around Life", prompts a host
  meaningful connotations for this Sichuanese starter. Seven
  mini-courses, composed of contrasting flavours, represent the varying
  moods, as well as the seven stages, of a person's life.  An
  alternative translation - "Life is a Merry-go round" - captures the
  spirit of the theme, and its presentation, so appropriately on a
  turntable.  Each of the individual dishes, which could be served
  separately or a few at a time, also have their own particular
  mythological and dietary connotations.
  
  1.  Soak jelly fish in very hot (but not boiling) water for
  approximately 3 minutes until it curls. Then rinse under cold running
  water for approximately 1 hour until it expands. Drain and cut into
  strips.
  
  2.  Shred vegetable ingredients, and blanch slightly in boiling
  water. Then rinse under cold running water until they are cold, and
  drain.
  
  3.  Stir-fry sesame seeds in a dry wok until they are golden.
  
  4.  Mix jelly fish and vegetables with salt, sugar and sesame oil.
  
  5.  Sprinkle sesame seeds over mixture.

  Close door quickly; turn off oven heat. Leave in oven 3 hours or
  overnight, without opening door. Remove meringues from foil.
  
  To fill torte: Let ice cream soften slightly. Place a meringue layer
  on serving plate; spoon chocolate ice cream atop and spread evenly
  (work quickly); place in freezer. Spread second meringue with
  pistachio ice cream; set atop first layer in freezer. Spread third
  meringue with strawberry ice cream , set atop others. Frost remaining
  meringue with whipped cream, and add. Freeze till ice cream is firm,

  dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and place
  in a warm, draft-free place, and allow to rise for an additional 30
  minutes. You can also do this step in the machine by punching the
  dough down, closing the machine, and letting the dough rise for 30
  minutes.
  
  Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and cut it in half to
  make it more manageable. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Roll it
  out to 1/3" thick.  Flour a doughnut cutter and cut out doughnuts.
  Lift each doughnut, pat it to remove excess flour, and place it on a
  lightly oiled or sprayed baking sheet.  Cover the doughnuts with a
  clean towel and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
  
  Put 1/2 cup powdered sugar in sturdy paper bag and spread out paper
  towels near frying pan.  Heat 2" oil in a medium saucepan or deep
  fryer to 375øF. Slide 2 or 3 doughnuts at a time into the hot oil.
  Turn them frequently and spoon the hot oil over them until they are
  well puffed. Drain the doughnuts on paper towels and shake them with
  the sugar in the bag while they are still warm.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Pork (lean and fat mixed)
           Salt and pepper
      1 ts Mixed dried herbs
    1/4 pt Jellied stock (made from
           -pork bones)

MMMMM----------------------HOT WATER CRUST---------------------------
      1 lb Plain flour
      1 ts Salt
      7 oz Lard
  7 1/2 fl Milk and warm water (mixed
           -in equal proportions)
           Milk (for glaze) - optional
           A jar (eg. a kilner jar)*
 
  Dice pork for filling, season well and add herbs. For hot water
  crust: warm a mixing bowl and sift in flour and salt, make a well in
  the centre of the flour. Heat lard in milk and water. When just
  boiling, pour into the well in the flour, stir quickly with a wooden
  spoon until thick, then work with hand to a dough. Turn on to a board
  or table, cut off a quarter of the dough, put it back in the bowl and
  cover with a cloth.
  
  Pat out the rest of dough with the fist to a thick round, set a large
  jar in the centre and work dough up sides. Let dough cool then gently
  lift out jar.  Fill dough case with meat mixture. Roll or pat out
  remaining dough to form a lid, leave a small hole in it, then put on
  top of pie, seal edges. Glaze with milk if wished.
  
  Slide pie on to a baking sheet and bake in pre-set oven for 1-1 1/2
  hours at 350 F.  If pie is getting too brown, cover with damp
  greasproof paper towards end of cooking time. Leave till cool before
  placing a funnel in hole in lid and filling up with jellied stock.
  
  WATCHPOINT You must work quickly and mould pastry while it is still
  warm, otherwise lard sets and pastry becomes brittle. (I make small
  ones using small jars or straight sided glasses)
  
  * Please don't ask me what a kilner jar is 'cause I don't know. I'll
  ask on the net B-)

  yeast. Let stand to dissolve for 5 minutes. Add the milk, butter,
  salt, sugar and flour to the yeast mixture and beat until smooth and
  blended. You can use a hand-rotary beater to get rid of the lumps.
  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let stand overnight at room
  temperature. Just before cooking the waffles, beat in the eggs, add
  the baking soda, and stir until well mixed. The batter will be very
  thin. Pour about 1/2-to-3/4 cup batter into a very hot waffle iron.
  Bake the waffles until they are golden and crisp. This batter will

      1 ts Salt

  first when you add raisins the bread won't rise as high and when you
  add bran or other types of flour bread won't rise as high.
   I take it this recipe came with the book. I have made hundreds of
  loaves of raisins bread and not one has been the same. I change
  something each time. This is my favorite. I hope you like this. I
  also like the sourdough raisin bread replace 1 cup of water with
  starter also take 5 cardamom seeds and take out of pod add whole
  leave out the oatmeal or add more water.

  * Use Grated Raw Potato Starter Roll the dough into a rectangle with
  the width equal to the length of the pan (medium size loaf) and about
  twice as long.  Brush with canned milk. Scatter raisins over surface.
  Mix vanilla sugar, cinnamon and allspice together and sprinkle on
  evenly. (if vanilla sugar is not available, dribble 1 tsp. of vanilla
  extract over dough.) Roll up tightly but do not seal ends.  Place
  seam-side down in pan. Butter top generously and push sharp pointed
  knife down through the dough almost to bottom at regular intervals to
  allow air bubbles between layers to escape. Set in warm place to rise
  and when ready for the oven, spread with the well-mixed topping (the
  cornstarch will help to bind the topping to the crust so that it will
  not crack off badly when sliced). Bake in oven preheated to 350 for
  50 to 60 minutes. Cool before slicing.

  Sweet sauces with pork or game are classic.  This one combines a
  little sweetness with the acidity of vinegar for a delightfully
  different taste. Serve it with that Easter ham for rave reviews.
  Prepare this sauce no more than two days in advance and refrigerate
  it. Rewarm over low heat before serving.
  
  In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar and mustard in the vinegar. Place
  the mixture in a medium-size heavy saucepan, and add the brown sauce
  and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes. Stir in the raisins and
  simmer 5 minutes longer.  Serve hot.
  
  Yield:  About 1 cup of sauce.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  4 1/4 c  All-purpose flour (up to 4
           -1/2 cups)
      4 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Granulated sugar
      1 tb Caraway seeds
      1 c  Dark seedless raisins
      2 c  Buttermilk
           Butter
           Sugar
 
  Preheat the oven to 350F.  Grease a 9-inch black cast-iron skillet or
  cake pan and dust with flour.
  
  In a large bowl, mix 4 cups of the flour with the baking powder,
  baking soda, salt, sugar, and caraway seeds. Add the raisins, mixing
  them in with your fingers to make sure they are separated. Add the
  buttermilk to the bowl and mix with a fork until the mixture forms a
  dough.
  
  Sprinkle about 1/4 cup more of the flour on a board or counter. Turn
  out the dough and knead for about 5 minutes, working in the flour
  from the board and forming the dough into a smooth round loaf about 8
  inches in diameter.  (If the humidity is high and the dough is very
  sticky, you may need to add another 1/4 cup of flour to the board.)
  
  Press the dough evenly into the prepared skillet or pan and cut a
  cross 1/2 inch deep across the top. Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes,
  or until the loaf sounds hollow when rapped on the bottom.  Remove
  the loaf to a wire rack and rub the top with butter. Sprinkle with
  sugar. Let the bread cool completely before slicing.
  
  This Irish bread tastes even better the second day and is
  particularly good for breakfast.
  
  Makes one large loaf.

 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Mashed bananas
      1 c  Prune puree (or prune
           Babyfood)
  1 1/2 c  Brown sugar
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Skim milk soured (1 T.lemon
           Juice, add milk to 1/2c.)
      2 tb Egg replacer + 1/2c. water
      2 ts Vanilla
      1 ts Salt (I omit)
      2 ts Baking soda
      4 c  Flour
      5 c  Quick oats
      2 c  Raisins
      1 c  Chocolate or carob chipa
      1 c  Chopped nuts (optional)
 
  Cream bananas, prune mixture, and sugars.  Add egg replacer/water and
  beat thoroughly.  Add in vanilla, salt, baking soda, flour, and oats,
  beating at medium speed after eaach addition. Stir in other
  ingredients. Spray baking sheets lightly.  Drop heaped soup spoonfuls
  onto sheets. Bake at 400 degrees F. for 15-25 min. (depends on
  altitude) until slightly brown and slightly crisp on the outside.
  
  NOTE:  I've been making these at 7200 feet altitude. I cut the baking
  soda to 1 1/2 tsp.  You may want to cut the liquids some at lower
  altitude.
  
  Adding the soured milk.  I usually beat it in with the egg
  replacer/water.
  
  I cut the sugar, replaced half the bananas with prune puree, and added
  soured milk to make a softer cooky. This makes a very large amount.
  Use your largest bowl for mixing them. I usually bake some and
  refrigerate the remainder of the dough until the next week.

  PHULKA PUFFED WHOLE WHEAT BREAD
  
  to make 5 six inch breads
  
  1 cup flour 1/4 to 1/2 cup water
  
  Place the flour in a deep bowl, make a well in the center and pour in
  1/4 cup of the water. With your fingers or a spoon blend the water
  into the flour. Then knead or beat the mixture together vigouously
  until it can be gathered into a compact ball. If the dough crumbles
  add up to 1/4 cup more water, 1 tbsp at a time until the particles
  adhere. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough by folding it
  end to end, then pressing it down and pushing it forward several
  times with the heal of your hand. Repeat for 10 minutes, or until the
  dough is smooth and elastic. Again gather it into a ball, place it in
  a bowl and drape a dampened kitchen towel over the top. Set aside and
  let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature. To
  shape each phulka, devide the dough into 5 equal portions and form
  each one into a ball. On al lightly floured surface, roll each ball
  intop a round about 6 inches in diameter. As you proceed, cover the
  phulkas with a damp kitchen towel. Heat an ungreased 10 to 12 inch
  skillet with a nonstick finish or a well seasoned cast iron skillet
  or griddle until it is hot evough for a drop of water flicked into it
  to splutter instantly. Place one of the phulkas in the pan and,
  moving it about constantly with your fingers or the edge of a metal
  spatula, cook kit for a minute or so, until the top begins to darken.
  Turn the phulka over and cook for 1 minute longer, or until it is
  lightly browned. Then, holding a folded linen kitchen towel in one
  hand, press it down gently but firmly on the bread. Lift your hand
  away and the phulka should puff almost instantly. Remove the towel
  and slide the phulka onto a heated plate. Serve the Phulka warm as a
  mealtime bread If requested I have recipe for following Indian

  Remove the seeds and veins from the chiles and cut them into strips
  about 1 1/2 inhes long and 1/2 inch wide. If the chiles seem too
  picante, soak them in salted water for about 30 minutes.
  
  Heat the oil and fry the onions gently, without browning them, until
  they are soft.
  
  Add the chile strips, tomatoes and salt to the onions in the pan. Cook
  uncovered, over a fairly high flame until the vegetables are well

      8    Chiles poblanos; roasted and

  1 1/2 md Onions; thinly sliced
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  Recipe by: The Cuisines of Mexico by Diana Kennedy ISBN 0-06-012344-3
  In the central and northern part of Mexico, where the chile poblano
  is used a great deal, to ask for rajas most commonly means strips of
  chile poblano cooked in this way. It makes an excellent accompaniment
  for broiled meats.
  
  Remove the seeds and veins from the chiles and cut them into strips
  about 1 1/2 inhes long and 1/2 inch wide. If the chiles seem too
  picante, soak them in salted water for about 30 minutes.
  
  Heat the oil and fry the onions gently, without browning them, until
  they are soft.
  
  Add the chile strips and salt to the onions in the pan, cover, and
  cook gently for about 8 minutes.
  
  You can always prepare these ahead of time and they will keep in the
  refriegerator for several days. They are inclined to get a bit soggy
  if you freeze them.

  that's just a bonus!) I've been putting recipes into my computer from

  and ran across this.

 Categories: Side dishes, Kooknet
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Pinto or Pink Beans
      1    Ham Hock
      1    Onion; chopped
      2    Cloves Garlic; minced
      3 ts Pure Chile Powder
           Salt
           Black Pepper
 
  Pick over beans for debris; rinse well and drain. Place in a 4 quart
  pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil, simmer 3 minutes. Remove
  from heat, cover, and let soak for at least 4 hours.
  
  Pour off water. Add 5 cups fresh water, or just enough to cover beans.
  Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to maintain a gentle bubbling.
  Add ham bone, onion and garlic. Partially cover (a whisper of steam
  should escape.) Cook 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until beans are not
  sticking; give them a stir. Keep a kettle with hot water on stove --
  if cooking liquid drops below the level of the beans, add no more
  than 1/2 cup water.
  
  When beans are tender, add chile powder, salt and pepper. Simmer 30
  minutes longer. Scoop out 2 cups beans with a little cooking liquid.
  Roughly puree in blender on low speed. Stir puree back into beans and
  cook for a few minutes, stirring, until beans have thickened.

  Mix the persimmon puree and the baking soda together and let it stand.
  Cream together the sugar and butter, then add the egg, milk, vanilla,
  (rum), and persimmon mixture. Add the remaining dry ingredients and
  mix.
  
  Pour into well-buttered pudding mold or tin can (i.e., a coffee can).
  Fill them only 2/3 full. Place the mold on a trivet in a pan over a
  few inches of boiling water. (I use one of those folding steamer
  baskets). Cover the pan and steam over low heat for 2 hours. You will
  need to add more boiling water as it evaporates. When a skewer tests
  clean, it is done.
  
  Let stand in the mold uncovered for about 15 minutes. Turn onto a
  plate and let cool, or serve warm with hard sauce or whipped cream.
  Beat the egg yolk with powdered sugar and rum or brandy. Fold in
  whipped egg white and whipped cream.

  baking soda, and salt. Mix dry ingedients to blend. Add, rice
  krispies, rolled oats, coconut, pecans and chocolate chips.
  
  Begin adding dry ingredients to creamed crisco mixture, this mixture
  will get stiff, and unless you have dough hooks, it will become
  necessary to mix by hand.If needed add a Tablespoon of water to
  moisten just a bit After you have added all ingredients and they are
  well blended. roll dough into small to med balls and place on cookie
  sheet. Flatten dough with fork, and Bake at 325 F. for 8 to 10
  minutes.
  
  NOTE: this makes at least 8 doz. cookies. I have made the recipe and
  refrigerated  dough during the holidays.( great for those of us who
  like hot cookies and milk. I also have cut recipe in half and that
  works well for me. This recipe is quite old and given to me by an
  aunt of 76 years old. When she said by hand after working in some of
  the dry ingredients she means BY  HAND, said get right in  there and
  toss the dough around blending it well.

  mixture. Cooking batches of only 4 to 6 cups of fruit at a time,
  measure out 3/4 cup of sugar for each cup of fruit and combine fruit
  and sugar in a preserving kettle. Bring mixture slowly to a boil,
  stirring frequently until sugar has dissolved. Then boil rapidly for
  about 20 minutes until jellying point is reached. Test for jellying
  point with a jelly thermometer which should read 200 to 222 F, or
  with a spoon which, when dipped into mixture, has 2 drops form along
  the edge, come together and fall as 1 drop. Ladle into hot,
  sterilized jars and seal immediately.
  
  To seal:  Fill to within 1/2-inch head room, being sure to first wipe
  the rim and threads of the jars with a hot damp cloth to remove all
  particles of food, seeds or spices. While contents are hot, cover
  with a 1/8-inch layer of paraffin.  When paraffin has set, add
  another layer of melted paraffin, tilting and rotating the jar to

 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
     12 lb Prime rib roast
           Salt to taste
           Black pepper to taste
 
  Remove roast from the refrigerator ast least two hours before
  beginning to cook. Place in a shallow roasting pan and liberally
  sprinkle fatty top with salt and pepper. Pat in. To protect the oven
  from spattering fat, place a tent of aluminum foil loosely over the
  top of the meat. Preheat the oven to 500*F and when preheated place
  roast in oven and roast for the times listed below. THE TIMES MUST
  ABE ADHERED TO EXACTLY. Set a timer to remind you as a few minutes of
  overcooking will ruin the roast. When the cooking time ends, turn off
  the oven but DO NOT open the door. Allow the roast to remain in the
  oven for at least 1 hour or until the oven is luke warm, which occurs
  in about 2 hours. The roast will be beautifully rare inside and
  retain a crunchy outside and an internal heat suitable for serving
  for 2 hours. The roasting time works out to 15 minutes per rib or
  approximately 5 minutes per pound. NOTES:  1. For a 2 rib roast
  weighing 41/2 -5 lbs. allow 25 to 30 minutes at 500*F
        2. For a 3 rib roast weighing 8-9 lbs. allow 40-45 minutes at
  500*F
        3. For a 4 rib roast weighing 11-12 lbs. allow 55-60 minutes at
  500*F
        4. Have your butcher prepare the roast by removing the chine
  bone and cutting the meat from the bones. Then return the chine bone
  and the meat to its original shape and tie the roast to hold it
  together. This will facilitate your carving.
        5. A small end Prime rib is always the best.

      1 l  Homogenized Milk
      2 ts White Vinegar
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      3 c  Water
 
  1. Bring the milk to a boil and add vinegar to the boiling milk to
  separate the whey. 2. Throw away the liquid part by sifting the stuff
  onto a muslin cloth. 3. Pour some cold water over the curd to cool
  and wash it. Throw the water and hang the cloth for 15-20 minutes to
  let the excess water drip off. 4. Put the curd in a food processor or
  blender and blend at high speed to get a smooth consistency. You may
  add just a little (1 tsp or so) water while blending, if the curd is
  too dry and will not blend. Be very careful so as not to add any
  extra water. 5. Remove the paste and make small balls (1 to 2 inches
  in diameter). 6. Boil water in a wide vessel. Make sure that there is
  at least 2-3 inches of water in the vessel. If not, put more water
  and increase the quantity of sugar proportionately. Add sugar to
  boiling water to make a light syrup. 7. Continue boiling the syrup
  and gently drop the curd balls in the boiling syrup. Cook the balls
  in the boiling syrup for 30-40 minutes. 8. Remove from the heat and
  let the stuff cool down. Put the balls and the syrup in a storage
  container and refrigerate (don't freeze). 9. Serve cold.

  1 1/4 l  ;Water
 
  Rub the paneer and ricotta cheese with palm of your hand until smooth

  *PANEER (Home-made cottage cheese) 3.5 litres milk about 250ml warm
  water about 5 Tbsp white vinegar
  
  1. Bring the milk to the boil, stirring constantly, over a high heat.
  Remove from heat.
  
  2. Combine the water and vinegar.
  
  3. Slowly add the vinegar solution to the boiled milk, stirring with a
  wooden spoon. As soon as the milk curdles, do not add any more. (The
  curd and whey will separate.)
  
  4. Place three or four layers of cheesecloth in a sieve and strain the
  curdled milk through them. Ties up the ends of the cheesecloth and
  squeeze out as much of the liquid as possible. Hang it up to drain
  thoroughly.
  
  Note: When adding the water and vinegar mixture to the milk, do not
  add more than necessary as this tends to harden the paneer.

 Categories: Desserts, Fruits
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 md Peaches; peeled & pits
           -removed
      2 tb Raspberry vinegar;up to 3 tb
      2 tb Sugar, powdered; or to taste
      2 c  Raspberries, fresh
    1/2 c  Creme fraiche; up to 3/4
 
  "To peel peaches, bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Drop 1
  peach at a time gently into the boiling water, leave it for 5
  seconds, and retrieve it by piercing the flesh with a fork. With a
  paring knife, slit the skin, which will then slip off easily." "This
  puree can be made several hours ahead but should be stirred before
  spooning onto the plates. The raspberry vinegar holds the color of
  the peaches, add a subtle tang, and heightens the flavor of the
  raspberries. Pears may be substituted for the peaches and can simply
  be peeled without first being dipped into boiling water." Puree the
  peaches in a food processor or a food mill fitted with the finest
  disk. (There should be about 1 cup puree.) Add the raspberry vinegar
  and enough of the powdered sugar to balance the taste. Refrigerate
  until serving time. Divide the puree among 4 dessert plates, spooning
  it into a semicircle. Nestle a quarter of the raspberries beside each
  serving of puree and pass the creme fraiche separately.

      Title: RASPBERRY BARS
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Flour
      1 c  Brown sugar, packed
      1 ts Salt
      2 c  Quick-cooking oatmeal
      1 c  Butter
  1 1/2 c  Seedless raspberry jam,*
    1/2 c  Chopped pecans
 
  * or preserves or conserve
  
   Bar cookies are easy to prepare because they are spread in a pan and
  baked all at one time. They should be cooled before cutting.
  
   This is such an easy recipe-but it tastes like you spent hours
  preparing it. It's great for brunch and coffee klatches!
  
   Preheat oven to 375ø.
  
   In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, salt and oatmeal. Cut in all
  but two tablespoons butter. Press 1/2 of flour mixture evenly into a
  greased 13 x 9-inch pan. Spread jam over batter in pan, then top with
  remaining flour mixture. Dot with two tablespoons butter and with
  chopped pecans.
  
   Bake at 375ø for 20-25 minutes. Let cool completely, then cut into
  rectangles.
  
   Variation: Use other types of jam, such as apricot.

 Categories: Pudding, Raspberry, Canadian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  Milk
    2/3 c  Granulated sugar
      4    Egg yolks
      1 pn Salt
      1 tb Unflavored gelatin
      2 tb Water
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      1 c  Whipping cream
      2 c  Fresh raspberries; or 1

           -raspberries
           Raspberries and mint to
           -garnish
 
  In a saucepan, combine milk with 1/3 cup of the sugar; heat until
  scalding. In a bowl, beat egg yolks with remaining sugar and salt.
  Slowly whisk hot milk into the egg mixture. Return to saucepan and
  cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until custard
  thickens enough to coat a wooden spoon. Do not let mixture boil or it
  will curdle.
  
  Sprinkle gelatin over water to soften; stir into hot custard and
  remove from heat. Add vanilla and strain sauce through a fine sieve.
  Cool custard by setting pan in a larger container filled with ice
  cubes. Stir occasionally until sauce starts to thicken and become
  syrupy.
  
  Whip cream until stiff. Puree raspberries in a food processor or
  blender and then strain through a sieve to remove seeds (use spoon to
  press juice through sieve and a rubber spatula to help remove it from
  the other side). Fold whipped cream into custard, then fold in pureed
  strained raspberries.
  
  Rinse a 6-cup mould with cold water. Pour in custard mixture and
  cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours or
  overnight. To serve, dip mould briefly in warm water, dry off and
  place serving plate over top. Quickly invert and turn out onto
  serving plate. Trim with fresh berries or mint leaves.

      Title: RASPBERRY BORSCHT
 Categories: Soups, Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 lb Beets; or more
           Water
      1 pn Salt
      1 pt Raspberries
    1/4 c  Red onion; minced
    1/2 c  Lemon juice, fresh
      3 tb Balsamic vinegar
      3 tb Sugar
           Lemon juice; to taste
           Sugar; to taste
 
  Cut the tops off the beets, scrub them thoroughly, and put them in a
  saucepan with enough water to cover them by an inch and a little
  pinch of salt. Simmer the beets, covered, for 30 minutes if they're
  small, closer to 45 if large. They must be tender.
  
  Drain the beets, reserving the cooking liquid, and allow them to
  cool. When you can handle them, peel them and cut them into quarters
  or eighths.
  
  Combine the beets, raspberries, red onion, and 2 cups of the reserved
  cooking liquid, and puree it all in batches in a blender. Strain the
  puree through a sieve to remove the raspberry seeds. Stir in 1/2 cup
  of lemon juice, the balsamic vinegar, and 3 tablespoons of sugar.
  Stir until the sugar is dissolved, and taste. Add more lemon juice
  and more sugar only if needed, until the right sweet-sour balance is
  achieved. You might need a teensy pinch of salt, but be careful.
  
  Chill the soup in the refrigerator, and when it is completely cold,
  taste it again. Correct the seasoning if necessary. Serve in chilled
  bowls, with a spoonful of sour cream in the center of each one.

     24    Amaretti Cookies
    1/4 c  Chambord
    1/2 pt Fresh Raspberries
 
  * such as Haagen Dazs Raspberry Sorbet and Cream.
  
  Make the raspberry sauce:
  
  1. In a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade, combine
  the raspberries, sugar, Chambord, and lemon juice. Process the
  mixture for 30 to 45 seconds, or until smooth. Strain the pure
  through a fine-meshed sieve into a small bowl. Cover with plastic
  wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, until chilled.
  
  Assemble the sundaes:
  
  1. In a chilled 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer,
  using the wire whip attachment, beat the cream, sugar, and vanilla at
  medium-high speed until slightly stiff peaks begin to form. Transfer
  the cream to a pastry bag fitted with a star tip (such as Ateco #7)
  and refrigerate the cream until ready to use.
  
  2. Spoon about l 1/2 tablespoons of the raspberry sauce into the
  bottom of a large sundae glass. Add 4 or 5 raspberries. Coarsely
  crumble 2 amaretti cookies over the berries and drizzle with 1
  teaspoon Chambord. Place a small scoop of the raspberry sorbet and
  vanilla ice cream on top of the cookie layer. Drizzle about 1 1/2
  tablespoons of the chocolate syrup over the scoop. Top with a scoop
  of chocolate ice cream and a drizzle of raspberry sauce and 4 or 5
  raspberries. Coarsely crumble 2 more amaretti cookies over the
  berries and drizzle with 1 teaspoon Chambord. Top with a scoop of
  raspberry sorbet and vanilla ice cream. Drizzle with some of the
  raspberry sauce. Pipe a large rosette of whipped cream on top of the

      Title: RASPBERRY CHOCOLATE MERINGUE ICEBOX CAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      4 lg Egg whites
    1/4 ts Cream of tartar
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
  2 3/4 c  Heavy cream
      6 oz Fine quality bittersweet
           -chocolate (not unsweetened)
  1 1/2 ts Unflavored gelatin
      3 tb Cold water
  1 1/2 c  Sour cream
      1 ts Vanilla
      3 pt Fresh raspberries
 
  1. Preheat oven to 250F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and
  trace 3 8-inch circles onto the paper.
  
  2. In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat whites with cream of
  tartar and add a pinch of salt until they just hold soft peaks. Add 1
  cup sugar gradually, beating, and beat meringue until it holds stiff
  peaks. Transfer meringue to a pastry bag fitted with a 3/4 inch plain
  tip and pipe onto circles, filling them in. Smooth meringues with a
  long metal spatula or knife. Alternatively, if pastry bag isn't used,
  circles may be made by spreading meringues freehanded with spatula.
  
  3. Bake meringues 30 minutes and switch positions of baking sheets in
  oven. Bake meringues 30 minutes more, or until pale golden and crisp.
  (If the weather is humid, cooking time may be longer.) Cool meringues
  completely and peel off paper. Meringues may be made 1 day ahead and
  kept in turned-off oven.
  
  4. In a saucepan, bring 1/4 cup heavy cream just to a boil and remove
  from heat. Add chocolate and stir mixture until chocolate is melted
  completely. Divide ganache between 2 meringue layers and gently
  spread evenly, leaving 1/2 inch borders. Chill ganache until
  hardened, about 10 minutes.
  
  5. In a small saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over water and soften 1 min.
  Heat mixture over low heat, stirring until gelatin is dissolved, and
  keep warm. In a bowl with an electric mixer, beat remaining 2 1/2
  cups heavy cream with remaining 1/2 cup sugar until it just holds
  stiff peaks and then beat in sour cream and vanilla. Add gelatin
  mixture in a stream, beating, and beat until mixture holds stiff
  peaks.
  
  6. Arrange 1 ganache-topped meringue on a plate and spread it with 1
  1/2 cups cream mixture, mounding it at the edge. Arrange 1 pint of
  raspberries over the cream mixture and top with the second ganache-
  topped meringue. Repeat procedure with about 1 1/2 cups more cream
  mixture and another pint of raspberries and top with the third
  meringue.
  
  7. Transfer about 1 cup more cream mixture to a pastry bag fitted
  with the star tip and reserve for decoration. Frost top and side of
  cake with remaining cream mixture and decorate with reserved mixture.
  Chill cake for at least 2 hours and up to 8 hours. Remove wax paper
  carefully and scatter remaining  pint of raspberries around and on
  the cake. Cut into 12 wedges with a serrated or electric knife.

      Title: RASPBERRY CURRANT COULIS (RODEGRUETT)
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Red currants, stems removed,
           -washed
  1 1/4 c  Raspberries, washed
      3 c  Water
      1 c  To 1 1/2 c sugar (depending
           -on tartness of the berries)
    1/2    Vanilla bean
      5 tb To 6 tb cornstarch,
           -dissolved in 3/4 cup cold
           -water
 
  Cook the berries for 15 minutes in the water - until they are quite
  soft. Press through a fine strainer; add to the fruit juice the sugar
  and the vanilla scraped out of a slit bean, bring to a boil in a
  non-reactive pot, and reduce while stirring vigorously. Add the
  dissolved cornstarch to the sweetened fruit juice.  Bring to a boil
  once more, then transfer the 'Rodegruett' to a glass baking dish that
  has been rinsed with cold water. Chill in the refrigerator and serve.
  
  Note:
  
  Nowadays it is more customary to serve 'Rodegruett' in individual
  bowls rather than a giant family-size trencher. Serve with cream,
  cold milk, or cold Vanilla Sauce which only should be poured over the
  'groats' before you're ready to eat.
  
  Make sure the 'groats' are not too thick.  The correct consistency is
  somewhere between that of a pudding and a puree (like thick pea
  soup). When you first taste 'Rodegruett' made according to these
  specifications, it may easily seem too sweet or the berry flavor may
  seem a little overwhelming. However, bear in mind that after the
  'groats' have cooled off a bit and milk or cream has been poured over
  them, the taste will be considerably milder.
  
  Variations:
  
  Some or all of the strained berry pulp may be replace with an
  equivalent amount of fruit juice, and quick-frozen berries or
  preserves will do just about as well as fresh ones. Cherries,
  morellos (sour cherries), and black currants are often used instead
  of or in addition to red currants and raspberries. Many cooks like to
  hold back some portion of the berries until after the straining so
  they don't cook down like the others and you can still taste them
  while eating the dish.
  
  Tapioca is often used as a binding agent, and there are those who
  maintain that this is the only 'authentic' method of making
  'Rodegruett'. In Saxony and East Prussia, red griats have been made
  with farina (semolina) for a number of years now, and since the words
  for farina ('Griess') and groats ('Gruetze') are closely related,
  sometimes even used interchangeably, it is no less possible that this
  is in fact the 'original' version. All questions of authenticity
  aside, a deluxe fortified 'Rodegruett' can be made by stewing the
  berries in red wine or with some higher-proof alcoholic beverage.
  
  Makes 4 to 6 servings.

      Title: RASPBERRY JAM
 Categories: Fruits, Preserves
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     12 c  Raspberries (6 pints)
      3 c  Sugar
  1 1/3 c  Homemade pectin
      2 tb Fresh lemon juice
 
  Pick over the raspberries for any leaves or unusable fruit. There
  should be 3 packed quarts.  Combine with the sugar in a large bowl
  and let stand at room temperature for 6 hours or overnight in the
  refrigerator. Stir occasionally. Stir together the raspberry mixture,
  pectin, and lemon juice in a large shallow nonreactive preserving pan
  and place over high heat. Bring to a full boil, skimm off foam, then
  lower heat to medium. Stir often so the bottom does not burn. When
  the jam is sufficiently thickened, the bubbles on top will become
  smaller and the jam will look like bubbling tar. This takes
  approximately 20 minutes, depending on the size of the pan. If the
  jam is still too liquid, continue cooking for 5 minutes more and test
  again. Turn off the heat and remove a tablespoon of jam to a small
  plate to test.
   Chill in the freezer for 5 minutes.  If the jam is the consistency
  desired, turn the heat to low while ladling the jam into hot
  sterilized jars.  Wipe rims clean with a damp towel. Seal with new
  lids and metal rings.  Process in a hot-water bath for 5 minutes.
  Remove, cool, check seals, label, and store.

           Slightly more than 1/2 cup
           Butter
      1 tb Sugar
        pn Salt
  1 1/2 oz Cocoa
 
  Mix flour and softened butter, sugar, salt and chocolate with a wooden
  spoon in a large bowl.  Lay in and 8 inch glass oven dish, covering
  the bottom and sides as though it were a pie. (It is very crumbly
  because it is so short.) (Meaning short pastry.)  Put in preheat 300F
  oven for 15 minutes.  (The cake will be half-cooked when you remove
  it.)
  
  Then make the following meringue:
  
        3    egg whites 1 cup sugar
      1/2    teaspoon wine vinegar 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 pint fresh
  raspberries
  
  With an electric mixer, beat the egg whites, sugar and vinegar for 10
  minutes at high speed.  Add vanilla and beat another 5 minutes. Fold
  the cleaned raspberries into the meringue. Fill the half-cooked cake
  with the meringue and put in oven for another 15 to 20 minutes at
  250F.
  
  ***The original form of this cake used fresh currants, but as they are
  rarely available the Marquesa substituted raspberries.
  
  Dustings on the top of this cake would only add to its presentation. A
  dusting of chocolate powder, I think.

  mounds. Shape with the back of a spoon to form bird nest shapes. Bake
  at 275 degrees F for one hour.  Turn off oven and let dry with the
  door closed for at least another 1 1/2 hours.  If meringues will not
  be used immediately, place into an airtight container to store, or
  they can be left in an oven which has a pilot light overnight.
  
  Place meringues on serving plates.  Place a large scoop of vanilla
  frozen yogurt (or vanilla ice cream) into each meringue, smother with
  fresh raspberries, drizzle with Chambord, Framboise, or other

 Categories: Desserts, Fruits, Kooknet, Cyberealm
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      6 tb Cold Butter
    3/4 c  Flour
    1/4 ts Salt

      1 tb Powdered Sugar
 
  Cut the butter into pieces. In the bowl of a food processor, combine
  the flour, salt and butter and pulse until the mixture resembles
  coarse meal. Add the sour cream and process until the dough just
  holds together. Press into a disc, wrap and refrigerate at least 2
  hours. Flour the dough and roll out between 2 sheets of waxed paper
  to 1/8" thick, about an 11 x 11" square. Transfer the dough to a
  baking sheet and prick all over with a fork. Refrigerate 30 minutes.
  Preheat the oven to 375øF. Bake the dough until lightly browned,
  15-20 minutes. Let cool completely. Trim pastry to an 8 x 8" square
  and cut it into eight 2 x 4" rectangles.
  
  Beat the heavy cream with the sugar and vanilla until it holds firm
  peaks. Put the whipped cream in a pastry bag fitted with a star tip
  and pipe half of it onto for of the rectangles. Arrange the
  raspberries on top of the cream, then pipe a second layer of cream
  over the raspberries. Top the cream with the remaining pastry
  rectangles, flat side up. Cover and refrigerate until serving. Before
  serving, dust each Napoleon with powdered sugar.

  juice and add to raspberry mixture. Cook, stirring, for about 45
  seconds, or until thickened and no longer cloudy. Remove from the
  heat and stir in chambord or framboise and the remaining 1/3 cup
  raspberries. Cool to room temperature. ( The recipe can be prepared
  ahead to this point. Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days. Bring to
  room temperature before proceeding. )
     Position rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat oven to
  350 degrees. Lightly coat the inside(s) of a 1 1/2-quart souffle dish
  or six 1 1/2-cup individual souffle dishes with vegetable oil or
  nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle with sugar and shake out excess.
     In a large, grease-free mixing bowl, beat egg whites with an
  electric mixer on medium speed until foamy and opaque. Add cream of
  tartar and salt; gradually increase speed to high and beat until soft
  peaks form. Gradually add remaining 3 tablespoons sugar and beat
  until stiff ( but not dry ) peaks form.
     Stir raspberry mixture well. Whisk about one-quarter of the beaten
  egg whites into the raspberry mixture to lighten it. Using a rubber
  spatula, fold the raspberry mixture back into the remaining whites.
  Turn into prepared dish(es) and smooth top(s) with spatula. Place
  dish(es) in a roasting pan. Fill pan with hot water to come one-third
  of the way up side of the dish(es). Bake until puffed and top is firm
  to the touch, about 25 minutes for individual souffles and about 35
  minutes for a large souffle. Dust with confectioner's sugar and serve
  immediately. Serve 6. Source: Ahn Dao

  protecting the edges with aluminium foil. Leave it to cool in its tin.
  
  Reduce the oven temperature to 190 oC/375 oF.
  
  Whisk the egg, egg yolks, sugar and cream together, making sure the
  sugar dissolves.
  
  Arrange the raspberries on the bottom of the pre-cooked pastry shell,
  pointed ends facing upwards, in concentric circles. Cover them with
  the egg mixture.
  
  Bake the tart for about 40 minutes in the bottom of the oven. WATCH
  VERY CAREFULLY TO SEE THAT THE FILLING NEVER REACHES BOILING POINT.
  
  When the tart has cooled completely, take it out of the tin.

      Title: RASPBERRY VINEGAR 2
 Categories: Salad/dress
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 qt Vinegar (type?)
      2 qt Raspberries
           Sugar
 
  To each quart of good vinegar, add two quarts of raspberries. Let
  stand for 24 hours then drain the vinegar off through a sieve. Do not
  squeeze them. Add the same quantity of raspberries again to the
  strained vinegar, letting stand as before for 24 hours. Strain as
  before and add a third quantit. When you have strained the fruit off
  a third time, measure the liquor into a stone covered-jar.  To each
  pint of vinegar, add a pound of lump sugar. Set the jar in a pot of
  boiling water, and let the vinegar boil for ten minutes, stirring it
  to mix the sugar well through;when cold, bottle it for use. It is all
  the better for standing for some months before being used.
  
  A cheaper sort might be made with fine moist sugar, or with crushed
  sugar, but must be well scummed. Raspberry vinegar makes an excellent
  fever drink, a small quantity being mixed in a tumbler of cold water.
  It is very refreshing in hot weather, and is made in considerable
  quantities by those who have wild raspberries growing near the
  clearings, and plenty of sugar at command.

  "Bursts with sweet, tangy bite of fresh raspberries, although most any
  in-season berry will work.  Not too gooey and not too sweet..."
  
  My notes:  Took this to Thxgiving gathering and it went over well.
  Very quick and convenient to make, and looks quite presentable.

      Title: RASPBERRY-ALMOND LINZER COOKIES
 Categories: Cookies, Nuts, German
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Blanched almonds (4 oz)
  1 1/2 c  All purpose flour
     12 tb Softened, unsalted butter
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1    Lemon
      2 ts Vanilla
      1    Egg white
    1/8 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Sliced, blanched almonds
      1 c  Seedless raspberry jam
           Confectioners sugar
 
  The classic Viennese nut dough, Mandelmuerbteig, is used here to make
  a 2-layer cookie, filled with raspberry preserves
  
  Put Almonds and flour in the work bowl of a food processor, fitted
  with the metal blade, and process until finely ground.  set aside.
  
  Beat butter in med. bowl until lightened in color and texture, 2-3
  minutes. Add sugar, continue beating until mixture is very light,
  about 5 min. longer. Grate 1 tbsp lemon zest and beat in along with
  vanilla Stir in flour mixture, being careful NOT to over mix. Form
  the dough into a 1/2" thick disk.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate
  until firm (about 1 hour) May be refrigerated overnight
  
  Line 2 baking sheets with parchment.  Cut dough into 4 even pieces;
  set aside 3 pcs. Carefully roll out the dough 1/8" thick on a floured
  surface. Cut out 1.5" circles with plain or fluted cookie cutter.
  Press scraps of dough into a ball; roll and cut out more circles. To
  form the cookie tops, cut out the centers of half of the dough
  circles with a 1/2" canape cutter, or the bottom of a metal pastry
  tip. Put cookie rings and bottoms 1/2" apart on baking sheet. Repeat
  to cut out circles and rings from the remaining pieces of dough.
  
  COOKING: Adjust oven racks to low and middle positions; heat oven to
  325F Whisk the egg white with the salt.  Coarsely chop the almonds or
  crush with rolling pin.  Brush the cookie tops with egg wash and
  sprinkle with crushed almonds.  Bake until cookies are dry and very
  lightly browned (12-15 min.)
  
  If baking two sheets at the same time, switch them after 6 min to
  ensure even cooking. Cool cookies on the baking sheet
  
  Bring 1/2 C jam to a boil in a small saucepan, and simmer until
  slightly thickened (5-8 min)  Brush the cookie bottoms with the jam,
  and top with the cookie rings. Dust with confectioners' sugar.  Use a
  small spoon or pastry bag fitted with a 1/4" tip to fill the holes
  with the remaining jam.
  
  These cookies can be stored in an airtight container, between layers
  of waxed paper for up to 3 weeks.  I also freeze them for up to 1
  month.

      Title: RASPBERRY-BLACKBERRY GRATIN
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3    Egg yolks from extra-large
           -eggs
      1 tb Water
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Framboise (raspberry brandy)
      2 c  Heavy cream, chilled
      3 c  Raspberries
      3 c  Blackberries
 
       Combine the egg yolks, water and sugar in a metal bowl set over,
  but not touching, gently simmering water, or in the top pan of a
  double boiler set over simmering water. Whisk constantly until the
  mixture is foamy and begins to thicken slightly, 2-3 minutes.
  Immediately remove from the heat and strain into a 2-quart metal
  bowl. (The use of a metal bowl will help cool down the mixture more
  quickly.)  Stir in the Framboise, cover and refrigerate for at least
  4 hours or overnight.
       Just before serving, position the rack 3-4 inches from the heat
  source in a broiler and preheat the broiler.
       Using chilled beaters and a large chilled bowl, whip the cream
  until stiff peaks form.  Gently fold the cream into the chilled
  custard. Scatter all the berries over the bottom of a 2-quart
  ovenproof baking dish with at least 1-inch sides.  Place the dish on
  a heavy-duty baking sheet or in a shallow baking pan to make for
  easier removal from the broiler. Gently pour and spoon the custard
  over the berries.
       Broil (grill) until the top is browned and bubbling, 1-1/2 - 2
  minutes.  Serve immediately.

  2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Plus 2 Tabl unsalted butter
           --at room temperature
    1/2 t  Baking powder
    1/2 t  Baking soda
    1/4 t  Salt
    3/4 c  Sour cream
      1 t  Almond extract
      2 lg Eggs
      8 oz Cream cheese, softened

  sour cream, almond extract and 1 egg. Blend well. With oiled hands,
  gently pat the dough over the bottom and 1 1/2 inches up the sides of
  the springform pan; the mixture will be a little sticky.

  sugar, and 1 egg.  Blend well.  Pour into the batter-lined pan. In a
  small saucepan, warm the preserves. Carefully spoon the preserves
  evenly over the cream cheese mixture.  Stir the  sliced almonds into
  the reserved crumb mixture and sprinkle over the preserves. Bake for
  45 to 55 minutes, or until the cream cheese filling is set and the
  crust is deep golden brown. Cool on a rack for 15 minutes, then
  remove from the pan. The cake can be served warm or cool, but it
  should be stored in the refrigerator.

      Title: RASPBERRY-FILLED SANDWICH COOKIES (LUXEMBOURG
 Categories: Cookies, Swedish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  Blanched almond slices
           -(about 4 ounces)
      1 c  Powdered sugar
    1/2 c  Egg whites (4 to 5),
           -completely free of yolk
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Cream of tartar
    1/4 ts Vanilla extract
    1/8 ts (scant) almond extract
           FOR THE RASPBERRY
           -BUTTERCREAM:
  6 1/2 tb Unsalted butter, slightly
           -softened
  1 1/4 c  Powdered sugar
    1/3 c  Seedless raspberry preserves
           -or jam
 
  FOR THE COOKIES:
  
  Heat the oven to 325F.  Line 2 very large baking sheets (or 3 smaller
  ones) with baking parchment. Toast the almonds in the oven, stirring
  occasionally, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until tinged with brown. Set
  aside to cool.  Reset the oven to 300F.
  
  Grind the cooled almonds and 1/2 cup of powdered sugar in a food
  processor until very fine but not oily. Thoroughly stir the remaining
  powdered sugar into the almonds.
  
  Combine the granulated sugar and 3 tablespoons of hot tap water in a
  small heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring just to a boil,
  stirring. Cover the pan and boil for 1 1/2 minutes to allow the steam
  to wasu the sugar crystals from the sides of the pan.  Uncover and
  continue boiling, lifting the pan and swirling the contents
  occasionally, but never stirring, for about 1 minute longer until the
  syrup thickens, bubbles vigorously, and reaches the firm ball stage
  (240 F on a candy thermometer). To test for doneness without a
  thermometer, remove the pan from the heat and drop a small amount of
  the syrup into a cup of ice water; let stand for 10 seconds.  The
  syrup should form a firm ball when squeezed between the fingers.  Set
  the syrup aside.
  
  Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on medium speed until
  frothy. Add the cream of tartar, raising the mixer speed to high.
  Continue beating just to soft peaks; turn off mixer. Return the syrup
  to the burner and reheat just to simmering.  With the mixer on high
  speed, immediately pour a thin, steady stream of syrup down the side
  of the bowl (avoid the beaters or whip as the syrup will stick) until
  all of the syrup is added. Add the vanilla and almond extracts.
  Continue beating until the mixture cools to lukewarm.
  
  Use a rubber spatula to fold the almond mixture evenly into the
  beaten egg whites.  Immediately drop the mixture from small spoons
  into 1-inch kisses spacing about 3/4 inch apart on the parchment
  lined baking sheets. (Alternately, pipe the mixture into 1-inch
  rounds using a pastry bag fitted with a plain or open star 3/8-inch
  diameter tip.) Place the pans staggered on racks in the center half
  of the oven.  Bake for 19 to 22 minutes, reversing pans from front to
  back and switching racks about halfway through, until barely tinged
  and firm on top but still slightly soft inside. Let the pans stand on
  wire racks until the meringues are completely cooled.  Peel from the
  paper.  Store aiftight until assembled.
  
  To prepare the buttercream:  Beat togather the butter, powdered
  sugar, and preserves until light and fluffy. Spread with a knife (or
  pipe using a pastry bag and tibe) small amounts of the cream over the
  flat sides of half the cookies.  Top with the r4emaining meringues,
  pressing together tightly. Store the cookies airtight and
  refrigerated for up to 24 hours; they will soften too much if left
  longer.  (For longer storage, freze, tightly wrapped, for up to 2
  weeks; thaw just before serving.) Allow the cookies to warm up
  slightly before serving.
  
  Makes about forty 1 1/4-inch sandwich cookies.

      Title: RASPBERRY-LEMON VERBENA BUTTER
 Categories: Spreads, Fruits, Seasonings
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    1/2 lb Unsalted butter
      4 oz Fresh or frozen raspberries
           -- not in syrup
      1 tb Sugar; or to taste
      1 sm Handful young, tender lemon
           -- verbena leaves
 
  Thaw raspberries if frozen, and pour off any excess liquid.
  
  With all ingredients at room temperature, blend butter, sugar and
  raspberries until smooth.  This may take a while (about three minutes
  in a food processor), and you may think it's never going to emulsify,
  but it will if you persist.  Strip out any large veins in the lemon
  verbena leaves, then add the leaves (chopped if you're mixing by
  hand) and blend until the texture is pleasing.
  
  Alley notes that "this delightfully sweet and fragrant butter is
  excellent on muffins, pancakes or waffles."

      Title: RASPBERRY-TANGERINE MOUSSE
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -==========================
 
  Ingredients:
  
  2 tblsp  unflavored gelatin 4 tblsp cold water juice and grated zest
  of 1 large tangerine 2 pints raspberries (or 20 oz frozen) 2 egg
  yolks 4 tblsp tangerine liqueur (If you can't find this, Grand
  Marnier or Cointreau will do, but use only 2 tsp of them.) 1/2 cup
  granulated sugar 2 cups whipping cream Dissolve gelatin in water. It
  will form a rubbery chunk. Add juice, zest and berries (save a few
  berries for garnish) and heat gently. It should boil, but just
  barely. Stir the whole time. Cook until the rubbery gelatin chunk is
  dissolved.  This will mangle most of the berries; that's ok.  This
  stuff should be a chunky goop at this point. Let it cool.
  
  Beat egg yolks and sugar together.  They should be a pale yellow. Add
  liqueur and mix thoroughly.  Heat over a double boiler until it
  thickens slightly (stirring constantly.) It shouldn't take very long;
  the color will change slightly.  If it's hot all the way through,
  that's good enough. Let it cool.
  
  Mix egg yolk goop and berry goop thoroughly.
  
  Whip cream to soft peaks and fold into the mixture. Chill and serve.
  I like to put it into individual dessert glasses before chilling. Add
  some berries or other fruit as a garnish.

      Title: RASPUTIN'S CODFISH SOUP
 Categories: Russian, Soups
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 sm Whole codfish
           -OR
  1 1/2 lb Codfish fillets
      1 c  Milk
      1 c  Heavy whipping cream
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  This is a toned-down version of the soup that Rasputin always said
  gave him his health, vigor ... and virility. It was, according to his
  daughter, his favorite dish. "Restaurants in Petrograd and Moscow
  would prepare the concoction whenever they expected Rasputin to
  dine." Paprika and minced ginger usually went into his recipe.
  
  Clean codfish. Remove head and cut fish into fillets. Remove fish
  bones. Cut fillets into 2" pieces and place in saucepan. Add milk and
  whipping cream. Place over medium heat and bring to scalding
  temperature. Do not boil.
  
  Reduce heat and continue simmering until fish is done. Season to
  taste with salt and pepper. Ladle into soup bowls and serve hot.
  
  Makes about 1 quart, or 4 servings.

    300 g  Paneer
    175 g  Ricotta cheese
    350 g  Sugar
  1 1/4 l  Water
 
  Rube the *paneer and ricotta cheese with palm of your hand until
  smooth and creamy. Divide into 16 balls.
  
  Boil the sugar and water for 5 minutes over medium heat. Put the
  balls into the syrup and boil for 40 minutes.
  
  Cover and continue to boil for another 30 minutes. Serve warm or cold.
  
  *PANEER (Home-made cottage cheese) 3.5 litres milk about 250ml warm
  water about 5 Tbsp white vinegar
  
  1. Bring the milk to the boil, stirring constantly, over a high heat.
  Remove from heat.
  
  2. Combine the water and vinegar.
  
  3. Slowly add the vinegar solution to the boiled milk, stirring with a
  wooden spoon. As soon as the milk curdles, do not add any more. (The
  curd and whey will separate.)
  
  4. Place three or four layers of cheesecloth in a sieve and strain the
  curdled milk through them. Ties up the ends of the cheesecloth and
  squeeze out as much of the liquid as possible. Hang it up to drain
  thoroughly.
  
  Note: When adding the water and vinegar mixture to the milk, do not
  add more than necessary as this tends to harden the paneer.

 Categories: Sauces, Rubs
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Ketchup
    1/2 c  Prepared chili sauce
    1/4 c  Prepared steak sauce
      3 tb Dry mustard
      2 tb Prepared horseradish
      1 tb Molasses
      1 tb Red wine vinegar
      1 tb Jalapeno pepper -- minced
      1 tb Garlic juice
      1 tb Tabasco sauce
 
  Whisk first 10 ingredients in bowl.  Add hot pepper sauce to taste.
  (Can be prepared up to 1 week in advance. Cover and chill. Bring to
  room temperature to serve.) I have also made a great briskit that I
  got general directions for from my cousin in TX who competes in
  briskit cook-offs. I ate his once and it was fantastic, melted in
  your mouth. I have tried to duplicate it and have come close. Here it
  is:
  
  Mix together apple juice, Italian dressing, liquid smoke and inject
  into briskit (or poke holes in it and marinate in stuff overnight)
  When you smoke it, wrap it in aluminum foil for at least the first
  half of smoking time.  This is the secret to being tender. Unwrap for
  the last hour or two to brown.  Serve with barbecue sauce.

      1 tb Tabasco sauce
      1 tb Molasses
      1 tb Jalapeno salsa (see note)
      1 tb Red wine vinegar
 
  Note:  Most supermarkets carry salsas in varying degrees of hotness.
  For this dish, we recommend using one that packs a substantial wallop.
  
  BARBECUE SAUCE:
      Combine all the ingredients in a medium-size bowl, and whisk
  until the sauce is well blended.  Adjust seasonings to taste.
  
  Makes 3 cups.
  
  RIBS:
      1.  Combine all the braising liquid ingredients in a large pot.
  Stir well, and bring to a simmer over medium heat.
      2.  Add the ribs, and simmer until tender but not falling apart,
  about 1 hour and 45 minutes.  When done, carefully transfer the ribs
  to a baking sheet.
      3.  Combine all the spice mixture ingredients in a medium-size
  bowl, and stir to form a paste.  (Add more beer if it is too dry.)
      4.  Rub the paste over all surfaces of the ribs. Wrap each slab in
  aluminum foil, dull side out, and refrigerate until ready to cook.
  (These can be prepared up to 4 days in advance.)
      5.  Preheat the oven to 400F, and prepare hot coals for grilling.
  Place the rack 3 to 4 inches from the heat.
      6.  Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil and arrange the ribs
  on the foil.  Coat the ribs with 2 cups of the barbecue sauce, and
  bake on the center rack of the oven for 10 minutes.
      7.  Transfer the ribs to the grill, and cook long enough to char.
  Serve immediately, with the remaining 1 cup barbecue sauce on the
  side.
  
        4    portions.
  
  Author's note:  One of America's finest chefs, Jimmy Schmidt -- of the
  Rattlesnake Club in Denver -- has made these one of his signature
  dishes. The three sauces created deep hot flavor -- these are real
  mean western ribs.

  the surface well. When hot, pour in just enough batter to cover the
  bottom of the pan, tilting it from side to side to spread the batter
  to the edges. Brown first on one side and then on the other. Stack 5
  or 6 "ratzelach," sprinkling confectioners' sugar between the layers;
  then cut into wedges for serving. Makes about 15 pancakes. Serves 2-3.

      Title: RAVIOLI FILLED W/PUMPKIN
 Categories: Appetizers, Pasta
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  All purpose flour
      1 c  Semolina flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      4    Room temperature egg
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Warm water
     10 oz Solid pack pumpkin
    1/2 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
           -cheese
      6    Single amaretto
      2    Egg
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Freshly ground white pepper
    1/4 ts Fresh grated nutmeg
      2 tb Olive oil
    3/4 c  Clarified unsalted butter
 
  For pasta: Combine flours and 1/2 teaspoon salt in processor. Add 4
  eggs, 2 tablespoons olive oil and water and blend until dough comes
  together, about 20 seconds. Turn dough out onto lightly floured
  surface and knead until smooth, about 3 minutes. Wrap in plastic. Let
  stand 15 minutes.
  
  For filling: Blend next 7 ingredients in processor. Set mixture aside.
  
  To assemble: Cut dough into 6 pieces. Flatten 1 piece of dough (keep
  remainder covered to prevent drying), then fold into thirds. Turn
  pasta machine to widest setting and run dough through. Repeat until
  dough is smooth and velvety, folding before each run and dusting with
  flour if sticky. Adjust pasta machine to next narrower setting. Run
  dough through without folding. Repeat, narrowing rollers after each
  run until pasta is about 1/16 inch thick, dusting with flour if
  sticky. Repeat with another piece of dough. Lay 1 dough sheet on
  lightly floured surface. Mound level teaspoons of filling at 2-inch
  intervals, leaving 1/2-inch border along edges. Brush dough between
  filling and along edges with water. Top with second sheet, pressing
  around filling to seal. Trim around filling using pastry cutter to
  create ravioli. Arrange ravioli on lightly floured waxed paper.
  Repeat with remaining dough. Let ravioli dry until leathery around
  edges. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead and refrigerated.)
  
  Stir 2 tablespoons olive oil into large pot of boiling salted water.
  Add ravioli (in batches if necessary) and cook until just tender but
  firm to bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well. Transfer to bowl. Add
  butter and toss well. Divide among 8 plates. Sprinkle each with
  freshly grated Parmesan cheese if desired. Top with freshly ground
  pepper.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
           FOR DOUGH
      8 oz Plain flour, sifted
           Pinch of salt
  2 1/2 oz Caster sugar
  4 1/2 oz Butter, diced
      1    Egg
    1/2 ts Finely grated lemon zest
           FOR FILLING
      3 fl Hot weak China tea
     12 oz Caster sugar
      6    No need to soak prunes
      1 lb Apples
      2 oz Pine nut kernels
           Icing sugar to dust
           TO SERVE
           Whipped cream or vanilla
           Ice cream.
 
  To make the dough, put the flour, salt and sugar in a food processor
  and, with the machine running at full speed, add the butter until
  incorporated. Then add the egg and lemon zest and process for a few
  seconds until a soft dough has formed. Scrape the dough onto a sheet
  of clingfilm, then form into a cylinder and chill for at least 1
  hour. To make the filling, sweeten the tea with 2 tspn sugar and soak
  the prunes in it. Peel, core and slice the apples. Put the rest of
  the sugar in a large pan with 2 tbsp water. Heat gently, stirring
  occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved. Add the apple slices.
  Increase the heat to medium and cook, without stirring, until the
  apples are candied (approx. 20 mins). Most of the liquid will
  evaporate leaving a thick syrup. Drain and chop the prunes and add to
  the pan with the pine nut kernels. Remove from the heat, cool
  slightly then transfer to a bowl and leave to cool. Preheat the oven
  to 180'C (350'F). To assemble the ravioli, cut a slice off the end of
  the dough cylinder and roll out on a floured surface. Use a 3 inch
  cutter to cut out a neat circle. Repeat using the rest of the dough
  to make approx. 20 circles. Place a small spoonful of the filling on
  each circle. Brush the edges with a little water and fold over to
  make a half circle. Crimp the edges to seal firmly. Place all the
  ravioli on a greased baking sheet and bake for 10-15 minutes or until
  light golden. Cool slightly and dust with icing sugar and serve with
  cream or ice cream.

  until smooth and elastic. (Use shorter time if you are using a pasta
  machine to roll the dough.) RICOTTA FILLING Combine in a large bowl
  all filling ingredients. ASSEMBLY Divide dough into fourths. Lightly
  roll each portion 1/8 inch thick and cut lengthwise into 5 inch wide
  strips. Use the strips immediately--do nt allow to dry. Place 2
  teaspoons of the filling 1 1/2 inches from the narrow end and in the
  center of the strip. Continue along the strip, placing the filling at
  about 3 1/2 inch intervals. Fold the strip in half lengthwise,
  covering the mounds of filling.  To seal, press the edges together

      Title: RAW FISH SALAD (JAPANESE SASHIMI)
 Categories: Japanese, Seafood
      Yield: 9 Servings
 
      1 lb Bass (raw) or:
           - Tuna (raw) or: other
           - fish of your choice, fresh
           - water or salt, bones and
           - skin removed and slivered
    1/2 c  Gingerroot, fresh, chopped
           -or: 1/4 c powdered ginger
    1/2 c  Horseradish, grated
    1/2 c  Mustard sauce or: 1/4 c
           - mustard powder
           Water, for mixing sauce
           - ingredients
           Bowl of very fresh salad
           - greens, broken or cut into
           - small pieces
 
  In this popular dish, the Japanese enjoy eating their fish completely
  raw, cut in slivers about 1/4 inch thick, and dipped into a mixture
  of fresh chopped gingerroot, grated horseradish and mustard. We add
  dishes of very fresh greens, turning the Sashimi into a salad.
  
  If your fish is very, very fresh, your dishes colorful and
  attractively arranged, and if you accompany your first bite of raw
  fish with a generous mouthful of crisp greens, you will probably be
  able to overcome your prejudices and discover what the Japanese have
  known for centuries: fish doesn't have to be cooked to taste good.
  
  INSTRUCTIONS: Set out the slivered fish, 3 dishes of seasonings and
  salad greens and let everyone mix his own sauce, tasting and testing
  as he does, and help himself to greens.

      Title: RAW GLUTEN
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      7 c  Whole wheat bread flour
      3 c  ;water
 
   Pour the water into a large bowl. Add about 3 cups of the flour and
  mix well. Beatthe dough for about 100 strokes, or until it becomes
  elastic. Gradually add enough of the remaining flour to make a
  kneadable dough.
  
   Turn the dough out onto agenerously floured surface and knead in
  enough flour to make a firm and nonsticky dough. Knead the dough
  vigorously for 20 minutes. If kneading becomes too difficult for you,
  try pounding the dough with a rolling pin or with your fists.
  
   Continue kneading and/or pounding the dough until it becomes very
  smooth and elastic. To make sure that the dough is kneaded enough,
  break off a small piece and wash it. If it is sufficiently kneaded,
  the starch will wash away, leaving the elastic gluten.
  
   The next step is washing or rinsing the dough. Fill a large bowl with
  room-temperature water (use the same bowl you used to mix the dough).
  Place the bowl in the sink and place the dough in the bowl. Work the
  dough by rubbing it and sqsueezing it between your hands with a
  motion similar to that of washing clothes.
   Don't worry if the dough falls apart, because it will come back
  together as it is washed.
  
   When the water becomes very cloudy, pour (with the dough) through a
  colander. If you want to save the starch water, place an empty bowl
  under the colander to catch it. Repeat this squeezing and rinsing
  process until the rinse water is practically clear and the dough
  resembles a large, elastic wad of chewing gum.
   You now have raw gluten.
  
   Use the raw gluten to make seitan.

  Wash and drain the bulgur. Grate the onions, chop the parsley and mix
  them together. Skin and dice the tomatoes and add to the onions and
  parsley. Put the salt, black pepper, red pepper, allspice and cumin
  into the mixture, and blend by mixing with the hand a couple of times
  and set aside. Put the meat and bulgur on a large tray and make into
  a apste by kneading. Moisten hands with cold water occasionally while
  kneading. Add the prepared mixture of onion, tomatoes and spices to
  the meat and knead to make a paste. Take small pieces of the mixture
  and press with the palm to flatten it, and put on a serving plate.
  Decorate with lettuce and parsley before serving. It is recommended
  that you prepare raw meatballs just before serving, because if they
  are allowed to stand for a long time, the taste is spoiled.

      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      2 lb Chuck beef, cubed in
           -stew-sized pieces
      1 md Onion, chopped
      2 tb Chopped suet or veg. oil
      4    Jalapenos, stemmed,
           -seeded, halved
      8 oz Tomato sauce
     12 oz Beer
     16 oz Beef stock
      1 tb Cumin, ground
      2 ts Garlic powder
      1 ts Pepper, ground
      4 tb Chili powder
    1/4 c  Masa
      1 c  Water
      1 tb Paprika
 
  The only way I do beer chili is make a regular pot, extra hot, and
  drink a bunch of beers with it. Very satisfactory that way.
  
  Let it be noted that I disagree with many of the particulars of the
  recipe below, but it's a good example of a beer chili.
  
  Brown beef and onion in fat. Add peppers, tomato, beer, stock, cumin,
  garlic, pepper, and half the chili powder. Simmer until meat is done,
  about 2 hr. Make a paste of the masa and water. Stir this quickly
  into the chili. Add the paprika and the rest of the chili powder.
  Cook 15 min. Remove Jalapenos and serve.

      4    Egg yolks
    1/4 c  Superfine sugar
      2 tb Cognac
      6 oz Semi--sweet chocolate, cut
           -into small chumnks

    1/2 c  Heavy cream, whipped
 
  Real French Chocolate Mousse
  
  French Chocolate Mousse
  
  Brush the inside of a 1 quart charlotte (cylindrical) or ring mold
  with a film of veg. oil. Invert the mold on paper towels to drain. In
  a heatproof mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar with a whisk,
  rotary or electric beater for 2 or 3 minutes, or until they are pale
  yellow and thick enough to form a ribbon when the whisk is lifted
  from the bowl. Beat in the cognac. Set the mixing bowl over a pan of
  barely simmering (not boiling) water, and continue beating for 3 or 4
  minutes, or until the mixture is foamy and hot. Then set the bowl
  over a pan of iced water and beat for 3 or 4 minutes longer, or until
  the mixture is cool again and as thick and creamy as mayonaise. In a
  heavy 4 to 6 cup saucepan, melt the chocolate with the coffee over
  hot water, stirring constantly. When all of the chocolate has
  dissolved, beat in the butter--one piece at a time--to make a smooth
  cream. Then beat the chocolate mixture into the egg yolks and sugar.
  In a seperate bowl, with a clean whisk or beater, beat the egg whites
  until they are stiff enough to form stiff peaks on the wires of the
  whisk. Stir about 1/4 of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture to
  lighten it, then very gently fold in the remaining egg whites. Spoon
  the mousse into the oiled mold or dessert cups and refrigerate for at
  least four hours or until it has set. To unmold and serve, run a long
  sharp knife around the sides of the mold and dip the bottom of it in
  hot water for a few seconds. Then wipe the outside of the mold dry,
  place a chilled serving plate upside down over the mold and, grasping
  both sides firmly, quickly turn the plate and mold over.  Rap the
  plate on a table and the mousse should slide easily out of the mold.
  If the mousse doesn't unmold at once, repeat the whole process. With
  a wire whisk, rotary or electric beater, whip the chilled cream in a
  large chilled bowl until it is firm enough to hold its shape softly.
  Garnish the mousse with the whipped cream.
