Baileys Ice Cream

deserts, ice cream

2 cup double cream
1 cup full fat milk
1 cup castor sugar
1/2 cup baileys
1 pinch salt

Whisk all of this stuff together until all the sugar has been
dissolved.

Then freeze as you would normally freeze ice cream, either in an ice
cream maker or in a tub in the freezer whisking every half hour or so.

Because of the alcohol content of this ice cream it will usually take
around 12 hours to become hard.  It does freeze hard so taking it out
the freezer 10 minutes before serving is advised.  It does melt
quickly so you have to eat it fast.

Don't put any more Baileys into the mix.  1/2 a cup may not seem much
but the flavour comes through very strongly.

I prefer this with a little Baileys poured over it.

Make it and enjoy it.  That is an order!

Preheat oven to 350 F after the filling has been prepared.

Divide the pastry into 2-equal parts.  Lay 1 sheet on a well-buttered
11 x 16 inch baking pan.  Brush surface generously with melted
butter. Lay second sheet on top of first and butter. Repeat until
half of the pastry sheets have been used.

Cover unused half of pastry sheets with a kitchen cloth to prevent
drying.

Prepare the filling:  Over medium heat bring milk, sugar and salt to
a boil in a saucepan.  Add farina by sprinkling in a little at a
time, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens and the farina
is well cooked.

Spread the hot farina mixture evenly over the entire surface of pastry
sheets.  Again build up the remaining half of the pastry sheets,
buttering each surface generously, on top of farina. Pour the
remaining butter over the top.  Cut pastry sheets into 24 equal
squares. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until light golden.

While the baklava is cooking prepare syrup:  Place sugar, water, and
lemon juice in a saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring
constantly, until sugar is dissolved. Bring to a boil and simer for
15 minutes without stirring.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.

Remove baklava from oven.  Pour off all excess butter by tilting the
pan. Cook for 10 minutes.  Brush surface lightly with some of the
drained butter to give luster to the pastry. Pour syrup over a little
at a time, until all is absorbed.  Allow to cool for several hours.

Banana Pudding With Mandarine Cream

deserts, ice cream, bananas

1 stephen ceideburg
4 large bananas
200 gm caster sugar
6 tablespoon mandarine juice
3 tablespoon white rum
4  eggs, separated
1 pinch salt
3 tablespoon sugar
210 ml mandarine juice

Loosely related to a dessert from the English-speaking islands of the
West Indies, this makes a wonderful - and legal - winter fruit
pudding. Despite its richness, it has next to no fat and, if you use
eggs modified with omega 3 oil, it couldn't be more nutritionally
sound.

Mash 4 large bananas (if anything, slightly overripe) with 200 g
caster sugar, 6 tablespoons mandarin juice and 3 tablespoons white
rum. Separate 4 eggs and beat the whites with a pinch of salt until
they stand in stiff peaks. Fold the whites through the banana mixture
gently and turn the mixture into a serving dish or dishes. Chill for
several hours until set.

Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks with 3 tablespoons of sugar until thick
and creamy. Tip the mixture into the top of a double boiler or a
basin over simmering water, add 210 mL of mandarine juice and whisk
over a gentle heat until it reaches coating consistency. Don't let it
boil. Chill for several hours. Serve with the pudding.

fruit into a mixing bowl, add the lemon juice, and mash until the
fruit is purred. Drain the juice into another bowl and reserve. Cover
the melon puree and refrigerate. Prepare the sweet cream base and
whisk in the fruit juice. Transfer the mixture to an ice cream maker

cream stiffens, about 2 minutes before it is done, add the
cantaloupe. if more juice has accumulated, do not pour it in because
it will water down the ice cream. Continue freezing until the ice
cream is ready. Makes 1 generous quart.

it does not store well in home freezers, so be prepared to eat it
all!! Pour the cream into a mixing bowl. Whisk in the sugar, a little
at a time, then continue whisking until completely blended, about 1
minute more. Pour the half and half and whisk to blend. Makes 1 quart.

Caramel Cage Covers For Ice Cream (Kh)

deserts, ice cream

1/2 cup water
1 cup sugar
1 pinch cream of tartar
1  aluminum foil
6 oz ladle
1  vegetable oil
1  candy thermometer

Cover the outside (rounded part) of a 6 oz ladle with aluminum foil.
Making sure to keep the surface smooth and tight. Lightly oil the
domed surface of foil.

Now pour into a saucepan the sugar, water and cream of tartar. Shake
the pan to mix and cover. Heat this covered mixture over medium low
heat until the sugar dissolves. Remove lid and continue cooking the
syrp until it turns a light gold color (about 340 degrees F. on candy
thermometer).

Remove the pan from the heat and let sit at room temperature for 6-8
minutes. The syrup will turn a darker gold color.

Now you are ready to make the cages. Just hold the foil covered ladle
over the pan, dip a spoon into the caramel mixture and drizzle over
ladle, moving you hand around in a swirling motion to form a wed or
lattice pattern on the foil. Prop up the ladle so the caramel cage
cools completely (about 10 minutes).

Pry foil away from the ladle carefully so as not to break the fragile
cage. Trim away the uneven strands with scissors to form a nice
straight bottom. Now carefully peel off the foil and you have a
beautiful candy cage to place over a single scoop of ice cream. Try
to find a dish so the cage fits on the edge of the dish. Instruct
your guests to tap the cage with the back of a spoon and enjoy the
special effect.

1 1/2 quart whole milk
1/3 cup sugar
3/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
8  paper cups or
1  cooking parchment or
1  waxed paper
8  ice cream sticks (opt)

25-35 minutes, stirring often; slide pan partially off heat if milk
threaten to boil over. Let cool; to speed cooling, set pan in ice
water.

Set paper cups in a rimmed pan. Or, to make cones, cut 8 pieces of
parchment or waxed paper into 7-1/2" squares. Fold each piece in half
to make a triangle. With long edge toward you, bring 1 of the 45'
angles to the top of the triangle, then roll toward other angle. To
close hole at bottom, starting from the top, press 1 inside sheet to
tyhe opposite side. Tape the cone in a few places to hold it
together. Support each cone, pointed end down, in a cup slightly
taller than the cone; set cups in a rimmed pan.

Divide milk mixture among cups or cones. Freeze until kulfi is thick
but not hard, 1 to 1-1/2 hours; then, if desired, push an ice cream
stick into each container. Freeze until firm, about 2 hours longer.
To eat, peel off paper. To store, seal kjulfi (still in cups or
cones) in a parge plastic bag; freeze for up to 2 weeks.

liquid into the egg yolks, then whisk the yolks into the cream
mixture. Continue stirring over very low heat, never allowing the
mixture to boil, until the custard thickens, about 8-10 minutes.

Pour the custard into another container and allow it to cook, then
chill it. Remove the cinnamon sticks, strain the custard if needed,
and freeze it in an ice cream freezer accoridng to manufacturer's
instructions.

is crumbly.
3.Spread evenly on a baking sheet, and bake 5 minutes. Stir several
times while baking, watching to be sure the topping does not burn.
Cool, then break up any large clumps that may have formed. -----

Clotted Cream Part 1

deserts, ice cream

1 x no ingredients

Clotted cream is a traditional product of South West England and
the traditional farmhouse method of manufacture is as follows:

1.  Channel Island milk is placed in shallow pans or bowls and left
until the cream rises to the top.

2.  The milk is then scalded for about one hour by placing the pan or
bowl over a pan of water maintained at a temperature of about 180^F
(82^C).

3.  The cream is ready when it is straw colored and wrinkled in
appearance. It is then cooled overnight or for about twelve hours.

4.  When cool the cream should be skimmed off the surface using a
perforated skimmer or a shallow spoon.

5.  If the skimmed cream is left in the refrigerator for a few hours
it will thicken further.

Alternatively, clotted cream can be made using the direct scald
method. Double cream is placed in shallow pans or bowls and scalded
as for the traditional method. After scalding and cooling the whole
contents of the pan are used as clotted cream.

Clotted Cream Part 2

deserts, ice cream

20 oz heavy whipping cream
2 quart milk (or more)*

*Preferably extra-rich milk, if you can get it in your area.

Choose a wide-mouthed bowl or stainless steel bowl with sloping
sides. Fill it with milk, leaving a deep enough rim free to avoid
spillage. Add 20 fl double cream. Leave in the refrigerator for at
least several hours, and preferably overnight.  Set the bowl over a
pan of water kept at 82 degrees C (180 F) and leave until the top of
the milk is crusted with a nubbly yellowish-cream surface.  This will
take at least 1 1/2 hours, but it is prudent to allow much longer.
Take the bowl from the pan and cool it rapidly in a bowl of ice
water, then store in the refrigerator until very cold.  Take the
crust off with a skimmer, and put it into another bowl with a certain
amount of the creamy liquid underneath; it is surprising how much the
clotted part firms up--it needs the liquid. You can now put the milk
back over the heat for a second crust to form, and add that in its
turn to the first one. The milk left over makes the most delicious
rice pudding, or can be used in baking, especially of yeast buns.

Cloutie Dumpling With Ginger Cream

deserts, ice cream

      ----THE DUMPLING----
1 lb self-raising flour
6 oz fresh brown breadcrumbs
4 oz soft brown sugar
1 teaspoon mixed spice
1  a little extra cinnamon
5 oz vegetable fat or butter
1 tablespoon black treacle
2  apples  cored, unpeeled, grated
1  carrot; grated
8 oz currants
8 oz sultanas
1  egg
1/4 pint milk
1  18 sq. clean cotton sheet
      ----GINGER CREAM----
8 oz crabbe's green ginger wine
3  egg yolks
1/4 pint single cream

Sieve the flour and mix it with the breadcrumbs, brown sugar and
spices. Melt the butter or vegetable fat gently with the treacle. Mix
the breadcrumbs, currants and sultanas. Beat the egg and milk
together and add to the dry ingredients, with the grated carrot and
apple - use you hands. Add more milk if necessary to give a soft
mixture which drops easily from the spoon. Put a square of cotton
sheet in the pot of boiling water with an upturned plate on the
bottom. Take out the scalded cloth, spinkle it with flour and put in
the dumpling. Draw up the edges, and tie up firmly with white string,
leaving enough room for the pudding to expand. Lower the dumpling
back into the boiling pan. Keep water topped up. Bring back to the
boil. Boil steadily but gently for 4 hours. It can be longer but it
shouldn't be less. Remove the dumpling and dip it staight in and out
of cold water.  Unwrap the dumpling on to a serving plate. The skin
will initially be white from the flour. Put the dumpling on its plate
in a very low oven to dry off for 20 minutes, when it will develop a
fine, dark glossy skin. Meanwhile, make the ginger cream. Beat the
wine with the egg yolks over hot water until the mixture is thick,
white and fluffy. Stir in 1/4 pint single cream. Serve it in a pretty
glass jug, with the hot pudding. The dumpling cuts wonderfully rich
and dark. Leftover slices are delicious fried in butter - lovely with
cream for a special tea-time treat.

Coconut Ice

deserts, ice cream, vegatarian, vegetarian, ice

450 gm granulated sugar
150 ml water
1 teaspoon vanilla essence
100 gm desiccated coconut
1  red vegetable colouring

First line an 18 cm (7 inch) square tin with nonstick paper.

Put the granulated sugar and water into a medium-sized, heavy-based
saucepan and heat gently, without boiling, until the sugar has
dissolved.

Bring to the boil and let it simmer steadily until the temperature
reaches 120 C (240 F) on a sugar thermometer, or a little of the
syrup dropped into a cup of cold water forms a soft ball. Remove from
the heat immediately and add the vanilla essence and dessicated
coconut.

Stir the mixture for 5-10 minutes, or until it begins to thicken and
set, then pour half of it into the prepared tin and smooth it level.
Colour the remaining half pale pink with a drop or two of the
colouring, then pour this on top of the white coconut ice, spreading
it to the edges and making sure it's level. Press it all down quite
firmly with the back of a spoon, and leave it to harden.

Turn the coconut ice out and cut it into squares using a sharp knife.

Coconut Ice Cream

deserts, ice cream

5 cup grated fresh coconut *
1 cup sugar
3 cup milk
5  egg yolks

1.  Put the grated coconut in a saucepan and add the sugar and milk.
Bring to the boil and cook about 5 minutes.  Let cool. 2. Strain
the liquid through a piece of cheesecloth and squeeze the
coconut meat to extract as much liquid as possible. Reserve 2
cups of the grated meat and discard the rest or put it to another
use. 3. Put the egg yolks in a mixing bowl and beat with a whisk.
Beat
in the sweetened liquid and scrape the mixture into a saucepan
and heat.  Use a wooden spoon and stir constantly, this way and
that, making certain that the spoon touches all over the bottom
of the saucepan.  Cook until the mixture has a custard-like
consistency and coats the sides of the spoon (180 degrees). Do
not let the sauce boil, or it will curdle.  This cooking will rid
the custard of the raw taste of the yolks. 4. Immediately remove
the sauce from the heat and continue stirring.
Set the saucepan in a basin of cold water to reduce the
temperature.  Let the sauce cool to room temperature. 5. Pour the
custard into the container of an electric or hand-
cranked ice cream maker.  Partly freeze according to the
manufacturer's instructions.  Add the reserved 2 cups of coconut
pulp and continue freezing until solid.

* GRATED FRESH COCONUT

Use 1 or 2 coconuts.  It is best to use 2 in case 1 isn't sweet
enough. Select large coconuts that are heavy and contain a lot of
liquid. You can determine the amount of liquid when you shake the
coconut.

Pierce the "eyes" of the coconut with an ice pick. Crack the shell of
the coconut in several places, using a hammer or hatchet.

Pry out the flesh with a blunt knife.  Pare away the dark skin. Grate
the coconut using the coarse blade of a grater or a food processor.

Coconut Milk Ice Cream

deserts, ice cream

1 cup sugar
2 large eggs
4 cup canned coconut milk

1.  In a bowl beat together the sugar and eggs until pale in color,
about 5 minutes.  Beat in the coconut milk.

2.  Freeze in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's
instructions.  Serve right away or store in the freezer.

TIPS:  You may need to allow extra time for hardening in the freezer
if your ice cream maker turns out a soft ice cream. You can
substitute any good-quality ice cream if you don't have the time and
equipment to make the ice creams called for.

Pulverised dried saffron strands

Shortcrust pastry made with 225 g/8 oz flour, 65 g/2 1/2 oz butter,
40 g/1 1/2 oz lard, and cold water to mix

6 egg yolks 350 ml/12 fl oz/ 1 1/2 cups double cream 125 ml/4 fl oz/
1/2 cup milk 65 g/2 1/2 oz white sugar
1/4    teaspoon sea salt

I first noticed this version of the old recipe in The Babees Book,
and it seemed just right as a sweet dish for the youngsters being
taught from that book.  There is a richer version made with almond
milk for fast days outside Lent.

Soak the saffron in 2 tablespoons water until the water is deep gold
in colour.  Use the pastry to make a case 5 cm/2 inches deep in a
20-cm/8-inch pie plate or cake tin with a loose bottom. Bake 'blind'
in a pre-heated oven at 200C/400F/Gas Mark 6 for 15-20 minutes, then
remove the filling of dried beans and return the case to the oven at
about 160C/325F/Gas Mark 3 for 6-8 minutes until dried out and firm.
Remember a cake tin is deeper than a pie plate so the case in it may
need longer baking than usual.

Beat the egg yolks lightly in a bowl, then beat in the cream, milk,
sugar, saffron water and salt.  Pour the custard into the pastry
case. Bake it at 160C/325F/Gas Mark 3 for about 45 minutes or until
it is just set in the centre.  Serve warm.

Make small tarts if you prefer.  The full recipe quantity of pastry
will make 36 tarts, using a 7.5 cm/3 inch cutter. You will need two
thirds of the filling for them.

Cream Puffs Iii

deserts, ice cream

1 cup water
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
6  eggs

1.  Preheat oven to 400F. 2. Put the water and butter in a medium
saucepan, and set over medium-
high heat.  Adjust the heat so that the butter is melted about the
same time as the water begins to boil.  Off the heat, add the flour
all at once and stir until blended.  Over medium-high heat, beat
the mixture until it forms a mass around the spoon and a film begins
to form on the bottom and sides of the pan.  This indicates the
flour is cooked. 3. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after
each addition.  You
can use an electric mixer for this.  The batter should be shiny
and fall slightly from a spoon when lifted. 4. Using a pastry bag
fitted with a 1/2" plain tip (or a spoon), form
3 to 4 inch mounds of dough on a greased cookie sheet, leaving 2
inches between each.  Bake for 15 minutes.  Lower the oven to 350F
and bake another 10 minutes, or until the puffs are browned and dry
looking.  Let cool on the sheet. 5. When cool, cut the tops off the
puffs and carefully pull out any
uncooked parts from the inside.  Place tops back on the cream puffs.
At this point, the puffs can be used immediately or frozen for later
use. ~--

Cream-Corn Pudding

deserts, ice cream, breakfast

1 can cream-style corn
1/2 cup sugar
1 cup milk
2  eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 tablespoon butter (optional)

In a large, oven-proof mixing bowl, combine all ingredients except
butter; beat well together.  Top with butter if desired. Bake at
350-f 35 min, or until set.

Note:  I would advise _NOT_ trying this in the microwave; I have
attempted an MW method, and the mixture did not set.

Variations: Before baking, stir in a heaping tablespoon of raisins,
currants, or berries. For the last ten minutes of baking, top with
fine graham wafer or cornflake crumbs. For a delicious and hearty
breakfast, place banana slices in the bottom of a soup bowl, and
spoon leftover pudding over top.  Microwave until heated through; add
a little milk if desired. The pudding will keep in the refrigerator
for at least a week.

Creamy Toffee Sauce :)

deserts, ice cream

200 gm can evaporated milk
1  unopened!

Easy to make creamy toffee sauce....

Boil the unopened can of condensed milk for 3 hours remembering to
keep the water in the pan topped up. Leave to cool before using. When
you open the can, you will have a rich creamy home made toffee that
goes so well in other recipes - with ice cream, as a sauce or as a
sweet spread. From Ron's Plaice in Blackpool:)

Creme Aux Bimbrelles (Blueberry Cream)

deserts, ice cream, french

1  text only

Always thought that Irma la Douce was a bimbrelle. Imagine my
surprise when I found out a bimbrelle is a type of huckleberry...

From the Lorraine region in northern France, this traditional recipe
utilises a variety of huckleberry called bimbrelle which grows wild
in the forests of the Vosges. However, it is, if anything, better
made with cultivated blueberries.

Put 750 g of blueberries into a saucepan and reduce to 1 cup or so of
very thick puree.  Strain the puree, then add 175 g sugar and the
juice of a lemon.  Stir well to dissolve.

Melt 7 g gelatine in a tablespoon or so of water in a double boiler
over simmering water.  Add the gelatine to the berry puree, then add
200 fresh, whole blueberries. Refrigerate, keeping a close eye on the
mixture, and meanwhile whip 250 mL cream till barely mounding. As
soon as the gelatin shows signs of setting, fold in the cream then
turn the mixture into an oiled mould and refrigerate at least 4 hours.

Serve with more lightly whipped cream, sweetened and flavoured with 1
tablespoon of cognac.

Makes 6 servings.

Creme De Abacate - Avocado Cream

deserts, ice cream

1  stephen ceideburg
2 large avocados
1  juice of 1 lime
1  zest of 1 lime
3 tablespoon lime juice
4 tablespoon caster sugar

This Brazilian dessert is particularly simple to make so it can be
prepared just before serving - which is just as well as it prevents
any problem with the surface darkening.

Grate the zest of 1 lime and juice 1 or more limes to obtain 3
tablespoons juice (this can be done ahead of time). Halve 2 large
avocados, scoop the flesh into a food processor or blender, add 3
tablespoons of lime juice and 4 tablespoons of caster sugar. Process
till smooth. Pile the cream into serving dishes and scatter lime zest
over the top.

Crepes Suzette From Ron' Plaice In Blackpool:)

deserts, ice cream

4 7/16 oz flour
1 7/16 oz sugar, icing/confectioners
1/2  lemon, rind, grated
2  egg yolks
1  egg whole
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup cream, single
1 3/4 oz butter
1  butter for cooking
3  oranges
1  lemon
1 1/16 oz sugar, regular kind:)
2 2/3 tablespoon grand marnier or similar
1/4 cup brandy
10  sugar lumps

This dish, above all others, evokes that French 'feeling' in foreign
restaurants.  Easy to cook once you get the batter just right. The
Grand Marnier can be substituted with any suitable orange flavored
liqueur. Delicious made with Southern Comfort. An 'adult' dessert for
a special occasion.  Bon appetite mon cherie! From Ron's Plaice in
Blackpool for a sweet lady in the USA ;-)

The Crepe: [Pancake] Mix the flour with the icing/confectioner sugar
and grated rind of half a lemon in a bowl. Beat the egg yolks and egg
with the milk and cream, and stir into the flour. Beat all to a
smooth batter. Melt the butter and stir into batter mix. Cook in a
very hot pan with a little of the butter for cooking. Each crepe
should be very thin and about 6 inches across. Keep hot!

The Sauce: Wash and dry the oranges and lemons. Rub the sugar lumps
over the rind to extract the wonderful aromatic oils. [I can almost
smell it from here:)] Squeeze the fruits to extract the juice.  Heat
some butter in a large pan,add the sugar lumps and sugar [regular
type as used in coffee]. Once melted, add the orange and lemon juice,
and cook for a few minutes. While stirring, add the Grand Marnier.
Heat the crepes, one by one in the sauce,turning several times;
almost all the sauce should be absorbed by the crepes.  Roll up all
crepes and return to the pan. Warm the brandy, pour it over the
crepes in the pan, set it alight 'Whooof'! Flambe by leaving the
crepes in the pan until the flames die down. Serve at once. Once
consumed, you should turn down the lights, 'snuggle' up on the
settee, and discuss the merits of French Cuisine in whispers. Bon
appetite :-) From Ron's Place in Blackpool, just a whisper from your
heart :-)

Crockpot Rice Pudding With Fruit

fruits, deserts, ice cream, crockpot

1/2 gal milk; * see note
1 cup rice
1 cup sugar
3 tablespoon margarine; solid
1/4 teaspoon salt; optional
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup dried apricots or peaches; m
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

and half whole milk, or all nonfat for lower fat content.

Substitute canned milk for the regular milk for a very rich
flavor. The cooking time will vary greatly, anywhere from 1-1/2 to
3-1/2 hours. The longer it cooks the thicker it will be.
It is important to have the dried apricots minced. Put all
ingredients into crockpot. Stir to blend well. Cover and cook on high
1- 1/2 hours, stir once after about 1 hour. Or, cook on high for the
first 30 minutes, turn to low and cook as long as you desire. Check
after the first 2 hours of low cooking and stir. If rice is not
absorbing the milk quickly enough, turn the crockpot up to high
again. Keep cover on at all times.

Crockpot temperatures vary widely among different brands. Only
experimentation can tell you the correct amount of time for cooking
in your crockpot. Rarely will a crockpot recipe fail, though, as the
long, slow cooking process does not require precise timing.

Custard Apple Cream

deserts, ice cream

1  stephen ceideburg
3 teaspoon gelatine
1/3 cup boiling water
500 gm cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup caster sugar
190 ml cream
2 large custard apples

This dessert is related to cheesecake but while it has the latter's
richness, it is much more subtle. Because of that subtlety, it is
difficult to decorate in any way. At most, you could try some shaved
curls of white chocolate, but it is at its best with no more than a
thin topping of completely plain pouring cream.

Dissolve 3 teaspoons of gelatine in one third of a cup of boiling
water. Beat 500 grams of softened cream cheese thorough- ly, then add
the gelatine mixture, half a cup of caster sugar, 190 mL cream and
the pureed flesh of 2 fairly large custard apples. Beat until smooth
then pour into 8 dessert glasses or pots.

Refrigerate for 2-3 hours.

200 ml cream
100 gm caster sugar

Delicate in flavour, this ice-cream originates in the Caribbean. It

Puree 400 mL of custard apple flesh (you will need 2 medium to large
custard apples). Add 200 mL cream and 100 g caster sugar Stir well
then stir again from time to time until the sugar has dissolved. Pour
into an ice-cream maker and freeze. Or if you don't own this
appliance, pour the mixture into a metal freezing tray(s) and freeze,
stirring with a fork from time to time as an icy mush forms at the
edges.

When the whole mixture is a mush remove from the fridge, beat well and
freeze again until required. Soften in the body of the fridge for
15-20 minutes before serving.

Delice Aux Noisettes

deserts, ice cream, nuts

1  10-in prebaked quiche shell
1 1/2 cup hazelnuts
1 1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 pinch cream of tartar
1 1/2 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
1/2 tablespoon vanilla
2 large eggs

PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F. Whip 1/2 cup of the cream in a chilled bowl or
over ice till soft peaks form, then add the confectioners' sugar and
vanilla and beat just to stiff peaks. Place in strainer lined with
cheesecloth and set over a bowl. Place the hazelnuts on a tray in the
oven for about 10 minutes. Do not let them burn. Take them out and
skin them. Keep 1/2 cup of the nuts warm. In a stainless steel or
aluminum saucepan, heat 1/2 cup of the sugar and 3 tablespoons of
water to boiling. Add a pinch of cream of tartar and continue cooking
to a light brown color. Lightly oil a baking sheet with 1 to 2
tablespoons of oil. When the syrup is a light brown, pour the 1/2 cup
of warmed nuts into it and stir with a wooden spoon to coat the nuts
evenly. Immediately pour them out onto the oiled baking sheet. Let
cool, 10 minutes, to make nougatine. Grind the remaining 1 cup nuts
with 3/4 cup of the sugar in a food processor to form nut butter.
This will take from 6 to 10 minutes. The food processor may have to
be scraped down from time to time, but the oils must emerge and it
must be somewhat like a peanut butter. When the nougatine is cooled
and hardened, chop it coarsely with a knife into pieces small enough
to eat. Mix 1 cup of cream and the eggs together, add to nut butter
and pour into a quiche shell. Sprinkle the nougatine over the top.
Bake 25 to 35 minutes until browned and set. Serve the quiche tepid
with dollops of whipped cream placed on the top with a tablespoon. Or
decorate with whipped cream piped through a pastry bag.

Serve hot, warm or cold with a mixture of the cinnamon and remaining
sugar sprinkled lightly and evenly over the top.

MARGIE'S NOTES: As printed the pudding comes out very sweet, and with
too many raisins for my taste. So I change the rice from 1/2 cup to 1
cup, and change the water to 2 cups. This of course changes the
servings to more, but with Gary around, it all goes anyway.

Dondurma Cilekli (Strawberry Water Ice)

deserts, ice cream, turkish

1  text only

This simple little Turkish ice can be served as a dessert or as a
palate-cleansing between-courses Sorbet. You don't need an ice-cream
machine to make it.

In a saucepan, make a syrup with 2 cups water and 1 cup sugar. Stir
over heat until the sugar dissolves, then add the juice of half a
lemon and boil the syrup vigorously for 5 minutes. Set aside to cool.

In a food processor, puree 3 punnets of hulled, strawberries with
quarter of a cup of milk and a couple of drops of red food colouring.
Combine puree with the syrup and pour into a narrow rectangular cake
tin or a freezer tray and freeze.

To serve, break up the strawberry ice with a fork and spoon it into
chilled dishes or glasses.  Serve immediately.

Makes 6 servings.

room in the receiving container to hold a cup of liquid without touching
the strainer.  Cover with an inverted plastic bag and put in the

volume will reduce to about half, or 15 ounces yogurt will yield about 1

Fig Ice Cream

1 1/2 cup whipping cream
1/2 cup sugar; plus:
1 tablespoon sugar
3  egg yolks
1  vanilla; to taste
1  cognac or brandy (optional) - to ta; ste

Wash the figs, cut off the stem ends, and cut in quarters into a
non-corroding saucepan.  Add the water and cook slowly until very
tender, about 20 minutes, stirring often. The cooking time will
depend on the variety of fig you are using and how thick the skin is.
Coarsely chop the figs in a food processor, or put them through a
food mill, or crush well with a potato masher. Warm 1 cup of the
cream with the sugar in a non-corroding saucepan, stirring
occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved.  Whisk the egg yolks
just enough to mix them and whisk in some of the hot cream mixture to
warm them. Return to the pan and cook over low heat, stirring
constantly, until the custard coats the spoon. Strain through a
medium-fine strainer into a container. Add the remaining cream and
1-1/2 cups of the fig puree.  Flavor to taste with a few drops each
of vanilla and Cognac or brandy. Chill thoroughly. Freeze according

Gooseberry Burnt Creams

fruits, deserts, ice cream

1 lb tart green gooseberries
4 oz caster sugar (or more)
5 oz granulated sugar
1/2 lb fromage blanc or quark*
1/2 pint double cream

*Note: Creamy Greek yoghurt may also be used instead of fromage blanc
or quark. Choose a heavy-based saucepan with a large surface area.
Put the topped and tailed gooseberries into it, still moistened by
the water in which they have been rinsed. Cover and cook over very
low heat until the fruit is perfectly tender. (It does not matter if
the berries collapse in cooking here as they will be crushed to a
pulp for serving.) Crush the cooked fruit with a potato masher and
cook for several minutes more, without the lid but just stirring
occasionally, until most of the juices have evaporated leaving a
thick fruit puree.  Add caster sugar to taste and stir until melted.
Spoon the puree into 8 individual cocotte dishes and leave until
cold. Beat the fromage blanc, quark or yoghurt into the cream until
smoothly mixed then whisk until fairly stiff. Spoon the creamy
mixture over the cold puree and level the tops. Cover and chill in
the freezer for about 45 minutes until the cream firms up. Dissolve
the granulated sugar in 1 tablespoon warm water in a pan placed over
low heat. Then turn the heat up and cook until the sugar carmelises
to a rich shade of gold.  Quickly pour the burnt sugar evenly over
the chilled creams and set aside for 20 minutes or so until the
caramel sets in thin brittle sheets of gold.

Grand Opera Creams

ice cream, candy

2 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup light cream
2 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon light corn syrup
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
2 oz semisweet chocolate
2 teaspoon solid vegetable shortening

Combine sugar, salt, cream, butter, and corn syrup in a heavy 2
1/2-quart saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Cook at a
gentle boil, stirring frequently, until the mixture reaches 238
degrees F on the candy thermometer (soft ball stage).

Remove from heat and cool, without stirring, until mixture is 110
degrees F. Add vanilla and beat vigorously until candy is thick and
loses its gloss. Quickly drop by teaspoonfuls into mounds on waxed
paper. If the candy gets too stiff and dry before this is completed,
knead each dropped candy between fingers or roll between the palms of
the hands. It will soften and become more attractive. Let candy stand
until firm to the touch.

Meanwhile, melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering
water. Stir in vegetable shortening. Spoon a small amount of chocolate
glaze over each cream. Let stand until set. Wrap in plastic and store
in refrigerator. Makes about 24 candies.

fruits, ice cream

1 1/4 lb green apples, crisp; about 5 cups, sliced
2 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice, fresh
1 1/4 cup water
1 1/4 cup sugar
1 dash cinnamon

Wash the apples well, quarter and core them, then slice the quarters
thinly crosswise. Toss the apple slices in a bowl with the lemon
juice, until all are evenly coated. Cover the bowl tightly with a lid
or with plastic wrap and freeze the apple slices for several hours,
or overnight.

Combine the water and sugar in a saucepan and stir gently over medium
heat until all the sugar is dissolved. Bring the syrup to a boil and
let it boil for a few minutes. Transfer the syrup to a bowl and let
it cool completely.

Put the frozen apple slices and cooled syrup into the food processor
and puree as smoothly as possible. This puree will always have a
little texture from the flecks of green apple peel. Add a little dash
of cinnamon, not too much, and give it another spin. Put the puree
into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's
instructions.

Hazelnut Crepes With Coffee Ice Cream - Glorious Liqueurs

ice cream

1/2 cup whole hazelnuts
1/2 cup milk
1/3 cup brewed coffee, cooled
1/3 cup frangelico and/or kahlua
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/8 teaspoon almond extract
3  eggs
1 cup flour
3 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted and
1  cooled
1  oil for pan
1 pint coffee ice cream
1  caramel coffee nut sauce*
1  and/or
1  mocha fudge sauce*

*Separate recipes in this series.

To toast hazelnuts:

Bake in a 300F. oven, shaking several times, until skins darken,
loosen and crack, about 15 minutes. Cool slightly, transfer to a
towel. Fold towel to encase, rub vigorously to loosen the skins.
Remove and discard as much of the skin as possible.

Transfer skins to blender or food processor. Pulse on/off until finely
chopped.

Crepes: Combine milk, Frangelico, vanilla and almond extracts and eggs
until blended. Add flour al at once and beat until smooth and all of
the flour has been absorbed. Beat in the hazelnuts, butter and sugar.
Cover and refrigerate at least two hours, but preferably overnight.

Return batter to room temperature.

Heat crepe pan until water spits across. Lightly oil and heat until
hot. Remove pan from heat, pour in 1/4 cup batter and swirl quickly
to coat bottom. Return pan to heat.

Cook until crepe is golden brown on bottom; turn and cook other side.
Transfer to plate, separating crepes with waxed paper. Repeat with
remaining batter, oiling pan as needed.

The crepes can be prepared to this point ahead of time. Rewarm by
removing waxed paper, wrapping in tin foil and baking in a preheated
350F. oven on a cookie sheet for about 15 minutes.

Quickly roll warm crepes around small scoops of ice cream. Serve with
one or both of the sauces.

      ----CATEGORY 13, TOPIC 26 MESSAG---

Just mix it all together and freeze it according to your freezer
instructions.

This is for a gallon freezer so you will have to cut it in half for a
smaller freezer. You have to allow for expansion while it freezing so
don't fill the container too full.

If we are not going to be eating this right away I have found if I
add a small container of Cool Whip to it it keeps it from forming ice
crystals when we put it in cantainers to store in the freezer.
Usuallly we make it when we have family over and don't have too much
left.

Hypocrasse (Spiced Wine)

1  liter dry red wine

60 gm ground ginger
10 gm ground cardamom
10 gm ground nutmeg
10  whole cloves
50 centiliter rose water (optional)
100 gm sugar (up to 200)

Easy process: (more waste) Pour the wine and spices in a large
container. Wait 3 to 5 hours. Filter with a piece of old teeshirt.
Filter again if desired with coffee filter. Add sugar and adjust to
taste. Pour back in bottles or drink. Will keep at room temprature
for about 2 weeks.

Long process: (recommended) Pour wine into large container. Put
spices in a finely woven tight towel and tie shut making sure the
wine will flow thru the spices and be permeated. Let the spice bag
sit in the wine for 2 to 3 days, stirring occasionaly.  Filter as
above and add sugar. This method results in more yield because the
spices wont turn into a slime blob at the bottom and use so much
liquid.

Ice Cream Sandwiches - Martha Stewart Living

deserts, ice cream, dairy, sandwich, soup/stews

2 cup plus 2 t all-purpose flour
2 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa
5 oz semisweet chocolate
4 oz unsweetened chocolate
3/4 cup unsalted butter
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup sugar
3 large eggs, at room temperature
1 pint each strawberry, vanilla, & chocola; te ice cream

1. Combine flour and cocoa and set aside. Melt together chocolates and
butter in medium bowl set over simmering water. Stir with a wooden
spoon until smooth. Add salt and sugar, stirring until sugar is
almost completely dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove bowl from heat.
Beat in eggs one at a time, then fold in flour mixture until well
combined. Let dough cool slightly in bowl; it will be very soft.
Divide into quarters and spoon onto plastic wrap. Flatten each piece
of dough with a wooden spoon, wrap well, and refrigerate for at least
2    hours or overnight.

2. When dough is firm, cut each piece in half. Cover a work surface
with plastic wrap. Place piece of dough on the plastic and cover with
another sheet; roll out to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Keeping dough in
plastic, transfer to a baking sheet; place in freezer. Repeat process
until all dough is and rolled out. Stack sheets of dough in freezer
and chill until very firm, about 30 minutes,

3. Heat oven to 350'. Line 1 baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove
sheets of dough from freezer one at a time. Place on a
parchment-lined work surface and peel off plastic wrap. Using a 2
1/2- inch round cookie cutter, cut out dough and transfer circles to
baking sheets. Work quickly to prevent the dough from becoming too
soft.

4. Bake until cookies are firm to the touch, 14 to 16 minutes, turning
baking sheet halfway through baking. Remove from oven and let cookies
cool slightly on pan. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

5. While cookies are baking, transfer ice cream (working with one
flavor at a time) to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a
paddle attachment. Place ice cream in refrigerator to soften
slightly, about 15 minutes. Beat ice cream on medium-high speed until
soft enough to spread, about 2 minutes, or beat with a wooden spoon.
Set bowl in a second bowl filled with ice. Spoon some softened ice
cream onto a cookie and top with another cookie. Place sandwich in
freezer and continue process. After the ice cream has hardened, wrap
sandwiches tightly in plastic wrap. Chill overnight in freezer.

Ice-Creamy Blueberry Yoghurt

deserts, ice cream

1  text only

Seems that blueberries only got to Oz in the early 70's and are only
now becoming affordable.

This is one of Gabriel Gate's excellent. low-fat recipes. It was first
published in his book Smart Food (Anne O'Donovan, 1989) for the
Anti-Cancer Council.

Blend 500 g blueberries to a puree with the juice of 2 oranges and 1
lemon.

Strain the mixture.  Stir in 1/4 cup sugar.  Beat together 1 cup
low-fat yoghurt and 2 tablespoons low-fat milk for about 5 minutes to
lighten them.

Add 1/4 cup of sugar and beat for a further minute. Gently combine the
fruit preparation with the milk and yoghurt mixture. Either freeze in
an ice cream maker or put the mixture in the freezer in a bowl and as
the mixture hardens, whisk it two or three times.  When it is too
firm to whisk any more, it is ready.

Makes 10 servings.

deserts, ice cream

2  12 oz pkg prunes - pitted, dried
2 cup water
3/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 teaspoon caramom seed -- crushed
1/4 teaspoon salt
      ----TORTE LAYER----
4 cup all-purpose flour -- sifted
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter -- softened
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2  eggs
1/4 cup milk
1  confectioner's sugar

Drain prunes, reserving liquid. Chop prunes finely. Add 3/4 cup
granulated sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla; the cardamom, 1/4 teaspoon
salt, and 1/2 cup reserved cooking liquid; mix until ingredients are

sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time,
beating well after each addition. At low speed, add flour mixture
alternately with milk, beginning and ending with flour mixture.
Refrigerate dough until chilled and easy to handle-about 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Divide dough into 7 equal pieces. For
each layer, invert an 8-inch round layer cake pan. Flatten a piece of

Cover completely with plastic film or foil. Refrigerate at least 24
hours, to mellow. To serve: Sprinkle top with confectioners sugar.
Cut in thin slices. Pass whipped cream. Return unused portion to

Individual Almond-Cream Tarts

deserts, ice cream

2 1/2 cup flour,all-purpose
2/3 cup butter or margarine,cold
1/2 cup water,cold
2  eggs,separated
2 pkg vanilla pudding(3 3/8oz)
2 1/2 cup milk
1 cup whipping cream
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 can mandarin-orange sect.(11oz)
1  kiwifruit,medium
5  strawberries,large
1/4 lb grapes,green,seedless
1  chocolate square,unsweetened
5 1/2 oz apple jelly
1 teaspoon water

1. Whip cream. Drain mandarin-orange sections. Peel and slice
kiwifruit. Coarsely grate chocolate square. Prepare tart shells; Into
medium-sized bowl, measure flour and butter or margarine. With
fingertips, blend flour and butter until mixture resembles coarse
crumbs. In cup, beat cold water with egg yolks. Add yolk mixture to
flour mixture, stirring to mix well. Shape pastry into a ball.
2. Preheat oven to 400'F. On well-floured surface, with floured
rolling pin, roll pastry 1/8"-thick. With floured 4 1/4" round cookie
cutter, cut out 20 pastry circles, rerolling trimmings if necessary.
Gently press each circle onto bottom and up side of fluted tart pan
(or use twenty-four 2 1/2" muffin-pan cups, and cut circles with a 3
1/2" round cookie cutter). With fork, prick pastry in many places.
Arrange tart pans in 2 jelly-roll pans for easy handling. Bake 20-25
minutes until pastry is lightly browned.
3. In cup, beat egg whites until frothy. Quickly brush hot tart
shells with beaten egg whites. Cool tart shells in pans on wire racks
10 minutes. With knife, gently loosen tart shells from sides of pans;
remove from pans; cool completely on wire racks, about 20 mintes.
4. When tarts shells are cool, prepare cream filling. Prepare 2
packages of instant pudding mix as label directs, but prepare both
packages together and use only a total of only 2 1/2 cups milk. With
rubber spatula, fold whipped cream and almond extract into pudding.
5. Spoon filling into tart shells. Decorate some filled tart shells
with mandarin-orange sections, some with kiwifruit, some with
strawberries, some with grapes, and some with chocolate.
6. Prepare glaze: In small saucepan over medium-low heat, heat apple
jelly with water, stirring often, until jelly melts and mixture is
smooth; brush over fruit. Let glaze dry, about 10 minutes. Cover
tarts and refrigerate.

Island Ice Cream Soda

beverages, ice cream, alcohol

6 large egg yolks
1 pinch salt
2 cup heavy cream
15 oz can cream of coconut; (fx. coco lopez)
2 tablespoon dark rum; -or-
      Vanilla Extract ----Pineapple-Ginge
1 medium pineapple; peeled and cubed
2  in piece ginger peel; slice thinly
      Granulated Sugar ----Assembly-----
1 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
32 oz bottle seltzer water; chilled ----for garnish--
2 tablespoon macadamia nuts; chopped
4  pineapple wedges

Make the coconut ice cream:

1. In a 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer set at
medium-high speed, using the wire whisk attachment, beat the egg
yolks and salt for 5 to 7 minutes, or until they are pale yellow and
form a thick ribbon when the whisk is lifted.

2. In a heavy, medium saucepan over medium heat, bring the cream to a
gentle boil. Remove the pan from the heat and gradually stir 1 cup of
the hot cream into the beaten egg yolks until well blended. Gradually
stir this mixture back into the saucepan. Cook the custard over
medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for 2 to 4
minutes, or until the custard has thickened slightly. It is done when
you can run your finger down the back of the custard-coated spoon and
a path remains in the custard for several seconds. Do not allow the
custard to come to a boil.

3. Remove the pan from the heat and immediately strain through a
sieve into a stainless steel bowl. Place the bowl over a larger bowl
of ice water and stir the custard for 5 to 10 minutes, or until cool.
Whisk in the cream of coconut and rum or vanilla. Remove the bowl of
custard from the bowl of ice water. Cover the surface of the custard
with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, or overnight,
until very cold.

4. Scrape the chilled custard into the container of an ice cream
maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Transfer the ice cream to a medium bowl. Cover the surface of the ice
cream with plastic wrap and cover the bowl tightly with aluminum
foil. Freeze the ice cream overnight.

Make the pineapple-ginger syrup:

1. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal chopping
blade, combine the pineapple and ginger pieces. Process for 45
seconds, or until the mixture is pureed. Transfer the puree to a
medium, non-corrosive saucepan. Add the sugar to the puree and cook
over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until the
mixture comes to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer the puree for 10
minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, and cool the puree completely.
Strain the puree through a fine-meshed sieve into a medium bowl.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2
hours, until chilled.

Assemble the ice cream sodas:

1. In a chilled 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy duty electric mixer,
using the wire whip attachment, beat the cream, sugar, and vanilla at
medium-high speed until stiff peaks start to form. Fill a pastry bag
fitted with a star tip (such as Ateco #6) with the cream. Refrigerate
the cream until ready to use.

2. Pour 1/2 cup of the pineapple syrup into a tall, 16-ounce glass.
Add seltzer water almost to the top of the glass. Place a scoop of
the coconut ice cream on the side of the glass. Pipe a large rosette
of whipped cream next to the scoop. Top with 1/2 tablespoon of the
macadamia nuts and garnish with a pineapple wedge. Repeat this
procedure to make 3 more ice cream sodas. Serve immediately.

4    servings.

PREPARATION: 45 minutes plus chilling and freezing times.

Italian Ice

deserts, ice cream

4  lemons, juiced thoroughly
1 cup sugar
1 tablespoon lemon rind, grated--opt.
1  ice cubes

NOTE:  I use a high powered blender called a VITA MIX to make this
recipe. Take your chances if you use a regular blender, as chopping
the ice may be too much for it to handle. If you do use a regular
blender be sure to add the ice cubes one at a time. Put your lemon
juice and sugar in the blender container.  Blend until sugar is
dissolved. Do not wait until after the ice is put in to dissolve the
sugar as it will not dissolve completely. While blender is running
add ice cubes until the mixture turns to a slush and it cannot be
blended anymore. It may take several times of stopping and allowing
the mixture to settle or stirring it and then blending again. Just be
sure the mixture is thick and slushy. You may want to adjust the
taste with more sugar or lemon to your liking, but I found this to be
just right for our family.  Put mixture into individual freezer
containers and place in the freezer for at least four hours.  Voila!
Authentic Italian Ice! Do not substitute lemon concentrate as it does
not give the same taste result. Hope you like it.  This is one of my
originals.

another 1 1/2 hours keeping a check on the last hour stirring often.
As soon as it starts to thicken turn it off if you like it real
creamy, let cook longer if you like it thick. It will thicken a lot
after it cools. I use skim milk, omit the butter, and sometimes if I
have it on hand add a can of evaporated milk, gives a little creamer
taste, but either way it is just as good this way and a lot less fat

Kheer (Sweet Rice)

deserts, ice cream, indian

1/3 cup rice, short or medium grain
10 cup milk
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1  bay leaf
1/2 cup sugar
2 tablespoon almonds, sliced; lightly toasted (opt)

[Yes, these proportions *are* right, only 1/3 cup
uncooked rice to 10 cups milk.]

Wash the rice and set it aside to drain.  In a tall
pot that can hold at least twice the volume of the
milk, bring the milk to a boil; then adjust the heat
so the milk is always rising and frothing, but not
bubbling over. To minimize the cooking time, let the
milk boil vigorously, uncovered, for the first 15
minutes, while you stir it rhythmically with a wooden
spatula to prevent the thick milk on the bottom of the
post from scorching.

Drop the rice into the milk along with the bay leaf.
Continue stirring. Keep over medium-high heat and stir
very carefully for another 20 minutes until the rice
breaks up and rolls with the milk. By now the milk
should be reduced to two thirds of its original
volume. Stir in the sugar, cardamom, and almonds.
Cook for 5 more minutes and remove from the heat.
Sweet rice should be only slightly thick when removed
from the heat, because it will thicken when
refrigerated. Chill well before serving.

For other classic flavours, replace the cardamom with
a teaspoon of rose water and a few pinches of saffron
powder.

Onion Sorbet

ice cream

2/3 cup sugar
2/3 cup water
3 large yellow onions
1/4 cup wine vinegar
1/4 cup parsley, fresh; fine minced
2  scallions; finely minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup yogurt, plain
1  fresh parsley or chive; mince

"This is wonderful with cold meats. Serve the sorbet in pretty lettuce
cups, avocado halves, small green pepper halves, or hollowed-out
small (not cherry--they're too small) tomatoes."

Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan. Over medium-high
heat, cook and stir until sugar is dissolved. Just before the boil,
remove syrup from heat and allow to cool. Cover and refrigerate.

Boil yellow onions, drain and puree.

Combine onion puree, vinegar, parsley, scallions, salt, and chilled
syrup and blend well. Place mixture in an ice cream maker and freeze
until sorbet is still soft. Add yogurt and continue churning. (If
using a conventinal freezer, freeze in a stainless-steel container.
Thaw partially, spoon mixture into a food processor or blender, and
process until smooth. Add yogurt and blend well. Refreeze.)

Serve garnished with parsley and/or chives.

Orange Ice

beverages, deserts, ice cream

1  lemons
9  oranges
1 1/2 quart water
4 cup sugar
1  egg whites

Juice lemons and oranges, being very careful to extract every seed,
as they cause a bitter taste.  To a syrup made of water and sugar add
juices, and when partly frozen add the meringue of one egg.

When frozen fill in the orange fruit cases ad place in Ice-cream Cave
for three or four hours, and it is then made more delicious by
covering the ice in each case with a meringue and browning quickly
with a red hot salamander, serving immediately. The orange pulp taken
from cases can be used in obtaining juice.

Paneer Patties In Orange Perfumed Cream Sauce

deserts, ice cream, indian

1  stephen ceideburg
2 cup water
1/4 cup + 1 tablespoon sugar
1 quart half-and-half
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
2 tablespoon all-purpose flour
8 oz paneer (see recipe)
2 tablespoon chopped unsalted pistachios

Two 3-inch pieces gold or silver leaf (varak), optional (see note)

This version of a popular Indian restaurant dessert sports a
California touch - grated orange peel. You may add cardamom, saffron
or rose essence if you prefer a classic Indian flavor.

Combine water and 1/4 cups sugar in a medium saucepan; bring to a
boil, stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat and
simmer for 12 minutes.

Combine the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar, the half-and-half and
orange zest in a heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and
simmer until sauce is reduced by one third, about 30 minutes. Remove
from heat and let cool.

Meanwhile, mix together flour and paneer; knead until fluffy and
thoroughly mixed, Form mixture into walnut-size balls and flatten
into 1/4-inch thick patties.

Working in batches, poach patties in simmering sugar syrup until they
are firm, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn gently and cook 1 minute longer.

Using a slotted spoon, transfer patties to a serving bowl. Pour in the
cream sauce and remaining sugar syrup. Cover and refrigerate for 6 to
8 hours, or until well chilled, (May be made up to 4 days ahead.)

Just before serving, sprinkle with chopped pistachios and, decorate
with gold leaf, if desired.

Note: Gold and silver leaf is available at Indian markets and
specially food stores.

Pa-Pao-Fan (Eight Treasure Rice Pudding)

ice cream, chinese, puddings

2 cup glutinous rice
1/4 cup lard
1/2 lb pitted dates; finely chopped
8  whole dates; cut in half
1 cup canned red bean paste
20  dried jujubes
2 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon melted lard
1  red & green candied cherries
      ----SYRUP----
1/4 cup sugar
1 cup ; cold water
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 tablespoon cornstarch; dissolve in
3 tablespoon ; cold water

"This dessert is known as eight-treasure or eight-precious or even
eight-jewel pudding because in China the design on the top of it was
made with 8 different kinds of dried and candied fruits or nuts --
such as dried lotus seeds, candied green or red plums, seeded
dragon's eye nuts, watermelon seeds, preserved dates, dried jujubes,
candied orange peel, candied red or green cherries, and blanched
walnuts. The version described here is simply decorated with pitted
dates, dried jujubes and candied cherries."

Prepare ahead: 1. In a large bowl, cover the rice with cold water and
soak for 2 hours.

2. In a 12-inch wok or 10-inch skillet, melt the 1/4 cup lard over
moderate heat. Add the chopped dates and red-bean paste, and cook
over low heat, stirring frequently, for 20 minutes, or until the
mixture begins to come away from the sides of the pan. emove from the
pan to a small bowl and cool to room temperature.

3. Combine the jujubes and 2 cups cold water in a 2-quart saucepan.
Over high heat, bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to
low and simmer the jujubes, covered, for about 10 minutes. Drain the
jujubes through a sieve, and, when they are cool enough to handle,
cut them in half and remove and discard the pits.

4. Have the rice, date and bean-paste mixture, jujubes, cherries,
sugar, water, almond extract and cornstarch all within easy reach.

To cook: 5. Pour enough boiling water into the lower part of a
steamer to come within an inch of the cooking rack (or use a steamer
substitute). Line the rack with a double layer of paper towels. Drain
the rice and spread it evenly over the lined rack. Over high heat,
bring the water in the steamer to a rolling boil, cover the pan
tightly and steam the rice for 30 minutes, or until the rice is
thoroughly cooked, replenishing the water if it boils away.

6. Transfer the rice to a bowl, and stir into it the 2 tablespoons of
sugar and 2 tablespoons of melted lard. Spoon half the rice into a
shallow heat-proof bowl (about 6 inches across and 3 inches deep). On
top, place the red-bean-paste mixture, spreading it to within 1/2
inch of the sides of the bowl. Place the remaining rice over it,
spreading it out evenly to the edges of the bowl and pressing down on
it lightly with the palm of your hand. Put an inverted dinner plate
over the top of the bowl, and, grasping the edges of both the plate
and the bowl, turn them over together. Lift the bowl up gently to
unmold the pudding.

7. Now decorate the sides and top of the pudding with the jujubes,
halved dates and candied cherries. Any sort of design you devise
would be proper. For instance, the bottom edge of the pudding may be
decorated with a row of date halves spaced about an inch apart, the
top edge rimmed with jujubes, laid side by side, and the top of the
pudding ornamented with flowers and leaves made of cherries.

8. When the decoration is complete, gently spread a long piece of
plastic wrap over it to hold the fruit in place, invert the bowl
again and carefully set it over the top of the pudding. Grasping the
edges of the bowl and plate together, turn the bowl over and remove
the plate. Bring the water in the steamer to a boil again, place the
bowl on the rack and cover the pan tightly. Steam the pudding for an
hour, replenishing the water when it boils away. Have a kettle of
boiling water handy.

To Serve: 9. A few minutes before the pudding is done, make the syrup
by combining the 1/4 cup of sugar with the cup of water in a small
saucepan and boiling it until the sugar dissolves. Add the almond
extract, give the cornstarch mixture a quick stir to recombine it and
sitr it into the syrup. Cook, stirring, for a few seconds until the
syrup thickens slightly and becomes clear. Now remove the pudding
from the steamer and place a circular serving plate over it. Grasping
bowl and plate securely, turn them over. The pudding should slide out
easily. Carefully peel off the plastic wrap. Pour the hot syrup over
the pudding and serve at once.

Pistachio Ice Cream

deserts, ice cream

2 1/2 cup milk
3  eggs
1 cup sugar
1 cup whipping cream, whipped
1 1/4 cup pistachio nuts.
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
1 tablespoon pure almond extract

BLANCH  the nuts by placing in a bowl for one minute and pouring
boiling water over it (  the nuts should be out of the shells). Drain
and peel. BLEND the nuts, the milk, the eggs, and the sugar until you
have a green smooth liquid.  Pour into a saucepan. COOK over low heat
until the custard thickens, about 25 minutes or so. Do not boil or it
will curdle. COOL. When cool, add vanilla and almond extracts.  Stir.
FOLD in whipped cream.

FREEZE in an ice cream maker or in a container or bowl in your
freezer. If you use the bowl in freezer method, you should pull the
bowl out 2 or 3 times and mix the mixture with a mixer. The frozen
custard on the sides of the bowl should be moved into the rest of the
mixture. This incorporates air and breaks up ice crystals.

This ice cream takes a LOT of time, particularly considering that you
have to blanch the nuts.  If you don't mind lots of peel in your ice
cream, you can pass, but this makes a really unsavory ice cream.

If you've never had homemade ice cream before, you will be surprised
at the richer, tastier, smoother, and denser ice cream a homemade
version will give you. You will have to soften it before scooping it,
as real ice cream always requires.

Pistachio Kulfi Pops

deserts, ice cream, ethnic, indian

1 1/2 quart whole milk
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 cup shelled roasted pistachios
8  paper cups or
1  cooking parchment or
1  waxed paper
8  ice cream sticks (opt)

In a 6-8 quart pan over high heat, stir milk and sugar until
simmering. Over medium-high heat, boil until reduced to 2 cups, 25-35
minutes, stirring often; slide pan partially off heat if milk
threaten to boil over. Let cool; to speed cooling, set pan in ice
water.

Coarsely chop pistachio nuts; stir into cooled reduced milk mixture.

Set paper cups in a rimmed pan. Or, to make cones, cut 8 pieces of
parchment or waxed paper into 7-1/2" squares. Fold each piece in half
to make a triangle. With long edge toward you, bring 1 of the 45'
angles to the top of the triangle, then roll toward other angle. To
close hole at bottom, starting from the top, press 1 inside sheet to
tyhe opposite side. Tape the cone in a few places to hold it
together. Support each cone, pointed end down, in a cup slightly
taller than the cone; set cups in a rimmed pan.

Divide milk mixture among cups or cones. Freeze until kulfi is thick
but not hard, 1 to 1-1/2 hours; then, if desired, push an ice cream
stick into each container. Freeze until firm, about 2 hours longer.
To eat, peel off paper. To store, seal kjulfi (still in cups or
cones) in a parge plastic bag; freeze for up to 2 weeks.

Poached Apples With Maple Cream

fruits, deserts, ice cream

4 large firm apples
1 cup maple syrup
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon butter
1 teaspoon all-purpose flour
1/2 cup light cream or half-and-half pare a; nd core apples.

In a saucepan, combine the syrup and water. Bring to a boil and
simmer 3 minutes. Add the apples and cover. Simmer until the apples
are tender but not mushy, 3 to 8 minutes. With slotted spoon, lift
the apples onto individual dessert dihes or plates. Boil syrup until
reduced to 3/4 cup. Pour syrup into a measuring cup. melt butter in
the saucepan. Blend in the flour, cream and the syrup. Boil,
uncovered, until reduced to 1 cup, about 3 minutes. Serve warm, or at
room temperature. *NOTE- Because the apples are pared before cooking,
they will cook very quickly. Certain varieties might even get mushy
all of a sudden. Watch them VERY carefully while cooking; it just
takes minutes. This dessert is delicious and beatiful when you serve
one whole apple on a plate surrounded with the maple-and-cream sauce.

Rice Flan Tart With Candied Ginger

deserts, ice cream, rice

3 cup nonfat milk
1/2  vanilla bean, split
1/4 cup medium-grain rice
1/2 cup sugar
1  (8-ounce) carton frozen
1  egg substitute, thawed
1/3 cup low-fat ricotta cheese or
1  pureed fat-free cottage
1  cheese
2 tablespoon finely slivered candied
1  ginger
1  low-fat sweet pastry
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 tablespoon powdered sugar, optional
1  sliced candied ginger,
1  optional
      ----LOWFAT SWEET PASTRY----
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons oat flour
1  blend
5 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cake flour
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom or cinnamon
2 1/2 tablespoon sugar
3 teaspoon cold butter, diced
1 tablespoon canola oil

2-2 1/2 tb very cold water The low-calorie rice pudding flan is so
delicious by itself that you may want to save the calories and fat in
the crust, and serve it without the pastry. Bring nonfat milk to boil
in medium saucepan. Add vanilla bean and rice. Cover partially and
simmer until rice is almost tender, about 20 to 30 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Stir in sugar and continue and continue cooking 3
minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Remove vanilla bean.
Blend egg substitute with ricotta cheese. Stir into rice mixture with
candied ginger. Carefully pour into prepared pastry shell, filling
almost to the top (if there is any flan mixture left from incomplete
reduction in cooking, place in small custard dish, cover and
microwave 40 to 60 seconds or until set.) Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon
cinnamon. Bake at 400 degrees F. 25 to 30 minutes or until set.
Remove from oven. Sift powdered sugar over and sprinkle with
remaining cinnamon. Serve warm and garnish with sliced ginger if
desired. Makes 12 servings. Each serving contains about: 183
calories; 102 mg sodium; 11 mg cholesterol; 4 grams fat; 31 grams
carbohydrates; 6 grams protein; 0.25 gram fiber. The use of oat flour
blend and cake flour is what gives this low-fat crust its tenderness.
It also makes it more difficult to roll, but don't despair: The dough
is easily patched. Low-Fat Sweet Pastry Sift flour, cardamom and
sugar into large bowl. Rub in butter with fingers or cut in with
pastry blender until size of small peas. Using fork, stir in oil.
Slowly add cold water, 1 teaspoon at a time, tossing with fork until
flour is moistened without being wet. Gather dough with moist hands,
shape into flattened round and let rest about 15 minutes. Roll
1/8-inch thick on lightly floures board. (To facilitate rolling,
dough may also be rolled between sheets of wax paper Or unrolled
dough may be placed in pan and gently pressed  to cover inside of
pan.) Gently lift and press onto 9-inch square tart pan with
removable bottom. Cut off dough edges. Bake at 425 degrees F. 10 to
15 minutes or until golden brown. Makes 12 servings. NOTE: Unsalted
butter will give a more delicate fresh flavor in this pastry. Add a
dash of salt if using.

Rice Pudding Dr. Fagley

deserts, ice cream

1 quart milk
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup rice, washed

This is a recipe from mom's childhood.  The directions use tea cups,
lumps of butter the size of a walnut and rice (washed but not
precooked.) This is not a sweet dessert but a side dish to be served
at family reunions with turkey, chicken, and as an alternate to
potatoes. The directions suggest putting together in a slow oven for
about 1 hour. Stir in the brown top from time to time.

The recipe came from my Grest Aunt Kate and was a favorite at parties

Rice Pudding With Stout

deserts, ice cream, rice

1 cup medium grain rice -- (fx.
1  calrose)
2 cup water
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon unsalted butter -- * see
1  note
1 tablespoon fine bread crumbs --
1  (approximately)
4 large eggs
1 cup stout -- ** see note
1 cup whipping cream
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 lb pitted dates -- chopped (2/3
1  cup)
2 tablespoon all-purpose flour --
1  (approximately)

* plus more for the baking dish

** (a sweet Stout in the English style -including those labeled
Oatmeal Stout, Milk Stout, or Imperial Stout- will provide a mellow
richness and overtones of coffee and chocolate, but a dry Irish-style
Stout is likely to be to bitter. Some brands of Porter might also
work if on the sweet side.)

1. Combine the rice, water, and salt in a heavy saucepan. Bring to a
boil, reduce the heat, cover, and cook until the water is absorbed,
about 15 minutes. Remove from heat, fluff with fork, cover, and let
cool.

2. Butter the bottom and sides of a 6-cup baking disk or 8 individual
casseroles (ramekins). Sprinkle with bread crumbs and roll the dish
around to coat all the surface with crumbs. Tap out excess.

3. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Beat the eggs lightly in a large
bowl. Add the Stout, 1/3 cup of the cream, vanilla, sugar, and spices
and stir to combine. Add the rice and stir to break up any clumps.
Toss the dates in flour to coat them evenly, shaking off the excess,
and stir them in. Pour the mixture into the baking dish. Cut the
butter into small pieces and scatter them on top. Bake uncovered
until set, about 1 hour. Serve warm, with the rest of the cream,
lightly whipped.

Serves 8.

Rich Vanilla Ice Cream

deserts, ice cream

3 cup heavy cream
1 cup whole milk
3/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoon (yes, tablespoons, not teaspoons!); vanilla
5  egg yolks

Heat cream, milk and sugar in heavy saucepan, stirring until sugar
dissolves. Add egg yolks by adding some mixture to eggs to dilute,
and then adding diluted eggs to rest of pan (adding straight will
cook them and make for lumpy cream). Whisk constantly over med heat
until mixture coats the back of a spoon (seems to take forever, about
10 min?). DO NOT LET BOIL (or it will curdle) Strain, if you want,
and add vanilla (I never strain, it comes out fine). Cool completely
in refrigerator. Freeze according to manufacturers instructions.
Makes about 1 quart. ( I double this if using the hand crank - it has
a much larger capacity, but doesn't seem to last any longer after its
made.... Hmmm....)

Rose Ice Cream

ice cream

1 1/2 cup whipping cream
1 1/2 cup milk
2/3 cup sugar
3  egg yolks
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoon rose-scented geranium leaves; chopped
1 1/2 cup rose petals*
1 teaspoon rose water or up to 3
2 tablespoon pink rose petals**

*Loosely packed; white bases removed

** white bases removed; chopped

In a heavy 2-quart saucepan or double boiler over medium-low heat,
stir and heat the cream, milk, and sugar until the sugar dissolves.
Do not boil.

In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks lightly. While whisking, pour 1
cup of the hot cream mixture into the bowl, then pour the egg mixture
back into the saucepan and place over medium-low heat. Stir
constantly with a wooden spoon (don't let the mixture boil; it could
curdle) for about 8 minutes, or until it begins to thicken and coats
the spoon. To test for doneness, dip a metal spoon into the mixture
and run your finger across the back. The custard is done when your
finger leaves a clear, clean trail. A candy thermometer should read
175-180 degrees F. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the
vanilla.

Stir the chopped rose-scented geranium leaves and the 1 1/2 cups of
rose petals into the hot prepared ice-cream base. Cover and chill in
the refrigerator for at least 1 hour (the longer it is refrigerated,
the stronger the flavor will be). Strain the mixture and add rose
water to taste, if desired. Stir in the chopped rose petals. Pour the
mixture into an ice-cream maker and freeze according to the
manufacturer's instructions.

Saffron Kulfi Pops

deserts, ice cream, ethnic, indian

1 1/2 quart whole milk
1/3 cup sugar
1/16 teaspoon powdered saffron or
1/8 teaspoon saffron threads
1 tablespoon boiling water
8  paper cups or
1  cooking parchment or
1  waxed paper
8  ice cream sticks (opt)

In a 6-8 quart pan over high heat, stir milk and sugar until
simmering. Over medium-high heat, boil until reduced to 2 cups, 25-35
minutes, stirring often; slide pan partially off heat if milk
threaten to boil over. Let cool; to speed cooling, set pan in ice
water.

Place saffron in a small bowl. Add boiling water, stir, and let stand
for 5 minutes. Break up threads with a small spoon. Scrape mixture
into warm reduced milk mixture.

Set paper cups in a rimmed pan. Or, to make cones, cut 8 pieces of
parchment or waxed paper into 7-1/2" squares. Fold each piece in half
to make a triangle. With long edge toward you, bring 1 of the 45'
angles to the top of the triangle, then roll toward other angle. To
close hole at bottom, starting from the top, press 1 inside sheet to
tyhe opposite side. Tape the cone in a few places to hold it
together. Support each cone, pointed end down, in a cup slightly
taller than the cone; set cups in a rimmed pan.

Divide milk mixture among cups or cones. Freeze until kulfi is thick
but not hard, 1 to 1-1/2 hours; then, if desired, push an ice cream
stick into each container. Freeze until firm, about 2 hours longer.
To eat, peel off paper. To store, seal kjulfi (still in cups or
cones) in a parge plastic bag; freeze for up to 2 weeks.

Cook sago in water first until they loose the white color and look
transparent. Set aside. Melt butter in a heavy saucepan. Fry
vermicelli until pieces turn golden brown. This happens rapidly so
watch out. Pour in the hot milk and bring to a simmer. Adjust heat to
keep milk simmering vigorously without letting it boil over. Add
cooked sago (with or without the water), raisins, cardamom.

Let cook for about 20 minutes with frequent stirring. Add sugar and
cook another 5 minutes. Serve hot or chilled in refrigerator. One can
replace the vermicelli with sago but this kind of has a bland taste.

1  flowers for garnish (optional)

Servings: 12

For elegance and drama, borrow the Sazerac tradition of serving
colorful sorbets in a glistening swan ice sculpture. The ice mold,
which is truly impressive, is easy to create with a soft-plastic mold
filled with distilled water and frozen overnight. The next day,
simply pull off the plastic. Info on ordering the mold included at
end of recipe.

DIRECTIONS: If using ice swan, prepare several days in advance. Fill
mold with distilled water. Freeze until firm throughout. Remove from
mold and return to freezer until ready to use.

To make Lemon Sorbet, in 2 quart saucepan, heat water and sugar to
boiling; boil mixture 5 minutes. Cool sugar mixture to room
temperature. Stir in mineral water, lemon juice, and rind. Gently
fold in egg white. Freeze according to Freezing Directions (below).

To make Strawberry Sorbet, in 2 quart saucepan, heat sugar and water
to boiling; boil mixture 5 minutes. Cool sugar mixture to room
temperature. In food processor, with chopping blade, puree
strawberries, a cup at a time. Strain juice and pulp into bowl;
discard seeds. Stir strawberry puree and orange and lemon juices into
sugar mixture. Freeze according to Freezing Directions (below).

To make Blackberry Sorbet, in 2 quart saucepan, heat sugar and water
to boiling; boil mixture 5 minutes. Cool sugar mixture to room
temperature. In food processor, with chopping blade, puree
blackberries, a cup at a time. Strain juice and pulp into bowl;
discard seeds. Gently fold blackberry puree and egg whites into sugar
mixture. Freeze according to Freezing Directions (below).

Just before serving, place swan on cloth napkin lined serving platter
and garnish with mint and flowers, if desired. Scoop sorbets into
swan or a glass bowl and serve immediately.

Freezing Directions: If using ice cream maker, freeze sorbet mixture
following manufacturer's directions. If not using an ice cream maker,
pour sorbet mixture into 13 by 9 inch baking pan; cover and freeze 6
to 8 hours or until frozen. Remove sorbet from freezer; cut into 1
inch squares and let stand at room temperature 20 minutes or until
slightly softened. Meanwhile, chill large bowl and beaters of
electric mixer. Place softened sorbet squares in chilled bowl. Beat
on low speed until squares are broken up, then beat on high speed
until smooth and fluffy- about 1 minute. Pack sorbet into a freezer
container and freeze until ready to serve.

greased cookie sheet. Set oven for 475 degrees. Brush with the beaten
egg and bake in the middle of the oven 8-10 minutes until golden and
baked through. Set them out to cool.

To make the filling: cut off the top of each bun and scoop out a
hollow in the bottom half with a spoon. Mix the scooped-out bits with
the almond paste.  Add cream to thin the mixture to a soft, smooth
consistency. Fill the buns with the almond-paste mixture and put the
tops back on. Using stiff whipped cream in a pastry bag, squeeze out
a wreath of whipped cream around the top of each bun, then sprinkle
with powdered sugar and serve.

pan in smooth ball.

2. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring constantly, for 2
minutes or until coating begins to form on bottom of pan. Turn out
into large bowl; stir for 30 seconds to cool slightly.

3. Make a well in centre of flour mixture. Using electric mixer, beat
in eggs, one-quarter at a time, beating well after each addition;
beat until smooth, shiny, and pastry just holds its shape when lifted.

4. Using large pastry bag fitted with 1/2-inch wide star tip and
starting at centre, pipe pastry to fill each circle, raising bag
while continually piping to form 2 smaller circles on top to resemble
beehive. (Or drop by 1/4 cup, spreading with spoon to cill circle and
shaping to form beehive.

Soda Fountain Ice Cream Sodas Sqm Sss

beverages, ice cream

1  it's in the directions!

***Excerpt from "Square Meals": "Traditionally, an ice cream soda is
flavoring, charged water, ice cream, and possibly a nice dab of whipped
cream. The technique is 1-2-3: put 2T of syrup or flavoring in the bottom
of the largest glass you have. Add seltzer water, stirring as you pour, to
within 2" of the lip of the glass. Add one large scoop of very firm ice
cream, trying to get it to straddle the rim of the glass, yet still
submerge in the seltzer enough to begin reacting with the bubbles to create
a foamy head. If the ice cream is too deep in the flavored seltzer, the
soda will overflow. If it doesn't touch the seltzer at all, you don't have
a soda. With a little practice, you will reach a perfect balance. Top the
soda with a hefty squirt of whipped cream. Black-and-White: Chocolate
syrup, seltzer, vanilla ice cream. Bodacious Black-and-White: Chocolate
syrup, seltzer, French vanilla ice cream. Canary Island Special: Vanilla
syrup, seltzer, chocolate ice cream. Black Cow: Root beer afloat with
vanilla ice cream, hold the whipped cream. Brown Cow: Coca Cola, 1T
chocolate syrup, and vanilla ice cream. Strawberry Soda (In the Hay): 1/4c
strawberry syrup, a splash of milk, seltzer, and vanilla or strawberry ice
cream. Hoboken: 1/2c pineapple syrup, a splash of milk, seltzer, and
chocolate ice cream. Boston Cooler: For the sophisticate. Dry ginger ale
with a scoop of vanilla; no whipped cream. Catawba Flip: An antique-tasting
soda that dates back to the 1860's, made without whipped cream. The
traditional flavoring is grape syrup, but Welch's Concentrate Grape Juice
will do it. 1 scoop vanilla ice cream, 2oz grape juice, 1 egg, shaved ice,
seltzer. Blend all but seltzer. Strain into tall glass then fill with
seltzer. "Square Meals" by Jane and Michael Stern.

Spanish Cream

deserts, ice cream, new zealand

2 1/2 cup milk (one imperial pint)
4 teaspoon gelatine
2  eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla essence
1/3 cup sugar

Save a small amount of the milk; put the rest in a saucepan, together with
the sugar and vanilla and heat.

Separate the egg whites and save for later.  Beat the egg yolks with the
remainder of the milk and add to the heating mixture.

Stir to ensure the sugar is dissolved and bring to near boiling point to
thoroughly cook the eggs.  Do not actually boil.  Take the saucepan off the
heat.  Dissolve the gelatine in about 1/4 cup of boiling water and stir
into hot custard. Pour into serving dish and put into refrigerator to cool.

When mixture has cooled and almost set (it should be shivery at this point)
thoroughly beat the egg whites until stiff and fold them in using a metal
spoon.  Return mixture to refrigerator to properly set.

NOTES:

*  Exquisite New Zealand custard dessert -- This dessert was a family
favourite, and although we used to eat it in conjunction with some flavored
jellies, it's delicious in its  own right.  The recipe comes from my
mother, and I don't know what the Spanish part signifies.

*  The texture of this dessert is supposed to be semi-fluffy.  If you fold
in the egg whites too soon, the liquid custard won't support them and you
end up with a two-layer result, solid custard on top, very light on the
bottom. Some people may like this, but it's not the way I make it. On the
other hand, if you leave things too long, it becomes difficult to fold in
the egg whites at all.

*  It's a good idea to whip the custard a little with a fork prior to
folding in the whites. This breaks up the custard a little.

*  Depending on sweetness of taste, you may wish to alter the amount of
sugar. Our family had a sweet tooth, and I've reduced the original quantity
as it is.

*  One of the amazing things about this dessert is that it's so easy to
make, and yet tastes so good.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes + setting.

herbs

1 1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup heavy cream
2  vanilla beans, split and scraped
1 large egg
3 large egg yolks
1/3 cup sugar

1. Combine milk, cream, and vanilla beans and scrapings in a small
saucepan and heat until small bubbles form around the edge. Remove
from heat, cover, and let steep for 30 minutes. Strain, discarding
vanilla beans. Heat oven to 325'. Place a roasting pan in oven and
pour in 2 inches of hot water.

2. Whisk together egg, egg yolks, and sugar. Slowly whisk in milk
mixture, then strain and skim off any foam. Pour into four 6-oz
custard cups and arrange them evenly in roasting pan in oven. The
water should reach halfway up the sides of custard cups. Cover
roasting pan loosely with foil and bake 30 to 35 minutes. The centers
should still quake a little bit when gently shaken.

3. Remove cups from water bath and let cool for 20 minutes, then
refrigerate until ready to serve.

VARIATIONS: Substitute 3 oz smashed fresh ginger or 1 t ground
ginger, 1 cinnamon stick broken into pieces and 1/2 t ground
cinnamon, or a pinch of saffron for the vanilla bean.

Spiced Apple Pudding

deserts, ice cream, low cal

2 cup unsweetened apple juice
1/3 cup cornstarch
1  egg (or 2 yolks)
1/3 cup granulated sugar substitute
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

MY NOTE:  This recipe is marked in the allergy category only because
it is a pudding without milk, also low in protein. It is one of my
favorite ways to use up egg yolks or prepare a dessert when I've run
out of milk. Probably does not require as much sweetening as stated
in the recipe - start with 2 Tbsp. sweetener and add more if
necessary. Cost to make the whole recipe is around $1.22.

In a heavy saucepan, combine 1/2 cup apple juice and cornstarch; mix
well. Add remaining juice.  Place over medium heat and cook,
stirring, until mixture comes to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 2
minutes. Remove from heat.

In a bowl, beat egg with a fork.  Add 1/2 cup of hot mixture to
beaten egg. Stir until smooth.  Return immediately to hot mixture,
stirring constantly. (The hot mixture will cook the egg.)

Stir in sweetener and cinnamon.  Pour into 4 dessert dishes, cover
with plastic wrap to prevent skin from forming. Cool to room
temperature or chill in refrigerator.

If you prefer to use real sugar, mix 2 TBSP with the apple juice in

there is approx. 1 tsp sugar per serving if you are allowed this much

nutmeg, flour, cinnamon, salt and margarine as you would for pie
crust. Add egg yolks and yeast mixture. Blend well and form into a
ball.

Divide dough into 4 parts. Roll each into an 8- or 10-inch circle
onto wax paper. Cut into eight to ten wedges. Spread each piece with
mixture of egg white and 1/2 c. sugar and sprinkle with nuts. Roll
from wide end to pointed end to form a horn. Bake on greased cookie
sheet at 375 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes until lightly browned.

To make frosting, combine ingredients and beat until fluffy. Frost
when cooled.

If left unfrosted, can dust with powdered sugar or leave plain. For
non-spiced cookie, omit cinnamon and nutmeg. Converted by MMCONV

1  juice of 2 lemons
1  juice of 2 oranges
2  whole cloves
2  cinnamon sticks
4 slice fresh ginger

4  under-ripe pears, peeled, cored
1  burnt sugar lee cream (see recipe)

Combine the wine, water, sugar, citrus zest and juice, cloves,
cinnamon, ginger, peppercorns and vanilla bean in a heavy saucepan.
Bring to a boil, add pears, then reduce heat so the liquid barely
bubbles. Cook for 15 minutes, or until the pears are tender.  If
pears aren't completely submerged in liquid, turn them every few
minutes so they will cool evenly.

When the pears are tender, remove from liquid and set aside. Reduce
liquid to 1 cup over high heat.  Return pears to liquid and let cool
completely.

Before serving, warm the pears in their liquid over moderate heat.
Place a warm pear on a chilled plate; spoon some poaching liquid over
the top. Place a scoop of ice cream next to the pear and top with a
few threads of julienned zest from the sauce.

Spiced Quince Compote

deserts, ice cream, fruits/nuts

1 1/2 quart water
2 lb ripe (bright yellow) quinces
1 cup sugar
1/2  vanilla bean  split lengthwise
1  cinnamon stick (2-inch)
4  cloves
1/8 teaspoon cardamom seeds
2  wide strips orange peel

PUT THE WATER IN A SAUCEPAN to heat. Rinse the quinces, then using a
sharp paring knife, quarter the fruits. Carefully cut out the cores.
Hold each piece firmly as you work so that it doesn't snap in 2.
Slice each quarter into pieces about 1/2-inch thick, then cut away
the peels. As you work, put the cores and peels in the pan of
water--they will impart both flavor and body to the water, due to the
natural pectin in the fruit. Allow the skins and cores to simmer
slowly, covered, for about 20 minutes, then strain, keeping the
liquid. Don't worry about the peeled fruit discoloring--it will turn
pink when cooked. Combine the sugar, spices, orange peel and the
strained liquid in a non-corroding pan. Bring to a boil, stir to
dissolve the sugar and add the quinces. Cut out a disk of parchment
paper and place it directly on the surface to prevent any exposed
slices from drying out. Simmer slowly until the quinces have turned
pink and are slightly translucent but still firm to the touch, 2-to-2
1/2 hours. When done, transfer them to a bowl with the syrup and
chill well before serving. Once poached in syrup, quinces will last
for weeks in the refrigerator. Makes 1 Quart

Spiced Red Wine Fruit Soup With Candied Orang

soups, deserts, ice cream, fruits/nuts

      ----FRUITS----
1 small pineapple
8 small thin-skinned seedless
1  oranges or tangerines
1 1/4 cup sugar, approximately
1  half a vanilla bean, split
1  star anise pod
2 tablespoon orange liqueur
3 medium pears, such as bartlett
4 cup dry red wine
      ----BOUQUET GARNI----
12  fresh mint leaves or
2 teaspoon high-quality peppermint tea leaves
1  cinnamon stick
1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
1/2 teaspoon cardamon seeds
      ----TO FINISH----
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon cornstarch
1/2 cup creme fraiche
1/4 cup heavy cream (approximately)
1  fresh mint leaves, garnish

1.  Using a large sharp knife, trim off the top and bottom of the
pineapple and slice off the skin.  Using the tip of a vegetable
peeler, remove the eyes. Quarter the pineapple lengthwise and core
it. Slice each quarter crosswise 1/2" thick, then cut enough slices
into bite-sized pieces to make 1 cup.  Reserve balance of the
pineapple for another use. 2. In a large saucepan of simmering water,
scald the oranges for 5 seconds. Refresh under cold running water;
pat dry. Pick out the orange with the nicest skin. Using a sharp
knife, cut it crosswise into very thin slices; save any juices.
Using a vegetable peeler, strip the zest from 3 of the remaining
oranges; cut it into very thin strips; set aside. 3. Juice the 3
zested oranges. Add enough water to make 1 1/4 cups and pour into a
medium nonreactive saucepan.  Stir in the 1 1/4 cups suage and the
orange slices and their juices.  Scrape the seeds out of the vanilla
bean with the tip of a knife and set aside. Add the bean and star
anise pod to the saucepan and bring to a simmer over high heat,
stirring to dissolve the sugar. Cover, reduce the heat to low and
simmer very gently until the white of the orange slices begins to
turn translucent and the syrup takes on a rich amber color, about 1
hour.  Add a few tablespoons of water if the syrup thickens too much
before the slices are translucent. Strain the syrup and add enough
water to make 3/4 cup.  Reserve the orange slices; discard the star
anise and the vanilla bean. 4. While the orange slices are cooking,
using a small sharp knife, peel the remaining 4 oranges, removing all
the bitter white pith.  Working over a nonreactive bowl, cut in
between the membranes to release the orange sections. Squeeze the
membranes to extract all the juice.  Add the cut pineapple and orange
liqueur. Set aside to macerate until ready to assemble the soup. 5.
Peel, halve and core the pears. Slice them crosswise 1/3-inch thick.
6. In another medium nonreactive saucepan, boil the red wine over
high heat until reduced to 2 1/2 cups, about 12 minutes.  Stir in the
reserved orange syrup and orange zest and the bouquet garni (tie all
ingredients in the listing for the bouquet garnet in cheesecloth
before using). Bring to a simmer over moderately low heat. Add the
pears and poach until wine-colored and tender when pierced with a
knife, about 5 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon, transfers the pears
to a plate to cool. 7. If desired, add another teaspoon or so of
sugar to the wine mixture. Dissolve the cornstarch in 2 tablespoons
of water and whisk into wine. Return to a boil over high heat; boil
for 1 minute to thicken. Pour the soup into another nonreactive
container; let cool slightly; then cool completely in refrigerator.
Squeeze the bouquet garni gently; discard. 8.  In a food processor,
puree the reserved candied orange slices and vanilla bean seeds.  Add
the creme fraiche and blend. Thin with the heavy cream to a
semi-liquid consistency. 9. To assemble the soup: Place the poached
pear slices in chilled shallow bowls or rimmed soup plates. Scatter
the orange sections and pineapple pieces evenly on top. Ladle 1/4-cup
of the soup over each serving. Place a dollop of the creme fraiche
mixture in the center of each bowl and garnish with a mint leaf.
Makes 6-8 servings. NOTE:  If you buy organic oranges or tangerines,
you don't need to follow the scalding procedure in Step 2.

Spiced-Glazed Apple Flan

deserts, ice cream, apples

6  golden delicious apples, peeled, co; red, and coarsely chopped
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon powdered cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon powdered nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon powdered cloves
1 cup heavy cream
5  eggs

From the Washington Apple Commission.

1. Cook apples over low heat in a large saucepan with 1/4 cup sugar
and 1/4 cup water for about 15 minutes or until soft. 2. Meanwhile,
heat remaining sugar over medium heat in another saucepan with 3
tablespoons water, plus cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Stir constantly
as sugar caramelizes, and when it has turned very dark brown, pour it
immediately into a 2-quart mold, quickly turning the mold from side
to side to coat all interior surfaces with the sugar. Set aside to
cool. 3. Scald the cream by bringing it to a quick boil, then
removing immediately from heat and setting aside to cool. 4. Preheat
oven to 350'F. 5. When apples are cooked, puree them in a blender or
food processor. Beat the eggs, then slowly add scalded cream,
stirring constantly. Strain egg mixture into large bowl and add
pureed apples. Mix together well, then pour apples into mold. 6.
Place mold in a large pan of room-temperature water, then place in
oven and bake for about 1-1/2 hours, or until a knife inserted into
middle of flan comes out clean. 7. Cool to room temperature before
serving, then dip mold into warm water to melt glaze slightly and
unmold onto serving platter. May be served with whipped cream, fresh
strawberries or other fruit.

Strawberries with Jazzed up Whipped Cream xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxx xx
xxxxxxx xxxxx

This idea came to me yesterday when I bought my first basket of Oregon
strawberries for this season.  Brag all you want about your regional
products, but there is nowhere on this earth where strawberries are
sweeter or tastier than in Oregon, especially around the Portland
metro area.

Whip cream, add Kahlua during final stage. Place sliced pound cake on
a plate, top with berries and slather on whipped cream.

These recipes are of my own creation and I expect (and deserve)
appropriate credit when you add them to your cookbook

Strawberry Ice Cream

deserts, ice cream

4  egg yolks
4 cup milk
2 pint strawberries, hulled, rinsed
2 cup plus 1 t sugar
1 cup water
1 cup heavy cream

1.  Place the yolks in a large saucepan and add 1 cup sugar.  Beat with a
wire whisk until light and lemon colored. 2. Meanwhile, bring the milk
almost, but not quite, to the boil. 3. Gradually add the milk to the
mixture, beating constantly.  Use a wooden spoon and stir constantly, this
way and that, making certain that the spoon touches all over the bottom of
the saucepan.  If a thermometer is available, cook to 180 degrees and
remove from heat.  If a thermometer is not available, cook the sauce until
it becomes like a very thin custard. This cooking will rid the custard of
the raw taste of the yolks. Immediately pour and scrape the sauce into a
mixing bowl to prevent further cooking. Let cool. 4. Meanwhile, put the
water in a saucepan and add 1 cup sugar. Stir and bring to the boil. Simmer
10 minutes and remove from heat. Let cool. 5. Put the strawberries into the
container of a food processor or an electric blender and blend thoroughly.

1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon black walnut extract or 2 or 3 drps; almond extract
1 dash salt
1/2 cup finely chopped black walnut

SOURCE:  From Your Ice Cream Maker by Coleen and Bob Simmons, copyright

Combine all ingredients except nuts in a food processor or blender.

instructions for freezing.  About a minute before ice cream is frozen, add
nuts and continue freezing until ice cream is done.
PERSONAL NOTE from Ursula Taylor - fols on the NutraSweet sweetner - no
where in the book does it say whether to use the NutraSweet spoonful or the
Measure or to empty packets and use 5 tsp. Five and 1/2 tsp. of the Eqaul
measure is equal to 3/4 cup of sugar - so you can use that as a guide. Or
put in a small amount and blend it and then taste it - if not sweet enough
then add more to taste.

Superior Whipping Cream

deserts, ice cream

1/2 cup whipping cream
2 teaspoon vanilla sugar
1  or
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Shake the carton of whipping cream well and pour it into the blender or
food processor. Add the vanilla sugar (see below if you don't know what
vanilla sugar is.)

Whip the cream in the machine.  If it's a food processor, leave the pushing
device out; if a blender, remove the center of the lid, or just cover the
top of the jar with your hand. The trick is to allow lots of air into the
cream. Run the machine for no more than five seconds at a time, to avoid
making butter. The cream is done when it holds a peak.

NOTES:

*  A simple way to make whipped cream extra yummy -- There is almost no
dessert that can't be improved by adding a dollop of whipping cream.
Unfortunately, most people seem to be  afraid of actually whipping the
cream, so they buy the awful stuff that comes in a pressurized can, or
spend money on expensive devices to inject gas into the cream. (Or worse,
they use Cool Whip.) The truth is that making your own whipped cream is
trivial, with the appropriate mechanical aids. Yield: makes about 2 cups.

*  If you don't know what vanilla sugar is, don't panic.  My mother makes
this variation in a separate sugar container; fill the container with
sugar, add a vanilla bean and wait. After a week or two, the sugar will
take on the vanilla flavor. Use this sugar whenever a recipe calls for
sugar and vanilla extract; just remember to keep the container full.

*  If you don't have vanilla sugar around, use regular sugar and vanilla
extract for the cream.

Sweet Fried Cream (Crema Fritta)

deserts, ice cream

2 cup milk
6  egg yolks
6 tablespoon sugar
1  lemon, grated zest of
1/4 cup all purpose flour
1 1/2 cup very fine, dry unflavored breadcrum; bs
2  eggs, lightly beaten
1  oil for frying
1/3 cup powdered sugar

Servings: 6 to 8

DIRECTIONS: Bring milk to a boil in a medium saucepan. In a large
heavy saucepan off the heat, beat egg yolks, granulated sugar and
lemon zest until pale and thick. Beat in flour until well blended.
Very slowly pour in hot milk, beating constantly. Cook custard cream
over medium heat 5 to 8 minutes, beating constantly. Do not let boil.
Custard cream is done when it coats the back of a spoon. Moisten a
large plate or cookie sheet with water. Spread cooked cream to a
thickness of 1/2 to 1 inch. Cream can be prepared to this point a day
or two ahead. When cream is completely cooled, cut into squares or
diamonds. Place breadcrumbs in a shallow dish. Coat cream shapes with
breadcrumbs. Dip coated cream shapes into beaten eggs, and coat again
with breadcrumbs. Pour oil 2 inches deep in a large saucepan or
deep-fryer. Heat oil to 375-F (190-C) or until a 1-inch cube of bread
turns golden brown almost immediately. Using a slotted spoon, lower
cream pieces a few at a time into hot oil. Turn cream pieces. When
golden on both sides, remove from oil with slotted spoon. Drain on
paper towels. Arrange drained fried cream on a platter and sprinkle
with powdered sugar. Serve hot.

Tea & Lemon Ice

deserts, ice cream

1/2 pint strong fragrant tea *
2  lemons
8 oz sugar
1/2 pint water
1  egg white
6 tablespoon carbonated water

*Note: Suggested teas are Lapsang Souchong or Earl Grey.

In a Welsh household the kettle sits permanently on the hob ready to
refill the teapot.  This delicious ice makes a refreshing change in
summer. Or serve as a dessert with Welsh cakes or with a plate of
buttered Bara Brith. Makes approximately 2 pints.

Strain the tea and leave to cool.  Peel the lemons, avoiding the
bitter pith, and squeeze the juice. Bring the sugar and water to boil
with the lemon rind, stirring to dissolve all the sugar. Leave it to
cool. Beat the egg white lightly with the carbonated water. Mix all
the ingredients thoroughly with a whisk.

Freeze the mixture - an ice-cream-maker is best.  If you use the
ice-making compartment of the fridge, take it out when frozen, beat
it until it has doubled in volume, and re-freeze it. Don't serve the
ice rock-hard - transfer it to the fridge half an hour before serving.

The Ultimate Rice Pudding

deserts, ice cream, rice

3 cup milk
1/2 cup sugar
2 cup cooked rice
3 tablespoon butter
1 teaspoon vanilla

Combine milk, sugar, rice and butter in a sauce pan and simmer until
thick about 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla.
Serves 4, or 2 rice pudding freaks. You can use only half the amount
of sugar and substitute Half-and-half for the milk. In case a rice
pudding binge leads you to dieting, try the recipe with 1/4 cup of
sugar or granulated sugar substitute and skim milk or skim evaporated
milk. It is still super. It makes the best rice pudding for the least
effort of any we've tried. You may also try sprinkling 1/4 teaspoon
of nutmeg over the top when serving.

them.  Put mixing bowl into freezer until mixture is almost frozen, 30 - 40
minutes.  Divide into 4 equal portions and use at once. Or store frozen

vanilla, lemon juice, and remaining sugar until pale and thick, about

2/3 cup round or short-grain rice
3 cup milk
1/3 cup superfine or vanilla sugar =or=- mo; re to taste
1 tablespoon superfine or vanilla sugar
1  1/2 strip of orange zest
1 pinch salt
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1  egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract; or to taste
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice =or=- more to tas; te
1/3 cup rich cream (w/o crust); -or- heavy cream
      ----FOR SERVING----
1  ground cinnamon
1  confectioners' sugar; sifted

Place the rice in boiling water and leave for 5 seconds; drain, and
rinse. Bring the milk almost to a boil in a heavy saucepan, and stir
in the rice, the first quantity of sugar, the orange zest, salt, and
butter. Reduce the heat to very low and simmer uncovered, stirring
occasionally to prevent sticking, for 1 hour, or until thick and
creamy. Remove from the heat and set aside.

Whisk together the egg, vanilla, lemon juice, and remaining sugar
until pale and thick, about 2 minutes. Remove the orange zest from
the rice mixture and stir half the rice into the egg mixture. Return
this to the saucepan and stir to combine.  Gently cook over low heat,
stirring well, for 2 minutes.  Stir in the Rich Cream and add more
sugar or lemon juice if desired.  (If using heavy cream, beat until
slightly thickened, then stir into the rice mixture.)   Divide among
individual dishes and chill.

To serve, liberally dust with the cinnamon and confectioners' sugar.

Yoghurt Ice Cream

deserts, ice cream, barry

10 fl oz whole-milk plain yoghurt
4 oz your favourite fruit
1  sugar to taste

Dissolve a little sugar in water in a saucepan and add the fruit.
Simmer for 5 minutes until soft and then puree through a sieve. If
you have a food processor or liquidiser don't cook the fruit - just
whizz it to a puree, adding sugar, a teaspoon at a time, until it is
to your taste. Beat the puree into the yoghurt, pour into a plastic
container and put it in the freezer.

When it has set, take it out, spoon it back into the the food
processor or liquidiser and give it a quick whizz. This gets rid of
any little particles of ice that may have formed. If you don't have a
machine, spoon the mixture into a bowl and whisk it thoroughly. Pour
it back into the plastic container and freeze again.

When you're ready to eat it, leave it in the fridge for half an hour
before serving.
