           -London Broil - whatever
      3    Cloves garlic
           Salt

           Parsley
      2    Celery leaves, cut fine
      2 ts Basil
      2 ts Marjoram
      2 ts Thyme
           Ground pepper
     12 tb Olive oil (optional)
           Honey
 
  Combine all of the ingredients except honey and the meat. Spread the
  honey on the meat and then spread everything else on. Spray the
  baking pan or rack, and bake at 500 degrees (yes, 500 degrees) for
  30-35 minutes. For thinner cuts of meat, decrease time. (Use a meat
  thermometer if you are wishy washy)
  
  We used a thin cut when we got this recipe and left out the olive
  oil, but I think that if you where using a thick cut of beef you
  might need to put it back in.

      3 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Baking powder

      2 ts Cinnamon
      1 sm Box vanilla instant pudding
    1/2 c  Nuts; optional
      2 c  Zucchini; grated
 
  Mix sugar, eggs, oil and vanilla. Beat 2 minutes. Sift together flour,
  baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and dry pudding mix. Mix
  both mixtures together. Add nuts, if desired, and zucchini. Beat
  another 3 minutes. Pour into well-greased loaf pans and bake at 350
  for 50 minutes.
  
  For Muffins, bake at 400 for 20 to 25 minutes.
  
  Makes 24 muffins or 2 loaves.
  
  My notes: be sure to not to drain off the juice in the bottom of the
  food processor when you grate the zucchini, otherwise the batter is
  too stiff. If the batter is still not moist enough, add a bit of
  water.

 Categories: Condiments, French, Spreads, Restaurant/
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
       12 oz jar pitted green salad
  :          -olives -- drained
        1    shallot -- finely chopped
        1 ts fresh lemon juice
  :          freshly ground pepper
      1/2 c  olive oil
        1    handful chives -- chopped
  
  In a food processor or small mixer, combine olives, shallot, lemon
  juice, pepper and half of the olive oil. Add anchovies if desired.
  
  Pulse until mixture is a course paste consistency. Use more oil if
  necessary.  I like to vary the coarseness according to what I am
  going to serve.  A coarser consistency is good for vegetable crudites
  (a basket of green onions, fennel slices, cherry tomatoes). A
  smoother tapenade is good spread on thin slices of baguette, toasted,
  or thicker chunks of sourdough bread.  For a smoother tapenade, use
  all of the olive oil and blend until creamy and smooth.  Top with a
  sprinkling of chives and serve.

      Title: TAPIOCA SOUP
 Categories: Thai, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      5 c  Pork stock [Chicken works
           -just fine. S.C.]
    1/2 c  Minced or ground pork
      1 tb Chopped garlic
      3 tb Fish sauce
    1/2 c  Tapioca
    1/2 c  Cooked or canned crab meat
           Pepper

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
      4    Lettuce leaves, coarsely
           -chopped
     12    Coriander leaves
 
  Tapioca is a plant product made from the roots of the cassava plant-
  ~also called manioc.  It's a major product in Thailand and I saw
  "tapioca trees" all over the place. The plant itself isn't a tree,
  but they take the rootstocks and tie them into bundles which they set
  upright in the fields so they don't rot during the rainy season.
  Leaves sprout from the top of the bundle and the whole thing looks
  like a tree.  The root has a poisonous acid in it that has to be
  removed by cooking. Those little balls are actually made++like
  risotto or "rice pasta". It's usually used to make sweet puddings
  here, but in the Orient it's used to make thick, savory soups.  Like
  this one!
  
  Heat the stock to simmering in a large pan.  Pour 1/2 cup of the hot
  stock into a bowl and stir in the pork. Return mixture to the pan.
  Add the garlic and fish sauce to taste, then add the tapioca and cook
  for 5 to 10 minutes. When the tapioca is clear, add the crab meat and
  season to taste with pepper.  Remove from the heat. Line individual
  soup bowls with the lettuce. Pour in the soup and sprinkle with
  coriander leaves.
  
  From "Discover Thai Cooking" by Chaslin, Canungmai and Tettoni, Times
  Editions, Singapore.  1987.
  
  This is a simple, excellent soup and subject to all sorts of
  variations.

  3 3/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Fennel seeds -=OR=-
      2 ts Cracked black peppercorns
 
  Stir yeast into the warmed wine & let proof for 10 minutes. Stir in
  the olive oil & add then add the flour, salt, fennel/pepper. Mix
  until the dough comes together, knead on a lightly floured board for
  5 to 7 minutes, the presence of the olive oil should prevent it from
  sticking. Knead until the dough is smooth & responsive. Place in a
  lightly oiled bowl, cover & let rise until puffy but not doubled, 1
  to 1 1/4 hours. Break off ap iece of dough the size of a lime & roll
  it between your palms & fingers to form a rope 18" long & as thin as
  a breadstick. Let each one rest while you roll out the rest (about 12
  in all).  Cut each piece into 6" lengths & conect their ends to form
  rings about 2" in diameter. Press the ends together very firmly;
  pinch as tighly as necessary, the dough will recover. Set the rings
  on oiled baking sheets, cover & let rise for 1 hour. Preheat the oven
  to 350F & bring a pot of water to a boil. When risen, plunge the
  taralli into the boiling water, a few at a time, immersing them only
  until they bob to the surface. Remove with a slotted spoon & drain on
  paper towels. Let them cool slightly.  Bake on oiled baking sheets
  for about 20 to 24 minutes, until they are crunchy.

      5 oz Tarama (fish roe)
      1 c  Olive oil

  Soak the tarama in warm water a few minutes, then rinse and drain. If
  using bread slices, discard crusts, soak bread in water, then squeeze
  dry. Using an electric blender or electric mixer (or old-fashioned
  mortar and pestle), thoroughly blend the bread or potatoes and the
  tarama. Add the olive oil as slowly as possible, blending at medium
  speed, plus a little water if the mixture forms peaks. Add the grated
  onion, if desired, then whip at high speed for a few minutes. Note:
  The flavor may be mitigated to suit taste by adding more bread or
  potato; a too-salty taste may be adjusted by dropping in a few
  tablespoons of sour cream while blending. Leftover taramasalata can
  be stored in a covered jar in the refrigerator for 7 to 10 days.

           The only tricky bit comes
           -in adding
 
  the oil: you should do it a little at a time like preparing
  mayonnaise, and be careful not to let the oil separate. If it does
  begin to separate, add another dash of lemon juice. Taramosalata will

      Title: TARANTULAS
 Categories: None
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1    Tarantula
 
  Awhile back I mentioned that I thought that it odd that nobody eats
  tarantulas because of their close relationship to crabs and the
  like--favorite foods in many cuisines. Last night I was watching a
  show on a tribe of Amazonian Indians and lo and behold, they were
  trapping and cooking the big ol' spiders. And I do mean big. These
  guys were the size of blue crabs. I would guess that they're at least
  eight inches across the spread legs.
  
  "Take one tarantula..." Not an easy process! First they catch the
  critters by luring them out of their tunnels with a long strip of
  grass. The hunter then very deftly grabs the spider by the thorax,
  folds the legs back and wraps the spider in a leaf for transportation
  to the camp site.
  
  At the campsite, the spiders are killed. Everything is used. The
  abdomens are removed and stripped of eggs. The eggs are wrapped in a
  leaf and roasted over a fire to produce a spider egg omelette. The
  bodies are tossed directly onto a fire to singe off the hair and to
  cook the meat. When they're done, the legs and thorax are cracked
  open and picked just like when you eat a crab. After the meal the
  fangs--which are a good inch and a half long-- are used as
  toothpicks. It was emphasized that the spiders taste *very* much like
  crab.

 Categories: Soups, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Dry red kidney beans (1 1/4
           -cups)
      2    Sprigs epazote, finely
           -chopped (Optional) *
      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Toasted ** dry oregano
    1/2 lg White onion, sliced
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 lb Roma tomatoes
      2    Cloves roasted *** garlic
      2 tb Pureed chipotles in adobo
           -(see recipe)
      2    Pasilla de Oaxaca chilies
           -(or anchos or mulatos),
           Stemmed
    1/2 c  Peanut oil
      3 oz Monterey Jack cheese cut
           -into 4 slices.
 
  "This soup's hearty nature is appropriate, given the legendary
  fierceness of the Tarascan Indians of Michoacan, with whom the dish
  originated. The Tarascan civilization of the 14 th and 15th centuries
  was one of the few that was never conquered by the Aztecs, and was
  one of the last in Mexico to fall to the Spanish conquistadores.
  
  * This herb might be found at Hispanic markets. ** Toast oregano by
  quickly stirring it in a hot, dry skillet for about 1 minute. ***
  Roast the garlic by wrapping it in foil and slowly baking it in a 300
  F oven for about 25 minutes.
  
  Place the beans in a saucepan with the epazote, salt and oregano. Add
  enough water to cover the beans. Cover the pan and bring to a boil.
  Reduce to a simmer, and cook for about 1 1/2 hours or until the beans
  are soft, stirring occasionally.  Add more water as necessary.
  
  Saute the onions briefly in the olive oil.  Cut the tomatoes in half
  and remove the seeds.  Place the tomato halves on a baking sheet and
  roast in a 350 F oven for 45 minutes (this intensifies their flavor).
  Transfer the tomatoes to a blender, add the cooked beans, onions and
  chipotle puree, and blend.  Add a little water if it seems too thick.
  Put the pureed mixture through a medium-mesh or fine-mesh sieve or
  pass it through a food mill, to remove seeds and skins.
  
  Transfer the soup to a saucepan and heat over low heat. Meanwhile,
  lightly fry the chilies in the peanut oil for a few seconds, just
  until softened, and then cut into strips. Add the slices of cheese
  and the chili strips to the soup and season with salt to taste. When
  the cheese has melted, ladle the soup into bowls and serve.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: TARRAGON GAME HENS
 Categories: Poultry, Herbs
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Cornish game hens
      6 tb Butter, at room
           -temperature
      2 tb Lemon juice
      2 tb Tarragon, dried
           -(or about 1 T
           -fresh tarragon)
    1/8 ts Salt
 
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Prepare the hens by rinsing
  thoroughly, checking for pin feathers and patting dry. Be sure to
  remove yellow fat found at the cavity opening.
  
  Gently separate the skin from the flesh by sliding your fingers
  between and tearing the connecting membrane. It is easiest to begin
  at the cavity opening and work up the breast. Leave skin attached at
  the lower two-thirds of the wings and base of the legs. Work
  carefully over the breastbone area so as not to tear the skin which
  is firmly attached at this point.
  
  Thoroughly blend the butter, lemon juice, tarragon and salt. If the
  butter is not soft, it will be difficult to incorporate the lemon
  juice.
  
  Using your fingers, spread a layer of herb butter under the loosened
  skin of each hen. Spread a small amount on the skin. Tuck wings under
  the back of the hen and set each hen on its side, breast down on a
  roasting rack over a roasting pan.
  
  Roast for 15 minutes, then turn hens to other side. Roast for another
  15 minutes, then set hens on their backs with breast up and roast for
  a final 15 minutes (total cooking time about 45 minutes). Each time
  the hens are turned, baste by spooning pan juices over the bird. Hens
  are fully cooked when juices run clear and drumstick moves easily in
  its socket.
  
  Remove birds to a warm platter and let sit for 5 minutes. Reduce pan
  juices to a thin glaze consistency over high heat and serve as a
  sauce. (You may want to flavor the pan juices with a little dry white
  wine.) Quarter birds before serving. Each bird should serve two
  people.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cornish game hens basted in tarragon butter -- This method of
  "basting" fowl by spreading an herb butter under the skin infuses the
  meat with the flavor of the herbs which usually is kept on the skin
  with normal external basting.
  
  *  This basting method can also be used when grilling, either over a
  barbecue or in the broiler. I prefer barbecuing to oven roasting in
  the summer (I tend to roast along with the birds) and prepare the
  birds a little differently in this case. Rather than grilling whole,
  before the butter is spread under the skin, each bird is split along
  the spine using a sharp heavy knife. This is quite easy since the
  spine and ribs are easily cut with moderately heavy pressure and
  rocking motion on the knife blade. I then spread the bird, breast up,
  and crack the breast bone to flatten with a sharp blow on the breast
  with the heel of my hand. The wings are tucked under themselves and
  the legs and thighs left loose. The birds can be cooked ahead of time
  and taken on a picnic or prepped in advance and grilled at the picnic.
  
  *  Margarine may be substituted for the butter without major
  noticeable effects on the flavor.
  
  *  In the summer, I like to serve either a tabbouleh or Italian tomato
  salad (quartered RIPE tomatoes sprinkled with chopped fresh basil and
  drizzled with olive oil) and a white zinfadel.
  
  *  Since I like herb butters with all kinds of fish and fowl and have
  an herb garden, I generally make up 2 cups or more of herb butter at
  a time, using a food processor to assure thorough blending. The
  butter keeps well in the fridge for 2-3 weeks.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 lb Leg of lamb
    2/3 c  Cream

  1 1/4 c  Dry white wine
      1 tb Oil
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1    Onion sliced
 
  Skin  the  leg of lamb and trim away all the outside fat and as much
  of the fat lying between the muscle tissue that you can reach. Score
  the flesh deeply with a criss-cross pattern and stuff the slits with
  the tarragon. Rub the meat with the oil and cover with the onion.
  Place in a suitable dish for marinating and pour over the white wine.
  Add a little salt and pepper and leave to marinate for about 2 hours
  in a cool place, basting occasionally.  Roast the lamb with the
  marinade, basting it frequently, in a warm oven 325 deg F until done.
   About 10 minutes before the meat is cooked,  pour off the marinade
  and meat juices into a saucepan. Reduce the gravy to half its
  original quantity  by  boiling vigorously. Carve the meat into thin
  slices and add the resulting juices to the marinade. Arrange the meat
  on a serving dish  and  keep warm.   Remove the gravy from the heat,
  stir in cream and carefully re- heat the sauce until it forms a
  medium-thick consistency. Pour the sauce over the lamb and keep warm.

           Raw rice for weighting shell
           -
      5 lg Eggs
    3/4 c  Sugar
      3 tb Lemon zest
      3 c  Lemon juice
 
  Roll out half the dough 1/8-inch thick on a floured surface. Press it
  firmly into an 8-inch tart pan with a removable fluted rim. Trim off
  excess dough, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang. Fold the overhang back
  inside the rim, pressing it to the side of the shell, and push the
  dough up 1/4-inch above the edge of the pan. Crimp the edge
  decoratively with a fork. Roll out remaining dough and make up
  another tart shell in the same manner.
  
  Chill the shells for 60 minutes.  Line the shells with foil, fill the
  foil with rice and bake in the lower third of a preheated 400f oven
  for 8 minutes.  Remove the rice and foil, and bake for 8-10 minutes
  more or until they are pale golden.  Remove shells from the pans,
  transfer them to a rack and let them cool.
  
  In a bowl with an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks with 1/2 cup
  sugar until the mixture is thick and pale and forms a ribbon. Beat in
  the zest and lemon juice. Transfer the mixture to a heavy saucepan.
  Cook it, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, over mod-low heat,
  until it registers 140f on a candy thermometer. Continue to cook at a
  stable 140f for 3 minutes longer. Do not let it boil. Transfer the
  mixture to a bowl, and let it cool, covered with a buttered round of
  wax paper, until it is luke-warm.
  
  In a bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they hold
  soft peaks.  Add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, one Tbsp at a time, and
  beat the meringue until it just hold stiff peaks. Stir a quarter of
  the meringue into the lemon mixture and fold in the remaining
  meringue gently but thoroughly.
  
  Transfer the tart shells to a baking sheet and fill with the lemon
  mixture, mounding it slightly.  Bake the tarts in the middle of a
  preheated 400f oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the tops are golden
  and puffed. Transfer the tarts to a rack and let them cool.

      Title: TARTE AU RAISINE  (VAUD)
 Categories: Tarts, Swiss
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    250 g  Sweet flan pastry
           Butter; for the tart tin
           Flour; for the tart tin

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      3    Eggs
      1    Egg yolk
  1 1/2 dl DOUBLE cream
      1 dl Rasine; see notes
 
  (Units: 100 g = 3 1/2 oz; 1 dl = 3 1/2 fl oz = 2/5 cup; 180 oC = 350
  oF; 200 oC = 400 oF; 230 oC = 450 oF; 250 oC = 475 oF; 2.5 cm = 1
  inch)
  
  Raisine (with an 'e accent aigu' !): this is an old 'vaudois' country
  recipe. In the autumn, on farms all over the region, the juice of
  apples and pears is reduced very slowly, for 48 hours, in large
  cauldrons to make our 'raisine'.
  
  I don't know a substitute for raisine, which is a thick, dark brown
  concentrate of fruit juices. The taste: fruity sweet and slightly
  sour. It is sold locally in the markets, but not often in shops.
  
  Pre-heat the oven to 260 oC. Butter and flour a 20 cm (8 in) tart
  ring, or a tart tin with a removable base, and line it with the
  pastry. Protect the pastry with a disc of aluminium foil pressed well
  against the edges and over the rim.
  
  Blind-bake the pastry for about 10 to 15 minutes. Leave it to cool in
  the tin.
  
  Reduce the oven temperature to 180 oC.
  
  Prepare the filling by whisking together the remaining ingredients
  (it may be necessary to increase the quantity of raisine by 1
  tablespoon, but this depends on the degree to which it was reduced
  when it was made).
  
  Partly fill the pastry shell, then put it into the oven and complete
  the filling by spooning in the rest of the mixture - it must fill the
  shell to the brim and this way there is no danger of spilling it when
  you put it in the oven.
  
  Leave the oven door ajar until the filling is set: this should take
  about half an hour. Test its firmness by giving the tart tin a little
  shake.
  
  When the tart is cooked, take it out of the oven. Allow it to cool a
  little then take it out of the tin and leave it to get quite cold on
  a cake rack.

 Categories: Desserts, France
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------PATE BRISEE-----------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Unbleached white flour
      2 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Butter; chilled
           -- cut into small pieces
      1    Egg yolk
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
      1 tb -Cold water, more if needed

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      5 c  Fresh or frozen blueberries
      2 tb -Water
    1/3 c  Sugar
      1 tb Cornstarch; dissolved in:
      2 ts -Water

MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
    1/2 pt Heavy cream; whipped
 
  FOR THE PATE BRISEE, stir the flour and sugar together in a mixing
  bowl. Cut the chilled butter into small pieces and drop into the
  flour. With your fingers, lightly and quickly rub the butter and
  flour together until the mixture becomes crumbly, or cut it in with a
  knife or pastry cutter. Whisk together the egg yolk, lemon juice, and
  1 tablespoon of water. Sprinkle the liquid over the butter-flour
  mixture and continue to stir or rub this mixture between your fingers
  until a ball of dough forms. Be careful not to overwork the dough. If
  the mixture is crumbly, add up to one more tablespoon water,
  sprinkling it over the dough and lightly kneading it into a ball.
  
  On a floured board and with a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough
  into a large circle.  Gently lift it into a 9- or 10-inch pie plate
  or tart tin. Patch any holes in the crust with bits of dough and trim
  the edges. Flute the crust.  Chill for 2 hours.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375 F.
  
  Place a sheet of aluminum foil in the bottom of the crust and fill it
  with dried beans or rice to weigh it down during baking. Bake for 15
  minutes. Remove the crust from the oven and carefully lift out the
  foil and beans. Bake for 5 minutes more.  Cool.
  
  TO MAKE THE FILLING, heat in a small saucepan 2 cups of the
  blueberries, 2 tablespoons of water, and the sugar. Crush a few
  berries with a spoon to release the juice. When the berries have
  softened and become juicy, add the cornstarch mixture.  Simmer on low
  heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture
  thickens. Remove it from the heat and fold in one more cup of
  blueberries. Pour the berry mixture into the baked pie shell.  Top
  with remaining 2 cups blueberries. Cool for at least one hour.
  
  Serve plain or topped with fresh whipped cream, if desired, or
  sweetened Creme Fraiche.

 Categories: Tarts, Fruits
      Yield: 1 Tart
 
    350 g  Rough Puff Pastry

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 kg Apples; Golden Delicious
           - or Granny Smith
      3 tb Lemon juice
      2 tb Butter; unsalted
     50 g  Sugar

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
      2    Eggs
    100 g  Sugar
      6 tb Butter; unsalted, melted
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  (350 g = 12.5 ounces; 1 kg = 2 pounds; 50 g = 1 3/4 ounces)
  
  On a lightly floured surface, carefully roll out the dough to a
  12-inch (30 cm) circle.
  
  Transfer the dough to a 10 1/2-inch (27 cm) black tin tart pan with a
  removable bottom.
  
  Carefully press the pastry into the pan and up the sides, trying not
  to stretch it.
  
  Trim the overhang, leaving about a 1-inch (2.5 cm) extending over the
  rim.
  
  Tuck this overhang inside the pan, pressing gently against the side to
  create a sturdy, double-sided shell.
  
  (If you build the pastry a bit higher than the height of the pan, you
  will have less problem with shrinkage)
  
  Chill for at least 20 minutes.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375 oF (190 oC).
  
  Prick the bottom of the shell with the tines of a fork. Carefully
  line the shell loosely with heavy-duty foil, pressing well into the
  edges so the pastry does not shrink while baking.
  
  Fill with pie weights, or dry rice or beans - making sure you get all
  the way into the edges - to prevent shrinkage.
  
  Bake just until the pastry begins to brown around the edges and seems
  firm enough to stand up by itself (about 20 minutes).
  
  Meanwhile, peel and core the apples. Cut each apple into 12 even
  wedges. Toss them in a bowl with the lemon juice to prevent
  discoloration.
  
  In a Iarge skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the
  apples, sprinkle on the sugar, and saute, shaking the pan from time
  to time so the apples cook evenly.
  
  Cook until lightly browned on all sides (about 15 minutes.)
  
  While the apples cook, prepare the topping: beat the eggs and sugar
  thoroughly until thick and pale. Add the melted butter and vanilla and
  continue mixing at high speed until the ingredients are thoroughly
  incorporated.
  
  Spoon the apples into the center of the prepared pastry shell,
  arranging them carefully. Pour the topping over the apples.
  
  Bake until golden, about 30 minutes.

    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 lb Granny Smith apples, peeled,
           -cored, and cut into 1/8ths
 
  Pastry Dough
  
  1. Make the pastry dough: in a food processor, pulse the flour and
  sugar together to combine. Add the butter and pulse until coarse
  crumbs form. Add the water, 1 tbsp at a time, pulsing just until the
  dough comes together. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface
  and gather it into a ball. Pat into a disk, wrap tightly in plastic
  wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 20 minutes.
  
  2. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a 10",
  circle, about 1/4" thick. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured
  baking sheet, cover and refrigerate.
  
  3. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Melt the butter in a 9" cast-iron
  skillet. Add the sugar and cook over moderately high heat, stirring,
  until a rich brown caramel forms, about 5 minutes. Remove from the
  heat. Pack the apple pieces in the skillet, rounded sides down but
  slightly leaning, in concentric circles.
  
  4. Lay the pastry round on top of the apples, pressing gently to fit
  it in the pan. Bake the tart for about 35 minutes, or until the
  pastry is golden brown. Let cool slightly, then carefully invert the
  pan on a warm serving plate. Serve the tart warm or at least room
  temperature accompanied by the Cinnamon Ice Cream.

 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    300 g  Puff pastry (2/3 lb
    200 g  Sugar (7 oz)
    100 g  Butter (3 1/2 oz)
      2 kg Apples (4 3/8 lb), peeled,
           -- cored, cuted in halves
 
  For a 26 cm (10.2 in) diameter pie form
  
  Roll out the pastry ( 2 mm, 1/10 in, thick) to a 30 cm (11.8 in) disc
  and leave it to rest in the refrigerator.
  
  Pre-heat the oven to 220 oC (435 oF).
  
  Butter a 26cm-diameter disc of baking parchment and carefully line
  the base of the tin with it. Spread the sugar over the paper, shaking
  it evenly over the surface, place in the middle of the oven and bake
  for some 8 minutes to caramelize the sugar. Keep care !! Caramelize
  to light golden brown !! Then add the butter, let it melt, tttooto
  and leave to cool a little.
  
  (You can try without baking parchment: it's difficult to unmold !!)
  
  Place the halved apples vertically side by side (i.e. they MUST be
  higher than the rim of the tin !). Bake for some 25 minutes (at the
  same temperature), tttooto.
  
  'Line' (i.e. cover) the apples with the pastry disc . Bake for 20 ...
  25 minutes (at the same temperature), tttooto.
  
  Let cool 5 minutes on a rack, then turn over and unmold the 'tarte
  tatin' on a plate, remove the baking parchment.
  
  The 'tarte tatin' look now like an apple pie :-)
  
  Serving: warm or lukewarm with 'creme chantilly'
  
  (tttooto = take the tin out of the oven !!)

  Spoon bread, or batter bread, is a custardy corn bread served souffle
  hot from the dish, preferably earthenware, in which it is baked. It
  is said that the recipe just happened when a mixture used to make a
  corn bread enriched by milk and eggs was left forgotten in a hot
  oven.  Virginians have ever since made spoon bread one of their
  favored foods.  It is excellent served with herring roe, bacon, or
  fried apples. _______________________________________________________

 Categories: Wild game
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Pheasants, about 2 1/2 lb ea
      2    Oranges; halved
    1/4 c  Olive oil
           Salt to taste
           Pepper to taste
      8    Sprigs flat-leaf parsley
      4    Garlic cloves; peeled and
           -bruised
      2    Bay leaves
     12 sl Bacon
    1/2 c  Defatted chicken broth
    1/4 c  Tawny port
           Autumn Pear Salsa (see
           -separate recipe)
 
  When cooking pheasant or any wild game birds, I always squeeze an
  orange or two in the cavity and on the outside to refresh the bird
  before cooking. As the meat is very lean, it's necessary to cover the
  breast with bacon to add extra moisture during roasting. Basting with
  liquid from the pan also is essential. - Shiela Lukins
  
  1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  2. Rinse the pheasants, cleaning the cavities well. Remove any excess
  fat. Pat dry.
  
  3. Squeeze the oranges all over the birds and inside the cavities.
  Brush with olive oil and sprinkle inside and out with salt and
  pepper. Place 4 sprigs of parsley, 2 cloves of garlic and a bay leaf
  in each cavity.
  
  4. Place the birds in a shallow roasting pan to fit. Arrange 6 slices
  of bacon over each pheasant.  Add the chicken broth and the port to
  the pan.
  
  5. Bake for 1 1/2 hours (remove the bacon after an hour), basting two
  or three times.  Then bake 15-20 minutes longer or until the breasts
  are brown and the birds are cooked through. (The juices should run
  clear when the thickest part of the thigh is tested with the tip of a
  knife.) Let rest 10 minutes. Carve and serve with Autumn Pear Salsa.

 Categories: Poultry, Chinese
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 lb Chicken, fresh killed
  2 1/2 tb Salt, kosher
      2 tb Peppercorns, Szechuan,
    1/2 ts Ginger, minced
      2 ts Zest, orange, minced
      2 md Scallions, 3" lengths

      3    Star anise, whole
    1/8 c  Bark, cassia
      7 sl Peel, orange **
  1 1/2 ts Oil, sesame

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
    1/2 lb Onion, red, firm
  6 1/2 tb Vinegar, rice, unseasoned
  3 1/2 tb Sugar
    1/8 ts Chili, red, flakes, dry
    1/8 ts Peppercorns, Szechuan,
      3    Garlic, cloves, minced
           Ma-La Cucumber Fans ***
 
       ** Remove the peel from fresh oranges, slice into finger
  lengths, and allow to dry on a counter until curled.
  
       *** See recipe for Ma-La Cucumber Fans.
  
       Remove the kidneys nestled to either side of the chicken tail
  bone, then flush the chicken with cold water inside and out - then
  pat dry.
  
       Heat the salt and peppercorns in a dry skillet over a medium-low
  heat, stirring constantly, until salt turns off white and peppercorns
  are very fragrant, about 3 minutes.
  
       Grind the hot mixture to a powder in a food processor or mortar,
  then sieve to remove peppercorn husks. Rub pepper-salt, ginger, and
  orange peel over the outside and inside of the chicken. Put the
  chicken, breast-side up in a heat-proof pie plate, and cover with
  plastic film. Set aside for 24 hours at room temperature or up to 48
  hours in the refrigerator.
  
       Drain the marinating juices. Smash the scallion lengths and
  ginger coins to release the juices, then array on top of the chicken
  and in the cavity.  Steam for 30 minutes over medium-high heat.
  
       Let the chicken rest in the steamer an additional 5 minutes
  before removing the lid.  Drain the steaming juices. (These can be
  strained, chilled, and used to make sauces and season soups and
  stir-frys.) Remove the scallion and ginger.
  
       Line an old wok and lid with super heavy-duty tin foil. Combine
  the tea, sugar, rice, peppercorns, anise, cassia bark and dried
  orange peel, and scatter in the bottom of the lined wok. Place the
  chicken breast side up on the oiled smoking rack in the wok set above
  spices. Turn heat to high, wait until smoke sends up several thick
  plumes, then cover wok and crimp foil shut to contain the smoke.
  
       Smoke the chicken over medium-high heat, for 12 minutes, then
  turn off the heat and let the chicken rest in the sealed wok for 7
  minutes.
  
       Remove the bird, brush with sesame oil, then chop into pieces
  with a thick-bladed cleaver designed to cut through bones. Garnish
  the smoked chicken with Hunan Red Onion Pickles. Use Ma-La Cucumber
  Fans as a side dish.
  
  Garnish: ========
  
       Remove the tips and the peels of your onions. Cut evenly into
  rings 3/8-inch thick.  Separate the rings, removing any loose inner
  membranes.
  
       Combine the vinegar, 3 tablespoons of sugar, chili, peppercorns,
  and garlic in a heavy, non-aluminum saucepan. Stir over moderate heat
  to dissolve sugar, then simmer for three minutes. Taste and adjust if
  needed with remaining sugar to balance sweet, tart, and spicy flavors.
  
       Add onion rings, then toss with chopsticks until onion wilts and
  liquid regains simmer, three to four minutes. Scrape mixture into a
  shallow bowl and refrigerate.
  
       Before serving, remove any loose onion membranes and most of the
  peppercorns.

      Title: TEA & LEMON ICE
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 pt Strong fragrant tea *
      2    Lemons
      8 oz Sugar
    1/2 pt Water
      1    Egg white
      6 tb Carbonated water
 
  *Note: Suggested teas are Lapsang Souchong or Earl Grey.
  
  In a Welsh household the kettle sits permanently on the hob ready to
  refill the teapot.  This delicious ice makes a refreshing change in
  summer. Or serve as a dessert with Welsh cakes or with a plate of
  buttered Bara Brith. Makes approximately 2 pints.
  
  Strain the tea and leave to cool.  Peel the lemons, avoiding the
  bitter pith, and squeeze the juice. Bring the sugar and water to boil
  with the lemon rind, stirring to dissolve all the sugar. Leave it to
  cool. Beat the egg white lightly with the carbonated water. Mix all
  the ingredients thoroughly with a whisk.
  
  Freeze the mixture - an ice-cream-maker is best.  If you use the
  ice-making compartment of the fridge, take it out when frozen, beat
  it until it has doubled in volume, and re-freeze it. Don't serve the
  ice rock-hard - transfer it to the fridge half an hour before serving.

      Title: TEA SMOKED DUCK
 Categories: Chinese, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      4 lb To 5 lb. duck, washed and
           -dried
      6 tb Reduced-sodium soy sauce
      4    Whole pieces star anise
      1    Cinnamon stick
      1 c  Uncooked long-grain white
           -rice
      1 c  Strong black tea leaves,
           -such as Darjeeling
      1 c  Brown sugar
      1 ts Toasted sesame oil
 
  The Chinese method of home smoking is surprisingly easy and eliminates
  duck's fattiness while preserving its flavor. Serve tea-smoked duck
  as an appetizer at room temperature with toothpicks, or use the meat
  in stir-fries.
  
  Remove any fat from the cavity of the duck and prick the bird all
  over. Bring an inch or two of water and 4 Tbsp. soy sauce to a boil
  in a wok with a tight-fitting lid. Add star anise and cinnamon. Place
  the duck on a rack in the wok, cover and steam over simmering water
  just until the juices run clear, about
       40    minutes.
  
  Remove the duck from the wok, pouring out any juice from the cavity,
  and set the bird aside. Discard liquid, rinse the wok and dry it with
  paper towels. Line it with heavy aluminum foil, allowing foil to hang
  about 2" over the edge. Place rice, tea and sugar in the bottom of
  the wok and mix well. Place a rack about 1 inch above the rice
  mixture. (If you do not have a rack that fits properly, place four
  chopsticks across the wok so that they crisscross.) Place the duck on
  the rack, breast-side up. Cover with foil, allowing at least 1 inch
  between the duck and foil and letting the foil cover also hang about
  2 inches over the edge. Cover with the lid.
  
  Turn heat to high (turn on exhaust fan) and cook until smoke begins to
  emerge from the wok, 3 to 5 minutes. Crimp the top and bottom edges
  of the overhanging foil together and smoke for 10 minutes. Reduce
  heat to medium and smoke for 20 minutes longer. Turn off heat and,
  leaving foil sealed, let sit for 15 minutes. Unwrap duck and discard
  tea mixture and aluminum foil. (The duck can be smoked up to 2 days
  ahead and stored, well covered, in the refrigerator. Bring to room
  temperature before serving)
  
  Remove and discard skin. Carve the breast meat into thin slices. Cut
  the legs from the carcass (discard carcass) and separate the thigh
  from the drumstick at the joint. Mix remaining 2 Tbsp. soy sauce and
  sesame oil and brush over the meat. Makes about 1/2 lb. cooked meat.
  
  Serves 4 as an appetizer.

           -equivalent in pieces
 
  * or 2 Cornish game hens, about 1 1/2 pounds each (see note)
  
  Remove fat from duck or hens and discard. Rinse thoroughly with cold
  water. With the palm of your hands press down on the breastbone to
  snap the bone and flatten the bird. Pat dry.
  
  Marinating: In an ungreased skillet or wok over medium heat, toast the
  peppercorns and salt until the salt turns a tan color and the
  peppercorns are aromatic, about 5 minutes. Finely grind in a food
  processor or spice mill and combine with sugar, ginger, onions and
  wine. Rub mixture throughout the duck or hens inside and out and
  place in a shallow heat-proof bowl (select one that will fit
  comfortably into the wok or pot that you will steam in). Cover and
  marinate overnight or up to 3 days, refrigerated. Turn every few
  hours, Remove from the refrigerator. Let the duck or hens come to
  room temperature.
  
  Steaming: Fill the bottom of wok or steaming pot with boiling water.
  Place bowl with the duck or hens and marinade on a rack over the
  water. Cover and steam 1 1/2 hours for duck, 45 minutes for hens.
  
  At 15-minute intervals, check water level and replenish with more
  water if needed. Remove hens with their bowl. Cool. Transfer duck or
  hens to a cooling rack; scrape off marinade. (Save duck stock. It
  makes a delicious cooking stock for vegetables.) Set hens in a cool,
  airy spot to dry for at least 4 hours, or refrigerate, overnight,
  uncovered,
  
  Smoking: Line bottom of a wok with heavy-duty aluminum foil. Mix
  together and distribute smoking materials on the bottom. Set a 9 or
  10-inch round cake rack into the wok or devise a rack by
  crisscrossing 6 wooden chopsticks in the middle of the wok. Place
  duck or hens directly on rack. Turn heat to medium-high. When the
  smoke begins, cover the wok and smoke for 10 to 20 minutes, or until
  duck or hens turn golden brown. Remove from rack and brush lightly
  with sesame oil. The hens may be served at this point or browned.
  
  Browning: Place hens breast side up on a roasting rack in a 425
  degree F. oven for 5 to 10 minutes to crisp the skin.
  
  Serving: Chop duck or hens into bite-size pieces, or remove bones and
  cut meat into thin slices. Serve with Lotus buns and accompaniments.
  
  Note: If you are preparing more than 2 hens, you will need to steam
  and smoke them in 2 batches.

      Title: TEA-SMOKED CHICKEN WINGS
 Categories: Appetizers, Poultry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 lb Chicken wings; (16 wings)
      3    Cl Garlic
      1 tb Ginger root; grated
      1 tb Honey
    3/4 c  Soy sauce
    1/2 c  Sherry
      1 c  Brown sugar
      1 c  Lapsang souchong tea; (loose
           Sesame seeds; for garnish
 
  Recipe by: The Tea Book by Sara Perry and Judith Ann Rose
      1. Using a knife, separate the mini drumstick end of the wing and
         slice through between the joints. Cut the wing tip off and
         discard. (any good butcher will dot his for you.) Wash the
  chicken
         thoroughly and pat dry.
  
      2. Using the metal blade of your processor, finely chop the
  garlic.
         Add the grated ginger root, honey, soy sauce, and sherry,
         processing for 20 to 30 seconds to blend. Pour the marinade in
  a
         9-by-13-inch baking pan, and add the chicken wings. With a
  spoon,
         drizzle the marinade over all the wings. Cover and refrigerate
  for
         at least 2 hours, rotating the chicken wings at least once.
  
      3. To smoke the chicken, choose a heavy steel or cast iron
  roasting
         pan or skillet with a tight fitting lid. Line the bottom of the
         pan with heavy duty aluminum foil. Sprinkle the brown sugar and
         tea on top of the foil. Place a cake rack in the skillet, over
  the
         sugar and tea mixture, and arrange the chicken wings on the
  rack.
         Cover the pan or skillet with a lid (or heavy aluminum foil if
  the
         lid does not fit snugly). Turn on your kitchen exhaust fan.
  Turn
         the burner on high, and leave chicken on high heat for 30
  minutes
         (see Note). Do not remove the lid to check. Turn off the heat
         after 30 minutes, and keep the chicken covered another 20
  minutes.
         Smoked chicken will keep for several days if well-wrapped and
         refrigerated.
  
     Serves 6 to 8 as an appetizer.
  
     Note: As with any recipe requiring a dish to be cooked at high
  heat,
     use caution. Since this dish does produce smoke, it is imperative
  to
     use your kitchen exhaust fan, and to have a pan or skillet with a
     tight fitting lid.
  
     NOTES:
  
     Smoking with tea is a traditional Chinese approach to preparing
     chicken. To the Western eye, the darkened skin resembles
  Cajun-style
     cuisine. These flavorful, bite-size chicken wings make a delicious
     appetizer when served plain, or with your favorite mustard, peanut
  or
     teriyaki sauce.

      Title: TEA-SMOKED GAME HEN
 Categories: Chinese, Game hens, Poultry
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Game hen
           Salt; to taste
           Freshly ground black -
           Pepper; to taste
      2 tb Chinese rice wine OR
           Dry sherry
      2 tb Sesame oil
      3 tb Jasmine tea leaves
      4 tb Alder or hickory sawdust
      6 c  Peanut oil; for deep-frying
 
     Cut the bird in half, using poultry shears or a Chinese cleaver.
     Rub the halves with salt and pepper, wine and sesame oil. Allow to
  marinate for 2 hours.
     Dip the halves into boiling water for 1 minute. Remove and place
  on a rack for drying.
     Smoke the halves in a Cameron stove-top smoker for 15 minutes,
  using the tea leaves and the alder or hickory sawdust.
     Place the halves on a plate and steam in a bamboo steamer for 20
  minutes.  Allow the pieces to cook, then deep-fry in hot peanut oil
  at 375 degrees until golden brown and crispy, about 4 to 5 minutes.
     This recipe serves 3 to 4 as part of a Chinese meal.
  
    Comments:  The game hen is a relatively recent bird, a development
  of modern agricultural science. However, in old China similar birds
  were common and this method of cooking remains a classic.

      3 tb Tamari soy sauce
           Juice of 1/2 lime
      1 ts Brown sugar
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      3 cl Garlic; minced

           - and thinly sliced

MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE SAUCE----------------------------
    2/3 c  Low-fat yogurt
    1/2 sm Cucumber; peeled, seeded,
           And finely diced (1/3c)
    1/4 ts Ground cumin
      1 tb Minced fresh parsley

MMMMM--------------------------TO SERVE-------------------------------
      8    8" flour tortillas
 
  Combine the marinade ingredients in a large bowl. Stir in the tempeh,
  bell peppers and onion.  Marinate at least 30 minutes or up to 2
  hours. Preheat oven to 450 F. In a small bowl combine the salsa
  ingredients. Cover and chill until ready to use. Sprinkle a little
  water on each tortilla and rub it into each tortilla with your
  fingers. Stack the tortillas, then wrap in foil.  Set aside. Spread
  the marinated tempeh and vegetables on a baking sheet in one layer.
  Bake 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender anfd tempeh
  begins to brown. So not toss while cooking. Place the tortilla packet
  in the oven for about 7 minutes. This will heat the tortillas with a
  little steam to soften them. To serve, place a tortilla on each
  plate. Spoon some of the tempeh mixture along the center, cover with
  a little cucumber salsa, then fold and roll to enclose the filling.

      Title: TEMPEH SANDWICH
 Categories: Appetizers, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Piece tempeh -- about the
           Size of a
           Oil
      1 ts Soy sauce
           Chopped onions and
           Mushrooms
      2 sl Bread
           Mayo or the equivalent
           Tomato slices/other raw
           Veggies as desired
 
  1.  (I usually use 2 pans (because I add an egg) but you can make
  this with one.) Heat oil in pans, saute onions and mushrooms, put
  aside when done.
  
  2.  Fry tempeh on both sides. When nearly done, add a teaspoon or so
  of soy sauce to each side and turn over to cook (it will splatter).
  
  3.  While this is all cooking (and try to time it to all come out at
  the same time), toast your bread and spread liberally with mayo (any
  variety), spaghetti sauce or something gooey.
  
  4.  Construct a sandwich with bread, tempeh, tomato, onion/mushroom
  mixture, and other veggies (optional). Serve hot.
  
  Author's Notes: Here is one of my favorite recipes that use tempeh.
  
  For an incredibly messy (and non-vegan) option, try adding a runny
  fried egg to the sandwich stack. [BTW, it's messy even without the
  egg - cut sandwich in half for easier eating]. Tempeh only keeps in
  the fridge a couple of days. But it keeps in the free
  
  Difficulty    : easy. Precision
  : approximate measurements.

           Vegetarian Times, 12/90
    1/2 lb Snow peas
      1 lg Onion
      8    Shitake mushrooms
      1 lg Garlic clove
      3 tb Canola oil (divided)
    1/2 c  Homemade Teriyaki Sauce
           ;see recipe
    1/2 lb Tempeh
           Fresh ground pepper
      1 tb Toasted sesame oil
      3 c  Cooked brown basmati rice
           For garnish:
           Green onions
           Almond slices
 
  Preparation: If using dried shitakes, soak in water to refresh. Cut
  tempeh into thin slices.  Cut onion in thin slivers. Mince garlic.
  Remove strings from snow peas, if necessary. Remove stems from
  shitkes, and slice mushrooms thinly.
  
  Heat 2 TB canola oil in saucepan or wok, gradually raising heat to
  medium. Fry tempeh slices in batches, until one side becomes golden;
  turn and fry other side until golden. Remove and drain on paper towel.
  
  Add 1 TB canola oil and sesame oil to pan; raise heat to medium-hot.
  Add snow peas,mushrooms, onions, and garlic; saute ONLY until onions
  are translucent, not brown, and snow peas are bright green. Then add
  drained tempeh.  While stirring and tossing, add the teriyaki sauce;
  be careful to turn the heat down, as the sauce will sizzle
  'dramatically' according to the author. Season with pepper.
  
  Serve over brown rice, garnishing with slivered green onions and
  almonds if desired.
  
  Serves 4.

       Make several crosswise slits on the underside of shrimp to
  prevent curling.  Parboil green beans.  Pat shrimp and vegetables
  dry; arrange on platter; cover and refridgerate until serving time.
  Prepare batter and sauce recipes.  Do not make batter recipe too far
  ahead of time.
       Heat oil in a wok to 360 degrees.  Dep shrimp and vegetables into
  batter with tongs; allow excess batter to drip into bowl. Fry a few
  pieces at a time until golden brown, turning once (cooking time
  approximately 2-3 minutes).     This is best prepared close to or at
  the table. It is great fun to have a "tempura party" with guests
  cooking their own. Serve with sauce and rice. (you may need more
  batter mix depending on the amounts of seafood and vegetables you
  prepare).  Does not keep well once cooked.

      Title: TEMPURA AHI ROLL
 Categories: Main dish, Fish
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Fresh Ahi Tuna or other
           Sushi style fish
      2 ea Nori Paper
      1 ea Cucumber sliced lengthwise
      1 ea Carrot sliced lengthwise
           Toasted sesame seeds
           Oil for deep frying
      1 c  Flour
      1 c  Club Soda
      1 ea Egg yolk
 
  Slice ahi to 1/4 inch thick rectangle 4 to 6 inches on either side.
  Roll two slices each of the carrot and cucumber inside the tuna. Roll
  the tuna inside a sheet of the seaweed paper and seal sheet with a
  dab of water. Prepare the deep fryer by heating the oil to 350 to
      370    F.
  
  Prepare the tempura batter by mixing the flour, egg yolk and club
  soda. The amount of flour and soda should be modified to give the
  tempura the right consistency.  The batter should be thick enough to
  coat, but runny enough to spread easily.
  
  When oil is ready, coat the roll in batter and deep fry for no more
  than three minutes when the batter becomes a light golden color. Left
  over carrots and cucumber or other vegitables (mushrooms come out
  great) can be tempura fried as well.  Remove from oil and drain on a
  paper towel.
  
  Trim off ends to make a flat surface for presentation.  Slice in half
  diagonally, then slice each half into two pieces, one flat on both
  sides and one with one diagonal and one flat side.  The ahi should be
  only slightly cooked on the outter edge, but should remain mostly raw
  throughout.  Stand roll on edge on plate and sprinkle with sesame
  seeds. Can be served with ponzu, soy or soy-wasabi sauce.

      Title: TEMPURA ONION RINGS
 Categories: Japanese, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Vegetable oil, for frying
  1 1/2 c  Cornstarch
      3    Red onions, peeled, sliced
           -crosswise to 1/3-inch
           Thick (about 1-1/4 lbs.)
  1 1/2 c  Flour, all-purpose
      1 ts Salt, plus more for sprinkl
           -ing
  1 1/2 c  Ice, coarsely crushed
           Lemon wedges, ketchup and
           - soy sauce, for serving
 
  1.  In a deep fryer or large saucepan, heat the oil the 350F.
  Meanwhile, put 1 cup of the cornstarch in a brown paper bag. Add the
  onion slices and shake well to coat. Transfer the coated onion rings
  to a large baking sheet.
  
  2.  In a large bowl, mix the remaining 1/2 cup cornstarch with the
  flour and 1 teaspoon salt.  Add 1-1/2 cups of cold water all at once
  into the flour mixture. Stir vigorously with chopsticks or a fork to
  be pieces of ice and lumps the size of a nickel in the batter.
  
  3. When the oil is hot, add as many coated onion rings to the batter
  as will fit comfortably in the fryer; you will have to do this in
  about 5 batches: Using chopsticks or a large fork, life the rings to
  the hot oil and separate any that cling together. Fry the onion rings
  until golden brown all over, about 3 minutes. Transfer to paper
  towels or a paper bag to drain well. Repeat with the remaining onion
  rings and batter. Sprinkle the onion rings with salt if desired.
  Serve hot, warm or at room temperature with lemon, ketchup or soy
  sauce. Serves 4 to 6. Food & Wine, June, 1991.

      Title: TEMPURA THE JAPANESE WAY
 Categories: Ethnic, Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Koromo ( batter )
      1    Egg beaten
      1 c  "cold" water
      2 tb Dry white wine
      1 c  Flour
           Tentsuyu(dipping sauce)
      1 tb Dashi no moto( fish stock)
      1 c  Water
      2 tb Mirin( sweet rice wine )
           Or 1 tbs sugar
      2 tb Sake ( or dry white wine )
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
           Ginger root to taste
           Vegetables & fish: EX:
           Carrots, onions, mushrooms
           Peppers, zucchini, snow pea,
           Squash, eggplant etc. etc.
           "okra "
           Shrimps, crab, scallops,
           Squid, cod. etc. etc.
 
  Before you begin here a few essential tips to remember: youUll need a
  deep thick wall pan ( wok o.k. ), filled with 1 inch of peanut oil
  preferred ( Never lard or shortening ),slice vegetables thin enough
  for even cooking, fry in small batches and never crowd, and have the
  temperature of the oil from 340 for vegetables or 360 degrees for
  fish. Cold water in batter is a must to keep the flour from being
  sticky .Do a trial try of frying so youUll know how long vegetables
  or fish need to cook. Author did not mention  poultry but I surmise
  it would be cooked as the fish is. Vegetables and fish were the
  initial things cooked this way in the history of tempura due to their
  trade with the Portuguese and Dutch merchants. Make the batter: Beat
  egg with water. Mix in flour and whisk quickly. Set aside. Make the
  tempura dip: Boil the dashi no moto ( this is a dried soup stock from
  fish or poultry usually contained in tea bag type of packing )in the
  water for 2 or 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and add all the remaining
  ingredients. Prepare  the vegetables or fish but cutting into rings,
  strips,  cubes etc. For fish, dredge in flour before dipping in
  batter. Vegetables are just dipped into the batter. Let excess batter
  drip off with either fish or vegetables.( meanwhile you will have had
  the oil preheated in the pan to the right temperature for either fish
  or vegetables Drop into oil by hand or use  a tbs for vegetable
  cubes. Take the vegetables or fish out of the oil when slightly
  browned. Serve the tempura with the Tentsuyu dip along with
  rice.Place  rice in a bowl, top with tempura and a few tbs. of the
  tentsuyu dip. Or serve tempura over Japanese noodles ( soba ).
  
  Note all Japanese ingredients may be found  readily in most
  supermarkets or gourmet grocers today.  Also, there are other
  variations in frying tempura; this is one basic historic method.
  Prior to using peanut oil, sesame seed oil was used mainly when
  tempura first became popular in Japan, over 400 years ago.

MMMMM---------------------FOR THE VEGETABLES--------------------------
      1    Eggplant (about 1/2 lb)
     16    Fresh snow peas; stemmed
    1/2 lb Fresh small mushrooms, like
           -shitake or oysters, cut in
           -half
      1 sm Sweet potato, peeled and cut
           -into 1/4" slices
      1    Bell pepper, green or red,
           -stemmed, seeded and cut
           -into 8 slices
           Peanut oil for frying
      1    Egg yolk
      2 c  Ice-cold water
    1/8 ts Baking soda
  1 2/3 c  All-purpose flour
 
  In a small mixing bowl, prepare the dipping sauce: Pour the broth or
  water over the sugar and stir to dissolve, Add soy, wine, ginger and
  oils, and stir well. Add lemon juice or rice vinegar (more or less to
  taste) and divide the sauce among 8 small individual dishes. Preheat
  oven to 200 degrees F. PLace 8 salad plates in the oven to warm.
  Place a rack over a baking sheet, and set aside. Use a vegetable
  peeler to peel stripes of skin form the eggplant, leaving on several
  narrow strips of skin. Halve the eggplant lengthwise and cut it into
  1/4" slices.Wash the slices, pat dry and place on one end of a large
  platter. PLace the rest of the prepared vegetables on the platter. In
  a stockpot or Dutch oven, heat 3" of oil over medium-high heat while
  you prepare the batter. In a large mixing bowl, add the yolk to the
  water and mix well. Stir int he baking soda; then, sift the flour in
  and stir with a wooden spoon. Using chopsticks or wooden tongs, dip
  the vegetables in the batter a piece at a time, moving each piece
  around to coat well. Maintaining oil at 375 degrees, fry the
  vegetables a serving at a time --- 2 pieces of eggplant, 2 snow peas,
  2 mushroom halves, 1 slice sweet potato and 1 slice bell pepper ---
  flipping them after 1 minute. Fry on the second side another minute
  or until lightly golden. Remove pieces with a mesh strainer tot he
  prepared baking sheet to drain. Strain any bits of batter or
  vegetables from the oil, repeat the process withthe second serving.
  When all the serving is placed in the oil, remove the first batch
  from the rack to a warmed plate in the oven. Repeat with remaining
  servings. Place a dish of dipping sauce on each plate of tempura
  vegetables, and serve immediately.
  
  Note: be sure to cut all vegetables into small, even pieces so that
  they cook evenly.  Snow peasa, mushrooms, eggplant, asparagus and
  sweet potatoes are traditional ingredients in Japan, but you can use
  carrots, bell peppers, string beans, cauliflower or onion rings as
  well.

      Title: TEN FOODS YOU SHOULD NEVER EAT
 Categories: Info/tips, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  As an eating machine I'm driven far more by taste than by nutritional
  considerations. After all, one of my all time favorite dishes is Tung
  Po Pork, a Chinese concoction that consists mainly of pork fat and
  skin that is stewed in spices then steamed for several hours. That's
  why I was surprised to find myself interested in a flyer I got from
  The Nutrition Action Healthletter. Maybe it was the title that caught
  my interest. Here are some excerpts from the flyer. 1. Quaker Oats
  100% Natural Cereal. This overrated granola cereal's ten g of fat per
  half cup serving make it high in fat compared to other cereals. And,
  despite the crunch, it's not high in fiber.  A much better choice
  would be a low fat, whole-grain cereal like Kellogg Nutri-Grain
  Wheat, Post Grape-Nuts, General Mills Wheaties, or Nabisco Shredded
  Wheat. 2. Contadina Alfredo Sauce. A typical four ounce serving
  contains 34 grams of fat++20 of them artery-clogging saturated fat.
  That's like drowning your pasta in more than a third of a stick of
  butter If you want a good bottled pasta sauce, try Enrico's Spaghetti
  Sauce No Salt Added, Tree of Life, or Colavita. 3. Nissin Chicken Cup
  O' Noodles. It will give you a surprisingly strong shot of fat (about
  3 teaspoons' worth) and almost as much sodium (1,700 mg) as you
  should ideally eat in a whole day.  Try The Spice Hunter Quick and
  Natural Soups instead. A serving averages just half a teaspoon of fat
  and 200 mg of sodium++a much healthier alternative. 4. Taco Bell's
  Taco Salad with Shell. With the shell, this platter of beef, cheese,
  and beans has 14 teaspoons of fat, more than 5 teaspoons of saturated
  fat, and 905 calories. That's almost all the fat and saturated fat an
  adult should eat in an entire day. If you're in the mood for a fast
  food salad, head to McDonald's. Its Chunky Chicken Salad contains a
  single teaspoon of fat and 1/4 teaspoon of saturated fat. 5. Swanson
  Great Starts Scrambled Eggs & Sausage with Hash Browns. This measly 6
  1/2-ounce breakfast will slap you with more than half the fat you
  should eat in a day.  And Swanson won't even say how much saturated
  fat and cholesterol it contains. You'd be better off skipping
  breakfast entirely. For a healthier microwave morning, have a Healthy
  Choice English Muffin Breakfast.  At just one teaspoon of fat per
  serving and 15 to 20 mg of cholesterol (it contains egg whites, not
  yolks), it's a far "healthier" choice. 6. Oscar Mayer Lunchables. It
  would be hard to invent a worse food than these combos of heavily
  processed meat, artery-clogging cheese, and mostly white-flour
  crackers. The line averages 5 1/2 teaspoons of fat (that's 55 percent
  of calories) and 1,517 mg of sodium. You'd get less fat and salt from
  two slices of Pizza Hut's Pepperoni Pan Pizza. 7. Haagen-Dazs Ice
  Cream.  Gourmet ice creams like Haagen-Dazs and Ben & Jerry's are
  loaded with grease. A one-cup serving has as much artery-clogging
  saturated fat as 1/4 cup of lard.  Choose an ice milk like Breyers
  Light and you'll cut the fat by 75 percent. Buy Sealtest Free or
  Edy's or Dreyer's Fat Free and you'll get rid of almost all the fat.
  8. Campbell Chunky Soups. They're brimming with salt. An average
  9-ounce serving contains 975 mg of sodium. That's half your quota for
  an entire day. If you're looking for more than salty water, check out
  Pritikin Soups. A cup has 160 mg of sodium and less than one gram of
  fat. That's a bit less fat-and far less sodium than you'll find in
  Campbell's Healthy Request or ConAgra's Healthy Choice Soups. 9.
  Swanson Hungry Man Turkey Pot Pie. If you think that turkey products
  are always lower in fat than foods made with beef or pork, you're
  wrong. Crammed into a single pie are 650 calories, 36 grams of fat,
  and 1,470 mg of sodium. That makes it worse than Swanson's Hungry Man
  Beef Pot Pie. 10. Stouffer's Entrees. Despite their popularity,
  Stouffer's en- trees get a greater percent of their calories from tat
  (440 percent than any other major line of frozen dinners or entrees.
  Not one of Stouffer's 52 varieties meets our criteria for a "healthy"
  frozen meal. If you want low-sodium, low-fat frozen meals, try Tyson
  Healthy Portions, Healthy Choice Dinners, or Le Menu New American
  Healthy. From the Nutrition Action Healthletter, 1875 Connecticut
  Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20009. The only vegetables we found in an
  entire Banquet Vegetable Pie with Chicken were twelve peas, 1/11 of a
  carrot, and 1/12 of a potato. And in a Lean Cuisine Glazed Chicken
  with Vegetable Rice, you'll find just 1/3 of a mushroom, 1/2 ounce of
  green beans, and a teaspoon of onions. That's it for vegetables! Need
  more whole grains in your diet? Don't count on Wheatsworth Stone
  Ground Wheat Crackers, with less than half a tablespoon of whole-
  wheat flour in four crackers. And Prego's "made with Fresh Mushrooms"
  Spaghetti Sauce has only about half a mushroom per serving ... that's
  three mushrooms in the whole jar! This newsletter appears to be a
  culinary Consumer's Guide with products reviewed by brand name along
  with "healthy" recipes (they cite Indian, Mexican and Asian recipes)

      Title: TEN STEPS TO A PICTURE-PERFECT TURKEY
 Categories: Butterball, Turkey, Info
      Yield: 1 Info
 
 
  Every year, the Butterball Test Kitchen staff roasts numerous turkeys
  to determine the method that will produce the best-tasting,
  picture-perfect turkey. Time and again, the "Butterball Open Pan
  Roasting Method" wins hands down. This method virtually guarantees a
  moist, flavorful, golden turkey. Follow these 10 easy steps to create
  a picture-perfect turkey:
  
  l. If turkey is frozen, thaw in the refrigerator or cold water. When
  ready to cook, remove the wrapper. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
  
  2. Remove the neck from the body cavity and the giblets from the neck
  cavity. Drain the juices and blot the cavities with paper towels.
  
  3. Just before roasting, stuff the neck and body cavities lightly, if
  desired. Turn the wings back to hold the neck skin in place. Return
  legs to tucked position, if untucked. No trussing is necessary.
  
  4. Place the turkey, breast side up, on a flat rack in an open
  roasting pan about 2 inches deep. A handy "Turkey Lifter" comes with
  each Butterball Turkey. Place this special string cradle on a rack,
  then place the turkey on top and bring the loops up around the
  turkey. Do this before putting the turkey in the oven and when
  lifting the cooked turkey from the pan, use the loops as handles.
  
  5. Insert an oven-safe meat thermometer deep into the lower part of
  the thigh next to the body, not touching the bone.
  
  6. Brush the skin with vegetable oil to prevent skin from drying.
  Further basting is unnecessary.
  
  7. Wash preparation utensils, work surfaces and hands in hot, soapy
  water following contact with uncooked turkey and juices.
  
  8. Roast at 325 degrees F. For approximate cooking times, see
  roasting time schedule. When the skin is light golden, about 2/3
  done, shield the breast loosely with lightweight foil to prevent
  overcooking.
  
  9. Check for doneness 1/2 hour before turkey is expected to be done.
  Turkey is fully cooked when the thigh's internal temperature is 180
  degrees F. The thickest part of breast should read 170 degrees F and
  the center of the stuffing should be 160 degrees F.
  
  10. When done, let the turkey stand for 15 to 20 minutes before
  carving.
  
        BUTTERBALL OPEN PAN ROASTING TIME SCHEDULES
  
  Following are newly revised cooking times for turkey roasted at 325
  degrees F on a flat rack in a shallow open pan, about 2 inches. An
  extensive Butterball study has revealed that today's turkeys are
  cooking quicker, making them more convenient for consumers. This
  schedule should be used as a guideline. Start checking for doneness
  1/2 hour before recommended end times.
  
  Net Weight      Unstuffed       Stuffed (in pounds) (in hours) (in
  hours) 10 to 18        3 to 3-1/2
      3-3/4 to 4-1/2 18 to 22 3-1/2 to 4 4-1/2 to 5 22 to 24 4 to 4-1/2

      1 c  White Chinese turnip,
           -shredded
      1 c  White Chinese celery,

      8    Pieces soy spiced beancurd
           -(or Loma Linda brand
           -Vegetable Hamburger)
      3 c  Soybean sprouts (NOT mung
           -bean sprouts)
      4    Green onions, shredded
    1/2 c  Nami dried black mushrooms,
           -soaked & shredded
    1/2 c  Cloud Ear dried fungus,
           -soaked
    1/2 c  Dried lily flowers, soaked
           -and hard tips removed
      2 oz Bean thread noodles, soaked
      1 ts Salt (to taste)
 
  About 6 to 8 T peanut oil for stir-frying PREPARATION: Shred in 2"
  lengths: carrots, turnip, Chinese celery and beancurd. Shred onions,
  greens & all, into 2" lengths. Rinse, then soak in hot water: enough
  mushrooms, fungus and lily flowers to give specified amounts. Shred
  mushrooms, chop fungus. Soak bean thread noodles.  Bean thread
  noodles are important because they soak up excess moisture from the
  vegetables. Vegetables should be moist but not soggy or watery after
  stir-frying. STIR-FRYING: Stir-fry fresh vegetables separately with
  about 1 tablespoon oil for each, in hot wok. Add salt to taste.
  Drain off excess water, reserve. (Soybean sprouts should be cooked
  until they are slightly charred for fullest flavor.) To stir-fry
  dried soaked ingredients, begin with hot wok, add 2 to 3 tablespoons
  oil, then add mushroom, fungus & lily flowers. Stir-fry green onions,
  add all other ingredients to them, including noodles. Allow dish to
  cool before serving. NOTE:  Fresh or canned bamboo shoot may be
  substituted for any vegetable. Seaweed may be used instead of some of
  the fungus.

      Title: TENDER BROCCOLI STEMS WITH CLAMS
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Broccoli
      4 lg Cloves garlic
      1 tb Fermented soy beans
    1/4 c  Canned baby clams (or
           -crabmeat or shrimp)
    1/2 c  Stock
      2 tb Peanut oil for first
           -stir-frying
      1 tb Peanut oil
           Cornstarch paste
 
  Preparation:  Wash broccoli and cut off flowerets (save for another
  dish). With small paring knife, carefully peel outer skin off
  broccoli stems, beginning at the base.  Leave inner stems whole.  Cut
  stems on the bias into 1/4" slices.
  
  Rinse fermented soy beans.  Peel garlic.  Mince together soy beans and
  garlic; then mash to a paste using mortar and pestle; set aside. Place
  drained baby clams in stock. If substituting fresh clams, crabmeat or
  shrimp, wash, shell and chop into small pieces.
  
  Stir-frying:  Heat wok to hot, then add first of oil. When oil just
  begin to smoke, add broccoli and toss quickly to avoid burning.
  Stir-fry for about 1 minute. Turn heat down to moderate (or on
  electric range, remove from heat).  Push broccoli up side of wok; add
  remaining oil to bottom of wok; add soy bean mixture. Press and stir
  until odor of beans and garlic is present.
  
  Return to high heat and immediately recombine with broccoli, stirring
  constantly for about 30 seconds. Beans and garlic will burn easily,
  so keep mixture moving. Quickly add clams and stock; stir-fry for
  another 30 seconds.  Cover for 30 seconds to finish cooking broccoli.
  Remove cover; thicken with cornstarch paste to light sauce.

      Title: TENDER COOKER CHUCK ROAST
 Categories: Beef
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 tb Oil
      3 lb Chuck roast
    1/2 c  Water
      1    Garlic clove, chopped
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
      1    Onion, cut up
      3    Potatoes, cut up
      1 tb Flour
 
  Heat oil in medium sized skillet, sear meat on all sides; place meat
  in Tender Cooker.  Add water, garlic, salt and pepper to skillet.
  Heat and scrape off any browned meat; pour mixture over meat. Arrange
  onion and potato on top of meat.  Place a single 7" circle of foil on
  top of food. Cover and add regulator guage, microwave on high 30
  minutes. Let pressure indicator drop, remove cover. Remove meat and
  vegies, add flour mixed with a little water, stir, microwave,
  uncovered, stir once, to thicken juices. (a 400-500 w oven needs an
  increase of time of 6 min.)
  
  That is their recipe - I don't do any of the above. My roast is
  usually one with a lot less fat in in (as little as I can manage when
  I cut a big piece of meat into roast, steak and stew meat) and is
  almost always still frozen and so I don't brown it first.  I put the
  meat and water in the cooker, cover and cook on high 20 minutes. When
  the indicator drops, I add potatoes, onion, carrots, and such
  seasoning as I want at the time, rinse the rubber ring, replace ring,
  recover (with pressure cap) and micro on high for 10 minutes. Let
  pressure drop, thicken juices and enjoy!

      Title: TENO SALMON
 Categories: Fish, Lapp
      Yield: 1 Serving
 
    3/4 lb Salmon, per person
           Water, butter, salt
 
  Cross cut 1-inch slices from the salmon.  I prefer slices about the
  size of my palm but also smaller ones will do. Use toothpicks to bind
  them into round cutlets.
  
  Pour about 1/4 inch water into a frying pan and bring it to a boil.
  Add cutlets and simmer until the water has evaporated. Turn cutlets
  once during cooking.
  
  Add butter, fry lightly on both sides.  Add salt to taste and remove
  toothpicks.
  
  Serve with boiled or mashed potatoes and sliced lemon. (Lemon is not
  traditional, but...)
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Traditional salmon dish from Lappland -- This is the traditional
  way to prepare salmon on the river Teno (the northern border river
  between Norway and Finland).
  
  : Difficulty:  very easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes to prepare, 20 minutes to cook.
  : Precision:  don't let water cover the cutlets.

    1/2 c  Soy sauce
    1/4 c  Sherry, dry
      1 ts Ginger, fresh; grated
           -(substitute 2 tsp ground
           -ginger, if you must)
      2 md Garlic cloves, crushed
 
  Place chicken in plastic bag. Combine remaining ingredients in small
  bowl ad pour over chicken in bag, turning to coat. Close bag and
  marinate in refrigerator for at least 6 hours, turning 2 or 3 times.
  Remove chicken from marinade; reserve marinade. Arrange on rack over
  foil-lined broiler pan. Cover chicken with foil. Bake at 350 degrees
  for 30 minutes. Uncover; brush with marinade. Bake, uncovered, 30-45
  minutes or until done, brushing occasionally with marinade. Four

  [Note: When I try this, I think I'll do this on the gas grill and will
  probably make double the amount of sauce so that, when I refrigerate
  the leftovers for other meals, there will still be plenty of sauce
  and it won't be dry.]

      1 lb Boned, skinned turkey breast
           Or turkey tenderloins
           -trimmed of all fat and
           -connective tissue
    1/4 ts Onion powder
    1/4 ts Garlic powder
    1/2 c  -water
    1/4 c  Reduced-sodium soy sauce
      2 ts Worcestershire
      2 tb Firmly packed brown sugar
      1 ts Pepper
    1/2 ts Liquid smoke
           Vegetable cooking spray
 
  Freeze turkey until firm but not hard; then cut into 1/8- to
  1/4-inch-thick slices.
  
  In a medium-size glass, stoneware, plastic or stainless steel bowl,
  combine onion powder, garlic powder, water soy sauce, Worcestershire,
  sugar, pepper, and liquid smoke.  Stir to dissolve seasonings. Add
  turkey and mix until all surfaces are thoroughly coated. Cover
  tightly and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or until next day,
  stirring occasionally; recover tightly after stirring.
  
  Drying the jerky:  Depending on the drying method you're using,
  evenly coat dehydrator racks or metal racks with cooking spray; if
  oven drying, place racks over rimmed baking pans.
  
  Lift turkey from bowl, shaking off any excess liquid. Arrange strips
  close together, but not overlapping, on racks.
  
  Dehydrator drying:  Arrange trays according to manufacture's
  directions and dry at 140-degrees until a piece of jerky cracks and
  breaks when bent (4-1/2 to 6 hours; let jerky cool for 5 minutes
  before testing).
  
  Oven drying:  Set oven to 140 to 200 degrees (the lower, the
  better--the lowest your oven allows). Place racks at least 4 inches
  away from (above or below) heat source.  Prop oven door open by about
  2 inches. Dry until a piece of jerky cracks and breaks when bent (4
  to 6 hours; let jerky cool for 5 minutes before testing).
  
  Pat off any beads of oil from jerky.  Let jerky cool completely on
  racks; remove from racks, place ina rigid freezer container, and
  freeze for 72 hours. Then store in airtight, insectproof containers
  in a cool, dry place; or freeze or refrigerate.

      Title: TERNERA EN ADOBO (VEAL IN CHILI & VINEGAR SAU
 Categories: Mexican, Veal, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  This Mexican dish is an excellent way to use difficult cuts like the
  breast of veal and any ragged chops.
  
  Put the veal complete with bones into a saucepan and add the knuckle
  of veal or any other veal bones you may have saved. Add 1 onion, a
  clove of garlic, several sprigs of fresh coriander and water to just
  cover.
  
  Simmer gently, covered, for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours until tender.
  
  Since this part of the operation requires almost no effort, it is a
  good idea to do it while cooking dinner the night before and
  refrigerate the meat in the stock overnight so that the fat can be
  easily removed (the breast is the fattiest cut) before proceeding the
  next night.
  
  Remove the cooked meat from the stock and bone it, discarding the
  bones. Strain the stock and set aside. Wash out the saucepan.
  
  Into a food processor with processing blade, put 3 birds-eye chillies,
  seeded and roughly chopped, 1 onion, quartered, several cloves of
  garlic, 1 teaspoon of dried oregano, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 2
  tablespoons of red wine vinegar and a little salt. Process to a paste.
  
  Put a little olive oil into the saucepan, heat it and fry the
  processed paste gently, stirring, for a few minutes.
  
  Add about 300 ml of the stock or enough to obtain a sauce
  consistency: Add the cooked meat to the sauce and simmer gently for
  about 15 minutes longer. Correct the seasoning it necessary: and
  serve with rice or rice and beans.
  
  Serves 3 to 4.

      Title: TERRIYAKI CHICKEN WINGS
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Soy sauce
    1/4 c  Honey
      1    Cl Garlic; minced
    1/2 ts Ginger
 
  Recipe by: "Lynne M. Underhill" <underhil@IBL.BM> Mix all ingredients
  together.  Put some of the sauce aside for use when cooking. Put the
  remaining sauce and about 1 1/2 pounds chicken wings in a resealable
  bowl. Marinate in the refrigerator overnight  Then pop them on
  preheated barbecue or under the broiler basting with reserved sauce.
  Turn often. They tend to get quite burnt on the outside (I like them
  that way though) but you may want to pre-cook the wings in the
  microwave for a few minutes before putting them on the grill. Make
  sure you cook them thoroughly!!! Don't want to make anyone sick!

      Title: TESTING JAR SEALS
 Categories: Canning, Information
      Yield: 1 Guide
 
 
  After cooling jars for 12 to 24 hours, remove the screw bands and test
  seals with one of the following options:
  
  Option 1. Press the middle of the lid with a finger or thumb. If the
  lid springs up when you release your finger the lid is unsealed.
  
  Option 2. Tap the lid with the bottom of a teaspoon. If it makes a
  dull sound, the lid is not sealed. If food is in contact with the
  underside of the lid, it will also cause a dull sound. If the jar is
  sealed correctly, it will make a ringing, high-pitched sound.
  
  Option 3. Hold the jar at eye level and look across the lid. The lid
  should be concave (curved down slightly in the center). If center of
  the lid is either flat or bulging, it may not be sealed.

           Cayenne
 
  "Saute" the onion in a little water, until it has browned slightly (I
  tend to brown it, then add the water to un-stick it from the bottom
  of the pan). Add in the peppers, one type at a time; heat through.
  Drain the beans, reserving a little of the liquid (not a lot -- it's
  pretty salty), rinse the beans and add them to the pot. Add in some
  of the bean liquid and some water, until it's  somewhat soupy.  Heat
  thoroughly. Before it's done, add cumin and cayenne to taste (we like
  LOTS of cumin, and a touch of cayenne for a bit of byte).
  
  While this was all cooking, you should also have a pot of rice on to
  cook. Serve the resulting bean concoction over the rice.

  that is what is in those little cans and I used one with no salt. I
  thought it was a bit oily for my taste, so next time I would use less
  oil maybe about a half cup. I used 3 heaping tablespoons of Ortego
  hot chopped Jalopenos...I would use more next time..it was ok but I
  like it hotter. It was fine for those who dont like it really hot.

      Title: TEX-MEX STYLE ENCHILADAS
 Categories: Meats, Tex-mex
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Ground beef,
           -extra-lean (as
           -little fat as possible)
      2 md Onions, chopped
      4 tb Flour
  2 1/2 c  Enchilada sauce
           -(2 standard cans)
      1 lb Cheddar cheese,
           -sharp, grated
 
  PREPARE SAUCE AND FILLING:  Brown ground beef and 1 chopped onion in a
  large skillet. There should be enough fat in the beef to eliminate
  any need for extra oil and also to saute the onions at the same time.
  While you are browning the beef (it should be completely cooked with
  no pink or red color left), be sure to break it up so that it is
  granular in texture, as opposed to chunky, when completely browned.
  Onions should be limp and translucent but not brown.
  
  Add about 4 T  of flour and saute until flour is completely
  incorporated into the meat mixture. Add the enchilada sauce. Heat
  over low heat. If the mixture is too thick, add a little water. The
  consistency should be that of a thick gravy, but not soupy. Simmer
  over low heat for 20-30 minutes.
  
  PREPARE ROLLED ENCHILADAS:  Rolled enchiladas are tougher to
  assemble, but more authentic.  Have ready a large baking pan, we
  always use an oblong Pyrex pan. One at a time, dip each tortilla in
  the enchilada sauce just enough to coat and slightly soften. Lay the
  tortilla flat in the baking pan, spoon about 3 T of the enchilada
  sauce in a line down the middle, top with about 1 t chopped onion and
  about 3 T of grated cheese.
  
  Roll the tortilla tightly into a cylinder with the seam on the
  bottom, and position against the bottom edge of the baking pan.
  Repeat until the pan is full. This can get tricky (but it is
  possible) as the pan gets full. Assembling the enchilada outside of
  the pan is usually a messy disaster. Depending on the size of the pan
  and how tightly each enchilada is rolled, you can get 8-12 enchiladas
  in a pan. This recipe should make about 16-24 enchiladas.
  
  Spoon enchilada sauce over the assembled enchiladas to thinly cover.
  Sprinkle generously with grated cheese. Bake at 425 degrees F. for 20
  minutes.
  
  PREPARE STACKED ENCHILADAS:  This is the New Mexico style. It is much
  easier to assemble. Have plates ready. One at a time, submerge each
  tortilla in the enchilada sauce (which should be cooking on low heat
  during this process) and cook until limp but not falling apart, this
  may take a little practice to gauge the time.
  
  Remove the tortilla from the sauce and place flat on a plate. Spoon a
  little sauce, including meat, over the tortilla, add about 1 T chopped
  onion and about 4 T grated cheese. Repeat the process until you have a
  stack of 3-4 tortillas on a plate, depending on the appetite of the
  person who will eat them. Top the last tortilla with a generous
  amount of sauce and cheese. Serve immediately.
  
  The fundamental difference between these two styles is the method
  used to cook the tortillas. In the rolled style, the sauce is cooked
  into the tortilla through the baking process. In the stacked style,
  the tortilla is cooked directly in the sauce. Only the appearance
  differs, the taste is the same with either style.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Central Texas style Mexican enchiladas -- We cook beef enchiladas
  in two ways, the traditional rolled enchilada and the easier-to-cook
  New Mexico stacked style. Both procedures are given. Also, we used to
  cook the enchilada sauce/chili from scratch but more recently began
  using a shortcut with canned Old El Paso brand enchilada sauce, since
  it is not only faster (20 minutes vs. 4+ hours) but also has a very
  authentic spice combination. Yield: Serves 6-8.
  
  *  I always use Old El Paso canned enchilada sauce, though it is
  possible to make your own.

  left), be sure to break it up so that it is granular in texture, as
  opposed to chunky, when completely browned. Onions should be limp and
  translucent but not brown.
  
  Drain off as much fat as possible.  Add salt and chile powder and
  continue to saute until the chile is completely incorporated into the
  meat mixture. Cover skillet and leave on extremely low heat, just
  enough to keep the meat hot.
  
  Put about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil in a small skillet, and heat it.
  Test the oil for proper temperature by putting in a small piece of
  tortilla. When the oil reaches the temperature where it immediately
  begins to bubble frantically over the tortilla as soon as it is put
  in the oil and the tortilla piece becomes crisp quite quickly, you
  are ready to cook the taco shells.  This is important because there
  is nothing worse than a soggy taco shell (which results from the oil
  not being hot enough).
  
  Using tongs, put the tortillas in the oil, one at a time, and cook for
  30-60 seconds until the underside just starts to become crisp. With
  the tongs, turn the tortilla over and, using a spatula, bend in half
  to form the shell. Cook each side of the bent tortilla until crisp,
  about 30-45 seconds per side. Remove the shell from the oil and drain
  on a newspaper-covered cookie sheet. The cooked shells can be kept
  warm in the oven at very low heat.
  
  To assemble, fill each shell about 2/3s full of the meat and top with
  cheese, tomato and lettuce. We like to add extra zap with a shot of
  Tabasco sauce.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  San Antonio, Texas style tacos -- My dad is from east Texas and my
  mom from southern Oklahoma, but they developed their definition of
  Tex-Mex from several years in San Antonio. Since they now live in
  D.C., they feel extremely deprived, none of the chain restaurants
  come anywhere near the taste they developed in San Antonio.
  
  Tex-Mex cooking is based on peasant-style dishes from the areas of
  Mexico bordering Texas.  The primary ingredients of Tex-Mex cooking
  are corn tortillas (the thinner the better), ground beef, pinto beans
  and hot chile powder, sharp Cheddar cheese and onions.  Yield:
        1    dozen tacos.
  
  *  Don't try to use instant onion in this recipe.  In San Antonio,
  people consider that the best chile powder is Gebhardt's or Eagle
  Brand.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes.
  : Precision:  measure the spices.

      Title: TEXAS BARBECUED BEEF BRISKET
 Categories: Bar-b-q, Thrill of t, Meats
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
     10 lb Beef brisket
      2 c  All-south barbecue rub; see
      2 c  Basic all-american bbq sauce
 
  Recipe by: The Thrill of the Grill by Chris Schlesinger 1. Rub the
  brisket thoroughly on all its sides with the barbecue rub, and allow
  it to come to room temperature.
  
  2. In the pit of a covered grill, build a very small fire on one side
  as far up against one wall as possible. Place the brisket on the
  grill on the side opposite from the fire so that none of the brisket
  is directly over the flame. Put the top on the cooker, pull up a
  chair, and grab the cooler.
  
  This is where a person learns about the Zen of Barbecue. You gotta
  keep the fire going, but very quietly. If you've got a thermometer on
  your covered grill, you want to keep the temperature between 180 and
  220 F. Remer, "Slow and low is the way to go." You have to figure out
  your own personal refueling policy. The one I like is one handful of
  coals or wood chunks to every beer.
  
  This goes on for about 8 to 10 hours or however long you can make it,
  the longer the better. Don't be scared by the darkening of the
  exterior, the outside of the brisket will be superdark--my personal
  favorite part.
  
  3. Upon completion, pull the brisket out, trim off any excess fat, and
  slice it thin. Serve with barbecue sauce on the side--no pro would
  ever cover properly cooked brisket with sauce, he'd just dab on a
  touch.
  
  Obviously the key here is a tremendous amount of patience and a day
  when you want to do nothing but sit around. But the end product is
  one of those great culinary events that results from spending a lot
  of time doing something that is relaxing and enjoyable. Make sure you
  have plenty of tall boys for eating this.

      Title: TEXAS BARBEQUED BEEF BRISKET
 Categories: Barbeque, Beef
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea Boneless beef brisket (6 to
           - 8 pounds)
      2 ts Paprika
      1 ts Ground black pepper, divided
      1 tb Butter
      1 ea Medium onion, grated
  1 1/2 c  Catsup
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
      1 tb Worcestershire sauce
      1 ts Hot pepper sauce
 
  Trim external fat on beef brisket to 1/4 inch. Combine paprika and
  1/2 tsp of the black pepper; rub evenly over surface of beef brisket.
  Place brisket, fat side down, in 11 1/2 X 9" disposable foil pan. Add
  1 cup water.  Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil. Place in center
  of grid over very low coals (use a single layer of coals with space
  in between each); cover cooker.  Cook 5 - 6 hours, turning brisket
  over every 1 1/2 hours; use baster to remove fat from pan as it
  accumulates. Add 1/2 cup water, if needed, to pan during cooking.
  (Add just enough briquette during cooking to keep coals at a very low
  temperature). Remove brisket from pan; place on grid, fat side down,
  directly over very low coals. Reserve pan dripping. Cover; continue
  cooking for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
  
  Meanwhile, skim fat from pan drippings; reserve 1 cup drippings. Melt
  butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion; cook until
  tender crisp.  Add reserved pan drippings, remaining 1/2 teaspoon
  black pepper, the catsup, lemon juice, worcestershire sauce and hot
  pepper sauce; simmer
       15    minutes.
  
  Carve brisket into thin slices across the grain; serve with sauce.
  Garnish with fresh peppers and lemon and lime slices.
  
  Note:  For a smokier flavor, soak oak, pecan, mesquite or hickory
  chips in water 30 minutes and add to very low coals.

    1/2 ts Freshly Ground Black Pepper
 
  When the fire has burned down to hot coals, spread to provide
  moderate heat and fit a drip pan in front of in the center of the
  coals. Place the brisket, fat side up, over the drip pan. Cover the
  grill and adjust the dampers to maintain slow steady heat. While the
  meat is cooking, in a sauce pan combine all of the other ingredients,
  blending well, and simmer for 10 minutes.  After 1 hour, baste the
  meat lightly with the sauce and turn the meat as needed to cook
  evenly. Replenish the fire as needed, but don't pile the coals, as
  the brisket should cook slowly. Cook 4 to 5 hours total until the
  meat almost falls apart. Sprinkle 2 to 3 handfuls of hickory chips,
  that have been soaked in water, over the coals. Cover the grill or
  enclose the top of the meat in a sheet of foil, tucked around the
  bottom edges of the meat and let the hickory smoke the meat for 10 to
  15 minutes. Remove the cover and brush the meat with the sauce. Place
  the meat on a platter and slice.  It will crumble. Serve the meat and
  the remaining sauce on split and buttered sandwich buns. Any leftover
  sandwiches can be frozen and reheated in a Microwave or conventional
  oven, or the shredded meat and sauce can be frozen together to reheat
  later for sandwiches.

 Categories: Main
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6 lb Beef brisket
      2 qt Bone stock
      3    Bay leaves
           Salt and pepper
 
  Put the bay leaves in a about a cup of water and bring to a boil. Let
  it simmer 10 minutes or so, then remove the leaves and add the bay
  tea to the bone stock, along with the salt and pepper. Put the
  brisket in your Dutch Oven and add the stock mixture to cover it
  about a quarter of the way. Cover and cook over the fire, turning the
  brisket about every half hour until it's nearly done.  This can be
  determined by forking. Mop it and lay it on the grill to finish
  cooking, being sure to turn it and mop it every 20 minutes or so. To
  make a good natural gravy, add a little Worcestershire Sauce and
  maybe a dash of chili powder to the liquid you cooked the brisket in.
  You can also serve this with barbecue sauce.

      Title: TEXAS CHEESE ENCHILADAS
 Categories: Chili, Beans, Mexican
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     12    Corn tortillas
      2 x  Hortening (lard best)
      4 tb Cooking oil
      2 x  Lour
      2    Yellow onions, large, choppe
      2 x  Hile powder or ground
      4 c  Grated cheese---either Longh
 
  Allow 3 enchiladas per person. Use a Pyrex utility pan (13-1/2" x
  8-3/4") to cook them. Lightly grease the utility pan (for
  authenticity use lard). Preheat the oven to 400. Chop onions and
  grate cheese. Saute the onions lightly in 2 T. oil. Melt lard in a
  skillet; stir in the flour and make a light roux. Add ground chiles
  or chile powder, water and salt, and cook until thick. Of commercial
  chile powders, Gebhardt's from San Antonio is best, but not as good
  as ground *chiles pasillas*. Heat the remaining oil in a skillet.
  Using kitchen tongs, dip each tortilla in hot oil until well softened
  (about 15 seconds). Hold tortilla up and allow oil to drip back into
  the skillet. Using the tongs, dip tortillas in chili gravy. Place the
  tortilla in the Pyrex pan, put a good-sized pinch of cheese and
  onions in the middle, and roll the tortilla, placing the flap side
  down. Continue filling and rolling tortillas until the pan is full.
  Pour more chili gravy on top of the enchiladas, sprinkle the top
  generously with more grated cheese, and pop into preheated oven. Cook
  only until the cheese begins to bubble (about 10 minutes). Serve
  immediately.

 Categories: Appetizers, Herbs
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
     12 oz Texas goat cheese
    1/2 c  Fresh herbs, loosely packed
           -- (See suggestions below)
      1 sm Garlic clove (or more)
           -- mashed
      2 oz Unsalted butter
      4 oz Fresh ricotta
      3 oz Creme fraiche
      2 tb Flour
      2    Eggs
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      1    9-inch pie crust, prebaked
 
  Suggested herbs to use in this recipe are: basil, parsley, marjoram,
  tarrogon, rosemary, thyme, etc.)
  
  This trendy tart comes from the Mozzarella Company in Dallas,
  purveyors of prize-winning Texas cheeses that often are flavored with
  herbs. It makes a fine brunch fare accompanied by salad, and minature
  tarts are a tremedous hit served as hors d'oeuvres.
  
  DIRECTIONS: =========== Bring all ingredients to room temperature.
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a bowl of food processor, mince
  herbs and garlic. Add cheeses, butter, creme fraiche, eggs, salt, and
  pepper, and process until mixture is smooth. Pour into prebaked pie
  crust. Bake until puffed and golden, about 30 minutes. Serve warm or
  at room temperature. Serves 8 as first course, 6 for luncheon.
  
  AUTHOR'S NOTE: My favorite combination of herbs for this recipe is 1/4
  generous cup parsley, 2 tablespoons fresh rosemary, and 2 tablespoons
  fresh basil.  Often, I also add more garlic, 3 ounces of sun-dried
  tomatoes, and a generous sprinkling of toasted pine nuts.

      3 c  Water
 
  Texas prison chili got its good reputation from Sheriff Smoot Schmid's
  truly fine recipe for the Dallas County Jail. Recently, however, a
  Texas prison chili contest was won by Huntsville Penitentiary with a
  godawful recipe that called for twice as much cumin as chili powder
  and "2 handfuls" of monosodium glutamate. In Texas, this is called
  crime deterrence.
  
  Dallas County Chili
  
  Fry suet in a heavy kettle. Add meat, finely diced garlic and
  seasonings; cover. Cook slowly for four hours, stirring occasionally.
  Add the water and continue cooking until the chili has thickened
  slightly, about one hour. Serve plain or mixed with equal portion of
  cooked pink or red beans.

 Categories: Sauces, Meats, Poultry
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Strong black coffee
      1 c  Tomato catsup
      1 tb Freshly ground black pepper
      1 tb Salt
    1/2 c  Worcestershire sauce
    1/4 c  Butter or margerine
      1 tb Sugar
 
  Combine all ingredients and simmer for at least 30 minutes, stirring
  frequently.  Store in a tightly covered jar in refrigerator. Heat
  before using.  For ribs, I dunk the ribs in the sauce each time I
  turn them. This sauce is very spicy and some people think it's too
  strong for poultry; I disagree.
  
  The coarser the pepper is ground, the better it is. Warning: if this
  is used on country style pork ribs it will make you throw rocks at
  steak!

      Title: TEXAS TOAST
 Categories: Cyberealm, Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------SEE THE FOLLOWING--------------------------
 
  :       Texas toast is simply a thick slice of white bread that has
  been buttered and grilled `til lightly browned (not unlike a grilled
  cheese sandwich).
  :       Some places prefer to use "tub margarine" that has a lower
  water content. Some say only butter, and prefer to butter only one
  side as opposed to buttering both sides. The choice is entirely up to
  you...
  :       Some bread companies sell "Texas Toast" sized sliced bread.
  If you can find it, it is ideal, but the regular sized will do. The
  only difference is the thickness of the slices. (The texas toast
  slices are about as thick as 2 slices of regular white bread.)
  :       It is usually served along with pan gravy (gravy made with pan
  drippings) ala milk or cream gravy, and fried chicken, chicken (or
  country) fried steak, or the like... but it is entirely up to your
  imagination.

      Title: TEXAS-STYLE BRISKET
 Categories: Outdoor, Beef
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Beef brisket (3-5 lbs)
      1 pk Lipton Onion Soup Mix
      1 cn (10.5 oz.) beef broth
      1    Onion, finely chopped
           Crushed red pepper to taste
 
  Start charcoal for indirect method cooking (see note). Trim the fat
  off the brisket. Rub contents of onion soup onto both sides of beef
  and wrap tightly with three sheets of tin foil turning the wrap 90
  degrees after each wrapping. This will help keep the juices from
  seeping out. When coals are white hot throw the brisket on. Cover and
  cook for about 2 hours; turning it over after one hour. Add more
  charcoal as necessary. Remove from grill and carefully open package
  without spilling juices. Return meat to grill for about 10-15 minutes
  (cover with lid).  Meanwhile, mix drippings with the can of broth and
  onion. Bring to a boil to reduce the liquid. When cooking time is up
  for brisket remove juice from heat and pour into a serving bowl. Add
  crushed red pepper to taste.
  
  Note:  Do not place hot coals directly under meat; rather, place some
  in front and some behind.  Use about 16 coals or less at one time.
  Remember to cook slow.

 Categories: Tex-mex, Soups, Crockpot, Meats
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------SHARON MEHL - CFFM46A------------------------
    1/4 md Onion; chopped
           -OR 1 ts. minced onion
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
           -OR 1/4 ts. garlic powder
      2 tb Oil, vegetable
     28 oz Tomatoes, whole; blended

 10 1/2 oz Broth, chicken condensed
           -OR 2 bouillon cubes & water
 10 1/2 oz Soup, tomato, condensed
      1 c  -Water
    1/2 c  Pace picante sauce
      2 ts Sauce, Worcestershire
      1 ts Cumin, ground
      1 ts Chili powder
    1/2 ts Lemon pepper; (optional)
      1 ts Salt; (optional)
      4    Tortillas; corn (optional);
           -cut into 1/2 inch wedges
    1/2 c  Cheese, cheddar (2 oz);
           -shredded (optional)
      2 lb Stew meat, boneless (option)
      2 c  Chicken mixture; (optional)
           -from Chicken Flautas recipe
 
   1. Cook onion, garlic, and stew meat (if using as main course), in
  oil in Dutch oven until onion is tender but not brown; drain well.
  Add tomatoes (with juice) to Dutch oven with remaining ingredients
  except tortillas and cheese.
   2. Bring to a boil; reduce heat.  Simmer uncovered 1 hour.
   3. Add tortillas; continue simmering 10 minutes. Ladle into soup
  bowls; sprinkle with cheese and serve with additional picante sauce.
  
  Makes 6 to 8 servings, about 9 cups soup.
  
  **NOTE: This is so delicious, no one will believe how easy it is to
  make. My "variations" are listed as the "OR" in ingredients...found
  it to taste the same.  I usually don't even mess with the tortillas
  and cheese. It tastes wonderful served with "Chicken Flautas"...or
  just make the chicken as indicated in the Flauta recipe (except chunk
  the chicken) and just toss into this soup! I think this could also
  easily be adapted to crockpot!
  
  Note from Pace: This spicy, tortilla-topped soup owes its authentic
  south-of-the-border flavor to PACE picante sauce and slow, siesta-like
  simmering. Source: Pace Picante 40th Anniversary Cookbook

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------SEPHARDIC COOKING; MARK-----------------------

MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------

MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
 
  ~Jewish, Turkish
        2 c  Sugar
        2 c  Water
        2 ts Lemon juice
        5    Eggs
        1 c  Sugar
      1/4 c  Oil
        1    Orange's juice and rind, ~rind grated
        2 ts Cinnamon, ground
    1 1/4 c  Passover fine matzoh cake ~meal
    1 1/4 c  Blanched almonds, finely ~chopped
  
  1.  First make the syrup.  Mix the sugar and water together in a pan
  and bring to a boil.  Add the lemon juice and simmer over low heat
  from 10 minutes.  Cool the syrup.
  
  2.  To make the cake, beat the eggs until frothy, add the sugar, and
  continue to beat until golden and well mixed.
  
  3.  Add all the other ingredients, one at a time, and stir them into a
  batter.  Pour the batter into a oiled and floured cake pan, 13x9x2"
  and bake in a 350 degrees F oven for 30 minutes. Test the doneness
  with a toothpick.
  
  4.  Remove the cake from the oven and pour the cooled syrup over it.
  Let the cake stand for 2 hours before serving to allow the syrup to be
  absorbed.
  
  Serve at any Passover event, but especially with Turkish coffee.
  Makes 1 cake, about 18 pieces.
  
  This wonderful cake is a Passover favorite for visiting friends and
  foreigners from New York.  Like so many Turkish sweets, the cake is
  bathed in a syrup that keeps it moist but not soggy. The cool syrup
  is poured over the hot cake when it is removed from the oven. Almonds
  are the nut of choice but there are those who prefer the flavor of
  walnuts.

      Title: THACKERAY'S LOBSTER
 Categories: Ireland, Fish, Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Very large lobster
    1/2 lb Butter
      1 tb Mustard
      1 tb Catsup
      1 c  Vinegar (white wine if poss)
           Cayenne pepper to taste
 
  (Amounts are approximate:  the above measurement should be increased
  or decreased depending on the size of the lobster. You want about a
  cup of sauce per two people.) Thackeray's original follows: . "You
  take a lobster, about three feet long if possible, remove the shell,
  cut or break the flesh of the fish in pieces not too small. Someone
  else meanwhile makes a mixture of mustard, vinegar, catsup and lots
  of cayenne pepper. You produce a machine called a "despatcher" which
  has a spirit lamp underneath it that is usually illuminated with
  whiskey." (He appears to be talking about a chafing dish with a
  pretty aggressive flame.) "The lobster, the sauce, and near
  half-a-pound of butter are placed in the despatcher, which is
  immediately closed.  When boiling, the mixture is stirred up, the
  lobster being sure to heave about the pan in a convulsive manner,
  while it emits a remarkable rich and agreeable odour through the
  apartment. A glass and a half of sherry is now thrown into the pan,
  and the contents served out hot, and eaten by the company. Porter
  (i.e. stout) is commonly drunk, and whisly-punch afterwards, and the
  dish is fit for an emperor."
  . Unfortunately the day of inexpensive three-foot-long lobsters has
  passed, even in Ireland (lobsters of this size are still taken off
  the west coast, however).  In modern terms: Clean and shell the
  lobster as indicated above. Mix the mustard, vinegar, catsup and
  cayenne to taste (some people might prefer to cut the sourness of the
  vinegar by substituting a half-and-half mixture of vinegar and dry
  white wine). Melt the butter in a large saucepan, saute the lobster
  briefly in it, not allowing it to color at all; then add the
  mustard/vinegar/cayenne mixture, mix well, cover, and allow to stew
  over medium heat for 15-20 minutes. Boiled new potatoes would go very
  well with this, or baked potatoes, or plain buttered rice. Thackeray
  and his friends seem to have not eaten anything else with the dish,
  but they seem to have drunk a great deal; he remarks in the next
  paragraph of the excerpt on ways to deal with the hangover....

  Here's my first attempt at scanning recipes using my new OCR stuff.
  Not bad.  It just took me about three times as long to diddle with
  the scanned image as it would have to type it in... Ah well, practice
  makes perfect. ;-}
  
  In Thai cooking, a pounded paste fresh coriander roots, black pepper
  corns and garlic makes a popular and useful spice mixture. This Thai
  trio-spice paste is used in the same way as Italian pesto to season
  stuffings, smear over meats as a marinade, or saute in oil to flavor
  stir-fried dishes. In this recipe, it serves to flavor the stuffing.
  
  Soak the bamboo skewers in water for at least 30 minutes.
  
  Keep the coriander bunch tied together and rinse it in a pan of cold
  water by dunking it up and down to dislodge the sand. Drain
  thoroughly and spin dry in a lettuce drier. Cut off the roots,
  including about 1 inch of the stem above the root; chop coarsely and
  set aside.
  
  To make the spice paste, pound the pepper corns in a mortar, or grind
  in a spice mill Add the garlic, coriander roots, sugar and salt;
  pound or grind into a smooth paste.
  
  Combine the spice paste, fish sauce, coriander leaves and chicken.
  
  Mix well.
  
  To devein and butterfly the prawns, make a 1/2 inch deep cut through
  the shell along the back with kitchen scissors.Pull out the black
  vein (the alimentary canal). Rinse prawns under cold running water
  and dry thoroughly.
  
  Starting from the tail end, thread the prawns lengthwise onto the
  skewers, ending at the head end. Spread open the 1/2-inch deep cut
  and stuff with about a teaspoonful of chicken paste; smooth the
  surface.
  
  Repeat with remaining prawns.
  
  Lightly brush prawns with oil.  Grill over a medium-hot fire for 1 to
  2 minutes on each side, or until they turn bright orange and feel
  firm to the touch.  They may also be broiled.  Serve with Sweet-Sour
  Cucumber Salad.
  
  SWEET AND SOUR CUCUMBER SALAD:
  
  Combine the vinegar, sugar , salt and water in a small bowl; stir
  until sugar and salt dissolve.  Put the cucumber slices in a shallow
  bowl, sprinkle with shrimp powder and fish sauce, then pour in the
  sweet vinegar to cover.  Top with coriander leaves.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

  While that's happening, process most of the herbs, the lime juice and
  the fish and soy sauces together. Leave some of the herbs for use as
  a garnish.
  
  When the meat is cooked, slice it thinly. Put the herb mix in the pan
  and heat through. Add the sliced meat, and simmer or a few minutes.
  Laty the meat on the salad, and spoon the sauce over it. Sprinkle the
  remaining herbs and some sliced chillies on top.

      Title: THAI CHICKEN & COCONUT MILK SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Thai
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     12 oz Canned coconut milk
           -- such as Chaokoh
    1/4 lb Chicken breast
           -- cut into small chunks
      1    Lime; juice and grated peel
      1    4" piece of lemon grass
           -- cut into very thin
           -- (1/16") slices on the
           -- diagonal
      3 sl Galanga (more if desired)
           --OR substitute fresh ginger
           Hot chile peppers to taste
           -- cut into thin circles
           Cilantro for garnish
 
  * Note: preferably Thai birds, with serranos an acceptable substitute,
  (though I've used sweet Fresno chiles in a variation I'll describe
  below).
  
  Instructions: ============= Pour the lime juice on the chicken and let
  stand while you prepare the rest of the soup. In a medium saucepan,
  place the coconut milk, lemon grass, grated lime peel, galanga or
  ginger, and (optionally) chiles. (The optional part is that if you
  don't want the whole dish to taste spicy, add the chiles later; the
  earlier you add them, the hotter the resulting dish.) Bring the
  coconut milk to a simmer.
  
  When the soup is simmering, add the lime-soaked chicken pieces and
  stir to distribute them.  Reduce the heat so the soup stays just
  below a boil and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or till the chicken
  pieces are finished cooking. Remove from heat and serve immediately
  with fresh cilantro leaves for garnish.
  
  Now, the *best* way I ever had this soup was with pieces of fresh
  grouper instead of chicken.  I also added slices of kumquats instead
  of the ginger, and used the sweet Fresno chiles instead of Thai
  birds. We also served it over Vietnamese rice noodles.  Was it
  southeast Asian or Caribbean? Who cares, it was wonderful. If you
  can't find grouper, it'd be good with any tender, delicate white fish
  ~- sole, maybe, or a very fresh sea bass, or maybe little chunks of
  monkfish. I believe I've had this with shrimp as well. (Grouper, BTW,
  is a type of fish common in the Caribbean and, if I recall, in other
  warm-water parts of the world; the flesh is very white, very tender,
  and quite delicately flavored. I've seen it in one Asian grocery
  store in the Bay Area, as well as in the Bahamas, so I'd guess that
  Gulf Coast netters should be able to find it readily.)
  
  Notes: ====== 1. Galanga is similar to ginger, an edible rhizome
  available in most Asian groceries. If not available fresh, you can
  usually find it frozen. (Well, this is the SF Bay Area; if you can't
  find it at Tin Tin or the New Castro Market, you have to have friends
  smuggle it in from Bangkok for you...  Other parts of the country may
  vary.)
  
  2.  Chile peppers add a lot to the dish; I've had it so hot that I
  could barely eat it, and I've had it completely smooth, sweet and
  mild. I like it in the middle.
  
  3.  Lemon grass adds a lot to the flavor and aroma, but as near as I
  can tell it isn't edible unless you puree it. (If there's sufficient
  demand, I'll print my recipe for Vietnamese turkey fajitas.) I just
  eat around the slices of lemon grass and ginger.

      1    4" piece of lemon grass
           -- cut into very thin
           -- (1/16") slices on the
           -- diagonal
      3 sl Galanga (more if desired)
           --OR substitute fresh ginger
           Hot chile peppers to taste
           -- cut into thin circles
           Cilantro for garnish
 
  * Note: preferably Thai birds, with serranos an acceptable substitute,
  (though I've used sweet Fresno chiles in a variation I'll describe
  below).
  
  Instructions: ============= Pour the lime juice on the chicken and let
  stand while you prepare the rest of the soup. In a medium saucepan,
  place the coconut milk, lemon grass, grated lime peel, galanga or
  ginger, and (optionally) chiles. (The optional part is that if you
  don't want the whole dish to taste spicy, add the chiles later; the
  earlier you add them, the hotter the resulting dish.) Bring the
  coconut milk to a simmer.
  
  When the soup is simmering, add the lime-soaked chicken pieces and
  stir to distribute them.  Reduce the heat so the soup stays just
  below a boil and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or till the chicken
  pieces are finished cooking. Remove from heat and serve immediately
  with fresh cilantro leaves for garnish.
  
  Now, the *best* way I ever had this soup was with pieces of fresh
  grouper instead of chicken.  I also added slices of kumquats instead
  of the ginger, and used the sweet Fresno chiles instead of Thai
  birds. We also served it over Vietnamese rice noodles.  Was it
  southeast Asian or Caribbean? Who cares, it was wonderful. If you
  can't find grouper, it'd be good with any tender, delicate white fish
  ~- sole, maybe, or a very fresh sea bass, or maybe little chunks of
  monkfish. I believe I've had this with shrimp as well.  (Grouper,
  BTW, is a type of fish common in the Caribbean and, if I recall, in
  other warm-water parts of the world; the flesh is very white, very
  tender, and quite delicately flavored. I've seen it in one Asian
  grocery store in the Bay Area, as well as in the Bahamas, so I'd
  guess that Gulf Coast netters should be able to find it readily.)
  
  Notes: ====== 1. Galanga is similar to ginger, an edible rhizome
  available in most Asian groceries. If not available fresh, you can
  usually find it frozen. (Well, this is the SF Bay Area; if you can't
  find it at Tin Tin or the New Castro Market, you have to have friends
  smuggle it in from Bangkok for you...  Other parts of the country may
  vary.)
  
  2.  Chile peppers add a lot to the dish; I've had it so hot that I
  could barely eat it, and I've had it completely smooth, sweet and
  mild. I like it in the middle.
  
  3.  Lemon grass adds a lot to the flavor and aroma, but as near as I
  can tell it isn't edible unless you puree it. (If there's sufficient
  demand, I'll print my recipe for Vietnamese turkey fajitas.) I just
  eat around the slices of lemon grass and ginger.

  Cook until the chicken is done and the soup is hot (30 minutes?).
  Taste to see if it needs more limes (it always does) or more hot

 Categories: Ethnic, Main dishes, Oriental, Poultry, Thai
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
           Spicy Peanut Sauce:
    1/2 c  Peanut butter
    1/2 c  Hoisin sauce
      1 tb Honey
      2 ts Red wine vinegar
      2 ts Ginger -- minced
      2 tb Roasted sesame oil
      2 ts Soy sauce
      1 ts Vietnamese chili sauce -- or
           Dried chili flake
      1 tb Oyster sauce
      2 tb Water
           Thai Chicken Pieces:
      1 tb Oilive oil
     10 oz Chicken breasts -- boned and
           Skinned
           Cut into 3/4" cubes
           For the Pizza:
      1    Recipe basic pizza dough
           Cornmeal, semolina or flour
           For handling
      2 c  Mozzarella cheese --
           Shredded
      4    Scallions -- slivered
           Diagonally
           Oriental style
    1/2 c  White bean sprouts
    1/4 c  Shredded carrot
      2 tb Roasted peanuts -- chopped
      2 tb Cilantro -- chopped, fresh
 
  To make spicy peanut sauce:  Combine sauce ingredients in a small pan
  over medium heat.  Bring the sauce to a boil; boil gently for one
  minute. Divide into two portions for use on chicken and pizza; set
  aside.
  
  To make Thai chicken:  Cook the chicken in olive oil over medium-high
  heat, stirring, until just cooked 5 to 6 minutes. Do not overcook.
  Set aside in the refrigerator until chilled through. Once chilled,
  coat the chicken with 1/4 cup Spicy Peanut Sauce.  Set aside in the
  refrigerator.
  
  To make the pizza:  Place pizza  stone in the center of the oven and
  preheat to 500 degreesF for one hour before cooking the pizzas.
  
  Use a large spoon to spread 1/4 cup spicy peanut sauce evenly over the
  surface of the prepared dough within the rim. Cover the sauce with
  3/4 cup shredded mozzarella.
  
  Distribute half the chicken pieces evenly over the cheese followed by
  half the green onions, bean sprouts and carrots, respectively.
  Sprinkle an additional 1/4 cup shredded mozzarella over the other
  other toppings and top the pizza with 1 tbs. chopped roasted peanuts.
  
  Transfer the pizza to the oven; bake until the crust is crisp and
  golden and the cheese at the center is bubbly, 9 to 10 minutes. When
  cooked through, carefully remove the pizza from the oven. Sprinkle 1
  tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro over the hot, cheese surface. Slice
  and serve. Repeat with remaining ingredients for a second pizza.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    Lemon grass; stalks
      3 tb Ginger, Siamese; sliced
      4    Garlic clove
      3    Peppercorns
      7    Coriander roots
     23    Shallots
      4 c  Coconut milk; medium-thick
      1 lb Chicken, breast; sliced
      5    Chilies, red; minced
      4 tb Fish sauce (nam pla)
      4 tb Lime juice
      5    Kaffir lime leaves; shredded
      3    Coriander sprigs; chopped
 
  The red chilies are also known as "prik khee nu". Wash lemon grass
  and trim root ends and tough layers. Slice bottom 6 inches thinly.
  Chop 1 T. of this. Puree chopped lemon grass, 1 T. of sliced ginger
  garlic, peppercorns, coriander roots and shallots. Bring 1 cup of
  coconut milk to boil and add lemon grass mixture. While stirring,
  reduce heat to medium and add chicken, remaining coconut milk, ginger
  slices and lemon grass. Bring to boil, reduce heat, and simmer
  uncovered until chicken is tender. Season with chilies, fish sauce
  and lime juice. Decorate servings with lime leaves and coriander
  sprigs.
  
  To make coconut milk: Blend 2 cups fresh or frozen grated coconut with
  water. Strain through double cheesecloth, pressing out all liquid.
  This is thick coconut milk. To get thin milk, add warm water to
  residue from first straining. Let stand 5 minutes, then press as
  before. For coconut cream, refrigerate first pressing and cream will
  rise to top. Refrigerate or freeze. Two cups coconut makes 3 cups
  thick milk, of which 6 tablespoons is cream.

 Categories: Thai, Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
     10    White peppercorns
           Mace
      1 ts Thai shrimp paste
      3    To 5 long red dried chillies
      4    Cloves shallots
    1/2    Stalk lemon grass
      1 ts Galangal
    1/2 ts Kaffir Lime Zest
      1 tb Chopped Coriander Root
    1/2 ts Salt
    250 ml Coconut Cream
      2 tb To 3 tb Red Curry Paste
      1 tb Fish Sauce
    1/2 tb Palm Sugar
     24    Coffin Bay Scallops
    125 ml Coconut Milk
      5    Kaffir Lime Leaves
      1 lg Fresh Red Chilli, Julienned
      2 tb Coriander Leaves
           Jasmine Rice
 
  A colleague who recently visited the Darley Street Thai at its new
  location in Bayswater Road, Kings Cross, described this dish as
  "exquisite". Though the recipe may seem dauntingly lengthy, most of
  it is simply a long list of ingredients for red curry paste, which
  can be made in quantity and stored in a container in the fridge for
  3-4 weeks for further use. Frozen kaffir limes can be bought very
  cheaply in good Asian stores, where the rest of the ingredients
  listed should also be avail- able. Grate the limes for zest while
  they are stir frozen.
  
  In a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, grind to a powder 10 white
  peppercorns and a few sheaves of mace. Roast 1 teaspoon of Thai shrimp
  paste by zapping it in a microwave oven or putting it on a little
  piece of foil under the grill.
  
  Put the pepper-mace mixture and the shrimp paste in a blender (David
  recommends a blender but some of us will have to make do with a food
  processor or the mortar and pestle) and add 3- 5 long red dried
  chillies, deseeded, washed and chopped, 4 cloves of true shallots,
  (or substitute the same quantity of Spanish onion), 1/2 stalk of
  lemon grass, sliced, 1 teaspoon galangal. peeled and chopped, 1/2
  teaspoon kaffir lime zest, 1 tablespoon of coriander root, scraped
  and chopped, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a little water. Process to a
  very fine paste. This may take up to 10 minutes. Transfer to a
  storage jar.
  
  In a medium-size pan, boil 250 mL coconut cream over high heat,
  stirring constantly, until the oil separates out, about 3-5 minutes.
  (If using canned coconut cream, don't shake the can -use the solid
  mass of coconut at the top of the can, plus as much of the rest as
  you need to make up 250mL. If it doesn't separate within 5 minutes,
  add a tablespoon of oil.) Add 2-3 tablespoons of red curry paste and
  fry for 5 minutes, stirring, until fra- grant. Add 1 tablespoon fish
  sauce, 1/2 tablespoon palm sugar and fry until colour deepens. Add 24
  Coffin Bay scallops (12 if other dishes will be served
  simultaneously) and 125 mL coconut milk. Check for sweet-sour
  balance. Throw in 5 kaffir lime leaves, shredded, 1 large fresh red
  chilli, julienned, and 2 tablespoons of either coriander or basil
  leaves. Serve with jasmine rice.

    1/4 c  Cilantro, chopped
      2 ea Jalapeno chiles, seeded &
           -- minced
      2 ea Garlic cloves, minced
      1 ts Ginger, minced
      3 tb Sesame oil
      2 tb Rice vinegar
      1 tb Lime juice
           Salt, to taste
 
  In a large bowl, combine corn, beans, celery, onion, pepper, cilantro,
  chiles, garlic & ginger.  Set aside.
  
  In another bowl, whisk together oil, vinegar & lime juice. Pour over
  the ingredients in the large bowl & mix well. Season with salt &
  chill until ready to serve.
  
  MARK'S NOTE: I am not sure what makes this "Thai", however the taste
  is not bad.  I especially like using black beans in contrast with
  other bright colours.  I used galangal in place of ginger in this
  recipe plus a pinch of lemongrass.  I replaced the red onion with a
  couple of large green onions, chopped.
  
  Next time, I'll use red chiles rather than jalapeno chiles.
  Jalapenoes, especially when seeded, do not have much taste. A couple
  of red chiles, finely minced should go a long way towards perking up
  an otherwise promising dish.  Oh yes, do increase the lime juice. I
  used as much juice as I could squeeze out of half a large lime & it
  could have still used more, so 1 tb is not nearly enough.  Try
  garnishing with kaffir lime leaves as well.

      Title: THAI CRAB ROLLS
 Categories: Thai, Appetizers
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Thai dipping sauce:
      1 c  Distilled white vinegar
    1/2 c  Light brown sugar; plus 4
           -teaspoons
  1 1/2 tb Minced garlic
      1 tb Crushed dried red pepper
    1/3 c  Fish sauce; *see cook's
           -notes, below
           Crabmeat filling:
      2 tb Unsalted butter; or olive
           -oil
      2 ts Minced garlic
    1/3 c  Onion; chopped
    1/3 c  Celery; chopped
    1/3 c  Shredded carrot
      3    Fresh shiitake mushroom caps
           -- coarsely  chopped
      1 c  Lump crabmeat; fresh or
           -drained canned, well
           Picked over
      1 tb Fish sauce; *see cook's
           -notes, or salt to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper,
           -to taste
     10    Spring roll wrappers; 8
           -inch square
      1 tb All-purpose flour; mixed
           -with 1 tablespoon cold
           -Water to form a paste
           Vegetable oil, for deep
           -frying
 
  PREPARE THE SAUCE:
      Combine the vinegar and sugar in a small saucepan and bring the
  mixture to a boil over moderate heat. Boil just until the sugar is
  dissolved. Transfer the liquid to a small bowl. Add the garlic,
  pepper, and fish sauce.  Set aside. MAKE THE FILLING:
      Melt the butter in a skillet over moderate heat. Add the garlic
  and onion and cook until the onion is translucent, about 2 minutes.
  Add the celery, carrot and mushrooms, and saute until the vegetables
  are soft but not browned, about 2 minutes.  Add the crabmeat, fish
  sauce and black pepper and toss well.  Transfer the filling to a bowl
  and cool completely. ASSEMBLE THE ROLLS:
      Stack the spring roll wrappers.  Using a sharp knife or scissors,
  cut the stacked wrappers in half along the diagonal. Work with one
  triangle at a time, keeping the remaining wrappers covered with a
  damp kitchen towel to prevent drying.
      Place a triangle smooth side down on a work surface, with the
  long edge nearest you.  Lightly brush the sheet with the flour paste.
  Place 2 heaping teaspoons of the filling along the lower edge of the
  wrapper, [then fold in points at the side over filling] and then roll
  up from the bottom to enclose the filling. Place the roll seam side
  down on a large plate and keep covered with a damp towel while you
  fill and roll the remaining triangles.
      Preheat the oven to 250F.  Line a baking sheet with paper towels.
  COOK THE ROLLS:
      Heat 2 inches of oil in a wok or deep heavy skillet to 350F.
  Gently add the rolls in batches and cook, turning occasionally, until
  golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a sieve
  set over a large bowl to drain.  Transfer the rolls to the baking
  sheet and keep warm in the oven while you cook the remaining rolls.
      Serve the rolls with the dipping sauce. VARIATION: Crabmeat
  Triangles: Cut each spring roll wrapper into 3 strips. Place 2
  teaspoons of the filling on a bottom corner of each strip and fold up
  and over flag-style to form triangles.  Brush the end with flour
  paste before the last fold to seal.  Fry and serve with the sauce as
  above.
      If you prefer to bake rather than fry these treats, wrap up the
  filling flag-style in strips of phyllo pastry to form triangles,
  spray or brush with butter, and bake in a preheated 375F oven until
  golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Serve the triangles on their
  own, without sauce. *Cook's Notes:  When buying fish sauce, look for
  the Squid or Tiparos brand. Once opened, fish sauce lasts up to a
  year at room temperature. Fish sauce is available in Asian markets
  and in some well-stocked supermarkets.
      Cooked salmon, lobster meat, or chicken may be substituted for the
  crabmeat.
      For additional flavor and texture, wrap the fried rolls in tender
  lettuce leaves, along with some sprigs of mint and coriander, before
  dipping into the sauce. Yield: 20 rolls for hors d'oeuvres, or enough
  for 4 to 6 appetizer servings. Source: Cooking Under Wraps

      1 ts Heaping whole caraway
           Seeds OR
      1 ts Ground caraway
    1/2    Lemon's zest, minced
      2    Inch piece ginger root,
           Peeled and minced
      8 cl Garlic, peeled and minced
      4    Shallots, peeled and
           Minced
      1 ts Anchovy paste
      6    Sprigs coriander, finely
           Chopped
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Vegetable oil
 
  Grind the whole spices and add any ground ones.  Into a food
  processor, pour the mixture and add the remaining ingredients (except
  for 1 tablespoon of the oil. Grind as fine as possible. Using a
  spatula, transfer the paste to a jar and pour in the last tablespoon
  of oil. Cap tightly and refrigerate until needed. Keeps 2 months in
  the refrigerator. Makes approximately 8 ounces.
  
  NOTES:  Although substitutions for hard-to-find ingredients have been
  made,
        this curry paste still carries the true flavor of Thailand. Use
  it in
        Thai curries unless otherwise specified.  A little added to
  stir-fry
        dishes or rubbed into chicken as a marinade before barbequing or
        grilling will add a real Thai accent.  A teaspoon added to a
  meatloaf
        mixture or meat balls, transforms them into something that is
  rather
        exotic, and when combined with peanut butter and coconut milk,
  it
        makes a tangy and aromatic sauce for Thai-style satays.
  
        Use whole spices whenever possible.  Anchovy fillets may be
        substituted for the anchovy paste.  Shallots are preferable to
  onions;
        if not available, use an equal amount of a red onion.

           Stephen Ceideburg
      8    Cloves Garlic, Crushed
      2 tb Minced Corriander Root
      2 tb Fish Sauce
  1 1/2 tb Brown Sugar
    1/2 ts Sugar
  1 1/4 lb Cleaned Prawns
           Oil For Frying
 
  Spanish garlic prawns are yesterday's fashion, but are still so
  enjoyable that most of us are prepared to eat them and to hell with
  friends and colleagues next day. Perhaps the vast quantity of
  coriander root in this Thai version has magical properties because
  the after-math doesn't seem to be severe.
  
  Prepare a marinade by mixing together 8 crushed cloves of garlic, 2
  tablespoons washed and minced coriander root, 2 table- spoons fish
  sauce, 1.5 tablespoons brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add 500 g
  of shelled and cleaned prawns and leave to marinate for 15-30 minutes.
  
  Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a frying pan, add the prawns and their
  marinade and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes or just until the prawns are
  pink. Stir in the juice of a lemon and serve immediately with rice
  and sliced tomatoes and cucumber.

      3 tb Lime juice
      2 tb Nam pla (Thai fish sauce)
      1 ts Sugar
      3    Shallots, peeled, thinly
           -sliced
    1/2 c  Fresh coriander leaves
      6 oz Cooked bay shrimp
           Shredded lettuce
      1 tb To 2 tb crisp-fried shallots
           -(optional)
 
  This recipe comes from the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok, location of the
  Thai Cooking School.  It has been adapted for the American cook. With
  this recipe it's necessary to use mung bean glass noodles rather than
  those based on rice flour.  Check the ingredients on the package when
  buying.
  
  Put mung bean noodles in a bowl and pour in lukewarm water to cover.
  Let soak until soft and pliable (about 15 minutes). Drain. Add
  noodles to a large pot of boiling water. reduce to medium heat; cook
  until noodles are plump and glass like (3 to 5 minutes). Drain in a
  colander; rinse with cold water; drain again. Cut into 3 or 4 inch
  lengths.
  
  Chill.
  
  Pour oil into a hot wok or skillet.  Add chicken; saute until it
  loses it's pink color.  Break into small morsels. Season with salt
  and pepper to taste. Cool.
  
  Mix together chile, lime juice, nam pla, sugar, shallots and
  coriander; pour over noodles and mix thoroughly. Add chicken, shrimp
  and chilled noodles; mix well.
  
  Serve on a bed of shredded lettuce.  Garnish with the optional crisp
  fried shallots.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.
  
  NOTE:  Crisp fried shallots are available in Asian grocery stores.
  
  San Francisco Chronicle, 8/29/90.
  
  As far as the crisp fried shallots go, they're easy to make. Just fry
  some sliced shallots in a little oil until they're browned and crisp.
  I wouldn't hesitate to substitute dried onion flakes fried in the
  same way... I add them to a lot of Thai soups for an extra flavor
  accent. Good stuff!

      1 ts Ground Dried Shrimp w/Chiles
           - (optional)
      2    Garlic cloves; chopped
      2    Red serrano chiles; sliced

  1. Place tea in a coffee filter in a drip cone. Preheat carafe with
  boiling water; discard water. Pour 6 ounces boiling water per serving
  into cone and let it drip through. Transfer brew to another
  container, then pour back through filter. Repeat until tea is deep
  red in color, a total of 4 to 6 times.
  
  2. Sweeten tea to taste with sugar or condensed milk. Fill tall
  glasses with ice cubes and add tea to fill glasses halfway. Add milk
  or half-and-half and stir.
  
  Variation: The tea may be brewed in a teapot, but it will still need
  to be filtered through a paper filter or a very fine nylon strainer.
  Preheat pot with boiling water and allow to steep 6 to 8 minutes
  before straining.

      5 lb Melons
      2    Or 3 Serrano chiles
      5 oz Lime juice
      1 oz Thai fish sauce (nam pla)
  1 1/4 oz Palm or coconut sugar (or
           -brown sugar)
      3 oz Ground peanuts
    1/2 oz Dried shrimp
    1/2 tb Crushed lime leaves *
    3/4 ts Garlic puree
           Cilantro leaves, for garnish
 
  * I assume she means "makrut" or Thai lime leaves. S.C.
  
  This recipe, from the City Restaurant and Border Grill in Los Angeles,
  presents melons in a sweet and savory context. In order to have a
  contrast of colors and flavors, use portions of several melons. The
  recipe calls for approximately 2 pounds of prepared melon about half
  a pound per person. The specialty items may be found in Thai grocery
  stores.
  
  Cut the melons into small dice or thin ribbons. Arrange on a platter.
  
  Place the chiles, lime juice, fish sauce, palm sugar, pea- nuts, dried
  shrimp, crushed lime leaves and garlic puree in a blender; blend until
  thoroughly mixed. Pour over the salad and garnish with cilantro
  leaves.

  IN 2 SEPARATE MEDIUM BOWLS, soak bean thread noodles and tree ears in
  warm water until soft and pliable (about 15 minutes). Drain the
  noodles and cut into 1-inch lengths; set aside. Drain and rinse off
  sand from tree ears. Pinch off and discard hard centers; coarsely
  chop and set aside. Pound peppercorns, garlic and coriander roots
  into a coarse paste, or chopped together in a spice mill. Combine
  pork, shrimp or crab, fish sauce, peppercorn mixture, and 1 teaspoon
  of the sugar. Add shallots, carrots, bean sprouts, and the reserved
  bean thread noodles and tree ears; mix together thoroughly. Dissolve

  bottom of rice paper over filling. Fold left and right sides over
  each end to enclose filling. Continue rolling until completely
  sealed. Repeat with remaining filling. Preheat wok until hot. Add
  enough oil to a depth of 3-inches. Heat to 325F. Add a few rolls and
  deep-fry for 10 seconds. Immediately increase to high heat or 375F
  and deep-fry until crisp and golden brown (about 6 minutes). Remove
  and drain. Serve wrapped in a lettuce leaf with a mint leaf. Dip into
  Thai Spring Roll Dip.
  
  THAI SPRING ROLL DIP: Combine sugar, water and vinegar in a saucepan
  over medium-high heat; boil until reduced to 3/4 cup of liquid.
  Remove from heat and stir in the fish sauce and chile flakes. When
  cooled, transfer to a dipping saucer and mix in coriander and
  peanuts. Makes about 24 rolls with sauce.

 Categories: Thai, Pasta
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Dried rice noodles 1/8" wide
           -Warm water
    1/2 lb Shrimp, chicken or pork
           -OR- a combination
    1/4 c  Fish sauce
    1/4 c  Granulated sugar; PLUS:
      2 tb Granulated sugar
    1/4 c  White vinegar: PLUS:
      2 tb White vinegar
      1 ts Paprika; -OR-
      1 tb -Tomato paste -OR-
      1 tb -Catsup (all are optional)
      4    Green onions
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      1 ts Finely chopped garlic
      2    Eggs
    3/4 lb Bean sprouts
      2 tb Ground roasted chilies
    3/4 c  Ground roasted peanuts
           -- (unsalted)
           Lime wedges
 
  1.  Soak the noodles for 20-25 minutes in enough warm water to cover
  them. They should be flexible and soft, but not so soft that they can
  be mashed easily with the fingers. Later cooking in liquid will
  soften them more. Drain them thoroughly in a colander while preparing
  the other ingredients. Traditionally they are left in full-length
  strands, but you may cut them into 8-inch lengths if you find it
  easier to stir-fry them that way.
  
  2.  Peel and devein the shrimp, leaving the tails intact, or slice the
  chicken or pork across the grain into strips not more than 1/8 inch
  thick and 1 to 2 inches long.
  
  3.  Mix the fish sauce, sugar, vinegar, and optional paprika, tomato
  paste, or catsup in a bowl, and stir until the sugar is dissolved.
  Set the mixture aside. Slice the green onions, both white and green
  parts, diagonally into pieces 1 1/2 inches long and 1/4 inch thick.
  Set aside.
  
  4.  Heat a wok, add the oil, and swirl it over the surface of the
  pan. Add the garlic and stir-fry until light golden. Add the meat and
  stir-fry until the pink color disappears completely. If you are using
  shrimp, stir-fry until they turn pink.  Add the noodles and toss
  lightly to coat them with oil and to distribute the meat and garlic.
  
  5.  Add the liquid from Step 3 and bring it to a boil rapidly, gently
  folding the noodles without breaking them. Reduce the heat to medium
  and boil the mixture, folding frequently, until the noodles have
  absorbed the liquid.
  
  6.  Using a wok scoop or a stiff spatula, lift the noodles gently
  from one side of the wok.  Pour a little oil along the side of the
  wok, then break 1 egg and slip it into the oil. Break the yolk, and
  cover the egg with the noodles immediately.  Repeat this on the
  opposite side of the wok with the remaining egg. Allow the eggs to
  cook undisturbed, over moderate heat, until they are set and almost
  dry. Additional oil may be added if the eggs or the noodles begin to
  stick to the wok.
  
  7.  When the eggs are set and almost dry, fold them gently but
  rapidly into the noodles.  Try not to break the noodles, which will
  be soft and fragile at this point. An effective way is to insert the
  scoop under the eggs, lift it through, and fold the mixture over.
  Continue the lifting and folding motion until the eggs are broken up
  and well distributed.
  
  8.  Add the bean sprouts and sliced green onions and toss the entire
  mixture quickly and gently, still avoiding breaking the noodles. Cook
  for about 2 minutes, or until the bean sprouts and green onions are
  crisp-tender.
  
  9.  Place the mixture on a large warm platter. Sprinkle the ground
  chilies and peanuts over the top and squeeze lime juice over that, or
  serve these garnishes separately, for each diner to add according to
  taste.
  
  Variation: ========== Omit the shrimp, pork, or chicken from the list
  of ingredients, and ignore any instructions for them. Substitute 1/2
  pound tofu and 1/4 pound dried shrimp. Put the tofu on a triple layer
  of paper towels, cover it with another triple layer, put a plate on
  top of that, and put a 2-pound weight, e.g. a can of tomatoes, on top
  of the plate. Let stand for 20 to 30 minutes to press out the excess
  water. Put the dried shrimp in a sieve, rinse them quickly under hot
  running water, and set them aside to drain. After the tofu has been
  pressed, slice it into 1/4-inch cubes.  Add the tofu and shrimp in
  Step 5 of the instructions and proceed with the main recipe. Note: in
  Thailand, dried shrimp are available in a smaller size than is
  generally available in the United States. If you would like to
  simulate that, chop the dried shrimp very coarsely after they have
  been rinsed.

 Categories: Thai, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  This recipe is very simple,very fast and very good. The fresh rice
  noodles, thick and white, can be found in the refrigerator cabinet of
  any good Asian grocery store. Don't use frozen marinara mix++the
  recipe deserves better. Any decent fishmonger will be happy to serve
  you with half a dozen prawns, a few scallops, some squid, a small
  fillet of fish, a handful of mussels or any other combination that
  appeals to you.
  
  Cut 500 g of mixed seafood into bite-size pieces, first removing any
  shells.  If you are using mussels, wash and scrape the shells and
  open them by putting them in a pot with a little boiling water. Cover
  and boil for a few minutes, removing each mussel as it opens to
  prevent overcooking.
  
  Chop a handful of basil leaves and seed and finely slice 3 bird's eye
  chillies.
  
  In a frying pan or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of oil. Brown 2 tablespoons
  of crushed garlic and saute the seafood for a couple of minutes.
  Drain off the oil and set the garlic seafood mixture aside.
  
  Put another tablespoon of oil in the pan and increase the heat. Add 2
  tablespoons of light soya sauce and the noodles and saute for 2-3
  minutes. Tip the seafood back into the pan and add 3 tablespoons of
  fish sauce. Stir well.  Add the basil leaves and chillies and cook
  for 1 minute more, stirring.  Serve,
  
  Makes 3 to 4 servings.

  SALAD: Arrange the lettuce, tomatoes, onion, carrot & cucumber in a
  salad bowl & lightly toss.  Add the bean curd & sprouts. Top with the
  peanut- coconut milk dressing & garnish with potato chips. DRESSING:
  In saucepan over medium heat, stir the coconut milk & red curry paste
  together until the mixture turns to a pale amber & a thin coat of oil
  appears on the surface. Add the remaining ingredients & stir over a
  low heat for 7 to 10 minutes, or until all the ingredients are
  thoroughly mixed. The colour will be a pale cocoa brown. Let cool to
  room temperature for 1 hour before serving with the salad. The
  dressing will keep in the refrigerator for a month, but it does have
  a tendency to thicken.  To bring it back to its correct consistency,
  add 1/2 ts to 1 tb white vinegar & stir vigorously.

           -=OR=- Dutch oven
 
  Golden Mountain Sauce is prepared with Thai style-soy sauce, which
  may be found in Southeast Asian markets.
  
  IN A BOWL, COVER MUNG BEAN noodles with warm water; soak until soft
  and pliable, about 10 minutes. Drain. Set aside. Clean and prepare
  the live crab according to the following instructions (if using
  cooked crab, follow the instructions after the steaming step). Shell
  and devein the shrimp; pat dry. Clean squid according to the
  instructions below. Cut the body crosswise into 1-inch rings; set
  aside the rings and cleaned tentacles. In a mortar or spice mill,
  pound or grind the peppercorns, coriander root and garlic into a
  paste. In a bowl, mix together the sugar, Golden Mountain Sauce, soy
  sauce, oyster sauce, rice wine and sesame oil. Add oil to clay pot or
  Dutch oven. Set over medium heat. Add reserved
  coriander-garlic-pepper paste to the oil; saute lightly. Increase to
  high heat. Add ginger, chiles and the crab pieces (add cooked crab
  later); toss and brown for a minute. Add shrimp and green onions to
  crab mixture; stir-fry for 30 seconds. Pour in the soy sauce mixture
  and mung bean noodles; toss and mix together. Stir in water, cover
  pot, reduce to medium heat and simmer for 8 minutes, stirring
  occasionally. If noodles seem dry, add more water. Increase to
  medium-high heat, add fish, squid and cooked crab, mix with the
  noodles, top with the basil leaves. Cover. Cook 3 to 5 minutes
  longer. Check for doneness. Bring the clay pot to the table and serve
  hot with rice and vegetables.
  
  TO CLEAN AND PREPARE THE CRAB: Scrub the underside and in between
  claws and legs to loosen sand and grit. Rinse well with cold water.
  Plunge crab into boiling water for a minute to kill it immediately.
  Remove and cool. To disjoint and crack the crab, hold shell portion
  of the crab in one hand. With the other hand, gather the legs and
  claws on one side and gently pull and tug until the body and legs
  loosen and free themselves as a whole section from the shell. On both
  sides of the body are featherly gills. Pull off and discard these
  gills. The tail piece, a triangular flap, is located on the underside
  of the body. With tip of knife lift up the flap, grasp it, twist off
  and discard. Scrub exposed area clean. Now remove the legs and claws
  by gently pulling and bending them backward against their natural
  bend, and twist to free them. You now have the chest-body section
  where the tomalley liver is embedded in the cavity. Spoon it out and
  reserve it for those who appreciate it. The chest body should be
  chopped in half down the middle with a heavy cleaver. Chop each
  section crosswise into 3 equal pieces. With a light hammer or metal
  nut cracker, crack the mid section and joint of each leg and claw;
  set aside the pieces. (When eating, use the tip of the leg as a pick
  to dig out the meat.)
  
  TO CLEAN AND PREPARE SQUID: Grasp the body of the squid with one hand
  and with the other pull the head and tentacles away until separated
  from the body. With your finger dip into the body to remove the
  quill, the transparent cartilage and discard. Peel off the dotted
  skin from the body and discard. Rinse body with cold water. Cut
  between the eye and the tentacles; discard the head. Squeeze the
  thick center part of the tentacles to dislodge the hard beak. Rinse
  with cold water; set aside.

 Categories: Thai, Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Chicken (4 to 5 pounds)
           Salt
      2 qt Water
      3    Stalks fresh lemon grass
      8 sl Fresh galangal (or fresh
           -ginger)
      6    Garlic cloves, smashed
      6    Fresh Thai "bird" chiles *
      8    Shallots, sliced
      6    Fresh kaffir lime leaves
           -(optional)
    1/4 c  Thai fish sauce (nam pla)
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/4 c  Fresh lime juice
    1/2 c  Tightly packed fresh
           -coriander leaves
    1/4 c  Fresh Thai basil leaves,
           -cut into thin strips
      1 ts Black pepper
 
  * (or 4 Serranos), cut into coarse strips, seeds and all.
  
  Salt the chicken inside and out and let stand for 30 minutes to an
  hour.
  
  In a pot the chicken will fit in snugly, bring water to a boil. Add
  the chicken and when the water returns to a boil, skim the foam. Cut
  off the bottom 1/3 of the lemon grass stalk, discarding the rest. Cut
  the bottom on the bias into oval slices and add to the pot along with
  the galangal, garlic, chiles, shallots and kaffir lime leaves (if you
  can find them).
  
  Turn the heat to medium-low, partially cover the pot, and simmer for
  30 minutes.  Then add the fish sauce, sugar and up to 2 teaspoons of
  salt (or to taste). Simmer until the skin near the wing starts to
  split, about 30 more minutes, then remove the chicken to a large,
  round serving bowl leaving the stock in the pot. Cover the chicken to
  keep warm.
  
  Add the lime juice to the broth as well as the coriander and basil
  leaves. Pour the broth over the chicken, sprinkle with the black
  pepper and serve.
  
  The chicken should pull off the bone easily; it's best eaten from
  bowls with some of the broth and herbs poured over.

      1    Text Only
 
  Is there a cuisine which doesn't have a version of stuffed tomatoes?
  The filled vegetables are always good but this Thai interpretation is
  quite different.
  
  Cut the tops off 10 tomatoes and set them aside to be used later as
  lids. Scoop out the seeds and internal flesh of the tomatoes, leaving
  the fleshy shell. Lightly salt the interiors and stand the tomatoes
  upside down in a rack to drain.
  
  Pound in a mortar or process together the well-washed roots of a
  bunch of coriander, 4 cloves of garlic, 1/2 onion and 10 peppercorns
  (better use coarsely ground pepper if processing). Remove this
  mixture to a bowl and add 250 g minced pork, 250 g cooked crab meat
  (tinned can be used if necessary), 1 teaspoon sugar, 2 tablespoons
  fish sauce and 1 egg. Mix well rinse out and dry the tomato cases,
  stuff with the mixture and replace the lids.  Bake in a preheated
  180C oven for half an hour.
  
  Makes 5 servings.

 Categories: Mango, Asian, Thai
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Glutinous rice (see notes)
  3 1/2 c  Coconut milk (see notes)
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      6    Mangoes-ripe,peeled & sliced
           (actually 4 to 6 depending
           On the size)
 
  GLUTINOUS RICE: Glutinous or sweet rice is a white, short-grained
  rice that has a sticky consistency when cooked. It can be found in
  Asian markets and many markets with asian specialty sections. CANNED
  COCONUT MILK: Canned coconut milk also is sold in Asian markets and
  some supermarkets with Asian specialty sections. Do not confuse this
  product with the water inside the coconut. SHORTCUT: A Japanese rice
  cooker can make short work of cooking the glutinous rice. Rather than
  soaking the rice, rinse it 3 times in cold water and drain.  Cook
  rice according  to manufacturer's directions. PROCEDURE: Cover rice
  with water and soak at least 6 hours or overnight (see shortcut). A
  couple of hours or so before serving, drain rice and spread on a
  cheesecloth-lined section of a steamer; steam for 45 minutes. During
  the steaming, sprinkle the rice 2 times with 1/4 cup water.
  Meanwhile, over medium heat using a Dutch oven or large saucepan,
  simmer the coconut milk on medium-low heat until it is reduced by
  one-third in volume.  Use caution toward the end of simmering,
  because the coconut milk can sen spouts of liquid 2 or 3 inches above
  the pan toward the end of the simmering time if it is too hot. Remove
  from heat and stir in sugar and salt. When rice is finished steaming
  and has rested for 10 minutes, blend it with the warm, sweetened
  coconut milk; allow to stand for 10 minutes. Immediately arrange rice
  on platter and place mango on top. Serve.

        1 TB oyster sauce
        1 ts Asian chili sauce
      1/2 ts curry powder
      1/2 ts sugar
  
  Advance preparation: In a bowl, combine the green onions, ginger,
  veal, oyster sauce, rice wine and chile sauce. Mix thoroughly. Place
  2 teaspoons filling in the center of a wrapper. (If using square
  wonton wrappers, trim them into circles.) Bring edges of wrapper up
  around filling and encircle the dumpling "waist" with your index
  finger and thumb. Squeeze the waist gently with that same index
  finger, while also pressing the top and the bottom of the dumpling
  with your other index finger and thumb. Line a baking sheet with
  parchment paper, dust paper heavily with cornstarch, place dumplings
  on the baking sheet, and refrigerate uncovered. Set aside the cooking
  oil. Combine all sauce ingredients and mix well. All advance
  preparation steps may be completed up to 8 hours before you begin the
  final cooking steps. Final cooking steps: Place a 12-inch nonstick
  saute pan over high heat.  Add cooking oil and immediately add
  dumplings bottom side down. Fry dumplings until bottoms become dark
  golden, about 2 minutes. Pour in sauce.  Immediately cover pan,
  reduce heat to medium, and steam dumplings until they are firm to the
  touch, about 2 minutes. Shake the pan so that the dumplings "capsize"
  and are glazed all over with the sauce. Tip out onto a heated serving
  platter or 4 heated dinner plates. Serve at once. Suggested
  accompaniments: Roasted baby beets, a Cobb salad, and raspberries
  with Grand Marnier truffles. Serves 6 to 10 as an appetizer or 4 as
  the main entree.

  Thailand is truly a place for seafood lovers.  There is water
  everywhere in Bangkok++even in the dry season. And everywhere there
  is water, the Thais use it to grow something to eat! Add to that the
  fact that the Gulf of Thailand is not far away from the city and it
  all adds up to good eatin' for seafood lover's! The following recipe
  is typical of the bewildering variety of cioppino and jambalaya type
  seafood stews found there++and each one seems better than the last.
  The recipe is from Joyce Jue's delightful San Francisco Chronicle
  column (3/13/91). It calls for the dish to be cooked in a Chinese
  "sandy" pot. Don't gots one? Not to worry++use whatever you have on
  hand++wok, Dutch oven, stockpot...
  
  (And yes, Marge++there are tentacles in this!)
  
  Put the mung beans into a bowl and cover with warm water; soak until
  soft and pliable, about 10 minutes. Drain. Set aside. If you are
  using a cooked crab, have the fishmonger crack it into large pieces.
  
  To clean a live crab, be careful, and use a brush to scrub its
  underside and between the claws and legs to loosen the sand and grit.
  Rinse thoroughly with cold water. Plunge the crab into boiling water
  for a minute to kill it.  Remove.  When cool, clean, disjoint and
  chop the crab into large chunks.
  
  In a mortar or spice mill, pound or grind the peppercorns first, then
  add the coriander root and garlic, and work it into a paste. Mix
  together the sugar, Golden Mountain, soy and oyster sauces, rice wine
  and sesame oil in a bowl.
  
  Pour the vegetable oil into a 3 1/2-quart sandy clay pot casserole
  (or a Dutch oven) and set over medium heat. Add the coriander-garlic-
  pepper paste and saute lightly.
  
  Increase the heat to high.  Add ginger, chiles and raw crab pieces;
  toss and brown for a minute.  Add the shrimp an green onions to crab
  mixture; stir-fry for 30 seconds. Pour in the soy sauce mixture and
  mung bean noodles; toss and mix together.  Stir in the water, cover
  pot, reduce heat to medium and braise for 8 minutes, stirring
  occasionally. If the noodles seem dry, add more water.
  
  Increase heat to medium-high, and gently stir in the fish and squid
  (and cooked crab if using), mix with the noodles, top with the basil
  leaves. Cover and cook for 3 to 5 minutes longer. Check for doneness.
  Garnish with fresh coriander sprigs.  Bring the clay pot to the table
  and serve hot with rice and vegetables.
  
  Serves 4.

      2 ts Crushed garlic

      2 tb Oyster sauce*
      1    2 teaspoons sugar
        x  Fresh basil leaves (Thai or
           Oly basil is best, Italian
           Or sweet is ok)
 
  Saute the tempe cubes in oil until golden but not burned. Remove &
  drain on paper towels.
  
  Stir fry carrots in 1 tablespoon oil for 3-4 minutes, until slightly
  soft. Add the garlic & chilis for 30 seconds, stir, then add tempe &
  mix it all up.
  
  Add oyster sauce & sugar.  Stir fry for 2 minutes.
  
  Mix in basil & serve with a mound of steamed rice.

  no oyster extract, only caramel & soy.

      Title: THAI-STYLE~ SPICY EGGPLANT-MUSHROOM SAUCE
 Categories: Thai, Digest
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Mushrooms
      1 md Shallot
      2 md Garlic cloves
    1/2 ts Hunan style red chili paste
  1 1/2 c  Rice milk or milk
           -substitute
      1 lb Eggplant
      1 md Red bell pepper
    1/2 c  Chopped asparagus stems
           -(originally this was peas)
    1/2 c  Fresh basil leaves
      2 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Plum sauce
    1/2 ts Ginger
    1/4 c  Veggie stock
      2    3 drops toasted sesame oil
      2 ts Tapioca flour (see note)
 
  Mince garlic and shallot; quarter mushrooms, dice eggplant into 1-inch
  cubes and slice red bell pepper into long strips.
  
  In a large frying pan, on medium head add stock and mushrooms. Simmer
  for 5 minutes or until mushrooms are tender and brown. Remove
  mushrooms and set aside. In remaining stock add shallot and garlic,
  sautee for 1-2 minutes. Add chili paste and milk.  Bring mixture to a
  boil then reduce heat and simmer on low for 5 minutes, stirring
  often. Add sugar, plum sauce and sesame oil (only a few drops!  It's
  amazing the flavor it adds). Add eggplant, asparagus stems and red
  bell pepper. Bring mixture back up to a boil.  Cover and simmer for
  15 minutes stirring occasionally until eggplant and asparagus are
  tender. In the last 5 minutes add mushrooms and fresh basil leaves.
  
  Serve over grilled polenta (recipe follows) or rice and the steamed
  asparagus tips.
  
  Note: When I made this recipe I felt that the sauce was too thin. The
  original recipe called for coconut milk and olive oil as the sauce's
  base. How I remedied this problem was as follows: I removed all the
  vegetables from the pan using a slotted spoon and turned the heat
  down to the lowest setting.  I placed them in the serving bowl and
  set aside. In a measuring cup I added 1/3 cup cold water and 2
  heaping teaspoons of tapioca flour (not pearls).  Once this was
  thoroughly mixed I poured it into the sauce while stirring with the
  slotted spoon. In less than a minute the sauce had thickened very
  nicely.  I then poured the sauce into the bowl over the vegetables
  and served. It was pleasantly spicy (go light on the red chili paste
  if you dislike REALLY hot foods) and filling.
  
  Note2:  if you wanted to be more authentic you could try adding some
  coconut extract...

  Some people call it dressing, and some call it stuffing, but everyone
  calls it delicious. And it is apart of every Thanksgiving table I can
  remember! How about you? However you try and say it it's good! It
  means a family traditions gathering around the kitchen with the
  family while you make the stuffing to go inside of the turkey out out
  side of the turkey. Oh the smells of the kitchen will bring you all
  home for sure.. Stuffing is as American as Apple Pie, and baseball.
  Weather you call it Dressing or stuffing it is a savory well seasoned
  mixture of bread on bread. If your from the deep South you most
  likely use corn bread, and if your from the Cajiun country yu might
  like oysters, and french bread and articoke hearts. However you fix
  it, or how ever you serve it. It's family traditions that matter.
  It's the memories that will last a life time to share with our
  friends and families now.. Here's a Southern Cornbread Stuffing that
  one of my favorites.
  
  DIRECTIONS:
  
  TO MAKE THE CORN BREAD: Combine first 5 ingred. in a large bowl stir
  well. Combine milk,oil and egg add to flour mixture.. Stirring just
  until dry ingred. are moistened Spoon batter into a 8 inch square
  baking pan. coated with cooking spray (Pam) Bake at 425 for 20 min.
  or until center comes out clean. Makes 8 servings. When corn bread is
  done cool on wire rack and crumble corn bread and set aside until
  ready to mix with the move ingred.
  
  Melt margarine in large skillet over medium heat add onion, celery and
  water and cover. Reduce heat to medium low and cook 15 minutes or
  until tender. Remove from heat stir in poultry seasoning, sage, salt
  and white bread. Combine crumbled corn bread, onion and bread
  mixture, chicken broth, parsley and egg in a bowl and stir well.
  Spoon mixture into a 2-qt casserole coated with Pam (vegetable
  non-stick spray) Bake uncovered at 325 for 35 min.

 Categories: Kids, Play dough, Crafts, Holidays
      Yield: 1 Batch clay
 
MMMMM-----------------------JEANNIE ALLEN----------------------------
           Here's a simple recipe for
           A homemade clay that is
           Fun for kids, to use in
           Thanksgiving decorations
           Or almost anytime.
           This is the basic recipe-
           Specific directions
           Follow.
           ........................
      1 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Salt
    1/3 c  Water ( about )
 
    Here's how to do it....................
    1... In a large mixing bowl combine the flour and the salt.
  Graduakly add the water. Squeeze the dough with both hands until it
  is smooth. If the clay gets crumbly, wet your hands with a little
  water. If the clay gets too wet, sprinkle it with a little more flour
  and squeeze again.Store the clay in a plastic bag until you are ready
  to use it.
    2... Cover a cookie sheet with aluminum foil.  This will be your
  work surface. Do all your modeling and drying on the sheet.
  Directions for working with the clay will be given in each projcet
  description.
    3... Finished objects can be dried in the air, on more quickly in
  the oven. To air-dry your objects, place them on the foil covered

      Title: THANKSGIVING DAY TOFU
 Categories: Vegetarian, Holiday
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Tofu
      2 tb Arrowroot
      3 tb Vogue Vegy Base
    3/4 ts Sea salt
    1/4 ts White pepper
  1 1/2 ts Agar flakes; -=OR=-
      1 ts -Agar powder
      2 tb Barley malt syrup
      2 tb Water

MMMMM-----------------------SAGE DRESSING----------------------------
    1/2 c  Finely diced onions
    1/2 c  Finely diced celery
    1/2 c  Finely diced carrots
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
      2 tb Unrefined corn oil
    1/2 ts Ground sage
    1/4 ts Dried basil
      3 tb Vogue Vegy Base
      1 ts Sea salt
    1/8 ts Black pepper
      1 c  Water
      2 c  Cubed dry whole wheat bread
 
  This is a superb substitute for the traditional Thanksgiving turkey.
  It's also good for other times of the year! It's really the dressing
  that carries this dish. The corn oil gives it that wonderful buttery
  taste that poultry dressing usually has.
  
  Wash the tofu, pat it dry, and cut it into small pieces. Put the tofu,
  arrowroot, soup base, salt, pepper, and agar flakes in a food
  processor and blend to a smooth paste. Oil and flour the loaf pan (or
  line it with baking liner paper after oiling).  Spread a layer of
  tofu paste inside the pan, lining the bottom and all four sides.
  (Spread only a thin layer on the ends.)  Use all but about 1 cup of
  the paste.
  
  Firmly but gently press the dressing into the pan, on top of the tofu
  paste "liner".  Try to avoid displacing the tofu. Cover the dressing
  with the remaining tofu, carefully sealing the edges.  Cover the pan
  with foil, making certain the foil doesn't come in contact with the
  tofu. (The tofu will eat into the foil.)
  
  Bake in a preheated oven at 350 F for 30 to 40 minutes. Then remove
  the foil cover, glaze the top of the loaf with the dissolved barley
  malt syrup, turn the oven up to 450 F, and continue baking for 10
  minutes. Remove from oven and allow the loaf to cool for about 10
  minutes. Unmold, slice, and serve hot with a sauce of your choice.
  
  SAGE DRESSING:  Saute onions, celery, carrots, and garlic in oil for 5
  minutes.  Add the sage, basil, soup base, salt and pepper, and
  continue cooking 5 minutes longer.
  
  Add the water and bring to a simmer.  Stir in the bread crumbs and
  cook for a few minutes.  Then remove from heat.

  juice to make stiff.  Add water if the mixture seems too dry. Place
  in lightly oiled loaf pans. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 1 hour.
  
  Serve with favourite veggy ``gravy'' (optional.) After baking, cover
  with towel to keep moist, or if you like it dry, don't cover.
  
  Serve with Parsley "Gravy" Entered Separately

      Title: THANKSGIVING TILE
 Categories: Misc., Holidays, Kids
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           This could be a tile with
           A " Thanksgiving "drawing
           On it. Something the kids
           Can do freehand or looking
           At a picture in a coloring
           Book or magazine.
           These directions are for
           Using tracing paper and
           Copying a drawing of the
           Mayflower.
           ...................
 
    Here's how to do it................ 1... Follow the preceding
  directions on how to make the dough.
    With a rolling pin, roll out the clay until it's about 1/4 " thick.
    Place a 6" square of cardboard on top of the clay and cut around it
  with a butter knife. 2... Now draw the pattern for the Mayflower onto
  a piece of tracing paper. Place this pattern on the clay. Pressing
  hard with the point of a pencil, draw over the lines on the pattern.
  Lift the pattern off and then go over all the lines with the pencil.
  Make sure the lines are deep enough so the pattern will stand out
  after the tile is baked. 3... To hang your tile, make two holes at
  about 1/2 "" from the top. Later, after the tile has been baked and
  colored you can push a 12" piece of string through the holes and tie
  it to hang.

  chips, Hershey Bar and nuts.  Roll into balls and place two inches
  apart on a cookie sheet.  Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees.
  
  The following is a TRUE STORY:
  
  My daughter and I had just finished a salad at Neiman-Marcus Cafe in
  Dallas & decided to have a small dessert. Because both of us are such
  cookie lovers, we decided to try the "Neiman-Marcus Cookie". It was
  so excellent that I asked if they would give me the recipe and the
  waitress said with a small frown "I'm afraid not." "Well" I said,
  "would you let me buy the recipe?"   With a cute smile, she said
  "YES". I asked how much and she responded, " Only two fifty, it's a
  great deal!" I said with approval, "just add it to my tab".
  
     Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement from Neiman-Marcus
  and it was $285.00.  I looked again and remembered I had only spent
  $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00 for a scarf. As I glanced at
  the bottom of the statement, it said,  "Cookie Recipe - $250.00".
  That's outrageous!! I called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them
  that the waitress said it was "two - fifty," which clearly does not
  mean "two hundred and fifty dollars"  by any POSSIBLE interpretation
  of the phrase. Neiman-Marus refused to budge. They would not refund
  my money, because according to them,  " What the waitress told you is
  not our problem. You have already seen the recipe - we absolutely
  will not refund your money at this point." I explained to her the
  criminal statutes which govern fraud in Texas, I threatened to refer
  them to the Better Business Bureau and the State's Attorney General
  for engaging in fraud. I was basically told, " Do what you want, we
  don't give a crap, and we're not refunding your money." I waited a
  moment, thinking of how I could get even, or even try to get any of
  my money back. I just said "Okay, you folks got my $250, and now I'm
  going to have $250.00 worth of fun." I told her that I was going to
  see to it that every cookie lover in the United States with an e-mail
  account has a $250.00 cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus... for free.
  She replied, " I wish you wouldn't do this" I said, " Well you should
  have thought of that before you ripped me off, and slammed down the
  phone on her.
  
  So, here it is !!!  Please, please,  please pass it on to everyone
  you can possibly think of.  I paid $250 dollars for this... I don't
  want Neiman-Marcus to ever get another penny off of this recipe...

           USENET recipes
 
  INTRODUCTION 27 Jun 1986:  The new electronic interdependence
  recreates the world in the image of a global village. (Marshall
  McLuhan, 1967)
  
  INTRODUCTION:  This is a community cookbook, from an invisible
  worldwide electronic community.  Like all community cookbooks, it has
  the favorite recipes of the members of the community, suitably edited
  and organized. The USENET Cookbook is a collection of the favorite
  recipes of USENET readers worldwide.
  
  USENET:  USENET is the network by which Unix computer users talk to
  each other.  It is a worldwide net, made from computer-to-computer
  telephone links, linking some 60,000 people at 2,000 sites in 25
  countries. Besides serving an obvious technical and scientific
  purpose, USENET is also a medium for linking worldwide social groups
  of people who share common interests. The network group of people who
  like to cook is called net.cooks.  As an experiment in interactive
  electronic publication, the members of net.cooks decided to make a
  cookbook of recipes from their "global village". Brian Reid of DEC
  Western Research in Palo Alto, California, wrote the software and
  organized the online publication of the cookbook.
  
  The USENET Cookbook is a database and not just a book. The paper copy
  that you are holding was printed from a copy of the online database
  at some USENET site, but even as you are reading it, new recipes are
  being added to that database.
  
  The USENET Cookbook is an online database distributed with the
  intention that it be published as a book. The USENET Cookbook is
  distributed with software that enables every user to make his own
  customized edition of it, leaving out the recipes that he has no
  interest in, and perhaps adding a few of his own that he hasn't yet
  submitted to the network. There will be many different versions and
  editions of it, all with the same title, and all copyrighted. Every
  user can choose whether to print the recipes in imperial units (cups
  and spoons) or in metric units.

  knife or the plastic dough blade. With the machine running, pour in
  the hot water (make certain it's hot when you use it). As soon as
  it's in, turn the machine off; add the salt and remaining 2 cups of
  flour. Next, pulse until the dough begins to hold together; then let
  the machine run continously until a ball of dough forms.
  
  (ASSEMBLY: 5 MINUTES.) Lightly oil the pan with vegetable oil and

  into a 15-or-18-inch pizza shell. Fit the shell onto prepared pan.
  Sprinkle desired toppings over dough, and finish with a drizzling of
  olive oil. Bake 15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the
  topping is bubbly. For a well-done crust bake 5 minutes longer. Makes

      Title: THE ARK BARBEQUE SAUCE
 Categories: 
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 c  Tomato sauce
      3 c  Tomato ketchup
    1/2 c  Liquid smoke
      2 c  White vinegar
      1 tb Tabasco
      1 sm Onion -- diced fine
      3 tb Prepared mustard
      3 lg Cloves  garlic -- minced,
  1 1/2 c  Brown sugar
 
  Combine everything in a large pot and mix well. Bring mixture to
  rolling boil over high heat, stirring frequently from bottom to keep
  onions and garlic from settling to the bottom and scorching. When it
  boils, turn heat down and simmer 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Take from heat;
  cool at room temperature. Once cooled, cover and refrigerate. It will
  keep well for up to a month if covered properly refrigerated.
  
  Serve this sauce with oysters in the shell or with prawns in a
  casserole. Oysters, fresh  shucked and topped with this sauce and
  then with parmesan cheese, are wonderful.
  
  Another idea for serving: spread the sauce lightly on 6-8 oz salmon
  fillets in a baking dish and bake for about 12 minutes in a 425
  degree oven.
  
  Wonderful on sliced beef or chicken for quick lunch sandwiches.
  
  Cut French bread, spread the sauce on it, add Double Gloucester or
  Leicester cheese and toast/broil from the top.
  
  Or put poached egg on bread or English muffin, spread sauce over the
  egg, add grated cheddar cheese, top with jalapeno slices and
  toast/broil till the cheese melts. Serve with chilled fruit for a
  perfect breakfast.

      Title: THE BASIC BAGEL
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2 c  Warm water (100 to 115
           -deg.F)
      2 pk Active dry yeast
      3 tb Sugar
      3 ts Salt
           About 5 3/4 cup all-purpose
           -flour (unsifted)
      3 qt Water with 1 Tbl sugar
           Cornmeal
      1    Egg yolk beaten with 1 Tbl
           -water
 
  Combine water and yeast in the large bowl of an electric mixer; let
  stand 5 minutes. Stir in sugar and salt; gradually mix in 4 cup of
  the flour. Beat at medium speed for 5 minutes. With a spoon, mix in
  about 1 1/4 cups more flour to make a stiff dough. Turn out on a
  floured board and knead until smooth, elastic, and no longer sticky,
  about 15 minutes; add more flour as needed (dough should be firmer
  than for most other yeast breads). Place in a greased bowl, cover,
  and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled, about 40 minutes.
  Knead dough lightly, then divide into 12 equal pieces. To shape,
  knead each piece, forming it into a smooth ball. Holding ball with
  both hands, poke your thumbs through the center. With one thumb in
  the hole, work around perimeter, shaping bagel like a doughnut, 3 to
  3 1/2 inches across. Place shaped bagels on a lightly floured board,
  cover lightly, and let stand in a warm place for 20 minutes. Bring the
  water-sugar mixture to boiling in a 4 or 5 quart pan; adjust heat to
  keep it boiling gently. Lightly grease baking a baking sheet and
  sprinkle with cornmeal. Gently lift one bagel at a time and drop into
  water; boil about 4 at a time, turning often, for 5 minutes. Lift out
  with a slotted spatula, drain briefly on a towel, and place on the
  baking sheet. Brush bagels with the egg yolk glaze and bake in  a 400
  deg.F oven for about 35 to 40 minutes, or until well browned and
  crusty. Cool on a rack. Makes 12.
  
  WHOLE WHEAT BAGELS -----+-----+------ Follow basic recipe, omitting
  sugar; use 3 Tbl honey instead. In place of the flour, use 2 cups
  whole wheat, 1/2 cup wheat germ, and about 2 3/4 cups all-purpose
  flour. Mix in all the whole wheat flour and wheat germ and 1 1/4 cups
  all-purpose flour before beating dough. Then mix in about 1 1/2 cups
  more all-purpose flour, knead, and finish as directed.
  
  PUMPERNICKEL BAGELS *+* Follow basic recipe, omitting sugar; instead
  use 3 Tbl dark molasses. In place of the flour use 2 cups each rye
  and whole wheat and about 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour. Add all the
  rye and 1 cup each of the whole wheat and all-purpose before beating
  dough. Then add remaining 1 cup of whole wheat and about 3/4 cup more
  all-purpose flour, knead, and finish as directed.
  
  MORE BAGEL VARIETY ----+-----+------- Try adding 1/2 cup instant
  toasted onion to the whole wheat or basic bagels; add it to the yeast
  mixture along with the sugar and salt. Or sprinkle 1/2 tsp poppy or
  sesame seed or 1/4 tsp coarse salt on each glazed bagel before
  baking. Or add 1 Tbl caraway seed to pumpernickel bagels, then
  sprinkle each glazed bagel with 1/2 tsp more caraway seed before
  baking.

      Title: THE BELGIAN LION -- WHITE BEAN SOUP
 Categories: S, O, U, P
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
 
  The white bean soup, (like my mother use to make) that we served at
  the Husch winery dinner was well received and several people asked me
  if I would give the recipe. Here it is. But keep in mind that this is
  not an exact type of recipe. You should be guided by your own taste
  and imagination.
  
  For the beans: 1 pound Great Northern white beans 2 carrots 2
  branches of celery 1 onion Fresh thyme A few bay leaves Sea salt
  
  Place all ingredients in a pot and cover with plenty of water. Bring
  to a gentle simmer and cook until beans are done. Leave beans a bit
  underdone. Discard the vegetables and keep beans in cooking broth.
  
  For the soup:  1 to 2 quarts of good chicken or beef broth. Chicken
  or beef is a matter of taste and the amount you use will determine
  how thick the soup will be. If you serve the soup as one course of a
  several course dinner you probably want to keep the soup rather thin.
  On the other hand, this soup can be served as a main course and then
  could be served quite thick.
  
  2 or 3 carrots, chopped 2 or 3 celery stalks, chopped 1 or 2 leeks,
  chopped 1 red onion, chopped 4 or 5 garlic cloves, chopped A bunch of
  fresh spinach or red chard. (This is optional.)
  
  Place all the ingredients except spinach or chard in a heavy pan with
  some good olive oil. Sauté the vegetables without browning. Keep them
  firm.
  
  Strain the beans and add them to the other vegetables. Add the amount
  of stock you want and bring to a gentle simmer. Add salt and black
  pepper to taste. If you are using spinach (my preference) or chard,
  coarsely chop the leaves, discarding the stems and add to the soup.
  
  If you are serving the soup as a main course you may serve it
  accompanied by a good country bread and grated Parmesan or Swiss
  cheese.
  
  For the wine? A Marsanne, Semillo Viognier or even a light red like a
  Beaujolae or a young Cotes du Rhone.

      Title: THE BEST BANANA BREAD (OVO)
 Categories: Digest, Dec.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 lg Bananas (enough to mash 1
           Cup)
      1 c  Sugar
        x  Replacement for 1 egg (can
           Be 2 egg whites or one egg
           White and 1/3 c.
           Non-fat yogurt if you use
           Those things)
      4 tb Applesauce (baby applesauce
           Is best, but any other is
           Fine )
      1    And 1/2 cups flour (I use
    1/2    Whole wheat usually)
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Salt
 
  With a mixer, beat the mashed bananas with the sugar. Add the egg
  replacer and applesauce and beat again.
  
  In another bowl, mix the dry ingredients.  Add this to the banana
  mixture and stir with a spoon until the dry stuff is all moistened.
  Not too much stirring!
  
  Pour batter into a loaf pan.  (About 5 x 9 inches, preferrably
  non-stick or you can spray with Baker's Secret for a split second and
  spread with a paper towel.)
  
  Bake at 325 (be sure to preheat first) for about 55 minutes.
  
  This is great the second day and freezes great, too. If you have
  enough bananas make two and freeze one.

 Categories: Soups, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Black beans, picked over,
           -rinsed, and soaked for
     10    Hours or longer in water to
           -cover by at
           Least 4 inches
      6 c  Beef broth
      8 c  Water
      1 cn Tomatoes with their juice,
           -chopped (28 to 32
           Ounces)
      2 ts Cumin
           Salt to taste (Optional)
           Freshly ground black pepper
           -to taste
           JALAPENO CREAM:
    2/3 c  Plain nonfat or low-fat
           -yogurt
      1    Or 2 fresh jalapenos OR
           -pickled jalapenos, seeded
           -and
           Minced
      3 tb Minced fresh parsley
      1 tb Minced fresh cilantro
           -(Optional)
           GARNISHES (Optional):
    1/2 c  Chopped red onion
    1/2    Avocado, peeled, seeded, and
           -chopped
 
  SOUP:
  
  Drain the beans and put them in a large, heavy pot. Add the broth and
  water.  Bring the beans to a boil, stirring them a few times, reduce
  the heat, and simmer the beans in the uncovered pot for 1 hour.
  
  Stir in the tomatoes with their juice and the cumin, and continue
  simmering the beans for 2 hours or until the beans are soft (check
  after 1 and 1 1/2 hours, since the timing depends on the dryness or
  age of the beans.)
  
  Transfer the mixture to a large bowl, and let the mixture cool
  briefly. Rinse out the pot.  Then puree the mixture in batches in a
  blender or food processor until the mixture is smooth, returning the
  puree to the pot as you go.
  
  Season the soup with the salt (if desired) and pepper, and bring the
  soup to a simmer.  If the soup is too thin, simmer it in the
  uncovered pot, stirring it often, until the desired consistency is
  reached.
  
  To prepare jalapeno cream, whisk together the yogurt, jalapenos,
  parsley, and, if you are using it, cilantro. Serve a dollop of the
  jalapeno cream atop each bowl of soup. If you wish, you may also
  garnish the soup with the chopped red onion and/or chopped avocado.
  
  PREPARATION TIPS:  You can prepare the soup up to 4 days in advance
  and store it, covered, in the refrigerator. Or you can freeze it. The
  jalapeno cream can be prepared 1 or 2 days ahead.
  
  SERVING SUGGESTIONS:  In addition to the jalapeno cream, try
  garnishing the soup with chopped red onion and/or chopped avocado.
  With bread and salad, this soup could be the base for a light lunch.
  
  Makes 6 to 8 main or 8 to 10 first-course servings.

      Title: THE BEST BUTTERMILK WAFFLES
 Categories: Breads, Breakfast, Easy, Quick, Quick & eas
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  All-purpose flour
      1 tb Cornmeal, optional
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 lg Egg, separated
    7/8 c  Buttermilk
      2 tb Unsalted butter, melted
 
  Heat waffle iron. Whisk dry ingredients together in a medium bowl.
  Whisk yolk with buttermilk and butter. Beat egg white until it just
  holds a 2-inch peak. Add liquid ingredients to dry ingredients in a
  thin steady stream while gently mixing with a rubber spatula; be
  careful not to add liquid faster than you can incorporate it. Toward
  end of mixing, use a folding motion to incorporate ingredients;
  gently fold egg white into batter. Spread appropriate amount of
  batter onto waffle iron. Following manufacturer's instructions, cook
  waffle until golden brown, 2 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately. (You
  can keep waffles warm on a wire rack in a 200-degree oven for up to 5
  minutes.) Makes 3 to 4 waffles. (I rarely have buttermilk in the
  house, but I always have buttermilk *powder*. I substitute 1/4 cup
  buttermilk powder + 7/8 cup water for the buttermilk in this recipe.
  I add the buttermilk powder to the dry ingredients, and I add the
  water to the wet ingredients. The flavor is great! I do NOT use the
  cornmeal. Sometimes I add 1 tablespoon sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
  extract, but the sugar makes the waffles brown more quickly. I
  usually double or triple the recipe. If you don't have buttermilk or
  buttermilk powder, use the recipe for "Almost-as-Good-as-Buttermilk
  Waffles" instead. -jlw) NOTES
  : "The secret to great waffles is a thick batter, so don't expect to
  pour this one. Make toaster waffles out of leftover batter --
  undercook the waffles a bit, cool them on a wire rack, wrap them in
  plastic wrap and freeze. Pop them in the toaster for a quick
  breakfast." -- Christopher Kimball, Cook's Illustrated magazine. By

      Title: THE BEST CHICKEN-FRIED STEAK SOUTH OF OMAHA
 Categories: Meats, Texas cooki
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    6 ounce round steak cutlet
           Machine tenderized
           Flour
      4    Eggs
      1 cn Flat beer
      1 tb Adolph's meat tenderizer
           Salt, pepper, and garlic
           Salt -- to taste
 
  Bill Maxwell, former Texas restaurateur, originally claimed his
  chicken-fried steak was the "best found south of the Rio Brazos."
  Subsequent chicken-fried steak contests proved him truthful, so he
  extended his claim to include all lands south of the Arkansas River.
  In another conversation with Bill, we found his "boundary" had crept
  north to Omaha, Nebraska. Well, eventually he's gonna have to stop at
  the North Pole ... we hope.
  
  Sprinkle salt, pepper and garlic salt on both sides of tenderized
  steak to taste. Put steak onto a tray that is well-covered with
  flour. Then "pound the hell out of it (the steak) with stiff fingers,
  working from the center out, until it reaches the size of an L.P.
  record." (That's those things they used to make before compact
  discs). Flip several times and repeat pounding. Mix eggs, beer, 1
  teaspoon salt and Adolph's meat tenderizer in a shallow bowl. Add
  enough flour to make a thin, watery batter. Beat mixture smooth. Dip
  meat into batter. "Flop" back onto flour tray and cover with four.
  Pound again with fingertips until moisture is absorbed. Cook in deep
  fat at 350 degrees until golden brown. Serve with French fries and
  cover with white gravy.

  completely.
  
  4. Frost with your favorite chocolate frosting.  (Use vegan margarine
  and a bit of soy milk instead of butter and milk. )

  A Wok That Can Rust Is a Wok Worth Cleaning by Joyce Jue
  
  Recently, a reader wrote asking if he should throw out his rusty wok
  and start with a new one.  Keep it!  An old wok that can rust is a
  wok worth owning.
  
  Unless the cooking surface has deep pits from rust, a wok can be
  cleaned and reseasoned.  It should stir-fry better than when it was
  new.
  
  Wok Talk:
  
  Why an I writing about woks again?  Because the "rusty wok" question
  is the one I'm most frequently asked, followed by: How do you season
  a----wok??
  
  If you want to feel like a Chinese cook and produce dishes that taste
  authentically Chinese, I highly recommend using a carbon spun-steel
  or thin iron wok for stir-frying. Both require initial seasoning, but
  regular use will maintain the seasoning and eventually produce a
  shiny black patina finish.
  
  Chinese cooks are persnickety about their woks.  It takes time, care
  and lots of cooking before a wok develops a patina that almost
  impervious black coating found on well-used woks. The ultimate goal
  is for the wok to impart wok hay, an elusive pan flavor and aroma
  that is associated with Chinese restaurant dishes.
  
  Actually, wok hay comes from cooking over extremely high heat in a
  well-seasoned pan.
  
  Finely Tuned Implement:
  
  Once a wok imparts wok hay, it is respected like a finely-tuned
  instrument.
  
  A well-seasoned wok is almost non-stick.  I often stir-fry vegetables
  using just a thin film of surface oil.
  
  As the patina builds up, less cooking oil is required.
  
  A wok is quite sturdy.  It stands up to high heat better than any
  other cooking pan.  It seems impervious to being banged or battered -
  I have accidentally dropped mine down four flights of concrete stairs
  and it came through intact with patina unscratched.
  
  A wok's worst enemies are soap and scouring pads - they'll remove any
  seasoning the wok has acquired.
  
  Until a wok takes on a shiny, smooth, black patina, the initial
  seasoning must be strengthened by frequent use of the pan, and
  fortified by an occasional light re-seasoning.
  
  There is no shortcut to achieving a perfectly seasoned wok. It comes
  from use.
  
  Seasoning: To season a new carbon spun-steel wok or to re-season an
  old rusty wok, thoroughly scrub it inside and out with soap and a
  steel wool scouring pad to remove the manufacturer's protective
  coating on a new wok, or the rust on an old one.  Rinse thoroughly
  with hot water. Some manufacturers apply a coating that is hard to
  remove, so set the wok on the stove, fill it with water and boil it
  for several minutes until the coating dissolves.  Pour out the water
  and scrub the surface clean with steel wool and soap.
  
  Set the clean wok over high heat.  Heat until a few drops of water
  sprinkled into the wok immediately turn into dancing beads. While the
  pan is heating, it will change from shiny steel gray to blue, purple,
  red and, finally, black.
  
  Dip several sheets of wadded-up paper towel into peanut or corn oil
  and wipe the oil on the entire inside surface of the wok (you may
  want to use long-handled tongs to hold the towels).  Reduce heat to
  low and let the wok sit over the heat for 15 minutes to absorb the
  oil - the color changes will continue and, hopefully, the bottom of
  the wok will darken. In time and with frequent use the entire wok
  will turn black. if the surface looks dry, wipe with another thin
  film of oil. Remove wok from the burner and let it cool.
  
  Reheat the wok and repeat the oiling and heating process once more
  before using it for stir-frying.

           For Decoration-----
      7 oz Semisweet Chocolate --
           Melted
      6    To 8
           Lemon, Orange O
      1 tb Cocoa Powder -- in a fine
           Sieve
           Raspberry Sauce-----
  1 1/2 c  Fresh Raspberries
    1/2 c  Sugar -- or more
      2 tb Fresh Lemon Juice
           Fresh Green Leaves Such As
 
  Preparing the Genoise Sponge Cake:  Preliminaries. Using the pastry
  brush, butter an 8-inch (4 cup) stainless steel bowl (one you can
  bake in) quite generously and coat with flour (knock out the excess).
  
  Preheat oven to 350 F.  Cake batter:  Beat eggs and sugar in bowl of
  mixer for 5 minutes until thick, fluffy and tripled in volume.
  Rapidly sift and fold in flour with big rubber spatula and scoop
  batter into prepared bowl. bake in middle level of preheated oven for
  35 to 45 minutes until toothpick stuck in middle comes out clean.
  Turn out onto rack to cool completely (1 hour) before proceeding.
  
  Melt the chocolate: Bring 2 inches of water to simmer and set bowl
  over it, add 5 oz of chocolate and remove from heat. When completely
  melted, remove bowl from water and let cool to room temp.
  
  Whip cream into soft peaks and set bowl over ice water. Fold half the
  cream into cooled (but liquid) chocolate; when incorporated, fold in
  the rest to complete the mousse.
  
  Assembling the cake:  (Taste the OJ to be sure it's sweet enough and
  add Grand Marnier if desired.  Shave off crusty top of cake (it won't
  absorb the OJ) Use a serrated knife to slice the Genoise into 3
  layers of equal thickness.  Line 8 inch bowl with plastic wrap. Fit
  round top piece of cake into bowl, brush with about 4 tab of OJ.
  Spoon 1/3 of the mousse onto soaked layer and strew on a handful of
  raspberries. Place the next layer ontop of the mousse, brush with 1/3
  cup of OJ and spoon on rest of mousse, a handful of raspberries and
  put on the last layer of cake. Brusk on the last of the juice. Bring
  the hanging edges of plastic over the top, cover with another piece
  of plastic and refrigerate for several hours before decorating.
  Making chocolate icing: Melt remaining chocolate in a bowl over
  simmering water (same as mousse)  Remove plastic covering from cake
  and unmold domed-side up onto a rack, then peel off and discard
  plastic. Lightly dampen your work surface so a 12 inch sheet of
  plastic wrap will adhere.  Using rubber spatula, spread a thin 10-11
  inch disk of cool liquid chocolate in the center of the sheet.
  Rapidly slide plastic ito the bowl, so chocolate disc covers bottom
  and sides of bowl. gently drop the chilled cake, domed side down,
  into bowl, fold plastic wrap over it and refrigerate.
  
  Makeing chocolate leaves: Dip the inside of each leaf into remaining
  melted chocolate and place on a plate, coated side up. Refrigerate
  until chocolate hardens.
  
  Decorating cake:  Remove cake from fridge and fold back wrap. Turn
  domed-side up onto serving cake and lift off plastic wrap. Sprinkle
  with dusting of powder. Make a ring of raspberries around edge of
  cake and pour a little raspeberry sauce over them. Affix chocolate
  leaves to cake (with melted chocolate, after you've removed the green
  part).
  
  Raspberry sauce: Puree raspberries with 1/2 cup sugar in a blender or
  food processor.  Add lemon juice, taste, adjust the flavor if
  necessary. Push the sauce through a sieve.
  
  To cut the cake, keep a knife in hot water nearby, wipe it off before
  cutting. Source: Cooking With Master Chefs by Julia Child]

    1/4 ts Curry powder
    1/2 ts Black pepper,
           -freshly ground
    1/4 ts Salt (or to taste)
 
  In a large frying pan, melt the butter.  Saute mushrooms in butter
  until tender (about 5 minutes). Mix flour and chicken base together.
  Sprinkle over mushrooms. Cook one more minute, stirring. Add sour
  cream, lemon juice and all seasonings. Cook 2 to 3 minutes more,
  stirring.
  
  We use chicken broth or chicken bouillon.  If you use a vegetable
  broth this is a vegetarian dish.
  
  If you can resist digging in right away, cook this ahead of time to
  give the flavors a chance to mellow. At serving time, rewarm
  carefully over low heat. This is wonderful as a main dish served over
  rice, noodles or fettucini Alfredo.

      Title: THE CULINARY MUSTARDS
 Categories: Info, Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  YELLOW OR WHITE MUSTARD: (Sinapis alba).  'Sinapis' is the Greek name
  for mustard and the word from which the German word for mustard,
  'senf', is derived.  (The species may also be offered as 'Brassica
  alba' or 'B. hirta')  This is the species whose seed is most commonly
  used in American prepared mustards.  (The brassy yellow color or many
  prepared mustards comes from the addition of turmeric or other food
  coloring.) Although some yellow mustard seed is used in English
  mustards, it is forbidden in the classic Dijon mustards. The seeds,
  which are a warm beige and somewhat larger than those of black and
  brown mustards, are sometimes sprouted for use in salads. Plants
  usually grow 1 to 2 feet tall.
  
  BLACK MUSTARD: (Brassica nigra).  The seeds of black mustard are dark
  brown and about 1/16 inch in diameter. The black mustard plant can
  grow as tall as 10 feet, but 5 or 6 feet is more usual. This is the
  most pungent of the mustards and a prolific seed producer, but its
  height and the instability of its pods make it difficult to harvest
  with machinery. Thus, it is not widely cultivated commercially and is
  available mostly through specialty stores.
  
  BROWN MUSTARD: (B. juncea).  Brown mustard seeds are similar in size
  and color to those of black mustard, but significantly less pungent.
  The plant is only about half as tall as black mustard (about 4 feet)
  and much more easily cultivated, and it has largely replaced black
  mustard as a cultivated crop.  Some 250,000 acres of prairie in
  Canada are planted to brown and yellow mustard.  Numerous cultivars
  of this species have been bred for their lively, nutritious greens,
  which are especially highly regarded in Asia, but these are not the
  cultivars used for seed production.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Sheep's stomach
      1    Sheep heart
      1    Sheep liver
    1/2 lb Fresh suet (kidney leaf fat
           -is preferred)
    3/4 c  Oatmeal
      3    Onions, finely chopped
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
    1/4 ts Cayenne
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
    3/4 c  Stock
 
  Wash stomach well, rub with salt and rinse. Remove membranes and
  excess fat. Soak in cold salted water for several hours. Turn stomach
  inside out for stuffing.
  
  Cover heart and liver with cold water, Bring to a boil, reduce heat,
  cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Chop heart and coarsely grate liver.
  Toast oatmeal in a skillet on top of the stove, stirring frequently,
  until golden. Combine all ingredients and mix well. Loosely pack
  mixture into stomach, about two-thirds full. Remember, oatmeal
  expands in cooking.
  
  Press any air out of stomach and truss securely. Put into boiling
  water to cover. Simmer for 3 hours, uncovered, adding more water as
  needed to maintain water level. Prick stomach several times with a
  sharp needle when it begins to swell; this keeps the bag from
  bursting. Place on a hot platter, removing trussing strings. Serve
  with a spoon. Ceremoniously served with "neeps and nips"--mashed
  turnips, nips of whiskey and mashed potatoes.

      Title: THE DREADED RED MENACE
 Categories: Sauces, Spices
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3    Dried Habanero Chilies
      1 tb Grated Orange Zest
      1 c  Raspberry Vinegar
  1 1/2 c  Unsweetened Raspberries
           -Fresh Or Frozen
    1/3 c  Fresh Orange Juice
 
  First let me say that this is not my recipe. It was created by Jim
  Tarantino as a method of adding some red color to another of his
  unusual and exciting sauces, Yellow Hell Marinade, which is used in a
  dish he created called "Mango Shrimp from Hell." I made the Dreaded
  Red Menace some evenings ago and absolutely fell in love with it. I
  think it's a masterpiece of creativity and simplicity. My dinner
  companion, a young lady relatively inexperienced in the ways of
  cooking and spicy foods, felt that the Dreaded Red Menace was a
  little much. You be the judge, but definitely try it!  There's a
  variation on this sauce called the "Smoky Red Menace" and it uses 3 -
  4  dried chipotles instead of the habaneros. Here's what Jim
  Tarantino says about this sauce:
  
  "For Philadelphia's Book and the Cook event, I wanted to streak some
  red sauce paint through pools of Yellow Hell marinade for a dish
  called Mango Shrimp from Hell. Well, the red sauce never made it to
  the shrimp ~ it tasted so good that we marinated chicken breasts with
  it instead. People are initially fooled by the sweet raspberry
  flavor, but this marinade packs a fair amount of heat. We started
  referring to the marinade in the restaurant as the "Dreaded Red
  Menace." It's wonderful as a dipping sauce too."
  
  One of the reasons I made this sauce when I did was because, in the
  directions for the recipe, Tarantino mentions that one should use the
  plastic, or dough, blade in the Cuisinart when pureeing the
  raspberries. I wanted to see just how true his comment was, since
  there was some discussion of the issue on CIS. I pureed the berries
  in two batches, one with the steel blade and the other with the
  plastic blade. Jim Tarantino clearly speaks from experience. Use the
  plastic blade for raspberries and other similar berries.
  
  Combine the chiles, orange zest, and vinegar in a heavy nonreactive
  pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the vinegar to 1/3 cup, strain, and
  discard the solids. Return the vinegar to the saucepan. Puree the
  raspberries in a food processor fitted with a plastic dough blade. (A
  steel blade will crush the seeds, which will lend a bitter taste to
  the food.) Then strain. Add the raspberry puree to the vinegar and
  simmer over low heat for 20 minutes. Cool to room temperature and add
  the orange juice. The marinade will keep in the refrigerator in an
  airtight jar for 1 to 2 weeks.
  
  Yield: 1 1/2 cups
  
  Marinate shrimp for 2 to 3 hours; chicken breasts 4 to
        6    hours.

      1 lb Dried fruit (i.e. apricots)
      1 ea Water to cover
 
  This may be obvious to everyone else, but I've just discovered how to
  make lovely "fruit butter."  get a pound of dried fruit (I used
  apricots). put in a heavy saucepan with enough water to cover. simmer
  for two hours. if there is a lot of liquid left, but the fruit is
  plump and tender and breaking up, turn up the heat and evaporate the
  water away until there's just a tad, like maybe 1/2 cup. pour this
  into a blender and puree for about a minute. comes out just a bit
  stiffer than baby food. really really rich and tasty, sweet and tart.
  perfect for my cream of wheat in the morning. and toast.

      2 tb Canola oil
      4 tb Patis (fish sauce)*
           -approximately
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
 
  In a LARGE pot lightly saute the garlic in the oil until lightly
  brown. Add ginger and onions, cook till onions turn translucent. Add
  chicken pieces, mix well. Add patis and black pepper to mixture. Add
  at LEAST 10 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce
  heat, cook until the chicken is tender, about 45 minutes. When
  chicken is done, add the chayote squash and the chiles, then return
  to a boil and cook over a medium heat for about 10-15 minutes until
  the squash is tender. Then, add the spinach on top of the soup, cover
  and cook until spinach wilts, about 1-2 minutes. Serve with brown
  rice, and the traditional Filipino way is to take one of the cooked
  chiles out and put it in a small bowl with enough patis to cover,
  then smash the chile up in the sauce. You then use the chile/patis
  mixture to season, if it's not salty enough. * This is easiest found
  in an oriental grocery. The best brand is Rufina,  if you can't get
  that, Tiparos (from Thailand) is OK. Submitted By RICHARD EIKENBURG

  Grate the potatoes onto a large clean kitchen towel that can be
  stained. Roll the potatoes up in the towel and wring to remove
  moisture. (It is best to do this over the sink, since it will produce
  a suprising amount of liquid). Melt the butter with the olive oil on
  a large griddle. Form the grated potatoes into 4 pancakes. Cook the
  pancakes over medium heat for about 10 minutes, until bottom is
  golden brown, then flip the pancakes. Cook on the other side for
  about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and serve plain or with
  sour cream and applesauce.

      Title: THE FIVE MINUTE KILLER FUDGE
 Categories: Candies, Chocolate
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
    2/3 c  Evaporated Milk
  1 2/3 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Miniature Marshmallows
  1 1/2 c  Semi-sweet Chocolate Chips
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Nuts
 
  Read all of the instructions before starting.  Wise advice would be
  to have the ingredients in the 3rd paragraph ready to go, and also
  the pan already buttered.  Do all of this BEFORE you begin to cook.
  
  Combine Milk, Sugar, and Salt in saucepan over medium heat Bring to a
  boil and cook 4-5 minutes, stirring constantly (start timing when the
  mixture starts to "bubble" around the corners of the pan). Remove
  from heat. Add Marshmallows, Chocolate Chips, Nuts and Vanilla. Stir
  vigorously for 1 minute (or until Marshmallows are completely melted
  and blended).
  
  Pour into a buttered 8" square pan.  Cool until it doesn't fall out or
  slosh around in pan.  Eat!
  
  For the totally inept in the kitchen (or kids):
  
  Don't leave out ingredients...So what if you can't find the vanilla.
  If you leave it out, the fudge will taste about the same, but it will
  be hard enough to use as asphalt patch. You'll ruin the pan using a
  chisel to get the fudge out...Don't overcook!...Mix well! You should
  end up with a uniform texture about the same appearance as Hershey's
  Syrup... It has to cool before it turns solid...Buttering the pan
  means putting just a little butter or margarine on a clean piece of
  paper toweling and rubbing the bottom of the pan with it. Pretend
  your waxing the car.

      Title: THE FRAGRANCE OF PORK (TUNGPO PORK)
 Categories: Chinese, Pork, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/4 lb Belly pork in one piece
      2    Level tablespoons salt
      2 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Wine
      2    Spring onions (scallions)
      2 sl Ginger
 
  The following passage is from "Chinese Gastronomy", one of the best
  books on Chinese cuisine I've ever seen. It beautifully expresses the
  nearly metaphysical regard that the Chinese have for food and eating
  and is delightful reading even if you never cook a single recipe from
  it. This dish is incredibly good, considering that its main
  ingredients are pork fat and skin.  The fat is not something to be
  gotten rid of in this case. It's treasured for what it is. Like I
  said, this is something that I don't cook often but it's a special
  occasion when I do.
  
  This is one of my all time favorites.  I serve it with a bowl of
  Chinese mustard and a bowl of chopped green onions for dipping.
  
  At one time the butcher shops of Soochow were variously called Genuine
  Straw Mat, Original Straw Mat, Old Straw Mat, etc., just because
  there is a story about an Immortal in disguise who flung a bit of mat
  into a pot of belly pork to give it a special fragrance. The
  fragrance is easy enough to produce. What is important is that it
  stands out in a clear field. Instead of being heavy, the pork should
  appear light; clean instead of messy; smooth instead of lumpy. The
  flavour of pork is effusive. While the cooking of chicken and beef
  means the careful carving out of its best flavour from the raw
  material, the flavours of pork must be restrained. At its best, pork
  is tender, sweet, fragrant, tasty, rich without being oily (in other
  words, nun, hsien, hsiang, nung, yu-er-pu-ni).
  
  A geometrically precise square of belly pork is stewed and then
  steamed in a little sauce, so that it is served with an absolutely
  clear layer of melted fat overlying a smooth brown sauce. The surface
  is a rich brown colour, the fat smooth and custard-like, the meat
  brown and tender. The square of fat was named after Su Tungpo, the
  poet, for unknown reasons. Perhaps it is just because he would have
  like it.  The square of fat is regarded with much passion, tenderness
  and expectation.
  
  Second-rate versions of it appear everywhere, differing from the
  following version by their failure to clear the field for the
  delicacy of the pork fat which, if prepared accordingly, tastes fresh
  and clean like fresh (sweet) butter.  In order to keep the flavour
  clear, the meat is first salted to remove the bloody juices, blanched
  to remove the scum, then stewed very slowly, and finally steamed for
  hours to tenderize the fat slowly.  Inferior versions this are made
  by stewing pork for a few hours without steaming it... The result is
  lumpy fat. If the salt rub and blanching are omitted the juice
  becomes messy and lumpy. The simplicity of appearance, smoothness and
  clarity of flavour have to be wrested from the manifold flavours of
  pork.
  
  Tungpo Pork is customarily served at the end of a meal with bowls of
  rice. People sigh, shout and groan with happiness when they see it.
  
  This is one of the pinnacles of gastronomy, and sums up the
  application of fat in Chinese cuisine.
  
  Trim pork into a precise square.  Wash it and wipe it dry with a
  towel. Rub it with salt and let it stand for about 2 hours. Discard
  the blood-tinged liquid.
  
  Bring 5 pints (12 cups) water to a boil and blanch the meat in it.
  Rinse it free of scum and repeat the blanching with a fresh portion
  of boiling water. Place the pork skin side up in a pot with a
  tight-fitting lid, adding soy sauce, wine, spring onions ginger and 2
  tablespoons water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to very
  low and simmer for 2 hours, adding a little more water if necessary.
  Keep the amount of liquid as small as possible, and do not keep
  uncovering the pot to see how the pork is progressing.  Let it stew
  in its own juices.
  
  Discard the spring onions and ginger.  Place the square skin side
  down on a dish of soup plate dimensions, add the juices and cover it
  very closely with foil, cellophane or an overlapping plate.  Steam it
  for 4 hours, until the fat is tender and can be cut with a spoon.
  Invert the square so that the fat is uppermost, and pour the juices
  around it carefully.

  2 1/2 tb Flour
      1 c  Reserved gluten stock
           -from "turkey" recipe
      1 tb White wine
           Several dashes soy sauce
      1 tb Light Yeast Flovoring
           -see recipe, optional
 
  The yuba must be soaked and reconstituted to a soft, pliable texture
  before using.  It is best to put individual sheets between wet towels
  until they turn soft and white in color. They are then ready to use.
  Using either wheat flour or vital wheat gluten flour, make gluten
  according to the recipe.  Roll it out into a rectangle approximately
  15 inches long and 8 to 10 inches wide. Sprinkle with 1/3 cup yeast
  flavoring (unless you've added it in with your vital wheat gluten).
  Roll it up lengthwise. Spread out the cheesecloth and place the
  glutten roll in the middle. Wrap the sides of the cloth around the
  glutten roll first, then tie the ends together. It should be wrapped
  fairly loosely so that the gluten can expand a little while cooking
  but not so loose that it expands too much and becomes too soft and
  spongy in texture. Place the roll in a large pot. Pour over it the
  gallon of water and the remaining 2/3 cup yeast flavoring. Cover
  bring to a boil, turn down the heat and simmer for 1 1/2 hours. This
  process can be done up to two days before serving. Prepare the
  stuffing of your choice. Remove the gluten roll from the stock,
  saving the stock for gravy. Untie and remove the cheesecloth. Unroll
  the "turkey" and fill it with the stuffing, or mound the stuffing on
  a large greased baking sheet and place the gluten around it.  Place
  the stuffed gluten on a large greased baking sheet. Reconstitute the
  yuba as mentioned before, by soaking for 5 minutes in water in a
  flat, shallow dish or between layors of wet towels. It will turn
  white and be pliable but will still be fragile. Cover the "turkey"
  with two to three layers of yuba. Melt the margarine and brush the
  entire "turkey" with some of it.  Pour the wine into the remaining
  margarine: this will be used for basting while baking. If desired, 2
  tablespoons of the yeast flavoring can be added to the margarine-wine
  mixture to give it an even more authentic flavor.

 Categories: Vegetarian

  continued from part one
  
  Place the "turkey" in a preheated 350 degree oven and bake for 1 1/4
  to 1 1/2 hours, basting every 15 minutes with the wine-margarine
  mixture and the juces in the pan. If it brown too much, cover loosly
  with aluminum foil. Carv as you would with a regular roast and
  accompany with stuffing. LIGHT YEAST FLAVORING POWDER: Pulverize all
  ingredients in a blender until powdered.  Store in a jar in a cool
  place. GREAT GLUTEN DRESSING: Melt the margarine.  Saute the onion,
  celery, and mushrooms. Combine with the remaining ingredients,
  moistening with stock as necessary. GRAVET FOR MOCK TURKEY: Melt the
  margarine in aq saucepan. Add the flour and cook for two minutes. Add
  the reserved gluten stock, white wine and soy sauce. Cook, stirring
  constantly until thick.  For more flavor, an additional tablespoon of
  light yeast flavoring may be added. HOMEMADE GLUTTEN: when you wash
  the starch and bran away from high-gluten, whole-wheat flour, you end
  up with just the wheat protien, or gluten. It's a strechy substance
  with a particularly meaty texture when baked, boiled, stewed and
  fried, and is the main component of the Great Gluten Turkey. This
  recipe uses 3 puonds of flour. Note that the "turkey" recipe uses 10
  pounds of flour. The recipe ingredients can be increased and you can
  follow the same method outlined here. NOTE: If you wish to avoid the
  work of making homemade gluten, there is also instant gluten flour
  (vital wheat gluten), which only needs to be mixed with water. 3
  pounds or more high-gluten whole-wheat flour 3 cups or more water The
  important point here is to use a high-gluten whole-wheat flour.
  Whole-wheat pastry flour will not give you the same results. If
  you're in in doubt, ask for the best flour for breadbaking, it has
  the highest gluten content. Place the flour in a large bowl and add
  the water while stirring constantly. Add enough water to make a very
  firm dough, it should be much firmer than bread dough. Allow this to
  sit for at least one hour.  No kneading or setting overnight is
  necessary. Place the bowl containing the dough in the sink.  Fill it
  with tap water and begint to massage the dough.  The water will grow
  very white and milky ar first, as the starch rinses out. This liquid
  can be saved and used in place of arrowroot or cornstarch to thicken
  sauces and such. It will keep for about two weeks in the
  refrigerator. If you don't save it, discard the water as it gets
  cloudy and fill the bowl with fresh water. Keep filling the bowl with
  fresh water, massaging the dough and discarding the water for about
  10 - 15 minutes until the water grows gradually clear. During this
  process as the starch and bran gets washed away, the dough will
  shrink in size and at one point may appear to be falling apart
  completely. In the end it will all congeal into one strechy mass.
  When it looks like you have a giant wad of well chewed bubble gum,
  you have transformed flour into raw gluten. It is now ready for use
  in the Great Gluten Turkey Recipe.

  stick together. Pour into large coated baking dish. Dot evenly with
  butter.
  
  Bake at 325 degrees for approximately 45 minutes until puffed and

      Title: THE JOY OF BROWNIES
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 oz Unsweetened chocolate
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine
      4    Eggs
      2 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
      1 c  Broken pecans or walnuts
 
   Serve with vanilla or chocolate chip ice cream. If you really want to
  indulge, add chocolate syrup or sauce to the ice cream and brownies.
  
   Melt chocolate and butter over very low heat. Stir frequently.
  Remove from heat and cool.
  
   Preheat oven to 325ø.
  
   In a medium size bowl, beat eggs until light. Continue beating, and
  gradually add sugar and salt until light and fluffy. Stir in vanilla
  and chocolate-butter mixture. Stir in the flour, then nut meats.
  
   Baking options: For 9 giant brownies, bake in 9 x 9-inch pan; for 12
  large brownies or 24 small ones, bake in 9 x 13-inch pan. Prepare
  pans by greasing and flouring. Bake 45-60 minutes depending on how
  fudgy or cake-like you prefer them). Don't bake beyond the point that
  a toothpick comes out a bit wet.
  
   These can be served out of the pan. Allow to cool completely before
  cutting. To remove from pan, cool 15 minutes after removing from
  oven, then loosen edges and turn over as you would remove a cake. Set
  top up to cool completely.
  
  Yield: 9 giant, 12 large or 24 small brownies. Martina Boudreau, St.

 Categories: Spreads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 pt Lowfat (1-2% milkfat)
           -cottage cheese
    1/4 c  Water
      4 tb Nonfat dry milk
      2 pk ButterBuds natural butter
           -flavored mix
      1    -3 packages Sweet 'n Low
 
  It's easy. Just pour all of above into your blender. Blend on low and
  increase speed until smooth. Then pour/scrape mixture back into cheese
  container and refrigerate.
  
  You'll never taste the cottage cheese. I use 2 packs of Sweet 'n Low.
  Experiment until you love the taste. With just 7 calories per
  tablespoon and an almost unmeasurable trace of artery clogging fat
  and cholesterol, you'll never want to use cholesterol laden 100
  calorie butter or 100 calorie margarine on your bread again.

    1/2 ts Paprika
    1/4 ts Tabasco sauce
           Juice of one lemon

           Salt to taste
           Clarified butter
           Lemon wedges

MMMMM-------------------ANCHO CHILI REMOULADE------------------------
      1    Ancho chilies (to 2 chilies)
           -ripened, dried poblano
           -chilies are sometimes
           -labeled pasilla
      2 lg Egg yolks
    1/4 ts Dried mustard
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Olive oil (to 2/3 cup)
      2 tb Lemon juice
      1 tb Tarragon vinegar
      2 tb Small capers, rinsed and
           -finely chopped
    1/4 c  Celery, finely chopped
    1/4 c  Yellow onion, finely chopped
    1/4 c  Cornichons, finely chopped
      1 tb Parsley, finely chopped
      1 cl Garlic, minced
 
  Crab Cakes:  Soak the breadcrumbs in the olive oil and half and half.
  In a small bowl combine the mustard, paprika, Tabasco, lemon juice,
  and pepper and mix thoroughly.  In a large bowl, combine the
  crabmeat, egg
  
  yolks, horseradish, cream sauce, soaked breadcrumbs, salt and mustard
  mixture and mix well.  Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary. In a
  small, dry, clean bowl, whip the egg whites to soft peaks.  Fold them
  into the crab mixtures.  Form the crab mixture into twelve small
  cakes. Heat a teflon skillet or griddle to 350 degrees with just
  enough clarified butter to film the bottom.  Fry the crab cakes until
  they are golden brown on each side and heated through, approximately
  3 minutes per side. Service with Ancho Chili Remoulade and garnish
  with a lemon wedge.
  
  Ancho Chili Remoulade:  Remove and discard stems and seeds from the
  chilies.  Place them in a bowl and add enough water to cover.  Weight
  them with a plate so they are completely submerged and let them soak
  overnight, or for at least 6 to 8 hours.  Or, place seeded chilies in
  boiling water, cover and simmer for 5 minutes.  Turn off heat and let
  steep 20 minutes or until soft. In a blender or food rocessor, puree
  the chilies until smooth. Add the egg yolks, dry mustard and salt and
  blend until smooth.  Add oil in a steady stream, very slowly at
  first.  Continue adding the oil until desired thickness is reached.
  Blend in the lemon juice and tarragon vinegar.  Place mixture in a
  bowl and fold in remaining ingredients. Refrigerate several hours
  before serving.

  you to make and enjoy all summer long as a topping for burgers,
  sandwiches and cold meats. This relish is so yummy and easy to make,
  you'll want to keep some on hand all year long.
  
  1. Place zucchini, onions and salt in a large bowl; mix well and
  cover. Refrigerate overnight. The next day, place mixture in a fine
  strainer. Drain well, rinse under cold water and drain again for 1
  hour.
  
  2. Place mixture in a heavy pot and remaining ingredients. Bring to a
  boil and simmer, stirring occasionally, 30 minutes.
  
  3. Cool completely and store, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 4
  weeks. Or sterilize 3 or 4 pint-sized canning jars in boiling water.
  Fill with relish, seal and process in boiling water for 10 minutes.
  Carefully remove jars with tongs. Let rest until relish comes to room
  temperature. Store in cool, dark place for up to 6 months.

      Title: THE MAVIN'S WAY TO PICKLE BEEF OR TONGUE
 Categories: Meats, Corned, Preserves
      Yield: 3 Lbs
 
      3 lb Beef Brisket or Beef Tongue
      1 qt Cold Water
      2 ts Pickling spices; minus the
           -red pepper. or with them
      5    Garlic Cloves; chopped
      4    Bay Leaves
      3 tb Salt
      1 ts Saltpeter; seenote
           -or
      1 ts Ascorbic Acid
 
   Seenote; saltpeter, controversy about the use of this item makes me
  add a substitute.
   From a well known source I quote; " Use Pure crystalline ascorbic
  acid (Vitamin C) instead of saltpeter because pure ascorbic acid
  can't do you an iota of harm. Use at the rate of 0.05 percent of the
  weight of meat, which works out to 1 gram of crystalline ascorbic
  acid for every 4.5 pounds; or rounding it off, to 1/4 teaspoon for 5
  pounds, 1/2 teaspoon for 10 pounds, and so on. Add the ascorbic acid
  to either the dry cure or the Brine." This from "Putting Food By" a
  resource for storing and preservation by the team of Hertzberg,
  Vaughn, and Greene.
   Buy the brisket well marbled with fat. This is cheaper cut, usually,
  but turns out to be more suitable for this recipe. Use the exact
  recommended weight of meat because the other ingredients are
  calibrated for this. Be especially careful when measuring saltpeter;
  use exactly the amount listed. Place the meat in a deep glass bowl or
  a stoneware crock. Pour the quart of water into another glass bowl.
  Add the remaining ingredients, mix together, and pour over the meat;
  add enough water to cover. Tightly cover and refrigerate. It is best
  to keep this in the coldest part of the refrigerator. Mark your
  calendar: For best results, marinate for 19 days. Every 2 days turn
  the meat, using wooden spoons. Add water if necessary, but ONLY A
  LITTLE BIT, or the meat might spoil. At the end of the pickling
  period, discard the pickling water, and wash the meat with cold
  water. It is ready to cook

 Categories: Barbeque, Sandwiches, Chicken
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4    Boned chicken breasts
      1 c  Of barbecue sauce (whatever
           -you like)
  1 1/2 c  Of whole wheat flour or any
           -standard chicken
           Breading
      4 tb Butter
      4 tb Oil
           Barbecue spice (available at

      4    Fresh high quality kaiser
           -rolls
      8    Tomato slices
      4 lg Washed lettuce leaves
 
  Slightly flatten chicken breasts with mallet or meat cleaver.
  Submerge the breasts in barbecue sauce, cover and refrigerate for 12
  hours. Remove breasts from marinade and throw away the marinade. (It
  contains chicken blood and uncooked juices).  Wipe excess barbecue
  sauce from breast, shake barbeque spice on both sides of the breast
  and roll in flour or breading. Be sure that the flour or breading
  completely covers the chicken so that no frying oil can sneak in and
  get on the chicken. Heat butter and oil in a straight-sided frying
  pan and saute the floured chicken breast until cooked.  About 2 1/2
  minutes per side should do it. Press the chicken breast with your
  finger.  If the flesh feels soft and slightly mushy, it isn't cooked
  through yet.  If the flesh feels firm and bounces back, it is done
  and ready to eat. Serve open face on toasted kaiser rolls, garnish
  with lettuce and tomato slices. Serve with barbecue sauce on the side
  for dunking.

      Title: THE PERFECT BUTTERMILK BISCUITS
 Categories: Breakfast, Breads
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Shortening
  2 1/4 c  Flour
  2 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
      1 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/4 c  Buttermilk
 
  Place shortening in small plastic food bag. Flatten shortening between
  plastic sheets so it is thin and return to freezer. This allows
  shortening to become hard enough to break, into tiny pieces when
  added to dry ingredients. Tear 2 pieces wax paper about 15 inches
  long and place on counter, Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda,
  sugar and salt onto wax paper. Place empty sifter on top of bare
  sheet of wax paper, lift sheet of wax paper holding sifted dry
  ingredients by sides and pour through sifter, sifting onto bare wax
  paper. Sift back and forth 3 times, then sift once more into large
  mixing bowl. Remove shortening from freezer. Cut into small bits,
  about 1/4-inch square. Drop shortening bits into bowl of dry
  ingredients and, using fingertips, lightly rub shortening and flour
  together, occasionally tossing flour mixture so you touch all
  particles of shortening with flour. When mixture has bits of
  flour-covered shortening throughout, begin adding buttermilk. Using
  fork, add buttermilk, lightly stirring to mix with dry ingredients.
  Cover board or surface with dusting of flour. Gather sticky mass of
  dough and place on floured surface. Dust hands with flour and gently
  knead dough, adding enough flour only to make dough manageable. Pat
  dough with hands or roll with floured rolling pin into round 1/2-inch
  thick. Using 2-inch cutter, cut out biscuits and place touching each
  other in 3 rows, in center of greased baking sheet. Place on middle
  rack of 425-degree oven and bake 12 minutes, or until lightly golden.
  Remove from oven and serve hot or warm. Makes 19 (2-inch round)
  biscuits.

      1 c  Butter
  2 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      4    Eggs
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract

MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
      6 oz Semisweet chocolate pieces
    1/2 c  Light cream
      1 c  Butter
  2 1/2 c  Unsifted confectioners'
           -sugar

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 c  Heavy whipping cream
           -(chilled)
    1/4 c  Unsifted confectioners'
           -sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extracted
      1 pt Fresh strawberries, cleaned
           -and sliced
 
  In a medium bowl, combine cocoa with boiling water, mixing with wire
  whisk until smooth. Cool completely. Sift flour with soda, salt, and
  baking powder. Preheat oven to 350F. Grease well and lightly flour
  three 9 by
    1-1/2    inch lager cake pans.
  
  In a large bowl of an electric mixer, at high speed, beat butter,
  sugar, eggs, and vanilla, scraping bowl occasionally, until light -
  about 5 mins. At low speed, beat in flour mixture (in fourths),
  alternating with cocoa mixture (in thirds), beginning and ending with
  flour mixture. Do not overbeat.
  
  Divide evenly into pans, smooth top. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until
  surface springs back when gently pressed with fingertip. Cool in pans
  10 minutes. Carefully loosen sides with spatula, remove from pans;
  cool on racks.
  
  Frosting: In medium saucepan, combine chocolate pieces, cream,
  butter; stir over medium heat until smooth. Remove from heat. With
  whisk, blend in 2-1/2 cups confectioners' sugar. In bowl set over
  ice, beat until it holds shape.
  
  Filling: Whip cream with sugar and vanilla; refrigerate.
  
  To assemble cake: On plate, place a layer, top side down; spread with
  half of whipped cream and half of sliced strawberries. Place second
  layer, top side down; spread with the rest of the whipped cream and
  strawberries. Place third layer, top side up.
  
  To frost: With a spatula, frost sides first, covering whipped cream;
  use rest of frosting on top, swirling decoratively. Refrigerate at
  least 1 hour before serving. To cut, use a thin-edged sharp knife and
  slice with a sawing motion. Serves 10 to 12.

      Title: THE PERFECT PANCAKE
 Categories: Breakfast, Snacks
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      2 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Sugar
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Flour
      2    Eggs
  1 1/2 c  Milk
      3 tb Melted vegetable shortening
           -(margarine can be
           -substituted in a pinch)
 
  Sift baking powder, sugar, salt into a bowl. Add eggs, milk and
  shortening (shortening can melted in microwave at high for
  approximately 2.5 minutes). Mix all ingredients and scrape bowl. Heat
  fry pan or griddle to medium high. (Lightly grease pan or griddle
  with Pam or margarine.) Use 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake. Cook
  until bubbles form on the uncooked surface or the edges become dry.
  Turn pancake until golden brown on underside and serve. Option: The
  amount of milk can be varied to change the thickness of the pancakes.
  However, please note that the batter will rise during cooking so
  experiment by adding more milk as you cook to the remaining batter on
  your first batch. *********** The Pancake: There is rarely anything
  more satisfying than good pancakes, possibly because we rely so
  heavily on egg dishes for breakfast. Once you have your basic recipe
  almost anything can be added for any variation under the sun. Chopped
  apples, berries, nuts, even chopped chocolate can grace this simple
  dish. *********** The Problem: Most recipes call for a cooling period
  in the fridge for a number of hours which forces you to pre)predict
  what the family wants for the next day's breakfast or to cut the
  cooling time and produce pancakes the size and texture of bar
  coasters. Many run to Bisquick or Aunt Jemima for a commercial
  solution. Here is a batter which will produce better pancakes in less
  time, with more fun, to more acclaim, at a greatly reduced cost.

      6 oz Pineapple juice, frozen
           -concentrate, thawed
      6 oz Orange juice, frozen
           -concentrate, thawed
      6 oz Cranberry juice
      2 c  Strawberries, frozen
      1    Banana
      6 oz Lemonade, frozen concentrate
  2 1/2 c  Cold water
     30 oz Club soda, 1 bottle
     30 oz Ginger ale, 1 bottle
      2    Bottles 7-Up®
 
  * All frozen concentrates are to be thawed partially. ** Use as much
  7-UP or equal amounts of other soft drinks to make the punch to your
  taste.
  
  1. Using a blender, blend the juices a little at a time, pouring into
  large punchbowl or other large container. Blend the banana and
  strawberries only until coarse blended, not pureed. Mix the ice water
  in the punch bowl with other ingredients and stir to blend. 2. Just
  before serving, add the club soda, ginger ale and enough 7-Up to suit
  your taste. Stir gently to mix all juices from the sediment on bottom
  of bowl. Serve this as is or over ice.
  
  Serving Ideas : Serve this at any occasion for a non-alcoholic punch.
  
  NOTES : You may wish to make an ice ring to float in this for a
  decorative and festive touch. Using a ring mold, freeze a shallow
  layer of water, put fruits in a pattern on top of ice, pour a thin
  layer of water, refreeze. Repeat these steps until you have built up
  the ice ring and made several layers of fruit designs. Unmold the
  ring and place in punch bowl just before serving. Use juice instead
  of water for ice ring if you wish.

      Title: THE RO*TEL STORY
 Categories: Info
      Yield: 1 Info
 
           No ingredients
 
  RO*TEL originated in the sun-drenched Lower Rio Grande Valley of
  Texas, where for a long time it remained the best kept secret in the
  country. In the 1940s, cans were only shipped as far away as San
  Antonio and Houston and Dallas. Later, RO*TEL Tomatoes and Green
  Chilies had slipped their way to the foreign side of the Red River
  and were being sopped up in Oklahoma and Arkansas.
  
  In 1963, the wife of one of the country's best-known politicians in
  Washington bragged about her recipe for homemade chili in a national
  magazine. And, lo and behold, she wrote that her main secret
  ingredient was a healthy dose of RO*TEL Tomatoes and Green Chilies.
  
  The rest, as they say, is lots of tasty history. today, with southwest
  cooking rampant from sea to shining sea, RO*TEL can be found just
  about everywhere. It's the single best seasoning sauce for
  southwestern cooking a person's gonna find. You'll even find RO*TEL
  at a certain important address on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington,
  D.C. That's because the Number One favorite snack of the President
  himself, according to newspapers all over the country, if Famous
  RO*TEL Cheese Dip - the recipe right off the RO*TEL can, which is
  also printed here on page 3.
  
  If you haven't tried RO*TEL, you're in for a treat. As Crazy Sam puts
  it: "Have some and you'll wind up grinning like apossum that's been
  eating green persimmons."
  
  Only RO*TEL is a heckuva lot better.

      Title: THE TAHITIAN OVEN
 Categories: Tahiti, Info/tips, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Information
 
  The Tahitian stuff is basically pretty simple fare, but it requires
  all sorts of Tahitian veggies, fruits along with fish that I can only
  find in pet stores around here.
  
  There are some inconsistancies and maybe an incongruity or two in the
  definition and spelling of the regional ingredients. I copied them
  directly out of the book, so tain't my fault. Most of these terms and
  names have all the strange little marks over the vowels++much like
  written Vietnamese. I haven't even attempted to replicate those.
  
  The preparation of a ahima'a [Polynesian oven and its contents]
  requires a considerable amount of work and time.
  
  As most Tahitians nowadays have regular employment, they can seldom
  spare the time to cook in this manner and the tama'ara'a [meal]
  around the traditional ahima'a is generally reserved for week-ends or
  special occasions.
  
  To prepare for about 40 people, the hole in the ground should measure
  around 3 m long by 2 m wide by 0.80 m deep.
  
  Line the bottom of the oven with dry wood placed crisscross to
  facilitate the fire.
  
  Completely cover the wood with a layer of volcanic stones. Light the
  fire and allow it to burn out almost completely, until the red hot
  stones remain in the bottom of the oven. Cover these with some green
  branches and a bed of green banana leaves.  Season the pig and
  chicken and lightly baste with oil before placing them on the bed of
  leaves, together with all the other ingredients such as crayfish,
  fish, vegetables, bananas and breadfruit, all wrapped individually in
  leaves.
  
  Cover the food with several layers of banana leaves, then a layer of
  damp sacks before shoveling back enough sand or earth to fill the
  oven.
  
  Allow to cook for at least 3 hours.
  
  The opening of the ahima'a is quite a ceremony among Tahitians and
  all the guests usually assemble to witness the spectacle. It is
  surprising to find that all the ingredients are almost invariable
  cooked to perfection, the pork usually has a golden crust and the
  different dishes, despite having been cooked together in the same
  oven retain their particular odour and flavour.

      Title: THE TAMA'ARA'A (TAHITIAN)
 Categories: Tahiti, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  The tama'ara'a comes of course after the ahima'a.  It is the meal at
  which one eats what has been cooked in the ahima'a, together with the
  traditional raw fish, raw and cooked freshwater shrimps, raw and
  cooked crayfish, the mao'a [turbot] and the pahua taioro [clam
  marinated in juice of grated coconuts, seawater and shrimps], the
  mao'a or pahua with re'a [ginger], the miti [salt] hue [calabash],
  the miti ha'ari [coconut or coconut milk], the popoi [manioca or
  breadfruit paste], and of course the famous fafaru [fish marinated in
  seawater], the smell of which is always a little shocking to an
  outsider.  The usual drinks are beer, punch, red wine and water. Both
  for the preparations of the ahima'a and for serving the tama'ara'a,
  the Tahitians use traditional bowls, the 'umete made of wood. Some are
  beautifully decorated and are used to prepare the po'e [starch and
  stewed fruit preserve], the marinated raw fish, etc...
  
  Other kitchen utensils are; the penu or pestle, made in stone or
  coral; the hue or calabash, used to keep the mite hue or fafaru; the
  'ana or coconut scraper++though nowadays metal-pointed scrapers have
  replaced the traditional coral instrument, now only found in
  old-fashioned households.
  
  The tama'ara'a is not just a meal.  It has all the characteristics of
  a feast in the country and no effort is spared to make the table and
  the surroundings as colorful as possible, with plants, fruits and
  flowers.
  
  Each guest is received with great attention and is crowned with
  flowers; the tiare tahiti, the tipanie, the fara [pandanus]. On the
  ground or on a table covered with banana leaves (green ni'au [coconut
  palms]) the crockery is laid out; 'umete, hue, bamboo cups, green
  coconuts and split emptied coconut shells. Tradition demands that the
  ma'a [food] tahiti be eaten with the fingers and therefore no cutlery
  is laid out.
  
  A tama'ara'a is always a happy occasion.  The family meets, friends
  come together, and everyone is gay. There is music of course, because
  in Polynesia a meal starts and ends with singing. A small orchestra is
  improvised (all Tahitians are amateur musicians) with guitars,
  ukelele and bass.  (This bass is a unique instrument; it is built
  with a 20 litre oil-drum, a broomstick an a string tying one to the
  other, and the sounds are obtained by plucking the string.) Punch,
  beer and red wine contribute to the gaiety.

      Title: THE TEN COMMANDMENTS OF PICKLING - MARTHA STE
 Categories: Pantry, Soup/stews, Info
      Yield: 1 Info
 
           No ingredients found
 
  1. Use only the freshest ingredients, straight from the garden if
  possible. Avoid produce with a waxed coating; it won't absorb brine.
  
  2. Wash produce and cut off any bruised or discolored bits. Dirt and
  spoilage that wouldn't be harmful when eaten fresh could breed
  dangerous bacteria when seated in a jar.
  
  3. Use salt without additives, such as kosher or pickling salt. Avoid
  sea salt, which contains minerals, and iodized table salt.
  
  4. Only white and cider vinegars have high enough acid levels for safe
  pickling. If your pickles are too tart, don't decrease the
  vinegar-add more sugar instead. Never boil the syrup beyond the time
  specified; prolonged boiling breaks down acetic acid, making it too
  weak to prevent bacterial growth.
  
  5. Only jars specified for home canning are made to withstand the
  stresses and high temperatures of the process. Use vintage canning
  jars only if they are in perfect condition and can be used with new
  two-piece screw lids for a secure fit. Use the flat lid only once.
  Screw bands can be reused if they are rust-free and not bent.
  
  6. Keep everything at its proper temperature. Pickles, jars, and lids
  should be hot. Begin timing sterilizing of jars and water bath after
  the water has come to a boil.
  
  7. Leave pickles out to cool for twenty-four hours after processing.
  Before storing them, check seals: The lids should be taut and sucked
  slightly inward by the vacuum inside. Jars with loose seals should be
  refrigerated and the pickles eaten within a week.
  
  8. Date the pickles. "Mine could sit in the cabinet for ten years,"
  says Salli LaGrone. "I wouldn't want to serve them to company."
  
  9. Store jars in a cool, dry, dark place. Moisture affects the seal;
  light can bleach pickles.
  
  10. Inspect each jar before opening it. Press down on the lid; if it
  gives or "clicks," the seal has broken and the pickles must be
  discard- ed. When you open the jar, check for mold, leakage around
  the rim, gas or bubbling inside, funny smells, and slimy pickles. If
  any of these are the case, throw away the entire jar where children
  and pets will not find it.

      Title: THE TEN COMMANDMENTS OF PICKLING - MARTHA STE
 Categories: Pantry, Soup/stews, Info
      Yield: 1 Info
 
           No ingredients found
 
  1. Use only the freshest ingredients, straight from the garden if
  possible. Avoid produce with a waxed coating; it won't absorb brine.
  
  2. Wash produce and cut off any bruised or discolored bits. Dirt and
  spoilage that wouldn't be harmful when eaten fresh could breed
  dangerous bacteria when seated in a jar.
  
  3. Use salt without additives, such as kosher or pickling salt. Avoid
  sea salt, which contains minerals, and iodized table salt.
  
  4. Only white and cider vinegars have high enough acid levels for safe
  pickling. If your pickles are too tart, don't decrease the
  vinegar-add more sugar instead. Never boil the syrup beyond the time
  specified; prolonged boiling breaks down acetic acid, making it too
  weak to prevent bacterial growth.
  
  5. Only jars specified for home canning are made to withstand the
  stresses and high temperatures of the process. Use vintage canning
  jars only if they are in perfect condition and can be used with new
  two-piece screw lids for a secure fit. Use the flat lid only once.
  Screw bands can be reused if they are rust-free and not bent.
  
  6. Keep everything at its proper temperature. Pickles, jars, and lids
  should be hot. Begin timing sterilizing of jars and water bath after
  the water has come to a boil.
  
  7. Leave pickles out to cool for twenty-four hours after processing.
  Before storing them, check seals: The lids should be taut and sucked
  slightly inward by the vacuum inside. Jars with loose seals should be
  refrigerated and the pickles eaten within a week.
  
  8. Date the pickles. "Mine could sit in the cabinet for ten years,"
  says Salli LaGrone. "I wouldn't want to serve them to company."
  
  9. Store jars in a cool, dry, dark place. Moisture affects the seal;
  light can bleach pickles.
  
  10. Inspect each jar before opening it. Press down on the lid; if it
  gives or "clicks," the seal has broken and the pickles must be
  discard- ed. When you open the jar, check for mold, leakage around
  the rim, gas or bubbling inside, funny smells, and slimy pickles. If
  any of these are the case, throw away the entire jar where children

 Categories: Chocolate, Cakes
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      1 lb Bittersweet chocolate; coar
           -sely chopped
    1/2 lb Butter; unsalted
      6    Eggs; lightly beaten
           Chocolate ganache glaze
    2/3 c  Heavy cream
      6 oz Semi-sweet chocolate; finel
           -y chopped
 
  Fat grams    per serving:              Approx. Cook Time:
  :15 CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE: 1. Preheat the oven to 425F. Wrap the
  outside of an 8-inch springform  pan in a double layer of aluminum
  foil to prevent seepage.
   Butter the pan and line the bottom with a round of parchment or waxed
  paper.  Butter the paper. 2. Combine the chocolate and butter in a
  large metal bowl over a pan of hot - not simmering - water (the
  bottom of the bowl should not touch the water). Let stand, stirring
  occasionally, until the chocolate is smooth and melted. Or melt in a
  glass bowl in a microwave oven on high (100%), stopping and stirring
  every 15 seconds; remove the chocolate when there are still a few
  lumps and stir until completely smooth. 3. Put the eggs in a large
  mixer bowl set over simmering water and stir constantly until warm to
  the touch, about 3 minutes; remove from the heat.  With an electric
  mixer, beat the eggs until they triple in volume and form soft peaks
  when the beater is lifted, 5 to 8 minutes. (To ensure maximum volume,
  if using a hand-held mixer, continue to beat the eggs over simmering
  water until they are hot to the touch, about 5 minutes, then remove
  from the heat and beat until cool.) 4. Fold half the eggs into the
  melted chocolate until partially incorporated. Add the remaining eggs
  and fold until they are just blended and no streaks remain. 5. Pour
  at once into the prepared springform pan and smooth the surface with
  a spatula. Place in a larger roasting pan and add enough hot water to
  the pan to reach about two-thirds of the way up the springform. 6.
  Bake for 5 minutes. Cover the top of the springform loosely with
  lightly buttered aluminum foil and bake for 10 minutes longer. Remove
  the cake from the oven and let cool on a rack for 45 minutes; then
  cover and refrigerate until chilled and very firm, about 3 hours. 7.
  To unmold, run a small spatula or a blunt knife around the edge and
  remove the side of the springform. Carefully invert the cake into a
  plate that has been covered with plastic wrap and remove the bottom
  of the springform; peel off the parchment. Reinvert the cake onto a
  cardboard round or a cake plate. Cover and refrigerate for 6 hours or
  overnight, until thoroughly chilled, before serving. 8. If you want
  to cover the cake with a chocolate ganache glaze, set it on a rack or
  tuck strips of waxed paper around the bottom of the cake. Pour the
  tepid glaze onto the center of the cake, letting it cascade over the
  sides. Run a long metal spatula lightly across the top so that the
  glaze will not be too thick.  If necessary, use the spatula to patch
  any pare spots. Work quickly before the glaze sets. Prick any air
  bubbles with a needle or pin. Carefully remove any strips of waxed
  paper. Let the glaze stand undisturbed until set, 2 to 3 hours at
  room temperature, or 30 minutes in the refrigerator. CHOCOLATE
  GANACHE GLAZE: 1. In a small heavy saucepan, scald the cream.  Remove
  from the heat and immediately add the chopped chocolate. Cover and
  let stand for 5 minutes; then stir gently until the chocolate is
  fully melted and smooth. Let cool until tepid. 2. Stir the glaze to
  test it.  It is ready to use when a small amount mounds just a tiny
  bit when dropped from the spoon before disappearing into the mixture.
  If the glaze is too thick and the mound remainds on the surface, add
  warm water (or liqueur) by the teaspoonful, testing until the
  consistency is correct. If for some reason the glaze remains too
  thin, stir in more finely grated chocolate, heat until melted and
  then let cool again. Variations
  
  MINI-MOUSSE CAKE: This cake is perfect for serving 6 to 8. Make the
  Ultimate chocolate Mousse Cake, using 1/2 pound chocolate, 4 ounces of
  butter and 3 lightly beaten eggs. Bake in a 6-inch springform pan;
  temperature and baking remain the same. MOCHA FUDGE MOUSSE CAKE: Make
  the Ultimate Chocolate Mousse cake, prefereably using
  extra-bittersweet chocolate.  In step 2, add 2 tablespoons instant
  expresso powder to the melted chocolate and butter.  In step 5, pour
  halfe the chocolate mousse batter into the prepared springform pan
  and drizzle with have the Hot fudge (see recipe).  Add the remaining

      6 tb Unsalted chilled butter; cut
           Into 1/4" pieces
      6 tb Unsalted chilled butter; cut
           Into 1/4" pieces
      4 tb All-purpose vegetable
           Shortening; chilled
      3 tb To 4 T cold wate
    1/2 c  Graham cracker crumbs
           Lemon Filling:
      1 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
    1/8 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Cold water
      6 lg Egg yolks
      1 tb Zest from 1 lemon
    1/2 c  Juice from 2 or 3 lemons
      2 tb Unsalted butter
           Meringue Topping:
      1 tb Cornstarch
    1/4 ts Cream of Tartar
    1/2 c  Sugar
      4 lg Egg whites
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
 
  1.  For the pie shell, mix flour, salt, and sugar in food processor
  fitted with steel blade.  Scatter butter pieces over flour mixture,
  tossing to coat butter with a little of the flour. Cut butter into
  flour with five 1-second pulses.  Add shortening; continue cutting in
  until flour is pale yellow and resembles coarse cornmeal with butter
  bits no larger than a small pea, about 1-second pulses.  Turn mixture
  into medium bowl.
  
  2.  Sprinkle 3 tablespoons cold water over mixture. Using rubber
  spatula, fold water into mixture; press down on dough mixtue with
  broad side of spatula, fold water into mixture; press down on dough
  sticks together. If dough will not come together, add up to 1
  tablespoon more cold water. Shape dough into ball, then flatten into
  4-inch-wide disk. Dust lightly with flour, wrap in plastic, and
  refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling.
  
  3.  Generously spinkle work area with 2 tablespoons graham cracker
  crumbs. Place dough on work area. Scatter a few more crumbs over
  dough. Roll dough from center to edges, turning it into a 9-inch
  disk, rotating a quarter turn after each stroke and sprinkling
  additional crumbs underneath and on top as necessary to coat heavily.
  Flip dough over, and continue to roll, but not rotate, to form a
  13-inch disk slighly less than 1/8-inch thick.
  
  4. Fold dough in quarters; place dough point in center of 9-inch
  Pyrex pie pan.  Unfold to cover pan completely, letting excess dough
  drape over pan lip. To fit dough to pan, lift edge of dough with one
  hand and press dough in pan bottom with other hand; repeat process
  around circumference of pan to ensure dough fits properly and is not
  stretched. Trim all around, 1/2-inch past lip of pan. Tuck 1/2 inch
  of overhanging dough under so folded edge is flush with lip pan;
  press to seal. Press thumb and index finger about 1/2-inch apart
  against outside edge of dough, then use index finger or knuckle of
  other hand to poke a dent on inside edgeof dough through opening
  created by the other fingers. Repeat to flute around perimeter of pie
  shell.
  
  5.  Refrigerate until firm, aout 30 minutes. Prick shell at 1/2-inch
  intervals; press a doubled 12-inch square of aluminum foil into pie
  shell; prick again and refrigerate a least 30 minutes.
  
  6.  Adjust oven rack to lowest position, heat oven to 400 degrees.
  Bake, checking occasionally for ballooning, until crust is firmly
  set, about 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees, remove
  foil, and continue to bake until crust is crisp and rich brown in
  color, about 10 minutes longer.
  
  7.  For the Filling, mix first four ingredients in a large,
  nonreactivve saucepan.  Bring mixture to simmer over medium heat,
  whisking occasionally at beginning of the process and more frequently
  as mixture begins to thicken. When mixture starts to simmer and turn
  translucent, whisk in egg yolks, two at a time.  Whisk in zest, then
  lemon juice, and finally butter. Bring mixture to a good simmer,
  whisking constantly. Remove from heat, place plastic wrap directly on
  surface of filling to keep hot and prevent skin from forming.
  
  8.  For the meringue, mix cornstarch with 1/3 cup water in small
  saucepan; bring to simmer, whisking occasionally at beginning and
  more frequently as mixture thickens.  When mixture starts to simmer
  and turn translucent, remove from heat.  Leet cool while beating egg
  whites.
  
  9.  Heat oven to 325 degrees.  Mix cream of tartar and sugar
  together. Beat egg whites and vanilla until frothy. Beat in sugar
  mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time; until sugar is incorporated and
  mixture forms soft peaks. Add cornstarch mixture, 1 tablespoon at a
  time; continue to beat meringue to stiff peaks. Remove plastic from
  filling and return to very low heat during last minute or so of
  beating meringue (to ensure filling is hot). MM Norma_Wrenn

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 c  Cooked rice
      3 tb Butter
      1 ts Vanilla
 
  Combine milk, sugar, rice and butter in a sauce pan and simmer until
  thick about 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla.
  Serves 4, or 2 rice pudding freaks. You can use only half the amount
  of sugar and substitute Half-and-half for the milk. In case a rice
  pudding binge leads you to dieting, try the recipe with 1/4 cup of
  sugar or granulated sugar substitute and skim milk or skim evaporated
  milk. It is still super. It makes the best rice pudding for the least
  effort of any we've tried. You may also try sprinkling 1/4 teaspoon

   This dish was published by Toronto Star Starweek, Mary McGrath's
  Chef's Showcase in the issue of February 26 to March 5, 1994.
  
   The recipe was requested by Diane Silver of Willowdale, Ontario who
  writes:
  
   The Lemon Poppyseed Cake at The Vegetarian Restaurant ( 4 Dundonald
  St., Toronto, (416) 961-9522 is "absolutely enjoyable and I am hoping
  you can publish their version of this classic cake for me".
  
   "We are pleased to share this recipe and suspect the request came
  because the cake is unusually moist and has a wonderful strong lemon
  flavour", says Susan Stachyra, who manages the bakeshop where
  desserts for the downtown restaurant and The West End Vegetarian
  Restaurant are turned out. Before getting into the baking business 1
  1/2 years ago, the former school teacher from North Bay, Ontario says
  that baking was a hobby. Typed into Meal Master format by Eric Decker
  March 19, 1994.
  
   Editor's note: If there is any way humanly possible: use real
  demerara sugar. Take my word for it, it is near impossible to
  duplicate it by adding molasses to granulated sugar. It looks okay
  but the flavour just is NOT right for the purist. Posted by Eric to

      Title: THE WOK
 Categories: Info/tips, Wok
      Yield: 1 Info
 
           No ingredients
 
  It is not known exactly when the Chinese first used woks. By examining
  extant funerary stoves and stone relief pictures of the Han Dynasty
  (200 B.C. to 220 A.D.), the author conjectures that they definitely
  have been used for at least two thousand years. Since the Chinese wok
  is a concave shaped cooking pan without seams or corners, it war
  probably invented to fit directly over the round hole of the Chinese
  cooking stove. Wood was used to fuel the cooking stove. When the wok
  was put over the cooking hole, the rounded bottom of it would become
  the hottest part of it, while the upper sides remained somewhat
  cooler. To take advantage of this heating condition, the Chinese
  "chow" or stir fry pieces of food that have been cut up into bite
  size quickly in the wok. The high heat at the bottom of the wok seals
  in the individual flavours of each ingredients. With a quick stir of
  the wrist, all of the flavours of the ingredients are blended
  together to form harmonious or contrasting tastes and textures.
  
  Deep frying and steaming may also be performed in the wok. The wok is
  actually an all purpose cooking utensil for the Chinese. Except for a
  very good Chinese cleaver and a pot for cooking rice, that is all
  that a Chinese really needs to prepare his meals.

      1    4 1/2 lb leg of lamb
      3    Cloves
           Garlic
           Olive oil
           Black pepper, ground
      6    Fresh rosemary sprigs
 
  Trim the excess fat on the meat, but leave a thin layer. Make 1"
  slits all over the meat, and insert a slice of garlic into each slit.
  Rub well with a liberal coating of olive oil, and then coat heavily
  with salt and pepper. Wrap securely with plastic wrap, and
  refrigerate for at least several hours ~ the longer, the better!
  
  Preheat the oven to 500F. Heat an oven-proof skillet large enough to
  hold the lamb comfortably. Remove the lamb to a platter, and pour off
  all but 1 T. olive oil. Cover the bottom of the pan with the
  rosemary. Place the lamb on top, and cover the lamb with more
  rosemary. Place in the oven, and reduce oven temperature to 375F
  after 20 minutes. Roast 40 minutes longer. To serve: take the lamb,
  in its pan, outside. Ignite the rosemary on the top of the lamb.
  Allow the fire to burn itself out. Brush off the woody stems. Let
  rest 10-15 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter, and enjoy!

      Title: THERESA'S SHORT-SKIRT CHILI
 Categories: Beef
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 lb Beef skirt; (tenderized, if
    1/4 c  Honey
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
      4 cn Green chilies; (4-oz each)
      3    Tomatoes
      1 lg Onion; white
      6    Dried chili anchos
      2    Cl Garlic
      2 ts Ground cumin
      1 ts Oregano; (mexican)
      1 ts Paprika
 
  Recipe by: Wayne Preston Allen Cut the stems from the anchos, and
  remove seeds. Cover with boiling water and let sit for an hour. Blend
  in blender with the garlic until smooth.
  
  Slightly warm the honey and mix in the soy sauce. Coat beef skirt
  with meat tenderizer (if you think necessary) and honey-soy and let
  sit 15 minutes. Cook beef skirt on very hot grill, basting often with
  honey/soy mixture. I prefer a fairly charred result. When done
  properly, this activity should remind you of watching the Kuwaiti oil
  fields on CNN. Warning - this procedure produces yummy-tasting
  carcinagens!
  
  Cut beef skirt across the grain into 1/4" strips, and set aside a
  little for snacking. Dice the green chilies, onion, and tomatoes. Add
  the beef, vegetables, and spices to large pot. Add half the ancho
  sauce and water or beer to barely cover. Add more ancho sauce over
  time to suit your taste. Cook until meat is really tender, which, for
  skirt, could be days. (Just kidding!)

      Title: THICK SOUR CREAM
 Categories: Condiments, Mexican
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 pt Heavy cream
      2 tb Buttermilk
 
  Recipe by: The Cuisines of Mexico by Diana Kennedy ISBN 0-06-012344-3
  Many recipes from central Mexico call for cream. it should be
  slightly sour, liek the creme fraiche of France. I suggest that you
  make your own, which is far more satisfactory that using the
  commercial brands.
  
  Put the cream and buttermilk into a glass jar and mix them well
  together.
  
  Cover with plastic wrap and set the mixture aside in a warm place,
  but not too warm (a strong pilot light is too warm; the cream will
  taste "cooked" and a skin will form) until it is set, about 6 hours.
  Put the crem into the refrigerator overnight; it will thicken and
  become more solid.
  
  Some creams will sour more quickly, and some become thicker than
  others. The milk experts inform me that these are uncontrollable
  factors depending on the culture of the buttermilk, the amount of
  light and heat to which the cream was exposed before it was used, and
  even the bateria in one's own kitchen.
  
  For Thin Sour Cream you can substitute light for heavy cream.

 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2    Medium-sized potatoes per
           -serving
           Cold water
           Crisco Shortening to fry
           -potatoes
 
  Using knife or French-fry cutter, cut peeled potatoes into 1/4"
  strips. Rinse or soak in cold water.  Start heating enough Crisco
  Shortening to fill a 3-quart saucepan half full, or a deep fryer
  within 1/2" of the fill mark.  Dry potato strips thoroughly on paper
  towel.
  
  FOR EXTRA QUICK FRENCH FRIES:  Heat deep Crisco Shortening to 365
  degrees F.  For electric deep fryer, follow manufacturer's directions
  for amount of potato strips to fry at one time. For saucepan, cook
  2-3 cups of potato strips at one time, adding slowly. Cook until
  potatoes are tender and lightly browned, about 10-15 minutes. Drain
  potatoes on paper towel. While frying remaining potatoes, keep fried
  ones warm in oven set at low temperature.  Salt or season as desired.
  If desired, frozen French fried potatoes can be used in place of
  fresh potatoes. For best results, fry about 10-15 minutes in Crisco
  Shortening using the above directions.
  
  FOR EXTRA CRISP FRENCH FRIES (FOR FRESH POTATOES ONLY): Fry potatoes
  FIRST time at 325 degrees F. for about 3 minutes. Remove and drain on
  paper towel. Cool at least 15 minutes at room temperature. If
  desired, cool up to 3 hours.  To serve, re-heat crisco to 365 degrees
  F. and fry potato strips a second time for 6-8 minutes or until
  golden brown. Drain on paper towel.
  
  This recipe has been on the Crisco label since 1938.

      Title: THIN RICE CAKES
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      2 c  Rice (white or brown)
      6 c  Water
      2 ts Salt, to taste
           Parchment paper or wax
           Paper
 
  Combine the rice, water, and salt in a large saucepan, cover, and
  bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to simmer. Cook for 45 to 60
  minutes, until all the water is absorbed and the rice is quite soft.
  
  "Cooked whole grain rice and salt are the only ingredients in these
  crispy thins. It may take you a couple of tries to perfect the
  rolling technique. They key to success is to cook the rice in more
  water and for much longer than you would ordinarily. It should be
  very soft and mushy. Eat these rice cakes with fruit and cheese, or
  crack them into soups. 325~ F 45 to 55 minutes Preheat the oven to
  325~ F.
  
  Taste the rice and add salt to taste. Stir the rice well with a fork
  until mushy. Cut six sheets of parchement paper or wax paper the size
  of your largest baking sheet. (Parchment paper works best.) While the
  rice is still warm, measure out a third of it, about one cup, into
  the center of a sheet of the paper. Using your hands, shape the rice
  into a flat disk.
  
  Place a second sheet of paper over the rice and roll out to about
  3/16 inch thick. Keep the thickness as uniform as possible
  throughout. Carefully peel off the top sheet of paper.
  
  If you are using parchment paper, simply place the rolled rice, bottom
  sheet of paper and all, on an ungreased baking sheet.
  
  If you are using wax paper, you will need to grease your baking sheet
  lightly. Then pick up the wax paper and rolled rice and flip it, rice
  side down, onto the sheet. Then carefully peel the wax paper off the
  top. The wax paper may stick to the rice, but don't worry if holes
  form in spots. You are going to crack these crisps up anyway when
  they cool. Use a metal spatula to loosen the wax paper if necessary.
  
  Bake for 45 to 55 minutes, or until crisp. Begin rolling the next 2
  crisps while the first is baking. If the edges get done before the
  centers, gently break them off and allow the rest to continue baking.
  
  Cool the large crisps on racks and break into irregularly shaped
  individual crackers. Yield: 3 large rice cakes.
  
  VARIATIONS: Add 2 to 3 Tablespoons toasted sesame seeds, or your
  favorite herbs, to the rice after cooking.

      Title: THIT BO KHO (GRILLED DRIED BEEF)
 Categories: Vietnam, Beef/veal
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Lean bottom round or
           -sirloin, in one piece,
           -about 6 inches in
           Diameter
      2    Stalks fresh lemon grass,
           -or 2 tablespoons dried
           -lemon grass
      2 sm Red chile peppers, seeded
  2 1/2 tb Sugar or honey
      1 tb Nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish
           -sauce)
      3 tb Light soy sauce
 
  Here's a Vietnamese version of beef "jerky" made with red chilies and
  honey or sugar that sounds like it's off in the direction of your
  Chinese Dried Fried Beef recipe.
  
  This Vietnamese-style "beef Jerky" is delicious served with drinks.
  The Vietnamese enjoy eating it as a snack with glutinous rice. It is
  also an ingredient in Green Papaya Salad.
  
  Cut the beef across the grain onto very thin 3 by 3 inch slices. If
  you are using fresh lemon grass, discard the outer leaves and upper
  half of the stalk. Cut into thin slices and finely chop. If you are
  using dried lemon grass, soak in warm water for 1 hour. Drain and
  finely chop.
  
  Combine the chiles and sugar in a mortar and pestle and pound to a
  fine paste.  Add the chopped lemon grass, fish sauce and soy sauce
  and stir to blend. (If using a blender, combine all of these and
  blend to a very fine paste.) Spread the paste over the beef pieces to
  coat both sides. Let marinate for 30 minutes.
  
  Spread out each slice of marinated beef on a large, flat wire rack or
  baking sheet.  Let stand in the sun until both sides are completely
  dried, about 12 hours. (You can also place a rack on a jelly roll pan
  and let the beef dry in the refrigerator for 2 days.)
  
  Grill the beef over a medium charcoal fire or transfer the rack from
  the refrigerator to the middle of a preheated 400F oven and bake
  until brown and crisp, about 10 minutes.
  
  Serve with glutinous rice.
  
  NOTE:  After cooking, the meat may be kept for up to 1 week in a
  covered jar at room temperature.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

 Categories: Vietnam, Beef/veal, Appetizers
      Yield: 60 Servings
 
      5 tb Nuoc mam (vietnamese fish sa

      4 ts Potato starch
      1 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Sugar, granulated

      2 lb Trimmed boneless beef hind s

      4    Garlic cloves; crushed
      1 ts Oriental sesame oil
           Vegetable oil, for shaping m
           -eatballs
 
        In a shallow dish, mix the fish sauce, potato starch, baking
  powder, sugar and black pepper.
        Slice the meat into 1/8-inch-thick pieces. Add to the mari-
  nade and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or
  overnight.
        Before proceeding, transfer the meat to the freezer for 30
  minutes.
        Work with half of the beef at a time; do not overload the work
  bowl. In a food processor, combine half of the beef with half of the
  garlic and sesame oil. Process to a completely smooth but stiff
  paste, about 3 minutes. Stop occasionally to scrape  down the sides
  of the work bowl. The completed paste should spring back to the
  touch. Transfer the paste to a bowl. Process  the remaining beef,
  garlic and sesame oil the same way.
        Rub some vegetable oil on one hand. Grab a handful of the meat
  paste and close your hand into a fist, squeezing out a small portion
  of the mixture, about 1 teaspoon, between your thumb and index
  finger. Keep rolling and resqueezing the same portion between your
  thumb and index finger until you obtain a smooth rounded ball. Scoop
  out the meatball with an oiled spoon. Repeat until all of the paste
  is used.
        Pour 1 inch of water into a wok or wide pot. Place a steamer
  rack or bamboo steamer over the water. Arrange the meatballs without
  crowding in a single layer on the rack. Cover and steam for 5 minutes.
        Serve as an appetizer with chili sauce. These beef balls can
  also be added to a well-seasoned beef broth, sprinkled with chopped
  scallions and black pepper and served as a soup (noodles may be
  added).
        Note: These meatballs may be frozen. Thaw them thoroughly, then
  steam or simmer in boiling water until just heated through.
       Yield: about 60 meatballs.

 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 tb Sesame oil
    1/4 lb Broccoli florets
     12    Asparagus tips
      2    Carrots, julienned
      1 sm Zucchini, cut into wheels
    1/4 lb Snow peas
      1 md Red pepper, julienned
      1 md Green pepper, julienned
      1 lb Tofu, cut into thin strips
      2    Scallions, chopped
           Tamari or soy sauce to taste
 
  Thom Christopher may have walked away with an Emmy for his role as
  drug kingpin Carlo Hesser on ONE LIFE TO LIVE, but he says his
  mother, Nancy, swept the awards when it came to talent in the
  kitchen. "My mother was the most incredible Italian cook," recalls
  Christopher (who was transformed into jewel expert Mortimer Bern on
  the ABC show after his character Carlo was murdered). "What's always
  fascinated me about my mom is that she could work and come home and
  unexpectedly make meals for 20 people and upward." Which is exactly
  what she did one evening in 1961 for Christopher and a group of
  actors who had been rehearsing all afternoon: "Everyone said, 'What
  are we going to do with a party of 24?' I called home and said, 'Mom,
  I'd like to bring the company home for dinner', and she said, 'How
  many?' I said, 'About 24.' By the time we got home, she had made
  chicken with tomato sauce, shells in tomato sauce, stuffed braciola,
  chicken soup with escarole. To this day, we all remember that awesome
  meal."
  
  Christopher's mom passed on her passion for cooking. The actor now
  enjoys his own elaborate dinner parties with his wife, Judy, in their
  Manhattan town house. Judy creates the entrees while Christopher
  whips up the appetizers and desserts - from tuna-fish specialties to
  banana trifle.
  
  His recipe for sauteed tofu and vegetables - which can be served as an
  appetizer or a side dish - reflects his cooking philosophy. "I
  believe in economy in the kitchen," he says. "You can eat very nicely
  without spending the kitchen sink."
  
  Coat the cooking area of a wok or deep frying pan with sesame oil and
  heat until very hot. First, saute broccoli, asparagus, and carrots
  for a few minutes. Then add zucchini, snow peas, and peppers and cook
  for another minute or two. Add tofu and scallions last. Saute
  everything in sesame oil for 2 more minutes. Then add tamari or soy
  sauce to taste and cook a little longer, until vegetables are tender
  but not overcooked. Vegetables should be stirred frequently and
  cooking time should not exceed 20 minutes.

  Thom Christopher may have walked away with an Emmy for his role as
  drug kingpin Carlo Hesser on ONE LIFE TO LIVE, but he says his
  mother, Nancy, swept the awards when it came to talent in the
  kitchen. "My mother was the most incredible Italian cook," recalls
  Christopher (who was transformed into jewel expert Mortimer Bern on
  the ABC show after his character Carlo was murdered). "What's always
  fascinated me about my mom is that she could work and come home and
  unexpectedly make meals for 20 people and upward." Which is exactly
  what she did one evening in 1961 for Christopher and a group of
  actors who had been rehearsing all afternoon: "Everyone said, 'What
  are we going to do with a party of 24?' I called home and said, 'Mom,
  I'd like to bring the company home for dinner', and she said, 'How
  many?' I said, 'About 24.' By the time we got home, she had made
  chicken with tomato sauce, shells in tomato sauce, stuffed braciola,
  chicken soup with escarole. To this day, we all remember that awesome
  meal."
  
  Christopher's mom passed on her passion for cooking. The actor now
  enjoys his own elaborate dinner parties with his wife, Judy, in their
  Manhattan town house. Judy creates the entrees while Christopher
  whips up the appetizers and desserts - from tuna-fish specialties to
  banana trifle.
  
  His recipe for sauteed tofu and vegetables - which can be served as an
  appetizer or a side dish - reflects his cooking philosophy. "I
  believe in economy in the kitchen," he says. "You can eat very nicely
  without spending the kitchen sink."
  
  Coat the cooking area of a wok or deep frying pan with sesame oil and
  heat until very hot. First, saute broccoli, asparagus, and carrots
  for a few minutes. Then add zucchini, snow peas, and peppers and cook
  for another minute or two. Add tofu and scallions last. Saute
  everything in sesame oil for 2 more minutes. Then add tamari or soy
  sauce to taste and cook a little longer, until vegetables are tender
  but not overcooked. Vegetables should be stirred frequently and
  cooking time should not exceed 20 minutes.

      Title: THOROUGHLY MODERN MEATLOAF
 Categories: Beef, Microwave
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Ground beef; (more or
           -less)
      3 sl Bread, to 4 sliced
      1    Onion; peeled &
           -quartered
      2 tb Parsley, dried
      1 ts Spearmint, dried
      1    Garlic clove
    1/4 ts Olive oil; for flavor
           Salt & pepper; to taste
      2 tb Feta; crumbled (more or
           -less to taste, opt)
      1    Egg; (optional, use less
           -bread if omitting)
 
  Tear the bread into a food processor bowl. Pulse until it becomes
  crumbs. Toss in the onion, garlic, oil and spices. Pulse to blend and
  chop. Add the meat and cheese as small hunks. Process until it forms
  a ball that rolls around in the processor bowl. If using the egg, add
  it along with the meat or after processing the meat a bit, but before
  it forms a ball. Place the meat into a microwave loaf pan. (I use a
  pan made for the purpose that has a shelf which holds the meat up out
  of the fat.) Micro-cook at 70% for 10 to 15 minutes. Check for
  doneness with the instant thermometer (160 F.). I use a turntable. If
  you don't have one, you will need to rotate the pan two or three
  times during cooking. Slice thin, and serve with yogurt cucumber
  dressing (tzatziki), though my husband prefers catsup.

      Title: THOUSAND-YEAR-OLD EGGS
 Categories: Cheese/eggs, Chinese
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2 c  Very strong black tea
    1/3 c  Salt
      2 c  Each ashes of pine wood,
           Ashes of charcoal and ashes
           From fireplace
      1 c  Lime*
     12    Fresh duck eggs
 
      These are often called thousand-year eggs, even though the
  preserving process lasts only 100 days. They may be purchased
  individually in Oriental markets.
  
      Combine tea, salt, ashes and lime. Using about 1/2 cup per egg,
  thickly coat each egg completely with this clay-like mix- ture. Line
  a large crock with garden soil and carefully lay coated eggs on top.
  Cover with more soil and place crock in a cool dark place. Allow to
  cure for 100 days. To remove coating, scrape eggs and rinse under
  running water to clean thoroughly.
   Crack lightly and remove shells. The white of the egg will appear a
  grayish, translucent color and have a gelatinous texture. The yolk,
  when sliced, will be a grayish-green color.
  
      To serve, cut into wedges and serve with:
  
      Sweet pickled scallions or any sweet pickled vegetable
  
      Sauce of 2 tablespoons each vinegar, soy sauce and rice wine and 1
  tablespoon minced ginger root.
  
      *Available in garden stores and nurseries.
  
      The description of the whites turning grayish isn't quite
  accurate from the ones I've seen. They're more a dark blackish amber
  color-- quite attractive actually.

      Title: THREE CHEESE CHICKEN BAKE
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8 oz Lasagna noodles
    1/2 c  Onions, chopped
    1/2 c  Bell peppers, chopped
 10 1/2 oz Soup, cream of chicken
      4 oz Mushrooms
    1/2 c  Pimientos, chopped
    1/2 ts Basil leaves
  1 1/2 c  Cheese, cottage
      2 c  Chicken; cooked
    1/2 c  Cheese, parmesan, grated
 
  For low-fat result, use skim milk, lowfat cottage cheese, and
  Campbell's Special Request cream of mushroom soup. Turkey may be
  substituted for chicken.
  
  Preheat oven to 350.  Cube chicken. Cook noodles for about 10 minutes
  in spaghetti blancher or large pot. Combine onions and pepper in
  small amount of water in saucepan and cook until onion is tender.
  
  Drain, then add soup, mushrooms, pimiento, milk, and basil. Layer
  HALF of soup mixture, half of cottage cheese, half of chicken, and
  half of parmesan in casserole. Repeat layers. Cover and bake for 30
  minutes.
  
  Sylvia's comments: don't ask me why this is a "three cheese" bake when
  there are only two types of cheese. I skipped the onion and bell
  pepper and substituted chopped green olives for the pimiento. I also
  used three-color rotini (which I had) for the lasagna noodles I
  didn't have. Came out great. Definitely a keeper.

      Title: THREE CHEESE PIZZA
 Categories: Pizza, Breads, Appetizers
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2    New classic pizza dough
      2 c  Fresh tomato pulp/sauce
      2 c  Diced mozzarella
      1 c  Diced swiss cheese
    1/4 c  Grated parmisan cheese
      1 ts Oregano,thyme,basil (mixed)
      1 tb Olive oil
           Salt & pepper to taste
 
  Fat grams    per serving:              Approx. Cook Time: 1/2 hour At
  least 30 minutes before baking, preheat your pizza stone or oven
  tiles to 450 degrees. Flatten the dough and form into a ball by
  folding the left side two thirds over onto the right side. Flatten
  the dough, pushing from right to left. Turn a quarter turn and
  repeat. Repeat this rapidly until you have a cushion of dough smooth
  on the bottom. Now turn the dough "smooth side up" and rotate the
  dough between your hands while tucking the dough under itself. This
  will increase the tension on the top of the dough and make a nice
  ball shape. Flatten the dough into a disk using a floured rolling
  pin. When the dough resists, allow it to rest a few minutes covered
  loosely with a towel or floured plastic wrap. Repeat this until you
  have a circle with a 14 to 16 inch diameter. If the dough is at all
  sticky, flour both sides heavily. Sprinkle your piel with cornmeal.
  Roll the dough up on your rolling pin and transfer to the piel.
  Adjust the dough as needed and quickly assemble the pizza. Brush the
  surface lightly with olive oil. Spread the tomato sauce evenly over
  the surface leaving a 1/2 inch boarder. Garnish the surface with the
  mixed cheeses, add the herbs and drizzle the olive oil over the
  surface. Add salt & Pepper and finish with a sprinkling of Parmesan.
  Open the oven door, position the piel at the back of the stone or
  tiles and give the piel a few quick jerks to make sure the pizza is
  loose and will slide!! Pull the piel back and the pizza will slide
  onto the stone. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes. The cheese should be
  bubbling and the edges should be browning lightly.

 Categories: Condiments, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Here are three recipes for flavored oils for various uses.
  
  ROASTED RED PEPPER OIL:
  
  Puree 1/2 cup roasted red peppers (homemade or commercial). Stir into
  2 cups oil.  Let stand at room temperature until color and flavor are
  pronounced, about 1 week. Strain and refrigerate. Use for dressings or
  drizzled over pizza, pasta and shrimp. Lasts about 6 months.
  
  Makes a little over 2 cups.

  fat (1 g saturated), 0 mg cholesterol, 0 mg sodium, 0 g fiber.
  
  BASIL OIL:  From John Ash.
  
  Blanch a bunch of basil (this will keep it bright green) and dry
  well. Put in blender or food processor and add oil to cover well.
  Blend and put in jar. Allow to settle; strain. Keeps refrigerated for
  10 to 12 days. For using decoratively, put in little plastic squirt
  tubes.
  
  PER TABLESPOON:  120 calories, 0 g protein, 0 g carbohydrate, 14 g
  fat (1 g saturated), 0 mg cholesterol, 0 mg sodium, 0 g fiber.
  
  CHILE OIL:  From "From Pantry to Table, " by Mark Spieler.
  
  Pour 1 cup oil over 2 tablespoons crumbled small hot dried chile
  peppers or red pepper flakes, depending on heat of peppers and your
  own taste. Some chiles (such as bird's eye) are incendiary and need
  to be used sparingly. For more pronounced flavor, gently heat the
  chile oil. A bay leaf or two may be added.  Drizzle onto pot stickers
  along with soy sauce and a strong, sour vinegar.
  
  Makes 1 cup.

      2    Oranges
      2    Lemons
           Sugar
           Salt
 
    Here's a marmalade recipe with some really citrus-y pizzazz! This
  will make about 12 6-oz. jars... Scrub the fruit and slice very thin,
  saving the juice. Discard the seeds and the grapefruit core. Measure
  the fruit and juice.  Put the fruit and juice in a large pot and add
  three times as much water.  Simmer, covered, for 2 hours, and then
  let stand overnight. Measure the fruit and liquid, then add an equal
  amount of sugar and a sprinkle of salt.  Cook rapidly, in two or
  three batches, until the jellying point (when jelly slides off cold
  metal spoon in a sheet rather than in separate droplets) is reached,
  stirring frequently. Pour into hot, STERILIZED jars and seal. Susan

      Title: THREE MEAT STEW WITH VEGETABLES (PICHELSTEINE
 Categories: Soups/stews, German
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 tb Lard
  1 1/4 lb Pork and beef as well as
           -lamb or mutton (mutton
           -gives
           An excellent flavor), cut
           -into 3/4 inch cubes
      2 md To 3 md onions, diced
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
           Crushed marjoram
      3 md Potatoes, peeled and finely
           -diced
      1 sm Celery root, peeled and
           -diced, OR 4 celery
           Stalks, diagonally sliced
    1/2 lb Carrots, peeled and
           -diagonally sliced
      1 lg Leek (white part only),
           -washed and sliced
      2 c  Beef stock
           Chopped fresh parsley
 
  Heat the lard in a heavy bottomed pot (or ovenproof Pyrex casserole
  or the like).  Lightly sear and mix together the meat cubes and the
  onions; season with salt, an ample amount of pepper, and a very
  little bit of crushed marjoram.  Remove two thirds of the meat and
  onions from the pot and set aside.
  
  Mix the potatoes and vegetables together; spread a third of these
  over the bottom layer of meat cubes in the pot or casserole. Sprinkle
  with salt and a little pepper. Alternate 2 more layers of meat with 2
  more layers of vegetables.  Each layer should be separately seasoned
  with salt and pepper; the top layer MUST consist of vegetables and
  potatoes. Pour in the beef stock. Cover tightly and cook over
  medium-low heat for just about 2 hours. Cooking in a 350 degrees F
  oven is also possible. You should not stir the stew, but you can tilt
  the pot back and forth to circulate the liquid and prevent the bottom
  layer from burning. Serve sprinkled with chopped parsley.
  
  Variations:
  
  Savoy cabbage is frequently added to the roster of vegetables, and it
  tastes delicious.  Sliced kohlrabi would be fine as well.
  
  For a truly gourmet 'Pichelsteiner', 6 to 8 slices of bone marrow
  should be briefly sauteed with the onions at the beginning, then
  added to one of the in-between layers of meat. Doubling of
  ingredients is advisable. Pichelsteiner tastes excellent reheated.
  
  Makes 4 servings.
