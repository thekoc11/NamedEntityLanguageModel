Basic Bread & Rolls

breads, rolls

3/4 cup milk
1 fresh cake yeast
1/4 cup sugar
3 tablespoon shortening
1 teaspoon salt
1  egg
3 1/2 cup flour
1/4 cup lukewarm water

Scald milk and pour over sugar, shortening, & salt. Let it cool to
lukewarm while softening yeast in a small bowl with the warm water.
When soft, add the egg and beat together slightly. Pour the yeast/egg
mixture into the milk mixture and stir them together. The flour may
be sifted or poured into the liquid. With a large spoon, stir until
flour/milk is well mixed. You should have a firm, but not stiff
dough. Without removing it from the bowl, cover the dough with a
plate or towel and set aside to rise until double in bulk (about 2
hrs depending on the temperature in the kitchen). Instead of letting
the dough rise at this point you may put it in the refrigerator and
use it later, or the next day.  Watch to make sure it doesn't spill
out of the bowl.  If it starts to spill before you're ready to use
it, punch it back down. Refrigerated dough is easier to handle but
takes longer to rise. BREAD: If you want to make bread, dump the
dough out of the bowl onto a floured surface and with more flour as
needed to keep it from sticking, knead it until springy and easy to
handle. This dough does not require a lot of kneading; only enough to
make it easy to handle. For 2 medium size loaves cut the dough in
half and knead/shape each into loaves and put into greased baking
pans. Allow about 2 hours for the dough to double again. Bake in a
375 degree oven until lightly browned on top (if uncertain whether or
not bread is done, tip out of pan and see if bottom is browned too).
ROLLS: To make rolls, work and knead dough until springy and easily
handled. Roll out with a rolling pin and cut with a biscuit cutter
and fold over and place on a greased cookie sheet (Parkerhouse
rolls), or break dough into small pieces, make into little balls and
place 3 in each section of a greased muffin pan (Cloverleaf rolls).
SWEET ROLLS: For Christmas bread or sweet rolls, roll out dough as
for Parkerhouse rolls, except trying to make an oblong instead of a
round. Spread it with raisins and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar.
Dot with butter and roll as for a jelly roll.  Slice and place on a
greased pan or make into a circle and make slashes through the dough
at intervals. Let rise and bake as for loaves. Top with an icing made
of confectioners' sugar, melted butter, milk, and vanilla or rum
flavoring and drizzle over the bread or rolls while hot. Decorate
with nuts or fruits. If you want to make a whole wheat bread, use
half white and half whole wheat flour, and use brown sugar instead of
white.  The amounts above will yield 1 large or 2 medium loaves of
bread, or 2 dozen large rolls.

Basic Dinner Rolls

breads, rolls

6 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 cup water
1 cup milk
1/2 cup margarine/butter
1  egg

	   Melted margarine/butter if 	 Desired

In large bow;, combine 2 cups flour, sugar, salt and yeast; blend
well. In small saucepan, heat water, milk and 1/2 cup margarine until
very warm (120-130 F.). Add warm liquid and egg to flour mixture.

By hand, stir in an additional 2 1/2 to 3 cups flour until dough
pulls clenaly away from sides of bowl. On floured surface, knead 1
1/4 to 1 3/4 cups flour until dough is smooth and elastic, about 8 to
10 minutes. Place dough in greased bowl; cover loosely with plastic
wrap and cloth towel. Let rise in warm place (80 to 85 F.) until
light and doubled in size, about 45 to 60 minutes. Punch down dough
several times to remove all air bubbles. Divide dough in half. To
make PAN ROLLS, lightly grease two 13x9-inch pans. Divide each half
of dough into 16 equal pieces. Shape each into a ball, pulling edges
under to make a smooth top. PLace balls, smooth side up, in greased
pans. Cover; let rise in warm place until light and doubled in size,
about 20-30 minutes. Heat oven to 400 F. Uncover dough. Bake at 400
F. for 16 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Remove rolls from pans
immediately; cool on wire racks. Brush with melted margarine.

TIP: To make dough a day ahead, after first rise time, punch down
dough, cover and refrigerate dough overnight. Shape dough as directed
in recipe; let rise a second time until light and doubled in size,
about 25 to 35 minutes. Source: The Complete Pillsbury Book of Baking

Cardamom Rolls

breads, rolls

1  portion four-way sweet 1 egg yolk
1  bread dough 1 tsp. cream or canned; milk
8  pods whole cardamom

*Use Grated Raw Potato Starter

Remove cardamom seeds from pods and crush in mortar or place in small
plastic bag and use rolling pin. Flatten the ball of dough. Sprinkle
crushed seeds over surface and knead until evenly distributed through
the dough.  Divide in twelve pieces and shape as desired for muffin
tins. They can be made into a plain ball and then, after the top is
generously buttered, cut deeply with a Kaiser cutter or slashed with
a deep cross in the top with sharp knife or scissors. They are also
nice made up in brioche shape.  Cut off about 1/4 of the dough and
make a tiny ball to place firmly on top of the larger ball before
brushing all over with butter. When light, bake for about 25 minutes
in oven preheated to 350. About 5 minutes before the end of the
baking period brush the tops of the rolls with the egg yolk and cream
beaten together. Bake to a golden, glossy brown. These rolls are
perfect for serving with a chilled fresh fruit salad and whipped
cheese spread.

Cheese Rolls - Large Recipe - Red Lobster

breads, rolls

1 teaspoon garlic salt or powder
1 teaspoon italian seasonings
44 oz cold water
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1 tablespoon parsley flakes
5 lb bisquick
1 lb cheddar cheese,grated

Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mix bisquick, water and cheese. Drop by
large spoonfuls onto greased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes.
After baking, (while hot) brush on melted butter or margarine mixed
with garlic powder, parsley flakes and italian seasoning. (Amounts
will vary by the size batch you make, but a little goes a long way.)
Serve hot.

The Red Lobster manager's recipe is for a large quantity, so you'll
have to reduce the ingredient quantities by the size batch you
desire. Note: For a smaller batch I usually use 2 C. Bisquick, 1/2
cup cold water, and 3/4 c. grated cheddar which will yield about 12
biscuits.

You may also substitute soda water or gingerale for the water, if
desired. From: Hp_walls@woco.Ohio.Gov

Cheese Rolls - Small Recipe - Red Lobster

breads, rolls

1  garlic salt -- or powder
1  parsley flakes
1  italian seasonings
2 cup bisquick
1/2 cup cold water -- scant cup
3 oz sharp cheddar cheese --
1  grated
1 oz butter -- or margarine

My Notes: When the Red Lobster restaurant that we go to started
serving their cheese rolls, I managed to talk the manager out of this
recipe. It's been posted numerous times since 3/90 by me and by
Elaine Radis and others. The quantities I've given are as the manager
gave me. Later, I cut the ingredient quantities down to be more
useable by the average family. These do freeze, however, so it's
worthwhile making the larger batch and freezing the ones you do not
plan to use immediately.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mix bisquick, water and cheese. Drop by
large spoonfuls onto greased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes.
After baking, (while hot) brush on melted butter or margarine mixed
with garlic powder, parsley flakes and Italian seasoning. (Amounts
will vary by the size batch you make, but a little goes a long way.)
Serve hot. The RL manager's recipe is for a large quantity, so you'll
have to reduce the ingredient quantities by the size batch you desire.

NOTE: this recipe has already been reduced.

Chocolate Cinnamon Rolls

breads, rolls

1 pkg active dry yeast or
1 tablespoon active dry yeast, bulk
1/4 cup warm water (110-115f)
1/2 cup milk, lukewarm (scald, then cool to; lukewarm)
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup shortening
1  egg, large
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup cocoa
2 1/4 cup flour, unbleached
2 tablespoon margarine or butter, softened
1/4 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, ground
      ----POWDERED SUGAR FROSTING----
1 cup powdered sugar, sifted
1 tablespoon milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla

Dissolve the yeast in the warm water in a large bowl. Stir in the
milk, 1/4 c. of the sugar, the shortening, egg and salt. Mix the
cocoa with the one and one quarter cup of the flour and add to the y
east mixture. Mix with a spoon until smooth.  Mix in enough of the
remaining flour to make the dough easy to handle, but still slightly
sticky and soft. Turn out on a lightly floured board and knead until
smooth and elastic, about 8-10 minutes. Let the dough rest while you
wash the mixing bowl, dry and grease it with shortening.  Put the
dough into the bowl, turning to grease the top. (At this point, the
dough can be covered and refrigerated 3-4 days, punching it down when
it gets too big for the bowl.) Cover and let rise in a warm place
until double, about 1-1/2 hrs. (Dough is ready when an indentation
remains when touched.) Punch the dough down and roll into a rectangle
12/9 inches. Spread the rectangle with the softened margarine and mix
the 1/4 c. of sugar and the cinnamon together, sprinkling it over the
buttered dough when done.  Rull up, beginning at the 12-in. side and
when fully rolled up, pinch the seam to seal.  Cut the roll into 12
slices and place slightly apart in a baking pan 9x9x2 inches. (For
larger rolls, place in 13x9x2 in. pan and let rise until it fills the
pan.) Cover and let rise until double, about 40 minutes.  Heat the
oven to 375F. Bake 25-30 minutes. Spread with powdered sugar frosting
while still warm. Mix frosting ingredients together until reaching a
spreading consistency. Makes enough frosting for 12 rolls. (Increase
amounts for larger rolls.)

1  cake compressed yeast (or)
1  cake dry yeast
1 cup white corn-meal
1 tablespoon salt
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup lukewarm water
4 cup boiling water
1 cup melted shortening
2 cup potato water flour

Make a sponge of the yeast, 1/2 cup water, and 3 tablespoons flour.
Cover and allow to stand until light. Sift corn-meal slowly into the
boiling water, add salt, and stir constantly until thick. Cook over
hot water 30 minutes.  Add shortening, sugar, and potato water
(prepared by boiling 1 cup diced potatoes in 2 cups water). Stir
until well blended. Cool. Add the sponge.  Add sufficient flour to
make a dough stiff enough to knead. Turn onto lightly floured board.
Knead until smooth and elastic. Cover with a damp cloth and allow
dough to double in bulk. Knead down. Cover closely and place in
refrigerator. Remove portion of dough required from refrigerator 2
hours or more before rolls are needed. Allow dough to warm to room
temperature.  Form into rolls.  Place in well-oiled pans. Cover and
let rise until treble in bulk. Bake in hot oven (450ø F) about 15
minutes. The unused portion of the dough should be worked down,
covered closely with waxed paper, and returned to the refrigerator
until needed. 75 rolls. Mrs. L. Carlile, Sheridan, WY.

Cottage Cheese Pan Rolls

breads, rolls

2 pkg yeast
1/4 cup warm water
3 cup smooth cottage cheese
1/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2  eggs
1/2 cup warm water
6 cup or more flour

Dissolve yeast in warm water till foamy. Heat till warm, the cottage
cheese, sugar, salt, baking soda and 1/2 cup water. Add the yeast
mixture and 1 cup flour and beat smooth with electric mixer.Gradually
stir in by hand more additional flour to knead into a smooth , soft
but elastic dough. Place in an oiled bowl, cover and let rise until
double and light in volume. Punch down and shape into 24 pieces or as
large or small you want them. Roll each piece into a ball shape.
Place balls side by side in greased pan ( pans ) and let rise until
light and double in volume in a warm place.Sprinkle tops of rolls
with flour prior to baking for a bakery look. Bake in a preheated 350
degree oven about 20 minutes or golden. I bring these to parties and
bake in those disposable aluminum pans.

Comment: I use small curd cottage cheese which blends more easily
than the large curd and gives these rolls a wonderful flavor and
texture.

Crusty Rolls (Ew)

breads, rolls

1 teaspoon malt extract or brown sugar
1 pkg active dry yeast
5 1/2 cup (approx) bread flour or unbleached; all-purpose flour
1/4 cup nonfat dry milk
1 tablespoon salt
1  cornmeal for dusting baking sheets

In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 1/2 cups lukewarm water and malt
extract or brown sugar; sprinkle yeast on top and let stand until the
yeast is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Gradually stir in 3 cups of the
flour, stirring in the same direction for 3 minutes. Stir in nonfat
drymilk and salt. Then gradually add more of the remaining flour
until the dough becomes too difficult to stir.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, gradually
incorporating more flour as needed to prevent sticking, until smooth
and elastic, about 10 minutes. (Alternatively, the dough can be
kneaded in a stand-up mixer fitted with a dough hook).

Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turn to coat and cover with
plastic wrap.  Let rise until almost tripled in volume, 2 1/2 to 3
hours. Punch dough down; cover and let rise until doubled, about 1
1/2 hours. (Or, you can let the dough rise for the second time
overnight in the refrigerator.)

Lightly oil 2 baking sheets or spray with nonstick cooking spray;
sprinkle with cornmeal.  Punch the dough down, turn out onto a
lightly floured surface and knead into a smooth ball. Divide the
dough into 16 portions. Shape each portion into a ball, then roll to
make a slight oval. As you work, keep any dough that you are not
using covered. Place the rolls at least 2 inches apart on the
prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle rolls with flour and rub gently over
the surfaces. Cover with a dry tea towel and let rise until almost
doubled, about 1 hour.

Thirty minutes before baking, place a baking stone or an inverted
baking sheet on the center rack of a cold oven. Place a metal cake
pan on the bottom rack; preheat to 425 F. Just before baking, pour 1
cup water into the cake pan.  Working with one batch at a time, cut a
1/4 inch deep slash with a serrated knife along the top of each roll.
Place the baking sheet on the baking stone or until the rolls are
golden brown and bottoms sound hollow when tapped.  Transfer to a
wire rack and let cool. Add more water to the cake pan, slash the
remaining rolls and bake them in the same manner. (The cooled rolls
can be stored in a plastic bag in the freezer for up to 3 months.  To
serve, arrange the frozen rolls on a baking sheet and heat in a 350F
oven for 10 to 15 minutes.

Easy Parker House Rolls

breads, rolls

1 1/4 cup milk; scalded
2 teaspoon butter or regular margarine
2 pkg active dry yeast; or
1/4 cup lukewarm water; 110 deg. f.
2 teaspoon butter or margarine; melted
3 teaspoon sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon active dry yeast; bulk
4 1/2 cup unbleached flour

Pour the scalded milk over the sugar, 2 tbls of butter and salt in a
mixing bowl.  Cool to lukewarm. Sprinkle the yeast over the lukewarm
water and stir to dissolve. Add 2 cups of flour, and the yeast
mixture to the milk mixture.  Beat, with an electric mixer on medium
speed, until smooth, about 2 minutes. Gradually add enough of the
remaining flour to make a soft dough, then cover and let rest for 15
minutes. Knead the dough a few times on a lightly floured surface
until it is no longer sticky and roll out to a 1/2-inch thickness.
Cut into rounds, using a floured biscuit cutter. Brush the rounds
with the remaining 2 Tbls of melted butter and crease each roll in
the center with the dull edge of a knife. Fold the rolls over on the
crease and press the edges together lightly. Place on greased baking
sheets and cover. Let rise in a warm place until almost doubled,
about 30 minutes. Bake in a preheated 400 degree F. oven for 10
minutes or until golden brown.  Remove from the baking sheets and
cool on wire racks. NOTE: These rolls are almost a must at the
Holiday dinners coming up shortly. Restaurants and most older cooks
make it a tradition to serve them.

Easy Refrigerator Rolls

breads, rolls

6 1/4 cup flour, all-purpose
1/2 cup sugar
2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon yeast, dry (each pk is about 1 t)
1/2 cup milk
1 1/2 cup water
1/4 cup butter
1  egg
1  vegetable shortening or more butter

Combine 2 cups of flour, sugar, salt and undissolved yeast.

Heat milk, water and butter until liquids are very warm (120-130 degrees
F.). Add to dry ingredients. Beat 2 minutes at medium speed (I've never
used an electric mixer, by the way. Just stir until things are evenly
combined and not terribly lumpy.) Add egg and about 1 cup flour. Beat at
high speed 2 minutes. Add enough additional flour to make a soft dough.
This is where the arm muscles get their exercise!

Grease top of dough (with butter or vegetable shortening).  Cover the bowl
and refrigerate it overnight.

Divide the dough into 24 equal pieces.  Shape them into balls and place
each in a greased muffin cup. Cover; let rise in a warm place (75-100
degrees F.) until doubled. This will take between 1 and 1 1/2 hours.
Towards the end of the rising period, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Bake at 400 degrees F. for 12 to 15 minutes. Store the rolls tightly
covered, that is, if there are any left.

NOTES:

*  An utterly reliable recipe for yeast rolls -- I believe this recipe
started its life on the back of a Fleischman's Yeast package, but it has
been memorized and modified for about ten years now. It is the most
reliable yeast recipe I've ever seen: it's never failed on me, and it
always does an amazing amount of rising (my family calls them mushroom
rolls).

*  This is the first really good yeast bread recipe I discovered when I
started making bread in the sixth grade.  Done carefully, it can approach a
delicate, cake-like texture.  It doesn't have to be shaped into rolls, of
course -- try it in a regular bread pan, or in fancy shapes.

*  I use Fleischman's dry yeast.  I suppose cake yeast can be used, but it
always seemed like a nuisance to me.

Elegant Asparagus Beef Roll With Teriyaki Sau

breads, meats, vegetables, rolls, chinese

1  beef, loin
      ----FILLING----
1  asparagus, fresh
1  mushrooms, inoki
1  mushrooms, shitake,
1  onions, green
      ----MARINADE FOR THE BEEF----
1 teaspoon wine, rice
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1 large egg white
1 dash ginger, ground
1 dash cornstarch
1 dash garlic, minced
1 dash pepper, black
      ----SAUCE----
2 tablespoon teriyaki sauce
2 tablespoon broth

Preparation: ============

Cook the asparagus by boiling, steaming, stir-frying or microwaving
until it's tender.  (The whole spear with the tough end cut off
should be kept whole.) Steaming takes 2 to 3 minutes. Stir-frying 1
to 2 and so on. Use whatever method you prefer.

Prepare the marinade for the beef by mixing all of the ingredients
well and setting them aside.

Prepare some braising sauce for the cooking and set aside.

Slice your beef loin into very thin slices.  Put them in a small
baking dish or shallow bowl and cover with marinade ingredients. Stir
well to mix and set in a refrigerator for ten minutes or more.

Cooking: ========

Take one of the marinated slices of beef and "fill" it with some
Inoki mushroom, some Shitake mushroom, a little green onion, and
steamed asparagus and roll the beef. Use a toothpick to secure the
meat.

Brown in a little peanut oil (two rolls per person as a serving).

Add the braising sauce (Teriyaki and broth) and cover, cooking over
medium heat for three to four minutes until done.

Serve rolls with cooked rice, and garnish with drippings from the
pan and some Inoki mushrooms.

Frances Cook's Bread & Rolls

breads, rolls, londontowne

3/4 cup milk
1 each fresh cake yeast
1/4 cup sugar
3 tablespoon shortening
1 teaspoon salt
1 each egg
3 1/2 cup flour
1/4 cup lukewarm water

Scald milk and pour over sugar, shortening, & salt. Let it cool to
lukewarm while softening yeast in a small bowl with the warm water.
When soft, add the egg and beat together slightly. Pour the yeast/egg
mixture into the milk mixture and stir them together.
The flour may be sifted or poured into the liquid. With a large spoon,
stir until flour/milk is well mixed. You should have a firm, but not
stiff dough. Without removing it from the bowl, cover the dough with
a plate or towel and set aside to rise until double in bulk (about 2
hrs depending on the temperature in the kitchen). Instead of letting
the dough rise at this point you may put it in the refrigerator and
use it later, or the next day. Watch to make sure it doesn't spill
out of the bowl. If it starts to spill before you're ready to use it,
punch it back down. Refrigerated dough is easier to handle but takes
longer to rise.
BREAD:
If you want to make bread, dump the dough out of the bowl onto a
floured surface and with more flour as needed to keep it from
sticking, knead it until springy and easy to handle. This dough does
not require a lot of kneading; only enough to make it easy to handle.
For 2 medium size loaves cut the dough in half and knead/shape each
into loaves and put into greased baking pans. Allow about 2 hours for
the dough to double again. Bake in a 375 degree oven until lightly
browned on top (if uncertain whether or not bread is done, tip out of
pan and see if bottom is browned too).
ROLLS:
To make rolls, work and knead dough until springy and easily handled.
Roll out with a rolling pin and cut with a biscuit cutter and fold
over and place on a greased cookie sheet (Parkerhouse rolls), or
break dough into small pieces, make into little balls and place 3 in
each section of a greased muffin pan (Cloverleaf rolls).
SWEET ROLLS:
For Christmas bread or sweet rolls, roll out dough as for Parkerhouse
rolls, except trying to make an oblong instead of a round. Spread it
with raisins and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Dot with butter
and roll as for a jelly roll. Slice and place on a greased pan or
make into a circle and make slashes through the dough at intervals.
Let rise and bake as for loaves. Top with an icing made of
confectioners' sugar, melted butter, milk, and vanilla or rum
flavoring and drizzle over the bread or rolls while hot. Decorate
with nuts or fruits.
If you want to make a whole wheat bread, use half white and half whole
wheat flour, and use brown sugar instead of white. The amounts above
will yield 1 large or 2 medium loaves of bread, or 2 dozen large
rolls.

Giant Overnight Cinnamon Rolls

breads, rolls

      ----MM FORMAT BY MARY ANN YOUNG----
      ----ROLLS----
1 pkg pillsbury hot roll mix
2 tablespoon sugar
1 cup water; heated to 120-130
2 tablespoon butter or margarine; soft
1  egg
      ----FILLING----
1/4 cup butter or margerine; soft
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup raisins
1/4 cup finely chopped nuts
      ----GLAZE----
1 1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon butter or margarine; soft
2 tablespoon 2-3 tb milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla

Grease 13x9x2 inch pan. In large bowl, combine flour mixture with
yeast from foil packet and 2 tb sugar; blend well. Stir in HOT water,
2 tb margarine and egg until dough pulls away from sides of bowl.
Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. With greased or floured
hands, shape dough into a ball. Knead dough for 5 minutes until
smooth. Cover with large bowl; let rest 5 minutes.

On lightly floured surface, roll dough to 15x10 inch rectangle.
Spread 1/4 cup margarine or butter evenly over dough. In small bowl,
combine 1/3 cup sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle with raisins and nuts.
Starting with 10-inch side, roll up tightly, pressing edges to seal.
Cut into 6 slices and place, cut side down, into greased pan. (At
this point, dough can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated
overnight. Dough may rise in refrigerator. If necessary, let dough
stand at room temperature before baking until almost doubled in
original side. Then, bake as usual).

If baking same day, you still cover loosely with plastic wrap and
cloth towel. Let rise in warm place (80-85 degrees) until almost
doubled, about 30 minutes. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Then, uncover
dough and bake rolls for 20-30 minutes till golden brown. Cool 1
minute. Remove from pan and cool for 10 minutes. (This keeps bottom
from getting soggy.)

Drizzle glaze ingredients over rolls which may have been placed back
in pan first.

TIP: To speed up the process of rising, I heat oven to about 200
degrees for 5 minutes or so, then turn it off before putting pans in
just to rise before final baking. I do this when you can't ensure
room being at proper warmth or drafty. Otherwise, rolls will take too
long to rise and will be either heavy in consistency or too small.)

The Wooden Spoon Bread Book.  These rolls are delicately flavored with
garlic, both in the dough and in the filling. Mix all ricotta filling
ingredients together. To soften yeast, in a large mixing bowl combine
first 3 ingredients.  Let stand 5 minutes. Stir next 4 ingredients
into softened yeast mixture. Beat well. To make a soft dough,
gradually add 1 to 1 1/4 cups flour.  Turn out on  a floured surface
and knead until smooth. Place in a well-buttered bowl, turning dough
once to butter the top. Cover and let rise until doubled in bulk, 45
to 60 minutes. Meanwhile, mix together butter and garlic.  Punch down
dough. Toss on a lightly floured surface until no longer sticky. Roll
dough out to a 9 by 12 inch rectangle. With a short side facing you,
spread bottom 2/3 of rectangle with 1/2 of butter mixture.  Fold top
third of dough down over the center third. Fold bottom third of dough
up over this. Press edges to seal. Wrap dough in plastic and
refrigerate 15 minutes. Roll and fold again, using no butter. Wrap
and refrigerate 1 hour. Divide dough in half. Seal cut edges by
pinching together. Working with one-half of the dough at a time, roll
into a 12-inch circle. Using a sharp knife, cut circle into 12 equal
wedge-shaped pieces. Near the wide end of each piece place 1 tsp
Ricotta filling. Starting with the wide end, roll each wedge to the
point. Place, point side down, on lightly greased or nonstick baking
sheets. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.  Before
baking, brush tops of rolls wiht a mixture of egg white and water.
Bake in preheated 375 degree oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until
golden brown. Serve warm. Makes 24 rolls.

Gooey Homemade Cinnamon-Raisin Rolls

breads, rolls

1  stephen ceideburg
      ----ROLLS----
2 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 pkg active dry yeast
1 cup skim milk
1/4 cup margarine
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1  egg
3  egg whites
2 1/4 cup whole-wheat flour, approximately
      ----FILLING----
1/2 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
1/4 cup whole-wheat flour
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup margarine
3/4 cup raisins
1  nonstick cooking spray

To make rolls: Combine all-purpose flour and yeast in a large mixing
bowl; set aside. In a small saucepan over low heat, combine milk,
margarine, sugar and salt. Stir just until the margarine starts to
melt (120 to 130 degrees). Add to the flour and yeast mixture, mixing
well.

Add egg and egg whites to the flour mixture and beat with an electric
mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping the sides of the bowl
constantly. Beat on high speed for 3 minutes. Using a spoon, stir in
as much of the whole-wheat flour as you can.

Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead in enough of
the remaining flour to make a soft dough that is smooth and elastic,
kneading for about 4 minutes. Shape into a ball and place in a bowl
which has been sprayed with a nonstick cooking spray. Turn ball over
once and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1
hour.

To make filling: While dough is rising, make the filling. Combine
brown sugar, flour and cinnamon in a medium bowl and mix well. Cut in
the margarine until crumbly, using two knives or a pastry blender;
set aside.

To form: Punch dough down and turn onto a lightly floured surface.
Cover and allow to rest 10 minutes. Roll dough out into a 12-inch
square and spread filling evenly over the dough. Top with raisins and
roll up tightly like a jelly roll, pinching to seal the seam. Cut
roll into eight 1 1/2-inch slices and arrange slices, cut side up, in
a 9-by-13-inch baking dish sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Cover
the dish loosely with clear plastic wrap and allow to rise again
until almost double in size, about 45 minutes.

To bake: Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Before baking, remove the
plastic wrap and lightly spray the tops of the rolls with a nonstick
cooking spray. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until lightly brown. If
the rolls start to get too brown, cover them with foil the last 5 to
10 minutes of baking.

Remove rolls from oven and allow to cool 2 minutes. Invert onto a
wire rack and allow to cool slightly. Invert them again onto a
serving dish. Serve warm or allow to cool to room temperature and
freeze for future use.

Makes 8 rolls.

Grammy's Dark Rolls

breads, rolls, holiday

1/2 cup oatmeal (rolled oats)
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup shortening
2 tablespoon molasses
2 tablespoon honey
1 cup water, boiling
1/2 cup water, warm
1/2 oz yeast (dry), active (2 packages; do not use quick-rising y
1 teaspoon honey
1  egg
2 1/2 cup flour, unbleached (up to 3 1/2 c)

Combine oatmeal, whole-wheat flour, salt, shortening, molasses and honey.
Pour boiling water over all.  Mix and let cool.

While cooling, dissolve yeast in warm water with the honey.  Add egg to
cooled batter, then mix in dissolved yeast.

Add flour until dough is just soft enough to knead.  Knead lightly. Place
dough in a greased bowl; cover with a damp cloth.  Let rise in warm place
until  doubled in bulk; about one hour.

Punch down dough and cut into 12 equal pieces.  Shape each piece into a
ball in put into a greased 9-inch pan. Let rise again for 45 minutes.

Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees F. for 40 minutes.

NOTES:

*  Holiday rolls with oatmeal and molasses -- This recipe has long been
part of my Thanksgiving tradition. I have long since forgotten its source.

*  These rolls are really wonderful, but they need time to rise. start them
as early in the day as possible. Don't even think about using the
quick-rise yeasts.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  several hours preparation, 1 hour baking and cooling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup honey
2 tablespoon unsalted butter or margarine, melte; d
1 cup bread flour
1 1/4 cup whole-wheat flour
1  oil for pan

These rolls have a soft texture ands delicate flavor but a firm
crust. They look very inviting, deeply browned with a dusting of
flour. They make great moderately sized sandwiches.

Basic Sponge

In processor fitted with metal blade, mix Basic Sponge with butter-
milk, salt, honey and melted butter until smooth. Combine flours and
add to sponge mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, pulsing several times to
incorporate each addition. Process dough until supple, elastic and
sticking slightly to work bowl, about 1 minute, adding more water or
flour by teaspoon, if dough is too dry or too wet. Dough should be
very sticky, almost wet.

Transfer dough to large plastic bag, squeeze out all air and seal
tightly at top to allow room for dough to expand. Set bag in bowl and
let dough rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.

Divide dough in half. Cut each in half again, then quarter into 4
equal pieces, about 2 1/2 ounces each. Shape each piece into round
roll by pinching bottom of dough. Place 2 inches apart on large oiled
baking sheet, pinched-bottom down. Sprinkle with flour. Drape loosely
with plastic. Let dough rise in warm place until almost doubled,about
1 hour. If desired, use kitchen shears to make deep cross-stitch
slash in rolls.

About 15 minutes before baking put rack in middle of oven and set
oven to 400 degrees F.. Bake until rolls are deeply browned and sound
hollow when raped on bottom, about 20 minutes. immediately remove
from pan and place on wire rack. Makes 16 rolls.

Honey-Orange Pecan Sourdough Rolls

breads, rolls, breakfast, sourdough

1/2 cup starter
1 pkg yeast
1/4 cup warm water
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup butter; melted
1/4 cup honey
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 1/4 cup flour; approx.
      ----FILLING----
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon orange peel; grated
1/4 cup honey
1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup pecans
1 teaspoon orange extract

Soften yeast in water; stir in milk, batter, butter, honey, and salt.
Gradually mix in 3 c of the flour; dough will be sticky. Turn dough
into a greased bowl, turn over to grease top; cover, and let rise in
a warm place until double in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead until smooth,
about 5 min.; add flour if necessary to prevent dough from sticking.
Roll dough out into a 12x15 inch rectangle; spread orange-nut filling
evenly over dough. Starting with the long side, roll up jelly-roll
fashion. Cut across roll into 15 slices about 1 inch each and
arrange, cut-side-up in a well greased 9 by 13 inch baking pan.
Cover and let rise until almost double, about 45 minutes.

Bake in a 350^ oven for 35 minutes or until browned on top. Transfer
rolls to a serving board; quickly scrape out any syrup in pan and
spread it over rolls.  Serve them warm or reheated in a 350^ oven,
lightly covered with foil, for about 20 minutes.  Makes 15 rolls.

Note:  I would like to try this with cinnamon instead of the orange
flavoring.

Hot Yeast Rolls

breads, rolls

2 pkg active dry yeast
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1/4 cup water,very warm
1/4 cup butter,cut into small pieces
2 cup milk,warm
6 cup flour,all-purpose
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter,melted

1. In a large bowl sprinkle yeast and sugar over warm water (should
feel comfortably warm when dropped on wrist) and allow to stand until
bubbly, about 10 minutes. 2. Combine butter and milk in top of double
boiler over simmering water until butter has melted and milk is warm.
Add to yeast mixture and stir until blended. Mix in 2 cups of the
flour, 1 cup at a time, and beat well to form a spongy dough. Cover
and let rise in a warm place until double in bulk, about 1-1/2 to 2
hours. Stir down with wooden spoon, then add about 3 more cups of
flour to form a moist dough that is firm enough to turn out onto a
well-floured board. 3. Dip hands in flour and knead dough until
smooth and nonsticky, adding additional flour as needed. The dough
should be velvety-smooth. 4. Form into a ball and place in a
well-buttered, warm mixing bowl. Turn ball of dough so that entire
surface of dough is coated with softened butter. Cover and again
place in a warm place until double in bulk, about 1 hour. 5. Punch
dough down, turn out onto a lightly floured board, and let rest for
about 5 minutes. 6. Roll out to a thickness of about 1/2 inch cut
with a floured knife first into approximate 2-inch squares, then into
triangles. Roll up from wide side to point and place on baking sheet
about 1/4 inch apart. When all are prepared, brush with melted butter
and again let rise until about double in bulk, about 30 minutes. 7.
Bake in a preheated 350'F. oven until lightly browned, 25 to 30
minutes, depending on size. To test for doneness gently tap top of
roll for a hollow sound or break open one roll to see if it is
sufficiently baked in the center.

Ice-Box Rolls

breads, rolls

1  cake dry yeast
1  or 1  cake compressed yeast
1  egg, well beaten
2 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoon sugar
2 cup lukewarm water
3 tablespoon melted shortening
6 1/2 cup flour

Soften yeast in lukewarm water.  If dry yeast is used combine the
sugar, yeast, and water and allow to stand in a warm place 1 1/2
hours. If compressed yeast is used allow to stand in lukewarm water 5
minutes. Add salt, egg, sugar, if sugar has not already been added,
and shortening. Mix well.  Add flour, a little at a time, beating
thoroughly after each addition until dough is stiff enough to knead.
Knead on lightly floured board until the dough is smooth and elastic.
Cover dough with a warm, damp cloth.  Set in a moderately warm place
and allow to stand 2 hours. Work down, cover closely with waxed
paper, and place in the refrigerator overnight.  If baking rolls for
luncheon or dinner, remove desired portion of dough from the
refrigerator and allow about 2 hours to warm to room temperature and
become light. Form into rolls. Cover and let rise until treble in
bulk. Place on well-oiled baking sheet. Bake in hot oven (450x F)
about 15 minutes. This dough will keep for 1 week or 10 days in a
refrigerator if it is worked down each day to prevent its becoming
too light.  The dough should be kept closely covered with waxed paper
to prevent a crust from forming over the surface. 32 rolls.

Injera (Ethiopian Flat Round Breads)

rolls, ethiopia

1  to make about 16 nine-inch-round br; eads.
5 tablespoon all purpose flour
3 cup aunt jemima's deluxe easy pour panc; ake mix
1/4 teaspoon backing soda
3 1/2 cup club soda at room temperature
1 1/2 cup water

Combine the flour, pancake mix and baking soda in a deep bowl.
Stirring constantly with a whisk or spoon, pour in the club soda and
water in a slow stream and continue to stir until the mixture is a
smooth , thin cream. Strain the batter through a fine sieve set over
a clean bowl, pressing down hard on any lumps with the back of a
large spoon. Cook the injera in a 10 inch skillet or omelette pan
with a non-stick cooking surface or a well-seasoned 10 inch cast iron
skillet. Warm the ungreased pan over moderate heat until it is just
hot enough to set the batter without browning it. To test the heat,
pour 1 tablespoon of the batter into the centre of the pan.  The
bottom surface should solidify immediately without becoming brown.
For each injera, remove the pan from the heat and ladle in 1/4 cup of
the batter. Then quickly tip the pan back and forth to cover the
bottom evenly. Cover the pan partially and cook the bread over
moderate heat for 1 minute, or just until the top is spongy, moist
and dotted with tiny air holes.  The bottom should be smooth, dry and
somewhat shiny. Do not let the bottom brown; otherwise the edges may
become too crisp. Remove the pan from the heat and use a spatula or
your fingers to lift the injera gently out of the pan.  Lay it on a
plate to cool, and ladle another 1/4 cup of batter into the pan,
tipping and spreading the batter evenly. Repeat the cooking process,
and when the next injera is done, transfer the cooled bread to a
platter and place the hot injera on the plate. Continue making the
breads in the same fashion with the remaining batter. To serve,
spread 7 or 8 injera out in a shallow or flat basket or on a large
platter, letting them overlap each other and rape over the edge of
the container. Fold the rest of the injera into quarters and arrange
them attractively in the centre.  To eat them tear off a small piece
and use it to scoop up food.  In Ethiopia, injera is served with
almost every meal, and is a traditional accompaniment to such dishes
as doro wat, sik sik wat and zilzil alecha. ++

Kouloura Rolls & Buns

breads, rolls, greek

1  karen mintzias
2 tablespoon dry or cake yeast
1/2 cup warm water
2 cup milk; warm
3 tablespoon sugar; -or-
5 tablespoon sugar; if making koulourakia
3 tablespoon butter, margarine or oil
3/4 teaspoon salt
7 cup all-purpose flour; unsifted
1  egg
      ----TOPPING----
1  egg yolk
1/4 cup sesame seeds

Melt yeast in warm water.  Set aside.  Bring milk to
boil.  Add sugar, butter and salt.  Allow milk to cool
slightly.

Put flour in a large bowl leaving about a tablespoon
of it in the measuring cup for hands and make a hole
in the center.  Pour liquid into it. Add yeast and
egg.  Start mixing with spoon or paddle, pushing flour
from all sides into center.  Dough will be sticky
until flour is absorbed. Begin kneading dough in the
bowl and then transfer it to a lightly floured board.
Continue kneading until dough is smooth and elastic,
about 20 minutes.

Place dough in a greased bowl.  Cover with towel
dampened with hot water. Set aside in a warm place to
rise until bulk has doubled, about 4 hours.

Punch down in the middle.  Knead for a few minutes and
shape into a round loaf or into individual rolls (see
below).  Using fingers, rub top with egg yolk and
sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Place in greased baking
pans. Let rise once more, uncovered, in a warm place,
approximately 1 hour.

Bake in preheated oven at 375 F for 45 minutes.
Remove from oven; allow to cool 10 minutes before
removing bread from pan.

To Shape Traditional KOULOURA:  Divide dough into 3
long ropes.  Braid together.  Place braid in a greased
tube pan or a large round baking pan. Stretch dough to
make ends meet.  Use egg yolk to stick ends together.

To Shape KOULOURAKIA Rolls:  Pinch off pieces of
dough.  Roll on board with the palms of your hands to
make a rope 6" long.  Twist it into a hairpin, coil
the ends around each other and stick the tips together
with a dab of egg yolk.  Or coil it like a snake,
round and round; or roll into small round balls using
the palms of your hands.  Do not flatten or press down
as you roll.

1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 cup water
1 tablespoon egg replacer
1 cup soymilk or lowfat milk
2 tablespoon canola oil
1/4 cup olive oil or melted ghee
2  garlic cloves; minced

Combine flour, baking soda, cream of tartar and salt. Set aside.

Whisk water and egg replacer.

Mix egg replacer, soy milk and canola oil in a large bowl.

Lorraine's Dinner Or Cinnamon Rolls

breads, rolls

      ----ROLLS----
3  eggs
1 cup boiling water
3/4 cup shortening
3/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon salt
2  envelopes dry yeast,  dissolved in; 1/2 cup  lukewarm water
1 cup lukewarm water
8 cup flour
1/2 cup melted butter
1 cup sugar, *combined with*
1 tablespoon cinnamon (optional)
1 cup raisins
1  glaze (recipe follows)
      ----GLAZE----
1 lb confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 lb butter, softened

Beat eggs until frothy; set aside.  In large bowl, add boiling water
to shortening, sugar and salt.  Add 1 cup lukewarm water. In separate
bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup lukewarm water. When first mixture is
lukewarm, add yeast mixture.  Add flour until batter is beatable,
then keep adding until you can barely handle sticky dough. Knead
lightly to mix. Dough should be slightly sticky.  Put in well-greased
bowl and cover loosely. Place in warm area to rise.  When dough has
doubled in size and is very light, punch down and divide into 4 equal
pieces. I usually make a half-batch of each kind.  To make crescent
rolls, roll each piece to 10 inches in diameter.  Cut into 12
pie-shaped pieces. Brush pieces with melted butter and roll up
tightly, beginning at wide end. Seal points firmly.  Place on greased
baking sheets, about 1 inch apart with points tucked under.  Let rise
until doubled in bulk. Bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes. While
still warm, brush with melted butter. To make cinnamon rolls, brush 4
pieces of dough with melted butter, then sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar
mixture and raisins. Roll up jellyroll-style and cut each into 12
pieces. Bake at 375 for 20 minutes. Glaze rolls while still hot.
Makes 48 rolls. GLAZE: Combine ingredients and beat until smooth and
pretty thin. Spread over hot rolls.

Maggie Murphy's Pot Oven Bread

breads, rolls, irish

1  whole meal irish soda bread

Down yonder in one of our big fields is a lovely mysterious ruin
of an old house and grist mill--moss covered stone walls, roof fallen
in over a perfectly arched stone doorway--and at one end of this
relic is a tiny two-room cottage that was once the miller's cottage.
There, almost forescore years ago, Maggie Murphy first saw the light
of day, and there she will live out all the days that are left her.
Spry as a cricket, she bicycles the five miles into the village once
a week and peddles back (uphill most of the way) with whole-wheat
flour among her purchases. She cooks over an open hearth fire and
mixes her soda bread just as in the recipe for Whole Meal Irish Soda
Bread, but she has no oven--just a three-legged iron pot oven. She
sets this right in the red-hot coals on her hearth, rubs it inside
with a bit of fat pork, drops her cake of whole-wheat dough into it,
puts on the cover and then shovels some of the red coals onto the
cover. Heat top and bottom she has, and the bread bakes for an hour
while she sits by the hearth, from time to time turning the handle on
her wheel bellows--which makes a draft of air come up through the
tiny hole under the coals, bring them to life with a golden glow. At
just the right minute she brushes the hot coals off the cover, lowers
the crane to catch the handle of the pot and swings it away from the
fire.
Out comes a perfectly baked, crusty loaf, fragrant and golden
"and good enough for the likes of me," says my dear friend, Maggie
Murphy. SOURCE: Pepperidge Farm Cookbook From the cookbook files of:

Melt-In-Your-Mouth Rolls

breads, rolls

2 cup milk
1/4 cup sugar
2 pkg active dry yeast; or
1/4 cup luke-warm water; (110 deg.f)
2 each eggs; lg
1/4 cup shortening
2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon active dry yeast; bulk
7 cup unbleached flour; sifted

Scald the milk in a saucepan.  Pour over the shortening, sugar and
salt in a large mixing bowl. Cool to lukewarm. Sprinkle the yeast
over the lukewarm water and stir to dissolve.  Add the yeast mixture,
3 cups of the flour, and eggs to the milk mixture. Beat, using an
electric mixer set on medium speed, for about 2 minutes.  Gradually
stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough.  Turn the
dough out on a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and
satiny, about 8 to 10 minutes. Place the dough in a greased bowl,
turning once to grease the top and cover. Let rise in a warm place
until double, about 1 hour. Punch the dough down and divide the dough
into thirds, then let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Divide each
third into 12 pieces and shape each piece into a ball. Place 12
balls, equally spaced, in a greased 9-inch round cake pan. Repeat for
the remaining two thirds. Cover and let rise until doubled, 45 to 60
minutes. Bake in a preheated 400 degree F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes
or until golden brown.  Remove from the pans and cool on wire racks.

Mom's Cinnamon Rolls

breads, rolls

12 cup flour, all purpose
3/4 cup margarine
3 cup water
1 cup sugar
3 pkg yeast
1 1/2 tablespoon salt
3  eggs
1  brown sugar
2  sticks of butter

These rolls have alot of layers due to how thin the dough is rolled
out. Mrs. Schmidt says that beating the ingredients a real lot is
what makes this come out well. There is also a trick to getting the
sprinkled water just right, just a few drops, here and there.

Sprinkle yeast in 3 cups of warm water with 1 tbsp. sugar, mix and
let sit 10 min.  Add 3 cups of flour and beat well with beater. Let
rise until spongy (30 min.)

Beat 3 eggs really well, 5 minutes (Frothy & Fluffy). Soften
margarine and add 1 cup sugar and beat really, really well till very
creamy. Add to eggs and beat till very well blended and add salt.

Add egg mixture to sponge mixture.  Add approximately four to 5 cups
flour and beat with a beater really well till smooth. Continue adding
flour until smooth to stir put the rest of the flour on a board and
put the dough in the middle and knead. (You don't have to knead in
all the flour-only until not sticky and easy to handle.

Put the dough in a warm oven and cover with a damp cloth. Let rise
until doubled (about 1 hour.)

Fix pans for Rolls.  Grease 2 large rectangular baking pans with
margarine. Sprinkle liberally (not packed) (1/4" deep) with brown
sugar and dot liberally with butter (1 stick per pan) Sprinkle very
lightly with water to keep the sugar from burning and sticking.

Punch down dough and let rise 1/2 hour more.  Turn out and take 1/2
of the dough and roll out to 1/2" thick rectangle.

Spread with soft butter (over all of rectangle) and sprinkle with
sugar and cinnamon.  Roll up jelly roll style, pulling to stretch
dough while rolling.  Cut roll into 1" thick slices. Place in
pan-just touching (don't crowd)  let rise (covered with a damp cloth)
until above the pans. Bake at 325-350 for 20-25 min.

beat in 1 cup of unsifted flour at high speed.  Beat for 2 minutes,
scraping the bowl occasionally.  Mix in enough additional flour (1/2

sticky.)  Put the dough into a greased deep bowl. Cover with waxed
paper and a clean towel and let stand in a warm place until the dough
has doubled, 45 to 60 minutes.  Generously grease several baking
sheets.  Melt the butter and set aside.  Punch the dough down wit a
fist and turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Divide
the dough into two equal portions.  Set one portion aside.  Roll the
dough into a rectangle 16 X 8-inches.  Brush with about one-half of
the melted butter.  Sprinkle with about one half of the grated
cheddar cheese.  Cut crosswise into 8 equal portions.  Cut into
halves lengthwise.  Fold each strip into thirds, lapping each side
portion over the center third.  Place the rolls on a baking sheet.
Repeat for the other half of the dough. Beat the egg yolk with the
tbls of milk, slightly.  Brush the tops of the rolls with the egg
yolk mixture.  Let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes.  Bake at 425
degrees F. for about 8 minutes or until rolls are golden brown.

Oat Farls

breads, rolls, irish

2 cup rolled oats; (not instant)
2 1/4 cup buttermilk
2 1/2 cup unbleached flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda

Recipe by: From Celtic Hearths The day before serving, mix the oats
with 1-1/4 cups of the buttermilk in a bowl. Cover and let stand
overnight at room temperature. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly
grease a baking sheet and set aside. Sift together the flour, salt
and baking soda. Gradually beat the flour mixture into the
oat-buttermilk mixture, adding remaining buttermilk as you work, to
form a soft dough. You may not need to use the full 2-1/4 cups
buttermilk. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and flatten with
hands or floured rolling pin so that it forms a circle about 1 inch
thick and 9 to 10-inches in diameter. With a sharp knife, cut into
quarters or eighths, as desired, and place on prepared baking sheet.
Bake for 40 minutes, or until browned. Serve warm. Note: These are
high in fiber and low in fat, provided you don't slather th with
butter. Delicious with jam or marmalade. Yield: 8 servings.

Old-Fashioned Potato Pan Rolls

breads, rolls

3 3/4 cup all-purpose flour, or bread
1 pkg active dry yeast
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoon cold butter or margarine; cut into chunks
1/2 cup freshly mashed potatoes
3/4 cup milk
1  egg
1  butter; melted


1. In a food processor fitted with a steel blade, process 3-1/4 cups
flour, the yeast, sugar, and salt just to blend. With on/off pulsing,
cut in butter finely, until it almost disappears.

2. In a separate bowl, mix together mashed potato, milk, and egg. With
processor motor running, quickly add potato mixture to yeast mixture.
Process until mixture comes away from the side of the bowl.

3. Process 30 seconds to knead dough. If dough is sticky, add more
flour and process 15 to 30 seconds longer. Dough should feel tacky,
smooth, elastic, and warm but not hot.

4. Remove dough from processor and shape into a ball. Place ball in an
oiled bowl, turn to cover it with oil, and cover bowl with plastic
wrap or a damp towel. Let dough rise until doubled in bulk.

5. Punch dough down. Let rest 5 minutes. Divide dough into 24 pieces
(approximately 1-1/4 ounces each). Shape each piece into a ball,
tucking the edges under to draw the surface of the dough tight.
Arrange the dough in 2 round cake or pie pans. Cover loosely with
plastic wrap or a damp towel and let rise until doubled in bulk.

6. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Brush tops with melted butter. Bake
until golden brown (20 to 30 minutes). Remove from pan to cool on a
wire rack. Brush tops again with melted butter.

Makes 2 dozen rolls.

breads, rolls

      ----SWEET DOUGH----
2 pkg dry yeast
1/2 cup warm milk
3/4 cup milk
1/2 cup sugar
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter
2  eggs; beaten
4 cup flour
2 tablespoon butter; very soft
      ----STICKY SYRUP----
1 cup water
1/2 cup butter
1  grated zest from 1 orange
1 cup orange juice
2 cup sugar
      ----TO ASSEMBLE----
1 cup raisins
1 cup water
4 tablespoon butter; very soft
1 tablespoon cinnamon
1 tablespoon sugar
1 cup pecans; coarsely chopped
      ----STICKY BUN GLAZE----
1 cup powdered sugar
2 tablespoon cream or milk

FOR DOUGH: In a small bowl, stir the yeast with the warm water. Set
aside until bubbly.

Heat milk, sugar, salt, and butter together until butter melts. Pour
into a large bowl to cool to lukewarm. Add yeast to the cooled milk
mixture. Add eggs and 2 cups of the flour and beat well by hand,
about 2 minutes. Add the remaining 2 cups flour, one cup at a time,
beating well until soft and smooth and should pull cleanly away from
the sides of the bowl.

Turn into a buttered bowl, then generously butter the surface of the
dough with the softened butter, top and bottom. Cover with plastic
wrap. Refrigerate as little as 2 hours, or overnight, or up to 3
days. Dough will rise in refrigerator. It will be ready for rolling
and shaping the next morning.

FOR SYRUP: Bring water, butter, orange zest, orange juice, and sugar
to a boil and simmer 10 minutes.

TO ASSEMBLE BUNS: Simmer raisins in water for 10 minutes, then drain.
Grease 2 9-inch round cake pans. Pour syrup equally into pans.

Mix 1 tablespoon sugar with 1 tablespoon cinnamon.

Set our 4 small bowls to hold an assembly line of the softened butter,
sugar-cinnamon mixture, pecans, and drained raisins.

Divide dough in half. Place first section on a surface lightly
sprinkled with flour and roll it into a 10- by 12-inch rectangle.
Spread surface with half the butter, then sprinkle with half the
cinnamon-sugar, pecans, and raisins. Roll up from long side into a
snug log. With a sharp knife, cut into 8 sections. Place spirals, cut
sides down, into the syrup in one of the pans, placing 1 spiral in
the center and 7 around. Repeat with remaining dough and second pan.

Cover buns with a cloth and let rise 1 hour. After 40 minutes,
preheat oven to 375'F.

Bake buns 25 to 30 minutes. Remove and immediately invert onto a rack
with waxed paper underneath to catch drips. Let cool 10 minutes
before icing with the glaze.

FOR THE GLAZE: Do not mix until ready to use. With a fork, mix sugar
and cream until smooth. Pour over buns.

Part-Baked Rolls & Loaves

breads, rolls

1  rolls

Both home-baked white and wheatmeal rolls can be frozen partly baked.
This is a very successful way of freezing rolls as the frozen rolls
can be put straight from the freezer into the oven to finish baking.
It is the best method of freezing rolls to serve for breakfast.
Loaves are not so successful as rolls because during part-baking the
crust becomes well formed and colored before the center of the loaf
is set. Part-baked loaves and rolls available in shops freeze well.

TO PART-BAKE ROLLS:

Place shaped and risen rolls in a slow oven, Gas No. 2 (300 degrees
F/150 degrees C), for about 20 minutes. The rolls must be set but
still pale in color. Cool.

TO FREEZE:

Pack cooled rolls in usable quantities in freezer bags. Seal and
freeze. As the sides of the rolls are still slightly soft, care must
be taken when packing to avoid squashing.

STORAGE TIME:

Up to 4 months.

TO THAW AND FINISH BAKING:

Unwrap and place frozen rolls in oven to thaw and complete baking.
Bake white rolls at Gas No. 6 (400 degrees F/200 degrees C), brown
rolls at Gas No. 8 (450 degrees F/230 degrees C) for 20 minutes.
Alternatively, to defrost the loaf in the microwave, stand uncovered
on paper towel and heat on defrost for 2 minutes, then leave for 5
minutes. Slice and leave for 1-2 minutes, until completely defrosted.
The remainder of the loaf can be refrozen.

TO FREEZE:

Freeze immediately after purchasing. Leave loaves in polythene bags in
which they were sold. Pack rolls in polythene bags and seal.

STORAGE TIME:

Up to 4 months.

Note: Many commercial part-baked rolls and bread can be stored at room
temperature. Follow instructions on the pack.

Passover Rolls

breads, rolls, jewish

2 cup matzah meal
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1 cup water
1/2 cup peanut oil
4  eggs

Combine matzah meal with salt and sugar.  In a medium saucepan, bring oil
and water to a boil. Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the matzah
meal, mixing well.

Beat in the eggs thoroughly, one at a time (this is where it starts to get
sticky).  Let the mixture stand for about 15 minutes (can be refrigerated).

With well-oiled hands, shape it into rolls and place on a well-greased
cookie sheet (you will have to keep re-oiling your hands). Bake in a
preheated 375 degree F. oven for 50 minutes or until golden brown.

NOTES:

*  Bread-like Passover rolls -- This recipe comes from a poster-sized sheet
of recipes printed by Manischewitz many years ago (probably before I was
born). Besides making reasonably good mock "rolls," it's also great fun for
kids to make (very sticky!).

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  35 minutes preparation (including waiting), 50 minutes baking.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

Potato Pan Rolls

breads, rolls, potatoes

1  (4-5 ounce) all-purpose potato
1  envelope active dry yeast
1 tablespoon plus 1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar
2 tablespoon warm water
1 cup milk
1 1/4 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoon butter
3 1/4  to 3-1/2 cups unbleached or all-pur; pose flour
1  egg, slightly beaten
4 tablespoon butter, melted, for brushing on the; rolls

Info:  posted by Perry Lowell, GOURMET/INTERCOOK, March '93 from
"Sunday Suppers, Informal American Home Cooking", 1988 by Melanie
Barnard & Brooke Dojny

The potato in these rolls helps produce a smooth-textured grain and
somehow adds a certain subtle tang to their taste. In other words,
they taste so good that they're worth the effort --- especially if
you are also yearning for the smell of bread baking in your kitchen.

These rolls freeze very well after baking.  Wrap them in foil to
reheat. Quick-rise yeast may be substituted. Rising times will be
about half as long.

Makes 24 rolls.

1.  Peel the potato and cook it in a small saucepan of boiling water
until tender.  Drain, discard the water, and mash with a fork. You
should have about 1/2 cup of mashed potato.

2.  Dissolve the yeast with 1/4 teaspoon of the sugar in the 2
Tablespoons warm water and set aside until the yeast is bubbly, about
5 minutes.

3.  Heat the milk with the remaining Tablespoon of sugar and the salt.
Remove from the heat, add the butter, and stir until melted. Stir in
the mashed potatoes.

4.  Place 3 cups of flour in a large mixing bowl and add the milk
mixture, the yeast mixture, and the egg. Stir to combine well. Knead
on a well-floured board or with a dough hook in a heavy-duty mixer
until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.  Add enough
additional flour to make a smooth, workable dough.

5.  Transfer the dough to a greased bowl, cover, and let rise in a
warm place until doubled in bulk, about
1-1/2    hours.

6.  Punch the dough down.  Lightly butter two 8- or 9-inch round cake
pans. Divide the dough into 24 equal pieces and shape each piece into
a round ball. Arrange the balls of dough in the cake pans side by
side, leaving about 1/4-inch between each roll.  Brush the rolls with
some of the melted butter.  Let rise for 30 minutes at room
temperature before baking, or cover loosely with plastic wrap and let
rise in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight.

7.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Brush the rolls again with the
remaining melted butter and bake in the preheated oven until a
beautiful golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. Serve hot.

Potato Supper Rolls

breads, rolls

1 medium baking potato, peeled and cut into; 1-1/2-inch pieces
1 cup skim milk
1 pkg dry yeast
3 3/4 cup bread flour, divided
2 tablespoon sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon margarine, softened
1  egg, lightly beaten
1  vegetable cooking spray

Directions: Place potato in a small saucepan; cover with water, and
bring to a boil.

Reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, 15 minutes or until very tender;
drain. Press potato through a sieve into a bowl. Set aside 1/2 cup
potato, and discard remaining potato.

Heat milk over medium-high heat in a heavy saucepan to 180 deg or
until tiny bubbles form around edge. (Do not boil.) Remove from heat;
let cool until very warm (120-130 degrees).

Combine yeast, 1 cup flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl; stir
well. Add 1/2 cup potato, very warm milk, margarine, and egg; beat at
medium speed of an electric mixer until smooth. Add 1 cup flour; beat
until smooth. Stir in 1-1/4 cups flour to form a soft dough. Turn
dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough until smooth
and elastic (about 10 minutes); add enough of remaining flour, 1
tablespoon at a time, to prevent dough from sticking to hands.

Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to
coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from
drafts, 45 minutes or until doubled in bulk.

Punch dough down, and turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface;
knead lightly 4 or 5 times. Divide dough in half; cut each half into
8 equal portions, shaping each piece into a ball with lightly floured
hands. (Cover remaining dough while working to prevent it from drying
out.) Place balls 3 inches apart on baking sheets coated with cooking
spray. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from
drafts, 25 minutes or until doubled in bulk.

Uncover dough. Bake at 325 degrees for 23 minutes or until lightly

Puccia (Olive Studded Rolls)

breads, rolls, italian, bakery

1 1/4 teaspoon dried yeast
1/3 cup warm water
3 cup water at room temperature
1 cup biga pugliese
5 1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 cup whole-wheat flour
1 tablespoon salt
4 1/3 oz small, meaty black olives in - wate; r or brine, pitted
1  cornmeal

Stir the yeast into the warm water in a large bowl or heavy mixer. Let
proof for 10 minutes.  Add the remaining water & the biga & mix until
well blended. Add the flours & mix until the dough comes together, 1
to 2 minutes, although it will not come away from the sides of the
bowl. With very wet hands, knead until the dough is very silky, soft
& elasticy. Knead on a lightly floured board to eliminate the
stickiness. Knead in the olives by hand to ensure that they remain
whole. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl & let rise, covered, until
tripled, 3 to 4 hours. Pour the wet dough out of the bowl onto a
floured work surface. Do not punch it down. Flour the top & divide
into 12 pieces (or 16 if you want smaller rolls). Have a bowl of
water handy to keep your hands very wet. Flatten each piece & roll it
up lengthwise.  Pat them flat, turn the dough 90 degrees & roll them
up again.  Shape each piece into a ball. Set on a floured baking
sheet. Toss a hailstorm of flour over the tops & cover with a heavy
cloth. Leave until doubled, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Preheat the oven to
425F. Bake the rolls until they are crusty & golden, about 25 to 30
minutes. VARIATIONS: Puccia di Grano Duro.  Substitute 7 1/2 c durum
flour for the flours above. Knead the dough for an extra two minutes.
Puccia di Uva Passa. Use raisins, softened in water for 30 minutes,
in place of the olives. Pizzi. Add 1/4 ts to 3/8 ts hot pepper flakes
to the vegetables of Cucuzzara (see recipe) & folding them into the
dough in place of the olives.

2 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup canned pumpkin or mashed cooked pum; pkin
2 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1  egg, beaten,
1  package dry yeast
1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 cup bread flour
1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
1  top. ground cinnamon
2 tablespoon melted butter

Here's an Amish recipe that might come in handy if you got a bunch of
punkin' stuff laying around.  The date on this is 10/12/88. That's
right++'88!  I've had this pile of papers for a *long* time...

In small saucepan, heat milk and 2 Tbs. butter just until warm (120F
to 130F) and butter is almost melted, stirring constantly.

In large mixer bowl, combine pumpkin, sugar and salt. Add milk
mixture and beat with electric mixer until well mixed. Beat in egg
and yeast.

In separate mixing bowl, combine flours.  Add half of flour mixture to
pumpkin mixture.  Beat mixture on low speed for 5 minutes, scraping
sides of bowl frequently. Add remaining flour and mix thoroughly
(dough will be very soft).  Turn into lightly greased bowl then
grease surface of dough lightly.  Cover and let rise in warm place
until doubled, about 1 hour.

Punch dough down.  Turn onto floured surface.  Knead a few turns to
form a smooth dough, sprinkling with enough additional flour to make
dough easy to handle. On lightly floured surface, roll dough into 12-
by 10-inch rectangle.

In small bowl, combine brown sugar and cinnamon. Brush surface of
dough with melted butter.  Sprinkle with brown sugar mixture.
Beginning with long side of dough, roll up jelly-roll style. Pinch
seam to seal.

With sharp knife, cut roll into twelve 1-inch slices. Place rolls,
cut side up, in greased 9-inch square baking pan. Cover and let rise
until nearly doubled, 30 to 45 minutes,

Bake rolls at 350F for about 20 minutes or until golden.

Remove from pan to waxed paper-lined wire rack.  Cool for 10 to 15
minutes.

Makes 12 rolls.

Quick Cinnamon Rolls

breads, rolls, microwave

1 cup water
1 cup milk
1/2 cup butter
6 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
2  envelopes instant yeast
1  large egg
4 tablespoon butter
4 tablespoon brown sugar
2 tablespoon honey
1/4 cup butter, softened

Combine water, milk and butter in a bowl and microwave on full power
for 90 seconds to 2 minutes (120 to 125 degrees F on candy
thermometer). Combine 2 cups flour, sugar, salt and yeast in food
procesor or mixer and process or mix for 10 seconds to mix well. With
processor or mixer running, pour the warm liquid into the flour, add
the egg and process for 20 seconds. Stop processor and add 2 1/2 cups
of flour, process 40 seconds. If using mixer, switch to dough hook
and mix for 2 minutes. Turn sticky dough onto floured board.
Gradually add enough of the rest of the flour and knead only until
the dough is not sticky but is still soft. Cover with a mixing bowl
and let rest 15 minutes. It should be bubbling happily by then.
Generously grease 2 8 inch square or round pans. Melt 2 Tablespoons
of butter in each pan and add 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar and 1
Tablespoon of honey. Sprinkle cinnamon over butter mixture. Divide
the dough in half. Roll 1 half into a 10 x 20 inch rectangle on a
floured board. Brush with the softened butter and spread with
cinnamon and brown sugar. Roll up like a jelly roll stretch slightly
by pulling on the ends to even thickness. Press lightly along edge to
seal. Using a floured knife, cut into rolls. Place in prepared pan
with cut sides down. Repeat with other half. Cover with clean
tea-towel and place in an unheated oven with a pan of hot water on
the bottom rack. Let rise for 40 minutes. Before baking, remove pan
of water and rolls. Heat oven to 375 F. Bake rolls for 20 to 25
minutes or until just golden brown. Turn out onto tray or piece of
waxed paper. Tips: Use a candy thermometer to check temperature of
water. May be proofed in the microwave on low for 10 minutes instead
of in regular oven. Let dough rest for 15 minutes before baking. A
1000 watt microwave was used, times may need to be adjusted.
Sometimes, 40 minutes rising is too long, if the dough starts to look
like it is going to overflow then cook it right away. Nuts, raisins
or cherries may be added either to the pan or spread over the dough
before rolling.

Red Lobster Cheese Rolls

breads, rolls

1 teaspoon garlic salt or powder
1 tablespoon parsley flakes
1 teaspoon italian seasonings
5 lb bisquick
44 oz cold water
1 lb cheddar cheese, sharp,grated
1/2 cup butter or margarine

Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mix bisquick, water and cheese. Drop by
large spoonfuls onto greased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes.
After baking, (while hot) brush on melted butter or margarine mixed
with garlic powder, parsley flakes and italian seasoning. (Amounts
will vary by the size batch you make, but a little goes a long way.)
Serve hot.

The Red Lobster manager's recipe is for a large quantity, so you'll
have to reduce the ingredient quantities by the size batch you
desire. Note: For a smaller batch I usually use 2 C. Bisquick, 1/2
cup cold water, and 3/4 c. grated cheddar which will yield about 12
biscuits.

You may also substitute soda water or gingerale for the water, if
desired.

Red Lobster Cheese Rolls   Small Recipe

breads, rolls, quick&easy

1  garlic salt -- or powder
1  parsley flakes
1  italian seasonings
2 cup bisquick
1/2 cup cold water -- scant cup
3 oz sharp cheddar cheese --
1  grated
1 oz butter -- or margarine

My Notes: When the Red Lobster restaurant that we go to started
serving their cheese rolls, I managed to talk the manager out of this
recipe. It's been posted numerous times since 3/90 by me and by
Elaine Radis and others. The quantities I've given are as the manager
gave me. Later, I cut the ingredient quantities down to be more
useable by the average family. These do freeze, however, so it's
worthwhile making the larger batch and freezing the ones you do not
plan to use immediately.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mix bisquick, water and cheese. Drop by
large spoonfuls onto greased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes.
After baking, (while hot) brush on melted butter or margarine mixed
with garlic powder, parsley flakes and Italian seasoning. (Amounts
will vary by the size batch you make, but a little goes a long way.)
Serve hot. The RL manager's recipe is for a large quantity, so you'll
have to reduce the ingredient quantities by the size batch you desire.

NOTE: this recipe has already been reduced.

Red Lobster Garlic Cheese Rolls

breads, rolls

16 oz very finely shredded cheddar cheese
6 cup water
5 lb box of bisquick mix garlic butter,; soft or melted

Mix together cheese, water and Bisquick in a large bowl. Drop onto a
non-stick cookie sheet or one that is covered with aluminum foil. You
will need to experiment with size but they should turn out to be
about the size of a normal biscuit (about 2" in diameter??). Bake at
400 degrees until golden (sorry, don't have the cooking time. Perhaps
the Bisquick box can help).  Right after you remove the rolls from
the oven, spread or brush VERY GENEROUSLY with garlic butter (soft or
melted butter with lots of finely diced or crushed garlic mixed in).
Serve rolls warm.

Note:  I have no idea how many rolls this makes so you may want to
cut it down unless you plan on feeding a herd!

Red Lobster's Cheesy Garlic Rolls (Kathy's)

breads, rolls

2 1/2 lb baking mix *
21 oz cold water
6 oz grated mild cheddar cheese

*RL uses a specially made product, but Bisquick buttermilk baking mix
is a decent substitute

Mix together above ingredients (by hand, an electric mixer will NOT
work) until JUST combined --do not overmix. Scoop with a 1 1/2 ounce
scoop onto 2 parchment-lined baking sheets (20 per sheet), and bake
in a 450 convection oven for 4-5 minutes.  Rotate the sheets, and
bake another 4-5 minutes. (Note, a commercial convection oven cooks
about 25 percent faster than a home oven -- for the same results,
increase the baking time somewhat, but be careful not to overbrown
the rolls, they should be a light golden brown).

Remove rolls from the oven, and brush with garlic butter mixture
(again, RL uses a proprietary product, but you can make a decent
imitation by adding garlic powder, NOT salt) to taste, plus some
dehydrated parsley flakes to liquid margarine.  Do not add too much
butter to the rolls, or the garlic flavor will overpower the cheese.

For variations, increase the cheese to 8 oz. (better, and the way the
Lobster used to do it), or substitute about 5 oz. shredded Parmesan
(NOT the dried stuff that comes in a can) for the cheddar. The
Parmesan variation is excellent. IMHO, better than the original. As a
breakfast bread (or snack for the cook), you may also add 4-5 slices
of crisp cooked bacon to this.  In this case, brush with regular
liquid margarine instead of garlic butter.

Note: this is a half recipe for the ones made at the Lobster. It
makes 40 rolls, which is a LOT for home use. You might want to scale
it down somewhat.

Retes Teszeta (Strudel Dough)

breads, rolls, hungarian

2 cup of sifted all-purpose flour
1 each egg
6 each tbps. butter, melted and cooled to; room temperature
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon white vinegar
1/2 cup lukewarm water

Measure the flour into a mixing bowl Make a well in the center and
add the egg, 2 tbsp. of the butter, the salt, the vinegar and 2 tbsp.
of the water into the well. Using your fingers, work these
ingredients together, adding the remainingw ater a little at a time
and kneading until the dough can be worked into a ball. Transfer the
dough to a floured bread board and knead it until it is elastic and
no longer sticky. Throw the dough down on the board a number of times
to soften and then knead vigorously for 20 minutes or until surface
blisters form. Dust with flour, cover with an inverted bowl and let
the dough rest for 45 minutes. Cover an oblong table with a cloth
that will overhang the edge by at least six inches. (an old sheet can
be cut for this purpose). Dust the cloth with flour. Place the dough
in the center of the cloth and brush with a little butter. Working
quickly, roll the dough th 1/2 inch thickness. Bring the ends of the
dough over your hands and lift high off the table, allowing the dough
to stretch by its own weight. Return to counter and stretch it until
it is paper thin and overlaps the edge of the table. Cut off the
thick outer edges. Brush dough generously with melted butter and use
it quickly. Prepare the strudel filling before making the dough so
all is ready. (You can also substitute phyllo dough, available frozen
at the supermarket for a good strudel dough) Retes teszta - Hungarian

Rolled Sugar Cookies (Wedman)

rolls, biscuits

1/2 cup margarine
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1  egg
2 cup flour
2 teaspoon baking powder

Cream together the margarine, sugar, vanilla and egg until light and
fluffy.  Add about 3/4 of the flour and the baking powder, reserving
the rest of the flour for rolling. Blend until well mixed. Chill the
dough for 2 hours or overnight.

Roll out on a lightly floured surface until 1/8 inch thick. Cut with a
cookie cutter.  Place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake in a 375
degree oven until lightly browned, about 5-10 minutes. Cool before
storing. Makes about 72 cookies 2 inch size or 6 small cookie sheets
of various sizes.

My note:  If you aren't too fussy, square or random shapes from the
edges can be cut with a plastic knife or anything that is safe to use
on your rolling surface. Decorate with a tiny piece of a cherry,
raisin or nut.

Tips For Making Yeast Products (Bread~ Rolls~

breads, rolls, misc

1  recipe hint

1. Choose a quick rising dry yeast. This will speed up the dough
making
process. 2. Make sure yeast is fresh. Store in a cool dry place. 3.
Start with all ingredients at room temperature. Cold ingredients will
make rising time very long. 4. Heat milk or water only to proper
temperature (110-115 deg f if
dissolving dry yeast in liquid, or 120-130 deg f if mixing dry
yeast with
flour). 5. Follow one of the mixing methods (premix yeast with
liquid, 1/4 cup
liquid for each 1/4 oz. pkg yeast) or (mix dry yeast with flour and
mix
with liquid). 6. Always check temperature of liquid with
thermometer, bakers who guess
often play it safe and use liquid that is too cool. 7. Choose a warm
place to let yeast products rise. Cover dough and let
rise in oven. (warm oven first by turning it on to lowest
temperature for
one minute. Turn off and place covered dough in warm oven).
*******************************************************
************** *** YEAST BAKING PROBLEMS:: Crust too thick 1. too
much flour 2. insufficient rising 3. oven temperature too low Baked

Toffee Crunch Rolls

breads, rolls, breakfast

1 pkg dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water
1/2 cup buttermilk plus
2 tablespoon buttermilk
1  egg
3 cup flour
1/4 cup butter, softened
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon butter, softened
1/4 cup white sugar
2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup brown sugar not firmly packed
3 tablespoon corn syrup
1/4 cup chopped pecans
1/4 cup blanched almonds, crumbled

1. To pre pare yeast dough: In a large mixing bowl, sprinkle the dry
yeast over the warm water.  Add a pinch of sugar, if desired, to
start the yeast working.  After yeast softens a bit, stir to help
dissolve. After a few more minutes, foam should begin to form.

2.Meanwhile, remove egg from the refrigerator and place in a cup of
hot water.  Let stand while yeast dissolves. measure out flour and
set aside in a smaller bowl. Measure buttermilk and warm in microwave
in glass cup. Stir the foamy yeast mixture with a wooden spoon and
then stir in the warmed buttermilk and egg. Beat lightly to blend.
Stir in 1 1/4 cups of the flour, the 1/4 cup sugar, the baking powder
and salt.

3. Beat at low speed of an electric mixer toblend, scrape bowl and
then beat at medium speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl oc- casionally.
Stir in enough remaining flour to make dough fairly easy to handle,
but still soft and slightly sticky.

4. Without letting the dough rise, immediately roll out to a
rectangle that measures 15x9 inches. Measure to be sure. Spread
surface of dough evenly with 2 tablespoons softened butter. Mix 1/4
cup sugar and 2 teaspoons cinnamon and sprinkle over the butter. Roll
up, starting from the wide side to form a spiral.
Pinch edge of dough to seal. Streth and pat the roll to make it of
even width. Slice into 15 even slices, using a knife, or tie off with
thread.

6. For topping, melt the stick of butter in a 13x9 inch glass baking
pan. Then stir in the brown sugar and corn syrup. Tilt the pan to
evenly distribute.
Sprinkle evenly with the crushed nuts. Place rolls, cut sides down,
slightly apart on top of the nuts in rows of three down and 5 across.
Cover pan with plastic wrap and set in a warm place until the rolls
have doubled in size, about 35 minutes.

7. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350~.  Bake rolls 25 to 30 minutes or
until light golden brown.  Immediately invert pan on a foil- covered
oblong tray and scrape any remaining nut mixture out of pan over
rolls. Cover rolls to protect them from drying while they cool.

1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt

Weggeliteig (Button Rolls)

breads, rolls, swiss

2 cup hot water (120-130f)
1 cup nonfat dry milk
2 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoon salt
5 cup all-purpose or bread flour
2  pkg. dry yeast
2 tablespoon each lard & veg. shortening
1  egg, beaten, mixed with a  pinch of; salt

Grease a large baking sheet (or have ready a Teflon one).

In a large mixing or mixer bowl pour the hot water and add the milk,
sugar, salt and 2 cups flour.  Stir to blend. Add the yeast: stir.
Measure in the shortening.  (The recipe's creator, a Swiss baker,
insists that half of the shortening should be lard if you're
attempting to duplicate the original flavor.) If working by hand,
beat with a wooden spoon: if in a mixer, use the flat beater.  When
the shortening has been blended into the heavy batter, add the
balance of the flour, half a cup at a time, until the dough is a
shaggy mass and can be worked with the hands or under the dough hook.

Knead for 8 minutes by hand or in the mixer, until the dough is soft
and elastic.

Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap,
and set aside until it has doubled in bulk, about 2 hours.

Turn dough from the bowl, and punch down.

Divide the dough into 24 pieces, and roll each into a ball until any
seams disappear.  When each ball is round and cohesive, fashion it
into a long roll - 4 to 5 inches -- by pushing it back and forth
under your flattened palm with considerable pressure.  Place the
rolls end to end on the baking sheet with a three-inch space between
the parallel rows. If there is dough for more rolls than the baking
sheet will accomodate, reserve it and repeat this step when the sheet
and oven are available.

Cover the rolls with wax paper and leave undisturbed for 40 minutes.
Then brush each roll with the egg/salt mixture. Leave uncovered for
another 20 minutes.  At the end of the hour, brush again with the
glaze.

Preheat the oven to 375F.

When the rolls have been brushed for the second time, face the long
side of the rolls.  Hold scissors at a 45-degree angle, and snip 5
triangular cuts across each roll, about 1" long, down the center of
each roll. The points of the cuts will rise, forming "buttons". Dip
the scissors in water frequently so the points don't stick to the
glaze.

When all the rolls have been cut, place the baking sheet on the
center rack of the oven.  Halfway through baking, turn the sheet end
for end to equalize the heat on the rolls. They are done when glossy
brown, 35 minutes.  Turn a roll over and tap the bottom crust to make
sure the crust is firm.

Place on a rack to cool somewhat before serving.

1/2 cup butter
1/3 cup warm (105-115 deg) water
2 pkg active dry yeast
3  eggs (room temperature)  6 cups all; -purpose flour
1  pecan rolls
1  basic sweet dough recipe
1 1/2 cup brown sugar
3/4 cup pure maple syrup
6 tablespoon softened butter
1 cup chopped pecans
4 tablespoon softened butter
1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon cinnamon

QUICK SWEET DOUGH:

Scald milk; stir in sugar, salt and butter.  Cool to lukewarm.
Pour warm water into warmed bowl.  Sprinkle in yeast and stir
until dissolved. Add lukewarm milk mixture, eggs and 5 cups of
the flour.  Mix with dough hooks or by hand until well blended,
about 3 minutes.  Add remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time as
needed.  Knead until smooth and elastic.  Place dough in a
greased bowl, turning to grease top.  Cover and let rise in a
warm place free from draft until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Punch down and divide dough for rolls or coffee cakes as desired.

YUMMY PECAN ROLLS:

Combine brown sugar, syrup, and butter in saucepan and heat until
sugar is dissolved.  Bring to a rolling boil for 1 minute.  Pour
into two 11" X 7" X 1 1/2" pans.  Sprinkle with pecans.  On a
lightly floured board divide  dough in half.  Roll each section
into a 12" X 9" rectangle.  Combine  cinnamon and sugar together.
Brush dough with butter and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar
mixture.   Roll up tightly, jelly roll style, beginning with long
side.  Seal by pinching ends.  Cut each roll into 12 1-inch
slices.*   Place cut-side down over pecan-syrup mixture.  Cover
and allow to rise in a warm place until almost doubled, about 30
minutes.   Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 25 minutes.

Turn out onto 2 large platters.

* This actually makes 24 rolls.  I cut them a lot thinner and
wind up with about 36 to 48 smaller rolls.   It depends on what
you serve them with!
