  edges as before, and brown them for 1-to-1 1/2 minutes per side. Drain them
  on paper towels, then keep them warm on an uncovered platter in a 250F
  oven. Fry the rest of the pancakes, adding more vegetable oil to the
  skillet if needed. Serve the pancakes hot with the dipping sauce.

           -Marjoram
           Freshly milled pepper
 
  WASH THE SLICED LEEKS really well, as they are always sandy. Trim the
  artichokes. (See instructions in the recipe "Artichokes and Peas.") Keep
  the finished pieces in a bowl covered with water and the juice of one
  lemon. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add the fava beans, and cook
  for about a minute. Scoop them out and put them in a bowl of cold water,
  reserving the cooking water. Slip each bean out of its skin and set aside.
  Cut the top 3 inches off the asparagus. (Save the stalks for soup.) If the
  tips are very thick, slice them in half lengthwise. Warm the butter and
  olive oil in a wide skillet and add the leeks, artichokes, garlic, and salt
  lightly. Toss to coat everything with the oil and squeeze the juice of the
  second lemon over all. Cook gently for several minutes, without frying,
  then add the water. Simmer, partially covered, for about 15 minutes or
  until the artichokes are tender but still a little firm. Make sure there is
  always some liquid in the pan, adding more water as needed in small
  increments. Return the water used for the fava beans to the heat and bring
  to a boil. Separately blanch the turnips, carrots and asparagus and add
  them to the stewed vegetables along with the fresh peas. (If you're using
  frozen peas, add them during the last 2 minutes or so.) Cook gently until
  all the vegetables are tender and the liquid is reduced to a syrup. Taste
  for salt. Stir in the additional butter and the herbs and season with
  pepper.

  crab claws in decorative arrangement around the casserole.  Cut 1 pimiento
  in strips and place over the rice.  Fill the remaining pimiento with peas

  parsley bouquets here and there for color.  Sprinkle all with dry sherry
  and return to oven uncovered for 5 minutes longer. Remove from oven and let
  stand for at least 15 minutes before serving. NOTE: In many parts of Spain,

      Title: TULIP, CRAB, AND ASPARAGUS APPETIZERS
 Categories: Appetizers, Seafood, Flowers
      Yield: 25 servings
 
      3 oz Cream cheese; softened
      2 ts Lemon juice
      1 tb Minced chives
      1 ts Minced fresh dill or mint
           -(Optional)
      1 ds Pepper or cayenne
      1 c  Crab meat, flaked
     25    Fresh asparagus spears
     25    Tulip petals
 
  In a medium bowl, beat cheese with lemon juice, herbs, and pepper; stir in
  crab.
  Break tough ends off asparagus.  Blanch in 1 inch of boiling water in a
  large skillet with a lid, or steam standing upright in a couple of inches
  of water in a tall, narrow pot, until crisp-tender, 2 to 5 minutes,
  depending on thickness of stems.  Plunge into an ice-water bath for 1
  minute; then pat dry.  Trim asparagus to abut 5 inches; from the
  trimmings, cut as many 1/4-inch rounds as you have tulip petals.  Save
  extra ends for salads.
  Fill each tulip petal with about 1/2 a rounded teaspoon of crab mixture
  and garnish with an asparagus round.  (If your petals are large and
  asparagus thin, you can use 3 rounds to garnish each filled petal.)
  Arrange asparagus in a fan on a serving platter and place tulip petals
  alternately (or create your own pattern).

----------------------------------OPTIONAL----------------------------------
    1/4 ts Sea salt; especially if
           -unsalted vegetable bouillon
           -is used
    1/2 c  Almonds; roasted at home
           -chopped
 
  * to cook millet, use 2 1/2 cups water per 1 cup dry millet. It does not
  usually need prewashing. Cook 40-55 minutes and use as a substitute for
  rice  in rice dishes. This is one of the best grains, high in vitamins and
  very alkaline.
  
  Mix cooked millet, hazelnut flour (or ground nuts) and arrowroot powder (or
  substitute flours) together. Heat the oil and saute the onions, brocolli
  and carrots until semi-tender. Add the other vegetables and saute another
  1-2 minutes more. Break up the bouillon cubes in the stir fry and mix them
  well with everything else. Remove the saute from heat and mix it well with
  the millet-flour mixture. Roll it into balls, using 1/8 - 1/4 cup for each
  ball. Bake the balls at 400F for 18-22 minutes until hot and toasted for a
  wonderful flavour.
  
  Serve with Arrowroot sauce, Mushroom Gravy, Vegetarian Gravy or Toasted
  Cashew or Sesame Sauce. Incredibly delicious!
  
  The 1/8 cup balls may be stir fried in a lightly oiled frying pan and
  served as "meat balls" with spaghetti and tomato sauce or they may be eaten
  plain or serve as suggested above. Cold leftover balls keep 4-6 days
  refrigerated. They are terrific for lunches and snacks - a wonderful
  protein  and vitamin lift. MAKES: 2-4 dozen
  
  VARIATIONS: Rice or Quinoa Vegetable Balls: Instead of millet, brown rice
  may be used. Cook 7/8 cup rice in 2 1/4 cups water so that the rice is very
  tender. For Quinoa Vegetable Balls, cook 1 1/8 cups quinoa in only 2 cups
  water so that the grain will be less tender than usual. Measure 2 cups of
  the cold cooked grain before using in the recipe. Other grains may also be
  used. Experiment with kasha, buckwheat, pot barley, bulgur or other whole
  grains.
  
  Millet, Rice or Quinoa Vegetable Burgers Prepare the Wonderful Millet
  Vegetable Balls (or the grain you are using as above) and use 1/2 to 3/4
  cup of mixture for each burger. Lightly coat the burger with whole wheat,
  kamut or spelt flour. Grill them for 4-5 minutes on each side on
  medium-high heat in a skillet or on a griddle. serve with natural ketchup,
  mustard, pickle and a bun if desired.
  
  Tofu Vegetable balls or Burgers Prepare the Wonderful Millet Vegetables
  (above) except use 1 lb of regular tofu, crumbled instead of the millet.
  
  T.V.P. Vegetable Balls or Burgers Prepare the Wonderful Millet Vegetable
  Balls (above) but in place of the millet use 1 cup texturized vegetable
  protein (T.V.P.) or texturized soy protein soaked in 7/8 cup boiling water
  for 10 minutes or until the T.V.P. expands and softens.

 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      2 tb Sesame oil
    1/4 lb Broccoli florets
     12    Asparagus tips
      2    Carrots, julienned
      1 sm Zucchini, cut into wheels
    1/4 lb Snow peas
      1 md Red pepper, julienned
      1 md Green pepper, julienned
      1 lb Tofu, cut into thin strips
      2    Scallions, chopped
           Tamari or soy sauce to taste
 
  Thom Christopher may have walked away with an Emmy for his role as drug
  kingpin Carlo Hesser on ONE LIFE TO LIVE, but he says his mother, Nancy,
  swept the awards when it came to talent in the kitchen. "My mother was the
  most incredible Italian cook," recalls Christopher (who was transformed
  into jewel expert Mortimer Bern on the ABC show after his character Carlo
  was murdered). "What's always fascinated me about my mom is that she could
  work and come home and unexpectedly make meals for 20 people and upward."
  Which is exactly what she did one evening in 1961 for Christopher and a
  group of actors who had been rehearsing all afternoon: "Everyone said,
  'What are we going to do with a party of 24?' I called home and said, 'Mom,
  I'd like to bring the company home for dinner', and she said, 'How many?' I
  said, 'About 24.' By the time we got home, she had made chicken with tomato
  sauce, shells in tomato sauce, stuffed braciola, chicken soup with
  escarole. To this day, we all remember that awesome meal."
  
  Christopher's mom passed on her passion for cooking. The actor now enjoys
  his own elaborate dinner parties with his wife, Judy, in their Manhattan
  town house. Judy creates the entrees while Christopher whips up the
  appetizers and desserts - from tuna-fish specialties to banana trifle.
  
  His recipe for sauteed tofu and vegetables - which can be served as an
  appetizer or a side dish - reflects his cooking philosophy. "I believe in
  economy in the kitchen," he says. "You can eat very nicely without spending
  the kitchen sink."
  
  Coat the cooking area of a wok or deep frying pan with sesame oil and heat
  until very hot. First, saute broccoli, asparagus, and carrots for a few
  minutes. Then add zucchini, snow peas, and peppers and cook for another
  minute or two. Add tofu and scallions last. Saute everything in sesame oil
  for 2 more minutes. Then add tamari or soy sauce to taste and cook a little
  longer, until vegetables are tender but not overcooked. Vegetables should
  be stirred frequently and cooking time should not exceed 20 minutes.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2    Chicken thighs
     12 md Asparagus spears
      3 tb Peanut or corn oil
           MARINADE:
      1 tb Dry sherry
      1 ts Cornstarch
      2 ts Thin soy sauce
      1 pn Sugar
           SAUCE:
      2 ts Fermented black beans
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/2 ts Brown sugar
      2 ts Black soy sauce
    3/4 c  Chicken stock
           Cornstarch paste as
           -thickener
 
  Marinating:  With sharp paring knife, scrape chicken meat from thigh; slice
  into thin strips across the grain.  (Breast meat is not preferred for this
  dish, as meat is too dry and spongy.)  Combine sherry, soy, cornstarch and
  sugar in bowl; massage liquid into meat with your fingers. Marinate for 15
  to
  30 minutes.
  Preparation:  Wash asparagus; peel tough white outer skin off ends; slice
  on
  diagonal in 2 1/2" sections.  Rinse fermented black beans. In bowl, combine
  and mash black beans and garlic, brown sugar, black soy sauce and chicken
  stock; stir; reserve for 15 minutes.
  Stir-Frying:  Add 2/3 of oil to hot wok; when oil is very hot, add chicken.
  Stir-fry for about 3 minutes on high heat - or until chicken begins to
  shrink
  and firm up.  Remove chicken to holding bowl.
  Reheat wok to high, add remaining oil.  When oil is hot, add black bean
  sauce.  Stir-fry for 1 minute.  Add asparagus; mix with sauce. Stir sauce
  with asparagus.  When sauce boils, add cooked chicken; toss to combine.
  Dribble in a little cornstarch paste if needed; cornstarch in chicken
  marinade might be enough.  Toss ingredients until very little liquid
  remains
  and is reduced to glaze.  Dish is ready when asparagus brightens. If you
  still have too much liquid, remove ingredients, continue to reduce sauce,
  then return ingredients to coat them with sauce. Serve in individual
  portions.

 Categories: Italian, Soups/stews, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      2 lb Asparagus, trimmed, peeled
           -and cut (1 inch pieces)
           Salt and pepper
      1 qt Chicken broth
      4    Eggs
    1/2 c  Freshly grated Parmesan or
           -pecorino cheese
      6 sl Italian bread, toasted
 
  Heat the oil and garlic in a soup pot until the garlic is golden. Add the
  asparagus and cook until they begin to color.  Season with salt and pepper.
  Add the broth and bring to a boil; reduce the heat and simmer for 15
  minutes, or until the asparagus is tender.
  
  Beat the eggs and cheese together.  When the asparagus is tender, reduce
  the heat so the soup is no longer simmering.  Very slowly ladle some of the
  hot soup into the beaten eggs, stirring continuously.  After adding about 2
  cups of the hot soup to the eggs, reverse the process and gradually stir
  the eggs mixture into the soup pot.  The soup must not boil or the eggs
  will scramble.  Heat until thickened.
  
  Put one slice of toasted bread into each soup dish.  Ladle the hot soup on
  top and pass additional grated cheese.
  
  Serves 6.
  
  NOTE:  To trim asparagus, hold the tip in one hand and the base of the
  stalk in the other.  Bend gently.  The asparagus will snap, leaving the
  tender part with the tip.

      1    TEMPURA SAUCE RECIPE
 
       Make several crosswise slits on the underside of shrimp to prevent
  curling.  Parboil green beans.  Pat shrimp and vegetables dry; arrange on
  platter; cover and refridgerate until serving time. Prepare batter and
  sauce recipes.  Do not make batter recipe too far ahead of time.
       Heat oil in a wok to 360 degrees.  Dep shrimp and vegetables into
  batter with tongs; allow excess batter to drip into bowl. Fry a few pieces
  at a time until golden brown, turning once (cooking time approximately 2-3
  minutes).     This is best prepared close to or at the table. It is great
  fun to have a "tempura party" with guests cooking their own. Serve with
  sauce and rice. (you may need more batter mix depending on the amounts of
  seafood and vegetables you prepare).  Does not keep well once cooked.

      Title: ASPARAGUS AND CHICKEN IN BLACK BEAN SAUCE
 Categories: Chinese, Poultry
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2    Chicken thighs
     12 md Asparagus spears
      3 tb Peanut or corn oil

----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
      1 tb Dry sherry
      1 ts Cornstarch
      2 ts Thin soy sauce
      1 pn Sugar

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
      2 ts Fermented black beans
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/2 ts Brown sugar
      2 ts Black soy sauce
    3/4 c  Chicken stock
           Cornstarch paste
 
  Marinating:  With sharp paring knife, scrape chicken meat from thigh; slice
  into thin strips across the grain. (Breast meat is not preferred for this
  dish, as meat is too dry and spongy.) Combine sherry, soy, cornstarch and
  sugar in bowl; massage liquid into meat with your fingers. Marinate for 15
  to 30 minutes.
  
  Preparation:  Wash asparagus; peel tough white outer skin off ends; slice
  on diagonal in 2 1/2" sections. Rinse fermented black beans. In bowl,
  combine and mash black beans and garlic, brown sugar, black soy sauce and
  chicken stock; stir; reserve for 15 minutes.
  
  Stir Frying:  Add 2/3 of oil to hot wok; when oil is very hot, add chicken.
  Stir-fry for about 3 minutes on high heat - or until chicken begins to
  shrink and firm up. Remove chicken to holding bowl.
  
  Reheat wok to high, add remaining oil.  When oil is hot, add black bean
  sauce.  Stir-fry for 1 minute. Add asparagus; mix with sauce. Stir sauce
  with asparagus. When sauce boils, add cooked chicken; toss to combine.
  Dribble in a little cornstarch paste if needed; cornstarch in chicken
  marinade might be enough. Toss ingredients until very little liquid remains
  and is reduced to glaze. Dish is ready when asparagus brightens. If you
  still have too much liquid, remove ingredients, continue to reduce sauce,
  then return ingredients to coat them with sauce. Serve in individual
  portions.

      Title: ASPARAGUS AND SESAME CHICKEN SOUP
 Categories: Chinese, Poultry, Soups/stews
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Chicken
      3 tb Sesame oil
      6    Slices ginger root
    1/2 c  Medium sherry
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Warm water
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2 c  Button mushrooms, canned
      8    Fresh asparagus spears
 
  Preparation:  Rinse chicken, remove fat pockets, pat dry, and chop into
  bite-size pieces.  NOTE:  if tempted to use breast meat without bones,
  please don`t; bones add to body and flavor of soup. Peel and slice ginger
  root.  Wash and cut asparagus into 2" sections.
  
  Braising:  Heat wok to medium hot.  Add sesame oil. Start braising chicken
  a few pieces at a time when oil begins to smell. Sesame oil will burn at
  lower temperature than other cooking oils, so avoid hot wok. After browning
  lightly, return chicken pieces to wok; add ginger slices, sherry and salt.
  When sherry boils, add water and sugar. Turn up heat, bring to boil, then
  reduce heat to simmer, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Add mushrooms and
  asparagus, simmer for another 15 minutes.
  
  Transfer to covered soup tureen (or put plate on top of soup bowl), place
  in steamer on low, and hold until ready to serve.
  
  You can make this soup in large sauce pan, if wok is needed for something
  else.

 Categories: Side dish, Digest
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Fresh asparagus, washed well
           -and cut into 1" pieces
      1    Red pepper, seeded and cut
           -into 1/4" x 1" pieces
      1    Red onion, chopped
    1/2 c  Raspberry vinegar
    1/2 c  Water
      1 tb Sugar or honey
      1 ts Parsley
 
  Steam the asparagus pieces for 2 minutes.  Plunge into cold water to stop
  cooking.  Drain.
  
  Put asparagus, red pepper and onion into a plastic bowl (with cover). Blend
  vinegar, water, sugar (honey) and parsley in a separate bowl and then pour
  over vegetables.  Adjust seasonings if desired (may want to add more
  sweetness).  Stir, cover and refrigerate for at least 24 hours. Stir every
  so often.
  
  Serve cold as a side salad.
  
  Hint:  make sure you only use the tender part of the asparagus.  My mom
  taught me that you hold the tip and base of the asparagus in separate hands
  and then bend it until it breaks.  Only use the tip end and use the base
  end for soup or compost it.

  tender.
  
  2. Puree asparagus/broth in blender. Take out some pieces for a
  chunkier consistency if you wish.
  
  3. Put puree back in pan and add red pepper, any reserved asparagus, black
  pepper, and can of milk.
  
  4. Heat until thickened to your liking.
  
  NOTE: You can add some thickener(flour,cornstarch) to hasten the process. I
  started the pepper roasting at about the same time as the the asparagus,
  and it worked out fine to add to soup.
  
  Serve with a salad and hearty bread!

      Title: THAI-STYLE, SPICY EGGPLANT-MUSHROOM SAUCE
 Categories: Thai, Digest
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 lb Mushrooms
      1 md Shallot
      2 md Garlic cloves
    1/2 ts Hunan style red chili paste
  1 1/2 c  Rice milk or milk
           -substitute
      1 lb Eggplant
      1 md Red bell pepper
    1/2 c  Chopped asparagus stems
           -(originally this was peas)
    1/2 c  Fresh basil leaves
      2 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Plum sauce
    1/2 ts Ginger
    1/4 c  Veggie stock
      2    3 drops toasted sesame oil
      2 ts Tapioca flour (see note)
 
  Mince garlic and shallot; quarter mushrooms, dice eggplant into 1-inch
  cubes and slice red bell pepper into long strips.
  
  In a large frying pan, on medium head add stock and mushrooms.  Simmer for
  5 minutes or until mushrooms are tender and brown.  Remove mushrooms and
  set aside.  In remaining stock add shallot and garlic, sautee for 1-2
  minutes.  Add chili paste and milk.  Bring mixture to a boil then reduce
  heat and simmer on low for 5 minutes, stirring often. Add sugar, plum sauce
  and sesame oil (only a few drops!  It's amazing the flavor it adds). Add
  eggplant, asparagus stems and red bell pepper. Bring mixture back up to a
  boil.  Cover and simmer for 15 minutes stirring occasionally until eggplant
  and asparagus are tender. In the last 5 minutes add mushrooms and fresh
  basil leaves.
  
  Serve over grilled polenta (recipe follows) or rice and the steamed
  asparagus tips.
  
  Note: When I made this recipe I felt that the sauce was too thin.  The
  original recipe called for coconut milk and olive oil as the sauce's base.
  How I remedied this problem was as follows: I removed all the vegetables
  from the pan using a slotted spoon and turned the heat down to the lowest
  setting.  I placed them in the serving bowl and set aside. In a measuring
  cup I added 1/3 cup cold water and 2 heaping teaspoons of tapioca flour
  (not pearls).  Once this was thoroughly mixed I poured it into the sauce
  while stirring with the slotted spoon. In less than a minute the sauce had
  thickened very nicely.  I then poured the sauce into the bowl over the
  vegetables and served. It was pleasantly spicy (go light on the red chili
  paste if you dislike REALLY hot foods) and filling.
  
  Note2:  if you wanted to be more authentic you could try adding some
  coconut extract...

      Title: FF NO-CREAM ASPARAGUS SOUP (VEGAN)
 Categories: Digest, Nov., Opt. lacto
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 md Onions, chopped
      2 md Leeks (white and pale green
           Parts only), chopped
      6 c  Vegetable stock
      2 lb Asparagus, each cut into 4
           Pieces
        x  White pepper
      1 pk Butter buds (optional)
 
  Microwave the onions and leeks until tender or saute in water over medium
  heat until tender.  Add stock and the asparagus and simmer until tender,
  about 15 minutes.  Puree soup in blender in batches and strain through a
  fine strainer.  Return to pot and season with white pepper to taste. You
  may now add the butter buds if you desire a butter flavor.
  
  Makes about 8 cups.  Can be served hot or cold.  Keeps well in the
  refrigerator for several days.
  
  I use this as my basic soup recipe and have successfully replaced the
  asparagus with beets, broccoli, carrot, acorn squash, butternut squash, and
  red kuri squash. You can make quite an impression by making both the acorn
  and butternut squash soups at the same time and serving them in the same
  bowl.  Just slowly pour both soups into opposite sides of the bowl at the
  same time.  I usually serve this with garlic croutons.

      Title: ASPARAGUS AND MUSHROOMS WITH BLACK BEAN SAUCE
 Categories: Digest, Dec.
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Asparagus, stiff ends
           Peeled
    1/4 lb Brown button mushrooms (or
           Mixed mushrooms)
      2    Garlic cloves
      1 tb Fermented black soybeans
  1 1/2 tb Rice vinegar
      1 tb Tamari (or soy sauce)
      1 ts Potato starch (or
           Cornstarch)
      1 ts Brown sugar
      1 tb Sake or other rice wine
 
  Cut asparagus on the diagonal into 1-2 inch pieces.
  Blanch for 5 minutes in boiling water.  Drain and set
  aside.
  
  Wash and slice mushrooms. Set aside.
  
  Mince the garlic. Rinse the black beans well.  Mix
  garlic and beans together. Set aside.
  
  Mix together the rice vinegar, tamari, starch, sugar,
  and sake.  Set aside.
  
  Fill a glass with water and set handy next to the
  stove.  Put a skillet over high heat.  When the pan is
  hot, dump the garlic mixture into the pan. Stir fry
  for one minute, adding water as the mixture begins to
  stick -- add just a little at time.  Add the asparagus
  and stir fry for 10 minutes (or until asparagus is
  just shy of being crisp-done), again adding water just
  as needed.  Add mushrooms and stir fry for 2-5 more
  minutes. Add the vinegar mixture (giving it a last
  stir to make sure starch is well mixed), stir until
  evenly coated and sauce thickens. Serve immediately.
  
  Comments:
  
  Fermented black soybeans are available in Asian
  markets.  Usually labled "salted black beans".  I find
  them in the preserved food section in plastic bags.

  asparagus and Parmesan. Spoon rice in a layer over lamb and garnish with
  the chopped tomatoes.

      2 lb Pork bones
      2 ts Salt
      1 tb Fish sauce (nuoc mam)
      1 ts Vegetable oil
      1    Clove garlic, chopped
      2    Shallots or
      2    Scallions, chopped white
           -part
    1/2 lb Crab meat, fresh, frozen,
           -or canned
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      2 ts Cornstarch dissolved in

    1/4 c  Chopped scallion greens
 
  The French introduced asparagus to the Vietnamese, who promptly
  incorporated this classic vegetable into their cuisine.  The
  Vietnamese word for asparagus is "Western bamboo," due to its
  resemblance to bamboo shoots. asparagus is universally popular
  throughout Vietnam, this light, tasty dish will delight your family
  as well.
  
  Bring water to a boil and put the pork bones in.  Remove the scum,
  then cover and continue to boil the bones for 1 hour.  Remove the
  bones from the stock and discard.  Add the salt and the fish sauce to
  the stock.
  
  Heat the oil and add the chopped garlic and shallots; add the crab
  meat and fry for 5 minutes over high heat.  Sprinkle with 1/8
  teaspoon of black pepper, stirring constantly, then add the crab meat
  mixture to the soup and bring to a boil.  Add the
  cornstarch-and-water mixture and stir for a few minutes.
  
  Break the egg open and drop it into the actively boiling soup while
  stirring.  Cook, still stirring, for about 2 minutes, then drop in the
  asparagus, along with the liquid from the can and the rest of the
  black pepper.  Continue to cook until the asparagus is heated through.
  
  Sprinkle the coriander and scallion green over the soup before
  serving.
  
  Makes 6 to 8 servings.

      Title: POTATO CREPES WITH SCALLOPS, SALMON AND ASPARAGUS
 Categories: Pancakes, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 servings
 
    1/2 lb Fresh asparagus
      1 tb Dry white wine
    1/2 ts Cornstarch
      1    Egg white
    1/8 ts White pepper
    1/4 lb Scallops
    1/4 lb Salmon filet
           Potato crepes (see recipe)
  1 1/2 c  Peanut oil
      1 ts Minced fresh ginger
      1 tb Minced green onion
    1/8 ts White pepper
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
      2 ts Soy sauce
    1/2 ts Rice vinegar
    1/4 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Cornstarch dissolved in 1
           -teaspoon water
 
  Starting at the tip end, cut the asparagus into 1 1/2-inch lengths
  with a diagonal rolling cut:  slice off the tip at an angle, roll the
  asparagus about a quarter turn and cut again, and repeat on down the
  stalk until you reach the tougher base.  Discard the bases.  Dissolve
  the cornstarch in the wine in a medium bowl; add the egg white and
  pepper and beat lightly. Remove the tough white muscle from the edge
  of each scallop and cut the scallops into 1/4-inch-thick discs.
  Remove any pin bones from the salmon and slice across the width of
  the slice (parallel to the backbone) into 1/4-inch-thick rectangles.
  Add the salmon and scallops to the egg mixture and toss gently to
  coat. Preheat the oven to 175F and set 2 dinner plates in it to warm.
  Prepare the Potato Crepes and place 1 on each plate. Keep warm in the
  oven. Have a clean, dry, heatproof container, such as a saucepan, on
  the stove with a heat proof sieve on top. Drain the scallops and
  salmon and discard the marinade. Heat a wok or deep skillet over high
  heat. When it begins to smoke, add the oil. Wait 30 seconds, then add
  the seafood (the oil will not be very hot yet; this is intentional).
  Cook, stirring gently to separate the pieces, until salmon has lost
  its raw color.  Pour the contents of the wok into the sieve. Return
  the wok to the heat, and in the bit of oil clinging to the pan,
  stir-fry the ginger and green onion until fragrant.  Add the pepper
  and asparagus and stir-fry until it begins to brown.  Add the chicken
  stock, soy sauce, vinegar and sugar.  Cover, and cook until the
  asparagus is crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes depending on size.  Remove
  the cover, return the seafood to the wok, and stir in the cornstarch
  mixture.  Cook until the sauce is slightly thickened.  Taste for
  seasoning and adjust if necessary, then divide the seafood, asparagus
  and sauce over the potato crepes. Serve immediately Serves 2. From
  the San Francisco Chronicle, 2/13/91. Note that the potato pancakes
  require the potatoes to be cooked and cooled ahead of time, which can
  be done earlier in the day or the night before. Posted by Stephen

      Title: QUAIL BREASTS AND TRUFFLE SALAD
 Categories: Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Herb vinaigrette (see below)
           Truffle juice vinaigrette
           -(see below)
     32    Asparagus tips
     50 g  Chanterelles   (cleaned)
     12 qt Breasts
      1    Or 2 uncooked yellow
           -zucchini (sliced into 48
           -very thin circles)
      1 lg Tomato (brunoised)
     15 g  Frisee lettuce (cleaned)
     12    Italian parsley leaves
     30 g  Truffle (sliced into 12
           -very thin circles)
           Butter
           Seasoning - salt, pepper,
           -chicken stock
           White wine
 
  The remaining recipes are Western and somewhat Frenchified to my eyes.
  They're "nouveaux" at the very least.  Little dabs of food artfully
  arranged here and there on a plate, sometimes connected by skeins of
  sauces.  Expensive too.  This one calls for chanterelles and 30 grams
  of truffles, a little over an ounce.
  
  Establishment: The Regent Hotel (Hong Kong) Salisbury Road,
  Tsimshatsui, Kowloon. Western Cuisine Practical Class Gold Award -
  Hors d'oeuvre Chef: Patrick Lin (The Regent Hotel)
  
  To prepare: 1. Make herb vinaigrette from onion, chives, Italian
  parsley, parsley and a pinch of tarragon, all finely chopped
  together.  (Keep some chopped herbs aside to use in chanterelles
  preparation - see below.) Add salt, pepper, walnut oil, sherry and
  vinegar, according to taste.
  
  2.  Make truffle juice vinaigrette from bottled truffle juice, salt,
  olive oil and vinegar.  (For both vinaigrettes recommended ratio of
  oil to vinegar is 2:1.)
  
  3.  Cut asparagus tips off stems with slanting cuts (so that they will
  stand up at an angle in central garnish.)
  
  To cook: 1. Lightly salt chanterelles and saute over a low flame in
  butter, with a drop of white wine, a few drops of chicken stock, and
  a mixture of the same herbs that were used to make herb vinaigrette
  (see above).
  
  2.  Reduce sauteed mixture completely, and then marinate chanterelles
  in herb vinaigrette for 30 minutes.
  
  3.  Clean quail breasts and season with salt and pepper.  In a
  restaurant kitchen they would be grilled - for home cooking, pan-fry
  in hot melted butter quickly for about one minute top and bottom
  until they are golden brown all over.
  
  To present: 1. Create central garnish by arranging a wheel of eleven
  overlapping yellow zucchini slices, placing a small heap of tomato
  brunoise on one central slice.  Place asparagus tips pointing
  outwards from centre.
  
  2.  Create three distinct islands of chanterelles topped with frisee
  lettuce and Italian parsley.  Place three truffle slices between
  chanterelle islands and lay one quail breast on each.  Pour a little
  truffle juice vinaigrette over quails and central garnish, and a
  little herb vinaigrette over lettuce.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

  This is some serious food++as most of these recipes are.  They are the
  creations of one of the most intense culinary environments in the
  world and the competition is fierce.  I've never seen the Bamboo
  Fungus called for in this soup in any of the Asian markets I've been
  in and preparing a Shark's Fin is not for the impatient.
  
  Establishment: Bui Hang Village Restaurant (Hotel Miramar) UG/F.,

  Chinese Cuisine Practical Class Platinum Award - Shark's Fin "Gossamer
  curtains veiling exquisite feminine shadows" would be a justifiably
  poetical translation for the mood-setting name of this dish. The
  bamboo fungus, a deluxe vegetarian ingredient with almost mystical
  connotations, is envisaged as a curtain of delicate fibres, through
  which the beguilingly beautiful forms of the superlative shark's fin
  can be glimpsed. Red Mayflowers (denoted by the crab roe) are
  "embroidered" on the curtains, adding a third level of appetizing
  connotations.
  
  To prepare 1. Soak, shark's fin for 4 hours in cold water, and then
  simmer over medium heat for 10 hours. 2. Clean bamboo fungi and soak
  in cold water for 3 to 4 hours. 3. Steam-clean crab claws for
  approximately 3 minutes on plate on wok stand above boiling water. 4.
  Make shrimp paste by mixing shrimp meat with cornstarch and pinch of
  salt.
  
  To cook 1. Mix simmering ingredients with water (sufficient to cover
  fin) and bring to the boil.  Add cooled shark's fin and boil for 5
  minutes. Dram well and stuff inside bamboo fungi. 2. Arrange stuffed
  fungi on a deep plate.  Mix 1 cup of stock and 1/4 tsp of salt and
  pour over fungi. Cover and steam for 15 minutes. 3. Coat each claw
  with 10 g of shrimp paste, garish with a sprig of coriander, place in
  a deep plate, cover and steam for 3 minutes. 4. Add 1 cup oil to
  heated wok, then add asparagus and saute for 30 seconds. Drain and
  place asparagus in 3 cups of salted water and simmer until just
  cooked. Drain and refresh with cold water. 5. Stir-fry bean sprouts
  in a heated wok with 1 tbs oil, 1/2 tsp salt and ginger juice until
  half-cooked, but still crunchy.  Remove from wok. 6. To make crab roe
  sauce, add water, cornstarch and salt to stock. Over a high flame,
  bring to the boil.  Add crab roe and bring to the boil again (at
  which point presentation platter should be ready for this sauce).
  
  To present 1. Arrange stuffed bamboo fungi like spokes of a wheel,
  pointing inwards on serving dish.  Lay asparagus and crab claws
  between them. 2. Pour freshly boiled crab roe sauce over dish.  Pile
  bean sprouts in centre, top with shredded ham.

  Heat peanut oil in a wok or skillet and stir-fry meat and onion
  mixture for 1 to 2 minutes; meat should be well seared but still pink
  inside.
  
  Immediately pour over blanched vegetable and serve.  Or place on
  heated platter and surround with tomato wedges
  
  Variation with oyster sauce:  Omit hoisin sauce and sesame oil and
  add one tablespoon oyster sauce.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 c  Cold water
    1/2    Lemon
      6    Baby artichokes
      6    Thin asparagus spears,
           -trimmed, cut into 1" pieces
      8 oz Orecchlette (ear-shaped)
           -pasta
      1 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Unsalted butter
    1/4 c  Chopped scallions
      2    Garlic cloves, slivered
    1/3 c  Oil-cured black olives,
           -pitted
    1/2 c  Tiny green peas (if using

      4 tb Fresh grated Parmesan cheese
           Salt to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  (From "The New Basics Cookbook) by Julee Rosso and Shiela Lukins.
  Workman.)
  
  Fill the mixing bowl with the cold water and squeeze the lemon juice
  into it. Drop the lemon half into the water as well. Set the bowl
  aside.
  
  Using a sharp knife, trim off and discard the top 1/2" of each
  artichoke. Dip the cut tops into the acidulated water (to keep them
  from turning brown).
  
  Pull the outer leaves off the artichokes, leaving a core of tender
  green leaves. Gently pry open the artichokes; using a small melon
  baller, scoop out and discard the chokes.
  
  Cut the artichokes vertically into three or four slices, dropping them
  into the acidulated water as you work.
  
  Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Drain the
  artichokes, and add them to the pan. Simmer for 10 minutes. Then
  drain the artichokes, reserving the cooking liquid and rinse them
  under cold water. Set them aside.
  
  Bring the reserve artichoke cooking liquid to a boil, and add the
  asparagus. Simmer for 3 minutes; then drain, again reserving the
  liquid. Rinse the asparagus under cold water, and set it aside.
  
  Bring a large pot of fresh water to a boil. Add the orecchlette, and
  cook at a rolling boil until just tender.
  
  Meanwhile, heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in a
  saucepan. Saute the scallions and garlic for 3 minutes. Then stir in
  the olives, peas, reserved artichokes and asparagus, remaining 1
  tablespoon butter, 1/3 cup of the reserved cooking liquid, and 3
  tablespoons of the Parmesan. Stir well, and cook just until heated
  through, 2 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the pasta cooking water,
  and transfer the sauce to a heated serving bowl.
  
  Drain the pasta, and toss it in the bowl with the sauce until well
  coated. Season with salt, pepper and the additional 1 tablespoon
  grated Parmesan. Serve immediately.

           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
           Radish roses for garnish
 
  (From "Mediterranean Light" by Martha Rose Shulman, Bantam).
  
  Roast 2 of the red peppers, either under a broiler or above a burner
  flame, turning until all sides are charred. Remove from the heat and
  place in a paper bag or damp towel. Allow to cool.
  
  Meanwhile, cut off the tips of the asparagus, about 2" from the top.
  Trim off the tough base of the asparagus and cut the remaining stalks
  into pieces about 1/2" long. Keep the tops separate from the stalks.
  cut the remaining red pepper into thin lengthwise strips and cut
  these strips in half or into thirds.
  
  When the roasted peppers are cool enough to handle, remove the skins
  and pat dry. Remove the stems, seeds and membranes and cut into thin
  strips. Place in a bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil,
  1 of the garlic cloves, the coarse salt, and 8 large leaves basil,
  cut into slivers. Toss together, cover, and refrigerate for at least
  1 hour.
  
  Mince the remaining basil. Steam the peas, asparagus tips, and
  asparagus stalks separately, just until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes
  for the asparagus, 5-10 minutes for the peas. Refresh under cold
  water.
  
  Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt, and cook the pasta al
  dente. Drain and toss with the remaining olive oli, which you have
  mixed with the remaining garlic clove. Refrigerate until shortly
  before ready to serve or leave at room temperature if serving soon.
  
  Shortly before serving, toss the pasta with the steamed peas,
  asparagus stalks, sliced raw pepper, minced basil, parsley, Parmesan
  and salt and pepper to taste. Serve on individual plates and top each
  portion with a spoonful of roasted red peppers. Place spears of
  asparagus and a few radishes on the side and serve.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Asparagus, fresh, young,
           -- preferably thin, stalks,
           -- bottoms trimmed off
           --
           --
           --

-----------------------------------PASTRY-----------------------------------
    1/2 lb Puff Pastry **

-------------------------------LEMON DRESSING-------------------------------
      2 lg Egg yolks
      2 ts Mustard, Dijon
      1 md Lemon, juice of
           Salt (to taste)
           Pepper, white (to taste)
      1 c  Oil, olive, extra-virgin
 
  ** See recipe for Puff Pastry.
  
  For the pastry cornets:
  =======================
  
       Roll the pastry out onto a lightly floured work surface to 3" x
  20" rectangle, 1/4" thick.  Cut the rectangle into 4 long strips, each
  3/4" wide.
  
       Wrap each strip around a long metal cone (which can be made from
  heavy-duty aluminum foil), beginning at the tip and rolling the strip
  around and around, overlapping slightly.  Place these on an ungreased
  baking sheet and refrigerate for 1 hour or more.
  
       Preheat oven to 375 F.
  
       Bake pastry cornets until golden, about 15 minutes.
  
       Cool briefly, then very carefully the metal or foil cones.
  
  For the lemon dressing:
  =======================
  
       Combine the egg yolks, mustard, lemon juice, and salt and pepper.
  Whisk in the oil a drop at a time.  When the dressing begins to
  thicken, add the oil 1 teaspoon at a time, then continue adding oil in
  a thin stream.
  
       Adjust seasonings to taste.
  
       Cook the asparagus, tied in bundles, in boiling salted water
  until it's just crisp-tender; drain.
  
  Construction:
  =============
  
       Pour a small amount of dressing on each serving plate.
  
       Place a cornet on top of the dressing and tuck the asparagus into
  the ends of the cornet, fanning the tips outward.

      Title:  ASPARAGUS SAUCE - GREAT CHEFS
 Categories: Basics, Sauces, Masterchefs, Frisco, Relf
      Yield: 1 servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Asparagus, medium/small
      2 oz Butter, unsalted
      2 c  Cream, heavy
           Salt (to taste)
           Pepper (to taste)
 
       Wash the asparagus and snap off the white ends.  Set aside all
  tops and half that number of ends.  Plunge the tops into a large pot
  of salted, boiling water and cook until limp but not for too long.
  (Note: Cook slightly longer than for eating.  If undercooked, they
  will not process well; if overcooked, they will taste earthy.)
  
       Drain the asparagus thoroughly and, while still hot, run it
  through food processor with unsalted butter for 3 - 4 minutes until
  smooth, scraping down the sides of the processor frequently.
  
       Meanwhile, chop asparagus ends to remove the dry hard field cuts
  and simmer with cream.  Cook the ends slowly for 20 minutes, then
  strain, pressing through gently.  Just before serving, combine
  asparagus, butter and cream.  Heat slowly to just below boiling point.
  Adjust the seasonings to taste.

      Title:  SALMON WITH ASPARAGUS SAUCE
 Categories: Seafood, Masterchefs, Frisco, Relf
      Yield: 4 servings
 
-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Asparagus, medium/small
      2 oz Butter, unsalted
      2 c  Cream, heavy
           Salt (to taste)
           Pepper (to taste)

----------------------------------ASSEMBLY----------------------------------
      8 ea Salmon, steaks, 3/4-inch
           -- thick, boned
      2 oz Butter
 
  For the Sauce:
  ==============
  
       Wash the asparagus and snap off the white ends.  Set aside all tops
  and half that number of ends.  Plunge the tops into a large pot of salted,
  boiling water and cook until limp but not for too long. (Note: Cook
  slightly longer than for eating.  If undercooked, they will not process
  well; if overcooked, they will taste earthy.)
  
       Drain the asparagus thoroughly and, while still hot, run it through
  food processor with unsalted butter for 3 - 4 minutes until smooth,
  scraping down the sides of the processor frequently.
  
       Meanwhile, chop asparagus ends to remove the dry hard field cuts and
  simmer with cream.  Cook the ends slowly for 20 minutes, then strain,
  pressing through gently.  Just before serving, combine asparagus, butter
  and cream.  Heat slowly to just below boiling point. Adjust the seasonings
  to taste.
  
  To Assemble:
  ============
  
       Salt and pepper the salmon steaks.  Melt the butter in a heavy enamel
  or copper saute pan.  When the butter begins to brown, add salmon and cook
  one side for 30 seconds.
  
       Remove the pan from heat, turn the salmon carefully, and let cook in
  the hot pan off of the heat for 30 seconds.  Salmon will still be quite
  rare.  If you like your fish done more, add to the cooking time slightly.
  Don't overcook!  The salmon loses a lot of flavor when overcooked.
  
       Place the salmon on a towel (cloth or paper) to drain.
  
       Just before you finish cooking the salmon, spoon some of the sauce
  onto heated plates; then place the cooked drained salmon on top of the
  sauce and serve immediately.
  
       Preparation time:  1 hour

      Title: ASPARAGUS WITH BLUE CHEESE
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Asparagus; cleaned
      2 ts Red wine vinegar
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Chives; minced
      4 tb Blue cheese; crumbled
           White pepper; freshly ground
 
  Snap ends off asparagus spears.  Fill medium skillet with 1-inch water and
  bring to a boil.  Add asparagus in single layer and cook 8 to 10 minutes or
  until tender. Drain well and arrange on a serving plate. Stir together
  vinegar and oil in sm bowl.  Add blue cheese and chives and mix well. Pour
  over hot asparagus. Season to taste with plenty of white pepper. Set aside
  until tepid, then serve.
  
  Hint on cleaning asparagus:  Hold the bottom end of the stem in one hand
  and gently bend the stalk with the other. The stalk will break where it is
  tender, thus giving you a piece of asparagus that is entirely edible. With
  a little practice you will know exactly where to break the vegetable. Save
  the broken-off ends for soups. Slice and add to soup stock, then drain and
  discard the coarse stalks before serving.

           Nutmeg; to taste

----------------------------------GARNISH----------------------------------
     24    Fiddlehead ferns
           -=OR=- Asparagus tips
      2 tb Butter

--------------------------------FOR PHEASANT--------------------------------
      2    Pheasant breasts
           - (from 3 lb pheasants)
           - boned, skinned & halved
           Salt
           White pepper
      2 tb Butter
 
  Prepare the fettucine.  Clean any soil clinging to the morel stems.
  Place the mushrooms in a spice mill and grind to a fine powder.
  Combine the powder with the semolina and all-purpose flours in a food
  processor and process briefly to blend.  Beat the eggs, egg yolks and
  oil together and, with the motor running, add the mixture to the
  flours.  Process until a neat ball forms on top of the blade, about
  45 to 60 seconds.  Remove the dough from the machine and knead for a
  minute on a very lightly floured surface. Pat into a thick cylinder
  and wrap in plastic.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
  
  About 1 hour before serving time, cut the dough across into 6 pieces.
  Knead, stretch, and cut each piece in a pasta machine or by hand.
  Spread the fettucine on a tray dusted with semolina.  Cover with a
  towel until cooking time.
  
  Prepare the sauce.  Soak the mushrooms in warm water to cover for 5
  minutes.  (Halve and rinse fresh morels.)  Drain the mushrooms, halve
  them lengthwise and rinse briefly.  Cut into small pieces.  Heat the
  butter in a skillet and add the morels and shallots.  Cook over low
  heat until the shallots are tender.  Add the cream and simmer,
  stirring often, until the sauce is lightly thickened, about 15
  minutes.  Season with salt, white pepper and nutmeg to taste.  The
  sauce can be prepared and gently reheated just before serving.
  
  Rub any fuzz from the fiddlehead ferns and trim the tails to leave
  about 1/2 inch.  Drop them into boiling salted water and cook until
  tender, about 5 minutes.  Drain well.  At serving time, heat them
  through in the butter.
  
  About 20 minutes before serving time, sprinkle the pheasant breasts
  lightly with salt and white pepper and let them sit at room
  temperature until you are ready to cook.  Heat the butter in a large,
  heavy skillet. When it foams, add the breasts and brown lightly for
  about 5 minutes. Turn and cook over moderately low heat until they
  are nicely browned and barely done in the center, about 5 more
  minutes.  Remove them and let them sit for 5 minutes.
  
  Drop the noodles into a large quantity of boiling salted water.
  Return to a boil, stirring.  Cook about 1 minute, just until tender.
  Drain them thoroughly and toss with three-quarters of the sauce.
  
  Arrange the fettucine on 4 serving plates.  Slice each pheasant
  breast in 6 vertical slices and fan over the pasta.  Top with the
  remaining sauce and surround with the fiddlehead ferns.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 tb Butter
      1    Onion, chopped
  1 1/2 lb Asparagus, fresh
      2 tb Flour
      6 c  Water, boiling
      2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Chicken broth, rich
           -(optional)
      2    Egg yolks
    1/2 c  Milk
 
  Melt the butter in a pan big enough to cook the soup.  Saute the onions for
  a few minutes, until transparent but not brown.
  
  Meanwhile, slice the asparagus into thin slices.  Now add the sliced
  asparagus pieces to the onions and continue to saute (over medium to
  medium-high heat) for 15 minutes, until most of the moisture has steamed
  out of the asparagus and the mixture has just barely started to brown.
  
  Add the flour to the onion/asparagus mixture and stir well to coat each
  piece with some flour. Cook for 2 or 3 more minutes over medium-high heat.
  Dump the boiling water into the asparagus mixture. Add the (optional)
  chicken broth and the salt. Simmer for 1 hour.
  
  Strain out the cooked asparagus, leaving behind a thin yellow-green soup.
  Thicken the soup with the 2 egg yolks.  Add the milk and reheat the soup to
  serving temperature.  Add salt and fresh-ground white pepper to taste.
  Serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A light and simple asparagus soup -- Every summer, it seems,  the
  grocery stores are glutted with cheap asparagus. Most of the classical
  recipes for asparagus soup produce a hearty winter-style soup. Here's a
  simple recipe for a delicious, light, thin soup that is more in keeping
  with the time of the year that the glut occurs. You can leave out the
  chicken broth to make it a meatless soup, but it does require egg yolks.
  Yield:  Serves 4-6.
  
  *  The slicing disk on a food processor does an excellent job of slicing
  the asparagus for this recipe. You can use a food mill, a china cap, or an
  ordinary sieve to strain the cooked asparagus out of the broth.
  
  *  Don't try to make this soup as a low-salt soup by leaving out the salt.
   It will taste like dishwater if you cook the asparagus for an hour without
  salt. Don't try to skimp on time by leaving the cooked asparagus in the
  broth unstrained. It will ruin the texture.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate (thickening soup with egg yolks is not a
  beginner's skill).
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour simmering, 5 minutes finishing.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: ZUPPA DI ASPARAGI (Calabrian Asparagus Soup)
 Categories: Soups, Vegetarian, Italian
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2    Garlic clove; minced
      2 tb Olive oil; extra-virgin
      2 lb Asparagus; trimmed & cut
           -into 1" pieces
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper, black
      4 c  Vegetable broth; OR
      4 c  Low-sodium chicken broth
      4    Eggs
    1/2 c  Parmesan; grated, plus extra
           -for serving
      6 sl Italian bread; toasted
 
  In a large saucepan, cook the garlic in the olive oil over moderate
  heat, stirring constantly, until golden, about 3 minutes. Add the
  asparagus and cook until bright green, about 5 minutes.  Add the
  salt, pepper and Vegetable Broth and bring to a boil.  Reduce the
  heat to moderately low and simmer until the asparagus are tender,
  about 15 minutes.
  
  In a small bowl, beat the eggs with 1/2 cup of the cheese. Reduce the
  heat to low so that the soup is no longer simmering, and very slowly
  ladle about 2 cups of the hot soup into the beaten eggs, whisking
  constantly. Once incorporated, gradually stir the egg mixture into
  the soup in the saucepan. Increase the heat to moderately low and
  cook the soup, whisking constantly, until it just thickens, about 8
  minutes. Do not allow the soup to boil or the eggs will curdle.
  Remove from the heat.
  
  Place one slide of toasted bread into each soup bowl.  Ladle the hot
  soup on top and serve with additional grated cheese.
  
  Note:  Thickening soup with bread is typical of rustic Italian
  cooking, in which nothing goes to waste.  The toasts may be made from
  day-old or slightly stale bread.  Serve with a Sauvignon Blanc.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
      4 c  Chicken broth
      1 tb Plus 2 teaspoons nuoc mam
           -(Vietnamese fish sauce)
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      6    Shallots, chopped

      2 tb Cornstarch or arrowroot,

  This soup was probably created by some homesick Frenchman.  White asparagus
  (a French import), packed in jars or cans, is used for this recipe.
  Traditionally, crumbled, salted duck egg yolk is added to season the soup.
  
  If white asparagus is unavailable, use frozen or fresh asparagus (in this
  case, add the fresh asparagus to the broth from the very beginning and cook
  until tender, before adding the remaining ingredients).
  
  Combine the broth, 1 tablespoon of the fish sauce, the sugar and salt in a

      Title: Asparagus & Mushrooms with Black Bean Sauce
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Asparagus, stiff ends
           Peeled
    1/4 lb Brown button mushrooms (or
           Mixed mushrooms)
      2    Garlic cloves
      1 tb Fermented black soybeans
  1 1/2 tb Rice vinegar
      1 tb Tamari (or soy sauce)
      1 ts Potato starch (or
           Cornstarch)
      1 ts Brown sugar
      1 tb Sake or other rice wine
 
  Cut asparagus on the diagonal into 1-2 inch pieces. Blanch for 5 minutes in
  boiling water.  Drain and set aside.
  
  Wash and slice mushrooms. Set aside.
  
  Mince the garlic. Rinse the black beans well.  Mix garlic and beans
  together. Set aside.
  
  Mix together the rice vinegar, tamari, starch, sugar, and sake. Set aside.
  
  Fill a glass with water and set handy next to the stove. Put a skillet over
  high heat.  When the pan is hot, dump the garlic mixture into the pan. Stir
  fry for one minute, adding water as the mixture begins to stick -- add just
  a little at time.  Add the asparagus and stir fry for 10 minutes (or until
  asparagus is just shy of being crisp-done), again adding water just as
  needed.  Add mushrooms and stir fry for 2-5 more minutes. Add the vinegar
  mixture (giving it a last stir to make sure starch is well mixed), stir
  until evenly coated and sauce thickens. Serve immediately.
  
  Comments:
  
  Fermented black soybeans are available in Asian markets. Usually labled
  "salted black beans".  I find them in the preserved food section in plastic
  bags.

      Title: Asparagus & Sesame Chicken Soup
 Categories: Chinese, Poultry, Soups/stews
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Chicken
      3 tb Sesame oil
      6    Slices ginger root
    1/2 c  Medium sherry
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Warm water
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2 c  Button mushrooms, canned
      8    Fresh asparagus spears
 
  Preparation:  Rinse chicken, remove fat pockets, pat dry, and chop into
  bite-size pieces.  NOTE:  if tempted to use breast meat without bones,
  please don`t; bones add to body and flavor of soup. Peel and slice ginger
  root.  Wash and cut asparagus into 2" sections.
  
  Braising:  Heat wok to medium hot.  Add sesame oil. Start braising chicken
  a few pieces at a time when oil begins to smell. Sesame oil will burn at
  lower temperature than other cooking oils, so avoid hot wok. After browning
  lightly, return chicken pieces to wok; add ginger slices, sherry and salt.
  When sherry boils, add water and sugar. Turn up heat, bring to boil, then
  reduce heat to simmer, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Add mushrooms and
  asparagus, simmer for another 15 minutes.
  
  Transfer to covered soup tureen (or put plate on top of soup bowl), place
  in steamer on low, and hold until ready to serve.
  
  You can make this soup in large sauce pan, if wok is needed for something
  else.

      Title: Asparagus with Blue Cheese - Gghol
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Asparagus; cleaned
      2 ts Red wine vinegar
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Chives; minced
      4 tb Blue cheese; crumbled
           White pepper; freshly ground
 
  Snap ends off asparagus spears.  Fill medium skillet with 1-inch water and
  bring to a boil.  Add asparagus in single layer and cook 8 to 10 minutes or
  until tender. Drain well and arrange on a serving plate. Stir together
  vinegar and oil in sm bowl.  Add blue cheese and chives and mix well. Pour
  over hot asparagus. Season to taste with plenty of white pepper. Set aside
  until tepid, then serve.
  
  Hint on cleaning asparagus:  Hold the bottom end of the stem in one hand
  and gently bend the stalk with the other. The stalk will break where it is
  tender, thus giving you a piece of asparagus that is entirely edible. With
  a little practice you will know exactly where to break the vegetable. Save
  the broken-off ends for soups. Slice and add to soup stock, then drain and
  discard the coarse stalks before serving.

      Title: Asparagus with Hazelnut Butter
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Cooked Asparagus
      1 oz Finely Ground Hazelnuts
      2 tb Butter
      2 ts Cider Vinegar
           Salt And Pepper To Taste
 
  Wash asparagus under cold running water.  Snap off lower end of each stalk
  with your fingers.  Let the stalk break where it wants to, this will leave
  only the tender portion of the stalk.  Young tender asparagus can be cooked
  in a steamer for 5-7 minutes, the more mature stalks for 7-10 minutes. Do
  not over cook asparagus, it will lose flavor and nutrients if over cooked.
  At the same time, place the hazelnuts and butter in a small heavy skillet.
  Heat until the butter melts and mix thoroughly. Remove from heat and stir
  in vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour hazelnut butter over
  hot asparagus. Serve at once. From: Syd's Cookbook.

  are all prepared in the same way.
  
  "Rub off the fuzz (or, for some ferns, the scaly coating) of the young,
  crisp fronds, wash them and place them, lying flat, in a saucepan or
  skillet with a small amount of boiling salted water. Bring water again to a
  boil.  Turn to low heat, cover and simmer for 10 to 20 minutes, or until
  fronds are just tender (time will depend on the size and kind of fronds)."
  
  Season with butter, salt and pepper to taste, or serve with lemon juice of
  any sauce suitable for asparagus.

  mozzerella at one end of each breast. Lay one (or two if they'll fit side
  by side) asparagus length on top, cross-wise Roll the breast up and secure
  with toothpicks...you should have a bundle of chicken rolled cylindrically
  around the spear (e.g. like paper towels on a cardboard roll). The
  mozzerella should be at the center ONLY, not distributed throughout the
  roll. Repeat for all breasts.
  
  Saute the breast-rolls in a LIGHTLY oiled frypan (as little as you can get
  	away with) until browned. Pour Marinara Sauce over it all and simmer until
  the chicken is cooked 	thoroughly. Stir occasionally to keep from sticking.
  Serve over Rice or pasta.......WARN your guests about the toothpicks!

      1 ts Cornstarch; blended with
    1/4 c  Chicken broth
 
  POUND THE CHICKEN BREASTS as you would for scaloppine, then slice them
  crosswise at 1/2-inch intervals. Marinate chicken for 30 minutes at room
  temperature in a mixture of the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, port and 1
  tablespoon of the sesame oil. Trim the coarse stem ends from the asparagus.
  Peel the asparagus and slice them crosswise, slightly on the diagonal, into
  1-inch lengths. Peel and halve the onion, then cut each half into thin
  slices. Core, seed and slice the red bell pepper lengthwise into 1/4-inch
  strips. Set a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add the chili oil and 1
  tablespoon of the remaining sesame oil and heat the oil for about 1 minute,
  until ripples appear on the wok bottom. Add the onion and red pepper and
  stir-fry the mixture for 1 minute. Cover the wok and allow the mixture to
  steam for 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, remove the vegetables from the
  wok to a heatproof plate. Add the remaining sesame oil to the wok, pour in
  the chicken and marinade, and stir-fry over high heat for 2 minutes. Blend
  in the cornstarch mixture, stirring it for about 1 minute, until the sauce
  has thickened and becomes clear. Return the vegetables to the wok, toss the
  mixture lightly for about 30 seconds, and serve. Accompany the chicken with
  fluffy boiled rice.

 Categories: Meats, Breads, Vegetables, Chinese
      Yield: 2 servings
 
           Beef, loin

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
           Asparagus, fresh
           Mushrooms, Inoki
           Mushrooms, Shitake,
           Onions, green

---------------------------MARINADE FOR THE BEEF---------------------------
      1 ts Wine, rice
      1 ts Soy sauce
      1 lg Egg white
      1 ds Ginger, ground
      1 ds Cornstarch
      1 ds Garlic, minced
      1 ds Pepper, black

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
      2 tb Teriyaki sauce
      2 tb Broth
 
  Preparation: ============
  
   Cook the asparagus by boiling, steaming, stir-frying or microwaving until
  it's tender.  (The whole spear with the tough end cut off should be kept
  whole.) Steaming takes 2 to 3 minutes. Stir-frying 1 to 2 and so on. Use
  whatever method you prefer.
  
   Prepare the marinade for the beef by mixing all of the ingredients well
  and setting them aside.
  
   Prepare some braising sauce for the cooking and set aside.
  
   Slice your beef loin into very thin slices.  Put them in a small baking
  dish or shallow bowl and cover with marinade ingredients. Stir well to mix
  and set in a refrigerator for ten minutes or more.
  
  Cooking: ========
  
   Take one of the marinated slices of beef and "fill" it with some Inoki
  mushroom, some Shitake mushroom, a little green onion, and steamed
  asparagus and roll the beef.  Use a toothpick to secure the meat.
  
   Brown in a little peanut oil (two rolls per person as a serving).
  
   Add the braising sauce (Teriyaki and broth) and cover, cooking over medium
  heat for three to four minutes until done.
  
   Serve rolls with cooked rice, and garnish with drippings from the pan and
  some Inoki mushrooms.

      Title: Fresh Asparagus with Lemon Butter Sauce
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Asparagus, Fresh
    1/4 lb Butter
      3 tb Lemon Juice, Concentrate
      1 tb Parsley, Chopped
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Tabasco Sauce
 
  Select fresh asparagus for crispness and young tender pencil sized stalks
  are ideal. Wash asparagus under cold running water. Snap off the lower end
  of each stalk with your fingers. Let the stalk break where it wants to.
  This will leave only the tender portion of the asparagus. Young tender
  stalks can be cooked in a steamer for 5-7 minutes, the more mature stalks
  for 7-10 minutes. DO NOT OVERCOOK asparagus. It will lose flavor and
  nutrients if overcooked. Prior to cooking the asparagus, prepare the lemon
  butter sauce. This is enough sauce for 1 to 1-1/2 pounds of asparagus.
  Combine the butter, lemon juice, parsley, salt and Tabasco Sauce in a small
  saucepan and heat until hot. DO NOT BOIL. Pour the heated sauce over the
  cooked asparagus and serve. From: Syd's Cookbook.

           Watermelon
 
  In the name of sportsmanship, let's consider one more way to look at fruits
  and vegetables.  "According to L.H. Bailey, a vegetable is in horticultural
  usage, an edible herbaceous plant or part thereof that is commonly used for
  culinary purposes.  In common usage, the fruits of the tomato, cucumber,
  squash, etc., are considered as vegetables, grown with other vegetables in
  the home garden, although of course each one is a seed bearing organ and
  hence, under strict usage of the language, might be considered a fruit." It
  is also as popularaly understodd, any plant cultivated for its edible
  parts.  This loose definition includes roots (beet and carrot), tubers
  (potato), stems (celery), leaves (lettuce), flower buds and heads
  (cauliflower), fruits (tomato), and seeds (peas, beans, corn).
  
  Looking back to the list, we can easily slip into familiar habits:
  artichoke, asparagus, avocado, bean, beet, broccoli, brussels sprouts,
  cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, celery, corn, cucumber, eggplant, lettuce,
  onion, parsnip, pea, pepper, potato, radish, squash, and tomato are
  vegetables, all the others are fruits.
  
  In other words, if you call it a vegetable, and your neighbour calls it a
  vegetable, and your local grocer calls it a vegetable, then it must be a
  vegetable.  You like the sound of this?  Fine with us.  And, deep in our
  hearts, we suspect that's the best way to play, according to Hoyle.

  family member that don't like cooked carrots, like these cook carrots. Also
  we just nuked in the mircowave stove for about 10 minutes. The lemon juice
  and the lemon pepper really did make a nice change for us. (are tryig hard
  to cut back on the fat.) Used fresh asparagus.

  slotted spatula to the bowl with the vinegar mixture.
  
  In fresh boiling water, cook remaining asparagus with the rest of the salt.
  Transfer to the bowl with the vinegar mixture.  Toss gently until spears
  are evenly coated.
  
  Place asparagus on a serving plate.  Sprinkle evenly with cheese.  Makes 8
  servings.
  
  For a more sophisticated look, try shaving the cheese witha vegetable parer
  instead of grating it.  If you like, garnish th platter with fresh orange
  sections.

      Title: Potato Crepes with Scallops Salmon & Asparagus
 Categories: Pancakes
      Yield: 2 servings
 
    1/2 lb Fresh asparagus
      1 tb Dry white wine
    1/2 ts Cornstarch
      1    Egg white
    1/8 ts White pepper
    1/4 lb Scallops
    1/4 lb Salmon filet
           Potato crepes (see recipe)
  1 1/2 c  Peanut oil
      1 ts Minced fresh ginger
      1 tb Minced green onion
    1/8 ts White pepper
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
      2 ts Soy sauce
    1/2 ts Rice vinegar
    1/4 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Cornstarch dissolved in 1
           -teaspoon water
 
  Starting at the tip end, cut the asparagus into 1 1/2-inch lengths with a
  diagonal rolling cut:  slice off the tip at an angle, roll the asparagus
  about a quarter turn and cut again, and repeat on down the stalk until you
  reach the tougher base.  Discard the bases.  Dissolve the cornstarch in the
  wine in a medium bowl; add the egg white and pepper and beat lightly.
  Remove the tough white muscle from the edge of each scallop and cut the
  scallops into 1/4-inch-thick discs. Remove any pin bones from the salmon
  and slice across the width of the slice (parallel to the backbone) into
  1/4-inch-thick rectangles. Add the salmon and scallops to the egg mixture
  and toss gently to coat. Preheat the oven to 175F and set 2 dinner plates
  in it to warm. Prepare the Potato Crepes and place 1 on each plate. Keep
  warm in the oven. Have a clean, dry, heatproof container, such as a
  saucepan, on the stove with a heat proof sieve on top. Drain the scallops
  and salmon and discard the marinade. Heat a wok or deep skillet over high
  heat. When it begins to smoke, add the oil. Wait 30 seconds, then add the
  seafood (the oil will not be very hot yet; this is intentional). Cook,
  stirring gently to separate the pieces, until salmon has lost its raw
  color.  Pour the contents of the wok into the sieve. Return the wok to the
  heat, and in the bit of oil clinging to the pan, stir-fry the ginger and
  green onion until fragrant.  Add the pepper and asparagus and stir-fry
  until it begins to brown.  Add the chicken stock, soy sauce, vinegar and
  sugar.  Cover, and cook until the asparagus is crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes
  depending on size.  Remove the cover, return the seafood to the wok, and
  stir in the cornstarch mixture. Cook until the sauce is slightly thickened.
  Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary, then divide the seafood,
  asparagus and sauce over the potato crepes. Serve immediately Serves 2.

      Title: Quail Breasts & Truffle Salad
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Herb vinaigrette (see below)
           Truffle juice vinaigrette
           -(see below)
     32    Asparagus tips
     50 g  Chanterelles   (cleaned)
     12 qt Breasts
      1    Or 2 uncooked yellow
           -zucchini (sliced into 48
           -very thin circles)
      1 lg Tomato (brunoised)
     15 g  Frisee lettuce (cleaned)
     12    Italian parsley leaves
     30 g  Truffle (sliced into 12
           -very thin circles)
           Butter
           Seasoning - salt, pepper,
           -chicken stock
           White wine
 
  The remaining recipes are Western and somewhat Frenchified to my eyes.
  They're "nouveaux" at the very least.  Little dabs of food artfully
  arranged here and there on a plate, sometimes connected by skeins of
  sauces.  Expensive too.  This one calls for chanterelles and 30 grams of
  truffles, a little over an ounce.
  
  Establishment: The Regent Hotel (Hong Kong) Salisbury Road, Tsimshatsui,
  Kowloon. Western Cuisine Practical Class Gold Award - Hors d'oeuvre Chef:
  Patrick Lin (The Regent Hotel)
  
  To prepare: 1. Make herb vinaigrette from onion, chives, Italian parsley,
  parsley and a pinch of tarragon, all finely chopped together. (Keep some
  chopped herbs aside to use in chanterelles preparation - see below.) Add
  salt, pepper, walnut oil, sherry and vinegar, according to taste.
  
  2.  Make truffle juice vinaigrette from bottled truffle juice, salt, olive
  oil and vinegar.  (For both vinaigrettes recommended ratio of oil to
  vinegar is 2:1.)
  
  3.  Cut asparagus tips off stems with slanting cuts (so that they will
  stand up at an angle in central garnish.)
  
  To cook: 1. Lightly salt chanterelles and saute over a low flame in butter,
  with a drop of white wine, a few drops of chicken stock, and a mixture of
  the same herbs that were used to make herb vinaigrette (see above).
  
  2.  Reduce sauteed mixture completely, and then marinate chanterelles in
  herb vinaigrette for 30 minutes.
  
  3.  Clean quail breasts and season with salt and pepper.  In a restaurant
  kitchen they would be grilled - for home cooking, pan-fry in hot melted
  butter quickly for about one minute top and bottom until they are golden
  brown all over.
  
  To present: 1. Create central garnish by arranging a wheel of eleven
  overlapping yellow zucchini slices, placing a small heap of tomato brunoise
  on one central slice.  Place asparagus tips pointing outwards from centre.
  
  2.  Create three distinct islands of chanterelles topped with frisee
  lettuce and Italian parsley.  Place three truffle slices between
  chanterelle islands and lay one quail breast on each.  Pour a little
  truffle juice vinaigrette over quails and central garnish, and a little
  herb vinaigrette over lettuce.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: Springtime Asparagus Salad
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Asparagus, peeled *
    1/2 c  Olive oil
    1/4 c  White wine vinegar
    1/2 ts Dijon mustard
      1 lg Clove garlic, crushed
           Salt and ground pepper
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
        ds Tabasco sauce
    1/2 c  Chopped onion
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
    1/2 c  Parmesan cheese
      3 tb Pine nuts,toasted(see below)
 
  1.  Steam the asparagus spears for 5 minutes.  Drain well and place in a
  serving dish.
  
  2.  In a bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar, Dijon, garlic, salt,
  pepper, Worcestershire, Tabasco, onion, parsley, and Parmesan.  Stir in the
  pine nuts.
  
  3.  Pour the vinaigrette over the asparagus.  Cover and let marinate in the
  refrigerator 6 to 8 hours or overnight.  Serve chilled with the marinade
  spooned over the spears.
  
  6 portions
  
  * I always peel asparagus, as the stalk can be quite tough, especially on
  mature asparagus.  If you purchase the pencil thin asparagus, it is not
  necessary to peel them, as they are generally quite tender.
  
  HOW TO TOAST NUTS
  
  Spread nuts out on a cookie sheet and bake in a 350F degree oven for 5 to
  10 minutes until golden. Different sizes and types of nuts toast at varying
  times; the smaller the nut, the faster it browns, so you have to keep a
  watchful eye on the oven.
