      Title: Creamy Coconut Cake
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 10 servings
 
--------------------------------FOR THE CAKE--------------------------------
  2 1/2 c  All purpose flour               2 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt                                1 c  Butter, softened
      2 c  Granulated sugar                    4    Eggs
      1 c  Milk                                1 ts Vanilla

------------------------------FOR THE FILLING------------------------------
      8 oz Whipped cream, stiff              1/2 c  Coconut
    1/4 c  Confectioners sugar                 1 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Chopped walnuts               

------------------------------FOR THE FROSTING------------------------------
      2 pk 3 oz ea cream cheese, soft          4 c  Confectioners sugar
      2 tb Butter, softened                    1 c  Chopped walnuts
      2 ts Vanilla                             1 pk 8 oz coconut
 
  1. Preheat oven to 350F. Grease (and flour if you wish) 3 nine (9") inch
  round pans. Mix flour with baking powder and 1/2 ts salt. In a large bowl,
  mixed at high speed beat the butter and 2 cups of sugar until light. Add 4
  eggs, one at a time, and beat after each time you add one.
  
  2. Continue beating, occasionally scraping bowl with rubber scraper, until
  fluffy - about 2 minutes. At low speed, beat in flour mixture, in fourths
  alternating with milk (in thirds) beginning and ending with the flour mix.
  Add vanilla. Beat until just smooth, about 1 min.
  
  3. Pour into prepared pans, and bake for 25-30 min., or until sur- face
  springs back when lightly touched. Cool pans on wire racks 10 minutes.
  Remove from pans and cool thoroughly.
  
  4. Prepare the filling: simply whip the cream, adding the sugar and
  vanilla, and keep cool until the cake has cooled completely.
  
  5. Make the frosting: cream the cream cheese and sugar together, (both
  should be soft), then add the sugar and vanilla. You might need to add a
  little milk to make it to the consistency you like.
  
  6. When everything is cool and ready, place a layer on the plate you will
  serve it from, top side down. Fill with whipped cream filling, and sprinkle
  with coconut and if you would like add chopped walnuts. Repeat with the
  second layer, and then place the top layer on. Frost the sides and the top.
  Cover the entire cake with coconut and if you wish, add chopped
  walnuts.Refrigerate to set the frosting.
  
  NOTE: I had to use skewers to hold the cake in place while I was frosting
  it, and it might be a good idea to use these to prevent the cake from
  sliding.

  ingredients. Then add the rest of the meat and let marinate overnight in

  If you charcoal the meat over a grill or open fire, baste with the marinade
  each time you turn, and the meat will form a marinade crust. It's great.

      8 tb Butter(1 stick)soft                      Finely chopped
    1/2 c  Light Brown Sugar               1 3/4 c  Flour
      2 tb Orange Peel Grated                       Glaze:
    1/4 ts Salt                            1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
      1    Egg                                 2 tb Orange Juice
      1 oz Semisweet Chocolate,very            4 tb Lemon Juice
 
  Cream butter, sugar, orange peel, and salt in the mixer at high speed for 1
  to 2 minutes, untill light and fluffy. Add the egg and beat 1 minute more
  at medium speed. Add the chocolate and the flour and beat at low speed just
  enough to combine. Divide the dough, flatten each half into a 6-inch
  circle, wrap in plastic wrap and chill for at least 2 hours or, better yet,
  overnight. When ready to proceed, preheat oven to 375 F. Roll out each
  circle of dough, one at a time, between sheets of lightly flowered waxed
  paper until scant 1/4 inch thick, sprinkle with flour once during rolling.
  Carefully pel off the top piece of paper and, using 2 1/2 inch round
  cutters, cut the dough-still on the bottom sheet of wax paper- into rounds
  but do not lift from paper. Slide the paper of dough on a cookiesheet and
  set in the freezer for 5 minutes. Than use small spatula to remove the
  cookies and space 1 inch apart on a lightly greased baking sheet. Bake the
  cookies in the middle of the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until lightly
  browned on the edges. Transfer at once to wire racks. For the glaze: whisk
  the powdered sugar with the juices until smooth. Using pasrty brush, brush
  the glaze on the still warm cookies. As soon as glaze is hard you can store
  them with waxpaper between the layers in airtight containers.

      Title: Orangenplaetzchen
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      8 tb Butter(1 stick)soft                      Finely chopped
    1/2 c  Light Brown Sugar               1 3/4 c  Flour
      2 tb Orange Peel Grated                       Glaze:
    1/4 ts Salt                            1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
      1    Egg                                 2 tb Orange Juice
      1 oz Semisweet Chocolate,very            4 tb Lemon Juice
 
  Cream butter, sugar, orange peel, and salt in the mixer at high speed for 1
  to 2 minutes, untill light and fluffy. Add the egg and beat 1 minute more
  at medium speed. Add the chocolate and the flour and beat at low speed just
  enough to combine. Divide the dough, flatten each half into a 6-inch
  circle, wrap in plastic wrap and chill for at least 2 hours or, better yet,
  overnight. When ready to proceed, preheat oven to 375 F. Roll out each
  circle of dough, one at a time, between sheets of lightly flowered waxed
  paper until scant 1/4 inch thick, sprinkle with flour once during rolling.
  Carefully pel off the top piece of paper and, using 2 1/2 inch round
  cutters, cut the dough-still on the bottom sheet of wax paper- into rounds
  but do not lift from paper. Slide the paper of dough on a cookiesheet and
  set in the freezer for 5 minutes. Than use small spatula to remove the
  cookies and space 1 inch apart on a lightly greased baking sheet. Bake the
  cookies in the middle of the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until lightly
  browned on the edges. Transfer at once to wire racks. For the glaze: whisk
  the powdered sugar with the juices until smooth. Using pasrty brush, brush
  the glaze on the still warm cookies. As soon as glaze is hard you can store
  them with waxpaper between the layers in airtight containers.

      Title: Grilled Country Ribs From George Fassett
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 servings

      1 c  Vegetable oil                     3/4 ts Bell's seasoning

    1/2 ts Black pepper                  

------------------------------FOILED POTATOES------------------------------
      5 md Potatoes                            1 sm Onion, halved and sl
    1/4    Stick of butter                          Salt & Pepper to tas
    1/2 ts Parsley                                  Veg. shortening
      1    Clove garlic, chopped          
 
  Marinating the Ribs:
  
  Place country pork rib slices in a large container, such as a
  tupperware-type with a tight-fitting lid, add all ingredients for marinade.
  Cover and shake vigorously to mix.  Refrigerate, overnight best but a few
  hours at the least.  This is an adaptation to the class "Fireman's Field
  Days" marinade.
  
  Preparing the potatoes:
  
  Spread out two 3 ft. sheets of heavy duty aluminum foil, splic together to
  form one wide one.  Rub vegetable shortening on center 2/3 of foil to
  prevent sticking.  Slice potatoes, skin still on, onto foil food processor
  works wonders..).  Season potato slices with remainder ingredients, slice
  butter over top.    Carefully draw sides of foil together and crimp (don't
  pull apart seam on bottom!) and then roll up ends.
  
  Cooking:
  
  Get grill hot, place foil potatoes over high heat and cook for to 20 min.,
  then move to low-heat area, upper shelf, or keep warm in oven. (Check
  potatoes by unrolling top a bit and they should be soft, bottom layer
  browned well.)
  
  Keeping grill hot, lay out pork slices from marinade and grill Adjust temp
  for flaming/burning, not letting them fire or char.  Turn baste, letting
  marinade cook on top of meat before turning again.  The egg congeals on the
  hot surface of the ribs and helps to coat the ribs Continue turning and
  basting every few minutes until all marinade is g approx. 30-40 minutes.
  Cut into thickest part of a slice and check fo doneness - there should be
  no pink.  The object of turning and basting to build up a coating of the
  cooked marinade on the meat, almost like crust. Meat will have a
  well-cooked appearance but should not be char black (don't let flames
  ignite marinade and burn it).
  
  Serve foil potatoes hot from foil (mmm, get the crispy ones on bottom, like
  potato chips!) and dive into the ribs.  Add your favorite vegetable or corn
  on the cob for a great meal, any time of the year!

      Title: Anise - Fennel
 Categories: Spices/etc.
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lg Stalks anise (fennel)               1 c  Sliced fresh mushrooms
      1    Clove garlic, quartered             1 c  Chopped fresh tomatoes
      2 tb Olive oil                         1/3 c  Beef stock or bouillon
      3 tb Butter                            1/2 ts Sweet basil
 
  There is a bit of confusion about these two plants.  For some reason,the
  fennel plant, which resembles celery with fern like tops, has been called
  sweet anise in produce markets.  The true anise is cultivated only for its
  seeds. So what you see labelled "sweet anise" in  your market is probably
  fennel, but no matter what you call it, this is a highly interesting
  vegetable.  Every part of this aromatic plant has a taste and aroma similar
  to licorice.  The stems are eaten like celery,uncook, or cooked and served
  as a vegetable (heavenly with apples in waldorf salad) Available from
  September to May.
  
  HOW TO CHOOSE AND STORE:  Choose fennel the same way you do celery, with
  crisp stalks and fresh leaves.  Wash and store in vegetable crisper or
  plastic bag in refrigerator.
  
  BASIC PREPARATION: Trim the ferny tops and remove tough outer stalks. Cut
  off heavy base.  Slice the stalks in thin lengthwise strips.  Wash,drain
  and cook in boiling, salted water or bouillon until just tender,15-20
  minutes.  Drain and add melted butter, salt and pepper and serve.

      Yield: 12 servings
 
      4 kg Pitted, very ripe apricots               Juice of 1 lemon
           -(8 lbs 12 oz)                  1 1/2 pk "Einsiedehilfe" ('Preserving
  3 1/4 kg Sugar (7 lbs)                            -Aid') dissolved in
 
  hot water
  
  Cook apricots and sugar to setting point, continually skimming off foam.
  Shortly before done, add lemon juice.  Remove from heat. Stir in
  'Preserving Aid' dissolved in hot water.  Pour into hot, dry, sterilized
  jars. Seal jars with cellophane the top of which has been dipped in rum and
  smooth the overhang over the jars' necks, tying with thin twine.
  
  Makes 12 half-liter jars and one quarter-liter jar.  (Between 13 and 14 1
  pint jars).
  
  "Einsiedehilfe" ('Preserving Aid') is sold (in Austria) in 15 gram packages

  To test for setting point:  Spoon a little of the conserve onto a chilled
  saucer. Leave for a few minutes - then hold saucer upside down. If conserve
  doesn't run, then setting point has been reached.

  nectarines, and pears work equally well.  Any fresh green chile can also be
  substituted, depending on your heat preference.  Serranos will make it
  hotter; roasted, peeled New Mexican chiles will tame it down."

      Title: Beard's Beer Batter
 Categories: Toppings
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2    Eggs, separated                   3/4 c  Beer, room temperature
      2 tb Vegetable oil                     3/4 c  Flour
  1 1/2 tb Salt                           
 
  The ultimate batter for deep frying... DIRECTIONS:
  
  BEER!  Whether it's ale, lager, pilsener, or stout, is terrific for
  cooking. Beer makes a batter for deep frying and smooths a French onion
  soup.  And what could be more compatible for lunch on a rainy Vancouver
  weekend out on the boat fishing for Spring salmon than a cold beer with a
  hot pastrami sandwich smothered with brown beer mustard?
  
  This is the late James Beard's recipe for batter to French fry vegetables.
  Trim your veggies, wash, dry thoroughly, dust with flour, dip into the
  batter, and fry in oil at 360 F. until done.  However, James "missed the
  boat" on this one - it's far better for deep frying halibut, cod, or any
  other seafood.  The batter puffs up because of the beer's yeast, fries
  quickly, and as a result, doesn't commit the cardinal sin of seafood
  preparation - overcooking.  I think few of our piscine friends benefit from
  deep frying as a cooking method, but that's another story.
  
  To prepare, place flour in a mixing bowl and add egg yolks, salt, oil, and
  beer.  Stir batter until thoroughly mixed.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap
  and allow it to rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours or as long as 24 -
  the longer the better, to a point.  Just before using batter, stir it well
  again.  In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until stiff but not dry; gently
  fold egg whites into batter.  Does 2 lbs. of veggies or 6 fish fillets,
  depending upon their size.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      2 c  Cranberries, fresh                       -taste
 
  Serves 4
  
  *DIRECTIONS*
  
  Heat oil in a large skillet. Add beef and brown on all sides. Add onions
  and celery and saute until golden brown. Add garlic and saute mixture 1
  minute longer, stirring constantly. (Do not let garlic change color.)
  
  Stir water into mixture, then add remaining ingredients. Cover and simmer
  for 1-1/4 hours, or until beef is tender and liquid is reduced to 1/3 to
  1/2 cup. If pan juice gets too low during cooking, add a little hot water.
  Or, if pan juice does not reduce sufficiently, uncover skillet during last
  30 minutes of cooking and stir often. Taste to correct seasonings. Stew
  goes well with brown rice. Makes 4 servings.

      8 oz Dried black beans                   2 cl Garlic
      1    Water                                    Stems from 1 bunch of
      1    Bay leaf                                 -cilantro (fresh coriander)
      1    Ham hock                                 Salt and freshly ground
      2    Jalapeno peppers, seeded                 -pepper (optional)
 
  1.  Rinse and drain the beans thoroughly.  Place them in a large saucepan
  or soup kettle, and add all the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil,
  then reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1-1/2 hours. 2. Remove and
  discard the ham hock and bay leaf.  Using a slotted spoon, transfer the
  bean mixture, in batches, to the bowl of a food processor. Process, adding
  cooking liquid as necessary to form a smooth, thick paste. You will use a
  total of about 1 cup liquid. 3. Transfer the pesto to a bowl and stir in
  the salt and pepper, if needed. Refrigerate, covered, until ready to use.

  Raw cleaned calf's feet chopped up, put to boil in cold water with a stick
  of cinnamon and the rind of a lemon, boiled till soft, and the liquor well
  reduced, strain, allowed to get cold, then all fat and skimmings removed,
  the liquor which should have become like jelly then put back into a bright
  kettle with some beaten whites of eggs, sugar to taste, little white wine
  and lemon juice, brought slowly to the boil without stirring, then allowed
  to simmer till the coagulation turns a grey color, about twenty minutes ,
  then strained and restrained through a jelly bag; when nearly cool, filled
  into glasses or molds, and served when set and cold.
  
  **The hoof is split with a knife, then treated the same as calf's head;
  when done, the bones removed, and the meat pressed between boards.
  
  The quantities are estimates only.

    1/3 c  All purpose flour              
 
  Remove stem end from beans; cut beans into 1 inch lengths.  There should be
  about 8 cups. In a large pot of rapidly boiling water, cook beans, about
  1/3 at a time, until tender-crunchy, about 3 minutes. As each batch cooks,
  transfer immediately to large bowl of cold water to chill. Blanch peppers
  and onions in similar way, boiling peppers for 1 minute and onions for 2
  minutes.  Drain thoroughly. In a medium bowl, blend tumeric, mustard, flour
  and salt into sugar. Stir in cold water to make a smooth paste. In a large
  heavy preserving kettle, combine vinegar and celery and mustard seeds;
  bring to boil. Stir in about 1 cup of spiced vinegar into mustard paste,
  then whisk mustard past into spiced vinegar in saucepan. Cook over medium
  heat, whisking constantly until sauce is smooth. Reduce heat and simmer
  uncovered, for 5 minutes.  Pour drained vegetables into sauce; mix well and
  return to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 4 - 5 minutes or until vegetables
  are tender.  Ladle into hot sterilized jars leaving 1/8 inch head space.
  Seal.  I prefer to process these in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes for
  1/2 pint jars and 15 minutes for pint jars. Makes about 9 cups.

      Title: Dandelion Jelly
 Categories: Toppings, Preserve
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 qt Dandelion blossoms              1 3/4 oz Powdered fruit pectin
      2 qt Water                           5 1/2 c  Sugar
      2 tb Fresh lemon juice              
 
  Pick bright, fresh dandelion blossoms and pack the quart container pretty
  tightly.  This is going to require a lot of dandelion blossoms!  Rinse
  quickly in cold water to remove any insects/dirt on the petals.  Don't
  leave the blossoms in the water for very long though, as they will be a
  little the worse for wear.
  
  Next, pull up a chair somewhere comfortable, as this part is going to take
  awhile...Snip off the stem and green collar under each blossom, so that
  only the petals are left. This takes about four hours!
  
  In an enamel saucepan, boil the dandelion petals in water for 3 minutes, or
  a little longer, until the water takes on their color.  (I boiled the
  petals for 4 minutes until I liked the color better.)
  
  Cool and strain, pressing against the petals with your fingers to extract
  all of the dandelion juice.  (Or you can cheat and line a sieve with
  moistened cheesecloth and strain it that way.)
  
  Measure out 3 cups of dandelion liquid.  Add the lemon juice and fruit
  pectin.  Stir to combine.
  
  Bring to a boil, using a large kettle.  Add the sugar, stirring to mix
  well. Continue stirring and boil the mixture for 2 and 1/2 minutes.
  
  Pour into hot sterilized jelly jars and seal.  Process for five minutes in
  a boiling water bath.
  
  Yield:  Five 1/2 pint jars.

 Categories: Spices/etc.
      Yield: 14 servings
 
     12    Med-skinned oranges or                   -lemons
 
  Makes 1/4 c powdered orange peel or 1/8 c powdered lemon peel
  
  a cheese or vegetable grater
  
  Use the coarse side of a cheese grater to grate off the citrus skin in
  strips; use only the orange (or yellow) part of the skin avoiding the
  bitter white part.  Spread the peel strips on two ceramic plates and let
  dry, uncovered, at room temperature, for 3 to 4 days.  When the peels
  become brittle and shriveled, store them in a small glass jar.
  
  To use:  Whirl the whole dried peels in a blender or food processor until
  powdered, or use a mortar or pestle.  The strong citrus oil will stay
  within the dry peels and will be released fully upon powdering. Use whole
  dried orange peel in tea blends and to perk up hot chocolate. Use powdered
  orange or lemon peel in place of extract in baking; also in toppings, to
  flavor sugar-bowl sugar and to flavor honey, duck, and barbecue sauces.

 Categories: Condiment, Preserve
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      2 lb Of eggplant                     1 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
      4 c  Of sugar (2 pounds)                      Juice of 2 large lemons
      4 c  Of water                                 Grated rind of 1/2 lemon
      1 ts Ground nutmeg                  
 
  Makes about 8 half-pints
  
  Wash, peel and dice the eggplant.  Barely cover with water in a preserving
  kettle and boil for about 10 minutes; drain and set aside.  Make a syrup by
  combining the sugar, water, nutmeg and cinnamon and bringing them to a
  boil.  Add the eggplant.  Remove from heat, cover and allow to stand
  overnight.  The next day, remove the eggplant with a slotted spoon and boil
  the syrup for 20 minutes to thicken it.  Return the eggplant to the kettle
  and boil for 30 to 40 minutes until the syrup sheets when dropped from a
  spoon (2 drops forming on the edge of the spoon, coming together and
  falling as 1 drop), or until a jelly thermometer reads 220 to 222 F.  Stir
  in the lemon juice and grated rind. Ladle into hot, sterilized jars and
  seal.
  
  To seal:  Fill to within 1/2-inch head room, being sure to first wipe the
  rim and threads of the jars with a hot damp cloth to remove all particles
  of food, seeds or spices.  While contents are hot, cover with a 1/8-inch
  layer of paraffin.  When paraffin has set, add another layer of melted
  paraffin, tilting and rotating the jar to seal completely.

      Title: Fermented or Brined Pickles
 Categories: Pickles
      Yield: 6 servings
 
     10    Percent brine solution made              -2 quarts
           -by dissolving 1 cup salt in   
 
  "Pickle making begins with the brine and to make carelessly or to maintain
  carelessly a brine is the reason for most of the soft and unfit pickles.
  
  Remember these key points; Use clean stone or glass jars; use only a
  recommended pickling variety of cucumbers; use only canning and pickling
  salt; and do not use hard water.  Pickles must be placed in a brine and
  fermented for approximately 6 weeks before the addition of the final and
  last brine."
  
  1.  Wash cucumbers carefully. Use only freshly harvested, slightly immature
  pickling variety. 2. Weigh cucumbers. Put in a clean pickling container and
  cover with a water. (Cucumbers may be added during the first day or two of
  curing process if enough brine is added to cover them and if salt is added
  in definite amounts to maintain a 10% brine. 3. Weight cucumbers under
  brine 4. Store in a cool dark place. 5. Next day, add 1 cup salt for each 5
  pounds of cucumbers.  This is necessary to maintain a 10% brine solution.
  Salt must be added on top of plate or clean cloth (and not directly on the
  cucumbers) for even distribution throughout the brine. 6. Remove scum when
  it forms on top of brine.  The scum will destroy the acidity of the brine
  and result in spoilage of the product, if left on. 7. At the end of the
  week, and for 4 or 5 succeeding weeks, add 1/4 cup salt for each 5 pounds
  of cucumbers.  Add in the same manner as No.5. 8. Fermentation resulting in
  bubble formation should continue about 4 weeks. Test for bubbles by tapping
  container on the side with your hand. As a second test, cut a cucumber in
  half; if it is the same color throughout and has no noticeable rings or
  white spots, fermentation is complete. 9. Cucumbers may be kept in this 10%
  brine solution--no additional salt is added after they are cured--until
  made into pickles.  The best temperature for brining cucumbers is about 70
  to 75.

  (BTW: salt and vinegar may be varied to suit individual taste.)
  
  A further addition from the master pickle maker.....
  
  To make pickled green tomatoes....use the same recipe as above, but add a 2
  ~3 inch piece of fresh celery stalk to the jar.  Let stand for 5 weeks at
  room temperature, then refrigerate and enjoy...
  
  Remember, do not use a bare metal top...the vinegar and salt will rust it
  and give the pickles a bad taste...

      Title: Homemade Crab Apple Pectin
 Categories: Toppings, Preserve
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 lb Sliced unpeeled crab apples         3 c  Water
 
  Simmer, stirring for 30 to 40 minutes, adding water as needed.  Plop into
  colander lined with one layer of cheesecloth and set over a bowl; press to
  force the juices.  To clear, heat the collected juice and pour through a
  stout jelly bag that has been moistened in hot water.  The result is the
  pectin you will use right away, can (1/2" headroom, process 185 F for 15
  min), or freeze.  Refrigerate after opening.
  
  Liquid pectin is especially helpful in making peach, pear, strawberry or
  other jellies whose fruit is low in pectin.
  
  4-6 tb of homemade pectin for every 1 cup of prepared juice should give a
  good gel.  For tart apple pectin, start with 4 pounds sliced apples with
  peels & cores and 8 cups of water.  Simmer 3 min, press through sieve.
  Return liquid to heavy kettle and cook briskly, stirring, until volume is
  reduced by one-half.  Clarify and use as above.

  Bring to a boil and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in
  tomato paste and continue cooking 7-8 minutes longer or until mixture is of
  a thick consistency with very little free liquid, stirring frequently.
  Meanwhile, wash 3 pint jars in hot soapy water; rinse. Keep hot until
  needed. Prepare lids as manufacturer directs. Ladle chutney into 1 hot jar
  at a time, leaving 1/4" headspace. Release trapped air. Wipe rim of jar
  with a clean damp cloth. Attach lid and place in canner. Fill and close
  remaining jars. Process 10 minutes in a boiling-water bath.
  
  Makes about 3 pint jars.
  
  NOTE: This chutney improves if stored at least 3 weeks before serving.
  Garnish with an Italian parsley sprig, if desired, and serve as an
  accompaniment to curries or with crusty bread and cheese.

 Categories: Preserve
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           See Below                      
 
  Select fully ripened fruits and rinse them quickly under cold water and
  then drain thoroughly.  Do not soak the fruit in water.  Do not double the
  recipes.  Do not substitute ingredients.  Do not reduce the amount of sugar
  or increase the amount of fruit used.  An exact balance of fruit, sugar,
  and pectin is needed for jelling to occur.  For no cook jams, mash the
  fruit with a potato masher.  For cooked jams, process the fruit in a food
  processor using quick on and off pulses until finely chopped. For
  preserves, until coarsely chopped.  Do NOT puree.
  
  NOTE:
  
  A rolling boil is a boil that cannot be stirred down.

      Title: Jellies
 Categories: Condiment, Toppings, Preserve
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Text Only                      
 
  Select and wash fruits.  Remove stems, hulls, and blossom ends. Cut hard
  fruit in quarters.  Do not pare or remove seeds.
  
  Extraction of Juice Soft Fruit: Use just enough water to prevent fruit from
  sticking.  Heat gradually, stirring constantly.  Crush fruit and cook until
  it has lost its color. Hard Fruit: Cook, with sufficient water to cover,
  until fruit is soft. Do not crush if a clear jelly is desired.
  
  Straining the Juice:  Pour cooked fruit into a wet flannel jelly bag. Allow
  juice to drip into a large container.  Do not squeeze fruit if a clear
  jelly is desired.  When juice has stopped dripping return pulp to
  preserving kettle.  Add sufficient water to cover. Cook slowly, stirring
  constantly, for thirty minutes. Again strain juice, but keep this second
  extraction separate from the first as the first extraction makes the
  clearest jelly.  A third extraction may be made from some fruits, depending
  upon the pectin content.
  
  Test for Pectin:  Combine 1 tablespoon cooked fruit juice, 1 teaspoon
  sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon Epsom salts.  Stir until salts dissolve. Allow to
  stand about 20 minutes.  If juice contains sufficient pectin to make jelly,
  the mixture will form into a gelatinous mass or large flaky particles. If
  fruit juice shows only a small amount of pectin, use an equal volume of
  apple juice, which is rich in pectin, and a satisfactory jelly will be
  obtained.
  
  Sugar Content of Jelly:  Too large a proportion of sugar will result in a
  gummy jelly which can not be molded.  Too small a proportion of sugar will
  result in a tough, dark jelly with an inferior flavor. Currants, unripe
  grapes, and green gooseberries are about the only fruits which require an
  equal measure of sugar. Two-thirds as much sugar as fruit juice is the
  usual rule.
  
  Cooking the Jelly:  Work with a small quantity of juice, not more than two
  quarts at a time. Measure juice, heat rapidly to boiling. Add sugar, stir
  until it is dissolved. Boil rapidly until a jelly test is obtained. The
  sugar may be heated before adding to boiling juice if desired.
  
  The Jelly Test: Dip a spoon into the boiling liquid.  Pour juice from
  spoon.  If it sheets and two drops hang together from the side of the
  spoon, the jelly is done and must be removed from the fire immediately.
  Skim.
  
  Sealing and Storing:  Pour the jelly immediately into freshly sterilized
  glasses.  Cover at once with a thin layer of melted paraffin. Roll the
  glasses to insure the entire surface being well covered. Cool. Cover with a
  second layer of melted paraffin. Label. Store in a cool place.

      Title: Jim's Orange Marmalade
 Categories: Toppings, Preserve
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Seville oranges (about 5)           6 c  Water
      1    Lemon                           7 1/2 c  Sugar
 
  Directions: Put 4 small saucers in freezer. In a very large pot, combine
  oranges, lemon and water. Cover and bring to a simmer. Let simmer 2 hours.
  DON'T ALLOW TO BOIL. Turn off heat. Remove fruit. Let cool 5 minutes. Cut
  in half and scoop pulp, seeds and pith back into pan. Put shells to one
  side.  Bring pan to a boil and boil hard 5 minutes. Strain through damp
  cheese cloth in a sieve. Gather ends and squeeze out remaining juice. You
  should have 6 cups. Make up any difference with water. Return liquid to
  pan.  Remove all white pith from skins. Cut skins in fine strips (or as
  desired) and add to pan with sugar. Place over low heat and stir to
  dissolve sugar.  Bring to boil. Boil hard, stirring occasionally to prevent
  scorching.  Boil hard until jell point is reached, between 60 and 90
  minutes depending on natural fruit pectin available. Jell point test. Chill
  some saucers in freezer while preparing marmalade, 2 or 3. Test: drop a
  small amount of hot marmalade on chilled plate and chill for 2 minutes. Run
  finger through marmalade on plate.  If surface wrinkles, it has reached
  jelling point.  If still syrupy, continue boiling.  Repeat test at 5 minute
  intervals until jell point is reached.  Remove pan from stove and stir for
  5 minutes, skimming off any foam. Ladle into sterilized jars, leaving 1/2
  inch head space.  Seal as you like

      8 oz Pearl onions, peeled            2 1/2 c  Malt vinegar

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
  2 1/2 c  Malt vinegar                        1 tb Turmeric
      3 tb Mustard seed, bruised               1 tb Dry mustard
      1 sl Ginger, 2", peeled & chopped      1/2 c  Sugar
      4    Garlic cloves, halved               3 tb Flour
      1 tb Black Peppercorns, bruised          4 tb Water
 
  A traditional English mustard pickle, Piccalilli is made from a variety of
  vegetables which are first soaked in brine, then pickled in vinegar.  The
  finished pickle is yellow in colour owing to the presence of turmeric and
  mustard.  The pickle may be served immediately it has cooled, but it
  improves with keeping and may be stored for up to 3 months.  Piccalilli is
  usually served with cold meats.  Use firm red tomatoes if green ones are
  unavailable.  About 3 pounds.
  
  Place the cauliflower, cucumber, pearl onions, Spanish onion and tomatoes
  in a large bowl.  Sprinkle with salt over the vegetables and set them aside
  for 4 hours.
  
  Drain the vegetables in a colander and discard the liquid.
  
  In a large saucepan, bring the vinegar to a boil over high heat.  Add the
  vegetables and reduce the heat to low.  Cover the pan and simmer the
  vegetables for 15 minutes or until they are almost tender when pierced with
  the point of a sharp knife.
  
  Remove the pan from the heat and drain the vegetables in a colander.
  Discard the vinegar.  Place the vegetables in a large bowl. Sauce: To make
  the sauce, pour the vinegar into a medium sized pan and stir in the mustard
  seeds, ginger, garlic, peppercorns, turmeric, mustard and sugar. Place the
  pan over low heat and stir to dissolve the sugar. When the sugar has
  dissolved, increase the heat to moderate and bring to a boil, stirring
  frequently.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer the mixture for 15 minutes.
  Remove the pan from the heat and strain the liquid into a medium sized
  bowl.  Discard the flavourings left in the strainer.
  
  Rinse the pan and return the strained mixture to it.  Stir in the flour
  mixed with the water and place over moderate heat.  Bring the sauce to a
  boil, stirring constantly, and boil for 2 minutes.
  
  Remove the pan from the heat and pour sauce over the vegetables.  Mix the
  vegetables with the sauce with 2 spoons, tossing until coated with sauce.
  
  Spoon into clean, warm, dry jars with screw top lids.  Spoon any sauce
  remaining into the jars, so they are completely full.  Place lids on the
  jars and half screw into position.  Set jars aside until completely cold.
  Screw lids on firmly and store the jars in a cool, dry place.

      Title: Lavender Jelly
 Categories: Condiment
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      7 fl Dry champagne                       2 tb Lemon juice
           -OR- dry white wine                 1 oz Lavender flowers
      7 fl Unsweetened apple juice             4 ts Gelatine
      2 fl Creme de cassis                     4 tb -Water
    1/4 c  Sugar                          
 
  This exotic and gorgeously pretty jelly comes from John McGeever of Congham
  Hall in Norfolk and can be eaten both as a superb dessert with, perhaps, a
  little cream, or as an unusual accompaniment to roast game or rabbit.
  
  Gently heat the champagne or white wine with the apple juice, creme de
  cassis, sugar and lemon juice.  Pour onto the lavender flowers and leave,
  covered, to infuse for about 10 minutes.  Sprinkle the gelatine onto the
  water and leave to soften, then heat gently until the gelatine is
  completely dissolved.
  
  Strain the lavender liquid, pressing it to extract all the juices.  Warm
  the lavender liquid and add the dissolved gelatine. Stir and strain again
  through a fine sieve or muslin.  Leave to cool and set.  The jelly will
  keep for about 14 days in a fridge.

      Title: Lemon Marmalade
 Categories: Condiment, Preserve
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 lb Lemons - Meyer or regular           8 c  Sugar - granulated (actually
           -lemons                                  -8 to 10 cups)
 
  Slice the lemons as thin as possible.  Discard ends.  Remove all seeds and
  tie them in a square of doubled cheesecloth.  Put lemons and seed bag in a
  nonreactive bowl with enough water to cover.  Let stand overnight.
  
  Measure the lemons and water into a wide, shallow, nonreactive pan. Add an
  equal volume of sugar and cook over low heat until sugar is dissolved.
  Raise heat to medium-high and cook, stirring frequently and skimming off
  the foam as it rises, until temperature reaches 220F, about 1/2 hour.
  Remove marmalade from heat.
  
  To test for consistency, drop a little marmalade on a saucer and put the
  saucer into the freezer until marmalade is cold, about 5 minutes. Tip the
  saucer:  the marmalade should just barely run.  If too thin, return the
  marmalade to medium-high heat and cook, testing often, until it has reached
  the right consistency.
  
  Put marmalade into hot, sterilized pint or half-pint jars.  Store in
  refrigerator up to 1 month or, for longer storage, seal according to
  reliable canning instructions.

  occasionally to scrape down sides of bowl. Strain mixture through sieve,
  pressing down on solids with spoon.  Reserve 1/4 cup ginger juice.
  
  Remove cheesecloth bag from saucepan and squeeze it between spoons so
  liquid drains back into pan.  Add 4 cups sugar to lemon mixture and stir
  until dissolved.  Add reserved 1/4 cup ginger juice.  Simmer mixture
  uncovered until it reaches gelling stage, about 1 hour.  (To test for
  doneness, remove pan from heat. Fill chilled spoon with preserves, then
  slowly pour preserves back into pan; last 2 drops should merge and sheet
  off spoon.  One tablespoon of preserves spooned onto chilled plate and
  frozen 2 minutes should wrinkle when gently pushed with fingertip.)
  
  Rinse clean jars, lids and screw bands in hot water.  Spoon preserves into
  hot jar to 1/4 inch from top.  Immediately wipe rim, using towel dipped
  into hot water.  Place lid on jar, seal tightly with screw band. Repeat
  with remaining preserves and jars.  Arrange jars on rack set into large
  pot.  Cover with boiling water by at least 1 inch.  Cover pot and boil 15
  minutes.*
  
  Remove jars from water bath. Cool to room temperature.  Press center of
  each lid.  If lid stays down, jar is sealed.  Store in cool dry place up to
  1 year. Refrigerate after opening.  (If lid pops up, store preserves in
  refrigerator.)
  
  * If preserves have not been processed in water bath as described above,
  cover and refrigerate.
  
  Makes about 3-1/2 cups.

      Title: Lime-Pine Marmalade
 Categories: Condiment, Preserve
      Yield: 7 servings
 
      1    Grapefruit                               Approximately 5 cups sugar
      2    Limes                                    -(2 1/2 pounds)
      1 lg Pineapple                           2 tb Freshly grated orange rind
           Approximately 5 cups water     
 
  Makes about 7 half-pints. Wash and remove the seeds of the limes and the
  grapefruit and dice or put them through a meat grinder. Pare, core and chop
  the pineapple. Measure all the fruit including the juice, and add 1 1/2
  cups of water for each cup of fruit; let this stand overnight. The next
  morning, simmer the fruit and water, uncovered, over low heat until the
  fruit is tender, about 1 hour. Measure the mixture again and add the orange
  rind and 1 cup of sugar for each cup of pulp. Cook over medium heat until
  sugar has dissolved, stirring constantly. Then cook over high heat until
  your jelly thermometer reads 220 - 222 F, or the syrup sheets (2 drops
  falling from the side of a spoon and forming 1 large drop). Ladle into hot,
  sterilized jars and seal immediately.
  
  To seal:  Fill to within 1/2-inch head room, being sure to first wipe the
  rim and threads of the jars with a hot damp cloth to remove all particles
  of food, seeds or spices.  While contents are hot, cover with a 1/8-inch
  layer of paraffin.  When paraffin has set, add another layer of melted
  paraffin, tilting and rotating the jar to seal completely.

      Title: Low-Sugar Refrigerator Strawberry Jam
 Categories: Toppings, Preserve
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 c  Sliced strawberries                 1    Envelope unflavored gelatin
    1/3 c  Sugar                             1/2 c  Water
      2 tb Lemon juice                    
 
  1.   In a medium saucepan, combine strawberries, sugar and lemon juice.
  Heat 5 minutes, crushing the berries slightly. Bring to a boil; boll
  rapidly, stirring constantly, 3 minutes.
  
  2.   In a small bowl, sprinkle unflavored gelatin over cold water.  Let
  stand 1 minute.  Add to strawberry mixture and heat, stirring until gelatin
  is completely dissolved, about 3 minutes.
  
  3.   Let jam stand 5 minutes, skiing off foam with a spoon. Ladle into
  jars.  Cover and cool slightly before storing in the refrigerator for
  several weeks or in the freezer for longer storage.
  
  If cooked jam does not set 24 hours after processing there are steps that
  can be taken to solve the problem.  The Department of Agriculture Home and
  Garden Bulletin No.  56 states:
  
  Soft jams made with regular pectin can sometimes be improved by recooking
  according to the following directions.  It is best to recook only 4 to 6
  cup of jelly or jam at one time.
  
  To remake with powdered pectin: Measure the jam to be recooked.  For each
  quart of jelly or jam, measure 1/@ cup sugar, 1/4 cup water and 4 tsp
  powdered pectin.  Mix the pectin and water and bring to boiling, stirring
  constantly to prevent.scorching.  Add the jam and sugar. Stir thoroughly.
  Bring to a full rolling boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Boil
  mixture hard for 1/2 minute. Remove jam from the heat; skim off foam. Ladle
  into hot sterilized jars.  Adjust lids and screw bands and process in a
  boiling water bath for 5 minutes. Start counting time when water comes to a
  boil.
  
  To remake with liquid pectin: Measure the jam to be recooked.  For each
  quart of jam, measure 3/4 cup sugar, 2 Tbsp lemon juice and 2 Tbsp liquid
  pectin.  Bring jam to boiling over high heat.  Quickly add the sugar, lemon
  juice and pectin and bring to a full rolling boil; stir constantly. Boil
  mixture hard for 1 minute.  Remove jam from the heat; skim off foam. Ladle
  into hot sterilized jars.  Adjust lids and screw bands and process in a
  boiling water bath for 5 minutes.  Start counting time when water comes to
  a boil.  If there are problems with the Sure-Jell One Step (Fruit

      Title: Malosol'nye Ogurtsy - Brined Cucumbers Malossol
 Categories: Pickles
      Yield: 6 servings
 
     24    Cucumber, medium pickling           9    Clove garlic
           -3-4" long, 1 1/4" thick          1/4 lb Parsley, sour cherry and/or
      1 oz Horseradish root                         -black currant leaves
      1    Dill, bunch mature plants       3 1/2 tb Salt, non-iodized per 2 qts
           -with seeds                              -water
 
  Prepare the cucumbers following the instructions for Brined Cucumbers.
  
  Rinse the dill and divide in half. Scrub and rinse the horseradish and
  slice thinly.  Peel and halve the garlic.  Wash the various leaves.
  
  Fold half of the dill into a ring and place in the bottom of the jar. Strew
  half the horseradish and garlic and 1/3 of leaves on top. Arrange half of
  pickles upright, packing them tightly.  Place 1/3 of the leaves on top,
  then pack in the rest of the cucumbers in the same manner. Top with layers
  of the remaining horseradish, dill, garlic, and leaves.
  
  Combine the salt and water, stirring until the salt dissolves (the
  percenteage of salt in this brine is 2.8-3.0 percent).  Pour the brine into
  the jar.  The contents should be fully covered.  Place the saucer inside
  the jar with a weight (small rock?). Cover the mouth of the jar with 2
  layers of cheesecloth and secure with string.
  
  Leave for 3-4 days in cool, airy room whose temperature is about 64-68
  degrees.
  
  Remove the scum as it appears and wash the mouth of the jar daily. After
  3-4 days, when most active fermentation has subsided a little, remove
  weight and lid.  cover jar with its own lid and refrigerate. In 1 2 days
  the malossol cucumbers will be ready to eat.  Because there is less salt in
  the brine than Brined Cucumbers, malossol cucumbers should be eaten sooner.
  
  Store the pickles on the lowest shelf of the refrigerator for 4-5 days,
  after which they will become either too salty (and turn into regular brined
  cucumbers) or, more likely, too soft and almost mushy.

  The jelly will only be as good as the juice you use is.  Jelly must be
  boiling hot to achieve a seal when using vacuum lids and metal screw bands.
  Pour jelly into jar, holding ladle or kettle close to the top of the jar.
  This prevents air bubbles from forming.  Quickly fill jar to within 1/8
  inch (3mm) of the top.  Wipe top and threads with a clean, damp cloth.  Put
  hot lid on with sealing compound next to jar.  Screw band on evenly and
  tightly.  Invert jar for a few seconds so hot jelly can destroy any mold or
  yeast which may have settled on the lid.  Cool, test for seal, remove bands
  and store.
  
  Or:
  
  Jelly glasses are filled in a manner similar to jars, except a 1/2 inch
  head space (13mm) is left at the top.  Then the jelly is immediately
  covered with a 1/8 inch (3mm) layer of melted, but not smoking paraffin.  A
  single, thin layer of paraffin holds a seal better than a thick layer.  To
  insure a good seal, paraffin must touch all sides of the glass.  Prick any
  air bubbles that appear on the paraffin.  Bubbles cause holes to appear as
  the paraffin hardens, and an imperfect seal may result.  Allow glasses to
  stand until paraffin hardens and then cover with metal lids.  Store in a
  cool, dark, dry place.  Make only one batch at a time.

    1/2 c  Vinegar                         3 1/2 c  Sugar
           Green coloring                    1/2 c  Mint leaves
      1 c  Water                             1/2 c  Commercial pectin (boxed)
 
  Combine vinegar, water, mint leaves, and enough coloring to give tint
  desired. Add sugar, stir, and bring to a boil.  Add pectin at once,
  stirring constantly, and bring again to a full boil for 1/2 minute.  Strain
  off mint leaves and pour into glasses.
  
  **When cold, cover with paraffin.  Approximate yield: 6 (6 oz.) glasses. My
  note:  The newer directions call for the jelly to be sealed while scalding
  hot.  I've also put lids on and put it in the freezer.  If you have trouble
  with thickening use more pectin.

      Title: Minted Apple Butter
 Categories: Preserve
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      4    Apples, cored, peeled               1 tb Dry mint (3 tb chopped fresh
    1/2 c  Water                               1 ts Ascorbic acid color keeper
 
  Serve with ham, lamb, gingerbread, muffins, pancakes.
  
  My note: Original directions called for apples to be chopped and cooked
  with cores and peels. After discarding what looked like a lot of applesauce
  stuck to the peel and picking bits of seeds out of my teeth, I would
  suggest cooking the peels and cores separately to get some apple juice.
  
  Cook apples with water, mint and color keeper (sold with canning supplies)
  in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil, simmer about 15 min. until apples are
  tender.  Mash.  Continue to simmer about 10 min until thick.  Press through
  a sieve or use a blender if you have already separated the peel and cores.
  
  Ladle into hot clean jars leaving 1 cm headspace.  Wipe jar rims.  Process
  10 min in boiling water bath.  Store in a cool, dark, dry place.

  one-half. Measure into 4-cup units. <Cooking in this quantity will produce
  better flavor.> If oranges are overly sweet, add 1 tbsp lemon juice for
  every cup of fruit. Bring to boiling point. Boil 8 minutes. Add 3/4 cup
  sugar for each cup of fruit.
  
  Boil first unit rapidly until it jells -- not more than 10 min. If a longer

      5    Red plums                         1/2 c  Water
      1 ts Whole cloves                        9 ts Artificial sugar = to sugar*
 
  * Recipe suggests 9 aspartame tablets crushed.  Liquid sweetener would

  Peel and core pears; chop coarsely.  Place in a large saucepan and sprinkle
  with ascorbic acid color keeper.  Remove pits from plums and cut each plum
  into 8 pieces.  Stir plums into pears.
  
  Wrap plum pits, cloves and ginger, if desired, in a piece of cheesecloth
  and place under some of the fruit.  Add cinnamon stick and water.
  
  Cover, bring to a boil and simmer 15 to 20 min or until fruit is tender.
  Discard spice bag and cinnamon stick.  Puree fruit mixture in a blender or
  food processor or press through a sieve.
  
  Return to saucepan.  Simmer, uncovered 15 to 20 min or until mixture coats
  a metal spoon.
  
  Remove from heat.  Stir in sweetener.  Ladle into hot clean jars leaving
  1/2 inch headspace.  Wipe jar rims, seal.  Process 10 min in a boiling
  water bath.  Store in a cool, dark, dry place.

      Title: Pepper Jelly
 Categories: Toppings, Spices/etc., Hot, Preserve
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  3 1/2 c  Sugar                             1/2 c  Hot pepper slices
      1 c  Cider vinegar                       1    Packet (1/2 bottle) Certo
    3/4 c  Sweet pepper slices                      -liquid pectin
 
  Simmer sugar, vinegar and peppers very slowly for 10 minutes stirring to be
  sure all sugar is well dissolved. Turn off heat and let stand for 30
  minutes.  Bring to a boil and add Certo. Boil 1 minute. Cool and stir with
  non-metal spoon 5 minutes. Check that it comes of the spoon in a ribbon or
  sheet. If not, cook it a bit more. Pour into jars and seal, or pour into
  freezer containers and freeze (that's what I do).
  
  Note: the peppers are seeded and sliced 1/4 inch thick with a knife or on a
  mandoline, for a marmalade effect. I like to use red and yellow peppers for
  color, or all green. Mixing red and green isn't as pretty as you might
  think it would be, as it makes the jelly browner. I have substituted home
  made pectin, which seems to work fine, if it is the same consistency as the
  Certo. It just tends to be pinker. I make that by boiling apple skins and
  cores in as little water as possible, with a lid on, and then cooling it
  and pressing the juice out through a sieve and saving it in a bottle in the
  fridge till I have enough. How much is enough? About a cup of the home made
  pectin, as I recall. If the stuff doesn't jell right I save it in the
  fridge, then later add more pectin and more sugar and cook it until it
  sheets right.  --Helen Fleischer

      4 c  Cucumber wedges quartered 1"        1 c  Cider vinegar
      2    Cloves garlic, optional             1 c  Water
      2 tb Pickling salt                       1 tb Dill seed
      2 c  Ice cubes                         1/2 ts Crushed red pepper
 
  Cut large cucumber lengthwise in quarters, then in 1" long pieces.
  
  Combine cucumber, garlic, if desired, and salt in a glass bowl.  Cover with
  ice cubes.  Let stand in a cool place at least 6 hours or overnight. Drain
  well.
  
  Combine vinegar, water, dill seed and crushed red pepper in a saucepan.
  Bring to a boil.  Add drained cucumbers, return to boil.  Cover and cook 2
  min.  Remove garlic cloves.  Spoon into hot sterilized jars.  Wipe jar
  rims.  Seal.
  
  MY NOTE:  this recipe did not call for processing in a hot water bath so I
  made 1/2 batch and kept them in the fridge.  Similar recipe in Bernardin
  Guide to Home Preserving calls for processing 10 minutes at altitudes up to
  1000 ft.

      Title: Pickled Cabbage
 Categories: Pickles
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lg Cabbage                           1/2 c  Salt
 
  "Cabbage is a frequent constituent of pickles, but this is the first time
  we have had it pickled alone.  This make a very sharp pickle - almost a
  condiment that might be used in place of horseradish. It is very good in an
  oyster cocktail sauce and may be used sparingly as a relish for meats."
  
  White wine vinegar Cloves, mace and allspice
  
  Slice or shred the cabbage very fine.  Put it into an earthen dish and
  sprinkle with the salt, mixing it in well.  Cover with another dish and let
  it stand for twenty-four hours.
  
  Drain the cabbage and take enough vinegar to cover it.  Add, for each pint,
  four whole cloves, two blades of mace and four whole allspice. Boil the
  vinegar for two minutes and pour over the cabbage.  Seal in pint jars. This
  amount makes about three pints.
  
  The directions for sealing are to "cover it close with a cloth.  Then tie
  it over with leather," but we find that the glass jar method is more
  satisfactory.             -Bossis

      4 lg Onions, thinly sliced               1 tb Pickling spice
      1 c  White vinegar                       4    Bay leaves
    1/2 c  Water                          
 
  Wash the herring fillets well under running cold water.
  
  In a glass or crockery bowl, place the fillets.  Cover the fillets with
  cold water and refrigerate overnight (about 10 to 12 hours).
  
  Rinse the fillets again and place them in a glass or enameled casserole or
  baking pan.  Cover the herring with the sliced onions, making layers in
  necessary.
  
  Now make the marinade.  In a saucepan, combine the vinegar, water, sugar,
  pickling spice, and bay leaves.  Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer.
  Cook for 3 to 5 minutes until the sugar is dissolved.  Cool slightly and
  pour over the herring fillets.  Cover and place in a cool spot or
  refrigerate and marinate for 2 to 3 days before serving.
  
  Remove the herring fillets from the marinade and slice into bite-size
  pieces.  Place the pieces in a serving bowl.  Remove the bay leaves from
  the marinade. Mix the marinade and onions with the herring pieces, and
  serve.  Makes 10 to 12 servings.
  
  ADVICE FROM MAMA:  While ny father used an old-fashioned enameled pan in
  which to soak and marinate the herring, I prefer to use those nice plastic
  containers that come in different shapes and sizes, each with its own lid.
  They're manufactured by Rubbermaid and sold in grocery stores and hardward
  stores.  Sometimes progress is great.

 Categories: Vegetables, Pickles, Hot
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Small, fresh hot red peppers        1 lg Bay leaf; torn into quarters
      4    Garlic cloves; peeled               2 c  Distilled white vinegar
           -=OR=- More if you like             2 c  Water
      8    Whole allspice                      2 ts Salt
     24    Peppercorns                         4 tb Olive oil, or as needed
 
  RINSE AND DRAIN THE PEPPERS; trim stems to a stub. Pack the peppers into 4
  wide-mouthed pint canning jars, dividing them equally. As the peppers are
  packed, scatter among them a share of the seasonings:
  
  In each jar place: 1 clove garlic split; 2 whole allspice; 6 peppercorns;
  and a piece of bay leaf.
  
  Combine the vinegar, water and salt in a stainless-steel or enameled
  saucepan and heat the mixture to simmering. Pour the hot solution over the
  peppers, covering them completely and leaving 1 inch of head space. Remove
  any bubbles and add liquid if necessary to maintain head space. (If there
  should be insufficient solution to cover the peppers, make more in the same
  proportions; no harm will be done if a few moments are required to do
  this.) Add enough olive oil to each jar to cover the surface of the liquid,
  about 1 tablespoon. Seal the jars with new two-piece canning lids,
  according to manufacturer's directions and process for 15 minutes in a
  boiling water bath. Cool, label and store the jars. The peppers are good to
  eat after 2 weeks, but they will be better after at least a month's rest in
  the jar.

  garlic (optional), and a sprig of Mexican oregano (also optional, but
  highly recommended).
  
  Pack the washed peppers into the jars.  For a hotter product, prick each
  pepper a couple of times with a fork (I don't know why, but it seems to
  work).
  
  Fill the jars with boiling vinegar to cover the peppers well.  Cap. My
  grandmother never processed these, just stuck them on the shelf for a
  couple of months to marinate.  On the rare occasions when I've made 'em, I
  keep the jars under refrigeration, just to be sure.
  
  Please note I am NOT a canning/preserving expert -- have done VERY little
  of this (got my fill of it as a kid).  I've only made these a couple of
  times as an adult, and they turned out fine, but surely there are more
  expert opinions out there....

           *Ingredients*                       1    Beef Tongue NOTE!!
 
  PICKLED TONGUE
  
  This is a favorite dish of my family's, especially on holidays like Easter
  and Christmas. Most people cringe at the idea of eating a cow's tongue, but
  actually the meat is very tender, and even if you have to close your eyes
  and plug your nose to try it, please do. I guarantee it won't be what you
  expect!
  
  3C. Red Wine Vinegar                      Make sure to use glass 1 2 Bulbs
  Garlic                          bowls and pans when cooking 1 1/2C. Virgin
  Olive Oil                  the tongue, as metal will 1/4C. Parsley (dried
  or fresh)            change the flavor of the 3/4T. Sweet Basil meat,
  leaving it tasting 1/2T. Rosemary metallic. Salt and Pepper to taste
  
  *Directions*
  
  1. Place tongue in glass saucepan with enough water to cover it.
  
  2. Bring water to boil slowly over a medium heat and continue boiling for
  approx. 45 min.- hour.
  
  3. While the tongue is boiling, prepare the marinade in a glass bowl.
  
  4. In bowl, combine the olive oil and red wine vinegar. Use a garlic press
  to crush the cloves, or you can crush them with the flat side of a knife.
  
  rest of the herbs and spices.
  
  6. When the tongue has cooled enough to handle, peel by slicing thinly with
  a sharp paring knife, removing all the taste buds and the fat at the base
  of the tongue. Then proceed in slicing the tongue widthwise.
  
  lid, and layer with the marinade.
  
  8. Put the mixture in the fridge with the lid on and allow it to remain
  there, unopened for at least 4 days.
  
  9. When you are ready to serve the tongue, remove it from the fridge an
  hour before, as this dish is best at room temp.

      Title: Pocket Spreads
 Categories: Spreads
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           -VIVIAN THIELE NRHF19C         
 
  The following recipes are additional spreads that can be used in place of
  butter on the outside of bread/dough when making pockets.
  
  Mayo Spread: 1/4 cup real Mayonnaise; 1/4 tsp. onion powder; 1/4 tsp.
  celery salt.  Stir to combine.  Enough for 8 slices of bread. Mayo spread
  will enhance the flavor of most foods except sweets. Especially good on
  sandwiches with eggs, cheese, ham and seafood or vegetable pockets.
  
  Curried Mayonnaise: 1/4 cup mayonnaise; 1 tsp. mild Indian curry powder.
  Stir to combine - enough for 8 slices of bread.  Curry is a nice flavor
  accompaniment with beef, chicken, lamb, shrimp and vegetables.
  
  Maple butter: 1/4 soft butter or margarine; 1/2 tsp. maple flavoring. Stir
  to combine. Enough for 8 slices. Use maple butter for pockets. Use with
  pork, ham or sweets.
  
  Vanilla butter: 1/4 soft butter or margarine; 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Stir
  to combine - enough for 8 slices of bread.  Vanilla butter enhances flavor
  and has an enticing aroma while cooking.
  
  Almond Butter: 1/4 soft butter or margarine; 1/4 tsp almond extract. Stir
  to combine - enough for 8 slices bread.  Use with fruit pie filling or
  other sweets.
  
  Herbed butter: 1/4 cup soft butter or margarine; 1/4 tsp herbs (combine
  basil, thyme, rosemary and tarragon).  Stir to combine. Spread on one side
  of 8 bread slices or other bread products used for pockets. This taste
  especially good with meats, cheese and vegetables.
  
  Garlic butter: 1/4 cup soft butter or margarine; 1 clove garlic, crushed.
  Stir to combine.  Enough for 8 bread slices.  Use with any eat or vegetable
  filling.
  
  Honey butter: 1/4 cup soft butter or margarine; 1 tblsp. honey. Stir to
  combine.  This is enough to spread 8 slices of bread. Because the honey
  promotes browning, use this on pockets which only have to brown and heat
  through.  If used on egg sandwiches,etc... the bread may over brown before
  the egg finishes cooking.
  
  Lemon butter: 1/4 cup soft butter or margarine; finely grated rind of 1
  lemon (about 1/2tsp.).  Stir to combine.  This is enough to spread 8 slices
  of bread.  The fresh lemon brings out the flavor of fruit filling and
  seafood fillings.

 Categories: Spices/etc.
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 c  Flour                               2 ts Chili powder
      2 ts Cayenne pepper                      2 tb Taco seasoning
      1 c  Bran flake cereal, crushed          1 ts Season pepper
      2 tb Parsley flakes                      1 ts Curry (or more)
      2 ts Garlic powder                       1 ts Sweet basil
      1 tb Onion powder                        1 ts Oregano
 
  Mix all together and use for coating any and all types of meat.  I use a
  large size ZipLoc and just keep it in the freezer. You can add more of the
  cayenne and chili powder if you so desire. I usually just throw in what I
  have at the time I make it so it is never the same twice. It is a great all
  round coating.

           See below                      
 
  Use 8oz glass jars with two part tops, (lids with screw bands), to store
  the cooked jams and preserves.  Select one or two cup glass or rigid
  plastic containers with tight-fitting lids for no cook freezer jams and
  preserves. Wash the jars and glasses with screw bands in an automatic
  dishwasher with very hot rinse water, keep hot until ready to use or wash
  with hot, soapy water and rinse very thoroughly. Place the jars and glasses
  upside down in a large saucepan filled with water and bring to boiling and
  boil for 10 minutes. Keep them hot. Was two-part lids in the automatic
  dishwasher with very hot rinse water again, keeping them hot until ready to
  use or wash in hot soapy water and rinse well. Place in a small saucepan
  filled with water and bring to a boil. Remove them from the water but keep
  them hot until ready to use. Fill the jars to within 1/4-inch for the
  cooked jams and 1/2-inch for the no cook freezer jams. Using a plastic
  knife or spatula, make sure there are no air bubbles in the jam. Wipe the
  jar rims and screw threads with a clean damp cloth. Cover with the lids,
  screwing them down tight, and invert the jars for 5 minutes. then turn
  upright. Let the jars stand at room temperature for 1 hour for cooked jams
  or 24 hours for no cook jams. Gently stir no cook jams before refrigerating
  or freezing. ALL JAMS MUST BE FROZEN OR REFRIGERATED! Store jams in the
  freezer for up to 1 year.  Thaw frozen jams in the refrigerator.  Thawed
  jams have a refrigerator shelf life of 3 weeks.
  
  NOTE:
  
  With the exception of two of the following recipes (the ones without
  pectin) they may be processed as canned goods by using the instructions
  found in any good cookbook for preserving jellies and jams.

  Makes about 6 half-pints. Wash and remove the seeds of the limes and lemons
  and put fruits through a food chopper or cut in small pieces. Measure the
  pulp and add 3 cups of water for each cup of pulp; let stand overnight. The
  next morning, boil the mixture, uncovered, in a preserving kettle about 20
  minutes.  Remove mixture to a bowl, cover and let stand again overnight The
  next morning, measure citrus mixture. Cooking batches of only 4 to 6 cups
  of fruit at a time, measure out 3/4 cup of sugar for each cup of fruit and
  combine fruit and sugar in a preserving kettle.  Bring mixture slowly to a
  boil, stirring frequently until sugar has dissolved. Then boil rapidly for
  about 20 minutes until jellying point is reached. Test for jellying point
  with a jelly thermometer which should read 200 to 222 F, or with a spoon
  which, when dipped into mixture, has 2 drops form along the edge, come
  together and fall as 1 drop. Ladle into hot, sterilized jars and seal
  immediately.
  
  To seal:  Fill to within 1/2-inch head room, being sure to first wipe the
  rim and threads of the jars with a hot damp cloth to remove all particles
  of food, seeds or spices.  While contents are hot, cover with a 1/8-inch
  layer of paraffin.  When paraffin has set, add another layer of melted
  paraffin, tilting and rotating the jar to sea/l completely. Jams and

    1/3 c  Strong black coffee                      Pork drippings
 
  After cooking the breakfast meat (bacon, ham or sausage), remove it from
  the iron skillet and put aside. To the drippings, pour 1/3 cup of strong
  coffee and stir while on the fire. Pour over hot grits or sop up with hot
  biscuits.
  
  The above is from "White Trash Cooking"; Ernest Matthew Mickler.
  
  My mother has made red-eye gravy as long as I can remember, but she does
  not use coffee in the drippings.
  
  I don't have measurements, but when the breakfast meat is done (usually
  country ham), she allows the drippings to get VERY hot in the pan (cast
  iron skillet) then pours water in and again let's this get VERY hot.
  
  Hope this combination of "techniques" is helpful.

  for 5 minutes.  Add the peppers, and stir well to coat. 3. Mix in the
  orange zest, juice, sugar and pepper.  Stir gently and cover. Cook over
  medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the peppers are wilted and
  their skins are soft, 25 minutes. 4. Remove the cover and continue cooking

  evaporated, 2 hours. 5. Serve hot or at room temperature. This keeps,
  covered tightly, in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Makes 4 cups.
  Authors' note:  This is a slightlyb swet condiment with a bite to it. Great
  served with grilled chicken or bef, sausages, lamb, on a sandwich, in a
  potato, or with game.  Try to always have some on hand--it's addictive.

      2 ts Garlic powder                       5 lg Onions (large fist size)
      3 cn Green chilis (4-5 oz size)         16 lg Tomatoes (large fist size)
    1/2    Bottle pickled jalepano             5 cn Tomato paste (5oz)

      5 lg Green peppers (large fist           1 ts Salt
 
  Chop onions, tomatoes, and peppers to bite sized pieces.  Chop jalepano
  peppers into small pieces. Chop chilis into small pieces. Mix the tomato
  paste and the water together to make thick sauce. Add the garlic, cayenne
  and salt to sauce and mix. Put all the peppers, onions,and tomatoes into a
  large oval roaster and slowly cook over low-med heat. Add the jalapeno's,
  chili's and sauce with spices in it and stir until thoroughly mixed.
  Continue cooking until everything is JUST heated. Spoon into sterilized
  quart sealers and process in boiling water bath for 20 minutes. Makes about
  7 quarts.
  
  This makes a medium spicy salsa.  If hotter salsa is desired, adjust the
  cayenne and the jalapeno peppers accordingly.  I have used this not only as
  a salsa, but also for spaghetti sauce. Just add some browned, ground meat
  and some oregano and basil! Voila, instant spaghetti sauce. This salsa won
  a ribbon in our Annual Fall Fair for me! It came in second.....

      Title: Solionye Ogurtsy - Brined Cucumbers
 Categories: Pickles
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      5 lb Cucumber, medium pickling           1    Head garlic
           -3-4" long 1 1/4" thick           1/2 oz Hot red pepper, fresh seeded
      1    Dill plant, bunch mature,           3    Tarragon, fresh branches
           -seeds included                     6 tb Salt, non-iodized, per 2 qts
      2 oz Horesradish root                         -water
 
  Preparing Cucumbers: wash the cucumbers under running water and place in a
  bowl.  Cover with ice water and enough ice to keep them cold for 10 hours.
  Drain the cucumbers and trim both ends so that the brine will more easily
  penetrate the flesh.
  
  Assembling: Rinse the dill and divide in half.  Scrub and rinse the
  horseradish and slice thinly.  Peel and halve the garlic.
  
  Fold half the dill into a ring to fit the bottom of the pickling jar. Strew
  horseradish, garlic, red pepper, and 1/3 of the tarragon on top. Arrange
  half the cucumbers upright in the jar, packing them tightly. Place the
  second third of the tarragon on top, then pack in the rest of the cucumbers
  in the same manner. Over them layer the remaining dill, horseradish,
  garlic, pepper and tarragon.
  
  Combine the salt and water, stirring until the salt dissolves. Percentage
  of salt in this brine is 5.5 to 6.5 percent. Pour the brine into the jar.
  The cucumbers and herbs should be fully submerged. Cover with a saucer and
  weight down with a jar or can filled with water. Cover the mouth of the jar
  with 2 layers of cheesecloth and tie in place with string.
  
  Fermentation and storage: For the first 2-3 days, keep the cucumbers on a
  well aired shaded patio or similar spot with a temperature of 64-68
  degrees.  Remove the scum as it appears and wash the mouth of the jar
  daily.  After 3-4 days, when the most active fermentation has subsided a
  bit, remove the weight and lid. Check to see that the brine still covers
  the cucumbers.  If not, add brine in the same proportions (1 1/4-1 3/4 Tbsp
  salt to 1 pint water). Cover the jar with its own lid and refrigerate at
  32-38 degrees.
  
  During the next 10-14 days, see that the brine does not become too cloudy
  (there is always some degree of cloudiness due to fermentation process) and
  that there is no mold.  If either does happen, replace the brine, rinse the
  upper layer of dill, wipe the mouth of the jar and close again.
  
  Store the pickles on the lowest shelf of the refrigerator. They will keep
  for up to 1 week.

           -boiled and drained                 2    Two-inch sticks cinnamon,
      3 c  White vinegar                            -broken up
    3/4 c  Light brown sugar, packed          10    To 12 whole cloves
    1/2 ts Salt                           
 
  Rinse and drain unopened day lily buds; clip off any stem remnants.  Put
  buds in a saucepan; add water barely to cover.  Bring quickly to a boil,
  cover, and simmer 20 minutes.  Drain.  (At this point, the buds can also be
  served as a simple vegetable dish after adding salt, pepper, spices, etc.
  Another thing I do with them is to stuff them with ricotta cheese and serve
  them that way.)  Anyway, back to the canning recipe!
  
  Pack hot buds into 8 sterile half-pint canning jars.
  
  Combine vinegar, brown sugar, salt, allspice, cinnamon, and cloves in a
  saucepan and bring to a boil; boil 3 minutes.
  
  Pour pickling solution over buds, distributing spices equally.  Seal at
  once.
  
  Yield:  8 half-pints.  Let these stand for a few weeks before using, to
  further develop the spicy flavor.
  
  Note:  Don't harvest day lilies within 50 feet of roadways due to
  automobile emissions.

    1/2 tb Celery seeds                      1/2 ts Dry mustard
 
  A lot of trouble, but a conversation piece when finished. Old time cooks
  called these and stuffed whole fruits "mangoes."  They were favorites in
  English-American homes because the flavor is superb with baked ham, game,
  roast pork, and with baked beans.  Serve whole as a salad, or slice and use
  as garnish.
  
  Wash all vegetables thoroughly before chopping; drain peppers; cut off tops
  and save; remove seeds and membranes.  Cover tops and peppers with water
  and bring to boiling; boil gently 10 minutes, or until almost tender.
  Drain, and let cool.  Combine chopped vegetables.  Mix remaining
  ingredients; pour over vegetables and mix well.  Stuff into peppers, do not
  pack too tightly.  Place top on each pepper.  Tie in place with string.
  Place peppers in wide mouthed jars or in a large crock or jar. Heat
  together in agate or enamel kettle all of the following ingredients except
  olive oil.
  
  3 pints cider vinegar 1 quart water 1/2 cup salt 1 Tbsp. celery seeds 1 1/2
  Tbsp. mustard seeds 4 Tbsp. whole cloves 2 Tbsp. whole allspice 1 (three
  inch) stick cinnamon, broken 2 blades mace, or 1 Tsp. ground mace Olive oil
  
  Bring spice mixture to boiling; pour over stuffed peppers.  Let cool. To
  each 3 peppers in jar or crock add about 1/2 cup olive oil.  Cover. Let
  stand in cool place 10 days or longer before using.  To serve, remove
  string, drain stuffed peppers.
  
  Note:  Use remaining oil and spice mixture in salad dressings or for
  marinade.

      Title: Super Salsa
 Categories: Sauces, Salsa
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 qt Peeled & Chopped Tomatoes           2 tb Salt
      2 c  Chopped Onion                     1/4 c  Chopped Garlic
      1 c  Chopped Jalapenos                 1/4 c  Cornstarch
    1/4 c  Sugar                                    Water
 
  Combine vegetables and seasonings in a large saucepan. Dissolve cornstarch
  in just enough water to make a smooth paste; add to vegetable mixture and
  stir thoroughly. Simmer 45 minutes. Refrigerate. Recipe can be halved.
  
  To can, place in individual jars and process 10 minutes in boiling water
  bath.
  
  NOTE: To aid in peeling tomatoes, place each tomato in hot water for a few
  moments just before attempting to peel.
  
  You can halve the entire recipe if you want, but if so, be sure to halve
  the Jalapeno & garlic! This is easy and VERY tasty!... I'm not much into
  super hot salsa either, but I usually decrease the Jalapeno & Garlic to
  make this recipe just strong enough to make me sweat!! ;)

    1/2 c  Plus 2 Tablespoons light       
 
  Info:  from "Eat More, Weigh Less", by Dean Ornish M.D., 1993 Harper
  Collins recipe by Wolfgang Puck typed for you by Perry Lowell, GOURMET,
  July '93 The length of time it takes for the ketchup to thicken depends on
  the water content of the tomatos, so be patient.  Make only with
  vine-ripened tomatos.
  
  Makes 2 cups.
  
  In a medium stainless-steep or enamel saucepan, over a low flame, cook the
  tomatos and garlic until the sauce begins to bubble.  Add the onion and red
  pepper and cook 1 to 2 minutes.  Stir in the corn syrup, vinegar, salt, and
  pickling spices and continue to simmer over the low flame until the sauce
  reduces and thickens, about 1-1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.  (The sauce
  will reduce by about one-half.)  Do not rush.  Cook over a low flame to
  prevent scorching.
  
  Strain through a food mill and stir in the tomato paste.  Correct seasoning
  to taste, cool, and refrigerate in a covered container until needed. The
  ketchup will thicken slightly as it cools, but it is not the consistency of
  store-bought ketchup.  The ketchup will keep up to three weeks.

      6 c  Zucchini-peeled and grated          5 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Water                              13 oz Crushed pineapple

  Source: FOODday, July 9, '91 From: Valerie Whittle
  
  This spicy marinade owes its unusual flavor to the chipotle, a smoked
  jalapeno chile.  Chipotles are usually sold canned in tomato paste. Look
  for them at Mexican and Latin American markets.  Adobo marinade goes
  particularly well with pork.
  
  Juice the oranges and lime.  Finely chop chilies and garlic.  Place citrus
  juices, chilies, garlic, oregano, cumin, black pepper, vinegar and salt in
  blender and puree until smooth.
  
  Makes enough marinade for 1 1/2 to 2 pounds meat or chicken.

      1 c  Slightly pureed Anasazi           1/4 c  Chopped green onion
           Beans *                             1 c  Grated cheddar
    1/2 c  Cooked rice                         1 c  Grated Monterey Jack

    1/4 c  Chopped bell pepper                10    Corn tortillas
 
  Mix first five ingredients together. Add 2 T. enchilada sauce.  Moisten
  tortillas in warmed enchilada sauce. Fill tortilla with mixture and roll.
  Place in greased 6 1/2" X 10 1/2" pan with the opening of the roll down.
  Any remaining sauce should be poured on top of the enchiladas once the pan
  is filled. Place cheeses on top and bake at 300 degrees F for 35-40
  minutes.
  
  *  "Anasazi" is a Navajo word meaning "ancient one."  Anasazi beans have
  been found in many southwestern Indian dwellings.  Bean connoisseurs will
  appreciate the characteristic taste and texture talents of pinto and kidney
  combined within this ancient Indian entrant. Versatility of this variety is
  limited only by your imagination: take them for a "dip": enlist them for
  creative Mexican food construction: they even taste good straight!

      1 lb Shrimp, raw                    
 
  Use a 3-quart casserole with lid.  An earthenware casserole is preferable,
  especially if you wish to add a touch of Spain to a dinner party. However,
  I know that good earthenware is hard to find today.  I have 2 casseroles
  that I've had for 15 years.
  
  Heat oil in casserole.  Saute onion and pepper until transparent.  Add
  garlic, parsley, tomato, bay leaf, nutmeg, cumin and thyme.  Mix well,
  cover, and cook over low heat until mushy (about 15 minutes).  The saffron
  should be toasting on the lid in the little brown paper.
  
  Add the shrimp to the saute and cook until it turns pink.  Dissolve the
  saffron in the 1 cup hot water.  Combine with wine, lemon juice, salt and
  hot sauce.  Pour into casserole, stir to mix, and cook covered 10 minutes
  more.  Now add the rice and the 2 1/2 cups of water.  Distribute
  ingredients well in casserole.  Bring to a quick boil, STIR ONCE, and place
  in preheated 325 degree F. oven for only 20 minutes - NI UN MINUTO MAS!
  Remove from oven, uncover, and garnish with peas, pimientos, and parsley.
  Pour beer over all.  Cover again and allow to stand 15 minutes longer,
  before serving.

  leave to soak for 10 minutes.  Drain, rinse in cold water, and drain again.
  
  Heat the oil in a heavy pan.  Give the rice a final shake and stir into the
  fat.  Fry over medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring almost
  continuously.  Add the onion and garlic and continue frying until the rice
  is just turning a pale gold and the onion is transparent - about 3 to 5
  minutes longer.
  
  Pour in the broth and, if used, the vegetables and parsley or fresh
  chilies, add salt to taste, stir once again for the last time, and cook
  over fairly high heat, uncovered, until all the broth has been absorbed and
  air holes appear in the surface. Cover the surface of the rice with a towel
  and lid and continue cooking over very low heat for 5 minutes more. Remove
  from the heat and set aside in a warm place for the rice to absorb the rest
  of the moisture in the steam and swell - about 15 minutes. Dig gently to
  the bottom and test a grain of rice.  If it is still damp, cook for a few
  minutes longer.  If the top grains are not quite soft, then sprinkle with a
  little more hot broth, cover, and cook for a few minutes longer.
  
  Before serving, turn the rice over from the bottom so that the flavored
  juices will be distributed evenly.

      4 c  Chicken broth                            Green Rice
 
  Put the rice into a bowl and pour very hot water over to cover; stir and
  set aside for 10 minutes.  Drain in a strainer and rinse in cold water;
  drain again and set aside.
  
  Heat the oil in a heavy pan, stir the rice into it, and fry over fairly
  high heat, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan, for about 5
  minutes.  Add the onion and chile strips and continue frying for 4 minutes
  or until the onion is translucent.
  
  Meanwhile, put 1 cup of the broth into a blender jar; add the garlic,
  parsley, and epazote and blend until smooth.  Add this to the frying rice
  and continue frying and reducing the puree over quite high heat, stirring
  and scraping the bottom of the pan, until the rice is dry. Stir in the rest
  of the broth, add salt to taste, and cook over fairly high heat, uncovered,
  until the liquid has been absorbed and there are air holes in the rice.
  Cover with a towel and lid and continue cooking over low heat for 5
  minutes.  Remove from the heat and set aside, still covered, in a warm
  place for the rice to swell up.  Before serving, turn the rice over with a
  fork from the bottom where a lot of the flavor and oil will have settled.

      Title: Atole - Atole De Zarzamora
 Categories: Mexican, Beverages
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Jim Vorheis                              -scant 1/2 cup masa harina
      2 lb Wild blackberries                        -mixed with 1/3 cup water
      2 c  Cold water                        2/3 c  Water
    1/2 c  Cold water                      1 1/2 c  Warm milk
      3 oz Tortilla masa (1/3 cup)         1 1/2 c  Warm water
      3 tb Crushed piloncillo or           1 1/2 oz Tablet drinking chocolate
           -dark brown sugar to taste          1    3-inch cinnamon stick
    1/2 c  Prepared tortilla masa, or          3 tb Brown sugar, or to taste
 
  Though there are many variations, basically "atole" is a gruel thickened
  with masa, sweetened with raw sugar, and flavored with crushed fruits -
  such as pineapple and strawberries - or seasoned with chili. Some are made
  with a base of ground rice; others with fresh corn. For the Mexicans atole,
  too, is a natural accompaniment for tamales. For non-Mexicans, however, it
  is really not the sort of beverage that would generally be accepted, no
  matter how authentic.
  
  Blackberry atole Put the blackberries and water into a saucepan and cook
  over a medium flame, pressing them down from time to time, for about 10
  minutes.  Puree the blackberries in a blender or food processor and press
  through a fine sieve, or the fine disk of a food mill, to extract the
  seeds, and return to the pan.
  
  Add the water to the masa and press out any lumps with the back of a wooded
  spoon.  When it is quite smooth, stir it into the strained blackberries.
  Cook over low heat, stirring often until the atole begins to thicken.
  
  Add the sugar and stir until dissolved.  It should take about 25 minutes to
  reach the required consistency, so that the mixture will very lightly coat
  the back of a wooden spoon.
  
  Champurrado (Chocolate-flavored atole)
  
  Put the masa into the pan with the 2/3 cup water and cook over a low flame,
  stirring constantly, until it thickens - about 5 minutes.
  
  Gradually stir in the milk and water and cook until it begins to bubble.
  Add the chocolate, broken into pieces, the cinnamon stick, and the sugar
  and cook slowly, stirring, until the mixture thickens - about 15 minutes.
  The atole is done when a spoonful slides noiselessly rather than plops back
  into the mixture.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Cabeza, beef head                        3heads garlic
      4    Onions                              2 bn Cilantro
 
  corn or flour tortillas
  
  Before you actually get the cabeza (beef head), understand that it won't
  look very nice -in fact it will look pretty gruesome.  Therefore, I suggest
  purchasing the thing the day you cook it.
  
  In the Rio Grande Valley, barbacoa de cabeza is traditionally eaten on
  Sunday mornings.
  
  Clean the cabeza, removing eyes, ears, etc.  Discard the tongue. Leaving it
  will impart an odd taste to the meat.  Wrap the cabeza in a paper sack,
  along with onions, garlic, and cilantro.  Wrap THAT in burlap.
  
  Dig a hole 2 feet deep and build a driftwood fire in it.  Wait until the
  fire goes to coals, then cover them with ashes, followed by the cabeza,
  then about 2 inches of dry dirt or sand.  Fill up the hole.  Add 6 to 8
  inches of dirt or sand over it.  Build a fire on top of the ground.  Use
  slow-burining wood such as oak or mesquite.
  
  Leave the cabeza in the hole 12 to 18 hours.  For example, if you begin
  cooking it at 4:00 p.m., it should be ready by the next morning.  Serve
  with tortillas.
  
  Serves one vanload.
  
  If you want to try barbacoa de cabeza at homne, try wrapping the cabeza in
  foil and bakinng it in an oven or over a charcoal grill.  Using foil in
  place of the paper bag keeps the cabeza slightly moister while

      Title: Bean Burrito Layers
 Categories: Beans, Vegetarian, Mexican
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 c  Green Lentils; dried                1 tb Chili Powder
    1/4 c  Pinto Beans; dried                1/4 c  Coriander Leaves; chopped
    1/4 c  Red Kidney Beans; dried             6 oz Monterey Jack Cheese; grated
    1/4 c  Baby Lima Beans; dried              6    Flour Tortillas; 10"
      1    Onion; medium                       1    Tomato; medium, chopped
      4    Garlic Cloves                       1    Lettuce; shredded
      2    Jalapeno Peppers *                  1    Salsa
      1 tb Oregano; dried                 
 
  Servings:  4
  
  Rinse lentils and beans, discarding any that look suspicious, and soak in
  clean water 4 - 6 hours, or overnight.  Put into medium saucepan, bring to
  boil and simmer, covered, 30 minutes.  Add water if necessary.
  
  Peel and chop onion.  Microwave on "High" 2 - 2 1/2 minutes until soft. [If
  you prefer, you may saute the onion in about 2 T. oil.  I omit the oil to
  keep the fat content down.  The flavour does not seem to suffer.] Chop the
  Jalapena pepper.  (*) Adjust the quantity to your own taste and / or
  tolerance.
  
  Peel and crush the garlic.
  
  Drain the lentil-bean mixture.  Reserve 1/2 cup of liquor.  In a food
  processor puree the lentil-bean mixture, the onion, the garlic, the
  jalapena peppers, the oregano, the chile powder, and the coriander leaves,
  adding some of the reserved liquor as necessary to process.  [The final
  puree should be quite thick.]
  
  Pre-heat the oven to 325 F.
  
  Assemble as follows on an oven-proof plate, pizza-pan or cookie-sheet:
  
  Place a flour tortilla on the *lightly* greased surface. Cover with
  lentil-bean puree [4 - 5 T.].  Sprinkle with Monterey Jack cheese. Add
  another flour tortilla and repeat, saving enough cheese to cover the top of
  the final flour tortilla.  Bake for 20 - 30 minutes.
  
  Remove from oven and allow to "firm-up" for 5 - 10 minutes before serving.
  
  Garnish with salsa, chopped tomato and shredded lettuce.  Serve with rice,
  Couscous and / or corn.
  
  The amount of oregano, coriander leaves, chile powder, or jalapena peppers
  may be varied to suit individual tastes.  I use more peppers!  If you're
  prone to "problems" with beans, add 1/4 - 1/2 t. Hing [Hing is a mixture of
  rice-flour, turmeric and asafoetida <ass-uh-fuh-TEE-duh> found in most
  East-Indian specialty stores.  It can significantly reduce flatulence.

      Title: Birria (Seasoned and Baked Meat)
 Categories: Appetizers, Mexican, Lamb
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      8    To 10 servings                 
 
  It is a really rustic dish. Usually a whole goat or lamb, although in some
  places just the offal, is seasoned with a paste of ground spices and chiles
  and cooked in a pit barbecue. As you wander around Guadalajara at night,
  you can see that tacos of birria head the list of antojitos on the
  street-side stands and always appear prominently on the Sunday menus of the
  smaller regional restaurants. Here is a family version of birria, with the
  variety of chiles used in Zacatecas, rather than the plain chilacate or
  ancho used in Jalisco.
  
  One day ahead: 2 lamb shanks A veal breast A lamb breast 3 pounds loin of
  pork 2 tbs salt 6 chiles anchos 3 chiles guajillos 10 chiles cascabel 18
  peppercorns                    4 whole cloves 1/4 tsp oregano Scant 1/4 tsp
  cumin seeds 1/4 cup vinegar 2 tsp salt 6 cloves garlic, peeled 1/2 small
  onion Directions: There will be approximately 6 to 7 pounds of meat. Slash
  the meats in several places down to the bone and rub the salt well into it.
  Meanwhile, prepare the chili paste. Heat the comal and toast the chiles
  lightly, turning them from time to time so that they will not burn. Remove
  the veins and seeds. Put the chiles to soak in hot water for about 20
  minutes, then transfer with a slotted spoon to the blender jar, add the
  rest of the ingredients, and blend to a smooth sauce. Cover the meat
  thickly with the paste and set it aside to season for about 18 hours.
  
  On serving day: 1 1/2 cups water The meat Flour and water paste 2 pounds
  tomatoes, broiled 1 cup onion, finely chopped 1/2 tsp oregano Preheat the
  oven to 350 degrees. Put the water into the bottom of a large Dutch oven or
  casserole with a tightly fitting lid and place the meat on a rack so that
  it is just above the water. Seal the lid with a paste of flour and water
  and cook for about 3 1/2 to 4 hours, by which time the meat should be
  almost falling off the bones. Strain off the juices from the bottom of the
  pan, cool, and skim off the fat. There should be about 2 cups of juices
  left- if not, make it up to 2 cups with water. Blend the tomatoes to a
  smooth sauce. Put the sauce and the skimmed juices from the meat into a
  saucepan and bring to a boil. Serve each portion of mixed meats in a deep
  bowl. Pour 1/2 cup sauce over the meat and sprinkle with the chopped onion
  and oregano. Eat with tortillas.

  The word birria means something deformed or grotesque, and it is used col-
  loquially in the northwest to mean a mess or failure.  This certainly looks
  a mess when it is cooked, but it is a very savory one.
  
  It is a really rustic dish.  Usually a whole goat or lamb, although in some
  places just the offal, is seasoned with a paste of ground spices and
  chilies and cooked in a pit barbecue.
  
  One day ahead: There will be approximately 6 to 7 pounds of meat. Slash the
  meats in several places down to the bone and rub the salt well into it.
  Meanwhile, prepare the chili paste. Heat the comal (or griddle) and toast
  the chilies lightly, turning them from time to time so that they will not
  burn.  Remove the veins and seeds. Put the chilies to soak in hot water for
  abt. 20 minutes, then transfer with a slotted spoon to the blender jar, add
  the rest of the ingredients, and blend to a smooth sauce. Cover the meat
  thickly with the paste and set it aside to season for about 18 hours.
  
  On serving day: Preheat the oven to 350F. Put the water in the bottom of a
  large Dutch over or casserole with a tightly fitting lid and place the meat
  on a rack so the it is just about the water. Seal the lid with a paste of
  flour and water and cook for about 3 1/2 to 4 hours, by which time the meat
  should be almot falling off the bones.
  
  Strain off the juices from the bottom of the pan, cool, and skim off the
  fat.  There should be about 2 cups of juices left-if not, make it up with
  up to 2 cups of water.  Blend the tomatoes to a smooth sauce. Put the sauce
  and the skimmed juices from the meat into a saucepan and bring to a boil.
  
  Serve each portion of mixed meats in a deep bowl.  pour 1/2 cup of sauce
  over the meat and sprinkle with the chopped onion and oregano.  Eat with
  tortillas.  Makes 8 to 10 servings.

      Title: Broiled Tomatoes (Mexican)
 Categories: Mexican, Sauces
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Tomatoes                       
 
  Many Mexican recipes call for tomatoes to be asados (roasted).
  Traditionally they are put onto a hot comal and cooked until the skin is
  wrinkled and brown and the flesh is soft right through--this takes about 20
  to 25 minutes for an 8 ounce tomato.  However, since this method is very
  messy, it is best to line a shallow metal pan with foil and put the
  tomatoes in it.  Place them under a hot broiler--do not have the flame too
  high or the tomato will burn without cooking through--and turn them from
  time to time so that they cook through evenly--the skin will be blistered
  and charred.  A medium tomato will take about 20 minutes.  Blend the
  tomato, skin, core, and seeds to a fairly smoothe sauce.  The skin and core
  give both body and flavor to the sauce.  And never mind if the skin ~is-
  charred; that adds character, too.  If the skin is very badly blackened and
  hard in places, then remove a little of it.  This method of cooking
  tomatoes makes for a very rich-flavored sauce. FromThe Cuisines of Mexico
  by Diana Kennedy, 1972.

  1.  In a medium-size saucepan, heat the oil, add the chopped onion, and fry
  over medium heat until the onion is translucent. Add tomato juice, garlic,
  chiles, herbs, and salt.  Reduce heat to simmer for about 10 minutes. Sauce
  can be made a day or hours ahead of time and left at this point.
  
  2.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Warm the tortillas by wrapping in foil
  and placing on the 4 serving plates (Mexican pottery if possible) in the
  warm oven.  At the same time, warm the extra tortillas you are serving as
  bread.
  
  3.  Poach the eggs, using an egg poacher or a frying pan of hot water with
  2 tablespoons vinegar and 1 teaspoon salt added. First break an egg into a
  cup, then stir the water in the frying pan vigorously in a circular motion.
  As you stir, slide the egg from the cup into the water. Cover the pan when
  all eggs have been added.
  
  4.  To assemble the dish, place a tortilla on a plate.  Top with a circle
  of avocado slices, then arrange a drained poached egg (or 2 eggs) on top,
  spoon sauce over, and sprinkle with cheese. Place in the oven until cheese
  melts.  Add the lettuce garnish after the cheese has melted.
  
  Variation: Instead of the tortillas, rinse large "cupped" iceberg lettuce
  leaves and serve the eggs topped with sauce in the lettuce leaves.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      2 ts Vanilla extract                
 
  1.  Preheat the oven to 300F.  In a small saucepan, combine the granulated
  sugar with 1 tablespoon water.  Stir over moderate heat until the sugar
  turns a medium caramel color, about 3 minutes. Working quickly, pour the
  caramel into six (6-oz.) custard cups; don't worry   if they're not evenly
  coated.
  
  2.  In a medium bowl, beat the eggs.  Whisk in the brown sugar, vanilla and
  almond extract. Gradually whisk in the evaporated and whole milk.  Strain
  the mixture through a sieve and then pour it into the custard cups.  Place
  the cups in a baking pan and add enough hot water to reach halfway up the
  sides.  Bake for about 1 hour or until set.  Let the flans cool to room
  temperature in the water bath. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
  
  3.  Run a knife tip around the edge of each flan and invert onto dessert
  plates.  Serve cold.

      4 c  Garlic, minced                 
 
  1. Place chilies in small bowl with boiling water, let stand 1 hour 2. Heat
  lard or oil in Dutch oven over med. heat until hot. Add 2 lamb shanks. Cook
  turning often, until brown on all sides about 20 minutes. Remove to plate.
  Repeat. 3. Place chilies and 1/3 cup of the soaking liquid in a blender and
  process until smooth. Discard remaining soaking liquid. 4. Remove and
  discard all but 2 TBS oil from Dutch oven. Add onions and saute' over
  medium heat about 4 mins. or until soft. Reduce heat to med-low and stir in
  raisins, sugar, garlic, oregano and cumin. Add chili puree and cook
  stirring constantly for 2 minutes. 5. Add tomatoes, stock and bay leaves to
  pan. Heat to boiling. Add lamb shanks and simmer over low heat, covered,
  turning occasionally until lamb is very, very tender--about 2 to 2/12
  hours/ 6. Remove lamb to serving platter and keep warm. Skim and discard
  fat from cooking sauce. Stir in vinegar. Heat sauce to boiling over
  med.-high heat and cook uncovered, stirring frequently until sauce is
  thickened--about 10 minutes. Spoon sauce over lamb. Serve, garnished with
  lettuce and olives (Maybe even some quartered tomatoes). Accompany with
  Refried Beans garnished as desired with shredded cheese and diced white
  onions. I recommend with shanks that you clean them as well as possible of
  as much fat as possible plus that white membrane. Don't remove all the
  membrane, however, as something has to hold them together.

  Mexicans perfer to use fat fish as mackerel or pompano for ceviche. Limes
  are preferred, although lemons may be used, since both contain the citric
  acid that "cooks" the fish. (According to Elisabeth Lambert Ortiz, The

      Title: Chayote Relleno
 Categories: Desserts, Mexican

      3 sm Chayotes (about 6 ounces        1 1/2 c  Sponge cake or pound cake,
           -each)                                   -crumbled into fine crumbs,
    1/2 c  Almonds                                  Plus 2 tablespoons for
    1/2 c  Sugar                                    -topping (see note)
      3    Eggs                              1/2 c  Golden sultana or black
      1 tb Brandy                                   -raisins
      1 ts Vanilla                             3 tb Slivered almonds
      2 tb Milk or cream                       1 c  Softly whipped cream, barely
      1 pn Nutmeg                                   -sweetened
 
  This is a use for chayote that I would never have thought of, but it sounds
  really good.
  
  I love to shock people with the unexpected, such as serving these stuffed
  chayote shells for dessert. In this recipe, chayote's delicate texture and
  taste combine with almonds, sugar, brandy, eggs, cream, raisins and sponge
  cake to make an elegant pudding-like filling for the pale-green shells.
  They are abso- lutely delicious and something you might have been served in
  one of the fine old households of colonial Mexico.
  
  Cut the chayote in half lengthwise and steam for 35 minutes, or until just
  tender. Do not overcook--you don't want the shells to collapse when you
  scoop them out.
  
  Meanwhile, combine the almonds and sugar in a food processor and grind
  until the almonds are fairly fine.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
  
  When the chayote is cooked and cool enough to handle, remove the seed, and
  scoop out the pulp, leaving a 1/2-inch-thick shell. Set aside.
  
  Place the chayote pulp in the processor with the ground almonds; add eggs
  and process to a puree. Add the brandy, vanilla and milk or cream. Blend.
  Pour mixture into a bowl and stir in nutmeg, cake crumbs and raisins.
  
  Spoon the pudding mixture into the chayote shells (you will have about 1
  1/2 cups left over) and place them in a greased baking dish. Sprinkle
  slivered almonds and reserved cake crumbs over the tops. Bake stuffed
  shells for 30 minutes. Pour remaining pudding mixture into a greased loaf
  pan and bake for 25 minutes.
  
  Serve warm, topped with whipped cream.
  
  Serves 6 lucky people. (The pudding loaf serves 4.)
  
  Note: I cheat and buy a frozen pound cake to use for this recipe.

           -diced                            1/2 ts Red chile powder, for
      1 c  Frozen or fresh corn kernels             -garnish
           -(cut from 2 ears of corn)     
 
  In this dish, each vegetable beautifully complements the other. Serve as a
  vegetarian entree or as an accompaniment to grilled meats.
  
  Saute the onion in olive oil in a 2-quart saucepan.
  
  Meanwhile, peel the chayotes (chayote has a very thin skin and is easy to
  peel with a swivel-blade peeler), then cut each in half, scoop out and
  discard the seed, and dice the flesh. Add to the saucepan, along with the
  diced chiles, corn, salt, pepper and milk. Cover, and simmer gently for
  about 15 minutes, or until chayote is tender. Stir in the Parmesan and cook
  a few seconds until the sauce thickens.
  
  Transfer to a serving bowl and sprinkle with cheddar cheese and chile
  powder.
  
  Serves 4.

  1 1/2 c  Coarsely shredded Monterey          2 lg Eggs
           -Jack cheese with                   1 c  Vegetable oil
           Jalapeno peppers ( 8 ounces)             Guacamole and/or salsa
      2 ts Dried oregano, crumbled        
 
  Place each chicken breast half between waxed paper and pound very thin with
  a mallet or rolling pin to form a "cutlet".  Be careful not to pound holes
  in the meat. Place 1/3 cup cheese in center of each "cutlet"; sprinkle with
  oregano.  Fold sides over to seal cheese, then roll up.  Hold in place with
  wooden toothpick. Combine cornmeal with chili powder on sheet of waxed
  paper; place flour on another. Beat eggs slightly in a pie plate. Coat the
  stuffed rolls with flour; dip in egg then cornmeal mixture to coat well.
  Chill at least an hour.  (This much of the preparation can be done ahead).
  Preheat oven to 350 F. In a large skillet, heat oil until very hot. Quickly
  brown the stuffed chicken rolls, turning often, until golden. Lift out with
  a slotted spoon; drain well.  Place in a shallow baking pan. Bake 20
  minutes or until juices run clear when pierced with a small knife. Serve
  with guacamole and/or salsa.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

    1/2 lb (about 1 large) tomatoes,         3/4 lb Chicken livers
           -broiled                            3 tb Melted chicken fat or

  Put the unpeeled tomatoes, garlic, and chilies into a blender jar and blend
  until almost smooth; there should be a little texture to the sauce. Set
  aside.
  
  Trim the livers of any connective tissue and any greenish spots from the
  bile duct; cut each one into six parts.  Heat the fat in a frying pan, add
  the liver pieces and onion, sprinkle lightly with salt, and fry, tossing
  them almost constantly - a stir-fry if you will- for about 3 minutes over
  high heat.  Add the blended ingredients and, still over high heat, cook for
  about 5 minutes or until the sauce has reduced and seasoned. Adjust
  seasoning.

      Title: Chile Dusted Duck with South of the Border Stuffing
 Categories: Poultry, Spices/etc., Mexican, Hot
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      5    Jalapeno chiles, stems and               -Smith apples
           -seeds removed, chopped             2 c  1/2-inch bread cubes
      1 c  Diced onion                       1/2 c  Pinon nuts
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine               1/3 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
      2 c  Peeled and chopped Granny      
 
  Info:  from December 1992 "Chile Pepper Spicy World Cuisine" magazine
  posted by Perry Lowell, Mar. '93
  
  Roast duck with stuffing is as easy to prepare as a turkey or a chicken,
  though it is doubtful that the Conquistadors at the first Thanksgiving took
  the time to stuff the ducks before roasting.  In these days of lean and no
  fat meals, many people refuse to consider duck becuase it is perceived as
  being extremely fatty.  Several simple steps, however, can greatly reduce
  the fat content.  First, if the skin is pricked before cooking, much of the
  fat will drain off. Secondly, removing the skin before serving will lower
  the fat content even further.
  
  (1) 4-1/2 to 5 pound duck, remove giblets and neck from inside wash and pat
  dry ground red chile powder
  
  Sprinkle the inside cavity of the duck with salt.
  
  Saute the chiles and onion in the margarine until soft.
  
  Combine the mixture with the apples, bread cubes, nuts, and cilantro, and
  toss gently to mix. Fill the neck and body cavities loosely with stuffing.
  Skewer the neck shut and cover the opening of the body cavity with aluminum
  foil and tie the legs together. To be safe, do not stuff until you are
  ready to cook.
  
  Place the duck on a rack in a shallow roasting pan.  With sharp fork, prick
  the skin at 1-inch intervals, being careful not to prick the meat or it
  will dry out. This is to allow the duck to continuously self-baste so you
  can put it in the oven and forget it.
  
  Dust the duck with the chile powder.  Bake in slow oven, 325 degrees F.,
  about 3 hours or to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F.
  
  Serves:  2 to 4 Heat Scale: Mild

      Title: Chimicangas
 Categories: Ground beef, Mexican, Beef
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Ground beef                       1/2 c  Enchilada sauce (canned is
      1 md Sized chopped onion                      -fine)
 
  first, make the meat filling Brown the meat and drain. Add the onion, cook
  until soft.  Add the
  
  sauce and let simmer for 10 minutes Now you're ready to really start. 12
  flour tortillas(7 inches in diameter) 2 1/4 cups of meat filling(from
  above) 1 1/2 to 2 cups each of shredded cheddar cheese, shredded lettuce,
  and chopped green onions or radishes Sour cream
  
  Spoon 3 tablespoons of the filling down the center of tortilla.
  
  Fold tortilla around filling, and fasten with wooden toothpicks.  Assemble
  only 2 or 3 at a time, or the tortilla will absorb liquid from the filling.
  Fry in 1 inch of hot oul over medium heat (350degrees), turning,
  
  until golden; takes 1 to 2 minutes.  Lift from fat with a slotted spoon,
  draining, then place on a thick layer of paper towels; keep in a warm place
  until all are cooked. Serve garnished with 2 or 3 tablespoons each shredded
  cheese, lettuce,
  
  and radishes or green onions, and add sour cream to taste. Do not forget to
  remove the toothpicks before serving.  I've done
  
  it once, and it is extremely painful. These aren't quite like the ones you
  get in restaurants, because
  
  they use huge platter-sized tortillas.  They are still a grease maniac's
  dream--very greasy, very tasty.  You can use animal fat or lard to fry up
  the chimichangas, I believe, but I would suggest using vegetable oil. It
  works just fine, and the other way will probably cause a cholesterol
  overload.  Otherwise, it's fantastic.

  ..I [=Jane Butel] have generally made bulk sausage, as it is much easier.
  Sausage has to be taken out of the casing for most uses anyway.
  
  1.  Clean the casings, rinse well with water, then pour vinegar through
  them.  Set aside.
  
  2.  Use a food processor or the coarse blade of a meat grinder, grind the
  meat and fat.  Add the onions, garlic, vinegar, tequila and seasonings,
  using the hotness of chile powder your family and guests will prefer.
  
  3.  Stuff the casings.  First cut the casings into 3-ft lengths and tie one
  end together.  Use either a funnel or filling tube to fill the lengths. Tie
  at about 4-inch intervals with heavy thread.
  
  4.  Place on a cookie sheet covered with wax paper.  Set on the counter for
  about 2 hours, then refrigerate.
  
  5.  After a day, freeze what you will not use within a week or two. Mixture
  should ripen for at least 8 hours before using.
  
  Notes:  If you have no food processor or grinder, buy triple ground pork.
  Prepare the recipe once and taste for the mildness or hotness of the ground
  red chile.  Adjust to suit your taste for the next time you make sausage.
  
  Freezing hints: Mold the sausage into 1/2-pound lumps and freeze between
  pieces of foil inside a heavy plastic bag.
  
  Maximum recommended freezer storage:  3 months.
  
  Makes 20 sausages or  2 2/3 pounds bulk sausage.

      Title: Chorizos (Mexican Sausage)
 Categories: Pork/ham, Mexican, Sausages
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      2 lb Pork tenderloin (ground ok)       1/2 lb Pork fat
      5    Chiles anchos                       2    Chilies pasilla
    1/2 ts Coriander seeds (toasted)           3    Cloves
    1/2 ts Peppercorns                       1/2 ts Oregano (Mexican Blended)
    1/8 ts Cumin seeds                         4    Garlic cloves (peel/crush)
      2 tb Sweet paprika                   2 1/2 ts Salt
    2/3 c  Mild white vinegar                  2 fl Vodka (if wanted)
 
  Chop the meat roughly, (or purchase ground pork), together with the fat.
  
  Toast the chilies well, turning them from time to time so they do not burn.
  While they are still warm and flexible, slit them open and remove the seeds
  and veins.  As they cool off they will become crisp.
  
  Grind the spices together withe the chilies.
  
  Mix the ground spices and chilies with the rest of the ingredients and rub
  them well into the meat with your hands.
  
  Cover the mixture and set it aside in the refrigerator to season for 3
  days, stirring it well each day. (Before using, fry a little of the meat
  and taste to see if it has enough salt and seasoning.)
  
  Normally the meat would be put into sausage casings, however, I just use it
  straight from the bowl.  If you don't want to stuff the meat into casings
  at all, leave it to mature for about a week.  Store it in containers in the
  freezer compartment of the refrigerator.

  half lengthwise so that it is 1/2-inch wide. Gently roll to round and
  lengthen each strip to rope 1/4 to 1/2 inch in diameter. Hold one end of
  each rope firmly and wind dough loosely around to form coil. Tuck end
  underneath. Place on greased baking sheets about 2 inches apart. Repeat
  with remaining dough. Cover and let rise in warm place until doubled. Heat
  honey until thin. Gently brush rolls with half of honey and sprinkle with
  almonds. Bake at 400øF 15 minutes or until browned. Remove from baking
  sheets and cool on wire racks. Drizzle while hot with remaining honey.

  Put the corn and milk into a food processor and process for 10 to 15
  seconds or until reduced to a textured puree.  Beat the butter until creamy
  and gradually add the corn and the eggs, one by one, beating after each
  addition.  Add the sugar and salt.
  
  Pour the mixture into the prepared dish and bake until the mixture is
  firmly set and beginning to brown around the edges - about 35 minutes.
  
  Either serve from the dish or carefully unmold onto a serving dish.
  
  * Starchy field corn works best, ears of corn left intact that have been
  picked a few days earlier, for the starches to heighten, can be used.

      2 tb Vegetable Oil                     1/4 c  Half-and-Half
      8 oz Chorizo Sausage; Bulk             1/2 ts Oregano Leaves; Dried
 
  Cook and stir the onion in oil in a 10-inch skillet until tender but not
  brown.  Add the sausage, cooking and stirring , until the sausage is done
  then drain.  Mix the eggs, half-and-half and the oregano well with a fork.
  Pour into the sausage mixture in the skillet.  Cook over medium heat.  As
  the mixture begins to set at the bottom and sides, gently lift the cooked
  portion with a fork or spatula so that the uncooked egg mixture can run
  under the cooked portion.  Avoid constant stirring as this will make the
  eggs tough and hard.  Cook until all the eggs are cooked but still moist,
  about 3 to 5 minutes.

      Title: Empanaditas  (Pork Turnovers)
 Categories: Mexican, Pork/ham
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      8 ts Chilled margarine                   2 oz Monterey Jack or Cheddar
    3/4 c  All-purpose flour                        -cheese, shredded
      3 tb Ice water                           1 ts Prepared spicy brown mustard
      2 oz Cooked ground pork, crumbled        1 ds Crushed red pepper

  Paprika Garnish: red bell pepper strips and cilantro leaves
  
  In small bowl, with pastry blender or 2 knives, cut margarine into flour
  until mixture resembles corn meal; sprinkle with ice water and, using fork,
  mix to form soft dough.  Roll dough between 2 sheets of wax paper to form
  rectangle about 1/4 inch thick; remove paper and use 2-inch diameter plain
  or fluted cookie cutter to cut dough into rounds.  Roll scraps of dough and
  continue cutting until all dough has been used (should yield 24 rounds).
  Combine pork (or ham), cheese, mustard, and red pepper in small bowl and
  set aside.  Preheat oven to 375.
  
  Beat egg white lightly and brush an equal amount onto each pastry round.
  Spoon an equal amount of the meat mixture (about 1/2 rounded teaspoon) onto
  center of each round; fold pastry over, turnover-fashion, to enclose
  filling.  Press edges of dough together to seal.  Transfer turnovers to
  nonstick cookie sheet.  Add milk to egg yolk and beat lightly; brush an
  equal amount of mixture over each turnover and sprinkle each with a dash of
  paprika.  Bake until turnovers are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer
  to warmed serving tray; garnish with red pepper strips and cilantro. Chili
  sauce or salsa can be served as a dipping sauce.
  
  Makes 8 servings of 3 turnovers each.

      Title: Eva's Beans
 Categories: Beans, Mexican
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Pinto beans *                       1 tb Ground cumin
      1 lg White onion, chopped               12 oz Beer
      4    To 5 fresh tomatoes, peeled,             Water ***
           -seeded and chopped **              1 bn Cilantro, chopped
      1 lb Lean bacon, cut into squares        2    To 12 fresh jalapeno
      1 tb Mexican oregano                          -peppers, seeded, cut into
      1    Sprig Epasote                            -fine slivers.
 
  Salt to taste
  
  *(NOT soaked, but rinsed well, and the rocks, etc.picked out) **
  (substitute canned, if you like) *** to cover the beans by about 2 inches
  (you may need to add more HOT water as they cook)
  
  In a large pot, put the beans, bacon, oregano and cumin.  Add the beer, and
  water.  Simmer until the beans are almost tender (maybe 1 - 1 1/2 hours).
  Add the tomatoes and jalapenos, and cook until beans are fully tender. Add
  the cilantro, and re-heat for about a half hour.  Salt to taste.
  
  These make a good basic bean.  If you want a bean soup, remove about a
  quarter of the beans, and mash with a potato masher.  Return to the pot.
  
  Eva insisted that these beans HAD to be consumed the same day they were
  cooked.  I've found they will be almost as good reheated the next day, and
  if drained of most of their liquid, they make killer refried beans.
  
  She served them as a separate course, after the meat -- I like them as an
  accompaniment to grilled or barbecued meat, or as a meal in themselves,
  when served with a lot of fresh tortillas or homemade bread.

      Title: Flan
 Categories: Desserts, Mexican
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 c  Sugar                               1 ts To 2 ts fresh orange peel,
    1/2 c  Water                                    -orange part only
      4 c  Whole milk or 1 can               1/2 c  Sugar
           -evaporated milk and enough         6 lg Eggs
           Whole milk to make 3-1/2            1 ts Vanilla
           -cups                          
 
  FLAN
  
  In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup water and bring to a
  boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  Dip a brush in ice water and use to
  wash down any sugar crystals clinging to the pan.  Let boil, undisturbed,
  until it caramelizes.  As soon as the sugar syrup turns an amber color,
  stir and take off heat.  Pour immediately into a 9x5 loaf pan or an 8 cup
  ring mold, tilting pan quickly to coat the bottom and sides with the
  caramel.  Set aside while making the custard.
  
  If using whole milk only, bring to a boil and simmer 12 to 15 minutes to
  reduce to 3-1/2 cups.  If using a mixture of evaporated and whole milk,
  simply bring to a boil.  Meanwhile, use the metal blade to process the
  sugar and orange peel until the peel is grated.  Add eggs and vanilla to
  workbowl and pulse 3-4 times to "beat" the eggs.  With the machine running,
  add 1 cup of the hot milk through the feed tube. Stop the machine and whisk
  the egg-milk mixture into the remaining milk in the pan.  Pour into the
  caramel lined pan or mold and place in a larger pan half-filled with water.
  Bake the flan for 1 hour and 15 minutes in a pre-heated 350 degree oven
  until a knife inserted off-center comes out clean and the custard is set.
  
  Let cool, then chill at least 1-1/2 hours before unmolding.  Unmold onto a
  deep serving platter allowing the caramelized sauce to run over the
  custard.  Slice to serve and include some sauce in each serving. Serves
  8-10.
  
  VARIATION:  You can add 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon (or 1/2 teaspoon ground
  canela) to the custard with the vanilla.  You can also sprinkle 1/2 cup
  thinly sliced almonds over the caramel in the mold, adding quickly before
  the syrup has hardened.  Proceed with the recipe as above.
  
  Enjoy!
  
  ~ Stephanie -
  
  P.S. I have always used the combination of Evaporated and whole milk, it
  turns out really wonderful.

 Categories: Fish/sea, Mexican
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Snapper, 3 lb                       1    Bay leaf
      1 ts Salt                              1/4 ts Oregano
      2 tb Lime juice                         12    Olive, green; halved
      2 lb Tomato                              2 tb Capers
    1/4 c  Olive oil                           2    Jalape¤os en escabeche
      1    Onion; finely sliced              1/2 ts Salt
      2    Garlic clove                        3 tb Olive oil
 
  Slice the onions finely.  Peel and slice the garlic.  Cut the jalape¤os
  into strips.  Set them all aside.
  
  Clean the fish, leaving the head and tail on.  Prick the fish on both sides
  with a coarse-tined fork, rub in the salt and lime juice, and set aside in
  the dish to season for about two hours.
  
  Skin, seed, and chop the tomatoes roughly.  Set them aside.
  
  Heat the oil and fry the onion and garlic, without browning, until they are
  soft.  Add the tomatoes, with the bay leaf, oregano, olives, capers,
  jalape¤os, and salt to the pan and cook the sauce over a brisk flame until
  it is well seasoned and some of the juice has evaporated--about ten
  minutes.  Pour the sauce over the fish.
  
  Sprinkle the olive oil over the sauce and bake the fish for about twenty
  minutes, uncovered, on one side.  Turn the fish over and continue baking it
  until it is just tender--about 30 minutes.  Baste the fish frequently with
  the sauce during the cooking time.

  (6-8 Servings)
  
  In a kettle, add the pork, garlic, salt and water.  Bring to the boil and
  simmer until meat is tender.
  
  Remove pork and shred.  Cool the broth and skim accumulated fat.
  
  Put the pork in a large, flat baking dish and add approximately a soup
  ladle of broth to keep the pork moist. Cover with aluminum foil.

  4    large limes, cut into eighths 4 medium-size avocados, diced in 1-inch
  chunks 1 large spanish onion, diced 2 packages Fritos 2 packages fried
  bacon rind 1/4 c. crushed red chile 1/4 c. oregano
  
  To keep diced avocado, save the pit and place in serving dish with the
  diced avocado.  This will prevent it from turning brown.
  
  Place all other ingredients in appropriate serving dishes.  If onion and
  lime are prepared in advance, cover with foil or plastic wrap.
  
  Serving
  
  In a large soup bowl, serve a small portion of shredded pork and hominy
  with enough broth to fill approximately half the bowl.
  
  Instruct guests that they are to add ingredients gingerly until each finds
  the taste combination that suits his/her palate.
  
  Fried bacon rinds and fritos may be crushed or added whole. Lime is
  squeezed for juice.
  
  Free-for-all.  Everyone is invited to help him/herself to experiment with
  combinations.
  
  Author's Note:  All the quantities are approximations based on experience.
  If guests are delicate eaters, you'll have leftover pozole, which is
  delicious.  If they are heavy eaters, add more meat and ingredients.

    1/4 c  Butter                            1/2 c  Dark rum
  1 1/2 ts Finely Ground Expresso          1 1/2 lb Butter (no substitutes)
           - Coffee                           27 oz Semisweet chocolate chips
 
  Cut beef into 1 inch chunks or thereabouts. Let beef soak in a bowl with
  the tomatoes and juice, lemon juice, mushrooms, black pepper, crushed
  chilis and onions over night. Brown the meat in a skillet. In large pot
  throw in the tomatoes and crushed chillis, onions, meat, paste, everything
  except the beans and peppers and slow cook for three hours. Next chop your
  green and red peppers into long slivers or if you prefer diced. Also stir
  in your beans and cook slowly for one more hour. All cooking must not have
  the lid on. With the thick "soupy" ring around the pot; stir back into the
  simmering chili.
  
  You might like the chili hotter or maybe milder, depends on your taste.
  What ever you do, don't ruin the chili by making it hotter with hot sauces,
  this has a tendency to make the chili into "superficial" body heat not a
  deep solid heat. To accompany the chili try and get your hands on some
  "Agua Dente" (fire water) 80% alcohol (national drink in Colombia). I
  guarantee you will see God!

           PORK:                               1    Whole clove
      1 lb Boneless stewing pork, cut      1 1/2    Inch cinnamon stick
           -into 1-inch cubes                  1 tb Melted lard or safflower oil
           Sea salt to taste                   1 md Plantain (about 8-oz),
           SEASONING AND FINAL COOKING:             -peeled and cut into
      5 sm Chilies anchos, cleaned of        1/4    Inch cubes
           -veins and seeds and                2    Thick pineapple slices,
           Lightly toasted                          -peeled, cored, and cut into
    1/4 lb Tomatoes, broiled                        Small triangular wedges
 
  Serves 4 to 6
  
  LENTILS:
  
  Run the lentils through your hands to make sure there are no stones or
  other foreign bodies in them.  Rinse them in two changes of water and put
  into a pan.  Add onion, salt to taste, and enough water to come about 2
  inches above the surface of the lentils.  Set over medium heat and bring to
  a fast simmer.  Continue simmering until the lentils are quite soft - about
  3 hours, depending on their age.  Keep a pan of near-boiling water on the
  side, ready to add if necessary.
  
  Put the pork pieces into a pan; add salt to taste and water to cover. Bring
  to a fast simmer and continue simmering until the pork is tender but not
  soft - about 25 minutes.  Strain, reserving the broth, and set broth and
  meat aside.
  
  Cover the dried chilies with boiling water and leave to soak for about 15
  minutes, until the chilies have softened and become fleshy. Drain and put
  into a blender with 1 cup of the reserved pork broth, the broiled tomatoes,
  garlic, oregano, clove, and cinnamon; blend until smooth, adding more broth
  only if needed to release the blades of the blender.
  
  Heat the lard in a small frying pan, add the blended ingredients, and fry
  over medium heat, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan, until
  reduced and well seasoned - about 4 minutes.  Add to the lentils and add
  the pork, remaining broth, plantain, and pineapple; simmer together for
  about 30 minutes.  Adjust salt and add water if necessary. The mixture
  should be like a thick soup.

    1/2 c  Olive oil (or chili oil,                 Sliced into strips
           For spicier taste)                       -Shredded lettuce

  Macayo Fajitas
  
  (This basic fajita recipe is from the Johnson family which owns the Macayo
  chain.) **
  
  and sliced                         Chopped fresh cilantro
  
  For marinade, in a large bowl, whisk together salt, pepper, lime, garlic
  and vegetable oil.  Put meat in marinade and set aside for at least one
  hour.
  
  Heat oven to 200 degrees; set tortillas in for 1 to 3 minutes, to warm.
  Remove and put in a covered basket.
  
  Heat a large skillet and add olive oil.  Add marinated meat and saute until
  onion becomes transluscent.
  
  Place cooked meat in a large bowl or platter and serve with tortillas,
  toppings and garnishes.
  
  For each fajaita, fill a tortilla with meat and desired amounts of
  garnishes and toppings and roll up like a burrito.
  
  Serve with refried beans, black beans or Spanish rice. Make 4 to 6
  servings.
  
  VARIATIONS: For spicier marinade, add cayenne pepper or crushed dry red
  chili pepper. Instead of lime juice, try pineapple juice, papaya juice,
  beer, wine or barbecue sauce.*
  
  *(Cooks note:) I like to use tequila, and marinate myself a bit while I'm
  doing the cooking. It makes it much easier to roll up like a burrito. It is
  the unrolling that becomes a bit difficult.

  quart pot. Add the garlic and sautee about 1 minute. Add the rice and fry
  it, stirring frequently, until the rice is golden brown. Add the liquid and
  stir. When it comes to a boil, lower to a simmer, stir once more and cover.
  Cook until all water is absorbed. This is the basic recipe, and there is a
  lot more you can do with it. For example: Substitute 1/2 cup tomato juice,
  or a pureed tomato, for part of the liquid. Substitute part of the liquid
  with black bean soup broth. Add 1/2 cup frozen peas and carrots. Add 1/2
  cup sliced mushroom and green onion. Use beef or other broth instead of
  chicken. Add 1/2 cup cooked chick peas(garbanzo). Substitute part of the
  rice with some vermicelli. The possibilities are really endless if you use
  your imagination. Just stick to the basic recipe and proportion of rice to
  liquid. From Melanie Miguel

    1/2 sm Onion                                    Corn tortillas, heated
      3 qt Water (approx.)                          Red Chile Puree:
           Salt                                8    California chiles (1/4 lb)
  1 1/2 c  Hominy                            2/3 c  Water
           Red Chile Puree (see below)    
 
  It's traditional to recover from a night on the town with a bracing bowl of
  menudo.
  
  Scrape off any fat from tripe.  Cut tripe into 1-inch squares. Place tripe
  and calf's foot in a large bowl.  Add vinegar and cold water to cover
  generously.  Let stand 3 hours.  Drain.  Rinse tripe and calf's foot
  thoroughly.  Place in a large pot.  Add garlic and onion. Pour in water to
  cover ingredients plus 1 to 1 1/2 inches, about 3 quarts. Add salt to
  taste.  Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Cover and simmer about 6 hours or
  until tripe is tender.  After 1 hour, skim foam from surface of soup. Skim
  again as needed.  Add more water if liquid evaporates. Prepare Red Chile
  Puree.  Add hominy and Red Chile Puree during last hour of cooking. Ladle
  into large bowls. Serve chopped green onions, cilantro, lemon wedges and
  hot corn tortillas separately.
  
  Makes 10 to 15 servings.
  
  Red Chile Puree: Remove stems from chiles. Break chiles open and rinse out
  seeds. Place in a saucepan with water to cover.  Bring to a boil. Continue
  to boil until chiles are softened, about 5 minutes. Drain; discard water.
  Place chiles in blender; puree.  Add enough water to make puree the
  consistency of tomato sauce. Press pureed chiles through a sieve to remove
  bits of peel.  Makes about 1 cup.
  
  Variation: Substitute 1 1/2 cups nixtamal (cooked dried corn) for canned
  hominy.  Combine with soaked tripe and calf's foot, garlic, onion and
  water. Cook as directed above.

      Title: Menudo Estilo Norteno
 Categories: Soups/stews, Mexican
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Calf's foot (1 to 1-1/2 lb)         3    Cloves garlic, peeled
      4 qt Water                           1 1/2 c  Canned hominy
      2 lb Honeycomb tripe                     6    Peppercorns
      3 lg Chiles anchos                       1 ts Oregano
      1    Large onion                         2 ts Salt, or to taste
      2    Canned, peeled green chiles    
 
  Cut the calf's foot into four pieces.  Cut the tripe into small squares.
  Put them into the pan with the onion, garlic, peppercorns, salt, and water.
  Cover and bring to a boil.  Lower the flame, open the windows(!) and simmer
  uncovered for about 2 hours, or until the tripe and foot are just tender
  but not too soft.
  
  Meanwhile, toast the chiles anchos well on a dry skillet, turning them from
  time to time until the skin is charred.  Slit them open (wearing rubber
  gloves, if you like keeping your skin) and remove the seeds and veins.
  Grind them dry to a fine powder.  Add it to the pot as the meat is cooking.
  
  Remove the pieces of the calf's foot from the pan, and when they are cool
  enough to handle, strip off the fleshy parts.  Chop them roughly and return
  them to the pan.  Add the hominy and continue cooking the menudo slowly,
  still uncovered, for another two hours.  Adjust the salt to taste.
  
  Sprinkle with oregano and serve.

           Water                              29 oz Can crushed tomatoes
      3    Jalapeno peppers, chopped       1 1/2 tb Chili powder
      1    Green or red pepper, chopped        1 ts Cumin
      1    Onion, chopped                    1/4 c  Molasses
      1 ts Garlic powder (or 2-3 minced             Salt and pepper to taste
 
  Cover the beans with water and soak overnight.  In the morning, drain the
  beans and cover with fresh water.  Bring to a boil, then simmer for about
  an hour.
  
  Place the peppers, onion, garlic powder or garlic in a saucepan and heat,
  covered, over low heat (no need for oil, the vegetable juices that are
  released will keep everything from sticking to the pan.)  Add the tomatoes
  and spices and molasses, and simmer for about ten minutes, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
  
  Drain the beans and place them in a large casserole dish.  Pour the tomato
  mixture over, and stir gently until beans and sauce are mixed.  Bake,
  uncovered, for 3 hours, until mixture is no longer soupy, and beans are
  soft.  Serves 6.
  
  Served with 1/2 cup of rice, you have a complete protein, and the dish
  racks up only 446 calories per serving and a measly 1.35 g fat.  Another
  suggestion would be to use cooked corn - it adds the same number of
  calories as the rice, and only 1 g fat to the existing 1 and a smidge.  And
  it's yummy, too.

  "Mexican meals don't usually include cake, but this one--made with bean
  puree and lots of fruit and spices--would fit right in with Mexican food!"
  Jean's Beans by Jean Hoare page 112.
  
  BEAN PUREE Start with 1 cup of dried beans or a bit more if using large
  white limas and you plan to take off the skins. Extra bean puree may be
  frozen-it looks like mashed potato. Quick Soak - Wash beans, use 3 cups of
  cold water for each cup of beans and bring slowly to a boil. Boil gently
  for 2 minutes. Remove from heat, cover and let stand for 1 hour. Drain off
  soaking water.
  
  Cover with fresh cold water, bring to a boil for 10 min, reduce heat and
  simmer about 30 min until tender.  Drain.  Remove lima bean skins and
  discard any hard beans. Grind through a foodmill, puree in a blender or
  food processor.  You may have to add a bit of liquid saved from the cooking
  process to get the mixture moving. Force the puree through a sieve about
  1/4 cup at a time if you want a very smooth puree.  Puree only keeps a day
  or two in fridge so freeze any that you are not going to use for the
  recipe.
  
  Preheat oven to 350F.  Grease and flour the bottom only of a 9x13 inch
  rectangular pan.
  
  Cream butter with sugar.  Add egg and beat well.  Blend in bean puree and
  vanilla.  In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking soda, salt, and spices.
  Mix with the apple, raisins, and nuts.  Add dry ingredients and fruit to
  creamed mixture and blend well.  Pour batter into prepared pan and bake
  35-45 min or until cake tests done when tried with a toothpick.
  
  Mix icing sugar with enough milk or fruit juice to make a thin glaze;
  drizzle over the still-warm cake.  Keep in the refrigerator.
  
  (My notes - I would make this again but leave off the glaze as it is quite
  sweet.)  Shared by Elizabeth Rodier

  Mexican Bean Sandwich
  
  Use chili powder to your personal taste.  Salad dressing should be low-fat
  mayonnaise type.  Beans should be cooked, drained, unsalted, chopped. (If
  you use canned beans see the dietary changes below.)

      Title: Mexican Omelet
 Categories: Mexican, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 x  Casera Sauce; *                     1 ds Pepper
      2 ea Eggs; Large                         1 tb Butter Or Margarine
      2 tb Half & Half                         2 tb Green Chiles; Chopped
    1/2 ts Oregano Leaves; Dried               1 x  Dairy Sour Cream
    1/4 ts Salt                           
 
  *    See Sowest 2 For the Recipe. Prepare the Casera Sauce; set aside. Mix
  the eggs, half-and-half, oregano, salt and pepper with a fork just until
  the whites and yolks are blended. Heat the margarine in an 8-inch skillet
  or omelet pan over medium-high heat. As the margarine melts, tilt the
  skillet to coat the bottom completely. When the margarine just begins to
  brown, the skillet is hot enough to use. Quickly pour the egg mixture into
  the skillet. Slide the skillet back and forth rapidly over the heat, and at
  the same time, stir quickly with a fork to spread the eggs continuously
  over the bottom of the skillet as they thicken. Let stand over the heat a
  few seconds to lightly brown the bottom of the omelet. (DO NOT overcook;
  the omelet will continue to cook after it is folded. Tilt the skillet; fun
  the fork under the edge of the omelet to loosen from the bottom of the
  skillet. Sprinkle with the cheese and chiles. Fold the portion of the
  omelet nearest you to the center. (allow for a portion of the omelet to
  slid up the side of the skillet.) Turn omelet out on a warm plate, flipping
  the fold portion of the omelet over so the far side is on the bottom. Tuck
  the sides of the omelet under if necessary. Top with the Casera Sauce and
  sour cream; sprinkle with fresh, chopped cilantro, if desired.

      Title: Mexican Tortillas
 Categories: Mexican, Breads
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    225 g  Polenta (Maize Meal)               25 g  Lard or margarine
      1 ts Salt                              300 ml Warm water
    225 g  Plain white flour              
 
  Mix the maize meal, salt and white flour in a large bowl, add the lard or
  margarine and rub in until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the water
  and mix to a dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and
  knead for a short time until smooth. Shape the dough into 4 equal balls,
  roughly the size of a tennis ball, and let them rest for about an hour
  covered with a damp tea towel. Roll each ball out thinly on the floured
  surface to a circle about 25cm (10 inch) in diameter.
  
  Heat an ungreased griddle or large frying pan and fry the maize meal
  pancakes over a fairly high heat, turning them over so they are lightly
  brown on each side.
  
  Variations.
  
  The tortilla is a multi-purpose bread and can be served as it is, a thin,
  flat cornbread to accompany food. It can also be used as a platter or scoop
  for thick meat or bean mixtures. It can be fried on one side only and
  rolled round a chilli-and-bean stuffing to become a Taco, or stuffed,
  sometimes fried and coated in sauce when it is known as an Enchillada.
  Finally, it can be sprinkled with sweet mixtures and served as a pudding.

  Oaxacan Black Mole Serves 10 to 12
  
  The Chicken:
  
  Put the chicken into a saucepan with the garlic, onions, and mint. Add
  water to cover and salt to taste.  Bring to a simmer, cover the pan, and
  continue simmering until the chicken is just tender - about 35 minutes.
  Strain, reserving the broth.
  
  Remove stems from the dried chilies, if any, slit them open, and remove
  seeds and veins, reserving the seeds.  Toast the chilies for about 50
  seconds on each side; if you're using guajillos, toast them longer, until
  they are almost charred - about 2 minutes. Rinse the chilies in cold water,
  cover with hot water, and leave to soak for about 30 minutes. Put the
  reserved chile seeds into an ungreased frying pan and toast over fairly
  high heat, shaking them around from time to time so that they brown evenly.
  Then raise the heat and char until black.  Cover with cold water and set
  aside to soak for about 5 minutes.  Strain and put into a blender jar.
  
  Add the broiled tomatoes, unpeeled, to the blender jar along with the
  water, cloves, allspice, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.
  
  Heat some of the lard in a small frying pan and fry the sesame seed until a
  deep golden color - a few seconds.  Strain, putting the fat back into the
  pan and the seeds into the blender jar, and blend as smooth as possible.
  
  Fry the rest of the ingredients, except the chilies and chocolate, one by
  one, strain, and put into the blender jar, blending after each addition and
  adding water or broth as necessary to release the blades.
  
  heat 1/4 cup of the lard in the heavy pan in which you are going to cook
  the mole, add the blended mixture, and fry over medium heat, stirring and
  scraping the bottom of the pan from time to time, for about 15 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, put a few of the chilies and about 2 cups of the water in which
  they were soaking into the blender jar and blend until smooth. When you
  have blended all the chilies, add them to the fried ingredients together
  with the chocolate and cook for 5 minutes longer. Add about 4 cups of the
  chicken broth and continue cooking for 35 minutes. (Skim the fat that forms
  on the top if you are going to make tamales or mole. It is added to color
  and flavor the masa.)  Add more broth if necessary - the mole should just
  coat the back of a wooden spoon - along with the chicken and salt to taste;
  cook for 10 minutes longer.

      Title: Mole Poblano Picante
 Categories: Poultry, Soups/stews, Mexican, Chocolate
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      8    Mulato chiles                     1/8 ts Cinnamon
      4    Ancho chiles                      1/2 ts Ground coriander seed
      4    Pasilla chiles                    1/4 ts Anise
      8 lb Turkey, in pieces                 1/2 c  Raisins
      4 tb Lard                                3    Tomatoes, seeded, chopped
      4 tb Sesame seeds                        4    Canned chipotle chiles
      1 lg Onion, chopped                      2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
      2    Cloves garlic, chopped                   Salt
      1    Tortilla, cut up                         Freshly ground pepper
      1 c  Blanched almonds                    1 ts Sugar
    1/8 ts Ground gloves                  
 
  Prepare the mulato, ancho, and pasilla chiles by washing in cold water;
  removing veins, stems, and seeds; and tearing them roughly into pieces.
  Place the pieces in a bowl and soak in hot water (about 1 cup to 6 chiles)
  for about an hour. Blend the chiles with the soaking water in a blender,
  but do not over blend. The texture should remain coarse.
  
  Place the turkey pieces in a flameproof casserole with a lid, and poach,
  covered, in salted water to barely cover for 1 hour. Drain, reserving the
  stock. Dry the turkey pieces thoroughly with paper towels. Heat the lard in
  a skillet, and brown the turkey pieces, a few at a time. Arrange the turkey
  pieces in the casserole and keep warm. Combine 2 tbs of the sesame seeds,
  the onion, garlic, tortilla, almonds, cloves, cinnamon, coriander seed,
  anise, raisins, tomatoes, prepared chiles, and chipotle chiles, and reduce,
  bit by bit, to a coarse puree in the electric blender.
  
  Heat the remaining lard in a skillet, adding, if necessary, a little more
  lard to bring it up to 3 TBS. Cook the puree, stirring constantly, for
  about 5 minutes. Add 2 cups of the turkey stock, chocolate, salt and pepper
  to taste, and the sugar, and cook, over very low heat, until the chocolate
  has melted. Pour the sauce over the turkey; cover; and cook over the lowest
  possible heat for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. The sauce should be rather
  thicker than the consistency of heavy cream. If it seems too thin, thin
  with turkey stock. Sprinkle with remaining sesame seeds just before
  serving.
  
  NOTE: Chipotle chile and its close relative morita chile have the most
  exotic flavor of any of the Mexican chiles. They are also exceedingly
  picante and can really lift your head off. If you do not care for hot food,
  experiment with the chipotle, for even in a small quantity its flavor will
  survive. Begin with a half chile, tasting and adding more to your mole with
  caution until you find the amount that suits your taste.

      6    Pasilla chiles                    1/4 ts Cinnamon
      8 lb Turkey, in pieces                 1/2 ts Anise
      1 lb Pork loin, in 2" chunks             1 lb Tomatoes, seeded, chopped
      4 tb Lard                                1 oz Unsweetened chocolate
    1/2 c  Almonds                                  Salt
    1/2 c  Peanuts                                  Freshly ground pepper
      1    Tortilla, coarsely chopped          1 ts Sugar
      4 tb Sesame seeds                   
 
  Prepare the chiles as described above in the recipe for Mole Poblano
  Picante. Place the turkey and pork in a large kettle with enough salted
  water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook, covered, for 1 hour. Drain,
  reserving the stock. Dry the turkey and pork pieces thoroughly with paper
  towels. Heat the lard in a large, heavy skillet. Brown the turkey and pork
  pieces, a few at a time; then transfer to a flameproof casserole. In the
  electric blender, blend the almonds, peanuts, tortilla, 2 tbs of the sesame
  seeds, cloves, cinnamon, anise, tomatoes, and the prepared chiles, and
  reduce to a coarse puree.
  
  Heat the lard remaining in the skillet, adding a little more if necessary,
  and cook the mixture for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Add 2 cups of the
  reserved stock, the chocolate, salt and pepper to taste, and sugar. Stir
  until chocolate has melted. Pour the sauce over the turkey and pork in the
  casserole; cover; and cook over very low heat for about 1 hour, taking care
  not to let it burn. Sauce should be the consistency of heavy cream, so, if
  necessary, thin with more stock. Sprinkle with remaining sesame seeds just
  before serving.

      1 c  Unconverted long-grain rice              Plain Boiled Rice
      2 c  Cold water                     
 
  Put the rice into a bowl, cover with very hot water, and leave to soak
  about 8 minutes.  Drain, rinse well, and set aside.  Put 2 cups water in a
  heavy pot or earthenware bean pot, bring to a boil, sprinkle in the rice,
  and return to the boil.  Cover the pan, turn the heat to the lowest
  possible point, and cook until all the water has been absorbed by the rice,
  shaking the pot from time to time so that it does not stick. Test the rice
  after about 15 minutes; if soft but not mushy, turn off the heat and leave
  the rice sitting, still covered, for a further 5 minutes. Very carefully
  loosen the rice with a fork, fluffing it up. Cover again and leave to sit
  for another 15 minutes.  Add salt if desired.

           -hot!)                              1 tb Lemon juice
 
  Put into blender and blast until its chopped up real good. This makes about
  a pound of salsa.  In fact it fits into an empty Sams Choice Salsa jar just
  fine.  She also sometimes puts green peppers into the recipe which doesn't
  make it hot either. This recipe satisfies my need for salsa, however, I
  like it hot sometimes myself.

      2 sm Heads of garlic, scored           3/4 c  Melted lard or safflower oil
           -around the middle                1/4 c  Sesame seed
      2 sm White onions, roughly sliced      1/4 c  Shelled peanuts
      6    Fresh mint sprigs                  10    Unskinned almonds
           Sea salt to taste                 1/4 c  Raisins
           The sauce:                          1 sm Onion, thickly sliced
    1/4 lb Chilhuacles negros or               1    Ripe plantain, skinned and
           -guajillos                               -cut into thick slices
      2 oz Chilies pasillas (Mexican,          2    Crisp-fried corn tortillas
           -not Oaxacan)                       3    Thick slices dried French
      2 oz Chilies mulatos                          -bread or semisweet roll
    1/2 lb (about 1 large) tomatoes,           2 oz Tablet Mexican drinking
           -broiled                                 -chocolate
      1 c  Water                                    Sea salt to taste
      3    Whole cloves                   
 
  The Chicken:
  
  Put the chicken into a saucepan with the garlic, onions, and mint. Add
  water to cover and salt to taste.  Bring to a simmer, cover the pan, and
  continue simmering until the chicken is just tender - about 35 minutes.
  Strain, reserving the broth.
  
  Remove stems from the dried chilies, if any, slit them open, and remove
  seeds and veins, reserving the seeds.  Toast the chilies for about 50
  seconds on each side; if you're using guajillos, toast them longer, until
  they are almost charred - about 2 minutes. Rinse the chilies in cold water,
  cover with hot water, and leave to soak for about 30 minutes. Put the
  reserved chile seeds into an ungreased frying pan and toast over fairly
  high heat, shaking them around from time to time so that they brown evenly.
  Then raise the heat and char until black.  Cover with cold water and set
  aside to soak for about 5 minutes.  Strain and put into a blender jar.
  
  Add the broiled tomatoes, unpeeled, to the blender jar along with the
  water, cloves, allspice, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.
  
  Heat some of the lard in a small frying pan and fry the sesame seed until a
  deep golden color - a few seconds.  Strain, putting the fat back into the
  pan and the seeds into the blender jar, and blend as smooth as possible.
  
  Fry the rest of the ingredients, except the chilies and chocolate, one by
  one, strain, and put into the blender jar, blending after each addition and
  adding water or broth as necessary to release the blades.
  
  heat 1/4 cup of the lard in the heavy pan in which you are going to cook
  the mole, add the blended mixture, and fry over medium heat, stirring and
  scraping the bottom of the pan from time to time, for about 15 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, put a few of the chilies and about 2 cups of the water in which
  they were soaking into the blender jar and blend until smooth. When you
  have blended all the chilies, add them to the fried ingredients together
  with the chocolate and cook for 5 minutes longer. Add about 4 cups of the
  chicken broth and continue cooking for 35 minutes. (Skim the fat that forms
  on the top if you are going to make tamales or mole. It is added to color
  and flavor the masa.)  Add more broth if necessary - the mole should just
  coat the back of a wooden spoon - along with the chicken and salt to taste;
  cook for 10 minutes longer.

      Title: Old-California Empanaditas
 Categories: Cheese/eggs, Mexican
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 c  Butter                              2 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
      1 pk (8 oz) Cream Cheese                 1    Egg yolk
    1/2 ts Salt                                2 ts Cream or milk
 
  Beat butter, cheese and salt together in a mixer until completely smooth
  and blended.  Work in flour to a smooth dough.  (You can use a mixer for
  this step, too, but results are superior if you work in the flour with your
  fingertips, a fork or rubber spatula).  Flatten dough in foil to form a an
  8 X 6 inch rectangle.  Chill overnight.  (You can chill it several days
  before using).  Remove from refrigerator 8 to 10 minutes before rolling.
  (Many recipes suggest a 30 minute wait before rolling dough, but it's
  easier to handle when rolled as cold as possible). Divide dough for ease in
  rolling and to insure cold dough.
  
  Keep unrolled portion in refrigerator until ready to use.  Roll on floured
  pastry cloth with floured rolling pin or between two sheets of waxed paper.
  The former is easier, in my opinion, and I find absolutely no sticking when
  I use a pastry cloth and covered pin.  I first rub cloth and pin well with
  flour, then shake out excess.  When using waxed paper, loosen it on both
  sides of pastry several times as you roll.
  
  Shape as directed in specific recipes and chill before baking.  Brush tops
  (only) of all pastries with egg yolk beaten with cream.  Bake in moderate
  oven (350 degrees) unless otherwise specified.

  Heat 1 tb oil in heavy large non-stick skillet over high heat.  Add
  potatoes and cook until golden, stirring often, about 8 minutes.  Reduce
  heat to low. Add chili powder and cumin and cook 2 minutes. Add tomatoes,
  sliced green onions and tomato sauce. Cover and cook until potatoes are
  tender, about 6 minutes. Add 1/3 c Jack cheese, egg, cilantro, and jalapeno
  and stir until cheese melts. Season with salt and cayenne.
  
  Brush large skillet with oil and place over medium heat.  Add 1 tortilla
  and cook until softened, 30 seconds per side.  Transfer to work surface.
  Top tortilla with 1/3 cup filling and roll up. Place seam side down in
  baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling, brushing skillet
  with oil as necessary. (Can be made 2 hours ahead.  Cover and chill.)
  
  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Enchilada Sauce<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
  
  Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large skillet over high heat.  Add
  chopped onions and garlic and saute 5 minutes. Mix in cumin seeds, chili
  powder, dried oregano and ground cinnamon and saute 1 minute.  Add
  enchilada sauce and tomato sauce and simmer 2 minutes. Mix in fresh lime
  juice. Season to taste with salt and cayenne pepper. (Can be prepared 2
  days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Reheat before using.)
  
  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Topping<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< <<<<<<
  
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Pour enchilada sauce over enchiladas. Sprinkle
  with feta and remaining 1 1/3 cups Jack cheese.  Cover with foil. Bake
  until heated through and bubbling, about 30 minutes. Serve with sour cream
  and green onions.
  
  Note: Although I'm sure that the _Bon Appetite_ chefs know exactly what
  they are talking about, I find that, at high temperatures, olive oil breaks
  down a great deal, begins to smoke, and sets off fire alarms all over. I
  use peanut oil and a wok to saute potatoes since, as far as skillets go, I
  don't have non-stick and heavy all in one.  Additionally, I don't use any
  extra salt in the dish, finding it amply seasoned without.

  "Puchero is to Mexican cooking what Pot-au-Feu is to French.  The
  difference lies in Puchero's imaginative combination of vegetables and
  fruits. Since it is even more delicious the second day, this recipe will
  make an ample amount to serve 8 for dinner, with some left over for lunch
  the following day."
  
  Place the chick peas in a kettle, cover with broth, and soak overnight.
  
  Cut the lamb and beef into 2-inch cubes, cut the chicken into serving
  pieces, and dice the ham.  Peel and slice the onion and garlic.  Combine
  the drained chick peas, all the meats, the veal knuckle, onion, garlic, and
  salt in a large soup kettle.  Cover with 2 quarts of cold water and bring
  to a full boil.  Skim off the froth.  Lower the heat, cover, and simmer for
  45 minutes.
  
  Cut the cabbage into eight wedges. Peel and slice the turnips and carrot.
  Slice the zucchini. Peel and dice the sweet potatoes.  Cut the corn from
  the cob.  Add the cabbage, turnips, carrot, zucchini, sweet potatoes, and
  corn to the kettle. Cover and simmer about 20 minutes or until meats and
  vegetables are tender.
  
  Peel the boiled white potatoes and cut into thick slices. Peel bananas and
  cut into 2-inch slices.  Saute potatoes, sprinkled with crushed coriander
  seeds and pepper in oil.  Remove the potato slices with a slotted spoon.
  Keep warm.  In the same oil saute the bananas until golden. Keep warm with
  the potatoes.
  
  Peel, core, and slice the pears and peaches.  Put in a small pan with a
  little water and poach for 10 minutes.  Do not overcook.  Drain the fruit.
  
  Adjust the seasonings. Serve each bowl of soup with the juice from one lime
  wedge and a Tbsp. of Guacamole.

  *     See Sowest 2 for recipe. Mix the cheese, pumpkin, 1/2 tsp salt and
  the nutmeg.  Set aside.  Mix the flour, and 1/2 tsp salt in a large bowl.
  Make a well in the center of the flour. Beat the tomato paste, oil and eggs
  until well blended and pour into the well in the flour. Stir with a fork
  gradually bring the flour mixture to the center of the bowl. Do this until
  the dough makes a ball. If the dough is too dry, mix in up to 2 tbls of
  water.  Knead lightly on a floured cloth-covered surface, adding flour if
  dough is sticky, until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Cover and let
  rest for another 5 minutes. Divide the dough into 4 equal parts. Roll the
  dough, one part at a time, into a rectangle about 12 X 10-inches. (Keep the
  rest of the dough covered.) Drop the pumpkin mixture by 2 level tsps onto
  half of the rectangle, about 1 1/2-inches apart in 2 rows of 4 mounds each.
  Moisten the edges of the dough and the dough between the rows of pumpkin
  mixture with water. Fold the other half of the dough up over the pumpkin
  mixture, pressing the dough down around the pumpkin. Trim the edges with a
  pastry wheel or knife. Cut between the rows of filling to make ravioli;
  press the edges together with a fork or cut with a pastry wheel sealing the
  edges well. Repeat with the remaining dough and pumpkin filling. Place
  ravioli on towel, let stand turning once, until dry, about 30 minutes.
  Prepare the Pumpkin Seed Sauce. Heat until hot; reserve keeping it warm.
  Cook ravioli in 4 quarts of boiling salted water (2 tsp of salt) until
  tender, about 10 to 15 minutes; drain carefully. Serve the ravioli with the
  warm Pumpkin Seed Sauce spooned over.

  Spread 1 tablespoon of the ricotta over half of each tortilla. Fold over
  and secure with a toothpick.
  
  Put oil to a depth of 1/4 inch in a large frying pan and heat. When hot but
  not smoking, add a few of the tacos and fry, turning once until they are a
  golden color and quite crisp.  Continue with the rest, adding oil if
  necessary.
  
  Drain the tacos well on paper toweling and remove as soon as they are cool
  enough to handle.  With a toothpick, ease them open and insert about 2
  tablespoons of the sauce.  Serve immediately; they cannot wait.

      Title: Roasted Habanero Salsa From Hell
 Categories: Sauces, Mexican, Salsa
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 tb Virgin olive oil                   10    Habanero chile peppers
    1/3 c  Virgin olive oil                  1/4 c  Lime juice (about 2 limes)
      6    Ripe plum tomatoes, halved        1/4 c  Chopped cilantro
           Freshly ground black pepper    
 
  Combine tablespoon of olive oil and garlic and mix well.  Rub tomato halves
  with this mixture, sprinkle with salt and freshly cracked pepper and roast
  in 500-degree oven until they begin to take o some serious color, about 15
  to 20 minutes.  Remove from oven, cool to room temperature and dice.
  
  Meanwhile, grill habanero peppers over a medium-hot fire until slightly
  colored, 2 to 3 minutes.  Temove peppers from fire and mince.  Be very
  careful when working with this pepper.  Wear gloves when mincing it, and if
  you get any of the juice on your skin, wash it off with a mild bleach
  solution, which neutralizes the capsaicin.  Also, be sure not to rub your
  eyes while working with these peppers, and wash your hands well after
  you're done.  These little guys are incendiary.
  
  In medium-size bowl, combine tomatoes, peppers, 1/4 cup olive oil, lime
  juice and cilantro, mix well, and prepare for takeoff.
  
  This salsa will keep, covered and refrigerated, about 5 to 6 weeks, mainly
  because no mold or bacteria would dare to come near the stuff. Yields 2
  cups.

 Categories: Sauces, Mexican, Salsa
      Yield: 2 servings
 
     10    Tomatillos                          2 tb Chopped Cilantro Leaves
      6 oz Green Tomato, Unripe              1/2 ts Sea Salt, To Taste

      3    Serrano Chilies, Chopped       
 
  MAKES 2 CUPS
  
  According to local lore, the cook serves this to her son-in-law because "le
  pica mucho" (it bites him a lot). It is very "picante". However, if you use
  3 chiles, it is only pleasantly picante. This sauce should have a thick,
  rough consistency and is used with frijoles, rice, or broiled meats. It is
  best eaten fresh but will keep for a few days in the refrigerator without
  spoiling. It does not freeze well.
  
  Roughly chop the tomatoes, add a little at a time with the rest of the
  ingredients to a blender jar, and blend for a few seconds with each
  addition until the sauce has a rough consistency.
  
  the key to salsa verde is the tomatillos (tomate verde -- NOT just a green
  tomato)...don't know where you're from, but if it's the west or southwest,
  you'll probably find them in the super...if not, they are available canned,
  in a mexican food section.

      Title: Salsa Fresca
 Categories: Sauces, Mexican, Spices/etc., Hot, Condiment
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Ripe Tomatoes                     1/2 c  Ice Water
    1/4 c  Chopped Scallions                        Salt
      2 md Finely Chopped Jalapenos            1 ts Crushed Oregano Leaves
      1 tb Fresh Lime Juice               
 
  Chop the tomatoes and add to the onions and jalapenos in a medium sized
  bowl.  Add the remaining ingredients and mix by hand, bruising the tomato
  pieces.  Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary.  Serve at once as this
  salsa doesn't keep well.  The difference between this salsa and Pico De
  Gallo is that this recipe calls for oregano and Pice De Gallo calls for
  cilantro.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Unskinned tomatoes, diced         1/3 c  Chopped cilantro

  This particular salsa is meant to be eaten fresh as it does not freeze well
  & looses its eye appeal by the second day.
  
  (use just enough to moisten the tomatoes and yield the desired texture)
  
  Mix together all ingredients and set aside at room temperature for about 30
  minutes before using.

  Chop the unskinned tomato and mix with the rest of the ingredients.
  
  Although this can be made up to three hours ahead, it is best made at
  almost the last minute, for it soon loses its crispness and the coriander
  it's sharp flavor.

      Title: Salsa Picante
 Categories: Sauces, Mexican, Salsa
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 c  Tomatoes, canned, with juice        1 pn Sugar
      1 sm Onion                                    Salt, to taste
      2    Chile serrano                  
 
  Now are we talking about the mild, Old El Paso-type green chiles (which are
  a mild sort of chile poblano), or are we talking about jalapenos and
  serranos?  It makes a buncha difference.  Salsa picante (which is what we
  mean when we talk about "salsa" down here) is made with one or both of the
  last two.  Acting on the presumption that it's salsa picante that you mean,
  here's a recipe.  One serrano equals two jalapenos.  If you use jalapenos,
  removing the veins from the inside will make it less hot.
  
  Place all ingredients in a blender or food processor and blend until finely
  chopped.  Pour into a saucepan and bring to a boil.  Lower heat and simmer
  30 minutes.  Cool slightly, pour into a pint jar, and refrigerate, or
  process in a boiling water bath 10 minutes (in which case reduce the
  cooking time the same amount). This sauce will keep three to four weeks in
  the refrigerator. Cooking Texas Style Candy Wagner & Sandra Marquez
