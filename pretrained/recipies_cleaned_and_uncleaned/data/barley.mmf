  "SWEETENERS
  
    The amount of sweetener called for in a recipe may be altered to suit
  your own taste. if you like less sweetener, add less. A recipe can be made
  sweetener by reducing the amount of flour by about 1/4-1/2 cup and adding
  the same amount of granulated or powdered sweetener. Maple syrup or other
  sweetener may be substituted for honey in most recipes from other books.
    Fruit concentrates may be used in place of honey or maple syrup, in about
  equal proportions.
    Regular fruit juice may be used as a sole sweetening agent in some
  recipes, with small variations in flavour. For example, if a recipe calls
  for 2 cups maple syrup and 1 1/2 cups nut milk, use 3 1/2 cups of a thick
  variety of peach or pear juice (other fruit juices are not sweet or as
  light coloured.) There will be a slight change in flavour. If a recipe
  using only fruit juice is not sweet enough, substitute 1/2 cup or so of one
  of the recipe's dry ingredients (like flour) with the same amount of
  natural powdered or granulated sweetener.
    When a recipe calls for a liquid sweetener, it is best to use maple
  syrup, fruit concentrate or natural liquid sweetener for the best flavour.
  if any other liquid sweeteners are used, the amount of sweetening must be
  increased. Some sweeteners, like molasses or sorghum, can greatly change
  the flavour of the recipe and must be experimented with."

      Title: THANKSGIVING DAY TOFU
 Categories: Vegetarian, Holiday
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Tofu
      2 tb Arrowroot
      3 tb Vogue Vegy Base
    3/4 ts Sea salt
    1/4 ts White pepper
  1 1/2 ts Agar flakes; -=OR=-
      1 ts -Agar powder
      2 tb Barley malt syrup
      2 tb Water

-------------------------------SAGE DRESSING-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Finely diced onions
    1/2 c  Finely diced celery
    1/2 c  Finely diced carrots
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
      2 tb Unrefined corn oil
    1/2 ts Ground sage
    1/4 ts Dried basil
      3 tb Vogue Vegy Base
      1 ts Sea salt
    1/8 ts Black pepper
      1 c  Water
      2 c  Cubed dry whole wheat bread
 
  This is a superb substitute for the traditional Thanksgiving turkey.  It's
  also good for other times of the year!  It's really the dressing that
  carries this dish.  The corn oil gives it that wonderful buttery taste that
  poultry dressing usually has.
  
  Wash the tofu, pat it dry, and cut it into small pieces.  Put the tofu,
  arrowroot, soup base, salt, pepper, and agar flakes in a food processor and
  blend to a smooth paste.  Oil and flour the loaf pan (or line it with
  baking liner paper after oiling).  Spread a layer of tofu paste inside the
  pan, lining the bottom and all four sides.  (Spread only a thin layer on
  the ends.)  Use all but about 1 cup of the paste.
  
  Firmly but gently press the dressing into the pan, on top of the tofu paste
  "liner".  Try to avoid displacing the tofu.  Cover the dressing with the
  remaining tofu, carefully sealing the edges.  Cover the pan with foil,
  making certain the foil doesn't come in contact with the tofu.  (The tofu
  will eat into the foil.)
  
  Bake in a preheated oven at 350 F for 30 to 40 minutes.  Then remove the
  foil cover, glaze the top of the loaf with the dissolved barley malt syrup,
  turn the oven up to 450 F, and continue baking for 10 minutes. Remove from
  oven and allow the loaf to cool for about 10 minutes.  Unmold, slice, and
  serve hot with a sauce of your choice.
  
  SAGE DRESSING:  Saute onions, celery, carrots, and garlic in oil for 5
  minutes.  Add the sage, basil, soup base, salt and pepper, and continue
  cooking 5 minutes longer.
  
  Add the water and bring to a simmer.  Stir in the bread crumbs and cook for
  a few minutes.  Then remove from heat.

      Title: MIXED GRAIN MUSHROOM CASSEROLE
 Categories: Side dish, Main dish, Casseroles, Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 servings
 
    1/2 c  Wild rice
    1/2 c  Pearl barley
    1/2 c  Brown rice
    1/4 c  Oil
      1 lg Onion; thinly sliced
      4    Garlic cloves; chopped
      4 tb Unsalted butter or margarine
           -OR- Oil
    1/2 lb Mushrooms; thickly sliced
  3 1/2 c  Broth
      1 ts Crushed dried thyme
    1/2 ts Crushed dried oregano
           Salt & pepper; to taste
 
  Combine grains in a mixing bowl and set aside. Pour the oil into a 2-3 qt.
  casserole which is safe for both stovetop and oven cooking, and place on
  med. heat. When hot , saute onion and garlic until tender and translucent,
  about 5-6 mins. Add the mixed grains and saute for 1 min., stirring
  constantly.
  
  Meanwhile melt butter or margarine (if using) in a separate pan on med.
  high heat. When hot , add mushrooms and saute quickly, stirring frequently,
  until the shrooms are hot and have just absorbed the "butter" (about 1
  min.). Immediately remove from heat.
  
  Add the broth, herbs, and mushrooms to the casserole with the onions and
  grains, and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper to taste, cover
  tightly (use aluminum foil between pot and cover if necessary for a good
  seal), and bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hr.
  
  NOTES: I use alot less oil (only as much as needed to keep things from
  sticking in my cast-iron dutch oven), add hot peppers and fresh herbs
  (rosemary is especially delicious; i dislike dried oregano so i use less or
  none), add soy sauce instead of salt, and saute the mushrooms first in the
  same pan (taking them out when done) so i dont have to wash two pans
  :^>. Frankly i can't see where they get 8 servings from, this lasts me
  maybe 3 meals....It's really a hearty dish, so save it for a cold day (some
  of us still have a few left, despite the advent of spring). Enjoy!
  
  (8 servings as a side dish, less as an entree)

      1 ts Fennel seeds
      1 ts Cumin seeds
      1 ts Caraway seeds
    1/4 c  Cracked wheat
  2 1/4 tb Margarine or butter
  2 1/4 tb Molasses or barley malt
      1 tb Grated fresh orange peel
           (zest)
    1/4 ts Baking soda
  1 1/2 c  Whole wheat or rye flour
           (your choice will affect
           The taste - I prefer wheat)
  1 1/2 c  High gluten bread flour
      2 ts Dry yeast
      2 ts Gluten (IMPORTANT!)
      3 tb Buttermilk powder
 
  THIS STEP IS VERY IMPORTANT!
  
  Combine the first 7 ingredients (using FRESH seeds only!) in 1 1/3 cup of
  boiling water and soak for 1 hour minimum.  (This pre-soaks the cracked
  wheat and pre-releases the other flavors.)
  
  Dump this concoction into a bowl and add the remaining 6 ingredients.
  
  Set your bread machine to White and bake at the medium setting...
  
  Manual -- do the normal knead and rise tricks.  Bake at 350 F for 30 - 35
  minutes.  (test this since oven temps. vary)
  
  Makes 1 loaf

  1 1/4 c  Milk
    1/2 tb Yeast
  2 1/2 c  Bread flour
      1 c  Rye flour
    1/2 tb Salt
    3/4 ts Cardamom, ground
    1/4 c  Oil
      1 tb Barley malt syrup
    1/3 c  Honey
      3    Eggs
 
  Scald milk and let cool to room temperature.
  
  Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in order.
  Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock.  Select "white bread" and push Start.
  
  In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.
  
  Since the flavor of this loaf is not too assertive, but the texture is
  substantial, it is a good sandwich bread for spicy meats, such as salami or
  pate, and ripe cheese.  For early in the day eating, toast and spread with
  orange marmalade or apple butter.

  1 1/2 ts Yeast
      2 c  Bread flour
  1 1/2 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Water
      1 tb Barley malt syrup

      2 tb Poppy seeds, sesame seeds,
           -kosher salt, minced onion
 
  From "The Best Bread Machine Cookbook Ever", by Madge Rosenberg 1. Add all
  ingredients for the dough except the barley malt syrup in the order
  suggested by your bread machine manual and process on the dough cycle
  according to the manufacturer's directions.
  
  2.  at the end of the dough cycle, remove the dough from the machine.
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  In a large pot bring 2 quarts of water to
  a boil.
  
  3.  While the water comes to a boil, divide the dough into 8 pieces. Roll
  each piece into a roll 12 inches long.  Make a circle of each piece,
  overlapping the ends by at least an inch and pressing or rolling the
  overlap tightly to seal.  Let the bagels rise for only 5 minutes.
  
  4.  Add the malt syrup to the boiling water. (The syrup gives the bagels
  their golden color.)  Lower a few bagels at a time into the boiling water.
  As soon as the bagels rise to the top, remove with a skimmer or spatula to
  a lightly greased baking sheet.  Sprinkle about 3/4 tsp. of any of the
  toppings over each bagel and bake 20 minutes, or until golden.

      Title: HEBRIDEAN SCOTCH BROTH
 Categories: Soups/stews
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Neck of mutton *
      3 pt Water
      1 ts Salt
      3 oz Barley
      1 oz Onion
      1    Piece Swedish turnip (5 oz)
      1 lg Carrot
      1 sl White cabbage (1/2")
      1 lg Leek
           Black pepper
           Parsley; to finish
 
  *Note: Neck of mutton may be either whole or in chops (use lamb only if you
  have to).
  
  Start to cook this dish the day before serving.  Boil the neck of mutton in
  a large covered pan in 2-1/2 pints lightly salted water for 2 hours (or
  more if the meat needs it).  Skim off all the scum and the excess fat as it
  rises to the surface of the water.
  
  Take out the meet when it is tender.  Put in the barley and leave it
  soaking in the stock overnight.  Next day, bring the stock and barley back
  to the boil.  Prepare and dice all the vegetables except the leeks to the
  stock and cook for another 60 minutes.  Add the leeks, cut into fine rings,
  10 minutes before the end of cooking.
  
  If you want to have the meat in the stew, strip it off the bones, cut into
  small pieces and return it to the soup before reheating thoroughly.
  
  Put a tablespoon of parsley in each plate, and pour in the soup.  If you
  prefer a two-dish meal, serve the meat as a main course afterwards with
  potatoes - Golden Wonder are Chrissie's preferred variety.  Bake the
  potatoes if they are mature.  Or boil them in their jackets if they are
  new.  For really fluffy, floury boiled potatoes, Chrissie cooks hers whole
  and unpeeled (never cut a Golden Wonder) for 12-15 minutes, depending on
  average size.  Then drain out all but a little of the water, lid the pan
  tightly and steam the potatoes for another 10 or 15 minutes, shaking
  regularly, until they are dry and floury in texture.

      Title: BARLEY BROTH WITH CHICKEN
 Categories: Soups/stews, Poultry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 oz Pot barley
  2 1/2 pt Good quality chicken stock
      1    Lemon
      1    Fat garlic clove
      2    Leeks
    1/4 lb Mushrooms
      2    Chicken livers, if available
           Cold cooked chicken meat *
      5 tb Coarsley chopped parsley
      1 sm Knob butter
 
  *Note: The recipe calls for 1-2 chicken livers, if available, and "shreds
  of cold cooked chicken meat, if available".
  
  Grate the zest of the lemon very finely and reserve it.  Put the barley
  into a soup pan, add 1 tablespoon lemon juice and cold chicken stock. Bring
  to the boil, cover and simmer for about 40 minutes until the barley is
  tender with just a hint of bite to the centre of the grain.  Add the
  chicken meat, if used, to the pan towards the end of this time to heat it
  through gently but thoroughly.
  
  When the barley is nearly ready, slice the mushrooms thickly, and slice the
  leeks (tender green parts as well as the white) very thinly indeed so that
  the leaves fall into ribbony shreds.  Cut the chicken livers, if available,
  into 2 to 3 pieces and saute them briefly in the butter until crusty on the
  outside but still pink within.  Fry the mushrooms in the fat remaining in
  the pan then reduce the heat and cook the leeks gently for 2 to 3 minutes,
  just shaking occasionally.  Then add contents of the frying pan to the soup
  pan.  Add the mushrooms and check seasoning.
  
  Put the chicken livers into a warmed soup tureen and crush with a fork to
  make a coarse paste.  Add the finely chopped garlic, the lemon zest and
  most of the parsley.  Pour on the piping hot soup, stir to mix well,
  sprinkle the rest of the parsley on top and serve.
  
  Note: If the soup is not served straight away, but allowed to get cold, the
  barley will go on swelling and softening; when reaheated the dish then
  seems more like a stew than a soup.  I like it this way but you may prefer
  to lift out the grain and cool it down separately from the rest of the
  soup.

      Title: COCKTAIL CRUNCH
 Categories: Appetizers, Indian
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3 oz Rye flakes
      3 oz Jumbo oat flakes
      3 oz Barley flakes
      3 oz Wheat flakes
      3 oz Peanut kernals
           -- not salted or dry-roast
      2 oz Flaked almonds
      2 oz Sunflower seeds
      1 ts (heaped) coriander seeds
      1 ts (heaped) cumin seeds
      1 tb Garam marsala
      1 ts Tumeric
      3 tb Sesame oil
      3 tb Peanut oil
      1 tb Soy sauce
      5 tb Water
 
  Crush the coriander and cumin - lightly.  Mix them with the nuts and seeds
  on two baking trays.  Set the oven to 375 F (190 C) gas mark 5 and put the
  baking trays into the oven while it heats up.  Meanwhile measure the flaked
  grains and mix them together in a large bowl.  Put into a cup the garam
  marsala, tumeric, a good grinding of black pepper, a scrunch of sea salt,
  the soy, both sorts of oil and the water.
  
  When the oven has reached the required temperature, stir the nut and seed
  mixture with the flaked grains.  Beat the spicy oil-and-water mixture with
  a fork to emulsify it, pour it on to the dry ingredients and stir for 2
  minutes.  Spread the mixture out on to the baking trays and bake for 40
  minutes until golden.  Swap the positions of the trays in the oven at least
  once during this time and stir the mixture occasionally to encourage even
  cooking.  Let the mixture become cold and crunchy before storing in an
  airtight jar.  It keeps well for about a month.  Makes enough to fill one
  jar.

     10    Lg shrimp; peeled cut 4 piec
    1/4 c  Grated pecorino cheese
 
  In a large saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat. Add
  shallot and cook, stirring, until translucent. Add barley; stir to coat
  with the oil. Reduce heat to medium. Continue cooking barley, stirring
  occasionally, for 2-3 minutes; take care not to let it brown. While barley
  is cooking, bring vegetable stock to a boil. Add vegetable stock to barley,
  a cup at time. Cook, stirring frequently, until liquid is almost absorbed
  before adding more liquid. Keep adding liquid, stirring frequently until
  barley pearls are al dente, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cut eggplant into
  1/2-inch cubes. Heat 4 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over
  medium-high heat. Saute eggplant, stirring frequently, until soft, about 12
  minutes. Set aside. Using skillet in which eggplant was cooked, add
  remaining tablespoon of oil. Saute shrimp until pink. When barley is done,
  stir in eggplant and shrimp. Add grated pecorino cheese. Serve. Source:
  Odette Fada, Rex Il Restaurante, Los Angeles Fada's barley risotto is easy
  to make. It's a great way to offer the luxury of shellfish. Because the
  shrimp is cut into pieces, you only a half-pound of it to make risotto for
  6-8 people. Despite the shrimp, this dish is predominantly grain. It's high
  in complex carbohydrates and fiber, and low in fat. But it's so exciting
  that one hesitates to label it with the stigma of "healthy eating." Best of
  all, here's a dish that fits the proverbial champagne taste on a beer
  budget; in total, ingredients for this risotto cost about $10. Add a salad
  and a cheese course and you can feed a small dinner party for about $5 a
  head.

      Title: BARLEY MUFFINS
 Categories: Bread
      Yield: 12 big muffin
 
  2 1/2 c  Barley flour
      2 t  Baking powder
        ds Salt
      2    Eggs
    1/4 c  Rich cream
    1/4 c  Honey
 
  Sift together the barley flour, baking powder, and salt.  Beat eggs
  slightly.  Combine eggs, cream, and honey with dry ingredients and mix
  well.  Pour batter into muffin tin and bake at 400 F for 25 minutes
  The same book says barley flour can be substituted for white flour and
  make an all-barley bread.  So it seems one could substitute oats for
  some of the barley in this recipe to make Barley/oats muffins.

  This is a recipe for a Czech barley casserole that is traditionally
  served on Christmas Eve but is also good as a side dish. Cook the
  onion in the butter until translucent. Wash the mushrooms until free
  from grit.
   Add the barley (or barley grits, mushrooms, salt and water to the
  onions and cook, uncovered, until the water has evaporated, stirring
  frequently. (Mixture will be very thick.) Add the remaining
  ingredients.
   Place in a greased casserole or baking dish and bake at 350 degrees
  for 30 to 35 minutes. I usually cut this recipe in half unless we are
  having a really big crowd. It also freezes well.

           Salt and pepper; to taste

  Add your favorite spice to this casserole, if you

  delicious subtle flavor of mushrooms. In a medium
  saucepan over medium heat cook onions & mushrooms till
  tender about 10 min adding small amounts of water if
  necessary to prevent drying. Add broth mix, water and
  salt & pepper and bring to a boil. Stir in barley,
  reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 50min until
  barley is tender and liquid is absorbed. Stir
  occassionally while cooking and add more water if

  This recipe is called garlic soup because it has so
  much garlic in it but it is actually a very hearty
  soup with a very sweet garlic flavor. It is well worth
  the time it takes to peel the garlic but you must use
  fresh garlic do not replace with dried minced. Place 2
  cups of the water in a large stock pot. Add the whole
  garlic cloves and cook over medium heat for 15 min.
  Remove the garlic cloves and mash them thoroughly
  before processing. Blend in a food processor. Add the
  remaining 2 1/2 qts water the barley and the wild
  rice.  Bring to a boil cover and simmer for 15 min.
  Add the remaining ingredients bring to a boil turn
  down to simmer and cook until tender about 30-45 min.
  This soup tastes best if made a day or two in advance
  to give the flavors a chance to blend. Nutrition (per

      Title: ITALIAN BARLEY (VEGAN)
 Categories: Grains, Low-fat, Prodigy, Dec.
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 c  Chopped onions
    1/2 c  Chopped sweet green peppers
      1    Garlic clove; minced
      1 cn Tomatoes; undrained/in chunk
           16 oz. can
    1/2 ts Dried oregano
    1/2 ts Dried basil
      2 c  Water
  5 1/4 oz Barley; 3/4 cup
 
  A tasty side dish for almost any entree, this filling
  grain also reheats nicely in the microwave. In a
  medium saucepan over medium heat cook onions, green
  pepper, and garlic until lightly browned. Add small
  amounts of water if necessary to prevent drying. Add
  tomatoes spices and water. Bring to a boil. Stir in
  barley, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer 50
  minutes until barley is tender and water is absorbed.
  Stir occasionally while cooking and add more water if
  necessary. Note: the original recipe called to saute
  the 1st three ingredients in olive oil(1T+1t) but I
  chose to eliminate it and eliminate almost 5 gms fat
  per serving.

      Title: WHOLE-GRAIN BREAKFAST CEREAL
 Categories: Breakfast, Digest
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Whole wheat berries
      1 c  Whole rye berries
      1 c  Whole triticale
      1 c  Whole barley
      1 c  Brown rice
      1 c  Buckwheat groats
      1 c  Millet
      1 c  Sesame seeds
      1 c  Flaxseed
      1 c  Lentils
     10 c  Oat groats
 
  I mix it up, then cook a pot of it by measuring 2 cups of cereal to 5 cups
  of water, bringing it to boil, & then letting it sit over night. Then I
  have a bowlful each morning, heated in the microwave until the cooked
  cereal is gone and I need to make more. Or you could do the same with a
  smaller amount, for one serving, say, try 1/4 cup of cereal. It's very
  chewy and satisfying. And of course lots of whole grains. Sometimes I just
  use oatmeal instead of oat groats, since they are difficult to find and I
  like the consistency that oatmeal adds. In the book he has a little
  paragraph about each grain, explaining what vitamins/minerals it has & what
  it's good for.

 Categories: Digest, July, Slow cooker
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Onion, chopped
      1    Carrot, chopped (I used 2, I
           Like them)
      1 c  Navy beans, soaked
    1/2 t  Prepared mustard
    1/2 c  Split peas, dried
    1/4 c  Pearl barley
    1/2 c  Mushrooms, chopped
      1 c  Pinto beans, uncooked
      4 c  Vegetable broth
      3 T  Parsley, minced
    1/4 c  Lentils, dried
 
  Soak white and pinto beans overnight. Saute onion, mushrooms and carrot in
  1 T of vegetable broth until tender. Add drained beans, vegetable bouillon,
  mustard and parsely, bring to bil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer 45
  minutes. Add split peas, lentils and barley. Cover and simmer another hour
  until all beans are tender. (Note: I like it spicy so I added lots of
  tabasco and pepper). I know this is more of a "winter recipe" but I think
  it will be good cold, also. Things got a bit mushy in the crockpot so it
  might be better to cook on the stove.

      Title: SEITAN PEPPER STEAK  <T>
 Categories: Digest, July
      Yield: 6 servings
 
------------------------RON PICKARSKI'S _FRIENDLY_FO------------------------
  1 3/8 oz (1 package) dried, sliced
           Shiitake mushrooms (or 1 to
  1 1/2 c  Reg.)
      2 c  Water*
      3 T  Tamari*
      2 c  Flaked <angle-cut> seitan
      1 c  Diced onions
    1/2 c  Diced red bell peppers
      2 T  Sesame oil (To saute. Use
           Apropriate replacement)
      2 T  Minced garlic
      2 T  Chopped basil
    1/2 c  Diced green bell peppers
    1/4 c  Sherry
      2 c  Water
      3 T  Barley miso or other dark
           Miso
      2 T  Tomato paste <optional>
           (tomato is never just
           'optional' MC)
      1 T  Tamari <optional>
    1/4 c  Arrowroot, disolved in 1/4
        c  Water.
 
  If you are using the shiite mushrooms, place them in a bowl and cover them
  with hot water. Soak until soft (about 30 minutes). Then place the soaked
  mushrooms in a pot with 2 cups of water (use the soaking liquid) and 3
  tablespoons tamari. Simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes, and set aside.
  
  Saute' the seitan, mushrooms, onions, and red bell peppers in the oil (I
  guess that would be water here...MC) along with the garlic and basil. When
  the vegetables are tender (half cooked), add the green bell peppers,
  sherry, and 1.75 cups water.
  
  Mix the miso and 1/4 cup water, along with the tomato paste and the
  tablespoon of tamari, if you wish. Add to the saute'ed vegetables. Add the
  dissolved arrowroot and continue to simmer, while sirring constantly, until
  the sauce has thickened. Serve the seitan pepper steak with noodles, rice,
  or mashed potatoes.

      Title: MUSHROOM BARLEY STEW
 Categories: Digest, August
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Cooked barley
      1 c  Cooked garbanzo beans
    1/2    Green pepper, chopped
    1/2    Red pepper, chopped
      1    Carrot, cut into bite-sized
           Pieces
    1/2    Onion, sliced
        x  Chopped mushrooms (use your
           Favorite amount or none at
           All)
      2 lg Cloves garlic, crushed
      1 cn Vegetable stock (I used Hain
           Fat-free veggie broth) Or 2
        c  Stock you've made yourself
        x  Cumin
        x  Tabasco sauce
        x  Black pepper
        x  Tamari
        x  Salt (just a bit)
           Lemon juice
 
  Toss the carrots into a hot wok and cook for a few minutes, add the garlic,
  onions and green peppers, deglazig the pan with water or tamari. Add the
  mushrooms and cook just until the mushrooms start giving up their liquid.
  Add the garbanzo beans, barley, and vegetable stock.
  
  Add spices to taste.  The tamari really worked well in this, but I only
  used a tablespoon for the whole recipe.  The black pepper and tabasco gave
  it some "kick" and I threw in the cumin because I like the flavor. Add
  these in small amounts if you don't like things really hot. I ended up
  having something that was too hot because I accidentally threw in too much
  tabasco (I used the lemon juice to counter it, and it was fine). The salt
  is optional.  I put in just a touch.
  
  You can add more water and/or water/tamari mix if you want to make it a
  little soupier.
  
  Cook it until it's really hot and serve over toasted whole wheat bread,
  like a sloppy joe.  Even though it's been warm during the day here in the
  Northeast, we've still had some cool evenings, so hot food has been okay.
  This is good served with fruit salad or tossed salad.

      Title: CONSUMER REPORTS VEGETARIAN BURGER
 Categories: Vegetables, August
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 c  Cooked; drained barley
      1 c  Cooked chickpeas; slightly
    1/2 c  Quick-cooking oatmeal -- raw
    1/8 t  Salt
      1 t  Paprika
      2 T  Soy sauce
    1/4 t  Ground blackpepper
        x  Other spices to taste
      1    Small Stalk celery
      1    Small Onion
      1    Scallion
      1    Clove garlic
           Chili powder opt'l
           Curry powder opt'l
 
  Combine the barley, chickpeas, oatmeal, salt, paprika, soy sauce, black
  pepper and other spices in a large bowl. In a blender, finely chop: celery,
  onion, scallion and garlic. Add the chopped vegetables to the ingredients i
  the bowl and mix thoroughly.  Shape into patties, "sausages" or "meatballs"
  Melt a little butter or margarine in a frying pan and cook over medium heat
  for three to five minutes on each side, or until lightly browned.  Makes si
  burgers. Other grains, such as rice or cracked wheat, can be substituted
  for the barley; soybeans, navy, pinto, or other beans can be substituted
  for the chick-peas. Nuts and seeds can also be added. Each CU burger
  contained 114 calories, wi 5 grams of protein, 1 gram of fat, 22 grams of
  carbohydrate, and 1.9 milligrams of iron. It lacked vitamin B-12 and was
  high in sodium (500 milligrams). If you're watching your sodium intake,
  omit the soy sauce and try chili or curry powder.

      Title: CHUCK'S BARLEY-MUSHROOM WINTER BORSCHT (VEGAN OR LACTO)
 Categories: Vegetables, Sept.
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Barley
    1/2 c  Mixed baby lima beans, split
           Peas, brown lentils
      1 T  Olive oil
      6 c  Water
      2 T  Miso
      1 lg Onion, chopped
      5    To 6 turnips, peeled and
           Cubed (or 2 parsnips, or 2
           Potatoes)
      2    Carrots, sliced about 1/2"
           Thick
    1/2    To 3/4 pound mushrooms,
           Sliced
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/2 t  Pepper (or to taste)
      2 t  Marjoram
      1 t  Rosemary
    1/3 c  Tamari
      3 T  Unsalted butter (or magarine
           For vegan)
 
  Saute the garlic and onion in olive oil on medium heat until the onions are
  translucent. Combine the barley, lima beans, split peas, lentils, miso, and
  water with the onion/garlic, and bring to a boil. Add the turnips and
  carrots, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for about 1 1/2 hours,
  stirring occasionally.
  
  ("But grandma, where did they get miso in the Ukraine?" "Shut up and eat
  your soup.")
  
  (If you have broccoli stems, peel and slice them and add them at this
  point.  I also snagged about 1 cup of shredded/sliced cabbage from the main
  dish, and added about 1/2 hour before the soup was done).
  
  Add the mushrooms, spices and tamari and continue cooking on a low heat for
  another hour.  Add the butter or margarine, let sit for a few minutes, and
  serve.  If cooking the night before, you might want to add 1 cup of water
  and heat again just before serving; the barley tends to absorb water, and
  if you omit this extra water you end up with a tasty gruel.
  
  The butter can be omitted, but it makes for a heartier soup.

 Categories: Irish, Main dish, Meats, Mom's best
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 lb Middle neck of lamb, cut in
           One inch chunks
      4 lb Potatoes, peeled
     10 sm Onions, sliced
      2 oz Pearl barley
      2 pt Beef stock
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  "That's the basic recipe. You can add a load of sliced carrots and
  leeks to make it go further and about 5-6 tsps. of Worchestershire
  sauce or regular brown sauce wot you Yanks pour over everything!! If
  you like, you could add a half a pint of Guinness to your stock. I
  make my stock from the potato peelings, carrot tops, leek ends, and
  any other stuff I find lurking in the refrigerator. If you chuck in a
  few moldy lamb bones and boil/simmer for several hours, you should
  get a damned good stock (strain the liquid or you'll get God knows
  what stuck in your teeth!!) You'll need to start with about 5 pints
  of liquid. Then bung everything into a ginormous pan, bring to the
  boil, and then simmer for about two hours...should taste bloody
  orgasmic! Salt and pepper to taste, depending on your level of
  drunkeness!!"

  2 1/2 ts Active dry yeast ; (1 1/2 ts
  2 1/2 c  Bread flour ; (1 2/3 c)
    1/3 c  Soy flour ; (1/4 c), hfs
      1 c  Triticale flour ; ((2/3 c),

      1 ts Salt ; (3/4 tsp)
    3/4 ts Fennel seed ; (1/2 tsp)
  1 1/2 ts Barley malt syrup ; (1 tsp),
    3/4 tb Wonderslim ; (1 t), *
  1 1/4 c  Water ; (3/4 c + 2 t)
 
  Recipe by: The Best Bread Machine Cookbook Ever,  Madge Rosenberg
  * The original recipe called for 1 1/2 T vegetable oil for the lg loaf and
  1 T vegetable oil for the sm loaf.
  
  Note:  The measurements in the (...) are for the small 1 lb loaf
  
  Triticale is a nutritious grain that is a hybrid of wheat and rye.  You
  can find it in most health food stores.  It adds to the taste but not much
  to the rising of bread.  In combination with wheat flour, it makes good
  bread for sandwiches or toast, with a pleasant but unobtrusive flavor.
  
  Add all ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine manual
  and process on the basic bread cycle according to the manufacturer's
  directions.

      Title: MICROWAVE GRAINS
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/3 ea Brown rice
    1/3 ea Barley
    1/3 ea Millet
 
  I was bored with rice, so I mixed 1/3 brown rice, 1/3 barley, and 1/3
  millet.  Rinsed well, then put it in the microwave for ten minutes on high,
  and let it stand for a few hours.  (I just put it in a big plastic bowl,
  and I didn't measure the water.)  It was yummy underneath chili, beans, and
  spaghetti sauce.  (3 different meals.)

      Title: Swedish Flatbread (bakestone Recipes)
 Categories: Breads, Breakfast
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      8 oz Ground wholemeal flour
      8 oz Rye or barley flour
      1 t  Salt
      8 fl Lukewarm water*
 
  *You may need as much as 12 fl total.  -- Blend the flours together with
  the salt.  Mix in sufficient water to bind together into a dough -- the
  quantity will depend on the types of flour used. -- Beat until dough
  leaves the sides of the bowl, then turn onto a floured board and knead
  thoroughly.  Heat the bakestone over a moderate heat and grease it.
  Divide the dough into four and roll one quarter out into a round as thin
  as possible.  Using a plate about 8 inches wide, trim the edges into a
  neat circle.  Prick all over to prevent the dough bubbling while cooking.
  ~- Transfer to the bakestone and cook over a moderate heat for about 15
  minutes, or until slightly colored.  Then turn and cook the other side.
  Repeat with the rest of the dough, working up the trimmings for re-shaping
  and baking.  -- Cool on a wire tray.  When cold, store in an airtight
  container.  (Danish-butter-cookie containers, the big ones, are good for
  this.)

      Title: Overnight Whole Grain Cereal
 Categories: Digest, Mar95
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Part mixed whole grains
           (e g. wheat berries, oats,
           Buckwheat, hulled barley,
           Rye, millet, etc.)
      3    Parts water
    1/3    Part raisins (optional)
 
  Boil water Add grains [and raisins, if using them] Stir Bring to boil again
  Turn off heat Cover pot Leave overnight as is [or in a warm oven]
  
  (NOTE: I usually add raisins to already cooked cereal because I like the
  texture. They turn out differently if they are added in the cooking stage.
  They plump up and are really soft, which is nice sometimes. I guess other
  types of dried fruit might work too.)
  
  You can reheat this in the morning or eat it at room temp. Suggested
  toppings included any of the following:
  
  milk-type stuff molasses fruit sesame salt maple syrup
  
  One variation the cookbook suggests is toasting and then grinding the
  grains in a hand grinder before cooking. Apparently, this makes the grains
  more nutty tasting.

      Title: SHABBOS-CHOULNT
 Categories: Soups, Jewish, Usenet
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Meat
      1 lb Meat bones
      1 lb Potatoes
    1/2 c  Barley
    3/4 c  Red beans
    3/4 c  Lima beans
      5 sm Onions
    1/4 lb Carrots
      4 c  Water (or more)

           Seasoning, to taste
 
  Put everything in a big pot, season to taste and let it cook over a low
  fire over night. It should cook 18 to 24 hours.
  
  The water should not boil dry, nor should a high fire be used, or it will
  burn.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  European Jewish traditional sabbath stew -- This is a food that
  religious Jewish people eat on Saturday afternoon. Religious people do not
  cook on Saturday, so this food must be put on the stove on Friday, before
  sunset. It then cooks overnight, filling the house with a delicious aroma,
  until after services Saturday afternoon. Shabbos means "Saturday" in
  Hebrew, and choulnt means "a mishmosh" in Yiddish. (choulnt in fact comes
  originally from the French chaud lent which means "warm slowly") The amount
  of each ingredient depends on what taste one likes, how much is available,

      Title: DOUBLE STOUT
 Categories: Drinks, Usenet

      3 ga Water
  2 1/2 oz Bullion hops
     10 lb Dark malt extract
      1 lb Black patent malt
      2 lb Crystal malt
    1/2 lb Barley, flaked
    1/4 lb Barley, roasted
      1 t  Ascorbic acid
    1/2    Licorice stick
           -(see note below)
    1/2 t  Citric acid
      1 t  Irish moss
  1 1/2 oz Golding hops
      2 t  Yeast nutrient
    3/4 oz Ale yeast
           -(3 standard packages)
 
  Combine water and Bullion hops.  Boil for 20 minutes.
  
  Add dark malt extract.  Boil for 20 minutes.
  
  Add black patent malt through Irish moss.  Boil for 5 minutes.
  
  Remove from heat and add Golding hops.  Steep for 5 minutes.
  
  Cool and add yeast nutrient and ale yeast.  When fermentation has stopped,
  add priming sugar and bottle.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Double stout beer -- I would not recommend making this as your first
  beer, but if you are into brewing and like a strong stout, then give this
  one a try. Don't be in a hurry to drink it, though, it really benefits from
  a long aging. I got the original recipe from Peter Lester in
  rec.food.drink, and formatted it for my local brewfriends. Then I thought
  that the net at large might enjoy it, too, so here it is with some
  additional notes from my experience at making it. Yield: Makes about 2
  cases.
  
  *  Lester's initial specific gravity was 1.086 and his final specific
  gravity was 1.020 (alcohol about 8 percent). His fermentation time was 11
  days (a slow batch).
  
  My batch fermented in about a week (house temperature ranging between 60
  and 68). It was barely drinkable after 6 weeks, but delicious after 3
  months.  As far as I can tell, it's still getting better (a year later),
  so try not to drink it all up right away.
  
  *  Ingredient note:  I didn't know what a licorice stick was, until I asked
  the clerk at my brewstore.  The one he gave me was about 1/3 inch in
  diameter and about 3 inches long. It was dark black, and not sweet to the
  taste at all. It seems to be a standard brewing ingredient. Sorry I can't
  be more specific about it.
  
  : Difficulty:  For experienced beer brewers only.
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, 2 weeks fermenting, 6 months aging.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.
