      Title: SELF-RISING FLOUR-SUBSTITUTION
 Categories: Instruction
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------SELF-RISING FLOUR--------------------------
      1 c  A.P. flour
  1 1/2 ts Leavining/baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
 
     Self-rising flour may ONLY BE USED in place of all purpose flour
  only if recipe you are making calls for salt and baking powder. When
  using self-rising flour in place of all purpose (A.P.) flour omit
  salt and leavening as indicated in amounts shown above.
  
     One problem with self-rising flour:  you can never be sure of the
  efficacy of its built-in leavener (baking powder). Long or improper
  storage will weaken its leavening power and may affect the final
  produce adversely.

      Title: SEMI-PICKLED CUCUMBERS
 Categories: Pickles, Can/cure, Russian, Jewish
      Yield: 36 Pickles
 
           Blackcurrant / cherry leaves
     36 sm Cucumbers
     24    Peppercorns
      6    Cloves garlic
      6    Bay leaves
      3    Red chilis
      6    Stalks fresh dill in bud
      2 qt Water
    3/4 c  Coarse salt; 6 oz
      4 tb Vinegar; optional
 
  "In Russia 'semi-pickled' cucumbers, made at the end of the summer,
  kept in brine for three to four days, are particularly popular. In
  addition to dill, which is the all important flavour, the container
  ~- usually an earthenware crock -- is often lined with oak,
  blackcurrant or cherry leaves. In Israel vine leaves are used for
  this purpose."
  
  Line three 2-lb (1 kg) jars with a few washed and dried blackcurrant
  or cherry leaves.
  
  Wash cucumbers, dry, and pack into jars in layers, putting them in
  vertically and fitting them in tightly. Sprinkle each layer with
  peppercorns and slip a couple of garlic cloves, a bay leaf, and a red
  chili between the layers. Insert a couple of good dill stalks in each
  jar.
  
  Bring water to the boil with salt, allow this brine solution to cool,
  and pour over cucumbers. There should be enough bring to come to
  about 1 inch above the cucumbers.
  
  Cover with a well-fitting lid, if necessary put a weight on top. The
  cucumbers must not be allowed to float up -- hence the weight. But
  you must also make sure that the lid and weight, or whatever you use
  for cover, does not press directly on the cucumbers, as this may
  cause bruising.
  
  Leave in a cool dry place until ready, which can be from one to three
  weeks, dependent on climate. Should there be any evaporation of the
  liquid, make up more brine and top up. Allow six tablespoons coarse
  salt per quart of water for the brine solution.
  
  If you like the taste of vinegar in your dill pickles, add two
  tablespoons of vinegar to 1 quart of bring solution and bring to the
  boil together. Then cool and use as described.

      Title: SEMLOR-LENTEN CREAM BUNS
 Categories: Desserts, Swedish
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
    1/8 lb Butter or margarine
      1 c  Milk
      1 oz Yeast
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1    Egg
      1 ts Ground cardamom
      3 c  Baking flour
      1    Lightly beaten egg
           Filling
           The scooped-out portion of
           Bread from the buns
  2 1/2 oz Almond paste
    1/4 c  Cream or milk
           Garnish
      1 c  Whipping cream
           Powdered sugar
 
  To make the buns: crumble the yeast in a bowl.  Melt the butter or
  margarine in a saucepan, add the milk, heat until lukeward (not over
  100 degrees).  Remove from heat and stir in the yeast until it is
  completely absorbed.  Gradually stir in the salt, sugar, one egg,
  cardamom, and most of the flour.  Work the dough until smooth and
  shiny, then cover and let rise 30-40 minutes. On a floured surface
  knead the remaining flour into the dough.  Divide into 12 parts and
  hand roll into smooth round balls. Let rise 20-30 minutes on a
  greased cookie sheet. Set oven for 475 degrees. Brush with the beaten
  egg and bake in the middle of the oven 8-10 minutes until golden and
  baked through. Set them out to cool.
  
  To make the filling: cut off the top of each bun and scoop out a
  hollow in the bottom half with a spoon. Mix the scooped-out bits with
  the almond paste.  Add cream to thin the mixture to a soft, smooth
  consistency. Fill the buns with the almond-paste mixture and put the
  tops back on. Using stiff whipped cream in a pastry bag, squeeze out
  a wreath of whipped cream around the top of each bun, then sprinkle
  with powdered sugar and serve.

 Categories: Carbs, Viennese, Jewish, Heirloom
      Yield: 10 Knoedle
 
      8 oz Dryish kaiser rolls
      2 tb Margarine or fat of choice
      2 ea Eggs (maybe 3)
      1 c  Milk
      1 sm Onion, chopped
      2 tb Dried bread crumbs
  1 1/2 c  Flour
           Salt and papper to taste
      2 tb Fresh herbs, parsley,
           -chervil, marjoram,
           -(optional, but a great
           -improvement)
 
  You will need a frying pan, a small and a large bowl, and a pot of
  boiling water or soup to cook the knoedle in.
  
  Dice the bread. Meanwhile mix the egg and the milk in a small bowl
  and stir in the bread. Allow to stand for a half an hour or so.
  
  Saute the onion in the fat and add the dry bread crumbs.
  
  Turn the bread, milk, and egg mixture lightly. Add sauteed onion,
  flour and seasonings mixing lightly.
  
  Dip your hands in cold water and roll the mixture into about 8 or 10
  balls of dough. Have a pot of water coming to a boil if there isn't a
  pot of simmering soup waiting. Drop balls of dough into the boiling
  salted water or the soup. Poach them for 10 to 15 minutes, until they
  are light and firm and well risen.
  
  For firmer dumplings, add more milk and egg
  
  For fluffier dumplings, add more flour.
  
  These go very well with soup or stew but our favorite is with
  Hungarian Goulasch.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ts Active dry yeast
  1 7/8 c  Water -- 105-115 degrees
  1 1/4 c  Basic bread sponge
  3 1/2 c  Durum wheat flour
    1/3 c  Durum wheat flour -- for
           Kneading
    1/3 c  Yellow cornmeal
    1/4 c  Black sesame seeds
      4 ts Kosher salt
           Cornmeal -- for sprinkling
 
  Black sesame seeds may be available at health food stores or Japanese
  markets.
  
  In a bowl, dissolve  the yeast in the water.  Allow to proof for three
  minutes.
  
  Stir the sponge into the water, breaking the sponge up using your
  hands or a spoon.
  
  Add 3 1/2 cups of the durum flour, cornmeal, 2 tablespoons of sesame
  seeds, and the salt and mix, scraping and folding until the dough
  gathers into a single mass.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly
  floured surface, and knead the dough until smooth and elastic,
  gradually adding as much of the 1/3 cup of durum aas needed (but as
  little as you can get away with).
  
  Shape into a ball and place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover
  with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
  
  After removing the dough from the refrigerator, allow to sit for two
  hours in a draft-free location.
  
  Sprinkle a baking sheet, without sides, generously with cornmeal.
  Flour a worksurface.  Halve the dough and flatten each half gently
  into a 10x12 inch rectangle. Roll each rectangle tightly along a 10
  inch side, making two 12 inch cylinders.  Roll from the center
  towards the edge to make 20 inch ropes. Coil the rope from one end,
  pulling up the center knot. Place the coils on the baking sheet.
  
  Mist the loaves lightly using a plant sprayer.  Spoon a tablespoon of
  the seeds along each of the coils. Cover with plastic wrap and allow
  to double in a draft-free location. This should take 1 to 2 hours.
  
  Preheat the oven for at least thirty minutes along with a baking
  stone or tiles on the middle rack to 425. Place a baking pan with
  decent sides on the bottom shelf. Boil two cups of water. Pour the
  boiling water into the baking pan.   With a quick jerk, slide the
  loaves off the sheet and onto the stone.
  
  Bake for 25 minutes until the loaves are hollow sounding when tapped
  on the bottom.  When done, cool on a rack.
  
  Note:  Durum wheat is the hardest variety of wheat and makes a very
  high-gluten flour.  Durum is made from the same wheat as semolina,
  but is finely ground and is superior for making bread. It can be
  found in health food stores, specialty food markets, and some Italian
  markets.

      3 tb Wheat germ
  1 1/2 tb Sugar
    1/2 tb Salt

  In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.
  
  Semolina flour is the strong, silent type.  It has great tear
  (texture) and character, but a mild flavor that does not announce
  itself. Its understated nature lets this bread go anywhere with
  almost anything, alongside an assertive French or Italian sauce,
  around juicy roast meat, or under ripe cheese.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      5 tb Fat (veg/smoked bacon)
      1 tb Flour, rounded
      2 lb Onions, finely chopped
      3 ea Celery stalk, chop fine
      1 ea Bell pepper, med, chop fine
      1 ea Lemon, grated rind and pulp
      3 ea Garlic cloves, minced

      1 x  Thyme, dash
      1 x  Tabasco, dash
      1 x  Worcestershire, few dashes
      1 x  Season-All, few dashes
 
  To the hot fat add flour, stirring constantly, to make a
  scorchy-tasting roux. Add onions; fry slowly until thoroughly browned
  and reduced to pulp. Add rest of ingredients at one time and continue
  to cook slowly for at least 30-45 min. This recipe constitutes the
  Basic Sauce for gumbos, stews, jambalayas and sauce picuante. If
  thicker sauce is desired, make the roux with 2 to 4 Tbsp flour
  instead of one. THIS SAUCE will be used in Sen. Ellender's shrimp
  creole, jambalaya, chicken sauce picuante, courtbouillon and gumbo.
  Suggestions: Make lots of sauce and freeze individual use portions.

      1 lg Onion; finely chopped
      2    Garlic cloves; chopped
      1 ts Cayenne pepper; or more to
           -taste
      2 tb Peanut or vegetable oil
      2 tb Curry powder; such as
           -garam masala
      3 c  Chicken broth
     10 md Tomatoes; cut in half
           -crosswise, seeds squeezed
           -out, and coarsely chopped
           Or
      5 c  Canned tomatoes, drained and
           -seeded, and chopped
    2/3 c  Smooth peanut butter*
           Salt and pepper
           Sour Cream
           Lime wedges
 
  *It's better to use old-fashioned peanut butter without stabilizers
  to keep it from separating.
  
  In a 4-quart pot over medium heat, cook the onion, garlic, and cayenne
  pepper in the oil until the onion turns translucent, about 10
  minutes. Stir in the curry powder and stir the mixture over medium
  heat for 1 minute more.  Add the chicken broth and tomatoes, simmer
  for 10 minutes more, and strain the soup through the fine disk of a
  food mill or push it through a medium-mesh strainer with a ladle.
  
  Bring the soup to a simmer and whisk in the peanut butter. Season
  with salt and pepper and more cayenne if you want it hotter. Serve
  sour cream and lime wedges at the table.
  
  Suggestions and Variations: You can add a cup of coconut milk or heavy
  cream to give this soup extra richness and a nice velvety texture. The
  author adds a few tablespoons of chopped cilantro to it. If you want
  to make this into a substantial main course, saute a cut-up chicken
  in peanut oil, then simmer it in the soup for 15-20 minutes.

  2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      1 ts Mild vinegar or lemon juice
      1 ts Salt

MMMMM--------------------TO FINISH TURNOVERS-------------------------
      1    Recipe Sephardic spinach
           -filling
      1 lg Egg beaten with 1 tb water
           Sesame seeds (opt)
 
   Put the flour in a large bowl or on a pastry board and make a well
  in the center.
   Place the butter and oil in the well and cut in the fat until the
  mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
   Stir in the vinegar and salt into the ice water. Sprinkle the water,
  1 tablespoon at a time, over a section of the flour. Gently mix with
  a fork to moisten.
   Push the moistened section aside and continue adding enough water to
  make a soft dough that just holds together.
   Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead briefly with
  the heel of your hand.  Form into a ball, flatten slightly, cover
  with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes up to 1
  week. THe dough can also be frozen for up to 3 months.   Let the
  chilled dough stand at room temperature until workable, about 1 hour,
  before rolling.
   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
   Form the dough into 1-inch dough.  On a lightly floured surface,
  roll the balls into 3-inch rounds, about 1/8 inch thick.
   Place a heaping teaspoon of the filling in the center of each round,
  Fold the dough in half over the filling to form a half moon and press
  the rounded edge with the tines of a fork to seal. (Turnovers may be
  frozen at this point.  Do not defrost before baking; instead,
  increase the baking time by about 10 minutes) Place turnovers on a
  baking sheet. Brush the tops with egg wash and if desired, sprinkle
  with sesame seeds. Bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve
  warm or at room temperature.

  heat, cover, and simmer for 30-60 minutes, or until they are very
  soft and form a paste. During the cooking period, stir the dates
  often, and mash then with a spoon to help break them down. To smooth
  out the paste, press it through a sieve, colander, or food mill, or
  puree it in a food processor. If the puree is too thin and does not
  have a rich date taste, return it to the saucepan and simmer it down
  to the desired consistency, keeping in mind that it will thicken
  slightly more as it cools. Let the date paste cool to room
  temperature. Stir in the desired amounts of wine and cinnamon. Stir
  in the nuts and/or sprinkle them on top. Store the paste in the
  refrigerator, tightly covered, for up to 2 weeks. For the best
  flavor, let it come to room temperature before serving.

    3/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Sesame seeds, toasted
      1 tb Oil
  1 1/2 ts Soy sauce or Tamari
      1 c  Water
           Salt for the tops (opt.)
 
  "Set these Sesame Corn Chips next to a bowl of homemade guacamole for
  a surefire hors d'oeurves success. A pitcher of spiced tomato juice
  would provide a pleasing addition. 350~F. 18 to 25 minutes Preheat
  the oven to 350~F.
  
  Stir together the flours, salt, and toasted sesame seeds in a large
  bowl or in the food processor. Add the oil and blend until the
  mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the soy sauce and blend in enough
  of the water to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive
  ball.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll as thin as possible, to about 1/16
  inch. Sprinkle with salt if desired and roll over the top of the
  dough with the rolling pin to press in the salt. With a sharp knife,
  score the dough into 2-inch squares. Prick each square 2 or 3 times
  with the tines of a fork.
  
  Bake for 15 minutes. Turn over and continue baking another 32 to 20
  minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
  
  These crackers will crisp as they cool. If they are not crisp enough
  after cooling, put them back in the oven for a few minutes longer and
  allow them to cool again. Yield: 40-50.
  
  VARIATION: Try other roasted seeds, such as poppy seeds.

      Title: SESAME DRESSING
 Categories: Sauces, Salads, Pasta, Dressings
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/4 lb Sugar
    1/2 c  Red vinegar
    3/4 oz Onion; chopped
    1/8 ts Salt
           Paprika; to taste
      1 tb Dry mustard
  1 1/2 ts Worcestershire sauce
           Tabasco; to taste
    1/4 c  Salad oil
    1/4 oz Toasted sesame seeds
           Peanut butter; to taste
           Roasted garlic; to taste
 
  Prepare like a vinaigrette dressing. The dry mustard will be the
  emulsifier for the oil and vinegar.
  
  This won't have the peanutty taste that the other has, but you can
  experiment with the addition of peanut butter and garlic in this
  recipe. My suggestion is 2 tbsp of PB and 1 tbsp of roasted garlic.
  
  Also, you may want to convert this recipe. It yields about 1 1/2
  quarts.

  Karen's note:  This recipe has been resized to make about six
  2-tablespoon servings, so it will now yield about 3/4 cup of
  dressing. The notes from John regarding peanut butter and roasted
  garlic were for the original recipe, so you may decrease them as
  desired.

  eaten straight, with no milk.

           -(Dow-sah)
           Sesame seeds
           Oil for deep frying
 
  *Recipe is included in this collection. WRAPPING: Divide dough in
  half and separate each half into 12 portions. Roll each to form a
  ball. Flatten by hand to a 3 inch round. Put 1 teaspoon of red bean
  paste or sweet crescent filling in center, press opposite sides
  together to seal. Roll again in palms to form a round ball. Roll ball
  in sesame seeds. Repeat with rest of the dough. COOKING: Heat oil in
  wok over medium heat (350 degrees in a deep fryer). Deep fry four
  balls per batch, moving them constantly so they do not stay at the
  bottom. After 2-3 minutes, balls will start to float. Rotate them
  with chopsticks or a slotted spoon, gently pushing them against the
  side of the wok. (This action will help the balls retain a rounder
  shape). Continue frying them until the balls attain a medium golden
  brown color. (Approximately 8-10 minutes.) Drain on paper towel and
  cool for 5 minutes before serving. DO AHEAD NOTES: Jeen Dueys can be
  made ahead and kept refrigerated for several days. Reheat by deep
  frying or in oven at 350 degrees for 10 minutes. Source: "Dim Sum" by

      Title: SESAME SEEDS (KOREAN KAE)
 Categories: Korean, Condiments, Ethnic
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  A small supply of sesame seeds should be kept on hand if any korean
  cooking is planned. These seeds should always be crushed and roasted.
  
  1.  Pruchase a jar of white sesame seeds.
  
  2.  In a heavy skillet, over a very low flame brown the seeds until
  they turn dark golden. Shake the pan and stir the seeds from time to
  time. If the sesame seeds have browned carefully, they will pop and
  jump in the pan. Sesame seeds taste best when roasted to a dark
  golden color.
  
  3.  Allow the seeds to cool to room temperature in the pan. Crush
  them with a mortar and pestle or in a blender. Crushed in either
  manner, the juice from the seeds will escape. Stored in an air-tight
  jar, the seeds will keep for months.

      Title: SESAME SHRIMP TOAST
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Appetizers
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Peeled raw shrimp or prawns
      2    Egg whites
      3 c  Oil for deep-frying
      3 sl Day-old bread
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Cornstarch
      1 c  White sesame seeds
 
  These tasty dainties are quick and easy to prepare. They are a popu-
  lar snack and banquet dish that takes several forms, depending on
  budget and occasion.  The lesser tea houses stretch the shrimp by
  adding 1/3 soft-flesh fish.
  
  Preparation:  Peel and devein raw shrimp.  Chop, then mash, shrimp to
  soft pulp.  A cleaver or food processor works well for this. Mix
  shrimp meat with salt and cornstarch. Remove crust from bread; slice
  each into 6 rectangles.  We used heavy wheat bread, which gives a
  chewy texture; light white bread would be more crisp and absorb less
  oil. Separate eggs; beat whites to stiff peaks.  Fold egg whites
  completely into shrimp mixture.
  
  Deep-frying:  Because shrimp mixture is a little runny, wait until
  you are ready to deep-fry before spreading mixture on bread. Put
  about 1 teaspoon of mixture on each piece of bread. Set them on
  plate; sprin- kle with raw white sesame seeds.
  
  Heat oil slowly to medium hot.  Test with crust of bread; it should
  brown in 10 seconds.  Deep-fry 6 pieces at a time, shrimp side down,
  until they brown; then roll them over to brown the bread. Pieces are
  buoyant balls, which may be uncooperative, so keep an eye on them.
  Frying time is about 3 minutes.  After frying, remove to warm serving
  platter. Serve.
  
  After deep-frying, they keep for about 30 minutes in warm oven.
  However, they are best right out of deep-fryer. We suggest you fry a
  second batch midway through the buffet; to fry 18 takes about 7
  minutes.

 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 90 Servings
 
      5 tb Sesame seeds, toasted
      2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Oil
    1/2 c  Water
      1    Egg, lightly beaten and
           Diluted with 1 to 2 Tb milk
           For brushing the tops
 
  "The flavor of sesame comes through very nicely in these crispy
  crackers. Try them wih your favorite chutney or with cream cheese and
  jam. If you are feeling extravagant, spread them with sour cream and
  caviar. 325~ F 20 to 25 minutes Preheat the oven to 325~ F. In a food
  mill or blender, grind the sesame seeds until coarsely broken. A food
  processor will not effectively grind this small quantity. If
  preferred, you can leave the seeds whole. In a large bowl or in the
  food processor, stir together the flour, seeds, and salt. Add the oil
  and blend until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Blend in enough of
  the water, a little at a time, to form a dough that will hold
  together in a cohesive ball. If necessary, add up to 1 additional
  Tablespoon of water. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for
  rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll to 1/16 inch
  thick. With a sharp knife or cookie cutter, cut in desired shapes
  approximately 2 inches across. Arrange on an ungreased baking sheet.
  Prick each cracker in 2 or 3 places with the tines of a fork. Brush
  the tops lightly with the egg mixture. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or
  until the crackers are light to medium brown. Cool on a rack. Yield:
  85-90.

      3 lb Spareribs
 
  In a large pot, combine first seven ingredients. Cut spare ribs into
  serving size pieces (I prefer small back ribs for this recipe) and
  place in pot with sauce. bring to a boil and simmer for 30 minutes,
  turning ribs occasionally. Remove ribs from sauce and place in a
  single layer in a shallow baking pan. Skim fat from sauce and baste
  meat with some of the sauce. Bake at 350 for 30 minutes or until
  tender, occasionally turning and basting with remaining sauce. Broil
  ribs for about 5 minutes to finish browning. Note: Par-boiled ribs
  can be grilled on the barbecue, but baste with sauce only during the
  last 5 minutes. I usually serve these ribs with steamed rice and a
  leafy salad. I hope you enjoy these ribs as much as I do. JOYCE in

      Title: SETTIN' 'ROUND BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
    1/4 c  Water
           -(at 105 degrees)
    1/3 c  Turbinado sugar
           -(most any sugar will
           -do, though)
      2 pk Yeast (dry), active
    1/4 c  Butter
    1/4 c  Shortening
  1 1/2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Milk
      1 lg Egg
      1 c  Dry milk, non-fat
  1 1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Honey
    1/8 ts Cinnamon, ground
    1/2 c  Rolled oats
    1/2 c  Cornmeal
    1/4 c  Bran
    1/4 c  Cracked wheat
    1/4 c  Buckwheat
    1/2 c  Soy flour
      1 c  Rye flour
  2 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
      3 c  White flour
           Butter
 
  Melt the shortening and the butter.  Let them cool a bit, so as not
  to kill the yeast when they are added to the dough. If you want to
  scald the milk, do so, and also let it cool (it is common practice to
  scald milk before baking with it, though I never do.)
  
  Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the 1/4 cup of lukewarm water.
  
  Mix the cinnamon, oats, corn meal, bran, cracked wheat, buckwheat, soy
  flour and rye flour. Add the rest of the water, the milk, butter,
  shortening, egg and honey, and mix well. Stir in the dissolved yeast
  mixture.  Mix in the salt and the whole wheat flour.
  
  Stir in the white flour, about 1/2 cup at a time, until the mixture is
  stiff enough to knead. You'll probably have about half of it left.
  
  Remove the dough from the mixing bowl, onto a floured surface. Knead
  the dough, adding more white flour as necessary to keep the dough
  workable. Knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic, about ten
  minutes. It's okay if you end up using less than or more than the
  three cups of white flour; just use whatever it takes.
  
  Put the dough back into a bowl that's been very lightly greased. Let
  it rise, covered, in a still, warm place (around 85 degrees F. is
  best, though room temperature will work) for 45 minutes, or until it
  has doubled in bulk.
  
  Punch the dough down, divide in half, shape into loaves and place
  each half into a loaf pan which has been very lightly greased. Let
  rise again, for another 45 minutes, in a still, warm place, until the
  loaves have about doubled in bulk.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. as the bread finishes rising. Bake
  the bread for 35-40 minutes, until it sounds hollow when tapped.
  Remove from the loaf pans and rub the top of the loaves with some
  butter to give them a nice, soft, chewy crust.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A 7-grain bread for toasting or eating plain -- This bread was
  first made from whatever was settin' 'round the kitchen when I
  started baking. It has a wonderful texture and flavor. Yield: 2 large
  loaves.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  about 3 hours (half of it rising time).
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

  Fourteen pounds of good salt, half a pound of salpetre, two quarts of
  molasses or four pounds of coarse brown sugar, with water enough to
  dissolve the salt, and a pint of good beer or of vinegar, if you
  command either.  Bring this liquor to a boil, and scum off all the
  impurities that may rise to the surface. When cold, pour this over
  your hams,which should be cold, but not frozen. The addition of
  pepper, allspice, and cloves is made by some who like a high flavour
  to the hams. The hams should remain in this pickle six or eight
  weeks; being turned and basted every two or three days, and then hung
  in the smoke house. The best woods for smoking are: sugar maple
  chips, hickory, birch, corn cobs, white ash, and beech. Wehn removed
  from the smoke house, sew each ham in any old linen or cotton cloth,
  and if you give this covering a coating of whitewash, with a
  whitewash brush, it well preserve it from the flies.

  1 1/4 c  Water
    3/4 c  7 grain mix

  1 1/2 ts Yeast
  1 1/2 tb Margarine
 
  I bought a bag of "7-grain mix" (Stone-Burh) and came up with the
  following recipe for the BM.  My goal was to come up with a "Poulsbo
  Bread". This is very very close to the commercial product - only a
  lot fresher tasting. About the only thing missing is sunflower seeds,
  which I will try adding next time. I hope you like this. We ate an
  entire loaf in one sitting (and there are only two of us!) Put
  ingredients into pan in order listed. Bake at regular setting. One
  more thing: this is a soft bread and will be difficult to slice when
  hot. If you are going to use it in a sandwich, allow it to cool
  first. Regards,   *** Gaye in Bellevue, WA *** 10/01 01:34 pm

  4 - 3 oz. Pkgs. Jello (green, orange, yellow and red) 2 envelopes Knox
  unflavored gelatin 1 pint sour cream 2 C. milk 1 cup sugar Vanilla
  
  Grease 9 x 13 x 2" dish with Pam or salad oil.
  
  1.   Dissolve 1 pkg. green Jello with 1 cup hot water, add 1/2 cup
  cold water. Pour into dish and put into refrigerator to set. 2. Bring
  to boil 2 cups milk; add 1 cup sugar, mix until sugar is dissolved.
  3. Dissolve the 2 envelopes of Knox gelatin in 1/2 cup cold water.
  Add this to the milk and sugar. 4. Add 2 cups sour cream and 2 tsp.
  vanilla to above mixture; blend with an electric mixer until just
  blended. When mixture is fairly cool, put 1 1/2 cups on set green
  layer. Put back into refrigerator to set. When it is sticky to touch,
  it is ready for the next layer. 5. Same as #1, except use orange
  Jello. When Jello is cool, add to the white layer and set into
  refrigerator until firm. Next--white layer, lemon, white, then red.
  
  It takes each layer about 30-45 minutes to set. Time can be shortened
  by making Jello and setting it aside to cool so that it is ready to
  put on top of white layer as soon as white layer is firm.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2    Head of Iceburg Lettuce
           - chopped
      1 c  Clery, chopped
      1 c  Green pepper, chopped
      1    Med. onion, sliced or diced
      1    Box (10 oz.) frozen peas
      1 lb Bacon, fried and crumbled
      5    Hard boiled eggs, sliced
      2 c  Mayonaise
      2 tb Sugar
      3 c  Shredded Cheddar cheese
 
  Note: The name in the family recipe book is "Seven Layer Salad."
  Don't ask me why?  It really isn't seven layers, but it has become my
  favorite. (BC)
  
  Using a fairly deep baking dish (I use a 4" deep 9" X 9" pyrex pan),
  place a bed of chopped lettuce on the bottom, then lay down a layer
  of celery, then onion, then green peppersm then peas, then eggs. The
  order is really not that important, and they will nor really
  constitute a solid "layer."
  
  Then and another layer of lettuce and repeat the procedure.
  
  Mix mayonaise and sugar together and spread on top.
  
  Sprinkle bacon and cheddar cheese on top of the whole thing.
  
  Cover tightly and leave overnight in refrigerator, allowing mayonaise
  to permeate the whole thing. From Bumgarner Family Recipes submitted

      Title: SEVEN PEPPER CHILI-PART 2
 Categories: Chili, Chocolate
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           See directions
 
     This recipe is a lot of trouble and is recommended only for genuine
  chili fanatics.
      Brown meat in lard until gray.  Add onions and cook until clear.
  Combine in a food processor or blender the cumin, garlic, chilies
  pasillas, chiliie quebrados, t Tabasco, salt, jalapenos, and
  tomatoes. Blend and set aside to steep. Remove stems, membranes, and
  seeds from dried anchos, red chiles, and jalapenos peppers. Place
  these last three peppers in a small saucepan and barely cover with
  warm water. Bring to a boil over medium heat and then simmer about 15
  minutes. Next place softened peppers in the processor or blender.
  Save the water in which you boiled the peppers. You can use this
  water to hotten up the chili later.
    Now blend the peppers with the  tomato mixture until smooth and add
  all this to the cooking meat and onions. Add sugar, beer, and
  chocolate to chili.  Turn the fire down real low and simmer without
  covering - at least 2 hours. Stir occasionally to keep it from
  sticking. Keep quart of water nearby.  Add as needed to keep a soupy
  consistency. Thirty minutes before you are ready to serve chili
  combine masa with enough water to make a thin paste and, stirring
  vigorously, add to the chili. This will bind the chili and thicken it
  up. Stir chili frequently during the last half hour so that it
  doesn't stick.  You can taste it at this point, and if it isn't hot
  enough to suit you, pour in a little of the seasoned water in which
  you cooked the chiles. This is liquid fire, so go easy. Pour a little
  and taste.  Also adjust the salt during this half hour.

      Title: SEVEN STEP JERKY
 Categories: Meats, Dehydrator
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 lb Venison
    1/2 c  Soy sauce
    1/2 c  Worcestershire sauce
      2 ts MSG
      2 ts Seasoned salt
    2/3 ts Garlic powder
      2 ts Onion powder
    2/3 ts Pepper
 
  Slice three pounds of venison into strips about 1/8 inch thick to
  ensure total saturation of the meat while it's marinating. Partial
  freezing beforehand aids in slicing thin. Combine all ingredients in
  a bowl. Stir this mixture well with a spoon to dissolve all of the
  soluble ingredients. Now the marinaade is ready to be used. Place the
  strips of meat in the marinade, be sure they're completely submerged.
  Marinate overnight, turning if necessary.  Lay marinated meat strips
  on oven rack. Cook for 6 to 8 (6 is better) at 150 degrees. They get
  crisper the longer they bake. Store finished jerky in zip-lock bags
  or other airtight containers to seal in freshness.  Jerky will keep
  up to two years. A good book on making beef jerky and other
  light-weight foods is:

      Title: SEVEN VEGETABLE COUSCOUS
 Categories: Digest, Oct.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 pk Couscous
      1 ts Turmeric
      2 md Onions, chopped
      1 c  Finely shredded cabbage
      1 md Turnip, peeled and diced
      1 md Yellow summer squash,
           Chopped in 1/4" pieces
  1 1/2 c  Cooked garbanzo beans
  1 1/2 c  Diced ripe tomatoes
      1 ts Freshly grated ginger root
    1/2 ts Each: ground cumin,
           Coriander, turmeric
        x  Water as needed
 
  Prepare couscous according to package, stirring in couscous when you
  fluff it. Or try substituting brown rice. I was out of couscous last
  week, so I used brown rice with turmeric and it was wonderful! Saute
  onions until tender in a large saucepan or soup pot using your
  favorite oil substitute. Add remaining ingredients except water.
  Cover and reduce heat to low. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 to
  20 min. Add water as needed to produce a moist, but not soupy stew.
  Serve over couscous or brown rice.
  
  To make some of this easier, I used canned chickpeas. You could
  probably use canned tomatoes as well.  One ingredient I wouldn't dare
  leave out is the fresh ginger root !! I store my ginger root in the
  freezer wrapped in plastic.  When I want to use some, I take out a
  chunk, peel as much as I want to use and grate, it grates much easier
  when frozen.

      2 tb Water
      2 tb Rice vinegar
      1 tb Oyster sauce

      1 ts Sugar
      1 ea Clove garlic, crushed
      2 tb Oil

MMMMM-------------------------RICE DISH------------------------------
      1 ea Small yellow  onion
  1 1/2 c  Celery, cut on the diagonal
      1 c  Carrots, cut on the diagonal
      1 c  Cooked, cubed meat, any
    1/2 c  Red or green pepper, diced
      3 c  Cooked, cooled rice
      1 c  Sugar snap peas or snow peas
 
  * Rice should be preferably a day old. Remove stems from peas. Meat
  can be
    lean chicken, turkey or pork.
    Combine all the ingredients for the sauce in a 2-cup mixing bowl.
  Stir
    vigorously with a fork until the sugar has dissolved. Place near the
    stove where it will be handy.
    Assemble the remaining ingredients near the stove in individual
  piles or
    dishes. Precook the carrots 1 minute in a microwave oven on high
  (100
    percent) power. The carrots also may be blanched in boiling water 2
    minutes to tenderize them.
    Place the oil in a wok or large skillet, Set over high heat and
  allow oil
    to become quite hot.  Add the onions first, stirring occasionally
  until
    they begin to caramelize and turn brown around the edges. Add the
  celery
    and stir 2 minutes longer. Add the carrots, meat and bell pepper
  and cook
    2 minutes longer, stirring constantly.
    Add the rice all at once, stirring quickly to mix all ingredients.
  (Some
    rice may begin to stick to the sides of the wok or skillet, but
  continue
    stirring.) Add the peas and pour in sauce mixture. Stir until
  mixture is
    evenly colored with the sauce. Remove from heat and serve
  immediately.
    Test kitchen notes: The choice of ingredients is up to the cook. If
    desired, substitute bulb fennel or green onions for celery; peeled,
    deveined and cooked shrimp or lump crab meat for the meat; or
  English
    peas for snow peas. Remember to use low-fat ingredients to keep the
    calories from fat below 30 percent.

      Title: SEVEN-UP POUND CAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Regular Margarine
    1/2 c  Shortening
      3 c  Sugar
      5 lg Eggs
      3 c  Unbleached Flour (Cake
           Flour Was Not Specified)
      2 tb Lemon Extract
      1 c  7-Up (Room Temperature)
 
  This is an old recipe that comes from a request in the local paper for
  "Classic Recipes".  They called the 7-Up bottling company and they
  did not even know about it. Someone developed this on their own and
  never let the company know about it.  BTW 7-Up comes from the popular
  card game in the 1930's.
  
  Cream the margarine, shortening and sugar together beating until
  light and fluffy.  Add the eggs, one at a time, blending well after
  each addition. Beat in the flour, then beat in the extract and 7-Up.
  Blend well. Pour the batter into a well-greased and floured tube pan
  and bake at 325 degrees F for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

      Title: SEVICHE ACAPULCO
 Categories: Fish, Appetizers, Mexico
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Turbot fish,
           -in fillets
      1    Onion, chopped
      2    Tomatoes, chopped
      1    Avocado, chopped
      1 c  Green olives (small)
      6 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Parsley, chopped
      1 c  Lime juice
      1    Serrano chile, chopped
      1 tb Ketchup
      1 tb White wine
      2    Jalapeno chilies,
           -chopped
      2 oz Capers
 
  Cut the fish fillets into about 1-inch cubes. Marinate it for at
  least 6 hours (preferably overnight) in about 1/2 cup of lime juice.
  
  Rinse the fish in a colander and let it dry for 5 minutes. Put it in a
  large bowl along with the rest of the lime juice. Put in the rest of
  the ingredients. Add salt, pepper and oregano to taste. Mix. Serve
  with salted crackers.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A tasty, marinated fish appetizer from Mexico -- This recipe comes
  from the Delicias Culinarias cookbook that I brought from Mexico. The
  introduction to the recipe reads: "Seviche is prepared with raw
  marinated fish.  It is very popular in Ecuador, Peru and in the north
  of Chile. Depending on the region in Mexico, there exist several
  different styles to prepare it.  This recipe comes from the Acapulco
  region".
  
  I am sure that you have tasted this appetizer if you have ever been
  to a beach in Mexico. It is usually served right where you are
  "roasting" in the sun or swimming. Yes, the fish in this recipe is
  raw. However it is "cooked" by marinating it in lime juice.
  
  *  Use fresh lime juice.  You can use any kind of fish that you like
  with the condition that it does not fall apart after marinating. For
  instance, it does not work with white fish.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes (after marinating the fish).
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

 Categories: Middle east, Arab states, Meat, Lamb, Time/life
      Yield: 16 Pies
 
           DOUGH:
  2 3/4 c  Water; lukewarm (110 to 115
           ;degrees)
      2 pk Active dry yeast
        pn Sugar
      8 c  All purpose flour
      2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Olive oil
           FILLING:
      2 c  Onion; finely chopped
      1 tb Salt
      2 ts Salt
      4 tb Olive oil
    1/2 c  Pine nuts; (pignolia)
      2 lb Lamb; lean, boneless and
           ;coarsely ground
      2 md Tomato; fresh, ripe, peeled,
           ;seeded and finely chopped
    1/2 c  Green pepper; finely chopped
    1/2 c  Parsley; finely chopped
           ;prefer flat leaf parsley
    1/2 c  Lemon juice, fresh
    1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
      1 tb Tomato paste
      1 ts Cayenne pepper
      1 ts Allspice
      2 ts Salt
           Black pepper; freshly ground
 
    Make the dough in the following fashion:  pour 1/4 cup of the
  lukewarm water into a small, shallow bowl and sprinkle it with the
  yeast and sugar.
   Let the mixture rest for 2 or 3 minutes, then stir to dissolve the
  yeast completely.  Set the bowl in a warm, draft free place (such as
  a turned off oven) for about 5 minutes, or until the mixture almost
  doubles in volume.
    In a deep mixing bowl, combine the flour and the 2 teaspoons of
  salt, make a well in the center and into it pour the yeast mixture,
  the 1/4 cup of olive oil, and 2 cups of the remaining lukewarm water.
  Gently stir the center ingredients together with a large spoon, then
  slowly incorporate the flour and continue to beat until the
  ingredients are well combined. Add up to 1/2 cup more lukewarm water,
  beating it in a tablespoon or so at a time, and using as much as
  necessary to form a dough that can be gathered into a compact ball.
  If the dough is difficult to stir, work in the water with your
  fingers.
    Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead it by
  pressing it down, pushing it forward several times with the heel of
  your hand and folding it back on itself. Repeat for about 20 minutes,
  or until the dough is smooth and elastic.  Sprinkle it from time to
  time with a little flour to prevent it from sticking to the board.
    Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl.
  Drape loosely with a kitchen towel and set aside in the warm, draft
  free place for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the dough doubles in
  bulk. Punch the dough down with a single blow of your fist and divide
  it into 16 equal pieces.  Roll each piece into a ball about 1 1/2
  inches in diameter, cover the balls with a towel and let them rest
  for 30 minutes.
  
  FILLING:
    Meanwhile, prepare the filling.  Drop the onions into a deep bowl
  and sprinkle them with 1 tablespoon of the salt, turning them about
  with a spoon to coat them evenly. Let the onions rest at room
  temperature for at least 30 minutes, then squeeze them dry and return
  them to the bowl.
    In a small skillet or saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil
  until a light haze forms above it.  Add the pine nuts and, stirring
  constantly, brown them lightly. Add them to the bowl of onions, along
  with the lamb, tomatoes, green pepper, parsley, lemon juice, vinegar,
  tomato paste, cayenne pepper, allspice, 2 teaspoons of salt and a
  liberal grinding of black pepper.  Knead the mixture vigorously with
  both hands, then beat with a wooden spoon until the mixture is smooth
  and fluffy. Taste for seasoning.
    Preheat the oven to 500 degrees (F).  With a pastry brush, coat 3
  large baking sheets or jelly roll pans with the remaining 3
  tablespoons of oil.
    On a lightly floured surface, roll each of the balls into a round
  about 4 inches in diameter and no more than 1/8 inch thick. to make
  open face pies, spoon about 1/2 cup of the lamb filling mixture on
  the center of each round.  Then with a spatula or the back of the
  spoon, spread the filling to about 1/2 inch of the edge.
    To make closed pies, spoon about 1/2 cup of the filling on the
  center of each round.  Pull up the edge from 3 equally distant points
  to make a roughly triangular shaped pie and pinch the dough securely
  together at the top.
    With a metal spatula, arrange the pies on the baking sheets. Bake
  in the lower third of the oven for 30 minutes, or until the pastry is
  lightly browned. Serve hot, or at room temperature, accompanied, if
  you like, with yogurt.

      Title: SFOGLIATELLE
 Categories: Italian, Desserts
      Yield: 12 Shells
 
           Pastry
      3 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Shortening
    1/2 c  Melted shortening
           ***
           Filling
  1 1/2 lb Ricotta
      8 tb Confectioners sugar
      3 tb Minced candied orange and
           -citron peel
      2    Eggs
      1 tb All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Vanilla
      1    Egg white
           Melted shortening
           Confectioners sugar
 
  Sift flour and salt and turn into bowl.  Cut in shortening with
  fingers to mealy consistency.  Add enough water (approx. 1/2 c) to
  hold mixture together. Dough should be not too hard or too soft
  (similar to egg noodle dough).  Knead well several minutes.  Form
  into ball and refrigerate for 30 minutes to enable it to lose
  elasticity and roll out easily. Roll dough very thin on lightly
  floured board into rectangular pice measuring about 28 x 24 inches.
  Cut edges evenly, then cut into 4 pieces lengthwise, 28 x 6 inches.
  Using a brush, spread melted shortening generously and evenly over
  one strip, top with second strip and spread with shortening. Repeat
  with the third and fourth strips, separating each strip by a layer of
  shortening.  Let shortening cool and set.  Using great care, roll four
  strips together, as for jelly roll, starting from shorter end. Wrap
  in wax paper and refrigerate about 15 minutes. Remove wax paper and
  cut ends evenly using a short thing knige.  Cut roll into 12 1/2 inch
  pieces (For easier cutting, dip knife in flour before cutting dough).
  Slices will resemble narrow rolls of ribbon.  Place on lightly
  floured board and sprinkle lightly with flour. Gently place rolling
  pin a center of slice and roll out from center toward left. Return
  rolling pin to center and roll out from center toward right.  The
  slice, fromerly round, will be a larger and thinger oval shape.
  Gently roll again from center toward top with one stroke and from
  center toward bottom with one stroke. The oval should measure about 7
  1/2 inches at its longest part. Placed prepared oval on lightly
  floured board, rolled side down. Proceed as above with the other
  pieces, arranging finished ovals on board, side by side. Prepare
  Filling: Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Drain ricotta through cheese
  cloth until quite dry.  Place in bowl, stir in remaining ingredients
  and blend throroughly.  Place a tb or two of ricotta mixture on lower
  half of each oval, wet edges of dough with a little egg white and
  fold over filling, bringing narrow edges together to form a
  shell-like shape. Press edges together tightly to seal in filling.
  Brush each shell with melted shortening.  Bake about 15 minutes, then
  quickly brush more melted shortening over shells using light, gentle
  strokes. Close oven door quickly, lower heat to 350 and bake another
  20 minutes. Brush once more with shortening. Pastries will puff up
  and have a beautiful golden color showing shell-like ribs or lines.
  Lower heat to 250 and bake another 5 to 10 minutes.  Cool on rack.
  When cold, durst with confectioners sugar.

  low fire over night. It should cook 18 to 24 hours.
  
  The water should not boil dry, nor should a high fire be used, or it
  will burn.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  European Jewish traditional sabbath stew -- This is a food that
  religious Jewish people eat on Saturday afternoon. Religious people
  do not cook on Saturday, so this food must be put on the stove on
  Friday, before sunset. It then cooks overnight, filling the house
  with a delicious aroma, until after services Saturday afternoon.
  Shabbos means "Saturday" in Hebrew, and choulnt means "a mishmosh" in
  Yiddish. (choulnt in fact comes originally from the French chaud lent
  which means "warm slowly") The amount of each ingredient depends on
  what taste one likes, how much is available, and the tradition handed
  down by one's parents or Rebbitzin (Rabbi's wife). Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  Variations:  Some communities add some eggs (in the shell), and
  lots of curry.  (in which case it is called Chamin, which means "warm
  food.")
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 day cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

    1/4 c  Golden raisins
    1/2 ts Cardamom powder
 
  Place cashew nuts in small bowl and cover with hot water. Soak 30
  minutes and drain most of the water. Blend nuts in blender until they
  form a somewhat smooth paste that retains some texture. Heat oil in a
  saucepan or wok and saute the onions until golden brown. "Splutter
  fry" 1/2 teaspoon of the garam masala powder, and reserve the
  remainder to garnish the finished dish. Quickly add garlic, ginger,
  red chili powder, coriander powder and turmeric powder to the pan.
  Add the chicken and mix well until the meat is sealed with the
  spices, about 2 minutes. Mix in tomatoes and simmer until the chicken
  is cooked. Then add the cashew paste and cream. Bring to a boil. If
  needed, correct the consistency of the dish by adding water. You want
  a smooth, slightly thick sauce. Raise heat and "fimmer" dish until
  the oil floats on top. Add raisins. Garnish with remaining garam
  masala and cardamom powder. Serves 2 as a main dish, 4 if served with
  other dishes.

 Categories: Vegetables, Punjabi
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
    250 g  Cabbage
      2 md Onions
      6    Garlic cloves
      2 tb Ghee or oil
    1/2 ts Garam masala
    1/2 ts Turmeric powder
      1 ts Ground cumin seeds
      1 tb Coriander powder
      2 tb Yogurt
      1 md Tomato; diced
  1 1/2 tb Gram flour
      1    Handful of sliced coriander
           -- (leaves)
           Salt; to taste
           Chili powder; to taste
 
  Grind onion and garlic to a paste.  Mix together gram flour, salt and
  chili powder with enough water to make a thin batter. Cut cabbage
  into long, thin slices. Dip cabbage slices in batter and deep fry
  until light golden. Drain and set aside. Heat ghee or oil in skillet
  and cook onion and garlic paste until golden. Add spices and cook
  another minute, then add tomatoes and continue to cook until ghee or
  oil begins to separate and rise to the top. Mash mixture with the
  back of a wooden spoon, then add 2 cups of water. Bring mixture to a
  boil, then reduce heat and add cabbage. Cook until cabbage is tender
  and sauce is thick. Garnish with chopped coriander and serve. [I
  guess you can add yogurt at the same time as the spices, although I
  substituted a bit of lemon juice, and added a couple of cups of water
  to this, and it was pretty good. The water seemed to be necessary, as
  the sauce was VERY dry otherwise.  -K.M.]

  Put the garlic,  ginger,  almonds,  and 6 tablespoons water in a
  blender and blend until you have a paste. Heat the oil in a wide,
  heavy, preferable non-stick pot or wok over a medium-high heat. When
  hot. put in just enough meat pieces so they lie, uncrowded in a
  single layer. Brown the meat pieces on all sides, then remove them
  with a slotted spoon and put them in a bowl. Brown all the meat this
  way. Put the cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon into the hot oil. Within
  seconds the cloves will expand. Now put in the onions. Stir and fry
  the onions until they turn a brownish color. Turn the heat down to
  medium.
   Put in the paste from the blender as well as the coriander, cumin,
  and cayenne. Stir  and fry this mixture for 3-4 minutes or until it
  too has browned somewhat. Now put in the meat cubes as well as any
  liquid that might have accumulated in the meat bowl, the salt, the
  cream, and rest of the water or broth (a bit more for beef). Bring to
  a boil. Cover, turn heat to  low  and simmer lamb for 1 hour and beef
  for 2 hours. Stir frequently during this cooking period. Skim off any
  fat that floats to the top. Sprinkle in the garam masala and mix.

        3 tb Chili powder
        1 tb Dry mustard
  
  Note:
  
  These instructions are for beginning smoke/cooker enthusiasts. It
  should work equally well in the Brinkman type of water/cookers as
  well as most other cookers. The main requirement is the ability to
  maintain the cooking chamber temperature between 180 and 250 degrees
  and the cooker must have a water pan to maintain the humidity close
  to 100%. Add all of the ingredients for the rub into a ziplock bag
  and mix thoroughly. Add the ribs, shake throughly to ensure complete
  covering of the ribs and store in the refrigerator overnight.
  
  About 5 1/2 - 6 hours before you plan on serving the ribs, fire up the
  smoker and make the sauce.  To make the sauce, saute the onion and
  garlic in a little oil until golden brown. Then add the remaining
  ingredients and stir frequently until everything is totally
  dissolved. Cook on simmer for about 30 minutes.
  
  Once the cooker has settle down to a good bed of coals, place the
  ribs on the grill over a pan of cold water. Let smoke, covered and
  undisturbed for about 2 hours. At that point, open the smoker lid and
  basted the ribs well with the mop, taking this opportunity to check
  the coals in the fire pan and the liquid level in the water pan.
  Replenish as needed, adding wet wood for plenty of smoke as well.
  Cook the ribs for 3 hours more, turning and basting them after 1 hour
  and agian after 2 hours. As always in smoke cooking, precise timing
  is not terribly important here. Just keep the smoke up and the
  temperature between 180 and 240 degrees and be liberal with your
  mopping.
  
  By the end of their 5 hours on the grill, the ribs will have long
  since reached the required internal temperature of 185 for fresh
  pork, but you can't overdoo ribs by smoking, and the long, slow
  cooking will have rendered them tender to a tee.
  
  About 10 minutes before you are ready to serve the ribs, treat them
  to a final mop, letting it set to a tantalizingly rich glaze over
  what may be the most succelent ribs you've ever tasted.
  
  For finger-licking aficionados, provide yet more hot mop sauce served
  up in dipping bowls.  A finger bowl for cleaning the hands will be
  appreciated and many, many napkins for cleaning up... Enjoy

      Title: SHAKE -N- BAKE
 Categories: Mixes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 c  Dry  bread crumbs
      1 ts Pepper
    1/4 c  Canola oil
      1 tb Onion powder
      2 ts Salt  (or omit)
      1 tb Garlic powder
      1 tb Paprika
      1 tb Bell's season'g
      2 ts Ground celery seed
 
  Put the dry crumbs in a large bowl and mix the oil in thoroughly with
  a whisk or pastry blender.  (When fully mixed through, you get a
  negligible amount per serving when coating anything.) Then mix in the
  rest of the ingredients.  Use your imagination.  You could make a 1/2
  recipe and use Italian seasoning instead of Bells; add sesame or
  poppy seeds, lemon pepper, etc. It does need that little oil to stick
  to things and brown properly.  The original recipe I adapted it from
  used much more oil. At least there is no MSG or other chemicals or
  preservatives in this. I keep mine in the freezer. It takes 45 min at
  375 degrees to brown.

      1 tb Dark molasses
    3/4 c  Milk
    1/2 ts Ground ginger
      2 lg Eggs
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
  1 1/4 c  Pumpkin puree, prefer fresh*
      1 pn Salt 1/2 c  Sugar
      1 c  Heavy cream, cold
      2 tb Unsalted butter, melted
 
  This spicy pumpkin pie can be made a day ahead and kept, lightly
  covered, at room temperature until serving time.  To serve in the
  Pleasant Hill (a Shaker Village in Kentucky featured in the article)
  style, accompany with a bowl of whipped cream.  Make Flaky Pie Crust.
  Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Heat milk in small heavy saucepan over
  medium heat until small bubbles form around edges of pan; remove from
  heat. Beat eggs lightly in large bowl until frothy.  Add scalded milk
  in thin steady stream, stirring constantly; stir in remaining
  ingredients except for cream.  Whisk until thoroughly blended.  Pour
  filling into prepared crust; bake until center is firm and small
  knife inserted in center of pie is withdrawn clean, about 45 minutes.
  Cool completely on wire rack. At serving time, beat cream in chilled
  small mixer bowl with chilled beaters until soft peaks form. Transfer
  to serving bowl and serve with pie. TIP: *For fresh pumpkin puree,
  split a medium pumpkin crosswise; remove and discard seeds and
  fibers. Place pumpkin, cut side down, on lightly greased baking
  sheet; bake in 325 degrees F oven until tender when pierced with
  knife, about 1 hour. Scrape pulp away from skin; discard skin.  Place
  pulp in blender or food processor fitted with metal blade; process in
  batches, until smooth. Force puree through coarse sieve. Measure 1.25
  cups puree for recipe; reserve remainder for other purpose.  Pumpkin
  puree can be frozen, tightly covered, up to 6 months. If using canned
  pumpkin, use solid-pack, unsweetened. FROM: "Shaker Thanksgiving",

    1/4 c  Molasses
      1    Egg
      2 c  Flour
      2 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Cloves
    1/2 ts Ginger
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Put the vegetable oil, sugar, molasses and egg into a mixing bowl and
  using a spoon, beat until well mixed.
  
  Combine the flour, baking soda, cloves, ginger, cinnamon and salt in
  a bowl and stir with a fork until well mixed.
  
  Add to the liquid ingredients and stir until blended.
  
  To make 2 1/2-inch round cookies use 1 tablespoon of dough per cookie
  (I use a 1-tablespoon ice cream scoop, but you can roll the dough into
  1-tablespoon-size balls by hand if you don't have a scoop.) Drop the
  dough 2-inches apart on a greased cookie sheet. Pat each rounded ball
  down just a trifle.
  
  Bake for 10 or 11 minutes.
  
  Yields 48 cookies

 Categories: Lamb, Syria, Lebanon, Holiday
      Yield: 1 Servings

  1 1/4 lb Lamb; cubed
           ;salt & pepper to taste
      2 c  Water

MMMMM-----------------------YOGHURT SAUCE----------------------------
      1 tb Olive oil
    1/4    Onion; minced
      1    Clove garlic; minced
      1 c  Water
      2 tb Cornstarch
      3 c  Low-fat yoghurt
      1 c  Chickpeas, cooked; optional
           Salt
           Fresh mint or cilantro,
           -minced
 
  "This particular lamb dish, cooked in a rich yoghurt sauce and served
  with rice or burghol, is a Ramadan favorite. During the Muslim month
  of daytime fasting, yoghurt is thought to "cool" a thirsty stomach
  and is consumed in every possible delicious manner: in salads and
  soups, as sauces for meat-filled pasta and meatballs, and as an
  ever-present accompaniment to the main dish."
  
  1. Lightly saute the lamb in 2 tablespoons olive oil, sprinkling with
  salt and pepper. Add 2 cups water and salt and bring to a boil. Cover
  and simmer for 2 hours, skimming the foam. The liquid with reduce
  considerably.
  
  2. For the sauce, saute the onion in the remaining 1 tablespoon olive
  oil until soft and transparent. Add the garlic and cook for another
  minute.
  
  3. Add 1 cup water to the onion and immediately whisk in the
  cornstarch, stirring until it is dissolved completely. Beat in the
  yoghurt, whisking in one direction only. Slowly bring the yoghurt
  sauce to a boil as you continue to stir. Remove from the heat.
  
  4. Pour the meat, the cooking liquid that remains, and the optional
  chickpeas into the yoghurt and gently return to a boil. Simmer for 2
  or 3 minutes to blend flavors. Taste and adjust seasoning.
  
  5. Serve over Vermicelli Rice or Vegetarian Wheat Pilaf, generously
  garnishing with mint or cilantro.
  
  Variation: Saute the mint and garlic in a bit of olive oil and
  drizzle over the cooked dish.

 Categories: Side dishes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Green peppers; depending on
      2    Onions
      8 sm Tomatoes
           Butter; or olive oil
           Salt and black pepper
      6    Eggs
 
  Recipe by: "Mirjam Dorn (JPW)" <yoel@BRACHOT.JCT.AC.IL> Cut the
  peppers open and remove the cores and seeds. Cut them into strips.
  Slice the onions and cut the tomatoes in half.
  
  Fry the onions and peppers in butter or oil in a large frying pan.
  Season to taste with salt and pepper, and let them stew gently in
  their own juices.  When the peppers are soft, add the halved tomatoes
  and continue cooking until they, too, are soft.  Taste the mixture,
  adding more seasoning if necessary.  Drop the eggs in whole, and cook
  until set. Season again if necessary, and serve.
  
  In some versions, the eggs are not left whole but are stirred and
  blended with the vegetables to achieve a creamy texture.
  
  NOTES:
  
  My usual recipe (although I really prefer eating it out when I'm at
  the open-air market) comes from Claudia Roden's book -- _A Book of
  Middle Eastern Food_. She says:
  
  "This is a dish of Tunisian origin which today is eaten in most Middle
  Eastern countries."

  Last night I made Shanghai Dumplings and thought of you when I opened
  the package of wrappers.  It had a real simple recipe that sounded
  good. Slice a banana into about fifteen pieces, wrap each piece in a
  won-ton or potsticker skin, deep fry it until golden, cool and then
  dust with powdered sugar.

      Title: SHANGHAI DUMPLINGS - CHOWZA
 Categories: Chinese, Pork, Tested, Mine
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------WRAPPER-------------------------------
      2 c  Flour
    1/4 c  Water; more or less; hot

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 lb Ground pork
    1/2 ts Chinese 5 spice
      1 ea Scallion; chopped
      1 ts Light soy sauce
    1/2 ts Ground black pepper
    1/4 ts Szechuan peppercorns;
           - toasted and crushed
 
  A very simple and filling Shanghai staple.
  
  Put flour in a food processer. Gradually add water (your mileage may
  vary) while mixing until the dough forms into a ball. Roll out on a
  floured surface to about 1/16" thick. Use a glass to cut into 3"
  circles. Set wrappers aside.
  
  Mix filling ingredients.
  
  To assemble, put a wrapper in the palm of your hand. Place about 1
  tablespoon of the filling in the wrapper and fold in half. Keep 1/4"
  of the wrapper free of stuffing for a good seal. Moisten edge with
  water. Crimp the edges together using your first 2 fingers and thumb,
  fluting the edges. Go around in one direction, flip over, then
  reverse. The idea is to seal them good! Cool in the 'fridge for at
  least an hour.
  
  Steam for 20 minutes; let cool.
  
  Deep fry until golden brown. Serve hot.
  
  Variations/notes: * Place each dumpling on a small piece of cabbage or
  lettuce to
    prevent sticking to the steamer rack. * Try boned pork steaks, fat
  removed, ground in a food processor. * Also try shrimp, chicken, or a
  combo of all. * Hot peppers, or pepper sauce, may be added to the
  filling. * The steam/cool/fry technique is the only way it matches
  the real
    thing! But these are also good just steamed.  I usually do them
  mixed.
  
  Sauces: Chopped garlic and light soy sauce
  :       Coleman's Dry Mustard mixed with cold water or light soy sauce
  :       Sesame oil, toasted sesame seeds, and dark soy sauce
  :       Hot pepper sauce of your choice
  
  Makes about 16 dumplings.
  
  Personal Note: When in Shanghai, I visited a restaurant that served
  only dumplings, on Nanjing Lu. They had =so= many variations of
  fillings and sauces; it was incredible. When I asked how the wrappers
  were made, I was told just mix flour and water, nothing else.

 Categories: Chinese, Chicken
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  3 1/2 lb (approximately) whole frying
           -chicken
    1/2 c  Dark soy sauce
  1 1/2 c  Peanut (or vegetable) oil
           -for braising
      2 tb Peanut oil for stewing
      4    Green onions
    1/2 ts Minced fresh ginger
      4 c  Water
    1/2 c  Medium sherry
    1/2 c  Thin soy sauce
      1    Clove star anise
      1 ts Salt
      3    Lumps rock sugar
      1 tb Sesame oil
           Cornstarch paste
 
  Red-cooking is a form of stewing with a seasoned liquid containing soy
  sauce and spices.
  
  If serving more people, get more chickens. Chickens should not exceed
  about 4 lbs. each.
  
  Marinating:  Wash chicken thoroughly under cool water: dry. Cut off
  fat pockets around cavity opening. Place chicken in snug bowl.Brush
  or rub dark soy sauce into skin; let stand in bowl for 30 minutes;
  repeat brushing several times.  Remove from bowl.
  
  Braising:  In wok heat oil for braising under medium high flame.When
  oil is hot, but not smoking, quickly lower chicken into oil. Protect
  yourself against splattering oil by holding wok lid over wok; don't
  actually cover it.  Using large spoon, baste chicken with hot oil, &
  turn once or twice so skin browns evenly (about 10-15 minutes).
  Carefully remove chicken from wok, trying not to break skin.
  
  Stewing:  Chop green onions into 2" sections.  Heat peanut oil in
  heavy pot or dutch oven, in which chicken will fit snugly. When oil
  is hot, add green onions & ginger.  Saute until onions are lightly
  brown. Add water, sherry, thin soy, star anise & salt. Bring mixture
  to boil.While liquid is heating, loosely tie legs of chicken together
  with a piece of twine. Lower chicken into boiling liquid.
  
  Bring liquid to boil again, then reduce heat for very slow simmer.
  Chicken should actually be floating free in liquid. Cover & simmer
  for about 1 hour or until chicken is very tender. Leave chicken in
  covered pot until 5 minutes before serving.  Then remove it carefully
  to serving platter; remove twine.  Remove all but 1 cup of liquid
  from pot (including onion pieces). Bring liquid to boil; thicken
  slightly with cornstarch paste; glaze with sesame oil. Pour sauce
  over chicken & serve.

  Don't be deceived by the simplicity of this recipe. It's one of the
  very best sweet and sour rib recipes I've run across as well as being
  one of the easiest. The taste of the ribs shines through rather than
  being overwhelmed as it often is with more complex sweet and sour
  recipes.
  
  Combine and sugar and water in a 2-quart stainless steel saucepan and
  bring to a boil over moderate heat, stirring until the sugar
  dissolves. Increase the heat to high and cook briskly, uncovered, for
  5 minutes or until the syrup reaches 200F on a candy thermometer.
  Reduce the heat to low, stir in the soy sauce, molasses, galangal,
  cilantro, and pepper, and simmer for 3 minutes.  Remove from the
  heat; let cool.
  
  Strain the sauce through a fine sieve set over a bowl. Sauce will
  keep at room temperature for 2 to 3 months if tightly covered.

      Title: SHARBAT BADAM (ALMOND SHARBAT)
 Categories: Beverages, Indian
      Yield: 1 Bottle
 
      2 oz Almonds; shelled
      2 oz Melon, cucumber, or pumpkin
           -seeds
      8    Green cardamoms (illaichi)
    1/4 ts Almond essence
  1 1/2 lb Sugar; yes, 1 1/2 pounds!
  1 1/4 pt Water; divided use
      1 tb Ruh kewra or 4 drops of
           -kewra essence
      3 sm Potassium metabisulphite
           -granules (do not use in xs)
 
  NOTES:
        2    ounces is about 57 grams.
  
  You can leave out melon seeds and double the quantity of almonds.
  
  Potassium metabisulphite is a chemical preservative. This recipe
  doesn't mention refrigeration as a means of storing this syrup; a
  western adaptation would be to leave out the chemical and store the
  syrup in the refrigerator.
  
  While neither this recipe nor the cookbook mentions diluting this, I
  assume this is a syrup concentrate meant to be diluted before
  serving. The cookbook says the recipe yields "1 bottle."
  
  "Almonds mixed with kernels of melon seeds is an age-old Indian
  drink. In addition to being a refreshing drink it is considered
  highly useful in improving intellectual capacity. The conventional
  method consists in grinding the ingredients and preparing the
  sharbat, which has to be made fresh every day just before it is to be
  served. The method described below however eliminates this tiresome
  procedure and enables one to prepare and store the sharbat."
  
  Soak the almonds and seeds overnight in cold water sufficient to cover
  them. Peel the skins and grind (use a stone slab or a mortar and
  pestle that does not smell of spices) into a smooth paste whilst
  adding 4 ounces of water every now and then. Strain the paste through
  muslin. Reserve juice.
  
  Grind the leftover paste with 3 ounces water, strain and repeat this
  process a second time. Add this juice to reserved juice.
  
  Then grind the leftover pulp using 3/4 pint water. Strain; mix in
  sugar, stir and cook on slow fire til the syrup thickens to one-thread
  consistency.
  
  Add 1/2 pint of the reserved juice and the extract of the cardamoms
  prepared by grinding them along with their skins and a little water.
  Simmer and remove the scum over the boiling syrup. Boil for a minute
  or two; remove from the fire. Strain through muslin and cool.
  
  Add ruh kewra or essence, the almond essence and potassium
  metabisulphite dissolved in a small quantity of syrup. Pour into
  sterilised bottles and cork with cleaned and boiled tops and seal
  with paraffin wax.

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
      1 tb Shredded Chinese cured ham
 
  * (note: there is no suitable substitute for shark's fin)
  
  This is some serious food++as most of these recipes are. They are the
  creations of one of the most intense culinary environments in the
  world and the competition is fierce. I've never seen the Bamboo
  Fungus called for in this soup in any of the Asian markets I've been
  in and preparing a Shark's Fin is not for the impatient.
  
  Establishment: Bui Hang Village Restaurant (Hotel Miramar) UG/F.,
  Princess Wing, Hotel Miramar, 130 Nathan Road, Tsimshatsui, Kowloon.
  
  Chinese Cuisine Practical Class Platinum Award - Shark's Fin "Gossamer
  curtains veiling exquisite feminine shadows" would be a justifiably
  poetical translation for the mood-setting name of this dish. The
  bamboo fungus, a deluxe vegetarian ingredient with almost mystical
  connotations, is envisaged as a curtain of delicate fibres, through
  which the beguilingly beautiful forms of the superlative shark's fin
  can be glimpsed. Red Mayflowers (denoted by the crab roe) are
  "embroidered" on the curtains, adding a third level of appetizing
  connotations.
  
  To prepare 1. Soak, shark's fin for 4 hours in cold water, and then
  simmer over medium heat for 10 hours. 2. Clean bamboo fungi and soak
  in cold water for 3 to 4 hours. 3. Steam-clean crab claws for
  approximately 3 minutes on plate on wok stand above boiling water. 4.
  Make shrimp paste by mixing shrimp meat with cornstarch and pinch of
  salt.
  
  To cook 1. Mix simmering ingredients with water (sufficient to cover
  fin) and bring to the boil.  Add cooled shark's fin and boil for 5
  minutes. Dram well and stuff inside bamboo fungi. 2. Arrange stuffed
  fungi on a deep plate.  Mix 1 cup of stock and 1/4 tsp of salt and
  pour over fungi. Cover and steam for 15 minutes. 3. Coat each claw
  with 10 g of shrimp paste, garish with a sprig of coriander, place in
  a deep plate, cover and steam for 3 minutes. 4. Add 1 cup oil to
  heated wok, then add asparagus and saute for 30 seconds. Drain and
  place asparagus in 3 cups of salted water and simmer until just
  cooked. Drain and refresh with cold water. 5. Stir-fry bean sprouts
  in a heated wok with 1 tbs oil, 1/2 tsp salt and ginger juice until
  half-cooked, but still crunchy.  Remove from wok. 6. To make crab roe
  sauce, add water, cornstarch and salt to stock. Over a high flame,
  bring to the boil. Add crab roe and bring to the boil again (at which
  point presentation platter should be ready for this sauce).
  
  To present 1. Arrange stuffed bamboo fungi like spokes of a wheel,
  pointing inwards on serving dish.  Lay asparagus and crab claws
  between them. 2. Pour freshly boiled crab roe sauce over dish. Pile
  bean sprouts in centre, top with shredded ham.

      Title: SHARON'S BREAD PUDDING WITH CUSTARD SAUCE
 Categories: Inn recipes, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6    Eggs
  2 1/2 c  Sugar
      1 tb Cinnamon
      1 tb Nutmeg
      1 tb Vanilla
    1/2 c  Melted butter
      3 c  Milk
      1 c  Evaporated milk
      1    French bread loaf
           Torn into 1-inch pieces
      1 c  Chopped pecans
      1 c  Raisins; (optional)
           Sauce:
      4 lg Eggs
      4 lg Egg yolks
      1 c  Sugar
      2 tb Cornstarch
      2 c  Milk
      1 c  Evaporated milk
      2 ts Vanilla
      2 tb Dark rum or amaretto
 
  Whip eggs until foamy. Add sugar, spices, vanilla, and melted butter;
  mix well. Add milk and torn pieces of French bread. Mix until all
  bread is saturated. Add pecans and raisins, if using. Pour into
  greased 9 x 13 inch pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. While
  bread is in oven, make custard sauce. Beat eggs and egg yolks
  together until light and creamy. Beat in sugar, cornstarch, milk and
  evaporated milk. Microwave at high for 2 minutes. Whip with wire
  whisk. Continue cooking at high until mixture is very thick, stirring
  with wire whisk every 30 to 60 seconds. (If you overcook, custard
  will have unsightly little bumps, blend in food processor or blender
  until smooth.)Remove from microwave and whisk in vanilla and amaretto
  or rum. Spoon over hot bread mixture in attractive bowls or glasses.
  Serve warm. If making ahead, refrigerate both bread and custard.
  Re-warm both in microwave.JM. Victorian Oaks Bed & Breakfast Minonk,

      Title: SHARON'S BUTTERMILK CURRANT SCONES
 Categories: Desserts, Biscuits
      Yield: 16 Scones
 
      3 c  Flour
      1 c  Buttermilk
    1/3 c  Sugar, plus
      2 tb Sugar
    3/4 c  Currants
      1 ts Grated orange rind,
           -orange part, or zest, only
  2 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    3/4 ts Salt
      1 tb Heavy cream
    3/4 c  Butter
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
 
  These scones have a fine, dense crumb with a little orange and
  cinnamon - a delicious combination of texture and flavour.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400F.
  
  Use an ungreased baking sheet.
  
  Combine the flour, 1/3 cup of the sugar, baking powder, baking soda,
  and salt in a mixing bowl. Stir with a fork to mix well and aerate.
  Cut the butter into the flour mixture, using a pastry blender or two
  knives or working with your fingertips, until the mixture looks like
  fresh crumbs. Add the buttermilk, currants, and orange rind. Mix only
  until the dry ingredients are moistened.
  
  Gather the dough into a ball and press so it holds together. Turn the
  dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead lightly twelve times.
  Divide the dough in two and pat each half into a circle 1/2 to 3/4
  inch thick.
  
  In a small bowl combine the cream, cinnamon, and remaining 2 tb sugar,
  stirring to blend. Brush the dough with this glaze.
  
  Cut each circle into eight scone shape pieces (circular, or wedge).
  Place the scones slightly apart on the baking sheet. Bake for about
  12-15 minutes, or until the tops are browned.
  
  Serve hot.

      Title: SHARON'S FAMOUS PASSOVER BROWNIES & BROWNIE I
 Categories: Bars, Publication, Jewish, Frostings, Passover
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2    Slightly beaten eggs
      1 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Cocoa powder
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Cooking oil
    1/2 c  Matzo cake meal
    1/2 c  Semisweet chocolate pieces
    1/2 c  Coarsely chopped nuts (opt)
           -Dark Chocolate Glaze (opt)
 
  In mixing bowl, beat eggs, sugar, cocoa powder and salt.
  
  Add oil to mixing bowl and blend well. Stir in the matzo cake meal and
  chocolate pieces. Stir in nuts, if desired.
  
  Line an 8x8x2" baking pan with foil. Grease lightly. Turn batter into
  prepared pan and spread evenly.
  
  Bake at 325-F for 25 to 30 minutes or till done (top will be shiny and
  edges dry). Let cool in pan on wire rack.
  
  Meanwhile, prepare glaze if desired. Spread over cooled brownies.
  
  Dark Chocolate Glaze: In a small heavy saucepan or skillet, melt 1 cup
  semisweet chocolate pieces over low heat. Remove from heat and stir
  in 1 tsp butter or margarine. In a small bowl, dissolve 1/2 tsp
  instant coffee crystals in 1 Tbsp hot water. Stir in 3 Tbsp dairy
  sour cream and 1/4 tsp maple flavoring. Add sour cream mixture to
  chocolate, stirring till smooth and shiny. Makes about 3/4 cup.
  
  Note: For a regular brownie, you can substitute 3/4 cup all purpose
  flour for the matzo cake meal and add 1 tsp vanilla. Also, you can
  double the recipe. Use a 13x9x2" baking pan and bake batter for about
  30 minutes.
  
  Brownie Ice Cream Pie: Prepare brownie batter as directed. Line a 9"
  pie plate with foil and grease lightly. Turn batter into pie plate.
  Bake at 325-F for 30 minutes. Remove from oven. Using the back of a
  wooden spoon dipped in cocoa powder, press hot brownies down, then
  gradually outward and evenly up the sides of pie plate. Cool, then
  freeze till firm.
  
  Make Dark Chocolate Glaze while crust is freezing; cool glaze to room
  temperature. Lift shell from plate; remove foil. Fill with 1/2 gal of
  slightly softened ice cream or frozen yogurt, adding a middle layer
  of the glaze and more chopped nuts. (If you'd like a smaller pie, use
  1 qt of ice cream in the crust, then top with glaze and chopped
  nuts.) Sharon Winstein and her friend Louise Levitt created these
  flour-free brownies for their first temple cooking class. For a
  twist, make the Brownie Ice Cream Pie.

 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 c  Chopped onion
      2    Garlic cloves, finely
           -chopped
      6    Bacon slices
      1 c  Chopped celery
      1 c  Chopped carrots
      2 c  Beef stock
      1 c  Tomato juice
      1    (14oz) can kidney beans,
           -drained
      2 ts Basil
    1/2 ts Oregano
      1 c  Barley
      2 tb Chopped parsley
 
  salt and pepper to taste
  
  In a large saucepan, saute onions and garlic in vegetable oil. In a
  small frying pan, cook bacon, drain off fat and cut bacon into small
  pieces. (To save a step, I cut the bacon into bite size chunks first
  and then cook them in the same pot that the soup is going to be in.
  Gives it a bit more flavour. Just drain off excess fat.) To the
  saucepans,add bacon, celery, carrots, beef stock and tomato juice;
  cook until vegetables are just tender, about 10 minutes. Add the rest
  of the ingredients and cook until barley is tender, about 20-30
  minutes. Serves 6-8.

      Title: SHARON'S SUPER SALSA
 Categories: Sauces, Salsa
      Yield: 7 Servings
 
           Sharon Stevens
      2 ts Garlic powder
      3 cn Green chilis (4-5 oz size)
    1/2    Bottle pickled jalepano
           -peppers (not seeded, about
           -10-12 oz jar)
      5 lg Green peppers (large fist
           -size)
      5 lg Onions (large fist size)
     16 lg Tomatoes (large fist size)
      5 cn Tomato paste (5oz)
      1 c  Water
      1 ts Cayenne
      1 ts Salt
 
  Chop onions, tomatoes, and peppers to bite sized pieces. Chop jalepano
  peppers into small pieces. Chop chilis into small pieces. Mix the
  tomato paste and the water together to make thick sauce. Add the
  garlic, cayenne and salt to sauce and mix. Put all the peppers,
  onions,and tomatoes into a large oval roaster and slowly cook over
  low-med heat. Add the jalapeno's, chili's and sauce with spices in it
  and stir until thoroughly mixed. Continue cooking until everything is
  JUST heated. Spoon into sterilized quart sealers and process in
  boiling water bath for 20 minutes. Makes about 7 quarts.
  
  This makes a medium spicy salsa.  If hotter salsa is desired, adjust
  the cayenne and the jalapeno peppers accordingly. I have used this
  not only as a salsa, but also for spaghetti sauce. Just add some
  browned, ground meat and some oregano and basil! Voila, instant
  spaghetti sauce. This salsa won a ribbon in our Annual Fall Fair for
  me! It came in second.....

  In a blender, puree enough chili peppers to measure 1 cup. Puree the
  parsley and cilantro together; mix well with the pureed chili
  peppers. Add the garlic, seasonings and olive oil; blend well.

  months.
  
  Yield: 1 1/2 cups.
  
  The author writes: "Shatta...is less powerful than zhoug. Its bright
  red color adds a rich hue to sauces and salads and enhances its
  delicious taste.  Shatta is a pleasure."

  Drain all the beans and chop the vegetables.  Mix together and put
  into glass gallon jar. In medium saucepan, mix dressing ingredients
  together and then heat until sugar has dissolved. Pour over the beans
  and mix thoroughly. Let sit in fridge for at least 24 hours to blend

  Will keep in the fridge for weeks and weeks......
  
  **NOTE**  I find that I have to make 4 times the brine recipe in
  order to cover the beans in a one gallon jar.

    Mix ground beef and water until soupy.  Mix in other ingredients.
  Simmer, uncovered 3 hours.  Stir occasionally.
  
    Note: Top with grated Cheddar, onions, chili beans or use as sauce
  over noodles or spaghetti.
  
    The Cincinatti Chili is, would you believe, an alternative to
  spaghetti sauce.  It's mild and sweet (the cinnamon does that), and
  won't burn anyone's mouth unless you serve it boiling

  TIMESAVING FOOTNOTE: I am now a firm believer in buying the "Shredded
  Beef" at your supermarker butcher counter, which dispenses almost
  entirely with the chopping process. Another alternative is to find a
  butcher with a "chili plate" for a coarse grind.  Make sure you let
  it cook at least 3 hours --6 or 12 hours is even better. Submitted By

                                         Approx. Cook Time: 8:00 Soak
  the porcini in 1 cup water for 2 hours. Drain them, pat dry with
  paper towels, chop fine, and set aside. Discard the liquid or save
  for another use.
  
  To make the stock, in a large soup pot, bring the meat, bones, and
  water to a boil over high heat, periodically skimming off the foam as
  it rises to the top. Add the remaining stock ingredients, and reduce
  the heat to low. Simmer, covered, until the meat is tender; about two
  hours.
  
  Meanwhile, melt half the butter in a deep skillet over medium heat>
  Add the cabbage and sauerkraut and saut# for 10 minutes, tossing and
  stirring regularly.  Add one cup hot stock (it doesn't have to be
  fully cooked) and the tomato paste.  Cover and simmer over low heat
  for 35 to 40 minutes.
  
  Melt the remaining butter in another large skillet and saut# the
  carrot, onions, celery, turnip, and mushrooms until soft and lightly
  browned; about 15 minutes. When the stock is ready, strain it into a
  clean pot. Reserve the meat and discard the other solids. Add the
  sauerkraut and cabbage, the vegetable mixture, and tomatoes to the
  stock. Season with salt and pepper, stir, and cook, covered, over
  medium-low heat for 20 minutes.
  
  Cut the meat into bite-size pieces and add it to the soup, along with
  the minced garlic.  Simmer for another five minutes. Let stand for at
  least 15 minutes, and preferably a day and a night, before serving;
  refrigerate, covered, and reheat slowly if serving the next day.
  Serve garnished with fresh dill and sour cream, if desired.

      Title: SHEFTALIA (BARBEQUE SAUSAGES)
 Categories: Greek, Meats, Bar-b-q
      Yield: 50 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
    500 g  Finely ground fatty pork
    500 g  Finely ground veal or lamb
      1 lg Onion; finely chopped
           -or- grated
    1/2 c  Finely chopped parsley
      2 ts Salt
    250 g  Panna (caul fat from pig)
 
  Combine pork with veal or lamb, onion, parsley, salt and a generous
  grinding of black pepper. Dip panna into a bowl of warm water for a
  minute or two, remove and carefully open out a piece at a time,
  laying it out flat on work surface. Cut with kitchen scissors into
  pieces about 10 cm (4 inches) square. Take a good tablespoon of meat
  mixture and shape into a thick sausage about 5 cm (2 inches) long.
  Place towards one edge of piece of panna, fold end and sides over
  meat and roll up firmly. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Thread
  sausages on flat sword-like skewers, leaving space between them.
  Number on each skewer depends on their length. Cook over glowing
  charcoal, turning frequently. Do not place too close to heat as
  sheftalia must cook fairly slowly so that the inside is well cooked
  and the outside nicely browned without being burnt. The panna melts
  during cooking, keeping the meat moist and adding flavour. Excessive
  flaring of fire can be controlled by a sprinkle of water on the
  coals. Serve sheftalia as an appetizer or a main course.

  Last night I made soup.  My version of a type of minestrone. I got a
  package of Knorr Vegetable soup mix, put 8 cups of water and 1 can of
  low sodium beef broth, defatted, brought this to a boil, then added a
  sliced leek, 1/4 head of sliced cabbage, 1 stalk of sliced celery,
  some alfalfa sprouts, 2/3 cups each of barley and small shell
  macaroni, a little oregano, rosemary, sage and thyme and some pepper.
  Simmered it for about 2 hours.  It made the best, THICK, vegetable
  soup! I have a huge bowl in the freezer, and two big containers in
  the fridge for lunches this week.

           Green part included
  1 1/2 c  Diced or shredded, cooked or
           Canned shellfish meat shrimp
           Or crabmeat are good

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
    1/3 c  Dry white vermouth
      2 tb Cornstarch mixed w/2tb milk
  1 1/2 c  Heavy cream or half n half
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Swiss cheese, grated
           Dash of nutmeg - optional

MMMMM--------------------------ASSEMBLY-------------------------------
     12    Crepes 6 to 7in in diameter
    1/4 c  Swiss cheese grated
      2 tb Butter
           Creamed shellfish filling
           Wine and cheese sauce
 
  To make the Filling: Heat butter to bubbling, stir in the shallots or
  scallions, then the shellfish. Toss and stir for one minute. Season
  with salt and pepper; add vermouth and boil rapidly until liquid has
  almost evaporated. Set aside.
  
  To make the Sauce:  Heat vermouth and boil rapidly until reduced to a
  tablespoon. Remove from heat and stir in cornstarch mixture, cream and
  seasonings. Put back on heat and simmer for about 2 minutes stirring
  constatntly. Blend in the cheese and stir to blend about a minute
  more.
  
  To Assemble:  Blend about half the sauce with the shellfish filling.
  Place a big spoonful on the lower third of each crepe and roll up
  (you can tuck and roll like you would for blintzes) Arrange crepe
  close together in a lightly buttered baking dish. Spoon the rest of
  the sauce over the crepes and sprinkle with cheese. Dot with butter;
  may be refrigerated until ready to bake. Fifteen to twenty minutes
  before serving bake in upper third of a preheated 425F oven until
  bubbling hot and cheese has browned lightly.
  
  NOTES:  I have also added mushrooms to the filling but watch the water
  content, you may have to pour off some of the liquid before adding
  cheese sauce.
  
  I also add a dash or two of nutmeg to the cream sauce and use
  slightly more cheese than called for. You could also use Gruyere
  cheese.
  
  For individual servings bake them two to a serving in individual
  gratin dishes. This dish does not reheat well, unless of course it is
  just for you then there's no problem:)
  
  This recipe is from my mom who based it on a recipe of Julia Child a
  long time ago. Typos by Kim Reese.

      Title: SHELLFISH SHELL MARINARA
 Categories: Pasta, Seafood
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
      2 lg Garlic sloces, peeled and
           -bruised
      2 cn Plum tomatoes, drained and
           -coarsely chopped (28 oz)
    1/4 c  Dry red wine
    1/4 c  Coarsely chopped parsley
    1/4 c  Fresh basil leaves, torn in
           -half
      1 ts Dried oregano
           Salt to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
           -to taste
        pn Sugar
     12 oz Medium-sized shell pasta
     20    Littleneck clams
    1/2 lb Large shrimp, peeled and
           -deveined
 
  For company or a special family meal, there is nothing quite like
  littleneck clams and shrimp quickly cooked up in a robust marinara
  sauce. (No cheese is necessary with this sauce; flavoring the oil
  with garlic is the secret to its great taste.) The clams will take
  longer to open than the shrimp will take to cook, so add the shrimp
  at the last moment. Be sure to discard any clams that don't open -
  this could mean they are not safe to eat.
  
  1. Place oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-low heat. Add the
  garlic and cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until it colors slightly
  but does not burn. Remove garlic from heat and carefully stir in the
  tomatoes.
  
  2. Return the pot to medium heat. Add the wine, parsley, basil,
  oregano, salt, pepper and sugar. Cook sauce slowly, stirring
  occasionally, for 30 minutes.
  
  3. Slightly before serving, cook pasta in boiling, salted water for
  10-12 minutes or until AL DENTE (just tender).
  
  4. While pasta is cooking, add the clams to the sauce; cover and cook
  for 8 minutes or until the clams just begin to open, shaking the pot
  once or twice. Add shrimp and cook 5 minutes longer.
  
  5. Divide the cooked pasta among six shallow bowls. Spoon the hot
  sauce over the top, distributing the clams and shrimp evenly, and
  serve immediately.

 Categories: Meats, Beef
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           From: Gaye Levy ** DTXT63A
      2 lb Lean ground beef
      2 c  Fresh bread crumbs
    1/2 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Minced onion
      2    Carrots; shredded or chopped
      2    Eggs
    1/4 ts Pepper
      4 tb A1 sauce
 
  Preheat oven to 350. In a large bowl, mix all ingredients well. Spoon
  into a 9 x 5 loaf pan. Smooth top with a spoon. Bake 1 1/2 hours. For
  easier serving, let meatloaf stand at room temperature at least 5
  minutes before slicing.    This recipe can be varied a lot. For
  example, use cooked rice or oatmeal instead of the bread crumbs.
  Instead of the milk, use tomato sauce, 1 cup of cottage cheese or 1
  cup of stewed tomatoes . Naturally, various spices can be added.
  Notes from Gaye: Since I love meatloaf but hate mixing it up, I
  delegated the job to my husband Shelly. EVERYONE loves this meatloaf,
  including non-meat eaters (like me).

      1 ts Sesame oil
      1 ts Salt
 
  Ran across these three short recipes utilizing ginseng. Thought
  someone into herbs and/or Chinese medicinal cooking might find them
  interesting. Note the measurement for "a heaping tablespoon vegetable
  oil" in the last recipe.  Ginseng must be pretty miraculous stuff if
  you can heap tablespoons of oil...
  
  Put seasonings in a bowl and pour the boiling water into it. This is
  a good drinking soup that goes well with a heavy dinner.

 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4    To 5 Potatoes
      1    Onion, chopped.
      2 c  Lentils
    1/2 c  Or more tvp
      2    Or more cups frozen veggies
           {I use peas, corn, carrots,
           Beans}
      1 c  Nutritional yeast {I use
           Enjivata yeast as well}
      1 tb {or more} tamari sauce
    1/8 c  Oil*
    1/8    Water
      2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Flour
 
  TO PREPARE: Top layer: Boil spuds & mash** {with soymilk, nutritional
  yeast, parsley, minced garlic}. Set aside.
  
  Bottom layer: Cook up 2 cups of lentils in vegetable stock and chopped
  onion. When through add enough textured vegetable protein to absorb
  the excess water. Set aside.
  
  Prepare nutritional yeast gravy: Toast flour over medium heat, add
  yeast, then oil and mix well. Add water. Bring to a boil and use
  whisk to get rid of clumps. May want to add more yeast. Add tamari
  and gravy flavoring. Cook a few minutes until thickened.
  
  Add to lentil and tvp mixture reserving about 1/2 cup for the top.
  
  In a baking dish {I spray with pam}, spoon in lentil-tvp-gravy
  mixture, then put on frozen veggies, then spoon mashed potatoes over
  everything. Drizzle with remaining gravy and bake for about a 1/2
  hour or more in a 375 degree oven.

 Categories: Mexican, Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      5 lb Leg of lamb

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      3    To 4 dried chili pasillas or
      4 tb Chili powder
  1 1/2 c  Tepid water
      2    Cloves garlic
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      1 lg Onion, cut into chunks
      2    Pickled Serrano chilies, or
           -any small red or green hot
           -pepper
      2    Ounces dry grated cheese
      8 tb Tequila
  2 1/4 tb Salt
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
      1 tb Dry red wine
    1/2 tb Lime juice
 
  (Shepherd's Roast with Drunken Sauce]            )
  
  In Hidalgo, halves of mutton are hung over a wood fire and slowly
  turned until the meat is cooked and the outside is crisp and black.
  
  Toward the end of the cooking process, the roast is basted with
  lightly salted butter.  It's served with Salsa Borracha, below.
  
  FOR THE ROAST:
  
  Use a 5-pound leg of lamb and roast it on a spit over a charcoal fire
  until done the way you like it (1 1/2 to 2 hours). Baste from time to
  time with lightly salted butter in which a clove of garlic has been
  crushed and a pinch of dry mustard added.
  
  In an ungreased skillet, cook the dried chili pasillas for a few
  minutes, turning occasionally to prevent burning. Skip this step if
  chili powder is used. Remove stems and seeds and cover them with the
  water, saving the skins.  In about 3/4 hour, put the chilies in a
  blender with the remaining ingredients and 4 tablespoons of the water
  in which the chili seeds were soaked.  Blend all until smooth. Strain
  the remaining chile water and add to sauce.  Serve, either by pouring
  a little over each portion of meat, or letting guests help
  themselves. Add more chili powder or chilies for a hotter sauce.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

      Title: SHEREEN POLO I (ALMOND~ CARROT~ ORANGE PILAU)
 Categories: Candies, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------SUGAR SYRUP-----------------------------
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Whole saffron
    1/4 ts Ground cardamom
      2 tb Oil
      3 c  Carrots, julienned
    1/2 c  Dried orange peel slivers
           Water, boiling
    1/2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Almonds, blanched, slivered
      2 tb Rose water, or to taste
      3 tb Shelled pistachios

MMMMM----------------------RICE WITH TADIQ---------------------------
      2 c  Raw rice, well rinsed
      1 ts Salt
      4 c  Water, hot
      5 tb Oil
    1/4 ts Ground turmeric
      2 tb Water
 
   1.  Grind the 1/2 teaspoon of sugar and the whole saffron together,
  using a mortar and pestle, until they are quite fine. Add the
  cardamom and grind everything together smoothly.  Set aside. 2. Heat
  the oil in a pan, add the carrots, and stir-fry over low heat for
  about 6 minutes, stirring frequently to brown them slightly. Set
  aside in the pan. 3. Cover the orange peel with boiling water for 2
  minutes.  Drain and set aside. 4. Put the 1 cup of sugar and the 1/2
  cup of water in a pan and simmer over moderate heat for 2 minutes to
  dissolve the sugar. Add the almonds, cooked carrots, and orange peel
  and continue cooking for 2 minutes more. 5. Remove the melange from
  the heat and stir in the rose water, pistachios, and the saffron
  mixture.  Set aside. 6. To prepare the rice, cover it with cold water
  and salt; let it soak for 1/2 hour. Pour off nearly all the lightly
  salted water, leaving about 1/2 cup. Bring the 4 cups of water to a
  boil over moderate heat, and add the rice and remaining liquid. Cook
  for 8 minutes, drain, and rinse under cold water. Drain and set aside
  briefly. 7. Put 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large enough pan with
  the turmeric. Shake the pan briskly to mix.  Pour in the rice to
  cover the oil and shape the top into a pyramid. Cover the pan and
  cook over low heat for 10 minutes. 8. Uncover and sprinkle the
  remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and 2 tablespoons of water over the
  rice. Cover the pan with a cloth kitchen towel and the pan cover.
  Cook over very low heat for 1/2 hour to allow the rice crisp (tadiq)
  to form.  Some cooks let the tadiq form by cooking for 1 hour but the
  lesser time seems to work. Serve the rice on a platter, decorated
  around the top with pieces of tadiq, which must be scooped from the
  pan bottom.  The warm sugar syrup melange is served separately. Each
  diner spreads as much melange as he or she wants over the rice. Serve
  warm with the chicken stew (Albaloo Polo)

 Categories: 
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Allpurpose bleached flour
    1/2 ts Salt
     16 tb Cold unsalted butter -- (2
           Sticks)
    2/3 c  Sour cream
 
  Combine flour and salt in the work bowl of a food processor and pulse
  several times to mix. Cut butter into 15 to 20 pieces and add to work
  bowl. Pulse repeatedly, about 20 times in all, to reduce the mixture
  to a fine powder. Open the cover and check the consistency
  occasionally to avoid overprocessing and turning the mixture into a
  paste. Add sour cream to work bowl and pulse 5 or 6 times more, or
  until the dough forms a coherent ball. Don't overprocess. Remove
  dough from work bowl to a floured surface and press it into two 6inch
  disks. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate. Keep the dough in the
  refrigerator for up to two days, or doublewrap in plastic and freeze
  for up to several weeks. Yield: About 22 ounces of dough, enough for
  a 2crust pie

  Lentils were eaten long before Rome was founded; it is generally
  thought that the pottage for which Esau sold his birthright to Jacob
  (Genesis 25) was a stew of lentils. Sidney Taylor offers a better
  deal; you can have his recipe for lentils and keep your birthright.
  And we may assume that his lentil bisque is smoother. Jacob had no
  blender.
  
  =======================================================
  ============== ====
  
  In an 8-10 quart pan, combine broth, celery, carrots, chopped onions,
  bell pepper, zucchini, and lentils. Bring to a boil over high heat,
  then cover and simmer until lentils are very soft to bite, 50-55
  minutes.
  
  Whirl mixture, a portion at a time, in a blender or food processor
  until smooth. Return to pan and stir in dry sherry and cream sherry.
  (If made ahead, or if there are no leftovers, cover and chill up to 4
  days; or freeze in 2- or 3-serving portions.) Heat until steaming and
  ladle onto bowls. Add green onion, sour cream, and salt and pepper to
  taste.

      Title: SHETLAND SHORTBREAD
 Categories: None
      Yield: 12 Pieces, de
 
      8 oz Plain (all-purpose) flour
      2 oz Self raising flour
      3 oz Cornflour (cornstarch)
      3 oz Castor (superfine) sugar
      8 oz Butter or margarine, or a
           - half/half mixture is good
 
  Melt butter. Mix dry ingredients. Add and knead all together. Pat or
  roll into baking sheet (to about 1/2" deep). Prick over with fork.
  Sprinkle with sugar. Cut into 1" by 2-3" strips when taken from oven.
  Bake at 350F/160C/Gas Mark 4 on bottom shelf of oven until a pale
  beige colour (15- 25 minutes).
  
  I use castor sugar not granulated and a half butter half margarine
  mix to get the best results. I usually make double quantities, since
  it keeps well in an air-tight tin.
  
  Note that this does have a lighter feel than shortbreads from other
  parts of Scotland.

  squeeze it gently to rid it of its moisture.  With the back of a
  wooden spoon, rub it through a sieve set over a bowl. In another
  bowl, soak the shredded carrots in 1/4 c cold water & 1/2 ts of salt
  for about 30 minutes. Drain, squeeze dry & set aside. In a small pot
  heat 1 ts vegetable oil over high heat until a light haze forms above
  it.  Stir in the konnyaku, kashi, 1 ts of sugar, the remaining salt &
  1/8 ts soy sauce.  Bring to a boil & simmer, uncovered until the
  liquid has reduced by half.  Cool to room temperature. Heat a small
  frying pan over high heat until a drop of water flicked across its
  surface evaporates instantly. Add the sesame &, shaking the pan
  almost constantly, warm them until they are a pale gold & their aroma
  is released. Bring to a paste in a suribachi (serrated mixing bowl)
  or, more easily, pulverize them at high speed in an electric blender
  with 1/8 ts of soy sauce. Transfer the sesame seed paste to a mixing
  bowl & stir in the reserved tofu. Drain the konnyaku and its sauce
  through a sieve set over a small bowl. Stir 2 tbs of the sauce into
  the sesame seed paste.  Stir in 1 tb sugar, 1/4 ts salt, the drained
  konnyaku, & the reserved grated carrot. Serve as a first course or

  Shell, devein, wash, and drain prawns.  Dice into bits.
  
  Boil mushrooms in water for 10 minutes, rinse, squeeze dry, cut off
  and discard stems; then chop into very small pieces.
  
  Combine the pork, mushrooms, prawns, and onion.  Put mixture on
  chopping board and chop 10 to 15 strokes with cleaver. (Use a sharp
  knife if you don't have a cleaver.) Texture, when you're finished,
  should be slightly finer than hamburger.
  
  Add "seasoning" and the egg to the pork mixture.  Mix well.
  
  To make dumpling, place 1 Tb filling in the center of a dumpling
  skin. Then bring all sides of the skin up to cover the meat as much
  as possible, without closing. The top of the dumpling is left open.
  
  Cook dumplings by steaming for 30 minutes.  Use as many as you need,
  with the rest, cool, wrap, freeze. Reheat after thawing by steaming
  10 minutes.
  
  Serve with soy sauce, hot sauce, or mustard.
  
  *  Dumpling skins are similar to won ton skins, except that they are
  round and slightly thinner.  You may substitute won ton skins by
  merely cutting off the corners to round off the skin.

      Title: SHIU NG HEUNG GAI (OVEN ROASTED SPICED CHICKE
 Categories: Chinese, Chicken
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 kg (3 lb) chicken pieces
    1/3 c  Light soy sauce
    1/4 c  Peanut oil
      1 tb Chinese wine or dry sherry
      1    Clove garlic
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Finely grated fresh ginger
      2 ts Five spice powder
 
  The following two recipes come from Charmaine Solomon's THE COMPLETE
  ASIAN COOKBOOK.  I haven't tried either yet but plan to once we
  finish remodeling our kitchen.
  
  This method of preparation is particularly suited for chicken
  drumsticks, thighs or wings.  If it is not possible to buy selected
  joints, a whole chicken can be used. See variation at end of recipe.
  
  Oven temperature: 350 to 375 degrees Cooking Time: 45 minutes to 1
  hour
  
  Wash chicken pieces, dry well on paper towels.  In a large shallow
  dish mix soy sauce, oil and wine.  Crush garlic to a pulp with salt
  and add to soy mixture with ginger and five spice. Mix well. Put
  chicken joints in marinade and turn to coat all sides.  Cover and
  marinate for 1 hour or more.
  
  Remove chicken from the marinade, put in a roasting pan in one layer
  and spoon about 2 Tb of the marinade over. Roast in a moderate oven
  for 45 minutes to 1 hour or until chicken is brown and crisp, basting
  every 20 minutes with the marinade.  Serve hot or cold.
  
  Wings need about 45 minutes roasting time, drumsticks from 45-55
  minutes and thighs 1 hour.  Thighs should be roasted skin side
  uppermost.
  
  Variation:
  
  Make a marinade as above and rub it well all over a 3 1/2 lb roasting
  chicken.  Spoon some of the marinade into the cavity of the chicken as
  well.  Marinate for 1 hour, then roast as above, turning the chicken
  first on one side and then on the other so it is browned all over.
  Baste frequently. Finish cooking chicken breast upwards. It should
  take about 1 hour 45 minutes.  To serve, carve chicken as for
  red-cooked chicken.

      Title: SHOO-FLY COOKIES
 Categories: Cookies, Amish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Molasses
    1/4 c  Light corn syrup
      1 pn Of Salt
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 c  Boiling water
           Crumb Topping:
    3/4 c  Butter, softened
      1 c  Brown sugar
  1 1/2 c  All purpose flour
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
 
  Pastry for a 2 crust 9 inch pie
  
  Shoo-fly pies are not made here (Indiana) as commonly as in
  Pennsylvania. However, this cookie recipe is a wonderful substitute.
  It is like a tender gingerbread in a pastry crust, with a thin,
  subtle layer of molasses pudding on th bottom.
  
  Line a 2 quart rectangular glass baking dish with pastry, crimping the
  dough well at the top and over the sides--you do not want it to slip
  during baking. With a food processor or mixer, combine the crumb
  ingredients; reserve.  Preheat the oven to 325 F.  In a medium bowl,
  combine the molasses, corn syrup, salt, baking soda, and boiling
  water. Pour 1/2 cup of the liquid into the pie shell and sprinkle
  with one-third of the crumb mixture.  Repeat twice, ending with
  crumbs. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes. Watch carefully in the beginning,
  and if crust begins to slip down, pat it back up with a knife.  The
  top will be golden.  Let cool and cut into 1-1/2 inch squares. NOTE:
  If you really like molasses, use less corn syrup and increase the
  molasses.

      Title: SHORT RIBS BRAISED IN RED WINE *JB
 Categories: None
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6    Short ribs (about 6 pounds)
      2 tb Coarse salt
    1/2 ts Fresh-ground black pepper
      1 tb Olive oil
      1    Onion, chopped
      1    Carrot, chopped
      1    Rib celery, chopped
  1 1/4 c  Water
      2 c  Red wine
 
  1. Trim any excess fat from the ribs. Sprinkle each rib on all sides,
  except the bone-side, with 1 teaspoon of the salt. Put the ribs on a
  rack atop a baking sheet to catch any drips. Cover with plastic wrap
  and refrigerate for at least 8 hours.
  
  2. Heat the oven to 325 B0. Dry the ribs with paper towels and then
  sprinkle them with the ground pepper. In a large pot, heat the oil
  over moderately high heat. Add three of the ribs and brown them well
  on all sides, about 8 minutes. Remove the ribs. Brown the remaining
  ribs and remove them from the pot.
  
  3. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the pot. Reduce the heat
  to moderately low. Add the onion, carrot and celery and cook, stirring
  occasionally, until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the
  water and simmer 2 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pot to
  dislodge any brown bits.
  
  4. Transfer the vegetables and liquid to a roasting pan. Arrange the
  ribs, side by side, on top of the vegetables and add any accumulated
  juice. Pour the wine over the ribs. Cover tightly with aluminum foil
  and cook in the oven until tender but not falling off the bone, about
  2 hours and 20 minutes.
  
  5. Remove the ribs and keep warm. Pour off most of the fat from the
  roasting pan. Strain the braising liquid into a medium saucepan and
  press the vegetables to get all the liquid. Discard the vegetables.
  Bring to a boil over moderately high heat and continue boiling until
  the liquid is reduced to 2-1/2 cups, about 5 minutes. Serve the ribs
  with the jus poured over them.

      Title: SHORTBREAD CRUST
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Unbleached Flour; Sifted
           Sugar; Granulated, *
      1    Egg; Large, Separated, **
    1/2 c  Butter; Softened, ***
 
  *     Use from 1/4 to 1/3 cup of granulated sugar. (To Taste.) **
  Separate the large egg and lightly beat the yolk. *** Use only sweet
  cream, unsalted butter in this recipe. NO MARGARINE.
  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
   Working on a large flat surface, such as a pastry board, place the
  flour and the sugar in the center of the surface and mix together.
  Form a small depression or well in the center of the mound. Add the
  beaten egg yolk and the softened butter to the well, ten blend these
  with the dry mixture. Mix the ingredients thoroughly using your hands
  ~- there's no substitute for warm hands. Shape the dough into a ball
  and wrap in plastic wrap. Chill for at least 10 minutes.  Roll out
  the dough to a thickness of about 1/4-inch. You should have a circle
  of about 11 inches in diameter.
   For best results, roll out your dough between 2 sheets of waxed
  paper, then peel away the paper and cut the crust in a 9-inch circle.
  Place the circle inside a 9-inch springform pan. Prick the crust
  several times with a fork to keep the crust from puffing up during
  the baking. Place the springform pan in the oven and bake for 15 to
  20 minutes, or until light brown.  Allow to cool.  Using the leftover
  dough, line the sides of the springform pan. Press the dough against
  the sides of the pan, smoothing it so as to have a continuous layer
  of crust all the way around the sides of the pan.  Make sure that the
  side crust meets the bottom crust all the way around.  Brush the
  reserved egg white onto the shell, covering the bottom and sides.
  This will seal the dough and keep it from becoming soggy. Set aside
  until ready to use. NOTE: For the Italian Cheesecake, add 1 ts of
  grated lemon rind and 1 ts of Amaretto Liqueur when adding the egg
  yolk and butter.

    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Condensed milk
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
  3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Cornstarch
 
  COMBINE BUTTER, sugar and salt in an electric mixer fitted with a
  paddle, if you have one, and beat at medium speed until creamy. Add
  condensed milk and vanilla and beat until incorporated. Reduce speed
  to slow and slowly add the flour and then the cornstarch. Beat until
  incorporated. Divide the dough unto 4 balls, wrap in plastic wrap and
  chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour, or until firm. Lightly flour a
  work surface and roll out the dough to a 1/4-inch thickness. Keep
  lifting the dough and, if it sticks to the surface, sprinkle with a
  little more flour. Preheat oven to 300F. Using a 2 1/2-inch round
  cookie cutter, cut out circles of dough, or use a knife to cut dough
  into 2-inch squares. Place on a non-stick or lightly buttered cookie
  sheet, and replace in the refrigerator to chill, about 15 minutes.
  Place rack in the middle of the oven. Place cookies in the oven for
  15 to 20 minutes. The cookies should color only slightly. Cool

      Title: SHOULDER OF VEAL BRAISED IN WHITE WINE~ SAGE
 Categories: Italian, Veal, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  This series was inspired by a current plenitude of cheap veal down
  under. The column advised buying the small carcasses that were
  selling for $2.50 to $3.00 (Oz dollars...) as a way to save money.
  
  Raw Materials would like to be able to tell you the prove- nance of
  this recipe but, since we have been cooking it for more years than we
  care to remember and. in any case. modified it way back when, to get
  rid of the fat, its origins are lost in the mists of time. Given the
  ingredients, it probably originated in Italy or France. Don't worry
  about the amount of garlic. The long slow cooking tames it completely.
  
  Into a saucepan or pot large enough to take the veal should- er (if
  necessary, cut into the joint between the shoulder blade and foreleg
  so that it bends more), put 2 or 3 stems of fresh sage or about 2
  teaspoons of dried, about 10 peeled cloves of garlic, halved if they
  are large, and about 2 cups of dry white wine. Put in the shoulder of
  veal, cover the pot and simmer very slowly for 2-2.5 hours. If you
  wish, you can add thick slices of potato about three quarters of an
  hour before the end of cooking.
  
  Remove the veal, potatoes and garlic cloves to a hot serving dish and
  carve the veal into thick slices. Remove and discard the sage from
  the cooking liquid, taste it and correct the seasoning, then boil the
  liquid fiercely for a couple of minutes to reduce it. Pour over the
  veal and potatoes and serve. This liquid will set to a clear,
  flavourful aspic, so if you have any veal left over (unlikely),
  refrigerate the liquid till it is just beginning to gel, then spoon
  several layers of it over the veal. This leaves you with a delicious
  cold dish for the next day.
  
  Serves 3 or 4.

      Title: SHOYU CHICKEN
 Categories: Chicken, Hawaiian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      5 lb Chicken pieces
      1 c  Low-sodium soy sauce
      6 tb Brown sugar
      1    Whole dried star anise
      2 ts Fresh ginger root, crushed
      1 tb Dry sherry
           Chinese parsley (cilantro)
           Green onions, chopped
           (scallions) *
 
  *  Both ingredients are optional.
  
  In a large pan, place chicken with soy sauce, brown sugar, star anise,
  ginger, sherry, and 1/2 cup water. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer
  over a low flame, stirring occasionally to make sure that the chicken
  pieces are all evenly exposed to the seasoning sauce.
  
  If you use the Chinese parsley, cook a few stalks with the chicken.
  Otherwise, use the green onions (scallions) fresh as a garnish.
  
  If you want, you can thicken the sauce with cornstarch by removing a
  tablespoon of the cooking liquid to a small bowl and stirring in
  about 1 teaspoon cornstarch, mixing well to dissolve. Add the mixture
  to the cooking liquid after the chicken has been removed and stir
  over medium heat until the sauce thickens. Pour over the chicken
  before serving.
  
  Makes 4 to 6 servings.

  the egg white, salt and cornstarch. Chill for about 20 minutes. Heat
  the oil in a wok or large skillet until moderately hot. Add the
  chicken mixture and stir-fry it quickly in the oil to keep it from
  sticking. Cook until it turns white, which should take about 1
  minute. Drain the chicken immediately in a colander or sieve and
  drain off the oil. Clean the wok and add about 1 tablespoon of the
  drained oil. Reheat until it is hot. Add the sesame seeds and
  stir-fry them for 1 minute or until slightly brown. Add the sauce
  ingredients and bring to a boil. Return the cooked chicken to the pan
  and stir-fry the mixture for another 2 minutes, coating the pieces
  thoroughly with the sauce and sesame seeds. Serve at once, or let
  cool and serve at room temperature.

      Title: SHREDDED MEAT TAMALES
 Categories: Misc, Mexican
      Yield: 32 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------------MASA---------------------------------
     32    Corn shucks
      1 c  Lard
      1 ts Chili powder
      1 ts Salt
      8 c  Masa
      3 c  Water, warm

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 md Onions, chopped
      1    Garlic cloves, crushed
    1/2 ts Cumin, ground
    1/2 ts Chili powder
    1/2 tb Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper, black
      3 tb Raisins; finely chopped
      2 tb Oil
      1 lb Meat, shredded
    1/4 c  Water

MMMMM-----------------------COOKING WATER----------------------------
    1/2 tb Lard
      1 ts Chili powder
      1 pt Water
 
  Soak corn shucks in warm water 2 hours or overnight before using.
  
  Fry onion, garlic, cumin, chili powder, salt, pepper, and raisins (if
  desired) in hot oil.  Add meat and water and simmer until liquid has
  been absorbed.
  
  Work lard, chili powder, and salt into masa; knead with hands until
  smooth. (Alternately, pour ingredients into breadmaker and start on
  "manual.") Using back of spoon, spread masa mixture thinly and evenly
  on inside of shuck, covering half the length of shuck.
  
  Thinly spread 1 tb filling mixture on masa-covered portion of shuck.
  Lap one side of shuck over the other, folding under portion of shuck
  which does not contain masa.
  
  Stack tamales, pyramid-fashion, on shallow steaming rack in bottom of
  large cooker.  Add lard and chili powder to water and pour over
  tamales. Cover with additional shucks and steam 4-5 hours. Hint: when
  masa is done, it will pull away from shucks when unfolded.
  
  Sylvia's notes: Stokes' Green Chili Sauce with Pork, along with some
  shredded meat, makes a great quick filling. And I steamed a batch in
  my rice cooker/steamer, for 4 hours, although I think they were done
  after 3. It was a bit of a pain because when the timer dinged at the
  end of an hour, I had to remove the steamer and drip pan and refill
  the water base before starting it for another hour, but it was still
  less of a hassle than trying to keep them from burning in a big pot.
  I also had to clean the base pretty well, as something colored from
  the tamales kept working down into the water.  And I think the masa
  needs a lot more chili powder to steam it over plain water instead of
  flavored water; it was pretty bland after being steamed.

      1 lb Flank steak
      1    Egg white
      2 tb Soy sauce; divided
      3 ts Cornstarch; divided
  1 1/2 ts Sesame oil
      4    Green onions with tops
      2    Jalapeno peppers
      1    Navel orange; large
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Dry sherry
      1 tb White vinegar
      2 c  Medium carrots; julienned
      2    Cl Garlic; minced
           Hot cooked rice; optional
           Orange-peel rose for garnish
           Mint leaves for garnish
 
  Recipe by: Quick & Easy Stir Fry Recipes Cut beef lengthwise in half.
  Cut across the grain into 2 x 1/4-inch slices. Whisk together egg
  white, 1 Tablespoon soy sauce, 1 teaspoon cornstarch and sesame oil
  in a large bowl. Add beef and toss to coat. Marinate 15 minutes or
  cover and refrigerate overnight.
  
  Cut onions crosswise into 3-inch pieces.  Cut lengthwise into fine
  slivers. Cut jalapenos lengthwise in half. Remove stems and seeds.
  Diagonally cut halves into 1/8-inch slices.  Set aside.
  
  Remove 2x3/4-inch strips of peel (colored portion only) from orange
  with vegetable peeler.  Cut peel into 1/8-inch-thick strips; set
  aside.
  
  Combine sugar, sherry, vinegar, remaining 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 2
  teaspoons cornstarch in small bowl; stir until smooth. Set aside.
  
  Heat vegetable oil in wok over medium-high heat until oil registers
  375F on deep fry thermometer.  Add carrots; fry about 3 minutes or
  until tender. Remove carrots with slotted spoon and place in large
  strainer set over medium bowl.  reheat oil; fry orange peel about 15
  seconds or until fragrant.  Remove to paper towels; drain.
  
  Add beef to wok; fry about 1 minute or just until meat turns light in
  color.  Remove beef to colander or strainer placed over large bowl.
  Reheat oil.  Place 1/3 of drained beef in oil; fry about 3 minutes or
  until browned.  Transfer beef to strainer with carrots. (Double
  frying the meat keeps the meat moist inside and crispy outside.)
  repeat with remaining beef in two batches, reheating oil to maintain
  temperature.
  
  Pour off oil from wok.  reheat wok over medium-high heat. Add onions,
  garlic and jalapenos; stir-fry about 30 seconds or until fragrant.
  Stir cornstarch mixture until smooth; add to wok. Cook and stir until
  sauce boils and thickens.  Add beef, carrots and orange peel;

  Recipe by: NURPPL@NURSE.EMORY.EDU * chopped in food processor to a

  Combine all of the ingredients except for the cooking oil. Mix well
  and form into 3-inch round patties, 1/4 inch thick. Setting the
  thrmostat to 360 degrees, heat an electric skillet, placing about 1
  inch of oil in the pan. Fry each patty, turning once, until golden
  brown. Serve with cucumber condiment that follows.
  
  NOTES: I have always found that the shrimp/fish mixture is too gooey
  to work with unless I coat each blob with some plain flour as I start
  to form it into a patty. I've also always made smaller patties (about
  1.5 inches across and 1/2 inch thick) because this size was easier to
  work with. Frying in a wok also works well.

 Categories: Soups, Seafood
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 lb Shrimp
    1/2    Scotch bonnet or other hot
           -chili, seeded
      4    Shallots
      2    Cloves garlic
      3    Scallions
      1    Inch fresh ginger
      1    Red bell pepper
      1    Green bell pepper
      3 tb Butter
      2    To 3 tsp curry powder
      6 c  Fish stock or bottled clam
           -broth
      2 c  Coconut milk
           Salt and freshly ground
           -black pepper
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh cilantro for
           -garnish
 
  "This recipe was loosely inspired by a dish at the retaurant Al Forno
  in Providence, R.I.  Curry powder, cilantro and scotch bonnet chilies
  lend the chowder a West Indian accent. (Scotch bonnet are the world's
  hottest chilies -- look for them at Caribbean markets. Or substitute
  a milder chili, such as serrano or jalapeno.) Be sure to use
  unsweetened coconut milk, which can be found canned in Indian,
  Southeast Asian, and Hispanic markets."
  
  Peel and devein the shrimp and cut into 1 inch pieces. Remove the
  crescent-shaped muscle on the side of the scallops. Cut large
  scallops in quarters, medium size ones in half, so that all are the
  same size. Mince the chili, shallots, garlic, scallions and ginger.
  Core, seed, and dice the peppers.
  
  Melt the butter in a large saucepan.  Cook the minced and diced
  vegetables over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until soft but not
  browned. Add the curry powder and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
  Add the fish stock and coconut milk and gently simmer for 5 minutes.
  
  Just before serving, add the shrimp and scallops. Gently simmer for 2
  to 3 minutes until the shellfish is firm. Correct the seasoning,
  adding salt, pepper and curry powder to taste. To serve, ladle the
  chowder into bowls and garnish each with chopped cilantro.
  
  Serves 8 to 10.

  ingredients. Bring to a boil and add cornstarch-water. Return to the

      Title: SHRIMP CREOLE
 Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Seafood
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Fresh shrimp, heads off
      1 qt Water
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      3 ea Med. yellow onions, chopped
      2 ea Large bell peppers, chopped
      5 ea Celery ribs, chopped fine
     10 ea Lge. tomatoes, peeled&seeded
      2 ts Salt
      1 ts Ground red pepper
    1/2 ts Ground black pepper
    1/2 ts Ground white pepper
      1 tb Fresh thyme or 2 t dried
      1 tb Fresh basil or 2 t dried
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
      5 ea Bay leaves
      1 c  Green onions, chopped
      1 c  Parsley, chopped
 
  Peel and devein the shrimp.  Place heads (if you have them), and
  peels in a small saucepan and add the water. Bring to a slow boil
  over medium-high heat and let boil slowly for 15-20 minutes. Strain
  and discard the heads and peels.
     Place the oil in a Dutch oven or other large, heavy pot and place
  over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, peppers, and celery and saute
  stirring often, until the vegetables are very soft, about 45 minutes.
  Stir in the tomatoes, salt, peppers, herbs, sugar, and shrimp stock
  and return to simmer.  Reduce heat to medium and let simmer for 2
  hours, stirring occasionally,  This is your creole sauce; it can be
  prepared 1 or 2 days in advance and stored in the refrigerator (I
  find the sauce is even better after sitting a couple of days in the
  refrigerator).
     When you are ready to serve, return the sauce to a simmer and add
  the shrimp.  Cook until they turn pink, 5-7 minutes. Stir in the
  green onions and parsley and let cook for 1 minute more. Serve on
  flat plates over beds of rice.
     Serves 6-8. SHRIMP AND HAM OR TASSO JAMBALAYA: Prepare Shrimp
  Creole as above, but add about a pound of cubed ham and a 4-ounce can
  of tomatoe sauce to the finished sauce and simmer 45 minutes more.
  Meanwhile, boil or steam 2-3 cups raw rice. Finish the sauce (which
  will be your jambalaya base) by adding the shrimp, green onions, and
  parsley as above. (If you are using leftover Shrimp Creole, remove
  the shrimp and reheat the sauce, add the ham and tomato sauce, and
  proceed as above. Return the shrimp to the pan at the end of
  cooking.) Place the hot, cooked rice in a large bowl, pour the
  jambalaya base over, mix well, and serve.
     You can also prepare this dish with sausage instead of ham. From

  MARINATE THE SHRIMP in the egg white and cornstarch for 20 minutes in
  the refrigerator. Fry the shrimp in 1 1/2 cups oil at a moderate
  temperature (325F). Or, to simplify, stir-fry them in a wok in 3
  tablespoons of oil just until they turn opaque. Remove them from the
  wok. Brown the ground pork in 2 tablespoons of oil. Add the rest of
  the sauce ingredients. Bring them to a boil and add the cornstarch to
  thicken the sauce lightly. Turn off the heat. Stir in the beaten egg,
  pulling the clumps of egg into thin strands with chopsticks as they
  cook. Stir in the cooked shrimp to coat them with the sauce.

      Title: SHRIMP IN RED SAUCE
 Categories: Seafood, Chinese
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Shrimp; large, uncooked
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Rice wine
           Ginger, fresh, 2" piece
      3    Scallions
      1 tb Cornstarch
    1/4 c  Water
      1 tb Peanut oil
      1 tb Water (or more)
      3 tb Peanut oil
      3 tb Ketchup
      5 tb Water
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  1. Rinse the shrimps well under running water. Pull off legs, but
  leave the shells on.* Using a scissors, cut a small slit about
  one-third of the way up the back of the shell. (This will allow the
  marinade and cooking sauce to penetrate the shrimps more easily. You
  can, if you want, also remove the dark intestine on the back of the
  shrimp.)
  
  2. Put the shrimps in a bowl and add 1 teaspoon salt and the rice
  wine.
  
  3. Peel the ginger and chop it into small pieces, about the size of a
  match head. Add 1 teaspoonful of the chopped ginger to the shrimps in
  the bowl and set the rest aside. Stir the shrimps well, then let
  stand for at least 30 minutes.
  
  4. Clean the scallions, then chop the white parts into the same size
  pieces as the ginger.
  
  5. Mix the cornstarch and 1/4 c water together in a small bowl.
  
  COOKING: 6. Pour off the excess liquid from the shrimps, but don't
  rinse them off. (It is all right for the little bits of ginger to
  remain on the shrimps.)
  
  7. Heat the pan over a fairly high flame for about 15 seconds, then
  add 1 tablespoon peanut oil. The oil will be hot enough to cook with
  when the first tiny bubbles form and a few small wisps of smoke
  appear.
  
  8. Throw in the shrimps and stir-fry them over high heat for 1 or 2
  minutes, until they are nearly cooked, using your cooking shovel or
  spoon in a scooping motion to toss the shrimps around in the pan so
  they are all exposed to the hot oil. When the shrimps are almost
  done, they will begin to turn pink and become slightly stiff. (If
  they seem too dry, you can add a little water during the stir-frying
  process.)
  
  9. Lower the heat, cover the pan, and let the shrimps cook for 5
  minutes more. Then remove them from the pan and set them aside.
  
  10. Clean out the pan by wiping it with a paper towel, then reheat it
  over a fairly high flame. Pour in 3 tablespoons fresh peanut oil.
  When it is hot enough, quickly add the rest of the chopped ginger,
  scallions, and ketchup and stir-fry vigorously for no more than
       10    seconds.
  
  11. Immediately add 5 tablespoons water, the sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon
  salt and let the mixture come to a boil. Let it cook for about 1
  minute, then return the shrimps to the pan.
  
  12. Stir the cornstarch and water thoroughly to make sure they are
  well combined, then pour the mixture into the pan. Stirfry the
  shrimps and the sauce until the sauce has become clear and thick;
  this should not take more than about 30 seconds.
  
  13. Taste the sauce for salt before you serve it, and stir it up a
  little on the serving platter just before you bring it to the table.
  (This is to make sure that no film has formed on the sauce that would
  spoil its bright, fresh appearance.)
  
  14. Serve over rice.

      Title: SHRIMP ON CRAB LEGS (CANG CUA BOC TOM)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
     10    Crab legs or several hard
           -shell crabs
           Shrimp paste, prepared as
           -for Shrimp on Sugar Cane
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil

MMMMM-------------------------NUOC CHAM------------------------------
      1    Clove garlic
    1/2    Fresh hot red chili pepper
           -or 2 dried
      2 ts Heaping, granulated sugar
    1/8    Fresh lime
      2 tb Fish sauce (nuoc mam)
  2 1/2 tb Water, more if necessary
 
  Here we have a party dish that will bring out "oohs" and "ahs" from
  your guests on sight - and a repeat performance on taste.
  
  Crab claws, alone, are sometimes available in fish stores. If they
  aren't, boil several hard shell crabs and use the claws; you can use
  the bodies in many other dishes.
  
  The crab claws in fish stores are already partially peeled and serve
  not only as a handle but are edible as well. If you prepare your own
  claws, peel the upper section around which you mold the shrimp paste.
  
  Boil the crab legs or crabs for about 10 minutes, then drain and cool;
  remove the claws from the crabs, if using, and reserve the bodies for
  another purpose.
  
  Have the shrimp paste ready; preheat the oven to 350F.
  
  Pour the oil into a bowl.  Dip your fingers into the oil and pick up 2
  tablespoons of the shrimp paste. Mold it into an oval around and
  halfway down the crab claw, covering the part of the claw where it
  was attached to the body; this will leave a claw tip extended to
  serve as a handle. Place the claws on a baking sheet and bake in the
  preheated oven for 30 minutes.
  
  Serve with Nuoc Cham and watercress.
  
  NOTE:  In Vietnam, this dish is always barbecued over charcoal. If
  you wish to prepare it this way, cook for 10 minutes on each side.
  
  Makes 10 servings.

  NUOC CHAM:
  
  This exciting sauce is almost always served at Vietnamese meals, just
  a Westerners serve salt and pepper. It's base is nuoc mam (bottled
  fish sauce). Freshly prepared, it is a constant delight, and so
  addictive to Western palettes that it will appear with meals other
  than Vietnamese. To best appreciate the results of its superb
  blending qualities at the table, use it sparingly at first, gradually
  adding more until the result is just right for your palate.
  
  Peel the garlic.  Split the chili pepper down the center and remove
  the seeds and membrane.  Cut into pieces and put into a mortar,
  together with the garlic and sugar. Pound into a paste. Squeeze the
  lime juice into the paste, then with a small knife remove the pulp
  from the lime section and add it as well. Mash this mixture and add
  the fish sauce and water.
  
  NOTE:  If you find this a trifle strong at first, dilute it with an
  additional 1/2 tablespoon of water.

      Title: SHRIMP ON SUGAR CANE (CHAO TOM)
 Categories: Vietnamese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 lb Raw shrimp in shell
      4    Cloves garlic
      1 ts Rock sugar, pounded to a
           -powder, or 1 teaspoon
           -granulated sugar
      2    Egg whites, beaten until
           -slightly frothy
      1 tb Roasted Rice Powder
           Sprinkling of freshly
           -ground black pepper
      2 tb Pork fat, boiled for 10
           -minutes and diced very
           -small
      1    Twelve-inch section sugar
           -cane
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil, approximately
           Basic Vegetable Platter
           -[see below]
     12    Dried rice papers (banh
           -trang)

MMMMM-------------------NUOC LEO WITH TAMARIND------------------------
      1 tb Tamarind paste
    1/2 c  Plus 3 tablespoons water
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      2    Cloves garlic, chopped
    1/3 c  Tuong
      1 ts Granulated sugar
      2 tb Peanut butter
      2 tb Roasted Peanuts
 
  The "tuong" referred to below is a Vietnamese soybean preparation++a
  kind of thin, salty paste.  If you can't find it, you *might* get
  away with substituting Chinese bean sauce, mashed and thinned a bit
  with water, or possibly a dark Japanese miso. Although you can make
  this in a food processor or blender, it's best to pound it in a
  mortar with a pestle to achieve that certain crunchiness which is a
  most desirable quality of much Vietnamese food.  Bach started using a
  mortar and pestle when she was thirteen years old, working with a
  pestle that was about a yard long and 5 inches in diameter.  Although
  her family hand many servants, her mother, a great cook, wanted Bach
  to learn to use this tool properly. And Bach, who loved to cook as
  much then as she does now, was a willing and eager student. In
  Vietnam, where this is a very important dish, both the sugar cane and
  shrimp, fresh from the sea, are brought to the door by the country
  people.  If you cannot obtain sugar cane, you can prepare this dish
  with crab claws instead. In the West, we have been making this in the
  oven. Originally it was barbecued over charcoal, and if you with you
  can do the same.  Just cook it for 10 minutes on each side and this
  attractive dish will be reproduced exactly as it is in Vietnam. Shell
  and devein the shrimp, them rinse.  Dry thoroughly in paper towels,
  blotting many times. Mash the garlic in a mortar, then add the
  shrimp, a few at a time and mash to a paste. If the mortar is not
  large enough, it will be necessary to remove the already prepared
  shrimp paste to make room for the additional shrimp to be pounded.
  After all the shrimp is reduced to a smooth paste, pound the sugar
  into the shrimp, then add the egg white and pound with the pestle
  until well blended. Finally add the roasted rice powder, black
  pepper, and pork fat, combining all the ingredients. Peel the sugar
  cane. Cut into 4-inch lengths and then split lengthwise into
  quarters. Pour about 1/4 cup of oil into a bowl. Dip your fingers
  into the oil and pick up about 2 tablespoons of shrimp paste.  Mold
  it into an oval, around and halfway down the sugar cane, leaving half
  of the sugar cane exposed to serve as a handle.  Proceed until you
  have used up all the shrimp paste. Preheat the oven to 350F.  Put the
  shrimp on sugar cane on a baking sheet, then bake for 30 minutes or
  until brown. Serve with the vegetable platter, dried rice papers, and
  nuoc leo with tamarind, as follows: Each person is given a dried rice
  paper, and, dipping his finger in water, he moistens the entire
  surface of the paper, which soon becomes soft and flexible. He then
  helps himself, from the vegetable platter, to some lettuce, cucumber,
  coriander, and mint, if available. Then he takes a sugar cane stick,
  removes the shrimp patty, breaks it in half lengthwise, and places it
  on top of the vegetables, all in a cylinder, at one end of the rice
  paper. Then he folds over each side to enclose the filling and rolls
  it up. Holding it in his hand, he then dips it in his own small bowl
  of sauce. While you eat the shrimp in rice paper, you can also chew
  on the sugar cane. Makes 6 servings. NUOC LEO WITH TAMARIND: Soak the
  tamarind paste in the 3 tablespoons water. Heat the oil and add the
  chopped garlic; cook briefly. Add the water from the tamarind to the
  saucepan, discarding the remaining tamarind paste and seeds. Stir and
  add the tuong, 1/2 cup water, sugar, peanut butter. Mix well and boil
  for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Sprinkle the nuts on top of the
  sauce and pour into individual bowls for serving. ROASTED RICE
  (THINH): Roasted rice is used quite frequently in Vietnamese cooking.
  We generally prepare a quantity of it and keep it in a jar to have on
  hand when needed. 1 cup rice Heat a small, dry frying pan over high
  heat and add the rice. Toast, stirring constantly, until rice is
  brown.  Transfer to a blender and grind into a powder. Store as
  suggested above. From "The Classic Cuisine of Vietnam", Bach Ngo and

  & 1/2 for at least 30 minutes.   Drain and roll shrimp in flour and
  saute in oil over medium heat for 5 minutes. Do not turn shrimp. Re-
  move and place shrimp in baking dish, sauted side down in pre-heated
  oven. Turn oven to broil and broil for 5 minutes. For sauce: Mix egg
  yolk and lemon juice in half the butter and stir over low heat until
  melted, take off heat. Add garlic and rest of butter and stir briskly
  until butter melts and sauce thickens. (Add small amount of 1/2 & 1/2

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Shrimp, cooked and peeled
    1/2 lb Butter
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Celery salt
    1/8 ts Cayenne Pepper
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
 
  Toast crumbs
  
  Grind the shrimp very fine.  Cream the butter until soft and add the
  ground shrimp, mixing well.  Then add the seasonings and combine
  thoroughly. Place in an oblong baking dish and sprinkle toast crumbs
  over the top of the shrimp mixture.  Brown in a hot oven (400) for
  about three minutes. Cool and place in the refrigerator until time to
  serve (for several hours at least.)
  
  This paste is not as firm as the preceding one, and it has a much more
  buttery flavor.  The nutmeg is quite noticeable, although it blends
  well with the shrimp. --Mrs. Walter Pringle

  Unlike some other kinds of sambal, this one doesn't keep, so make it
  in small quantities-just enough for one meal. It is very hot.
  
  Boil the chillis for 6 minutes, seed them, and cut them up small. Then
  pound them together with the shallot, garlic, and grilled terasi.
  Season with salt, sugar if desired, and lime juice.

  Pound finely the chilli, onion and shrimp paste with salt to taste.
  Add lemon juice and blend well. Place in a bowl. This sambal is well
  known throughout the archipelago. However I recommend it only for
  addicts. If you want to make Indonesian newcomers feel at home, serve
  it with vegetables, plain boiled rice and with a grill. Anchovy
  fillets, about 2 pieces, may be substituted for shrimp paste if you
  wish.

      Title: SHRIMP RISOTTO
 Categories: Italian, Seafood, Rice
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Shrimp (unshelled)
      1    Bay leaf
           Celery leaves (A few)
      6    Peppercorns
           Salt, to taste
           Saffron threads (A few)
  3 3/4 c  Water
      6 tb Butter, divided
      1    Onion, chopped
      1    Clove garlic, crushed
      2 c  Italian Arborio rice
  1 1/4 c  Dry white wine
      2    Zucchini, cut into thin
           -strips
      6 oz Oyster mushrooms, cut into
           -pieces
      2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
    1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese,
           -divided
 
  Rinse and peel the shrimp; set aside.  Rinse the shrimp shells, then
  put them in a saucepan along with the bay leaf, celery leaves,
  peppercorns, salt, saffron, and water. Bring to a boil, then simmer
  for 20 minutes. Strain and reserve the stock.
  
  In a heavy large saucepan or skillet, melt 3 tablespoons of the
  butter; add the onion and garlic. Cook for about 5 minutes or until
  softened but not colored.  Add the rice and stir to coat all the
  grains with butter. Add 1/3 of the reserved stock and bring to a
  boil, then simmer, uncovered, until the stock is absorbed. Stirring,
  gradually add more stock and the wine until it has all been absorbed
  and the rice is cooked; this will take about 20 minutes.
  
  In a separate pan, melt the remaining butter, add the shrimp,
  zucchini, and mushrooms; cook for 3 or 4 minutes. Fold the mixture
  into the rice along with the rice and half of the cheese. Taste and
  add salt, if needed.
  
  Serve piping hot, sprinkled with the remaining cheese.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

  wrappers can be placed on the table (with bowls of warm water for
  softening) with a platter of fillings, so that guests can make a meal
  of them. One half fresh pineapple, peeled, eyes removed, halved,
  cored and thinly sliced, 2 tomatoes, thinly sliced, 1/2 cup fresh
  cilantro leaves, coarsely chopped, 1/2 cup fresh mint leaves,
  coarsely chopped Nuoc Cham dipping sauce, with carrot shreds
  DIRECTIONS: Cook shrimp in salted, boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes,
  or until pink and firm to the touch. Drain and cool. Peel and devein
  shrimp, or serve them in their shells and let diners peel them at the
  table. Blanch bean sprouts in boiling water for 1 minute. Drain and
  refresh with cold water.
  
  To assemble: Moisten rice papers in warm water for 10 to 20 seconds,
  or until softened. Place a lettuce leaf inside each piece of softened
  rice paper. Fill with a few shrimp, a little pineapple, bean sprouts,
  tomato, cilantro and/or mint. Roll up the bundles and serve with Nuoc
  Cham.

      Title: SHRIMP SAUCE PIQUANT
 Categories: Cajun, Sauces, Fish
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 tb Unsalted butter
  2 1/4 c  Chopped onions
  1 1/2 c  Chopped green bell peppers
    3/4 c  Chopped celery
      3 c  Peeled & chopped tomatoes
      1 c  Canned tomato sauce
      3 tb Minced jalapeno (see note)
      2    Bay leaves
  5 1/2 ts Ground cayenne pepper
  1 1/2 ts White pepper
      1 ts Ground black pepper
  1 1/2 ts Minced garlic
  2 1/4 c  Basic seafood stock
  1 1/2 ts Dark brown sugar
    3/4 ts Salt
      2 lb Peeled large shrimp
      4 c  Hot basic cooked rice
 
  NOTE:  Fresh jalapenos are preferred; if you have to use pickled ones,
  rinse as much vinegar from them as possible. Melt the butter in a
  4-quart saucepan over high heat. Add the onions, bell peppers and
  celery; saute about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the
  tomatoes, tomato sauce, jalapenos, bay leaves, ground peppers and
  garlic; stir well. Continue cooking about 3 minutes, stirring often
  and scraping the pan bottom well. Stir in the stock, sugar and salt
  and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until flavors are
  married, about 20 minutes, stirring often and scraping pan bottom as
  needed.  (If mixture scorches, quit stirring and pour mixture into a
  clean pot, leaving the scorched ingredients in the first pan.) Add
  the shrimp to the hot (or reheated) sauce and stir. Turn heat up to
  high, cover pan, and bring mixture to a boil. Remove from heat. Let
  sit covered for 10 minutes. (Meanwhile, heat the serving plates in a
  250F oven.)  Stir, remove bay leaves, and serve immediately. To
  serve, mound 1/2 cup rice in the center of each heated serving plate;
  then pour about 1/2 cup sauce around the rice and arrange about 8
  shrimp on top of the sauce. LAGNIAPPE:  "Piquant" to a Cajun means
  "it's hot and 'hurts like a sticker in your tongue.'" If you want
  less "piquant," reduce the jalapeno peppers by half.  Sauce Piquant
  is enjoyed with such gusto in Louisiana that the town of Raceland has
  a Sauce Piquant Festival every year dedicated to nothing but fish,
  meat, fowl and seafood made with variations of this sauce. From Paul
  Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen

  A basic "shrimp scampi"-type recipe. Vary this recipe by adding fresh
  herbs (rosemary, tarragon, oregano) or vegetables (snow peas, red
  peppers, tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes). I suggest serving it over
  linguine.
  
  PEEL AND DEVEIN the shrimp. Heat the olive oil in a saute pan. Add the
  garlic and saute 1 minute. Add the shrimp and saute just until they
  turn pink. Add the wine and cook until it begins to simmer. Sprinkle
  with parsley and stir in the salt and pepper.

      1 lb Fresh jumbo shrimp
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine
      2 tb Lemon juice
      2 tb Dried parsley flakes
      1    To 2 cloves garlic,

  1. Under cold running water, remove the shells from the shrimp,
  leaving last tail section attached. Using a sharp, thin-bladed knife
  make a shallow cut lengthwise down the back of each shrimp and wash
  out the sand vein. If desired, the shrimp may be butterflied (cut
  lengthwise down the back of each shrimp, cutting almost completely
  through the shrimp, removing sand vein). 2. In a shallow, 2-quart,
  heat-resistant, non-metallic baking dish place butter, lemon juice,
  parsley flakes, garlic to taste and salt. 3. Heat, uncovered, in
  Microwave Oven 2 minutes. 4. Add shrimp and stir to coat well. If
  desired, sprinkle with paprika. 5. Heat, uncovered, in Microwave Oven
  6 minutes. Stir shrimp occasionally. Cook just until shrimp are pink
  and tender. Do not overcook shrimp as they will become tough.
  Variation: If desired, lobster, scallops, crabmeat or any combination
  of these may be substituted for shrimp.

  shrimp for each cap or cut a larger one in half. Peel & devein shrimp
  and insert it (either the half or the whole shrimp) in the mushroom
  cap. Pipe a small rosette of the butter into---> each mushroom cap.

      1 lg Egg
      1 tb Water
      2 tb Cooking oil
    1/2 lb Ground pork (not sausage)
    1/2 c  Chicken broth
    1/2 tb Thin soy sauce
      1 ts Sugar
           Cornstarch paste
 
  Contrary to popular belief, lobster sauce does not contain lobster.
  It's delicious served OVER lobster or shrimp.
  
  Lobster Sauce:  Soak salted black beans for 10 minutes; rinse &
  drain. Mash with garlic. Cut green onions in 1/2" sections. In small
  bowl, beat egg with water.
  
  Shrimp: Shell, devein & butterfly shrimp. To butterfly shrimp, slice
  along the back about 3/4 of the way through the flesh with a small
  paring knife. Spread shrimp open; cover but do not refrigerate.
  
  To stir-fry, heat wok to medium-high.  When hot, dribble oil around
  side of pan.  Put shrimp in wok all at once, & start tossing. Keep
  shrimp in motion, so they will cook uniformly. When they just begin
  to curl, remove to the serving dish.
  
  Heat wok to medium; add remaining oil.  When oil is hot (not smoking)
  add garlic/bean mixture.  Stir briskly until aroma of beans & garlic
  is strong, but don't overcook. Add ground pork in little pieces;
  stir-fry until cooked, about 4 minutes.  Add broth, soy sauce &
  sugar, stirring while mixture comes to a boil. Thicken mixture with
  corn- starch paste to create a light cream-like sauce (not too
  thick). Slowly stir in beaten egg. Cook briefly.  Add shrimp. Mix and
  serve.

  1 1/2 ts Sesame oil
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
  1 1/2 tb Minced fresh ginger
  1 1/2 tb Minced scallions
      1    Egg white, lightly beaten
  1 1/2 tb Cornstarch
           TO ASSEMBLE:
     48    Wonton skins
           Cornstarch for dusting
           TO FINISH:
      4 c  Homemade chicken broth
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Sesame oil
     10 oz Fresh spinach, stems
           -removed, rinsed and drained
 
  FILLING:
  
  Place the shrimp in a linen dish towel or on paper towels and squeeze
  out as much moisture as possible. Chop the shrimp to a paste in a food
  processor fited with a steel blade or by hand. Place the water
  chestnuts in a towel and squeeze out as much moisture as possible.
  Place the shrimp paste, water chestnuts, soy sauce, rice wine, sesame
  oil, salt, pepper, ginger, scallions and egg white in a mixing bowl.
  Using your hand or a spoon, stir vigorously in one direction to
  combine the ingredients evenly. Add the cornstarch and stir to blend.
  The mixture should be stiff.
  
  Use a fork, teaspoon or two chopsticks to place a scant teaspoonful
  of the filling in the center of each wonton skin. Gather the edges of
  the skin together around the filling and squeeze to form a "waist" as
  you gradually remove the fork, teaspoon or chopsticks. Squeeze the
  "waist" and the ends shut to enclose the filling. The finished
  dumpling should look like a drawstring purse.  Place the finished
  dumplings on a tray that has been lightly dusted with cornstarch.
  
  Heat 3 quarts of water to boiling in a large pot.  Add the wontons and
  cover.  Once the water is boiling again, cook for about 4 minutes or
  until they rise to the surface. Remove with a long-handled strainer
  and drain. Discard the water.  Heat the chicken stock, salt and
  sesame to boiling. Add the spinach and cooked wontons and portion
  into serving bowls. Serve.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: SHRIMP&SHIITAKE POTSTICKERS W/CHILI OIL & WARM CABBAGE SA
 Categories: Appetizers, Salads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/4 lb Shiitake mushrooms, stems
           -removed, caps cut in half
           -and then cut
           Crosswise into thin slices
      2    Scallions including green
           -tops, minced
      2 tb Chopped cilantro
      1 tb Minced fresh ginger
      6 tb Cooking oil, more if needed
      3 tb Soy sauce
    1/2 lb Medium shrimp, shelled and
           -chopped
    1/4 ts Salt
     36    Round gyoza* or wonton
           -wrappers
      1    Egg white, beaten
      1    Head napa cabbage, cut into
           -2-inch squares
      4    Carrots, cut into
           -2-inch-long matchstick
           -strips
      2 tb Rice-wine vinegar
      1 tb Vietnamese chili sauce*
      2 ts Honey
      2 tb Chili oil
 
  *Available at Asian markets
  
  From: - Boulevard * San Francisco -
  
  1. Heat the oven to 350 B0. In a medium bowl, toss the shiitakes with
  the scallions, cilantro, ginger, 1 tablespoon of the cooking oil and 1
  tablespoon of the soy sauce. Spread the mixture on a small baking
  sheet and bake until the mushrooms are soft, about 5 minutes.
  Transfer the mushroom mixture to a medium bowl and let cool. Stir the
  shrimp and salt into the mushrooms.
  
  2. Lay a few of the gyoza or wonton wrappers on a work surface. Put
  about 11/2 teaspoons of the filling in the center of each. Brush the
  edges with egg white and fold in half, pleating the edges as you go.
  Put the potstickers on a baking sheet lightly dusted with flour and
  repeat to make
       36    potstickers.
  
  3. In a large frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the cooking oil over
  moderately high heat. Add half the cabbage. Cook, stirring
  occasionally, until lightly browned and just beginning to wilt, about
  3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Add another tablespoon oil to the pan.
  Cook the remaining cabbage. Remove. Add another tablespoon oil and
  cook the carrots until they begin to brown, about 3 minutes. Add to
  the cabbage.
  
  4. In a small bowl, stir together the remaining 2 tablespoons soy
  sauce, the rice-wine vinegar, Vietnamese chili sauce and honey. Add
  this mixture to the cabbage and carrots and stir to combine.
  
  5. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Heat the remaining 2
  tablespoons cooking oil in a medium frying pan. Put 6 potstickers in
  a strainer and immerse them in the boiling water for 1 to 2 minutes.
  Drain and add the potstickers to the hot frying pan. Be careful, the
  oil may spatter. Cook the potstickers on both sides until brown,
  about 2 minutes in all. Transfer the potstickers to a baking sheet
  and keep them warm in a low oven while cooking the rest. Add more oil
  to the pan if necessary.
  
  6. Reheat the cabbage if necessary. Put a mound of the cabbage salad
  in the center of six plates. Arrange 6 potstickers around the salad
  and drizzle each plate with about a teaspoon of the chili oil.
  
  !Make It Ahead! Nearly all the work for this can be done in advance.
  The cabbage salad and the boiled potstickers can both be made a day
  ahead. Then, before serving, just reheat the cabbage and saute the
  potstickers for two minutes.
  
  Either a red or a white will go nicely with the complex flavors here;
  choose a simple, light-bodied bottle. One from the C F4tes-du-Rh F4ne
  region of France would be good.

      1 c  Chili sauce
     15 ea Sl Bacon; cut in half
 
  Shell and devein shrimp. Marinate raw shrimp in chili sauce for 1

 Categories: Main dish, Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Large raw shrimp in shell
    1/2 c  Peanut oil or salad oil
    1/2 c  Lemon juice
      1 ts Italian seasoning
      1 ts Seasoned salt
    1/2 ts Seasoned pepper
      2 tb Brown sugar
      1 ts Soy sauce
    1/4 c  Green onions, thinly sliced
 
  Wash shrimps under cold running water; remove feelers but do not
  shell; drain on paper toweling.  Place in medium size bowl. Stir
  peanut oil or salad oil, lemon juice, Italian seasoning, and seasoned
  salt and pepper together.  Pour over shrimp and let stand for about
  30 minutes -- stirring frequently.  I prefer to let them stay in the
  marinade overnight in the frig. Lift shrimp from the marinade about
  1/2 hour before barbecuing and let them drain. Place on grill about 6
  inches from hot coals. Brush with marinade.  Grill, turning once and
  brushing with marinade. Takes about 6 minutes per side or until pink.
  Pour remaining marinade into a small saucepan, stir in brown sugar
  and soy sauce. Heat to boiling, then stir in green onions. Serve
  separately as a dip for shrimp. Have plenty of napkins or damp
  washcloths.  I use shrimp that is 12-16 per lb. I figure about 4 per
  person -- but sometimes for big eaters 6 per person. I then make an
  extra half of recipe of the marinade.

  Cut thick slices (about 4) of French bread into quarters. Drizzle
  with some olive oil.  Bake in a hot oven until golden brown, turning
  several times. Can be made in advance and kept in a sealed container
  for several days. These will be your croutons.
  
  To cook tableside, choose a large chafing dish or skillet that sits
  securely over a flame.
  
  Prepare ingredients ahead of time and place in individual bowls.
  Lightly sprinkle shrimp with flour. Heat oil and butter in skillet
  until bubbling. Add quartered garlic cloves and cook, stirring, over
  medium heat for several minutes, to infuse butter with garlic
  essence. Remove garlic.
  
  Add shrimp and cook briefly on one side - just until they turn pink.
  With tongs, quickly turn and cook other side. Add white wine,
  tomatoes, herbs, salt and pepper. Cook 2 minutes longer, stirring
  frequently.
  
  Place croutons in and around the shrimp.  Turn to let both sides of
  croutons absorb some of the butter-garlic juices. Serve at once,
  giving each person several shrimp and croutons, then spooning over
  some of the tomatoes and sauce.

 Categories: Entrees
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
MMMMM-------------------------DUMPLINGS------------------------------
      2 lb Turkey, ground
  1 1/2 ts Cornstarch (cornflour)
  1 1/2 ts Sherry, dry
      3 tb Light soy sauce
      1 tb Ginger, grated
           -or finely chopped
      6    Green onions, chopped
      6    Garlic cloves,
           -crushed, minced
           -or pressed
      1 tb Brown sugar
      1 tb Sesame oil
      1 pk Wonton wrappers
           Peanut oil

MMMMM-----------------------DIPPING SAUCE----------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Fish sauce (You may
           -want to dilute this
           -with water, depending
           -on its strength)
      1 c  Vinegar
      1 c  Sugar
      6    Garlic cloves, finely
           -minced or pressed
      1 tb Ginger, finely
           -minced or grated
      1 tb Red pepper, crushed
 
  Make the dipping sauce by mixing together all of its ingredients.
  Store in the refrigerator until you are ready to use it.
  
  Stir together everything but the wrappers and the peanut oil. Mix
  vigorously by hand until it begins to bind together. (About 1 minute
  or so.)
  
  Place about 1 1/2 - 2 T of filling in the middle of a wonton wrapper.
  Fold the sides up around the meat so that you have a little bag or
  cup. Press the bottom flat so that the bag doesn't fall over.
  
  Oil racks of the steamer with peanut oil.  Place dumplings in racks.
  Steam for 15 to 20 minutes in covered rack over boiling water. Serve
  hot with dipping sauce.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Steamed dumplings (meatballs) -- This recipe is an adaptation of
  the one in "The Frugal Gourmet" by Jeff Smith. The bigger the batch,
  the better. There are never leftovers. Yield: makes 35-40.
  
  *  These little gems would probably go just fine with a favorite
  hoisin or chili dipping sauce.
  
  *  The steamer racks I recommend are the Chinese bamboo ones. You can
  stack them quite nicely (I find that three racks work well) and they
  sit at just the right height above the boiling water in a wok. The
  real advantage is that water will not condense on your food if you
  use a bamboo steamer.
  
  *  The dipping sauce is an adaption of one served at the Phoenix
  Vietnamese restaurant in Saint Paul Minnesota; it was originally
  served with egg rolls, but works splendidly with these dumplings.
  
  *  The original recipe calls for ground pork, but I find ground turkey
  preferable.  The flavor is lighter and the calories far fewer. Pork is
  fine, though, and even hamburger could be used in a pinch.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, but tedious.
  : Time:  45 minutes preparation, 15-20 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

 Categories: Soups, Middle east, Egypt, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Red lentils
      2 qt Stock
      1 md Onion, peeled & quartered
      1 md Tomato, quartered
      2 ts Garlic, coarsely chopped
      4 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Onion, finely chopped

      1 ts Salt
           Black pepper, freshly ground
           Lemon, cut into wedges
 
  Wash the lentils in a large sieve or colander set under cold running
  water until the draining water runs clear. In a heavy 4 to 5 qt pot,
  bring the stock to a boil over high heat. Add the lentils, onion,
  tomato and garlic, reduce the heat to low, and simmer partially
  covered for 45 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. Meanwhile,
  in a small skillet, heat 1 tb of the oil over moderate heat. Add the
  chopped onions and, stirring frequently, cook for 10 minutes, or
  until they are soft and deeply browned. Set aside off the heat. Puree
  the soup through a food mill or pour the entire contents of the pot
  into a sieve set over a deep bowl and force the ingredients through
  with the back of a large spoon, pressing down hard on the vegetables
  before discarding the pulp. Return the soup to the pot and, stirring
  constantly, cook over low heat for 3 or 4 minutes to heat through.
  Stir in the cumin, salt and pepper, and taste for seasoning. Just
  before serving, stir in the remaining 3 tbs of oil. To serve, ladle
  the soup into a heated tureen, sprinkle lightly with the reserved
  browned onions and serve the lemon wedges separately.

      Title: SICHUAN CRISPY SKIN DUCK
 Categories: Chinese, Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Fresh Duck, 4 1/2 pounds
      3    Or 4 Star Anise
      2 ts Sichuan peppercorns
      1    Two-inch cinnamon stick
  1 1/2 tb Coarse salt
      1    One-inch cube ginger,
           -smashed
      1    Scallion
           Dark soy sauce
      1 tb Dry sherry or Shaoxing wine
      1 tb Cornstarch
    1/2 ts Sugar
      1    Egg white, beaten until
           -foamy
           Oil for frying
 
  Rinse the duck and dry thoroughly.  Combine the star anise, Sichuan
  peppercorns, cinnamon and salt in a skillet; heat, shaking the
  skillet, until the spices begin to smoke and the salt starts to turn
  a light golden color.  Cool.
  
  Sprinkle some of this mixture into the cavity of the duck including
  all the star anise and the cinnamon stick. Add the ginger and
  scallion to the cavity and skewer closed. Rub the outside of the duck
  with the rest of the seasoned salt mixture and hang the duck by a
  string (around the neck if the duck has a head or under the wings if
  not) overnight in a cool, airy place.
  
  The next day, steam the duck on a plate in a large steamer or covered
  wok for an hour to an hour and 15 minutes. Cool and rub all over with
  a small amount of dark soy sauce. Wrap in foil and refrigerate until
  ready to cook. (It's fine this way for a day or two.) Several hours
  before cooking, take the duck out of the refrigerator and make a
  light batter: Mix the sherry with the cornstarch and sugar until well
  blended then stir in the egg white.  Rub thoroughly over the duck and
  allow to sit.
  
  Heat a large quantity of oil until nearly smoking in a 16-inch or
  larger wok or in a large deep fryer. Immerse the duck in the oil and
  fry until golden, about 15 minutes, spooning the oil continuously
  over the exposed part of the duck.  You might want to turn the duck
  during this time. If so, carefully remove it with a large slotted
  spatula or skimmer and drain the cavity into a bowl before adding it
  again to the hot oil. When the duck is done, drain it on paper
  towels. Let the duck rest for 5 to 10 minutes, then carve it
  Western-style or cut into pieces, Chinese-style. A suggestion is to
  serve it on a bed of watercress that has been sprinkled very lightly
  with sesame oil.  The juices from the duck will blend with the sesame
  oil to make a sauce.
  
  TEA-SMOKED DUCK; Follow the steps above and steam the duck only 1
  hour. Before refrigerating, line a large wok with aluminum foil and
  spread 1 cup of uncooked rice, 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of Chinese
  black tea over the bottom.  Put the duck on a metal rack suspended
  over the tea mixture; cover with the wok lid. Moisten paper towels
  and press them around the edge of the wok lid forming a seal.  Turn
  the heat to medium high and allow the duck to smoke for 15 to 20
  minutes. Turn off the heat and let the duck sit for another 45
  minutes. Uncover, wrap the duck and refrigerate. Then proceed as in
  the master recipe.

      4 oz Ground pork butt
      1    Green onion, minced
      1 ts Sugar
        pn White pepper
      2 ts Dark soy sauce
      2 tb Chicken stock
           A swirl of sesame oil
 
  This green-bean dish is outstanding.  The green beans exude aromatic
  flavors and have an interesting chewy texture. I do not fry the beans
  as long as traditional recipes call for because I want them to have
  some texture left.
  
  Cover the dried shrimp with hot water for 30 minutes. Drain. Chop
  into the consistency of coarse bread crumbs.
  
  Rinse the Sichuan preserved vegetables with cold water to wash off the
  brine and salt; chop into the same texture as the shrimp. In a hot
  wok add the oil and heat to 375F.
  
  Deep fry the beans in two or three batches for 2 to 3 minutes or
  until they look wrinkled, blistered and khaki color.
  
  Remove all but 1 tablespoon of the oil from the wok. Reheat the wok
  over high heat.
  
  Add the ginger and garlic; stir-fry for 15 seconds. Add the pork,
  preserved mustard, dried shrimp; stir-fry for 1 minute longer. Poke
  and break up the clumps of pork so that it looks crumbled.  Add the
  green onion, sugar, white pepper and soy sauce; toss together to
  blend.
  
  Return the reserved green beans, chicken stock and sesame oil; toss
  vigorously over high heat until all liquids are reduced and absorbed,
  about 2 to 3 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.

      1 c  Mixed candied fruit, chopped
           -fine
      4 oz Good quality bittersweet
           -chocolate, chopped fine
    1/2 c  Brandy, Maraschino liqueur
           -or rum Frosting:
      1 c  Heavy cream, whipped
      3 tb Confectioners' sugar
      1 oz Bittersweet chocolate
    1/2 c  Maraschino cherries
    1/3 c  Pistachio nuts
 
  Serves 10-12
  
  Sponge cake:
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Grease a loaf pan.
  
  To prepare sponge cake, beat egg whites in a large bowl until soft
  peaks form. Sprinkle salt and sugar gradually over whites; continue
  beating until mixture is stiff. Fold in egg yolks and vanilla and
  blend well.
  
  Sift together flour and baking powder and gradually sprinkle over egg
  mixture, folding in well after each addition. Pour batter into
  greased loaf pan and bake until cake springs back to the touch and a
  toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (about 35
  minutes). Cool on a rack in pan for 5 minutes, then unmold and
  continue to cool.
  
  To prepare filling, combine ricotta, confectioners' sugar, candied
  fruit, chocolate and liquor of choice. Refrigerate until needed.
  
  To assemble cake, grease sides of a 3 1/2 to 4 quart straight sided
  bowl or pot and line bottom with a round of tinfoil. With a serrated
  knife, cut cake into 1/2 inch slices. Line bottom of bowl with a
  layer of slices and then line sides with cake. Spread about 1 1/2
  cups of filling on top and then set two more slices of cake on top of
  filling. Continue to layer in this way two more times, ending with
  remaining three or four slices of cake on top. Refrigerate for 6
  hours or overnight. When ready to serve, loosen sides with knife and
  invert bowl onto serving plate. Remove aluminum foil and frost.
  
  To prepare frosting, combine whipped cream and confectioners' sugar.
  Spread mixture on top and sides of cake. Shave chocolate on top of
  whipped cream and decorate with cherries and pistachio nuts.

  vegetables from bowl. Clean and dry bowl before chopping parsley with
  metal blade.

  1 1/2 ts Sugar
    1/2 c  Water
 
  Thick and rich with mushrooms, lentils and spices, this sauce is high
  in protein and fiber as well as in flavor. If you like a thick pasta
  sauce, this is it. In a large nonstick sauce pan over medium heat add
  onions mushrooms and garlic adding a bit of water to prevent
  sticking. Cook until tender, about 5 min. Add lentils and water.
  Bring to a boil stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low and cover
  and cook for 40 min. Add remaining ingredients and bring to a boil.
  Cover and cook 20 min stirring occasionally. add more water if a
  thinner sauce is desired. Serve over pasta or rice. Note: in the
  original recipe it called for sauteing the onions & mushrooms in 2 t
  of olive oil. You can do this but it will increase the cal & fat %

      Title: SICILIAN-STYLE PIZZA DOUGH
 Categories: Pizza
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Warm tap water (110 to 115
           -degrees)
      1 pk Active dry yeast
  4 1/2    To 5 cups flour
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      1 ts Salt
 
  1.  Pour the water into a medium-sized mixing bowl and sprinkle in the
  yeast. Stir gently with a fork until the yeast has dissolved and the
  liquid turns light beige in color.
  
  2.  Add 2 cups of the flour, the olive oil, and the salt. Mix
  thoroughly with a wooden spoon.  Add a third cup of flour to the bowl
  and mix well. After the third cup of flour has been mixed in, the
  dough should start coming away from the sides of the bowl and should
  begin to form a soft,sticky mass.
  
  3.  Measure out the fourth cup of flour.  Sprinkle some over the work
  surface and flour your hands generously. Remove all of the dough from
  the bowl and begin to work the mass by kneading the additional flour
  in a bit at a time.
  
  4.  To knead the dough, use the heel of your hands to push the dough
  across the floured work surface in one sweep. Clench the dough in
  your fist and twist and fold it over. Use the dough scraper to help
  gather the wet dough that sticks to the work surface into a ball
  while kneading. Repeat this action over and over again, adding only
  as much flour as it takes to keep the dough from sticking to your
  hands.  Work quickly and don't be delicate. Slap and push the dough
  around to develop its gluten and to facilitate its rolling out.
  (Kneading pizza dough is a great way to relieve pent-up aggression!)
  
  5.  When the dough no longer feels sticky, push the heel of your hand
  down into it and hold it there for 10 seconds. This will test its
  readiness;if your hand comes up clean, the dough is done. If it
  sticks, a bit more kneading will be necessary. Once the dough is no
  longer sticky, do not overwork it by adding more flour. Continue
  kneading only until the dough is smooth and elastic (it should spring
  back when pressed) and no lines of raw white flour show.  The whole
  process should take 5 to 10 minutes.
  
  6.  Lightly oil a 2 quart bowl with vegetable oil. Roll the ball of
  dough around in the bowl to coat it with a thin film of oil. Tightly
  seal the bowl with plastic wrap to trap in the moisture and heat from
  the yeast's carbon dioxide gases.  This will help the dough rise
  faster.
  
  7.  Place the bowl in a warm, draft-free place.  Let the dough rise
  for 30 to 45 minutes.
  
  8.  Once the dough has doubled in bulk, punch it down by pushing your
  fist into it.  All of the gases will quickly escape, and the dough
  will collapse. Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it again for
  about 1 minute.
  
  9.  The dough is now ready to be patted and rolled into pizza, or to
  undergo additional rising.
  
  10. To raise dough a second time, add a bit more oil to the bowl and
  repeat the procedure indicated for the first rising. Then the dough
  is ready to be shaped.

      Title: SICILIAN-STYLE SAUSAGE PATTIES
 Categories: Pork, Italian, Meats
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2 lb Fat-trimmed pork (or veal)
           -shoulder, ground
    1/2 c  Chianti wine
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      2 tb Minced fresh (or 2 tsp.
           -dried) thyme
      1 tb Paprika
      2 ts Salt (or smoke flavored
           -salt)
      1 ts Fennel seeds
    1/4 ts Each: black pepper and red
           -cayenne pepper (or more to
           -taste)
 
  Note:  It's not necessary to stuff meat mixtures into sausage
  casings. In fact, if you plan to barbecue, it's better to shape the
  meat into flat hamburger-like sausage patties that fit in pita
  pockets or on thin rounds of French or Italian Bread. To Make
  Patties: Combine all ingredients and mix lightly. Shape into patties,
  six per pound of meat. Raw patties may be frozen for later use;
  Arrange them in a single layer on a cookie tin lined with aluminum
  foil. Cover with foil, label and freeze. Patties may be barbecued or
  broiled without defrosting. To Cook: Place patties 3 inches from heat
  source and broil or barbecue for about two to three minutes per side
  (three to four minutes each side if frozen); be sure meat is cooked
  through.  Makes 12 patties, 130 calories each with pork; 100 calories
  each with veal.

      2 c  Garlic -- finely chopped
      2 ts Fresh ginger root -- scraped

    1/8 ts Ground cloves
    1/8 ts Ground allspice
    1/8 ts Ground nutmeg -- freshly
           Grated
    1/4 c  Paprika
      2 ts Berbere or awaze
    2/3 c  Dry red wine
    1/2 c  Water
      1 lg Firm ripe tomato *
      2 ts Salt
      3 lb Lean boneless beef **
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  * coarsely chopped and pureed through a food mill or rubbed through a
  sieve with a spoon. ** preferably chuck, trimmed of excess fat and
  cut into 1-inch cubes.
  
  In a heavy 4-5 qt. enameled casserole, cook the onions over moderate
  heat for 5-6 minutes, until they are soft and dry. Slide the
  casserole back and forth over the heat and stir the onions constantly
  to prevent them from burning; if necessary, reduce the heat or remove
  the casserole from the stove occasionally to let it cool for a few
  moments before returning it to the heat.  Stir in the niter kebbeh
  and when it begins to splutter, add the garlic, ginger, fenugreek,
  cloves, allspice and nutmeg, stirring well after each addition. Add
  the paprika and berbere, and stir over low heat for 2-3 minutes.
  
  Stir in the wine, water, pureed tomato and salt, and bring the liquid
  to a boil.  Add the beef cubes and turn them about with a spoon until
  they are evenly coated with the sauce. Then reduce the heat to low.
  Cover the pan partially and simmer the beef for about 1 1/2 hrs, or
  until it shows no resistance when pierced with a few grindings of
  pepper and taste for seasoning.
  
  To serve, transfer the entire contents of the casserole to a deep
  heated platter or bowl.  Sik sik wat is traditionally accompanied by
  injera or spice bread, but may also be eaten with Arab-style flat
  bread or hot boiled rice.  Yegomen kitfo and/or plain yoghurt may be
  served with the wat from separate bowls.

  [Heh!  Had you guys going with that kibble reference I'll bet.
  "Ceideburg's finally gone over the edge.  A pity..." Picked up a
  genuine cookbook for dog food yesterday. It's called "Bone Appetit!"
  Too cute, huh? Since I don't even like to cook for myself very much
  the pooch will just have to make do with leftovers, but it is an
  interesting book. Lots of doggie lore like the following about
  Basenjis, the "Silent Stalker" of the recipe title.]
  
  Basenjis are depicted in ancient Egyptian scrolls looking exactly as
  the breed does today.  Eventually Basenjis migrated further south in
  Africa, becoming silent stalkers for tribesmen in the Belgian Congo,
  where they were discovered by British explorers in the late
  nineteenth century. With an expressively wrinkled forehead, a tightly
  up curled tail, and no bark at all, the Basenjis was immediately
  favored as an export. Fastidiously clean by nature, the Basenjis has
  a grooming ritual that is similar to a cat's and involves licking the
  entire coat to clean it. The Basenjis' chortle, described as an
  appealing yodel, is its most distinguishing characteristic.

      Title: SILK APPLES
 Categories: China, Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3    Apples
      2    Egg whites
      2 tb Flour
      2 tb Cornstarch
           Peanut oil for deep frying
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Honey
    1/3 c  Water
      1 tb Peanut oil
 
  Quite an experience to eat - the apples is still warm and soft, the
  top is crunchy and icy.  Great after a wok dinner.
  
  Peel the apples, core and cut into wedges about 1/2 inch thick. Whip
  egg whites until frothy.  Add flour and cornstarch and beat into a
  smooth batter. Heat the oil to 375F. Dip each apple wedge into egg
  white batter, place in hot oil and try, a few at a time, until crisp
  and brown. Place in a single layer on a warm service platter. Bring
  remaining ingredients to a boil in a saucepan and cook to a hard ball
  stage syrup; 280 F on candy thermometer.  Pour over apple wedges and
  serve at once, accompanied by a large crystal bowl of water
  containing lots of ice cubes. Each person picks up an apple wedge
  with a fork or small tongs and dips it into the ice water to
  crystallize the sugar and harden the top, which forms silk-like
  threads....hence the name. Serves 6.

 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 15 Servings
 
           -Cornbread Sausage Stuffing
           -  with Apples
     20 lb Turkey
      2    Oranges
    1/2 lb Butter
           -salt and pepper
           -paprika
      4 tb Corn oil
 
    1. Make the stuffing for the turkey.
    2. Wash the turkey well, inspecting for pinfeathers, and chop off
  the wing tips, reserving them for later use with giblets in gravy or
  stock. Dry the turkey inside and out with a kitchen towel.
    3. Slice oranges in half. Squeeze the juice all over the outside of
  the bird and rub into the cavity to refreshen. Salt and pepper the
  cavity to taste. Fill the turkey with the stuffing, not packing too
  tightly. Sew up the cavity or close with small trussing skewers.
    4. Rub the outside of the turkey all over with 1 1/2 sticks of
  softened butter and sprinkle generously with salt, pepper and
  paprika. Drape the turkey with cheesecloth.
    5. Place turkey, breast side up, on a rack in a roasting pan.
    6. Four to five hours before serving is scheduled, place the turkey
  in a preheated 325 oven.
    7. Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter with 4 tablespoons of
  corn oil in a saucepan. Lift the cheesecloth from the turkey and
  baste every 30 minutes, first with the butter and oil mixture and
  later with the turkey's own juices.*
    8. Roast for 3 to 4 hours or until the thigh juices run clear
  yellow when pricked with a skewer. There should be no traces of
  pinkness. The drumstick will move easily in the socket when the
  turkey is done.
    9. When the turkey is done, remove to a heated platter and cover
  with foil. The turkey should stand
       30    minutes before carving.
   10. Remove stuffing into a bowl. If there is any additional from the
  recipe, bake it in a covered cassarole in a 350 oven, covered with
  foil, for one half hour before serving.
   11. Serve the turkey on a large platter. Be sure you have sharp
  knives and a good carver among the group. Enjoy!
    *For a moist bird, frequent basting is essential, so don't forget!
  Baste every 30 minutes---breast and legs should be a lovely golden
  color.

      Title: SIMA - FINNISH MAY DAY DRINK - PRONOUNCED (SE
 Categories: Beverages
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
     10 qt Water, fresh pure
      2    Lemons
  2 1/2 c  Brown sugar
  2 1/2 c  White sugar
    1/3 c  Dark corn syrup, optional
    1/4 ts Dry yeast
           Raisins
 
  Shave the yellow peel from the lemons, cutting very thinly so that as
  little of the white underlayer as possible is attached. Set the yellow
  slices aside. Then peel the bitter white underlayer off and discard
  it. Slice the lemons into very thin slices. Place them into a
  container and cover them so they don't dry out. Boil the water in a
  large kettle. Remove it from the heat and stir in the yellow lemon
  peel, the sugars, and the syrup. When the sugars have dissolved,
  cover the kettle and let the contents cool to room temperature (25'C
  or 75'F). Then add the lemon slices and the yeast. Leave it to stand
  overnight. Place 4-5 raisins and a teaspoon of white sugar in the
  bottom of each of several clean bottles (wine or soda pop). Pour the
  sima into the bottles, straining it through a sieve to remove the
  lemon. Cap the bottle tightly. The sima will be ready to drink when
  the raisins rise to the top of the bottles, about 3-7 days depending
  on the temperature of the room where they are stored. Serve it well
  chilled.

      Title: SIMIT  (TURKISH CROISSANT WITH SESAME SEEDS)
 Categories: Breads, Turkish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      8 oz Flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 oz Margarine
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Milk, plus extra
      1 tb Water
      1    Egg
           Sesame seeds
 
  Put the flour and salt in a large bowl and make a hole in the middle.
  Into this hole pour the melted marg, olive oil, milk, water and
  beaten egg.
  
  Stirring from the outside into the middle gradually mix all the
  liquids into the flour until you have a dough. It will feel a bit
  oily, but is quite manageable. With floured hands shape the dough
  into rings about the diameter of a saucer and arrange them on a
  baking sheet. Brush them over with milk and sprinkle the sesame seeds
  on them. Bake them in a 400 degree oven for approx. 30 min. or until
  they are nicely browned.

      Title: SIMMERED APPLE
 Categories: Fruits, Family
      Yield: 1 Serving
 
      1    Apple, peeled and cored
      1 c  Wine, preferably
           -kosher lePesach
      2 tb Brown sugar
    1/2 ts Cinnamon, ground
           -(or more, to taste)
 
  Cut apple into at least sixteen pieces; arrange in small pan with
  wine and brown sugar.  (Unless wine is "sticky-sweet Kosher wine.")
  Simmer over low heat until "texture shows some evidence of cooking."
  Turn apples over periodically.  When both sides are done, remove from
  heat and dust with cinnamon.
  
  Beau's notes:
  
  *  One evening when, good ecumenist that I then was, I visited the
  Hillel Student Center (the occasion of my visit escapes me), someone
  had prepared a special Israeli concoction of apples in wine. Exactly
  how it was made, I did not quite figure out and I never asked, but I
  liked it and could tell that the person responsible had essentially
  somehow cooked or otherwise prepared apples in wine, very likely the
  sticky-sweet wine often used for Jewish ritual purposes. I thought it
  such a good thing that later I concocted my own dessert, very loosely
  based on the Israeli treat I had at the Hillel Center.  (If any
  Israeli, on reading this, accuses me of having maligned his or her
  national cuisine, I apologize deeply. However, I doubt this will be
  considered defamatory, only calorific. And perhaps, if the Israelis
  had nothing to do with this, they should wish they had. At least they
  inspired some shaygetz to come up with what follows.)
  
  ~D.C.B.
  
  *  This is good by itself (for one) or served as a topping for
  vanilla ice cream (two could eat it and be happy, but I could covet
  the whole thing).

 Categories: Desserts, Chocolate
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     25 g  Cornflour
    250 ml Milk
    100 g  Good dark chocolate
     50 g  Sugar
      3    Egg yolks
      5    Egg whites
      1 tb Extra sugar, caster if
           -available.
 
  It is a very light souffle, which doesn't sink *too* much when you
  dig into it. If any is left over it is still very fluffy and yummy
  when cold.
  
  Mix cornflour to a thin paste with some of the milk. Put the
  remaining milk in a saucepan with the chocolate and sugar, and stir
  over a gentle heat until the chocolate melts and the sugar dissolves.
  
  Add cornflour paste carefully and bring mixture to boil to thicken,
  stirring continuously, then remove from heat.
  
  Beat in egg yolks one by one, and leave mixture to cool slightly.
  (You can prepare in advance this far and if needed warm the mixture
  slightly before continuing.)
  
  Beat egg whites until they begin to stand in soft peaks, then add
  extra sugar and beat until the mixture stands in stiff peaks but is
  not dry. Fold into chocolate mixture gently.
  
  Immediately pour into greased and sugared 1 litre souffle dish (with a
  paper collar), and bake at 190 degrees celsius for 40 - 45 minutes.
  Serve immediately.

           -etc.)
 
  Mix the powdered sugar into the softened cream cheese a little (2/3
  cup) at a time, making sure it is well blended after every addition.
  
  Melt the chocolate in a double boiler and add it to the cream cheese
  mixture along with the vanilla. Mix well. Chill for a couple hours.
  Roll mix into one inch balls, then roll them in a topping. Chill.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Easy-to-make candies with chocolate and cream cheese -- Here's a
  good recipe for lazy chocolate freaks. They're not as good as the
  ones you buy in good candy stores, but they're still yummy.
  
  *  If you're adventurous, try substituting the liqueur of your choice
  for the vanilla.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 2 hours chilling, 20 minutes rolling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.
