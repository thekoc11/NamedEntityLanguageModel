  Mix all ingredients and form into smooth dough-and roll it to 1/8 inch
  thickness OR use WONTON wrappers I have had excellent results. Fill with
  anything your heartdesires-my favorite is potato. All you do is make mashed
  potatoes, season them to taste, and let them cool. You may also use
  kasha-anything! Moisten the edges and fold over the filling, and press
  edges together. Place in a pan greased with hot oil and bake in a 350 oven
  until brown and crisp. I promise, you will come out with a product similar
  to the famous Mrs. Stahl's of Brooklyn... Lesleigh Hershkowitz FROM:

      Yield: 32 servings
 
-------------------------------FOR THE DOUGH-------------------------------
    1/2 lb Unsalted butter                     2 c  Flour; all purpose
      8 oz Cream cheese; softened        

-----------------------------RAISIN NUT FILLING-----------------------------
    1/2 c  Sugar                               1 c  Almonds;ground/or other nuts
    1/2 c  Seedless raisins;or currants      1/4 c  Sugar; for topping
      1 ts Cinnamon                      

---------------------------STRAWBERRY JAM FILLING---------------------------
    1/2 c  Almonds; ground                   1/4 c  Sugar; for topping
    1/2 c  Strawberry jam;or other jam    
 
  Cream the butter and cream cheese together. Beat in the flour, a little at
  a time. Knead the dough lightly until all the flour is incorporated.
  Refrigerate at least 1 hour. Divide the dough into two portions. Prepare
  one of the fillings by combining the ingredients except the sugar for the
  topping, and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Roll out a portion
  of the dough in a circle about 1/16" thick. With a knife or pastry wheel,
  cut the pastry into 16 pie-shaped wedges. If the dough is sticky, dust it
  with a little flour. Sprinkle or spread the filling on the wedge. Beginning
  at the wide edge, roll the dough up toward the point. Place on an ungreased
  cookie sheet and carefully sprinkle with a tiny bit of the reserved sugar.
  Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Bake 15 to 18 minutes, or
  until golden Notes: The dough for this cookie will literally melt in your
  hands if not worked very quickly, and kept as cold as possible! I freeze a
  marble pastry board before I begin to make these and use a marble pin for
  rolling the dough. If you do not have this equipment, ice down the area you
  aare going to work on. When rolling the dough, it is wise to place a sheet
  of waxed paper over the board. If the dough gets too sticky to work, put it
  back in the fridge for a while, then continue. This recipe is basically the
  recipe in The Jewish Holiday Kitchen, by Joan Nathan. I have used various
  flavors of jam or preserves, even Simply Fruit in it, and the cookies
  disappear like magic. If I bake them for guests, I make at least two
  recipes, or my sweet-tooth husband will eat them all before the company
  arrives. (and I help him! <G>) Barb Day

           Pinch salt                          6 tb Unsalted butter; (3/4 stick)
           Pinch pepper                   
 
  * Peeled, seeded, and coarsely chopped 1. TO MAKE THE FILLING: In a medium
  skillet, heat the butter over medium heat until melted. Add the shallot and
  saute` until soft; about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and saute` another 2
  minutes.  Add the zucchini and continue to saute` for 2 minutes. 2.
   Add the tomato and cook over high heat for 2 minutes to evaporate any
  excess liquid from the tomato.  Add the salt, pepper, and basil and mix
  well.  Taste for seasoning. Cover to keep warm. 3. TO PREPARE EACH
  OMELETTE: Whisk 2 to 3 eggs with ta pinch of salt, a pinch of pepper, and
  1/2 teaspoon club soda until smooth. 4. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in an
  8-inch omelette pan or skillet over medium heat until it begins to sizzle.
  5. Pour in the egg mixture and stir it in the center of the pan with the
  flat side of a fork. With the prongs of the fork, lift the edges on the
  omelette so any uncooked mixture runs to the edge of the pan. Vigorously
  slide the pan back and forth over the heat until the omelette begins to
  slip around freely. 6. When the omelette is lightly cooked but still creamy
  in the center, spoon about 2 tablespoons of the filling over the half of
  the omelette closer to the pan's handle. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the
  Parmesan cheese over the filling. 7. Quickly jerk the pan toward you with
  the handle so that the other half of the omelette flips over on top of the
  filling. Slide the folded omelette onto a serving dish. Serve immediately
  or keep warm in a low oven while preparing the remaining omelettes. ADVANCE
  PREPARATION: The filling may be prepared 1 day in advance without the basil
  and refrigerated.  Remove it from the refrigerator 1/2 hour before using,
  add the basil and gently reheat. Source: The Taste Of Summer

  by apple sauce. Adapted from Alan Harding, Nosmo King, New York Potato
  pancakes with a horseradish punch are great way to work spring into your
  menu. Fans of the tear-inducing fumes that rise from freshly grated
  horseradish can tell you how they clear your head. What a culinary way to
  drive out wintery thoughts as we move into the new season! Fresh
  horseradish is rich in vitamin C and volatile oils. These oils are the
  cause of its pungent bite. This bite gives an interesting flavor-lift to
  potato pancakes. Alan Harding, chef at Nosmo King restaurant in New York,
  is serving spring latkes, or pancakes, made from a blend of grated celery
  root, potato, horseradish and onion. Since both celery root and horseradish
  are bitter, I find that using 1 or the other makes pancakes with more
  balanced flavor. Also, their texture is more velvety. Harding serves his
  crunchy, fried latkes on top of a crisp green salad. It's a nice change
  from croutons. They also make a zesty accompaniment to roast leg of spring
  lamb or roast beef.

      Title: Barley Risotto with Shrimp Eggplant
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      7 tb Olive oil                           3    Japanese eggplant
      1    Shallot; minced                    10    Lg shrimp; peeled cut 4 piec
      2 c  Pearl barley                      1/4 c  Grated pecorino cheese
      8 c  Vegetable stock                
 
  In a large saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat. Add
  shallot and cook, stirring, until translucent. Add barley; stir to coat
  with the oil. Reduce heat to medium. Continue cooking barley, stirring
  occasionally, for 2-3 minutes; take care not to let it brown. While barley
  is cooking, bring vegetable stock to a boil. Add vegetable stock to barley,
  a cup at time. Cook, stirring frequently, until liquid is almost absorbed
  before adding more liquid. Keep adding liquid, stirring frequently until
  barley pearls are al dente, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cut eggplant into
  1/2-inch cubes. Heat 4 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over
  medium-high heat. Saute eggplant, stirring frequently, until soft, about 12
  minutes. Set aside. Using skillet in which eggplant was cooked, add
  remaining tablespoon of oil. Saute shrimp until pink. When barley is done,
  stir in eggplant and shrimp. Add grated pecorino cheese. Serve. Source:
  Odette Fada, Rex Il Restaurante, Los Angeles Fada's barley risotto is easy
  to make. It's a great way to offer the luxury of shellfish. Because the
  shrimp is cut into pieces, you only a half-pound of it to make risotto for
  6-8 people. Despite the shrimp, this dish is predominantly grain. It's high
  in complex carbohydrates and fiber, and low in fat. But it's so exciting
  that one hesitates to label it with the stigma of "healthy eating." Best of
  all, here's a dish that fits the proverbial champagne taste on a beer
  budget; in total, ingredients for this risotto cost about $10. Add a salad
  and a cheese course and you can feed a small dinner party for about $5 a
  head.

      1 ts Ground coriander                  1/2 ts Sugar
 
  This is a fairly simple Eggplant dish made with yogurt. If you aren't crazy
  about eggplant, you can adapt this to use zucchini or other squash; just
  watch the cooking times! Roast the eggplant in a 350F oven for 1 hour or
  until tender. When cool, peel and cut into cubes. Brown the onion in 2 Tbsp
  of the oil. Add ginger, garlic, coriander, cayenne, turmeric, cumin and
  salt. Fry for several minutes. Add the remaining 2 tbsp oil and the
  eggplant cubes. Cook about 5 minutes. Just before serving, stir in the
  yogurt and sugar. Serve with (but not necessarily ON) basmati rice.

      1 lb Green beans, ends trimmed           1 tb Walnut or olive oil
      2    Cloves garlic, minced             1/8 ts Salt (optional)
      1 tb Red-wine vinegar                  1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
 
  I tried this recipe from Jane Brody's "Good Food Gourmet" for Thanksgiving
  last year and my family really loved it! Steam beans for 5 to 7 minutes or
  until tender crisp. Rinse briefly under cold water to preserve color, but
  do not chill. Cover and keep warm. In a large bowl, combine garlic and
  remaining ingredients. Add warm green beans and toss until well coated. If
  desired, you can reheat in microwave before serving. If you don't want such
  a strong flavor of garlic, simmer the unpeeled cloves of garlic in a cup of
  water for 5 minutes before peeling and mincing. I don't think the original
  recipe is too strong though.

      Title: Pressed Duck with Sweet and Sour Plum Sauce
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      5 lb Long Island duck, cleaned                Boiling water
      1 tb Chinese five-spice powder                Sweet and sour plum sauce
      1 ts Salt                                     Oil for deep frying
      1 c  Water chestnut powder                    Crushed toasted almonds
 
      Place duck in large kettle or Dutch oven with enough boiling water to
  cover.  Add spices and salt and simmer covered until tender, about 1 to 1
  1/4 hours. Remove duck from liquid and let cool.
      Remove meat from bones and discard skin.  Pour chestnut powder into
  small baking pan (an 8-inch aluminum pan works well; powder should be 1/2
  to 1/4 inch deep). Press meat into powder. Cover and steam 30 minutes, or
  until powder has gelatinized into thick, heavy crust. Remove from steamer
  and let cool.
    Cover and chill until ready to complete.      About 30 minutes before
  serving time, prepare sweet and sour plum sauce; set aside and keep warm.
  Warm a serving platter in low oven. Preheat oil in deep fryer to 375 F.
  Slice duck into bite-size chunks and fry quickly in batches until crisp and
  browned.  Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Repeat until
  cooking is completed. Serve immediately with sweet and sour plum sauce
  topped with nuts. From Bon Appetit's "Oriental Favorites."

  Hi Everyone: I really like "one pot" recipes and this one from the LA
  Times, issued 3/l2/92 really fits that for me. Now, if I could just get rid
  of the "pot" I carry around my waist, we would be in business!
  :) :) This recipe is by Fatima Lakhani, author of "Indian Recipes for a
  Healthy Heart." Combine tomatoes, peas, yogurt, garlic, ginger, coriander,
  cumin, garam masala, l/2 tsp. salt, and turmeric in bowl. Heat canola oil
  in large saucepan.  Add onion, green chiles, cinnamon sticks, peppercorns
  and cumin seeds and saute until onion starts to turn golden. Add tomato
  mixture and stir. Cover and cook over medium heat l0 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.  Add water, remaining 3/4 tsp. salt, potatoes and cilantro.
  Stir well, cover and bring to boil. Add rice, stir gently and cook,
  covered, until almost all the water has been absorbed, about l0 minutes.
  Reduce heat to low and cook l0 to l5 minutes, or until rice is tender.

      Title: Czech Dumplings
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 pk Yeast                               1    Egg
      1 ts Sugar                             1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Milk; scalded and cooled        3 1/2 c  Flour
      1 c  Milk; warm                          3    Slices white bread; cubed
 
  There are a number of different kinds of dumplings in the Czech cuisine,
  but if you are serving a pork roast with sauerkraut, I recommend bread
  dumplings. Make sure you use the drippings from the roast to make gravy for
  these! Mix the first three ingredients, let stand for 10 minutes. Mix the
  warm milk, egg, salt, yeast mixture and flour. Add the bread cubes. Knead
  the resulting dough just as you would when making bread. Let the dough rest
  in a warm place to rise. It should double in about 2 hours. Knead again;
  divide into 3 long rolls, each about 1 1/2 " thick. Let rise another 1/2
  hour. Drop the rolls of dough, one at a time, into a large kettle of
  boiling water. Boil gently for about 15 minutes. Remove with slotted spoons
  and place on a buttered platter. Keep warm. When ready to serve, slice the
  rolls into individual slices by using a length of thread. Loop it around
  one dumpling and pull tight to slice off a piece about 2" thick. (This is
  the fun part! You can get pretty good at this garrotting if you practice!!)
  You should end up with about 2 dozen slices. My cookbook says, "These
  freeze well - steam before serving." (I've never tried that!!) If you would
  prefer potato dumplings to these, just say so. The only problem with them
  is they sometimes get a bit "slimy" or mushy. I like them that way, but
  they don't look as presentable as the bread dumplings.

-------------------------------FOR THE CRUST-------------------------------
    3/4 lb Crisco                              5    Egg yolks
  2 1/2 c  Flour                               2 tb Or 3 of sugar

------------------------------FOR THE FILLING------------------------------
      3 lb Ricotta                             1    Grated rind of 1 or more
      7    Whole eggs                               Lemons
      5    Extra whites                        1 tb Vanilla
    1/2 c  Sugar or more                       2 tb Liqueur
 
  Crust:  Mix Crisco shortening with flour, cutting it in with pastry blender
  or two knives until you get beads like small peass. Mix in the egg yolks
  and sugar. Knead a little bit to get it to hang together. Add more flour if
  you have to. Don't play with it! Put in the refrigerator while you do the
  rest. FILLING: A lot depends on the ricotta here. Supermarket ricotta must
  be drained of whey. Italian cheese stores and delis throughout the city
  (Philly) especially at this season, sell handmade ricotta, which makes a
  denser and creamier cake. It coasts about $2.00 more for 3 lbs. "I use Tia
  Maria, Grand Marnier, Amaretto, whatever liqueur I feel like depending on
  my many moods", says Nanny Giordano. Beat up the eggs good with sugar,mix
  in lemon, vanilla and liqueur, then mix with cheese." Beat it up nice,
  don't go" Johanna flings her hands around aimlessly." GET IT Smooth". Use a
  deep ovenproof glass.I used a 2" deep,13" oval dish from France,Arcuisine
  d'Arcopal. Nanny doesn't bother, but I rubbed the surface with a little
  shortening to prevent sticking. Take dough from refrigerator. "Can you roll
  it out? Yes but don't bother "Take pieces in your hands and plaster the
  inside of the dish, more or less lumpily smooth. Pour in filling. Bake in a
  slow oven, at 325 deg. "until it's done. About 1 hour. It'll set and puff.
  You'll see. "I made this recipe. I saw. It works.You may have more or less
  chese left over,depending on your baking dish and your ricotta.But it will
  work... This is the recipe of Johanna Guarracino as told to Jim Quinn of
  the Inqir.

  Twists Is anyone out there like me? I love the Bake-off cookbooks published
  every year after the contest is over. This year's had some great recipes in
  it and I will post two for those who didnt get the book. This on is from
  Linda Sue Burlingame AND IS WONDERFUL . Heat oven to 350, grease 13x9 pan:
  sprinkle with cornmeal. Unroll dough. Press into bottom and 1/4 inch up
  sides of pan to form crust; firmly press perforations to seal. Bake for
  14-19 minutes or until golden brown. Remove. Increase oven temp. to 400.
  Meanwhile in small bowl mash beans with fork, stir in reserved bean liquid
  and chili powder, mix well. Spread evenly over baked crust. Top with
  mushrooms, tomatoes and jalapeno pepper slices. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake
  at 400 for 5 to 10 minutes or until cheese melts. Cut squares and top each
  with sour cream, green onions and sliced olives. Serves 6 or makes 12
  appetizers.

 Categories: Spreads
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/4 c  Prepared horseradish              1/2 c  Butter
 
  Blend together and use as a spread for canapes. Garnish as desired. The
  Int'l Horseradish Festival is held in Collinsville, IL (about 10 miles east
  of St. Louis, MO) every May. Sixy percent of the worlds horseradish is
  grown there. It's pretty easy to grow. Why is it Hot? Highly volatile oils
  are released by enzyme activity when the root cells are crushed. To grind:
  Wash & peel dice in small cubes. Process in a blender with enough cold
  water to just cover.  Add 2-3 T. white vinegar ane 1/2 t. salt. Process no
  more than half a blender jar. The time you add the vinegar is critical as
  this determines how hot it will be. If you like it hot wait up to 3 minutes
  to add the vinegar as this stops the emzymatic action.

  all stuffing ingredients in a 4 qt. microwave-safe bowl. Stir well to
  blend. 2. Cook, uncovered, on high for 20 minutes or until thickened (note:
  stuffing will turn into a black, tar-like mass ~- this is o.k.!). Cool to
  room temperature.  Drain stuffing in a metal colander over a deep bowl to
  catch drippings. While draining, proceed with rest of dish. 3. TO MAKE
  ROAST: Mix the garlic, cumin, cayenne, ketchup, soy sauce, and
  worcestershire sauce.  Add drainings from stuffing; mix well. Using a
  spoon, stuff the stuffing into the pocket of the pork. Close the open end
  of the pocket with tooth picks or poultry skewers. 4. Place the pork in a
  foil-lined roasting dish. Pour 1 cup of the sauce over the pork, covering
  it completely.  Roast in a preheat 350 F. oven for about 45 minutes,
  basting 2 times and using half of the remaining sauce to baste each time.
  Remove roast from pan. Cover with aluminum foil and let it stand for about
  15 minutes before you slice it.  Heat pan drippings and sauce and serve
  along side of pork.

      Title: Cabbage Rolls
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Large head of cabbage              28 oz Tomatoes
      3    Bay leaves                               Salt
      2 lb Lean ground beef (or beef &              Pepper
      2    Large onions; chopped                    Oregano
      1    Large bell pepper; chopped               Basil
      3    Cloves garlic; minced                    Thyme
     12 oz Tomato sauce                       16 oz Stewed tomatoes
 
  Separate cabbage leaves and steam over boiling water to which the bay
  leaves have been added.  Steam the leaves just long enough to soften so
  that they can be easily rolled. Cool and remove hard veins from leaves. For
  stuffing, saute onions, pepper and garlic in a little oil until just
  tender.  In a separate pan, saute meat until done. Add 2/3 of the onion mix
  to the meat and the other ingredients (except the 16 oz. can of stewed
  tomatoes). Cook and stir until mixture is reduced and rather thick. Stuff
  each cabbage leaf with about 1/4 cup of meat mixture and roll tightly. (You
  may have to use 2 leaves if they aren't very big.) Place rolls in oiled pan
  that is small enough to hold the rolls in shape. Mix the remaining can of
  stewed tomatoes with the onion mix and add additional seasonings. I usually
  simmer this for a few minutes and check the flavor. Pour this sauce over
  the rolls. Cover & bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. Mrs. Panno's recipe
  calls for the addition of day old bread, moistened and squeezed dry. I omit
  the bread since this is more like a spaghetti sauce than meat loaf mix. I
  usually serve these with a salad, crusty bread and buttered potatoes (that
  part's not Italian,but the potatoes go very well with it.) Sorry that there
  are no specific measurements on the seasonings, but I am usually very
  heavy-handed with the garlic, oregano & basil. This recipe can also be made
  in a casserole form to serve a crowd, I've layered chopped
  cabbage,meat,cabbage & sauce in a casserole and it works fine. If you do it
  this way you can feed an army! I'm looking forward to trying the soup your
  way, but, lets face it, it's almost 90 today. It'll be a while before I
  make split pea soup again. Judy/Sweatin' in Richmond*TX

  This is a hearty sweet and sour meat soup that can be used as a main dish.
  Bubbies  measurements were never exact. You need to taste. Put meat and
  bones in a 8 or 12 qt stock pot. Put in cans of tomato, cover with water
  and bring to a boil. In the meantime, get your veggies ready. Slice beets
  and carrots, others go in whole. When stock boils, skim off top. Put in
  beets, carrots, garlic, and other veggies. Turn heat down to a simmer and
  keep lid on askew. After about an hour, put in garlic and sugar.
   I have used Sweet and Low. Amounts are a matter of preference. It should
  have a rich, sweet and sour taste. I break up the meat and stir it back
  into the soup before serving. NOTE: Sometimes I add some tomato paste; 2 or
  3 T for body; Enjoy!!! * Elaine/Framingham * Westboro 05/04/92 07:34 am

  occasionally. Remove ribs from sauce and place in a single layer in a
  shallow baking pan. Skim fat from sauce and baste meat with some of the
  sauce. Bake at 350 for 30 minutes or until tender, occasionally turning and
  basting with remaining sauce. Broil ribs for about 5 minutes to finish
  browning. Note: Par-boiled ribs can be grilled on the barbecue, but baste
  with sauce only during the last 5 minutes. I usually serve these ribs with
  steamed rice and a leafy salad. I hope you enjoy these ribs as much as I
  do. JOYCE in L.A.

      2 tb Soy sauce                       1 1/2 ts Cornstarch**
      1 ts Sugar                               3 tb Stock**
 
  *This dish originally used 1 lb. of flank steak which was cut against the
  grain into thin slices and then marinated same as the tofu. Sometimes I
  make it with steak or tofu or a mixture of both. In addition, I
  occasionally add a small bok choy which is first blanched and then cooled.
  If other vegetables are added, increase the cornstarch mixture to three
  times what is listed. Recipe can be doubled and comes out fine. Mix the
  cornstarch with the soup stock and have ready until needed. Get tofu ready
  according to your favorite methods. I usually slice it lengthwise in
  half-inch blocks, put paper towels over and under it, and press with
  telephone book to get out excess water. I also like to use tofu after it
  has been frozen. Mix together the sherry, salt, pepper, soy sauce, sugar
  and 1 1/2 tsp. of the oil in a shallow dish. Add the tofu or steak shreds
  and leave to marinate for 15 minutes. Heat 2 1/2 tablespoons of the
  remaining oil in a wok or pan over high heat. Add the ginger and onion and
  stir-fry for 1 1/2 minutes (about). Remove onions, place in a colander, and
  let drain. You can use the oil left in pan if it is enough. Heat wok again.
  When it is very hot, add the tofu or steak and garlic. Stir-fry the tofu or
  steak and garlic in the oil for until brown. Mix in the onion and ginger
  and stir-fry for a minute. Stir in the cornstarch mixture and cook,
  stirring for about 30 seconds or until thickened. From "The Encyclopaedia
  of Chinese Cooking". Enjoy! ~Karen- cookin' in Brick, NJ 05/05 08:38 pm

  (1to2) lb lava (porous) rock and some hard wood. Eucalyptis,Oak,etc. Layer
  wood and rock to make huge mound in the pit and set on fire about 3AM.
  Coals and white hot rocks will be ready about 7. check each hour.
  Salt/Pepper pig inside and out; rub hard. pig should be room temperature.
  Cover rock/embers with wet banana leaves - 3 to 6 layers. Possible to use
  seaweed, corn stalk leaves.  Cover this with layers of wet burlap sacks.
  start at outside and layer like shingles on a roof to the middle. Put pit
  on a small section of small wire fence section like you keep chicks in.
  With tongs put several hot rocks in pig cavity near thickest part of meat.
  Spread one layer banana leaves on burlap and place pig in the middle of the
  pit. (encased in the wire). Banana leaves over the pig and then cover with
  burlap again starting from outside and like roof shingles to the middle.
  Shovel the dirt back in the pit completely covering. Don't leave any holes.
  Sprinkle lightly with garden hose. Steam will escape but keep well covered.
  About 4 or 5 in the afternoon it will be done. Also fun to put in a few
  chickens/whole fish/goats all wrapped tightly in foil. Very carefully
  shovel dirt from top of pit. When the middle burlap is seen start rolling
  it back toward the sides and ends. Pig will be thoroughly cooked with meat

  COOKING Feta and Ricotta Cheese Fondue
  
  Melt the butter in a heavy 8-inch skillet or a 1 quart saucepan over
  low-heat. Add the feta and ricotta cheese, and pepper. Cook, stirring
  constantly, and mashing the cheeses slightly, until they soften and begin
  to bubble - about 5 minutes.
  
  Stir in lemon juice, and garnish with the parsley if desired. Serve at
  once; as the fondue cools, it loses flavor. VARIATIONS: Substitute Fontina
  cheese for the Feta Cheese or you can substitute cottage cheese for the
  ricotta. You can make both of these substitutions.

      1 tb Olive oil                         1/2 ts Ground black pepper
 
  PLACE BEANS IN A POT with enough water to barely cover, cover the pot and
  cook over low heat until beans are barely soft, about 2 hours. Add water to
  keep the beans just covered as necessary. When beans are done, remove from
  heat, drain and set aside. Meanwhile, cut the stems out of fresh tomatoes
  and plunge them into boiling water for barely 1 minute, or until skins
  crack. Remove from water, peel the tomatoes, cut them in half crosswise and
  squeeze out the seeds. If using canned whole tomatoes, cut them in half and
  squeeze out seeds. Cut each tomato half in quarters and set aside. Cook
  pasta until barely soft according to the manufacturer's directions. Drain
  and mix with the beans. Lay the chard leaves on a work surface and cut out
  the center stem. Roughly chop the leaves and thinly slice the stems. Set
  aside.
  
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Combine oil and sausages in a Dutch oven, place over
  medium heat and cook 3 minutes. Pour off the fat, add the garlic and cook,
  stirring, another minute. Add the tomatoes, beans and pasta, wine, oregano,
  chard stems, salt and pepper. Cover and place in the oven for 20 minutes.
  When it's time to get dinner on the table, add chopped chard to the
  casserole. If the casserole appears dry, add up to 1 cup water. Replace in
  the oven for 5 minutes. Serve piping hot from the oven and offer grated
  cheese.

  another 15-to-20 minutes, or until just barely cooked at the bone. While
  the salmon is baking, prepare the sauce. In a small saucepan over medium
  heat, combine shallots, remaining wine, vinegar and salt. Cook until the
  mixture is almost dry. Remove from heat and whisk in remaining butter.
  Arrange the salmon on a large serving platter and offer the sauce on the
  side.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 c  Feta cheese, drained,                    Flour
           Crumbled, and packed into           1    Egg, beaten
           The measuring cup                   6    Bay leaves
    1/2 c  Unbleached, all-purpose             2 tb Honey
 
     1) Put the cheese into a medium sized mixing bowl. Mash well with the
  fingers until it becomes a smooth, lumpless paste. Add the flour and mix
  well with the fingers. Add the beaten egg and mix well. The dough will be
  rather sticky.
  
     2) Divide the dough into two equal parts, then form two round, flat, 1/2
  inch thick loaves.  Lay each on three bay leaves set on a greased baking
  sheet, and bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 1 to 1-1/2 hours, or
  until cooked through.
  
     3) Remove the loaves from the oven, spread the tops with the honey, and

      Title: Cato's Grape Bread
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 c  Unbleached, all-purpose             1 ts Cumin seed, ground
           Flour                               1 ts Anise, ground
    1/2 c  Lard, shortening, or butter     1 1/2 c  Grape juice, purple or white
           Melted and cooled                   1 pk Dry yeast
    1/4 c  Feta cheese, crumbled and           8    Bay leaves
           Mashed into a paste            
 
     1) Place the flour, lard, mashed cheese, ground cumin and anise, and
  yeast in a large mixing bowl. Blend well. Add the grape juice and mix the
  dough well for 2-3 minutes until all the grape juice is absorbed and evenly
  distributed.  The dough will be damp and sticky, but no internal dry areas
  should appear by the end of the mixing. If they do, mix a few minutes more
  or add a little more grape juice and mix again.
  
     2) Let the dough rest 5 minutes.  Now sprinkle 1 or 2 tbsp. flour over
  the dough and knead, either in the bowl or on a lightly floured surface for
  5-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic and only slightly
  sticky.  Add more flour if needed.  Let the dough rest 2 minutes.
  
     3) The dough should now be very smooth and easy to handle. Knead 30
  seconds more, return the dough to the bowl, cover the bowl with a dish
  towel or large plate, and let rise at room temperature for at least 3
  hours.
  
     4) Sprinkle top with flour, punch down, and form the dough into 4
  rectangular loaves (4 in. by 2 in. by 2-1/2 in.). Place two bay leaves on
  the bottom of each loaf, and lay them, leaf side down, on a greased cookie
  sheet.  Cover with a towel and let rise for 1 hour, until well risen.
  
     5) Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 35 minutes, until the loaves
  are brown on top and make a hollow sound when tapped on the bottom. Serve
  when cool. NOTE: To make these breads without leavening, omit the yeast,
  knead the dough thoroughly, then bake at 350 degrees for about 2 hours.
  They will be chewy and moist, and very foreign to our taste. The Romans
  thought unleaven bread was manlier and much better for the digestion.

  and the remaining green ingredients into a blender and blend well. Transfer
  to a mixing bowl, and add the cheese and ground pepper. Form into a ball.
  Add the vinegar and oil in sparing amounts.

  add chopped onion. Saute for 5 minutes and add garlic, ginger and 2 of the
  peppers. Saute for another 5 minutes. Add the stock, simmer for 10 minutes
  and remove from heat.
   While the stock and vegetables are simmering, cut the Avocados in half and
  seed and peel them. Chop the Avocados, toss them with the juice of 1 lime
  and place about half the Avocado in a blender container. Add hot stock and
  vegetables until container is about 3/4 full and process until the mixture
  is smooth and liquid. Chill the soup thoroughly, preferably for several
  hours.
   To make the cilantro cream, stir the sour cream and half-and-half
  together, add the chopped cilantro, the remaining chili pepper, the ground
  coriander and salt to taste. Chill until you are ready to use it.
   Cut the radishes in small julienne and toss with the walnut oil or the
  remaining olive oil, the juice of 1/2 lime and salt to taste. Chill until
  you are ready to use them.
   Taste the chilled soup and add salt and more lime juice to taste. Ladle it
  into chilled soup bowls. Top each serving with a tablespoon of cilantro
  cream and a tablespoon of julienned radishes.
  
  Variation This soup is also delicious when served hot and is an ideal
  opening to a hearty Mexican meal.

      5 c  Sifted all purpose flour            1 c  Warm water (105 - 1150F)
      2 c  Sugar                               1    Egg, slightly beaten
           Salt                              1/2 c  Melted butter
      3 tb Butter OR oil                       2 ts Ground cinnamon
      1    Active dry yeast (use 2             1 ts Anise extract OR
           Packages if time is short)        1/4 c  Aniseeds
 
     1.  Sift flour, 1 cup sugar adn salt together.  Cut in the butter until
  the mixture resembles coarse meal. If using oil, stir oil into liquid
  ingredients after adding the egg.
  
     2.  Dissolve yeast in warm water, stir vigorously, and allow to ferment
  for 5 to 10 minutes.  Then add the egg and anise extract or aniseeds.
  
     3.  Add a small quantity of the flour mixture to the yeast and beat
  until thoroughly blended.  Let stand for a few minutes, or until dough
  becomes light and airy.
  
     4.  Add the rest of the flour mixture, adding more flour if necessary to
  make a stiff dough.  Knead on a lightly floured board until satiny.
  
     5.  Butter the top of the dough, cover with wax paper and let rise until
  doubled.
  
     6.  When the bread has risen, punch it down, and let it rise until
  doubled again.
  
     7.  Knead the dough slightly, then form into balls the size of an
  orange.  With a rolling pin, flatten to 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick.
  
     8.  Prepare a topping by mixing together the melted butter, remaining 1
  cup sugar and the cinnamon. Spread topping on all sides of the rolls.
  
     9.  Let rolls rise until light and about doubled in size. When nearly
  doubled, preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Bake in a preheated oven for 20 to
  25 minutes, or until golden. Slice thinly and butter generously with soft
  butter. Arrange slices on a platter as desired. They will keep for 2 to 3
  days at room temperature when well wrapped.
  
  Maximum recommended freezer storage:  3 months

  Boil wrapper. Remove from heat and pour in 1 1/2 cup flour and beat until
  it forms a ball.  Divide into 1 1/4 inch balls and roll each until paper
  thin.  Spoon 1 tbls. mixture into each wrapper, fold and seal. Arrange in
  steamer and steam 30 minutes.
  
       Again some expanation... these can be made with much thicker wrappers
  (the ones the street vendors sell are more like 1/2 to 1 inch thick) and
  the filling can be just about anything. I have done these with leftover
  meat and a few vegetables ... such as mushrooms, celery etc.

           Mushrooms                       1 1/2 ts Light soy sauce
      6 oz Shrimp, shelled & deveined          2 ts Cornstarch
      1 ts Salt                                2 tb Chicken stock
  1 1/2 tb Peanut oil                          2 tb Coarsely chopped fresh
      6 oz Ground pork butt                         Coriander leaves
    1/4 c  Finely diced bamboo shoots          1    Oil
    1/4 c  Finely diced water                       Wheat Starch Wrappers
           Chestnuts, preferably fresh              (see recipe)
      2    Green onions, chopped                    Light soy sauce, for
      2 ts Sugar                                    Dipping
    1/4 ts White pepper                             Chinese mustard, for
      1 tb Shao Hsing rice wine or dry              Dipping
 
  can be prepared entirely in advance and reheated a few minutes before
  serving.  The wheat starch wrappers have an interesting chewy texture, a
  unique translucent appearance and are absorbent of flavors. Roll out the
  wrappers as thin as possible; otherwise they come out rubbery.
  
       Cover mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes or until soft and
  pliable.  Remove and squeeze out excess water from the mushrooms. Cut off
  the stems at the base and discard them. Finely mince the caps.
  
       Toss the shrimp with salt and let them stand 10 minutes. Rinse well
  with cold water, pat dry thoroughly. Coarsely mince.
  
       Preheat a wok or skillet. when hot, add the peanut oil. over medium-
  high heat, add the mushrooms, shrimps, pork butt, bamboo shoots, water
  chestnuts, and half the green onions; stir-fry until the pork turns white.
  Season with the sugar, white pepper, wine and soy sauce. Combine the
  cornstarch and chicken stock in a small bowl and mix until smooth; pour
  into wok. Stir fry for 1 minute longer. Remove the mixture to a shallow
  plate and mix in the remaining green onion and coriander. Allow the filling
  to cool, then refrigerate it until needed.
  
  Makes almost 2 cups of filling.
  
       Prepare the Wheat Starch Wrapper dough.  Pinch off 1-inch balls of
  dough.  Lightly oil the ball and flatten it into a thin 3 1/2-inch circle.
  An oiled Chinese cleaver is traditionally used; however, a tortilla press
  or a rolling pin works.  Put 1 large teaspoon of filling in the center of
  the circle.  Fold it in half and pinch the edges to seal the filling
  inside.  Repeat with remaining dough and filling.
  
       Place dumplings without touching each other on a lightly oiled bamboo
  steamer (or a heat resistant plate). Steam over boiling water for 3
  minutes. Serve hot, dipped in light soy sauce and Chinese mustard. Serve
  with Chinese Mustard, for dipping.
  
  Makes 2 1/2 dozen dumplings.

      Title: Imperial Coconut Flan
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 c  Milk                                     Pinch   salt
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar                         Flan mold coated with
      1    Small coconut                            Caramel
      5    Small eggs, separated          
 
       Preheat the oven to 450F.
  
       Place the sugar and milk in a heavy saucepan and melt the sugar over
  low heat, then raise the heat and boil the mixture briskly. Take care that
  it does not boil over. As soon as the mixture begins to thicken, stir it so
  that it does not stick to the bottom of the pan. After about 30 minutes it
  should be the consistency of thin condensed milk and has been reduced to 1
  cup.  See Note.
  
       Pierce holes through two of the "eyes" of the coconut and drain the
  water from it.  Set the water aside.
  
       Put the whole coconut into the oven for about 8 minutes. Crack it
  open; the flesh should come away quite easily from the shell.
  
       Pare the brown skin from the coconut flesh with a potato peeler. Grate
  the coconut finely.  You will need 2 1/4 cups, loosely packed, for the
  flan.
  
       Add the grated coconut to the reserved coconut water and boil it for
  about 5 minutes, stirring it constantly.
  
       Add the "condensed" milk and continue cooking for another 5 minutes.
  Set the mixture aside to cool.
  
       Beat the egg yolks together until they are creamy and stir them well
  into the coconut mixture.
  
       Beat the egg whites until they are frothy, add the salt and continue
  beating until they are stiff. Fold them into the mixture.
  
       Pour the mixture into the prepared mold.  Cover the mold with a
  well-greased lid and place into a water bath.
  
       Cook the flan on the lowest shelf of the oven for about 1 1/2 hours,
  then test to see if it is done. When it is done, set it aside to cool.
  
  Makes 6 servings.
  
  NOTES:
       Of course, you can substitute1 cup of lightly thinned canned,
  sweetened condensed milk for the milk and sugar and substitute pre-grated
  but unsweetened coconut. Use milk instead of coconut water; the flavor will
  just not be quite as good.
  
       Do not think you have done something wrong when you see that the
  coconut and custard have separated. That is how it is meant to be. The
  caramel will nearly all have been absorbed by the spongy layer of coconut.
  
       If you are using fresh coconut there will almost certainly be some
  left over.  It will keep perfectly well if frozen.
  
       To test to see if the flan is cooked through, insert the blade of a
  knife or a skewer well into the flan. The knife should come out clean. Take
  care not to pierce the flan at the bottom or it will spoil the appearance
  of the top when it is unmolded.

      1    Egg, large; &                       1 ts -Water
 
   In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment blend
  the flour, the sugar, the baking powder, and the salt until the mixture is
  combined well. In a small bowl, whisk together the whole eggs, the yolks,
  the vanilla and the almond extract, add the mixture to the flour mixture,
  beating until a dough is formed, and stir in the almonds.
    Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, knead it several
  times, and divide it into fourths. Working on 2 large buttered and floured
  baking sheets, with floured hands form each piece of dough into a flattish
  log 11 inches long and 2 inches wide, arrange the logs at least 3 inches
  apart on the sheets, and brush them with the egg wash. Bake the logs in a
  preheated 350F oven for 35 minutes and let them cool on the baking sheets
  on racks for 10 minutes. On a cutting board, cut the logs crosswise on the
  diagonal into 3/4" inch slices, arrange them the biscotti, cut sides down,
  on the baking sheets, and bake them in the 350F oven for 5 to 7 minutes on
  each side, or until they are pale golden. Transfer the biscotti to racks to
  cool and store them in airtight containers. MAKES ABOUT 56 BISCOTTI

      Title: Biscotti Del Laggaccio
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 1 servings
 
-------------------------------FOR THE SPONGE-------------------------------
      1 pk Active dry yeast; 2 1/2 tsp       3/4 c  Flour;all purpose,
    1/2 c  -Warm water                              Unbleached

-------------------------------FOR THE DOUGH-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Sugar                           2 1/2 c  Flour;all purpose,
    1/2 c  -Water &                                 Unbleached
      2 tb -Water                              1 tb Aniseed
    1/4 c  Butter; unsalted, 1/2 stick       1/2 ts -Salt
           -cut into bits & softened      
 
  "Did Columbus and his crews sail to the new world eating these traditional
  Ligurian biscotti? It's entirely possible, although theirs would have been
  cooked much longer to drive off all the moisture, allowing them to keep for
  an entire ocean crossing. Though these biscotti are made with an enriched
  bread dough instead of the traditional cookie dough and have a somewhat
  softer texture, they keep well when stored in an airtight container."
  
  Make the sponge: In the bowl of an electric mixer proof the yeast in the
  water for 5 minutes, or until the mixture is foamy. Whisk in the flour and
  let the sponge stand, covered with plastic wrap, for 30 minutes or until it
  is foamy.
   To the sponge, add the sugar, the water and the butter and stir the
  mixture until it is combined well. Add the flour, the aniseed, and the salt
  and with the electric mixer fitted with the dough hook knead the dough for
  3 minutes, or until it is smooth but still sticky. Transfer the dough to a
  lightly oiled bowl, turning it to coat it with the oil, and let it rise,
  covered tightly with plastic wrap, for 1 1/2 hours, or until it is double
  in bulk.
    Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, halve it, and with
  floured hands form each piece of dough into a flattish log 15 inches long
  and 2 inches wide. Transfer the logs to a buttered and floured baking sheet
  and let them rise, covered with a kitchen towel, for 2 hours, or until they
  are double in bulk.
    Bake the logs in the middle of a preheated 350F oven for 30 minutes, or
  until they are golden brown, and let them cool on the baking sheet on a
  rack for 10 minutes. On a cutting board cut the logs crosswise on the
  diagonal into 1 inch thick slices, arrange the biscotti, cut sides down, on
  the baking sheet and bake them in the 350F oven for 10 minutes on each
  side, or until they are pale golden. Transfer the biscotti to racks to cool
  and store them in airtight containers. MAKES:ABOUT 30 BISCOTTI

      Title: Chicken Tagine with Seven Vegetables
 Categories: Moroccan, Poultry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  3 1/2 lb Chicken                           1/4 ts Turmeric
      1 tb Olive oil                         1/4 ts Black pepper
  1 3/4 lb Eggplant                            1    Turnips
      2 tb Olive oil                           1 md Zucchini
      1 c  Onions, chopped                     1    Carrots
      3    Garlic cloves, crushed            1/2    Bell peppers, red
      3 c  Stock, chicken                      3 md Tomatoes
  1 1/2    Cinnamon sticks                   1/2 c  Raisins
      1 ts Curry powder                        1 tb Parsley
      1 ts Cumin, ground                  
 
  Cut chicken into serving pieces.  Remove backs and wings and save for soup.
  Remove all skin and fat from chicken.  Heat oil in large frying pan; saute
  chicken in 2 batches until opaque on both sides (a few minutes). Set aside.
  
  Cut unpeeled eggplant into 1" cubes; salt for 20 minutes, then drain and
  rinse.  Heat oil in 6-8-qt Dutch oven.  Add onion, garlic, and eggplant.
  Saute over low heat until onion is just tender, 5-10 minutes.
  
  Add stock, cinnamon, curry powder, cumin, turmeric, and black pepper. Stir,
  bring to boil, reduce heat, and simmer 10 minutes.
  
  Peel turnip; dice turnip, zucchini, carrot, and bell pepper. Add dark meat
  and diced vegetables to Dutch oven.  Simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes.
  
  Dice tomatoes.  Add chicken breasts, tomato, raisins, and parsley, pushing
  down lightly to be sure ingredients are covered by liquid. Simmer, covered,
  for 10 minutes more.
  
  Serve hot in deep soup bowls on top of rice, noodles, or couscous,
  garnishing top with coriander.
  
  Sylvia's notes: I used a whole chicken and dumped everything in the
  crockpot, which worked fine except that the vegetables weren't done (since
  it cooked about 6 hours instead of the usual 10 when I use the cp on a
  workday), so I boiled the vegetables in the stock until they were soft.
  However, I was not pleased with the result, and I think it was the
  combination of flavors (or lack thereof) rather than the cooking method.
  The chicken was fine, and the broth was delicious, but the vegetables were
  tasteless cardboard.

      Title: Boiled Custard Eggnog
 Categories: Beverages
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    3/4 c  Sugar                               1 c  Cream, light
    1/8 c  Flour                             1/2 ts Extract, vanilla
   1/16 ts Salt                             1/16 ts Nutmeg, ground
      4 ea Egg yolks                         3/4 c  Whiskey; optional
      3 c  Milk                           
 
  Mix sugar, flour, and salt in heavy 6-qt saucepan. Add egg yolks and mix
  well.  Using wire whisk, stir egg mixture and slowly pour in milk and
  cream.  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until custard is thickened
  and just coats the back of a wooden spoon. Remove from heat and let cool.
  The custard will thicken as it cools. When cold, stir in vanilla, nutmeg,
  and whiskey.
  
  Sylvia's notes: This is another of those recipes that are written for chefs
  with dozens of apprentices floating around to do the tedious work. Stir
  constantly over low heat, indeed!  I used medium-high heat, and it STILL
  took 25 minutes of stirring constantly.  It is a nice thick eggnog, but I'm
  not wild about the subtle but detectable floury taste. I'll hold onto this
  until I have a tested eggnog recipe that I like better, and then it'll be
  history.

      Title: Baileys Irish Cream
 Categories: Beverages
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 ts Gelatin; dissolved in               1 c  Whiskey
    1/2 c  Water                               1 ts Coffee, powdered
      6 oz Milk, canned                        1 ts Extract, vanilla
      6 oz Milk, sweetened evaporated     
 
  I reduced the instant coffee to one teaspoon from three because the coffee
  flavor was too overpowering and the Irish teaspoon is smaller than ours. Of
  course, people that pour Baileys into coffee won't be able to tell the
  difference.  I even think that chocolate might even be better.
  
  This recipe was given to me (uncle Jack) at a private tea by an Irish lady
  who owns a large department store in Dublin.

      Title: Andouille-Tasso Dressing
 Categories: Dressings
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 lb Andouille; finely chopped         1/2 c  Tasso; finely chopped
      4 c  Chicken stock                       1 pk Cornbread; about 9-inch pan
      4 tb Margarine                           1 c  Onions; finely chopped
    1/2 c  Green onions; finely choppe       1/2 c  Celery; finely chopped
    1/2 c  Mushrooms; fresh, sliced          1/4 c  Parsley; finely chopped
    1/4 c  Bell pepper; finely chopped         2 ts Garlic; finely chopped
      2 ts Salt                                1 ts Black pepper
 
      Start off by baking your cornbread to package directions (be sure you
  choose an unsweetened cornbread mix) and letting it cool to room
  temperature.  Then, to a 2-1/2-quart saucepan, bring the chicken stock to a
  boil, toss in the finely chopped andouille and tasso, reduce the heat, and
  simmer for about 1 hour until the meats are soft and tender.
      Meanwhile, take a 12-inch skillet and melt the margarine over medium
  heat.  Then quickly saute the onions, green onions, celery, mushrooms, bell
  pepper, parsley and garlic until all of them are just wilted -- DO NOT
  OVERCOOK!     Next, take a mixing bowl and crumble the cornbread. Then stir
  in the sauteed vegetable mixture and all of the meats and blend everything
  thoroughly.     At this point, begin adding the meat stock you made - a
  little at a time -- to moisten the dressing. Remember... you want the
  stuffing "just moist" -- not wet! And you want to taste the stuffing before
  adding any salt and pepper. There may already be enough in the tasso and
  andouille to suit you. Use with Stuffed Veal Pocket. NOTE: The best way to
  enhance the flavor of a traditional New Orleans veal pocket is to stuff it
  with a cornbread dressing spiced up with andouille and tasso. From "Frank
  Davis Cooks Naturally N'Awlins" by Frank Davis.

      Title: Baked Polenta with Bacon and Onions
 Categories: Italian
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3    Slices lean bacon, chopped        1/4 ts Dried crumbled sage
      2    Onions, sliced thin               1/2 c  Coarse ground cornmeal
      1 c  Water                               1 tb Unsalted butter
    3/4 c  Chicken broth                     1/4 c  Fresh grated Parmesan
 
  In a large saucepan, cook bacon until almost crisp. Remove the bacon and
  take out all but 1 tbsp of the fat. Add the onions and cook until softened
  but not browned. Transfer the onion to a bowl. To the pan add the water,
  broth and sage and bring to a boil. Stirring constantly, add the cornmeal,
  a little at a time. Cook over low heat, stirring almost constantly, until
  it is thick and pulls away from the sides of the pan, 20-25 minutes. Stir
  in the butter, 2 tbsp of the Parmesan and half the onions. Spread in a 3
  cup gratin dish. Mix the bacon into the remaining onion mixture and spread
  on top of the polenta.  Sprinkle on the remaining Parmesan and bake in the
  middle of a preheated 400 oven until the cheese is melted and just starting
  to brown.  This serves 2 as a main dish, 4 as a side dish. Can be doubled
  or tripled and can be made and assembled earlier in the day and baked when

  Grand prize:  Gail Krawetz, Invermay, Sask.
  
  "My grandmother was renowned for her baked cornmeal. She was asked to bring
  a roasterful to church dinners and local weddings. Now my mother often does
  the same thing. The secret to light cornmeal is to cook it on the stove,
  then bake it." Serve this cornmeal with roasted meats, cooked vegetables or
  a salad.
  
  In a large saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat; cook onion, stirring
  occasionally, for 5 minutes or until golden. Reduce heat to medium-low;
  stir in cornmeal until well coated. Stir in milk, salt and sugar; cook,
  stirring constantly, for 15 to 20 minutes or until thickened. combine eggs,
  cream and baking powder. reserving 2 Tbsp for topping, gradually stir in
  egg mixture into cornmeal; cook, stirring for 7 minutes or until very
  thick. Pour into greased 12 cup (3 L) casserole dish. Drizzle reserved egg
  mixture over top; bake, uncovered in 325F oven for 1 hour or until golden.

      Title: Barkshack Ginger Mead
 Categories: Beverages
      Yield: 5 servings
 
      7 lb Light honey                       1/4 ts Irish moss powder
  1 1/2 lb Corn sugar                          1 lb To 6 lbs crushed fruit
      1 oz To 6 oz fresh ginger root           3 oz Lemongrass, or other spices
  1 1/2 ts Gypsum                              1 pk Champagne yeast
      3 ts Yeast nutrient OR...              3/4 c  Corn sugar (bottling)
    1/4 oz Yeast extract                  
 
  Boil 1 1/2 gallons of water, the honey, corn sugar, grated ginger root,
  gypsum, citric acid, irish moss, and yeast nutrient for 15 minutes.  Turn
  the heat off.  If you're going to add fruit (this is entirely optional, as
  are the spices) then fish out as much of the ginger root shavings as you
  can.  Then add your crushed fruit or concentrate and let it steep for 10-15
  minutes.  Some ideas for fruit are:  Sour cherries, blackberries,
  raspberries, blueberries, chokecherries, rhubarb, grapes, grape
  concentrate... go wild here.
  
  Pour the entire must (unsparged if fruit is added) into an open primary
  fermenter and add about 3 gallons of cold water.  When cooled to 70 to 78
  degrees, hydrate and pitch your yeast.  After the specific gravity has
  fallen to 1.020 or within 7 days, whichever comes first, rack the brew into
  a secondary fermenter.  Leave the fruit behind.  Age 1 to 1 1/2 months in
  the secondary fermenter.  Bottle with 3/4 cups priming sugar. If using
  spices or herbs as a flavoring, add them now by making a "tea" and adding
  them at bottling time.  The flavors will be fresher and sharper. Some
  suggested spices are lemon grass, citrus peel (just the zest, not the white
  part), etc.  If using cloves, cinnamon, or hops go lightly on these. Adding
  flavors in this manner also allows you to use different flavors in the same
  batch, since you're just adding a "tea" to the mead at bottling time. You
  can bottle two or three flavors at once this way!
  
  This mead should age from 3 months up to a year to allow the harsh flavors
  to mellow out.  Tasting at 6 months will show approximate flavor profile.
  Serve well chilled.

      Title: Basic Egg-Pasta Recipe
 Categories: Mix
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    3/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose              1    Egg
           -Flour                         
 
  Combine the flour and egg in the mixing bowl of a food processor fitted
  with a steel blade.Process for a few minutes.The dough will look very
  granular,like yellow-colored,uncooked cream of wheat.Pinch the dough.It
  should stock together.If it does not stick,mix in a bit of oil or water.
  Form a ball with the dough and knead for a few minutes on a lightly floured
  board.It will become smooth and hard(much harder than bread dough).In a few
  minutes,the dough should look satiny and smooth.Wrap it in plastic and let
  rest for about 30 minutes. Then roll out the dough through a pasta roller
  or by hand.Sprinkle additional flour on the dough as needed to prevent
  sticking.The dough is quite forgiving and can be handled easily. When the
  rolled-out pasta sheet feels dry,not sticky,cut into noodles by hand or
  with the machine. If you have a pasta drying rack,hang the cut pasta on the
  rack.If not,wrap the noodles around your hand to form a nest and set it on
  a lightly floured board.Toss with flour on occasion to allow the pasta to
  dry evenly. Fresh pasta cooks quickly.Add it to boiling water and test a
  strand every 15 seconds until done. Sometimes,I vary this recipe by adding
  1 1/2 tsp. of olive oil and up to 1 tbsp. of a flavoring ingredient,such as
  minced fresh herbs or garlic,tomato paste or pureed beets. Keeping the same
  proportions of 1 egg to 3/4 cup flour,the recipe can be multiplied as many
  times as needed.A 1 egg recipe will feed 1 or 2 people for a main course;a
  2 egg recipe feeds 2 to 3.An average size food processor will handle a 3
  egg recipe easily.If you need to make more,it is a good idea to make
  several batches.

      Title: Basic Fresh Pasta Dough
 Categories: Pasta
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Unbleached flour                    1 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Semolina or durum flour             3    Eggs (or more); beaten
      1 ts Salt                           
 
  PLACE ALL ingredients except egg into a food processor. Add the egg a bit
  at a time while pulsing. When the dough forms into pellets, you've added
  enough eggs. Turn the dough onto a work surface and knead together into a
  stiff mass. Let rest for 15 minutes before rolling into pasta.

      Title: Blueberry Sausage Breakfast Treat
 Categories: Breakfast
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    3/4 lb Sausage, pork                     1/4 c  Sugar, brown
      2 c  Flour                               2    Eggs
      1 ts Baking powder                       8 oz Sour cream
    1/2 ts Baking soda                         1 c  Blueberries
    1/2 c  Butter                            1/2 c  Pecans, chopped
    1/2 c  Sugar                          
 
  Day before: Cook sausage and drain well.  Stir together flour, baking
  powder, and baking soda.  In large mixing bowl, beat butter until fluffy.
  Add sugars and beat until well-blended. Add eggs, one at a time, beating
  well after each.  Alternate adding flour mixture and sour cream to creamed
  ingredients; mix well. Fold in sausage and berries. Pour batter into
  ungreased 13"x9"x2" baking pan.  Sprinkle pecans on top. Refrigerate
  overnight.
  
  Preheat oven to 350.  Bake 35-40 minutes, until done. Cool on wire rack.
  
  Sylvia's notes:  With two young kids, I didn't want to use chopped nuts, so
  I sprinkled raw oats on top. Then, I didn't have a 13"x9" pan, so used two
  8"x3-3/4" pans.  And my oven was broken so I used my toaster oven and baked
  one pan 35 minutes at 350.  The batter is so thick it's very hard to work
  with; I need to add more liquid next time. It's also too rich to bake
  easily, think I'll replace some sour cream with water or milk.

      Title: Buffalo Burgers
 Categories: Misc., Meats
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Ground buffalo                      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper                              1 ts Mustard
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce                2 ts Horseradish
      4 ts Ketchup                        
 
  The beauty of this recipe is that accurate measurements can go out the
  window. Add more or less of the spicings that you like. Toss it all in and
  mix it up. Patty up and grill. Serve like a regular hamburger. Tip: If you
  have a grill that tells the temperature, keep it down! Or let the coals die
  down some. Don't put lean buffalo meat in the flame. ( Buffalo is a lean
  red meat and is some what dry so you have to cook it slowly to keep the
  juices in.) These burgers were taste tested by the usually critical
  teen-age crowd. They asked for seconds. I take that as an impressive OK.

  Spice is great on most all meats; including pork chops and steaks; chicken
  and seafoods.  The food to be blackened should be moistened on both sides
  with butter or margarine.  Then coated with the spice mix.  The coated meat
  should then be cooked in a white hot cast iron skillet on both sides until
  degree of wellness is reached and spice looks like a black crust.  Shrimp
  should be peeled, leaving only the tails on.  Foods my also be cooked on
  very hot grill.  Always cook in well ventilated area, as mixture may smoke
  alot.  Amount of coating is to taste.  This is a very spicy mix.  Start
  lite and work your way up.
  
  Blackened shrimp makes for great appetizer along with a good cocktail
  sauce.  Shrimp need to be attened continually while cooking as it only
  requires a couple minutes each side.

  each circle of dough, leaving about a 1/2-inch margin.
  
  5. Sprinkle half of each circle with half of the prosciutto strips and 1
  cup of the mozarella cheese. Fold circles in halves over filling,
  moistening and pinching edges together (or pressing with tines of a fork)
  to seal.
  
  6. Preheat oven to 450~ F. Sprinkle a large, greased baking sheet lightly
  with cornmeal. Place calzone well apart on prepared baking sheet. Let rise
  until puffy (12 to 15 minutes). Brush tops lightly with olive oil, then

  Make a white sauce by melting the butter in a double boiler, stirring in
  the flour and adding the milk gradually. Cook, stirring constantly to the
  thickened sauce. Add pepper and check for salt. Adjust if necessary. We
  like it served over toasted English Muffins. This will make enough sauce
  for about 6-8 muffin halves, depending on how generous you are with the

      Title: Cinnamon Honey Ale
 Categories: Beverages
      Yield: 5 servings
 
  3 1/2 lb Laaglander Amber dry malt       2 1/2 lb Raw honey
  1 1/2 oz Cascade hops (boiling)            1/2 oz Cascade hops (finishing)
      6 x  Inches cinnamon bark                1 pk Ale yeast (Glenbrew)
 
  O.G. -- 1.048 T.G. -- 1.006
  
  Source/author -- Basic recipe idea from Charlie Papazian's "Rocky Raccoon's
  Crystal Honey Lager", modified by Gary D. Foster Add honey, malt, and
  boiling hops to 5 gallons of water.  Boil for one hour, skimming the
  surface every few minutes to remove the assorted bee antennae and eyeballs
  from the unfiltered honey.  Lightly crush the cinnamon bark and add during
  the final 10 minutes of the boil.  Add the finishing hops 3 minutes from
  the end of the boil.  Sparge, cool, and siphon into primary, topping off to
  5 gallons with pre-boiled water. Pitch yeast, ferment, prime with 3/4 cup
  of dry malt boiled in 1 1/2 cups water, and bottle.
  
  Allow beer to age at least a month before drinking.  As is typical with
  honey-based brews, this beer gets better and better with age.

      Title: Cranberry-Raspberry Preserves
 Categories: Fruits, Preserve
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      6 c  Raspberries (3 pints)             1/4 c  Fresh orange juice
  2 1/2 c  Sugar                                    Grated zest of 1 orange
      3 c  Cranberries (12 oz. bag)       
 
  Stir together the raspberries and 1 cup of the sugar in a medium bowl and
  let stand for 1 hour.
  
  Stir the cranberries and the remaining sugar together in a nonreactive
  shallow preserving pan and place over high heat.  Stir constantly so the
  sugar does not burn until the cranberries begin to release juice, about 5
  minutes.  Continue cooking until all the cranberries have popped and the
  mixture is syrupy and comes to a boil.  Skim off any foam that forms on top
  and continue to cook and stir until the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes
  more.
  
  Add the raspberries and all their juice and cook for 10 minutes more. Stir
  in the orange juice and zest.
  
  Remove a small amount of the jam to a saucer and place in the freezer for 5
  minutes.  If the mixture wrinkles when pused to one side, it is ready. If
  not, continue cooking for 5 minutes and retest.
  
  When the preserves are the right consistency, turn down the heat to a
  simmer and ladle into hot sterilized jars.  Wipe the rims clean with a damp
  towel and seal with new lids and metal rings.  Process in a hot-water bath
  for 5 minutes.  Remove, cook, check seals, label, and store.
  
  Makes 4 one pint jars.

           Unsalted butter and freshly    
 
  In a heavy medium saucepan, bring 4 cups of water to a boil.  Reduce the
  heat to low and add the salt.  Slowly pour the polenta into the water,
  stirring constantly.  Keep stirring for about 5 minutes, until evenly
  thickened and soupy.  Adjust the heat to the lowest setting so that the
  polenta barely bubbles.  Cook for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring every few
  minutes to keep it from sticking to the pan.  If it gets too thick, just
  add water in small amounts until it is the consistency you want.
  
  When done, eat it right away with butter and Parmesan cheese.

      Title: Cristel's Beef Strips with Sweet & Hot Sauce
 Categories: Misc.
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Round steak                              ------------------------
      2 tb Water                                    SWEET & HOT SAUCE
      1 ts Salt                              1/3 c  Catsup
    1/3 c  Cooking oil                     2 1/2 tb Vinegar
      1    Egg                               1/4 ts Dry mustard
      1 c  Dry bread crumbs                2 1/2 tb Sugar
    1/4 ts Ginger                          2 1/2 tb Soy sauce
           Dash of pepper                    1/4 ts Hot pepper sauce
 
  Recipe Source: Cristel Morton, London, Ontario, Canada.
  
  Trim fat from steak.  Cut steak into 3/4 inch wide strips.
  
  Beat the egg in a bowl with water until well mixed.
  
  In a separate bowl, mix bread crumbs, salt, ginger and pepper.
  
  Dip strips in egg mixture, then roll through crumb mixture. Arrange strips
  on a baking sheet *SEE NOTE BELOW* Chill in refrigerator at least 15
  minutes *SEE NOTE BELOW*
  
  Depending on the size of the steak and the thickness of the cut, more egg
  and crumb mixture may be necessary.
  
  Heat oil in a large fry pan until hot. Oil should be about 1/4 inch deep in
  the pan. Remove strips from refrigerator and fry in oil a few at a time for
  about 30 - 40 sec per side (top & bottom) turning once.  Do not overcook.
  
  Remove strips and drain on paper towel.  Keep the strips warm. (Placing
  paper towel on a cookie sheet and placing in a 200F oven seems to work
  well.)
  
  SWEET & HOT SAUCE:
  
  Combine all ingredients for the sauce in a saucepan (or measuring cup) and
  stir together well. Heat on stove top, or in microwave until bubbly hot.
  
  Serve beef strips with hot sauce and french fries.
  
  NOTE: The steak can be cut and frozen so that the preparation time is
  greatly reduced. After the steak is cut, roll in flour and arrange so that
  the strips can be laid out to thaw in a single layer. If the strips are
  still chilled when it's time to cook them, just dip into the egg, roll in
  crumbs and place directly into the hot oil.  The chilling process is to
  firm up the egg & crumb mixture so that they don't fall off the meat during
  the frying. If the meat is already sufficiently cold (from defrosting), the
  chilling in the refrigerator is not necessary.

  Taglioni Colla Crocia (Ruota di Faraone)
  
  To quote the author, "Tagliolini colla Crocia" is traditionally served on
  Shabbat B'shallach in all parts of Italy and is associated by Italian Jews
  with the passage of the Israelites through the Red Sea and their
  deliverance from the Egyptians although the preparation of it, and even the
  name, varies from place to place."
  
  *Anne's note: Butter or margarine may be substituted for the chicken fat as
  it is used to grease a dish.
  
  Roll out the dough not too thin and fold as you would for a jelly roll, 2
  1/2" wide. Cut 1/6" wide slices and toss to unfold noodles.
   Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil. Add tagliolini and salt; when boiling
  resumes, cook 1 minute.
   Drain, and place in a large bowl with meat sauce and diced cold cuts. Toss
  quickly to distribute the dressing evenly.
   Place in a round oven proof baking dish, well greased with fat.* If using
  raisins and nuts, make layers, alternating pasta with a mixture of raisins
  and nuts. Bake in 350F oven for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or till a nice crust is
  formed on all sides. Invert over a serving dish and bring to the table.

 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      4 ea Deer filets of loin               1/4 ts Worcestershire sauce
      2 tb Butter                            1/4 ts Salt

      Title: Delicate Homemade Pasta
 Categories: Italian, Pasta
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 c  Flour, whole wheat pastry           2    Eggs, large
      1 c  Flour, unbleached                   2 ts Olive oil
      1 ts Salt                                2 tb Water, more as necessary
 
  Sift together the flours and salt and pour out on a clean, dry board. Shape
  into a mound, then make a well in the center with the "walls" of the flour
  even all around.  Crack the eggs into the well and add the oil. Using a
  fork, mix the flour together with the egg mixture, keeping the "well"
  intact by cupping one hand around the wall of flour while you brush flour
  from the top of the wall into the well, incor-porating it into the egg
  mixture.  The mixture of eggs and flour will get very sticky; keep
  incorporating flour with the fork while you con-tinue to confine the flour
  with your other hand so it doesn't scatter itself all over the working
  surface.  (You won't be able to get all the flour incorporated, and some
  flakes of the mixture won't be absorbed, but don't be concerned with this
  small amount---you'll have plenty of pasta.)
  
  When you have incorporated all the flour you can into the egg mixture,
  sprinkle with the water.  This may make the mixture sticky. Sprinkle with a
  little more flour---just a little---so you can handle the dough, and mix
  the dough vigorously with your hands.  When the dough is smooth and
  elastic, knead it for 5 minutes.  Shape the dough into a ball, wrap it in a
  damp towel, and let rest for 30 minutes to an hour.
  
  Divide the dough into eight. Roll out as thin as possible---start at the
  thickest setting your machine allows, and run each piece through many
  times, each time setting the machine one notch thinner.  The dough will
  shrink back a little, so roll it thinner than you want it. Run through the
  cutters, or cut with a knife into the desired shapes, and place on waxed
  paper until ready to cook.  If storing, allow to dry and wrap in plastic.
  Keep in a cool, dry place.

      1 c  All-purpose unbleached flour             - softened
      2    Eggs                                     Grated Parmesan cheese
           Olive oil                                Freshly ground black pepper
      1 ds Salt                           
 
  Combine flours in large bowl. Mix well. Make well in center of flour and
  drop in eggs, 1 tablespoon oil and salt. Using fork, beat mixture into
  flour, working up to rim gradually and incorporating wet ingredients with
  flour thoroughly. If too dry, add a few drops of water. When combined,
  moisten hands with oil and work dough, kneading and folding about 10
  minutes until smooth and pliable. Continue kneading 5 minutes longer until
  dough is completely smooth. (Kneading, because of toughness of semolina
  flour, will be difficult, but keep going. Keep hands moistened with oil
  during kneading process to help stretch dough and make it pliable.) Form
  into ball, cover and let stand 10 minutes to rest. Process through pasta
  machine according to manufacturer's directions or roll very thin. Cut for
  fettuccine noodles. Use at once or allow to dry and store for future use.
  
  When ready to serve, drop fettuccine in boiling salted water and cook until
  fettuccine rises to surface, about 2 minutes. Quickly drain and place in
  warm bowl containing half of softened butter. Top with lumps of remaining
  butter and 1/3 to 1/2 cup cheese. Toss lightly, using fork and spoon, about
  2 minutes, until fettuccine is well coated and creamy sauce is formed.
  Serve sprinkled with pepper and additional grated cheese.

    1/2 lb Butter                              2 tb Oil
      3 tb Rubbed sage                     3 1/2 c  Milk
      3    Large heads fresh garlic            9    Large cloves fresh garlic,
      2 c  Self rising flour                        -minced
      2    Eggs                                1 lb Lean ham, minced
 
  Mix together 12 tablespoons (1-1/2 sticks) butter and sage; reserve. Remove
  as much outer skin from garlic as possible without piercing the cloves'
  covering. Set garlic in saucepan, cover with water and boil gently about 45
  minutes or until cloves are quite soft. Remove from heat. When cool enough
  to handle squeeze each clove to remove cooked garlic by grasping clove at
  tip and pulling down toward base. In mixing bowl, beat garlic with fork
  until smooth. Add to garlic same amount (at least one cup) flour, eggs, oil
  and 1-1/2 cups milk to make pancake batter. Add minced garlic to batter and
  set aside. Melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter and keep warm. While waiting
  for batter to work, place half the sage butter (6 tb) in saucepan, add 6 tb
  flour to make a roux and cook at medium temperature, stirring frequently,
  to brown. Meanwhile in skillet, place remaining 2 tb of remaining sage
  butter and add ham. Heat thru, but do not burn. When roux is nicely
  browned, add remaining 2 cups milk. Allow to thicken, stirring frequently.
  Add ham and skillet drippings and mix to make ham sauce. Keep warm. Heat
  griddle or clean skillet and grease lightly with a bit of remaining sage
  butter. Drop batter by spoonfuls onto griddle to make silver dollar-sized
  pancakes. Serve with melted butter and ham sauce. Makes 2 dozen pancakes.

  Cooking the garlic until it is soft changes its flavor from pungent to
  sweet and nut-like -- a very good addition to pancakes and a pleasant
  compliment to the smokiness of the ham sauce. Serve for breakfast, brunch,
  lunch or even a light supper.

      Title: Garlic Pickles
 Categories: Relishes
      Yield: 60 servings
 
      4    Heads of Cauliflower               15 tb Salt
      4    Heads of Green Cabbage             10 l  Hot water
      1 bn Fresh Carrots                       2 tb Mustard seeds
      1    Head of Garlic                      2 tb Peppercorns
      1 bn Celery                              4    Bay leaves
      4 lb Kirby Cucumbers                
 
  These are the approximate ingredients you would need to fill up a 10 liter
  barrel.  (I have a plastic container which was used to hold olives that I
  got from a Greek deli)  You can vary the ingredients, if for example, you
  were just interested in making pickles and don't care for cabbage or
  cauliflower.  Green tomatoes also turn out well.  What ever container you
  use, may sure that it closes securely and that it's something you'll be
  able to rotate (to mix the ingredients in it).
  
  Peel garlic and cut each clove in half.  Peel carrots.  Wash vegetables.
  Cut cabbage, carrots and celery into quarters.  Break apart cauliflower.
  Leave cucumbers or tomatoes whole.  With cabbage, discard outer leaves and
  cut off the hard part at the base.  With the cauliflower, leave alittle it
  of the leaves on for taste but discard the hard part of the stem.
  
  Mix vegetables in layers so all of one kind is not next to the other.  Put
  in the vegetables, garlic, then vegetables again, and so on.  Add 1 heaping
  tablespoon of salt for each liter of hot water that you will add to the
  barrel.  After the barrel is full with the vegetables and water, add 5 more
  tablespoons of salt on top, along with 2 tablespoons of mustard seeds, 2
  tablespoons peppercorns and 4 bay leaves.  You can use a cheescloth bag to
  put the mustard seeds and peppercorns in or just throw them in loosely.
  
  Use clean wood sticks or empty glass bottles on top to hold down all
  vegetables under the water, if necessary.  It's important for them to be
  covered at all times.  Mix the barrel (if it's large, it can be rolled on
  the floor!)  when done and shake it again each day for the next few days.
  It's important to make sure it's being mixed well.  It should be ready in
  about 10 days to eat.  Kirby cucumbers may take a few days longer.  Taste
  the liquid after the first couple of days, as you may need to add an
  additional tablespoon of salt or two.  It's important not to add too much
  salt in the beginning but to keep the balance constant and to add alittle
  more as the salt is absorbed.  In our case, we added 3 tablespoons of salt
  on the sixth day, but this could change according to what you put in and
  the size of your barrel.

      Title: Gooseberry Curd
 Categories: Fruits, Preserve
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 pt Gooseberries                        2 tb Unsalted butter
      2 tb -Water                              2    Eggs
    1/2 c  Sugar                               1    Egg yolk
 
  Rinse the gooseberries and put them in a non-corroding saucepan with the
  water.  Cover and cook over low to medium heat, stirring occasionally, for
  about 20 minutes, or until the gooseberries are very mushy.  Puree them
  through a food mill or a strainer.  You should have about 1 1/4 cups of
  puree.
  
  Stir the sugar and butter into the warm puree and heat, stirring
  constantly.  Whisk the eggs and the egg yolk just until mixed, then whisk
  in a little of the hot gooseberry mixture to heat the eggs.  Return to the
  pan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture is well
  thickened, and has reached a temperature of 170 F.  Pour into a container,
  cover, and chill.
  
  Use this to fill small tartlets, garnishing them with rosettes of creme de
  Chantilly; or fill a 9-inch pre-baked tart shell with the curd and pipe
  rosettes of creme Chantilly over the top, leaving a small spot uncovered in
  the center so the curd will show.  This also makes a delicious filling for
  cakes.  Like most high-acid fruit curds, this will keep at least two weeks
  in the refrigerator.
  
  Creme Chantilly: Whip the amount of cold fresh cream needed for your recipe
  until it mounds softly and will just barely hold its shape.  The volume
  will approximately double after it is whipped.  There should be no hint of
  graininess, which is the first sign that the cream is overbeaten and
  turning to butter.  Stir in vanilla and sugar to taste.  Or you may flavor
  the cream with spirits or liqueurs, wine, fruit purees or jams, or the
  reduced liquid from poached fruit.

 Categories: Preserve
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Underripe Granny Smiths,                 (do not core or peel)
           Pippins, green apples;              2 c  Water for each pound of
           Washed and cut into eighths              Apples
 
  Place the apples and water in a large stockpot or soup kettle, cover, and
  bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes or until apples are
  tender.  Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.
  
  Pour the pulp and juice through a jelly bag or line a large bowl with
  dampened cheesecloth, pour the pulp and juice through, gather the corners
  of the cheesecloth, and tie in a knot.  Suspend from a cabinet knob or
  handle and allow to drip into a bowl overnight.
  
  The next day, measure the apple juice and pour into a large pot.  Bring to
  a boil voer high heat and cook until reduced by half.  Refrigerate and use

  the pan with a plastic ruler before boiling.  Re-measure as liquid reduces.
  No need to pour into measuring cup!

      Title: Hot Cranberry Kissel
 Categories: Syrups
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Lemon                              12 oz Fresh or frozen cranberries
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar                  1/8 ts Ground cinnamon
    3/4 c  Water                          
 
  Kissel is a saucelike Russian dessert, usually made with one or more red
  fruits (berries or plums) and often containing red wine.  It is wonderful
  with pancakes and waffles, and even better with a spoonful of sour cream or
  yogurt on top.  The sauce keeps at least a week in the refrigerator.
  
  Directions:
  
  Remove 3 lengthwise strips of peel from the lemon with a vegetable peeler.
  Put the peel into a medium-size saucepan along with the sugar and water.
  Bring to a boil over moderate heat, stirring once or twice to help the
  sugar dissolve.  Reduce the heat and simmer 5 minutes.
  
  Rinse the cranberries (don't rinse frozen berries), and remove any stems or
  squashed berries.  Add to the pan and when boiling, simmer about 5 minutes
  until most of the skins have popped.  Remove and discard the lemon peel.
  Dip out about 1 cup of the popped berries and reserve.
  
  Puree the remaining berries and the syrup in a food processor or blender
  and put back in the pan.  Stir in the cinnamon and the reserved berries.
  Serve warm.  Makes 2 cups.
  
  SUMMER CRANBERRY SAUCE:  Make this when cranberries aren't available.  In a
  small saucepan, heat one 16-ounce can whole-berry crangerry sauce, 2 strips
  lemon peel, and about 1/16 teaspoon ground cinnamon.  Simmer 5 minutes over
  low heat, stirring often, to develop the flavor.  Discard peel. Serve sauce
  warm.  Makes 1 1/2 cups.

      2    Heads Chinese cabbage               1    Piece fresh gingerroot (1")
           -OR- white cabbage                  1    Celery stalk
      1 c  Salt                                1    Hard, semi-ripe pear
      1 lb Daikon                              4 tb Ground red pepper (cayenne)
      6    Green (spring) onions               1 tb Granulated sugar
      4    Garlic cloves                  
 
  1. Remove (do not discard) the outer leaves from the cabbage.  Quarter the
  cabbage and place together with the outside leaves in a large bowl.
  Sprinkle on the salt.  Let stand 3 hours, turning occasionally.
  
  2. Peel the daikon and cut into long thin strips.  Cut the onions into 1."
  strips and then shred lengthwise into slivers.  Mix the daikon and onion
  strips together in another bowl and let sit while the cabbage and salt
  mixture is sitting.
  
  3. Peel and mince garlic and gingerroot.  Cut celery into 1" lengths and
  shred lengthwise.  Peel, core, and slice the pear and then cut into long
  strips.  Mix these ingredients together with the cayenne and granulated
  sugar and combine into the daikon and onion mixture.
  
  4. The cabbage will have produced a brine after sitting.  Remove the outer
  leaves from the brine and set aside.  Take a quarter of the cabbage head,
  rinse it under running water then pack the daikon and onion mixture between
  the leaves. Set it in the bottom of a crock or other container. Repeat this
  procedure with the remaining three quarters. Any remaining mixture should
  be layered over the cabbage.
   Press down.
  
  5. Place the outer leaves in a layer on top of the cabbage and cover the
  crock. Set a small weight on top of the cover and let sit for 3 days. The
  longer it sits the stronger it gets!  It can be stored for a month prior to
  opening. Keep it in a cool (60 degree) place.
  
  After removing the Kim Chi from the crock it can be stored in glass jars
  and used as needed.
  
  This is a strong recipe and if it is still not hot enough, diced red
  peppers with seeds can be added, to the daikon and onion mixture, but do so
  at your own risk! Enjoy.

      Title: Lasagne Verdi
 Categories: Jewish, Italian, Pasta
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 c  Spinach;cooked, drained             4 tb Olive oil
      2    Eggs;slightly beaten                3 c  Mother's Tomato Sauce
  2 1/2 c  Flour; up to 3 cups                 3 c  Cheese Sauce
      6 qt -Water                            1/2 c  Parmesan cheese;freshly
           -Salt                                    -grated
 
  Green Lasagna To quote the author, "Many years ago, I invited some friends
  to try mu kosher green lasagne. At first they declined my invitation (being
  strictly orthodox, they seldom accepted invitations to eat in other
  people's homes). But when I insisted that I would buy everything new -from
  pots and pans to tablecloth and dishes - they accepted. They came early, so
  I prepared everything with their help. We had a lot of fun, and they liked
  my lasagna so much that they asked to stay for supper to eat the leftovers.
  Of course, I was very flattered and delighted that they stayed."
  
  Squeeze most of the liquid of the spinach. Chop very fine to the
  consistency of a smooth paste.  Make dough with spinach, eggs and flour as
  needed, following the directions for pasta - homemade. Roll it thin,
  sprinkling often with flour to avoid sticking . Cut into strips about 5X8
  inches. Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil with 3 Tbsp salt. Cook a few
  strips at a time for 2 minutes, uncovered. Remove from boiling water with a
  slotted spoon and drop into a basin of cold water. Drain and spread over a
  slightly damp cloth. Coat the bottom of a lasagna baking dish with 2 Tbsp
  oil and 1/4 cup tomato sauce. Place in it one layer; lightly cover it with
  tomato sauce and dollops of cheese sauce. Sprinkle with some Parmesan
  cheese and continue to make layers until you have used up all the pasta and
  the sauces. Sprinkle top with remaining oil and bake in a 400F oven for
  approximately 20 minutes. Serve with remaining Parmesan cheese in a
  separate dish. SERVES: 6

      Title: Latkes (Grated Potato Pancakes)
 Categories: Vegetables, Breakfast
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6    Medium potatoes                     1 ts Salt
      1    Onion                                    Vegetable shortening or
      2    Eggs                                     Oil for frying
    1/2 c  Flour                          
 
  Pare and grate potatoes into a mixing bowl.  Squeeze out liquid.  Peel and
  grate onion into potatoes.  Add eggs, flour, and salt and stir to make a
  smooth batter that will drop heavily from the spoon.
  
  Heap the shortening in a heavy frying pan using enough to cover the
  pancakes amply.  Drop the batter from a spoon into the hot shortening,
  making pancakes 3 inches in diameter.
  
  Fry over moderate heat until brown on the underside, turn to brown.  Life
  out and drain off excess fat on paper towel.  Pancakes fried in deep fat
  should be puffed and crisp.
  
  These pancakes may also be baked in a shallow baking pan for 45 minutes at
  350F until nicely browned.  Cut into squares and serve hot.
  
  They may also be put into a well greased small muffin pan and baked 45
  minutes at 350F.

      Title: Lbj Pedernales River Chili
 Categories: Misc., Chili, Meats
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      4 lb Venison, bite size                  1 ts Cumin seed
           - Chili grind fine  *OR*            2 c  Hot water
           Chuck, well trimmed, ground         6 ts Chili powder
      1 lg Onion, chopped                  1 1/2 c  Canned whole tomato
      2    Garlic cloves, minced               2 ds Liquid hot pepper sauce
      1 ts Oregano                                  Salt to taste
 
  Place meat, onion and garlic in a large heavy skillet or Dutch oven. Cook
  until light colored. Add oregano, cumin, water, chili powder, tomatoes, hot
  pepper sauce (more or less to taste), and salt. Bring to a boil, lowering
  heat, and simmer for one hour. Skim off fat during cooking. AUTHOR'S NOTE:
  Even more fat can be removed if chili is stored in refrigerator, allowing
  fat to rise to the top and solidify, when it can be easily removed. LBJ
  preferred venison in his chili, and so did his doctor, because it is so
  lean and fat-free. Ground beef heart is leaner still, and has a rich beef
  flavor with the added value of high Vit B content. This recipe was tailored
  to President Johnson after his first heart attack. Not only is it
  relatively fat-free, it calls for lean venison, when available.The local
  pronunciation of Pedernales is Purd-in-alice, and in this case local
  extends at least from Texas to Washington,D.C., to New York City. FROM: The

      Title: Lecithin Pan Coating
 Categories: Misc.
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Grain alcohol; or vodka             4 ts Lecithin, liquid
 
  This is similar to "PAM".
  
  Place grain alcohol & lecithin in a small jar & shake to mix.
  
  If you don't like using grain alcohol, it says you can use vegetable oil in
  its place.
  
  You can brush this on but a small spray bottle works better. I found that
  the bottle that throat spray comes in works great as it has a real fine
  spray. This stuff is super.

      Title: Low-Fat Devil's Chocolate Fudge Cake
 Categories: Low-cal
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 c  Water                               1 c  Plus 2 tb sugar
    1/2 c  Prune puree (see note below)      3/4 c  Unsweetened cocoa
           -or prepared prune butter       1 1/2 ts Baking powder
      3 lg Egg whites                        1/4 ts Baking soda
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla                           1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Plus 2 tb flour                
 
  Preheat oven to 350^.  Coat a 9" square pan with cooking spray.
  
  In a mixer bowl, combine water, prune puree, egg whites and vanilla. Beat
  thoroughly to blend. Combine flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking
  soda and salt.  Beat dry ingredients into liquid mixture. Spread batter
  into prepared pan.  Bake about 30 minutes, or until cake tests done.  Cool
  on rack in pan.  Serve dusted with powdered sugar or with the following
  icing.
  
  NOTE:  To prepare prune puree, simmer 1/2 c prunes in water to cover for
  about 10 minutes.  Let stand until cool.  Drain well. Force the prunes
  through a sieve, leaving behind the skin particles and seeds.
  
  ICING:  Combine 2 1/2 c powdered sugar, 1/4 c cocoa and 1/4 c low fat milk.
  Spread on cooled cake.
  
  This recipe for all of you healthy chocolate freaks. Note at the bottom,
  there is a method for making prune puree (very similar to the WonderSlim
  product that no one can find).  This recipe comes from an article about
  fruit, since it uses prune puree instead of fat. My one gripe, about which
  I have written to the paper, is that they do NOT do a nutritional analysis
  of a recipe, even though they call it low-fat.  However, those of us who
  are experienced in baking low-fat can see that there is little fat in this
  cake.

      1 ts Black cumin seeds              
 
  " "Garam marsala" means "hot spices" and is generally added to foods near
  the end of cooking or as a garnish. This homemade version is superior to
  store bought, which is usually heavy on the cheaper spices and not as
  fresh. Make this in small quantities so that it stays fresh. Cardamom seeds
  (not pods) available in East Indian food stores, are used here as they give
  a more delicate taste. Regular cumin seeds can be substituted for the black
  cumin seeds."
  
  Place ingredients in clean electric or spice grinder. Turn machine on 30 to
  40 seconds or until spices are finely ground. Store in small jar with
  tightly fitted lid. Keep away from heat and sunlight. MAKES ABOUT 3

      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    2-in piece of tamarind pulp         1    Lime (zest only)
           Peanut or corn oil              3 1/2 tb Tomato paste
           -(for deep-frying)                  4 tb Sugar
    1/4 lb Dried rice stick noodles          1/4 c  Thai fish sauce (nam pla)
      6 oz Med shrimp                          3 tb Fresh lime juice
           - shelled and deveined              4    Green onions; trimmed,
      1    Whole boned chicken breast               - cut into 1-in lengths
           - cut into slices                        - blanched
      4    Shallots; minced                    3 tb Fresh coriander leaves
      1 tb Minced garlic                     1/2 lb Bean sprouts; tails removed
      2 sm Serrano chiles                           - (for garnish)
           - finely minced               

------------------------------CRISPY EGG LACE------------------------------
           Oil for deep-frying               1/4 ts Salt
      2    Eggs; lightly beaten           
 
  COVER TAMARIND WITH 3/4 CUP hot water. Crush and break up pulp with a fork
  and let it stand for 20 minutes. Pour mixture through a strainer and press
  it through. Collect 1/2 cup tamarind liquid. Pour oil into a wok or deep
  saucepan to a depth of about 2-inches. Heat oil to 375F. In a large paper
  bag pull rice stick noodles apart into small batches. Add 1 batch to the
  oil. If the temperature is correct, noodles should puff up within seconds.
  Remove with a slotted spoon or strainer and drain on paper towel. Repeat
  with remaining noodles. If you are making the Crispy Egg Lace, prepare it
  at this time (See below). When the rice stick noodles and egg lace are
  done, pour off all but 2 tablespoons of oil from wok. Reheat wok and oil
  over medium-high heat. When hot, add shrimp and chicken; stir-fry for 1
  minute or until shrimp are bright orange and chicken is white. Remove and
  set aside. Add shallots, garlic, minced chiles and half the lime zest to
  the hot wok; stir-fry until soft, but not browned (about 1 minute). Add
  tomato paste and sugar. Cook, stirring constantly, until sugar becomes a
  dark crimson red with a sticky consistency. It should pull away from the
  wok into a thick mass. This is just short of the caramelized state (about 3
  to 4 minutes). Be careful not to burn the mixture. Immediately add the
  reserved tamarind liquid and fish sauce, reduce to low heat and simmer
  together for 1 minute. Add lime juice, reserved chicken-shrimp mixture,
  green onion and remaining lime zest; toss just enough to heat through.
  Remove from heat. Add 1/3 of fried rice stick noodles to the sauce. Gently
  crush noodles and toss with sauce to coat. Repeat with another third of
  noodles. Add last third of noodles only if there is enough sauce to coat.
  Toss in the coriander leaves. Mound noodles on a platter, Crispy Egg Lace
  (broken into smaller pieces) and bean sprouts.
  
  CRISPY EGG LACE: After frying noodles, skim leftover bits from wok. Keep
  oil hot. Beat eggs with salt in bowl. When oil is 375F, hold a
  medium-fine-mesh skimmer over oil; gently pour half the eggs through. Let
  eggs drip into oil in circular fashion. Deep-fry for 30 seconds or until
  lightly brown and crisp. Turn over to brown. It should have an irregular
  lacy shape. Remove and drain on paper towels. Keep in a warm oven. Break
  into smaller pieces. Makes 2 crispy egg laces.

      Title: Mee Krob (Sweet Thai Noodles)
 Categories: Thai, Pasta, Misc.
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/4 c  Water                               1 bn Green onions (whites only)
      1 c  Sugar (white granulated)            8 oz Tofu, firm or extra firm
      1 c  Vinegar (white)                     3 ea Eggs
      1 ts Salt                                2 c  Vegetable oil (approx. amnt)
    1/4 lb Dried shrimp (Kung Haeng)         1/4 lb Rice noodles (very thin)
      8 ea Serrano chilies                
 
  1.  Combine the water, sugar, vinegar, and salt in a small saucepan. Bring
  the mixture to a gentle boil and cook about ten minutes, until it forms a
  thin syrup.  Set aside.
  
  2.  Put the dried shrimp in a sieve and rinse them thoroughly under running
  water.  Set them aside in the sieve to drain.  Remove the stems, but not
  the seeds, from the chilies.  Slice the green onions and chilies lengthwise
  into thin strips and set them aside together.
  
  3.  Slice the tofu into 1/4-inch cubes and set aside.  Beat the eggs
  lightly, until they are well mixed but not frothy.  Strain through a fine
  sieve and set aside.
  
  4.  Pour about three inches of oil in a wok and heat it to 400 degrees F.
  Dry the tofu with paper towels and deep fry it until the cubes are firm and
  light golden, but not dry and hard.  Remove them from the oil and set aside
  to drain on paper towels.
  
  5.  Using the same oil, deep fry the noodles a handful at a time.  The
  noodles will puff up immediately and begin to turn brown in about ten
  seconds.  (Note: these are the same type of noodles that are used to make
  chinese chicken salad.)  Be careful not to let them burn.  They should be
  light golden and very puffy.  If they do not expand immediately upon
  touching the oil, the oil is not hot enough.  If they turn dark
  immediately, the oil is too hot.  Scoop the noodles out to drain on paper
  towels.  Remove about half the oil from the wok and save it for another
  use.
  
  6.  Dribble the beaten, sieved eggs over the surface of the hot oil in the
  wok, to form narrow strands: holding the bowl of eggs in one hand, dip the
  other into the eggs, stretch it out about 12 inches over the oil, and let
  the egg run in a thin, steady stream from your fingertips while moving your
  hand in a circular motion so the surface of the oil is covered wit a thin
  net of egg.  You will need to repeat this procedure about four times. The
  intent is to create a thin net of egg strands that will cook quickly
  without massing together.  When the strands are set completely and light
  golden on the bottom, flip them over carefully and brown the other side.
  Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.
  
  7.  Dry the shrimp thoroughly with paper towels.  Using the same oil, deep
  fry the shrimp until they are just crisp and light golden, about three
  minutes.  Be prepared for the very strong smell they produce as they fry,
  but don't be concerned, since the shrimp will taste nothing like they
  smell.  (You may wish to do this well in advance of the time your guests
  will arrive and set the shrimp aside to drain on paper towels.)  They will
  form a great deal of foam while they are frying, and it will be necessary
  to use a strainer to lift them up occasionally to see how well they are
  cooking.  Do not over cook them or let them get dry or hard!  Remove them
  from the oil and drain on paper towels.  Discard the remaining oil.
  
  8.  Clean the wok thoroughly and place half the sugar syrup from step 1 in
  it.  Heat the syrup almost to boiling, but do not let it boil.  Add half
  the noodles, half the egg nets (see the variation below), half the tofu,
  and half the shrimp.  Mix gently until the syrup is absorbed, being careful
  to break the noodles as little as possible.  Remove the mixture from the
  wok and place it on a serving platter.  Repeat this step with the rest of
  the syrup, noodles, eggs, and shrimp.
  
  9.  Garnish the Mee Krob with the green onion whites and chilies.  Serve
  immediately or hold it at room temperature for up to two hours.
  
  VARIATION:  If the eggs have formed attractive nets (you should be so
  lucky!), you may drape them over the Mee Krob as a garnish rather than
  adding them in step 8.

 Categories: Fruits, Preserve
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      6 lb Large nectarines (unpeeled          2 tb Fresh lemon juice
           And sliced) - 8 cups                2 c  Raspberries (1 pint)

  Combine the nectarines with the sugar and lemon juice and let stand,
  covered, overnight in the refrigerator.
  
  Place a colander in a large shallow preserving pan and pour in the
  nectarine mixture.  Let the juices drip into the pan for at least 30
  minutes.  Remove the colander with the fruit to a bowl and bring the juices
  in the pan to a boil over high heat.  Boil rapidly for 20 to 30 minutes, or
  until reduced by half.  Add the nectarines and any additional juices to the
  syrup in the pan and continue to cook voer high heat for 10 minutes.
  
  Carefully stir in the raspberries and cook for 5 minutes more.  The
  nectarines will look lightly glazed and the syrup will be only slightly
  thickened.  Ladle the preserves into hot sterilized jars, wipe the rims
  clean with a damp towel, and seal with new lids and metal rings.  Process
  in hot-water bath for 5 minutes.  Remove, cool, check seals, label, and

      Title: Pasta - Basic Recipe for Homemade
 Categories: Jewish, Italian, Pasta
      Yield: 1 servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Flour;unbleached; up to             4    Eggs;slightly beaten
           -3 cups                        
 
  Ricetta Base Per Pasta in Casa (Basic Recipe for Homemade Pasta)
  
  HAND ROLLED: Mound part of the flour in a large board or other working
  surface and make a well at center. Pour in eggs. With the aid of a fork,
  mix eggs and flour very gradually until a soft paste forms. With your
  finger mix in enough flour to make a firm but not too hard, dough. Knead
  for about 5 minutes, till dough is smooth. Place in an un floured dish;
  cover with an inverted dish and let it rest in the refrigerator for about
  1/2 hour.
    Take half of the dough, knead it lightly, and shape into a ball. Place on
  a well floured board. With the palms of your hands, flatten the ball,
  keeping the round shape, and sprinkle with flour. With the rolling pin,
  begin to thin the disk out in all directions, trying not to lose the round
  shape. Continue to sprinkle with flour as it becomes necessary, so that the
  dough does not stick to the pin. As soon as the disk of dough is thin
  enough to be rolled AROUND the rolling pin do so.* Starting from the end
  farthest from you, begin to roll the dough toward you, using small, even
  strokes back and forth, at the same time you swiftly slide your hands
  inward to the centre and outward to the edges of the pin. When the sheet is
  all rolled around the pin, PUSH the pin away from you at arm's length; then
  vigorously ROLL it back towards you, so that one  side of the sheet flaps
  several times over the board. Turn the pin 90 degrees and unroll the sheet
  from it. Repeat from * as many times as needed for the desired thinness.
  Repeat with the other half of the dough and use as directed in each
  individual recipe. SERVES: 6 to 16, depending on the different uses made of
  it
  
  WITH A HAND OPERATED MACHINE: Make a dough, using the method described
  above or by mixing eggs and flour in bowl. Knead over a well-floured board,
  mixing until they have a very firm dough. There is no need to make it
  smooth because the machine will take care of that. Place in an un floured
  dish; cover with an inverted dish and let it rest in the refrigerator for
  about 1/2 hour.
   Take 1/4th of the dough at a time and begin the thinning. With the rollers
  set at the first slot (farthest apart), feed the dough between the rollers
  while turning the crank. If some of the dough sticks to the rollers or to
  the machine, that means the dough is too soft and more flour must be added.
  Fold and feed with the rollers set at the same slot 3 or 4 times, until the
  sheet comes out in one piece (but not too smooth). Move on to the second
  slot and feed the sheet only once. Keeping on moving till the desired
  thinness is achieved. For lasagna or fettucini you stop at the next to last
  slot. For taglierini or clazonicchi, go through the last slot once, wait a
  few seconds, then feed the sheet into the last slot again. (Pasta made with
  only eggs and flour tends to be very elastic and it tends to shrink.
  However, the second time through it keeps the shape better.)
    Repeat with the remaining pasta, using 1/4th of the original quantity
  each time. Use as directed in the individual recipe.
  
  *for electric pasta makers, follow the manufacturer's directions, but most
  machines will not provide sheet pasta for lasagna, ravoli, etc.
  
  SERVES: 6 to 16, depending on the different uses made of it. SOURCE: _The

  Preheat oven to 450F.  Lightly coat an 8-inch pie pan with nonstick cooking
  spray.  Combine 1/2 c of the unbleached flour with the whole wheat flour in
  a bowl, or in a food processor bowl, and add the margarine. In the bowl,
  use a fork to crumble the flour and margarine into a coarse mixture. In the
  food processor, use the metal chopping blade and pulse the machine 10-12
  times to cut the margarine into small pieces. As you form the mixture, add
  the ice water, 1 tbspoon at a time, until the lumps appread moist. Transfer
  the dough to a board, and lightly knead it for 1 minute. Form into a ball,
  place in a small bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 10
  minutes. Sprinkle the remaining 2 tbspoons of flour on a pastry board and
  lightly coat the rolling pin with flour.  On the floured board roll the pie
  dough out in a circle slightly large than your pie pan. Carefully transfer
  the dough to the prepared pie pan. Crimp the edges of the dough against the
  rim of the pie pan. You can use this unbaked pie shell in many recipes,
  except for fruit fillings.  If you make a fruit-filled pie, you must
  pre-bake the shell so the fruit juices won't make it soggy. To pre-bake it,
  cover the crust with tinfoil, place 2 cups of clean beans or pie weights in
  the center of the crust, and bake for 10 minutes. YIELD: Makes 1 8-inch pie
  shell - Serving 8.

  :         directly over fire until upper surface begins to bubble

  instead of milk after you've added the first 1 1/2 cups of milk. Brush a
  hot skillet with oil or butter. The skillet should be well greased. Heat
  the skillet and cook the pancakes on the 1st side over med-hi heat until
  the surface bubbles; turn and cook briefly on the 2nd side. Transfer to

      Title: Purim Ravioli
 Categories: Jewish, Italian, Pasta, Misc.
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 lb Spinach;small leaves bulk                -freshly ground black pepper
           -Salt                               1 tb Flour;unbleached
      2 tb Olive oil                                Homemade pasta;made with 4
      1    Onion;small, quartered                   -Eggs & 2/12 cups flour
      1    Carrot;small, peeled &              6 qt -Water
           -coarsely chopped                   3 c  Marinara sauce;(Momma's
    1/2    Chicken breast;cubed                     -Tomato sauce) or Meat Sauce
 
  To quote the author, "I suppose that the tradition of making spinach
  ravioli on Purim originated because Purim comes in the season when spinach
  is tender, flavorful and abundant. Now we can make spinach ravioli
  throughout the year, but they never taste as good as they do around Purim."
  
  Remove the roots and stems from spinach and save for later use. Rinse
  spinach in cold water as many times as necessary to rid it of any sand.
  Place in a pot with no water other than the water the spinach retains from
  washing. Add a pinch of salt and cook, covered for about 5 minutes.
  Transfer to a colander and set aside to drain.
    Place oil, onion, carrot and chicken breast in a large skillet. Add 1 tsp
  salt and 1/8 tsp pepper and cook over moderate heat for 4 to 5 minutes
  longer or until most of the liquid has evaporated. Add flour and stir 1
  more minute. Remove from heat; cool for 5 or 6 minutes, then chop very
  fine.
    Roll the dough paper thin and place over a floured board. With a feather
  brush dipped in cold water lightly brush the top to maintain moisture.
  Place mounds of spinach mixture on the dough in straight lines about 2
  inches apart (measurements are from the centers of the mounds), making 8 or
  9 dozen of them. Roll out the other half of the dough paper thin and place
  loosely over the sheet with the mounds. With an Italian pastry wheel, press
  along the furrows, cutting and sealing at the same time.
   Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil. Add ravioli and 3 Tbsp salt. Stir until
  boiling resumes. Cook 4 to 5 minutes, uncovered. Drain and serve with
  marinara or meat sauce. SERVES: 6-8

  of beans and drain. Mash in processor or blender. Return mashed beans to
  pot along with ham hock and cook over low heat for 2 hours, until the
  mixture is creamy, stirring occasionally. (The beans should be creamy and
  juicy. Toward the end of cooking time, if the beans seem to dry, add a
  little broth or tomato juice.) When done, remove ham hock. Remove meat from
  hock and return meat to the pot. Stir to mix. Evenly divide the rice into 6
  individual serving bowls. Spoon the beans over the rice. Garnish with
  chopped onion, Tabasco sauce, and cooked sausage slices. Serve with French

  Drain, toss in a little sunflower oil and keep warm.
  
  Put the remaining oil in a pan with the onion rings and sweat gently until
  the onion is soft but not browned. Lift out the onion with a slotted spoon
  and mix with the pasta shells.
  
  Put the garlic into the oil in which the onions were cooked and fry,
  stirring for 1 minute. Mix the cooked garlic into the pasta.
  
  Toss the pasta in a warmed serving bowl or dish and sprinkle over the poppy
  seeds and seasoning to taste. Just before serving, throw in the rose

      Title: Saltimbocca Alla Genovese (From Liguria Area)
 Categories: Italian
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Veal scallops, sliced 1/4"        1/2 lb Thin slices of prosciutto
           Thick, pounded thin                      Flour
           Salt                                4 tb Butter
           Freshly ground pepper               1 c  Marsala or dry white wine
           Fresh sage, dried sage or         1/2 c  Hot beef bouillon
           Ground sage                    
 
  Trim the veal scallops so that they are approximately all the same size.
  (Save trimmings for sauces.)  Sprinkle a little salt and pepper on each
  slice of meat.  Place 2 or more leaves of fresh or dried sage on each veal
  slice, or sprinkle about a scant 1/4 teaspoon ground sage on each. Cut
  prosciutto to the same size as veal slices.  Top each veal slice with a
  prosciutto slice.  Roll up and secure with toothpicks or tie with kitchen
  thread.  Coat each veal roll lightly with flour, shaking off excess flour.
  Divide butter between 2 large frying pans; heat it  without browning. Over
  medium heat, cook veal rolls about 5 minutes, or until golden brown on all
  sides.  Reduce heat and add 1/2 cup marsala  and 1/4 cup beef bouillon to
  each frying pan.  Cover frying pans and  cook for 5 to 10 minutes longer;
  cooking time depends on the size and  thickness of the rolls. Shake the
  pans frequently to prevent sticking.  If necessary, add a little more beef
  bouillon; there should be 1 to 2 tablespoons sauce for each veal bird.
  Transfer the cooked veal birds  to a heated serving dish and spoon the
  sauce over them.  Serve  immediately and very hot with a tossed green
  salad.  6 servings.

  *do not use self-rising flour in This recipe.
  
  The food processor method is terrific for those of us who bake frequently.
  Dissolve yeast in warm water in large bowl. Stir in sugar, salt, rosemary,
  oregano, 2 cups of the flour and the oil. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough
  remaining flour to make dough easy to handle (dough will be soft). Turn
  dough onto lightly floured surface. Knead about 5 minutes until smooth and
  elastic.Place dough in greased medium bowl and turn greased side up. Cover
  and let rise in warm place 1-1/2 to 2 hours or until double. (Longer rising
  gives typical French bread texture.)Grease large cookie sheet and sprinkle
  with cornmeal. Divide dough into 24 equal parts. Roll and shape each part
  into rope, about 9 inches long, sprinkling with flour if dough is too
  sticky. Place on cookie sheet. Mix egg white and 2 tablespoons cold water.
  Brush over breadsticks. Sprinkle  with poppy seed. Heat oven to 400
  degrees. Bake about 20 minutes or until crust is deep golden brown and
  crisp. Immediately remove from cookie sheets. Store loosely covered. 2

      1 lb Bacon cooked and crumbled           1 sm Clove garlic crushed
      1 md Onion, diced                        2 tb Bacon fat fom above
      1    Green pepper, diced           

-----------------------------------PASTA-----------------------------------
      2 c  Flour                               2    Eggs
      1 ts Salt                                2 tb Water
      2 ts Olive oil                      
 
  Saute the onion and pepper. Cook pasta and drain. Add pepper, onion and
  bacon Add 2 eggs and stir over med heat until egg starts to cook. You don't
  want the eggs to become scrambled. It should be on the creamy side. Add
  pepper and parmesan to taste. PASTA: Mix the flour, salt and olive oil,
  then beat in the eggs, (a food processor, or a mixmaster does this very
  easily).  When well combined, add all of the water. Work until this becomes
  a dough ball, and then knead for two minutes, stretching out the dough, and
  folding it. Put in a plastic bag, and store in the fridge for at least a
  half an hour. Divide the dough into four pieces, and run through the
  machine, adding flour (this is a good place to work in some semolina) so
  that the dough is not sticky. After kneading on the widest setting for
  about 10/15 passes, reduce the size of the roller one step at a time until
  you reach the thinnest size. Put through the cutter of your choice, and dry
  on a rack or a line. Use fresh, or freeze unused portions. Easy, and quick
  and impresses the hell out of your guests! I sometimes add thyme, or
  oregano to my dough when mixing (about 2 t) and this adds nicely to the
  taste of the dough.

  Sylvia's comments:  This was just as easy to mix using a stand mixer and
  worked just as well as the other two. However, since it has a lot more
  ingredients and required more effort to measure than the others, I'm
  dumping it from MM.

      Title: To Cure Hams
 Categories: Penndutch, Preserve
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    100 lb Ham                                 1 ea Pt salt, kosher
      3 oz Salt peter                        1/2 lb Brown sugar

------------------------------------ALSO------------------------------------
      2 ea Pt salt                           1/8 lb Pepper
 
  *** The "recipe" specifies ham from corn-fed hogs, and "fine salt (best
  quality)". Since kosher salt is commonly available today, and contains no
  iodine, I changed the ingredients to specify it.
  
  "Rare Old Recipes on the Fine Art of Curing Meats"
  
  Mix thoroughly the salt peter, 1 pint salt and brown sugar and rub over the
  hams and let stand for 24 hours. Then rub the meat with the pepper and part
  of the remaining salt. Let stand for 5 days and then rub meat again with
  fine salt. Set aside for 30 days, hang the meat up and brush off the salt.
  Have hams smoked at a good smoke house, smoking them for 10 days with wood.
  When finished, rub entire ham with red pepper, wrap carefully in brown
  paper and then in muslin bags and hang up with the hock down. Hams prepared
  in this manner will keep indefinitely, and flavor and quality improve with
  time.

  about 6 weeks to dry thoroughly. Wrap meat in clean muslin bags and keep in
  cool place. If in 6 months meat becomes too dark, soak it in cold water for
  24 hours and wipe dry. Wrap again in muslin bags and hang in cool place.

  minutes.  Add the finishing hops during the final 1-2 minutes of the boil.
  Sparge into the fermenter and cold water.  Force cool, pitch yeast, and

  Contributed to the echo by: Stephen Ceideburg Originally from: "Discover
  Thai Cooking".Pierre Chaslin, Piyatep Canungmai, Luca Invernizzi Tettoni,
  Times Editions, Singapore, 1987 Here's the recipe for the paste if you want
  to go to the effort: Yellow Curry Paste Place the cumin and coriander seeds
  in a pan without adding any oil. Dry fry them, stirring, over medium heat
  for 1 to 2 minutes until they are slightly browned, and give off a roasted
  aroma.
  
  Coarsely chop the chilies and soak in water for 10 minutes. Drain. Pound
  all the ingredients together to produce a fine paste which goes well with
  beef and pork.
  
  You can work out your frustrations pounding the spice mix in a mortar and
  pestle or you can use a food processor if you're feeling particularly
  harmonious... Make a lot of the paste and save it for use in other curries.

      Title: Spiced Couscous
 Categories: Rice/grains, Misc.
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/4 c  Butter                          2 1/4 c  Chicken stock
    1/4 ts Cinnamon, ground                  1/2 c  Currants
    1/4 ts Cardamom, ground                1 1/2 c  Couscous
    1/8 ts Cloves, ground                    1/4 c  Cashews; or pistachios
 
  Toast and chop cashews or pistachios.  Melt butter in medium saucepan over
  low heat.  Add spices and cook 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add stock
  and currants.  Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Bring to boil. Mix in
  couscous.  Cover and remove from heat.  Let stand 5 minutes. Fluff with
  fork. Transfer couscous to bowl, add nuts and toss well.
  
  Sylvia's comments: this was good!  I was hesitant to try it because I'd
  never heard of couscous and the spices sounded weird, but it was delicious
  with just a hint of sweetness.  I don't think that much butter was needed,
  though (and I'd already cut it down!), will try less next time.

 Categories: Ethnic, Lamb
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 lb Ground Lamb                              - roasted and ground
      4 tb Fresh Asian or reg. Basil           2 ts Coarse. chopped dried chiles
           - (finely chopped)                  1 tb Light soy sauce
      3 tb Minced Fresh Coriander              1 tb Dark soy sauce
      1 tb Finely chopped Ginger               2 tb Rice wine or dry sherry
      2 ts Finely chopped Garlic               2 ts Chinese sesame oil
      1 ts Salt                              1/2 lb Caul fat or crepinette
      2 ts Sichuan Peppercorns            
 
  This is an Asian twist on a French appetizer. Caul fat can be ordered from
  your local butcher.
  
  SOAK THE CAUL FAT in a bowl of cold water; this will allow the caul fat to
  unravel easily. In a medium-sized bowl, mix the ground lamb with all the
  ingredients except the caul fat. Cut the caul fat into 20 (5-inch) squares.
  Lay out a square of caul fat and place several tablespoons of lamb mixture
  onto one end. Fold the sides in to form a package. Repeat until you have
  used up all the lamb. Recipe can be done ahead to this point and
  refrigerated. Wrap the crepinettes well in plastic wrap and refrigerate.
  Approximately 40 minutes before you are ready to cook, make a charcoal fire
  and, when the coals are ash white, grill the crepinettes for about 8
  minutes on each side, or until they are done (firm to the touch).

      Title: Buttered Saffron Rice
 Categories: India, Rice/grains
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 ts Saffron, leaf saffron               2 c  Rice, basmati
      2 tb Milk, warm                          4 tb Butter
      1 tb Salt                           
 
  "The darker (the redder) the saffron colour, the better the quality. It
  usually comes from Spain, but the best, really expensive stuff, is grown in
  Kashmir, where I went to see it growing. There are many different grades.
  Watch out for fake or dyed saffron. Buy it from a reputable source. To use
  it in a recipe, I roast it in a cast-iron pan until it's crisp to draw out
  the colour, then crumble it lukewarm milk and let it sit for three to four
  hours."
  
  Place saffron in small, dry, hot pan over medium heat about 1 minute or
  just until fragrant. Crumble into milk.
  
  Fill large pot with about 13 cups water; add salt and bring to boil.
  
  Meanwhile, place rice in medium bowl and cover with cold water. Immediately

      Title: Char-Grilled Kangaroo Kebabs and Smoked Eggplant Puree
 Categories: Australian, Meats
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    600 g  Kangaroo fillet, trimmed and        1 ts Garlic cloves, minced
           -cubed                             25 ml Lemon juice
      2 ts Coriander seeds, roasted and        1 tb Tahini

  Roll the cubes of kangaroo meat in the ground coriander seed and black
  pepper, coating lightly. Skewer meat and put on an oiled tray until ready
  to cook. Grill the eggplants until skins are black and blistered. Cool
  slightly and skin them while still warm. Squeeze out the bitter juices.
  Mash the flesh with a large fork gradually adding the garlic, lemon juice,
  tahini, sea salt, parsley and yoghurt. Grill the kebabs under (or over)
  high heat, brushing with oil to keep moist being careful not to toughen the
  meat. Spoon the eggplant puree onto the plates. Remove skewers and pile the
  meat cubes onto the puree. Serve immediately.

      Title: Coconut Milk
 Categories: Mideast, India
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lg Coconut, grated                     2 c  To 2 1/2 cups boiling water
 
  Coconut Milk is Santen in Malaysia and Indonesia.  Coconut Milk is Narial
  Ka Doodth in India. Best made from Fresh Coconuts. Grate the flesh of one
  Coconut into a bowl, pour on 2-2 1/2 c  Boiling Water, then leave to stand
  30 min. Squeeze
  
  The flesh and strain before using. This makes thick Coconut Milk, for a
  thinner milk reuse the pulp and mix the result with the thick milk, or use
  by itself for an even thinner Coconut Milk. I use an old T-shirt to squeeze
  the Coconut flesh and strain in one operation.
  
  Made from Dried Coconut Put 1 Cup unsweetened Dried Coconut into a blender.
  Pour in about 1 1/4 Cups boiling water and blend on high speed for a couple
  of minutes. Let cool for about fifteen minutes then squeeze the pulp and
  strain. Makes about 1 Cup milk. To make a thinner milk reuse the pulp.

      4    Pairs of jumbo frog's legs          2 tb Nuoc mam (fish sauce)
      1    Stalk fresh lemon grass, or         2 oz Cellophane noodles
      1 tb Dried lemon grass                   2 tb Vegetable oil
      2    Fresh red chilies, seeded           1 sm Onion, chopped
           -and sliced                         1 c  Chicken broth or water
      2    Shallots, sliced                  1/2 c  Coconut milk or heavy cream
      2    Garlic cloves, crushed              1 ts Cornstarch
  1 1/2 ts Sugar                                    Fresh ground black pepper
      1 ts Curry paste                              Coriander sprigs for garnish
      2 ts Curry powder                   
 
  This delicious lemon grass and coconut-laced curry comes from southern
  Vietnam. If you prefer a very hot curry, simply use more chile peppers.
  
  Cut the frogs' legs into bite-size pieces. Rinse with cold water to remove
  any chipped bones. Pat dry and refrigerate.
  
  If you are using fresh lemon grass, discard the outer leaves and upper half
  of the stalk. Cut into thin slices and finely chop. If you are using dried
  lemon grass, soak it in warm water for 1 hour. Drain and finely chop.
  
  In a blender, combine the lemon grass with the chiles, shallots, garlic,
  sugar, curry paste, curry powder, salt and 1 tablespoon of the fish sauce.
  Process to a very fine paste. Rub the paste over the frogs' legs. Cover and
  refrigerate for 30 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, soak the cellophane noodles in warm water for 30 minutes. Drain.
  Cut into 2-inch sections.
  
  Heat the oil in a saucepan over moderate heat. Add the onion and saute
  until translucent. Add the frogs' legs and brown well on all sides, about 3
  minutes. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover
  and simmer for 15 minutes.
  
  Uncover the pan and add the coconut milk, the cornstarch diluted in 1
  tablespoon of cold water and the remaining 1 table- spoon fish sauce. Cook,
  stirring, until the sauce thickens, about 15 minutes.
  
  Add the cellophane noodles and bring the mixture to a boil. Remove from the
  heat.
  
  Sprinkle with black pepper and garnish with coriander sprigs.
  
  Serve immediately with rice, French bread or over rice noodles.
  
  Note: Instead of discarding the upper half of the lemon grass, crush it and
  cook it with the frogs' legs for extra flavor. Remove the stalk before
  serving.
  
  Yield: 4 servings.

    1/4 c  Large dried lima beans              2 tb Flaked coconut
    1/2 tb Light vegetable oil                 2 tb Chopped fresh cilantro
    1/4 ts Cumin seeds                     2 1/2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Chopped onion                     1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
      2    Garlic cloves, peeled,            1/2 ts Paprika
           -crushed                          1/2 ts Salt, or to taste
      1    Half-inch piece fresh               1 tb Chopped fresh dill
           -ginger, peeled                
 
  Dalnas are the ingenious creations of cooks from Orissa, in eastern India.
  Traditionally, the dish is prepared with yellow mung beans, but I have
  created this recipe using readily obtainable large lima beans. To round out
  the menu, accompany this robust stew with rice pilaf.
  
  Rinse lima beans. Soak in water to cover for 6 hours, or overnight. Drain
  and rinse again. Set aside.
  
  Heat oil in a small heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add cumin, onion,
  garlic and ginger. Stir and cook until onion starts to brown, about 4
  minutes. Add tomato, coconut and cilantro, reduce heat and cook until
  tomato is soft. Transfer to a blender, add 1/4 cup of the water and blend
  until smooth. (If necessary, add more water to facilitate blending.)
  
  Combine beans, tomato-onion mixture and remaining water in a heavy 2 quart
  saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook until
  beans are tender, but still hold their shape, about 1 hour. Add cayenne,
  paprika and salt. Mix thoroughly. Garnish with fresh dill.

      1 tb Oil                                 8    Curry leaves
    1/2 c  Peanuts, unsalted, shelled          2    Spring onions, cut in 2 mm

      1 c  Coconut milk                      1/2 ts Ground cardamom
      2 c  Water                             1/2 ts Ground turmeric
      1    Lemon grass stem, 10 cm long    2 1/2 c  Long grain rice
 
  1. Heat oil in pan.  Add nuts, stir until golden; stir in coconut. 2. Add
  coconut milk and water to pan.  Stir in lemon grass, curry leaves and
  spring onions. Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 2
  minutes. Add cumin, cardamom and turmeric, bring to a boil. Add rice, cook,
  uncovered, until steam holes appear at the surface. 3. Cover pan with a
  tight fitting lid, reduce heat to very low. Cook for 10 minutes. Lift lid,
  check if rice is cooked, continue cooking if required. NOTE: Jasmine or
  Basmati rice can be used instead of long grain rice if preferred. Avoid
  lifting the lid of the pan while rice is cooking, as all the steam will
  escape, resulting in gluggy rice. HINT: The curry leaf is native to south
  east Asia and as its name suggests, lends a rich curry-like flavour to
  Asian dishes. Source: Cooking Indonesian

    1/4 ts Pepper                            1/2 lb Tender young asparagus
      5 lg Eggs; beaten until frothy                -trimmed of coarse stem ends
    1/2 lb Ground pork shoulder                     - peeled and cut into
      6 md Scallions; trimmed                       - moderately fine julienne
           - sliced thin                       2 tb Vegetable oil
           - (include some green tops)   

-------------------------------DIPPING SAUCE-------------------------------
      1    1" cube ginger                      1 tb Cider vinegar
           - peeled and minced                 1 tb Mirin (sweet rice wine)
    1/3 c  Soy sauce                           1 ts Hot sesame oil
 
  SIFT THE FLOUR, SALT, PEPPER and 2 teaspoons of the sugar into a large
  bowl. Make a well in the center and pour the eggs into it. Stir just enough
  to combine the ingredients. In a medium skillet set over moderate heat,
  stir-fry the pork, scallions, and two-thirds of the garlic in the sesame
  oil for 8-to-10 minutes, until the pork is no longer pink; do not brown the
  meat. Add the asparagus, toss for 1-or-2 minutes over moderate heat, then
  allow the mixture to cool to room temperature. In a separate bowl, combine
  the remaining ingredients, except the vegetable oil, to make a dipping
  sauce. When the pork mixture is cool, stir it into the reserved batter.
  Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over moderately high heat until
  ripples show on the skillet bottom. Half fill a 1/4-cup measuring cup with
  the batter and drop the batter into the hot oil, evening up the ragged
  edges of the pancake. Add 3 more pancakes to the skillet, smoothing the
  edges as before, and brown them for 1-to-1 1/2 minutes per side. Drain them
  on paper towels, then keep them warm on an uncovered platter in a 250F
  oven. Fry the rest of the pancakes, adding more vegetable oil to the
  skillet if needed. Serve the pancakes hot with the dipping sauce.

      Title: Kangaroo Escalopes with Spinach and Anchovy Butter
 Categories: Australian, Meats
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    600 g  Kangaroo fillet, trimmed            1 ts Lemon juice
      2 bn Of English spinach                  1 ts Black pepper freshly ground
     12    Anchovy fillets                     1 ts Sea salt
    200 g  Unsalted butter                          Olive oil
 
  "Most people won't have ever tasted kangaroo. It is a sweet, strong-tasting
  meat, it's texture and taste described as somwe- here between venison and
  liver...To eat kangaroo, you have to like game; you have to like offal and
  you have to be a red meat eater...It's a very big, very strong-tasting
  meat."
  
  These recipes are by Chris Manfield from The Paragon Cafe, Circular Quay.
  
  Slice the kangaroo fillet into thin slices, three per serve. Brush with
  olive oil and sprinkle lightly with black pepper. Remove stalks from
  spinach and wash leaves thoroughly. Plunge into rapidly boiling water for
  30 seconds. Strain and immerse immediately in iced water to stop the
  cooking process and main- tain the green colour. When cold, remove leaves
  from water and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Refrigerate until
  ready to use.
  
  Soften 100 g unsalted butter and blend in food processor with the
  anchovies, lemon juice and a pinch of sea salt and pepper until smooth.
  Scrape out onto a piece of foil and form into a sausage shape. Refrigerate
  until firm Heat a large, heavy- base, cast-iron fry pan or grill plate
  until hot. Toss in the oiled meat slices and quickly sear on each side. Do
  not turn until the first side is properly sealed--this does not take very
  long--and don't overcook. Remove meat and rest in a warm place until all
  the meat slices are cooked. In another pan, over medium heat, melt the
  remaining butter, add the squeezed spinach and the salt and pepper, and
  stir until the spinach is hot. Divide the spinach into four portions, spoon
  onto the centre of the plate, top with three escalopes. Slice the anchovy
  butter so it begins to melt over the hot meat. Serve immediately.

      Title: Kina Pie (Nz)
 Categories: New zealand, Misc.

      2 c  Fresh Kina tongue                   2    Rashers Bacon
      1 c  Breadcrumbs                    
 
  Kina or sea eggs are a staple Maori food for those fortunate enough to live
  close to the sea. Kina is found at low tide in rock crevices and under
  ledges of rock. They should only be gathered however in summer when they
  are sweet. Maori lore says it is best for them to be gathered at low tide
  on the first, second and third days after a full moon. When opened the
  shell will be found to contain a mass of fine grit and shell, a purple
  membrane and five tongues which are red. The tongues should be scraped from
  the shell with a spoon taking care not to include any membrane or grit.
  
  Method: 1. Place alternate layers of kina and breadcrumbs, into a buttered
  pie dish finishing with a layer of breadcrumbs.
  
  2. Cover with chopped bacon.
  
  3. Bake at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes until the crumbs and bacon are
  crisp and the tongues are cooked. Serves 4

      2 c  Chopped Onions                 
 
  Drop the saffron threads into a small bowl or cup, add 1/3 of the boiling
  water and soak for at least 10 minutes.  Pour the saffron and its soaking
  liquid into a deep bowl and stir in the yoghurt, caraway seeds and salt.
  Add the lamb and turn it about with a spoon until all the pieces are evenly
  coated.  Marinate the lamb at room temperature for about 30 minutes.
  Meanwhile, combine the almonds and the rest of the boiling water in a bowl,
  and soak for 10 minutes.  Pour the almonds and their soaking water into a
  blender and blend until you have a smooth paste. Set aside. In a heavy
  casserole, heat the puree over moderate heat until fairly hot. Add the
  cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves; stir for a minute or so, then add the
  onions, garlic and ginger. Lifting and turning them constantly, fry for 7
  to 8 minutes until the onions are soft and golden brown. With a slotted
  spoon, remove the lamb from the marinade, add the meat to the casserole,
  and stir over moderate heat until it browns evenly. Stir in the marinade
  and the cold water, then add the almond puree and red pepper and cook for
  10 minutes stirring occasionally.  Pour in the coconut milk, bring to a
  boil, and simmer partially covered for 20 minutes, or until the lamb is
  tender.  To serve, discard the cinnamon and cloves, mound the lamb
  attractively on a deep heated platter, and pour the sauce over it.

      Title: Mandarine Rice
 Categories: Australian, Rice/grains
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg                   2    Mandarines, zest and juice
    200 ml Raw rice                           40 g  Slivered almonds
    550 ml Water                             100 g  Sugar
      1    Carrot                            1/2 ts Saffron threads
      2 tb Olive oill                          1 tb Sultanas
 
  This celebratory rice dish is a little fiddly to make the first time, so
  save it for a weekend when you feel like cooking. Its sweetness marries
  very well with savoury foods, from the Middle Eastern braised lamb dishes
  for which it was devised to Indian curries and South-East Asian coconut
  curries.
  
  Wash 200 mL rice in several changes of water until the water runs clear.
  Then soak the rice in 550 mL water for about an hour. Drain in a sieve.
  
  Cut 1 carrot into fine diagonal slices, then julienne the slices. In a
  large pot which can go from stove top to oven, heat 2 tablespoons of olive
  oil and cook the carrots, stirring, until they are golden, then remove from
  the oil (reserving the oil in the pot) and drain.
  
  In a saucepan, make a syrup. Zest 2 mandarines then juice them and make the
  juice up to 150 mL with water. Add both zest and liquid to the saucepan,
  together with 40 g slivered almonds, 100g sugar and half a teaspoon of
  saffron threads. Bring to the boil and cook gently for about half an hour,
  stirring often, then add carrots and a tablespoon of sultanas and cook,
  stirring, for a few minutes more. The syrup should be quite thick but not
  burnt. Remove from the heat.
  
  In the carrot pot, reheat the oil and stir in the drained rice until it is
  transparent. Add 230 mL boiling water and stir gently over a low heat till
  the water has almost gone. Cover the rice with the syrup, put on the lid
  and bake in a 160-170 degree C oven for half an hour. Uncover, stir to mix
  and serve.

      Title: Mung Bean Pancakes - Bindae Duk *
 Categories: Korean, Pancakes, Breakfast
      Yield: 18 servings
 
  1 1/4 c  Hulled Split Mung Beans *           2 ts Crushed Garlic
  1 1/2 c  Finely Diced Ham Or Salt            1 ts Salt
           - Pork                            1/2 ts Black Pepper
  1 1/2 c  Chopped Kim Chee                    2 lg Eggs
      3 tb Chopped Green Onions                     Vegetable And Sesame Oils
 
  * Mung beans which have been peeled and split in half.  Substitute soy
  beans, canned chickpeas (garbanzos), or yellow lentils.
  ~--------------------------------------------------------------------- ~--
  Soak the mung beans overnight in cold water, then drain well. Place in a
  food processor, blender or mortar and grind to a fairly smooth paste,
  adding about 1 cup cold water.
  
  Stir in the remaining ingredients except the oils, beating until well
  mixed.  If you don't have any kim chee you can use finely chopped Chinese
  cabbage.  In this case, add a little chili powder to the pancake batter.
  
  Heat a heavy skillet and oil lightly with a mixture of vegetable and sesame
  oils.  Drop spoonfuls of the batter onto the skillet and cook until golden
  underneath, with small bubbles appearing on the surface. Flip over and cook
  the other side.  As they cook, stack the pancakes under a cloth until the
  remainder are done.  Serve hot or cold with chili and soy sauce dips.

  Kofta, a classic dish of Moghul origin, is one of the most important
  preparations of Indian vegetarian cuisine. Traditionally, koftas are
  simmered in a delicate sauce and turned into a curried main dish. These
  kebabs are wonderful served as cocktail appetizers with a yogurt or fruity
  dipping sauce.
  
  The kofta: Combine potatoes, peas, cheese, chile, coriander, cumin, salt,
  cashews and raisins. Form mixture into 1-inch balls.
  
  Make a batter with the flour and water. Season with pinch of salt, if
  desired.
  
  Heat oil to 375 degrees F in a deep fryer or large heavy saucepan. Dip
  balls into batter to coat completely, and deep-fry until brown (do not
  crowd), about 4 minutes. Set aside.
  
  (If you want the kebabs to remain firm, put them on a heated serving
  platter, and tent with foil. To serve, bring cream sauce to a boil and pour
  over kebabs.)
  
  The sauce: Grind cashews, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon and garlic with a little
  water to make a fine paste. Set aside.
  
  Heat butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and saute
  until wilted; stir in ground paste and cook 2 minutes.
  
  Add turmeric, paprika, coriander, cayenne and salt. Stir in half-and-half
  and water. Reduce heat and simmer about 15 minutes.
  
  (May be prepared 2 days ahead, cooled, covered and refrigerated.)
  
  Stir in cream and kofta kebabs. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat.
  Garnish with cilantro and serve immediately.

  grocery stores.

      1    To 2 tablespoons distilled          2 tb Coarsely chopped roasted
           -vinegar                                 -peanuts

      3    Eggs                                2 tb Coarsely chopped fresh
      2 tb Chopped preserved radish,                -coriander leaves
           -soaked in warm water for           2    Limes, cut into wedges
     10    Minutes, drained (optional)    
 
  Place noodles in a bowl and cover with warm water; let soak about 15
  minutes, or until soft and pliable. Drain; set aside.
  
  Set a wok over medium-high heat. When hot, add 2 tablespoons of the oil.
  Add shrimp and chicken; stir-fry until shrimp turns bright orange and
  chicken turns white, about 30 seconds. Set aside.
  
  Reheat wok over medium heat. Add the remaining oil and the garlic; brown
  gently (about 20 seconds). Increase heat to medium- high. Add the bean
  sauce, tomato paste, fish sauce, vinegar and sugar; stir until sugar
  dissolves.
  
  Increase heat to high. Break 1 of the eggs into the sauce; beat 3 or 4
  times. Let cook until egg is slightly set but still moist, about 20
  seconds. Repeat with second and third egg. There should be tiny flecks of
  egg peeking through.
  
  Add the optional radish, dried shrimp and tofu, the chile flakes, softened
  noodles and 1 handful of bean sprouts to the hot wok. Toss and lift noodles
  until tender and no longer stiff, about 3 or 4 minutes.
  
  Add the chicken broth 2 tablespoons at a time if noodles seem dry, the
  green onions and the reserved shrimp/chicken mixture; toss for 30 seconds
  to reheat. The sauce is not a wet sauce; it should "dry-coat" the noodles.
  
  Transfer to a platter and serve with a sprinkling of chopped peanuts, chile
  flakes to taste and fresh coriander leaves. Arrange. remaining bean sprouts
  and lime wedges around noodles. (Squeeze lime over noodles before eating.)
  Serve warm or at room temperature.

           Stephen Ceideburg                   2 tb Raisins
      2 c  Basmati rice                        2    Bay leaves
      8 oz Paneer (see recipe)                 1    Inch piece cinnamon stick
      4 tb Light vegetable oil                 8    Whole cloves
    1/2 c  Cauliflower florets               1/2 ts Black peppercorns
      1 c  Diagonally sliced carrots           3 c  Water
      1 c  Chopped red or green bell         3/4 c  Canned tomato sauce
           -pepper                             2 ts Salt
      2 tb Cashew halves                  
 
  In the traditional version of this dish, the rice, paneer and vegetables
  all cook together. I like the vegetables to remain crunchy, however, so I
  cook them separately, then stir them into the rice toward the end of its
  cooking time. Serve this subtle pilaf lamb chops or spicy stews.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
      8 oz Malt flour                      1 1/2 ga Water
      2 lb Glutinous rice                      1 c  Sugar
 
  Here are the two English language recipes that were on the Malt Flour
  package from the Korean market. The stuff is distributed by Hanmi, Inc and
  packed in the USA, so it may be widely available in oriental markets. I
  haven't tried these, but they looked interesting.
  
  Put malt flour into luke warm water and set aside for more than 1 hour.
  (Don't stir). Pour the upper clean water into electric rice jar, add
  steamed rice and sugar, and keep warm for about 4 hours (Do not boil). When
  a few rices begin to float, boil the juice and then cool.

      Title: Roasted Rice - Thinh
 Categories: Ethnic, Rice/grains
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 c  Rice                           
 
  Roasted rice is used quite frequently in Vietnamese cooking. We generally
  prepare a quantity of it and keep it in a jar to have on hand when needed.
  
  Heat a small, dry frying pan over high heat and add the rice. Toast,
  stirring constantly, until rice is brown. Transfer to a blender and grind
  into a powder. Store as suggested above.

      Title: Roasted Rice Powder - Thinh
 Categories: Ethnic, Rice/grains
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 c  Raw glutinous rice             
 
  Roasted rice powder is used as a flavoring and binding agent in various
  recipes throughout this book. It is necessary  to soak the rice first in
  order to obtain a deep golden color after roasting. Soaking also makes the
  rice easier to grind.
  
  Soak the glutinous rice in warm water for 1 hour. Drain.
  
  Place the rice in a small skillet over moderate heat. Toast the rice,
  stirring constantly with chopsticks or a wooden spoon, until deep golden
  brown, about 15 minutes.
  
  Transfer the roasted rice to a spice grinder or blender and process to a
  fine powder (the powder should resemble saw dust). Sift the ground rice
  through a very fine sieve into a bowl. Discard the grainy bits. Store the
  rice powder in a tightly covered jar in your refrigerator and use as
  needed. It will keep for up to 3 months.
  
  Yield: 1 cup.

  ~--------------------------------------------------------------------- ~--
  Place rice in a large saucepan.  Rinse twice to clean the rice, draining

 Categories: Thai, Rice/grains
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 c  Sticky Rice                    
 
  Sticky rice is a glutinous rice eaten by the people of the North and
  Northeast region of Thailand.  The rice is sometimes referred to as sweet
  rice because it has a sweet flavor.  It is often used to make rice wine and
  vinegar.
  ~--------------------------------------------------------------------- ~--
  Place the rice in a saucepan or bowl and add enough water to cover. Rub the
  rice between your hands several times and drain off the milky water. Add
  clean water and repeat the process until the water runs clear.
  
  Soak the rice overnight in enough water to cover or, to save time, the rice
  can be soaked in hot water for 3 hours before steaming, rather than
  overnight.
  
  Drain the rice and place in a cloth-lined steamer or in a steaming basket.
  Place the basket over a pot of boiling water, making sure that the basket
  does not touch the water.  Cover the steamer and steam for approximately 30
  minutes.

 Categories: Vietnamese, Beverages
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg                   6 oz Strong Black Coffee
      2 tb Sweetened Condensed Milk       
 
  In restaurants and cafe, dark-roast coffee is brewed in an individual drip
  pot that sits on top of a glass, slowly dripping into sweet milk. it takes
  a good 10 to 15 minutes for the water to finish dripping through, and the
  coffee is sipped at an equally leisurely pace. Both the coffee and the pots
  are available in Southeast Asian markets, but any type of coffee and any
  brew- method that produces a strong, rich-tasting cup will do.
  
  Place the milk in the bottom of an 8 ounce glass. Carefully pour in coffee,
  trying not to disturb the layer of milk. Stir milk up from bottom and sip
  coffee. There will probably be some milk left in the bottom of the glass
  when you are finished.
  
  Makes 1 serving.
  
  Variation: This coffee may also be served iced. Add ice cubes on top of the
  sweet milk and proceed as above.

      Title: Shredded Meat Tamales
 Categories: Misc., Mexican
      Yield: 32 servings
 
------------------------------------MASA------------------------------------
     32    Corn shucks                         1 ts Salt
      1 c  Lard                                8 c  Masa
      1 ts Chili powder                        3 c  Water, warm

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      1 md Onions, chopped                   1/4 ts Pepper, black
      1    Garlic cloves, crushed              3 tb Raisins; finely chopped
    1/2 ts Cumin, ground                       2 tb Oil
    1/2 ts Chili powder                        1 lb Meat, shredded
    1/2 tb Salt                              1/4 c  Water

-------------------------------COOKING WATER-------------------------------
    1/2 tb Lard                                1 pt Water
      1 ts Chili powder                   
 
  Soak corn shucks in warm water 2 hours or overnight before using.
  
  Fry onion, garlic, cumin, chili powder, salt, pepper, and raisins (if
  desired) in hot oil.  Add meat and water and simmer until liquid has been
  absorbed.
  
  Work lard, chili powder, and salt into masa; knead with hands until smooth.
  (Alternately, pour ingredients into breadmaker and start on "manual.")
  Using back of spoon, spread masa mixture thinly and evenly on inside of
  shuck, covering half the length of shuck.
  
  Thinly spread 1 tb filling mixture on masa-covered portion of shuck. Lap
  one side of shuck over the other, folding under portion of shuck which does
  not contain masa.
  
  Stack tamales, pyramid-fashion, on shallow steaming rack in bottom of large
  cooker.  Add lard and chili powder to water and pour over tamales. Cover
  with additional shucks and steam 4-5 hours.  Hint: when masa is done, it
  will pull away from shucks when unfolded.
  
  Sylvia's notes: Stokes' Green Chili Sauce with Pork, along with some
  shredded meat, makes a great quick filling.  And I steamed a batch in my
  rice cooker/steamer, for 4 hours, although I think they were done after 3.
  It was a bit of a pain because when the timer dinged at the end of an hour,
  I had to remove the steamer and drip pan and refill the water base before
  starting it for another hour, but it was still less of a hassle than trying
  to keep them from burning in a big pot. I also had to clean the base pretty
  well, as something colored from the tamales kept working down into the
  water.  And I think the masa needs a lot more chili powder to steam it over
  plain water instead of flavored water; it was pretty bland after being
  steamed.

      2    Eggs, beaten                   
 
  Grated Gruyere cheese can be used instead of cheddar cheese. Place bananas
  in saucepan and add just enough chicken stock to cover. Bring to a boil,
  reduce heat and simmer until bananas are tender, about 20 to 25 minutes.
  Using a potato masher, mash until smooth (chicken stock will be absorbed).
  Let cool slightly. Meanwhile, heat butter in a small frypan and saute
  onions until tender. Add the onions, cream, beaten eggs to cooked bananas
  until combined; season with salt, nutmeg and cinnamon to taste. Mixture
  will be quite moist. Place banana mixture in a buttered shallow baking
  dish. Combine cheese with bread crumbs; sprinkle over top. Bake at 350 for
  35 - 40 minutes or until top is golden. Serves 4 - 6. From The Gazette,

      Title: Tabasco Classic - Hot Pepper Jelly ****
 Categories: Preserve
      Yield: 6 jars- 8 oz
 
      4 lg Red Or Green Peppers, Cored       3/4 c  Cider Vinegar
           - And Seeded                    3 1/2 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Tabasco Pepper Sauce                3 oz Pouch Of Fruit Pectin
 
  We generally make our pepper jelly with aged Tabasco pepper mash from the
  factory to give it color and flavor.  Although perhaps not quite as fiery,
  this simple recipe using the pepper sauce makes a mellow, spicy jelly.
  Spread cream cheese on crackers, then top with a dollop of the jelly for a
  tempting morsel to serve with cocktails.  Pectin is available in
  well-stocked supermarkets.
  
  Cut the peppers into large pieces, then coarsely chop in a food processor
  or blender.  In a large non aluminum saucepan over high heat, combine the
  peppers, Tabasco sauce, vinegar, and sugar.  Bring to a boil and boil
  rapidly for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and
  stir in the pectin.  Return the pan to the heat and return to a boil. Boil
  the jelly for exactly 1 minute, then remove from the heat. Stirring
  frequently to prevent bits of pepper from rising to the surface, skim the
  foam off the top.  Ladle the jelly into hot sterilized jars, seal, and
  place on a rack in a deep kettle. Pour boiling water over the jars to cover
  by 2 inches and bring to a boil over high heat. Continue to boil for 10
  minutes, then remove to a rack to cool. Makes six 8-ounce jars.

  to work with and stretched well; I even played "Italian pizza maker" and
  threw the thing into the air to stretch it.  We had company for dinner, and
  when I asked for comments because I wasn't an accomplished pizza maker, one
  guest responded "you are now!"

           -Green Onion and Fresh                   -Tomato Sauce
 
  Serves 4
  
  4 green onions, chopped 2 or 3 cloves garlic, minced Extra virgin olive oil
  2 pounds fresh Roma tomatoes, peeled and seeded Fresh basil, chopped Salt
  and crushed red chile pepper to taste
  
  In large saucepan over medium heat, saute green onions and garlic in olive
  oil until golden. Add tomatoes and basil, crushing them into the sauteed
  onions and garlic as you stir. Season with salt and chile pepper to taste.
  Simmer and reduce. Toss with any cooked pasta. (I used a home-made egg
  pasta based on the bigoli recipe in Bugialli on Pasta, rolled out very thin
  and cut in long ruffled ribbons using a pastry dough cutting wheel.)
  
  Tomato tip: To peel tomatoes easily, first drop them into a pot of boiling
  water for a few seconds. The skins will slip right off.

      Title: Information About Chilies
 Categories: Vegetables, Chili
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           No Ingredients                 
 
  Chilies belong to the capsicum family, as do sweet peppers, but there the
  relationship ends, for the fiery heat of the chili is in no way similar to
  its mild-flavored relation. Fresh chilies are now widely available and vary
  considerably in size, shape and heat factor. In principle, the fatter
  chilies tend to be more mild than the long, thin varieties, and the smaller
  the chili, the hotter its taste. Generally, the unripened, green chili is
  less fiery than when ripened and red. This is a useful guide to follow, but
  there are exceptions according to the variety, so it is wise to remember
  that all chilies, irrespective of color, shape and size, are hot, so use
  caution before adding them to a dish. Bear in mind that a little chili goes
  a long way, so add a small amount to begin with and gradually increase the
  quantity to your liking during cooking.
  
  Take care when preparing chilies - the tiny, cream-colored seeds inside are
  the hottest part and, in general, are removed before using. Chilies contain
  a pungent oil which can cause an unpleasant burning sensation to eyes and
  skin, so it's a wise precaution to wear rubber gloves when handling chilies
  and be sure not to touch your face and eyes during preparation. Cut off the
  stalk end, then split open the pod and scrape out seeds, using a pointed
  knife, and discard. Rinse pod thoroughly with cold running water and pat
  chili dry before chopping or slicing as required. Once this task is
  completed, always wash your hands, utensils and surfaces thoroughly with
  soapy water.
  
  Dried red chilies are sold whole and can vary in size from 1/2-3/4 to
  1-1/2-2 inches in length, so this into account when using. If a recipe
  states small dried chilies, and you only have the larger ones, adapt and
  lessen the quantity accordingly, or to taste. Dried chilies are usually
  soaked in hot water for 1 hour before draining and removing seeds as
  described above), unless a recipe states otherwise.
  
  Dried red chilies, when ground, are used to make cayenne pepper and
  combined with other spices and seasonings, also make chili and curry
  powder, and chili seasoning. They are also used in the making of hot-pepper
  sauce and chili sauces.
  
  The Harissa spice mix uses a large quantity of dried chilies and is very
  hot, so be forewarned! This is a favorite spice mix for many Middle Eastern
  dishes. Don't be tempted to add more Harissa than recipe states, unless you
  are prepared for an extremely hot dish. A less fiery Harissa can be made
  simply by removing the seeds from soaked chilies before crushing chilies
  with other ingredients.
  
  Green chilies are available canned. These are often seeded and peeled and
  taste pleasantly hot and spicy - ideal for adding to pizza toppings, sauces
  and taco fillings. Both red and green chilies also come pickled in jars
  (hot or mild/sweet) and can be found in delicatessens and ethnic food
  shops. Canned and pickled varieties should be drained and patted dry before
  using. Whether you seed the pickled type is up to you, just remember the
  seeds are the hottest part!

      Title: Green Beans Braised with Mint and Potatoes
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 tb Olive oil & margarine, mixed        1 tb Chopped fresh parsley, opt.
      1 c  Tomato juice or sauce               2 md Potatoes; peeled
      1 lb Fresh green beans                        Salt & freshly ground pepper
           - trimmed, cut                           Chopped fresh mint
 
  Heat the fat in an enameled pan and mix in the tomato juice or sauce. Add
  the green beans and parsley to the pan with enough water to almost cover.
  Tuck the potato slices in between, partially cover the pan, and simmer for
  25 minutes, the stir and season with salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons
  chopped mint.  Cook uncovered until the beans and potatoes are fork tender,
  about 10 more minutes.  If the sauce has not thickened, pour it into a
  small pan, and boil down to one cup, then combine with the beans and
  potatoes in a warm serving bowl. Sprinkle with a little additional fresh
  mint and serve warm.  Excellent with grilled chops, fish or egg dish, but
  equally good as a main course with cheese.

      Title: Sour Lentil Soup
 Categories: Soups/stews
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 l  Brown lentils                     1/2 dl Cold water
      2 l  Water                               1 tb Flour
    1/4 l  Finely chopped spring onions      1/2 dl Vinegar (or to taste)
      1    Garlic clove (opt.); crushed             Salt
    1/2 dl Finely chopped coriander *               Freshly ground black pepper
    3/4 dl Olive oil                      
 
  *Note: Finely chopped parsley may be substituted for coriander leaves.
  
  Wash lentils in several changes of cold water, or place in a sieve and run
  water through them.  Drain.
  
  Put lentils in a large pot with 8 cups water, spring onion, garlic if used,
  oil and coriander or parsley (or a combination of the two if preferred).
  Bring to the boil, cover pan and simmer on low heat for 1 hour or until
  lentils are soft.
  
  Put water and flour in a screw top jar, seal and shake until thoroughly
  combined.  This prevents lumps forming. Pour this gradually into boiling
  soup, stirring constantly, until thickened slightly. Add vinegar and salt
  and pepper to taste.  Return to the boil, boil gently for 5 minutes, then
  serve hot.

      Title: Lobster in Tomato Sauce with Saffron Rice
 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2    Lobsters (about 2 lbs each)         4    Sun-dried tomatoes (in oil)
           - (live, or recently dead)               - pounded to a paste
     25    Saffron strands; soaked in        1/2 c  White wine
    1/4 c  Hot water                         1/4 c  Orange juice
    1/4 lb Finely chopped onion                1    Bay leaf
      1 md Leek; washed, finely chopped             Salt & freshly ground Pepper
      8 tb Fruity olive oil                  1/2 c  Finely chopped Fennel
      3    Garlic cloves; minced             1/2 c  Minced flat-leaf Parsley
      1 lb Tomatoes; skinned, seeded,          1 tb Finely chopped fresh Mint
           - and finely chopped                     Saffron Rice
 
  If you have live lobsters, plunge them into a pan of boiling water for 1
  minute, then into cold water.
  
  To prepare the lobsters, break off the claws and crack them open with a
  hammer.  Cut off the tip of the tail (with the fins), then sever the tail
  where it joins the head with a heavy knife. Cut the tail into rings,
  slicing through the shell between the ribs.
  
  Split the head open lengthwise with a hard blow of a knife and remove and
  discard the gritty stomach sac. Pour the coral (if any) and the green
  matter (which is the liver) into a stainer over a bowl, sprinkle with salt
  and pepper, and reserve.  Put the saffron to soak.
  
  In a heavy-bottomed pan big-enough to contain the lobsters and sauce, fry
  the onion and leek gently in 3 tablespoons olive oil until translucent. Add
  the garlic, chopped tomatoes, tomato paste and liquid, wine, orange juice,
  and bay leaf.  Season and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes.
  
  Add the fennel, parsley, mint, saffron and liquid, and lobster tail pieces
  and claws with their shells (but not the legs) and simmer, covered, for 10
  minutes.
  
  In the meantime push the coral and liver of the lobster through the
  strainer and beat the purie with the remaining olive oil. When the lobster
  has simmered for 10 minutes, ladle out about 1 cup sauce and beat this into
  the coral purie.  Pour this back into the pot, stir, and simmer for another
  10 minutes. Serve with saffron rice.

      Title: Chicken Braised with Cinnamon and Cloves
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 5 servings
 
      1    Frying or roasting chicken*       1/4 c  -Water to mix w tomato paste
      1    Lemon (juice only)                  1    Large stick cinnamon
      4 tb Sweet butter & oil, mixed           3    Whole cloves
    1/2 c  Dry white wine (optional)                Salt & freshly ground pepper
  1 1/2 lb Peeled, chopped tomatoes                 Fresh parsley or watercress
      1 tb Tomato paste; mixed w/ water   
 
  *Note: Chicken should be about 2-1/2 lbs., and be cut into serving pieces.
  
  Arrange the chicken parts in a glass or earthenware bowl and rub all over
  with lemon juice.  Allow to stand while heating the butter and oil in a
  heavy braising pot. Slip the chicken into the fat and cook over medium
  heat, turning with tongs to avoid pricking the flesh; saute until light
  chestnut in color.  Heat the wine in a small pan, pour over the chicken,
  shake the pan, and continue cooking over low heat. Stir in the tomatoes and
  tomato paste, slip the cinnamon and cloves in among the pieces, and cover.
  Simmer over the lowest possible heat for 1-1/2 hours, or until the chicken
  is tender and the sauce thick.  Or, transfer to a medium slow oven (325 F)
  to complete the cooking. Season with salt and pepper. Serve warm over
  cooked grain or mashed potatoes with green raw or cooked vegetables and
  chilled wine.  Garnish with parsley or watercress.

      Title: Orange Walnut Cake Athens Style
 Categories: Cakes, Desserts
      Yield: 10 servings
 
    1/2 lb Butter; sweet                       1 ts Baking powder
      2 c  Granulated sugar                  1/4 ts Salt
      4    Eggs                                1 c  Walnuts; coarsely chopped
      1    Orange,(juice & grated rind)             Confectioners' sugar (opt.)
      3 c  All-purpose flour              
 
  Cream the butter until light and fluffy, then gradually add the sugar.
  Continuing to beat, add the eggs one at a time, beating well, on medium
  speed, after each addition. Gradually add the orange juice and rind.
  Meanwhile, sift the flour with the baking powder and salt and gradually add
  to the batter.  Add the walnuts last, blend another minute on medium high
  speed, and pour into a greased and lightly floured 8-inch tube pan. Bake in
  a moderate oven (350 F) for 25 to 30 minutes until the color is a light
  chestnut and the cake springs back to the touch. (Watch carefully because
  this cake bakes quickly.) Turn onto a wire rack, round side up. Dust with
  confectioners' sugar and cool thoroughly before slicing.

      Title: Spicy Baked Syrup Cakes
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 40 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Honey                               2    Oranges' strained juice
  1 1/2 c  Sugar; granulated                   2 tb Cognac or brandy
      1 c  -Water                            1/4 ts Cloves; ground
      1 tb Lemon juice                       1/2 ts Nutmeg; ground
      1 lb Walnuts; finely chopped             1 ts Baking powder
  1 1/4 c  Butter ; softened                 1/2 ts Baking soda
      4 ts Cinnamon; ground (or more)          6 c  Flour; all purpose (or more
  1 1/2 c  Oil; vegetable                      2 oz Walnuts; finely chopped
    1/2 c  Sugar; icing                   
 
  (Author's Note): Ancient and traditional small, spicy baked syruped cakes,
  these are perfect for a large buffet. The nickname asserts their
  introduction into Greece by the Phoenicians, but not with these
  ingredients!  Within my lifetime I have seen the oil give way to butter and
  semolina succumb to flour. Combine the honey, granulated sugar, water, and
  lemon juice in a saucepan and boil for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.
  Combine the 1 pound finely chopped walnuts with 1/4 cup of the softened
  butter, 2 teaspoons of the cinnamon, and 5 tablespoons of the syrup.
  Reserve the remaining syrup and set the filling aside while you prepare the
  dough. Using an electric mixer, cream the remaining butter (1 cup) with the
  oil until light and fluffy. Gradually add the confectioners' sugar, beating
  on medium speed.  Add the orange juice slowly to the batter, along with the
  Cognac or brandy, 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon, and the other spices. In a
  small bowl, sift the baking powder, soda, and 2 cups of the flour together.
  Slowly add the flour mixture to the batter and beat for a few minutes.
  Continuing to mix by hand, add only enough remaining flour to make a soft
  dough.  Knead. Break off small pieces of the dough and shape with your
  fingers into oblongs about 2-1/2-inches long and 1-inch high. Flatten
  between your palms and place 1 teaspoon of the filling mixture in the
  center.  Work the dough around the filling to enclose it completely and
  press firmly to seal. This procedure sounds difficult, but with many hands
  it is quite simple. Place on a cookie sheet and continue until all the
  cakes are shaped.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 25 minutes, then
  cool on a rack.  Bring the syrup back to a boil. Dip each cake into the
  syrup and arrange on a platter. Sprinkle with the remaining chopped walnuts
  and teaspoon cinnamon, or more if desired. Cool before storing.
  
  Note: You may bake and cool melomakarona, store a few days in advance and
  dip in syrup as described above a day or so before serving. The flavor
  improves after a few days.

  orange juice.  Sift dry ingredients twice and fold into tahini mixture.
  Blend in walnuts and sultanas.
  
  Dust chilled cake pan with flour and turn batter into pan. Spread evenly
  and knock base of pan on table top to settle batter. Bake in a moderate
  oven for 55-60 minutes for tube pan, 45 minutes or so for slab cake. When
  cooked, invert cake in its pan onto cake rack and leave for 2-3 minutes
  before lifting pan from cake. Cool cake and cut in slices or squares to

  good shredder does this job quickly). Mix sauce ingredients in bowl.
  
  Stir-fry:  Add 1/2 of peanut oil to hot wok.  When oil begins to smoke,
  toss in garlic, ginger, shrimp & vegetables, except tomato; stir-fry on
  high heat for 2 minutes. Add sauce, & continue cooking until sauce reduces

  Rinse wok; return to high heat; when it is dry, reduce heat to medium & add
  remaining peanut oil.  Heat oil to moderate (don`t let it smoke); add curry
  powder, stirring to mix with oil. Avoid burning curry; if it burns, start
  over.  Cook curry powder for about 30 seconds. Add noodles a fist-full at a
  time, breaking noodles into short pieces. Toss noodles to coat & heat them.
  When hot, add cooked shrimp & vegetables; toss together to mix. Turn off
  heat. Add pork, egg shreds & tomato wedges; mix together. Serve. By the
  time dish is on the table, tomatoes will be hot, but still firm.

           Cornstarch for dredging           1/2 c  Dark soy sauce
      3 c  Oil for deep-frying               1/2 c  Rock sugar
      1 c  Dried chestnuts                   1/2 c  Medium sherry

      1 tb Five-spice powder)             
 
  Preparation:  At least 12 hours before cooking this dish, rinse several
  times then soak dried chestnuts. After soaking, remove pieces of skin
  wedged in nutmeat.
  
  Deep-frying:  In wok or suitable pan, slowly heat deep-frying oil; oil is

  Meanwhile, dredge drumsticks in cornstarch; shake off excess starch. Deep-
  fry drumsticks 2 at a time until brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from oil;
  drain.
  
  Red-cooking:  Pour water in sandy pot or comparable casserole dish; add 5-
  spice bouquet, soy sauce, sherry & salt (5-spice powder can be substituted,
  though the final flavor will be less distinctive). Slowly bring to boil,
  reduce heat, cover pot & simmer 15 minutes. Remove cover; discard bouquet;
  add salt & rock sugar; dissolve rock sugar. You can stop here until near
  serving time.
  
  About 30 minutes before serving time, add drumsticks & soaked chestnuts to
  hot red-cooked sauce.  Simmer in covered pot for 15 minutes; remove cover;
  simmer for another 15 minutes. Sauce should have reduced by about 1/3, and

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 lb Fryer                               1    Whole star anise
      6 lb Rock salt                           2 tb Sherry
           Parchment paper                     1 tb Fresh ginger, minced
    1/4 c  Peanut oil                          1 tb Garlic, minced
      1 ts Salt                                2    Green onions, chopped
      3 tb Dark soy sauce                 
 
  Preparation:  Wash chicken & pat dry.  Swab cavity with sherry; stuff with
  ginger, garlic & green onions; seal with clip or string. Rub outside of
  chicken with dark soy sauce; allow to stand until soy sauce is absorbed.
  Wrap chicken in 3 layers of parchment paper, tie with string, coat outer
  layer with peanut oil.
  
  Baking:  In wok or large pot, heat rock salt, stirring periodically, until
  it begins to brown.  Place wrapped chicken in rock salt, spooning some salt
  around sides & over top. Cook for about 10 minutes. Turn over chicken,
  cover with rock salt (but always have at least 2" layer of salt under
  chicken) & cook for another 10 minutes. This cooking time will give a
  moist, slightly underdone chicken.  Increase baking time to 15 minutes on
  each side, for well done.
  
  Remove chicken from salt; strip off paper; allow to stand for 15 minutes to
  cool & congeal juices.  Cut in half, then into bite-size pieces. Serve with
  soy dip.

      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 lg Chicken breast                      8    Water chestnuts
      8    Dried Nami black mushrooms          1    Chinese sausage (opt)
      2    Green onions                  

----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
      2 tb Dry sherry                          2 tb Thin soy sauce
      1 tb Cornstarch                          2    Cloves garlic, minced
      2    Slices ginger root/minced         1/2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Sesame oil                     
 
  Preparation:  Soak dried mushrooms in hot water for 1/2 hour or until soft.
  Remove stems; thinly slice caps. Debone chicken; slice into 1/2" thick,
  quarter-size coins; place pieces in shallow, heat-proof dish. Add marinade
  ingredients to chicken; marinate for at least 30 minutes. Slice water
  chestnuts in thin circles.  Cut green onions on bias into 1" sections.
  
  There are 2 varieties of "Cantonese-style" Chinese semi-dried sausage
  available in Chinese markets: duck liver & sweet pork meat. Either will do
  for this dish. Cut sausage on bias into 1/8" thick slices. Marinade is not
  used with sausage.
  
  Steaming:  Mix sliced mushrooms & water chestnuts with chicken. If desired,
  add sausage. Steam for 20 minutes. If using deep bowl, stir chicken after
  10 minutes to make certain bottom pieces get cooked. Just before serving,
  add green onions. Serve immediately, since cornstarch will become gummy if
  dish is allowed to cool.
  
  HINT: If using metal steamer, stretch dish towel under steamer cover, to
  prevent build-up of condensed steam in dish.

      Title: Steamed Whole Fish
 Categories: Chinese, Fish/sea
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Whole fish (cleaned weight)         1 tb Dry gin
           Rock cod, flounder, pomfret       1/2 ts Sugar
      2 ts Salt                                     Cornstarch paste
      4    Scallions                           2 tb Peanut oil
      1 tb Ginger slivers                      1    Sprig Chinese parsley
      1 c  Stock                          
 
  For more people, use more than one fish.  Each fish should be no more than
  2 lbs. unless you have a very large steamer. Have your fishmonger clean and
  scale fish, leaving head and fins intact. You can tell if fish is fresh by
  the clearness of the eyes and a red tint on the inner edge of the gills.
  Wash and pat dry, rub with salt. Allow to stand at room temperature for 30
  minutes.
  
  On both sides of fish, make parallel diagonal cuts 1" apart through meaty
  section.  Trim and shred scallions diagonally in 2" lengths. Peel and shred
  fresh ginger root. Place pieces of scallion and ginger in cuts.
  
  Place fish on greased plate.  Steam at rapid boil for 15 to 25 minutes,
  depending on size.  Fish is cooked when you can flake flesh. Overcooking
  will toughen flesh, so watch closely.
  
  Heat peanut oil in beaker or small saucepan.  In wok, heat stock, gin and
  sugar.   When fish is cooked, remove from steamer. Drain juices into stock
  mixture. Thicken slightly with cornstarch paste. Pour hot oil, then stock
  mixture, over fish.  Garnish with Chinese parsley. Serve.

  beancurd sticks, taking care not to break pieces. Thicken liquid slightly
  with a dribble or two of cornstarch paste. Keep stirring gently to reduce
  liquid. Remove to serving platter.

     12 md Asparagus spears              

----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
      1 tb Dry sherry                          2 ts Thin soy sauce
      1 ts Cornstarch                          1 pn Sugar

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
      2 ts Fermented black beans               2 ts Black soy sauce
      3    Cloves garlic, minced             3/4 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 ts Brown sugar                              Cornstarch paste
 
  Marinating:  With sharp paring knife, scrape chicken meat from thigh; slice
  into thin strips across the grain. (Breast meat is not preferred for this
  dish, as meat is too dry and spongy.) Combine sherry, soy, cornstarch and
  sugar in bowl; massage liquid into meat with your fingers. Marinate for 15
  to 30 minutes.
  
  Preparation:  Wash asparagus; peel tough white outer skin off ends; slice
  on diagonal in 2 1/2" sections. Rinse fermented black beans. In bowl,
  combine and mash black beans and garlic, brown sugar, black soy sauce and
  chicken stock; stir; reserve for 15 minutes.
  
  Stir Frying:  Add 2/3 of oil to hot wok; when oil is very hot, add chicken.
  Stir-fry for about 3 minutes on high heat - or until chicken begins to
  shrink and firm up. Remove chicken to holding bowl.
  
  Reheat wok to high, add remaining oil.  When oil is hot, add black bean
  sauce.  Stir-fry for 1 minute. Add asparagus; mix with sauce. Stir sauce
  with asparagus. When sauce boils, add cooked chicken; toss to combine.
  Dribble in a little cornstarch paste if needed; cornstarch in chicken
  marinade might be enough. Toss ingredients until very little liquid remains
  and is reduced to glaze. Dish is ready when asparagus brightens. If you
  still have too much liquid, remove ingredients, continue to reduce sauce,
  then return ingredients to coat them with sauce. Serve in individual
  portions.

      Title: Braised and Deep Fried Pork Slices in Wine Sauce
 Categories: Chinese, Meats
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 ts Red rice vinegar                    3    Cloves garlic, minced
      2 tb Medium sherry                       2    Egg yolks
    3/4 c  Stock                               1 ts Water
           Cornstarch paste                    1 c  Fine plain bread crumbs
  1 1/2 lb Boned pork butt                     4 c  Oil for deep-frying
      3 tb Peanut oil                    

-----------------------------------PASTE-----------------------------------
      2 tb Cooked rice                         2 tb Dark soy sauce
    1/2 ts Sugar                               2 tb Warm water
      1 ts Dry baker's yeast                   1 ts Wet bean cheese (opt)
 
  Prepare Paste:  Use mortar and pestle to pulverize cooked rice. Combine
  with sugar, yeast, soy and warm water. Let stand in warm place for 30
  minutes to activate yeast. Authentic wine lees paste is not available in
  the U.S. to our knowledge, this is the best substitute we have found. You
  can add wet bean cheese for a sharper flavor.
  
  Braise Pork:  Slice pork butt across the grain into strips, 1" by 3" by
  1/2" thick. Heat peanut oil in wok until it begins to smoke. Add some of
  pork to hot oil; stir-fry pieces until they lose their pinkness; repeat in
  batches until all pork is browned.  Next, add garlic to wok; stir briefly.
  Pour in wine lees paste, rice vinegar, sherry and stock; bring to slow
  boil; add pork slices. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.
  
  Remove pork, without sauce, to large platter.  Cool pork. Cooling is
  essential so that it will deep-fry properly. Reserve sauce in small pan.
  You can hold pork for several hours, if you wish to braise it in advance.
  
  Deep-fry Pork:  Heat deep-frying oil in wok.  While oil is heating, beat
  egg yolks with water; set out bread crumbs on platter. Dip pork pieces in
  egg mixture, then bread crumbs, to thoroughly cover.
  
  When oil is at deep-frying temperature, 375 degrees, slip in a slice of
  pork as a test: pork should lightly brown in about 1 minute. Place 6 pork
  slices on Chinese strainer, and lower into oil, strainer and all. Check in
  2 minutes (browning should take slightly longer than test because strainer
  cools the oil). If you prefer to fry in larger batches, use more oil.
  Remove fried pork to warm platter, uncovered.
  
  Finish:  Reheat sauce, and pour over pork just before serving.

      Title: Asparagus and Sesame Chicken Soup
 Categories: Chinese, Poultry, Soups/stews
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Chicken                             2 c  Warm water
      3 tb Sesame oil                          1 ts Sugar
      6    Slices ginger root                1/2 c  Button mushrooms, canned
    1/2 c  Medium sherry                       8    Fresh asparagus spears
    1/2 ts Salt                           
 
  Preparation:  Rinse chicken, remove fat pockets, pat dry, and chop into
  bite-size pieces.  NOTE:  if tempted to use breast meat without bones,
  please don`t; bones add to body and flavor of soup. Peel and slice ginger
  root.  Wash and cut asparagus into 2" sections.
  
  Braising:  Heat wok to medium hot.  Add sesame oil. Start braising chicken
  a few pieces at a time when oil begins to smell. Sesame oil will burn at
  lower temperature than other cooking oils, so avoid hot wok. After browning
  lightly, return chicken pieces to wok; add ginger slices, sherry and salt.
  When sherry boils, add water and sugar. Turn up heat, bring to boil, then
  reduce heat to simmer, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Add mushrooms and
  asparagus, simmer for another 15 minutes.
  
  Transfer to covered soup tureen (or put plate on top of soup bowl), place
  in steamer on low, and hold until ready to serve.
  
  You can make this soup in large sauce pan, if wok is needed for something
  else.

  string (don't use nylon; it might melt). Spread soft, wet modeling clay
  about 1/2" thick on sheet of newspaper.  Bring clay pack around chicken &
  seal.  Remove newspaper. (Use foil if clay unavailable.)
  
  Roasting:  Place clay-covered chicken on rack in shallow roasting pan in
  preheated oven.  Bake for 1 hour; reduce heat to 350 degrees & bake for
  another 1 1/2 hours.

      4 tb Orange honey                             (Chinese dates)
 
  Preparation:  Wash pears.  Carefully slice off the tip quarter, leaving the
  stem intact.  Core each pear through to the bottom. Make four lengthwise
  cuts from the core outward but not through the skin. If you have peeled the
  pears, do not make these cuts. Place pears in individual bowls, such as
  rice bowls or dessert dishes. Pack core with minced dates, add 1 tablespoon
  of orange honey to each pear. Replace top quarter. Hold at room temperature
  until ready to steam.
  
  Steaming:  In steamer, bring water to boil.  Place pears in their
  individual bowls on steaming tray. Steam pears for about 30 minutes,
  checking frequently to see they don't overcook and become mushy. Remove
  tray from steamer. Allow pears to cool for about 30 minutes. Serve at room
  temperature.

      Title: Greek Vegetable Casserole
 Categories: Vegetables, Casseroles
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Eggplant                            1 c  Olive oil
      2 lb Zucchini                            4 md Tomatoes
      4 md Potatoes                            2    Garlic cloves
      2    Green peppers                       1 ts Sugar
      1    Red pepper                               Salt & pepper; to taste
      2 md Onions                         
 
  (1)  Prepare the vegetables: Cut the eggplant, zucchini and potatoes
     in  bite sized chunks (do not peel the zucchini or the eggplant).
     Remove the stems and seeds from the peppers and slice them into
     strips. Peel and slice the onions. Dice the tomatoes.
  
  (2)  Saute' the vegetables except the tomatoes  in the olive oil in
     small  batches.  Saut' each batch for 2 or 3 minutes, then remove
     from the pan, trying to drain some of the oil so that enough oil
     is  left  for the next batch. When you're done, most (if not all)
     of the oil should be gone from the pan.
  
  (3)  Place the saute'ed vegetables in a  baking  dish and toss them
     briefly  so  that you won't get only one kind of vegetable in one
     place.
  
  (4)  Add the tomatoes into the pan and saut' for a couple of minutes.
     Crush the garlic and add to the tomatoes. Add the sugar, salt and
     pepper to taste and simmer for another minute.
  
  (5)  Pour the tomato sauce on top of the vegetables and bake at 350
     deg. F or until the vegetables are tender.
  
  (6)  Serve with plenty of fresh bread and,  if  you like, some feta
     cheese on the side.
  
  RATING Difficulty: easy. Time: 30-45 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
  Precision: No need to measure.

 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3 tb Bacon fat or salad oil            1/4 ts Pepper
      2    Garlic cloves, cut in half        1/4 ts Thyme OR:
      1    Veal - 1/2 leg or:                1/2 ts Savory
           -3 or 4 lb rolled shoulder          1    Bay leaf
           -of veal                            6    Potatoes - medium (6-8)
      1 ts Salt                                6    Onions - medium (6-8)
 
  Melt or heat bacon fat or oil in cast iron saucepan. Stuff the 2 cloves of
  garlic, cut in two, into incisions made in the veal. Place the meat in the
  hot fat and brown well on all sides. Don't rush this as the colour and
  flavour of the finished gravy will depend on how well the meat has been
  browned. Add the thyme or savory and the bay leaf. Place the potatoes and
  onions, whole around the meat. Don't add any liquid. Cover tightly and cook
  over medium heat till meat is tender, about 2 hours. The potatoes and
  oniions will not break as there is no liquid added. The veal will make its
  own gravy. When cooked, remove the meat from the pan to a heated platter.
  Place the pan over high heat and stir gently, so as not to break up the
  vegetables. When they are well coated with gravy, boil another minutes or
  so till the gravy has a nice consistency. This is a complete meal.

  alive.  My grandmother's recipe is, as far as I am concerned, the best
  there is." Note: from Anne - it seems as oysters were used at Christmas. My
  maternal grandmother from the American midwest had a similar Christmas
  oyster dish although hers included corn.

    1/4 c  Light cream                    
 
  "This date and nut cake always included a broiled topping. Lazy Daisy was a
  plain cake with the same topping. ... Queen Elizabeth cakes have appeared
  in cook books coast to coast for many years. Some claim that the recipe was
  a favorite of the Queen Mother and given to worthy groups as a fund raiser
  during World War II. One from Quebec's Eastern Townships includes the
  footnote that says that, "This is not to be passed on but must be sold for
  charitable purposes for 15 cents.
    In a reply to our query about the name of this recipe, the Queen Mother's
  Lady-in-Waiting writes; "I fear I have to tell you that, although we have
  known about this recipe for many years, it did not originate from either
  Buckingham Palace or Clarence House...However as Her Majesty always made it
  a rule, due to the number of requests receieved, never to give "favorite
  recipes", I fear that I have to tell you that you that should you wish to
  include this recipe in any cookbook, it should only be called a 'date and
  walnut cake' with no reference to the Queen Mother."
  
  Pour water over dates and soda; let stand until lukewarm. In bowl, cream
  butter with sugar; beat in egg and vanilla. Mix together flour, baking
  powder and salt; add to creamed mixture alternately with date mixture.
  Spread in a greased and floured 9 inch square cake pan. Bake in 350F oven
  for 40 minutes or until tester comes out clean.
  
  Broiled Topping: In a small heavy saucepan, combine butter, packed brown
  sugar, light cream and coconut (half nuts if desired). Bring to a boil,
  stirring; boil gently for 1 minute. Spread over warm baked cake; broil
  until bubbly and lightly browned, watching carefully.

--------------------------------CATE VANICEK--------------------------------
     10    Chicken wings (yield 20           1/3 c  Cornstarch--mixed with:
           "Drumsticks)                        1 ts Baking powder
      1    Egg white, slightly beaten               Peanut oil for deep frying

----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
      1 ts Five-spice powder                 1/2 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts MSG (optional)                      1 ts Rice wine
      1 ts Salt                                1 ts Soy sauce
 
  Discard wing tips.  Cut between joints.  Remove the smaller bone of the
  lower wing.  Cut skin loose around the small end and push skin and meat up
  to form drumstick.
  
  Marinate wings for 1 hour.  Add egg white.  Coat wings evenly. (Using egg
  white to coat the wings will help to seal the juice inside the meat. Hence
  the meat will be juicier.
  
  Dredge wings in cornstarch mixture.  (Using cornstarch and baking powder
  helps to make the outside layer crisp.)
  
  Deep-fry for 3 minutes.  Drain.  Let cool.
  
  Deep-fry once again right before serving.  (Deep-fry the first time to cook
  the meat and seal the juice in the meat. The second time to make the
  outside crisp. Make sure the oil is very hot before you deep-fry for the
  second time.)

  and slightly thinner.  You may substitute won ton skins by merely cutting
  off the corners to round off the skin.

      Title: Oriental Noodles with Chilli and Cashews
 Categories: Pasta, Vegetables, Chinese
      Yield: 2 servings
 
  13/16 c  Plain flour                     1 1/3    Eggs
           Pinch of salt                     1/3    Egg

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
    1/3 ts Vegetable oil                    3/16 c  Malt vinegar
    1/3 sm Red chilli                       1/16 c  Cashew paste
    1/3    Spring onion                      1/3 tb Lime juice
 83 1/3 g  Snow peas                         1/3 ts Lime rind
   3/16 ts Sesame oil                        1/3    Red Chilli
   1/16 c  Light soy sauce                  3/16 c  Roasted Cashews
 
  Preparation: Lightly beat the eggs (keep the 4 and the 1 separate)
  
  Finely chop one of the chillis, and the spring onion. Thinly slice the snow
  peas. Finely shred the lime rind and the second red chilli.
  
  As an alternative to making your own noodles, chinese thread noodles are a
  suitable (but not as nice!) substitute, as is tagliatelle.
  
  1. To make the noodles sift the flour and salt into a bowl.
     Make a well in the centre and add the 4 beaten eggs, gradually
     importing into the flour with a fork. Turn onto a lightly
     floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic (about 5
     minutes). Cover and stand for 30 minutes.
  
  2. Divide the dough into 4 portions. Cover with a tea towel. Roll one
     portion of the dough to 3mm thickness using a rolling pin or sharp
     knife. Roll up the sheet of pasta completely and cut into 5mm wide
     strips. Carefully unroll the strands.
  
     Repeat the process with the remaining portions of dough. Spread onto
     a dry tea towel and sprinkle with plain flour. Set aside.
  
  3. Prepare the sauce whilst the pasta is standing. Heat the oil in a pan
     and add the chilli, spring onion and snow peas. Cook over a low heat
     for 2-3 minutes. Add the sesame oil , soy sauce, vinegar, cashew paste,
     lime juice and rind. Stir to combine. Cook, stirring, over a gentle
     heat for 3-4 minutes.
  
  4. Cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling water until just tender.
     Drain, spoon over the sauce and toss to combine. Sprinkle over
     shredded chilli, cashews and serve.

      Title: Aromatic Duck
 Categories: Poultry, Chinese
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Duckling                            1 tb Kosher salt
      2 ts Peppercorns                         1 tb Sugar, brown
      1 ts Thyme, whole dried                  1 tb Brandy
      2    Bay leaf; crumbled                  1    Garlic clove
      6    Cloves                              5    Red cabbage leaves
 
  Cut off the wingtips from the duck and wrap them up with the giblets for
  making stock.  Pull out and discard any loose interior fat. Rinse the duck
  inside and out and pat dry, inside and out. Mix together in a spice mill or
  mortar the peppercorns, thyme, bay leaves, cloves and salt. Grind to a fine
  texture. Combine in a small dish with the brown sugar and brandy. Place the
  duck in a heavy plastic bag that fits snugly. Rub half the spice mixture
  inside the duck and the remaining half over the outside. Place the garlic
  in the duck's cavity. Close the bag tightly and refrigerate 24 hours,
  rubbing the surface and squeezing in the spices occasionally. Remove the
  duck from the bag and gently pat it dry. Set it on a cake rack over a plate
  and return it, uncovered, to the refrigerator for another 24 hours or so,
  turning it once. Pat the duck to dry it thoroughly (if not already dry) and
  let it come to room temperature (at least two hours). Preheat the oven to
  300. Using a large needle and white cotton thread, sew closed the neck and
  tail openings.  Place the duck on its side on a rack set in a roasting pan.
  Roast the duck for 45 minutes. With the needle, prick the fatty parts on
  the upper side; do not prick deeply enough to pierce the flesh. Grab the
  duck by the legs and turn it over onto the other side. Increase the oven
  temperature to 350 and roast 30 minutes. Price the fatty parts on the
  upturned side and then turn the duck onto its breast. Increase the heat to
  400 and roast about 30 minutes longer, or until the duck is deeply browned
  and most of the fat has melted away. Remove from the oven and let cool 1 to
  3 hours before serving. To serve: Using a heavy cleaver or poultry shears,
  cut through flesh and bone of the duck carefully to make about 12 to 14
  serving pieces, keeping the skin neatly intact on each piece. Spread the
  cabbage leaves over a platter, shallow basket or wooden bowl and arrange
  the duck on them. If the duck is to be served hot, arrange the cut pieces
  in a pan in a single layer, cut side down, and roast in a preheated 350
  oven 15 minutes.

  1 1/2 ts Salt                              1/2 ts Turmeric
 
  Grind cumin seeds,  red chilies,  peppercorns, cardamom seeds, cinnamon,
  black  mustard  seeds and fenugreek seeds in a coffee-grinder or other
  spice grinder. Put the ground spices in a bowl. Add the vinegar, salt and
  sugar.  Mix and set aside. Heat the oil in a wide, heavy pot over a medium
  flame.   Put in the onions. Fry, stirring frequently, until the onions turn
  brown  and crisp. Remove the onions with a slotted spoon and put them into
  the container of an electric blender or food processor. (Turn off the
  heat.) Add 2-3 tablespoons of water to the blender and puree the onions.
  Add this puree to the ground spices in the bowl. (This is the vindaloo
  paste. It may be made ahead of time and frozen.) Dry off the meat cubes
  with a paper towel and remove large  pieces  of fat, if any. Put the ginger
  and garlic into the container of an electric blender or food processor. Add
  2-3 tablespoons of water and blend until you have a smooth paste. Heat the
  oil remaining in the pot once again over a medium-high flame. When hot, put
  in the pork cubes, a few at a time, and brown them lightly on all sides.
  Remove each batch with a slotted spoon and keep in a bowl. Do all the pork
  this way. Now put the ginger-garlic paste into the same pot. Turn down the
  heat to medium. Stir the paste for a few seconds.  Add the coriander and
  turmeric.  Stir for another few seconds. Add the meat, any juices that may
  have accumulated as well as the vindaloo paste and the water. Bring to a
  boil.  Cover and simmer gently for an hour or until port is tender. Stir a
  few times during this cooking period. Serve with rice.

  1 1/2    Whole dried hot red chili       2 1/4 ts Salt
      3 c  Grated fresh coconut           
 
  Put the coriander seeds,  cumin seeds,  mustard seeds, cinnamon, cloves,
  peppercorns,  nutmeg  and red chili in a small frying pan. Place over a
  medium  flame.
   Now  quickly  'dry-roast'  the  spices,  stirring them frequently until
  they emit a very pleasant 'roasted' aroma. Empty the spices into a clean
  coffee grinder or spice grinder and  grind  until fine. Put spiced in bowl.
  Put the coconut into the same frying pan and dry roast it over a medium
  flame, stirring all the time. The coconut should pick up lots of brown
  flecks and also smell roasted. Put the coconut in the bowl with the other
  dry roasted spices. Put the garlic, ginger, and green chili into the
  container  of  an electric blender, along with some water. Blend until you
  have a paste. Heat the oil in a 10-12 inch frying pan or saute pan over a
  medium high flame. When hot put in the onions. Stir and fry them until they
  pick up brown spots. Now pour in the garlic-ginger mixture and stir once.
  Turn heat to medium. Put in the chicken pieces, salt, as well as the spice
  coconut mixture in the bowl. Stir and fry the chicken for 3-4 minutes or
  until it loses its pinkness and turn heat to low, and cook for 25 to 30
  minutes or until chicken is tender. Stir a few times during this cooking
  period, making sure that you turn over each piece of chicken so that it
  gets evenly colored.

      Title: Pour la France's Fudge Caramel Cake
 Categories: Cakes, Desserts, Sauces
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      2    9-inch layers of choc. Cake       1/3 c  Light Corn Syrup
      1    Fudge Icing (Recipe)                1 c  Brown Sugar, firmly packed
      1    Caramel Sauce (Recipe)              2 ts Butter
  1 1/2 c  Cashews, roasted, unsalted        1/8 ts Salt
      2 c  Heavy Cream                       1/3 c  Heavy Cream
  2 1/2 lb Semisweet Chocolate            
 
  FOR CAKE:
     Slice round cake layers horizontally in half to make 4 round cake
  layers.  Place 1 layer on plate and top with Fudge Icing, Caramel Sauce and
  Cashews. Repeat with next 2 cake layers. Place final cake layer on top,
  frost top and sides of cake with Fudge Icing and cover sides of cake with
  chopped cashews. FUDGE ICING: Bring cream to boil. Stir in chocolate until
  melted and smooth. This will be very soft but will harden when cooled.
  Refrigerate until workable consistency. NOTE: The time it takes to get to a
  workable consistency depends on the weather. This is much like making fudge
  candy. The author, (Arlene Lightsey), made this sauce on a cool, clear day
  and had no problem. CARAMEL SAUCE: Bring first 4 ingredients to boil and
  reduce to thick syrup. Very carefully, (because it will splatter), add
  cream. Refrigerate until cool. Recipe from Pastry Chef Jenny Mattingsley,
  of Pour la France, 7959 Broadway, San Antonio, Texas......

      Title: Filled Berlin Doughnuts
 Categories: Breads, Desserts
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      1 pk Active Dry Yeast; OR                2 ts Rum Extract
      1 tb Active Dry Yeast; Bulk              1 c  Milk; Scalded
    1/4 c  Warm Water; (110-115 Deg F)              Unbleached Flour; *
    1/2 c  Sugar                               2    Eggs; Lg, Well Beaten
      1 ts Salt                                     Fat For Deep Frying; **
    1/3 c  Butter Or Regular Margarine              Jam Or Jelly
      1 tb Orange Juice                   
 
  *    Use up to 4 cups of Unbleached Flour in this recipe. ** Heat the fat
  to 375 degrees F. for frying the doughnuts. Soften the yeast in the warm
  water and let stand for 5 minutes or until it "blooms" or proofs. Put a
  half cup of sugar, the salt, butter, orange juice and rum extract in a
  large bowl.  Pour the scalded milk over the ingredients in the bowl. Stir
  until the butter is melted.  Cool to lukewarm. When cool, blend in 1 cup of
  the unbleached flour and beat until smooth. Stir in the yeast and add about
  half of the remaining flour, beating until smooth. Beat in the eggs. Then
  beat in enough of the remaining flour to make a SOFT (should be slightly
  sticky and light in weight). Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured
  board and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Knead until smooth and elastic
  (about 8 to 10 minutes). Form into a ball and put into a greased bowl,
  turning to grease the top of the ball of dough. Cover and let rise in a
  warm draft free place until doubled in bulk. Punch the dough down, kneading
  lightly to remove all of the air pockets, and turn the dough out onto a
  lightly floured surface. Roll to 1/2-inch thickness. Cut the dough into
  rounds using a 3-inch biscuit or cookie cutter. Cover with waxed paper and
  let rise on the rolling surface away from drafts and direct heat, until
  double in bulk, (30 to 45 minutes). About 20 minutes before frying, heat
  the fat.  Fry the doughnuts in the heated fat. Put only as many doughnuts
  at one time as will float uncrowded in a single layer deep in the fat. Fry
  2 to 3 minutes or until lightly browned; turn the doughnuts with a fork or
  tongs, being careful not to pierce the doughnut, when they rise to the
  surface. Do this several times during the cooking. Lift from the fat,
  draining for a few seconds over the fat before removing to absorbent paper
  toweling. Cool. Cut a slit through the center in the side of each doughnut.
  Force about 1/2 ts of jam or jelly into the center and press lightly to
  close the slit. (A pastry bag and tube may be used to force the jelly or
  jam into the slit.) Shake 2 or 3 bismarks at one time in a bag containing
  granulated or powdered sugar. (Your choice.) Shake lightly to remove the
  excess sugar.

  [Looking at the ingredients, I figure that this'll feed 4 as a main course
  or 8 as an appetizer.  -- mkm] Preparation 1 1/2 hours. Cooking 1 1/4
  hours. Cook the snails in advance in a court bouillon, then remove them
  from their shells. [There's a description of court bouillon in "Joy of
  Cooking."  Basically, a court bouillon is an aromatic liquid or stock,
  sometimes containing wine, vinegar or lemon juice, used mainly for cooking
  fish and shellfish, but also sometimes white offal (variety meats) and some
  white meats. -- mkm] Chop them, together with the peeled shallots and a
  small bunch of well-washed chives. Place these ingredients in a saucepan
  with the wine, cover and simmer for 1 hour. Meanwhile, soak the frogs' legs
  in the milk for 1 hour.  Drain them, then roll in flour and saute in the
  butter in a frying pan over a brisk heat for 10 minutes. Add the snails,
  together with their cooking juices, and season with salt and pepper.
  [Personally, I prefer to mill the pepper at the dinner table. The smell of
  the freshly ground pepper would otherwise be lost. -- mkm] Turn up the heat
  and cook for a further 5 minutes. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve.

      Title: Brown Sugar Fudge
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 c  White Sugar; Granulated             2 oz Unsweetened Chocolate; 2 Sqs
      1 c  Light Brown Sugar; Firm Pack        4 tb Butter; 1/2 stick
    1/2 c  Heavy (Whipping) Cream          1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      3 tb Molasses; *                       1/2 c  Chopped Nuts; Optional
 
  *    This is to taste.  The original recipe called for 4 Tbls of Molasses,
  STEP 1:  PREPARE: Prewarm the thermometer in hot water; use a 2-quart
  saucepan; butter the upper sides (inside) of the saucepan; measure all
  ingredients except the vanilla and optionals, and dump into the saucepan.
  Grease and if necessary, line a 5 X 10-inch pan. Fill glass with ice cubes
  and water and the sink with 1/2 inch of cold water. STEP 2: Dissolve the
  sugar, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, over low heat until the
  butter melts, the gritty sounds cease, and the spoon glides smoothly over
  the bottom of the pan.  Increase the heat to medium and bring to a boil.
  STEP 3: Boil, after washing down any crystals that may have formed, with a
  pastry brush dipped in hot water from the thermometer bath, using as little
  water as possible. Introduce the prewarmed thermometer. Reduce the heat
  while keeping the fudge at a boil. Stir no more than necessary. STEP 4:
  Test the fudge mixture in the ice-cold water when the mixture thickens and
  bubbles become noisy. Ball, formed in ice water, should hold its shape
  until the heat from your had begins to flatten it and should be al dente ~-
  slightly chewy -- between 230 and 240 (110 and 115.5 degrees C.). Because
  of the molasses and brown sugar, it can ball at a lower temperature than
  some other fudges. STEP 5: Shock by placing the saucepan in the cold water
  in the sink. STEP 6: Seed by adding, without stirring, the vanilla. Then
  allow to cool. STEP 7: Stir when luke warm and "skin" forms on the top (110
  degrees F.(43.5 degrees C.)). Return the thermometer to its hot water bath
  to soak clean. Stir the fudge thoroughly but not vigorously by hand, with
  an electric mixer, or with a food processor. Pause frequently to allow the
  fudge to react. STEP 8: Watch for the fudge to thicken, lose its sheen, and
  become lighter in color or streaked with lighter shade, give off some heat,
  suddenly stiffen. If mixing by had, the fudge will "snap" with each stroke;
  by mixer, mixer waves will become very distinct, by food processor, fudge
  will flow sluggishly back to the center when the processor is stopped. STEP
  9: Add the optionals (1/2 Cup Chopped Nuts (walnuts, pecans, or hazelnuts
  (filberts)) before the fudge totally candies. STEP 10: Pour, score, and
  store when cool in an airtight container in the refrigerator or at room
  temperature. YIELD: 1 pound of fudge. Recipe is easily doubled and can be
  frozen. VARIATIONS: HONEY BROWN SUGAR FUDGE: In Step 1, eleminate the
  unsweetened chocolate and replace the molasses with 1/4 cup of honey. The
  honey causes the fudge to ball at a higher temperature. CHOCOLATE HONEY
  BROWN SUGAR FUDGE:  In Step 1, replace the heavy cream with light cream or
  evaporated milk and replace the molasses with 1/4 cup of honey. ORANGE
  BROWN SUGAR FUDGE: In Step 1, eleminate molasses, chocolate but add 1 Tbl
  corn syrup.  In Step 6, add 1 Tbl grated orange zest, plus if you can get
  it, 1 tsp of pure orange extract. PEANUT BUTTER BROWN SUGAR FUDGE: In Step
  1, eliminate the molasses and chocolate, replace the heavy cream with 1/4
  cup of milk and 1/4 cup of creamy peanut butter. To intensify the peanut
  butter flavor, add 1/3 of a cup of salted peanuts in Step 9. PRALINE BROWN
  SUGAR FUDGE:  In Step 1, eliminating the molasses is optional -- you'ss get
  a more Southern praline with it, a milder one without it--or compromise and
  use only 1 Tbls.  Eliminate the chocolate. In Step 3, when the mixture
  begins to thicken, add 1 1/2 cups of pecan halves slowly so as not to break
  the boil or cool the mixture too quickly.

      Title: Basic Stock - Prudhomme
 Categories: Cajun, Soups/stews
      Yield: 1 servings
 
-----------------------------------BASIC-----------------------------------
      2 qt Cold water                          1    Large clove garlic (note)
      1    Med. onion, (see note)                   Bones, excess meat (notes)

----------------------------FOWL AND GAME STOCKS----------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Backs, necks, bones (notes)   

----------------------------BEEF OR TURTLE STOCK----------------------------
      2 lb Beef shank (see notes)        

---------------------------------PORK STOCK---------------------------------
      2 lb Pork neck bones (see notes)   

-------------------------------SEAFOOD STOCK-------------------------------
      2 lb Rinsed shrimp heads (notes)    
 
  Notes:  To the basic stock, you can also add vegetable trimmings from the
  recipe(s) you are serving, in place of the onion, garlic and celery.  The
  recipe calls for the onion and garlic to be unpeeled and quartered.
     Also, you may include bones and any excess meat (excluding livers) from
  meat or poultry, or shells or carcasses from seafood, used in the recipe(s)
  you're cooking, or FOR FOWL AND GAME STOCKS: 1 1/2 to 2 pounds backs, necks
  and/or bones from chickens, guinea hens, ducks, geese, rabbits, etc. FOR
  BEEF OR TURTLE STOCKS: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds beef shank (preferred) or other
  beef or turtle bones. FOR PORK STOCK: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds pork neck bones
  (preferred) or other pork bones. FOR SEAFOOD STOCK: 1-1/2 to 2 pounds
  rinsed shrimp heads and/or shells, or crawfish heads and/or shells, or crab
  shells (2-1/2 to 3 quarts), or rinsed fish carcasses (heads and gills
  removed), or any combination of these. (you can also substitute oyster
  liquor for all or part of seafood stock called for in a recipe). NOTE: If
  desired, you can first roast meat bones and vegetables at 350F until
  thoroughly browned.  Then use them to make your basic stock.  (When you
  brown the bones and vegetables, the natural sugar in both caramelizes on
  the surface, which gives the stock a fuller taste and adds color when it
  dissolves in the stock water.) Always start with cold water--enough to
  cover the other stock ingredients.
   Place all ingredients in a stock pot or a large saucepan.  Bring to a boil
  over high heat, then gently simmer at least 4 hours, preferably 8 (unless
  directed otherwise in a recipe), replenishing the water as needed to keep
  about 1 quart of liquid in the pan.  The pot may be uncovered, or set the
  lid on it askew.  Strain, cool and refrigerate until ready to use.
   (Note: Remember if you are short on time, using a stock simmered 20 to 30
  minutes is far better than using just water in any recipe..) TO MAKE A RICH
  STOCK: Strain the basic stock, then continue simmering until evaporation
  reduces the liquid by half or more.  For example, if your recipe calls for
  1 cup "Rich Stock," start it with at least 2 cups of strained basic stock.
  (Rich stocks are needed when a sauce requires lots of taste but only a
  limited amount of liquid, for example, "Oyster Sauce for Beef." From The
  Prudhomme Family Cookbook

      1    Bay leaf                          1/2 c  Uncooked white rice
      1    Medium onion, quartered                  Salt & freshly ground black
      1    Whole clove                              Pepper
      2    Ripe tomatoes, quartered            3    Carrots, thinly sliced on

  3.  Add the rice, salt, and pepper to the broth and simmer for 10 minutes.
      Add the thinly sliced carrots and celery to the soup with the shredded
      chicken and half the parsley.  Simmer the soup for another 10 minutes,
      or until the rice is tender.  Correct the seasoning, adding salt and
      pepper to taste.  Sprinkle with the remaining parsley and serve at
      once.

  1 1/2 lb Fresh Okra                          1 ea Fresh tomatoe, or 16 oz can

   Cut up chicken, remove skin if ya like. Dredge the chicken with flour salt
  and pepper. Fry the chicken until brown. Slice up a pound of the link
  sausage... for a hotter sausage, try the Louisiana 'Andouie', if available.
  After the chicken is browned, place sausage in the same skilett... use a
  heavy iron one. Brown the sausage, on both sides. Save the grease from
  chicken and sausage.
   Fry the tomatoe, onion and okra in about 2 T shortening or oil, until they
  become tender.
   Make a roux with 2 ts oil and 2 ts flour, stir and brown over a medium-low
  heat until the roux is as dark as possible without burning it. Do not burn
  the roux... just make it real dark.
   Place chicken and sausage in the roux, stir a bit. Then place all
  ingredients into a heavy, deep iron pan, add water and cook about 2 hours.
  Cook slow, add water if needed. The okra will thicken the gumbo as it

  1 1/2 lb Andouille sausage; or kielb         1 c  Flour
  3 3/4 c  Onions; chopped                     2 c  Celery; chopped
      2 c  Green pepper; chopped               3 ts Garlic; chopped
  8 1/2 c  Chicken stock                       1 x  Salt
      1 x  Cayenne pepper                      2 c  Green onion; chopped
      1 x  File                                1 x  Cream sherry
      1 x  Cooked rice                    
 
  Season and brown chicken in oil (lard, bacon drippings) over med-hi heat.
  Add sausage (cut in 1/4" rounds) to pot and saute with chicken. Remove both
  from pot. Make roux with equal parts of oil and flour to desired color (I
  make a dark chestnut color). Add onions, celery, green pepper, and later
  garlic to roux, stir continuously until vegetables reach desired
  tenderness. Return chicken and sausage to pot and cook with vegetables,
  continuing to stir frequently. Gradually stir in liquid and bring to boil.
  Reduce to simmer and cook for an hour or more.  Season to taste.
  Approximately 10 minutes before serving, add green onions. Gumbo may or may
  not be served over rice.  Adding sherry at the table is also an option.
  File may be placed on the table for individuals to add to their gumbo if
  they wish.  1/4 to 1/2 tsp per serving is recommended. File - a fine green
  powder that is young dried and ground sassafras leaves, used in gumbo for
  flavor and thickening.  The word file means to twist or make threads. If
  you put the file directly into the gumbo while it is cooking, that is what
  you will end up with, a liquid that is rather stringy as you bring your
  spoon out of the bowl. Ugh!  Do it right, let each person add their own at
  the table. If making roux over very high heat, the oil you use must be free
  of food particles to avoid burning. If you scorch your roux, even slightly,
  while you are making it, throw it out, and start over again after you have
  thoroughly cleaned the pot. When making an okra gumbo, add 4-6 cups of cut
  okra to trinity, saute, and cook together with roux. (remember, the Cajun
  cooking trinity is onions, celery and green pepper).

  COMBINE CHICKENS AND WATER in a 5-quart stockpot. Cover, bring to a boil
  over high heat. Reduce heat to low and skim off the scum that accumulates
  on the surface. Remove chicken breast quarters and set aside. Add 2 cups
  carrots, 1 cup onions, 2 cups celery, green leek tops, peppercorns, bay
  leaves, thyme and salt. Cover and simmer for 45 minutes. Remove cover,
  replace the chicken breasts and continue to cook for another 25 minutes.
  Meanwhile, slice the white parts of leeks into 1/4-inch rounds and wash
  well to remove any sand. You should have about 1 cup. Melt the butter in a
  medium saucepan over medium heat and add the leeks and the remaining
  carrots, onions and celery. Cover and cook gently until vegetables are
  soft, about 5 minutes. Remove the chicken from the liquid and place on a
  platter. Strain the liquid through a fine strainer into a large plastic
  container and discard the herbs, spices and the cooked soup vegetables.
  Skim and discard any fat from the surface of the broth. Remove and discard
  chicken skin. Remove the meat from the bones, dice it and set aside. Place
  bones in an airtight freezer container and save for making stock.
  Immediately prior to serving, transfer broth to a pot and heat, covered,
  over high heat. Heat chicken and vegetables, covered, in 350F oven until
  hot. Decorate each soup bowl with some heated diced vegetables and chicken.
  Pour the hot broth into a pitcher or soup tureen and pour the soup into the
  garnished bowls at the table.
