Alheiras De Mirandela

meats

3 pound lean beef*
1 1/2 pound calf meat
1/2 pound chicken
1/2 pound turkey
1/2 pound rabbit
1 1/2 pound day old wheat bread
1/4 pound ham (optional)
4 garlic cloves
4 teaspoon olive oil
2 ounce pork drippings**
1  paprika, salt and piripiri to taste
10 feet tripe casing

*    Or lean pork, or a mixture of both, for cost reasons. **
Probably a modern addition, or replacement for suet. You may change
the proportions of chicken/turkey/rabbit - it may be all chicken,
etc., provided the total amount remains the same. You can use
partridge, quail, duck, and so on... Boil the meats together long
enough to make the bones separate from the meat by themselves.
Reserve the resulting broth and set meats aside. In a large bowl
place the thinly sliced bread and add the reserved broth. Cover with
a towel and, as soon as the bread is soft enough, mash it with an
wooden spoon. Add the mashed garlic and ground piripiri, paprika and
a little salt. Add the meats cut in very little pieces. Mix
thoroughly. When everything is completely mixed add the olive oil and
the pork drippings, hot. Fill the casing using a suitable funnel. Tie
each 'alheira' so that it's about 8" long, with the filling
concentrated in the middle section, leaving the ends almost empty.
Smoke for 2 or 3 hours a day, for a week. Tie both ends together
before selling or using - the 'alheira' should be U shaped. A typical
way of serving 'alheiras' is frying them in hot oil, and presenting
them with fried eggs and potato chips. Some add broccoli as a side
dish.

Andouille Sausage, Homemade

makemeat, pork, ethnic

1 1/2  yards large sausage casing,
1  approximately  (about 2-3
1  inches wide)
4 pound lean fresh pork
2 pound pork fat
3 1/3 tablespoon finely minced garlic
2 tablespoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon cayenne
1/8 teaspoon chili powder
1/8 teaspoon mace
1/8 teaspoon allspice
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 tablespoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon ground bay leaf
1/4 teaspoon sage
5 teaspoon colgin's liquid hickory
1  smoke

Andouille was a great favorite in nineteenth-century New Orleans. This
thick Cajun sausage is made with lean pork and pork fat and lots of garlic.
Sliced about 1/2 inch thick and greilled, it makes a delightful appetizer.
It is also used in a superb oyster and andouille gumbo poplular in Laplace,
a Cajun town about 30 miles from New Orleans that calls itself the
Andouille Capital of the World.

(about 6 pounds of 20 inch sausage, 3 to 3 1/2 inches thick)

Soak the casing about an hour in cold water to soften it and to loosen the
salt in which it is packed.  Cut into 3 yard lengths, then place the narrow
end of the sausage stuffer in one end of the casing. Place the wide end of
the stuffer up against the sink faucet and run cold water through the
inside of the casing to remove any salt.

(Roll up the casing you do not intend to use; put about 2 inches of coarse
salt in a large jar, place the rolled up casing on it, then fill the rest
of the jar with salt. Close tightly and refrigerate for later use.)

Cut the meat and fat into chunks about 1/2 inch across and pass once
through the coarse blade of the meat grinder.  Combine the pork with the
remaining ingredients in a large bowl and mix well with a wooden spoon. Cut
the casings into 26 inch lengths and stuff as follows: Tie a knot in each
piece of casing about 2 inches from one end.  Fit the open end over the tip
of the sausage stuffer and slide it to about 1 inch from the wide end. Push
the rest of the casing onto the stuffer until the top touches the knot.

(The casing will look like accordian folds on the stuffer.)

Fit the stuffer onto the meat grinder as directed on the instructions that
come with the machine, or hold the wide end of the stuffer against or over
the opeoning by hand. Fill the hopper with stuffing. Turn the machine on if
it is electric  and feed the stuffing gradually into the hopper; for a
manual machine, push the stuffing through with a wooden pestle. The sausage
casing will fill and inflate gradually. Stop filling about 1 1/4 inches
from the funnel end and slip the casing off the funnel, smoothing out any
bumps carefully with your fingers and being careful not to push the
stuffing out of the casing. Tie off the open end of the sausage tightly
with a piece of string or make a knot in the casing itself. Repeat until
all the stuffing is used up.

To cook, slice the andouille 1/2 inch thick and grill in a hot skillet with
no water for about 12 minutes on each side, until brown and crisp at the
edges.

Apples & Buttons (Schnitz Un Knepp)

ham, penn dutch

3 pound ham
1 quart apple, dried
2 tablespoon brown sugar
2 cup flour
1 single milk
4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 each egg, well beaten
3 tablespoon butter, melted
1 teaspoon salt

*** My notes: I think the recipes in this cookbook all assume using a
whole, uncooked ham. I would omit the step of boiling ham for 3 hours
if using a cooked ham. Pick over and wash dried apples. Cover with
water and let soak over night or for a number of hours. In the
morning, cover ham with cold water and let boil for 3 hours. Add the
apples and water in which they have been soaked and continue to boil
for another hour. Add brown sugar. Make dumplings by sifting together
the flour, salt, pepper and baking powder. Stir in the beaten egg,
milk (enough to make fairly moist, stiff batter), and melted butter.
Drop the batter by spoonfuls into the hot liquid with the ham and
apples. Cover kettle tight and cook dumplings for 15 minutes. Serve
piping hot on large platter. Source: Pennsylvania Dutch Cook Book -

Australian Pork With Port & Coffee Sauce

main dish, pork, sauces

4 3/8 pound pork loin, boned
1 cup strong coffee
1/2 cup cream
1/3 cup port
2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 cup water
2 teaspoon cornstarch

Preheat oven to 350F. Remove rind from pork and trim fat to make a 1
cm layer. Roll and tie the meat. Weight pork and calculate cooking
time, allow 25-30 mins. per 500 gr. Place meat in roasting pan. Roast
pork for 30 mins.

Combine coffee, 1/4 c. cream, 1/4 c port and sugar, pour over pork.
Continue roasting pork for calculated cooking time, basting pork
every 15 mins with coffee mixture. This basting gives the outside a
beautiful golden glaze and helps to keep the meat moist.

Remove pork from oven when cooked. Keep covered in a warm place while
making the sauce.

Skim fat from the pan juices. Place juices in a small saucepan with
water, remaining 1/4 c cream, remaining port and cornstarch. Cook
until thickened, strain.

Slice pork thinly and place a tablespoon or two of sauce on each
serving. Remaining sauce should be available for guests to add more.

Babi Ketjap (Soy Pork)

pork, indonesian

500  pork
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1  salt
1  onion
2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon sambal oelek (hot pepper condiment)
5 tablespoon sweet soy sauce (ketjap manis)
150  water
1 margarine or oil

There are quite a few pork dishes in the book (including another
version of this one).  Evidently minorities are well enough
represented that pork has earned a place in the cuisine of
predominantly Muslim Indonesia. I think this would be excellent done
with 1 inch long pieces of baby back ribs. I also won't stew it as
long as I did++or maybe use bigger chunks of pork. I used pieces
between a half and a quarter inch on a side and the meat got a tad
dried out.  No complaint on the taste though! I'll also toss in a
couple of scallions cut into one inch chunks just before it's done
stewing. I was out of sambal oelek so I used some tuong ot toi cut
with a little lime juice. Worked good.

Dice Pork, rub in salt and pepper and fry in hot oil or margarine.
Then add the finely sliced onions, spices and the hot pepper
condiment.

After this add the water and the soy sauce.  Bring to the boil and
simmer for at least half an hour until the meat is done.

Serve Babi Ketjap on a large plate, garnish with sliced tomatoes and
chopped vegetable pickles.  Eat with plain or savory rice or Mei.

From "Indonesian Food and Cookery", Sri Owen, Prospect Books, London,
1986."

For those who aren't familiar with it, Kecap Manis (or ketjap manis)
is a thick, sweet Indonesian soy sauce that does wonderful things for
meat and poultry as a marinade/barbecue sauce as well as a condiment.

Baked Ham

main dish, meats

4 pound country ham
1  onion, peeled and quartered
1  carrot, quartered
1  stalk of celery
1 pound bouquet garni (see below)
6  peppercorns
      ----FOR BAKING----
1/4 cup dark brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground mace
1  orange rind and juice
1 1/2 cup cider
1  watercress (for garnish)
      ----BOUQUET GARNI----
3  parsley sprigs
1  thyme sprig
1  bay leaf

METHOD: Allow 1/2 to 1 pound. of ham per person, depending on the amount of
bone included.  If the ham is heavily cured (like Virginia ham) immerse it
for 4 hours in cold water and then drain.  If lightly cured, cook it
without soaking.  Put the ham in a large saucepan with the vegetables,
water to cover, bouquet garni and peppercorns.  Cover and simmer gently 1
1/4 hours for a 2 pound. cut or 30 minutes per pound for cuts over 3
pounds. (20
minutes per pound is enough for large hams over 10 pounds.).

When the ham is cooked, drain it and peel away the skin.  This is easily
done by carefully lifting corner of skim with a knife and pulling with the
fingers.  If the ham is very hot, hold skin with a cloth or paper towel.
Set ham in a baking pan, fat side upwards.

Combine sugar, mace orange rind and juice to form a paste; spread over ham
and pour cider around it.  Bake in a moderately hot oven (375øF) for 30
minutes or until golden, basing often.

WATCHPOINT: Wait until the sugar begins to brown on the ham before basting
with cider.  You need to keep the ham moist.  But it's not too difficult to
baste the lean part of ham and avoid sugared crust.

Finish the top as follows:  if using an electric stove, caramelize the
sugar crust by placing under a hot broiler for 5 to 7 minutes until crisp
and brown.  If using a gas stove, heat two metal skewers in the flame until
red hot.  Take each skewer in turn and hold lightly on the sugar crust to
burn decorative lines.

Arrange ham on a platter and if serving hot, let stand in a warm place 15
minutes before serving to make caring easier.  If serving cold, allow ham
to become completely cold before carving.  Garnish with watercress and
serve with raisin or Cumberland sauce.

NOTE:  Bouquet garni (a bunch of herbs) -- is traditionally made of
parsley, thyme and bay leaf (tied together with string if used in liquids
which are to be strained).  Otherwise herbs should be tied in a piece of
cheesecloth for easy removal before serving the dish.  If you have no fresh
thyme use 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme.

Baked Pork Chops & Corn

pork

1 free flow recipe

Here's an old time idea that's probably "Mid-Western" enough for ya.
This is something I picked up from my ex-Mennonite Grandmother in
Hutchinson, Kasas.  Take four nice thick pork chops and brown 'em on
each side. Dice up four or so slices of stale bread++or bread dried
out in the oven. Mix that into a can or so of creamed corn. How many
cans you need will vary with the brand of corn.  Add about half a
chopped up yellow onion and a couple of beaten eggs.  Mix the mess
well and add salt an pepper to taste. Put the browned chops in a
greased baking dish, pour the corn mixture over the chops and pop 'em
in a 325F oven for about an hour. The corn topping should come out
browned and fairly dry and the chops should be nice and succulent
with a hint of sweetness from the corn. This is one dish that garlic
will absolutely ruin!  I've tried all sorts of ways to fancy up this
dish but have never been successful in improving the original simple
recipe. And there's not ONE squid tentacle in the whole mess! Posted

Baked Sandwiches

sandwich, low cal

1 1/4 cup water at 110 to 115 f
2 1/4 teaspoon quick-rise yeast (1 pkg)
2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1  egg
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 cup graham flour
1  filling
1 1/2 pound lean ground beef
1/2 cup chopped onions
1 cup tomato sauce
1/4 cup catsup
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon leaf oregano
1 pinch pepper

May be frozen.  Defrost in the fridge, on the way to a picnic or in
the microwave if you want them in a hurry.

Combine water and yeast in mixer bowl and let stand 5 minutes.  Add
all purpose flour and mix at medium speed for another 4 minutes.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead a few
times, form into a ball and place in a well-greased mixing bowl.
Turn the ball over to grease the top, cover with a cloth and let
stand at room temperature to rise until doubled in volume.

While the dough is rising, cook the meat and onions over medium heat,
stirring frequently, until the onions are soft and the meat is
browned. Drain.  Discard fat and juice, return meat and onions to the
pan.  Add tomato sauce, catsup, seasoning and cook over medium heat
until the meat is dry with no noticeable liquid.  Set meat mixture
aside to cool until dough is ready.

After the dough has doubled in volume, transfer it to a lightly
floured working surface.  Knead lightly.  Form into a roll and cut
into 12 equal portions.  Form each portion into a little ball, cover
with a cloth and let rest for 10 minutes.

Roll each ball out to form a circle 5 to 6 inches across.  Put about
1/4 cup of the meat mixture in the center of the circle.  Pull the
dough up around the filling and press together at the top.  Place on
a well greased cookie sheet, cover with a cloth and let stand about
30 to 40 minutes at room temperature or until doubled in volume.
Bake at 350 F for 40 to 45 minutes or until lightly browned and firm.
Serve hot, using 1 sandwich per serving, or refrigerate or freeze to
be used later.

for 5 minutes. Add stock and tomato paste; bring to boil, deglazing
pan. Return pork to skillet; stir in red peppers, prosciutto, garlic,
paprika, thyme and hot pepper flakes.

Bavarian Pork

pork, ham

4 boneless pork sirloin chops
2 to 3 garlic cloves -- minced
2 tablespoon cooking oil -- divided
1/2 cup seasoned flour
1/2 pound mushrooms -- sliced
1 bunch scallion -- sliced
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1 can beer -- room temperature
1 tablespoon to 2t sour cream -- optional

In 1 tablespoon of oil, saute garlic; then lightly flour pork and
brown until golden. Remove pork and set aside. In same skillet, add
another tablespoon of oil; saute scallions and mushrooms. Return pork
to pan; sprinkle with thyme.  Add 8-12 ounce beer, depending on
thickness of cut; bring to boil (the alcohol evaporates and leaves a
"malt" flavor, so thedarker the brand, the better). Cover and simmer
8 minutes for thin, 15-20 minutes for thick. Spoon sauce over meat to
serve. For a richer sauce, add 1-2 tablespoons sour creamjust before
serving. From Ann Conway

Bbq Boston Butt

pork, ham, crockpot, bbq

4 pound boston pork butt
1 bottle barbecue saucee

Cook Boston pork butt all day, or until it is so tender it falls apart
easily.  Romove from pot and let it cool slightly, but do not let it
get cold.  Pull meat away from fat (remove fat and discard) and shred
meat with two forks.  Return meat to crockpot and add a bottle of
your favorite barbecue sauce (I like KC Masterpiece, or Kraft Honey
Barbeque sauce) and stir until thoroughly combined. Continue cooking
until heated through. This makes great sandwiches on buns, or meat
entree. Great with coleslaw and baked beans.

onion and sautee until transparent. Addpotato bite size pieces and
pepper. Add chicken stock mix and stir until well mixed. Bring
mixture to a boil. In small pan, melt second margarine measure and
add flour to create a roux. It should be light brown in color. When
stock comes to a boil, add roux with a wire whisk. This will cause
the soup to start thickening. Return to a boil. Slowly add the milk.
If the soup is too thin, make additional roux and add it to the soup.
If you need to do this, be sure to cook the roux until a tan color.
This will get rid of the raw flour taste. If the soup is too thick,
thin it out with more milk.

you know beans about chili, you know chili ain't got no beans! This
recipe is a lot of work, but well worth it! Oregano Tea (bring 2 c
water to boil; add 2 tablespoon dried oregano leaves. Brew like tea; stain,
reserving liquid) Remove the stems, seeds, and veins from peppers;
add to boiling water 30 minutes. Use a knife and strip meat off
peppers, discard skins; put into food processor with enough beer to
make the consistency of tomato sauce. Divide the bacon, garlic,
onions, sausage and beef into thirds. We are going to fry up the
mixture 1/3 a time. Fry up the bacon (mostly for grease) until just
about crisp. Add garlic, and after 30 seconds, add onions, hot sauce
to taste, salt and pepper. When the onions are translucent, add the
sausage. When about half cooked, add beef. When the mixture is about
medium, drain the grease and refry until well done (this sears the
meat and keeps the flavor in). When done, put into pot. Repeat for
next 1/3 and last 1/3. Stir in the pepper paste (from above), broth,
and tomato sauce. Take your time--over low heat. Then add the
remaining ingredients, one at a time, slowly. Add enough beer to keep
the consistency to your liking. Now adjust the spices like a real
expert! Cook over low heat 2+ hours, and you'll have one fine bowl of
red! Enjoy! Mike FROM: MIKE CROUCH (NNBB09A)

Birria

meats, mexican, pork, ham, spices
lamb

      ----ONE DAY AHEAD----
2 lamb shanks
1 veal breast
1 lamb breast
3 pound loin of pork, rib or shoulder end
2 tablespoon salt
6 chiles anchos
3 chiles guajillos
10 chiles cascabel
1 hot water to cover
18  peppercorns
4 whole cloves
1/4 teaspoon oregano
1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds, scant ts
1/4 cup vinegar
2 teaspoon salt
6 centiliter garlic, peeled
1/2 small onion
      ----ON SERVING DAY----
1 1/2 cup water
1 the meat
1 flour and water paste
2 pound tomatoes, broiled (see recipe)
1 meat juice
1 cup onion, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon oregano

The word birria means something deformed or grotesque, and it is used
col- loquially in the northwest to mean a mess or failure. This
certainly looks a mess when it is cooked, but it is a very savory one.

It is a really rustic dish.  Usually a whole goat or lamb, although
in some places just the offal, is seasoned with a paste of ground
spices and chilies and cooked in a pit barbecue.

One day ahead: There will be approximately 6 to 7 pounds of meat.
Slash the meats in several places down to the bone and rub the salt
well into it. Meanwhile, prepare the chili paste. Heat the comal (or
griddle) and toast the chilies lightly, turning them from time to
time so that they will not burn.  Remove the veins and seeds. Put the
chilies to soak in hot water for abt. 20 minutes, then transfer with
a slotted spoon to the blender jar, add the rest of the ingredients,
and blend to a smooth sauce. Cover the meat thickly with the paste
and set it aside to season for about 18 hours.

On serving day: Preheat the oven to 350F. Put the water in the bottom
of a large Dutch over or casserole with a tightly fitting lid and
place the meat on a rack so the it is just about the water. Seal the
lid with a paste of flour and water and cook for about 3 1/2 to 4
hours, by which time the meat should be almot falling off the bones.

Strain off the juices from the bottom of the pan, cool, and skim off
the fat.  There should be about 2 cups of juices left-if not, make it
up with up to 2 cups of water. Blend the tomatoes to a smooth sauce.
Put the sauce and the skimmed juices from the meat into a saucepan
and bring to a boil.

Serve each portion of mixed meats in a deep bowl. pour 1/2 cup of
sauce over the meat and sprinkle with the chopped onion and oregano.
Eat with tortillas. Makes 8 to 10 servings.

BLACK BEAN CHILI #15

chili, pork, ham, beef, beans
tex mex

3 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 large onions; chopped
2 green peppers; chopped
4 cloves garlic; minced
1 pound beef stew meat; cut into 1-inch cubes
2 pound boneless pork butt
1  28 -ounce can whole tomatoes; reserve liquid
1/4 to 1/3 cup chili powder
1 to 2 jalapeno chili peppers; chopped (remove seeds)
2 tablespoon ground cumin
1 dash cayenne pepper
1  ; salt (optional)
1 freshly ground black pepper
2 cup black beans; cooked
1/2 cup dry red wine
1 Cheddar cheese; grated
1 fresh cilantro; chopped
1 red onions; chopped
1 sour cream

Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add 2 onions, bell
peppers, and garlic and saute until tender, about 14 minutes. Transfer
mixture to a bowl using a slotted spoon. Add beef and pork to pan and
cook over medium-high heat until meat is no longer pink, stirring
occasionally, approximately 8 minutes or so. Return onion mixture to
pan. Now add tomatoes with the reserved liquid, chili powder, chili
peppers, cumin, and cayenne pepper.  Season with salt (optional) and
pepper. Cover the pan and simmer until beef and pork are just about
tender (stir the pan every once in a while), about 1 hour.

Add black beans and the wine to chili.  Simmer uncovered until meat is
tender and the chili begins to thicken. This will probably take about
25 minutes. When chili is finished, ladle into bowls. Serve with
cheese, cilantro, red onions and sour cream in separate little bowls.

Judi's notes:  I usually add about 1/4 cup water or beef broth once or
twice during the cooking process if it appears too dry.

1 1/4 quart fresh pig's blood
8 7/8 ounce bread cut into cubes
1 1/4 quart skim milk
1 pound cooked barley
1 pound fresh beef suet
8 ounce fine oatmeal
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoon dried and crumbled mint

Put the bread cubes to soak in the milk in a warm oven. Do not heat
the milk beyond blood temperature! Have the blood ready in a large
bowl, and pour the warm milk and bread into it. Stir in the cooked
barley. Grate the beef suet into the mixture and stir it up with the
oatmeal. Season with the salt, pepper and mint.

Have ready 2 or three large roasting pans.  Divide the mixture
between them ~- they should not be more than 3/4 full. Bake in a
moderate oven -- 350 F ~- for about an hour or until the pudding is
well cooked through. This makes a beautifully light pudding which
will keep well in a cold larder.

Cut into squared and fry till heated through and the outside is
crisp, in bacon fat or butter.  Delicious for breakfast, or for

Blue Cheese Stuffed Pork Chops *g

cheese/eggs, pork, ham

1/2 cup carrot; shredded
1/4 cup pecans; chopped
1/4 cup cheese, blue; crumbled
1 each onions, green; sliced
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
4 each pork loin chops
1/4 cup yogurt, plain
4 teaspoon flour, all-purpose
3/4 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon instant chicken bouillon
1 dash pepper

In a small bowl, combine carrot, pecans, blue cheese, green onion and
Worcestershire sauce for stuffing. Trim fat from meat. Make a pocket
in each chop by cutting horizontally into the chop from the fat side
almost to the bone.  Spoon about 1/4 of the stuffing into each
pocket. Fasten with wooden toothpicks if needed. Grill until brown
and cooked through. In a small sauce pan, mix yogurt and flour.  Add
milk, chicken bouillon, and pepper.  Cook and stir until thickening
and bubbly. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more. To serve, remove the
toothpicks, and serve sauce over chops.

Original Posters Notes: From the Better Homes and Gardens "Grill It
Right" cookbook.  Got the book at Sam's about 4 months ago. Very good
book. I fixed this because my wife LOVES blue cheese, any form, on or
in anything <g>.  I am so-so on it, but this is a very good recipe,
and well worth the trouble to make the pockets and stuffing. Picky 13
year old (It's not a big mac) even ate it <g>.

Boudin Sausage

pork, ham

2 pound lean pork or veal
2  onions, chopped
1/2 bunch chopped green onions
2 cup cloves, minced
1/2 bunch chopped parsley
1/2 teaspoon thyme
2 bay leaves
1 tablespoon salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon ground white pepper, or to
1  taste
1 teaspoon cayenne, or to taste
2 cup water
3 cup cooked rice
4 teaspoon twenty-inch long cleaned
1 sausage casings.
1  pepper

Contributed to the echo by: Fred Towner Originally from: "The 100
Greatest Dishes of Louisiana", by Roy F. Guste, Jr. BOUDIN: Mince the
pork or veal and put it in a pot with the chopped onions, green
onions, garlic, parsley, thyme, bay leaves, salt, pepper(s), and
cayenne. Add just enough water to meet the level of the ingredients.
Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Put the ingredients into a
bowl and stir in the cooked rice. Adjust seasonings if necessary. Tie
the 4 sausage casings at one end and stuff them with the mixture.
Twist each 20-inch length into three equal lengths. Tie open end.

The boudin can be cooked covered in a little water, grilled or pan
fried in a little butter. Cut the sausages and serve 2 to each person.

Serves 6

VARIATIONS:

This dish is a good one to learn because once you have mastered its
preparation you can use almost anything in the place of the pork or
veal. Some of the most popular are chicken, shrimp, crabmeat, and
crayfish.

Bread is a traditional but not as good replacement for the rice.

NOTE: This is a great dish to make and it freezes well. Many people
cut the casing off the boudin before eating it.

Braised & Deep Fried Pork Slices In Wine Sauc

pork, ham, chinese

1 teaspoon red rice vinegar
2 tablespoon medium sherry
3/4 cup stock
1 cornstarch paste
1 1/2 pound boned pork butt
3 tablespoon peanut oil
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 egg yolks
1 teaspoon water
1 cup fine plain bread crumbs
4 cup oil for deep-frying
1  paste:
2 tablespoon cooked rice
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon dry baker's yeast
2 tablespoon dark soy sauce
2 tablespoon warm water
1 teaspoon wet bean cheese (opt)

The flavoring of the pork with our version of Fujinese "wine lees
paste" gives it a distinctive and uniquely delicious flavor.

Prepare Paste:  Use mortar and pestle to pulverize cooked rice.
Combine with sugar, yeast, soy and warm water. Let stand in warm
place for 30 minutes to activate yeast. Authentic wine lees paste is
not available in the U.S. to our knowledge, this is the best substi-
tute we have found. You can add wet bean cheese for a sharper flavor.

Braise Pork:  Slice pork butt across the grain into strips, 1" by 3"
by 1/2" thick.  Heat peanut oil in wok until it begins to smoke. Add
some of pork to hot oil; stir-fry pieces until they lose their pink-
ness; repeat in batches until all pork is browned.  Next, add garlic
to wok; stir briefly. Pour in wine lees paste, rice vinegar, sherry
and stock; bring to slow boil; add pork slices. Reduce heat, cover,
and simmer for 30 minutes.

Remove pork, without sauce, to large platter.  Cool pork. Cooling is
essential so that it will deep-fry properly. Reserve sauce in small
pan. You can hold pork for several hours, if you wish to braise it in
advance.

Deep-fry Pork:  Heat deep-frying oil in wok.  While oil is heating,
beat egg yolks with water; set out bread crumbs on platter. Dip pork
pieces in egg mixture, then bread crumbs, to thoroughly cover.

When oil is at deep-frying temperature, 375 degrees, slip in a slice
of pork as a test:  pork should lightly brown in about 1 minute.
Place 6 pork slices on Chinese strainer, and lower into oil, strainer
and all. Check in 2 minutes (browning should take slightly longer
than test because strainer cools the oil).  If you prefer to fry in
larger batches, use more oil. Remove fried pork to warm platter,
uncovered.

Finish:  Reheat sauce, and pour over pork just before serving.

Braised Pork Chops With Sour Cream Sauce

pork, sauces, ham, french

2 pound 4 center-cut loin chops
1 tablespoon corn oil
1/4 cup carrots, chopped
1/4 cup celery, chopped
1/2 cup onions, chopped
1 tablespoon garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon thyme
1 bay leaf
3 sprigs of fresh parsley
1/4 cup dry white wine
3/4 cup chicken broth
2 tablespoon tomato paste
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup capers, drained

1. Heat the oil in a large skillet large enough to hold the chops in
one layer. Add the chops and cook until golden brown on both sides,
about 5 min. 2. Scatter the carrots, celery, onion, garlic, thyme,
bayleaf and parsley around the chops. Cover and cook 10 min. 3. Blend
the wine, chicken broth and tomato paste and add to the skillet.
Cover closely and cook about 25 min. longer, turning the chops once.
4. Remove the chops and keep hot. Add the mustard and sour cream to
the skillet and stir. Bring just to a boil, but do not boil or the
sour cream will curdle. Put the sauce through a fine sieve, pressing
down with a wooden spoon to extract the liquid flavorings from the
vegetables. 5. Pour the sauce into a saucepan and add the capers.
Reheat gently without boiling. 6. Spoon the sauce over the chops.

This is great when you have guest over.

Carmelized Pork

main dish, pork, vietnamese

1 pound fresh pork leg (ham)
1 tablespoon cooking oil
1 teaspoon salt
2 each green onions
1 dash pepper
1 tablespoon fish sauce

Cut the fresh ham into several chunks about 1 1/2 to 2 inches square.
Chop the green onion fine.  Heat the oil in 2 quart pot, then add the
onion and the remaining ingredients, including the pork. Saute,
stirring, on medium heat until the meat is brown (about 5 minutes or
more). Add 4 cups water and simmer, uncovered, on medium heat for one
hour. Add the fish sauce and continue to simmer on medium heat 1 more
hour. Most of the water will be absorbed by the meat and the
remainder will be slightly thick--or carmelized.  Be careful not to
burn it. Serve hot as a main dish, with lots of rice.  This has a
very long life--it may be frozen, refrigerated, reheated, and served
as an appetizer, etc. Note: This takes a long time to cook, but is
very easy to do. In Hue, central Vietnam, pork belly is used in this
recipe. Bellyis very fat and is considered good in a cooler climate.
Don't discard the fat portions before tasting--it is surprisingly
good and surprisingly digestible. Recipe from: Vietnamese Cookery, by

Carne Adobado ( Chile-Marinaded Pork )

pork

1 cup chile caribe
4 cup water

3  cloves garlic
2 tablespoon ground mexican oregano
2 tablespoon ground comino -- ( cumin )
5 pound pork loin chops -- thinly
1  sliced

Combine the Chile Caribe and water in  a blender ans whirl intul
mixed into a sauce. It will become somewhat thick, similar to ketchup
in consistancy. Add salt, garlic, oregano and comino to the sauce and
mix well. Trim the excess fat from the pork and lay slices flat in a
large baking dish. Cover with the sauce; turn the meat once to coat
evenly on both sides. Allow to marinate in the refrigerator
overnight. You can either cook this in the oven covered with aluminum
foil at 325 degrees for 30 minutes then uncover and bake another 30
minutes or grill over a fire with mesquite CHUNKS ( chips just burn
up, chunks give a much better flavor ) that have been soaked for
several hours in water. I prefer the grilling method. I also add a
touch of oil to the marinade and baste my pork loin with it when
grilling.  This makes great fajitas or just serve the meat as an
entree with rice and good beans.

Carne De Cerdo - Lentils With Pork & Banana

pork

1  stephen ceideburg
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 kg boneless pork, cubed
2 large onions, chopped
2  cloves garlic, minced
3 large tomatoes, diced
100 ml boiling water
1  salt and pepper to taste
1 1/2 cup brown lentils
4 cup water
4 large firm bananas
3 tablespoon chopped fresh coriander

Many years ago, restaurant dining meant fruit with every- thing. Now
fruit is desperately passe. But it's a mistake to throw out the
authentic with the spurious. This surprising but satisfying
combination of ingredients originates in South America.

In a large saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and brown on all
sides 1 kg cubed boneless pork. Add 2 large onions, chopped, and 2
cloves of garlic, minced, and brown them. Add 3 large tomatoes,
diced, 100 mL boiling water and salt and pepper to taste. Cover and
cook very slowly for about 1 1/2 hour. Meanwhile simmer 1 1/2 cups
brown lentils in 4 cups water for 45 minutes; do not drain.

Add the undrained lentils to the pork mixture, combine well, cover
and cook over a low heat for a further 30 minutes, until both the
pork and the lentils are tender.

Taste for seasoning. Add 4 large firm bananas cut into 2 cm pieces
and 3 tablespoons or more of chopped, fresh coriander. Cook 10
minutes longer. Serve with a little more coriander scat- tered on
top. (You can use the coriander stems as well as the leaves, provided
they are well washed. Finely chopped they add interesting crunch.)

Carne De Puerco Con Chile Verde

mexican, pork

3 pound boneless pork roast
48 ounce tomatillos, drained and crushed
16 ounce green chiles; chopped (ortega mild gree
5  garlic cloves; crushed
1 large onion, chopped
3/4 cup ; water
1  salt
1  pepper

optional -- your favorite fresh green chiles, chopped or sliced.
Cilantro if you like it.

Slice up the pork and trim away most of the fat.  Dice both the lean
meat and the fat into 1/2-inch cubes; set the diced fat aside.

In a heavy pot over a hot flame, cook the lean pork with the water,
stirring until the water is gone and the meat begins to brown. Add
onion and garlic, and stir constantly until the onion becomes
transparent.

Reduce heat to a simmer and add tomatillos and canned chilis (be *sure*
to drain the tomatillos before crushing; the water they are packed in
is too salty).

Cover the pot and simmer slowly for about an hour, stirring
occasionally to prevent sticking.

Meanwhile, render the diced pork fat into cracklings by sauteeing in a
skillet over medium heat until the pieces are brown and crispy. Drain
and salt the cracklings and set aside; save the lard for any other
dish where you want some high-quality cholesterol stuff.

After an hour the chile verde should be pretty juicy but not watery.
Add a little water if it's too dry. Add salt and pepper to taste, and
if you want it hotter, add your fresh chiles now. Cover and simmer
again for at least half an hour.  The longer the better.

To serve, sprinkle with chopped cilantro (if used) and the cracklings.
Serve with Spanish rice, tortillas, black beans, and ice-cold beer.
Serves 6 or 8.

surface of each of the pieces. Before filling, wait for egg mixture
to take effect, softening the wrappers; this takes about 2 minutes.
When you become adept at this, you can work on several wrappers at a
time. When the wrapper looks soft and transparent, place about 1 teaspoon.
of filling near the curved side, in the shape of a rectangle. Fold
the sides over to enclose the filling and continue to roll. After

Cha Shu (Barbecued Pork Strips)

2 tablespoon chicken stock
2 tablespoon dark soy sauce
1 tablespoon soybean condiment
1  (mein see*)
1  lrg. clove garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon chinese rice wine or dry sherry
1 1/2 tablespoon honey
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon hoisin sauce
1  few drops of red food coloring

Cut the pork into long strips 1 1/2 to 2 inches square. Mix all for
the marinade and marinate the meat for 3 hrs., unrefrigerated, or 6
hrs. in the refrigerator.  Turn the strips every hour or so.

Preheat the oven to 350^.  Place a large cake pan half filled with
water on the lowest shelf of your oven. This will catch drips from
the meat and prevent smoking. Place the meat strips directly on an
oven rack and put in the top position of the oven. Be sure that all
of the meat is over the dripping pan. Roast for 45 minutes without
disturbing the meat. Then, turn the heat up to 450^ and roast for an
additional 15 minutes or until the pork strips are crisp and a rich
brown color. Slice the meat and serve it hot or cold... or use in
other dishes as directed.

*Mein See:  The remains of the process of making soy sauce. Very rich
soybean condiment used in many Chinese dishes. Can be found in
Oriental markets under this name or soybean jam or condiment.

10 mins). Place in a greased bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place
until doubled in bulk (about 1 hour 15 mins). Meanwhile, prepare pork
filling; let cool and set aside. Turn dough out onto a lightly
floured board and knead for 1 min. Shape into a rectangle. With a
floured knife, cut rectangle in half lengthwise, then cut crosswise 6
times to make 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a round about 4
1/2" in diameter. Press outside edges of dough to make them slightly
thinner that the rest of the round. Place about 2 tablespoon of filling in
center of each round. Pull edges of dough up around filling and twist
to seal. Place each bun, sealed side down, on a 3" square of foil.
Cover and let rise in a warm place until puffy and light (about 30
mins). Set in steamer over boiling water. Cover and steam for 12 to
15 mins. (when done, tops of buns should be glazed and smooth). Serve
warm.

Pork Filling: Cut 1 1/2 pounds boneless lean pork into 1/2" cubes.
Season with 2 cloves garlic (minced), 1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger, 2
teaspoon sugar and 2 tablespoon Chinese soy sauce. In a bowl, combine 2
teaspoon
sugar, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, 2 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon dry
sherry and 1/4
cup water; reserve. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wok or wide frying pan over
high heat. When oil is hot, add pork and stirfry until browned (about
5 mins). Add 1 medium size chopped onion and continue to stir frying
until onion is limp (about 2 mins). Stir cornstarch mixture, add to
pork and cook, stirring, until sauce bubbly and thickens. Cool.

Cha Siu Bow (Steamed Barbecued Pork Buns)

pork, ham, chinese

      ----FILLING----
4 cup barbecued pork; dice fine
1/2 cup dehydrated onion flakes
      ----SAUCE MIXTURE----
2 teaspoon hoisin sauce
2 teaspoon sherry
4 teaspoon oyster sauce
2 teaspoon catsup
1 teaspoon sugar
1 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
1 1/2 cup chicken stock

*Recipe is included in this collection. TO MAKE FILLING: Soak onion
flakes in a cup with just enough water to cover flakes. Mix sauce in
a small sauce pan.
Cook over medium high heat until sauce thickens. Stir in the diced
pork and onion flakes. Chill 3-4 hours.
WRAPPING: Divide filling into 24 portions. Divide dough into 24
balls. Slightly flatten each ball then roll out into 4-inch discs,
leaving the center of the disc twice as thick as the side. Place 1
portion of the filling in the center of the dough. Gather up the
sides around the filling and twist dough to seal.
Place on a 2 inch square piece of wax paper, twist side down. Put the
wrapped buns at least 2 inches apart on a cookie sheet and allow the
buns to rise in a draft-free place (the oven) for another hour.
STEAMING: Steam for 15 minutes. Turn heat off and let the steam
subside before lifting the cover. BAKING: Cha Siu Bow can also be
baked. Preheat oven at 350 degrees. Set buns 2 inches apart on cookie
sheet.
Brush with a mixture of 1 beaten egg white, 1 teaspoon.
water and 1/4 teaspoon. sugar. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden
brown. Brush with melted butter. DO AHEAD NOTES: Cook and freeze.
Reheat by steaming if steam-cooked originally. Steam frozen buns for
1/2 hour to reheat. If baked, thaw and wrap buns in foil or cover pan
with foil and reheat in slow oven for 1/2 hour.

COMMENTS: A good filling should have some pork fat mixed in with the
lean meat. Most importantly, Cha Siu Bow filling should be very
juicy. That's why Ms. Yee uses so much liquid in the sauce mixture.
By chilling the filling thoroughly, the sauce, which is very thick,
adheres to the filling much better. Ideally, when you make the
barbecued pork, you should try to save the pork drippings and use
them as part of the sauce mixture. Ms. Yee deliberately leaves the
center of the dough a bit thick because, if you roll it out to an
even thickness, the top of the bun will ended up being too thin in
comparison to the bottom due to of the way the dough is wrapped. In a
pinch, you may use frozen bread dough as a substitute. However,
frozen dough works best when baked. It does not steam well.

2 tablespoon sugar
3/4 cup water
1 tablespoon peanut or corn oil
1 cup finely chopped onion
3 cup cantonese barbecue pork, in 1/2-inc; h dice (about 1-lb.)
1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon; water
1 teaspoon sesame oil
2  egg yolks
2 tablespoon water
1 teaspoon sugar
1  chinese baked sweet bread dough (re; cipe follows)
1 pkg active dry yeast (1 tablespoon)
3 tablespoon sugar
1 cup warm milk (100 to 110)
1  egg
3/4 cup vegetable oil
3 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, + more for dusti; ng and kneading

Reheat in a 350 degree F. oven for 5 minutes, or microwave at high
about 1 minute.

Prepare bread dough. Cut out twenty 3-inch squares of parchment
paper. Mix together ginger, oyster sauce, hoisin, dark soy, sugar and
water in a bowl.

Heat a wok over medium-high heat. Add oil. When hot, add onion;
stir-fry until soft. Don't brown. Add pork and stir-fry 30 seconds.
Pour in sauce mixture, bring to a boil. Stir cornstarch/water into a
smooth mixture. Add to pork; cook, stirring until thick, about 15
seconds. Add sesame oil. Remove to bowl; refrigerate until thoroughly
chilled.

Cut dough in half. Form each half into a 12-inch long log; cut into 10
pieces. Roll each piece into a 4-inch circle. Roll outer inch of each
circle 1/8-inch thin; leave middle slightly thicker.

If right-handed, place a dough circle in palm of your left hand. Put
a big tablespoon of pork mixture in the ; middle; put left thumb over
the pork. With your right hand, bring up edge and make a pleat in it.
Rotate circle a little and make a second pleat. As you make each
pleat, gently pull it up and around as if to enclose your thumb.
Continue rotating, pleating and pinching, then gently twist into a
spiral. Pinch to seal. Place bun pleated side down on a parchment
square. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Put buns 1 1/2
inches apart on a baking sheet. Let rise until doubled in size, 30
minutes to 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Beat egg yolks with water and sugar;
brush over buns. Bake 20 minutes.

Makes 20 buns.

CHINESE BAKED SWEET BREAD DOUGH

Chinese bread dough is quite sweet compared with Western breads (the
further south you go in China, the sweeter the dough becomes). Most
Chinese breads are steamed, which is why they look pale and uncooked
to the Western eye.

Put the yeast and 1 tablespoon of the sugar in a small bowl. Add 1/4
cup of the warm milk. Let stand 5 minutes, then stir to dissolve. If
should foam and bubble. If it does not, discard and use a fresh
package of yeast. Stir in the egg, oil and remaining milk.

Put the flour and remaining sugar in the work bowl of a food processor
fitted with the metal blade. Process 2 seconds. With the machine
running, pour the warm milk mixture down the feed tube in a steady
stream. Process until it forms a rough ball. If ball is sticky and
wet, add a little more flour. Process a few seconds longer, or until
dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Remove dough to a
lightly floured board.

Knead dough, dusting with flour to keep it from sticking, until
smooth and elastic, about 2 minutes. Place in a large oiled bowl,
cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm spot until doubled,
about 1 hour.

Punch down dough and place on a lightly floured surface. It is now
ready to form into rolls, buns or loaves.

Makes enough for 20 barbecued pork buns. Joyce Jue, San Francisco

Chao Tom (Barbecued Shrimp Paste On Sugar Can

pork, ham, venison, condiments

1 tablespoon roasted rice powder
1  scallion oil
1  crisp-fried shallots
1 tablespoon roasted peanuts, ground
1 pound raw shrimp in the shell
1 tablespoon salt
6  garlic cloves, crushed
6  shallots, crushed
2  ounces rock sugar, crushed to a pow; der, or
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
4  ounces pork fat
4 teaspoon nuoc mam
1  freshly ground black pepper
1  peanut sauce
1  vegetable platter
8  ounces 6 1/2-inch rice paper rounds; (banh trang)
12  piece fresh sugar cane, or
12 ounce sugar cane packed in light syrup, d; rained
12  8-1/2 ea inch bamboo skewers soaked; in water for 30 minutes
1  vegetable oil, for shaping shrimp p; aste
8  ounces extra-thin rice vermicelli

The allied recipes for this rather complex operation follow in the
next post. Although this dish can be baked in an oven, I strongly
suggest you grill it over charcoal, for the result is far superior.
The dish may be prepared over 2 consecutive days.  On day one,
prepare the dipping sauce and condiments.  The Vegetable Platter and
shrimp paste can be assembled the following day. Fresh sugar cane may
be obtained at Caribbean markets; canned sugar cane is available at
Asian grocery stores. Prepare the roasted rice powder, scallion oil,
crisp-fried shallots and roasted peanuts. Set aside. Shell and devein
the shrimp. Sprinkle the salt over the shrimp and let stand for 20
minutes. Rinse the shrimp thoroughly with cold water. Drain and
squeeze between your hands to remove excess water. Dry thoroughly
with paper towels.  Coarsely chop the shrimp. Boil the pork fat for
10 minutes. Drain and finely dice. In a food processor, combine the
shrimp, garlic, shallots and sugar. Process until the shrimp paste
pulls away from the sides of the container, stopping as necessary to
scrape down the sides. The paste should be very fine and sticky. Add
the pork fat, roasted rice powder, fish sauce and black pepper to
taste to the processor. Pulse briefly, only enough to blend all of
the ingredients. Cover and refrigerate. Meanwhile, prepare the Peanut
Sauce and Vegetable Platter. Cover the rice papers with a damp towel
and a sheet of plastic wrap; keep at room temperature until needed.
Peel the fresh sugar cane; cut crosswise into 4-inch sections. Split
each section lengthwise into quarters. (if using canned sugar cane,
split each section lengthwise in half only, then thread 2 pieces
lengthwise onto a skewer.) Pour about 1/4 cup of oil into a small
bowl. Oil your fingers. Pick up and mold about 2 tablespoons of the
shrimp paste around and halfway down a piece of fresh sugar cane.
Leave about 1 1/2 inches of the sugar cane exposed to serve as a
handle. (If using canned sugar cane, there is no need to leave a
handle. The skewers will serve as handles.) Press firmly so that the
paste adheres to the cane. Proceed until you have used all the shrimp
paste. Prepare a charcoal grill or preheat the oven to broil.
Meanwhile, steam the noodles, then garnish with the scallion oil,
crisp-fried shallots and ground roasted peanuts. Keep warm.  Pour the
peanut sauce into individual bowls and place the Vegetable Platter
and rice papers on the table. Grill the shrimp paste on the sugar
cane over medium coals, turning frequently. Or Broil, on a baking
sheet lined with foil, under the broiler, about 6 inches from the
heat, for 3 minutes on each side, or until browned. Transfer to a
warm platter. To serve, each diner dips a rice paper round in a bowl
of warm water to make it pliable, then places the paper on a dinner
plate. Different ingredients from the Vegetable Platter, some noodles
and a piece of the shrimp paste, which has been removed from the
sugar cane, are added. The rice paper is then roiled up to form a
neat package. The roll is dipped in the Peanut Sauce and eaten out of
hand. The remaining sugar cane may be chewed. Note: If both types of
sugar cane are unavailable, use skewers. Shape the shrimp paste into
meatballs and thread 3 or 4 on each skewer. Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

Char Shu (Roast Pork)

pork

1 cup water
6 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon salt
1/2 cup dark soy sauce
1/4 cup rice wine
1 centiliter garlic
3 slice ginger root
3 pound pork -- butt, shoulder,
1  tenderloin

PREPARATION:

Heat water and add sugar and salt, stirring until melted. Remove from
stove.  Add soy sauce and rice wine. Smash, peel, and mince garlic,
and add to the soy sauce mixture. Peel and mince ginger root and add.
Mix well. Place meat in a bowl and pour the mixture over it. If meat
is not completely covered, you will need to turn it frequently as it
marinates. Allow it to stand in the refrigerator for 48 hours. (You
can cheat and make the marinating time shorter -- never shorter than
6 hours -- but the longer the time, the more the meat will tenderize
and absorb the fine flavor.) Pour off marinade, but do not wipe meat.
Place the meat on a rack in a baking pan.

COOKING:

Heat oven to 450-degrees.  Bake the meat for 10 minutes. Reduce heat
to 250-degrees and bake for 30 minutes. Turn meat over and bake for
another 30 minutes.

Cheesy Bacon & Egg Slice

pork, cheese

1/2  white bread; unsliced
125 gm Cheddar cheese; grated
5  bacon
3  shallots
1 small green pepper
6  eggs
2 cup milk
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1  mayonnaise
1  pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1 small red pepper

Recipe by: ALHS_BURMEIS@wmich.edu (ALHS_BURMEIS) Trim crusts from
bread, cut bread into 2.5 cm (1") cubes, place bread in single layer
in ovenproff dish. Sprinkle with cheese. Cut bacon in 2.5 cm pieces,
fry until crisp and brown, drain, place over cheese, top with chopped
shallots and chopped green pepper.

Whisk eggs with fork, add milk, mustard, Worcestershire sauce,
mayonnaise, pepper and basil. Pour over bread mixture, top with
chopped red pepper, cover with plastic food wrap, refrigerate
overnight. Next day, bake uncovered in moderate oven (350 degrees)
for 50 to 60 minutes.

Serves 6.

This dish looks pretty, layered with the colors.  The first time I
made thi it was good, but it stuck to the pan. The next time I
greased my pan, and did not stick. I also used a 9"x9" pan. It works,
but it is very full and bakes quite tall.  Since they did not specify
size of pan, you could probab use a larger pan. The picture looked
like an oval white pfalzcraft cassero dish.

This is one of the tastiest and handiest recipes we have created in
the kitchen.  The whole dish is prepared, covered, refrigerated
overnight and baked when you are ready the next day. It can be baked
on the same day, but the flavor is not quite as good.

Chicken & Vegetable Soup With Tiny Meatball

soups, vegetables, pork, chicken

3 quart chicken stock
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
2 medium onions, diced
2  ribs celery, diced
1 medium carrot, scrubbed and diced
2 tablespoon tomato paste
1 tablespoon brandy
1 large turnip, peeled and diced
1/4 large butternut squash, peeled, seeded an; d diced
1  thick slice crusty French or otalia; n bread
3 small cloves garlic
1  egg
12 ounce boned and skin cooked chicken, coar; sely diced
4 ounce best quality smoked ham, coarsely d; iced
1  freshly ground black pepper
1  small sprigs fresh basil and/or par; sley
1  unbleached all-purpose flour
1  salt to taste

Bring the stock to a boil in a large soup pot.  Turn the heat down to
low and let simmer, uncovered, while you continue.

Heat the oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onions
and saute for 2 or 3 minutes.  Add the celery and carrot; saute for
another 5 minutes, then add the vegetables to the simmering chicken
stock along with the tomato paste, brandy, turnip and butternut
squash. Simmer gently, covered, until the vegetables are tender,
about 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, make the meatballs.  In a food processor whizz together the
bread, garlic and egg for about 30 seconds until a smooth paste is
formed. Add the chicken, ham, pepper and the basil and/or parsley.
Pulse-chop 10 to 15 times, then process until a smooth, very thick
paste is formed.

Roll the meat paste into balls the size of a large marble. Roll the
balls in the flour so that they are lightly dusted all over.

When the vegetables are tender, raise the heat slightly so that the
soup simmers with a little more intensity. Drop the meatballs into
the soup and let cook for 5 to 7 minutes. Taste for seasoning and
adjust if necessary. Be careful not to oversalt as the ham is salty.
Serve immediately.

Serves 6 to 8 as an entre with bread and salad.

NOTE:  This is even better the next day, but first remove the
meatballs and wrap them separately rather than storing them overnight
with the broth.

Chili ( Kathy Pitts' New Mexico )

chili, pork, pitts

1  text recipe

I don't have a real recipe for New Mexico-style chile, although I do
make it occasionally when I manage to drag home more fresh Anaheim or
Poblano chiles than I can dispose of otherwise.  (Kroger's sometimes
has BIG bags of them for 99 cents a bag ;-)

What I do is first roast the chiles (either in the broiler or --
better -- over charcoal).  The number of chiles I use depends on the
size/heat of the chiles, and can range from 2-3 to 10 or more.  If
the chiles are really hot (it happens sometimes, even with Anaheims),
I'll also add 3-4 roasted green bell peppers to give the dish the
required pepper taste without rendering it inedible by anyone without
an asbestos esophagus.

After the chiles have cooled a bit, I peel and seed them, and cut
them into coarse dice.  I sometimes (not always) will also roast/peel
5-6 tomatoes to place in the chiles, but tomatoes are optional in
this dish, and I usually don't use 'em.

Next, cut up 3-4 pounds of lean boneless pork (beef is sometimes
used, but isn't as good in this dish, IMHO, and I would imagine lamb
would be very good here indeed).

Coat the meat in seasoned flour, and brown it in hot lard.  Remove
from the pan and set aside.  Toss a couple of chopped onions into the
pot, along with a clove or two of garlic.  When the onions are
golden, I add enough flour to make a roux, and cook until the roux is
light brown.

I then add chicken broth to make a fairly thin gravy, the pork,
chiles, tomatoes (if used), and season the dish with cumin and
Mexican oregano.

Simmer for a couple of hours, until the pork is tender and the
flavors have blended.  The end dish should have a pronounced green
chile/pepper flavor and be the consistancy of a thick stew.  It's
very good by itself, or as a filling for burritos/soft tacos, and is
wonderful reheated the next morning and served as a side dish with
scrambled eggs for breakfast. Wes, for some bizarre reason, likes it
over rice...

Sorry for the inexact recipe/directions.  I learned to make this dish
from an ex-neighbor who was or mixed Hispanic/Native American
ancestry, and never QUITE got around to rendering her directions into
a real recipe. (She served the dish with fry bread, and a pot of
white beans on the side -- have no idea whether this was traditional
or simply the way she liked it.)

3 centiliter garlic, minced
2 pound pork tenderloin

Mix chili, de-seeded*, salt,and cumin in small bowl. Stir in oil and

cutting lengthwise and 2/3 of the way through, leaving meat in one
piece; spread meat flat.  Cut tenderloin crosswise into 6 equal
pieces. Place port betwen pieces of plastic wrap and pound with meat
mallet to 1/4 in. thickness. Spread chili paste on both sides of pork
pieces to coat evenly. Place in shallow glass baking dish. Marinate,
covered in fridge or 3 hours. Prepare grill. Grill pork for 8-10
mins. turning once. *Toast dried peppers before mixing paste.  Heat
ungreased heavy skillet over medium. heat, place chilies in the skillet
in a single layer. Cook for 2 minutes the color changes slightly,
press down with a spatula and turn occasionally. When chilies cool
enough to handle, cut each one open and pull out the seeds and
ribbing.  You could skip the toasting of the chilies, but remove the
seeds.I always add more chilies because I like it really hot. Posted

1/4 teaspoon 5 spice powder
2 tablespoon sugar
3 tablespoon soysauce
1 tablespoon wine (kao-liang)
1/2 tablespoon sesame oil

*(butt or loin)

Procedure:

1. Trim the meat into a round piede-1 1/2 inch diameter. Cut the
first slice almost through.  Cut the secon slice completely through.
Continue until you have 20 double pieces. (The shape should be like a
hamburger bun, that is one piece should not be cut completely
through). Cut the pork fat into 20 round pieces a little smaller than
the lean pork.

2. Place pork and fat into a bowl.  Add the crushed scallion and
ginger, five spice powder, sugar, soysauce, wine, sesame oil, and
pepper. Stir until the ingredients are well mixed. Soak about one
hour.

3. Put one slice of fat into each double slice of the lean pork. Put
the pieces on a skewer.  Don't put them too close together. Put the
skewer on a baking sheet and place in the oven. Roast the coin shape
pork for 30 minutes at 350 degrees F. (after cooking for 15 minutes
remove and rub some of the marinade sauce on the pork and then return
to the oven). Remove the pork from oven and remove from the skewer.
Rub some oil on top.
Arrange on a platter in overlapping layers.

NOTE:  1.  Serve with Steamed Flower Shaped Rolls, which are in
Pei-Mei's Cook Book Volume I page 233. 2.
The skewer should be as long as a chopstick.

Chinese Bbq Pork

pork, chinese

2 pound boneless pork shoulder, cut into 8x; 2-1/2x1/2 pieces
      ----MARINADE----
5 teaspoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
2  garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon ginger juice
4 tablespoon ketchup
4 tablespoon soy sauce
5 teaspoon white wine
1 teaspoon five spice powder
      ----BASTING SAUCE----
1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
1/4 cup honey

Marinate pork for 2-4 hours, or overnight if you wish. Preheat oven
to 375F and place marinated pork on a rack over a roasting pan filled
with 1 cup of water. Bake for 20 minutes, basting occasionally with
remaining marinade. Turn and bake another 20 minutes.

Take pan out of oven, swich oven to broil.  Baste both sides of pork
with basting sauce and broil for 1 minute on each side.

Let pork cool and cut into thin slices.  Serve hot or cold. Keep in
tightly sealed container in refrigerator or in freezer if not served
right away. Reheat with a little water in roasting pan, or wrap in
foil.

Notes:  Let the meat marinade at least 8 hours - you will get a much
more tender result.  Make extra, it's really good... We serve it cold
on a plate with pickled ginger and green onion flowers as a starter
to a Chinese meal. Or add it to 'La Choy' frozen wonton soup along
with some green onion, and slivered vegetables for a 'homemade' look.

NOTE: these buns are cooked in bamboo steamers which are available in
Chinese and specialty gourmet cookware stores. The round steamers can
be pruchased in various sizes separately or in sets of two of three
tiers. For cooking, the covered steamer(s) is (are) placed over
boiling water in a wok or large saucepan. The above is quoted
directly from a section connected to the recipe.  This is my own
note. I do not like the flavor that a bamboo steamer imparts to
recipes; therefore, I bought an aluminum Chinese steamer.
1. Combine hoi sin sauce, oyster sauce, soy sauce and sesame oil.
Chop pork and onions finely.
2. Heat vegetable oil in wok or fry pan over high heat. Stir-fry
ginger and garlic in the oil 1 minute. Stir in hoi sin mixture. Cook

Blend into hoi sin mixture.  Cook and stir until liquid boils. Reduce
heat to medium and simmer 2 minutes. Stir in pork and onions. Remove
from heat. Cool completely.
3. Combine flour, baking powder and salt in large bowl. Cut or rub in
shortenilng until mixture resembles bread crumbs. Combine remaining
3/4 cup of the water and the vinegar. Mix water-vinegar into flour
until dough sticks together.  Shape dough into ball. Knead on lightly
floured surface 6 or 8 times. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand
20 minutes.
Uncover and knead 4 or 5 more times.  Divide dough into 12 equal
portions.
Shape each portions into a smooth ball.
4. Roll each ball of dough on lightly floured surface into a circle
5 to 6 inches in diameter.  Brush around edges lightly with water.
Spoon a heaping tablespoon of pork mixture onto center of each
circle. Carefully pinch edges together to seal dough around filling.
Bring the two ends of dough over the seam and pinch together.
5. Cut waxed paper into twelve 5-inch squares.  Brush one side of
paper lightly with oil.  Place a bun, seam side down, on each square.
6.Place buns with paper in single layer on steamer rack over boiling
water.  Cover and steam buns until done about 20 minutes. Yield: 1
dozen BARBECUED PORK: 1. Remove and discard fat from meat.
2. Combine soy sauce, wine, sugar, honey, food coloring, cinnamon,
garlic and onion in large bowl. Add pork, turning tenderloins to coat
completely. Cover and let stand at room temperature 1 hour or
refrigerate overnight, turning occasionaly.
3. Drain pork, reserve marinade.  Place pork on wire rack over
baking pan.
4. Bake in preheated 350 degree F. oven until done, about 45 minutes.

stir fry them. if you really need to move them, PUSH them tenderly by
the flat side of the spoon. 6. add water to boil to 10 min. (close
the lid on and simmer, and I prefer a longer time to 20 minutes if I
am not in a hurry) 7. now you can smell how good it is to cook with
soybean sauce and sugar in chinese food, after the tofu cubes absorb
the sauces and are done, spread over the mixture of cornstarch and
cold water and heat up to boil again until the sauce becomes a little
bit thick, 8. sprinkle the chopped green onion and ready to serve. be
careful to PUSH or scoop the tofu to the serving plate, you dont want
to smash the tofu cubes and let the savory sauces come out of them.:>

Combine the pork, mushrooms, prawns, and onion.  Put mixture on
chopping board and chop 10 to 15 strokes with cleaver. (Use a sharp
knife if you don't have a cleaver.) Texture, when you're finished,
should be slightly finer than hamburger.

Add "seasoning" and the egg to the pork mixture.  Mix well.

To make dumpling, place 1 Tb filling in the center of a dumpling
skin. Then bring all sides of the skin up to cover the meat as much
as possible, without closing. The top of the dumpling is left open.

with the rest, cool, wrap, freeze. Reheat after thawing by steaming
10 minutes.

Serve with soy sauce, hot sauce, or mustard.

*  Dumpling skins are similar to won ton skins, except that they are
round and slightly thinner.  You may substitute won ton skins by
merely cutting off the corners to round off the skin.

Chorizo (Mexican Sausage)

meats, mexican, pork

20  sausage casings (pork casings for a; uthentic links)
1  vinegar
2 pound lean pork trimmings
8 ounce beef or pork fat
2 medium onions, quartered
8  cloves garlic, pressed
1/2 cup cider vinegar
1/4 cup tequila (optional)
1/4 cup ground red chile, mild or hot
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 1/2 teaspoon ground comino
1 teaspoon ground mexican oregano
1 tablespoon salt

..I [=Jane Butel] have generally made bulk sausage, as it is much
easier. Sausage has to be taken out of the casing for most uses
anyway.

1.  Clean the casings, rinse well with water, then pour vinegar
through them.  Set aside.

2.  Use a food processor or the coarse blade of a meat grinder, grind
the meat and fat.  Add the onions, garlic, vinegar, tequila and
seasonings, using the hotness of chile powder your family and guests
will prefer.

3.  Stuff the casings.  First cut the casings into 3-ft lengths and
tie one end together.  Use either a funnel or filling tube to fill
the lengths. Tie at about 4-inch intervals with heavy thread.

4.  Place on a cookie sheet covered with wax paper. Set on the
counter for about 2 hours, then refrigerate.

5.  After a day, freeze what you will not use within a week or two.
Mixture should ripen for at least 8 hours before using.

Notes:  If you have no food processor or grinder, buy triple ground
pork. Prepare the recipe once and taste for the mildness or hotness
of the ground red chile. Adjust to suit your taste for the next time
you make sausage.

Freezing hints: Mold the sausage into 1/2-pound lumps and freeze
between pieces of foil inside a heavy plastic bag.

Maximum recommended freezer storage:  3 months.

Makes 20 sausages or  2 2/3 pounds bulk sausage.

Chorizos (Mexican Sausage)

meats, mexican, pork

2 pound pork tenderloin (ground ok)
5  chiles anchos
1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds (toasted)
1/2 teaspoon peppercorns
1/8 teaspoon cumin seeds
2 tablespoon sweet paprika
2/3 cup mild white vinegar
1/2 pound pork fat
2  chilies pasilla
3  cloves
1/2 teaspoon oregano (mexican blended)
4  garlic cloves (peel/crush)
2 1/2 teaspoon salt
2 fl ounce vodka (if wanted)

Chop the meat roughly, (or purchase ground pork), together with the fat.

Toast the chilies well, turning them from time to time so they do not burn.
While they are still warm and flexible, slit them open and remove the seeds
and veins.  As they cool off they will become crisp.

Grind the spices together withe the chilies.

Mix the ground spices and chilies with the rest of the ingredients and rub
them well into the meat with your hands.

Cover the mixture and set it aside in the refrigerator to season for 3
days, stirring it well each day. (Before using, fry a little of the meat
and taste to see if it has enough salt and seasoning.)

Normally the meat would be put into sausage casings, however, I just use it
straight from the bowl.  If you don't want to stuff the meat into casings
at all, leave it to mature for about a week.  Store it in containers in the
freezer compartment of the refrigerator.

cold water and squeeze dry.  Drain bacon and pat dry. Chop bacon. Mix
into sauerkraut and add crushed juniper berries and gin. Add half of
sauerkraut mixture to crockpot, then add mixed meats and remaining
sauerkraut, sprinkling with pepper as you go. Pour wine over all and
cover. Cook about 2 hours on High.

Turn into warmed serving bowl.  Sprinkle with parsley. Serve with
boiled potatoes.  Pass around mustard  or horseradish, if you wish.

Sylvia's comments: cook on HIGH?  In a crockpot?  Then what's the
point? I cooked it all day on LOW and everything was falling apart. I
have a similar recipe that includes apples and brown sugar that I
like better; this is great for someone who favors bitter tastes, I
served it with applesauce which cut the bitterness well and the
result was delicious.

Cider Braised Pork Loin

fruits, main dish, meats, pork

2 teaspoon dried sage
1/2 teaspoon to 1 ts black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 pound pork loin roast, boneless
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 medium onions, thinly sliced or
1  chopped
4  garlic cloves, crushed
1 large apple, peeled and diced
1 large bay leaf
2 cup unsweetened apple juice or
1  cider
1/2 cup dry white wine

In a small bowl, combine sage, pepper and salt.  Rub over whole surface of
pork.  Place in an ungreased 9 x 13 inch dish.  Preheat oven to 325F.

Pour oil into a medium-size frying pan, Set over medium heat.  When hot,
add onions and garlic and saute, stirring frequently, until they just begin
to brown, about 5 minutes.  Add remaining ingredients and bring to a boil.
Pour mixture around pork.

Roast, uncovered, in the centre of preheated oven for 2 hours, turning meat
every 30 minutes.  Remove meat to a platter and cover with foil to keep
warm.  Pour juice into a small saucepan.  Skim off and discard any fat.
Place over medium high heat.  Boil gently,

uncovered and mashing some of the apple with a fork, until reduced about 8
to 10 minutes.  The sauce is excellent as it is, or if you prefer a
smoother texture, puree in a blender or food processor. Serve in a sauce
dish  for pouring over thick slices of pork.  Serves 8 - 12. Goes well with
a fruity white wine or cold apple cider. Consider serving it with
buttermilk mashed potatoes and maple glazed carrots.

Classic Barbecued Spareribs

appetizers, pork, chinese

2 pound spareribs, in one piece
1  (have the butcher trim the
1  fat and discard the
1  breastbone)
4 cup plum sauce
      ----MARINADE----
4 tablespoon chicken broth
1/4 cup soy sauce
3 tablespoon honey or corn syrup
3 tablespoon hoisin sauce
2 tablespoon wine vinegar
2 tablespoon dry sherry or
1  shaoshing wine
1 teaspoon sugar
2 centiliter (medium) garlic,
1  chopped fine
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 pinch (tiny) 5-spice powder
1  (optional)
      ----DIPPING SAUCE----
1  plum sauce
1  scallion, chopped

Preheat the oven 10 375 degree F. Trim any excess fat from the ribs
and place them in a long shallow dish. In a mixing bowl, combine the
marinade ingredients; if you are using 5-spice powder, add it to the
mixture by putting it through a tea strainer so it spreads out over
the mixture. Mix well, and pour over the ribs and leave for 3 hours
at room temperature or about 6 hours in the refrigerator. Baste the
ribs every hours or so, turning them over. TO ROAST THE RIBS: Remove
the ribs from the marinade. Add the 1/4 cup plum sauce to the
marinade; reserve it for basting. Hook metal drapery hooks through
both ends of each rack of ribs, at the top, and hang each one as if
you were hanging a hammock, suspended from the bars of one of the
oven racks. Set the oven rack in the highest position in the oven. On
the floor of the oven or on another oven rack set at the lowest
position in the oven, place a baking pan half filled with water, to
collect drippings and prevent smoking. You may want to line the
baking pan with aluminum foil before putting the water in, to make it
easier to clean. Roast the spareribs for 45 minutes in the preheated
oven. Then baste them with the reserved basting sauce, using a small
pastery brush and carefully pulling out the oven rack to facilitate
the basting process. Turn the oven up to 450 degrees F and roast for
another 15 minutes. By this time the spareribs should be a rich
golden brown with crisp edges. Baste again, then take them out of the
oven. Place the ribs on a cutting board and remove the drapery hooks.
Separate the individual ribs with a cleaver or sharp knife. Serve at
room temperature, with dipping sauce. Makes 6 to 8 appetizer
servings. NOTE: You will need about 12 drapery hooks. Recipe:

Coca Cola Basted Ham

beverages, main dish, meats, pork

10 pound ham *
6 cup coca-cola
1 cup brown sugar, dark, packed
1 tablespoon dry mustard
2 tablespoon sharp prepared mustard
2 cup bread crumbs, fine, dry

* Ham should be one of the precooked hams.  Not one of the specialty cured
or canned hams.  Just the standard bone in ham in the meat counter.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees (165 degrees C).

Place ham fat side down in a shallow pan. Pour cola into pan 1/2 inch deep.
Bake 2 to 3 hours, or until ham can easily be pierced with a fork, basting
with cola every 15 minutes. Center of ham will read 140 degrees F (60
degrees C) on a meat thermometer. Remove ham from pan and cool.

Increase oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Cut away the rind with a sharp knife. Combine sugar, mustard, bread crumbs
and enough cola to form a thick paste. Spread paste over entire ham. Place
ham on roasting rack in oven and bake 45 minutes longer, basting every 10
minutes, until mustard paste has melted into a dark glaze. Let stand at
room temperature 30 minutes before slicing.

Cockentrice (A Marvelous Beast)

pork, chicken, medieval

1  suckling pig, about 7 pounds
1 large roasting chicken, about 6 pounds
6  egg yolks
1/4 teaspoon powdered saffron
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup white wine
1 tablespoon fresh parsley leaves, very finely c; hopped
1 tablespoon flour

"The extraordinary "beasts" created by these instructions never were
seen on land or sea.  A bestiary pair, these chicken and pork visual
as well as edible delights were intended to startle as well as feed.
The creation of such illusion foods was an important contribution of
the medieval cook to the flamboyant art forms of the medieval feast."

Bake the chicken and the suckling pig separately at 375 F until
tender; the chicken ought to take 2 hours, the suckling pig closer to
3 hours.

Cut the chicken in half with the incision running around the body
behind the wings.  The forward half is thus separated from the
hindparts. Similarly cleave the pig so that the "head and shoulders"
are cut from the back half of the animal.  With a strong butcher's
thread or "carpet" thread sew the forward half of the chicken to the
back half of the pig; sew the pig's "head and shoulders" to the hind
half of the capon. Each is now a cockentrice.  Turn oven up to 400F.

Lightly beat the egg yolks.  Mix in the saffron and flour to make a
thick fluid.  Paint this on the suture lines as well as various parts
of either the "face" or appendages--gold snout and gold nails were
typical adornments.

Return these marvelous animals to the oven so the gold "endoring" may
set and the final creatures appear resplendent.

Mix the parsley in white wine with flour until the green color well
permeates the fluid.  If not a bright green, add two drops of green
food coloring.  Paint on "feathers" or designs for final embellishing
of the cockentrice, your fancy guiding your hand.

1/2 teaspoon fresh minced ginger (about 2 quarte; r-sized slices)
1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon hot pepper oil, or to taste
1 teaspoon asian sesame oil
1 1/2 teaspoon sugar
2 teaspoon rice vinegar
2 tablespoon minced fresh coriander or green oni; on

Joyce Jue comes through again!  You owe it to yourself to try this
method of cooking if you like pork, Chinese food or both.  It's an
absurdly simple way to produce delicious foods.  If you don't like
pork, fix this using a chicken.

Fresh ham or a fairly fat cut of pork is traditionally used for this
recipe, but boneless lean pork loin makes a delicious and leaner
substitute.  For a nontraditional presentation, serve the pork with
grilled asparagus spears, Asian eggplant and/or zucchini slices.  Or,
arrange the slices on a bed of watercress with strips of roasted
pepper and serve as a first course salad.  Or, simply alternate the
pork with thin rounds of chilled cucumber.

Bring the water to a boil in a large pot, then add the pork, green
onions, ginger, garlic and wine.  Bring to a boil again.  Skim off
the scum that rises to surface.  Cover, reduce heat low and simmer
for 45 minutes.

When the meat is done, half fill a large pan with cold water and ice
cubes. Remove the meat from the pot and immediately plunge it into
the ice water; let sit for 20 minutes to firm up the meat and juices.
Remove pork, pat dry, cover and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled,
at least 2 to 3 hours, or overnight.

GARLIC SESAME SAUCE:  Mix together all ingredients.

To serve:  Cut the meat crosswise into paper-thin slices (no thicker
than 1/8 inch) and arrange in a circular pattern on a plate.  Serve
sauce on the side or drizzle it over the pork.  Garnish with fresh
coriander leaves.

Serves 8 to 10.

Country Ham And Pork Sausage

main dish, makemeat

1 x no ingredients

2 pound.     pork butt 1/2-3/4 pound. leftover boiled or baked country ham
or 3/4
pound. raw country ham 1/2 pound. fat trimmed from ham 1/2 pound. fresh
pork back
fat 2 ounce. skin from ham (optional) 1 teaspoon. freshly ground black
pepper 1/4
teaspoon.    ground cloves 1/2 teaspoon. ground sage (optional) 1 teaspoon.
red pepper
flakes 1/2 teaspoon. ground ginger 1 teaspoon. sugar 3/4-1 Cup water Medium
hog
casings

Grind the pork butt through a 3/8-inch plate, the ham, ham fat, pork fat,
and skin through a 1/8-inch plate. If you are starting out with raw country
ham, simmer a 3/4 pound. piece for about 2 hours, and then cool before
grinding. The ham stock can be used for pea or bean soup. Taste to make
sure it's not too salty, though. Mix together thoroughly the ground meats,
fat, and skin with the spices, sugar, and water. Stuff into medium hog
casings and tie into 5-inch links. Refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze
for 2 months. Use fried as a patty or poached in links as a less salty but
very tasty addition to any dish that calls for ham as a seasoning.

Be sure not to add salt to this recipe because country ham is usually quite
salty and should season the mixture very nicely just by itself. Start with
1/2 pound.  of ham, then fry and taste a small patty of the sausage. You
can
add more ham if you want a saltier and more intense ham flavor.

Country Hams: Virginia, Smithfield, Kentucky, Etc.

meats

1  ham
1 quart cider
1/4 cup brown sugar
1  black pepper
1  corn meal
1  brown sugar

It is the custom in some parts of the U.S. to hang hams, after special
processing, for several years, after which time, of course, they develop a
heavy exterior mold.

To prepare one of these old hams, soak it in cold water to cover for 24 to
36 hours.  Then scrub it well, using a brush and yellow soap, if necessary,
to remove the mold.  Rinse thoroughly and place in a kettle of simmering
water, skin side down.  Allow 20 minutes to the pound until the meat
reaches an internal heat of 150ø.  Add to the water before last 1/4 of
cooking time:  cider and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.

Drain when the cooking time has elapsed.  Remove the skin while the ham is
still warm, being careful not to tear the fat.  Trim the fat partially.
Dust the ham with a mixture of black pepper, corn meal, and brown sugar.

Put in a 425ø oven long enough to glaze it.  If you want more of a baked
quality allow the ham to reach an internal heat of 160ø to 165ø. Serve hot
or cold.  Be sure to slice very, very thin.

Country Pate

appetizers, meats, pork

1 1/2 pound boneless pork, ground fine twice
1 pound boneless veal, ground fine twice
3/4 cup dry white wine
2 tablespoon brandy
2 tablespoon oil
1  salt
1  freshly ground black pepper
2 large onions, sliced thin
2 small cloves garlic, halved
1 pound fresh pork fatback, sliced thin
1  cornichon pickle for garnish

Servings: Makes about 3 pounds From: Sallie Krebs

DIRECTIONS: In a large bowl, combine the pork and veal. Mix the wine,
brandy and oil with salt and pepper to taste, and pour the mixture
over the meats. Scatter the onions and garlic on top. Cover the bowl
tightly and refrigerate it for at least 24 hours.

Preheat the oven to 375-F. Discard the onions, but put the garlic
through a press and knead it into the meats together with the wine
mixture. Break off a small piece of meat and fry it in a lightly
oiled skillet over moderate heat for 3 or 4 minutes, or until its
juices run clear, without a trace of pink. Taste the piece and, if
you like, add more garlic, salt and pepper. (Pork is unsafe to eat
uncooked; do not taste the meats raw.)

Slightly overlapping the slices, line the bottom and sides of a
2-quart terrine mold or a 7 1/2 x 3 1/2 x 2 1/2 inch loaf pan with
the fatback. Pack the meat mixture into the mold, and arrange the
remaining slices of fatback on top of it. Fit foil over the mold, or
cover the meat mixture with foil and a lid. To let steam escape,
pierce a hole in the foil with a skewer. If you are using a lid,
insert the skewer through its hole to puncture the foil.

Set the mold on a rack in a large pan or dish. Place them all in the
oven, and pour enough almost-boiling water into the pan to cover 2/3
of the mold. Bake for 2 hours or until the pate shrinks slightly from
the sides of the mold and the surrounding fat and juices are a clear
yellowish white with no traces of pink. Or insert a meat thermometer;
it should register 160-F when the pate is done.

Take the pate from the oven, but leave the foil in place. Set the
pate on a rack to cool to room temperature. Then put another pan with
a heavy can or weights inside it, or even a brick, on top of the pate
to compact the meats. Chill the pate thoroughly (overnight is best)
with the weights in place. Before serving, cut the cornichon into a
fan shape, slicing lengthwise through the pickle 4 or 5 times to
within 1/2 inch of one end. Spread the slices into a fan, and garnish
the pate with it.

Crisp Roasted Pig's Head

pork, chinese

1  pig's head, cleaned and tongue remo; ved
1 teaspoon 5-spice powder
2 tablespoon salt
1/2 cup mien see (ground brown bean sauce); or 1/2 cup oyster sauce
1/4 cup bourbon
1 cup honey, combined with
1 cup boiling water

Remove any hair on head by singeing over and open flame or plucking.
Scrub well (using a vegetable brush, if desired) and then sprinkle
with salt, rubbing it into the skin.  Rinse well with cool water; pat
dry. Remove any excess fat.

Place head in a colander in the sink and pour a kettle full of boiling
water over.  Let cool.

Combine the 5-spice powder, salt, bean sauce and bourbon. Slash the
meat on underside of head and rub half of the spice mixture into the
meat. Rub the remaining spice mixture onto the skin.  Place head
upright on a rack in a large baking pan.  Bake at 375F for 1 1/2
hours. Lower heat to 325F and continue cooking for an additional 2
hours, or until the meat is cooked through, basting the skin well
every 30 minutes with the honey-water mixture.  (Cooking time will
depend on the size of the head.) If ears begin to brown too quickly
during cooking period, wrap them with foil.

When head is done, remove to platter and garnish with watercress or
coriander.  Chop head into pieces and serve with sweet vegetable
relish or plum sauce.

[I'd definitely serve with spiced salt and Chinese mustard and minced
green onions for dipping too.]

Crockpot Chili Verde

pork, crockpot, new mexican

1  onion; coarsely chopped
1  bell pepper, green; coarsely chopped
4  garlic clove; minced
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 ounce green chile, canned diced
1  jalape#o; diced (opt)
7  tomatillo
2 pound pork, lean; trimmed & cubed
2 teaspoon oregano
2 teaspoon sage
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 cup beer

First, saute one onion and one green pepper, coarsely chopped, with
three or four cloves of garlic, minced, in olive oil.  Throw into the
crockpot. Also throw in a small can of diced green chiles.  Depending
on your propensity for spicy food, you may add from one to three
jalapenos, sliced. Then, throw some tomatillos in the pot.  How many?
Well, when I got fresh ones in San Diego, I'd get seven or eight.
Peel off the husk and coarsely chop.  Now that I've moved to
Pittsburgh (don't ask me why), I've had to use canned ones on
occasion. How many? Well, I don't really remember, it was one medium
sized can, I think. Pay attention: I mean tomatillos, not green
tomatoes. The Frugal Gourmet substituted celery and tomatoes. I
haven't forgiven him yet.

Take about 2 pounds of lean pork (I trim off all the excess fat I
can), cubed, and brown in the pan that you sauteed the onion, etc.
in. Into the pot.  Now, the seasoning mixture.  I prefer to grind up
in my mortar oregano, some dried red chile peppers, sage, and cumin
seed. Perhaps also some black pepper.  I almost never put salt in
anything, so I probably wouldn't here either, but you may want to.
How much? Well, about 2 teaspoon each of the oregano and the sage.  1
teaspoon
each of the cumin seed and dried red peppers.  Salt and pepper to
taste. I probably will add a dash of beer (about 1/2 cup) for obscure
reasons.

This crockpots all day, or could be simmered for probably about 2
hours.

Traditionally, this is served in bowls, with hot flour tortillas,
salsa, and cilantro.  You can also have sour cream, grated cheese,
olives, and pickled carrots and jalapenos around.  Of course, you
wrap all this up in the tortillas, making killer burritos.

I throw one twist into this, a technique that comes from carnitas.
After cooking, I separate the meat from the broth, crisp the meat
under the broiler, and reduce the sauce in the pan.  This adds a
great texture to the meat, and keeps the burritos from being too
soggy. This is not what the original requester would want to do.

Now: Potatoes (around the roast)-- say, 4 servings. I know, you are
two people but *I* eat like two people all by myself! If you really
feel you both eat like birds-- halve everything for 2-3 servings.

Diresctions:  Wash and peel the potatoes (you can just scrub them if
you wish); cut potatoes lengthwise-- 8 wedges. Figure you add them 1
1/4 -2 hrs before the roast is done; overlap potaoes as little as
possible and dot with butter/margarine. sprinkle with the herbs and
the onion and celery salts. Add a little ground peppper if you like.
Check potatoes and remove when tender and be sure to turn and baste
them with those great pan drippings once or twice while cooking!

2 large onions-fine chop
6 large tomatoes-chop
6 ounce tomatoe paste
2 cup water
2 each garlic cloves-crush
2 teaspoon salt

:       Flour the pork and brown it in the drippings in a skillet.
Remove pork to a large stew pot, 3 to 5 quart size. Add onions to
drippings in the skillet and cook until the onion is translucent.
:       Add the onions to the pork.  Cut the chiles into 1 inch
slices; add to the meat and onions in the pot.
:       Add the remaining ingredients and cook over medium heat for
about 1 hour, until the stew is slightly thickened.
:       If you prefer the all day method, follow the same directions
except put the ingredients in a crock pot. Cook on low for 10-12
hoursor high for 5 hours.

plenty of flour tortillas handy, you will not want to miss one tasty
drop.

Dan's Spicy Smoked Spareribs

8 pound pork spareribs, cut into
1  4-rib sections
      ----DRY INGREDIENTS----
1 tablespoon powdered ginger
1 tablespoon powdered mustard
1 tablespoon paprika
1/2 tablespoon salt
1/2 tablespoon chinese five-spice powder
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon powdered sage
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
      ----BASTING SAUCE----
1/2 teaspoon tomato juice
1 cup peach preserves
2 tablespoon commercial barbecue sauce
2 tablespoon melted butter or margarine
1 tablespoon wine vinegar
1 tablespoon finely minced onion
1 tablespoon finely minced bell pepper
1  (red or green)
1  juice of one and one-half
1  limes
1  two or three dashes of
1  Tabasco sauce

Contributed to the echo by: Dan Perez Dan's Spicy Smoked Spareribs To
get started, place a handful of hickory or mesquite chips into cold
water and set aside. Parboil rib sections in boiling water for about
ten minutes. (This partially cooks them and renders much of the fat.)
Remove rib sections and set on wire rack to cool. Combine dry
ingredients in a bowl and blend well with a fork. When rib sections
are cool, rub the dry ingredient mixture into the meat. Stack rib
sections, seal in aluminum foil and let them sit in the refrigerator
for about two hours.

After two hours, start the coals in your smoker. Combine ingredients
for basting sauce in a blender and blend until smooth. Transfer the
basting sauce to a saucepan and heat over low heat until it begins to
bubble. If you prefer for the basting sauce to be thicker, mix 2
tablespoons of cornstarch with 1/4 cup of cold water, and mix a
little of the cornstarch mixture into the basting sauce a bit at a
time to until desired consistency is achieved.

When the coals are uniform gray, scatter a few of the wet wood chips
over them. Rub grill with a paper towel dipped in vegetable oil.
Brush ribs with basting sauce and place them on the grill. Cover with
smoker lid (leave vents about half-open). Grill the ribs for about an
hour, turning about every fifteen minutes and basting as you turn
them. Add wood chips to the coals as necessary to maintain smoke.

Serve ribs with warm basting sauce.

Add Salad Dressing until a smooth consistency is reached (aoli can be
used for those who like a hint of garlic).

Eat as dip, (serves more people), or as a center piece in a bed of

Gastro-Intestinal Team Olympics. I received a few suggestions and
recipe improvements after I posted this originally: Crazy Coyote
recommended Champagne, (not from the Spam Can, but in a more romantic
setting) and a shift to the green-side of the epicurian equation with
the use of the pickle-relish in lieu of the Luau Pineapple approach.
Luis "Burnin' Love" Ayala thought that with a few additional spices,
that it would resemble Mexican Mortadela, and that I should "can it".
I have to agree that anything would improve the ..er.. unique
texture, and await further revisionary opinions from y'all. May the
TCS, the reverends Cardinal Begg and holeyniss Rael, and untold
lurkers of ChileMundo witness that: I hereby submit, for the Spirit

Revised to add soup bases and red pepper flakes 02/11/96 A revised
recipe for my crockpot beans and ham. I used home grown horticulture
beans, added beef and chicken soup base, and red pepper flakes to
spice them up a bit. Got such raves from the family I decided I
better revise the recipe while I still remembered what changes I made
to it. Also decided to try soaking the beans overnight in baking soda
water in an attempt to avoid the usual gassiness. Seems to have
worked quite well, the beans were quite tender without being mushy.

Dow See Jing Pie (Steamed Spareribs With Blac

pork, ham, chinese

1 pound spareribs
1  clove garlic, minced fine
2 tablespoon salted black beans
1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced
1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon sherry

Here's a couple of simple, good recipes that use black bean sauce.
Just in case you don't know, these black beans are the Chinese
fermented black beans.  They're extremely salty++and should be rinsed
before use++ and have a very nice, savory taste that blends well with
many foods. Very common in Chinese markets and I've seen bottles of
ready prepared black bean sauce in supermarkets in the Oriental food
sections. Just substitute the deep fried tofu cubes for the meat in
these recipes. One of these recipes is for pork spareribs and one for
prawns. They'll give you an idea of how the beans are combined with
the other ingredients to come up with the sauce.

Yield: 4 servings

Preparation:  Have butcher cut spareribs into 1-inch pieces. Trim off
fat. Place spareribs in a heat proof dish. Wash and rinse black beans
2 or 3 times, then mash them with garlic, ginger, soy sauce,
cornstarch and sherry.  Mix with spareribs.

Cooking:  Place heat proof dish on steaming rack in wok. Add water to
bottom of wok.  Cover.  Steam for
30    minutes.

Do-ahead notes: Do through preparation.

Comments:  Spareribs can be left in the steamer for 2 hours if dinner
is late.  Substitute bean sauce for salted black beans++and

Sauce.)

Dry Salt Cure For A 14-Lb Ham

pork

1  ham (english hams weigh roughly 14; to 20 lbs)
1 ounce brown sugar
1/2 ounce saltpeter (from the drugstore)
2 pound rough salt

The same method may be used for bacon.  A leg of pork severed from the
whole side is called a ham.  When the leg is left attached to the
side, and severed only after the cure, it is called a gammon.

You will need a salting pan.  Leave the ham unskinned. Rub in the
sugar and the saltpeter first, paying particular attention to the
bone ends. Then rub on half the salt and put the ham to rest on slats
in a slating trough (best if it has a channel for the brine to drain
out). Rub in the rest of the salt at the end of a week. Leave the ham
to take the salt for a total of 3 weeks (depending on the size of the
ham), turning regularly. Then hang the ham to dry in a draft of warm
air for a day or two. If you would like to smoke your own, you will
need a barrel smoker or a smoking shed. Light the fire with kindling
first, then feed it with beech, birch, or oak sawdust. Smoke over the
open end of a smoker barrel. Keep the fire smoldering constantly - it
is not good for the cure to allow changes in temperature.

Twenty-four hours in the smoke shoudl suffice for a ham; 6 hours is
enough for a side of bacon.  York hams are then hung to mature for 2
to 3 months in a tgemperature and humidity controlled room.

Time:  3 weeks plus.

Dublin Coddle

pork

1 pound bacon bits (preferably smoked)
1 pound meaty sausages (spicy ones if you c; an find them)
3 large onions
3 large potatoes (or even four)
1  parsley, fresh; handful
1  pepper

Don't omit the parsley, and don't use dried parsley as a substitute.
It makes a big difference.

"Bacon bits" in Ireland refers to the chopped-up leftovers from
various other cuts of smoked or cured pork or bacon, usually with the
pork rind still on. This is wonderful if you can get it. If your
butcher doesn't carry off-cuts or ends of bacon, ask him for the
cheapest cut of pork he has that has a good mixture of fat and lean,
and ask him for some salt pork or fat back as well. Anything smoked
is preferable. This can be cubed and go into the dish with the rest
of the pork, to add flavor.

Get good quality pork sausages, flavorful ones, and preferably ones
without cereal fillers. Spicy sausages work well in this (though they
wouldn't be terribly traditional:  typically about the only herb or
spice you find in Irish sausage is a little sage or thyme). Peel the
onions and potatoes: chop the onions roughly, and chop the potatoes
into three or four pieces each. Chop the fresh parsley. Layer the
ingredients in a flameproof casserole with a tight-fitting, heavy
lid, in this order: onions, sausages, potatoes, bacon, a grind of
pepper: and so on, until you run out of ingredients. Add 2 cups of
water to the pot -- no more. Bring the contents of the pot up to a
boil, without stirring. Then cover the pot, lower the heat to the
barest simmer --only a bubble or two should come to the surface every
now and then -- or put it in a low to medium oven, say about 275 F.
And just leave it there. Come back in anywhere from 3 to 5 hours.
Recommended to eat with this dish: soda bread, or potato farl (see
elsewhere for recipes for these), and Guinness. (Draft Guinness is
now being exported in bottles and cans...) This is friendly, homely
food: not the kind of thing you offer to guests at a fancy dinner
party, but good for when you just need something sustaining.

The original meaning of "coddle" was to cook something very slowly
over a low heat (and this usage is still heard regarding "coddled"
eggs): only later, and by derivation from this meaning, came the
sense of the word meaning "to handle something very gently". Dublin
coddle is a slow-cook dish, famous for being good to have after a
long night at the pub: it also has a slightly doleful reputation as
one of the foods served to people after funerals, since it can be
left unattended for long periods without coming to harm. Various
Irish literary figures, specifically Jonathan Swift (or Dean Swift as
the Irish tend to call him) were reported to be very fond of coddle.
The problem is understanding why, since many coddle recipes are
incredibly bland. This one is the best version we've been able to
track down.

By the way, some people believe in offering the pot a nice half-cup
or so of Guinness itself, before putting the lid on. We haven't tried
this ourselves, but it sounds sociable.

NOTE:  a "Bottled Draft" Guinness is now available in some parts of
the States:  it comes in six-packs, the bottles being stumpy rather
than the usual long-necked shape, and the packing contains an
injector syringe to produce the proper creamy head on an otherwise
smooth beer. Despite what come out of the pull-tab cans, Guinness is
*not* usually fizzy -- it's a side-effect of the canning process.
(This has led to the odd situation over here of draft and
bottled/canned Guinness being regarded as two different drinks. Draft
is for slow, leisurely consumption, for the lubrication of gossip and
discussion, and for the refreshment of the spirit. Bottled/canned
Guinness is a thirst-quencher, and not much else.)

Guinness in the keg is also notorious for not travelling well
anywhere off the island of Ireland, even just across the Irish Sea to
England. The Port of Liverpool seems to have come to some
arrangement, but hardly anywhere else. Even the best Irish Pub in the
States can't do anything about the width of the Atlantic Ocean that
separates them from Uncle Arthur's brewery in Dublin. These fat
little bottles are worth looking for; try serving your Guinness in
the old style, at "cellar temperature" rather than chilled. Put the
bottles (or cans, if that's all you can find) into a sink full of
cold water (no ice) rather than your fridge. Leave for an hour.
Enjoy. Repeat as necessary.

9 pound pork, preferably trimmed
1  half shoulders, in about 3

      ----BRINE----
      ----SAUCE----
      ----DIRECTIONS----

1 c  Good wine or cider vinegar 1 c Water 1 teaspoon Freshly ground black
pepper
1/4 teaspoon  Ground red pepper 1 ea Bay leaf, crumbled 1 teaspoon Rosemary
twigs 3 tablespoon Raw
turbinado sugar, brown -sugar, honey or molasses 2 tablespoon Salt 1/2 c
Catsup 1/2
c Canned crushed tomatoes 1/2 c Good wine or cider vinegar 2 tablespoon Raw
turbinado sugar, brown -sugar, honey or molasses 1 ea Or 2 fresh chilies,
seeds -and membranes optionally ~removed, -OR- Dried whole or crushed red
~chilies 1 ea Clove garlic, crushed 1 tablespoon Soy sauce 1 teaspoon Dried
thyme, oregano,
or -sage 1/2 c Sliced onions Stir the Brine ingredients to dissolve. Rinse
and wash the pork in running water. Immerse the pork chunks in brine poured
into heavy plastic bags. Force the air from the bags and seal. Marinate the
pork for 12 to 18 hours in the refrigerator, turning twice. The meat should
"cure" to a light gray and become firm. Smoking: Prepare electric smoke
oven with at least a quart of water and a good handful of wook chips or
twigs. Use hardwoods or fruitwoods in the chip tray. Soak them to prolong
the smoke. Spray racks with vegetable cooking spray. Place pork on racks
without piercing with a fork.  Smoke the meat at a bare sizzling
temperature (175 degrees F) for 4 to  4 1/2 hours. Replenish the water pan
or chip tray if necessary. Remove pork and disconnect smoker. Allow the
meat to cool for half an hour. Trim the meat of skin and fat, and remove
the meat from bones. Using a large knife or cleaver, slice, dice and mince
the meat.  The meat should still be slightly pink, even when fully cooked.
This is a characteristic of smoke ovens. (The cooking is not completed yet,
however.) Simmer the sauce ingredients gently for 1 hour or until slightly
thickened. Allow it to cook, stirring occasionally. Blend the minced pork
with the sauce, reserving 1/2 cup of sauce for the table. Pack into
casserole dishes, cover, and heat in a 200F oven for 1 hour. Uncover, stir,
and serve. EnjoyIngredients:

Easy Sweet & Sour Pork

meats, pork, oriental, wok

      ----PART 1----
1 1/2 pound lean pork butt or fresh ham
3/16 cup soya sauce
3/16 cup sherry
1  salt
2 tablespoon oil
      ----PART 2----
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup white vinegar
1 1/2 tablespoon corn starch, dissolved in
1/4 cup water
1/4 cup pineapple juice
3 tablespoon tomato soup
      ----SUGGESTED EMBELLISHMENTS----
1/4 cup pineapple chunks
1  few pieces of raw carrot, sliced or; shredded
1/2  green pepper shredded
1  tomato, cut into wedges
1/2 cup mixed sweet pickles

PART 1:

1. Cut pork into 1/2x1/2x1" rectangles. Marinate in mixture of salt,
soya sauce and sherry for at least half an hour. While meat is
marinating, prepare Part 2.

2. Add 2 tablespoons oil to wok and heat up to smoking point. Take a
slotted spoon and use it to lift pork pieces from marinate, place in
wok and brown meat on all sides. Lower heat slightly to medium high
and continue to cook meat for a full 15 minutes, using turner to stir
pieces occasionally.

3. At end of cooking time, place meat in serving dish. Pour sauce
from Part 2 over it.

PART 2:

1. Place white sugar and vinegar in a small 1 quart pot. Boil together
until sugar is dissolved. Stir up corn starch in 1/4 cup water. Add to
vinegar-sugar boil. Stir solution, lower heat to medium low, add
pineapple juice and tomato soup. Boil solution 15-20 minutes, until
it turns from milky red to a clear reddish yellow.

2. Add suggested embellishments. You can use all of them or some of
them. Cook 2 minutes. Serve over Part 1.

NOTE: Pork spare ribs cut into 1 1/2" lengths may be used in place of
pork butt. However, spare ribs have more fat than fresh ham or pork
butt, so use 1 tablespoon less oil in stir-frying ribs or else
discard fat which accumulates in wok when ribs are finished cooking.
Also Part 2 (sans embellishments) can be made in a larger quantity
and store in a covered plastic container in refrigerator for 2-3
weeks.

Egg Pancake Rolls With Pork Filling

appetizers, pork, breakfast

4  eggs
1 tablespoon dry sherry
1  carrots, finely chopped
1  (for garnish)
      ----FILLING----
1 cup (about 1/2 pound) ground pork,
1  uncooked
2 medium fresh mushrooms,
1  chopped fine
2  scallions, chopped fine
1  (white parts separate from
1  the green)
2 teaspoon cornstarch, dissolved in
2 tablespoon water, cold
1/2 tablespoon dark soy sauce
1 tablespoon dry sherry
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon peanut oil
      ----SAUCE----
2 tablespoon oyster sauce
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
1 tablespoon plum sauce
1  dash hot chili oil or
1  Tabasco
1  sauce

In a bowl, stir the eggs with the dry sherry. In a mixing bowl,
combine all the filling ingredients, include only the white parts of
the chopped scallions (save the green parts for garnish) and stir to
blend well. In a 8-inch skillet, heat the oil lightly.  Pour about a
quarter of the egg mixture to cover the bottom of the skillet. Heat
until the egg pancake has barely set, then transfer to a plate. Make
3 more pancakes. Divide the filling into 4 portions and put a
portions on each pancake. Moisten your fingers with cold water and
spread the filling mixture evenly over the surface of the pancake,
then roll up tightly, as you would a jelly roll. Seal with a little
leftover egg from the egg-beating bowl. Place the rolls on a flat
plate that will fit your steamer, and then steam them over an inch of
simmering water for 15 minutes. In a bowl, mix together the sauce
ingredients.  To serve, cut the rolls into slices, cutting on the
slant. Drizzle the sauce over them and top with the scallion greens
and the carrots.  Makes 6 to 8 appetizer servings.

gently lift the cooked portion with a fork or spatula so that the
uncooked egg mixture can run under the cooked portion.  Avoid
constant stirring as this will make the eggs tough and hard. Cook

El Ham Lahlou (Sweet Lamb For Ramadhan)

holidays, lamb, algerian

3 tablespoon butter
1 pound lamb; in 3-inch pieces
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, ground
3 cup water
1/4 cup sugar
12  dried prunes soaked in water for on; e hour
2 tablespoon white raisins
2 tablespoon whole blanched almonds
1  firm pear; peel/core/wedges
2 tablespoon orange blossom water

The holy celebration of Ramadhan is when the Algerian Muslims eat this
sweet lamb after a day of fasting. It is almost a dessert meat, with
raisins, prunes, sugar, almonds and orange blossom water, and it is
cooked without salt, to prevent thirst the next day for those fasting.

1. Melt the butter in a pan, add the lamb and saute over low heat for
5 minutes. Add the cinnamon, water and sugar and mix well. Increase
the heat to moderate and cook for about 40 minutes, or until the meat
is tender. The sauce will darken.

2. Drain the prunes and add them to the lamb with the raisins,
almonds and pear. Simmer for 15 minutes more. Remove the pan from the
heat and stir in the orange blossom water.

Serve at room temperature with rice, salad and bread. Serves 4 to 6
with other dishes.

Empanaditas  (Pork Turnovers)

pork

8 teaspoon chilled margarine
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoon ice water
2 ounce cooked ground pork, crumbled (or fi; nely chopped
1  cooked ham)
2 ounce monterey jack or Cheddar cheese, sh; redded
1 teaspoon prepared spicy brown mustard
1 dash crushed red pepper
1  egg separated
1 tablespoon skim milk

Paprika Garnish: red bell pepper strips and cilantro leaves

In small bowl, with pastry blender or 2 knives, cut margarine into
flour until mixture resembles corn meal; sprinkle with ice water and,
using fork, mix to form soft dough. Roll dough between 2 sheets of
wax paper to form rectangle about 1/4 inch thick; remove paper and
use 2-inch diameter plain or fluted cookie cutter to cut dough into
rounds. Roll scraps of dough and continue cutting until all dough has
been used (should yield 24 rounds). Combine pork (or ham), cheese,
mustard, and red pepper in small bowl and set aside. Preheat oven to
375.

Beat egg white lightly and brush an equal amount onto each pastry
round. Spoon an equal amount of the meat mixture (about 1/2 rounded
teaspoon) onto center of each round; fold pastry over,
turnover-fashion, to enclose filling.  Press edges of dough together
to seal. Transfer turnovers to nonstick cookie sheet. Add milk to egg
yolk and beat lightly; brush an equal amount of mixture over each
turnover and sprinkle each with a dash of paprika.  Bake until
turnovers are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to warmed
serving tray; garnish with red pepper strips and cilantro. Chili
sauce or salsa can be served as a dipping sauce.

Makes 8 servings of 3 turnovers each.

5 pound fresh ham
8  scallions
3 tablespoon peanut oil
8 slice fresh ginger
4  garlic cloves  peeled and crushed
      ----BRAISING LIQUID----
5 cup hot water
1 cup dark soy sauce
1 cup rice wine or dry sherry
3 tablespoon roasted sichuan peppercorns (whole)
6 tablespoon rock or ordinary sugar
4  star anise
2  cinnamon sticks or bark
2 teaspoon five-spice powder
1 teaspoon salt

DRY THE HAM THOROUGHLY with paper towels. Cut the scallions into
3-inch segments. Choose a heavy casserole or pot, large enough to
hold the ham comfortably. Heat the pot and then add the oil, ginger,
garlic and scallions, and stir-fry in the pot for 2 minutes. Push the
aromatics to the side and brown the ham on each side until it has
some color, 10 to 15 minutes. Pour off the oil. Add all the braising
liquid ingredients to the pot and bring the mixture to a boil. Turn
the heat down to a simmer, cover tightly and cook for about 4 1/2
hours, turning the ham from time to time. When the ham is tender,
remove it gently with a large spatula. The meat should be literally
falling apart. Place it on a serving platter. Strain the sauce, skim
off any surface fat, and reduce the liquid until it is slightly
thick. Pour this over the ham and serve.

Don't sell the kohl crops short.  Try collards and savoy. They are
still doing quite well in the garden despite 15 F. temperatures
lately. Savoy is a joy to eat at Yule. The frost seems to sweeten and
intensify the flavor. Our annual homemade sauerkraut is making its
presence known by the merry burbling of the water-seal crocks in the
utility room. This is the best time of the year to make kraut.  It is
cool and the fermentation takes a longer time, leaving the salted
sour cabbage as crisp as the bright windy day in October it was put
up.

We are lucky to have antique apple trees.  Three bushels of mixed
russets are slumbering in the garage and will last until spring. Fie
on the Granny Smiths and Red Delicious! A Golden Russet or Ashmeads
Kernel, peeled and sliced, served with a wedge of sharp Cheddar at
your side on a winter evening while reading a good book is one of
lifes great luxuries.

Rereading this post makes me hungry.  No I'm not going to crack open a
fruit cake!  They are not ready for another month. Besides, my
nocturnal rustlings are not always appreciated around here, except
for the ever present cats who always look for a handout.  The coffee
is ready though and I think I remember where Frances stashed some
homemade cookies.

Flaeskeaeggekage (Bacon & Egg Cake)

cheese/eggs, pork

1/2 pound bacon; preferably danish
6  eggs; lightly beaten
1 tablespoon flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup milk
3 tablespoon chives; finely cut

Cut the long strips of bacon in half crosswise and then fry them over
moderate heat in a heavy skillet. Do not let them get too crisp.
Drain the strips on paper towels and set them on a ovenproof platter
or baking dish and keep warm in a 200ø oven. Remove all but a
tablespoon of the clear bacon fat from the skillet. In a mixing bowl,
beat the flour and salt into the eggs only long enough to combine
them and then slowly beat in the milk. Warm the fat in the skillet
over moverate heat and pour in the egg mixture. Turn the heat down to
low and, without stirring, let the eggs set into a firm custard.
Since this will take about 20 minutes, an asbestos pad placed under
the skillet will help to prevent the bottom of the egg cake from
curning. Arrange the bacon slices and shives over the top of the
finished cake. Serve directly from the pan as a first course, brunch
or late supper dish.

Flaeskesteg Med Svaer (Roast Ham With Crackli

main dish, pork

1/2  fresh ham (butt or shank) weighing; about 6 lb. -=or=-
6 pound shoulder of pork w/rind on
1  coarse salt or regular salt
1  fresh ground black pepper

Preheat oven to 300øF. Using a sharp, heavy knife, cut deeply through
the rind and fat until you reach the meat, making the incisions 1/2"
apart lengthwise and crosswise. Rub salt and pepper liberally into
these gashes. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the
ham and place it on a rack set in a shallow roasting pan just large
enough to hold the meat comfortably. Roast slowly 4 to 4 1/2 hours or
until the meat thermometer reads 180øF. Do not baste the meat. When
roasted, the meat should be moist and tender and the rind (or
crackling) very crisp. Let the roast rest outside the oven for 10-15
minutes for easier carving. A little of the crackling should be
included in each serving of meat.

Flesh Of The Pig Ala Bob Greenberg

pork

      ----BASIC RIBS----
3 pound country ribs or other
1 cup cider vinegar
2 tablespoon black pepper fine ground
2 tablespoon garlic salt
      ----SAUCE FOR REHEATING----
1  open pit small bottle
1  small bottle a-1 sauce
1/4 cup molasses
1  supply of hickory chips

Regular old supermarket pork. Spare ribs, country ribs, or any other
pork Not too much fat. Cut off any gross excess, and cut them to EVEN
thickness. You'll ruin everything if you cook the meat unevenly. You
may compensate by scoring the meat. In a large baking pan, soak the
ribs with cider vinegar, after which sprinkle them with garlic salt
and finely ground black pepper. (Don't use pepper mills, or other
peppers.) It doesn't seem to matter how long the ribs soak, or how
much vinegar is on them. Just make sure it hits all sides, you don't
have to puncture them. This sweetens the meat. The key to the fire is
the hickory chips. Keep feeding these amazing little fellows to the
charcoal. The flavor comes out of these chips and you cannot do
without them. Make sure the fat and chips don't light up your whole
dinner and ruin it.

Cooking: A moderate hot fire a couple of inches or more from the
meat, and a grill of reasonable cleanness. As the meat cooks turn it
often, do not let it burn, do not baste it with anything. Don't cover
the grill and don't stray too far -- fire is always hiding in the
wings. Here is the catch -- the trick -- the hard part, is the
timing. You may ruin some meals before you hit it, but the time to
take them off the grill is one minute after trichina danger is past.
As soon as the meat turns brown it's time to eat. You can use the
small strips you cut off to judge just when things are perfect.

Special Purpose Sauce: (don't eat it cold, it's awful) 1 bottle Open
Pit, One bottle A-1 Sauce, 1/4 C of molasses. Start re-heating the
sauce until slow boil, dump in the cold pork from the fridge. alt.
without sauce wrap the meat in foil and heat at 325 oven for 15-20
minutes. Sauce can be stored and re-used, but remember it will have
pork fat in it now.

Fried Ham With Red-Eyed Gravy

Ham slices, like all other pork, should be fried well done, but never hard
and dry.  It is always well to serve tart appple sauce or fried apples with
ham or pork of any kind.  The tart in the apple kills the effect of the
grease.

Red-eyed gravy is made with the pparticles that stick to the skiillet after
ham is fried.  Pour off the fat into a small bowl, add about 6 tablespoon.

boil loose from the skiillet.  Pour this into the fat and let set a few
minutes.  Dip to the bottom and put it over hot biscuits or any other kind
of bread, and you have something goood. We kids of the hills call thes
"red-eyed gravy" because of the red particles that rise with the fat.

Goan Pork Vindaloo In Pungent Brown Sauce

pork, indian

2 pound boneless pork shoulder
1 1/2  piece tamarind pulp (see note)
14  dried red chile peppers, seeded, co; arsely chopped
1 1/2  sticks cinnamon
20  cloves teaspoons coriander seeds
2 teaspoon cumin seeds
2 teaspoon black mustard seeds
3/4 teaspoon black pepper corns
2 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
2 tablespoon minced garlic
1/2 cup cider vinegar
1/2 cup peanut oil
2  onions, chopped
1  salt

It's interesting, as I go through this humungous pile of newspapers,
to see how my tastes have changed over the past three years. Some of
the things I marked then, I find myself discarding now. Some of the
stuff that didn't interest me at the time, I'm scanning to save. This
one was on the list then and is still on the list.

Trim the meat and cut into 3/4-inch pieces.

Place the tamarind in a nonmetallic bowl; pour in 1 1/2 cups hot
water and let soak at least 1 hour.  Work the tamarind with fingers
to squeeze out as much pulp and juice as possible. Strain into a bowl
and set aside. Discard the residue.

Heat a dry skillet over medium heat.  Add the chile peppers, cinnamon
sticks, cloves, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, mustard seeds and black
peppercorns; roast the spices, stirring and shaking the skillet
constantly, until the coriander, cumin and chile peppers turn several
shades darker, and all the spices release their fragrance. This will
take 3 to 4 minutes, Transfer to a bowl and let cool.  Grind the
spices in a spice grinder and set aside.

Put the ginger and garlic in a medium-sized non metallic bowl with the
vinegar.  Blend in the ground, roasted spices. Add the meat and mix
thoroughly to coat with the spice mixture. Cover the bowl and
refrigerate overnight or up to 48 hours.

Heat the oil in a heavy pan, add onions and cook until they turn
reddish brown, 12 to 20 minutes.  Add the meat (with its marinade) in
two batches, stirring and searing the pieces over medium-high heat.
Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring frequently, until almost all
the liquid evaporates and fat separates from the mixture. You will
see small pools of fat on the surface.

Stir in the tamarind and some salt; cover and simmer until the meat
is very tender, about 1 hour.  Check the water content from time to
time, and add 1/4 cup hot water once or twice. Serve hot with steamed
rice.

NOTE:  Tamarind is found in cake form at Indian markets.

Granny's Ham & Potato Gratin For A Crowd

pork

10 pound boiling potatoes
1  salt
8 cup garlic and mustard sauce
5 ounce butter
1 cup all-purpose flour
6 1/2 cup hot milk
1  salt and freshly ground pepper
1 pinch nutmeg
2 large cloves of garlic, pureed
1/4 cup dijon-type prepared mustard
1/2 teaspoon thyme or sage
4 cup coarsely grated cheese *
1 1/2 quart to 2 qts cooked ham **

* Swiss or a mixture such as Swiss, mozzarella, Jack, and/or Cheddar
[I actually used all four kinds. Worked out okay. S.C.] ** diced,
thinly sliced, or ground (to make 6 to 8 cups)

Here's my contribution to the thread on scalloped potatoes and ham.
As far as I'm concerned, no others need apply. This is the best I've
ever tasted. It's from my new Julia Child book, "The Way to Cook".

Also++since the recipe is for 18 to 24 servings++it'll give the folks
with amount-converting recipe programs a chance to put them through
their paces. ;-}

Here is a great crowd pleaser, as well as a deliciously economical
one that needs only a copious salad, a loaf of bread, and a jug of
light red wine to make the meal.

For 18 to 24 servings

SPECIAL EQUIPMENT SUGGESTED:

A food processor is useful for slicing and grating; and 8-quart
covered kettle; a heavy-bottomed 3-quart saucepan, for the sauce; a
buttered 6-quart baking dish about 3 inches deep, for the final dish

THE POTATOES:

Have ready the kettle containing 4 cups of cold water. Peel the
potatoes and slice them 1/4 inch thick, dropping them into the cold
water to cover as you do so. Cover the kettle, and bring to the boil.
Uncover and boil slowly for 3 to 4 minutes, until barely cooked
through++eat several slices to check.  Drain, cover the kettle again
for 3 to 4 minutes to firm up the potato slices, then uncover.

THE GARLIC AND MUSTARD SAUCE:

Make the classic white sauce; cook the butter and flour together in
the saucepan until they foam and froth for 2 minutes without
coloring. Off heat pour in half the hot milk; whisk vigorously to
blend as you pour in the rest; simmer for 3 minutes, stirring. Remove
from heat and whisk in the seasonings; bring to the simmer again;
taste carefully, and add additional seasonings to taste.  [I didn't
type in the sauce referred to. It was essentially a longer version of
what's given above along with tips on handling it. S.C.]

ASSEMBLING:

Spoon a 1/16-inch layer of sauce on the bottom of the buttered baking
dish. Set aside 3 cups of the sauce and 1 cup of the cheese for the
topping. Now, to arrange everything in 4 layers, start with a quart
of the potatoes, then a quarter of the ham, follow by a third of the
sauce and sprinkle on a third of the cheese. Continue in layers,
finishing the final layer with the remaining potatoes and ham; spread
on the reserved 3 cups of sauce to cover completely, then the last of
the cheese.

AHEAD OF TIME NOTE:  May be prepared a day in advance, cover when
cool and refrigerate.

An hour or so before you plan to serve, preheat the oven to 375f.

Bake in the upper third level just until the potatoes are bubbling
hot and the top has browned nicely. About 45 minutes.

AHEAD OF TIME NOTE:  May be kept warm uncovered on a hot tray but be
sure not to overheat or the potatoes and ham will dry out.

Grilled Loin Of Pork With Tart Cherry Sauce

pork

4 pound boneless pork loin roast, fat trimm; ed
1  salt
1  pepper
1 cup dry red wine
1/2 cup orange juice
3 tablespoon chopped shallots or onions
1  clove garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon minced ginger root
1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
1/8 teaspoon pepper
3 tablespoon cornstarch
1/3 cup cold water
1 pound fresh or frozen cherries
1/4  to 1/3 cup nutrasweet spoonful

Dunno how you feel about NutriSweet and such ilk, but I'm posting a
bunch of stuff from NutriSweets cookbook. Some of it looks right
good. Tart cherries in a red wine sauce are the perfect complement to
roast pork, while they give a dinnertime favorite new taste appeal.

Lightly sprinkle the roast with salt and pepper; place on rack in
roasting pan.  Insert meat thermometer so tip is in center of meat.
Roast at 325F until thermometer registers 170F, about 2 hours.

Heat the wine, orange juice, shallots, garlic, ginger root, allspice
and 1/8 teaspoon pepper to boiling in medium saucepan; reduce heat to
low and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes.

Heat to boiling once more.  Mix cornstarch and cold water; stir into
boiling mixture.  Boil, stirring constantly, until thickened. Stir in
cherries; cook over low heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat;
cool for 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in NutraSweet Spoonful. Slice pork and
arrange on platter; serve with Cherry Sauce.

NOTE:  Tart Cherry Sauce is also excellent served with venison or
other game.

Makes 12 servings.

Gruiben (Cracklings)

pork, german

2 1/2 kg fresh pork bacon [the fatty layer r; ight underneath
1  the skin.  k.b.] (approx. 5 1/2 pou; )
1/8 liter milk or water (1/2 cup plus 1/2 tbs; p)

Cut the bacon into 3/4-inch cubes and put into a tall pot which must
not get filled more than halfway up (to prevent the large amount of
foam during the rendering process from running over and spilling).
Heat up slowly, else the bacon will stick to the bottom and scorch.
As soon as there is a little liquid fat covering the bottom of the
pot, add milk or water, and heat up more, constantly stirring.  Let
the cracklings brown a little bit more, then pour off the liquid
lard, through a sieve, into an earthenware pot. Warm cracklings are
very popular in-between meal.

Hackbraten (Falscher Has) Mock Rabbit

ham, beef, german

250 gm ground pork (a generous 1/2 pound)
250 gm ground beef (a generous 1/2 pound)
100 gm plain breadcrumbs (3.5 ounce)
2  eggs
1  onion, finely chopped
1  clove garlic, mashed or minced
1 bunch parsley, finely chopped
1 pinch sugar
2 tablespoon lard
1  onion, sliced
4  to 5 cloves garlic, whole
1/2  yellow turnip, sliced [substitute:; carrot]
1  water for pan gravy

Mix the ground meat with all the other ingredients [except for the
lard, the sliced yellow turnip, sliced onion, and whole garlic
cloves] and shape into a rectangular loaf. Put in a casserole dish
with the lard, the sliced onion, whole garlic cloves, and sliced
yellow turnip. Roast at 390 degrees F until the onions turn brown.
Then, add a little bit of water. Continue to roast, basting
frequently.  Add more water as needed. If the crust is getting too
dark, cover the top of the meatloaf with aluminum foil. In the olden
days, the cook put a clay tile on top of the meatloaf to achieve the
same effect.

At 390 degrees F, the meatloaf will be done after 1 1/2 hours and may
be served immediately, sliced, and topped with the reheated pan
juices.

Serve with potato salad or green salad [lettuce].

Serves 4.

[Note:  'Falscher Has' literally means imitation rabbit. K.B.]

fruits, sauces, ham

2 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon shallots, chopped fine
1 cup cubed ripe tomatoes
6 tablespoon dry white wine
1 cup heavy cream
1 pound thinly sliced ham
1 1/2 cup small white seedless grapes

1. Preheat the oven to 400. 2. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan
and add the shallots. Cook briefly, then add the tomatoes. Cook about
10 min., stirring occasionally. Add 4 tablespoon of the wine and cook about
3 min. Stir in the cream. Simmer about 15 min. 3. Butter a oval
baking dish( a dish measuring about 9 x 12 x 2 in. is ideal). Roll up
the ham slices into cigarette shapes not quite 1-in. in diameter.
Arrange the rolls close together in the dish, side by side in a neat
row. Melt the remaining butter and brush over the ham rolls. Set
aside. 4. Put the sauce through a fine strainer. Return to the
saucepan and cook about 5 min. longer. 5. Meanwhile, place the grapes
in a small skillet with the remaining wine. Bring to a boil and cook,
shaking the skillet, about 3 min. Do not over cook or the grapes will
become mushy. They must retain a nice texture and shape. Add the
sauce and bring to a boil, stirring. 6. Place the ham in the oven and
bake about 5 min., just to heat through. 7. Pour the grapes and the
sauce over the ham.

Ham With Green String Beans (Speck Und Beans)

ham, penn dutch

3 pound ham, smoked
1 single water
1 quart string beans
5 each medium potato
1 single salt and pepper

*** My notes: I think the recipes in this cookbook all assume using a
whole, uncooked ham. I would omit the step of boiling ham for 3 hours
if using a cooked ham. Cover the piece of ham with cold water and set
over a low flame to cook for 3 hours. Add water from time to time
during cooking in order to have at least one quart of broth at all
times. Wash and clean the string beans, break into small pieces and
add to the ham. Continue cooking about 25 minutes. Pare and quarter
the potatoes; add to the beans and ham and cook about 25 or 30
minutes, or until beans and potatoes are tender. About 15 minutes
before serving, add salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot, providing
vinegar for those who like the dish strongly flavored. Source:

Ham With Noodles (Schinkennudeln)

pasta, pork, german

3/4 pound fresh egg noodles
1/2 pound ham, diced
1  salt
1 cup sour cream
3 tablespoon grated swiss cheese (emmentaler)
1 tablespoon to 2 tb butter
2 tablespoon bread crumbs

This is one of the most popular German casseroles, especially south
of the Main Line.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

Cook the noodles in salted water and drain; they can also be left
over from the day before.  Fill a souffle pan with alternate layers
of ham and noodles; salt lightly and put some of the sour cream and
some grated cheese over each layer.  The top layer should consist of
noodles. Dot with little bits of butter and sprinkle with bread
crumbs.

Bake in the oven for about 30 minutes.

Variations:

This version of the recipe comes from Swabia; feel free to increase
the proportions of the costlier ingredients (ham, butter, sour cream)
as your fancy dictates.

In another version of this casserole, the ingredients are all mixed
together in one bowl, along with 3 eggs, the souffle pan is well
greased with butter (always recommended), and the contents of the
bowl transferred to the pan, the proceed as described above.

Makes 4 servings.

meats, cheese

1 cup ground chicken (dark meat)
1  (hamburger grind)
1/2 cup breadcrumbs, seasoned
1  egg
4 ounce cooked ham slices, chopped
4 ounce shredded cheese
1  mozzarella or swiss
1  water or white wine
1 centiliter garlic, finely minced
1 pkg egg roll wrappers
1  pepper

Mix ground chicken, seasoned crumbs and egg with hands. Add water if too
dense. Pat out about 1/4 inch thick on a cookie sheet that has been covered
with saran. Cover and let set up in refigerator for about an hour.

Chop the cooked ham (boiled ham, whatever) in very small dice. Mix with
finely grated cheese of choice. Add garlic and pepper to taste. Mix with
enough white wine or water to make it hold together a little. Spread on
chicken mix. Using edge of saran, pull the sheet up a little and roll the
edge over on itself. Cut with sharp knife along edge opposite fold. Repeat
folding and cutting until you use up sheet of mix. Cut little "log" into
several parts equaling 2 1/2 to 3 inches. Lay log diagonally on egg roll
wrapper.Dampen edges of wrapper with water. Turn up opposite points on ends
of log. Turn one loose side over and tuck, then roll it to complete the
roll.

Place rolls on a baking sheet, cover and put in the refrigerator for about
an hour to "set" the wrapper. Drop in moderately hot fat and cook until
browned, or, place on cookie sheet and bake for 45 minutes or until meat is
cooked.

NOTE: Make sure, if you fry them, to have the grease lower than usually so
the chicken gets cooked thoroughly.

Hamburger Basics

bbq, beef

18 ounce ground chuck -- 85%
3 large english muffins
1  freshly ground pepper
      Toppings-----
1  cheese sliced
1  lettuce
1  tomatoes -- sliced
1  onion -- sliced
1  bacon

Use freshly ground beef. Take the ground beef and break it apart in a
large bowl. Grind the pepper over it and mix with a large fork, I
find the 2-tined one with the long handle works best. Divide the meat
into three mounds on waxed paper. Form the mounds into patties. DO
NOT PRESS it tight, just kind of gather it up and form the patties,
pressing lightly to form(about 1 to 1 1/2-inches thick). Grill over
medium high heat until the juices just begin to appear on the top,
then flip it over and continue cooking for about half the time took
for the first side. Serve of toasted muffins with whatever toppings
you like.

If you press the meat tight, you end up with tuff fast-food stype
burger

I do not use salt in the mixture because it tuffings the meat and
draws out the juices. Salt can added, if desires, when assembling
finished burgers.

Other herbs can be added to the meat when mixing, but I find that a
good burger is one were the meat is left alone and the toppings are
added later.

Hamburger Gravey

hamburger, beef

1  pepper
3 medium onions, chopped
1 pound ground chuck
1 1/2 cup water + 2 tb
1  beef bouillion cube
1  pepper

Contributed to the echo by: Marge Hamburger Gravy Okay... several
onions, maybe 2 large or three medium, very coarsely chopped. 1 pound
hamburger, probably ground chuck or leaner. Scramble/brown the
hamburger and onions together over medium heat, keeping the meat
chopped as finely as possible, you don't want big clumps in this,
until meat is cooked, and onion translucent. Drain off the excess
grease from the meat, trying to leave about a tablespoon or two in
the skillet. Sprinkle a scant two tablespoons of water over the meat
mixture, and stir it in well over low to medium heat. Add
approximately a cup and a half of water, and stir to blend. (You
might want to toss a bouillion cube in at this point, won't hurt it
any!) Simmer, stirring, until the "gravy" thickens... Taste and see
about adding a healthy shake or three of pepper and (if you omitted
the bouillion cube) a dash of salt. Won't hurt it to stay warm on the
back of the stove for a while while the potatoes finish boiling, the
flavor will go into the gravy more that way. Howzat for indefinite?
But there WAS no recipe...we just made it!

Hamburger Petal Pie

meats

1 cup onion, chopped
1 cup green pepper, chopped
1/2  garlic clove, crushed
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 pound hamburger
1/3 cup water
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoon flour
1  egg, slightly beaten
1 pound biscuits, canned

Saute the onion, green pepper and garlic in the oil until tender then add
the beef and cook until brown all over. Dump out the grease and add about
1/3 cup of water. Add the worchestershire sauce, salt, pepper and flour.
Simmer until the juice thickens.

Separate the biscuits and brush the edges with the egg.  Put the biscuits
against the sides and bottom of a pie plate so it is completely covered.

Stir the rest of the egg into the meat mixture and then spoon the meat into
the pie shell.  If you wish you can garnish with a few tomato wedges. Bake
in a pre-heated oven at 450 degrees F. for about 8 to 10 minutes. The
biscuits should be slightly browned.

NOTES:

*  A quick hamburger dish -- I got this recipe from Judy Halter who got it
from her sister.  Yield:  serves 5.

*  This gets its name because the biscuits around the edge puff up to look
like the petals around the center of a sunflower.  This is a great bachelor
meal because you can come in from work and make it without much effort,
time or dish washing. You can play with different spices to change the
flavor. Some of my friends like to put cheese on top before baking it.

*  If you live outside North America, remember that a biscuit is a scone.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking

bun, top with grated cheese of choice; toast *briefly* under broiler

1 tablespoon paprika
2 pound ground turkey
1  onion, chopped
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup dry red wine
2 centiliter garlic, mashed
1 can (8 ounce) can tomato puree
8 ounce catsup
:  salt
:  chopped onion

and catsup and mix well. Season to taste with salt. Cook over low
heat 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Serve hot with chopped

makes a very thick chili. If you wish to make it thinner, add more
tomato juice. ~End Recipe Export- From the tested recipe collection

Harbor Village Bbq Pork

pork, chinese

1  boston pork butt (about 3 1/4 pound; s)
1/4 cup harbor village chef's barbecue mari
1 1/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon salt
2 teaspoon mui gwe lo rice wine
1/3 cup light soy sauce
1 teaspoon five-spice powder
1 cup water (for roasting pan)
1  glazing sauce
      ----barbecue MARINADE----
2/3 cup cooking oil
8  garlic cloves, peeled and minced
1 3/4 cup hoisin sauce
1 3/4 cup ground bean sauce
1 1/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup nam yu (red bean curd cheese)
1/2 cup sesame seed paste
      ----GLAZING SAUCE----
17 1/2 ounce container of maltose sugar
1/4 cup hot water
2 teaspoon mui gwe lo rice wine

Ran across this in the SF paper the other day and, on reading the
ingredients, knew immediately that this is one for you. In the
article that accompanied the recipe the author talks about a Chinese
barbecue oven that the chef who originated this recipe uses.  It's made
out of stainless steel, five feet tall with a 180,000 BTU burner in
it! This is something I really need for my kitchen. This looks like a
full-on, no- nonsense Chinese barbecue.

Most master chefs seldom reveal all their kitchen secrets, but Derun
Yu shared this recipe for a barbecued pork marinade, adapted for the
home oven. Armed with a Chinese rice bowl, he assembled the
ingredients, then poured them into a scale so we would have precise
measurements.

Versatile Chinese barbecued pork is the "ham" of Chinese cooking. It
may be sliced and served as an appetizer or entree, or like a
sandwich, cubed and stuffed in bread dough and steamed into pork
buns. It's good stir- fried with vegetables, tossed with noodles or
cooked with scrambled eggs.

Prepare the marinade:  Heat the oil in a wok or saucepan over
medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and gently fry just until it floats
to the surface and is golden brown (about 2 minutes). Quickly remove
the garlic and discard.  Pour the garlic oil into a large mixing
bowl, let cool.

Stir in remaining ingredients with the garlic oil into a smooth
sauce. Pour into a glass jar. cool.  If the marinade is covered with
1/8 inch cooking oil, it will keep in the refrigerator for several
months.

Yields 5 cups.

Then combine the sugar, salt, rice wine, soy sauce, Barbecue Marinade
and five-spice powder in a large mixing bowl; mix well. Add the pork
butt and marinate for about 30 minutes (when using spareribs,
marinate for 1 hour).

Preheat oven to 500F.  Pour the water into a 10 X 14-inch roasting
pan. Place the roasting rack in the pan (the rack should not touch
the water). Remove the meat slices from the marinade and place on the
rack; reserve the marinade.  Roast for 8 minutes, turn over and roast
the other side for 8 minutes longer.  Reduce the oven temperature to
300F. Brush the pork with the reserved marinade; roast for an
additional 20 minutes on each side. Remove from the oven and let cool
for 5 minutes.

Slice the pork butt into 1/4-inch slices.

Prepare the glazing sauce:  To soften maltose sugar, place the
container (uncovered) in a microwave oven at high setting for 1
minute. Transfer the softened maltose into a double boiler with the
water and rice wine; stir until the glaze is well mixed.  Keep the
sauce warm until ready to use.

Makes 2 cups.

Then spoon a few tablespoons of the glaze over pork before serving.
NOTE: Hoisin sauce, ground bean sauce, nam yu, maltose sugar and
sesame seed paste are available in Chinese markets.

Home-Cooked Carnitas - Carnitas Caseras

mexican, pork, ethnic

1  jim vorheis
4 tablespoon lard
3 pound pork, cut into 2-inch cubes
1/2 medium white onion, roughly sliced
4  fresh marjoram sprigs, or scant 1/4; tsp dried
4  fresh thyme sprigs, or scant 1/4 ts; p dried
3  california bay leaves, broken up
10  peppercorns, crushed
1  orange, cut into eighths
1 cup milk
1  sea salt to taste

Heat the lard in a heavy pan, add the meat, and fry, stirring and
turning it over from time to time, until lightly golden - about 8
minutes. Add the onion and stir well. Cook for 8 minutes longer or
until the meat is well browned (remove onion only if it has burned).
Add the remaining ingredients, cover the pan, and cook over low heat
until the meat is just tender, not falling apart - about 20 minutes,
depending on the quality of the meat.  There should be plenty of pan

Honey Baked Ham

meats, pork, wine

1  smoked ready-to-eat ham, 13 to 15 p; ounds
2  to 3 bottles gingerale
3 cup dry white wine
1  glaze:
5 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1/3 cup honey
1/3 cup real maple syrup
1  sauce:
1 1/4 cup chicken stock
3 tablespoon real maple syrup
2 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 teaspoon cornstarch

Remove the rind and score with diagonal cross-cuts. Put ham in a close
fitting kettle and cover with gingerale. Bring to boil, then simmer
for 20 to 30 minutes. This step removes the too salty taste and adds
a delicate flavor. Drain the gingerale, add ham to a roasting pan and
pour the wine over it.  Cover with foil and bake at 350~ for 1 hour.

Combine the glaze ingredients.  After the ham has baked 1 hour, brush
the ham with the glaze, using all of the mixture. Return ham to oven
(uncovered) and bake an additional 1-1/2 hours, or until internal temp
reaches 140~.  Baste occasionally after the glaze has "set", about 45
minutes.  If the glaze gets too dark before the temp gets to 140
degrees, tent the ham with foil.

When ham is done, transfer it to a serving plate and loosely cover
with foil to keep warm.  Skim the fat from the juices, reserving all
the juice and caramelized bits from the glaze. Heat this to a boil
along with 1 cup of the chicken stock (reserving 1/4 cup), syrup and
mustard. Dissolve the cornstarch in 1/4 cup of reserved chicken stock
and whisk it into the sauce to thicken.  The sauce should be a rich
dark color. Strain and pour into a gravy boat.  Serve the sauce over
the ham.

NOTE *** In step 1, "close fitting kettle" means the tightest fitting
kettle you can fit the ham into, so it takes less gingerale to cover
it.

Hopping John

pork, rice

4  strips bacon
1/2 cup raw rice
1/4 cup onion
2 cup water
2 cup fresh blackeye peas
1  salt and pepper to taste

Dice bacon. Add onion and fry until bacon is crisp. Add peas and
rice, then water.  Cover and simmer over low heat for about 20
minutes or until rice is tender. ( I *ALWAYS* add a good sized shake
or two of Louisiana Hot sauce (NOT Tabasco, there is a difference)
Yields 10 servings

This is the basic recipe (from Southern Living)  It can be adjusted in
several ways:

1)  substitute ham hocks for bacon by boiling them in the 2 C water
until the meat comes off the bone.  Fry onion in bacon grease until
yellow. Or use any fatty pork meat: trimmings from a roast or chops,
"fat-back", etc

2)  I prefer Purple-Hull Peas over the Black-eyes, But if you don't
know the difference (or can't find them) it's not a big deal. It is
important to use fresh peas, frozen if you have to...if you can only
get canned or dried peas, nevermind and fix something else.

3)  I discovered a secret to Southern style cooking: Cavender's Greek
Seasoning.  Put a little of it in everything, along with the
Louisiana Hot Sauce makes everything taste better. This is what I
would do for the greens as a regular family dinner.  Later I'll get
out the company recipe.

BTW  Southern Living is *the* Soutern magazine and has the best
recipes for regional favorites.  They also put out an annual cookbook
which includes all the recipes for the year. If I keep osting them
here y'all see that this book is a very worthwhile purchase.

Hot Italian Sausage (2)

pork, italian

2 1/2 teaspoon coarse (kosher) salt
1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
6  dried hot red peppers
1  (each about 1-1/2 inches
1  long), seeds removed, or
2 teaspoon crushed dried red pepper
1  flakes
1 tablespoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon fennel seeds
1/2 teaspoon very finely minced garlic
1 3/4 pound lean, trimmed pork, cut
1  into 1-inch dice and
1  chilled
1/2 pound fresh pork fat, cut into
1  1/2-inch dice and chilled

1. Combine the salt, peppercorns, hot peppers, paprika, thyme, and
fennel in a spice mill or a mortar and grind to a coarse texture, not
a powder. Mix in a small bowl with the garlic. 2. Combine the meat,
fat, and spices in a large bowl. 3. Put half the mixture in the
container of a food processor and process to a medium-coarse grind
(if you are using a meat grinder, follow the directions on page 4,
using the medium disc). The meat and fat should be distinct from each
other, but reduced to pieces of about the same size; do not
overprocess. Scrape into a bowl. Repeat with the remaining
ingredients, then knead the batches together, cover the bowl, and
refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours. 4. Stuff the casings as indicated in
the general sausage-making instructions on pages 4-5, tying off the
links at 4 to 5 inches. If weather is cool, hang the sausages for a
few hours, until they are just dry to the touch. If it's too hot or
humid to hang the sausages, simply refrigerate them, uncovered, for a
minimum of 12 hours. Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, or
freeze for longer storage. TO COOK: Prick the sausages with a needle
and arrange in a single layer in a baking pan. Bake in a 425-degree
oven for 25 minutes, or until browned, tuning often. Or place the
pricked sausages in a large skillet and add 1/4 inch of water. Cook
over moderate heat, turning often, until the water has evaporated and

Hulled Corn Soup (Ai)

soups, vegetables, pork, side dish

4 quart dried indian corn kernels
3 pound salt pork
1 pound dry red kidney beans
1 quart hardwood ashes

Put enough water in an old kettle to cover the corn, Bring to a boil;
add corn and ashes. Cook about 20 minutes, stirring frequently. This
loosens the hulls or shells on the corn. When the hulls slip off the
kernels by working between the fingers, drain the water and rinse
corn in cold water, working corn with the fingers to help remove
hulls. Drain and parboil; drain, rinse and parboil again. Repeat
several times until the parboiled water looks clean and clear, (A
handmade basket is traditionally used for this purpose.)

When corn is good and clean, place it in a large kettle or canner with
clean water. Parboil washed beans separately until water is colored;
add both water and beans to the corn mixture. Cut salt pork into
small pieces; add to the corn and beans. Be sure to use plenty of
water because the corn will swell as it cooks. Cook 3 or 4 hours, or
until corn is tender, stirring occasionally and adding water as
needed. Makes 16 quarts of soup.

Hungarian Sausage

meats, pork, hungarian

3 pound pork butt, boneless - cut into larg; e pieces
1 pound beef chuck, cut into large pieces
1 pound pork fat, fresh - cut into large pi; eces
10  garlic cloves, peeled and crushed (; about 2 tbs)
1 cup water
2 tablespoon salt
1/2 tablespoon black pepper, freshly ground
3 tablespoon hungarian paprika
1 teaspoon saltpeter
1/4 teaspoon cloves, ground
1  sausage casing, 1 diameter - 10 fee; t

In a meat grinder, coarsely grind the pork, beef, and pork fat, in
batches. Add all remaining ingredients, except the casings. Mix well
and allow to sit while you clean the casings.
Rinse the casings thoroughly in cold water and run fresh water
through them. Drain.
Using a sausage machine, a KitchenAid with a sausage attatchment,
or a sausage funnel, fill the casings and tie them off into about 16"
lengths. Do not fill them too tightly as they must have room to
expand when they cook.
Hang the sausages in a home style smoker and smoke them for abour
1 hour. Do not allow the temperature of the smoker to go above 150 F.
Remove the sausages and hang over a stick or dowel. Put the stick
in a cool place and position an electric fan so that it will blow
directly on the sausages. Allow them to dry for 2 days. They are they
ready for use.
Place them in the refrigerator, where they will keep well for
about a week.

Huo Tip (Pot Stickers)

ham, chinese

2 1/2 cup flour *
1 cup water *
2 ounce cabbage (1/2 cup cooked and  choppe; d)
1/2 pound lean ground pork
1  green onion, chopped
1 teaspoon chopped ginger
1 tablespoon tientsin preserved vegetable  rinse; d and chopped
2 tablespoon oil
1 cup chicken stock
      ----SEASONING----
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon thin soy sauce
1 teaspoon oyster sauce
1 teaspoon white wine
1  dash of pepper
2 teaspoon cornstarch
      ----DIP----
2 teaspoon thin soy sauce
1 teaspoon hot spiced oil
1 teaspoon white vinegar

Combine flour and cold water in large mixing bowl. Mix thoroughly to
form dough.  Cover with damp cloth; let stand for 20 minutes. *

Cook cabbage 2 minutes in boiling water.  Rinse in cold water, and
drain. Squeeze dry of all excess moisture. Chop fine; set aside.

Place the ground pork, chopped green onion, chopped ginger, and
preserved vegetables together on chopping board. Mix and chop with
the clever for approximately
15    strokes.

Add "seasoning" and the cabbage to the pork mixture and mix
thoroughly.

After dough has set for 20 minutes, knead it for 1 minute and then
form into 2 to 3 rolls, approximately 1-1/2 inch in diameter. Cut
each roll of dough into slice 1-1/2 inch thick.

With a small rolling pin, or heel of hand, flatten each piece of
dough into a thin patty, 3 inch in diameter. Place 1/4 tablespoon of
the pork mixture in the center of each patty. Fold in half, and seal
the edges by pressing firmly together with your fingers. (Help
ready-made skins to seal by applying egg white to the edges.)

Set each pot sticker with the straight edge on a platter, pressing
firmly so as to form a flat base. Each pot sticker should be made to
stand upright, rather than allowed to rest flat on its side.

Heat frying pan and add 2 tablespoon oil.  On medium heat, pan-fry pot
stickers.  Cook on the base surface only. Pan-fry 2 minutes, until
the base side is nicely browned.

Add 1 cup chicken stock to the pot stickers.  Cover and cook over
medium heat for approximately 7 minutes, until most of the chicken
stock is absorbed.  Remove to platter.

Mix thin soy sauce, hot spiced oil, and white vinegar to use as
condiment for Pot Stickers.

* Pot sticker skins can be purchased at Chinese groceries.

J.Meyer Hungarian Gypy Bacon (Ciganyszalonna)

pork, hungary

1 x no ingredients

My father was born in Romania. His Grandfather taught him how to make
Gypsy Bacon over the campfire and he taught his children. I remember
sitting around the camp fire in the local Forest Preserve, holding a
stick with a chunk of smoked bacon over the coals. Potatos were
buried in the embers and opened cans of pork and beans were standing
on stones in the campfire. Someone was alway dropping their bacon on
the dirt or the grass. Pick it up and burn off the dirt. Eat it.
Delicious.

Regards, June Meyer. Prepare a smoked cured slab of bacon, with the
rind still attached, by scoring it in 1 inch square sections down to
the rind. Cut off a 3 by 3 inch secton for each person. Skewer it on
a long fork or stick and hold it over the fire until the bacon starts
to cook and sizzle and the rind shrinks and curls up the bacon
sections. Is your mouth watering yet? Sprinkle paprika over bacon,
eat by cutting off an inch cube with a knife and topping it with
chopped sweet onion and hearty rye bread. Serve with cold beer and
Schnapps chasers. The taste is wonderful, good on those cold nights
around the campfire.

This type of bacon can be bought at german or hungarian deli or meat
markets. The bacon is firm, not soft. It is cured in a way which
permits you to also eat it in thin slices on bread as an appetizer.

If you try one of my recipes please tell me what you think.

Jamaican-Style Spareribs

pork, jamaican

3  to 4-pound slab of pork spareribs
3/4 cup coarsely chopped onion
4  cloves garlic, quartered
2  to 4 fresh or canned jalapeno peppe; rs, seeded and chopped
2 tablespoon ground allspice
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
1 tablespoon salad oil
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon salt
1  about 12 fresh bay leaves *
1  lime-dressed avocado (recipe below)
1 large papaya [very optional, s.c.]

* Or dry bay leaves soaked in water for about 1 hour.

Grilling time: 1 to 1 1/4 hours

Made this for dinner Sunday.  Thought the ribs got a tad over done.
Next time I'll cut the cooking time by about fifteen minutes. The
recipe doesn't call this a "jerk" type dish, but the spices are
similar and the slashes in the meat are right up that alley.

Make 1/4-inch-deep slashes between ribs on both sides of spareribs
slab.

In a food processor or blender, combine onion, garlic, jalapeno
peppers, allspice, ginger, oil, nutmeg and salt. Whirl until pureed.
Rub spice puree over surface and into slashes on both sides of
spareribs slab. cover and let stand for 1 to 2 hours (or refrigerate
until next day).

Barbecue ribs by indirect heat.  Distribute bay leaves over meaty
sides of ribs; then place ribs, meat side up, on grill directly above
drip pan. Cover barbecue and adjust dampers as necessary to maintain
an even heat. Cook until ribs are well browned on outside and meat
near bone is no longer pink; cut to test (1 to 1 1/4 hours). Near end
of cooking time, prepare Lime-Dressed Avocado; also cut papaya into
wedges.

To serve, cut spareribs into 2- to 3-rib portions. Arrange on a large
platter with avocados and papayas. Makes 4 to 6 servings.

Makes 4 to 6 servings.

LIME-DRESSED AVOCADO:

In a small bowl, stir together 3 tablespoons each lime juice and
salad oil, 1 teaspoon sugar and 1/8 teaspoon each red pepper flakes
and oregano leaves.  Season to taste with salt.

Cut 3 large ripe avocados in half lengthwise; pit, but do not peel.
Pour equal amounts of lime dressing into each avocado cavity, making
sure all cut surfaces are coated.

Makes 6 servings.

Got this from a flier for a new cookbook, the Sunset "Ultimate Grill
Book".

Jane Grigson's English Brine

meats, pork, preserves, uk

7 pint water
1 1/2 pound sea or coarse salt
1 pound dark brown sugar
2 ounce saltpeter
1  bayleaf
1  sprig thyme
10  juniper berries; crushed
10  peppercorns; crushed

Boil hard for 5 minutes. Leave to cool. Clean crock or bucket and lid with
soda dissolved in boiling water, rinse well, and leave to DRAIN dry.
Pour in cold brine, though a muslin lined strainer. Immerse the meat
(duck, pork, beef, mutton) and keep it below the surface by laying a piece
of boiled wood, or scrupulously clean plate on top. Cover and keep in a dry
place at a temperature below 60øF
Salting time.
============ This depends on the thickness of the meat. Trotters, 24 hrs,
a leg of pork can take 10 days. NB. Joints required for roasting rather
than boiling will be improved by a 12 hour soak in brine, without tasting
too salty afterwards.

In home conditions, in a cool larder, meat can be kept in brine for up to a
fortnight or three weeks, sometimes longer. The moments islands of white
mould begin to float on the surface,  remove meat and throw away the brine.
The crock will need washing in boiling soda again. The meat will be OK.

1 small cucumber
1  peeled, seeded and diced
2 tablespoon rice vinegar
2 tablespoon olive oil
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1  jalapeno pepper -- seeded
1  and diced
1 tablespoon coarsely ground black
1  pepper
4 tablespoon fresh coriander -- finely

1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1  black beans -- rinsed and
1  pineapple chunks -- drained

Rub whole tenderloin with Jerk Seasoning.  Prepare a covered grill for
indirect cooking (or preheat oven to 450 degrees for conventional
cooking): Bank medium-hot coals (thickly covered with white ash) to
one side of grill and place meat on opposite side.  Place whole
tenderloin in grill in covered grill and cook 15 to 20 minutes or
until meat thermometer registers an internal temperature of 160
degrees. To cook in a conventional oven at 450 degrees, place roast
in an open pan and cook about 20 minutes or until internal
temperature reads 155 degrees on a meat thermometer. Allow roast to
stand 10 minutes before cutting.  In a large bowl toss together
beans, onion, chili powder and cumin. Heat a large skillet over
medium-high heat, film with a little oil and stir-fry the bean
mixture until heated through, about 3-4 minutes.  Toss bean mixture
with chopped fresh coriander, lime juice, and salt. Serve sliced
tenderloin with beans, warmed tortillas and salsa. Makes 4 servings.
~-Pineapple-Cucumber Salsa: In a medium bowl stir together drained
pineapple chunks, diced cucumber, rice vinegar, olive oil, cayenne
pepper, jalapeno pepper, black pepper and fresh coriander. Cover and
let rest at room temperature for an hour to let flavors mingle.
Refrigerate for longer storage.  Bring to room temperature before
serving. Makes 3 cups. ~-*Jerk Seasoning: Mix together dried minced
onion, onion powder, crushed thyme, salt, allspice, nutmeg cinnamon,
sugar, black pepper and cayenne. Makes enough to coat one whole
tenderloin. I usually quadruple this recipe and use it on ribs and
chicken before grilling. May 24,1995 Omaha World Herald

1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
3  slices chopped bacon
1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
1 teaspoon pepper (or to taste)
1/2 pound Italian sausage
1/4 cup wine (or to taste)
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 dash cinnamon (or to taste)
1 dash ground cloves (or to taste)
1  chopped onion
1  chopped green pepper
1  6 ounce can tomato paste
1  2.5# can ital tomatoes+juic
1  bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon basil
1  several cloves sliced garlic

Saute bacon and some onion in oil.  Then add beef, sausage, green
pepper and the rest of the onion.  Cook until meat is browned. Then
add mushrooms, tomatoes (with juice), bay leaf and seasonings. Simmer
for 1 hour. Add tomato paste and wine and simmer for another 30
minutes. If your sauce winds up being a little runny, add some more
tomato paste or let simmer uncovered till desired consistency is
achieved. I rarely make this recipe the same way twice.  It's a very
forgiving recipe and experimentation is reccommended.  Try adding a
dash of Worchestershire sauce and/or a dash of bitters.  Add some
oregano, whatever you like. This recipe also doubles very easily. The
amount of garlic was purposely vague as I'm one of those people who
feel that you can never have enough garlic. If you're not a
garlic-aholic, you probably will only need one clove of garlic. This
was given to me by my father Jerry Elliott. ~-  Hunter Elliott

1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

4 tablespoon Italian bread crumbs

1 can mushrooms
4 tablespoon butter
1/2 teaspoon onion powder

Saute mushrooms in 1/2 stick of butter. Mix ground beef with spices
thoroughly. Fashion into thin patties (1/4"); 5 inches in diameter as
they will shrink and get "thicker" after grilling. Grill until
desired doneness. Garnish with mushrooms, tomatoes, SHARP Cheddar
cheese and lettuce. Serve on an Onion roll. Purple onion slices are
optional for those who enjoy that sweet onion. Hamburgers tend to get
a little boring but this will change your mind about the traditional
burger. NOTE: This is not a "HOT" burger, so stay with the spices. It
is a little extra trouble with all the ingredients but it is relished
by my family. Hope yours enjoy it too. Joey Aguzin in New Awlins.

1/2 pound pork tenderloin, trimmed
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon minced garlic (3 cloves)
3 tablespoon jungle curry paste (recipe follows)
2 cup defatted chicken stock
1/2 pound chinese eggplant, coarsely chopped
1/2 pound long beans, trimmed, cut into i inc; h pieces
2 tablespoon fish sauce
1/4 cup thinly sliced fresh krachai or:
2 tablespoon loosely packed dried *
2  fresh kaffir lime leaves or:
4  dried **
1/2 cup chopped fresh basil

* soaked in warm water for 15 minutes, drained and sliced (optional)
** soaked in warm water for 20 minutes and drained, or I teaspoon. grated
lime zest

Unlike most other Thai curries, jungle Curry is made without coconut
milk because coconuts don't grow in the jungles of northern Thailand.
The curry paste is hot and full of flavor. Kaffir lime leaves give
this curry its distinctive and enticing flavor, but if they are not
available, you can substitute grated lime Zest.

Cut pork in half lengthwise and cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Set
aside. In a large, nonstick skillet or wok, heat oil over medium-high
heat. Add garlic and stir-fry for 2 minutes, or until browned. Add
curry paste and cook for 30 seconds, pressing it against the sides
and bottom of the skillet or wok. Add pork and stir-fry for 2 to 3
minutes, or until light brown.  Add stock and bring to a boil. Add
eggplant, beans, fish sauce, krachai (if using) and lime leaves or
zest, and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, or until the vegetables are
tender. If using lime leaves, discard them. Remove from heat and stir
in basil. Serve with sticky rice.

Serves 4 as a main dish or 6 in combination with other dishes.

Kaeng Paa Moo (Jungle Curry)

pork, ham

1  stephen ceideburg
1/2 pound pork tenderloin, trimmed
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon minced garlic (3 cloves)
3 tablespoon jungle curry paste (recipe follows)
2 cup defatted chicken stock
1/2 pound chinese eggplant, coarsely chopped
1/2 pound long beans, trimmed, cut into i inc; h pieces
2 tablespoon fish sauce
1/4 cup thinly sliced fresh krachai or:
2 tablespoon loosely packed dried *
2  fresh kaffir lime leaves or:
4  dried **
1/2 cup chopped fresh basil

* soaked in warm water for 15 minutes, drained and
sliced (optional) ** soaked in warm water for 20
minutes and drained, or I teaspoon. grated lime zest

Unlike most other Thai curries, jungle Curry is made
without coconut milk because coconuts don't grow in
the jungles of northern Thailand. The curry paste is
hot and full of flavor. Kaffir lime leaves give this
curry its distinctive and enticing flavor, but if they
are not available, you can substitute grated lime Zest.

Cut pork in half lengthwise and cut into
1/4-inch-thick slices. Set aside. In a large, nonstick
skillet or wok, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add
garlic and stir-fry for 2 minutes, or until browned.
Add curry paste and cook for 30 seconds, pressing it
against the sides and bottom of the skillet or wok.
Add pork and stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until
light brown.  Add stock and bring to a boil. Add
eggplant, beans, fish sauce, krachai (if using) and
lime leaves or zest, and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, or
until the vegetables are tender. If using lime leaves,
discard them. Remove from heat and stir in basil.
Serve with sticky rice.

Serves 4 as a main dish or 6 in combination with other
dishes.

Kang Cheud Tang-Ran Sodsai - Stuffed Zucchini

poultry, soups, pork, oriental

3  zucchini, medium size.
1 1/2 cup lean ground pork or chicken.
2  eggs, lightly beaten.
2 tablespoon fish sauce.
1  ground white peppers.
2 tablespoon cilantro, chopped.
6 cup chicken or pork stock.

Peel zucchini and cut into approximately 1-1/2"
lengths.  Make the lengths of zucchini into cups by
scooping out the seeds in the center, but leaving
small amount to form the bottom of the cup.  You may
need more or less zucchini than the amount given,
depending on their size. In a bowl, mix the ground
pork or chicken with fish sauce, eggs, ground white
peppers, and cilantro.  Fill the zucchini cups with
the mixture, and overfill slightly to make a small
mound.  Cook the filled zucchini cups by steaming for
about 1/2 hour. Bring the chicken or pork stock to a
boil, and season to taste.  Place the precooked
zucchini cups into a serving tureen, pour the boiling
stock over them, and serve.

Kathy Pitts' New Mexico Chili

chili, pork

1 x no ingredients

I don't have a real recipe for New Mexico-style chile,
although I do make it occasionally when I manage to
drag home more fresh Anaheim or Poblano chiles than I
can dispose of otherwise.  (Kroger's sometimes has BIG
bags of them for 99 cents a bag ;-)

What I do is first roast the chiles (either in the
broiler or -- better -- over charcoal).  The number of
chiles I use depends on the size/heat of the chiles,
and can range from 2-3 to 10 or more.  If the chiles
are really hot (it happens sometimes, even with
Anaheims), I'll also add 3-4 roasted green bell
peppers to give the dish the required pepper taste
without rendering it inedible by anyone without an
asbestos esophagus.

After the chiles have cooled a bit, I peel and seed
them, and cut them into coarse dice.  I sometimes (not
always) will also roast/peel 5-6 tomatoes to place in
the chiles, but tomatoes are optional in this dish,
and I usually don't use 'em.

Next, cut up 3-4 pounds of lean boneless pork (beef is
sometimes used, but isn't as good in this dish, IMHO,
and I would imagine lamb would be very good here
indeed).

Coat the meat in seasoned flour, and brown it in hot
lard.  Remove from the pan and set aside.  Toss a
couple of chopped onions into the pot, along with a
clove or two of garlic.  When the onions are golden, I
add enough flour to make a roux, and cook until the
roux is light brown.

I then add chicken broth to make a fairly thin gravy,
the pork, chiles, tomatoes (if used), and season the
dish with cumin and Mexican oregano.

Simmer for a couple of hours, until the pork is tender
and the flavors have blended.  The end dish should
have a pronounced green chile/pepper flavor and be the
consistancy of a thick stew.  It's very good by
itself, or as a filling for burritos/soft tacos, and
is wonderful reheated the next morning and served as a
side dish with scrambled eggs for breakfast. Wes, for
some bizarre reason, likes it over rice...

Sorry for the inexact recipe/directions.  I learned to
make this dish from an ex-neighbor who was or mixed
Hispanic/Native American ancestry, and never QUITE got
around to rendering her directions into a real recipe.
(She served the dish with fry bread, and a pot of
white beans on the side -- have no idea whether this
was traditional or simply the way she liked it.)

1 small carrot
6  dried chinese black  mushrooms, soa; ked
8 cup rich beef broth
3 ounce can bamboo shoots, drained
18  canned gingko nuts, drained
2 tablespoon pine nuts, optional
1  fresh red chili, shredded
3  green onions, shredded
      ----VINEGAR SOY DIPPING SAUCE----
3/4 cup light soy sauce
1/4 cup white vinegar
1/4 cup white sesame seeds, toasted  and gr; ound
2 teaspoon finely chopped green onions

This cook-at-the-table one-pot dish is served with a
biting vinegar soy sauce dip.  The meat and vegetables
are eaten first; then the stock, well flavored by the
ingredients and pepped up with chili, is served as a
soup with a sprinkling of diced onions.

Very thinly slice the liver, sprinkle with salt and
pepper and fry lightly in a little vegetable oil with
a few drops of sesame oil until colored and sealed on
the surface.  Set aside.

Boil the tripe for 8 minutes in lightly salted water;
drain and cut into narrow strips.

Cut the beef into thin slices.  Pound with a meat
mallet or the side of a cleaver and cut into small
squares.

Mix the ground meat with the egg, adding salt, pepper
and a few drops each of sesame oil and soy sauce.
Form small meatballs with wet hands.  Fry in a
half-and-half mixture of sesame and vegetable oils
until lightly browned.

Peel and slice the carrot.  Drain the mushrooms and
remove the stems. Bring the stock to the boil in a
suitable vessel in the center of the table. Add the
meat, vegetables and nuts and simmer gently for about
15 minutes. Spoon straight from the pot into small
bowls with the vinegar soy dip.

When the meat and vegetables have been eaten, add the
finely shredded chili and green onions to the
remaining stock and serve in soup bowls.

Vinegar Soy Dipping Sauce:  Mix all ingredients.  The
sauce keeps for several days in the refrigerator
without the green onions, one day with the green
onions added.

La Teresita's Cuban Sandwich

meats, pork, sandwich, cuban

1  mojo sauce
3 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon water
3 tablespoon olive oil
3 tablespoon chopped parsley
3/4 teaspoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
4  cuban or portuguese rolls,  cut in; half
8  slices virginia ham; (abt 4 oz)
16  slices roast pork (see note)  (abt; 12 oz)
8  slices genoa salami; (abt 4 oz)
4  slices swiss cheese; (abt 4 oz)

Put sauce ingredients in a jar. Cover and shake until blended. For
each sandwich: Drizzle 1 tablespoon sauce on bottom half of roll. Top
with 2 slices each ham, roast pork and salami, then 1 slice Swiss
cheese. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon sauce and cover with top of bun.

NOTE: To make Cuban-seasoned roast pork: Rub 1 teaspoon each minced
garlic, oregano and salt on a 1 3/4-pound boneless pork-loin roast.
Roast on rack in 450 F oven 60 minutes, or until meat thermometer
inserted in center reads 160 F. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing.

This hearty sandwich makes great use of leftover roast pork. We've
included a recipe for Cuban-Seasoned Roast Pork (see Note) in case
you don't have any leftovers ready to use for this recipe. You may
also be able to find roast pork in the deli section of your market.
The sandwich is dressed with a sauce for which only La Teresita's
owner knows the recipe. All he gave us to go on is that it's called
mojo, which is a combination of olive oil with any citrus juice, any
herb and any member of the lily family--garlic, onion or shallots,
for example. Here's what we came up with.

Lentils With Italian Sausage

meats, vegetables, pork, italian

1 pound dry lentils
1  cold water
2 pound fresh Italian sausage, sweet
1  or hot
1  about 3 cups homemade or
1  canned chicken broth
1/4 cup olive oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
1  rib celery, finely chopped
1  carrot, finely chopped
2  cloves garlic, finely minced
8  fresh sage leaves, chopped,
1  or 1 teaspoon. dried, rubbed sage
1  salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoon tomato paste, diluted in a
1  little water

Clean lentils well by soaking them briefly and changing the water at
least once.  Put them in a 2-1/2-quart saucepan, add cold water to
cover, and bring to a boil.  Lower heat to simmer and cook until not
quite done, about 45 minutes.

Meanwhile, pierce sausages in several places, and then put them in a
small saucepan.  Add enough chicken broth to cover, and place over
medium heat. Bring to a gentle boil, and simmer for about 40 minutes.
From time to time, skim off and discard foam and fat that rise to the
top. When sausages are done, remove the pot from the heat and let
them sit in the broth while you finish the lentils.

Warm the oil in a medium skillet, and saute' the onion, celery,
carrot, garlic and sage in the olive oil over medium heat until the
onion is translucent and the vegetables are done. Drain the lentils,
saving their liquid.  To the lentil pot, add the vegetables, season
with salt and pepper, and add tomato paste. Mix gently using a wooden
spoon. Add 3/4 cup of the broth in which you cooked the sausages.
Taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed.

To serve, slice the sausages and arrange them on a platter next to
the warm lentils.

Les Rilletes De Tours (Pork Spread)

pork

3/4 pound fresh pork fatback
1 tablespoon coarse salt
9/16 pound fresh, lean, boneless pork
2  plump cloves garlic, unpeeled
1  branch dried thyme
1  bay leaf
3  peppercorns
1 cup water

Makes about 1 pound.

1. Remove the rind from the fatback. Discard it or save it for another
purpose.

2. Work the salt into all surfaces of the meat. Place it in a
noncorrosive bowl, cover it, and refrigerate it overnight.

3. Next day, dry the meat by patting it with paper towels. Don't be at
pains to remove the salt. Cut both the fat and the lean meat into
small thin pieces about
2    inches by 1/4 inch.

4.    Preheat the oven to 300^F

5. Wrap the garlic, thyme, bay leaf and peppercorns in a piece of
cheesecloth and tie it up securely. Put this sachet at the bottom of
an ovenproof earthenware pot (you can use a beanpot with a lid) Put
the chopped meat in the pot and add the water. Seal the pot with a
piece of aluminum foil and press the lid down over the foil into the
lid groove of the pot.

6. Put the pot on the center rack of the oven and bake it for 3.1/2
hours. Turn off the oven, but leave the pot in there for another 1/2
hour.

7. Place a large, stout sieve over a bowl. Break the seal on the pot
and empty the contents into the sieve. Discard the sachet.

8. Break the bits of meat apart with your fingers. Then, working with
2 forks, pull the fibers apart. This operation is very essential for
genuine rilletes, which are not a paste. They are very finely
shredded pork and fat. (Don't make the mistake of putting the meat
into the food processor and making a fine pate of it.)

NOTE: You may eat the rilletes all at once if you like, but mix the
shredded meat with a little of the dripping in a ratio of 2 parts
shredded meat to 1 part dripping. You may also pack the rilletes into
jars or pots and pour the dripping over them. Make certain that the
dripping covers the rilletes at least 1/4 inch deep. Cover the tops
of the pots or jars with foil. They will keep for a month or so under
refrigeration. Make sure your pots are sterilized. An easy way to do
that is by washing them well and rinsing them out with a few drops of
Cognac. Be sure that the spread is at room temperature when you serve
it. If you try to eat it cold, you will be astonished how tasteless
and greasy it seems. When it is served at room temperature you get
the full benefit of the long cooking, and the faint, savory perfume
and taste of the garlic and herbs. The spread is at its best on
crusty, freshly baked French bread.

Lihamurekepiiras (Meat Loaf In Sour-Cream Pas

meats, finnish

      ----PASTRY----
2 1/4 cup flour
1 teaspoon salt
12 tablespoon unsalted butter; chilled and cut into 1/4-
1  egg
1/2 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon butter; soft
      ----MEAT FILLING----
4 tablespoon butter
1/4 pound fresh mushrooms; finely chopped to yield 3
1  meat*
1/3 cup onions; finely chopped
1/4 cup parsley; finely chopped
1 cup Cheddar or swiss cheese; grat
1/2 cup milk
1  egg mixed w/2 tb milk

* Use either 3 pounds finely ground meat (beef, pork, ham, lamb or
veal or a combination of any of these), or 4 cups cooked ground or
finely chopped meat

Prepare the pastry: Sift the flour and salt together into a large
chilled bowl. Drop the 1/4-inch bits of butter into the bowl. Working
quickly, use your fingertips to rub the flour and butter together
until they have the appearance of flakes of coarse meal. In a
separate bowl, mix together the egg and sour cream and stir into this
the flour-butter mixture, working with your fingers until you can
gather the dough into a soft, pliable ball. Wrap in wax paper and
refrigerate 1 hour. Cut the chilled dough in half and roll out each
half to rectangles of 6 by 14 inches each, setting aside any scraps.

Butter the bottom of a jelly-roll pan with 1 tablespoon of soft
butter. Lift 1 sheet of the pastry over the rolling pin and unroll it
into the pan, or drape the pastry over the rolling pin, lift it up
and unfold it into the pan.

Prepare the meat filling:

Melt the 4 tablespoons of butter in a 10- to 12-inch skillet. When
the foam subsides, add the chopped mushrooms and cook them over
moderate heat, stirring frequently, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until they
are lightly colored. If you are using ground raw meat, add it to the
skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, for another 8 to 10 minutes,
or until the meat loses its read color and any accumulated liquid in
the pan cooks completely away. Scrape the meat mixture from the
skillet (or the mushrooms and already cooked meat) into a large
mixing bowl and stir in the chopped onions, parsley, cheese and milk.
Now gather this meat mixture into a ball and place it in the center
of the dough in the pan. With you hands, pat the meat into a narrow
loaf extending across the center of the dough from one end to the
other. Lift the second sheet of pastry over the pin and gently drape
it on top of the meat loaf; press the edges of the 2 sheets together.
Dip a pastry brush into the combined egg and milk mixture and moisten
the edges of the dough. Press down on the edges all around the loaf
with the back of a fork (the tines will seal the edges securely).
Prick the top of the loaf in several places with a fork to allow
steam to escape.

Preheat the oven to 375'F. Gather together into a ball all of the
excess scraps of dough and roll it out to a thin rectangle. With a
pastry wheel or small, sharp knife, cut this dough into long, narrow
strips. Brush the loaf with more of the egg and milk mixture and
crisscross the pastry strips over the top of the loaf in an
attractive pattern. Now brush the strips with the milk and egg
mixture and set the jelly-roll pan in the center of the oven. Bake
for 45 minutes, or until the loaf has turned a golden brown. Serve
thick slices of the hot meat loaf, accompanied by a bowl of cold sour
cream and a side dish of lingonberries.

Lion's Head Pork

meats, pork, oriental, wok

2 cup pork
6  water chestnuts
2 slice onion (thick slices)
1  salt
1  pepper
2 tablespoon soya sauce
3 tablespoon oil
1 1/2 pound coarsely shredded celery cabbage (a; bout 4-5 cups)

1. Take your Chinese cleaver and coarsely dice pork. Dice water
chestnuts and slices of onion. Place all together on a heavy duty
meatboard. Mince with your Chinese cleaver until all three of the
ingredients are blended together into a lump. (It takes 10-15 minutes
of solid mincing to accomplish this.)

2. Place minced meat into a bowl. Add salt, pepper, and soya sauce.
Blend together and form into 4 large meatballs.

3. Place oil in wok. Heat should be on medium. Heat oil for about 1
minute. Add pork balls to wok and brown slowly on all sides, about 15
minutes. Cover wok, reduce heat to low medium and cook pork balls a
further 30 minutes, lifting cover up from wok from time to time to
turn meatballs, so that they can be cooked through evenly.

4. Lift meatballs from wok and reserve on platter. Add celery cabbage
to wok. There should be some meat juice in the wok, about 1/2 cup or
so. If there isn't any, add 1/4 cup water to celery cabbage. Stir fry
about a minute, cover and cook a further 3 minutes, lifting cover
once or twice to stir cabbage. Place cooked celery cabbage on serving
platter. Arrange meatballs over cabbage.

NOTE: Celery cabbage is a winter season vegetable. If it is not
available in summer, regular cabbage can be substituted. Increase the
cooking time of the regular cabbage to 7 1/2 minutes.

Lithuanian Koseliena Saltiena (Jellied Pig's Feet)

meats, pork, european

3 pound pigs feet (cut in half,

1  water
1 tablespoon salt
18  black peppercorns
2  ribs of celery, including
1  leaves, cut into large
1  chunks
1 medium yellow onion, peeled
1  carrot, scrubbed and cut
1  into about 4 pieces

Singe the feet by holding over a gas flame. Then was, place in a stock pot
and bring to a boil. Boil for about three minutes. Then pour off the water.
Add fresh water, salt, and 9 to 12 peppercorns, celery, onion and carrots
and return to boil. Simmer slowly for about two hours, until meat starts to
become tender. Remove from heat. Discard vegetables and pepper corns. Allow
to cool until fat congeals at top. Skim off fat layer. Add Take out meat
and vegetables and allow cooling liquid to cool so you can skim fat.

Add six fresh black pepper corns and return to boiling. Reduce heat and
simmer for another two to three hours, until bones are falling apart. Let
cool and skim fat. Then pour into soup dishes -- about 1 1/2 inches deep,
making sure feet are covered with liquid -- and refrigerate overnight
covered with plastic wrap or foil.

(If you choose you may separate meat and bones once the pigs feet are cool
enough to handle, then pour meat and liquid into bowls and refrigerate.
Deboning, however, is not necessary -- and not really traditional.) Serve
with fresh baked rye bread, and whipped unsalted butter (for those who want
it.)

Lou Pastis En Pott (Potted Meat)

pork, beef, french

1/2 pound lard
2 pound lean beef

3  bay leaves
1  a few sprigs of thyme and rosemary
1 teaspoon juniper berries
1  salt and pepper
1/2  bottle red wine (the near-black win; e of cabors or a

This is an unusual potted meat prepared only in the Languedoc.

Serves 8 - 10

Time:  Start at least 2 weeks ahead; 30 minutes plus 2 hours cooking,
repeated 3 times

First cooking: deep red Medoc)

Second and third cooking: the same ingredients again each time

You will need a large straight-sided earthenware pot. Scald the
earthenware pot and grease it thoroughly with a little of the lard
(you can line the bottom with a few fig or walnut leaves if you have
them). Cut the beef and pork into slices, trimming the gristle and
sinews as you do so. Put the bay leaves on the bottom of the pot. Lay
in the meat slices, zseasoning with the herbs, salt, and freshly
ground pepper as you do so. Pour in the wine - it should just cover
the meat.

Simmer the pot uncovered over a very low heat or in a preheated 250 F
oven, for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until the volume is reduced by half.
Allow to cool. Seal with a layer of lard, melted and poured over the
cool meat. Cover with wax paper tied down with string.  Leave the pot
on a refrigerator shelf for a week.  Then remove the lard seal and
add in another 2 pounds pork and 2 pounds beef, the whole covered with
wine, seasoned and cooked as before. Repeat the operation at the end
of another week. You will now have a delicious dark jelly- meat which
you can either eat hot or cold. If you continue to replace the volume
you have removed, the pot can go on forever.

Sift the flour into a bowl. In another bowl, mix the salt with the
water. Add 1 cup of salted water to the flour to make a stiff dough.
Beat the dough hard against the sides of the mixing bowl to soften
and make it elastic. Add more of the water to soften the dough.

elastic and has a consistency of heavy cream. Use only enough water
to achieve this consistency. Heat a frying pan greased with pork fat
and pour in about 2 tablespoons of the thin batter, tilting the pan
to spread the batter as thin as possible. Turn the wrapper when it
can be freed from the frying pan And fry quickly on the other side.
Remove from pan. Do the same with the rest of the batter.

Luther's Barbecued Ribs

5 pound spareribs
      ----FLORIDA BARBECUE SAUCE----
2 cup margarine or butter
1 cup cider vinegar
1 cup catsup
6 ounce jar prepared horseradish
6  limes or lemons (the juice)
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce

PREPARE FLORIDA BARBECUE SAUCE: In a medium stainless-steel or
enamelware saucepan melt margarine or butter slowly. Add vinegar,
catsup, horseradish, lime or lemon juice, salt and Worcestershire and
pepper sauces. Simmer uncovered 20 to 25 minutes to blend flavors.
Use as basting sauce for pork, chicken or other meats and serve as a
table sauce. Leftover sauce can be refrigerated and kept up to a
week. NOTE: If using this sauce for chicken, lemons are better than
limes; limes give a pleasant tang to pork and other meats.
DIRECTIONS: Place ribs about 6 inches above hot coals. Brush lightly
with sauce and brown on one side. Keep a water bottle handy when
using this sauce as it causes flames to shoot up. Turn, brush again
with sauce, and brown the other side.  Continue turning and basting
every 10 minutes until ribs are done, about 1 hour. Check by cutting
near bone in a center section.  If juices run clear or golden the
ribs are done. Remove ribs to a platter. Cut into 1- to 3-rib
sections and serve with any remaining sauce.

1 1/2 cup maple syrup
1 teaspoon ginger
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon allspice

covering.
Score ham. Combine syrup, ginger, nutmeg and allspice. Place ham in a
large dish and baste with syrup mixture. Let the ham stand in syrup
for 1 to 2 hours or until it reaches room temperature; baste
frequently with syrup. When ready to smoke, remove ham from dish,
stud with cloves and place on smoker grid. Baste with syrup at least
twice while smoking. Before last hour of smoking, decorate with
canned pineapple slices and cherries, baste again.  If using a meat
thermometer, fully cooked ham should reach an internal temperature of
130-140 degrees. Make certain the thermometer is not touching the
bone. CHARCOAL: Use 7-8 pounds. charcoal, 3 quarts hot water, 3-4 wood
sticks and smoke 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours. ELECTRIC: Use 3 quarts hot
water, 3-4 wood sticks, and smoke 2-3 hours. GAS: Use 4 quarts hot
water, 3-4 wood sticks, and smoke 2-3 hours. Formatted for Compu-Chef

Masa Biscuits With Ham & Green Chile Gravy

mexican, sauces, ham

5  long green chiles (anaheims)
6 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 pound firm, smoky ham, trimmed, cut into; 1/4 cubes
1/4 cup unbleached a-p flour
5 cup milk, 2% ok
1/2 teaspoon salt
8  freshly baked masa biscuits, (recip; e), split

In the open flame of a gas burner or under a pre-heated broiler,
roast the long green chiles, turning them, until they are lightly but
evenly charred. Steam the chiles in a paper bag, or in a bowl,
covered with a plate, until cool.  Rub away the burned peel. Stem and
seed the chiles and coarsely chop them.  There should be about 3/4
cup.

In a large skillet over medium-low heat, melt the butter. Add the ham
cubes and cook them, stirring constantly, until lightly browned,
about 10 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the ham cubes and cook,
stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.  Slowly whisk the milk into the
ham mixture. Stir in the green chiles and salt. Raise the heat to
medium and bring the milk mixture to a simmer. Cook, stirring
occasionally and scraping the bottom of the pan, until thickened into
a medium gravy, about 7 minutes. Adjust the seasoning.

Arrange the biscuits, split-sides up, on 8 plates. Spoon the gravy
over and around the, using it all. Serve immediately.

NOTE:  I tend to add a bit more "heat" by adding some fresh jalepeno,
cut into very fine julienne as garnish to each person's serving.
Looks pretty, too.  This is also a good dish to make using smoked
turkey (thigh) instead of ham.

Maultaschen (Swabian Pockets)

pork, german

      ----DOUGH----
2 3/4 cup flour
4  egg
1  salt
      ----FILLING----
1 tablespoon butter
6  bacon slice; cut into cubes
3  onion, medium; diced
1/4 pound sausage, Italian sweet
1  hard roll, without crust, an
1/2 pound spinach; cooked
1/2 pound ground meat
1 cup farmer's sausage; diced
3  egg
3 tablespoon parsley, fresh; chopped
1  salt; to taste
1  pepper, black; to taste
1  nutmeg; grated
1  egg
3 tablespoon milk, canned
1  stock, beef

Combine the flour, eggs, and salt in a bowl and mix to make a pasta
dough. Then add a little water and knead until it has a firm but
elastic consistency.

To make the filling, melt the butter in a skillet and fry the bacon
with the onions until both are quite translucent. Combine the bacon
mixture with the sausage meat.

Moisten the hard roll in water, press dry, and put through the meat
grinder (better than the food mill or food processor), along with the
bacon mixture, cooked spinach, ground meat or smoked farm sausage,
leftover roast, etc.  Then fold in the eggs, parsley, and seasonings;
mix together. The filling should be very spicy indeed.

On a board that has been sprinkled with flour, roll out the dough into
rectangular sheets (about twice as wide as you want your
'Maultaschen' to be).  Take a tablespoon measure and put little dabs
of filling at equally spaced 3-inch intervals all down the middle of
one side of the sheet of dough.  Mix together the egg and canned milk
and apply it to the spaces in between, the outer edge and the fold
line. Fold the plain half of the sheet of dough over to cover the
filling, press down firmly on the spaces around the little packets of
filling, and use a pastry wheel or knife to separate the packets into
3-inch square or diamond- shaped 'Maultaschen'. The process is
similar to making ravioli. Cook thoroughly in beef stock or boiling
salted water for about 10 to 15 minutes, dpeending upon the size of
the 'Maultaschen'.  They'll bob up to the surface when they're done;
remove them with a slotted spoon and allow to drain.

Serving suggestions:

Cut an onion or two into half-rings, fry in butter until golden brown
amd empty the contents of the skillet over the 'Maultaschen' on the
serving dish. Serve with slippery potato salad or a mixed green
salad. Certainly if anyone were to insist that 'Maultaschen' were the
most delicious of all Swabian specialties, I[=Horst Scharfenberg]
would hardly be prepared to deny it.  In fact, as indicated earlier,
I suspect that 'Maultaschen' would have very good chances in a
four-way interna- tional competition with ravioli, won tons, and
pirogi for the champion- ship of the Roughly Rectangular Pasta with
Meat (plus Miscellaneous) Filling division.

It has been said that 'Maultaschen' were originally invented in order
to allow Swabians to keep eating meat during Lent by concealing it
beneath the pasta shell and amidst the spinach filling from the eye
of the parish priest (if not the omniscient Deity Himself). The
following recipe is typical but far from definitive, especially where
the ingre- dients for the filling are concerned.  Feel free to use
whatever you have on hand or whatever your fancy (or your conscience)
dictates.

Meat Dumplings Poached Or Pot-Sticker Style

pork, chinese, beef

1 pound ground or very finely chopped pork; or beef or 1/2 & 1/2
1  or 1/2 pork and 1/2 raw shrimp
1  marinade:
6 tablespoon sesame oil
2 teaspoon sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 pound cabbage (napa or chinese, preferred; ) or mix with bok choy,
1  celery, carrot, etc.
1 teaspoon salt
1/3 pound chopped green onions (use whole oni; on w/o roots)
1  skin:
3 cup flour
3/4 cup cold water
1/2 cup flour to prevent sticking during kn; eading.
10 cup boiling liquid (water or stock opti; onal)

Filling: Chop the "meat" well and mix well with the marinade.

Then chop the cabbage or veggie(s) fine and mix with 1 teaspoon salt and
let sit for 10 minutes; Squeeze out the excess water. Mix the veggie
with the meat and green onions and mix well by hand.

Skins: In a bowl, add water to the flour and knead into a smooth
dough; let it stand for ten minutes. Then roll the dough into a long
baton-like roll and cut into 50 pieces. (I just divide in 1/2 and 1/2 and
1/2 etc and am satisfied with four dozen. At the end I can eyeball 3
equal parts pretty accurately.)

Use a rolling pin to roll each piece into a thin circle.

Place 1 portion (50 th or 48th) of filling in the center of a dough
circle. Fold the circle in half and moisten the edges with water. Use
index finger and thumb to bring the sides together.

Pleat the open edge together (into a semi-circle - sorta) keeping the
other edge smooth. The smooth edge will yield to the length of the
pleated edge. Pinch the pleats together to seal. Repeat for all
dumplings.

Boil 10 cups water or stock or mixture and add dumplings; stir to
prevent from sticking together. Return to a boil, turn heat low and
cook for six minutes. Remove. Serve with dipping sauces.

I like to give each diner a small dipping bowl and provide Soy, Shao
Hsing, Rice Vinegar, Sesame Oil, Hot Sesame oil, Finely chopped or
grated Garlic, Ginger, Bean paste, Hot bean paste, Black Bean paste,
Peanut paste as makings for each to mix their dip to their liking.

YOU CAN CHEAT and buy ready made "gyoza" skins at most Chinese
markets. If you are not too dexterous, get a dumpling press and you
can stuff, fold, pleat, etc rapidly. Get more presses if you've a
helper or two. Mine were under $2.00 if I remember. These are the
same as you use for pierogi, etc.

You can freeze these but wrap with separate partitions (I was
successful rolling them in saran. I'd wrap one, roll, wrap one, roll,
etc. When frozen and then cooked, as liquid returns to boil, lower
and poach for 10 minutes. If they are going to be pot- stickers (next
recipe) you can also steam them or poach in low liquid without
covering.

3 tablespoon flour
2 1/2 cup brown stock, heated
1 small bouquet garni*
1 teaspoon tomato paste
1 pinch each salt
2 tablespoon small capers
2 tablespoon minced parsley
1  freshly ground black pepper
      ----MUSTARD BUTTER----
4 tablespoon sweet butter, softened
2 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 pinch english dry mustard
1 teaspoon lemon juice
      ----PORK----
2 tablespoon sweet butter
2 tablespoon cooking oil
16  up to ...
20  filet-of-pork medallions, cut 3/4 t; hick -or-
12  boned loin-of-pork medallions, 1/2; thick
1  salt
1  freshly ground white pepper
2 tablespoon finely minced shallots
1  garlic clove, finely minced
1 teaspoon meat glaze
1/2 cup dry white wine
      ----OPTIONAL----
1  beurre manie**
      ----GARNISH----
1  small glazed turnips
1  potato balls

* BOUQUET GARNI - In a piece of cheesecloth, tie the following: 3 to 4
sprigs of parsley, 1 bay leaf, 1/2 celery stalk with leaves, 1/2 teaspoon
dry
thyme.  Leave the string long enough to hang the garni in the pot and
tie the string to the pot handle for easy removal. ** Beurre Manie is
used to thicken sauces.  Combine 1 tablespoon flour and 1 tablespoon sweet
butter on a
small flat plate and blend the mixture with a fork into a very smooth
paste. Roll the paste into a ball. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
Butter a large flameproof baking dish and set aside. Start by making
the sauce. In a heavy saucepan melt the clarified butter.  Add the
minced vegetables and cook them over low heat for 5 to 8 minutes or
until they are very soft but not browned. Add the flour and stir it
until it is well blended with the vegetables.  Raise the heat a
little and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture becomes a
hazelnut brown. Do not burn or scorch the bottom of the saucepan.  As
soon as the flour mixture has turned nutty brown, add the hot brown
stock all at once and stir until the mixture is smooth and lightly
thickened. Add the Bouquet Garni, tomato paste, salt and pepper. Do
not oversalt as the sauce will become saltier as it reduces.
Partially cover the pan and simmer for 1 hour, stirring it from time
to time. Strain the sauce and reserve. While the sauce is cooking,
make the mustard butter. In a small bowl place the softened butter.
Add the Dijon and dry mustard and blend the mixture well with a
wooden spoon. Add the lemon juice and chill. THE PORK - In a large
skillet melt the 2 tablespoon of butter and oil. Season the pork medallions
with salt and white pepper. When the butter and oil are very hot, add
the pork medallions, a few at a time, and brown them on both sides.
As the medallions brown, remove them from the pan and set them aside.
Add the shallots and garlic to the pan and cook them over low heat
until they are soft but not browned. Add the meat glaze and the wine.
Bring it to a boil and scrape the bottom of the pan well. Reduce the
wine to 2 tablespoon. Add the strained sauce and bring it to a boil. Place
the
pork medallions in the buttered baking dish and pour the sauce over
them. Cover the dish with foil and set it in the oven. Braise the
pork for 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the baking dish from the oven to
the top of the stove. With a slotted spoon remove the pork to a
serving platter. Raise the heat and reduce the sauce slightly,
skimming off the fat. If it does not coat the spoon heavily, beat in
the Beurre Manie, bit by bit, until the sauce reaches the right
consistency. Add the minced capers and parsley and heat through.
Remove the sauce from the heat and whisk in the Mustard Butter little
by little until it is well incorporated into the sauce. Correct the
seasoning, adding a good dash of black pepper. Spoon the sauce over
the medallions and serve garnished with tiny glazed turnip and potato
balls.

Mee Krob (Crisp-Fried Noodles)

pasta, pork, chicken, seafood

1  stephen ceideburg
2 tablespoon fish sauce
2 tablespoon dark soy sauce
2  limes, juice only
3 tablespoon vinegar
1/4 cup brown sugar or half brown and half; palm sugar
1  oil, for deep-frying
6 ounce rice sticks
4  eggs, lightly beaten
1 medium onion, finely diced
3  cloves garlic, minced
1 small red or green chile, seeds removed,; finely minced
3/4 pound minced pork, diced chicken, or peel; ed shrimp, or a mixture
2  green onions, sliced, for garnish

This special occasion noodle dish is a favorite in many Thai
restaurants. Some versions are extremely sweet and sticky; this
version is less so, but the important flavors are still sweet, sour,
and salty in that order. Be sure to use a large enough pan for
saucing the noodles (step 5); a 14-inch wok is ideal.

1. In a small bowl, combine fish sauce, soy sauce, lime juice,
vinegar, and sugar and set aside.

2. In a wok or deep skillet, heat oil to 350 degrees F. Drop
approximately an ounce of rice sticks into the oil; they will puff up
and rise to the top of the oil in only a few seconds. Turn them over
once and fry until crisp, about 15 seconds in all. Transfer finished
noodles to a pan lined with paper towels and continue frying the
batter in small batches. Keep noodles warm in a low oven.

3. Dip a hand in the beaten egg and, holding your hand approximately 8
inches above the hot oil, drizzle egg over the surface in a random
pattern. Continue with about half the egg mixture, forming a lacy
network of egg. Fry until golden brown on underside, turn over once,
and brown other side. Transfer to a plate and drain on paper towels.
Repeat with remaining egg.

4. Heat a second wok over medium high heat and add approximately 2
tablespoons oil from the first wok. Add onion, garlic, and chile and
cook until they are fragrant. Add meats or shrimp and stir-fry just
until done.

5. Stir sugar mixture and add to wok. Bring to a boil and cook until
slightly thickened. Reduce heat to low and add about a quarter of the
fried noodles and eggs. Stir together and toss to break up noodle
clumps and coat with sauce. Continue adding noodles and eggs in
batches until all are coated with sauce. Transfer to serving platter
and garnish with sliced green onion.

Serves 4 with other dishes.

liquid. NOTE: Chili was no good! We mixed it with dry dog food and
gave it to the dogs. The meat must be browned before it is put in the

Mock Fish (Pork)

pork, chinese

3/4 pound pork
2 teaspoon wine
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1  level tablespoon corn flour (cornst; arch)
1  oil for deep-frying
4 teaspoon brown bean sauce
1 tablespoon water
1 tablespoon vinegar
1  level teaspoon sugar
1/2  level teaspoon red pepper, crushed
1 teaspoon pressed ginger juice
1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
1/2  level teaspoon corn flour mixed wit; h 4 tablespoons water

This dish is Szechwanese in origin.

"The annual run of the shad upstream stopped east of Szechwan, where
they spawned in lakes as large as small seas. Farther upstream, the
waters became more turbulent. The rapids cut through gorges, making
navigations upstream laborious, and the waters tan too swiftly to
make lakes where fish could be raised. This may be the reason for a
peculiar dish of pork known as Mock Fish, an attempt to reproduce the
taste of a well-sauced fish. It you close your eyes you can almost
believe it. The contrariness of Szechwan cooking lies in the fact
that veal or beef may be substituted in the recipe below with little
change in its taste. The taste of th original substances is all but
lost in the sauce. No one seems to mind, because the use of
seasonings is extraordinary.

Sliver the pork very finely, and marinate it for 2 to 3 hours in a
mixture of wine, soy sauce and corn flour. Deep-fry the slivers for
about 2 minutes, until well browned. Set them aside to drain. In a
bowl, mix together all the remaining ingredients except the corn
flour and water mixture.  Saute the pork in the bean sauce mixture
for a few minutes in a deep frying pan, until heated through.  Then
thicken the sauce with the corn flour flour and water, stirring
gently to make it smooth.

Mole Poblano De Dos Chiles

mexican, poultry, pork, chocolate

6  mulato chiles
6  pasilla chiles
8 pound turkey, in pieces
1 pound pork loin, in 2 chunks
4 tablespoon lard
1/2 cup almonds
1/2 cup peanuts
1  tortilla, coarsely chopped
4 tablespoon sesame seeds
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon anise
1 pound tomatoes, seeded, chopped
1 ounce unsweetened chocolate
1  salt
1  freshly ground pepper
1 teaspoon sugar

Prepare the chiles as described above in the recipe for Mole Poblano
Picante. Place the turkey and pork in a large kettle with enough
salted water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook, covered, for 1
hour. Drain, reserving the stock. Dry the turkey and pork pieces
thoroughly with paper towels. Heat the lard in a large, heavy
skillet. Brown the turkey and pork pieces, a few at a time; then
transfer to a flameproof casserole. In the electric blender, blend
the almonds, peanuts, tortilla, 2 tbs of the sesame seeds, cloves,
cinnamon, anise, tomatoes, and the prepared chiles, and reduce to a
coarse puree.

Heat the lard remaining in the skillet, adding a little more if
necessary, and cook the mixture for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.
Add 2 cups of the reserved stock, the chocolate, salt and pepper to
taste, and sugar. Stir until chocolate has melted. Pour the sauce
over the turkey and pork in the casserole; cover; and cook over very
low heat for about 1 hour, taking care not to let it burn. Sauce
should be the consistency of heavy cream, so, if necessary, thin with
more stock. Sprinkle with remaining sesame seeds just before serving.

Mom's Peppered Ham

meats

1  ham shank
1  peppercorns, whole
1  water

Place raw ham shank in big pot of water.  Heat to boiling, reduce and
simmer until done, about one hour (consult cooking chart per weight).
Cool. De-skin, remove fat and bone. In the process, you will cut off
some of the lesser-quality meat; will have 2-4 chunks of meat.

(Save scraps and strain fat off top of water; the meat and pot liquor
is great for cooking black beans.)

Put whole peppercorns and water in blender; grind until pureed, till
you have about 1/4 cup.  Coat all sides of the ham chunks (not ends).
Put in 300 - 325 degree oven to dry. Chill and slice as thinly as
possible.

Yield: 1 ham

1 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch

TO ASSEMBLE: 30 dumpling or gyoza skins Sesame oil for coating
steamer 1/2 cup minced scallion greens

Lightly chop the ground pork until fluffy.  Place in a mixing bowl
and add the remaining filling ingredients. Stir vigorously in one
direction with your hand or a wooden spoon to blend the ingredients
evenly.

Place a heaping tablespoon of the filling in the middle of a dumpling
skin and gather the edges of the skin around the filling. Holding the
dumpling between your index finger and thumb, squeeze it in the
center to form a "waist".  Push the filling up from the bottom to
create a flat surface. Smooth the top surface with the bottom of a
spoon dipped in water.

Line steamer trays with damp cheesecloth or parchment paper that has
been brushed with sesame oil (if steamer trays are not available,
lightly brush several aluminum pie plates with sesame oil). Arrange
the shaped dumplings about 1/4-inch apart in the steamers or on the
plates.

Fill a wok or a spaghetti pot water level with the bottom edge of the
steamer tray and heat until boiling. Stack the steamer trays one on
top of the other, cover and place over the boiling water.
Alternatively, you may fit the pie plates in the spaghetti pot and
cover with the lid. Steam the dumplings for about 15 minutes over
high heat, reversing the stacked trays after 8 minutes.  Remove the
cooked dumplings and continue steaming the dumplings as necessary.
Sprinkle the finished dumplings with the minced scallion greens and
serve with dipping sauces.
