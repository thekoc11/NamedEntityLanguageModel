      Title: MOCHA BUTTERCREAM
 Categories: Cakes, Toppings
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Instant coffee powder
      2 ts Water
      8 tb (1 stick) unsalted butter at
           -room temperature
    1/4 c  Confectioners sugar
    3/4 c  Plus 2 Tablespoons heavy
           -(whipping) cream, chilled
 
  Flavored lightly with coffee, this variation on Rosie's Buttercream
  has a lovely cafe au lait color.
  
  1. Dissolve the coffee in the water.
  
  2. Place all ingredients in a food processor and process until light
  and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Stop the machine several times to scrape
  down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.
  
  3. Transfer the buttercream to a medium sized mixing bowl and, using
  the paddle attachment of an electric mixer, continue to beat on
  medium-high speed, until the buttercream is white and fluffy, 15 to
  20 minutes. Stop the mixer to scrape the bowl several times with a
  rubber spatula (If you do not have a paddle attachment, you can use
  the whisk) Use the buttercream for frosting within an hour or it will
  need rewhipping.
  
  Makes 2 to 2.1/4 cups, enough to fill and frost a two- or four-layer
  cake

  Servings:  6
  
  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 325F. Place six 1/2 cup
  ramekins or custard cups in baking pan. Stir 2/3 cup sugar and 3
  tablespoons water in heavy small saucepan over low heat until sugar
  dissolves.  Wash down sugar crystals from sides of pan with brush
  dipped in cold water.  Increase heat to medium-high and bring mixture
  to boil. Boil without stirring until mixture turns deep golden brown,
  swirling pan occasionally, about 9 minutes. Immediately divide
  caramel among ramekins. Carefully tilt ramekins to coat bottoms (not
  sides) with caramel.
  
  Bring cream, milk and 1/4 cup sugar to boil in heavy medium saucepan,
  whisking until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat. Add chocolate and
  stir until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth. Whisk in instant
  coffee, yolks and egg.
  
  Divide custard mixture evenly among caramel-lined ramekins. Add
  enough hot water to baking pan to come halfway up sides of ramekins.
  Bake until custards are set around edges and centers move only
  slightly when baking pan is shaken, about 30 minutes.
  
  Remove custards from water and cool completely. Refrigerate until very
  cold, about 4 hours.  (Custards can be prepared 1 day ahead.)
  
  FOR GANACHE:
  
  Dissolve instant coffee in 1/2 teaspoon water in small bowl. Combine
  chocolate and cream in heavy small saucepan. Stir over low heat until
  chocolate melts and mixture is smooth. Remove from heat and stir in
  coffee mixture.  Cool until just warm to touch.
  
  Divide ganache among custards.  Spread ganache with back of spoon to
  cover top of custards completely. Refrigerate until ganache is set,
  at least 30 minutes. (Can be prepared 3 days ahead; cover.)
  
  Run small sharp knife around edge of custards to loosen. Invert
  custards onto plates and serve.

  Scrape the chilled custard into an ice cream maker and freeze
  according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pack the ice cream into
  a covered container and freeze for at least 2 or 3 hours, or
  overnight.
  
  Make the mocha chip ice cream: In a medium saucepan, combine the
  cream, half-and-half and espresso beans. Bring to a gentle boil, and
  remove from the heat. Place the cocoa powder in a small bowl. Add 2
  to 3 tablespoons of the hot cream mixture to the cocoa and stir well
  until a smooth paste forms. Return the cocoa powder mixture to the
  saucepan and whisk until smooth. Cover and allow toinfuse for 30
  minutes.
  
  In a medium bowl, using a wire whisk, stir the yolks, sugar and salt
  until blended.
  
  Strain the cream mixture through a fine-meshed strainer into a heavy
  medium saucepan. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat. Remove the
  pan from the heat. Gradually whisk about1 cup of the hot cream
  mixture into the beaten egg yolks until blended. Return this mixture
  to the saucepan. Continue cooking over medium-low heat, stirring
  constantly with a wooden spoon, for 3 to 5 minutes, until the custard
  has thickened slightly. Do not allow the custard to boil. It is done
  when you can run your finger down the back of the coated spoon and
  the path remains in the custard.
  
  Immediately remove the pan from the heat and strain the custard
  through a fine-meshed strainer into a stainless steel bowl. Place the
  bowl over a larger bowl of ice water and stir the custard for 5 to 10
  minutes, or until cool. Remove the bowl from the ice water and stir
  in the vanilla. Cover the surface of the custard with plastic wrap
  and refrigerate for 2 hours, or until very cold.
  
  Scrape the chilled custard into an ice cream maker and freeze
  according to the manufacturer's instructions. Just before the ice
  cream is ready, add the chocolate and process until evenly
  distributed throughout the ice cream. Pack the ice cream into a
  covered container and freeze for at least 2 or 3 hours, or overnight.
  
  Make the mocha sauce:
  
  Combine the chocolate and espresso powder in a medium bowl. In a small
  saucepan, combine the cream, sugar, and butter. Cook over medium-low
  heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the sugar has dissolved and
  the mixture comes to a gentle boil. Pour the cream mixture over the
  chocolate. Let stand for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. (The sauce
  can be prepared up to 2 days ahead and kept refrigerated. Rewarm in
  the top of a double boiler over hot, not simmering, water -- or in a
  microwave on MEDIUM [50%] power. )  Put a small scoop of the
  chocolate ice cream in the bottom of each of the six parfait glasses,
  and top each one with a small scoop of the mocha chip ice cream.
  Drizzle some of the mocha sauce over each serving.
  
  Repeat the layering process with the remaining ice cream and sauce.
  Top each parfait with a dollop of whipped cream and a few
  chocolate-covered coffee beans. Sift cocoa powder over the top and
  serve immediately.

      Title: MOCHA MOUSSE 3
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -============
           -(Makes about 4 cups)
 
  Ingredients:
  
  9 oz.      (250 g.) very high quality milk chocolate. 4-5 tsp (110 mL)
  powdered instant coffee (not freeze dried), dissolved in 1/4 cup plus
  1 tblsp water (71 mL). ***** 1 1/2 cup (340 mL) heavy cream 1.) Place
  chocolate and coffee in a medium-size heatproof bowl. Bring 1 in.
  (2.54 cm) of water to simmer in a wide skillet. Turn off the heat and
  wait 30 seconds.  Set bowl of chocolate in pan of water. Stir
  chocolate mixture until melted and smooth.  Or, melt in a microwave
  on LOW (30%) for about 2.5 minutes.  Remove chocolate from heat and
  let cool until a small dab on your upper lip feels slightly cool,
  about 85 F (~30 C).
  
  2.) Whip cream until soft peaks formnot too stiff. Fold carefully into
  choc.  mixture.  The mousse should seem very soft. Scrape immediately
  into mold, glasses, or onto dessert that it will enhance. The mousse
  sets quickly and should not be manipulated too much. Cover and
  refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 2 months.
  
  * A Note About Coffee:
  
  This is from the Cocolat book.  I trust Alice, you should too.
  
  "Normally, to use it properly as a flavoring, we require maximum
  taste with minimum liquid.  Rather than use coffee extract or
  flavoring from a bottle, I use one of the premium brands of instant
  coffee or espresso powder (but NOT freeze dried crystals).  Two
  brands that I like are Medaglio d'Oro and Cafe Salvador.
  
  "If (like me) you are too much of a coffee snob to ever dream of
  actually drinking instant coffee, you are probably thinking of using
  strong brewed coffee or real espresso. I recommend against this. [It]
  will deliver too much liquid and not enough flavor.  So, relax this
  time and open the jar."

   CAKE ROLL: 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 10x15-inch jelly
  roll pan.
      Line the pan with wax paper and grease the paper.
   2. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks and sugar
      together until the mixture is pale and fluffy.
   3. Sift the flour with the salt, baking powder, and spices. Add the
      dry ingredient to the batter.
   4. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff and gently
      fold them into the batter.
   5. Pour the batter into the prepared jelly roll pan. Bake for 20
  minutes.
      Remove from the oven and turn the cake over onto a clean linen
  dish
      towel that has been dusted with confectioners' sugar. Lift off the
      pan and let the cake cool for 10 minutes. Peel off the wax paper
  from
      the cake. Carefully roll the cake with the towel, jelly roll
  fashion,
      and let the cake remain in this position on a rack for 20-30
  minutes
      while it cools completely.
   6. When the cake is cooled, unroll to fill (IMPORTANT* If the cake is
      even slightly warm, the whipped cream filling will weep.) Spoon a
      generous amount of the mocha cream onto the inside of the cake,
      smoothing it to within 1-inch of all the edges.
   7. Roll the cake up to form a log. Place it seam side down on a
  platter.
      Spread the remainder of the mocha cream over the roll, frosting it
      evenly. Run the tines of a fork along the top of the cake roll to
      create decorative ridges resembling the bark of a tree.
  Refrigerate
      the cake roll until serving time. (If you choose to freeze the
      dessert, wrap it loosely in saran wrap. Defrost 2 hours in the
  fridge
      prior to serving.)

 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Heavy cream, well chilled
    1/3 c  Strained confectioner's
           -sugar
      3 tb Strained unsweetened cocoa
      1 ts Coffee zest (see note)
      2 tb Kahlua or Tia Maria
    1/2 ts Unsweetened cocoa, for
           -garnish
 
  Pour cream into a well-chilled mixing bowl.  Beat in an electric mixer
  fitted with chilled beaters or whip attachment. Stir in the
  confectioner's sugar and cocoa and beat on medium speed until the
  cream begins to thicken. Add the coffee zest and liqueur.  Continue
  whipping until cream reaches the soft peak stage, and remove from the
  mixer. Finish beating by hand using a wire whisk, whipping until
  cream is quite thick but not grainy. Refrigerate. Note:  to make
  coffee zest, add 3 parts coffee crystals to 1 part boiling water. To
  assemble the cake, split each layer into halves. Set the first layer
  on a serving plate, top side down. Fit a 14-inch pastry bag with a
  large no. 5 plain tube, and fill it 1/3 rd full with mocha whipped
  cream.  Starting 1/2 inch from the edge, pipe a circle of cream
  around the top of the layer. Fill center of the circle with
  additional cream, smoothing surface with a large metal offset
  spatula. Repeat with the second and third layers, placing them cut
  side up. Arrange the top layer cut side down, aligning layers so the
  sides of the cake are even. Empty the remaining whipped cream into
  the pastry bag. Pipe 1/2 inch whipped cream dots on the top layer,
  beginning at the outer edge. Each dot should touch the preceding one,
  forming a ring. Continue working toward the center of the cake until
  the entire surface is covered. Place 1/2 tsp cocoa in a very fine
  mesh strainer. Gently tap the strainer over the surface of the cake
  to give it a light dusting of cocoa.  Place the cake in the
  refrigerator uncovered to chill, but remove from refrigerator at
  least 1 hour before serving. Storage: Store leftover cake in the
  refrigerator under a foil tent. This cake will keep for up to three
  days.

      Title: MOCHIKO CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 lb Chicken cleaned*
      2 tb All Purpose flour
      4 tb Cornstarch
      4 tb Mochiko**
      4 tb Granulated Sugar
      5 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Chinese Oyster sauce
      2    Eggs
           MSG; Optional
           Chopped green onions
      7 tb Seasame seeds; to taste
 
  *boned and cut up in bite sizes. **(Sweet flour made from glutinous
  rice) Mix all of the ingredients with the cut up chicken in a large
  bowl, stir well to coat all of the chicken. Marinate for two or three
  hours. Fry in a large skillet as you would with normal fried chicken
  until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve hot. This basic
  recipe is from the Honpa Hongwanji Buddist Temple Cookbook published
  in Honolulu in 1973. That same Buddist temple has since then
  published an additional four or five cookbooks. All of them I am told
  are very good and offer a wide selection of island cooking covering
  all of the ethnic groups in Hawaii not only the Japanese-Hawaiians.
  Hawaii is a melting pot of races and it is also a melting pot of
  cuisines with each of its many ethnic groups contributing to the rich
  experience of Hawaiian foods. The island housewives "cook in many
  languages" and I indeed enjoyed, and still do enjoy, "eating in many
  languages" I hope this is the recipe you wanted Vicki. If not just
  send a message this way and I will attempt to get just what you wish.

MMMMM------------------FROM MEATLESS IN MINTUES-----------------------

MMMMM------------------------BY CAT PARAH-----------------------------
      1 lb Tofu
    1/2 c  Nutritional yeast flakes
    1/2 c  Raw cashews
      1 c  Rice, nut, or soy milk
      2 tb Margarine or butter
      1 tb Lemon juice
      1 ts Honey or sugar
      1 ts Mustard
    1/2 ts Salt
 
       Mix all ingredients in blender on high until smooth. Then just
  heat in saucepan and serve over your favorite vegetable.
  
       You could also add some chili powder and a dash of cayanne
  pepper (if you like it a bit spicey) and serve over nacho chips.
  
       It's also great on pizza, as a bread spread, in quiche, in
  layered casseroles, in lasagna, fondue...use your imagination.
  
       You may omitt either the cashews or the yeast flakes (but not
  both) and still have a yummy cheese-type sauce. I enjoy it best with
  both but when I'm out of one of those I go ahead and omitt it.
  
       You may also substitute 1 1/2 more cups of the milk for the Tofu
  if you don't have any.  Just thicken it with cornstarch when you heat
  it.

      Title: MOCK CHICKEN (BUDDHIST)
 Categories: Chinese, Vegetarian, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    3/4 c  Basic chicken stock
      2 tb Light soy sauce
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Oriental sesame oil
      1 ts Salt
      8    Dried bean-curd sheets,
           -soaked to soften
           Peanut oil for deep-frying
 
  I got into the cookbooks looking for the Buddhist mock meat dishes
  and ran across a bunch of other "mock" stuff, some of it vegetarian
  and meant to satisfy the craving for meat and some of it meant to
  represent other ingredients not available at the time.  This first
  recipe is for "Mock Chicken".  I'm not sure if the use of chicken
  stock would be permitted to a strict Buddhist vegetarian++I suspect
  not++but I imagine a hearty veggie stock could be substituted. Dried
  bean curd can give a surprisingly realistic impression of meat
  products.
  
  Bring stock, soy, sugar, sesame oil and salt to boil. Cool. fold
  bean-curd sheets into oblongs (approximately 4 by 8 inches) and stack
  the sheets on top of each other, spooning the stock mixture between
  each layer. Roll stacked sheets into oblong loaf, wrap in cheesecloth
  and steam on rack over boiling water for 20 0minutes. Remove
  cheesecloth and fry loaf in deep oil until golden.  Drain and cut
  into 1/2-inch diagonal slices.

      2 tb Vegetable oil
      3 tb Nutritional yeast
      1    Vegetable bouillon cube
    1/2 c  Diced fresh mushrooms
    1/2 c  Finely chopped onion
           Onion salt; to taste
           Unbleached all-purpose flour
 
  Steam the spinach and drain well.
  
  Heat the oil or water in a medium frying pan over medium heat. Cook
  the onion, stirring occasionally, until transparent, about 5 minutes.
  
  Dissolve the imitation chicken-flavored powder or bouillon powder in
  the boiling water.  Add the TVP and let stand for about 10 minutes.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Pat the tofu dry, then mash.  In a large bowl, combine the TVP
  mixture, spinach and tofu.  Stir in the remaining ingredients and
  pour the mixture into a lightly greased 8-1/2 x 4-1/2-inch loaf pan.
  Smooth the top and bake for 45 minutes, or until brown on top.
  
  If the loaf begins to get too brown on top, cover with aluminum foil.
  Make the gravy.  In a large suacpan, simmer all the ingredients
  except the flour for approximately 5 minutes. Slowly add the flour
  (tablespoon by tablespoon), whisking after each addition, until
  desired thickness is reached.  Keep warm.
  
  Let loaf stand for 10 mintues, then run a knife around the edges and
  turn out onto a platter.  Serve with gravy.

 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    1/4 lb Fresh filet of sole, plaice
           -(flounder) or cod
      6    Egg yolks
      2    Level tablespoons chopped
           -spring onions (scallions),
           -white parts only
      1 ts Sesame oil
    1/4    Level teaspoon MSG
           -[optional, as usual. S.C.]
    1/4    Level teaspoon salt
    1/8    Level teaspoon white pepper
           Fat for deep-frying
      5 tb Soy sauce
      3 tb Vinegar
 
  "When the crab season ended, people were loath to give up the idea of
  being without crab.  The following recipe is an excellent dish, but a
  poor substitute for the heady concentrate of roe found in the furry-
  clawed crabs of the Yangtse lakes."
  
  Steam the fish for 10 minutes and flake it gently. Mix the egg yolks
  together with the spring onions, sesame oil, MSG, salt and white
  pepper. Add the fish and mix it in. Fry tablespoons of the mixture in
  fairly deep fat, until the sides are almost brown or pinkish gold.
  The fat will foam, but this cannot be helped. The final texture must
  be firm. Serve hot with a separate dish of soy sauce mixed with
  vinegar. Excellent with warmed wine.

      2 ts Wine
      1 tb Soy sauce
      1    Level tablespoon corn flour
           -(cornstarch)
           Oil for deep-frying
      4 ts Brown bean sauce
      1 tb Water

    1/2    Level teaspoon red pepper,
           -crushed

    1/4 ts Sesame oil
    1/2    Level teaspoon corn flour
           -mixed with 4 tablespoons
           -water
 
  This dish is Szechwanese in origin.
  
  "The annual run of the shad upstream stopped east of Szechwan, where
  they spawned in lakes as large as small seas. Farther upstream, the
  waters became more turbulent. The rapids cut through gorges, making
  navigations upstream laborious, and the waters tan too swiftly to
  make lakes where fish could be raised. This may be the reason for a
  peculiar dish of pork known as Mock Fish, an attempt to reproduce the
  taste of a well-sauced fish. It you close your eyes you can almost
  believe it. The contrariness of Szechwan cooking lies in the fact
  that veal or beef may be substituted in the recipe below with little
  change in its taste. The taste of th original substances is all but
  lost in the sauce. No one seems to mind, because the use of
  seasonings is extraordinary.
  
  Sliver the pork very finely, and marinate it for 2 to 3 hours in a
  mixture of wine, soy sauce and corn flour. Deep-fry the slivers for
  about 2 minutes, until well browned. Set them aside to drain. In a
  bowl, mix together all the remaining ingredients except the corn
  flour and water mixture.  Saute the pork in the bean sauce mixture
  for a few minutes in a deep frying pan, until heated through.  Then
  thicken the sauce with the corn flour flour and water, stirring
  gently to make it smooth.

           Peanut oil; for frying
      1 sm Onion; sliced

     10    Wood ears; soaked to soften,

           - cut in slivers
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/3 c  Water
 
      Sprinkle potatoes with flour and deep-fry until golden.
   Drain and set aside. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the oil,
  reheat an add onion. Stir-fry 10 seconds and add snow peas and wood
  ears. Stir-fry another 10 seconds and add salt, sugar and water.
  Bring to rapid boil, stirring constantly, and cook until peas are
  just tender crisp. Add reserved fried potato slices, heat through and
  serve.
      Wood ears are a type of mushroom or shelf fungus. When soaked it
  has a crunchy, gelatinous texture with little taste. If you can't
  find them, I imagine that you could use the dried mushrooms although
  they wouldn't give exactly the same effect. A closer substitute would
  be dried jellyfish, but if you're some- where that sells dried
  jellyfish, I'm sure that they have wood ears as well...

    1/8 ts Black pepper; freshly ground
 
  Recipe by: Felicia Pickering <MNHAN063@SIVM.SI.EDU> * plus butter for
  greasing the pan
  
  Butter a 7-by-4-inch loaf pan.  Line with wax paper, leaving an
  overhang of about 1 1/2 inches all around to assist in lifting out
  the pate later.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 F.
  
  Rinse, dry and finely chop the mushrooms.  You should have about 5
  cups. In a large saucepan melt the butter, and saute the onions and
  celery until tender, about 5 minutes.
  
  In a large bowl beat the eggs and cream cheese until smooth. Add the
  bread crumbs, salt, basil, rosemary, oregano and pepper. Stir in the
  onion mixture and the mushrooms. Blend well.
  
  Spoon the mixture into the loaf pan.  Cover the top with foil, and
  bake until firm, about 1 1/2 hours. Cool in the pan until lukewarm.
  Remove from the pan, using the paper overhang as an aid. Serve at
  room temperature with crackers as an appetizer.

  Method: Pre-heat oven to gas mark 5, 375F, 190C. Toss the potatoes,
  apples, onions, cheese and sage together, seasoning with salt and
  pepper until they are well mixed. Turn the mixture into a large
  buttered ovenproof dish and cover with a lid of buttered foil or
  greaseproof paper. Bake for about 30 minutes until the fruit and
  vegetables are really tender. Meanwhile mix together the topping
  ingredients (Stuffing Mix and Grated Cheese). At the end of the
  cooking time uncover the dish, sprinkle the topping liberally over
  the dish and return to the oven, raising the temperature to gas mark
  9, 475F, 240C for 10 more minutes or until just nicely browned. Serve
  with a mixed green salad and plenty of crusty, wholemeal bread.

      3 tb Boiling water
           ICING
      1 tb Egg white, at room
           -temperature
      1 pn Of cream of tartar
    1/2 c  Plus 2 to 3 tbsp
           -confectioner's sugar
 
  These ultra-moist, dark chocolate mini-cupcakes are filled with creamy
  white chocolate ganache. They're a variation on a whimsical cupcake
  that Michael Roberts serves at Los Angeles's Trumps restaurant at
  teatime.
  
  CUPCAKES
  
  Make the cupcakes:
  
  1. Position a rack in the center and preheat oven to 325F. Lightly
  butter twenty-four 1-3/4" x 3/4" (1-oz) muffin of biscuit cups.
  
  2. Into a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda,
  and salt. Mix in the sugar. Make a well in the center. Whisk in the
  water, oil, vinegar, and vanilla. Blend until smooth. (The batter
  will be very thin.)
  
  3. Spoon the batter into the prepared cups. Bake until a cake tester
  inserted into the center of one of the cupcakes comes out clean,
  about 12 to 14 minutes. Cool the cupcakes in the pans on a wire rack
  for 5 minutes. Remove the cupcakes from the pans and finish cooling
  on the rack.
  
  Make the filling:
  
  4. In a heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the cream
  to a boil. Add the white chocolate and remove from heat. let the
  mixture stand briefly; stir until smooth. Transfer to a metal bowl
  and refrigerate until chilled thoroughly, stirring occasionally. (To
  speed the process, set the metal bowl over a larger bowl of ice
  water; stir the chocolate mixture until cool.) With an electric
  mixer, beat the whit chocolate mixture just until fluffy, about 1
  minute.
  
  5. Transfer the filling to a pastry bag fitted with a 3/8-inch plain
  tip. Insert the pastry tip 1/4-inch into the bottom of each cupcake
  and squeeze a little filling into each one.
  
  Make the glaze:
  
  6. Place the chocolate in a small bowl. Whisk in the boiling water and
  blend until smooth. One at a time, dip the top of each cupcake into
  the warm glaze. Turn the glazed cupcakes right side up and set them
  on a wire rack on top of a baking sheet. Refrigerate the cupcakes for
  5 minutes to set the glaze.
  
  Make the icing:
  
  7. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg white until frothy. Stir in the
  cream of tartar. Gradually mix in enough of the confectioner's sugar
  to make a fairly stiff and smooth icing. Fill a small paper cone with
  the icing and cut a 1/16-inch opening at the tip. Remove the cupcakes
  from the refrigerator. Pipe a design (a squiggle, spiral, etc.) on
  the top of each cupcake. Let the design harden and then cover and
  refrigerate the cupcakes. Serve at room temperature.
  
  The cupcakes can be made and refrigerated up to 2 days in advance, or
  frozen up to 2 weeks.
  
  Makes 22 to 24 miniature cupcakes.

      Title: MOCK LOBSTER
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      2 lb Haddock; fillet
           Tomato juice; or V8/to cover
    1/2 c  Chili sauce
    1/2 c  Horseradish; prepared
    1/4 c  Sour cream
 
  Poach fish in tomato juice to cover with spices of your choice or in
  V8. Simmer until fish flakes. Mix the other ingredients together and
  adjust for YOUR taste. Add the sauce to the fish...making sure it is
  not too thick. It should look like lobster salad and you can use
  diced celery and/or onion. In the 50's whenever you went to a
  luncheon at the Temple it seems that this was the dish of choice. I
  guess we were trying to prove we could have 'lobster' and be kosher
  too, <GRIN>!!!! Anyway it is quite good. If you have a fovorite
  lobster or shrimp salad; you could just substitute the fish. Back in
  those days it was cheaper...now who knows??? Recipe originally taken
  from the LEVITTOWN JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER COOKBOOK; circa 1956.

  stainless steel kettle; add a measurement of water equal to the
  amount of discarded tomato juice. Bring mixture to a boil.  Remove
  from heat and drain mixture as above. Measure juice and discard.
  Return tomatoes to kettle, add water equal to amount of water
  discarded. Bring to a boil and repeat draining process. Return
  tomatoes to kettle and add amount of water equal to discarded tomato
  juice. Wash, core and chop apples. Add apples, raisins, vinegar,
  sugar, cinnamon, allspice, cloves and salt to tomato mixture. Cook
  until thick (1 to 1 1/2 hours), stirring frequently. Mixture will
  stick and burn quickly. Ladle hot mincemeat into hot sterilized jars,
  leaving 1" headspace. Adjust caps.  Process 20 minutes in boiling
  water bath. Note: This mincemeat can be used as a pie filling for
  cakes, in cookies or eaten as you would jelly on biscuits, English
  muffins or toast. It also makes a great topping for ice cream. One
  quart of mincemeat is sufficient for a 9-inch pastry shell.

      Title: MOCK PEKING DUCK
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Fatty, boneless pork

MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
      2 tb Sherry
      1 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Hoisin sauce
      1    Green onion, chopped fine
      1 tb Grated fresh ginger
      1 tb Minced garlic
      1 tb Brown sugar
      1 ts Five spice powder

MMMMM---------------------------BATTER--------------------------------
      3 tb Flour
      3 tb Cornstarch
      1    Egg, beaten
    1/4 c  Beer (flat is OK)
 
  Cut the pork into strips roughly 1/4 inch by three inches. Combine
  marinade ingredients, and add pork. Marinate overnight.
  
  Meanwhile, make the batter by mixing the flour and cornstarch. Beat
  the egg well, and add to mixture, add the beer, and mix well. Make
  this ahead of time and refrigerate a few hours-it can be made at the
  same time as the marinade, and can also sit overnight.
  
  When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 375 degrees, take pork out of
  marinade, and bake in a shalow pan for about an hour, turning
  occasionally and stirring to separate the strips if necessary. Remove
  from oven, cool to room temp., and blot off excess fat with a paper
  towel.
  
  In a wok, heavy pan, or electric skillet, heat 2 cups (at least) of
  peanut oil to 375 degrees.
  
  Give the batter a stir, and coat the pork strips with it. Deep fry
  them, about 1/4 at a time, in the hot oil for about 30 seconds,
  poking them a little bit to separate the strips. Allow the oil to
  come back up to temperature in between batches.  Drain the fried
  strips well. You can do this before you're ready to serve, and reheat
  if necessary.
  
  Serve with a little hoisin sauce on the side.
  
  The traditional way to serve real Peking duck is folded up in a peking
  pancake with a little hoisin sauce and some shredded scallion. IMHO,
  these pancakes are just too much trouble to make.  If I feel like it,
  I make mock Peking pancakes to go with the mock Peking duck. You do
  it like this:
  
  Get a pack of flour tortillas-the smaller "soft taco" or "fajita"
  size. Brush one side of each very lightly with sesame oil. Put the
  oiled sides together, so you've got a bunch of double tortillas,
  stuck together with sesame oil in the middle.
  
  On an ungreased pan, cook each tortilla "sandwich" briefly on both
  sides (like you would heat a regular tortilla) for 10 seconds or so,
  until they "puff up" slightly.
  
  Take the tortillas, put them in one stack.  Wrap in aluminum foil and
  steam in a steamer for about 15 minutes. Separate them into
  individual tortillas. You now have mock peking pancakes.
  
  To serve them with the "duck," take a "pancake," smear with a little
  hoisin sauce in the center.  Take a little "duck", put in center, and
  sprinkle with a little shredded scallion to taste. Fold up like a
  miniture burrito, and eat.

 Categories: Sauces, Low-cal, Low-fat, Desserts
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
    3/4 ts Unflavored gelatin
      1 tb Cold water
    1/2 c  Nonfat dry milk powder
    1/2 c  Ice water
      2 tb Confectioner's sugar
      1 ts Vanilla
 
  A fluffy, all-purpose topping that can double as a filling. Properly
  whipped, it will be stiff enough to mound or pipe through a pastry
  bag. Soften the gelatin in the cold water in a small heatproof
  measuring cup. Set the cup in a pan of simmering water and heat about
  4 minutes until the gelatin dissolves; remove from the heat. Combine
  the dry milk, ice water, and confectioner's sugar in the chilled
  small bowl of an electric mixer, then beat with chilled beaters at
  medium speed until foamy. With the motor running, carefully pour the
  gelatin down the side of the bowl so that it doesn't hit the beaters
  and spatter all over. Continue beating at medium speed for 7 to 10
  minutes until it is the texture of whipped cream, then beat in the
  vanilla. If not using immediately, store in the refrigerator. If the
  mixture should deflate on standing, simply beat until it again
  resembles whipped cream. Makes 3 cups

      Title: MODENA RICE PUDDING
 Categories: Desserts, Rice
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  3 1/2 c  Milk
      7 oz Superfine Arborio Or Roma
           -Rice
  8 3/4 oz Sugar
  1 1/2 tb Unsalted Butter
      5 lg Eggs, Beaten
      2 ts Grated Lemon Zest
      4 oz High Quality Candied Citron
           -Finely Diced Or:
    3/4 c  Blanched Almonds, Toasted &
           -Coarsely Chopped
 
  One day ahead, wrop the dish and refrigerate in the refrigerator
  until 1 hour before baking. The food of grandmothers, this baked rice
  pudding is scented with citron or almond. Baking burnishes it to a
  glowing gold and makes it firm enough to be sliced like a cake.
  Although made throughout the region,this rendition from Modena was
  shared by Catherine Piccolo of the Modena/St. Paul Minnesota, Sister
  City Committee. This pudding is the dessert served after Sunday
  dinner in farmhouses on the Po River plain. It is pulled from the
  cold pantry for special quests, and is especially favored around
  Easter time.  The pudding can be made before serving. It is equally
  good served warm from the oven or chilled.
  
  In a heavy 3-4 quart saucepan, combine the milk and rice. Bring to a
  gentle bubble over igh heat.  Turn the heat down to low, cover
  tightly,and cook 20-25 mminutes at a very slow bubble. Stir
  occasionally to check for sticking. When the rice is tender but still
  a little resistant to the bite (it will be a little soupy), stir in
  the sugar. Turn it into a bowl and allow it to cool. Butter a 9 inch
  springorm pan with the 1-1/2 tbsp butter. Preheat the oven to 350F.
  Stir the eggs,lemon zest, and citron or almonds into the cooled rice.
  Turn into the pan, and bake 55-65 minutes, or until a knife inserted
  2 inches from the edge comes out clean. To serve at room temperature,
  cool the pudding to room temperature on a rack, and then unmold.
  REfrigerate if you will be holding it for longer than 2 hours. Slice
  into narrow wedges. Serve warm by reheating the pudding in its mold
  at 325 F about 20 minutes. Then release the sides of the pan and set
  on a round plate.

      Title: MODIFICATIONS TO JOY OF COOKING CHOCOLATE CAK
 Categories: Digest, Nov.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           None
 
  I've had good results modifying the 'quick oil cake' in the Joy of
  Cooking. If you have the book, make all of the usual substitutions:
  applesauce for oil, defatted cocoa for cocoa, ener-g egg replacer for
  eggs. To make it really chocolatey, I halve the sugar amount, add an
  extra 1/4-1/2 c. of cocoa. I usually double the recipe because my
  housemates can snarf the whole cake in 12 hours (which acts as a
  major control on *my* consumption :-) . If you don't have the book,
  and want the recipe, let me know and I'll write one up and post it.
  
  For frosting, I just mix up a little rice milk, cocoa, and powdered
  sugar and make a glaze, and pour it on the warm cake so it soaks in a
  bit.

      1 tb Cornstarch

  This recipe is a combination of the best parts of many other General
  Tso's Chicken recipes I have seen. I use this recipe on a regular
  basis. I have used de-boned chicken thighs with good success. Have
  made it using orange or lemon peel and liked it with either. Have
  used small Vidalia onion in place of scallions also. Be careful when
  using the water chestnut flour, it doesn't brown as much as regular
  flour, so don't overcook. The sauce will make the dish darker. I
  tried using a deep fryer for cooking the chicken without success. The
  chicken kept sticking to the fryer basket. Have found that using a
  wok and cooking about 5 pieces of chicken at a time works better for
  me. Cut the chicken into pieces no larger than 1" square. Prepare
  marinade by combining egg white, cornstarch, and 1 tablespoon soy
  sauce in a large bowl. Add chicken pieces and set aside for two
  hours. In a deep pot, heat the oil until it reaches 350 degrees.
  Dredge marinated chicken pieces in water chestnut powder to coat. In
  a basket, or with a slotted spoon, lower several marinated chicken
  pieces into the fat. Fry about one or two minutes or until the
  chicken becomes crisp; test for doneness before completing the batch.
  Continue until all pieces have been fried. Set oil and cooked chicken
  pieces aside. In a wok, on high heat, reheat two tablespoons of the
  reserved oil. Add prepared ginger, scallions, garlic, chili peppers,
  and orange or lemon peel. Stir to prevent burning. Add the fried
  chicken and stir quickly.Add sugar, soy sauce, vinegar and cornstarch
  mixed with chicken stock. Remove from the heat and stir sesame oil
  into the sauce. Spoon the mixture on to a hot platter and serve

      Title: MOGGY
 Categories: Cakes, Ethnic
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Plain flour
      3 ts Baking powder
      6 oz Lard
      6 oz Margarine
      8 oz Golden syrup
      8 oz Sugar
           Salt
           Milk as necessary

  pieces 1" thick . PLce on a greased baking tin and bake in a
  moderate oven for about 25 mins, until firm and light brown. Cut and
  serve thickly buttered.
  
  Remarks: This recipe can be found in many very old books, and may
  have come form the Old Norse language, where a heap of corn was known
  as Mugi. The word can be traced back through early English, where
  corn was refered to as Muge and later Muga. In it's ealiest form, it
  was probably made with yeast and honey instead of baking powder and
  syrup/sugar.

      1    Cut Up Chicken
           Favorite Barbecue Sauce
           Bed Of Medium Hot Coals
 
  As in my holiday turkey, I like to have my barbecued chicken moist and
  juicy. This is more of a technique than any special recipe. Place
  chicken pieces on the grill. Cook for 2 minutes and turn over. Baste
  each piece with sauce.  Cook for 3 or 4 minutes.  Turn and baste.
  Keep turning and basting at 3-4 minute intervals until chicken is
  done. By turning at frequent intervals the sauce doesn't have time to
  burn. If there is anything special about the technique it is the
  frequent turning and the bed of medium hot coals. From: Syd's

      Title: MOIST HOLIDAY TURKEY
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     18 lb Tom Or Hen Turkey *
    1/4 lb Butter
      3 tb Fresh Orange Juice
           Stuffing of Choice **
           Salt
 
  * Fresh or frozen. ** Do not add any salt to your stuffing mix.
  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~------------- ~-- Preheat oven to 325F.  Remove the giblets from
  the bird. Rub the inside of the clean body cavity with salt until
  there is a coating of salt over the whole inside.  This holds the
  juice inside the bird and the salt will season your dressing. Even
  after cooking most of the salt will remain inside of the body cavity.
  Place the stuffing in the bird and close the body cavity.  Melt the
  butter and add the orange juice. Baste the bird with the
  butter/orange juice mixture. Place a meat thermometer between the
  thigh and body in the meaty part of the thigh, not touching any bone.
  Bake the bird until the thermometer reads 190F, basting frequently.
  When the skin turns golden brown, tent the bird with a large sheet of
  aluminum foil. Allow the bird to cool while making gravy, then carve
  and serve a moist holiday tradition. If you use an aluminum baking
  pan it will add about one hour to the baking time.  If a moist turkey
  is what you want, give this method a try.  I have not had any
  problems with using the excess salt and I have a problem with too
  much salt. From: Syd's Cookbook.

      Title: MOIST TOWELETTES
 Categories: Misc
      Yield: 4 Dozen
 
     24    Squares of white Bounty-
           -brand paper towels
      1 c  Witch hazel
      1 ts Glycerin; opt
 
  These handy wash-up towels cost less than half the price of their
  commercial conterparts while they contain no harsh alcohols or bizarre
  preservatives and they stay fresh and moist just long. Separate and
  stack each of the towel squares from the roll; cut each square in
  half. Place the rectangles in front of you vertically; fold each
  rectangle into thirds as if you were folding up a business letter;
  then fold the letter in half, as if you were closing a book. Place
  all but 4 of the folded towelettes on a single or double layer in a
  large shallow lassagne-type pan; set the pan aside. In a shaker jar,
  combine the witch hazel and glycerin. (The glycerin in not essential;
  however it allows the towelettes to remain moist for long periods of
  time as well as being good for the skin.) Drizzle the liquid evenly
  over the pan of towels and allow them to absorb for several minutes.
  Press the towels to help them absorb any excess liquid; if any liquid
  remains, press in 1 or more of the reserved towels. Stack the
  moistened towelettes in a liddle plastic 2-cup container; cover
  securely and use as needed when traveling with children, on picnics,
  in the car, etc. If the towelettes begin to dry out, simply pour in a
  little more with hazel. VARIATION-WINDSHIELD WIPERS-If you have used
  glycerin, they can be used as an effective automobile
  windshield-wiping cloth in even the coldest weather. CARRY-ALONG
  WIPERS-Pack up to 10 moist towelettes in a zip-loc sandwich bag to
  carry in a purse, tote bag or lunchbox. WIPEY-DIPEY-Replace the witch
  hazel and glycerin with 1 cup light mineral oil or 1 c baby oil;
  saturate and package the folded towelettes as directed. Use as a
  half-price, alcohol-free diaper wipe for baby. Source: Health and

      Title: MOLASSES BRAN BREAD & VARIATIONS
 Categories: Digest, Jan.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ts Soda
    1/2 c  Blackstrap molasses
  1 1/2 c  Sour milk or buttermilk
           (skim)
  1 1/2 c  Bran
    1/2 c  Raisins
  1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
 
  Dissolve soda in molasses, add sour milk and mix well. Mix in bran and

  greased or lined with wax paper, and spread evenly. Bake 45 minutes
  in a moderate oven (350 deg. F)
  
  My variations: I substitute 3/4 cup skim milk + 3/4 cup skim yogurt
  for the buttermilk.  I substitute 1 1/2 cups oatmeal for the bran.
  Last time I made this, I also added 2 grated carrots, and had nice
  carrot cake. I also plump the raisins in the microwave with some
  water.

  This is from an Amish cookbook. I have modified the directions to
  explain better: Cream the shortening and sugar. Add the eggs,
  molasses and syrup. Then sift together the dry ingredients and
  alternately stir in the flour and milk.  Bake for 5 to 8 minutes in a
  375 degree oven. The molasses in the cookies make them very prone to
  burn so check often.. the recipe could be halved as this makes about
  80 cookies!!

  stick to your finger. It does hold some shape while kneading. Flour
  your work surface and rolling pin. When the cycle is complete, turn
  the dough out onto the floured surface and let it sit for 10 minutes.
  Roll the dough to 1/3" thick. Use enough flour to keep the dough from
  sticking. Cut doughnuts with cutter.
  
  Place the doughnuts on a greased baking sheet and cover with a clean
  towel. Let rise for 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk. Heat 1 1/2 to
  2" of oil in saucepan or deep fryer. Use a thermometer to help keep
  the temperature constant. Fry 2 to 3 doughnuts at a time. Fry them
  for 2 to 3 minutes, turning frequently and spooning the hot oil over
  them. Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Check the
  first few for doneness. Shake the warm doughnuts, 3 or 4 at a time,
  in a sturdy paper bag with sugar in it.

  Put butter in saucepan and when melted add sugar, molasses and water.
  Stir until sugar is dissolved, and let boil without stirring until
  mixture will form a very soft ball that will just keep its shape when
  tried in cold water.  Turn out on a cold platter or agate tray, and
  as mixture cools around sides fold toward center. When cool enough to
  handle, pull until porous and light colored with tips of fingers and
  thumbs. Be careful not to squeeze it in the hand.  Cut in small
  pieces with large scissors or a sharp knife and arrange on slightly
  buttered plates, or wrap in wax paper. A few srops of oil of
  peppermint, clove or cinnamon may be added during the pulling.

      6    Eggs, separated

      1 c  Boiling water
  2 1/2 ts Vanilla, divided
      2 tb Dark rum, brandy or bourbon
    1/8 ts Salt
      2 c  Heavy cream
    1/3 c  Confectioner's sugar
 
  FROM:      Woman's Day, 9/2/80
  
  Make early in day or day before.  Double recipe for large loaf pan or
  2 pans, using very large bowl for folding egg whites with chocolate.
  
  For easy unmolding prepare 9x5x3-inch loaf pan this way: use 2 pieces
  waxed paper, one for length, one for width of pan. Fold each
  lengthwise as necessary to fit pan exactly: it's best to have more
  than one thickness. Put strips in pan, extending slightly above rim
  on all sides.
  
  Pour cold water into 2-cup glass measure.  Sprinkle with gelatin; let
  stand at least 5 minutes. Meanwhile in 1-1/2 to 2 quart bowl, beat
  egg yolks with 1 cup sugar 5 minutes or until thick and light
  colored. Stir in chocolate until smooth, scraping bowl with rubber
  spatula; set aside.
  
  Add coffee and boiling water to softened gelatin; stir mixture into
  stiff chocolate mixture scraping bowl constantly, until smooth. Beat
  in 1-1/2 tsp vanilla and the rum. Transfer mixture to 4-quart bowl;
  place in large bowl of ice and cold water. Stir, scraping bottom and
  sides 2-3 minutes or until very cold but not thick. Remove from water
  temporarily; set aside.
  
  In large bowl beat whites with salt until foamy. Gradually beat in
  remaining 1/2 cup sugar until soft peaks form.
  
  Return bowl of chocolate mixture to ice water; stir 2-3 minutes or
  until mixture barely starts to thicken. Remove bowl from ice water.
  Fold half the mixture into whites, then fold into remaining mixture
  (do not overfold).
  
  Pour gently from one bowl to another to insure thorough blending.
  Refrigerate 8-10 hours or overnight.
  
  To unmold: since most loaf pans flare, corners probably will not be
  lined with wax paper. With small, sharp knife loosen corners. Invert
  flat platter over loaf pan; invert pan over platter. Remove pan;
  gently peel way paper. Whip creamwith confectioner's sugar and
  remaining 1 tsp vanilla to thick saucelike consistency. (If desired,
  whip about 1/2 cup of the heavy cream until stiff. Pipe on mousse to
  garnish.) Spoon generously over each slice of mousse.
  
  Makes 10 servings.

 Categories: Relishes, Holiday
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
      2 c  Marshmallow creme
      1 c  Heavy whipping cream
      3 oz Cream cheese

MMMMM---------------------------RELISH--------------------------------
     10 oz Cranberries, fresh
    3/4 c  Water
      6 oz Raspberry Jello mix
           -(1 package)
    1/4 c  Sugar, granulated
      1 c  Celery, chopped fine
      1 c  Tokay grapes
           -(quartered and seeded)
  2 1/2 c  Pineapple (canned),
           -crushed, including
           -syrup (one #2 can)
 
  MAKE DRESSING:  The night before serving the relish, place the cream
  cheese and marshmallow creme in a small bowl. Mash lightly with a
  fork to barely break up cream cheese. Add whipping cream and cover
  tightly. Refrigerate overnight.
  
  15 minutes before serving, whip mixture with an electric mixer until
  it reaches the consistency of thick, but not stiff, whipped cream.
  
  MAKE RELISH:  Rinse cranberries thoroughly.  Place in an 8-cup
  saucepan with water and cover. Bring to a boil and cook until the
  berries have "popped." Remove from heat and, using an electric mixer,
  beat gently until all the berries are broken. Add Jello and sugar.
  Place saucepan over a bowl of ice and stir occasionally until mixture
  has thickened but not jelled.
  
  Add grapes, celery and crushed pineapple (including packing syrup).
  Pour into prepared mold and chill in refrigerator until set (about 3
  hours).
  
  To serve, unmold relish onto a plate and place dressing in a separate
  dish. Serve a couple of dollops of dressing with each serving of
  relish.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  For years my mother required us to taste her ever-changing version
  of a fresh cranberry relish she insisted serving at Thanksgiving and
  Christmas. The unanimous family response to the inevitably bitter
  dish was, "Do we have to?" Then one year a friend came to
  Thanksgiving dinner and contributed what is now known simply as "the
  recipe." Mom never tried to improve on this addictive relish. Yield:
  Serves 8-10.
  
  *  The most difficult step is in unmolding the relish. I always spray
  my mold very lightly with a coating of an aerosol cooking oil (such
  as "PAM") before filling it with the relish. When it's time to
  unmold, I run a thin spatula around the outside of the molded relish
  to barely loosen it, place the serving plate on top and invert the
  mold and plate. I rarely have to dip the mold in hot water to loosen
  the relish.
  
  *  I usually use a standard ring mold and put the dressing in a footed
  compote which sits in the center of the unmolded ring of relish.

  : Seenote: dried peppers; Mikenote, After the peppers have been
  toasted and soaked I strain them through a foley food mill, to remove
  ALL of the skin and seeds. This is a longer messier solution to
  grinding them in a blender but it makes a smoother, less stringent
  sauce. Another method is to toast and soak the peppers and then lay
  them down on a cutting board and use the blade of knife, scrape the
  reconstituted pepper off from the skin..... longer, messier, but
  do-able....
   Simmer the chicken in stock until tender about 1/2 hour. Remove the
  chicken and keep warm and reserve the stock.
   In a large frying pan or comal, toast the chiles, turning once until
  darkened, but not burned. Toast the guajillo a little longer because
  of their tougher skins. Place the chiles in a bowl and cover with hot
  water to soak for 1/2 hour to soften. Remove the chiles and place in
  a blender or food processor and puree, adding a little chile water if
  necessary, strain.
   Toast the peppercorns, cloves, and cinnamon lightly in a dry pan or
  comal. Cool and grind in a molcajete or spice grinder.
   In the same pan, roast the onion and garlic cloves until slightly
  browned. Cool and place in a food processor and puree with a little
  water. Heat the lard in a pan until smoking hot, and fry the bread
  until lightly brown, remove and drain on paper towels. Fry the
  plantain on both sides until brown, remove and drain. Quickly fry the
  raisins, remove. Lower the heat and add the sesame seeds, stirring
  constantly for a couple of minutes. Then add the almonds and continue
  to fry until both are well browned. Remove, drain, and combine with
  the bread, plantain and raisins, reserving some of the sesame seeds
  for garnish. Place in a food processor or blender and puree, adding a
  little water if necessary. Wipe out the skillet with a cloth and add
  1 tb lard. When it is hot, add the tomatoes and fry well. Place in a
  blender or food processor and puree, remove. Heat a tablespoon of
  lard in a cazuela or heavy pot until smoking. Add the chile puree and
  fry, stirring constantly, so it will not burn. It tends to splatter
  about, so be careful! Fry for a couple of minutes, add the tomato
  puree, the ground spices, and the marjoram and heat through. Stir in
  the bread mixture and continue to heat, stirring constantly. Add the
  chocolate and the avocado leaves, thin with the reserved chicken
  stock and continue to simmer for 30 minutes. Add the chicken, adjust
  the salt, and heat through. Serve with black beans, rice, and
  tortillas. Heat scale medium

  Recipe by: Bernard Salmon <li899sab@kauri.vuw.acupnz> Put the chicken
  pieces in a pan with the onions and garlic, cover withwater bring to
  the boil and simmer for 30 minutes or 'til the chicken is almost
  cooked. Drain off and reserve the stock, and dry the chicken pieces.
  Melt the lard in a heavy based pan and gently fry the chicken pieces
  on all side 'til they are lightly tanned.
  
  Meanwhile, remove the stems and seeds from the chilis, tear them up
  and soak the pieces in 300ml boiling water for 30 minutes. Then, in a
  liquidiser, puree the chilis with their water, the onions, garli
  tomatoes, nuts and seeds, spices, seasoning and chocolate. Remove the
  chicken pieces from the pan and pour off any excess fat. Fry the
  puree in the remaining lard for a few minutes, then add the meat with
  enough of the chicken stock for the sauce just to cover the meat, and
  continue to simmer gently for 30 minutes, or 'til the chicken is
  thoroughly cooked. Ideally the mole should be put aside for 24 hours
  at this point to allow th flavours to develop.
  
  When you are ready to serve the mole, reheat it, adjust the seasoning
  to taste, and add a little sugar if you feel it necessary. Serve it
  with plent of tortillas, white rice, beans and guacamole.
  
  Serves 6.

      3    Thick slices dried French
           -bread or semisweet roll
      2 oz Tablet Mexican drinking
           -chocolate
           Sea salt to taste
 
  Oaxacan Black Mole Serves 10 to 12
  
  The Chicken:
  
  Put the chicken into a saucepan with the garlic, onions, and mint. Add
  water to cover and salt to taste. Bring to a simmer, cover the pan,
  and continue simmering until the chicken is just tender - about 35
  minutes. Strain, reserving the broth.
  
  Remove stems from the dried chilies, if any, slit them open, and
  remove seeds and veins, reserving the seeds. Toast the chilies for
  about 50 seconds on each side; if you're using guajillos, toast them
  longer, until they are almost charred - about 2 minutes. Rinse the
  chilies in cold water, cover with hot water, and leave to soak for
  about 30 minutes. Put the reserved chile seeds into an ungreased
  frying pan and toast over fairly high heat, shaking them around from
  time to time so that they brown evenly. Then raise the heat and char
  until black. Cover with cold water and set aside to soak for about 5
  minutes.  Strain and put into a blender jar.
  
  Add the broiled tomatoes, unpeeled, to the blender jar along with the
  water, cloves, allspice, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.
  
  Heat some of the lard in a small frying pan and fry the sesame seed
  until a deep golden color - a few seconds. Strain, putting the fat
  back into the pan and the seeds into the blender jar, and blend as
  smooth as possible.
  
  Fry the rest of the ingredients, except the chilies and chocolate,
  one by one, strain, and put into the blender jar, blending after each
  addition and adding water or broth as necessary to release the blades.
  
  heat 1/4 cup of the lard in the heavy pan in which you are going to
  cook the mole, add the blended mixture, and fry over medium heat,
  stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan from time to time, for
  about 15 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, put a few of the chilies and about 2 cups of the water in
  which they were soaking into the blender jar and blend until smooth.
  When you have blended all the chilies, add them to the fried
  ingredients together with the chocolate and cook for 5 minutes
  longer. Add about 4 cups of the chicken broth and continue cooking
  for 35 minutes. (Skim the fat that forms on the top if you are going
  to make tamales or mole. It is added to color and flavor the masa.)
  Add more broth if necessary - the mole should just coat the back of a
  wooden spoon - along with the chicken and salt to taste; cook for 10
  minutes longer.

  ***ROASTING THE CHILIES ***
  
  1. Lay dried mulato, ancho, pasilla, and chipotle chilies in a single
  layer in 10x15" pans. Bake in a 300'F. oven until chilies smell
  lightly toasted and are flexible, 5-8 minutes. While they are still
  warm, discard stems and shake out seeds.
  
  2. Rinse chilies and put in a large bowl; add 8 cups boiling water.
  Let stand until soft, 20-30 minutes. Drain; save liquid. Smoothly
  puree chilies, a portion at a time, in food processor or blender. Add
  a total 2 cups reserved liquid. (In processor, use a little liquid to
  get mixture moving; add rest when pureed.) Rub firmly through fine
  strainer into a bowl; discard residue. Use, or chill airtight up to 1
  day.
  
  *** ROASTING THE VEGETABLES ***
  
  1. In a 10x15" pan, combine onions, tomato, tomatillos, garlic (cut
  side down), and tortillas. Bake in a 450'F. oven, turning
  occasionally, until the vegetables and tortillas have dark brown
  spots or edges. Let cool. Pull off vegetable skins and discard.
  
  2. Smoothly puree mixture in a food processor or blender; add a total
  of 1 cup reserved chili-soaking liquid, from step 1. (In processor,
  use a little liquid to get mixture moving; add rest when pureed.) Rub
  firmly through fine strainer into a bowl; discard residue. Use, or
  chill airtight up to 1 day.
  
  *** COOKING THE SEASONINGS AND THICKENERS ***
  
  1. In a 10x12" frying pan over medium heat, stir sesame seed until
  toasted, about 4 minutes; set aside.
  
  2. To pan, add oil, plantain, almonds, peanuts, prunes, raisins,
  cinnamon, coriander, and anise. Stir often over medium heat until
  mixture is richly browned, 10-15 minutes. Smoothly puree mixture and
  sesame seed in a food processor or blender. Add remaining
  chili-soaking liquid, from step 1. (In processor, use a little to get
  moving; add rest when pureed.) Use, or chill airtight up to 1 day.
  
  *** ASSEMBLING THE MOLE ***
  
  1. In a 5-6 quart pan, mix chilies, vegetables, seasonings and
  thickeners, and broth. Bring to a simmer on medium heat; cover and
  simmer to blend flavors, about 2 hours, stirring often.

      Title: MOLE POBLANO DE DOS CHILES
 Categories: Poultry, Mexican, Pork, Chocolate
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6    Mulato chiles
      6    Pasilla chiles
      8 lb Turkey, in pieces
      1 lb Pork loin, in 2" chunks
      4 tb Lard
    1/2 c  Almonds
    1/2 c  Peanuts
      1    Tortilla, coarsely chopped
      4 tb Sesame seeds
    1/8 ts Ground cloves
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Anise
      1 lb Tomatoes, seeded, chopped
      1 oz Unsweetened chocolate
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
      1 ts Sugar
 
  Prepare the chiles as described above in the recipe for Mole Poblano
  Picante. Place the turkey and pork in a large kettle with enough
  salted water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook, covered, for 1
  hour. Drain, reserving the stock. Dry the turkey and pork pieces
  thoroughly with paper towels. Heat the lard in a large, heavy
  skillet. Brown the turkey and pork pieces, a few at a time; then
  transfer to a flameproof casserole. In the electric blender, blend
  the almonds, peanuts, tortilla, 2 tbs of the sesame seeds, cloves,
  cinnamon, anise, tomatoes, and the prepared chiles, and reduce to a
  coarse puree.
  
  Heat the lard remaining in the skillet, adding a little more if
  necessary, and cook the mixture for 5 minutes, stirring constantly.
  Add 2 cups of the reserved stock, the chocolate, salt and pepper to
  taste, and sugar. Stir until chocolate has melted. Pour the sauce
  over the turkey and pork in the casserole; cover; and cook over very
  low heat for about 1 hour, taking care not to let it burn. Sauce
  should be the consistency of heavy cream, so, if necessary, thin with
  more stock. Sprinkle with remaining sesame seeds just before serving.

      4    Chiles mulatos
      2    Chiles anchos
      3    Chiles pasillas
    1/4 c  Shortening (lard if you're
           -being traditional)
           ;Water, warm, to cover

MMMMM--------------------------CHICKEN-------------------------------
      1    Chicken, 4 lb
      4 tb Shortening (or lard)
      1 sm Carrot; sliced
      1 sm Onion; sliced
      1    Garlic clove; peeled
      1 tb Salt
      3    Peppercorns
           ;Water to cover
    1/2 c  ;Water
    1/4 c  Shortening (or lard)
    1/4 c  Tomatillos; drained
      2    Cloves
      5    Peppercorns
    1/2    In Cinnamon stick
    1/8 ts Cilantro seeds and
    1/8 ts Aniseed, toasted together
    1/2 tb Reserved chili seeds,
           -toasted separately
      3 tb Sesame seeds, toasted
      2    Garlic cloves, toasted
      3 tb Shortening
      1 tb Raisins
     10    Almonds, unblanched
      1 oz Pumpkin seeds
      1    Corn tortilla, stale
      3    Croutons stale French bread
      1 oz Mexican chocolate
      2 c  Chicken stock
 
  The day before, slit the chiles open with a knife and remove the
  seeds and veins, reserving at least 1/2 tablespoon of the seeds. Heat
  the shortening and quickly fry the chiles on both sides. Take care
  that they do not burn, and be careful how you inhale the fumes,
  unless you want a seared windpipe. Put the chiles into a bowl, cover
  them with water, and leave them to stand overnight.
  
  On serving day:  preheat the oven to 325 F.  Cut the chicken into
  serving pieces.  Set the giblets aside. Melt 3 tablespoons lard and
  brown the chicken pieces well. Drain off the excess fat. Cover the
  pan and braise the chicken in the oven, without liquid, until it is
  tender---40 to 60 minutes, depending on toughness. Put the giblets
  into the pan with the rest of the ingredients.  Cover them with water
  and bring them to a boil. Lower the flame and simmer for 1-1/4 to
  1-1/2 hours. Strain the broth and set it aside.
  
  When the chicken is cooked, pour off the juices in the pan and set
  them aside to cool, then skim off the fat and add them to the giblet
  broth. Set it aside.  Blend the chiles with the water until
  smooth---you may have to do them in two or three lots but try not to
  add more water. Melt the shortening, and when it is hot but not
  smoking, cook the chili puree over a medium flame for about 10
  minutes, stirring it all the time. Keep a lid handy, as it will
  splatter about. Set it aside. Put the tomatillos in a blender or food
  processor.
  
  Put the spices into a spice grinder and add the toasted, cooled seeds,
  reserving 2 tablespoons of the sesame seeds for later use. Grind the
  spices and seeds finely and transfer them to the blender jar. Add the
  toasted garlic to the blender jar.
  
  Melt three tablespoons of shortening in the frying pan and fry the
  raisins briefly, just until they puff up, and transfer them with a
  slotted spoon to the blender jar. In the same pan fry the almonds,
  stirring them all the time, until they are well browned.  Remove with
  a slotted spoon and crush them a little before adding them to the
  blender jar. In the same pan fry the pumpkin seeds lightly, but have
  a lid handy, as they pop about explosively.  Remove with a slotted
  spoon and add to the blender. In the same pan fry the tortilla until
  very crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and crush it a little before
  adding it to the blender. In the same pan fry the bread until crisp,
  then remove with a slotted spoon and crush. Add it to the blender
  jar. Blend all the ingredients together until they form a smooth
  paste. If it is absolutely necessary to add some liquid to blend it
  effectively, then add a little chicken broth.
  
  Add the blended mixture to the chile sauce and cook over a brisk
  flame for about five minutes, stirring the mixture constantly. Break
  the chocolate into small pieces and add it to the mixture. Continue
  cooking the _mole_ for about 10 minutes more, stirring it all the
  time so it does not stick. Add the broth and continue cooking the
  _mole_ for a minimum of 40 minutes. Add salt as necessary, then add
  the chicken pieces and heat them through. Serve individually,
  sprinkled with some of the reserved toasted sesame seeds.

      Title: MOLE POBLANO PICANTE
 Categories: Poultry, Soups/stews, Mexican, Chocolate
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8    Mulato chiles
      4    Ancho chiles
      4    Pasilla chiles
      8 lb Turkey, in pieces
      4 tb Lard
      4 tb Sesame seeds
      1 lg Onion, chopped
      2    Cloves garlic, chopped
      1    Tortilla, cut up
      1 c  Blanched almonds
    1/8 ts Ground gloves
    1/8 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Ground coriander seed
    1/4 ts Anise
    1/2 c  Raisins
      3    Tomatoes, seeded, chopped
      4    Canned chipotle chiles
      2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
      1 ts Sugar
 
  Prepare the mulato, ancho, and pasilla chiles by washing in cold
  water; removing veins, stems, and seeds; and tearing them roughly
  into pieces. Place the pieces in a bowl and soak in hot water (about
  1 cup to 6 chiles) for about an hour. Blend the chiles with the
  soaking water in a blender, but do not over blend. The texture should
  remain coarse.
  
  Place the turkey pieces in a flameproof casserole with a lid, and
  poach, covered, in salted water to barely cover for 1 hour. Drain,
  reserving the stock. Dry the turkey pieces thoroughly with paper
  towels. Heat the lard in a skillet, and brown the turkey pieces, a
  few at a time. Arrange the turkey pieces in the casserole and keep
  warm. Combine 2 tbs of the sesame seeds, the onion, garlic, tortilla,
  almonds, cloves, cinnamon, coriander seed, anise, raisins, tomatoes,
  prepared chiles, and chipotle chiles, and reduce, bit by bit, to a
  coarse puree in the electric blender.
  
  Heat the remaining lard in a skillet, adding, if necessary, a little
  more lard to bring it up to 3 TBS. Cook the puree, stirring
  constantly, for about 5 minutes. Add 2 cups of the turkey stock,
  chocolate, salt and pepper to taste, and the sugar, and cook, over
  very low heat, until the chocolate has melted. Pour the sauce over
  the turkey; cover; and cook over the lowest possible heat for 1 hour,
  stirring occasionally. The sauce should be rather thicker than the
  consistency of heavy cream. If it seems too thin, thin with turkey
  stock. Sprinkle with remaining sesame seeds just before serving.
  
  NOTE: Chipotle chile and its close relative morita chile have the most
  exotic flavor of any of the Mexican chiles. They are also exceedingly
  picante and can really lift your head off. If you do not care for hot
  food, experiment with the chipotle, for even in a small quantity its
  flavor will survive. Begin with a half chile, tasting and adding more
  to your mole with caution until you find the amount that suits your
  taste.

  De-vein chiles and remove seeds. Peel onion and cut in quarters. Cut
  plaintain banana in 1/4 inch pieces. Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a pan
  and fry all ingredients in batches, starting with the chiles and
  ending with the nuts, tomatoes and chocolate. As you fry all the
  ingredients, set them aside. Puree them in a blender, thinning them
  with chicken broth. Consistency should be fairly thick, but just thin
  enough to blend to a smooth sauce. Cook over low flame for two hours,
  or until Mole turns a dark reddish brown colour. Serve over chicken
  or turkey, accompanied by Mexican rice and corn tortillas.

           ;Salt to taste

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE GARNISH---------------------------
      2 c  Sesame seeds; toasted
 
   Seeded, deveined, roasted or lightly fried, and soaked. Reserve some
  of the soaking water or water/vinegar mixture.
  
     Prepare the spices: Heat a little lard in a large, deep saucepan.
  Fry halved onion until transparent and lightly browned. Add garlic
  cloves, and brown. Remove garlic. Reserve. Add more lard, and fry
  sesame seeds, almonds, peanuts, raisins, prunes, plantains, coriander
  seed, anise, and cinnamon. Remove. Drain all fried ingredients on
  paper towels. Put fried ingredients, croissant, tortillas, and broth
  in a blender or food processor, and blend thoroughly. It will be
  necessary to blend in batches.
     Heat remaining lard, and brown onion slices.  Add blended
  ingredients and salt.  Simmer over low heat for 1 hour, stirring
  occasionally.
     Meanwhile, prepare the chiles: Blend chiles mulatos, anchos,
  pasillas, and chipotle in a blender or food processor with onion,
  garlic, and a little reserved soaking water. Salt. Strain chile
  mixture, and gruadually stir into the simmering spice mixture,
  waiting about 10 minutes between each addition. Continue to heat
  mole, stirring occasionally. Add chocolate and sugar.  Add salt if
  necessary.
     Simmer mole for 2 to 3 hours.  Cover saucepan with lid or aluminum
  foil to avoid splattering.  The mole also can be prepared outdoors on
  a brazier to avoid splattering or over firewood, which gives the
  sauce a rustic flavor.  Add broth until the mole is slightly thick.
  The mole is ready when it is very thick, with a thick top layer of
  fat. Taste, and add more salt if necessary.
     Prepare the chicken: Heat water in a large stock pot. Add chicken,
  onions, garlic, carrots, celery, bay leaves, and salt. Cook over low
  heat for 30 minutes. Cool chicken in broth. Then add chicken pieces
  to the mole sauce, and cook for 30 minutes.
     Serve mole, garnished with toasted sesame seeds, from a clay pot,
  or serve on individual plates, sprinkling sesame seeds over the
  mole-covered chicken. This dish often is served with red rice,
  frijoles de oila, and freshly made tortillas.
     This mole recipe will yild more sauce than necessary for one meal.
  Use extra sauce to accent fried or poached eggs or in stuffings for
  enmoladas, mole-chicken pie, or chicken crepes with cheese and cream.
  It is an excellent complement to rice.  The mole sauce freezes well.

      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      6    Eggs
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      1 tb Baking powder
      1 tb Vanilla
      4 oz Raisins (1 small box)
      4    Apples
      1 lb Muller's Wide Egg
           -Noodles (one box)
      4 oz Butter (1 stick)
           Cinnamon (for top)
 
  Peel the apples and and slice them into small wedges.
  
  Beat the eggs until they are foamy, add the sugar gradually and beat
  well.
  
  Cook the noodles according to package directions. Drain.
  
  Melt the butter in a 9x13 metal baking pan.  Swirl it around to coat
  the pan, and then pour the excess butter into the egg mixture. Add
  baking powder and vanilla to egg mixture, mix well, and then slowly
  add drained noodles, apples and raisins. Mix thoroughly until all the
  noodles have been coated and look gooey.
  
  Pour the egg/noodle mixture into the metal pan, top with cinnamon if
  you desire, and bake at 425 degrees F. for about 45 minutes to an
  hour, or until the top looks a little brown and crispy. The kugel
  should feel springy to the touch and not be "wet." Let cool, cut into
  squares and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Egg noodles, raisins, cinnamon and apples.  Yield: Serves 12.
  
  *  This feeds about 12 very hungry people (knoshers, as we call them)
  or 16 normal ones.  What you don't eat right away you can wrap in
  aluminum foil and freeze for a month or two. If it's too sweet for
  your taste, you can use peaches or other fruit instead of the raisins.
  
  *  Warning:  this stuff sits very heavy in the ol' stomach, so don't
  try to eat more than 2 pieces in a 24-hour period.
  
  *  Don't thank me, thank my mom.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.

 Categories: Desserts, Mom, Cathe
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      3 c  Almonds, ground
           -(1 lb)
      4 c  Walnuts or pecans,
           -ground (1 lb)
    3/4 c  Sugar
    3/4 c  Water
      1    Cinnamon stick
  1 1/2 c  Honey
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 ts Lemon peel, grated
      2 ts Cinnamon, ground
  1 1/2 c  Butter, melted
      1 lb Filo, thawed
 
  Spread nuts in a shallow baking pan and toast at 300 degrees F. for 10
  minutes or until lightly browned. Cool.
  
  Combine 3/4 C sugar, water and cinnamon stick in a saucepan. Boil
  until clear.  Add honey and heat until well-blended. Cool and remove
  cinnamon stick.
  
  Combine 1/2 C sugar, lemon peel, and ground cinnamon in a large mixing
  bowl.  Mash together with back of a spoon to blend citrus oil with
  sugar. Add cooled toasted nuts and mix well.
  
  Butter a 9x13 inch pan.  Line it with 3 sheets of filo, each of which
  has been brushed with melted butter. Let filo overlap sides of pan.
  Sprinkle with 1/2 cup of nut mixture. Repeat, alternating 2 sheets of
  buttered filo and nut mixture, ending with filo. (After the second
  set of sheets overlap the edges of the pan, start folding the sheets
  in half after they are buttered.  They will fit almost perfectly in
  the pan.)
  
  After you put in the final sheet of filo, fold the filo that has been
  hanging off the pan back onto the top sheet of filo so you have a
  neat, sealed package. Using a razor blade or very sharp knife, cut
  through the top layer of filo, making lengthwise strips 1 1/2 inches
  wide. Cut diagonally, making diamonds.
  
  Bake at 325 degrees F. for 1 hour or until golden brown. Remove from
  oven, place pan on rack, and quickly cut pieces through completely.
  Immediately pour cooled honey syrup over the baklava. Stop when you
  run out of syrup or when the baklava stops sizzling when the syrup
  hits it. This will help keep it crispy and keep it from becoming
  soggy. Cool and serve. Makes about 4 dozen pieces.

  This is a wonderful recipe that I got from a cookbook called Lean
  Luscious & meatless.  It takes a little bit of time to prepare but is
  well worth the effort. It is the best baked beans I have ever had.
  You can substitute baby limas for the navy beans. I have changed a
  few things from the original recipe to suit my own taste so feel free
  to add any of your favorite seasonings. Rinse & drain beans. Place in
  a large bowl with remaining ingredients except tomato sauce. Mix well
  cover & place in the refigerator for 24 hours. TO COOK: Transfer bean
  mixture to a large oven proof pot. Add tomato sauce. Bring to a boil
  over medium heat. Reduce heat to low, cover & simmer 45 min stirring
  occassionally. Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Place pot in oven. bake 4
  hours covered. Check beans every half hour or so adding water and
  stirring as needed. When beans are done to your likeness remove from
  oven and serve. : Nutrition (per serving): 283 calories Total Fat 1 g

 Categories: Poultry, Mom
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Chicken
      1 ts Garlic salt
      5 c  Flour
      3 lg Eggs
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Pepper
 
  Cook hen in pressure cooker with lots of salt and MSG, plus 1 teaspoon
  garlic salt.  (If you don't use MSG, just omit it instead of
  lecturing me, okay?)  Cover chicken with water and close. Place 15-lb
  weight on top and cook over medium-high heat.  When the weight starts
  "popping" 2 to 3 times a minute, cook 15 minutes. Cool the chicken
  and de-bone.
  
  Mix flour, salt, 1/2 teaspoon MSG and a little less than 1/2 teaspoon
  baking powder.  Blend eggs with 1 1/4 Cup *cool* chicken stock from
  pot (1/3 of it should be fat). Stir into flour a little at a time. On
  flour-covered board, knead dough and roll it out till thinner than a
  nickel.  Cut dumplings (about 2 inches wide by 10 inches, or however
  long possible). Stack well-floured dumplings onto plate.
  
  In large pot, bring the rest of the stock to a boil over medium-high
  heat. Add the chunks of chicken alternately with the dumplings;
  quickly pushing them below the surface of the liquid as you add them.
  DON'T FOLD THE DUMPLINGS!
  
  Keep mixture boiling at all times.  Lower heat; cover and cook for
  12-15 minutes.  Don't lift the lid for the first 10 minutes.
  
  Add 1 teaspoon pepper to broth --> might need to add additional stock
  during the cooking process.

      Title: MOM'S CHILI
 Categories: Entrees
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Ground beef
      2 lg Yellow onions,
           -chopped
      1 lb Kidney beans
    1/2 lb Tomato paste
      6 oz Water
      3    Garlic cloves
           -(or more, to taste)
      1    Bay leaf
           Ketchup (1 "glub")
      1 tb Chili powder
           -(or more to taste)
 
  Brown the meat and onions, separately if desired.  In a large, heavy
  pot, combine the meat and onions, and the other ingredients except
  the chili powder.  Simmer at least one hour. Six or more hours is
  better. Stir in the chili powder.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A mild, hearty chili -- This chili won't win any awards in Texas,
  but it's a nice, mild, flavorful dish. The recipe can easily be
  multiplied; I usually make a triple batch and freeze the excess. For
  a spicier chili, use more chili powder, or, even better, mix your own
  spices. Yield: Serves 4-5.
  
  *  I usually use more garlic; the cloves can be left whole and will
  become soft and mildly flavored by simmering.
  
  *  The flavor is best if the chili sits for a day before being served.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 to 6 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

  These rolls have alot of layers due to how thin the dough is rolled

  margarine and add 1 cup sugar and beat really, really well till very
  creamy. Add to eggs and beat till very well blended and add salt.
  
  Add egg mixture to sponge mixture.  Add approximately four to 5 cups
  flour and beat with a beater really well till smooth. Continue adding
  flour until smooth to stir put the rest of the flour on a board and
  put the dough in the middle and knead. (You don't have to knead in
  all the flour-only until not sticky and easy to handle.
  
  Put the dough in a warm oven and cover with a damp cloth. Let rise
  until doubled (about 1 hour.)
  
  Fix pans for Rolls.  Grease 2 large rectangular baking pans with
  margarine. Sprinkle liberally (not packed) (1/4" deep) with brown
  sugar and dot liberally with butter (1 stick per pan) Sprinkle very
  lightly with water to keep the sugar from burning and sticking.
  
  Punch down dough and let rise 1/2 hour more.  Turn out and take 1/2
  of the dough and roll out to 1/2" thick rectangle.
  
  Spread with soft butter (over all of rectangle) and sprinkle with
  sugar and cinnamon.  Roll up jelly roll style, pulling to stretch
  dough while rolling.  Cut roll into 1" thick slices. Place in
  pan-just touching (don't crowd)  let rise (covered with a damp cloth)
  until above the pans. Bake at 325-350 for 20-25 min.

      1 lb Boneless chicken breasts
    1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Basil
    1/2 ts Parsley
    1/2 ts Dill
      1    Egg
    1/2 c  Milk
           Flour to dredge
 
  Mix the egg and milk together and set aside. Preheat oven to 300-325F.
  Prepare the meat as if it were a shish-ka-bob; that is, alternate the
  meats and place on a 10" skewer. Dredge the meat in the egg/milk
  mixture, then the flour, and put into a non-stick baking dish.
  Sprinkle the spices ontop. (You might want to coat the dish with a
  non-stick spray first). Bake at 300-325 degrees (a slow oven) for
  about 2 1/2 ~ 3 hours, or until the meat is browned on all sides and
  very tender. If you wish, serve this with gravy. It is very filling
  and very good.

      Title: MOM'S COLESLAW
 Categories: Salads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      8 c  Finely shredded green
           -cabbage
      1 c  Mayonnaise
    1/2 c  Red wine Vinegar
      2 ts Sugar
      1 tb Dijon-type mustard
    1/4 c  Finely grated carrots
    1/8 c  Finely chopped parsley and
           -chives
    1/8 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
 
  I'm NOT a coleslaw fan, but this one by Jeff Cox looks promising.
  
  The secret seems to be soaking the cabbage in ice cold water for a
  couple of hours.
  
  Remove outer leaves from cabbage, then core.  Cut heads into quarters
  and soak in cold water in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours. Shake
  off excess water and shred very finely, then pat shreds dry with
  towels. Place the shreds in a bowl and mix in all other ingredients.
  Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour before serving.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

 Categories: Candies, Desserts, Mom
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 c  Sugar, granulated
      1 tb Karo, light
      1 lg Egg white
    1/2 c  Pecans, broken
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract (or more)
    1/4 c  Water
 
  Cook only on a DRY day!
  
  In heavy-bottom pan over medium heat, boil syrup of sugar, water and
  Karo till close to done (about 10 minutes); will spin a thread to
  pot. Take candy off heat.
  
  Beat egg white with a pinch of salt till you have stiff peaks. In a
  large bowl, add the hot syrup to the beaten egg white while mixing at
  a high speed.  If syrup starts to harden, pour a little more. When
  mixture gets stiffer and warmer, can add in a larger stream.
  
  Add vanilla extract to candy.  Stir by hand until texture dulls
  (seems like it takes FOREVER).  When cool, add nuts (if you add them
  too soon, the heat pulls the oil out of the nuts and the candy won't
  harden). Drop by tablespoons onto waxed paper.
  
  To expand the recipe, use no less than 2 cups of sugar; if you
  quadruple, add an extra egg white, especially if eggs are small.
  Might try stirring in 3 oz. of broken white chocolate before dropping
  candy (won't melt).

  Turn duck upside-down and prick through the skin into the fat all
  over the bottom of the duck so the fat will drain. Preheat oven to
  350 degrees F. Bake the duck in a little water around 30 minutes.
  (Grab a leg; if it moves, it is tender enough.)  Keep duck covered
  with foil, but baste often.
  
  Make the glaze of equal parts marmalade and orange juice concentrate,
  thawed.  Can add a little sugar to make it stick better; glaze is
  prettier if you add about 1 T cornstarch dissolved in a little water.

      2 lb Ground beef

    1/2 ts -Pepper

    1/2 md Onion; small dice
           -Boiling water
           -Flour;  for dredging
           -Fat; for cooking

MMMMM-------------------------FOR SAUCE------------------------------
      1 qt -Water
      1 c  Catsup
      1 tb -Flour
      4 tb Cornstartch
      1 tb Vinegar
      1 tb Sugar
      1 ts -Salt
           -Pepper; to taste
           -Water; to make thin cream
 
  This is a bit of a task to prepare, but well worth the effort. The
  recipe was passed down for many generations in my husbands family who
  immigrated here from Russia (being Russian Jews) so, I have no idea
  why they called it 'German' meatballs, but a meatball by any other
  name...I guess! Put the garlic into a water glass and pour 2 T
  boiling water over it. Mash the garlic well, then add 2 T. more
  boiling water. Strain through a kitchen towel, saving the liquid
  only. Mix together all the ingredients, including garlic liquid then
  shape into balls about the size of a large egg. Roll the balls in the
  flour until well coated. Melt enough fat to make about 1/2" in a
  heavy skillet or cast iron cooking pot. Brown the meat balls in the
  fat. Remove the meatballs and pour off all but 4 T. of the fat.
  SAUCE: Add the qt. of water to the reserved fat along with thecatsup.
  Make a paste of the sauce ingredients, stirring in the water to get a
  consistency of a thin cream. After the water-catsup mixture is warm,
  slowly add this mixture, stirring constantly to avoid lumping, until
  the mixture has been well absorbed into the liquid. Cook gently until
  the sauce is slightly thickened. Place meatball in the pan, or in an
  oven-proof roaster and make sure they are covered with the sauce.
  Cover pan and bake in hot oven for 1 hour. Serve with mashed
  potatoes. (My friends also love it with pasta or rice!)

  This is the recipe I promised to send.  It is a bit of a task to
  prepare, but well worth the effort.  The recipe was passed down for
  many generations in my husbands family who immigrated here from
  Russia (being Russian Jews) so, I have no idea why they called it
  'German' meatballs, but a meatball by any other name...I guess! >>>>
  Slice the garlic into a water glass and pour 2 T boiling water over
  it.  Mash the garlic well, then add 2 T. more boiling water.  Strain
  through a kitchen towel, saving the liquid only. Mix together all the
  ingredients, including garlic liquid then shape into balls about the
  size of a large egg. Roll the balls in the flour until well coated.
  Melt enough fat to make about 1/2" in a heavy skillet or cast iron
  cooking pot.  Brown the meat balls in the fat. Remove the meatballs
  and pour off all but 4 T. of the fat. Sauce and balance of cooking
  instructions follow next page: Ingredients: SAUCE:  Add 1 qt. water
  to the reserved fat along with the catsup. Make a paste of the next
  six ingredients, then mix in enough water to get a consistency of a
  thin cream. After the water-catsup mixture is warm, slowly add this
  mixture, stirring constantly to avoid lumping, until the mixture has
  been well absorbed into the liquid. Cook gently until the sauce is
  slightly thickened. Place meatball in the pan, or in an oven-proof
  roaster and make sure they are covered with the sauce.  Cover pan and
  bake in hot oven for 1 hour. Serve with mashed potatoes. (My friends
  also love it with pasta or rice!) Enjoy! Barbara Manhattan Beach, Ca

      Title: MOM'S HOMEMADE APPLE PIE
 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 lg Macintosh apples, sliced
    1/2 c  Light brown sugar
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      2 ts Cinnamon
      1 ts Allspice
      1 ts Nutmeg
           CRUST:
      2 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
    1/4 c  Milk
      5 ds Salt
 
  Prepare the crust by mixing the flour, oil, milk, and salt. Separate
  into two balls, and put each between 2 pieces of wax paper to roll
  out, as the crust will be very flaky. Make bottom crust and place in
  8-9 inch pie plate, depending upon size you want.
  
  Preheat the oven to 425 F
  
  In a large bowl, put the apples, sugar, and spices. Cut through with a
  knife to create the appearance of chopped apples. Put mixture in pie
  plate, and dot with a few pats of butter and a few teaspoons of flour.
  
  Roll top crust out, and put on pie. Slit the pie, and put in oven. Be
  sure to put a lining underneath the pie or a cookie sheet as the pie
  is sure to run over. Bake at 425 degrees for 10 minutes, and then
  reduce oven heat to 350 and bake for 50 minutes or until both top and
  bottom crusts are brown.
  
  Remove from oven and cool on wire rack. Prepare the following glaze:
  
  3/4 cup confectioners' sugar 1/2 tsp vanilla milk to make a glaze
  
  While the pie is still hot, brush this glaze on top of the pie and be
  sure that the glaze drips into the slits.
  
  Cool, and serve with vanilla ice cream or fresh whipped cream.
  
  This recipe comes from my mother-in-law who worked in a bakery in
  Kilkeel, County Down, Northern Ireland in the 1940's. It is the
  flakiest crust you will ever make.

  Place raw ham shank in big pot of water.  Heat to boiling, reduce and
  simmer until done, about one hour (consult cooking chart per weight).
  Cool. De-skin, remove fat and bone. In the process, you will cut off
  some of the lesser-quality meat; will have 2-4 chunks of meat.
  
  (Save scraps and strain fat off top of water; the meat and pot liquor
  is great for cooking black beans.)
  
  Put whole peppercorns and water in blender; grind until pureed, till
  you have about 1/4 cup.  Coat all sides of the ham chunks (not ends).
  Put in 300 - 325 degree oven to dry. Chill and slice as thinly as

    1/2 c  Milk, warm
           OR
    1/2 c  Water
      1    Egg
      1    Egg Yolk
      2 tb Sour cream
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Butter (Optional)
 
  Mix all ingredients and knead into a soft, pliable dough.  Let rest
  for 10 minutes, covered in a warm bowl.  The kneading should only be
  about 15 or 20 minutes.  We haven't used a pasta maker on this, but
  that should work.
  
  Divide dough in half.  Roll thing, about 1/8 inch.  Cut into 2 inch
  squares or use a large round biscuit cutter.  Take a piece and
  stretch lightly. Place a small spoonfull of filling in it.  Fold
  dough over and carefully seal the edges.  A bit of water on the edge
  helps make a good seal.
  
  Place completed pierogis in salted boiling water.  Cook for about 5
  minutes, or until they float.  Remove gently with a slotted spoon.
  
  Place in a pan with melted butter and onions.  Allow to brown, if you
  want. They are good either way.
  
  They are great the first day.  Even better if you have some left over
  the following day, either cold or re-fried.  I like them best the
  second day when they are browned.

      2 lg Eggs
      1 tb Butter, melted
 
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Grease 2 heavy (cast iron) muffin
  pans and put in oven to get hot.

  CLOSED WHILE BAKING!
  
  VARIATIONS:
  
  *  Daddy substitutes meat juice from roasts for the milk (like
  Yorkshire Pudding).  Don't add salt; if there is any fat in the
  juice, that should go toward the tablespoon of butter.
  
  *  For a cheese version, add 1 more egg and 2 T more butter. When
  water sizzles on hot pan, pour 1 T batter into each cup and sprinkle
  each with 1 teaspoon shredded cheddar; fill cups with rest of batter
  till 3/4 full. (Uses a total of 1/4 C cheese.)
  
  *  For a variation with pecans, add 1/3 C, chopped. Cook at 475
  degrees for 15 minutes, then at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.
  
  *  For eggnog popovers, add 1 T dry, instant eggnog, 1 T rum and 1/4 t
  nutmeg.  (For only 6 popovers.) Follow cooking instructions for
  Caraway Rye Popovers...
  
  *  Caraway Rye:  Decrease flour, substitute w/ 1/4 C rye flour. Add
  1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds.  (For only 6 popovers.) Cook at 400
  degrees just till crusts are very firm; prick with fork to let steam
  escape and return to oven (turned off) 5-10 minutes to crisp.

    1/2 ts Paprika
 
  Brown the hamburger in a pan or at the bottom of the pressure cooker.
  Add salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder to taste. Add the
  tomato sauce, water, chili powder and paprika. Stir well. Mount the
  lid on the pressure cooker and bring to full pressure. Let the gauge
  rock for 10 minutes slowly. Bring pressure down immediately by
  immersing in water or letting water run over the top of the cooker.
  Remove lid and add entire can of chili beans. Place on stove at
  low-medium heat until mixture heats thoroughly. Makes enough for 4
  people with lots of leftovers. (It tastes even better reheated the
  next day, we think!) Serve with crackers or biscuits. If you use a
  crock-pot instead: Follow basic directions, putting all ingredients
  except chili beans together in the pot. Let cook about 7-8 hours. Add
  the chili beans in the last 2 hours or so. If you don't have time for
  that, you can cook it all in the pot, then transfer it to a stock pot
  before adding the chili beans. Heat that on the stove for a few
  minutes. From: Pat Stockett Date: Tue, 10-0

  ID#GDDF80A and she got it from SWEET INSPIRATIONS SUGAR FREE DESSERT
  COOKBOOK. To make fruit sweetner - cook four cups of fruit juice
  until it is reduced to one cup. If you like it sweeter add Sweet One.
  OR if a recipe calls for 1/2 cup fruit sweetner, use 1/2 cup frozen
  fruit juice plus half as much (1/4 cup) granulated fructose. ~ Sherry
  adds Sweet One instead to desired sweetness. If 2/3 cup is called for
  use 2/3 cup concentrate plus 1/3 cup granulated fructose. Commercial
  fruit sweeteners are available at health food stores. Good juices to
  use are apple, orange, pineapple, pineapple- orange, and grape.

     12 c  Water
      6 ts Celery salt
      1    Head garlic -- peeled and
           Crushed
      6 ts Salt
      2 ts Ground black pepper
      1 ts Louisiana Hot sauce

      6 tb Fresh lemon juice
           Zest from the lemons
      3 tb Apple cider vinegar
           Catsup -- (about 12 cups)
 
  Combine ingredients, stirring to blend.  Simmer for about an hour
  before using or canning to allow it to thicken. Charcoal broil or
  cook in a pit meat or chicken until done. Cover with sauce and keep
  warm until ready to serve.  Is best if meat can marinate for at least
  30 minutes before serving.
  
  Note:  You can get pretty comparable results from a Weber grill and
  mesquite chips, as Bill's Barbecue was always smoked with mequite.
  Daddy always said that you had to use Lea and Perrins Worcestershire
  Sauce -- other brands made the sauce taste funny. This recipe made my
  parents a fine living for many years before they retired, in the
  highly competitive world of Texas Barbecue. Rosilyn H. Overton

      Title: MONDEL BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Cakes, Desserts=7f
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Sugar
      3    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Oil
  1 1/2 c  Walnuts or pecans
    1/2 ts Baking powder
      2 c  Flour
 
  Mix sugar and eggs in Mix Master.  Add the oil. Remove from the mixer
  and proced by hand.  Add [finely chopped] nuts into the mixture and
  add the other ingredients into the mixture with a wooden spoon.
  Mixture must not be too soft not too stiff so you can roll it into a
  salami shape.
  
  Place rolls on a cookie sheet in a 350 [f] oven until golden brown.
  Remove from the oven and cut into diagonal slices. Return to oven for
  about 15-20 minutes.
  
  I find that I have to chill it over night and add flour to each roll
  so it will stand up as a roll and not flatten out-sometimes as much
  as a cup or even more depending on the size of the eggs. Submitted By

           -recipe at end)
    1/4 c  Hot pepper oil
    1/4 c  Sesame oil
      2 tb Garlic paste ***
 
  From: Kyosho Connick This first is from The People's Republic of China
  Cookbook, _Mongolian_Barbecue_ A truly native meal, typical of the
  diet of the rugged Mongolian nomad. The thin-sliced meat is dipped in
  a spicy sauce, quickly grilled and then wrapped in a sesame roll. A
  gruel-like millet soup is eaten between sandwiches, and the meal is
  topped off with draughts of heated sorghum whiskey. Transposed to the
  West, this meal is ideal for an outdoor barbecue.
  
  Millet soup:
  
  * Ask the butcher to bone a leg of lamb.  Use the bones to make the
  soup and freeze the shank portion for later use. ** Smash 5 large
  slices of fresh ginger with the end of a cleaver handle and put them
  in 1/2 cup water for 2 hours.  Squeeze out the juice from the ginger
  slices. *** Peel and crush 4 large garlic cloves into a paste, and
  add a little rice wine or vinegar to moisten.
  
  Soak the millet overnight in cold water.  The next morning, put the
  lamb bones in a large pot.  Add water and bring to a boil. Reduce the
  heat and simmer for several hours, adding water to maintain the
  original volume. Skim off the fat, remove the bones and strain the
  stock. Drain the millet, rinse several times, add to the stock and
  simmer slowly for 1 to 2 hours, or until the grains break up and the
  soup is thickened. Salt to taste. Turn off the heat and set aside.
  While the stock is simmering, trim off all fat and skin from the beef
  and lamb. Wrap the meat well and place in the freezer for 2 to 3
  hours, or until it becomes firm, but not frozen hard. (This makes it
  easier to slice the meat very thinly.) Using a very sharp knife or
  cleaver, carefully cut against the grain of the meat to make slices
  about 1/8 inch thick.  Cut each slice into strips about 2 by 4
  inches.  Arrange the beef and lamb in layers on separate platters.
  Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Put the green onion and
  parsley in separate bowls, cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
  Put each dip ingredient in a separate bowl, place the bowls on a
  large tray, cover and set aside.  Prepare the rolls.

 Categories: Oriental, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 lb Boneless lean lamb
      4 oz Bean thread noodles
    1/2 lb Spinach
    1/2 lb Chinese cabbage
      1 qt Chicken stock
      1 ts Finely chopped ginger root
      2 tb Finely chopped scallions
      1 ts Minced garlic
      1 tb Finely chopped cilantro

MMMMM-----------------------DIPPING SAUCE----------------------------
      2 tb Sesame paste
           -=OR=- peanut butter
      1 tb Light soy sauce
      1 tb Rice wine or dry sherry
      2 ts Chili bean sauce
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Hot water
 
  USING A CLEAVER or sharp knife, slice the lamb into very thin slices.
  Soak the noodles in warm water for 5 minutes, then drain them and cut
  them into 5-inch lengths. Separate the spinach leaves from the stalks
  and wash them well. Discard the stalks. Cut the Chinese cabbage into
  3-inch pieces. Combine all the ingredients for the dipping sauce in a
  small bowl and mix them well. Each guest should have his or her own
  small portion of dipping sauce and a plate containing lamb, spinach
  and Chinese cabbage. When you are ready to begin, bring the stock to
  a boil and light the fondue. Ladle the stock into the fondue pot and
  put the ginger, scallions, garlic and coriander into the stock. Each
  person selects a piece of food and cooks it quickly in the pot. When
  all the meat and vegetables have been eaten, add the noodles to the
  pot, let them heat through, then ladle the soup into soup bowls. This
  dish also works successfully with other foods such as steak, fish
  balls, oysters, shrimp, squid, mushrooms and lettuce, although it
  will no longer be a Mongolian Hot Pot, but more like the Cantonese
  Chrysanthemum Pot.

      Title: MONKEY BREAD - COOKING LIGHT *JB
 Categories: Breads, Desserts, Low-fat
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
      2    Loaves (1-pound) frozen
           -white bread dough
      1 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Firmly packed brown sugar
    1/4 c  1% low-fat milk
      1 tb Reduced-calorie stick
           -margarine
  1 1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
           Vegetable cooking spray
 
  1 Because the dough has a tendency to drip as it bakes, I usually put
  a cookie sheet or aluminum foil underneath the Bundt pan. That way I
  don't have to clean up a mess in the oven when the bread has finished
  baking. -- Rita M. Newton, Waukon, Iowa
  
  2 Thaw dough in refrigerator for 12 hours. Combine 1 cup sugar and
  the next 4 ingredients in a small saucepan; bring to a boil, and cook
  1 minute. Remove sugar syrup from heat; let cool 10 minutes.
  
  3 Cut each loaf of dough into 24 equal portions. Combine 1/4 cup
  sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a shallow dish; stir well. Roll
  each portion in sugar mixture, and layer dough in a 12-cup Bundt pan
  coated with cooking spray. Pour sugar syrup over dough; cover and let
  rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 35 minutes or
  until doubled in bulk.
  
  4 Uncover, and bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes or until lightly
  browned. Immediately loosen edges of bread with a knife. Place a
  serving plate, upside down, on top of the pan, and invert bread onto
  the plate. Remove the pan, and drizzle any remaining syrup over the
  bread.

 Categories: Main
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           SEE DIRECTIONS:
 
  The pork is sliced, and then marinated in 7-up. That's right, 7-up.
  She says that if you want, you can add a little garlic and/or onion
  to the marinade.  The pork is then skewered and grilled, basting with
  soy sauce while cooking.  The MSG is an ingredient that I'd add, but
  may not be for everyone.
  
  It sounds bizarre, but the 7-up would give a citrusy taste like the
  lemon juice you mentioned.
  
  I gotta try this one.

  1 1/2 lb Monkfish

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE MARINADE---------------------------
           Juice of a lemon
      4 tb Olive oil
      1    Clove of garlic
           Salt and Pepper
      1 ts Freeze-dried rosemary or
           -Fresh sprigs
 
  Cut fish into 1 inch cubes. wash pepper and deseed it. Cut into 1 inch
  pieces. To make marinade, mix olive oil, lemon juice, crushed clove of
  garlic and rosemary in a glass or china bowl. Do not use metal. Add
  salt and pepper. Put in fish, turning occasionally. Keep in marinade
  in fridge for 90 minutes to 2 hours. It can stay in the marinade for
  up to six hours, but not longer. When you're ready to cook kebabs,
  put fish on to skewers, not more than 3 or 4 cubes on each skewer,
  with pieces of pepper between each cube. Begin and end with pepper.
  Make sure all the pieces touch, but don't squash together. Push all
  up to sharp end, leaving a long handle to hold easily under grill or
  on barbecue. Line grill with foil - saves washing up! - and grill for
  5 to 6 minutes a side. Do not put them too close to the heat - they
  will burn on the outside before they are cooked inside - these cubes
  are really meaty. They should take about 10 to 12 minutes to cook
  properly so they are succulent inside with wonderful borwn crispy
  bits on the outside. Serve with a rice pilau or even just crusty
  bread with some lemon juice to squeeze over them.

  approximately 5 minutes.) Place the dough in a very large buttered
  bowl, turn to butter the top, and allow to rise, covered loosely with
  a kitchen towel, in a warm place until doubled in bulk, approximately
  1 hour. Punch the dough down and roll out to a large rectangle,
  24x36". Butter two 9x13" glass baking dishes. Filling: Beat together
  the brown sugar, butter and cinnamon until well combined. Spread
  evenly over the surface of the dough. Roll up lengthwise and cut at
  2" intervals to make 12 rolls. Place 6 rolls in each buttered dish.
  Cover loosely with a kitchen towel and allow to rise until doubled in
  bulk, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350=B0. Bake the rolls for
  about 20-30 minutes or until puffed and browned. Cool to room
  temperature on racks. Frosting: , beat the cream cheese, cream and
  vanilla until well combined. Add the confectioner's sugar and beat
  until smooth and soft, not stiff. Frost the rolls and serve
  immediately. This makes 12 Large rolls.

      1 lb Marshmallows
    1/2 c  Peanut butter
      3 c  Puffed rice cereal
      1 c  Apricots; chopped
      1 c  Raisins
 
  In a large bowl, combine cereal, apricots, raisins and peanuts. In a
  microwave safe 13x9", melt butter and marshmallows on high for 2
  minutes. Stir; add peanut butter cook on high 2 minutes longer. Stir
  until well blended, add cereal mixture to dish and toss until well
  coated. Working quickly with greased hand, form into balls, using
  about 1/2 C mixture, per ball. If mixture begins to harden, cook on
  high for 30 seconds, or until softened. If desired , mixture may be
  spread in unbuttered 13x9" dish and cooled and cut into bars. Makes 1
  dozen balls or 2 dozen bars, This is very similar to the Rice Krispie
  treats, but with the apricaots and raisins it definitely gives it a
  fall look. I saw another idea of putting the mixture into cookie
  cutters, and letting it cool there so the shapes could be pumpkins,
  witches, etc. With a little gel piping they would be great.

    1/8 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Cream of tartar
      1 c  Less 1 tb sugar
    3/4 ts Vanilla

MMMMM-----------------------CHESTNUT PUREE----------------------------
      3 lb Fresh chestnuts or one 1lb
           -15 oz can chestnut puree
      1    Vanilla bean (if using fresh
           -chestnuts)
    3/4 c  Water
    1/3 c  Sugar

MMMMM-----------------------CREAM FILLING----------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
      1 tb (or 2) tb sugar
      1 ts Vanilla
      1    Egg white, room temp
      2    Squares semisweet chocolate
           -grated
 
  FOR MERINGUE: Preheat oven to 250 deg F. Grease a baking sheet,
  sprinkle with flour, and mark 1 9inch circle or 10 3.5 inch circles
  (this may require more than one baking sheet) In large bowl, beat egg
  whites with salt until foamy. Add cream of tartar and beat until soft
  peaks form. Beat in 2 tb sugar until mixture holds long, stiff peaks
  when beater is lifted. *Fold* in remaining sugar and vanilla. Place
  in pastry bag fitted with 1/2-inch plain tube and pipe 1 large round
  or 10 small ones onto prepared sheet. Bake 1 hour or until meringue
  is firm to the touch. If meringue(s) brown during baking, reduce
  heat. Transfer meringue(s) to rack and let cool. FOR CHESTNUT PUREE:
  Peel chestnuts using small, sharp knife and leaving inner skin.
  Preheat oven to 375 deg F. Place chestnuts in shallow heatproof dish
  and bake 10 to 15 minutes, or until skin dries and peels off easily.
  Rub nuts in rough cloth to remove skins. Place peeled nuts in
  saucepan with vanilla bean and water to cover and bring to a boil
  over high heat. Reduce heat, cover and simmer 25 to 30 minutes, or
  until very tender. Remove vanilla bean (it may be washed and reused.)
  Drain chestnuts, then put through food mill or sieve, or in food
  processor, and puree. Briefly boil together 3/4 c water and sugar to
  make thin sugar syrup, then set aside to cool. When cool, beat enough
  syrup into chestnut puree to make it thin enough to pipe through
  pastry bag but still thick enough to hold its shape. If using canned
  puree, sweeten to taste, making sure it is thin enough to be piped.
  Fit pastry bag with 1/8-inch plain tube and fill with puree. Beat
  cream until stiff, then add sugar to taste and vanilla. Beat egg
  white in separate bowl until stiff peaks form, then fold into cream.
  Place cream mixture into pastry bag fitted with star tip. Arrange
  meringue(s) on serving platter and pipe chestnut puree in bird's nest
  shape around edge of meringue. Pipe cream mixture in center, piling
  it high. Sprinkle grated chocolate over whipped cream and chill until
  serving time.

           -bottles)
  1 1/2 c  Flour (2 1/4 c.)
      2 c  Milk (3 c.)
      2 c  Heavy whipping cream (3 c.)
      2 c  Half-and-half (3 c.)
    1/2 ts Black pepper (1 tsp., DON'T
           -SALT!)
    1/2 lb Chopped clams (fresh, frozen
           -or canned) (3 lb. can)
    1/2 ts Clam base (optional,
           -available in most gourmet
           -shops)
 
  (I made 1 1/2 times this amount - see parenthesis for amt.)
  
  Place vegetables, bacon and margarine in a 5 quart sauce pot. Saute
  over medium heat until vegetables are tender. Be careful not to brown
  or scorch.
  
  When vegetables are tender, add flour to make a roux. Cook for two
  minutes, allowing flour to cook while stirring occasionally.
  
  Add clam juice and dairy products.  Stir by using a wire whip.
  
  Add fresh garlic, black pepper, chopped clams and clam base. Cook over
  low-medium heat stirring occasionally to prevent chowder from
  scorching. Cook for two hours or until chowder is brought to desired
  thickness.
  
  If a crockpot, or small steam kettle is available, it is recommended.
  Also, clam juice can be added to thin chowder down if it gets too
  thick.
  
  Note:  This soup is the BEST clam chowder I have ever tasted! It is
  thick and very rich and fattening! I didn't use the clam base since I
  don't even know what that is. Also, I didn't need to simmer it as
  long as suggested. I cooked it for about 1 1/2 hours. The chowder
  needs to be stirred OFTEN, probably about every 5-10 minutes or so or
  it will stick to the bottom of the pot.  Also, I one-and-one-halved
  times'd it, using about 3 lbs. of chopped clams instead of the
  recommended amount. I also served it with the little soup "clam"
  crackers. It made about 5 quarts this way. Deb C.

      Title: MONTMORENCY CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Fruit
      Yield: 1 Cake
 
     14 oz Semisweet chocolate; broken
           -into bits (or use chips)
      2 tb Instant coffee granules; opt
    1/2 c  Kirsch
      4    Eggs; separated
     12 tb Unsalted butter; room temp
    1/3 c  All-purpose flour
      1 pn Salt
    2/3 c  Granulated sugar
      1 lb Fresh cherries or one 1-lb
           -can pitted sour cherries
           -packed in water, drained
           Fresh cherries for garnish
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Line the bottom of a 9-inch cake pan
  with a piece of buttered waxed paper or baking parchment, then spread
  the sides evenly with butter.
  
  In a heavy-bottomed saucepan set over low heat, melt 8 ounces of the
  chocolate with 1 tablespoon of the coffee granules and 1/4 cup kirsch,
  stirring until smooth. Off heat stir in the egg yolks, one at a time,
  then return the pan to the heat and stir the mixture briefly until
  the yolks are warmed and have thickened the chocolate slightly. Off
  heat again, beat in the butter by tablespoons, stirring until smooth.
  Stir in the flour.
  
  Beat the egg whites with the pinch of salt until they form soft peaks.
  Sprinkle on 1/3 cup of the sugar and continue beating until the
  whites form fairly stiff and shiny peaks. Fold the warm chocolate
  mixture delicately into the meringue and turn the batter into the
  prepared pan. Bake at 375'F for 20-25 minutes, until the cake has
  puffed and a knife inserted in the center comes out with only a
  slightly creamy layer. Do not overcook. Set the pan on a rack to cool
  for at least 45 minutes before unmolding. As it cools, the cake will
  sink and the surface will crack slightly.
  
  You can prepare the cherries while the cake is baking and cooling.
  Pit the fruit and set in a saucepan with the remaining 1/3 cup sugar
  and 2 tablespoons kirsch. Cook over medium-low heat, partially
  covered, for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Uncover the pan
  for the last 10 minutes or so; the cherries should reduce to a thick
  compote. When done, allow to cool, then chop roughly and set aside.
  (If you are using canned cherries, prepare them as above, but cook
  them for only 20-25 minutes.)
  
  Invert the cake onto a serving platter and remove the paper. Using a
  large spoon, trace about a 5-inch circle in the center of the cake;
  then scoop out the top part of the circle, leaving at least 1/2 inch
  of cake at the bottom. Add the scooped-out cake to the cherries and
  stir together well. Return the chocolate-cherry mixture back into the
  cake, smoothing it nicely with a flexible metal spatula.
  
  In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, melt remaining chocolate with 1
  tablespoon coffee granules, 3 tablespoons water and 2 tablespoons
  kirsch, stirring occasionally until smooth. Allow to cool slightly,
  then spread evenly over the top and sides of the cake. Use a towel
  dipped in hot water to remove any smudges from the platter and set
  the cake in the refrigerator until 30 minutes before serving. The
  chocolate glaze will lose a bit of its shine when chilled, but the
  cake is really better served slightly below room temperature. Serve
  the cake garnished, if you wish, with more whole cherries.
  
  Variation: For the cherries in the recipe substitute a puree of fresh
  figs; or chopped dried pitted prunes or dried apricots, plumped in
  water and a little kirsch and flavored with orange marmalade.

           Pinch freshly ground white
           -pepper
    1/2 lb Chicken breasts, strips
           SAUCE:
    1/2 ts Sugar
      2 ts Oyster sauce
      1 ts Light soy sauce
    1/2 ts Sesame oil
      2 ts Cornstarch
      1 pn White pepper
      5 tb Chicken stock
  3 1/2 tb Peanut oil
      1 tb Ginger, minced
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 lb Mushrooms, sliced
      6 oz Snow peas, sliced
    1/4 c  Bamboo shoots, sliced
      4    Water chestnuts, sliced
      1    Clove garlic, minced
      1 tb White wine
 
  1.  MAKE THE MARINADE:  Place the grated ginger in a small strainer
  set over a medium bowl.  Press hard with the back of a spoon to
  extract 1 teaspoon of juice; discard the ginger pulp. Stir in the
  remaining marinade ingredients.  Add the chicken and toss to coat
  well. Cover and set aside to marinate for 30 minutes. 2. MAKE THE
  SAUCE: In a large bowl, combine all the sauce ingredients and
  reserve. 3. Heat a wok over high heat for 30 seconds.  Add 2
  tablespoons of the peanut oil and turn the wok to coat with oil. When
  a wisp of white smoke appears, add the ginger and salt. Stir, using a
  large metal spatula, for 10 seconds. Add the mushrooms and stir fry
  for 10 seconds. Add the snow peas, bamboo shoots and water chestnuts;
  sprinkle with a little water and stir fry for 2 minutes. Transfer the
  vegetables to a bowl and set aside. Wipe out the wok with paper
  towels. 4. Heat the wok over high heat for 20 seconds and add the
  remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons peanut oil.  Turn the wok to coat with
  oil. When a wisp of white smoke appears, add the garlic. When it
  begins to brown, add the chicken with the marinade.  Spread the
  chicken out in a single layer and cook undisturbed for 2 minutes.
  Turn the chicken pieces over and cook for 1 more minute. Drizzle the
  wine down the inside rim of the wok and stir it into the chicken.
  Continue to cook until the chicken is cooked through, about 1 minute
  longer. 5. Add the reserved vegetables and stir fry for 2 minutes.
  Make a well in the center of the mixture. Stir the sauce to combine
  and pour it into the well. Mix all the ingredients together, bring
  the sauce to a boil and cook until thickened, about 30 seconds.
  Transfer to a warm platter and serve immediately.

      Title: MOO GOO GAIPAN #2
 Categories: Chinese, Chicken
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Boneless, skinless chicken
           -breast
      1 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Fresh grated ginger
      1 tb Corn starch
      1    Head/bunch fresh bok choy
    1/2 lb To 3/4 lb fresh mushrooms
    1/2 lb Fresh snow peas, stringed &
           -halved
      2 c  Chicken stock/bouillon
      2 tb Corn starch
      2 tb To 3 tb peanut oil
 
  Remove any fat or tendons from the chicken and slice into pieces 1/4"
  by 1" or so (this works better if chicken is partially frozen). Mix
  chicken with next three ingredients and allow to marinate while you
  are preparing the vegetables.
  
  Wash bok choy thoroughly, trim off the tough ends of the leaves and
  part of the base, and chop into bite-size pieces including the green
  parts. Slice the mushrooms. Cut the snow peas in half or slice after
  the tips and strings have been removed.  Mix the stock and the corn
  starch in a shaker
  
  Heat oil in wok until its almost smoking and then stir fry the chicken
  until its almost cooked through.  Then add the vegetables and stir fry
  until the bok choy leaves get sort of wilted down. Pour in the
  stock/cornstarch mixture that was shaken just before pouring it in.
  Stir constantly until the sauce thickens. Serve immediately over
  cooked rice.
  
  Note:  You can add bamboo shoots, sliced water chestnuts and all
  sorts of other stuff to this but I like the plain version best. About
  the only thing I change is to throw in some Mrs. Dash, which isn't
  very Chinese, but heh! Enjoy.

  Wash dal & bring to a boil.  Add salt & turmeric, remove any scum that
  gathers on the surface.  Cover & simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, or until
  tender.  (Mark's note: the recipe doesn't say, but I presume that it
  is calling for split moong beans: whole ones take a whole lot longer
  to cook than this).
  
  Heat ghee in a large pot & add cumin seeds, bay leaves, chiles,
  onions & ginger.  Fry for 2 minutes, stirring. Add raisins & coconut
  & mix in the cooked dal. Add the remaining ingredients & simmer over
  low heat, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes.  If the resultant dal is
  too thick, thin it with a little water. It should be conssitency of
  pea soup.

      Title: MOP FOR ALL BARBEQUE MEATS
 Categories: Sauces, Rubs
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 tb Salt
  1 1/2 tb Dry mustard
      1 tb Garlic powder
    1/2 tb Ground bay leaf
      1 tb Chili powder
  1 1/2 tb Paprika
      1 tb Louisiana Hot Sauce
      1 pt Worcestershire sauce
    1/2 pt Vinegar
      2 qt Bone stock
    1/2 pt Oil
 
  Make the bone stock just the way you would start a soup - buy good
  stout beef bones from the butcher and boil them. Add all the other
  ingregients and let stand overnight before using. Use this to rub
  over meats or to baste them while they are cooking.  Put it on with a
  little dish mop of the kind you see in the dime store. As you use it,
  the flavor will change and improve, for you are constantly
  transfering smoke and grease from the meat back to the mop
  concoction.  If you have any left over, keep it in the refrigerator.

      1    Md-sz ripe tomato,
           -quartered
    1/2    Md-sz green bell
           -pepper, seeded
      1    Md-sz onion, quart.
           Salt and black pepper
      2 lb Fish fillets (cod,

           -white, firm-fleshed
           -fish)
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
    1/2 c  Thin coconut milk*
      2 tb Dende*
      2 tb Peanut oil
 
  *Heat a coconut in a 350 degree oven for 10 minutes so it will develop
  "fault lines. Remove from oven and, holding it in a cloth (it will be
  hot) over a large bowl, hit it along the fault lines with a hammer or
  heavy mallet. The coconut will open. Reserve the liquid, remove the
  meat from the shell and take off the brown outer pieces with a
  pairing knife. Grate the coconut meat, either with a hand grater or
  in a food processor. Wrap in cheesecloth and pour 1/2 cup warm water
  over it while holding it over a bowl. Squeeze the liquid from the
  coconut into the bowl. This is thick coconut milk. Add the reserved
  coconut water and grated coconut residue. This is the only way to get
  the true Brazilian taste. Otherwise, you can buy a bottle of coconut
  milk from specialty stores (and it is pretty hideous). African
  markets in the United States. Chop the coriander, tomato, pepper, and
  onion in a food processor until you have a coarse paste. Then place
  the mixture in a large, heavy skillet over low heat. Add the salt and
  pepper and cook for 15 minutes. Add the fish fillets to the mixture
  and continue cooking for an additional 5 to 7 minutes. Add the
  remaining ingredients, stir and allow to simmer for 5 minutes. Serve
  the moqueca hot with white rice and Farofa.

  rice formed into conical mound. Pour remaining syrup and 4 teaspoons
  Liquid Saffron over rice. Make 2-3 holes through rice to bottom of
  saucepan with handle of wooden spoon. Spread clean dishcloth over
  edges of saucepan and set cover firmly over dishcloth.
  
  Keep heat on high until rice is steaming, 2-3 minutes, then reduce
  heat to low and cook at least 30 minutes. Rice can be kept on very
  lowest heat as long as 1 1/2 hours total.
  
  Remove saucepan from heat and set on cold, wet surface 1-2 minutes.
  (This helps loosen bottom crust.)
  
  Meanwhile, melt butter. Remove 2-3 tablespoons rice and mix with
  remaining 2 tablespoons Liquid Saffron in small bowl and set aside.
  
  Gently toss and mix pilaf, leaving crust in pot, and sprinkle on
  warmed dish in symmetrical mound. Sprinkle with saffron rice. Garnish
  with reserved almonds (both toasted and blanched), pistachios,
  currants and barberries.
  
  Crush crystallized sugar into small "diamonds," mix with 1/2 teaspoon
  boiling water and sprinkle over rice. Pour melted butter all over.
  Remove bottom crust (tah dig) from pot and serve on separate plate.
  Makes 4-6 servings.

    1/4 c  Lemon juice
      2    Eggs
    1/4    To 1/2 tsp lemon peel
 
  SOURCE: Natl Cooking Echo 19 Jun 90
  
  Contributed to the echo by: Debra Heng
  
  I haven't made these lemon ones yet, but I scaled down a larger
  recipe from some cookbook to resemble the pecan tassie proportions,
  hoping to have enough lemon filling for a batch of tartlets. So it
  may or may not be enough, thought I'd let ya know.
  
  LEMON TASSIE FILLING
  
  In a small saucepan over low heat, cook the 1 st three until
  dissolved. Beat the eggs with a mixer and add the hot mix very
  slowly, mixing constantly. Then return mix to the saucepan and cook
  for about 3 minutes until it's of pudding consistency. Stir in lemon
  peel. Let cool to room temp. Fill each tartlet with about 2 tsps of
  the lemon mix. Bake at 350 F for 20-25 mins., or until golden.
  
  The back of the tart tamper package also suggested some other
  fillings, like cherry or blueberry pie filling, or vanilla pudding
  topped afterwards with a strawberry or a few blueberries (glaze with
  some heated currant jelly).

 Categories: Digest, August
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           None
 
  The archive is very picky with respect to syntax.
  
  To get a recipe you must know two things:
  
  1) the category 2) the name of the recipe. You can re-read Ari's
  instructions on how to get these. For example, one of the categories
  is "bread" and in the bread category, one the recipes is named
  "tomato-bread". To get a copy of that recipe, you must send the
  following exact command to the archive server:
  
  get recipes/breads/tomato-bread
  
  This must be exact, with no extraneous spaces and including the slash
  marks.  The message must also have the word "archive" in the subject
  heading.
  
  You can get a listing of the *CATEGORIES* by sending the command:
  
  ls recipes
  
  Note that this will only return a listing of the categories, not the
  recipe names.
  
  To get a listing of recipes in a specific category, say "breads" send
  the command:
  
  ls recipes/breads
  
  This will list the recipes.  Then to get a recipe you must include
  both the category name and the recipe name in the following *exact*
  format:
  
  get recipes/category-name/recipe-name
  
  You must fully specify the file in this format, including the slash
  marks and without extra spaces. You cannot have lines that have other
  file information such as dxwrx-rx-r or Aug 20 or any such thing.
  
  If you've double-checked your syntax and are sure it is correct, feel
  free to send me a copy of your request (good idea is to send it to
  the archive AND cc: artemis@rahul.net) and I can look to see what is
  wrong.
  
  Good luck, I know this can be confusing for folks not familiar with
  Unix file formating.

  The next two (also from Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book) use the previous
  recipe as a basis, with just a few changes.
  
  GARBANZO RICE BREAD
  
  This bread has a mellower flavor and keeps better than the plain
  Brown Rice Bread.
  
  Follow the mixing and rising instructions for Brown Rice Bread. Use
  only two loaf pans and bake slightly longer, about 50 minutes to an
  hour.
  
  SOY-RAISIN RICE BREAD
  
  Denser, cakier, more filling, this bread adds variety and interest.
  The slice is golden in color and soft, almost like pound cake.
  
  6 cups brown rice flour (600 g) 2 tablespoons soy flour (7 g) 1
  tablespoon salt (16.5 g) 2 2/3 cups tepid water (635 ml) 4 teaspoons
  active dry yeast (1/2 oz or 14 g) 1/2 cup warm water (120 ml) 1/3 cup
  honey (80 ml) 1/4 cup oil (60 ml) 1/2 cup raisins (70 g) 1/4 cup
  methocel (28 g)
  
  Mix and let rise like Brown Rice Bread, incorporating the soy flour
  into the first mixing and the raisins along with the honey. Divide
  the dough into two loaves only, and bake cooler and longer, at 325
  deg.F. for 50 to 60 minutes, or until done.

 Categories: Danish, Sandwiches, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  SHRIMP SANDWICH: (Rejemad)
  
  The small Danish shrimps are extremely popular delicacies and most
  Danish housewives are virtual masters at peeling them, but it is slow
  work for the beginner.  At restaurants shrimps are always served
  peeled unless the customer specifically asks for unpeeled ones.
  
  Put a fresh leaf of lettuce on the buttered bread and top abundantly
  with cold boiled shrimps.
  
  SMOKED SALMON AND SCRAMBLED EGG:  (Roget Laks og Roraeg)
  
  Put a piece of fresh smoked salmon on buttered bread, and on top of
  that, diagonally across the bread, a strip of cold scrambled egg.
  Decorate with finely chopped green dill.
  
  LOBSTER SALAD:  (Hummersalat)
  
  Mix small pieces of cold but freshly cooked lobster and asparagus in
  mayonnaise seasoned with tarragon vinegar. Put a lettuce leaf on each
  piece of buttered bread and spread with the mixture. Garnish with an
  extra piece of lobster and one or two asparagus tips. Serve
  immediately.
  
  SMOKED EEL AND SCRAMBLED EGG:  (Roget aal og Roraeg)
  
  Cut smoked eel in 2-inch pieces.  Remove skin and back bone. Put
  enough pieces of eel on a piece of buttered bread to cover it
  completely. Top with slices of cold scrambled egg and sprinkle with
  chives.
  
  FRIED ROE:  (Ristet Torskerogn)
  
  Put boiled cod roe under pressure until cold and cut in 1/2 inch
  slices with a sharp knife.  Fry the slices in plenty of butter, place
  on buttered bread with a lemon slice on top. Cut the lemon slice half
  way and twist so it will stand upright.
  
  FRIED FISH FILLETS:  (Stegt Fiskefilet)
  
  As the fried fish fillet (of plaice or sole) should be served warm,
  do not place it on the bread as this would melt the butter. Serve
  buttered bread on a separate plate. Serve with Tartar sauce.
  
  HERRING SALAD:  (Sildesalat)
  
  Cooked meat Cold potatoes Red beets 1 sliced onion Salted and smoked
  or pickled herring Sour mustard Flour Butter
  
  Place the the meat, potatoes, red beets, onion and well soaked
  herring on a chopping board together with the mustard and dice until
  the whole thing has become a mushy mass. If it is too dry and won't
  stick together add a little vinegar from the red beets, and flavor
  with sugar.
  
  This procedure makes the "fine herring salad" usually made by the
  Danish housewife for everyday use.  But you can make the salad coarse
  too by cutting (instead of dicing) the different ingredients in a
  long narrow strips and blending them with a thick sauce, made of 2
  tablespoons butter and 4 cups flour cooked together and diluted with
  water or stock. Flavor the sauce with vinegar from the red beets,
  sugar and mustard to taste, and, if necessary, add a few drops of
  coloring until you get a beautiful red shade.
  
  Spread the bread with the herring salad and decorate with slices of
  hard boiled egg, if you don't prefer topping it with a fried egg.

      Title: MORE SOURDOUGH STARTER
 Categories: Breads, Meats
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 c  Water,
      1 c  Sugar, and
    1/2 c  Potato flakes.
 
  Now the starters.  This is the starter that Connie used. After that
  is an alternative for people who have trouble with the first one.
  
  Potato starter I:
  
  Mix the ingredients.  Cover loosely and leave in a warm place, such
  as on top of a water heater, for 3 or 4 days. If the mixture starts
  to smell yeasty prior to 3 or 4 days, or is ready. Go ahead and feed
  it and start making bread.  See the feeding directions below. This is
  from the "Panola COunty Heritage Cookbook".
  
  For people who have trouble cultivating wild yeast, this is an
  alternate starter recipe.
  
  Potato starter II: 2 evelopes (2 TBSP) active dry yeast, 1/2 cup warm
  water (105 to 115 F), 1 cup warm water (105 to 115 F), 2/3 cup sugar,
  and 3 TBSP instant potato flakes.
  
  Dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup warm water in a medium mixing bowl.
  Stir in 1 cup warm water, sugar, and potato flakes.
  
  Let the mixture sit out all day, then refrigerate 10 to 15 days. (A
  10 day schedule works fine.)  Remove from refrigerator and feed, see
  the feeding instructions below.  Now you are ready to use 1 cup of

      Title: MORE THAN YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT HASH
 Categories: Breakfast, Side dish, Info/tips
      Yield: 99 Servings
 
           Potatoes
           Butter/margarine,oil
 
  Hmmm... After years of experimenting (read: Whoops!), I think I can
  safely give you an idea on how to come up with *good* Hash Browns.
  
  I'm going to start with raw potatoes. They make the best HBs. Diners
  and real "cook-it-on-site" restaurants do it this way. Peel and prep
  the spuds however you like for the final product. ie. Hash Browns
  will be diced, Home Fries can be sliced as thin as potato chips.
  Grated ones I have seen with many names, but the most common was
  Latkes <G>. (The names are not really important, pick the *type* you
  like. The name can vary from cook to cook.)
  
  Next for the real diner type spud, parboil them THE NIGHT BEFORE! They
  should be dropped into rapidly boiling water, then returned to a
  boil. By the time the water has gotten back to a "rolling" boil, they
  should be done. Stir 'em a couple times and test one or two. The
  "crunch" of fresh spuds should be all gone, but they can't be mushy.
  Then, drain them completely and run COLD water over them until they
  are no longer warm. If you fail to do this, the internal heat of the
  spuds will continue to cook them. You want to do that yourself, in
  the skillet.
  
  NOTE: If using grated or very thinly sliced potatoes, drain and rinse
  before the water returns to a full boil. These cook *very* quickly.
  
  Now, after you've cooled everything down under the faucet, drain, and
  store in a sealed container in the fridge. Refrigerate overnight.
  
  Next morning, pull out the amount of spuds you'll need, about 1 medium
  potato per person. (Or 1 large handful) Then, pre-heat a skillet or
  griddle until a drop of water "dances". Add your
  butter/margarine/oil. The amount is up to you and the quantity you're
  cooking. You will need enough to lightly coat all the spuds. Keep
  your heat around a "medium" temp. Remember, grills in diners are at a
  constant temp all day long. You need even heat for best results.  Do
  not use a "Shedd-spread" type whipped butter substitute. They don't
  fry well.
  
  Type of pan? Use heavy cast-iron or aluminum. You are going to be
  dropping cold spuds into hot oil and thin pans will cool off rapidly,
  requiring extra cooking time to re-heat the pan.
  
  Drop the spuds into the oil and flip constantly until all of them are
  coated with b/m/o. Press down to ensure even heating and place a flat
  pot lid over the potatoes until they are ready to turn the first
  time. Brown to your desired preference. Turn once and when browned on
  the other side, use your spatula to break them loose from the pan and
  slide onto a serving plate. Enjoy.
  
  (If using frozen spuds, such as Ore-Ida, thaw them first. They are
  already partially cooked and will give you "crisp on the outside,
  mush on the inside" if used frozen rock-solid)
  
  Now, aren't you sorry you asked? <BG>

      Title: MORELS IN POULETTE SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces, Loo, Appetizers
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Sauce:
  3 1/2 c  Chicken broth
      3 tb Butter
      3 tb Flour
      3    Egg yolks
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
           Salt and pepper
           Mushrooms:
      1 lb Morels, trimmed, washed,
           -squeezed dry.
      3 tb Butter
           Finishing:
      3    More egg yolks
      1 c  Chicken broth
    1/4 c  Chopped mushrooms, any kind
      3 tb Butter
           Salt and pepper
           Fresh ground nutmeg
      2 tb Chopped parsley
      1 ts Lemon juice or to taste
 
  Reduce the broth by half. Strain. Mix the butter and flour over low
  heat, stirring for a couple of minutes but making sure the flour does
  not brown. Whisk in 1/4 c broth and then gradually add the rest. Cook
  10 min. Turn off heat. Beat yolks and cream together and stir into
  the sauce. Bring sauce slowly to the boil and immediately take it off
  the heat. Season with pepper; unless you used salt-free broth, you
  probably don't need salt.
  
  Melt butter over medium heat. Add mushrooms. Turn heat to high and
  cook 2 min. Reduce heat to minimum and cook covered 5 min. Remove
  mushrooms to a hot platter and reserve braising liquid.
  
  Put the rest of the egg yolks into a large heavy saucepan. Stir in
  broth and the sauce already made. Blend well and cook over low heat.
  Add chopped mushrooms, all at once, and stir in. Add cooked mushroom
  liquid. Stir in butter a teaspoon at a time. Cook until thick and
  strain. Season with pepper, nutmeg to taste, parsley and lemon juice.
  Taste for salt and add any if necessary.
  
  Pour finished sauce over mushrooms and serve with toast.

      1 c  Unconverted long-grain rice
      2 c  Cold water
           Touch of sea salt (optional)
           Plain Boiled Rice
 
  Put the rice into a bowl, cover with very hot water, and leave to soak
  about 8 minutes.  Drain, rinse well, and set aside. Put 2 cups water
  in a heavy pot or earthenware bean pot, bring to a boil, sprinkle in
  the rice, and return to the boil.  Cover the pan, turn the heat to
  the lowest possible point, and cook until all the water has been
  absorbed by the rice, shaking the pot from time to time so that it
  does not stick. Test the rice after about 15 minutes; if soft but not
  mushy, turn off the heat and leave the rice sitting, still covered,
  for a further 5 minutes. Very carefully loosen the rice with a fork,
  fluffing it up. Cover again and leave to sit for another 15 minutes.
  Add salt if desired.

      9 oz Raisins
      3 oz Pine nuts
    1/2 c  Honey

  minutes more. Remove from heat and add honey. Adjust seasonings to
  taste. Place chicken in baking dish, cover with mixture and bake at
  325F for 1 hour or until nicely browned and tender. This recipe came
  from a Moroccan restaurant in the old quarter of Jerusalem. The
  owners generously gave us this recipe at our request -- in a mixture
  of Hebrew and Arabic with metric measurements. Many people
  contributed to the translation, and the result is worth their
  efforts. So to be faithful, you should actually use 2.2 pounds of
  onions -- 1 kilo!

      Title: MOROCCAN-STYLE PRESERVED LEMONS
 Categories: Preserves
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
     12    Lemons
           Kosher salt -- as needed
 
  Procedures:   Select twelve unblemished organically grown small
  lemons, preferrably Meyer (a small type). Wash and dry the lemons. If
  using store-bought lemons, scrub them carefully to remove any
  pesticides. Cut a thin slice from the top and the bottom of each
  lemon. Set one lemon on end and make a vertical cut 3 quarters of the
  way through the fruit, so that the 2 halves still remain attached at
  the base; do not cut it in half. Turn the lemon upside down and
  rotate it so that you can make a second vertical cut down the center,
  crosswise to the first, leaving the bottom attached, as you did
  previously. Fill each cut with as much salt as it will hold.
  Carefully place the lemon at the bottom of a hot, sterilized,
  wide-mouthed quart glass jar. Proceed in this manner with the
  remaining lemons, compressing them in the jar untilno space is left
  and the lemon juice has risen to the top. Seal and set aside at room
  temperature. More lemons may be added in the following days as the
  lemon rinds begin to soften. Make sure the lemons are covered with
  juice at all times, adding freshly squeezed lemon juice if necessary.
  The lemons are ready to use when the rinds are tender, in 5 to 6
  weeks. Rinse them lightly before using. Once opened, refrigerate
  preserved lemons for up to 6 months. Makes 12 lemons. Recipe By     :

  water if needed (stew must be moist but not watery). Keep tightly
  covered at all times. If about 2 hours before serving time the stew
  seems too watery than uncover lid and increase fire so water can
  evaporate.

      1 c  Olives purchased from deli
           -or Middle Eastern grocery
           -(green
 
  Yield: 1 cup
  
  Olives are often served as part of the Middle Eastern appetizer
  assortment called mezze or mazza that is brought to your table with
  your wine, ouzo, or arak. Anything can turn up as part of a mezze
  selection: octopus dressed in olive oil and lemon, chunks of feta
  cheese or salami on small pieces of bread, or a plate of creamy, tart
  hummus. Olives, brined, salted, or marinated, are almost always on
  one of the little plates.
  
  Middle Eastern marketplaces feature huge vats and crocks of
  differently spiced olives in myriad array. Some are fleshy, some
  juicy, others bitter and dense, and each is in a subtly different
  mainade. The marinade in this recipe is good for almost any type of
  olive; it is especially delicious with green brined olives or fleshy
  Greek-style ones (it even improves California-style ripe Olives).
  
  brine-cured, Kalamata, Greek-style, or shriveled black dry-cured) 1/4
  cup olive oil 4 cloves garlic, chopped 1 tsp fresh rosemary leaves,
  lightly crushed 1 1/2 tsp Aji Harissa, Berbere, or commercial
  chile-garlic paste
        1    tbsp wine vinegar
  
  1.  Drain olives of any brine.
  
  2.  Slowly heat olive oil over low heat. Remove from heat and add
  garlic, rosemary, chile-garlic paste, and vinegar.
  
  3.  Pour marinade over olives and let stand at least 2 hours (the
  flavor gets hotter the longer it stands).
  
  ADVANCE PREPRATION:  Lasts almost forever, covered and refrigerated
  
  VARIATION:  A Mediterranean-inspired hors d'oeuvre.
  
  4 ounces Montrachet or Leazay goat cheese 1 to 2 cloves garlic,
  chopped 1 tsp finely chopped cilantro (optional) 1 tsp medium salsa
  (or to taste) 1/2 tsp thyme 1 tsp olive oil Approximately 1/2 a
  French baguette, cut into 1/2 to 3/4 inch slices Morroccan Spiced
  Olives
  
  1.  Mash goat cheese with a fork.  Add garlic, cilantro, salsa,
  thyme, and olive oil.
  
  2.  Spread goat cheese mixture on bread slices; top each with half a
  pitted marinated olive.
  
  RECOMMENDED WINE:  Enjoy with a glass of a medium-bodied Cabernet
  Sauvignon with noticeable character, one from California, Chile, or
  Spain.

      4 oz Cream cheese
      4    Eggs; large
    1/2 c  Half and half; or milk*
    1/3 c  Marmelade; or jam of choice
 
  *Sometimes more... Howard made this just last month in honer of his
  Dad at JAKE'S in Londonderry, VT.  It is truly 'baaad'and Mort
  promised he would eat it only at the restaruant.
  
  TAke all the ingredients except the bread and put through the blender
  or FP. Spray with Pam (at this point, who cares) or butter a 8"
  square pan. Pour a bit of the batter in the bottom of the pan and put
  4 slices down and pour about half the batter over the bread. Then 4
  more slices and the rest of the batter.
  
  Sprinkle with cinnamon and bake at 350 degrees for about 3/4 hour.
  Pour the batter at least 1 hour before baking and as much as
  overnight. Please refigerate. Howard stuffed the bread with extra
  chuncks of cream cheese....but why not fruit like apples or banana
  slices???? You could add some brown sugar to the batter and a dash of
  vanilla. We didn't, but served with VERMONT MAPLE SYRUP. Converted by

      Title: MORT'S QUICHE
 Categories: Cajun, Cheese, Eggs, Mushrooms
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  :          MORT'S QUICHE -- See below:
  
  The quiche is composed of three elements: pastry, custard and
  filling. The filling takes the most time and while its bubbling away
  you can prepare the other stuff. The following is for a 10-11" quiche
  ring pan. Be sure to use a ring pan, the pastry tends to burn if
  cooked in a pie pan (it'll taste fine, but looks like hell). THE
  FILLING: The filling is composed of three components. Two are cooked
  (mushrooms and onions), one ( sharp cheddar cheese) is not. The green
  onions and the mushrooms are cooked in separate pans and then
  combined later. Clarify a quarter pound of butter. Put about 3/4ths
  of it into a large frying pan for the mushrooms and the rest in a
  smaller frying pan for the onions. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the
  butter and add about a tablespoon for the mushrooms, and about a
  teaspoon for the onions, of the following (I just pour the stuff from
  the bottle into the pan): Worchester sauce Soy sauce Teriyaki sauce
  Then shake a liberal amount ( I'd guess this to be about 1/2 and 1/4
  teaspoon, respectively) of CINNAMON (now don't falter here) into each
  pan. Turn the heat to high and put the mushrooms and onions in their
  respective pans. You'll need a lot of both because you REALLY cook
  this stuff down. THE MUSHROOMS: You'll need one big plastic bag of
  mushrooms (about soccer ball sized) finely sliced. They'll form a
  mountain in the pan and some will probably slide off onto the stove.
  Just keep throwing the 'shrooms in the pan and stir with a wooden
  fork when possible. Cook until they are very brown and caramelized.
  You really want to get the moisture out of them. You'll be surprised
  how much they reconstitute after baking. THE ONIONS: You'll like the
  onions because you get to share a beer with them. You'll need about
  six bunches of medium-sized green onions. Chop into 1/8 " slices all
  the way back to the chive portion. Cut and reserve a cup of the
  chives for later garnishing. Brown the onions until they are almost
  burnt on high heat. Then pour a half of a beer in the pan (pour other
  half down yourself) and cover for about 5 minutes. Uncover and reduce
  onions until caramelized. Combine with mushrooms and mix thoroughly
  for a few minutes. Let this stuff cool while you prepare the pastry
  and custard. THE PASTRY: This pastry is pretty fragile. Don't freak
  out if it tears. You can patch it with egg whites and dough, so don't
  sweat it. 1 cup flour
      1/4 lb butter 2 tablespoons brown sugar 4 egg yokes (reserve egg
  whites) A little milk as kneaded(excuse me) Put flour in medium sized
  bowl. Make a dent in the middle and put in eggs yolks. Slice up
  butter and drop it in. Throw in the brown sugar and dive in. Use one
  hand, octopus style. Hold off on the milk until the dough is pretty
  well kneaded. Sometimes I don't use any. When you've got a good ball
  formed, toss it back and forth and compress between your hands. This
  warms up the dough and makes it a little easier to roll. Coat well
  with flour. Make large pile of flour on wax paper or a pastry cloth.
  Knead the dough into a saucer-shaped patty and roll out slowly, using
  lots of flour, working from the center. This dough will crack, so
  roll it a couple inches larger then necessary. Check your size
  against the bottom disk of your pastry ring. Trim dough to 1" to 1
  1/2" around the disk (I use a pastry wheel, the jagged kind). Slip
  the disk under the rolled dough. I place a bowl inside the ring, set
  the disk with the dough on it on the bowl, and then gently lift the
  ring at an angle while lifting the edge of the dough around the ring.
  Repair tears with egg white and extra dough. Brush pastry with egg
  white. Pierce all over with fork. Then trim pastry with sharp knife
  always cutting away from center of the pan. (You do not need to
  grease the pastry ring. The butter in the dough keeps it from
  sticking.) THE CUSTARD: You can use either sour cream or whipping
  cream or both in the custard. You're on the home stretch now. 16 oz
  sour cream or whipping cream (or 8 oz of each) 4 egg yolks
      1/2    pound of grated jack cheese Pinch of nutmeg Combine in a
  mixing bowl and stir it all up with a whisk. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER:
  Really, this is worth all the trouble, so let's press on. Cut some
  approximately 1/8" square rods of EXTRA SHARP cheddar cheese and
  place them like spokes in the bottom of the pastry shell. Spoon in
  the mushroom/onion mixture. Spoon custard over the whole shebang. Lay
  down some more rods of cheddar cheese on the custard. Sprinkle on
  green onion chives. Some VERY thin slices of red or white onion can
  be a nice touch, too. Preheat oven to 400x. Cook for 40-50 minutes,
  rotating it occasionally. It'll puff up pretty high while its
  cooking. Watch the center. It needs to puff up too and brown. I've
  been cooking this for over fifteen years and still chicken out
  sometimes and take it out before its completely done (it's still good
  but a bit runny in the middle). Let cook until it's dark brown. You
  won't believe how good this is.

      Title: MOSCOW IDAHO BAKERS
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 lg Russet potatoes,scrubbed
      1 tb Butter or margarine
    1/2 c  Chopped onion
    1/2 c  Milk
      5 ts Cornstarch
    1/4 c  Buttermilk
    1/2 c  Marsala or madiera
      1 c  Shredded Jack cheese
      8 oz Cooked ham, cut into
           -Julienne strips
      1 tb Dijon mustard
      1 tb Prepared horseradish
           Chopped parsley
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  The potato has had a roller-coaster history. From South America, its
  culture spread rapidly in the years following the discovery of the New
  World. Spain and Italy grew the potato first on the Continent, and it
  was firmly established in England by 1629, when John Parkinson, in
  his A GARDEN OF PLEASANT FLOWERS, pronounced the Virginia potato, as
  he called it, almost as good as the Spanish potato (we call the
  latter sweet potato). He recommended cooking this sweet vegetable
  with wine, sugar, and spices.
  
  For sheer comfort, few dishes can equal a steaming baked potato,
  freshly split, anointed with butter, and sprinkled with salt and
  pepper. The addition of a meat or cheese topping makes the baked
  potato a substantial entree. From Moscow, Idaho, home of the baking
  potato, A.J. Marineau sends us a recipe for such a dish.
  
  =======================================================
  ============== ====
  
  Pierce potatoes in several places with a fork. Set potatoes on oven
  rack and bake at 400'F. until potatoes give readily when squeezed,
  about 1 hour.
  
  Meanwhile, melt butter in a 1-1/2 to 2 quart pan over medium-high
  heat. Add onion and stir often until limp, about 5 minutes. Mix milk
  with cornstarch and stir into pan alongside with buttermilk and
  marsala.
  
  Stir over medium-high heat until boiling. Add cheese and stir until
  melted. Stir in ham, mustard, and horseradish; if sauce is ready
  before potatoes, set aside. To use, stir over medium-high heat until
  hot.
  
  Split potatoes in half lengthwise; fluff centers with a fork. Set 2
  halves on each plate and spoon sauce onto potatoes. Sprinkle with
  chopped parsley; season to taste with salt and pepper.

 Categories: Chinese, Beef, Lamb/mutton
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 pk Gyoza skins, 3" (cut to fit)

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
    1/4 lb Napa cabbage
    1/2 ts Salt, kosher
    1/2 lb Ground chuck ;and
    1/2 lb Ground top round; OR
      1 lb Lamb, ground
      1 tb Ginger, fresh; minced*
      3 tb Scallion; minced
      2 tb Soy sauce, thin
      3 tb Shao xing
      1 tb Sesame oil**
    1/2 ts Salt, kosher
    1/8 ts Pepper, black
    3/4 ts Orange peel, fresh; grated
    1/2 c  Oil; for frying
      2 c  Chicken stock; plus
      2 tb Oil; for steam cooking

MMMMM-----------------------DIPPING SAUCE----------------------------
      1 tb Soy sauce, thin
      2 tb Vinegar, black or balsamic
    1/4 ts Ginger, fresh; minced
    1/4 ts Sesame oil*
 
  Filling: Chop the cabbage finely, sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon kosher
  salt, and toss well to combine. Let stand a little, then drain the
  liquid and wring it out in cheesecloth to get rid of excess water.
  
  Scatter the cabbage in a large bowl, add the beef or lamb, and
  sprinkle the rest of the filling ingredients (through the orange
  peel) on top. Stir briskly in one direction only until all is well
  blended, with chopsticks or a fork, then throw the mixture lightly
  against the inside of the bowl a few times to compact the mass. For
  the best flavor, cover airtight with plastic wrap pressed directly on
  the surface and let stand half an hour at room temperature.
  
  Filling the dumplings: Line a baking sheet with no-stick parchment
  paper to hold the finished dumplings (they don't call 'em
  pot-stickers for nothing). Fill one wrapper at a time, keeping the
  remainder covered. Put two level teaspoons of filling off-center in
  the wrapper (as though you were making enchiladas, and nudge (or
  nudzh) it with your fingers into a half-moon shape about 2" long.
  This makes the dumplings easier to seal. Fold the wrapper exactly in
  half over the filling, pinching shut at the midpoint. Beginning to
  the right of the midpoint, make three tiny pleats on the *near* side
  of the wrapper only, folding the pleats *toward* the midpoint. After
  each pleat, pinch the dough to join the far, unpleated side of the
  wrapper. Pinch the extreme right corner of the arc closed. Now half
  the dumpling is sealed.
  
  Repeat the process to the left of the midpoint, aiming the pleats
  toward the midpoint again. Pinch the left corner closed, then gently
  pinch all along the arc to insure it is sealed and to thin the ridge
  of dough. Pan-frying the dumplings: About 20 minutes before serving,
  mix the ingredients for the dipping sauce, taste and adjust to your
  liking, and place it in small individual dip dishes or saucers
  alongside each place setting. Have two serving platters in a low oven
  to warm.
  
  Heat the skillet over high heat until hot enough to evaporate a bead
  of water on contact. Add enough oil to coat the bottom with a scant
  1/2" of oil, swirl the skillet to glaze it an inch up the sides, then
  adjust to give an even layer of oil. Reduce the heat to medium. When
  the oil is hot enough to foam a pinch of dry flour, pick up the
  dumplings by their tops and quickly arrange them smooth side down in
  the pan, making concen- tric rings. Crowd the dumplings a bit; this
  makes for prettier presen- tation when you're through. Adjust the
  heat so they sizzle mildly.
  
  Once the dumplings are in place, raise the heat slightly to bring
  them to a good sizzle and brown the bottoms. Check underneath
  frequently, and when the bottoms are evenly browned, give the stock
  mixture a stir and add enough to come halfway up the side of the
  dumplings. Expect a great hiss and cloud of steam when you add the
  stock.
  
  Adjust the heat to maintain a simmer, and cover the pot. After about
  seven minutes, lift the lid to peek inside the pot, and when the
  stock is almost all absorbed by the dumplings, remove the lid. Lift
  one dumpling with a spatula to check the bottom.  If it is not crisp
  enough to "clink" against a fingernail, then continue to cook for a
  minute or so more. If there is not enough oil left after steaming to
  crisp them, add a bit more oil from the side of the pan and swirl to
  distribute it under the dumplings.
  
  When the bottoms are crisp, turn off the heat, move the pan off the
  burner and loosen the bottoms of the dumplings with the spatula.
  Invert them onto the serving platter, bottoms up. Serve with the
  individual dishes of dipping sauce.

      Title: MOTHER MURPHY'S DIETETIC PIZZA
 Categories: Breads, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 pk "Jiffy" pizza crust mix
      1 cn Can Hunt's Classic Italian
           -Spaghetti Sauce with
           -Garlic & Herb 27 oz
           Gallo dry salami
      1 cn Sliced mushrooms
           -stems and pieces
           -small can
      1 cn Black olives
      2 lb Mozzerella
      1 lb Cheddar
 
  It takes about 1/3 to 1/2 the can of sauce, and maybe half the
  mozzerella. Make the pizza crust as directed on the box.  While it is
  standing for the 5 minutes, grate the mozzerella, about 1/4 the
  cheddar, and grease the pan. (I use a cookie sheet, which the $.45
  crust just covers.) Spread the crust, pour on the sauce, spread the
  sauce with a handy fork. Dump the cheese on and spread it around. The
  cheddar adds just a bit of flavor, while the mozzerella takes care of
  the texture. Frankly, I like provolone better, but it's just not
  traditional. Place the salami close together and overlapping.
  Sprinkle mushrooms over the top, and break olives in two. Use the
  whole can - to heck with the diet!

      Title: MOTHER'S SQUASH PIE
 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 c  Milk
  1 1/2 c  Mashed cooked butternut
           -squash
    3/4 c  Sugar
      1 tb Flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Ground ginger
    1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
      2 lg Eggs
      1    9" pie shell
 
  Because of its Thanksgiving associations, pumpkin has become the
  pre-eminent squash for pie-making. Many 19th century connoisseurs,
  however, insisted that other winter squashes had a more refined
  flavor. This recipe (Mabel Gray's from "Yankee Magazine's Great New
  England Recipes," 1983) would also work with acorn and other squashes.
  
  Heat milk and squash together in double boiler. In bowl, mix sugar,
  flour, salt, ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon. Then add eggs. Beat well
  with rotary beater. Add mixture to milk and squash in double boiler.
  Stir together well. Do not boil.
  
  Pour warm filling into pie shell. Bake at 400'F. 10 minutes, then
  reduce heat to 350'F. and bake until pie sets, about 15-20 minutes.
  Makes 6-8 servings.

  tomato sauce the following way." Place the onion and half of the oil
  in a saucepan and cook until the onion is lightly browned.
   Add tomatoes, carrot, parsley, garlic, salt, basil and celery. Cook,
  covered, over moderate heat, stirring very occasionally, for 1/2 hour
  or until the vegetables are very soft.
   Strain through a food mill, taste for salt and adjust if necessary.
  (If sauce is too thin, place on heat again to thicken. ) Remove from
  heat, add the remaining oil and stir.
   NOTE: For a marinara or a more piquant sauce, just before adding the
  last oil, add 1/4 tsp crushed hot red pepper and 1 clove garlic
  passed through a garlic press or chopped very fine. YIELDS: 3 cups,

  1 1/2 lb Ground chuck or lamb
      1    Clove garlic, minced
      1 ts Oregano

    1/8 ts Salt & pepper

MMMMM------------------------CREAM SAUCE-----------------------------
      2 tb Butter or margerine
      2 tb Flour
 
  MEAT SAUCE Melt butter, saute onion, meat & garlic, stirring until
  brown. Add herbs & spices and tomato sauce; bring to a boil. Reduce
  heat, simmer, uncovered, about 30 min. Just before assembling
  casserole, mix bread crumbs into sauce. EGGPLANT - Halve eggplants
  lengthwise. Cut each half across into 1/2" slices. Place slices in
  bottom of broiler pan. Sprinkle with salt & pepper and brush with
  butter. Broil 4 inches from heat four minute on each side. CREAM
  SAUCE -Melt butter & stir in flour, salt & pepper. Add millk
  gradually. Bring to a boil, stirring until thick. Remove from heat.
  Beat a small amount of cream mixture into eggs. Blend egg mixture
  into remaining sauce.  Mix well and set aside. TO ASSEMBLE ~ In a 2
  qt. shallow baking dish, layer half of the eggplant, overlapping
  slightly. Sprinkle w/2 tb of the combined cheeses. Pour meat sauce of
  eggplant. Sprinkle w/2 more tb of cheese.  Layer remaining eggplant
  over top. Pour cream sauce over all. Sprinkle w/remaining cheeses.
  Bake @350 until brown and top is set, approx. 35-40 min. This sounds
  more complicated than it is, and makes a great party dish, as it is
  very "forgiving" - eggplant haters won't even know what they're
  eating!

           -(recipe)
 
  1. Remove green caps from eggplants and slice eggplants in half
  lengthwise. Make deep slashes in eggplant pulp, but do not cut
  through skins. Sprinkle eggplant halves with the 1 tablespoon salt
  and allow to stand at room temperature 1/2 hour. 2. Squeeze moisture
  out of eggplant halves and brush cut sur- faces with the 2
  tablespoons of olive oil. Heat 4 eggplant halves at a time in
  Microwave Oven 7 minutes or until pulp is tender. Repeat with
  remaining eggplant halves. 3. Scoop pulp out of eggplant, being
  careful not to rip skins. Set skins aside. Chop eggplant pulp
  coarsely. Place pulp in a medium-sized, heat-resistant, non-metallic
  bowl and heat, un- covered, in Microwave Oven 4 minutes or until
  tender. Stir occasionally. 4. In a large heat-resistant, non-metallic
  bowl, crumble the lamb. Heat, uncovered, in Microwave Oven 5 minutes
  stirring frequently to break up pieces until meat is no longer pink.
  5. Liberally oil a deep, 2-quart, heat-resistant, non-metallic
  cas-serole. Line casserole with the reserved eggplant skins. Arrange
  skins with the purple sides toward the outside and wide ends of
  eggplant skins at the top of the casserole. 6. Drain the lamb juices
  and discard. Add chopped eggplant, onion, mushrooms, the 1 teaspoon
  salt, thyme, rosemary and garlic to the cooked lamb. Stir to combine
  well. Heat, uncovered, in Microwave Oven 5 minutes or until onion is
  tender. 7. In a small heat-resistant, non-metallic bowl combine beef
  stock and cornstarch until smooth. Heat, uncovered, in Microwave Oven
  1 minute or until thickened and clear; stir occasionally. 8. Add
  thickened beef stock with remaining ingredients, except tomato sauce,
  to lamb mixture. Pour lamb-eggplant mixture into eggplant-skin-lined
  casserole. 9. Fold eggplant skins over filling. Heat, covered with a
  plate, 9 minutes or until a knife inserted in the center of the
  mixture comes out clean. 10. Invert onto platter for serving. Serve

      Title: MOUSSAKA (VEGETARIAN EGGPLANT & CHEESE)
 Categories: Vegetables, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb (about 4) eggplant,
           -stems removed
      2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Corn oil
      4    Cloves garlic, chopped fine
    1/2 c  Tomato sauce
      6 oz Tomato paste
  1 1/2 c  Water
      2    Eggs, beaten
    1/2 lb Mozzarella cheese, grated
 
    This Jewish-style moussaka does not have meat since the kosher laws
  prohibit mixing meat and milk together. The result is a complete
  vegetarian dish with considerable dimension.
  
    1.  Cut each eggplant lengthwise into 3 equal slices. Sprinkle with
  the salt and let stand for 20 minutes, Dry the slices on paper towels
  to absorb the liquid that accumulates. Set aside.
  
    2.  Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a pan and stir-fry the garlic
  over moderate heat until golden, about 2 minutes. Add the tomato
  sauce, tomato paste, and water and mix well. Simmer the sauce over
  low heat until it becomes thickened, about 15 minutes.
  
    3.  Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil in a skillet. Dip the
  eggplant slices into the beaten eggs and fry over moderate heat for 2
  minutes.  Fry all the eggplant slices this way.
  
    4.  Assemble the moussaka in this manner.  Put a layer of eggplant
  in a heatproof glass or metal baking dish. Cover with about 1/2 cup
  of the cooked tomato sauce. Sprinkle with about 2 tablespoons of the
  grated cheese.  Cover this another layer of eggplant, then sauce,
  then cheese. The last layer (there should be three) ends with the
  cheese. Bake in a preheated
      350    degrees F oven for 1/2 hour.
  
    Serve warm.  Serves 6 with spaghetti or other dishes.

      Title: MOUSSE AU CHOCOLATE
 Categories: Chocolate, Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4    Egg yolks
    1/4 c  Superfine sugar
      2 tb Cognac
      6 oz Semisweet chocolate, cut in
           -small chunks
      3 tb Strong coffee
      8 tb Butter; soft, unsalted or
           -Sweet (1 stick) cut into
           -1/2" pieces
      4    Egg whites
    1/2 c  Heavy cream; whipped
 
  Brush the inside of a 1-quart charlotte (cylindrical) or ring mold
  with a film of vegetable oil. Invert the mold on paper towels to
  drain.
    In a heatproof mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar with a
  whisk, rotary or electric beater for 2 or 3 minutes or until they are
  pale yellow and thick enough to form a ribbon when the whisk is
  lifted from the bowl. Beat in the Cognac.
    Set the mixing bowl over a pan of barely simmering (not boiling)
  water, and continue beating for 3 or 4 minutes or until the mixture
  is foamy and hot. Then set the bowl over a pan of iced water and beat
  for 3 or 4 minutes longer, or until the mixture is cool again and as
  thick and creamy as mayonnaise.
    In a heavy 4 to 6-quart saucepan, melt the chocolate with the
  coffee over hot water, stirring constantly. When all the chocolate
  has dissolved, beat in the butter, one piece at a time, to make a
  smooth cream. Then beat the chocolate mixture into the egg yolks and
  sugar.
    In a separate bowl, with a clean whisk or beater, beat the egg
  whites until they are stiff enough to form stiff peaks on the wires
  of the whisk. Stir about 1/4 of the egg whites into the chocolate
  mixture to lighten it, then very gently fold in the remaining egg
  whites. Spoon the mousse into the oiled mold or dessert cups and
  refrigerate for at least 4 hours or until it has set.
    To unmold and serve, run a long, sharp knife around the sides of
  the mold and dip the bottom of it in hot water for a few seconds.
  Then wipe the outside of the mold dry, place a chilled serving plate
  upside down over the mold, and grasping both sides firmly, quickly
  turn the plate and mold over. Rap the plate on a table and the mousse
  should slide easily out of the mold. If the mousse doesn't unmold at
  once, repeat the whole process.
    With a wire whisk, rotary or electric beater, whip the chilled
  cream in a large bowl until it is firm enough to hold it's shape
  softly. Garnish with mousse with the whipped cream and serve.

           Softened
    1/4 c  Orange peel  -- glazed --
           Optional
      4    Egg whites
      1 pn Salt
      1 tb Sugar
      2 c  Creme anglaise -- vanilla
           Flavored OR
           Whipped cream -- sweetened
 
  Beat the egg yolks and sugar together until the mixture is thick, pale
  yellow and falls back upon itself forming a slowly dissolving ribbon.
  Beat in the orange liqueur. Set mixing bowl over not-quite-simmering
  water and continue beating for 3-4 minutes until the mixture is foamy
  and too hot for your finger.  Then beat over cold water for 3-4
  minutes until the mixture is cool and again forms the ribbon. It will
  have the consistency of mayonnaise. Melt the chocolate with coffee
  over hot water. Remove from heat and beat in the butter a bit at a
  time, to make a smooth cream. Beat the chocolate into the egg yolks
  and sugar, then beat in the optional orange peel.  Beat the egg
  whites and salt until soft peaks are formed sprinkle on the sugar and
  beat until stiff peaks are formed. Stir 1/4 of the egg whites into
  the chocolate mixture. Fold in the rest. Turn into serving dish,
  dessert cups or petits pots. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or
  overnight. Pass the sauce or whipped cream separately. Source:

 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------------MOUSSELINE------------------------------
      8 oz Salmon, fresh
     16 oz Scallops, fresh
      3 lg Eggs
    1/2 qt Cream, heavy
    1/2 tb Truffles, chopped, (opt)
      1 oz Butter, melted
           Salt (to taste)
           Pepper (to taste)
           Nutmeg (to taste)
     16    Ramekins for individual
           -- servings (small molds
           -- can be used instead)

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      1 ts Shallots, finely chopped
      2 tb Vinegar
    1/2 c  Wine, Muscadet
    1/4 c  Cream, heavy
    1/2 lb Butter, unsalted
           Pepper, white (to taste)

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
      1 bn Spinach, shredded
      1 bn Watercress, shredded
      1 ts Butter
 
  For the Mousseline: ===================
  
       Grind the scallops and the shrimp (separately) in a meat grinder
  or food processor, then cool both in the refrigerator for 1/2 hour.
  
       Place the scallops in a bowl with 1 egg, 1 egg white (reserve
  the yolk for the salmon), salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Put the scallop
  mixture in a food processor and run for 1 minute. Slowly add cream
  until blended (about 3 seconds).  Do not overblend or mixture will be
  buttery.
  
       Add truffles to scallop mixture and set aside.
  
       Place the salmon in a processor bowl with the other egg, the
  reserved egg yolk, salt and pepper. Process for 1 minute.
  
       Butter the ramekins or molds, then spoon the scallop mixture into
  them.  Put the salmon mixture into a piping tube and pump the mixture
  into the center of the mold (or simply pour mixtures into the mold.)
  
       Place the ramekins or molds in a shallow pan containing 1 inch of
  water; cover the pan with aluminum foil pierced with small holes to
  allow steam to escape. Bake in a 350 F oven for 30 minutes.
  
  For the Sauce: ==============
  
       Put the shallots, vinegar, and wine into small saucepan and cook
  until half of the liquid is gone.
  
       Add cream and bring to a boil, then whip.
  
       Add butter in small pieces and whisk over medium heat. Remove
  from heat and adjust the seasonings.
  
  For the Garnish: ================
  
       Saute spinach and watercress in butter for 1 minute. On hot
  serving plates, arrange some of the spinach and watercress in small
  circles the same size as the ramekins or molds. Unmold the
  scallop-salmon mousse onto the vegetables, top with sauce(s).
  
       Note: You may use a combination of sauces to form a design on the
  plate (American sauce, genoise sauce, tomato sauce can be used
  interchangeably).

  WHAT TO DO:  Ask a grown-up helper to boil the water and stir in the
  sugar and syrup.  Let it reach a hard boil. Boil six minutes. This
  will be extremely hot - over 300 degrees - and very dangerous.
  Carefully pour it onto a clean plate.  Let cool for an hour and it

      Title: MOZZARELLA CHEESE
 Categories: 
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------CRAFT OF THE COUNTRY COOK----------------------
      2 ga Milk, pasteurized and
           -cooled to 90^F
      7 tb Cultured buttermilk
      6 tb Yogurt
           -rennet to coagulate 2
           -gallons milk (1/2 Hansens
           -tablet) dissolved in about
    1/2 c  Cold water.
 
  Usually makes 4 half pound cheeses.
  
  Mozzarella is one of several kinds of "plastic-curd" cheeses,
  originating in Italy. In making them the curds are kneaded, which
  expels whey and produces plasticity. Because of their dense texture
  they keep well in warm climates and are ideal for smoking.
  
  Provolone is an aged version of a plastic-curd cheese. Mozzarella is
  one of the most versatile cheeses to make at home, since it tastes
  wonderful freshly made, freezes well, and can be used like an aged
  cheese in cooking, melting readily when heated.
  
  Start this cheese in the evening. Maintain the milk at 90^F in a
  double boiler. Mix the buttermilk and yogurt separately with a little
  of the milk to remove lumps, then blend into the rest of the milk.
  Add the rennet solution and mix thoroughly. Let sit until the curd
  sets and breaks clearly when tested with a finger - about 20 to 30
  minutes. Cut the curd into 1/2 inch cubes as evenly as possible.
  Maintain at 90^F for 15 minutes, stirring with a clean hand. The
  curds are fragile because they have not been cooked, so stir very
  gently, just enough to keep them from matting together. Gently pour
  the curds into a cloth lined colander. When the whey has drained, the
  curd should be in one solid piece. Rinse in cold water, then soak in
  a pan of cold water for 15 minutes. If it is a big batch, cut the
  curd into several blocks, 4 or 5 inches square. Drain off most of the
  water, then refrigerate the curds, or keep in a cool, 40^F place.
  Leave them in a colander or other container that allows drainage.
  (Commercially, mozzarella curds are shipped to delicatessens at this
  stage, where the cheese is finished.) The next day, warm the cheese
  to room temperature so it will ripen, or become more acidic. After an
  hour or so, test the cheese for acidity as follows. Cut off a small
  piece of cheese and cut it into three 1/2 inch cubes. Heat several
  cups of water in a sauce pan to 165^F. Put in the cubes and stir for
  5 minutes. Remove the cubes and mold them together like modeling
  clay. Reheat the lump of cheese in the water for a minute, then
  remove and work or mold it together a little more. After repeating
  several times, try to pull the curd apart. If it breaks or tears, and
  clouds the water, it is underripe. Wait an hour or so and test again.
  When it pulls into a long rope and can be molded together again, it
  is ready. It will have a glossy surface and* will cloud the water
  only slightly. The whole cheese is treated somewhat like the test
  sample to finish it. Cut it into small cubes and put them in a pan.
  Heat water to 170^F and pour enough over them, to cover the curds by
  about 2 inches. Keep a thermometer in the pan and let the temperature
  drop to 135^F. Press the cubes together, and then knead the cheese,
  by stretching and pulling it, as if working modelling clay. It should
  become "plastic" and stretch into long strands. When it does, shape
  into half pound balls, or make a thick rope, fold it in half, and
  twist several times to make a decorative oblong cheese. Mozzarella
  can be dipped in hot water to make a glossy surface, or wrapped in
  cheese cloth to protect it. To keep the cheese very fresh tasting for
  up to a week, keep it in a bowl of water in the refrigerator, and
  change the water every day. To salt mozzarella for longer keeping, or
  to prepare it for smoking, soak it in brine for 4 or 5 hours (See
  Brined Cheese) The whey from mozzarella is perfect for making ricotta
  because it does not have a chance to develop much acidity.
  
  Smoked Mozzarella: Mozzarella and other firm cheeses can be cold
  smoked for flavor. Salting and smoking both help preserve the cheese
  by drying it, and discouraging bacteria and insects. Set the cheese
  on a rack in the smoker, or wrap in cheesecloth and hang it. Keep the
  temperature below 90^F to prevent sweating off butterfat or melting.
  Smoke at 60 to 85^F for 4 to 15 hours.
  
  Brined Cheese: Press the cheese for 5 or 6 hours, or overnight,
  without salting it. Make enough brine to cover the cheese by about an
  inch, using 4.1/2 Tablespoons of plain salt for every quart of water
  needed. Soak the cheese from 12 to 24 hours. A small cheese requires
  less time than a large one. Turn the cheese once or twice to ensure
  that the brine penetrates all sides. Drain for about an hour on a
  cloth covered rack. Cover and refrigerate. Keeps for a week or more,
  longer than most fresh cheeses.

  Boil turtle meat until tender; reduce stock and clarify. Add
  ingredients for stock pot. To stock pot add carrots, onions, celery,
  Burgundy, and Povirade sauce. Tighten with gelatin. This recipe will
  yield approximately 10 gallons. Under refrigeration, the soup will

    1/3 c  Whole-meal, whole-wheat

      1 c  Warm milk
      1 c  Warm water
           (Note that you may use the
           -water that was used to soak
           -the
           Wheat berries.)
           Knead well, adding
           -additional:
           White flour
 
  Another recipe from James Beard's book, "Beard On Bread". About this
  bread James Beard says, "I learned to make this bread in Norway, at
  Mrs Ovenstad's farm near Oslo. She bakes it twice a week, and though
  she resorts to heating the dough over steam for the second rising, it
  comes out beautifully. She is also a deft pastry cook and gardner,
  and loves to eat. (2 large Loaves)"
  
  about 1/2 cup at a time.  You may need to add 3 more cups, give or
  take a bit.
  
  Form into a ball, place into a greased bowl, turn and cover. Allow to
  rise until doubled in bulk, probably about 1 hour.
  
  Punch down and knead 10 minutes, then cut into two equal pieces, form
  loaves, and allow to rise again.
  
  You may elect to allow the bread to rise a second time in the bowl.
  If so, James Beard feels that the bread may need some help in the
  second rising, in the form of a bit of heat. I am not so sure, as
  this was a very willing bread dough.  Then again, I almost always
  rise my bread in a Microwave oven anyway.
  
  As to baking, this bread requires about 1 hour in a 400 F. oven.
  
  This bread should have a good crunchy crust.
  
  I have made this loaf without the wheat berries, as the crust and
  bread is delightful without the berries, and some members of the
  family refer to soft berries as "erasers" and hard berries as "rocks"
  ~ refusing to eat bread with either.  However, with a bit of
  practice, you will be able to use the wheat berries at the right
  point so they will be neither "rocks" or "erasers".

  1. Grind ham and chicken, a little at a time, with just enough tomato
  juice to keep mixture from clogging blender, or put meats through
  medium blade of meat grinder without tomato juice. Set aside.
  2. Fry bacon in a large, heavy skillet over low heat until crisp.
  Remove bacon, drain, and crumble. Set aside.
  3. In bacon fat in skillet, cook onion until soft. Add tomatoes and
  ground ham and chicken. Cook until tomatoes are very soft. Stir in
  seasonings and crumbled bacon. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
  Serves 8-10 with barbecued meat; 6 as shortcake.
  NOTE: Mrs. Neal Leuty, one of Plains' best cooks, serves this unusual
  and unusually good stew in two ways; as an accompaniment to barbecued
  fresh pork or chicken along with potato salad, or served with corn
  bread squares, split and toasted, as a main course shortcake. Believe
  me - and you will when you try it - this is positively scrumptious
  served either way.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Lean beef -- cut in small
           Dice
           Oil
           Onions
      1    Clove garlic -- chopped
           Fine
      1 tb Flour
      2 tb Espagnole
      1 ts Ground oregano
      1 ts Ground cumin
      1 ts Ground coriander
           Dried whole peppers
           Cooked beans
 
  This may be the earliest printed recipe for chili con carne and it is
  surprisingly authentic, save for the suspect addition of "espagnole",
  white sauce seasoned with hame, carrot, onion, celery, and clove. The
  words are Mrs. Owen's own.
  
  This might be called the national dish of Mexico. Literally, it means
  'pepper with meat' and when prepared to suit the taste of the average
  Mexican, is not misnamed. Take lean beef and cut in small dice, put
  to cook with a little oil. When well braised, add some onions, a
  clove of garlic chopped fine and one tablespoon flour. Mix and cover
  with water or stock and two tablespoons espagnole, 1 teaspoon each of
  ground oregano, camino, and coriander. The latter can be purchased at
  any drug store. Take dried whole peppers and remove the seeds, cover
  with water and put to boil and when thoroughly cooked pass through a
  fine strainer. Add sufficient puree to the stew to make it good and
  hot, and salt to taste. To be served with a border of Mexican beans
  (frijoles), well cooked in salted water.
  
  Frijoles or Mexican brown beans. Boil beans in an earthen vessel
  until soft (four to eight hours). Mash and put them into a frying pan
  of very hot lard and fry until comparatively dry and light brown.
  Sometimes chopped onions are put into the lard before the beans are
  added and sometimes pods of red pepper or grated cheese.

      Title: MRS. PETTIGREW'S LEMON CAKE (GFDM86A)
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2    Lemons
    3/4 c  Sugar
      8 tb (1 stick) soft butter
      2    Large eggs, beaten
    3/4 c  Flour
      6 tb Milk
      3 tb Sugar, for topping
 
  Preheat oven to 325 F. Grease and line a 7 inch round cake pan or 8
  inch loaf pan with parchment or wax paper. Grate the lemon rinds and
  set aside. Combine the juice of 1 lemon with 3 T sugar in bowl and
  set in a warm place until the sugar dissolves and forms a syrup with
  the juice. Cream the margarine and the rest of the sugar together
  until light and fluffy. Add the beaten eggs, a little at a time,
  beating well after each addition. Stir in the grated lemon rind and
  flour then beat again thoroughly (the longer you beat, the softer the
  cake). Add the milk and beat again. Pour into the prepared pan and
  bake for at least 1 hour. The cake should spring back when pressed
  gently in the center. Immediately upon removing the cake from the
  oven, prick the top with a long-tined fork or thin skewer and pour
  the lemon juice-sugar syrup all over the top until completely
  covered. Cool the pan to allow the syrup to be soaked up and create a
  moist and tangy cake. Annette Thompson.

      Title: MRS. REGAN'S PERSIMMON PUDDING
 Categories: Fruits, Puddings, Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Butter
      1 c  Flour
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Cinnamon, ground
    1/4 ts Nutmeg, ground
      1 c  Persimmon pulp
      2 ts Baking soda
      2 ts Water, warm
      3 tb Brandy
      1 ts Vanilla
      2    Eggs
      1 c  Raisins
    1/2 c  Walnuts, chopped
 
  Stir together sugar and melted butter.  Re-sift flour with salt,
  cinnamon, and nutmeg and add to butter mixture. Add persimmon pulp,
  baking soda dissolved in warm water, brandy, and vanilla. Add eggs,
  mixing lightly but thoroughly.  Add raisins and nuts, stirring just
  until mixed.
  
  Turn into buttered 6 cup heat-proof mold.  Cover and place on wire
  rack in kettle.  Pour in enough boiling water to reach halfway up
  side of mold. Cover kettle and simmer 2-1/2 to 3 hours. Let stand a
  few minutes.
  
  Unmold onto serving dish. Pour 1/4 c warmed brandy over pudding and
  flame. Serve with whipped cream.
  
  Sylvia's notes: I used the rice bowl to my steamer, and the pudding
  was overdone after 40 minutes!  A heavy, moist, not overly sweet
  pudding. I couldn't really taste the persimmon. If I make it again,
  I'll definitely give it 5 minutes less in the steamer, although it
  didn't taste burnt, it's a deep brown-black on the outside.
