 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------STARTER-------------------------------
      2 c  Water
      2 c  Flour
      1 pk Yeast

MMMMM----------------------SOURDOUGH BREAD---------------------------
      4 c  Flour
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Sugar
      2 tb Grease
 
  Starter:
  
  Combine the three ingredients and let sit over night in a warm place.
  
  Use of Starter:  Each time you use the starter, pour off 1/2 cup or
  more to use in you next baking effort. Do not keep starter in a metal
  container. A glass or potter container works best. The starter will
  usually keep for several months in the refrigerator but frequent use
  will renew the starter and keep it fresh. Never add anything to your
  starter except plain flour and warm water.  Set starter the night
  before use by adding flour and water (2 cups each).  Remove your
  fresh cup of starter and use the bubbly batter in the bread recipe.
  
  Bread:
  
  Sift the dry ingredients into a bowl.  Pour in sponge and mix (also
  grease).  Knead the dough for ten minutes, then allow to rise for
  three to four hours. Disolve 1/4 teaspoon baking soda in 1 Tb. water
  then knead into dough.  Allow to rise again.  Shape into loaves and
  bake at 375 degress F. for 45 minutes.

      Title: OLD WHITE CUT PORK SLICES WITH GARLIC SESAME
 Categories: Chinese, Meats
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      8 c  To 10 cups water
  1 1/2 lb Boneless leg of pork, pork
           -butt or loin
      2    Green onions, crushed
      3    Quarter-sized slices fresh
           -ginger, crushed
      2    Garlic cloves, crushed
    1/4 c  Shao-Hsing rice wine, or dry
           -sherry
           Fresh coriander sprigs for
           -garnish
           GARLIC SESAME SAUCE:
      1 ts Finely minced garlic (about
           -2 small cloves)
    1/2 ts Fresh minced ginger (about 2
           -quarter-sized slices)
      1 tb Dark soy sauce
      1 tb Light soy sauce
    1/2 ts Hot pepper oil, or to taste
      1 ts Asian sesame oil
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
      2 ts Rice vinegar
      2 tb Minced fresh coriander or
           -green onion
 
  Fresh ham or a fairly fat cut of pork is traditionally used for this
  recipe, but boneless lean pork loin makes a delicious and leaner
  substitute. For a nontraditional presentation, serve the pork with
  grilled asparagus spears, Asian eggplant and/or zucchini slices. Or,
  arrange the slices on a bed of watercress with strips of roasted
  pepper and serve as a first course salad. Or, simply alternate the
  pork with thin rounds of chilled cucum- ber.
  
  Bring the water to a boil in a large pot, then add the pork, green
  onions, ginger, garlic and wine. Bring to a boil again. Skim off the
  scum that rises to surface. Cover, reduce heat low and simmer for 45
  minutes.
  
  When the meat is done, half fill a large pan with cold water and ice
  cubes. Remove the meat from the pot and immediately plunge it into
  the ice water; let sit for 20 minutes to firm up the meat and juices.
  Remove pork, pat dry, cover and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled,
  at least 2 to 3 hours, or overnight.
  
  Garlic Sesame Sauce: Mix together all ingredients.
  
  To serve: Cut the meat crosswise into paper-thin slices (no thicker
  than 1/8 inch) and arrange in a circular pattern on a plate. Serve
  sauce on the side or drizzle it over the pork. Garnish with fresh
  coriander eaves.

 Categories: Chicken
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Boneless Chicken breasts
           Seasoned bread crumbs
           Munster cheese -- sliced
           Wine
 
  This is one of those recipes that you use "enough for your family".
  For 2 adults I use 3 breasts and cheese slices. Maybe about 1/3 C
  crumbs and less than 1/4 C wine. I use Non-alchol wine, zinfandel. No
  specific kind was mentioned. Using a meat mallet or heavy cup, pound
  the chicken to flatten somewhat. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Dredge
  (coat) chicken withcrumbs. Place in baking dish single layer.
  Sprinkle with about 1-2 Tablespoons wine. Bake for 20-30 minutes.
  Take out and place a slice of cheese on each piece of chicken.
  Sprinkle with 2-3 Tablespoons wine. Turn oven up to 350 and Bake
  another 20-30 minutes. You will be surprised how good this simple
  dish is! Source:  Mr. Food on a radio program 12/94. Formatted for MM

  loaf pan.
  
  Bake at 300 degrees F. for 2 hours or until done (it will separate

  Melt (do not boil) butter. Add rum and sugar. Stir by hand. Remove
  the cake from the oven and pour half of the glaze over it. Let it
  cool 25 minutes, then turn it over and pour the remaining glaze on
  the other side.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A traditional European-style fruit cake -- Although fruitcakes
  have a bad reputation, this one is *excellent*. My mother has been
  making it for years. She originally got the recipe from a friend, but
  has since adapted it to suit her fans. (She gets requests for it all
  year long.)
  
  *  Don't use glass pans.  This freezes well, if you make more than
  you can eat; just be sure to wrap it carefully so it doesn't get
  freezer burn. Warm frozen cake in the oven, not the microwave.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 2 hours baking, 30 minutes finishing.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

           -dough
    1/2    To 1 cup Lemon Cheese
           -(recipe below)
           Grated rind of 1 lemon
      1    Egg white
      1 ts Lemon extract
 
  Sugar
  
  * Use Grated Raw Potato Starter Prepare Lemon Cheese ahead of time.
  Flatten ball of dough, sprinkle grated rind and lemon extract over it
  and knead it until well distributed. Roll dough out very thin (about
  1/8 inch) and cut into 3- inch, or larger, rounds. Place on lightly
  greased flat pans so that they will not touch. Let stand about 10
  minutes. Press centers to make slight depression to hold 1/2 tsp.
  Lemon Cheese (more for larger rounds). Spread beaten egg white around
  rim and sprinkle lightly with sugar. Bake in oven preheated to 350
  for at least 30 minutes until delicately tinted and the glaze has
  crystallized.  The longer they are left in the oven to become drier
  and crispier the more delicious they are.
  
  Lemon Cheese:  Mix together in saucepan 2 cups white sugar, grated
  rind and juice of 3 large lemons, 3 large whole eggs (beaten), 1/4
  tsp salt and 1/4 cup butter. Cook over slow heat, stirring constantly
  until thick. Yield: about 2-1/2 to 3 cups.  This can be sealed in
  jars to keep like jelly or will keep indefinitely in covered
  container in refrigerator. It can be used as topping for baked
  puddings, fillings for tarts and jelly rolls.

  OLD WORLD RYE BREAD from Salday Products (vis CI$).
  
  Sour sponge:
       1pkg yeast
        2 c  warm water
      1/2 T  malt syrup or sugar
        2 c  medium rye flour
        1 T  caraway seeds
  
  Dissolve yeast and malt/sugar in water.  Add rye flour and seeds, and
  mix well until all ingredients are blended. Cover bowl of sponge mix
  with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 24 hrs, not
  longer than 36 hrs.
  
  BREAD DOUGH:
       1 pkg yeast            1 T salt
       1 1/2 c warm water     1 c medium rye flour
       1/2 c molasses         6 c bread flour (I use some whole wheat in
       3 T shortening                               this amount.
       1 egg                   TOPPING: 1 egg beaten
       1 T caraway seeds                2 T milk Transfer aged sponge to
  larger mixing bowl and add yeast, water, molasses, seeds, egg,
  shortening, and mix until all ingredients are well blended. Add salt,
  rye and bread flours, and mix until rough dough is well developed.
  Remove rough dough from bowl and place on a floured counter top.
  Rough dough must be further kneaded until smooth. Use a heavy rolling
  pin and flatten dough using four as needed to avoid sticking to
  rolling pin. Fold dough over and reapeat rolling dough until
  smoothness is achieved. Cover smooth dough with plastic wrap and let
  rest 10 minutes. Divide dough into three equal parts and roll into a
  ball, cover with a container or plastic wrap and proof for 1 hour or
  until double.
  
  Remove dough, punch down, mold into a ball flattened at the top and
  proof in a covered container for about 1 hour or until almost
  doubled. Remove from container and gently place on a peel or cookie
  sheet sprinkled with cornmeal. Paint top with egg-milk mixture,
  sprinkle more caraway seed on top, cut three lines on top with razor
  and gently slide on to tiles preheated in oven at 375 degrees. Bake
  for about 35 to 45 minutes until golden brown.
  
  I have seen this made in a bread machine also by dividing the
  quantities in thirds but using a couple of teaspoons of yeast per
  loaf. Be sure and check your dough in the machine as my memory may
  fail me as to the downsizing.

      Title: OLD-CALIFORNIA EMPANADITAS
 Categories: Cheese/eggs, Mexican
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Butter
      1 pk (8 oz) Cream Cheese
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
      1    Egg yolk
      2 ts Cream or milk
 
  Beat butter, cheese and salt together in a mixer until completely
  smooth and blended.  Work in flour to a smooth dough. (You can use a
  mixer for this step, too, but results are superior if you work in the
  flour with your fingertips, a fork or rubber spatula). Flatten dough
  in foil to form a an 8 X 6 inch rectangle. Chill overnight. (You can
  chill it several days before using).  Remove from refrigerator 8 to
  10 minutes before rolling. (Many recipes suggest a 30 minute wait
  before rolling dough, but it's easier to handle when rolled as cold
  as possible). Divide dough for ease in rolling and to insure cold
  dough.
  
  Keep unrolled portion in refrigerator until ready to use. Roll on
  floured pastry cloth with floured rolling pin or between two sheets
  of waxed paper. The former is easier, in my opinion, and I find
  absolutely no sticking when I use a pastry cloth and covered pin. I
  first rub cloth and pin well with flour, then shake out excess. When
  using waxed paper, loosen it on both sides of pastry several times as
  you roll.
  
  Shape as directed in specific recipes and chill before baking. Brush
  tops (only) of all pastries with egg yolk beaten with cream. Bake in
  moderate oven (350 degrees) unless otherwise specified.

      Title: OLD-FASHIONED GINGER BEER
 Categories: Alcohol, Beverages, New (to be
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -----For The Starter-----
    1/2 oz Yeast
      2 ts Sugar
           --To Feed The "Plant"-----
      7 ts Ground Ginger
      7 ts Sugar
           -----To Flavour-----
  1 1/2 lb Sugar
           Juice Of 2 Lemons
 
  Mix starter ingredients with 3/4 pint of warm water in a glass jar.
  Stir, cover and leave in a warm place for 24 hours. This is your
  starter "plant".
  
  Feed the "plant" with 1 teaspoon each of ground ginger and sugar each
  day.
  
  After 7 days strain through a fine sieve.  Dissolve the sugar in 2
  pints of water.  Add the lemon juice and the liquid from the "plant".
  Dilute with 5 pints of water, mix well and store in corked bottles
  for at least 7 days.
  
  Use strong bottles as pressure may build up which will cause thin
  bottles to explode.  For the same reason use corked bottles rather
  than those with a more secure closure that will not 'give' under
  pressure.
  
  Ross requested a recipe for ginger beer.  This is a recipe that I have
  often used and it produces a really old-fashioned drink. It is quite
  a long process but well worth the effort. The amount of sugar in the
  final stage can be varied according to taste.  Please excuse the use
  of Imperial measures - I am only a poor ignorant pom.

      1 c  Finely chopped pecans
    1/2 c  Light corn syrup
      8 tb Butter
    2/3 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
 
  These cylinders-of-lace cookies are a lovely accompaniment to a fruit
  or custard, or may be enjoyed all by themselves. You can also whip
  cream and pipe it into the delicate cylinders.
  
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Sift the flour and toss with the chopped pecans.
  Combine the corn syrup, butter and brown sugar in a saucepan. Bring
  the mixture to the boil over moderate heat, stirring constantly.
  Remove the pan from the heat. Gradually stir in the flour and nut
  mixture. Cool slightly. Drop the batter by level teaspoonfuls about 3
  inches apart on a non-stick cookie sheet. Bake 5-to-6 minutes, or
  until most of the bubbling stops and the cookies are a caramel color.
  Remove them from the oven and let them cool on the sheet just until
  they can be handled. While the cookies are still hot, remove each in
  turn and roll it into a cylinder around the handle of a wooden spoon.
  If they are too hard to be rolled, return them to the oven for a
  minute to soften them slightly. If they break, eat them. These freeze
  well in a tight container.

  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Trim excess fat from the chuck roast.
  Dredge the roast with flour and season with salt and pepper. Place a
  heavy-bottomed casserole over medium heat and add the oil. When hot,
  add the meat and brown well on all sides. Remove the meat; add the
  carrots and onions and cook until browned. Return the meat to the
  pot; add the stock, wine, thyme and bay leaf. When the liquid comes
  to a simmer, cover the pot and place on the lower shelf of the
  preheated oven. Bake for about 2 hours, turning the meat once or
  twice during cooking. Toss the prepared vegetables with the olive oil
  or fat and season with salt and pepper. About 40 minutes before
  serving, place the vegetables in a roasting pan, put in the oven and
  roast until they are tender and lightly browned.
  
  When the meat is tender, remove to a platter and keep warm.
  
  Strain the juices from the pot and skim off the fat. Return the
  juices to the pot and cook over high heat until reduced to about half.
  
  Reduce heat to a simmer; drop dumpling dough by the teaspoonful into
  the simmering juices. Cover and simmer about 10 minutes, or until a
  toothpick inserted into a dumpling comes out clean.
  
  Surround the roast with the vegetables and the dumplings. Pour the
  remaining juices from the pot into a sauce boat, Spoon a little over
  the meat before serving.

      Title: OLD-FASHIONED POTATO PAN ROLLS
 Categories: Bread, Rolls, Fp
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
  3 3/4 c  All-purpose flour, or bread
      1 pk Active dry yeast
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      6 tb Cold butter or margarine;
           -cut into chunks
    1/2 c  Freshly mashed potatoes
    3/4 c  Milk
      1    Egg
           Butter; melted
 
  Recipe by: the California Culinary Academy Preparation Time: 0:45
  
  1. In a food processor fitted with a steel blade, process 3-1/4 cups
  flour, the yeast, sugar, and salt just to blend. With on/off pulsing,
  cut in butter finely, until it almost disappears.
  
  2. In a separate bowl, mix together mashed potato, milk, and egg. With
  processor motor running, quickly add potato mixture to yeast mixture.
  Process until mixture comes away from the side of the bowl.
  
  3. Process 30 seconds to knead dough. If dough is sticky, add more
  flour and process 15 to 30 seconds longer. Dough should feel tacky,
  smooth, elastic, and warm but not hot.
  
  4. Remove dough from processor and shape into a ball. Place ball in an
  oiled bowl, turn to cover it with oil, and cover bowl with plastic
  wrap or a damp towel. Let dough rise until doubled in bulk.
  
  5. Punch dough down. Let rest 5 minutes. Divide dough into 24 pieces
  (approximately 1-1/4 ounces each). Shape each piece into a ball,
  tucking the edges under to draw the surface of the dough tight.
  Arrange the dough in 2 round cake or pie pans. Cover loosely with
  plastic wrap or a damp towel and let rise until doubled in bulk.
  
  6. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Brush tops with melted butter. Bake
  until golden brown (20 to 30 minutes). Remove from pan to cool on a
  wire rack. Brush tops again with melted butter.
  
  Makes 2 dozen rolls.

 Categories: Desserts, Fruits/nuts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 qt Strawberries
    1/3 c  Sugar
      1 tb Lemon juice
  1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
           Buttermilk Biscuit Dough
           -(RECIPE Follows)
      2 tb Buttermilk
      2 tb Sugar
      2 tb Soft butter

MMMMM------------------BUTTERMILK BISCUIT DOUGH-----------------------
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Cake flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 c  Cold unsalted butter
    3/4 c  Buttermilk or heavy cream
           - (or more)
 
  PLACE BERRIES in a colander and quickly rinse under running cold
  water. Pour on a tray lined with several thicknesses of paper towel
  to drain for 5 minutes. Hull the strawberries with the point of a
  stainless-steel paring knife, then slice into a bowl. Sprinkle with
  sugar and lemon juice, then set aside, covered, at room temperature
  for an hour or two. Whip the cream (add a couple tablespoons of
  sugar, if you like) until it holds a soft peak. Cover and
  refrigerate. Preheat the oven to 450F; set rack in middle level.
  Prepare biscuit dough. For a large shortcake, pat the dough into a
  9-inch disk on a parchment-lined cookie sheet. For individual
  shortcakes, pat dough into a 6-by-12- inch rectangle and cut into
  eight 3-inch biscuits with a sharp, floured knife. Transfer to a
  parchment-lined cookie sheet. Paint tops with buttermilk. Sprinkle
  with sugar. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until well risen and golden.
  Check the center of the large shortcake with a toothpick to make sure
  it is baked through: If the pick emerges with dough still clinging to
  it, lower temperature to 350F and bake another 5 minutes. Slide the
  large shortcake onto a platter immediately after it is baked. Use a
  sharp, serrated knife to slice through the middle, making two layers.
  Slide the edge of a cookie sheet between the two layers and lift the
  top layer off. Butter the bottom layer and pour all but 1/2 cup of the
  sweetened berries on. Slide the top back on and pour the remaining
  berries over the top. Split the small shortcakes in the same way and
  place the bottoms on individual dessert plates. Butter them and top
  with about 1/3 cup of the berry mixture. Replace tops and pour a
  tablespoon or so of the remaining berries over the top. Serve
  immediately. Pass the cream in a bowl for the guests to help
  themselves. BUTTERMILK BISCUIT DOUGH: COMBINE THE FLOURS, salt and
  baking powder in a mixing bowl and stir well to mix. Rub in the
  butter by hand or with a pastry blender until the mixture is mealy.
  Stir in 3/4 cup of the buttermilk with a fork and continue stirring
  gently until the dough begins to hold together. (If the dough is dry,
  add more buttermilk, 1 tablespoon at a time.) Sprinkle the work
  surface generously with flour and scrape the dough onto it. Fold the
  dough over on itself two or three times. Use the dough immediately
  for shortcakes, following the instructions above. Use this recipe to
  make a large shortcake or eight small ones. This same dough is used
  as the topping in cobbler recipes.

   NOTE: I have found the cook time is not accurate to go by. It takes
  me longer to get it done. I usually put it on to cook overnight on
  LOW and continue cook on LOW through the day until done. You might
  want to experiment. When done, the roast literally falls apart. Serve
  it on buns. Add chips and a fresh fruit salad and you're all set.

  This is the author's last choice for making a starter, but seems to
  be in all the cookbooks dealing with Sourdough Starters. Use only as
  a last resort.
  
  NOTE:
  
  All containers for starters not using yeast, must be carefully scalded
  before use.  If you are careless or do not scald them the starter will
  fail.

      Title: OLDE TYMES FAMOUS SAUSAGE GRAVY
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      5 c  Water
      7 c  Milk
      1 lb Pork sausage
  1 1/2 c  Flour
      2 tb Salt
      2 tb Pepper
 
  Mix water and milk in a stock pot. Place on the stove to heat. Do not
  boil! The sausage needs to be chopped. If you use links, put them
  through a food chopper. If you use bulk, then chop and stir while
  cooking. The sausage should be fried in a cast iron skillet. When it
  is done, carefully strain and save the grease. Put the cooked sausage
  in the milk and water mixture. Put the grease back in the skillet
  over moderate heat. Stir in the flour, salt and pepper to make your
  roux. Cook this mixture until it will cling to the spoon and come off
  the skillet cleanly. When the milk and water mixture is just under
  boiling, stir in the roux quickly while turning off the heat to
  thicken the gravy. Serve over biscuits or toast.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
    1/2 c  Brown rice flour (see note)
  1 1/2 ts Granular yeast
      2 ts Sugar
  1 1/4 c  Warm water (110 degrees F.)
      4 lg Egg whites, at room
           -temperature
      1 tb Olive oil
     12    Oil-cured black olives,
           -pitted and roughly chopped
      4 ts Dried rosemary, or to taste
      1    Egg yolk mixed with 1/2
           -teaspoon water
      1 lg Garlic clove, peeled, cut in
           -3 pieces
    1/2 c  Corn flour (see note)
    1/2 c  Cornstarch
      2 ts Xanthan gum powder
      1    To 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
 
  Stir together 1/2 cup of the rice flour, the yeast, sugar and 1/2 cup
  of the warm water in a 2-cup glass measure. Let rest in a warm place
  until doubled in volume, about 10 minutes.
  
  Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and draw two 8 inch
  circles on it (use a cake pan as a guide).
  
  Beat egg whites lightly, add olive oil, chopped olives and 2
  teaspoons of the rosemary; set aside.
  
  Combine garlic and egg yolk; set aside. (Garlic will perfume the
  glaze but won't burn in the oven, as chopped garlic would.)
  
  Combine remaining 1 cup rice flour, the corn flour, corn- starch,
  xanthan gum powder and salt in bowl.
  
  Add remaining 3/4 cup warm water to egg white-olive mixture a stir
  into flour. Stir in yeast mixture and beat until smooth.
  
  Using a rubber spatula, spread soft dough into 8-inch circles marked
  on the parchment paper heaping it up slightly in the middle. Cover
  loaves with lightly greased plastic wrap and let rise until doubled
  in bulk, about 1 hour.
  
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
  
  Discard garlic and brush egg glaze over loaves. Sprinkle tops with
  remaining 2 teaspoons rosemary. Using a razor blade, slash tops of
  loaves into a large diamond grid pattern. (Use an up-and-down cutting
  motion rather than dragging the blade through the soft dough.)
  
  Bake for 20 minutes, until well browned.
  
  Makes two 8-inch diameter, 11-ounce loaves.
  
  Note: Brown rice flour and corn flour may be found in some health food
  stores and Rainbow Groceries.

      Title: OLIVE & THYME BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ts Active dry yeast
  1 1/2 c  Water -- 105-115 degrees
  1 1/4 c  Basic bread sponge
  3 1/4 c  All-purpose flour --
           Unbleached
    1/3 c  All-purpose flour -- for
           Kneading
      4 ts Kosher salt
    1/2 c  Kalamata olives -- pit &
           Chop roughly
      4 ts Fresh thyme -- coarsely
           Chopped
 
  Can use any fleshy black olive in place of Kalamatas.
  
  In a bowl, dissolve  the yeast in the water.  Allow to proof for three
  minutes.
  
  Stir the sponge into the water, breaking the sponge up using your
  hands or a spoon.
  
  Add 3 1/4 cups of the flour and salt and mix, scraping and folding
  until the dough gathers into a single mass. Mix in the olives and
  thyme until distributed. This dough will be wet and sticky.
  
  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead as much
  of the 1/3 cup of flour as is required to make a smooth and elastic
  dough.
  
  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and
  refrigerate overnight.
  
  Halve the dough and shape each piece into a ball and place in an
  oiled bowl and cover with plastic.  Allow to rise in a draft-free
  location for two hours.
  
  Turn out each piece of the dough onto a lightly floured work surface
  and press out any large bubbles. Shape each half into a loose oval.
  Transfer each of the ovals into a 9x5 loaf pan, with the seam on the
  bottom. Cover again with plastic and allow to double in bulk, which
  should take 2 to 2
      1/2    hours.
  
  Preheat the oven for at least thirty minutes along with a baking
  stone or tiles on the middle rack to 425. Place a baking pan with
  decent sides on the bottom shelf. Boil two cups of water. Place the
  loaf pans on the stones and then immediately pour the boiling water
  into the baking pan.
  
  Bake for 35-40 minutes until the loaves are hollow sounding when
  removed from the pans and tapped on the bottom. Take the loaves out
  of the pans and cool on a rack.

      Title: OLIVE BREAD PART 1
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
MMMMM-----------------COOKING WITH MASTER CHEFS----------------------
      7 c  Bread flour; a little more
           -if needed
      2 ts Raw wheat germ
      2 ts Fragrant dried thyme,
           -coarsely ground
  1 1/3 c  Grape starter
      2 c  Tap water, 70 degrees F
      1 tb Salt
      1 c  Greek Kalamata olives,
           -pitted and roughly
           -chopped
      1 c  Oil cured olives, pitted
           -and roughly chopped
      1 tb Active dry yeast
 
  Special equipment suggested: A food processor fitted with a steel
  blade (if your machine is too small for the proportions here, make
  the dough in two batches and combine them for the final
  hand-kneading) A dough scraper A 2X2 foot wooden, plastic, or marble
  work board surface Two wicker baskets about 10" across and 4" deep,
  lined with a clean dry cloth and lightly floured An instant meat
  thermometer A bread peel A pizza stone or ceramic bread tiles (you
  will find these in most good cookware departments, gourmet shops and
  catalogs)
  
  MIXING THE DOUGH AND FIRST MACHINE KNEADING: Measure the flour, wheat
  germ, thyme, and starter into the bowl of the processor. Add the
  optional dissolved yeast only if your starter was not fully alive
  ~-bubbly throughout--after its final feeding. (If you are using the
  yeast-batter alternative, you will not need the additional yeast.)
  Start the machine and slowly pour in the water, then the salt.
  Process until the dough masses and balls up and rotates under the
  cover for 10 to 15 revolutions. Uncover the processor bowl and
  inspect the dough; it should be fairly smooth, soft and a bit sticky
  when squeezed between thumb and finger. (If too wet and sticky,
  sprinkle in and process briefly a tablespoon or so of flour; if too
  stiff, process in droplets of water.)
  
  SECOND MACHINE KNEADING: Let the dough rest 5 to 10 minutes, allowing
  the flour particles to absorb the liquid. Proces again for 15 to 20
  revolutions, then uncover the machine.
  
  ADDING THE OLIVES AND PREPARATION FOR HAND KNEADING: Add the olives
  to the machine, and process into the dough with short on-off spurts.
  You just want to incorporate the olives, not chop them. Turn the
  dough onto a lightly floured board and knead by hand for several
  turns to be sure the olives are well incorporated, and that the dough
  is smooth. Divide in half with the scraper. Tuck all sides of each
  piece under itself and roate the dough briefly with your palms to
  form a ball shape. Cover with a clean, dry cloth and let the dough
  rest on the board for 15 minutes.
  
  FORMING THE DOUGH: One at a time, with the pams of your hands roll
  each ball of dough around, pulling the bottom against the board,
  creating tension to stretch the covering "skin" smoothly over the
  entire surface of the dough. If more tension is needed, spritz the
  surface of the dough with a little water. Cupping your hands around
  the ball and using pressure against the board, continue rotating
  until the ball is uniformly smooth, with no blisters or breaks. Turn
  the ball over, pinch the center of the bottom together to seal, and
  place pinched side down in a floured basket.
  
  LETTING THE DOUGH RISE--2 hours: Leave the baskets uncovered at room
  temperature for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the dough has started to
  rise. Enclose each basket in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

  SLASHING THE DOUGH: Gently invert each basket, catching the dough in
  your hand and laying it carefully on a lightly floured wooden peel.
  With a single-edged razor, make a quick slanting 1/2" slash in the
  top of the dough from one side to the other. Open the slash slightly
  with your fingers.
  
  BAKING THE BREAD--45 minutes. Spritz the oven liberally with water and
  close the door for 5 seconds to trap the steam. Then quickly open the
  door and slide the dough onto the hot baking surface, jerking away
  the peel. Immediately turn down the oven temperature to 450 F.
  Continue spritzing the oven with water every 3 minutes for first 15
  minutes of baking. When the breads are firm enough, rotate their
  positions to ensure more even coloring. Continue baking for about 30
  minutes. The cut should open up and the bread will rise to almost
  double its original size.
  
  WHEN IS IT DONE? The crust will be a deep golden brown, with visible
  small fermentation bubbles particularly around the base. When tapped
  on the bottom, the bread should make a hollow sound--the temperature
  on an instant thermometer plunged into the bottom of the bread should
  be 200 degrees F. Remove the bread to a rack to cool completely
  before slicing.
  
  Alternative overnight yeast batter: 1 package fresh or dried yeast
  1/4 cup tap water, in a 1 cup measure 1/4 t sugar 1 cup all-purpose
  flour 1 cup water, droplets more if needed
  
  Crumble or sprinkle the yeast over the water in the measure, whisk in
  the sugar, and let rise for several minutes until it begins to foam.
  Whisk it again, then scrape into a 2 quart glass or plastic
  container. Whisk in the cup of flour, then the water, to make a
  mixture the consistency of pancake batter. Set uncovered at room
  temperature for several hours, until it foams and produces bit heavy
  bubbles. Stir it up, and leave overnight. May be used in place of the
  Silverton starter in any of her recipes.
  
  AHEAD OF TIME NOTE: If not to be used the next day, cover and
  refrigerate. The batter will gradually turn into a sourdough; feed it
  and treat it in the same way as the finished Silverton starter.
  
  NOTES:  The type of olives is important. If you do not use firm enough
  olives they will dissolve into the bread causing a muddiness of
  flavor, and an excess of salt! I have a report of someone trying to
  use a DLC-7 SuperPro Cuisineart processor, which was a disaster! The
  starter oozed out of the bottom and it wouldn't knead the amount of
  flour and starter that's in the recipe. I use the Kitchenaid for this
  recipe with great success. It takes longer to knead, but is a much
  better alternative to a huge mess with the processor, plus I didn't
  have to do the recipe in two batches. I kept the dough pretty wet so
  I used only about 6 - 6
      1/2    cups of flour total.
  
  Julia Child's note: Nancy Silverton's sturdy olive bread has a
  delicious aroma of real olives, but not overpoweringly so. This time
  the dough has the feel of a regular conventioanl dough but is made
  with her famous grape starter. Olive bread is one of her customer's
  favorites--how fortunate we can now make it in our own kitchens.

      Title: OLIVE BREAD PART 2 ABM
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
 
  PREPARATIONS for BAKING: Take the baskets from the refrigerator and
  remove the wrapping. Let the dough warm almost to room temperature
  for 1 1/2 to 2 hours--it is important that it not be chilled. HALF AN
  HOUR BEFORE ESTIMATED BAKING TIME: Place the baking stone or tiles on
  the oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 500
  degrees F. SLASHING THE DOUGH: Gently invert each basket, catching
  the dough in your hand and laying it carefully on a lightly floured
  wooden peel. With a single-edged razor, make a quick slanting 1/2"
  slash in the top of the dough from one side to the other. Open the

  Spritz the oven liberally with water and close the door for 5 seconds
  to trap the steam. Then quickly open the door and slide the dough

  down the oven temperature to 450 F. Continue spritzing the oven with
  water every 3 minutes for first 15 minutes of baking. When the breads
  are firm enough, rotate their positions to ensure more even coloring.
  Continue baking for about 30 minutes. The cut should open up and the

  yeast 1/4 cup tap water, in a 1 cup measure 1/4 t sugar 1 cup
  all-purpose flour 1 cup water, droplets more if needed Crumble or
  sprinkle the yeast over the water in the measure, whisk in the sugar,
  and let rise for several minutes until it begins to foam. Whisk it

      Title: OLIVE BREAD WITH MINT & ONIONS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 tb Active dry yeast
    1/2 ts Sugar
  1 1/2 c  Warm water
    1/2 c  Whole wheat flour,
           -preferably coarsely ground
      3    To 3 1/2 cups white flour,
           -preferably unbleached
      3 tb Olive oil
      1 ts Salt
      1 sm Onion, chopped
      2 ts Dried mint
     12    Black Greek olives, pitted
           -and halved
           Corn meal
 
  Makes 1 large round loaf
  
  Make a sponge by dissolving the yeast and sugar in the warm water and
  stirring in the whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups of the white flour.
  Beat at least 50 strokes, then cover with plastic wrap and let stand
  anywhere from 1 to 6 hours.
  
  Stir all but a teaspoon of the olive oil into the dough, as well as
  the salt, the chopped onion, dried mint, and olives. Then work in
  remaining white flour until it becomes hard to stir.
  
  Turn the dough out onto a floured working surface and let rest while
  you clean out the bowl.  Knead dough for about 8 to 10 minutes,
  adding more flour as necessary, until the dough is resilient. Lightly
  oil the bowl, return the dough to it, turning to coat, and cover with
  plastic wrap. Let rise until double in volume - about 1 1/2 hours.
  
  Turn the dough out, punch it down, and form into a large round loaf.
  Place on a baking sheet sprinkled with corn meal. Cover loosely with
  a towel and let rise again until double - about 45 minutes. (Or let
  raise and bake in La Cloche.)
  
  If you have baking tiles in your oven, be sure they are good and hot
  by preheating the oven to 425 F during the last 30 minutes of the
  final rising.  Slip the loaf onto the tiles (if you're not using
  them, simply put the baking sheet in the preheated oven) and bake for
  15 minutes, then lower the heat to 350 F and bake another 35 minutes.
  Brush with the remaining olive oil and let cool on rack.

      Title: OLIVE FOUGASSE - BREADMAKER
 Categories: Abm
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
      1 tb Bread machine yeast
  2 1/2 c  Bread flour
      2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Warm milk
    1/2 c  Water
    1/4 c  Fruity olive oil, + extra
           -for coating the dough
    1/3 c  Chopped Nicoise or green
           -olives
 
  Combine the yeast, flour, sugar, salt, milk, water and 1/4 cup olive
  oil in the bread machine pan and process on the dough setting. At the
  end of the cycle, turn out the dough onto a lightly floured board and
  knead in the olives. Turn the bread pan over the dough and let it
  rest for 15 minutes.
  
  Divide the dough into two equal pieces and roll each piece into an 8
  ~by-10-inch rectangle. Place each rectangle on a parchment
  paper-covered baking sheet. Make two rows of 6 to 8 evenly spaced
  diagonal slashes, cutting all the way through the dough. Open these
  slits by pulling them well apart with your hands. Coat the flatbreads
  with olive oil and set aside to rise until the dough is puffed, about
       20    minutes.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375 F. After the breads are puffy, bake in the
  hot oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool on a rack.
  These are best eaten the day they're made, but they can be stored in
  plastic wrap.
  
  Two 8-by-10-inch flatbreads
  
  NOTE:  This olive-rich is rolled into aangle and thenslashed with a
  knife to form traditional patterns. The sunburst is popular, or a
  tree branch, a moon, or a sunflower. You won't need butter with this
  olive oil -drenched bread. It's a perfect accompaniment to salade
  Nicoise. Use dough setting.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        E  *****
  
  1 40 oz. can Clamato juice 1 lb. lean ground beef (cooked) 1 26 oz.
  can pureed tomatoes 1 medium onion (finely chopped) 1 14 oz. can
  consomme 4 stalks celery (chopped) 1 14 oz. can water 4 carrots
  (thinly sliced) 3 T. chicken soup base half a medium cabbage
  (shredded) 1 19 oz. can kidney beans 1 19 oz. can navy beans 1 t.
  oregano 1 t. basil 1/4 t. hot paprika 1/4 t. garlic powder 1 1/2 cups
  corkscrew pasta (cooked)
  
  1.  Bring Clamato juice, tomatoes, consomme and rest of ingredients
  from the first column to a boil. Simmer for half an hour. 2. Saute
  ground beef until browned thoroughly and set aside. 3. Saute
  vegetables (onion, celery, carrots and cabbage) until soft. Add to
  soup and simmer for another half an hour. 4.  Add kidney beans, navy
  beans, cooked pasta and meat. Continue to simmer for another 20
  minutes.
  
  This makes a great meal accompanied by bread or buns of your choice
  and a green salad.
  
  NOTE:  I omitted the beans (my family doesn't like them) and the
  cabbage (didn't have any in the fridge) and the soup was still an
  overwhelming success without them.

           -olives (nyons or
           Kalamata)
    1/4 c  Buckwheat flour
 
  Recipe by: BAKER'S DOZEN SHOW #BD1A29 You will need a large bread
  bowl, four 10- by 15- inch or larger baking sheets that will fit in
  pairs side-by-side in your oven, a sharp knife or razor blade, and a
  pastry brush. Place water in a large bowl, sprinkle on yeast, then
  stir in 2 1/2 cups of the all purpose flour. Stir 100 times in the
  same direction (one minute) to develop the gluten, then leave this
  sponge covered with plastic wrap for 30 minutes or up to two hours.
  Stir in olive oil, salt, olives, and buckwheat flour. Mix in
  remaining flour, a cup at a time, stirring always in the same
  direction, until dough becomes too stiff to stir. Turn dough out onto
  a well floured working surface. Using floured hands, knead gently
  until the dough has an even consistency (apart from the olives), then
  knead 5 minutes longer. Clean bread bowl, oil it lightly, place dough
  in the bowl, then cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for 2 to 3 hours.
  It will have almost doubled in  volume. Oil two 10 by 15 inch (or
  larger) baking sheets. Flatten dough down gently with your hands,
  then turn out onto floured working surface. Cut dough in half, return
  half to the bread bowl and cover. Divide remaining half in two. Knead
  each half into a ball and then flatten gently with the palm of your
  hand. Let stand five minutes to rest. Working with each piece in
  turn, flatten out with your palms into a rectangle or oval about 10
  inches long and 5 to 6 inches wide. It will be about 1/2 to 3/4 inch
  thick. Transfer each to a lightly oiled baking sheet at least 14
  inches long. Let loaves rise for 20 to 30 minutes, covered with a
  damp towel or plastic wrap. Preheat oven to 400 degrees and set rack
  at the center of the oven or just above. (If your baking sheets do
  not fit side-by-side on one rack, place two racks in oven, one just
  above the center and one just below. One bread can go on each rack;
  about halfway through baking (after 10 to  12 minutes), switch the
  two around.) Just before placing in the oven, use a sharp knife or
  razor blade to make cuts through the breads: Starting two inches from
  the top and about an inch from the side, cut across the bread to
  within an inch of the other side. Make two more cuts,  parallel to
  the first, at about 2 inch intervals (the cuts should go all the way
  through the dough). The dough will separate at each cut, so that the
  bread looks like a kind of fat-runged ladder; you can pull dough
  apart even more if you wish and if your baking sheets are long
  enough, by pulling gently on each end of the breads to make the slits
  gape more. Brush each loaf lightly with olive oil all over, place in
  the oven, and bake for 20 minutes. Breads will be golden when done.
  Once first two loaves are in the oven, oil two more baking sheets,
  then flatten remaining dough, divide into two, and repeat steps
  required to form loaves. Breads should almost have finished rising by
  the time the first batch comes out of the oven. Yield: 4 loaves

           Olive oil
           Lemon juice
      1 pn Majoram
      1 pn Oregano
 
   The small Gaeta olives, highly prized by Italians, are available in
  specialty food stores. Greek or Moroccan style black olives may be
  substituted, but the flavor of the Gaeta is matchless. Pit the olives
  and place in a shallow dish. Pour in enough oil to barely cover and
  add lemon juice to taste. Season with majoram and oregano and stir
  gently to combine the flavors. Cover and store in a cool place for
  several hours or overnight, stirring occasionally. Do not
  refrigerate!! Serves 6.

  You will have nearly a pint of delectable spread! It's best served on
  very thin toast or fresh, thinly sliced bread will do. A little

      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
    3/4 c  Warm water
    3/4 c  Warm beer

  1 1/2 ts Salt
  4 1/2 c  Flour( approx )
           Glaze:
      1    Egg
      1 tb Water
 
  I love the taste of fennel and extra virgin olive oil.
  
  Dissolve yeast in warm water and warm beer for 10 minutes or until
  very foamy. Add olive oil, salt and fennel seeds. Mix in 3 1/2 cups
  flour and knead until smooth and elastic adding more flour as needed
  to prevent stickiness.Place dough in oiled bowl, cover and let rise
  double. Punch down dough and divide into 12 balls and divide each
  ball into 4 pieces. Roll each piece into a long rope and place on
  greased baking sheets at least 1 inch apart. Brush with egg
  glaze.Bake immediately, 350 until golden about 30 minutes. Note: I
  also like to sprinkle on rosemary, anise or other seeds on the
  dough.Plus I make my bread sticks larger by dividing the 12 balls of
  dough in 2 or 3 pieces instead of 4. And I also like to brush on
  extra virgin olive oil instead of the egg wash over the breadsticks
  prior to baking them.then you have to turn them over during baking
  and brush more oil on them to brown the other side. I like the taste
  good olive oil gives!

 Categories: Stews
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
 
        1 lb stew meat
        4 cn French green beans
        3 lb potatoes
        1 ts salt
        1    beef bouillon cubes  --
  :          optional
  :          summer savory
  :          salt
  :          ground black pepper
  :          some vinegar to season  --
  :          optional
  
  Drain beans and use the liquid to boil the meat for about 2 hours at
  low heat.  Add about 1-2 teaspoon of salt (to taste!). You get a
  better stock when you put the meat in the cold liquid, heat to boil
  and then continue cooking slowly. Peel potatoes and boil until done.
  You needn't add salt because the beef broth will be salty enough.
  Reserve the water as well; you may need it to add to the stew when it
  turns out to thick. Take the meat out of the broth after two hours
  and cut it apart. You should add the lean parts to the stew. Now add
  the drained beans. Mash the potatoes and add them as well.  When you
  are lazy you might use instant potato puree, but that's not quite as
  good as the real thing. Heat the stew while stirring well.  If you
  consider it too thick add a bit of the reserved potato water. (BTW,
  the right consistency *is* rather thick!) Season to taste with
  savory, pepper and salt. Optionally you can add a cube of beef stock,
  although that isn't really necessary (my Mom does, my Granny
  doesn't...). I like to season the bean stew with vinegar, but this is
  also a matter of taste.  Just try and experiment a bit!

      Title: OMELET (#15)
 Categories: Egg, Woman's day
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 ea Eggs
    1/8 ts Salt
        x  Freshly ground black pepper
      1 tb Olive oil
 
  1.  Heat the broiler.  In a small bowl, using a fork, lightly beat the
  eggs, salt and pepper.
  
  2.  In an 8-inch nonstick, oven-proof skillet, heat the oil over a
  medium-high flame until hot (a drop of water will sizzle). Swirl the
  pan to coat the bottom and sides in hot oil.
  
  3.  Pour in the egg mixture.  Let it cook about 30 seconds. The edges
  will puff and bubble slightly and just begin to set. Hold the skillet
  handle with one hand, a wooden spoon with the other. Make "figure
  eights" with the spoon, starting at twelve o'clock, then three
  o'clock, etc., pushing the cooked edges toward the center and letting
  the uncooked egg run to the sides.  Keep the eggs moving until the
  bottom is set and the top is slightly moist.
  
  4. Place the skillet under the broiler 30 seconds to 1 minute, until
  the eggs are puffed and cooked to your liking. Slide half the omelet
  onto a plate and invert the pan to fold over for the remaining half.

      Title: OMELET ARNOLD BENNETT
 Categories: Breakfast
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      6 lg Eggs (the fresher
           -the better)
      6 oz Smoked haddock
           -(or other smoked large-
           -flaked white fish)
    2/3 c  Cream, heavy
           Butter
      2 oz Cheddar (sharp),
           -finely grated (the
           -light yellow New York/
           -Vermont style is best)
      1 pn Dill
      1 pn Salt and pepper
 
  Prepare the fish by poaching it lightly (5 minutes) and then breaking
  it up into nice large flakes.
  
  Whip the cream and fold in the grated cheese.  Add the fish and set
  aside. (The remaining steps are a basic omelet recipe and can be used
  with any filling.  Crack the eggs, beat them up with the dill, salt
  and pepper.)
  
  Meanwhile heat a frying pan.  Add a knob of butter and let it melt.
  When it has stopped frothing and is just beginning to go brown...
  
  Slop in half the egg mixture and immediately return to the heat and
  stir the eggs two or three times; then with a fork draw the edges
  into the middle and allow the un-solidified egg to run onto the
  exposed pan.
  
  While it is still a mixture of fluffy and runny, add the haddock and
  cream mixture.  Continue to cook until underside begins to turn
  golden brown. Fold over and serve on a hot plate with bread and
  butter immediately. (You can't leave it in the oven for ten minutes
  while you do another!)
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Omelet with cream and smoked fish filling -- In the vein of artery
  cloggers, this recipe must be one of the highest-cholesterol dishes
  I've come across in years. It may sound unconventional, but delicious
  it most certainly is. I came upon it in the Bistro under the Everyman
  Theatre in Liverpool, circa 1978. The following is my reconstruction
  of the dish I had there.
  
  *  My guess, although I haven't yet tried, is that the smoked haddock
  could be substituted with any large-flaked smoked white fish, like
  cod perhaps. The important point is that it should not have an
  overpowering flavour. I bought mine in a Scottish specialty shop in
  Kearny, NJ. Also, you should grate the cheese as finely as possible
  so that it blends smoothly with the cream.
  
  *  Now a diatribe on omelet pans.  I have always been most successful
  with a small thin tinned-copper omelet pan (which loses its heat and
  reheats very quickly), and a heavy cast iron skillet, which maintains
  an even hot temperature (and doesn't need to be reheated after adding
  the egg mixture). Aluminum and stainless steel pans tend to cool down
  too much and then take too long to reheat which results in a dry
  leathery omelet. (But, there again, you may like 'em like that.)
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  15 minutes.
  : Precision:  measuring spoils the fun.

 Categories: Russian, Ethnic, Eggs, Breakfast
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      6 oz Feta; Preferably Bulgarian
    1/2 c  Scallions (Green Onions);
           -Finely Chopped
  1 1/2 ts Sweet Hungarian Paprika;
           -Plus More For Garnish
      6 lg Eggs
    1/3 c  Milk
           Salt And Freshly Ground
           -Black Pepper
      2 tb Unsalted (Sweet) Butter
      2 tb Fresh Dill; For Garnish
 
  If the feta is too salty, soak in cold water for 30 minutes. Drain
  well and crumble into fine pieces. Combine, in a bowl, with the
  scallions and paprika, then set aside. In a large bowl, whisk the
  eggs, milk, salt and pepper, together, until frothy.  Melt the butter
  in a 10-inch omelet pan over medium heat. When the butter bubbles
  rapidly, add half of the egg mixture and stir until it just begins to
  set. Continue cooking until the eggs are almost completely cooked,
  running a thin spatula around the edges to prevent sticking, about 1
  1/2 minutes. Sprinkle half of the feta mixture on the omelet, then
  reduce the heat to very low, cover, and cook for 1 minute more. Slide
  the omelet onto a plate, folding it over if desired. Repeat with the
  remaining ingredients making 1 more omelet. Serve at once, sprinkled
  with more paprika and the fresh dill.

  *** OMELETS ***
  
  1. Mix eggs and water.
  
  2. In 7- to 10-inch omelet pan or skillet over medium-high heat, heat
  1 tablespoon butter until just hot enough to sizzle a drop of water.
  
  3. Pour in 1/2 cup egg mixture (mixture should set immediately at

    1/4 lb Mushrooms; thinly sliced
      1    Zucchini; medium/julienned
      1    Tomato; medium *
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Pepper
      2 tb Basil; chopped
      6 tb Parmesan cheese;grated fresh

MMMMM-------------------------OMELETTES------------------------------
     12    18 eggs; (2 to 3 per person)
           Pinch salt
           Pinch pepper
      1 tb Club soda
      6 tb Unsalted butter; (3/4 stick)
 
  * Peeled, seeded, and coarsely chopped 1. TO MAKE THE FILLING: In a
  medium skillet, heat the butter over medium heat until melted. Add
  the shallot and saute` until soft; about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms
  and saute` another 2 minutes.  Add the zucchini and continue to
  saute` for 2 minutes. 2.
   Add the tomato and cook over high heat for 2 minutes to evaporate any
  excess liquid from the tomato.  Add the salt, pepper, and basil and
  mix well.  Taste for seasoning. Cover to keep warm. 3. TO PREPARE EACH
  OMELETTE: Whisk 2 to 3 eggs with ta pinch of salt, a pinch of pepper,
  and 1/2 teaspoon club soda until smooth. 4. Melt 1 tablespoon butter
  in an 8-inch omelette pan or skillet over medium heat until it begins
  to sizzle. 5. Pour in the egg mixture and stir it in the center of
  the pan with the flat side of a fork. With the prongs of the fork,
  lift the edges on the omelette so any uncooked mixture runs to the
  edge of the pan. Vigorously slide the pan back and forth over the
  heat until the omelette begins to slip around freely. 6. When the
  omelette is lightly cooked but still creamy in the center, spoon
  about 2 tablespoons of the filling over the half of the omelette
  closer to the pan's handle. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the Parmesan
  cheese over the filling. 7. Quickly jerk the pan toward you with the
  handle so that the other half of the omelette flips over on top of
  the filling. Slide the folded omelette onto a serving dish. Serve
  immediately or keep warm in a low oven while preparing the remaining
  omelettes. ADVANCE PREPARATION: The filling may be prepared 1 day in
  advance without the basil and refrigerated.  Remove it from the
  refrigerator 1/2 hour before using, add the basil and gently reheat.

      3    Egg
    1/4 c  Sugar, brown
    1/2 c  Buttermilk
    1/2 c  ;Water or milk
    1/4 c  Coffee, brewed
  2 1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Salt

      1 ts Cloves, ground
      1 tb Cinnamon
      1 tb Ginger
      1 tb Nutmeg
      4 tb Butter; melted
 
  Cream together the eggs and the brown sugar, then add the buttermilk,
  water and coffee. In a separate container sift together the flour,
  salt, baking powder, baking soda, cloves, cinnamon, ginger, and
  nutmeg. Then combine the liquid and solid ingredients, adding the
  melted butter. Cook on a griddle as you would any other pancake. This
  recipe may require a fair amount of liquid adjustment. Make sure that
  the batter flows off of the spoon fairly evenly, or the pancakes will
  be too heavy, and will never cook all the way through without burning
  the edges! Serve with butter, maple syrup, honey, or molasses.

 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           - Judy Dunn   SSPJ19B
      1 cn Sweetened condensed milk
           -   (not evaporated)
 
  Remove label from can.  Place UNOPENED can in the bottom of a VERY
  DEEP pot, such as a deep dutch oven. Cover with water so that the
  water is 3 to 4-inches above the can. Bring the water to a boil and
  boil steadily for four (4) hours.
  
  YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT THE CAN IS ALWAYS TOTALLY COVERED WITH WATER.
  NEVER LET THE WATER LEVEL GET DOWN TO THE TOP OF THE CAN, BECAUSE
  THIS COULD CAUSE THE CAN TO EXPLODE.
  
  Don't worry, I've been doing this for years and years. At Easter time
  I boil 2 to 3 cans at once. After the four (4) hours is up, remove
  the can with tongs and place on a wire rack to cool. Be assured, the
  can will not explode.  Refrigerate.
  
  When can is cold, open and you will have soft caramel; even the color
  is caramel.  The only bad thing about boiling this one can is that
  you will be sorry you didn't boil two or three.

  :  An Experiment Illustrating the Logic Behind Matching Food and Wine
                                 by Josh Eisen
  
  The Recipes:
  
  White Bean Soup
  :1 1/2   c  dried white beans
  :           -soaked 8 hours
  :           -or overnight
  :           -drained and rinsed
  :4       c  water
  :4       md garlic clove(s), peeled
  :1       lg sprig rosemary
  :           salt and pepper to taste
  
  Put beans in large heavy pot and cover with 4 cups cold water. Add
  garlic and rosemary sprig. Gently simmer, covered, for an hour, or
  until beans are tender. Remove the rosemary sprig. If you like, pure
  1 or 2 cups of the beans and add it back to the soup. Add salt and
  pepper to taste. Yield: 6 cups
  
  Infused Olive Oil
  :1/4     c  olive oil
  :1       tb minced garlic
  :1       tb minced sage
  :1       tb minced rosemary
  :2       tb minced flat-leaf parsley
  :1/4     c  extra-virgin olive oil
  :           salt and pepper to taste
  
  In a small pot, heat the regular olive oil. Add the garlic and herbs.
  When the oil begins to sizzle, turn off the heat and let it sit; the
  herbs will have turned bright green. Allow th oil to cool a bit and
  add the extra-virgin olive oil. Stir and add salt and pepper to
  taste. The mixture should be heavily seasoned, as a small amount will
  flavor each bowl of soup. Yield: 2/3 cup
  
  Sofregit
  :1/3     c  extra-virgin olive oil
  :1       c  chopped onion
  :1       tb minced garlic
  :1       c  plum tomatoes, peeled
  :           -seeded and chopped
  :           -(fresh or canned)
  :1       tb minced flat-leaf parsley
  :1       tb minced sage
  :           salt and pepper to taste
  
  Heat a heavy saut pan and pour in the olive oil. When the oil is
  hot, add the onions and cook over low heat until they turn soft and
  golden brown, about 20 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until it
  begin to color slightly, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook
  slowly until they begin to blend with the onions, about 20 minutes.
  Add the parsley and sage and cook for another 10 minutes. Add salt
  and pepper to taste. Yield: 1 1/4 cups

  :  An Experiment Illustrating the Logic Behind Matching Food and Wine
                                 by Josh Eisen
  
  The Wines: 1. A dry, young Riesling that's fresh and delicate. If you
  can't find a Riesling, substitute a Pinot Blanc or Pinot Gris instead.
  
  2. A California Chardonnay or a Burgundy such as Puligny-Montrachet.
  
  3. A Cabernet/Merlot blend or an inexpensive, simple young red wine
  made without using new oak barrels.
  
  4. A good Cabernet Sauvignon where the oak is not a dominant flavor.
  
  The Wine Tasting:
  
  Start the tasting with a small bowl of the basic bean soup flavored
  with 1 tbs of the infused oil. The first wine you'll try is a dry
  Riesling This wine is aromatic, fruity and delicate. The soup is
  silky, full-bodied, and subtly flavored, and the olive oil gives it a
  complex and pungent aroma. The Riesling and soup enhance, but don't
  overpower each other.
  
  Try the next wine  a buttery chardonnay that has spent time in new
  oak. Compared to the Riesling, the Chardonnay has a heavy, rich,
  almost fat feeling in the mouth. Taste the Chardonnay with the soup
  and the soup's flavor seems to shrink in size. The soup's delicate
  aroma and silky texture are still there, but you have to look for
  them. The combination isn't unpleasant, but the wine is the dominant
  flavor. In conjunction with the Riesling, the soup was perfectly
  balanced. With the Chardonnay, the soup seems lackluster because the
  full body of the wine is out of balance with the delicacy of the soup.
  
  Follow the Chardonnay with the Cabernet/Merlot blend at room
  temperature. The wine and soup makes a passable combination, but the
  wine obscures the beans's silkiness and subtlety  qualities that
  had been exciting and delicious with the Riesling. The red wine
  obscures the soup, but not in the same way as the Chardonnay. The
  Cabernet/Merlot has too much fruit and not enough acid, and the soft
  fruitiness of the wine overpowers the simple soup.
  
  Now grate about a tablespoon of Parmesan cheese into each bowl of
  soup and the scenario changes completely. Suddenly, the Chardonnay
  comes into balance and is a stunning partner for the soup. This
  apparent change of heart happens because the cheese makes the soup
  taste richer and fuller, and the Parmesan's milk fat absorbs the
  wine's tannins. The sweet richness of the Parmesan is a good balance
  for the Chardonnay's rich, vanilla fruit. If you taste the Riesling
  with this version of the soup, you'll find that the wine somehow has
  become weak and flat.
  
  Now try this incarnation of the soup with the Cabernet/Merlot blend.
  You'll find the combination has no special dimension; in fact the
  soup tastes rather flat. Again, the problem is the wine's fruitiness,
  which still overpowers the dish. Even the strong flavor of the
  Parmesan doesn't give the soup enough strength to stand up to the
  wine.
  
  The final version of the soup incorporates a blend of slowly sauted
  tomatoes, onions, and herbs. When you add a couple of spoonfuls of
  this mixture to the soup, the dish changes altogether, Now there;s a
  lush, succulent feel to the soup, with a full range of flavors. The
  tomatoes make the soup both sweeter and more acidic, and these
  qualities give the Cabernet/Merlot a springboard. The same qualities
  that made this wine a poor choice in other versions of the soup now
  can be enhanced. In fact, at this point it's best to serve this wine
  just cooler than room temperature to bring out its fruit flavors and
  make the acidity more prominent. Together, the soup and wine taste
  balanced and alive, and they're a pleasure to eat together. The wine
  seems bright and lively without dominating your taste buds or the
  soup.
  
  If you were to try this version of the soup with a white wine, the
  combination would be underwhelming. White wines seem to wither and
  lose almost all their flavor in the face of acidic tomatoes.
  
  The final wine is another red  this time a Cabernet Sauvignon that's
  rich, concentrated, and aged in new oak. Taste this pairing and
  you'll find the wine dominates. The Cabernet is just too heavy,
  earthy, and intense for the soup, even with the tomato, onion, and
  herbal flavors of the sofregit. The Parmesan helps, but the
  combination is still merely fair, not dazzling. the lighter red wine
  more closely matches the soup's level of richness and intensity. Save
  the Cabernet for a lamb shank or veal chop which could follow the
  soup.

      3 tb Non-fat Dry Milk
      1    Onion, med., diced
      2 tb Butter
  1 1/2 c  Water, warm
 
  This recipe will make two loaves of bread in a standard loaf pan and
  calls for using a bread machine to do most of the labor.
  
  Place all ingredients into the bread machine in the order listed.
  Dried minced onions may be substituted for diced onion but water MUST
  be increased to approx. 2 1/2 cups. Place bread machine on setting
  for white bread and start.  When bread has completed it's second
  kneading, remove dough.  Cut dough in half and shape into two loaves
  and place in two greased and floured loaf pans. Place into a warm (90
  deg) oven on the top rack.  Place a pot of water that has been
  brought to a boil on the rack below the bread.  Cover bread with a
  moist tea towel.
  
  Allow bread to rise until doubled in size.  Remove towel and bake at
  350 deg. for approx. 45 mins. Remove from oven and remove bread from
  loaf pans to cool. This bread is particularly good when toasted.

 Categories: Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Rice/grains, Side dish, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Yellow onions; thinly sliced
           Olive oil
      6    Whole cloves
    1/2 ts Red pepper flakes
      1 c  Uncooked long-grain rice
      3 tb Ground cumin
      1 tb Coriander
      1 tb Ground ginger
      1    Cinnamon stick
           Salt; to taste
    1/4 c  Fresh lime juice
  2 1/2 c  Hot chicken stock
 
  Saute onions in a small amount of olive oil until they are lightly
  browned. Push the onions to one side of the pan and pour a little
  more olive oil into the middle of the pan. The oil must be hot enough
  for the cloves to sizzle when you add them.  Test with one clove
  before adding the others. Allow the cloves to sizzle for about 30
  seconds, but do not let them scorch.  Add the pepper flakes and rice.
  Saute until the rice is lightly colored.  Then add the cumin,
  coriander, ginger, cinnamon stick and salt to taste. Combine well and
  heat. Add the lime juice and chicken stock, stirring to blend, and
  cover the pan.
  
  Cook over the lowest possible heat for 15 minutes, without removing
  the lid.  Remove the cinnamon stick and cloves and serve the rice
  immediately.
  
  Meras notes that this spicy dish goes well with any grilled fish.

 Categories: Veggies, Onion, Posted-mm
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 lg Onions, unpeeled
      1 lb Minced lamb
      2 lg Tomatoes,peeled and chopped
    1/3 c  Long-grain rice
      1    Lemon,finely grated & juiced
      1 sm Onion, finely chopped
      1 tb Sugar
      1 ts Tumeric
    1/2 ts Basil
    1/2 ts Oregano
           Salt to taste
           -freshly grd. black pepper
      3 tb Olive oil, for cooking
 
  Souce: From the Garden to the Table
  
  Put the =unpeeled= onions in a large saucepan. Pour in plenty of
  boiling water. Boil for about 20 minutes, or until the onions are
  tender. Remove the onions from the pan, drain them and allow them to
  cool slightly.
  
  In a bowl, thoroughly mix the next 9 ingredients. Season to taste
  with salt and pepper. Set aside.
  
  With a sharp knife, slit each onion down one side to the center.
  Separate the layers, which will slip of quite easily. Discard the
  outer papery skins and the cores of the onions.
  
  Take a small handful of the filling and work into a sausage shape;
  squeeze out some, but not all, of the liquid. Reserve the excess
  liquid for use later.
  
  Lay the stuffin in one of the onion layers and fold it tightly around
  the mixture. Fill the remaining layers in this way. Do not overfill
  the layers as the rice must have room to expand.
  
  Heat the oil in a pan large enough to take the stuffed onions in one
  layer. Add the stuffed onions, packing them in close together. Pour
  in any liquid remaining in the bowl. Reduce the heat, cover the pan
  and simmer gently for about 1 hour.
  
  Halfway through the cooking time turn the stuffed onions over.
  
  Carefully remove the dolma from the pan with a spatula and serve
  immediately or set aside to cool.

      Yield: 1 Foccacia
 
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
    1/2 tb Yeast
      1 c  Lukewarm water
    1/2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Rosemary, ground
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Wheat germ
      3 c  Flour

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
      3 md Onions, diced
  1 1/2 tb Olive oil
           Salt & pepper
           Olive oil, for brushing
 
  In a mixing bowl, combine the yeast, water, sugar, salt, oil &
  rosemary. Let stand until the yeast starts to froth. Mix in the wheat
  germ & 1 c flour.  Beat well & let sit for 5 minutes. Knead in the
  remaining flour & knead until the dough is soft & pliable. Lightly
  oil a clean bowl & cover with a towel.  Let rise until doubled in
  bulk.
  
  Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet & saute the onions, reduce
  heat to low & cook until the onions begin to caramelize. Remove from
  heat & set aside. Preheat oven to 350F.
  
  Roll out the dough to fit into a cookie sheet or on a pizza stone.
  Lightly sprinkle the cookie sheet with cornmeal & place the dough on
  the sheet. Stretch into the corners & build up the edges slightly.
  Let rest for 10 minutes.
  
  Brush the dough with olive oil & spread the onions over the top.
  Generously salt & grind fresh black pepper over the top. Bake for 25
  minutes or until the crusts are done. Cut up & serve immediately or
  let cool. This is equally good cold & served at room temperature.
  
  NOTE: I thought this recipe was from "Friendly Foods" by Ron
  Pickarski, & it is not.  It is also not in Carol Field's "Italy in
  Small Bites", so if someone has the source for this recipe I'll
  gladly give it the credit. In the meantime, this is what I do for
  onion foccacia & I guess it comes from my head each time.

  roll, so they adhere to the pancake. COOKING: Heat skillet on medium
  heat, add 1 tsp. oil. Brown slowly on both sides until golden. Repeat
  with rest of the pancakes, adding a little oil as needed. Serve while
  hot. DO AHEAD NOTES: Cook ahead and refrigerate or freeze. If frozen,
  thaw out first. Then reheat single layer for 5 minutes in preheated
  400 degrees oven or in skillet until thoroughly heated. Great hors
  d'oeuvres! COMMENTS: Do not brown bacon until crisp. Cook until firm
  only. (If too crisp, the flavor is cooked out.) Finely mince bacon.
  Pancakes are good either as luncheon side dishes (serving them whole)
  or as hors d'oeuvres (cutting each pancake into quarters). The
  traditional version does not include bacon, but Ms. Yee happens to
  like the bacon taste. Source: "Dim Sum" by Rhoda Fong Yee. Formatted

  (Note from Larry: I have 2 other .. very similar .. recipes. Both have
  almost identical ingredients. The difference lies in the directions
  and Rose's comments. I felt it was necessary to add the reference to
  Tony Roma's in the title for this reason. 4/14/95) Slice onions
  crosswise and separate into rings. Combine milk, eggs and salt to
  taste in mixing bowl. Soak onion rings in mixture 30 minutes. Place
  pancake mix in shallow bowl. Heat oil for frying in skillet to 375
  degrees. Remove onion rings from milk mixture, dip in pancake mix and
  place in hot oil. Fry rings until golden brown. Drain fried onion
  rings on paper towels. Pack fried onion rings solidly, but loosely,
  without pressing, into 8x4-inch loaf pan. Bake at 400 degrees 10 to
  15 minutes. Turn onto serving plate. Garnish with parsley. Each
  serving contains about: 377 calories; 1,069 mg sodium, 54 mg

  recipe for the onion loaf served at Tony Roma's restaurants? It's
  outstanding. ~Betty "DEAR BETTY: Thank you. We love the rings too.
  The Tony Roma restaurant chain would not share its trade secret, but
  a close facsimile recipe was developed by home economist, Donna
  Deane, director of The Times Test Kitchen. Tony Roma's staff did,
  however, offer a tip: Pack the onions loosely (not firmly) in the
  loaf pan so they do not become soggy."

    3/4 c  Flour
    1/2    Bottle of beer
      1 ts Ground black pepper
      1 ts Salt

  PEEL THE ONIONS and cut them crosswise into rounds about 3/4-inch
  thickness, separate rings and set aside. Place the flour in a mixing
  bowl and break in the eggs. Mix, slowly adding the beer until batter
  is smooth. Add salt and pepper. The batter should be the thickness of
  a thick pancake batter. Thin with up to 1/4 cup of soda water. Heat a
  3-inch thickness of frying oil in a deep pot over medium heat on the
  stove. When the oil is hot enough for frying (350F), a droplet of
  water will dance across the surface of the oil and evaporate. Dip the
  onion rings a few at a time in the batter. Remove from batter and let
  the excess drip off. Carefully place rings in the hot oil and fry
  until golden. Remove the rings as they are done. Keep warm in a 200F
  oven until all the rings are fried.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      3 lg Onions, chopped
      4    Garlic cloves minced
      3 tb Butter
      2 tb Flour
      1 ts Dried thyme leaves
      7 c  Rich beef stock
      1 tb Tomato paste
           Salt and pepper to taste
      2 oz Gorgonzola
      4 sl French bread, toasted
 
  Onion soup is a classic example of caramelization as a flavour
  enhancer. This soup gets an added flavor boost from the garnish--a
  slice of gorgonzola topped bread.
  
  Cook onions and garlic in a large, heavy, covered soup pot over
  moderate heat until they release their moisture, about 10 minutes.
  Add butter and cook uncovered, until onions are a rich golden brown,
  about 15 minutes. Add flour and thyme and cook 5 minutes longer,
  stirring constantly. Add stock and tomato paste. Simmer for 15
  minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
  
  Place a 1/2-ounce slice of Gorgonzola on each piece of toast and run
  under the broiler for 1 minute, or until the cheese is bubbly. Ladle

  The day before you wish to make this bread, place the onions in a
  small bowl with the starter.  Cover the bowl and leave at room
  temperature for 12 hours.  Fit the kneading blade firmly on the shaft
  in the bread pan. Carefully measure the dry ingredients and transfer
  to the pan. Add the onions and starter, water, yogurt, oil and yeast.
  Place the bread pan inside the machine and close the lid. Program the
  breadmaker for the whole wheat mode.  The unit will begin its
  operation. At the end of the baking cycle, remove the bread promptly
  from the machine, taking care, as the oven surfaces will be very hot.
  Invert the bread pan onto a wire rack and shake several times to
  dislodge the bread. Allow to cool completely on the rack before
  slicing or wrapping for store. Source: The Bread Machine Gourmet by

      Title: ONION TART
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
    200 g  Plain flour
    130 g  Unsalted butter, softened
      3 tb Water
      1    Egg
      1 ds Salt

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
    400 g  Onions
     30 g  Bacon, cut into thin strips
     50 g  Unsalted butter
  3 1/2 dl Cream
  3 1/2 dl Milk
      4    Eggs
      1 ds Gratted nutmeg
      1 tb Chopped parsley
           Salt and pepper
 
  Pastry
  
  Make the flour into a 'well' on the pastry board, beat the egg and
  add it, with the butter, salt and a little of the water, to the
  centre of the well, then work the ingredients into the flour with
  your fingertips, incorporating more water little by little; whether
  you have to use all the water or not depends on the quality of the
  flour. Press all the dough together into a ball then, finally, work
  it thoroughly with the heel of your hand, gathering it up with pastry
  scraper as you do so until it is soft and pliable. Leave it in the
  refrigerator to firm up again before you roll it out.
  
  Filling
  
  Peel the onions. Cut them into fine rings and weigh out 300 g.
  
  Cook the bacon strips (which need to be VERY finely cut) in the
  butter. Let them take on a golden colour, then add the sliced onions
  and leave them to cook gently until they are tender.
  
  In a bowl beat together the cream, milk and eggs, adding salt, pepper
  and nutmeg to taste.
  
  When the onions are cooked, add them to the mixture in the bowl and
  add the chopped parsley.
  
  Preparation
  
  Roll out the dough 2mm thick and use it to line a buttered tart tin
  26 cm in diameter and at least 3cm deep. Cut a disc of aluminium foil
  of the same diameter as the tin and place it on the pastry. Weight it
  down with a handful of beans or crusts.
  
  Pre-heat the oven to 150 oC (300 oF) and cook the pastry 'blind' for
  half an hour. Watch the coulouring of the edge and as soon as it
  starts to turn golden remove the aluminium foil and beans or crusts.
  Cook the pastry shell until the base is baked but not coloured.
  
  Fill the shell with the onion mixture. Put the tart back into the
  oven. Check that the temperature is still 150 oC and keep the oven at
  or just below this temperature for about 1 hour. Towards the end you
  could reduce the heat a little, as the tart needs TO COOK VERY
  SLOWLY. The tart is ready if, when you shake it, the filling appears
  to be quite firm with no hint of a whole in the centre.
  
  Serve warm, in small slices !

      Title: ONION TWIST BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4    To 4-1/2 cups all-purpose
           -flour
      2 pk Dry yeast
    1/3 c  Non-fat dry milk
  1 1/2 c  Hot tap water (120 - 130
           -degrees)
      2 tb Shortening, room temperature
      2 tb Sugar
      1 pk Onion soup mix (1-3/8
           -ounces)
      2 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
      1    Egg, room temperature
 
  You will need two medium baking pans (greased or Teflon) or one baking
  sheet (greased or Teflon).  If glass pans are used, reduce oven heat
  by 25 degrees.
  
  In a large mixer bowl combine 2 cups of flour and the yeast. In a
  saucepan measure milk, water, shortening, sugar, soup mix, and
  cheese. Stir over a low heat until warm (120 degrees). Pour this into
  the dry mixture, add the egg and beat at a low speed in the electric
  mixer for 30 seconds. Scrape down bowl. Turn mixer to high for three
  minutes. Stop the mixer, and with a wooden spoon gradually stir in
  more flour to form a soft dough that will clean the sides of the bowl.
  
  Kneading:
  
  Sprinkle the work surface with flour and turn the dough onto it, Knead
  until the dough is smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with the
  inverted bowl and let it rest on the counter top for twenty minutes.
  
  Shaping:
  
  To make two twist loaves, divide the dough into 4 parts. Shape each
  piece into a smooth 12 inch roll. Twist 2 pieces together and press
  ends to seal. Tuck under the sealed ends, place loaf in prepared pan.
  Loaves can also be baked on a baking sheet.  Place them 2 inches
  apart.
  
  Rising:
  
  Cover with wax paper or foil until doubled in size (about 45 minutes).
  Dough will rise to about 1/2 inch above the edge of the pan.
  
  Baking:
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Bake in oven until the crusts have
  browned. The loaves will draw away from the sides of the pan. When
  tapping, the bottom crust yields a hard, hollow sound, the bread is
  done. Remove bread from the oven.  Turn out on metal cooling racks.
  Brush with melted butter for a nice soft finish.

 Categories: Bakery, Breads
      Yield: 4 Breads
 
    1/4 c  Olive oil, plus...
      2 ts Olive oil, room temp.
  1 1/2 c  Finely chopped onion
      1 c  Warm water
      1 pk Quick-rising yeast
      1 ts Sugar
  1 1/4 ts Salt
      4 ts Fennel seeds
      3 c  (about) all-purpose flour
 
  Saute onions in olive oil over medium-low heat. When onions are
  tender, transfer to bowl of electric mixer fitted with dough hook.
  
  Add 1 cup of warm water to onion.  Blend in yeast, sugar and salt.
  Crush 2 teaspoons fennel seeds using a mortar and pestle; add to
  onion mixture. Gradually mix in flour until you have a dough of
  medium-soft consistency. Turn out dough onto floured surface and
  knead until smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Cover dough and let
  rest for 20 minutes.
  
  Grease a heavy baking sheet.  Divide dough into 4 equal pieces and
  roll each piece into a ball.  Flatten balls of dough to 3/4"
  thickness and place on greased baking sheet. Rub surface of each
  bread with remaining butter or oil and lightly sprinkle with
  remaining whole fennel seeds, pressing slightly to make seeds stick.
  Cover and let rise for 30 minutes.
  
  Preheat oven to 425F.  Bake breads until golden brown, about 25
  minutes.

 Categories: Breakfast, Cheese/eggs, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ts Margarine
      1 sm Onion, thinly sliced
      2 ts Sugar
      1 c  Mushrooms, sliced
      1 tb Balsamic vinegar
      3    Egg whites
      1 tb Milk, nonfat
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Black pepper, ground
      1 tb Parsley, fresh - chopped
 
  Prep time: 15 mins. Cook time: 15 mins.
  
  In large nonstick fry pan over medium heat, melt the margarine. Saute
  onion with sugar until tender and golden brown, about 4 mins. Add the
  mushrooms and vinegar and cook till mushrooms are tender, 3 mins.
  Transfer the onion and mushroom mix to a small bowl. In a large bowl,
  combine the egg whites, milk, salt and pepper. Beat egg-white mixture
  until stiff peaks form. Wipe out nonstick fry pan and coat with
  nonstick cooking spray. Place over medium heat. Add the egg-white mix
  and gently level using back of spoon. Spread onion-mushroom mix over
  half of the eggs. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low and cook till eggs

  Serving tips: If preparing several omelettes, keep the first ones
  warm, covered with foil, in a 250 F (120 C) oven until all are ready
  to be served.
  
  Additional notes: All the fat and cholesterol in eggs reside in the
  yolks, while the egg whites are rich in protein and albumin. For
  healthier cooking of any recipe with eggs, substitute 2 egg whites
  for each whole egg.

  Peel the onions and boil in water for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove and

  Set aside the shells and pulp.
  
  Heat the olive oil and saute the bell pepper with the hot pepper
  until they are soft.  Add the garlic and cook for only a minute or
  two before adding the tomatoes. Continue cooking until most of the
  juice evaporates. Stir in the shrimp, coriander, and salt and pepper
  and remove from the heat. Stuff the shrimp mixture into the onion
  shells and place them in a small ovenproof casserole.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Heat 2 tablespoons butter and saute 1
  cup of the reserved onion pulp until the onions are translucent.
  Sprinkle with the flour and stir until the mixture browns uniformly.
  Immediately add the wine, the reserved water from the onions, and the
  tomato sauce. Simmer for about 5 minutes or until the sauce thickens.
  
  Pour the sauce over the stuffed onions.  Sprinkle with the bread
  crumbs and dot with the remaining tablespoon of butter broken into
  bits. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 15 to 20 minutes or until nicely
  browned. Source: Narsai M. David.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 pk Tempeh
    1/2    Onions; thinly sliced
      1 ts Butter
      1    Garlic cloves, crushed
      1    Chili peppers
    1/2 ts Sauce, soy
      1 ts Sugar, brown
 
  Dice tempeh and deep fry until crunchy.  Fry onion in butter until
  limp; add garlic and chili pepper and saute briefly. Add fried tempeh
  and stir around. Add sweet soy sauce and brown sugar. Keep stirring
  the mixture. Tempeh is fermented soy beans and paste sold in
  "bricks." The idea is to coat the tempeh with the sugary, spicy,
  oniony, flavor...so you won't taste the tempeh. (G)

      Title: OPEN SANDWICHES (SMORREBROD)
 Categories: Danish, Sandwiches, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  There is no doubt that Denmark's open sandwiches (Smorrebrod) are the
  most famous feature of the Danish kitchen. Strangely enough they are
  not found elsewhere, even in neighboring countries.  Danish
  sandwiches have hundreds of variations and new ones are constantly
  being composed.
  
  From the simple, "flat", four sandwiches that office workers take
  with them to work and eat at their desks accompanied by a bottle of
  milk, they range to the gloriously colored "high" compositions, so
  generous that three are enough for a meal, eaten at restaurants. With
  the latter, piled high with good things, we drink Danish beer, which
  is exported to nearly every country in the world.  With Smorrebrod
  too we drink Danish snaps, a clear, innocent-looking fluid to be
  treated with respect.
  
  Though few really enjoy the taste, it has the power to make you feel
  happier, to loosen your tongue, to banish your inhibitions and to make
  social occasions an unqualified success.
  
  Recipes for some typical Danish sandwiches follow.  In Denmark we
  usually make them with dark rye bread.  The bread should be made with
  whole grain and should be as firm as possible, so that the slices can
  be quite thin. Also white bread can be used, but it should be with a
  heavy texture and it may be toasted.  Fish is usually the starter and
  from there one goes to the meat and salad.  Almost inevitably Danes
  wind up the smorrebrod meal with a piece of buttered white bread on
  which a good cheese has been placed.
  
  FINE PICKLED HERRINGS:  (Fine marinade Sild)
  
  Clean, skin and bone six large salt herrings and soak them overnight
  in milk.  Make a dressing of 1/4 cup tarragon vinegar and 1/4 cup
  ordinary vinegar sweetened with 1/2 cup sugar. Add 1 chopped onion, 1
  chopped cooked carrot, two chopped pickled gherkins and 1 cup tomato
  ketchup and season with 10 whole cloves and 10 whole peppercorns. Let
  the dressing stand overnight.
  
  Rinse the herrings, cut in slices and let them stand in the dressing
  for 24 hours before serving.
  
  Drain the herring pieces well before putting them on buttered bread,
  otherwise it might become soggy. Decorate with some of the onion from
  the dressing.
  
  EGGS AND HERRINGS:  (Aeg og Sild)
  
  Spread slices of hard boiled egg on buttered bread and place one or
  more boned herrings lengthwise on the egg. Decorate with cress.
  
  CHOPPED EGG AND HERRING:  (Hakket Aeg og Sild)
  
  Skin and bone two smoked herrings carefully.  Boil two eggs until
  hard and put in a glass or large cup together with the herrings. Run
  a sharp knife quickly from side to side until the ingredients are
  finely chopped and thoroughly mixed.  Press the mixture on to
  buttered bread and top with cress.  Makes 4 sandwiches.
  
  SMOKED HERRINGS AND EGG YOLKS:  (Roget Sild med Aeggeblomme)
  
  Butter the bread and top with long, cleaned fillets of smoked
  herrings.
  
  Make a cavity in the center of the fillets with your fingers, circle
  it with a ring of raw onion, and put a raw egg yolk in it. Pile raw
  onions or chopped radishes at both ends of the yolk.

  1 1/2 tb Cornstarch
 
  TO ASSEMBLE: 30 dumpling or gyoza skins Sesame oil for coating
  steamer 1/2 cup minced scallion greens
  
  Lightly chop the ground pork until fluffy.  Place in a mixing bowl
  and add the remaining filling ingredients. Stir vigorously in one
  direction with your hand or a wooden spoon to blend the ingredients
  evenly.
  
  Place a heaping tablespoon of the filling in the middle of a dumpling
  skin and gather the edges of the skin around the filling. Holding the
  dumpling between your index finger and thumb, squeeze it in the
  center to form a "waist".  Push the filling up from the bottom to
  create a flat surface. Smooth the top surface with the bottom of a
  spoon dipped in water.
  
  Line steamer trays with damp cheesecloth or parchment paper that has
  been brushed with sesame oil (if steamer trays are not available,
  lightly brush several aluminum pie plates with sesame oil). Arrange
  the shaped dumplings about 1/4-inch apart in the steamers or on the
  plates.
  
  Fill a wok or a spaghetti pot water level with the bottom edge of the
  steamer tray and heat until boiling. Stack the steamer trays one on
  top of the other, cover and place over the boiling water.
  Alternatively, you may fit the pie plates in the spaghetti pot and
  cover with the lid. Steam the dumplings for about 15 minutes over
  high heat, reversing the stacked trays after 8 minutes.  Remove the
  cooked dumplings and continue steaming the dumplings as necessary.
  Sprinkle the finished dumplings with the minced scallion greens and
  serve with dipping sauces.

  NOTES:
  
  This week I thought I'd try a dessert recipe since Brandon's birthday
  is Wednesday and his request was peach pie. This peach pie is one
  easy dessert too. You can make your own pie crust, or buy a frozen
  one at the store to save time (although I recommend making one). I
  bought some canned peaches in light syrup and plan to add about 2
  tablespoons sugar or less. Judge for yourself as to how sweet you
  want it to be. I also will add a little cinnamon to the crumb
  mixture. Yum! Peach pie is one of my favorites. Wish me luck and
  Brandon a "Happy Birthday"!

  These little open-faced steamed dumplings, a popular item in dim sum
  teahouses, are a special treat, for you seldom see a vegetarian
  version. With their flowerlike appearance and savory filling, they
  are an attractive luncheon dish.  You can use the ready-made
  wrappers, sold in refrigerated or frozen sections of some markets
  ("shu mai skins"). "Suey gow skins" or "gyoza wrappers" are too thick
  and will dry out during steaming. Wonton wrappers can be substituted,
  but trim off the pointed corners. Better yet, prepare your own
  wrappers according to the directions below.
  
  DIRECTIONS: =========== To prepare wrappers, combine flour and hot
  water. Knead a couple of minutes into a smooth dough; cover and let
  rest at least 1 hour. Place on a lightly floured board, and knead for
  2 minutes or so. With palms of your hands, roll it into a long,
  cylindrical shape, 7-1/2 inches inches long, 1 inch in diameter. Cut
  crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces; you will have 15. If your climate is
  dry, keep the dough covered. Shape these, cut-side up, into a round
  shape. Flatten them with the palm or heel of your hand on a
  flour-dusted board. With a pastry roller, small rolling pin, piece of
  dowel, or even an empty jar -- all of these should be wielded under
  the palm of your hand -- roll each into a round wrapper, 3-1/2 inches
  in diameter, thicker in the center, thinner toward the edge. This is
  easily done by rolling the pastry roller from the edge of the piece
  of dough to the center, and back again, turning the dough
  counterclockwise a little with your left hand after each roll.
  Continue all the way around several times, also turning the dough
  over once or twice, until you have a thin, 3-1/2 inch wrapper.
  
  Prepare Filling A or B by combining the ingredients. Place
  approximately 1 tablespoon filling on the center of each wrapper.
  Holding the wrapper on your left fingers, encircle it from below with
  your right thumb and index finger, gathering the wrapper up around
  the filling. Squeeze gently around the middle to make a kind of neck;
  some of the filling should emerge at the top.  The bundle should hold
  together securely or it will collapse during steaming. Pat the bottom
  with your left hand to make a flat base. If the skin is not too
  floppy, you can also turn the edge slightly outward (like an open
  flower), pinching it if necessary to make it secure.
  
  Place a layer of damp cloth in a bamboo steaming basket or on a flat,
  perforated race (you can use a heatproof plate if you have neither of
  these, but circulation of steam is somewhat impaired this way).
  Arrange the shao mai on it.  With the rack well above the boiling
  water in a steamer, steam for 10 minutes (if frozen, do not defrost
  first). They will stick to the cloth, but if you wash and reuse the
  same cloth each time, they will not stick as much.
  
  Serve while still hot, before the skin hardens -- as is, or with small
  dipping saucers of soy sauce and mushroom liquid (from the black
  mushrooms), mixed in equal proportions. Add a few drops of sesame oil.
  
  Advance preparation: These can be assembled in advance, frozen, and
  steamed just prior to serving.

      Title: ORANGE & HONEY BREAD PUDDING
 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
        1    stick (4 ounces) unsalted
  :          butter
       30 sl French bread, between 1/8
  :          and 1/4-inch thick,
    1 1/2    inches in diameter, -- about
        3    to 4 ounces
        2 c  milk
        1 c  heavy cream
      2/3 c  honey, -- preferably orange
  :          blossom
        3    California navel oranges
        5 lg eggs
  
  Note: The oranges can be peeled and sliced after using their zest to
  flavor the pudding. Sprinkle them with a little sugar and orange
  liqueur and serve them along with the pudding.
  
  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Melt the butter and cool it
  slightly. Dip one side of each slice of bread into the butter and
  arrange the bread, buttered side up and slightly overlapping in a
  shallow 1 1/2 quart baking dish.
  
  Combine the milk, cream and honey in a saucepan. Strip the zest from
  the oranges with a vegetable peeler and add to the pan. Be careful
  not to include any of the white pith under the zest or the pith might
  contribute a bitter flavor. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium
  heat, remove from heat and allow to stand about 5 minutes for the
  zests to steep and flavor the mixture.
  
  Whisk the eggs until liquid in a large mixing bowl, then whisk in the
  hot milk and cream mixture. Do not overbeat or the custard will have
  a great deal of foam on the surface. Strain the custard back into the
  pan and skim the foam from the surface with a large spoon. Pour the
  custard over the bread in the dish, pouring so that the bread is
  evenly soaked and rises to the surface.
  
  Place the baking dish in another larger pan and pour warm water into
  the pan to come halfway up the side of the baking dish. Bake the
  bread pudding for about 45 minutes, until the custard is set and the
  bread is an even golden color.

      Title: ORANGE ANGEL FOOD CAKE WITH CARAMELIZED PEARS
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Egg whites, about 12 large
  1 1/4 ts Cream of tartar
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      1 c  Cake flour, sifted
           Pinch of salt
      1 ts Vanilla extract
  2 1/2 tb Orange rind; chopped
           - (colored part only)
      1 ts Freshly squeezed lemon juice

MMMMM---------------------------PEARS--------------------------------
      8    Ripe pears, peeled, cored,
           - sliced 1/3-inch thick
    1/3 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 tb Fresh lemon juice
      2 tb Brandy
           Pinch of salt
 
  This gussied-up version of an old favorite comes from "Stars Desserts"
  (Harper Collins) by Emily Luchetti.
  
  1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. For cake, put the egg whites in
  large bowl of an electric mixer. Beat on medium speed until frothy.
  Add the cream of tartar. Increase to high speed and continue to mix,
  slowly pouring in the sugar. Continue whipping until the whites have
  increased to several times their original size and they form soft,
  droopy white peaks.
  
  2. Remove the bowl from the machine and fold in the flour, salt,
  vanilla extract, orange rind and lemon juice.
  
  3. Gently scoop the batter into an ungreased 10-inch angel food cake
  pan. Bake until top is light brown and a skewer inserted in the
  middle comes out clean, about
       30    minutes.
  
  4. When the cake has finished baking, invert the pan and allow it to
  cool. If your pan does not have legs to rest on when inverted, invert
  the inner tube of the pan onto a bottle. When the cake is completely
  cool, run a knife around the inside edge of the pan and remove from
  the pan.
  
  5. For pears, combine the pears and the remaining ingredients in a
  12-inch skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until the sugar starts to
  caramelize lightly and the pears are soft but still retain their
  shape, 10 to 15 minutes. As they begin to color, stir the pears
  gently to prevent them from burning.
  
  6. Serve the cake with warm or room-temperature caramelized pears and
  raspberry sauce, if desired.

      Title: ORANGE BEEF WITH SUN-DRIED TOMATOES
 Categories: Ethnic, Chinese, Stir-fry, Posted-mm, Suzy
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 lb Flank steak
      2 tb Brandy
      2 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 tb Corn oil
      8 c  Water

      1    Jalapeno pepper,preferably
           -red, chopped, with seeds
    1/4 c  Chicken or beef stock
           -coarse or kosher salt
           -freshly ground pepper
 
  Source: Susanna Foo Chinese Cuisine
  
  To marinate the beef: Place the flank steak on a flat surface and cut
  in half lengthwise. Cut into 1/8" wide slices on the diagonal,
  cutting against the grain.
  
  Mix the brandy and soy sauce in a bowl. Add the steak; mix. Add the
  cornstarch and mix well to coat. Add the oil, mixing well to separate
  the pieces of meat. Let sit at room temperature for 20 minutes or up
  to one hour.
  
  Meanwhile, cook the orange zest; Bring the water and the sugar to a
  boil over high heat in a saucepan. Add the orange zest and boil for 5
  minutes. Drain, rinse under cold water, squeeze dry and set aside.
  
  Soak the sun-dried tomatoes in warm water for about 10 minutes, or
  until softened. Cut them into julienne pieces.
  
  In a large skillet or a wok, heat the oil until it is very hot, almost
  smoking (350 degrees). Add the steak, using chopsticks or a large
  fork to separate the pieces as they cook. Once the steak has turned
  golden, about 2 minutes, remove it from the skillet with a slotted
  spoon and drain well; set aside.
  
  Remove all but 2 Tbl. oil from the skillet. Add the orange zest,
  sundried tomatoes, scallions, garlic, ginger root and jalapeno. Cook
  over high heat for 1-2 minutes, stirring, until the garlic is golden.
  
  Return the steak to the skillet, add the stock, stir well and cook,
  stirring for 3 minutes until all of the liquid is evaporated. Season
  to taste with salt and pepper.
  
  Transfer to a platter and serve.
  
  Serves 2 as a main dish with rice or 4 in sandwiches with good bread.
  
  Cook's tip: When stir-frying meat, marinate the slices in a mixture
  of soy sauce, brandy and cornstarch, then mix in a little oil. Adding
  some oil at this point and in this order is very important, for when
  the pieces of meat are later cooked in hot oil, they will separate
  easily.
  
  The meat should be seared over very high heat to seal in the juices.
  
  This quick-cooking technique keeps the outside well brown and crisp,
  while the inside stays moist.

      Title: ORANGE CHEESECAKE WITH STRAWBERRIES
 Categories: None, Cheesecakes
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
      1 c  Finely crushed vanilla
           -wafers
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 tb Egg white
           Vegetable oil cooking spray

MMMMM-------------------------CHEESECAKE------------------------------
     16 oz Low-fat cottage cheese
      8 oz Light cream cheese
           -(Neufchatel), at room
           -temperature
    1/3 c  Sugar
      1 tb All-purpose flour
      2 tb Orange juice
  1 1/2 ts Grated orange rind (colored
           -part only)
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 lg Navel orange, sectioned,
           -membranes removed
      1 pt Strawberries, sliced thinly
 
  This delicious cheesecake is adapted from "The Lighter Touch
  Cookbook," by Marie Simmons. Using egg whites in the crust instead of
  butter and combining low-fat cottage cheese with cream cheese keeps
  the calories to 137 per serving and the fat to 5 grams, excellent
  numbers for a dessert that is still rich and satisfying.
  
  1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Combine the vanilla wafers and
  cinnamon in a bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg white until
  foamy and blend it into the crumbs with a fork.
  
  2. Spray a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray. Press the crumbs
  in an even layer in the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake 10 minutes.
  Cool. Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees.
  
  3. Combine the cottage cheese, cream cheese, sugar, flour, orange
  juice, orange rind and vanilla extract in the bowl of a food
  processor until very smooth. Spoon into the prepared crust and smooth
  the top with a rubber spatula.
  
  4. Bake until set in the center, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool in the pan.
  Refrigerate until cold. Loosen the sides of the cake with a small
  spatula and remove the pan rim.
  
  5. Combine the orange sections and strawberries. Cut the cheesecake
  into thin wedges and spoon some fruit on each serving. Posted By

      Title: ORANGE CHIP COOKIES
 Categories: Bakery, Cookies, Low-fat
      Yield: 40 Cookies
 
      3 c  White flour
    1/2 c  Wheatgerm
      2 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Allspice
    2/3 c  Unsweetened chocolate chips
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
    1/2 c  White sugar
    3/4 c  Orange juice
 
  In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, salt & allspice.
  Stir in the chocolate chips.  Add the rest of the ingredients in
  order, beating well after each addition.
  
  Lightly oil non-stick cookie sheets.  Drop the batter by the
  teaspoonful onto the cookie sheets.  Bake 12 to 15 minutes until
  lightly browned. Cool on wire racks.
  
  NOTE: I've had wild variations with this recipe.  One batch cooked in
  7 minutes, one batch did not cook until 20 minutes. It seems to have
  settled down between 12 & 15 minutes as I changed some of the
  ingredient amounts. I've also had anything from 33 to
       45    cookies in a batch.

  powder, and salt in a large bowl. Add the cranberries (with the juice
  and rind) to the flour mixture.  Add the liquid mixture to the dry
  mixture. The batter will be runnier than most muffin batters -- but
  that's the way it should be. Fill 12 greased muffin cups (or use foil
  baking cups to line the muffin cups) with the batter and bake for
       25    minutes.
  
  These muffins are very moist and tasty.  The rather strange
  measurements of flour and sugar are the result of my reducing the end
  result from 4 dozen muffins to
        1    dozen.

  This custard pie is similar in style to key lime pie, but flavored
  with orange and topped with meringue rather than whipped cream ++ to
  use up the egg whites that otherwise go to waste.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350F.  To make the filling, stir together the
  milk, egg yolks, orange juice and orange liqueur. Pour into the
  prepared pie shell and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until just set.
  Remove from the oven and turn the heat to 450F.
  
  To make the meringue, combine the egg whites and sugar in a metal
  bowl. Set in a pan of simmering water (or place the pan directly over
  lowest heat if desired) and stir for a minute or two ++ your clean
  index finger is t;he best tool for stirring ++until the sugar has
  dissolved and the mixture is warm.  Remove from heat, add the cream
  of tartar and salt, and beat until the meringue stand in soft peaks.
  Spread over the pie and return to the oven for about 5 minutes, until
  golden. Cool to room temperature.

        3 TB water
  :          Juice of half a lemon
  :          Custard:

      1/2 c  sugar
        2 TB heavy cream
        1 ts vanilla
  
  Preheat the oven to 350. Begin by making the caramel. Combine the
  sugar, water and lemon juice in a heavy bottomed saucepan and cook
  until the mixture is thick, bubbly and amber colored. This mixture
  will be very hot, don't touch. Pour the caramel into an 8-inch cake
  pan, swirling it around so it covers the entire bottom of the pan.
  Set aside. Prepare the custard. Whisk the orange juice, eggs, egg
  yolks, sugar, cream, and vanilla together until smooth. Pour the
  custard mixture over the caramel. Set inside of a larger pan, and
  pour enough hot water in the larger pan to reach halfway up the sides
  of the custard pan. Bake until the custard is firm, about 30 minutes.
  Allow to cool to room temperature, and refrigerate until needed.
  Using a knife, loosen the edges of the custard from the sides of the
  pan. Invert a plate on top of the pan and quickly flip it over. The
  caramel from the bottom of the pan forms its own sauce for this dish.

      Title: ORANGE FLUFF CAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Sifted cake flour
      1 ts Grated orange zest
      1 c  Granulated sugar
    1/3 c  Strained fresh orange juice
      2 ts Baking powder
      6 lg Eggs, separated
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      5 tb Unsalted butter, melted
    1/2 ts Cream of tartar
           Glaze:
      1 c  Sifted confectioner's sugar
      2 tb Fresh orange juice
      1 ts Grated orange zest
 
  1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350
  degrees F. Have ready an ungreased 10-inch tube pan with a removable
  bottom. (Do not use a tube pan with a nonstick surface.)
  
  2. Sift the flour, half cup sugar, the baking powder, and salt into a
  medium-sized bowl. Form a well in the center and add the melted
  butter, orange zest, orange juice, and the yolks, and vanilla. With
  an electric mixer, beat until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.
  
  3. In a large bowl combine the egg whites and cream of tartar; beat
  with an electric mixer until soft peaks begin to form. Gradually beat
  in the remaining half cup sugar and continue to beat until stiff
  glossy peaks form. Stir a large spoonful of the whites into the
  batter to lighten. With a spatula, quickly fold in the remaining egg
  whites, half at a time, to make a fluffy batter that is even in
  color. Turn into the ungreased tube pan and bake one hour to one hour
  and 15 minutes, until the top springs back when lightly touched and a
  toothpick inserted emerges without crumbs clinging to it. Immediately
  invert and let the cake hang upside down until completely cool. (If
  the pan does not have tabs on it's rim, place tube over the neck of a
  bottle). Turn right side up and run a sharp knife around the edge to
  separate the cake from the pan. Remove sides. Run a knife around the
  center tube and under the cake; remove the pan bottom. Turn the cake
  right side up on a serving plate.
  
  4. Prepare glaze: In a small bowl combine the confectioner's sugar,
  orange zest, and orange juice to make a glaze. Spread over the top of
  the cake, letting some drip down the sides. Let stand at room
  temperature until glaze has set, about one hour.

      Title: ORANGE GUMDROPS
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 72 Servings
 
      1 c  Sugar
      1 c  Light corn syrup
    3/4 c  Water
      1 pk (1 3/4-ounce) powdered fruit
           -pectin
    1/2 ts Baking soda
  1 1/2 ts Orange extract
      1 ts Finely shredded orange peel
      4    Drops yellow food coloring
      1    Drop red food coloring
           Sugar
 
  Line a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan with foil, extending foil over edges of
  the pan.
  
  Butter the foil; set pan aside.
  
  Butter the sides of a heavy 1 1/2-quart saucepan.  In the saucepan
  combine the 1 cup sugar and the corn syrup. Cook over medium-high
  heat to boiling, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to dissolve
  sugar. This should take about 10 minutes.  Avoid splashing mixture on
  sides of pan. Carefully clip candy thermometer to side of pan.
  
  Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, till the
  thermometer registers 280 deg.F., soft-crack stage. Mixture should
  boil at a moderate, steady rate over the entire surface. Reaching
  soft-crack stage should take about 10 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, in a heavy 2-quart saucepan combine water, pectin, and
  baking soda. (Mixture will be foamy.) Cook over high heat to boiling,
  stirring constantly. This should take about 2 minutes. Remove
  saucepan from heat; set saucepan aside.
  
  When sugar mixture has reached soft-crack stage, remove the saucepan
  from heat; remove candy thermometer from saucepan. Return pectin
  mixture to high heat; cook till mixture just begins to simmer.
  
  _Gradually_ pour the hot sugar mixture in a thin stream (slightly
  less than 1/8-inch diameter) into the boiling pectin mixture,
  stirring constantly. This should take 1 to 2 minutes. Cook, stirring
  constantly, 1 minute more.
  
  Remove saucepan from heat.  Stir in orange extract, orange peel, and
  yellow and red food colorings.  Pour candy mixture into prepared pan.
  Let stand about 2 hours or till firm.
  
  When firm, use foil to lift candy out of pan.  Use a buttered knive
  to cut candy into about 3/4-inch squares. Roll squares in additional
  sugar. Store loosely covered.  Makes about 72 pieces.
  
  Cinnamon Gumdrops:  Prepare Orange Gumdrops as directed above, except
  substitute 3 drops oil of cinnamon and 7 drops red food coloring for
  the orange extract, orange peel, and yellow and red food colorings.
  
  Mint Gumdrops:  Prepare Orange Gumdrops as directed above, except
  substitute 3/4 teaspoon mint extract and 7 drops green food coloring
  for the orange extract, orange peel, and yellow and red food
  colorings.
  
  Lemon Gumdrops:  Prepare Orange Gumdrops as directed above, except
  substitute 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon extract, 1 teaspoon finely shredded
  lemon peel, and 7 drops yellow food coloring for the orange extract,
  orange peel, and yellow and red food colorings.

 Categories: Chile-heads, Salsa
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Habanero (to have medium
           Heat - add more
           If you like)
      2    Carrots
      3    Cloves garlic
    1/4 c  Water
      2 tb Chopped white onion
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Freshly squeezed lemon
           Juice
    1/4 c  Ginger pickle juice (or
           Substitute fresh -- 1 tsp.
           Sugar
           Ginger and a little water)
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2    Orange zestted
 
  I steamed the carrots and garlic with water until soft in the
  microwave. (You could use them raw for a sharper flavour and
  crunchier texture.) Put everything in the blender and pureed till
  smooth. Adjust flavours. (More lemon or salt might be good.) It was
  delicious as a thick condiment with my pasta with pesto, and also a
  great topping on a cold potato salad today. The sauce thickened
  overnight in the refrigerator, and I suspect it will keep for about a
  week. It's such a beautiful, bright orange colour! Katrine Kirk

      Title: ORANGE JULIUS 2
 Categories: Beverages
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      3 c  Orange juice; fresh is best!
 
    1/2 can Cream of coconut, sweetened
    1/4 pkg Vanilla pudding mix, instant
      1/2    pkg Dream Whip
  :          Ice cubes
  
  Combine ingredients except ice in blender and whip. If desired, add
  ice slowly until crushed.
  
  Sylvia's notes: Of all the Orange Julius recipes I've collected, none
  of them had the coconut I _knew_ was included. This really tastes
  like the Orange Julius I've paid way too much to buy. And it is sized
  to make the most possible in my blender without overflowing.

      Title: ORANGE JULIUS TYPE DRINK
 Categories: Beverages, Non-alcohol, Alcohol
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 c  Milk
  1 1/2 c  Orange Juice
      1 c  Cold Water
      1 c  Finely Crushed Ice
 
    Add all these ingredients in a 48oz blender, adjust Quantities for
  individual taste.  Blend on Highest Speed for around 5 to 10 seconds
  and pour.  To achieve a closer taste to the real thing use Carbonated
  Water but regular tap water will due.  You can also substitute
  Strawberries or pineapple for the Orange Juice or mix flavors. I have
  adjusted the recipe by taking 1/4th the ingredients and use one of
  the New hand held blenders to mix a single serving in a cup.
  
   Be sure when you do this you don't fill the cup too full or you'll
  have a mess.

      Title: ORANGE LETTUCE & WALNUT SALAD (SHLADA BELLECH
 Categories: Fruits, Grains, Salads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Head romaine lettuce
      3    Navel or temple oranges
      2 tb Fresh lemon juice
      2 tb Sugar
      1 pn Salt
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
      1 tb Orange flower water
    3/4 c  Walnuts; chopped
 
  Wash lettuce and section into leaves, discarding the tough outer ones.
  Drain; wrap in paper towels to dry. Store in refrigerator until
  needed.
  
  Peel oranges and remove all outside membranes, using a small serrated
  knife and employing a seesaw motion. Section the oranges by cutting
  away all the membranes from the orange flesh. As you work, lift out
  each section and place in a small mixing bowl.  Squeeze the juice
  from the remainder of the orange over the sections to keep them
  moist. Cover; keep chilled.
  
  Make a dressing by mixing the lemon juice, sugar, salt, cinnamon,
  orange flower water and 2 tb. of the orange juice. Blend well, then
  taste. The dressing should be sweet.
  
  Just before serving, shred the lettuce and arrange in a glass serving
  dish. Pour the dressing over it; toss. Make a design around the edges
  with overlapping sections of orange, then sprinkle the salad with the
  chopped walnuts and dust with more cinnamon.  Serve immediately.
  
  Variation:  Prepare as above, using 3/4 cup chopped dates and almonds
  in place of the chopped walnuts.

  granulated sugar
  
  Measure oranges and lemons together. Add 5 times as much cold water.
  During next 24 hours, boil hard for an hour. This will reduce the
  quantity one-half. Measure into 4-cup units. <Cooking in this
  quantity will produce better flavor.> If oranges are overly sweet,
  add 1 tbsp lemon juice for every cup of fruit. Bring to boiling
  point. Boil 8 minutes. Add 3/4 cup sugar for each cup of fruit.
  
  Boil first unit rapidly until it jells -- not more than 10 min. If a
  longer time seems to be necessary, boil the next unit for a longer
  time before the sugar is added. Pour into sterilized glasses and

      Title: ORANGE MERINGUE PIE
 Categories: Pies, Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------------PIE PASTRY------------------------------
      2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    2/3 c  Vegetable shortening
      2 tb Ice water (or more)
      2 c  Fresh orange juice
     12 tb Unsalted butter; sliced
  1 1/2 tb Grated orange zest
    1/2 c  Fresh lemonjuice
      2 ts Grenadine syrup

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      6 tb Cornstarch
      3 tb All-purpose flour
      1 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Boiling water
      5    Egg yolks; lightly beaten

MMMMM--------------------------MERINGUE-------------------------------
      5    Egg whites; at room temp.
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Cream of tartar
    1/2 c  Sugar; plus...
      2 tb Sugar
 
  Combine the flour, salt and shortening in a large mixing bowl, and
  cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse meal. With a
  fork, stir in only enough ice water to enable the dough to be
  gathered into a ball. Flatten the ball into a disk, wrap in waxed
  paper and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. On a lightly floured
  surface, roll out the pastry into an 11-inch round. Without
  stretching, fit the pastry into a 9-inch pan. Trim, leaving a
  1/2-inch overhang all around; discard the pastry scraps or reserve
  for another purpose.  Tuck under the excess pastry and crimp to make
  a decorative edge. Refrigerate for 30 minutes before baking. Preheat
  the oven to 425 F. Line the pastry with aluminum foil and weigh down
  with aluminum pie weights or dried beans to prevent the pastry from
  bubbling. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until crisp and golden. Cool
  on a rack. PREPARE THE FILLING:  In a large mixing bowl, combine the
  cornstarch, flour, sugar and salt.  Stirring constantly, pour in the
  boiling water nad blend until smooth. Add the egg yolks and orange
  juice and beat until smooth.  Transfer the filling to the top of a
  double boiler over, but not touching, boiling water and cook,
  stirring frequently, for 15 to 20 minutes. When the mixture is very
  thick, remove it from the heat. Add the butter, orange zest, lemon
  juice and grenadine; stir until the butter melts.  Cover with a round
  of waxed paper place directly on the surface and let the filling cool
  to room temperature.  Pour into the pre-baked pie shell, cover with
  waxed paper and chill for at least 5 hours or overnight. PREPARE THE
  MERINGUE: Preheat the oven to 350 F. Place the egg whites in a bowl,
  add the salt and beat until the whites are foamy. Add the cream of
  tartar and beat until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar and
  continue beating until the whites are stiff and very glossy. Do no
  overbeat or the meringue will be dry. Pile the meringue on the
  filling, mounding it in the center and spreading it out to the edge

      Title: ORANGE POPPYSEED DRESSING
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    2/3 c  Safflower or corn oil
    1/4 c  Lime juice
      2 tb Orange juice
      2 tb Orange rind; grated
      2 tb Honey
      2 tb Onion; minced
      1 tb Poppy seeds
      1 x  Salt & pepper to taste
 
  ** I used peanut oil and minced green onions when I made this. I
  served it on a salad of Boston lettuce with melon and chopped
  prosciutto. Slightly toast the poppy seeds (method below). Place all
  ingredients in a screw-top jar. Shake vigorously.  Chill until
  serving. This dressing complements any green salad, but the addition
  of some small chunks of cantelope, honeydew, or star fruit to your
  greens will enhance the orange-honey flavor of the dressing.  Or try
  it over slices of cold roast pork with nectarine wedges on
  watercress. Poppy Seeds:  Did you know that it takes almost a million
  seeds to make a pound?  These tiny bluish-black gems come from the
  opium poppy plant. But even if you eat a million, you won't
  experience any narcotic effect. Connoisseurs say those imported from
  Holland taste best. For even better flavor, seeds should be slightly
  toasted in a 350 degree oven for about 5 minutes.

  NOTES:
  
  *  A luscious orange-flavored pound cake -- Absolutely the best cake
  I have ever eaten! I got the recipe from the mother of a friend. I
  think Don's mom got the recipe off the back of a sugar box.
  
  *  If you try to make a pound cake with margarine or shortening you
  will end up with a tasteless mess. Butter is the major taste in a
  pound cake; even if it weren't, butter and margarine have different
  properties in baking, and this recipe is adjusted for butter.
  
  *  Don't make this cake if you don't have an electric mixer or very
  strong wrists.  I figure I spend nearly half an hour beating butter
  and such when I make this cake. Also, this cake is easier to handle
  if you have a tube pan that comes apart into two pieces.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30-40 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

 Categories: Digest, Nov.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      5 lb Sweet potatoes (about
           7 large)
    1/4 c  Brown sugar
    1/4 c  Oj
    1/4 c  Sweet orange marmalade
      1 tb Grated peeled ginger
    1/4 c  Prepared butter buds
           (optional -- I just used
           Water because some
           People in philly fatfree are
           Vegan; 1/4C is half a
           Pk )
      1    Box Obies oatmeal cookie
           Mix
 
  Bake the sweet potatoes until very soft. Allow to cool.
  
  In a bowl, mash together the first 6 ingredients (peel the potatoes
  first!). Pour into a 13x9x2 pan (I used an extra large pie pan).
  
  In a separate bowl, mix up the obies mix, so that it is not overly
  wet (the
  
  directions say to add 1/4 cup of water, and then add water by the
  tablespoon. I think I probably added 2 or 3 tablespoons.) Cover and
  chill for 2 hours.
  
  Crumble oatmeal topping over potato mixture, until it's evenly
  distributed. Bake at 350F until golden brown, about 10-15 minutes.
  (Make sure the oatmeal has cooked through!) If the oatmeal starts to
  turn white, take it out -- it's drying out.
  
  Good alternative to marshmallow topped sweet potatoes. Has the Jackie
  Manni seal of approval. =-)

      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      4    Egg yolks
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Flour
      1 tb Cornstarch
  2 1/2 c  Milk
      1 tb Packed finely grated
           Orange peel
      5    Large navel oranges
     54    Almond meringues
      1 c  Chopped walnuts
      1    Sponge cake or
           18 3-inch ladyfingers
    1/2 c  Seedless raspberry jam
      6 tb Medium-dry sherry
      2 c  Heavy cream, chilled
      1 tb Confectioner's sugar
      2 ts Vanilla extract
 
  In a medium heatproof bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the granulated
  sugar, flour and cornstarch until thoroughly blended. In a heavy
  medium saucepan, combine the milk and the orage zest and bring to a
  boil over moderate heat. Gradually whisk the boiling milk into the
  egg mixture. Clean the saucepan and strain the custard into it. Bring
  to a boil over moderate heat, whisking constantly, about 3 minutes.
  Reduce the heat to moderately low and cook, whisking constantly, for
  2 minutes longer. Pour the custard into a clean bowl and whisk until
  slightly cooled, about 1 minute. Let cool to room temp, whisking
  occasionally to prevent a skin forming. Cover and refrigerate for at
  least 2 hours. (The custard can be made up to 2 days in advance)
  Using a small sharp knife, peel the oranges, making sure to remove
  all of the bitter white pith. Working over a bowl, cut between the
  membranes to release the segments. You should have 3 cups of orange
  sections and juice. (The oranges can be prepared up to 2 days ahead;
  cover and refrigerate) Set aside 12 of the Almond Meringues and 1/4
  cup of the walnuts for garnish. Cut the cake into 18 3-2-inch pieces.
  Spread 1 side of each piece of sponge cake or each ladyfinger with
  the raspberry jam. In a deep 4-quart nonreactive serving bowl,
  preferably glass, arrange 1/3 of the sponge cake pieces or
  ladyfingers in a single layer, jam side up. Sprinkle 2 tb of the
  sherry over the cake. Scatter 1/3 of the orange section, with their
  juice, on top. Scatter 1/3 of the remaining meringues between the
  sponge cake pieces and sprinkle with 1/3 of the remaining walnuts.
  Spread 1/3 of the custard evenly on top. Repeat the layering of
  sponge cake, sherry, orange sections, meringues, walnuts and custard
  2 more times. Cover the trifle and refrigerate overnight. In a large
  bowl, whip the cream with the confectioner's sugar and vanilla until
  stiff. Spread or pipe the whipped cream over the top of the trifle.
  Refrigerate until serving time. (The trifle can be prepared to this
  point up to 4 hours ahead.) Just before serving, arrange the reserved
  meringues over the top of the trifle and sprinkle the remaining 1/4 c
  walnuts on top. Source: Food and Wine November 1992

 Categories: Main dish, Mexican, Spicy
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2    Pork chops 3/4" thick Smoked
           -if possible
    1/2 c  Orange Juice
      2    Chipotles in Adobo (canned)
           Or 2 dried reconstituted in
           Warm water for 20 min. Use
           -1 to reduce spicyness
      1 pn Salt
    1/4 c  Triple Sec, Cointreau,Grand
           -Marnier or other Orange
           -Liqueur
 
  * Chipotle chiles are a type of smoked Jalapeno typical of Mexico.
  They can be found widely as far as I understand. If you cannot find
  them canned in adobo , you can use dry ones and reconstitute them,
  though I make the dish with the canned ones.
  
  ** This dish requires a Flambe, so if you cannot Flambe (or are
  afraid to do so), you can always take the orange liqueur and add it
  to the marinade before you reduce it though the result is not the
  same.
  
  Directions:
  
  In a blender or food processor, combine Chipotles, salt and Orange
  Juice. Place in a shallow dish together with pork chops and marinade
  in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Take chops out of marinade.
  Reserve Marinade. Put marinade in in a small saucepan and reduce
  until 1/3 of the liquid remains. In a frying pan, place pork chops
  and cook in medium-high heat until cooked through. Take chops out of
  the pan, and drain any excess oil. Put pan on high heat and cook
  until no liquid remains and a glaze is formed on pan. Take pan away
  from the heat and put the pork chops back on the pan. Add the 1/4 cup
  Orange Liqueur and Flambe. When the flames die out take chops out of
  the pan and keep warm. Put the pan back on the stove and add the
  reduced marinade. Heat until starting to boil. Put the chops in a
  serving platter and pour some sauce on top. Enjoy. It should be sweet
  and spicy.

  Separate batter into 2 equal parts. Blend chocolate into one part.
  Blend liqueur and peel into remaining part. Pour chocolate batter
  over crust. Bake 30 minutes.
  
  Reduce oven temperatue to 325 F.
  
  Spoon remaining batter over chocolate layer. Continue baking another

      Title: ORANGE-HONEY MARMALADE
 Categories: Jam/jelly
      Yield: 1 1/2 cups
 
      2 lb Oranges; weigh w/skins on
    3/4 c  Honey
      1    Navel orange; rind only
 
  The white rind (between the outer skin of an orange and the tough
  shell around the pulp) contains bioflavonoids which good
  nutritionists say have an important place in nutrition. Ordinarily
  you should eat as much of this rind as you can leave on the orange.
  Unfortunately, it cooks up very tough in a marmalade, and, if you
  leave patches of it on the chunks of orange, you get tough white
  patches of it in the marmalade. So, peel off as much as you can.
  
  We like to use a combination of oranges for this: temples, navels,
  juice oranges--whatever is available. But we prefer navels for their
  peel which has a good texture and flavor.
  
  Peel the oranges, pit them, and cut up into small chunks. Put them
  all in a large pot. Add the honey. Shave the navel orange peel into
  fine slices and add. Stir and cook, uncovered, over a simmering-low
  flame for about 40 minutes or until thick.
  
  Yield: about 1 1/2 cups.

  water until it just looses its firmness and drain. Meanwhile saute,
  in a large skillet, the carrots and onions in broth until onions are
  just translucent and the carrots are crisp tender. Add the squash and
  orange juice mixture to the carrots and onions. Continue cooking
  until the squash has the desired texture and the moisture has boiled
  off.
  
  This recipe is my adaption of one from Friendly Foods by Ron
  Picarski. The combination of orange juice and white miso gives the
  dish a very pleasant taste.

  4. Pour remaining egg mixture over bread; cover dish and refrigerate
  several hours or overnight.
  5. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon sesame seeds over soaked bread slices.
  6. In large skillet over low heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter; cook 4
  bread slices, seeded side down, until lightly browned, about 7 to 9
  minutes.
  7. Sprinkle with half the remaining sesame seeds; turn and continue

      Title: ORANGE-WINE WAFERS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 50 Servings
 
  2 1/2 tb Orange zest (2 large
           Oranges)
      2 c  Pastry or all-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Baking powder
      2 tb (1/4 stick) butter or
           Margarine, softened
    1/2 c  White wine
 
  "A perfectly simple cracker delicately flavored with orange zest and
  wine, this is an ideal match for a glass of white wine. We prefer to
  use Chardonnay, but any dry white wine that you may have already
  opened will work well. 350~F. 15 to 20 minutes Preheat the oven to
  350~F.
  
  To prepare the zest, lightly grate the outer peel of the oranges
  against the fine grate of a cheese grater. Use only the colored part
  of the rind; the underlying white portion is bitter.
  
  In a large bowl or in the food processor, combine the flour, orange
  zest, salt, and baking powder. Cut in the butter until the mixture
  resembles coarse meal. While stirring, add the wine in a slow stream
  and blend to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.
  
  On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll out to a rectangle
  approximately 1/4 inch thick and position so the long edge runs
  horizontally in front of you. Fold the left third of the dough over
  the center third. Likewise, fold the right third over the center. The
  dough is now in 3 layers with the seam running vertically. Give the
  dough a quarter turn so the seam now runs horizontally. Roll out the
  dough again to a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Fold and turn the
  dough again as in the first step. You are now ready for the final
  rolling.
  
  Roll the dough out somewhat thinner this time, about 1/8 inch thick.
  With a sharp knife, cut in to 2-inch squares or shapes as desired and
  place each one on an ungreased baking sheet.
  
  Prick each cracker all the way through 2 or 3 times with the tines of
  a fork. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until lightly browned. Remove to a
  rack to cool. Yield: 40-50.

    1/2 c  Light Brown Sugar
      2 tb Orange Peel Grated
    1/4 ts Salt
      1    Egg
      1 oz Semisweet Chocolate,very

  1 3/4 c  Flour
           Glaze:
  1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
      2 tb Orange Juice
      4 tb Lemon Juice
 
  Cream butter, sugar, orange peel, and salt in the mixer at high speed
  for 1 to 2 minutes, untill light and fluffy. Add the egg and beat 1
  minute more at medium speed. Add the chocolate and the flour and beat
  at low speed just enough to combine. Divide the dough, flatten each
  half into a 6-inch circle, wrap in plastic wrap and chill for at
  least 2 hours or, better yet, overnight. When ready to proceed,
  preheat oven to 375 F. Roll out each circle of dough, one at a time,
  between sheets of lightly flowered waxed paper until scant 1/4 inch
  thick, sprinkle with flour once during rolling. Carefully pel off the
  top piece of paper and, using 2 1/2 inch round cutters, cut the
  dough-still on the bottom sheet of wax paper- into rounds but do not
  lift from paper. Slide the paper of dough on a cookiesheet and set in
  the freezer for 5 minutes. Than use small spatula to remove the
  cookies and space 1 inch apart on a lightly greased baking sheet.
  Bake the cookies in the middle of the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until
  lightly browned on the edges. Transfer at once to wire racks. For the
  glaze: whisk the powdered sugar with the juices until smooth. Using
  pasrty brush, brush the glaze on the still warm cookies. As soon as
  glaze is hard you can store them with waxpaper between the layers in
  airtight containers.

  moist. Cover; keep chilled. Make a dressing by mixing the lemon
  juice, sugar, salt, cinnamon, orange flower water, and 2 tb. of the
  orange juice. Blend well, then taste. The dressing should be sweet.
  Just before serving, shred the lettuce and arrange in a glass serving

 Categories: Pasta, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/4 lb Pancetta or bacon, cut into
           -1/4-inch cubes
      1 tb Butter
      1 ts Minced garlic
      1 lb Shallots (12 to 15 large),
           -peeled and thickly sliced
    1/2 ts Sugar
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
  1 1/2 c  Chicken or veal stock,
           -preferably homemade
    1/4 c  Heavy cream (optional)
      1 c  Tightly packed fresh herb
           -leaves, including rosemary,
           -sage, thyme, marjoram, flat
           -leaf parsley, and basil
      1 lb Orecchiette
    1/2 ts Olive oil
  1 1/2 c  Grated imported Parmesan,
           -preferably Parmigiano
           -Reggiano
 
  1. Place pancetta in a large saute pan and cook over medium-low heat,
  stirring occasionally, until crisp, about 15 minutes. Using a slotted
  spoon, remove from pan and drain on paper towels. Set aside. Pour off
  all but 1 T of the fat.
  
  2. Add butter to the fat in the pan. Add garlic, shallots, and sugar
  and season lightly with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to lowest
  setting and cook, covered, until shallots are soft and transparent,
  about 15 minutes. Remove lid, raise heat to medium high, and cook,
  stirring constantly, until pan has deep golden-brown coating, about
  10 minutes. Do not allow to burn.
  
  3. Add the stock and simmer until reduced by one-third, stirring to
  loosen brown bits from bottom of pan, about 7 minutes. The sauce can
  be prepared up to this point several hours ahead and kept, covered,
  in the refrigerator.
  
  4. Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta. (Reheat the
  shallot mixture if it was prepared in advance.) If using, add cream
  to shallots and simmer for 2 minutes over high heat, until sauce
  thickens slightly. Keep warm. Coarsely chop all but a small handful
  of herbs.
  
  5. Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain and return to
  pot. Add chopped herbs to sauce and cook for another minute. Season
  to taste with salt and pepper. Add pasta to sauce and toss together
  over low heat for 1 minute. (As pasta and sauce heat, fry remaining
  herbs in 1/2 t olive oil until crisp, for garnish.) Stir in pancetta
  and 1/2 C of the grated cheese. Divide the pasta among 4 bowls.
  Garnish with fried herbs. Serve remaining cheese on the side.

  Bring about 3 quarts of water to a boil in a pot.
  
  Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large saucepan.  When it is hot, add the
  onions and 1 cup water; mix well and bring the mixture to a boil. Then
  reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for 10 minutes, until the water
  evaporates.  Remove the lid and cook the onions for 5 minutes over
  high heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned.
  
  Add the pasta to the boiling water and return the water to a boil,
  stirring the pasta occasionally at first so it doesn't stick together
  or to the pot. Cook the pasta for 12 minutes, or until firm to the
  bite (al dente).
  
  Remove 3/4 cup of the pasta cooking liquid from the pot and reserve
  it.
  
  Add the anchovies, garlic and oregano to the onions in the saucepan,
  mix well and stir in the salt, pepper and the reserved pasta cooking
  liquid.

  Thoroughly mix all filling ingredients together and set aside.
  
  Dissolve yeast in warm water. Add salt and butter, blend until well
  mixed. Knead until dough is elastic and smooth, about 10 minutes.
  Place in greased bowl, cover and let rise until doubled, about 1
  hour. Divide dough into 2 pieces and roll into oblong pieces 15x12
  inches. Spread each with 1/2 of the filling. Roll up sealing as you
  roll. Place on greased baking sheets dusted with cornmeal, seam side
  down. Let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Make 3 or 4 diagonal cuts
  on each loaf. Bake in 450 oven for 25 minutes. Remove, brush with egg
  white and water mix, bake 5 minutes more.
  
  For best results, keep oven very hot and place a pan with 1 inch of
  water on the bottom rack. This steam will create the classic crunchy
  crust of good French bread.

  "The Oreo is as basic to the fabric of American culture as Coca-Cola,
  the Marlboro Man, a Chevy Impala, or speeding tickets. They're the
  standard bill o' fare at Boy Scout Eagle ceremonies, Red Cross blood
  drives and virtually every hurricane relief center.
  
  "But while there is great disucssion amoung Real Men over the virtues
  of double-stuffed Oreos versus the purist's standard cookie, there's
  one thing everyone agrees on: The only way to eat this fabled
  delicacy is to split it in half and eat the center first.
  
  "(The psychological reasons for this are many and varied; some liken
  it to the opening of the Wild West, others, to the aphrodisiac
  quality of oysters.  For more information on the subject, we refer
  you to the exhaustive research paper, 'The Psycholinguistic and
  Socioeconomic Implications of Oreo Opening on Twentieth-Century
  Mandkind' by Drs. Asher and Schofield, Our Mother of Perpetual Motion
  University, 1957. This document may still be classified.  If so, we
  recommend suing under the Freedom of Information Act.
  
  "With this energy-saving recipe, you'll be able to eliminate the
  tedious, labor-intensive process of breaking open the Oreos and just
  get down to eating the centers.
  
  "If all of this seems confusing, just remember one thing: The French
  people open bottles of wine; Real Men open Oreos."

   Meanwhile beat Crisco till fluffy, adding vanilla and sugar a little
  at a time.  Beat in Gelatin mixture when it is completely cooled, but
  not yet "set" or firm. This is used to give the filling stability -
  as well as protein!  When cooled, shape filling into 1 inch balls.
  Place between the two bottom sides of the cooled cookies, pressing
  gently till filling has spread to edge of cookies and rounded-out
  like the originals. This is suppose to be a great imitation version
  of the original Nabisco Oreos.

 Categories: Ew text imp
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Cookie  wafers:
      1    Box duncan hines dark fudge
    1/3 c  Water
      2 tb Shortening
           -----CREME FILLING------
  3 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
    1/2 tb Granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 c  Shortening(no substitution)
      3 tb Hot water
 
  Preheat oven to 325F.  Blend all ingredients; then knead with your
  hands until it is pliable like dough. Form dough into 3/4 inch balls
  and press flat, 1/2 inch apart on greased cookie sheets. Bottom of a
  glass works nice for this.  Bake 4 to 6 minutes or until cookies are
  crunchy. I should think you could refrigerate the dough in cylinder
  shaped rolls for a couple of hours and slice 1/8 inch thick, as well.
  Let cookies cool on sheets. Combine filling ingredients and mix well.
  Form into balls about 1/2 to 3/4 inch in diameter (this is a
  preference thing in the U.S. and part of the great Oreo cookie
  debate!), again using your hands. Sandwich one filling in the center
  of two cookies and carefully press down until the filling spreads
  almost to the edge. Makes 2 dozen cookies (4 dozen wafers)

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
      1 sm (15 oz.) pkg Oreo cookies
      1 c  (8 oz.) margarine, melted
      1 c  (8 oz.) confectioner's
           -sugar

      2 sm (8 oz.) tubs Cool Whip
      2 sm Boxes Jello instant
           -chocolate pudding
 
  1. Crush entire package of Oreos to fine consistancy (potato masher
  works fine for this). Saving out 1/2 cup of Oreo crumbs for later
  use, mix remaining crumbs and melted margarine and press in bottom of
  9 X 13 baking pan. Tamp firmly with spoon or spatula. 2. Place in
  refrigerator for 5 minutes. 3. In large mixing bowl, combine
  confectioner's sugar, cream cheese and one (1) tub of cool whip. Beat
  with electric mixer until thoroughly mixed. Note: Items will mix much
  more easily if cream cheese and cool whip have been set out at room
  temperature ahead of time. 4. Retrieve pan from refrigerator, spread
  cream cheese/Cool Whip/sugar mixture evenly over Oreo crust. Spread
  carefully, as crust will have tendancy to stick to mixture. Return to
  refrigerator. 5. Prepare both boxes of chocolate pudding according to
  package directions. Then quickly retrieve pan from refrigerator and
  spread over top of previous layer. Return to refrigerator for 5
  minutes. 6. Retrieve pan from refrigerator and spread remaining tub
  of Cool Whip evenly over pudding layer. 7. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of Oreo
  crumbs (set aside earlier) over top of Cool Whip layer. 8.

  been thoroughly tossed, place mound on each plate. Pour dressing over
  top and serve immediately.
