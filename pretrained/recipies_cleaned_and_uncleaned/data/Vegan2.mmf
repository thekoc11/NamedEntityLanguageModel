      Title: Akpith (Corn/maize and bean flour snack)
 Categories: Snacks, Breads, African, Vegan
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Corn/maize meal
    1/2 c  Soy flour
  1 1/2 tb Baking powder
    1/2 ts Chili powder (optional)
           Sugar to taste
      1 c  Water
           Oil
           Salt and pepper
 
  Corn/maize was introduced to Africa from Latin America by the Portuguese,
  mainly to provision their slave ships.  The grain was quickly accepted
  because it grew rapidly and undemanding in cultivation.  The name 'maize'
  comes from 'mahiz', the word used by the Caribbean Taino Indians from whom
  the Europeans probably first learned about the crop.  in North American
  the English settlers were shown it by local Indians.  'Corn' was a general
  name given to any grain, so they called it simply 'Indian corn'.
  
  Columbus noted that maize was "most tasty boiled, roasted or ground into
  flour".  And in southern Ghana today a common food is 'kenkey', fermented
  corn/maize flour balls, wrapped in corn/maize leaves and steamed.  Akpith,
  this recipe, is more straightforward.
  
  DIRECTIONS:
  ===========
  In a large saucepan, boil the water and then in half of the corn/maize
  meal and all the soy flour to make a thick porridge.  Add the baking
  powder, chili powder if using and sugar; season.
  
  Cook this for 10 minutes over a low heat, stirring constantly.  Then
  remove the pan and set aside to cool for 10 minutes or so.
  
  At this point, mix in the remaining corn/maize meal and combine
  thoroughly, adding water to produce a stiff dough.
  
  Now pour enough oil into a pan or wok to give a depth of around 2 inches
  (5 cms), and heat up.  While it is warming mould the dough into balls
  about 1 inch (2.5 cms) in diameter.
  
  With the oil sizzling hot, slide 4 or 5 balls carefully into the pan and
  cook for 2-3 minutes until they are golden brown.

  add the bay leaf & bring to a gentle boil, stirring constantly.  When
  boiling, reduce heat to very low & simmer for about 1 minute or until
  the sauce starts to thicken.  Set aside.
  
  Oil a casserole dish.  Put a layer of lasagna in the bottom & layer
  with the lentil mixture followed by the bechamel sauce.  Repeat,
  ending with a layer of bechamel.  Top with shredded soy cheese if
  desired.  Bake at 350F for 35 minutes.  Let stand for 10 minutes

           Salt & pepper
           Water or stock to cover
 
  In the bottom of a large casserole dish, arrange the turnip slices &
  sprinkle with the nutmeg.  Layer the rest of the vegetables in order,
  sprinkling in the herbs after each layer.  Top with the soaked beans.
  Pour over enough water or stock to cover & season with salt & pepper.
  Cover with a good tight-fitting lid & place in an oven pre-heated to
  300F. Cook for 3 hours.  If you desire, add dumplings & cook for a

  NOTE: I made this recipe to emphaise the taste of the root vegetables.
  Add whatever vegetables & herbs you wish.  I used black beans to add
  some protein.  If exchanging legumes, be sure to use ones that can
  stand a lot of cooking, kidney beans or chick peas, for example.

      Title: Boiled Pot-Stickers (Shwei Jow)
 Categories: Vegetarian, Vegan, Chinese, Appetizers
      Yield: 24 servings
 
----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      8 oz Regular or firm tofu
      2 tb Black mushrooms, minced
           -(OR Shiitake mushrooms)
           -- (presoaked)
      2 tb Presoaked minced tree ear
      1 tb Dried lily buds, minced
           -- (presoaked)
      1 tb Green onion, minced
    1/2 ts Salt
  2 1/4 ts Soy sauce
  2 1/4 ts Sesame oil

----------------------------------WRAPPERS----------------------------------
      1 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Water

-------------------------------DIPPING SAUCE-------------------------------
           Soy sauce
           Vinegar
           Mushroom soaking liquid
           -OR- water
           Sesame oil (optional)
           Chile oil (optional)
 
  Mash the tofu to yield about 3/4 cup.
  
  To make the filling, combine mashed tofu with the minced ingredients,
  salt, soy sauce, and sesame oil.
  
  To make the wrappers, mix flour and water by hand, kneading just enough to
  make a ball of dough. Cover and let rest for at least an hour.
  
  Place on a lightly floured board, and knead for 2 minutes or so.  With
  palms of your hands, roll it into a long, cylindrical shape, 12 inches
  inches long, 1 inch in diameter.  Cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces; you
  will have 24.  If your climate is dry, keep the dough covered.  Shape
  these, cut-side up, into a round shape.  Flatten them with the palm or
  heel of your hand on a flour-dusted board.  With a pastry roller, small
  rolling pin, piece of dowel, or even an empty jar -- all of these should
  be wielded under the palm of your hand -- roll each into a round wrapper,
  3 inches in diameter, thicker in the center, thinner toward the edge. This
  is easily done by rolling the pastry roller from the edge of the piece of
  dough to the center, and back again, turning the dough counterclockwise a
  little with your left hand after each roll.  Continue all the way around
  several times, also turning the dough over once or twice, until you have a
  thin, 3-inch wrapper.
  
  To assemble, place 1-1/2 teaspoons filling (or as much as the wrapper will
  hold) in an elongated mound in the center of each wrapper; fold the dough
  over the filling so that the edges meet.  Press the edges together for a
  tight seal, at the same time making four or five tiny pleats, pinched
  tightly flush with the edge.  Be sure that it is completely sealed to keep
  the water out and the filling in.  (With commecial wrappers, it may be
  necessary to moisten half of the inside edge first to get a seal.)
  
  Bring 4 cups water to the boil in a pot.  Immerse eight dumplings at a
  time for 3 minutes (add an extra minute if frozen -- do not defrost them
  first).  Lest they break open, add a little water to slow the boil
  whenever it becomes too rapid.  Stir occasionally in case some of them
  stick to the bottom (true to their name).  After 3 minutes, remove the
  dumplings with a slotted spoon.  Cook the remaining two batches in the
  same way.
  
  Serve hot, accompanied by small dipping saucers of soy sauce and vinegar
  (cider or Chinese dark), mixed in roughly equal proportions, or to taste,
  and thinned with water or mushroom liquid if too strong; add perhaps a
  drop of sesame and/or chile oil.  Some people like to add a little crushed
  garlic, minced green onion, and/or gingerroot.
  
  Advance preparation: These can be assembled ahead and frozen. Do not
  defrost before cooking.

      Title: Chestnut and Rice Savoury
 Categories: Vegetarian, Vegan
      Yield: 1 serving
 
      1 sm Onion
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      1 sm Tomato
      1 c  Mushrooms
    1/2 c  Brown rice, cooked
      2 oz Dried chestnuts
      2 tb Water
      1 ts Yeast extract
      1 ts Tomato paste
 
  Cover the chestnuts with boiling water and leave them to soak for several
  hours, then cook them until tender.  (If the chestnuts are soaked in warm
  water in a wide-rimmed thermos flask, or in a warm cupboard, them may be
  tender enough not to require more cooking.)
  
  Chop the onion and saute it in the oil in a saucepan for about 3 minutes.
  
  Skin and chop the tomato.  Slice the mushrooms.  Add them to the pan and
  cook for a further 3 minutes or so.
  
  Add the rice and chestnuts to the pan and stir well.  Then add the water,
  yeast extract and tomato paste.  Mix together very thoroughly as it heats
  up so that the yeast extract is amalgamated evenly into the mixture.
  Continue cooking over a gentle heat until all the ingredients are well
  heated.

      Title: Cranberry Fritters
 Categories: Desserts, Vegetarian, Vegan
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8 oz Cranberry jelly, canned
      5 tb Flour
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Sugar
      5 tb Water
           Vegetable oil
           -- for deep-frying
           Flour; for dredging
 
  Cranberry tartness suggests the original Chinese ingredient, a firm,
  gelatinous jelly flavored with the hawthorn berry (or 'shan dza', which in
  northern China is pureed to make a delicious tart, thick, cooling drink).
  Enclosed within a light, deep-fried batter, the strips of jelly become hot
  and soft or, in the case of cranberry, almost liquid.  Buy the "jellied
  cranberry sauce", not the whole-berry type.
  
  This recipe makes three to four small servings.
  
  DIRECTIONS:
  ===========
  Cut the jelly crosswise into three round slices, 1/2 inch thick.  Cut each
  slice into three strips, approximately 1/2 x 1/2 x 2-1/2 inches.
  
  Prepare a batter by blending the flour, baking powder, sugar, and water.
  
  Heat oil for deep-frying; after it is hot, keep the heat around
  medium-high.  Dredge the cranberry jelly strips lightly in flour, making
  sure all sides, including the ends, are dusted.  Then dip them in the
  batter to coat completely, and immerse them in the oil until golden brown.
  Fry only a few at a time.  Drain on paper toweling, and eat while hot.

      Title: Elegant Chestnut Soup
 Categories: Soups, Appetizers, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 c  Chestnuts, roasted & peeled
      1 tb Oil
    1/2 c  Onion, finely chopped
    1/4 c  Celery, chopped
  2 1/4 c  Water
    3/4 c  Apple juice
      1 ts Tamari
      1    Vegetable bouillon cube

----------------------------------OPTIONAL----------------------------------
      1 ds Nutmeg
 
  * To roast chestnuts: Choose fresh, firm, unwrinkled chestnuts with no
  signs of mold. On the flat side of each chestnut make 2 cuts with a
  small, sharp knife, from one end to the other in the shape of an X.
  Place the chestnuts, cut side up, on a low baking sheet with a thin
  layer of water on the bottom. Bake the chestnuts for 20-25 minutes at
  350F until browned and the cuts peel back naturally from the heat.
  Test one chestnut to be sure its "meat" is tender. When tender,
  remove from oven, cool only slightly, peel and enjoy or use in
  recipes. Some people like to boil the cut chestnuts for easier
  peeling. This is okay, though some nutrients and flavour will be lost.
  
   Prepare chestnuts. Peel off the outer shell and the fuzzy skin before
  using the inner chestnut meat.
  
    Heat the oil until hot and saute the onion until semi-tender. Add
  the celery and saute until both are very tender. Blend the water and
  apple juice with the chestnuts and all the remaining ingredients*.
  Simmer everything on low to medium heat (do NOT boil!) for about
  15-20 minutes or until hot throughout and the flavours mingle. Enjoy
  this rich and tantalizing soup with extra chopped or ground nuts as a
  garnish.
  
  Keeps 4-6 days refrigerated.
  
  *Two vegetable bouillon cubes may be used instead of the tamari or
  miso. Also, 1/2 cup applesauce and 2 1/2 cups water can be used
  instead of the juice and 2 1/4 cups water. *Anne's note: I would
  assume by reading this, she means blend these ingredients in a
  blender and return to the pot.

      Title: Granola
 Categories: Bakery, Breakfast, Cereals
      Yield: 12 servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Quick-cooking oatmeal
      1 c  Shredded coconut
    1/3 c  Untoasted sunflower seeds
    1/4 c  Hulled sesame seeds
      4 tb Margarine
    1/4 c  (packed) dark brown sugar
    1/4 c  Honey
    1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 c  Toasted wheat germ
    1/2 c  Raisins
 
  Preheat the oven to 300F.
  
  Spread the oatmeal, coconut, sunflower seeds and sesame seeds in a
  large, lightly  buttered roasting pan or ovenproof dish (about 11x17
  inches is best, although a smaller pan will do).  Bake for about 20
  minutes, tossing several times.
  
  Meanwhile, combine in a small saucepan the margarine, brown sugar,
  honey and salt and bring to a simmer, stirring.  Add the vanilla off
  the heat.
  
  Reset the oven to 350~ then add the wheat germ to the toasted mixture.
  Dribble the sugar-honey mixture syrup over the granola, tossing with
  a fork to coat the dry mixture evenly.
  
  Return the pan to the oven and bake for 5-6 minutes longer.  Add the
  raisins, toss to distribute, and press the granola down firmly into
  an even layer. Bake 5 minutes or so longer, or until the granola is
  golden.
  
  Remove from the oven and let cool slightly.  Slip a flexible spatula
  under the granola to break in to large pieces.  Let cool completely
  and store airtight.
  
  Makes 6 cups.

      Title: Green-and-Gold Relish
 Categories: Salads, Vegetables, Chinese, Vegan, Relishes
      Yield: 1 recipe
 
     10 oz Greens; Spinach -OR-
           -- Garland chrysanthemum
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Cider vinegar
           -OR- Chinese dark vinegar
  1 1/2 ts Sesame oil
 
  NOTE: Buy 11 ounces of greens (if stems of garland chysanthemum are
  thick, buy 14 ounces) in order to have 10 ounces after trimming.  Include
  stems of both vegetables; however, if garland chysanthemum stems exceed
  1/4 inch in thickness, do not use them for this recipe since they may be
  too firm, tough, or stringy.
  
  Wilt the greens by immersing them in a large pot of boiling water for 30
  seconds (or steam in a vegetable basket, 1-1/2 minutes for spinach, 2-1/2
  minutes for garland chysanthemum, stirring once or twice).
  
  Rinse in cold water to stop the cooking.  Divide into two or three bunches
  and firmly squeeze out the water.  Chop each handful at 1/2-inch
  intervals, then turn and chop in a cross direction.  Squeeze again if the
  greens are still watery, then loosen them by a light crumbling motion and
  place in a bowl.
  
  Pour boiling water over the bamboo shoot to freshen it; rinse under cool
  water and dice finely (1/4 inch thick).
  
  Toss all ingredients together.  Let sit a few minutes at room temperature,
  and test for seasonings, adding perhaps an extra 1/4 teaspoon sugar with
  garland chysanthemum.  Serve chilled or at room temperature.

      Yield: 12 servings
 
      2 c  Cooked pinto beans
    1/2 c  Whole wheat breadcrumbs
    1/2 c  Onion, minced
      1    Garlic clove; minced
    1/2 c  Tomato sauce
    1/8 ts Fennel seed, crushed
    1/8 ts Dried red pepper
    1/8 ts Dried basil; -OR-
    1/2 ts -Fresh basil
  1 1/2 ts Chopped fresh parsley
           Salt; to taste

-------------------------MUSHROOM-RED PEPPER SAUCE-------------------------
      1    Red bell pepper; minced
    1/8 c  Vegetable broth or water
           -OR- more as needed
      4 lg Mushrooms; minced
    1/4 c  Onion; minced
           Salt; to taste
    1/8 ts Celery seed
    1/2 ts Chopped fresh oregano
      1 ds Black pepper
           Whole wheat flour
           -- (pastry flour works best)
 
  These plant-based sausages taste great, contain no added fat except the
  vegetable oil they're fried in, and are easy to make.  These ingredients
  yield fairly mild sausages; after you've tried them, adjust the seasonings
  to please your palate.
  
  DIRECTIONS:
  ===========
  Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl, mix thoroughly, and shape into
  1- to 2-inch sausages.  Saute in a small amount of vegetable oil until
  crisp, or place in a baking pan and broil, turning when edges are slightly
  crisp.  Serve with Mushroom-Red Pepper Sauce (below).
  
  MUSHROOM-RED PEPPER SAUCE:  Cook red pepper in vegetable broth for 5 to 7
  minutes until tender.  Add mushrooms, onion, salt, celery seed, oregano,
  and black pepper.  Cook 5 minutes longer or until onion is transparent.
  Quickly whisk in enough flour to just thicken the sauce, about 2
  tablespoons at a time.  Immediately remove from burner.  Do not overcook,
  or flour will cake.  If needed, add more vegetable broth or water.  Serve
  over sausages, whole grains, or vegetables.

      8 c  Vegetable stock
      8 sl Ginger, peeled
    1/2    Lime, peeled & sliced thin

      1 lb Firm tofu, cut into chunks
           Cilantro, chopped
 
  Rinse the mushrooms, put them in a small saucepan and cover with
  water. Bring them to a boil on high heat and swish the mushrooms to
  remove excess dirt. Discard the water. Rinse. Once again, cover the
  mushrooms and bring them to a boil, covered. Let sit 1 hour. Then
  drain, remove tough stems, squeeze out excess water and slice or cut
  in half. Bring the stock to a boil in a large saucepan on high heat,
  add the ginger and lime slices and cook for 2-3 minutes. Lower the
  heat and add the lime and lemon juice, soy sauce and chilies. Simmer
  for 5 minutes. Add tofu and mushrooms and simmer 5 more minutes.
  Taste to check the balance of hot, sour and salt -- none should
  overwhelm the other -- and add more chilies, lime juice or soya sauce
  as needed.
  
  Serve garnished with chopped cilantro. Have a side dish of extra
  sliced chilies for those who like it hot. Keeps a few days
  refrigerated but it is best served fresh.

      Title: Jim's Orange Marmalade
 Categories: Conserves, Jams, Fruits
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Seville oranges (about 5)
      1    Lemon
      6 c  Water
  7 1/2 c  Sugar
 
  Directions: Put 4 small saucers in freezer. In a very large pot,
  combine oranges, lemon and water. Cover and bring to a simmer. Let
  simmer 2 hours. DON'T ALLOW TO BOIL. Turn off heat. Remove fruit. Let
  cool 5 minutes. Cut in half and scoop pulp, seeds and pith back into
  pan. Put shells to one side.  Bring pan to a boil and boil hard 5
  minutes. Strain through damp cheese cloth in a seive. Gather ends and
  squeeze out remaining juice. You should have 6 cups. Make up any
  difference with water. Return liquid to pan.  Remove all white pith
  from skins. Cut skins in fine strips (or as desired) and add to pan
  with sugar. Place over low heat and stir to dissolve sugar.  Bring to
  boil. Boil hard, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching.  Boil
  hard til jell point is reached, between 60 and 90 minutes depending
  on natural fruit pectin available. Jell point test. Chill some
  saucers in freezer while preparing marmalade, 2 or 3. Test: drop a
  small amount of hot marmalade on chilled plate and chill for 2
  minutes. Run finger through marmelade on plate.  If surface wrinkles,
  it has reached jelling point.  If still syrupy, continue boiling.
  Repeat test at 5 minute intervals til jell point is reached.  Remove
  pan from stove and stir for 5 minutes, skimming off any foam.  Ladle
  into sterilized jars, leaving 1/2 inch head space.  Seal as you like.

  & place in a colander.  Sprinkle with salt & let stand 5 minutes.
  
  Heat oil in casserole.  Brown eggplant with 1 tb chopped onions, 1 tb
  chopped ginger, 1 jalapeno, whole garlic & bell pepper for 5 minutes.

  make unifying background for other elements. Taste soup and season to
  taste with salt and generous grinding of pepper. If possible, set

      1 c  Dried lima beans
           -Water for soaking, plus
      4 c  Water for cooking
      3 md Potatoes
      2 lg Carrots
      1 lg Onion; diced
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/4 ts Fennel seed
    1/2 ts Thyme
    1/2 ts Marjoram
      2    Garlic cloves
           -- finely chopped
      2 tb Water
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
      4 oz Mushrooms; thinly sliced
      1 sm Bulb fennel; diced
      1    Bay leaf
      1 tb Tamari
      1 tb Lemon juice
 
  Pick over and wash lima beans, and soak them in water to cover at least 6
  hours or overnight.  Drain off the soaking water and place the limas in a
  large stewpot with fresh water.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and
  simmer gently for 1 hour.
  
  Scrub the potatoes and carrots.  Cut the potatoes in 1/2-inch dice.  Cut
  the carrots in half lengthwise, then crosswise into 1/4-inch slices.  Add
  the potatoes and carrots to the limas.  While they are cooking, saute the
  onion in 1 tablespoon of oil until golden brown.
  
  Crush the fennel seed lightly in a mortar and add it along with the thyme,
  marjoram, garlic, and 2 tablespoons of water to the onion.  Cook over low
  heat for 3 minutes to blend the flavors.  Add the wine and simmer until
  the liquid is reduced a little. Scrape the onion mixture into the bean
  mixture and return the skillet to the burner.  Saute the mushrooms in the
  remaining tablespoon oil until they turn golden around the edges.  Add the
  mushrooms to the stew, adding more water if necessary to keep the stew
  from sticking.
  
  Add the diced fennel bulb, bay leaf, and tamari, and simmer about 10
  minutes or until the fennel bulb is just tender.  Add the lemon and serve
  immediately.

 Categories: Main dish, Rice, Vegetarian, Mark's
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 c  Cooked rice
      1 lg Onion, finely chopped
      2    Garlic cloves, minced
      1 lg Carrot, scrubbed & diced
      1 md Green pepper, diced
    1/2 c  Frozen corn &/or peas
      1    3" piece ginger, sliced
    1/2 ts Chili pieces
           Soy sauce
           Salt & pepper, to taste
 
  Ensure that the rice has been cooked ahead of time & is well cooled.
  
  Heat about 2 to 3 tb vegetable oil in a wok.  When hot, add onions &
  garlic & fry for 3 minutes.  Add the carrots & stir-fry for 2 minutes.
  Add the rest of the vegetables & continue to stir-fry for 2 or 3
  minutes. Toss in the chili pieces & ginger root.  Cook for a few
  seconds. Carefully stir in the cold rice.  Lower heat & continue to
  cook, stirring occasionally for 5 minutes.  Add enough soy sauce to
  coat the rice & cook for a further 5 minutes on low heat, stirring
  often to prevent sticking. Season if desired with salt & pepper.
  Serve when heated through.
  
  This goes great with spicy tofu dishes or works well on its own as a
  main dish in its own right.
  
  If you desire something hotter, add more chili pieces. Use pieces
  rather than powder because they are hotter.
  
  For a variation, I sometimes toss in a few strips of tofu just before
  adding the spices.

      1 tb Nutritional yeast flakes
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Garlic powder
      1 ts Poultry seasoning
    1/2 ts Onion powder
      3 tb Vegetable oil

-----------------------------CHICKENLESS GRAVY-----------------------------
      2 c  Boiling water
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      3 tb Nutritional yeast
      1    Vegetable bouillon cube
    1/2 c  Diced fresh mushrooms
    1/2 c  Finely chopped onion
           Onion salt; to taste
           Unbleached all-purpose flour
 
  Steam the spinach and drain well.
  
  Heat the oil or water in a medium frying pan over medium heat.  Cook
  the onion, stirring occasionally, until transparent, about 5 minutes.
  
  Dissolve the imitation chicken-flavored powder or bouillon powder in
  the boiling water.  Add the TVP and let stand for about 10 minutes.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Pat the tofu dry, then mash.  In a large bowl, combine the TVP
  mixture, spinach and tofu.  Stir in the remaining ingredients and
  pour the mixture into a lightly greased 8-1/2 x 4-1/2-inch loaf pan.
  Smooth the top and bake for 45 minutes, or until brown on top.
  
  If the loaf begins to get too brown on top, cover with aluminum foil.
  Make the gravy.  In a large suacpan, simmer all the ingredients
  except the flour for approximately 5 minutes.  Slowly add the flour
  (tablespoon by tablespoon), whisking after each addition, until
  desired thickness is reached.  Keep warm.
  
  Let loaf stand for 10 mintues, then run a knife around the edges and
  turn out onto a platter.  Serve with gravy.

 Categories: Desserts, Cakes, Vegan
      Yield: 8 servings
 
    3/4 c  Margarine
  2 1/4 c  Sugar
           Egg replacer
           -- (equivalent of 3 eggs)
      3 tb Fresh lemon juice
      1 pn Salt
  2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
  2 1/2 ts Baking powder
    3/4 c  Soy milk, plain or vanilla
      2 c  Chopped walnuts or almonds
    1/2 c  Vegan marzipan
 
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
  
  To prepare the dough, cream the margarine with 3/4 cup sugar until fluffy.
  Add the egg replacer, lemon juice, and salt and mix well.  Add the flour
  and baking powder, and mix until a soft dough is formed.
  
  Place two-thirds of the dough on a sheet of plastic wrap.  With a rolling
  pin, roll the dough into a circle about 11 inches in diameter.  Invert the
  dough into a 9-inch springform pan.  Peel the plastic wrap off the dough
  and press the dough into the bottom and up the sides of the pan.  Trim the
  edges if needed.  Roll the remaining dough into a circle about 9 inches in
  diameter and set aside.  This will be used to top the torte.
  
  To prepare the filling, stir 1 cup of the sugar in a large heavy saucepan
  over low heat until the sugar is dissolved.  Increase the heat and boil
  the sugar unti it turns a caramel color.  Add the soy milk (which will
  bubble vigorously) along with the nuts and the rest of the sugar.  Cook
  over high heat, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat
  and beat the marzipan into the mixture.  When it is well mixed, pour it
  into the cake pan and put the rolled-out dough on top.
  
  Bake the torte until golden brown, about 35 minutes.  Cool completely
  before removing the springform.

  These little open-faced steamed dumplings, a popular item in dim sum
  teahouses, are a special treat, for you seldom see a vegetarian version.
  With their flowerlike appearance and savory filling, they are an
  attractive luncheon dish.  You can use the ready-made wrappers, sold in
  refrigerated or frozen sections of some markets ("shu mai skins").  "Suey
  gow skins" or "gyoza wrappers" are too thick and will dry out during
  steaming.  Wonton wrappers can be substituted, but trim off the pointed
  corners.  Better yet, prepare your own wrappers according to the
  directions below.
  
  DIRECTIONS:
  ===========
  To prepare wrappers, combine flour and hot water.  Knead a couple of
  minutes into a smooth dough; cover and let rest at least 1 hour.  Place on
  a lightly floured board, and knead for 2 minutes or so.  With palms of
  your hands, roll it into a long, cylindrical shape, 7-1/2 inches inches
  long, 1 inch in diameter.  Cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces; you will
  have 15.  If your climate is dry, keep the dough covered.  Shape these,
  cut-side up, into a round shape.  Flatten them with the palm or heel of
  your hand on a flour-dusted board.  With a pastry roller, small rolling
  pin, piece of dowel, or even an empty jar -- all of these should be
  wielded under the palm of your hand -- roll each into a round wrapper,
  3-1/2 inches in diameter, thicker in the center, thinner toward the edge.
  This is easily done by rolling the pastry roller from the edge of the
  piece of dough to the center, and back again, turning the dough
  counterclockwise a little with your left hand after each roll.  Continue
  all the way around several times, also turning the dough over once or
  twice, until you have a thin, 3-1/2 inch wrapper.
  
  Prepare Filling A or B by combining the ingredients.  Place approximately
  1 tablespoon filling on the center of each wrapper.  Holding the wrapper
  on your left fingers, encircle it from below with your right thumb and
  index finger, gathering the wrapper up around the filling.  Squeeze gently
  around the middle to make a kind of neck; some of the filling should
  emerge at the top.  The bundle should hold together securely or it will
  collapse during steaming.  Pat the bottom with your left hand to make a
  flat base.  If the skin is not too floppy, you can also turn the edge
  slightly outward (like an open flower), pinching it if necessary to make
  it secure.
  
  Place a layer of damp cloth in a bamboo steaming basket or on a flat,
  perforated race (you can use a heatproof plate if you have neither of
  these, but circulation of steam is somewhat impaired this way).  Arrange
  the shao mai on it.  With the rack well above the boiling water in a
  steamer, steam for 10 minutes (if frozen, do not defrost first).  They
  will stick to the cloth, but if you wash and reuse the same cloth each
  time, they will not stick as much.
  
  Serve while still hot, before the skin hardens -- as is, or with small
  dipping saucers of soy sauce and mushroom liquid (from the black
  mushrooms), mixed in equal proportions.  Add a few drops of sesame oil.
  
  Advance preparation: These can be assembled in advance, frozen, and
  steamed just prior to serving.

      1    Bay leaf
      6    Sage leaves; -=OR=-

      5 tb Fruity olive oil
      4    Garlic cloves

      1 md Red onion, finely diced
      3 pn Red pepper flakes
     12 oz Penne, ziti or shell pasta
           Freshly ground pepper
 
  Shell the beans then put them in a pan with water to cover; add the
  bay leaf, half the sage and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Slice 1 of
  the garlic cloves and add it to the pan along with the carrot. Salt
  lightly and simmer until the beans are tender, about 30 minutes. Add
  more water, if needed. When beans are tender, set them aside in the
  liquid. Remove tough stems of the greens; roughly chop leaves. Heat 2
  tablespoons of the oil in a skillet and gently wilt the onion. Chop
  the remaining garlic and sage leaves and add them to the onion, along
  with the red pepper flakes. Cook for a few minutes, then add the
  greens. Add 1/2 cup or so of cooking water from the beans and salt to
  taste; cook until greens are tender, about 15 minutes. When greens
  are done, add beans and enough liquid to make a little sauce. Cook
  the pasta in a large pot of boiling, salted water. When it is done,
  scoop it out and add it directly to the greens and beans. Toss them
  together, then turn into a heated serving dish. Drizzle the remaining
  olive oil over the top, season with plenty of pepper and freshly
  grated cheese.

      Title: Peach Chutney
 Categories: Conserves, Fruits, Karen's
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 lb Peeled, pitted peaches
           -- cut into small chunks
    3/4 c  White or cider vinegar
      3 c  Water
      1 lb Brown and/or white sugar
      1    Head of garlic
      8 sl Crystallized ginger
      4    Red chilie peppers, fresh
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Ground cumin
      1 ts Ground coriander
      1 ts Ground cloves
 
  Put peaches, vinegar and water into a pot and bring to a boil.  Add
  sugar and continue to cook.
  
  Meanwhile, separate and peel garlic cloves.  Remove stems from chilie
  peppers (and seeds as well, if a mild chutney is desired).  Mince
  garlic, chilies, and ginger, then add them to peach mixture.
  
  Stir in remaining ingredients and cook until mixture is thick and
  reduced to about 6 cups.  Stir often, and reduce heat if necessary to
  prevent burning.
  
  Preserve his chutney at your own risk, I have no idea if the
  proportions given are safe for home canning!  Me, I'll just keep it
  in the 'fridge since it's likely to be consumed within a couple of
  weeks.  :-)

      Title: Peking Style Noodles with Bean Sauce and Mixed Garnish
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian, Vegan, Chinese
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      8 oz Noodles
           -- (3-4 cups after cooking)
      6 oz Plain pressed tofu
    1/2 c  Green soybeans
           -- (frozen or fresh)  -OR-
      2 oz -Baby corn spears
    1/2 c  Bamboo shoot, diced finely
      2 oz Cucumber
      1 ts Garlic, minced
      3 tb Chinese bean sauce; -OR-
      4 tb -Dark miso
      3 tb Vegetable oil
  1 1/2 c  Water
  1 1/2 tb Soy sauce
    1/2 ts Sugar
  2 1/2 tb Cornstarch; dissolved in...
      3 tb Water
    1/2 ts Sesame oil
 
  If you are cooking the noodles first, drain them, remove to a bowl or
  serving platter, and toss with 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to prevent
  sticking (do not rinse in cold water as this reduces flavor).
  
  Crumble the pressed tofu coarsely to yield 1-1/2 cups.
  
  Parboil green soybeans till almost tender yet still firm (10 minutes for
  frozen).  If using fresh baby corn spears, steam or parboil till tender;
  if canned, rinse with boiling water.  Rinse green soybeans or corn in cold
  water and chop finely.  You should have about 1/2 cup baby corn.
  
  It is not necessary to peel or seed the hothouse (English) or Oriental
  cucumber.  Regular cucumber should be pared and seeded, but leave a few
  narrow strips of skin for color and texture.  Julienne finely to yield
  1/2 cup.
  
  If you are using miso, dissolve it in 1/4 cup warm water.
  
  Put 3 tablespoons oil into a preheated pan over high.  When the oil is
  hot, reduce heat to medium-high.  Add garlic and stir-fry a few seconds to
  release aroma.  Add pressed tofu and bean sauce or miso.  Stir-fry briefly
  to mix.  Add 1-1/2 cups water, 1 tablepsoon soy sauce, and 1/2 teaspoon
  sugar.  Cook, stirring occasionally, until the boil is reached.  Gradually
  stir in cornstarch mixture and cook, stirring, another minute or so until
  the consistency is like a light gravy, not too thick.  Test for salt, and
  add an extra tablespoon soy sauce if needed.  (at this point, if you like,
  you can heat noodles and/or green soybeans, baby corn, and bamboo shoot by
  combining with the sauce until just mixed.)  Add 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil.
  Remove from the stove.  Pour sauce over noodles, and top with garnish in
  separate arrangement (garnish with just the cucumber if you have added
  soybeans or baby corn and bamboo shoot to the sauce).  Toss before
  serving.

      Title: Sauteed Green Beans & Mushrooms
 Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Fresh green beans
      2 tb Salt
    1/2 lb Mushrooms
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Unsalted butter
      3 tb Pine nuts
      1 ts Chopped fresh tarragon-=OR=-
    1/4 ts Dried tarragon
 
  Snap both ends off the beans and pull off any strings. Cut large pole
  beans crosswise into 2-inch pieces. Don't cut smaller French haricots
  verts. Fill a mixing bowl or medium pot with 4 cups cold water and
  add 1 tray of ice cubes. Set aside. Bring 4 quarts of water with 2
  tablespoons kosher salt to a boil over high heat and add the beans.
  The water will stop boiling when you add the beans. After it has
  returned to the boil, cook the beans, uncovered, until tender but
  still crisp. This will take from 3 to 5 minutes depending on the size
  and age of the beans. Remember that this is only a preliminary
  preparation so do not overcook the beans. Drain the beans and place
  them immediately into the ice water. Stir until cool, then drain.
  Spread the beans on towels and pat dry. Meanwhile, slice mushrooms
  thinly and set aside on a plate. Heat the oil and butter in a medium
  skillet over medium heat and add the pine nuts and mushrooms. If
  using dried tarragon, add it now. Cook, stirring, about 5 minutes.
  Add the green beans and fresh tarragon and cook until beans are hot,
  about 3 minutes longer. Transfer to a serving platter and serve
  immediately.

 Categories: Beverages, Finnish
      Yield: 24 servings
 
     10 qt Water, fresh pure
      2    Lemons
  2 1/2 c  Brown sugar
  2 1/2 c  White sugar
    1/3 c  Dark corn syrup, optional
    1/4 ts Dry yeast
           Raisins
 
  Shave the yellow peel from the lemons, cutting very thinly so that as
  little of the white underlayer as possible is attached. Set the yellow
  slices aside. Then peel the bitter white underlayer off and discard
  it. Slice the lemons into very thin slices. Place them into a
  container and cover them so they don't dry out.
  
  Boil the water in a large kettle. Remove it from the heat and stir in
  the yellow lemon peel, the sugars, and the syrup. When the sugars have
  dissolved, cover the kettle and let the contents cool to room
  temperature. Then add the lemon slices and the yeast. Leave it to
  stand overnight.
  
  Place 4-5 raisins and a teaspoon of white sugar in the bottom of each
  of several clean bottles (wine or soda pop). Pour the sima into the
  bottles, straining it through a sieve to remove the lemon. Cap the
  bottle tightly. The sima will be ready to drink when the raisins rise
  to the top of the bottles, about 3-7 days depending on the
  temperature of the room where they are stored. Serve it well chilled.

           -- for deep-frying

----------------------------------GARNISH----------------------------------
           Lemon wedges
           Coriander or parsley

--------------------------------MANGO RELISH--------------------------------
    1/4 c  Medium-sweet sherry
    1/4 c  -Water
    1/4 c  2hite wine vinegar
      2 tb Sugar
      1    Cinnamon stick
      1    Star anise
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 pn Ground mace
      1    Mango
           -- peeled, pitted and diced
      1 sm Red bell pepper
           -- seeded and diced
      1 tb Lemon juice
 
  Place the eggplant in a colander, sprinkle with the salt, and let drain
  while preparing the other vegetables.
  
  Blanch the zucchini and cauliflower florets separately for 2 minutes in
  boiling water.  Drain, refresh under cold water, and dry well.  Rinse the
  eggplant and pat dry.
  
  Combine the flour, coriander, salt, and curry powder in a large bowl.
  Gradually beat in the oil, lemon juice, and water until the batter is the
  consistency of heavy cream.  Alternatively, place all the ingredients -
  except the water - in a food processor, and with the motor running, pour
  the water through the funnel until you have the right consistency.
  
  Heat 4 inches of oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan to 350 degrees F.
  
  Lightly whisk the batter and dip the vegetables in batches of 5 to 6, then
  slip them carefully into the hot oil.  Fry the pakoras for 2 to 3 minutes
  on each side, turning them with a slotted spoon.  Remove from the pan,
  drain on paper towels, and keep warm in a moderate oven while you cook the
  remaining pakoras.  Allow the oil to come back to 350 degrees F between
  batches.
  
  When all the vegetables are ready, garnish with lemon wedges and coriander
  or parsley and serve at once with the mango relish.
  
  MANGO RELISH:  Place the sherry, water, vinegar, sugar, cinnamon, star
  anise, salt, and mace in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan.  Bring to a
  boil and simmer over medium heat for 5 minutes.  Add the mango, bell
  pepper, and lemon juice; lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes more.
  Remove from the heat and let cool completely.  Spoon into a screw top jar
  and refrigerate until required.

    1/2 c  Rice
      2 ts Sugar
    3/4 c  Chopped fresh dill
           Lemon wedges for garnish
 
  Mix juice of 2 lemons & the flour in a large bowl.  Add 2 qt water &
  mix thoroughly.  Wash artichokes, bend back & snap off outer leaves.
  Leave only the tender inner leaves.  Slice off these leaves just
  above the heart & scoop out the fuzzy choke & remaining pinkish
  leaves.  Cut off the stem & peel around the base with a vegetable
  peeler until you reach the whitish tender part.  As you trim each
  artichoke, take a lemon half, sprinkle it with salt & rub it all
  around & inside the base to prevent discoloration. Then drop each
  artichoke into the lemon water mixture.
  
  Remove jackets of fava beans.  Sprinkle beans with salt & let stand
  for 5 minutes.  Remove skins, rinse & reserve.
  
  Heat 1 c olive oil in skillet.  Add onions, 1/2 ts salt & saute for 5
  minutes.  Stir in fava beans & rice.  Cook for 5 minutes, stirring, &
  add 1/2 c water.  Cover & cook for 5 minutes till the water has been
  absorbed. Stir in the dill, salt & remove from heat.  Let stand
  covered for 15 minutes.
  
  Remove artichokes from water bath.  Reserve 4 1/2 c liquid.  Stuff
  centre cavity of artichokes with the rice.  Place each one on a sheet
  of wax paper, sprinkle with a little water & wrap as you would a
  package. Arrange them stem sides down in a heavy shallow pan.  Add 1
  1/2 c reserved liquid, 1/4 c olive oil, juice of 1/2 lemon & sugar.
  Cover & cook over medium heat for 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to low &
  simmer for 1 hour.  The liquid will be continually absorbed so add
  more as needed.  When the artichokes are tender, let them cool,
  Unwrap them & arrange them on a serving platter. Serve cold with
  garnish as part of a buffet.

      Title: Szechuan Style Cabbage Relish
 Categories: Relishes, Vegetables, Appetizers, Vegan, Chinese
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 md Green cabbage

----------------------------------MARINADE----------------------------------
      8 c  Water
      2 tb Szechuan peppercorns
      3 tb Salt
      2 tb -Strong spirits, or up to:
      3 tb Strong spirits
           -- (gin, tequilla, or
           -- kaoliang wine)
      1 c  Icicle radish, julienned
           -- (Optional)
    1/2 c  Carrot, julienned (optional)
      2 sl -Gingerroot, or up to:
      5 sl Gingerroot
      1 sm -Fresh Chile, or up to:
      3 sm Fresh Chiles (optional)
 
  This relish is certainly the most ubiquitous and popular in all China.
  There is even a special earthenware pickling jar for it.  Encircling the
  mouth of the jar is a shallow, water-filled trough, into which the lid
  fits like an upturned bowl, affording an airtigh seal.  Many a restaurant,
  no matter how small, keeps an ongoing batch in the works.  It is
  especially favored as an appetizer or as an accompaniment to such
  specialties as boiled pot-stickers or noodles.
  
  Szechuan is a Western province of China where red pepper frequently
  enlivens the food.  The traditional hot, spicy flavor of this relish
  varies with individual taste; use as much or as little gingerroot and/or
  hot peppers as you like to do the job.  Chiles can be chopped for a really
  hot effect; or for mere warmth, leave them whole with a slit down one
  side.  If you omit the chiles and gingerroot altogether, the resuld will
  be a pleasant pickle flavor with the natural sweetness of the crisp
  vegetables in the forefront.
  
  Green cabbage (not Chinese cabbage) is the principle ingredient, but other
  vegetables may be added for color (carrot) and variety (icicle radish).
  One batch requires several days' steeping.  The brine should be reused,
  for each time the vegetables contribute their flavor, and it gets better
  and better.
  
  DIRECTIONS:
  ===========
  Discard limp outer leaves of cabbage.  It is not necessary to separate
  leaves individually.  Break the head into fairly large yet bite-sized
  pieces.  Pat dry and let excess moisture evaporate.
  
  To make marinade: Brin to a boil the water, peppercorns, and salt.  Strain
  out the peppercorns as you pour the liquid into a plastic container (with
  air-tight lid), ceramic bowl, or crock.  Let cool to room temperature.
  
  When the brine has cooled, add the alcohol, then cabbage and additional
  vegetables.  Weigh these down with a clean, heavy ceramic object (I simply
  use a plate) or stone so that they remain submerged in the brine.  Cover
  tightly with plastic wrap or air-tight lid.  Store in the refrigerator for
  at least three days before uncovering.  The first one or two batches may
  seem a bit salty and raw-tasting; after that a mellow, richly mature
  character develops.  It can store indefinitely if kept cold, airtight, and
  clean.  Always use clean, dry utensils when removing the vegetables.  You
  can remove as much as you want at a time and add new vegetables before the
  previous batch is used up.
  
  To replenish the brine after several batches, add a little alcohol and a
  salt solution (1/2 teaspoon salt boiled with 1/2 cup water).  The original
  marinade can be reboiled with additional water and salt, but this results
  in some flavor loss.
  
  Variation: Shred the marinated cabbage or chop it coarsely, to yield about
  5 cups, loosely packed.  Toss with 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 2-1/2 teaspoons
  sugar, 1 tablespoon vinegar (cider or Chinese dark), and 1-1/2 teaspoons
  sesame oil.  Serve at room temperature or chilled.

  Chop the onion.  Crush the garlic.  Grate the ginger finely.  Chop the
  tomato.

-------------------------------MUSHROOM GRAVY-------------------------------
     20 md Mushrooms
    1/2 c  Chopped onion
      1 tb Olive oil
    1/2 ts Dried oregano; -OR-
      2 ts -Fresh oregano
    1/3 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Unbleached flour
      2 c  -Lentil liquor (from above)
  1 1/2 c  Water
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Black pepper
 
  Cook the lentils, millet, and brown rice separately; and reserve two cups
  of the lentil liquor for making Mushroom Gravy.  If you are using whole
  chestnuts, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Rinse the nuts and cut a
  cross about 1/2 inch deep in the small, pointed ends.  Place the nuts on a
  cookie sheet and bake about 20 minutes, then cool for about 10 minutes.
  Remove the shells and cut the nuts in quarters.
  
  Mix the cooked grains and lentils with the nuts, bread crumbs, and almond
  butter in a large bowl and set aside.
  
  Saute the onions briefly in olive oil, then add the garlic, sage, celery
  seed, rosemary, salt, and seitan if used.  Saute 2 to 3 minutes longer,
  stirring constantly, then add to the other ingredients, mix thoroughly
  (mooshing with fingers works best), and put into a large oiled baking
  dish.  Lightly coat the top of the roast with olive oil, then bake at 350
  degrees F for 1-1/4 hours.  Serve with Mushroom Gravy (below) and garnish
  with parsley.
  
  MUSHROOM GRAVY: Separate the mushroom caps from the stems, then quarter
  the caps and halve the stems.  Saute the onion in olive oil on medium heat
  for 1 minute, then stir in the oregano and add the mushrooms.  Cook,
  stirring constantly, until the mushrooms have softened and the bottom of
  the pan is covered with liquid.  Set aside.
  
  Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat, then stir in the flour and
  cook, stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the lentil liquor and
  water, and continue stirring until the mixture thickens and barely begins
  to boil.  Add the mushroom mixture, salt, and pepper, and continue
  stirring until the gravy begins to boil.  Remove from heat and serve.

  2 1/4 c  Durum flour
    1/2 ts Sea salt
      1 tb Canola oil
    2/3 c  -Very warm water
 
  Combine flours and salt in a large mixing bowl.

      Title: Wild Rice & Hazlenut Salad
 Categories: Salads, Appetizers, Nuts, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    3/4 c  Wild rice
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Hazelnuts
      5 tb Currants
      1 lg Orange, juice only
           Citrus Vinaigrette
           -- with Hazelnut Oil
           -- (See RECIPE)
      1 sm Fennel bulb
           -- cut into small squares
      1    Crisp apple
           Freshly ground black pepper
           Salt
 
  Preheat oven to 350F. Rinse the wild rice, and soak it in water for a
  half hour, then drain. Add 4 cups fresh water and salt, and bring to
  a boil. Cook, covered, at a simmer until the grains are swollen and
  tender, but still chewy, about 30 to 35 minutes. Pour the cooked rice
  into a colander and let it drain briefly. While the rice is cooking,
  toast the hazelnuts in the oven, 7 to 10 minutes, or until they smell
  toasty. Let them cool a few minutes; then rub them in a small kitchen
  towel to remove most of the skins. Don't worry about any flecks of
  skins that won't come off. Roughly chop the hazelnuts, leaving the
  pieces fairly large. Rinse the currants in warm water and squeeze
  them dry; then cover them with the orange juice and let them soak
  until needed. Prepare the vinaigrette. Add the soaked currants and
  the fennel to the warm rice, and toss with the dressing. Just before
  serving, cut the apple into small pieces, add it to the rice, along
  with the hazelnuts, and toss. Season with freshly ground black
  pepper, and additional salt, if needed, and serve.
