 Categories: fat free, vegan
      Yield: 1

    1/3 c  balsamic vinegar
    1/4 c  vinegar, apple cider
    1/4 c  water
      1 tb dijon mustard
      2    clove garlic; minced fresh
    1/2 ts apple juice concentrate; see
           - directions for sub
      1    sprigs parsley; minced fresh
      1 ts honey; this adds 
           -'clingability

Optional 1-2 Tbs. orange juice  optional: can be substituted for the apple
juice concentrate

Simply mix or blend together.  As with most things containing raw
garlic, the longer it keeps, the stronger the garlic.
( I find this goes well with greens and fruit and advacado and onions.)

 Categories: fat free, dressings
      Yield: 1

      6    cloves garlic; 4 to 8 
           -pressed
      2 ts red wine vinegar
      4 ts balsamic vinegar
      2 tb fresh lemon juice

    1/4 ts cayenne/hot sauce (optional)
      2 ts soy sauce/tamari
    1/2 c  hot water
      2 ts chicken-flavoured broth

    1/8 ts salt, or salt-free seasoning
           fresh cracked pepper

Mix, bottle and keep refrigerated.

I love this salad dressing over a combo of red leaf lettuce, watercress,
Belgian endive and radicchio, with a little shredded carrot, sliced red
onion and lots of chunked, fresh tomato.  It's definitely a 'toss-with'
rather than a 'place-on-the-table' dressing.  A cheesy, garlicky dressing
that lends itself well to assertive greens.  ~Jacqueline

      Title: Cucumber Dressing
 Categories: fat free, dressings, fat free dressings
      Yield: 1

  1 1/2 c  nonfat cottage cheese
      1    tomato, peeled and seeded; 
           -chopped
      1 md cucumber; chopped with or

      2 tb capers
    1/4    c. lemon juice
           pinch of black pepper
      1 md cucumber

A couple of ideas to use your cucumbers (and other stuff from the garden):
When I was young, my mom used to make a lowfat salad dressing with produce
from the garden:

Place all ingredients in an osterizor and blend til smooth.   You can also
add fresh chopped dill or parsley.
Saw a recipe for cucumber sauce on the list today; if you don't eat milk,
this is an alternative.  I made it the other night for falafels (baked of
course) and it was fine:

Combine tofu, capers, lemon juice and pepper and whirl in blender until
smooth

Grate 1 medium cucumber (no, you don't need to remove seeds) and squeeze
out
the excess liquid.   Stir into the tofu mixture.  Add a small amount of
chopped fresh mint if available.  Let stand for a while so the flavors
blend.

I buy the following salad at a local health food store restaurant.  I do
not
know any of the ingredients for the dressing, it just says Miso dressin &
then lists the salad ingredients.  I have a miso-vinegar dressing recipe I
will include.  I'm sure you can use other dressings (maybe the one above),
the ingredients are different and good.

      Title: Fatfree Basil Vinegar Dressing
 Categories: fat free, dressings
      Yield: 1

      1    bottle (12 oz) vinegar (i 
           -use white wine)
      1 tb peppercorns
      1 tb mustard seed
      1    red jalapeno chili; can be 
           -green, looks nice
      2    sprigs fresh basil
      4    cloves of garlic; 2 to 4
           salt or light soy sauce

Remove some of the vinegar from the bottle.  Put the pepper, mustard seed
and garlic into the bottle. Stuff in the basil in stem first (so it looks
vaguely like it is growing from the pepper and mustard seed)and top with
red pepper.  Flavor imporves in a couple days but good right away.  If you
remove the lable from the bottle it looks nice too.

BTW cut the garlic and pepper into strips so they will fit easily in the
bottle.

I use this and a very light soy sauce for salads at home.  For the
bottle that fits in my purse I some times add salt so I do not have to
fool with it later.

      1 ts good red wine vinegar
      2 ts balsamic vinegar
      1    tbls. lemon; preferbly fresh
      1 ts water
    1/2 ts dry mustard
      2 dr hot pepper sauce

Mix or blend all ingredients together.


When I eat out, I always order their lowfat  salad dressing on the
side  and either vinegar or lemon.  Then I mix about 1-2 tsp of the
lowfat dressing with the straight vinegar or lemon.  This adds lots of
flavor and additional 'cling' with just a little bit of fat.

 Categories: fat free, dressings
      Yield: 1

      1 tb cider vinegar
      2 tb spicy mustard

    1/4 c  mayo; use fatfree
    1/4 c  honey
    3/4 c  yogurt; use fatfree)
    1/8 ts ground pepper, red or black

If you decided to make this, I would advise you use 2 teaspoons of dry
mustard, not 2 tablespoons.  It had to be a typo because it was pure FIRE
with the 2 tablespoons.  I added more of the other ingredients to dilute
the
mustard and we'll be eating honey mustard dressing for a long time, but
that's o.k. because it is delicious.

    1/2 ts french mustard
           pinch garlic salt
           frashly ground black pepper

Whisk all ingredients together. Use as a dressing for salads and for
steamed vegetables.

Here is my favorite all-purpose dipping sauce that I use for
artichokes and various other veggies. It can also be used as a salad
dressing.
Do shop around and taste the various seasoned rice vinegars available out
there to find your favorite. It is a really mild vinegar though and can be
used a lot for fatfree dressings and sauces. For this recipe, I sometimes
add
dried or fresh basil.keeps in the refrigerator
for 2 to 3 weeks.
Place all ingredients in a bowl, and mix thoroughly.  Keep in the fridge
and use within 2 days.

      Title: Shallot Dressing
 Categories: 
      Yield: 1

    2/3 c  water
      1 ts arrowroot
      1 tb dijon mustard
    1/4 c  finely slivered shallots
    1/4 c  sherry vinegar

In a 1- to 1 1/2-quart pan, blend H2O smoothly with arrowroot.  Bring to a
boil, stirring.  Chill (quickly, by setting pan in ice water) and add
mustard,
shallots, and vinegar.  Use, or cover and chill up until next day.  Makes
about 1 cup.

This is easy to adapt to your tastes, adding whatever seasonings you
want to what is really only just thick water.  One warning, be careful
with the arrowroot.  It thickens just as it comes to the boil but I
found it must be cooked a bit or the dressing will taste starchy.  I
think that also results from using too much arrowroot.  A general
rule:

for 1 Cup H2O
1/2  tablespoon  arrowroot  = thin sauce
1  tablespoon                      = medium
3/2 - 2  tablespoon              = thick  (be careful, too much = ick

Make the yogurt cheese by draining yogurt in cheesecloth until it's thick
enough to call cheese.  Mix with other ingredients + refrigerate.  Be sure
to use only yogurt that doesn't contain gelatin because yogurt cheese
doesn't work as well when  the yogurt contains gelatin.
