Basic Salad Dressing II

salads, low cal, dressings

2 tablespoon red wine vinegar
2 tablespoon acceptable vegetable oil
4 tablespoon water
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice

In  jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine all ingredients.  Shake
well and refrigerate.  Makes 1/2 cup.  (Half of published recipe.) My
note: I frequently use bottled lemon juice which has sodium listed,
but there can't be much sodium in 1/2 tsp. divided among 8 servings.
If you use fresh lemon juice, extra can be frozen in an ice cube tray
or small container.

Grilled Salmon With Potato & Watercress Salad

fish, salads, pot. salad, low fat, grill

3 lb small red thin-skinned
1  potatoes
1 cup thinly sliced red onion
1 cup seasoned rice vinegar
1  about 1/2 pound watercress
1  rinsed and crisped
1  salmon fillet, about 2 lbs.
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon firmly packed brown sugar
2 cup alder or mesquite wood chips
1  soaked in water
1  salt

In a 5-to 6-quart pan, bring about 2 quarts water to a boil over high heat;
add potatoes.  Cover and simmer over low heat until potatoes are tender
when pierced, 15 to 20 minutes.  Drain and chill.

Soak the onions about 15 minutes in cold water to cover.  Drain and mix
onions with rice vinegar.  Cut potatoes in quarters; add to onions.

Trim tender watercress sprigs from stems, then finely chop enough of the
course stems to make 1/2 cup (discard extras or save for other uses).  Mix
chopped stems on a large oval platter with potato salad  alongside; cover
and keep cool.

Rinse salmon and pat dry.  Place, skin side down, on a piece of heavy foil.
Cut foil to follow outlines of fish, leaving a 1-inch border. Crimp edges
of foil to fit up against edge of fish.  Mix soy sauce with brown sugar and
brush onto the salmon fillet.

Lay fish on center of grill, not over coals or flame.  Cover barbecue (open
vents for charcoal) and cook until fish is barely opaque in thickest part
(cut to test),  15 to 20 minutes.  Transfer fish to platter with salad. Add
salt to taste.  Serve hot or cold.

Grilled Salmon With Potato And Watercress Salad

fish, salads, pot. salad, low fat, grill

3 lb small red thin-skinned
1  potatoes
1 cup thinly sliced red onion
1 cup seasoned rice vinegar
1  about 1/2 pound watercress
1  rinsed and crisped
1  salmon fillet, about 2 lbs.
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon firmly packed brown sugar
2 cup alder or mesquite wood chips
1  soaked in water
1  salt

In a 5-to 6-quart pan, bring about 2 quarts water to a boil over high heat;
add potatoes.  Cover and simmer over low heat until potatoes are tender
when pierced, 15 to 20 minutes.  Drain and chill.

Soak the onions about 15 minutes in cold water to cover.  Drain and mix
onions with rice vinegar.  Cut potatoes in quarters; add to onions.

Trim tender watercress sprigs from stems, then finely chop enough of the
course stems to make 1/2 cup (discard extras or save for other uses).  Mix
chopped stems on a large oval platter with potato salad  alongside; cover
and keep cool.

Rinse salmon and pat dry.  Place, skin side down, on a piece of heavy
foil.  Cut foil to follow outlines of fish, leaving a 1-inch border.
Crimp edges of foil to fit up against edge of fish.  Mix soy sauce with
brown sugar and brush onto the salmon fillet.

Lay fish on center of grill, not over coals or flame.  Cover barbecue
(open vents for charcoal) and cook until fish is barely opaque in thickest
part (cut to test),  15 to 20 minutes.  Transfer fish to platter with
salad.  Add salt to taste.  Serve hot or cold.

Low-Fat Beans And Rice From Mark Gulbranson

salads, low fat

1  brown or white rice
1  canned black beans
1  salsa, mild or medium

Cook the rice (as you wish with amounts) in water according to
directions with no seasoning (butter, salt, etc). Rinse the beans in
a colander. mix the beans with the rice. I use about 1/2 of a can of
beans to 4 cups of cooked rice. Mix enough salsa with the rice and
beans to make it colorful. Serve over lettuce or alone. This recipe
leaves a lot of leeway to add amounts to suit your tastes. The kids
love it and it adds a nice touch to BBQ meals. Good way to use left
over rice instead of turning it into fattening rice pudding. Make
pleanty...it goes FAST! Make sure the beans are well rinsed otherwise
that nasty looking black liquid will spoil the appearance. It's a
personal favorite of mine.

Nonfat Scalloped Potatoes

low fat, side dish

2  potatoes; well scrubbed
1 large onion (yellow)
1 1/2 cup evaporated skim milk, approx (or am; azake)
1  freshly ground black pepper
1  basil
1  rosemary
1  paprika

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Thinly slice the potatoes (leaving
skins on) and the onion.  Spray a glass baking dish with non-stick
spray. Layer the pan alternately with the potato and onion slices.
Just before the last layer, sprinkle on 1-3 tsp each of the pepper,
basil, and rosemary. Add the last layer of potatoes and onions.  Pour
the evap skimmed milk (or amazake) over top. You should have enough
liquid to almost cover the mixture. Sprinkle on some paprika.  Cover
with foil and bake for about an hour or until the liquid is all
absorbed. Remove foil for the last 15-20 minutes to crisp it a bit.

I guessed at the measurements for this dish, as I just sort of slap it
together without measuring.  Check it to see if it will be done early
or take a little extra time.  It's a very forgiving dish.  My only
complaint is that it doesn't freeze-and-reheat well (because of the
cooked potatoes).

Plum Tomato Tart

appetizers, low cal, tomato, filo dough

1 large egg white
3 tablespoon olive oil
6  phyllo dough sheets (14x18)
5 teaspoon breadcrumbs; dry
1/3 cup dijon mustard
1/4 cup parmesan cheese; freshly -grated
1 lb plum tomatoes (about 8)
2 tablespoon parsley; fresh (chopped)
1 teaspoon thyme; fresh, or 1/2 t drie

Set oven rack on the upper level; preheat to 400 degrees F.
Lightly coat a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray or line with
parchment paper In a small bowl, whisk together the egg white and 2
Tbsp. olive oil.
Lay a sheet of phyllo on the prepared baking sheet, and with a
pastry brush, lightly coat the surface with the egg-white mixture.
Sprinkle with 1 tsp. breadcrumbs. Repeat this step, layering 4 more
sheets of phyllo on top and brush with egg-white mixture. To form an
edge to the tart, carefully roll over the edges toward the center,
using the blade of a knife to help you get started.
With a rubber spatula, spread mustard over the surface of the
dough and sprinkle with cheese. (The tart can be prepared ahead to
this point. Wrap and freeze for up to 2 months. Do not thaw before
continuing.) Arrange tomato slices on top in 5 rows of 8 slices each.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown. Let
cool in the pan for 5 minutes. In a small bowl, combine the remaining
1 Tbsp. olive oil, parsley, garlic and thyme. With your fingers or a
fork, dab some of the herb mixture onto each tomato slice. Slide the
tart onto a serving platter or, if you wish to serve bite-sized
appetizers, slide it onto a cutting board and with a sharp knife or
pizza cutter, cut the tart into squares between the tomato slices.
Serve warm or at room temperature.

2 tablespoon poppy seeds
2 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 large egg white
2 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
6  phyllo dough sheets (14x18

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly coat 2 baking sheets with
nonstick cooking spray or line with parchment paper. Heat a small
heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the poppy and sesame seeds and
cook, stirring until they are aromatic and toasted, 2 to 3 minutes.
Turn out onto a plate to cool. In a small bowl, whisk together egg
white, oil and salt.
Lay a sheet of phyllo on a work surface with a short side toward
you. With a pastry brush, lightly coat the lower half of the sheet
with the egg-white mixture and sprinkle with 1 tsp. seeds. Fold the
upper half over to cover the lower half. Brush the right half of the
folded sheet with egg-white mixture, sprinkle with 1/4 tsp. seeds and
fold the left half over the seeds. Brush the bottom half of the
folded sheet with the egg-white mixture, sprinkle with 1/4 tsp. seeds
and fold the upper half over. Finally, brush the top with the

strips using a knife or serrated pastry cutter. With a wide spatula,
transfer the strips to the baking sheet, placing them about 1/2 inch
apart. Repeat the procedure with the remaining 5 sheets of phyllo,
egg-white mixture and seeds. Bake the straws for 8 to 10 minutes,
until golden and crisp. Transfer to a rack to cool.
The straws may be stored in an airtight container at room
temperature for 1 week or in the freezer for up to 2 months.

egg white, oil and salt. Lay one sheet of phyllo on a work surface
with a short side toward you. Brush lower half of the sheet with the
egg-white mixture. Repeat this step with a second sheet of phyllo and
set on top of the first. Spoon one-quarter of the spinach filling
along one long edge. Tuck in the side edges and roll up, jelly-roll
fashion. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the
remaining phyllo, egg-white mixture and filling, making 4 rolls in
all. Brush tops of the rolls lightly with the egg-mixture and
sprinkle with seeds, if desired. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes. With a
serrated knife, cut each roll diagonally into 9 pieces and serve hot.

The rolls may be prepared, baked and sliced up to 2 days in advance.
Reheat in a 350 degree F oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until heated
through. Makes 36 appetizers.

**"Inspired by the Greek appetizer spanakopitakia, these rolls are
easy to make for a crowd."
