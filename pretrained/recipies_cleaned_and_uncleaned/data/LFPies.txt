TO MAKE CRUST:

1. Lightly oil a 9-inch pie pan or coat it with nonstick cooking spray. In a medium bowl, stir together flour, sugar and salt. In a small saucepan, melt butter over low heat. Cook, swirling the pan, until the butter turns a nutty brown, about 30 seconds. Pour into a small bowl and let cool. Stir in oil. Using a fork, slowly stir the butter/oil mixture into the dry ingredients until the mixture is crumbly. Gradually stir in enough cold water (1 to 2 tablespoons) so that the dough holds together easily. Press the dough into a flattened disk.

2. Place two overlapping sheets of plastic wrap on the work surface. Set the dough in the center and cover with two more sheets of plastic wrap. With a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 12-inch circle. Remove the top sheets and invert the dough into the prepared pie pan. Gently press the dough into the bottom of the pan. Remove the remaining plastic wrap. Fold the edges under and crimp. Preheat oven to 3500E Place rack in lower third of oven.

TO MAKE STREUSEL TOPPING:

In a bowl, combine 1/2 cup of the oats, flour, brown sugar and cinnamon. Add oil and lemon juice and work in with your fingertips until small crumbs form. Set aside.

TO MAKE FILLING & ASSEMBLE PIE:

1. In a small bowl, stir together sugar and flour. In a mixing bowl, toss apples and cranberries with lemon zest and juice. Sprinkle the sugar mixture over the apples and toss well. Pile the filling in the pie shell.

2. Spread the reserved streusel topping evenly over the apples and sprinkle the remaining tablespoon of oats over the top. Set the pie on a baking sheet to catch any drips.

3. Bake for 55 to 65 minutes, or until the fruit is bubbling at the edges and is easily pierced with a skewer in the center. Check the pie toward the end of the baking time; if the crust or the topping is becoming too dark, cover the pie loosely with foil.

Makes one 9-inch pie, for 8 servings.

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***CRUST***
   1      large         egg
   2      teaspoons     fresh lemon juice
     1/2  cup           low-fat cottage cheese
     1/3  cup           canola oil
   2      tablespoons   granulated sugar
   1      teaspoon      pure vanilla extract
     1/2  teaspoon      salt
   2      cups          all-purpose flour
   2      tablespoons   cold butter -- cut into 4 pieces
                        ***FILLING & GLAZE***
   5      cups          sour cherries -- pitted
                        --about 2 pounds
     3/4  cup           granulated sugar -- plus 2 teaspoons
   3      tablespoons   cornstarch
   2      tablespoons   fresh lemon juice
     1/4  teaspoon      pure almond extract
   1      tablespoon    low-fat milk

TO MAKE CRUST: 1. In a glass measuring cup, blend egg and lemon juice with a fork.

2. In a food processor, combine cottage cheese, oil, sugar, vanilla and salt; process until smooth and creamy, stopping once to scrape down the sides of the workbowl. Add flour and butter; pulse about 6 times, just until butter is in pea-size pieces. Add egg mixture and pulse just until dough begins to clump together. (Do not let it form a ball.) Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into 2 pieces, one slightly larger than the other. Form each piece into a disc, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes and up to 2 days.

3. Lightly oil a 9-inch pie pan or coat it with nonstick spray. On a lightly floured surface, roll the larger piece of dough into a 12-inch circle. Roll dough over rolling pin, then unroll into prepared pan. Gently press dough into bottom and sides of pan. With scissors, trim excess pastry, leaving a 3/4-inch overhang. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed.

4. On a lightly floured surface, roll the smaller piece of dough into an 11-inch circle. Roll dough over rolling pin, then unroll onto a sheet of parchment or wax paper. Using a pastry wheel, preferably serrated, or a sharp knife, cut dough into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Carefully transfer paper to a baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed.

TO MAKE FILLING & BAKE PIE:

1. Position oven rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 425°F.

2. In a large bowl, toss cherries with 3/4 cup sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice and almond extract. Spoon into crust.

3. Weave pastry strips about 1/2 inch apart to form a lattice over the filling. Trim strips at edge of pie pan. Turn overhanging pastry up over rim; press to seal and decoratively flute edges. Brush milk over lattice top and sprinkle with remaining 2 teaspoons sugar.

4. Set pie on a baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. Cover edges of crust with aluminum foil to prevent over-browning. Reduce oven temperature to 375° and bake for 40 to 50 minutes longer, or until crust is golden and juices are bubbling. Cool on a wire rack.

   1 1/2  teaspoons     pure vanilla extract
   3      large         egg whites
     1/2  teaspoon      cream of tartar
                        chocolate curls -- optional

TO MAKE CRUST:

1. Preheat oven to 325°F. Lightly oil a 9-inch pie pan or coat it with nonstick spray.

2. In a food processor, combine chocolate wafers and dates. Process until finely chopped. Add oil and water and process until moistened. Press into the bottom and sides of prepared pan.

3. Bake crust for 10 minutes, or until crisp. Cool completely on a wire rack.

TO MAKE FILLING & SERVE:

1. In a small bowl, combine coffee and 1 tablespoon water. Sprinkle gelatin on top and set aside to soften.

2. In a small saucepan, whisk egg, milk, 3 tablespoons brown sugar and cocoa until smooth. Cook over low heat, whisking constantly, until thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. Do not let mixture come to a simmer.

3. Remove from heat, add reserved gelatin mixture and stir until dissolved. Add chocolate and vanilla, stirring until melted. Set aside to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.

4. Meanwhile, in a wide saucepan, bring about 1 inch water to a bare simmer over low heat. In a heatproof bowl large enough to fit over the saucepan, combine egg whites, cream of tartar, remaining 3 tablespoons water and remaining 5 tablespoons brown sugar. Set bowl over the saucepan; beat with an electric mixer at low speed until an instant-read thermometer registers 140°F, about 3 to 5 minutes.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***CRUST***
  30                    gingersnaps
                        --7 1/2 ounces
   2      tablespoons   raisins
   1      tablespoon    canola oil
                        ***FILLING***
   6      tablespoons   water
                        yellow food coloring -- optional
   1 1/2  teaspoons     unflavored gelatin
   2      large         eggs
     1/4  cup           granulated sugar -- plus 2/3 cup
     1/2  cup           fresh lemon juice
   1      tablespoon    freshly grated lemon zest
   3      large         egg whites
     1/4  teaspoon      cream of tartar
     1/4  cup           whipping cream
                        candied lemon zest

TO MAKE CRUST:

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly oil a 9-inch pie pan or coat it with nonstick spray.

2. In a food processor, pulse gingersnaps and raisins until finely chopped. Add oil and process until well combined. Press evenly over bottom and sides of prepared pan.

3. Bake crust for 10 minutes, or until set. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

TO MAKE FILLING:

1. In a small bowl, place 3 tablespoons water and about 3 drops food coloring, if using. Sprinkle gelatin over water. Set aside.

2. In a wide pan, bring about 1 inch of water to a simmer. Adjust heat so water is at a bare simmer. In a large heatproof mixing bowl that can sit on the pan, combine whole eggs, 1/4 cup sugar, lemon juice and lemon zest. Set the bowl over the pan and whisk constantly until mixture thickens and an instant-read thermometer registers 160°F. Whisk in reserved gelatin mixture. Remove from heat and let cool for 20 minutes, whisking occasionally.

3. In another heatproof bowl that can sit on the pan, combine egg whites, cream of tartar, the remaining 2/3 cup sugar and the remaining 3 tablespoons water. Set the bowl over the pan; beat with an electric mixer at low speed until an instant-read thermometer registers 140°F, 3 to 5 minutes.

4. Increase mixer speed to high and beat for a full 3 1/2 minutes. Remove from heat and beat until almost cool, about 2 minutes more.

5. In a chilled bowl, whip cream until soft peaks form.

6. Whisk about one-fourth of the meringue into the lemon mixture. Gently whisk in remaining meringue. With a rubber spatula, fold in cream. Spoon into prepared pie shell and chill, loosely covered, until set, about 3 hours. (The pie will keep, covrerd, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.)

7. Just before serving, decorate pie with Candled Lemon Zest.

   3      tablespoons   fresh lemon juice
     3/4  cup           water
     2/3  cup           granulated sugar
   1      tablespoon    butter

1. Preheat oven to 375°F. 2. Place 2 overlapping sheets of plastic wrap on a work surface. Set dough in the center and cover with 2 more sheets of plastic wrap. Roll dough into a l0-inch circle. Transfer dough (still between plastic) to a baking sheet and freeze until ready to use. 3. Peel pears, cut in half lengthwise and core. In a bowl, toss with 1 tablespoon lemon juice; set aside. 4. In a heavy 10-inch ovenproof skillet, combine 1/4 cup water and sugar. Over low heat, swirl until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium and bring sugar syrup to a simmer. Cover and simmer for 1 minute. Uncover and cook, without stirring, until syrup turns light amber, 6 to 8 minutes. Gently swirl skillet if syrup is coloring unevenly. 5. Remove from heat and add remaining 1/2 cup water and 2 tablespoons lemon juice. (Stand back, as caramel may sputter.) Return skillet to low heat and stir until caramel has dissolved. Add butter and stir until melted. 6. Arrange pears cut-side down in the caramel in a tight circle, with 1 pear half in the center. Increase heat to medium. Cover and cook for 10 minutes. With tongs, turn pears cut-side up and increase heat to high. Cook, uncovered, until pears are tender and caramel becomes a thick glaze, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. 7. Remove pastry from freezer and peel off plastic wrap. Lay crust over pears, turning edges under to fit. (Let the steam from the pears warm the crust until pliable.) 8. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until crust is golden. Remove from oven. Place a large flat serving plate on top of the tart, quickly invert it and remove pan. Let cool for about 10 minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Increase heat to high, uncover and cook about 2 to 4 minutes, until juices have been reduced to a thick glaze. Remove from heat. Push apples to one side of skillet. Spoon out as much caramel as possible from skillet into prepared cake pan. Set apple wedges, rounded sides down, in circular pattern into the caramel.

4. Trim crusts from bread; cut each slice diagonally into 2 triangles. Arrange triangles over apples to form a single layer, cutting small pieces of bread as necessary to fill in gaps. In small bowl, stir together cider, oil and melted butter; brush lightly over bread.

5. Bake 25 minutes, until bread is crisp and golden brown. Cool tart in pan on wire rack about 10 minutes. Set a serving plate on top of tart and quickly invert. Reposition any apple pieces that stick to pan; drizzle any excess caramel over top. Serve warm.
