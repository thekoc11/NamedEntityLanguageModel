  the fall. Dice or slice fruit as needed for best looking presentation
  and easy serving.

      Title: BERRY COBBLER
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 pt Boysenberries
    1/2 pt Blueberries
    1/2 pt Raspberries
    1/3 c  Sugar
      1 tb -Flour, or up to:
  1 1/2 tb Flour

MMMMM-----------------------COBBLER DOUGH----------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Flour
    3/8 ts Salt
  1 1/2 tb Sugar
  2 1/4 ts Baking powder
      6 tb Unsalted butter
    3/4 c  Whipping cream
 
  You may use a mixture of any berries available to you ~- except
  strawberries.  Blackberries or boysenberries are nice for the bulk; a
  few raspberries add a delicious perfume. Measure 4 1/2 cups of mixed
  berries and toss them with the sugar and flour. Use the larger amount
  of flour if the berries are very juicy.  Let stand while you make the
  dough. Mix the dry ingredients for the dough, leaving out the salt if
  you are using salted butter.  Cut in the butter until the mixture
  looks like coarse cornmeal. Add the cream and mix lightly, until the
  dry ingredients are just moistened.  The dry ingredients for the
  topping can be prepared ahead -- even several days ahead -- and kept
  refrigerated. The cream can then be added when you are ready to bake
  the cobbler. Put the berry mixture into a 1-1/2 quart gratin or
  baking dish.  Make patties of the dough, 2 to 2-1/2 inches in
  diameter and 1/2-inch thick. Arrange them over the top of the
  berries.  Bake in a preheated 375 F oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or
  until the topping is brown and the berry juices bubble thickly around
  it. Serve warm with cream to pour over it. People who don't
  ordinarily like dessert will often eat this.

      Title: BERT GREENE'S YOGURT CAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
  2 1/2 c  Sifted cake flour
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Salt
      8 oz Unsalted butter, room
           -temperature
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      4    Eggs, room temperature
      2 oz Unblanched almonds, ground
      2 ts Finely grated zest of 1
           -lemon
      8 oz Plain low-fat yogurt, room
           -temperature
 
  This recipe illustrates a helpful feature: ingredients listed with
  weights. It's easy to go to the supermarket and buy 8 ounces of
  yogurt and 2 ounces of almonds, but try eyeballing 2 cups yogurt or
  1/3 cup almonds.
  
  Adjust rack in lower third of oven; preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan or a 12-cup Bundt (decorative)
  tube pan.
  
  Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt onto a sheet of
  waxed paper.
  
  Place the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer (or in a large
  mixing bowl). Using an electric mixer, preferably fitted with a
  paddle attachment, cream the butter on medium speed until it is
  lighter in color and has a satiny appearance. Maintaining the same
  speed, add the sugar and continue to cream until the mixture is very
  light in color and fluffy in appearance.
  
  Add the eggs, 1 at a time. Continue to cream, stopping the mixer and
  scraping the sides of the bowl at least once. When the mixture appears
  fluffy, light in color and velvety, and has increased in volume,
  detach the paddle and bowl. Stir in the ground almonds and lemon zest
  with a rubber spatula.
  
  Using the rubber spatula, stir in 1/3 of the flour mixture. Then add
  half of the yogurt, stirring to blend. Repeat, alternating dry and
  liquid ingredients, ending with a final addition of flour. Scrape the
  sides of the bowl often, and mix until smooth after each addition.
  Spoon the batter into the prepared pan and level it.
  
  Bake 45 to 50 minutes or until the cake springs back slightly when
  touched lightly in the center the sides begin to contract from the
  pan and a wooden toothpick inserted in the center. comes out free of
  cake. Place the cake on a rack to cool for 10 minutes.
  
  Cover the cake with a cooling rack, and invert it onto the rack.
  Carefully lift off the pan. Cool completely before serving.
  
  If you plan to use this cake within 24 hours, wrap it in plastic wrap
  and store at room temperature. To freeze, cover the plastic wrapped
  package with foil.

      Title: BERT'S SUPERB BARBECUE SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Cider Vinegar
    1/2 c  Water
      2 tb Sugar
      1 tb Prepared Mustard
    1/4 c  Butter or Margarine
      1    Thick lemon Slice
      1    Onion; sliced
    1/2 ts Pepper
  1 1/2 tb Salt
    1/4 ts Cayenne Pepper
    3/4 c  Heinz catsup
      2 tb Worcestershire sauce
 
  In a saucepan, mix vinegar, water, sugar, mustard, butter, lemon,
  onion, and seasonings. Simmer, uncovered, 20 minutes. Add
  worcestershire sauce and catsup, bring back to a boil and its done.
  (Good Housekeeping CB, 1955) NOTE: I do not use cayenne or salt and
  always double this recipe. Into the double recipe, I add about 1/4 to
  1/3 cup brown sugar. This gives the sauce more of a sweet and sour
  taste. It is just excellent on Baby Back Ribs, which I simmer in
  water with a little vinegar, garlic and just a pinch of salt for
  about 30 minutes before barbequeing. Through trial and error, I have
  found that Heinz catchup is thicker and makes a "clingier" sauce.

      Yield: 144 Servings
 
      6 oz Chick pea flour; 1 1/4 c
           -180 g. also called besan
           -or Gram flour
      1 c  Vegetable oil; 8 fl oz.
     14 oz Sugar; 1 1/2 c or 395 g
    1/2 ts Cardamom seeds; ground
      2 tb Pistachios; unsalted
           -up to 3 tbsp
           -lightly crushed
      1 tb Almonds, blanched;coarsely
           -chopped
           - up to 2 tbsp
 
  Anne's note: The original recipe measures the dry ingredients by
  weight; these are the most accurate measures (I converted it to
  volume measures).
  
  Sift the chick pea flour. Heat oil in a heavy, 10-12" frying pan, wok
  or saute pan over a medium flame. Put in the sifted chick pea flour.
  Stir and fry 2 to 3 minutes until the flour turns a shade darker and
  is cooked (it should taste fried, not raw). Put the flour into a
  large bowl, stir at once and allow to cool.
  
  Make a syrup with 1 cup/8 fl oz/1/4 litre water and the 14 oz/1 1/3
  c/395 g. sugar by bringing the water-sugar combination to a boil and
  then simmering very gently for about 20 minutes or until the syrup
  reaches a one thread consistency. (To test this, dip in a wooden
  spoon and let coat slightly. Pinch some syrup off the back of the
  spoon with two fingers and then try separating the fingers. One
  sticky thread should form. This is the Indian method. If you have a
  better one, use it.)
  
  Pour the hot syrup in the cooled chick pea flour/gram flour mixture.
  add the ground cardamom seeds and the nuts and mix well. keep
  stirring until mixture begins to harden slightly. (It should still be
  pourable.) Pour into a 9 inch square cake tin, tilt tin so barfee
  mixture flows to the edges and allow to cool. Cut into 3/4 inch
  cubes. besan barfee if tightly wrapped in aluminium foil and then
  placed in a plastic container, freezes very well.

 Categories: Side dish, Indian, Vegetables, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Chickpea flour
      1 lg Tomato
    1/4 c  Green peas
      1 lg Potato
      1 lg Onion
    1/4 lb Ginger
    1/2 ts Garlic powder
    1/4 ts Mustard powder
    1/4 ts Cumin
    1/4 ts Coriander
      1 ts Turmeric
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
 
  Mix chickpea flour with a little bit of water at a time, until you
  have a thick batter.  Add salt and garlic powder.
  
  Put a skillet over a low heat and heat oil.  Drop 1/2 teaspoon of
  batter at a time into the oil.  When it turns golden brown, it it
  done and with a srainer pick up the besan and put it on a dry pan.
  
  Cut potatoes in small pieces and put them in a bowl. Chop onion up and
  saute with 1 tablespoon of leftover oil. Add coriander, cumin,
  turmeric, and mustard powders.
  
  Add potatoes and mix thoroughly.  Add 1/4 cup of water.
  
  Cut ginger into very small pieces and add to the curry.
  
  While the curry is cooking, cut the tomato and add to the pan. Put
  cover on.
  
  When potato feels soft, add fried besan to the curry. Add salt.
  
  The time you drop the potato in the pan to the time you drop the fried
  besan into the pan should not be more then 15 minutes. As always, in
  Indian cooking it is the preparation that takes time, not the cooking
  itself.
  
  Serve warm as a side dish.

      Title: BEST CRANBERRY MUFFINS
 Categories: Dorcas, Breads
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Butter
  1 1/2 c  Unsifted flour
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 lg Egg
    1/2 c  Milk
      1 c  Fresh cranberries
      2 tb Sugar
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
 
   Stir flour to aerate.  Mix the 2 tablespoons sugar with cinnamon.
  Coarsely chop cranberries with knife.
  
   Generously butter a 12 cup muffin pan.
  
   In a small saucepan or skillet, melt butter; set aside to cool.
  
   In a medium mixing bowl, with a fork, thoroughly stir together the
  flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.
  
   In a small mixing bowl beat egg enough to combine yolk and white;
  beat in milk and melted butter.  Add to flour mixture; stir quickly
  and lightly just until flour is almost dampened. Add cranberries;
  lightly stir in; do not beat.
  
   Using a large metal spoon, spoon batter into prepared muffin-pan
  cups, filling each slightly more than half full. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon
  cinnamon-sugar over batter in each cup.
  
   Bake in a preheated 375~ oven until golden brown and a cake tester
  inserted in the center comes out clean - 20 to 25 minutes.
  
   If muffins are to be held 10 to 15 minutes before serving, tip them
  in the pan to prevent steaming and keep in a warm oven. To reheat
  cold muffins, place them in a covered pan or a closed paper bag in a
  preheated 350~ oven for 10 minutes.

      Title: BEST EVER BAKED BEANS
 Categories: None
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      5 lb Pork and beans - canned
           -(actually 4 to 5 lbs.)
    1/2 c  Onion - chopped
    1/2 c  Celery - chopped
    1/3 c  Bell pepper - chopped
      2 tb Mustard - prepared
    1/2 c  Molasses
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
      3    Drops Tabasco - actually 3
           -to 4 drops
    1/2 c  Barbecue sauce - bottled or
           -homemade (see recipe)
    1/2 c  Catsup
      2    Strip bacon - uncooked and
           -cut in half
 
  Combine all ingredients, except in bacon, in large ovenproof
  container. Lay bacon strips on top.  Place on smoker grid and smoke
  for 2 to 2-1/2 hours.
  
  Note from me:  If you don't have a smoker, you can cook at about 350F
  for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the bacon is curling. Better
  flavor in a smoker, but divine beans without!
  
  Makes 8 to 10 servings.
  
  Recipe from "Cook'n Cajun Water Smoker Cookbook" by Sondra Hester.
  
  This is undoubtedly one of the best baked bean dishes we've ever
  tasted. Easy to make and no tending necessary. You can have ribs
  smoking on the bottom rack and beans on the top rack. Add garlic
  bread and coleslaw, potato salad or macaroni salad and you've got a
  Super Bowl party, bowl game or Monday Night Football dinner! Source:

      Title: BEST EVER CINNAMON ROLLS (RAISIN PECAN CINNAM
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  4 1/2 c  Flour
      1 pk Dry yeast
      1 c  Milk
    1/3 c  Butter
    1/3 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      3    Eggs
    3/4 c  Packed brown sugar
    1/4 c  Flour
      1 tb Ground cinnamon
    1/2 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Light raisins
    1/2 c  Chopped pecans
      1 tb Half-and-half or light cream
           Powdered Sugar Glaze
 
  In a large mixer bowl, combine 2 1/4 cups of the flour and the yeast.
  In a small saucepan heat the milk, the 1/3 cup butter, the 1/3 cup
  sugar, and salt just till warm (120 degrees to 130 degrees) and
  butter is almost melted, stirring constantly.  Add to flour mixture.
  Add eggs. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds,
  scraping sides of bowl constantly.  Beat on high speed for 3 minutes.
  Using a wooden spoon, stir in as much of the remaining 2 1/4 to 2 3/4
  cups flour as you can. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.
  Knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a moderately soft
  dough that is smooth and elastic (3 to 5 minutes total).  Shape into
  a ball. Place in a greased bowl, turning once. Cover; let rise in a
  warm place till double (about 1 hour). For filling, combine brown
  sugar, the 1/4 cup flour, and cinnamon. Cut in remaining butter till
  crumbly; set aside. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured
  surface. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Roll the dough into a 12"
  square. Sprinkle filling over dough square; top with raisins and
  pecans. Roll up jelly-roll style; pinch edges to seal. Slice roll
  into eight 1 1/2" pieces. Arrange dough pieces, cut side up, in a
  greased 12" deep-dish pizza pan or a 13x9x2" baking pan. Cover dough
  loosely with clear plastic wrap, leaving room for rolls to rise.
  Refrigerate rolls 2 to 24 hours.  Uncover and let stand at room
  temperature for 30 minutes (Or, for immediate baking, don't chill
  dough. Instead, cover loosely; let dough rise in a warm place till
  nearly double, about 45 minutes). Break any surface bubbles with a
  greased toothpick. Brush dough with half-and-half or light cream.
  Bake in a 375 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes or till light brown.
  If necessary to prevent overbrowning, cover rolls loosely with foil
  the last 5 to 10 minutes of baking. Remove rolls from oven. Brush
  again with half-and-half or light cream. Cool for 1 minute. Carefully
  invert cinnamon rolls onto a wire rack. Cool slightly. Invert again
  onto a serving platter. Drizzle with Powdered Sugar Glaze. Serve
  warm. Makes 8 rolls. VARIATION: Apple Cinnamon Rolls: Prepare rolls
  as directed, except substitute 1 cup finely chopped apple for the
  raisins in the filling. POWDERED SUGAR GLAZE: In a bowl stir together
  1 1/4 cups sifted powdered sugar, 1 tsp. corn syrup, 1/2 tsp.
  vanilla, and enough half-and-half or light cream (1 to 2 Tbsp.) to
  make of drizzling consistency.

      Title: BEST EVER ORANGE SPONGE CAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      6    Egg whites (3/4 cup)
    1/4 ts Salt
      6 ts Orange juice; fresh
  1 3/4 c  All-purpose flour; sifted
  1 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      1 ts Orange peel; freshly grated
      6    Egg yolks
           Confectioners sugar
 
  Note: If desired, spray tube pan or kugelhopf pan with nonstick baking
  spray before filling with batter and baking. To cool, DO NOT invert on
  bottle. Instead place pan on wire rack to cool 30 minutes. Turn cake
  out onto wire rack and cool completely. In large bowl of electric
  mixer, let egg whites warm to room temperature, about 1 hour. Measure
  flour; sift about 2 cups flour once on a sheet of waxed paper; fill
  cups lightly to overflowing; with a spatula, cut off excess to make 1
  3/4 level cups. Sift flour with salt; set aside. With electric mixer
  at medium speed, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually, beat in 1/2
  cup of the granulated sugar, 2 tbsp at a time, beating well after
  each addition. Continue beating until stiff peaks form when beaters
  are slowly raised. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In small bowl of
  electric mixer, with the same beaters at high speed, beat egg yolks
  until very thick and lemon colored, about 3 minutes. DO NOT UNDER
  BEAT. Gradually, beat in remaining 1 cup granulated sugar; continue
  beating until mixture is smooth. At low speed, blend flour mixture
  and orange juice alternately into egg yolk mixture, beginning and
  ending with flour and guiding batter into beaters with scraper. Add
  orange peel. With whisk or rubber spatula, using under and over
  motion, fold yolk mixture gently into whites. Pour batter into an
  ungreased (see note 1) 9 3/4 to 10" x 4 1/2" kugelhopf pan or 10 x 4"
  tube pan without removable bottom. Bake 50 to 55 minutes until cake
  springs back when pressed with finger. Invert over bottle (see note
  1); cool completely. Using an up and down motion, run spatula around
  edge of cake and tube. Invert cake and shake to release; place on
  serving plate. Sift Confectioners sugar over top of cake. To cut
  cake, use knife with serrated edge. Cut gently, going back and forth
  with sawing motion.

 Categories: Breakfast
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
      1 tb Granulated sugar
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Buttermilk
           -OR
    3/4 c  Plain yogurt
           -PLUS
    1/4 c  Water
      1 lg Egg
      2 tb Mild olive or vegetable oil
           Oil for cooking
           Griddle, large skillet,
           -or waffle iron
 
  (From "Pancakes and Waffles" by Elizabeth Alston. HarperCollins;
  $12.50; 1993.)
  
  Food processor method: Put the flours, sugar, baking powder, baking
  soda, cinnamon and salt into a food processor. Process briefly to
  mix. Add the buttermilk, or yogurt and water, egg and oil. Turn the
  machine on-off (pulse) 3 or 4 times to make a smooth batter.
  
  By hand method: Put the flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda,
  cinnamon and salt into a large bowl. Stir to mix well.
  
  Measure the buttermilk in a 2-cup glass measure. Add the egg and oil
  to the measuring cup. Beat with a fork or wire whisk to blend. Add to
  the flour mixture and stir to form a smooth batter.
  
  For pancakes: Heat the griddle or skillet over moderately high heat
  until it feels hot when you hold your hand directly above it. Lightly
  grease the griddle. For each pancake, pour 1/4 cup batter onto the
  griddle. Cook 3-5 minutes, until bubbles appear on the surface and
  the undersides are golden brown. Adjust the heat if the pancakes are
  browning too fast. Turn the pancakes over and cook 1-2 minutes longer
  to brown the second side.
  
  For waffles: heat the waffle iron; grease it lightly. Pour in the
  appropriate amount of batter and spread to the edges. Close and cook
  until the iron will open easily.
  
  Keep finished waffles or pancakes warm in a 200'F. oven - pancakes on
  a plate and loosely covered to keep moist; waffles directly on the
  oven rack, uncovered, to stay crisp. Makes 8 4" pancakes. Serves 4.

    3/4 c  Mayonaise
  1 1/2 ts Yellow Mustard
     12    Eggs, hard boiled.
      1 c  Apple cider vinegar
  1 1/2 tb Pickle relish
    3/4 tb Dry parsley flakes
           Pinch of Celery Salt
    1/2 md White onion, diced
      4    Celery stalks, split
 
  Gather ingredients. The half cup of sprinkling vinegar should be just
  estimated from the bottle as you sprinkle. It's just a conservative
  guestimate and the exact amount will depend upon the amount of
  potatoes to sprinkle. Don't worry about it too much. Boil potatoes
  whole. If your potato size varies much, put in the larger ones first.
  A medium sized potato will take ABOUT 25 minutes total. A smaller one
  maybe 18 minutes. One of the keys here is to boil the potatoes till
  cooked but still a little firm. If they are cooked till soft, then
  the subsequent stirring will render the salad mushy. You don't want
  them crunchy, but just cooked and still firm. That's the first
  secret! Peel the potatoes when they are still warm. The warmer the
  better. Peeling them AFTER they are cooked seems to make a difference
  in taste. They MUST not cool entirely or the vinegar will not be
  absorbed properly. I peel them almost straight out of the pot when
  still darn hot. That's the second secret! Cut them into irregular
  chunks, little wedges about an inch or slightly less on a side with
  the greatest thickness about a half inch. Just cut a little off one
  end, then cut another small chunk off, then keep cutting pieces off
  in random sizes of varying shapes, mostly you end up with very
  irregular pyramidal shapes....You want pieces big enough to not turn
  into mush but small enough for ...your liking! The edges will
  eventually break off and mush up onto the salad while the larger
  parts of the bodies will remain whole. You are cutting, peeling and
  dropping them into a large bowl. There really should be two people
  doing this or one should work as quickly as possible. After you have
  cut up a potato or two, sprinkle them fairly generously vinegar and
  stir around a bit in the bowl..just a bit so you get the vinegar that
  fell to the bottom of the bowl on the potatoes. As you finish a
  potato or two, sprinkle each (they should be warm to hot when you
  sprinkle, if possible...THAT's the BIG secret to this recipe) fairly
  generously. I put my finger over the end of the bottle of cider
  vinegar and drizzly drip it onto the potatoes making sure each is
  sprinkled well. If you run out of the half cup, just use more. Each
  potato gets a fairly generous sprinkling of vinegar. THAT point is
  more important than the measurement of the 1/2 cup of vinegar above.
  Note: I don't measure out a half cup and then pour it on them. That
  would be awkward. I did measure this once out so I could have a
  recipe for a friend and I learned I sprinkled ABOUT a half a cup.
  Salt them at this point; I don't know how much....Just salt them like
  you like. The vinegar needs a comment. The importance of a generous
  sprinkling of vinegar while the potatoes are warm/hot can't be over
  emphasized. They will soak up the vinegar. I am always amazed at how
  much vinegar it takes and how when they are done, the vinegar is
  tasted, but the dish is not 'vinegary' like a hot German potato salad
  which I hate....trust in a good sprinkling of vinegar at this point
  and if in doubt, sprinkle a little more! Stir in the other
  ingredients, leaving the eggs to last. Chop up the eggs, slicing,
  cutting in whatever size/shape you wish but we are not talking about
  whole or half eggs here. Cut them up. The yolks will fall apart when
  sliced up and that's ok. Stir all the eggs into the rest of the mix.
  The yolks will incorporate into the salad and you don't have to worry
  about them; don't stir forever or worry about being gentle or
  anything. Just mix it up. Add the other 1/2 cup of vinegar. If you
  are a real chicken, you may wish to add only a 1/4 cup but it will
  probably take it all (and maybe even a bit more eventually). Take a
  taste. Add some more salt if needed. It will be good but not perfect
  at this point. Taste it again. Note the vinegar flavor peeking
  through. It may even be fairly vinegary (that's a word, right?).
  Cover and put in a fridge over night. That's the last big secret.
  Taste again after sitting in the fridge overnight. Notice that the
  vinegar flavor is much softer. Add some more vinegar and let that
  absorb for an hour or two. You may well have used much more than the
  1 cup total by this point. Salt to taste if needed. You can serve
  this without the over-night setting but it will truly be a noticeably
  better salad the next day. You will want to adjust the amount of mayo
  to suit your taste. I like a pretty mayoee salad. Probably even a bit
  more than this calls for. Some don't. You may want more or less
  celery. My wife doesn't like any (egads!) None of these amounts need
  be exact, but they are close enough for a good starting point. The
  key is to use more vinegar than you could have imagined, sprinkling
  well while the potatoes are hot and firm but not crunchy. The rest is
  all to taste. I've never served this to a group that didn't ohh and
  ahh over it. It is a bit of an effort but if you take the time you
  will have some of the best potato salad ever.

      Title: BEST EVER SPONGE
 Categories: Cakes, Desserts, Low-fat
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
MMMMM------------------------2 EGG SPONGE-----------------------------
      2    Eggs
    1/3 c  Caster sugar
      2 tb Cornflour
      2 tb Plain flour
      2 tb Self-raising flour

MMMMM------------------------3 EGG SPONGE-----------------------------
      3    Eggs
    1/2 c  Caster sugar
    1/4 c  Cornflour
    1/4 c  Plain flour
    1/4 c  Self-raising flour

MMMMM------------------------4 EGG SPONGE-----------------------------
      4    Eggs
    2/3 c  Caster sugar
    1/3 c  Cornflour
    1/3 c  Plain flour
    1/3 c  Self-raising flour
 
  This is a favorite never-fail sponge recipe: it does not contain
  liquid or butter, which makes it ideal for Swiss rolls. It is simple
  to adapt to many flavors and will work as a cake or a roll. Have eggs
  at room temperature. Beat whole eggs in small bowl with electric
  mixer until thick and creamy (the small bowl is necessary to give
  maximum volume to eggs); beating time on a moderately high speed
  should be about 7 mins. Add sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time,
  beating after each addition until sugar is dissolved.
  
  While eggs and sugar are beating, prepare pans by greasing evenly
  (see lift of pan sizes below); and sift dry ingredients together 3
  times, to aerate and mix the flours.
  
  When sugar is dissolved, transfer mixture to larger basin; this makes
  it easier to fold the ingredients through the egg mixture *it is not
  necessary to transfer the 2 egg mixture to a larger basin). Sift the
  flours over the egg mixture, use a spatula to lightly fold the flours
  through; heavy handling at this stage will give a flat, tough sponge.
  Spread mixture evenly into pan, bake in moderate oven for cooking
  time specified below. When cooked, sponge will have shrunk very
  slightly from side of pan and top of sponge will feel springy when
  touched gently with fingertips. Turn sponge immediately onto wire
  rack to cool, then reverse sponge so that wire rack does not mark the
  top.
  
  Cake Pans and Cooking Times:
  
  2 egg: Deep 20cm round cake pan or recess pan about 20 mins. A deep
  pan is preferable rather than a sandwich pan as the sponge will be
  less crusty on top because the high sides protect the top during
  cooking.
  
  3 egg: 2 deep 17cm cake or sandwich pans about 15 mins, or 25cm x 30cm
  Swiss roll pan about 12 mins.
  
  4 egg: 2 deep 20cm round cake pans about 20 mins, or deep 23cm round
  cake pan about 40 mins.
  
  Variations:
  
  Citrus:  Beat in 2 teaspoons of your favorite grated citrus rind with
  the sugar.  Try lemon, mandarin, lime, orange or grapefruit.
  
  Nut:  Fold in 1/4 cup of any type of ground nuts with the flours.
  
  Chocolate:  Fold in 60g grated dark chocolate with the flours.
  
  Fill and ice sponges as desired.
  
  Keeping time: 2 days.

  4 1/2 qt Duck stock saved from a
           -prior roasting, or Basic
           -Chicken Stock, or three
      4 cn (6-ounce) chicken broth,
           -skimmed, or water
      1 ts Kosher salt
    3/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
 
  Remove the duck from the refrigerator. Let sit at room temperature
  for the 20 minutes that are needed for the next step.
  
  Pour stock into a tall narrow stockpot. Be sure there is enough room
  left in the pot for the duck. By using a narrow pot, less stock is
  needed to cover the duck than in a wider pot. Add the wing tips,
  neck, giblets, and any blood from the duck. Cover the pot and bring
  to a boil over high heat.
  
  Meanwhile, using the tines of a fork, thoroughly prick the duck all
  over, paying special attention to the fattiest areas. Insert the
  tines at an angle so there is a minimum risk of pricking the meat
  beneath. Carefully lower the duck into the boiling stock, neck end
  first, allowing the cavity to fill with stock so the duck sinks to
  the bottom of the pot. To keep the duck submerged, place a plate or
  pot cover over the duck to weight it down. The Japanese
  otoshi-buta-wooden lids that are 1 1/2 to 2 inches smaller than the
  diameter of the pot-are perfect.
  
  When the stock returns to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer 45
  minutes. Even with the plate as weight, the duck will tend to float
  to the surface, so check about every
       10    to
       15    minutes to see that the duck remains submerged. Keep the
  stock at a gentle simmer; if it boils, the duck will rise to the
  surface.
  
  When the duck has finished simmering, spoon 1 tablespoon of the duck
  fat off the top of the stock and spread it in the bottom of a shallow
  12 x 8 x 1 1/2-inch roasting pan. Remove the plate and carefully lift
  out the duck, holding it over the pot to drain any liquid from the
  cavity. Place duck in roasting pan. Do not tuck the neck flap under
  the duck. Spread it out in the pan.
  
  Pat the duck thoroughly dry and lightly coat the skin with the salt
  and pepper or one of the optional ingredients, gently pressing them
  against the skin. The duck is hot and the skin is tender, so work
  carefully. The duck may be prepared ahead up to this point and
  refrigerated for a day. If made ahead, return duck to room
  temperature. If proceeding with roasting right away, for optimum
  results, leave the duck sitting out at room temperature for 30
  minutes to permit the skin to dry and heat the oven to 500 degrees
  with oven rack on the second level from the bottom.
  
  Place duck in oven legs first. Roast 30 minutes. After 10 minutes,
  spoon out the fat that accumulates in the roasting pan. Move the duck
  around in the pan with a wooden spatula to prevent the skin from
  sticking to the bottom of the pan. If it is easier, remove the pan
  from the oven being careful of the hot fat and spoon off fat. This
  will avoid getting fat on the inside of the oven, which would smoke.
  Make sure the oven door is closed, so that the temperature doesn't go
  down.
  
  After the full 30 minutes, remove the duck from the pan. Pour or
  spoon off the fat, and deglaze pan with stock or water.
  
  When time is available, skim duck stock and place in freezer
  containers for the next time, or add carcasses and bones back into
  pan and cook as Duck Stock, Double Rich. Posted to MM-Recipes Digest

      Title: BEST-EVER CINNAMON ROLLS
 Categories: Breads, Breakfast
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  4 1/2    To 5 cups all-purpose flour
      1 pk Dry yeast (about 1 1/2 tsp.)
      1 c  Milk
    1/3 c  Butter
    1/3 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      3    Eggs
    3/4 c  Packed brown sugar
    1/4 c  All-purpose flour
      1 tb Ground cinnamon
    1/2 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Light raisins
    1/2 c  Chopped pecans
      1 tb Half-and-half or light cream
      1    Recipe Powdered Sugar Glaze
           -(to follow)
 
  "The best part about making this recipe is that the dough can be
  mixed and the rolls filled and shaped the night before. When you
  awake in the morning, just bake. Waiting for the rolls to come out of
  the oven is the hardest part"
  
  In a large mixer bowl, combine 2 1/4 cups of the flour and the yeast.
  
  In a small saucepan heat the milk, the 1/3 cup butter, the 1/3 cup
  sugar, and salt just till warm (120 degrees to 130 degrees) and
  butter is almost melted, stirring constantly. Add to flour mixture.
  Add eggs. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds,
  scraping sides of bowl constantly.  Beat on high speed for 3 minutes.
  Using a wooden spoon, stir in as much of the remaining 2 1/4 to 2 3/4
  cups flour as you can.
  
  Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead in enough of the
  remaining flour to make a moderately soft dough that is smooth and
  elastic (3 to 5 minutes total). Shape into a ball. Place in a greased
  bowl, turning once.  Cover; let rise in a warm place till double
  (about 1 hour).
  
  For filling, combine brown sugar, the 1/4 cup flour, and cinnamon.
  Cut in remaining butter till crumbly; set aside.
  
  Punch dough down.  Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Cover and let
  rest for 10 minutes.  Roll the dough into a 12" square.
  
  Sprinkle filling over dough square; top with raisins and pecans. Roll
  up jelly-roll style; pinch edges to seal. Slice roll into eight 1
  1/2" pieces. Arrange dough pieces, cut side up, in a greased 12"
  deep-dish pizza pan or a 13x9x2" baking pan.
  
  Cover dough loosely with clear plastic wrap, leaving room for rolls to
  rise.  Refrigerate rolls 2 to 24 hours. Uncover and let stand at room
  temperature for 30 minutes (Or, for immediate baking, don't chill
  dough. Instead, cover loosely; let dough rise in a warm place till
  nearly double, about 45 minutes).
  
  Break any surface bubbles with a greased toothpick. Brush dough with
  half-and-half or light cream.  Bake in a 375 degree oven for 25 to 30
  minutes or till light brown. If necessary to prevent overbrowning,
  cover rolls loosely with foil the last 5 to 10 minutes of baking.
  Remove rolls from oven.  Brush again with half-and-half or light
  cream. Cool for 1 minute. Carefully invert cinnamon rolls onto a wire
  rack. Cool slightly. Invert again onto a serving platter. Drizzle
  with Powdered Sugar Glaze. Serve warm.  Makes
        8    rolls.
  
  VARIATION:  Apple Cinnamon Rolls: Prepare rolls as directed, except
  substitute 1 cup finely chopped apple for the raisins in the filling.
  
  POWDERED SUGAR GLAZE:
  
  In a bowl stir together 1 1/4 cups sifted powdered sugar, 1 tsp. corn
  syrup, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, and enough half-and-half or light cream (1
  to 2 Tbsp.) to make of drizzling consistency.

      Title: BEST: BISCUIT MIX
 Categories: Biscuits, Mix
      Yield: 15 Cups
 
      9 c  Cake-and-pastry flour
      1 c  Skim milk powder
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
    1/4 c  Baking powder
      1 tb Salt
      2 ts Baking soda
      1 lb Shortening
 
  In large bowl, stir together flour, milk powder, sugar, baking
  powder, salt and baking soda. Using pastry blender, cut in shortening
  until mixture is in fine crumbs. Transfer to airtight container;
  store in refrigerator for up to 2 months.
  
  Stir well before using.
  
  [Crisco Golden variety shortening adds colour and flavour.]
  
  See "Best: Golden Tea Biscuit" for use of mix.
  
  Biscuit Tips:
  
  1. When measuring large quantities of dry ingredients, measure each
  into separate bowl; that way, if you lose count, you can recheck
  measure before mixing ingredients.
  
  2. Always pour liquid ingredients over the entire surface of the dry
  ingredients, meanwhile tossing lightly with fork to incorporate dry
  ingredients into wet without overworking the flour.
  
  3. Dip cutter into flour between cutting each biscuit to prevent
  dough from sticking to cutter.
  
  4. Any scraps left over after cutting dough can be sprinkled with
  sugar, then baked. Or, to avoid wastage, pat dough into a square,
  then cut into squares instead of rounds.
  
  5. Because biscuits are rich in fat, you don't need to grease the
  baking sheet. You can leave the sheet ungreased or sprinkle baking
  sheet lightly with all-purpose flour.
  
  6. To ensure even browning and baking, make each biscuit the same
  size and shape.
  
  7. To remove sticky batter from bowl and fork, first rinse with cold
  water before washing in hot soapy water.

      Title: BETTER-THAN-SALT HERB BLEND
 Categories: Seasonings, Herb/spice
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    Bay leaves -- finely
           Chopped
      4 tb Oregano
      4 tb Onion powder
      4 ts Marjoram
      4 ts Basil leaves
      4 ts Winter savory -- ground
      4 ts Garlic powder
      2 ts Rosemary leaves --
      1 ts Sage
      1 ts Thyme
      1 ts Black pepper -- ground
      1 tb Lemon zest -- dried
 
  The recipe is for dried herbs. If you have your own herb garden, do
  try drying your own. They will dry in seconds in a microwave, or in a
  longer time in a warm oven (about 180 degrees). Leave the oven door
  slilghtly ajar to allow moisture escape.
  
  Unless you have not time and patience that I have, buy the onion and
  garlic powders. I have tried chopping my own fresh garlic and onion,
  but they take too long to dry for me.
  
  Mix and crush to a coarse powder with a mortar and pestle or a small
  blender or food processor.
  
  The Herb Blend is delicious on slald greens, on sliced tomatoes and
  cucumbers, on fish, hamburgers, meat loaves, steaks, omelets, etc. Try
  mixing the Herb Blend with a stick of butter or margarine. Let stand
  in refrigerator for a day of two for good flavor. Use Herbed butter on
  vegetables, breads, meats, fish, etc.

      Title: BETTY CROCKER'S COOKBOOK 6TH EDITION - INTRO
 Categories: Info, Crocker
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           See Below
 
  For most of this century, the name signature and portrait of Betty
  Crocker have been symbols of quality recipes and have won the
  confidence of millions.
  
  Betty Crocker's cookbook and recipe heritage can be traced back to the
  1890s-with the purchase and distribution of Miss Parloa's New Cook
  Book by the Washburn Crosby Company forerunner of General Mills.
  However, it was not until 1921 that "Betty Crocker" first appeared as
  the signature on letters replying to thousands of questions about
  cooking and baking.
  
  In 1936, the Betty Crocker name, by then famous, was given a face
  when theù first official portrait of Betty Crocker was commissioned.
  In the years that followed, there were five other "sittings." In
  1986, the seventh and most recent portrait in the series was
  introduced. As the previous ones reflected changing times, the
  current Betty Crocker portrait reflects the 1980s.
  
  In 1950 cooking and baking information was in such great demand that
  the need for a wide-ranging basic cookbook seemed clear. Simply
  called Betty Crocker's Picture Cookbook, the volume collected under
  one cover the recipes, advice and expertise accumulated over the
  years. It was an instant success-the nonfiction best-seller for that
  year!
  
  Betty Crocker's Picture Cookbook was revised twice before it was
  replaced in 1969 by Betty Crocker's Cookbook. This was later updated
  and a new edition was published in 1978.
  
  Now new and again revised, this is the sixth edition of the all-time
  best-selling cookbook.
  
  With its straightforward, easy-to-understand language and tested
  recipes, Betty Crocker's Cookbook has introduced millions to the
  heritage of American cooking. In recognition of this outstanding
  contribution, Betty Crocker's Cookbook received the distinction of
  becoming the sixth book to be placed in the R.T. French Cookbook Hall
  of Fame.
  
  Like its predecessors, this edition mirrors an American lifestyle and
  stands ready to serve a new generation.
  
  FOREWORD
  
  What we eat, how we prepare it and even who prepares it-all have
  changed dramatically since 1950 when the first edition of the
  best-selling Betty Crocker's Cookbook appeared. Consequently, when we
  planned and developed this sixth edition of Betty Crocker's Cookbook,
  we did more than revise. We created a book specifically for today's
  needs. And to assure success, we relied on one indispensable
  ingredient-you.
  
  We monitored your new food tastes and discovered that what was once
  exotic is now mainstream. We investigated emerging trends, and looked
  for new twists to add to the basics. Most importantly, we were guided
  by your letters and telephone calls. The trained staff of our
  Consumer Relations Department communicates with nearly 10,000 of you
  each month.
  
  Your growing awareness of the need for good nutrition became
  evident-you choose poultry and fish over red meat, eat more fresh
  fruits and vegetables, and use less fat in cooking. So, with the
  assistance of our Nutrition Department, we have provided a calorie
  count with each recipe plus special chapter-by-chapter charts with
  computer-calculated nutrients.
  
  We found all members of the family sharing the responsibility for food
  preparation. Therefore our recipes are clearly written, with
  easy-to-follow directions. How-to illustrations, information charts,
  special tips-all help even the beginner to feel comfortable and
  confident in the kitchen.
  
  Since time saving and ease of preparation are so important to you,
  there are do-ahead tips and microwave variations. Many main dish
  recipes are flagged "Easy. . . " and most main dish recipes feature
  menu suggestions to help take the guesswork out of go-togethers.
  
  The Special Helps chapter is actually a mini-encyclopedia of cooking
  basics and tips, food preparation terms, microwave principles, food
  storage guidelines and more.
  
  Responsive to change and true to tradition this new and revised Betty
  Crocker's Cookbook contains all that you have asked for, and offers
  one more advantage-the dependability you have come to expect from
  recipes developed and tested in the Betty Crocker Kitchens. The Betty
  Crocker Editors

  careful that they do not turn a dark brown.  Transfer to a bowl &
  wash if desired.
  
  Bring water to a boil & stir in the dal along with the turmeric &
  whole chiles.  Simmer, covered, until the dal is tender, 35 to 45
  minutes. While cooking, uncover & stir occasionally. Add salt, sugar,
  cumin & coriander. Keep warm.
  
  Heat oil in a skillet.  Add bay leaf & kalonji & fry for a few
  seconds. Add ginger & minced green chile & fry until the ginger is
  lightly browned which should be no more than 2 minutes. Stir
  constantly. Pour into the dal & mix well.  Simmer for a further
  couple of minutes & remove from heat. Blend in the garam masala,
  lemon or lime juice & ghee if desired. Cover & let stand to let the
  flavours develop. Garnish & serve.

      Title: BHARATTI
 Categories: Grains, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Basmati rice (Carolina will
           Do)
      2 md Onions
        bn Fresh basil leaves (about
           Half cup when chopped)
      1 tb Curry powder (mild or hot,
           According to preference)
      1 ts Salt
      4 tb Good grade cooking oil
    500 g  (just over 1 lb) ground
           Chicken or lean pork
 
  Chop onions and fry in 2 tbsp oil until just starting to brown. Add
  meat and curry powder, stir until brown. Scoop out onions and meat,
  leaving oil in pan. Add dry rice and stir until transparent. Add 4
  cups water and salt, bring to boil, cover and cook over LOW flame for
  15 mins or until all water is absorbed. Add meat, onions, finely
  chopped basil and the rest of the oil, stir and cook for another 3
  mins.
  
  (You could eat it now, but here comes the trick):
  
  Put everything in shallow glass dish, cover with paper towel and
  microwave on full power for another 10 to 15 mins. (YES, that long!)
  
  The final ordeal in the microwave oven will turn the individual
  grains of rice crispy on the outside, leaving their cores soft - a
  heavenly crunchy sensation.

 Categories: Appetizers, Indian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Puffed Rice (1 carton Rice
           Krispies may be
      1 pk Bhel  mix or Sev
      2 c  Mashed Boiled potatoes
           (mashed crudely and
    1/2 c  Chopped Fresh Coriander
           Leaves (a.k.a Chin
      3 tb Freshly roasted and ground
           Cumin
           To taste Green chillies
           Freshly ground black pepper
           To taste Tamarind
           To taste Jaggery
           -(or Brown Sugar)
      1 c  Chopped onions.
 
  1. First boil the potatoes. Mash them  and  salt them, add pepper to
  taste. Add some coriander leaves too.
  
  2. Roast the cumin and grind it.
  
  3. Dissolve  about 4 tbsp of Tamarind concentrate in 1 cup of hot
  water, and let it simmer to thicken gradually. Dissolve the jaggery
  (or sugar) till the sauce becomes tart and slightly sweet. (You may
  add some salt and ground red paprika, if you want to). The sauce
  should be of a consistency slightly thinner than maple syrup. Pour
  into a serving container (like a creamer).  Mix the puffed rice and
  sev/bhel mix in a large bowl.
  
  4. On  your  plate,  serve  yourself  the  rice-bhel mixture, add the
  potatoes, then the onions, chillies, dust the cumin powder over it.
  Then pour the sauce. Top with the coriander garnish. (Add salt/pepper
  to taste).
  
  5. Mix the goop in your plate and eat it soon.
  
  Note: This  is  a  concoction that I often bought from street vendors
  in India.  My mouth still waters whenever I think of Bhel. The recipe
  presented  here was taken off the net and I haven't had a chance to
  try it yet.  I include the note from the contributors:
  
  Warning: this recipe is directed at those  who  know what Bhelpuri
  tastes like, quantities mentioned are approximate, proportions are
  left to the readers, to their taste. Purists will have to go to an
  Indian grocery shop. Deviationists  may  use substitutes) The most
  important thing is to keep the puffed rice-sev mixture crisp by not
  adding the other ingredients to it until serving, and do so on your
  plate.

      2 tb Olive oil
    1/2 lb Pancetta or bacon
      1 md Yellow onion

      4    Eggs
      4 tb Heavy cream
      8 tb Parmesan cheese
           -(grated)
 
  Put large bowl in oven to warm at lowest possible setting. Soak
  chopped onion in cold water for 15 minutes to reduce pungency. Chop
  Pancetta or bacon into 1/4-inch x 1-inch strips.
  
  Beat eggs and cream together with a fork.  Add about 4 T Parmesan
  cheese to the mixture.
  
  Wash pasta.  Put on water to cook pasta.  Add pasta when boiling. In
  the meantime...
  
  Dry onions and saute with pancetta or bacon in olive oil until onions
  are barely translucent.  Add wine and reduce heat when initial
  boiling ceases. Meat should not be crisp.
  
  When pasta is cooked, drain, but DO NOT WASH.  Quickly remove bowl
  from oven, put pasta in it and toss with egg, cream and cheese
  mixture so that heat from pasta cooks eggs. Add meat, onions and wine
  without draining fat and toss until thoroughly mixed. Sprinkle
  remaining cheese to taste, toss and serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Spaghetti Carbonara, Neapolitan Style -- My wife and I had the
  pleasure of staying at the Villa Virgiliana (owned by The Vergilian
  Society) in Cuma, Italy just outside of Naples in June, 1985. Biagio
  and Maria Sgariglia, the proprietors of the villa, served us
  excellent Italian farm meals for a week, each meal being more
  delicious than the last. This dish was the gastronomic highlight of
  our stay.
  
  *  Pasta should be cooked AL DENTE so that it offers resistance to the
  teeth without crunching. Fresh pasta is desirable (dried pasta is a
  poor imitation of the real thing.) Pasta should be used immediately
  when done so as to stop its internal cooking. If both portions of the
  recipe cannot be completed at the same time, the meat and onion
  mixture should finish first.
  
  *  I have made a very successful variation on this using hot country
  sausage. Make sure the sausage is fairly lean if you try it, however.
  All of the quantities are adjustable and may depend on the kind of
  pasta or meat you use. Too much cream will cause the egg mixture to
  separate from the pasta and meat. Too little cream will essentially
  give you scrambled eggs and bacon with pasta.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate to hard (timing is critical).
  : Time:  30 minutes.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: BIBINGKANG MALAGKIT
 Categories: Thai, Rice, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      4    14-ounce cans coconut milk
  2 1/2 c  Glutinous rice
    1/2 c  Long grain rice
      4 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Brown sugar, packed
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Ground peanuts or pilli
           -nuts, optional
      3    Eggs beaten
 
  While wading through my pile of newspaper clippings I ran across the
  following gem.  I can't help but think that it might be even better
  if you used palm sugar instead of the brown sugar. Never heard of
  "pilli" nuts++any idea what they are?
  
  Open cans of coconut milk without shaking.  Spoon off thick milk that
  has risen to top and measure 2 cups. Measure 4 cups remaining thinner
  milk. Freeze any unused coconut milk.
  
  Mix glutinous and long-grain rice in a bowl.  Cover with hot water
  and let stand for 5 minutes.  Drain rice and turn into a heavy
  4-quart saucepan. Mix thin coconut milk, granulated sugar and salt
  with rice.
  
  Bring to boil, reduce heat to very low and cook, covered until rice is
  tender but not soft, about 30 minutes. Turn rice into well-greased
  13- by 9-inch baking pan, flatten rice and smooth top; set aside.
  
  Mix thick coconut milk and brown sugar in a saucepan. Add vanilla and
  nuts. Cook and stir until sugar dissolves and syrup thickens, about 5
  minutes. Gradually stir some of the hot mixture into eggs, then
  return to saucepan and cook, stirring constantly, until slightly
  thickened, about 1 minute. Pour topping evenly over rice.
  
  Bake in a 375F oven for 30 minutes.  Remove from oven and cool to room
  temperature.  Cut into squares to serve.
  
  Serves 16 to 20.

           -head)
      2 tb Butter
      1 md Onion, chopped
      1    Celery stalk, chopped
    1/2 ts Salt
      6    Peppercorns
      3    Whole cloves

      1    Bottle beer
      6    Gingersnaps, crushed
      1 tb Sugar
           -fresh parsley for garnish
 
  This recipe is an old tradition in Germany. The sauce combines sweet,
  sour, and spicy flavors. In Germany, fresh carp is used, but since it
  is hard to find in the U.S. other fish may be substituted.
  
  Remove head from fish and reserve for making fish stock for other
  recipes. Lay fish out as flat as possible, breaking bones along back.
  Melt butter in a skillet. Add onion, celery, salt, peppercorns and
  cloves and mix. Top with lemon slices and bay leaf. Place fish on
  top. Add beer. Cover and simmer 15-20 minutes, or just until fish
  flakes with fork. Transfer fish to a platter, cover with foil to keep
  warm. Strain cooking liquid, pressing some of the vegetables through.
  Put gingersnaps and sugar in s killet, stir in 1-1/2 cups strained
  liquid. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Garnish fish with
  parsley. Pass sauce for pouring over fish and boiled potatoes as side
  dish. Makes 4-6 servings. From the files of Al Rice, North Pole

      3 tb Butter

      1 tb Banana liqueur

MMMMM---------------------BANANA WHIP CREAM--------------------------
      2 c  Cream
      3 tb Sugar
      2 tb Banana liqueur
 
  FOR CRUST: Mix flour, salt and sugar. Cut in butter and shortening
  until it looks like flaky meal. Sprinkle in ice water. Work into a
  ball that cleans the sides of the mixing bowl. (To mix in a food
  processor, place dry ingredients in work bowl, top with butter and
  shortening, an pulse until mealy. With machine running, pour in the
  ice water all at once. When dough forms a ball that knocks around the
  sides of the machine, stop immediately.)
  
  Flatten dough into a disk, then wrap with plastic wrap, and chill 30
  minutes (or freeze).
  
  Heat oven to 425 for a glass pie plate; 450 for metal. Roll dough to a
  circle 3 to 4 inches wider than the pie plate. Set in plate and cut
  overhang with scissors so dough extends 3/4 inch beyond the rim. Fold
  overhang under so it is even with plate's rim and crimp large flutes.
  Prick the bottom and sides all over with a fork, about 50 times.
  Cover bottom with foil, fill with rice or beans, and bake 15 minutes.
  Pour off grains and foil and return crust to oven to bake 5 to 10
  minutes more. Crust should be pale.
  
  FOR FILLING: Stir yolks and set bowl in a place convenient to the
  stove.
  
  In a heavy saucepan, whisk flour, cornstarch, sugar, and milk until
  free of lumps. Set over medium-high heat and bring to a boil,
  stirring constantly. Boil for 2 minutes, stirring fast and getting
  into the corners of the pot.
  
  Remove from heat and whisk a little of the milk into the egg yolks,
  then pour the tempered yolks into the hot milk. Continue to cook
  another FULL 2 minutes, stirring constantly. If lumps form, strain
  into a bowl.
  
  Pour into a bowl and add butter, banana liqueur, and vanilla,
  stirring to cool. Press plastic wrap onto surface to prevent a skin
  from forming. Set filling aside while you prepare the bananas.
  
  FOR CARAMALIZED BANANAS: Place butter and brown sugar in large
  skillet; slice in the bananas. Heat over medium-high heat until
  butter melts and sugar begins to caramelize, about 3 minutes. Don't
  over-mush the bananas. Shake the pan to distribute bananas instead of
  bruising them with a tool. (If you must use a tool, use a rubber
  spatula.) With heat high, pour in liqueur all at once. Ignite with a
  match and let flame subside by itself. Pour bananas onto a jelly-roll
  pan to cool quickly.
  
  TO ASSEMBLE: Line the baked pie shell with cooled bananas. Top with
  filling (which may still be warm). Wrap pie in plastic and
  refrigerate until filling sets, about 6 hours.
  
  In a cold bowl, with cold beaters, whip the cream, sugar, and liqueur
  to stiff peaks. Pipe from a pastry bag fitted with a large
  star-shaped tip with a wide opening. You will have lots of whipped
  cream, so the designs can be big, even garish. Make rows, rounds,
  mounds, or swirls. Chill again, and keep cold until serving.
  
  To slice wedges, use a smooth knife dipped in a tall glass of hot
  water, then wiped dry.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 90 Servings
 
      2 pk Dry yeast
      4 c  Warm water (105f--115f)
      1 c  Instant nonfat dry milk
           (1 1-quart envelope)
      1 c  Sugar
      1 c  Vegetable oil
      1 tb Salt (I used 1/2)
      2 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Baking soda
     11    To 12 cups all-purpose flour
           Melted butter or margarine
 
  A GOOD ROLL RECIPE TO MAKE AHEAD AND FREEZE FOR DINNERS Dissolve
  yeast in warm water in a LARGE mixing bowl; let stand 5 minutes. Add
  dry milk powder and next 5 ingredients; beat at medium speed of an
  electric mixer until blended.  Gradually stir in enough flour to make
  a very soft dough. Place dough in a well-greased bowl; turning to
  grease top. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours.      Punch dough
  down; divide dough in half. Working with one portion of dough at a
  time, place dough on a lightly floured surface; knead until smooth
  and elastic, adding more flour, if necessary. Roll dough to 1/4-inch
  thickness. Cut dough with a 2-1/2-inch round cutter.
   Make a crease with dull edge of knife just off center on each round.
  Brush lightly with melted butter.
   Fold larger side over smaller so that the edges will meet. Seal.
  Place 15 rolls in a lightly greased 8-inch square baking pan. Repeat
  procedure filling two additional 8-inch square pans.
   Repeat procedure with remaining portion of dough, filling 3
  additional square pans.  (NOTE: When I made these rolls, I used a
  total of 7 toaster oven size pans, each holding about 2 dozen rolls)
  Cover and let rise in a warm place, (85F), free from drafts, 40
  minutes or until rolls are doubled in bulk. Bake at 375F. for 10--15
  minutes. NOTE: To Freeze, prepare and bake rolls as directed; let
  cool.  Wrap in tin foil; freeze. To serve, let rolls thaw; then bake
  in foil at 375F. degrees or until thoroughly heated. SOURCE: Southern

      6 tb Flour
      1 cn Mushroom soup
           Salt & pepper to taste
      2 tb Frying fat
 
  If you kill a big buck and know he will not be as tender as my
  spikehorns, cut a round steak about 2 inches thick, dredge in flour,
  let stand for an hour and then reflour the wet spots. Sear on both
  sides in a hot, lightly-greased skillet or black iron pot. Now pour
  the can of soup directly onto the center of the steak, then add
  enough hot water to cover the meat. Cover the pot or skillet, cook in
  a moderate (375) oven for about 2 hours or until tender. Suggestions:
  TRY adding cutup turnips and fresh green beans around the meat, just
  before pouring the mushroom soup on. Recipe date: 01/15/87

  *Dried **(use a real good cut like a cross rib roast and have your
  butcher grind it in "chili grind" dried Rule #1 in Chili Cookoffs: If
  you know beans about chili, you know chili ain't got no beans! This
  recipe is a lot of work, but well worth it! Oregano Tea (bring 2 c
  water to boil; add 2 T dried oregano leaves. Brew like tea; stain,
  reserving liquid) Remove the stems, seeds, and veins from peppers;
  add to boiling water 30 minutes. Use a knife and strip meat off
  peppers, discard skins; put into food processor with enough beer to
  make the consistency of tomato sauce. Divide the bacon, garlic,
  onions, sausage and beef into thirds. We are going to fry up the
  mixture 1/3 a time. Fry up the bacon (mostly for grease) until just
  about crisp. Add garlic, and after 30 seconds, add onions, hot sauce
  to taste, salt and pepper. When the onions are translucent, add the
  sausage. When about half cooked, add beef. When the mixture is about
  medium, drain the grease and refry until well done (this sears the
  meat and keeps the flavor in). When done, put into pot. Repeat for
  next 1/3 and last 1/3. Stir in the pepper paste (from above), broth,
  and tomato sauce. Take your time--over low heat. Then add the
  remaining ingredients, one at a time, slowly. Add enough beer to keep
  the consistency to your liking. Now adjust the spices like a real
  expert! Cook over low heat 2+ hours, and you'll have one fine bowl of
  red! Enjoy! Mike FROM: MIKE CROUCH (NNBB09A)

      Title: BIG SOFT CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 18 Cookies
 
  1 1/2    Sticks Unsalted Butter
      2 c  + 2 Tbl. Unsifted, Bleached,
           -All Purpose Flour
    1/2 ts Baking Soda
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Light or Dark Brown Sugar
    1/2 c  Granulated Sugar
      1 lg Egg + 1 Yolk
      2 ts Pure Vanilla Extract
  1 1/2 c  Chocolate Chips
 
  Place a rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat oven to 325 F.
  Temperature is critical so use an oven thermometer to verify the
  correct oven temperature and adjust as necessary. Melt the butter in
  a small saucepan and set aside to cool until its lukewarm. In a
  large bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, and salt. Do not sift.
  Place both sugars in a medium mixing bowl. Pour melted butter into
  sugar and mix until completely blended. Add egg, yolk, and vanilla
  extract. Mix until blended. Add flour mixture and mix until blended.
  Add chocolate chips. Mix just until chips are evenly distributed.
  
  Line 11 x 17 cookie sheets with parchment paper. Dont use waxed
  paper. Its too flammable.
  
  Baking Instructions: Using a scant 1/4 cup of cookie dough, roll a
  ball in the palms of your hands. Grab the ball with the fingertips of
  both hands and pull the dough into two pieces resembling half moons.
  Rotate the halves so the two jagged/flat sides point toward the
  ceiling and push the two halves together. Youll now have a cookie
  with a jagged top surface (they look like little tree stumps). (I
  didn't do this for all of them and they were fine) Place the cookies
  (about 6 per sheet) onto the cookie sheets. Put cookies in oven and
  bake for 15 minutes.
  
  Start checking for doneness after about 13 minutes and every two
  minutes thereafter. They are done when they are turning light golden
  brown and the edges are starting to get dry and firm while the
  centers are still soft. Cool cookies completely on their cookie
  sheets.
  
  The twin secrets to these "mall style" cookies are the melted butter
  and the extra egg yolk.
  
  Serving Suggestions Serve warm or allow to cool completely. Store
  completely cooled cookies in airtight containers, separating layers of
  cookies with waxed paper. The dough will keep refrigerated for 2 days
  and frozen for about 30 days. Be sure to wrap it closely with plastic
  wrap and place it in an airtight container. Thaw frozen dough
  overnight in the refrigerator. Baked cookies will keep in the freezer
  for a few weeks. Wrap individually in plastic wrap. Thaw 15 minutes
  at room temperature for a quick cookie fix.
  
  NOTES: 1) The dark brown sugar makes darker colored cookies. The light
  brown or golden brown sugar makes lighter colored cookies. I prefer
  the dark ones because of the little extra flavor the molasses adds.
  2) For a nice variation, use light brown sugar instead of dark,
  substitute white chocolate chips, and add 2 or 3 tsp. grated orange
  peel (from one large orange), to the batter. These are called White
  Chip, Orange Dream Cookies.

      Title: BIG SOFT PRETZELS
 Categories: Breadmaker, Mixes, Kids, Breads, Snacks
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -JOY QUIRK   (HFTC65A)
      1 tb Dry yeast
      5 c  Bread mix; up to six
  1 1/2 c  -lukewarm water
      2    Eggs; beaten

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
      1    Egg; beaten
      2 tb Coarse salt
    1/2 c  Butter; melted
 
  Lightly grease 2 large baking sheets.  In a large bowl, dissolve
  yeast in lukewarm water.  Blend in 2 eggs and butter. Add 5 cups
  bread mix. Stir well.  Add additional bread mix to make a soft, but
  not too sticky dough. Knead about 5 minutes until dough is smooth.
  Roll pieces of dough into ropes about 1/2 inch in diameter and 18 to
  24 inches long. Form into pretzel shapes.  For pretzel sticks, cut
  dough into 5 to 6 inch lengths. Place on prepared baking sheets.
  Preheat oven to 425.
  
  Brush tops of pretzels with beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse salt.
  Bake immediately 12 to 15 minutes, until brown and crisp. Makes 12 to
  15 large pretzels.
  
  Variation For a chewier pretzel, drop pretzel-shaped dough into a pan
  of boiling water.  When dough floats to the top of the water, remove
  it. Preheat oven to 400. Brush with egg and sprinkle with coarse
  salt. Bake about 30 minutes.
  
  All of these recipes I have posted using my bread mix can be adjusted
  to use with the bread machine, some using the dough setting. I have
  had excellent results. Will try to post more over the weekend as I
  get time. Also have a lot of other "mix" recipes if anyone is
  interested.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Buttermilk
  1 1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
      1 ts Baking soda
      2 ts Vanilla extract
      1 c  Vegetable oil
      3 ts Baking powder
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      3 c  Unbleached flour
      2    Eggs
           Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
 
  Seedless raisins
  
  In a measuring cup, mix the buttermilk and baking soda; set aside. In
  a large mixer bowl, combine the oil, sugar, and eggs; mix well. Add
  the buttermilk-soda mixture and blend.  Then add the salt, nutmeg,
  vanilla, and baking powder and mix again. Blend in the flour (the
  batter will be very runny). Cover and refrigerate overnight. The next
  day, preheat oven to 400 F.  For the very best results, use ungreased
  non-stick baking sheets. Dark or shiny sheets conduct the heat
  differently, and the cookie will have crisp brown edges, which are
  just what you don't want. Use 1 heaping tablespoon of batter per
  cookie, and place them on the sheets. Liberally sprinkle more sugar
  on top of each cookie and dot with 3 raisins. Keep batter
  refrigerated between bakings. Bake for just 5 minutes. The cookies
  should be just barely done--still almost white. If they are golden,
  you have left them in too long.  Remove from oven, and allow the
  cookies to remain on the cookie sheet for 3 more minutes to continue
  baking. Carefully remove cookies with a metal spatula to a wax
  paper-covered rack to cool. The cookies keep well in tightly covered
  containers or can be frozen. In either case, each cookie should be
  wrapped individually or between layers of wax paper.  They are so
  tender, so moist, so cakelike that they cling together if this is not
  done.

      Title: BIGOS (SAUERKRAUT STEW)
 Categories: Polish, Stews
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4    Mushroom, dried
    1/4 c  ;Water
      2 lb Sauerkraut
      1 lg Apple; peeled/cored/sliced
     20 oz Tomato; canned
      5    Peppercorn
      1    Bay leaf
      1 lb Polish sausage; diced
      1 lb Stewing beef
      1 c  Bacon; coarsely chopped
 
  Soak the mushrooms in 1/4 cup water for 2 hours. Bring to boil and
  simmer for 1/2 hour. Slice.
  
  Wash the sauerkraut and sqeeze it. Add mushrooms and the liquid in
  which they were cooked. Add the apples, the tomatoes, peppercorns and
  bay leaf. Cover and simmer for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Add the meat
  and the bacon. Simmer 1 hour longer.
  
  My method differs a little bit. I rinse the sauerkraut and simmer it
  for about a 1/2 hour. In a separate pot I simmer the stewing beef for
  the same amount of time with whatever spices happen to fall into my
  hands at the time, including the peppercorns and the bay leaf.
  Meanwhile, in a large fry pan I fry the bacon, a large diced onion,
  the Polish sausage and the mushrooms. Then I drain the sauerkraut and
  mix it into the beef. Into that I mix in the bacon mixture. Then I
  simmer all that for about another hour.
  
  This dish tastes best reheated the next day. Serve with steamed
  potatoes or rye bread. Excellent for banquets and buffet
  entertaining. It also freezes well.

  Translation by Micaela "Stayka" Pantke - any mistakes are therefore
  mine. This recipe was taken from POLISH COOKING - Marianna Olszewska
  Heberle A harmonious blend of flavors known as the Polish national
  dish. Rinse sauerkraut with cold water; drain well.  In a large
  stockpot, combine sauerkraut, ham or pork, bay leaves, mushrooms,
  peppercorns, allspice and salt. Add 6 cups broth, bouillon or water.
  Cook, uncovered, 15 minutes over medium heat.  Cover and simmer over
  low heat 45 minutes. Remove meat. Let meat cool. Place cabbage in a
  large saucepan. Add remaining 5 cups broth, bouillon or water.  Bring
  to boil.  Cook, uncovered, over medium heat, 1 hour or until cabbage
  is tender. Add to sauerkraut mixture. Bone cooked meat.  Cut cooked
  meat into 1/2-inch cubes.  Melt butter or margarine in a large
  skillet.  Add cooked meat, smoked sausage and white sausage. Saute
  over medium heat 10 minutes or until browned. Add to sauerkraut
  mixture. In same skillet, saute bacon over medium heat until crisp.
  Drain bacon on paper towels. Add to sauerkraut mixture. Cover; cook
  over low heat 1 hour or longer.  Remove and discard bay leaves. Serve
  hot. Makes 12 to 14 servings. Use only meat with large bones, so
  bones can be removed easily. The secret of old-time Bigos is that it
  gets better as it's reheated on successive days, peaking at the 6th
  or 7th day. In between, store covered in the refrigerator.

  pieces back into the soup. Simmer for 15-20 minutes until soup is
  slightly thickened.
  
  Yield: 6-8 large servings. This soup is especially good when
  sprinkled with a few drops of hot pepper sauce just before serving.

           -(or whole golf size)
 
  In large Dutch oven, heat woo sauce, olive oil, salts and pepper. Add
  some margarine.  When oil is hot, sear roast quickly on all sides.
  Add beef broth and onion soup, plus seasonings to taste.
  
  Reduce heat to medium, a brisk simmer.  (NOT a rolling boil!) Add
  wine and cook *covered* 2 hours, or till starts to be tender.
  
  Peel and cut up vegetables, all about the same size slices. Add to
  roast. When potatoes are fork tender, remove cloves and serve.
  
  If fluid ever gets lower than half that you started with, add water.
  
  To reheat:  Prepare fresh vegetables.  Cover pot and bring to simmer.
  When warm, take meat out, put in vegetables (with meat on top so it's
  just steamed); cook 45 minutes. Might want to add soup instead of
  water.

      Title: BILL'S VENISON OR BUFFALO ROAST
 Categories: Check, Game, Native
      Yield: 1 Guideline
 
 
  Soak roast overnight in saltwater.  Rinse and dry off. Cut slits in
  top side of roast about 2-3 inches apart, depending on how spicy you
  want it. Alternate 1/2 clove of garlic and slices of green serano or
  jalapeno peppers.  Turn the roast over, repeat.  Do not add spices or
  salt.
  
  Cover roast HEAVILY all over with cheap prepared mustard. Put in dry
  pan. Cover heavily with yellow onion sliced in rings. Cover. Put in
  preheated 300 degree oven. Roast til it's really tender, slice across
  grain, serve with brown or wild rice and greens.
  
  Buffalo needs to be cooked at a low heat for a long time to make it
  tender. If you try to cook it on too high a heat, it will get tough,
  never, never to get tender again.
  
  This was Bill's Grandma Johnson's recipe for venison roast, but we
  used it on buffalo, too, and it was great.

  As you travel around East Africa you will see countless Africans
  selling food along the roadsides, in the markets, or through bus and
  train windows. They sell fruit, boiled eggs grilled maize, boiled
  maize, yogurt, milk, soda pop, fried dough balls, samosas, yellow
  buns, and real seasonal delicacies like roasted mice and termites.
  The following are a few East African snack foods you can try.
  
  "Beef Jerky" is more common in South Africa but still a part of the
  East African diet.  It is generally made from beef, but other game is
  used when available.  Cut strips of meat following the grain of
  muscle. Make strips 2 inches wide and 1 inch thick.  Best made during
  cool dry weather if possible.
  
  Salt the meat by rubbing the mixture in well and leave in the basin
  of salt mixture overnight.  Dip a cloth in vinegar, wring dry and
  whip the meat well.
  
  Hang the strips of meat in a cool, dry, well ventilated place until
  dry.
  
  You can also hang the meat on an oven rack placed in the top slot of
  the oven.  Dry the meat on low heat.

    1/2 c  Warm water
    1/2 c  Nonfat dry milk powder
    2/3 c  Sugar, granulated
    1/2 c  Oil, vegetable
      1 ts Salt
      2    Eggs
  1 1/3 c  Warm water
  7 1/2 c  Flour, all-purpose, as neede
 
  Soften yeast in 1/2 cup warm water for 10 minutes. Using a large food
  processor, electric mixer or wooden spoon, beat yeast mixture, dry
  milk powder, sugar, oil, salt and eggs until smooth. Add 1 1/3 cups
  warm water and 2 cups of the flour; beat until smooth.  Add remaining
  flour, a little at a time, beating well after each addition. Stop
  adding flour when a stiff dough is formed.  Without a heavy-duty
  mixer or food processor, you will need to work in the last of the
  flour with your hands. With dough hook or by hand on a lightly
  floured surface, knead until dough is smooth and elastic.  Place in a
  greased bowl and turn to grease top. Cover and let rise until double
  in bulk, about 2 1/2 hours. Punch dough down and fold over edges,
  pressing until air bubbles are pushed out. Divide dough into 4
  pieced.  form each piece into a loaf or ball. Place in greased 8x4
  inch loaf pans or 8-inch round cake pans. Cover and allow to rise
  until double in size, about 1 hour.  Bake in a preheated 350 oven for
  40 minutes or until nicely browned and done. Remove from pans and
  cool on wire racks. Freeze extra loaves for futureuse.

      2 ts Japanese soy sauce
      1 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Vegetable oil (about)

MMMMM-----------------------DIPPING SAUCE----------------------------
      4 tb Japanese soy sauce
  2 1/2 tb Rice vinegar
      1 ts Sugar
      1 tb Minced scallion
      1 ea Garlic clove
           -- peeled & mashed
 
  Wash and drain rice.  Pick over mung beans; wash and drain. Place
  rice and beans in a bowl and cover wtih 5 cups of water. Let soak for
  10 hours.
  
  Remove skins from beans by rubbing between your hands. Drain off
  floating skins now and then, replacing water with fresh water, until
  most all of the skins are removed and drained away. Drain off
  remaining water and blend rice and beans in a food processor until it
  becomes a thick paste. With machine running, gradually add 3/4 cup
  water to mixture; blend in thoroughly.
  
  Blanch bean sprouts in boiling water for 2 minutes; drain. Squeeze
  out as much moisture as possible, then stir sprouts into the batter
  along with the scallions, green pepper, onion, baking soda, sesame
  oil, sesame seeds, soy sauce and salt.  Mix well.
  
  Have all cooking paraphernalia ready and at hand.  You will need to
  have near your skillet: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of vegetable oil in a cup or
  bowl with a small spoon, a larger spoon to spread the batter, the
  bowl of batter with a 1/3-cup measuring scoop/cup, a metal spatula
  for turning the pancakes, and a plate on which to place the finished
  dosas after they are cooked.
  
  Pour 1 teaspoon of oil into the skillet and tilt to distribute
  evenly. Heat the skillet over medium-low until oil is hot. Pour 1/3
  cup of the mixture onto the center of the hot skillet. Use the large
  spoon to spread the batter in a spiral motion, until the pancake is
  about 6-7 inches in diameter.  Turn pancake after 2-3 minutes and
  cook another 2-3 minutes on the other side. Remove pancake to plate
  and repeat with remaining batter, adding only enough additional oil
  to the skillet as needed to keep surface evenly greased. I found that
  about 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon for each pancake was plenty, but your
  mileage may vary.
  
  Dipping Sauce: Mix together all ingredients and serve with hot
  Bindaetuk.

      4 c  Chicken stock; fresh or can

MMMMM----------------SILVER XPRESS MAIL SYSTEM 5---------------------
 
  NOTE:  In Egypt, as in much of the Middle East, rice is eaten in
  enormous quality.  This mold, therefore, is mainly composed of rice
  (about 9 cups when cooked), and the chicken is more or less a
  flavorful accompaniment for the rice.
    Preheat the oven to 400 degrees (F).  Using a pastry brush, heavily
  coat the bottom and sides of a round, deep 3 quart casserole or
  baking dish with the 4 tablespoons of softened butter.
    Spread 1 « cups of the rice evenly in the dish, arrange the pieces
  of chicken skin side up on top and sprinkle them liberally with salt
  and pepper.  In a small saucepan, bring the milk, cream and 2 cups of
  the stock to a boil over high heat and pour over the chicken. Spread
  the rest of the rice on top and dot evenly with the 2 tablespoons of
  the cut up butter.
    Bake uncovered on the lowest shelf of the oven for 15 minutes.
  Meanwhile, bring the remaining 2 cups of stock to a simmer in a small
  saucepan and keep it barely simmering over low heat. Pour 1 cup of
  the simmering stock into the casserole and bake for 15 minutes
  longer. Pour in the remaining stock and transfer the casserole to the
  upper third of the oven. Continue baking for another 30 minutes, then
  remove the casserole from the oven, cover tightly with a lid or foil
  and let it rest at room temperature for about
       20    minutes.
    To unmold and serve, run a sharp knife around the inside edges of
  the casserole to loosen the biram ruzz and let it rest for 10 minutes
  longer. Place a heated serving platter upside down over the top, and,
  grasping the casserole and platter together firmly, quickly invert
  them. The biram ruzz should slide out easily. Serve at once.

      Title: BIRDS IN THE NEST
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Brown sugar
      1 c  Butter or shortening
      2    Eggs, separated
      2 tb Water
      2 c  Unsifted flour
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 pn Salt
    1/2 c  Ground nuts
           Jelly-your favorite flavor
 
   These cookies have been a "must" on my family's holiday table since
  I was a little girl. My earliest memories of "birds in the nest" take
  me back to my maternal grandmother's house where she filled each
  "nest" according to the favorite jelly flavor of each of her
  grandchildren.
  
   In a large bowl, cream the sugar and butter or shortening. Add egg
  yolks, water, flour, vanilla and salt. Mix well and compress into a
  ball.
  
   Preheat oven to 350ø.
  
   Break pieces off to form small, walnut-size balls. Dip each ball in
  unbeaten egg whites, then roll in ground nuts. Slightly flatten ball
  to form disk, then press finger in center to form a small well. Fill
  the well with a drop of jelly. (Don't put in to much or it will melt
  over the side of the cookie.)
  
   Bake at 350ø for 15-20 minutes on a greased cookie sheet Remove from
  oven and cool cookies on wire racks.

           Flour and water paste
      2 lb Tomatoes, broiled

      1 c  Onion, finely chopped
    1/2 ts Oregano
 
  The word birria means something deformed or grotesque, and it is used
  col- loquially in the northwest to mean a mess or failure. This
  certainly looks a mess when it is cooked, but it is a very savory one.
  
  It is a really rustic dish.  Usually a whole goat or lamb, although
  in some places just the offal, is seasoned with a paste of ground
  spices and chilies and cooked in a pit barbecue.
  
  One day ahead: There will be approximately 6 to 7 pounds of meat.
  Slash the meats in several places down to the bone and rub the salt
  well into it. Meanwhile, prepare the chili paste. Heat the comal (or
  griddle) and toast the chilies lightly, turning them from time to
  time so that they will not burn.  Remove the veins and seeds. Put the
  chilies to soak in hot water for abt. 20 minutes, then transfer with
  a slotted spoon to the blender jar, add the rest of the ingredients,
  and blend to a smooth sauce. Cover the meat thickly with the paste
  and set it aside to season for about 18 hours.
  
  On serving day: Preheat the oven to 350F. Put the water in the bottom
  of a large Dutch over or casserole with a tightly fitting lid and
  place the meat on a rack so the it is just about the water. Seal the
  lid with a paste of flour and water and cook for about 3 1/2 to 4
  hours, by which time the meat should be almot falling off the bones.
  
  Strain off the juices from the bottom of the pan, cool, and skim off
  the fat.  There should be about 2 cups of juices left-if not, make it
  up with up to 2 cups of water. Blend the tomatoes to a smooth sauce.
  Put the sauce and the skimmed juices from the meat into a saucepan
  and bring to a boil.
  
  Serve each portion of mixed meats in a deep bowl. pour 1/2 cup of
  sauce over the meat and sprinkle with the chopped onion and oregano.
  Eat with tortillas. Makes 8 to 10 servings.

 Categories: Appetizers, Mexican, Lamb
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8    To 10 servings
 
  It is a really rustic dish. Usually a whole goat or lamb, although in
  some places just the offal, is seasoned with a paste of ground spices
  and chiles and cooked in a pit barbecue. As you wander around
  Guadalajara at night, you can see that tacos of birria head the list
  of antojitos on the street-side stands and always appear prominently
  on the Sunday menus of the smaller regional restaurants. Here is a
  family version of birria, with the variety of chiles used in
  Zacatecas, rather than the plain chilacate or ancho used in Jalisco.
  
  One day ahead: 2 lamb shanks A veal breast A lamb breast 3 pounds
  loin of pork 2 tbs salt 6 chiles anchos 3 chiles guajillos 10 chiles
  cascabel 18 peppercorns                    4 whole cloves 1/4 tsp
  oregano Scant 1/4 tsp cumin seeds 1/4 cup vinegar 2 tsp salt 6 cloves
  garlic, peeled 1/2 small onion Directions: There will be
  approximately 6 to 7 pounds of meat. Slash the meats in several
  places down to the bone and rub the salt well into it. Meanwhile,
  prepare the chili paste. Heat the comal and toast the chiles lightly,
  turning them from time to time so that they will not burn. Remove the
  veins and seeds. Put the chiles to soak in hot water for about 20
  minutes, then transfer with a slotted spoon to the blender jar, add
  the rest of the ingredients, and blend to a smooth sauce. Cover the
  meat thickly with the paste and set it aside to season for about 18
  hours.
  
  On serving day: 1 1/2 cups water The meat Flour and water paste 2
  pounds tomatoes, broiled 1 cup onion, finely chopped 1/2 tsp oregano
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Put the water into the bottom of a
  large Dutch oven or casserole with a tightly fitting lid and place
  the meat on a rack so that it is just above the water. Seal the lid
  with a paste of flour and water and cook for about 3 1/2 to 4 hours,
  by which time the meat should be almost falling off the bones. Strain
  off the juices from the bottom of the pan, cool, and skim off the
  fat. There should be about 2 cups of juices left- if not, make it up
  to 2 cups with water. Blend the tomatoes to a smooth sauce. Put the
  sauce and the skimmed juices from the meat into a saucepan and bring
  to a boil. Serve each portion of mixed meats in a deep bowl. Pour 1/2
  cup sauce over the meat and sprinkle with the chopped onion and

      3 tb Sweet sherry
      1    Egg
      3 c  Flour
      2 ts Baking powder
      2 ts Anise seed crushed
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 ts Cinnamon
 
  Heat oven to 350 degrees. Mix sugar and margarine, sherry and egg in a
  large bowl. Stir in the remaining ingredients except the 1/4 cup
  sugar and the cinnamon. Divide dough into two balls. Roll out each
  ball to 1/4 inch thick and cut into any shape with cookie cutters.
  Place on ungreased sheet. Mix together the sugar and cinnamon and
  sprinkle on the cookies before baking. Bake 10-12 minutes until
  golden.
  
  These cookies are cute made into a cactus shape. Pinch off balls of
  dough, one larger than a quarter and 2 the size of a nickel. Roll
  each of the balls between your palms to make cigar shape. Flatten the
  large one to make the main stem of the cactus. Bend one third of each
  of the two smaller ones to make a J shape and attach them at uneven
  intervals on each side to make the "arms". Flatten them to match the
  trunk and bake.
  
  Let you daughter taste the anise first.  Often children do not like
  it as much as adults.  If your daughter does not like the anise
  flavor simply substitute cinnamon oil or flavoring.  It is very
  popular in Mexico.

      2 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Baking soda
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
      1    Egg white
 
  The "Bis" means twice and "Cotti" means cooked --- and our recipe for
  these crisp, cruncy cookies does just that. They are best when dipped
  in hot coffee, cocoa or milk for a few seconds until softened, then
  eaten right away.
  
  Preheat oven to 400^.  Toast nuts until browned, about
        8    minutes; let cool.
  
  Use metal blade in food processor work bowl to finely chop zest and
  granulated sugar, about 60 seconds.  Add brown sugar, extracts,
  margarine and eggs; process until combined, about 5 seconds. Add nuts
  and dry ingredients and pulse until combined, about 12 times.
  
  Transfer dough to floured surface; roll into two 12" logs. Pat logs
  to 2 1/2" wide.  Place 3" apart on lightly greased baking sheets.
  Beat egg white slightly and brush over surface of logs. Bake 20
  minutes until firm and lightly browned.  Remove from oven; reduce
  heat to 325^. While still warm, cut logs diagonally into 1/2" slices,
  lay cut side down on sheets. Bake 15 minutes more until dry. Cool on

      Title: BISCOTTI ALL'ANICE
 Categories: Cookies, Italian
      Yield: 48 Servings
 
      3    Eggs
      2 ts Anise extract
    3/4 c  Sugar
      1 pn Salt
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
    1/2 ts Baking powder
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Combine the eggs, extract, sugar and salt in a
  mixing bowl or the bowl of an electric mixer and whip with a hand
  mixer set at high speed or in a heavy duty mixer fitted with the
  whip. Continue whipping until the mixture is very light and increased
  in volume, 6-7 minutes. While the egg mixture is whipping, combine
  the flour, cornstarch and baking powder and stir to mix. Remove the
  whipped eggs from the mixer and sift over the flour mixture in three
  additions, folding it in after each addition with a rubber spatula.
  The batter will lose most of its air and become rather stiff. Pipe
  the batter, using a pastry bag with a 3/4-inch opening, but no tube,
  onto a jelly roll pan lined with parchment paper or buttered wax
  paper. Pipe two logs about 1 1/2 inches wide and the length of the
  pan. Bake the logs about 20 minutes, until they are well risen and
  golden. Remove from oven and place logs on a cutting board to cool
  about 10 minutes. Using a sharp, serrated knife, slice the logs
  diagonally at 1/2-inch intervals. Place the biscotti cut side down on
  the pan and return them to the oven for about 10-15 minutes, until
  they color lightly on the cut surfaces. Cool the biscotti on the pans
  and store them in a tin between layers of wax paper.

  "Did Columbus and his crews sail to the new world eating these
  traditional Ligurian biscotti? It's entirely possible, although
  theirs would have been cooked much longer to drive off all the
  moisture, allowing them to keep for an entire ocean crossing. Though
  these biscotti are made with an enriched bread dough instead of the
  traditional cookie dough and have a somewhat softer texture, they
  keep well when stored in an airtight container."
  
  Make the sponge: In the bowl of an electric mixer proof the yeast in
  the water for 5 minutes, or until the mixture is foamy. Whisk in the
  flour and let the sponge stand, covered with plastic wrap, for 30
  minutes or until it is foamy.
   To the sponge, add the sugar, the water and the butter and stir the
  mixture until it is combined well. Add the flour, the aniseed, and
  the salt and with the electric mixer fitted with the dough hook knead
  the dough for 3 minutes, or until it is smooth but still sticky.
  Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, turning it to coat it
  with the oil, and let it rise, covered tightly with plastic wrap, for
  1 1/2 hours, or until it is double in bulk.
    Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, halve it, and
  with floured hands form each piece of dough into a flattish log 15
  inches long and 2 inches wide. Transfer the logs to a buttered and
  floured baking sheet and let them rise, covered with a kitchen towel,
  for 2 hours, or until they are double in bulk.
    Bake the logs in the middle of a preheated 350F oven for 30
  minutes, or until they are golden brown, and let them cool on the
  baking sheet on a rack for 10 minutes. On a cutting board cut the
  logs crosswise on the diagonal into 1 inch thick slices, arrange the
  biscotti, cut sides down, on the baking sheet and bake them in the
  350F oven for 10 minutes on each side, or until they are pale golden.
  Transfer the biscotti to racks to cool and store them in airtight
  containers. MAKES:ABOUT 30 BISCOTTI

      Title: BISCOTTI DI CONSUOLO (CONSOLATION BISCUITS)
 Categories: Ethnic, Cookies, Desserts
      Yield: 36 Cookies
 
      2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
      1 lg Egg
    1/2 c  Honey
    1/4 c  Mild olive oil; or
           -melted butter
 
   Although these biscuits have an unhappy association, they are tender
  and tasty. The name refers to the time during which a bereaved family
  receives callers and serves them these biscotti with a glass of wine.
  In Campania and the Basilicata, these customs survive in
  out-of-the-way mountain villages that still cling to ancient
  traditions.
  
   Combine the flour, salt, and baking powder in a mixing bowl. Combine
  the egg, honey and olive oil or butter in a bowl, beat to mix, and
  pour into the flour mixture. Stir well to form a firm dough. Remove
  the dough from the bowl to a floured surface and knead well, about 2
  or 3 minutes. Flour the dough lightly, wrap in plastic, and allow to
  rest at room temperature about 1 hour. Unwrap the dough, cut it into
  12 pieces, and roll each piece into a rope about 1/4 inch in diameter
  x 12 inches long. Divide each rope into three pieces. Join the ends
  and form each piece into a figure eight, making sure that the seam
  lies at the midpoint of the figure eight and underneath it.
   Transfer the biscotti to parchment lined cookie sheets and bake them
  in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes, until puffed and
  light golden.
  
   Cool the biscotti on a rack and store in a tin between sheets of wax
  paper. Makes 3 dozen.

      Title: BISCOTTI DI PRATO (LITTLE ALMOND COOKIES)
 Categories: Desserts, Cookies, Italian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 oz Almonds, blanched
      6 oz Almonds, unblanched
      4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
  1 3/4 c  Granulated sugar
      3    Extra-large eggs
      1 pn Salt
      1 pn Ground saffron
      1 ts (scant) baking soda
      1    Extra-large egg white
 
  Preheat the oven to 375F.  Place both the blanched and unblanched
  almonds on a cookie sheet and toast in the preheated oven for 15
  minutes, until golden brown. Grind 4 ounces of mixed blanched and
  unblanched almonds very fine, then cut the remaining toasted almonds
  into two or three pieces each. Place the flour on a pasta board in a
  mound and make a well in the center. Put the sugar and eggs in the
  well. Mix the sugar and eggs together well, then add the salt,
  saffron, and baking soda. Mix thoroughly and when all the ingredients
  in the well are well integrated, incorporate the flour little by
  little, until all but about 2 tablespoons is incorporated. Set the
  leftover flour aside. Knead the dough for 10 to 15 minutes, then add
  the very finely ground almonds and the almond pieces. Knead for 2 to
  3 minutes more, incorporating the remaining flour. Divide the dough
  into 8 pieces.  With your hands, shape each piece into a long, thin
  roll about 3/4 inch in diameter, then place, widely apart on a
  buttered and floured cookie sheet.  Beat the egg white slightly in a
  small bowl and lightly coat the tops of the 8 rolls with it, using a
  pastry brush, then put the baking sheet into the preheated oven for
  18 to 20 minutes. Remove the rolls from the oven (they will expand in
  size sideways) and cut them with a long slicing knife at a 45-degree
  angle every 3/4 inch to get the shape required for this type of
  little cookie, or biscotti. Place the biscotti back in the oven, this
  time at 275F, for 35 to 45 minutes. They will be very dry. NOTE:
  These cookies are much better eaten after 2 or 3 days, when they have
  softened a little; keep them in a paper bag. If you wish to keep them
  indefinitely, transfer after a week to a jar or can. Serves 8 to 10.

      Title: BISCOTTI DI PRATTO
 Categories: Breads, Italian
      Yield: 6 Dozen
 
    1/4 c  Almonds, blanched
    3/4 c  Almonds, whole unblanched
      4    Eggs, divided
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/4 ts Almond extract
  2 1/4 c  Flour
      1 c  Sugar, white
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 pn Salt
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. On a baking sheet, roast blanched and
  unblanched almonds until blanched almonds start to brown, shaking pan
  occasionally; 5 to 8 minutes. Remove blanched almonds, place in
  blender container and grind until it turns to powder. Set aside.
  Meanwhile, return whole almonds to oven 2 to 3 minutes longer. Remove
  and chop whole almonds roughly with knife, leaving large chunks. Set
  aside. Turn oven down to 300 degrees. Grease baking sheet & dust with
  flour; set aside. In a small bowl, beat 3 eggs, vanilla & extract. In
  large bowl, mix together flour, sugar, baking soda, salt and ground
  almonds. Make a well in the center and add the eggs, blending to
  gradually incor- porate all of flour mixture. You should have a stiff
  dough. If it is too stiff to hold together, add a little water.  Add
  the crushed almonds and knead them evenly into the dough. Divide
  dough into 3 portions. Form each into a long log, rounded or slightly
  oval (about 1 1/2 inches in dia- meter). It will flatten as it bakes.
  Place on prepared baking sheet. Bake 45 - 50 minutes. Remove from
  oven and let rest 5 minutes. Turn oven down to 275 degrees. With a
  serrated knife, cut logs into 3/4" slices. (NOTE: Unlike slicing a
  loaf of bread, straight across its width, cut biscotti on a 45 degree
  angle.) Lay slices flat on 2 baking sheets. Return to oven for 20 -
  25 minutes, turning slices 1/2 way through baking time. Remove from
  oven; allow to cool completely before sealing in containers. They
  will stay fresh up to 1 month.

      Title: BISCOTTI NAPOLETANI
 Categories: Cookies, Italian
      Yield: 60 Servings
 
      2 c  All-purpose flour
    3/4 c  Sugar
    3/4 c  Almonds, whole, unblanched
           -finely ground
    1/2 ts Bicarbonate of ammonia; -OR-
    1/2 ts - Baking powder _AND_
    1/2 ts - Baking soda
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    3/4 c  Almonds, whole, unblanched
    1/3 c  Honey
    1/3 c  Water
 
  Be careful with the first baking of these biscotti. Even though they
  are baked a second time after being cut, if they do not bake
  sufficiently the first time, the biscotti will have a hard, heavy
  core.
  
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Combine all ingredients except honey and water
  in a mixing bowl and stir a minute or 2 to mix. Add the honey and
  water and stir until a firm dough forms. Remove dough from bowl and
  divide in half. Roll each half into a log about 15 inches long. Place
  both logs, well apart, on a jelly roll pan lined with parchment or
  buttered wax paper. Bake about 30 minutes, until well risen, firm and
  a dark golden color. Remove from oven, cool logs slightly and place
  on a cutting board. Slice the logs diagonally at 1/2-inch intervals.
  Return the cut biscotti to the pan, cut side down, and bake an
  additional 15 minutes, until lightly colored and dry. Cool on the
  pan. Store in a tin--they keep well.

      Yield: 12 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------CREPES--------------------------------
      2 c  Biscuit Baking Mix
  1 1/2 c  Milk
      4    Eggs

MMMMM--------------------------BLINTZES-------------------------------
      2 c  Biscuit baking mix
  1 1/2 c  Milk
      2 tb Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla
      4    Eggs

    1/4 c  Sour cream
      2 tb Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla
 
  :       Making crepes can be easy if you already have a batch of
  baking mix in the pantry.  Flipping and filling takes some practice,
  but you'll get it down. Make sure your pan is hot enough to bounce a
  drop of water, and has no rough spots.
  :       Crepes can be filled with various meat stuffings for a quick
  brunch or dinner, or they are great with fruit for dessert. You can
  make a batch of them and freeze them with wax paper or plastic wrap
  between each one.
  
  QUICK CREPES: Combine ingredients and beat until smooth in a blender,
  food processer or shaker container. Mixture will be thin.
  
  ~To Use
  :       For each crepe, ppour about 1/4 cup of batter into a hot,
  greased pan.  Turn pan until batter covers the bottom and cook over
  medium heat until golden brown. Loosen edge with a spatula, trn over
  and cook the other side unitl golden brown.
  :       To reheat frozen crepes: either thaw, still wraped, at room
  temp for 1 hour before warming in an oven set at 350, or nwrap and
  place in a micowave on medium for 1 or 2 minutes.
  
  ~Ideas
  :       For dinner or brunch crepes, try filling with a spoonful of
  finely ground tuna, chicken, or turkey salad and top with white sauce.
  :       For dessert, fill with spiced apples, sweetened cherres or
  berries; top with swetened whipped cream and dust with cinnamon.
  
  BLINTZES:
  
  Mix batter and cook, as for crepes.  Fill the crepe while still warm
  with sweetened cream cheese, top with sour cream, and dust with more
  sugar.

      Title: BISCUIT BONANZA
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  ~----------BISCUIT BONANZA------------------------------------- In
  France, dessert is often constructed from towers of flaky puff
  pastry, and in the Middle East, paper-thin phyllo dough is either
  left crispy or made soggy with syrup. But the U.S. has biscuits to
  call its own. Biscuits--moist, tender and rich--are used as an
  alternative to a yeast-leavened bread. Biscuits are closer in
  technique to making pie crust than to making bread. The steps follow
  the same order: Cut the shortening into the flour mixture, add some
  liquid and roll it out. Once you've mastered the technique, you can
  not only delight in the aroma of biscuits browning for breakfast, you
  can also bake scones for a proper English tea. (The difference is
  there are eggs in scones and not in biscuits). Biscuits are similar
  to real shortcakes, rather than the hockey pucks made from cellulose
  sponges found next to the red glop in the produce department. And you
  can crown fresh fruit with a biscuit dough topping and call it a
  cobbler. Start by sifting the dry ingredients ~-flour, baking powder
  or soda, salt, sugar and so forth. Then cut in the butter or
  shortening until the mixture resembles a fine meal, like breadcrumbs.
  While a wire-blade pastry blender is useful, you can use two knives,
  pulse a food processor fitted with the steel blade on and off a few
  times, or use your fingertips. The third step is adding the liquid.
  The trick is to accomplish this quickly, so that the ingredients are
  just blended enough to hold together. It's tempting to do more, but
  that's what makes biscuits or their first cousins tough. Once liquid
  is added to flour the gluten formation begins, and any agitation
  intensifies this process. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured
  surface, such as a counter or a pastry board, and use the same
  restraint that went into adding the liquid. Don't knead it more than
  10 times, just enough to give it a push in the oven, but not enough
  to make it chewy. Now either roll or pat the dough into the proper
  thickness. The dough should be less than 1 in thick. Cut it into
  desired shapes. No fancy cutters? Use juice cans (a 2 in diameter) or
  an upside down glass.

  circle. Mix all of the remaining ingredients except the oil. Sprinkle
  one eighth of the mixture over half of each circle, leaving 1/2 inch
  of the edge clear. Fold the other half of dough over filling to make
  a half moon; use fork tines to press edges firmly together and seal.
  Coat a nonstick baking pan with cooking spray and arrange the
  calzones in a single layer, not touching.  Brush tops lightly with
  olive oil. Bake until golden, 10 to 12 minutes.

MMMMM----------------------BISCUIT TOPPING---------------------------
      2 c  All-purpose flour
      1    Tablspoon baking powder
      2 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
  6 1/2 tb Cold butter
    3/4 c  Buttermilk
 
  Make the gumbo: In a heavy medium skillet, combine 3 tablespoons of
  the oil with the flour and cook over moderatly low heat, stirring
  occasionally, until the roux is dark mahogany in color, about 1 hour.
  Do not let burn. Immediately remove from heat.
  
  In a medium flameproof casserole, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter
  with the remaining 1 teaspoon oil. Add the sliced sausage and cook
  over moderate heat until well browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a
  plate with a slotted spoon. Add the ham strips to the casserole and
  cook until lightly browned, about 7 minutes; add to the plate with
  the sausage slices.
  
  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and the onion to the casserole.
  Cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until softened and
  translucent, about 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to moderately low and
  add the garlic, green and red bell peppers, celery and rice. Cook,
  stirring, for 5 minutes longer.
  
  Reheat the brown roux if necessary. Scrape it into the casserole with
  the vegetables and rice. Stir in the chicken stock and lemon juice.
  Bring to a boil over high heat. Add the sausages and ham, reduce the
  heat to moderately low and cook, covered, for 25 minutes.
  
  Stir in the cayenne, shrimp and okra and season with salt and black
  pepper to taste. Cook, stirring once or twice, for 2 minutes. Remove
  from the heat.
  
  Make the topping: Preheat the oven to 450F. In a medium bowl, combine
  the flour, baking soda and salt. Cut in the 5 1/2 tablespoons of the
  butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the
  buttermilk until a soft dough forms.
  
  On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough 1/2 inch thick.
  Using a 2 1/2 inch round cutter, stamp out 12 biscuits.
  
  Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Pour the hot gumbo into a
  shallow 9 inch round baking dish. Arrange the bicuits on top and
  brush with the melted butter. Bake until the biscuits are puffed and
  golden brown, about 20    minutes. Typos By Jim Kirk -

      Title: BISCUITS SUPREME
 Categories: Biscuits
      Yield: 12 Scones
 
      2 c  Flour
      4 ts Baking powder
      2 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Cream of tartar
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Shortening
    2/3 c  Milk
 
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Stir together the flour, baking
  powder, sugar, cream of tartar and salt. Cut in the shortening until
  the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
  
  Make a well in the center.  Pour in the milk all at once. Stir just
  until dough clings together; NO MORE.
  
  Knead gently on a lightly floured surface for 10-12 strokes. Roll or
  pat to about 1/2-inch thickness. Cut with a (about) 2 1/2-inch
  biscuit cutter, dipping the cutter into flour before each cut.
  
  Transfer to an ungreased baking sheet.  Bake in a 450 degrees F oven
  for 10-12 minutes, or until golden.
  
  Lots of cookbooks tell you to use two knives, or some such, to do the
  cutting-in of the first step.  Forks work fine for me (I'm a klutz.)
  
  All of the trick to making light, fluffy biscuits is in how you handle
  them: THE LESS, THE BETTER. You can make these as drop biscuits (skip
  the rolling; drop batter by tablespoons, and bake); they're even
  better for the lack of handling.
  
  Outside North America you might not know what shortening is. Use
  butter, margarine, copha or lard. Vegetable shortening really is
  better for this recipe, but don't forget lots of butter to put *on*
  them.... I make these for study breaks. They disappear at an
  exponential rate....
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Simple, fluffy biscuits -- This originated in "The Better Homes and
  Gardens Cookbook," which I consider basic equipment for genteel

      Title: BISHOP HILL CORN FRITTERS
 Categories: None
      Yield: 18 Fritters
 
      2 lg EGGS
    1/4 c  MILK
    1/4 c  WATER
      1 tb BUTTER, melted
     16 oz Can WHOLE KERNEL CORN,
           -drained (I use the drained
           -juices instead of the water
           -or add water to the juice
           -to make 1/4 cup)
      2 c  ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR
      2 ts BAKING POWDER
    3/4 ts SALT
    1/4 ts BLACK PEPPER, freshly ground
      1 tb GRANULATED SUGAR
           VEGETABLE OIL (for frying)
           CONFECTIONERS' SUGAR & MAPLE
           -SYRUP
 
  * Instead of canned corn, 2 cups fresh or frozen corn can be
  substituted. The original recipe does call for canned corn, as
  fritters were considered a winter dish. And this recipe is much older
  than frozen technology.
  
  In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs until light. Add the milk (or corn
  liquid mixed with water), and butter; blend. Stir in the corn and mix
  thoroughly. Add the dry ingredients and mix just until moistened.
  
  Heat 2 inches of oil in an electric skillet or deep-fryer to
  350-degreesF. Drop the batter into the oil by tablespoonfuls and fry
  2 to 3 minutes on each side or until nicely browned. Drain on paper
  towel and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Serve with maple syrup.

      3 tb Sherry, sweet
      1    Egg
      3 c  Flour
      2 ts Baking powder

      1 ts Anise oil
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 ts Cinnamon
 
  Heat oven to 350 degrees. Mix sugar and margarine, sherry and egg in a
  large bowl. Stir in the remaining ingredients except the 1/4 cup
  sugar and the cinnamon. Divide dough into two balls. Roll out each
  ball to 1/4 inch thick and cut into any shape with cookie cutters.
  Place on ungreased sheet. Mix together the sugar and cinnamon and
  sprinkle on the cookies before baking. Bake 10-12 minutes until
  golden.
  
  These cookies are cute made into a cactus shape. Pinch off balls of
  dough, one larger than a quarter and 2 the size of a nickel. Roll
  each of the balls between your palms to make cigar shape. Flatten the
  large one to make the main stem of the cactus.  Bend one third of
  each of the two smaller ones to make a J shape and attach them at
  uneven intervals on each side to make the "arms". Flatten them to
  match the trunk and bake.
  
  Let you daughter taste the anise first. Often children do not like it
  as much as adults. If your daughter does not like the anise flavor
  simply substitute cinnamon oil or flavoring. It is very popular in
  Mexico.

    1/4 c  Sugar
      2 tb Sweet sheery, such as
           - Harvey's Bristol Cream
      2 tb Fresh orange juice

    3/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour

MMMMM--------------------------COATING-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
 
  These are a traditional Mexican cookie and must be made with lard to
  have the right consistency.  So, eat a lot of oat bran the next
  day...don't forgo one of the best cookies you will ever, ever eat.
  Position a rack in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat
  the oven to 350F. In a mixer, whip the lard until it is light and
  creamy. Beat in the sugar, sherry, and orange juice. Beat in the egg
  yolk and then the flour. Roll the dough out between layers of waxed
  paper to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Cut out cookies in whatever shapes
  you wish, transferring them to ungreased baking sheets. Bake them 12
  to 15 minutes, exchanging the position of the sheets on the racks
  from top to bottom and from front to back at the halfway point, until
  the cookies are crisp and lightly colored. For the coating, mix the
  sugar, cinnamon, and cloves in a wide shallow dish (like a pie
  plate).  Carefully dredge the cookies in the spiced sugar while they
  are warm.  Cool completely on a rack.  Store at room temperature in
  airtight tins.

  From The Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook.
  
  " Our black bean soup is a Silver Palate staple.  In this recipe we've
  dressed it up with lots of hot and garlicky sausages, sweet red
  peppers, a bit of brown sugar, and unusual spices. This makes a meal
  when served with a crisp, tart green salad."
  
  Sour cream
  
  1.  Soak the black beans in water to cover overnight.
  
  2.  Heat 1 cup of the oil in a large heavy stock pot over low heat.
  Add the onions and garlic and saute until the onions are limp, about
  10 minutes.
  
  3.  Drain and rinse the beans and add to the stock pot. Add the ham
  bone and 6 quarts of the water. Stir in the cumin, oregano, bay
  leaves, salt, pepper, cayenne, and 3 tablespoons of the parsely. Heat
  to boiling. Reduce heat to medium and cook uncovered at a slow
  rolling boil for 2 hours, skimming foam from the top and stirring
  occasionally to prevent sticking.
  
  4.  Place the garlic sausage in a medium-size saucepan and add the
  remaining 2 quarts water.  Heat to boiling. Reduce heat to low and
  simmer for 40 minutes. Drain. Remove casings and cut into 1/2-inch
  slices.
  
  5.  Heat the remaining 1/4 cup oil in a large heavy skillet over
  medium heat.  Add the Italian sausages and saute until browned.
  Remove the sausages with a slotted spoon.
  
  6.  In the same skillet, saute the bratwurst until browned. Remove
  with a slotted spoon.
  
  7.  After 2 hours of cooking, process 2 cups of the beans in a food
  processor fitted with a steel blade until smooth and return to the
  pot. Continue to cook for 30 minutes.
  
  8.  Add all the sausages and the red peppers and cook for another 30
  minutes.
  
  9.  Remove the ham bone from the soup, shred the meat and return to
  the pot.  Stir in the sherry, sugar, and lemon juice.
  
  10.  Cook over medium heat until the beans are very soft and the soup
  is thick, 30 to 45 minutes.  Stir in the remaining 5 tablespoons
  chopped parsley.  Taste and adjust seasonings.
  
  11.  Ladle the soup into soup bowls and dollop each serving with sour
  cream.
  
  Makes 16 portions.

  remove from heat and allow them to stand covered for 1 hour. Either
  tie the cinnamon stick, garlic and peppercorns in cheesecloth, or
  break the cinnamon stick into small pieces and place all the
  flavoring agents in a tea ball. Bring the beans to a boil and simmer,
  covered, for 30 minutes, or until they are cooked but still slightly
  crunchy. Drain and chill well. Combine the beans with the papaya and
  jicama. For the dressing, peel and mince the garlic and shallots.
  Combine them in a small bowl with the remaining ingredients. Combine
  the dressing with the jicama, papaya and beans. Let the salad sit
  refrigerated for at least 20 minutes before serving. Serves 6. (If
  you can't find jicama, you can use peeled apple.)

    1/2 c  Black beans, soaked
    1/2 md Turnip, cut into rounds &
           -- each round halved
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
      2 lg Carrots, quartered

    1/2 c  Green peas
    1/2 c  Mushrooms, halved
           Salt & pepper
           Water or stock to cover
 
  In the bottom of a large casserole dish, arrange the turnip slices &
  sprinkle with the nutmeg.  Layer the rest of the vegetables in order,
  sprinkling in the herbs after each layer. Top with the soaked beans.
  Pour over enough water or stock to cover & season with salt & pepper.
  Cover with a good tight-fitting lid & place in an oven pre-heated to
  300F. Cook for 3 hours. If you desire, add dumplings & cook for a
  further 30 minutes.
  
  NOTE: I made this recipe to emphaise the taste of the root
  vegetables. Add whatever vegetables & herbs you wish. I used black
  beans to add some protein.  If exchanging legumes, be sure to use
  ones that can stand a lot of cooking, kidney beans or chick peas, for
  example.

      1 ts Tabasco sauce
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
 
  Pick over and rinse the beans. Put them into a large bowl and cover
  completely with cold water.  Let the beans soak overnight (or for at
  least 8 hours). Drain the beans and transfer them to a medium
  saucepan. Add the 2 cups water and the bay leaf. Bring to a boil over

  then spray it twice with the vegetable oil. Add the broccoli stems,
  carrot, celery, and onion. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook
  for 5 minutes, stirring once or twice. Stir in the thyme, basil, and
  wine. Simmer, uncovered, for about 15 minutes, until the wine has
  been reduced by half. In the meantime, coat the chicken thoroughly
  with the barbecue sauce and bake for 10 minutes on the top shelf of
  the oven. Remove the chicken from the oven and allow it to cool just
  long enough to handle.  Cut the chicken into small cubes. Add the
  chicken, chicken stock, and beans to the stockpot. Cook over low heat
  for about 3 minutes, until thoroughly heated.  Stir in the evaporated
  milk and the broccoli florets. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring if needed

  Place a heavy stockpot over medium heat for about 1 minute, then
  spray it twice with the vegetable oil. Add the broccoli stems,
  carrot, celery, and onion. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook
  for 5 minutes, stirring once or twice.  Stir in the thyme, basil, and
  wine. Simmer, uncovered, for about 15 minutes, until the wine has
  been reduced by half.
  
  In the meantime, coat the chicken thoroughly with the barbecue sauce
  and bake for 10 minutes on the top shelf of the oven. Remove the
  chicken from the oven and allow it to cool just long enough to
  handle. Cut the chicken into small cubes.
  
  Add the chicken, chicken stock, and beans to the stockpot. Cook over
  low heat for about 3 minutes, until thoroughly heated. Stir in the
  evaporated milk and the broccoli florets. Cook for 5 minutes,
  stirring if needed to keep the soup from coming to a boil. Add the
  dissolved cornstarch and cook for 2 minutes more, stirring
  constantly. Stir in the liquid smoke, Worcestershire sauce, and
  Tabasco sauce.
  
  Garnish with chopped cilantro.

      Title: BLACK BEAN CHILAQUILES
 Categories: Low fat, Vegetarian, Main dish
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
     12    Corn Tortillas
      1    Onion chopped
     10 fl Stock
      3    Cloves garlic crushed
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/2 ts Ground cumin seed
    1/2 ts Chilli powder
      2 lb Cooked black beans, or 3s
           -cans (14 oz each) kidney
           -beans drained
     15 fl Tomato sauce flavoured with
           -pinch each of cayenne and
           -cumin
      8 oz Mozarella cheese finely d
           -shredded
      6 tb Parmesan cheese
           Chopped fresh coriander
           Lime wedges
 
  1.  Pre-heat oven to 300 degrees F, 150 degrees C, gas mark 2.
  
  2.  Bake the tortillas directly on the oven shelf for 15 to 20
  minutes, turning once until crisp right through. They will break with
  a clean snap. Break into coarse pieces and set aside.
  
  3.  Spread onion pieces out in a heavy frying pan. Cook over moderate
  heat without stirring until the onions are sizzling and beginning to
  stick to the pan. Stir in the stock and let it bubble up, stirring up
  the browned deposits in the pan as it bubbles.  Stir in the garlic
  and the spices. Turn the heat down and simmer, stirring frequently
  until the mixture is thick, not at all soupy, and the onions and
  spices are frying in their own juices. Don't rush this step.  It is
  essential that the spices should not have a harsh raw taste.
  
  4.  Stir in the black beans and heat gently.  Mash roughly while
  still in the pan, with a potato masher. You want a rough lumpy
  mixture, not a smooth puree. Set aside.
  
  5.  In a gratin dish spread a layer of a third of the tortilla pieces.
  Spread a layer of the black beans over the tortillas and spread a
  third of the tomato sauce over the black beans. Sprinkle with one
  third of the cheeses.  Repeat this, ending with a layer of the beans,
  sauce and cheeses.
  
  6.  Bake for 30 minutes covered.  Uncover, and bake for 5 to 10
  minutes more.  Serve garnished with lime wedges.

      2 lg Onions; chopped
      2    Green peppers; chopped
      4    Cloves garlic; minced
      1 lb Beef stew meat; cut into
           -1-inch cubes
      2 lb Boneless pork butt
      1    28-oz can whole tomatoes;
           -reserve liquid
    1/4    To 1/3 cup chili powder
      1    To 2 jalapeno chili peppers;
           -chopped (remove seeds)
      2 tb Ground cumin
        ds Cayenne pepper
           ;salt (optional)
           Freshly ground black pepper
      2 c  Black beans; cooked
    1/2 c  Dry red wine
           Cheddar cheese; grated
           Fresh cilantro; chopped
           Red onions; chopped
           Sour cream
 
  Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add 2 onions, bell
  peppers, and garlic and saute until tender, about 14 minutes. Transfer
  mixture to a bowl using a slotted spoon. Add beef and pork to pan and
  cook over medium-high heat until meat is no longer pink, stirring
  occasionally, approximately 8 minutes or so. Return onion mixture to
  pan. Now add tomatoes with the reserved liquid, chili powder, chili
  peppers, cumin, and cayenne pepper.  Season with salt (optional) and
  pepper. Cover the pan and simmer until beef and pork are just about
  tender (stir the pan every once in a while), about 1 hour.
  
  Add black beans and the wine to chili.  Simmer uncovered until meat is
  tender and the chili begins to thicken. This will probably take about
  25 minutes. When chili is finished, ladle into bowls. Serve with
  cheese, cilantro, red onions and sour cream in separate little bowls.
  
  Judi's notes:  I usually add about 1/4 cup water or beef broth once or
  twice during the cooking process if it appears too dry.

           -=OR=-
      2 oz -Canned green chiles,

           - (or more)
    1/2 c  Creme fraiche or sour cream
      5    Cilantro sprigs
 
  SORT THROUGH THE BEANS and remove any small stones. Rinse them well,
  cover them generously with water, and let them soak overnight. Next
  day, drain the beans, cover them with fresh water by a couple of
  inches and bring them to a boil with the bay leaf. Lower the heat and
  let the beans simmer while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
  Heat a small heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds, and
  when they begin to color, add the oregano leaves, shaking the pan
  frequently so the herbs don't scorch. As soon as the fragrance is
  strong and robust, remove the pan from the heat and add the paprika
  and the cayenne. Give everything a quick stir; then remove from the
  pan--the paprika and the cayenne only need a few seconds to toast.
  Grind in a mortar or a spice mill to make a coarse powder. Preheat
  the oven to 375F. To make the chili powder, put the dried chile in
  the oven for 3-to-5 minutes to dry it out. Cool it briefly; then
  remove the stem, seeds and veins. Tear the pod into small pieces and
  grind it into a powder in a blender or a spice mill. Heat the oil in
  a large skillet and saute the onions over medium heat until they
  soften. Add the garlic, salt and the ground herbs and chili powder
  and cook another 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and their juice. Simmer
  everything together for 15 minutes then add this mixture to the
  beans, and, if necessary, enough water so the beans are covered by at
  least 1-inch. Continue cooking the beans slowly until they are soft,
  an hour or longer, or pressure cook them for 30 minutes at 15 pounds
  pressure. Keep an eye on the water level and add more, if needed, to
  keep the beans amply covered. When the beans are cooked, taste them
  and season to taste with the vinegar, additional salt if needed, and
  the chopped cilantro. Prepare the garnishes. If you are using fresh
  green chiles, roast them over a flame until they are evenly charred.
  Let them steam 10 minutes in a bowl covered with a dish; then scrape
  off the skins, discard the seeds, and dice. Serve the chili ladled
  over a large spoonful of grated cheese and garnish it with the creme
  fraiche or sour cream, the green chilies and a sprig of fresh
  cilantro. Though served in a bowl and eaten with a spoon, this chili
  is a great deal thicker than most soups--thick enough in fact to be
  served on a plate right alongside fritters or cornbread. It also,
  however, can be thinned considerably with stock, water or tomato
  juice to make a thinner but still very flavorful black bean soup.
  When thinned to make a soup, it can be served as part of a meal
  rather than a meal in itself.
  
  This is one of the best-known recipes from the San Francisco
  restaurant Greens.

  minute or so. Pour into the casserole with the meat and vegetables.
  
  Add the tomatoes, water, molasses, sage, and cumin to the pot. Simmer,
  covered, for 1-1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Add the black beans,
  drained if using canned, and season with salt if needed. Cook another
       15    minutes.
  
  Serve: Put a dollop of Cilantro Pesto on each serving, and service the
  garnishes on the side.

      Title: BLACK BEAN FLAN
 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Red Onion Salsa:
    1/2 sm Red onion, very, finely
           -diced
    1/2 bn Flatleaf parsley, leaves
           -only,, coarsely chopped
      2    Plum tomatoes,, coarsely
           -chopped
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Cider vinegar
      1 ts Soy sauce
  1 1/2 c  Cooked black beans
      2 lg Eggs
      1 lg Egg yolk
      1 c  Milk
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      3 ds Tabasco sauce
      3 tb Unsalted butter,, melted
      5 oz Log of goat cheese
    1/2 bn Watercress, tough stems
           -removed,, for garnish
 
  Combine all the ingredients for the salsa in a small glass bowl and
  toss together well. Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 hours. Preheat
  the oven to 350 degrees. In a food processor, pulse 1 cup of the
  black bean until pureed, scraping down the bowl as necessary. In a
  medium mixing bowl, combine the pureed beans with the whole eggs,
  yolk, milk, salt, pepper, and Tabasco. Mix together well until only
  lumps of bean skin are showing. Add the remaining 1/2 cup of whole
  cooked beans and mix together gently until evenly blended. Brush 6
  1/2cup ramekins with the melted butter. Pour very hot water to a
  depth of 1 inch in a roasting pan large enough to hold all the
  ramekins. Place the dishes in the roasting pan and fill them with the
  flan mixture, making sure to add an equal amount of whole beans to
  each cup. Bake for 35 minutes, or until firm in the center. Remove
  from the oven and let cool to room temperature.
  
  Using a length of fishing line or heavy sewing thread held tightly
  between two hands, slice the goat cheese into 6 equal disks and set
  aside at room temperature. When ready to serve, preheat a broiler to
  mediumhigh heat. Run a small knife carefully around the top outside
  edge of each flan and place the ramekins on a baking sheet which will
  fit under the broiler. Turn the ramekins over and tap the bottom
  side of each ramekin to release the flans. Shake them out onto the
  baking sheet and place a disk of goat cheese on top of each. Place
  the baking sheet under the broiler and toast until the goat cheese
  begins to bubble. With a flatended metal spatula, transfer a flan to
  each dinner plate and top with a spoonful of the salsa. Place a few
  sprigs of watercress around the base of each flan and serve
  immediately.

      Title: BLACK BEAN PATTIES
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Cooked black beans
      1 c  Cornmeal
      1 tb Cumin
      1 c  Cooked brown rice
      1 c  Soymilk
 
  The North  American Indians made patties  of black beans and cornmeal,
  cooking  them over campfires. Brown rice has been added to give them
  more substance, though the Native Americans on the plains would have
  used wild rice.  For a main dish,  you can make or buy a mushroom
  gravy to serve over the patties, serving with a green vegetable and
  salad. Uncooked patties can be wrapped in wax paper and frozen, then
  for a quick meal you can defrost and fry or grill. This is a nice way
  to use up leftover rice or beans, but you can also cook some for the
  occasion. For breakfast, you can serve with warm maple syrup.
  
  Cool the  beans and rice,  if you have  just cooked them. Combine all
  the ingredients well.  Add more cornmeal as needed to form a stiff
  dough. Form into patties. Add corn oil to a frying pan and fry, or
  grill over charcoal. Cooking black beans: put 1 cup dry black beans
  in 3 cups water and store overnight (a quart canning jar works well
  for this.) Bring to a boil in fresh  water  and simmer around 40
  minutes. Cooking brown rice: place 1 cup brown rice in 2 1/2 cups
  water. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer until water has
  disappeared, about 35 minutes. Let the rice rest with cover on an
  additional 10 minutes. From: Mary Howard.

  hours. 2. Remove and discard the ham hock and bay leaf.  Using a
  slotted spoon, transfer the bean mixture, in batches, to the bowl of
  a food processor. Process, adding cooking liquid as necessary to form
  a smooth, thick paste. You will use a total of about 1 cup liquid. 3.
  Transfer the pesto to a bowl and stir in the salt and pepper, if
  needed. Refrigerate, covered, until ready to use. This will keep in
  the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days. Makes 3 cups. Author's note:  These
  beans make a hot and spicy spread. Also use them in place of the red
  bean paste in the Three Layer Mexican Dip, or serve them in fajitas
  or on nachos.  Black Bean Pesto can also be heated through and served
  as a side dish, garnished with sour cream and cilantro. Source: The

      Title: BLACK BEAN SAUCE SQUID
 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Squid, cleaned
           -Chinese-style (see below)
      2 tb Fermented, salted black
           -beans (available at Asian
           -groceries)
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      2 tb Rice wine, or 2 Tbs mirin
           -or sherry
      1 ts Ginger, grated
      2    Scallions, chopped into
           -1/2-inch pieces
      1    Tb regular soy sauce
      1 ts Sugar
      1 ts Cornstarch dissolved in
      1 tb Water
      2 tb Vegetable oil
 
  Many people shy away from dishes with names like Black Bean Sauce
  Squid because they think it involves the preparation of a complicated
  sauce. In fact it is quite easy. The black beans themselves,
  fermented and salted when you buy them, are the sauce.  All you do is
  add a little rice wine to make a paste.  Then it's just like any
  other stir-fry++a couple of minutes of high-heat cooking,
  continuously stirring, and the dish is done.
  
  Prepare black bean sauce mixture by adding to the beans: rice wine,
  soy sauce and sugar.  Let sit for
       15    minutes.
  
  Saute garlic and ginger in the oil over medium heat in a heavy frying
  pan or wok until garlic is slightly browned. Turn up heat. Add squid
  and scallions. Stir-fry for 30 seconds. Pour in black bean sauce
  mixture, and cook for 2 minutes.  Add cornstarch and, when sauce
  thickens, remove from heat and serve.
  
  [Score squid diagonally at three quarter inch intervals. Turn and
  repeat at right angles to original cuts. Don't cut all the way
  through the squid body.  Cut each scored squid body into three or
  four pieces. When cooked, the squid will roll up and the
  crosshatching will catch and hold the sauce. It's much easier to do
  than to describe. S.C.]

 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings

      1 c  Water
      2 c  Cooked black beans,
           -reserving some of the
           -cooking liquid
      1 sm Onion, chopped
      2    Cloves crushed garlic
    1/2 ts Cumin
    1/2 ts Oregano
    1/2 ts Basil
    1/2 ts Ginger
      1    Bay leaf
    1/4 ts Red pepper (optional)
    1/4 c  Cheap red wine (optional)
      1    Vegetarian sausage link,
           -crumbled (optional)
           Salt and pepper
      4 oz Shredded sharp
           -cheddar cheese
 
  Prepare the rice in the water according to package directions or your
  own procedure (white rice is OK, but it makes for a bland and fairly
  gummy dish).
  
  While the rice is cooking, combine all the rest of the ingredients
  except the cheese in a saucepan and simmer, at least 15 minutes.
  
  Heat oven to 350 degrees. Spoon the cooked rice into a casserole dish.
  Remove the bay leaf from the bean mixture; pour the beans over the
  rice and stir; it doesn't have to be thoroughly mixed. Top with the
  cheese and bake uncovered 20-35 minutes or until cheese is browned
  and bubbly. Let stand five minutes before serving.
  
  I tell people this serves four, but that's a fairly skimpy serving. It
  doubles easily, but you'll need a pretty good-size casserole. Also,
  the wine is optional for those who don't use it, but it really does
  make a difference, and since the other flavors are pretty assertive,
  I'd suggest using a fairly cheap, strongly flavored wine. Posted By

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Sauce---
      1 c  Chicken stock
     10    Tomatillos (husked) --
           Rinsed and chopped
      4    Cloves garlic

      2 c  Black beans -- cooked
      1    Clove garlic -- minced
      2    Serrano chiles -- seeded and
           Minced
    1/2 c  Mango or papaya -- diced
      4    Scallions (white part only)
           Thinly sliced
    1/2 c  Corn kernels -- roasted
      8 oz Fresh goat cheese --
           Crumbled
           Salt -- to taste
           Vegetable oil -- to soften
           Tortillas
      8    Corn tortillas
      1 c  Mango Relish (separate
           Recipe)
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  To make the sauce, in a saucepan, cook the chicken stock, tomatillos,
  garlic cloves, onions, and serranos over medium-high heat for 10
  minutes, stirring frequently. Transfer the mixture to a blender, add
  the cilantro, and puree until smooth. Season with salt and set aside.
  
  To make the filling, in another saucepan, bring all the filling
  ingredients except the cheese and salt to a boil. Remove from the
  heat, whisk in 4 ounces of the goat cheese, and season with salt.
  Deep warm.
  
  Pour enough of the oil in a skillet to come 1/2 inch up the sides.
  Over medium heat, bring the oil to 350 degrees F. or just smoking.
  (CAUTION: Do This Very Carefully--This is VERY, VERY HOT--) Submerge
  the tortillas in the oil one by one for 5 seconds each to soften.
  Drain the tortillas on paper towels and keep warm: do not stack the
  tortillas.
  
  To assemble the enchiladas, divide the black bean-goat cheese mixture
  evenly among the tortillas, spreading evenly down the middle. Roll up
  the tortillas and place seam side down on a baking sheet or in an
  ovenproof baking dish, placing them snugly together. Pour the
  reserved tomatillo sauce over the enchiladas, and top with the
  remaining 4 ounces of the goat cheese.  Cover with foil and bake in
  the oven for 10 minutes. Serve 2 enchiladas per plate, together with
  Mango Relish (separate recipe).
  
  Chef's Notes:  This recipe is included by chef Stephan Pyles in his
  cookbook __The New Texas Cuisine__, Doubleday, 1993, ($35.00).
  
  The chef states:  "This recipe was published in _Parade_ magazine in
  1987 in an article commissioned by my friend Sheila Lukins...
  Although at first glance this combination may not seem very Texan,
  one only has to realize that the Gulf Coast is subtropical and that
  some of the best goat cheese in the country is made here in Dallas by
  the Mozzarella Company." (He's right!)

      Title: BLACK BEANS IN SPICY TAMARIND SAUCE
 Categories: Indian, Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Mexican black beans
      2 cc Tamarind pulp (see note)
    1/3 c  Peanut oil
      2    Onions, chopped
      2 tb Grated fresh ginger
      2 tb Minced garlic
      1 ts Powdered hot red chile
           -peppers
      1 ts Freshly ground cumin
    1/2 ts Turmeric
      1 lg Ripe tomato, finely chopped
      2 ts Ground roasted cumin seeds
      1 ts Garam masala
           Salt to taste
      1 c  Chopped cilantro leaves
 
  Pick over and wash the beans.  Soak them overnight in cold water to
  cover.
  
  Soak the tamarind pulp in 2 cups hot water in a nonmetallic bowl for
  at least 1 hour.  Squeeze the pulp with fingers to extract as much
  juice as possible.  Strain, pressing the pulp.  Discard the residue
  and reserve the strained juice and pulp.
  
  Heat the oil in a heavy, shallow pan.  Add the onions and cook,
  stirring frequently, until they turn almost reddish brown, 10 to 12
  minutes. Add the ginger and garlic and cook for 5 minutes longer,
  stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the pan.  Add the
  chile pepper, cumin and turmeric, and cook for 10 or 15 seconds. Stir
  in the tomatoes and let them cook until they form a sauce and fat
  separates out.
  
  Drain the beans and add to the pan along with 2 cups water. Cover and
  simmer until the beans are almost done. Check the water level from
  time to time, and if the b@beans look dry, add small amounts of hot
  water.
  
  When the beans have finished cooking, there should be plenty of
  sauce. Stir in the tamarind, cover and simmer until the beans are
  very tender. Stir in the roasted cumin seeds, garam masala, salt and
  1/2 cup of the cilantro leaves.  Cover the pan and let rest for at
  least 10 minutes. Reheat and serve garnished with remaining cilantro
  leaves.
  
  NOTE:  Tamarind is available in cake form at Indian markets.

      Title: BLACK BEANS MENOCAL
 Categories: Beans/peas, Cuba, Update
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea Black beans
      2 lg Green bell peppers
      1 lg Onion
      4 lg Cloves of garlic
    2/3 c  Extra virgin olive oil
      3 ts Salt
    1/2 ea Ground black pepper
    1/2 ea Dry oregano
      1 ea Bay leaf
      2 tb Sugar
      2 tb Red wine vinegar
      2 tb Dry white wine
 
  Wash beans and soak overnight (or about 10 hrs)  in 10 cups water and
  1 bell pepper which has been cut in half and seeded. It is not
  necessary to thow out the soaking water. Bring to a boil then lower
  to med-low and simmer uncovered. Meanwhile, add 1 onion, 1 bell
  pepper, the garlic and olive oil to a food processor or blender and
  process to the consistency of a thick milk shake. Stirfry this green
  puree in a large skillet. Bring puree to a boil then lower to simmer,
  stirring often for 20 minutes. Place 1 cup of drained beans from the
  pot into the skillet with the puree, mash them with a fork and blend
  in with the puree. (You can also add the cup of beans into the
  processor or blender and process for 15 seconds.) Simmer the puree
  with the mashed beans for another 2 minutes. Add entire contents of
  skillet to the pot of cooking black beans. Add the salt, black
  pepper, oregano, bay leaf and 2 tablespoons of the sugar. Cook
  uncovered for 1 hour stirring often to prevent sticking. Now add the
  vinegar and white wine and cook for another 30 minutes. You may leave
  in or discard the bell pepper used in soaking. If you have the time,
  the beans come out better if not served immediately, but left to
  "sleep" overnight in the refridgerator. I can't wait myself, but the
  leftovers are fabulous. Re-heat in the microwave or simmer very
  slowly on the stovetop until ready. Stir often. Before serving add 1
  tbs sugar and 2 tbs. olive oil and blend in. Serve over rice topped
  with finely chopped red or yellow onions. Watch this bulletin board
  as I am in the process of triple-checking the amounts in the
  ingredients section with other family members. But the above is how I
  cook them and they are very good. Let me know how they turn out!

  :          roasted and chopped
        2    egg whites
      1/2 c  canola oil
  :          Sour cream for serving
  :          Salsa for serving
  
  Stir together the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, chili powder,
  cumin, and cayenne in a medium-size bowl.
  
  Beat the milk with the egg yolk, and add it to the dry ingredients,
  mixing well.
  
  Stir in the beans, cheese, corn, cilantro, red pepper, and green
  chilies.
  
  In another bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until
  stiff. Gently fold them into the batter,
  
  Heat the 1/2 cup oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat.
  (Test the heat by dropping a bit of batter into the oil; it should
  immediately sizzle and rise to the top.)
  
  Spoon in about 1/4 cup of batter for each fritter, making three or
  four at a time.  Fry until golden brown on one side, 3 to 5 minutes.
  Turn and fry until golden brown on the other side, and drain on paper
  towels. Fry the rest of the batter in batches.
  
  Serve immediately with sour cream and salsa on the side.
  
  Fritters are best served hot and crispy, right out of the pan.
  
  4 or 5 servings (about 15 fritters)

 Categories: Chocolate, Cakes, Cupcakes
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
     12 oz Cream cheese
      2    Eggs
  1 2/3 c  Sugar
     10 oz Semisweet chocolate chips
  1 1/2 c  Flour -- sifted
    1/4 c  Cocoa powder
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Water
    1/3 c  Cooking oil
      1 tb Vinegar
      1 ts Vanilla
 
  INSTRUCTIONS: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Arrange 24 cupcake liners
  in muffin tins or liberally grease a cake/bundt pan. Blend together
  the cream cheese, eggs and 2/3 cup of the sugar in a large bowl. Stir
  in the chocolate chips. Sift the remaining sugar, the flour, cocoa,
  baking soda and salt into a mixing bowl. Stir in the water, oil,
  vinegar and vanilla; beat until smooth. Fill cupcake liners 1/3 full
  with the chocolate batter; spoon the cheese mixture on top. If using
  a cake or bundt pan, scrape the batter into the pan, then top with
  several layers of the cream cheese topping, spreading it thinly
  because it will sink in deeper after each application. Bake until the
  cakes test done -- 30 to 35 minutes for cupcakes, 40 to 45 minutes
  for cake. Let cool 10 minutes before turning out on wire racks to
  cool completely.

  4 1/4 c  Flour, cake
      4 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Nutmeg, grated
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
      2 c  Butter, sweet; softened
     10 lg Egg
      1 tb Vanilla
  1 1/2 c  Almond paste; if desired

      2 lb Sugar, confectioners; sifted
      6 lg Egg white; room temp
      2 tb Lemon juice
           Drages; for decoration
 
  In a large bowl, mix all the fruits thoroughly with the wine and the
  rum; let the fruit macerate, covered, at room temperature for at
  least two weeks. In a heavy skillet combine one pound of the brown
  sugar and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil over moderate heat, stirring
  until the sugar is dissolved, and gently boil the syrup, swirling the
  skillet occasionally, for a few minutes, or until it is reduced to 1
  3/4 cups. Let the syrup cool; reserve. Sift the flour, baking powder,
  cinnamon and nutmeg together into a bowl. In the large bowl of an
  electric mixer cream together the remaining brown sugar and the
  butter until it is fluffy; then beat in the eggs, one at a time,
  beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla, the flour
  mixture, and 1 1/3 cups of the burnt sugar syrup, reserving the
  remaining syrup for another use. In another large bowl, combine well
  the flour mixture and the fruit mixture and divide the batter between
  two buttered and floured 10" springform pans. Bake the cakes in the
  middle of a preheated 350 F. oven for two hours, or until a toothpick
  inserted in the centers comes out with some crumbs adhering to it.
  (The centers of these cakes will be quite moist.)  Let the cakes cool
  in the pans on a rack, remove the sides and bottoms of the pans, and
  wrap the cakes in foil or wax paper. Let the cakes stand at room
  temperature for a week. Roll out half the almond paste between sheets
  of plastic wrap to form a 10" round and remove the top sheet of
  plastic wrap. Fit the almond paste layer over one cake, trimming the
  edge if necessary, and remove the other sheet of plastic wrap.  Roll
  out and fit the remaining almond paste onto the remaining cake in the
  same manner. ICING: Using an electric mixer, beat 4 cups of the
  confectioners' sugar with the egg whites and lemon juice until the
  mixture will hold a soft peak. Beat in the remaining sugar, and beat
  the icing until it will hold a stiff peak. Transfer two cups of the
  icing to a pastry bag fitted with a decorative tip, spread the
  remaining icing on the tops and sides of the cakes with a long metal
  spatula, and pipe the icing in the pastry bag decoratively onto the
  cakes. Arrange the drages on the cakes. Makes two cakes.

      Title: BLACK CHOCOLATE ZINGER
 Categories: Cakes, Chocolate
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
    3/4 c  Water
      1 tb Instant coffee granules
      6 oz Unsweetened chocolate,
           Coarsely chopped
      3 tb Honey
      2 c  Sifted unbleached
           All-purpose flour
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 ts Freshly ground
           Black pepper
      8 tb (1 stick) unsalted butter,
           Softened & cut into 1"pieces
    1/4 c  Solid vegetable shortening
      2 c  Superfine granulated sugar
      4 lg Eggs, at room temperature
      2 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 c  Ice water

MMMMM-----------------------GANACHE GLAZE----------------------------
      2    3-oz bars Swiss Dark
           Chocolate, such as Lindt
      6 oz Heavy cream
      1 tb Light corn syrup
      1 tb Grand Marnier, Cointreau
           Or dark rum
    3/4 ts Vanilla extract
      1 ts Hot water, if needed
 
  MAKE THE CAKE: 1. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and
  preheat to 350 degrees.  Butter a 12 cup fluted tube pan. Dust with
  flour and tap out the excess. 2. In a small saucepan, bring the 3/4
  cup water to a boil. Immediately remove from the heat and stir in the
  coffee until disolved.  Add the chocolate and honey and whisk until
  the chocolate is melted and the mixture thickens. Let cool for 10 to
  15 minutes, until tepid. 3. In a medium bowl, using a wire whisk,
  stir together the flour, baking soda, salt and pepper, until
  throughly blended. 4. In a 4 1/2 quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric
  mixer using the paddle attachment, beat the butter at medium speed
  for 30 to 45 seconds, until creamy and smooth. Add the vegetable
  shortening. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat for 30 seconds
  longer. 5. Add the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, taking 8 to 10
  minutes to blend well.  If using a hand mixer, take at least 15
  minutes to blend well. Scrape the sides of the bowl occasionally. 6.
  Add the eggs, one at a time at 1 minute intervals.  Reduce the speed
  to medium. Stir the chocolate/honey mixture once or twice, then add
  to the batter along with the vanilla, scraping the side of the bowl
  as necessary. Beat 30 seconds longer. 7.  At low speed, one-third at
  a time, beat in the flour mixture alternately with the ice water. Mix
  briefly just until each addition is barely incorporated into the
  batter.  Scrape down the side of the bowl and mix the batter 10 more
  seconds. 8. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the
  surface with the back of a spoon. Center the pan on the rack and bake
  for 65 to 75 minutes, until the cake begins to come away from the
  side of the pan and a wooden toothpick inserted into the center comes
  out clean. 9. Set the cake onto a wire rack to cool for 15 to 20
  minutes. Invert the cake onto the rack and remove the pan. Cool
  completely. MAKE THE GANACHE GLAZE: 10. Break the chocolate bars into
  1-inch pieces and place them in a food processor fitted with the
  metal chopping blade. Process for 15 to 25 seconds, until finely
  chopped. Empty the chocolate into a medium bowl. 11. In a small
  saucepan, heat the cream and corn syrup on low heat until it comes to
  a gentle boil. Immediately pour the hot cream over the chocolate.
  Let the mixture stand for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Gently
  whisk until smooth.  Stir in the liqueur or rum and vanilla. If the
  surface is oily, stir in 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of hot water. 12. Put the
  wire rack with the cake over a baking sheet.  Pour the chocolate
  glaze over the top of the cake.  Let the glaze drip down the sides of
  the cake without coating it completely. Lift up the rack with the
  cake and transfer it to another baking sheet.  Put the baking sheet
  with the cake in the refrigerator to chill for 5 to 10 minutes to set
  the glaze. 13. Store the cake at room temperature under a glass cover
  or in an airtight container for up to 5 days.

  Most of us tend to think of olives as a salty-fatty food. But it's
  possible to buy low salt black olives, featured in the Mediterranean
  style sauce, that have all the good flavor without all of the salt.
  Yes, the capers that lend spark to the sauce are themselves salty;
  but you can cut down on their saltiness by choosing a brand that
  ranks salt further down, and thus in lesser concentration-on the
  ingredients list,and then draining and rinsing the capers well before
  adding them. Serve with medium to large strands, ribbons, or shapes.
  
  broken by hand or chopped into about 4 pieces each 3 tbsp capers,
  drained and rinsed 1 tbsp balsamic or good quality red wine vinegar 1
  tbsp double concentrate tomato paste 2 tsp sugar 1/2 tbsp dried
  oregano
  
  In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the olive oil with the garlic and
  onion over moderate heat.  When they sizzle, add the tomatoes,
  breaking them up with your hands. Then stir in the remaining
  ingredients. Simmer the sauce until it is thick but still slightly
  liquid, 5-7 minutes. Serve over cooked pasta. Serves 4.

  "This recipe descends from ne of the oldest known kinds of pizza
  crust. The Romans, who were very fond of black pepper, used a similar
  but richer dough, which included eggs and honey. Naturally rendered
  pork lard is essential to this crust.  If you can't get any, use the
  same amount of olive oil in the recipe."
  
  1.  Pour the water into a medium-sized mixing bowl and sprinkle in the
  yeast. Stir gently with a fork until the yeast has dissolved and the
  liquid turns light beige in color.
  
  2.  Add 1 cup of the flour, the salt, pepper and lard. Mix thoroughly
  with a wooden spoon.  Add a second cup of flour to the bowl and mix
  well. After the second cup of flour has been mixed in, the dough
  should start coming away from the sides of the bowl and should begin
  to form a soft,sticky mass.
  
  3.  Measure out the third cup of flour.  Sprinkle some over the work
  surface and flour your hands generously. Remove all of the dough from
  the bowl and begin to work the mass by kneading the additional flour
  in a bit at a time.
  
  4.  To knead the dough, use the heel of your hands to push the dough
  across the floured work surface in one sweep. Clench the dough in
  your fist and twist and fold it over. Use the dough scraper to help
  gather the wet dough that sticks to the work surface into a ball
  while kneading. Repeat this action over and over again, adding only
  as much flour as it takes to keep the dough from sticking to your
  hands.  Work quickly and don't be delicate. Slap and push the dough
  around to develop its gluten and to facilitate its rolling out.
  (Kneading pizza dough is a great way to relieve pent-up aggression!)
  
  5.  When the dough no longer feels sticky, push the heel of your hand
  down into it and hold it there for 10 seconds. This will test its
  readiness;if your hand comes up clean, the dough is done. If it
  sticks, a bit more kneading will be necessary. Once the dough is no
  longer sticky, do not overwork it by adding more flour. Continue
  kneading only until the dough is smooth and elastic (it should spring
  back when pressed) and no lines of raw white flour show.  The whole
  process should take 5 to 10 minutes.
  
  6.  Lightly oil a 2 quart bowl with vegetable oil. Roll the ball of
  dough around in the bowl to coat it with a thin film of oil. Tightly
  seal the bowl with plastic wrap to trap in the moisture and heat from
  the yeast's carbon dioxide gases.  This will help the dough rise
  faster.
  
  7.  Place the bowl in a warm, draft-free place.  Let the dough rise
  for 30 to 45 minutes.
  
  8.  Once the dough has doubled in bulk, punch it down by pushing your
  fist into it.  All of the gases will quickly escape, and the dough
  will collapse. Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it again for
  about 1 minute.
  
  9.  The dough is now ready to be patted and rolled into pizza, or to
  undergo additional rising.
  
  10. To raise dough a second time, add a bit more oil to the bowl and
  repeat the procedure indicated for the first rising. Then the dough
  is ready to be shaped.

      Title: BLACK PUDDING FROM SCRATCH (ENGLISH)
 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/4 qt Fresh pig's blood
  8 7/8 oz Bread cut into cubes
  1 1/4 qt Skim milk
      1 lb Cooked barley
      1 lb Fresh beef suet
      8 oz Fine oatmeal
      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Ground black pepper
      2 ts Dried and crumbled mint
 
  Put the bread cubes to soak in the milk in a warm oven. Do not heat
  the milk beyond blood temperature! Have the blood ready in a large
  bowl, and pour the warm milk and bread into it. Stir in the cooked
  barley. Grate the beef suet into the mixture and stir it up with the
  oatmeal. Season with the salt, pepper and mint.
  
  Have ready 2 or three large roasting pans.  Divide the mixture
  between them ~- they should not be more than 3/4 full. Bake in a
  moderate oven -- 350 F ~- for about an hour or until the pudding is
  well cooked through. This makes a beautifully light pudding which
  will keep well in a cold larder.
  
  Cut into squared and fry till heated through and the outside is
  crisp, in bacon fat or butter.  Delicious for breakfast, or for
  supper with fried apples and mashed potato.

      Title: BLACK-EYE PEAS & RICE (T)
 Categories: Digest, Oct.
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      1    Onion
        x  Water/broth for saute
      1    15 oz can peeled tomatoes,
           Drained
           Or equivalent amount of
           Fresh tomatoes (~1.5 cups)
      1    15 oz can Black Eye Peas,
           Drained
      2 c  Cooked white rice
        x  Salt, pepper, garlic powder
           For seasoning
 
  Chop the onion and saute it in a good size frying pan with the broth.
  If you are using fresh tomatoes, add them and cook until they are
  soft. Stir in the remaining ingredients and heat through.
  
  Makes about 3-4 servings, as a main course casserole
  
  NOTES: Don't drain the tomatoes and black-eyes completely. You need a
  little "juice" to make it a nice mushy (comforting) casserole.
  
  I really liked it with a generous amount of pepper.
  
  This recipe was from a TV program here in Raleigh NC called "Southern
  Sportsman".  I just took out the oil and bacon. I thought it was
  pretty funny to find a healthy recipe (with modifications) off a TV
  show that talks about hunting and shooting and fishing (and
  eating..frying...the "catch"...yuk). Guess this recipe is for the
  days when the rabbits, deer, ducks, and trout are smarter!!

  is rendered.  Transfer the bacon to a large mixing bowl and add the
  crabmeat, vegetables, peas, and herbs. Mix together until thoroughly
  combined.
  
  Combine the salad with the vinaigrette.  Mound the tossed salad on a
  large serving platter, leaving at least 2 inches around the edge of

  garnish the grapefruit sections with the cilantro springs.
  
  Chef's Notes:  Chef Stephan Pyles of Star Canyon tells us that "This
  easy, do-ahead salad is a perfect entree for a summer lunch or
  picnic. Black-eyed peas, crab, and grapefruit may not exactly be an
  orthodox combination, but they are all staples of Texas cookery and
  go well together. " Entered into MasterCook by Terri Law, 8/22/96.

    Sift together flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Cut in shortening
  with a pastry blender until mixture resembles large coarse crumbs.
  Sprinkle water over flour mixture, using a fork to stir it in gently
  to make it gather into a ball (the less water the better ~ just
  enough to hold it together). Turn out onto a lightly floured board
  and shape with your hands into two balls, one slightly larger than
  the other. Chill dough for 1 hour, then roll out ball to a  8" or 9"
  circle.
    Now, mix sugar, butter and all-purpose flour in a separate bowl,
  then add a dash of salt and stir in berries.
   Mix some of the "crushed berries" into the simple syrup.
   Mound about a cup of the berry mixture onto the circle of dough,
  fold over the edges to enclose the filling.
   Repeat until all dough and berries are used.
   Preheat oven to 350f degrees.
   The enclosed bundles of berries are placed in a 9x13 baking pan.
  Over this a syrup is poured to the depth of the first knuckle of my
  grandmother's index finger (maybe about one inch). I'm guessing it
  was a simple sugar syrup, but maybe with the addition of some smashed
  blackberries. All of this was cooked in a 350 degree oven until it
  looked REALLY good--brown and bubbly--with the whole house smelling
  heavenly. Seenote; Simple Syrup
    2 1/2    cups sugar
      3/4    cups light corn syrup
    1 1/4    cups water Combine all ingredients in a large saucepan.
  Stir over low heat until sugar is completely dissolved. When clear,
  wash down sides of pan with a brush dipped in cold water. Cover
  saucepan for 5 minutes to allow steam to dissolve any remaining sugar
  crystals. Uncover and increase the heat. Boil without stirring for 5
  minutes. cool, pour into jars, and cover tightly. Store at room

  1 1/2 ts Cloves, ground
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Buttermilk
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 c  Raisins or dates, chopped
      1 c  Pecans, chopped
      1 c  Blackberry jam (seedless if

           Icing:
      3 c  Light brown sugar
      1 c  Evaporated milk
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter
 
  In a large bowl with an electric mixer, cream together the butter and
  sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the eggs and combine
  well.
  
  Into a bowl, sift together 3 cups of flour, allspice, cloves,
  cinnamon, and salt.  In another bowl, combine the buttermilk and
  baking soda. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture in batches
  alternating with the buttermilk mixture.  Beat well after each

  icing and top it with the other layer, bottom side down. Frost the
  top and sides with remaining icing.

      Title: BLACKENED CHICKEN
 Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Poultry
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
     16    3 oz skinless chicken breast

MMMMM-----------------------SEASONING MIX----------------------------
      2 tb Salt
  1 1/2 ts Garlic powder
  1 1/2 ts Ground black pepper
      1 ts White pepper
      1 ts Onion powder
      1 ts Ground cumin
    1/2 ts Gound cayenne pepper
    1/2 ts Sweet paprika

MMMMM---------------------OTHER INGREDIENTS--------------------------
    3/4 lb Melted unsalted butter
 
  NOTE: Recipe calls for 16 (3-ounce) skinless boned chicken breasts,
  about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick, or 8 (10-ounce) bone-in leg-thigh
  pieces, or a combination of these. Skin the leg-thigh pieces, then
  bone each piece along the length of the two bones, leaving meat in
  one piece. Trim off excess fat.  Pound each breast or leg-thigh
  fillet to 1/2 inch thick. Let the chicken come to room temperature
  before blackening.
   Thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl.
  Heat a large cast-iron skillet over very high heat until it is
  extremely hot and just short of the point at which you see white ash
  or a white spot forming in the skillet bottom, about 8 minutes. (the
  time will vary according to the intensity of the heat source.) Heat
  the serving plates in a 250F oven. Just before cooking each piece of
  chicken, dip it in the melted butter so that both sides are well
  coated, then sprinkle each fillet evenly with the seasoning mix,
  using about a rounded 1/2 teaspoon on each, and patting it in with
  your hands. (If you lay the fillet on a plate or other surface to
  season it, be sure the surface is warm so the butter won't congeal
  and stick to the surface instead of to the meat. Wipe the surface
  clean after seasoning each fillet.  Use any remaining seasoning mix
  in another recipe.)
     Immediately place the fillet skinned side down in the hot skillet,
  making sure all meat folds are opened up and the meat is lying flat.
  Pour about 1 teaspoon butter on the top of the fillet (be careful, as
  the butter may flame up).  If you cook more that 1 fillet at a time,
  place each fillet in the skillet before buttering and seasoning
  another one. Cook uncovered over the same high heat until the
  underside forms a crust, about 2 minutes. (The time will vary
  according to the thickness of the fillets and the heat of the skillet
  or fire; watch the meat and you'll see a white line coming up the
  side as it cooks.)  Turn the fillets over and pour about 1 teaspoon
  more melted butter on top of each. Cook just until meat is cooked
  through, about 2 minutes more.  Serve the chicken fillets crustier
  side up while piping hot.    Clean the skillet after cooking each
  batch and repeat the blackening procedure with the remaining chicken
  fillets. To serve, place 2 breast fillets or 1 leg-thigh fillet on
  each heated serving plate. If you use a large serving platter, do not
  stack the fillets. Paul Prudhomme warns, "Blackening should be done
  either outdoors or in a commercial kitchen.  The process creates an
  incredible amount of smoke that will set off your own and your
  neighbors' smoke alarms. People with really well-installed commercial
  hood vents at home have gotten away with blackening in their own
  kitchens. They are privileged! Don't push your luck." From The
  Prudhomme Family Cookbook

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     18    5 oz pork chops, 3/4" thick
    3/4 lb Melted unsalted butter (note

MMMMM-----------------------SEASONING MIX----------------------------
      1 tb Salt
      1 tb + 2 tsp white pepper
      1 tb + 3/4 tsp black pepper
  2 1/2 ts Dry mustard
  2 1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
      2 ts Garlic powder
    3/4 ts Dried thyme leaves
 
  NOTE:  The 3/4 pound (3 sticks) unsalted butter, must be kept melted
  and warm in the skillet. Let the chops come to room remperature before
  blackening.  Combine the seasoning mix ingredients thoroughly in a
  medium-size bowl.    Heat a large cast-iron skillet over very high
  heat until it is extremely hot and just short of the point at which
  you see white ash or a white spot forming in the skillet bottom,
  about 8 minutes. (The time will vary according to the intensity of
  the heat source.)
     Heat the serving plates in a 250F oven.    Just before cooking each
  chop, dip it in the melted butter so that both sides are well coated,
  then sprinkle each side generously and evenly with the seasoning mix
  (use between 1/4 and 1/2 teaspoon on each side), patting it in with
  your hands. (If you lay the chop on a plate or other surface to
  season it, be sure the surface is warm so the butter won't congeal
  and stick to the surface instead of to the chop.  Wipe the surface
  clean after seasoning each chop. Use any remnaining seasoning mix in
  another recipe.) Immediately place the chop in the hot skillet.  If
  the chop is very lean, pour about 1 teaspoon butter on top.  (Be
  careful, as the butter may flame up.) If you cook more than 1 chop at
  a time, place each chop in the skillet before buttering and seasoning
  another one.
     Cook uncovered over the same high heat until the underside forms a
  crust, about 2 minutes (the time will vary according to the thickness
  of the chops and the heat of the skillet or fire). Turn the chops
  over and pour about 1 teaspoon more butter on top of each, if needed.
  Cook just until meat is done, about 2 minutes more. Serve the chops
  crustier side up while piping hot. Clean the skillet after cooking
  each batch and repeat the blackening procedure with the remaining
  chops. To serve, place 2 or 3 chops on each heated serving plate. If
  you use a serving plater, DO NOT STACK THE CHOPS. From The Prudhome
  Family Cookbook Some personal notes: If you do not have a heavy duty
  commercial range hood, capable of disposing of an incredible amount
  of smoke, DON'T cook this inside. If you live in an apartment, like I
  do, where your smoke detector is attached to a central fire system,
  you will very quickly become well known to all your neighbors, and
  your local firefighters. In all likelyhood you will also get to meet
  your landlord. A good, 40,000 BTU to 50,000 BTU barbecue will do a
  good job of providing sufficient heat.  Be sure you have all your
  doors and windows closed, and invite your neighbors to the barbecue.
  This method generates a totally unbelievable amount of smoke.
   However, the results are worth it.  Whatever you are cooking by this
  method, it is an entirely incredible taste experience. From Prudhomme

 Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Fish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 ea 8-10oz redfish fillets
    3/4 lb Unsalted butter, melted

MMMMM-----------------------SEASONING MIX----------------------------
      1 tb Sweet paprika
  2 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Onion powder
      1 ts Garlic powder
      1 ts Ground cayenne pepper
    3/4 ts Ground white pepper
    3/4 ts Ground black pepper
    1/2 ts Dried thyme leaves
    1/2 ts Dried oregano leaves
 
  NOTE: Fish fillets (preferably redfish, pompano or tilefish) cut
  about 1/2 inch thick.  Redfish and pompano are ideal for this method
  of cooking. If tilefish is used, you may have to split the fillets in
  half horizontally to have proper thickness.  If you can't get any of
  these fish, salmon steaks or red snapper fillets can be substituted.
  In any case, the fillets or steaks must not be more than 3/4 inch
  thick. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over very high heat until it is
  beyond the smoking stage and you see white ash in the skillet bottom
  (the skillet cannot be too hot for this dish), at least 10 minutes.
  (FT - this recipe is *NOT* for the faint of heart)
     Meanwhile, pour 2 Tablespoons melted butter in each of 6 small
  ramekins; set aside and keep warm.  Reserve the remaining butter in
  its skillet. Heat the serving plates in a 250F oven.
     Thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl.
  Dip each fillet in the reserved melted butter so that both sides are
  well coated; then sprinkle seasoning mix generously and evenly on
  both sides of the fillets, patting by hand.  Place in the hot skillet
  and pour 1 teaspoon melted butter on top of each fillet (be careful,
  as the butter may flame up).  Cook, uncovered, over the same high
  heat until the underside looks charred, about 2 minutes (the time
  will vary according to the fillet's thickness and the heat of the
  skillet). Turn the fish over and again pour 1 teaspoon butter on top;
  cook until fish is done, about 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining
  fillets. Serve each fillet while piping hot.
     To serve, place one fillet and a ramekin of butter on each heated
  serving plate. I had this in K Pauls Restaurant in New Orleans. It is
  a taste experience you will never forgive yourself for missing should
  you ever be lucky enough to find yourself in N'awlins and you don't
  go to K Paul's and order this. Even people who don't like fish love
  this dish. From Chef Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen, published by

      Title: BLACKENING RUB
 Categories: Sauces, Cajun, Hot
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 tb Salt
      1 tb +2 ts White Pepper
      1 tb +3/4 ts Black Pepper
  2 1/2 ts Dry mustard
  2 1/2 ts Garlic Powder
    1/2 ts Thyme leaves (dried)
    1/4 lb Butter
  2 1/2 ts Cayenne Pepper (to taste)
 
  Use unsalted butter, melt over low heat.  Heat a cast iron pan to just
  before melting over high heat. Should take 5 to 8 minutes. If you
  think you are going to ruin the pan, the heat is just about right.
  Make sure the meat, poultry or fish is at room temp. and dry. Thin
  cuts do not work well. Dip the meat, poultry or fish into the melted
  butter and apply an even amount of rub to each side.  Put into pan
  and leave alone for a minute or so then check the underside of the
  meat for a nice dark crust. Adjust as needed.  By this time you will
  know if your smoke detectors are working and if you should of done
  this outside. Turn the meat and repeat till the desired doneness is
  achieved. The trouble is well worth it, the taste is, in a word,
  fantastic!  You can add more or less cayenne pepper to your taste,
  I've found more is usually better.

      Title: BLACKENING SPICE MIX
 Categories: Prodigy, Cajun
      Yield: 1 /4 cup
 
      1 tb Paprika
  2 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Onion powder
      1 ts Garlic powder
    3/4 ts White pepper
      1 ts Cayenne pepper
    3/4 ts Black pepper
    1/2 ts Thyme
  1 1/2 ts Oregano
 
  If you do not have the facilities to blacken the fish outdoors,
  preferably on a butane crab boiler, merely melt some butter, dredge
  your fish, chicken or meat with the above and saute in butter in your
  kitchen. You will not get your pan white hot as you must do outdoors,
  but it will be tasty. This process is called "Bronzing". When you
  blacken, you must get a heavy black iron skillet white hot so that
  when you put the butter in and the fish, it chars and takes only a
  minute or 2 on each side. This produces tons of smoke. I did it in my
  house to see what would happen and my neighbors thought my house was
  on fire. You MUST have a strong commercial exhause like restaurants
  have to do this in your kitchen.

 Categories: Rice, Vegetarian, Stews, Low-fat
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 x  -Dried black-eyed peas
    1/2    Onion
      1 x  Lipton Rice 'n' Sauce Cajun
      1 tb Pepper
      1 x  Stew Meat
      1 ts Creole or Cajun seasoning
      1 x  Bell pepper
 
       Cayenne pepper or hot sauce
  
  Look thru peas for rocks and wash through 3 waters. Soak peas in water
  overnight in fridge.  The next day, throw out water they soaked in;
  some claim this keeps beans from giving you a problem, but stay on
  this diet a couple weeks and you won't have a problem anyway. It goes
  away. Wash stew meat and put stew meat and pre-soaked peas in big pot
  on stove and bring to boil, with PLENTY of water. Add seasonings to
  taste. If you use Cajun seasoning it contains salt; so don't add
  extra salt!!!! Otherwise, add salt to taste.  When stew meat and peas
  come to a boil, reduce to Medium and keep watching to add water so
  they don't scorch. After about 40 minutes add packet of Rice and
  Sauce, preferably Cajun flavor. Start watching the water really
  carefully now, and add a pint from time to time. After about 20
  minutes of rice cooking, add bell pepper, onion, and more seasonings
  if you need.  (This dish is good hot and peppery) Everything should
  be ready at the same time. When test bite shows all is ready, eat!

  1 1/2 c  Milk
      3 oz Unsweetened chocolate;
           -  chopped
      1 ts Vanilla

MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
      4 oz Unsweetened chocolate
      4 oz Unsalted butter (1 stick)
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      3 lg Eggs
      3 c  Confectioners' sugar
 
  This is as close to the world famous Ebinger's Blackout Cake as you
  will get.  This recipe was developed by Ceri E. Hadda - a
  professional baker and food writer.
  
  Preheat oven to 350F.
  
  Make the cake.  Butter two 9-inch cake pans; dust them with flour and
  tap out the excess.  Set aside. Stir the cocoa with some of the milk
  to form a pasate. Stir in the rest of the milk, and beat with a whisk
  until the mixture is smooth. Set aside.
  
  In the bowl of an electric mixer combine the butter, shortening,
  sugar, eggs, and vanilla; beat for 1 minute, or until the mixture is
  fluffy.
  
  Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the
  mixture, alternately with the cocoa mixture, to the contents of the
  bowl, beating between additions. Begin and end with the flour
  mixture, and beat only until the dry ingredients are absorbed. Divide
  the batter between the cake pans and smooth the tops with a spatula
  to even them.

      Title: BLACKOUT CAKE - PART TWO
 Categories: Cakes, Desserts, Chocolate
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           - Continuation of Part One
 
  Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the layers shrink from the sides
  of the pans and the tops spring back when gently pressed with a
  fingertip. The cake is dense and moist, so be careful not to overbake
  it. Cool the layers on wire racks for 10 minutes, then carefully
  invert them onto the racks. Turn right side up and let cool
  completely.
  
  Make the pudding.  Combine the sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a small
  heavy saucepan.  Gradually add the milk, mixing thoroughly with a
  wire whisk. Add the chocolate. Place over moderate heat and cook,
  stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and bubbles for 3
  minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Pour into a
  small bowl and put plastic wrap or wax paper directly on the surface
  to prevent a skin from forming.
  
  Make the frosting.  Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler.
  Remove it from the heat and cool slightly. In a medium bowl, beat the
  butter, vanilla, and eggs until well mixed. The mixture will not blend
  completely - do not worry.  Gradually beat in the sugar, about 2 Tbl
  at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the melted
  chocolate. Chill the frosting while assembling the rest of the cake,
  about
       15    minutes.
  
  Cut each cake layer in half horizontally, using a serrated knife. You
  now have 4 layers, 3 for the cake assembly and 1 for the outside
  crumbs. Place one of the layers in the food processor bowl and
  pulse-chop to make crumbs; set aside.  (Or break it up with your
  hands.)
  
  Sandwich the remaining 3 layers with the chocolate pudding filling,
  assembling the cake on a cardboard circle or the bottom of a
  springform pan, if possible. Frost the side and top of the cake with
  the chocolate frosting. Working over a baking sheet lined with
  aluminum foil or wax paper, hold the cake in the palm of your hand.
  With the other hand, gently press the cake crumbs all over the top
  and sides of the cake, pressing them to adhere.  Pick up any crumbs
  that drop and press them back on.

      Title: BLACKPOOL ROCK...:)
 Categories: Ron's, British, Candies
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      2 lb Moist sugar
    1/2 pt Water
           Cream of tartar
           Colouring
           Flavoring essence
           Tartaric acid
      1 ds Golden syrup
           All British Sizes - Sorry!
 
  Blackpool Rock is exported all over the world and is famous for having
  names running right through it.  The method of adding the names is
  beyond the scope of written explanations, and would take an actual
  demonstration to learn.
                            To 'PULL' Sugar To pull sugar takes some
  learning but can be mastered:) Turn the cooked sugar on to a oiled
  slab and leave until cool enough to handle. Oil your hands, and
  working quickly, pull between the hands until it acquires a lighter
  colour and a satin finish. As it begins to set the mix is rolled into
  a long cylinders shape and cut with a sharp knife or scissors.
  
  Dissolve sugar in the water, add a good 3/4 ts cream of tartar, and
  boil to 'Large Crack' degree [312f.]. Pour onto an oiled slab and add
  coloring and flavoring. ie: Red colour for raspberry or strawberry,
  yellow with pineapple essence.  Add just a pinch of tartaric acid and
  the golden syrup. Work well following the directions for 'Pulling
  Sugar' above.
  
  If you you want  traditional looking rock: Set aside a small portion
  and colour it red.  Roll it out thin and wrap the flavoured/coloured
  mix inside it.  Lots of skill needed to get it right. Asbestos
  fingers are also helpful if you wish to avoid burns. From Ron's
  Plaice. Home of Blackpool Rock:)

  This is probably my favorite recipe eventhough this is the one which
  has evolved the most in the past 5 years. A couple of years ago my
  father mistakenly calculated the spices in tablespoons instead of
  teaspoons, and it was better then the previous batch of sausage
  written above. The next year we increased the amount of black pepper,
  and was it ever good. So if you like spices, and in sausage a little
  spice is good, then play around with the mixture a little bit. I will
  be adding a small amount of a "cajun" pepper mix to a small 20 lb.
  test batch of sausage this weekend.

 Categories: Mixes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      8    Chile pods --  whole/dried
           (seeded and deveined
      2    Garlic clove -- peeled
      1 ts Oregano
      1 ts Salt
 
  Choose the dried chiles for your dish.  They range in "heat" from
  mild to very hot, so ask your merchant to point the way. Prepare the
  chiles by slitting or cracking them open and removing the seeds and
  veins. The seeds and veins are what makes the chiles hot, so you
  should clean the peppers according to how hot you wish them to be.
  Place the chile skins in a bowl and add enough hot tap water to
  cover. Allow them to sit for 1 hour, then drain, reserving the
  liquid. Place the pepper skins in a blender and add enough of the
  reserved water to bring the total amount in your machine to 1 pint.
  Add the garlic, oregano and salt. Blend until the mixture is thick
  and smooth.    This recipe makes 1 pint. By Jeff Smith The Frugal

      Title: BLENDER PESTO
 Categories: Sauces, Pasta, Rice
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Basil leaves, fresh packed
    1/2 c  Oil, olive
      2 tb Pine nuts
      2 ea Garlic cloves; peeled
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Cheese, parmesan; grated
      2 tb Cheese, romano; grated
      3 tb Butter
 
  Put the basil, olive oil, pine nuts, garlic cloves and salt in the
  blender or food processor, (I use the food processor), and mix at
  high speed. Stop from time to time and scrape the ingredients down
  toward the bottom with a rubber spatula. When the ingredients are
  evenly blended, pour into a bowl and beat in the two grated cheeses
  by hand. (This is not much work, and it results in a more interesting
  texture and better flavor than you get when you mix in the cheese in
  the blender.) When the cheese has been evenly incorporated into the
  other ingredients, beat in the butter (softened to room temperature).
  Before spooning the pesto over pasta, add to it a tablespoon or so of
  the hot water in which the pasta has been cooked. Katie's Note: Pesto
  freezes very well, so I make as much of it as I can when basil is in
  season. (Basil is also very easy to grow, and produces a lot). Spoon
  each serving (about 3 T) into small muffin tins and freeze. When
  frozen, pop out cubes and put in plastic bags. This way, if you are
  just cooking for yourself, or for more, it's always available. I try
  to have enough on hand in the freezer in September, so I can have it,
  one way or another, once a week or so until about the next July, when
  I can begin to harvest my next crop.

 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 30 Servings
 
     30 lg Pitted dates
     30 lg Walnuts, halves
  1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
      4 tb Butter
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
    3/4 c  Light brown sugar, firmly
           -packed
      1    Egg
    1/2 c  Sour cream
           Glaze:
      4 tb Butter
      1 c  Confectioner's sugar
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
      2 tb Milk, up to 3 T
 
  Adjust a rack to the top position in the oven and preheat the oven to
  400. Cut parchement to fit cookie sheets. Slit one long side of each
  date, stuff with one walnut half or a few pieces of walnut. Close the
  date around the nut and set aside.
  
  Sift together the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda and set
  aside. Cream the butter, add the vanilla and the sugar and beat to
  mix well. Add the egg and beat thouroughly. On the lowest speed
  gradually add half the dry ingredients, then all of the sour cream,
  then the remaining dry ingredients. Scrape the bowl after each
  addition and beat only until combined. Transfer the dough to a
  shallow bowl for easier handling.
  
  Using two forks, drop each stuffed date into the the dough and roll it
  around until it is completely coated. There will be enough dough to
  cover each date, but don't overdo it or you won't have enough to go
  around. Using the forks, place the dough coated dates 2-3 inches
  apart on the prepared cookie sheets.
  
  Bake one sheet at a time for about 10 minutes until lightly browned.
  
  While baking, prepare the glaze. Melt the butter and mix it well with
  the remaining ingredients, using only enough milk to make the mixture
  the consistency of soft mayonnaise. Keep the glaze covered when you
  are not using it.
  
  Remove the cookies form the oven. With a pastry brush, immediatley
  brush the tops with a generous coating of the glaze. Transfer cookies
  to a rack to cool. Let them stand until the glaze is dry. NOTES
  : The dates I purchased from the Coop were huge. We cut the date in
  half and stuffed them with walnut pieces.  These aren't the most
  beautiful cookies but boy are they good.

      1 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Salt
      2 lg Eggs, separated
    3/4 c  Well-chilled heavy cream
 
  (Buckwheat Yeast Pancakes With Three Caviars) from 1989
  
  a 1/4-ounce package (2 1/2 teaspoons) active dry yeast about 2 cups
  sour cream as an accompaniment about 4 ounces each black caviar,
  golden caviar, and salmon roe
  
  In a large bowl proof the yeast with 1/2 tablespoon of the sugar in
  1/3 cup lukewarm water for 10 minutes, or until it is foamy. Stir in
  1 cup of the milk, heated to lukewarm, the remaining 2 tablespoons
  sugar, 2 tablespoons of the butter, and the buckwheat flour, beat the
  batter for 1 minute, and let it rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a
  warm place for 2 hours or chill it, covered tightly, overnight.
  (Chilling overnight produces a tangier flavor. Let the batter come to
  room temperature before continuing with the recipe.) Stir in the
  remaining 1 cup milk, heated to lukewarm, the all-purpose flour, the
  salt, and the yolks, beat the mixture for 1 minute, and let it rise,
  covered with the plastic wrap, in a warm place for 1 hour, or until
  it is double in bulk and bubbly. In a bowl beat the cream until it
  holds soft peaks and fold it into the batter. In a metal bowl beat
  the egg whites until they just hold stiff peaks and fold them into
  the batter gently but thoroughly.
  
  Heat a griddle or large skillet over moderate heat until it is hot,
  brush it lightly with the additional melted butter, and spoon
  tablespoons of the batter onto the griddle, spreading them to form
  3-inch rounds. Cook the blini for 1 minute on each side, or until the
  undersides are golden. Transfer the blini as they are cooked to a
  platter and keep them warm, covered with a kitchen towel. Make blini
  with the remaining batter in the same manner, brushing the griddle
  lightly with the butter as necessary. The blini may be made 2 days in
  advance and kept covered and chilled. Reheat the blini, covered with
  foil, in a 350~ F. oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they are warm,
  or microwave them on a microwave-safe platter, covered with
  microwave-safe plastic wrap, at high power (100%) for 2 minutes, or
  until they are warm.
  
  Arrange 3 or 4 blini on each of 18 small plates, top them with some
  of the sour cream, and arrange some of the caviar decoratively on the
  sour cream. Serves 18 with blini to spare.

      1 lb Cottage cheese
      1    Egg yolk
      1 tb Sugar
 
  Sift  flour  and salt.   Beat eggs well, add water. Add flour
  gradually to eggs, stirring constantly, until batter is smooth and
  thin. Heat a small frying pan, Teflon makes life easy, and smear with
  a very thin coat of butter.  When pan is hot, put in about 1/4 cup
  batter, tilt pan until it covers.  Cook until it begins to blister
  and is shiny. Turn out on table cloth. I always use one, but I Guess
  you can use paper towels. Continue until all the batter is used.
  Should make 10 or 12 circles. Mix the ingredients well. Now it's time
  to 'build your blintzas' as my daughter used to say. Put some filling
  off center on each circle. Fold the bottom up and the top down.  Tuck
  in sides, or fold in, before you put the op down. Confused? Just try
  it, it's easy. At this point you can store them in the fridge,  or
  freeze them.  They freeze well. To finish, just fry them in a small
  amount of butter, until browned Great, served with sour cream. They
  are a bit complicated, but not really difficult. Howard, I am giving
  you the recipe for 24 because it is so easy and they freeze so well.
  Use well seasoned pans, 6". This should make about 50 pancakes. I
  guess the directions don't change when you change the ammounts.

  Now, my grandmother brought me a regular loaf-shaped loaf - meatloaf
  sized. She said it made several that size. I'll have to ask her if
  she cooked it a different amount of time and if she really let it sit
  for a month before digging in. I don't think I could wait that long!

      Title: BLOODY MARIA BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Abm
      Yield: 1 Loaf
 
           -Jim Kessler RBFV65A
      3 c  Bread flour
  1 1/4 c  V-8 Vegetable juice
  1 1/2 tb Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 pk Yeast; rapid rising
      1 ts Rosemary; ground
      1 ts Basil; ground
      1 ts Garlic powder
      1 ts Onion powder; or flakes
    1/2 ts Oregano
      2 tb Virgin olive oil
           Tabasco sauce
 
  I'll have to admit that when I make this bread I usually use the V-8
  mixture that I have in the refrigerator. I add a much larger quantity
  of the herbs that are listed to a bottle of V-8 and let it set. It
  makes a nice drink with or without vodka. If you drink it with vodka,
  it's a "Bloody Mary," without vodka, it's a "Bloody Shame." The bread
  tastes better if you mix the herbs in the V-8 at least 24 hours
  before baking. Be that as it may - add all ingredients to the baking
  container of your machine and bake on basic bread cycle. It's a
  "speecy" bread and goes with well "speecy meata balls."

      Title: BLOODY MARY FROM LOREN MARTIN
 Categories: Beverages, Cyberealm, Kooknet
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     32 oz Fresh tomato juice (approx
           6 pounds tomatoes)
      4 tb Finely chopped red onion
      1 ea Red or green finely chopped
           Jalapeno pepper
      4 tb Finely chopped cucumber
           Juice of 2 limes
      2 tb Worcestershire sauce
           Salt to taste
           Fresh ground pepper to taste
      6 ea Jiggers vodka
           Tabasco sauce, to taste
      4 ea Celery stalks for garnish
      1 ea Lime cut into quarters for
           Garnish
      4 ea Cooked jumbo prawns, chilled
           For garnish
 
  To prepare the tomato juice, begin with very ripe, juicy tomatoes. The
  better the flavor of the tomatoes, the better the juice. For every
  quart of juice, you will need approximately 2 quarts of fresh
  tomatoes. Chop the tomatoes coarsely.  Place tomatoes in a stainless
  steel pot and bring to a simmer over low heat. Cook until the
  tomatoes soften completely and their juices are released.  Remove
  from heat, cool, and run the tomatoes and juice through a food mill,
  fine sieve or juicer to remove the seeds and skin. Pour the tomato
  puree into a bowl and let stand for approximately half an hour.
  Tomatoes that contain a significant amount of water may separate,
  causing the water to rise to the top. If this happens, skim off the
  water. If necessary, keep skimming as long as the juice keeps
  separating.  The more water you remove, the thicker the tomato juice.
  Taste the juice. Remember, this is not canned. It might taste
  slightly bland without the salt, sugar and citric acid used by
  commercial canners to bring out the flavors.  It should have a heavy,
  rich tomato aroma, and if the flavor doesn't quite meet your
  specifications, add salt, sugar or lemon juice to suit your palate.
  Refrigerate the juice immediately. It will keep for a few days, but
  the flavor diminishes with time.
  
  In a 2-quart pitcher, combine the tomato juice with everything except
  the celery and lime wedges.  Pour into 4 tall glasses full of ice and
  garnish with a celery stalk and lime wedge on each. If you are in a
  flamboyant mood, top each Bloody Mary with a cooked, chilled jumbo
  prawn.
  
  (In the absence of fresh tomatoes, we use either V-8 juice or canned
  tomato juice, and the results are still spectacular!)

 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea Sweet onion
      1 ea Eggs
      1 tb Milk
      2 tb Flour
      1 c  Cracker crumbs, crushed
 
  Select a well-rounded onion. Peel outer skin but leave root intact,
  cutting off any hanging roots.  With ordinary paring knife, core out
  top third of center. Angle knife for best results. Divide onion into
  four sections, by making 2 cuts crosswise, beginning at the top and
  cutting toward the root, stopping about 1/2-inch away. Cut each
  section twice again. Place onion in bowl of enough boiling water to
  cover it and leave for 5 minutes. The sections, or "petals," will
  begin to open. Remove onion from hot water and immerse in ice water,
  which will further the opening. Drain well by turning upside down on
  a paper towel. Put flour into paper bag (season with any seasonings
  you'd like--Cajun, cayenne, plain ol' s&p, etc), add onion and shake
  gently to coat with flour. Beat egg and milk; roll floured onion in
  egg.  Put cracker crumbs in paper bag, add onion, and shake gently to
  coat. Refrigerate 1 hour before deep frying to set the coating. Heat
  oil to 375-380 degrees. If oil isn't hot enough, it will be greasy
  and the batter may not stick. If oil is too hot, outside will burn
  before inside is cooked.  Place onion petal-side DOWN in HOT oil or
  use a wire basket. Cook until golden brown, 3-5 minutes. Cooked onion
  can be kept for a time in a warm oven. Serve with sauce made of
  Russian dressing and horseradish.

      1 c  Walnuts
      1 c  Crumbled blue cheese
      1    Egg beaten with 1 tb water
 
  Just chop 1 cup of walnuts (depending on the size of brie you need to
  cover) and stir into 1 cup crumbled blue cheese. Press onto the top
  of the brie and carefully wrap a sheet of thawed puff pastry dough
  (Roll out to size needed).  Use fingers wet with cold water to seal
  underside of pastry. Cut off excess to make cut-outs and adhere to
  top of brie with a little cold water.  I refrigerate my brie at this
  point until I'm ready to bake. Remove from fridge, Brush w/egg wash
  (1 egg beaten with a Tbsp. cold water) and bake on a cookie sheet
  covered with baking parchment in a 375 degree oven for about 20
  minutes until golden. (Parchment makes it simple to transfer brie to
  serving dish.) Let Baked Brie stand for 20-30 Min. before cutting to
  let it firm up a little.

      Title: BLUE CHEESE CHIPS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 130 Servings
 
    1/2 lb (8 ounces) blue cheese,
           Broken into small pieces
      8 tb (1 stick) butter or
           Margarine, softened
      2 c  All-purpose or rice flour
    1/4 c  Buckwheat groats or chopped
           Toasted nuts of your choice
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/4 c  Milk
 
  "These "blue chips" are definitely a good investment that produce
  profitable returns in the form of compliments from all who try them.
  The texture is light and lacy, and the blue cheese flavor mellows
  with baking. Try serving them with a dry white wine. 305~F. 20 to 25
  minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F. Cream the butter and cheese
  together in the food processor, or in a large bowl using a pastry
  blender or two kinves. In another bowl, stir together the flour,
  buckwheat groats or nuts (if desired) and pepper. Add the flour
  mixture to the butter-cheese mixture and blend well.
  
  Blend in the milk, little by little, to form a dough that will hold
  together in a cohesive ball. The dough should be quite stiff. Divide
  it into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry
  cloth, roll out to about 3/16 inch thick. Cut into 1-1/2-inch circles
  and place on an ungreased baking sheet, making sure the edges do not
  touch. Prick each cracker in 1 or 2 places with the tines of a fork.
  
  Bake for 15 minutes, turn, and bake for an additional 5 to 10
  minutes, or until medium brown. Yield: 130-40.

      1    Clove garlic; finely minced
    1/8    Large onion; finely minced
 
  The recipe for Blue Cheese dressing originated at the Waldorf-Astoria
  many years ago. It is very thick and chunky; use as a dip, on
  sandwiches and as a salad dressing. Crumble cheese by hand (chunky).
  Combine all ingredients. Add crumbled blue cheese. Beat mixture by
  hand until well-blended. Refrigerate 1-2 hours. This recipe makes
  about 1 quart. It will keep 10-14 days in refrigerator. I double the
  amount of blue cheese; I prefer the sharpest cheese available.

      Title: BLUE CHEESE DRESSING 3
 Categories: Salads, Sauces, Cheese
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Roquefort or Blue cheese
           (sharpest flavor)
      1 pt Hellmans or Best Foods
           Mayonnaise (regular)
    1/2 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Wine Vinegar
      2 tb Fresh Lemon Juice
           "Pinch" salt
      1 tb Sugar
    1/8 tb Worcestershire sauce
      1    Clove garlic; finely minced
    1/8    Large onion; finely minced
 
  The recipe for Blue Cheese dressing originated at the Waldorf-Astoria
  many years ago. It is very thick and chunky; use as a dip, on
  sandwiches and as a salad dressing. Crumble cheese by hand (chunky).
  Combine all ingredients. Add crumbled blue cheese. Beat mixture by
  hand until well-blended. Refrigerate 1-2 hours. This recipe makes
  about 1 quart. It will keep 10-14 days in refrigerator. I double the
  amount of blue cheese; I prefer the sharpest cheese available.
  Increase/decrease items to taste. ENJOY!

  :          Add about-----
      1/2 c  crumbled blue cheese  -- to
      3/4    and mix well
  
  Let mixture sit overnight (very important), as the blue cheese needs
  to blend with the dressing. Then, toss dressing with about 5 pounds
  of cooked, cut potatoes, more salt, and a little vinegar. I use small
  red potatoes, and then  cut them into quarters or sixths if they are
  larger. I cut them first  and then cook them, just until they are
  done, and then rinse them in cold water to stop cooking.  Then I
  usually toss them with a little vinegar and salt - remember, potatoes
  SOAK up salt.

  Original Posters Notes: From the Better Homes and Gardens "Grill It
  Right" cookbook.  Got the book at Sam's about 4 months ago. Very good
  book. I fixed this because my wife LOVES blue cheese, any form, on or
  in anything <g>.  I am so-so on it, but this is a very good recipe,
  and well worth the trouble to make the pockets and stuffing. Picky 13
  year old (It's not a big mac) even ate it <g>.

  dressed with a walnut oil vinaigrette. PREHEAT THE OVEN OR BROILER
  for the toast. Cream the cheese and butter together. Add the cognac,
  if using, season with pepper and stir in the walnuts. Toast the bread
  lightly on both sides. Spread the cheese over the toast, then return
  it to the oven or broiler just long enough for the butter and cheese
  to melt into the toast a little. It shouldn't melt completely, but
  just soften. Remove the toasts from the oven, dust them with more
  pepper and cut them into smaller pieces. Serve warm. Cool, juicy
  slices of pears would make a perfect accompaniment to the cheese and
  walnuts.

 Categories: New text im, Too hot tam
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
        3 c  Salsa de Chile Colorado
       12    blue corn tortillas
  :          Vegetable oil
        2 c  Chicken -- Cooked And Diced
        2 c  grated Monterey Jack cheese
      1/2 c  pine nuts toasted
  :          Cilantro -- finely diced
      1/2    red onion -- diced
       12    limes -- cut into wedges
  
  Make the Salsa de Chile Colorado: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In
  a mediumsize skillet, over a medium heat, fry each tortilla in a
  little of the oil until just cooked, but not crisp. Dip each
  tortilla, as you build the stacks, quickly into the Salsa de Chile
  Colorado, just to moisten. In an ovenproof baking dish large enough
  to hold 4 of the blue corn tortillas, side by side without touching,
  place the first 4 tortillas. Top each tortilla with 1/4 cup of the
  cooked chicken. Top the chicken with 1/4 cup of the grated cheese.
  Sprinkle the cheese with 1 teaspoon of the pine nuts and 1 teaspoon
  of the cilantro. Repeat layering 4 tortillas, 1/4 cup chicken, 1/4
  cup cheese, 1 teaspoon pine nuts, and 1 teaspoon cilantro and finally
  top with the last 4 tortillas. You should have 4 stacks. Pour the
  remaining Salsa de Chile Colorado over all the stacks. Bake for about
  15 to 20 minutes. Transfer each stack to a plate, garnish with the
  red onion and the lime wedges, and serve immediately. Yield: 4

      Title: BLUE CORN TORTILLAS
 Categories: Mexican
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Blue corn meal
  1 1/2 c  Boiling water
    3/4    To 1 cup all purpose flour
 
  You will need a medium-sized bowl, a griddle or heavy skillet at
  least 8 inches in diameter, and a rolling pin.
  
  Place corn meal in a bowl and pour boiling water over.  Stir to mix
  well. Let sit for fifteen minutes.  Mix in one-half cup of all
  purpose flour. Turn this mixture out onto a bread board spread with
  1/4 cup of flour. Knead for 2 to 3 minutes, incorporating the 1/4 cup
  of flour into the dough (and if necessary, use a little more). The
  dough will be soft but not at all strong.  Return the dough to the
  bowl and cover. Let rest for 30 minutes.
  
  Divide the dough into eight pieces.  Between well-floured palms, make
  flat round patties out of each of the eight and set aside. Heat your
  griddle over medium high heat, making sure that it is hot before you
  cook the first tortilla.  On a well-floured surface (as the dough is
  quite sticky), carefully roll out a tortilla until it is
  approximately 7 to 8 inches in diameter.  (We find it easiest to
  first pat out the dough with our fingers or between our palms, and
  then to roll out the tortilla at the very last just to make it
  uniform in thickness). Cook the tortilla as you would a wheat
  tortilla, approximately one minute on each side. The tortillas will
  be flecked with brown on both sides.  When cooked, remove and wrap in
  a kitchen towel.  Stack one on top of another.
  
  Blue corn is one of many different varieties of corn grown by the
  Hopi and Pueblo Indians.  It ranges in color from gray to blue to
  almost black, and is used in breads, dumplings, sauces, and in
  drinks. Blue corn tortillas are traditionally made without salt, as
  below, for salt is thought to mask the full but subtle taste of the
  blue corn.
  
  These tortillas are soft to eat, and not at all tough.  Because they
  contain a little wheat flour, they are also relatively easy to
  handle; you can pat them out by hand, then roll them to an even
  thickness if need be. They are cooked quickly in a hot ungreased
  skillet, then wrapped in a towel to stay soft and warm until ready to
  be eaten.

  stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Grind the cumin
  in a spice mill or a mortar. 2. Heat a large enameled cast-iron

  batches, add the meat to the casserole and cook over moderately high
  heat until well-browned all over, about 8 minutes. Transfer each
  batch to a large plate. 3. Add the garlic, jalapenos and onions to
  the casserole and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally,

  is very tender and the sauce is thickened, about 1 hour longer. Stir
  in the remaining cumin and simmer for 15 minutes. Garnish with the
  scallions and serve. Note:  Rathern than the commercial chili, you

      Title: BLUEBERRY & LEMON CRUMB BARS
 Categories: Blueberry, Desserts
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
           CRUST--
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour --
           Unbleached
      2 tb Sugar
      2 ts Grated lemon rind
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Cold butter -- cut in 1/4"
           Slices
      1 lg Egg yolk
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 tb Cold water -- optional
           FILLING--
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 tb All-purpose flour --
           Unbleached
    1/4 ts Freshly ground nutmeg
      2 c  Blueberries -- rinsed and
           Sorted
           TOPPING--
      5 tb Soft butter
    1/2 c  Packed light brown sugar
    3/4 c  All-purpose flour --
           Unbleached
           Confectioner's sugar
 
  Oven 400F / 200C. Butter is unsalted unless otherwise stated. Lightly
  butter a 13- x 9-inch baking pan. TO MAKE THE CRUST: Combine flour,
  sugar, lemon zest and salt in the bowl of a food processor. With the
  motor running, add pads of cold butter, a few at a time. In a small
  cup, stir together the egg yolk and vanilla. With the motor running,
  gradually add the yolk mixture; process until the mixture pulls
  together. If the mixture seems dry, add some to all of the cold
  water. Turn dough out (it will be crumbly) into the prepared pan;
  with floured fingertips, carefully press the dough into an even layer
  over the bottom of the pan. TO MAKE THE FILLING: In a large bowl,
  stir together the sugar, flour and nutmet until blended. Add the
  blueberries; stir to coat. Spread the blueberry-sugar mixture into an
  even layer over the crust. TO MAKE TOPPING: Work the butter and sugar
  together with a wooden spool until blending. Using a fork, gradually
  add the flour, stirring until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
  Sprinkle the mixture evenly over the blueberries. BAKE for 15
  minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees, and back for 25
  to 30 minutes longer, or until the edges and topping are browned and
  the blueberries are cooked. Cool on a wire rack before cutting into
  bars. Lightly sprinkle with powdered sugar before serving.

  NOTES : Marie likes to make these bars in midsummer when the
  blueberry crop is at its peak, but frozen berries may be used; the
  bars will be a little more moist. As the bars bake, the butter crust,
  sugared blueberries and brown-sugar crumb topping melt together. The
  result is a just-sweet-enough fruit bar that is perfect with a tall
  glass of lemonade or ice tea (or so says Marie, who is a Bon Appetit
  columnist and author/editor of several cookbooks.)
