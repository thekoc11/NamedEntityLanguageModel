Beanie Brownies*

brownies, deserts, vegatarian, vegetarian

1 cup brown tepary beans; cooked
1/2 cup carob powder
3/4 cup mild honey
1/4 cup margarine; melted
1/2 cup flour, all-purpose
1/2 cup walnuts, chopped
1/2 cup raisins (optional)
2 each eggs; well beaten
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla essence
1/2 teaspoon salt

Butter an 8 inch square pan. Line with waxed paper and butter the
paper. Whirl the tepary beans in a food processor until smooth. In a
large bowl, mix the processed beans with rest of the ingredients.
Spread in prepared baking dish. Bake at 325 degrees F for 30 to 35
minutes. Cool, before removing from the pan. Peel off waxed paper and
cut into squares. Makes 16 2 inch squares.

NOTE:  A rich, moist brownie, so terrific you'll probably want to
make a double batch.  No one will guess their secret goodness is
tepary beans. Carob powder is made from pods of the Carob tree,
processed to resemble cocoa powder.  However Carob contains more
nutrients and is caffeine free. It is sold in Health Food Stores.

Rosie's Award-Winning Brownies

brownies

4 ounce unsweetened chocolate
8 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperatur; e
1 1/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
2 tablespoon chopped walnuts

(From "Rosie's Bakery All Butter, Fresh Cream, Sugar-Packed,
No-Holds-Barred Baking Book" by Judy Rosenberg. Workman. $12.95)

Preheat the oven to 325'F. Lightly grease an 8" square pan with
butter or vegetable oil.

Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler placed
over simmering water. Cool the mixture for 5 minutes. Place the sugar
in a medium-size mixing bowl and pour in the chocolate mixture. Using
an electric mixer on medium speed, mix until blended, about 25
seconds. Scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula.

Add the vanilla. With the mixer on medium-low speed, add the eggs one
at a time, blending after each addition until the yolk is broken and
dispersed, about 10 seconds. Scrape the bowl after the last egg and
blend until velvety, about 15 more seconds.

Add the flour on low speed and mix for 20 seconds. Finish the mixing
by hand, being certain to mix in any flour at the bottom of the bowl.
Stir in 1/2 cup of the nuts.

Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan and sprinkle the
remaining 2 tablespoons of nuts over the top.

Bake the brownies on the center oven rack until a thin crust forms on
top and a tester inserted in the center comes out with a moist crumb,
about 35 minutes. The center of the brownies should never quite rise
to the height of the edges.

Remove the pan from the oven and place it on a rack to cool for 1 hour
before cutting the brownies. Serve the next day - it takes a day for
the flavor to set.

Makes 9-12 brownies.

Yield: 12 servings

Sharon's Famous Passover Brownies & Brownie I

brownies, bars, frostings, jewish, passover

2  slightly beaten eggs
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup cooking oil
1/2 cup matzo cake meal
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate pieces
1/2 cup coarsely chopped nuts (opt) dark ch; ocolate glaze (opt)

In mixing bowl, beat eggs, sugar, cocoa powder and salt.

Add oil to mixing bowl and blend well. Stir in the matzo cake meal and
chocolate pieces. Stir in nuts, if desired.

Line an 8x8x2" baking pan with foil. Grease lightly. Turn batter into
prepared pan and spread evenly.

Bake at 325-F for 25 to 30 minutes or till done (top will be shiny and
edges dry). Let cool in pan on wire rack.

Meanwhile, prepare glaze if desired. Spread over cooled brownies.

Dark Chocolate Glaze: In a small heavy saucepan or skillet, melt 1 cup
semisweet chocolate pieces over low heat. Remove from heat and stir
in 1 teaspoon butter or margarine. In a small bowl, dissolve 1/2 teaspoon
instant coffee crystals in 1 Tbsp hot water. Stir in 3 Tbsp dairy
sour cream and 1/4 teaspoon maple flavoring. Add sour cream mixture to
chocolate, stirring till smooth and shiny. Makes about 3/4 cup.

Note: For a regular brownie, you can substitute 3/4 cup all purpose
flour for the matzo cake meal and add 1 teaspoon vanilla. Also, you can
double the recipe. Use a 13x9x2" baking pan and bake batter for about
30 minutes.

Brownie Ice Cream Pie: Prepare brownie batter as directed. Line a 9"
pie plate with foil and grease lightly. Turn batter into pie plate.
Bake at 325-F for 30 minutes. Remove from oven. Using the back of a
wooden spoon dipped in cocoa powder, press hot brownies down, then
gradually outward and evenly up the sides of pie plate. Cool, then
freeze till firm.

Make Dark Chocolate Glaze while crust is freezing; cool glaze to room
temperature. Lift shell from plate; remove foil. Fill with 1/2 gal of
slightly softened ice cream or frozen yogurt, adding a middle layer
of the glaze and more chopped nuts. (If you'd like a smaller pie, use
1 qt of ice cream in the crust, then top with glaze and chopped
nuts.) Sharon Winstein and her friend Louise Levitt created these
flour-free brownies for their first temple cooking class. For a
twist, make the Brownie Ice Cream Pie.

Crockpot Brownie Cakes In A Jar

cakes, brownies, crockpot

2  canning jars, wide mouth (see note)
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
1/3 cup butter or margarine
1/4 cup water
3 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4 cup buttermilk
1  egg, beaten
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup walnuts, finely chopped

Well grease two 1-pint straight-sided wide-mouth canning jars; line
the bottom of each jar with waxed paper. Set aside.

In a small bowl stir together flour, sugar, baking soda and
cinnamon, if desired. Set aside.

In a medium saucepan combine butter or margarine, water, and cocoa
powder; heat and stir till margarine is melted and mixture is well
blended. Remove from heat; stir in flour mixture. Add buttermilk, egg
and vanilla; beat by hand until smooth. Stir in nuts.

Pour mixture into the prepared canning jars. Cover the jars tightly
with greased foil. (Place greased-side down on each jar).

Place jars in a 3 1/2, 4, 5, or 6-quart crockery cooker with liner in
place.  Cover; cook on high heat setting for 2-3/4 to 3 hours or until
cakes spring back when touched and a long wooden toothpick inserted
near the centers comes out clean. Remove jars from cooker; cool 10
minutes. Unmold cakes; remove waxed paper. Serve warm or cool with
ice cream. Makes 8 servings.

WARNING: Use only CANNING JARS for this recipe. Others may not be
tempered to withstand the heat. Do NOT use coffee or vegetable cans
as most contain lead and are painted or sealed with materials that
may give off toxic gases when heated.

aken from "Better Homes and Gardens New Crockery Cooker"

This recipe doesn't say you can seal them up and store them in your
pantry but my Kerr Canning book recipe says you can; here's how:

Remove jars from the oven one at a time, wipe rim of jar clean; put
on lid and ring and screw on tightly.
Jars will seal as the cake cools. Store like canned goods.

If you'll be giving these as gifts, take a piece of decorative cloth
(about 1-inch larger in circumference than the lid) and put it on top
of the lid, then screw on the ring. Make sure you screw the lid on
very tightly. I like to use pinking shears to cut the cloth out with.
I've posted a recipe for baking the jars in the oven, it's posted on
the Sweet Bread topic.
