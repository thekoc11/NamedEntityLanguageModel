For Pita Crisps: Cut 4 pita breads into 8 triangles each. Split each triangle in half at the fold and arrange, rough-side up, on a baking sheet. Toast in a 425°F oven for 8 to 12 minutes, or until light and golden. Serve the same day. Makes 64 crisps, 10 calories, 0 g fat each.

For Poppy-Seed Breadsticks: On a lightly floured surface, roll 1/2 pound pizza dough into a rectangle roughly 18 by 6 inches. Cur crosswise into 1-inch strips. Twist each strip gently and arrange on a lightly oiled baking sheet. With a fork, blend 1 egg white with 1 tablespoon water; brush lightly over breadsticks. Sprinkle with 1 1/2 tablespoons poppy seeds. Bake in a 450°F oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until browned. Serve the same day. Makes about 18 breadsticks. 50 calories, 1 gram fat each.

For Sesame Crackers: On 2 lightly oiled baking sheets, arrange 4 flour tortillas in a single layer. With a fork, blend 1 egg white with 1 tablespoon water; brush lightly over the tortillas. Sprinkle the tortillas evenly with 1 tablespoon sesame seeds; season with salt. Bake in a 400°F oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until light golden. Break into larger irregular pieces. (The crackers will keep in an airtight container for up to 1 week.) Makes about 16 crackers, 30 calories, 1 gram fat each.

For Classic Crostini: Cut a 16 to 20 inch long baguette into 1/2 inch thick slices. Arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet. Toast in a 400°F oven, turning slices over once, for 8 to 12 minutes, or until they start to brown. Serve shortly after baking. Makes about 30 crostini. 40 calories, 1 gram fat each.

For Polenta Crostini: Cut a 16-ounce package of prepared polenta into 1/4 inch thick slices; pat dry.

     1/2  pound         skinless dried fava beans
                        --2 cups
   2      tablespoons   olive oil

   2                    vine-ripened tomatoes -- chopped
     1/2  cup           thinly sliced radishes

1. Put fava beans in a large bowl of cold water. Let stand in a cool place for at least 4 hours or overnight. If the weather is warm, place the bowl in the refrigerator.

2. Drain and rinse the beans. Place them in a large pot and add fresh water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a slow simmer and cook, uncovered, over low heat until the beans are very soft and all of the liquid has been absorbed, about 1 hour. Stir often toward the end of the cooking time, and add a little more water if the beans become too dry. Mash the beans with a potato masher until smooth. Stir in oil and season with salt.

3. In a large pot, combine spinach, dandelion greens or broccoli rabe and 2 tablespoons of water. Cover and cook over medium-high heat until wilted and tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a colander and press out any excess cooking liquid.

4. Spoon the warm fava bean puree into the center of a warmed platter. Place cooked greens, olives, onions, arugula or watercress, pepperoncini, tomatoes and radishes in 7 separate piles around the puree and serve.

Makes 4 servings.

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***FILLING***
     1/4  cup           bulgur
   1      cup           hot water
     1/2  pound         lean ground lamb

   2      tablespoons   chopped fresh mint
   1      tablespoon    fresh lemon juice

     1/4  teaspoon      freshly ground black pepper
                        --plus more to taste
     1/4  teaspoon      freshly grated nutmeg
     1/4  teaspoon      ground cinnamon
                        ***PASTRY***
   3      tablespoons   olive oil
  12      sheets        phyllo dough -- thawed
   1 1/2  teaspoons     sesame seeds

TO MAKE FILLING: 1. In a bowl, combine bulgur and water. Set aside to soften, about 30 minutes. Drain and set aside. 2. In a large nonstick skillet, cook lamb over medium-high heat, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until well browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer lamb to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. Wipe out skillet. 3. Heat oil in the skillet over low heat. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring, until onion is softened and golden, 5 to 7 minutes. (Add 1 tablespoon water if onion gets too dry.) Add lamb, reserved bulgur, chicken broth, raisins, mint, lemon juice, tomato paste, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, nutmeg and cinnamon. Return to a simmer. Cook, stirring often, until liquid has been absorbed, 5 to 10 minutes. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Let cool.

TO PREPARE PASTRY & FORM TRIANGLES: 1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat it with nonstick spray. 2. Put oil in a small bowl. Dampen a pastry brush with water, shaking off excess. 3. Lay 1 sheet of phyllo on a work surface with a short side closest to you. Brush lightly with oil and place another sheet of phyllo on top. Lightly brush with more oil. Cut phyllo lengthwise into 4 strips. Place 1 tablespoon lamb mixture at the bottom of each strip and fold one comer of the strip diagonally over the filling to the opposite edge, forming a triangle. Continue folding the filling up in the pastry, as you would a flag. Place on prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining phyllo and filling to form 24 triangles in all. 4. Brush tops of triangles lightly with remaining oil and sprinkle with sesame seeds. (The triangles can be formed, frozen on a baking sheet, then transferred to plastic storage bags. They will keep, frozen, for up to 1 month. Do not thaw before baking.) 5. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until triangles are golden brown and crisp. Let cool slightly before serving.

MAKES 2 DOZEN TRIANGLES.
