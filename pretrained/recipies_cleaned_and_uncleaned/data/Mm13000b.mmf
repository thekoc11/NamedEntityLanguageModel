     leaf and whole peppercorns.
  Heat oil in heavy pot, add carrots, onions and mushrooms and cook over
  medium heat for 2 minutes.
  Add fish scraps, lobster head, bouquet garni, seaweed and water and simmer
  very slowly for 2 hours skimming off any scum that forms on the surface.
  Strain fish stock through a fine sieve or a strainer lined with a tea
  towel. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
  If desired, blend cornstarch and milk together and stir into stock. Cook
  gently until the sauce is thickened. Blend smooth in blender or food
  processor.

  from heat. Oil grill and broil fish for about 4 minutes, then turn and
  continue broiling for 8 - 10 minutes or until fish flakes with a fork.
  Season with salt and pepper, serve with hot sauce.

  arrange fish on top, pour 1 cup of sauce over seaweed, cover and bake at
  450 degrees for 8 - 10 minutes. Or, you can steam the fish. Arrange as in
  baking, steam for about 8 minutes.
  Christian Leveque, chef-proprietor of Restaurant Champs Elysees made this
  low-fat sauce for grilled red snapper with a fish stock he seasoned with
  seaweed.

      Title: Sur Le Gril Chopped Liver
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Fresh Calves' Liver                 1 ea Egg, hard-cooked, mashed
      2 tb Salad Oil                           1 x  Salt
      3 tb Butter                              1 x  Freshly Ground Pepper
      1 ea Large Spanish Onion, chopped   
 
  With a sharp knife, remove the tough outer membranes from liver.
  In a heavy skillet, heat oil and add chopped onions. Cook over medium high
  heat until translucent and golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and
  set aside.
  Add butter to skillet. Heat until melted. Add liver pieces. Over medium
  heat, fry liver until just done - 3 minutes on each side. Alternatively,
  liver can be brushed with butter and broiled. To test for doneness, cut a
  piece from liver slice. If still pink, continue cooking for 30 - 60
  seconds. Overcooking causes the liver to be dry and tough.
  For finely mashed egg that disappears in the liver mixture, force egg
  through a wire strainer. For best results, separate the hard cooked whites
  from yolks and sieve them separately. Set aside.
  Fit meat grinder with a medium blade and place cooked liver and cooked
  onions in the grinder. Grind, then regrind the ground mixture.
  In a medium mixing bowl, combine the twice ground meat and onions mixture
  with the sieved eggs. Add salt and pepper. Taste and adjust seasoning. If
  desired, add a few drops of commercial gravy browning liquid to heighten
  color.
  Refrigerate for 24 hours before serving. Serve with slices of tomato,
  cucumber and dark rye bread.
  Serves 4.

    1/2 c  Orange Juice                      1/2 c  Seasoned flour

  Pound the chicken breasts to 1/4 inch thickness.
  Reserve 8 perfect mango slices for garnish.
  In a blender or food processor, whirl mangoes (including syrup) with
  orange juice, garlic and salt. Set aside.
  Heat oil in saute pan. When hot, dip chicken breasts in seasoned flour --
  be careful to shake off excess flour -- and place them in the hot pan.
  Saute chicken, for approximately 2 minutes per side.
  Add butter and mango puree to the pan. Cook until the sauce is reduced and
  fairly thick -- about 2 minutes.
  With a spatula, remove the mango-covered chicken breasts from the pan and
  place them on a hot platter. Spoon remaining mango puree over the chicken.
  Sprinkle with toasted almonds. Garnish each breast with 2 mango slices.
  For a more pronounced mango flavour, use fresh mangoes. Use 2 fresh
  mangoes and 1/2 cup of orange juice. Boil for 1 minute.
  From owner-chef Barry Pall of Pappacito's, a fast-food restaurant in the
  Bell Canada Tower ind downtown Montreal. He refused to identify the spices
  in the seasoned flour but will admit that there are 2 teaspoons of
  powdered chicken soup per cup of flour.

    1/2 c  Bitter Cocoa Powder                 1 lb Plus 1 Cup Powdered Sugar
 
  Blend all COOKIE DOUGH ingredients together until you can shape the dough
  into a smooth ball.  Let it stand 20 minutes, loosely covered.  Form dough
  into marble-sized balls.  Place 2 inches apart on greased cookie sheet.
  Flatten each with smooth bottom of a drinking glass greased once and
  dipped into Nestles' Quick Powder. (Or use sweetened chocolate drink
  powder).  Bake at 400 degrees for 8 minutes.  Remove cookies at once from
  baking sheet, to paper toweling and at once, flatten each cookie with back
  of pancake turner.  Let cool 20 minutes.  Fill with COOKIE FILLING
  mixture.
  (Cookie Filling)
  Soften gelatin in cold water.  Place in heatproof cup in pan of hot water
  till gelatin is transparent.  Meanwhile beat Crisco till fluffy, adding
  vanilla and sugar a little at a time.  Beat in Gelatin mixture when it is
  completely cooled, but not yet "set" or firm.  This is used to give the
  filling stability - as well as protein!  When cooled, shape filling into 1
  inch balls.  Place between the two bottom sides of the cooled cookies,
  pressing gently till filling has spread to edge of cookies and rounded-out
  like the originals.
  This is suppose to be a great imitation version of the original Nabisco
  Oreos.

  whipped cream. Chill in the refrigerator until the mixture mounds well
  when spooned.  Turn into the chocolate pie shell.  Chill in the

      3 tb Oil                               1/4 c  Packed brown sugar
 
  MARINATING:  Break tamarind apart, place in a small saucepan with water.
  Simmer, covered, for about 10 minutes or until pasty coating separates from
  seeds.  Press through a sieve or food mill to extract all pulp and soupy
  liquid.  Discard seeds.  Rinse shrimps thoroughly, pat dry and marinate fro
  1 hour with 1 tablespoon of this tamarind liquid, the oyster sauce and hot
  chili sauce. COOKING:  Meanwhile, cut young ginger into toothpick-sized
  slivers.  If using mature ginger, peel and sliver. Peel and sliver garlic.
  Place blachan in a non-stick pan and heat gently fro 3 to 4 minutes to
  develop the flavors. Pell and cut red onions into wedges. Combine oyster,
  soy and chili sauces with blachan; stir into remaining tamarind liquid.
  Heat a large wok over high heat.  When a drop of water sizzles immediately
  into steam pour in 2 tablespoons of the oil.  Swirl up sides of wok, and
  when just at smoking point, dump in ginger and garlic. Stir fry until
  golden, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Adding more oil as needed, stir frey shrimp
  in batches until orange red, about 3 minutes. Pour sauces over all the
  shrimp in the wok and cook at a brisk bubble over high heat until shrimps
  are aromatic and sauces have reduced and thickened to enrobe the shells,
  about 8 minutes.  Mix in sugar and onion wedges, taste to adjust seasoning,
  sweetening and spiciness. Makes plenty for 6 as a principal dish with rice,
  enough for 8 with other dishes.

  onto the baking sheet as thinly as possible so that the baked product will
  crumble easily. Bake crust at 375 degrees for 5 to 7 minutes. Let crust
  harden, then slide the cookie from the sheet and cool completely. Roll over
  the cookie with a rolling pin until it is crushed to a fine crumb. (There
  should be about 2 1/4 cups of crumbs.) Melt 1 stick plus 1 tablespoon of
  unsalted butter. Mix it into the crumbs and pack the mixture over the
  bottom and up the sides of a 10-inch springform pan. Freeze for 30 minutes
  before filling in order to set the crust. Note: When I made this, I made
  individual cookie crumb crusts for the "Kit's Chocolate Mousse" recipe by
  using a large muffin pan. Line each cup with waxed paper for easy removal.

      Title: Champagne Chicken
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 ea Chicken breast/boned/skinned        2 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Butter                            1/4 c  Champagne; dry
    1/2 c  Heavy cream                         3 tb Tarragon; fresh (1 t dry)
      1 x  Salt & freshly ground pepper        1 x  ----optional ingredients----
      6 ea Prosciutto slices/paper thin        3 ea Shallots; finely chopped
      1 tb Butter or margarine            
 
  *** See instructions at end if using the optional ingredients. Cut chicken
  into 1/4" wide slices. Melt the butter and olive oil in a large heavy
  skillet. Saute the chicken for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the chicken and keep
  warm. Deglaze the pan with the champagne. Add the cream to the pan. Add the
  tarragon and reduce the sauce for two minutes. Put the chicken back into
  the pan and bring just to a simmer. Remove to serving platter. Serve hot
  with fresh vegetables or over rice or pasta. (I serve this over fettucini,
  or with a side dish of Fettucini Alfredo). *** Cut chicken breasts in half
  only. Place each half between sheets of waxed paper and pound with a meat
  tenderizer until about 1/8" thick. Saute shallots in butter until tender.
  Divide shallots equally between the breast halves, spreading evenly over
  each. Place one slice of prosciutto on each breast half, fold in half, and
  secure with toothpicks. Saute about 4 to 5 minutes on each side in the
  butter and olive oil listed in the original ingredients. Chicken is done
  when it springs back when lightly pressed with finger. Follow the balance
  of the instructions listed above for the sauce. Source: The original recipe
  came from "The Martha Culbertson Cook Booklet" published by Culbertson
  Winery. The "additional ingredients" modification is my own.

      4 ea Chicken breast halves; skin       3/4 c  Parmesan; freshly grated
      2 tb Parmesan; freshly grated          3/4 c  Breadcrumbs; fresh white
      1 tb Parsley; minced fresh             1/8 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Pepper; freshly ground              1 ea Egg
    1/2 c  Milk                                2 c  Olive oil
      2 tb Butter; unsalted                    2 tb Lemon juice; fresh
      1 ea Lemon; quartered                    1 x  Parsley springs; fresh
 
  Flatten chicken breasts between sheets of waxed paper to thickness of 3/8
  inch, using meat mallet or rolling pin.  Mix cheese, breadcrumbs, minced
  parsley, salt and pepper in large bowl.  Whisk egg with milk in medium bowl
  to blend.  Dip chicken into egg, then into breadcrumb mixture, coating
  completely and pressing to adhere.  Shake off excess breadcrumbs. Heat oil
  in heavy large deep skillet to 375 degrees. Add chicken and cook until
  golden brown and cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Using tongs,
  transfer to paper towels and drain. Transfer chicken to platter. Melt
  butter in small saucepan. Mix in lemon juice and pour over chicken. Garnish
  with lemon wedges and parsley sprigs. *** My notes: I found that 3/4 cup
  each parmesan and breadcrumbs makes too much coating for 4 chicken breasts,
  so I reduced the amounts to 1/2 cup each- which is still about enough for 6
  breasts. I use Bertolli Extra Light olive oil for frying, and just enough
  to cover the bottom of the skillet.

  Poach chicken by placing in a large pot with enough cold water to barely
  cover.  Add peppercorns, bay leaf, parsley, thyme and one each: onion,
  carrot and celery cut into quarters.  Bring to a bare boil with lid on;
  reduce heat to low and simmer for 50 minutes.  Cool in poaching liquid,
  then drain, skin and shred. To make curry flavouring, soften diced onion in
  hot oil, then add curry powder and cook over medium-high heat for a further
  3 minutes.  Add wine and water.  Boil rapidly until reduced to about 3
  tablespoons.  Strain and let cool. Prepare curry mayonnaise by combining
  all ingredients until smooth. Place peppers in a large bowl (reserving a
  little for garnish), with chicken, pasta, salt, pepper and curry
  mayonnaise.  Mix gently until well- coated. If mayonnaise mixture is too
  thick, add warm water gradually until a smooth consistency is attained.
  Place a portion of salad on bed of spinach and sprinkle reserved peppers on
  top. Assemble just before serving, as the mayonnaise quickly loses its
  fresh look.

  high speed until soft peaks form and mixture is thick enough to spread. DO
  NOT overbeat or you will have butter instead of whipped cream. NOTE: The
  original recipe came from a GI who found it in Egypt when he was stationed
  there.  Hence the name.  The whipped cream frosting was added later but
  really adds to the recipe.

  and simmer until beginning to thicken, about 1 minute.  Mix in 1/2 cup

  pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite,
  stirring occasionally. Drain well.  Return to hot pot. Add sauce and stir

  cheese separately. *** My notes:  When I made this, I used 1 cup whipping
  cream, 1/2 cup each Parmesan and Romano, 1 tbsp dried basil, and
  substituted 4 or 5 thin slices of Prosciutto for the bacon- frying slightly
  in butter. I used about 6 ounces of "Pesto Linguini", which is a thinner

  2 T rum.  Sift baking powder and flour together. Gently mix into the butter
  mixture.  Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry. Gently fold the egg
  whites into the batter.  Pour into a well-greased 10-inch tube pan. Bake in
  a preheated 325 degree F. oven for about 60 minutes or until the cake tests
  done.  Cool cake in pan for 10 minutes adn then turn out on wire rack to
  cool completely. Slice cake crosswise into 3 layers. Pour about 2 T of rum
  over each layer. Butter-Cream Filling: For butter-cream filling, boil sugar
  and water to 238 degrees F. (soft ball stage). Beat egg yolks until very
  light and fluffy, 5 to 10 minutes. While still beating the egg yolks, add
  the sugar syrup in a thin stream. Beat 5 minutes more, until very thick and
  doupled in bulk.  Slowly beat in the rum.  Beat the butter in a small bowl
  until soft and light.  Beat butter into the egg mixture a little at a time.
  Continue beating until thick.  Chill until mixture can be spread. If
  mixture is too soft, beat in additional butter. PRALINE TOPPING: While
  butter-cream is cooking, spread 2 T butter thickly in a 9 X 13-inch baking
  pan for praline topping. Then in a 1-quart saucepan, boil sugar an water to
  238 degrees F. (soft ball stage). Stir in almonds; cook until mixture
  reaches 310 degrees F. or until syrup carmelizes.  Pour syrup into prepared
  baking pan.  When cool, break up praline and grind it in a blender for a
  few seconds. APRICOT GLAZE: Finally heat jam and press through a strainer
  or sieve to make apricot glaze. CAKE ASSEMBLY: To assemble cake, place
  bottom layer of cake on cake plate and spread with half of the butter
  cream.  Repeat with second layer.  Place third layer on top. Spread top and
  sides of cake with apricot glaze.  Press praline powder onto glaze. Any

  In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks.  Slowly add the oil while whisking to
  make a basic mayonnaise.  It will work only if you add the oil very, very
  slowly at first.  You can also use a food processor to make this dressing,
  but again, you must add the oil ever so slowly to get the desired
  consistency. Once the mayonnaise is made, add all the ingredients except
  the vinegars. Make sure the the dressing is well mixed and ingredients are
  evenly distributed throughout. Slowly stir in the tarragon vinegar and then
  the red wine vinegar, making sure that they are evenly blended. This
  dressing must be stored in the fridge or it will spoil. Yield 5 cups

      Yield: 12 servings
 
     18 oz Semisweet chocolate                 2 c  Heavy cream; well chilled
      6 ea Egg                                 2 tb Confectioner's sugar
      2 tb Creme de cacao                      1 tb Vanilla extract
 
  1.  Melt the chocolate over hot water. Let it cool until only warm. 2.
   While the chocolate cools, whip the cream until it forms medium-stiff
  peaks. Do not overbeat or the mousse will lose some of its smooth, light
  texture. 3.  Separate 4 of the eggs and set the whites aside. Combine yolks
  with the 2 remaining whole eggs in the bowl of an electric mixer. Beat
  until eggs are thick and lemon colored, around 5 minutes. While the yolks
  are beating, place the 4 egg whites in a clean copper or stainless steel
  bowl and whisk, preferably by hand, until the whites start to stiffen.
  Sprinkle on the confectioners' sugar and beat until you have firm peaks. 4.
  Working quickly, add the cooled melted chocolate and a scoop of the whipped
  cream to the egg yolks. Stir until smooth, then add the remaining cream.
  When it is fully incorporated, add the liqueur and vanilla, then fold in
  the whites until just blended. 5. This mousse can be poured into small
  individual serving dishes or into 1 larger dessert dish. Chill at least 4
  hours before serving. (Chilling it overnight intensifies the flavor.) The
  mousse may be frozen for up to 2 weeks. Remove from the freezer and let it
  sit in the refrigerator overnight before serving. VARIATION: Make a Brownie
  Cookie Crust from the Brownie Cookies recipe, then fill it with the mousse.
  Chill for 4 hours, then pipe whipped cream on top.

  walnut oil; add good-quality wine or vinegar and a combination of fresh and
  dried herbs, seasonings, garlic and soy sauce to make a flavorful marinade.
  1.  Place all ingredients in glass screw-top jar; shake vigorously. Arrange
  meat in shallow glass dish; pierce with a fork. Pour marinade over meat;
  turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate several hours or overnight, turning
  meat occasionally. 2.  Remove meat from marinade; pat dry. Remove any
  pieces of spices or herbs that may stick to meat. This recipe is a steak

      2 lb Potatoes; new (approximatel         1 ea Dill cream dressing recipe
      5 ea Green onions; finely choppe         1 x  Salt & pepper to taste
 
  A local restaurant serves a simple, but elegant, potato salad as part of
  their Sunday Brunch menu.  This is my own attempt at duplicating it. Stir
  the chopped green onions into the Dill Cream Dressing.  Add salt and pepper
  to taste.  You may also want to add more lemon juice or Dijon mustard at
  this point, as this produces a fairly bland dressing. Slice potatoes (leave
  skins on) about 1/4 inch thick. Place in a large bowl and fold in the
  dressing.  Serve chilled.  Best made the day before so the flavors have a
  chance to mingle. Source:  Sallie Austin

 Categories: Salads, Dressings
      Yield: 8 servings
 
    2/3 c  Safflower or corn oil             1/4 c  Lime juice
      2 tb Orange juice                        2 tb Orange rind; grated
      2 tb Honey                               2 tb Onion; minced
      1 tb Poppy seeds                         1 x  Salt & pepper to taste
 
  ** I used peanut oil and minced green onions when I made this.  I served it
  on a salad of Boston lettuce with melon and chopped prosciutto. Slightly
  toast the poppy seeds (method below).  Place all ingredients in a screw-top
  jar. Shake vigorously.  Chill until serving. This dressing complements any
  green salad, but the addition of some small chunks of cantelope, honeydew,
  or star fruit to your greens will enhance the orange-honey flavor of the
  dressing.  Or try it over slices of cold roast pork with nectarine wedges
  on watercress. Poppy Seeds: Did you know that it takes almost a million
  seeds to make a pound? These tiny bluish-black gems come from the opium
  poppy plant. But even if you eat a million, you won't experience any
  narcotic effect. Connoisseurs say those imported from Holland taste best.
  For even better flavor, seeds should be slightly toasted in a 350 degree
  oven for about 5 minutes.

      4 oz Baking chocolate                    1 x  ----------frosting----------
    1/3 c  Butter or regular margarine         3 c  Confectioners' sugar
    1/2 c  Sour cream                          3 oz Baking chocolate
 
  Sift togetehr the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a
  large mixing bowl.  Add shortening, sour cream, vanilla, eggs, water and
  chocolate (melted then cooled).  Beat with an electric mixer at low speed,
  scraping bowl constantly, for 1/2 minute.  Increase speed to high and beat
  an additional 3 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Pour batter into 2
  greased and waxed-paper lined 9-inch round cake pans. Bake in a preheated
  350 degree F. Oven for 35 minutes or until cake tests done. Cool in pans on
  racks for 10 minutes. Remove from pans and cool completely on the racks.
  Place one cake layer on serving plate. Spread with Sour Cream / Chocolate
  Frosting.  Top with second cake layer.  Frost sides and top of the cake
  with the remaining Sour Cream/Chocolate Frosting. SOUR CREAM/CHOCOLATE
  FROSTING: Combine the softened butter or margarine, confectioners' sugar,
  and sour cream in a mixing bowl; blend well. Add chocolate which has been
  melted and cooled and vanilla.  Beat until smooth. NOTE: I have seen
  reference to people having trouble with their layer cakes and how they
  rise.  Try this little trick when making this cake. Take the layer that has
  the least amount of rise on the top and trim it to be flat with a sharp
  knife.  Place the trimmed side down (layer should be upside down). Then
  frost between layers and place the other layer on right side up and
  finished frosting.  It will give the illusion of having a cake with only
  one domed layer and will sit better on your cake plate. Also the trimmings
  are great eating just plain for the cook or for the kids.

  1 1/2 c  Graham Cracker Crumbs               6 tb Butter; Melted, *
    1/4 c  Sugar; Granulated             

---------------------------------CHEESECAKE---------------------------------
      1 lb Cream Cheese                      1/2 c  Sugar; Granulated
      3 ea Eggs; Large, Separated            1/4 c  Unbleached Flour
      1 ts Lemon Rind, Grated                  2 ts Lemon Juice
      1 ts Vanilla Extract                   1/2 c  Heavy Cream

  *      Use sweet cream butter and DO NOT substitute margarine. ** Make the
  passion fruit pulp from fresh passion fruits or substitute
  ~-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE:  Prebaked crusts are much crisper than the chilled ones and this can
  be important if you want a crisp crust. CRUST: If you are prebaking the
  shell, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Place the crumbs in a mixing
  bowl and add the butter and sugar blending well. Press the crumb mixture
  into the bottom and up the sides of an 8-inch springform pan. Smooth the
  mixture to form an even layer on the bottom and sides. Bake the crust in
  the oven for 10 minutes and let cool to room temperature before filling.
  NOTE:  This crust can be chilled for 5 to 10 minutes in the freezer until
  it is set but is not recommended in this recipe. CHEESECAKE: Preheat the
  oven to 300 degrees F.  In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and
  sugar until light and fluffy.  Add the egg yolks, one at a time, beating
  well after each.  Beat in the flour, lemon rind, lemon juice, and vanilla
  until just mixed.  Whip the cream until stiff in a medium mixing bowl. Set
  aside.  In another mixing bowl, beat the egg whites until they form stiff
  peaks, then fold them into the cheese mixture. Fold in the reserved whipped
  cream.  Stir in the passion fruit pulp then pour the mixture into the
  prepared crust and bake fro 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool, in the oven, to
  room temperature, then chill.

      3 tb Shortening; Chilled                 5 tb Water; Cold

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
    1/2 c  Cottage Cheese                      1 c  Heavy Cream
    1/4 c  Cream Sherry                        3 ea Eggs; Large
      2 ea Egg Yolks, Large                  1/3 c  Sugar; Granulated

    1/4 ts Cinnamon; Ground                  1/4 c  Currants; Dried
 
  *     DO NOT use margarine in this recipe.
  ~-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  CRUST: Sift together the flour, salt and sugar into a medium-sized mixing
  bowl. Add the butter to the flour all at once. Mix together until well
  blended.
   Then add the shortening and continue to blend by cutting it into the flour
  mixture.  The mixture will begin to look like crumbs or small pebbles. It
  will have the texture of oatmeal.  Sprinkle the water over the dough,
  distributing it evenly throughout.  The dough will be come sticky and cling
  together.  Gather it into a ball and wrap it in plastic wrap.  Chill for at
  least 30 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.  When the pastry has
  chilled, roll it out on a pastry board to a thickness of 1/8-inch. The
  easiest way is to roll the dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper. Roll the
  dough up onto the rolling pin and transfer it to a 9-inch pie tin. Gently
  press it into the tin without stretching it.  Use the excess pastry to make
  flutes or cut away the excess with a sharp knife or scissors. Prick the
  bottom of the pastry shell thoroughly to prevent trapped air from bubbling
  the dough.  Butter a sheet of aluminum foil and place the foil down into
  the shell.  Weight it down with weights or beans to keep the crust from
  lifting up.  Bake the crust for 7 to 10 minutes then remove the weight and
  the foil.  Return the crust to the oven and continue baking for another 8
  to 10 minutes or until the crust is lightly browned. If you have difficulty
  rolling out the dough, do not reroll it; just patch the tears or holes.
  Rerolling will make the pastry tough. FILLING: Preheat the oven to 350
  degrees F.  Press the cottage cheese through a sieve. In a small saucepan,
  gently heat the cream and the sherry until steamy, do not allow it to
  scorch.  In a mixing bowl, beat together the eggs, egg yolks, sugar,
  rosewater, and the spices until frothy -- about 5 minutes. In a large
  mixing bowl, beat the cottage cheese until it is smooth then add the egg
  mixture and blend well.  Add the hot cream and sherry slowly to the cheese
  mixture and beat until well blended.  Stir in the currants and pour the
  mixture into the prepared crust.  Bake for about 30 minutes, then allow to
  cool.  Chill and sprinkle with cinnamon.

  *      Use Sweet Cream Butter In this recipe. ** Note: This recipe can vary
  depending on the type of pan you use.
  ~-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Butter the baking dish, pie pan, or springform pan until generously coated.
  Sprinkle the crumbs as needed into the pan, then turn the pan around and
  shake gently, distributing the crumbs along the sides as well. The crumbs
  should completely coat the inside of the pan.  Chill briefly to set the
  crumbs and then fill with the desired filling. CAKE: Preheat the oven to
  325 degrees F.  Sift together the flour and baking powder and set aside.
  Press the cottage cheese through a sieve.  In a large mixing bowl, beat the

      Yield: 10 servings
 
-----------------------------------CRUST-----------------------------------
      1 x  NONE                          

---------------------------------CHEESECAKE---------------------------------
      6 c  Farmers Cheese; 3 Lbs, *            6 ea Egg Yolks; Large
  1 1/2 c  Confectioners' Sugar            1 1/2 c  Heavy Cream
    1/2 c  Candied Fruits                    1/2 c  Raisins; Seedless
    1/2 c  Almonds; Toasted, Slivered        1/2 ts Lemon Rind; Grated
    1/2 lb Butter; NO Margarine                3 ts Vanilla Extract

-------------------------------SABAYON SAUCE-------------------------------
      2 ea Egg Yolks; Large                  1/4 c  Madeira
    1/2 ts Lemon Rind; Grated                  3 tb Confectioners' Sugar
      1 tb Lemon Juice                         1 tb Rum; Light
 
  *    You can also use Large-Curd Cottage Cheese if the Farmers Cheese is
  ~-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE:  THIS IS A SPECIAL CAKE REQUIRING A NEW LARGE FLOWER POT 7 X 7-INCHES
  AT A MINIMUM. Press the cheese through a sieve. Combine the cheese with the
  egg yolks, beating in 1 yolk at a time. Add the sugar and blend well. Heat
  the cream in a large saucepan until it almost boils, then add the cheese
  mixture and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture
  thickens.  Remove from the heat before it begins to boil.  Stir in the
  fruits, almonds, and lemon rind.  Cool.  Cream together the butter and the
  vanilla, then stir into the cooled cheese mixture.  Line the flower pot
  with several layers of moistened cheesecloth, leaving enough cloth at the
  top to form a flap that will cover the pot.  Fill the pot with the cheese
  mixture and cover with the flap.  Put a weight on the top and place in the
  refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.  The whey (liquid) will drip out the bottom
  of the pot, so be sure to place a pan under it.  When drained, carefully
  unmold the cake with a knife.  Remove the cheesecloth and smooth the sides
  with a hot knife.  Prepare the sauce.  Beat together the egg yolks, sugar,
  Madeira, and lemon rind in the top of a double boiler.  Cook and continue
  beating until the mixture thickens.  Stir in the lemon juice and the rum,
  then chill briefly.  Pour the sauce over the cheesecake and serve. NOTE:
  This very unusual cheesecake is a traditional Russian Easter dish.  In the
  old days, the custom was to decorate it with paper flowers or religious
  emblems and have the priest come by and bless it.  Back then, it was made
  in a special pyramid-shaped form, but you can make it in an ordinary red
  clay flower pot.  Visually, the effect is quite striking, and the drainage
  hole allows the excess whey to escape.  To make paskha, you will need a
  large flower pot and some cheesecloth.  The paskha will keep in the
  refrigerator for several weeks, but be sure to make it at least three days
  in advance.

      Title: Shortbread Crust
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Unbleached Flour; Sifted            1 x  Sugar; Granulated, *
      1 ea Egg; Large, Separated, **         1/2 c  Butter; Softened, ***
 
  *     Use from 1/4 to 1/3 cup of granulated sugar. (To Taste.) ** Separate
  the large egg and lightly beat the yolk. *** Use only sweet cream, unsalted
  butter in this recipe.  NO MARGARINE.
  ~-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Working on a large flat surface, such
  as a pastry board, place the flour and the sugar in the center of the
  surface and mix together.  Form a small depression or well in the center of
  the mound.  Add the beaten egg yolk and the softened butter to the well,
  ten blend these with the dry mixture.  Mix the ingredients thoroughly using
  your hands -- there's no substitute for warm hands. Shape the dough into a
  ball and wrap in plastic wrap.  Chill for at least 10 minutes. Roll out the
  dough to a thickness of about 1/4-inch.  You should have a circle of about
  11 inches in diameter.  For best results, roll out your dough between 2
  sheets of waxed paper, then peel away the paper and cut the crust in a
  9-inch circle.  Place the circle inside a 9-inch springform pan. Prick the
  crust several times with a fork to keep the crust from puffing up during
  the baking.  Place the springform pan in the oven and bake for 15 to 20
  minutes, or until light brown.  Allow to cool. Using the leftover dough,
  line the sides of the springform pan. Press the dough against the sides of
  the pan, smoothing it so as to have a continuous layer of crust all the way
  around the sides of the pan.  Make sure that the side crust meets the
  bottom crust all the way around.  Brush the reserved egg white onto the
  shell, covering the bottom and sides. This will seal the dough and keep it
  from becoming soggy.  Set aside until ready to use. NOTE: For the Italian
  Cheesecake, add 1 ts of grated lemon rind and 1 ts of Amaretto Liqueur when
  adding the egg yolk and butter.

---------------------------------BASIC RIBS---------------------------------
      3 lb Country Ribs or other               1 c  Cider Vinegar
      2 tb Black Pepper fine ground            2 tb Garlic Salt

----------------------------SAUCE FOR RE-HEATING----------------------------
      1 ea Open Pit small bottle               1 ea Small Bottle A-1 Sauce
    1/4 c  Molasses                            1 ea Supply of Hickory Chips
 
  Regular old supermarket pork. Spare ribs, country ribs, or any other pork
  Not too much fat. Cut off any gross excess, and cut them to EVEN thickness.
  You'll ruin everything if you cook the meat unevenly. You may compensate by
  scoring the meat. In a large baking pan, soak the ribs with cider vinegar,
  after which sprinkle them with garlic salt and finely ground black pepper.
  (Don't use pepper mills, or other peppers.) It doesn't seem to matter how
  long the ribs soak, or how much vinegar is on them. Just make sure it hits
  all sides, you don't have to puncture them. This sweetens the meat. The key
  to the fire is the hickory chips. Keep feeding these amazing little fellows
  to the charcoal. The flavor comes out of these chips and you cannot do
  without them. Make sure the fat and chips don't light up your whole dinner
  and ruin it. Cooking: A moderate hot fire a couple of inches or more from
  the meat, and a grill of reasonable cleanness. As the meat cooks turn it
  often, do not let it burn, do not baste it with anything. Don't cover the
  grill and don't stray too far -- fire is always hiding in the wings. Here
  is the catch -- the trick -- the hard part, is the timing. You may ruin
  some meals before you hit it, but the time to take them off the grill is
  one minute after trichina danger is past. As soon as the meat turns brown
  it's time to eat. You can use the small strips you cut off to judge just
  when things are perfect. Special Purpose Sauce: (don't eat it cold, it's
  awful) 1 bottle Open Pit, One bottle A-1 Sauce, 1/4 C of molasses. Start
  re-heating the sauce until slow boil, dump in the cold pork from the
  fridge. alt. without sauce wrap the meat in foil and heat at 325 oven for
  15-20 minutes. Sauce can be stored and re-used, but remember it will have
  pork fat in it now.

  until sugar is a dark, caramel-colored liquid. Remove from heat and pour
  into a 4 cup metal ring mold or 8 individual molds. Quickly turn mold to
  coat bottom and sides with the caramel. Let cool so caramel hardens. Heat
  oven to 325. Put the condensed milk, milk, eggs, egg yolks and flavorings
  into an electric blender. Cover and blend to mix well. Pour mixture into
  mold; put mold in a larger pan filled with water to depth of 1/2 inch. Bake
  for 1 hour. Remove from oven and remove mold from water. Cool and then
  refrigerate up to 2 days. Cover mold with an inverted serving platter. Hold
  mold and platter together and turn them over. Lift off mold. Caramel will
  fall as a liquid sauce over the custard. Source: CRS file

  Discard any dead crayfish in the sack. Wash crayfish in clean, cool water
  just before cooking. They do not need to be purged with salt during
  washing.   Place the live crayfish in boiling water and boil for 10
  minutes. (Season the water with one pound of salt per five gallons of
  water. Add other seasoning to taste, including cayenne, garlic, onions,
  lemons, lemon juice and crab boil.) Don't begin timing cooking until watter
  returns to a buil after adding crayfish. It's usual to add potatoes and
  corn on the cob to the boil. Crayfish are easiest to peel when still warm.

      Yield: 5 servings
 
      1 c  Butter                              1 c  Creamed cottage cheese
      2 c  Flour                             1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Fruit filling (see below)           1 x  -----pineapple filling------
      1 c  (9 oz can) crushed pineapple      1/3 c  Sugar
      1 tb Cornstarch                          1 x  ------apricot filling-------
      1 c  Chopped dried apricots            1/4 c  Sugar
      2 tb Butter                            1/8 ts Cinnamon
 
    These are very simple, but you will find NO better cookie anywhere! On
  the down side, they do require advanced preparation (overnight is best).
  Included are a couple of filling recipes, but a can of pre-made will work
  too. (Apricot is best)   When rolling out dough, try to keep it as chilled
  as possible. To cream the cottage cheese, it helps if you have a food
  processor or blender, but a fork and a strong arm will do in a pinch. Mix
  ingredients and chill at least 6 hours. Roll to 1/4" thickness. Cut into 2
  or 3 inch squares, and place filling or preserves in center of square.
  Bring corners over filling and seal together. Bake at 350 - 25 to 30
  minutes. Remove and dust with powdered sugar. Pineapple Filling: Combine
  ingredients in sauce pan, cook stirring constantly until thickened. Cool.
  Apricot Filling: Simmer apricot 10 minutes. Add sugar and simmer 10 minutes
  more. Remove from heat and add butter and cinnamon. Cool.

  minutes stirring occasionally. Pour in the coconut mild, bring to a boil,
  and simmer partially covered for 20 minutes, or until the lamb is tender.
