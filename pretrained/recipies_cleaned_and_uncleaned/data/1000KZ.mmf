      6 oz Bacon; diced
      1    Yellow onion; peel/dice
      1    Red bell pepper; dice
      2    Stalks celery; dice
    1/4 bn Fresh thyme; chopped

      1 ts Fresh ground pepper
    1/2 bn Scallions; sliced thin
    1/4 bn Parsley; chopped
           Chopped smoked almonds
 
  Render the diced bacon until crispy; drain and
  reserve.  Using a little of the bacon fat, slowly
  sweat the celery, onion and peppers with 1/4 teaspoon
  salt. When soft, add the garlic and chopped herbs and
  cook until fragrant, about 2  minutes. Add the flour
  and cook for another 2 minutes. Add in a third of the
  stock, bring to a boil stirring constantly, add the

  should be soft but still hold its shape. Season with
  salt  and pepper. Off the heat, add the scallions, the
  bacon and  parsley, garnish with toasted or smoked
  chopped almonds or walnuts for a nice crunch.

 Categories: Greek, Desserts
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      1 lb Commercial raw kadaifi dough
    1/2 c  Sweet butter; melted
  1 1/2 c  Finely chopped almonds *
  3 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
           Ground cinnamon
    1/2 c  Orange juice (optional)
      2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Honey
      2 tb Lemon juice
 
  *Note: Use blanched almonds.
  
  Open the raw kadaifi dough to the air for 10 to 15
  minutes.  Spread half the pastry evenly over the
  bottom of a 9 x 12 x 3-inch baking pan and brush with
  half the butter.  Meanwhile, combine the almonds, 1/2
  cup sugar, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, and orange juice in
  a small bowl.  (The orange juice will make the mixture
  like a paste that can be spread with a knife.) Spread
  the almond mixture over the kadaifi and cover with the
  remaining dough. Brush with the remaining butter and
  bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 40 minutes or
  slightly longer, until golden on top.
  
  Meanwhile, boil the remaining 3 cups sugar with water
  for 5 minutes.  Stir in the honey and lemon juice,
  bring to a boil and keep hot.  When done, remove the
  pastry to a rack to cool in the pan, then spoon the
  hot syrup over the pastry.  Cover with a dry towel and
  allow to cool thoroughly. When cool, cut into square
  or diamond shapes of any desired size.  Dust with
  additional ground cinnamon just before serving on
  dessert plates.

      2 c  Granulated sugar
  1 1/2 c  Water
    1/2    Lemon; strained juice only

MMMMM------------------------CHOUX PASTRY-----------------------------
      1 c  Plain flour
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Water
    1/4 c  Butter
      2 lg Eggs; lightly beaten
    1/8 ts Almond essence

MMMMM-------------------------TO FINISH------------------------------
           Oil; for shaping and frying
           Whipped cream or kaymak
           -(kaymak is clotted cream)
    1/4 c  Blanched pistachio nuts
           -(finely chopped)
 
  In a heavy pan dissolve sugar in water over medium
  heat, stirring occasionally.  Bring to the boil, add
  lemon juice and boil rapidly, without stirring, for 15
  minutes.  Leave syrup in pan to cool. Sift flour and
  salt onto a square of stiff paper. In another heavy
  pan heat water and butter until boiling.  Pour in
  flour all at once, stirring constantly with a wooden
  spoon or balloon whisk. Keep stirring until mixture
  leaves sides of pan, then cook on low heat, stirring
  occasionally, for further 5 minutes.  Remove roux from
  heat and turn into a bowl.  Cool for 2 minutes then
  gradually beat in eggs.  Add almond essence and beat
  until smooth and satiny.  A balloon whisk will break
  up lumps, a wooden spoon is better for beating to a
  smooth finish, so utilize the two for the process.
  Oil hands and take pieces of dough the size of a
  walnut.  Roll into smooth balls and place on an oiled
  tray.  Flatten into rounds about 5 cm (2 inches) in
  diameter and press oiled forefinger into centre of
  each to make a hole.  Keep hands oiled during shaping
  so that dough will not stick. Place enough oil in a
  large electric frypan to come to a depth of 1 cm (1/2
  inch).  Heat until just warm and place half of the
  prepared gobegi into oil.  Increase heat to 200oC
  (400oF) as soon as they are added.  When gobegi rise
  to the surface and are puffed, turn them over. Fry
  them for 15 minutes in all, timed from when the gobegi
  are first placed into pan. Turn frequently during last
  half of cooking time so that they brown evenly.
  When cooked, remove from oil with a slotted spoon and
  drain briefly on paper towels.  Put into syrup, turn
  them and leave for 5 minutes before removing to a
  plate. Turn off frypan and allow oil to cool before
  adding second lot. To serve, arrange gobegi on a flat
  platter and place a dollop of whipped cream or kaymak
  in the center.  Sprinkle with pistachio nuts. NOTE: If
  you have no electric frypan, use a large frying pan
  set on a thermostatically controlled hot plate or
  burner.  Otherwise use an ordinary burner, start at
  low and increase heat to midway between medium and
  high settings. Variation: Dilber Dudagi (Lips of the
  Beauty) Follow above directions, but flatten the balls
  of dough in your hand to a 6 cm (2-1/2 inch) round and
  fold dough over so that pastry resembles lips on
  curved edge.  Place on an oiled tray until all are
  shaped.  Fry and finish as for Kadin Gobegi.  Serve
  plain or with whipped cream or kaymak.

 Categories: Curry, Thai, Colonel's
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Curry paste---
      2 tb Takrai (lemon grass) --
           Bruised, and thinly
           Sliced
      3 tb Shallots -- coarsely
           Chopped
      2 tb Kratiem (garlic) -- chopped
           Quarter cup kachai (lesser
           Ginger) -- peeled and
           Chopped
      8    Prik chee fa daegn haeng
           (dried red Thai -- crushed
           Jalapenas)
      1 ts Green peppercorns
      1 ts Kapi (fermented shrimp
           Paste)
           Dash of fish sauce
           Curry----
      4 c  Chicken -- cut in 1" pieces
    1/4 c  Nam pla(fish sauce)
      3 c  Chicken stock or water
    1/2 c  Makhua pro(thai eggplant)
    1/4 c  Prik che fa(Thai jalaenas)
           Julienned
    1/2 c  Bai maenglak(kaffir lime
           Leaves) -- shredded or
      1 ts Lime zest
      4    Coconut
 
  FOR THE CURRY method First prepare the curry paste by
  grinding the ingredients to a fine paste in a mortar
  and pestle or food processor. Pierce the coconuts and
  drain the juice into a picher. Then using a machete
  chop off the top of each coconut, just above the
  mid-point, to leave four serving bowls. Using a spoon
  scoop out the coconut 'meat' in leaf shaped pieces
  with a spoon (or use a melon baller). Add about half a
  cup of coconut to the juice for every two cups of
  juice, and refrigerate. Reserve half a cup of coconut
  meat, and reserve the rest to make coconut milk for
  other recipes. Heat a wok or large sautee pan over
  medium high heat, and then add a little oil and stir
  fry the curry paste until aromatic. add the chicken,
  and stir fry briefly and then add the remaining
  ingredients, except the lime leaves and the chicken
  stock, and stir fry until the chicken begins to change
  colour. Add the stock, and cover, simmering until the
  chicken and the eggplant is cooked through. Now serve
  the curry in the four large coconut shell bowls,
  garnished with the lime leaves, and accompanied by
  rice in the tops of the coconut shells, bring the
  chilled coconut nectar to the table as a refreshing
  cool drink, and don't forget the usual condiments (nam
  pla prik (chilis in fish sauce), dried ground chilis,
  and sugar). -- Colonel Ian F. Khuntilanont-Philpott

  A recent trip to Bangkok resulted in our eating at a
  nice little restaurant in a back alley near the
  airport. This dish is quite common, but both my wife
  and I were taken by the presentation described hear
  (the rest of the recipe is however my wife's).
  
  Of course before you rush out to try this, I have to
  say that you need a heavy, and very sharp knife - a
  machete or a survivalist's Bowie might be suitable -
  and a degree of skill in its use if you are not to
  have a messy accident - spilling the contents of the
  coconuts all over the kitchen may well be the least of
  your problems. So of course I point out that you can
  open the coconuts some other way, and serve the dish
  in more conventional tableware!
  
  kachai is a relative of ginger, known as Lesser Ginger
  in some parts of the world (though I am reminded that
  in other places this appelation is used for galangal).
  For those of a botanical bent its latin name is
  Kaempferia Panduratum.
  
  The prik chee fa are a mild chili, about 6 centimetres
  long and 1 cm thick. They are known as Thai jalapenas,
  and if unavailable the Mexican variety could be
  substituted. If dried red jalapenas are not available,
  deseed, and devein fresh jalapenas, and use them
  instead.
  
  Makheua pro are a Thai variety of eggplant, about the
  size and shape of a green golfball. If unavailable you
  can use normal aubergine, but will need to adjust the
  cooking time.
  
  bai maenglak is a sweet Thai basil. If unavailable
  normal european basil may be used.

 Categories: Thailand, Ham/pork
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
    1/2 lb Pork tenderloin, trimmed
      1 ts Vegetable oil
      1 tb Minced garlic (3 cloves)
      3 tb Jungle Curry Paste (recipe
           -follows)
      2 c  Defatted chicken stock
    1/2 lb Chinese eggplant, coarsely
           -chopped
    1/2 lb Long beans, trimmed, cut
           -into I inch pieces
      2 tb Fish sauce
    1/4 c  Thinly sliced fresh krachai
           -or:
      2 tb Loosely packed dried *
      2    Fresh kaffir lime leaves or:
      4    Dried **
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh basil
 
  * soaked in warm water for 15 minutes, drained and
  sliced (optional) ** soaked in warm water for 20
  minutes and drained, or I tsp. grated lime zest
  
  Unlike most other Thai curries, jungle Curry is made
  without coconut milk because coconuts don't grow in
  the jungles of northern Thailand. The curry paste is
  hot and full of flavor. Kaffir lime leaves give this
  curry its distinctive and enticing flavor, but if they
  are not available, you can substitute grated lime Zest.
  
  Cut pork in half lengthwise and cut into
  1/4-inch-thick slices. Set aside. In a large, nonstick
  skillet or wok, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add
  garlic and stir-fry for 2 minutes, or until browned.
  Add curry paste and cook for 30 seconds, pressing it
  against the sides and bottom of the skillet or wok.
  Add pork and stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until
  light brown.  Add stock and bring to a boil. Add
  eggplant, beans, fish sauce, krachai (if using) and
  lime leaves or zest, and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, or
  until the vegetables are tender. If using lime leaves,
  discard them. Remove from heat and stir in basil.
  Serve with sticky rice.

  "The flavor of commercial buttermilk varies enormously
  from dairy to dairy. Natural fresh buttermilk, if
  available, would be ideal for this unusual summer
  luncheon or dessert soup, but cultured buttermilk of
  good flavor will do almost as well." With an electric
  beater or wire whisk, beat the egg yolks in a large
  bowl. Gradually add the sugar, beating until the eggs
  fall back into the bowl in a lazy ribbon when the
  beater is lifted. Add the grated lemon rind and juice
  and the optional vanilla. Slowly beat in the
  buttermilk, continuing to beat until the soup is
  smooth. Serve in chilled bowls and float a spoonfull
  of unsweetened whipped cream on the surface of each
  service if you like. Buttermilk soup is traditionally
  served with Oat Cakes. (See recipe.)

 Categories: Beans
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
 
        1 lb dried navy beans, picked
  :          over -- rinsed
      1/2 lb bacon slices, cut in pieces
  :          with scissors
        2 c  onion -- finely chopped
        1    12-oz bottle  chili sauce
      1/2 c  tomato-based barbeque sauce,
  :          preferably
  :          smoked
      1/2 c  Kahlua
      1/2 c  strong brewed coffee
      1/4 c  dijon mustard
      1/4 c  unsulfered molasses
        2 TB thick, spicy steak sauce,
  :          such as Heinz 57
        2 TB Tabasco sauce
        1 ts salt
  
  1.  Soak the beans in lots of water to cover
  overnight.  Drain. 2. In a large pot, cover beans
  generously with fresh cold water.  Set the pot over
  medium heat and bring the water to a boil, then lower
  the heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring once or
  twice, for 1 hour or more, until the beans are very
  soft but still holding their shape.  (The beans should
  not be salted at the initial cooking stage, as salt
  will toughen the beans.) Drain, reserving 1 1/2 cups
  of the bean cooking liquid. 3. Cook the bacon in a
  large skillet until crispy.  Remove the bacon from the
  pan and pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat.  Add
  the onions and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
  4. Combine the beans with 1 1/2 cups cooking liquid,
  bacon, onions, chili sauce, barbeque sauce, Kahlua,
  coffee, mustard, molasses, steak sauce, Tabasco and
  salt. Transfer to a heavy 5 quart nonreactive
  casserole or Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid. Bake
  in a preheated 350 degree oven for 30 minutes. 5.
  Remove the lid, stir the beans and continue baking,
  uncovered, 30 minutes. Stir and continue baking 40
  minutes, until beans are very thick. Stir
  occasionally. (The beans can be cooled, covered and
  refrigerated; reheat the next day on a medium-low
  burner.)

  (FIRST LAYER): Cook both packages of pudding using
  only 3 cups milk, cool and spread on crust.
  (SECOND LAYER): Make both packages of vanilla pudding
  using only 2 cups of milk and mix in Kahlua.
  In another bowl, make whipped cream or whip 2
  envelopes of Dream Whip according to package
  directions. Gently fold the instant pudding and
  whipped cream together. Put the vanilla mixture over
  the chocolate layer. Top with crumbs or grated
  chocolate bar. Make in a 9 x 13 pan or halve the
  recipe in an 8 x 8 pan. Tip from Lynne - put in
  freezer for approx. 15 minutes to firm up to make
  serving easier (it does firm up by the second day).
  Tip from Cousin Anne - Don't try to be overly generous
  with the Kahlua, because she tried and it wasn't as
  good. Tip from Joan - Make sure you have lots of milk
  on hand as the Dream Whip requires it too.

  from the heat and let it cool. BE Sure to keep it
  covered. Store in any empty 750 ml liquor bottle with
  a screw top or another bottle with a resealable lid.
  It is very important that you use a covered saucepan
  when making this  drink. The alcohol will boil away if
  the solution is not covered when it  gets hot. Also
  the longer this drink is bottled and stored in a dark,
  cool, place the better it will taste. For the bet
  flavor, store it for at least 30 days before drinking.
  Probably the hardest part of making this simple
  receipe is not drinking it before it matures.

      Title: KAI KEM (SALTY EGGS)
 Categories: Thai, Eggs
      Yield: 9 Servings
 
      4 c  Water
      1 c  Salt
      9    Duck eggs or chicken eggs
 
  Info:  from "Real Thai" by Nancy McDermott posted by
  Perry Lowell
  
  This Chinese invention is loved by Thais, who serve
  salty eggs as a contrast to the incendiary heat of a
  green curry or a bland dish.  Kai kem is traditionally
  made with duck's eggs, which are cured for several
  weeks in a simple salt brine.  Once cured, they keep
  for many months at room temperature, and are boiled
  when it's time to eat them.
  
  In a medium saucepan, combine the water and salt and
  stir well with a large spoon to dissolve some of the
  salt.  Place over medium heat and bring to a boil,
  stirring frequently.  After mixture boils rigorously
  for about 1 minute, remove from the heat, stir once
  more, and cool to room temperature.
  
  Gently arrange the eggs in a crock or large jar.  Pour
  the cooled brine over the eggs, making sure they are
  completely submerged. Cover and keep in a cool place
  for 1 month.
  
  When you're ready to use the eggs, place the number of
  eggs you want in a small pan and add cold water to
  cover. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. When the
  water reaches a rolling boil, reduce the heat to low
  and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool
  to room temperature. Peel and serve.
  
  Note:  Salty or Salted Eggs are sold uncooked in Asian
  markets.  Often they are covered with 1/4-inch layer
  of charcoal colored ash. Rinse off the ash and cook as
  above.

      Title: KAI SAI TAKRAI (CHICKEN & LEMON GRASS)
 Categories: Thai, Chicken, Poultry, Chiles
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Chicken, cut into
           -bite sized pieces.
      2 tb Lime juice
      2 tb Fish sauce
      2 tb Sliced lemon grass
      1 tb Sliced shallot
           -(purple onions)
      2 tb Diced 'spanish' onion
      1 tb Scallion/green onion
           -thinly sliced
      1 tb Thinly sliced garlic
      1 ts Prik phom (freshly
           Ground dried red chilis)
      2 tb Chicken stock
      1 tb Thinly sliced prik ki
           Nu daeng (red birdseye
           -chilis)
      1 ts Sugar
      1    Bai makroot (kaffir
           -lime leaf), shredded
 
  This dish has a nice poetic name, as the three words
  of the name rhyme. Those who don't like chili can
  always leave it out. Method:
  Mix the lime juice and fish sauce, and marinate the
  chicken for about an hour.
  Pound the lemon grass with a mallet or meat tenderizer
  and then very thinly slice it.
  Heat a little oil in a wok or skillet to medium high
  heat, add the shallots, onions, garlic, prik phom and
  lemon grass, and stir fry until aromatic.
  Add the chicken and marinade and stir fry until it
  starts to change color.  Add the remaining ingredients
  and stir fry until heated through and the chicken is
  fully cooked. Serve with steamed [jasmine] rice.
  This dish can also be made with shrimp (kung sai
  takrai).

      Title: KAI'S SPINACH PIE <R T>
 Categories: Casseroles, Main dishes, Fatfree, Italian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 pk Fresh spinach
      1 pk Fresh mushrooms
      1 lg Onion
      5    Egg whites; or substitute
      8 oz Fatfree cheddar cheese; grat
      8 oz Fatfree mozzarella cheese; g
      1 ts Pepper
      1    Phyllo dough; *see note
 
  Remove stems from spinach and wash. Cut onions and
  saute in water until tender. Wash and slice mushrooms
  and add to the onions (cook until all water
  evaporates). Remove onions &   mushrooms from heat a
  put in a large bowl. Saute spinach in water tossing
  frequently until all liquid evaporates. Mix
  onions/mushrooms & spinach together in bowl & make
  sure onions and mushrooms are evenly distributed
  throughout the spinach. Beat egg whites lightly.  Add
  grated cheese to egg mixture and mix thoroughly. Add
  spinach mixture to egg and cheese mixture and stir
  until mixed well.
  
  CRUST: The dough is paper thin and you use many
  layers. I use a rectangular glass baking dish, sprayed
  lightly with - PAM.  Quickly layer 5-7 sheets on the
  bottom of the dish spraying each layer lightly with
  Pam.  Then put half of your spinach mixture on top.
  Put another 5-7 sheets of Phyllo. Then the last of
  your spinach mixture.  Top with 10 to 15 sheets of
  phyllo, sprayed lightly with Pam between each layer.
  Remove any excess dough around the edges.  Moisten
  your fingertips and seal around the edges like a
  normal pie crust.  Spray top lightly with Pam.  Using
  a sharp knife cut through the top layer in the pattern
  you want.  (ie: I cut rectangular pattern that is the
  size of the pieces I will ultimately cut.)   In the
  Greek desert, Baklava they cut diamond shapes. Bake in
  400-425 deg. F. oven for 30 min.
  
  WARNING:  Phyllo dough is sooooo thin it is a little
  hard to work with because it dries out in about 2
  seconds and sticks together.  There are hints on the
  box on how to keep it moist.
  
  Use HEALTHY CHOICE FAT FREE grated cheeses.  Their
  cheese is real cheese made with skim milk, it tastes
  and melts the same (at least in this recipe) as high
  fat cheeses which is not true for other brand name Fat
  Free Cheeses I have tried.

           Mushrooms or 2 packs of
           Fresh

  Cook rice in rice cooker.
  
  Heat non-stick skillet till very hot. Throw in veggies
  and more diced fresh garlic, ginger and pepper.
   (High heat with NO oil brings out flavors in veggies,
  according to Chef Prudhomme)
  
  Stir quickly, as they begin to become tender add rice
  wine a little at a time, just to prevent
  sticking/burning, not enough to make the veggies soggy.
  
  Throw the cooked rice from the rice cooker into a big
  bowl, throw in the veggies, toss around.
  
  Add chopped scallions (uncooked, the heat from the
  other stuff is enough).
  
  Toss about to evenly distribute ingredients.
  
  Add the Fried Rice Seasoning Packet,  Toss and serve.

      Title: KALAKUKKO
 Categories: Fish, Finnish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      2 lb Fish, small
  1 1/2 lb Pork, sliced into
           -strips like bacon,
           -but about 1/4 to 1/2
           -inch thick
      3 tb Salt (omit salt if
           -pork is already salted)
           Allspice (optional;
           -traditionalists omit
           -this)

MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
  2 1/2 c  Water
  3 1/4 c  Rye flour (sifted)
  1 3/4 c  Wheat flour, about
           -(sifted)
      4 ts Salt
    1/2 oz Yeast (2 standard
           -packages)
 
  Clean the fish, removing fins, large scales and
  entrails.  You may leave the heads if you dare to eat
  them.
  
  Mix the flours and salt.  Add the yeast to the water.
  When the yeast is fully dissolved, make a thick dough
  by pouring flour mixture into water and blending well.
  The ratio of flour to water depends on the nature of
  the flours. This ratio of 1:2 by volume works well in
  Finland with Finnish flours.  Where flours contain
  more gluten you should use slightly less water.
  
  Set aside about 4 T of dough to be used later.  Roll
  out the remaining dough into a circular shape about
      3/4    inch thick.
  
  Assemble the meats into the dough:  cover the inner
  half of the dough circle with half of the pork (the
  pork should cover a circle whose diameter is half the
  diameter of the rolled dough). Then put all of the
  fish over top of the pork, and add allspice and extra
  salt if you are using them. Finish with the second
  half of the pork.
  
  Preheat oven to 500 degrees F.  Lift the edges of the
  dough all around the filling and glue together with a
  little water so that you have the filling surrounded
  from all directions with about 3/4-inch-thick dough.
  Put upside down (the seam downwards) on a baking sheet
  and let it rise about half an hour at room temperature.
  
  Put the kalakukko in a 500 degree F. oven for long
  enough to brown the dough, which will seal it against
  moisture. Then lower the temperature to about 250
  degrees F. and let it bake for 4 to 7 hours depending
  on the size of the fish (bigger fish need more cooking
  time). You can brush some melted butter over the top
  of the dough just after lowering the temperature; this
  will give it a prettier appearance. If it starts to
  leak while baking, fill holes with the dough which was
  set aside.
  
  Serve hot or cold.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Rye bread pie with fish and pork filling -- This is
  an ancient national food prepared and eaten in Savo
  (eastern Finland).
  
  *  Kalakukko was used as travelers' food because it
  stays edible very long when unopened.  Also in
  medieval times salt was the only way to preserve meat
  and it was expensive, so with this way you could use
  all the salt in salt pork. The word kala-kukko means
  fish-cock (the bird).
  
  *  You can use any small fish (shorter than about 8
  inches).  Small scales and spikes don't matter because
  they soften during the prolonged cooking. Make sure
  you use un-smoked pork.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (some skill with dough is
  required). : Time:  45 minutes preparation, 30 minutes
  attended baking, 4-7 hours unattended baking.
  : Precision:  Careful measurement not necessary, but
  the consistency of the dough (which will depend on the
  nature of your flours) is important.  If the dough is
  either too soft or too hard, the kalakukko will leak.

 Categories: Soups, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      7 c  Water
      1 lg Bunch kale
  1 1/4 lb Red potatoes
           Salt
      2    Bay leaves
      3 tb Virgin olive oil
      1 md Red or yellow onion
           - diced into 1/2-in squares
      6    Garlic cloves; sliced
    1/2 ts Red pepper flakes
           Freshly ground pepper
           Finely chopped parsley
           - for garnish
 
  HEAT WATER IN LARGE PAN. Meanwhile, with sharp knife,
  remove stems of ruffled kale leaves. Chop stems into
  1-inch long pieces and add them to the water. Cut
  leaves into pieces about 2-inch square, wash well and
  set aside. Scrub and peel potatoes and add peels to
  heating water along with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 bay
  leaf. When water boils, lower heat and let it simmer
  while you assemble remaining ingredients. Cut peeled
  potatoes into pieces about 1/2-inch square. Heat oil
  in soup pot, add onion, garlic, red pepper flakes and
  remaining bay leaf. Cook over medium-high heat 3 or 4
  minutes, stirring frequently, then season with salt.
  Stir in potatoes and 1 cup strained simmering stock.
  Cover and cook slowly 5 minutes. Add kale, cover again
  and steam until leaves are wilted, stirring once or
  twice. Strain remaining stock into soup pot. Bring to
  boil, reduce heat and simmer slowly, covered, until
  potatoes are soft, about 30 minutes. Use back of
  wooden spoon to break up potatoes by pressing them
  against sides of pot or puree 1 or 2 cups soup in
  blender and return it to pot to make unifying
  background for other elements. Taste soup and season
  to taste with salt and generous grinding of pepper. If
  possible, set soup aside 1 hour to allow flavors to
  merge and develop even further, then serve with light
  sprinkling of parsley.

 Categories: Dutch, Casseroles, Main dish, Vegetables, Sausage
      Yield: 1 Casserole
 
      2 lb Or 3, curly kale
      3 lb Potatoes
           Milk
           Salt
      1 lb Smoked sausage or
           -Frankfurters
      4 tb Fat, butter, or margarine
           Pepper
 
  Strip, wash and cut up the kale very finely.  Boil
  kale in little boiling water with salt, about 40
  minutes.  Add peeled and cut potatoes and sausage and
  enough water to prevent burning (cooking time 30
  minutes). Remove sausage from pan, mash remainder and
  stir in boiled milk until smooth. Taste, add some
  pepper if desired.
  
  "Stamppot" means that the vegetables and potatoes are
  mixed to a smooth consistency.  It is a typical
  winterdish at home and the Dutch have a saying: never
  eat curly kale before the frost has got at it.

  soft dough.  Knead until smooth and elastic, then
  break off small pieces and roll as thin of a dime.
  (The dough will be elastic and can be rolled easily.)
  Cut into circles 4-inches in diameter (teacup size),
  then on each circle place a teaspoon of the cheese
  filling.  Wet the circle edge with water or milk and
  fold over to form a half-moon, then seal with the
  tines of a fork or pastry wheel.  Arrange the
  Kaltisounia on buttered cookie sheets and bake in a
  moderate oven (350 F) for 25 minutes, or until the
  pastry puffs up and turns a light chestnut color.
  Remove from the oven, and place on racks, and dust
  with confectioners' sugar and cinnamon.  Serve hot or
  cold.

  1 1/2 c  Fresh mizithra or ricotta
      2 tb Grated hard ricotta
      2    Eggs; separated
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      2 tb Butter; melted

      2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 pn Salt
      1 ts Vanilla extract
           Confectioners' sugar
 
  For the filling, combine the cheeses, lightly beaten egg yolks,
  sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and melted butter in a bowl. The

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Lemon juice
      3 tb Sugar
      1    Lemon
      2 pk Moselle wine
      1 pk Champagne
 
   Chill wine and champagne.
  
   Chill glass punch bowl thoroughly in refrigerator or
  by filling with ice.  When cold, dissolve suger in
  lemon juice in it. Peel lemon in spiral, with top of
  lemon left on.  Rub lemon spiral around sides of bowl
  and leave peel in bowl, hanging top end over edge.
  Pour wine over peel and let stand in refrigerator,
  15-20 minutes.  Add chilled champagne.
  
   Serve in glass punch cups, with 1-2 small ice cubes
  in each cup.
   If you like a greater sparkle, add a glass of club
  soda.
  
   This is the original of the now popular bottled wine
  drink.
   Classically, it is made with white wine and German
  champagne.
   The spiral of lemon peel, cut with the top of the
  lemon left on to be hung over the side of the punch
  bowl, is the "cold duck" that inspired the drink's
  name. The homemade version is an elegant far cry from
  the insipid bottled version.

  I was browsing through my book on Asian foods
  today++nothing in surimi as such, but here's what it
  says about Kameboko which is very similar, if not the
  same thing...  I suspect the process for making surimi
  is much the same.
  
  Firm, slightly rubbery-textured cakes of ground fish
  are a popular ingredient in Japanese cooking.  They
  are added to soups, simmered dishes and noodles and
  are served as hors d'oeuvre.  The name comes from an
  ancient word for the "cattail" reed.  Fish is pureed,
  bound with a starch-usually kuzu, arrowroot or potato
  formed into blocks and steamed.
  
  Sometimes food color-most often pink-red, but
  occasionally green, yellow or brown-is brushed over
  the top to give an attractive slice when cut.
  
  It is sold in vacuum-sealed packs that should be
  refrigerated and used within one week.  To use, slice
  kamaboko and add in final stages of cooking, as it
  needs only to be heated.

           Majonez (Mayonnaise) recipe
           Paprika, sweet
 
    Spread butter/margarine on 1 side of each thin bread
  slice. Sprinkle with chives. Season with salt to
  taste. Cut 1/4 inch of both ends of each egg.
  Carefully slice each egg crosswise into 5 equal
  slices. Place 1 egg slice on each buttered bread
  slice. Spoon mayonnaise into a pastry bag fited with a
  medium fluted nozzle. Pipe mayonnaise onto egg slices.
  Garnish with paprika. Arrange on a platter.
    Variation - Place bite-sized pieces of sliced,
  peeled cucumber, smoked ham or sausage on mayonnaise
  flowers.
  
  DISCLAIMER - The reference mayonnaise recipe uses raw
  egg yolks. Given that salmonella is virtually endemic
  in North American egg and fryer production, it is
  HIGHLY recommended you use a commercially prepared
  mayonnaise of good quality as the egg ingredients have
  been properly pasteurized prior to use.

      Title: KANG CHEUD TANG-RAN SODSAI - STUFFED ZUCCHINI
 Categories: Pork, Poultry, Soups, Oriental
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3    Zucchini, Medium Size.
  1 1/2 c  Lean Ground Pork or Chicken.
      2    Eggs, lightly beaten.
      2 tb Fish Sauce.
           Ground White Peppers.
      2 tb Cilantro, chopped.
      6 c  Chicken or Pork Stock.
 
  Peel zucchini and cut into approximately 1-1/2"
  lengths.  Make the lengths of zucchini into cups by
  scooping out the seeds in the center, but leaving
  small amount to form the bottom of the cup.  You may
  need more or less zucchini than the amount given,
  depending on their size. In a bowl, mix the ground
  pork or chicken with fish sauce, eggs, ground white
  peppers, and cilantro.  Fill the zucchini cups with
  the mixture, and overfill slightly to make a small
  mound.  Cook the filled zucchini cups by steaming for
  about 1/2 hour. Bring the chicken or pork stock to a
  boil, and season to taste.  Place the precooked
  zucchini cups into a serving tureen, pour the boiling
  stock over them, and serve.

      Title: KANGAROO ESCALOPES WITH SPINACH & ANCHOVY B
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    600 g  Kangaroo fillet, trimmed
      2 bn Of English spinach
     12    Anchovy fillets
    200 g  Unsalted butter
      1 ts Lemon juice
      1 ts Black pepper freshly ground
      1 ts Sea salt
           Olive oil
 
  "Most people won't have ever tasted kangaroo. It is a
  sweet, strong-tasting meat, it's texture and taste
  described as somwe- here between venison and
  liver...To eat kangaroo, you have to like game; you
  have to like offal and you have to be a red meat
  eater...It's a very big, very strong-tasting meat."
  
  These recipes are by Chris Manfield from The Paragon
  Cafe, Circular Quay.
  
  Slice the kangaroo fillet into thin slices, three per
  serve. Brush with olive oil and sprinkle lightly with
  black pepper. Remove stalks from spinach and wash
  leaves thoroughly. Plunge into rapidly boiling water
  for 30 seconds. Strain and immerse immediately in iced
  water to stop the cooking process and main- tain the
  green colour. When cold, remove leaves from water and
  squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Refrigerate
  until ready to use.
  
  Soften 100 g unsalted butter and blend in food
  processor with the anchovies, lemon juice and a pinch
  of sea salt and pepper until smooth. Scrape out onto a
  piece of foil and form into a sausage shape.
  Refrigerate until firm Heat a large, heavy- base,
  cast-iron fry pan or grill plate until hot. Toss in
  the oiled meat slices and quickly sear on each side.
  Do not turn until the first side is properly
  sealed--this does not take very long--and don't
  overcook. Remove meat and rest in a warm place until
  all the meat slices are cooked. In another pan, over
  medium heat, melt the remaining butter, add the
  squeezed spinach and the salt and pepper, and stir
  until the spinach is hot. Divide the spinach into four
  portions, spoon onto the centre of the plate, top with
  three escalopes. Slice the anchovy butter so it begins
  to melt over the hot meat. Serve immediately.

 Categories: Noodles, Hungarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lg Head of cabbage
      3 sl Bacon
           Salt and pepper
      1 pk Wide egg noodles
 
  Preparation: Grate cabbage onto a large dish or
  platter. Sprinkle liberally with salt and let stand
  for 1/2 hr. This will help release excess water. While
  cabbage is "resting", fry the bacon to rend the fat.
  Discard bacon or make a B.L.T. Squeeze out water from
  the cabbage and saute in the bacon drippings until
  golden brown. Add salt and pepper to taste. Meanwhile,
  break up the egg noodles so that they're short and fat
  rather than long and fat. Boil according to directions
  on box. When cabbage is done, add the noodles and mix
  thoroughly. This dish is even better the second day.
  Serve as a side dish or, if you make enough of it, a
  main course.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 oz Mushrooms, dried
           -(or use about
           -1/4 lb fresh mushrooms)
    1/2 c  Warm water

    1/3 c  Water
      2 tb Flour
           Salt and pepper
 
  Soak the dried mushrooms in 1/2 cup of warm water for
  1 hour.  Saute mushrooms and onion in butter in a
  skillet 3 minutes. Add sauerkraut to mushrooms; cook
  and stir for 10 minutes.
  
  Blend 1/3 cup water into flour.  Mix with sauerkraut
  and simmer for 15 minutes.  Season to taste with salt
  and pepper.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Stewed Sauerkraut with Mushrooms -- This recipe
  could be used as part of a 12-course meal known in
  Polish as Wigilia, or on its own. Wigilia is eaten
  after sundown on Christmas Eve. This tastes better if
  you make your own sauerkraut (but that's another
  recipe).
  
  *  I usually like to add 1/4 cup of dark rum after
  cooking.  That reminds me of the recipe I have for
  bigos (similar in construction but with more
  ingredients).
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  1 hour.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: KARE IKAN (FISH CURRY)
 Categories: Indonesian, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2    Lb, cleaned weight fish
      6    Shallots or
      1 lg Onion
      2    Cloves garlic
      2 ts Ground coriander
      1 ts Ground ginger
    1/2 ts Powdered lemon grass or
      1    Blade fresh, lemon grass
      1 ts Chilli powder
      1    Salam leaf or bay-leaf
    1/2 ts Turmeric
    1/2 c  Tamarind water
      1 c  Of thick santen (coconut
           -milk)
      2 tb Vegetable oil
           Salt
        sl Cucumber
           Mint
 
  Fish curry is the literal translation of kare Ikan;
  but I should explain that Indonesian 'curry' is rather
  different from Indian curries. The recipe may be used
  for almost any fish.  In the former version of this
  book I suggested salmon steaks, which it suits well;
  but these are now rather expensive.  It is better to
  select a white fish with firm flesh, such as haddock,
  angler-fish, swordfish or dogfish.  In Australia the
  various fish known as whiting would be a good choice.
  Americans might like to use snappers. Whatever fish is
  used, it can be cut into small cubes or slices before
  frying.  Heat a little oil in a heavy frying-pan, and
  carefully brown the fish in it. Meanwhile, in another
  frying-pan, fry the chopped shallots (or onion) and
  garlic until tender. Stir in the chilli, ginger,
  turmeric, coriander, lemon grass, salam, salt and
  tamarind water. Let this mixture simmer for 10
  minutes, then put in the fish. Cover, and simmer for
  another 10 minutes.  Add the santen and cook for a
  further 5 minutes. Serve hot, garnished with very thin
  slices of cucumber and chopped mint. (Alternatively,
  put the cucumber and mint into the kare itself for the
  last 2 minutes of cooking.) Incidentally, the same
  kare can be made with prawns. There is no need to fry
  the prawns separately; but fry them in the mixture of
  onion, etcetera for a few minutes before you put in
  the tamarind water. Makes 4 servings. From "Indonesian
  Food and Cookery", Sri Owen, Prospect Books, London,

      Title: KARHI POORI
 Categories: Breads, Indian
      Yield: 50 Servings
 
      1 c  Flour, whole wheat pastry
      1 c  Flour
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Pepper, black; coarse
  3 1/2 tb Butter, sweet; softened
      1 x  Oil; for frying
 
  Sift the flours and salt into a bowl; add the pepper
  and cut in the butter until the mixture resembles
  coarse oatmeal. Now slowly add very hot water--about a
  half cup plus three tablespoons--and begin to gather
  the flour together. Squeeze the dough into a ball. It
  should just about hold together. Do *not* knead. Break
  the dough into about fifty balls. Keep them covered
  with a lightly dampened tea towel. Heat about 1-1/2 to
  2 inches of oil in a wok over a medium flame. While
  the oil is heating, begin to roll out the pooris. Take
  each dough ball, flatten it, and roll it into a very
  rough round, about two inches in diameter. (Don't
  worry if the edges are ragged or cracked). Roll and
  fry as many pooris as the wok will conveniently hold
  in one layer. Fry two to three minutes a side, until
  the pooris are a very light sandy color on both sides,
  and crisp. Crank the heat up or down as needed. Remove
  the pooris and drain on paper towels or newspaper (or
  both). Allow them to cool and store in an airtight
  container. They won't need refrigeration, and should
  stay fresh for several weeks or until the end of time.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 sm Cucumber; peeled & halved
           -lengthwise (about 4")
    1/8 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Uncooked elbow macaroni
      1    Pickled or matjes herring
           -(2 fillets)
      2    Mushrooms; raw, thin sliced
      2 tb White vinegar
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 ts Salt
    1/8 ts White pepper

MMMMM--------------------------DRESSING-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Mayonnaise
      1 c  Sour cream
  2 1/2 ts Curry powder
 
  Scrape out and discard the seeds from the halved
  cucumber with a teaspoon and slice the halves into
  1/2" cubes. Place these cubes in a small bowl and
  sprinkle with salt to draw out their excess moisture.
  Let the cubes stand 15 minutes, then drain and pat
  them dry with paper towels.
  Cook the macaroni in rapidly boiling salted water for
  20 minutes, following the directions on the package.
  Meanwhile, wash the herring fillets in cold water, pat
  them dry with paper towels and cut them into 1-1/2"
  lengths. Drain the cooked macaroni in a colander, run
  cold water over it to cool it, then spread out on
  paper towels to get rid of any excess moisture.
  Place the cut-up herring in a salad bowl along with
  the cucumber, macaroni and sliced raw mushrooms. In a
  separate bowl, beat together the vinegar, olive oil,
  salt and pepper with a small wire whisk and pour this
  mixture over the ingredients in the salad bowl. With 2
  wooden spoons, mix the salad thoroughly but gently.
  Refrigerate the salad for 1 to 2 hours before serving.
  DRESSING: For a richer dressing, preferred by the
  Danes, whip the mayonnaise,
  sour cream and curry powder together in a small bowl
  and add to the salad just before serving.

 Categories: Vegetables, German
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    200 g  Grated potatoes [that have
           -previously been boiled
           In their jackets, then let
           -cool, and peeled]
           (7 oz)
     30 g  Plain bread crumbs (1 oz)
      1    Egg
     30 g  Butter (2 Tbsp)
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  This refers to dumplings made from boiled potatoes
  which is the traditional Swabian method.  Dumplings
  made from raw potatoes originated in Bavaria and
  reached Swabian kitchens relatively late.
  
  Beat the butter and egg until fluffy.  Add the cold,
  grated, boiled potatoes, bread crumbs, salt, and
  pepper, and knead well. Depending on how watery the
  potatoes are, flour may be substituted for the bread
  crumbs in order to get a dough that is neither too
  firm not to pasty.
  
  Form dumplings, and cook in barely simmering salted
  water for 15 minutes.
  
  Serve immediately, while still piping hot.
  
  These dumplings are also very popular as a main dish,
  with brown gravy.
  
  Serves 4.

      1 ts Water
      1 tb Poppy seeds
 
  Thaw pastry sheets according to package directions.
  Saute onions in oil in a large skillet until lightly

 Categories: Digest, Oct.
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2 c  Water
      2    Vegetable bouillon cube

        x  Garlic granules
        x  Herbs
      1 c  Kasha
      1    Egg substitute
 
  Boil 2 cups of water in a small saucepan.  When it
  boils, add 1 veggie bouillon cube (can't recall the
  brand, it comes 2 cubes in an adorable little box for
  usually 99 cents a box at my HFS).  Add contents of
  one small can of mushroom "stems and pieces" including
  the liquid. Add some herbs to taste -- I threw in
  onion flakes, garlic granules, and can't remember
  which green dried herbs.  Cover the pan so it doesn't
  reduce too much -- you need 2 cups liquid to 1 cup
  kasha. (I didn't add salt because the veggie cube has
  enough.)
  
  While the broth is coming to a boil, put 1 cup of
  kasha (I like the whole grains and also medium-cracked
  grains) in a larger saucepan over medium heat.  Add 1
  egg substitute (I use EnerG).  Stir well over heat
  until the grains get dry again (the same as you
  probably used to do with a real egg). Take the kasha
  pot off heat and hold it away from yourself, and pour
  in the simmering flavored broth (it can really spatter
  if you leave it over heat while adding the hot broth
  to the hot kasha.) Stir once, put over low heat, and
  let it simmer for about 15 minutes.
  
  This makes a LOT, for those of you not familiar with
  kasha.  We had this with a baked butternut (I think)
  squash and small green salads for 3 adults and
  couldn't finish it, which was great as it provided me
  with kasha leftovers to reheat for next day's (still
  delicious) lunch, from just 1 cup of raw kasha.

    1/4 ts Garam masala
 
  Grind  the fennel seeds until find.   Put the yoghurt
  in a bowl and beat it with a fork until smooth and
  creamy. Heat  the oil in a large pot over a high
  flame.   When hot,  put in  the cinnamon and cloves.
    A second later,  put in the ground asafetida.   A
  second after that,  put in all the meat and the salt.
    Stir the meat an cook, still on a high flame for
  about 5 minutes.  Now put in the paprika and  cayenne
  and give the meat a good stir.   Slowly add the
  yoghurt,  a small amount at a time,  stirring the meat
  vigorously as you do so.  Add all  the yoghurt this
  way.   Keep cooking on high heat until all  liquid has
  boiled  away and the meat pieces have browned
  slightly.   Add  the fennel and ginger.   Give the
  meat some more good stirs.  Now put in the water  or
  broth,  cover so as to leave the lid very slightly
  ajar,  and cook  on medium heat for 30 minutes.
    Cover completely and cook on  low heat for another
  45 minutes or until meat is tinder.   Stir a few
  times as  the meat cooks,  making sure that there is
  always some liquid in the pot.
  Remove  the  lid and add the garam masala.   You
  should  have  a  thick, reddish brown sauce.  If it is
  too thin, boil away some of the liquid.

      Title: KATAIFI (SHREDDED NUT PASTRIES)
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
      Yield: 40 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
    500 g  Kataifi pastry
      1 c  Butter; melted

MMMMM------------------------NUT FILLING-----------------------------
      1 c  Coarsely ground walnuts
      1 c  Coarsely ground almonds
    1/2 c  Caster sugar
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
      1    Egg white; lightly beaten
      1 tb Brandy

MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------
      2 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 c  Water
      1 ts Lemon juice
      1    Thin strip of lemon rind
      4    Cloves
      1    Piece cinnamon bark
      1 tb Honey
 
  Makes: 40 pieces Oven temperature: 180 C (350 F)
  Cooking time: 50-55 minutes
  
  Take an eighth of the pastry strands and spread out on
  a board to a 18 x 25 cm (7 x 10 inch) rectangle with
  strands running roughly lengthwise. Using a pastry
  brush, dab some butter over strands.  Combine nut
  filling ingredients and spread about 2 tablespoons of
  filling along one narrow edge.  Roll up firmly into a
  neat roll.  Repeat with remaining ingredients. Place
  rolls close together in a 20 x 30 cm (8 x 12 inch)
  slab cake pan or baking dish.  Brush top with
  remaining butter.  Bake in a moderate oven, one shelf
  above centre, for 50-55 minutes until golden brown.
  
  Meanwhile, dissolve sugar in water over heat, add
  lemon juice and rind, cloves and cinnamon.  Bring to
  the boil and boil over medium heat for 10 minutes.
  Stir in honey, strain and cool.  Pour cooled syrup
  over hot pastries and place a folded cloth on top.
  Leave until cool.  Cut each roll into 5 pieces
  diagonally if preferred.
  
  ALTERNATIVE SHAPING:  Take a small handful of pastry
  strands and spread out fairly compactly on board.
  Have strands running towards you as much as possible
  and dab with butter.  Mould a tablespoon of nut
  filling into a short sausage shape and place on one
  end.  Roll up firmly into a neat roll and place in
  baking dish.  Repeat with remaining ingredients.
  Makes about 30 rolls each about 5 cm (2 inches) long.
  Bake as directed above, prepare syrup and finish as in
  previous recipe.

 Categories: Greek, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias

MMMMM----------------------CUSTARD FILLING---------------------------
      4 c  Milk
    3/4 c  Cornflour
      4    Eggs; beaten
      1 pn Salt
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla essence

MMMMM-----------------------KATAIFI CRUST----------------------------
    500 g  Kataifi (shredded pastry)
    3/4 c  Unsalted butter; melted

MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------
      2 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 c  Water
      1    Thin strip lemon rind
      1    Piece of cinnamon bark
      3 ts Lemon juice
 
  Oven temperature: 190 C (375 F) Cooking time: 1 hour
  
  Combine milk and cornflour in a heavy pan.  Blend in
  beaten eggs and add salt and sugar.  Place over medium
  heat and stir constantly until thickened and bubbling.
  Remove from heat, stir in vanilla essence and cover
  top of custard with buttered paper to prevent a skin
  forming.
  
  Place kataifi in a large bowl and gently separate
  strands with fingers. Grease a 20 x 28 cm (8 x 11
  inch) oven dish with some of the butter.  Put half the
  kataifi in the base, pressing it down to make it
  compact. Drizzle 1/4 cup butterr evenly over it.  Pour
  custard filling over kataifi, spreading it evenly.
  Top with remaining kataifi.  Spread evenly and pat
  down gently.  Pour remaining melted butter evenly over
  top.  Bake in a moderately hot oven for 45 minutes
  until golden brown.  Remove from oven and leave until
  cool.
  
  Dissolve sugar in water over medium heat, add lemon
  rind and cinnamon bark and bring to the boil.  Add
  lemon juice and boil over medium heat for 15 minutes,
  skimming when necessary.  Do not stir once syrup is
  boiling. Strain hot syrup over cooled pastry.  Leave
  until cold and cut into diamond shapes to serve.
  
  Note: The previous recipe is the traditional way in
  which this dessert is made.  As the custard and syrup
  soften the kataifi, many good cooks use the following
  method for a crisp finish:
  
  Prepare the syrup as directed above and leave until
  cool.  Place the kataifi in a bowl and loosen stands.
  Pour on 1/2 cup melted, unsalted butter and mix with
  fingers to coat strands.  Spread kataifi in two
  buttered 20 x 28 cm (8 x 11 inch) straight-sided oven
  dishes and press down to make it compact.  Bake in a
  moderately hot oven for 20-25 minutes until golden -
  take care that it does not become too brown.  Remove
  from the oven and pour cooled syrup evenly over hot
  kataifi in each dish. Cover each dish with a tea towel
  so that kataifi softens slightly, otherwise it will be
  difficult to cut.  Make custard as directed in
  previous recipe and pour while hot onto kataifi in one
  dish.  Invert other dish of kataifi on top of the
  custard.  Leave uncovered until cool, then cut into
  diamond shapes to serve.

 Categories: Puddings
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      6 c  Bramble fruit (see note)
      1 lb Whole wheat bread
           Raw sugar
           Heavy cream
 
  In a two-quart pudding mold, crush but don't sieve the
  fruit.  Sweeten to taste with raw sugar (not brown
  sugar).
  
  Tear into small pieces enough homemade whole-wheat
  bread, crust and all, to pack the mold till it's full.
  Refrigerate the pudding for something between 6 and 24
  hours.
  
  Don't even dream of unmolding it, just spoon it out
  and serve it with heavy unsweetened cream.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Uncooked fruit and bread pudding -- Here is my
  friend Kate Ashcroft's Yorkshire version of the
  dessert known as "summer pudding".
  
  *  For "bramble fruit" use some berry that grows on a
  brambly vine. Raspberries, blackberries, presumably
  huckleberries and ollalie berries. Some currants are
  OK, some gooseberries are OK, even some blueberries
  are OK, but no strawberries, they don't fit the mood.
  
  *  Day-old bread is better than dead fresh for this
  recipe, but not older than a day.
  
  *  For contrast, here is the standard version:  In a
  two-quart pudding mold, truck out one pint of
  Woolworth's raspberry jam with enough Golden Syrup to
  make a quart and a half of goo. Tear into small pieces
  enough stale crumb, not crust, of bakery white bread
  to pack the mold till it's full. Refrigerate the
  pudding for six weeks. Serve with Bird's Custard Sauce.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 6 hours cooling.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: KATHY PITTS ON HOMINY
 Categories: Info, Grains
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  The Mexicans make a wonderful pork stew called Pozole
  that contains hominy, pork, chunks of chiles, onions,
  etc, topped with fresh chopped veggies, lime juice.
  Don't have a recipe handy, though....
  
  My mother used to make a pretty good hominy dish by
  draining the corn, and making a cheese sauce (whatever
  you make for macaroni and cheese will do nicely).  She
  would then combine the hominy and cheese, top with
  some pieces of cooked bacon or leftover ham, and baked
  the whole thing until it was browned.  I loved it as a
  kid. Made it for Wes one time, and discovered he hates
  hominy as much as he hates grits, so haven't had it in
  a while.
  
  I've also had an elaborate succotash that contained
  (in about equal proportions), hominy, fresh corn cut
  off the cob, fresh lima beans and cooked white (navy)
  beans.  Very nice stuff.
  
  One of my aunts (a Southerner from Mississippi) used
  to fry it in bacon drippings until it was brown and
  serve it as a side dish. Don't recall being all that
  thrilled with THAT presentation, though.

      1 sm Goat kid
           Orange juice
           Beer
           Lemon pepper
 
  I've barbecued it succesfully, using a wet marinade of
  half orange juice and half beer (marinate at LEAST
  overnight, longer would be better.) Rub the meat well
  with lemon pepper, pop on a covered barbecue pit with
  VERY low heat, and hot smoke until tender, basting
  occasionally with the orange juice/beer mixture.  This
  is going to take a LONG time, something close to 12-18
  hours.
  
  The folks who ate the goat said it was delicious.
  Personally, I haven't a clue, because I was so tired
  of smelling the darn thing, I didn't eat any.

 Categories: Mexican, Breakfast
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 md Potato, boiled and cut
           -into chunks or grated
      4 sl Bacon
      4    Eggs, lightly beaten
      4    Flour tortilla
 
  Place bacon in a cold pan, and cook until almost
  crisp.  All the fat should be rendered.  Remove bacon
  from pan, and drain.
  
  Place potato chunks in the pan, and cook, turning
  occasionally, until well browned and crisp.  Cut bacon
  into 1 inch pieces, and add to potatoes. Immediately
  pour eggs over the potato/bacon mixture, and cook,
  stirring frequently, until soft-scrambled.
  
  Spoon mixture into heated flour tortillas, and roll or
  fold.
  
  Serve with pico de gallo, hot sauce, chopped cilantro,
  jalapeno peppers to be added as desired.
  
  In actuality, the filling can be darn near anything
  you have handy (eggs optional).  Leftover fajitas are
  great, as is Mexican-style chorizo (which makes the
  greasiest breakfast tacos known to man, if you don't
  drain the cooked chorizo mixture VERY well before
  adding the eggs). Cheese may be added to the mixture,
  or sprinkled on the cooked ingredients before rolling.

      3 lb Brisket, trimmed of
           -almost all fat and
           -silvery covering
      3 tb Liquid smoke marinade
           (we used Figaro's)
      3 tb Worcestershire sauce
      1    Serrano pepper, seeded
           And cut into fine slivers
      3    The white part of 2-3
           -green onions, cut into
           -fine slivers
           Lots of paprika, lemon
           Pepper for a barbecue rub
 
  Marinate the brisket in a mixture of the liquid smoke
  and Worcestershire sauce for 2-3 hours.  Remove from
  the marinade, and cut slits all over the exterior of
  the meat.  Insert slivers of onion and serrano pepper
  in the slits.
  
  Cover the brisket with a VERY liberal coating of
  paprika and lemon pepper. Wrap securely in heavy duty
  aluminum foil (use a drug-store wrap to prevent
  leakage).
  
  Place the brisket in an ovenproof rimmed dish (we used
  our trusty cast iron skillet) and place in a preheated
  250 degree (F) oven for at least 16 hours.
  
  After the first 12-14 hours, you may unwrap the
  brisket briefly, and ladle out some of the accumulated
  juices for use in your own homemade barbecue sauce.

      Title: KATHY PITTS' EGGPLANT
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
 
  Try slicing the eggplant in half inch slices, then
  covering each slice with a generous amount of salt,
  and placing it in a sieve. Place a heavy weight (one
  of your cast iron skillets would be about right) on
  top, and let it sit and drip for about an hour.
  (Longer would be even better). This removes the
  astringent tasting juices that many people don't care
  for.
  
  Rinse the eggplant very well to remove the salt.
  Bread the slices by dipping them in flour, egg, then
  flour or breadcrumbs.  Fry in hot olive oil until
  brown.  (You'll be amazed at the amount of oil this
  requires -- eggplant absorbs the stuff like a sponge.)
  
  Now layer the eggplant in a casserole, and cover with
  a good garlicy homemade tomato sauce, and a generous
  handful of grated mozarella and Parmesan cheese.
  Place in a 350 oven, and bake until the cheese is
  melted and slightly browned.
  
  Even Wes, who thinks he hates eggplant, will eat it
  this way.
  
  He also likes it brushed with a little olive oil
  (herb-flavored oil is better, basil-flavored oil is
  best), and grilled, IF I give it the salt treatment
  first.

      Title: KATHY PITTS' ENCHILADA SAUCE
 Categories: Mexican, Sauces
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  Making your own isn't all that difficult.  Time
  consuming and sinus clearing, but not difficult.
  
  Don't have a recipe (when you're around here long
  enough, you'll know that I almost NEVER have a
  recipe), but I can tell you how to make it.
  
  Start with about 6 dried ancho chiles, 6 dried pasilla
  chiles.
  
  Place the chiles on a flat baking sheet and roast in a
  preheated 350 degree oven until the chiles become
  fragrant (about 15 minutes).  Do not allow them to
  scorch.  NOTE:  You might want to open all the windows
  while doing this, the fumes will definately clear your
  sinuses.
  
  Remove the chiles from the oven and cool slightly.
  Slit open and remove the stems, seeds and veins.
  Place the remainder in a bowl, and cover with boiling
  water.  Allow to sit for about 30 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, heat a can of chicken broth, to which you
  have added a small minced onion, 1-2 cloves of minced
  garlic, and a generous pinch of Mexican oregano and
  cumin.
  
  Simmer until the onion and garlic is very soft.
  
  Meanwhile, remove the chiles from the liquid, and
  force through a fine sieve.  Do not yield to
  temptation and whirl this mixture through a blender.
  The chile peels tend to be bitter, and will transfer
  this bitterness to the sauce.  Discard the peels, and
  any remaining seeds, but be sure to force all the
  chile pulp through the sieve.  Scrape the chile puree
  (called a caribe) into the chicken broth mixture.
  
  Pour this mixture into a blender or food processor and
  process until smooth.  Return to the pan, and simmer,
  adjusting seasonings (it may need more cumin, will
  need salt) to taste.  If the mixture isn't hot enough
  for your taste, add pure ground chile peppers and/or
  hot sauce to taste.
  
  Continue simmering over low heat (careful, it scorches
  like crazy), stirring frequently, until the mixture is
  thick enough to coat a spoon.
  
  For a quickie version of this, you can always opt for
  the classic Tex- Mex Chili Gravy.  Melt 2 tbsp. of
  lard in a frying pan, and add 2 tbsp. of flour, and as
  much chili powder (the stuff that contains ground
  chiles, cumin, oregano, sometimes salt, and
  God-knows-what-else) as your conscience allows (1/4
  cup is a good starting point.) Cook the
  flour/fat/chile mixture until a thick paste forms. Do
  not allow it to brown. Now wisk in enough chicken
  broth to make a medium-thick sauce.
  
  Personally, I think this results in an enchilada sauce
  that tastes remarkably like the enchiladas in frozen
  TV dinners, but some folks like it.

  This Tex-Mex favorite was around LONG before the
  yuppiefood industry snagged it, and turned it into a
  cliche. This is our version of the dish, which is (I
  think) pretty close to the original. Our marinade for
  this changes from time to time, depending on the mood
  of the cook, the contents of the pantry, and perhaps
  the phases of the moon, so feel free to fuss with it.
  
  Skirt steak is the diaphragm of the beef, a long very
  stringy cut of meat that accounts for the name of the
  dish (trans. "sashes"). It used to be dirt cheap, and
  was poor folks fare until the food faddists discovered
  it.
  
  (Depending on where you live, this cut may either be
  easily found at your market, or require a special
  order with the butcher.  In a pinch, you could
  substitute flank steak, just don't tell me about it
  :-) ) To be tender, the meat demands VERY careful
  handling.  Arm yourself with a small, sharp knife, and
  obsessively trim off ALL the fat, and as much of the
  silvery membrane surrounding the exterior of the meat
  as you can manage. This can take a while, but be
  persistant. The more you trim, the better the finished
  product.
  
  Place the meat in a deep non-metallic pan, and cover
  with a mixture of the remaining ingredients.  Marinate
  the meat, turning occasionally for at least 2 hours
  (overnight is better). When the exterior of the meat
  is grey, it's ready to cook.
  
  The soy is NOT authentic, but since Ninfa's, the
  Tex-Mex restaurant chain that originally popularized
  the dish uses it in THEIR marinade, I sometimes do,
  too. It gives the finished dish a nice shiny glaze.
  
  To cook, fish the meat out of the marinade, and dry
  well.  Season the exterior with a liberal quantity of
  cracked black pepper (lemon pepper is good, too), and
  garlic powder (not salt).
  
  Grill over a medium-hot charcoal fire (best), or broil
  or grill indoors. Either way, be VERY careful not to
  overcook the meat.  If you cook skirt steak beyond
  medium rare, it will be the toughest cut of meat
  imaginable. Since the steak itself is quite thin,
  cooking time will be brief. To serve, cut into thin,
  slanting slices, carving against the grain of the meat.
  
  The Accompaniments
  
  Fajitas are generally accompanied by sauteed or
  grilled onions and sweet green peppers (you can saute
  the onions and peppers well in advance, and re-heat on
  the grill if you are doing the dish outdoors).
  
  Also served is Pico de Gallo, a fresh tomato based
  salsa.
  
  You will also need a stack of the best flour tortillas
  you can find. Some refried beans on the side would be
  nice, too.
  
  Other possible accompaniments include guacamole or
  sliced avocados, lime wedges to squeeze over
  everything, shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream.
  
  To eat, take a few slices of meat, and lay on a
  tortilla.  Top with the sauteed onions and peppers,
  pico de gallo, and whatever else suits you.
  
  Fold into a soft taco, and enjoy.

 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
 
  First, cut the squash (we use zucchini, but yellow
  crookneck should work, too) in coin-like slices about
      1/4    inch thick.
  
  Place the squash in a deep pan, and pour evaporated
  milk over it.
  
  Swish the squash around a bit until all pieces are
  well coated with milk.
  
  Now, place a thin layer of breading (any commercial
  breading mix will work, or your favorite breading mix
  containing flour, seasonings, and cornmeal will do
  well) in a fairly deep, rimmed pan.
  
  Carefully lay one layer of squash slices on the
  breading.  Cover with another thin layer of breading,
  layer on more squash, more breading, etc., until all
  squash is used.
  
  Cover this mess, and refrigerate for AT LEAST 15
  minutes (30 minutes is better).  Remove the squash
  from the breading mixture, being careful not to
  disturb the crumb coating.
  
  Drop into hot deep fat, and fry until well browned.
  
  Drain, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve with
  either Marinara sauce (bottled Ragu or something
  similar is fine) or Ranch dressing as a dip.

      Title: KATHY PITTS' FRIJOLES REFRITOS (REFRIED BEANS
 Categories: Mexican, Beans
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      2 c  Beans, well washed and
           -picked over
      1 lg Onion, finely chopped
      1 sm Dried red chile pepper
           -crushed
      6 c  Water or ham broth. Up to
           -1 cup may be beer
      1 ts Ground cumin
      1 tb Mexican oregano
           Lard/drippings for frying
           Grated mild cheddar
           Cheese for garnish (optl)
 
  Do not soak the beans overnight (Mexican cooks don't).
  Instead, place all ingredients in a deep pot, and
  bring to a boil.  Turn off the heat, cover, and allow
  the beans to sit for an hour.
  
  Return the beans to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer
  until the beans are tender (to test, remove one bean
  from the pot, and blow on it. If the skin splits,
  they're done).  Cooking time will depend on the type
  of bean used (pintos cook fairly quickly, black beans
  take close to forever), the age of the bean, and the
  mineral content of your water.
  
  Salt to taste.  Never salt beans at the beginning of
  the cooking process, as the salt will toughen them and
  they will take longer to cook.
  
  In a large shallow pan, preferably a black iron frying
  pan, melt 3 Tbsp. of lard or drippings.  When the lard
  is melted, ladle about a cup of beans, including some
  of the cooking liquid, into the fat. Use a potato
  masher to mash the beans into a puree.  Continue
  adding beans and liquid, along with more fat as
  needed, and mashing until all beans have been used.
  
  The consistancy of this dish varies with personal
  preferance.  Some cooks like a very smooth, almost
  liquid puree, while other prefer a stiffer mixture
  with some pieces of bean remaining.  The end result
  should be glossy, well flavored from the fat, and very
  rich tasting.
  
  The beans may be served plain, used as a filling for
  warm tortillas, or garnished with shredded cheese.
  
  A bean and cheese taco (refried beans, shredded cheese
  in a fresh tortilla) is one of my favorite things to
  have for breakfast.  They are also good served as an
  accompaniment for scrambled eggs.
  
  NOTE:  Some Mexican recipes for beans call for a sprig
  of Epasote (ep- puh-ZOH-tay) to be cooked with the
  beans.  This is an herb/weed known as Pigweed in the
  U.S.  It doesn't dry well, but it is very easy to grow
  (U.S. farmers consider it a pest).  If you can get
  ahold of a plant, it's worth cultivating, as it adds a
  nice, if undefinable flavor to the bean pot. It is not
  common in Tex-Mex beans, however, so if you encounter
  it in a recipe, feel free to omit it.

      Title: KATHY PITTS' GUACAMOLE
 Categories: Appetizers, Dips, Relishes, Sauces, Mexican
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      2    Ripe avocados
      2    Green onions, minced
      1 sm Tomato (preferably Roma),
           -seeded and minced
           Juice of 1 lime
      1    Jalapeno or serrano
           -pepper, seeded & minced
           Salt to taste
 
  This next recipe is for the closest thing you will
  find to a green salad in classic Mexican cooking.
  Although many fresh vegetables are used in both
  Mexican and Tex-Mex dishes, they usually are
  incorporated in the dish, rather than served
  separately.
  
  Guacamole (Wahk-uh-MOLE-ay) is an avocado-based
  relish/sauce/salad that may be used as a garnish,
  accompaniment or first course (often in this role,
  accompanied by crisp-fried tortilla wedges for
  dipping).
  
  For a really elegant (and typically Mexican)
  presentation, serve the Guacamole in individual
  lettuce cups, garnished with a radish rose.
  
  Peel and seed the avocados.  Place one avocado in a
  bowl and mash until smooth.  Coarsely chop the second
  avocado and stir it in, along with the remaining
  ingredients.  Serve immediately if possible.
  
  NOTE:  Some cooks prefer to puree all the avocado.
  For my taste, this makes the dish seem uncomfortably
  like baby food, but if you prefer it smooth, go for it.
  
  If this sauce is to be held for any length of time at
  all, return the avocado pits to the mixture (this
  helps prevent discoloration), and cover with plastic
  wrap, placed directly on the mixture, pressing down to
  eliminate all air.  Avocados discolor to a nasty brown
  if left exposed to the air.

      Title: KATHY PITTS' KINDA RATATOUILLE (I IMPROVISE A
 Categories: Vegetables, Stews
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 sm Eggplant, unpeeled, and
           -cut into 1-inch chunks)
      1 lg Onion, sliced
      1    Green bell pepper, sliced
      1    Red bell pepper, sliced
      1    Yellow bell pepper,sliced
      3    Tomatoes, 1" chunks
      2    Zucchini or other summer
           -squash, cut in 1" chunks
      3 cl Garlic, minced
           Olive oil
           Chopped fresh herbs
           (basil, oregano, parsley)
           Salt, pepper to taste
 
  Use a big deep fryin pan for this (your chicken fryer
  would be about right).  It's the kind of dish that
  tends to "grow" alarmingly as you toss things in.
  
  Film the bottom of the pan with olive oil, and heat
  until hot but not smoking.  Add the onion and garlic,
  and saute until wilted.  Add the tomatoes and
  eggplant, and cook until they begin to release some of
  their juices.  Now toss in everything else, cover the
  pan, and cook over low heat, stirring frequently,
  until the remaining vegetables are tender. Season to
  taste with herbs, salt, pepper, and remove from the
  heat.
  
  May be served hot, at room temperature (best, IMHO),
  or slightly chilled.
  
  I can make a meal of this with some good French or
  Italian bread and butter, but it's also a nice side
  dish with grilled poultry.

      Title: KATHY PITTS' NEW MEXICO CHILI
 Categories: Chili, Pork
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
 
  I don't have a real recipe for New Mexico-style chile,
  although I do make it occasionally when I manage to
  drag home more fresh Anaheim or Poblano chiles than I
  can dispose of otherwise.  (Kroger's sometimes has BIG
  bags of them for 99 cents a bag ;-)
  
  What I do is first roast the chiles (either in the
  broiler or -- better -- over charcoal).  The number of
  chiles I use depends on the size/heat of the chiles,
  and can range from 2-3 to 10 or more.  If the chiles
  are really hot (it happens sometimes, even with
  Anaheims), I'll also add 3-4 roasted green bell
  peppers to give the dish the required pepper taste
  without rendering it inedible by anyone without an
  asbestos esophagus.
  
  After the chiles have cooled a bit, I peel and seed
  them, and cut them into coarse dice.  I sometimes (not
  always) will also roast/peel 5-6 tomatoes to place in
  the chiles, but tomatoes are optional in this dish,
  and I usually don't use 'em.
  
  Next, cut up 3-4 pounds of lean boneless pork (beef is
  sometimes used, but isn't as good in this dish, IMHO,
  and I would imagine lamb would be very good here
  indeed).
  
  Coat the meat in seasoned flour, and brown it in hot
  lard.  Remove from the pan and set aside.  Toss a
  couple of chopped onions into the pot, along with a
  clove or two of garlic.  When the onions are golden, I
  add enough flour to make a roux, and cook until the
  roux is light brown.
  
  I then add chicken broth to make a fairly thin gravy,
  the pork, chiles, tomatoes (if used), and season the
  dish with cumin and Mexican oregano.
  
  Simmer for a couple of hours, until the pork is tender
  and the flavors have blended.  The end dish should
  have a pronounced green chile/pepper flavor and be the
  consistancy of a thick stew.  It's very good by
  itself, or as a filling for burritos/soft tacos, and
  is wonderful reheated the next morning and served as a
  side dish with scrambled eggs for breakfast. Wes, for
  some bizarre reason, likes it over rice...
  
  Sorry for the inexact recipe/directions.  I learned to
  make this dish from an ex-neighbor who was or mixed
  Hispanic/Native American ancestry, and never QUITE got
  around to rendering her directions into a real recipe.
  (She served the dish with fry bread, and a pot of
  white beans on the side -- have no idea whether this
  was traditional or simply the way she liked it.)

      Title: KATHY PITTS' ONION RINGS
 Categories: Snacks, Vegetables, Appetizers, Side dish
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
 
  Slice large onions into thick slices (about 1/2 inch
  thick)  Separate the slices into rings.
  
  Purchase a package of Oriental-style Tempura Mix at
  the grocery store (this is sold under the Ka-Me and
  various other brand names).
  
  Make the mix according to package directions, except
  substitute cold beer for the liquid called for in the
  directions.
  
  Dip the onion rings in the batter, and deep fry until
  light golden (it won't and shouldn't get too brown).
  The result is a wonderful, crispy onion ring with a
  very light batter coating that even people who usually
  don't like onion rings seem to enjoy.
  
  This batter is also good for fish, shrimp, fried
  mushrooms, fried zucchini, etc.

      Title: KATHY PITTS' POT ROAST
 Categories: Beef, Info
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  Don't really have a recipe, David, but would you
  settle for directions on how to make one?
  
  First select a good-sized hunk of not too tender beef
  roast.  A 3-5 lb. hunk of chuck, bottom round or
  brisket would be good.  Look for a fairly lean piece
  that has at least some fat marbling inside and a light
  fat coating on the outside.
  
  Select a covered casserole or Dutch oven large enough
  to hold the roast with a bit of room left over.  Place
  the cooking pot on the stove, and add enough oil or
  fat (rendered bacon fat is good, if not heart healthy)
  to the pot to cover the bottom to the depth of about
  1/4 inch. Heat the fat over medium-high heat until it
  is hot, but not smoking.
  
  Meanwhile, either dry the outside of the roast very
  well with paper towels or roll it in flour seasoned
  lightly with pepper, maybe some garlic salt, whatever
  other herbs seem appropriate.
  
  When the fat is hot, add the roast, and brown well on
  all sides. Take your time with this.  You want a nice,
  crusty coating, but you don't want to burn it.  Remove
  the browned roast from the pan, and set aside.
  
  Add about one cup of chopped onion, 1/2 cup of chopped
  celery and 1/2 cup of diced carrots to the fat
  remaining in the pan.  Cook, stirring frequently,
  until this mixture is nice and brown.  Drain off most
  of the remaining fat, leaving the vegetables in the
  pot.
  
  Smooth the vegetables out to make a base for the
  roast, and add the roast to the pot.  Now add enough
  liquid (beef stock, 3/4 beef stock plus 1/4 dry red
  wine, tomato juice, whatever you feel like) to come
  about 1/4 inch over the bottom of the beef.  The
  amount of liquid you need (don't use too much or the
  beef will boil instead of braising) will depend on the
  size of the pot and the size/shape of the roast.
  
  Cover the pot, and either simmer on top of the stove
  over very low heat, or place it in a preheated 325
  degree oven.  Either way, check the roast every half
  hour or so, turning the meat occasionally, and adding
  more liquid as needed.
  
  After an hour or so, you can add small whole peeled
  carrots, peeled potato halves or whatever other
  vegetables appeal to you to the roast. If you do this,
  tuck the vegetables around the side of the roast so
  they sit in the liquid.
  
  Cooking time will depend on the cut of beef, and the
  tenderness of the meat, but you can count on at least
  2-2 1/2 hours.  The meat is done when a large cooking
  fork can be inserted easily.
  
  At this point, remove the meat and vegetables (if
  used) to a serving platter and keep warm.
  
  Pour the liquid remaining in the pan through a
  strainer, into a bowl, pressing down on the strainer
  to extract as much of the juices from the chopped
  vegetables as possible.
  
  Skim the fat from the surface of the juices, and
  return about 4 tbsp. of fat to the cooking pot (do not
  wash the pot first, any goodies remaining in the
  bottom will add to the flavor of the gravy.)
  
  Add an equal amount of flour to the fat in the pot,
  and cook, stirring constantly, until the flour/fat
  mixture has turned a nice brown color (about the color
  of peanut butter.)  Slowly wisk the reserved cooking
  juices back into the flour/fat mixture, adding
  additional liquid as needed to make a smooth, not too
  thick gravy.  Season the gravy to taste with salt and
  black pepper.
  
  Slice the pot roast into fairly thin, even slices, and
  cover with a small amount of gravy.  Serve garnished
  with the vegetables (if used), and the additional
  gravy on the side.

      Title: KATHY PITTS' SANDIA LIQUADO
 Categories: Mexican, Fruits, Beverages
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  When we were living in Mexico, I got virtually
  addicted to the liquados (freshly-made fruit juices)
  they served.  My favorite was Sandia (watermelon).
  They made it by placing whole chunks of watermelon
  (without the seeds) in a blender, and whirling it
  until pulverized, then adding a squeeze of lime juice,
  and some water (usually lightly carbonated mineral
  water).  No salt or sugar (I watched ;-), but it was
  the best, most refreshing drink imaginable. I remember
  one night, we sat in a little restaurant in the plaza
  of some little town, and (to the everlasting amazement
  of our waiter), I drank FIVE beer-scooner-sized
  glasses of the stuff.
  
  I've always thought this would also be good as an ice
  (either made in one of those little crank-style
  freezers you can keep in the refrigerator, or poured
  into a freezer tray and stirred occasionally. Never
  quite got around to trying to do that one, though.
  Maybe this summer.

 Categories: Pizza
      Yield: 1 Pizza
 
 
  Make your favorite pizza dough.  While dough is
  resting, slice and saute VERY slowly in olive oil a
  large quantity of thinly sliced white onions. (How
  many onions? Let your conscience be your guide -- you
  can't have too many onions, in my opinion.) Cook the
  onions, stirring occasionally, until they are golden,
  and almost reduced to a pulp. Set aside to cool, while
  you roll out the dough.
  
  Form the pizza, and let rise for a half hour of so.
  Using your fingers, make dents in the dough. Now
  drizzle the dough with olive oil. Sprinkle all over
  with rosemary (fresh if possible), and layer the
  cooled onions over the dough.
  
  Now, cover the onions with a good-sized layer of
  freshly grated Parmesan or Romano cheese. Bake as
  usual.
  
  This makes a wonderful snack with drinks, or we like
  it as a meal with a good salad of mixed greens.

      2 tb Butter or margarine
      2 tb Flour
      1 c  Milk*

  *(for a more authentic military flavor, use canned

  Remove the beef from the package, and tear into
  shreds. Melt the butter, and briefly saute the beef in
  the butter (it should just become slightly crispy).
  Add the flour, and stir until the whole mess congeals
  slightly and begins to look a little like wet beach
  sand (DO NOT brown the flour).
  
  Stir in the milk, and whisk until smooth.  Season to
  taste with salt, pepper, and dry mustard.  Simmer
  briefly until thickened and all the floury taste is
  removed.
  
  Serve over mashed potatoes, rice, biscuits or toast.
  
  NOTE:  For a better, but distinctly non-military

  handfuls of grated cheddar cheese, and a few grains of
  cayenne pepper.

 Categories: Eggs, Fish, Salads, Sandwiches
      Yield: 1 Text file
 
 
  I've frequently made an egg and tuna salad without
  mayo (NEVER made it with Miracle Whip, as I can't
  stand the stuff).
  
  Here's a rough guideline to go by (I tend to make tuna
  salad with whatever's on hand, so it varies a LOT):
  
  Drain a can of water-packed tuna, and dump into a
  bowl.  Add a couple of hardboiled eggs, chopped, maybe
  a half of a chopped green Bell pepper, half a chopped
  red Bell pepper, a couple of green onions, finely
  minced, a rib of celery, including a generous portion
  of leaves, finely minced, sometimes a few chopped
  green or black olives. Moisten the mixture with either
  a good oil and vinegar dressing, or a few tablespoons
  of your favorite fat-free Italian dressing.
  
  This makes a good filling for pita bread.
  
  If you like, you can turn this into a dinner salad by
  adding cooked pasta (rotini, elbow macaroni, whatever
  suits your fancy).  I've also tossed in chopped
  artichoke hearts on occasion (in which case, the
  marinade from the artichokes, plus a little vinegar
  becomes the dressing.
  
  If I want a really SERIOUS salad, I'll also toss in
  some thawed but uncooked frozen mixed vegetables (the
  Italian-type mixes are particularly good). Garnish
  with sliced cucumber, maybe some radish roses or
  whatever.

      Title: KAY'S FAVORITE MEAT LOAF
 Categories: Diabetic, Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Beef bouillion;
    1/2 c  Boiling water
      2 sl Bread; crumbled fine
  1 1/2 lb 85% lean ground beef;
      2 md Eggs; beaten slightly
    1/2 c  Onion; chopped finely
    1/4 c  Celery; chopped finely
      2 ts Worcestershire sauce;
      1 tb Catup
 
  Preheat oven to 350 f degree.  Line a shallow 8-inch
  baking pan with foil. Dissolve beef bouillion cube in
  boiling water in a large bowl. Add all other
  ingrediets except the catsup and blend well with a
  fork. Turn onto foil in pan and, with hands, shape
  quickly into a 6 by 4 1/2 inch by 2 inch loaf.  With
  the dull edge of a knife make a crisscross pattern
  across the top, spread with catup across the top.
  Cover loaf with a tent of foil that does not touch the
  top. Bake 45 minutes. Remove foil; bake, uncovered,
  another 45 minutes.  Remove from oven and cool in pan
  for 2-3 minutes before serving.  Using this molded
  metheod instead of loaf pan allows the fat to drain
  from the loaf, whereas a loaf pan retains fat.

      Title: KAZ'S VEGETABLE CASSEROLE
 Categories: Vegetarian, Vegetables, Beans
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      4    Mushrooms
      2    Onions
      5    Mange tout
    220 g  Chick peas
    400 g  Tomatoes with chili spices
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
      1 tb Natural or hazelnut yoghurt
      1 tb White wine vinegar
      2 ts Brown mustard seeds
 
  White grape juice is just as good as white wine if you
  want to avoid the alcohol. The recipe works well
  without either. Preparation: chop the onions into 2cm
  pieces and finely dice the mushrooms.
  Add all the vegetables to a casserole dish, then add
  the spices, chickpeas, yoghurt and white wine. If
  possible leave to marinate for a couple of hours to
  let the vegetables absorb the taste. Microwave on high
  (650w oven) for 15 minutes, or longer if you want the
  vegetables to be soft rather than crunchy - say 20
  minutes. Serve with Biryani rice - I use brown rice
  with lentils, almonds, sultanas and a mixture of
  vegetables such as carrots and broccoli.

      Title: KAZAKH LAMB DUMPLINGS
 Categories: Ethnic, Lamb, Main dish, Chinese
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    3/4 lb Lamb finely ground
      2 tb Salt
      1 ea Egg
      1 qt Peanut oil
      3 tb Butter
    1/4 c  Parsley chopped fine
      2 tb Cilantro chopped fine
      1 ea Garlic clove minced
      3 tb Cold boiled rice
           - Dough -
      1 ts Salt
      3 ea Eggs
      1 c  Cold water
      4 c  Flour all-purpose
 
  DOUGH: Combine flour & salt in a large mixing bowl.
  Make a deep well in the center. Drop in the eggs &
  water. With your hands mix the flour into the liquid
  until thoroughly mixed. Dough should be able to be
  gathered into a compact ball. Transfer dough-ball to a
  lightly floured surface & pressed flat. Knead the
  dough by folding from end-to-end then flattening it
  with the heel of your hand. Be sure to sprinkle the
  dough with extra flour as needed. Knead for approx. 15
  minutes or until dough becomes smooth and very elastic
  in texture. Shape into a ball, wrap loosely in either
  waxed paper or place in a bowl covered with a towel.
  Alow to stand at room temperature for a minimum of 1
  hour but no more than 4 hours. FILLING: Melt the
  butter in a large skillet then add 1 T of the peanut
  oil and mix well over High heat. Add the ground lamb &
  the garlic. Brown well being sure to break up any
  clumps of meat that may form. Transfer lamb to a
  mixing bowl. Add the parsley, cilantro, salt, & rice.
  Mix very thoroughly and allow to cool to room
  temperature. DUMPLINGS: Roll dough on a floured
  surface until forms a sheet approx. 1/8" thick. Lift
  the dough at this point, on the backs of your hands
  and stretch it until is paper- thin. Using either a
  glass or a cookie cutter, cut the dough into 3"
  circles. This will result in 72 - 76 circles. In the
  center of each circle, place 1 teaspoon of the lamb
  filling. Fold the circles in half enclosing the
  filling. Take a fork and press the edges of each
  dumpling to seal them. Lightly beat the egg. Brush the
  edges of the seal dumpling with beatten egg. Heat the
  peanut oil in deep-fat fryer until it is 375 degrees
  F. Deep fry the dumplings for 2 - 3 minutes each or
  until they are evenly browned. Drain well. Serve over
  rice or with soup. *NOTE*
     These may be made up & frozen. they keep well ij
  the freezer a month or better. You may also steam
  these tasty little dumplings and serve them with rice
  this way as well. I have tried them with beef filling,
  chicken filling, and was told by soem Kazakh friends
  that they may also be made with shrimp. ORIGIN: Tamara

      Title: KD'S 10 MINUTE TOMATO-FREE SAUCE
 Categories: Digest, Sept.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  Soy milk
      1 tb Plus 1 Tspn flour ( I use
           Whole wheat)
      4    To 8 cloves garlic (I am a
           Garlic fanatic)
      1 pn Basil
      1 pn Oregano
      1 pn Parsley
    1/4 c  Shredded Tofu-Rella Cheddar
           Cheese
    1/4 c  Shredded Tofu-Rella Jack
           Cheese
        x  Spike seasoning
      1 ts Margarine (optional)
 
  Tofu-Rella cheese can be found at most health food
  stores, I buy mine at Trader Joe's or Mothers Market,
  which are both California based.
  
  Directions:  Bring soy milk, garlic, basil, oregano,
  parsley, spike and margarine (which is optional) to a
  rolling boil.  Slowly SIFT the flour while continuing
  to stir as the flour will clump. After the flour is
  thoroughly disolved stir in the cheese until the sauce
  has thickened. If the sauce is not thick enough, add
  more cheese, if it is too thick add more soy milk.
  
  This tastes great over pasta, steamed vegetables and
  speghetti squash.
  
  For those of you that still eat seafood products,  I
  occasionally add imitation crab meat (white fish)
  towards the end as to not overcook the fish.
  
  Well, hope you enjoy this recipe!!  Let me know what
  you think of it!
  
  Happy eating!

    1/2 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
           Generous grindings of pepper
      3 tb Lemon juice
           Lime wedges
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F. Put the eggs, fish and rice in a
  large mixing bowl; toss together lightly to mix. Put
  the cream in a small saucepan, add the curry powder
  and nutmeg, heat, stirring until the spices are
  blended. Add the cream mixture, pepper, and lemon
  juice to the rice mixture, and gently toss. Taste for
  salt and seasoning and adjust if needed (the dish
  won't need any salt if the smoked fish is salty). Put
  the Kedgeree in a casserole and heat in oven only
  until piping hot. Serve on a platter surrounding
  softly scrambled eggs, and garnished with lime wedges.
  
  NOTE: To freshen finnan haddie, soak it in cold milk
  for an hour, drain then poach it in fresh milk. The
  milk sweetens the fish and tames its saltiness.

      1 c  Feta cheese, crumbled
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      2    Sprigs fresh mint; chopped
      1 ts Dried oregano
      1    Garlic clove; sliced
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
      1    Orange or lemon peel
           - cut into pieces
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
     16    Commercial filo sheets
      6 tb Butter (or more); melted
      3    Hard-boiled eggs; quartered
 
  On the island of Kefallinia in the Ionion Sea, the
  Feast Day of Analipseos (Ascension Day) is celebrated
  with the traditional "kreatopita" (meat-pie). This
  spicy pie also ushers in the beginning of Lent on the
  day of Apokreas.
  
  In a stock pot, cover the lamb bones with cold water.
  Simmer, covered for 1 hour. Strain, boil down to 1
  cup, and set aside. Sprinkle the lemon juice on the
  lamb cubes. Heat the oil or butter in a heavy pan, add
  the onions and lamb, and saute the meat on all sides
  until the onions are soft without browning. Pour the
  onions, lamb, and juices into a large bowl. Add the
  diced potatoes and carrot, rice, tomato puree, cheese,
  parsley, mint, oregano, garlic, cinnamon, and fruit
  peel and season with salt and freshly ground pepper.
  Add enough reserved lamb broth for liquid while pie
  bakes, then mix with a wooden spoon.
  
  Butter the bottom and sides of a 9 x 12 x 3 inch pan.
  Spread 8 filo sheets, brushing the melted butter in
  between the sheets, making sure the pastry fits the
  sides and bottom of the pan. Pour in the filling,
  spreading evenly with a spatula. Place the egg
  quarters here and there across the top and cover with
  the remaining filo sheets, brushing with butter as
  before. Flute the edges with two fingers or a fork and
  brush the top with butter. Using a sharp knife, score
  the top 3 filo sheets into square or diamond shapes,
  or prick the homemade pastry with a fork. Bake for 40
  to 50 minutes in moderately slow oven (325 F), raising
  the temperature to 350 F during the last 10 minutes.
  Remove from the oven and let stand on a rack for 15
  minutes. Remove from the oven and let stand on a rack
  for 15 minutes. Cut into diamonds or squares and serve
  warm.

 Categories: Seafood, Main dish, Appetizers

    1/4 c  Salt
      3 tb Dill seed
      3 lg Bunches Dill; fresh
     30    Crayfish; fresh-water, live

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
      1 bn Dill
           Toasted white bread
 
  "Scandinadian crayfish are small - about 3 inches in
  length - and are similar to the fresh-water crayfish
  of the Midwestern, Southern and Western United States.
  The Finns are extremely fond of these delicate
  shellfish and easily eat 10 to 20 apiece - usually
  accompanied by chilled vodka."
  In a 6-8 quart kettle, combine the water, salt, dill
  seed and 2 of the bunches of fresh dill ties with a
  string. Bring to a boil over high heat and boil
  briskly, uncovered for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, wash the
  crayfish carefully under cold running water. Drop
  them, a few at a time, into the rapidly boiling water.
  When all of the crayfish have been added, cover the
  kettle tightly and boil about 6 or 7 minutes. Line a
  2-3 quart bowl with the sprigs of the third bunch of
  fresh dill. Remove the crayfish from the kettle with a
  slotted spoon and arrange them in the bowl over the
  dill sprigs. Strain the stock over the crayfish
  through a fine sieve and let them rest in the liquid
  until they have reached room temperature. Then cover
  the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for
  at least 12 hours; they may marinate as long as 2 days
  if you wish. To serve, drain the crayfish of their
  liquid, pile them high on a platter and garnish with
  fresh dill. Although they can be served cold, the
  crayfish are at their best if they are allowed to
  reach room temperature. Serve with toast.

        E  *****
  
  Fry several rashers of bacon until they are crisp.
  Drain and keep warm. Then get some good beef sausages
  and fry them in the bacon fat. Cut them into slices
  and keep warm with the bacon.
  
  Now add some cooked, drained white haricot beans to
  the casserole dish and heat the beans through using
  the fat from the bacon and the sausages. Return the
  bacon and sausage slices to the beans. Then add
  **lots** of chopped fresh parsley and sliced fresh
  garlic. Stir though and serve at once.
  
  SOME NOTES. Lots of garlic and parsley means about 10
  cloves of garlic and a huge handful of parsley chopped
  up. Sometimes I will add fresh tomatoes, or maybe a
  splurge of fresh tomato sauce, or maybe a nice splash
  of Worchestershire sauce.

  3 1/2 lb Chicken cut up
 
  Put the Shallots, Garlic, and Candlenuts in a blender
  and work until smooth. Transfer to a deep pan or wok,
  add the rest of the ingredients. Simmer 1 to 1 1/2

      Title: KELLY'S ASIAN CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  3 1/2 lb Frying chicken cut
           -into serving pieces,
           -or equivalent in
           -chicken parts of
           -your choice
      3 tb Peanut oil
    3/4 c  Distilled white vinegar
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
      3 tb Honey
      1    Garlic bulb, peeled
           -and coarsely chopped
           -(yes that says BULB,
           -the whole head)
      2 sm Red peppers, dried
           -(hot -- optional)
 
  Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet and brown
  chicken on all sides (5-10 minutes).  Use medium-high
  heat.
  
  Add garlic and peppers about 1 minute before the end
  of the browning process. Add the remaining ingredients
  and cook over medium heat until chicken is done and
  sauce has reduced somewhat. This takes about 10
  minutes.
  
  If you are cooking white and dark meat together,
  remove the white meat first or it will dry out. Watch
  that sauce does not burn or boil away.
  
  Serve with rice, Chinese noodles or pasta.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken with garlic and hot peppers -- Another
  winner from "The Garlic Lover's Cookbook."  Don't let
  the amount of garlic scare you.
  
  *  When you look in the skillet to see how everything
  is going and to get a whiff of the lovely aroma, do
  not take a big whiff.  The vinegar will knock you out!
  
  *  This recipe won first place at a recent Garlic
  Cook-off at the Gilroy Garlic Festival.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  preparation:  5 minutes, cooking:  20 minutes.
  : Precision:  measure vinegar, soy sauce and honey.

           Canola oil (sesame

  1 1/2 c  Broccoli (florets and

     12 oz Straw mushrooms

    1/4 c  Chopped red bell pepper
      1 sm Can pineapple chunks
           -(unsweetened, be sure
           -to save the juice)
      1 sm Can mandarin orange slices
      1    Ripe mango, peeled, seeded,
           -and sliced

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Tamari
           Pineapple juice (leftover
           -from the can)
      3 tb Cornstarch (or enough
           -to make desired thickness)
      2 tb Water
      2 ts Grated fresh ginger
 
  First to go in the wok was the oil, scallions, and
  garlic.  Use enough oil so that it'll coat all the
  veggies but not make them slimy (I'd say about 1/2 -
  2/3 c.).  Heat these ingredients until the garlic
  starts to turn brown. Then add the pea pods, squash,
  and broccoli.  Cook about 3-5 min. Then add the bean
  sprouts, water chestnuts, bamboo, and peppers. Cook
  for a few more minutes, until veggies are slightly
  tender but still sort of crisp.
  Then add the pineapple, oranges, and mango.  Cook
  about a minute, then add the sauce.  When the sauce
  starts bubbling, the stir-fry is done.
  Serve over rice.  Yum!

    1/4 lb Fresh or frozen peas;
           - blanched 5 or 2 minutes
      2 ea Tb Oil; preferably peanut
      2 c  Long-grain rice; steamed and

      2 ea Eggs; beaten
      4 oz Fresh bean sprouts; about
           - 1 cup
           GARNISH
      2 ea Tb Scallions; finely chopped
 
  Drain peas in a colander. Heat a wok or large skillet
  until it is hot. Then add the oil and wait until it is
  almost smoking. Add the cooked rice and stir-fry it
  for 1 minute, and then add the barbecued pork, peas
  and salt. Continue to stir-fry the mixture for 5
  minutes over high heat. Next add the beaten eggs and
  bean sprouts and continue to stir-fry for 2 minutes or
  until the eggs have set. Turn the mixture onto a plate
  and garnish it with the scallions. Serve at once, or
  let it cool and serve as a cold rice salad. Here are
  some hints for fried rice. The cooked rice should be
  cool. Never put soy sauce into fried rice. Don't
  precook the egg. And, be sure the oil is hot enough to
  not saturate the rice.

    2/3 c  Chicken stock
      1 tb Rice wine or dry sherry
 
  TRIM THE BEAN SPROUTS at both ends. Peel the cucumber,
  split it in half lengthwise and remove the seeds with
  a teaspoon. Finely shred the cucumber into 3-inch
  lengths. Peel and finely shred the carrots into 3-inch
  lengths. Set the vegetables aside. Take all the meat
  off the cooked chicken and shred it into fine strips
  using a sharp knife or cleaver. Arrange the chicken
  strips on a platter and surround them with the bean
  sprouts, cucumbers and carrots. Combine all the
  ingredients for the dressing and mix them thoroughly.
  (I find an electric blender is useful for this, but
  you could use a screw-top jar and shake everything in
  it well.) Pour the dressing all over the chicken and
  vegetables and mix well. Serve at once.

  Egg Drop Soup is traditionally Chinese. Tomatoes are
  not. They were introduced less than 100 years ago, but
  nevertheless, they work wonderfully in this soup.
  
  PUT THE CHICKEN STOCK into a pot and bring to a
  simmer. If using fresh tomatoes, peel, seed and cut
  into 1-inch cubes. If using canned tomatoes, chop them
  into small chunks. Lightly beat the eggs, then combine
  them with sesame oil in a small bowl. Add the light
  soy sauce and salt to the simmering stock, and stir to
  mix them in well. Add the tomatoes and simmer for 5
  minutes. Next, stir in the scallions, and then add the
  egg mixture in a very slow, thin stream. Using a
  chopstick or fork, pull the egg slowly into strands.
  (Stirring the egg in a "figure 8" works well.) Garnish
  with the finely chopped scallion tops. Makes 4 to 6
  Servings

      Title: KENNET FRIED TROUT
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2 sm Trout, (6-8 oz each)
      2    Rashers streaky bacon
      1 tb (heaped) coarse oatmeal
      2 oz Unsalted or clarified butter
      1    Lemon
           A little plain flour
 
  Rub the skins of the cleaned and dried trout very
  gently with a good grinding of pepper - this makes the
  rich skin deliciously piquant when crisply fried -
  then dust lightly with flour and salt.  Warm a frying
  pan large enough to take the two fish.  Toast the
  oatmeal in it, or, for a richer dish, fry it.  Remove
  and reserve.  Cut the bacon into snippets; fry gently
  until the fat runs, then increase heat to crisp the
  bacon a little. Remove and keep hot.  Dice the butter
  and add 1-1/2 oz of it to the pan. When the butter
  foam dies down add the fish.  Press them down lightly
  to ensure they lie very flat, touching the pan base
  everywhere. After 4-5 minutes steady cooking in the
  bubbling butter, the skin on the underside of the fish
  should be crisp and golden brown.  Turn them carefully
  and fry on the second side in the same way.  Put the
  cooked fish on to warmed plates, scatter the bacon and
  oatmeal over them and keep hot.
  
  Wipe out the pan with kitchen paper.  Melt the
  remaining butter and cook to a rich shade of gold.
  Quickly add generous 1 teaspoon lemon juice and a
  little salt and pepper.  Swirl to mix well, pour over
  the trout and serve immediately with wedges of lemon.

 Categories: Cakes, Beverages, Christmas
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Raisins
    1/2 c  Bourbon
    1/4 c  Butter; softened
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      5    Eggs
      4 c  Flour; sifted
      2 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 pn Salt
      1 ts Lemon zest; grated
      1 tb Lemon juice
      1 c  Pecans; chopped
 
  Marinate raisins in 1 cup of the bourbon for at least
  1 hour, up to 12 hours; drain, reserving both raisins
  and bourbon. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter and
  flour a 10-inch Bundt cake pan or other tube-cake pan.
  Beat together the butter and sugar until light and
  fluffy. (For best results, use an electric mixer and
  start beating at a slow speed, gradually increasing to
  moderate. If you allow this process to take about 15
  minutes, the butter will be very pale and look
  something like whipped cream. This adds lightness to
  the cake.) Beat in the eggs 1 at a time, beating well
  after each. In another bowl, sift together 3 3/4 cups
  of the flour, baking powder, soda and salt. Combine
  reserved bourbon with the zest and lemon juice. Add
  dry ingredients to the butter mixture alternately with
  the bourbon mixture. Toss the remaining 1/4 cup of
  flour with the drained raisins and the pecans. Fold
  into batter. Bake about 11/2 hours or until the cake
  tests done. Cool about 10 minutes in the pan before
  turning out onto a rack. Brush the remaining 1/2 cup of
  bourbon over the cake while it is still somewhat warm.
  For long storage, wrap the cake in rinsed cheesecloth
  that has been thoroughly moistened in bourbon. Then
  wrap in plastic or foil so that it is airtight. The
  cake may be served after a day or two but is better if
  allowed to age.

      Title: KENTUCKY BOURBON TRUFFLES
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 24 Truffles
 
    1/2 lb Dark semisweet chocolate*
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
  1 1/2 tb Finest Kentucky bourbon
           Droste cocoa or
           Shaved chocolate Drayettes
 
  *Callebaut, Lindt, Tobler or any fine imported
  chocolate.
  
  Break chocolate into small pieces.  Combine it with
  the cream in the top of a double boiler over simmering
  hot water (not boiling).  Stir the chocolate and cream
  constantly until chocolate has melted and ganache is
  smooth. Remove from heat and allow to cool.  When the
  ganache has cooled, stir in bourbon.
  
  Pour the mixture into a small bowl.  Cover with foil
  and refrigerate overnight or several days if desired.
  
  When ready to make the candy, line a baking sheet with
  foil.
  
  Working with a small amount of the ganache at a time,
  using about 1 1/2 tsp. each, form into balls.  Place
  them on the sheet.  (Work quickly, using your
  fingertips and not the palm of your hands to help keep
  the mixture from becoming overly soft.)
  
  Keep the chocolate balls cold, if possible, by placing
  them a few at a time on a tray in the refrigerator.
  Leave the chocolate balls lightly covered in the
  refrigerator for several hours or overnight, if
  desired.
  
  Sprinkle a pastry sheet with cocoa or chocolate
  shavings or Drayelle. Roll each ball into the cocoa or
  shavings, covering them well. Refrigerate at once and
  leave until the truffles are quite firm - several
  hours or overnight.
  
  Place each truffle in a fluted silver or paper cup in
  a tin box and keep refrigerated.
  
  Serve very cold.  Will keep several weeks under
  refrigeration.
  
  Glenn writes: "All the world loves chocolate, and
  chocolate truffles are the world's most luscious
  trompe l'oeil.  We have no clue as to the name of the
  clever cook who first created these candies so
  beautifully camouflaged in the shape of a truffle, but
  it would be a very safe bet that he was a Frenchman -
  and from truffle country.
  
  "In contrast to most hand-dipped chocolates, which, to
  a great extent belong in the province of the
  professional candy maker and should look precisely
  turned out, chocolate truffles are supposed to look
  somewhat rugged.  If they looked too neat and evenly
  rounded, they wouldn't resemble their namesake - the
  knobbly real-life Perigord truffle.
  
  "No pig is needed to sniff around in the deep forest
  of the Perigord to find where these truffles grow!
  All one needs is a small kitchen space, a
  double-boiler of sorts, a spoon or two, a baking
  sheet, and a cold spot to let the candy chill."
  
  "In every phase of the culinary arts, flavor is
  everything; and premium ingredients must be used to
  achieve the subtle counterpoint of flavors that are
  possible with the candies given here.
  
  "The ideal way to store or to prepare truffles as
  gifts is to place each one in a tiny fluted silver or
  paper cup made for the purpose, then fit them in
  single layers in a tight tin box.  Wrap the box as
  happily as you wish.  Few gifts could say 'Have a
  Merry Christmas!' any better.
  
  "Bourbon whiskey has a great affinity for chocolate;
  however, no whiskey or liqueur can be added directly
  to any chocolate; it hardens it beyond repair.  In
  using liqueurs when making chocolate candies,
  frostings, etc., the alcohol must be combined with
  cream first.  The French call the combination of
  chocolate and cream a 'ganache' and that is the base
  of many candies, especially truffles."
  
  From Camille Glenn's 12/01/93 "Flavor to Taste" column
  called "Visions of Sugarplums: These Truffles and
  Candies Just Shout 'Merry Christmas'" in "The

      Title: KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN COLE SLAW DRESSING
 Categories: Salad
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
  4 1/2 tb Tarragon Vinegar
  6 1/2 tb Vegetable oil
    3/4 c  Chopped onion
  2 1/2 c  Miracle Whip
      1 c  Sugar
      2    Carrots, peeled
      2    Medium-large heads cabbage
 
  Mix oil and onions, add sugar and Tarragon Vinegar.
  Fold in Miracle Whip. Can be made with Miracle Whip
  Fat Free (I have tried this and it still tastes the
  same).  Do not substitute Tarragon Vinegar with plain
  vinegar. The Tarragon is the secret seasoning.  Best
  if made the night before serving so the flavors all
  blend well.  Will keep a long time in refrigerator.

  lumpy). Lightly oil the griddle or large frying pan.
  Heat over medium high heat until a drop of water will
  dance across the surface. Stir the batter and drop a
  test cake ( 1/4 cup of batter) on the griddle. Cook
  until the bubbles burst on the top surface and the
  bottom is light brown. Turn and cook the other side
  until it is browned (1-2 minutes). (Add more
  buttermilk to the batter if the first cake does not
  spread well.) Serve the griddle cakes with the warm

  of pork and fat. Plain lean pork will not taste as
  good.) Cut meat into one-inch cubes. Peel and thinly
  slice potatoes. Peel or wipe mushrooms, and slice if
  large. Grease a large ovenproof dish with some of the
  butter, and place a layer of sliced potatoes in the
  bottom. Add half the meat pieces, seasoned and
  sprinkled with rosemary. Layer with half the
  vegetables, plus another layer of potatoes.  Repeat,

 Categories: Desserts, Cakes
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           -Dorothy Cross TMPJ72B
           -DIRECTIONS:
 
  To make cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Brush the
  inside of an 8-inch (6-cup) bundt or a 9-inch (8-cup)
  spring form tube pan with margarine or oil or spray
  with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside. In a small
  mixing bowl, stir together flour, baking powder and
  salt. In a large mixing bowl, beat margarine (or
  butter and oil) with electric beaters until softened
  and blended. Gradually add sugar and beat until well
  blended. Gradually beat in eggs. Beat in lime zest and
  juice. Using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula,
  alternatively stir the dry ingredients and buttermilk
  into the egg mixture, beginning and ending with the
  dry ingredients. Spoon the mixture into the prepared
  pan and bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a cake
  tester inserted into the center comes out clean and
  the cake starts to pull away from the sides of the
  pan. Loosen edges and invert onto a wire rack set over
  a plate. To make syrup: In a small bowl, whisk
  together confectioners' sugar and lime juice. While
  the cake is still warm, poke holes in it using a
  skewer or cake tester. Slowly spoon the lime syrup
  over the cake, spooning any juice that accumulates on
  the plate below over the cake. (The cake can be
  prepared ahead and stored, covered, in the
  refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Bring to room
  temperature before serving.) Just before serving, sift
  a little confectioners' sugar over the cake. Serves 8.

  tree, with its thorny branches, produces yellow limes
  that resemble small lemons. Since Key limes can be
  expensive and are not always easy to find, Persian
  (green) limes or bottled Key lime juice from the local
  grocery store can be substituted.

 Categories: Cookies, Desserts
      Yield: 30 Cookies
 
      1 c  Sweetened condensed milk
      4 tb Key lime juice
      4 tb All-purpose flour
      2 c  Unsweetened coconut flakes
      4 tb Sugar
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease 2 baking sheets.
  
  Combine the condensed milk, Key lime juice, and flour
  in a medium bowl. Stir in the grated coconut and then
  the sugar.  If using sweetened coconut, taste the
  mixture before adding the sugar.  Add the sugar only
  if you think it is necessary.  The cookie should have
  a tangy flavor from the Key lime juice.  Drop
  teaspoons of the mixture onto a baking sheet, leaving
  2 inches between each cookie; they will spread while
  baking. Bake for 25 minutes until they just start to
  turn golden. Remove from the pan to a rack to cool.
  Store in an airtight container.

  9"      ea baked pastry shell I got this recipe from a
  "Cracker," and it will dispute the previous statement
  that all will agree on how to make the best Key Lime
  Pie. My tree froze, but came back, so we've enjoyed
  this recipe a lot this year. Mix togethe gelatin, 1/3
  c sugar and salt in saucepan. Combine slightly beaten
  egg yolks, water & lime juice. Add to gelatin mixture.
  Place over low heat, stirring constantly, until
  gelatin dissolves, about 6 min. Remove from heat and
  add rind. Cool. Beat egg whites until stiff but not
  dry. Gradually add remaining 1/3 c sugar and beat
  until stiff. Fold in gelatin mixture. Turn into pastry
  shell and chill until firm. Garnish with whipped cream
  and lime slices if desired. Note: To make lime chiffon
  cream pie, fold in 1/2 c heavy cream, whipped before
  turning into pastry shell. This is a much lighter pie
  than the one using sweetened consensed milk, and I
  think it has a more of the flavor of Key limes. Ann,

      Title: KEY LIME PIE *** (SRRH02A)
 Categories: Pies, Desserts, American
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      5 ea Egg yolks
      1 cn Sweetened condensed milk
    2/3 c  Key Lime Juice; or
    1/3 c  Lemon juice
    1/3 c  Lime juice
      5 ea Egg whites
      6 tb Sugar
    1/8 ts Cream of tarter
      1 ea Baked pie crust; or
      1 ea Graham cracker crust
 
  If there is one thing most Florida Crackers will agree
  on is the proper way to make a Key Lime Pie..and one
  thing we hate is how many variations there are..green
  food coloring? UGH! Most of the Key lime trees in
  Central Fla. have been frozen so its hard to get fresh
  juice.Don't use the bottled.We use equal amounts from
  Persian limes and lemons. Sweetened condensed milk was
  used before re- frigeration. Eagle Brand is the old
  stand-by but any brand will do. You may use a graham
  cracker crust - most folks do now because it takes
  chilling better than the regular pastry crust does..We
  have trouble here in Florida with humidity so
  sometimes we use whipped cream as a topping instead of
  meringue. I always take a chance with the meringue and
  if it runs the kids just say "Mom has made Key Lime
  Soup again" and eat it anyhow. This recipe is the way
  all my Conch relatives make it. They've been in Key
  West since 1800. Beat egg yolks until pale yellow.
  Blend in milk and add lime juice stirring unitl
  smooth. Pour into pie shell and top with meringue or
  whipped cream. Meringue Beat egg whites at high speed
  until foamy. Add cream of tarter; beat until soft
  peaks form ~ reduce speed and gradually add sugar.
  Beat again at high speed until soft glossy peaks form.
  Heap on pie , sealing the edges well and bake in 350F
  oven approximately 15 minutes. Cool at room
  temperature then chill. Youall enjoy ya hear... Babs

      Title: KEY LIME PIE 2
 Categories: Desserts, Pies
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
      1    9-inch graham-cracker pie
           -shell
      5 lg Egg yolks
     14 oz (1 can) sweetened condensed
           -milk
    1/2 c  Key lime juice (or 3/4 c
           -regular lime juice)

MMMMM--------------------OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS-------------------------
      1    Lime, finely grated zest
      1 c  Heavy whipping cream
      3 tb Confectioners' sugar
 
  Note on the limes:  *Key* limes are supposed to be
  used - they're a bit smaller and are more tart than
  the regular limes you see in the market. Ask your
  grocer if he/she can get 'em - they make a better pie.
  Because the key limes are more tart, you have to use a
  bit less juice than when you have the regular ones...
  
  Directions: Preheat the oven to 350F. Put the yolks
  into a large bowl and beat 'em with a fork or a wire
  whisk. Don't kill 'em, just blend 'em together. Then
  slowly blend in the condensed milk, a bit at a time.
  Then do the same for the lime juice. The next step is
  optional ~ you can either blend in the grated rind, or
  you can sprinkle it on top of the pie before baking,
  or you can leave it out altogether.  My personal
  preference is to blend it in.
  
  Now - pop it in your preheated oven and bake for 13-15
  minutes.
  
  While it's baking, whip the cream, slowly adding the
  confectioner's sugar while you're whipping.
  
  After it's done baking, let it cool for an hour or so
  on a wire rack, then transfer it to the refrigerator
  to chill.  Some people like it at room temperature,
  but I prefer it chilled.  If you leave it out *too*
  long, it goes runny.
  
  Now that it's chilled, you can use the whipped cream
  to garnish the whole pie, induvidual slices, or
  whatever. I usually garnish induvidual slices with a
  lice of lime split & twisted.
  
  Serve with strong, hot, black coffee.  Preferably with
  a shot of Bushmill's added.

 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    3/8 c  Lime juice
      1    Lime or lemon rind grated
      1    Eggs
      1    Pie shell 9 inch
      3 tb -Water hot
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  -Water
 
  Beat the egg yolks, add the lime juice, grated rind,
  hot water, salt and 1/2 cup of sugar.Cook this mixture
  in a double boiler until it thickens. Add 1/2 cup of
  the sugar(or what is remainder) to the stiffly beaten
  egg whites. Fold into the cooked mixture and spoon
  into the pie shell. Bake in 350 degree oven for 10
  minutes. This pie can be garnished with whipping
  cream. Because of the danger of uncooked egg yolks
  this recipe is often as alternative to the older
  versions. Especially in the United States it is
  recommended that uncooked egg yolks should not be used
  under any circumstances.

      4 ea Egg yolks
    1/3 ea To 1/2 cup bottled key lime
      1 ea Unbaked 9" graham cracker pi

  This is mighty tasty and quite easy to make: Pre-heat
  oven to 325. In a medium-sized bowl, mix together
  sweetened con. milk and egg yolks until well-blended.
  Slowly stir in the lime juice ( for more tart flavor,
  use 1/2 cup juice), stirring gently just until
  blended. Pour into pie crust and bake for 10 minutes.
  Allow to cool at room temperature, then chill before
  serving. Top with whip cream, if desired...I think
  it's best with the whipped cream. Note: This recipe
  leaves room in the crust for whipped cream. If more
  filling is desired, increase the filling proportions
  by 1/2.

           -Taste
    1/4 c  Olive Oil
  1 1/4 c  Onions; Finely Chopped
    1/2 c  Cilantro; Finely Chopped
 
  Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl and make a
  well in the middle. Pour in the egg, oil, and club
  soda and stir into the flour, adding more club soda if
  necessary, ot make a rather soft dough.  Transfer the
  dough to a floured board and knead until smooth and
  elastic, about 10 minutes. Shape the dough into a
  ball, cover with a linen or cotton (not terry cloth)
  kitchen towel and let stand for 1 hour.  Divide the
  dough into four parts and shape each one into a ball.
  Let stand, covered, for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven
  to 350 Degrees F. and butter two large baking sheets.
  On a floured surface, roll out one of the balls into
  an 1/8-inch thick square. Brush the dough with some of
  the melted butter  Dip your fingers into the melted
  butter and pull the edges of the dough in different
  directions, stretching it evenly until it is almost
  transparently thin. Don't worry if the dough tears, as
  you will be folding it up.  With a sharp knife, trim
  the edges of the dough to from an even square.  Fold
  the square in half, brush the surface generously with
  the melted d fold in half again crosswise to from a
  smaller square.  It should be approximately 6 to 7
  inches. It is isn't, pull it out slightly to fit the
  dimensions. Brush the square with butter.  Shape
  one-fourth of the filling into a ball and place in the
  center of the square.  Fold in the corners of the
  square like an envelope. With the palm of your hand,
  flatten the pie so it is about 1 inch thick. Brush the
  top with melted butter and carefully transfer to a
  prepared baking sheet.  Repeat the procedure with the
  rest of the dough and filling. Bake the pies in the
  middle of the oven, until golden brown, about 35
  minutes.  Serve warm.
  
  Makes 4 Pies for 8 Servings
  
  RED BEAN FILLING:
  
  Drain the beans and place them in a saucepan along
  with enough fresh water to cover by at least 2-inches.
  Bring to a boil and add salt, then reduce the heat to
  medium-low.  Cook the beans, partially covered, until
  almost mushy, about 1 1/2 hours.  While the beans are
  cooking, heat the oil in a medium size skillet, over
  medium heat, and add the onion to saute it. Stir
  occasionally, until dark brown, about 15 to 20
  minutes.  When the beans are done, drain well and
  mash.  Add the sauteed onions and their cooking fat
  and the cilantro.  Season generously with salt and
  freshly ground black pepper.  Cool to room temperature.
  
  Makes enough filling for 4 pies.

      Title: KHAO PAD SAPPAROT (STIR FRIED RICE & PINEAP
 Categories: Thai, Fruits, Rice
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 md Pineapple, sweet & juicy
    2/3 tb Chopped shallots (purple
           -onion)
    1/2 tb Grated ginger
  13/16    Red chilis finely julienned
      2    Green of 2 spring onions,
           -coarsely chopped
      1 tb Chopped coriander/cilantro
      2 tb Dried shrimp
    2/3 tb Garlic, coarsely chopped
      1 tb (to 2) fish sauce
      1 ts Sugar
      2 c  Steamed rice, cold(garnish)
           Coriander leaves  (garnish)
 
  Cut the pineapple in half lengthwise, and scoop out
  the fruit (my wife uses a curved "grapefruit knife",
  but any knife will do...) then chop it into bite sized
  chunks.
  
  Put the fruit in a bowl and add the shallots, chili,
  ginger, scallion and coriander, mix and set aside. Add
  a pinch of salt to bring out the juice...
  
  In a wok, heat about a tablespoon of oil, and stir fry
  the shrimp until crispy, and the oil is aromatic.
  Remove the shrimp with a slotted spoon and drain, then
  set aside.
  
  Add a further tablespoon of oil, and stir fry the
  garlic until golden brown. Add the rice, and stir
  thoroughly. Add the fish sauce and sugar, and continue
  stirring. When the rice is heated through, add the
  pineapple mixture and cooked shrimp, and stir until
  thoroughly heated through.
  
  Pour the mixture into the pineapple shells, garnish
  and serve.
  
  Note: if you prefer fried rice to be darkish brown in
  colour, then replace half the fish sauce with dark
  sweet soy sauce.
  
  Variation: do not cook the fruit mixture. Instead put
  the fruit mixture and the stir fried rice in the
  fridge (separately) and chill all the ingredients,
  then just before serving mix them and put them in the
  pineapple skins. If you are serving cold then you can
  also add a few mareschino cherries as garnish. This
  cold variant makes an excellent counterpoint to hot
  curries and spicy chilli dishes on a hot day (and it
  gets *hot* here I can assure you, with the shade
  temperature topping 40 celsius on many a day.)
  
  This is an unusual recipe for Thai food because it is
  essentially a vegetarian dish - they are not common in
  Thailand, where even nominally vegetarian dishes often
  have quite a large amount of meat. This one has a
  little dried shrimp, and the true vegetarian could
  easily leave that out.
  
  It is also unusual in that it is rather a theatrical
  dish: though the theatricality comes from a Thai
  habbit of frugality, and perhaps a desire to have less
  dishes to wash!
  
  For two people you need a medium sized pineapple:
  choose carefully it should be sweet and juicy.

  ~----------------- Place rice in a large saucepan.
  Rinse twice to clean the rice, draining thoroughly.
  Add the water to the rice.
  
  Cover the saucepan and heat to boiling.  Allow to boil
  on high heat for 1 minute.  Turn the temperature to
  low and steam for 10 minutes.  Reduce the heat to the
  lowest setting and allow to steam for 10 minutes more.

      Title: KHAO-TUNG HNA-TUNG (CRUSTY RICE WITH SHRIMP D
 Categories: Appetizers, Seafood, Thai
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Long Grain Rice.
      6 c  Water.

MMMMM----------------------------DIP---------------------------------
      1 c  Raw Shrimp (Ground/Chopped).
      3 c  Coconut Milk. *
    1/2 c  Shallots or Onions, Chopped.
      2 tb Cilantro Roots & Stem, Mash.
      2 tb Garlic, Chopped.
      2 tb Tomato Paste.
    1/2 c  Peanuts, Crushed Fine.
      3 tb Fish Sauce.
    1/4 c  Sugar.
           Cilantro Leaves, Chopped.
           Fresh Red Chili Peppers.
 
  * 3 cups of coconut milk can be made fresh, if
  desired, by mixing 1 pound of grated, fresh coconut
  meat with 2-1/2 cups of hot (not boiling) water. Mix
  well, and work the mixture bu hands.  Strain and
  squeeze out resulting liquid and discard the meat. TO
  MAKE BASIC "CRUSTY RICE": Wash rice, if needed, and
  put into a pot or sauce pan. Add the 6 cups of water
  and put on medium heat till the rice is thoroughly
  cooked and the water had almost totally evaporated.
  Take the pot of rice off the heat and put aside to
  cool (rice should resemble a "soggy mess"). Lightly
  coat a shallow tray or cookie sheet with oil, add some
  of the cooked rice and spread into a thin layer.  You
  may need several trays, depending on their size.  Put
  the tray(s) out to dry in the sun (or into a warm
  oven). When the rice starts to dry (but not yet fully
  dry), use a knife to cut the sheet of rice into 2"-3"
  squares. Turn the pieces over and continue to dry
  thoroughly. The squares of crusty rice can now be
  either deep fried till lightly browned, or toasted.
  If fried, drain well.  They can be stored for several
  days in airtight jar. SHRIMP DIP:
  Place the coconut milk into a sauce pan and add the
  crushed cilantro roots/stems, chopped garlic, ground
  (chopped) raw shrimp meat.  Stir well and put on
  medium heat.  Stir till the coconut milk starts to
  boil, and continue to cook till the shrimp meat is
  cooked.  Add tomato paste and chopped shallot (onion).
  Continue cooking for a few more minutes till the
  shallot is cooked.  Add fish sauce, sugar, and crushed
  peanuts. Bring to a second boil and take off the heat.
  Serve warm in a bowl, with either toasted or fried
  crusty rice squares. Garnished the dip with chopped
  cilantro leaves and slices of medium hot red chili
  peppers.

      Title: KHEER
 Categories: Desserts, Ethnic, India
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 c  Milk
      1 tb Long grained rice
      4    Whole cardomom pods;
           -slightly crushed
      1 tb Sugar
     10    Pistachios, unsalted and
           -slivered, plus a few for
           -garnish
 
  Combine themilk, rice, and cardamom pods in a
  heavy-bottomed pot.  Bring to a boil.  Lower the heat
  and reduce the milk until you have 2 cups.* This may
  take 1-1 1/4 hours.  Turn off heat. Remove cardamom
  pods and discard.  Add sugar and nuts,  Mix well and
  leave to cool.  Mix again and pour into a serving
  bowl.  Decorate with a few more slivered pistachios on
  top.  Cover bowl with light plastic wrap. Refrigerate.
  Serve cold.
  
  *Note:  How to boil milk down
  1 Use a very heavy-bottomed pot.  Cast iron or
  aluminium covered with porcelain.
  2 Since the process is slow and tedious bring a chair
  and book to stove. 3 Bring the milk to an "almost"
  boil.  Watch it.  If you let it boil over you will
  have a big mess to clean.  As soon as it seems that
  the milk will start to boil and rise, turn heat sown
  to medium low. 4 Adjust heat so that milk is always
  bubblingm but will not boil over. 5 Once the milk has
  begun its slow boil, settle down with your book.  Stir
  milk every few minutes. 6 If a creamy crust forms on
  top, just stir it into the milk.  It will taste fine
  when cold.

      Title: KHEER (SWEET RICE)
 Categories: Desserts, Indian
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    1/3 c  Rice, short or medium grain
     10 c  Milk
    1/4 ts Ground cardamom
      1    Bay leaf
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 tb Almonds, sliced; lightly
           -toasted (opt)
 
  [Yes, these proportions *are* right, only 1/3 cup
  uncooked rice to 10 cups milk.]
  
  Wash the rice and set it aside to drain.  In a tall
  pot that can hold at least twice the volume of the
  milk, bring the milk to a boil; then adjust the heat
  so the milk is always rising and frothing, but not
  bubbling over. To minimize the cooking time, let the
  milk boil vigorously, uncovered, for the first 15
  minutes, while you stir it rhythmically with a wooden
  spatula to prevent the thick milk on the bottom of the
  post from scorching.
  
  Drop the rice into the milk along with the bay leaf.
  Continue stirring. Keep over medium-high heat and stir
  very carefully for another 20 minutes until the rice
  breaks up and rolls with the milk. By now the milk
  should be reduced to two thirds of its original
  volume. Stir in the sugar, cardamom, and almonds.
  Cook for 5 more minutes and remove from the heat.
  Sweet rice should be only slightly thick when removed
  from the heat, because it will thicken when
  refrigerated. Chill well before serving.
  
  For other classic flavours, replace the cardamom with
  a teaspoon of rose water and a few pinches of saffron
  powder.

 Categories: Indian, Grains, Side dish, Vegetables
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 c  Basmati rice
    3/4 c  Moong dal
      8 c  ;Water
    1/3 c  Raw cashews
    1/2 c  Raw almonds
    1/4 c  Coconut
    3/4 c  Peas
    3/4 c  Carrots
      3    Inch piece of cinnamon
      8    Whole cloves
      1    Whole red chile
      2 ts Sugar (Optional)
    1/4 ts Asafetida, yellow
    1/3 c  Currants - Raisins
      1 ts Cumin
      1 ts Black mustard seeds
           Parsley or cilantro
           Garam masala
 
  First rinse the following ingredients separately:
  rice, dal, almonds, cashews, coconut and currants.
  
  In a heavy pan, heat the water to boiling.
  
  While waiting for the water to boil, toast the almonds
  and cashews in a dab of ghee. Just before nuts are
  toasted, add the coconut and toast all until brown.
  Remove nut mixture from pan; set aside.
  
  Next toast the cumin and black mustard seeds in a dab
  of ghee. Cover pot while toasting, due to mustard
  seeds popping while cooking.  Cook spices for 1 to 2
  minutes.  Remove from pan; set aside.
  
  When water boils, add the dal and cook for about 2
  minutes. The dal will foam up in the cooking process,
  so remove the foam after two minutes. Then add the
  rice and all of the spices. Boil, covered, for about 1
  more minute.
  
  Turn the fire off under the rice mixture and let sit.
  
  Toast the carrots and peas in a dab of ghee while the
  rice is sitting. The rice will be ready to have the
  remaining ingredients added after the veggies are
  cooked.  (I like to leave the carrots somewhat al
  dente.)
  
  Open the pot and sprinkle garam masala over the rice
  and then add the cleaned raisins, veggies, and half of
  the nut mixture, in that order.
  
  Sprinkle again with garam masala. Cover and let sit
  for a short time.
  
  Transfer the rice to a large bowl and stir the dish
  until all ingredients are completely blended. Sprinkle
  some more garam masala for looks and add the remaining
  nuts for a garnish.

 Categories: Breads, Lebanese
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      6 c  Plain flour
      1 pk Active dry yeast
      2 c  Warm water
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar
      2 tb Oil
 
  Makes 8 loaves Oven temperature: 260 C (500 F) Cooking
  time: 4-5 minutes
  
  Sift flour into a large mixing bowl and warm in a low
  oven.
  
  Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm water, add remaining
  water and stir in salt and sugar.
  
  Remove about 2 cups flour from bowl and set aside.
  Pour yeast liquid into centre and stir in some flour
  to make a thick liquid.  Cover with cloth and leave in
  a warm place until frothy.
  
  Stir in rest of flour, adding oil gradually, then beat
  until smooth, either by hand for 10 minutes, or on
  electric mixer using dough hook for 5 minutes.
  
  Sprinkle some of the reserved flour onto a board, turn
  out dough and knead for 10 minutes, using more flour
  as required.  Dough is ready when it is smooth and
  satiny with a slightly wrinkled texture.  Shape dough
  into a ball.
  
  Oil bowl, put in dough smooth side down then turn over
  so that top is coated with oil.  Stretch plastic wrap
  over bowl and leave in a warm place to rise until
  almost doubled in bulk -- about 1 to 1-1/2 hours.
  Preheat oven.
  
  Punch down dough and turn out onto lightly floured
  board.  Knead for a minute or so, then divide into 8
  equal pieces, rolling each into a ball.
  
  Roll each piece into a 25 cm (10 inch) round and place
  on a lightly floured cloth.  Cover with another cloth
  and leave for 20 minutes.
  
  Heat a large baking sheet or flat griddle on the
  lowest shelf in an electric oven; in a gas oven select
  the section of the oven with the most heat, probably
  near the top.
  
  Place a round of dough on a lightly floured baking
  sheet with one flat edge or on a piece of plywood,
  spreading it evenly.  Shake to ensure that it will
  slide off easily.
  
  Rub heated baking sheet or griddle with wad of paper
  towel dipped in oil then slide dough onto it.  Bake in
  hot oven for 4-5 minutes until it puffs up like a
  balloon.  If you would like it browned on top, turn
  quickly and leave for a minute.  Remove bread and wrap
  in a cloth to keep it warm and soft.  Bake remaining
  loaves.
  
  To bake in an electric frypan (a good alternative if
  your gas oven does not heat evenly):  Preheat frypan
  on highest setting with metal lid on, vent closed.
  When heated, oil base quickly and slide dough onto
  base. Cover and cook for 3 minutes, remove lid, turn
  bread over, re-cover and cook further 2 minutes.

 Categories: Bakery, Breads
      Yield: 8 Rd. loaves
 
  2 3/4 c  Lukewarm water
      2 pk Active dry yeast
      1 pn Sugar
      8 c  All purpose flour
      2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      1 c  Cornmeal
 
  Pour 1/4 cup of lukewarm water into a small bowl and
  sprinkle it with the yeast and sugar.  Let the mixture
  rest for 2 or 3 minutes, then stir to dissolve the
  yeast completely.  Set the bowl in a warm, draft free
  place (such as a turned off oven) for 5 minutes, or
  until the mixture doubles in volume.
  In a deep bowl, combine the flour and salt, make a
  well in the center, and pour in the yeast mixture, the
  olive oil and 2 cups of lukewarm water.
  Gently stir the center ingredients together, then
  incorporate the flour and continue to beat until the
  ingredients are well combined. Add up to 1/2 cup more
  lukewarm water, beating it in a tablespoon at a time,
  and using as much as necessary to from a dough that
  can be gathered into a compact ball. If the dough is
  difficult to stir, work in the water with your fingers.
  Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead
  by pressing it down, pushing it forward several times
  with the heel of your hand and folding it back on
  itself.  Repeat for 20 minutes, or until the dough is
  smooth and elastic.  Shape the dough into a ball and
  place it in a lightly oiled bowl.  Drape loosely with
  a towel and set aside in the warm place for 45
  minutes, or until the dough doubles in bulk. Punch it
  down with a blow of your fist and divide it into 8
  equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball about 2 1/2
  inches in diameter, cover the balls with a towel and
  let them rest for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 500
  degrees (F).  Sprinkle 2 large baking sheets with 1/2
  cup of the cornmeal or flour.  On a lightly floured
  surface, roll 4 of the balls into round loaves each
  about 8 inches in diameter and no more than 1/8 inch
  thick.  Arrange them 2 to 3 inches apart on the baking
  sheets, cover with towels and allow them to rest for
  30 minutes. If you have a gas oven, bake the bread on
  the flour of the oven for 5 minutes, then transfer the
  loaves to a shelf 3 or 4 inches above the oven floor
  and continue baking for 5 minutes, or until they puff
  up in the center and are a delicate brown.  If your
  oven is electric, bake the bread on the lowest shelf
  for 5 minutes, then raise it 3 or 4 inches and
  continue baking until the breads are puffed and
  browned. Remove the bread from the baking sheets, wrap
  each loaf in foil, and set aside for 10 minutes.
  Sprinkle the pans with the remaining 1/2 cup of
  cornmeal or flour and bake the remaining 4 loaves of
  bread in a similar fashion.
  When the loaves are unwrapped the tops will have
  fallen and there will be a shallow pocket of air in
  their centers.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

      Title: KIBBEE
 Categories: Lamb/mutton, Lebanese
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Leg of lamb (have fat &
           -bone removed; ground fine
           -twice) Approx. 4-5 pounds
      1 c  Bulgur wheat; soaked for
           -1/2 hour in warm water
      1 lg Onion; grated
           Salt; to taste
           Pepper; to taste
      1 ds Cinnamon
      1 ds Allspice
    1/3 c  Pine nuts
 
  Squish wheat in hands to remove water.  Then mix all
  ingredients well. Taste to see if you need more
  spices.   (It's ok to eat this raw; indeed, it is
  considered a delicacy, although personally I prefer it
  cooked!)
  
  Grease a large baking pan, at least 13x9 or larger.
  
  Divide meat in half.  Make bottom layer.  Flatten with
  hands until even. Add pine nuts.
  
  Add top layer of meat and flatten until even.  Cut
  diagonal lines in both directions, not all the way
  through, so have diamond pattern. Dot well with butter
  and Crisco, more butter (or margarine) than Crisco.
  Use half teaspoonfuls at a time.  Should be a pat
  every couple inches or so...
  
  Bake for 1 1/2 hours at 350 degrees, or until brown.

 Categories: India, Lamb/mutton
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------STUFFING-------------------------------
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 lb Coarsely ground lamb
      2 tb Pine nuts
      1 lg Onion; finely chopped
           Salt to taste
           Ground allspice; to taste

MMMMM---------------------------KIBBEE--------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Fine bulgur
      2 lb Ground lamb; finely ground
    1/4 c  Cold water
      2    Medium onion; grated
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Ground allspice
      1 pn Nutmeg; grated, pinch
      1 pn Cayenne pepper (optional)
      3 tb Butter; room temperature
 
  Preheat the oven to 375F. Make the stuffing. Heat the
  oil in a saucepan and add the coarsely ground lamb,
  the pine nuts, onion, salt, and allspice. Cook,
  stirring, until browned. Set aside to cool as you make
  the kibbee base. Make the kibbee. Soak the bulgur in
  water to cover for 10 minutes or until softened. Drain
  well. Add the finely ground lamb, cold water, and
  onions and knead the mixture well. Keep moistening
  your hands so the mixture does not stick to them.
  Knead in the spices. Some like a thick kibbee, some a
  flatter one. About 1 1/2 inches is a good height.
  Depending on the height you want, butter a round or
  rectuangular baking pan with 1 Tbl of the butter.
  (About 10 inches in diameter is fine for 1 1/2-inch
  high kibbee.) With wet hands, press half the kibbee
  mixture into the pan, patting it level. Spread the
  stuffing evenly over the base. Cover with the rest of
  the kibbee mixture and pat with moistened hands. With
  a knife dipped in cold water, cut a diamond pattern
  through the layers. Dot with the remaining butter.
  Bake for 10 minutes, then lower the heat to 325F. Bake
  for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until browned and
  bubbling. Do not overcook. Serve hot with yogurt and
  salad. Instead of making if one big fat kibbee, I like
  to make "meatballs." I take about 2 Tbl of meat
  mixture and flatten in the palm of my hand. Then I
  take about 1-2 tsp of filling and put that in the
  middle of the meat. Then I take another 2 Tbl of meat
  mixture, flatten and place over the meat with the
  filling. Shape into oval-shaped meatballs. Bake the
  same way as above.

      2 c  All-purpose flour
 
  Place sugar, spices, salt and baking soda in a large
  bowl. Stir in water until sugar is dissolved. Stir in
  butter until melted, then molasses. Gradually stir in
  about 1 1/2 cups flour. Continue stirring in remaining
  flour a little at a time. When dough becomes stiff,
  flour hands and knead until firm enough to roll out.
  Roll out right away, or wrap and refrigerate for up to
  2 weeks or freeze. To roll out, place half of dough on
  a lightly floured board. Roll to 1/4-inch thickness.
  Use a floured cookie cutter to cut out shapes. Place
  on a greased baking sheet. Bake in a preheated 300F
  oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until edges are firm.
  Store in a covered container at room temperature. This
  recipe can be doubled easily. Makes about 34 (3-inch)
  star-shaped cookies.

 Categories: Cookies, Christmas, Hungarian
      Yield: 6 Dozen
 
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
  4 3/4 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
      2 c  Butter or margarine
      4 lg Egg yolks, slightly beaten
      1 c  Sour cream

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
  1 1/4 lb Shelled walnuts (about 5
           Cups), ground
      1 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 c  Milk
      1 tb Almond extract

MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
      1 lg Egg, beaten
           Confectioners' sugar
 
  Make dough: in a large bowl, place the flour and the
  butter.  Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut the
  butter into the flour until the mixture resembles
  coarse crumbs.  Add the egg yolks and sour cream; stir
  with a fork until combined.
  
  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board or
  pastry cloth.  Knead the dough with your hands until
  it is smooth and can be shaped into a ball.  If dough
  is too sticky, knead in more flour.  If desired, wrap
  dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate.
  
  Make filling: in a medium-sized bowl, place the ground
  walnuts, granulated sugar, milk and almond extract.
  Using a wooden spoon, stir in walnut mixture until
  ingredients are thoroughly combined.  Prehead oven to
  400F. Grease baking sheets with solid vegetable
  shortening.
  
  To shape Kifli: divide the dough into quarters; wrap
  three of the quarters separately in plastic wrap and
  set aside.  On a lightly floured surface, roll out the
  remaining quarter of the dough to a 15" x 12"
  rectangle that is 1/8" thick.
  
  Using a pastry wheel, cut the rectangle of dough into
  3-inch squares. Place a heaping teaspoon of the walnut
  filling in the center of each square; bring one corner
  of the dough over the filling to the opposite corner;
  pinch edges together.
  
  Place Kifli on baking sheets; brush with the beaten
  egg.  Bake for 10 minutes or until cookies are golden
  brown.  Remove from the baking sheet. Fill the bottom
  of a pie place with confectioners' sugar.  Roll Kifli
  in the sugar.  Let cool on wire racks.  Repeat steps
  with the remaining three quarters of dough.

      Title: KILLER MARGS
 Categories: Beverages, Alcohol
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    Parts Sunkist Sweet & Sour
      1    Part GOOD tequila
      1    Part Cointreau or
           -Grand Marnier*
           Juice of 1/2 lime**
           Dash of salt
 
  *can use triple sec, but I wouldn't **3 limes for
  small-med. pitcher Pour all ingredients into shaker
  with ice and shake vigorously.
  
  Pour into tall glass with ice (can be shaken, if done
  right) and retire to the patio to watch the sunset.
  
  You can blend, but the additional ice dilutes the
  flavor, and you lose the beauty and purity of the
  margarita
  
  Fruit flavored margs must be blended if using fresh or
  frozen fruit -- fresh fruit (strawberries,
  raspberries) need LOTS of extra sugar AND the fresh
  lime juice. I haven't found any syrups that cut the
  mustard as far as flavoring "rocks" margs.
  
  I take my margaritas seriously, and would be happy to
  get into off-line discussions with anyone wishing to
  discuss further.
  
  NOTE ON TEQUILA: I like Sauza Conmemorativo, but
  Cuervo 1800 works. Exceptional tequilas like Sauza
  Tres Generaciones, Patron Anejo and other $20-$40
  bottles are wasted on margs and should be reserved for
  sipping.
  
  NOTES: I agree...a little salt here and there does
  wonderful things to many recipes (including non-food).
  In fact, one of the secrets to my TDF margaritas is
  salt IN the mixture. (I hate salt on the glass rim,
  but when you use fresh lime, the salt helps balance
  the tart citrus with the biting tequila.)  I used to
  live in New Mexico, and I cook Mexican food more than
  any other style, so I HAVE to have a great marg recipe.
  
  The other secret is Sunkist Sweet & Sour mix (which
  I've only found at one alcohol distributor open to the
  public...Beverage Warehouse, Marina del Rey).  All the
  S&S mixes on the grocery store are compltely
  inadequate, and "margarita mixes" don't have the right
  blend of flavors (oddly enough). An old friend who
  used to tend bar at a restaurant where they made
  KILLER margs enlightened me about Sunkist's mix.  I've
  since noticed it at MOST restaurants/bars that have
  great margaritas. IMHO, nothing else comes close
  (except fresh squeezed lemon and lime juice, which
  requires extra sugar and is more difficult to balance
  the flavors, but can be done and is heavenly when it
  works).

      Title: KILLER SALSA TO DIE FOR
 Categories: Ethnic, Sauces, Salsa
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    14oz tin chopped plum tomato
           Juice of two limes
      2    Habanero chilies, chopped
      2    Cl Garlic; crushed
      6    Spring onions (scallions); c
      1 ts Sugar
 
  Recipe by: chile-heads list - David Wilkinson Here's
  my favourite salsa recipe. Quick to make, and
  delicious. As with most recipes of this type, the
  quantities are variable according to personal taste,
  but this is what I like...
  
  Drain a little of the juice out of the tomatoes
  (otherwise it gets a little too runny), and then mix
  all of the ingredients together. The number of chiles
  depends very much on personal taste, and on the type
  available (here in the UK we get a much more limited
  range on sale), but I'm sure you can all figure out
  just how hot you want to make it.
  
  If possible, leave it to stand for at least half an
  hour before eating, or even overnight, but I can
  rarely wait that long before getting the munchies.
  
  How to eat: well, anyway you like. My favourite is to
  make a big bowl of salsa, take a big bag of tortilla
  chips, and then to while away the evening on the sofa
  dunking one into the other.

      1    French vanilla ice cream

  tb of sugar (or 2, if you like). Bake as directed.
  
  While still warm, cut in half and put the bottom half in a bowl.

  in the refrigerator for 2 days), add a scoop or two of French vanilla
  ice cream, and then top with the top layer of the biscuit.
  
  Now, cover with more strawberries and top with fresh whipped cream.
  Enjoy!

 Categories: Cookies, Desserts
      Yield: 32 Servings
 
           Butter; to grease the foil
     16 tb Unsalted butter; softened
      2 c  Sugar
      8 oz Bittersweet chocolate
           - melted and slightly cooled
      2 ts Vanilla extract
      4    Eggs
      1 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Chopped walnuts
      2 c  Semisweet chocolate
      2 c  Milk chocolate
      2 c  Butterscotch bits
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Line an 8 3/4-by-13 1/2-inch
  glass or metal pan with a large piece of aluminum
  foil, smoothing it into the corners. Butter the foil.
  In a large bowl, cream the butter with the sugar
  together until it is light in color. Stir in the
  melted chocolate. Add the vanilla, then add the eggs,
  beating until blended. In another bowl, combine the
  flour and salt. Add the walnuts and all the bits,
  tossing to coat them with the flour. Scrape the flour,
  nuts and bits into the bowl with the butter, and stir
  with a wooden spoon just until all the ingredients are
  mixed. Do not over-beat. Scrape the batter into the
  prepared pan, holding the foil so that it does not
  move. Place the pan in the middle of the oven and bake
  until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out
  almost clean, about 50 minutes. Remove the pan and let
  it stand for an hour, then cover the pan with foil and
  place it in your freezer for at least 1 1/2 hours or
  in your refrigerator overnight. Turn the cooled
  brownies out onto a clean workspace, lift off the foil
  and cut into 32 squares. Store in the refrigerator or
  the freezer in an airtight tin.

      Title: KIM CHEE #5
 Categories: Korean, Condiments
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2    Heads Chinese cabbage
           -OR- white cabbage
      1 c  Salt
      1 lb Daikon
      6    Green (spring) onions
      4    Garlic cloves
      1    Piece fresh gingerroot (1")
      1    Celery stalk
      1    Hard, semi-ripe pear
      4 tb Ground red pepper (cayenne)
      1 tb Granulated sugar
 
  1. Remove (do not discard) the outer leaves from the
  cabbage. Quarter the cabbage and place together with
  the outside leaves in a large bowl. Sprinkle on the
  salt. Let stand 3 hours, turning occasionally. 2. Peel
  the daikon and cut into long thin strips. Cut the
  onions into 1." strips and then shred lengthwise into
  slivers. Mix the daikon and onion strips together in
  another bowl and let sit while the cabbage and salt
  mixture is sitting. 3. Peel and mince garlic and
  gingerroot. Cut celery into 1" lengths and shred
  lengthwise. Peel, core, and slice the pear and then
  cut into long strips. Mix these ingredients together
  with the cayenne and granulated sugar and combine into
  the daikon and onion mixture. 4. The cabbage will have
  produced a brine after sitting. Remove the outer
  leaves from the brine and set aside. Take a quarter of
  the cabbage head, rinse it under running water then
  pack the daikon and onion mixture between the leaves.
  Set it in the bottom of a crock or other container.
  Repeat this procedure with the remaining three
  quarters. Any remaining mixture should be layered over
  the cabbage. Press down. 5. Place the outer leaves in
  a layer on top of the cabbage and cover the crock. Set
  a small weight on top of the cover and let sit for 3
  days. The longer it sits the stronger it gets! It can
  be stored for a month prior to opening. Keep it in a
  cool (60 degree) place. After removing the Kim Chi
  from the crock it can be stored in glass jars and used
  as needed. This is a strong recipe and if it is still
  not hot enough, diced red peppers with seeds can be
  added, to the daikon and onion mixture, but do so at
  your own risk! Enjoy.

      Title: KIM CHEE #6
 Categories: Korean, Condiments
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
    2/3 lb Napa Cabbage
    1/2 lb Daikon radish
      1 md Cucumber
      1 md Turnip
    1/2 c  Salt
      1 tb Salt
      3    Spring onions; sliced
      3    Garlic cloves; minced
      4 ts Fresh ginger, minced
      1 tb Dried chili flakes
      2 ts Soy sauce/tamari
      1 c  Water
 
  Peel daikon, cucumber and turnip, and slice 1/4"
  thick. Layer whole cabbage leaves, sliced daikon,
  cucumber and turnip in a large bowl. Between layers,
  liberally sprinkle with 1/2 cup salt. Cover with water
  and place a wide plate or pot on top to submerge them.
  Leave overnight or at least 12 hours. Drain & Rinse
  vegetables in a colander. Julienne each vegetable into
  a uniform shape. return them to the large bowl, and
  add spring onions, garlic, ginger, chili flakes,
  soy/tamari, salt and 1 cup water. Toss to combine.
  Spoon the vegetables with liquid into a large crock or
  clean jars. Cover tightly or cap. Refridgerate for 3
  days before opening. Everyday, turn jars upside down a
  couple of times to distribute spices, or stir
  vegetables in the crock. Store in refridgerator.
  Notes: Kim chee spiciness varies depending on the
  hotness of the chili flakes used. The longer it sites,
  the hotter it gets (up to a point). I cannot vouch for
  the authenticity of the recipe, but its about as close
  as I've come. beware 'kim chee' spices in oriental
  food stores, as they most likely have MSG in them.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 ts Sugar
    1/2 c  Salt
      4    Heads Garlic
      3 tb MSG Or Accent
      1 lb Carrots
      2 lg Bunches Green Onions
      1 lg Head Chinese Cabbage
      2 sm Heads Regular Cabbage
  3 1/2 tb Garlic Salt
  1 1/2 tb Paprika
      4 tb Dried Red Pepper Flakes
     20 lg Green Bell Peppers
 
  Clean the kitchen sink as this is where you will be
  working. Cut the regular cabbage into 2 to 3 inch
  pieces. Place the cabbage in the sink and add the
  salt. Work in the salt using a kneading motion, until
  the cabbage is broken up. The Chinese cabbage should
  now be cut up and added; no kneading required. Let
  this stand for 5 to 10 minutes and then rinse once or
  twice and drain well. Shred the carrots, with a potato
  peeler or a fine food processor shredder. Cut the
  green onions into 2 inch pieces, using all of the
  onions. Cut the green peppers into 1/2 inch lengths.
  Grind up the red pepper and the garlic heads in a
  blender. Blend the garlic into the mixture one clove
  at a time, using 3 to 4 heads, depending on the size
  of the heads. Mix the ground up garlic and red pepper
  mixture, paprika, garlic salt and sugar. Blend this
  mixture into the cabbage. Mix well until all of the
  Chinese cabbage is tinted red. Add small amounts of
  water as you mix to keep the cabbage moist. Taste and
  add more salt if necessary, about 1 tb at a time; add
  more garlic salt instead if more garlic is also
  needed. Add about 3/4 cup of water; press into a 1
  gallon jug, glass is best. Leave outside refrigeration
  for 48 to 72 hours. This is necessary for
  fermentation. Refrigerate after fermentation period.
  Hints: For fermentation, leave the jug in the garage
  or other place outside the house; it really smells.
  Also, don't seal the lid on the jug, it might explode.

  Sprinkle with the salt and let stand for 3 to 4 hours;
  the cabbage will wilt. Mash with the fingers until the
  cabbage is still softer, then drain off excess liquid
  and add the remaining ingredients except the sesame
  oil.
    Transfer to a large glass jar, seal and leave in a
  cool place for at least 24 hours before using.  It
  will keep for up to a week in the refrigerator.
  Sprinkle with a few drops of sesame oil before using.

      Title: KIM CHI
 Categories: Relishes, Korean
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2    Heads Chinese cabbage
           -OR- white cabbage
      1 c  Salt
      1 lb Daikon
      6    Green (spring) onions
      4    Garlic cloves
      1    Piece fresh gingerroot (1")
      1    Celery stalk
      1    Hard, semi-ripe pear
      4 tb Ground red pepper (cayenne)
      1 tb Granulated sugar
 
  1. Remove (do not discard) the outer leaves from the
  cabbage.  Quarter the cabbage and place together with
  the outside leaves in a large bowl. Sprinkle on the
  salt.  Let stand 3 hours, turning occasionally. 2.
  Peel the daikon and cut into long thin strips.  Cut
  the onions into 1." strips and then shred lengthwise
  into slivers.  Mix the daikon and onion strips
  together in another bowl and let sit while the cabbage
  and salt mixture is sitting. 3. Peel and mince garlic
  and gingerroot. Cut celery into 1" lengths and shred
  lengthwise. Peel, core, and slice the pear and then
  cut into long strips.  Mix these ingredients together
  with the cayenne and granulated sugar and combine into
  the daikon and onion mixture. 4. The cabbage will have
  produced a brine after sitting.  Remove the outer
  leaves from the brine and set aside.  Take a quarter
  of the cabbage head, rinse it under running water then
  pack the daikon and onion mixture between the leaves.
  Set it in the bottom of a crock or other container.
  Repeat this procedure with the remaining three
  quarters. Any remaining mixture should be layered over
  the cabbage.
   Press down. 5. Place the outer leaves in a layer on
  top of the cabbage and cover the crock. Set a small
  weight on top of the cover and let sit for 3 days.
  The longer it sits the stronger it gets!  It can be
  stored for a month prior to opening. Keep it in a cool
  (60 degree) place. After removing the Kim Chi from the
  crock it can be stored in glass jars and used as
  needed. This is a strong recipe and if it is still not
  hot enough, diced red peppers with seeds can be added,
  to the daikon and onion mixture, but do so at your own
  risk!

  next prime minister.)
  
  Combine shallots, salmon, wine and water in frying pan
  large enough to hold fillets in a single layer. Cover
  and bring liquid to just a simmer. Poach salmon about
  2 minutes per side. Remove and keep warm. Reserve
  stock for sauce.
  
  Sauce: In a saucepan, bring shallots, stock, wine and
  lemon juice to a boil. Cook till liquid is reduced by
  half. Strain. Cut butter into small cubes. whisk into
  mixture one piece at a time. Do not let boil. Season
  with dill, salt and pepper. Serve warm. Serve with

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Fresh Kina tongue
      1 c  Breadcrumbs
      2    Rashers Bacon
 
  Kina or sea eggs are a staple Maori food for those
  fortunate enough to live close to the sea. Kina is
  found at low tide in rock crevices and under ledges of
  rock. They should only be gathered however in summer
  when they are sweet. Maori lore says it is best for
  them to be gathered at low tide on the first, second
  and third days after a full moon. When opened the
  shell will be found to contain a mass of fine grit and
  shell, a purple membrane and five tongues which are
  red. The tongues should be scraped from the shell with
  a spoon taking care not to include any membrane or
  grit.
  
  Method: 1. Place alternate layers of kina and
  breadcrumbs, into a buttered pie dish finishing with a
  layer of breadcrumbs.
  
  2. Cover with chopped bacon.
  
  3. Bake at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes until the
  crumbs and bacon are crisp and the tongues are cooked.

  "Molasses and a tiny bit of cocoa powder gives this
  bread its rich, dark color.  This moist, dense-grained
  bread, with the texture of the popular imported
  pumpernickel you can buy in the gourmet food section
  of some stores, is perfect for slicing thinly and
  using as a base for canapes. Spread with sweet butter,
  it's also a tasty accompaniment to cheese and fruit,
  and makes a superior sandwich.  Just remember to slice
  it thinly; it's heavy, and a little goes a long way.
  Once you try this homemade pumpernickel, you'll never
  have to buy it at the supermarket again!"
  
  glaze
  
  Combine 1 1/2 cups of water with the cornmeal in a
  saucepan, and cook over low heat, stirring often, till
  thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat and
  add the molasses, butter, salt, caraway seeds and
  cocoa powder. Stir to combine and set aside to cool to
  lukewarm.
  
  Warm the remaining 1/4 cup water to approximately 110
  degrees, and stir the yeast into it.  Set aside to
  proof for 10 minutes.
  
  Put the molasses mixture in a large bowl, and add the
  yeast and mashed potatoes.  Stir in the rye flour and
  enough whole wheat flour to make a stiff, sticky
  dough.  Turn dough out onto a floured work surface,
  and knead until elastic and stiff - up to 15 minutes.
  You can do this in a mixer attached with a dough hook
  if you prefer.
  
  Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning to coat all
  sides, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside to rise
  for about 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.  Punch
  down the dough, knead for 30 seconds or so, and form
  into two smooth balls, or into loaves to fit 8 1/2 x 4
  1/2" bread pans. Grease the bread pans, or a baking
  sheet, and set loaves in pans or on sheet. Set aside
  to rise for 30 minutes or longer, till doubled in bulk.
  
  Brush loaves with egg white glaze.  Bake bread in a
  preheated 375 degree oven for 50 minutes, or until it
  tests done. Makes 2 loaves.

      Title: KING ARTHUR - MERLIN'S MAGIC SOURDOUGH BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Sourdough starter
    1/2 c  Warm water
      1 tb Active dry yeast
      3 tb Vital wheat gluten
      1 tb Salt
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      5 c  (approx.) King Arthur
           -Unbleached All-Purpose
 
  Flour
  
  Mix the starter, water, yeast and gluten together.
  Add 3 cups of the flour.  Cover with a damp towel and
  let this sponge sit overnight. The next day, add the
  salt, oil, and stir in flour until the dough is a
  shaggy mass. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured
  counter and knead the dough adding more flour as
  necessary until the dough is a smooth ball. The dough
  should not be sticky.  Place the dough in a lightly
  oiled bowl and let the dough rise for about 2 hours.
  The dough should double in size.
  
  Punch down the dough and divide it into 2 pieces.
  Knead each piece briefly on a lightly floured counter.
  Form each piece into a round ball and place on a
  baking sheet that has been greased and sprinkled with
  cornmeal. Cover the loaves with a damp towel and let
  them rise for 45 to 60 minutes or until slightly
  swollen.  While the loaves are fising, preheat the
  oven to 375 degrees.  Make 3 slashes that are about 4"
  long and 1/2" deep on the top of each loaf. This will
  help the loaves to rise evenly in the oven. Bake for
  35 minutes or until browned and the bottoms sound
  hollow when thumped.

      Title: KING ARTHUR - ONION CARAWAY SOURDOUGH BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 c  King Arthur Unbleached
           -All-Purpose Flour
      3 tb Sugar
  2 1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb (or packet) active dry yeast
      1 c  Milk
      2 tb Butter or margarine
  1 1/2 c  Sourdough starter
           Cornmeal to sprinkle on
           -baking sheet
      1    Egg white beaten with 1
           -Tbsp. water, for wash
    2/3 c  Finely chopped onion
 
  "This recipe was sent to us by Ceil Downey, of
  Framingham, Massachusetts, a long-time friend and user
  of King Arthur Flour. This recipe contains active dry
  yeast, which eliminates the need to develop a sponge.
  The onion topping adds zest."
  
  Caraway seeds to spinkle on top of loaves
  
  Making the Dough:  Combine 1 cup of the flour, the
  sugar, salt and yeast in a large bowl.  Then, combine
  the milk and butter or margarine in a saucepan.  Heat
  over low heat until liquid is very warm, 120 to 130
  degrees (the butter does not need to melt).
  
  Gradually add the liquids to the dry ingredients,
  beating well. Blend in the starter and another cup of
  flour.  Beat again. Stir in enough additional flour to
  make a soft dough.
  
  Kneading & Rising:  Turn the dough out onto a lightly
  floured board and knead until smooth and elastic,
  about 10 minutes. Then place it in a greased bowl,
  turning the dough to grease the top. Cover and let
  rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled, 1 to 2
  hours.
  
  Shaping & Rising:  Punch down the dough, turn it out
  onto a board and divide it in half (or quarters).
  Cover and let rest 15 minutes. Shape into 2 long
  loaves (or 4 small round loaves) and place on baking
  sheets that have been sprinkled with cornmeal. (For
  regular-shaped loaves, place in 2 greased 4 1/2 x 8
  1/2" bread pans.)  Cover and let the loaves rise until
  doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
  
  Baking:  About 15 minutes before you want to bake your
  bread, preheat your oven toF,XlU"puy

      Title: KING ARTHUR - SOURDOUGH BREAD WITH YEAST
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Lukewarm water
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb (or packet) active dry yeast
      1 c  Sourdough starter
  5 1/2 c  (to 6 1/2 cups) King Arthur
           -All-Purpose Flour
      1 tb Salt
      1 tb Vegetable oil
 
  "Many recipes for sourdough breads include some active
  dry yeast to spped up the process, the sourdough
  starter included mainly for flavor. We recommend
  beginning sourdough bakers start with this bread
  before moving on to the Classic Sourdough Bread which
  follows. This version makes a quicker loaf with a
  slightly different texture and taste, and is a good
  introduction to the sourdough process."
  
  cornmeal to sprinkle on baking pans
  
  Making the Sponge:  In a large mixing bowl, dissolve
  the sugar and yeast in the warm water.  Let this sit
  for 10 minutes or so until bubbly. Add the starter and
  stir. Gradually add 3 cups of flour, stirring until
  well mixed and smooth.
  
  Cover this sponge and set it aside in a warm,
  draft-free place for 4 to 5 hours.
  
  Making the Dough:  Stir down the sponge.  Stir in 1
  cup of flour, the salt and oil.  Gradually add flour
  until the dough no longer sticks to the sides of the
  bowl.
  
  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and
  knead for 3 to 4 minutes.  Let the dough rest while
  you clean and grease your bowl. Continue kneading
  another 3 or 4 minutes or until the dough is smooth
  and elastic. Add only enough flour to the board to
  keep the dough from sticking. Place dough in the
  greased bowl and let rise until doubled in bulk, 1 to
        2    hours.
  
  Shaping & Baking:  Knock down the dough and shape it
  into two long French- or Italian-style loaves.  Place
  them on a cornmeal-sprinkled baking sheet and let them
  rise for another 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
  
  Toward the end of the rising period, place a baking
  pan on the oven bottom (or on the lowest rack) and
  preheat your oven to 450 degrees.
  
  Just before baking, slash the tops diagonally every
  couple of inches, about 1/4" deep, and brush with cold
  water.
  
  Pour 2 or 3 cups of water into the pan, put the loaves
  on the rack above the steaming water, and bake for
  about 25 minutes.
  
  The crust will be very hard when you remove the bread,
  but in 5 minutes it will be soft and chewy.  To make
  the crust crisp and chewy, turn the oven off and leave
  the bread inside for an additional 5 minutes.

      Title: KING ARTHUR FLOUR - BAKING TIPS
 Categories: Information, Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -DEBBIE CARLSON   (PHHW01A)
           -KING ARTHUR FLOUR HINTS
 
  1.  Yeast Proofing:  To "proof" yeast, first dissolve
  the
    sugar (about 1 Tbsp. for each 2 cups liquid) or other
    sweetener in warm water (about 95 degrees) and then
  add
    your yeast.  Wait several minutes for it to dissolve
    and begin to "work", or develop tiny bubbles.  If it
    doesn't show signs of life, discard it and try
  another
    batch.  Because yeast doesn't like salt, add it after
    the yeast is "proofed".
  
  2.  A Better Measure:  Because flour settles and
  compacts
    in storage, fluff it up before you measure.  Then,
    gently sprinkle it into your measuring cup and scrape
    the excess off with the back of a knife.  This will
    insure a 4 oz. cup of flour rather than the 5 oz. you
    would have if you scooped it out with your cup. 3.
  Rest When You "Knead" It!:  After 3 or 4 minutes of
    kneading dough, let it rest for a few minutes.  The
    rest relaxes the dough and makes the remaining
  kneading
    easier.
  
  4.  Liquid Assets:  Instead of the water your recipe
  calls
    for, try juices, bouillon, or water you've cooked
    vegetables in.  Instead of milk, try buttermilk,
    yogurt, or sour cream.  It can add a whole new flavor
    and improve nutrition.
  
  5.  Sweeteners:  Even though you don't need it when
  making
    bread, a little sugar can bring out flavor, just as
    salt can.  For added moisture, try honey, maple
  syrup,
    or regular or dark unsulphured molasses.
  
  6.  Oil for Longevity:  If you don't mind a few extra
    calories (12 to 15) per slice (a slice of bread
  without
    fat has only 60 to 65 calories!), add a couple of
    tablespoons of butter or vegetable oil to your dough,
    and your bread will stay fresher for a longer
  period. 7. Storing King Arthur Flour:  If you use your
  flour
    fairly quickly, store it in a cool, dry cupboard and
    stick a couple of bay leaves in the bag to discourage
    any visitors.  If you use your flour more slowly,
    especially your whole wheat, put it in a lock-type
    plastic bag and store it in your freezer. 06/30

      Title: KING ARTHUR FLOUR - SOURDOUGH STARTER TIPS 1
 Categories: Information, Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -DEBBIE CARLSON   (PHHW01A)
           -KING ARTHUR FLOUR HINTS
 
  The following information comes from King Arthur Flour
  "A Short Course in Cooking With & Keeping the Elusive
  Wild Yeast".
  
  What is a Sourdough Starter? "A sourdough starter is a
  wild yeast living in a batter of flour and liquid.
  Yeasts are microscopic fungi related distantly to
  mushrooms. There are many varieties of these tiny
  organisms around us everywhere. Wild yeasts are rugged
  individualists which can withstand the most extreme of
  circumstances. Some will make delicious loaves of
  bread; others will create yogurt and cheese out of
  milk; still others will turn the juices of grains and
  fruit into beer and wine." "Active dry yeast, the kind
  we can buy in packets at our grocer's, is a
  domesticated descendant of these wild relatives, one
  which has been grown for flavor, speed of growth and
  predictability. But domestic yeasts are much more
  fragile and can't be grown at home without eventually
  reverting to their original wild state."
  
  "If you can imagine a world without any packets of
  active dry yeast, you can imagine how important your
  sourdough starter would be to you. Without it, you
  would be doomed to some pretty awful eating. It is no
  wonder that sourdough starters were treasured, fought
  over, and carried to all ends of the earth.  To the
  early prospectors, it was such a valued possession
  (almost more than the gold they were seeking), that
  they slept with it on frigid winter nights to keep it
  from freezing. (Ironically, freezing won't kill a
  sourdough starter although too much heat will.)"
  
  Fermentation (or the Microscopic Magic of Yeast): "As
  we mentioned above, yeast is a microscopic fungus.  As
  it feeds on the natural sugars in grain, it multiplies
  and gives off carbon dioxide (just as we do when we
  breathe). This invisible activity of yeast is called
  fermentation. When you make bread with wheat, by
  kneading the long elastic strands of wheat protein
  (called gluten) into an elastic mesh, you create traps
  for these carbon dioxide bubbles causing the dough to
  expand as if it contained a million tiny balloons."

           -KING ARTHUR FLOUR HINTS
 
  (Continued) How to Feed & Care for Your Sourdough
  Starter:
  
  "Keeping a sourdough starter is somewhat like having a
  pet because it needs to be fed and cared for.  But its
  requirements are simple and not time consuming. Baking
  with sourdough is also a simple process. All it takes
  is a little planning and timing. The results are so
  satisfying, you'll grow to treasure your invisible pet
  the way our ancestors did."
  
  "When you receive your starter, refrigerate it if you
  don't intend to feed it immediately (at any rate,
  starter should be fed as soon as possible after you
  receive it). To feed it for the first time, snip off a
  corner of the plastic bag and squeeze the starter into
  a glass or ceramic bowl (not metal).  Stir in 3 cups
  of lukewarm water (what feels comfortable on your
  wrist) and 3 cups of unbleached all-purpose flour. Mix
  until it's well blended and the consistency of pancake
  batter. Let the replenished starter sit at room
  temperature for at least 12 hours to give the yeast a
  chance to multiply and become active before you put it
  in the refrigerator. Ordinarily you would feed your
  starter when you remove some to bake with it.  A good
  rule of thumb is to replenish it every two weeks or
  so, preferably because you made a wonderful loaf of
  sourdough bread, a stack of pancakes or a delicious
  sourdough cake." (This previous paragraph is for those
  people who have ordered King Arthur's Sourdough
  Starter from their catalog.)
  
  "During the time the starter is stored in the
  refrigerator, it becomes relatively dormant which is
  why it can survive so long with so little attention.
  You'll find that a clear, amber colored liquid will
  accumulate on the surface of the starter. This liquid
  contains 12% to 14% alcohol."
  
  "When yeast is in contact with air, it produces carbon
  dioxide; when it's not, it produces alcohol.  When you
  blend the alcohol back into the starter, it helps
  produce the unique flavor you find in good sourdough
  breads.  For milder flavor, you can pour off some of
  the alcohol if you wish although this will thicken the
  starter requiring a bit more liquid to return it to
  its "pancake batter" consistency. (To "sweeten" a
  starter in another way, see Troubleshooting which
  follows.) The alcohol itself dissipates during the
  baking process." (Continued)

  (CONTINUED) Storing Your Starter:
  
  "Once your sourdough pet is cold and relatively
  dormant, it can survive quite a long time between
  "feedings." It is certainly not as demanding as
  children, or more traditional pets, but it isn't happy
  just sitting for months on end like a packet of
  commercially dried yeast either." "Freezing: You may
  be able to ignore your starter for a month or even
  much longer, but if you know you're going to be away
  for a time, you can store it (unlike children or pets)
  in the freezer. You may want to transfer it to a
  plastic container first as it will expand as it
  freezes. When you are ready to use it again, give it a
  day to revive, feed it a good meal, give it another
  day to build up an armada of fresh, new wild siblings
  and it will be ready to go to work."
  
  "Drying:  An alternative storage method is to dry your
  starter by spreading it out on a piece of heavy
  plastic wrap or waxed paper. Once it's dry, crumble it
  up and put it in an airtight container. Store it some
  place cool, or, to be safe, in the freezer. To
  reactivate the dried starter, grind it into small
  particles with a hand cranked grinder, a blender or a
  food processor.  Pour 1 to 1 1/2 cups of warm water
  (what feels comfortable on your wrist) into a glass or
  ceramic bowl. Stir in and dissolve a tablespoon of
  sugar or honey. This isn't necessary but it gives the
  yeast an easy "first course."  Blend in an equal
  amount of flour and dried starter.  Cover the bowl
  with plastic wrap and watch for small telltale bubbles
  which should begin to appear on the surface within a
  few hours. Once you see them you'll know it's alive
  and well. Let it continue to feed and grow for a
  further 12 hours before you cover and refrigerate it."
  How to Remove Some Starter for Baking:
  
  "With a spoon or wire whisk, blend the liquid back
  into the starter and then measure out the quantity
  required by your recipe. Replace the amount taken with
  equal amounts of flour and water. Since many recipes
  are based on using 1 cup of starter, you would return
  to your starter pot, 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of
  water. (This actually makes 1 1/3 cups more starter
  but you can adjust the amount whenever you want.) As
  you did when you first fed your starter, let it sit at
  room temperature for at least 12 hours to give the
  yeast a chance to "feed" and multiply before you chill
  it again."

  (CONTINUED) TROUGLESHOOTING
  
  Feeding Without Baking:  "If you have been busy or
  away, you can always feed your starter without baking
  anything. Stir the mixture together, take out and
  discard 1 cup of starter and replenish as above,
  stirring in 1 cup water and 1 cup flour. (Or instead
  of discarding the starter you removed, ask a neighbor
  if he or she would be interested in adopting a starter
  of his/her very own.)  Let the resuscitated mixture
  sit at room temperature for 12 hours or so before you
  return it to the refrigerator."
  
  Treating a "Sluggish" Starter:  "If you feel that your
  starter is just not "up to snuff," dissolve a teaspoon
  of yeast in the cup of water you mix into the starter
  when you feed it. (If you live in an area where water
  is chlorinated, let some sit out overnight to allow
  the chlorine to dissipate to preclude any interference
  with the development of the sourdough
  micro-organisms)."
  
  Sweetening a Starter:  "If your starter becomes too
  sour, take out 1 cup, dispose of the remainder, and
  add 2 cups of each of flour and water to refreshen it."
  
  Increasing Your Starter:  "If you want to grow a large
  amount of starter to give some to a friend or to do a
  lot of baking, simply increase the amount you feed it."
  
  Resuscitating a Neglected Starter:  "If your sourdough
  starter has sat in the refrigerator months beyond the
  point of health, give it a fighting chance for
  survival before you throw it out. A little warmth and
  a good meal of strong, high energy carbohydrates may
  be all it needs to get it off and running again."
  
  "The layer of liquid on the surface will probably be
  very dark, making it look as if the starter must
  surely have expired. Quell your fear, wrestle the top
  off the jar and give it a sniff. If it smells the way
  it should, though exceptionally sour, it may just be
  sitting there in a dormant state waiting to be fed.
  The only way to know is to give it a meal."
  
  "Blend it back together and pour it into a glass or
  ceramic bowl. (Take this opportunity to give its jar a
  good wash.) As the starter will probably be quite
  thin, mix in 2 cups of flour and 1 cup of water to
  nourish and thicken it. Leave the bowl out on the
  counter where it will be warm and visible." (Continued)

  (CONTINUED) "In a couple of hours you may see tiny
  bubbles appear on the surface.  If so, cheer your brew
  on by keeping it warm and covered overnight.  In the
  morning, celebrate by making sourdough pancakes (which
  you'll find ...in our "King Arthur
  
  Flour 200th Anniversary Cookbook").  They are
  delicious and quick. Give the remaining starter
  another feeding, let it sit for 12 more hours to
  ensure its reawakened vigor before you tuck it back in
  the frig. Then quietly heave a sigh of relief and
  congratulate yourself on your rescue." How to Decide
  if You Need to Start Over (groan):
  
  "If your sourdough begins to mold or develop a
  peculiar color or odor instead of a "clean, sour
  aroma," give a sigh, throw it out and, if you're
  patient, start again. Along with the vital yeasts, you
  may have inadvertently nurtured a strain of bacteria
  that will not be wonderful in food.  This happens very
  infrequently so don't let this possibility dissuade
  you from a sourdough adventure."
  
  Starter Variations:
  
  "Here are some variations on the basic
  flour/liquid/yeast combination that will produce
  sourdough starters with different personalities.
  
  *Substitute 1 cup of stone ground whole wheat flour
  for 1 of the unbleached all-purpose flour.
  
  *For tap water, substitute water from cooking potatoes.
   It contains nutrients which any kind of yeast loves
  and along with making the yeast happy, it creates
  great flavor in bread.
  
  *Substitute buttermilk for tap water.

           -DEBBIE CARLSON   (PHHW01A)
           -KING ARTHUR FLOUR HINTS
 
  "One of the most frequently asked questions of us here
  at King Arthur Flour is, 'What is gluten?'  Gluten is
  an element of the wheat berry that contains two
  special proteins, gluten in and gliadin. When you are
  making bread, and you add liquid to the flour, you get
  these two proteins in business.  They start to
  interact and form a web which traps the carbon dioxide
  that the yeast is giving off. This web is developed
  during the kneading process.  Wheat is the only grain
  which contains gluten."
  
  "To use gluten, we have found that adding a tablespoon
  for each cup of flour called for in the recipe will
  increase the rise in the bread from 25% to 30%.  The
  proper way to measure the gluten is to put 1
  tablespoon of the gluten in your measuring cup and
  then spoon the flour into the cup on top of the
  gluten. Level off the flour with the back of a knife."

      Title: KING ARTHUR'S EGG BRAID
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 tb Active dry yeast
      1 c  Warm water
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Warm milk
      4    Eggs, room temperature
      1    Stick butter or margarine
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 tb Cinnamon
      7 c  7-9 cups King Arthur
           -unbleached all-purpose
           -flour
     12    Dyed uncooked eggs

MMMMM--------------------------EGG WASH-------------------------------
      1    Egg, beaten
      1 tb Water
           Pinch of salt
 
  Dissolve the yeast in the water. Stir in the sugar and
  add 1/2 cup flour. Let this sit for 10-minutes to give
  the yeast a chance to get going. Add the milk, eggs,
  butter, salt, and cinnamon. Stir in 4 cups of the
  flour. Add more flour until the dough starts to form a
  shaggy mass. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured
  counter and knead it, adding more flour as necessary,
  until the dough has formed a smooth and satiny ball.
  The dough will be a little tacky, but it shouldn't be
  sticky. Put the dough into a clean bowl and coat it
  with a little melted butter. This will help prevent
  the formation of a skin on the dough due to exposure
  to the air. Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a
  damp towel. Let the dough rise in a warm spot for 1
  1/2 to 2 hours, or until it's quite swollen and puffy
  looking. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured
  counter and knead it gently to expel any air bubbles.
  You don't need to actively knead the dough at this
  point; that will excite the gluten in the dough and
  make it harder to braid the bread. Divide the dough
  into 2 pieces and set one aside. Divide the first
  piece into 3 even pieces. Roll each piece into a rope
  that is 1" in diameter. Braid the set of ropes and
  shape the braid into a large circle. Place the circle
  on a greased or parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
  Repeat with the second piece of dough. Cover the
  loaves with damp towels and let the wreaths rise for
  30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place the
  eggs on the wreaths and gently press them into the
  dough. Brush the dough with the egg wash (1 egg beaten
  with 1 tbs. water and a pinch of salt). Bake the
  loaves for 35-45 minutes, until nicely browned.
  Occasionally an egg will split in the oven. Use a
  sharp knife to remove it from the wreath and
  substitute a dyed-hard-boiled egg. Cool the wreaths on
  a rack and ice when fully cool. Makes 2 wreaths, each
  yielding 12 large slices. Icing glaze: 1 1/2 cups
  confectioners' sugar 3 tbs orange liqueur Beat the
  sugar and the liqueur together. The icing should be
  the consistency of a thick salad dressing. Use a fork
  to drizzle the icing on the wreaths.

      Title: KING ARTHUR'S FRENCH APPLE PIE
 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
      1 c  King Arthur unbleached all-
           Purpose flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Solid vegetable shortening
      1 tb Ice water

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      8 c  Apples, peeled, cored and
           -sliced*
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar
    1/4 c  King Arthur unbleached all-
           -purpose flour
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Nutmet

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
      1 c  King Arthur unbleached all-
           -purpose flour
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
    1/2 c  Firm butter
 
  CRUST: Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Put the flour and
  salt in a bowl big enough to work in half the
  shortening with your pastry blender. Put the remaining
  shortening in the blend till it looks mixed, but
  lumpy. It's okay to handle the mix at this point, but
  once you start to add the ice water, overhandling will
  make the crust tough, so try to keep handling to a
  minimum. The water should be ice cold and added
  gradually, mixing a little with a spoon after each
  addition. When dough starts to hold together a bit you
  can grab hold of it with your hands to form it into a
  ball. Be sure to use plenty of flour on your hands and
  on the wooden board, where you'll roll it out.
  Transfer the dough to a floured board. Roll the dough
  as thinly and evenly as possible. Transfer dough to
  pie pan. FILLING: *Recommended apples: Paula Reds are
  first choice, or Cortlands Once the apples are
  processed they can be mixed with the other
  ingredients. If the apples aren't very juicy, you may
  want to cut back on the amount of flour a little. Add
  cinnamon and nutmeg. TOPPING: Cut the butter with a
  knife then mix it with the other ingredients. Mixture
  should be a little lumpy. Spread evenly over the top
  of the apples. Bake pie in a preheated 425 degree oven
  for 15 minutes. then reduce heat to 350 and bake for
  an additional 30 minutes.

      Title: KING CAKE
 Categories: Cajun, Cakes
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
           -New Orleans CB
           Dough of your choice for
           -1 large coffee cake
           -(approximate proportions:
      2 oz Fresh compressed yeast
           Or
      4 pk Active dry yeast
      4 c  =TO=
      5 c  Flour
      1 c  Lukewarm scalded milk
    3/4 c  Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      5    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla extract
    3/4 c  Salted butter)
           --For recipe
      1    Dried bean or tiny (3/4"
           -long) china baby doll
      1 c  Sugar
      5    Or more small bottles of
           -assorted food coloring
      1 c  Candied fruit
           -(preferably small
           -pieces)*
 
   After mixing the dough (addint the bean or doll now,
  if desired) and letting it rise, shape it into an oval
  ring, following the description given abaove for the
  approximate dimensions**. Sprinkle the top of the cake
  evenly with sugar and make swirls with food coloring
  all over the top, with the swirl of one color slightly
  overlapping the next. Imbed the the pieces of candied
  fruit in the top of the cake, con- centrating most of
  them in a band about 1-1/4" wide all the way around.
  Set the cake on a baking sheet and bake according to
  instructions in the recipe you use. The finished cake
  should be lightly browned wherever the dough shows
  through; the parts covered with colored sugar should
  appear slightly crust.
  
   * The cakes that you purchase in the local bakeries
  do not have the fruit on them.
  
   **Dimensions-Shape-an oval ring about 2-1/2" thick
  and about 3" high at the highest point; and the
  decoration, as elaborate and colorful as possible in
  order to make the cake look like a jeweled crown. As
  for the bean or doll, it can be baked into the batter
  or pushed into the finished cake from underneath-just
  so long as it's done secretly, so no one knows in
  advance which slice will designate the monarch for the
  week.

      Yield: 10 Servings
 
           KING CAKE, BATON ROUGE CAJUN
 
  2 pkg. yeast 1/2 c. lukewarm water 1/2 t. sugar 1 c.
  scalded milk 1/2 stick good margarine 3/8 c. sugar 2
  t. salt 1 egg 5-6 c. flour Scald milk and add melted
  margarine. LET COOL. Soften yeast in water, add 1/2 t.
  sugar to yeast.  Let sit 30 seconds to activate yeast.
  Add yeast mixture, eggs, sugar and salt to COOLED
  milk.  Add flour a little at at time until you have a
  thick dough. Let rest 10 minutes, knead 20 minutes.
  Divide dough into two portions. Roll one portion out
  into a rectangle until dough is approx. 1/2 in. thick.
  Spread softened butter onto dough. Sprinkle with a
  mixture of 3/4 c. sugar and 2 t. cinnamon. Roll dough
  up starting at widest end and them form a circle and
  squeeze together at opening ends of circle. Carefully
  place on cookie sheet. Let rise till double and bake
  350 deg. oven for 20-25 min. Make confectioner sugar
  thin icing and divide into three bowls.  Color each
  icing bowl, purple, green and yellow. If you have a
  plastic baby doll put it inside the bake cake.If not,
  some true Cajuns add a red bean inside the cake.
  FROST the cake with the three different colors. Now I
  sometimes make a cream cheese filling. Simply mix
  soften cream cheese (16 oz) with 1 c. confectioner
  sugar and 1 t. almond extract. Instead of the
  butter/cinnamon sugar filling, I put this cream cheese
  filling.  IT IS VERY VERY GOOD. Here in Louisiana,it
  is traditional that whoever get the baby or bean when
  served the cake has to bring the cake to the next
  party or office coffee shop. LAISSEZ LES BON TEMPS

 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1    Onion, chopped
      2    Celery ribs, chopped
    1/4 c  Butter
      3 tb Flour, all purpose
      2 qt Chicken stock
      2 c  Peanut butter, smooth
  1 3/4 c  Light cream
      1    Peanuts, chopped
 
  Servings: 12
  
  Saute onion and celery in butter until soft, but not
  brown. Stir in flour until well blended. Add chick
  stock, stirring constantly, and bring to a boil.
  Remove from heat and rub through a sieve. Add peanut
  butter and cream, stirring to blend thoroughly. Return
  to low heat, but do not boil, and serve, garnished
  with peanuts.
  
  Note: This soup is also good served ice cold.
  
  This is as served at the King's Arms Tavern in
  Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia.
  
  "Peanuts (ground nuts) are from Brazil that sailed
  with the Portuguese explorers to Africa and back to
  the Americas with the Negro. In 1794, Thomas Jefferson
  recorded the yield of sixty-five peanut hills at
  Monticello.  The cultivation of peanuts increased in
  the South in the nineteenth century, but it was not
  until after the Civil War that they gained national
  acceptance."

MMMMM-----------------------MOP (OPTIONAL----------------------------
           Remaining rub
      1 c  Cider vinegar
    1/4 c  Oil (canola or corn)
 
  *butterflied tail section; or use coho or silver salmon
  
  1. The night before you plan to barbecue, combine the
  rub ingredients in a small bowl. Open the salmon flat
  and massage it well with about 2/3 of the rub,
  reserving the rest of the mixture. Fold the salmon
  back into its original shape, place it in a plastic
  bag, and refrigerate it overnight.
  
  2. Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the
  temperature to 180' to 200' F.
  
  3. Remove the salmon from the refrigerator and let it
  sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.
  
  4. If you plan to baste the fish, stir the remaining
  rub together with the other mop ingredients in a small
  saucepan and warm the mixture over low heat.
  
  5. Transfer the salmon to the smoker skin side down,
  placing the fish as far from the fire as possible.
  Cook for 50 to 60 minutes, mopping it after 10 and 30
  minutes in a wood-burning pit, or as appropriate for
  your style of smoker. The salmon should flake easily
  when done. Have a large spatula and a platter ready
  when taking the salmon off the smoker, because it can
  fall apart easily. Serve hot or chilled.
  
  BBQ Tips: Alder remains the best wood for smoking
  Pacific salmon. Alder chips are fairly common across
  the country, but you may have more difficulty finding
  the wood in chunks or logs. Fruit woods are the best
  substitute, particularly when mixed with smaller
  pieces of alder.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------KLINGON PIGS FEET & PEA SOUP---------------------
  2 1/2 lb Fresh pigs feet
           -or pork hocks
           -salt
      1 lb Yellow split peas
      1    Onion; chopped
      2 qt Water
           -butter
 
   The night before you plan to make this soup, soak the
  feet or hocks in brine (1 tablespoon of salt per quart
  of water). They should be completely covered. Put the
  split peas to soak in plain cool water. There should
  be about 2 inches of water over the peas--they will
  swell quite a bit. The meat should be put in the
  refrigeratior overnight; the peas may be, too, but it
  is less important.
   In the morning, take the meat out of the brine, put
  it in a 8 qt. pot, add the peas, onion and 2 quarts of
  fresh water. Bring to a boil. Skim off any foam that
  comes to the top, then reduce the heat and simmer for
  about 6 or more hours, stirring occasionally so the
  peas do not stick to the bottom of the pot. The meat
  should be fallng off the bones, and the soup should be
  quite thick and fairly smooth.
   Take the meat and bones out of the soup and cool
  slightly. Take the meat off the bones and cut into
  smaller pieces. Put the meat back into the soup and
  reheat if necessary. Serve with a small pat of butter
  in the center of each bowl.

      4    Egg whites
      1 lb Confectioners sugar
      1 ts Lemon juice
    3/4 lb Walnuts,broken into quarters
 
   If you have egg whites left over from other recipes,
  use them for making kisses. For the holidays you can
  dress them up by sprinkling some green sugar or red
  cinnamon hearts on each kiss to make them more festive.
  
   Preheat oven to 250.
  
   In a large bowl, beat egg whites until stiff; add
  sugar and lemon juice. Continue beating on high speed
  until mixture is very stiff (this takes a few
  minutes). Stir in nuts.
  
   With a teaspoon, place small mounds on a greased and
  floured cookie sheet. Bake at 250 for about 30
  minutes. Kisses should be set, but not brown.
  
  Variation: Substitute chocolate chips for walnuts.

      Title: KIT'S CHOCOLATE MOUSSE
 Categories: Desserts, Chocolate
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
     18 oz Semisweet chocolate
      2 c  Heavy cream; well chilled
      6 ea Egg
      2 tb Confectioner's sugar
      2 tb Creme de cacao
      1 tb Vanilla extract
 
  1.  Melt the chocolate over hot water. Let it cool
  until only warm. 2.
   While the chocolate cools, whip the cream until it
  forms medium-stiff peaks. Do not overbeat or the
  mousse will lose some of its smooth, light texture. 3.
  Separate 4 of the eggs and set the whites aside.
  Combine yolks with the 2 remaining whole eggs in the
  bowl of an electric mixer. Beat until eggs are thick
  and lemon colored, around 5 minutes. While the yolks
  are beating, place the 4 egg whites in a clean copper
  or stainless steel bowl and whisk, preferably by hand,
  until the whites start to stiffen. Sprinkle on the
  confectioners' sugar and beat until you have firm
  peaks. 4.  Working quickly, add the cooled melted
  chocolate and a scoop of the whipped cream to the egg
  yolks. Stir until smooth, then add the remaining
  cream. When it is fully incorporated, add the liqueur
  and vanilla, then fold in the whites until just
  blended. 5.  This mousse can be poured into small
  individual serving dishes or into 1 larger dessert
  dish. Chill at least 4 hours before serving. (Chilling
  it overnight intensifies the flavor.) The mousse may
  be frozen for up to 2 weeks. Remove from the freezer
  and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight before
  serving. VARIATION: Make a Brownie Cookie Crust from
  the Brownie Cookies recipe, then fill it with the
  mousse. Chill for 4 hours, then pipe whipped cream on
  top.

 Categories: Gifts, Holidays, Spices
      Yield: 14 Servings
 
      1    Serving
      1 tb Garlic powder
      1 ts Ground basil
      1 ts Ground thyme
      1 ts Ground parsley
      1 ts Ground savory
      1 ts Ground mace
      1 ts Ground sage
      1 ts Onion powder
      1 ts Ground black pepper
    1/2 ts Cayenne
           Makes about 1/4 cup.
 
  Sorry to be sending these so late but I remember
  several people talking about making gift baskets of
  homemade goodies for Xmas. Thought the following spice
  recipes might be good inclusions to such a gift.
  
  I will be using baby food jars for storing and sending
  these for gifts.
  
  AHA Herb Mix Marinade
  
  Combine the ingredients and store the herb mix in a
  spice jar.  If you are using herbs in leaf form,
  combine all the ingredients, and process them in a
  blender until they are ground.
  
  This no-salt seasoning mix is from the American Heart
  Association.
  
  Use this mixture in a Turkey Meatball Stroganoff, with
  anything in a yogurt sauce, in beef stew, in place of
  poultry seasoning, for examples.
  
  This can be made in large quantities and stored in
  airtight spice jars. If you start with herbs that are
  in leaf form, use 1 1/2 tsp each of basil, parsley and
  sage, and 1 1/4 tsp of thyme and savory.

  on shellfish, in pasta dishes, or on baked potatoes.

      Title: KITCHEN HINTS
 Categories: Info/tips, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Info
 
           No Ingredients Found
 
  I thought I'd pass along some hints to help those of
  us that get into trouble from time to time.  It's not
  recipes, but what the heck!
  
  If you've over-salted soup or vegetables, add cut raw
  potatoes and then discard once they have cooked and
  absorbed the salt.
  
  A teaspoon each of cider vinegar and sugar added to
  salty soup or vegetables will also remedy the salty
  situation.
  
  If you've over-sweetened a dish, add salt.
  
  A teaspoon of cider vinegar will take care of
  too-sweet main dishes or vegetables.
  
  Pale gravy may be browned by adding a bit of instant
  coffee straight from the jar.  No bitter taste, either.
  
  If you will brown the flour well before adding to the
  liquid when making gravy, you will avoid pale or lumpy
  gravy.
  
  If time allows, the best method of removing fat is
  refrigeration until the fat hardens.  If you put a
  piece of waxed paper over the top of the meal, it can
  be peeled right off, along with the hardened fat. Ice
  cubes will also eliminate the fat from soup and stew.
  Just drop a few into the pot and stir; the fat will
  cling to the cubes; discard the cubes before they
  melt.  Or, wrap ice cubes in paper towel or
  cheesecloth and skim over the top.
  
  A slice of soft bread placed in the package of
  hardened brown sugar will soften it again in a couple
  of hours.
  
  A little salt placed in a frying pan will prevent
  splattering.
  
  Meat Loaf will not stick if you place a slice of bacon
  on the bottom of the pan.
  
  Vinegar brought to a boil in a new frying pan will
  prevent foods from sticking.
  
  No sticking to the pan when you're scalding milk if
  you'll first rinse the pan in cold water.
  
  A lump of butter or a few teaspoons of cooking oil
  added to water when boiling rice, noodles, macaroni,
  or spaghetti will prevent boiling over.
  
  A few drops of lemon juice added to simmering rice
  will keep the grains separate.
  
  A dampened paper towel or terry cloth brushed downward
  on a cob of corn will remove every strand of corn silk.
  
  To determine if an egg is fresh, immerse it in a pan
  of cool, salted water. If it sinks, it is fresh; it it
  rises to the surface, throw it away.
  
  Fresh eggs' shells are rough and chalky; old eggs are
  smooth and shiny.
  
  To determine if an egg is hard-boiled, spin it.  If it
  spins, it is hard-boiled.  If it wobbles, it is raw.
  
  Egg shells can be easily removed from hard-boiled eggs
  if they are boiled in salty water and quickly rinsed
  in cold water.
  
  No "curly" bacon for breakfast when you dip it into
  cold water before frying.
  
  Keep bacon slices from sticking together; roll the
  package into a tube shape and secure with rubber bands.

 Categories: Middle east, Turkish, Vegetables, Eggplant, Time/life
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 tb Olive oil
  1 1/2 c  Olive oil
      4 md Tomato; peeled, seeded and
           ;coarsely chopped
      2 lg Garlic cloves; peeled and
           ;thinly sliced
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Salt
      1    Eggplant; (about 1 lb.)
      2 md Green peppers; seeded,
           ;deribbed and cut lengthwise
           ;into quarters
 
  Name; Fried Eggplant with Green Peppers and Tomato
  Sauce
  
    In a heavy 8 to 10 inch skillet, heat 2 tablespoons
  of the olive oil over moderate heat until a light haze
  forms above it.  Add the tomatoes, garlic and 1
  teaspoon of the salt.  Mashing and stirring
  frequently, cook the tomatoes briskly until almost all
  their liquid evaporates and they become a thick,
  somewhat smooth puree.  Set aside off the heat.
    With a large, sharp knife, peel the eggplant and cut
  off the stem end. Cut the eggplant lengthwise into
  inch thick slices.  Then one at a time lay each slice
  flat and cut lengthwise strips at  inch intervals
  starting at the wide end and cutting to within about 2
  inches of the narrow end. the slices should now look
  like fans. Combine 1 quart of water and the remaining
  1/4 cup of salt in a shallow bowl or baking dish, and
  add the eggplant sections.  Turn them about to coat
  them evenly with the brine, and let them soak at room
  temperature for about 10 minutes to rid them of any
  bitterness.
    In a heavy 12 inch skillet, heat the remaining 1
  cups of oil over high heat until a light haze forms
  above it.  Pat the eggplant completely dry with paper
  towels.  Regulating the heat so the eggplant colors
  evenly without burning, fry it 3 or 4 slices at a time
  for about 5 minutes on each side, or until it is
  lightly browned and shows no resistance when pierced
  with the tines of a fork. Transfer the eggplant to
  paper towels and fry the remaining slices.
    Add the green peppers, skin side up, to the oil
  remaining in the skillet, adding more oil if
  necessary.  Cook the peppers over moderate heat for
  about 10 minutes, turning them over with tongs. When
  they are soft but still somewhat firm to the touch,
  drain them on paper towels. Peel off the skins with a
  small, sharp knife.
    Mound the eggplant slices in the center of a serving
  platter and pour the tomato sauce over them.  Fold the
  peppers in half lengthwise and arrange them
  attractively around the eggplant.  Serve at room
  temperature.

  Now watch this sleight of culinary hand as I
  effortlessly slip across national boundaries and
  across hemispheres to inextricably link the cuisines
  of Denmark and Mexico.
  
  Klipfish is salted dried cod, and Danish klipfish is
  so good that large quantities of it are exported to
  Spain, where "bacalao", as it is called there, is much
  appreciated.
  
  Cut 2 lbs. of fish in pieces and soak for 24 hours in
  lukewarm water (or milk, if desired) with a teaspoon
  of soda.  Take up the fish, cut off the fins, and
  scrape the skin.  Put over the fire in cold water
  without salt and cook for half an hour until quite
  tender.
  
  Serve on a hot platter garnished with parsley and with
  boiled potatoes, melted butter, mustard sauce and a
  dish of diced, hard boiled eggs (figure one egg per
  person).

      6    Egg; hard-boiled, peeled
           Margarine
 
  Mix all the ingredients except the hard-boiled eggs
  and the margarine. Put half the mixture into a
  well-greased loaf pan (I found that I didn't need to
  oil the pan), then put the whole hard-boiled eggs in a
  row down the middle of the meat and cover with the
  remaining meat mixture.  Dab the top with margarine as
  desired:  a lot if the meat is lean, very little if it
  is fat.  Bake for 15 minutes in a 500 F. oven, then
  reduce the heat to 350 F. for about 45 minutes, until
  brown on top.  Serve warm or cold in thick slices so
  the egg centers each piece.

           To describe it, but
           It's more than that.
           Pronounced--KAH--NISH
 
  1/3 c egg whites (about 2) 2 Tbsp oil + 1/4 tsp salt
  3/4 c water 3 c flour Oil Vegetable Filling and/or
  Potato filling 1 egg, beaten (for wash)
  
  Combine egg whites, oil, salt, water, and flour and
  beat with an electric mixer until smooth.  Pour a thin
  layer of oil over dough. Let stand at room temperature
  for 1 hour.
  
  Prepare filling as directed.  Preheat oven to 350
  degrees. On a heavily floured board, kneed dough until
  smooth and elastic. Roll out to a 1/8 inch thickness,
  shaping into a 14 X 24 inch oblong. Brush dough with
  oil. Spoon potato filling along one 24" edge of the
  dough. Spoon vegetable filling along the other 24"
  edge. Roll the dough over the filling and continue
  rolling toward the center. Then roll the other side
  towards the center. Cut each long roll into 2 pieces.
  Place all 4 pieces on a heavily greased cookie sheet.
  Brush with oil and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until
  golden brown. Remove from oven and brush with egg
  wash. Return to oven and bake 10 minutes longer. Cut
  into 1 1/2" inch pieces and serve warm.

  In a skillet, heat butter and saute onion until golden

  is enough for 2 twelve inch knishes, so double it for
  the above recipe for knishes as that recipe makes 4

      Title: KNOEPFLE- ODER SPAETZLETEIG (BASIC SPAETZLE D
 Categories: Pasta, German
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    500 g  Flour (4 1/2 cups less 1
           -Tbsp)
      5    Eggs
      1 c  Water
           Salt
 
  Combine all ingredients and stir until the batter is
  smooth. One part at a time, force through a spaetzle
  shaver and let drop straight into boiling water.  As
  soon as the spaetzle rise to the surface, remove them
  with a slotted spoon and rinse in warm water.
  
  In olden days, the spaetzle dough was forced through a
  three- legged sieve, by means of stirring.  This
  resulted in the so- called 'Knoepfle' (little
  buttons).  Another method - more common in the
  Wuertemberg area - is to put the dough on a wooden
  board and scraping off small slivers of dough, which
  then results in elongated spaetzle, similar to the
  ones produced by a spaetzle press.
  
  Serves 4.

 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  Kofta, a classic dish of Moghul origin, is one of the
  most important preparations of Indian vegetarian
  cuisine. Traditionally, koftas are simmered in a
  delicate sauce and turned into a curried main dish.
  These kebabs are wonderful served as cocktail
  appetizers with a yogurt or fruity dipping sauce.
  
  INGREDIENTS:
  
  KOFTA:
  
  2 large russet potatoes, boiled, peeled, mashed 1/2
  cup green peas, fresh or frozen 1/4 cup shredded
  Cheddar cheese 1 fresh hot green chile, chopped 1/2
  teaspoon ground coriander 1 teaspoon cumin seeds 1 1/2
  teaspoons salt 1/4 cup chopped cashew nuts 1
  tablespoon raisins 3/4 cup chick-pea flour or corn
  flour (see note) 1 cup water Mild vegetable oil for
  deep frying
  
  SPICY CREAM SAUCE:
  
  8 whole cashew nuts 2 whole cloves Pinch nutmeg
  1/2-inch cinnamon stick 1 garlic clove, peeled 2
  tablespoons unsalted butter 1 large onion, grated
  Pinch turmeric 2 teaspoons paprika 1/2 teaspoon ground
  coriander 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon salt
  1 cup half-and-half 1 cup water 1/2 cup heavy cream 2
  tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro The kofta: Combine
  potatoes, peas, cheese, chile, coriander, cumin, salt,
  cashews and raisins. Form mixture into 1-inch balls.
  
  Make a batter with the flour and water. Season with
  pinch of salt, if desired.
  
  Heat oil to 375 degrees F in a deep fryer or large
  heavy saucepan. Dip balls into batter to coat
  completely, and deep-fry until brown (do not crowd),
  about 4 minutes. Set aside.
  
  (If you want the kebabs to remain firm, put them on a
  heated serving platter, and tent with foil. To serve,
  bring cream sauce to a boil and pour over kebabs.)
  
  The sauce: Grind cashews, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon and
  garlic with a little water to make a fine paste. Set
  aside.
  
  Heat butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.
  Add onion and saute until wilted; stir in ground paste
  and cook 2 minutes.
  
  Add turmeric, paprika, coriander, cayenne and salt.
  Stir in half-and-half and water. Reduce heat and
  simmer about 15 minutes.
  
  (May be prepared 2 days ahead, cooled, covered and
  refrigerated.)
  
  Stir in cream and kofta kebabs. Bring to a boil, then
  remove from heat. Garnish with cilantro and serve
  immediately.

      Title: KOHL'S FRUIT CAKE
 Categories: Improv, Kohl, Cakes, Fruit
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Recipe
 
  (We replaced the *ugh* raisins with apricots or left
  them out all together) First: Get out an angel food
  cake pan or two loaf pans and
        line them with brown paper (clean grocery sacks
  are okay)
  
  Second:  Mix together, then beat vigorously for 2
  minutes:
  
        1    cup good cooking oil
        4    eggs
  1 1/2 cups brown sugar, firmly packed
  
  Third: Sift together:
  
        2    cups sifted flour
        1    teaspoon baking powder
        2    teaspoons salt
        2    teaspoons allspice
        1    teaspoon gound cloves
  
  Fourth: Stir the flour mixture into the egg mixture
  alternately with 1 cup juice, wine, brandy, or rum.
  
  Fifth: Mix 1 cup sifted flour into:
  
  1 cup sliced pineapple (special jars for fruit cakes)
  1 1/2 cups whole cherries (special for fruit cakes)
        1    cup dates
        1    cup apricots or raisins
  1 cup mixed fruit (special jars for fruit cakes)
        3    cups whole pecans
  
  Sixth: Pour the batter over the fruit mixture, mixing
  well. Pour batter into the lined pan(s). Place a pan
  of water on the lower rack of the oven. In a preheated
  275 degree oven, bake 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Let cool at
  least 15 minutes before removing paper. Then wrap cake
  in a cheese cloth and store in cool, dry place - such
  as a cake tin or tupperware.
  
  NOTE: For a "Drinking Age Fruitcake" - pour rum or
  branding over the cake(s) every few days. Requires 4
  quarts, or about 1 1/2 cups for each 1/2 pound of
  fruit cake.
  
  TIPS: Glaze will not stick to a fruit cake soaked with
  rum or brandy. If you don't want your fruitcake soaked
  with rum or brandy, then prepare a glaze of:
  
        2    tablespoons brown sugar
        1    tablespoon corn syrup
        2    tablespoons water
  
  Boil for 2 minutes, and then brush over the cake.
  Decorate the cake with fruit and nuts just before
  using.
  
  Suggestions: Make some Rum Sticks by slicing cake into
  "sticks" and soaking them with rum or brandy until
  they are nearly dripping!

      1 cn Milk (14 1/2 oz)
      1 lg Package (or 2 small)
           -chocolate chips
      1 pt Marshmallow fluff
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 c  Chopped pecans.
 
  (Variation on other Recipes - This is BEST!)
  Mix together sugar, milk and butter. Stir constantly
  and boil until the soft ball stage. Test by dropping a
  drop or two of the boiling mixture into a small
  container of ice cold water. If you can roll it up
  into a ball without it melting, then it's soft ball
  stage. Remove from heat. Add chocolate chips and stir
  until melted. Add the marshmallow fluff and vanilla.
  Stir until melted and blended. Add nuts. Pour into a
  buttered platter or shallow glass pyrex oblong
  casserole dish. Cool, then refrigerate until firm. Cut
  into 1-2" squares or whatever size you want.
  
  NOTE: It may take as long as 45 minutes of stirring
  and boiling before the soft ball stage is reached. It
  depends on the kind of pot (stainless steel or ?) and
  range (gas or electric) as to how long it takes.
  
  Be sure to record the time and the exact cooking pot
  you used. Then all future preparations of this recipe
  or any of the several marshmallow fudge recipes will
  be 100% fail-proof!

  Put 1/4 of the pizza sauce on an uncooked pizza crust.
  Add desired pizza toppings such as pepperoni, sausage,
  hamburger, sliced black olives, etc.  Bake on top of

  about 1 handful each of grated cheddar cheese and
  grated mozzarella cheese. Return to oven another 12
  minutes, placing on the lower rack to brown the crust
  as well as to melt the cheese.  At the same time, if
  cooking more than one pizza, put the 2nd pizza on the

      Title: KOHL'S QUICK CHICKEN WING SAUCE
 Categories: Improv, Kohl, Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Medium or Hot Salsa/Picante
      3 tb Honey
      1 tb Lemon juice
           Red Devil Hot Sauce
           Dry Mustard
 
  Measurements are not exact!  You'll have to experiment
  until you get the taste YOU want.  For a small amount
  of this sauce, start with one cup of Salsa.  Add about
  3 T honey, 1 T lemon juice (don't need this, but it
  adds some tartness), and a few shakes of Red Devil hot
  sauce (or Tabasco). Instead of Red Devil or Tabasco,
  use dry mustard which doesn't "take over" the sauce as
  much as Red Devil or Tabasco.
  
  Mix well.  Taste.  If not hot enough, use Hot Salsa or
  Hot Picante and/or add more Red Devil.

  all with remaining sauce.
  
  Bake at 300 degrees for 1 hour or until done.  Brown
  under broiler, turning pieces over to brown both
  sides. Watch carefully and do not allow sauce to burn.
  In fact, it's best to remove the sauce until ribs are
  browned, and then spread it over the ribs after
  browning.

 Categories: Improv, Kohl, Main dish, Poultry
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
      1    Doubled Recipe corn bread
           - Prepare a week before and
           - break up to dry
  1 1/2    Loaves GOOD white bread
           - Begin drying w/corn bread
           - one week before.
     20 lb Turkey
  2 1/2 lg Onions, diced
           Celery hearts and leaves,
           - diced to equal same amount
           - as onions
           Chicken broth
           Butter
           Water
           Salt and pepper
           Sage
      6    Eggs
           Flour
 
  One week before: Bake a 9 x 13 pan of corn bread. Cool. Break into
  chunks and put in very large Tupperware container or large roasting
  pan. Add 1 & 1/2 loaves of bread - spread slices for drying moving
  around daily, and breaking up as the slices dry out. Use good bread ~
  the cheap stuff is NOT as good! Keep covered with a clean dish towel,
  do NOT seal with lid. PREPARATION AND COOKING: Clean a a thawed
  turkey (thaw in the refrigerator about 3-4 days for a 20 pound
  turkey). Place the turkey breast DOWN in a large roasting pan (enamel
  is great). Add the neck and giblets. Slice about 2 sticks of butter
  and place these all over the turkey. Open one can chicken broth and
  pour in the bottom of the pan. If the roaster lid fits, use it to
  cover the turkey. If it doesn't, make a cover with heavy foil by
  tearing off two pieces of foil about 12 inches longer than the pan
  and make a "sealed" fold along the lengthwise edges. Put over the
  turkey like a tent - that is, leave some space in the center rather
  than having the foil touch the turkey. Pinch the edges of the foil
  tightly around all edges to seal juices in as turkey bakes. Bake in a
  325 degree oven until about 1 hour BEFORE the turkey is completely
  done! You'll have to check a 20 lb turkey in about 2 1/2 hours or 3
  hours. If your turkey is TOO done, it will not be as good. Ideally,
  the meat should not be falling away from the bones. Set a timer for 2
  1/2 hours... and about 1 hour before you think the turkey is ready
  for adding the stuffing, begin preparing it. Do NOT prepare too far
  ahead of time. Dice the onions and celery hearts/leaves (if you don't
  have hearts, use lots of leaves - this is one of the "secrets" of my
  stuffing). Together, the onions and celery should equal at least 6
  cups, more or less. Remove the turkey carefully.  Move the turkey to
  another container (I use the roaster lid or an aluminum baking pan).
  Pour the broth through a strainer into the sauce pan you'll be using
  to make the gravy. Retain the rest for the stuffing. If more liquid
  is needed, use cans of chicken broth and/or 1 stick of butter to 1
  cup of water. Into a large container (I use the huge Tupperware
  bowl), put the dried corn bread, bread, onions & celery. Pour in any
  left-over broth. This may be hot, so wait for it to cool.  Mix with a
  large wooden spoon. Add enough chicken broth to cool the mixture
  enough that it can be mixed with your hands. Each hardened piece of
  corn bread and bread should be smashed with your fingers. When the
  mixture is cool enough that it won't cook the eggs, add the eggs.
  Remember to break the eggs into another container. This will prevent
  egg shells in your stuffing!!! (Eggs in stuffing: Another secret.)
  Add salt, lots of pepper, and lots of sage. Mix by hand, adding more
  broth as needed for a nice thick and moist mixture - not too sloppy.
  Taste it! This is where YOUR judgment comes into play. The stuffing
  should have a hint of pepper, and a definite taste of sage. When the
  stuffing looks right and tastes right, start putting it in the bottom
  of the roaster. Put in enough so that you have about 1/2" of stuffing
  in the pan. Now place the turkey ON TOP of the stuffing, breast UP.
  Continue adding the stuffing all around the turkey. If you have
  enough, you can completely bury the turkey in stuffing! Bury the neck
  and giblets in the stuffing - push then in and cover them. (My
  favorite part of the turkey is the neck - no one in my family DARES
  to use it in gravy!)  If you want giblet gravy (ugh!) hold back the
  giblets and do your thing with them. Cover as before, return to the
  oven for about 2 hours, or until celery and onions are tender. Make
  gravy by adding a couple of large scoops of stuffing into the
  retained broth. Make thickening of flour and water (or cornstarch) to
  thicken your gravy as desired. If you don't have enough broth, open
  another can of Chicken broth! This turkey is NOT "pretty as a
  picture" but I guarantee it's the most delicious way in the world to
  prepare turkey and stuffing (or chicken and stuffing). Clem's
  grandmother raised fourteen children and this was the only way to
  prepare enough "dressing" for the entire family. Of course, she
  cooked her meals in a wood cook stove.  This method of preparation
  was handed down to Clem's mother who then taught it to me....Joyce

 Categories: Vegetables, Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Kohlrabi
 
  It resembles a turnip in appearance.
  
  It is a relative of the cabbage, and my mother would
  boil it and serve mashed with butter.  It would also
  appear in some of the homemade soups during the fall.
  
  One cookbook we have describes the basic preparation:
  Remove leaves; save young tender ones to cook
  separately.  Pare thickened stem and cut into slices.
  May be boiled, baked, steamed or fried, dressed with
  butter or a sauce.  Young kohlrabi may be eaten raw as
  a salad, cut into julienne strips and marinated in a
  French Dressing.

 Categories: Cheese/eggs, Greek
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Uncooked Eggs
           Water
    3/4 c  Vinegar
           Red food dye or coloring
           Vegetable oil
           A few cotton balls
 
     One of the nicest Greek customs is the use of red
  eggs for the Easter celebration.  It is unthinkable to
  set an Easter table without these eggs, for they add
  to the celebration and happy atmosphere.
  
     To prepare:
  
     Carefully wash and dry each egg.  Set a large pot
  of water to boil. Add a red dye or food coloring and
  3/4 cup of vinegar to the water, and boil for a few
  minutes.  Slowly lower the eggs into the pot, and when
  the water comes to a boil, lower the heat.  Let eggs
  simmer for 15 min., then remove them carefully from
  the pot.  If you plan to cook more eggs, add an
  additional 2 tbs. vinegar to the water.  Wipe cooked
  eggs with an oil-soaked cotton ball, then wipe each
  egg with a clean dry cloth.  Place on a platter.
  Serve cold.

      1    Egg
    250 g  Rice flour
    1/2 ts Turmeric
    1/4 ts Salt
      1    Litre oil
 
  Beat the egg.  Sieve flour into a bowl and add the
  egg,  turmeric, salt and sufficient  coconut  milk  to
  make a thick batter. Heat the oil and when bubbling
  hold the kokis mould in the oil until the mould is
  hot. Carefully dip the mould into the batter, taking
  care not to submerge it completely. Remove from the
  batter and place in the hot oil where the batter
  should separate from the mould but still retain its
  shape as it deep fries. If the batter sticks it may
  need to be eased from the mould with a wooden
  toothpick. Repeat the process until all the batter is
  used. From: "A taste of Sri Lanka" by Indra

      2 pk Dry Yeast
      3 tb Sugar
      2 c  Milk; (About 110 Degrees F.)
      2 lg Eggs
      1 tb Salt
      2 tb Oil Or Melted Butter; You

           -If Needed
      1 lg Egg; Beaten With
      1 tb Water; For Glaze
      2 tb Dry Poppy Seeds
 
  Disolve 1 tsp sugar in the water and sprinkle the
  yeast over it.  Add 1 Tbl of sugar, stir and let stand
  for 10 minutes.  Combine the yeast with the milk,
  lightly beaten eggs, salt, 2 tbl sugar, oil, and 3
  cups of sifted flour.  Beat until smooth.  Cover and
  let rise in a warm place until light and bubbly, about
  1 hour.  Mix in enough of the remaining flour to make
  a light, slightly sticky dough, then knead in the bowl
  until smooth and elastic,(Remember the heavier the
  dough, the heavier the bread.) and leaves the sides of
  the bowl easily.  Or in the processor, add the yeast
  mixture to the flour and then add the liquids.  With
  the machine running, add more flour until a ball
  forms.  Allow to rest for several minutes. Process
  until the dough is smooth and elastic.  Form into a
  ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl, turning once
  to oil the top.  Cover with a linen dish towl, soaked
  in hot water and then wrung out until damp only, and
  let rise in a warm place until double in bulk.  Punch
  down and allow to rise again, slightly.  Divide the
  dough into 3 parts.  Divide 1 part into thirds,
  rolling each into a rope 8 to 10 inches long and 1 1/2
  inches thick. Braid together, starting at the middle
  and turn the ends under. Repeat with each of the
  remaining parts of the dough.  Place the loaves on
  buttered baking sheets.  Do not crowd, since the
  loaves will double in size. Cover with the damp towel
  and let rise until almost double. Brush with the egg
  glaze and sprinkle with the poppy seeds.  Bake in a
  preheated 375 Degrees F. oven at least 1 hour, or
  until golden.  Test by rapping the bottom, there
  should be a nice hollow sound.  Cool on wire racks
  until cold before cutting.

      Title: KOLACHE COOKIES
 Categories: Cookies, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Flour
      8 oz Cream cheese
    1/2 lb Butter
      1    Egg
      2 ts Sugar
           Nut Filling
    1/2 lb Ground walnuts
      1    Egg white, beaten
      1 c  Sugar or honey
    1/2 ts Almond extract
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
 
  Sift the flour and sugar together. Work in the butter,
  cream cheese and egg. Knead together. And easy way to
  do this is to put the dough inside a plastic bag -
  much less messy! Let the dough stand in the
  refrigerator overnight. About a half hour before
  you're ready to start making the cookies, put the
  dough into the freezer.
  
  For the filling, mix all of the above ingredients
  together.  You can also used canned poppy seed filling
  (Solo brand) or an apricot or prune filling.
  
  Spread flour and powdered sugar onto the surface where
  you will be rolling the dough. Roll the dough out
  thin. Cut into squares about 2 inches on each side.
  It's easiest to cut if you use a pizza cutter. Spread
  a small amount of filling (1/2 to 1 tsp) from one
  corner to the opposite corner. Don't fill them too
  much, or the filling will spill out when it is
  cooking. Fold the two remaining corners to the center,
  partially covering the filling. Wet your fingertip in
  a small bowl of water, and seal the edge, or it may
  open up during the cooking.
  
  Bake in a 375 degree oven for about 13 minutes.
  
  Makes 6 dozen small cookies.

    These are very simple, but you will find NO better
  cookie anywhere! On the down side, they do require
  advanced preparation (overnight is best).   Included
  are a couple of filling recipes, but a can of pre-made
  will work too. (Apricot is best)   When rolling out
  dough, try to keep it as chilled as possible. To cream
  the cottage cheese, it helps if you have a food
  processor or blender, but a fork and a strong arm will
  do in a pinch.   Mix ingredients and chill at least 6
  hours. Roll to 1/4" thickness. Cut into 2 or 3 inch
  squares, and place filling or preserves in center of
  square. Bring corners over filling and seal together.
  Bake at 350 - 25 to 30 minutes. Remove and dust with
  powdered sugar.   Pineapple Filling: Combine
  ingredients in sauce pan, cook stirring constantly
  until thickened. Cool.   Apricot Filling: Simmer
  apricot 10 minutes. Add sugar and simmer 10 minutes

      Title: KOLACHKI
 Categories: Cookies, Russian, Holiday
      Yield: 6 Dozen
 
MMMMM------------------------COOKIE DOUGH-----------------------------
    1/2 lb Cream cheese
           -(at room temperature)
    1/2 lb Butter (at room
           -temperature)
      3 c  Flour
      1 x  Walnut filling, below
           -OR
     12 oz Poppy seed filling
           -(1 can)

MMMMM-----------------------WALNUT FILLING----------------------------
      1 lb Walnuts, finely ground
      1    Egg
      1 c  Sugar
           Water
 
  Mix butter and cream cheese until smooth.  Add flour
  and mix again until smooth.  Making this dough is easy
  with a food processor, hard with a mixer.
  
  Roll dough into 3 balls.  Refrigerate dough to keep it
  from drying out. The dough can be refrigerated for 1-2
  hours, but it is not necessary.  Roll out 1 ball at a
  time and flour lightly. Roll dough out in flour or
  granulated sugar so it doesn't stick.
  
  Cut dough into squares or circles using cookie or
  biscuit cutter.  Add about a teaspoon of filling. Roll
  squares into "logs." Fold circles over and seal with a
  fork. Bake at 375 degrees F. for 10-15 minutes or
  until lightly browned.
  
  MAKE FILLING:  Mix all ingredients together.  Add
  water to obtain a sticky consistency.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Russian Cookies -- This recipe is from Mrs.
  Malinch, my little sister's high school Russian
  teacher.  I usually make this recipe at Christmas or
  Easter.
  
  My favorite fillings are poppy seed and walnut.  A
  recipe for the walnut filling is included.  The poppy
  seed filling can be found canned (Solo brand) in
  either the gourmet or cake section of most grocery
  stores. Yield: 6 dozen Kolachki.
  
  *  The kolachki are delicate, so do not throw them in
  a plastic bag or pile high in a jar as you would
  cookies.  The kolachki can be frozen.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate, the assembly requires nimble
  fingers. : Time:  30 minutes preparation, up to 2
  hours cooling, 15 minutes baking. : Precision:
  measure carefully.

  Well, I finally found that recipe I told you about,
  and another one that's slightly different. Neither is
  anything like the ones I saw posted on the echo the
  past few days. The first one is tried and true from my
  mom's Polish neighbor. The second is from the folks
  who make the Solo filling.

  Cream butter and cream cheese together. Add egg,
  vanilla; then mix in the flour. Cover and chill for a
  few hours to overnight. Roll out on lightly floured
  board to 1/4" thickness and cut with round cookie
  cutters. Place them on a cookie sheet as you would
  cookies. Use thumb to make indentation in center of
  each. Fill with about 1 tsp of desired filling. Bake
  at 350 F until lightly golden, about 10-15 minutes
  (guessing here, I just do it by sight).
  
  Makes enough for a whole house of hungry Polish people

      1 lb Prunes
      1 x  Cinnamon or
      1 x  Sugar
      1 ts Chopped orange peel

MMMMM---------------------POPPY SEED FILLING--------------------------
      2 c  Poppy seeds, Ground

      4 ea Apples, sliced
      3 tb Cinnamon candies
    1/3 c  Water
 
  Dissolve yeast in lukewarm water. Scald milk and set
  aside until lukewarm, not cold. Cream butter and sugar
  until light and fluffy. Add salt and mix again. Place
  dissolved yeast in milk. Add 3 cups flour and beat
  well. Stir in the creamed mixture and beat again. Then
  add unbeaten eggs and blend. Gradually add remaining
  flour, a tablespoon at a time, until dough is smooth
  enough to handle, then knead in remaining flour on a
  warmed board. The dough should be smooth and elastic
  to the touch, never hard nor stiff. Place in a greased
  bowl, cover, and allow to stand in a warm place about
  2 1/2 hours until double in bulk. Place dough on a
  warmed board, which has been slightly floured. Pat
  down dough to about 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into 2
  inch squares. Place a teaspoon of filling (recipe
  below) on each square and gather up the 4 corners
  carefully, folding one on top of the other, and press
  together so that folded dough is thinner than dough
  beneath the filling. When folded correctly, the
  filling will peek through the four sides. Place on a
  large cookie sheet about 2 inches apart. Let rise
  until double in bulk in a warm place, about 45
  minutes. Bake at 375-F for 25 minutes. When cool
  sprinkle generously  with powered sugar. Makes about
  six dozen cakes. PRUNE FILLING:
  Wash prunes and cook in enough water to cover. Bring
  to boil. When cool, strain, pit and chop well. Sweeten
  and add cinnamon to taste or orange peel. Allow to
  cool slightly before spreading. POPPY SEED FILLING:
  Combine ingredients and cook about five minutes until
  thick. APPLE FILLING:
  Cook together about five or six minutes until apples
  are soft. Cool.

  get lumpy.  Let boil for 3-4 minutes till flour taste
  is gone. If you don't care for the idea of eating the
  caraway seeds, you can quickly pour soup through
  sieve. It's all ready to serve...however, a variation
  is to scramble an egg into it for the "egg drop"
  effect. Caraway Soup - Komenymagos Leves

      Title: KONA INN BANANA BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Fruits
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Butter
      2 c  Granulated Sugar
      4    Eggs; beaten
      6    Ripe Bananas; mashed
      2 ts Baking Soda
      1 ts Salt
      2 c  All purpose Flour
    1/2 c  Macadamia Nuts chopped
 
  In a bowl cream the sugar and the butter well until a
  light lemon color. Then add the squashed bananas and
  the beaten eggs. Stir well until all ingredients are
  completely mixed. Sift the flour, the salt and the
  baking soda into the creamed mixture then add the
  chopped nuts. Again mix until blended but make sure
  you do not mix the batter too much. Pre heat the oven
  to 350 degrees and when the oven is up to temperature
  pour the batter into two prepared loaf pans and bake
  for 45 minutes. Before my wife died she often watched
  while I was making a mess in her kitchen doing my
  imitation of a bakery chef. She said that the Kona Inn
  Banana Bread should be renamed Garbage bread because I
  never stuck to the recipe and added all sorts of thing
  that I found such as any kind of chopped nuts, lemon
  and orange zest, chopped apricots, chopped mango,
  coconut flakes and one time I even added some
  mincemeat that was left over after baking some mince
  pies. Perhaps the Kona Inn should have taken me to
  court and forced me to stop making changes to their
  Banana Bread. Perhaps my use of their name for the
  resulting strange flavored versions of their Banana
  bread had something to do with their going out of
  business some years ago.

  Mix all the meatball ingredients together and roll
  into balls, 2-1/2 inches in diameter, firmly packed.
  Refrigerate them for 1 hour.
  
  To make the broth, heat the oil in a pan or soup
  kettle, add the onions and turmeric, and stir-fry over
  moderate heat until light brown, about 3 minutes.  Add
  the tomatoes and salt and stir-fry for 2 minutes more.
  Add the water and bring to a boil.
  
  Moisten your hands with cold water.  Take each herbed
  ball and roll it firmly; add the balls to the broth
  very carefully, one at a one, so that they do not not
  fall apart.  The water should just cover the balls.
  Cover the pan and cook over moderately low heat,
  without stirring, for 45 minutes.  Add the green peas
  and cook for 10 minutes more. The broth will reduce
  somewhat, the balls swell considerably due to the
  expansion of the rice.
  
  Serve warm -- with the meatballs in the broth.  Makes

MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
    3/4 c  Butter
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1    Orange (grated rind only)
      2    Egg yolks
  2 1/2 c  Flour
      1 pn Salt

MMMMM-----------------------ALMOND FILLING----------------------------
      6    Eggs; separated
    1/2 c  Caster sugar
    1/4 ts Almond essence
    1/4 c  Plain flour
    1/2 ts Baking powder
      2 c  Ground almonds
      1 pn Salt

MMMMM----------------------TO FINISH TORTE---------------------------
      8    Fillo pastry sheets
    1/4 c  Unsalted butter; melted
      2 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Water
      1    Thin strip orange rind
      1    Thin strip lemon rind
      2 ts Lemon juice
      2    Pieces cinnamon bark
 
  Cream butter and sugar with grated orange rind until
  light and fluffy; beat in egg yolks.  Sift flour and
  salt into butter mixture to form a soft dough.
  
  Lightly grease a round 20 cm (12 inch) dish (a
  "tapsi") or a 25 x 30 cm (10 x 12 inch) baking dish.
  As pastry moulds easily any tears can be pressed
  together.  An alternative is to put pastry in dish
  without rolling, and press it over base and sides with
  fingers.  Even out by rolling with a straight-sided
  glass.
  
  Bake in a moderately hot oven for 15-20 minutes until
  lightly coloured. Remove and cool.
  
  To make almond filling, beat egg yolks, sugar and
  almond essence until thick and light.  Sift flour with
  baking powder and combine with ground almonds.  Fold
  this lightly into beaten egg yolks. Beat egg whites
  with salt until stiff but not dry and fold lightly
  into almond mixture.  Pour into pastry-lined dish.
  
  On a flat surface butter a fillo pastry sheet, top
  with another and butter. Continue until all sheets are
  used.  Leave a top sheet unbuttered. Lift onto top of
  almond filling and trim edges of fillo in line with
  pastry crust, using kitchen scissors.  Brush top with
  remaining butter. With a sharp knife or razor blade
  make slits through the top 2 or 3 sheets running the
  length of the dish and spacing them 4 cm (1 1/2
  inches) apart.
  
  Bake in a moderate oven for 45 minutes until top is
  golden and filling is set.  Meanwhile dissolve sugar
  in water over medium heat, add fruit rinds, lemon
  juice and cinnamon bark and bring to the boil.  Boil
  for 10 minutes, strain and cool.  When torte is
  cooked, cut through slits in pastry down to the bottom
  crust.  Pour cooled syrup over hot torte, leave until
  cool. Cut diagonally to give diamond-shaped pieces for
  serving.

      Title: KOREAN BARBECUE - BULGOGI
 Categories: Beef, Bar-b-q, Korean
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Lean Beef Tenderloin
    1/2 c  Light Soy Sauce
    1/4 c  Dark Soy Sauce
    1/2 c  Water
      3 tb Finely Chopped Green Onion
      3 ts Crushed Garlic
      2 ts Finely Minced Fresh Ginger
    1/2 ts Black Pepper
      1 tb Sugar
      2 tb White Sesame Seeds, Toasted
           - And Ground
      1 tb Sesame Oil
 
  Bulgogi or Bulgalbi, broiled (grilled) beef strips and
  beef ribs respectively, exemplify an age-old tradition
  of cooking on a curved iron hotplate - a tradition
  that is matched in northern China and neighboring
  Mongolia as introduced by the Manchurians.  Today this
  has been streamlined for table service, with specially
  built cone-shaped hotplates fitted over tabletop
  burners, to provide an enjoyable and intimate eating
  experience. Meats of all kinds, including mutton, pork
  and poultry, offal and seafood, are cooked in this
  way, being first marinated in a spicy mixture
  encompassing the characteristic seasonings: soy sauce,
  sesame oil, garlic, ginger, pepper or chili, toasted
  sesame seeds and green onions. The meat is marinated
  well in advance so that the flavor is intense. Cooking
  time is minimal - just enough to cook through and seal
  the surface. Serve Bulgogi with white rice and
  yangnyum kanjang sauce, together with a selection of
  accompaniments such as kim chee (chili pickled
  cabbage) and jeot khal (spiced whitefish).
  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- Cut the beef across the grain into
  very thin slices, then cut into narrow strips.  In a
  glass or stainless steel dish mix all remaining
  ingredients together. Add the beef and stir
  thoroughly. Cover and let marinate for at least 3
  hours.
  
  Preheat a tabletop broiler (griller), protecting the
  tabletop with an asbestos mat or other suitable heat
  shield.
  
  Each diner, or the host/hostess, places a portion of
  meat on the broiler (griller) and cooks it quickly on
  both sides. The meat is dipped into the sauce before
  eating. Use wooden chopsticks or small forks/fondue
  forks.

 Categories: Ethnic, Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Beef-top or sirloin steak
           -(boneless)
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
      2 tb Sesame oil
    1/4 ts Pepper
      3    Green onion; finely chopped
      2    Cloves garlic; minced
      2 ts Sugar; or to taste
 
  Trim fat from beef; put in freezer for 45 minutes; cut
  beef diagonally across  the  grain  into  1/8  inch
  slices; mix remaining ingredients except sugar;  stir
  in beef and coat well. Cover and marinate at room
  temperature for 2  hours or   overnight   in   the
  refrigerator; return to room temperature before
  cooking. Add sugar and marinate another 30 minutes.
  Stir fry in hot oil using a large skillet or wok over
  medium heat until light brown, 2 to 3 minutes, do not
  crowd the pan. Serve with hot cooked rice.  Yield 4
  servings. Note: Flavor is improved if the beef is
  cooked on a bbq grill that has rods close enough
  together so the meat will not fall through. 'BULKOKEE'
  is Korea's national dish and may have been the
  inspiration for Japan's teriyaki, which it resembles.
  In Korea, the dish is usually sprinkled with toasted
  sesame seeds before serving.

  together and marinate at least 2 hours.   Can either
  cook it on the grill as kebabs or stir-fry by itself.
  Enjoy.
  
  When I don't have sirloin tips, I use flank steak and
  it tastes just as goo Also, I substitute hot pepper
  sesame oil and also add cayenne pepper for more kick.
  The sugar allows the beef to caramelize a little (I
  tried using cane sugar once but it didn't caramelize).

  the grill rack is widely spaced, place the meat strips
  in a hinged wire broiler. Broil about 1 minute on each
  side until browned but still rare. Serve with rice and
  vinegary coleslaw or cucumber salad.

      Title: KOREAN BREAD
 Categories: Korean, Breads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Malt flour
      2 lb Of red pepper powder
      5 lb Wheat flour
      1 lb Soybean flour, fermented
      1 ga Water
      1 lb Salt
 
  Lately I've been getting more into Japanese cooking
  which is different enough from Chinese that I had to
  do some serious larder stocking. It took visits to
  three different stores but I finally come up with the
  basics. One of the the stores turned out to be++ta
  da!++a Korean market so I now have the malt flour you
  keep referring to.  In fact, I just put the first loaf
  utilizing it into the bread machine a few minutes ago.
  Depending on how this loaf turns out, I'll post the
  recipe I've worked out for oatmeal bread.
  
  This Korean market is a fairly decent sized store for
  a hole in the wall and they have just about everything
  one would need for Korean cooking, including a fresh
  meat counter.  Nice find!  I'm used to buying things
  with labels I can't read, but a lot of the stock in
  this store didn't have *any* labels at all!  This
  stuff was obviously locally produced by the Korean
  community and some was recognizable as Kim Chee,
  various bean pastes and the like, but with some of the
  stuff, I had absolutely no idea what it was++or even
  whether it was animal or vegetable in origin. I'll go
  back when I have some time and find out what all those
  goodies are.
  
  Here's a recipe that was on the bag of malt flour I
  thought you might get a kick out of.  This is exactly
  the way it appeared on the bag. Put malt flour into
  lukewarm water and set aside for about 1 hour.
  
  Pour the malt melted water into pot (throw away the
  button setting). Put wheat flour into malt water, and
  make slow boil on low heat, and then simmer for about
  1 hour.  Remove the glue from heat and mix fermented
  soy bean flour and then lastly add hot pepper powder
  and salt, and mix well. *As for salt, you may add or
  reduce to your taste.
  
  *For soup use (Chigae), you better add more fermented
  soy bean flour.
  
  From the label on Haitai Brand Malt Flour.

      Title: KOREAN GRILLED BEEF
 Categories: Beef
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 ea Green onions, finely chopped
      4 ea Garlic cloves, crushed
      5 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Sesame oil
      1 tb Sesame seeds
    1/4 c  Sugar
      2 tb Sherry or mirin (rice wine)
    1/8 ts Black pepper
 
  Slice the steak diagonally against the grain into very
  thin strips. Score each piece lightly. (This prevents
  meat from curling as it is grilling). Combine
  remaining ingredients in bowl, mix well, then add
  meat. Allow to marinate for several hours or overnight.
  
  To prevent overcooking, grill meat just until it turns
  color, then remove from heat.  Remember, all meat
  continue to cook even when taken off heat. Serve with
  rice.

    1/4 c  White Vinegar
    1/4 c  White Sesame Seeds, Toasted
           - And Ground
      2 ts Finely Chopped Green Onions
 
  This cook-at-the-table one-pot dish is served with a
  biting vinegar soy sauce dip.  The meat and vegetables
  are eaten first; then the stock, well flavored by the
  ingredients and pepped up with chili, is served as a
  soup with a sprinkling of diced onions.
  
  Very thinly slice the liver, sprinkle with salt and
  pepper and fry lightly in a little vegetable oil with
  a few drops of sesame oil until colored and sealed on
  the surface.  Set aside.
  
  Boil the tripe for 8 minutes in lightly salted water;
  drain and cut into narrow strips.
  
  Cut the beef into thin slices.  Pound with a meat
  mallet or the side of a cleaver and cut into small
  squares.
  
  Mix the ground meat with the egg, adding salt, pepper
  and a few drops each of sesame oil and soy sauce.
  Form small meatballs with wet hands.  Fry in a
  half-and-half mixture of sesame and vegetable oils
  until lightly browned.
  
  Peel and slice the carrot.  Drain the mushrooms and
  remove the stems. Bring the stock to the boil in a
  suitable vessel in the center of the table. Add the
  meat, vegetables and nuts and simmer gently for about
  15 minutes. Spoon straight from the pot into small
  bowls with the vinegar soy dip.
  
  When the meat and vegetables have been eaten, add the
  finely shredded chili and green onions to the
  remaining stock and serve in soup bowls.
  
  Vinegar Soy Dipping Sauce:  Mix all ingredients.  The
  sauce keeps for several days in the refrigerator
  without the green onions, one day with the green
  onions added.

  meat gets well coated. Then take the meat from the
  marinade and dry on paper towels. Be sure to save the
  marinade. Coat the sides and bottom of a baking dish
  with 2 or 3 Tbs. of Sesame oil and arrange to pork in
  the dish so there is only one layer of the meat. Bake
  in a pre heated oven (375 F) for 50 minutes until the
  meat is tender. While the meat is bak- ing take the
  marinade and in a sauce pan bring to a boil. When
  boiling reduce the heat to low and cook for approx 15
  minutes. The amount should be a little reduced.
   When the meat is finished baking pour its cooking
  juices into the reduced marinade and bring the liquid
  to a boil again. Put the meat on a serving dish and
  pour some of the hot liquid over the pork. The remain-
  der of the hot liquid can be served seperately for
  those who wish to have more liquid on their meat or as
  a gravy on their rice. Bul-ko-kee: Almost the Korean

  Recipe by: lynne nishihara <vectr01q@HUEY.CSUN.EDU>
  Cut wings in half after removing tips. Wash and pat
  dry. Mix remaining ingredients and marinate wings 3
  hours or overnight. Batter will be thick, but will
  thin down during marinating. Deep fry until golden
  brown and drain on paper towels.
  
  Notes:  Sliced flank steak or boneless chicken pieces
  may be substituted. I usually double the sesame seeds
  and green onions.
  
  Sharon, Anna's recipe is similar to one I have.  I've
  used both flank steak and chicken (wings and breast
  fillet strips). The main difference seems to be the
  addition of flour and cornstarch and deep frying
  (watch them arteries!).  I posted it a long while ago,
  so this is a reprint.

      Title: KORMA
 Categories: Indian, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Poultry or meat
    1/2 c  Cashews, almonds or mixture
    1/2    Inch chopped fresh ginger
      1    Clove garlic chopped
      2    Green chillies (optional)
    1/2 ts Saffron
      2 tb Warm milk
      1 tb Ghee
      2 tb Sunflower or corn oil
      1    Medium onion chopped
      3 oz Yoghurt
      3 oz Cream
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh coriander
           Salt
           Lemon juice (optional)

MMMMM---------------------------SPICES--------------------------------
      2    Whole cardamoms
      3    Whole cloves
      1    Inch cassia bark
      1 ts Coriander seeds
      1 ts Cummin seeds
 
  1) Cut the meat into 1 inch cubes (the poultry on or
  off the bone, to taste) 2) Blend the nuts, ginger,
  garlic and chilles into a course paste with 1/4 pint
  of water 3) Soak the saffron in warm milk for 10
  minutes. 4) Heat the ghee and oil together, then fry
  the spices then onion until golden. Add the nut paste
  and yoghurt, and cok for 10 minutes or so. 5) Add the
  meat, mixing in well. Simmer for about 1 hour or until
  the meat is tender. Add water bit by bit if needed. 6)
  About 10 minutes before serving, squeeze the saffron
  strands in their bowl to get the most colour out of
  them then add in, with the milk. Add the cream, fresh
  coriander and salt to taste. Garnish with lemon juice
  if liked. Notes: 1) Coriander. You may know it as
  "cilantro or Chinese parsley" 2) Cassia bark. Similar
  to cinnamon but with a sweet musky fragrance. 3) When
  frying the spices use a gentle heat as they are easily
  burnt!! True kormas are spicy, not hot, and a Moghul
  creation. Their special feature is a creamy sauce with
  nut and safron. They can be made with chicken (my
  favourite), duck, lamb, beef or mutton and should be
  served with plain or pullao rice.

 Categories: India, Main dish, Herb/spices, Ethnic
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Unsalted cashews
      3 ea Dried hot red chilies
      2 ea In piece of stick cinnamon
      1 ea 1 in cube fresh ginger
    1/4 ts Cardamom seeds
      3 ea Whole cloves
      2 ea Large garlic cloves peeled
      2 tb Poppy seed (white)
      1 tb Coriander seeds
      1 ts Cumin seeds
    1/2 ts Saffron threads
      6 tb Ghee (or melted butter)
      1 c  Chopped onion
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Unflavored yoghurt
  1 1/2 lb Lamb cut into 2" cubes
      2 tb Finely chopped coriander
      1 tb Lemon juice
    1/4 c  Boiling water
      1 c  Cold water
 
  To make the masala,  combine the cashews,  chilies,
  ginger and the cold water  and  blend  at  high speed
  for 1 minutes. Add the cinnamon, cardamom, cloves,
  garlic, poppy seeds, coriander seeds and cumin. Blend
  again until the mixture is completely pulverized. Set
  the masala aside. Place  the saffron in a small bowl,
  pour in boiling water and let soak for at least 10
  minutes. In  a  heavy skillet heat the ghee over
  moderate heat until  a  drop  of water flicked into it
  sputters instantly. Add the onions and, stirring
  constantly,  fry for 7 or 8 minutes, until soft and
  golden brown.  Stir in   the  salt and the masala,
  then add the yoghurt.
   Stirring occasionally,  cook over moderate heat until
  the ghee lightly films  the surface. Add the lamb,
  turning it about with a spoon to coat the pieces
  evenly. Squeeze the saffron between your fingers, thin
  stir it and its  soaking liquid  into the skillet.
  Reduce the heat to low, cover tightly, and cook for 20
  minutes, turning the lamb cubes over from time to
  time. Scatter  1/2 of the fresh coriander over the
  lamb and continue cooking, tightly covered for 10
  minutes more, or until the lamb is tender. To  serve,
  transfer  the  entire contents of the skillet to a
  heated platter,  and  sprinkle the top with lemon
  juice and the remaining fresh coriander.

 Categories: Greek, Pies, Desserts
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias

MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
      1 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Confectioners' sugar
    1/2 tb Finely grated lemon peel
      1 pn Salt
      8 tb Unsalted butter
           - cut into small pieces
      2    Egg yolks
      1 ts Vanilla extract

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      8 tb Unsalted butter
           - at room temperature
    1/3 c  Honey
      5    Egg yolks
  1 1/2 c  Ground blanched almonds
      2    Lemons; juiced
    1/4 c  Heavy cream
    1/2 c  Superfine sugar
    1/2 c  -Water
      1    Lemon; juiced

MMMMM------------------------FOR SERVING-----------------------------
           Confectioners' sugar; sifted
 
  To make the pastry, sift the flour and confectioners'
  sugar into a large cold bowl, stir in the grated lemon
  zest and salt, and add the butter. Quickly and lightly
  rub the mixture together with your fingers until it
  resembles coarse meal.  Beat the egg yolks and vanilla
  together and stir into the flour mixture.  Pull the
  dough together into a ball with your fingers, adding
  cold water only if necessary to make a soft dough.
  Tightly cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30
  minutes.
  
  Set a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven
  to 375 F.
  
  Lightly flour a work surface and roll out the pastry
  to fit a 9- to 10-inch tart pan with a removable
  bottom.  To transfer the pastry, wrap it around the
  rolling pin, lift above the pan, and unroll over the
  rim.  With your thumb and knuckle, gently press the
  pastry into the pan, then roll the rolling pin over
  the rim to trim the edges.  Line with aluminum foil
  and bake 6 to 8 minutes or until just set.  Set aside,
  and lower the oven temperature to 325 F.
  
  To make the filling, beat the butter and honey with an
  electric mixer or by hand until pale and creamy.  Beat
  in the egg yolks one at a time.  Then stir in the
  almonds, the juice of 2 lemons (reserve the zest,
  removed in thin strips), and the cream.  Pour into the
  pastry shell and lightly smooth the top with a
  spatula.  Bake 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown
  and set.
  
  Meanwhile, combine the superfine sugar, reserved lemon
  zest, and water in a sugar pan or small heavy
  saucepan.  Slowly bring to a boil, then simmer 6
  minutes or until the syrup lightly coats the back of a
  metal spoon.  Set aside to cool slightly.
  
  Add the remaining lemon juice to the barely warm syrup
  and strain, reserving the zest.  Pour the syrup over
  the warm pie, remove from the pan, and liberally
  sprinkle with confectioners' sugar and the reserved
  zest. Serve immediately.
  
  Note: To make the pastry in the food processor, chill
  the processor bowl and metal blade in the refrigerator
  for 1 hour.  Working very quickly, process the flour,
  sugar, lemon zest, and butter until the mixture
  resembles coarse meal.  Add the egg yolks and vanilla
  and pulse just to mix.  (It is unlikely that you will
  need to add water.)  Wrap and refrigerate.

 Categories: Greek, Poultry
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      1    Chicken, stewed
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine
    1/4 c  All-purpose flour
  2 1/2 c  Chicken broth/stock; warmed
    1/4 c  Milk, optional
      3    Eggs; lightly beaten
    3/4 c  Grated cheese *(see note)
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
      1 ts Grated nutmeg
           Thyme or mint leaves;chopped
     12    Commercial filo sheets
 
  *Note: Suggested cheeses are either Mizithra or
  Kefalotyri.  If unavailable, Parmesan or Romano could
  be substituted.  :-(
  
  Remove the bones and skin from chicken and discard.
  With your fingers tear the chicken into strips, not
  too small.  Set aside while you prepare the sauce.
  Melt the 4 T butter in a heavy pan, then blend in the
  flour, without scorching, over medium heat.  Remove
  from the heat for a minute and stir in the warm broth,
  then return to the heat and cook gently until the
  sauce boils.  Cool.  Mix in the milk if the sauce
  seems too thick, then add the eggs, cheese, a little
  salt, pepper, nutmeg, and thyme.
  
  Butter a 9 x 12 x 3-inch baking pan and in it spread 6
  filo sheets, brushing each with melted butter.  Pour
  in the chicken filling, then cover with the remaining
  filo sheets.  Tuck the top filo over the bottom and
  flute the edges.  Score the top 3 filo sheets with a
  sharp knife.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 40
  minutes, or until crisp and golden chestnut in color.
  Remove from oven and let stand for 15 minutes before
  cutting into 9 to 12 squares.  Serve warm.  (Serves 9
  to 12)
  
  Note: In Epirus, Kotopita is sometimes made with a
  large amount of onions. If you would like to try it,
  use the recipe above plus 1 pound of Spanish- type
  onions.  Peel and slice the onions, boil in water for
  5 minutes, and drain.  Prepare the sauce without the
  cheese and bake the chicken and onions in the sauce,
  between homemade filo, preferably, or commercial filo.

      Title: KOTOPOULO KOKKINISTO ( REDDENED CHICKEN )
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Frying or roasting chicken*
      3 tb Vegetable oil or butter
      1    Onion; chopped
      2 tb Butter
      2 tb All-purpose flour (optional)
      1 c  Dry white wine
           - (more if necessary)
      2 c  Chopped, drained tomatoes
      2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
      1 pn Dried marjoram or thyme
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
           Water if necessary
 
  *Note: Chicken should be about 3 pounds, and cut into
  serving pieces. Wash and dry the chicken.  In a frying
  pan, heat the oil or butter and sear the chicken over
  high heat, turning constantly to avoid burning the
  chicken.  Remove each piece when reddish in color.
  Lower the heat and saute the onion until soft, adding
  butter while stirring.  For a thicker sauce, add the
  flour and cook 2 minutes, then add the wine and
  tomatoes. Simmer until thickened, then strain the
  sauce into a baking-serving casserole.  Sprinkle the
  herbs over the chicken, season lightly with salt and
  pepper, and shake the casserole gently.  Chicken
  should be almost covered with liquid; if not, add a
  little water.  Cover tightly and simmer over low heat
  or transfer to a medium oven (350 F) to bake for 1
  hour, or until the chicken is tender and the sauce
  thick.  Serve warm.

 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------------EQUIPMENT------------------------------
           1 kouglof mold (1x3.5 litre/
           -- 6 pints or 2x1.75 litre)
           -- Traditionally, Kouglof
           -- (also spelt Kugelhopf or
           -- gougelhopf) is baked in a
           -- tall, fluted mold.
           -- A savarin or baba mould
           -- can be used instead.

MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
     25 g  Fresh yeast (1 oz)
    120 ml Milk (4 fl oz), boiled and
           -- cooled to lukewarm
     15 g  Fine salt (1/2 oz)
    500 g  Flour (1 lb 2 oz)
      6    Eggs
    350 g  Butter (12 oz)
     75 g  Sugar (3 oz)

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
    200 g  Raisins (7 oz)
      3 tb Rum
    100 g  Whole almonds (4 oz),skinned
           -- and very light toasted
      1    Egg yolk mixed with 1 table-
           -- spoon milk
           Butter for the mould
           Icing sugar for dusting
 
  Preparation, dough
  Put the yeast and the milk in the bowl of your mixer
  and beat lightly. Add the salt, then the flour and the
  eggs. Switch the mixer on to medium speed and work the
  mixture with the dough hook for about 10 minutes,
  until the dough is smooth and elastic with plenty of
  body. If you are making it by hand, use a spatula and
  work the dough for about 20 minutes. Mix together the
  butter and sugar, reduce the speed of the mixer to low
  and add the butter mixture to the dough, a little at a
  time, working the dough continuously. When all the
  butter is incorporated, increase the speed and mix for
  8 to 10 minutes in the mixer or about 15 minutes by
  hand, until the dough is very smooth and glossy. It
  should be supple and fairly elastic and will be coming
  away from the sides of the bowl. Cover the dough with
  a baking sheet and leave it in a warm place (about 24
  C/75 F) for 2 hours, until it has doubled in bulk.
  Knock back the dough by punching it with your fist not
  more than 2 or 3 times. Cover it with a baking tray
  and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, but not loner
  than 24 hours.
  
  Preparation, raisins:
  Put the raisins in a bowl with the rum, cover with
  clingfilm and leave to macerate for several hours.
  
  Moulding
  Generously butter the mould and place one-third of the
  almonds in the bottom of the ridges.
  On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled
  dough into a narrow rectangle long enough to line the
  bottom of the mould. Chop the remaining almonds and
  strew them and the rum-soaked raisins over the dough.
  Roll out the dough into a fat sausage shape, pressing
  it firmly together. Arrange it round the bottom of the
  mould and press down lightly. Seal the two edges
  together with a very little egg yolk-milk-mixture.
  Leave in a warm place (about 25 C/77 F) for about 2
  1/2 hours, until the dough has risen to three-quarters
  fill the mould. Preheat the oven to 220 C/425 F.
  Bake the kouglof in the preheated oven for 10 minutes,
  then lower the temperature to 200 C/400 F and cook for
  another 35 minutes. If it is becoming to brown towards
  the end, cover it with greaseproof paper. Invert the
  hot kouglof on to a wire rack, carefully remove the
  mould and return it to the oven for 5 minutes so that
  the centre finishes cooking and becomes ligthly
  coloured. Leave to cool for at leat 2 hours before
  serving.
  
  Serving
  Lightly sprinkle with icing sugar.
  Kouglof freezes very well once cooked. Wrap in a
  plastic bag and freeze; it will keep for several
  weeks. Be sure to take it out of the freezer 2 or 3
  hours before serving. (The Roux Brothers, French
  country cooking, M Papermac, 1992, ISBN 0-333-57670-5)

      3 c  Plain flour
      1 pk Active dry yeast
    1/2 c  Warm water
    1/2 c  Warm milk
           -- (water may be substitued)
      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Sugar
      2 tb Oil
           Sesame seeds
 
  Dissolve yeast in warm water.  Mix in remaining
  ingredients except sesame seeds, using more or less
  flour, as necessary, to form a workable dough.
  
  Knead dough until smooth; shape into a ball and place
  in an oiled bowl. Cover and let rise in warm place
  until doubled in bulk.  Punch down and turn out onto a
  floured surface to shape.  Form dough into a thick
  rope about 20 inches in length, slightly tapered at
  each end. Place rope in the shape of a ring on a
  greased baking sheet, overlapping and tucking under
  ends.  Cover and let rise again.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 F. (190 C.).  Brush bread with
  water and sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Bake until
  bread is golden brown, about 30 minutes.
  
  Variation - Elioti (Olive Bread):
  
  Prepare 1 quantity of Kouloura dough, as directed
  above. During first rising, saute 1 medium onion in 1
  tablespoon olive oil until transparent. Lightly smash
  1 cup of Greek black olives with a wooden mallet or
  knife handle to split; remove pits from olives.  Mix
  olives and onions together and let cool.
  
  After punching down dough, turn onto a floured surface
  and roll out to form a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick.
  Cover rectangle with onion and olive mixture, leaving
  a border around edges.  Starting at one long end, roll
  up dough and shape into a loaf.  Press edges closed.
  
  Place loaf on a greased baking sheet and slash
  diagonally in three or four places.  Cover and let
  rise again until double in size.  Bake in a preheated
  375 F. (190 C.) oven about 35-40 minutes.

      1    Egg

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
      1    Egg yolk
    1/4 c  Sesame seeds
 
  Melt yeast in warm water.  Set aside.  Bring milk to
  boil.  Add sugar, butter and salt.  Allow milk to cool
  slightly.
  
  Put flour in a large bowl leaving about a tablespoon
  of it in the measuring cup for hands and make a hole
  in the center.  Pour liquid into it. Add yeast and
  egg.  Start mixing with spoon or paddle, pushing flour
  from all sides into center.  Dough will be sticky
  until flour is absorbed. Begin kneading dough in the
  bowl and then transfer it to a lightly floured board.
  Continue kneading until dough is smooth and elastic,
  about 20 minutes.
  
  Place dough in a greased bowl.  Cover with towel
  dampened with hot water. Set aside in a warm place to
  rise until bulk has doubled, about 4 hours.
  
  Punch down in the middle.  Knead for a few minutes and
  shape into a round loaf or into individual rolls (see
  below).  Using fingers, rub top with egg yolk and
  sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Place in greased baking
  pans. Let rise once more, uncovered, in a warm place,
  approximately 1 hour.
  
  Bake in preheated oven at 375 F for 45 minutes.
  Remove from oven; allow to cool 10 minutes before
  removing bread from pan.
  
  To Shape Traditional KOULOURA:  Divide dough into 3
  long ropes.  Braid together.  Place braid in a greased
  tube pan or a large round baking pan. Stretch dough to
  make ends meet.  Use egg yolk to stick ends together.
  
  To Shape KOULOURAKIA Rolls:  Pinch off pieces of
  dough.  Roll on board with the palms of your hands to
  make a rope 6" long.  Twist it into a hairpin, coil
  the ends around each other and stick the tips together
  with a dab of egg yolk.  Or coil it like a snake,
  round and round; or roll into small round balls using
  the palms of your hands.  Do not flatten or press down
  as you roll.

      Title: KOURABIEDES
 Categories: Cookies, Greek, Christmas
      Yield: 30 Pieces
 
      2 c  Butter, unsalted
      1 c  Sugar, powdered
      3    Egg yolks
      3 tb Brandy
      2 ts Vanilla extract
      6 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Almonds (blanched),
           -chopped
      1 lb Sugar, powdered
           -(one package)
 
  Beat the butter with the sugar until it becomes
  fluffy.  Add the egg yolks one by one, beating
  continuously. Add the brandy and vanilla.
  
  Blend in the almonds and the flour, a cup at a time.
  Use enough flour to get a firm dough (it may take a
  bit more or less than the amount mentioned in the
  ingredients list). Use your hands to do the mixing, as
  an electric mixer will be useless after the first two
  or three cups of flour have been added. Place the
  dough in the refrigerator for at least one hour.
  
  Shape the dough into balls, about one inch in
  diameter, flatten them and place on greased cookie
  sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 20 minutes.
  
  Remove from the oven.  Roll each cookie (while it is
  still hot) in the powdered sugar and put it back on
  the cookie sheet.  Repeat this step once more, so that
  you get a thicker coating.
  
  Place the coated cookies on a platter, liberally
  sprinkling each layer and the bottom of the platter
  with powdered sugar. When you are done, there
  shouldn't be any sugar left. Let them cool and they
  are ready to eat!
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Traditional Greek Christmas cookies coated with
  powdered sugar -- This is one of the two kinds of
  confection that are traditionally consumed in large
  quantities in Greece during the holiday season (the
  other is melomacarona). As a quick lesson in greek,
  "kourabiedes" (pronounced "kou-ra-bi-ETH-es", is the
  plural of the word "kourabies" (kou-ra-bi-ES). Now all
  you need to enjoy them is the recipe. I got this one
  from a Greek cookbook and translated it into English.
  
  *  The cookbook suggests the following variations:
  using ouzo or scotch instead of brandy, and almond
  extract instead of vanilla extract, but I have not
  tried any of them. Also, putting granulated instead of
  powdered sugar in the dough didn't seem to affect the
  recipe, there's so much sugar in it, that you couldn't
  tell the difference anyway.
  
  *  The cookbook also suggested using twice the amount
  of sugar for coating. This is obviously too much, but
  it should make you realize that you must really be
  liberal with the sugar!

      Title: KOURAMBIEDES
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 50 Servings
 
      1 c  Sweet butter
    1/2 c  Powdered sugar
      1    Egg yolk
      2 tb Brandy or Cognac (optional)
      1 ts Almond extract
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 ts Baking powder
  2 1/4 c  Sifted cake flour; (or more)
    3/4 c  Ground almonds; toasted
      1 lb Powdered sugar; sifted
 
  In electric mixing bowl, whip the sweet butter until
  it is fluffy and white.  Continuing to beat on medium
  speed, gradually add the 1/2 cup powdered sugar, egg
  yolk, and flavorings.
      Meanwhile, sift the baking powder with the flour
  and gradually add to the batter, mixing by hand and
  working the flour thoroughly into the mixture before
  adding more.  Mix in ground almonds.  Knead until a
  soft, buttery dough is formed that will stay together
  when a little is rolled in the palms of your hands.
  Break off pieces slightly larger than a walnut, then
  roll into balls, half-moons, or S-curves.  Place on
  cookie sheets allowing an inch between each.  Bake on
  the center rack of a 350-degree oven for 12 to 15
  minutes or until golden colored, not chestnut.  Remove
  from the oven and carefully lift each Kourambie and
  place on a generous layer of sifted powdered sugar.
  Immediately sift more powdered sugar over to cover
  Kourambiedes.  Allow to cool for 10 to 15 minutes
  before lifting and rolling to be sure they are evenly
  coated.  May be served in individual fluted paper
  cups, with a bit of additional powdered sugar sifted
  over tops.

      2 lg Onions
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      1    Garlic clove (or more)
           -- finely chopped
 
  This is classed as an 'oil' dish by Coptic Egyptians
  and is prepared during periods of fasting when animal
  products cannot be taken.  You may cook the lentils,
  macaroni and rice simultaneously in 3 pots, or if,
  like me, you like to keep pots to a minimum, use the
  method given. This is the way they prepare it in Egypt
  anyway.
  
  Place lentils in a sieve and wash well under running
  water.  Place in a large pot and add 3 cups water and
  1 teaspoon salt.  Bring to the boil, then simmer for 1
  hour until tender but still intact.  Drain and keep
  aside.
  
  Clean same pot and add 4 cups water.  Bring to the
  boil, add 2 teaspoons salt and the macaroni.  Stir
  constantly until water returns to the boil and cook,
  uncovered, for 15 minutes until tender.  Stir
  occasionally. Drain and keep aside.  Clean pot again
  and dry.
  
  Wash rice well in sieve under running water and drain.
  Heat oil in pot and fry rice over medium heat for 2-3
  minutes.  Add 2 cups water and 1 teaspoon salt and
  bring to the boil, stirring occasionally. Cover and
  simmer over low heat for 15 minutes or until tender.
  Leave covered off the heat for 5 minutes for grains to
  separate.
  
  Prepare the ta'leya (directions below), add tomato
  puree and bring to the boil.
  
  Add lentils and macaroni to cooked rice and toss
  together lightly with a fork.  Pour hot ta'leya and
  tomato mixture on top, toss again and cover pot.
  Leave over low heat for 10 minutes.  Serve hot.
  
  TA'LEYA: Halve peeled onions lengthwise then slice
  thinly to give semicircles.  Heat olive oil in a pan,
  add onions and fry over medium heat until golden
  brown.  Add garlic and cook a minute longer.

           -parsley
 
  some estragon (and I not sure what that is in english,
  I think any "italian" herb would be fine) salt, white
  pepper to taste 1 Tablespoon lemon juice, a couple of
  drops worcester sauce soften butter at room temp., add
  finely chopped herbs, add remaining ingredients. Mix
  slowly with a fork. Wet a piece of waxed paper lightly
  with cold water. Put butter on paper over the length
  and form a roll......... Put in fridge for it to get
  hard. Shortly before serving, cut slices of butter
  with knife dipped in hot water and put on plate on top
  of icecubes. I personally like to add garlic (freshly
  pressed through the garlic press). You can also add
  some anchovy paste. or make it with dill instead of
  parsley. Whatever herbs and spices you like; but it's
  always better w/fresh herbs. Have fun. This recipe is

      Title: KRANSEKAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 Cake
 
 17 1/2 oz Ground bitter almonds
 17 1/2 oz Icing sugar
      3 tb Potato flour
      3    Egg whites

MMMMM---------------------------ICING--------------------------------
      5 oz Icing sugar
      1    Egg white
 
  This recipe requires bitter almonds. Bitter almonds
  are poisonous if eaten raw but baking destroys the
  toxins and produces a more concentrated flavour. If
  bitter almonds are unavailable, then ordinary almonds
  will suffice.
  
  The Story:
  
  Roal Dahl: (...) Like "krokaan" and "riskrem",
  "kransekake" (pronounced 'kranserkaker') is a totally
  Norwegian food, which every Norwegian man, woman and
  child knows as well as the British know baked beans
  and sausages. Happily, it is a good deal more subtle
  than either of those bland old British stand-bys.
  
  It is, in fact, a magnificent many-tiered cake made of
  ring upon ring of wonderful macaroon-like biscuit, and
  no self-respecting Norwegian house is without a
  kransekake on the table for the Christmas feast.
  
  At Easter they do it all over again, except that the
  kransekake is turned upside-down to make a basket, and
  one of the larger rings is broken in two to form
  handles for the basket.
  
  Over there they love their kransekake so much that it
  has become a sort of national symbol, which they
  bedeck with Norwegian flags on these festive occasions
  (...). A kransekake is obviously a bit of trouble to
  make, but in Norway every mother, sweetheart and cook
  thinks that the trouble is well worthwhile, and with
  this I heartily agree. It isn't only the actual taste
  that is so seductive; it is the aura of grandness this
  great towering cake gives to the table that makes it
  so splendid.(...)
  
  The Recipe:
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 oF / 200 oC.
  
  Oil the kransekake moulds if you are lucky enough to
  have them; don't worry if they are not available.
  
  Sieve the icing sugar and potato flour into a bowl
  with the ground almonds.
  
  Very lightly whisk the egg whites until fluffy and mix
  into the dry ingredients.
  
  Knead to a soft but firm dough.
  
  Pipe into the moulds or roll the mixture into
  5/8-in.-thick ropes on a worktop lightly dusted with
  icing sugar. The small rope should be 5 1/2 in. long
  and the next 1 in. longer and so on. Make approx 14-15
  ropes.
  
  Join the ropes into rings and place on an oiled baking
  tray, allowing plenty of room for expansion.
  
  Bake in oven for 8-10 minutes until crisp and golden.
  
  Leave to cool completely before removing.
  
  To assemble, sieve the icing sugar into a bowl.
  
  Add the egg white and beat until smooth.
  
  Make a greaseproof piping bag and fill with some of
  the icing. Snip off the point of the bag. Pipe icing
  on top of the largest ring and stick the next sized
  ring on top. Continue sticking the rings together in
  this way to form a pyramid.
  
  Now decorate each ring with a dropped line forming a
  scalloped effect.
  
  Norwegians decorate the kransekake with Norwegian
  flags and red ribbons tied into bows at Christmas, and
  with flowers and eggs at Easter.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Herbs *
      4 tb Butter
      1 lg Onion, chopped
      1 qt Water or vegetable stock
      1 lg Potato, peeled and chopped
           -into small cubes
 
  Serves 4.
  
  salt and pepper bread cubes for croutons
  
  * at least 3 of these:  chervil, watercress, spinach,
  sorrel (dandelion and pimpernel for brave souls)
  Bitter herbs are traditionally eaten at Easter in
  Christian countries as a sign of penitence. This
  Bavarian soup is served on Easter Thursday, known as
  Maundy Thursday. Fresh chervil, easily available in
  any German market, is usually the dominating flavor.
  This is a delicate fresh-tasting soup for any time of
  the year.
  
  You will need a large saucepan.  Pick over and wash
  the herbs, stripping the leaves from those stalks
  which are too woody.  Chop the rest.
  
  Melt the butter in a deep pan and fry the onion gently
  until transparent. Add the herbs and sweat them for a
  moment before you pour in the water or broth.  Add the
  potato to the soup. Bring the soup to a boil, and then
  turn down the heat.  Simmer for 20 minutes.  Mash the
  potato in the soup to thicken it a little.  Taste, and
  add salt and freshly milled pepper.
  
  Serve with bread croutons fried in butter or bacon fat
  (goose fat is even better).  They should be so hot
  that they sizzle when they are added to the hot soup
  at the table.

  tomatoes, and parsley and season with salt and pepper.
  Cover the pan and simmer for 30 minutes, adding the

  3-inch baking pan with 6 filo sheets, buttering each.
  Spread the filling over the filo evenly, then top with
  the remaining filo sheets, buttering each as before.

      Yield: 60 Servings
 
      3 tb Butter or margarine
      2    Shallots or onions; minced
      1 lb Lean ground lamb or beef
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
      3    Sprigs fresh parsley;chopped

      1    Egg; lightly beaten
      1 tb Bread crumbs; if necessary
      1 lb Commercial filo sheets
      1 c  Butter; melted
 
  *Note: Suggested cheeses for this recipe are Greek
  kefalotyri or Parmesan. Heat the 3 tablespoons butter
  or margarine and cook the shallots until soft, then
  add the meat and mash with a fork over medium heat
  until the color changes.  Add the wine and simmer a
  few minutes.  Stir in the herbs and tomato sauce;
  season with salt and pepper to taste and simmer for 20
  minutes.  Cool.  Add the cheese and egg, and if the
  mixture is very liquid, stir in the bread crumbs
  immediately before stuffing. Filo sheets should be
  unrolled flat, and cut into thirds (3 x 11 inches).
  Pile up the filo, covering it with waxed paper and a
  damp towel.  Take out one sheet at a time and keep the
  rest covered.  Butter the filo, one sheet at a time,
  using a pastry brush and the 1 cup melted butter.
  Place 1 teaspoon of the meat filling 1 inch from the
  end nearest you.  Fold the filo back over the filling
  so the bottom edge meets the left edge, forming a
  right angle. Continue folding back at right angles to
  make the triangular shape.  Place on baking sheets and
  keep covered until all are ready to bake.  Bake in a
  moderate oven (350 degrees) for 20 to 25 minutes or
  until golden and crisp, turning once.  Serve hot.

           -ingredients at room temp.)
      1 tb Water
    1/2 ts Salt

  Prepare one recipe noodle dough (see below).  Roll out
  but don't let dry. Cut into 3-inch squares and place a
  tablespoon of one of the following mixtures on each.
  Fold over the dough into a triangle. Press edges
  together with a little water. Cook in boiling salted
  water or soup 20 minutes, or until they rise to the
  top. They can then be fried or served immediately in
  the soup. Makes 24 or more, according to how thin you
  roll the dough.
  
  HOMEMADE NOODLE DOUGH
  
  Place unsifted flour on a board and make a well in the
  center.  Drop eggs, water and salt into it.  Work the
  four with one hand and knead until smooth and elastic.
  Roll and stretch the dough as thin as possible. The
  thinner it is, the better the noodles. ***STOP HERE
  FOR KREPLACH RECIPE*** Let the rolled dough stand
  until it feels dry to the tough, but don't let it get
  too dry.  you can cut the dough into squares, strips
  or very narrow noodles.  For narrow ones roll up like
  jelly roll and slice as thin as possible.  Shake until
  they separate, and let dry very thoroughly.  Cook the
  amount you want in boiling salted water or soup for
  about 10 minutes. Keep the balance in tightly closed
  jars.

  NOODLES: This is a lost art. may I add that I usually
  use wonton skins and make life easy for myself; but
  once in awhile.... Add salt to eggs,add eggs to flour.
  mix with your hands until the dough leaves the sides
  of the bowl. It should be fairly stiff. Knead until
  dough is smooth and elastic. Roll out on a lightly
  floured board (or on a white cloth). Roll and stretch
  until it is paper thin...well very thin. Cut into 3"
  squares. Place one T of filling in center of each
  square and fold to make a triangle. Crimp edges with a
  fork and cook in boiling water. If you have a pasta
  machine (or I sometimes use FP go for it. Cook until
  they rise to the top; about 10 or 12 minutes. DO NOT
  COOK IN THE SOUP. You may warm them in the soup.
   FILLINGS. These days I zap all the ingredients for
  each type of filling in the FP...leaving the eggs for
  last. For the cheese filling, you just want to
  combine. I would serve all but the cheese with Chicken
  Noodle soup. the Cheese Kreplach are usually served on
  the side (for a dairy meal) with sour cream. Each of
  these recipes makes about 30; figure at least 3 each

 Categories: Cookies, Thai
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
      2 c  Flour
      1 ea Egg Yolk
    1/2 c  Coconut Cream *
      3 tb Lime Water (CaCO3 Solution)
           Oil for Frying

MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------
      1 tb Cilantro Roots, Chopped Fine
      1 ts Ground Black Pepper
      1 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Coconut Sugar
      2 tb Jasmine Water (Extract)
 
  * Coconut cream is the rich heavier portion of coconut
  milk, either from the first "pressing", or skimmed of
  the top of coconut milk that's been set aside for
  about an hour in the refrigerator. Sift the flour and
  add egg yolk.  Knead the yolk into the flour while
  slowly adding the coconut cream and lime water.  Knead
  until the dough is soft and shiny.  Divide the dough
  into small round balls, approximately 1 inch in
  diameter. You may make it larger or smaller, if
  desired. The dough ball is then "formed" onto a
  grooved wooden form into a small thin sheet, with
  "ridges" on one side.  Fry the formed dough in hot oil
  till golden brown.  Drain well and set aside to cool
  completely. In the meantime, add jasmine water to the
  coconut sugar in a good size frying pan over a low
  heat.  When the sugar is fully melted and combined
  with the jasmine water, add the cilantro roots, salt,
  and peppers that had been previously blended together.
  Turn the heat up to medium and mix all the ingredients
  well.  Continue to stir, preventing the syrup from
  burning, until the syrup is "fragrant". Add the cooled
  fried dough and distribute the syrup all over the
  dough. Remove the coated dough pieces from the pan and
  spread out to cool on a tray lined with waxed paper.
  When cold, they may be stored in air-tight container.

  less heat, discard the chilli seeds.
  
  Remove the stems and roughly chop the chillies.  Put
  into an electric blender with all of the other
  ingredients and blend to a smooth paste. Add a Tbls of
  extra oil or a little water, if necessary, to
  facilitate blending and store as you would the red

      Title: KRUMIRI
 Categories: Cookies, Italian
      Yield: 48 Servings
 
      1 c  Unsalted butter
    2/3 c  Sugar
      3    Egg yolks
      1 ts Vanilla extract
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 c  Yellow cornmeal
 
  PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 325F. Beat the butter with the
  sugar by hand, with a hand mixer set at medium speed,
  or in a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the paddle.
  Continue beating until the mixture lightens both in
  texture and color, about 4 or 5 minutes. Beat in the
  vanilla, then the yolks, one at a time, beating smooth
  after each addition. Stir the flour and cornmeal
  together, and stir into the butter mixture by hand.
  Line 2 or 3 cookie sheets with parchment paper and
  pipe the Krumiri in horseshoe or stick shapes, using a
  pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch star tube (Ateco
  #4). Bake about 15 minutes. Remove from pans and cool
  on a rack. VARIATION OF KRUMIRI: SCHIACCATINE DI
  GRANTURCO. These wonderful biscotti are always on the
  bar at Tonino and Claudia Verro's charming inn,
  Contea, at Neive, near Alba in Piemonte. The
  surrounding area, known as the Langhe for its
  situation in the Langa hills, has some of Italy's most
  breathtaking natural scenary, as well as excellent
  wine and Grappa. FOLLOW THE RECIPE FOR KRUMIRI, but do
  not pipe the dough. Divide the dough in half and place
  each half on a piece of parchment or wax paper. Shape
  the dough into a rough log about 1-inch diameter and
  about 6 inches long. Roll and tighten the paper around
  the dough, to make it perfectly cylindrical. Chill the
  cylinders of dough about 1 hour, until firm. Remove
  one piece at a time from the refrigerator and slice
  the cylinder into disks 1/4-inch thick. Arrange the
  disks of dough on paper-lined cookie sheets, 1 inch
  apart on all sides. Continue with the other cylinder
  of dough. Bake as for the Krumiri.

 Categories: Norwegian, Cookies, Desserts
      Yield: 28 Servings
 
      3    Eggs
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Butter
      1 ts Vanilla extract OR
    1/2 ts Almond extract
        ds Ground nutmeg
 
     In a medium mixing bowl beat eggs with an electric
  mixer on medium speed about 1 minute.  Add sugar; beat
  about 3 minutes or till sugar is almost dissolved.
  Melt butter; cool slightly.  Stir butter into egg
  mixture.  Add flour, vanilla or almond extract, and
  nutmeg; stir just till smooth.
     Heat a Krumkake iron on the range-top over
  medium-low heat.  For a 6-inch iron, spoon about 1
  Tablespoon of the batter onto the hot, ungreased iron.
  Close gently but firmly.  Cook over medium-low heat
  about 30 seconds or till light golden brown.  Turn
  iron and cook about 30 seconds more.  Open the iron
  carefully.  Loosen cookie with a narrow spatula;
  invert onto a wire rack.  Immediately roll the cookie
  into a cone or cylinder; using a wooden or metal form.
  Let cool around the cone or cylinder till the cookie
  holds its shape.
     Reheat the iron and repeat with remaining batter.
  Cool rolled cookies on a wire rack.  If desired,
  before serving, pipe or fill with whipped cream; top
  with chopped almonds or chocolate-flavored sprinkles,
  or serve with preserves if desired.  Makes 26-30
  cookies.

      Title: KRUMKAKER
 Categories: Norwegian, Desserts, Cookies
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 c  Sugar
      4    Eggs
    1/2 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Butter
  1 1/2 ts Ground cardamom
  1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
  2 1/2 ts Cornstarch
      3 tb Cold water
 
  Using a stationary or hand-held mixer, beat together
  the sugar, eggs, and vanilla until the mixture is
  light and airy.
  
  Melt the butter and let it cool.  Sift the cardamom
  and flour together. Mix the cornstarch and water until
  smooth. With the mixer on low speed, alternately add
  the butter and flour to the sugar-egg mixture. Beat in
  the cornstarch mixture.
  
  Pour a spoonful of batter on a heated krumkaker iron,
  press it shut, and bake the cookie until golden on
  each side. Drape around a cone or in a cup until dry.
  
  I like to serve these with whipped cream that has
  cloud berries (multebaer) whipped into it.   Realizing
  that cloud berries are hard to come by, my second
  choice would be raspberries.

  Chop potatoes in food processor (I do not have a food
  processor so I grate them on a cheese grater.. this
  works WONDERFUL)  The food processor tends to
  overprocess the potatoes.  Combine the potatoes with
  milk, eggs, crushed garlic, salt & pepper.  Pour the
  olive oil into a suitable baking dish and mix the
  potato mixture in with it. (make sure the oil is mixed
  in well). Bake at 400~ for 40 minutes. The thickness

  desired.  Accurate measuring of greens is not
  essential to success of this dish.
  
  Combine greens in a bowl.  Mix flour with 1 teaspoon
  salt and pepper to taste and sprinkle over greens,
  then toss well.  Beat eggs until frothy and pour over
  greens.  Stir well to combine and adjust seasoning.
  Heat butter in a 9-inch round casserole dish or deep
  cake pan in a moderate oven.  Swirl to coat sides and
  pour in egg mixture.
  
  Bake in a moderate oven, one shelf above center, for
  45-50 minutes until set and top is lightly browned.
  If insufficiently browned when set, place briefly
  under a hot grill.  Serve hot, cut in wedges, with
  yogurt and flat bread.  Also good served cold.  Serves

      Title: KUMARA FRITTERS - FRITURAS DE YAUTIA
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 kg Kumara
      2 tb Cornflour
      2 ts Baking powder
      2    Eggs
    100 ml Milk
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
           Olive oil for frying
 
  Because kumara is so moist, baking it before mashing
  as this recipe instructs yields the best result. But
  it is expensive and inefficient to run an oven to cook
  one or two sweet potatoes. If you are not baking
  anything else, steam the kumara, dry it well before
  mashing and add a little more cornflour if necessary.
  
  Bake 1 kg kumara until tender then mash when the
  kumara has cooled a little, sift in 2 tablespoons
  cornflour and 2 teaspoons baking powder and mix well.
  Add 2 eggs, beaten, 100 ml milk, teaspoon salt, half
  teaspoon nutmeg and mix again.
  
  Heat a little olive oil in a frying pan and drop the
  mixture into it by the heaped tablespoonful Fry until
  browned on both sides.
  
  Makes about 16

      Title: KUMARA PIE OR PUDDING
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
    600 g  Kumara
    300 ml Milk
    150 g  Brown sugar
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
      1 pn Ground cloves
      3 tb Rum
      2    Eggs
     60 g  Butter
 
  Traditionally this recipe from the American Deep South
  is used to fill a pie shell. But if you prefer, it is
  just as delicious if you skip the pastry and bake the
  filling in individual souffle pots standing in a bain
  marie (or one large one). The result has a rich
  complexity of flavour that belies how easy it is to
  make. A dollop of King Island cream or mascarpone on
  the side goes well.
  
  Steam 600 g kumara, peeled and cut into chunks. until
  tender. Place the cooked kumara in a food processor
  and add 300 ml milk, 150 g brown sugar, half teaspoon
  ground cinnamon, half teaspoon ground nutmeg, pinch
  ground cloves, 3 tablespoons rum, 2 eggs and 60 g
  melted butter. Process to a puree.
  
  Either: line a 23 cm pie dish with short or biscuit
  pastry and pour in the kumara puree, or pour the puree
  into individual souffle dishes (or one large one) and
  stand them in a baking dish containing water to come
  halfway up the sides of the dishes.
  
  Bake in a 220 C oven for 10 minutes, then reduce the
  heat to 150 C and bake until the puree is just firm,
  40 to 60 minutes. Do not overcook.

      Title: KUMQUATS IN BROWN SUGAR & VANILLA BEAN SYRU
 Categories: Side dish, Fruits, Vegetarian
      Yield: 3 Quarts
 
      4 c  Whole kumquats (25-30)
      2 c  Water
      1 c  Sugar
      1 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
      1 ea Vanilla bean
           -- halved lengthwise
 
  By cooking kumquats down with sugar and vanilla, the
  bitterness is removed from the rind and they become a
  tantalizing garnish or topping for sweet or savory
  dishes.
  
  Place the kumquats in a large saucepan and add water
  to cover. Bring to a full boil and, when foam begins
  to form on the surface, reduce the heat to medium.
  Continue to cook for 10 min more. Drain the kumquats
  and set aside.
  
  In the same saucepan over a high heat, bring the water
  to a gentle boil. Add the sugars, reduce the heat to
  medium, and stir constantly until the sugars have
  dissolved, about 3 min. Add the kumquats and vanilla
  bean and bring to a full boil. Reduce the heat to low
  and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally until the
  kumquats are transparent and soft, about 1 hour. Many
  of the kumquats will have burst and their skins will
  appear transparent.
  
  Spoon the kumquats and syrup into a clean jar, let
  cool, cover, and refrigerate. They will keep,
  refrigerated, for up to 2 weeks.

      Title: KUNG OP WUN SEN (BAKED PRAWNS & MUNGBEAN NO
 Categories: Thai, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Prawns
      5    Coriander roots, crushed
      1 tb Pepper corns
      1    Onion, thinly sliced
      3 sl Ginger, crushed
      2 tb Cooking oil
      1 tb Maggi sauce
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Oyster sauce
      2 tb Light soy sauce
      1 ts Sesame oil
      1 tb Whiskey
      2 c  Mungbean noodles, soaked
           -and cut into short lengths
 
  Here's a goody that came out of my new Thai cookbook.
  It's easy and quick to do and quite tasty.  It's a
  baked dish, which is unusual for Thai cooking.  I
  suspect that originally, it would have been steamed.
  Next time I'll try it that way or put a tablespoon of
  water or sherry in each bowl. It seemed a tad dry to
  me.  I cooked it in individual French onion soup bowls
  with lids.
  
  Place the oil in a wok, heat and stir fry the
  coriander root, ginger, pepper and onion.  When
  fragrant, remove from the wok and place in a mixing
  bowl.
  
  Add the noodles, the sauces. salt, sugar, sesame oil
  and whiskey, toss the noodles until well coated, and
  then add the prawns and toss well once again.
  
  Divide the noodles and prawns into four individual
  portions; place each portion in a lidded cup, and
  close the lids.  Place the cups on a baking tray and
  bake at 460F until the prawns are done (about 10
  minutes).
  
  Serve hot with fresh vegetables, such as tomatoes and
  spring onions. Serves four.

  If you can buy coriander bunches with the roots
  untrimmed you'll be in good shape.  If not, substitute
  stems.  I left it out as the person I was eating with
  doesn't like coriander at all.  It doesn't say to, but
  I cracked the peppercorns slightly before adding them
  to the mix.  By light soy sauce, they mean like in
  thin soy, rather than as in "lite" soy sauce.
  
  Maggi Sauce is a condiment sauce++originating in
  France, I believe++ popular in Asia.  It's somewhat
  like a slightly thick soy sauce.  It can be found in
  the gourmet sections of supermarkets as well as in
  Asian markets. If I didn't have any, I'd use thick
  Chinese soy in it's place. If you can find the Maggi
  Sauce grab it.  It lasts virtually forever in the
  fridge. Get a small bottle, though.  I run across very
  few recipes that call for it.  It's used as a table
  condiment in Asia and is often seen on the tables at
  Vietnamese restaurants here in the States.
  
  The mungbean noodles are the thin, clear "cellophane"
  noodles.  I'd have no qualms about using the similar
  thin rice noodles if I couldn't find mungbean ones.
  
  I picked up a neato garnish from the photo with this
  dish.  It shows a green onion "brush" with a slice of
  red pepper around the middle. Quite attractive and
  easy to make.  Cut a slice of scallion++the whitish
  part++about an inch and a half long.  Slice a fresh
  red chili into quarter-inch slices.  Take a length of
  scallion and push the seeds and pulp out of the chili
  slice.  Slip the rind down to the middle of the piece
  of scallion, then cut the exposed pieces of scallion
  with a thin, sharp blade all the way through.  Make
  two cuts vertically, then rotate the scallion and make
  two more cuts.  Do both ends, then toss the bundle
  into a bowl of water with lots of ice cubes and the
  slit ends will curl up making a nice, tassley looking
  garnish that's great to eat too.  The trick is to get
  chilies that are about the same diameter as the
  scallions so it's a snug fit. Just toss a couple of
  the chilly, frilly scallions into each bowl before
  serving.  It's a little touch, but it adds a lot to
  the appearance of the dish.

      Title: KUNG PAO (CHICKEN CHUNKS WITH PEANUTS IN SPIC
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Raw peanuts
      3 c  Peanut oil
      2    Whole chicken breasts at
           -room temp.
      1 lg Egg white
  1 1/2 tb Water chestnut flour
           SAUCE:
      4    Green onions
      2 lg Cloves garlic
      1 tb Minced ginger root
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 tb Sesame oil
    1/2 tb Chinese red vingear
    1/2 tb Dark soy sauce
  1 1/2 ts (level) chili paste with
           -garlic
      1 tb Dry sherry
      1 pn Sugar
           Cornstarch paste
 
  Preparation:  Trim ends off green onions and cut light
  green and white part into 1" sections.  Mix all other
  sauce ingredients in 2-quart saucepan. Reserve.
  
  Pull skin off breasts, then pull chicken meat from
  bones. Slice meat into 1" strips, then crosswise to
  make 1" chunks. In bowl large enough to hold chicken,
  add egg white to water chestnut flour. Beat mixture
  with a single chopstick (not an egg beater or whisk).
  Stir chicken pieces into egg mixture to coat
  thoroughly. Marinate 5 minutes. Note: water chestnut
  flour gives a lighter crust than cornstarch, though
  the latter may be substituted.
  
  Deep-frying:  Heat cooking oil in wok or deep-fryer to
  medium heat (you'll need more oil for deep-fryer). Fry
  peanuts until they are a light tan color; if a test
  peanut browns quickly, turn down heat. Remove peanuts
  with strainer or slotted spoon; drain on paper towel
  or paper bag. Reserve.
  
  Turn up heat slightly for chicken.  Test a chunk
  first: chicken should raise to surface immediately &
  brown in about 2 minutes. Deep-fry coated chicken
  chunks until golden brown. Deep-fry no more than 8
  chunks at a time.  Use long chopsticks or spatula to
  keep pieces separate while they are frying.  Remove
  with long chopsticks or slotted spoon. Reserve.
  
  Sauce:  While deep-frying chicken, heat sauce to
  simmer. Add green onions & peanuts about a minute
  before serving. At the last minute, add chicken pieces
  to sauce, mix quickly & serve.

    1/2 c  Peanuts
      1 ts Chopped Ginger
  1 1/2 tb Cornstarch In An Equal
           -Amount Of Water
      1 tb Soy Sauce

  Stir fry chicken for only about 1/2 minute; set aside.
  Discard the oil.
  
  Make up a seasoning sauce of 2T soy sauce, 1T white
  wine, 1 T sugar, 1 t. cornstarch, 1/2 t. salt, and 1
  t. sesame oil.
  
  In 2 T. oil, fry chiles till black, then add ginger
  and the chicken. Continue stirring, and add the

  low tolerance for heat, you might reduce by half your
  first time.

      Title: KUNG PAO CHICKEN - GUNGBAO CHICKEN
 Categories: Chinese, Chicken
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Chicken
      2 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 tb Rice wine
  2 1/2 oz Peanuts
      4    Scallions
      8    Dried chiles
      3 sl Ginger
      2 ts Sugar
      2 ts Sesame oil
           Oil for frying
 
  Dice the chicken: marinate for 30 minutes in 1 tb soy,
  the cornstarch and rice wine. Cut the scallions into 1
  in. pieces and the chiles in half (they are assuming
  you are using small ones).
  
  Heat the oil and deep fry the chicken dice for 2
  minutes. Drain well. Reheat the oil and fry peanuts
  for 3 minutes. Drain. Heat a pan with 3 TB of oil and
  stir fry ginger, scallions and chiles. And chicken
  dice and stir fry for another minute before stirring
  in 1 tb soy and the sugar. Adjust the seasonings and
  stir in the peanuts. Serve sprinkled with sesame oil.
  
  [Note: I believe this recipe assumes the use of raw
  peanuts. If you are using roasted peanuts, omit the
  deep fry.]
