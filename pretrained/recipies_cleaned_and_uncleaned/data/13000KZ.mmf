 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4    (4-6 oz's. each) Alaska
           -halibut steaks, thawed if
           -necessary
    1/2 c  Peanut butter
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
    1/4 c  Lime or lemon juice
      2 tb Honey
      1 c  Crushed corn flakes
 
  Mixing well-loved flavors such as peanut butter with less familiar
  flavors such as fish makes fish more acceptable to children.
  Marinating the halibut for 4-6 hours before cooking enhances the
  peanut flavor without adding work. Alaska halibut is a mild flavored
  whitefish with a firm, meaty texture that appeals to all ages.
  
  Cut center bone and skin from halibut steaks and cut into 1-inch
  chunks. Place peanut butter, soy sauce, lime juice and honey in
  blender. Blend until smooth. The mixture should be thick. Place
  peanut butter mixture in a glass dish and roll each halibut chunk in
  mixture, evenly coating all sides. Then roll halibut chunks in
  crushed corn flakes to coat. Place on a greased baking sheet and bake
  in upper half of oven at 450" for 3-5 minutes, or until fish just
  flakes when tested with a fork. Makes 4-6 From the files of Al Rice,

 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 2 Pounds
 
      2 c  Sugar
      1 c  Milk
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Marshmallow creme
    1/2 c  Peanut butter
 
  Peanut Butter Fudge:  Grease 8 by 8 inch baking pan; set aside. Into
  a 6 quart heavy saucepan, measure sugar, milk and salt. Over medium
  heat heat to boiling, stirring constantly.
  
  With candy thermometer in place, cook, without stirring, until
  temperature reaches 235 F or soft ball stage (when a small amount of
  mixture dropped into very cold water forms a ball which flattens on
  removal from water). Remove saucepan from heat.
  
  Without stirring, allow mixture to cool to 110 F or lukewarm, about 45
  minutes (bottom of pan will feel comfortably warm).
  
  Stir in marshmallow creme and peanut butter. With a wooden spoon, beat
  mixture until it holds its shape and loses some of its gloss, about 5
  to 7 minutes. Turn fudge into prepared pan. Allow fudge to set, about
  30 minutes.

      Title: PEANUT NOODLES
 Categories: Pasta, Entrees
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Chinese-style noodles,
           -fresh
    1/2 tb Garlic chili paste
      2 tb Peanut butter, good
           -(without added sugar)
      1 tb Nam pla (fermented
           -fish sauce)
    1/2 c  Water
      2    Scallion stalks, chopped
 
  Boil a lot of water for the noodles; this is the most time-consuming
  step.
  
  Rinse and trim scallions, then slice thinly.  In a small mixing bowl,
  combine peanut butter and chili paste with a fork. Mix thoroughly. Add
  water to the peanut mixture. This is tricky, since peanut butter and
  water do not want to mix. Start with a tiny bit of water, mix
  thoroughly until it is homogeneous, and then add some more water. You
  can begin to add larger quantities of water as the sauce gets
  thinner. The water and peanut butter really will mix, if you are
  patient.
  
  Continue adding water until the sauce has the consistency you want; I
  make it about the consistency of ketchup. Stir in the nam pla.
  
  Once the pot of water is boiling, cook the noodles until they are just
  done, and not mushy. Drain noodles and immediately mix in the sauce.
  Toss until the noodles are evenly coated. Garnish with scallions and
  serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chinese-style noodles with a spicy peanut sauce -- This recipe is
  not authentic Chinese; it was created by combining readily available
  ingredients and double-checking against a Satay recipe. It's close to
  a Satay sauce, but not quite the same thing. It's also similar to a
  recipe in "The Enchanted Broccoli Forest," by Mollie Katzen.
  
  *  The ingredients are readily available at oriental grocery stores.
  Substitute soy sauce if you can't find nam pla. For fresh noodles,
  you can substitute several packages of ramen noodles, discarding
  sauce powders.
  
  *  This basic recipe may be varied by modifying quantities. Vary the
  chili paste to control hotness, and the nam pla to control saltiness
  (but the sauce will taste saltier before mixing with the noodles). If
  you use this as the main dish of a meal, it serves only two. This
  will keep for at least a week in the refrigerator.
  
  *  Serve with a good beer; it's too spicy for most wines.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes, plus waiting for the water to boil.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      1 pn Salt
    1/2 c  Minced cilantro leaves
 
  Heat the peanut oil to nearly smoking in a saucepan. Turn off the
  heat and add the peanuts. The peanuts should cook to a golden brown
  in 3-5 minutes. If you burn them, throw them out and start all over
  again or your sauce will be bitter. You may have to turn on the heat
  again, but stir the peanuts if you do. Using a slotted spoon,
  transfer the peanuts to the container of a food processor or blender,
  along with 1 T of the peanut oil (reserve the rest) and blend them to
  a rough paste. Add the chiles, ginger, garlic and continue to blend.
  Add the remaining ingredients except the cilantro, and blend until
  smooth. If it is too thick, add more oil. Stir in cilantro, and serve
  with satay.

      1 pt Shelled peanuts
      1 c  Milk
 
  This is from an old, old book put out for British settlers in

  over the weekend.
  
  Dry peanuts in the oven until the skin can be rubbed off and the nuts
  are a deep biscuit in colour.  Crush with a rolling pin, or mince, to
  a very fine meal. Strain the stock and simmer with the nut meal for
  1/2 hour or more. Season to taste.  Before serving, stir in milk, or
  even better, 1/2 small tin unsweetened condensed milk, add a little
  butter and serve.

      Title: PEANUT STUFFED CHICKEN BREAST
 Categories: Poultry, Microwave, Crockpot
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     12    Chicken breasts, boned
    1/2 c  Peanut butter
    1/8 c  Honey
      1 ts Cumin
      1 tb Mint, dried
      1 pk G. Washington's Golden
           -bouillon mix
 
  Bone chicken breasts if needed, keeping meat as nearly intact as
  possible. (It's much easier to rip the meat off the bones than any
  knifework I've tried to date.) Pull off shreds and gobbets. Put
  peanut butter, honey, cumin and mint in a bowl and mix well.
  Microwaving for 30 seconds or so thins it and makes it much easier to
  mix. Spread about 2 tsp of the peanut butter mix in a thin layer over
  each piece of breast meat. Place 1/12 of the shreds and gobbets on
  the breast and roll them up into a packet. Tie the packet shut with
  butcher's twine or fasten with a toothpick. Arrange the twelve
  packets in layers in the crock pot, being careful not to let any fall
  open. Stir water in to the bowl with any remaining peanut butter and
  mix well. Add the packet of bouillon and pour over the chicken
  packets. Add water as needed to cover packets to a depth of at least
  one inch. Turn crock pot on high for 5 or 6 hours. Remove packets
  from pot and let drain on a platter. All the chicken fat will have
  migrated to the top of the liquid, which I suspect would probably
  make a wonderful flavoring for soups and other dishes.

MMMMM-----------------BEST BREAD MACHINE CB EVER----------------------
  1 1/2 lg Pears
      3 tb Oil
    1/2 tb Yeast
      2 c  Bread flour
  1 1/8 c  Rye flour
      3 tb Wheat germ
      3 tb Sugar
    1/2 tb Salt
    1/2 tb Fennel seeds
      3 tb Hazelnuts, chopped
    1/2 c  Water; warm
 
  Bring all ingredients to room temperature and pour into bakery, in
  order. Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white bread" and
  push Start. In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.
  
  Ripe, actually overripe, pears make the sweetest, moistest bread. This
  subtly flavored loaf does fine on its own and makes excellent plain,
  cinnamon, or French toast. Or place a thin slice of cold cooked lamb
  on it and briefly warm in the broiler.

        1 lb Puff Pastry
  
  Pears: Place the pears, sugar, lemon juice, salt, and cinnamon in a
  large saute pan. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally,
  until the pears are soft and most of the liquid has evaporated, 10 to
  
       15    minutes. Let cool.
  
  Pecan Paste: In a food processor, finely grind the pecans and
  granulated sugar. Place the pecan mixture in a small bowl and add the
  water, orange zest, and salt. Mix just until combined.
  
  Puff Pastry: On a lightly floured work surface, roll the piece of puff
  pastry into a 16-inch square. Cut into 4 rectangles, each 4 inches
  wide by 16 inches long. With a fork, pierce small holes all over the
  pastry. Place the rectangles on two baking sheets. Freeze or
  refrigerate until firm.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
  
  Place a second baking sheet or an inverted wire mesh rack on top of
  the puff pastry to prevent it from rising as it bakes. Bake until
  golden brown, 10-15 minutes. Cool to room temperature.
  
  Assembly: Spread 1/3 of the pecan paste on one of the rectangles of
  puff pastry. Carefully layer 1/3 of the pears over the pecan paste.
  Layer two more pieces of pastry with the remaining pecan paste and
  pears in the same manner. Using a wide metal spatula, carefully stack
  these three pieces of pastry.
  
  In a small bowl mix together the sugar and the cinnamon. Dust the
  fourth piece of puff pastry with the cinnamon sugar and place it on
  top of the stacked layers of pastry.
  
  Using a serrated knife and a gentle sawing motion, trim the edges of
  the napoleon so that they are even. In the same manner, cut the
  napoleon into 8 pieces and serve a portion on each of 8 plates.

 Categories: Desserts, Fruits
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
     32 oz Pear slices in light or
           -heavy syrup*
      2 tb Pear liqueur; or to taste*
      1 ts Lemon Juice

MMMMM----------------------MERINGUE SHELLS---------------------------
           Butter, unsalted; for baking
           -sheets
           Flour; for baking sheets
      4    Egg Whites; room temp
    1/2 ts Cream of tartar
      1 pn Salt
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract

MMMMM----------------------RASPBERRY SAUCE---------------------------
     10 oz Raspberries, frozen; thawed
      2 tb Sugar, superfine
    1/2 ts Cornstarch
      1 ts Lemon juice; or lime juice
 
  *   This sorbet, based simply on commercially canned pears, can be
  :      enhanced with the flavor of eau-de-vie de poire (pear liqueur)
  or, :      if preferred, with fresh lemon juice. Pears in heavy syrup
  make a :      smooth-textured sorbet; pears in light syrup yield a
  grainier or :      icier sorbet.
  
  One day before serving, place cans of pears in coldest part of
  freezer. Freeze until completely frozen, at least 6 hours. Rinse cans
  briefly under warm water. Open each can at both ends, leaving bottom
  of can in place. Push the frozen pears and syrup into a large bowl.
  Let stand just until softened enough to break frozen mass easily into
  3 or 4 pieces, about 15 minutes.  Remove to food processor.
  
  Process pear mixture, using repeated on/off motion, until slushy. Add
  liqueur and lemon juice; process until blended. Spoon into freezer
  container.  Freeze, tightly covered, until sorbet is solid and flavors
  mellow, at least 3 hours.
  
  Meringues:  Butter 2 large baking sheets; dust with flour and shake
  off excess. Using a 4-inch cardboard template or saucer and the point
  of a wooden skewer or pick, outline four 4-inch circles, even spaced,
  on each baking sheet. Set aside.
  
  Heat oven to 200F.
  
  Beat egg whites, cream of tartar, and salt in large bowl on medium
  speed until stiff but not dry.  Beat in 2/3 cup of the sugar, 1
  tablespoon at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition; beat in
  vanilla; then continue to beat until whites are very stiff and shiny.
  If mixture feels grainy when small amount is rubbed between your two
  fingers, sugar is not dissolved completely, and mixture must be
  beaten a little longer. Fold in remaining sugar gently but thoroughly.
  
  Spoon meringue gently into large pastry bag fitted with 1/2-inch
  fluted tip; fill in traced circles on baking sheets, starting at
  center of each circle and working to outside edge, in even spiral.
  When all circles are filled, pipe a standing rim around circumference
  of each circle.
  
  Bake meringue shells until dry and very pale beige, 2 to 2-1/2 hours.
  Turn off oven; let meringues stand in oven with door closed 2 hours.
  
  Remove baking sheets to wire racks; let meringues stand 15 minutes;
  then carefully loosen them with wide flat metal spatula and transfer
  to wire racks.  Let cool completely. Use immediately or store loosely
  covered at room temperature up to 3 days.
  
  Sauce:  Puree raspberries in food processor; press through sieve and
  discard seeds.  Mix sugar and cornstarch in small saucepan; stir in
  raspberry puree gradually; stir until thoroughly blended. Heat over
  low heat, stirring constantly, until sauce boils and thickens. Remove
  from heat. Refrigerate until very cold, at least 2 hours. Stir in
  lemon juice before serving.
  
  Scoop generous portions of sorbet into meringue shells. Pour raspberry
  sauce over each serving. Serve immediately.

      1    10-inch circle frozen puff
           -pastry rolled 1/8-inch
           -thick
           -OR  the same amount of pie
           -dough
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      5    (approx) med Bosc or Winter
           -Nelis pears; ripe and
           -juicy,  but firm
      1 tb Rum, Cognac, brandy or
           -Armagnac (optional)
 
  Melt butter in a 9-inch black iron frying pan over medium heat and
  immediately add sugar, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Cook
  until it is golden caramel in color but be sure to remove the pan
  from the heat before the caramel  is too dark, as it will continue
  cooking from the pan heat.
  
  Cut the pears in half lengthwise, core and peel them, and gently toss
  the pears with the liqueur of your choice if used. Arrange the pears
  in the caramel rounded side down and pointed end towards the center.
  
  Cut four or five 1-inch slits in the center of the pastry to allow
  steam to escape, and lay it over the top of the pears. If you're
  using frozen pastry let it defrost first <G>. Push the pastry down
  between the pears and the sides of the  pan.  This will make a nice,
  wavy edge as the pastry conforms to the shape of the pears.
  
  Set the tart in the middle of a preheated 400 deg F oven and bake for
  about 30 minutes, or until the pears are tender and the crust is
  browned and baked through. Remove from the oven, let stand for a
  minute and then invert a serving  platter over the top of the pan.
  Lift the two together, holding the platter as tight as you can
  against the baking pan, and flip it over quickly so the juice doesn't
  splatter. If a lot of the caramel has run off, spoon it back over the
  pears.
  
  Serve with vanilla ice cream or creme fraiche - serves 8

      2    Strips of lemon zest
           -(1" x 2" each)
      2 tb Freshly squeezed lemon juice
      3 lg Ripe pears
           -(Bosc, if possible)
    1/2 c  Whole blanched almonds
      2 c  Milk
      1    2" piece of vanilla bean
      2    Eggs

      6 tb Butter; in 1/2-in bits
    1/2 c  Dry or stale macaroons
           - pulverized
    1/2 c  Kirsch
  1 1/2 c  Apricot jam
    1/4 c  Kirsch
      3 tb Finely chopped pistachios
           - (blanched)
 
  IN A MEDIUM-SIZE, NON-REACTIVE saucepan, combine the 1 1/2 cups
  sugar, the split vanilla bean, lemon zest, lemon juice and 4 cups
  water. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring, until
  the sugar is dissolved and the syrup is clear. Peel the pears, cut in

  peach-like round by cutting off the stem end. Poach the pear halves
  in the sugar syrup until tender. Drain on a rack. Preheat oven to
  350F. On a baking sheet, toast the almonds to golden brown, cool and
  pulverize in a food processor. Heat the milk with the remaining
  2-inch piece of vanilla bean. Meanwhile, beat the eggs, yolks and 3/4
  cup sugar until thick and lemon colored, then add the flour. When the
  flour is absorbed, add the milk, return to the heat, stirring, and
  cook 3-5 minutes, or until nicely thickened. Pour pastry cream into a
  bowl and stir in the 6 tablespoons of butter. Add the almond powder,
  macaroons, and 1/2 cup kirsch. Allow to cool to room temperature,
  stirring occasionally; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate to
  chill. Heat the apricot jam, then rub through a fine sieve and add
  the 1/4 cup kirsch. Heat again and stir constantly until clear.
  Spread a thin layer of apricot glaze on bottom of the baked and
  cooled pastry shell. Spoon in the frangipane (almond pastry cream)
  and smooth it out. Set the pear round in the center and arrange
  around it the pear halves, stem end facing center. Press pears gently
  into the frangipane. Brush the apricot glaze over the pears; mix the
  pistachios and sprinkle over the pears. Refrigerate until 15 minutes
  before serving. (Can be made 1 day in advance.)

      Title: PEAR TARTS WITH CARAMEL SAUCE
 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Almond Cream:
    1/4 c  Unsalted butter,, softened
    1/3 c  Super fine sugar
      2 lg Egg yolks
    1/4 ts Amaretto or almond extract
      1 c  Ground almonds, (see note)
      1 tb Allpurpose flour
           Caramel Sauce:
    1/2 c  Brown sugar,, packed
      4 tb Unsalted butter
      2 tb Heavy cream
           Tarts:
      1 lb Puff pastry
      2 lg Ripe pears, peeled, cored,,
           -thinly sliced
      1    Egg yolk
      4    Sprigs mint
           Confectioners sugar,, for
           -serving
 
  To make the almond cream: In the bowl of an electric mixer or with a
  wooden spoon, beat the butter and sugar together until light and
  fluffy. Add the egg yolks, beat in well, and add the Amaretto. Stir
  in the ground almonds and flour until evenly mixed. The mixture
  should be the consistency of a thick paste.
  
  To make the caramel sauce: In a small sauce pan, combine the brown
  sugar, butter and cream. Bring the mixture to a boil and boil
  vigorously for 2 minutes, remove from the heat. Cover and keep warm
  at the back of the stove.
  
  To make the tarts: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. On a lightly
  floured surface, roll out the pastry to a 1/8inch thickness and,
  using a plate or cardboard circle as a template, use a very sharp
  knife to cut four 7inch circles. Spread a circle of almond cream in
  the center of each, leaving a 1inch border. Fan the sliced pears out
  from the center of each tart, completely covering the almond cream
  but still leaving the border. Beat the egg yolk lightly with a fork
  and brush the border of the pastry with it (try not to let any yolk
  dribble down onto the cut edges of the pastry, otherwise it will not
  rise as high). Bake the tarts for about 20 minutes, until the edges
  are golden and the pastry is baked through. Remove from the oven and
  allow to cool for 5 minutes Place a sprig of mint in the center of
  each tart and sprinkle it with a little confectioners sugar. Serve
  warm, drizzled with the warm caramel sauce.
  
  Yield: 4 servings
  
  Note: to make ground almonds, freeze whole or sliced blanched
  almonds, then process them in a blender in short bursts, scraping
  down the sides as necessary, until they are evenly ground. Do not
  over process or allow them to get warm, otherwise they will turn into
  nut butter.

      Title: PEAR-AND-APRICOT TART
 Categories: Pies, Desserts, Fruits/nuts
      Yield: 14 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------FOR THE ALMOND PASTRY------------------------
      3 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
     18 tb Unsalted butter; chilled
           - cut into small pieces
      2    Eggs
      1 tb Milk
      2 ts Vanilla extract
      4 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Finely chopped almonds
           Flour

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE FILLING---------------------------
      3    7-oz tubes almond paste
      2    Eggs
      2 tb Amaretto liquor
     14    Canned pear halves, in juice
           -OR in extra light syrup
           - drained or blotted dry
     14    Canned apricot halves
           - in extra-light syrup or
           - juice, drained
           - and blotted dry
    1/2 c  Apple jelly
      8 oz Low-fat vanilla yogurt
      4 oz Sour cream
 
  MAKE THE CRUST: Combine the flour, butter, eggs, milk and vanilla in
  the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel chopping blade. With
  an on-off motion, process until the butter is the size of small peas.
  Add the sugar, salt and almonds and process just until the dough
  starts to pull together. Do not overprocess. Remove the dough from
  the bowl, pat it into a ball, then flatten it into a disk about
  3/4-inch thick, and dust with flour. Cover with plastic wrap and
  refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Preheat oven to 375F. Remove the
  dough from the refrigerator and gently massage it until it is
  workable, turning it over a couple of times, and starting to flatten
  it with your fingertips. Dust the dough, rolling pin and board or
  pastry cloth with flour, and quickly roll dough into a rectangle
  large enough to fit into an 11-by-17-inch jelly roll pan and about
  1/8-inch thick. If the dough sticks, add small amounts of flour and
  loosen with a dough scraper or long, thin-bladed knife. Carefully
  roll the dough over the pin or fold it into quarters and position it
  over the pan. Unroll, and ease the dough into the tart pan, working
  to flatten the bottom and to ease the dough well into the corners and
  against the sides. Patch where necessary, then trim off any excess
  dough with a knife. Prick in several places, and transfer the pan to
  the middle of the preheated oven to bake just until the pastry is set
  but not browned, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the pan and let the
  pastry cool while preparing the filling.
  
  FILL THE TART: In a medium-size bowl, combine the almond paste, eggs
  and amaretto, beating with an electric mixer until smooth. Scrape the
  mixture into the crust, and spread it evenly with a metal spatula.
  With a sharp, thin-bladed knife, cut across each pear half at
  1/4-inch intervals. You should end up with about 7 slices. Beginning
  at the left edge of 1 long side, place the wide end of the pear
  touching the side of the pan, pressing gently to elongate it. Put an
  apricot half at the narrow end. Next, place an apricot touching the
  side of the pan, to the right of the first pear, and add a sliced
  pear with the narrow end touching the apricot. Continue until the
  whole side is filled with 7 pear halves and 7 apricot halves. Repeat
  the same procedure for the second half of the tart, continuing with
  the pears facing in the same direction as they do in the first row.
  Return the pan to the oven, and bake until the almond paste is light
  brown and the crust is a rich brown, about 15 to 18 minutes. While
  the tart is baking, melt the jelly over low heat. Remove the baked
  tart, brush on the jelly glaze, and let the tart cool to room
  temperature. Cut the tart into serving size portions of an apricot
  and pear on each slice. Combine the yogurt with the sour cream and
  spoon it over the tart as it is served.

      Title: PEARS - HALVED
 Categories: Fruits, Canning
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
 
  Quantity: An average of 17-1/2 pounds is needed per canner load of 7
  quarts; an average of 11 pounds is needed per canner load of 9 pints.
  A bushel weighs 50 pounds and yields 16 to 25 quarts--an average of
  2-1/2 pounds per quart.
  
  Quality: Choose ripe, mature fruit of ideal quality for eating fresh
  or cooking.
  
  Procedure: Wash and peel pears. Cut lengthwise in halves and remove
  core. A melon baller or metal measuring spoon is suitable for coring
  pears. To prevent discoloration, keep pears in an ascorbic acid
  solution. Prepare a very light, light, or medium syrup or pack pears
  in apple juice, white grape juice, or water. Raw packs make poor
  quality pears. Boil drained pears 5 minutes in syrup, juice, or
  water. Fill jars with hot fruit and cooking liquid, leaving 1/2-inch
  headspace. Adjust lids and process. Processing directions for canning
  pears in a boiling-water, a dial, or a weighted-gauge canner are
  given in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.

  some of the Creme de Cacao, or Creme de Menthe.

 Categories: Desserts, Fruits, Vegan
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2 lg Pears; peeled & left whole
     25 g  Butter
           - cut into small pieces
      1    Glass of red wine
     40 g  Caster sugar
      1    Cinnamon stick, 2.5 cm
    100 g  Bilberries (or blueberries)
           Crme fraiche (Vegans omit)
 
  Poaching pears in a slow oven transforms them completely, and although
  cooked through until soft, they do not lose their firm, grainy
  texture. A little cinnamon and red wine flavour the sauce, and the
  bilberries are an inspired touch.
  
  Arrange the pears in an ovenproof dish. Add the butter, red wine,
  sugar, cinnamon stick and bilberries or blueberries.
  
  Bake at 200 degrees C / 400 degrees F / gas 6 for 1 hour, covered
  with foil and basting every 10 minutes. Serve hot or warm, with crme

      Title: PEARS WITH CREAMY RICE PUDDING OLD DUTCH STYL
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------PEARS--------------------------------
      4    Cooking pears
    1/2 l  Water
     40 g  Sugar
      1 ts Vinegar
      1    Stick of cinnamon (*)
           Piece of lemon peel (just
           -the yellow part, the
           -white is too bitter)
      1 ts Potato-flour (or other kind
           -to thicken the juice that
           -keeps it clear)

MMMMM----------------------------RICE---------------------------------
  2 1/2 dl Milk
      2 tb Rice (the type to make
           -rice-milk)
      1    Grated peel of 1 melon
           -again, just the yellow bit
      2    Sheets of gelatine (*)
      1 tb Vanilla flavoured sugar (*)
      2 tb Sugar
    1/8 l  Whipping cream
 
  Peel the pears, leave the stem on (looks nice). In a pan, bring the
  water, pears, cinnamon and lemon peel to a boil. Stew for 3 1/2
  hours. Bring back to a boil. Put the potato-flour in a cup and add a
  little water, stir. Stir it bit by bit into the boiling pear stuff
  until set to the thickness of sauce. Let boil for another few
  minutes. (Remove the cinnamon stick if you prefer). Put rice, milk
  and lemon grating into pan and boil for 30 minutes. Soak the gelatine
  in a generous amount of (cold!) water for 10 minutes until soft.
  Squeeze the water out of the gelatine and add the gelatine to the
  rice mixture (TAKE THE PAN AWAY FROM THE STOVE). Don't boil it again!
  The gelatine will not set and it tastes yukky. Add the vanilla sugar
  and the regular sugar. Let it cool down. Whip the cream until stiff.
  Work the cream into the rice mixture carefully using 2 large spoons.
  Cool again.
  
  Serving suggestion: Reheat the pears until just warm. Serve them on
  the side with the rice pudding. Pour some of the pear juice over the
  pudding. Enjoy!
  
  (*) Stick of cinnamon: you *could* replace it with powder, but it
    won't taste the same (*) In the Netherlands we use sheets of
  gelatine. If you add up the
    volumes of the ingredients i'm sure you can work out how much
    clear (no taste) gelatine powder of your own you should use. (*) If
  you don't have vanilla flavoured sugar, use regular and add
    some vanilla flavouring. Or even better: add a cut-open vanilla
    pod to the rice mixture while cooking. Scrape out the black centre
    and add to the pudding after cooking.
  
  IMHO this recipe seems very little for 4 servings. The rice pudding
  can be rather heavy though. If you make it for visitors, just make
  sure to make a double portion, just in case they want seconds! And
  rice pudding is even better the next day. Cooking pears can also be
  eaten cold.

     12    Sprigs fresh mint
 
   Cut each pear lengthwise into quarters. Using amelon baller or
  grapefruit spoo, create a well in the center of each quarter. If
  pears are very small, consider using halves instead of quarters.
  
   In a small bowl, prepare chutney by mixing together lime juice and
  zest, red pepper, garlic, soy sauce, brown sugar and peanuts. Spoon
  chutney in hollowed out section of pear quarters. Add a sprig of mint
  for garnish. Place on a serving tray. Makes 12 appetizers.
  
   Helpful hint: Chutney can be prepared up to a week in advance. To
  avoid browning, cut pears no earlier than a few hours before serving;
  then sprinkle with lime juice.

      1 c  Dates; chopped

      1 tb Flour

      2    Eggs; separated
           Whipped cream
 
  This very sweet dessert was a favorite of former Canadian Prime
  Minister and Noble Prize winner, Lester "Mike" Pearson. "Perhaps for
  sound political reasons, no member of the household staff (of the
  Prime Minister's residence) can remember any specific occasion on
  which it was served."
  
  Anne' s note: I chopped the dates in a food processor with the 1 Tbsp
  of flour (to prevent stickiness) and then added 1 tsp of flour to the
  mixture.
  
  Blend the ingredients (except the eggs) lightly with a fork. Add
  unbeaten egg yolks and stir lightly. Fold in stiffly beaten egg
  whites. Pour in buttered baking dish and set in a larger pan
  partially filled with hot water. Bake at 325F until it becomes light
  brown (20-25 minutes). Serve cold with whipped cream. SERVES: 6

  Hi Everyone: I really like "one pot" recipes and this one from the LA
  Times, issued 3/l2/92 really fits that for me. Now, if I could just
  get rid of the "pot" I carry around my waist, we would be in business!
  :) :) This recipe is by Fatima Lakhani, author of "Indian Recipes for
  a Healthy Heart." Combine tomatoes, peas, yogurt, garlic, ginger,
  coriander, cumin, garam masala, l/2 tsp. salt, and turmeric in bowl.
  Heat canola oil in large saucepan.  Add onion, green chiles, cinnamon
  sticks, peppercorns and cumin seeds and saute until onion starts to
  turn golden. Add tomato mixture and stir. Cover and cook over medium
  heat l0 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add water, remaining 3/4
  tsp. salt, potatoes and cilantro. Stir well, cover and bring to boil.
  Add rice, stir gently and cook, covered, until almost all the water
  has been absorbed, about l0 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook l0
  to l5 minutes, or until rice is tender.

  "bite" of the raw onion. If so, sprinkle the minced onions with salt
  and let them sit for a few minutes. Then press them gently in a sieve
  and rinse them well in running water. This sauce will keep,
  refrigerated for three or four days. Pebre is a perfect complement to
  any Chilean main dish.

 Categories: Burma, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Chinese tofu cake
      3 tb Corn OR peanut oil
      1 sm Onion, sliced (1/4 cup)
      1 sm Rutabaga, peeled, cut into
           -1/4-inch-thick
           Slices (2/3 cup)
    1/4 c  Chopped ripe tomato, fresh
           -or canned
      1 ts Thin-sliced fresh hot green
           -chili
      2 ts Soy sauce
    1/4 ts Ground cuminseed
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Water
 
  1.  Cut the tofu into 5 rectangles about 1 inch wide, 2 inches long
  and 1/4 inch thick.  Dry them well on paper towels.
  
  2.  Heat a dry skillet for 1 minute, then add the oil (this prevents
  the tofu fromn sticking).  Fry the tofu over moderate heat to a
  light-brown on both sides. Remove and set aside. Remove all but 1
  tablespoon oil.
  
  3.  Brown the onion in the oil over moderate heat for 2 minutes. Add
  the rutabaga slices and stir fry for 2 minutes. Add the tomato,
  chili, soy sauce, cuminseed, and salt and stir fry for 1 minute. Add
  the water, cover the skillet, and cook for 5 minutes.
  
  4.  Add the tofu, stir for a moment, cover the skillet, and cook for 3
  minutes more.
  
  Serve warm with bread.  An excellent side dish for vegetarians.
  
  Note:  Firm vegetables such as chayote and the white turnip with a
  mauve top can also be used in this preparation. The contrast of the
  browned tofu and the soft turnip is pleasant to the palate, and the
  flavorings give it an unusual and distinctive character.

  pecans between two small baking pans (such as 9-inch cake pans),
  evenly spreading 1 1/2 cups in each. Bake until golden (about 15
  minutes). Turn off oven, but leave pans inside to keep nuts warm. Put
  butter in heavy 2-quart saucepan. Cook over low heat until melted.
  Stir in sugar, water, and corn syrup. Increase flame to medium-high.
  Cook, stirring constantly with wooden spoon, until sugar has
  dissolved and mixture comes to a boil (4 - 5 minutes). Insert candy
  thermometer. Continue boiling at moderate,s teady rate, stirring
  almost constantly, until thermometer reaches 300 degrees F. (hard
  crack stage). (Total cooking time will be approximately 20 minutes.)
  IMMEDIATELY turn off flame under pot. QUICKLY stir in salt and 1 1/2
  cups (contents of one pan) pecans. Pour into foil-lined pan, using
  wooden spoon to spread mixture to edges. In top of double boiler
  (over simmering water), melt chocolate. Turn off flame. Quickly
  spread one-half of the melted chocolate over the cooled toffee.
  Evenly sprinkle with one-half of the remaining pecans. Pat down with
  spatula. Cover pan with waxed paper. Top with inverted cookie sheet.
  Carefully invert. Peel off foil. Spread toffee with remaining melted
  chocolate. Sprinkle with remaining nuts. Pat down with spatula.
  Refrigerate until firm. Break into bite-sized pieces. Store in

 Categories: Breads, Desserts
      Yield: 12 Servings

      1 tb Sugar
      1 c  Lukewarm water
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Milk
      6 tb Oil
    1/2 c  Sugar
      3    Eggs
      7 c  Flour
      1    Brown sugar
      1    Light karo syrup
      1    Chopped walnuts or pecans
 
  Put yeast and 1 tbl sugar and water in a large bowl. Set aside. Scald
  the milk, take off heat.  Add oil, 1/2 cup sugar, salt and cool to
  lukewarm.
  In a separate bowl, mix eggs and milk mixture.  Slowly add flour.
  Knead lightly, place in a lightly greased bowl and let rise until
  double in size. Punch down, take about 1/3 of the dough and roll to
  about 1/4" thick. Spread with the following...
  Melted butter, sprinkle with white sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon.
  Roll dough and cut about 1" thick.  Put in *Prepared Pans*
  (directions to follow).  Cover and let rise until double in size.
  Bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes.  Let stand for about 1 minute, loosen
  rolls from the sides of the pan and turn out on wax paper to cool.

  are best when warm.)
  ***** Prepared pans:  Lightly grease bottom and sides of pan. Put a
  thin layer of brown sugar on bottom, chopped walnuts or pecans also.
  Lightly drizzle melted butter over the sugar and nuts, then lightly
  drizzle white karo syrup over the mixture.  If you add too much brown
  sugar, butter and syrup all the "sticky" will run off when cooling.
  You have to experiment a little to see how much to add to your liking.

  firm ball stage (240-250 degrees F.), stirring only if it starts to
  burn.
   Remove from the heat and immediately place the pot in a larger pot
  filled with cold water; this will stop the cooking process and bring
  the temperature down.
   Drop in the butter and let cool slightly, without stirring. beat
  until it starts to thicken, add the vanilla and the pecans and
  continue to beat until the candy loses some of its gloss. Spread
  evenly in the pan and mark into squares.  When firm, cut into pieces

      Title: PECAN PRALINES
 Categories: Candies, Southwest
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 c  Milk
      1 c  Sugar, granulated
      1 c  Dark brown sugar,
           -firmly packed
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      3 tb Corn syrup, dark
      8 oz Pecan halves
    3/4 c  Water, boiling
     24    Cupcake papers
 
  Place the white sugar, brown sugar, milk and corn syrup in a heavy
  about 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir to thoroughly
  dissolve.
  
  Measuring the temperature with a candy thermometer, stir constantly
  with a long-handled wooden spoon. When the mixture reaches "jelly"
  temperature on the thermometer (220 degrees), it will bubble
  furiously. Splattering is a danger (this is why you want a spoon with
  a long handle). You may wish to wear heavy rubber gloves for further
  protection. Continue stirring until mixture reaches 256 degrees
  ("medium-ball" stage).
  
  Remove from heat, add vanilla and let it sit for 10 minutes. During
  this time, set out the cupcake papers on the countertop and place 3-4
  pecan halves in each paper.
  
  Beat the mixture by hand with the wooden spoon, while it is still in
  the pan, until it loses its glossy sheen. This can take up to 10
  minutes or more, and calls for a strong arm.
  
  At this point, the mixture will very quickly begin to form lumps and
  harden in the pan. As this begins to happen, return the pan to low
  heat; add boiling hot water a tablespoon at a time, and beat out the
  lumps until nearly all are gone. Add just enough water so that the
  mixture is somewhat runny and has lost much of its previous lumpy
  consistency (no more than about
     3/4 cup of water, and often much less.) Leaving a few lumps is
  permissible and often unavoidable.
  
  Remove from heat and spoon it into the cupcake papers. Let it harden
  for 20-30 minutes, then remove papers. Be sure not to let the papers
  remain on after the candy has hardened somewhat or they will be
  difficult to remove later.
  
  Store the pralines in an airtight container.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *   Texas-style creamy pecan cookies -- My family is from Texas, and
  we dearly love "authentic" Mexican food. Authentic as defined by my
  father: home-style Tex-Mex. (On a trip to Acapulco, he complained
  that he couldn't find any real Mexican food in the whole damn town.)
  
  We feel that the perfect ending to an orgy of tacos, enchiladas,
  tamales, beans, rice and Dos Equis beer is pralines. However, we have
  been consistently disappointed by the pralines served at restaurants.
  They are always either crystalline and crunchy, or sticky like
  undercooked taffy. Both are equally unacceptable.
  
  At the age of 10, I decided to try my hand at making pralines, and
  happened on a recipe in a current (1958) issue of _The Ladies Home
  Journal_, which I accidently adapted to make the perfect praline, not
  gooey, not crunchy, but of a solid consistency that becomes creamy in
  texture as it is eaten. The secret is to first screw up the recipe
  (at this point you are tempted to throw the whole thing out,
  including the pot) and then rectify the mistake into a wonderfully
  sinful sugary concoction. Now, no Mexican dinner or Christmas candy
  plate at our house is complete without them. Yield: Makes 16-24.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate to hard.
  : Time:  30 minutes cooking, 30 minutes cooling.
  : Precision:  Measure the ingredients and the temperatures.

  an opaque color and becomes creamy. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto a
  buttered cookie sheet and allow to harden. Makes two dozen. From
  Nathalie Dupree's New Southern Cooking Nathalie Dupree writes,
  "Pralines are traditionally given as Christmas gifts.  Their
  sweetness will linger in your mouth long after the candy is gone."

 Categories: Cajun, Candies

      2 c  Heavy cream
      4 c  Raw or brown sugar
      1 ts Vanilla
      2 c  Pecan halves
      2 tb Butter
 
  Alex Patout swears his recipe makes "The creamiest pralines anywhere"
  Butter a medium saucepan--this will make it easier to clean later.
  Pour in the cream and place over high heat. When it begins to boil,
  add the sugar and stir rapidly until it dissolves.  Then stir in the
  vanilla and pecans and continue to cook over medium heat, stirring
  frequently, until the mixture reaches the soft-ball stage (236F on
  the candy thermometer). Remove from heat and quickly beat in the
  butter--this helps arrest the cooking process.  The candy should lose
  its glossy color and become very cloudy. Lay out a long strip of
  waxed paper on a work surface. Moisten it with a damp towel.  Drop
  good-sized spoonfuls of the hot praline mixture onto the waxed paper,
  stirring the mixture occasionally as you go along to keep it well
  combined.  Remove the pralines from the paper before they have cooled
  completely--later on it will be hard to remove them without breaking
  them. Store in tightly sealed containers, with layers of waxed paper
  in between. Makes about 2 dozen From Alex Patout's Cajun home Cooking

      Title: PECAN PRALINES - PRUDHOMME
 Categories: Cajun, Candies
      Yield: 36 Servings
 
  1 1/2    Sticks unsalted butter
      1 c  Sugar
      1 c  Packed, light brown sugar
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
      1 c  Milk
      1 c  Chopped pecans
      2 c  Pecan halves
      2 tb Vanilla extract
 
  NOTE: To judge doneness, use one or more of the following guides; 1.
  Candy thermometer will read 240F 2. When done, the batter will begin
  forming distinct threads on the sides or bottom of the pan. 3. Near
  the end of the cooking time, make a test praline every few seconds.
  The early-test pralines will be somewhat runny, very shiny and
  somewhat translucent. The ideal praline will have progressed past
  that stage--it will not be runny and will be less shiny; when cooled
  it will be opaque, lusteriess and crumbly instead of chewy. 4.  Near
  the end of the cooking time, drizzle spoonfuls of the mixture across
  the surface of the mixture. When ready, the mixture will form a neat
  thread across the surface.
     Assemble all ingredients and utensils before starting to cook. You
  will need a large heavy bottomed aluminum pot or skillet with deep
  sides, a long handled metal whisk or spoon, 2 large spoons (or an ice
  cream scoop with a manual release) and a lightly buttered cookie
  sheet. Be careful not to get any of the mixture on you skin, as it
  sticks and can cause serious burns. Melt the butter in the pot over
  high heat. As soon as it's melted, add the sugars and cream.  Cook 1
  minute, whisking constantly.
   Add the milk and chopped pecans,  cook 4 minutes more, whisking
  constantly.  Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking and whisking 5
  minutes.  Add the pecan halves and vanilla and continue whisking and
  cooking until done, about 15 to 20 minutes longer (see NOTE above on
  tests for doneness).  If mixture starts to smoke toward end of
  cooking, lower the heat.
     Remove pan from heat.  Quickly and carefully drop the batter onto
  the cookie sheet by heaping spoonfuls, using the second spoon to
  scoop the batter off the first (or use ice cream scoop). Each praline
  should form a 2-inch patty about 1/2 inch thick.  Cool and store in
  an airtight container, or wrap each praline in plastic wrap or foil.
  LAGNIAPPE: To clean the pot and utensils, boil water in the pot with
  the utensils in it. This will melt the batter off. From Paul
  Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen

      Title: PECAN ROCCA
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Pecans, chopped (we use
           -chopped almonds on some
           -batches)
    3/4 c  Brown sugar (packed)
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine (butter
           -makes it richer)
    1/2 pk (6 oz size) semisweet
           -chocolate chips. (1/2 cup)
 
  Almond Rocca: This is not for Almond Roca, yet it is close enough and
  it is real easy. In fact my 14 year old daughter has been making it
  by herself at Christmas for the past 4 years. Hope this will meet
  your needs. It comes from the Betty Crocker cookbook, so you may have
  it on hand already.
  
  Toffee: Butter square pan, 9x9x2 inches. Spread chopped nuts in pan.
  Heat sugar and butter to boiling, stirring constantly. Boil over
  medium heat, stirring constantly, 7 minutes (watch it real close the
  last minute or two).  Immediately spread mixture evenly over nuts in
  pan. Sprinkle chocolate pieces over hot mixture; place a baking sheet
  over pan so contained heat will melt chocolate. Spread melted
  chocolate over canndy. While hot, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares. chill
  until firm.
  
  Now for the changes we use.
  
  When we are going to be giving this as a gift, we melt another 1/2
  cup of chocolate in the microwave.  Use an 7x7x2 pan (or smaller than
  the 9x9x2). Spread the melted chocolate on top of the buttered pan
  that is covered with the nuts.  After the chocolate is spread on top,
  sprinkle more nuts on top, while chocolate is still warm. Then cut
  into small sizes. After the candy is set, remove from the pan and
  wrap individually with desert foil. I get mine at the bakery supply,
  or a craft shop.

      Title: PECAN SMOKED TENDERLOINS
 Categories: Main
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Pork tenderloin
    1/2 c  Soy sauce
      2    Cloves garlic -- minced
      1 tb Grated fresh ginger
      1 tb Sesame oil
    1/4 c  Honey
      2 tb Brown sugar
 
  Combine all ingredients in a shaker and shake like the dickens. I
  like to use whole fresh ginger sliced into pieces 1/8-1/4 inch thick.
  That way I can remove them before grilling. I am not a big ginger
  fan, thus my slicing idea. I really think ginger can over power
  milder woods too. However, if you like ginger then go for the grated
  ginger.
  
  Marinate for at least 2hrs. or longer. I like overnight.
  
  Start your fire and put on your smokin' wood, I like pecan for this
  but use what you prefer. Any flavor should be fine.
  
  Sear over direct heat for about 5-8 min. On a gas grill reduce the
  heat to medium and move to *indirect* heat for about 35-40 min. (That
  simply means to leave one side's burner ON and put the meat on the
  other, OFF, side.)
  
  For charcoal grills, still do indirectly, but just go with the flow.
  If you're using a kettle type cooker and have the coals piled up
  high, watch your meat thermometer. Actually, watch your thermometer
  whatever you do.
  
  Exact times are not really needed if you use a thermometer. The
  digital probe thermometer is made for this kind of recipe. Set the
  temp watch for 155 temp. and go about your business.
  
  Tenderloins go from perfect to dry rather quickly. They are easy if
  you just watch the internal temperature closely. Cook them to an
  internal temperature of 155 deg. then transfer the loins to foil for
  10 min. The tenderloins will complete their cooking to 160deg. in the
  foil. The internal temp. of 160 is perfect to produce moist tender
  tenderloins. Great tasting. Be careful not to spill the juices that
  will pool in the foil. Pour this juice over the loins in your serving
  plate.

 Categories: Soups, Fruits/nuts, Low-cal
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      6 oz Pecans
      1 lg Garlic clove
      4 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
 
  This is a wonderful fall soup, and only 200 calories per serving.
  
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. ON a baking sheet, toast the pecans for 10-to-15
  minutes, checking from time to time to prevent burning. Toss
  occasionally. In a food processor, place the pecans, garlic and about
  1/2 cup of the stock. Turn the processor on and, with the motor
  running, add stock until you have a creamy consistency. (The mixture
  will absorb the stock.) Pass the pecan-stock mixture through a sieve
  into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the cream, season to taste
  with salt and pepper and serve.

  least 1 hour. Divide dough into 6 or 8 equal portions, depending on
  whether pan size is 3 or 4 inches. Roll each portion out onto lightly
  floured pastry cloth. Carefully transfer pastry to tart pans. Press
  against bottoms and sides of pans, then trim excess around rims. If
  pastry tears, patch with small bits of pastry trimmings. Reserve any
  remaining pastry, wrapped airtight, for another use. Refrigerate
  pastry-lined tart pans until ready to use.
  
  To make sauce, heat 1/2 cup sugar in small, heavy skillet or saucepan
  over medium heat until melted and medium amber in color. Carefully
  pour in 2/3 cup cream all at once, being careful to avoid splatters.
  Stir in 2 tablespoons butter. Cook, stirring constantly, over medium
  heat until caramel dissolves and sauce is smooth. Remove from heat.
  Store at room temperature if not using immediately, as sauce will
  harden if refrigerated.
  
  To make filling, combine corn syrup, 3/4 cup each sugar and brown
  sugar, 4 eggs and 2 egg yolks in medium bowl. Stir until blended.
  Heat 3 tablespoons butter in small skillet over medium heat until
  butter is foamy and light brown in color. Remove from heat and whisk
  into corn syrup mixture.
  
  To assemble tarts, set pastry-lined tart pans on large baking sheet.
  Divide pecans among tart pans and pour filling over them or pour in
  filling and arrange pecans on top in symmetrical pattern. Bake at
  375F 35 to 40 minutes. Remove to wire rack to cool. Serve tarts at
  room temperature topped with caramel sauce. Makes 6 to 8 tarts

  in mustard mixture the coat with ground pecans. Set aside. In frying
  pan heat oil and remaining butter over medium heat. When hot, add
  chicken breasts and cook 3 minutes per side until lightly browned (do
  this in batches, if necessary, to avoid crowding the pan). Remove
  breasts when they are browned; keep warm. Discard excess fat and any
  bits of pecans remaining in the pan. Return frying pan to medium heat
  and stir in sour cream, stirring up browned bits from the bottom of
  the pan. Whisk in remaining mustard; add salt and lemon pepper to

  centre of each heated dinner plate and place chicken breast on top.
  Serve with a steamed vegetable to contrast with the flavor and the
  texture of the chicken.

  half, it still comes out fine. I also serve this on top of rice, the
  sauce blends well with it. This recipe was the grand prize recipe in
  the Edmonton Journal Readers Favorite Recipes 1990-91 Cookbook.  It
  has become my personal favorite chicken recipe.

 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------EPICUREAN DELIGHT: BEARD-----------------------

MMMMM----------------------------SOUP---------------------------------
      1 lb Crab meat
    1/2 c  Milk
      2 tb Butter

MMMMM------------------------CREAM SAUCE-----------------------------
      3 tb Butter
      3 tb Flour
      2 c  Milk
  1 1/2 c  Cream, heavy
      4 tb Scotch whiskey
 
  Heat crabmeat in milk and butter.  Make cream sauce by cooking butter
  and flour together slowly for 2 minutes, then whisking in milk, and
  salt and pepper to taste. Bring to boil and whisk until smooth. Add
  cream; stir in crabmeat as soon as it simmers.  When it is just at
  boiling point, stir in whiskey.  Serve in heated cups with a
  sprinkling of parsley.
  
  No good cook is above profiting by another's mistakes. When his
  friend Mrs. Jennings added a splash of Scotch instead of using sherry
  in the crab soup she made for him, Beard didn't object to the flavor
  but did add her recipe to his lifetime collection.

      3    Grated carrots
      1 sm Bunch Celery, finely diced

      1 tb Ground sage
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Pepper
      1    Dash Red pepper
      1 qt Chicken Stock, thereabouts
 
  Presoak (8 hrs) or preboil (1 hr) beans, drain and rinse. Add chicken
  stock to soup pot and add beans. Turn heat on low. Add all
  ingredients just like that. Do not precook meat. The grated potato
  thickens the broth, another favorite thickener may be used, I prefer
  the potato. Simmer this soup for 2 hours before serving. I probably
  add more basil than listed, do that to taste.  Go easy on the sage
  but it is quite important. You may add a tablespoon of sugar to perk
  this soup up a bit, I do not recall off hand if I did or not. Another
  ingredient to perk it up is a tablespoon of vinegar--don't overdo.

           Beef roast
 
  Bring roast to room temp.  Preheat oven to 450.  Roast 1 hour, then
  turn off oven and leave it there without opening the oven for about 5
  hours.
  
  You can turn oven on about 30 mins before serving to warm it up a
  bit, but it turns out just as I prefer  - not over done and with some
  of the good ends for those who prefer well done!
  
  This is the way I cook almost any roast and it turns out delicious!!

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2    To 2-1/2 lbs. spare ribs
      1 tb Black beans
      2    Thin slices ginger root
      1    Scallion
      1 cl Garlic
      4 tb Soy sauce
      4 tb Honey
      3 tb Hoisin sauce
      1 tb Rice Wine
      1 c  Chicken broth
      2 tb Oil
 
  PREPARATION:
  
  Remove as much fat and gristle as you can from the meat and cut apart
  into individual ribs.  Wash black beans and mash. Mince ginger root
  and the scallion. Smash, peel, and mince garlic. Mix black beans,
  ginger root, garlic.  Mix soy sauce, honey, hoisin sauce, and rice
  wine.
  
  COOKING:
  
  Heat oil in a large deep skillet or wok, and add ginger root and the
  scallion.  Stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the ribs and stir-fry for 5
  minutes. Add soy sauce mixture; stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the
  chicken broth. Stir ribs to coat them with the sauce and bring to a
  boil. Reduce heat to low. Cover, and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring
  the ribs every 5 or 6 minutes to coat them with the sauce.  Remove
  the ribs from the skillet and spread in a large shallow roasting pan,
  in one layer if possible. Roast in a 350-degree oven for 10 minutes.
  If ribs are not dry in 10 minutes, roast a little longer.  They may
  also be barbecued on an outdoor grill instead of roasted in the oven.
  
  NOTE: This sauce is quite spicy.  If you prefer a milder dish, omit
  the hoisin sauce.

      Title: PEKING CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Low-cal
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      5    Cloves of garlic, minced
           (about 5 teaspoons)
      2 tb Minced fresh giner
      1 c  Hoisin sauce
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
    1/4 c  Rice wine vinegar
    1/4 c  Honey
      2 lb Skinless, boneless chicken
           Breasts, thinly sliced
           Across the grain
     12    Scallions
      1 tb Sesame oil
     12    Flour tortillas
 
  1.  Combine the garlic, ginger, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, and
      honey in a small bowl.  Whisk to mix.  Set aside half of this
  mixture
      to use as a sauce.  Marinate the chicken in the remaining mixture
  for
      one to two hours, stirring several times. 2. Meantime, make the
  scallion brushes.  Cut the roots and greens off
      the scallions.  There should be 3" pieces of scallion white
  remaining.
      Make a series of 1" lengthwise cuts in each end, gradually
  rotating
      the scallion, to form the individual "bristles" of the brush. Soak
      the scallions in a bowl of ice water for a couple of hours to
  swell
      the ends of the brushes. 3. Just before serving, heat the oil in a
  large non-stick frying pan.
      Cook the chicken over medium heat for 2 minutes, or until well
  done.
      Set aside and keep warm.  Lightly brush each tortilla with water
  and
      toast in a non-stick frying pan over high heat (or warm in a
  steamer).
      Divide the reserved marinade among 6 small ramekins or dishes. 4.
  Mount the chicken in the center of a platter. Arrange the tortillas
      (fold them in quarters or halves and scallion brushes around the
      chicken.  Invite guests to use a scallion to brush a tortilla with
      hoisin sauce.  Have them place a spoonful of chicken and the
  scallion
      brush in a tortilla and roll it into a cone. Nutritional

      Title: PEKING DUCK
 Categories: Chinese, Poultry, Loo
      Yield: 1 Duck
 
 
  Someone asked about Peking Duck. I've got two recipes in my
  collection - one is too simple, the other too long to post.
  
  So I'll just describe what to do, very briefly. If you want a good
  detailed recipe, check out Ken Hom's Chinese Technique (Simon &
  Schuster, 1981).
  
  1. Loosen the skin from the duck by massaging it, pulling the skin
  away where possible.
  
  2. Blanch the duck for a couple of minutes.
  
  3. Hang it up to dry for 4 hours, then baste it with sherry or with
  honey-water 1/2 and 1/2 mixture. Hang it up again to dry for 4 hours.
  
  4. Roast duck - one recipe says             the other says
                30 min. at 375               15 min at 450
                1 hour at 250                55 min at 350
                30 min at 400                20 min at 450
  
  The rationale for this I'm not sure of, but all recipes claim that
  changing the oven temperature makes a vast difference.
  
  5. To serve - slice off skin and cut it into 1"x2" pieces. Cut meat
  into similar-sized pieces. Provide 2" scallion lengths (green and
  white part), hoisin sauce (canned or bottled), pancakes (below). Each
  diner rolls a bit of meat, a bit of skin, and a scallion length into
  a pancake that has been spread with about a teaspoon of hoisin sauce
  and eats the mess with fingers.
  
  Pancakes (adapted from Grace Zia Chu, Pleasures of Chinese Cooking):
  
  2 c flour, 1 c boiling water, 2 T dark sesame oil
  
  Add water to flour in a bowl and work with a wooden spoon into a
  dough. Knead 10 min. and let rest for 10 min.
  
  Form into a long roll about 2" in diameter. Cut into 1/2" pieces and
  flatten to 1/4". Brush a little oil over a piece of dough and lay
  another piece over it. Roll out with rolling pin, slowly and from the
  center out, until the piece is 4" or more in diameter. Proceed until
  all dough is rolled out.
  
  Heat ungreased griddle over low flame and add dough circle. When it
  bubbles slightly, turn it over and heat the other side. While it is
  still warm, pull apart the two halves and fold at the center with the
  greased side inside. Repeat with remaining dough circles.
  
  Steam for 10 min. before using as above.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      7 lb LONG ISLAND DUCK
      5 c  HOT WATER
      3 tb MALTOSE
      1 tb VINEGAR
      1 tb SHERRY
      1 tb SESAME OIL
      1 tb SUGAR
      1 tb SOY SAUCE

     12 ea CHINESE PANCAKES, STEAMED
      1 x  JUST BEFORE SERVING
    1/4 lb SCALLIONS, CUT INTO 24 PIECE
      2 ea CUCUMBERS, PEELED, HALVED,
      1 x  AND JULIENNED
 
       1. Clean a fresh duck and pump it full of air through the neck to
       separate the skin from the meat. (At home, a bicycle pump may be
       used.) Pour boiling water over the duck three times. Carefully
       dry duck, slit stomach, and remove innards.
       2. Prepare marinade of hot water, maltose, and vinegar. Rub
       outside of duck all over with the mixture.
       3. Hang the duck by its neck at room tempera- ture, about 65
       degrees, for at least 12 hours.
       4. The next day, pre-heat oven to 400 degrees F. Place duck in
       pan and cook for 10 minutes. Turn heat to 450 degrees F and cook
       for additional 30 minutes or until the meat is tender and the
       skin is crispy.
       5. To carve the duck, place it breast side up and cut downwards
       towards the head. Slice thinly. Use only the outer slices-those
       which have skin. Slice both breasts. Slice the legs, cutting from
       the joint to the end of the leg. Discard remaining meat (without
       skin) or use for another dish. (See part 2 for more)

       6. Combine the sherry, sesame oil, sugar, soy sauce, and Hoisin
       Sauce.
       7. To assemble, place duck slices on pancakes. Add scallions,
       cucumbers, and Hoisin Sauce mixture to each. Serve. We insist on
       using Long Island ducks for this, our specialty. When we carve
       the duck in front of our guests, they may request skin only (the
       traditional way of eating Peking Duck), skin with meat, or meat
       from a certain part of the duck. The air separates the skin from
       the meat; the marinade and the hanging help to a create a
       deliciously rich, crisp skin.

      8    Green onions
      2    (1/4 in.) sliced gingeroot
      3 tb Honey
      2 tb Cornstarch
      1 cn Oven-ready biscuits
      1 sm Can plum sauce
 
  A day in advance, clean duck inside & out, dry thoroughly. Season
  inside with salt. Tie together stem ends of 2 green onions, place
  inside duck cavity with gingeroot. Bring edges of tail opening
  together, stitch with a length of fine wire. Attach another wire to

           For the broth:
           Bones from 1 Peking duck
           Carcass, neck, gizzard,
           Wings, leg & thigh bones
      1    Scallion
      1 sl Ginger
           Soup:
      1 lb Celery cabbage
           -(ch'ing tsai)
      2 oz Dried bean thread
           -(bean vermicelli)
           Water
      2 tb Oil
      2 sl Ginger
    1/2 tb Salt
    1/2 ts MSG
      6 c  Peking duck bone broth
           -from above (if there's
           -not enough, cut with
           -chicken broth or water)
      2 oz Chinese or Smithfield ham
           -slivered
      1    Duck gizzard, from the
           -broth pot, sliced thin
 
  Originally, Peking duck was served in three courses, to wit:
  
  1. the familiar pancake, scallion, and sauce bit (cucumber slivers
  also sometimes), with which the skin was served without the meat;
  
  2. the meat, combined with stir-fried vegetables in a soy-based sauce,
  served alone or with rice;
  
  3. a soup made with the bones of the duck just eaten.
  
  Now, in our streamlined 20th century, the courses are combined into
  one, the meat wrapped up with the skin and the scallion in the
  pancake, the vegetable course is omitted, and the soup is presumably
  drunk by the staff.
  
  Cut cabbage across into 1 - 1.5" chunks (these will separate on
  cooking). Soak bean thread in water until soft, then cut into 6"
  lengths (Warning - if you omit this cutting, you may find a guest
  choking on the stuff, which I did once).
  
  Simmer in water to cover for 45 min: bones from 1 Peking duck:
  carcass, neck, gizzard (which had been roasted with the duck), wings,
  leg and thigh bones. Season with 1 scallion and 1 slice ginger.
  
  Heat oil in a soup kettle. Add ginger, salt, and cabbage. Stir-fry 1
  min. Add all remaining ingredients except bean thread, gizzard, and
  MSG (if used). Cover and cook until cabbage is tender, 3 min or so.
  Bring soup to a boil, add bean thread, gizzard, and MSG. Turn heat
  off. Serve immediately.

      Title: PEKING RAVIOLIS WITH EGGPLANT
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 pk Eggroll wrappers or ravioli
           Wrappers
  1 1/2 lb Eggplant
      3    Cloves garlic
    1/4 c  Soy sauce or tamari sauce
    1/2 c  Scallions chopped coarsly
    1/2 ts Mustard
      1 ts Paprika (the hotter the
           Better)
      1 ts Ginger
 
  Slice eggplant in half lengthwise and cut off stems. Place face down
  on a cookie sheet. Use non-stick spray if the sheet is not already
  non stick.
  
  Bake for about 1 hour.  The eggplant should give to the touch. Take
  the eggplant out of the oven and allow to cool. While they are
  cooling mix the rest of the ingredients in a bowl to make a marinade.
  
  When the eggplant is cool, they should be a bit shriveled. With a
  spoon, scoop Out the insides into the marinade. Let sit for at least
  15 minutes.
  
  Pour the eggplant and marinade into a food processor to puree for
  about 30 seconds. The result should look totally inedible.
  :-)
  
  Fill a large stock pan with about 1.5 inches of water and set on the
  stove to boil.
  
  If you are using wonton wrappers or ravioli wrappers you can skip this
  step. Take out two eggroll wrappers and cut in even quarters.
  
  Place out about 8 wrapper pieces on a flat clean surface like a
  cutting board. Spoon about 1/2 teaspoon of the eggplant puree into
  the middle of each wrapper. Dip your fingers into a bowl of water and
  run along two opposite edges of a wrapper or along all four edges.
  Take one corner and fold it over to the opposite corner forming a
  triangle. Carefully press the wet edges together to form a seal.
  Place the triangular ravioli onto a rack to dry a bit and repeat the
  process with the other seven wrappers.
  
  If you put too much filling in a wrapper, it will ooze out the edge.
  Just make sure you press firmly on that edge to force the filling out
  all the way. You want the wrapper edges touching each other so they
  will form a seal.
  
  If you have a ravioli press, as sold at Chinese supply stores, follow
  the
  
  directions given with the press.
  
  After filling eight raviolis, turn them over on the drying rack and
  repeat the process with eight more.
  
  At this point, your water should be at a rolling boil and you can
  carefully add the raviolis.  First stir the water in a circular
  motion with a slotted spoon. Place one ravioli on the spoon and
  carefully lower it into the water. Continue stirring until the
  ravioli starts to float. Add another ravioli. Don't add so many
  raviolis that they crowd each other in the pan. They should not touch
  each other while cooking or they might cook together.
  
  The raviolis are cooked when they float easily and are somewhat
  transparent. The eggplant mixture will spread in the wrapper a bit but
  should not seep out if they were sealed well.
  
  As they reach the floating stage, carefully lift the raviolis out of
  the water with the slotted spoon and move them back to the drying
  rack.
  
  When the raviolis are dry again use a toothpick to connect the two
  opposite corners and place on a tray of lettuce or ornamental cabbage
  to serve. If you are not concerned with fat, you can lightly coat a
  plate with sesame or hot pepper oil and place the raviolis directly
  on the oil. They can be kept on a hot pad this way. Otherwise eat
  them immediately.

      Title: PEKING STYLE NOODLES WITH BEAN SAUCE & MIXE
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian, Chinese
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      8 oz Noodles
           -- (3-4 cups after cooking)
      6 oz Plain pressed tofu
    1/2 c  Green soybeans
           -- (frozen or fresh)  -OR-
      2 oz -Baby corn spears
    1/2 c  Bamboo shoot, diced finely
      2 oz Cucumber
      1 ts Garlic, minced
      3 tb Chinese bean sauce; -OR-
      4 tb -Dark miso
      3 tb Vegetable oil
  1 1/2 c  Water
  1 1/2 tb Soy sauce
    1/2 ts Sugar
  2 1/2 tb Cornstarch; dissolved in...
      3 tb Water
    1/2 ts Sesame oil
 
  If you are cooking the noodles first, drain them, remove to a bowl or
  serving platter, and toss with 1/2 tablespoon sesame oil to prevent
  sticking (do not rinse in cold water as this reduces flavor). Crumble
  the pressed tofu coarsely to yield 1-1/2 cups. Parboil green soybeans
  till almost tender yet still firm (10 minutes for frozen). If using
  fresh baby corn spears, steam or parboil till tender; if canned,
  rinse with boiling water.  Rinse green soybeans or corn in cold water
  and chop finely. You should have about 1/2 cup baby corn. It is not
  necessary to peel or seed the hothouse (English) or Oriental
  cucumber. Regular cucumber should be pared and seeded, but leave a
  few narrow strips of skin for color and texture.  Julienne finely to
  yield 1/2 cup. If you are using miso, dissolve it in 1/4 cup warm
  water. Put 3 tablespoons oil into a preheated pan over high.  When
  the oil is hot, reduce heat to medium-high. Add garlic and stir-fry a
  few seconds to release aroma. Add pressed tofu and bean sauce or
  miso. Stir-fry briefly to mix.  Add 1-1/2 cups water, 1 tablepsoon
  soy sauce, and 1/2 teaspoon sugar.  Cook, stirring occasionally,
  until the boil is reached. Gradually stir in cornstarch mixture and
  cook, stirring, another minute or so until the consistency is like a
  light gravy, not too thick.  Test for salt, and add an extra
  tablespoon soy sauce if needed. (at this point, if you like, you can
  heat noodles and/or green soybeans, baby corn, and bamboo shoot by
  combining with the sauce until just mixed.) Add 1/2 teaspoon sesame
  oil. Remove from the stove. Pour sauce over noodles, and top with
  garnish in separate arrangement (garnish with just the cucumber if
  you have added soybeans or baby corn and bamboo shoot to the sauce).
  Toss before serving.

      Title: PENN & TELLER DESSERT
 Categories: Desserts, Halloween
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Red jello mix
           Cool whip
           Karo syrup
           Dk red wine or grape juice
 
  Here is the outline for something I saw this morning on Geraldo (by
  accident) that was done by Penn & Teller. It's more of a macabre
  show-off desert, but I laughed my ass off when I saw it.
  
  Okay, start off by making some Jell-O, preferably strawberry or
  cherry or some other flavor that's naturally red. But, use two to
  three times as much Jell-O mix as you normally would, to thicken up
  the consistency. After this is mixed, stir in some cool whip, and
  pour it into your favorite standard party mold (the dome kind would
  be good).
  
  Get a CLEAN plastic bag (inside and out) and place in it some Karo
  syrup. Now add something like a very dark red wine, or grape juice.
  What you want is a semi-thick VERY dark red (opaque) liquid which
  looks not unlike blood. Starting to get the picture yet?
  
  Okay, now place this bag in the mold, so that the bag is still
  floating on top.  Keep in mind that you want the Jell-O plus the bag
  to completely fill the mold, but have a level surface, as this thing
  is going to flip over later on.  Put it in the fridge, and allow it
  to chill and set.
  
  When you take it out of the refrigerator, you should decorate it a
  little. Try drizeling some chocolate glaze on top and poping a couple
  of strawberries or cherries on top of this. Allow to set if
  necessary, and then bring it out to your dinner guests.
  
  At this point, your dinner guests will probably be oo'ing and ah'ing
  over this rather nice dessert you've brought out to them. Make sure
  you've got that big pointy butcher knife in one hand as you set this
  beauty down on the table.
  
  Now you get to play Norman Bates:  cut into the side of this, making
  sure you go deep enough to cut into the bag real wide. As you
  continue to cut out a piece of the geltin mold, the bag will leak
  into this, and your bewildered guests will think your dessert is
  _BLEEDING_. Not to disappoint them, cut out one of these bloody
  pieces of geletin and plop it down on a plate.  If you're lucky, it
  will look like a recently-extracted body organ.
  
  Yes, this is gross.  Yes, I wouldn't bring this to the typical dinner
  party.  Yes, I probably have a *very* warped sense of humor. But, I
  laughed quite loudly when I saw this being done by Penn & Teller. At
  the very least, it might be fun for a Halloween party...

    3/4 lb Macaroni pasta like penne
 
  *Pasta with Marinated Tomatoes, Capers, Olives, Garlic, Chilies, and
  Herbs. Author's note:  "This pasta dish would not be the same without
  the piquancy it picks up from the capers, and from its Italian name.
  The dish loosely translates as 'bad woman pasta,' as several other
  lusty tomato and garlic and herb pasta dishes do.  Legend has it that
  these dishes are so named because they are very aromatic and lure
  customers in when other charms fail. Another explanation is that the
  dishes are so quick they can be prepared between customers."
  
  Combine olive oil with olives, capers, garlic, tomatoes, basil, salt,
  and pepper flakes.  Let sit and marinate for half hour if possible.
  Cook penne in rapidly boiling salted water until al dente. Drain and
  toss with sauce. Serve immediately, or let cool and enjoy as a salad.

      2 tb Parsley; finely chopped
      1 tb Red pepper; crushed
    1/4 c  Capers; rinsed, drained
     24    Kalamata olive, pitted
 
  To prepare the marinara base:  Combine the garlic and basil in a food
  processor or blender and chop finely. Add the salt, black pepper and
  water; process 30 seconds. Stir into the tomatoes and set aside.
  
  To prepare the puttanesca sauce:  Heat the olive oil in a large saute
  pan. Add the anchovies and cook, mashing with the back of a spoon,
  until disintegrated. Add the garlic, parsley and crushed red pepper
  flakes. Cook 1 minute.  Add the capers and olives; cook seconds.
  
  Stir in the marinara base and simmer 5 minutes.  Keep warm.
  
  Cook the pasta in lots of boiling water according to package
  directions. Drain and put back into the hot pan.
  
  Add the sauce and Parmesan.  Stir well and transfer to a heated bowl
  for serving.
  
  Note:  The original recipe called for 2 Tbsp salt and 3 Tbsp crushed
  red pepper flakes.  Times testers felt that the reduced amounts were
  adequate. [Moderator's Note: Maybe for the salt....]
  
  Obmodification:  I plan to reduce the olive oil to 1/4 cup next time,
  which is probably more than adequate and cuts down a bit on the fat.
  
  This is from the new Seattle Times column, By Request, which helps
  readers get recipes for favorite dishes they have enjoyed at restau-
  rants, and to locate recipes they have heard about or lost. As a
  puttanesca connoisseur, I've found that Salvatore Ristorante Italiano
  in Seattle makes the *best* puttanesca I've had at any restaurant in
  the area. The following has been shared by the owner, Salvatore
  Anania. Hope you enjoy it as much as I.

      Title: PENNE SAUCED WITH LEEKS & LEMON
 Categories: Entree
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
        5    trimmed medium leeks -- (4
  :          to 6)
        1 TB lemon juice
        6 qt water -- (5 to 6)
        2 c  water -- (1 to 2)
        2 TB salt
        1 ts lemon zest -- minced
        1 TB chopped flat-leaf parsley
      1/4 c  extra-virgin olive oil
  :          Sea salt
  :          Freshly ground black pepper
       16 oz penne or other short pasta
      1/2 c  grated Parmesan cheese
  
  This is a basic recipe that demonstrate the cook's desire to use as
  much of the nutritients and flavors that leech to the water when
  cooking vegetables and pasta.
  
  Clean the leeks: Remove roots and any tough, bruised outer leek
  leaves. Split each leek in half lengthwise and rinse carefully to
  eliminate all dirt between leaves.
  
  Relish: Slice some leek, a small section of the white part, into the
  thinnest possible half-rings, stop when you make 1/4 cup. Toss this
  measure with the lemon juice and set aside. Cook to puree: Bring the
  5 to 6 quarts water to a rolling boil; add salt and cook remaining
  leeks (cut into chunks that fit in the pot) for 6 to 8 minutes until
  soft, and totally tender. Remove leeks from pot with slotted spoon,
  refresh in cold water; drain and squeeze lightly to remove excess
  water. Reserve leek cooking water.
  
  Puree leeks in food processor with lemon zest, parsley, extra virgin
  olive oil, 1/2 cup leek cooking water, salt and pepper. Transfer
  sauce to 3-quart pot.
  
  Cook pasta: Add 1 to 2 cups fresh water to leek cooking water and
  return to rolling boil. Add pasta and cook until it al dente (about
  three-quarters of the recommended cooking time).
  
  Drain, *reserving 2 cups cooking water.*
  
  Add pasta, 1/2 cup pasta water and (lemon) marinated leek rings,
  drained, to leek puree in pot and cook over highest heat for 3 to 5
  minutes until pasta is almost cooked and saucecoats pasta. Add more
  pasta water, 1/4 cup at a time if sauce gets too dry. Sauce should
  surround pasta but be slightly liquid.  We still have cheese to add
  and the cheese will thicken the sauce.
  
  Add grated Parrnesan cheese, heat for an additional minute to melt
  cheese, and serve immediately.

  An unusual combination of tastes makes this a pasta dish with a
  difference - raisins and pine nuts give it a quite distinctive
  quality. Serve it with a tossed green salad.
  
  Steam the cauliflower florets 'al dente'. Cut them into thin slices.
  Saute the onion in the oil over a moderate heat until it begins to
  brown. Simmer, partially covered, for 5 minutes. Stir in the raisins,
  pine nuts and cauliflower and season to taste with salt and pepper.
  
  Toss the cooked penne with half of the sauce and spoon the rest over
  the top. Sprinkle the dish with the grated cheese and garnish with

      Title: PENNE WITH CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    3/4 lb Boneless chicken breasts
  1 1/2 ts Olive oil
    1/2 c  Green onion; chopped
      3    Garlic cloves; crushed
     28 oz Ital. tomatoes; with juice
     12    Fresh basil leaves; chopped
      1    Can Pitted ripe olives;drain
    1/2 ts Hot pepper flakes; crushed
     10 oz Penne; or other tube pasta
      3 oz Part-skim mozzarella; diced
      1 tb Fresh parsley; chopped
    1/2 c  Fresh Parmesan; grated
 
  Earlier in the day, add enough water to the skinned chicken to cover
  it. Poach chicken in simmering water (uncovered) until chicken is no
  longer pink. This will take about 8 minutes. Allow chicken to cool in
  poaching liquid. (I put it in the refrig. rather than leave it at
  room temp. Cooling it in the liquid makes it more tender) Later,
  remove chicken from poaching liquid and chop it into small or
  bite-size pieces. Save the poaching liquid to add to the water you're
  going to cook the pasta in. In large non-stick pan, cook the onion
  and garlic in heated olive oil until softened. Add hot pepper flakes
  and tomatoes and juice. Cook about 30 minutes over med. heat until
  sauce thickens. Cook penne in poaching liquid with additional water
  as needed. Combine chicken with the sauce mixture in serving bowl.
  Add parsley and cheese. Sprinkle with parmesan and serve immediately.

    1/4 c  Fresh flat-leaf parsley

           -scissors
 
    In an unheated skillet large enough to hold the pasta later on,
  combine oil, garlic, crushed red peppers and a pinch of salt,
  stirring to coat with oil. Cook  over moderate heat just until the
  garlic turns golden but not brown, 2 to 3 minutes. If using whole
  canned tomatoes, place a food mill over the skillet and pure'e
  tomatoes directly into it. Crushed tomatoes can be added directly.
  Stir to blend, and simmer, uncovered, until sauce begins to thicken,
  about 15 minutes. Taste for seasoning.
  
    Meanwhile, in a large pot, bring 6 quarts of water to a rolling
  boil. Add 3 tablespoons salt and the penne, stirring to prevent
  sticking. Cook until tender but firm to the bite. Drain thoroughly.
  
   Add the drained pasta to the skillet with the tomato sauce. Toss.
  Add the vodka, toss again, then add the cream and toss. Cover, reduce
  the heat to low for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the pasta to absorb the
  sauce. Add the parsley and toss again. Transfer to warmed shallow
  soup bowls and serve immediately. (Traditionally, cheese is not
  served with this dish.)

      Title: PENNSYLVANIA ALTAR BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    7/8 c  Water, lukewarm
           -(about 110 degrees F.)
      3 tb Honey
  1 1/2 ts Olive oil
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 pk Yeast (dry),
           -active
  2 2/3 c  Flour, whole wheat
           -(unsifted)
 
  Combine water and yeast in mixing bowl.  Add honey, olive oil and
  salt. Add flour.  If flour does not completely dampen, add small
  amounts of water until all of the flour is damp. Be sparing with the
  water.
  
  Turn out onto a very lightly floured board and knead thoroughly for 5
  minutes until dough is extremely elastic.
  
  Sprinkle a tiny amount of olive oil in a big bowl, then roll the
  dough in it until the dough is covered with olive oil. Leave the
  dough in the bowl, cover with a cloth, and let rise for 1 1/2 hours,
  or until doubled in size.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Punch the dough down, knead again for
  a few seconds.  Roll the dough out with a rolling pin, as if you were
  making a pizza crust, to a thickness of about 1/4 inch.
  
  Using something like a large peanut butter jar or a giant cookie
  cutter, cut out about 4-inch circles of the dough and lift them onto a
  slightly-oiled baking sheet. Press a cross into the top surface of
  each, so that it can be easily broken apart.
  
  Bake the loaves, on their baking sheet, in a preheated 350 degree F.
  oven for 10 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An earthy, whole-wheat bread used for communion -- In Pittsburgh
  and other Western Pennsylvania parishes of the Episcopal church, it
  is common to use small, thin loaves of real, fresh, home-made bread
  at communion instead of the pressed wafers popular in most other
  places. The bread has a chewy texture to it, keeps tremendously well,
  and makes a great lunchbox food (each "loaf" is about the size a
  large cookie). This recipe comes from Father Bill Coats of the Church
  of the Redeemer in Pittsburgh. Yield: 8-10 single-serving loaves.
  
  *  You can freeze these loaves easily; either put them in
  single-serving ziploc bags and use them for school lunches, or freeze
  a bunch in a large food-storage bag.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 2 hours rising, 10 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 pk Chicken breasts or thighs,
           - boneless (approx 1lb.)
      1 tb Butter or margarine
      1 cn Cream of mushroom soup
    1/4 c  Milk
      1 c  Sliced mushrooms (opt.)
      1 tb Teryaki sauce
      1    Salt, pepper & chili
           - powder
 
  Melt the butter in an 8" skillet or fry pan, add chicken, salt,
  pepper and some chili powder. When chicken is browned on both sides
  remove it to a plate. Put the cream of mushroom soup in the skillet,
  add teriyaki sauce and milk mixing until soup is smooth. Add more
  salt, pepper and chili powder to taste. Add mushrooms if desired,
  fresh or canned. Put cooked chicken pieces back into skillet until
  thoroughly warmed and covered in sauce. You may need little more milk
  if you have a lot of chicken. There is normally enough sauce to cover
  the chicken and some for the rice, noodles or mashed potatoes served
  with it. The sauce should have a mellow taste not to cover up the
  chicken but normally has a spicy, warm aftershock. Preparation Time:
  Less than 25 minutes. ~--

           Freshly ground BLACK PEPPER
           *coarsley grd. not too fine
      2 tb Vegetable oil

  Source: "What to Cook:When you think there is nothing in the house to
  eat" Author: Arthur Schwartz
  
  "This is an unbelievably quick fix for a cocktail or soup
  accompaniment."
  
  Makes 2 approximately 12x8-inch sheets
  =======================================================
  ================== 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  
  2. In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the flour, salt and pepper.
  
  3. Add the oil and stir until mixture resembles fine meal.
  
  4. With a fork, stir in the cold water, using just enough to make
     the dough gather into a ball.
  
  5. Divide the dough in half and, on a well-floured board, roll out
  each
     half as thinly as possible into a rough rectangle that fits on a
     baking sheet.
  
  6. Place dough on baking sheet and if you want neat-looking crackers,
     score it into squares or diamonds.
  
  7. Bake for 25-30 minutes, turning after 15 minutes. Dough should be a
     pale brown and snap, not bend.
  
  8. Break into crackers or irregular pieces. Can be stored in a tin.
  
  Variations: Instead of black pepper, season with hot red pepper
  flakes or any other spice that seems appropriate to the crackers'
  eventual use. Or, after the dough has been transferred to a baking
  sheet, sprinkle with coarse salt and press lightly into the top.

      Title: PEPPER JELLY
 Categories: Desserts, Spices, Jams
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  3 1/2 c  Sugar
      1 c  Cider vinegar
    3/4 c  Sweet pepper slices
    1/2 c  Hot pepper slices
      1    Packet (1/2 bottle) Certo
           -liquid pectin
 
  Simmer sugar, vinegar and peppers very slowly for 10 minutes stirring
  to be sure all sugar is well dissolved. Turn off heat and let stand
  for 30 minutes. Bring to a boil and add Certo. Boil 1 minute. Cool
  and stir with non-metal spoon 5 minutes. Check that it comes of the
  spoon in a ribbon or sheet. If not, cook it a bit more. Pour into
  jars and seal, or pour into freezer containers and freeze (that's
  what I do).
  
  Note: the peppers are seeded and sliced 1/4 inch thick with a knife
  or on a mandoline, for a marmalade effect. I like to use red and
  yellow peppers for color, or all green. Mixing red and green isn't as
  pretty as you might think it would be, as it makes the jelly browner.
  I have substituted home made pectin, which seems to work fine, if it
  is the same consistency as the Certo. It just tends to be pinker. I
  make that by boiling apple skins and cores in as little water as
  possible, with a lid on, and then cooling it and pressing the juice
  out through a sieve and saving it in a bottle in the fridge till I
  have enough. How much is enough? About a cup of the home made pectin,
  as I recall. If the stuff doesn't jell right I save it in the fridge,
  then later add more pectin and more sugar and cook it until it sheets

      Title: PEPPER POACHED PEARS
 Categories: Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Water
  1 1/2 c  White wine
      1 c  Sugar
      1 tb Black peppercorns
    3/4    Inch piece fresh ginger,
           -sliced
      1    Cinnamon stick
      2    Cloves
    1/8 ts Salt
        pn Crushed red pepper
      1 ts Wine vinegar
      4    Firm pears, peeled, halved
           -and cored
    1/2 ts Vanilla
 
  Ran across this recipe in an article in the Chron about weird taste
  combinations and thought it worth passing on. (Never mind the
  comments.) BTW, this is one of the first recipes I entered using
  WordStar 7.0. When I ran the spell checker on it WS didn't recognize
  "quart" or "vinegar" as words!!!!  Amazing.  "Nam Yuey" I can
  understand, but "VINEGAR"?
  
  These are wonderful served over ice cream or with pound cake. Combine
  the water, wine, sugar, peppercorns, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, salt,
  red pepper and vinegar in a small saucepan.  Bring to a boil.
  
  Add the pears and reduce heat to a simmer.  Cook for 10 minutes,
  until the pears are tender, turning every few minutes so they cook
  evenly.
  
  When the pears are uniformly tender, remove to a plate. Reduce the
  liquid in the pan by half.  Strain into a bowl. Add the vanilla and
  return the pears to the liquid to cool.
  
  Serve at room temperature.
  
  Serves 4.

      Title: PEPPER RAINBOW SOUP
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 c  Chicken broth
      1 md Onion, chopped
      2 c  Rice, cooked
      4    Bell peppers, in
           -assorted colors
    1/2 ts Savory
      2 ts Chives
      2    Egg yolks
      2 tb Lemon juice
           Salt and pepper,
           -to taste
 
  Bring the broth to a boil.  Cook the rice.
  
  Chop the onion and saute the pieces until they are golden brown. Add
  to the broth. Add the savory and chives to the broth.
  
  Clean the seeds and cores from the peppers and chop the cleaned
  peppers into pieces. Set chopped peppers aside.
  
  Add the rice to the broth and cook for 5 minutes.  Add the chopped
  peppers to the boiling broth and simmer for 1 minute. Meanwhile, beat
  the egg yolks in a 2-cup bowl.
  
  Thicken the soup with the egg yolks by adding the hot soup to the
  beaten yolks a little bit at a time, stirring constantly, until a cup
  or two of soup has been added to the yolks. Dump this mixture back
  into the simmering broth. Add the lemon juice. Season to taste with
  salt and pepper. Serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A light summer soup with multicolored peppers -- Every year in late
  summer, produce counters fill with multicolored bell (capsicum)
  peppers. Green bell peppers, red bell peppers, yellow bell peppers.
  Even purple bell peppers. Creative chefs try hard to take advantage
  of the splash of colors, and make rainbow salads or rainbow
  appetizers. Here is a different way to rejoice in multicolored
  peppers: pepper soup. The peppers float to the top of a light broth
  and artfully dodge your spoon as you try to eat them. Yield: Serves
  6-8.
  
  *  The thickening technique is identical to that used in avgolemono
  recipes, which you can consult for more details.
  
  *  The flavor and texture balance of the soup depends on the amount
  that the peppers are cooked. The more you cook them, the more their
  flavor exudes into the broth but the more they lose their texture. I
  find that about 2 minutes in simmering broth is the right amount.
  
  *  You can have fun with colored geometric patterns as you cut the
  peppers. They don't have to be chunks. You can cut the yellow peppers
  into circles and the green peppers into long strips and the red
  peppers into cross sections and the purple peppers into stocky
  triangles. Be creative. The colored shapes will float to the top of
  the broth and play hide-and-seek with each other.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (egg yolk thickening and pepper cooking
  require some practice).
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

  This easy version of the classic pepper sauce clearly illustrates why
  some old-time combinations just cannot be improved upon. Serve this
  with beef or game, especially pheasant. This sauce will also keep for
  two days in the refrigerator.  Rewarm over low heat before serving.
  
  Saute the bacon in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat for 2
  minutes. Add the onions, carrots, shallots, and leek and cook until
  well browned, about 12 to 15 minutes.Stir in the vinegar and simmer
  over low heat until the liquid has evaporated, about 10 to 15
  minutes. Whisk in the flour and cook one minute more. Then add the
  garlic, wine, bouquet garni and stock. Simmer over low heat for one
  hour. Stir in the cracked peppercorns and salt then simmer for 10
  minutes more. strain through a sieve lined with a layer of
  cheesecloth. Return to the saucepan and add the brandy. Simmer 3
  minutes over low heat and serve hot.
  
  Yield:  About 2 1/2 Cups of sauce.

  Place the lamb skin side down on a cutting board or other surface and
  pat it dry.  Sprinkle the meat with salt and pepper. Arrange the
  tomatoes and roasted peppers down the center of the lamb, then roll
  up the lamb, secure it with twine, and set it in a roasting pan. In a
  bowl, whisk the oil, herbs, garlic, and Tabasco sauce. Pour the
  mixture over the lamb, turning once to coat.  Cover and refrigerate
  for 24 hours, turning once or twice.
  
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Place the uncovered roast in the oven
  and immediately reduce the heat to 325 degrees F. Cook the lamb for
  20 minutes per pound, about 2 hours, or until a meat thermometer
  registers 125 degrees F. for rare or 140 degrees F. for medium. Let
  the lamb stand for 15 minutes before slicing. Meanwhile, in a small
  saucepan over low heat, whisk together the chevre, garlic, cream, and
  Tabasco sauce until the mixture is well blended and heated
  thoroughly. Garnish with rosemary and serve with the lamb.

      Yield: 1 Info below
 
      1    Info below
 
                     - Basic and Historical Information -
  
  "Pepper is arguably the most popular seasoning in the world. It has
  been an important and precious commodity throughout history, not only
  flavoring food, but also serving as currency - or being demanded as
  ransom - in both the East and the West.  The ancient Greeks and
  Romans cooked with it; peppercorns were so esteemed in
  twelfth-century England that a Guild of Pepperers was founded among
  London merchants; and Marco Polo was impressed by the large quantity
  of pepper used in thirteenth-century China.
  
  "Peppercorns are the fruits of a perennial vine, Piper nigrum, which
  is native to India and is now grown commercially in eastern Asia,
  Borneo, Brazil, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the West
  Indies. In the wild, vines may reach 20 feet long, but in commercial
  cultivation they are trained on posts 5 or 6 feet tall to simplify
  harvesting. The plants are grown for three or four years before they
  are harvested; once they are established, the vines continue to bear
  fruits for 15 to 20 years. The berries, which are borne in spikes,
  turn from green to orange and then red as they mature.  To keep them
  from dropping, they are harvested before they ripen fully.
  
  "Black, green, and white peppercorns come from the same plant; the
  differences are in the maturity of the berries at the time of harvest
  as well as the technique of processing. All contain various oils and
  resins and the alkaloid piperine, which gives them their pungency."
  
  "BLACK PEPPERCORNS are harvested in the unripe, green state and left
  to dry for seven to ten days.  As they dry, they shrivel and turn
  dark brown or black.  Black peppercorns are quite hard and have the
  strongest flavor of the three types of P. nigrum berries. Freshly
  ground black pepper is highly pungent and aromatic, and can be
  bitingly hot.
  
  "GREEN PEPPERCORNS, as their name suggests, are also picked when
  green, but they are preserved immediately; if they are not, they
  begin to darken toward the black pepper stage. For years, green
  peppercorns were commonly preserved in brine; today, they are usually
  freeze-dried. Although they have a certain tanginess, green
  peppercorns are less pungent than black or white ones, and they are
  usually not as hard and are therefore easier to crack or grind.
  
  "WHITE PEPPERCORNS are prepared from berries that have been allowed to
  ripen almost completely on the vines. The harvested berries are
  soaked in water for a day, after which the outer shell is easily
  removed, leaving a small gray seed which dries to tannish white.
  White pepper has a hint of mustiness and is milder in flavor than
  black pepper, although still quite pungent."

      1    Info below
 
                         - Peppercorn Substitutes -
  
  "Peppercorns are used throughout the world, in every kind of cuisine.
  Where berries of P. nigrum aren't available, the following peppers or
  pepperlike fruits are sometimes substituted.
  
  "Cubeb pepper (P. cubeba), also known as the tailed pepper, is grown
  in Indonesia, Java, Malaysia, and the West Indies. It has a burning,
  bitter taste and was the first variety of pepper to travel from Asia
  to the Mediterranean.  It is an ingredient of the Moroccan spice
  blend called ras el hanout.
  
  "Long pepper (P. longum) is related to black pepper both botanically
  and in taste.  The fruit, which grows on a vine similar to that of P.
  nigrum, is harvested when green and about an inch long. The flavor is
  very much like that of black pepper, though less pungent and slightly
  sweet. In the Far East, it is always used whole to flavor stews,
  preserves, and pickles."
  
  "Pink or red peppercorns are from shrubs or small trees (Schinus
  spp.), mostly native to South America, which are not related to P.
  nigrum. Some species of these trees are grown in warmer parts of the
  United States. The fruits have bright red-pink, paper-thin casings
  enclosing dark brown berries.  The flavor of the berries is mild,
  though slightly pungent, with a hint of sweetness. The Food and Drug
  Administration, concerned about the allergic reactions of some people
  to Schinus berries, removed them from the market for a time in the
  early 1980's. Now 'pink peppercorns' from Reunion, an island in the
  Indian Ocean belonging to France, are available without any warnings.
  We have heard of reactions ranging from rashes to nausea but have not
  been able to find information on quantities consumed or profiles of
  the victims. Both of us have eaten pink peppercorns occasionally and
  in moderate amounts for years without adverse reactions. Those
  concerned about possible allergies should consume pink peppercorns
  with care (you might try eating _one_ as a test) or avoid them
  entirely.
  
  "Sichuan pepper (Zanthoxylum piperitum) is also known as Szechuan,
  Japanese, or anise pepper, or fagara. This deciduous tree or shrub,
  unrelated to P. nigrum, is native to Japan, Korea, and northern
  China. Each reddish-brown dried fruit contains a bitter black seed
  which is discarded before use.  The dried fruits are a peppery,
  pungent spice, an essential ingredient of the Chinese five-spice
  mixture (which also includes star anise, cassia or cinnamon, fennel
  seeds, and cloves.)"

      1    Info below
 
                          - Peppercorns in Food -
  
  "Peppercorns are graded by size and provenance.  Large berries are
  considered premium, and those from the Tellicherry and Malabar
  districts in India, which are considered the most pungent and
  complex, command high prices.
  
  "Whole peppercorns keep almost indefinitely, but ground or cracked
  pepper (peppercorns that have been cracked, not ground) begins to
  lose aroma and pungency almost immediately after processing. The
  difference is quite noticeable, too, between freshly ground and
  commercially ground or cracked pepper.
  
  "...good pepper flavor merits the investment in a quality pepper
  mill... we keep a light-colored wooden mill for white pepper and a
  dark one for black pepper. Mills with high-quality, adjustable
  grinding mechanisms can last a lifetime.  With a mill, pepper can be
  ground into dishes at the stove or onto salads at the table. A heavy
  ceramic mortar and pestle is also useful for grinding pepper as well
  as other spices. Ceramic is far better than wood, which retains
  flavors and aromas, or metal, which can produce off-flavors and
  discoloration. Quantities of spices too large for the mortar can be
  ground in an electric spice grinder."
  
  "Besides stimulating the appetite and aiding digestion, pepper is a
  good flavor addition to most dishes. Black pepper is used with meat,
  fish, or poultry, in stocks, marinades, pickling, poaching, soups,
  sauces, stews, even in spice cakes and cookies. It is essential to
  the popular spice blend used for blackening meat and fish, and
  neither pepperpot soup nor steak au poivre could exist without it. We
  use whole peppercorns in our pickling spice mixture, in making stocks
  and marinades, and for poaching.
  
  "White pepper is often used in place of black where dark specks are
  undesirable or for a little less pungency. It is used in sauces,
  soups, mashed potatoes, omelets and other egg dishes, vichyssoise,
  and with fish and cauliflower.  Green pepper is used most often in
  sauces, dressings, and soups; it seems to go well in vinaigrettes for
  green and potato salads. Pink peppercorns are used in sauces and
  dressings and for garnish.
  
  "Remarkably, the flavor of fruit is heightened by a little pepper. The
  French and Italians grind pepper over fresh strawberries or
  raspberries, sometimes adding a splash of vinegar. When we want to
  gild the deliciousness of fresh pears, we mix a little blue cheese
  with cream, spread it on pear slices and garnish with a generous

  Other Cooking Methods
  
  Freshly made paneer is delicious and may be eaten immediately, without
  further preparation or adornment. However, in most recipes, paneer
  must be cooked before it is added to the other ingredients. Broiling,
  which is discussed in the story, is the method I prefer because very
  little oil is used. If you don't wish to broil the cheese, here are a
  few alternatives:
  
  Toaster Oven: Grease a small baking tray with vegetable oil. Place
  paneer cubes on the tray and brush with oil. Bake at 400 degrees F.
  until golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove and use in any
  cooked paneer recipe.
  
  For a quick paneer curry, place cooked cheese cubes on a heated
  serving platter and pour your favorite curry sauce over them. Garnish
  with minced cilantro and serve.
  
  Barbecue Grill: Prepare a charcoal fire to the gray-ash stage. Gently
  blow away the ash, leaving coals that glow cherry red. Cut paneer
  into 2-inch cubes. Brush skewers and paneer cubes with vegetable oil.
  Thread evenly on skewers leaving 1/2-inch space any cooked paneer
  recipe.
  
  For, an exotic appetizer, sprinkle grilled paneer cubes with. lemon
  juice and ground cumin. Place on a warmed platter and served
  immediately.
  
  Saute; Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a heavy nonstick pan or wok over
  medium-high heat. When oil is hot, add paneer cubes and saute until
  light brown, turning once. Carefully transfer to paper towels to
  drain. Tent with foil to keep warm until ready to use. Use in any
  recipe calling for cooked paneer.
  
  Note: A nonstick pan is essential; the paneer will break and crumble
  in any other pan.
  
  Deep Fry: Heat 6 tablespoons of vegetable or canola oil to 350
  degrees F. in a nonstick wok until hot but not smoking. Gently add
  Paneer cubes. Do not crowd. Fry, turning occasionally, until golden
  brown, about 5 minutes. Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper
  towels. Tent with foil to keep warm until ready to use. Use in any
  recipe calling for cooked paneer.

      Title: PEPPERED SEAFOOD SAUSAGE
 Categories: Appetizers, Seafood, Meats
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Fish Fillets
           Such As Sole, Flounder,
           Salmon Or Whitefish
           All One Kind Or Mixed
    1/2 lb Shrimp And/Or Scallops,
           Raw, Cleaned
    1/2 c  Packed Cilantro Leaves
      4 lg Egg Whites
      1 tb Fresh Lemon Juice
      2 ts Ground Cumin
      2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Ground Black Pepper
      5    Feet Hog Casing
           In A Continuous Length,
           Soaked In Cold Water For
           A Few Minutes *
 
  *Note: If hog casing is unavailable, seven 5- by 10-inch pieces of
  kitchen parchment may be used instead. See end of recipe for related
  info. ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- Cut the fish into long strips; the shrimp and
  scallops can remain whole. Put the seafood, jalapenos and cilantro
  through a coarse blade of a meat grinder.  Combine the ground seafood
  with the egg whites, lemon juice, cumin, salt and pepper in a large
  bowl. Rinse the hog casing in cold water by letting the water run
  from the tap directly through it. (The casing should not have any
  holes.)  Gather the casing up onto the sauce stuffing funnel
  attachment on your meat grinder. Put the seafood mixture back in the
  grinder and begin to grind it through. When it begins to emerge from
  the funnel, tie the end of the casing in a knot, leaving 3 inches of
  it unfilled for expansion room. Grind the mixture out, taking care
  not to overstuff the length of sausage; it should be about 1 inch
  wide. If necessary, squeeze it gently with your hands to make this
  width as you work. Continue with the entire length; you will have
  about 4 feet of sausage. Remove the funnel and use your finger to
  press out the last remaining seafood mixture. Leave 3 inches for
  expansion and tie the end in a knot. Shape to make it even. Coil it
  into a spiral and set it aside. Bring 1 inch of water to a boil in a
  large heavy skillet with a lid. Reduce the heat so that the water
  barely quivers. Prick the sausage with a sharp knife pint at 3-inch
  intervals.  Place it in the barely moving water, cover the pan and
  cook for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the sausage rest for
  10 minutes before serving. NOTE: If you use kitchen parchment, butter
  the paper and place 1/2 cup of the mixture on each piece. Roll it up,
  twist the ends and tie them securely with string. Poach as directed.

 Categories: Cookies and, Holidays, Sent to lis
      Yield: 45 Servings
 
      1 c  Stick Margarine, Softened
  1 1/2 c  Confectioner's Sugar
      1    Egg
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 ts Peppermint Extract
  2 1/2 c  All-Purpose Flour
      1 ts Baking Soda
      1 ts Cream Of Tartar
      1 ts Red Food Coloring
    1/4 ts Yellow Food Coloring
           Confectioners Sugar For
           -Sprinkling
 
  In large mixer bowl mix margarine, sugar, egg, vanilla, and peppermint
  extract. In a small bowl combine the flour, baking soda and cream of
  tartar. Blrnd into creamed mixture on low speed, scraping sides of
  bowl, until a soft dough is formed.
  
  Divide dough in half, removing one half to a small bowl. To the
  remaining hald add the red and yellow food colorings. Blend in to
  color all of that portion of the dough completely.
  
  Preheat oven to 375f.
  
  Working first with the plain uncolored dough, or having another
  person or child work with half of the dough, roll pieces of dough on
  counter or other flat surface to form "worm" or pencil shapes or
  various lengths. Begining in one corner and alternating the colors,
  place them diagonally in a jelly roll pan. The stripes should be
  close enough that when they are pressed down lightly they will touch.
  The dough is very forgiving and short "worms" can bw pinced together
  to form long ones in the pan. When the pan is full, press lightly to
  push strips together. Bake about 15 minutes at 375 until lightly
  golden brown.
  
  Cut immediately into sticks aproximately 1"x3". (depends on the pan!)
  Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar and store air tight.
  
  Cookies may be "crisped" in a warm oven if needed to freshen them.
  Sprinkle with fresh sugar after reheating.
  
  This dough may also be formed into cane shapes. Make pencil sized
  "worms" and twist together. Bend one end for cane shape. Bake and
  dust with confectioners sugar. Store as bar cookies.
  
  NOTES : The original version of this recipe  came from a Gold Medal
  Flour insert from the early 1970's.  It is a great "get the kids
  involved" recipe.  Dave and Juli both began helping for the "worms"
  for them at a very young age. It remains a favorite cookie for us
  all. I adapted the original recipe in flavoring and technique. The
  "worm" technique makes a more attractive cookie and makes it a fun
  project for the kids.

    200 g  Lebkuchen biscuits
      2 oz Ground hazlenuts
      5 oz Unsalted butter
  4 1/2 oz Caster sugar
      2    Eggs, size 1
      2 tb Ginger wine
           Crme frache (optional)
 
  You will need a 10in tart tin, preferably 1 1/2in deep, with a
  removable base; some baking parchment; dried baking beans.
  
  Preheat the oevn to gas mark 5, 375F, 190C.
  
  Put the flour, salt, sugar in the processor and whiz for a few
  seconds. Chop the butter roughly with a knife, add to the flour, and
  process for about 15 seconds until you have a rough, crumb-like
  mixture. In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolk and water together and
  then add to the flour and butter.  Whiz for about 30 seconds or until
  the pastry dough has left the sides of the bowl and is clinging in a
  solid mass around the central spindle.  Take out the pastry and
  lightly mould with your hands into a flattish round, so that later it
  will roll out more easily to the shape of the tart tin.  Wrap it in
  clingfilm and put in the fridge to rest for about 30 minutes or
  overnight.
  
  Take a scrap of butter and thoroughly grease the tart tin, paying
  special attention to the area where the base and sides meet. Roll out
  your pastry to the thickness of a chamois leather (you will have some
  surplus). Line the tart tin, making sure you do not strtch the
  pastry, by starting in the middle of the tin and draping the pastry
  gently and easily outwards towards the corners and then up the sides.
  Prick the base all over with a fork and put the tin back into the
  fridge for another 30 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, cut a piece of baking parchment to fit inside the pastry
  crust. Remove the pastry lined tin from the fridge, line with the
  baking parchment and sprinkle some beans over the bottom. Place in
  the preheated oven and bake for 15 minutes until the pastry has 'set'
  and is light golden. Remove from the oven, take out the parchment and
  beans, and return pastry crust to the oven for a further 3 minutes to
  colour the bottom. Then remove again and leave to cool, still in the
  tin.
  
  Put the biscuits in a food processor and whiz until coarse crumbs.
  Empty and combine the crumbs and ground hazelnuts in a bowl. Now put
  the butter and sugar in the food processor and cream together until
  smooth and fluffy. Beat the eggs in a small bowl until well mixed. To
  prevent the 'frangipane' curdling, first add about a third of the nut
  and crumb mixture to the creamed butter in the food processor and
  whiz for a few seconds until incorporated.  Carry on with the nut and
  crumbs, then egg, until everything is mixed in but do not over
  process. Finally, add the ginger wine or other liqueur.
  
  Peel the pears and cut them in half lengthways.  Core, but leave the
  stalks on.  Then make lengthways cuts down the pears, as if to fan,
  leaving the base intact. Now spoon in the frangipane mixture to cover
  the pastry case and place the pears on top with the stalks pointing
  towards the middle. Bake for 25 minutes at gas mark 3, 325F, 170C
  until golden brown and the mixture only just set - it's better if the
  mixture is still a little soft in the centre as it add a creamy
  texture to the finished tart. This is better eaten just warm rather
  than piping hot. Serve either plain or with a good dollop of crme
  frache.

      Title: PEPPERONI STICKS - ITALIAN STYLE
 Categories: Beef, Pork, Italian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  3 1/2 lb Salt
      5 oz Sugar
      4 oz Cure
      2 oz Ground hot red pepper
      2 oz Allspice
      5 oz Ground anise seed
     10 lb Ice water
 
  Ingredients for 100 lbs.
  
  Meat in Pounds Boneless cowmeat 50 pounds, Beef cheeks 20 pounds, Beef
  flanks or plates 30 pounds.
  
  Grinding and Mixing: Grind all the meats thru a 3/16" grinder plate.
  Remove to mixer and add all the ingredients mixing evenly, regrind
  thru 1/8" grinder plate. The meat is now ready for stuffing. Stuffing:
  
  It is essential that the meat is well chilled to avoid smearing the
  meat. The meat should be stuffed into 24 to 26 mm lamb casings.
  Smoking:
  
  Preheat smokehouse to 125 degrees F and place pepperoni in smoker.
  Have dampers wide open without smoke until the casings are dry. Close
  the dampers 1/4 open and apply a heavy smoke raising the temperature
  to 140 degrees.  Hold this temperature until the internal temperature
  of the product reaches 130 degrees. When using PORK, raise the
  temperature to 150 degrees and hold until the internal temperatue
  reaches 138 degrees. Remove from the smokehouse and chill with cold
  tap water until the internal temperature is reduced 105 degrees to
  110 degrees. Return to the cold smokehouse at 110 degrees and apply a
  heavy smoke for at least 12 hours or overnight. Leave dampers 1/4
  open.
  
  Drying: The drying room should be kept at 60 degrees to 65 degrees
  and a relative humidity of 70%.  The drying time will vary because of
  the amount of moisture that has been removed from the sausage during
  smoking. It usually takes 3 to 4 days to make a satisfactory
  pepperoni. When fully dry, the pepperoni will yield from 50 to 55% of
  the original product.
  
  Alternate Drying Method without smoking: Hold pepperoni at 70 degrees
  for about 2 days maintaining a relative humidity of about 75%. The
  product should be kept in a cooler for at least 20 days from the time
  the cure had been added to the pepperoni.  Be sure that casins used
  are not over 1-3/8" in diameter as this formula applies only to
  casings below this range.

      1 pk Dry yeast
      1 c  Warm water (105-115 deg.)
      2 c  All purpose flour
      1 c  Cake flour
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
      1 ts Coarsely ground pepper
 
  (Makes 1 loaf.)
  
  Sprinkle yeast over water in small bowl; stir to soften. Let stand
  until dissolved, about 5 minutes.
  
  Combine 2 cups all purpose flour, cake flour and salt in large bowl.
  Stir in yeast mixture and oil. Knead on floured surface until smooth
  and resilient dough forms, about 10 minutes, adding more flour if
  dough is sticky. Grease large bowl. Add dough, turning to coat entire
  surface. Cover bowl with plastic. Let dough rise in warm draft-free
  area until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.
  
  Line baking sheet with parchment. Punch dough down. Knead in cheese
  and pepper on lightly floured surface. Divide dough into 3 equal
  pieces. Roll between hands and surface into 14-inch ropes. Working on
  prepared sheet, braid ropes together beginning in center and working
  toward each end. Tuck ends under and pinch to seal. Cover with towel.
  Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until almost doubled in
  volume, about
        1    hour.
  
  Position rack in lower third of oven and line with baking tiles.*
  Preheat oven to 400 deg. for 30 minutes. Brush loaf with cold water.
  Slide loaf and parchment onto baking tiles. Bake 10 minutes. Mist
  oven with cold water, using spray bottle. Bake 10 minutes longer.
  Mist again. Continue baking until loaf is golden brown and sounds
  hollow when tapped on bottom, about 25 minutes. Cool on rack. This
  bread is best served the same day it is baked.

      3 tb Orange juice
      2 tb Lemon juice
      2 ts Garlic powder
      2 ts Ginger

      8    6 oz fish fillets (red
           Snapper, bass, turbot, or
           Orange roughy)

MMMMM-------------------------FOR SAUCE------------------------------
    1/2 c  Mayonnaise
    1/4 c  Chutney (like mango)
      1 tb Lemon juice
      1 ts Curry powder
 
  Heat over to 425 degrees and pour oil into 13x9 baking pan (or spray
  with Pam); tilt pan to coat evenly. In shallow bowl, mix butter,
  orange juice, lemon juice, garlic powder, ginger, red pepper flakes.
  Salt and pepper if desired. In shallow bowl, combine coconut and
  bread crumbs. Dip fish in butter mixture and coat with bread crumb
  mixture. Bake at 425 for 5 minutes. Turn fillets over; sprinkle with
  remaining mixture. Bake an additional 10-15 minutes or until fish is
  golden brown and flakes easily. Mix all sauce ingredients. Serve
  sauce over fish, garnish with lemon and parsley.
  
  Variation: 1-1/2 lbs of peeled, deveined, butterflied shrimp can be
  substituted. Combine the butter, orange juice, lemon juice, garlic
  powder, ginger and pepper flakes in a bowl. Add 1 tsp of coconut
  extract if you don't have coconut. Put the butterflied shrimp in the
  butter mixture and transfer to plain bread crumbs and toss to coat.
  Turn shrimp into a "Pam" sprayed pan, separating the ones that
  "hunked" together, then into the 425 oven for 5 minutes...flip with a
  spatula and another 10 minutes in the oven. If you don't have
  chutney, add extra lemon juice...it turns out fine.

      Title: PEPPERY CORN BREAD BITES
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1 pk (7 1/2 to 12 ounces)
           -cornbread muffin mix
    3/4 c  (3 ounces) shredded sharp
           -cheddar cheese
  1 1/2 ts Cracked black pepper
 
  I forget what kinds of recipes you like.  Here are a couple of easy
  looking cornbread recipes from a new book a friend gave me.
  
  From:  Working Mother 29-Minute Meals
  
  Preheat oven to 425 deg.F.  Grease 8-inch square baking pan. Prepare
  corn bread mix according to package directions, adding cheese to
  batter. Pour batter into prepared pan; sprinkle evenly with black
  pepper. Bake for 15 minutes, or until golden brown and toothpick
  inserted into center comes out clean. Cut corn bread into squares.
  
  Makes about 12 squares.
  
  Per square:  160 calories, 4 g protein, 6 g fat, 21 g carbohydrate,
  27 mg cholesterol, 348 mg sodium.
  
  This one also looks good.  From same book as above.
  
  Herbed Corn Bread
  
  Bake this savory cornbread in the morning and serve at room
  temperature--or if desired, reheat it briefly before serving.
  
  2 boxes (8 1/2-ounce size) cornbread or corn muffin mix 1/2 cup
  cottage cheese 1/4 cup minced parsley 1/4 cup snipped fresh chives or
  scallions
  
  1.  Preheat oven to 350 deg.F.  Grease several corn-stick molds or
  two 8 inch square baking pans. Set aside.
  
  2.  Prepare mixes according to package directions, adding cottage
  cheese, parsley and chives to batter. Spoon into prepared molds. Bake
  for 12 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned (corn bread baked in
  square pans will take about 25 minutes).
  
  Makes 12 servings.
  
  Per serving:  179 calories, 4 g protein, 5 g fat, 28 g carbohydrate,
  1 mg cholesterol, 455 mg sodium.
  
  My Note:  Even if you dislike cottage cheese, when cottage cheese is
  baked into breads and the like it looses its cottage-cheese-ness ;-)
  and just tends to make the breads moist. Also, you could probably add
  smidgens of other herbs to this last bread... tiny bits of basil or
  oregano or thyme, to give it just a hint of herby flavor.
  
  Take care, Kyosho

 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 45 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Molasses
      3 tb Butter or margarine, cut
           Into pieces
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Pepper
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 tb Plain yogurt
 
  "These extremely thin crackers have an intriguing balance of peppery
  snap and rich sweetness. They are addictive by themselves and make an
  elegant hors d'oeuvre when spread with herbed cream cheese. 350~F. 10
  to 15 minutes
  
  Combine the molasses and butter in a small sauce pan. Stir over low
  heat until the butter is melted. Remove from the heat and cool
  slightly.
  
  In the food processor or a large bowl, combine the flour, pepper, and
  salt and mix well. Stir the yogurt into the molasses mixture and then
  add to the flour mixture and blend to form a smooth dough.
  
  Remove the dough to a lightly-floured sheet of wax paper or lightly
  buttered aluminum foil and shape it into a log or cylinder
  approximately 1-1/2 inches thick and 12 inches long. Roll the log in
  the wax paper or foil and chill until firm, 45 minutes minimum.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350~F.
  
  When ready to bake, slice the log into 1/4-inch slices. Roll each
  slice with a floured rolling pin to form very thin ovals, about 1/16
  inch thick. The ovals may stick either to your rolling pin or to your
  rolling surface. Gently peel them off. Place the ovals on a lightly
  greased or parchemnt-lined baking sheet and prick each one 2 or 3
  times with the tines of a fork.
  
  Bake 10 to 15 minutes, until the crackers are medium brown. Those
  that are rolled slightly thinner than the others will brown first. Be
  ready to remove those from the sheet to cool while the others
  continue baking. Cool on racks. The crackers will crispen while
  cooling. Yield: 40-45.

      Title: PEPPY DILL WEDGES
 Categories: Pickles
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      4 c  Cucumber wedges quartered 1"
      2    Cloves garlic, optional
      2 tb Pickling salt
      2 c  Ice cubes
      1 c  Cider vinegar
      1 c  Water
      1 tb Dill seed
    1/2 ts Crushed red pepper
 
  Cut large cucumber lengthwise in quarters, then in 1" long pieces.
  
  Combine cucumber, garlic, if desired, and salt in a glass bowl. Cover
  with ice cubes.  Let stand in a cool place at least 6 hours or
  overnight. Drain well.
  
  Combine vinegar, water, dill seed and crushed red pepper in a
  saucepan. Bring to a boil.  Add drained cucumbers, return to boil.
  Cover and cook 2 min. Remove garlic cloves. Spoon into hot sterilized
  jars. Wipe jar rims. Seal.
  
  MY NOTE:  this recipe did not call for processing in a hot water bath
  so I made 1/2 batch and kept them in the fridge. Similar recipe in
  Bernardin Guide to Home Preserving calls for processing 10 minutes at
  altitudes up to 1000 ft.

  sheet of wax paper, lift sheet of wax paper holding sifted dry
  ingredients by sides and pour through sifter, sifting onto bare wax
  paper. Sift back and forth 3 times, then sift once more into large
  mixing bowl. Remove shortening from freezer. Cut into small bits,
  about 1/4-inch square. Drop shortening bits into bowl of dry
  ingredients and, using fingertips, lightly rub shortening and flour
  together, occasionally tossing flour mixture so you touch all
  particles of shortening with flour. When mixture has bits of
  flour-covered shortening throughout, begin adding buttermilk. Using
  fork, add buttermilk, lightly stirring to mix with dry ingredients.
  Cover board or surface with dusting of flour. Gather sticky mass of
  dough and place on floured surface. Dust hands with flour and gently
  knead dough, adding enough flour only to make dough manageable. Pat
  dough with hands or roll with floured rolling pin into round 1/2-inch
  thick. Using 2-inch cutter, cut out biscuits and place touching each
  other in 3 rows, in center of greased baking sheet. Place on middle
  rack of 425-degree oven and bake 12 minutes, or until lightly golden.
  Remove from oven and serve hot or warm. Makes 19 (2-inch round)
  biscuits. ***NOTE::By Marion Cunningham Thanks to Eula Mae Dore, a
  great Southern cook from Avery Plantation, La., I've learned to make
  the best Buttermilk Biscuits I've ever had. Eula Mae says a good
  biscuit is one of the best things to have on hand for quick meals.
  She uses them in emergencies to make simple sandwiches filled with
  scraps of ham or cheese and serves them with pickles and a small
  salad. For dessert, she warms a biscuit or two and makes a shortcake
  with fresh fruits or berries. She has convinced me that you can't
  have too many biscuits on hand. Eula Mae learned to cook and bake
  from her grandmother, not from cookbooks, and the artfulness of her
  preparation was a joy to watch. Here are some of her biscuit-making
  tips: + First go out and replace your baking powder, unless you
  bought it within the last four months. More baking flops occur from
  old, tired baking powder than from any other cause. And don't rely on
  the old test of checking the freshness of baking powder by putting a
  spoonful in a glass of water to see if it fizzes. Baking powder, like
  a carbonated drink, can fizz a little and still be almost flat.
  Buying new baking powder costs very little when you consider the cost
  of baking failures. + Next, Eula Mae insists that sifting the dry
  ingredients four times is the reason her biscuits are perfect. I
  tested the recipe sifting and not sifting and, indeed, sifting does
  make a slightly higher, more tender biscuit. + After you cut the
  biscuit dough, put the pieces on a baking sheet upside down. This
  ensures a taller, lighter biscuit by making sure any edges crimped by
  the pressure of the cutting don't interfere with the rise. (The
  French use the same trick when making puff pastry.) + The tip that
  helped me the most was using less flour than usual. Eula Mae's dough
  was soft and sticky. She handled it gently, dusting her hands and the
  dough with only enough flour to make the dough manageable. The result
  was a lighter biscuit.

      Title: PERFECT CHINESE STEAMED RICE
 Categories: Oriental
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Uncooked long-grain rice
  3 1/2 c  Water
 
  PUT THE RICE INTO A LARGE BOWL and wash it in several changes of water
  until the water runs clear. Drain the rice and put in a heavy pot
  with the water and bring to a boil. Continue boiling until most of
  the surface liquid has evaporated. This should take about 15 to 20
  minutes. The surface of the rice should have small indentations like
  a pitted crater. At this point, cover the pot with a very
  tight-fitting lid, turn the heat as low as possible and let the rice
  cook undisturbed for 15 to 20 minutes. There is no need to fluff the
  rice before serving it.

      Title: PERFECT CHOCOLATE CURLS
 Categories: Desserts, Chocolate
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    (or more) chocolate bars,
           -semisweet, white, milk or
           -bittersweet, each
      3 oz To 4 oz and about 1/4 inch
           -thick, unwrapped
 
  FROM:      Shelley Rodgers (Jolly Rodgers:the Portuguese Pirate!
  (1:161/202))
  
  Perfect chocolate curls?  You need patience and the right tool. Have
  perfect chocolate curls eluded you? With these tricks, success is
  assured.
  
  The secrets are the tool - a standard flexible-blade vegetable peeler
  ~ and the technique - getting chocolate to just the right
  temperature. White and milk chocolate curl most readily; dark
  chocolate can be finicky, though not too difficult to work with.
  
  ~=> Easy Chocolate Curls For a quantity of curls, warm each bar as
  you need it.  Use a regular oven if your microwave is 500 watts or
  less; lower-wattage microwaves can heat unevenly.
  
  Place chocolate, scored side down, on a sheet of cooking parchment or
  foil, uncovered, at full power (100%) until edges of chocolate give
  slightly to gentle fingertip pressure.  Warm for 15 seconds, check,
  then warm for 5 seconds at a time until chocolate tests as indicated.
  Total time will be 15-40 seconds, depending on oven's wattage and the
  kind of chocolate.
  
  In a conventional oven, place chocolate on foil on oven rack in a
  150~ oven until edges give slightly to gentle fingertip pressure, 1
  to 1-1/2 minutes.
  
  If chocolate gets too soft, let it cool for a few minutes.
  
  Set chocolate on paper or foil on a counter, aligning a long sdie of
  bar with counter edge; let paper or foil hang over edge. Stnad with
  your hip to the counter. With 1 hand, gently hold end of chocolate
  bar closest to you. With the other, hold peeler perpendicular to edge
  and rest blade on opoosite end of bar. Firmly and evenly, pull peeler
  toward you along bar, peeling off chocolate to make a curl.
  
  If chocolate strip splays out instead of curling, neaten it up with
  your fingers.  Some curls will wrap around themselves; other break
  off in short sections.
  
  With tip of peeler, lift each curl to a flat surface tocool and firm.
  Turn paper 180~ and repeat to make curls from poopsite long side of
  bar. As chocoalte bar gets thin, it's inclined to break; just pull
  peeler over smaller pieces.
  
  If chocolate is too firm to curl smoothly, or if it firms as you work,
  rewarm in a microwave oven on full power (100%) for 5-10 seconds at a
  time, or in a conventional oven at 150~ for 30 seconds.
  
  Save chocolate scraps for other uses.  [Note: I really can't believe
  they *really* put that last sentence in. *Scraps*? of chocolate???
  Get real.] If made ahead, store curls airthight up to 1 week. A
  3-ounce bar makes 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 ounces (1-1/2 to 2 cups) of curls. [

 Categories: Pasta, Italian, Lowfat, Lowcal
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 oz Dry pasta (any type)
           Salt
           Water
 
  1. Fill large stock pot with water (6 to 8 quarts). Pasta should have
  enough room to swim around freely. (you need at least 1 quart of
  water for each 4 oz. of dry pasta. 2. After water has come to a
  rolling boil, add salt (1 tablespoon per pound of dry pasta). DO NOT
  ADD OIL, it will make the sauce slide off. 3. Pour pasta in water and
  stir constantly until water returns to boiling. (Stirring prevents
  pasta from sticking together). 4. Start timimg the pasta once the
  water is boiling. As pasta cooks, Stir occasionally to keep it moving
  in the water. To determine doneness, scoop up a piece and bite into
  it. Pasta should be tender, yet resilient to the bite. Pasta should
  NEVER be cooked until mushy. 5. Drain pasta in a large collander in
  the sink. DO NOT RINSE THE PASTA, unless it is to be used in a salad.
  (The reason: Pasta needs the starch on the surface to mix with the
  sauce to thicken it). 6. Use 2 oz dry pasta for each serving.
  (Contains about 225 calories and no chol but lots of complex
  carbohydrates).

      Title: PERFECT PIE CRUST
 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  4 3/4 dl All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    170 g  Unsalted butter; chilled
     40 g  Margarine or veg. shortening
    1/2 dl Ice water (or as needed)
 
  *Note: If using vegetable shortening, it should be chilled.
  
  In a large bowl, sift the flour and salt.  Cut the chilled butter and
  margarine into 1 tablespoon bits and add to the flour. With a pastry
  cutter, work flour and shortening together until mixture resembles
  coarse meal.  Add the ice water little by little, pressing the pastry
  together into a ball.  Wrap and chill for at least 1 hour.
  
  (It is important to work the pastry as little as possible. Don't
  overhandle.  A secret to light, flaky pastry is to keep the mixture
  cool, add as little water as possible, and mix only as much as
  necessary.)
  
  If pastry has been chilled for a long time, let it sit at room
  temperature for at least 15 minutes before rolling.
  
  Lightly flour a pastry board, marble counter, or kitchen counter.
  Divide the pastry in half.  Pat each piece of pastry into a flat
  round. Lightly flour rolling pin. Roll pastry in one direction only,
  turning pastry continually to prevent it from sticking to the surface.
  
  Using pie plate as a guide, measure rolled-out pastry ~ it should be
  slightly larger than the pie plate and 1/8-inch (2 mm) thick. Fold
  rolled pastry circle in half so you can lift it more easily. Unfold,
  gently fitting the pastry into the pie plate, allowing pastry to hang
  evenly over the edges.  Do not trim the pastry yet.
  
  Fill the pie with filling.  The roll out the second crust in the same
  manner as for bottom.  Fold circle in half and with a sharp, pointed
  knife cut little vents in a decorative pattern. Place folded pastry
  on one half the pie.  Unfold, pressing top and bottom pastry
  together. Trim edges with scissors, leaving a 1/2-inch (1 cm)
  overhang. Fold bottom pastry overhang over top and press firmly to
  seal.  Crimp rim, using fingers or the tines of a fork.

      Title: PERFECT PIE CRUST (LF)
 Categories: Low-fat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  + 2 T all-purpose unbleached
           -flour;
    1/4 c  Whole-wheat flour;
      3 tb Cold margarine; cut into
           -small pieces
      3 tb To 4 T ice water;
      2 c  Dried beans; washed, or
           -pie weights;
 
  Preheat oven to 450F.  Lightly coat an 8-inch pie pan with nonstick
  cooking spray.  Combine 1/2 c of the unbleached flour with the whole
  wheat flour in a bowl, or in a food processor bowl, and add the
  margarine. In the bowl, use a fork to crumble the flour and margarine
  into a coarse mixture. In the food processor, use the metal chopping
  blade and pulse the machine 10-12 times to cut the margarine into
  small pieces. As you form the mixture, add the ice water, 1 tbspoon
  at a time, until the lumps appread moist. Transfer the dough to a
  board, and lightly knead it for 1 minute. Form into a ball, place in
  a small bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 10
  minutes. Sprinkle the remaining 2 tbspoons of flour on a pastry board
  and lightly coat the rolling pin with flour. On the floured board
  roll the pie dough out in a circle slightly large than your pie pan.
  Carefully transfer the dough to the prepared pie pan. Crimp the edges
  of the dough against the rim of the pie pan. You can use this unbaked
  pie shell in many recipes, except for fruit fillings. If you make a
  fruit-filled pie, you must pre-bake the shell so the fruit juices
  won't make it soggy. To pre-bake it, cover the crust with tinfoil,
  place 2 cups of clean beans or pie weights in the center of the
  crust, and bake for 10 minutes. YIELD: Makes 1 8-inch pie shell -
  Serving 8.

      Title: PERFECT ROAST CHICKEN ZUNI CAFE
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    2 3/4 - 3 lb Free Range
           Chicken
           (Chicken should be yellow;
           Not pale white)
 
  Trim the fat.  Remove giblets.  Slip two peeled garlic cloves and a
  sprig of fresh marjoram (you can use any herb - except rosemary)
  under the skin of the breast on each side.
  
  Generously sprinkle kosher salt and pepper all over the bird, very
  generous with the salt.  Then, refrigerate overnight (usually they
  let it sit for 24 hours).
  
  Zuni Cafe roasts the chicken in a beehive oven made of brick over a
  wood fire, oak and almond or apple, for a special smoky taste which
  can't be replicated at home.
  
  Place the chicken on a pan (you can use a rack if you like so the
  juices fall down into the pan) and cook it for approximately 25 - 40
  minutes depending on the oven temperature. The oven temperature
  should be as hot as you can get it -- maybe 450 - 500 degrees. When
  the juices run clear and the chicken is brown, it is done. The
  important thing is to keep an eye on the chicken so it doesn't over
  cook.
  
  Let the chicken sit for awhile (5 min.), cut it up and Enjoy!!!

      Title: PERFECT SAFFRON PASTA
 Categories: Pasta, Italy, Herb/spices
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           PERFECT SAFFRON PASTA
 
  Makes about 2/3 pound, 4 to 6 servings.
  
  The rich flavor and aroma of this pasta are wonderful with fish and
  shellfish in a broth, wine, or cream sauce, or with sauteed chicken.
  It stands up well to sauces that have the strong flavor of olives and
  acid ingredients such as wine and tomatoes. Try Saffron Pasta with
  sweet peppers, garlic, and onions or leeks. Here, we shape it into
  bow ties, called farfalle (''butterflies") in Italian.
  
  2 teaspoons saffron threads, firmly packed 1 tablespoon hot water 2
  cups unbleached flour 2 extra-large eggs
  
  In a small bowl, combine the saffron and the watcr and let stand 10
  minutes. If you are making the pasta by hand, add the saffron and
  water to the eggs after you have beaten them lightly with a fork. If
  you are making the pasta in a food processor, add the saffron water
  to the work bowl aftcr you have added the eggs. Proceed according to
  the directions for Egg Pasta (please see the recipe "Perfect Pasta").
  
  After rolling the dough through the next-to-last setting on the pasta
  machine, cut it into 1-by-2-inch rectangles with a fluted ravioli
  cutter or knife. With your thumb and forefinger, pinch the centers of
  the rectangles together to make bow ties and set them on tea towels
  or a lightly floured surface.
  
  FETA, CHIVES & PISTACHIOS W/ SAFFRON PASTA
  
  Serves 4 to 6.
  
  Bright and beautiful, golden bow ties are dressed with chopped chives
  and pistachios. Serve them as a side dish or a light but satisfying
  main course.
  
  Water 6 ounces feta cheese, crumbled 1/3 cup roasted, shelled, and
  peeled pistachios, coarsely chopped 1/3 cup chopped Chives 3
  tablespoons currants, softened in hot water and drained 2 tablespoons
  extra-virgin olive oil Salt 1 batch Saffron Pasta Freshly ground
  black pepper
  
  In a large pot, bring several guarts of water to a boil. Meanwhile,
  place the cheese, pistachios, chives, currants, and olive oil in a
  large saute pan.
  
  When the water comes to a boil, salt it well, add the pasta, and cook
  it al dente. Drain it, reserving about 1/2 cup of the cooking water.
  Add the drained pasta to the saute pan along with enough of the
  reservcd cooking water to make a sauce that just coats the noodles.
  Season with salt and pepper and toss well. If desired, you may
  drizzle the top lightly with olive oil. Serve hot.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Warm Water
      1 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Ginger
      2 pk Active or Dry Yeast
    1/3 c  Sugar
  2 1/2 c  Warm water
      4 c  Flour
    3/4 c  Skimmed Milk Powder
      3 c  Warm Water
      5 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Soft Lard
      8 c  Flour (for the Dough)
      2 c  Flour (for kneading)
 
  Combine the first 4 ingredients and let stand in a warm place until
  bubbling nicely. In a large bowl, stir together 1/3 cup Sugar, 2 1/2
  cups Water, 4 cups flour, and 3/4 cup dried skim milk. Stir in the
  yeast mixture, beating well. Cover the bowl and let stand in a warm
  place until the sponge is well risen and bubbly. Add 3 cups warm
  water, 5 teaspoons salt, and 1/2 cup lard and beat well. Stir in 6 to
  8 cups flour, mixing until the dough clears the bowl. Spread the
  remaining 2 cups of flour on a pastry board, turn out the dough and
  knead well, using a little additional flour if necessary to make it
  smooth and satiny. Return to the bowl, dust top of dough with flour,
  cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place for about 30
  minutes. Turn out. Knead thoroughly, using only enough flour to keep
  dough from sticking. Divide into 6 even portions. Shape into loaves.
  Place in greased pans. Brush tops of loaves with soft lard and allow
  to rise again until double in bulk. Bake in PREHEATED oven for 45
  minutes; the first 20 minutes at 425 F.; then reduce heat to 350 F.
  for the rest of the baking period. If a very soft crust is desired,
  brush top of loaves with melted lard or butter as soon as they are
  removed from the oven and allow to stand for about 5 minutes before
  removing from the pans. This recipe makes 6 medium size loaves.

 Categories: Personal, Better
      Yield: 24 Oz
 
MMMMM---------------------CHEAPER AND BETTER--------------------------
      2 c  Cornstarch
      1 c  Rice flour
      1 ts Orrisroot powder
           Several drops perfume or
           -essential oil
 
  Easy and inexpensive. Clouds of fragrance. Rice powder is available
  from health food stores and orrisroot powder from a pharmacy.
  
  Mix all and store the powder in a tightly closed tin for 1 WEEK so
  that the orrisroot powder will absorb the scent. Transfer to other
  containers of your choice if desired.
  
  Ideas: Can be sprinkled from the kind of big shaker that is normally
  used in the kitchen. For a special gift, cover a box with an antique
  style of paper, add a pretty puff topped with a fancy bow.
  
  Variations: An especially nice powder can be made by omitting any
  fragrance from the recipe, and adding 1/2t vanilla to the powder and
  1-2 vanilla beans. Store in a tightly closed tin. Or, sprinkle a cup
  of rose petals into the mixture, cover, and let the roses scent the
  powder. 24 oz Typed by Sherilyn Schamber

        1 lb stew meat  -- (lamb or
  :          beef)
        2 sm pumpkin  -- or 1 med-small
  :          pumpk
      1/2 c  dried prunes
        3 TB tomato paste
        1 ts turmeric
      1/8 ts cinnamon
      1/2 md onion  -- chopped
  :          salt and pepper to taste
        1 pn saffron disolved in 1/4c.
  :          warm water  -- optional
  
  Brown the meat and add about 1 and 1/2 cups water. Add tomato paste,
  turmeric, cinnamon, saffron and salt and pepper and sauteed onion.
  Cook covered ata simmer for about 1 and 1/2 to two hours. Meat should
  be tender and nearly falling apart stage.  You may need to add water
  during cooking but you shouldn't end up with more than the stated
  amount. You don't want a watery stew. In the meantime, seed the
  pumpkin and slice into 2X2 inch pieces and peel.  Brown on both sides
  in corn oil. The pumpkin should become brown in some places and
  somewhat flexible but not totally cooked. Add to meat and cook
  covered an additional 20-30 minutes until tender but not falling
  apart.  A fork should go into the pumpkin easily but not break it up.
  Add the prunes the last 5 minutes of cooking. They shouldn't really
  cook too much but should get warm. Serve over hot basmatic rice. Note
  on pumpkin: ~--------------- Baking pumpkins are the best since they
  are sweeter and less stringy.  I have used jack o lantern pumpkins
  when feeling frugal and the dish was still good. You want about twice
  the volume of meat in peeled pumpkin slices.

    1/4 ts Ground saffron; dissolved in

    1/3 c  Yellow split peas

      3 c  Basmati rice
      8 c  ;Water
      2 tb Salt
    3/4 c  Butter; melted
    1/2 ts Saffron; dissolved in
      2 tb ;Water, hot
      2 tb Yogurt (opt)
 
  In large pot, brown onions in 3 Tbsp. of oil or butter. Add meat and
  brown. Add salt, pepper, and cinnamon. Add water, cover and simmer
  over low heat for 1 hr, stirring occasionally.
  
  Wash, but don't peel quinces.  Use apple corer to remove seeds. Slice
  as for apple pie.  In skillet, saute in 2 Tbsp. oil or butter and set
  aside.
  
  To the meat, add sugar, vinegar or lemon juice, saffron, split peas,
  and quince.  Cover and simmer 35 minutes. Check to see that meat and
  fruit are cooked. Taste and correct seasoning. Transfer to deep
  casserole dish and keep in warm oven until ready to serve. Serve hot
  with chelo (recipe below.)
  
  (Note: I am giving the detailed instructions for chelo. I don't use
  the yogurt and I drizzle the remaining saffron over *all* the rice. I
  also serve the tah dig(crust) with the rest of the rice.)
  
  Chelo:  Wash rice 5 times in cold water.  Bring water and salt to
  boil in a large non-stick pan.  Add washed and drained rice. Boil 6
  minutes, stirring gently twice to loosen grains that may have stuck
  to bottom. Drain rice in colander and rinse in lukewarm water.
  
  In same pot, heat half the butter, 2 Tbsp. hot water, a drop of
  dissolved saffron, and yogurt.  Taking one spatula at a time, place
  rice gently in pot mounding in the shape of a pyramid.
  
  Dissolve remaining butter in 2 Tbsp. hot water and pour over rice.
  Place clean dishtowel over pot and cover firmly with lid to prevent
  steam from escaping. Cook 10 minutes over medium heat and 50 minutes
  over low heat. Remove from heat.
  
  Allow to cool 5 minutes on a damp surface without removing lid. Put 2
  Tbsp. of the rice in with remaining saffron and set aside for
  garnish. Gently remove rice from pot without disturbing crust.
  Sprinkle saffron flavored rice over top and serve. Detach crust and
  serve separately.

  Persimmon Puree: You'll need fully ripe pointed-tip persimmons--pulp
  should be soft and jelly like. Cut fruits in half and scoop out pulp
  with a spoon. Discard skin, seeds, and stem.  In a blender or food
  processor, whirl pulp, a portion at a time, until smooth (you'll need
  2 or 3 med. size persimmons for 1 cup puree). For each cup puree,
  thoroughly stir in 1-1/2 tsp. lemon juice. To store, freeze in 1-cup
  batches in rigid containers; thaw, covered, at room temperature.
  
  Prepare persimmon puree; measure out 1 cup and stir in baking soda.
  Set aside.  In a large bowl, lightly beat egg; then stir in sugar,
  oil, and dates.
  
  In another bowl, stir together flour, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and
  cloves; add to date mixture alternately with persimmon mixture,
  stirring just until blended. Stir in walnuts. Spread batter evenly in
  a lightly greased, flour-dusted 10 by 15-inch rimmed baking pan. Bake
  in a 350 degrees F oven for 25 minutes or until top is lightly
  browned and a pick inserted in center comes out clean.
  
  Let cool in pan on a rack for 5 minutes.  Prepare Lemon Glaze: In a
  small bowl, stir together 1 cup powdered sugar and 2 tbs. lemon juice
  until smooth. Spread over cookies. Let cool completely; then cut into
  2 by 2-1/2 inch bars. Store covered. Makes 2-1/2 dozen.

      2 tb Flour
      1 c  Sugar
      2 tb Unsalted butter; melted
      4    Egg yolks
      1    Egg; whole
      1 ts Vanilla extract

MMMMM----------------STICKY PECAN PRALINE CRUMBLE---------------------
      2 c  Pecan halves or pieces
      1 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Water
    1/8 ts Cream of tartar
 
  For best results, persimmons must be riper than you think they are.
  They ripen best at room temperature, points up -- no bags, no
  ripening bowls. When they look rotten, shriveled, and feel like
  there's jelly under their skins, they're ready. This can take weeks.
  
  PERSIMMON FILLING: Set oven rack in the center of the oven and
  preheat oven to 450'F. Scoop persimmon pulp out of skins, discarding
  seeds and leaves. Puree pulp in a food processor or blender.
  
  Whisk together cream, flour, sugar, and melted butter. Beat together
  the yolks, the whole egg, and the vanilla and whisk into cream
  mixture. Fold in persimmon pulp. Pour filling into pie shell. Top
  with a handful (about 1/2 cup) of praline crumble.
  
  Bake 10 minutes at 450'F. Reduce heat to 350'F and bake 50 minutes to
  1 hour more. Rotate pie if crust begins to overbrown, or cover rim
  with a foil strip. Filling will nearly boil when done.
  
  FOR STICKY PECAN PRALINE CRUMBLE: Toast pecans on a cookie sheet at
  350'F about 10 to 15 minutes, tossing them a few times. (Nuts will
  start to smell toasted when they need to come out of the oven.)
  Butter another cookie sheet and set aside.
  
  In a heavy saucepan, bring sugar, water, and cream of tartar to a
  boil over medium-high heat. (If crystals form on the sides of the
  pan, cover the pan for 30 seconds or as long as 5 minutes so steam
  rinses off the sides.) When the sugar darkens, you may swirl the pan
  to even the color. As caramel turns the color of light hay, remove
  from heat. Don't let the caramel get too dark, or the sugar will be
  too brittle to crumble, and it will snap instead.
  
  Using a wooden spoon, stir in toasted nuts, mixing to coat them very
  well. Spread caramel-coated nuts out on the buttered cookie sheet,
  cool 1 hour, then chop coarsely with a knife (a food processor causes
  the caramel to stick and clump).
  
  You can store the surplus in a tightly covered jar at room
  temperature for three months.

      Title: PERSIMMON FUDGE
 Categories: Candies, Fruit
      Yield: 10 Dozen
 
      6 c  Sugar
      2 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Cream
    1/2 c  Light corn syrup
  1 1/4 c  Persimmon pulp (4-5 fruits)
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter
      1 c  Chopped fresh dates
      2 c  Finely chopped nuts
 
  In a large, heavy pot, mix sugar, milk, cream, corn syrup, and
  persimmon pulp. Cook over low heat, stirring frequently, for 45
  minutes to 1 hour, or until mixture reaches the soft-ball stage
  (235-240'F). Meanwhile, butter a 9x13-inch baking pan.
  
  When fudge is the proper temperature, remove from heat and cool in
  the pan until barely warm. Using a wooden spoon, beat in the butter.
  When mixture thickens and butter is absorbed, add dates.
  
  Spread fudge in the prepared pan. When completely cool, cut into small
  squares. (If desired, squares may be rolled into balls and then
  rolled in chopped nuts.) Chill 1 day. May freeze 3 weeks.
  
  NOTE: To prepare persimmons, scoop soft persimmon pulp out of skins,
  discarding seeds and leaves. Puree in a food processor or blender.
  
  How to chop dates: Chop with a chef's knife (with a blade 6 to 8
  inches long) dusted with powdered sugar to keep dates from sticking.
  Or cut dates with scissors.

      Title: PESACH HAZELNUT-CHOCOLATE VIENNESE TORTE)
 Categories: Chocolate, Tortes
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      6 lg Eggs -- 5 of them separated
        pn Salt
      2 ts Lemon juice
    3/4 c  Sugar -- divided
      2 ts Lemon rind -- grated
      3 oz Semisweet Chocolate -- very
           Finely grated
  2 1/2 c  Unblanched nuts -- very
           Finely ground (
           For Torte:
    1/4 c  Sweet Pesach wine
    1/2 c  Apricot jam
           Chocolate Glaze:
    1/3 c  Water
      3 tb Vegetable oil
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Cocoa
           Garnish: (optional)
      1 c  Nuts -- ground
     12    Hazelnuts
      1 oz Chocolate -- for curls
 
  Grease a 9 inch springform pan well and coat it with potato starch or
  sugar, tapping out excess.
  
  For the batter, in a large mixing bowl, beat the 5 egg whites with
  the salt and lemon juice until foamy. Very gradually add 1/4 cup
  sugar and continue beating the whites until they form stiff, but not
  dry, peaks.
  
  Use the same beaters and another bowl to beat the 5 egg yolks and
  additional egg with the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and lemon rind until
  very light and fluffy.  Gently but thouroughly fold the beaten whites
  into yolks.  Fold in chocolate and nuts, and pour batter into pan.
  
  Bake torte in a preheated 325 degree oven for 50-55 minutes or until
  top springs back when gently pressed.
  
  [this will not rise as much as you think it ought. Don't worry about
  it]
  
  Leave the torte in the oven, turn off the heat, and open the door
  slightly. After 10 minutes remove torte from oven. Run a knife around
  the edge of the torte to release it from the pan rim.  Cool it for
  another 30 minutes in the pan. Remove the pan rim and cool the torte
  completely on the bottom.
  
  [This next part is for icing the Torte.  What I've done in the past
  is make 2 layers, following the above directions, doubled the amount
  of raspberry syrup and dribbled half over each torte as per the
  directions and skipped the jam. I've then used the chocolate glaze as
  an icing for between the layers, and the "Instant" Chocolate Mousse
  recipe for the outside icing of the whole thing.  ]
  
  Cover a 9 or 10 inch cardboard circle with heavy duty aluminum foil or
  freezer paper or use a cake plate. Invert torte onto base and remove
  pan bottom. Sprinkle wine [or whatever] evenly over torte. Heat jam
  until thinned; then bruch or spread it all over the torte. (this adds
  flavor and smooths the surface).
  
  For the glaze, combine the water, oil, sugar, and cocoa in a small
  suacepan and mix very well.  Cook the mixture over low heat, stirring
  constantly, for 10-14 minutes, or until the glaze thickens slightly
  and is very smooth and shiney.  For the best flavor and texture it
  should not boil. Remove glaze from heat and stir 3-4 minutes longer
  until it cools slightly and gets a bit thicker. Pour all the glaze in
  the center of the torte and immediately use a metal or rubber spatula
  to evenly spread it all over top and sides.  Wipe up any drips from
  base.
  
  Let torte rest a few minutes until the glaze begins to set, but is
  still soft.
  
  Press handfulls of ground nuts all over the sides, but not the top.
  Arrange whole nuts, evenly spaced in circle on top about 1 inch from
  edge. Heap chocolate curls or bits in center.
  
  Refrigerate the uncovered, completed torte for several hours or,
  preferably, overnight so the glaze will set and the flavors and
  textures will "mellow".
  
  (Once the glaze has set, the torte can be frozen for up to 3 weeks.
  Freeze it uncovered, then wrap it in plastic wrap or tin foil. Unwrap
  it before thawing and thaw for several hours in the refrigerator.

           1/2 lemon
      1 tb Matzoh cake meal
      3 tb Water, approximately
 
  To poach the fish, combine the water, lemon juice, parsley, salt and
  pepper in a large deep skillet. Add the fish fillets, in one layer if
  possible. Bring the liquid to a boil, then lower the heat and cover
  the skillet. Simmer the fish for 5-10 minutes, or until it is just
  cooked through but not falling apart. (If the fillets are thick,
  carefully turn them once during the poaching). Use a slotted spoon to
  transfer the fish to a deep serving dish. Reserve the broth. For the
  sauce, beat the eggs and lemon juice together in a medium bowl. In a
  small bowl, mix the cake meal and water to make a creamy paste. Stir
  the paste into the egg-lemon mixture. Then gradually stir in about
  1/2 cup of the hot fish broth. Stirring constantly, add all the
  egg-lemon mixture back into the hot fish broth and stir over low heat
  until the sauce has thickened. Adjust the seasoning, if necessary.
  pour the sauce over the fish. Serve hot or, as is more customary,
  refrigerate the fish and the sauce and serve them chilled.

 Categories: Fish, Mexican
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
           Skinless fillets of any
           Mild white fish
           Flour
           Clarified butter
           A LOT of garlic)
           Juice of one lime
           Additional lime wedges
 
  Use only Clarified butter (don't think of using margarine)
  
  Dust the fillets lightly with flour.  Meanwhile, heat some of the
  clarified butter in a frying pan until hot but not smoking. Saute the
  fish until lightly browned (some Mexican cooks fry fish until it is
  the approximate consistancy of our potato chips <crisps>, but I feel
  this is taking authenticity a bit too far
  :-).
  
  Remove the fish from the pan, and add additional butter if needed
  (you will want about 2-3 Tbsp. of melted butter per fillet to sauce
  the finished dish). Add garlic to the pan and saute garlic until it
  is a light brown color.  Do not allow it to burn, but do allow the
  garlic to take on some color and become slightly crisp. Squeeze in
  the lime juice.
  
  Pour the hot butter/garlic mixture over the fish, and serve.
  
  This dish is quite common in Southern Mexico, and traditionally would
  be served with black beans (either whole or refried); perhaps a
  simple dish of rice, cooked in chicken broth with chopped cilantro
  and a few diced green chiles; a side relish of homemade fresh salsa
  (see Pico de Gallo).

 Categories: Seafood, Mexican
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    Groupers or red snappers
           -(about 2 1/2 pounds each)
 
  Yield: 6 servings
  
  _One_day_ahead_:
  
  Do not have the scales removed from the fish.  Have the heads and
  tails removed and the fish opened out flat in one piece. Remove the
  backbone. 1 tablespoon ground achiote (annato) seeds Available in the
  Latin American food section of most supermarkets and Latin American
  and Carribean markets. 1/4 teaspoon peppercorns 1 1/2 teaspoons salt,
  or to taste 1/4 teaspoon oregano, lightly toasted in a small frying
  pan 1/4 teaspoon hot paprika 3 cloves garlic, peeled 1/4 cup Seville
  orange juice, or mild white vinegar
  
  In a blender or food processor, blend all the ingredients together to
  a smooth paste.  Spread the paste over the flesh of the fish and set
  it aside to season for several hours of every night.
  
  _On_serving_day_:
  
  Brush the seasoned side of the fish with a little olive oil and cook
  it, seasoned side down, over the charcoal or under the broiler for
  about 10 minutes.
  
  Turn the fish over and cook it on the skin side for a slightly longer
  period or until the flesh is _just_ cooked through - about 15 to 20
  minutes, depending on the fish.
  
  Serve the fish hot with fresh tortillas, so that everyone can make
  his own tacos, with small dishes of the following served separately:
  
  Toasted oregano Chopped chiles habaneros or cayennes Sliced avocado
  Pickled onion rings (does anybody really want this recipe!?) Sliced
  tomato Sliced Seville oranges

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6    To 8 slices fresh fish
           -fillets
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1 tb Tarragon leaves, crumbled
    1/4 c  Lime juice
           Butter (enough for baking
           -dish)
      2    Fresh tomatoes, peeled and
           -chopped
      3    Very ripe avocados, mashed
      2 tb Onions, minced
      4 ts Chili powder (more or less)
  2 1/2 tb Parsley, minced
      1    Clove of garlic, crushed
      1 tb Olive oil
     13    Black olives, pitted
      1 cn Sweet red peppers, cut into
           -strips
 
  Had an outstanding weekend at sales this time, including some neat
  cookbooks++a Danish one, a Mexican one, an Appalachian one, along
  with a small Mongolian Firepot and about two grand worth of software
  that I got for thirty bucks.  Things like Ventura publisher and a
  complete LAN setup including the hardware.  The guy having the sale
  said "Thank God someone came along who knows what this stuff is!" I
  was just thankful I got there first!.  No ridged skillet yet and I
  still haven't found a good wok for Alison, but the sales are really
  picking up again now that spring is here.
  
  Stumbled across this recipe in one of the books and thought it might
  be of at least passing to ya...  ;-} Maybe make it with some nice
  fresh salmon?
  
  Season fish with salt, pepper, and tarragon leaves and soak in lime
  juice for a few minutes.  Set the oven at 375F and bake fish in
  buttered baking dish until it flakes easily when pierced with a fork,
  about 25 minutes.
  
  While fish is baking, combine tomatoes, parsley, avocado, garlic,
  minced onion, oil chili powder, salt and pepper to taste. (We suggest
  tasting the guacamole as the chili powder is added, so that you can
  get just the degree of heat you desire.)
  
  Spread the above mixture over the cool fish.  Garnish with black olive
  rings and strips of sweet red pepper.
  
  Makes 6 to 8 servings.

  add the nuts. Pesto is a pungent Italain sauce made from ground-up
  basil, pine nuts, and Parmesan cheese.  It used to be available only
  in the summer when fresh basil is plentiful. Now you can buy it in
  most grocery stores bottled, in the refrigerator case, or even in a
  tube. Home made may be the best, but store bought is just fine.

  Grill outside until 3/4 done or bake in a 350deg oven for 15 minutes.
  
  Make sure 1/2 c sundried tomatoes are in a 1-c container. Fill

  Chop chicken into bite-sized pieces. Cover and set aside.
  
  When sundrieds have reconstituted, chop coarsely (at least chop each
  tomato in half, depending on how much tomato you can handle in one
  bite)
  
  Prepare pizza dough. Spread with a decent amount (not light, not
  heavy) of pesto to 1/3 inch from edge of crust. You may want to
  initially brush entir surface of dough liberally with olive oil,
  depending on your taste.
  
  Strategically place chopped chicken and sundried tomatoes over
  surface of pesto. Sprinkle half of the mushrooms on top of all this.
  
  Cover with cheese.
  
  Sprinkle remaining mushrooms on surface of cheese.
  
  Bake at 375 until crust is golden and cheese is bubbly and hinting at
  turni golden.
  
  Do not initially overbake chicken, or you will have bite-sized pieces
  of leather on your pizza. I know, I got "gourmet" pizza last night
  suffering f this affliction.

      Title: PESTO PASTA
 Categories: Pasta, Sauces
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------PASTA--------------------------------
      3 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
      2 lg Eggs; lightly beaten with
    1/4 c  Pesto Sauce

MMMMM------------------------PESTO SAUCE-----------------------------
      2 md Garlic cloves
      2 c  Fresh basil leaves; packed
    1/2 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
    1/2 c  Feta cheese; crumbled
           (about 3 oz.)
    1/4 c  Walnuts; chopped
 
  For The Pasta:
  
  Following the instructions given in your owner's manual, prepare and
  set up the pasta machine with an extruder die to make the disired
  shape of pasta.
  
  All ingredients must be at room temperature. Place the liquid
  ingredients in a glass measuring cup. If less than 3/4 cup, add some
  water to make up the balance.
  
  Add the dry ingredients to the pasta machine mixing bowl. Switch the
  pasta machine on. Slowly pour the liquid ingredients through the feed
  tube. Mix for approximately 3 minutes, or until the dough appears to
  be coming together in soft pea-sized crumbs.
  
  Following the instructions given in your owner's manual, begin to
  extrude the dough. Cut off the first 2 to 3 inches extruded and
  discard. As the pasta begins to come out, gently move it away from
  the machine. Cut with a sharp paring knife or scissors at desired
  lengths. Place extruded pasta on a wire rack or on a clean kitchen
  cloth. Let sit for at least 30 minutes before cooking, or store for
  later use.
  
  For The Pesto Sauce:
  
  Put the garlic, basil leaves, and olive oil in a blender jar or food
  processor bowl. Process until smooth. Add the feta cheese and walnuts
  and process just until the cheese is blended into the mixture. The
  sauce should have the same consistency as heavy cream. If too thick,
  add additional oil or water, a tablespoon at a time.
  
  The recipe for the Pesto Sauce makes enough for 4 servings when used
  as a pasta sauce, which by the way, it pretty darn good!
  
  Both recipes are from the book 'The Ultimate Pasta Machine Cookbook'
  by Tom Lacalamita  Simon & Schuster ISBN# 0-671-50102-X.

      Title: PETE'S UNUSUAL BLACK BEAN CHILI
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 c  Black Beans, dried
      1 ea Green Pepper, chopped
      2 tb Olive Oil
      2 tb Ground Cumin
    1/3 ts Ground Cinnamon
      4 ea Garlic Cloves, minced
      1 ts Fresh Ginger, grated
      1 tb "Squeet" Smoke Flavoring
     16 oz Can, Crushed Tomatoes
      1 x  Cayenne Pepper, to taste
  1 1/2 lb Lean Ground Chuck
      2 ea Medium Onions, chopped
      4 tb Paprika
    1/4 ts Ground Nutmeg
      1 ts Oregano
      3 tb Molasses
      2 tb Cocoa Powder
      8 oz Can, Tomato Sauce
      1 cn Tomato Paste, small
      1 x  Chicken Stock
 
  In a fairly large pot, brown the ground chuck, draining off any fat
  when finished browning. Simultaneously, saute the chopped onions,
  garlic and green pepper in the oil in a separate pan -- I find if you
  try to saute them with the beef, they give up too much moisture to
  it, and it really doesn't brown enough -- it just "grays" . Add the
  sauted onion, garlic, and green pepper to the browned meat, along
  with all the other ingredients. Dilute it to the desired thickness
  with the chicken stock -- or some beer. Simmer for an hour or two,
  covered. You may want to uncover for the last half-hour or so if you
  think it has thinned out more than you expected -- sometimes the
  tomatoes release juice as they cook. Particularly good with corn
  bread. And even better the next day.

  BLACK BEANS THE EASY WAY
  
  My chili recipe calls for the end result of starting with 2 cups of
  dried black beans, and preparing them as you will. There are plenty
  of cookbooks full of instructions for soaking overnight, etc., but I
  do it the easy way.
  
  My way is to pressure cook them, which only takes 45 minutes after the
  steam release hisses the first time. Just rinse two cups of dried
  black beans well, and put them in the pressure cooker with at least 4
  cups of water. Seal it, heat until the steam release hisses the first
  time: then, turn down the heat to medium-low, and start your timer
  for 45 minutes. Steam release should hiss every few minutes or so.
  When they're finished cooking, drain them, and they're ready for the
  chili pot.Copyright 1992 by Peter A. Vogt

  salt, and pine nuts in a food processor or blender and process until
  coarsely chopped and well mixed. Add basil and 2 or 3 tablespoons of
  the oilve oil and pulse until a thick paste forms. Add half of the
  remaining oil and process for about 10 seconds until all basil is
  chopped fine but not pureed. Transfer pesto to a bowl and stir in the
  remaining olive oil.
  
  Assembly: Preheat oven and baking stone to 450F. When the dough is
  ready, punch it down and roll it out on a lightly floured surface to
  a thin disk about 16-18 inches in diameter. Fold the outer edge in
  about 1/2 an inch and pinch down to seal. Spread pesto evenly over
  crust. Space sun-dried tomatoes evenly across the crust, skin side
  up. Sprinkle pine nuts and roasted garlic slices evenly over pizza,
  then top with Fontina slices, spaced evenly. Sprinkle a little
  cornmeal on the baking stone. Carefully transfer the pizza to the
  baking stone and reduce heat to 400F. Bake until the crust is golden
  and the cheese is brown and bubbly, about 20 minutes. Let cool for a
  few minutes before slicing. Serves 4 as an entree.

           -Barb Day
     16 oz Cream cheese; softened
    3/4 c  Sugar
      2    Eggs
      1 tb Lemon juice
      1 ts Vanilla
     24    Vanilla wafers
     21 oz Cherry pie filling
 
   Beat cream cheese; sugar, eggs, lemon juice and vanilla until light

  vanilla wafer in the bottom of each. Fill each 2/3 full with the
  cream cheese mixture. Bake at 375 degrees 15 to 20 minutes, or until
  set. Top each with about 1 tablespoonful of the pie filling.
   I use different pie fillings, and sometimes more than one when
  making a recipe, they look very nice on frilly paper doilies, with
  the different colors of toppings. If you make marzipan, some green
  marzipan leaves look pretty on top, and at times I have made some
  little chocolate doodle figures to use with these. Barb Day

      7 tb Unsalted butter
    2/3 c  Granulated sugar

  Source:Dessert Sensations Fresh from France by Faye Levy
  
  These cookies are very quick and easy to make. They are shaped by
  pushing the batter from a spoon, like many American cookies, but then
  are flattened by tapping the baking sheet vigorously several times on
  the work surface so that they will be crisp.
  
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
  
  Lightly butter two (2) baking sheets.
  
  Beat butter until soft and smooth. Add sugar and beat until smooth.
  Add 1 egg and beat until blended. Beat second egg in a small bowl,
  then gradually beat it into mixture. Stir in lemon zest. Sift flour
  over mixture and stir it in with a wooden spoon. Let batter stand 15
  minutes at room temperature.
  
  To shape cookies, take 1/2 teaspoon of batter and use another
  teaspoon to push batter onto baking sheet. Space cookies about
  3-inches apart. TAP baking sheet vigorously several times on work
  surface to flatten cookies.
  
  Bake 6-7 minutes, or until edges of cookies are brown and centers
  light beige. Transer to a rack to cool. (If cookies harden and become
  difficult to remove, return them to oven for 30 seconds to soften.)
  Cool baking sheets and bake remaining cookies.
  
  Cookies can be kept about 1 week in an airtight container; or they
  can be frozen.

 Categories: Pastry, French
      Yield: 40 Fritters
 
      6 tb Butter
      2 ts Sugar
      1 pn Salt
      1 ts Grated lemon rind
      4    Eggs
      1 c  Flour
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 ts Rum, dark; opt
           Oil; for deep-frying
           Sugar, confectioners
 
  Combine the butter, sugar, salt, and lemon rind with 1 cup water in a
  saucepan and bring the mixture slowly to a boil. When the butter has
  completely melted, remove the pan from the heat. While the pan is
  heating, break each of the eggs into a separate custard cup or
  similar small dish and have these ready. When the pan is removed from
  the heat, add all the flour at once, stirring, first carefully, then,
  when the flour is absorbed, vigorously with a wooden spoon.
  
  When you have a compact, thick paste, turn the heat to medium high and
  return the pan to it.  Cook this mixture for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring
  constantly and scraping the sides and bottom, until the batter clings
  together in a solid mass, leaving the bottom and sides of the pan
  clean, and takes on a glossy look.  Turn off the heat and remove the
  pan from the stove.
  
  Beat in the vanilla, and the rum if used, giving the batter a chance
  to cool a little.  When it has, make a well in its center, pour in 1
  egg, and beat this into the mass. When it is incorporated, beat in
  another egg and proceed until all the eggs are used.  The resulting
  pastry should be flexible and soft, firm enough to hold its shape and
  not at all runny. Set it aside and let it rest for about 45 minutes,
  or for the duration of supper.
  
  When ready to make the fritters, fill a deep skillet or deep-fat fryer
  two-thirds full of oil and heat to 360 deg.F (not too hot, or the
  exteriors will brown before the center is cooked). If you are using a
  deep-fat fryer, do not use the basket, but a slotted spoon or wire
  mesh skimmer instead. Drop the batter into the hot oil a teaspoonful
  at a time, dipping the spoon into the oil after each scoop.  Don't
  overcrowd the pan, since they puff up to about four times their
  original size. Nudge them to roll over, so that they color evenly on
  all sides. When golden brown, drain on paper towels and sprinkle with
  confectioners' sugar. Serve hot. Pet de Breton. This recipe makes 1
  large fart. Make the batter with the same ingredients the same way as
  explained above, including the 45- minute rest. Preheat oven to 375
  deg.F.  Pour the batter into a large greased pan (a 10-inch or so
  heavy cast-iron frying pan works well for this) and set in the oven.
  Bake for an hour.  Remove, sprinkle with confectioners' sugar, tear
  apart, and eat as soon as it's cool enough to handle.

  warming it slowly, best in microwave.Let it cool off. Mix the flour
  and baking Powder together in bowl, make a well in the middle and put
  in the egg and the spices and stir all together slowly adding the
  cold honeymixture too. The dough has to be thick but has to drop of a
  spoon slowly ,if to thick add a little bit more cold coffe. Grease a
  cookiesheet very good and with a wet spatula spread the dough out on
  it,about 1 cm thick. Heat oven to 350 gegress F and put the
  cookiesheet on the highest rack in the oven. Bake about 20 minutes.
  Make the glaze and immedietly glaze the dough when it it comes out of
  the oven, cool a little and cut into rectangles. Store in a tightly
  closed tin container so they stay soft. Those are the old,
  traditional German Lebkuchen and the stores just add fancier shapes
  and chocolate icings.The best is to expiriment a little.

 Categories: Cookies, German
      Yield: 42 Cookies
 
  2 1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Cloves
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ginger
    1/4 ts Cardamom
    1/4 ts Pepper, black
    1/4 ts Baking soda
      2    Egg
      1 c  Brown sugar, dark
    1/3 c  Walnuts; finely chopped
      3 c  Sugar
        ds Cream of tartar
      1 c  ;Water
      2    Egg white
 
  Sift flour with spices and soda. Set aside.  In large bowl, using an
  electric beater at high speed, beat eggs and brown sugar until light
  (about five minutes). At low speed, beat in flour mixture and nuts.
  Mix until well-combined.  Dough will be *sticky*.  With wet hands,
  pinch dough by tablespoonsful and roll into 1-inch balls. Place on
  lightly greased cookie sheets and bake at 375 degrees for 12 to 15
  minutes. Cool on wire rack.
  
  While the cookies are cooling, combine sugar with cream of tartar and
  water in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring
  until sugar dissolves. Boil without stirring for five minutes or
  until sugar forms a two-inch thread when dropped from the spoon (235
  degrees on the candy thermometer).
  
  Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, with mixer at medium speed, beat egg
  whites until stiff peaks form. Pour syrup into egg whites in a
  continuous stream, beating constantly. Beat together until mixture is
  slightly thickened.
  
  Drop the cooled cookies, a few at a time, into the glaze. With a
  fork, turn to coat completely. Lift out and place on a wire rack to
  dry or, preferably, roll in a shallow bowl of sifted confectioners'
  sugar for a final dusting of crunchy, snowlike frosting.  Store in a
  tighly covered container at least a week before using.

      1 x  Grated peel of 1 lemon
    1/2 c  Candied citron,fine chopped
    1/2 c  Unblanched almonds, ground

  Stir together flour, cinnamon, basking powder, nutmeg, allspice,
  cloves, salt, pepper and mace; set aside. In a large bowl beat eggs
  at medium speed of mixer until fluffy. Gradually beat in sugar.
  Continue beating 15 minutes longer or until thick and fluffy. Add
  flour mixture in thirds, adding lemon peel, citron, and almonds to
  last third and blending thoroughly after each addition. Turn half the
  dough out onto lightly floured surface. Roll out 1/2 inch thick. Cut
  with 1-inch round cutter (inside of doughnut cutter works well) and
  place 1 inch apart on greased cookie sheets.
    Reroll scraps. Let stand uncovered at room temperature overnight.
  When ready to bake, turn cookies over so moist side is up; put drop
  of brandy in center of each. Bake in preheated 300 degree F. oven 20
  minutes or until cookies "pop" and are baked through. (Break one in
  half; if not sticky, it's done.) Remove to racks to cool. Makes 90
  cookies. NOTE cookies improve with age. Store in tightly covered
  container. Add a piece of apple to container a few days before
  serving to soften them. Per cookie: 48 cal, 1 g pro, 9 g car, 1 g
  fat, 11 mg chol.
    A drop of brandy on the top before baking causes them to "pop,"
  giving them a characteristic topknot.

  At Christmas time for sugar and spice these pfeffernusse are extra
  nice: try them once and you'll be delighted
  
  And so will the guests whom you've invited.
  
  Here's how it's done by the German folks: add half of the sugar to the
  beaten yolks, combine the mixture with flour and spices
  
  But keep it away from ratses and mices.
  
  The rest of the sugar and egg whites you take, with fruits and nuts a
  blend you make. To ripen it now you store it away
  
  And bake 18 minutes, the very next day.
  
  Sugar while warm and you can be sure they'll tempt the taste of an
  epicure.FROM:    DOLORES MCCANN   (BSWN00A)

      Title: PFEFFERNUSSE COOKIES
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 180 Servings
 
      3 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 c  Citron or other candied
           -fruit or fruit peel,
           -chopped
      6 c  Cake flour
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Cloves
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
    1/2 ts Mace
      1 tb Cinnamon
    1/2 c  Chopped nuts
 
  Grated rind of 1 lemon
  
  Beat the eggs well.  Add sugar about two tablespoons at a time and
  beat thoroughly with each addition.
  
  Add lemon rind and juice, finely chopped citron, the dry ingredients
  which have been mixed and sifted together, and the finely chopped
  nuts.
  
  Chill at least one hour, roll out 1/2 inch thick and cut out with a
  Pfeffernusse cutter, a round cutter about 7/8 of an inch in diameter.
  ( If a Pfeffernusse cutter is not available, a narrow bottle top or
  round tin bouillon cube box will do very nicely. )
  
  Place Pfeffernusse on a cookie sheet and let stand overnight in a cool
  place to dry.  The next morning before baking invert each cookie and
  put a drop of fruit juice or brandy on the moist spot on the bottom
  of the cookie and bake upside down.  This tends to make the
  Pfeffernusse "pop."

      Title: PFITZAUF
 Categories: Muffins, German
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    250 g  Flour (2 cups plus 3 1/2
           -Tbsp)
    1/2 l  Milk (2 cups plus 2 Tbsp)
      4    Eggs
           Salt
      2 tb Melted butter
      1 tb Sugar
 
  Combine the flour, milk, eggs, salt, and - if desired ~ a little
  sugar, and stir into a dough.  Then mix in the melted butter. Grease
  a 'Pfitzauf' pan* and fill halfway up with the dough. Bake in a hot
  oven for 25 minutes until light brown, WITHOUT ever opening the oven
  door to check! The 'Pfitzauf' gets dusted with sugar and is served
  with stewed fruit.
  
  ((*Note:  I have another recipe for 'Pfitzauf' which suggests one may
  substitute a muffin pan lined with paper cupcake holders. The same
  recipe specifies 400 degrees F. K.B.))
  
  Serves 4.

  When oil if very hot drop in garlic and toss until golden, about 30
  seconds. Add shrimp and toss until they turn pink, for beef or pork
  until light brown, no more that 1 min. for shrimp. Remove from pan
  and set aside. Add the egg to pan and tilt the pan to spread it into
  a thin sheet. As soon as it begins to set, scramble it to break it
  into small lumps. Remove and set aside with shrimp. Heat 1 tbs of oil
  in wok or skillet and heat 30 seconds and add soften noodles. Thin
  noodles to cover the surface of the pan, then clump them together and
  gently turn over. repeat this process until the noodles soften and
  curl into ivory ringlets. Add fish sauce and turn noodles to evenly
  season. Add sugar and peanuts and continue to turn the noodles to
  season. Reserve some of the bean sprouts, green onion for garnish.
  Add the bean sprouts, green onions and the shrimp and egg mixture.
  Cook for 1 minute, turning often. Transfer noodles to the serving
  paltter and squeeze the juice of 2 lime wedges over the top. Garnish
  with remaining beansprouts and lime and serve at once. Serves 1 very

  NOTES:
  
  *  HOMME Pheasant for Thanksgiving -- A couple of years ago, we
  decided that pheasant would be the perfect Thanksgiving meal for two.
  My husband conflated the best parts of all the pheasant recipes we
  could find (most came from the Gourmet cookbook) and came up with a
  recipe that I find wonderful.  It's moist and tender; tastes like
  chicken gone to heaven. (One of pheasant's main problems, by the way,
  is that it tends to be dry.)
  
  *  (We usually stick the whole cloves into the tangerine, insert all
  the other spices into the body cavity, then add the tangerine.)
  
  *  Some of these ingredients may be hard to find; feel free to omit
  them. "Mushroom peelings" are simply mushroom stems and leftovers,
  chopped fine. "Bruised peppercorns" are peppercorns that have been
  hit with a wooden mallet. Bon appetit, and good luck!

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    2 1/2-lb farm-raised
           -ready-to-roast pheasants
      2 md Navel oranges
      1 lg Carrot, quartered

      2 tb Butter or margarine
  2 1/2 c  Water
           Wild and brown rice mix
           -(opt.)
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Red-wine vinegar
    1/4 c  Dry red wine
      2 tb Cornstarch
    3/4 ts Salt
 
  1. Heat oven to 375'F. Rinse pheasants and pat dry. Remove any excess
  fat from body and neck cavities. Reserve necks and giblets. Loosen
  skin from the breast meat of each pheasant with your fingers, With
  knife, cut peel or rind and all membrane off 1 orange; cut peeled
  orange crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Reserve peel.
  
  2. Place half of the orange slices on breast meat under the skin of
  each bird. Tuck wing tips under back to hold neck skin down. Place 1
  carrot quarter, 1 onion quarter, and half of the orange peel inside
  each body cavity. Using kitchen string, tie the legs of each pheasant
  together.
  
  3. In 2-quart saucepan, melt butter; remove from heat. Place
  pheasants, breast sides up, on rack in a large roasting pan. Brush
  birds all over with melted butter. Set aside pan with any leftover
  butter.
  
  4. Roast the birds 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in saucepan with leftover
  butter, brown reserved necks and giblets. Add remaining onion and
  carrot quarters; saute 1 minute. Add water; heat to boiling.
  Partially cover pan; simmer giblet mixture over medium heat 45
  minutes or until liquid is reduced by almost a third.
  
  5. Brush birds with pan drippings. Turn each bird on its side; cover
  breasts with pieces of aluminum foil. Continue to roast birds 15
  minutes. Turn birds to roast on other side; roast 15 to 20 minutes
  longer orjust until juices run clear when thighs are pierced with a
  fork and breast meat near wing joint cut parallel to the bone is
  white with a touch of pink but no longer wet and soft.
  
  6. While pheasants are roasting, prepare rice following package direc-
  tions, if desired. Drain body-cavity juices from birds into roasting
  pan; cut string off birds. Transfer birds to a serving platter;
  surround with hot cooked rice blend; keep warm. Add giblet mixture to
  the roasting pan; heat and stir to loosen browned-on bits from the
  bottom of the pan. Strain mixture into a 4-cup measuring cup or bowl;
  discard particles. Spoon off fat from top of strained liquid. You
  should have 2 cups liquid; if not, add water or chicken broth.
  
  7. In 2-quart saucepan, heat sugar and vinegar to boiling, stirring
  often until sugar dissolves. Continue to boil sugar mixture or syrup
  until golden brown or it caramelizes 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from
  heat; set aside. In cup, combine wine and cornstarch; stir into syrup
  in sauce- pan. Whisk in strained 2 C liquid and salt; return to heat
  and boil, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens. Brush some sauce
  over birds; pour remainder into small pitcher.
  
  8. Peel and thinly slice remaining orange. Arrange over pheasant
  breasts. To carve, using sharp knife, remove the legs and thighs from
  the birds. Cut the drumsticks from the thighs. Thinly slice the
  breasts off the bone. Pass sauce with the meat.

      2 lb Pheasant hen, cleaned
           -(up to 2 1/2 lb)
      1    Onion, quartered
      1    Bay leaf
      6    Peppercorns
      1 sm Carrot, sliced
      1    Celery stalk, sliced
      1 ts Salt
      4 tb Butter
      1 pn Thyme, powdered
    1/4 ts Rosemary, dried
           -and crumbled
    1/4 c  Mushrooms, chopped
      2 tb Flour
      2 tb Black walnut meats,
           -finely chopped
 
  COOK BIRDS:  Split pheasant down the breastbone (or have your butcher
  do this).  Rinse the halves, place in a deep pot and barely cover
  with water. Add bay leaf, onion, carrot, celery, salt and peppercorns.
  
  Bring to rolling boil, then turn down heat and simmer for
  approximately 30 minutes, or until tender.  Remove foam and scum as
  it forms. Remove bird(s) from broth, reserving the broth.
  
  Using a heavy skillet, saute the halves in about 2 T of the butter
  until golden.  Place birds into small roasting pan or casserole with
  just enough water to cover the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle with thyme
  and rosemary. Bake, lightly covered with foil, for 30-40 minutes at
  350 degrees F.
  
  MAKE GRAVY:  While the birds are in the oven, strain the broth and
  boil rapidly down to about 2 cups.
  
  Brown the mushrooms using the same skillet in which you browned the
  pheasant. Remove the mushrooms and keep them warm.
  
  Melt the remaining 2 T  of butter in the skillet.  Add the flour,
  stirring up the browning from the pan. Cook over moderately high heat
  until golden brown. Blend in the broth using a wire whisk.
  
  Add mushrooms and continue cooking approximately 1-2 minutes. Turn
  down heat, cover and keep warm until pheasant is roasted.
  
  When the pheasants are cooked, remove them from the oven and scrape
  the herbs from the skin. After placing the pheasant halves on a warm
  platter (or leaving them in the casserole), pour the gravy over the
  pheasant. Garnish with the chopped nutmeats and serve. This dish is
  particularly good with wild rice.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pheasant in the North American tradition -- This recipe is adapted
  from the exceptionally good, controlled-circulation Recipes Only
  Magazine. The original dish was created by Mary Richard for use in
  her Teepee Restaurant, in Winnipeg. I found some of the ingredients
  hard to locate in a hurry and used what I had available with good
  results. You can substitute rock Cornish hen, guinea fowl, or chicken
  for the pheasant and hazelnuts, filberts or walnuts for the black
  walnuts.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy once you have the all the ingredients ready.
  : Time:  40 minutes preparation, 80 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  measure the spices.

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
           Bones from the pheasants
      4 tb Olive oil
  1 1/2 md Size unpeeled onions,
           -quartered
  1 1/2    Heads of garlic
           Two 750 milliliter bottles
           -Zinfandel
      3 qt Strong chicken stock
      6 oz Black olives (preferably
           -kalamata), pitted
      3    Roma tomatoes, peeled,
           -seeded, chopped
           Salt and pepper, to taste
 
  To remove breast meat and thighs from pheasants, cut down each side
  of the ridge of the breastbone with a boning knife. Scrape the knife
  down the side of the breast bone and the rib cage to remove meat from
  the bone. Leave wings attached. Slit the skin between the knee and
  top of the breast, then slip it around to the small of the back.
  Force the knee down, and soon you will see the ball joint where the
  leg-thigh meets the small of the back, Cut through the knee joint.
  Run tip of knife along both sides of remaining thigh bone and pull
  away from the meat. A boneless thigh portion, skin-on and rather
  square shaped, and a skin-on boneless breast with wing attached
  remain. Reserve bones for stock. Mix marinade ingredients and pour
  over pheasant. Marinate 2 to 3 hours. The sauce: Crack reserved bones
  with the blunt edge of a heavy knife. Heat the olive oil in a 5-quart
  stock pot until oil is smoking hot. Add bones and brown, stirring
  constantly. After 10 minutes bones should begin to take on a golden
  brown color. Keep stirring so ingredients don't burn. Add onions and
  garlic and cook approximately 10 minutes longer, until onions and
  garlic have caramelized, and the bones have browned. Spoon excess oil
  from pot, and add Zinfandel, stirring to dislodge browned bits from
  bottom of pot. Reduce heat to medium and cook until liquid reduces in
  volume and becomes syrupy. Add chicken stock, bring to a boil, and
  cook until sauce has reduced to 3 or 4 cups. Strain. Sauce should be
  thick enough to coat a spoon. When ready to serve, reheat sauce with
  the olives and tomatoes. Season to taste with pepper and salt. Lift
  pheasant from marinade and scrape off any solids clinging to the
  meat. Season with salt and pepper. Sear meat skin side down until
  golden. Turn and repeat. Roast pheasant in a 400 degrees F. oven for
  10 to 12 minutes. Breast meat will be finished first and should feel
  plump and tender to the touch. Thigh meat must be cooked through and
  will need a few more minutes to cook. Serve 1 breast and 1 thigh per
  person. Drizzle olive sauce over meat.

      Title: PHEASANT WITH CHAMPAGNE CABBAGE VI (ASSEMBLY)
 Categories: Game, Masterchefs, New york
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Pheasants **
           Pheasant Stock **
           Mousseline Stuffing **
           Pheasant Sauce **
           Champagne Cabbage **
      6 tb Butter, clarified **
 
       ** See recipes for Clarified Butter, Pheasant with Champagne
  Cabbage I (Stock), Pheasant with Champagne Cabbage II (Stuffing),
  Pheasant with Champagne Cabbage III (Sauce), Pheasant with Champagne
  Cabbage IV (Pheasant), and Pheasant with Champagne Cabbage V
  (Cabbage).
  
  To Assemble:
  
       Place the leg-thigh portions of the Pheasants, skin side down and
  short ends toward yourself between 2 sheets of plastic wrap; flatten
  gently with a mallet or side of a cleaver.
  
       Spread about 1/3 cup of stuffing on each portion and fold meat
  over to form a 1/2-inch border on each of the 2 long sides.
  
       Starting with a short side, roll the stuffing and meat into a
  neat cylinder.  Use kitchen twine to tie compactly, wrapping twine
  around once lengthwise and 3 times crosswise.  Chill, covered, until
  firm (at least 30 minutes.)
  
       Preheat oven to 450 F.
  
       Heat 6 tablespoons of clarified butter in a large oven-proof
  skillet.
  
       Salt and pepper the stuffed leg packages and saute, shaking pan
  occasionally, until golden on all sides (about 4 minutes.) Place
  skillet in oven and roast for 4 minutes.
  
       Return skillet to the top of stove over medium-high heat.  Add
  breast halves to the pan, skin side up, and sprinkle with salt and
  pepper. Saute for 2 minutes, shaking pan occasionally.
  
       Turn breasts skin side down, sprinkle with salt and pepper and
  return to the oven until everything is tender (about 7 minutes.)
  
       Transfer meat to work surface.  Cut leg-thigh portions crosswise
  into 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Thinly slice breasts lengthwise on a
  diagonal.
  
  To Serve:
  
       Mound about 1/2 cup of cabbage in the center of each of 4 warmed
  serving plates.  Place leg-thigh slices around bottom of each plate,
  overlapping slightly.  Place breast slices in a fan pattern at top of
  each plate, overlapping slightly.  Spoon some sauce around the meat
  and cabbage; serve the rest of the sauce separately.

      Title: PHILADELPHIA CHEESESTEAK SANDWICHES
 Categories: Sandwiches, Beef, Cheese
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
      2.5 lb sliced beef
  :          (Steak-ums are okay,
  :          but some delis will sell
  :          it fresh)
        1 md lg onion, sliced
        1    green or red pepper,
  :          sliced
        4 sm cherry hot peppers,
  :          sliced
        4 sm sweet peppers, sliced
        8 sl Provolone cheese
        4    Italian Rolls
  
  The key to authentic Philly cheesesteaks is the bread. If you can
  find a good Italian bakery to give you good Italian bread, you're
  almost all the way there. For best results, use a griddle that covers
  two stove burners, or an electric griddle of similar size. Also, two
  identical griddle spatulas will make things easier.
  
  Preheat the griddle (or light both burners).
  
  On one side of the griddle, heat all the beef, chopping the beef
  finely until all the slices (or sheets, or whatever) have formed a
  large pile of small bits. Keep the beef moving as you cook the onion,
  followed by the peppers, on the other side of the griddle. When
  everything is fully cooked, combine everything and mix thoroughly,
  finally dividing the mixture into 4 columns on the griddle, keeping
  each column as separate as possible. Cover the columns with two
  slices each of provolone, mist with water to melt the cheese, and
  cover, if possible.  When cheese has melted, cover the column with
  the Italian Roll, which will give you a completed, but upside-down,
  sandwich. Just scoop them up with the spatula. Walt MM Larry Miller

  place with cut edges up on pan, about 1/2" apart. Lots of
  cinnamon-sugar will fall out when you cut the buns. Sprinkle this on
  top of the pieces in the pan. * As oven heats to 400 degrees, allow
  dough to stand 15 minutes. * Bake 25 minutes. Remove from pan at
  once, turning upside down to serve.  Buns will expand to form a large
  cake. There will be about a dozen buns. Pull apart to eat.

      1 ea Veal knuckle
      1 ea Pot herbs, bunch
      4 ea Med Potato
      1 ea Onion, large

      2 c  Flour
      1 x  Water
      1 x  Salt
      1 x  Parsley, chopped
 
  Cook the tripe the day before using. Wash thoroughly, place in kettle
  and cover with water. Boil 8 hours. Remove the tripe. When cooled,
  cut into pieces about 1/2 inch square. The next day wash the veal
  knuckle, cover with 3 quarts of cold water and simmer about 3 hours,
  removing scum as it rises. Remove meat from bones and cut into small
  pieces. Strain the broth and return to kettle. Add the bay leaf and
  onion and simmer about 1 hour. Then add the potatoes, which have been
  cut in squares, and the pot herbs. Add the meat and tripe and season
  with salt and cayenne pepper (if desired). Make dumplings by
  combining the finely chopped suet, flour, salt and enough water to
  permit rolling the dough into dumplings, about the size of marbles.
  Flour well to prevent sticking and drop into the hot soup. Cook 10
  minutes, add some chopped parsley and serve at once. Source:

      1    Medium bay leaf
      2 ts Salt
      2 c  Water
      1    Small green cabbage
    1/4 lb Slab bacon, trimmed of rind

      1 c  Finely diced celery
      2 tb Soy sauce
           Oil for deep frying

MMMMM----------------------LUMPIA WRAPPERS---------------------------
      2 c  All purpose flour
      2 c  Cold water
           Vegetable oil
 
    Combine the chicken, pork, quartered onion, celery tops, bay leaf
  and 1 teaspoon salt in a heavy 3-4 quart saucepan. Pour in the water
  and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover tightly
  and simmer 20-30 minutes, or until chicken and pork are almost tender
  and show only slight resistance when pierced with the point of a
  small sharp knife.
    Remove chicken and pork, and when cool enough to handle, bone and
  skin the chicken and cut the meat and pork into 1/4" dice. Strain the
  broth and reserve it.
    Remove and discard the tough outer leaves of the cabbage, cut the
  cabbage into quarters. Cut out the cores and slice the quarters
  crosswise into 1/4" wide strips.
    In a heavy 12" skillet, cook the bacon over moderate heat, stirring
  frequently until it is crisp and has rendered all its fat. With a
  slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain.
    Cook sliced onion and garlic in the bacon fat for about 5 minutes
  until the onion is soft and transparent but not brown. Add pork and
  chicken and stir 1-2 minutes, until the meat browns slightly. Add
  each vegetable in the following order: green beans, bean sprouts,
  celery and cabbage. Add the bacon bits, 1/2 the reserved broth,
  remaining salt and the soy sauce, turning constantly with a spoon,
  cook over medium heat 3 minutes longer. Transfer contents of the
  skillet to a colander and drain 10-15 minutes. Discard the liquid.
  (Filling will keep at room temp. 2-3 hours).
    Assembly: shape about 1/3 cup of filling into a cylinder about 5"
  long and 1" diameter, place in the center of a wrapper, leave about 1
  1/2" of the wrapper exposed at each side. Roll the wraapper around
  the filling, tucking the ends inside as you roll.
    Heat oil in a deep fat fryer to about 375 deg F, and fry each lumpia
  about 2 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crisp. Drain on
  paper towels and serve immediately, or keep hot and serve.
    Wrappers: Combine flour and water and mix until it forms a smooth
  paste, the consistency of a heavy cream. Set a heavy 8" skillet over
  moderate heat for about 30 seconds. Dip a pastry brush in the oil and
  spread a light film over the bottom and sides of the skillet. Then
  immerse the tip of a 2" wide paintbrush into the batter, and with 5-6
  overlapping strokes, cover the bottom of the skillet. Cook for a few
  seconds until it begins to curl away from the sides of the skillet.
  Lift the wrapper and transfer to a strip of lightly floured waxed
  paper. May be kept at room temp. no more that 2 hours.

  1 1/4 c  Warm water
      3    - 4 c flour
      2 ts Salt
           Kosher or margarita salt
 
  Dissolve yeast thoroughly in 1/4 cup warm water.  Mix 3 cups flour
  and salt in large bowl.  Add yeast with remaining 1 cup water. Add
  enough additional flour to make dough stiff. Knead 10 minutes or till
  dough feels elastic. Form into ball.  Place in bowl and spread with
  butter. Cover with towel and let rise till doubled, about 45 minutes.
  Divide dough into 12 small balls and roll between hands (or on
  counter) to form a rope. Form into pretzel shapes, wetting and
  pinching ends firmly. Dissolve baking soda in 4 cups water and bring
  to a boil. Drop pretzels, a few at a time, in water and boil till
  they float to the top, about 1 minute. Remove and drain. Place on
  buttered baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and bake at 475 for 15-20
  minutes or till golden brown. Place on rack to cool. I used to make
  these a lot when my husband had to do field time in the army.
  According to all the guys, they warm up pretty good and are excellent
  with some German scharfer senf (sharp/hot mustard).

 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 48 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Flour, all purpose
      1 lb Butter, soft
      1 c  Fruit sugar
      1 c  Sifted rice flour
    1/2 lb Belgian chocolate
 
  Spread the all-purpose flour on a cookie sheet and place under a
  pre-heated broiler about 4-5 inches from the element. Roast the
  flour, watching it all the time until it is medium brown. Turn the
  flour with a spatula to brown the other side.  The entire procedure
  takes about three minutes and gives the flour a rich nutty flavour.
  Let the flour cool.
  Mix the soft butter with the fruit sugar and add the sifted rice
  flour. Fold in the roasted flour and blend well.  Chop the chocolate
  into chunks just a little smaller than a sugar cube. Mix them into
  the dough, taking care you don't soften the chocolate too much. Shape
  as desired. Bake at 300F for 1 hour.  Cool, then store in an airtight
  container. Yield depends upon size and shape.

  sticks, we have been known to use Japanese udon before the real thing
  was widely available (precooked) Very thin sliced beef Garnish:
  chopped green onions (include green part) chopped fresh mint Cilantro
  sliced lemons (they used to slice by cutting through "equator"
  putting flat surface down on cutting board, and making a series of
  parallel vertical cuts. This way doesn't squirt in your eyes!)
  Original method: put noodles in bowl, top with single layer of sliced
  beef, pour on boiling broth which cooks beef, garnish to taste, add
  fresh cayenne pepper (ot), black pepper, and nuoc mam to taste, eat.
  (soupspoon in left hand for broth, chopsticks in right) Americanized:
  put a small serving of sliced beef in a ladle, dip in boiling broth
  to cook beef, pour cooked beef and broth onto noodles, garnish and
  eat. Substitute _small_ quantities of soy sauce for nuoc mam. The
  broth is not supposed to be dark brown! Pho

      1 ea Lime, quartered

MMMMM--------------------------EXTRA'S-------------------------------
      1 ea Hoisin sauce
      1 ea Asian chili sauce
 
  Use Rice sticks or cellophane noodles. Partially freeze beef before
  cutting. Cook's notes: Star anise, fish sauce, hoisin sauce and Asian
  chili sauce are available at Asian markets or some supermarkets with
  large Asian specialty sections. Use caution when working with fresh
  chilies. Upon completion of slicing, wash work surface and hands
  thoroughly; do not touch your eyes. Procedure: Combine the beef
  stock, ginger, star anise, green onions and fish sauce and gently
  simmer for 30 minutes. Remove the ginger, anise and green onions.
  Soak the rice sticks in warm water for 30 minutes. Slice the green
  onions, onion and basil leaves as thinly as possible. Slice the beef
  as thinly as possible across the grain. It helps to partially freeze
  the meat before slicing.  Bring 4 quarts water to a boil. Arrange the
  bean sprouts, mint sprigs, chilies and lime on a platter. Just before
  serving, bring the broth to a boil. Cook the rice sticks in boiling
  water for 30 seconds, then drain. Presentation: Divide the noodles
  among 4 large bowls. Arrange the scallions, onion slices and beef
  slices on top. Spoon the boiling broth on top: The heat of the liquid
  should be sufficient to cook the meat. Serve the soup at once, with
  the garnish platter on the side. Let each person add sprouts, mint,
  chilies, lime, hoisin sauce and/or chili sauce to taste. Yield: Makes
  4 servings. Nutritional info (per serving): 206 calories, 5 grams

      2    Scallion; thinly sliced
      1 tb Coriander; shredded
      2 md Onion; sliced paper-thin
    1/4 c  Hot chili sauce (tuong ot)
           -or nuoc cham)
      1 lb Dried rice stick, 1/4" wide
    1/2 c  Nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish sa
           Pepper, black

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
      2 c  Fresh bean sprouts
      2    Fresh red chile peppers;
           -sliced
      2    Lime; cut into wedges
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 lg Garlic clove; flattened
 
      In order to cut the beef into paper-thin slices, freeze the
  pieces of meat for 30 minutes before slicing.
  
      The night before, clean the bones under cold running water and
  soak overnight in a pot with water to cover at room temperature.
  (This will help loosen the impurities inside the bones. When heat is
  applied, these impurities are released and come to the top much
  faster and can be removed, therefore, producing a clear broth.)
  
      Place the beef bones, oxtails and short rib plate in a large
  stockpot. Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Cook for 10
  minutes. Drain. Rinse the pot and the bones.
  
      Return the bones to the pot and add six quarts of water. Bring to
  a boil. Skim the surface to remove the foam and fat. Stir the bones
  in the bottom of the pot from time to time to free the impurities.
  Continue skimming until the foam ceases to rise. Add three quarts
  more water and bring to a boil. Skim off all the residue that forms
  on the top. Turn the heat to low and simmer.
  
      Meanwhile, char the clove-studded onions, shallots and ginger
  directly over a gas burner or under the broiler until they release
  their fragrant odors. Tie the charred vegetables, star anise and
  cinnamon stick in a double thickness of dampened cheesecloth. Add the
  spice bag, parsnips and salt to the simmer-ing broth. Simmer for one
  hour.
  
      Remove the short rib plates. Pull the meat away from the bones.
  Reserve the meat and return the bones to the pot. Simmer the broth,
  uncovered, for four to five hours. Keep an eye on it; as the liquid
  boils away, add enough fresh water to cover the bones.
  
      Meanwhile, slice the beef sirloin against the grain into paper-
  thin slices, roughly two by two inches in size. Slice the reserved
  short rib meat paper-thin. Set aside.
  
      In a small bowl, combine the scallions, coriander and half of the
  slice onions. Place the remaining sliced onions in a small bowl and
  stir in the hot chili sauce. Blend well.
  
      Soak the rice sticks in warm water for 30 minutes. Drain and set
  aside.
  
      When the broth is ready, remove and discard all of the bones.
  Strain the broth through a strainer or colander lined with a double
  layer of dampened cheesecloth into a clean pot. Add the fish sauce
  and bring the broth to a boil. Reduce the heat and keep the broth at
  a bare simmer.
  
      In another pot, bring four quarts of water to a boil. Drain the
  noodles, then drop them in the boiling water. Drain immediately.
  Divide the noodles among four large soup bowls. Top the noodles with
  the sliced meats. bring the broth to a rolling boil. Ladle the broth
  directly over the meat in each bowl (the boiling broth will cook the
  raw beef instantly). Garnish with the scallion mixture and freshly
  ground black pepper.
  
      Serve the onions in hot chili sauce and the accompaniments on the
  side. Each diner will add these ingredients as desired.

      Title: PHOENIX-TAILED SHRIMP
 Categories: Seafood, Ethnic
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb (medium) fresh shrimp
      1 tb Vodka
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/8 ts White pepper
      1 c  All-purpose flour
      2 ts Baking powder
      1 c  Water, cold
      2 c  Oil, for deep-frying
      6 tb Salt, coarse
    1/2 ts Black peppercorns
      2 tb Szechuan  peppercorns
 
  Carefully remove the shells from the shrimp, leaving the tail sections
  intact. Devein and wash under cold running water; pat dry with paper
  towels.  In a dish or bowl, marinate briefly in a mixture of the
  vodka, salt, and pepper while you make the batter.
  
  In a mixing, put the flour and baking powder; gradually add the cold
  water, whisking until smooth.
  
  In a wok, heat the 2 cup of oil until it reaches 350 degrees F. Add 1
  tablespoon of the hot oil to the batter and stir to combine. Take a
  shrimp by the tail and dip it into the batter (do not dip the tail),
  then slide it into the hot oil. Deep-fry all the shrimp, a few at a
  time, until golden brown. This should take about 2 minutes for each
  batch. Drain on paper towels, and serve tails up, in a serving dish,
  with the salt/pepper mixture for dipping. Makes 8 to 10 appetizer
  servings.
  
  FOR DIPPING:  In a bowl, combine coarse salt and the peppercorns. In
  a dry frying pan over high heat, brown the salt/pepper mixture. When
  browned remove and run the mixture through a grinder.

           -phyllo sheets
           -juice
           -fresh fruit
 
  A nice, easy, use for oil-less phyllo is as fancy nests in which to
  serve poached fruit. I cut (or tear) a sheet in 2 or 3 strips, drape
  them in an oven-proof bowl, and bake (at about 400 F, check the box)
  until they are lightly toasted with a few darker places. Poach some
  fruit (whole pears and apples are nice) in juice && serve in the
  phyllo nest w/ a bit of the poaching syrup dribbled over the top
  (maybe add a few whole berries to decorate). Assemble them at serving
  time so the phyllo will not get soggy.

      Title: PHYLLO PIES
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea Fruit, drained - I used
           Pineapple, cherries, and
           Strawberries
      1 ea Phyllo dough
      1 ea Pam or other spray oil
           (regular oil in a pump spray
           Bottle would be cheaper and
           Equally effective)
      1 ea Flour and sugar, 50-50
           Mixture, about 1/2c per cup
           To cup and a half of fruit.
 
  Any fruit would work fine, I think.  Take the fruit and thaw if
  frozen and drain.  Mix the flour/sugar mixture into the fruit. The
  flour thickens the remaining juices of the fruit so it hopefully
  won't make the pastry soggy, and sugar for sweetness (this amount of
  sugar is to MY taste, vary to adjust for desired flavor).
  
  Take a few sheets of the phyllo dough and roll the rest back up. The
  phyllo dries out very quickly. Fold each sheet of dough into fourths
  (fold in half and then in half in the other direction), put a
  spoonful of fruit in the middle of the dough, and fold the dough over
  the fruit into a neat little package. Put the package onto a cookie
  sheet sprayed with Pam. When the cookie sheet is full, spray the tops
  of all the packages with Pam to keep it from burning.
  
  Bake in a 325 F oven for about 20 min - until a light golden brown
  color on top.
  
  Source: A while back someone suggested putting a slice of pineapple
  in a folded sheet of phyllo dough. I took their recipe and modified
  it a little.

      3 c  Mixed berries, raspberries,
           Blackberries, blueberries
           Strawberries; sliced
      2 tb Icing sugar
     12    Mint sprigs; optional
 
  *Store bought Creme Fraiche can be used *homemade Raspberry Coulis
  can be used
  
  CREME FRAICHE : In a small bowl, stir 1 1/2 cups whipping cream with
  1/3 c granulated sugar, yogurt and lemon juice until blended and most
  of the sugar is dissolved. Cover loosely with cheesecloth or kitchen
  cloth. Let stand at room temperature until thickened, about 24 hours.
  Then line a sieve with a double layer of cheesecloth or a thin
  kitchen cloth. Place the sieve over a bowl and pour the thickened
  creme fraiche into the sieve. Refrigerate the bowl with the liquid
  until the liquid is drained off and the creme fraiche is as thick as
  ricotta cheese, about 2 hours. Discard the drained liquid. Remove the
  thickened creme fraiche from the cheesecloth and place it in a bowl.
  Refrigerate until ready to use. PHYLLO SHELLS: Preheat the oven to
  350F. To prepare the phyllo tarts, melt the butter over low heat. Lay
  the 4 sheets of phyllo on the counter. Cover the entire surface of
  the phyllo sheets with wax paper and a damp kitchen cloth to prevent
  them from drying out and cracking.
     Place 1 sheet of phyllo on the counter and brush it with melted
  butter. Carefully lay another sheet of phyllo over the first so that
  the corners match perfectly. Brush with more butter. Cover with
  remaining two sheets of phyllo, brushing each with melted butter.
    Cut the phyllo into 12 4 X 3 inch rectangles. Lightly butter 12
  large muffin or tart tins, approximately 3 inches wide. Carefully
  place the phyllo rectangles into the muffin cups, pressing them into
  the bottom to form a tart shell. Keep the edges of the phyllo
  upright, do not fold them over. Prick the bottom of the shells with a
  fork.
    Bake for 8 to 10 minutes until the edges are crisp and brown.
  Immediately remove the phyllo sheets from the muffin tins and cool
  them on a rack. The shells can made up to a day before serving. Store
  them in an airtight container at room temperature. Do not
  refrigerate. FILLING: In a small mixing bowl, using an electric
  mixer, beat 1/2 cup whipping cream with 2 Tbsp granulated sugar and
  vanilla until soft peaks form when the beaters are lifted. Fold in
  the Creme Fraiche just until blended. Refrigerate until ready to use.
  RASPBERRY COULIS: Place raspberries and lemon juice in a blender or
  processor. Whirl (using on -off motion) until smooth. Strain the
  remove the seeds. (Taste and add sugar if needed). Refrigerate if not
  using right away. ASSEMBLY: Just before serving, spoon 2 heaping
  teaspoonfuls of creme fraiche filling into each phyllo shell. Arrange
  a mixture of berries on top. Sprinkle with icing sugar. Spoon 3 Tbsp
  Raspberry Coulis onto each plate. Place the filled phyllo tarts on
  top of Raspberry Coulis and garnish with mint if desired. Serve
  immediately. MAKES: 12 TARTS

      1 pn Cayenne pepper
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1 lb Phyllo
      1 lb Unsalted butter
 
  Number of Servings:  50
  
  Remove all the meat from the lobster and chop.  Set aside. Melt 2
  tablespoons butter in a small skillet, and saute the green onions for
  2 or 3 minutes. Add the lobster meat and wine or vodka, and stir
  quickly to combine over high heat.  Drain the mixture, reserving the
  liquid. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in another skillet.
  Add the flour and cook slowly without coloring the flour for 5
  minutes. Add the reserved liquid and the cream, and stir constantly
  until the mixture begins to thicken. Stir lobster meat back into
  mixture, add cayenne pepper and season to taste.  Cool mixture before
  filling phyllo. To assemble the triangles, melt and cool the pound of
  butter. Place one sheet of phyllo on a flat surface and brush lightly
  with butter. Top this with two more sheets, buttering each.  Cut the
  sheets in half lengthwise, then cut each half crosswise into 6 equal
  parts. Spoon a teaspoon of filling onto the end of each strip and
  form a triangle by folding the righthand corner to the opposite side,
  as you would a flag.  Continue folding until the entire strip is
  used. Preheat oven to 400F. Place triangles on a buttered baking
  sheet. Brush the tops of each with melted butter and bake until
  golden brown, about 10 minutes.
  
  NOTE:  Filled phyllo triangles can be kept in the refrigerator,
  unbaked, for 2 days, or frozen immediately for future use.

      Title: PHYLLO~ EATING WELL'S LOW-FAT METHOD
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  For appetizers with a lot of style but little fat, phyllo pastries
  are a natural. The paper-thin sheets of phyllo dough can be rolled,
  folded, shaped, seasoned, or filled in countless ways. In typical
  phyllo recipes, however, the layers of dough are freely brushed with
  melted butter; when baked, the butter keeps the thin sheets separate,
  producing a flaky--and fat-saturated--result. We developed a
  technique in which the leaves of phyllo are lightly coated with a
  blend of egg white and olive oil. During baking, the egg whites
  become crisp while the oil keeps the leaves separate. The low-fat
  technique has an unexpected and welcome benefit: the pastries turn
  out crisper and less oily than those made with pure fat, and filled
  pastires don't become soggy.
  
  Frozen phyllo (or filo or fillo) is available in most supermarkets;
  it is also sold fresh in some Greek and Middle Eastern specialty
  shops. One pound of dough averages 25 large sheets of pastry. Our
  recipes were devloped for full-sized sheets, either 14 by 18 inches
  or 12 by 17 inches. These appetizers work beautifully for
  entertaining because they can be prepared in advance and refrigerated
  or frozen.
  
  TIPS:
  
  Phyllo Dough is easy and fun to work with as long as it doesn't get
  soggy or dried out. To avoid these potential hazards:
  
     Thaw frozen phyllo in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours or
  overnight; this will prevent damp spots that could cause the sheets of
  dough to stick together.
  
     Remove phyllo from refrigerator, and leave unopened at room
  temperature for 1 to 2 hours.
  
     Clear a large work surface before removing phyllo from the box.
  
     Carefully unroll sheets onto a dry surface.
  
     Keep sheets of phyllo covered with plastic wrap or wax paper while
  you work; if the dough is left uncovered for even a short period of
  time, it dries out and breaks into flakes.
  
     Work quickly and with a gentle hand.

      Title: PIADINI
 Categories: Italian, Breads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      3 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Baking powder
      3 tb Oliye oil
    1/2 c  (generous) mixture of half
           -milk, half water
 
  I'm not much of a baker, but these recipes for an Italian bread and
  sauteed greens to stuff in it sounded good...
  
  Mix flour, salt and baking powder in a large bowl. Make a well in the
  center and pour in the olive oil and a little of the milk-water
  mixture. Start to mix the dough with a fork, gradually adding the
  rest of the liquid; you probably will need extra water, depending on
  the absorbency of the flour.
  
  When the dough has come together and leaves the sides of the bowl
  clean, form it into a rough ball and put it on a very lightly floured
  surface. Knead until it is smooth, about 10 minutes. Let rest for 10
  to 30 minutes, at your convenience.
  
  When the dough has rested divide it into small balls, each about the
  size of a plum.  Roll each ball out into a flat circle about 1/8-inch
  thick. Now put the heavy pan or bakestone on medium heat. Let the pan
  become hot enough to make a drop of water dance.
  
  Put the first piadina in the pan and press down with a wooden
  spatula. Let cook on one side for 20 seconds or so++when you lift it
  to turn it over it should have whitened, and there will be the faint
  beginnings of small brown scorch marks.  Repeat with the second side
  and turn the bread 2 or 3, times during cooking.
  
  When the bread is ready it will have puffed up like a pocket bread and
  should have small brown spots over its surface; as soon as you have
  achieved this effect, put the cooked piadina on a wire cake rack and
  proceed with the next one.
  
  Serve hot, with slices of prosciutto, salami or cheese, and perhaps
  olives, radishes or a little tomato for a quick lunch.
  
  Makes 10 to 12 breads.

      2 lb Ground beef, lean

      1    Garlic clove,
           -finely chopped
      3 md Tomatoes, peeled

    1/2 c  Almonds, slivered
      1    Jalapeno chili, seeded

           -to taste)
    1/2 c  Raisins (soaked 10

    1/2 c  Pimento-stuffed olives,
           -halved crosswise
    1/2 ts Oregano
    1/2 ts Thyme
           Salt
           Pepper
      1 tb Butter
 
  Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet.  Add the beef and saute until
  it is lightly browned, stirring to break up any lumps. Add the onion
  and garlic and saute for 5 minutes longer. Add all the remaining
  ingredients except the butter and the almonds. Mix well and simmer,
  uncovered, over moderate heat, stirring from time to time, for 20
  minutes.
  
  In a small skillet, heat the butter and saute the almonds until they
  are golden brown.
  
  Mound the beef onto a serving platter and sprinkle with the almonds.
  Surround it with a border of rice.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Latin-American seasoned chopped beef -- I got this recipe from
  net.cooks in the fall of 1983. It was posted by houxm!houxz!llf.
  
  *  Picadillo is a great favorite throughout Latin America, and every
  country has its own version. In Mexico it is much appreciated as a
  filling for tacos, empanadas, tamales and green peppers. In the north
  of the country it is popular on its own and is eaten as a main dish,
  accompanied by rice, beans, guacamole and tortillas.
  
  *  Variations:  Instead of oregano and thyme, use a pinch or two of
  cinnamon and ground cloves. This makes an interesting difference in
  flavor, giving the dish an almost Middle Eastern taste.
  
  *  In Chihuahua, the apple is left out and 4 medium potatoes, cooked
  and cubed, and about 2 C cooked green peas are added to the beef at
  the end of the cooking time for just long enough to heat them
  through. This makes a nice one-dish meal.
  
  *  Picadillo de la Costa from the state of Guerrero, best known for
  the beach resort of Acapulco, uses the tropical fruits in which the
  region abounds, and instead of beef uses an equal mixture of ground
  pork and veal. The method is the same but the meats, with the onion,
  garlic, tomatoes, hot peppers, salt and pepper, are cooked,
  uncovered, for 15 minutes. Then add about 1 1/2 C pineapple chunks, 2
  pears (peeled, cored and cut in chunks) and 2 bananas (peeled and
  sliced) are added and the mixture simmered for 15 minutes longer over
  low heat. Sprinkle with almonds just before serving. This is a
  delicious summer dish, good with plain rice.
  
  *  In addition to the almonds, I add fresh coriander leaves as a
  garnish.

      1/4 c  finely chopped fresh
  :          coriander if desired
  :          Salt and pepper
  :          For the topping:
        2 lb sweet potatoes
        1 lb russet (baking) potatoes
        3 TB unsalted butter, plus 1
  :          tablespoon
  
  Make the filling: In a large heavy skillet cook the onion, garlic,
  jalapeno peppers, cumin, chili powder, and oregano in the oil over
  moderately high heat, stirring until the onion is soft. Add the chuck
  and cook it over moderately high heat, stirring and breaking up any
  lumps, until it is no longer pink. Add the tomato paste, the tomatoes
  with the juice, the raisins, olives, corn, coriander, salt and black
  pepper to taste. Simmer the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 10 to
  15 minutes, or until it is thickened. The filling may be made up to 1
  day in advance, kept covered and chilled, and brought to room
  temperature before proceeding.
  
  Make the topping: In a large saucepan combine the sweet and russet
  potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces, with enough cold water to
  cover them by 1 inch. Bring the water to a boil and simmer the
  potatoes for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they are tender. Drain the
  potatoes, return them to the pan, and cook them over moderate heat,
  shaking the pan, for 30 seconds to evaporate any excess liquid. Force
  the potatoes through a ricer or the medium disk of a food mill into a
  bowl. Add the butter and salt and pepper to taste, and stir the
  mixture until it is combined well and the butter is melted.
  
  Transfer the filling to a 3-quart baking dish at least 2 1/2 inches
  deep, spoon the topping over it, spreading it to cover the filling
  completely, and dot the top with the butter, cut into bits. Bake the
  pie in the middle of a preheated 400 degree F oven for 35 to 40
  minutes, or until it is browned lightly.

  until tender, 20 minutes, and omit the vegetable oil.) Add the
  potato, raisins, and olives to the meat, correct the seasonings, and
  continue cooking until most of the liquid is absorbed, 10 to 15
  minutes. 4. Transfer the picadillo to a large bowl or platter, place
  the chopped egg in the center, outline the border with peas, and
  sprinkle the entire dish with the pimiento. Makes 4 to 6 servings

  minutes, or until most of the liquid is absorbed. If the liquid is
  not absorbed sufficiently at the end of 30 minutes, cook uncovered

 Categories: Breads, Italian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  2 1/2 ts Active dry yeast
    1/2 c  Warm water
  1 1/4 c  Biga
      2 tb Lard
      2 tb Sliced mushrooms
      1 tb Olive oil
      3 tb Canned tomatoes with juices
      1 sm Anchovy fillets; boned and c
      1 tb Capers; drained and chopped
      6 sm Cocktail onions; chopped
      2 tb Artichokes; finely chopped
      3    Gherkins; chopped
      2    Roasted red peppers; chopped
      1 tb Dried oregano
  2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour; unbleache
      1 ts Salt
    3/4 ts Cracked black pepper
 
  Recipe by: Carol Field - The Italian Baker Refrigerate the Biga until
  cold. stir the yeast into the water in a small bowl; let stand until
  creamy, about 10 minutes. Saute the mushrooms briefly in the oil and
  let cool. Roughly chop the tomato, mushrooms, anchovy, capers,
  onions, artichoke, pickles, and red peppers in a food processor
  fitted with the steel blade. Remove to another bowl. Process the
  oregano, flour, salt, and pepper with 5 or 6 pulses to mix. Place the
  cold starter and the lard over the dry ingredients.  With the machine
  running pour the dissolved yeast through the feed tube as quickly as
  the flour can absorb it. Add the vegetable mixture and process just
  until combined.  Finish kneading by hand on a well-floured surface,
  sprinkling with 1/2 to 2/3 cup additional flour as needed, until
  elastic, moist, and velvety.
  
  First Rise:  Place the dough in an oiled bowl,  cover with plastic
  wrap, and let rise until doubled, 1 to 1
      1/2    hours.
  
  Shaping and Second Rise:  Shape the dough on a floured surface into 1
  large or 2 smaller round loaves by rolling the dough first into a
  taut log, then shaping it into a round loaf. The dough will be
  slightly sticky; sprinkle the dough and the work surface with flour
  while shaping it. Place each loaf on a peel sprinkled with cornmeal,
  cover with a slightly dampened towel, and let rise until doubled,
  about 50 minutes.
  
  Baking:  Thirty minutes before baking, heat the oven with baking
  stones in it to 425F.  Just before baking, cut an even slash around
  the shoulder of the loaf or 3 slashes across the top with a razor.
  Sprinkle the stones with cornmeal and slide the loaves onto the
  stones. bake, spraying 3 times with water in the first 10 minutes,
  for 45 minutes. Cool on racks.

 Categories: African, Condiments, Ceideburg 2

      4 lb Slightly under ripe peaches
      3 c  Sliced onions
    1/3 c  Olive oil
      1 tb Turmeric
      1 tb Ground cumin
      2 ts Minced garlic
      1 ts Minced ginger
      1 ts Dried red pepper
    1/2 ts Pepper
    1/2 ts Ground cardamom
    1/2 ts Dry mustard
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
    1/4 ts Ground cloves.
      2 c  White wine vinegar
    2/3 c  Firmly packed brown sugar
    2/3 c  White sugar
 
  Haven't made this for a couple of years, but it's pretty tasty. Saute
  onions in olive oil for five minutes or until tender. Add spices and
  saute for 2 minutes. Stir in vinegar and sugars, then simmer, partly
  covered for 15 minutes.
  
  Blanch peaches slightly in boiling water for 1 minute. Drain, peel
  pit and slice.  Add to onion mixture and simmer just until tender.
  Transfer with slotted spoon to sterilized mason jar.
  
  Reduce syrup over high heat to 1 1/2 cups.  Add slowly to jars to
  almost cover fruit.  Stir.  Fill jars slowly with syrup, cap loosely
  and cool.
  
  Tighten caps and let stand in dark place at least 2 weeks.
  
  I don't remember where this came from, but I suspect that it was
  either Gourmet or Sunset Magazine.  In my handwritten copy it also
  called for 2 teaspoons ground cumin as well as one tablespoon. I
  omitted it above, but I think it should have been 2 teaspoons ground
  coriander.

      Title: PICKLED ARTICHOKES
 Categories: Condiments, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2 c  Fresh lemon juice
      4 c  Water
     36    To 40 medium artichokes
      3    Lemons, halved
      4 c  Distilled white vinegar
    1/2 ts Salt
      2    Garlic cloves
      4    Bay leaves
    1/2 ts Dried basil
      1 ts Dried oregano
      2    To 4 small dried red chile
           -peppers (optional)
      2 c  Olive oil
 
  These pickles are worth every bit of the time it takes to prepare
  them. They're one of the best tasting and most beautiful preserves on
  my pantry shelf.  The pale, creamy yellow leaves around the artichoke
  heart glisten in the oil-herb vinegar brine, and sometimes a faint
  hint of purple on the chokes is evident, too. Their rustic taste
  recalls the simple antipasti of Italy's country trattorias.
  
  Combine the lemon juice and water in a saucepan large enough to
  eventually hold all the trimmed artichokes.
  
  Prepare the artichokes, one at a time.  Cut off and discard card the
  stem, then halve the artichoke from tip to stem end. Immediately rub
  the cut surface with a lemon half to prevent discoloring. Scoop out
  the furry choke, then gently rub the exposed surface with lemon. Cut
  off the outer layers of leaves, so the only leaves remaining are the
  tender, pale yellow ones.  Older or larger artichokes will have more
  tough outer leaves so more will have be removed than on younger or
  smaller artichokes. Immediately drop trimmed artichoke into the lemon
  water.
  
  Repeat process until all artichokes have been trimmed.
  
  Cook the artichokes in the lemon water for 3 to 5 minutes, depending
  upon size of artichoke hearts.  If mixed sizes are used, remove the
  small ones after 3 minutes. Drain artichoke hearts and pack them
  tightly into 2 clean, dry, pint canning jars with sealable lids. Add
  cup of vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon of salt to each jar. Cover with the
  lids and let stand overnight.
  
  The next day, drain off and discard the vinegar.  Add 1 cup of
  vinegar to each jar.  Let jars stand 4 to 6 hours. Drain off and
  discard vinegar. Add 1 garlic clove, 2 bay leaves, 1/4 teaspoon
  basil, 1/2 teaspoon oregano and 1 or 2 dried chiles (if desired) to
  each jar. Fill to within 1/2 inch of the rims with olive oil. Cover
  with the lids.
  
  At this point, the artichokes will keep up to 1 month stored in the
  refrigerator. alternately, they may be processed for 30 minutes in a
  canning kettle using the hot water process. The sealed, canned
  artichoke hearts keep up to 1 year.
  
  Makes 2 pints.

  artichokes, covering them by 1/4 inch and leaving 1/2 inch of space
  at the top of each jar. Slide a clean plastic chopstick or wooden
  skewer along the side of the jar to release any air bubbles. Wipe
  mouth of jar with a clean, damp cloth. Place hot lid on jar; screw on
  band firmly without forcing.
  
  5. Place a wire rack in the bottom of a large pot and fill partway
  with hot water. Using a jar lifter, place the jars on the rack. Add
  enough hot water to cover by 2 inches, and bring to a boil. Boil for
  10 minutes. Remove jars from water bath with jar lifter; let stand on
  clean dish towels for 24 hours. Check cool jars for the slight
  indentation in the lids that indicates a vacuum seal. Jars that do
  not seal properly or that leak during processing should be stored in
  the refrigerator and pickles consumed within a week. Allow sealed
  pickles to mellow in a cool, dry place for a few days before serving.
  Store opened jars in the refrigerator.

 Categories: Pickles
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lg Cabbage
    1/2 c  Salt
 
  "Cabbage is a frequent constituent of pickles, but this is the first
  time we have had it pickled alone. This make a very sharp pickle -
  almost a condiment that might be used in place of horseradish. It is
  very good in an oyster cocktail sauce and may be used sparingly as a
  relish for meats."
  
  White wine vinegar Cloves, mace and allspice
  
  Slice or shred the cabbage very fine.  Put it into an earthen dish and
  sprinkle with the salt, mixing it in well. Cover with another dish
  and let it stand for twenty-four hours.
  
  Drain the cabbage and take enough vinegar to cover it. Add, for each
  pint, four whole cloves, two blades of mace and four whole allspice.
  Boil the vinegar for two minutes and pour over the cabbage. Seal in
  pint jars. This amount makes about three pints.
  
  The directions for sealing are to "cover it close with a cloth. Then
  tie it over with leather," but we find that the glass jar method is
  more satisfactory.

           Stephen Ceideburg
      3    Carrots
    1/2 c  Rice vinegar
      1 tb Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  These pickles are often served as an accompaniment to grilled foods
  that are wrapped in lettuce and herbs at the table. You may also
  substitute daikon, radish, turnip, cucumber, garlic, etc. Peel the
  carrots; cut crosswise into 1/8-inch rounds. Combine the vinegar,
  sugar, salt and 1/2 cup of water in a small saucepan. Bring to a
  boil. Remove and let cool to room temperature. Add the carrot rounds
  to the mixture and marinate for at least 1 hour. Drain the carrots
  before using. Pickled carrots can be stored in a covered jar and
  refrigerated for 2 to 3 weeks. Mote: For a more appealing
  presentation, you can try carving the carrots into decorative shapes
  before slicing. Yield:
        2    cups.
  
  From "The Foods of Vietnam" by Nicole Rauthier. Stewart, Tabori &
  Chang. 1989. ISBN 1-55670-095-4 This is the very basic recipe that
  can be, as noted, varied almost infinitely. I most often see this
  done with about equal amounts of daikon and carrot shreds rather than
  the rounds.
