      Title: Almond and Rice Flour Bread with Poppy Seeds.
 Categories: Breads, Wheat free
      Yield: 18 servings
 
    1/2 c  Whole almonds, with skins
  1 1/2 c  Brown rice flour
      4 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
      3 ts Poppy seeds
    1/2 c  Plain low-fat yogurt
    1/2 c  Water
      1 lg Whole egg
      1 lg Egg white white
      2 tb Vegetable oil
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter an 8 x 4inch loaf pan.
  
  Place almonds and 1/2 cup of the flour in bowl of a food processor and
  grind until a fine meal is formed--the flour will prevent the nuts
  from turning oily. Add remaining rice flour, the baking powder, salt
  and 2 teaspoons of the poppy seeds; process briefly.
  
  Combine yogurt, water, whole egg, egg white and oil in a 2- cup
  measuring cup.
  
  With processor motor running, pour liquid ingredients through feed
  tube over flour mixture, processing just long enough to mix.
  
  Transfer batter to prepared pan. Sprinkle with remaining poppy seeds,
  and bake for 55 minutes. Turn out onto a rack to cool. (Bread slices
  best after several hours, or the next day).
  
  Makes one 18-ounce loaf (18 slices).

      Title: Blue Cheese Chips
 Categories: Crackers, Wheat free
      Yield: 130 servings
 
    1/2 lb (8 ounces) blue cheese,
           Broken into small pieces
      8 tb (1 stick) butter or
           Margarine, softened
      2 c  All-purpose or rice flour
    1/4 c  Buckwheat groats or chopped
           Toasted nuts of your choice
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/4 c  Milk
 
  "These "blue chips" are definitely a good investment that produce
  profitable returns in the form of compliments from all who try them.
  The texture is light and lacy, and the blue cheese flavor mellows
  with baking. Try serving them with a dry white wine. 305~F. 20 to 25
  minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F. Cream the butter and cheese
  together in the food processor, or in a large bowl using a pastry
  blender or two kinves. In another bowl, stir together the flour,
  buckwheat groats or nuts (if desired) and pepper. Add the flour
  mixture to the butter-cheese mixture and blend well.
  
  Blend in the milk, little by little, to form a dough that will hold
  together in a cohesive ball. The dough should be quite stiff. Divide
  it into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured surface or pastry
  cloth, roll out to about 3/16 inch thick. Cut into 1-1/2-inch circles
  and place on an ungreased baking sheet, making sure the edges do not
  touch. Prick each cracker in 1 or 2 places with the tines of a fork.
  
  Bake for 15 minutes, turn, and bake for an additional 5 to 10
  minutes, or until medium brown. Yield: 130-40.

      Title: Breadless Stuffing
 Categories: Stuffing, Wheat free
      Yield: 2 servings
 
           -No Ingredients
 
   Ruben Figarello at work mentioned this interesting
  variation on conventional stuffing, invented by his
  mother, just before thanksgiving. Begin with the
  standard cooked onions, turkey parts, (etc.) but
  instead of coarsely chopped bread, substitute coarsely
  chopped plantain. (I haven't tasted plantain, but
  accoding to the dictionary it grows like a banaa and
  taste rather like a potato). I've never had this so if
  anyone tries it, I'd like to hear how it comes out.

      1 c  Brown rice flour +
           -additional for dusting
           -loaves
  1 1/2 ts Granulated yeast
      2    Tesapoons sugar
  1 1/2 c  Warm water (110F)
      1 c  Corn flour
    1/2 c  Cornstarch
      2 ts Xantham gum powder
      1    To 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
      2 lg Eggs, at room temperature
      1 tb Corn oil
 
  Here's a couple of off beat bread recipes I thought might interest
  you. This and the following recipe are wheat free breads.
  
  Combine 1/2 cup of the rice flour, the yeast, sugar and 1/2 cup of
  the warm water in a 2-cup glass measure; stir to combine, then let
  rest in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 10 minutes.
  
  Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and draw two 8-inch
  circles on it.
  
  Combine remaining 1/2 cup rice flour, corn flour, cornstarch, xanthan
  gum powder and salt in a large bowl; mix to blend.
  
  Beat eggs lightly; set aside 1 tablespoon for brushing tops of
  loaves. Add remaining 1 cup warm water and the corn oil to beaten
  eggs. Using a wooden spoon, stir egg and yeast mixtures into flour
  and beat until smooth. Using a rubber spatula, spread soft dough into
  circles on marked parchment paper, heaping it up slightly in the
  center.
  
  Cover loaves lightly with greased plastic wrap and let rise until
  doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
  
  Preheat oven to 425F.
  
  Beat a few drops of water into the reserved beaten egg and brush over
  loaves.  Dust lightly with rice flour.  Using a razor blade, slash
  tops of loaves into a large diamond grid pattern.  (Use an
  up-and-down cutting motion rather than dragging the blade through the
  soft dough.)
  
  Bake for 20 minutes, until well browned.
  
  Makes two 8-inch diameter, 11-ounce loaves.

  stirring, until the mixture is thick and smooth.
  
  Pour the pudding into a lightly buttered or oiled 1-quart metal or
  porcelain mold or into 6 individual 6- to 8-oz custard molds and cool
  it to room temperature.  Then refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or
  until the pudding is firm.
  
  The pudding may be served directly from the mold(s) in which it
  chilled, or it may be unmolded in the following fashion: Run a thin,
  sharp knife around the inside edge of the mold and dip the bottom of
  the mold in hot water for a few seconds.  Place an inverted plate
  over the top of the mold and, grasping the plate and mold firmly
  together in both hands, quickly turn them upside down. Rap the plate
  sharply on the table. The pudding should slip out of the mold easily.
  If it doesn't repeat the whole process.

      Title: Quick and Easy Muffins (Gluten Free)
 Categories: Muffins, Wheat free
      Yield: 8 servings
 
    1/4 c  Sugar
      2 tb Shortening
      2    Eggs
      1 c  GF flour mix OR
      1 c  All rice flour
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 c  Milk or nondairy liquid
    1/4 ts Vanilla

--------------------------GF(GLUTEN-FREE FLOUR MIX--------------------------
      2    Parts white rice flour
    2/3    Part potato starch flour
    1/3    Part tapioca flour
 
  Quite awhile ago, someone was looking for Gluten-Free recipes. Since
  I have developed severe allergies to grains, it was suggested to me
  by somneone here on the echo that it could be the gluten content that
  was giving me trouble.  So I decided to try the gluten-free grains.
  The gluten-free grains do not interchange readily in baking recipes.
  A few days ago, I happened upon THE GLUTEN-FREE GOURMET Living Well
  Without Wheat by Bette Hagman at the Half Price Book Store.  This
  book is a real gem and I hope whoever was looking for gluten-free
  recipes sees this msg. We have tried a couple of the recipes and they
  really are pretty tasty--- I hadn't eaten a bakery item in over 3
  months! Here is the muffin recipe that I made on Easter morning and
  everyone thought they were good.
  
  In the mixing bowl, cream together sugar and shortening.  Then beat
  in the eggs.  Sift together the flour, salt, and baking powder and
  add to the egg mixture alternately with the milk.  Don't overbeat.
  Stir in the vanilla. These are best mixed by hand.  Pour into greased
  muffin cups. Bake in preheated 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes.
  Makes 8 muffins.

  NOTE:  I poured half the batter in the muffin tins and sprinkled a
  mixture of cinnamon and sugar over the batter.  I covered with the
  remaining batter and sprinkled the tops with more cinnamon and sugar.

      Title: Steamed Apricot Bread
 Categories: Breads, Wheat free
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    3/4 c  Rolled oats
    2/3 c  Brown rice flour
    1/4 c  Amaranth flour
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/2 c  Almonds
    3/4 c  Boiling water
    1/3 c  Molasses or honey
    1/2 ts Pure almond extract
    1/2 c  Dried apricots
 
  In a large bowl, combine the oats, rice flour, amaranth flour and
  baking soda.
  
  Grind the almonds to a fine powder in a blender.  Gradually add enough
  water to bring the level up to 1 cup.  With the machine running, add
  the molasses or honey and almond extract.  Add the apricots and
  process with a few on/off turns to chop them; do not puree.
  
  Pour the liquid mixture into the flour bowl.  Stir to mix.  Turn out
  into an oiled 1 qt. mold or 1 lb can.  Cover with a square of wax
  paper or foil (shiny side down); tie wax paper securely with a piece
  of string.
  
  Place the mold on a wire rack in a Dutch oven or large stockpot. Add
  enough boiling wate to the pot to come halfway up the sides of the
  mold. Cover the pot tightly, and steam the bread over med-low heat
  for 2 hours. Do not remove the cover during the cooking time.
  
  Remove the mold from the pot.  Cool the bread in the mold for 15 min,
  then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.  For best results,
  slice with a serrated knife.
  
  Variations:  Replace the rice flour with 1/3 c rice polish and 1/3 c
  rice bran.  You can also replace the amaranth flour with either 1/4 c
  soy flour, 1/4 c white buckwheat flour or 1/4 c ground sunflower
  seeds.

      Title: Zucchini and Walnut Cake
 Categories: Cakes, Wheat free
      Yield: 8 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Walnut pieces
      2 md Zucchini, unpeeled, ends
           -trimmed
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
    1/4 c  Brown rice flour
      1 ts Baking powder
      1 pn Salt
      3 lg Eggs
    3/4 c  Sugar
      2 tb Diced candied lemon peel,
           -finely minced
 
  Powdered sugar
  
  Preheat oven to 350F.  Butter the sides of an 8 x 2-inch cake pan,
  line the base with a circle of baking parchment and butter the
  parchment. Using a nut mill, grind walnuts to flour and set aside.
  Using the same nut mill, grind zucchini into fine shreds.  There
  should be 1 cup, firmly packed, or 6 ounces.  Place in a sieve and
  press out the liquid.  Combine cornstarch, rice flour, baking powder
  and salt; set aside.
  
  Beat eggs with sugar until lemon-colored and very thick.  A lifted
  beater should leave a slowly dissolving trail of batter.  Using a
  large rubber spatula, lightly fold in grated walnuts and minced lemon
  peel, as though mixing a souffle.  Fluff up zucchini shreds and fold
  in.  Sift cornstarch-flour mixture over batter and quickly fold in,
  retaining as much volume as possible.
  
  Pour into prepared pan (the batter will be loose) and bake for 40
  minutes, until a tester comes out dry.  Let cool in pan for 10
  minutes before unmolding onto a rack.  Peel off paper, reverse onto
  rack right side up, and let cool completely.
  
  Dust with powdered sugar before serving.
  
  Serves 8.
