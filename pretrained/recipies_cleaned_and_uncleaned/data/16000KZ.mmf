      Title: POTATO SALAD ALMOST LIKE MOM USED TO MAKE
 Categories: Salads, Vegetables
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      4 lb Boiling potatoes
           - white- or red-skinned
           - peeled and cut into
           - 1-inch pieces
    1/2 c  Sweet pickle juice
    1/2 c  Diced red onion
      1 c  Mayonnaise (can be light)
      1 c  Sour cream (can be light)
      3 tb Horseradish mustard
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1 c  Diced sweet pickles
    1/4 c  Chopped chives
      6    Hard-cooked eggs; shelled
           - and cut into 1-inch pieces
           Paprika for garnishing salad
 
  1. In a large saucepan cover the potato pieces with cold salted water
  and set over medium heat.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat
  slightly and cook uncovered, stirring a few times, until the potatoes
  are just tender, about 12 minutes.  Drain and transfer to a large
  bowl. Pour the pickle juice over the hot potatoes, stir gently and
  cool to room temperature. 2. Place the diced red onion in a small
  bowl and cover with ice water. Let sit 20 minutes to reduce the
  acidity. Drain and squeeze out the excess moisture with a paper
  towel.  Add to the potatoes. 3. In a medium bowl stir together the
  mayonnaise, sour cream, horseradish mustard, salt, pepper, pickles
  and chives. Pour this mixture over the potatoes and toss gently. Add
  the eggs and toss again.  Spoon into a serving container. The salad
  can be prepared up to 1 day ahead. Refrigerate, covered. 4. Sprinkle
  salad with paprika at serving time.

      Title: POTATO SALAD DRESSING
 Categories: Digest
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Fatfree Ranch Salad
           Dressing
      2 tb Reduced Fat Mayonnaise*
      1 ts Superfine sugar
      1 ts Celery seed
    1/2 ts Mild vinegar (I use rice
           Vinegar)
      1 ts Gourmet mustard of your
           Choice
      2 ds Garlic powder
 
  * I use reduced fat mayonnaise instead of fatfree because I think the
  fatfree is totally tasteless and why bother. I make this very rarely,
  so I justify the use of the mayonnaise to myself.
  
  This is better if you make the potato salad ahead of time and let it
  sit over night in the fridge so the tastes can marry well.
  
  I hope you enjoy it!

      Title: POTATO SOUP (LOW FAT)
 Categories: Soups, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  Get out a pot about the size of the amount of soup you want to make.
  Fill it about 1/2 full of water.  Peel and dice potatoes into bite
  size chunks, about 1 medium size per person. Put them into the water.
  Dice a medium size onion, add to the pot.  Peel a couple of carrots,
  slice then thin to cook in about the same amount of time as the
  potatoes. Bring to boil on the stove, turn down and simmer.  Season
  with salt and pepper to taste. (Lots of pepper, for my taste). When
  the potatoes and carrots are soft, add 1 can of evaporated skim milk.
  I do not thicken the soup with anything, but I do cook the potatoes
  till they are quite done. I put diced cheese into the bowls, ladle
  the hot soup into the bowls. If you used a low fat cheese, you could
  do this too, or you can skip the cheese. Also, to make a more filling
  soup, I add "rivells" to my soup (for a low fat soup, you would have
  to use egg substitute).  Take 1 or 2 eggs, beaten slightly, add 1
  half eggshell full of milk, and salt to taste, then flour to make a
  fairly stiff dough, drop little bits of this from a fork into the
  boiling soup. If you add the rivells just after the soup boils, they
  will be done when the potatoes are done, proceed with the evaporated
  milk, etc. The above soup would have no fat, (except the rivells
  version) till you add the cheese. Oh, yes, if I have celery, I throw
  in a stalk or two diced with the onion and carrot. You can't make
  anything any simplier.

 Categories: Soups/stews
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Boiling potatoes
    3/4 lb Bacon
      1 lb Kale
      2    Cloves garlic
           Salt and pepper
      1 c  Heavy cream
           Chicken stock as necessary
      5 ts Balsamic vinegar
      1    Bunch chives
           Diced green onion tops/botto
 
  Peel potatoes and put in a pot with cold, salted water to cover.
  Cover pot and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer, uncover, and
  cook until done, about 25 minutes. Drain, reserving cooking liquid.
  Break up the potatoes with a potato masher (they should be quite
  lumpy, not smooth). Meanwhile, cook the bacon over low heat until
  crisp, turning often. Drain and chop into 1/2 inch chunks. Pour off
  all but 2 TBS of the bacon fat, and, reserve extra fat. Stem and chop
  the kale. Mince the garlic. Put half the kale and half the garlic
  into the frying pan. Season with salt and pepper and cook over medium
  heat until kale is wilted, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl. Repeat
  using more bacon fat as needed. Return all kale to the fry pan and
  add the heavy cream. Simmer over very low heat until the kale is
  tender, about 10 more minutes. Combine potatoes with about 3 cups of
  the potato cooking liquid and 1 cup of the chicken stock. Add more
  stock if needed to get a good consistency. Add kale mixture (with the
  bacon) to the pot and bring to a simmer. Season to taste with the
  vinegar and salt and pepper. This is up to you as to how much vinegar
  you use. Mince the chives or green onions and place in an extra bowl
  to top the soup. I hope you find this excellent soup. It is great
  this time of year as it is much like a warm German Potato salad.  If
  you pass this one up you will be the loser. Take care from Ken/still

      Title: POTATO SOURDOUGH STARTER
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -NORMA WRENN   (NPXR56B)
      1 pk Dry yeast
      4 c  -warm water
      2 tb Sugar
      4 c  Flour
      1    Potato; raw quartered
 
  Here is a recipe from Texas Highways Cookbook.
  
  Dissolve yeast in warm water; and then mix all ingredients in a
  1-gallon crock.  (Do not use metal container) Cover with a
  close-fitting lid and let the starter rise until light (12 hours in
  warm weather, longer in cool weather). Do not let the starter get
  cold, ever. After using part of the starter, add 1 cup warm water, 2
  teaspoons sugar, and enough flour to mix to the starter's original
  consistency.  Add more potato occasionally as food for the yeast, but
  don't add more yeast. Use daily for best results. Starter improves
  with age. I am sure you will get some posts for flake starters.  I do
  not have one.

      2 ts Double-acting baking powder
 
  (From Dorie Greenspan's "Waffles From Morning to Midnight" (Morrow).
  
  Makes about 6 6-1/2" waffles.
  
  Peel, wash and cut the potatoes into uniform small pieces. Put in a
  large pot with cold water to cover, salt well, and bring to a boil.
  Then lower heat and cook until potatoes can be pierced easily with a
  fork; drain, reserving about 1/2 cup of potato water. Transfer
  potatoes to a large mixing bowl. While potatoes cook, heat olive oil
  and chopped onion in a small skillet over low heat just until onion
  softens a bit. Pour oil and onion over drained potatoes. Add milk to
  still-warm skillet - just to take chill off - then pour milk over
  potatoes. Using a fork, a potato masher or a rubber spatula, mash
  potatoes with oil and milk. Add 1/4 cup of warm potato water,
  reserving rest, and continue to mash until mixture is smooth. Taste
  potatoes and season liberally with salt and freshly ground pepper.
  Preheat waffle iron and finish batter by beating eggs into potatoes
  with a whisk or handheld mixer. Whisk together flour and baking
  powder and fold into potato mixture with a rubber spatula. Lightly
  butter or spray waffle iron grids. (You can skip this step with
  well-seasoned or non-stick materials.) Scrape batter by half-cup
  measure onto hot iron, smoothing batter evenly almost to edge of
  grids. Close iron and bake until brown and crisp.

      Title: POTATO-CARROT KUGEL
 Categories: Vegetables, Entrees, Jewish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      6 lg Potatoes, peeled
           -(about 4 lb)
      4    Carrots, peeled
      1 lg Onion, peeled
      2 md Eggs
      4 tb Chicken fat, melted
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar
      4 tb Flour, all-purpose
    1/2 ts Black pepper, ground
      2 tb Parsley, chopped
           Paprika
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Grease a pan that is about 8x8 inches.
  
  Break one egg into blender; start blender at high speed. Add half of
  onion, three of the potatoes (cut up into about 1-inch pieces) and
  two of the carrots (cut up into similar pieces). Blend till smooth.
  Empty blender into large mixing bowl. Repeat with other egg and
  remainder of onion, potatoes and carrots.
  
  Stir in chicken fat, salt, sugar, flour, black pepper and parsley.
  Pour into pan, sprinkle top with paprika, and bake for 1 hour or
  until browned.
  
  For a pareve version, substitute for the chicken fat about 4
  tablespoons vegetable oil, and for flavor, optionally substitute for
  the salt and sugar about 1 tablespoon pareve imitation chicken soup
  mix (I use Croyden House brand, made in USA).  It is supposedly
  pareve/kosher for Passover. For kosher l'pesach (Passover), use about
  4 tablespoon matzo meal, plus about 1 tablespoon potato starch in
  place of the flour.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Kugel with potatoes and carrots -- I have adapted this recipe from
  a recipe for "Blender potato kugel" by Marilyn Michelson in the
  "Temple Emanuel Sisterhood Cook Book," compiled 1968 (no copyright
  notice), Baltimore, Maryland. The carrot part is my idea (it gives
  the kugel a golden color and also a better flavor, I think). This
  dish smells wonderful, tastes great, and is definitely filling.
  
  With suitable modifications (see notes) this dish can be made kosher
  for Passover.  Yield:  Serves 4-6.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      2 lg Leeks *
      1 ts Salt

  until wilted. Season with salt and pepper, then add to potatoes and
  mix well.
  
  Heat remaining butter in a heavy skillet, preferably a nonstick one,
  and add potato-leek mixture. Flatten to make a pancake, then cover
  and cook about 5 minutes over medium-high heat.
  
  Turn pancake and cook until brown and crisp.

  Preheat the oven to 425 F.
  
  Wash and dry the potatoes. Spread the salt evenly on a baking sheet.
  Place the potatoes on the salt and bake for about 45 min. Remove the
  potatoes from the oven and dust off any salt that is sticking to the
  skins.
  
  Place the remaining ingredients except the reserved cooking liquid in
  the bowl of a food processor. Split the potatoes lengthwise and, with
  a spoon, scoop out the flesh and place in the processor. Blend on
  high speed for 45 seconds. If the sauce is too thick, dilute to
  desired consistency with the reserved bean cooking liquid. The
  consistency of the sauce should range between mayonnaise and cream.

      Title: POTATO-SORREL SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 tb Butter
      7 c  Water
      3 md Leeks; the white parts only
           - chopped or cut
           - into 1/4-inch rounds
      6 c  Loosely packed sorrel leaves
           -the stems removed and
           - leaves roughly chopped
    1/2 ts Salt (to taste)
  1 1/2 lb Red potatoes; quartered
           - lengthwise & thinly sliced
           Freshly ground pepper
           Creme fraiche
      1 tb Chives
           - thinly sliced or snipped
 
  This is a rather rustic soup. For a more refined version, pass it
  through a food mill before serving.
  
  MELT THE BUTTER IN A SOUP POT and add 1/2 cup water. Add the leeks,
  sorrel and salt, then cook gently, covered, for 5 minutes over
  medium-low heat. Add the potatoes and cook another 10 minutes,
  stirring occasionally, then pour in the rest of the water and
  gradually bring the soup to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer until
  the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Once the potatoes are
  soft, help break them down by pressing them against the side of the
  pan, making the soup as rough or smooth as you like. Or, if you
  prefer, pass the soup through a food mill. Taste the soup for salt
  and add more, if necessary. Serve with freshly ground pepper, a
  spoonful of creme fraiche swirled in and a delicate sprinkling of
  chives over the top. If you've got garden chives and they're in
  bloom, separate the individual flowers at the base and sprinkle on a
  few along with the green stems.

  Heat 1 tb oil in heavy large non-stick skillet over high heat. Add
  potatoes and cook until golden, stirring often, about 8 minutes.
  Reduce heat to low. Add chili powder and cumin and cook 2 minutes.
  Add tomatoes, sliced green onions and tomato sauce. Cover and cook
  until potatoes are tender, about 6 minutes. Add 1/3 c Jack cheese,
  egg, cilantro, and jalapeno and stir until cheese melts. Season with

  Brush large skillet with oil and place over medium heat. Add 1
  tortilla and cook until softened, 30 seconds per side. Transfer to
  work surface. Top tortilla with 1/3 cup filling and roll up. Place
  seam side down in baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas and
  filling, brushing skillet with oil as necessary. (Can be made 2 hours
  ahead. Cover and chill.)

  Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in heavy large skillet over high heat.
  Add chopped onions and garlic and saute 5 minutes. Mix in cumin
  seeds, chili powder, dried oregano and ground cinnamon and saute 1
  minute. Add enchilada sauce and tomato sauce and simmer 2 minutes.
  Mix in fresh lime juice. Season to taste with salt and cayenne
  pepper. (Can be prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Reheat
  before using.)

  Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Pour enchilada sauce over enchiladas.
  Sprinkle with feta and remaining 1 1/3 cups Jack cheese. Cover with
  foil. Bake until heated through and bubbling, about 30 minutes. Serve
  with sour cream and green onions.
  
  Note: Although I'm sure that the _Bon Appetite_ chefs know exactly
  what they are talking about, I find that, at high temperatures, olive
  oil breaks down a great deal, begins to smoke, and sets off fire
  alarms all over. I use peanut oil and a wok to saute potatoes since,
  as far as skillets go, I don't have non-stick and heavy all in one.
  Additionally, I don't use any extra salt in the dish, finding it
  amply seasoned without.

      Title: POTATO-VEGETABLE CHOWDER
 Categories: Vegetarian, Soups
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      5 c  Vegetable broth (water is
           -fine, but not as tasty)
      1 c  Tomato or vegetable juice
      1 c  Tomatoes; peeled, cut in

      1 c  Leek; chopped
      2 c  Potatoes, red; diced
      1    Cheesecloth bag of fresh
           -herbs of choice (parsley,
           -basil, etc.)
      2 ts Salt
 
   Bring liquid to boil in a deep soup kettle. Add all vegetables and
  seasonings. Turn down heat to simmer and partially cover the pot.
  Simmer until vegetables are tender. Serve hot with crusty whole wheat
  bread and a light fruit dessert.
  
   Variation: Almost any vegetable but onions, tomatoes, and the
  potatoes can be substituted for another vegetable. Don't use the
  cabbage family because the flavor is too radically changed. Green
  peas and baby lima beans are a great addition, as are corn kernels
  (about 1/2 cup).

  These are *not* fluffy dumplings as in chicken and dumplings. They
  are a "sturdy" potato dumpling served as a side dish to meat, and
  usually with a sweet sauerkraut/carraway/honey dish as the vegetable.
  
  *                       *                       *
  
  Boil peeled potatoes in small quantity of water. Drain potatoes
  thoroughly. Rice potatoes through hand held masher/ricer. Let
  potatoes cool. On floured board, gradually add flour working mixture
  into dough with hands. Shape potato mixture into a long roll and cut
  into 10 slices. Drop dumplings into boiling water and boil gently
  about 5 minutes.
  
  Drain dumplings on paper towel.  The dumplings are fully cooked after
  the boiling process, but traditionally, Czechoslovakians then melt
  butter in a heavy frying pan, and fry the dumplings until they are
  lightly browned on all sides.

 Categories: Side dish
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    350 g  Potatoes; peeled
     25 g  Butter
           Eggs (1 or 2 per person)
           Salt and pepper
 
  A crispy cake of julienne potatoes cooked in butter makes a delicious
  base for lightly cooked eggs. A perfect supper dish which costs next
  to nothing, a memorable meal served with a soft lettuce salad and
  some fresh bread.
  
  Cut the potatoes into strips ('julienne'). Wash them in cold water
  and dry thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper. Heat the butter in a
  heavy frying pan and saute the potatoes until they are well coated,
  then press them down into a cake with the back of a fork. Brown on
  one side only over a very low heat, covered with a lid, for 30
  minutes. When well browned, loosen around the edges and carefully
  invert on to a platter, and keep warm.
  
  Put a little more butter into the pan and heat gently. Break one or
  two eggs per person into the pan and cook through gently until they
  set lightly, without browning the whites (oeufs sur le plat are a far
  cry from a fried egg!). Serve on wedges of the potato cake.

  strips, taking care not to include any of the bitter white pith. On a
  cutting board finely chop the zest with the parsley and garlic. 2)
  Place the potatoes in a medium saucepan and add enough water to cover
  them by 1 inch.  Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to
  moderately high and cook the potatoes until tender, approximately 15
  minutes. 3) Drain the potatoes in a colander and return them to the
  sauce pan. Using a potato masher, mash potatoes over a very low heat,
  gradually incorporating the heavy cream and the butter.  Stir in the
  salt and the gremolada and serve immediately.

  :          Potato Roll--
        5    baking potat  peeled and
  :          quartered
        2 TB butter -- room temperature
        1 c  milk
        4 TB Parmesan cheese -- freshly
  :          grated
      1/2 ts parsley -- minced
        1 ts baking powder
        2 TB flour
        3    eggs -- separated
  :          Salt and pepper to taste
  :          Cilantro sprigs for garnish
  
  To make the filling, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter and saut=E9 the
  onion and pimiento until they are soft. Add the shrimp and continue
  to cook just until the shrimp turns pink. Stir in the minced parsley
  and set aside.
  
  In a saucepan melt the remaining 3 tablespoons butter and stir in the
  flour. Using a wire whisk, gradually stir in the milk. Cook over low
  heat until the sauce is thickened. Stir in the shrimp mixture and
  correct the seasoning. Cool to room temperature before filling the
  potato roll.
  
  To prepare the potato roll, boil the potatoes until they are very
  tender. Drain and mash them. Mix in the butter, 3/4 cup of the milk,
  the cheese, parsley, baking powder, and flour. Lightly beat the egg
  yolks with the remaining 1/4 cup milk and add to the potato mixture.
  Add salt and pepper to taste. Beat the egg whites until they hold
  soft peaks and fold them into the potatoes. (This is a dish typical
  of Brazil which can be made ahead and baked just before serving.)
  
  Line a jelly-roll pan with foil and butter the foil well. Starting in
  the center, spread the potato mixture on the foil with a rubber
  spatula. It may not completely fill the pan. Bake at 400 degrees for
  about 25 minutes or until the top is lightly browned. Remove from the
  oven and carefully invert onto a damp tea towel. Cool for 5 minutes
  and then carefully peel off the= foil.
  
  To assemble the rocambole, carefully spread the cooked potato with
  shrimp filling, and, using the towel as a helper, roll up, jelly-roll
  style. Serve warm, cut in 1 1/2-inch thick slices garnished with
  cilantro sprigs.

  Slice the raw potatoes as thinly as possible and, using a biscuit
  cutter, cut out circles.
  
  In a heavy pan heat enough butter, about 25 g (1 oz), to cover the
  bottom. Saut the potato circles on both sides, one layer at a time,
  until they are just cooked.
  
  Butter a small ovenproof dish, and rub the bottom with a cut clove of
  garlic. Melt the remaining butter. Make layers of overlapping potato
  circles, brushing them with melted butter and seasoning with salt and
  pepper. Then brush with the melted butter. Place under the grill for

  Well, it is not very spicy as long as you use small quantities of
  fenugreek. You will be surprised at how strongly bitter the spice is
  if you use it in larger amounts. I could post my recipe for curry
  powder using fenugreek if anybody wants it, I generally use this
  powder to make a spicy lentil stew called 'sambhar'.

  Note 1: the Indian name of this dish is Pyazwale Sookhe Aloo. Note 2:
  use a salt-substitute instead of salt Note 3: I've made this without
  the asafetida because I don't know where

 Categories: Vegetables, August
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
        x  Potatoes, cooked, peeled,
           3/4-inch dice
        x  Cumin seeds
        x  Black mustard seeds
        x  Sesame seeds
        x  Salt
        x  Cayenne
        x  Lemon juice
 
  There should be equal amounts cumin and black mustard seeds, and
  plenty more sesame seeds.  Only a little lemon juice - it has a
  strong flavor. Cayenne has an _extremely_ intense flavor, so use it
  judiciously. Heat some oil in a pan.  When hot, throw in all the
  seeds. When the black mustard seeds begin popping, throw in the
  potatoes and other spices. Cook until the potatoes are as done as you
  like them.

  * peeled and thinly sliced (5 medium, see note)
  
  Soak salt cod overnight, changing water at least once.
  
  The next day, drain and place salt cod and milk in pan. In a sauce
  pan, cover and cook over medium heat 8 minutes. Remove salt from pan.
  Pour milk through strainer and set milk aside. Flake and discard any
  skin and bones. Set cod aside.

  stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in flour.
  Stir in reserved milk, potatoes and pepper. Increase heat to medium.
  Cover and cook 15 minutes. Add cod and remove from heat.
  
  This soup may be made up to a day in advance to this point. Cool,
  cover and refrigerate.
  
  Place sour cream in small bowl. Reheat soup over medium heat until
  piping hot. Thin sour cream with 1/2 cup hot soup, then pour mixture
  into soup pot. Do not heat soup again or sour cream will curdle. Pour
  soup into tureen, sprinkle with fresh dill and serve.
  
  Note: Other white fish, such as fresh cod, halibut or flounder, be
  used, either in combination with salt cod or by themselves,
  
  Note: Use waxy, less starchy potatoes, such as new potatoes, low

           -3-5 inches wide
      3    Canned chipotie chilies in
           -adobo sauce
      3 tb Oyster sauce
    1/3 c  Vegetable oil
      1 lg Red onion; sliced

           -bell peppers; sliced
           Salt
      4 oz Mexican chihuahua or other
           -good melting cheese
 
  Note: look for canned chipotle chilies and oyster sauce in the ethnic
  section of your supermarket. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cut stems
  off portobellos and use for another purpose, such as duxelles. Clean
  caps with a wet cloth.  Bake mushrooms about 3 minutes ~ longer if
  you are going to eat them with a fork. Meanwhile puree chipotles and
  oyster sauce in a blender until smooth; add a little water if
  necessary. Set aside. Heat oil over medium heat in a large saute pan.
  Saute onions and poblanos until mixture begins to wilt, then add salt
  to taste. Mixture should be somewhat moist rather than dry because
  onion and chilies can dry out in oven. Continue to saute 3 minutes,
  then remove from heat and cool. Place portobellos with gill side up
  in front of you. Brush top with chipotle-oyster sauce mixture. Top
  with onion mixture. Place mushrooms on baking sheet and bake 5
  minutes. Remove and spread cheese over tops. Return mushrooms to oven
  and bake another minute or until all cheese is melted. Serve
  immediately.

      Title: POTROASTED KID~ LOCARNO STYLE (CAPRETTO ALLA
 Categories: Swiss, Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Boneless kid or lamb
           Salt
           Pepper
      3 tb Butter
  1 1/2 ts Ground sage, or
  2 1/2 ts Fresh sage
      6    Juniper berries, crushed
    1/2 ts Dried mint, or
      1 tb Fresh mint
    1/8 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/8 ts Nutmeg (fresh if poss.)
      1 c  Dry white wine
      1 c  Heavy cream
      1 tb Rum
 
  Cut the meat into bite-sized pieces.  Sprinkle the meat with the salt
  and pepper.  Heat the butter in a casserole, and add the sage,
  juniper berries, mint, cinnamon and nutmeg. Cook, stirring
  constantly, for 3 minutes. Add the meat and brown on all sides.
  Lower the heat and add the wine. Simmer, covered, until the meat is
  tender (it took me a little more than an hour with the kid I had).
  Remove the meat and keep warm. Strain the sauce. Put the sauce back
  in the casserole, and stir in the cream and rum. Bring to a boil and
  reduce to the consistency of heavy cream. Return the meat to the
  sauce and heat through.  Serve with dry boiled rice and green peas.
  (it says here: but I served it with wide homemade egg noodles, and I
  think that works better than rice would, even if not strictly the way
  they would do it in Locarno.)

      Yield: 24 Dumplings
 
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
    1/2 lb Napa cabbage
      2 ts Kosher salt
    3/4 lb Coarsely-ground pork
      1 tb Finely-minced fresh ginger
      1 tb Minced garlic
    1/3 c  Coarsely-chopped scallions
      1 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Chinese rice wine
      1 tb Toasted sesame oil
    1/4 ts Freshly-ground pepper
     24 ea Round wonton wrappers
    1/4 c  Oil, for pan-frying
      2 c  Stock

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
    1/3 c  Soy sauce
      3 tb White vinegar
      1 tb Toasted sesame oil
      1 ts Chinese chili sauce
    1/3 ts Sugar
      2 tb Thinly-sliced scallions
 
  Make filling: Chop cabbage to small pieces, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon
  of salt and toss well. Let stand 10 minutes, drain, then squeeze
  firmly to wring out excess moisture. In a large mixing bowl scatter
  cabbage and add pork. Sprinkle remaining filling ingredients on top.
  Using chopsticks, stir briskly in one direction until well-blended.
  Throw mixture against inside of bowl 5 to 6 times to compact it.
  Press plastic wrap on surface of filling and set aside 30 minutes at
  room temperature, or refrigerate up to 24 hours for flavor to
  develop. Bring to room temperature before using .
  
  Fill one wrapper at a time, keeping remaining covered. Heap 1 level
  tablespoon filling off-center in wrapper and shape into a half-moon,
  about 2 inches. Run a moist finger lightly around edge of wrapper.
  Pleat and press dumpling closed. Transfer dumplings as they are made
  to a lightly-floured baking sheet and keep them covered with a towel
  to prevent drying.
  
  Make sauce: About 20 minutes before serving, mix dipping sauce
  ingredients and season to taste.
  
  Heat a heavy 12-inch cast-iron skillet with a tight-fitting cover
  over high heat. When very hot, add enough oil to coat bottom with a
  scant 1/4-inch, swirl skillet to coat bottom and sides, and reduce
  heat to medium. When oil is hot, pick up dumplings by their tops and
  quickly arrange them, smooth side down, in concentric rings starting
  from outside of pan and working into center. You will be able to cook
  about half of dumplings at a time. Dumplings should hug each other
  tightly in a pretty spiral; they will stick together. Adjust heat so
  they sizzle mildly. When all dumplings are in place, raise heat to
  brown bottoms. Check frequently, and when bottoms are browned, add
  enough stock to come halfway up sides of dumplings. Adjust heat to
  simmering and cover. After about 7 minutes, check to see if almost
  all stock has been absorbed. Check bottoms of dumplings -- they
  should be crisp enough to "clink" against a fingernail. If needed,
  add a little more oil down side of pan, swirl to distribute under
  dumplings and continue frying until crisp.
  
  Loosen dumplings from bottom with a spatula and invert them onto a
  warmed serving platter, browned bottoms up ~- they should cling in a
  spiral. Spoon dumpling sauce into individual saucers or dipping bowls
  and serve immediately. Do this in two pans at once, or repeat to cook
  remaining potstickers.

      2 tb Peanut Oil
    1/2 c  Chicken Stock; mixed with
  1 1/2 c  Water

MMMMM------------------SOY VINEGAR CHILE SAUCE-----------------------
      4 tb White Vinegar
      2 tb Light Soy Sauce
      3 dr Chile Oil
      1 ts Cilantro; minced
 
  Put flour into a food processor fitted with a metal blade. As soon as
  water comes to a boil, with the machine running, pour down the feed
  tube in a steady stream. Process until dough forms a rough ball and
  pulls away from sides, about 30 seconds. Turn out onto a work
  surface. Flour lightly and knead until dough no longer feels sticky
  and has a firm, smooth consistency, about 2 minutes. Cover and let
  rest while preparing filling.
  
  Put half the cabbage leaves in a food processor. Pulse 4-5 times to a
  coarse mince. Remove. Process remaining cabbage in same manner. Wrap
  cabbage in a towel and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. You
  should have about 1 1/4 cups. Set aside.
  
  With processor running, drop ginger, green onions and cilantro down
  feed tube; process until finely minced, about 15 seconds. Add salt,
  white pepper, sugar, soy sauce, wine, sesame oil and cornstarch;
  pulse to mix. Add pork; process until finely ground, about 20
  seconds. Return cabbage to processor; pulse to mix. Do not puree.
  Remove to a bowl, cover and refrigerate.
  
  Dust dough with flour. Knead 2-3 minute,s or until smooth. Roll out
  to an 1/8" thick sheet. Cut out 4" rounds; keep covered.
  
  Put 1 tb filling in center of a round. Bring sides of round up over
  filling and pinch edge of top of arc to seal. On curved rim of near
  side, make 3 small pleats to the left of center; make 3 pleats in the
  opposite direction along the other side. Pinch pleated side together
  with unpleated side to enclose filling to make a 1/2" flat border on
  top. Set dumpling on flat surface with its pleated side facing away
  from you. Put both thumbs on the smooth side pushing filling forward
  away from you while pulling ends toward you to form a pouch or belly.
  Gently flatten dumpling's bottom to create a platform. Set on a tray,
  cover and refrigerate, or freeze until ready to cook. Repeat, making
  remaining dumplings.
  
  Heat a 9" nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil and arrange
  8-10 dumplings platform side down in skillet, touching each other in
  a spiral fashion. Fry until bottoms are browned and crusty, about 1
  minute. (Lift one to check.)
  
  Add enough diluted chicken stock to come halfway up dumplings; bring
  to a boil. Reduce to a low boil and cover; cook until liquid has been
  reduced (about 7 minutes.) Gently shake pan from time to time. Pan
  should not be dry before cooking time is up; therefore, add water if
  it reduces too quickly. Remove cover and nudge with a spatula to
  loosen dumplings. Increase heat to high, and fry until pan is dry and
  dumpling bottoms are crisp, about 30 seconds. Invert a 8-9" flat
  plate over potstickers an turn pan upside down. Repeat with remaining
  dumplings.
  
  Combine dipping sauce ingredients together, stir once or twice and
  serve with dumplings.

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
           Hot chili oil
           Red rice vinegar
           Soy sauce
 
  In a bowl, combine flour and water, mixing to form a ball. Remove to a
  floured board and knead with your palm for about 3 minutes. Shape
  into a ball, cover with a damp towel, and let stand for about 10
  minutes.
  
  Make the filling by combining the filling ingredients above.
  Refrigerate until ready to use.
  
  To shape and assemble, knead dough for about 3 minutes. Roll into a
  cylinder that is about 1 inch in diameter. Cut off the ends, then cut
  into about 24 pieces, each about 3/4-inch wide. With the cut side up,
  press the dough down with your palm to flatten. Use a rolling pin to
  make pancakes about 2 1/2 - 3 inches in diameter. (They get quite
  thin; that's what you want.)
  
  Spoon about 1 tablespoon of filling into the center of each pancake.
  Fold the dough over to make a half circle and pleat the edges firmly
  together.
  
  To pan-fry, heat cast-iron or other heavy-bottom skillet over moderate
  heat. Add about 3 T oil, swirling to coat bottom. (Watch out, it
  sizzles quite a bit. Don't get burned!) When oil is hot, place
  potstickers, seam side up, in skillet and agitate (shake) for 30
  seconds. Pour in water, cover and gently boil over moderate heat for
  7 to 8 minutes. When oil and water start to sizzle, add remaining 2 T
  oil. Tip skillet to distribute oil evenly; watch carefully
  (uncovered) to prevent sticking. When bottoms are brown (usually
  several minutes later), remove from heat and carefully lift out
  potstickers with spatula.
  
  To serve, turn potstickers over (dark side up) and arrange on serving
  platter. Combine chili oil, vinegar and soy sauce in proportions to
  suit your taste and offer sauce for dipping. Alternatively, cut up a
  hot chili pepper into red rice vinegar.

           See Part 1
 
  : Continued from Part 1
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Delicious Northern Chinese snack and hacker's staple -- Hackers on
  both coasts and most places in between love potstickers (though if
  you're from the Right Coast, you probably know them as Peking
  Ravioli, or just ravs. This recipe is based on one found in Chef
  Chu's Distinctive Cuisine of China. Total preparation time is about
  45 minutes. They don't come out as good as the ones from Cho's in
  Mountain View, but if you don't happen to be within 45 minutes of
  Mountain View, they'll do very nicely, thank you. Yield:  Makes about
  2 dozen.
  
  *  You can freeze uncooked potstickers for later use, if you squeeze
  out the water from the cabbage during preparation (in a colander or
  cheesecloth). Freeze potstickers separately on cookie sheets until
  firm, then put them in plastic bags. When rolling out the pancakes,
  leave the centers slightly thicker than the edges. A thicker center
  will hold up better during the browning.
  
  *  If you prefer, steam potstickers for about 12 minutes over boiling
  water instead of pan-frying.  (No self-respecting hacker would be
  caught eating steamed potstickers, though.)
  
  *  These are really not hard to make, and come out quite nicely!
  Following the dough recipe above leads to a fairly dry and floury
  dough; this makes it hard to roll out and pleat. Feel free to add a
  little more water. There are also now commercially available
  potsticker presses that take care of folding and pleating; they're
  cheap and plastic and work rather well.
  
  *  The perfect potsticker is uniformly brown with a thick brown area
  on the bottom (where it sticks to the pot); it seems that achieving
  this only comes with practice. I tend to fry both sides a bit before
  adding the water; this helps. Beware of too much heat; the bottom
  will bubble and crack.  This doesn't taste any different, but doesn't
  look as nice.
  
  *  If you don't cook the whole batch at once, store the potstickers
  so that they don't touch; the dough tends to stick to itself, so the
  potstickers may tear as you remove them.
  
  *  Many restaurants serve Hoy Sin sauce (hoisin) instead of hot sauce.

      1 x  Salt & pepper
      1 x  Cayenne
      1 x  Mustard
      1 x  Butter, melted
 
  Chop and pound to a paste any fragments of cooked ham, tongue,
  poultry, game or fish. With ham use a quarter part of fat. Remove all
  gristle and skin and pound until free from any fibre and reduced to a
  paste. Season highly with salt, pepper, cayenne, and made mustard,
  and moisten with a little melted butter (except ham, which has fat
  enough). Pack closely in small stone or earthen jars. Put jars in
  steamer and heat for one half hour. Then press the meat down again
  and cover with hot melted butter. This will keep some time and may be
  served in slices or used for sandwiches. Ham and tongue may be mixed
  with veal or chicken. Beef, game and fish are better alone. Source:

    225 g  (8 oz) small spring carrots
    225 g  (8 oz) small onions
           -(pickling size)

      2 lg Egg yolks
    300 ml (1/2 pint) double cream
 
  I made this one last night and was quite pleased with it, though the
  sauce turned out a bit thin.  I probably didn't cook the sauce long
  enough but I was afraid of curdling it, something I've been quite
  good at lately. BTW, I couldn't find any white burgundy so I used
  white Zinfandel instead.
  
  Wipe the chicken inside and out with a cloth wrung out in boiling
  water. Cut into 10 serving pieces:  2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, 2 wings
  and 2 breasts halved. Scrape the carrots and peel the onions. Wipe
  the mushrooms with a damp cloth and trim the stalks.  Melt the butter
  in a heavy iron cocotte [heavy frying pan or Dutch oven. S.C.] over

  cook about 3 minutes. Sprinkle with flour and cook, stirring, another

  chicken thighs and drumsticks in the casserole with any accumulated
  juices from the chicken. Cover and bring to a boil. Place the
  casserole in the oven. After 15 minutes, add the reserved breasts and
  cook 20 minutes longer. Remove from the oven, remove the chicken from
  the casserole and set aside. Strain the sauce through a fine sieve
  and discard vegetables. Place bacon in another medium oven-proof pot
  on the stove over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5
  minutes. Pour off excess fat and add the mushrooms, brandy, milk,
  cream and braising sauce. Mix well. Arrange chicken pieces on the
  bacon-mushroom mixture, cover and place in the oven for 15 minutes or
  until bubbling hot. To serve, arrange the chicken pieces on a platter
  and spoon the bacon, mushrooms and sauce over the top and garnish

  the oven heat to 350 and cook 30 minutes longer  or until chicken is
  done, basting often. Cook the potatoes in the remaining butter until
  brown and tender and put them on top of the vegetables in the
  casserole.  Sprinkle chopped parsley over all. Recipe directs that
  all be served from the casserole but as you'll remember, you have to
  cut it into serving pieces first. Other vegetables like asparagus and
  or peas can be added if desired. Louis Diat French Cooking For

  PS:  This makes a big cake which will keep much longer than I've ever
  seen one last.  It's also almost impossible to overbake. A couple
  years ago I was making one as an Xmas gift for friends. I went to
  bed, forgetting to remove the cake from the oven, and it baked all
  night long. When I finally got it out of the oven (over 7 hours after
  it went in) the cake was perfectly OK except for a suface layer about
  " deep that was a bit dry. I made another cake for the gift, but my
  family gobbled the "mistake" in short order.

      6    Eggs

  There are many historical references to saffron cordials made by
  prolonged steeping of the spice in brandy and other alcohol. I have
  been making this brandy cake for years and decided to try it with
  saffron. It did not work; the saffron did not come through at all. My
  tasters loved the cake, however, and suggested the saffron go in some
  kind of icing instead. Great suggestion.
  
  Cream butter and sugar, then add eggs, one at a time. Sift flour and
  add it gradually.  Add remaining ingredients, mix just until
  combined. Preheat oven to 375F (190C). Bake in a greased and floured
  bundt or ring pan for about 50 minutes.  Cool in pan for 10 minutes,
  then on cooling rack.
  
  LEMON CREAM:
  
  Steep saffron in lemon juice for 20 minutes.  Whisk eggs and sugar,
  then add juice.  Switch to non-wooden utensil and cook cream in top
  of double boiler until thick. Incorporate butter and cool before
  using.

 Categories: Cakes, Desserts, Sauces
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      2    9-inch layers of choc. Cake
      1    Fudge Icing (Recipe)
      1    Caramel Sauce (Recipe)
  1 1/2 c  Cashews, roasted, unsalted
      2 c  Heavy Cream
  2 1/2 lb Semisweet Chocolate
    1/3 c  Light Corn Syrup
      1 c  Brown Sugar, firmly packed
      2 ts Butter
    1/8 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Heavy Cream
 
  FOR CAKE:
     Slice round cake layers horizontally in half to make 4 round cake
  layers.  Place 1 layer on plate and top with Fudge Icing, Caramel
  Sauce and Cashews. Repeat with next 2 cake layers. Place final cake
  layer on top, frost top and sides of cake with Fudge Icing and cover
  sides of cake with chopped cashews. FUDGE ICING: Bring cream to boil.
  Stir in chocolate until melted and smooth. This will be very soft but
  will harden when cooled. Refrigerate until workable consistency.
  NOTE: The time it takes to get to a workable consistency depends on

  problem. CARAMEL SAUCE: Bring first 4 ingredients to boil and reduce
  to thick syrup. Very carefully, (because it will splatter), add

      Title: POVATICA BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
      1 c  Very warm water (105 F to
           -115F)
      2 pk Active dry yeast
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
    1/3 c  Instant nonfat dry milk (in
           -dry form)
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Lightly salted butter or
           -margarine, at room
           Temperature
  3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour (up to 4
           -cups)
           WALNUT FILLING
      2 tb Butter or margarine
      1 c  Firmly packed light brown
           -sugar
      4 c  Walnut meats, ground (1
           -pound)
      2 lg Eggs
      2 ts Ground cardamom seed or
           -cinnamon
      1 tb Vanilla extract
 
  Combine the water,yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand for 2
  minutes.  Add the dry milk, salt, butter, and 2 cups of the flour. Mix
  until smooth and beat for 2 minutes. Let rise, uncovered for 30 to 45
  minutes until bubbly.
  
  Stir in 1 cup of the remaining flour.  Turn the dough out onto a
  well-floured surface (using some of the remaining flour) and knead
  for 4 to 5 minutes, until smooth and elastic, adding only as much
  flour as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking.  The dough
  should be soft.
  
  Place the dough in a buttered bowl, turning once to bring the
  buttered side up.  Let rise in a warm place until double in volume,
  about 1 1/2 hours. Grease two
        9 x  5 x 3-inch loaf pans.
  
  Punch down the dough; turn out onto a lightly floured surface and cut
  in half.  Cover and let stand for 5 minutes. Roll out 1 piece of the
  dough to a rectangle 11 x 16 inches, stretching the dough and letting
  it stick to the surface as necessary.  Spread half of the Walnut
  Filling evenly over the dough to within 1 inch of the edges. Roll up
  the dough like a jelly roll, starting from a narrow side. Turn the
  edges under slightly and place the roll, seam down, in a prepared
  pan. Repeat with the remaining half of the dough. Cover and let rise
  for 1 hour or up to 1 1/2 hours. The dough may not swell to double in
  volume.
  
  Place the pans on a shelf near the top of an unheated oven and turn
  on the oven to 325F.  Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until done. Place
  the pans on a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes. Remove the loaves
  from the pans and let them cool completely.
  
  Makes two loaves.
  
  WALNUT FILLING:
  
  In a medium-sized saucepan, cook the butter and sugar over
  moderately-high heat.  When the butter and sugar have melted and the
  mixture is bubbly, remove the pan from the heat. Stir in the ground
  walnuts, eggs, cardamom, and vanilla.  Cool the filling before using.
  
  Makes about 3 cups of filling.

      Title: POZOLE
 Categories: Soups, Southwest, Holiday
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 lb Pork shoulder
           -(or shoulder chops),
           -with bones in
     29 oz White hominy (one
           -can), with packing juice
      6    Garlic cloves
      2 tb Chili powder
           -(or more to taste)
      2 ts Salt
 
  Put the pork shoulder piece(s) in a large kettle. Don't bother to cut
  them up.  Cover with cold water, about 10 cups. Slowly bring to a
  simmer, uncovered. As it simmers for the first 10 minutes or so, skim
  off any scum that rises to the surface.  (It will stop appearing
  after this.)
  
  Simmer, partially covered, for at least two hours. Don't let too much
  water boil away; just leave the lid a bit ajar so a small amount of
  steam can escape.
  
  Remove from heat.  Remove the pork pieces from the broth and cut the
  meat from the bones. Discard the bones. Cut the meat in medium chunks
  (whatever size is appropriate for stew) and return it to the broth.
  
  Crush or mince the garlic.  Add the hominy with its juice, garlic,
  chili powder and salt to the pork and broth. Adjust the chili powder
  to your taste. The estimate here is for a mild store-bought unblended
  spice and will produce a mild pozole. If you grind your own chiles,
  they may be hotter.  If you use a blend of chili powder and other
  spices (which is not recommended), you will probably want to reduce
  the salt. Remember that chili powder becomes mellowed and less spicy
  as it cooks.
  
  Return to heat and simmer (partially covered as before) for another
  two hours. By this time, some of the meat will still be in chunks,
  and some will be shredded. Skim the grease from the top; there may be
  quite a bit. Check for salt before serving. (Don't try to add
  anything else at the end; chili powder and garlic need time to cook.)
  
  I serve this with corn tortillas, wrapped in foil and warmed in the
  oven for ten or fifteen minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple New Mexican holiday stew -- This stew is from New Mexico.
  It is traditionally served on special days, such as Christmas Eve or
  New Year's Eve.
  
  *  An alternate way of cooking the stew is to simmer the pork for at
  least one hour, remove the bones and add the other ingredients as
  described above, and cook covered in a slow oven (275 (135 ) for
  several hours.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, 2 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

  The poster writes: The latest rage down here in the old south is the
  Bed and Breakfast in ante bellum homes, authentic and faux. It
  follows that the recipes developed by the maiden aunt who lived on
  the third floor and crept down to make her cookies in the middle of
  the night are the most sacred of documents, cherished and guarded,
  and exploited, and maybe even, heaven forfend, faked. There are
  several small bakeries born of the B and B who claim this cookie was
  developed by such a person, and is unique to that family. When I was
  a child, a looong time ago, this cookie was all the rage, and so
  easy!!
  
  HERE IS MY FAMILY'S SECRET  OOOOH What could it be? Lightly toast the
  pecans first.  Cool completely before adding to egg whites. This is
  sort of a meringue, but not really. It starts off crisp, and will
  stay that way depending on weather conditions. It gets chewy after
  awhile and is still delicious.

      2 ts Cumin seed; ground
      1 ts Mustard seeds

      2 lb Prawns; or large shrimp
           -peeled & deveined
    1/2 c  -Water
      1 ts -Salt
 
    Grind the garlic, chili, cumin seed, mustard seeds, peppercorns &
  tumeric together in a processor with 2 Tbsp of vinegar to act as a
  lubricant.
    Heat the oil in a pan and fry the onion paste over moderately low
  heat until light brown. Add the ground spices and continue to fry the
  mixture until it turns reddish, with a 'crumbled' look.
    Add the prawns & cook, stirring frequently for 10 minutes. Add the
  balance of the vinegar, the water and salt and continue to simmer,
  uncovered, for 5 minutes more. There will be very little sauce. Serve
  warm
  
  VARIATION: The prawn vindaloo can be prepared as a proper pickle,
  which means that it is a bottled (or refrigerated condiment) used now
  and then with other foods as an adjunct to the meat or fish dishes
  being served. Should you wish to prepare this as a pickle, follow the
  instructions, but omit the onions & and the water & cook the prawns
  separately in 2 Tbsp of oil before adding them to the mixture.

      Title: PRAWNS IN SPICE LADEN COCONUT SAUCE
 Categories: Indian, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     14 oz Canned coconut milk
      8    Dried, red chile peppers *
      2 ts Cumin seeds
      2 ts Coriander seeds
      1 ts Turmeric
      1 tb Grated fresh ginger
      6    Garlic cloves, minced
      5 tb Peanut oil
      1 lg Onion, thinly sliced
           Salt
      1 lb Prawns, shelled, deveined
 
  * seeded or partially seeded (reduce or increase amount for a milder
  or spicier flavor)
  
  Do yourself a favor and use canned coconut milk in this recipe. It's
  a heck of a lot easier and probably better than what you would
  produce using a fresh coconut.
  
  Process the grated fresh coconut or the desiccated coconut with 3 1/2
  cups hot water in a food processor. Drape a piece of folded
  cheesecloth over a bowl and pour the coconut mixture into the
  cheesecloth. Strain the liquid, squeezing the pulp to extract as much
  milk as possible. This is thick coconut milk; set aside.
  
  Pour 2 1/2 cups hot water over the coconut in the cheesecloth and
  squeeze to extract more milk into another bowl. This second extract
  is thin coconut milk.  Set aside.
  
  If you are using canned coconut milk, skip this step and proceed with
  the recipe.
  
  Grind the chile peppers, cumin and coriander seeds in a spice grinder
  and set aside.
  
  Process the thick coconut milk (or canned coconut milk) with the
  ground spices, turmeric, ginger and garlic; set aside.
  
  Heat the oil in a heavy, shallow pan.  Add the onions and cook until
  the edges begin to turn almost reddish brown (about 15 minutes),
  stirring frequently.  Add the coconut-spice mixture and cook until
  the liquid evaporates and oil separates from the paste.  Cook this
  paste for 10 more minutes, stirring constantly.
  
  Stir in the reserved thin coconut milk (or 2 cups water, if you have
  used canned coconut milk) and let simmer until reduced to a creamy
  sauce. Add salt to taste.
  
  Stir the prawns into the sauce and cook a few minutes until the
  prawns are just cooked.  (Be careful not to overcook). Serve with
  steamed rice.
  
  Grated fresh coconut:  Pierce the eyes of a fresh coconut and drain
  off the liquid.  Put the coconut in a preheated 375F oven for 20
  minutes. Break it open with a hammer and separate the meat from the
  hard shell in large pieces.  Break the pieces into smaller ones and,
  using a vegetable peeler, peel the brown skin off the meat. Grate the
  coconut meat in a food processor.
  
  Desiccated coconut:  May be found in Indian or Chinese stores.

  Clean, peel and chop into quarter-inch dice the peppers, onion and the
  okra. Heat the oil in a large pan and fry hr garlic with the onion,
  peppers and okra for about five minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook it
  gently for about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally until you have a
  nice bright sauce. It looks lovely as it is full of different colours.
  
  Season generously with allspice, cayenne pepper, the salt and the
  black pepper.
  
  Add thr prawns. If they are raw, cook for seven minutes. If they are
  already cooked and pink give them just three minutes to heat them
  through - otherwise you will end up with a pound of india rubber!

    1/2 c  Dry white wine, optional
           Salt and pepper, to taste
      3 c  Fresh spinach, julienned
 
  In the bowl of a food processor, combine butter, cilantro, ginger and
  garlic. Process until smooth. Add the juice of 3 limes and mix well.
  
  Saute bell peppers and prawns in the cilantro-butter mixture over
  medium heat. The wine may be added at this point. (It helps keep the
  butter from scorching and makes a smoother sauce.) Cook until prawns
  are pink and just barely done. Season with salt and pepper.
  
  Serve on 1/2 cup of julienned spinach for each serving, drizzling the
  butter over the top to wilt the spinach. Garnish with lime wedges.

      Title: PREPARING BUTTERS~ JAMS~ JELLIES~ & MARMALA
 Categories: Canning, Information
      Yield: 1 Guide
 
 
  METHODS OF MAKING JAMS AND JELLIES
  
  There are two basic methods of making jams and jellies. The standard
  method, which does not require added pectin, works best with fruits
  naturally high in pectin. The other method, which requires the use of
  commercial liquid or powdered pectin, is much quicker. The gelling
  ability of various pectins differs. To make uniformly gelled
  products, be sure to add the quantities of commercial pectins to
  specific fruits as instructed on each package. Overcooking may break
  down pectin and prevent proper gelling. When using either method,
  make one batch at a time, according to the recipe. Increasing the
  quantities often results in soft gels. Stir constantly while cooking
  to prevent, burning. Recipes are developed for specific jar sizes. If
  jellies are filled into larger jars, excessively soft products may
  result.

      Title: PREPARING CORNISH HENS
 Categories: How, Mine
      Yield: 1 Info
 
 
  BONING:
  
  Begin by trimming the wings with a sharp knife or poultry shears,
  cutting the wings at the second joint. Add the trimmings to the
  roasting pan or save them for stock. Next, prop up the bird so it's
  vertical, with its back toward you. With a sharp knife, cut through
  the skin and flesh along the entire length of one side of the spine.
  Flip the bird around and repeat on the other side of the spine.
  Remove the backbone. This can also be added to the roasting pan or
  saved for stock. Use the tip of the knife to remove the little
  wishbone at the neck end and spread open the bird with the inside
  facing you. Find the whitish triangle of cartilage at the tip of the
  breastbone and nick it with the knife. Now pick up the bird and bend
  it backward along the breastbone to crack it. Slide the tip of the
  knife or your finger under each side of the breastbone to loosen it,
  and then yank it out. Leave the ribs in place.
  
  STUFFING: To prepare for an under-the-skin stuffing, begin at the top
  of the breast and gently lift and pull the skin away from the flesh
  of the bird. Be very careful and very patient; game hen skin is
  delicate. Once you've separated the skin from the meat, use your
  fingers to gently force the stuffing between the meat and skin,
  pushing it back and around the breast and even down the thighs and
  legs, as you go. Try to keep the layer of stuffing s even as possible
  for a better shape and even cooking. Don't force too much under the
  skin (or fill the cavity with too much if you're using that method)
  since stuffing expands as it cooks.

      Title: PREPARING PICKLED & FERMENTED FOODS
 Categories: Canning, Information
      Yield: 1 Guide
 
 
  The many varieties of pickled and fermented foods are classified by
  ingredients and method of preparation.
  
  Regular dill pickles and sauerkraut are fermented and cured for about
  3 weeks. Refrigerator dills are fermented for about 1 week. During
  curing, colors and flavors change and acidity increases. Fresh-pack or
  quick-process pickles are not fermented; some are brined several
  hours or overnight, then drained and covered with vinegar and
  seasonings. Fruit pickles usually are prepared by heating fruit in a
  seasoned syrup acidified with either lemon juice or vinegar. Relishes
  are made from chopped fruits and vegetables that are cooked with
  seasonings and vinegar.
  
  Be sure to remove and discard a 1/16-inch slice from the blossom end
  of fresh cucumbers. Blossoms may contain an enzyme which causes
  excessive softening of pickles.
  
  Caution: The level of acidity in a pickled product is as important to
  its safety as it is to taste and texture.
  
  * Do not alter vinegar, food, or water proportions in a recipe or use
  a vinegar with unknown acidity.
  
  * Use only recipes with tested proportions of ingredients.
  
  * There must be a minimum, uniform level of acid throughout the mixed
  product to prevent the growth of botulinum bacteria.
  
  INGREDIENTS
  
  Select fresh, firm fruits or vegetables free of spoilage. Measure or
  weigh amounts carefully, because the proportion of fresh food to other
  ingredients will affect flavor and, in many instances, safety.
  
  Use canning or pickling salt. Noncaking material added to other salts
  may make the brine cloudy. Since flake salt varies in density, it is
  not recommended for making pickled and fermented foods. White
  granulated and brown sugars are most often used. Corn syrup and
  honey, unless called for in reliable recipes, may produce undesirable
  flavors. White distilled and cider vinegars of 5 percent acidity (50
  grain) are recommended. White vinegar is usually preferred when light
  color is desirable, as is the case with fruits and cauliflower.
  
  PICKLES WITH REDUCED SALT CONTENT
  
  In the making of fresh-pack pickles, cucumbers are acidified quickly
  with vinegar. Use only tested recipes formulated to produce the
  proper acidity. While these pickles may be prepared safely with
  reduced or no salt, their quality may be noticeably lower. Both
  texture and flavor may be slightly, but noticeably, different than
  expected. You may wish to make small quantities first to determine if
  you like them. However, the salt used in making fermented sauerkraut
  and brined pickles not only provides characteristic flavor but also
  is vital to safety and texture. In fermented foods, salt favors the
  growth of desirable bacteria while inhibiting the growth of others.
  Caution: Do not attempt to make sauerkraut or fermented pickles by
  cutting back on the salt required.
  
  FIRMING AGENTS
  
  Alum may be safely used to firm fermented pickles. However, it is
  unnecessary and is not included in the recipes in this publication.
  Alum does not improve the firmness of quick-process pickles. The
  calcium in lime definitely improves pickle firmness. Food-grade lime
  may be used as a lime-water solution for soaking fresh cucumbers 12
  to 24 hours before pickling them. Excess lime absorbed by the
  cucumbers must be removed to make safe pickles. To remove excess
  lime, drain the lime-water solution, rinse, and then resoak the
  cucumbers in fresh water for 1 hour. Repeat the rinsing and soaking
  steps two more times. To further improve pickle firmness, you may
  process cucumber pickles for 30 minutes in water at 180 degrees F.
  This process also prevents spoilage, but the water temperature should
  not fall below 180 degrees F. Use a candy or jelly thermometer to
  check the water temperature.
  
  PREVENTING SPOILAGE
  
  Pickle products are subject to spoilage from microorganisms,
  particularly yeasts and molds, as well as enzymes that may affect
  flavor, color and texture. Processing the pickles in a boiling-water
  canner will prevent both of these problems. Standard canning jars and
  self-sealing lids are recommended. Processing times and procedures
  will vary according to food acidity and the size of food pieces.

      Title: PREPARING SALAD GREENS
 Categories: Salads, Info
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  Start your salad with a good mix of your favorite greens. Place the
  greens in a sink full of cool water and remove any damaged leaves.
  Swish lightly to remove any dirt, then wait a few minutes while the
  dirt settles to the bottom.  Lift the greens into a salad spinner and
  spin dry, or shake them gently in a colander to remove excess water.
  Dressing won't stick to wet leaves, so take extra care to dry the
  greens -- transfer them to a dry tea towel, which you can then roll
  up and keep in the refrigerator until you're ready to make your salad.
  
  For longer storage of washed greens, place them loosely in a plastic
  bag with a few single sheets of paper towel to absorb extra moisture.
  Loosely tie the end of the bag.
  
  When you are ready to prepare the salad, tear the greens into
  bite-sized pieces and place them in the salad bowl. We prefer a
  wooden bowl and, like a cast-iron frying pan, keep it seasoned and
  try to avoid using soap to clean it.  We even make the dressing right
  in the bowl, adding the ingredients at the bottom with the greens on
  top, all to be tossed together just before serving.

      Title: PRESERVED DUCK EGGS (THOUSAND YEAR OLD EGGS)
 Categories: Eggs, Chinese
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2 c  Tea, very strong black
    1/3 c  Salt
      2 c  Ashes of pine wood
      2 c  Ashes of charcoal
      2 c  Fireplace ashes
      1 c  Lime*
     12    Duck egg, fresh
 
  *Available in garden stores and nurseries.
  
  Combine tea, salt, ashes and lime. Using about 1/2 cup per egg,
  thickly coat each egg completely with this clay-like mixture. Line a
  large crock with garden soil and carefully lay coated eggs on top.
  Cover with more soil and place crock in a cool dark place. Allow to
  cure for 100 days. To remove coating, scrape eggs and rinse under
  running water to clean thoroughly. Crack lightly and remove shells.
  The white of the egg will appear a grayish, translucent color and
  have a gelatinous texture. The yolk, when sliced, will be a
  grayish-green color.
  
  To serve, cut into wedges and serve with:
  
  Sweet pickled scallions or any sweet pickled vegetable
  
  Sauce of 2 tablespoons each vinegar, soy sauce and rice wine and 1
  tablespoon minced ginger root.
  
  Preserved Ancient Eggs
  
      These are often called thousand-year eggs, even though the
  preserving process lasts only 100 days. They may be purchased
  individually in Oriental markets.
  
      The description of the whites turning grayish isn't quite
  accurate from the ones I've seen. They're more a dark blackish amber
  color-- quite attractive actually.
  
      From "The Regional Cooking of China" by Margret Gin and Alfred E.
  Castle, 101 Productions, San Francisco, 1975.
  
      Incidentally, this is an excellent book. It's written by Maggie
  Gin of commercial Chinese sauce fame. If you can find an early
  edition, get it. The later editions have been integrated into her
  marketing strategies and may not be as complete as this one is. They
  also call for whatever the sauce ingredients are or "Maggie Gin's
  Such and Such Sauce".

 Categories: Poultry, Canned, Loo
      Yield: 1 Bird
 
      1    Large goose
           Salt
           Quatre epices OR
           Allspice OR
           Chinese 5-spice powder
           Ground thyme
           Ground bay leaves
 
  Cut the goose into serving pieces, saving the fat. Rub the pieces
  with salt and seasonings. Pack them in a big deep dish and cover with
  more salt. Leave in a cool place or the fridge for 24 hr.
  
  Render the fat in a big kettle. Escoffier says that if your goose is
  a good one, you should expect at least 3 lb 6 oz of fat from it!
  
  Next day, rinse and dry the goose pieces. Melt the rendered fat and
  drop the pieces in. They should be completely covered with fat. Cook
  over low heat 2 1/2 to 3 hr.
  
  Pack the goose pieces in a sterilized crock and pour the fat over.
  The fat should cover the pieces. Let the fat solidify and then pour
  over all 2 c of melted lard. When this is set, cover crock with a
  piece of butcher paper and tie it down or else put the lid of the
  crock on.
  
  This will keep a long time - it's best after at least a week. If you
  refrigerate it, or if you're using it within a day or two, you don't
  have to go through the melted lard and butcher paper routine. BTW,
  the lard is discarded, but the goose fat is kept for sauteing and
  other uses.

           Instructions:
 
  Pick leaves early in their growth period, that is early summer, when
  vines are covered with leaves.
  
  Choose leaves of medium light colour, not too young. If vines have
  been sprayed, wait for period recommended for general harvest by
  manufacturer of insecticide.  When picking, snip off stem.
  
  Wash leaves and stack in piles of 24, with shiny side up. Roll up and
  tie with string.
  
  Bring 8 cups water to the boil with 1/4 cup salt. Drop in 4 bundles
  at a time, return to the boil and blanch for 3 minutes, turning rolls
  over to blanch evenly. Lift out and drain. Repeat with remaining
  rolls.
  
  Make a brine with 8 cups water boiled with 1 cup rock salt.
  
  Pack rolls upright into warm sterilized jars and pour hot brine over
  leaves.  Remove air bubbles and seal when cold.
  
  Brine is sufficient for 20 bundles of leaves. Increase accordingly to
  quantity being preserved.

      Title: PRESERVED LEMONS
 Categories: Condiments, Moroccan, Fruits
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
      5 ea Lemons
    1/4 c  Salt, more if desired
      1 ea Cinnamon stick
      3 ea Cloves
           Coriander seeds, 5 to 6
           Black peppercorns, 3 to 4
      1 ea Bay leaf
           Freshly squeezed lemon juice
 
  If you wish to soften the peel, soak the lemons in lukewarm water for
  3 days, changing the water daily. Quarter the lemons from the top to
  within 1/2" of the bottom, sprinkle salt on the exposed flesh, then
  reshape the fruit. Place 1 tb. salt on the bottom of a sterilized
  one-pint mason jar. Pack in the lemons and push them down, adding
  more salt, and the optional spices, between layers.  Press the lemons
  down to release their juices and to make room for the remaining
  lemons. (If the juice released from the squashed fruit does not cover
  them, add freshly squeezed lemon juice - not chemically produced
  lemon juice and not water.*) Leave some air space before sealing the
  jar. Let the lemons ripen in a warm place, shaking the jar each day
  to distribute the salt and juice. Let ripen for 30 days. To use,
  rinse the lemons, as needed, under running water, removing and
  discarding the pulp, if desired - and there is no need to refrigerate
  after opening.  Preserved lemons will keep up to a year, and the
  pickling juice can be used two or three times over the course of a
  year.

  set it aside.
  
   Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add the onion, garlic, thyme, basil,
  celery seed, and sage. Saute until the onion is tender.
  
   Add the pressed tofu and saute, stirring occasionally, for 5-10
  minutes more. Add the tamari, tomato paste, nutritional yeast and
  water. Mix well.
  
   Use this mix in casseroles, spaghetti sauces, chili, pizza toppings,
  etc. This freezes well and can be used in any recipe calling for
  ground beef.

      Title: PRESSURE COOKER PORK CHOPS
 Categories: Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Pork chops (I prefer thick
           -ones)
           4-6 Potatoes, peeled and
           -sliced, somewhat thick
           -slices
    1/4 c  Water (approx)
      1    Onion, chopped
 
  Heat your pressure cooker on med-high and pour enough oil in to coat
  bottom.  Once hot, brown the pork chops until dark but not burned
  (this renders better gravy and I think they are tastier this way).
  Make sure to brown on all sides possible.  Remove chops to a plate
  and reduce heat to medium.  Add the sliced potatoes (beware the hot
  grease) and the water. Stir to coat the potatoes thoroughly. Add the
  onion (don't stir) and put the chops on top of all.  Sprinkle with
  salt and pepper if you like. Put the top on and when the cooker
  "bell" rocks, set your timer for 20 minutes. Cool the cooker down by
  running water over the top. Remove the chops to your serving plate
  and potatoes too. The chops will be very tender and the potatoes will
  be soaked in the gravy. Serves 4. This is not a real fast recipe
  because at medium heat, it takes a while for the pressure to build
  enough to rock that bell on your cooker. You can increase the heat
  but beware, you might burn those potatoes. My mother used to make
  this and it is one recipe I seem to have good success in duplicating.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Water & 2 tsp. salt OR
      1 c  Water & 1/2 C. sea water
      1    Packet Dry Yeast or 1 Tbls.
           -Dry Yeast
      1 tb Honey or sugar
      4 c  Flour (2 C. can be whole
           -wheat or other flour)
 
  Some notes on using a pressure cooker for baking: Method 1 - Uses the
  pressure cooker as the loaf pan. Grease inside of cooker well and
  sprinkle interior with cornmeal. If making sweet breads, omit the
  cornmeal. Method 2 ~ Uses the pressure cooker as an oven. YOU MUST
  REMOVE THE PRESSURE RELIEF PLUG AND RUBBER SEAL. The high
  temperatures will damage them.
  
  In all cases, a "flame tamer" should be used to prevent scorching.
  Unless specified, water should be lukewarm.
  
  Ships Bread - Method 1
  
  Combine water, yeast, and honey and let stand without stirring. When
  yeast has dissolved (about 5 minutes), stir and knead in flour. Let
  dough rise in warm place until doubled in bulk. Punch down and turn
  into the cooker. Allow to rise again until doubled. Bake over medium
  flame for about 45 minutes. You can turn the loaf over half way thru
  the baking to allow for more even browning.

      Title: PREVENTING PICKLING PROBLEMS
 Categories: Inform, Canfood, Pickling, Typed
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------PROBLEM PREVENTION--------------------------
 
  There are so many factors involved in pickling -- weather and growing
  conditions, type of salt, acidity of vinegar, storage temperature,
  time from gathering to pickling, processing -- that sometimes things
  go wrong. Here are some common problems and causes.
  
  1. SOFT OR SLIPPERY PICKLES: Could result from not removing the scum
  from the surface of the brine; from not keeping the cucumbers
  submerged in the brine; from using too weak of brine or vinegar,
  using hard water, or not removing the blossom end of a cucumber; from
  not sealing each jar as it is filled; from not heating long enough to
  destroy microorganisms; or from storing in too warm a spot. Check
  jars carefully for signs of spoilage.
  
  2. SHRIVELED PICKLES: May be the result of too strong brine, vinegar,
  syrup, or pickling solution, or may mean cucumbers didn't travel from
  the field to the kitchen fast enough.
  
  3. HOLLOW PICKLES: Could result from too long a time between pickling
  and processing, from improper curing or too high a temperature during
  fermentation, or from bad growing conditions. Don't use any cucumbers
  that float as you wash them.
  
  4. DARK PICKLES: Indicate iron in the water or cooking utensil, ground
  spices or whole spices left in jars, cooking too long with spices, or
  hard water.
  
  5. FADED, DULL  PICKLES: Result from poor growing conditions or too
  mature cucumbers.
  
  6. WHITE SEDIMENT IN THE BOTTOM OF JARS: It isn't harmful. It could
  come from not using pure granulated salt, or could be the result of
  fermentation. Check jars carefully for signs of spoilage.
  
  7. SPOILED PICKLES: Means you didn't process them properly; that you
  used old ingredients, nonstandard jars, or old lids; or that the
  pickling solution wasn't boiling hot, or you filled too many jars
  before sealing them. In other words, you didn't follow directions!
  Check jars carefully for signs of spoilage.

      Title: PRIK KAENG KIAO WAN  (GREEN CURRY-SWEET/HOT)
 Categories: Thai, Condiments
      Yield: 2 Cups
 
      1 c  Prik ki nu
           (green birdseye chilis)
      5 tb Lemon grass,
           Finely sliced
     10 tb Shallots (purple onions),
           Chopped
     10 tb Garlic, minced
      5 tb Galangal (kha) grated
      5 tb Coriander/cilantro root,
           Chopped
      2 tb Coriander seed
      1 tb Cumin seed
      1 tb Freshly ground
           Black pepper
      2 tb Shredded bai makroot
           (lime leaves)
      4 tb Kapi (fermented shrimp
           Paste)
      1 tb Palm sugar.
 
  This is a paste for a green curry, and the 'wan' indicates that it
  should be slightly sweet as well as hot. If you can't get prik ki nu,
  you can use half a pound of habanero chilis or one pound of jalapena
  chilis. If you use the latter deseed them before use. Note that if
  you use a substitute you will get a different volume of paste, and
  that you will need to use different amounts in subsequent recipes. If
  you can't get kha use ginger if you can't get bai makroot use lime
  zest if you can't get coriander root, use coriander leaves.
  
  coarsely chop the chilis. Toast the dry seeds in a heavy iron skillet
  or wok, and grind them coarsely. Add all the ingredients to a food
  processor and process to a smooth paste. Place in tightly stoppered
  jars, and keep in the fridge for at least a week for the flavors to
  combine and develop before use. The remaining three pastes are all
  made from dried red chilis: those sold in Thailand are frankly stale.
  Those sold in Europe and America are generally barely fit for human
  consumption. If you must use them then break them up and shake out
  the seeds, and soak them in tepid water for about 30 minutes before
  use. Preferably dry fresh red chilis. All these recipes call for one
  cup of fresh red chilis, or half a pound of red habaneros, or one
  pound of red jalapenas, deseeded. Dry them in the sun, or if the
  climate doesn't allow then dry them in a herb desicator, or smoke
  them in a smoker or over a barbeque. The dried chilis (which need not
  be tinder dry - it is enough to remove most of the water) are then
  toasted under a broiler until *almost* burnt. Treat this stage with
  extreme caution: if you overcook them a noxious gas closely related
  to Mustard gas is released. This is quite dangerous at a minimum cook
  them in a very well ventillated room with a fan on and have a damp
  cloth ready to cover your mouth and nose in case of emergencies --
  and disconnect your smoke detector/fire alarm! Thai 'curries' are
  typically made using a 'curry' paste. However that is an
  oversimplification: firstly the word used for these dishes in Thai is
  kaeng (pronounced 'gang') and it covers soups, stews and of course
  curries. A paste which is used could be used just as well for a soup
  as for a curry. Secondly of course it is not true that Thais call
  them curry: the word for curry is kari and it is only applied to a
  small number of dishes: the dishes that appear on western Thai
  restaurant menues as 'curries' are kaengs, and they are made not with
  curry paste but with a sauce made from prik kaeng (which in this case
  could be translated better as chili paste). There are many different
  prik kaeng in Thai cuisine and from them you could make a vast number
  of different dishes by using different protein ingredients, and
  vegetable ingredients and so on to the extent that it is said that
  most Thai housewives could cook a different kaeng every day of the
  year. However if you know the four basic pastes listed here, and the
  basic techniques from my next posting, you can make a vast array of
  dishes, if not perhaps quite one per day for a year. A rough rule of
  thumb is that one cup of raw chilis yields a cup or so of paste
  (since there is air in the chilis). Further it will keep about 3
  months in a preserving jar in the fridge. Since the average kaeng
  will require (depending on how hot you make it) between 2 and 8
  tablespoons of paste, and since there are roughly 16 tablespoons in a
  cup, you can scale this recipe up to suit your needs. Suffice it to
  say that we make these pastes on a cycle over 8 weeks and make 6-8
  portions of each of them. As they say in US motor advertisements:

      Title: PRIME RIB
 Categories: Beef, Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    4 Rib Standing Rib Roast
 
  Before you start preparing this recipe you need to know that it will
  create a considerable amount of smoke in your house during the early
  stages of preparation.  Preheat your oven to 500oF and verify with an
  oven thermometer that your temperature is correct. While oven is
  preheating let your prime rib stand at room temperature for at least
  1-1/2 hours, longer if possible to allow the inside of the roast to
  warm up as this will effect the cooking by this technique. Place the
  roast in a baking pan on a flat rack.  Place roast in the preheated
  500oF oven for 5 minutes per pound. ONCE YOU HAVE PLACED THE ROAST IN
  THE OVEN YOU MUST, MUST, MUST LEAVE THE OVEN DOOR CLOSED. DO NOT OPEN
  THE OVEN DOOR FOR ANYTHING. After cooking for 5 minutes per pound,
  turn off the oven. Continue to leave the OVEN DOOR CLOSED.  Let the
  roast set in the hot oven for 2 hours, with the DOOR CLOSED. The
  roast is ready to carve when it comes out of the oven since the
  juices have been reabsorbed while the roast has been setting in the
  oven. Carve and serve. Bon a Petite. From: Melinda Lee, KNX Food News

  When the roast is done scrape the browned drippings from the pan, add

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Salt
           Pepper
           Garlic powder
      1    Rib roast
 
  Preheat  oven at 500 degrees for a minimum of 20 minutes. Season the
  prime rib to taste (salt, pepper, garlic pow- der), put in preheated
  oven and roast for 5 minutes per pound. Turn oven off and leave roast
  in there for two hours.  DO NOT OPEN OVEN FOR ANY REASON, until the
  two hours are up. This makes a very rare, very juicy, prime rib with
  a crusty outside. (As I said,  this method applies  to any beef
  roast, but it must be AT LEAST 5 pounds.  2. (This is for a 4 rib
  roast). Bring roast to room temperature. Rub fat (not flesh) with
  salt and pepper. Stand roast on its bones, fatty side up, in a
  shallow roasting pan and put it in preheated 350 oven. Time it:
  calculate 17 minutes of cooking time per 1 lb. of roast that is to be
  well done on the outside and very rare inside--so that it can be
  allowed to stand for 15 min- utes out of the oven before it is
  carved. This gives the juices a chance to settle and makes carving
  easier. If you are using a meat thermometer, insert it so that the
  point is in the center of the meat, not touching the bone. For very
  rare meat, the internal temperature should read 125 degrees.
  Remember, the roast contin- ues to cook after it is taken out of the
  oven.

      Title: PRIME RIB (SYD)
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     12 lb Standing Rib Roast
 
  Many cooks think there is some special preparation for this popular
  restaurant meal but there really is nothing special in preparing
  prime rib. Many times your local grocery store will have standing rib
  roast on sale at lower prices than ground beef.  Preheat oven to
  325F. Place the roast on a rack in a 9-1/2" X 13" baking dish with
  the fat side up. Insert a meat thermometer into the fat side so the
  point of the thermometer is in the middle of the roast and not
  touching any bone or large pieces of fat. Bake the roast for 25
  minutes per pound or until the meat thermometer reads 165F.  The
  roast will be pink in the middle. That's all there is to making prime
  rib. If you have not tried this wonderful treat at home, I encourage
  you to do so.  It tastes even better at home than in the restaurant.

      Title: PRINZREGENT TORTE
 Categories: Cakes, Austrian
      Yield: 1 Cake
 
MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
      9 oz Butter, salted
      9 oz Sugar
    1/8 ts Vanilla extract
      4 lg Eggs, beaten
  1 2/3 c  Cake flour, about
           -(sift before measuring!!)
    1/2 c  Cornstarch
      1 ts Baking powder

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      2 c  Chocolate pudding
           -(extra strong)
      7 oz Butter, unsalted
  1 2/3 c  Powdered 10X sugar

MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
      1 oz Cocoa powder, bitter
      1 oz Butter (sweet), melted
      3 tb Water, boiling
           -(up to 4 T)
 
  In an electric mixer, whip the salted butter.  Add sugar, vanilla and
  eggs. Beat smooth.  Mix flour with cornstarch and baking powder and
  sift a second time (you sift it once before you measured it, right?).
  Add flour mixture to egg mixture, stirring constantly.
  
  Make 8 layers, each less than about 1/4 inch thick, by baking each in
  the bottom of an 8-inch springform layer pan. Do this by cutting a
  round of baker's parchment that exactly fits the bottom of the layer
  pan, then using a spatula to spread the dough evenly over the
  parchment. Make sure that it doesn't get too thin at the edges. Bake
  each layer for 7 minutes in a preheated 400 degree F. oven.  Stack
  the layers separated by waxed paper.
  
  MAKE THE PUDDING:  Use more chocolate in the pudding than you would
  normally use. If you want to be lazy and use pudding from a mix, then
  add about a tablespoon of top-quality cocoa to the pudding mix. Stir
  the pudding while it cools so that it does not congeal. Beat the
  unsalted butter until it is very smooth. When the butter and pudding
  are about the same temperature, add the pudding to the butter to get
  an even, smooth buttercream.
  
  Use the pudding/butter mixture as mortar, and layer the cake together,
  spreading the pudding/butter evenly between the layers. Make sure the
  layers are even and parallel; if they are not, or if one is not
  straight, you can mend things with a little extra pudding here and
  there. Do not put pudding on top of the topmost layer, and try not to
  get too much on the outside edges.
  
  MAKE A CHOCOLATE FROSTING:  Sift the powdered 10X sugar and cocoa
  together, add the melted butter while stirring constantly, then add
  boiling water. Frost the cake, taking pains to make sure the sides
  are perfectly smooth and the top is perfectly smooth. Let the cake
  sit at cool room temperature for at least an hour before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Austrian 8-layer chocolate cake -- I made this recipe for my
  boyfriend on his birthday and he asked me to marry him (I did). I'm
  not saying for sure that the Prinzregent Torte is why Don wanted to
  marry me, but I've always worried that it might have been. It is a
  magnificent recipe that always evokes incredulous cries of pleasure
  from people that I serve it to. The cake is a lot of work, so I only
  make it about once a year, but the people that I make it for feel
  very special. Yield: Serves 2-8.
  
  *  If you are not an experienced baker, you should be warned that in
  recipes like this it is important to measure exactly and to follow the
  instructions exactly. People who prefer to cook by testing, tasting,
  and adding more ingredients should avoid intricate baking.
  
  *  These layers are baked in the bottom of a springform pan. Such a
  pan bottom is about 8 inches in diameter, and has a raised lip that
  is about 1/8 inch high. It resembles a miniature pizza pan. I have
  never succeeded in making this torte with layers bigger than about 10
  inches; about 8 inches is easier. The baker's parchment is crucial
  and there is no good substitute, though buttered kraft paper (from
  shopping bags) will work in a pinch. Use a new piece of parchment for
  each layer. If you don't make the layers straight, then when you pile
  them up, the cake will be mounded up in the middle or will sag down
  in the middle or will tilt to one side.
  
  *  If you are not an experienced cake froster, then make double the
  recipe of frosting. Unskilled frosters usually use too much frosting,
  and you don't really want to run out. You can charge money to people
  who want to lick the spoon if there is any left over.
  
  Difficulty:  rather difficult;  Time:  1 hour; Precision: measure
  carefully.

    1/4 ts Black pepper
      2    -TO:
      3 c  -Water

MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Whole wheat pastry flour
    1/2 c  Wheat germ
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Margerine
      6 tb -Cold water
 
  Cut the tofu into 1/2" cubes.  Mix the flour, salt, pepper and garlic
  powder.  Add the tofu cubes and toss till coated. Saute in a large
  skillet with the 2 tablespoons oil. When tofu is golden and crisp,
  stir in the chopped onion.  Continue cooking 3 minutes, then add the
  carrots, celery, peas, and water. Cover the pan and cook over medium
  heat. Stir gently, every minute or so, till the carrots are just
  tender. Remove from heat and stir in:
  
  Melt margerine in a large saucepan, then add the sliced mushrooms.
  Cover pan and saute over medium heat till mushrooms are soft. Stir in
  flour and seasonings and cook over low heat 2 to 3 minutes. Whisk in
  water and simmer, uncovered, till gravy is thickened - about 10
  minutes. Mix half the gravy into the tofu and vegetables. Set
  remainder aside.
  
  For CRUST: Combine flour, wheat germ, and salt and stir to mix. Cut in
  margerine till mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Add cold water all
  at once and stir just enough to form dough into a ball. Divide in
  half and roll first half out on a floured surface.  Place in a
  10-inch pie plate. Roll out remaining half of dough and set aside.
  
  Spread tofu and vegetable mixture into the dough-lined dish (this was
  too much for my 9 inch casserole dish. Since it didn't fit, I reserved
  something like 1 1/2 to 2 cups as a topping for when it was cooked,
  as a sortof makeshift gravy.  Using a larger pan would probably work
  as well, if not better)..  Pour remaining gravy over top and cover
  with top crust. Fold edges of top and bottom crusts together and
  pinch to form edge. Cut 4 to 6 1-inch slits in top crust to allow
  steam to escape (my method is to just flatten pieces of dough and
  place over pie. Where the pieces overlap there is usually a gap of
  some sort for steam and juices to bubble through). Bake in a
  preheated 400 degree oven for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 350, and
  bake an additional 20 to 30 minutes, till crust is nicely browned.
  
  Hints: If there is way too much gravy for you to fit in your
  casserole pan, leave out the excess and serve over individual pieces
  as you serve it.

      Title: PROFESSIONAL RANGE TIPS (L A TIMES)
 Categories: Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Typed by Manny Rothstein
 
    Question: My friend has a new gourmet "professional" gas range with
  six special burners and boiler, grill, griddle, warming tray....Do
  these use more gas and heat up a kitchen more than an ordinary gas
  range?
  
    Answer: Even through these special professional gas ranges have many
  features and super-high-output burners, they actually can consume less
  energy overall than an ordinary gas range. With one of these ranges
  anyone can become a gourmet cook. They are commercial quality and
  should last a lifetime.
    Professional home-use "restaurant" ranges have burners with heat
  outputs as high as 15,000 BTU. The largest burners on ordinary ranges
  are only 9,000 BTU. When you are boiling water or cooking, the pot
  heats up faster with the higher output burners.
    This reduces the overall cooking time and the total amount of heat
  that is wasted and lost into your kitchen. When cooking or
  entertaining, your kitchen will stay more comfortable, especially in
  the summer.
    Professional ranges also have special burner designs and controls to
  provide more precise; and therfore, efficient cooking. One model has a
  multistage burner that varies the heat output from 14,000 BTU down to
  only 400 BTU. This is ideal for extremely delicate simmering.
    Other professional ranges use special star burners. Instead of a
  round burner flame on an ordinary burner, a star burner has eight
  fingers projecting from the center. There are many holes in the top
  of each finger, so the flame is in contact with the entire bottom of
  the pot for even cooking with no burning.
    Many professional ranges have six burners, built-in grills with lava
  rocks and griddles. The ovens are very large capacity, big enough to
  handle a commercial bun tray. Some models have the option of gas or
  electric ovens, or one of each. If you prefer an electric oven, you
  can get an optional convection oven which allows you to switch the
  fan on or off.
    Special infrared broilers produce evenly cooked juicy meats and
  seafood. Instead of just an open flame above the meat, the gas flows
  out into a large rectangular honeycomb box. As the gas burns in the
  hundreds of tiny holes, the entire honeycomb piece glows red and
  sears the meat perfectly. You can also get a super-hot 30,000 BTU
  accessory burner for wok cooking.
    Don't just go out and buy a commercial-grade restaurant range. They
  are not certified by the AGA for home use. Certified professional
  "home-use" ranges have child-proof knobs, cool air-wash oven doors,
  electronic ignition and insulated/multi-wall construction for
  zero-clearence against cabinets.
    You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 637 showing a
  buyer's guide for professional home-use gas ranges listing
  manufacturers, number of burners, burner heat output, design of
  burner and broiler, griddles, grills, convenience features and
  prices. Pleace include $1.50 and a self-addressed business size
  envelope. Send your requests to James Dulley, c/o Los Angeles Times,

  simmer, and let steam about 6 hours. **CHECK PERIODICALLY TO MAKE
  SURE WATER HASN'T BOILED OFF!
    Let the pudding cool in its container.  Store in a cool wine cellar
  or refrigerator.  It will keep for several months. Resteam the
  pudding approx. 2 hours before serving if you wish to flame it.
  Unmold onto a hot serving platter and decorate, if you wish, with
  sprigs of holly.
    Warm 1/2 c rum or bourbon whiskey.  Pour around the pudding &
  ignite. Serve with Zabaione Sauce, if desired.

      Title: PROFITEROLES
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter
    1/2 lb Semisweet chocolate
      1 c  Water
      2 tb Corn syrup
    2/3 c  Heavy cream
           PATE a CHOUX
    3/4 c  Water
    1/4 lb Butter
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Flour
      5    Eggs
           SWEETENED WHIPPED CREAM
  1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
      2 tb Sugar
    3/4 ts Vanilla extract
 
  CHOCOLATE SAUCE
  
  PREPARATION: For the Chocolate Sauce, chop the butter and chocolate
  into small pieces. Put the butter, chocoalte, water, and corn syrup
  in the top of a double boiler set over hot (not boiling) water. Stir
  occasionally until the chocolate is just melted. Remove from hot
  water and whisk in the cream.
  
  Chocolate Sauce can be made several days ahead.
  
  Line 2 baking pans with parchment paper or butter them and dust with
  flour.
  
  For the Pate a Choux, put the water, butter, and salt in a heavy
  saucepan over medium heat and bring just to a boil. Remove from heat.
  Add the flour and beat to combine. Return to medium-low heat,
  stirring constantly and vigerously, until the paste forms a ball and
  leaves a thin film on the bottom of the pan, about 5 minutes. Remove
  from heat and let cool a moment. Add 4 of the eggs, one at a time,
  beating thoroughly after each addition.
  
  Heat oven to 425F.  Beat the remaining egg with 1 tablespoon of water
  to make an egg wash.  Put the Pate a Choux in a pastry bag fitted
  with a 1/2-inch plain tip. Pipe 1-inch mounds onto the prepared pans,
  spacing them about 1 inch apart.  (Or use 2 spoons to form the
  mounds.) Lightly brush the tops with the egg wash and bake in
  preheated oven for 10 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 350 F and
  bake until lightly browned and all beads of moisture on the tops have
  evaporated, about 8 minutes longer. Cool on a rack in a dry place.
  
  Recipe can be made to this point a few hours ahead.
  
  Whip the heavy cream with the sugar and vanilla until just stiff. The
  cream can be whipped an hour ahead.
  
  SERVING;  Bring the chocolate sauce back to room temperature if
  refrigerated.  Put the whipped cream into a pastry bag fitted with a
  1/2 inch fluted tip. Cut the tops off the pastry puffs using a
  serrated or sharp paring knife.  Pipe or spoon in the whipped cream.
  Replace the tops. Pour some chocolate sauce onto each plate. Put the
  cream puffs on top of the sauce and serve at once.

  Season with salt and pepper. Lay 1 slice of prosciutto flat on your
  work surface with a long edge facing you. Place an arugula leaf and
  some daikon sprouts on the lefthand side of the prosciutto. They
  should stick out over the top edge of the prosciutto by about 1 inch.
  Lay 3 fig strips and a mushroom slice on the sprouts. Sprinkle with
  some of the balsamic vinaigrette and roll up the prosciutto into a
  cone. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Arrange the handrolls on
  a serving platter and serve at once. Serves 6. Note: To grill or
  broil portobello mushrooms, cut off and discard the stem, brush the
  cap all over with olive oil, and place on a grill over prepared coals
  or under a preheated broiler. Grill or broil the cap for 5 minutes on
  each side.

  whisk together vinegar, 2 tablespoons of the oil, salt, pepper, bay
  leaf, garlic, thyme, and orange peel. Add meat, cover bowl with
  plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 12 to 18 hours. Drain meat,
  reserving marinade. Pat meat dry with paper towels.
  
  2. In a Dutch oven or large skillet with lid, heat remaining 2
  tablespoons olive oil over moderately high heat. Brown meat well on
  all sides. Add wine and reserved marinade. Bring to a simmer and
  cook, uncovered, for 3 minutes. Reduce heat to maintain a bare
  simmer. Cover and cook until meat is meltingly tender (about 3
  hours). For best flavor, allow stew to cool to room temperature, then
  refrigerate, covered, overnight. Reheat gently to serve. Ladle stew
  into warm soup bowls, over buttered noodles, if desired, and garnish
  each serving with parsley.

           Diagonally
           Grated peel of one large
           Orange (colored part only)
      1 lg Orange, peeled and diced
      1    Loaf coarse-textured french
           Or Italian bread, cut into
           One inch cubes

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
           Mixed greens
 
  Grill or broil peppers until charred on all sides.  If using a
  broiler, line a baking sheet with a large piece of aluminum foil, big
  enough to hang over both ends of baking sheet. Place peppers in a
  single layer on top of foil.  Place about 6 inches below broiler
  element. Rotate to char all sides.  Remove from oven and enclose in
  foil for 5 minutes. Open foil and allow to rest until cool enough to
  handle. Remove skin, seeds and core.
  
  To remove pits from olives, press with side of a large-bladed knife:
  this will expose pit and it can be easily removed. Or use a cherry
  pitter.
  
  In a large bowl, combine all dressing ingredients and stir to
  combine. Add all remaining ingredients except bread and garnish;
  toss. Cover and marinate for at least 1 hour.
  
  Heat oven to 375 degrees.  Place bread in single layer on baking
  sheet or jelly roll pan.  Bake until golden. Cool. Add bread to olive
  mixture and toss.  Allow to sit for 10 minutes. Line platter with
  mixed greens. Mound olive salad in center.
  
  Note:  Olive mixture (without bread and garnish), can be stored in an
  airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      2 c  Good olive oil
      1 tb Black peppercorns
      3    Fresh bay leaves
      3    Dry chiles (i.e. japones),
           -including seeds
      3    Branches fresh thyme
 
  Bottles of olive oil containing red chiles, black pepper- corns and
  the wild herbs of the region sit on the table of every pizzeria in
  Provence. When the thin crusted pizzas come hot to the table, the
  first thing to do is sprinkle the hot pepper oil on them.
  
  Pour the olive oil into a clean, dry wine bottle, then add remaining
  ingredients. Cut 1/4-inch deep, V-shaped channel the length of a wine
  cork and use it to cork the bottle.
  
  Let stand in a cool, dark place for 2 to 3 weeks to let the oil become
  infused with the flavors. Stored in a cool, dark place the oil will
  keep several months.
  
  Uses: This is wonderful sprinkled on almost any pizza, from
  traditional ones such as quatre fromage or nouveau types such as goat
  cheese with scallops.
  
  Makes 2 cups.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      2 lb Flour
      1 qt Hot water (about)
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Brandy
      2 ts Vanilla
    1/2    Nutmeg; grated
      1 c  Raisins
      1    Lemon (grated peel)
    1/2 c  Tepid water
      6 ts Dried yeast
  1 1/2 qt Soy or other light oil
           -- for frying
 
  Place flour in large bowl (or on table) and into hole in middle, add
  gradually about a quart of hot water as you blend. Beating as you go,
  and sides are cleaned of batter, whip the batter thoroughly with the
  wooden spoon and add water until the mixture begins to ball. Continue
  whipping, as you gradually add the sugar, brandy, vanilla, nutmeg,
  raisins and lemon zest (grated peel).
  
  Lastly, blend in and whip 1/2 cup tepid water in which you let soak 6
  teaspoons of dried yeast as you begin the recipe. Let batter stand
  (about 15-20 minutes) while oil heats. Heat about 1 1/2 quarts soy
  oil, or other light cooking oil, in pan at ideal depth of 2 1/2
  inches. Whip the dough again.  Have teaspoon and cup warm water handy.
  
  When oil is hot enough (stops squeaking), take a small fistful of
  dough and squeeze upward a ball about double, filling the teaspoon
  that had been dipped in the warm water, then drop in hot oil.
  Continue, dipping spoon in water before scraping off the ball of
  dough, until your pan surface is nicely filled but not crowded. Take
  this opportunity to whip some more air into your dough.  You'll find
  from time to time they have to be coaxed to stay turned.  When both
  sides are golden brown, remove and let cool slightly before rolling
  in confectioners' (fine) sugar to coat. They're best on cold nights
  between sips of your favorite whiskey ("rakija").

      Title: PSARI SPETSIOTIKO - FISH~ SPETSAI STYLE
 Categories: Greek, Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      2 lb Fish
           -(snapper, porgy, mullet,
           -OR any favorite), cleaned
           -and left whole or sliced
           -into steaks
      1    Lemon; juiced
           Salt
    1/3 c  Olive oil
      4    Ripe tomatoes
           -(fresh or canned)
           - peeled and chopped
    1/4 c  White wine
           - (more if necessary)
      4    Garlic cloves; sliced
    1/2 ts Granulated sugar
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      1 c  Chopped fresh parsley
           Bread crumbs
           Tomato juice, if necessary
 
  Wash and dry the fish (if using dried cod be sure it was soaked
  overnight), then sprinkle with salt and lemon juice, particulary
  inside the neck area if using fish with heads on. Arrange on a
  baking-serving dish and set aside while you prepare the sauce.
  
  Heat the oil in a saucepan, add the tomatoes, wine, garlic, and sugar
  and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. (The amount of garlic may be
  reduced, but it *IS* the most important ingredient.) Season with salt
  and pepper.
  
  Sprinkle the fish with a light coating of bread crumbs and then with
  the chopped parsley, then spoon the hot sauce over the fish. Repeat
  the procedure until all the sauce has been used, ending with a
  topping of bread crumbs.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 30 to
  40 minutes, depending on the size of the fish, basting twice with the
  sauce. (A golden crust will form on the fish, characteristic of this
  famous style.) During the baking period, add some wie or tomato juice
  if necessary; some sauce should remain around the fish.  Serve hot.
  
  NOTE: This makes an excellent first course with dry white Demesticha
  or Samos wine.

      Yield: 1 Pint
 
    1/2 c  Onion, chopped
      2    Garlic, minced
      1 tb Olive oil
    1/2 c  Carrots, chopped
    1/8 c  Water
     12    Habaneros, stemmed but
           -not seeded, chopped
    1/2 c  White vinegar
    1/4 c  Lime juice
 
  Saute onions and garlic in oil over medium low heat until soft but not
  brown. Add carrots and water. Bring to boil, reduce to low and cook
  until carrots are cooked. Remove this mixture to a blender and blend
  along with the Habaneros. When smooth, mix in vinegar and lime juice
  and simmer briefly. If you are looking to use the sauce immediately,
  simmer for 5 min; if you are going to store it, 2 min will be
  sufficient but will increase the heat of the sauce to about Melinda's
  xxtra sauce heat. You may up to double the Habs before creating a
  painfully hot sauce (about as hot as Melinda's reserve) In any case,
  this stuff should be packed into sterilized containers for storage
  unless you want to drink it up all at once, heh heh.

      1 c  Oil
      1 c  Milk, more if necessary

      3    Or 4 eggs ( optional
           Egg wash: 1 egg/1 Tbs. milk
           Increase if needeed
 
  As you can see by previous Greek bread recipes, the Greek Housewives
  made plenty of bread. These recipes are directly from Greece and are
  in fairly large quantity.However this and other bread recipes can
  easily be halved for the smaller hosehold. All yeast breads freeze
  well too.
  
  Crumble yeast in the warm water and let dissolve. Beat the margarine
  until light and mix into the flour and yeast mixture. Then stir in
  the oil, sugar, salt, cinnamon, eggs if using ( a lighter baked good
  ) and the milk, adding " more if needed"  to produce a kneadable
  nonsticky dough. Knead smooth and elastic. Cover in a large bowl and
  let rise double. Punch down and let rise double again. Shape into 5
  loaves and place in pans. Beat egg and milk together and brush
  loaves. Slash top of each bread. Bake 400 for 15 minutes and then 375
  for 30 to 40 minutes or until golden and done. Recipe can be halved
  easily.

      Title: PUCCIA (OLIVE STUDDED ROLLS)
 Categories: Bakery, Italian, Breads
      Yield: 12 Lg. rolls
 
  1 1/4 ts Dried yeast
    1/3 c  Warm water
      3 c  Water at room temperature
      1 c  Biga Pugliese
  5 1/2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
      1 c  Whole-wheat flour
      1 tb Salt
  4 1/3 oz Small, meaty black olives in
           -- water or brine, pitted
           Cornmeal
 
  Stir the yeast into the warm water in a large bowl or heavy mixer. Let
  proof for 10 minutes.  Add the remaining water & the biga & mix until
  well blended. Add the flours & mix until the dough comes together, 1
  to 2 minutes, although it will not come away from the sides of the
  bowl. With very wet hands, knead until the dough is very silky, soft
  & elasticy. Knead on a lightly floured board to eliminate the
  stickiness. Knead in the olives by hand to ensure that they remain
  whole. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl & let rise, covered, until
  tripled, 3 to 4 hours. Pour the wet dough out of the bowl onto a
  floured work surface. Do not punch it down. Flour the top & divide
  into 12 pieces (or 16 if you want smaller rolls). Have a bowl of
  water handy to keep your hands very wet. Flatten each piece & roll it
  up lengthwise.  Pat them flat, turn the dough 90 degrees & roll them
  up again.  Shape each piece into a ball. Set on a floured baking
  sheet. Toss a hailstorm of flour over the tops & cover with a heavy
  cloth. Leave until doubled, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Preheat the oven to
  425F. Bake the rolls until they are crusty & golden, about 25 to 30
  minutes. VARIATIONS: Puccia di Grano Duro.  Substitute 7 1/2 c durum
  flour for the flours above. Knead the dough for an extra two minutes.
  Puccia di Uva Passa. Use raisins, softened in water for 30 minutes,
  in place of the olives. Pizzi. Add 1/4 ts to 3/8 ts hot pepper flakes
  to the vegetables of Cucuzzara (see recipe) & folding them into the
  dough in place of the olives.

  "Puchero is to Mexican cooking what Pot-au-Feu is to French. The
  difference lies in Puchero's imaginative combination of vegetables
  and fruits. Since it is even more delicious the second day, this
  recipe will make an ample amount to serve 8 for dinner, with some
  left over for lunch the following day."
  
  Place the chick peas in a kettle, cover with broth, and soak
  overnight.
  
  Cut the lamb and beef into 2-inch cubes, cut the chicken into serving
  pieces, and dice the ham.  Peel and slice the onion and garlic.
  Combine the drained chick peas, all the meats, the veal knuckle,
  onion, garlic, and salt in a large soup kettle.  Cover with 2 quarts
  of cold water and bring to a full boil.  Skim off the froth. Lower
  the heat, cover, and simmer for
       45    minutes.
  
  Cut the cabbage into eight wedges. Peel and slice the turnips and
  carrot. Slice the zucchini. Peel and dice the sweet potatoes. Cut the
  corn from the cob.  Add the cabbage, turnips, carrot, zucchini, sweet
  potatoes, and corn to the kettle. Cover and simmer about 20 minutes
  or until meats and vegetables are tender.
  
  Peel the boiled white potatoes and cut into thick slices. Peel
  bananas and cut into 2-inch slices. Saute potatoes, sprinkled with
  crushed coriander seeds and pepper in oil. Remove the potato slices
  with a slotted spoon. Keep warm.  In the same oil saute the bananas
  until golden. Keep warm with the potatoes.
  
  Peel, core, and slice the pears and peaches.  Put in a small pan with
  a little water and poach for 10 minutes. Do not overcook. Drain the
  fruit.

           -chorizo sausage
      2 tb Apple cider vinegar
      2 tb Brown sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Adobo juice from can of
           -chipotles
    1/2    Cinnamon stick
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
           Shredded roast pork or
           -chicken (see recipes)
      1    Ripe avocado, thinly sliced,
           -for garnish
      1    Red onion, sliced into
           -rings, for garnish
 
  Serve this as a stew with steamed white or brown rice. Accompany with
  avocado and onion slices. Tinga is also good served in warmed,
  scooped out French rolls or bolillos (Mexican rolls). You can add
  avocado slices, onion and a mild white cheese such as Jack to the
  sandwich. With a glass of icy beer and a salad, you have everything
  you need.
  
  Put tomatoes on a jelly-roll pan and place about 8 inch inches under a
  preheated broiler. Broil until tomato skins turn brownish, about 10
  minutes. Peel, cut in half horizontally and squeeze out seeds. Place
  tomatoes in a food processor along with garlic and chipotle chiles.
  Chop into a coarse puree.
  
  Heat olive oil in a skillet. Add onions and saute for 5 minutes until
  softened. Remove and set aside Using the same skillet, fry the chorizo
  until well cooked. If the sausage is fatty, drain on paper towels and
  wipe out skillet. Return the sausage and onion to skillet and add the
  tomato-chipotle mixture along with vinegar, sugar, salt, adobo juice
  and spices. Simmer for 20 minutes.
  
  Add the shredded pork or chicken, and simmer 20 to 25 minutes to blend
  flavors. If the mixture seems dry, add 1/2 cup broth or water.
  
  To Serve: Serve as a spicy stew with steamed rice. Or use as a
  filling for Mexican bolillos: Cut rolls in half and pull out some of
  the soft crumbs. Pile onion rings and avocado slices into the halves,
  then spoon on the tinga.
  
  Note: Chipotles are sold in 8-ounce cans labeled "chipotles
  adobados." They are found in Mexican grocery stores and in the ethnic
  sections of some supermarkets.

      Title: PUERTO RICAN BEEF PLANTAIN OMELETTE (PINON)
 Categories: Beef
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3    Plantains -- very ripe
           Oil -- for frying
      1    Onion -- chopped
    1/2    Green bell pepper --
           Chopped
      2    Cloves garlic
    1/2 lb Ground beef
    1/4 c  Tomato sauce
      1 tb Capers
      1 tb Green olives -- sliced
           Salt and pepper
    1/2 lb Green beans -- cut in 3-inch
           Pieces
      6    Eggs
    1/4 c  Butter
 
  Plantains are good sliced and sauteed. They're also good substituted
  into any recipe that uses cooked bananas. Many caribbean recipes that
  call for banana originally called for plantain, but the recipe-writer
  thought you wouldn't have access to plantain.
  
  The recipe is a little heavy in the fat department, so I usually
  leave out the meat, and skimp on the oil and butter. (I don't know
  how authentic the veggie version is!) Also, the author wants us to
  boil the beans to death. I have taken the liberty of changing that in
  the body of the recipe.
  
  Use fresh or frozen green beans.
  
  Peel the plantains, cut into 2-inch thick legthwise slices, and fry
  in oil till golden brown. Remove, drain, and keep warm.
  
  In a frying pan, saute the onion, green pepper, and garlic until soft
  but not brown. Add the ground beef and fry at high heat for 3
  minutes. Pour in the tomato sauce and add the capers and olives, if
  desired. Cook 15 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally.
  Season with salt and pepper to taste. Wash the string beans and steam
  till tender.
  
  Beat the eggs, adding salt and pepper to taste. Butter the sides and
  bottom of a round casserole and melt the remaining butter in the
  bottom.
  
  Pour in *half* of the beaten eggs and cook over medium heat for about
  1 minute or until slightly set. Cover the eggs with one-third of the
  plantain slices, following with layers of half the ground meat and
  half the string beans. Add another layer of plantains, the remainder
  of the ground beef, another layer of beans, and top with plantains.
  Pour the rest of the beaten eggs over the top.
  
  Cook over low heat for 15 minutes, uncovered, being careful not to
  let the omelette burn. Then place in a preheated 350-degree oven for
  10 to 15 minutes to brown the top of the pin~on. Serve with rice and
  beans.
  
  Excellent for lunch.

  I love Puerto Rican Food!... It's usually simple, yet rich with lots
  of cilantro and garlic!!.  Enclosed are examples of 4 dishes that can
  be simplified to taste. I always add mucho mas cilantro, peppers and
  garlic with fresh ingredients (I never used canned foods).
  
  I prefer to also add a pinch of red chili powder just to make it
  interesting (not a traditional ingredient in Puerto Rican food).
  
  In a large heavy kettle, brown meat in oil.
  
  Add green pepper, sweet chili, onions, cloves, cilantro, vinegar (or
  lime juice), oregano, tomato sauce, bay leaves, and salt. Mix and
  bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 1 hour.
  
  Add carrots to kettle.  Drain liquid from peas into kettle and mix
  (reserve peas)   Bring rapidly to a boil, reduce to low, cover and
  cook about 1 hr until meat is almost fork-tender..
  
  Add potatoes, olives, capers, raisins, and 1/2 tsp salt, bring
  rapidly to a boil,  reduce heat to low, cover and cook about 1 hour,
  or until meat is fork-tender and  vegetables are done.
  
  Ad reserved peas and mix.  Taste and adjust seasoning (uncover, and
  boil to thicken sauce to taste).

      Title: PUFF PASTRY
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 c  All-purpose flour
      1 c  Plain bleached cake flour
  6 1/2    Sticks chilled sweet butter
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Iced water (approximately)
 
  Makes about 2 3/4 lbs dough, making a 36- by 12-inch rectangle 1/4"
  thick.
  
  To measure flours, scoop dry measure cups into a container and sweep
  off excess with the flat edge of a knife. Rapidly cut the butter into
  big dice; toss butter and flour together on your work surface. Mixing
  it rapidly with the flour, flatten the chilled butter into lima-bean
  size. Do it by hand or in an electric mixer with a flat beater. (A
  food processor cuts butter too small.)  If butter has softened, chill
  everything 20 minutes. Blend in 3/4 cup of iced water, lifting and
  turning, adding droplets more until mixture holds together.  A mess!
  Push, pat and roll dough into a rough rectangle; flour the top
  lightly as necessary. If it breaks too much, sprinkle on drops of
  water. It will look quite awful. When the rectangle is 18" long, flip
  one end over onto the middle, then the other end, like folding a
  letter, making 3 layers. Scrape and flour work surface. Turn dough so
  top flap opens on your right.  Push, pat and roll it again into a
  rectangle. Clean rolling pin and flour it lightly; if dough softens,
  refrigerate at once.  Again fold the dough into 3; use a pastry sheet
  to help. Again roll it out into a rectangle.  To prevent it from
  sticking, keep dough floured, work surface clean. These rolls and
  folding into 3 layers are known as "turns" -- you now have made 3
  turns. Make the fourth turn, shoring up the edges with side of
  rolling pin. By this time, you have a real dough. Wrap and
  refrigerate for 45 minutes at least-- to relax it. Complete the fifth
  and sixth turns and it is ready to roll out and form.

      Title: PUFF PASTRY (PATE FEUILLETEE)
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 lb All-purpose or unbleached
           -flour, very accurately
           Weighed
      1 lb (4 sticks) cold unsalted
           -butter, cut into small
           Pieces
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Heavy cream (or 1/2 cup
           -heavy cream mixed with 1/2
           Cup ice water)
 
  Makes about 2 pounds
  
  In the bowl of a food processor or using the flat paddle of an
  electric mixer, mix 1/2 cup flour with the butter until very smooth.
  Shape the mixture into a flat square 1 inch thick, wrap well in
  plastic, and chill for at least 30 minutes.
  
  Combine the salt with the remaining flour in a large mixing bowl and
  add the cream.  Mix the dough well by hand or with an electric mixer;
  the dough will not be completely smooth but it should not be sticky.
  Shape it into a flat square 1 1/2 inches thick, wrap in plastic, and
  chill, at least 30 minutes.
  
  Remove the dough from the refrigerator and, on a lightly floured
  board, roll the dough into a rectangle twice as long as the butter
  dough. Place the butter dough in the center, fold up the ends to
  completely encase the butter dough, and seal the edges by pinching
  them together. Wrap well in plastic and chill for at least 30
  minutes, so that the dough achieves the same temperature throughout.
  
  Remove the dough from the refrigerator and, on a lightly floured
  board, roll it out into a large rectangle approximately 1/2 inch
  thick. Fold the dough into thirds, aligning the edges carefully and
  brushing off any excess flour.  The object is to ensure that the
  butter is distributed evenly throughout so that the pastry will puff
  evenly when baked. Wrap the dough and chill it for at least 30
  minutes. This completes one turn.
  
  Repeat this process five more times; classic puff pastry gets six
  turns, creating hundreds of layers of butter between layers of the
  flour dough (729 to be exact). Use as little flour as possible when
  rolling out the dough, and always brush off any excess.  (I use a
  4-inch brush for this.) Remember to let the dough rest for at least
  30 minutes in the refrigerator between turns, or 15 minutes in the
  freezer.  This chilling makes the rolling out much easier and it
  keeps the layers of butter of equal thickness.
  
  By the sixth and final turn, the dough should be very smooth, with no
  lumps of butter visible.  Wrap the pastry in plastic wrap and
  refrigerate until ready to use (up to 2 days), or freeze for future
  use. I usually divide the dough into 1-pound pieces and freeze it
  that way.
  
  RECTANGULAR TART SHELLS:  Roll out the pastry into a rectangle at
  least 20 inches long and about 1/8 inch thick. Using a ruler as your
  guide, cut the edges with a sharp knife so that the pastry measures
  the desired size (I generally make these 4 X 18 inches). From the
  remaining pastry, cut three strips 1/2 inch wide and as long as the
  tart.
  
  Place the rectangle on a parchment-lined or water-sprayed baking
  sheet. Build up the edges by pasting two strips on the long edges
  with water. Cut the third strip into two strips that will fit the
  shorter edges and attach with a bit of cold water, overlapping the
  ends. Prick the entire inside bottom of the pastry shell with the
  tines of a fork (this prevents uneven puffing).  Carefully line only
  the bottom with aluminum foil, and weight with beans, rice, or
  aluminum or ceramic weights. (Be careful not to weight the edges.)
  Refrigerate, covered, for at least 30 minutes.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 F.  Remove the pastry from the refrigerator
  and brush the uncovered edges with a glaze of 1 egg yolk mixed with 2
  tsp cream or water. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the edges
  have puffed and begun to brown.  Remove the weights and foil, and
  continue to bake until the entire shell is light golden brown. Let
  cool completely on a wire rack.

 Categories: Breads, Italian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Water
  1 1/4 ts Yeast
  13/16 c  Starter (Biga)
  2 1/4 c  Water
      1 tb Salt
      1 ts Salt
  7 1/2 c  Flour
 
  Mix water and yeast together.  Let stand for 10 mins. Add Biga
  (starter) and water.  Mix until creamy looking. It is not necessary
  to get rid of strands of starter that occur.
  
  Add all of the salt.  Stir until desolved.
  
  Add flour. Mix 2-3 minutes (electric mixer) or mix 4-5 minutes (by
  hand).
  
  Dough will just barely pull away from sides of bowl. It should be very
  sticky. Adjust water and/or flour as necessary.
  
  Let rise in a lightly oiled bowl for 3+ hours, covered tightly with
  lightly oiled plastic wrap. Dough will triple in volume.
  
  Divide dough into four parts.
  
  Roll each part into long strand.  Roll up along length, stretching
  slightly. Turn dough sideways and roll to long string again. Roll up
  into tight ball, tucking to ends under.
  
  Let rise 1 hour, covered with towel.
  
  Pre-heat oven to 450, with pan of water in the oven, about 20 minutes
  before baking.
  
  Lightly dust loaves with flour and place on flat cookie sheet.
  
  Caution:  The oven will be steamy when opened.
  
  Bake with pan of water for 15 minutes. Remove water pan.
  
  Bake 20 more minutes. Loaf should sound hollow on bottom. On of the
  best ways to eat this bread is by rubbing a slice with garlic, or
  sprinkling with crushed fresh garlic or garlic powder. Then drizzle
  virgin olive oil over the bread. Follow this with a light sprinkle of
  Parmesan cheese.
  
  Bread dough can be wrapped in plastic at any of the stages before
  baking and frozen or refrigerated. Unfreeze and allow to thaw
  completely. This seems to work best if done before the rolling of the
  individual loaves.
  
  If stored in refrigerator, allow ample room, as bread will rise in the
  refrigerator!

  stirring occasionally, until it begins to brown. Peel and cube
  pumpkin to about 1" pieces. Add pieces to skillet as you prepare it.
  Stir to coat with butter.

  Yield: 6 to 8 servings.
  
  Fritschner writes: "In the pumpkin and apricot dish..., the natural
  sweetness of pumpkin, dried apricots and onion all play off each
  other to make a subtle side dish. The original recipe came from Sonia
  Uvezian's _Cooking from the Caucasus_, which has several recipes
  using pumpkin as a savory side dish or addition to a main dish. It
  isn't quick to prepare, but it's delicious."

 Categories: Soups, Vegetables
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3 tb Butter or corn oil
      1    Large onion, chopped
      1 tb Tamari/shoyu soy sauce
      1    Ripe tomato, diced
      4 c  Chicken or vegetable stock
      4 c  Fresh pumpkin puree OR
      4 c  Fresh butternut puree OR
      4 c  Canned pumpkin puree
      1 tb Maple syrup or honey
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1    Bunch broccoli
    1/4 c  (to 1/2c) whipping cream
 
  Cut the tops of the broccoli into small flowerets; julienne the stems
  into strips roughly 1/4 x 1 inch. 
  1.  In a 10-inch skillet, melt the butter or heat the oil over
  medium-low heat.  Add the onion and saute slowly until almost limp
  but not brown, about 6 to 7 minutes. Add the tamari/shoyu soy sauce
  and the tomato. Cook, stirring often, until the tomato's juice has
  evaporated, about 5 minutes.
  2.  Transfer the saute to a soup pot.  Deglaze the saute pan with a
  little of the stock, and add the pan contents, plus the remainder of
  the stock, to the soup pot. Add the pumpkin or squash puree, the
  maple syrup or honey, salt, and a touch of freshly ground black
  pepper. Heat, stirring often.
  3.  Separately, in a small pot with a tightly fitting lid, steam the
  broccoli flowerets and stems until tender-crisp (they should be a

  Stir the steamed broccoli into the soup, then stir in the cream. Let
  the soup cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until hot and the
  flavors have blended, 8-10 minutes.

      1 tb Bitters, optional
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts Ground ginger
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
      1 ea Egg,slightly beaten
      2 tb Butter
      1 cn Pumpkin puree (29 oz)
      1 cn Evaporated milk 12 oz
    1/4 c  Sweet milk
      1 c  Water

MMMMM--------------------------PRALINE-------------------------------
      4 tb Butter, softened
    2/3 c  Light brown sugar
    2/3 c  Pecans, coarsely chopped
      1 x  Whipped cream or whipped top
 
   TO MAKE HOT WATER DOUGH: Beat lard or shortening and salt in a large
  bowl; gradually, beat in boiling water. Cool to room temperature,
  stirring, occasionally to prevent water and lard from separating.
   Beat in 2 cups flour, then form dough into 2 balls. Flatten each
  portion into a 6" disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill. (If desired
  refrigerate overnight or freeze up to 1 month.) TO MAKE PUMPKIN
  FILLING: Mix sugar, light brown sugar, flour, bitters, if desired,
  cinnamon, ginger, salt, nutmeg and cloves in a large bowl. Stir in
  egg; set aside. Melt butter in a large skillet over low heat. Add
  pumpkin puree; simmer, stirring occasionally, until puree thickens
  slightly, about 10 minutes. Gradually, stir hot pumpkin puree into
  the sugar mixture. Stir in evaporated milk, sweet milk and 1 cup
  water.(If desired, cover and refrigerate overnight.) TO MAKE PRALINE:
  Beat butter and brown sugar in a medium bowl. Stir in pecans and set
  aside. (If desired,cover and refrigerate overnight.) ASSEMBLE AND
  BAKE: Bring chilled dough to room temperature. Working with one disk
  at a time, place on a floured surface. Using half of the remaining
  1/4 cup flour, roll into a 13" circle, 1/8" thick.
   Transfer and fit dough into a 9" deep dish pie pan; trim away excess
  dough and flute the edges with a fork. Repeat with remaining disk of
  dough to make a second pie shell. Prick each pie shell all over its
  surface with a fork. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Freeze pie shells
  for 10 minutes. Spread half of the praline mixture over the bottom of
  each pie shell. Bake until praline is golden brown and bubbly, about
  10 minutes; cool slightly. Reduce oven temperature to
      400    degrees.
   Pour half the pumpkin filling into each crust; smooth the top of
  each with a spatula. Bake until pumpkin filling in each pie pan is
  firm and crusts are golden brown, about 1 hour. Cool completely and
  serve.
   Makes 2 - 9" pies. Top with whipping cream or whipped topping, if
  desired. Garnish with whole pecans.

      Title: PUMPKIN & RAISIN BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------1 1/2 POUND LOAF---------------------------
      4 ts Red Star Active Dry Yeast
      3 c  Bread flour + 3 ts ***(See
           Note below)
      3 tb Wheat germ
      3 tb Powdered milk
      3 tb Gluten
      4 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Ground ginger
    3/4 ts Ground cinnamon
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Canned pumpkin
    2/3 c  Water
      3 tb Butter or margarine
    1/2 c  Raisins
 
  I have a Hitachi 101, and this recipe has been successful. It makes a
  7 inch tall loaf.  This is a soft fluffy loaf.
  
  Other bread machines will have to alter to manufacturers guidelines.
  
  Have all ingredients at room temperature.
  
  Mix the pumpkin, water and butter in glass mixing cup. Microwave on
  high for approx. 60 seconds.  Test to make sure the liquid is warm to
  the touch. Because the pumpkin is very dense, it may have to be
  zapped a bit longer. If liquid gets too warm, pour into machine bread
  pan and stir with rubber spatula so the coolness of the pan can cool
  down the liquid.
  
  Add ingredients to bread pan according to manufacturers directions.
  
  About 5 minutes into the mixing cycle check to see if the dough is too
  sticky - if so you may have to add additional flour, one teaspoon at a
  time.  After the rest cycle, and the kneading starts up again, check
  again for texture.  This dough usually runs a*little*bit sticky.
  Start adding the raisins about 12 minutes into the cycle. (Adding
  them at the beeper on my machine sometimes makes the raisins gather
  at the bottom of the pan and they refuse to blend into the dough).
  
  Bake on "mix bread" cycle, with Light Crust setting.
  
  *** Depending on humidity more flour may be needed 1 teaspoon at a
  time.
      (see above)
  
  I have not tried this on a delayed timer, or on rapid rise.
  
  The end result is a bread that tastes like pumpkin pie and raisins.

MMMMM----------------------------CAKE---------------------------------
    1/2 c  Butter
      1 c  Firmly packed brown sugar
      2    Eggs
    3/4 c  Pumpkin; sieved and cooked
           Or winter squash
      2 c  Cake flour; sifted
    1/2 ts Baking soda
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
    1/2 ts Allspice
    1/2 ts Ginger
    1/2 c  Buttermilk or sour milk
           (or stir 1 1/2 tsp vinegar
           -into 1/2 cup sweet milk and
           -allow to stand 10 minutes)
    1/2 c  Nuts; chopped and toasted
           -(walnuts, pecans, filberts)

MMMMM----------------------CARAMEL FROSTING---------------------------
      2 c  Dark brown sugar; firmly
           -packed
  1 1/3 c  Light cream
      3 tb Butter
    1/8 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Vanilla
 
  In a mixing bowl, cream the butter well, then cream in the sugar until
  fluffy.  Beat in the eggs and the pumpkin. Sift the dry ingredients
  together and stir in alternately with the milk. If using an electric
  mixer, add the dry ingredients and milk and turn to lowest speed;
  push down the batter from the sides of the bowl with a rubber
  spatula, and mix just until the batter is smooth. Add the nuts and
  turn into a greased and floured sheet cake pan 11x14x2 inches or two
  8 or 9-inch layer cake pans, greased and floured. Bake in a preheated
  350 degree F. oven about 35 minutes for a sheet cake or 25 for
  layers, or until the cake springs back when pressed lightly in the
  center. Cool 5 minutes on a rack, loosen from the pan, and turn out
  onto the rack to cool. Frost with Caramel Frosting.
  
  FROSTING: In a saucepan over low heat, bring the sugar and cream to a
  boil. Cover the pan and cook the mixture 3 minutes. Remove the cover
  and continue cooking until the mixture reaches 236 to 240 degrees.
  Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter, salt, and
  vanilla. Cool to lukewarm, then beat until the mixture is creamy
  smooth and of spreading consistency. This recipe provides sufficient
  frosting for a 9-inch two-layer cake or the equivalent. Source: James

 Categories: Breads, Fruits
      Yield: 2 Dozen
 
    1/2 c  Hot milk
      2 tb Butter
      3 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Pureed pumpkin or winter
           - squash
      1 ts Salt
  3 1/4 c  All purpose flour
      1 tb Active dry yeast
    1/4 c  Warm water
 
  Combine hot milk, butter, sugar, pumpkin, salt and 1/4 cup flour in a
  large bowl. Stir yeast into 1/4 cup warm water and let stand for 5
  minutes or until bubbly.  Add yeast to the first mixture and beat
  vigorously. Cover and leave in a warm place to rise for 30 minutes or
  until light. Stir in 2-3 cups flour until dough leaves sides of bowl.
  Turn out onto a floured surface and knead in flour until dough is
  smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl,
  turning it to grease the top. Cover and place in a warm draft-free
  place until doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Punch dough down, and
  turn out onto a lightly floured board. Roll dough with a rolling pin
  to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into 2 inch rounds. Place rounds about 1
  inch apart on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise for 20
  minutes or until almost double in size. Bake in a preheated 400 F.
  oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown. HINT: Place bottom
  pan on top oven rack and top pan on bottom oven rack after first six
  minutes of baking to ensure even brownness. Baker's note: This recipe
  rates four stars.  It has a wonderful flavour, and a nice golden
  brown colour. It would be good to serve at Thanksgiving dinner.

      Title: PUMPKIN BISCUITS (LACTO)
 Categories: Digest, Nov.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Canned pumpkin (NOT pie
           Filling)
    2/3 c  Skim milk or other form of
           Liquid
  1 1/2 c  Flour (half white, half WW)
      2 tb Wheat germ
      2 tb Wheat bran
      4 ts Baking powder
      1    Clove garlic, minced
      1 pn Nutmeg
      1 ts Salt (optional)
 
  Combine wet, combine dry, mix wet into dry, drop by generous
  spoonfuls onto baking sheet squirted with PAM. Bake 20-30 minutes at
  450 degrees.
  
  The garlic doesn't really give these a pronounced garlic flavor--it
  just eliminates some of the cloying sweetness of the pumpkin. When
  these first come out of the oven they are very crisp on the outside
  and dense and moist on the inside--sort of like little
  mini-spoonbreads. After they cook the texture becomes more uniform
  and more like the standard biscuit we all know and love.

 Categories: Fruits, Breads, Puddings, Desserts
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      4    Eggs
      3 c  Whole milk
      1 lb Mashed pumpkin
      1 c  Brown sugar
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Vanilla
  1 1/2 qt Torn bread pieces
      1 c  Dark raisins
           Boubon Sauce:
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter
      1    Egg
      1 c  Sugar
      2 tb Whole milk
    1/2 c  Bourbon
 
  PUDDING: Beat eggs in a large bowl. Add milk and beat again. Stir in
  pumpkin, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and vanilla. Add bread pieces
  and press with your hands to submerge bread in the milk mixture. (If
  you have the time, cover and refrigerate the mixture several hours or
  overnight; break up the bread the next day and bake as directed; if
  not, proceed as follows.) Set the mixture aside for 15 minutes. Use
  your fingers to break up the chunks of bread. Set aside 15 minutes
  and repeat. Add raisins. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Generously butter
  a 2 quart baking dish. Fill the dish with bread pudding mixture and
  bake for 1 hour, or until pudding is set. Serve warm, hot or cold
  with hot bourbon sauce. BOUBON SAUCE: Use unsalted real butter for
  the best bourbon sauce; margerine doesn't make a great sauce. Melt
  butter in a bowl set over hot but not boiling water. Combine egg,
  sugar and milk in a small bowl and beat until light colored. Add to
  butter and beat with a whisk over hot water until sugar dissolves -
  at least 5 minutes. Add boubon and stir. Remove from stove and serve.

 Categories: Desserts, Vegetables, Holiday
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      3 c  Sifted cake flour (sifted
           -before measuring)
      3 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Cinnamon, ground
    1/4 ts Cloves, ground
      1 c  Cooked or canned pumpkin
    1/2 c  Milk
      1 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Light-brown sugar,packed
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine,
           -softened
      2    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour three 8-by-1
  1/2-inch layer-cake pans. Sift flour onto waxed paper with baking
  powder, soda salt, cinnamon, cloves. 2. In a 2-cup measuring cup,
  combine pumpkin and milk, mixing well. Turn granulated and brown
  sugars, butter, eggs and vanilla extract into large bowl of electric
  mixer; beat at high speed about 5 minutes, occasionally
  
  scraping side of bowl with rubber scraper. 3. At low speed, beat in
  flour mixture (in fourths) alternately with pumpkin mixture (in
  thirds). Beat just until smooth-1 minute. Pour batter into pans; bake
  30 to 35 minutes, or until surface springs back when gently pressed
  with fingertip. Cool in the pans 10 minutes. 4. Remove from pans;
  cool completely on wire rack. Make Frosting: In top of double boiler,
  combine 1/4 cup egg whites, 1 1/2 cups light-brown sugar, packed, 1
  tablespoon light corn syrup and 1/3 cup water. With an electric
  rotary beater, beat 1 minute to combine. 5. Cook over rapidly boiling
  water, beating constantly, about 7 minutes, or until stiff peaks form
  when beater is slowly raised. Remove from boiling water. Add 1
  teaspoon vanilla extract; then continue beating until the frosting is
  thick enough to spread-about 2 minutes. 6. Place a layer on plate,
  top side down; spread with 1 cup frosting; sprinkle with 1/2 cup
  chopped walnuts. Repeat with second layer, top side down. Frost cake
  with rest swirling decoratively. Garnish edge with walnut halves.
  Refrigerate till serving. Serves 12

      Title: PUMPKIN CHEESE SOUP
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Pumpkin (big enough
           -to hold 6-10
           -servings of soup)
      2 tb Butter, melted
      2 tb Butter
      1 lg Onion, chopped
      2 lg Carrots, shredded
      2    Celery sticks, chopped
      4 c  Vegetable broth
      1    Garlic clove, minced
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
    3/4 c  Cream, light
      1 c  Cheddar or gruyere
           -cheese, grated
    1/3 c  White wine, dry
      2 tb Parsley, minced
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Butter a baking sheet.
  
  Prepare pumpkin:  cut off the top, scoop out seeds, brush inside with
  about 2 T melted butter. Replace top and place pumpkin on baking
  sheet. Bake 45 mins or until tender when pierced with a fork. The
  pumpkin should be a bit droopy but still hold its shape well.
  
  Meanwhile, melt about 2 T butter in a big saucepan. Add onion,
  carrots, celery.  Saute until soft, about 10 mins. Add broth, garlic,
  salt, pepper and nutmeg. Cover and simmer 20 minutes. Cool slightly.
  
  Puree vegetable mixture in 2 or 3 batches in a blender or food
  processor. Put back in saucepan; stir in the cream. Reheat. Add
  cheese and wine, heat until cheese melts. Stir frequently after
  adding milk to avoid scorching. Place hot pumpkin on serving platter.
  Pour in soup. Sprinkle with parsley.
  
  Serve the soup by ladling out of the pumpkin at the table, scooping a
  little bit of pumpkin into each serving. The pumpkin then makes a
  great centerpiece for your table, while allowing people to have
  second helpings.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cheese soup in a pumpkin shell -- This recipe came from the 1983
  Half Moon Bay Pumpkin Festival and was published in our local
  newspaper in 1984.
  
  *  I use half gruyere and half cheddar.  Shred the cheeses very
  finely so they will melt rapidly. After the soup is all gone, the
  pumpkin can be cut up, washed, and used in pumpkin pie. It may need
  more baking to become soft enough to puree for the pies.
  
  *  It was impossible to find pumpkins after Halloween near San
  Francisco, but fortunately they keep for a month until Thanksgiving
  in a cool area if left uncut.
  
  *  In North America, light cream is often called half and half.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.

      Title: PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE (STEAMED)
 Categories: Cheesecake, Healthy, Cheesecakes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Pumpkin puree
      1 c  Ricotta cheese; about 7 oz
      1 tb Potato starch, cornstarch,
           -or arrowroot
    1/3 c  Sugar
    1/2    Lemon; grated zest only
      4 lg Egg whites
 
  "Although Maniere called this a "cheese cake," it's nothing like our
  rich, dense American version. His lemony pumpkin-flavored dessert is
  low-fat, airy, and souffle-like because it's made with only the
  beaten whites of the egg. The cake puffs in the steamer and then
  deflates slightly as it stands."
  
  Lightly coat a nonstick 9-inch round cake pan with vegetable oil (if
  not nonstick, lightly butter pan and line the bottom with a round of
  buttered parchment or waxed paper).
  
  Put the pumpkin puree in the bowl of a food processor. Add the ricotta
  cheese, potato starch, sugar, and lemon zest and process until smooth.
  Scrape into a large bowl.
  
  In another large bowl, beat the egg whites to stiff peaks. Stir about
  one quarter of the whites into the pumpkin mixture to lighten it.
  Then gently fold in the remaining whtes. Scrape the mixture into the
  pan with a rubber spatula and smooth the top. Cover with aluminum
  foil and press the foil around the rim to seal.
  
  Put the pan on the steamer rack, place over simmering water, cover,
  and steam 20 minutes. Then set the lid ajar and steam 5 minutes more,
  or until the cake is set and a knife inserted into the center comes
  out clean.
  
  Let the cake cool, then refrigerate until chilled.
  
  To serve, invert a serving plate over the pan and quickly reverse the
  two to unmold the cake. Remove the parchment or waxed paper, if used.
  Cut the cake into wedges. Serve cold.

      2    Egg yolks
      5    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla extract
    1/4 c  Cream, heavy
 
  MAKE PASTRY:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Grease the bottom and
  sides of a 9-inch-diameter, 3-inch deep springform pan.
  
  Prepare the pastry by stirring flour and sugar together in a bowl.
  Cut in butter, egg yolk and extract. Work the dough (which will be
  very crumbly) with hands to complete the mixing.  Evenly press the
  dough on the bottom and up the sides (to within about 1/2 inch of the
  top) of the springform pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 10
  minutes, or until golden brown. Remove and set aside to cool while
  preparing the filling.
  
  MAKE FILLING:  Increase the oven temperature to 475 degrees F. Beat
  the cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth and soft. Beat in the
  sugars, flour, spices and pumpkin until well blended. Add egg yolks
  and eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla
  extract, beat in well. Stir in the cream.
  
  Pour filling into the pastry crust.  Bake for 12 minutes. Without
  opening the oven door, reduce the oven temperature to 200 degrees F.
  and leave the cheesecake in the oven for an additional 1 hour and 15
  minutes. At the end of the baking time, turn off the oven, but leave
  the cheesecake sitting inside (without opening the door) until the
  oven cools (about 2 to 3 hours). Remove from the oven, refrigerate
  overnight.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A holiday alternative to pumpkin pie -- This cheesecake has to be
  tried to be believed. It was developed by Karen Reynolds, a charming
  lady, fine programmer and amazing cook.

    1/2 c  Heavy Cream
 
  Here's a cheesecake recipe I intend to try for Thanksgiving dinner. I
  found it in the 10/21/91 issue of New York Magazine and thought I'd
  share it with all of you.
  
  PUMPKIN CHEESECAKE WITH MAPLE/BOURBON SAUCE
  
  MAPLE - BOURBON SAUCE (recipe below)
  
  Crust: Lightly butter a 10x2 inch round cake pan. Combine gingersnap
  crumbs, nut, and butter in a bowl, and mix well. Press mixture firmly
  into prepared pan, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  
  Make Filling: In a bowl, beat cream cheese until smooth. Add sugars
  and spices, beat until light in texture, 3-4 min. Add pumpkin puree
  and mix until just blended. Stir in eggs one at a time, scraping
  sides of bowl after each addition. Stir in cream.
  
  Pour batter into crust, and put cake pan in a roasting pan. Add hot
  water to roasting pan halfway up sides of cake pan. Bake in center of
  oven until cheesecake is firm to touch and slightly puffed, about 50
  minutes.
  
  Let cheesecake cool on a wire rack for about 45 minutes. Cover, and
  refrigerate for at least 4 hours. When cheesecake is completely
  chilled, lower pan into a hotwater bath for 2-3 min. to loosen the
  crust. Invert a large, flat plate on top of cheesecake; invert pan,
  and remove. Put a second plate on bottom of cheesecake, and turn it
  right side up. Cut with a hot knife, and serve with maple/bourbon
  sauce.
  
  Cheesecake will keep for 4-5 days in refrigerator and
        2    weeks in the freezer.
  
  MAPLE-BOURBON SAUCE 1/4 C. Maple Syrup 3 Tb. Bourbon 1 C. Light Cream
  1/4 Vanilla Bean, split lengthwise 3 Lg. Egg Yolks 1/4 C. Sugar 3/4
  tsp. Cornstarch 1/3 C. Heavy Cream Whipped
  
  Combine maple syrup and bourbon in a saucepan. Over medium heat,
  bring to a boil, and cook until reduced by 1/3, about 10 minutes; set
  aside to cool.
  
  Put light cream and vanilla bean in a large saucepan, and bring to a
  boil. Immediately remove from heat, and let bean infuse cream for
  about 10 minutes. Remove bean, and scrape pulp into cream.
  
  Whisk together egg yolks, sugar and cornstarch. Stir in 1/2 C. cream
  and return mixture to saucepan with rest of cream. Stirring
  continuously, cook over low heat until thickened enough to coat back
  of a wooden spoon, 5-8 minutes.
  
  Add reduced maple syrup and bourbon, and strain through a fine sieve
  into a bowl set in ice. Stire until completely chilled, then fold in
  whipped cream.

      2 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Canned pumpkin or mashed
           -cooked pumpkin
      2 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      1    Egg, beaten,
      1    Package dry yeast
      1 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
      1 c  Bread flour
    1/2 c  Brown sugar, packed
      1    Top. ground cinnamon
      2 tb Melted butter
 
  Here's an Amish recipe that might come in handy if you got a bunch of
  punkin' stuff laying around.  The date on this is 10/12/88. That's
  right++'88!  I've had this pile of papers for a *long* time...
  
  In small saucepan, heat milk and 2 Tbs. butter just until warm (120F
  to 130F) and butter is almost melted, stirring constantly.
  
  In large mixer bowl, combine pumpkin, sugar and salt. Add milk
  mixture and beat with electric mixer until well mixed. Beat in egg
  and yeast.
  
  In separate mixing bowl, combine flours.  Add half of flour mixture to
  pumpkin mixture.  Beat mixture on low speed for 5 minutes, scraping
  sides of bowl frequently. Add remaining flour and mix thoroughly
  (dough will be very soft).  Turn into lightly greased bowl then
  grease surface of dough lightly.  Cover and let rise in warm place
  until doubled, about 1 hour.
  
  Punch dough down.  Turn onto floured surface.  Knead a few turns to
  form a smooth dough, sprinkling with enough additional flour to make
  dough easy to handle. On lightly floured surface, roll dough into 12-
  by 10-inch rectangle.
  
  In small bowl, combine brown sugar and cinnamon. Brush surface of
  dough with melted butter.  Sprinkle with brown sugar mixture.
  Beginning with long side of dough, roll up jelly-roll style. Pinch
  seam to seal.
  
  With sharp knife, cut roll into twelve 1-inch slices. Place rolls,
  cut side up, in greased 9-inch square baking pan. Cover and let rise
  until nearly doubled, 30 to 45 minutes,
  
  Bake rolls at 350F for about 20 minutes or until golden.
  
  Remove from pan to waxed paper-lined wire rack.  Cool for 10 to 15
  minutes.
  
  Makes 12 rolls.

  saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce the heat
  to low, add the pumpkin, and cook 10 minutes while stirring.
  
  In another saucepan cook the lime juice and ginger 2 minutes over
  medium heat.  Remove from the heat and pour through a sieve to remove
  the ginger. In a bowl, combine the ginger-lime juice, the lime zest
  (save some for the garnish), and cream.  Whip until the mixture has
  soft peaks.
  
  Spoon a dollop of Ginger Lime cream onto each bowl filled with soup
  and garnish with the remaining line zest.  Serve immediately.

      Title: PUMPKIN CREAM
 Categories: Digest, July, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Rice milk
    1/2 c  Solid pack pumpkin
    3/4 c  Water
    1/4 c  Tapioca flour (not pearls)
      2    To 3 TB water
      1 tb Sugar  (I've used Sucanat &
           White sugar successfully)
      1 ts Vanilla

MMMMM---------------------------OPTION--------------------------------
      1    Stick licorice root, split
           (3-4" long)
 
  Pour rice milk into a two-cup measuring cup.  Add pumpkin until liquid
  level is up to 1 1/4 cups.  Add water until level is at two cups.
  Stir, pour into pot, add licorice root, if using. Cover. Bring to
  rolling boil.
  
  While liquid is coming to a boil, mix tapioca, sweetner and 2-3 TB
  water and stir well until smooth.
  
  Once liquid is boiling, turn of flame/remove from heat. Fish out
  licorice root, if using.  Stir with a wooden spoon for around a
  minute to let the mixture cool off a bit. Stir in vanilla.
  Alternatively, stir vanilla into tapioca mixture.
  
  Continue stirring and slowly pour tapioca mixture into hot liquid. The
  liquid will gel almost immediately. Stop stirring once the mixture is
  smooth.  Cover an let it all cool off for twenty minutes or so.
  
  Pour into 1/2 cup bowls and cover with plastic, or pour into small
  jars and screw on lids (more ecological, not as pretty). Refridgerate
  and serve cold.
  
  You can eat this warm right away but I don't know if it reheats well.
  
  NOTES: If the mixture did not gel try adding some more tapioca
  immediately. I have found, though, that once the gel breaks up you
  can't fix it.
  
  Try different variations - use different "filling" or more or less
  sweetner, more vanilla, other flavorings, vary the milk/water ratio
  etc. In some cases you may need to add more thickener in order to get
  it all to gel.

           -tablespoon water for glaze
      2 tb Sugar mixed with 1 teaspoon
           -cinnamon
 
  Thanksgiving day, I whipped up the following in lieu of the
  traditional pumpkin (ho-hum) pie.  Both the crust and the filling are
  excellent. The flavors are a bit richer and more interesting than the
  traditional punkin' pie (at least my punkin' pie).  The only problem
  that I encountered was that the dough was a bit hard to handle++it
  tended to tear and was a bit hard to roll out thin.  That may be
  because instead of chilling it for a half-hour like the recipe says,
  I put it in the fridge and forgot about it for two and a half hours!
  It seemed to get easier to handle as it warmed up.  Also, instead of
  making the dough by hand, I used my food processor and it turned out
  just fine. Just don't over process the dough if you do it that way
  
  These remind me of Mexican Dim-Sum.  In fact I'm sure that they'd be
  good with meat fillings too++say, curried pork or beef and onions
  (without the final sprinkling of cinnamon sugar though).
  
  Sift together first 4 ingredients.  Cut in the shortening and butter
  using a pastry blender or 2 knives. The mixture should resemble
  coarse meal.
  
  Combine brandy and milk, and drizzle over flour mixture, stirring
  with a fork to distribute.  Do not over-blend.
  
  Form into a flat disc and wrap in plastic wrap.  Chill for 30 minutes.
  
  Preheat oven to 400F.
  
  To make the filling, blend together the pumpkin, brown sugar, spices,
  egg and vanilla.
  
  When dough is chilled, roll out thinly on a floured board or pastry
  cloth. Cut into 4- or 5-inch circles. Place about 2 tablespoons
  pumpkin filling on the lower half of each dough circle. Fold over top
  half. Press the edges together with a fork.  Brush tops with egg wash
  and place on a baking sheet.  Bake for 15 to 18 minutes, or until
  golden.
  
  While still warm, sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar. These may be
  baked 1 day ahead.  Before serving, warm in a 350F oven for 8
  minutes. Makes 14 to 16 empanadas. Pumpkin Empanadas (Jacqueline

      Title: PUMPKIN FLAN
 Categories: Vegetables, Desserts, Holiday
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           INGREDIENTS:
      1 c  Pumpkin
    1/4 c  Honey
    3/4 ts Cinnamon
      5    Eggs
      1 cn (13 oz.) Carnation
           -evaporated milk
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 tb Brandy (or Asbach-Uralt),
           -optional
    1/4 c  Brown sugar, packed
 
  (TIP:) Six individual custard cups can be used as well as the form in
  the main recipe section.   Bake them at 325 degrees for 45 minutes,
  and test with a knife at the edge of the custard. The center will
  continue to cook when  removed  from the oven because of the small
  size. Cover and chill. For a pumpkin flan "brulee" sprinkle the brown
  sugar over the BAKED custard (rather than in the bottom of the cup)
  and broil 4 inches from the heat until the  sugar bubbles, watching
  every second....it burns *very* easily. When the sugar bubbles,
  remove it immediately, cover and chill.
  
  Combine  the pumpkin,  honey and cinnamon.   Beat the eggs. Add milk,
  vanilla and pumpkin mixture to the eggs. Stir in the brandy, mixing
  well.
  
  Sprinkle  the  brown sugar over the BOTTOM of a buttered 10-inch
  baking dish.  S-l-o-w-l-y  pour in the custard mixture and place the
  baking dish in a pan of hot water. Bake (together with the pan of hot
  water) at 350 degrees for one hour, or until the custard is set.
  Insert a knife into the custard.  If it comes out clean, the custard
  is done. Cover and chill for 2 to 4 hours before serving.

      Title: PUMPKIN GNOCCHI
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Canned pumpkin
      2    Egg whites
      1    Flour
 
  Whisk together the pumpkin and the egg whites until blended. Then add
  flour and stir until the dough is thick enough to be turned out onto
  a large cutting board or clean table top. Douse with more flour, and
  work/knead it into the dough.  When fully incorporated add more flour
  and repeat. Keep adding flour and kneading until the dough can hold
  its own shape. It will still be a little bit sticky.
  
  At this stage, I chilled the dough overnight, but I have no idea if
  doing so was essential to the success of my gnocchi--I was just
  starting to feel really guilty about those essays I hadn't yet graded.
  
  When you're ready to eat the gnocchi, get a pot of boiling water
  going on the stove.  Generously flour your board or tabletop and
  hands. Cut the dough into fourths and roll each fourth into a
  cylinder, and slice off gnocchi-sized chunks.  I have to be vague
  about measurements because I was having a hard time with my cylinder
  rolling technique and at one point just hacked the cylinder in two
  lengthwise to speed things along. I aimed for 1/2-inch chunks, but
  some were bigger than that. Drop into salted boiling water. As they
  rise to the surface, remove them with a slotted spoon, shake off
  excess water, and put them on a serving plate.
  
  Having once watched Martha Stewart shape gnocchi on TV, I tried to
  emulate her technique of pressing them gently against the tines of a
  form before dropping them in the water for about half of my gnocchi.
  They turned out just as ugly as the ones I more carelessly dropped in
  the water without shaping.  YM(and skill)MV.
  
  The recipe provided me with two substantial dinners for myself, once I
  topped the gnocchi with some leftover TVP chili.

    1/8 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Cream of tartar
 
  Use either canned pumpkin puree or make your own fresh puree:
  
  To cook fresh pumpkin: Select a medium-sized eating pumpkin (not the
  jack o' lantern variety which is too stringy). This pumpkin is almost
  white and looks like a big squash. Slice pumpkin in half and scoop
  out the inner pulp and seeds. Place halved pumpkin in large roasting
  pan with cut side down. Since water is given off as the pumpkin cooks
  the pan must have a depth of at least 1 inch. If one pan is not big
  enough for pumpkin halves to lie flat, use two. Bake at 350 degrees F
  about 1 hour or until the pumpkin is tender and pierces easily with a
  fork. Turn pumpkin halves over and allow to cool. When pumpkin has
  cooled, scrape the pulp away from the skin and puree in blender or
  put through a food mill. Pumpkin puree may be frozen for later use in
  a tightly covered container. It will keep about six months.
  
  To make ice cream: Combine evaporated milk, egg yolks, brown sugar,
  and spices in top of double boiler. Using a wire whisk beat the
  ingredients until smooth. Place top over simmering water and cook
  until custard thickens, stirring constantly.
  
  Remove from heat. Stir in 1 cup pumpkin puree. Set aside.
  
  In medium-sized bowl beat egg whites, salt, and cream of tartar until
  stiff peaks are formed. Fold beaten egg whites into pumpkin custard.
  Scrape into freezer container or serving dish, cover tightly, and
  freeze until firm (about 3 hours).
  
  Serve directly from freezer (doesn't have to ripen in refrigerator
  first).
  
  This ice cream is best if eaten within 1 week.

  until a knife inserted halfway between the center and edge comes out
  clean. Remove the pie from the oven and increase the oven temperature
  to 425 degrees F. To make the meringue, beat the egg whites and the
  1/8ts of salt in a bowl, using an electric mixer set on high, until
  foamy. Gradually add the 6 tbls of sugar, 1 tbls at a time, beating
  well after each addition. Continue beating until stiff, glossy peaks
  from when the beaters are slowly lifted. Spoon some of the meringue
  around the edge of the warm pie. Spread the meringue so that it
  touches the inner edge of the crust all the way around the pie, using
  the back of a spoon to do this. Heap the remaining meringue in the
  center and, again using the back of the spoon, push it out to meet
  with the meringue border. Using a flatware knife, form light small
  peaks in the meringue and then bake in the preheated oven for 5
  minutes or until the meringue is lightly browned. Cool on a wire rack.

 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Complete baking mix (I use
           Arrowhead mills multigrain
           Which
           Is lacto but not ovo and is
           Lf)
      1 c  Pumpkin (1/2 can)
    1/4 c  Molasses
    1/2 c  Water
    1/4 ts Each (or to taste) ground
           Allspice, nutmeg, cloves,
           And
           Cinnamon
    1/2 c  Raisins
 
  stir all ingredients except raisins together until just mixed. fold in
  raisins.  spoon into nonstick muffin tin (or use cupcake papers).
  bake at 400 f 25 minutes for regular muffin tins, 35 minutes for
  large muffin tins.
  
  canned pumpkin seems to work about as well as applesauce for a baking
  substitute for oil.  these muffins are quite chewy, but they are very
  moist and tasty. I enhanced the pumpkin flavor with traditional
  pumpkin pie spices, but the flavor could be downplayed for other
  kinds of cakes or muffins, and would blend well with flavors like
  banana or orange, and would be overshadowed by cocoa, for example.

  Take a large pumpkin, wash, cut in half and place, cut side down, in
  pan in warm oven. Roast until soft, but not mushy. Scrape out the
  flesh of the pumpkin with a spoon or fork. Place into colander and
  let drain over night in a cool place. The next morning, put 2 cups of
  the pumpkin in a bowl and whip thoroughly with a fork until all lumps
  disappear, but avoid mashing. Drain out as much liquid as possible,
  because the pumpkin should be dry. Add the sugar, yolks of eggs,
  cinnamon and beat for 5 minutes. Quickly add the cream, the whiskey
  and the butter, and mix well. Sprinkle the cornstarch over the
  stiffly beaten whites of eggs and add to the first mixture. Pour into
  a pan about 2 1/2 inches deep which has been lined with pie pastry,
  and bake for one hour at 375-F. Allow pie to become cold before
  using. Source:  Pennsylvania Dutch Cook Book - Fine Old Recipes,

 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 72 Servings
 
  3 1/2 c  Flour
  1 1/2 c  Brown sugar, packed
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Pumpkin pie spice
    1/2 c  Canned pumpkin
      2 lg Eggs, lightly beaten
           (NOTE: use egg substitute or
           -4 egg whites)
      1 tb Vanilla
      2 tb Butter or margarine (*NOTE)
  1 1/4 c  Macadamia nuts, coarsely
           -chopped (*NOTE)
 
  Combine first 5 ingredients in a large bowl; stir well. Combine
  pumpkin, eggs and vanilla; stirring well with a wire whisk. Slowly
  add pumpkin mixture to flour mixture, stirring until dry ingredients
  are moistened. (Mixture will be very crumbly; it will gradually
  become moist after stirring.)
  
  Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; add macadamia nuts.
  Cook, stirring constantly, until nuts are browned. Remove from heat,
  and cool completely. Knead or gently stir cooled nuts into dough.
  
  *NOTE: I never use nuts in my biscotti in order to lower the fat
  content and personally don't miss them at all. I will simply omit the
  nuts, thereby also leaving out the butter. If you want to use the
  nuts, cut the amount of nuts and butter in half.
  
  Place dough on a lightly floured surface, and divide into 4 portions.
  Lightly flour hands, and shape each portion into a 1" x 15" slightly
  flattened log. Place logs 3" apart on lightly greased large cookie
  sheets.
  
  Bake at 350 for 23 minutes; cool logs 15 minutes. Reduce oven
  temperature to 300.
  
  Cut each log crosswise into 1/2" slices, using a serrated knife. Place
  slices on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake at 300 for 15 minutes. Cool
  completely on wire racks.
  
  NOTES : This twice-baked cookie with staying power makes enough
  extras to package and send as gifts.  Very good!!

      1    "Small Sugar" pumpkin*
      2    Eggs
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
      8 oz Cream cheese

  Ogden writes:  "...  this recipe makes a light fluffy pie that shows
  off the flavor of our Small Sugar pumpkins. " *This recipe should
  work with other pumpkins, however.
  
  Slice pumpkin in half and place halves face down on a pie sheet in a
  350 F oven.  Bake 1 hour, or until knife penetrates skin easily.
  Remove from oven, scoop out seeds and scrape pumpkin pulp from skin -
  yield two cups. In a food processor, blend until smooth with the
  remaining ingredients, using the steel blade. Pour into pie crust and
  bake at 375 F for
       40    minutes.

  center of the bowl. Do this until the dough makes a ball. If the
  dough is too dry, mix in up to 2 tbls of water.  Knead lightly on a
  floured cloth-covered surface, adding flour if dough is sticky, until
  smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. Cover and let rest for another 5
  minutes. Divide the dough into 4 equal parts. Roll the dough, one
  part at a time, into a rectangle about 12 X 10-inches. (Keep the rest

    1/3 lb Parmesan cheese
           -- freshly grated
      2 tb Maple syrup
      1 lg Egg; lightly beaten
           Salt and pepper; to taste
  1 1/2 lb Fresh pasta, in sheets

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      1 c  Hazelnuts
      3 c  Heavy cream
      3    Garlic cloves; minced
      1 pn Cayenne
      1 pn White pepper
      1 pn Salt
      2 c  Sorrel, stems removed
           --(cut into 1/8-inch strips)
 
  PASTA: If you can't find frozen pasta sheets or prefer to make your
  own, here's a recipe that's virtually foolproof. Herbs and spices
  compatible with the dish can be kneaded into the dough toward the end.
  
  Heap the flour and make a well in it.  Break the eggs into the well
  and beat them together with a fork. Stir them into the flour from the
  bottom of the well with the fork until the dough in the center is
  smooth or shiny. With your hands, gradually incorporate the flour
  from the outside of the well toward the center, kneading gently until
  the mass of dough comes together.
  
  Knead the dough until it is smooth and resilient.  You may need to
  add more flour, or you may not be able to incorporate all of the
  flour, depending on the humidity and the size of the eggs. If the
  dough is sticky or extremely pliable, knead more flour into it.
  
  Divide the dough into three portions, cover them with plastic wrap or
  an overturned bowl, and allow to rest for at least 30 minutes.
  
  FILLING: Puree the cooked pumpkin or squash and carrots in a food
  processor until smooth.
  
  Saute the onions, garlic, and spices in butter until the onions are
  soft, then add to the pureed vegetables. Add the cheese, maple syrup,
  egg, salt, and pepper.  Taste the adjust seasoning, then set the
  filling aside.
  
  SAUCE: Preheat oven to 400 F and toast the hazelnuts in a shallow pan
  on the middle rack for 10 to 12 minutes or until brown and fragrant.
  Remove from the oven. When they are cool enough to handle, wrap the
  nuts tightly in a lint-free towel and vigorously rub them against the
  towel. Open the towel carefully and pick out the nuts and continue
  rubbing until the nuts are almost blond.
  
  Cook the cream, garlic, cayenne, and pepper over high heat, stirring
  often and adjusting heat to keep the cream from boiling over. When
  the cream is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, add the salt,
  taste, and adjust seasoning.  Remove sauce from heat until you're
  ready to use it.
  
  ASSEMBLY: If you're making your own pasta, roll the dough out very
  thin on a lightly floured surface, one portion at a time. If you have
  a pasta machine, follow the manufacturer's instructions for rolling
  out the dough into sheets about 1 millimeter thick.
  
  Lay one pasta sheet out on a flat surface and spray it with water to
  prevent drying and to make it more flexible. Place half tablespoons of
  filling along the bottom edge of the pasta about 1/2 inch apart. For
  larger ravioli, use 1 tablespoon of filling and leave 1 inch between
  dollops. Fold the pasta sheet over the filling and cut apart with a
  ravioli cutter. Set the finished ravioli aside and cover with a damp
  cloth.
  
  Cook the ravioli in salted boiling water al dente. Reheat the sauce,
  then drain the ravioli.  Add the shredded sorrel to the sauce and
  cook just until it wilts -- about 30 seconds. Add half the hazelnuts,
  turn the heat off, and add the cooked ravioli.  Stir gently and serve
  immediately. Garnish with the remaining hazelnuts.

      4    Shallots, chopped
      5 c  Chicken-like or veggie
           Stock
      2 c  Arborio rice (Japanese rice

           Or stock)
      1 tb Fresh sage
        x  Salt & freshly ground black

  Wrap cubed pumpkin in foil and bake at 350o for 30 min. While it is
  baking, saute shallots in a little white wine, water or stock. In a
  seperate pan, bring the stock to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer.
  Puree pumpkin and set aside. Add rice to shallots and cook 2-3
  minutes over moderate heat stirring frequently. Add wine and saffron
  and cook, stirring constantly until all the lquid has been absorbed.
  Add the pumpkin and 1 c stock stirring constantly. After that is
  absorbed, add the stock 1/2 cup at a time stirring constantly until
  absorbed until the rice is cooked (about 15-20 min).  If you run out
  of stock add hot water. The risotto should be thick and creamy in
  consistensy and just a little runny. When done remove from heat, add
  the sage, salt and pepper to taste. If you want to add 1/4 c grated
  parmesan it would add 1 gram fat/ serving.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1    Egg
      2 c  Flour, self-raising
      1 c  Pumpkin, cooked
           -(cold), mashed
    1/8 ts Salt
 
  Grease a scone tray or baking tray.  Cream together the butter and
  sugar until light and fluffy. Add egg and beat well.
  
  Add pumpkin, flour and salt and fold in by hand. Knead lightly and
  cut into 1-inch squares. Place close together on the scone tray and
  bake at 425 degrees F. until well risen and golden on top (about 15
  minutes). Serve hot, with butter.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pumpkin scones -- Scones (pronounced with a short `o', rhymes with
  `Fonz') are a popular accompaniment to afternoon tea. They are often
  served with jam and whipped cream. In this variation the scones are
  flavoured with pumpkin. It is not a typical scone recipe.
  
  Pumpkin scones can be eaten in place of bread with a meal. This
  recipe was made famous by the wife of the Premier of Queensland.
  Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  To an Australian, a pumpkin is a large round, squat, green or
  blue-green vegetable that is orange on the inside. There are many
  varieties, all of species Cucurbita maxima. In North America a good
  substitute is acorn squash (Cucurbita pepo); elsewhere a butternut
  squash (Caryoka nuciferum) would be a fair substitute.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 15 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: PUMPKIN SOUP (EDWARDS)
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           None
 
  Recently I was at a local restaurant and found they had pumpkin soup,
  made without butter!  It was rather like eating hot, liquid pumpkin
  pie. I asked for the recipe, and here it is.
  
  I recommend accompanying it with a nice sourdough bread or something
  similar.
  
  Cook a medium sized pumpkin, using any method with which you are
  comfortable.  The new honey pumpkins now available are really great
  for this purpose!  Scoop out the cooked pumpkin, and blend it in the
  blender adding non-fat milk or rice dream until the desired thickness
  is reached. Return to a pan and season with cinammon, clove, nutmeg
  and/or pumpkin pie spice to taste. I don't specify measurements
  because everyone has a different idea of how much of these kinds of
  spices to use. Heat on low until desired temperature is reached.
  
  For a really special treat, froth up non-fat milk (sweetened if
  desired) with a capuccino machine steam thingy, and float mounds on
  the top of the soup with pumpkin pie spices on top.
  
  I apologize for the randomness of this recipe, but this is the way it
  was given to me, and I find myself experimenting with it often,
  changing spices, adding maple syrup for a desert soup, adding
  thickener for a pumpking pudding variation.  It's great for a cold
  night pick-me-up, and kids love it!

      Title: PUMPKIN SOUP WITH CHIVES
 Categories: Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Soups, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Onion; diced
      5 c  Homemade chicken stock
           -- well seasoned
  2 1/2 c  Pumpkin puree
           -- canned or fresh*
           Salt and nutmeg; to taste
           Cayenne pepper; to taste
      2 c  Light cream

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
           Whipped cream (opt'l.)
           Fresh chives; chopped

MMMMM------------------------PRESENTATION-----------------------------
           Hollowed-out pumpkin shell
           -plus lid (opt'l.)
 
  *If using fresh pumpkin:  Wash, halve and scrape out seeds and fiber.
  Peel and cube.  Cook, covered, in boiling water until tender (about
  25 minutes). Mash in blender or by hand and let drain in strainer for
  30 minutes. You'll need about 5 cups of cubed fresh pumpkin to yield
  enough cooked puree. If you plan to use the pumpkin shell as the soup
  tureen, cook all the cubed pumpkin, saving any leftover puree for use
  in pies, breads or muffins.
  
  To make the soup:  Cook diced onion with stock in a large saucepan for
  about 10 minutes.  Add pumpkin puree and seasonings. Process in
  blender or food processor until smooth. Return to saucepan. Add cream
  and heat through, but do not allow to boil. Taste and adjust
  seasonings.
  
  Ladle into pumpkin shell if desired, replace lid, and ladle into
  individual bowls at the table.  Garnish each with a dollop of whipped
  cream and sprinkle with chopped chives.

 Categories: Cakes, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Seedless raisins
      1 c  Walnuts
      2 c  All-purpose flour
      2 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Ground cloves
      2 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 ts Ground ginger
      4 lg Eggs
      2 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Salad oil
           - (use fresh oil only)
     16 oz Cn pumpkin (not pie filling)
 
    Preheat oven to 325-degrees.
  
    Sterilize 8 Ball Quilted Crystal (#14400-81400) jam/jelly canning
  jars, lids and rings by boiling them for 15 minutes. Remove the jars
  and allow them to air-dry on your countertop; leave the lids and
  rings in the water until you're ready to use them. Once the jars are
  cool enough to handle, grease the insides with shortening (DO NOT use
  butter, margarine, PAM or Baker's Secret).
  
    Coarsely chop the raisins and walnuts; set aside. I used my mini
  chopper and did them in batches.
  
    Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cloves,
  cinnamon and ginger in a lg bowl. Add raisins and walnuts; toss to
  lightly combine; set aside.
  
    In another large bowl, beat eggs at high speed until thick and
  yellow (2-3 minutes). Gradually beat in the sugar until thick and
  light. At low speed, beat in the oil and pumpkin; blend well.
  Gradually stir in the flour mixture until well blended. Divide batter
  among the 8 canning jars (should be slightly less than 1/2 full).
  Wipe the sides of the jar off in case you slop or it'll burn (mine
  did -- didn't wipe them down). Place jars on a cookie sheet or
  they'll tip over.
  
    Bake in preheated 325-degree oven for about 40 minutes or until
  toothpick inserted into center of cakes (deep) and comes out clean.
  Move the jars around in the oven while they're baking so they bake
  evenly.
  
    When cakes test done, remove them one-by-one (use HEAVY DUTY mitts);
  place a HOT lid, then a ring on and screw down tightly. Place jars
  onto your countertop to cool completely.

      Title: PUMPKIN SPICE CAKE IN JARS  (OVEN METHOD)
 Categories: Cakes, Fruits, Gifts
      Yield: 7 -8 jars
 
      1 c  Seedless raisins
      1 c  Walnuts
      2 c  All-purpose flour
      2 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Ground cloves
      2 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 ts Ground ginger
      4    Eggs
      2 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Salad oil (use fresh oil)
      1 cn (16 oz) pumpkin OR   *
      2 c  Freshley cooked and mashed
           -pumpkin
 
     *  Do not use pumpkin pie filling.
  
     Preheat oven to 325  F.  Grease the inside of 8 - 1 pint
  wide-mouth Kerr or Ball canning jars or Ball Quality Crystal (12 oz.)
  with Crisco (do not use a spray like Pam or Baker's Secret); set
  aside. The 1 pint jars are shorter but bigger around and hold more
  than the decorative 12 oz. jars, use either one.  The 1 pint jars
  don't come with labels though, so you'll have to make your own.
     Coarsely chop the raisins and walnuts; set aside. I used my mini
  chopper and did them in batches.
     Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cloves,
  cinnamon, and ginger into a large bowl. Add raisins and walnuts; toss
  lightly to combine.
     In another large bowl, beat eggs at high speed until thick and
  yellow (2-3 minutes).  Gradually beat in the sugar until thick and
  light. At low speed, beat in the oil and pumpkin; blend well.
  Gradually stir in the flour mixture until well blended.
     Divide mixture among the 7 or 8 canning jars (should be slightly
  less than 1/2 full).  Wipe the sides of the jar in case you slop, or
  it'll burn. Place jars on a cookie sheet or they'll tip over.
     Bake in a preheated 325  F. oven for about 40 minutes or until
  toothpick inserted into center of cakes (deep) comes out clean. When
  cakes test done, remove them, one at a time and immediately place the
  lids and rings on them.
     You must boil the lids, rings, and jars for 10 minutes to
  sterilize them before using.  Keep the lids in the hot water until
  you use them. Take them out, one by one and put them onto the jars.
     If you'd like to make a regular cake out of this without messing
  with the jars:
     Grease a 13 x 9 x 2-inch baking pan.  Bake in preheated 350 F.
  oven for 50 minutes or until cake tests done. If you like spicy cake,
  this will be one of your favorites. Ellie

   Preheat oven to 325-degrees.
  
   Sterilize 8 (12 oz) Ball Quilted Crystal Canning Jars (14400-81400),
  lids and rings by boiling them for 10 minutes. Leave the lids and

  and allow the jars to air-dry and cool. Prepare the batter in the
  meantime.
   Using a pastry brush, brush the inside of the cooled jars with
  shortening (DO NOT use Pam or Baker's Secret); set aside.
  
   Coarsely chop the raisins and walnuts; set aside.
   Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cloves,
  cinnamon and ginger in a large bowl. Add raisins and walnuts; toss to

  Gradually stir in the flour mixture until well blended.
  
   Divide among the 8 canning jars (should be slightly less than 1/2
  full. Wipe the sides of the jar off (inside/ outside) in case you
  slop or it'll burn. Place jars onto a cookie sheet or they'll tip
  over.
  
   Bake 35 to 40 minutes or until a pick inserted into the center of
  each jar comes out clean.
   Have your lids and rings ready. Take one jar at a time from the oven;
  place a lid and ring on and screw down tightly. Use HEAVY-DUTY
  mitts--the jars are HOT! Place the jars onto your counter top too
  cool. You'll know when they've sealed, you'll hear a "plinking sound".

           Topping:
      6 tb Butter, softened
      1 c  Brown sugar
      1 c  Walnuts, coarsely chopped
 
  Blend zwieback crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar, and the 6 tablespoons melted
  butter. Press firmly over bottom and up sides of a lightly buttered
  9-inch spring-form pan. Chill. Beat the cream cheese until smooth.
  Add the 3/4 cup sugar and the 3/4 cup brown sugar, beating until well
  mixed. Beat in the eggs one at a time, until mixture is light and
  fluffy. Beat in the pumpkin pie spice and the heavy cream at low
  speed. Mix in the pumpkin. Pour into prepared pan. Bake in a slow
  oven (325) for one hour and 35 minutes. While pie is baking, mix the
  topping ingredients (the last 3 ingredients), first the butter and
  brown sugar until crumbly, then blending in the nuts. After the one
  hour and 35 minutes, remove the pie from the oven. Spread the topping
  over it, and return it to the oven for 10 minutes. Remove from oven
  and cool on a wire rack. Refrigerate for several hours, or overnight.
  This cheesecake is rather large, and incredibly rich. Everyone always
  wants more than they can fit in their stomach! And the recipe!
  :-) Serving suggestion: Some like this garnished with whipped cream
  and more walnuts, or with whipped cream and pecans.

 Categories: Greek, Appetizers
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      1    Pumpkin (4 to 4 1/2 lbs.)
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      2 tb Ground cinnamon
      1 c  Chopped walnuts
      1 lb Commercial phyllo sheets
    1/2 c  Olive oil or butter; melted
 
  Cut the pumpkin in half, remove and discard the seeds, the peel using
  a sharp knife.  Grate the pumpkin on the medium holes of a cheese
  grater (there should be approximately 4 cups of finely grated
  pumpkin). Taste for flavor, adding more sugar if desired.  Start to
  roll the "snails". Lay the phyllo flat and deep, covered with a damp
  towel except when rolling. Brush one filo sheet lightly with the oil
  and fold in half lengthwise. Spread a row of filling (about 3 to 4
  tablespoons) across the length of one end of the filo to within an
  inch of each edge. Roll up to seal the filling, forming a long tube.
  Then, beginning at one end, curl up tightly into a "snail-like" coil
  and set on a baking sheet. Continue until all the filling has been
  used, keeping the rolls covered with waxed paper or plastic to avoid
  drying.  Brush the rolls with oil or butter and bake in a 350 degree
  oven for 25 minutes or until puffy and crisp. Serve warm or cold with
  poultry or game dishes.  From: "The Food of Greece" by Vilma

      Title: PUMPKIN-BLACK WALNUT BISCUITS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Unbleached all purpose flour
    1/4 ts Ground allspice
      2 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Butter, cold
      1 tb Baking powder
    1/3 c  Finely chopped black walnuts
      1 ts Baking soda
    2/3 c  Canned or mashed cooked
           -pumpkin
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Buttermilk, or a bit more if
           -needed
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Grated nutmeg
 
  Sugar
  
  "A batch of these intriguingly flavored biscuits is a nice addition
  to any meal. This particular biscuit has a tendency to overbrown on
  the bottom, so use a light-colored metal baking sheet instead of a
  nonstick sheet. Serve the biscuits hot with butter."
  
  Preheat oven to 450 F.  Sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder
  and soda, salt, and spices into a large bowl. Cut in the butter (or
  use food processor) until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add
  the nuts. In a small bowl, whisk together the pumpkin and buttermilk.
  Add it to the flour mixture and stir to combine. The dough will be
  quite stiff and not all the flour will be incorporated. Turn the
  dough out onto a lightly floured cloth and knead gently a few times
  to work in the rest of the flour. Roll out the dough to a 1/2 inch
  thickness and cut with a 2 inch round cutter. Transfer the biscuits
  to a lightly oiled shiny baking sheet, and sprinkle tops with sugar.
  Bake for 10 minutes--do not let them get too brown. Serve immediately
  with butter.  If you must have jelly with the, choose a delicate
  apple jelly so the subtle pumpkin flavor is not masked.

 Categories: Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  :          ***** NONE *****
  
  Selecting and storing: Pass on the jack-o'-lantern variety (too tough
  and stringy! ); for cooking, always choose a sugar pie pumpkina
  smaller, sweeter variety with a finer flesh. Select a crack- and
  soft-spot-free pumpkin with a rounded, dry stem. If the stem is
  blackened or moist, move on. Store in a cool dry place, uncut, for up
  to 1 month. If cut, wrap tightly and refrigerate up to 1 week. Buy
  canned. It's an excellent alternative; just as pure, equally
  nutritious, and so quick and easy!
  
  Enjoying: Here's the simplest way to prepare fresh pumpkin: Rinse,
  cut in half and scoop out seeds and stringy fibers. Place cut sides
  down in a baking pan with 1/4 in. water. Bake at 350F about 45 min.
  When cool, scoop out soft flesh and drain in a colander. Puree in a
  food processor, then drain again thoroughly. Use immediately or
  freeze up to 9 months in 1 c. containers for later use. (Even
  simpler, open a can!) Spice up the autumn air; get out your favorite
  pumpkin recipes, but reduce the fat: For pumpkin pie, use evaporated
  skim milk, not cream, and egg substitute instead of eggs, and buy a
  low-fat graham-cracker crust; for pumpkin bread, replace the oil with
  half as much prune puree and use egg substitute; or brew a warm, cozy
  pumpkin soup, using evaporated skim milk, not heavy cream! Slather
  pumpkin puree (canned or fresh) mixed with molasses (to taste) on a
  multigrain, nonfat toasted waffle for a nutritious breakfast, lunch
  or after-school snack.-by Mary Nagle with Teresa Yeykal

 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Serving
 
      4 lb Sugar pumpkin
      2 md Leeks
      1    Yellow onion
      2    Cloves garlic; peeled
      1 c  Young goat cheese; crumbled
      2 c  Milk;*
      4    Sprigs thyme
 
  * or 1 cup each milk and cream for a richer gratin
  
  Preheat oven to 375 F. Peel pumpkin, quarter, remove seeds and
  strings. Slice into 1/4-inch thick "planks" and set aside.
  
  Trim leeks, remove tough outer leaves, and wash free of all dirt.
  Slice across in thin julienne strips. Peel, halve and julienne the
  onion, and slice the garlic thinly.
  
  Saute the leeks, onion and garlic together in olive oil until tender.
  Season well with salt and pepper.
  
  In the bottom of an oiled 10-inch gratin dish, scatter some of the
  leek mixture around. Evenly lay the pumpkin slices over the leeks,
  completely covering the surface. Scatter more of the leek mixture
  over the pumpkin and dot  with crumbled goat cheese. Season with
  salt, pepper and chopped thyme leaves. Moisten with the milk. Repeat
  this until layers fill the dish; then add enough milk to submerge the
  ingredients completely.
  
  Cover and bake on a sheet for about 30 minutes or until the pumpkin is
  tender. Carefully pour off the excess milk and dot the surface of the
  gratin with more goat cheese. Place under the broiler for a few
  minutes until the surface is lightly browned.

      Title: PUNJABI STYLE SPINICH/SAAG
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Yellow onion, chopped
      1    Clove of garlic, finely
           Chopped
      1    Hot pepper (he uses whole
           Dried red pepper and crushes
           It)
      1 ds Oil, Pam or saute liquid
      1 ts Huldi or tumeric
      1    Salt to taste
      1    Bag of Fresh spinich
      1    Potato, peeled and cubed
 
  First WASH the spinich very well.  Break off ugly parts of leaves and
  stems. Peel and cube the potato. Place both in a large saucepan and
  add very little water, about 1/4 cup. Let cook on Med temp. until the
  potatoes are cooked, adding water when needed and then only a little
  at a time.
  
  When the potatoes are done, heat another deepsided frying pan. Add
  oil, Pam or saute liquid. When the saute medium is hot add the garlic
  and onion. Fry until the onion is translucent. Add salt, hot pepper
  and huldi. Fry some more.  The huldi should turn everything yellow.
  
  Incidently, huldi is very good for your stomach, reduces gas when
  used in dal recipies.
  
  Fry everything together for about a minute, don't let the onions turn
  brown, turn down the heat if needed.
  
  Add the spinich to the onion mixture, stirring constantly but not
  hard.
  
  Serve with cornmeal roti.

      Title: PUNJABI-STYLE GARAM MASALA
 Categories: Sauces, Indian
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
  2 1/2 tb Green cardamom pods
      4 tb Cumin seeds
      5 tb Coriander seeds
    1/4 ts Ajowan seeds
      3    Blades of mace;  OR...
    1/4 ts -Ground mace
      2 tb Black peppercorns

      2    Cinnamon sticks, 3" long
      1    Bay leaf
    1/4 ts Ground ginger
      1 tb Ground nutmeg
 
  A little of this warm, spicy blend goes a long way. Coming from North
  India, where meat is eaten more frequently than in the South, it is
  the kind of masala that's popular as an accompaniment for almost any
  meat dish, as a condiment or in the sauce.
  
  Grind toasted ingredients with mace, peppercorns, cloves, cinnamon,
  and bay leaf, and mix well with the other ground ingredients.

 Categories: Info/tips
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Oil of cloves
      1 tb Paprika
      1 ts Black pepper
 
  Mix the oil, paprika and pepper and pour it into a small container
  with a tight-fitting lid. Label and keep away from children.
  
  To use: Dab it on your furniture legs, chairs, tables, rugs to
  discourage puppies from getting on the furniture. The scent will wear
  off after awhile, you may have to reapply it if your puppy isn't
  completely trained.
  
  This solution works to keep puppies away from furniture and rugs. The
  scent isn't distasteful to people, only to ultra-"scent"-sitive
  puppies.

      Title: PURE VEGAN GUMBO
 Categories: Vegetables, Oct.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Okra
    1/2 c  Olive oil
    3/4 c  Flour
      4 c  Vegetable stock
      1    To 2 cayenne chilis, or 2 t
           Fresh crushed chilis, or
           Whatever is
           Available
        x  Onion
        x  Green pepper
        x  Greens (7 types)
           If using fresh or canned,
           I'll assume you know how to
           Handle
 
  That will make the base.  Here is how you do it:
  
  There are three critical tasks:
  
  1)Make the roux.  Heat the oil in a small saucepan under low to med
  heat, add flour slowly.  Stir non stop for about 20 - 30 minutes.
  This is made less painful if you have a glass of wine to drink and
  some music playing. Don't try to rush it, or you'll end up having to
  start all over. When you get a pretty brown color and a nice nutty
  smell, it is ready. A suggestion, if you discover you like gumbo,
  make extra roux. It can be frozen for later use.
  
  2)Slice the okra crosswise, and saute.  It will do something very
  amusing. It is called roping - it will look like there are strings of
  cheese between pieces. When it stops making "new rope" (that is, a
  nice steady state) it is ready.
  
  3)Adding the roux to the hot stock.  Do a little at a time, try to
  have at the same temp, stir.  You don't want the roux to separate. It
  always does a little on me, just stir.
  
  Obviously 1 and 2 should not be attempted simultaneously. Unless you
  have someone to share the wine and cooking chores.
  
  Stir in the fresh crushed chili.  Now you have your base. Time to
  make it ready to eat.
  
  The original idea was to use 7 or more greens.  The exact
  interpretation and balance does not matter. Kale, collard, mustard
  greens, parsley, chard, escarole (my favorite), whatever you like.
  Saute an onion, green pepper if you like.  Throw it all in, and 20
  minutes later you have a nice gumbo. Sorry I don't give exact
  numbers. Still, a good guess might be 2.5 pounds greens to make this.
  A lot depends on personal preference. Gumbo should not be viewed as a
  special recipe, it should be a fun experiment. If you would like to
  make it more "meaty" than consider using some of the "fake meats"
  available in oriental grocery stores. Mock duck, mock abalone, mock
  shrimp, whatever, all work.
  
  To serve: put a scoop of rice in a bowl, ladel gumbo over. Have some
  spoonbread on the side, or just ordinary cornbread.

  water. Bring to a boil and simmer for 20-25 minutes and strain. Cut
  off the very tips of the asparagus and set aside. Chop the middle
  pieces and set aside.
  
   Saute the leeks, onions and shallots in olive oil over medium heat
  for 5 minutes, stirring often. Add the middle pieces of asparagus,
  salt, pepper and parsley and stock. Simmer for 10 minutes or until
  asparagus is tender. Blend with the miso and strain well through a
  fine screen or food mill.
  
   Blend the tofu and add to the soup. In another pot bring a few cups
  of water to a boil with a little salt. Cook the asparagus tips until
  crisp-tender and strain in a colander. Garnish soup with asparagus
  tips. Serves 6-8.

      Title: PUREE OF YELLOW SQUASH SOUP
 Categories: Digest, Soups
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Yellow crooked-neck squash (
           Approx  6 small ones)
      2 c  Chopped onion
      1    Clove garlic, sliced
      2 tb Butter ( I ommitted this
           Altogether)
    1/2 ts Dried thyme (or 2 tsp.
           Minced fresh thyme)
    1/2 ts Dried sage
    1/2 ts Dried basil ( or 1 to 2 tbsp
           Minced fresh basil) ( I used
      2    Tbsp
           Fresh basil -I am glad I
           Did!)
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Unbleached white flour ( I
           Bet wheat flour would be
           Even better)
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
      2 c  Milk ( I used 1% WestSoy,
           Vanilla)
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  optional topping:
  
  2 tsp olive oil or butter ( I sauteed the bell pepper strips down the
  McDougall way with water) 1 small red bell pepper, cut in thin strips
  1 clove garlic, minced minced chives, (I use green onion tops)
  Directions: in original form but with my comments.
  
  1)  Cut the end off the squash, and peel if the skin looks looks
  suspicious in any way. Then cut the squash into 1/4 inch slices and
  set aside. (I used my cuisinart) 2) In a large saucepan or a Dutch
  oven (I used a non-stick pan because I ommitted butter), begin
  sauteing onions and garlic in *butter* over medium heat. After about
  5 minutes, add squash, herbs, and salt. Stir, cover, and continue to
  cook about 10 more minutes. 3) Gradually sprinkle in the flour,
  stirring constantly. Continue to cook and stir over low heat about 5
  minutes. 4) Pour in the white wine, stir briefly, cover, and let
  simmer 10 to 15 minutes. (Note: The alcoholic content of the wine
  dissipates with cooking, and the taste of the wine diminishes
  gradually. So if you let if cook a little longer at this step, you
  will get a more subtle result. Just be sure to stir everything up
  from the bottom from time to time, so it won't stick or scorch.)
  Remove from heat, and allow the soup to cool until it's cool enough
  to puree. 5) Puree the soup with the milk in a food processor or
  blender, and return it to a kettle. At this point, you may choose to
  strain the soup through a fine strainer or a sieve to get a smoother
  texture. (I don't think this is necessary at all) Adjust the
  seasonings. Add black pepper to taste. 6) Heat gently just before
  serving. 7)  While the soup is heating, prepare the optional
  topping.Saute the bell pepper and garlic in olive oil or butter until
  just tender. Spoon a little bit of this into each steaming bowl of
  soup, and sprinkle with minced chives. (my water-sauteed bell pepper
  strips worked just fine)
  
  Prep time: 45 minutes, Yield: 4 to 6 Servings
  
  This recipe is designed primarily for yellow crooked-neck squash ( a
  summer squash), but in the winter you can substitute for acorn and
  butternut.
  
  To freeze yellow crooked-neck squash (so you can use it later in the
  winter), cut the squash into 1/4-inch slices, and drop into a
  saucepan of boiling water for 3 minutes. Drain and cool. Then wrap
  airtight in a plastic bag or container and freeze.
  
  To use acorn or butternut squash in this recipe, peel and seed a 1-lb.
  squash. Chop it into small piecesk and steam or boil until tender.
  Drain well. Then simply follow the recipe, biginning with step 2,
  substituting this cooked winter squash for the yellow crooked neck.

      Title: PURIM MANICOTTI
 Categories: Italian, Holiday, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2    Eggs
    1/8 ts -salt
  1 1/2 c  Flour;unbleached
      1 c  Oil; for frying,olive or
           -other
  1 1/2 c  Honey
 
  Lightly beat eggs and salt together. Gradually add 1 1/4 to 1 1/2
  cups of flour and mix until a rather soft dough is formed. Knead for
  1 minute, then roll out as thin as you can. With a pizza cutter or
  with a very sharp knife, make 24 2"x6" strips. Heat the oil in a
  small frying pan until a piece of dough dropped into it sizzles
  immediately. Holding one strip of dough at one end with your hand,
  plunge the other end of the strip into the hot oil 1 inch deep. At
  once insert the frying part of the strip between the prongs of the
  fork with your other hand. Roll the fork in a counterclockwise motion
  while letting the rest of the strip slide into the oil. The strip
  will fry while it is rolling around the fork. When the manicotto is
  golden, hold it above the pan a few seconds to drip, then gently
  place on a paper towel. Repeat until all the manicotti are done. Heat
  half the honey in a small saucepan. As it starts to boil, drop 2 to 3
  manicotti in it for a few seconds to be coated with honey. Lower the
  heat and continue to dip the manicotti in the hot honey sauce until
  all have been coated, gradually adding additional honey. Cool
  thoroughly before serving. YIELDS: 24

      3 c  Marinara sauce;(Momma's
           -Tomato sauce) or Meat Sauce
 
  Remove the roots and stems from spinach and save for later use. Rinse
  spinach in cold water as many times as necessary to rid it of any
  sand. Place in a pot with no water other than the water the spinach
  retains from washing. Add a pinch of salt and cook, covered for about
  5 minutes. Transfer to a colander and set aside to drain.
    Place oil, onion, carrot and chicken breast in a large skillet. Add
  1 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp pepper and cook over moderate heat for 4 to 5
  minutes longer or until most of the liquid has evaporated. Add flour
  and stir 1 more minute. Remove from heat; cool for 5 or 6 minutes,
  then chop very fine.
    Roll the dough paper thin and place over a floured board. With a
  feather brush dipped in cold water lightly brush the top to maintain
  moisture. Place mounds of spinach mixture on the dough in straight
  lines about 2 inches apart (measurements are from the centers of the
  mounds), making 8 or 9 dozen of them. Roll out the other half of the
  dough paper thin and place loosely over the sheet with the mounds.
  With an Italian pastry wheel, press along the furrows, cutting and
  sealing at the same time.
   Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil. Add ravioli and 3 Tbsp salt. Stir
  until boiling resumes. Cook 4 to 5 minutes, uncovered. Drain and

    100 g  Butter
      1 x  Onion, chopped fine
    1/8 ts Saffron, broken up small

    250 g  Veal, cut into thin strips
      1 dl Heavy cream
      2 x  Tomatoes, skinned and cubed
      1 x  Bunch parsley, chopped fine
 
  Soak the mushrooms, then drain and dry well.  Reserve 2 dl of the
  soaking liquid.  Melt 40 g of the butter in a pan: add the onion,
  mushrooms, garlic and saute quickly; then add the red wine and lower
  the heat so that it's partly absorbed.  Then add the rice and saffron
  and stir well. Add the bouillon and the mushroom-water, stir, and
  reduce heat to a simmer.
   Cook slowly until the liquid is absorbed.  The rice should be al
  dente. -- The butter and grated cheese are tossed in with the risotto
  when it's complete.  -- Flour the veal lightly and saute it in more
  butter; when done, lower the heat and add the cream, stirring
  carefully. Make a "dent" in the middle of the risotto and ladle the
  veal-and-cream mixture into this.  As a garnish, saute the tomatoes
  and parsley in the rest of the butter, and scatter over the top of
  the risotto.
   Serve.

     12 lg Squids
    1/2 lb Ground pork
      3    Green onions, finely sliced
      1    Egg, beaten
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1    Garlic clove, minced
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      1 md Onion, chopped
      1 md Tomato, chopped
    1/2    Bay leaf
      1 tb Soy sauce
 
  Remove squid heads and ink sacs, clean the calamari outside and
  inside. Sprinkle salt lightly on squids and set aside. In a large
  bowl combine ground pork, green onions, beaten egg and a little salt
  and pepper. Stuff squid cavities with meat mixture. This is messy and
  slippery, don't over stuff the calamari as the stuffing will swell
  when cooking. A pastry bag makes this easier to do. Place a pan in a
  steamer and steam the calamari covered for 10-15 minutes, or until
  filling is cooked. Drain liquid and set aside. Prepare sauce while
  steaming calamari. In a skillet over medium heat, saute garlic in oil
  until lightly browned. Add onion and stir for 1 minute. Add tomato,
  bay leaf and soy sauce and cook for 3-5 minutes until tomato pieces
  are soft. Pour sauce on top of stuffed calamari. Serve with rice.
  Note: I save the tentacles from the calamari and as a side dish stir
  fry them with some shrimp and vegetables. I used the broth from
  steaming the calamari as a liquid in this dish. This is NOT a good
  dish to serve to people who don't like calamari or are a bit
  squeamish. Regular bananas can be used but they should be very firm
  and green.

  One of Italy's very special Christmas and New Year's dishes is this
  rich nut-and-fruit pastry, sometimes spelled "Putitza" or "Putizza."
  DISSOLVE THE YEAST in 1/4 cup milk. Add 1/2 cup flour and knead into
  a soft ball. Cover this with a towel and let it rise in a warm place.
  When it has doubled in bulk, add it to a bowl containing the rest of
  the flour, the sugar, eggs, melted butter, pinch of salt and grated
  lemon peel. Mix in enough milk to make a supple dough; knead well.
  Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled in bulk. Put the
  raisins in a small bowl and cover with hot water; let soften, then
  drain. Saute breadcrumbs in 3 tablespoons butter. Finely chop
  walnuts, almonds and candied fruits. In a large bowl, mix together
  the raisins, pignoli, grated lemon and orange peel, chopped nuts and
  fruits, sauteed breadcrumbs and 1 egg yolk. Whip the egg white into
  soft peaks and fold it into the mixture. Preheat oven to 375F. Butter
  a baking sheet. Roll dough into a sheet 1/8-inch thick. Spread
  filling over it, leaving 1 inch clear at the edges. Roll it into a
  cylinder and coil it on the baking sheet like a snail shell. Beat the
  remaining egg yolk in a small bowl and paint the surface of the dough
  with it. Sprinkle it with sugar and bake 35 to 40 minutes, or until
  pastry is firm and golden brown. Makes 1 Loaf

      Title: PUTTING UP YOUR PRESERVES
 Categories: Jams
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           See below
 
  Use 8oz glass jars with two part tops, (lids with screw bands), to
  store the cooked jams and preserves. Select one or two cup glass or
  rigid plastic containers with tight-fitting lids for no cook freezer
  jams and preserves. Wash the jars and glasses with screw bands in an
  automatic dishwasher with very hot rinse water, keep hot until ready
  to use or wash with hot, soapy water and rinse very thoroughly. Place
  the jars and glasses upside down in a large saucepot filled with
  water and bring to boiling and boil for 10 minutes. Keep them hot.
  Was two-part lids in the automatic dishwasher with very hot rinse
  water again, keeping them hot until ready to use or wash in hot soapy
  water and rinse well. Place in a small saucepot filled with water and
  bring to a boil. Remove them from the water but keep them hot until
  ready to use. Fill the jars to within 1/4-inch for the cooked jams
  and 1/2-inch for the no cook freezer jams. Using a plastic knife or
  spatula, make sure there are no air bubbles in the jam. Wipe the jar
  rims and screw threads with a clean damp cloth. Cover with the lids,
  screwing them down tight, and invert the jars for 5 minutes. then
  turn upright. Let the jars stand at room temperature for 1 hour for
  cooked jams or 24 hours for no cook jams. Gently stir no cook jams
  before refrigerating or freezing. ALL JAMS MUST BE FROZEN OR
  REFRIGERATED! Store jams in the freezer for up to 1 year.  Thaw
  frozen jams in the refrigerator.  Thawed jams have a refrigerator
  shelf life of 3 weeks.
  
  NOTE:
  
  With the exception of two of the following recipes (the ones without
  pectin) they may be processed as canned goods by using the
  instructions found in any good cookbook for preserving jellies and
  jams.

      Title: PYRIZHKY (BAKED TURNOVERS)
 Categories: Desserts, Christmas, Russian, Ethnic, Holiday
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
    1/4 lb Butter; 1 Stick
    1/2 c  Sour Cream
      3 lg Egg Yolks
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 lg Egg White; Beaten With A
           -Little Water For Glazing
    1/2 c  Coarse Sugar Crystals;
           -(Optional)
 
  Combine the flour and cold butter in a processor or cut the butter
  with a pastry cutter into coarse crumbs. Add the egg yolks, salt, and
  cream and process or knead lightly until the dough forms a ball. Cut
  in half, wrapping each have in plastic wrap, refrigerate for at least
  2 hours or overnight.  Roll out half the dough on a lightly floured
  work surface, to about 1/4-inch thickness.  Cut into rounds with a
  3-inch cutter or wine glass.  Place a spoonful of the filling on one
  side of each round, fold the top over, brush with a little of the egg
  glaze and seal with a fork or pastry cutter for a fancy edge.  Place
  each turnover on a lightly greased or non-stick baking sheet and
  brush with the glaze then sprinkle with the sugar crystals.  Bake in
  a preheated 375 Degree F. oven for about 20 minutes.  Cool on wire
  racks.
  
  NOTE:
  
  This is a short dough so a non-stick baking sheet would be the best.
  If it is not available, brush as little grease on the sheet as
  possible using a pastry brush or new paint brush.

 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Salt
        pn Sugar
  5 1/2 tb Butter, -chilled
      3 tb Shortning, -chilled
    1/4 c  -ice water
 
     Sift the flour, sugar and salt together into a bowl; add butter and
  shortning and cut them into the dry ingredients with a pastry blender
  or 2 knives until the mixture is like course meal.
     Sprinkle on and blend in enough ice water to make a workable dough,
  mixing water in lightly with a fork.
     Turn dough out onto your work surface and, using the heel of your
  hand, smear the dough away from you, about 1/4 cup at a time. Scrape
  up the smeared dough into a ball, wrap and refrigerate for at least 2
  hours.
     Unwrap dough, place on floured work surface, and pound it a few
  times with your rolling pin to soften it. Roll out 1/8-inch thick, or
  to desired thickness.
     Drape dough over quiche pan or tart pan, ease it into the pan
  without stretching, pat into place, trim off excess, and crimp edge
  if desired. Refrigerate for
       30    minutes.
     Preheat over to 400F.
     Remove chilled dough from refrigerator and prick the bottom and
  sides well with a fork. Line the pan with foil or wax paper; fill
  with beans, rice, or pastry weights to weight the crust. Bake for 10
  minutes, until dough is just beginning to color.
     Remove from oven, remove weights and lining, and cool slightly.
  You now have a partially baked shell which can be filled and rebaked
  for a quiche or a tart.
     For fully baked shell, for fresh fruit tart, for example, remove
  weights and lining from shell after 10 minutes and continue to bake
  until it is golden brown and crisply flaky, about 25 minutes total.
  Cool completely before filling.  [One 11-inch shell or 5-6 small tart
  shells]

  To prepare: 1. Make herb vinaigrette from onion, chives, Italian
  parsley, parsley and a pinch of tarragon, all finely chopped
  together. (Keep some chopped herbs aside to use in chanterelles
  preparation ~ see below.) Add salt, pepper, walnut oil, sherry and
  vinegar, according to taste.
  
  2.  Make truffle juice vinaigrette from bottled truffle juice, salt,
  olive oil and vinegar.  (For both vinaigrettes recommended ratio of
  oil to vinegar is 2:1.)
  
  3.  Cut asparagus tips off stems with slanting cuts (so that they will
  stand up at an angle in central garnish.)
  
  To cook: 1. Lightly salt chanterelles and saute over a low flame in
  butter, with a drop of white wine, a few drops of chicken stock, and
  a mixture of the same herbs that were used to make herb vinaigrette
  (see above).
  
  2.  Reduce sauteed mixture completely, and then marinate chanterelles
  in herb vinaigrette for 30 minutes.
  
  3.  Clean quail breasts and season with salt and pepper. In a
  restaurant kitchen they would be grilled ~ for home cooking, pan-fry
  in hot melted butter quickly for about one minute top and bottom
  until they are golden brown all over.
  
  To present: 1. Create central garnish by arranging a wheel of eleven
  overlapping yellow zucchini slices, placing a small heap of tomato
  brunoise on one central slice. Place asparagus tips pointing outwards
  from centre.
  
  2.  Create three distinct islands of chanterelles topped with frisee
  lettuce and Italian parsley.  Place three truffle slices between
  chanterelle islands and lay one quail breast on each. Pour a little
  truffle juice vinaigrette over quails and central garnish, and a
  little herb vinaigrette over lettuce.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: QUAILS ON MUSHROOMS
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6    Plump young quails
      6    Big flat mushrooms; plus...
      6 oz Mushrooms for the stuffing
      6 oz Butter
      3    Garlic cloves (or more)
           Lemon juice
           Parsley
           Chives
           Tarragon
 
  To make the duxelles, first chop the 6 oz mushrooms plus the stalks
  from the big flat mushrooms on which you will sit the quails. Chop
  finely, using a knife, not a food processor. Mix in 1 very finely
  chopped garlic clove, about 9 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, 3
  tablespoons snipped chives and 1 heaped tablespoon fresh tarragon (or
  a generous 1 1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon if fresh is not available).
  Cook the mixture in a little butter over moderate heat for 3 minutes
  or so, stirring often. Season well with salt, pepper and about 2
  teaspoons lemon juice.
  
  Let the duxelles cool before using it to stuff the birds. Spread it
  gently between the flesh and the skin, all over the breast area, to
  plump up the quails prettily. Secure the flap of neck skin under each
  bird with a wooden toothpick.  If the skin is torn, put the stuffing
  into the body cavities instead.  Tie up the legs of each bird to keep
  it neatly shaped.
  
  Make about 5 oz garlic butter and reserve it.  Choose a roasting tin
  or baking dish just large enough to take the 6 flat mushrooms side by
  side.
  
  When ready to cook, melt a nugget of the garlic butter in the
  roasting tin. Turn the birds in it to coat them with fat, then
  arrange them, breast down, on a rack suspended across the roasting
  tin. Bake at 425 F (220 C) gas mark 7 for 15 minutes.
  
  Put the mushrooms in the tin, arranging them gill side up, and dot
  them with the rest of the garlic butter. Put the rack of quails back
  on top of the tin and turn the birds breast side up. Position the
  birds carefully, placing each one above a mushroom so that the meat
  juices will drip on to the mushrooms during cooking. Bake for 20
  minutes or so until the birds and mushrooms are perfectly cooked.
  
  Sit the birds on the mushrooms and serve straight away, or cover and
  keep hot at 250 F (120 C) gas mark 1/2 until ready to serve. Rice,
  couscous or burghul, and crisp peppery watercress go well with this
  dish.
