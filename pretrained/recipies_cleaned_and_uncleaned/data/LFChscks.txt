                        ***CRUST***
  20                    vanilla wafers
                        --2 1/2 ounces
   1      tablespoon    canola oil
                        ***FILLING***
   2 1/2  cups          low-fat cottage cheese
  12      ounces        reduced-fat cream cheese -- softened
                        --notnonfat
     2/3  cup           granulated sugar
     1/3  cup           packed light brown sugar
     1/4  cup           cornstarch
   1      large         egg
   2      large         egg whites
   1      cup           non-fat plain yogurt
   3      tablespoons   bourbon -- optional
   1 1/2  teaspoons     pure vanilla extract
                        --2 1/2 teaspoons if not using bourbon
                        ***PECAN PRALINE TOPPING***

     1/3  cup           water
     1/4  cup           finely chopped pecans

TO MAKE CRUST:

1. Preheat oven to 325°F. Lightly oil a 9-inch springform pan or coat it with nonstick spray. Put a kettle of water on to heat for the water bath. Wrap outside of pan with a double thickness of foil to prevent water from seeping in.

2. In a food processor, finely grind vanilla wafers. Add oil and process until well combined. Press into bottom of pan.

TO MAKE FILLING:

1. In a food processor, puree cottage cheese until smooth, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl. Add cream cheese, granulated and brown sugars and cornstarch. Process until smooth. Add egg, egg whites, yogurt, bourbon, if using, and vanilla; process until smooth. Pour over crust.

2. Place cheesecake in a shallow roasting pan and pour in enough boiling water to come 1/2 inch up the outside of the springform pan. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until edges are set but center still jiggles when pan is tapped.

3. Turn off oven. Spray a knife with nonstick spray and run it around the inside edge of the pan. Let cheesecake stand in the oven, with door ajar, for 1 hour. Remove cheesecake from water bath and transfer to a wire rack; let cool. Refrigerate, uncovered, until chilled; cover with plastic wrap. (The cheesecake will keep, covered, in the refrigeratorfor up to 2 days.)

4. Just before serving, sprinkle cheesecake with Pecan Praline Topping.

Pecan Praline Topping:

1. Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat it with non-stick spray.

Increase heat to medium-high and cook, without stirring, until syrup turns medium amber, 3 to 5 minutes. Immediately remove from heat and stir in pecans. Pour onto prepared baking sheet, spreading in a thin layer. Let stand until praline is cool and brittle.

3. Slide a metal spatula under praline to loosen it from pan; crack into small pieces. Place in a food processor and pluse until coarsely crushed or ground. (The praline will keep, tightly covered, at room temperature for up to 3 days.)

Makes 1 cup.
