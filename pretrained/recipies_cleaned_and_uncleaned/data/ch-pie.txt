Chocolate Caramel Hazelnut Pie

pies

1  prebaked 9 pie shell
      ----FILLING----
1 1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces
1 can evaporated milk (5 oz)
2 oz unsweetened chocolate, chopped
2 cup hazelnuts or filberts, skinned and; coarsely chopped
      ----OPTIONAL DECORATION----
8  whole hazelnuts, skinned
24  sliced almonds

From "The Artful Pie", Lisa Cherasky & Renee Comet (Chapters
Publishing).

Filling preparation: First, prepare the pie shell. Then, in a large,
heavy-bottomed saucepan, stir together the sugar and water. Set the
saucepan over medium-high heat. Let the sugar mixture come to a boil
and continue to cook until it caramelizes. Do not stir the sugar as
it cooks. If it caramelizes unevenly, you can move it around by
swirling it in the pan. When the sugar is a rich golden brown, remove
it from heat and stir in the butter and evaporated milk gradually,
mixing well with a wooden spoon until smooth. Let cool for 5 minutes
and stir in the chocolate. Beat with a whisk until very smooth. Set
the filling aside to cool for 10-15 minutes and then stir in the
nuts. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 475'F.

Assembly and baking: Pour the filling into the pie shell and bake for
10 minutes, until the edge is very brown and the center is bubbling.
Once the pie has cooled to room temperature, about 1 hour, decorate
it, if desired, by making small flowers with the whole hazelnuts and
sliced almonds.

Makes one 9" single-crust pie.

Chocolate-Hazelnut Filling          2 c  whole Hazelnuts The already

refrigerate. Cooking the Chocolate-Hazelnut Filling.
Place the hazelnuts on a baking pan and toast at 350 degree F until the
skins are loose and come off easily, about 10 minutes.  Rub the hazelnuts
in a towel to remove the skins. Chop the hazelnuts coarsely, by hand or
with a food processor. Combine the chocolate with the butter in a small
bowl.  Bring a small pan of water to a simmer and turn off the heat. Place
the bowl of chocolate and butter over the hot water and stir to melt.
Combine the corn syrup and sugar in a small saucepan. Bring to a full
rolling boil over medium heat. Remove from heat and stir in the chocolate
mixture. Beat the eggs and salt with the optional rum. Beat in the
chocolate mixture, taking care not to overbeat. Assembling. Lightly flour
the work surface and dough. Roll the dough to a 14-inch diameter disk, 1/8
inch thick. Line a 10-inch tart pan with the dough, trimming away the
excess. Stir the chipped hazelnuts into the filling and pour the filling
into the pan. Baking. Bake at 350 degree F until the filling is set and the
crust is baked through, about 40 minutes. Holding. Store the tart at room
temperature up to 2 days.

Chocolate Hearts

chocolate, pastries

1/2 lb bittersweet chocolate
1  raspberry coulis (separate recipe f; ollows)
1  creme anglaise (separate recipe fol; lows)
1  chocolate mousse (separate recipe f; ollows)
1  royal icing (separate recipe follow; s)

1. To temper chocolate, cut off one third; set aside. Break remainder
into small pieces, and melt in a dry metal bowl over simmering water.
When chocolate reaches 100' on a chocolate thermometer, remove from
wa- ter bath and add reserved chocolate. Stir until chocolate cools
to 85'; remove unmelted pieces. Place over hot water again, and stir
until chocolate reaches 90'.

2. Brush 8 heart-shaped molds with chocolate, a thin layer at a time.
Make shells as thin as possible but sturdy enough for filling.

3. Place molds in freezer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until chocolate
begins to separate from mold. Without touching chocolate, turn shells
out onto a parchment-covered baking sheet. Refrigerate until ready to
fill.

4. Pour a thin laver of raspberry coulis onto dessert plates. Pour
creme anglaise into a small parchment-paper pastry bag, and cut a
tiny hole at the end. Dot perimeter of coulis with creme anglaise. In
one circular motion, lightly drag a wooden skewer through dots to
make heart shapes.

5. Using a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip, pipe mousse into
each shell, piling high. Carefully place a second shell on top.

6. Decorate tops of hearts as desired with royal icing, using a
pastry bag with a small star tip. Refrigerate. Set hearts out at room
temperature 20 minutes before serving.

Chocolate Meringue Pie

pies, chocolate

1  pie shell, 9; baked
1/2 cup cocoa, dutch process unsweetened
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 1/2 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
3  egg; separated
2 cup milk
2 teaspoon vanilla (not extract)
2 tablespoon butter
      ----MERINGUE----
3  egg white
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla (not extract)
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 teaspoon baking powder
2/3 cup sugar

Pie:  Combine dry ingredients in a medium saucepan and stir to mix
thor- oughly before you add liquids.  Now add egg yolks (save the
whites for the meringue) and milk and whisk until there are
absolutely no lumps. Place directly over medium-low heat, stir
CONSTANTLY until the pudding thickens and comes to a plopping boil.
Watch it like a hawk and DON'T TURN UP THE FIRE; at this stage it'll
stick and burn at the least provocation! Patience is essential here.
Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla and butter. Pour into baked
pie shell. Top with meringue. Bake at 325 F. until the meringue
browns, 15 to 20 minutes.

Meringue:  Beat egg whites and all other ingredients except sugar
until foamy.  Add sugar, ONE TABLESPOON AT A TIME, while beating
vigorously until the whites will hold a firm peak and are satiny
looking. Spread meringue over the hot filling, starting with small
amounts at the edges and sealing to the crust all around. If you
don't make sure the meringue is well stuck to the crust at this
stage, it'll shrink and pull away during the baking, which makes a
lots less attractive pie. Spread pie with remaining meringue, making
hills and valleys.

Adding the sugar a little at a time helps make sure that it dissolves
completely, and so helps prevent the meringue from weeping. Also,
spreading the meringue over the hot filling helps--I don't know why.

Chocolate Mousse Pie -1

pies, chocolate, pastries

1 1/4 cup chocolate wafer crumbs
1/2 cup melted butter; or margarine ----mousse--
8 oz semisweet chocolate; finely ground
1 oz unsweetened chocolate; finely ground
4 oz heavy whipping cream
6 tablespoon unsalted butter
2  eggs; separated
1  bailey's irish cream; optional

Recipe by: Tracy McCulloch Add butter to crumbs just until it will hold its
shape when pressed into a pan. I'm sorry but I've never bothered to measure
the butter!

MOUSSE:

Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks forms.  Set aside. Heat the cream and
medium heat.  When the butter is well-incorporated into the cream, add the
chocolates.Stir off the heat until melted and well-blended. Add the egg
yolks.

Quickly fold 1/4 of the chocolate mixture into the beaten whites, then fold
the whites into the chocolate.

Fill the crust with the filling and refrigerate several hours.  If you like
may add Bailey's Irish Cream to the filling to flavour and whip cream with
a tiny bit of sugar and some Frangelico liqueur.  Amaretto for the whipping
cream is also nice.  It's just a decadent final touch to an alread-decadent
dessert.

least 2 hours.  Using a fork, mash one-third of the
strawberries; toss again, then add raspberries and
cherries.  Let stand 1 hour.  Adjust rack to lower
third of oven; preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line a
large baking sheet with parchment paper.

DOUGH:  Sift the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking
powder, baking soda and salt into a large bowl.

Combine the egg, buttermilk, milk and orange zest in a
small bowl; stir to mix.  Cut the butter into the dry
ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse meal.
Add the egg mixture and stir just until it forms a
soft and moist, sticky dough.

Spoon 1/4-cup mounds of dough about 2 inches apart on
the baking sheet. Sprinkle a small amount of sugar
over each mound and gently pat dough to 1/2- to
3/4-inch thickness.  (After patting, shortcakes should
be about 1 inch apart.)  Bake about 20 minutes, or
until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out
clean. Remove shortcakes to a wire rack to cool. (You
may freeze the shortcakes in a sturdy container for up
to 2 weeks.)

TOPPING:  Whip cream with the sugar and vanilla until
soft peaks form.

ASSEMBLY:  Split the shortcakes in half horizontally,
preferably with the tines of a fork. Place the bottom
halves on dessert plates. Top each with berries and
cherries, then with whipped cream. Set the top of
shortcakes on the whipped cream.  If desired, sprinkle
with a light dusting of powdered sugar. Serves 12.
