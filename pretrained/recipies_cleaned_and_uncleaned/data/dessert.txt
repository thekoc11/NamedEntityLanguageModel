    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Shortening
      5 tb ICE Water
      8 c  Apples [peeled & sliced]

  in the water a little at a time, using a fork, and form the dough into a
  ball.

  12" diameter and fit into a 9" pie pan fluting the edges.

  mixture and arrange them in the pie crust.
  
  To make the topping: 4) Combine the sugar and flour in a bowl and cut in
  the butter using a pastry cutter then sprinkle the topping over the apple
  filling.
  
  5) Place the pie in the LARGE paper bag and place the paper bag on a baking
  sheet and loosely fold the open end of the bag under. Bake until the apples
  are tender (50-60 minutes).
  
  6) Carefully remove the pie from the bag ~ CAUTION: WATCH OUT FOR THE STEAM
  COMING OUT OF THE BAG!

  1 1/4 c  Cream, heavy
      2    Bananas (or equivalent
           -amount of soft fruit)
           Broken meringue
 
  Whip the cream.  Chop fruit coarsely, but don't crush.  Break meringue into
  large crumbs.  Mix everything shortly before serving and pile into glasses.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Simple dessert for failed Pavlova attempts -- My mother used to make the
  banana variety of this when she cooked her meringues a little too long or
  too hot. I've no idea of its origins.
  
  *  I can never make up my mind whether I prefer the strawberry or the
  banana version. Peach should be pretty good too, though I've never tried
  it.
  
  *  This is a neat way of saving a Pavlova attempt when the meringue part
  fails:  it produces a delicious desert and no-one need ever know...
  
  : Difficulty:  very simple.
  : Time:  10 minutes presuming you have the meringue available.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      1 c  Brown sugar
      3 T  All purpose flour
           -
           -Speck of salt
      1    12 oz can evaporated milk
  2 1/2 T  Butter
           -Ground cinnamon
 
  Preheat oven to 350 F.  In the pie shell, place the brown sugar, flour, and
  salt.  Mix with your fingers.  Pour the evaporated milk over the flour and
  sugar, but do not stir or mix this in.  Dot with butter, and drift cinnamon
  liberally over all.  Bake for 50 min., or until the filling just bubbles up
  in the middle. The filling will never completely set, but that's the way
  it's supposed to be. This pie is better eaten at room temperature. If you
  refrigerate leftovers, reheat them in the oven before serving. NOTE: Recipe
  can be doubled and prepared in a 10 inch pie shell. For that size, bake 1
  hour and 20 min.  (Yield: 12 servings)

    1/4 ts Cream of tartar
 
  Beat together the powdered sugar and peanut butter until the mixture is
  crumbly; set aside. In a large, heavy saucepan, combine 2/3 c sugar and 2
  cup milk; heat to scalding or until bubbles start to form on the bottom. Do
  not let it boil.
  
  Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, beat the egg yolks to mix; blend in 3 T
  cornstarch, flour and salt. Stir to make a paste. Whisk in the remaining 1
  cup cold milk, whisking until the mixture is smooth. Pour in some of the
  hot milk mixture, stirring to combine.
  
  Add mixture in bowl to the milk in the saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat,
  stirring constantly, until the mixture bubbles up in the center. Add the
  butter and 1 t vanilla. Remove from heat and let custard cool. Preheat oven
  to 350 degrees. Sprinkle 2/3 of the crumbly peanut butter mixture in the
  bottom of the baked (and cooled) pastry shell. Pour the cooled custard
  mixture over the top.
  
  In a large mixer bowl, place the egg whites, cream of tartar and remaining
  1 teaspoon vanilla. Beat until stiff peaks form. Gradually, while beating,
  add the 4 tablespoons remaining sugar and 3 T remaining cornstarch.
  Continue beating until whites are very think and glossy. Spread on top of
  pie; sprinkle the remaining peanut butter mixture on top.
  
  Bake for 10 to 15 minutes; watching carefully, or until the meringue is
  golden brown. Cool.

      Title: Apple Crumb Pie
 Categories: Usenet, Pies & past
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
      4 c  Apples, tart
      2 T  Butter
    3/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 t  Nutmeg
      1 t  Cinnamon
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
    1/4 c  Flour, all-purpose
    1/4 c  Butter, melted
    1/2 c  Nuts, chopped
           -(walnuts, pecans, etc.)
      1    Pie crust
 
  Core, peel and slice the apples.  Melt the butter and mix the rest in with
  it. Pour over apples and mix around so the apples are coated. Put in an
  unbaked pie shell.
  
  Combine brown sugar, flour, melted butter and nuts.  Spread over top of the
  filling.  Bake at 375 degrees F. for 50 minutes, or until it is bubbling.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  One-crust apple-crumb pie -- The pie can also be frozen and then baked,
  right from the freezer, at 360 for 90 minutes.  The pies will keep a very
  long time in the freezer and not be worse for wear.
  
  *  PS:  For those who like the quality of home-made pie crusts but the
  convenience of ready-made, make a bunch of crusts someday when the mood
  grabs you, and put them in the freezer in a big plastic bag.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

  Contributed to the echo by: Cheryl Johns Originally from "Sweet Vidalia
  Onions - Blue Ribbon Recipes" Okay, folks, our favorite time of year has
  come. The Vidalia onions have reached Virgina. I just bought a 10 pound bag
  and a cookbook called Sweet Vidalia Onions - Blue Ribbon Recipes. I'll post
  a few recipes tonight that I think look interesting. Remember I just got
  the book tonight so I haven't tried any of them. Peel, core and slice
  apples into 1/4 inch slices. Peel and thinly slice onions. Layer the onion
  slices in a buttered 9 1/2 inch pyrex pie plate. Put a layer of apples on
  onion slices, another layer of onions, ending with apples. Pour one cup of
  bouillon over the layers, then sprinkle cracker crumbs on top. Drizzle
  melted butter over the crumbs. Bake in oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes
  or until top has browned.

  Melt butter in a 9x13 pan.  Add noodles.
  
  Combine remaining ingredients, except crumbs, spread evenly over noodles.
  Top with crumbs. Bake at 350 degrees F. for about an hour.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Noodle kugel using uncooked noodles -- This recipe is interesting
  because you don't cook the noodles first. Yield: Serves 6.
  
  *  This recipe is very simple, but it does taste a little pastier than
  recipes that require the noodles to be cooked first.  It also comes out
  very flat -- most of the kugel recipes I've made in the past use twice as
  many noodles in the same size pan. I found that some of the things can be
  increased, i.e., add more noodles, more pineapple, more cottage cheese.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: Baklava
 Categories: Desserts, Balkan, Usenet
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
-----------------------------------DOUGH-----------------------------------
      1 lb Strudel dough
           -(or fillo leaves)
      1 lb Butter, unsalted,
           -well-melted (salted
           -butter (or margarine)
           -is not acceptable)

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      1 lb Walnut meat,
           -chopped medium-fine
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 t  Vanilla (or use
           -vanilla sugar)

-----------------------------------SYRUP-----------------------------------
      4 c  Sugar
      2 c  Water
      1 t  Lemon juice
 
  Heat oven to 300 degrees F. to 325 degrees F.
  
  MAKE THE SYRUP:  Boil the water and sugar for 15 minutes.  Add lemon juice,
  boil 10 more minutes, set aside to cool.
  
  MAKE THE FILLING:  Mix all ingredients well.  I prefer the walnuts fairly
  coarse; some people like them quite fine.
  
  BUILD THE BAKLAVA:  Cut the dough with scissors to the size of the tray.
  Handle the dough very carefully; do not press hard on it at any time. Cover
  with wax paper and damp towel.
  
  Take out one sheet of dough at a time and place it in the pan.  Brush the
  dough with melted butter between each layer.  Continue until you have about
  12 sheets buttered. Small and broken pieces of dough can be used in the
  center, but there must be butter between every two layers.
  
  Spread walnut filling across the tray.  Put on a sheet of dough, brush on
  butter and continue until all the dough is used up.
  
  Cut into diamond shapes:  cut into quarters with cuts parallel to the long
  axis, then cut diagonally across.  Don't press hard!
  
  Bake for about 1 1/2 hour, until golden brown.  Be careful not to burn the
  bottom or the walnuts, especially with a glass pan.
  
  Let cool on rack for 5 minutes.  Add syrup which should have cooled to room
  temperature.  Let cool for at least two hours before eating.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An incredibly sweet and wonderful Balkan dessert -- Baklava is claimed
  by almost every Balkan state as its own invention; most people in the
  United States first encounter it in Greek restaurants. If the truth were
  known, it's probably the Turkish who invented it, as is the case for many
  other "typically Greek" dishes. This recipe comes from my Bulgarian
  grandmother and follows Bulgarian tradition, in that the filling is very
  simple.  Yield:  Makes two small pans.
  
  *  Probably the hardest thing about this recipe is waiting those last two
  hours!
  
  *  Depending on where you go, you'll hear the name of this dish pronounced
  different ways.  I pronounce the name with all /ah/ sounds, with accents of
  equal intensity on both the first and third syllable. The second syllable
  is quite faint. Greek-speaking persons typically put a heavy accent on the
  second syllable.
  
  *  Many variations on the filling are to be found.  A simple one was
  mentioned above, regarding the coarseness of grind of the walnuts in the
  filling. They may even be ground. Spices such as chopped cloves or cinnamon
  may be added and the filling may be included in several layers instead of
  just one.
  
  *  A large (14 x 10 inch) pan is almost too big to handle.  I typically
  make this recipe in two 7 3/4 x 11 inch pans, which is just about the size
  of a half sheet of the dough I buy. By the way, if you can make your own
  strudel dough, it will be even better... but much more effort.
  
  *  It is best to have a partner help you prepare the pans.  One person
  handles the dough and places it in the pan, while the other applies the
  butter. It is very important that sufficient butter be placed between
  layers so that each layer gets flaky, rather than having them stick
  together.  Pay particular attention to the edges and corners.
  
  *  In case you haven't noticed, this is very sweet stuff.  It goes great
  with a fine cup of coffee, espresso, or Turkish coffee, even with sugar.
  Two pieces will probably fill anyone up; it refrigerates and freezes quite
  well. This recipe requires a lot of effort, but it's well worth it.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate to hard.
  : Time:  1 1/2 hours preparation, 1 1/2 hours cooking, 2 hours cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

  +------------------------------ FILLING ~--------------------------------
  +------------------------------ MERINGUE ~--------------------------------
  To make pastry, combine flour, sugar and butter in a food processor.
  Process until the consistency of fine meal. Add beaten egg; continue to
  process just until dough starts to come together. Gather into a ball, wrap
  and refrigerate for one hour or place in freezer for 15 minutes to chill.
  Roll out dough on a floured surface or roll out between two sheets of
  plastic wrap to an 11-inch circle. Dough is sticky and falls apart easily;
  just patch together and fit into a nine-inch flan pan with removable
  bottom; trim edges. (If you don't have a flan pan, a pie plate can be
  used.) Chill for 30 minutes. Bake pastry at 375 degrees for 12 minutes
  until light golden in color. Thinly slice five of the bananas and arrange
  on bottom of pastry shell. Mash the remaining banana and combine with warm
  cream, 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch and vanilla. Pour over banana layer. Bake
  at 350 degrees for 35 - 40 minutes or until filling is set. Let pie cool
  slightly. To make meringue, beat egg whites with a pinch of salt until soft
  peaks form. Gradually beat in 1/3 cup sugar until meringue is stiff and
  glossy. Spread meringue over warm pie; bake at 350 degrees for 12 - 15
  minutes or until browned. Let cool; refrigerate until serving time. Serves

 Categories: Pies & past
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
  1 1/4 c  Flour
           Pinch of salt
      3 T  Butter
      3 T  Shortening
      3    To 4 Tb. cold water
 
       Sift the flour and salt together into a bowl.  But the butter and
  shortening into the flour with a pastry blender or two knives until the
  mixture resembles course meal.  Add three Tb. water and mix with a fork and
  then with your fingertips until the dough can be gathered into a ball.
   If the dough is very crumbly, sprinkle a few drops of water over the
  dough, adding only enough to make the dough stick together.  Wrap the dough
  in wax paper and chill in the refriigerator one hour before rolling out.
  
  ROLLING AND PRE-BAKING : Roll the dough out on a floured board and fit it
  into a nine to ten inch quiche tin or nine inch pie plate. Cover the pastry
  with a sheet of aluminum floil, pressing it firmly around the sides and
  over the edges of the pastry.  Fill with uncooked rice or dry beans and
  bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 7 minutes. Carefully remove the
  rice or beans and aluminum foil. Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork
  and continue baking 5 minutes more. The crust should not brown but should
  be only partially baked unless otherwise directed in a specific recipe. Let
  the pastry cool before filling and baking the quiche or pie.

      Title: Berry Cobbler
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Sugar (for sprinkling)
      4 c  Berries (fresh or frozen)
      1 c  Sugar (for the batter)
      1 c  Flour, all-purpose
  1 1/2 t  Baking powder
    1/2 t  Salt
    1/2 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Butter (softened)
           Nutmeg
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Sprinkle about 1/2 cup of sugar on the
  berries and place them in the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish. Combine the
  remaining dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder and salt).
  
  Add the milk and softened butter and beat well.  Spoon the batter over the
  berries.  Sprinkle some nutmeg on top.  Bake for about 45 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Berry cobbler -- This recipe was lifted from _TV Guide's_ series of
  recipes from television stars. It is similar to the recipe for Berry
  Pudding found in Edna Staebler's "Food That Really Schmecks" cookbook.
  
  *  You can use pretty well any type of berry for the base.  A favourite of
  mine is a combination of strawberries, raspberries and blueberries.
  
  *  The base of this turns out to be a bit thin and liquidy.  If you strain
  the juice from the fruit, add a couple of tablespoons of flour to the
  juice, and then pour the juice over the fruit in the baking dish, the base
  will be semi-firm.
  
  *  You do not need to sprinkle the full 1/2 cup of sugar on the berries;
  with sweeter berries, much less will often suffice.
  
  *  If you would like a sweeter, candy-like batter, try adding more sugar to
  the batter.  I wouldn't recommend putting more than about 1 1/4 cups of
  sugar into the batter, though, the crust of the batter will be very
  candy-like, but the centre of the batter will not properly bake if you do.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 45 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

  The original recipe for this rich tart called for a yeasty pastry into
  which was folded butter. As with the Selkirk Bannock the dough for this
  would have been a portion from the weekly bread making. Nowadays a rich
  shortcrust pastry is used.
  
  To make the pastry: Rub the butter into the flour, stir in the sugar and
  bind the mixture to make a firm dough. Line an 8-inch flan ring and reserve
  the extra dough for decoration.
  
  To make the custard: Blend the cornflour with a little milk and stir in the
  remaining milk and sugar. Heat gently until it boils and simmer for a
  couple of moments before removing from the heat. Stir in the butter and let
  the custard cool a little before stirring in the egg yolk and vanilla
  essence. Leave it to cool.
  
  To make the filling: Roll the marzipan to fit the base of the pastry.
  Sprinkle over the almonds and peel. Spread the cooled custard over this.
  Using the left over rolled pastry, cut circles of about 1-inch in diameter
  and arrange these in a pattern on top of the custard.
  
  Cover with a circle of greaseproof paper to prevent burning the custard and
  bake for 20 minutes at 400øF / 200øC / gas mark 6 and then for a further 20
  minutes in a slower oven, 350øF / 180øC / gas mark 4.
  
  Decorate by combining 1 ounce icing sugar with a little warm water and
  spreading over the pastry circles. Serve either hot and cold.
  
  This is a very rich tart and I find the iced pastry circles detract from
  the otherwise subtle splendour of this treat. Even a latticed decoration
  seems to heavy for modern tastes. Try a very light shake of nutmeg or
  cinnamon or decorate with a few flaked almonds instead. ** Scottish Home

      Title: Busy Day Cobbler
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Butter (or margarine,
           -if you must)
    1/2 c  Sugar
    2/3 c  Milk
      1 c  Flour
      2 t  Baking powder
     13 oz Tart cherries
           -(one normal U.S. can)
      2 T  Sugar (to sweeten
           -and thicken; use less
           -or more as needed)
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Drain cherries, saving liquid.
  
  Cream butter and sugar together.  Alternately add in milk and sifted dry
  ingredients.  Pour into a buttered and floured casserole dish. Top evenly
  with cherries.  Sprinkle sugar on top and cover with saved liquid/juice.
  Bake 45-50 minutes.
  
  The batter will expand and surround the cherries so they're evenly mixed
  throughout the cobbler.  The juice will congeal to fruity and pudding-like.
  Serve warm topped with cream, milk or ice cream.  (I prefer milk). If any
  is left, it's good cold, too.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An extremely quick cherry cobbler dessert -- This recipe came from a PTA
  recipe collection from my Aunt's school a number of years ago. It's not a
  true, classic cobbler, but I think it's better.  My favorite dessert!
  
  *  As the name implies, this is a very quick recipe to make. Depending on
  how soft the butter is to start with, or whether or if you use a food
  processor (I don't, but it should work) this recipe takes only 5 to 10
  minutes to mix.
  
  *  You can use any unsweetened canned fruit for this recipe.  You can also
  use frozen fruit, by thawing it before adding to the pan. Berries or
  peaches are standard substitutes. Yesterday I made one with crushed
  pineapple.  I used brown, rather than white sugar atop the fruit. It tasted
  very much like pineapple upside down cake (though the appearance was a bit
  different).
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, I've been making this since I was about 8 or 9.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: Butter Cookies
 Categories: Cookies, Usenet
      Yield: 2 Dozen
 
    1/2 c  Butter (unsalted),
           -at room temperature
    1/2 c  Sugar, granulated
  1 1/2 c  Flour, white
      1 lg Egg
      1 t  Vanilla extract
  1 1/2 t  Baking powder
 
  Beat the butter with the sugar.  Add the egg and vanilla and beat until you
  get a uniform mixture.  Mix the flour and baking powder and gradually blend
  them into the mixture.  When you're done, you should have a rather sticky
  dough.
  
  Shape the dough into balls, about 1 inch in diameter.  Roll them in sugar
  and place them on an ungreased cookie sheet, leaving about an inch of space
  between cookies, so that they don't stick together when they expand.
  
  Bake in preheated oven at 350 degrees F. for 20 minutes.  Remove from oven,
  let them cool for a while, and start eating right away.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  After reading the ingredients on a can of imported Danish butter
  cookies, I thought: "Hey! I can do this myself!", so I developed the
  following recipe. It doesn't resemble the original too much, but
  considering that the cookies don't stay around for more than two days, and
  that even my mother liked them, they must be good! Yield: Makes 2-3 dozen
  cookies.
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 20 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

  sugar syrup. North Americans can substitute dark corn syrup or a mixture of
  molasses and water.

----------------------------------COOKIES----------------------------------
      1 c  Brown sugar
    1/2 t  Salt
    1/2 c  Butter, softened
      1    Egg
    1/2 t  Vanilla
  1 3/4 c  Flour, sifted
    1/2 t  Baking powder
    1/4 t  Baking soda
    1/4 t  Cinnamon

-----------------------------------GLAZE-----------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Confectioner's sugar
      1    Egg white,
           -slightly beaten
      1 T  Butter, melted
    1/8 t  Salt
    1/2 t  Vanilla
           Food coloring
           -(optional)
 
  Mix sugar, salt and butter thoroughly.  Add egg and vanilla and beat till
  fluffy.
  
  Sift flour, baking powder, soda and cinnamon and add to mixture. Chill
  well, several hours, or overnight.
  
  MAKE THE GLAZE:  Mix the glaze ingredients together until smooth.
  
  Roll the dough out until it is about 1/8 inch thick.  Cut into fancy shapes
  and bake on ungreased cookie sheet for 8-10 minutes at 350 degrees F. Let
  cool and glaze.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Rolled cookies for the Christmas holidays -- I almost never make these
  cookies except at Christmas time.  They just seem to be Christmas cookies.
   (I did make a batch of heart shaped ones last Valentine's day for my
  then-fiance.)  I usually make these cookies in  Christmas shapes and frost
  them with green and red frosting.  This is a good recipe for kids to help
  out with.
  
  *  It helps to keep most of the dough in the refrigerator while you are
  cutting shapes.  It cuts much better when it is cold.
  
  *  These are time-consuming and fairly difficult, but worth it.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, overnight chill, 1 hour cutting and
  baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      6 T  Butter, melted
      2 T  Sugar, white
    1/2 t  Cinnamon, ground

--------------------------------CAKE FILLING--------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Cream cheese
    3/4 c  Sugar
      3    Eggs
    1/4 c  Lemon juice
      2 t  Lemon rind, grated
      2 t  Vanilla

----------------------------------TOPPING----------------------------------
      2 c  Sour cream
      3 T  Sugar
      1 t  Vanilla

-----------------------------------GLAZE-----------------------------------
    1/2 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 t  Cornstarch
    1/4 t  Salt
    3/4 c  Water
    1/3 c  Lemon juice
      1    Egg yolk, WELL BEATEN
      1 T  Butter
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Combine crust ingredients.  Press crust on
  bottom and sides of buttered 10-inch springform pan.  Bake 5 minutes and
  cool.
  
  Beat cheese until soft.  Add sugar and blend well.  Add eggs, one at a
  time, beating well after each. Mix in the lemon rind and the vanilla, and
  add to the mixture. Pour into the pre-baked crust and bake 35 minutes.
  
  Combine topping ingredients, spread on top of cheesecake, and return to
  oven immediately. Bake 10-12 minutes and remove from oven.
  
  Combine dry glaze ingredients; add liquid glaze ingredients.  Cook over low
  heat until thick.  Add about 1 T of butter.  Cool and spread this glaze on
  the cake before the glaze thickens too much.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Legendary cheesecake -- This is from a dessert-chef friend of a
  regular-chef friend and apparently won some award.  I've had cheesecakes
  that I think are more impressive (including one I can make), but I think
  I'm something of a cheesecake connoisseur. If I want to blow people's socks
  off, this is the one I cook. I think that every time I've served it to a
  new group, at least one person has said "That was the best cheesecake I've
  ever had."
  
  *  Some pointers:  this is the traditional crust, but I often use a more
  floury-baked-pie-crust-like one.  It's not too critical.  The magic to
  getting the texture perfect is in how you beat the cheese. I use a kitchen
  aid, work slowly, scrape the bowl often, and ALWAYS USE ROOM TEMPERATURE
  EVERYTHING. Using cold cream cheese guarantees lumps. Don't beat too hard
  before putting in the sugar, but make sure it's even and fluffy before the
  eggs go in. Then again, don't over-beat. It takes practice.
  
  *  I've been known to make it with no sugar or vanilla in the topping, and
  I think it's more interesting. but the contrast between the layers may
  confuse those accustomed to restaurant cheesecakes.
  
  *  The glaze is easy as glazes go, but treat it properly.  In particular,
  stir constantly until it's thick, but don't stir hard or you'll break down
  the starch.
  
  : Difficulty:  rather difficult (timing is critical.)
  : Time:  1 hour.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

      Title: Cheesecake (Belgian)
 Categories: Cheesecakes, Usenet
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
-----------------------------------CRUST-----------------------------------
      2 c  Rolled oats (do not
           -use instant oatmeal
           -or steel-cut oats)
    2/3 c  Brown sugar
    1/2 c  Butter, unsalted
           -(at room temperature)

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
     11 oz Cream cheese
           -(at room temperature)
      3    Eggs
    3/4 c  Cottage cheese,
           -small-curd
      1 t  Vanilla extract
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Mix crust ingredients with your hands until
  well blended.  Put the mixture in a 9-inch springform pan and form a crust,
  pushing it about 1 1/2 inches up the sides of the pan. Bake the crust about
  10 minutes at 350 degrees F. and let it cool.
  
  Beat (or mix) the filling ingredients, at very high speed, for seven
  minutes. The mixture must be very smooth. Put the filling in the baked
  crust.  You may want to re-form the crust slightly first.
  
  Bake for 35-40 minutes at 350 degrees F.  The cheesecake is done when the
  filling is firm, but not dark (burned) on top.  Let it cool, then chill it.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A moist cheesecake with a wonderful crust -- A college friend gave me
  this recipe, oh so many moons ago. It comes from his parents, and may have
  roots in Belgium. It is very different from the typical New-York-style dry
  cheesecake.  Yield:  Serves 6-8.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 40 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

      Title: Cherry Cream Cheese Pie
 Categories: Usenet, Pies & past
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
      1    Pie shell
           -(graham cracker)
      8 oz Cream cheese
    1/2 c  Sour cream
    1/3 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 t  Vanilla (or to taste)
      4 oz Whipped cream
     14 oz Cherry pie filling
           -(1 can)
 
  Cream together the cheese and sour cream.  Fold in sugar gradually. Add
  vanilla and mix well.  Fold in whipped cream.  Pour into pie shell and
  chill for at least 3 hours.
  
  Pour excess syrup from the can of cherry pie filling.  Leave some, but you
  certainly don't need all of it.  The sauce should cover the cream cheese
  mix, but the cherries shouldn't be drowning in it. Pour pie filling on top.
  Serve cold.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple cherry cream cheese pie -- My wife makes this for me
  periodically, and it is always delicious. No baking is required, and it is
  very easy to make. Yield: Makes one pie.
  
  *  If you don't have the time to sit around for 3 hours waiting for the pie
  to chill, make the cream cheese filling the night before and let the pie
  chill overnight.
  
  *  We prefer to use non-dairy whipped cream substitute.  We usually use the
  same brand name ingredients for best results:  Philadelphia cream cheese,
  Breakstone's sour cream, Cool-whip and Comstock cherry pie filling.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 3 hours chilling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK, especially with the vanilla.

  MOUSSE:

  medium heat.  When the butter is well-incorporated into the cream, add the
  chocolates.Stir off the heat until melted and well-blended. Add the egg
  yolks.
  
  Quickly fold 1/4 of the chocolate mixture into the beaten whites, then fold
  the whites into the chocolate.
  
  Fill the crust with the filling and refrigerate several hours.  If you like
  may add Bailey's Irish Cream to the filling to flavour and whip cream with
  a tiny bit of sugar and some Frangelico liqueur.  Amaretto for the whipping
  cream is also nice.  It's just a decadent final touch to an alread-decadent
  dessert.

      Title: Christmas Stars
 Categories: Cookies, Christmas, Usenet
      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
----------------------------------COOKIES----------------------------------
      1 c  Solid shortening
           -(NOT butter)
    2/3 c  Granulated sugar
      2    Eggs
      1 t  Salt
      1 t  Vanilla
      1 t  Almond flavoring
  2 3/4 c  Flour

----------------------------------FROSTING----------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Powdered sugar
      2 T  Cream or milk
  1 1/2 t  Vanilla (not Mexican,
           -unless you like
           -tan frosting)
           Food coloring
 
  Cream together the shortening and sugar.  Beat in the eggs, salt and
  flavorings.  Stir in the flour until blended.  Chill in the refrigerator
  for an hour or two.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Roll out on a floured surface to a
  thickness of about 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Cut with the cookie cutters of your
  choice (this was always a cause for argument in our family). Bake on
  ungreased cookie sheets until tan around the edges, about 8-10 minutes.
  Allow to cool.
  
  Make the frosting by beating together the sugar, milk and vanilla until
  smooth.  Divide and color each portion.  Frost the cookies.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Frosted cookie-cutter cookies -- My mom got this recipe many years ago
  in a cookbook that came in installments, so it didn't have a name on the
  binder and I don't know what it was called. She had us (the kids) make
  these cookies every year. Yield: 2-4 dozen.
  
  *  These cookies are about the only ones I know that taste better cooked
  and cold than as raw dough.
  
  *  Cinnamon red hots make good eyes for animals or Santas.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 2 hours chilling, 15 minutes rolling and
  baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

 Categories: Cookies, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 5 Dozen
 
      3    Egg whites
      1 c  Sugar
      1 t  Vanilla
      1 c  Coconut, shredded
           Almonds, whole,
           -unblanched (optional)
 
  Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.  In large bowl use an electric mixer to beat
  the egg whites until stiff peaks form.  Gradually beat in sugar. Add
  vanilla. With a rubber spatula gently fold in coconut.
  
  Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto greased, floured cookie sheets. Press an
  almond in center of each cookie.  Bake at 300 degrees F. for 20 to 25
  minutes. Remove to racks to cool.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Holiday cookies -- Coconut and almonds give this cookie a distinctive
  flavor.  For me the almonds are required.
  
  *  It is a lot of work to beat the egg whites enough without an electric
  mixer.
  
  *  This cookie must be handled a little more carefully than most as it
  forms a white shell which causes it to be slightly delicate.
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy.

      1    Lemon rind, grated
      2 T  Corn starch
      3    Eggs, separated
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      3 T  Flour
      1 ts Butter or margarine
      2 c  Boiling water
 
  Sift flour, corn starch, and sugar into a saucepan.  Add butter.  Add the
  lemon juice to the egg yolks and beat with a rotary egg beater until they
  are thick and velvety.  Add this to the sugar, corn starch, butter and
  flour mixture and stir until free from lumps.  You may need to add a few
  tablespoons of cold water to make thin enough not to lump. Pour the boiling
  water over lemon mixture.  Set on the stove and let come to a boil,
  stirring constantly.  And here is a secret; Your pie will have a better
  flavor if it scorches just a tiny bit. Add grated lemon rind.
  
  Let cool, stirring often.  Pour into pie shell, and add meringue.  Do not
  flatten the meringue, but let it stand in peaks.  Brown slightly.

  NOTES:
  
  *  Moist cookies with cranberries, apples and cinnamon -- Many years ago
  one of my brothers complained to me that he didn't like cookies much, that
  they were always too dry and pasty. I came up with this recipe for him. He
  still doesn't like cookies, but the recipe has made its way to various
  other people to become a favorite.
  
  *  Don't store these in a cookie jar, they will get too mushy.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 15 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: Cream Cheese Butter Cookies
 Categories: Cookies, Usenet
      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
    1/2 lb Butter
      1 c  Sugar
  2 1/2 c  Flour, all-purpose
      1    Egg yolk
      4 oz Cream cheese
           Raspberry jam
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream together the butter and sugar. Add
  the flour and egg yolk and mix well. Add the cream cheese and mix well.
  
  Roll into balls about 5/8 inch diameter.  Place them on an ungreased cookie
  sheet (the cookies don't grow when baked, so they can be somewhat close
  together).  Then press your thumb into each to flatten it and make an
  indentation to hold some jam.  Fill it with jam.  Bake at 350 degrees F for
  15 to 20 minutes.
  
  You can use any flavor jam you like.  The jam is the only part of the
  cookie that has any texture, so I prefer using it to jelly.
  
  Don't eat the cookies straight from the oven, or you'll probably burn your
  tongue.  The jam stays hotter much longer than the cookie.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Simple filled butter cookies with cream cheese.  Yield:  3-4 dozen.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, but strenuous if made by hand.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 15-20 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  Measure the ingredients.

      Title: Crustless Apple Pie
 Categories: Pies & past
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      5 c  Apples, peeled, cored, cutup
      1 c  Sugar (or less)
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 c  Biscuit mix *
      2    Eggs
    3/4 c  Milk
      2 tb Butter or margarine softened
      1 ts Vanilla
           TOPPING
    2/3 c  Flour
    1/3 c  Brown sugar, packed
    1/4 ts Salt
      3 tb Butter or margarine
 
  * Use commercial biscuit mix, your own mix or mix together about 1/3 c + 1
  tb flour, 3/8 ts baking powder, 1/8 ts salt, 4 tsp shortening.
  
  Place apples in greased 10 inch pie plate.  Pour sugar over top. Sprinkle
  with cinnamon.
  
  Measure next five ingredients into blender and blend smooth, or measure
  into a bowl and beat until smooth.  Pour over pie.
  
  TOPPING:  Mix topping ingredients until crumbly.  Scatter over apples. Bake
  at 350 F about 50 minutes until apples are cooked and topping is lightly
  browned.
  
  My note:  Why didn't I find a recipe like this *before* I learned to roll
  piecrust?  Amount of sugar could be reduced if apples are sweet enough to
  eat raw.  Daughter's comment, "why didn't you make desserts this good when
  I lived at home?"

           -and peels)
      8 oz Cherries, candied
      1 c  Raisins, dark

  1 1/3 c  Calmyra figs, cut

  1 1/2 c  Pecan halves
           -(or walnut halves
           -if necessary)
    1/2 c  Brandy
      3 c  Flour (white)
      2 t  Baking powder
      2 t  Salt
      1 T  Cinnamon, ground
      1 t  Nutmeg, ground
      1 t  Allspice, ground
      1 t  Cloves, ground
      4    Eggs
  1 3/4 c  Brown sugar, packed
      1 c  Orange juice
    3/4 c  Butter, melted
           -(cooled)
    1/4 c  Molasses, light
           -(treacle)
 
  Mix fruits together in a bowl.  Pour brandy over fruits.  Turn fruit
  mixture over every 20 minutes. Soaking time is a matter of taste, but two
  hours is typical. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Prepare tube pan: grease
  sides and bottom. Line bottom and sides with greased brown paper.
  
  In a very large bowl, mix flour, spices, baking powder and salt.  Stir
  until spices are evenly blended throughout.
  
  In a third bowl beat eggs until fluffy.  Add brown sugar, orange juice,
  molasses and butter.  Mix, making sure that all the sugar dissolves.
  
  Pour off any liquid from fruit mixture and add the fruit and the nuts to
  the dry ingredients. Mix until all fruit pieces are coated. Then pour in
  the liquids and mix gently until you have an evenly-mixed batter.
  
  Pour batter into pan and bake at 300 degrees F. for 1 hour.  Cover pan with
  foil and bake for 1 hour more or until toothpick inserted in center comes
  out clean. Cool for 30 minutes before removing from pan. Peel off paper
  very carefully.
  
  Put cake in cake tin lined with foil.  For the next 3 to 4 weeks, sprinkle
  a little brandy over cake twice a week. Keep cake covered and store the tin
  in the refrigerator. If you prefer to omit the brandy, cover top of cake
  with very thin slices of apple instead.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An extravagant, traditional fruitcake -- This is about as rich a
  fruitcake as you could possibly want to make. It started life as a Better
  Homes and Gardens recipe, but has been changed beyond all recognition.
  Yield:  a 7 lb cake.
  
  *  This makes a HUGE cake.  If your tube pan isn't at least 10 X 4 inches,
  there is a fair chance that it will run over; in that case, use several
  loaf pans instead (fill loaf pans about half-way). A pan with a removable
  center will make extracting the cake much easier.
  
  *  Except for mixing the liquids, an electric beater is useless for this
  recipe.
  
  *  In the USA, candied fruits typically come in packages of the indicated
  sizes.  If you have to measure by volume, use 2 1/2 cups of candied citron
  and 1 1/3 cups of the candied cherries. I prefer citron instead of the
  mixture because there's no bitterness from the rinds, although the cake
  isn't so colorful. Calmyra figs are the light-colored figs most commonly
  seen in North America.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  2 hours preparation (including soaking the fruit), 2 hours baking,
  several weeks mellowing.
  : Precision:  Measure batter ingredients carefully.  Fruit and nut
  quantities are somewhat flexible.

      Title: Deep-Dish Apple Pie with a Cheddar Crust - Hudson Valley
 Categories: Desserts, Pies & past, Fruit, Holiday
      Yield: 2 X 9" pies
 
---------------------------------PIE SHELL---------------------------------
      3 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 lb Sharp Cheddar cheese; grated
    1/2 ts Kosher salt
    1/2 lb (2 sticks) unsalted butter;
           -cut into tablespoons
      2 ea Eggs; lightly beaten

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      5 lb Golden Delicious apples
           -(about 12); peeled, cored,
           -and sliced 1/4-inch thick
      1 ea Juice of 1 lemon
  1 1/2 c  Light browwn sugar
    1/4 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Kosher salt
 
     Make the pie shell: In a food processor  pulse the flour, cheese and
  salt to mix. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles course
  meal. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and make a well in the center.
  Stir in the eggs and work the dough into a ball.
  
     Divide the dough into quarters and flatten into disks.  Roll out each
  disk to an 11-inch round between 2 sheets of waxed paper. Remove the wax
  paper and line two 9-inch pie pans with a dough round. Refrigerate the
  lined pans and the 2 dough rounds, covered, until thoroughly chilled.
  
  Make the filling: preheat the oven to 375 F degrees. In a large bowl, toss
  the apples with the lemon juice. Sprinkle on the brown sugar, flour and
  salt and toss well. Divide the apples between the lined pie pans. Moisten
  the pie-shell rims and cover with the dough rounds. Trim any overhang and
  crimp the edges to seal. Cut 4 steam vents in each pie. (Make Ahead: the
  pies can be chilled until firm, then wrapped and frozen for up to two
  weeks. All before baking.)
  
     Bake the pies on the bottom shelf of the oven for about one hour, or
  until golden and bubbly and the apples are tender when pierced ; cover the
  pies with foil halfway through if necessary. Let cool for about one hour
  before serving.

  NOTES:
  
  *  Ultimate cheesecake -- This recipe is the original creation of a
  co-worker, Don Chaney. I consider myself a cheesecake gourmet, and I rate
  this recipe as 8.5 out of 10 (However, there are no 10s). The recipe is so
  simple, I almost feel guilty serving it.
  
  *  Variations: Crush some walnuts into the crust.  Pour a can of cherry or
  blueberry pie filling over the chilled cake, then chill again. Put about
  2-3 T of your favorite liqueur into the cake filling.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 40 minutes baking, overnight cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: Ecclefechan Tarts
 Categories: Uk, Pies & past
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
           **  British Measurements  **

--------------------------------THE FILLING--------------------------------
      2 oz Butter
      3 oz Brown sugar
      2 ts Wine vinegar
      4 oz Mixed dried fruit
      1 oz Walnuts; chopped
      1    Egg
 
  This variation of the border tart is traditionally made into small
  individual tarts, though it can be made into a larger tart.
  
  Directions:
  
  Make a shortcrust pastry, as for the Border Tart and cut 12 circles to line
  a patty tin, or line an 8-inch flan ring.
  
  Melt the butter and stir in the sugar and egg. Add the vinegar, fruit and
  nuts and spoon into pastry cases.
  
  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes at 375øF / 190øC / gas mark 3. Serve either hot
  or cold.
  
  You may note this recipe is not too dissimilar from Queen Mary's Tart! **

 Categories: Uk, Pies & past
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
           **  British Measurements  **
           Ingredients listed in recipe
 
  The following recipe was introduced to me by the latter name with the story
  that it had been devised as a treat when Mary Queen of Scots first came to
  Edinburgh. It was certainly a tea time treat and because it is so easy to
  make, well worth a try.
  
  Directions:
  
  Line a greased 8 or 9 inch shallow dish, plate or flan ring with puff
  pastry and into the centre pour the following mixture:
  
  2 ounces of sugar dissolved in 2 ounces of melted butter to which is added
  2 ounces of chopped candied peel, 1 ounce of sultanas and 2 beaten eggs.
  
  Bake in a hot oven, 450øF / 230øC / gas mark 8 for about 15 to 20 minutes.
  Use a lower shelf. Or reduce the temperature slightly and bake for 20 to 30
  minutes.
  
  It looks extraordinary but is delicious served either hot or cold with
  cream. ** Scottish Home Baking **

      Title: Ernest Hemingway Key Lime Pie
 Categories: Desserts, Pies & past
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
 
  Some might wonder the connection between Key Lime Pie and Ernest Hemingway,
  but he hung out a lot, a regular squatter of sorts, at Papa John's Bar, Key
  West Florida.  There are not too many recipes attributed to him, and then I
  recently ran across this one for Key Lime Pie. The intro to the recipe
  attributes that Hemingway used to live at 1599 Bathurst Street in Toronto,
  Canada. He was working as a young journalist then for the Toronto Star. He
  eventually moved to Florida, then Cuba, and developed a fond appetite for
  white rum, seafood and Key West Lime Pie. He hung out quite a bit with such
  randy's as Steven Boyd.  Papa John's is quite a museum in itself and sports
  newspaper articles and pictures of Papa and his cronies (including Boyd).
  So here is Papa's Key Lime Pie.  I do believe this recipe was printed at
  one time in the Toronto Star. 1 cup sugar 250 mL 1/4 cup white flour 50 mL
  3 TBS cornstarch 40 mL 2 cups spring water 500 mL 3 egg yolks 3 1 TBS
  margarine                    15 mL 1/4 cup fresh lime juice 50 mL grated
  rind of 1 lime one baked pie shell meringue pie topping
  
  Combine sugar, flour, cornstarch in top of double boiler and gradually stir
  in water.  Cook over medium heat, whisking until thickened.
  
  Beat egg yolks and gradually stir some of cooked mixture into beaten egg
  yolks.  Return this mixture to double boiler and cook and whisk another 3
  minutes.
  
  Stir in margarine, lime juice and rind.  Cook to lukewarm.  Pour into your
  favorite baked shell and cool thoroughly.  Top with meringue and brown
  under broiler, or your favorite whipped cream topping.
  
  For you pie shell, why not add a small amount of sugar and some finely
  crushed macadamia nuts?  Takes it a cut above.
  
  (And I always use more lime juice--its a matter of taste.  I like it tart
  and cut back on the sugar.)

  mixture lightly with a fork to combine. When mixture can be compressed
  easily with a fork, enough ice water has been added. Form pastry mixture
  into a flat disk and wrap tightly in plastic wrap or waxed paper. Pastry
  may be refrigerated until ready for use. Roll between two sheets of waxed
  paper to 1/8-inch thickness. If pre-baking for non-baked filling, bake at

      Title: Flan
 Categories: Desserts, Mexican, Usenet
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Sugar
      2    Eggs
      2    Egg yolks
      2 c  Milk
      1 t  Vanilla extract
 
  In a small kettle, heat about 3 T of sugar with about 1 t of water until
  the mixture turns brown. Pour the mixture into 4 gelatin molds. Move the
  molds around so that the mixture coats the interior. Set aside.
  
  Mix the eggs, sugar, milk and the vanilla extract.  Pour the mixture into
  the molds. Put the molds over a deep pan with water (double boiler or bain
  marie technique) for 1 hr in a 350 degree F. oven. Keep the water in the
  pan at the same level by adding boiling water. Cool and put it in the
  refrigerator. Unmold the flan before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich Mexican custard -- This recipe comes from the "Delicias
  Culinarias" cookbook that I brought from Mexico.
  
  *  You can substitute liquor for some of the milk to make the flan richer.
  Personally, I use about 1 cup of milk and about 1 cup rompope (Mexican
  eggnog).
  
  *  Be careful when coating glass molds as they can break because of the
  sudden change in temperatures. You have to do it fast as the mixture
  hardens very quickly.

      Title: Fruit Tart
 Categories: Fruit, Usenet, Pies & past
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
      1    Pie shell (make your own,
           -or buy the frozen,
           -uncooked kind)
    1/2 c  Water
      1 c  Sugar
  2 1/2 t  Cornstarch
     10 c  Fruit, sliced
           Cinnamon or nutmeg,
           -ground (to taste)
 
  Mash about 2 C of the fruit in a saucepan with the water, sugar, and
  cornstarch.  Add another sprinkle of nutmeg or cinnamon.  Boil until the
  liquid becomes clear (about two minutes).
  
  Place the remaining fruit in the pie shell, and a sprinkle of the nutmeg or
  cinnamon.  Pour the hot mixture over the fruit, and let cool for at least
  two hours.
  
  Serve with whipped cream or ice cream as desired.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A quick fruit tart pie -- This is just about the ideal way to use up any
  fresh fruit you have lying around.  I got the recipe from my mom.
  
  *  Any fresh fruit in season will do; I've made peach, nectarine and
  strawberry/banana, all to good effect.
  
  *  Scheduling usually works out well if you make this shortly before
  serving the meal, and let it cool while you eat.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, two hours cooling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      4 lb Venison
      2 lb Beef suet
           -Tart apples
      3 lb Brown sugar
      2 c  Maple Syrup OR
      2 c  Dark molasses
      2 qt Cider
      3 lb Currants
      4 lb Seeded raisins
    1/2 lb Citron, cut fine
      1    Ot
      1 qt Brandy OR
      1 qt Wine
      1 T  Cinnamon

           -Apple jack OR
 
  Cover and cook the venison and suet with boiling water until tender; let it
  cool in the liquid. When it is cold and the fat has solidified, remove meat
  and chop the cake fat (suet). Reboil the liquid until it has been reduced
  to 1 1/2 cups. Chop the venison and add it to twice as much peeled, cored
  and finely chopped apple. Add the sugar and maple syrup or molasses. Add
  the dried fruit, suet, cider and the reduced boiling liquid. Boil slowly
  for 2 hours, stirring to prevent burning. Add the apple jack or brandy or
  wine and the spices. Mix thoroughly and store in crocks or jars. May also
  be frozen, but does't freeze hard. Yield: 15 pies, recipe can be cut in
  half.
  
  Note: It is by no means necessary to use exactly the ingredients given. You
  may want to add orange or lemon peel, chopped figs or may prefer a
  different proportion of spices. You may also use wine or sherry in place of
  the cider.

      Title: German Friendship Cake
 Categories: Cakes, Sourdough, Usenet
      Yield: 1 Cake
 
      1 c  Cake starter

--------------------------------STARTER FOOD--------------------------------
      1 c  Milk
      1 c  Flour, self-raising
      1 c  Sugar

------------------------------------CAKE------------------------------------
      2 c  Flour, self-raising
      1 c  Sugar
    2/3 c  Oil
      2 t  Cinnamon
      2 t  Vanilla extract
      2    Eggs
    1/2 c  Raisins
    1/2 c  Nuts (or other fruits)
     15 oz Pineapple chunks,
           -drained (one can)
 
  PREPARE STARTER:
  
  Day 1:  Blend the starter feed together, and then hand mix in the starter.
  I find it easiest to mix the flour and sugar together dry, add the milk to
  the starter, and then slowly add the flour and sugar to the liquid. The
  starter should never be beaten with a blender or refrigerated. Pour the
  mixture into a large bowl, cover with cling-film or a damp towel, and leave
  to brew.
  
  Day 2:  Thoroughly mix the sourdough, then leave to brew again.
  
  Day 5:  As day 1
  
  Day 6:  As day 2
  
  Day 10:  Print off three copies of this recipe.  Here now is why this is
  called a friendship cake.  Take 3 cups of Sourdough mixture, and give them
  away with copies of the recipe  as starters to your friends. Then proceed
  with the baking.
  
  MAKING THE CAKE:  Blend all ingredients thoroughly with remaining starter.
  Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F.  Pour mixture into a well-greased baking
  tin. Bake for 1 3/4 hours (less in a fan oven), cool.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A 10-day Sourdough cake -- This is known as the friendship cake, it's a
  bit like a chain letter in that you have to find a set of friends to pass
  on the starter to.
  
  During preparation put the starter into a very large bowl (it foams up),
  and cover with a lid or with cling film. Yield: Starter and one cake.

      Title: Gluten-Free Pastry
 Categories: Diabetic, Pies & past
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Whole bean flour (try puree)
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
      1 tb Cornmeal
      1 ts GF baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      6 tb Vegetable shortening
      1    Egg white
    3/4 c  Cold water
 
  Bean flour is a new product being promoted by the Ontario Coloured Bean
  Growers of Ontario.  If not available to you, try white bean puree. Less
  fat is required with bean flour than whole wheat flour for pastry.
  
  Stir together dry ingredients, then cut in shortening until mixture is
  crumbly using pastry blender or 2 knives. Try adding puree alternately with
  shortening.
  
  Whisk together egg white and a little less water if using bean puree. Stir
  into dry ingredients to make a soft dough. Divide dough in half. Roll dough
  out to 1/8" thickness on a cornstarch dusted surface, between layers of
  waxed paper or layers of plastic wrap. Press into pan, patching if
  necessary.
  
  For pie shell or single crust: Trim edge leaving half-inch overhang to tuck
  under and flute edge. Line inside of pastry shell with piece of foil. Bake
  at 400 F for 15 minutes or until edges are golden brown, remove foil.
  
  For double-crust pie: Trim edge, fill, roll top pastry. Tuck 1/2 inch
  overhang under edge of bottom crust, press firmly together. Flue edges. Cut
  steam vents. Bake as recipe directs for filling.
  
  Makes 1 double-crust, 2 single pie shells or 24 medium tart shells.
  
  Double crust:  184 calories, 1 starch, 1 fat choice 8 grams total fat, 2
  grams saturated, 0 mg cholesterol, 4 grams protein, 18 grams carbohydrate,
  44 mg sodium, 274 mg potassium. High fibre.

      Title: Glynne's Lemon Meringue Pie
 Categories: Pies & past
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           -----shortcrust pastry-----
      8 oz Self raising flour
      4 oz Margarine
           Grated rind of 1 orange
      1    Egg; beaten
      2 oz Caster sugar
           Enough water to form a ball

           Juice and grated rind of
           -two lemons
      4 tb Cornflour; (approximately)
      2    Eggs
      2 oz Caster sugar
           Water
 
  * This is enough for two bases I normally make a pear custard tart
     with the second base)
  
       Rub the margarine into the flour until it's like bread crumbs add the
  orange rind caster sugar and mix well.Add the beaten egg and mix well . Add
  enough water ( give it a chance to soak in ) a tablespoon at a time to make
  a ball.Cover with clingfilm and refrigerate for at least 1/2 hour.
  
       Put the juice and rind of the lemons into a measuring jug and make up
  to just less than half a pint with some water. Put the cornflour into a cup
  and mix with a couple of tablespoons of the lemon mixture until it is smoot
  . Pour the cornflour mixture and the rest of the lemon and water into a
  saucepan. Heat over a medium heat stirring continuously until the mixture i
  thick ( it does turn out very thick but don't worry ) and the cornflour is
  cooked out. Allow to cool stirring occasionally .
  
       Get the pastry from the fridge and roll out and line an 8 in flan case
  pie dish , I'm not sure what you call it , and prick the base with a fork.
  Bake the pastry blind , lined with foil & baking beans, for 15 mins in a
  hot oven ( 180-200 C) so that it doesn't rise too much but is golden.
  
       Remove the base from the oven.
  
       Separate the two eggs , retain the whites , and beat the yolks into th
  lemon mixture until smooth . Beat the sugar into the lemon mixture until
  smooth . Fill the pastry case with the lemon mixture . Add a tablespoon of
  sugar to the egg whites and whisk until it forms peaks fold in the rest of
  the caster sugar and pile on top of the pie. Bake in the oven until the
  meringue is nicely brown . Serve hot or cold.
  
       I have also tried this with oranges ( made up to 1/2 pint with orange
  juice rather than water) and lemon zest in the pastry.

      Title: Great Meringue
 Categories: Pies & past
      Yield: 1 Meringue
 
----------------------------FROM ELAINE PONCELET----------------------------

----------------------------VISION DIMENSION BBS----------------------------
     12 md Egg whites
    1/4 ts Heaping of cream of tartar
      2 c  Powdered sugar
 
  Preheat oven to 400F. Separate yolks from whites, being careful not to drip
  any yellow in the whites or they won't beat up. Put into a bowl, add the
  cream of tartar, and beat until stiff.
  
  Add the powdered sugar and beat until it forms soft peaks.
  
  Spread a layer of meringue on the pie. Make a good seal over the filling.
  Spread until it meets the edge of the crust to keep the meringue from
  shrinking as it stands or bakes. Repeat until the meringue is used up, then
  gently swirl the top to make it pretty.
  
  Bake about 15 minutes or until golden brown.

      Title: Gumdrop Cake
 Categories: Cakes, Usenet
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
      4 c  Flour
      2    Eggs
      1 t  Baking soda
  1 1/2 c  Applesauce
    1/4 t  Salt
      1 t  Vanilla
      1 t  Cinnamon
      1 lb Raisins, white
    1/4 t  Cloves, ground
      8 oz Gumdrops (no black
           -ones; 2 standard bags)
    1/4 t  Nutmeg
     12 oz Coconut, shredded
           -(1 standard bag)
      1 c  Butter
           Walnuts, to taste
      2 c  Sugar
 
  Cream together butter, sugar and eggs in one bowl.  In another bowl, mix
  the dry ingredients together (flour, salt, soda and seasonings). Add the
  flour mixture to the butter mixture half at a time, alternating it with the
  applesauce.  Pick all the black gumdrops out and eat them or throw them
  away. Add the nuts, raisins, coconut and remaining gumdrops; blend well.
  
  Line 2 large loaf pans or 5 small loaf pans with wax paper! (Grease won't
  work).  Fill pans about 2/3 full.  Bake at 300 degrees F. for about 2
  hours. Let cool for about 15 minutes before you try to remove the loaves
  from the pan. They should just fall right out when turned upside down, then
  peel off the wax paper.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cake with gumdrops, applesauce, raisins and coconut.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, though creaming butter and sugar without a food
  processor is tedious.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 2 hours baking, 15 minutes cooling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
  
  The smaller gumdrops work best when you go to cut the cake.  I can never
  find small gumdrops that are not 'spice drops', so I buy the large ones and
  cut them into quarters. The cake also slices a lot better when almost
  entirely cool. If you try to cut a piece while it's still hot, it'll taste
  GREAT, but it will crumble all over.

      Title: Halvas Politikos
 Categories: Desserts, Greek, Usenet
      Yield: 1 Dessert
 
      1 c  Olive oil
      2 c  Semolina
      3 c  Sugar
      4 c  Water
           Cinnamon, powdered
 
  Dissolve the sugar in the water and bring it to a boil.  At the same time,
  brown the semolina in the oil on high heat, stirring continuously.
  
  When the semolina has taken a golden brown colour, add the syrup into it
  (taking care not to burn your hands), turn down the heat and keep stirring
  until you get a kind of thick porridge.  Pour into any kind of mold you can
  think of (a cake-mold is perfect for the job), and let it cool.
  
  Unmold into a platter and sprinkle with cinnamon.  Slice it using a wet
  knife, serve, and watch your weight go sky high!
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A Greek dessert with semolina -- This is a traditional greek dessert
  that is extremely about tasty, and as easy to make as 1-2-3-4. Tasty.
  Yield: fills a cake-mold.
  
  *  You should be very careful pouring the syrup into the browned semolina,
  as it is extremely hot, and pouring water on it causes an eruption of
  scaldingly hot steam.
  
  *  You should not put this dessert in the refrigerator.  It can keep for a
  few days outside the refrigerator, assuming you can gather enough will
  power not to eat it all at once. Some oil will start to drain off after a
  day or so, but this is to be expected. Just make sure you don't leave the
  dessert on your favourite tablecloth!
  
  *  The recipe doubles, halves etc.  nicely as long as you keep the
  proportion of the ingredients.
  
  *  I have seen variations on this dessert using any kind of fat imaginable,
  ranging from cooking fat to olive oil or butter, though I've only tried it
  with olive oil.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15-20 minutes.
  : Precision:  Measure the ingredients, except for the sugar which you can
  adjust to taste.

      Title: Hazelnut Cherry Tart
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
-----------------------------------PASTRY-----------------------------------
    1/2 c  Plain flour
    1/8 t  Salt
      2 oz Hazelnuts, roasted
           -ground
      2 T  Sugar
      2 oz Butter
      1    Egg yolk
      2 t  Water

------------------------------CUSTARD FILLING------------------------------
      4    Egg yolks
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 t  Vanilla extract
  1 3/4 c  Cream
      3 t  Gelatine
      2 T  Water

----------------------------------TOPPING----------------------------------
      2 lb Cherries, canned
      2 t  Gelatine
      2 t  Rum (see note)
 
  MAKE PASTRY:  Sift flour and add all dry ingredients together, with the
  sugar in the centre, on a pastry board. Add the butter (softened), egg yolk
  and water. Work the liquids into the sugar, until it is creamy.
  
  Now work in the flour mixture, as you would for any sweet pastry. Press the
  dough into a greased 9-inch flan tin. Prick the base of the pastry all
  over. Refrigerate for 30 mins, then cook in a moderate oven (375 degrees
  F.) for 15 to 20 mins (until golden brown)
  
  MAKE FILLING:  Put egg yolks, sugar and vanilla into a bowl and beat until
  thick and creamy.  Heat cream carefully until almost boiling.
  
  Combine the two mixtures, beating until smooth, then add the result to the
  top of a double boiler and simmer until it thickens (STIR CONSTANTLY).
  
  Dissolve the gelatine in the water and add to the cream mixture, stirring
  well until it is well mixed. Allow this mixture to cool completely before
  adding to the pastry case. Refrigerate until it sets.
  
  MAKE TOPPING:  Drain the cherries and reserve about 1 cup of the syrup. We
  don't use commercial canned cherries.  I would suggest a "light" syrup.
  Arrange the pitted cherries artistically over the top of the tart.
  
  Put the reserved syrup, gelatine and rum (we usually use cherry brandy or
  kirsch) into a saucepan and heat (stirring) until gelatine dissolves. Cool
  the liquid and pour over the cherries.  Refrigerate until set.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A thoroughly decadent desert -- This has simply got to be the best
  dessert you'll ever try. My wife has made this one many times. The only
  complaint ever lodged is that there was not enough.
  
  *  Don't be put off by the complexity of the recipe; it is well worth the
  effort.
  
  *  All the egg whites "wasted" can be used in something else, such as a
  Pavlova.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate to hard.
  : Time:  several hours preparation, cooking and cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients carefully.

      Title: Helen's Carrot Cake
 Categories: Cakes, Usenet
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      4    Eggs, separated
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      1 c  Carrots, grated
      1 c  Walnuts, finely grated
  1 1/2 c  Flour
      1 t  Baking powder
    1/4 t  Nutmeg
    1/2 t  Cinnamon
      1 t  Vanilla extract
      1 pn Salt
      1 c  Oil
  2 1/2 t  Water, hot
    1/2 t  Baking soda

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      8 oz Cream cheese
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Jam (strawberry,
           -apricot or raspberry)

----------------------------------FROSTING----------------------------------
      1 c  Whipping cream
      2 T  Sugar
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Cream together egg yolks and about 1 cup of
  the sugar until the yolk color lightens.  Stir in carrots, nuts, flour,
  baking powder, nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, salt and oil. Mix together hot
  water and soda and stir into flour mixture.
  
  Beat egg whites until foamy.  Gradually add remaining sugar.  Beat until
  stiff and glossy. Fold egg white mixture into flour mixture.
  
  Turn mixture into a greased pan, 13 x 9-inch, lined with greased wax paper
  and bake for 45 minutes or until done. Cool. Slice in half horizontally, to
  form two layers.
  
  Make the cream cheese filling:  soften the cream cheese and beat in the
  sugar, mixing gradually, until the filling is smooth and fluffy. A food
  processor works well for this.
  
  Cover bottom layer with cream cheese filling, then cover cream cheese layer
  with jam.  Place the top layer of the cake carefully on top of the jam.
  
  Make the frosting:  beat the whipping cream until slightly stiff, then add
  the sugar and beat the mixture to stiff peaks. Frost the entire cake with
  whipped cream.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Carrot cake with cream cheese filling -- I got this recipe originally
  from _The Oregonian_ in Portland, Oregon.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking and cooling, 10 minutes
  frosting.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: Helen's Pumpkin Pudding
 Categories: Pies & past
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Browned, strained pumpkin
      2 tb All purpose flour
      1 c  Brown sugar
      2 c  Milk
      1 c  Carnation 2% canned milk
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Ginger
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
      2    Eggs, beaten
 
  This recipe calls for browned pumpkin which is accomplished by buttering a
  heavy cast iron frying pan and cooking the 2 cups pumpkin over medium heat,
  stirring and turning so all parts dry properly. Keep this up til it is
  reduced to 1 1/2 cups.  It will be slightly browned.
  
  Place the browned pumpkin in a bowl, sprinkle with flour and brown sugar
  and stir til thoroughly mixed.  Add spices and eggs and beat well. Scald
  milk.  Add the canned milk to scalded milk.  Add milks to pumpkin mixture
  Beat together til well mixed.
  
  Place mixture in a greased casserole and place it in a larger casserole
  with hot water that comes half way up the outside of inner casserole. Place
  in a 325 F oven and oven poach til a knife comes out clean when tested.
  Serve hot or cold.
  
  This is actually my pumpkin pie filling, but I prefer it without the pastry
  and it is better for me.  No great amount of fat in this one.

      Title: Hobee's Coffee Cake

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
------------------------------------CAKE------------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Flour (unbleached),
           -sifted
      1 c  Sugar,  granulated
      2 t  Baking powder
    1/2 t  Baking soda
    1/4 t  Salt
      2    Eggs
      1 c  Sour cream
    1/2 t  Vanilla
    1/4 c  Blueberries, fresh,
           -optional (or other
           -fruit, or nuts such
           -as walnuts)
           Vegetable oil

----------------------------------TOPPING----------------------------------
      5 T  Sugar,  granulated
      2 T  Butter
    1/2 t  Cinnamon, ground
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a large mixing bowl, resift sift flour
  with baking power, baking soda, salt and about 1 cup of sugar.
  
  In a separate bowl, beat together the eggs, sour cream and vanilla. Add egg
  mixture to flour mixture and beat until smooth.
  
  Oil a 9-inch square baking pan (you can also use an 8 inch square pan, or
  anything of similar surface area, if you increase the baking time by about
        5    minutes).
  
  Spread the batter in the pan.  If you are using fruit or nuts, scatter them
  over the batter and stir a little bit so that they stay in the top layer.
  
  In a small bowl, mix about 5 T sugar with the butter and cinnamon with a
  sturdy fork, until they are blended and resemble cornmeal (i.e., you should
  have a mixture of fine crumbs, not a smooth mixture). Sprinkle topping over
  batter. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until a clean toothpick inserted in the
  center of the cake comes out dry. Cool slightly; serve warm or at room
  temperature.  Don't ruin it by serving it with salted butter.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Coffee cake from "Hobee's Haven" restaurant here in Silicon Valley
  (usually just called "Hobee's") serves a lot of brunch food, and as far as
  I can tell they always include a piece of their coffee cake with each
  order. Frankly, I don't care for breakfast, nor do I approve of places at
  which the only kind of tea you can order reeks of orange and cinnamon...
  but the coffee cake is pretty good. This is their recipe, printed in an
  advertising flyer for the shopping center they inhabit; it's quite easy.
  
  *  All ingredients and bowls should be a room temperature before you start;
  this is particularly true for the butter.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10-15 minutes preparation, 20-30 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Yield: 4 Dozen
 
      1 c  Flour
      2 t  Baking powder
    1/2 t  Salt
      1 t  Cinnamon, ground
    1/4 t  Nutmeg, ground
    1/2 c  Butter (softened
           -to room temperature)
      1 c  Brown sugar (packed
           -firmly into measuring cup)
  1 1/2 c  Oats, quick-cooking
           -(uncooked)
      2 lg Eggs (lightly beaten)

  NOTES:
  
  *  Delicious high-fiber oatmeal drop cookies -- These oatmeal cookies are
  for cookie lovers to splurge with. Not only are they great tasting, but
  they are very high in fiber content and easy to make. The recipe is mine
  and is based on several different ideas in different cookbooks as how to
  best to make them. In fun, I call them "Invisible Oatmeal Cookies" because
  they are wont to disappear whenever unguarded. Enjoy.
  
  *  If any children (young or old) live within smelling distance of your
  stove, make extra cookies for when they suddenly show up for an unexpected
  visit.
  
  *  The recipe may be halved, doubled, or whatever without harm.  The batter
  as well as the baked cookies freeze well. Thaw batter on countertop. Thaw
  cookies either in microwave or in oven.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes.

      Title: Key Lime Pie
 Categories: Southern, Usenet, Pies & past
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
      3    Eggs
     14 oz Condensed milk (one
           -standard can)
      4 oz Key Lime juice
           Sugar
      1    Graham cracker pie
           -crust
 
  Separate the eggs.  You'll be whipping the whites, so put them in a large
  enough bowl.  Combine the egg yolks, the condensed milk and the juice, and
  stir until thoroughly combined.  The acidity of the juice thickens the milk
  and eggs into a custard.
  
  Add a pinch of sugar to the egg whites, and beat them until stiff but not
  dry.
  
  Spoon the custard into the pie crust and even it out.  Spoon the beaten egg
  whites on top of the custard and even it out so it looks pretty.
  
  Chill before serving.  If you like, run the pie under a hot broiler for a
  minute until the egg whites are slightly browned.  (This is primarily for
  appearance, it doesn't affect the flavor much.)
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Traditional lime pie dessert from the Florida Keys -- This very easy
  custard pie originated in the Florida Keys in the 1800's when fresh
  ingredients other than the local limes were hard to come by. See the notes
  for information on some of the ingredients.  Yield: One 8-inch pie.
  
  *  Everybody in the Florida Keys seems to have a variant of this recipe. It
  shows up on postcards, place mats, lime juice bottles and guide books. Some
  people fold a little of the beaten egg white into the custard to make it
  lighter.  Some put sweetened whipped cream on top rather than egg white.
  Some use two or four eggs.
  
  *  Traditionally, this pie is made from the juice of the Key lime, a small
  yellow citrus fruit quite different from the larger and more familiar
  Persian lime. Key limes are very sensitive to cold and in the U.S. have
  never been grown above the very southern tip of Florida. Bad weather and
  disease have killed off so many of them that the only remaining grove is a
  private one on one of the Keys, so you cannot buy Key lime juice in the
  U.S.  any more. Key limes are still grown widely in South America and
  probably elsewhere on other continents.
  
  There is something called Key West lime juice sold in pint bottles which
  everybody uses instead now, which seems to be regular lime juice slightly
  concentrated.  It's widely available in Florida and occasionally elsewhere
  in the U.S. It's also available via mail order from Key West Aloe,
  telephone +1 305 294 5592 or 800-327-5866. In a pinch, you can substitute
  regular lime juice, though it doesn't produce quite the bright yellow
  custard that traditionalists like. You may have to use extra juice, because
  Persian limes are less acidic than Key limes.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1-2 hours chilling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: Key Lime Pie "Original"
 Categories: Pies & past, Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 ea Unflavored gelatin
    1/4 c  Water
    2/3 c  Sugar; divided
    1/2 c  Key lime juice
    1/4 t  Salt
      2 t  Grated lime rind
      4 ea Eggs; separated
 
  9"      ea baked pastry shell I got this recipe from a "Cracker," and it
  will dispute the previous statement that all will agree on how to make the
  best Key Lime Pie. My tree froze, but came back, so we've enjoyed this
  recipe a lot this year. Mix togethe gelatin, 1/3 c sugar and salt in
  saucepan. Combine slightly beaten egg yolks, water & lime juice. Add to
  gelatin mixture. Place over low heat, stirring constantly, until gelatin
  dissolves, about 6 min. Remove from heat and add rind. Cool. Beat egg
  whites until stiff but not dry. Gradually add remaining 1/3 c sugar and
  beat until stiff. Fold in gelatin mixture. Turn into pastry shell and chill
  until firm. Garnish with whipped cream and lime slices if desired. Note: To
  make lime chiffon cream pie, fold in 1/2 c heavy cream, whipped before
  turning into pastry shell. This is a much lighter pie than the one using
  sweetened consensed milk, and I think it has a more of the flavor of Key
  limes.

      Title: Kolachki
 Categories: Cookies, Russian, Holiday, Usenet
      Yield: 6 Dozen
 
--------------------------------COOKIE DOUGH--------------------------------
    1/2 lb Cream cheese
           -(at room temperature)
    1/2 lb Butter (at room
           -temperature)
      3 c  Flour
      1 x  Walnut filling, below
           -OR
     12 oz Poppy seed filling
           -(1 can)

-------------------------------WALNUT FILLING-------------------------------
      1 lb Walnuts, finely ground
      1    Egg
      1 c  Sugar
           Water
 
  Mix butter and cream cheese until smooth.  Add flour and mix again until
  smooth.  Making this dough is easy with a food processor, hard with a
  mixer.
  
  Roll dough into 3 balls.  Refrigerate dough to keep it from drying out. The
  dough can be refrigerated for 1-2 hours, but it is not necessary. Roll out
  1 ball at a time and flour lightly. Roll dough out in flour or granulated
  sugar so it doesn't stick.
  
  Cut dough into squares or circles using cookie or biscuit cutter.  Add
  about a teaspoon of filling. Roll squares into "logs." Fold circles over
  and seal with a fork. Bake at 375 degrees F. for 10-15 minutes or until
  lightly browned.
  
  MAKE FILLING:  Mix all ingredients together.  Add water to obtain a sticky
  consistency.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Russian Cookies -- This recipe is from Mrs. Malinch, my little sister's
  high school Russian teacher.  I usually make this recipe at Christmas or
  Easter.
  
  My favorite fillings are poppy seed and walnut.  A recipe for the walnut
  filling is included.  The poppy seed filling can be found canned (Solo
  brand) in either the gourmet or cake section of most grocery stores. Yield:
        6    dozen Kolachki.
  
  *  The kolachki are delicate, so do not throw them in a plastic bag or pile
  high in a jar as you would cookies.  The kolachki can be frozen.

      Title: Kourabiedes
 Categories: Cookies, Greek, Christmas, Usenet
      Yield: 30 Pieces
 
      2 c  Butter, unsalted
      1 c  Sugar, powdered
      3    Egg yolks
      3 T  Brandy
      2 t  Vanilla extract
      6 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Almonds (blanched),
           -chopped
      1 lb Sugar, powdered
           -(one package)
 
  Beat the butter with the sugar until it becomes fluffy.  Add the egg yolks
  one by one, beating continuously. Add the brandy and vanilla.
  
  Blend in the almonds and the flour, a cup at a time.  Use enough flour to
  get a firm dough (it may take a bit more or less than the amount mentioned
  in the ingredients list). Use your hands to do the mixing, as an electric
  mixer will be useless after the first two or three cups of flour have been
  added. Place the dough in the refrigerator for at least one hour.
  
  Shape the dough into balls, about one inch in diameter, flatten them and
  place on greased cookie sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 20 minutes.
  
  Remove from the oven.  Roll each cookie (while it is still hot) in the
  powdered sugar and put it back on the cookie sheet.  Repeat this step once
  more, so that you get a thicker coating.
  
  Place the coated cookies on a platter, liberally sprinkling each layer and
  the bottom of the platter with powdered sugar. When you are done, there
  shouldn't be any sugar left. Let them cool and they are ready to eat!
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Traditional Greek Christmas cookies coated with powdered sugar -- This
  is one of the two kinds of confection that are traditionally consumed in
  large quantities in Greece during the holiday season (the other is
  melomacarona). As a quick lesson in greek, "kourabiedes" (pronounced
  "kou-ra-bi-ETH-es", is the plural of the word "kourabies" (kou-ra-bi-ES).
  Now all you need to enjoy them is the recipe. I got this one from a Greek
  cookbook and translated it into English.
  
  *  The cookbook suggests the following variations:  using ouzo or scotch
  instead of brandy, and almond extract instead of vanilla extract, but I
  have not tried any of them. Also, putting granulated instead of powdered
  sugar in the dough didn't seem to affect the recipe, there's so much sugar
  in it, that you couldn't tell the difference anyway.
  
  *  The cookbook also suggested using twice the amount of sugar for coating.
  This is obviously too much, but it should make you realize that you must
  really be liberal with the sugar!
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, one hour refrigeration, 20 minutes baking.

      1 ts Grated orange rind

  Line a pie plate with fine crumbs of vanilla wafers or graham crackers. Dot
  all over with tart berry jam.  Over the jam pour the filling made by mixing
  the milk, lemon juice, 2 egg yolks, and lemon rind together in a seperate
  bowl.  This mixture becomes a smooth custard as it is stirred together; it
  requires no cooking.  Cover with a meringue made by beating the 2 egg
  whites stiff and beating in the sugar gradually. Bake in a slow oven (325ø)
  for 15 to 20 minutes, or until meringue is delicately browned. Serve cold.

      Title: Melomacarona
 Categories: Cookies, Greek, Christmas, Usenet
      Yield: 40 Pieces
 
  1 1/2 c  Olive oil
    1/2 c  Butter, unsalted
           -(at room temperature)
      1 c  Beer
    3/4 t  Cinnamon, ground
    1/4 t  Ground cloves, ground
           Orange peel (use the
           -grated peel of one orange)
      1 c  Sugar
      2 c  Semolina, finely ground
      6 c  Flour
    1/2 t  Baking soda
    1/2 t  Baking powder
      1 t  Salt
  1 1/2 c  Sugar (for the syrup)
  1 1/2 c  Honey
      1 c  Water
    1/2 c  Walnuts, chopped
 
  Put the olive oil, butter, beer, cinnamon, cloves, orange peel and sugar in
  a mixing bowl and beat until they are thoroughly blended.
  
  Sift about one cup of flour with the baking soda, baking powder and salt
  and blend into the mixture. Add the semolina, a cup at a time, into the
  mixture.
  
  Add the enough of the remaining flour, a cup at a time, until you get a
  rather firm dough (you may need a bit more or less than the amount
  mentioned in the ingredients list). Use your hands to do the mixing, as an
  electric mixer will be useless after the first two or three C of flour have
  been added.
  
  Roll the dough into cylinders, about two inches long and  one inch in
  diameter, flatten them with your hands, and place them on cookie sheets
  greased with a little olive oil.  Bake at 350 degrees F. for half an hour.
  Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool for about half an hour.
  
  Make the syrup:  mix the sugar, honey and water, and bring them to a boil.
  Cook on low heat for three minutes and skim off the foam that forms on top.
  Pour the hot syrup over the cookies, sprinkle them with the chopped walnuts
  and let them soak overnight.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Traditional greek Christmas cookies soaked in honey syrup -- This is one
  of the two kinds of confection that are traditionally consumed in large
  quantities in Greece during the holiday season (the other is kourabiedes).
  I suppose the name translates to something like "honey macaroons", except
  that they are not really macaroons. I got the recipe from a greek cookbook.
  
  *  You can use flour instead of semolina, but only as a last resort, as you
  won't be able to get that wonderful grainy texture which you get if you use
  semolina.
  
  *  The amounts given here are for only half a recipe.  Considering that it
  is very hard to eat only one melomacarono, making the full recipe may not
  be as outrageous as it sounds!
  
  : Difficulty:  Easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 30 minutes baking, 30 minutes cooling,
  overnight soaking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

           Angelica (Cut two pieces
           -of crystalized (candied)
           -angelica, each about
           -1/8 inch by 2 inches)
      2    Almonds (blanched)
      2    Pear halves, preferably
           -canned (for
           -authenticity), but
           -cooked, fresh pear
           -would do
 
  Carefully halve the almonds along the natural split in the nut. (This is
  easiest after they are still wet from blanching.)  Place the pear halves,
  round side up, in the serving dish.
  
  At the narrow end of each half, add two almond halves to make mouse ears.
  At the other end, insert the angelica to make a tail.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A quick pear dessert -- In general, a typical Australian dish is a
  typical British dish, which is to say a typical European or American dish
  with most of the subtleties of flavour (and difficulty in making) removed.
  The following dessert is a genuine Old Family Favorite in Australia.
  
  *  Candied angelica is almost impossible to find in North America. Anything
  else with the appropriate properties of sweetness and shape may be
  substituted, e.g.  a piece of chocolate or candy cut to size, such as an
  Ovation mint divided longitudinally.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  2 minutes.
  : Precision:  don't measure, count.

      Title: Mom Stern's Noodle Kugel
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      6    Eggs
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      1 T  Baking powder
      1 T  Vanilla
      4 oz Raisins (1 small box)
      4    Apples
      1 lb Muller's Wide Egg
           -Noodles (one box)
      4 oz Butter (1 stick)
           Cinnamon (for top)
 
  Peel the apples and and slice them into small wedges.
  
  Beat the eggs until they are foamy, add the sugar gradually and beat well.
  
  Cook the noodles according to package directions.  Drain.
  
  Melt the butter in a 9x13 metal baking pan.  Swirl it around to coat the
  pan, and then pour the excess butter into the egg mixture. Add baking
  powder and vanilla to egg mixture, mix well, and then slowly add drained
  noodles, apples and raisins. Mix thoroughly until all the noodles have been
  coated and look gooey.
  
  Pour the egg/noodle mixture into the metal pan, top with cinnamon if you
  desire, and bake at 425 degrees F. for about 45 minutes to an hour, or
  until the top looks a little brown and crispy. The kugel should feel
  springy to the touch and not be "wet." Let cool, cut into squares and
  serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Egg noodles, raisins, cinnamon and apples.  Yield:  Serves 12.
  
  *  This feeds about 12 very hungry people (knoshers, as we call them) or 16
  normal ones.  What you don't eat right away you can wrap in aluminum foil
  and freeze for a month or two. If it's too sweet for your taste, you can
  use peaches or other fruit instead of the raisins.
  
  *  Warning:  this stuff sits very heavy in the ol' stomach, so don't try to
  eat more than 2 pieces in a 24-hour period.
  
  *  Don't thank me, thank my mom.

      Title: Oatmeal Fudge Cookies
 Categories: Cookies, No-bake, Usenet
      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
      3 c  Rolled oats
      1 t  Vanilla extract
      1 c  Nuts, chopped (optional)
      2 c  Sugar, granulated
    1/2 c  Cocoa powder
    1/2 c  Evaporated milk
    1/4 lb Butter
 
  Combine oats, vanilla and nuts in a bowl and set aside.
  
  Combine sugar, cocoa and evaporated milk in a heavy, 2-quart sauce pan.
  Bring to a full rolling boil over medium-high heat, STIRRING CONSTANTLY.
  Let boil, while stirring, for 2 minutes.
  
  Remove pan from heat and add the butter.  Stir until butter is melted and
  incorporated.  Quickly add oat mixture to pan and stir until well mixed.
  
  Drop by the spoonful onto waxed paper.  Let cool for 2 hours to set.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  No-bake chocolate oatmeal cookies -- This may be my all-time favorite
  cookie recipe.  I don't remember where I got this particular version of the
  recipe but I remember my great-aunt making these cookies for us as kids.
  
  *  My great-aunt never put nuts in these cookies.  I like nuts but I find
  that they get lost in the recipe. If you want the oats to be less
  prominent, use quick-cooking oats. They will fall apart somewhat in the
  final mixing.
  
  *  A heavy sauce pan makes burning the fudge less likely but stir, stir,
  stir, anyway.
  
  *  The cooking time at boil is important.  Cooked too little the cookies
  will not set; too much and they start to harden before you get them out of
  the pan.
  
  *  These cookies are better the next day, if there are any left.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation and cooking, 2 hours cooling.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients, watch the cooking time.

    1/4 c  Rum or brandy

-----------------------------------GLAZE-----------------------------------
      4 T  Butter
    1/2 c  Rum or brandy
    1/2 c  Sugar
 
  Mix the melted butter, eggs, rum and coffee together.  Add brown sugar and
  mix well. Add rest of dry ingredients and place in a buttered loaf pan.
  
  Bake at 300 degrees F. for 2 hours or until done (it will separate from the
  sides of the pan).  Make glaze when almost completely baked: Melt (do not
  boil) butter.  Add rum and sugar.  Stir by hand.  Remove the cake from the
  oven and pour half of the glaze over it.  Let it cool 25 minutes, then turn
  it over and pour the remaining glaze on the other side.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A traditional European-style fruit cake -- Although fruitcakes have a
  bad reputation, this one is *excellent*. My mother has been making it for
  years. She originally got the recipe from a friend, but has since adapted
  it to suit her fans. (She gets requests for it all year long.)
  
  *  Don't use glass pans.  This freezes well, if you make more than you can
  eat; just be sure to wrap it carefully so it doesn't get freezer burn. Warm
  frozen cake in the oven, not the microwave.

  NOTES:
  
  This week I thought I'd try a dessert recipe since Brandon's birthday is
  Wednesday and his request was peach pie. This peach pie is one easy dessert
  too. You can make your own pie crust, or buy a frozen one at the store to
  save time (although I recommend making one). I bought some canned peaches
  in light syrup and plan to add about 2 tablespoons sugar or less. Judge for
  yourself as to how sweet you want it to be. I also will add a little
  cinnamon to the crumb mixture. Yum! Peach pie is one of my favorites. Wish
  me luck and Brandon a "Happy Birthday"!

  *  A luscious orange-flavored pound cake -- Absolutely the best cake I have
  ever eaten! I got the recipe from the mother of a friend.  I think Don's
  mom got the recipe off the back of a sugar box.
  
  *  If you try to make a pound cake with margarine or shortening you will
  end up with a tasteless mess. Butter is the major taste in a pound cake;
  even if it weren't, butter and margarine have different properties in
  baking, and this recipe is adjusted for butter.
  
  *  Don't make this cake if you don't have an electric mixer or very strong
  wrists.  I figure I spend nearly half an hour beating butter and such when
  I make this cake. Also, this cake is easier to handle if you have a tube
  pan that comes apart into two pieces.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30-40 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients.

      Title: Original Key Lime Pie
 Categories: Pies & past, Desserts, Fruit
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 ea Unflavored gelatin
    1/4 c  Water
    2/3 c  Sugar; divided
    1/2 c  Key lime juice
    1/4 t  Salt
      2 t  Grated lime rind
      4 ea Eggs; separated
      1 x  9" baked pastry shell
 
  I got this recipe from a "Cracker," and it will dispute the previous
  statement that all will agree on how to make the best Key Lime Pie. My tree
  froze, but came back, so we've enjoyed this recipe a lot this year. Mix
  together gelatin, 1/3 c sugar and salt in saucepan. Combine slightly beaten
  egg yolks, water & lime juice. Add to gelatin mixture. Place over low heat,
  stirring constantly, until gelatin dissolves, about 6 min. Remove from heat
  and add rind. Cool. Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry. Gradually add
  remaining 1/3 c sugar and beat until stiff. Fold in gelatin mixture. Turn
  into pastry shell and chill until firm. Garnish with whipped cream and lime
  slices if desired. Note: To make lime chiffon cream pie, fold in 1/2 c
  heavy cream, whipped before turning into pastry shell. This is a much
  lighter pie than the one using sweetened condensed milk, and I think it has
  a more of the flavor of Key limes.

      Title: Our Lemon Pie
 Categories: Diabetic, Pies & past
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3 tb Margarine;
     10    Graham cracker squares;
    1/2 c  Skimmed evaporated milk;
           -cold
      1 pk Dream Whip;
     27 pk Equal sweetener;
      2    Egg yolks;
      2 lg Lemons; 1/2 cup juice
      3    Egg whites;
      3 tb Sugar;
 
  Melt margarine on medium to low heat.  Roll graham crackers into crumbs
  with rolling pin.  Mix crumbs and melted margarine. Pat to make crust on
  bottom and sides of pie pan. Chill.
  
  Add cold evaporated milk to Dream Whip (do not add vanilla). Sprinkle in 24
  pkg. Equal.  Mix and beat according to directions. Beat egg yolks slightly,
  and gradually stir in lemon juice. Gradually fold in the whipped Dream
  Whip.  Spread in pie crust.  Turn on broiler so it will get hot. Beat 3 egg
  whites frothy (use clean beaters so whites will beat up as fluffy as
  possible).  Add 1 tbs. sugar and beat until blended in. Add another tbs.
  sugar and 3 Equal pkg. and beat until soft peaks form. Spread meringue over
  top. Spread meringue to stick to the edges so it won't shrink when you
  broil it.
  
  Put under broiler for 30-60 seconds until meringue is lightly browned. IT
  DOESN'T TAKE LONG AT ALL AND IS EASY TO BURN. The flavors will blend better
  if you chill for 5 hours.

 Categories: Pies & past
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
           Method only
 
  Prepare and set aside one unbaked pie shell.
  
  Pare and core about 8 cooking apples.  Cut into quarters and cut these in
  half (not 1/8).  Place in a large bowl and set aside.
  
  Combine and mix well: 1/2 C. sugar, 2 T. flour, 1/2 t. cinnamon (the
  original recipe calls for nutmeg, but my family prefers cinnamon). Sprinkle
  over apple chunks and toss slightly.  Spoon into prepared shell. Sprinkle
  over top: 2 T. lemon juice.
  
  Combine in bowl: 1/2 C. sugar, 1/2 C. flour.  Mix well and add 1/2 C butter
  or margarine.  Cut in butter with a pastry blender or two knives until
  mixture is coarse, like cornmeal.  Sprinkle this mixture evenly over top of
  pie.
  
  Slide pie into a large, heavy supermarket paper bag.  Fold open end twice
  and fasten with paper clips.  Place on a baking sheet.  Bake at 425 for 1
  hour.  Remove from oven, split bag open and cool pie on wire rack. DO NOT
  open bag while baking! This is a great pie and one that friends always
  request from me. Enjoy!

      Title: Pavlova I
 Categories: Desserts, Australian, Usenet
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4    Egg whites
           -(at room temperature)
      1 c  Sugar, castor
      1 T  Vinegar
           Cornflour
 
  With an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form, then
  gradually add the sugar (about 1 t every 30 seconds).  This will take
  around 15 minutes. Beat until firm. Add the vinegar. When combined, turn
  out onto a flat baking sheet that has been greased and dusted with
  cornflour. Shape it so that there will be a hollow in the centre to hold
  the fruit.
  
  Cook in a pre-heated, warm oven (350-375 degrees F.) for 10 minutes, then
  at 200-250 degrees F. for 40-50 mins.
  
  When cooked, turn the oven off and allow to cool slowly in the oven for at
  least an hour, preferably overnight.  Gradual cooling is important. Serve
  cold, topped with whipped cream and fresh fruit such as strawberries,
  bananas and kiwi fruit.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pavlova (Australian meringue dessert) -- This is a quintessentially
  Australian dish.  The legend behind it is that it was created by a chef in
  Adelaide after he had seen Anna Pavlova dance, saying that he wanted to
  create a dessert that was as light and airy as her dancing.
  
  Australians pride themselves on their ability to cook a good Pavlova. When
  important visitors come to an Australian household, they are likely to be
  served a Pavlova with plenty of fresh fruit.  There are many variations on
  the recipe. This one comes from my friend Janet Wiles. Yield: Serves 6-8.
  
  *  Castor sugar is known in North America as "granulated sugar." Cornflour
  is likewise "cornstarch." The higher temperature initially is to form a
  crust on the outside of the meringue base, it should be crisp on the
  outside, though not browned, and soft inside. It's important that the
  beaters and the bowl are really dry and clean. Uneven temperatures will
  cause the base to collapse (keep the oven door closed and let it cool
  slowly).  Experienced Pavlova cooks claim that electric ovens work best
  because they heat more uniformly.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, 1 or more hours cooling.
  : Precision:  Measure the ingredients.

      Title: Pavlova Ii
 Categories: Desserts, Australian, Usenet
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 lg Egg whites
      1 c  Sugar, castor
      1 t  Cornflour
      1 t  Vinegar
      1 t  Vanilla flavour
 
  Preheat oven to 250 degrees F.  With an electric mixer beat the egg whites
  until soft peaks form,  then gradually add the sugar.  Beat until firm.
  
  Add the cornflour, vinegar and vanilla.  When combined, turn out onto a
  flat tray that has been greased and dusted with cornflour. Try a circular
  shape with slightly more mixture at the edges so that it may be served by
  placing goodies in its centre depression.
  
  Cook in a pre-heated, cool (250 degrees F.) oven for one hour.  When
  cooked, turn the oven off, leave the oven door slightly ajar, and allow to
  cool slowly in the oven. This slow cooling works to prevent the loss of too
  much height. Serve cold, with whipped cream and fresh fruit pieces,
  strawberries and kiwi fruit for example.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Australian meringue dessert.
  
  *  Cornflour is known in North America as cornstarch.  Castor sugar is
  known there as granulated sugar.
  
  *  Make sure that you start off with a clean bowl and beat the egg whites
  well.  A bowl with smooth sides (glass, metal) will help the eggs to whip
  up. A plastic bowl with scratches prevents the eggs from attaining a very
  light texture. Also ensure that the sugar is fully dissolved before going
  on to the next step. I have never had troubles from over-whipping. The
  final texture should be meringue on the inside with a thin crust on the
  outside.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, 1 hour cooling.

      Title: Peanut Butter Meringue Cream Pie
 Categories: Pies & past
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           9 inch pie shell; baked
  2 1/2 c  Milk; scalded
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Flour, all-purpose
    1/8 ts Ground ginger
      2    Egg yolks; beaten
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Peanut butter
           Meringue:
      3 lg Egg whites; room temp
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
    1/4 ts Cream of tartar
      6 tb Superfine sugar
 
   Prepare the prebaked pie shell; cool completely.  In the top of a double
  boiler set over simmering water, combine 1/2 cup of the hot milk with the
  sugar and flour. Add 1 1/2 cups of hot milk to the mixture in the double
  boiler and cook, stirring frequently, for 20 minutes or until thickened.
  Stir a small amount of the hot custard into the egg yolks. Combine the egg
  yolk mixture with the mixture in the double boiler. Cook for 2 minutes
  more.  Remove the pan from the heat. Add the vanilla. Beat the peanut
  butter with the remaining milk. Add the peanut butter mixture to the hot
  custard. Turn the filling into the pie shell. Preheat the oven to 350
  degrees. While the filling is still hot, prepare the meringue. Beat the egg
  whites, vanilla, and cream of tartar until the mixture holds stiff peaks.
  Gradually add the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until very stiff
  and glossy. All the sugar must be dissolved. Spread the meringue over the
  hot filling, sealing it to the edge of the crust. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or
  until golden brown. Cool, and chill until serving.

  combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar and butter until well blended.
  Press evenly into a buttered 9" pie pan, reaching up to but not over the
  rim.  Bake until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Cool the crust
  completely on a wire rack. Beat the cream cheese and peanut butter with an
  electric mixer at medium speed until well blended. Add the powdered sugar,
  butter and vanilla and continue beating until fluffy. Whip the cream until
  not quite stiff. Fold a large spoonful of the whipped cream into the peanut
  butter mixture to lighten it; gently fold in the remainder. Carefully spoon
  the filling into the cooled crust, spreading evenly. Loosely cover the pie
  and refrigerate until firm, about 3 hours. (You can put it in the freezer,
  if you'd like to speed it up.) Bring the cream to a simmer in a small,
  heavy saucepan. Add the chocolate and stir until smooth. Set aside to cool
  to lukewarm. Gently spread the topping over the cooled pie. Refrigerate
  until firm, about 3 hours. Serve cold.

      Title: Pear-On-Pear Tart
 Categories: Fruit, Pies & past
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/8 ts Salt
           Sugar
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter
      1    Egg yolk
  2 1/2 tb Ice water (approximately)
      8    Ripe pears (comice/anjou)
           (about 3 pounds)
      1 ts Ground ginger
    1/3 c  Apricot preserves
 
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  To make the pastry:  Combine the flour with
  the salt and 2 tablespoons of sugar in a large bowl.  Cut in the butter
  with a knife.  Blend with a pastry blender until the flour has the texture
  of coarse crumbs.  Combine the egg yolk with the ice water and work into
  the flour mixture to form a soft dough.  Add more water if necessary. Knead
  briefly and press the dough over the bottom and sides of a buttered loose
  bottomed 10-inch quiche pan.  Trim the edges. Line the pastry with aluminum
  foil and weight with rice or beans. Bake 10 minutes. Remove foil and rice
  or beans; bake until the pastry is golden, 5 to 10 minutes. Cool on a rack.
  
   To make the caramel:  Combine 1/3 cup of sugar with 2 tablespoons water in
  a medium skillet.  Heat to boiling and boil until the mixture turns a light
  caramel color.  Carefully, but quickly, brush the caramel over the bottom
  and sides of the pastry shell.
  
   To make filling:  Peel 6 of the pears, cut in half, and remove the cores.
  Cut each half into 4 slices.  Place the pears in a large heavy skillet or
  saucepan.  combine 2/3 cup sugar, the ginger, and 1 cup water and pour over
  the pears.  Heat to boiling; reduce the heat. Simmer, covered, until pears
  are soft but not mushy, 6-8 minutes, depending on ripeness of pears. Cool.
  
   Drain the pears, reserving the liquid.  Arrange the pears over the bottom
  of the pastry shell.
  
   Peel the remaining pears, cut into quarters, and remove the cores. Cut
  each quarter into thin slices.  Arange symmetrically over the cooked pears.
  
   Combine the apricot preserves with 4 tablespoons of the pear liquid in a
  small saucepan.  Heat to boiling; strain.
  
   Brush the tart with half the apricot mixture.  Bake 30 minutes. Remove
  from oven and brush with the remaining apricot mixture.  Serve slightly
  warmed with whipped cream if desired. Source: Bert Greene in "Christmas

      Title: Pecan Pumpkin Pie
 Categories: Holiday, Usenet, Pies & past
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
-----------------------------------CRUST-----------------------------------
      1    Pastry pie shell,
           -flaky, 9-inch
           -(uncooked)

-------------------------------PUMPKIN LAYER-------------------------------
    3/4 c  Pumpkin
      2 T  Light brown sugar,
           -packed
      1 lg Egg
      2 T  Sour cream
    1/8 t  Cinnamon
    1/8 t  Nutmeg, grated

--------------------------------PECAN LAYER--------------------------------
    3/4 c  Corn syrup, light
    1/2 c  Light brown sugar,
           -packed
      3 lg Eggs
      3 T  Butter (unsalted),
           -melted and cooled
  1 1/3 c  Pecans
      2 t  Vanilla
    1/4 t  Lemon rind, grated
  1 1/2 t  Lemon juice
    1/4 t  Salt
 
  Prepare pie shell.  Keep chilled.
  
  Whisk together until smooth pumpkin, about 2 T brown sugar, 1 egg, sour
  cream, cinnamon and nutmeg.
  
  In another bowl, combine corn syrup, about 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3 eggs,
  about 3 T butter, vanilla, lemon rind, lemon juice and salt. Stir in
  pecans.
  
  Spread the pumpkin layer into the pie shell, then carefully spoon the pecan
  mixture over it.  Bake in the upper third of a preheated 425 degree F. oven
  for 20 minutes, then reduce to 350 degrees F. for 20-30 minutes more. The
  filling will puff slightly, but the center will not be completely set. Cool
  on a rack.  Serve warm or at room temperature. Reheat in a preheated 350
  degree F. oven for 10 to 15 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pecan-pumpkin pie -- This pie is not as terribly sweet as straight pecan
  pie, and less ordinary than pumpkin pie.  The recipe came originally from
  _Gourmet_ magazine.  Yield:  1 pie.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: Pecan Tarts
 Categories: Desserts, Holiday, Usenet, Pies & past
      Yield: 4 Dozen
 
-----------------------------------PASTRY-----------------------------------
      6 oz Cream cheese
    1/2 lb Butter (or margarine)
      2 c  Flour, all-purpose

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      3 c  Brown sugar
      2 t  Vanilla
      1 c  Pecans, chopped
      4    Eggs, beaten
      4 T  Butter (or margarine),
           -melted
 
  Allow the butter and cream cheese to soften.  Mix cream cheese and butter
  with a mixer until fluffy. Then (using your hands) mix in the flour.
  Separate mixture into four equal parts and flatten each into a rectangular
  shape. Allow the pastry to chill for several hours.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Prepare filling by mixing all ingredients
  gently.  Use a spoon, not a mixer.  Refrigerate until muffin tins are ready
  to fill.
  
  Take one unit of the chilled pastry and cut into 12 equal pieces. Roll each
  piece into a ball and then form the ball into the muffin tin in the shape
  of a crust. Fill each tart about 3/4 full. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 20 to
  30 minutes.
  
  Bake these until slightly brown.  To remove tarts, just turn the tin upside
  down onto paper towels and then turn the tart right side up on a baking
  rack to cool.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Miniature pecan pies cooked in bite-size individual crusts in tiny
  muffin tins -- They are quite delicious.
  
  *  You will need to purchase tiny muffin tins, sometimes called "nugget
  pans," to make these tarts. They are inexpensive and you can use these for
  various other things. It is best to purchase enough to make four dozen at
  once. The entire four dozen will fit into the oven on one rack! It is best
  to spray these tins with cooking oil before putting the crust in.
  
  *  There is a wooden utensil called a "tart-tamper" that is a real
  time-saver for this recipe. It might be difficult to find. It is used to
  smash the ball to fit the tin so you don't spend a lot of time using your
  fingers.  You dip the tip of the tamper in flour each time to prevent
  sticking to the pastry. It also makes the pastry look much more uniform and
  professional.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy if you have a tart tamper; moderate otherwise.
  : Time:  15 minutes pastry preparation; several hours chilling; 1 hour
  filling, baking and cooling.
  : Precision:  Be precise for the pastry, filling may be approximate.

      Title: Persimmon Pie
 Categories: Pies & past, Fruit, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Pie
 
      1    Unbaked 9-inch pie crust
      2 c  Persimmon puree
      1 tb Flour
    1/3 c  Honey
      1 tb Sorghum
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
    1/8 ts Allspice
      3 ea Eggs
      1 c  Evaporated milk
 
  Brush crust with egg white from one of the eggs; set aside.  Mix persimmon
  with flour, honey, sorghum and spices.  Beat in eggs and milk. Pour into
  prepared pie crust.  Bake at 400F 40-50 minutes until pie doesn't jiggle
  when shaken.  Cover edges with circle of foil if crust begins to brown too
  much.
  
  Native persimmons are so sweet that they have also been called wild figs or
  sugar plums.  The English word persimmon is said to have come from the
  Algonquin word pessemin.  Like apricots, persimmons contain ample amounts
  of vitamins A and C.  The easiest way to get persimmon pulp is to puree
  fully ripe persimmons using a food mill or a Chinaman sieve. Aluminum or
  plastic sieves are best since iron or tin will turn the rosey orange pulp
  dark.  Freeze any you don't use now for use later in winter and spring.
  When ripe, persimmons are very soft and take on a dusty pale lavender cast.
  Persimmon pulp can be used in any pumpkin recipe with similar results. It
  marries well with cinnamon, nutmeg and orange. Since it is not as think as
  pumpkin, adding a little flour to pie fillings is a good idea.

    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Milk
      2 tb Unsalted butter; melted

  Recipe by: Williams Sonoma 1994 Holiday Catalog Butter a 6-cup popover or
  Texas-sized muffin pan.
  
  In a medium bowl lightly wisk together the eggs and salt.  Stir in the milk
  and butter and beat in the flour until just blended.  DO NOT OVERBEAT!  Fil
  each cup about half full using all the batter.
  
  Place popovers in a cold oven, set the temperature to 425 degrees F and bak
  for 20 minutes.  Popovers should rise considerably during this time.  Reduc
  oven to 375 F and continue baking 10-15 minutes longer until popovers are
  golden and crisp on the outside.  Quickly pierce each popover with a thin
  metal skewer or the tip of a small knife to release the steam.  Turn the ov
  off and leave in for 5-10 minutes more for further crisping.  Remove and
  serve at once.
  
  Makes 6 popovers which are about 142 calories each.

      Title: Poppyseed Bundt Cake
 Categories: Cakes, Usenet
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Butter (or margarine)
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
  2 1/2 c  Flour (sift
           -before measuring)
      1 t  Baking soda
      2 t  Baking powder
      1 c  Buttermilk
      2 oz Poppy seeds
           -(about 1/4 cup)
      1 t  Almond extract
           -(or vanilla extract)
      4    Eggs (separated)
    1/4 c  Brown sugar
      1 t  Cinnamon
 
  Soak poppyseed in the buttermilk for 15 minutes.
  
  Cream together butter and sugar.  Add yolks to creamed mixture.  Add almond
  extract or vanilla.  Add dry ingredients alternately with buttermilk
  mixture, a little at a time.
  
  Beat egg whites very stiff as for angel food.  Fold egg whites into
  mixture. Pour half of this batter mixture into well-greased Bundt pan.
  Sprinkle with a mixture of about 1/4 cup brown sugar and about 1 t
  cinnamon.  Pour in remaining batter. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 1 hour.
  Cool and invert onto serving dish, then remove Bundt pan.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A light, delicate cake -- I got this recipe from my mom.  I'm not sure
  where she got it.
  
  *  When folding in egg whites, be gentle.  Lift and turn the batter instead
  of using a stirring motion. Don't worry if a little bit of egg white
  remains unmixed; the egg whites will collapse if you mix it too much.
  
  *  I have tried both vanilla and almond extracts with this recipe, and
  prefer the former.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate (folding the beaten egg whites into the
  batter takes some skill).
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, 1 hour cooling.
  : Precision:  Measure carefully.

  Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.  Mix graham cracker crumbs, walnuts, sugar,
  about 1/4 t of the pumpkin pie spice, and the butter.  Press evenly into
  the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan. Bake 10 minutes, then cool. (Leave
  the oven on).
  
  Mix cottage cheese and eggs in a blender until smooth.  Beat the cream

      1 c  Flour
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 t  Vanilla
      1    Egg yolk
    1/4 c  Butter, softened

      1 c  Sugar

    3/4 t  Allspice, ground
    3/4 t  Ginger, ground
    1/2 t  Cinnamon, ground

      2    Egg yolks
      5    Eggs
      1 t  Vanilla extract
    1/4 c  Cream, heavy
 
  MAKE PASTRY:  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Grease the bottom and
  sides of a 9-inch-diameter, 3-inch deep springform pan.
  
  Prepare the pastry by stirring flour and sugar together in a bowl. Cut in
  butter, egg yolk and extract.  Work the dough (which will be very crumbly)
  with hands to complete the mixing.  Evenly press the dough on the bottom
  and up the sides (to within about 1/2 inch of the top) of the springform
  pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, or until golden brown.
  Remove and set aside to cool while preparing the filling.
  
  MAKE FILLING:  Increase the oven temperature to 475 degrees F.  Beat the
  cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth and soft. Beat in the sugars,
  flour, spices and pumpkin until well blended. Add egg yolks and eggs one at
  a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla extract, beat in
  well. Stir in the cream.
  
  Pour filling into the pastry crust.  Bake for 12 minutes.  Without opening
  the oven door, reduce the oven temperature to 200 degrees F. and leave the
  cheesecake in the oven for an additional 1 hour and 15 minutes. At the end
  of the baking time, turn off the oven, but leave the cheesecake sitting
  inside (without opening the door) until the oven cools (about 2 to 3
  hours). Remove from the oven, refrigerate overnight.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A holiday alternative to pumpkin pie -- This cheesecake has to be tried
  to be believed. It was developed by Karen Reynolds, a charming lady, fine
  programmer and amazing cook.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, several hours baking.

      2 T  Butter, melted
  1 3/4 c  Pumpkin (one
           -standard can)
      2    Eggs
      2 T  Flour
      1 c  Evaporated milk
    1/2 c  Sugar, dark brown
    1/2 c  White sugar
      1 t  Ginger
      1 t  Cinnamon
    1/4 t  Mace
    1/4 t  Cloves, ground
    1/2 t  Salt
      1    Pie shell (standard),
           -uncooked
 
  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.  Beat the eggs until frothy.  Mix in the
  sugars and the flour.  Mix in the spices and the salt.  Mix in the pumpkin.
  Mix in the melted butter.  Finally, mix in the milk.

  Decrease heat to 375 degrees F. and bake for an additional 45 minutes.
  Remove the pie from the oven and set it out to cool.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A Pumpkin Pie with flour -- This is my mother's recipe for her
  traditional Thanksgiving dinner pumpkin pie. It is different from most
  other pumpkin pie recipes in that flour and brown sugar are used in the
  batter.  Even my wife, who is not a big pumpkin pie fan, thought this was a
  yummy pie.
  
  When my parents first got married, every pumpkin pie my mom made for my dad
  was rejected with the comment "it's not like mother used to make." She even
  tried to use his mother's recipe, but she could not follow it: his mother
  used ordinary kitchen utensils for measuring devices (like a teacup for a
  "cup," a real table spoon for a "tablespoon," etc.). She finally found a
  recipe that looked similar to grandma's. Through the years she has altered
  it slightly to make the pie even more tastier.
  
  *  Don't be surprised if the pie rises slightly.  It will go down again
  after it cools.
  
  *  Make sure you get just pumpkin.  Don't use a can of "pumpkin pie mix"
  instead!  If you were very ambitious, you could gut a pumpkin yourself for
  this recipe, but I have never had the time or courage to do that.
  
  *  You can buy a pie shell crust or you can make your own. Certainly, the
  results are better when you make your own.
  
  *  Light brown sugar can be used instead of dark, but the result isn't as
  good.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, plus desired cooling time.
  : Precision:  measure the ingredients, especially the spices.

      Title: Pumpkin Pie with Praline
 Categories: Pies & past
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -PRALINE (OPTIONAL)
      2 T  (1/4 stick) butte, softened
    1/3 c  Chopped pecans
    1/3 c  Brown sugar
           -
      2    Unbaked 8 inch pie shells,
           -or one
           -Unbaked 10 inch pie shell
      2 T  (1/4 stick) butter
      1    29 oz. can pumpkin puree
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
      1 T  All purpose flour
      1 T  Bitters (optional)
      1 t  Ground cinnamon
    1/2 t  Ground ginger
    1/2 t  Salt
    1/4 t  Grated nutmeg
    1/4 t  Ground cloves
      1    Egg, beaten
      1    12 oz. can evaporated milk
    1/4 c  Milk
      1 c  Water
 
  Prepare the praline filling, if desired.  Preheat oven to 450 F. In a small
  bowl, creme together the butter and brown sugar. Blend in the pecans. Press
  firmly into the bottom of the unbaked pie shells.  Bake for 10 minutes,
  watching carefully so crusts do not puff up or slip down. Prick puffs with
  a fork if you see this happening, and pat the slipping crusts back up in
  place with the back of a fork. (This may not happen, but if it does, that
  is what you should do.) Let cool before filling. Preheat oven to 400 F.
  Melt the butter in a large skillet; add the pumpkin puree. Simmer for 10
  minutes, stirring now and then with a wooden spoon. In a large mixer bowl,
  mix together the next 9 ingredients. Add the egg, and mix again. Add the
  hot pumpkin gradually, then blend in the milks and water. Pour into pie
  shells and bake for 1 hour. Let cool completely before cutting. NOTE: The
  filling can be made a day in advance and refrigerated.  If you've used the
  praline, you may have extra pumpkin filling; bake it in individual custard
  cups.

  I made this and it was quite tasty.  To cut down on the fat more I just
  sprinkled some graham crumbs in some dessert cups and poured the filling
  mix in those, them sprinked a few more crumbs on top.  I used much less
  crumbs this way also.

      Title: Rum/bourbon Balls
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 2 Dozen
 
      3 c  Vanilla Wafers
           -(crushed)
      1 c  Sugar, powered
  1 1/2 c  Nuts, chopped
  1 1/2 t  Cocoa powder
      2 T  Corn syrup, white
           -(honey also works well)
    1/2 c  Rum or Bourbon
 
  Mix all dry ingredients and set aside.
  
  Mix corn syrup or honey with rum or bourbon to thin the syrup.  Blend wet
  mixture into dry ingredients with fork.  Mix well.  Allow to sit for 1-2
  hours.
  
  At this point, if you let it sit a couple of hours, you can come back and
  add another about 1/2 cup of rum or bourbon and let sit again. This process
  may be repeated a few times to your taste. The last time, the mix should
  sit a couple of hours so it's not really moist. There's a good midpoint
  between too moist and too dry where rolling into balls won't be difficult
  (too wet) or cause crumbling (too dry).
  
  Roll into balls, then roll in powered sugar to make a sugar coating. When
  rolling in powered sugar, the moister they are, the more sugar will be
  absorbed over time.  They may need another roll in the sugar right before
  serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Intoxicating chocolate snack with rum or bourbon -- I got this from my
  mom who uses more alcohol than the original recipe called for but less than
  I like to use. It makes a great party snack. Yield: Makes about 30 small
  balls.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  1/2 to 1 hour preparation; 3 or more hours waiting.

      Title: Second Day Apple Squares
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      2 c  White flour, unbleached
      2 c  Brown sugar, firmly packed
    1/2 c  Butter (or margarine)
      1 c  Chopped nuts (optional)
      2 t  Cinnamon (or less)
      1 t  Soda
    1/2 t  Salt
      1 c  Sour cream (or yogurt)
      1 t  Vanilla extract
      1    Egg
      2 c  Apples, peeled and
           -finely chopped
           -(about 2 apples)
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a large bowl, combine the flour, brown
  sugar and margarine.  Blend at low speed, until the mixture forms fine
  crumbs. If you want to include them, stir in the nuts now. Place about 2
  3/4 cups of the crumb mixture into an ungreased pan, about 13 x 9 inches.
  Press down firmly.
  
  Add the remaining ingredients (except for the apples) to the remaining
  crumb mixture. Blend well. Stir the chopped apples into the batter. Spoon
  the batter evenly over the crumb base in the pan. Bake at 350 degrees F.
  for 30-40 minutes. If you use the larger pan, bake for 25-30 minutes. Cool
  before cutting.  Better yet, let it wait 24 hours before cutting. Store
  loosely covered.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Sugary, moist apple squares -- Try to avoid eating very many of these
  squares on the day you make them, as they improve immeasurably on the
  second and third day! This recipe originally came from a Pillsbury
  bake-off. Yield: Makes 12-15 squares.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 40 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

  sugar-spice mixture and dot with a little butter. Continue until all

  flute edges and cut vents. Bake in hot oven (425 degrees) 30-40 minutes. If
  potatoes are still not tender reduce temperture to 350 F. and continue
  baking until done. Note: I tried the above baking directions and got a
  rather brown crust. When I tried baking it at an initial temp. of 425 F.
  for 15 minutes and reducing it to 325 F. afterwards for 45 minutes more, I
  got a better crust and the filling was always cooked...

      8 tb Butter;unsalted
           ;cut into 1/4" bits; chilled
      3 tb Shortening;Vegetable,chilled
  2 1/4 c  Flour; all purpose
    1/4 ts Salt
      5 tb Water; iced; more as needed

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      2 c  Almonds; Finely ground
      4 ts Milk
      6 tb Rasberry Jam
      6 tb Cherry Jam
      2    Egg yolks
    1/3 c  Sour Cream
      2 ts Cinnamon
      1 tb Butter;softened
 
  Pastry: In a large mixing bowl, combine the butter, vegetable shortening,
  flour and salt. Working quickly, use your fingertips to rub flour and fat
  together until they blend and look like flakes of course meal. Pour ice
  water over over mixture all at once, toss together lightly and gather dough
  into a ball. If dough crumbles, add up to 2 more tablespoons per batch you
  are making, drop by drop until particles adhere. Divide the dough in half,
  dust each half lightly with flour and wrap separately in sheets of wax
  paper. Refrigerate at least 3 hours until firm.
  
  Filling: Soak the almonds in milk for 5-10 minutes. With the back of a
  large spoon, rub the jams through a fine seive set over a large bowl. THen
  beat in it the egg yolks, sour cream, cinnamon, the nuts and their soaking
  milk. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 12" circle about
  1/8" thick. With a pastry brush, coat the bottom and sides of a 9" false
  bottom tart pan with the softened butter. Gently press the pastry into the
  bottom and around the sides of the pan, being careful not to stretch it.
  Roll the pin over the rim of the pan, pressing down hard to trim off excess
  pastry. Preheat oven to 425. Pour the filling into the pastry shell and
  roll out other half of dough into a 12" circle. Drape it over the rolling
  pin, lift it up and unfold it over the filling. Press the edges of the
  pastry layers together. Then crimp them with your fingers or press them
  firmly around the rim with the prongs of a fork.. With a sharp knife, cut 3
  slits about 1" apart in the top of the pastry. Bake in the center of the
  oven for 30 minutes or until pastry is golden brown. Then set the pan on a
  large jar or coffee can and carefully slip off the outside rim. Let the pie
  cool to room temperature before serving.
  
  * This is a tasty and QUICK pie if you use commercial premade pie crusts,
  although you should make it at least once from scratch

      Yield: 1 Cake
 
    1/2 c  Shortening
    3/4 c  Sugar
      1 t  Vanilla
      3 lg Eggs
      2 c  Flour, sifted
      1 t  Baking powder
      1 t  Baking soda
    1/2 pt Sour cream
      6 T  Butter, softened
      1 c  Light brown sugar,
           -firmly packed
      2 t  Cinnamon
      1 c  Nuts, chopped
           -(walnuts or pecans)
 
  Prepare a 10-inch tube pan.  I use one with a removable center. Grease the
  pan and cut a circle of waxed paper to cover the bottom. Preheat oven to
      350    degrees.
  
  Cream shortening, sugar and vanilla, thoroughly.  Add eggs, singly, beating
  well after each addition.
  
  Sift flour, baking powder and baking soda together.  Add flour mixture and
  sour cream to creamed mixture.  Alternate a little of each, blending after
  each addition.
  
  In separate bowl, cream butter, brown sugar and cinnamon together. Add nuts
  and mix well.
  
  Spread 1/2 of the batter in the tube pan.  Sprinkle 1/2 of the nut mixture
  evenly over batter in pan.  Cover with remaining batter. Sprinkle with
  remaining nut mixture.  Bake in preheated oven for about 50 minutes.
  
  When the cake cools, run a knife around the side of the pan and remove the
  inner section.  Carefully remove the cake from the base of the pan and
  remove the waxed paper.

      Title: Southern Cream Apple Pie
 Categories: Usenet, Pies & past
      Yield: 2 Pies
 
------------------------------------PIE------------------------------------
     22 oz Tart apples
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Flour
      3 c  Sour cream
      2    Eggs, beaten
      1 t  Vanilla
      2    Pastry shells,
           -deep-dish, about
           -9 inches wide

----------------------------------TOPPING----------------------------------
  1 1/8 c  Sugar
    3/4 c  Flour
  1 1/2 t  Cinnamon
    1/2 c  Butter
 
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  In a large bowl, combine the sugar,
  flour, sour cream, eggs and vanilla into a smooth mixture.
  
  Core, peel and chop the apples.  Boil them in a small amount of water with
  a little lemon juice for 3 to 5 minutes until they begin to get tender.
  Drain apples and add to the mixture.
  
  Pour into two 9-inch pastry shells.  Bake at 400 degrees F. for 30 minutes.
  
  While pies are baking, crumble topping ingredients into a bowl and mix with

  boss, Dick Dolan, the editor of the _Hewlett Packard Journal_. It is
  sinfully delicious and never lasts very long, even if you don't have help
  eating it!

      Title: Spanish Cream
 Categories: Desserts, New zealand, Usenet
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Milk
           -(one Imperial pint)
      4 t  Gelatine
      2    Eggs
    1/2 t  Vanilla essence
    1/3 c  Sugar
 
  Save a small amount of the milk; put the rest in a saucepan, together with
  the sugar and vanilla and heat.
  
  Separate the egg whites and save for later.  Beat the egg yolks with the
  remainder of the milk and add to the heating mixture.
  
  Stir to ensure the sugar is dissolved and bring to near boiling point to
  thoroughly cook the eggs.  Do not actually boil.  Take the saucepan off the
  heat.  Dissolve the gelatine in about 1/4 cup of boiling water and stir
  into hot custard. Pour into serving dish and put into refrigerator to cool.
  
  When mixture has cooled and almost set (it should be shivery at this point)
  thoroughly beat the egg whites until stiff and fold them in using a metal
  spoon.  Return mixture to refrigerator to properly set.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Exquisite New Zealand custard dessert -- This dessert was a family
  favourite, and although we used to eat it in conjunction with some flavored
  jellies, it's delicious in its  own right.  The recipe comes from my
  mother, and I don't know what the Spanish part signifies.
  
  *  The texture of this dessert is supposed to be semi-fluffy.  If you fold
  in the egg whites too soon, the liquid custard won't support them and you
  end up with a two-layer result, solid custard on top, very light on the
  bottom. Some people may like this, but it's not the way I make it. On the
  other hand, if you leave things too long, it becomes difficult to fold in
  the egg whites at all.
  
  *  It's a good idea to whip the custard a little with a fork prior to
  folding in the whites. This breaks up the custard a little.
  
  *  Depending on sweetness of taste, you may wish to alter the amount of
  sugar. Our family had a sweet tooth, and I've reduced the original quantity
  as it is.
  
  *  One of the amazing things about this dessert is that it's so easy to
  make, and yet tastes so good.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes + setting.

      Title: Strawberry-Rhubarb Pie
 Categories: Usenet, Pies & past
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
---------------------------------PIE CRUST---------------------------------
  2 1/4 c  Flour
    3/4 c  Shortening
      5 T  Milk, cold
           -(can use water)

--------------------------------PIE FILLING--------------------------------
      1 c  Sugar
      1 lb Rhubarb, cut into
           -1/2-inch pieces
      6 c  Strawberries (or less)
      6 T  Tapioca (tapioca
           -starch preferred,
           -but quick-cooking
           -tapioca is okay, too)
 
  Cut the strawberries in half.  Place in a bowl with the rhubarb and add the
  sugar and tapioca.  Mix and let sit for at least 15 minutes. Make the pie
  crust:  Cut the shortening and flour together.  This can be done with two
  knives, with a pastry cutter, or with some electric mixers. (I do mine in a
  Kitchen Aid food processor/mixer.) When the mixture has an even consistency
  (it should resemble coarse sand), add in the milk (or water). Take about
  5/8ths of the dough and roll out on a floured board until it is a little
  bit larger than a 10-inch pie pan. Put this in the pie pan. (The rest of
  the dough is for the top of the pie.)
  
  Pour the strawberries and rhubarb mixture into the pie crust.  Roll out the
  remainder of the pie crust.  Place on top of the pie, crimping the edges of
  the top and bottom crusts together.  Make one or two slits in the top of
  the crust for steam to escape. Bake 45 to 50 minutes at 400 degrees F. or
  until Ayrup boils with heavy bubbles that do not burst.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A sweet and tart dessert, this recipe came from the _Los Angeles Times_
  about 15 years ago.
  
  *  Strawberries and rhubarb are both seasonal fruits.  Their season is late
  spring/early summer.
  
  *  You can use about 3/4 cup sugar if you like it less sweet.
  
  *  I recommend putting a piece of aluminum foil under the pie as it is
  cooking, because it invariably leaks.  This will save you from having to
  clean up the oven.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  Preparation:  20-25 minutes; baking:  45-50 minutes; cooling: 30
  minutes.
  : Precision:  Measure the crust ingredients!

      Title: Sugar Cookies
 Categories: Cookies, Usenet
      Yield: 10 Dozen
 
      1 c  Butter, softened
      1 c  Salad oil
      1 c  Sugar, powdered
           -(sifted if it is lumpy)
      1 c  Sugar
      2    Eggs
      1 t  Vanilla
      4 c  Flour
      1 t  Baking soda
      2 t  Cream of tartar
    1/2 t  Salt
           Extra sugar
           -(for dipping)
 
  Cream the butter and sugars, then add oil and mix well.  Add the eggs and
  vanilla and mix well.
  
  Sift the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar and salt together, then add to
  above and mix well.  Refrigerate overnight, or until dough is firm. If you
  want to speed this up, put the dough in the freezer, but keep an eye on it.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Drop dough in 1/2 t amounts on an ungreased
  cookie sheet.  Dip a glass in dough and wipe excess off. Then dip the glass
  in sugar and flatten a cookie. Repeat the dip-in-sugar flatten-cookie
  sequence until all are done.  The cookies won't spread in baking, so you
  can easily judge how far apart to put them (you want room to cook, but not
  to grow). If you find that the dough is getting too soft to flatten easily,
  put it in the refrigerator between batches.
  
  Bake for about 5-6 minutes, until the edges are JUST beginning to turn
  golden brown. Take off the cookie sheet and put on waxed paper or foil to
  cool.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Delicate and buttery sugar cookies.
  
  *  You can add 2-3 T cocoa to about 1 1/2 cups dough for chocolate cookies,
  or add cinnamon to the dipping sugar for spice cookies. I like the sugar
  cookies plain, so I've never actually tried this.
  
  *  These cookies don't freeze well, because they pick up the flavors of the
  other things in the freezer.  Make only as many as you can eat before they
  go stale.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 8 or more hours in refrigerator, 30
  minutes final preparation and baking.
  : Precision:  Measure the ingredients.

      Title: Superior Whipping Cream
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 2 Cups
 
    1/2 c  Whipping cream
      2 t  Vanilla sugar
           -(or use white sugar
           -and about 1/2 t
           -vanilla extract)
 
  Shake the carton of whipping cream well and pour it into the blender or
  food processor. Add the vanilla sugar (see below if you don't know what
  vanilla sugar is.)
  
  Whip the cream in the machine.  If it's a food processor, leave the pushing
  device out; if a blender, remove the center of the lid, or just cover the
  top of the jar with your hand. The trick is to allow lots of air into the
  cream. Run the machine for no more than five seconds at a time, to avoid
  making butter. The cream is done when it holds a peak.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple way to make whipped cream extra yummy -- There is almost no
  dessert that can't be improved by adding a dollop of whipping cream.
  Unfortunately, most people seem to be  afraid of actually whipping the
  cream, so they buy the awful stuff that comes in a pressurized can, or
  spend money on expensive devices to inject gas into the cream. (Or worse,
  they use Cool Whip.) The truth is that making your own whipped cream is

  *  If you don't know what vanilla sugar is, don't panic.  My mother makes
  this variation in a separate sugar container; fill the container with
  sugar, add a vanilla bean and wait. After a week or two, the sugar will
  take on the vanilla flavor. Use this sugar whenever a recipe calls for
  sugar and vanilla extract; just remember to keep the container full.
  
  *  If you don't have vanilla sugar around, use regular sugar and vanilla
  extract for the cream.

      Title: Sweet Potato Pie
 Categories: Holiday, Usenet, Pies & past
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Sweet potatoes
      1 c  Sugar, granulated
     12 T  Butter, unsalted
           -(or use corn-oil
           -margarine)
      2    Eggs
      1 t  Vanilla
    1/2 t  Nutmeg
      1    Pie crust, unbaked
 
  Boil potatoes until tender (20-30 minutes).  Drain and peel.
  
  In a blender, put the potatoes, sugar and butter.  Mix up a little, then
  add eggs, vanilla and nutmeg. Blend ingredients together well, until
  mixture is very smooth. Pour into unbaked pie shell and bake at 375 degrees
  F. for 45-55 minutes until filling is set.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  This is an extremely simple and extremely good pie recipe.  You can even
  cheat and use store-bought pie crusts, in which case the whole thing takes
  about 5 minutes to put together.  Yield:  Serves 3-8.
  
  *  If you don't want to make your own pie shell, I find that the Pet Ritz
  factory pie shells work well.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.

      3 T  Sugar
    1/3 c  Butter, melted
      3 t  Cornstarch
    2/3 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Water, cold
      2 lb Grapes, seedless (green),

      1 T  Lemon juice
      1 c  Sour cream
      1 T  Sugar
      1 t  Vanilla extract
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Combine cracker crumbs, about 3 T sugar and

    1/2 ts Ground Nutmeg
    1/2 ts Ground Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Ground Allspice
    1/2 ts Ground Cloves
      1 ds Salt
      4 lg Egg Yellows (Yolks)
      2 lg Egg Whites
      1 c  Sugar

      1 c  Coarsely Chopped Walnuts Or
           -Pecans
      1 c  Raisins
 
  Prepare an unbaked single pie crust. NOTE: This is a version (Updated
  slightly) of a very old recipe.  It was used by many a farmer's wife and
  frontier wife to use up sour milk and cream for a dessert. The vinegar is
  used to preserve the pie where there was no refrigeration. It is basically
  a spice custard pie.
  
  Prepare the pastry and line a 9-inch pie pan.  Chill while making the
  filling.
  
  Sift the flour, spices, and salt together and set aside
  
  Beat the egg yellows thoroughly.  Wash and dry the beater, then beat the 2
  egg whites until they stand in peaks. Gently fold the sugar into the egg
  whites and stir into the yellows. Add the flour mixture alternately with
  the sour cream.
  
  Combine the butter, vinegar, nuts, and raisins and stir into the filling.
  Pour into the pie shell and bake in a preheated 450 degree F. Oven for 10
  minutes.  Reduce the heat to 400 degrees F. and bake 5 minutes. Then turn
  the heat down to 350 degrees F. and continue baking for about 15 minutes or
  until the filling is set. Cool. May be served with whipped cream, if
  desired.

      Title: Waffle Cone
 Categories: Desserts, Usenet
      Yield: 20 Cones
 
      3    Eggs
    3/4 c  Sugar, granulated
    1/2 c  Butter, melted
      2 t  Vanilla
  1 1/2 c  Flour
      2 t  Baking powder
 
  Beat the eggs and gradually beat in the sugar until the mixture is creamy.
  Stir in the melted butter and vanilla.
  
  Combine the flour and baking powder, and then add it to the mixture. Blend
  it in well.
  
  Drop about 4 t of the batter into a heated pizelle iron, and cook both
  sides over medium-high heat for about 1 minute each, or until golden brown.
  
  Remove the waffle from the pizelle iron and immediately shape it into a
  cone while it is still pliable.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Waffle ice-cream cone, pizelles -- This recipe comes from a recent issue
  of _Canadian Living_ magazine. Waffle cones look like round waffles shaped
  into a cone and have a wonderful taste. (I admit it, I'm hooked on them.)
  This recipe is actually for a type of cookie called the pizelle, but it
  tastes just like the waffle cones you can get at an ice-cream parlor.
  Yield:  about 20 cones.
  
  *  A pizelle iron looks like a round waffle iron.  There are "manual" irons
  and electric ones too.  If you don't have a pizelle iron, another idea is
  to use an ordinary waffle iron and have ice-cream on top of the waffle. Not
  having either a waffle iron or a pizelle iron, we tried making these on an
  electric griddle, but since the batter is fairly thick it wouldn't spread
  into a large enough circle to make cones from.
  
  *  When you form the cones, there will probably be a small hole in the
  bottom of them that ice-cream can drip out of. One idea for plugging this
  hole is to put miniature marshmallows in the bottoms of the cones.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1-2 minutes (per cone) cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      4    Egg whites
    1/4 t  Cream of tartar
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/4 t  Salt
 
  Mix first four ingredients in the top of a double boiler.  Place over, but
  not touching water.  Bring water to a boil.  Mix egg yolks, cornstarch and
  remaining 1/2 c sugar together and add to custard mixture in pan. Bring to
  a boil and cook until thickened, stirring frequently. (This will take some
  time, about 15 minutes.  As it begins to cook it gets lumpy, but will
  smooth out as it thickens.) Mix butter, vanilla and almond extract together
  and add to thickened custard. Pour into baked and cooled pie shell. Top
  with meringue: Beat egg whites until stiff. Mix salt, cream of tartar and
  sugar together and add a little at a time to egg whites. Beat mixture until
  stiff and stands in peaks.  Spread over pie being sure to touch crust all
  around.  Bake at 350 degrees until golden brown, about 20 minutes.

  (about 2 T should be enough). Bake for about 20 minutes at 375 degrees F.
  If you remove the cookies from the oven before they turn brown, the dough
  will be softer and flakier. If you remove them after they have browned
  slightly, the dough will be crisper.
  
  Remove cookies from cookie sheet before they have cooled completely, or
  else they stick to the cookie sheet.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Rolled, walnut-filled cookies -- This recipe has been in the family for
  a while. These cookies make great Christmas gifts.
  
  *  During my childhood, these cookies tasted wonderful.  However, now they
  strike me as a bit sweet.  You could probably decrease the amount of brown
  sugar by 1/4 to 1/2 and make up for the loss in volume by increasing the
  amount of nuts.

      Title: Whistle Stop's Sugar Cream Pie
 Categories: Pies & past, Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Brown sugar (do not pack)
      6 tb All purpose flour
      1 c  Half and half
      1 c  Heavy whipping cream
        pn Salt
      1 ts Vanilla
           Butter
           Cinnamon
 
  Mix together brown sugar and flour and put in bottom of an unbaked deep
  dish pie shell. Then mix together Half and half, whipping cream, salt, and
  vanilla. Slowly pour this mixture over the top of the brown sugar mixture.
  DO NOT STIR!!!!!  Dot with slices of butter and sprinkle with cinnamon.
  Bake 10 minutes at 450 degrees. Reduce heat to 325 degrees and bake for 50
  minutes. Serve slices of pie slightly warm.
  
  **I have found that baking the pie in a glass pie dish has better results
  then using the pie shell already in a aluminum pan.  The aluminum ready pie
  crust seems to over cook the brown sugar and make it hard instead of a
  gelatin type substance.  Also Vanilla ice cream is a great accompaniment to
  the pie. Plus it will help ease some of the kick from the richness of the
  pie.
  
  This is the recipe for the locally famous and loved Sugar Cream Pie baked
  and served at The Whistle Stop restaurant in Glendale KY

      Title: Zwetschgendatschi
 Categories: Desserts, Bavarian, Usenet
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    1/4 lb Butter
    1/3 c  Sugar
    1/2 t  Vanilla (or use
           -vanilla sugar)
      1    Egg
      1 T  Sour cream
      1 pn Salt (only if you
           -use unsalted butter)
      1 t  Lemon peel
  1 3/4 c  Flour
      1 t  Baking powder
      2 c  Italian plums

-------------------------OPTIONAL STREUSEL TOPPING-------------------------
      6 T  Butter
    3/4 c  Flour
    1/3 c  Sugar
    1/2 t  Cinnamon
 
  In a large bowl, cream the butter, add the sugar (and vanilla), add the
  egg, (salt,) lemon peel and sour cream. Mix the flour and baking powder and
  add that.
  
  Pit the plums, splitting them into halves or thirds.  Grease the pan and
  spread the dough.  Liberally spread plums over the dough, meat side up. If
  the plums are sour (as opposed to just tart), sprinkle them lightly with
  sugar.
  
  To make the optional Streusel topping, cream the butter, add flour, sugar
  and cinnamon. Sprinkle over the plums. Bake for 30-45 minutes in the middle
  rack at 375 degrees F. Be careful not to let the bottom burn!
  
  Serve liberally topped with freshly-made whipping cream.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A Bavarian plum delicacy for dessert -- My mother and grandmother make
  this Bavarian specialty without a recipe; this recipe is from my mother,
  after I pressed her to write it down so I could make my own. It also
  includes variations from a few other folks that you might like to try.
  Roughly translated from Bavarian to German, this is Pflaumenkuchen, which,
  roughly translated from German to to English is Plum cake. However,
  Zwetschgen aren't ordinary plums, a Datschi isn't really a Kuchen, and a
  Kuchen is most definitely NOT a cake!
  
  This dessert is made of the slightly tart Italian plums, which are
  unfortunately only available at certain times of the year.  Don't try to
  make it with ordinary plums; they're too sweet and too juicy. Yield: Fills
  one round cake pan.
  
  *  A Datschi may actually be made with any fruit; I happen to love it with
  Zwetschgen the best.
  
  *  I don't know this with Streusel on top, and never prepare it that way,
  but several of my acquaintances swear by it. Made with other fruit, I would
  be more likely to accept the Streusel.
  
  *  If you like, you may sprinkle rum or cinnamon over the fruit before
  baking. Also, you might try substituting rum for the sour cream in the
  dough, or just adding both.
  
  *  If you want to make a cookie-sheet-sized Datschi, simply double the
  recipe.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 20 minutes baking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
