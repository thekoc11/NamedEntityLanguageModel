Barbara's Milk Chocolate Biscotti

cookies, italian

1 whole blanched almonds -- (7
1 ounces) skinned
7 ounce milk chocolate
1 (heatter uses
1 hershey's symphonybar)
1 3/4 cup sifted unbleached flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 (heatter uses
1 dutch-process cocoa)
1 cup granulated sugar
4 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Toast the almonds in a shallow pan in a preheated 350- degree oven
for 12 to 15 minutes, until lightly colored, shaking the pan once or
twice. You can tell when they are done by the strong smell of toasted
almonds when you open the oven door. Set asid e to cool.

Cut or break the chocolate into small pieces and place it in the bowl
of a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade. Let stand.

Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, cocoa and sugar. Add
about 1 cup of the flour mixture to the chocolate. Process for about
30 seconds, or until the chocolate is fine and powdery.

In a large bowl, mix together the processed ingredients with the
remaining sifted dry ingredients. Stir in the almonds.

In a small bowl, beat the eggs with the vanilla just to mix. With a
large rubber or wooden spatula stir the egg mixture into the dry
ingredients. You may think there is

Now place two 20-inch lengths of plastic wrap on the work surface.

To shape two loaves, spoon a strip of the dough down the middle of
each piece of plastic wrap. Each strip should be 13 to 14 inches
long. Flatten the tops. Lift the two long sidesof the plastic wrap
(hold them together as close as hands, press on the plastic wrap to
smooth the dough and shape it into an even strip 14 to 15 inches
long, 2 1/2 to 3 inches wide and 3/4 inch thick (no thicker), with
squared ends. If the strips of dough are teaspoon hicker than they should
be, the baked strips will not slice neatly.

Transfer to a cookie sheet and place in the freezer for about 2 hours
(or as much longer as you wish), until firm enough to retain the log
shape when the plastic wrap is removed.

To bake, adjust two racks to divide the oven into thirds. Preheat
oven to 300 degrees. Line two large cookie sheets with baking
parchment or aluminum foil, shiny-side up.

To transfer the frozen dough to the sheets (the dough may still be a
bit sticky; if so, it is okay ), open the two long sides of plastic
wrap on top of one strip of dough and turn the dough upside down on
the lined sheet, placing it diagonally on the sheet. Slowly peel off
the plastic wrap. Repeat with the second strip and the second sheet.

Bake the strips in the preheated oven for 1 hour, reversing the
sheets top to bottom and front to back once during baking to ensure
even baking. During baking the strips will spread out (7 to 8 inches
wide).

After 1 hour of baking, reduce the oven temperature to 275 degrees and
remove the sheets from the oven. Immediately, with a wide metal
spatula, release a strip from the parchment or foil and place it on a
board. Repeat with the second strip.

Use a pot holder or a folded towel to hold one of the hot strips in
place, and use a serrated French bread knife to cut the strip
crosswise into slices 1/2 to
3/4    inch wide.

Repeat with the second strip. Place the slices, standing upright, on
unlined cookie sheets with a little space between them.

Return to oven to bake at 275 degrees for 40 minutes, reversing the
sheets top to bottom and front to back once during baking.

Let cool and store in an airtight container.

After mixing and being shaped, the dough has to spend about 2 hours
in the freezer before it is baked (it can stay longer). There are two
bakings, which will total about 1 hour and 40 minutes.

1 cup sugar, granulated
1 large egg, beaten
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon mint extract
1/2 teaspoon mint extract
1/2 cup flour, unbleached
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder, double-acting
2 ounce chocolate, unsweetened
1  non-paralleils, multi-colored
2 teaspoon water

Beat butter until soft; gradually add sugar and blend until creamy.
Mix in beaten egg and extracts.  DON'T USE A FOOD PROCESSOR!!!

Stir salt and baking powder into flour; stir into butter/sugar
mixture.

Melt chocolate in water over a double-boiler; add to dough. Form into
a long roll approximately 2" - 3" wide. Wrap dough with plastic wrap
and chill overnight.

Slice dough 1/4" thick and place on greased cookie sheet. Sprinkle
with non-paralleils and press in slightly with back of spoon. Bake in
400 degree oven for 8 - 10 minutes. Cool cookies on rack.

Vicki's notes:

*  Can substitute 3 ounce. semi-sweet chips for the chocolate.

*  These cookies came about when my husband asked me to make
chocolate-mint cookies for Christmas.  (They are based on the
refrigerator cookies in "Joy of Cooking," with my own variations.)
Although disappointed because he really wanted Girl Scout cookies
(!), everybody else likes them and I've had several requests for the
recipe. (Actually, my husband usually asks for chocolate chip
cookies, no matter what time of year...)

Brownies

cookies, chocolate

8 ounce chocolate, unsweetened (8 squares)
1/2 pound butter
5  eggs
2 1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cup flour
2 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped (optional; )

Grease a 13x9 inch pan and pre-heat oven to 375 degrees F.  Melt the
chocolate and the butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering
water.  Whisk until smooth. Set aside to cool while beating eggs.

Beat the eggs, sugar and vanilla at high speed for a full 10 minutes. Blend
in the chocolate-and-butter mixture at low speed.  Add flour, beating just
to blend. Stir in walnuts, if desired.

Bake 30 to 35 minutes.  Do not overbake.  The brownies are done when a
toothpick inserted into the center comes out slightly dirty.  Cool in pan,
then cut into squares.

NOTES:

*  Serious chocolate brownies -- This is an adaptation of the "Scrumptious
Brownies" recipe found on a box of Baker's unsweetened chocolate. I've
reduced the amounts of sugar and flour from the original, which I find
makes for a very fudgey brownie. Yield: 32 brownies.

Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies

candy

2 cup butter
2 cup sugar (granulated, white)
2 cup brown sugar (dark brown)
4 large eggs
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 cup flour (sift before measuring)
5 cup rolled oats (oatmeal), powdered fin; ely
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoon baking powder
24 ounce chocolate chips
8 ounce chocolate bar,finely grated
3 cup chopped nuts

Note I prefer walnuts, but use your favorite

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Cream together the butter and the sugars.

Sift together flour, oatmeal, salt, baking soda, baking powder and shredded
chocolate bar.  Add eggs and vanilla to creamed sugar and butter, then mix
all ingredients together. Mix chocolate chips and nuts into mixture.

Drop by onto ungreased cookie sheet in small drops.  Bake 6 minutes or
until done.

NOTES:

*  Chocolate Chip Cookies like Mrs. Fields makes -- These cookies are a
combination of oatmeal and chocolate chip.  They are very rich, but very
tasty.  The recipe was obtained from a friend of a friend, who supposedly
paid a large amount of money for it. However, the cookies do not taste
exactly the same as the name brand. Yield: approximately 60.

*  A blender works very well to powder the oats and the chocolate bar. The
blender chops the oatmeal finer than a food processor.  The powdered
chocolate bar should melt at the touch of your fingers.

*  I prefer my cookies just barely done, so that they remain chewy. If you
want to send your taste buds into heaven, butter the cookies as they come
out of the oven (still hot), and eat them still warm with a glass of cold
milk.

*  Note that cocoa is not the same thing as a shredded chocolate bar. Note
also that oatmeal is not the same thing as quick-cooking oats or instant
oatmeal.  Oatmeal means "rolled oats," such as Quaker oats.

Chewy Chocolate-Orange Bars

cookies, chocolate

2 cup cake flour
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup quick-cooking oats
1 cup dark-brown sugar, packed
2  egg whites
1  raisin puree
3/4 cup chopped bitttersweet
1  chocolate
1/3 cup toasted walnuts, optional
1 tablespoon grated orange zest

Raisin Puree is the basis for the dough of this rich-tasting, chewy
bar. The combination of orange and chocolate is a classic favorite. We
considered cutting the amount of chocolate in the recipe, thereby
cut- ting the fat, but in the end we agreed that the extra richness
is worth the extra grams of fat. (By Times Food Stylists) Sift
together flour, baking powder and salt into large bowl. Stir in oats
and brown sugar. Beat egg whites lightly in another bowl. Stir in
Raisin Puree. Stir into flour mixture along with chocolate, walnuts,
and orange zest just until blended. Spoon in 9-inch-square baking pan
sprayed with non-stick vegetable spray. Bake at 350 degrees F. 25 to
30 minutes. Cool. Cut into 24 bars. 213 calories; 95 mg sodium; 0

into a pastry bag fitted with a small star tube. Pipe cream into
pastry or use a teaspoon to fill pastry with cream. Arrange
profiteroles in a pyramid-shape on a serving dish.

Chocolate & Peanut Butter Crescents

cookies, deserts, diabetic

2 cup sifted all purpose flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 pound (1 stick) butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1  egg

Sift together the flour, cocoa, and salt and set aside. In the large
bowl of an electric mixer cream the butter. Beat in the vanilla and
sugar. Add the egg and beat until thoroughly mixed. On low speed
gradually add the sifted dry ingredients, scraping the bowl with a
rubber spatula and beating until the mixture holds together. Transfer
the dough to a small bowl for ease in handling and set aside at room
temperature. Prepare the filling.

3/4 cup smooth (not chunky) peanut butter 1/2 cup strained or sifted
confectioners sugar.

In a small bowl thoroughly mix the peanut butter and the sugar.

Adjust rack to the center of the oven and preheat to
325    degrees.

To shape the cookies:  On a large piece of wax paper place the cookie
dough in mounds, using a slightly rounded teaspoon. (no more) of the dough
for each mound-in order not to make them too large it's best to
measure with a measuring spoon.  Do maybe a quarter of the dough at a
time.

Then do the same with the filling, using a level 1/2 measuring
teaspoon for each mound.  Place on other pieces of waxed paper.

Pick up one mound of the dough, roll it between your hands into a
ball, and flatten it between your palms until it is very thin. Then,
with a small metal spatula or a table knife, lift up and place one
mound of the filling in the center of the flattened dough. With your
fingers bring the dough around the filling and pinch the edges to
seal. Roll the filled dough between your hands into a cylindrical
shape about 2 inches long with very slightly tapered ends.  Place the
cookie on an unbuttered cookie sheet and as you do, turn the ends
down slightly to form a short fat crescent. Continue shaping the
cookies and placing them 1/2 to 1 inch apart-these do not spread.

Bake for 13 to 15 minutes, or until the cookies are firm to the touch.
Reverse the cookie sheet front to back once to insure even bakinZ of
sugar and roll the cookies in the sugar as they come out of oven.

surface like a cutting board. 5. Using heel of hand press dough into
mold. 6. Level dough with a knife or spatula, using a sawing motion.
7. To remove dough from mold, rap the mold against a protected
surface ( a cutting board covered with a towel works well). Hold mold
upright and rap the mold sharply against the board 2 to 3 times. As
the dough begins to fall out, catch with hand and lay on ungreased
cookie sheet. If dough does not come out, rotate mold and rap the

1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 pound butter
1/3 cup honey
1 large egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1  flour (1.1 c --> glass measuring cu; p filled to the top)
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Cream together the butter and the
brown sugar, add egg and vanilla. Mix well. Add honey.

Measure flour and baking soda (I usually just mix the soda in with the
flour.) Add flour and soda to batter a little at a time and mix. Add
chocolate chips.

Drop by spoonfuls onto an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 5-8
minutes at 375 degrees F.

NOTES:

*  Chocolate chip cookies with honey and brown sugar.

*  For those of you who like your cookies warm!  I always make up only
enough to eat, and store the batter in the fridge.

*  You can substitute margarine for the butter if you want.

: Difficulty:  easy, though creaming butter and sugar without a food
processor is tedious.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking and cooling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

Chocolate Chip Cookies - Hawley

cookies, chocolate

115 gm flour
2 ml salt
2 1/2 ml baking soda
100 gm butter, softened (1 stick)
60 gm white sugar
60 gm brown sugar
2 1/2 ml vanilla extract
1 large egg
175 gm nestle's chocolate chips (1
1  package)

1.  Preheat oven to 190 øC . Sift flour, salt, baking soda together
in a small bowl.

2.  In another bowl, mix butter with two sugars, vanilla and egg until
smooth. gradually mix dry stuff in with butter mixture. Mix in
chocolate chips.

3.  Put blobs of dough on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 190 øC for
8-10 minutes.

Author's Notes: There is no substitute for chocolate-chip cookies,
warm out of the oven, washed down with cold milk. This is Mom's
recipe, and Mom's Mom's recipe. This is also Nestle's ``TollHouse''
recipe, and the Joy of Cooking ``Chocolate-Chip Drop Cookies''
recipe, etc, which is no coincidence. This is the default recipe.
This is not Mrs. Field's recipe. If youwant Mrs. Field's, use a
shopping mall; if you want simple, elegant, timeless chocolate-chip
cookies, use this recipe.

Important: double all proportions above (always make 2x as much of
these as the recipe calls for). Let's face it: small is beautiful,
but big cookies are better than small ones. All the printed recipes
call for teeny cookies, dropped by teaspoonsful onto cookie sheets
(yield 50). My ``blobs of dough'' are golf-ball sized, which makes
healthy 3-4 inch cookies. I invariably make these on the spur of the
moment, and so usually nuke the butter in a microwave to soften it
up. I also occasionally cheat and soften up the butter/sugar mixture
a tad in the oven. Try adding walnuts, macadamias, white chocolate,
orange peel, butterscotch chips, or mint - all these are welcome
variations. But keep it simple.

Difficulty    : easy to moderate. Precision
: measure the ingredients.

Chocolate Chip Macadamia Crunch Cookies

cookies

1 cup butter flavored crisco
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
2  eggs
2 teaspoon vanilla
2 tablespoon buttermilk
1 1/2 cup flour
1/2 cup old-fashioned oatmeal, uncooked
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pkg milk chocolate chips (12 ounce)
1 cup macadamia nuts, chopped

Who else besides hillary Clinton uses vegetable shortening in
chocolate chip cookies? Thersa Monk and her 12-year-old daughter,
Krystal, of Germantown, MD., for two.

At least now. For years, the Monks used butter in their baking, but
when they saw an opportunity to compete in the Crisco American Baking
Celbration, they couldn't resist trying to concoct a recipe with
butter flavored Crisco.

The result: Chocolate Chip Macadamia Crunch Cookies, which won the
national $500 prize in the chocolate chip cookie contest in late
March.

*****

With an electric mixer, beat shortening, sugar, brown sugar, eggs,
vanilla and buttermilk for 3-5 minutes until very light and fluffy.
In a separate bowl, mix the flour, oatmeal, baking soda and salt. By
hand, add the shortening mixture and stir well. Add chocolate chips
and nuts and stir by hand.

Refrigerate for at least a half hour until the dough is firm. Drop
dough by the tablespoon, about 2" apart, onto a greased insulated
cookie sheet. Bake in a preheated 325'F. oven for 16-18 minutes until
the cookies are a light golden brown.

Cool cookies on baking sheet for a minute and then remove to cooling
rack.

RE: Chocolate Chip Cookies DATE: 04-26-91 AREA: COOKING

Just received a new publication:  THE COOKS BOOKSHELF catalog: "The
Finest Collections of American Cooking"
It is a catalog of "traditional" cookbooks,  many of the community
variety.   (p.o. box 9802-821, Austin, TX 78766). Has lots of neat
cookbooks.  The catalog published the following recipe from the
cookbook "Chockful O' Chips, A Collection of Chocolate Chip Recipes"
by Peggy Seeman.

With the spate of "Mrs. Fields"  and "Niemen Marcus" $250 chocolate
chip cookie recipes, I thought someone might want to try the
following. It does sound good. The author insists that you don't make
substitutions and gives brand names.  Makes it sound authentic,
doesn't it.

Preheat oven to 350.

DO NOT SUBSTITUTE INGREDIENTS (says the author)

Cream together with electric mixer until fluffy the sugars,
shortening, eggs, vanilla and milk.

Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt and
gradually add to creamed mixture.  Mix well with a spoon. Do not use
electric mixer.

Stir in chocolate chips, oatmeal and pecans.

Drop by teaspoonfuls on lightly greased cooking sheet. Bake for 12-15
minutes.  DO NOT OVERBAKE.  (The key to these cookies turning out
well is mixing the wet ingredients thoroughly until light and fluffy
and in not overbaking)

Chocolate Madeleines

cookies

2  eggs
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon grated lemon rind; or
2 teaspoon grated orange rind
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa
8 tablespoon butter; melted cooled slightly, p
4 tablespoon butter; softened

PREHEAT OVEN TO 400F. Smear 1/2 teaspoon softened butter over the
inside of each madeleine form. Be sure to completely cover with
butter--don't leave spots. Combine the eggs, sugar and lemon or
orange rind in a large mixing bowl, and stir them together. Set in a
pan of simmering water and stir until the egg mixture is very warm to
your finger. Remove from the heat and beat with a mixer at high speed
until fluffy, pale yellow, and tripled in volume, about 3 minutes.
Add the vanilla and salt. Dump the flour and cocoa into a sifter or
strainer. Sift once, return to sifter or strainer and sprinkle half
of it over the egg mixture, and fold it in. Pour in 8 tablespoons of
butter and sprinkle on the remaining flour, and fold gently just
until the batter is mixed. Spoon a generous tablespoon of batter into
each prepared mold; do not spread it evenly; it will level itself in
the oven. Bake for about 10 minutes, until the edges of the cakes are
golden and they lift easily from the molds. (If you have only 1 pan,
and can bake only 12 at a time, let the mold cool, wipe it out,
grease with butter, then refill with batter and bake again.) Remove
from the oven, slipping the tines of a table fork under each cookie
to free it, and transfer the madeleines to a rack to cool. Serve
within a few hours, or wrap airtight and freeze. Serve plain, or
sprinkle the ribbed side with confectioners' sugar.

Chocolate Malted Cookies

cookies

2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup butter flavored crisco
1 1/4 cup brown sugar, firmly packed
1/2 cup malted milk powder
2 tablespoon chocolate syrup
1 tablespoon vanilla extract (yes 1 tb)
1 large egg
1 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup milk chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 350-degrees. Get out 2 cookie sheets; no need to
grease them. Mix together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.

In a mixing bowl, combine the shortening, brown sugar, malted milk
powder, chocolate syrup and vanilla. Beat 2 minutes, then add the egg
and beat for a second or two, until mixed.

Gradually add the flour mixture to the creamed mixture, mixing well
between additions. Stir in chocolate morsels and chips. I j used
Guittard's BIG chocolate morsels and their milk chocolate chips. BTW,
these cookies are LOADED with chocolate chips!

Shape dough into 2-inch balls. Place 6 balls of dough onto each cookie
sheet, spacing them 3 inches apart. The cookies are pretty big, not
tiny ones.

Bake for 12-14 minutes, or until golden brown. Mine took 12 minutes.
Don't over-cook them or they'll be hard as a rock.

Cool on cookie sheets for at least 2 minutes or they'll fall apart.
Cool on wire racks.

1/4 teaspoon salt
1  egg
1  sugar
2 pkg andes mints; about 24 mints

ABOUT 4 HOURS BEFORE SERVING OR UP TO 1 WEEK AHEAD:

In a heavy small saucepan over low heat, heat semisweet chocolate
pieces until melted and smooth, stirring occasionally. In a large
bowl with mixer at low speed, beat melted chocolate, flour, butter or
margarine, corn syrup, baking soda, salt, egg, and 1/2 cup sugar

hands, shape dough into 96 balls; roll balls in sugar to coat. On
ungreased cookie sheets, place balls, about two inches apart.

Bake cookies 12 to 15 minutes until set.  Immediately remove half of
cookies from cookie sheets and invert onto work surface. While they
are still hot, place chocolate-covered mint patties on the cookies on
your work surface.  Then quickly top with remaining cookies, top-side

Chocolate Moist Madeleines

cookies, christmas

3 tablespoon (plus 1 1/2 teaspoons)
1  unsweetened cocoa
3 tablespoon boiling water
3  large eggs
1 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 1/4 cup sifted cake flour (sift into
1  cup and level off)
3/4 cup (plus 2 tablespoons) sugar
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
13 tablespoon unsalted butter (softened)
      ----SYRUP----
2 tablespoon sugar
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon kahlua

Preheat oven to 350F.

In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the cocoa and water until
smooth. Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature, then lightly
whisk in the eggs and vanilla extract.

In a large mixing bowl, combine the remaining dry ingredients and mix
on low speed for 30 seconds to blend. Add half the chocolate mixture
and the butter to the dry ingredients. Mix on low speed until the dry
ingredients are moistened.  On medium speed (high speed if using a
hand-held mixer), beat for 1 minute to aerate and develop the
structure. Scrape the sides of the bowl.  Gradually add the remaining
chocolate mixture in 2 batches, beating for 20 seconds after each
addition to incorporate the ingredients and strengthen the structure.
Scrape the sides of the bowl. Scrape the batter into a gallon
capacity freezer bag, close it securely, and cut off a small piece
from one of the corners of the bag. Pipe the batter into buttered
madeleine molds, filling them not quite full. Leave the remaining
batter in the bag, refrigerated, for the following batches.

Bake for 10-12 minutes or until a tester inserted in the center comes
out clean and the madeleines spring back when pressed lightly in the
centers. For even baking, rotate the molds from top to bottom and
front to back halfway through the baking time.

Unmold madeleines onto wire racks to cool completely.

If desired, these madeleines may be brushed with a Kahlua syrup made
as follows:

In a small pan, stir together the sugar and water. Bring to a full
rolling boil.  Cover immediately and remove the pan from the heat.
When cool, swirl in the Kahlua.

If desired, brush the madeleines on both sides with the syrup. Wrap
each one separately in plastic wrap. For the most attractive
appearance, store them without the syrup and brush on the syrup a day
or so before you plan to serve them.

Store in an airtight container at room temperature, or in the
refrigerator or freezer.

Keeps 3 days without syrup, 1 week with syrup, at room temperature; 2
weeks refrigerated; 3 months frozen.

Tips: If you do not have enough madeleine molds to bake all the
batter at one time, store the batter in the refrigerator and bake it
in batches. Rinse out the molds after each batch and butter them.

If you are planning to use the madeleines to dunk, omit the syrup;
madeleines should be a little dry so that they act like sponges. The
syrup helps to preserve the moistness and will greatly extend their
keeping qualities, which is helpful if you are planning to give them
as gifts.

The syrup allows the cookies to keep over 1 week at room temperature.
If you are planning the eat them the same day or the next, omit the
syrup or use only a sprinkle of Kahlua. The subtle coffee flavor
accentuates the chocolate.

2  squares unsweetened
1  chocolate -- melted
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon salt

Preheat oven at 350.  Prepare a cookie sheet with cooking spray. In a

scraping down side of bowl frequently with rubber spatula. Spoon
dough into cookie press fitted with template of desired shape. Press
cookies 2 " apart onto prepared cookie sheets. Bake 10 to 12 minutes,
or until firm. NOTES : When baking on metal , especially at high
temperatures, cookies have a tendency to brown on the bottoms before
centers are done. By stacking two baking sheets together you put an
extra layer of metal under them as well as a thin cushion of air. The
effect is to slow the heat and allow more even baking. Recipe By

Cream together the butter and sugar, beating very well. Sift together
the flour, cornflour and baking powder and beat into the butter and
sugar.

Spread the mixture in a 30 cm (12 in) long baking tin, about 4 to 5
cm ( 1 to 2 in) deep and smooth even. Bake in a preheated oven, 180
oC (350 oF) for 20 minutes (or until golden brown). Take the tin out
of the oven and set aside to cool for 10 minutes while you make the
caramel.

b) Caramel

Put all the ingredients for the caramel - except the vanilla - into a
saucepan. Over a moderate heat, stir until the butter has melted and
the sugar dissolved completely. Then bring the mixture to the boil
and boil for 5 to 7 minutes.

Take the pan off the heat, stir in the vanilla and continue stirring
for 2-3 minutes to cool it slightly. Then pour it over the shortbread.

Leave to cool completely.

To finish, melt the chocolate over hot water (no overheat !!) and
pour it over the caramel layer.

When it is cool, mark into squares with a sharp knife (makes 12 - 16).

Store in airtight container.

2 cup butter
2 1/2 cup sugar
3  eggs
2 teaspoon vanilla
5 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/4 cup unsweeted cocoa powder

Warning: this recipe is from the "Make a Mix" cookbook, so it makes
TONS. Directions are included for freezing.

In large bowl, cream butter, sugar, eggs and vanilla until light and
fluffy.

In medium. bowl, combine flour, baking soda and cocoa. Gradually stir
flour mixture into sugar mixture until evenly distributed. Divide
dough into four equal pieces and shape each piece, using dampened
hands so it doesn't stick, into a long roll, about 8-10 inches long.
Wrap each roll in one piece of waxed paper. Place wrapped rolls in
plastic freezer container with tight-fitting lid OR wrap air-tight in
large piece of heavy duty foil. Label; store in freezer and use
within 6 months.

To use one roll of dough (about 36 cookies): Preheat oven to 350
degrees. Lightly grease 2 large baking sheets. Cut frozen dough into
1/4-inch slices. Place slices on prepared baking sheets about 1/2
inch apart. Bake 8 to 10 mins., until cookies are set and slightly

Chocolate Walnut Cookies

cookies

4 large eggs
1 1/2 cup sugar
16 ounce semisweet chocolate, melted and coo; led
1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 tablespoon vanilla
1 tablespoon strong brewed espresso
1/2 cup cake flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon double-acting baking powder
2 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup walnuts, chopped

In the bowl of an electric mixer beat the eggs and the sugar for 4 to
6 minutes, or until the mixture is thick and pale, add melted
chocolate, the butter, the vanilla, the espresso, the flour, the salt
and the baking powder, and beat the mixture on the lowest setting
until it is combined well.  Add the chocolate chips and the walnuts
and beat the dough until it is combined well. In a sheet of parchment
paper, form the dough into a log, 4 inches in diameter, wrap it in
wax paper, and chill it for 3 hours, or until it is firm.

Cut the log into 1-inch-thick rounds, arrange the rounds 2 inches
apart on baking sheets lined with parchment paper, and bake them in
batches in the middle of a preheated 350F oven for 15 minutes, or
until the tops are shiny and cracked slightly.  (The cookies will be
very soft.) Transfer the baking sheets to racks and let the cookies
cool completely before removing them from the sheets. (The cookies
will firm up as they cool.) Makes about 12 cookies.

Chocolate-Chip Cookies

beverages, eggs, spreads

1 cup flour (plus 2 teaspoon)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup butter, softened (1 stick)
6 tablespoon sugar, white
6 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 large egg
6 ounce nestle's chocolate chips (1 package; )

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Sift flour, salt, baking soda together in a
small bowl.

In another bowl, mix butter with two sugars, vanilla and egg until smooth.
gradually mix dry stuff in with butter mixture.  Mix in chocolate chips.
Put blobs of dough on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F. for
8-10 minutes.

Important: double all proportions above (always make 2 x  as much of these
as the recipe calls for). Let's face it: small is beautiful, but big
cookies are better than small ones. All the printed recipes call for teeny
cookies, dropped by teaspoonsful onto cookie sheets (yield 50). My "blobs
of dough" are golf-ball sized, which makes healthy 3-4 inch cookies.

NOTES:

*  Cookies like what Mom should have made -- There is no substitute for
chocolate-chip cookies, warm out of the oven, washed down with cold milk.
This is Mom's recipe, and Mom's Mom's recipe.  This is also Nestle's "Toll
House" recipe, and the Joy of Cooking "Chocolate-Chip Drop Cookies" recipe,
etc, which is no coincidence. This is the default recipe. This is not Mrs.
Field's recipe. If you want Mrs. Field's, use a shopping mall; if you want
simple, elegant, timeless chocolate-chip cookies, use this recipe. Yield:
12 big cookies.

*  I invariably make these on the spur of the moment, and so usually nuke
the butter in a microwave to soften it up. I also occasionally cheat and
soften up the butter/sugar mixture a tad in the oven.

*  Try adding walnuts, macadamia, white chocolate, orange peel,
butterscotch chips, or mint, all these are welcome variations. But keep it
simple.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.

Chocolate-Dipped Biscotti

cookies, italian

1 cup sugar
1/2 cup butter, sweet; melted & cooled
2 tablespoon pernod
1 1/2 tablespoon bourbon
2 tablespoon anise seed
3 large egg
1 cup almonds; chopped
2 1/4 cup flour
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
12 ounce chocolate chips; semi-sweet
2 tablespoon shortening

In a large mixing bowl, stir together the sugar and melted butter.
Add the Pernod, bourbon and anise seed. Beat in the eggs, then stir
in the nuts. Sift the dry ingredients together. Gently stir in the
dry ingredients until well incorporated.  Cover with plastic wrap and
chill for about three hours.

Preheat the oven to 375 F.  Butter two cookie sheets. Shape the dough
on cookie sheets into three loaves, well spaced. Each loaf should be
about two inches wide and 1/2" thick. Bake for about 20 minutes,
until the loaves puff up and brown.

When the loaves are cool enough to touch, cut each loaf into diagonal
slices about 1/2" thick.  Lay the slices on their cut sides and toast
them at 375 F. for an additional 15 minutes or until lightly browned.
Cool.

Dip biscotti in chocolate the day they are to be served. In the top
of a double boiler, melt the chocolate chips with the shortening,
stirring frequently.  (If you're *really* ambitious, add a little
chocolate wax to get a good do on it.)  Remove from heat and stir
until a candy thermometer read 85 F. Holding each cookie by its
bottom, gently dip the tops into chocolate.  Turn immediately and
allow to dry, uncoated side down, on wax paper.  Repeat until all are
done.

Chocolate-Gilded Danish Sugar Cones

cookies

1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
2  egg whites
1 teaspoon vanilla
3 ounce bittersweet chocolate or
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 400'F. Generously grease 4 cookie sheets. Beat butter
and sugar in large bowl until light and fluffy. Blend in flour. In
clean, dry bowl, beat egg whites until frothy. Blend into butter
mixture with vanilla.

Using measuring teaspoon, place 4 mounds of dough, 4" apart, on each
prepared cookie sheet. Spread mounds with back of spoon dipped in
water to 3" diameter. Bake, 1 sheet at a time, 5-6 minutes or until
edges are just barely golden. (Do not overbake or cookies become
crisp too quickly and are difficult to shape.) Remove from oven and
quickly loosen each cookie from cookie sheet with thin spatula. Shape
each into a cone; cones become firm as they cool. (If cookies become
too firm to shape, return to oven for a few seconds to soften.)

Melt chocolate in small bowl over hot, not boiling, water. Stir until
smooth. When all cookies are baked and cooled, dip flared ends into
melted chocolate. Let stand until chocolate is set. If desired, serve
cones by standing them in a bowl. (Adding about 1" of sugar to bottom
of bowl may be necessary to hold them upright.)

Cookies~ Chocolate Chip~ Bureaucrat's~ Guide

cookies, chocolate, deserts

      ----TOTAL LEAD TIME: 35 MINUTES----
      ----INPUTS----
1 cup brown sugar, packed
1/2 cup sugar, granualated
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup shortening
2  eggs
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cup flour, all-purpose
1 teaspoon soda, baking
1/2 teaspoon salt
12 ounce chocolate pieces, semi-sweet
1 cup pecans, chopped

GUIDANCE:

1.) After procurement actions, decontainerize inputs. Perform
measurement tasks on a case-by-case basis.  In a mixing type bowl,
impact heavily on brown sugar, granulated sugar, softened butter and
shortening. Coordinate the interface of eggs and vanilla, avoiding an
overrun scenario to the bes of your skills and abilities.

2.) At this point in time, leverage flour, baking soda and salt into
a bowl and aggregate.  Equalize with prior mixture and develop
intense and continuous liaison among inputs until well-coordinated.
Associate key chocolate and nut subsystems and execute stirring
operations.

3.) Within this time frame, take action to prepare the heating
environment for throughput by manually setting the baking unit (by
hand) to a temperature of 375 degrees =F8F (190 degrees C). Drop
mixture in an ongoing fashion from a teaspoon type instrument in an
ongoing fashion onto an ungreased cookie sheet at intervals
sufficient enough apart to permit total and permanent separationof
throughputs to the maximum extent practicable under operating
conditions.

4.) Position cookie sheet in bake situation and surveil for 8 to 10
minutes or until cooking action terminates. Initiate coordination of
outputs within the cooling rack function. Containerize, wrap in red
tape and disseminate to authorized staff personnel on a timely and
expeditious basis.

OUTPUT: Six dozen official government chocolate chip cookie units.

Cream Cheese Chocolate Chip Pizza (Soft)

cookies, deserts

1 cup butter-margarine; softened
3/4 cup sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
8 ounce cream cheese; softened
1 teaspoon vanilla
2  eggs
2 1/4 cup all purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
12 ounce semisweet chocolate chips
1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

Preheat oven to 375. Lightly grease two 12 inch pizza pans. Cream
butter, sugars, cream cheese and vanilla in large bowl. Add eggs,
beat until light.

Combine flour, baking soda and salt in small bowl. Add to creamed
mixture; blend well.  Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts (if used)

Divide dough in half, spread each half evenly into prepared pans.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT SPREAD ALL THE WAY TO EDGES, THIS DOUGH DOES SPREAD
Leave about a half inch space between edge of dough and rim of pizza
pan.

Bake 20 to 30 minutes or until lightly browned.  Cool completely in
pans on wire racks.

To serve: cut into slim wedges.

Personal note:  When these were brown and ready to take out of the
oven they had a soft consistency - much like that of a soft batch
cookie. I wanted a firmer cookie. Put them both back in the oven, and
turned the off. Let sit for 1 hour hoping they then became more like
a chocolate chip cookie.  They never crisped up, but remained soft.
Still tasted good.

Esther Eskelson's Danish Raspberry Cookies

cookies, chocolate, christmas, scandinavia

2  1 ounce squares unsweetened chocola
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup sugar
1  egg
2 cup cake flour
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk chocolate or white
1  chocolate chips or a mixture
1 cup seedless raspberry preserves

Melt chocolate in top of a double boiler over hot not boiling water.
Remove from heat and cool. Cream butter and sugar in a large bowl
until light. Add egg and melted chocolate; beat until fluffy. Stir in
cake flour, vanilla and salt until well blended. Cover and
refrigerate until firm, about 1 hr.

Preheat oven to 400. Lightly grease cookie sheets or line with
parchment paper. Divide dough into 4 equal parts and divide each part
into two pieces. Roll each piece into a rope 12" long on a lightly
floured board. The ropes should be about the thickness of a finger.
Place 2" apart on the prepared cookie sheets. With your finger tip,
make an indentation along the length of each rope. Bake 8 min or
until firm.

Meanwhile melt the chocolate chips in a small bowl over hot water. If
you are using both kinds of chocolate, melt separately. Stir until
smooth. Stir preserves and spoon them into a pastry bag fitted with a
1/4" tip. [You can use a plastic bag with a corner snipped off with
scissors.]

When you remove the cookies from the oven, press preserves down the
indentation in each cookie strip. Return to the oven for 2 min and
remove to wire racks. While cookies are still warm, drizzle melted
chocolate over the tops and cut into 1" diagonal pieces. Refrigerate
until the chocolate has set.

This recipe was learned by my mate Roslind many Christmases ago from
her first husband's grandmother, Esther Eskelson and has been a
family favorite ever since.

1 cup butter -- softened
3/4 cup granulated sugar
3/4 can brown sugar, packed
2 teaspoon vanilla
2  extra large eggs
24 ounce chocolate chips -- (2
1  packages)

Preheat oven to 375F.  Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a
bowl, set aside. Cream together butter, granulated sugar, brown
sugar, and vanilla. Do not over beat mixture. Add eggs one at a time,
combining well after each addition.  Gradually stir in flour mixture.
Stir in chocolate chips, in 2 or 3 additions, mixing well. Drop by
rounded tablespoon onto ungreased cookie sheets.  Bake for
approximately 10 minutes, until lightly browned and centers have just
set - they should look almost a bit underdone. Let stand for 10 to 15
minutes to cool before moving to wire racks to finish cooling.

Cookies will be more moist than from standard recipes, and will pull
apart easily when very warm.

Blend all ingredients together until you can shape the dough into a
smooth ball. Let stand 20 minutes, loosely covered. Form dough into
marble-sized balls. Place 2 inches apart on greased cookie sheets.
Flatten each with a smooth bottom of a drinking glass greased once
and dipped into Nestle's Quik Powder. Bake at 400 for 8 minutes.
Remove at once from baking sheet, to paper toweling, and immediately
flatten each cookie with a smooth spatula. Let cool 20 minutes.

Cookie filling:

Soften gelatin in cold water. Place in heat-proof cup in pan of hot
water until gelatin is transparent. Meanwhile, beat Crisco until
fluffy, adding vanilla and sugar a little at a time. Beat in gelatin
mixture when it is completely cooled, but not set or firm. When
cooled, shape filling into 1-inch balls. Place between the two bottom
sides of the cooled cookies, and press gently until the filling has
spread to the edge.

recipe also said to drop by 1/3 C measures and THEN chill the dough.
I just didn't have room in the fridge  ;->  And the cookies are still
huge when I use the 1/4 Cup to spoon 'em out...

Hungarian Chocolate Cream Bars

cookies, chocolate, hungarian

      ----CAKE----
4 large eggs, separated
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
2/3 cup sugar, divided
3/4 cup sweet butter, room temp.
9 tablespoon cocoa powder
1/2 cup sifted all-purpose flour
      ----FILLING----
2 cup heavy cream
12 ounce semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 tablespoon powdered instant coffee
1/8 cup rum
      ----GLAZE----
5 ounce semi-sweet chocolate
1 ounce unsweetened chocolate
4 tablespoon sweet butter
1 teaspoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon karo syrup

Of all my recipes, this is the only one that I have never given
out-its raves convinced me in earlier years to keep it only as my
own. It is singularly the best chocolate dessert I have ever tasted!

Editor's Note: This recipe contains rum. If you prefer not to use
rum, the brownies still taste fantastic.

To make cake: preheat oven to 350ø. Grease 9 x 13-inch pan. Line pan
with wax paper and grease the wax paper.

Beat the egg whites lightly, add cream of tartar and beat at a high
speed. When shiny, gradually add 1/3 cup of sugar, continuing to beat
until stiff.

In a separate mixing bowl, place the egg yolks, remaining sugar and
butter and beat until light and fluffy. Add the cocoa and mix
thoroughly. Add a large dollop of egg whites to chocolate mixture and
whip until blended. Then pour the rest of the egg whites over the egg
mixture and sprinkle the flour over the egg whites. Fold gently with
a spatula until the egg whites and flour are incorporated.

Immediately spread the batter in the prepared pan. Smooth out to
edges and corners. Bake 10-15 minutes at 350ø until cake is done. Run
a knife around edges and invert cake on a wire rack to cool.

To make filling: in a saucepan, combine cream, chocolate chips and
instant coffee. Cook over low heat until mixture is smooth and
slightly thickened. Cover saucepan and refrigerate until very cold.
When chilled, add rum and whip in a chilled bowl at medium speed
until firm. Be careful not to over beat or the filling may separate.

To make glaze (do not make this until all other steps are
completed): in a small saucepan, melt all ingredients over a low
flame. Mix until very smooth. Cool for 15 minutes and mix again. Use
immediately, as the sauce thickens as it cools.

To assemble, cut cake horizontally into halves. Lightly sprinkle
bottom half with rum. Spread filling over bottom layer. Place top
layer on bottom half and spread filling over top. Refrigerate or
freeze until very firm. When very cold, set the cake on a wire rack.
Pour the warm glaze over the cake. Refrigerate again until firm. Cut
with a sharp knife, wiping the blade after each cut. You can freeze
cut squares.

1 cookie: 60 calories; 20 calories from fat; 2 gram fat; 0 mg
cholesterol

NOTES:

These cookies are great.  They are very sweet though. I've only used
an egg white when I've made these. Also, the dough is kind of
crumbly. I ended up kind of forming them with a spoon and my hands
into little balls. My experience was that they only took about 8
minutes to bake. I let them cool on the sheets for about 5 minutes
before easily moving them to cooling racks.  The dough makes them
look like they're not going to turn out, but I was pleasantly
surprised the first time I made them. You won't be able to tell that
they're low calorie and low fat. ENJOY! Let me know if you like them.

Martha Stewart's Fall Leaf Tuile Cookies

cookies, chocolate, holiday

      ----CHOCOLATE TUILE BATTER----
1/2 cup unsalted butter; room temperature
2/3 cup confectioner's sugar
4 large egg whites
1 cup all purpose flour
3 tablespoon dutch process cocoa powder
      ----WHITE TUILE BATTER----
1/2 cup unsalted butter; room temperature
2/3 cup confectioner's sugar
4 large egg whites
1 cup all purpose flour

Traditionally, tuiles are thin, crisp almond cookies that are gently
molded over a rolling pin or arched form while they are still warm.
Once set, their shape ressembles the curved French roofing tiles for
which they're named. Create an autumnal variation on the classic
French tuile cookie by shaping them with a leaf- shaped stencil. The
basic tuile dough of sugar, nuts, eggs, flour, and butter can be
enhanced by flavorings such as chocolate, vanilla, lemon or orange.
These delicate cookies are delicious served alone, or along side a
bowl of ice cream.

To make leaf-shaped tuiles, Martha Stewart cuts stencils shaped like
maple and oak leaves from the tops of plastic containers. She places
the stencils on a baking sheet lined with a nonstick baking mat. She
forms the cookies by spreading a thin layer of dough inside the open
part of the stencil. After removing the stencil form, she decorates
each leaf cookie by piping "veins" with a pastry bag filled with a
contrasting dough before baking. Work quickly when removing the
cookies from the oven because if you wait too long the cookies will
harden on the baking sheet and won't be flexible enough to curve over
the rolling pin. If this happens, you can return the baking sheet to
the oven for a few seconds, and try again. This recipe uses
Dutch-process cocoa, known for its rich flavor and color.

1. Sift flour with cocoa, and set aside.

2. In bowl of an electric standing mixer with paddle attachment, beat
butter and sugar on medium, until well combined, about 2 minutes.
Beat in egg whites, one at a time, beating for 4 minutes after each
addition. Add the flour-and-cocoa mixture, and mix until just
combined.

3. Reserve 1/2 cup batter; place in a pastry bag fitted with a #2 tip
and set aside for piping white tuile cookies.

Yield: 100 cookies

Martha Stewart's Favorite Cookie (Alexis' Brown Sugar Cho

cookies, chocolate

2 cup unsalted butter (4 sticks)
1 cup granulated sugar
3 cup brown sugar; firmly packed
4 each eggs, add one at a time
2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3 1/2 cup all purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup best quality chocolate chips

Alexis Stewart developed this chocolate-chip cookie recipe for her
mother, Martha, when she was twelve years old. Best enjoyed with a
cold glass of milk, these flat buttery cookies combine perfect
amounts of crunch and chewiness. Use an ice-cream scoop to make
evenly sized cookies. If cookies harden before you have a chance to
remove them from the baking sheet, return the sheet to the oven for a
few seconds to soften the dough for easier removal.

1. Heat oven to 375 B0. Cream butter until smooth; add sugars. Beat
in eggs and vanilla. Sift together dry ingredients, and slowly beat
into wet mixture. Fold in chocolate-chips.  Chill dough until firm,
at least
15    minutes.

2. Drop 2 to 3 tablespoons chilled batter per cookie onto a
well-greased baking sheets lined with baking mats or parchment; space
batter about 2 inches apart for spreading.  Bake 8 to 10 minutes,
until golden. Remove from baking sheets, and allow to cool on baking
racks.

Steve's Chocolate Chip Cookies

beverages, eggs, spreads

1/2 pound butter (2 sticks)
1 1/2 cup dark brown sugar
2  eggs
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 1/2 cup flour, all-purpose
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 pound chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.  Cream butter and sugar in a mixing bowl
until creamy. Spend some time and make sure it is well mixed. Add eggs and
vanilla and mix well. Add flour and soda, again mixing well. Add chocolate
chips. If it doesn't look like enough, then add some more.

Make big, thick cookies, big enough so that you get only 2 dozen of them
out of this recipe. Put them on a lightly-greased baking sheet. Put the
cookies in the oven, close the door quickly, and turn the heat down to 350
degrees F. Bake for 10 minutes.

NOTES:

*  Rich, thick, crunchy chocolate chip cookies.  Yield:  makes 2 dozen.

*  The use of real ingredients instead of imitation ingredients cannot be
overemphasized.  Chocolate-flavored chips, margarine, vanilla flavoring and
other such atrocities will completely destroy this recipe. I use Challenge
butter and Ghirardelli chocolate.

: Difficulty:  easy if you have a machine that can cream sugar and butter,
moderate otherwise.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking, 10 minutes cooling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

Super Chunky Cookies

cookies, chocolate, godiva

2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsalted butter -- softened
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 cup packed light brown sugar
2 large eggs -- room temperature
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup mini semisweet chocolate --
1  chips
1 cup milk chocolate chips
4 ounce bittersweet chocolate --
1  cut
1  inch chunks
2 ounce white chocolate -- coarsely
1/2 cup pecans; coarsely chopped
3/4 cup english toffe bits

Position one rack in the top and another in the bottom third of the
oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.

In a medium bowl, using a wire whisk, stir together the flour, baking
soda and salt until thoroughly blended.

In the 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using the
paddle attachment, beat the butter for 30 seconds at medium speed,
until creamy. Add the sugars and continue beating for 3 to 4 minutes,
until the mixture is light in texture and color. Scrape down the
sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the eggs one at a time,
beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla.

At low speed, beat in the flour mixture a third at a time, scraping
down the sides of the bowl after each addition. Using a wooden spoon,
stir in all the chocolate chips, the bittersweet chocolate and white
chocolate. Stir in the pecans and toffee bits. The dough will be very
stiff.

Drop the dough by slightly rounded tablespoonfuls onto 2 ungreased
baking sheets, leaving about 1 1/2 inches between the cookies.
Refrigerate the remaining dough. Bake the cookies for 11 to 13
minutes, or until the cookies are set and the edges are very lightly
browned; switch the positions of the baking sheets halfway through
the baking time for even browning.

Cool the cookies on the baking sheets on wire racks for 1 to 2
minutes. Using a metal spatula, transfer the cookies to wire racks to
cool completely. Repeat with the remaining dough. The cookies can be
stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days
or frozen for up to 1 month.

The $250.00 Neiman-Marcus Cookie Recipe

cookies, chocolate

2 cup butter
4 cup flour
2 teaspoon baking soda
2 cup granulated sugar
2 cup brown sugar
5 cup blended oatmeal (powder
1  oatmeal in blender after
1  measuring)
24 ounce chocolate chips
1 teaspoon salt
1 each 8 ounce hershey bar (grated)
4 each eggs
2 teaspoon baking powder
3 cup chopped nuts (your choice)
2 teaspoon vanilla

Cream the butter and both sugars.  Add eggs and vanila: mix together
with flour, oatmeal, salt, baking powder, and soda. Add chocolate
chips, Hershey Bar and nuts.  Roll into balls and place two inches
apart on a cookie sheet.  Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees.

The following is a TRUE STORY:

My daughter and I had just finished a salad at Neiman-Marcus Cafe in
Dallas and decided to have a small dessert. Because both of us are such
cookie lovers, we decided to try the "Neiman-Marcus Cookie". It was
so excellent that I asked if they would give me the recipe and the
waitress said with a small frown "I'm afraid not." "Well" I said,
"would you let me buy the recipe?"   With a cute smile, she said
"YES". I asked how much and she responded, " Only two fifty, it's a
great deal!" I said with approval, "just add it to my tab".

Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement from Neiman-Marcus
and it was $285.00.  I looked again and remembered I had only spent
$9.95 for two salads and about $20.00 for a scarf. As I glanced at
the bottom of the statement, it said,  "Cookie Recipe - $250.00".
That's outrageous!! I called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them
that the waitress said it was "two - fifty," which clearly does not
mean "two hundred and fifty dollars"  by any POSSIBLE interpretation
of the phrase. Neiman-Marus refused to budge. They would not refund
my money, because according to them,  " What the waitress told you is
not our problem. You have already seen the recipe - we absolutely
will not refund your money at this point." I explained to her the
criminal statutes which govern fraud in Texas, I threatened to refer
them to the Better Business Bureau and the State's Attorney General
for engaging in fraud. I was basically told, " Do what you want, we
don't give a crap, and we're not refunding your money." I waited a
moment, thinking of how I could get even, or even try to get any of
my money back. I just said "Okay, you folks got my $250, and now I'm
going to have $250.00 worth of fun." I told her that I was going to
see to it that every cookie lover in the United States with an e-mail
account has a $250.00 cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus... for free.
She replied, " I wish you wouldn't do this" I said, " Well you should
have thought of that before you ripped me off, and slammed down the
phone on her.

So, here it is !!!  Please, please,  please pass it on to everyone
you can possibly think of.  I paid $250 dollars for this... I don't
want Neiman-Marcus to ever get another penny off of this recipe...

      ----BROWNIES----
12 ounce semi-sweet chocolate*
12 ounce sweet butter
2 tablespoon brewed coffee
8 large (extra) eggs
1 teaspoon salt
4 cup sugar
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon almond extract
2 cup sifted all-purpose flour

      ----ICING----
12 ounce white chocolate
1 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup heavy cream

* (Tobler(R), Lindt(R), or Nestles(R))

The ultimate indulgence!

Use the middle rack of the oven. Preheat oven to 425ø. Butter bottom
and sides of two 13 x 9 x 2-inch aluminum pans, and dust lightly with
flour.

For brownies, melt chocolate, butter and coffee on top of a
double-boiler. Blend until smooth.

In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat eggs, salt, sugar and extracts
until light in color and creamy. Add melted chocolate to creamed
mixture, then mix in the flour and fold in walnut pieces.

Pour batter evenly into pans. Reduce oven to 375ø and bake for 30
minutes. Test for doneness with a toothpick (center will come out
clean and dry). Remove from oven and refrigerate immediately to cool.

To make icing: in the top of a double-boiler, add white chocolate,
chopped in pieces, sugar and cream. Heat until smooth; sugar should
be completely melted. Pour over cooled brownies. Sprinkle walnuts on
top. Return to refrigerator for chocolate to set.

Serve at room temperature, or freeze in trays, or serve individually

vanilla and egg--mix well. Slowly add dry ingredients to butter/sugar
mixture--mix well Add chocolate and nuts Spoon onto lightly greased
cookie sheets (I use cushionaire--no burning) Make whatever size you
what--I tend to make them large because it saves time Bake 8-12
minutes, depending on size of cookies--they should not brown, more of
a golden color Cool on rack

BTW:  I usually make a double batch of the dough, separate into
halves, and add regular chocolate chunks and pecans to one (and maybe
some coconut), white chocolate and macadamias to the other--two
cookies with half the work

World's Best Chocolate Chip Cookies

cookies, chocolate

3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup butter
1 tablespoon vanilla
2  eggs, slightly beaten
3 cup flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 cup chopped nuts (optional)

This recipe is said to have come from a famous cookie maker. So make,
bake, and compare to see if these cookies aren't "the real thing." One
feature that distinguishes these cookies from traditional chocolate
chip cookies is their perfect size. It comes from using a small size
ice cream scoop to drop them onto the cookie sheet.

Preheat oven to 350ø.

In a large bowl, combine sugars; add in butter and cream together
with the sugar. Add vanilla and eggs; mix together.

In a separate bowl sift the dry ingredients and add to the creamed
mixture. Mix well; the dough will be stiff. Add the chocolate chips
and nuts (if using).

Line the cookie sheets with baking parchment or wax paper. Drop
dough with a small ice cream scoop onto the sheets. Bake 10-12
minutes at 350ø. Remove from oven and cool on wire racks.

Variation: For ice cream sandwiches, turn one cookie face down,
place a scoop of ice cream on it and top with another cookie.
