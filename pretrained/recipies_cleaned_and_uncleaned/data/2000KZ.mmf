      Title: KUNG PAO CHICKEN II
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    3/4 lb Chicken breast, boned
           -and cut into shreds
           Cornstarch
      1    Egg white
      1    Garlic clove, minced
      1    Ginger piece, minced
  1 1/2 ts Red pepper, crushed
    1/2 c  Skinless peanuts
    1/2 c  Bamboo shoots, diced
    1/2 c  Pea pods
    1/2 c  Straw mushrooms
           Oil

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      2 tb Brown bean sauce
      1 tb Hoisin sauce
      1 ts Sugar
      2 ts Rice cooking wine
           -(or use dry sherry)
      2 tb Water
 
  Dust chicken breast with cornstarch and massage in egg
  white. Mix sauce ingredients.
  
  Heat oil in wok and stir-fry peanuts briefly.  Remove
  from pan. Stir-fry chicken about two minutes.  Remove
  from pan.
  
  Pour in red pepper, garlic and ginger.  Fry until
  peppers begin to change color.  Add pea pods,
  mushrooms, bamboo shoots, chicken and sauce. Stir and
  cook 1 minute. Add peanuts, toss and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Stir-fried chicken with vegetables -- This recipe
  is from a Szechuan cooking class taught by Susan
  Newberry, Minnetonka, Minnesota.
  
  *  The original recipe said the mushrooms and pea pods
  are optional but I found that they are a must.  The
  cornstarch and egg white act to seal the moisture so
  the chicken does not get dry. This gives the chicken a
  very different texture.  I feel this is the way to
  stir fry chicken. But make sure that you do not let
  the chicken and egg white stand for more than 5
  minutes, otherwise the egg white starts to run. Raw
  skinless peanuts are best, but you can also use
  blanched peanuts. The hoisin sauce and bean sauce are
  available at any oriental grocery store and at some
  supermarkets.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes preparation, 5 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

      2 tb Salad oil
      2    Stalks Celery, cut into 1/2
           -inch slices
      1 sm Green or red bell pepper,
           -cut into 1 inch squares or

      1 cn Sliced bamboo shoots (8
           -oz.), drained
  1 1/2 ts Cornstarch dissolved in 1
           -tablespoon of water
 
  Cut cleaned squid tubes lengthwise to open; lay flat
  on a cutting board. Holding a long sharp knife at a
  slight angle to the board, score the inside of the
  squid tube diagonally in one direction every 1/4 inch.
  Turn the squid 1/4 round and score again to produce a
  crosshatch pattern. Repeat with all squid. Be careful
  not to cut all the way through. Cutting along score
  lines, cut each squid tube crosswise into 3/4 inch
  wide strips. (The scoring will make each strip curl
  when cooked.)
  
  Combine marinade ingredients in a medium bowl. Add
  squid and stir to coat; set squid aside. In separate
  small bowls, combine chili seasoning and sauce
  ingredients; set aside.
  
  Place a wok or 10 to 12 inch frying pan over high
  heat. When hot, add 1 tablespoon of the oil and swirl
  to coat cooking surface. Add squid and stir until
  opaque, 3/4 to 2 minutes. Transfer squid to a bowl.
  
  Add remaining tablespoon of oil to wok. Add chili
  seasoning and stir until fragrant, about 10 seconds
  (press lightly on whole chilies to release their heat).
  
  Add celery, bell pepper, onion and bamboo shoots and
  stir for 2 minutes. Stir in sauce mixture, cover and
  cook 1 minute more. Return squid and their juices to
  the wok and add cornstarch mixture. Stir until sauce
  boils and thickens slightly. Serve over rice. Makes 4
  servings.

      1 c  Peanuts
      1 lb Chicken; breast, cut 1" pcs
           Marinade; chicken:
      2 ts Rice wine ;or dry sherry
      1 ts Cornstarch
      1 ts Sesame oil
  1 1/2 tb Dark soy sauce
      2 tb Red wine vinegar

      2 ts Ginger; fresh minced
      2 c  Garlic; minced
      1    Bell pepper; seeded, cut in
 
  ROAST THE PEANUTS IN A 325F oven until golden brown
  (about 10 minutes). Re- move and set aside. To make
  marinade, mix together rice wine, cornstarch and 1
  teaspoon Asian sesame oil. In a bowl, toss the chicken
  with the marinade; set aside until ready to cook. In a
  small bowl, mix well soy sauce, vinegar, sugar and
  other teaspoon of sesame oil. Over medium heat,
  preheat wok until hot. Add oil, salt and dried red
  chiles; cook until chiles are charred (about 15
  seconds). Add ginger and garlic; stir-fry until
  fragrant and lightly browned (about 30 seconds).
  Increase to high heat, add bell peppers and stir-fry
  for 30 seconds. Add the chicken into the wok and
  stir-fry a minute or until the cubes feel firm to the
  touch and are opaque white in color. It should take no
  more than a total of 2 minutes. Now stir in sauce
  mixture; toss and stir until it thickens into a glaze
  (about 30 seconds). Remove wok from heat. Add reserved
  roasted peanuts, fold together. Serve hot. Selden,
  here is my version of General Tso Chicken, which is
  also known as Kung Pao Chicken. When charring the
  chile peppers, be sure the ventilation is on and avoid
  breathing the strong chile fumes. The charring creates
  a desirable smoky flavor. Serves 4 to 6 with other
  dishes. GUEST CHEF (EXPT46B)

  15-30 minutes, cover.
    Mix pork, green onion, ginger, waterchestnut, salt,
  sesame oil, soy sauce, wine and cornstarch.
    Place dough onto foured board and knead until
  smooth. Divide dough into 40-50 pieces.  Flatten each
  piece with hand and roll into 2-3" round thin
  pancakes. Put 1 to 2 teaspoons of filling in center
  then fold over to make a half moon and pinch edges
  together.
    Heat a flat pan until hot, add 2 tablespoons oil.
    Put enough dumplings to cover the bottom of pan
  without overlapping. Fry 2 minutes or until bottom is
  golden. Add 2/3 cup cold water, cover and cook until
  water has evaporated. Add 1 Tablespoon oil to side of
  pan and fry another minute and serve immediately. (I
  use a 12 inch cast iron skillet for this and use more
  than the 2 tablespoons oil mentioned above; I also use
  more than the 1 T oil at the end. Swirl the oil around
  the pan when you add it at the end...this helps
  removal of the pot stickers!)
    For a dipping sauce, I use soy sauce, sesame oil,
  chopped ginger, and chopped scallions.
    My friends have told me that they have not had
  better dumplings than these in any restaurant. Try
  this and let me know what you think! Posted on Genie

      4    Fresh hot green chillies
      2 tb White poppy seeds
           Quarter tsp salt
      3    Medium-sized tomatoes,
           Roughly chopped
      1 tb Natural (plain) yoghurt
      1 ts Garam masala
      2 tb Chopped, fresh green
           Coriander
 
  Place the aubergine, carrots, peas, French beans and
  potato in a medium-sized saucepan. Add 8fl oz (250ml)
  water. Bring to the boil. Cover, turn the heat to
  medium and cook for four minutes or until the
  vegetables are just tender.
  
  Meanwhile put the coconut, chillies, poppy seeds and
  salt in an electric blender. Add 5 fluid ounces (150
  ml) water and grind to a fine paste. Set aside.
  
  When the vegetables are cooked, add the spice paste
  and 5 fluid ounces (150 ml) water. Stir and simmer
  gently for five minutes. Add the tomatoes, yoghurt and
  garam masala. Stir gently to mix well. Bring to the
  boil and simmer gently for 2 - 3 minutes. Turn into a

  TIPS
  
  If you wish to substitute unsweetened, desiccated
  coconut for fresh coconut use 5 tbsps (1 oz/30
  grammes). Barely cover with warm water and leave for
  one hour, then proceed with the recipe.
  
  Coriander is the parsley of India. Mix it with
  vegetables and chicken, use as a garnish and add the
  stems to soup and dals for extra flavour. To keep
  coriander fresh, stand sprigs in a glass of water,
  cover with a plastic bag and keep in the fridge.
  
  Kurma
  
  Westerners who come to Madras, Tamil Nadu's capital
  city, expecting to find meals made with "Madras" curry
  powder are in for a surprise. Curry powders
  manufactured in this southern Indian city are strictly
  for export. Aromatic spices, fennel seeds and fresh
  coconut are the ingredients that give the superb
  cuisine of Tamil Nadu its flavour and texture.
  
  For this dish, vegetables are "dressed" with a ground
  paste of fresh coconut, poppy seeds and green
  chillies, which is cooked briefly with the vegetables
  so that it is absorbed by them. The dish is best
  served with plain rice and you could also serve it as
  an accompaniment to a meat dish.

      Title: KURT'S TACO/BURRITO MEAT
 Categories: Tex-mex, Meats, Tested, Mine
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 ea Chorizo link; sliced 1/4"
           -(Mexican sausage) *
    1/2 md Red onion; diced
    1/4 c  Bell pepper; diced
      1 ea Celery stalk; diced
      2 ea Garlic cloves; fine chopped
  1 1/2 lb Extra lean ground beef =OR=
  1 1/2 lb Ground turkey
      2 tb To 3 masa harina
  1 1/2 tb Worcestershire sauce
      2 tb Canned green chiles; diced
      1 ts Mexican oregano; crushed
    1/2 ts Dried rosemary; crushed
    1/2 ts Dried thyme; crushed
      3 tb Chili powder; or to taste
      1 tb Paprika; or to taste
      2 ts Cumin; or to taste
        x  Salt & pepper to taste
        x  Tabasco or other hot sauce
           -to taste
 
  Place sliced chorizo in cold heavy skillet; turn on
  flame to lowest setting. The idea is to render the fat
  from the chorizo before cooking it.
  
  Meanwhile, prepare the onion, bell pepper, celery and
  garlic.
  
  After the chorizo has sizzled and released it's fat
  (about 10 minutes) use a spatula to break it into
  small bits.  Turn up the heat and add the onion,
  celery, and green pepper; saute for 8 minutes. Add the
  garlic and saute for another 2 minutes.
  
  Drain fat from the mixture by placing on a paper towel
  on top of a brown paper bag or newspaper.
  
  In the same skillet, brown the ground beef or turkey.
  Crumble the meat. (A potato masher works great.)
  
  When browned, drain off most of the fat.  (Tilt the
  skillet and use a baister to suck it out.)  Stir the
  masa in to absorb the remaining juices.
  
  Add the chorizo mix, green chiles, W. sauce and
  remaining spices. Let it cook on the lowest heat for
  another 30 minutes, stirring every
       10    minutes to prevent stickage.
  
  NOTES: * If you cannot find chorizo, a workable
  substitute is:
      1/2 lb Ground pork
    1 1/2 ts White vinegar
        1 ts Paprika
        1 tb Chili powder
      1/2 ts Oregano
        1 ea Garlic clove; minced
      1/2 ts salt
        1 ds cayenne
  
  Mix ingredients and let the flavors blend in fridge
  for a day.
  
  ~ All measurements are approximate; I cook by feel. ~
  The vegies saute'd with the chorizo =really= makes a
  difference. ~ Ground turkey -vs- beef: either works
  great, as long as it's lean. ~ Use flour instead of
  masa harina if not available. ~ The end result should
  =not= be greasy/drippy! ~ Substitute fresh Anaheim or
  California chiles for the canned
    chiles. If doing so (recommended), saute' along with
  other veggies
    in the chorizo.

  Blanch the wheat with boiling water.  Cover and let
  stand for about 1 hour.  Pour off the water, then add
  enough cold water to cover about double, and cook,
  covered, over low heat until the kernels are soft,
  about 3 to 4 hours depending on the type of wheat.
  Strain and allow to cool. Blanch the poppy seeds with
  boiling water, allow to rest for 15 minutes, then
  drain.  Add enough cold water to cover and reheat to
  boiling.  Cook for a few minutes then drain the water
  again.  Pour the seeds into a cotton towel and pat and
  squeeze dry.  Then mash the seeds in a processor or
  blender until mixture turns from slate to milky.
  Combine the wheat, poppy seeds, and honey.  Taste and
  season as needed with salt.  Add the chopped walnuts
  and raisins.  The consistency should be semiliquid.

  NOTES:
  
  *  Delicious and nourishing bars for hiking or home --
  This is a recipe that my daughter, Kylie, has
  perfected, starting from one published in some
  magazine.  They are ideal to use as trail bars, being
  both filling and full of energy, but are also perfect
  as snacks at home or work. When on a hard bushwalk,
  eating these is a real highlight of my day.
  
  *  The bars are best kept in the refrigerator,
  although it's by no means essential.  They soften in
  the heat but don't disintegrate.
  
  *  Any other cereal crumbs can be combined with
  cornflakes to make up the 3 cups.  It's a good way to
  use up those otherwise annoying scraps.  If too much
  powdery stuff goes in, the bars can be somewhat dense.
  Using Rice Bubbles (Rice Krispies) gives a lighter
  texture.
  
  *  Desiccated coconut is best, as shredded coconut is
  too course.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes.

      1 kg Quinces
      4 c  Water
           Granulated sugar
      2 ts Lemon juice
      2    Rose geranium leaves
 
  Cooking time: 2 hours
  
  Wash quinces well to remove the fuzz.  Peel and core.
  Slice quinces into preserving pan and add 2 cups
  water.  Leave aside and do not be concerned if quince
  discolours.
  
  Place peels and cores into a pan with remaining water
  and boil for 30 minutes.  Strain and make liquid up to
  2 cups with water.  Add liquid from peels to sliced
  quinces in pan.  Bring to the boil and simmer gently
  for 1 hour until quince flesh is very tender.
  
  Scald a large piece of cheese cloth or doubled butter
  muslin, wring out and drape over a deep bowl.  Pour
  quince and liquid into clean cloth and gather up ends.
  Tie with string and suspend over bowl.  Secure to a
  fixed object so that juice can drip slowly into bowl.
  Leave for 24 hours.  Do not squeeze bag to hasten
  dripping as this will make jelly cloudy. Measure juice
  into clean preserving pan.  For each cup of juice add
  1 cup sugar. Stir over heat till sugar dissolves, add
  lemon juice and washed geranium leaves and bring to
  the boil.
  
  Boil rapidly for 25 minutes, skimming frequently.
  Test a teaspoonful on a cold saucer.  Leave to cool.
  Run finger across jelly in saucer - setting point is
  reached when surface wrinkles.  It is advisable to
  remove pan from heat while jelly is being tested as
  you would overcook the jelly. Remove leaves and ladle
  hot jelly into hot sterilized jars.  Seal when cold.

      Title: KYTHONI XYSTO (GRATED QUINCE PRESERVE)
 Categories: Greek, Condiments, Jams
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      4    Quinces (about 1 kg)
      3 c  Water
      4 c  Sugar
      2    Thin lemon rind strips
      1    Piece cinnamon bark *Or*
      2    Rose geranium leaves
    1/4 c  Blanched split almonds *
      2 tb Lemon juice
 
  *Note: almonds should be toasted.
  
  Cooking time: 1 1/2 hours
  
  Wash quinces well and rub off all fuzz.  Peel, quarter
  and remove core. Place peels and cores in a pan with 2
  cups water and boil for 20 minutes. Grate quince
  quarters and place in a heavy preserving pan with
  remaining water.  Leave aside until peels are boiled.
  Do not be concerned if quince discolours.
  
  Strain liquid from peels into a measuring jug and make
  up to 2 cups with water.  Add this to grated quince
  with the sugar, lemon rind and cinnamon bark or washed
  geranium leaves.  Place over medium heat and stir
  occasionally with a wooden spoon until sugar is
  dissolved.  Bring to the boil and boil fairly rapidly
  for 1 hour or until it gels when tested on a cold
  saucer.
  
  Stir in almonds and lemon juice and boil 1 minute
  longer.  Ladle into hot, sterilized jars and seal when
  cold.
  
  Note:  As the peel and core contain pectin, the
  setting ingredients for jellies and preserves, it is
  advisable that these be boiled to extract the pectin.

      Title: KYTHONOPASTO (QUINCE PASTE)
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
           Pulp from Kythoni Peltes
           Granulated sugar
           Water
           Bay leaves
           Caster sugar
 
  Cooking time: 45-50 minutes.
  
  Puree quince pulp by pressing through a sieve or
  process in food processor. Measure puree into a heavy
  pan.  Add 1 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water to each cup of
  pulp.  Set over medium heat and stir occasionally
  until sugar is dissolved.
  
  Bring to the boil, then boil steadily for 40-45
  minutes, stirring occasionally so that paste cooks
  evenly.  As paste is thick, it has a tendency to
  scorch, so watch carefully.
  
  When cooked, paste comes away from sides of pan and is
  dark red in colour. Spread while hot into an oiled
  slab cake pan so that it is 2 cm (3/4 inch) thick.
  Leave in pan at room temperature for 2-3 days, lightly
  covered with muslin.
  
  When dry and firm, cut into small diamond shapes with
  an oiled knife. Lift out and place in a container with
  bay leaves between layers.  Seal tightly.
  
  When serving, dip tops lightly into caster sugar to
  give pieces a fine coating.  Kythonopasto keeps
  indefinitely stored at room temperature and is
  traditionally served in place of a spoon sweet,
  accompanied with a glass of iced water.

 Categories: Digest, Jan.
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     11 oz Whole-grain macaroni or
           Rigatoni
     11 oz Potatoes in small dice
      2 lg Onions, cut in thin circles

      5 oz Grated cheese
           Salt, pepper
 
  1. Cook the macaroni and potatoes in a little salted water until just

      Title: L'ESTOUFFAT DE NOEL (BORDEAUX CHRISTMAS BEEF STEW)
 Categories: Stews, French
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 lb Top round
      6    Carrot
      2    Leek
      2 lg Onion
      2    Shallot
      6    Garlic clove
      1    Celery rib; sliced
     12 sl Bacon
      1    Bay leaf, Turkish
      5    Parsley sprig
  1 1/2 ts Peppercorns
  1 1/2 T  Thyme, dried
      1 ts Salt
      2    Cloves, whole
  1 1/4 l  Bordeaux red; decent
    1/3 c  Wine vinegar, red
    1/4 c  Cognac
 
  Cut beef into 8 oz chunks.  This is important; smaller chunks will
  fall apart during the long cooking.  Cut carrots in 1" chunks.  Use
  only the white of the leek; halve each and wash well, then cut into
  1" chunks. Slice onions thinly.  Chop shallots; peel and mash garlic
  cloves. Slice celery thinly.  Cut bacon rashers (slab bacon only,
  please) in 1" slices. DO NOT use California bay leaf in this recipe;
  the California bay leaf has a very strong, harsh taste which will
  ruin the entire dish. Look for an imported (Turkish) bay leaf.  For
  the wine, use something considerably better than Gallo jug; the
  instructor used a couple of $10 French Bordeaux.
  
  Combine all ingredients in a heavy casserole (8 to 10 quarts);
  marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours.  Slowly bring the
  casserole to a simmer while you make a luting (sealing) paste of
  flour and water. When ready, put a thick strip of dough around the
  lid where it meets the pot and clamp on well; then take the remaining
  luting paste and seal well around the outside.  The pot should be
  completely sealed; no steam (or only the occasional wisp) should
  escape.  Simmer the stew at 100 F to 150 F for 8 to 10 hours in the
  oven; the lower temperature and longer cooking is more desirable.
  Break open the crust and serve over potato purée.

      Yield: 10 Servings
 
 
  3 lbs of stewing beef 3 cans of red kidney beans (14oz) 2 can of brown
  beans (14 oz) 1 can of Hunts tomato paste (large) 1 cup of ketchup 2
  large green peppers 2 large red peppers 2 teaspoons black pepper
    salt to taste 1/2 cup of chili powder 1 cup of mashed potatoes
  (cooked) 1/4 mashed banana 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 large can
  tomatoes (quart) prefer home canned 1 tablespoon crushed chillis (to
  suit more or less) 1 tablespoon black mollases 1 teaspoon Cumin 1
  teaspoon Oregano 2 large Spanish onions (you have'ta shed tears when
  slicing these) 3 cans of mushrooms (8 oz.cans)
  
  Cutbef nt 1 inch chunks or thereabouts. etbef soak in a bowl with the
  tomatoes and juice, lemon juice, mushrooms, blak pepper, crushed
  chilis and onions over night. Brown the meat in a skillet. In large
  pot throw in the tomatoes and crushed chillis, onions, meat, paste,
  everything except the beans and peppers and slow cook for three
  hours. Next chop your green and red peppers into long slivers or if
  you prefer diced. Also stir in your beans and cook slowly for one
  more hour. With the thick "soupy" ring around the pot; stir back into
  the simmering chili.
  
  You might like the chili hotter or maybe milder, depends on your
  taste. What ever you do, don't ruin the chili by making it hotter
  with hot sauces, this has a tendency to make the chili into
  "superficial" body heat not a deep solid heat. To accompany the chili
  try and get your hands on some "Agua Dente" (fire water) 80% alcohol
  (national drink in Colombia). I guarantee you will see God!

      Title: LA GALETTE PEROUGIENNE  (SUGAR PIE)
 Categories: Pies, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
      1 pk Active dry yeast
    1/3 c  Lukewarm water
  2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
      2 tb Sugar
           Grated zest of 1/2 lemon
    3/4 ts Salt
      6 tb Chilled unsalted butter
      1    Whole egg
      1    Egg yolk

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
      5 tb Frozen unsalted butter
    1/4 c  Sugar
 
  1. Combine the yeast and a pinch of sugar with the lukewarm water and
  stir until the yeast dissolves. Let stand for about 5 minutes, or
  until foamy. If the yeast doesn't foam, begin again with fresh
  ingredients. 2. Place the flour, sugar, zest and salt in a food
  processor. Process, turning the motor on and off several times, to
  mix well. Remove the processor top and slice the butter by 1/2
  tablespoonfuls, into the container. Turn the machine on and off
  serveral times, until the bits of butter are no longer discernible.
  3.  Lightly beat together the egg and egg yolk. With the motor
  running, add the yeast mixture to the processor and immediately add
  the egg. Process for 45 seconds to knead the dough. 4. Form the dough
  into a ball and set it in a lightly floured bowl. Sprinke the top of
  the ball lightly with flour. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let
  stand at room temperature for about 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in
  bulk. 5. Preheat the overn to 425 degrees. Adjust the oven racks to
  both the lowest and highest positions in the oven.  Place the dough
  on a lightly floured surface and flatten evenly with your hand. With
  a rolling pin, gradually press out the dough into a 19-inch circle.
  Fold the dough in quarters, center the point in a 17-inch pizza pan,
  and unfold the dough to cover the pan. Fold a 1/2-inch rim of dough
  inward to make a neat border, and make a decorative edge. 6. Make the
  topping:  With a swivel-bladed peeler or sharp knife, shave the
  frozen butter evenly over the dough, right out to, but not on, the
  border. Sprinkle with the sugar. 7. Set the galette on the lower oven
  rack and bake for about 6 minutes, or until the border is lightly
  browned and the surface bubbles.  Increase the heat to 475 degrees
  and move the pan to the higher oven rack.  Bake for about 4 minutes,
  or until the top surface is browned in parts. 8.  Slice into wedges
  and serve. The galette should be eaten while hot and soft.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2    Ripe avocados -- halved,
           Pitted
      3    Serrano chiles with seeds --
           Finely minced
    1/8 ts Kosher salt
 
  Everybody knows how to make guacamole, right? Wrong. Please, no lime
  or lemon, no sour cream. This recipe makes what is probably the most
  commonly made guacamole in Mexico. It is very rich and buttery, and
  is so simple to make, it can be done at the last minute. We make
  guacamole to order at Cafe Marimba, adding a little cilantro and
  roasted tomato, and we serve it right in the molcajete in which it is
  made.
  
  Quickly mash the avocados and chiles together and season with salt.
  Guacamole should be chunky. Taste for seasoning and serve immediately.
  
  Makes about 1 cup.

 Categories: Mexican, Salsas, Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3    Roma (plum) tomatoes
      3    Habanero chiles
    1/4 c  Water
    1/8 ts Kosher salt
 
  Salsas in the Yucatan are usually quite simple, while recados tend to
  make the dishes they season complex. Perhaps that is why simplicity
  is seen as a virtue when it comes to salsas. But I think there is
  another reason: the habanero chile, reputedly the hottest pepper in
  the world. In addition to the heat, habaneros have a citrusy aroma
  and flavor that are best savored on their own. This salsa is the
  classical accompaniment to meats and seafood cooked in achiote. Try
  it on Grilled Squid Yucatan Style. There are variations with onion,
  orange juice, and mint, but this simple version is my favorite.
  
  Pan roast tomatoes until blistered, deeply browned, and soft. Pan
  roast chiles until dark brown, then remove seed cores.
  
  Put all the ingredients in a blender and blend smooth. Use within
  several hours.

      Title: LA PARILLA GREEN CHILE SALSA
 Categories: Mexican, Salsas, Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Clove garlic
      1    Thick slice white onion
      1    Roma (plum) tomato
      1    Tomatillo
      3    Poblano chiles
    1/2 c  Water
      1 tb Fresh cilantro -- roughly
           Chopped
    1/8 ts Kosher salt
    1/4 ts Cumin -- toasted and ground
 
  Green chiles -- poblanos, Anaheims, and New Mexico long greens --
  always make me think of Santa Fe. There, they make salsa with the
  local chiles and bottle it for sale around the world. This fresh
  version has more complex seasonings than the Santa Fe product, and is
  one of the truly great salsas for dipping and slathering all over
  everything.
  
  Pan roast garlic until brown and soft, then peel.  Pan roast onion
  until brown and soft, then roughly chop. Pan roast tomato until
  blistered, deeply browned, and soft. Pan roast tomatillo until
  blistered, browned, and soft. Pan roast poblano chiles until dark
  brown, then remove seed cores.
  
  Place the garlic, onion, tomato, tomatillo, and chiles in a food
  processor and pulse briefly until finely chopped. Add the water,
  cilantro, salt and cumin and process again until blended. Keeps,
  tightly covered, about 3 days in the refrigerator.
  
  Makes about 1 1/4 cups.

    1/4 c  Corn oil
      6    Arbol chiles -- with seeds
      8    Tomatillos -- husked
      1 sm Clove garlic -- minced
      1 tb Fresh cilantro -- coarsely
           Chopped
    1/2 c  Water
    1/3 c  White onion -- finely diced
    1/8 ts Kosher salt
    1/8 ts Mexican oregano -- toasted
           And ground
    1/8 ts Cumin -- toasted
 
  In northern Mexico and south Texas, this brick-red salsa is slathered
  over all kinds of meats and cheeses. In fact, this style of salsa
  became so popular that variations (like Tabasco sauce) are bottled
  for sale worldwide. Try this version for its complex and cleansing
  heat.
  
  Heat the corn oil in a medium-sized skillet over medium-high heat
  until hot but not smoking. Fry the chiles, 1 or 2 at a time, until
  puffed and brown, about 10 seconds. Do not burn or they will taste
  bitter. Shake off excess oil from chiles and place in a food
  processor.
  
  Put the tomatillos in a small saucepan, cover with water, and place
  over high heat. Bring to a boil, lower heat to a simmer, and cook
  until tender, about 10 minutes. The tomatillos will have changed
  color and be soft but still whole.
  
  Add the tomatillos to the food processor along with the garlic.
  Process until finely chopped. Add the cilantro and water and continue
  to process until smooth. Add the onion, salt, oregano, and cumin and
  pulse to mix. Keeps, tightly covered, about 3 days in the
  refrigerator.

      1    Jalapeno chile with seeds --

      3 tb Fresh cilantro -- coarsely
           Chopped
      1    Ripe avocado -- peeled and
           Pitted
    1/4 ts Kosher salt
      1 c  Water
      3 tb White onions -- diced
 
  This is the version of guacamole you often see in little taquerias in
  Mexico. The spicy, thin mixture has a great smooth flavor. But the
  reason you see it used so often is that it is much less expensive
  than the famous chunky guacamole, an advantage in tiny restaurants
  where tacos commonly cost less than the equivalent of thirty cents.
  It is so good, however, that I use it even when the difference in
  cost is no object.
  
  Put all the ingredients except the onion in a food processor and blend
  until very smooth. Pour into a bowl and stir in the onion. Use
  immediately.
  
  Makes about 2 cups.

    1/4 c  Corn oil
     12    Arbol chiles -- with seeds
      2    Roma (plum) tomatoes
      6 md Cloves garlic
    3/4 c  Water
    1/4 ts Mexican oregano -- toasted
    1/4 ts Kosher salt
    1/4 ts Cumin -- toasted and ground
 
  This is typical of what you would find on tables in northern Mexico,
  where salsas tend to be a little brutal -- hot and very direct with
  uncomplicated flavors. I love this kind of salsa on quesadillas and
  broiled meats. A great all-purpose condiment, a spoonful or two will
  enliven almost any dish. Be careful, though. People in the north like
  their food hot.
  
  Pan roast tomatoes until blistered, deeply browned, and soft. Pan
  roast garlic until brown and soft, then peel.
  
  Heat the corn oil in a medium-sized skillet until hot but not
  smoking. Fry the chiles, 1 or 2 at a time, until puffed and brown,
  about 10 seconds. Do not burn or they will taste bitter. Shake off
  excess oil from chiles and place in a blender. Add 2 tablespoons
  chile cooking oil, tomatoes, garlic, and water. Blend until smooth.
  Add the oregano, salt, and cumin and blend again. Keeps, tightly
  covered, about 3 days in the refrigerator.

  This is one of Louisville's most celebrated chocolate desserts.
  Chocolate velvet earned its reputation at the Four Seasons restaurant
  in New York City, under the hands of pastry chef Albert Kumin, who
  later became the White House pastry chef.  Fritschner writes: "It's
  based on the bombe concept - lining a container with cake, filling it
  with creamy filling (in this case  mousse) and finishing the
  turned-out dessert with a glossy chocolate glaze."
  
  When Kathy and Will Cary opened La Peche gourmet carry-out in 1979,
  she added her adaptation of Kumin's recipe to the deli's offerings.
  Chocolate velvet has never left the dessert case since then, as it's
  so popular. As many as 50 chocolate velvets are sold there a week,
  made by pastry chef Scott Bieber.
  
  Line a 2 1/2 qt. souffle dish with plastic wrap.  Cut the pound cake
  into thin slices.  Line the bottom and sides of the souffle dish with
  overlapping pieces of pound cake, so there are no openings. Put 2
  layers of pound cake on the bottom, to prevent leaks.  Sprinkle 2 tb.
  of the amaretto around the pound cake.  Set aside.
  
  To prepare mousse:  In a bowl, combine 1/3 c. amaretto, the rum,
  chopped candy bars, melted butter, egg yolks and coffee. Stir well.
  
  In a double boiler, melt 1 1/2 lbs. of chocolate. Remove from heat and
  allow it to cool a little.  Whip the cream until stiff; set aside.
  With clean beaters, whip the egg whites with a pinch of salt until
  stiff. Slowly add 1 tb. powdered sugar and beat 1 minute. Slowly add
  the chocolate to the liquor mixture, stirring well to combine evenly.
  Fold in the whipped cream and egg whites.  Pour into prepared souffle
  dish.
  
  Use the rest of the pound cake to cover the top of the mousse,
  overlapping pieces.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least
  10 hours.
  
  To make the icing: Melt 1/2 lb. of chocolate.  Use an electric mixer
  to beat in the powdered sugar.  Add the coffee as needed to make a
  smooth icing.  (It resembles a buttercream. It is very smooth and
  thick enough to spread.)  Let the icing cool a bit before spreading
  on the cake.
  
  To ice the cake: Invert the chocolate velvet on a serving plate.
  Remove plastic wrap.  Spread with icing. Refrigerate. To serve, cut
  like cake. Serve with creme fraiche or whipped cream, if desired.
  
  Make chocolate leaves by running a spatula under a thin layer of
  tempered chocolate before it is set. Garnish velvet.
  
  Keeps well up to 10 days refrigerated and freezes beautifully for up
  to six months.

  you don't have any leftovers ready to use for this recipe. You may
  also be able to find roast pork in the deli section of your market.
  The sandwich is dressed with a sauce for which only La Teresita's
  owner knows the recipe. All he gave us to go on is that it's called
  mojo, which is a combination of olive oil with any citrus juice, any
  herb and any member of the lily family--garlic, onion or shallots,
  for example. Here's what we came up with.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Ground beef
    1/4 c  Lime juice
      2 tb Fish sauce (nam pla)     **
    1/2 ts Galangal powder(kha pon) **
      6    Shallots, thinly sliced
      2 tb Scallion (spring onion),
           - chopped
      2 tb Cilantro leaves, chopped
      2 tb Ground roasted sticky rice**
      1 ts Thai red chili pepper,
           - ground (prik khee no pon)
     15    Mint leaves
 
  Description:
    The blend of fresh herbs and lime juice makes this salad very
  refreshing. This laab recipe was taken to Bangkok by the people of
  the Northeast and is one of the favorite dishes of Thailand. Other
  meats such as chicken or pork can also be used.
  
  Directions:
    Combine the ground beef with the lime juice, fish sauce, galangal
  powder and shallots.
    Heat a skillet and cook the ground beef mixture on medium-high heat
  for 5 minutes or until the beef is cooked.
    Remove the skillet from the heat and add the chopped green onion and
  cilantro and the ground roasted rice. Mix thoroughly so that
  everything is well combined.
    Remove to a serving plate, spoon the ground pepper on the side of
  the plate if desired, and garnish with the mint leaves.
    Serve with an accompaniment of raw vegetables, such as long string
  beans or snake beans, sliced cabbage, green leaf lettuce/Chinese
  lettuce, basil leaves, and swamp cabbage or spinach.
  
    ** TERMS
    Roasted sticky rice: Prepared by adding raw sticky rice to a hot
  skillet and cooking until it is golden brown. Add a tablespoon of
  water to the pan at occasional intervals. Grind in a mortar with a
  pestle if ground roasted sticky rice is needed.
    Galangal (kha): A relative of the ginger root, galangal is pale
  yellow and has a unique, delicate flavor. Fresh young ginger root,
  but not dried ginger, is an adequate substitute, but does not
  properly replace the unique flavor.
    Fish sauce (nam pla): A salty, pale brown liquid used widely in Thai
  cooking, this is made from fermented small fish or shrimp. The fish
  are salted and fermented in jars and then the liquid is collected. It
  adds salt to many dishes and is essential for authentic Thai
  flavors--and is available from Asian food stores.

  Stir in the peas & simmer, covered, until the vegetables are all
  cooked right through.  Remove from heat & blend in the garam masala.
  Sprinkle with cilantro & serve.

      1    Stick cinnamon
      4    Cardamom (elaichi), crushed
      4    Cloves (lavang), powdered

MMMMM---------------------MASALA INGREDIENTS--------------------------
      1 ts Turmeric powder
      1 ts Coriander powder
      2 ts Garam masala powder
      2 ts Mild cayenne pepper powder
      2    Green chili peppers
      3    Cloves garlic
      1 sm Piece  ginger
      1 tb Vegetable oil
           Salt

MMMMM---------------------OPTIONAL "TOUCHES--------------------------
           Blanched, slivered almonds
           -and/or cashews.
 
  1.  Toss cauliflower and peas in one of the inner bowls of the
  pressure cooker.  Wash with water and drain. Sprinkle with some salt.
  Steam this in the pressure cooker. (you can cook rice in the other
  bowl of the pressure cooker simultaneously).
  
  2.  Meanwhile, chop the tomatoes;  dice the onions.
  
  3.  Grind into paste:  half the onions, together with the other
  ingredients for the masala.
  
  4.  Heat a little oil, add cinnamon, cloves, and remaining onions. Fry
  until onions are turning golden. (if you're going for the pretentious
  touch, you can add the almonds/cashews now.)
  
  5.  Add the masala paste and mix/fry well, stirring continuously.
  
  6.  Beat the yogurt with the tomatoes.  Stir into the frying pan.
  
  7.  Turn off the heat and cover, (but keep stirring frequently). Wait
  for the pressure cooker to release pressure gradually until it is
  safe to open.
  
  8.  Add cauliflower and peas to the frying pan, turn the heat back on
  and add a cup of water with salt according to taste. Cook until gravy
  thickens.
  
  9 The ideal appearance is a chunks of cauliflower in thick saffron
  coloured gravy (color comes from the turmeric).
  
  9. Garnish with your choice of freshly chopped cilantro, mint and any
  other unidentifiable :-) herbs shredded green chili peppers, finely
  chopped green and red bell peppers, NOTES: 1. This is a simple
  preparation, though slightly more complicated than the sag-aloo
  (spicy spinach & potatoes) that I posted a few days ago.
  
  2.  Total time required is about 45 minutes.  But I find it feels
  like less since it does not demand undivided attention.
  
  3.  Quite inexpensive, even with the almonds and cashews and the fancy
  geegaws.
  
  ** IMPORTANT **
  
  4.  About the cayenne pepper...  I find that because of the cooling
  effect of the yogurt, 2 spoons of _MILD_ cayenne pepper works for me.
  However, it depends on whether you want your mouth watering and your
  eyes lighting up, or the other way 'round.  :-)

      Title: LACTO: LOWFAT TIRAMISU
 Categories: None, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 c  Nonfat cottage cheese
      1 c  Nonfat sour cream
           -alternative
      2 tb Dark rum
      8 oz Carton vanilla lowfat yogurt
      8 oz Package Neufchatel cheese
  1 1/4 c  Hot water *
      1 tb Instant espresso
           -coffee granules
    1/2 ts Instant espresso
           -coffee granules
     40    Ladyfingers
    1/2 ts Unsweetened cocoa
 
  I served the low-fat Tiramisu for Easter dinner yesterday. Everyone
  seemd to love it.  We had all had Tiramisu in restaurants and agreed
  that the low-fat version didn't taste as heavy. But I think it's a
  good substitute if you need low-fat (which I do). Here it is again -
  it's from the October, 1993 issue of _Cooking Light_. NOTE: There
  were only 4 of us at dinner, so I made only half the recipe, put it
  into a deep covered casserole (about 8x8"), and refrigerated it with
  the cover on. It was a lot easier than doing the thing with the
  toothpicks.
  
  * Instead of the instant espresso, I just made an equivalent amount of
  espresso and let it cool some.
  
  Place first 6 ingredients in food processor with knife blade and
  process until smooth; set aside.
  
  Combine hot water and espresso granules in a small bowl. Split
  ladyfingers in half lengthwise.  Quickly dip 20 of the halves, cut
  side down, in espresso and place, dipped side down, in the bottom of
  a 9-inch square baking dish.  Dip 20 more ladyfinger halves, cut side
  down, into espresso, and arrange dipped side down, on top of the
  first layer. Spread 2 C of the cheese mix- ture evenly over the
  ladyfingers. Repeat procedure with remain- ing ladyfinger halves,
  espresso, and cheese mixture.
  
  Place toothpicks in each corner and 1 in the center of tiramisu to
  prevent plastic wrap from sticking to cheese mixture. Cover with
  plastic wrap and refrigerate for 3 to 8 hours.  Sprinkle with cocoa
  before serving.
  
  This recipe makes 9 servings with 7.5 g fat each.  I hate to think
  how many grams of fat are in the real stuff!

      Title: LACTO: NAAN
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 9 Servings
 
  3 3/4 c  Unbleached,all-purpose flour
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
  1 3/4 c  Plain yogurt
           Soft unsalted butter
 
  Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a bowl. Slowly add as
  much yogurt as you need to gather the flour together and make a soft,
  resilient dough. Knead for about 10 minutes and form a ball [the
  dough, not you. -S ] Put the ball in a bowl and cover the bowl with a
  damp dishcloth. Set aside in a warm place for 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Knead
  the dough again and divide into nine equal parts. Keep them covered.
  Heat a cast-ironed skillet or griddle over a lowish flame. Preheat
  the broiler. Take one of the parts of dough and make a ball out of
  it. Flatten it and then roll it out on a lightly floured surface
  until you have a round that is about 1/8 inch thick. When the skillet
  is very hot, pick up the naan and slap it onto the heated surface.
  Let it cook slowly for about 4 to 5 minutes. It will either puff up
  completely or partially. Now put the whole skillet under the broiler
  for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes or until the puffing-up process completes
  itself and there are a few reddish spots on the naan. Remove the naan
  with a spatula and brush with butter if you like. Make all of the
  naans this way, keeping them stacked and covered with a clean
  dishcloth. Serve hot. If you wish to have the naans later, wrap them
  in a plastic bag when they have cooled. Before you eat, wrap as many
  as you need in aluminum foil and heat in a 400 degree oven for 15
  minutes.

      Title: LACTO: TIG'S STUFFED MUSHROOMS
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Large mushrooms with nice
           -caps
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      1 md Onion, minced
      2 tb Butter
    1/2 ts Basil
      1 ts Prepared mustard
           Salt and pepper to taste
      2 tb White flour
      1 tb Plain yogurt (or, sour
           -cream would work)
           -fresh bread about 6 slices
           -chopped into little pieces
    1/2 c  Shredded Mozarella cheese
           Olive oil
 
  Wash mushrooms and separate the stems from the caps. Set the caps
  aside to dry out, while you dice the stems into very small pieces.
  Set the stem pieces aside, and toss the mushroom caps in a little
  olive oil.
  
  Melt the butter in a medium saucepan and toss in the garlic and onion.
  Saute for a few moments, then add the basil, mustard, salt, pepper and
  mushroom stem pieces. When the veggies are soft, add the flour and
  stir for two minutes. Then remove the pan from the heat and stir in
  the sour cream. Allow to cool a bit, then add about 2/3 of the
  mozarella plus enough bread pieces to make the mixture stick together.
  
  Fill mushroom caps with the mixture and place on a cookie sheet. When
  all the caps are filled, top with the remaining mozarella and bake at
  350 degrees until the cheese starts to bubble (about 10 to 15
  minutes).
  
  Enjoy!

      Title: LACTO: ZUCCINI IN MOCK CREAM SAUCE
 Categories: None, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6 sm Zuccini
      2    Cloves Garlic, finely minced
      1 tb Butter
      1 tb Flour
           Salt, Pepper
           Grated Asiago or Romano
           -cheese (optional)
 
  Grate the zuccini into a calendar (sp), and sprinkle with salt. Place
  the calendar over a pan, to collect the zuccini juices, and let sit
  for 30-60 minutes. After this period, squeeze the zuccini over the
  calendar, reserving all juices that drip out.
  
  Heat some butter, olive oil, or peanut oil in a frying pan, and saute
  the zuccini and garlic for 2-3 minutes. While this is occuring, take
  the zuccini juices, and heat to near the boiling point (this step is
  critical, if the juices are not hot, this will not work).
  
  Make a well in the center of the zuccini, and heat the butter/crisco
  for a few seconds, then add the flour to the well, and stir the flour
  and butter/crisco together. After 1 more minute, add the hot zuccini
  juices, and stir for 30 seconds - you will get a thick sauce.
  
  Mix everything together now, and add pepper, and the optional cheese,
  if desired.
  
  This recipe is actually quick and easy, and absolutely delicious. I
  love rich french cooking, and this tastes like the zuccini is in a
  rich cream sauce, without a drop of cream (or butter, if I use crisco)
  
  This recipe comes from Greg Pongracz.

 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 110 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Walnut pieces
    3/4 c  Unsalted butter; softened
  1 1/2 c  Light brown sugar, packed
      1 lg Egg
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Quick-cooking rolled oats
    1/4 c  Wheat germ
      2 tb Cake flour
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F and adjust the rack to the middle level. Using
  the food processor, chop the walnuts by turning the machine on and
  off about 10 times; reserve them. Process the butter and sugar for 1
  minute, or until the mixture is creamed and fluffy. Add the egg,
  vanilla, cinnamon and salt and process the mixture for 1 minute,
  stopping the machine once to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add
  the rolled oats, wheat germ, flour and reserved nuts and combine the
  batter by turning the machine on and off a couple of times, or until
  the flour just disappears. Do not over-process it. Scrape down the
  sides of the bowl once during processing. Batter will be very thin.
  Drop the batter by the scant teaspoonful well apart on well greased
  aluminum baking sheets that have been sprinkled with water. Do not
  use Teflon-coated sheets. Place about 12 cookies on each
  17-by-14-inch sheet. (These cookies spread while baking.) Bake for
  6-to-8 minutes, or until they are browned. Let them rest on the
  baking sheets for 2 minutes, then transfer them carefully and quickly
  to wire racks with a metal spatula. If they cool before they are
  removed from the baking sheet, return the sheet to the oven for 1
  minute. Let the cookies cool completely before storing them in an
  airtight container. ---

 Categories: Pancakes, Jewish, Breakfast
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      4    Potatoes - peeled
      1 sm Onion
      2    Eggs
    1/3 c  Flour
      1 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Salt
      1 pn Lemon pepper
 
  or pepper oil - for frying
  
  Grate potatoes either using the largest holes on a four-sided hand
  grater, or the grater attachment on a food processor. Place potatoes
  in a colander and rinse under cold water to remove the starch. Be
  sure to allow potatoes to drain well.  Grate onion, removing any
  excess moisture by placing in colander and pressing with the back of
  a wooden spoon. Combine potato and onion.  Beat eggs into mixture;
  stir in flour, baking powder, salt and pepper.  If using a food
  processor, combine ingredients using plastic knife attachment so
  potatoes remain in grated pieces. Heat 1/8" of oil in a large
  skillet.  For each pancake, drop about 2 tablespoons of batter into
  the oil and flatten with the back of a wooden spoon; the flatter the
  pancake, the crisper it will be. Brown well on both sides. Drain well
  on paper towels. Keep the cooked pancakes warm in a 100 F oven. Serve
  with Pink Cinnamon Applesauce (see recipe) and/or sour cream. Makes
  about 2 dozen regular size or 5 dozen miniatures. Pancakes may be
  made ahead of time and refrigerated between layers of waxed paper
  when cooled. To reheat, place in a single layer on an ungreased
  cookie sheet. Bake uncovered at 450 F for 5 minutes, or until crisp
  and hot.

 Categories: Meats, Greek
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      1    Rabbit or hare
           -- cleaned and skinned
      2    Celery stalks, with leaves,
           -- chopped
      2 md Onions; chopped
      1    Carrot; sliced
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      1    Bay leaf; crumbled
      2    Sprigs fresh rosemary
      6    Peppercorns; bruised
      2 c  Dry red wine
    1/2 c  Vinegar
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
      4    Fresh tomatoes; chopped -OR-
      8 oz -Tomato sauce
      3    Allspice berries
 
  After washing the rabbit or hare thoroughly and cutting into serving
  pieces, place in a large glass or earthenware bowl. Make a marinade by
  combining the celery, onions, carrots, herbs, peppercorns, wine, and
  vinegar and pouring over the meat.  Cover and refrigerate for a day
  or two, turning the pieces over occasionally.
  
  On serving day, drain, reserving the marinade, and wipe dry. Transfer
  the marinade to a casserole and simmer for 15 minutes. While the
  marinade is cooking, heat the butter in a large frying pan, and when
  very hot sear the meat over high heat until it is reddened in color
  without browning. Remove from the heat, and with a spatula lift the
  rabbit or hare pieces into the simmering marinade, then pour in the
  remaining butter. Taste for seasoning, then add the salt and pepper,
  tomatoes, and allspice. Weight the meat with a small plate to keep it
  under the sauce, then bake it in a very slow oven (225 F) for 2-1/2
  hours, or until the meat is tender and the sauce thickened.

           Karen Mintzias
      1    Rabbit or hare
           -- cut into serving pieces,
           -- and marinated 1 or 2 days
           -See: Lagos/Kounelli Fournou
    1/4 c  Butter
      2 lb Small white onions
           -equal weight of rabbit/hare
      1 c  Canned tomato sauce
      3    Whole cloves
      2    Garlic cloves
      1 tb Raisins (optional)
      1    Bay leaf
      1 ts Granulated sugar
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
      2 tb Wine vinegar
           Fresh rosemary
 
  Remove the rabbit or hare from the marinade and wipe dry. In a large
  casserole, heat the butter or oil and sear the rabbit or hare over
  high heat until reddened in color, without browning the fat.
  Meanwhile, peel the onions and cut a cross in the root end with a
  sharp pointed knife to keep them from falling apart during cooking.
  Arrange around the rabbit or hare, then stir in the remaining
  ingredients, add enough water to cover, place an inverted plate over
  the meat and bring to a boil. Transfer to a very slow oven (225 F)
  and bake for 2 to 2-1/2 hours, until the rabbit or hare and onions
  are tender.  Remove from the oven and carefully pour off the sauce
  into a small saucepan. Boil down to 1-1/2 cups. Remove plate from
  casserole, pour the sauce over, and garnish with additional rosemary.
  Serve warm.

      Title: LAKELAND APPLE CAKE
 Categories: Lakeland
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      5 oz Butter or Margarine
      7 oz Granulated Sugar
      2 md Eggs
      1 ts Almond essence
      2 md Cooking apples, peeled
      8 oz Self-Raising Flour
      2 oz Baked Almonds
 
  Line a 7 inch spring clip cake tin with baking parchment.
  
  Soften your butter or margarine and then cream thoroughly with the
  sugar. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating in each one thoroughly.
  Beat in the almond essence.
  
  Make sure your oven is up to heat at 300F/Gas Mark 3/150C before you
  begin to compile the cake. Gently fold the flour into your creamed
  mixture the spread half in the base of the lined tin, slice in the
  peeled apples, levelling the surface as best as possible. Carefully
  spread over the remaining half of the cake mixture; the apples tend
  to skid about and make this task difficult - a hot knife will help!
  Sprinkle over the flaked almonds and put into the oven straight away.
  Bake for 90 minutes, cover if your cake is browning too much. It is
  very tempting to take it out too soon as the sponge will look cooked,
  but the apples make it a very moist mix and it needs this long
  cooking time. Allow to cool for 1 hour and then tuck in ~ it is truly
  at its best when eaten soon after baking!

      1 md Onion, finely chopped
      2 tb Chopped fresh mint
      1 ts Ground cayenne pepper
      1 ts Ground cloves
      1 ts Ground allspice
      1 ts Ground ginger
      1 ts Ground cardamom
    1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon

           Lettuce
           Cooked rice (optional)
 
  Keftas, from North Africa, are meatballs prepared with ground lamb or
  beef and a number of herbs and spices. They appear in a variety of
  dishes, such as stews, and also as brochettes hot off the charcoal
  grill. The seasonings range from chili to cinnamon and usually
  include a Moroccan favorite, fresh mint. These keftas are delicious
  served with pita bread, low-fat yogurt, tomatoes and lettuce or with
  cooked rice. Note: If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 20
  minutes.
  
  Combine all ingredients, cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or up to 24
  hours. Shape into 30 1 1/2-inch meatballs and thread them on six
  skewers. (You may slightly flatten them to make sausage shapes or
  leave them as balls.)
  
  Prepare a gas grill or charcoal fire. Grill for 3 minutes on each
  side, or just until no longer pink inside. Alternatively, broil the
  meatballs for 2 minutes on each side.

      Title: LAMB & PEAR TAGINE
 Categories: Lamb, Moroccan
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lg Onions, peeled & sliced
      1 kg Lean lamb, leg or shoulder
           -cut into 4cm cubes.
      4    Pears, peeled cored & cut
           -into 4cm chunks
    1/2 c  Sultanas
    1/2 c  Silvered almonds
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 ts Cumin
      1 ts Ground coriander
      1 ts Ground ginger
      1 ts Cinnamon
      1 ts Black pepper
           Water, to cover the meat
           Salt, to tast
 
  Intro. Tagines are Moroccan slow-cooked meat, fruit & vegitable dishes
  which are almost invariablely made with mutton. Using lamb cuts down
  the cooking time, but if you can find good hogget (older than lamb,
  younger than mutton, commonly labelled "baking legs" and sold
  cheaply) that will do very well.
  
  1. In a large saucepan gently fry the onion in the olive oil until
  soft, add the meat to the pan and cook until it changes color, then
  add the spices. Add water to just cover the meat and salt to taste.
  Cover and simmer gently until the meat is tender, about 1 1/2 - 2
  hours. (Displace the lid a little after an hour if there appears to
  be too much liquid.)
  
  2. Add the pears to the meat together with the sultanas & almonds.
  Cook for a further 5 minutes or until the pears are soft. Serve with
  rice.

      Title: LAMB CACCIATORE
 Categories: Meats, Soups
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 lb Lamb shoulder or leg;
           -trim fat and cut
           -into bite-size cubes
    1/3 c  Olive oil
      1 sm Garlic clove, minced
      1 ts Rosemary, dried, crushed
    1/2 ts Sage leaves, dried
      2 ts Flour
    1/2 c  Vinegar (white or wine)
    1/2 c  Water
           Salt and pepper,
           -to taste
 
  In a large, heavy-bottomed casserole dish brown the meat in hot olive
  oil.
   Be careful not to burn the olive oil: it has a lower burning
  temperature than other kinds of cooking oil.
  
  Add garlic, rosemary and sage.  Stir.  Sprinkle flour on meat and
  stir. Continue cooking the meat while stirring, to brown the flour a
  bit. Add vinegar and water. Stir thoroughly. Cover, lower heat, and
  simmer 1 hour or until meat is tender. Season to taste with salt and
  pepper.
  
  Stir frequently during cooking, and add a little hot water if
  necessary to prevent burning.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An Easy Lamb Stew -- I got this recipe from my mom. I'm not sure
  where she got it. It's not a typical cacciatore (i.e. smothered in
  tomato sauce); instead, it's tart and tastes of herbs. It smells
  great when it's cooking. It's very easy to make.  Yield:  Serves 4 to
  6.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20-30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      4    Loin or rib lamb chops
           -- each 1 to 1 1/2" thick
    1/2 c  Beef, veal or chicken stock
      1 tb Fresh chives; minced
      1 tb Dijon mustard or other hot
           -homemade mustard
           Salt and pepper; to taste
 
  Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet.  Sear chops quickly on both sides
  to seal in juices.  Reduce heat to medium and allow to cook, turning
  several times, to desired doneness - 10 to 12 minutes. (To test, make
  a small cut next to the bone.  If it's light pink, it's perfect.)
  Pour off some of the fat from the pan.
  
  Remove cooked chops to a heated platter and keep warm. To deglaze, add
  stock to skillet and stir, scraping up any meat bits from bottom of
  pan. Reduce over high heat until slightly thickened. Remove pan from
  heat (turn heat to low); stir in chives and mustard. Return pan to
  low heat to warm the mustard, but do not allow to boil. Add any
  juices that may have accumulated around chops.  Season with salt and
  pepper. Serve sauce at once, poured over lamb chops.
  
  Enright suggests serving this with buttered noodles and broiled tomato
  halves.

  * Boniato - a Carribbean Sweet potato that is not as sweet as an
  American sweet potato - you can substitute any good boiling potato,
  such as Yukon Gold. NOTE: While this dish is traditionally made with
  kid, other meats, poultry or seafood are all delicious in this
  recipe. Heat 1/2 T of the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
  Season lamb with salt and pepper and brown on all sides, working in
  batches if necessary to keep from crowding the pan. With a slotted
  spoon, transfer the lamb to a platter lined with paper towels. Pour
  off any fat. Heat the remaining 1/2 T oil over medium heat.  Add
  onions, scallions or chives, garlic and ginger; cook, stirring, until

  hour. Add boniatos or potatoes and calabaza or squash and continue to
  cook, covered, for 30 minutes more, or until very tender. Add
  additional stock or water as necessary to keep the stew moist. (The
  stew can be prepared 2 days ahead to this stage and reheated.)  Just
  before serving, stir in lime juice and adjust seasonings with salt
  and pepper. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve.

  This looks pretty tasty++lamb fillets stuffed with minced chicken and
  served with potato pancakes.  The presentation looks like something
  seen through a kaleidoscope++overlapping triangles formed by the
  three lamb fillets, the potato pancakes, the morels and the sauces.
  Here again, I believe that "shallots" are in reality scallions. The
  "pork net" is more than likely a web of caul fat.

  To prepare: 1. Soak morels over night in cold water and wash
  thoroughly Discard stalks. 2.  Cut off and discard lamb fillet's
  stringy part. Season fillet with salt and pepper. Using barbecue
  skewers, pierce through fillet lengthways, stretching meat apart
  slightly to form a central hole about 1.5 cms wide. Stuff chicken
  force meat into hole (one way is to use a piping or icing bag). 3. To
  make port wine sauce: either make a beef stock which includes sauteed
  mixed vegetables, herbs (rosemary, thyme and black pepper) and tomato
  paste, or liquefy the contents of a gravy sauce packet to produce a
  thick 1/3 cup of gravy.  Add port wine, maintaining a thick
  consistency. Keep warm. 4. To make chive cream sauce: saute chopped
  shallots in a little oil, add Madeira wine, few drops of white wine,
  and chicken stock.  Boil until thick, then add cream. Strain and add
  chopped chives, pinch of sugar, and salt and pepper according to
  taste. Keep warm. 5. Make 12 small golden-brown potato pancakes. Keep
  warm.
  
  To cook: 1. Saute morels in butter, with seasoning (salt, pepper and
  chicken stock, according to taste) for 2 to 3 minutes. 2. Lightly
  blanch broccoli florets, then discard stalks. Saute florets in butter
  with seasoning (salt, pepper and chicken stock, according to taste)
  for 1 to 2 minutes. 3.  Cut stalks off lettuce and blanch leaves.
  Wrap one layer of lettuce leaves around stuffed lamb.  Then wrap it
  completely with sheet of pork net, folding net over the ends to
  enclose them. 4. Pan-fry stuffed lamb in melted butter (a
  soupspoonful) over a low flame for approximately 5 minutes until
  lightly browned. 5. Remove lamb to a roasting dish and roast in its
  own juices in an oven (250F) for 20 to 25 minutes, turning it every 4
  or 5 minutes. 6.  When lamb is cooled, remove from oven, and
  carefully take off pork net wrapping. Slice the lettuce-wrapped
  fillet into 12 portions.
  
  To present: 1. Dress centre of each plate with a large spoonful of
  chive cream sauce. 2.  Spoon out three separate portions of port wine
  sauce so that they touch the chive cream sauce. 3. Lay lamb slices
  sideways on port wine sauce. 4.  Place three potato pancakes in
  spaces between lamb slices and lay a broccoli floret on each pancake.
  5. Garnish chive cream sauce with morels and a central heap of diced
  tomato. Scatter a few specks of truffle over each lamb slice, and a
  sprinkling of chopped chives over central garnish display.

      Title: LAMB HASH LYONNAISE
 Categories: Other meat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Onions; minced
      2 tb Butter or margarine
      1 c  Tomato sauce; canned
      1 c  Lamb gravy; (leftover)
      1 tb Chopped parsley
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper
    1/8 ts Marjoram
    1/8 ts Tarragon
    1/8 ts Dill
    1/8 ts Thyme
    1/8 ts Garlic powder
      3    Cooked lamb; (leftovers)
 
  Recipe by: Howard Mann <howard.mann@DEEPCOVE.COM> Saute the onions in
  the butter until limp. Add the tomato sauce, gravy, par and
  seasonings and simmer, covered, for 5 minutes. Put the lamb through
  the fine blade of a meat grinder (food processor  would probably do
  the trick) combine with the above mixture. Blend well and transfer to
  a lightly oiled baking dish.
  
  If the lamb mixture is not for immediate use,cover, cool, refrigerate
  and t freeze. Store up to 1 month) Otherwise, put the dish in a 425
  degree oven f 30 minutes while you make 2 cups of mashed potatoes.
  Remove the dish, reduc the oven temperature to 350 degrees, top the
  lamb with the mashed potatoes, sprinkle with about 2 tablespoons of
  grated Romano, Parmesan or Cheddar cheese, return to the oven and
  bake for about 20 minutes.
  
        4    Servings.
  
  NOTES: We had a fair bit of roast lamb over after a family Easter
  dinner and thoug we would try a "Leftover" recipe. This is what we
  did and it made quite an acceptable dinner. The recipe below,which
  came from Hazel Meyer's Freezer Cook Book, just invites
  improvisation. (For instance, we had no lamb gravy and used some beef
  Oxo dissolved in hot water). This may have been done before on this
  List but, if not, perhaps we might get some postings on what do do
  with leftovers of various kinds of meat? The cook book we have has
  other leftover recipes and, if there is interest,we could post them
  from ti to time.

      Title: LAMB IN COOK POT
 Categories: Chinese, Lamb, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Lean, boneless lamb from
           -leg or shoulder
      2 oz Cellophane noodles
    1/4 lb Fresh spinach
    1/4 lb Celery cabbage

    1/2 ts Chopped garlic
    1/2    Tb finely chopped peeled
           -ginger root
    1/8 c  Finely chopped parsley
 
  I picked up a nice little Mongolian fire pot at a sale this weekend.
  That makes two that I have now.  The other is a highly polished brass
  museum piece that I never use for cooking because it's such a hassle
  to clean up. This one is smaller and, with the exterior parts being
  made of a matte finish aluminum, much easier to keep clean. This is
  the kind you'd see in a Chinese or Japanese place and is just the
  right size for two to four diners.  This one also has a neato
  adjustable grate to control the heat.
  
  I found this recipe stuffed inside the pot.  It was hand-typed. The
  amounts called for in it would be too much for the little pot I found
  it in, but is sounds quite good and is probably authentic. You
  generally don't find Nam Yuey (red bean curd cheese) called for in
  Westernized recipes. The pot is a neat touch, but this can be made
  just as effectively in a fondue pot or in a sauce pan on a tabletop
  burner++in anything that gets the broth hot enough to cook the
  ingredients.
  
  Freeze lamb for 2 or 3 hours for ease in slicing.  Cut against the
  grain into paper thin slices.  Then cut slices into 2 x 2 inch
  pieces. Cover cellophane noodles with 1 cup warm water and soak for
  30 minutes. Drain and cut into 6 inch lengths.  Wash spinach leaves
  under cold running water and pat dry with paper towel. Arrange on
  platter along with noodles. Trim greens and root ends of the cabbage.
  Separate into stalks and wash thoroughly.  Cut each stalk into small
  pieces and drop into pot of boiling water.  Take out in 2 minutes,
  dry and place with spinach and noodles. Combine soy sauce,
  sesame-seed oil, sherry, brown sugar, peanut butter pepper and bean
  curd.  Mix thoroughly, then take 1 tablespoon of the sauce and put
  into each of 4 bowls. Reserve the rest and place in small bowl.
  
  Preheat your broiler to its highest point.  Place 8 to 10 charcoal
  briquettes side by side in baking pan lined with heavy aluminum foil
  and place under broiler. Heat for 10 to 15 minutes until white ash
  forms on briquettes.  Transfer to funnel of cook pot with tongs. Put
  fireproof (asbestos) mat on table and place cook pot on it. Bring
  chicken broth to a boil then pour it into the cook pot. Give each
  person a plate of lamb and a soup bowl.  Drop the scallions, garlic,
  ginger, and parsley into the boiling stock. Each person cooks own
  lamb with fondue fork and then dips it into sauce in soup bowl. Extra
  sauce is also placed on table.
  
  When the lamb has been used, ladle a little of the remaining stock
  into each bowl.  Add the noodles and vegetables in the remaining
  stock in the cook pot, for a minute or two then ladle with broth into
  bowls as another course.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

      Title: LAMB LEG
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -========
 
  Ingredients:
  
  Leg of lamb garlic fresh rosemary lemon juice olive oil Well, this is
  how I make it.  I always make it on a Sunday, so on Saturday night I:
  
  Make slits in the lamb and insert slivers of garlic and fresh
  rosemary Rub the lamb all over with lemon juice and olive oil (I use
  my hands).
  
  I leave the lamb overnight in my (very cool) kitchen. You should
  probably put it in the fridge.
  
  On Sunday morning, I get up, rush around and realise I am late for
  church. At 10.30 I wrap the lamb loosly in foil and sit it in a
  roasting tray. I put it in the oven, light the oven and set it to 150
  deg.C. Then I run out the door.
  
  At about 12.45 I walk back through the door to the gorgeous smell of
  cooking lamb.  I unwrap it and replace it in the over for as long as
  the potatoes and veg take to cook. When the veg are done, the lamb is
  juicy, falling of the bone tender and wonderful to eat. It is not
  remotely pink, though  pink lamb is a treat I save for restaurants.
  
  I have never tried making this on another day of the week, but you
  could, and I've only ever timed it using a church service I expect a
  clock would work too. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40

 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -========
 
  Ingredients:
  
  Leg of lamb lot of garlic some ginger and rosemary a little soy sauce
  Well Julia Child's method of butterflying the leg is best in my
  opinion... Simply butterfly it (ie debone and cut large sections so
  they flop open and the whole piece of meat lays flat ~1.5 2" thick).
  
  Place dish or glass roasting pan to marinate with lotsa garlic (you
  can never have too much garlic), some ginger, rosemary and I add a
  little soy sauce. You may off course vary the spices to your liking.
  Let sit for at least 2 hours.
  
  And here's the best part you can broil it or grill it and it cooks (to
  pink) in ~15  20 minutes..  Let sit for 10 mins after cooking and
  slice down... Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Virgin olive oil; PLUS
      2 tb Virgin olive oil
      2 lb Boneless lamb stew meat
      1    Celery stalk; finely minced
      1 sm Carrot; finely minced
      1 tb Finely minced garlic
      6 c  Veal, lamb or chicken stock
    3/4 c  Dried flageolet beans
           -=OR=- Red kidney beans
      4    Sprigs fresh oregano
           -=OR=- Marjoram, -=OR=-
      1 tb -Dried Marjoram
      4    Plum tomatoes
    3/4 c  Uncooked elbow macaroni

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
           -=OR=- Romano cheese
      1 sm Onion; finely minced
           Freshly ground pepper
           Virgin olive oil
 
  IN A DUTCH OVEN or 3-quart heavy pot, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil
  over high heat on top of the stove. Add the lamb in batches and brown
  well on all sides. Do not crowd the pot or the meat will steam rather
  than brown. Remove and reserve as pieces become brown. Discard fat.
  Preheat oven to 350F. When all the meat has browned, lower heat to
  low, add 2 tablespoons oil and add the celery, carrot and garlic.
  Cook, stirring, 1 minute. Return the meat to the pot. Add the stock
  and beans. Bring to a boil, add the marjoram or oregano, cover, and
  bake 1 1/2 hours, or until the lamb is cooked and the beans are
  tender. Meanwhile, using a small paring knife, cut off tip and stem
  of the tomatoes. Remove the seeds and core, leaving only firm, outer
  pulp. Slice one side of each tomato and lay it flat on work surface.
  Cut into 1/4-inch lengthwise strips, pile up strips and cut across
  into 1/4-inch pieces. Reserve on a plate until needed. Add the
  macaroni to the casserole, replace in oven, and cook, covered,
  another 20 minutes, or until pasta is tender. Remove the fresh herb
  sprigs and add the tomatoes. Transfer to a large tureen or divide
  among individual soup bowls. Offer grated cheese, minced onions,
  ground pepper and olive oil as garnishes at the table.

     12    Phyllo sheets

MMMMM------------------------FOR SERVING-----------------------------
           Confectioners' sugar
           Ground cinnamon
 
  Warm 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter in
  a heavy skillet and saute the onion over low heat until soft, about 8
  minutes.  Raise the heat, add the meat, and saute until lightly
  browned, breaking up any lumps with a wooden spoon.  Add the
  tomatoes, honey, cinnamon, salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the pepper, and
  bring to a boil. Add the stock, bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and
  simmer 15 minutes, or until almost all the liquid has evaporated.
  Add the marjoram and parsley, and additional cinnamon, marjoram, and
  pepper to taste (do not add salt at this point, as the cheese mixture
  is salty). Set aside, or refrigerate for up to 24 hours. Heat the
  oven to 375 F. Press the myzithra through a sieve or food mill into a
  bowl.  Combine with the feta, nutmeg, remaining 1/2 teaspoon pepper,
  and the egg yolks, cover and set aside. Combine the remaining 4
  tablespoons butter and olive oil in a small saucepan, and melt over
  very low heat.  Brush a heavy baking sheet with some of this mixture.
  Lay the phyllo sheets one on top of another and cut in half crosswise
  to make 24 sheets.  Tightly rewrap half the sheets and refrigerate.
  Lay 1 of the remaining sheets on a clean work surface, with a long
  end facing you, and brush lightly with the butter mixture.  Lay a
  second sheet on top, brush it with the mixture, and repeat with a
  third sheet. Lay another sheet on top. Divide the meat mixture into 6
  portions. Place 1 portion on the bottom third of the top phyllo sheet
  and shape it into a sausage about 8 inches long. Divide the cheese
  filling into 6 portions and spread 1 portion over the meat.  Fold the
  bottom edges of the phyllo layers over the filling, then fold over
  the 2 sides, and roll up to make a firm neat parcel.  Place on the
  baking sheet and repeat with the remaining phyllo and filling. Brush
  the rolls with the remaining butter mixture and bake 25 to 30
  minutes, or until deep golden brown. Drain on paper towels, sprinkle
  liberally with the confectioners' sugar and cinnamon, and transfer to
  a warm platter.

      Yield: 10 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      2 tb Butter or margarine
      1 md Onion; chopped
  1 1/2 lb Lean lamb (pref.leg), ground
      1 ts Ground cinnamon (or more)
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
      1 c  Tomato sauce or puree
           - diluted w/ water & warmed
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley

      6 tb Butter; melted
 
  In a frying pan, heat the 2 tablespoons butter and cook the onion

  stirring with a fork until the raw color disappears. Season the meat
  with cinnamon, salt, pepper, then stir in the tomato sauce and
  parsley. Cover the pan and simmer for 20 minutes. (This much can be
  cooked a day in advance and stored in the refrigerator.) Meanwhile,
  soak the toast slices in the milk to make a soft mixture, and add to
  the meat along with the eggs and cheese. Mix the filling with a
  wooden spoon, taste, and add more cinnamon if you like.
  
  Butter the bottom and sides of a 9 x 12 x 3 inch baking pan. Spread 6
  filo sheets, brushing melted butter in between the sheets, making
  sure the pasry fits the sides and bottom of the pan. Pour in the
  filling, spreading evenly with a spatula. Cover with the remaining 6
  filo sheets, brushing with butter as before. Flute the edges with two
  fingers or a fork and brush the top with butter. Using a sharp knife,
  score the top 3 filo sheets into square or diamond shapes. Bake for
  40 to 50 minutes in a moderately slow oven (325 F), raising the
  temperature to 350 F during the last 10 minutes. Remove from the oven
  and let stand on a rack for 15 minutes. Cut into diamonds or squares
  and serve warm.

           Juice of 1 lemon
           Paprika
           Black pepper
           Chili peppers
 
  Recipe by: Yaara Di segni <msyaara@PLUTO.MSCC.HUJI.AC.IL> Make a few
  cuts in the roast so spices can be inserted in the cuts. Deep cuts
  can also be made to facilitate serving.
  
  Put the leg in a baking pan with the spices rubbed all over the
  roast. mix the soup with the lemon juice and add about a quarter of
  quantity to the roast.
  
  Roast in a preheated oven at 210 (Celsius) for 10 minute and then
  turn the meat over. Lower heat to 150 degrees andf keep baking for
  about 25 minutes for each kg of meat. Every 10 minutes baste with the
  liquids and add someo f the soup&lemon souce. every few times turn
  the roast.
  
  The baking times are according to wht's written in the recipe we
  have. As our oven doesn't have temperture settings (the oven is 25
  years old and the writing on the knob disappeared....) we only
  guessed the temperature but yet it came out great. It was the best
  dish of the evening and although it looked somewhat overdone from the
  outside it was as soft as butter.

      Title: LAMB SANS MINT
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Leg of lamb,
           -butterflied and
           -trimmed
      6 tb Rosemary
           Black pepper
           Green onions
      4 c  Burgundy wine
      2 c  Olive oil
    1/2 c  Lemon juice
      6    Garlic cloves, sliced
      1 tb Oregano
      1 tb Thyme
      1 c  Onion, minced
 
  Carefully trimming the fat from a butterflied leg of lamb, and and
  finish the cut, as needed, so that the lamb lies flat in a butterfly
  shape. A large butterflied leg of lamb should be no more than about 2
  or 3 inches thick.
  
  Take a liberal amount of rosemary, crush it and rub it into the lamb.
  When crushing it, don't turn it into dust, just break it. Sprinkle
  some black pepper on the cut side of the meat.
  
  Combine the remaining ingredients (wine, green onions, olive oil,
  lemon juice, garlic, oregano, thyme and onion) into a marinade. Place
  the lamb in a shallow dish or bowl, cover as much as possible with
  the marinade, and marinate in a refrigerator, covered, for 4 to 24
  hours. Turn at intervals to marinate evenly.
  
  Grill over mesquite and charcoal on a grill with a tight-fitting lid,
  such as a Weber. Cook on one side for 25 minutes, occasionally
  spooning some leftover marinade onto the uncooked side, then turn and
  cook about 20 more minutes. cooking. Make a small cut in the thickest
  part of the lamb to check for doneness: when the center is still
  pink, but not raw, take the lamb off and prepare to serve. Remember
  that the lamb will continue to cook after you take it off the grill.
  
  Serve the lamb cut-side down (pretty side up). Garnish with uncooked
  green onions.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Grilled butterflied leg of lamb -- I devised this recipe after
  being unable to find an appropriate recipe in the library. It is
  always well received, and it looks impressive far out of proportion
  to its difficulty. Because it is simple and difficult to screw up, it

      Title: LAMB SAUSAGE
 Categories: Lamb, Sausage
      Yield: 14 Patties
 
      2 lb Lamb, fat removed
      1 lb Pork
    1/4 lb Fresh fatback
      2 tb Cayenne pepper
      1 tb Cumin
    1/2 ts Garlic powder
      2 ts Salt
 
  Ask the butcher to grind the lamb, pork, and fatback together, or do
  it yourself in a meat grinder.
  
  In a small bowl, mix the pepper, cumin, garlic powder, and salt with 4
  tablespoons of water.
  
  Put the meat in a large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of the spice mix and
  knead it in with your hands. This amount makes a fairly hot mix. If
  you don't like spicy foods, use 1 tablespoon of the mix, then fry a
  bit of the meat and taste it. You can always add more if it's not hot
  enough.
  
  Either pack the mixture into sausage casings or shape it into
  patties. When ready to use, heat them in a covered pan with a little
  water, then remove the cover and cook the sausage until no redness
  shows. Makes 20 5-inch links or 14 to 16 patties.

      9    Lamb shanks
      2 lg Leeks, chopped
      3    Cloves garlic, chopped
      2    Rashers bacon, chopped
    500 g  Brown lentils
      1    Sliced carrot
      1    Stalk celery, sliced
      1 tb Chopped fresh oregano
           Red wine *
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  * Red wine and water to cover.
  
  Lamb shanks, which cost next to nothing, develop a succulent
  gelatinous quality when cooked slowly, and saturate the lentils with
  flavour.
  
  In a little olive oil, brown nine lamb shanks (get the butcher to saw
  them into pieces) on all sides. Transfer to a large pan. In the same
  oil, fry 2 large leeks, 3 cloves garlic, chopped together with 2
  rashers of bacon, chopped, until the leeks are soft.
  
  Add the onion and bacon mixture to the saucepan, then add 500 g brown
  lentils, a sliced carrot, a stick of celery, sliced, a tablespoonful
  of chopped fresh oregano (or use dried) and cover with a mixture of
  red wine and water. Do not season at this stage.
  
  Cook very slowly for about 2 hours or until the lamb shanks are very
  tender. Check from time to time to make sure the pot does not boil
  dry and add more liquid if necessary.
  
  Towards the end of the cooking time, taste and season. Transfer to a
  serving dish and scatter liberally with chopped parsley.

      Title: LAMB SHISH KEBAB
 Categories: Meats, Main dish, Marinades
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    Green Peppers
      2 lg Yellow onions
      2 lb Leg of lamb or shoulder of
           Lamb, cut into 1 1/2" cubes
    1/2 c  Olive oil
    1/2 ts Oregano
    1/2 ts Dried mint or
      1 tb Fresh mint
      2    Garlic cloves, crushed
      1 tb Light soy sauce
 
  Cut the green peppers first in halves and then in thirds the long way.
  Remove the seeds and cut each piece across. You now have 12 squares of
  green pepper.
    Peel the yellow onions and cut in half across the middle. Cut each
  piece in quarters. Peel the layers so that you have 6 pieces about
  the same size as the green pepper squares.
    Place the green peppers and onions in a large mixing bowl along
  with the lamb.
    Make a sauce of the olive oil, oregano, mint (more if fresh mint),
  garlic and soy sauce. Mix well, and pour over the meat and
  vegetables. Mix well again and let sit for 3 hours.
    Arrange on skewers in this order: onion, meat, green pepper, meat,
  onion, meat, green pepper, meat. End with an onion. Grill until
  lightly browned on all sides, approximately 15 minutes (don't
  overcook).
    These can also be broiled in the oven.
    You can substitute good beef cubes for the lamb and it still is one
  of the best!

      Title: LAMB SHOULDER IN PASTRY (GUILAINN CHAOIREOLA
 Categories: Irish, Main dish, Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     12 oz Shortcrust or flaky pastry
      3 lb Boned shoulder of lamb
      6 tb Butter
      1 tb Mixed chopped herbs
           Salt and black pepper
           Milk or egg to glaze
 
  Make the pastry and chill for at least 1 hour before using. See that
  the lamb is fairly free of fat, and securely tied: put in a roasting
  pan and rub with about a third of the butter. Put into a very hot
  oven, 450F for 20-30 minutes. Take out and allow to cool slightly. --
  Miz the remaining butter with the herbs, salt and pepper. Roll out
  the pastry to a piece large enough to wrap around the joint.
  Carefully remove the string from the lamb, trying to retain the
  shape. Put it in the center of the pastry, dampen the edges, and draw
  the pastry up over the top: secure well by squeezing the pastry ends
  and edges together. Turn over so that the fold is underneath, and put
  on a baking sheet. Prick all over the top lightly with a fork, then
  brush with either the milk or beaten egg. Put into 400F oven and cook
  for about 1/2 hour, or until the pastry is nicely browned. Turn the
  sheet once during baking to make sure the browning is even. Serve,
  cut into fairly thick slices.

  1 3/4 lb Piece of boneless lamb
      2 ts Dark soy sauce
      1 tb Light soy sauce
        pn Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
      5 sl Ginger
      1 tb Ginger juice (see note)
      4    Garlic cloves, crushed
      2    Scallions, cut in half and
           -smashed
      2 sm Dried hot peppers, ground
      1 c  Uncooked long-grain rice
      2    Star anise
           Fresh banana leaves (opt,
           -see note)
 
  Cut the meat into "butterfly" slices by making one slice not quite
  all the way through and the second slice all the way through. Pound
  the meat lightly.
  
  Toss the meat with the soy sauces, salt, sugar, ginger, ginger juice,
  garlic, scallions and hot peppers; marinate for 30 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, make the rice powder by putting the rice and star anise
  into a dry skillet and cook while stirring until the rice is brown.
  (It should be thoroughly browned but not scorched.) Spoon the rice
  and anise into a blender++a food processor won't work++ and blend
  until it's the consistency of fine sand. (Don't blend it too finely.)
  
  Line two steamer sections with banana leaves cut to fit. Put half the
  rice powder into a bowl, reserving the rest in a jar for future use,
  and dredge the lamb pieces in the powder, coating them generously.
  
  Arrange them on the banana leaves and steam them for 25 minutes. At
  the end of 15 minutes, sprinkle them with a little water. Serve in
  the steamer.
  
  NOTES:  Ginger juice is made by covering fresh crushed ginger with
  boiling water and letting it stand for 15 minutes or so.
  
  If you can't get banana leaves, the lamb may be steamed on a plate.

 Categories: Meats, Indian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Lamb, cubed
      2 tb Coriander seed
      1 tb Cumin seed
      2 lb Tomatoes, crushed
     14    Garlic cloves, crushed
      6    Bay leaves
           Ginger (fresh), 2 inches,
           -finely chopped
    1/2 ts Black pepper, ground
    1/2 ts Cardamon seed
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Cloves
    1/2 ts Cayenne
      2 ts Mustard seed, ground
      1 tb Turmeric
      1 c  Wine vinegar
      2 md Onions
      2 md Potatoes
      2 tb Butter
 
  Lightly roast the cumin seed and coriander seed by frying with no oil
  for a minute or so, stirring constantly. Grind these and combine them
  into a paste with the other spices, the garlic, ginger and the
  vinegar. Add the lamb to the marinade and mix well. Refrigerate for
  3-24 hours while mixing every few hours as convenient.
  
  Finely chop the onions and potatoes and saute them for
        5    minutes in the butter.
  
  Add lamb and spice paste and simmer over low heat for half an hour.
  The marinating does add a lot of flavor and makes the meat much more
  tender. This can be skipped if need be.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A spicy hot Indian lamb dish -- Very loosely based on Dharamjit
  Singh's recipe in "Indian Cookery:  A Practical Guide." Most
  restaurants that serve this dish pronounce it vinDAloo, with the
  stress on the second syllable.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy (though it's easy to burn the spices while
  roasting them).
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, 1 day marinating, 1 hour cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      2 lb Cubed Lamb
    1/2 c  Unsalted Almonds
 
  Drop the saffron threads into a small bowl or cup, add 1/3 of the
  boiling water and soak for at least 10 minutes. Pour the saffron and
  its soaking liquid into a deep bowl and stir in the yoghurt, caraway
  seeds and salt. Add the lamb and turn it about with a spoon until all
  the pieces are evenly coated.  Marinate the lamb at room temperature
  for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the almonds and the rest of

  remove the lamb from the marinade, add the meat to the casserole, and
  stir over moderate heat until it browns evenly. Stir in the marinade
  and the cold water, then add the almond puree and red pepper and cook
  for 10 minutes stirring occasionally.  Pour in the coconut milk,

    1/4 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ginger; ground
 
  Roast the apples in a baking pan at 450F for about an hour, or until
  they are very soft and begin to burst. (An alternative - and quicker-
  procedure is to peel and boil the apples until they are very soft and
  flaky.) You may leave the apples whole, or break them up. In a large
  saucepan, dissolve the sugar a few tablespoons at a time in the cider
  or ale , tasting for sweetness. Add the spices. Bring to a boil and
  simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Pour the liquid over the apples in a
  large punch bowl, or serve in a large heat resistant mugs. MAKES: 8 1
  cup servings Note: Nuts make a nice accompaniment to Lamb's Wool

      Yield: 20 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      1    Baby lamb or kid, 10-12 kg
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      2    Lemons
    1/4 c  Butter; melted
    1/4 c  Olive oil

MMMMM------------------SPINACH & FETA STUFFING-----------------------
  2 1/2 kg Spinach
      3 c  Chopped spring onions
    3/4 c  Olive oil
      1 c  Short grain rice
  1 1/2 kg Feta cheese
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh dill
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh mint
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  Serves: 20 Oven temperature: 180 C (350 F) Cooking time: 4-5 hours
  
  Wipe lamb inside and out with a damp cloth.  Rub cavity and outside
  of lamb with lemon juice, salt and pepper. Cover and leave aside
  until stuffing is prepared.
  
  Trim roots from spinach and remove discoloured and damaged leaves.
  Wash spinach in several changes of water, drain well and chop
  coarsely.
  
  In a large deep pan (not aluminium) gently fry spring onions in oil
  until soft, add spinach and stir over heat until it wilts. Stir in
  washed rice, cover pan and cook on low heat for 10 minutes until most
  of liquid is absorbed.  Remove from heat and cool.  Break up feta
  into small chunks and add to spinach mixture with herbs. Mix well,
  taste, then add salt if necessary and a generous grinding of pepper.
  Blend thoroughly.
  
  Partly sew up the cavity with white string, pack stuffing in through
  opening and finish sewing up the cavity. Push foreshanks back towards
  body and tie in postition, passing string over back of carcase. Tie
  back legs, leaving them a little apart - tying will prevent them
  splaying outwards. Rub outside again with lemon juice, salt and
  pepper and place on a rack set in a large catering-size baking dish.
  
  Combine melted butter with olive oil and brush half of this over the
  lamb or kid.  Cover dish with large sheets of foil, sealing joins
  with double folds. Press foil under edges of dish to seal completely.
  
  Bake in a moderate oven for 4-5 hours.  After 2 hours lift foil and
  brush meat with butter-oil mixture. Cook for further 1 1/2 to 2
  hours, remove foil, brush again and cook uncovered for 30 minutes or
  until meat is cooked through and browned.  Remove from oven, cover
  with foil and a thick cloth and leave to rest for 30 minutes before
  carving. Lift lamb or kid onto a large wooden board, remove string
  and spoon stuffing onto a platter. Turn the carcase onto its back and
  chop along backbone from the inside with a cleaver. Then chop each
  half into chunks and pile onto platters. Meat on legs may be carved
  into slices.

      Title: LAMBS' KIDNEYS VILLANDRY
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      8    Lamb Kidneys
    200 g  Minced pork or chicken
      1 sm Egg yolk
      1 pn Quatre-epices
    200 g  Pate de foie
      4    Rashers bacon
    100 ml Brandy
    100 ml Creme fraiche
 
  This is a slightly simplified version of a recipe from the bible of
  French cookery, Cuisine et vins de France, by Curnonsky, the French
  gastronome and bon viveur born in 1872.
  
  Skin 8 lambs' kidneys, split them in half and core, keeping the
  halves in pairs.
  
  Mix 200 g minced pork or chicken with 1 small egg yolk, and a pinch of
  quatre-epices (nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon and pepper). Have ready 200 g
  pate de foie. Remove rinds from 4 rashers of bacon and cut them in
  half.
  
  Take each pair of kidney halves and put a thick layer (about 1 cm) of
  the mince mixture on the inside of one half and a thick layer of the
  pate de foie on the other. Sandwich the stuffed halves together
  gently, wrap in half a bacon rasher and secure with one or more
  toothpicks. Lay the bacon and kidney parcels in a lightly oiled dish
  which can go from oven to top of the stove and bake in a very hot
  oven for 10-20 minutes or until cooked through.
  
  Transfer the parcels to a heated serving dish and put the baking dish
  on a hot plate. Deglaze the dish With 100 mL brandy and boil hard to
  reduce. Thicken with 100 mL creme fraiche or sour cream (or use
  evaporated skim milk mixed with a little cornflour), taste and season
  if necessary and pour over the kidneys. Serve.

  parts of Central Asia this dish is made with red beans and I have it
  made with beef, horse, camel, chicken, and venison for the meat
  instead of the lamb. It is excellent anyway it comes.

      Title: LARGE PEARL TAPIOCA PUDDING
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Large pearl tapioca
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
      4 c  Water
      1 c  Chopped English walnuts
      3 c  Brown sugar
           Whipped Cream Topping
      1 ds Salt
 
  This is another unique pudding and a very old recipe. Cooking the
  large pearl tapioca slowly for hours in a brown-sugar sauce gives
  this dessert an intense flavor. The additon of English walnuts
  provides a satisfying crunch. Frequently this pudding was cooked in
  the oven or in a double boiler, but get ideal results, requiring no
  watching, with a crockpot.
  
  Place the tapioca and water in a crockpot.  Soak overnight.
  
  Do not drain tapioca.  Add brown sugar and salt and cook for 12 hours
  on low.
  
  Stir once in a while.  The tapioca becomes clear and the texture is
  gelatinous at the end of the cooking period. Let cool. Add vanilla, a
  bit more salt if needed, and the walnuts. Transfer to a shallow
  serving bowl and spread top liberally with Whipped Cream Topping.
  
  NOTE: Large pearl tapioca requires long, slow cooking to become
  transparent.  And each pearl has a tiny bit of starch in the middle
  of it that sometimes never completely cooks up which, though edible,
  looks unpleasant. The crockpot is absolutely perfect for cooking
  these big pearls--and that little starchy bead completely disappears.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Fresh Ground Beef.
           Mint Leaves.
      3    Cloves Garlic.
      1 tb Shallot - Chopped.
      1 ts Coriander Seeds - Ground.
      1 ts Ground Hot Chili Peppers. *
      1 tb Ground Toasted Rice. **
      1 tb Scallion - chopped.
      2 tb Lime Juice.
      1 ts Salt.
      1 tb Fish Sauce.
           Fresh Raw Vegetables.
 
  * Adjust the amount of ground hot chili pepper to taste. Serve extra
  on the side to be added to the dish as needed.
  
  ** Make toasted rice by browning RAW rice in a hot dry wok or frying
  pan, and then ground coarsely in a blender, OR an acceptable
  substitute is to brown a commercial "cream of rice" in a hot dry
  pan/wok.
  
  Wrap the shallot and garlic in aluminum foil and roast on the stove
  for approx. 2 minutes per side till the content is scorched. Remove
  the content from the foil, mash together well (with mortar & pestle,
  if available) and set aside.
  
  Lightly cook the ground beef in a dry pan/wok until the pink is just
  gone, and place in a bowl.  Let cool for a few minutes. Add fish
  sauce, salt, lime juice, and mix well. Add the mashed garlic/shallot,
  ground coriander seed, toasted rice, ground hot chili, chopped
  scallion, and lightly toss together with a fork. Serve on a bed of
  lettuce leaves and garnish with mint leaves.
  
  This dish should be served with fresh raw assorted vegetables such as:
  chunks of "yard-long bean", nappa leaves (select the more tender inner
  leaves), lettuce leaves (Romaine and other leave lettuces are
  excellent), celery, and so on.

  Green Lasagna To quote the author, "Many years ago, I invited some
  friends to try mu kosher green lasagne. At first they declined my
  invitation (being strictly orthodox, they seldom accepted invitations
  to eat in other people's homes). But when I insisted that I would buy
  everything new -from pots and pans to tablecloth and dishes - they
  accepted. They came early, so I prepared everything with their help.
  We had a lot of fun, and they liked my lasagna so much that they
  asked to stay for supper to eat the leftovers. Of course, I was very
  flattered and delighted that they stayed." Squeeze most of the liquid
  of the spinach. Chop very fine to the consistency of a smooth paste.
  Make dough with spinach, eggs and flour as needed, following the
  directions for pasta - homemade. Roll it thin, sprinkling often with
  flour to avoid sticking . Cut into strips about 5X8 inches. Bring 6
  quarts of water to a boil with 3 Tbsp salt. Cook a few strips at a
  time for 2 minutes, uncovered. Remove from boiling water with a
  slotted spoon and drop into a basin of cold water. Drain and spread
  over a slightly damp cloth. Coat the bottom of a lasagna baking dish
  with 2 Tbsp oil and 1/4 cup tomato sauce. Place in it one layer;
  lightly cover it with tomato sauce and dollops of cheese sauce.
  Sprinkle with some Parmesan cheese and continue to make layers until
  you have used up all the pasta and the sauces. Sprinkle top with
  remaining oil and bake in a 400F oven for approximately 20 minutes.
  Serve with remaining Parmesan cheese in a separate dish. SERVES: 6

     Continue making layers, ending with a layer of lasagne. Sprinkle
  with remaining Permesan cheese. Pour melted butter over all.
     Bake in preheated 400-degree oven 15 minutes or until lasagne is
  piping hot and bubbling.  Makes 4 to
        6    servings.

      Title: LATKES (GRATED POTATO PANCAKES)
 Categories: Potatoes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6    Medium potatoes
      1    Onion
      2    Eggs
    1/2 c  Flour
      1 ts Salt
           Vegetable shortening or
           Oil for frying
 
  Pare and grate potatoes into a mixing bowl.  Squeeze out liquid. Peel
  and grate onion into potatoes.  Add eggs, flour, and salt and stir to
  make a smooth batter that will drop heavily from the spoon. Heap the
  shortening in a heavy frying pan using enough to cover the pancakes
  amply. Drop the batter from a spoon into the hot shortening, making
  pancakes 3 inches in diameter. Fry over moderate heat until brown on
  the underside, turn to brown.  Life out and drain off excess fat on
  paper towel. Pancakes fried in deep fat should be puffed and crisp.
  These pancakes may also be baked in a shallow baking pan for 45
  minutes at 350F until nicely browned. Cut into squares and serve hot.
  They may also be put into a well greased small muffin pan and baked
  45 minutes at 350F.

      Title: LATKES (J.LANG)
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Potatoes, peeled
      1 lg Onion
           Salt, pepper, fat for frying
 
  Grate the potatoes and the onion (easiest in a food processor with a
  grating blade) Put into a tea towel and squeeze dry
  
  Season quite well with salt and lots of pepper
  
  Take a large tablespoon or so of the mixture and shallow fry in 1/2
  inch oil until golden brown, flattening it a bit to form a sort of
  thick potato pancake about tablespoon size when you put it in the
  pan, and turn once so that both sides cook.  Drain on absorbent
  paper, and keep warm in a low oven.  Can re-heat in a microwave.
  
  Good oil is the safest frying medium, but for true authenticity use
  goose fat (for a meat meal), Butter and oil mixed is also good for a
  dairy meal (Kosher dietary laws rigidly separate meat and milk).
  
  Some people add an egg to the mixture, and compensate for the
  additional liquid with flour or matzo meal. Personally I think this
  makes the texture insipid.
  
  If you are feeling fancy, put some metal cookie cutters into the pan,
  and put the potato mixture into these, to get perfect circles.
  
  If you make them thin you can call them galettes (but that is a
  different culture)
  
  For a low fat version (shame!) mix 2 tbsp oil with the potato, and
  spread thin circles on baking parchment. Bake in hot oven turning
  once until crisp. Not authentic.
  
  You will need to make lots. Seventeen Latkes is the most I have known
  anyone eat at one sitting...four or five is normal

  knife inserted in center comes out clean. Cool at room temperature.
  
  When shell and custard are cool, melt chocolate with shortening over
  hot, not boiling, water. Meanwhile, slip custard into shell this way:
  Tilt custard-filled pie plate a bit. With small spatula, gently pull
  custard away from all sides of plate. To complete loosening, hold
  plate level with both hands; shake gently. Now hold custard, tilted,
  over shell, with far edge of custard just above and close to far edge
  of shell; shake gently. As custard slips out, pull plate back toward
  you till custard is in shell. To make chocolate top, dip metal or
  wooden skewer into melted-chocolate mixture and draw it across top of
  pie in crisscross manner, dipping skewer into chocolate as needed.
  Let settle a few minutes; then serve at once.

           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Baking powder
    1/2 c  + 2 tb unsalted butter,
           -softened
    2/3 c  Sugar
      1    Egg
      6 oz Chopped walnuts, ground
      1 ts Finely grated lemon zest
    1/2 c  Seedless raspberry jam
 
  Adjust rack to lower third of oven; preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
  Sift the flour, cinnamon, salt and baking powder onto a strip of
  waxed paper.
  
  Combine the butter and sugar in a large bowl; beat until smooth. Add
  the egg and beat until well blended. Stir in flour mixture, nuts and
  lemon zest just until thoroughly blended.
  
  Divide dough in half. Using floured fingertips, pat half of the dough
  evenly into an ungreased 9-inch square baking pan. Spread jam evenly
  over the dough, stopping 1/2-inch from edges. Set aside.
  
  Roll the remaining dough between 2 pieces of waxed paper to a 9-inch
  square. Place on a baking sheet and refrigerate until firm. Cut dough
  into 14 strips, each 1/2 inch wide. Evenly space 7 of the strips over
  the torte in one direction. Place remaining strips at right angles to
  the first strips, creating a lattice pattern. This technique is not
  actually weaving, but the results are just as impressive.
  
  Bake for 45 minutes, or until light golden. Cool completely before
  cutting into 2-inch squares.
  
  Yields 16 squares. PER SQUARE: 225 calories, 3 g protein, 23 g
  carbohydrate, 14 g fat (5 g saturated), 33 mg cholesterol 44 mg

 Categories: Poultry, Casseroles
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Turkey; cooked, chopped
     10 oz Peas
      4 oz Cheese, cheddar, shredded
    1/2 c  Bread crumbs
    1/4 c  Onions, chopped
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Pepper, black
      1 c  Mayonnaise
      1 cn Crescent dinner rolls
      2 ts Seeds, sesame
 
  Preheat oven to 350.  Combine first 8 ingredients; mix well. Spoon
  into a 12"x8"x2" baking dish that has been sprayed with nonstick
  coating. Separate crescent dough into rectangles; press perforations
  to seal. Cut into 4 long strips and 4 short strips. Arrange strips in
  lattice design across top of your casserole. Sprinkle with sesame
  seeds. Bake 35 minutes. Garnish with radish slices and fresh parsley
  sprigs, if desired.
  
  Sylvia's comments: This was a big hit at our house -- only a little
  strip was left along one edge of the casserole! I used nonfat
  mayonnaise, and bet that nonfat yogurt would work just as well to cut
  down on fat. I was out of peas, so used corn.  And I used leftover
  chicken instead of turkey. Save this one for a neat way to use up
  your leftover Thanksgiving turkey.

  Bake in a preheated 350 F oven for 10 to 12 minutes, until golden.
  Remove and let cool while you prepare the filling. Toss the sugar,
  flour, and salt together.  Lightly beat the egg yolks and cream
  together, then stir into the sugar mixture.  Fold in the rhubarb,
  strawberries, and lemon juice. Spread over the baked crust and bake
  at 350 F for 1 hour, until firm. Beat the egg whites until foamy.
  Beat in the sugar, 1 Tablespoon at a time, until stiff peaks form.
  Spread this meringue over the rhubarb mixture and return to the oven

  and a meringue topping than they are like old-fashioned cookie bars.
  They make a fine dessert, best served fresh.

      Title: LAVASH
 Categories: Breads, Turkish
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 pk Yeast
      2 c  Warm water
      2 tb Sugar
  5 1/2 c  All purpose flour
      2 ts Salt
 
  Lightly oil a bowl for the dough. Mix the yeast, water and sugar in a
  large mixing bowl. Add the flour and salt and mix until it forms a
  well-blended but somewhat soft dough. (resist the temptation to work
  in any more flour than absolutely necessary.) Knead the dough by hand
  or machine. If by hand, turn it out on a floured board and work it
  until it is smooth and elastic, approximately 10 minutes. If using a
  dough hook on an electric mixer, knead the dough at the slowest speed
  for about 5 minutes. Pat the dough into a ball and put it in the
  oiled bowl. Cover the dough with a kitchen towel and set it in a
  warm, draft-free place to rise until the dough has doubled in bulk,
  about 30 to 40 minutes. (A perfect place is a gas oven with its
  slight heat given off by the pilot light; an electric oven, turned on
  low for no more than 2 minutes, then turned off, works equally well.)
  When the dough has doubled, turn it out on a floured board, punch it
  down, and knead it again until there is no air left in it. Divide the
  dough into 8 round mounds, place them on the board, cover again with
  a towel, and let rise until almost doubled, about 30-minutes. While
  the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 450F. Position a rack as
  close as possible to the oven bottom. Flour a 12x15-in baking sheet.
  When the 8 mounds of dough have risen, roll them out, one piece at a
  time into rectangles about 12x15 inches (the size of a standard sheet
  pan) and about as thin as for a pizza. Puncture the entire surface at
  1/2-inch intervals with the tines of a roasting fork. Bake the
  breads, one at a time, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the tops are
  lightly browned.  Remove each finished bread to a wire rack to cool
  and continue baking the remaining breads until all 8 are finished.
  During the baking, if any large bubbles start to puff up, puncture
  them immediately with a fork. The bread in the Middle East is
  traditionally a type of cracker bread called lavash (lawasha in
  Assyrian). This flat leavened bread is available in grocery stores
  and specialty markets and can be eaten as a cracker in the dry, crisp
  form in which it comes. However to serve along with a meal, it is
  preferable to dampen it so that it becomes more breadlike. Moisten
  the lavash, one cracker at a time, under cold running water, making
  sure that both sides are completely wet; place in a plastic bag for 3
  hours, at the end of which time the bread will be pliable and chewy.
  Lavash prepared in this fashion is also used for Aram sandwiches. In
  the old country, a lavash bread would bake in a clay bottomed oven in
  2 to 3 minutes. You can get much the same result baking on a ceramic
  baking tile or directly on the floor of a gas oven.

  Sprinkle yeast into warm water in large bowl and stir until
  dissolved. Add salt. Combine all-purpose and whole wheat flours and
  add enough to yeast mixture to make stiff dough. Turn out on floured
  surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. Shape
  into ball. Place in greased bowl and turn to grease top. Cover and
  let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch down and let
  rise again until doubled, about 30 minutes. Divide dough into 8
  pieces and roll each out on lightly floured surface to very thin
  circle about 9 inches in diameter. Place, one at a time, on baking
  sheet and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake at 400F 5 to 6 minutes, or
  until bread appears dry, lightly browned and blistered. Run palest
  side under hot broiler until lightly browned. Cool and store in dry

 Categories: Seafood, Sauces
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------THE SOUFFLES-----------------------------
      1    Boiled crab; -OR-
      6 oz -Prepared Crabmeat
      6 oz Prepared laverbread
           -OR- nori or spinach
      2 oz Butter
      2 oz Flour
    3/4 pt Milk
      3    Eggs
    1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
           Salt & pepper

MMMMM------------------------COCKLE SAUCE-----------------------------
    1/4 pt White sauce from souffle mix
    1/4 pt Whipping cream
      4 oz Cockles or clams (shelled)
      2 oz Prepared laverbread **
 
  If the crab is whole, pull the body apart and pick out all the meat -
  discarding only the mouthpiece and the grey "dead man's fingers" that
  fringe the inside carapace. For extra flavour, make a stock with crab
  shell, flavoured with a piece of carrot and a quarter of onion, and
  boil down to a couple of well-flavoured tablespoons which can replace
  the equivalent milk in the basic white sauce given above.
  
  Prepare the white sauce; melt the butter in a small pan. Stir in the
  flour and fry gently until the mixture is still pale but sandy. Whisk
  in the milk slowly, beating till you have a thick sauce.  Simmer for
  5 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6. Stir the
  crabmeat and prepared laverbread into the sauce. Season with salt,
  pepper and nutmeg. Separate the eggs.  Beat the whites until quite
  stiff. By now the sauce will be cool enough to stir in the yolks.
  Fold in the whites, turning well to "tire" the mixture.  Taste and
  adjust the seasoning. Butter eight small souffle dishes and spoon in
  the mixture, leaving a finger's worth for expansion. Bake for 10-12
  minutes until puffed up and golden.
  
  Meanwhile make the cockle sauce.  Heat up the reserved white sauce
  with the cream.  Stir in the cockles and laverbread. Season with the
  salt and freshly milled pepper. Serve with the souffles as soon as
  they are ready.

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------THE SOUFFLES-----------------------------
      1    Boiled crab; -OR-
      6 oz -Prepared Crabmeat
      6 oz Prepared laverbread
           -OR- nori or spinach
      2 oz Butter
      2 oz Flour
    3/4 pt Milk
      3    Eggs
    1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
           Salt & pepper

MMMMM------------------------COCKLE SAUCE-----------------------------
    1/4 pt White sauce from souffle mix
    1/4 pt Whipping cream
      4 oz Cockles or clams (shelled)
      2 oz Prepared laverbread **
 
  If the crab is whole, pull the body apart and pick out all the meat -
  discarding only the mouthpiece and the grey "dead man's fingers" that
  fringe the inside carapace. For extra flavour, make a stock with crab
  shell, flavoured with a piece of carrot and a quarter of onion, and
  boil down to a couple of well-flavoured tablespoons which can replace
  the equivalent milk in the basic white sauce given above.
  
  Prepare the white sauce; melt the butter in a small pan. Stir in the
  flour and fry gently until the mixture is still pale but sandy. Whisk
  in the milk slowly, beating till you have a thick sauce. Simmer for 5
  minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6. Stir the
  crabmeat and prepared laverbread into the sauce. Season with salt,
  pepper and nutmeg. Separate the eggs.  Beat the whites until quite
  stiff. By now the sauce will be cool enough to stir in the yolks.
  Fold in the whites, turning well to "tire" the mixture. Taste and
  adjust the seasoning. Butter eight small souffle dishes and spoon in
  the mixture, leaving a finger's worth for expansion. Bake for 10-12
  minutes until puffed up and golden.
  
  Meanwhile make the cockle sauce.  Heat up the reserved white sauce
  with the cream.  Stir in the cockles and laverbread. Season with the
  salt and freshly milled pepper. Serve with the souffles as soon as
  they are ready.

      Title: LAVOSH
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Loaves
 
      1 pk Yeast, active, dry 1/4 oz
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
      1 c  Water, warm 115 F
      2 tb Water, warm 115 F
      3 c  Flour, all-purpose
      2 oz Butter, melted (1/2 stick)
      1 tb Seeds, sesame, white, OR
           Onions, chopped
           Seeds, poppy
 
       Pour the yeast into a clean, small, shallow bowl. Add 1 teaspoon
  of the sugar and 1/4 cup of the warm water. Let the mixture stand for
  2 to 3 minutes, then stir to dissolve the yeast completely. Place the
  bowl in a warm, draft-free place for 5 to 10 minutes or until the
  mixture looks foamy and has almost doubled in volume.
  
       Measure your flour into a mixing bowl, and make a well in the
  center of the flour.  Pour the yeast mixture into this center
  depression, and then add the remaining water, sugar, and melted
  butter to the yeast.
  
       Mix the ingredients well with a spoon until a soft, spongy dough
  is formed.  Cover the bowl loosely with a warm, damp cloth, and
  return it to the warm, draft-free spot until the dough again doubles
  in volume, about 45 minutes.
  
       Preheat your oven to 350 F.
  
       When the dough has risen, place it on a lightly floured surface
  and divide it into six equal parts. With a lightly floured rolling
  pin, roll each part into a flat round about 1/4 inch thick.
  
       Place 2 or 3 rounds on each of two or three cookie sheets. Rub
  the surface of the rounds lightly with cool water, and sprinkle each
  with 1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds, or other topping. The water will
  basically help the toppings to adhere to the rounds when baked.
  
       Bake the rounds in the oven on the bottom rack for about 20
  minutes or until the breads are a pale golden brown. (Bake breads in
  "shifts" if oven size does not allow entire recipe to be baked at
  once.)
  
       With a spatula, transfer the breads to a wire rack to cool.
  Breads will keep several days if stored in a dry, air-tight place.

           Salt and pepper -- to taste
      1 c  Lawry's Italian dressing
 
  The day before preparing recipe, soak the black beans in cold water
  in the refrigerator overnight.  Use an over-sized container to allow
  for expansion.
  
  Drain the beans.  Wash thoroughly in cold water to rinse away any
  coloration to the water. Place beans in fresh water to cover in a
  kettle. Cook until the beans are al dente or slightly firm. Pour into
  a colander and discard water. Rinse again in cold water to prevent
  any further cooking.
  
  Meanwhile, saute the bacon until half cooked.  Drain off the fat.
  Continue cooking the bacon, then add diced peppers, onion, garlic,
  cilantro, cumin and cayenne pepper. Saute until peppers are
  tender-crisp. Add to precooked black beans in kettle. Gradually add
  chicken stock and continue cooking until most of the cooking liquid
  is absorbed, leaving a moist, but not dry bean mixture.
  
  Season to taste with the salt and pepper.  Add the Italian dressing
  and stir well. Chill. Stir well before serving. Makes 6 servings.

  We attended a birthday party last night and i managed to wangle the

  on the bottom piece.Place----> middle section of brie on top of
  bottom one and layer it with pastrami.Top with last piece of
  brie;wrap entire wheel in prosciutto.Cover and chill.Thaw pastry 20
  min;unfold and roll on floured surface to a 14 inch square,trim to a
  14 in circle (reserve trimmings) Place brie in center of pastry;brush
  pastry edges with egg mixture.Fold pastry over brie,trimming edges as
  necessary,to enclose cheese.Place on baking sheet;--> seam-side
  down;brush with more egg and garnish with pastry trimmings;brush with
  egg and bake at 375 for 25 minutes or til pastry is golden.Remove
  from oven and transfer to wire rack,let cool 30 minutes before

  1. Water saute onion,pepper garlic, until onion translucent. 2. Add
  spices and let them coat the onion mixture. 3. Add mushrooms and let
  cook briefly for 1-2 minutes. 4. Add can of stewed tomatoes and bring
  to simmer. 5. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. 6. Add corn and
  simmer for 10 more minutes. 7. Add beans and simmer for 5 minutes. 8.
  Warm tortillas so they are pliable, and with a slotted spoon scoop
  mixture in tortilla, roll, and place on dinner plate.  With
  tablespoon, take liquid and pour over tortillas. Repeat until done.
  
  Serves 2 -3 people, depending on side dishes and hunger:)
  
  NOTE: Simmering times are approximate, but you essentially want to
  let it cook so the flavors have combined, but not to reduce to a true
  stew. It should look a soupy stew, so that you have liquid to put on
  tortillas.

  Re "Lazy" - this was based on a recipe posted by Michelle Bass,
  Cooking Echo, Sept 17/93.  I was too lazy to bake the potato, beat
  the egg white or make the sauce.
  
  Mash potato and allow it to cool.  Mix with lemon juice, seasonings,
  onion and then mix in the salmon. Mix in beaten egg.
  
  Form the mixture into 4 patties or 6 smaller ones. Heat a large saute
  pan over medium heat.  Spray or wipe with canola. Fry the cakes for 5
  minutes on each side until golden brown. Serve with lemon wedge.
  
  Makes 2 servings for hungry eaters, 3 smaller ones.

  sprinkle with the cheese mixture.
  
  Or, serve the crepes in individual gratin dishes- 2 per serving - and
  divide the sauce and cheese mixture among them. Can be prepared to
  this point, covered lightly with plastic wrap and refrigerated.
  Remove from fridge at least 30 minutes before baking.
  
  To finish the crepes, bake in a preheated 375F oven for 10-12 minutes
  or until bubbly and beginning to brown. Makes 6 servings of 2 crepes
  each.

      2 tb GRANULATED SUGAR
 
  ds SALT 2 tb VEGETABLE OIL 1 tb PORT 1 tb VANILLA EXTRACT 1 c HEAVY
  CREAM PORT ASPIC: 1 1/4 c  WATER, DIVIDED 1 pk UNFLAVORED POWDERED
  GELATIN 1 c PORT 2 tb GRANULATED SUGAR GARNISH: CONFECTIONERS' SUGAR
  COCOA POWDER Make the chocolate cookie wafers: Position a rack in the
  lower third of the oven and preheat to 275 F. Generously butter two
  large baking sheets. Cut a 3 1/2 inch circle out from a plastic
  coffee can or similar lid. Discard the center. The outer rim of the
  lid will be used as a stencil for the wafers. Into a large stainless
  steel bowl, sift together the flour, the cocoa, and the black pepper.
  In a 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer fitted with the
  wire whip attachment, on medium speed, beat the confectioners' sugar
  and the egg whites until well combined. Continue beating on
  medium-high speed until glossy and stiff peaks form, about 5 to 6
  minutes. With a large rubber spatula, fold 1/3 of the flour mixture
  into the stiff egg white/sugar mixture. Fold in the vanilla and half
  of the melted butter. Fold in another third of the flour mixture.
  Fold in the rest of the melted butter and the flour mixture. Place
  the prepared wafer stencil on the baking sheet. Fill the stencil with
  a very thin layer of the wafer batter, smoothing it evenly with a
  small metal spatula. Repeat this process with the remaining batter.
  Bake the wafers for 12 to 15 minutes, until firm and no longer
  sticky. The wafers should still be pliable when they come out of the
  oven, but will become crisp as they cool. Carefully remove the
  individual wafers to a cooling rack to finish cooling.

        E  *****
  
  Continued:
  
  Make the chocolate mousse: Place the chocolate in a food processor
  fitted with the metal chopping blade.
  
  Process for 20 to 30 seconds, until finely ground. In a small
  saucepan, combine the milk, sugar and salt. Cook over medium heat,
  stirring with a wooden spoon, until the sugar dissolves and the milk
  comes to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat. With the motor of the
  food processor running, pour the hot milk through the feed tube.
  Process for 10 to 20 seconds until the chocolate is completely
  melted. Using a spatula, scrape down the side of the work bowl. Add
  the oil, port, and vanilla; process for 5 to 10 seconds, until the
  mixture is creamy. Scrape the chocolate mixture into a large bowl and
  cool for about 5 minutes, until tepid. In a 4 1/2-quart bowl of a
  heavy-duty electric mixer using the wire whip attachment, whip the
  cream until soft mounds barely start to form and the cream is still
  pourable. Do not overwhip the cream. Using a rubber spatula, gently
  fold one third of the whipped cream into the tepid chocolate mixture
  to lighten it. Fold in the remaining whipped cream. Do not overfold
  the mousse or the texture will be grainy. Refrigerate until ready to
  serve. Make the port aspic: Measure 1/4 cup of water into a
  medium-sized heatproof ramekin. Sprinkle the gelatin over the water
  and let the mixture soften for five minutes. In a medium saucepan,
  set over medium heat, bring the port, 1 cup of the water and the
  sugar to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat. Immediately scrape the
  gelatin mixture into the hot port/sugar mixture and stir to combine.
  Stir occasionally while the mixture cools, for about 15 minutes. Pour
  a thin layer of the port aspic over each of 8 dessert plates. Chill
  until set.
  
  Choose the eight prettiest cookie wafers and reserve them for the
  tops of the desserts. If desired, dust with confectioners' sugar and
  cocoa powder. To serve, arrange one chocolate wafer in the center of
  each dessert plate. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip
  (such as Ateco #5) with the chocolate mousse. Pipe a layer of
  chocolate mousse over each wafer. Place another cookie on top of the
  mousse, and pipe another mousse layer. Finish with the reserved
  chocolate wafers.

      Title: LEAN COOKING TIPS FOR BEEF
 Categories: Beef, Lowcal, Lowfat, Misc, Hints
      Yield: 1 Hints
 
      1    See below
 
  1. Select lean cuts of beef. 2. Choose closely trimmed CHOICE or
  SELECT grade beef cuts. 3. Trim any visable fat from meat before
  cooking, and trim inside separable fat after cooking, but before
  eating. Research shows that when beef is cooked with outside fat on,
  some of the fat liquifies and migrates to the meat. On the average an
  additional 9 percent reduction in fat can be achieved by trimming
  before cooking. 4. Use cooking methods which do not require
  additional fat (non-stick skillets, broiling, roasting on a rack,
  grilling and ETC. 5. Reduce oil called for in marinades to 1 teaspoon
  per 1/2 cup marinade or eliminate completely.

  Preparation : Put in blender (NOT a food processor) and blend until
  smooth on medium. Add in an extremely slow stream, 3 to 4 cups of
  Puritan oil. Blend constantly on about medium. It should become like
  a thick white mayonnaise consistency.  Store in refrigerator in a
  glass container. Serve with meats, as a seasoning in salad dressings
  or on pocket bread sandwiches.  This is a tricky recipe. Sometimes it
  "breaks". That is, it stays thin instead of the mayonnaise
  consistency. The flavors remain the same. If it separates in storage,
  just stir or blend again. (Sister-in-law of Jean Andrews)

 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Uncooked rice NOT instant
      2 ts Salt
      1 ts Pepper
    3/4 ts Allspice
    3/4 ts Cinnamon
      2 tb Melted butter
      2 lb Lean ground lamb
    100    Grape leaves
      1    Sliced fresh lemon
 
  Put the rice in a colander and rinse 3 times with cold water. Combine
  the salt, pepper, allspice and cinnamon and sprinkle over rice,
  stirring to mix well. Add butter and lamb to rice and mix well. Place
  grape leaves in a large bowl and cover with boiling water to soften.
  Remove and drain in colander. Cool. To stuff leaves, place a ts of
  the rice and meat mixture on each leaf. Beginning at the stem end,
  roll the leaf up over the filling, folding the sides of the leaf in,
  halfway toward the center, so the leaf is a nicely tucked, tight
  little package by the time you reach the tip. Repeat with remaining
  leaves and filling. Cover the bottom of a large pan with a few of the
  grape leaves and the lemon slices. In neat rows, arrange the stuffed
  grape leaves on top of the lemon slices. Invert a heavy dish on top
  of the grape leaves, so the bottom of the dish is pressing down on
  them. Add water to the pan, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer
  on low for about 35 minutes, or until stuffed grape leaves are tender.

  The story:
  
  This speciality is the "gourmand cake" of the St. Nicholas Festival
  celebrated annually on 6th December. Presided over by the Bishop of
  Myra, the feast day assumes an air of solemnity in Lucerne itself,
  culminating in a procession through the town. "St. Nicholas" is
  preceded by two heralds and is escorted by frightening "Schmutzli"
  (large puppets) who, according to tradition, are thought to punish
  children who have misbehaved during the year. Only well behaved
  children receive presents from St. Nicholas on this special day.
  
  The recipe:
  
  Whip the cream and mix with molasses (1), spices and salt. Add the
  baking powder, flour, warm milk and diced peel, mixing throughly
  until smooth.
  
  Pour the mixture into a greased and lined sponge ring and bake for
  45-50 minutes at 180 oC.
  
  When baked, brush the top with the pear molasses (2) to glaze.
  
  Recommended drink: tea or coffee.

     mama burns the milk in the black pan as she stirs brown sugar in
  by hand
     bringing it to a simmer humming a wordless tune which echoes
  through the
     room in rhythm with the stirrings of the wooden spoon adding in
  droplets
     of water like tears in the mixture to keep the pan from scalding
  
     when she feels the thickness she pours the steaming liquid into
  rows of
     iron molds scorching her fingers as the steam comes back upon her
  like
     words in retribution but she continues in her motions until the
  pan is
     emptied
  
     mama sits on a broken chair wiping the sweat dripping from her
  hair as
     the cool begins to harden the candies in their prison closing her
  eyes
     only for a moment before rising to put up the milk and sugar and
  to wash
     the cold dirtied pan to make room for evening dinner
  
     as mama boils a pan of water she begins to hum the same wordless
  tune

      Title: LECITHIN PAN COATING
 Categories: Misc
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Grain alcohol; or vodka
      4 ts Lecithin, liquid
 
  This is similar to "PAM".
  
  Place grain alcohol & lecithin in a small jar & shake to mix.
  
  If you don't like using grain alcohol, it says you can use vegetable
  oil in its place.
  
  You can brush this on but a small spray bottle works better. I found
  that the bottle that throat spray comes in works great as it has a
  real fine spray. This stuff is super.

           -JUDI M. PHELPS
      2 lg Bunches fresh leeks; (about
           8 medium size)
      1 lb Lean ground beef
      2 lg Eggs; beaten
    1/4 c  Matzo meal or
           Matzo cake meal
      1 ts ;salt
    1/4 ts Ground black pepper

MMMMM-------------------------FOR FRYING------------------------------
    1/2 c  Matzo cake meal; for
           -coating
           Vegetable oil
      3    To 4 large eggs; beaten
 
  To clean the leeks, cut off and discard the roots and all but 1 to 2
  inches of the green tops.  Slice the leeks in half lengthwise and
  rinse them very well under cool running water to remove any grit.
  Coarsely chop the leeks and put them in a saucepan with water to
  cover. Simmer them, covered, for 20 to 30 minutes, or until they are
  very tender.
  
  Drain the leeks well; then cool them until they can be handled. Use
  your hands to squeeze out all the excess liquid. Grind the leeks in a
  meat grinder (or very coarsely puree them with a food processor).
  
  In a medium-size bowl, combine the leeks with the ground beef, eggs,
  1/4 cup matzo meal, salt, and pepper. Use your hands or a fork to
  blend them well. The mixture should be soft, but firm enough to be
  molded into patties.  Add more matzo meal, if necessary.
  
  Form the leek-meat mixture into small patties about 2 inches wide and
  1/2-inch thick, coating each with cake meal to make it easier to
  shape. In a large skillet, over medium heat, heat oil that is about
  1/4-inch deep until it is hot but not smoking.  Dip each patty into
  the beaten egg to coat it and drain off the excess; then immediately
  set it in the hot oil. Fry the patties until they are golden brown on
  both sides.
   Makes about thirty 2-inch patties.  Source:  The Jewish Holiday

 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Cooked Spinach
      2 tb Oil
      2    Leeks, thinly sliced
     12 oz Puff Pastry
      4 oz Blue Cheese
           Beaten Egg to Glaze
 
  Drain the spinach well, squeezing between two plates to extract all
  the moisture, or dry off in a pan over a low heat.
  
  Heat the oil in a pan and cook the leeks until soft. Stir in the
  spinach and cook for 1 minute. Set aside to cool.
  
  Roll out just under half the pastry to a 8 and a half inch round and
  lift on to a baking sheet. Spoon the spinach and leek mixture over
  the pastry to within 1 inch of the edge.
  
  Cut the cheese into slices and arrange over the spinach mixture. Brush
  pastry border with water
  
  Roll out the remaining pastry to a round, large enough to fit over
  base. Trim and press edges together to seal. Decorate top and edges
  by marking with a sharp knife, taking care not to cut right through
  the pastry. Pierce a hole in the top to allow steam to escape.
  
  Chill for 30 minutes.
  
  Set oven to 220C, 425F, Gas 7. Brush pastry with beaten egg to glaze.
  
  Bake for about 20 minutes until puffed and golden brown. Serve hot or

      Title: LEEK POTATO SOUP
 Categories: Vegetables, Soups
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 ea Large Bunches Leeks
      3 lb Potatoes
      3 ea Large Onions
      2 ea Garlic clusters
      1 qt Milk (optional)
      1 qt Half and Half (optional)
      1 pt Heavy Cream (optional)
      3 c  Chicken Stock (clear)
      3 c  Water
      1 x  Salt and/or Pepper
 
   Peel the potatoes in advance and keep them submerged under cold
  water to prevent discoloration.
  Smash the garlic clusters on their sides to seperate the cloves. Cut
  off the large end of the cloves and crush the clove by laying the
  cloves on a flat surface, and pressing down on them under the side of
  the blade of a wide, bladed knife. Remove the peelings from the
  crushed cloves. (This is a very easy way to peel garlic.)
  Inspect the leeks and remove any parts of the plants that are
  withered or discolored. Chop the onions. Coarsely chop the leeks,
  including the leaves. Saute the leeks, onions, and garlic in peanut
  oil. Peanut oil seems to work best but olive oil or corn oil may be
  used. Saute until tender. Set aside in a strainer to drain any excess
  oil. Select a pot large enough to cook the potatoes with some room to
  spare for the soup. Add 3 cups of chicken stock and 3 cups of water.
  Make sure the chicken stock is clear; containing no fat. If homemade
  chicken stock is not available then substitute with instant chicken
  broth, but use locally prepared stock if possible.
   Cook the potatoes in the stock/water combination for 25 - 30
  minutes, or until done. Remove the potatoes and reduce heat under the
  pot, but keep the liquid hot.
   Drain the potatoes and insure the sauted vegatables are drained.
  Place potatoes and the drained vegatables in a food processor and
  blend on medium to high speed until smooth. Return the blended
  mixture to the liquid in the soup pot. Stir well and increase heat.
  Heat just to boiling. If the soup appears to be too thick at this
  stage slowly add a little more stock or water. If desired add salt
  and pepper to taste.
   The soup is ready to serve at this point, especially as low fat or a
  lite soup. But I like to add milk or cream.
   When the liquid reachs boiling point, add the milk or cream. Stir.
  Milk produces a thinner soup than the cream. Cream or Half-N-Half
  provides a full flavor with more body. Heat to just below the boiling
  point. Be careful at this stage and do not boil after adding the milk
  or cream. Too much heat at this time will cause the soup to stick to
  the pot and loose flavor. Serve immediately with fresh baked bread or
  homemade croutons. Additional comments: The amounts of the
  ingredients are not critical to a successful soup. If you like garlic
  its hard to put too much in this receipe. The amount of onions can be
  varied also. The more onions, the better it seems to be. A ratio of
  one bunch of leeks to one pound of potatoes is OK. But more leeks
  doesn't spoil it either. For people without a large food processor:
  The potatoes can me prepared as if making mashed potatoes (with a
  mixer) but with just potatoes. If the mixture becomes too dry add
  water or milk while beating. Blend the sauted vegetables in the food
  processor and add to the beaten potatoes. Blend until smooth before
  adding to the stock.

MMMMM----------------MARTHA STEWART'S 1996 HOLIDA---------------------
      2 bn Leeks, white parts only
      1    Sheet store-bought puff
           Pastry
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 bn Scallions, chopped
    1/2 ts Kosher salt
    1/4 ts Black pepper
      1 lb Gorgonzola or other blue
           Cheese, crumbled
 
  1. Heat oven to 350 F. Slice white part of each leek into 1/4"
  rounds, and soak in large bowl of water to remove any sand.
  
  2. On lightly floured work surface, roll puff pastry to 1/4"
  thickness, about 12" in diameter. Press puff pastry into bottom and
  sides of 9" round or rectangular tart pan (with removable bottom).
  Run rolling pin across top to trim. (Scraps can be wrapped in plastic
  and frozen for later use.) Carefully line pastry with aluminum foil,
  and weight with beans, rice, or pastry weights. Bake for 10-15
  minutes. When pastry begins to color around edges, remove weights and
  foil, and continue to bake until pastry turns golden brown, 10-12
  minutes. Place pan on wire rack, and let cool completely before
  filling.
  
  3. While pastry bakes, drain sliced leeks, and assemble filling. In
  medium saute pan, warm olive oil over high heat. Saute leeks and
  scallions until soft, about 6 minutes; season with salt and pepper.
  Remove from heat.
  
  4. Fill baked pastry shell with crumbled cheese, and top with sauteed
  leeks and scallions. Bake in back of oven for 20 minutes, or until
  cheese bubbles. Slice and serve immediately.

      Title: LEEKS IN VINAIGRETTE
 Categories: France, Vegetables
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
     12 md Leek; =or
           <dressing>
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      2 tb Dijon mustard (recipe)
    1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Ground black pepper
      2    Shallots, finely chopped
      1 tb Chopped fresh parsley
 
   Trim the root ends from the leeks, leaving the bases intact. Trim
  the tops of the leeks to a uniform length. If you are using very
  young leeks, the green tops are nice and tender and only 1 inch need
  be trimmed. The upper greens of mature leeks tend to be tough and
  stringy, and all but 2 or 3 inches should be removed.
   Place the leeks on a steamer rack and set over gently boiling water.
  Cover and steam the leeks until tender, about 10 minutes for young
  leeks, and up to 20 minutes for medium-sized leeks and quartered
  large leeks.
   While the leeks are steaming, make the dressing. Place the olive oil
  in a small bowl.  Add the mustard and beat together until the oil
  thickens. Add the vinegar, salt, pepper, and shallots. Set aside.
   Arrange the warm leeks on a serving platter.  Pour the dressing
  kover them and turn them gently to coat evenly. Sprinkle with the
  parsley.
   I like the leeks best when they are served slightly warm or at room
  temperature, but they may also be made ahead and served chilled.
  Serves 4.

      2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
 
  Remove dark green ends of leeks and discard. Slit each leek lengthwise
  twice, beginning halfway through center of white part and slitting
  upward in direction of green tops. Dip repeatedly in a sinkful of
  cold water to remove any sand. Cut off roots. In a large saucepan of
  boiling salted water, cook leeks, uncovered, over medium heat about
  10 minutes or until tender. Drain thoroughly. Cut in two or three
  pieces crosswise. Arrange on a platter reconstructing each leek and
  arranging so all point in the same direction.
  
  Cut hard-cooked eggs in half and remove yolks. Chop egg whites
  separately from yolks. In small bowl, stir vinegar with salt and
  pepper, and whisk in oil. Add parsley, taste and adjust seasoning. To
  serve, spoon enough dressing over leeks to moisten them. Sprinkle egg
  whites in a row across their bases and then a row of hazelnuts next
  to the whites, then a row of chopped yolks. Leave top ends of leeks
  showing. Serve remaining dressing separately.

  Strong flavours here - leeks saut‚ed with olives and parsley - that
  are reminiscent of French regional cookery. Lovely with a rice dish,
  or with the crŠpes alla parmigiana parizzi.
  
  Saut‚ the sliced leeks gently in the olive oil, stirring, until they
  begin to soften, about 6-8 minutes. Stir in the stock and bring to
  the boil. Simmer gently, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Add the olives and
  the chopped parsley, and cook, stirring occasionally, for a further
  3-4 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and it is ready to
  serve.

      Title: LEESA'S INSPIRED COLD POTATO SALAD
 Categories: Side dish, Salads, Vegetables, Mark's
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
      1 lb Small new potatoes, unpeeled
      1 ea Lime, halved
           Salt & pepper
           Ground serrano chile
           Jalapeno chiles, sliced
 
  Place the potatoes in a pot of water & bring to a boil. If the
  potatoes are quite small, leave whole, if larger you may need to
  halve or quarter them, but do not make them too small. Simmer
  potatoes until they are cooked through, but do not overcook them.
  Remove from heat, drain & plunge into cold water to stop them
  cooking. Chil lightly in the refrigerator.
  
  When ready to serve, slice the potatoes fairly thickly. Sprinkle with
  salt & pepper & generously spray with the juice of 1/2 a lime, use a
  whole lime if they are small.  Sprinkle with serrano chile powder
  (this is available from Mexican or Spanish style supermarkets &
  imparts a more smoky flavour than ground red chiles) & garnish with
  jalapenoes. Serve as part of a salad buffet.
  
  This is an excellent dish to take on a picnic. Prepare it at the
  picnic, just cook the potatoes before you go & serve as part of a
  salad.

      Title: LEFSE
 Categories: Breads, Christmas
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Milk, scalded
      1 tb Salt
    1/2 c  Lard
      4 c  Flour
 
  Add lard, salt and 2 cups flour to scalded milk and mix well over low
  heat. Remove from fire.  Sift 2 cups of flour on board, add warm
  dough and work in flour. Knead well and cool. This dough can be
  rolled immediately or kept in a cool place for a couple of days. May
  be stored in a plastic bag. Make a small patty, about hamburger size,
  with even sealed edges as you would for pastry.  Flour board lightly
  and with a Scandinavian rolling pin roll patty in all directions,
  keeping the dough round. Roll lightly, stretching dough until it is
  almost as large as the lefse baker. Use pointed stick to handle dough
  when it is transferred from the board to the baker. Brown lightly,
  prick air bubbles, turn and brown other side. It may be necessary to
  change heat control from high to low. This is a soft bread. Serve
  with butter, or butter and sugar. (Note: I don't have either a
  Scandinavian rolling pin or a lefse baker, so I use a regular rolling
  pin and a griddle. This is like a Swedish tortilla! We usually spread
  butter and sprinkled sugar over the lefse then rolled them up and
  DEVOURED them!)

      Title: LEFSE - NORWEGIAN POTATO PANCAKES
 Categories: Norwegian, Breakfast, Pancakes, Potatoes
      Yield: 30 Servings
 
      2 lb Potatoes
    1/4 c  Butter
    1/4 c  Milk
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts MSG
    1/8 ts Black pepper
  2 1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
 
  1. Wash, peel and cook the potatoes. Cut in halves and boil. Drain the
  cooked potatoes. Dry the potatoes by shaking the pan over low heat.
  Mash or rice the potatoes thoroughly. 2. Whip into the potatoes the
  butter and milk, and a mixture of the salt, sugar, MSG and black
  pepper. 3. Whip the potatoes until light and fluffy. Cool the
  potatoes and then chill in the refrigerator. 4. Set a heavy skillet
  or griddle over low heat to warm. Do not grease the skillet or
  griddle. 5. Remove the chilled potatoes from the refrigerator. Add
  about half of the flour and beat until smooth. Beat in enough of the
  remaining flour to make a smooth dough, shape into a ball and turn
  out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll into a round about 1/8 inch
  thick. Cut into 6 inch "rounds. 6. Test the griddle by dropping on it
  a few drops of cold water. If the drops dance around in little beads,
  temperature is about right. Do not grease. 7. Place a lefse "round"
  on the griddle or skillet and cook until browned. Turn and lightly
  brown on the other side. Then, turning frequently, continue cooking
  until the Lefse are lightly browned and dry. Remove and place on a
  clean, dry towel. Cool completely. 8. To serve ... dust with powdered
  sugar, roll and enjoy.

      Title: LEFT-HANDED CHILI
 Categories: Chili, Meats
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Lean beef (stew meat, round,
           -or something similar), cut
           -into
    1/4    Inch chunks or run through
           -your butchers' chili blade
      1 lb Sweet Italian sausage,
           -casing removed
      2 tb Lard, bacon drippings or
           -cooking oil
      1 lg Onion, chopped
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      2 tb To 1/4 cup Hungarian Sweet
           -Paprika (since we suspect
           -you have a
           -problem with capsicum, I'd
           -start with the smaller
           -amount and work up)
      1 tb Ground cumin
      2 tb Mexican oregano, crushed (if
           -you can't get Mexican
           -oregano,
           -substitute Italian oregano,
           -but cut the quantity in
           -half -- or let me
           -know, and I'll mail you
           -some)
      1 ts Coriander seed (not the
           -fresh spice), ground
      1    12-oz  can beer
      2    Beef bouillon cubes
      2 tb Tomato paste
      2    Heaping Tablespoons of masa
           -or cornmeal
           -water as needed
           -salt, WHITE pepper to
           -taste
 
  Melt the lard in a large, heavy pot.  Add the beef and sausage, and
  cook until about half done.  Add the onions and garlic, and cook
  until the onions are transparent, and the meat is nicely browned. Add
  the dry spices, and cook, stirring, until they develop a fragrance.
  
  IMPORTANT -- do not drain off the fat at this point. We'll get rid of
  it later, but it is a flavor carrier, and needed for a while.
  
  Add the tomato paste, beef bouillon cubes, and beer, and enough water
  to barely cover the mixture.  Cover, and simmer on lowest possible
  heat, until the meat is tender (2-3 hours). Stir frequently, and add
  additional water or beer as needed to keep the mixture from burning.
  
  At this point, and in an ideal world, you would refrigerate the chili
  overnight to develop flavors and let the excess fat rise to the top.
  If you absolutely can't wait, skim off as much fat as possible from
  the surface of the mixture.  If you have developed the virtue of
  patience, lift the fat off the mixture and return the pot to the
  fire, bringing it up to a slow simmer before continuing.
  
  Mix the masa or cornmeal with an equal quantity of water, and add to
  the mixture.  Stir, and simmer another half hour or so, stirring
  frequently, and adding additional liquid if the mixture seems too
  thick.
  
  Adjust the seasonings, adding salt (for my taste it shouldn't need
  much) and white pepper (which doesn't contain capsicum, but will give
  the chili a bit of a "bite") to taste.
  
  If you absolutely must have beans in your chili, please, please, cook
  them separately, according to your favorite recipe, and spoon them
  into the bowl, then spoon the chili on top of 'em and mix. (You could
  even do this with heated canned beans, just don't tell me about it ;-)
  
  If you decide to try this, let me know how it turns out. My head says
  it should be pretty good, if mild, chili.

 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter; melted or chicken
           -fat (up to 3T)
      1    Onion; thinly sliced
    1/2 c  Celery; diced

    1/2 ts Pepper
    1/4 c  Cream

MMMMM------------------------HOT BISCUITS-----------------------------

      1 tb Baking powder
      1 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Cream
      2    Eggs; beaten
 
  La fricasee fatuguee
  
  Heat in frying pan 2-3 Tbsp melted butter or turkey or chicken fat.
  Add thinly sliced onion and diced celery. Heat 5-8 minutes over low
  heat, stirring often. Add 2-3 cups cooked turkey. Cook 5 minutes over
  low heat.
  
  Sauce: Brown the chicken fat (I would use butter) and flour well
  before adding water. Add savory, salt and pepper to taste. When sauce
  is smooth and creamy, add 1/4 cup cream and any remaining turkey or
  chicken gravy. Pour over turkey. Simmer 15 minutes, then serve with
  hot biscuits and pickled beets.
  
  Hot Biscuits: Sift together in bowl, flour, baking powder (no error in
  amount) and salt. Mix together cream with 2 beaten eggs. Add to flour
  and mix just enough to moisten; the dough is rather soft and should
  remain lumpy. Stir as little as possible. Drop by spoonfuls on a
  greased cookie sheet. Cook 16 minutes at 400F.
  
  from Mme. Benoit, "In days that followed Christmas, every bit of the
  turkey was used - the bones for soup, the skin, diced and crisped in
  the oven until browned, then served, instead of butter, on toasted
  homemade bread. So, when it came time to make hash from all the
  little bits and pieces, the children felt that the poor turkey must
  be tired (fatiguee), hence the name.

           -(I would use butter)
      3 tb Flour
  2 1/2 c  -Water
    1/2 ts Savory
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper
    1/4 c  Cream

MMMMM------------------------HOT BISCUITS-----------------------------
      2 c  Flour; all purpose
      1 tb Baking powder
      1 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Cream
      2    Eggs; beaten
 
  Heat in frying pan 2-3 Tbsp melted butter or turkey or chicken fat.
  Add thinly sliced onion and diced celery. Heat 5-8 minutes over low
  heat, stirring often. Add 2-3 cups cooked turkey. Cook 5 minutes over
  low heat.
  
  Sauce: Brown the chicken fat (I would use butter) and flour well
  before adding water. Add savory, salt and pepper to taste. When sauce
  is smooth and creamy, add 1/4 cup cream and any remaining turkey or
  chicken gravy. Pour over turkey. Simmer 15 minutes, then serve with
  hot biscuits and pickled beets.
  
  Hot Biscuits: Sift together in bowl, flour, baking powder (no error in
  amount) and salt. Mix together cream with 2 beaten eggs. Add to flour
  and mix just enough to moisten; the dough is rather soft and should
  remain lumpy. Stir as little as possible. Drop by spoonfuls on a
  greased cookie sheet. Cook 16 minutes at 400øF.

      Title: LEFTOVERS TO SAVE FOR SOUP (SOUP INFORMATION)
 Categories: Soups, Information
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      5    Minutes for zucchini or tiny
           -broccoli orcauliflower
           -flowerets.
 
  Any leftovers in cans should be transfered to plastic containers -
  atwist of foil or plastic in the case of anchovies, tomato paste, or
  pimientos - and frozen. Vegetable cooking water (freeze) Leftover
  vegetables (can be frozen, but better if not) Noodles, rice, pasta,
  kasha, beans (freeze) Cream sauce, spaghetti sauce, gravy (freeze)
  
  Before freezing leftover vegetable water, stock, broth, or tomato
  product, cook some finely chopped onion, celery, and carrot in 1 - 2
  Tbsp of butter until they soften, then add the liquid and salt and
  pepper. Freeze the mixture and you will have soup starter. Use 1/3 to
  1/2 cup of each vegetable for 6 cups of soup.
  
  Variations on the soup starter:
  
  Before adding the vegetables, cook 2 slices of diced bacon in the
  butter.
  
  Add 1 Tbsp paprika, chili powder, or curry powder to the vegetables
  as they cook, before adding liquid:  1 Tbsp of flour can be added at
  this time, too, to give the starter a little body.
  
  Sherry or dry red or white wine, about 1/3 cup, can be added before
  the other liquid and allowed to cook down to half. This gives a
  richness to the soup that will ensue.
  
  Add 2 Tbsp of finely chopped parsley to the vegetables.
  
  Add 1/3 cup of finely chopped green pepper.
  
  Once you have the starter, the rest of the liquid can be added. It
  can be more of the same, or perhaps milk. Heavy cream, yogurt, or
  sour cream are added at the end, to heat but not boil, to avoid
  curdling.
  
  The solids you put in can be infinitely varied:
  
  Small pieces of stewing meat or soaked dried beans need about an hour
  to cook.
  
  Fresh vegetables take from about 20 minutes for root vegetables to
  about
  
  Cooked vegetables should be put in just to warm, not to cook any
  further. If they are already overcooked, perhaps it would be better
  to add a little liquid and puree them.
  
  Soup can be thickened by pureeing some or all of it, or for each cup
  of soup add 1 tsp of rice or 3 Tbsp of grated raw potato or 1 Tbsp of
  flour mixed with 2 Tbsp milk, water, or broth.
  
  Finely chopped cabbage can cook for hours in a soup, spinach goes in
  at the very end, for about a minute, remaining bright green.
  
  Cooked ham, in chunks or julienne, sliced frankfurters, and sliced
  garlic sausage have more flavor and give up some of their fat if they
  are lightly sauteed before being added to the soup.

 Categories: Veal, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Anchovies seem to have a natural affinity with veal - consider ossi
  buci, for instance. those not in the know usually cannot pick the
  presence of anchovies in this pot-roasted dish, but they do rave
  about the flavour.
  
  With the tip of a very sharp knife, make incisions all over the
  surface of a leg of veal.  Into each incision, stuff a sliver of
  garlic and a small anchovy fillet. Also insert into the meat 4 to 6
  cloves.
  
  Pour a little of the oil in which the anchovies were packed into the
  palm of your hand, rub your hands together and rub them all over the
  surface of the meat.
  
  Put the leg of veal into an oven proof casserole or Pyrex chicken
  roaster, dust with pepper and surround with slices of 2 large onions.
  
  Add a couple of bay leaves and pour over 300 ml dry white wine. Cover
  the casserole and roast in a 160C oven for 2 to 3 hours.
  
  Makes 4 to 6 servings.

  3/4 cup sugar and baking powder in another bowl. Stir nonfat milk
  mixture just until blended. Pour into 9-inch indented, fluted

  degrees F. about 20 minutes or until cake tests done in the center.
  Let cool in pan 5 minutes. Loosen edges and turn out onto wire rack
  with wax paper underneath. Combine remaining 1/4 cup sugar and lemon
  juice in small sauce pan. Heat to boiling. Simmer about 1 minute or

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Sugar
      2 oz Almond paste (1/4 cup)
      6 ts Chilled butter
      1    Egg yolk
           LEMON FILLING:
      2 md Lemons
      4 tb Butter
      2    Eggs
    1/4 c  Sour cream
    3/4 c  Sugar
      2 tb Confectioners' sugar
 
  ALMOND PASTRY:
  
  PREPARATION AND COOKING:  For The Pastry, adjust the oven rack to low
  position and heat the oven to 350F. Put the flour, salt, sugar and
  almond paste in the workbowl of a food processor fitted with a metal
  blade, or into a medium bowl.  Pulse the mixture, or work it with
  your fingertips, until it resembles coarse meal. Cut the butter into
  1-inch pieces. Pulse, or work, until the mixture again resembles
  coarse meal. Add the egg yolk and pulse, or toss with a fork, until
  dough holds together when pinched.
  
  Press the dough evenly over the bottom and up the side of a 9-inch
  tart pan with a removable bottom.  (Can wrap the crust in the pan and
  freeze for up to 2 days; defrost before baking.) Transfer the tart
  pan to a baking sheet and bake until the crust is golden brown, about
  20 minutes.
  
  For The Filling, grate 2 teaspoons of lemon zest and squeeze 1/3 cup
  of lemon juice into a medium bowl. Melt the butter and whisk it into
  the bowl along with the eggs, sour cream and sugar. Pour the filling
  into the pre-baked crust and return the pan to the oven, baking until
  set, 12 to 15 minutes.  Transfer the tart, in the pan, to a wire rack
  and cool to room temperature.  (Can cover and refrigerate overnight.)
  
  SERVING:  Dust lightly with confectioners' sugar and serve at room
  temperature.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

      Title: LEMON & THYME MARINADE
 Categories: Poultry, French, Marinades
      Yield: 14 Servings
 
      2 tb Strained fresh lemon juice
      2 ts Chopped fresh thyme, OR 3/4
           -tsp dried, crumbled
      2 tb Olive oil OR vegetable oil
 
  This is a tangy marinade, containing equal amounts of lemon juice and
  oil, and is good for rich meats like chicken thighs. It can be used
  for chicken breasts too, but their skin should be on for additional
  protection during grilling or broiling.  Thyme gives this marinade a
  flavor loved in France, but you can substitute oregano for an Italian
  or Greek accent, or mint or cilantro for a Lebanese touch.
  
  Mix ingredients in a small bowl.
  
  Makes about 1/4 cup, enough for about 1 1/2 to 2 lbs poultry.

           -and patted dry
    1/2 c  Fresh lemon juice, about 4

      1 c  Olive oil
      4    Garlic cloves, crushed

           -Tbsp dried
 
  Source: MAINPOUL.ZIP
  
  Freshly ground black pepper, to taste Garnish: lemon peel strips,
  optional
  
  Place chicken pieces in a glass or ceramic bowl. Mix marinade
  ingredients until smooth and well blended. Reserve 1/3 cup, covered
  and refrigerated, for basting while grilling. Pour remaining marinade
  over chicken, turning pieces to coat completely. Marinade, covered
  for 6 to 8 hours or overnight, turning occasionally. Remove chicken
  from refrigerator 20 to 30 minutes before you are ready to grill,
  leaving container covered. When coals are covered with gray ash, oil
  the grill rack. Cook chicken, skin side down first, for about 15
  minutes on each side, brushing with the reserved marinade. Watch
  carefully, as uncovered grills will cook the exteriors faster than a
  covered grill. Pieces are done when exterior is golden brown and
  clear juices run when the chicken is pierced with a sharp fork.
  Discard any unused marinade. Garnish with strips of lemon peel, if
  desired. Total cooking time:30 minutes. Serves 6.

      Title: LEMON AFTERSHAVE
 Categories: Try it, Nonfood
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 pt Alcohol
      1 qt Distilled Water
      1 oz Tincture of Benzoin
      1 dr Oil of Bergamot
      2 dr Lemon Oil OR:
      2 oz Tincture of Lemon Peel
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
 
  The tangy tingling sensation it causes after being splashed on is one
  way to describe an aftershave. Most aftershaves act as astringents;
  they help firm skin tone and close skin pores when applied
  immediately after shaving. Many aftershaves contain alcohol, which
  possesses antibacterial abilities, helping to prevent infections of
  knicks or shaving cuts. It also should contain glycerine and/or other
  ingredients known to be beneficial to skin care. Glycerine will help
  counter the drying effects on the skin, and the chafing and
  irritation that can develop with dry skin.
  
  *Most drug stores contain all of the above tinctures and oils. Herb
  and health food shops carry the essential oils.
  
  DaisyLin's comments: Here are some aftershave recipes that I have
  used. My ex liked the lime one best. They are really good. I still
  make it for him once in a while. And you can get neat bottles at a
  healthfood or herb store, or some specialty stores...and the
  essential oils can be found at a health food/herb store, and the
  tinctures etc can be found at some pharmacies, I suggest calling
  around. I found it at three old type pharmacies. Like Rexall.

      Title: LEMON BUNDT CAKE IN JARS
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 pk Lemon cake mix; * see note
      1 sm Pkg instant lemon pudding mi
      4    Eggs
           (or egg substitute)
    1/2 c  Oil; * see note
      1 c  Warm (not hot) orange juice
           Orange juice
           Frosting: see directions
 
  This is my "signature" cake"..I've made it under all sorts of
  circumstances including a gas cooker in London that went down in the
  middle of baking...also in high altitude when I neglected to follow
  those specific directions...EVen the "shell" was devoured and no one
  even noticed! This cake is a winner....the changes to lower the fat
  are in (). Because I'm starting with the mix, there is already a
  certain amount of fat, but it's not too bad.) * use any kind of cake
  mix without the pudding in it. Use less oil if you wish--1/8 to 1/4
  cup.
     Beat together ( use a food processor or a hand mixer or anything
  that's handy)....until batter is smooth.
     Put batter into bundt pan sprayed with PAM **  OR, fill 4-6 pint
  size greased Mason jars 1/2 full.   Bake for 45 minutes at 350. Every
  oven is different, so you may bake longer or shorter.
      I've only made the jars once and I baked 2 jars along with a small
  bundt pan.  It took the normal time. With the jars only, I would test
  at 35 minutes. (I used one of those bamboo thin skewers - it's like a
  long toothpick! I thought I was so clever!) You'll see the cake
  rising and turning brown and it pulls away a little from the sides of
  the jar. With the regular cake I do the following: Turn out of the
  pan immediately onto the serving plate. (Don't, of course, take the
  cakes out of the jars!) Poke holes in the cake with a fork (in the
  jar) spoon over the following "icing":
     1 1/2 c. powdered sugar (or any amount you want) grated lemon rind
  (in proportion to sugar) Lemon juice to make "runny" consistency. It
  should drip from the spoon. Spoon it right over the tops of the cakes
  in the jar - or over the bundt cake shape. Put the lids on and screw
  down the rings. Everything worked fine.
     I tasted one of them after a few days...naturally! The cake was
  delicious and didn't lose any of its flavor with the substitutions.
  This cake is always a hit, and SO easy to make. It takes exactly one
  hour from start to finish!    Ronda Furgatch Linda Caldwell Food BB

  low heat and stir to dissolve the gelatin.  Remove from the heat and
  let cool to room temperature.
  
  In a large bowl, whip cream until just stiff.  Cover and refrigerate
  until needed.
  
  In a deep bowl, combine egg whites with the salt. Beat until soft
  peaks form.  Gradually add 1 cup of the confectioners' sugar and beat
  until stiff peaks form.
  
  In another bowl, beat the butter until soft and fluffy. Add 1 cup of
  the confectioners' sugar and beat until smooth. One at a time, add
  the egg yolks, alternating with the dissolved gelatin and the
  remaining 1 cup confectioners' sugar.  Continue to beat until smooth.
  Fold in one-third of the egg whites. Quickly but gently fold in the
  remaining egg whites.
  
  Beat the remaining lemon juice into the whipped cream and fold into
  the mousse.  Turn into a serving dish or stemmed wine glasses, cover
  and refrigerate until chilled and set, about 3 hours.

      Title: LEMON CARAMEL CUSTARD
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      1 pn Cream of tartar
  3 1/2 c  Milk
      1 c  Heavy cream
      5 lg Eggs
      5 lg Egg yolks
      2 tb Fresh lemon juice
      1 tb Lemon zest
      1 ts Vanilla
 
  In a small heavy saucepan, combine 3/4 cup of sugar, cream of tartar,
  and 1/4 cup water. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring until the
  sugar is dissolved. Boil the syrup, covered, for 1 minute. Remove the
  lid and boil the syrup, undisturbed, until it begins to turn golden.
  Continue to boil the syrup, swirling it and tilting the pan, until it
  is deep golden caramel. Pour the caramel into a 9x5 loaf pan, tilt
  the pan to coat the bottom and sides, and let it cool.
  
  In a large saucepan, scald the milk with the cream over moderate heat.
   In a large heatproof bowl, whisk together the whole eggs, egg yolks
  , and the remaining sugar, until the mixture is light and frothy. Add
  the scalded milk in a slow stream, stirring constantly, and stir in
  the lemon juice, zest, and vanilla.  Set the pan in a larger deeper
  baking pan and strain the custard mixture into the loaf pan. Cover
  the loaf pan with heavy-duty foil and add enough hot water to the
  larger pan so that it reaches 2/3 of the way up the outside of the
  loaf pan.
  
  Bake the custard in the middle of a preheated 325f oven for 80
  minutes. Remove the loaf pan from the larger one and remove the foil.
   (The custard will not appear set in the middle but it will set as it
  cools.)
  
  Let the custard cool and then chill it, covered, overnight. Run a thin
  knife around the edge of the custard, invert a serving plate over it
  and invert the custard onto the plate.

      Title: LEMON CATS' PAWS
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 35 Cookies
 
           Cookie dough
    3/4 c  Sliced unblanched almonds
  2 1/4 c  Plus 2 tablespoons
           All-purpose flour, divided
    2/3 c  Granulated sugar
    1/3 c  Confectioners' sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  (2 sticks) unsalted butter,
           Chilled and cut into
    1/2    -inch cubes
      1 lg Egg, chilled
      4 ts Vanilla extract
      4 ts Finely grated lemon zest
           Assembly:
     15 oz Swiss dark chocolate,
           Coarsely chopped
 
  Make the cookie dough: 1. Position a rack in the center of the oven
  and preheat to 375~F. Put three heavy, large ungreased baking sheets
  in the refrigerator
  
  2. In a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade, process
  the almonds with 1 cup of the flour for 3O to 45 seconds, or until
  the mixture is ground to a fine powder. Add the remaining 1 1/4 cups
  plus 2 tablespoons flour; granulated sugar confectioners' sugar and
  salt. Process for 10 to 15 seconds, or until the mixture is
  thoroughly blended.
  
  3. Evenly distribute the butter cubes in a circle around the chopping
  blade. Add the egg, vanilla and lemon zest. Process for 45 to 60
  seconds, or until the mixture is creamy. (Make sure that the butter
  is completely blended into the batter)
  
  4. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a closed star tip (such as Ateco #6)
  with one-fourth of the cookie dough. (Slightly open the teeth on the
  end of the pastry tip so that any small nut particles do not get
  caught between the points as you pipe.)
  
  5. Remove a chilled baking sheet from the refrigerator. Starting at
  the left-hand side of the midsection of the baking sheet, pipe 1
  1/2-inch long "cats' paws" about 2 inches apart, across the center of
  the baking sheet. (This will enable you to pipe straight and even
  lines across the baking sheet.) Continue piping until the bottom half
  of the baking sheet is covered with piped cookies. Turn the baking
  sheet 180 degrees and continue piping cats' paws onto the other half
  of the baking sheet.
  
  6. Refrigerate the baking sheet for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the
  piped cookie dough is firm. Pipe the rest of the cookie dough onto
  the remaining chilled baking sheets and refrigerate.
  
  7. Bake the cookies one baking sheet at a time for 12 to 15 minutes,
  or until lightly browned. Turn the baking sheet halfway through
  baking for even browning. Using a metal pancake spatula, immediately

      Title: LEMON CATS' PAWS (SPRITZ VARIATION)
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
    3/4 c  Almonds, sliced unblanched
  2 1/3 c  Flour; divided
    2/3 c  Sugar
    1/3 c  Sugar, confectioners
    1/2 ts Salt
      1    Egg; chilled
      4 ts Vanilla extract
      4 ts Lemon zest
     15 oz Chocolate, Swiss dark;
           -coarsely chopped
      1 c  Butter, unsalted; chilled &
           -cut into 1/2" cubes
 
  Make the cookie dough:
  
  Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 F. Put
  three heavy, large ungreased baking sheets in the refrigerator.
  
  In a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade, process the
  almonds with 1 cup of the flour for 3O to 45 seconds, or until the
  mixture is ground to a fine powder. Add the remaining 1 1/4 cups plus
  2 table- spoons flour; granulated sugar confectioners' sugar and
  salt. Process for 10 to 15 seconds, or until the mixture is
  thoroughly blended.
  
  Evenly distribute the butter cubes in a circle around the chopping
  blade. Add the egg, vanilla and lemon zest. Process for 45 to 60
  seconds, or until the mixture is creamy. (Make sure that the butter
  is completely blended into the batter.)
  
  Fill a pastry bag fitted with a closed star tip (such as Ateco #6)
  with one-fourth of the cookie dough. (Slightly open the teeth on the
  end of the pastry tip so that any small nut particles do not get
  caught between the points as you pipe.)
  
  Remove a chilled baking sheet from the refrigerator. Starting at the
  left-hand side of the midsection of the baking sheet, pipe 1 1/2-inch
  long "cats' paws" about 2 inches apart, across the center of the
  baking sheet. (This will enable you to pipe straight and even lines
  across the baking sheet.) Continue piping until the bottom half of
  the baking sheet is covered with piped cookies. Turn the baking sheet
  180 degrees and continue piping cats' paws onto the other half of the
  baking sheet.
  
  Refrigerate the baking sheet for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the piped
  cookie dough is firm. Pipe the rest of the cookie dough onto the
  remaining chilled baking sheets and refrigerate.
  
  Bake the cookies one baking sheet at a time for 12 to 15 minutes, or
  until lightly browned. Turn the baking sheet halfway through baking
  for even browning. Using a metal pancake spatula, immediately
  transfer the cookies to wire racks to cool.
  
  Assemble the cookies:
  
  Melt the dark chocolate according to the melting instructions in the
  Chocolate Key OR temper the chocolate following the tempering
  instructions on page 72. Scrape the chocolate mixture into a small
  heatproof bowl. Place the bowl of chocolate over a smaller bowl of
  warm (86 F to 90 F) water.
  
  Using a small metal cake spatula, coat the flat side of half of the
  cookies with a thin layer of melted or tempered chocolate. Top each
  chocolate-coated cookie half with a second cookie. Place the cookies
  on a waxed paper-lined baking sheet and refrigerate for 5 to 10
  minutes or until the chocolate is set.
  
  Dip the pointed tips of the cookies halfway into the melted or
  tempered chocolate. Place the cookies back onto the waxed paper-lined
  baking sheet and refrigerate 5 to 10 minutes, or until the chocolate
  is set. Store the cookies dipped in melted chocolate in a airtight
  container in the refrig- erator for up to two weeks. The cookies
  filled with tempered chocolate may be stored in an airtight container
  at room temperature for up to three weeks.

      Title: LEMON CHICKEN #3
 Categories: Chinese, Chicken
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Whole chicken breasts
    1/3 c  Water chestnut powder
    1/3 c  Lemon sauce
      5 c  Vegetable oil
      1 tb Water
    1/2 tb Sugar
           Cornstarch paste
 
  This is one of the most appealing and unique recipes in Chinese cook-
  ing that goes by this name.
  
  Preparation:  Pull chicken skin from breasts, then carefully pull
  meat from breast bone, keeping meat intact. Thin inner filet will
  come off separately. Cut meat across the grain into strips about 3/4"
  wide by 1 1/2" long.  Put water chestnut powder in bowl large enough
  to hold chicken, & deep enough to keep powder from flying around. Add
  chicken pieces a few at a time, tossing gently to thoroughly coat
  each piece; they should be entirely white.  Leave them in bowl while
  you prepare sauce.
  
  Sauce:  In small saucepan, mix prepared lemon sauce (we suggest Mee
  Chun brand from Hong Kong), water & sugar. Bring to boil; reduce heat
  & simmer for 2 minutes. Just before serving, thicken with cornstarch
  paste to consistency of a fudge sauce.
  
  Deep-frying:  In deep-fryer or wok, slowly heat oil to deep-frying
  temperature.  (Don't let oil smoke.)  Test with piece of chicken: it
  should reach a medium brown in about 35 seconds. Fry chicken in
  batches of 5-6 pieces at a time; drain.  Place on serving plate,
  keeping warm until ready to serve.  Pour lemon sauce over chicken at
  last minute.

      Title: LEMON CHICKEN (04/26/93)
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Whole chicken breasts
    1/3 c  Water chestnut powder
    1/3 c  Lemon sauce
      5 c  Vegetable oil
      1 tb Water
    1/2 tb Sugar
           Cornstarch paste
 
  Preparation:  Pull chicken skin from breasts, then carefully pull
  meat from breast bone, keeping meat intact. Thin inner filet will
  come off separately. Cut meat across the grain into strips about 3/4"
  wide by 1 1/2" long.  Put water chestnut powder in bowl large enough
  to hold chicken, & deep enough to keep powder from flying around. Add
  chicken pieces a few at a time, tossing gently to thoroughly coat
  each piece; they should be entirely white.  Leave them in bowl while
  you prepare sauce. Sauce: In small saucepan, mix prepared lemon sauce
  (we suggest Mee Chun brand from Hong Kong), water & sugar. Bring to
  boil; reduce heat & simmer for 2 minutes. Just before serving,
  thicken with cornstarch paste to consistency of a fudge sauce.
  Deep-frying: In deep-fryer or wok, slowly heat oil to deep-frying
  temperature. (Don't let oil smoke.) Test with piece of chicken: it
  should reach a medium brown in about 35 seconds. Fry chicken in
  batches of 5-6 pieces at a time; drain. Place on serving plate,
  keeping warm until ready to serve.  Pour lemon sauce over chicken at
  last minute. Serves 4

      1 c  Rice, uncooked
           Parmesan cheese.
 
  Chicken breasts can be split to 4 pieces or cubed to bite size. In
  deep fry pan, saute chicken and mushrooms in half of the white wine
  with basil, lemon, and chives until mostly done. Splash in rest of
  wine (or extra) as needed.  Add tomato sauce, cover, and simmer for
  20 minutes, or until thickened, stirring occasionally. When done,
  lemon wedges should be thoroughly cooked, and can be eaten.  Serve
  over steamed rice. Top with a sprinkle of parmesan or mozarella (not
  too much) and a little sprinkle of chives. (It's good without the
  cheese, too.) Garnish with a fresh sprig of basil and wedges from
  unused half of lemon. Serves 2 (plenty). NOTE: The white wine can be
  replaced with apple juice. As a matter of fact, I like mushrooms
  cooked in apple juice until it's reduced down to almost nothing. A
  lot less calories than cooking them in butter, and tastes great.
  Sometimes I'll put in a clove of garlic. (I haven't tried this when
  using apple juice instead of wine yet.) D PILEGGI (TDJR42A) Recipe:

 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
  2 1/4 c  Cake flour
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      1 tb Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
    1/2 c  Lemon juice
    1/4 c  Water
      6 lg Eggs, separated
           Zest of one lemon,
           Finely minced

           Lemon Glaze (opt. see recipe
           Shreds of lemon zest
           For garnish (optional)
 
  COMMENTS: As the name implies, a chiffon cake is a light, high cake -
  actually a hybrid of an angle and butter cake. Serve this cake plain,
  with lemon curd, with whipped cream or with a nest of strawberries in
  the center. Lightly grease a 10-inch tube or bundt cake pan. Preheat
  oven to 325'F. Sift together the cake flour, sugar, baking powder and
  salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add oil, lemon
  juice, water, egg yolks and lemon zest. Beat until smooth. Beat egg
  whites until foamy, then dust with cream of tartar. Beat until the
  whites are stiff and glossy-looking. Stir 1/4 of the beaten egg
  whites into the cake batter. Gently fold in the remaining egg whites.
  Pour into prepared tube or bundt pan. Bake about 55 minutes in
  preheated oven until cake tests done. Remove from oven and invert
  pan. Let cake cool this way for about 1 hour. To loosen the cake for
  serving , run a knife around the edges. Unmold on to serving plate
  and glaze, if desired, then garnish with shreds of lemon zest. LEMON
  GLAZE: Combine two cups sifted icing sugar and three tablespoons of
  fresh lemon juice to make a thin glaze.

      Title: LEMON CREAM MERINGUE PIE
 Categories: 
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Flaky Pie Dough for a 1crust
           Pie -- about 10 ounces
           Filling:
      2 c  Milk
    2/3 c  Sugar
      3 md Lemons -- (3 to 4)
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
      4    Egg yolks
      2 tb Unsalted butter -- softened
           Meringue topping:
      4    Egg whites
    2/3 c  Sugar
      1 pn Salt
 
  To make the filling, combine milk and sugar in a nonreactive saucepan,
  preferably enameled iron. Strip the zest from the lemons with a sharp
  vegetable peeler, making sure you remove the yellow zest but none of
  the white pith beneath. If you do remove some of the white pith,
  scrape it off the strips of zest with the point of a paring knife and
  discard it. Add the zest to the milk and sugar and bring to a simmer
  over low heat. Remove from heat and allow to steep for 5 minutes;
  remove the strips of zest with a slotted spoon or skimmer anddiscard
  them. Squeeze lemons to make 1/2 cup strained juice. Place juice in a
  mixing bowl and whisk in cornstarch, then yolks. Return milk and
  sugar mixture to a boil over low heat and whisk about a third of the
  boiling milk into the lemon juice mixture. Return remaining milk and
  sugar mixture to a boil once more and whisk the lemon juice and yolk
  mixture back into it, whisking constantly until the filling comes to
  a boil and thickens. Allow to boil, whisking constantly, for about
  30seconds. Remove from heat, whisk in butter and pour into a
  nonreactive bowl. Press plastic wrap against the surface of the
  filling and chill until it is approximately 75 degrees. (If you
  prepare the filling in advance, let it come to room temperature
  before proceeding.) Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and
  preheat to 350 degrees. Roll out the dough to make bottom crust and
  arrange in pan. Chill crust until firm. To bake the crust, pierce it
  all over with the tines of a fork at 1/2inch intervals. Line it with
  a disk of parchment or wax paper and fill with cherry stones or dried
  beans. Bake about 20 minutes, until lightly colored. Remove paper and
  beans and continue baking until the crust is a deep golden brown.
  Cool crust on a rack. Spread the cooled filling evenly in the cooled
  crust. Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 400
  degrees.To make the meringue bring a small pan of water to a boil.
  Lower heat so that watersimmers. Combine egg whites, sugar and salt
  in the bowl of the mixer or if you are using a hand whisk another
  heatproof bowl. Place bowl over pan of simmering water and whisk
  gently for about 2 minutes, until egg whites are hot (about 140
  degrees) and sugar has dissolved. Whip meringue on medium speed until
  it has cooled and is able to hold a shape, but it should not be dry.
  Distribute spoonfuls of the meringue all over the top of the pie,
  then use the back of a spoon or a small offset metal spatula to
  spread the meringue evenly. It should cover the top of the pie and
  touch the edges of the crust all around. Here and there, bring up the
  surface of the meringue so that it is swirled. Place the pie on a
  cookie sheet and bake for about 5 to 10 minutes, until the meringue
  is colored evenly. Cool on a rack. Yield: One 9 inch pie

      Title: LEMON CURD (BON APPETIT)
 Categories: Spreads, Pies, Canning, Fruits
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  (1 stick) butter
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
  1 1/4 c  Strained fresh lemon juice
      4    Eggs
      2 tb Grated lemon zest
 
  This versatile sauce is delicious spread on English muffins, makes a
  wonderful cake or pie filling and is also an easy way to enhance plain
  yogurt.  It has a tendency to darken after about 2 months, so it is
  best to make only what you can use within that length of time.
  
  Makes about 4 1/2-pint jars
  
  Melt butter in top of double boiler over simmering water. Add
  remaining ingredients and blend well. Continue cooking, stirring
  frequently, until thick and smooth, about 25 to 30 minutes. Ladle
  into sterilized jars and seal with lids.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3    Eggs, size 3 (medium)
      1 tb Self-raising flour
  2 2/3 oz Castor (fine) sugar
    7/8 c  Milk
      2    Large lemons (3 small)
           Pinch of salt
      1 tb Icing (confectioners) sugar
           Butter for greasing
 
  Separate the eggs. Sift the flour. Fine grate most of rind off the
  lemons and extract juice.
  
  Beat the yolks with the caster (fine grain) sugar until light, pale
  and creamy. Whisk the milk, flour, lemon juice and rind into the egg
  yolk mix.
  
  In another bowl whisk the egg whites with the salt, adding the icing
  sugar gradually (I sieve it through a tea strainer). Continue to
  whisk until stiff but not dry (important!). Fold into the lemon
  mixture.
  
  Grease a deep 1 litre ovenproof dish (I use a 2 lb non-stick bread
  tin). Pour the mixture into it. Stand the dish in a shallow pan of
  cold water (about 1/4 to 1/2 inch ) and bake in a moderate oven at
  180C/350F/gas mark 4 for 1 hour (check after 50 minutes and see if
  top is becoming dark brown - if so remove).
  
  Note: This pudding has a light spongy top with lemon sauce
  underneath. It is quite tart - the way I love it ~ but I suppose
  those of the sweet tooth may want to add more sugar or put less rind
  in.

  for each layer to cool before you can add the next, but once you
  taste it, you will think the work is WELL worthwhile....

  FIRST LAYER:  Mix flour, butter and nuts together until crumbly.
  Press into 9x13 pan. Bake in 350 F oven for 15 minutes. SECOND LAYER:
  Beat cheese and icing sugar together well.  Beat whipping cream until
  stiff. Fold into cream cheese mixture.  Spread over cooled crust.

      Title: LEMON GELATO
 Categories: Italian, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6 md Lemons
  1 1/3 c  Sugar
      6    Egg yolks
  1 1/3 c  Heavy cream
    1/8 ts Salt
  2 2/3 c  Half-and-half
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
 
  PREPARATION:  Grate the zest of 6 lemons and set aside in a bowl with
  the sugar.  OR, use a vegetable peeler to remove 3/4 cup zest from
  the lemons and process the lemon strips with the sugar in a food
  processor until zest is minced, about 30 seconds.  Set lemons aside.
  
  COOKING:  Whisk the egg yolks with the cream and salt in a heatproof
  mixing bowl.  Put the half-and-half and lemon-sugar in a medium non-
  aluminum saucepan.  Bring liquid to a simmer, stirring to dissolve
  the sugar. Remove pan from heat.  Slowly whisk the hot half-and-half
  into the egg yolk mixture.  Then return the partially cooked custard
  to the saucepan. Stir constantly over medium-low heat until mixture
  begins to thicken slightly and coats the back of a spoon, about 5
  minutes (the approximate consistency of unwhipped heavy cream). Pour
  hot custard into a bowl without straining. Stir in the vanilla.  Put
  a sheet of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the custard to
  prevent skin from forming. Set custard aside at room temperature to
  cool.  (Can cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 48
  hours.)
  
  FREEZING:  Squeeze 3/4 cup juice from the lemons and stir juice into
  cooled custard.  Transfer the custard mixture to an ice cream maker
  and freeze according to manufacrurer's instructions.
  
  Makes about 1 1/2 quarts.

      Title: LEMON GROVE BUNDT CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Bundt, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -Jo Anne Merrill
      1 c  Butter; softened
      2 c  Sugar
      3 lg Eggs
      3 c  Flour, All-Purpose; sifted
    1/2 ts Baking Soda
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Buttermilk
      2 tb Lemon Peel; grated
      2 tb Lemon Juice; fresh
           Lemon Icing:
    1/4 c  Butter; softened
      2 c  Sugar, powdered
  1 1/2 tb Lemon Peel; grated
    1/4 c  Lemon Juice; fresh
 
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In a very large bowl, cream butter (or
  margarine) until very light; slowly add sugar until mixture is very
  light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time.
   In another bowl, sift flour, baking soda and salt together. Add flour
  mixture alternately with buttermilk to butter mixture. Begin and end
  with flour. Mix in lemon peel and juice.
   Pour batter into greased and floured 10-inch tube or 12-inch bundt
  pan. Bake for 65-75 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center
  comes out clean. Place pan on rack for 10 minutes to cool. Turn cake
  out of pan onto rack. Spread with as much lemon icing as the cake can
  absorb (about a third of the icing) Allow cake to cool completely
  then frost with remaining icing.
   ICING: Blend butter and sugar together in a medium bowl. Mix in peel
  and juice, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the frosting is of spreading
  consistency. If the entire amount of juice is used, the icing will be
  thin and possibly difficult to spread evenly, however a very tangy
  frosting greatly enhances the flavor of the cake.
    This cake was a second place winner at the Del Mar fair.

 Categories: Ice cream
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
  1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
  1 1/2 c  Milk
    2/3 c  Sugar
      3    Egg yolks
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2    Lemon; zest only
      2 tb Lemon juice; fresh
    1/4 c  Lemon verbena leaves*
    1/4 c  Lemon balm leaves*
      1 tb Lemon balm leaves; chopped
 
  * leaves are measured by "hardpacking:" press down in the measuring
  cup with your fingers
  
  In a heavy 2-quart saucepan or double boiler over medium-low heat,
  stir and heat the cream, milk, and sugar until the sugar dissolves.
  Do not boil.
  
  In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks lightly. While whisking, pour 1
  cup of the hot cream mixture into the bowl, then pour the egg mixture
  back into the saucepan and place over medium-low heat. Stir
  constantly with a wooden spoon (don't let the mixture boil; it could
  curdle) for about 8 minutes, or until it begins to thicken and coats
  the spoon. To test for doneness, dip a metal spoon into the mixture
  and run your finger across the back. The custard is done when your
  finger leaves a clear, clean trail. A candy thermometer should read
  175-180 degrees F.
  
  Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Stir in the
  lemon peel, lemon juice, and hard-packed lemon herbs into the hot
  ice-cream base. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1
  hour (the longer it is refrigerated, the stronger the flavor will be).
  
  Strain the mixture and add the chopped lemon balm leaves for color.
  Pour the mixture into an ice-cream maker and freeze according to the
  manufacturer's instructions.

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      8 oz Container nonfat yogurt
      6    Whole Graham Crackers
      1 tb Canola Oil
    1/2 c  Honey
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
      2    Lowfat vanilla yogurt
           -(8 oz each)
    1/2 c  Egg beaters® 99% egg
           Substitute
    1/2 c  Lemon Juice
    1/2 ts Lemon Extract
    1/2 ts Almond Extract
      3    Egg Whites
    1/2 ts Cream Of Tartar
      1 tb Honey
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  Place a coffee filter in a medium strainer. Spoon the plain yogurt
  into the filter and set the strainer over a deep bowl. Cover,
  refrigerate and allow to drain for 8 hours or overnight. Discard the
  drained-off whey. Refrigerate yogurt until needed.
  
  Crumble the graham crackers into the work bowl of a foodprocessor.
  Process with on/off turns to make crumbs. Add the canola oil and
  process to combine.
  
  Coat a 10-inch pie plate with nostick spray. Press the crumbs into

  In a 2-quart saucepan, whisk together 1/2 cup honey and the
  cornstarch. Whisk in the vanilla yogurt and drained plain yogurt.
  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens
  and boils.
  
  Remove from heat. Pour some of the hot mixture into the egg
  substitute. Stir. Very slowly whisk that mixture back into the
  remaining hot mixture. Reduce heat to low. Cook, stirring constantly,
  for 2 minutes. Remove from heat  and whisk in lemon juice, lemon
  extract and almond extract. Spoon into the prepared crust. In a

      Title: LEMON JELLY
 Categories: None
      Yield: 2 Pints
 
     12    LEMONS
      4 lg APPLES (tart--Granny Smith)
           Water To cover
      3 c  GRANULATED SUGAR
 
  Slice the lemons, including the rind, seeds and all, thin, and place
  into a saucepan.
  
  Core the apples, but do not peel, and chop coarsely. Add the apples
  to the pan and pour in enough water to just cover the fruit. Cook
  over moderate heat, until the fruit becomes mushy.
  
  Pour the mixture into a jelly bag or a colander lined with several
  thicknesses of damp cheesecloth and let drip into a bowl for about an
  hour. Using a spoon, force as much liquid through the cheesecloth as
  possible.
  
  Measure the juice; you should have about 4 cups. For each cup of
  juice, add 3/4 cup of sugar.
  
  Return to the pan and boil for another 15 minutes or so, until the
  mixture reaches the jelly stage, about 220- to 225-degrees F on a
  candy thermometer. To be absolutely certain, place a tablespoon of
  the hot mixture into a saucer and set it in the freezer for a few
  minutes. If it jells, the mixture is ready.
  
  Pour the jelly into HOT, sterilized jars and seal.
  
  Process in boiling water bath for 10 minutes. Or it may be store in a
  covered container in the refrigerator for several months.

      Title: LEMON KRUMKAKES
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Butter
      3 ea Eggs, beaten
      1 c  Whipped cream
    1/2 ts Grated lemon rind
  1 1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
 
  Cream together sugar and butter.  Add eggs, whipped cream and lemon
  rind. Add enough flour to make a batter that spreads easily on the
  iron. COOKING INSTRUCTIONS:
    You will need a krumkake iron, which fits over a 7-inch burner
  surface (gas or electric).  Always use moderate heat.
    For each baking period, the iron should be lightly rubbed at the
  beginning with unsalted butter, but after this initial greasing,
  nothing more is required. The batter needs a preliminary testing, as
  it is quite variable, depending on the condition of the flour, so do
  NOT add at once all the flour called for in the recipe. Test the
  batter for consistency by baking 1 teaspoonful first. The iron is
  geared to use 1 tablespoon of batter for each wafer, and it should
  spread easily over the whole surface but should not run over when
  pressed down. If the batter is too thin, add more flour.  Should any
  batter drip over, lift the iron off its frame and cut off the excess
  batter with a knife run along the edge of the iron.
    Cook each wafer about 2 minutes on each side or until barely
  colored. As soon as you remove it from the iron, roll it on a wooden
  spoon handle or cone form, and, when cool, fill it.

    1/2 ts Garlic salt
      1    Garlic clove -- minced
      2 tb Margarine
    1/2 ts Lemon pepper
 
  Mix the cornstarch and brown sugar in a small saucepan. Stir in the
  remaining ingredients except the onions. Blend well and heat to
  boiling. Add the onions and immediately turn heat down. Stir
  constantly until sauce is thickened and bubbling. Use this sauce to
  baste poultry during last few minutes of grilling. You can also use
  this sauce as a marinade. Put sauce in a heavy plastic bag along with
  2 to 3 pounds of chicken pieces and marinate for from 2 hours to
  overnight, turning bag to coat all sides of meat. Use the leftover
  sauce to brush on chicken while grilling. This recipe doubles nicely.
  
  Yield: 3/4 to 1 cup sauce/marinade.

      Title: LEMON MARMALADE
 Categories: Condiments, Jams
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 lb Lemons - Meyer or regular
           -lemons
      8 c  Sugar - granulated (actually
           -8 to 10 cups)
 
  Slice the lemons as thin as possible.  Discard ends. Remove all seeds
  and tie them in a square of doubled cheesecloth. Put lemons and seed
  bag in a nonreactive bowl with enough water to cover. Let stand
  overnight.
  
  Measure the lemons and water into a wide, shallow, nonreactive pan.
  Add an equal volume of sugar and cook over low heat until sugar is
  dissolved. Raise heat to medium-high and cook, stirring frequently
  and skimming off the foam as it rises, until temperature reaches
  220F, about 1/2 hour. Remove marmalade from heat.
  
  To test for consistency, drop a little marmalade on a saucer and put
  the saucer into the freezer until marmalade is cold, about 5 minutes.
  Tip the saucer: the marmalade should just barely run. If too thin,
  return the marmalade to medium-high heat and cook, testing often,
  until it has reached the right consistency.
  
  Put marmalade into hot, sterilized pint or half-pint jars. Store in
  refrigerator up to 1 month or, for longer storage, seal according to
  reliable canning instructions.

 Categories: 
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Large egg whites-(11 to 12)
      1 tb Cold water
      1 c  Sifted cake flour
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Cream of tartar
      1 c  Granulated sugar
      1 ts Vanilla
      2 ts Finely grated lemon zest
           Filling:
      2 lg Eggs
      3    Egg yolks
    1/2 c  Sugar
      6 tb Strained lemon juice -- (2
           Lemons)
      1 tb Finely grated lemon zest
      3 oz Unsalted butter -- (6
           Tablespoons)
           Chilled and cut into 6
           Pieces
           Meringue Frosting:
    1/4 c  Water
    2/3 c  Sugar
    1/3 c  Large egg whites -- (about
      3    )
    1/8 ts Cream of tartar
      2 tb Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla
 
  Place fresh, cold egg whites and cold water in the bowl of a heavyduty
  mixer. Set aside until they are 60 degrees, or slightly below room
  temperature. Pour flour, 1/2 cup granulated sugar and salt into a
  triple sifter or sieve. Sift onto a sheet of waxed paper; set aside.
  Adjust rack in lower third of oven; preheat oven to 325 degrees. Set
  nearby a dry, ungreased 10inch tube pan. Such a pan allows the batter
  to cling to the sides and rise to its full height. Place a longnecked
  bottle or large metal funnel nearby for inverting the baked cake.
  Whip egg whites, preferably with a whisk attachment until frothy. Add
  cream of tartar and whip on medium speed until soft peaks form.
  Continue whipping and gradually add the 1 cup granulated sugar until
  whites have thickened and form soft droopy white peaks. Add the
  vanilla and lemon zest in the final moments of whipping. Sprinkle
  onequarter of the flour mixture over the whites, and with a rubber
  spatula, fold into the whites. Repeat this process with the remaining
  flour mixture, folding in only onequarter of the flour mixture at a
  time. Gently pour the batter into an ungreased tube pan. Bake for 45
  to 50 minutes, or until the top is light golden, the cake feels
  spongy and springs back when touched, and a wooden toothpick inserted
  in the middle comes out free of cake. Invert cake onto the neck of a
  bottle or funnel. Cool completely before removing from pan. To remove
  cake from the pan, slip just the tip of a small metal spatula between
  the cake and pan. Slowly trace the perimeter to release any cake
  sticking to the pan. Tilt the cake pan on its side, and gently tap
  the bottom against the counter to loosen the cake. Rotate the cake
  pan, tapping as you turn it a few more times, until it appears free.
  Cover the cake with a rack or cardboard round, and atthe same time
  that you invert the cake onto the work surface, tap it firmly onto
  the surface. Lift the pan from the cake. Yield: one 10inch round cake
  For the filling: In a 1 1/2 quart heavybottomed saucepan, whisk
  briefly to combine the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, lemon juice, and lemon
  zest. Add the pieces of butter, and place the saucepan over medium
  heat, stirring constantly over the entire bottom. Cook the mixture
  without boiling until it begins to developbody and thicken. Remove
  from heat and pour through a stainless steel sieve into a bowl. Cover
  the surface with plastic wrap, poke a few small slits in the plastic
  with the tip of a paring blade allowing steam to escape while
  cooling. Refrigerate (curd will thicken). For the frosting: In a 3cup
  saucepan, combine the water and 2/3 cup sugar. Place over low heat to
  dissolve the sugar, then increase the heat to medium high and boil,
  without stirring, until a candy thermometer reads 235 degrees. (Wash
  down any sugar crystals slinging to the sides of the pan with a brush
  dipped in cold water.) Near the end of the boiling time, whip the egg
  whites with the cream of tartaruntil soft peaks form. Add the 2
  tablespoons sugar, and continue to whip until the whites are stiff
  butnot dry. With the mixer running, pour the syrup onto the whipped
  whites. Continue to whip onmedium speed, about 3 minutes more.
  Mixture will thicken, cool and form glossy, stiff peaks. Addthe
  vanilla. Cool to room temperature, about 8 to 10 minutes, then frost
  cake right away. Assembling the dessert: Cut cake into three layers.
  Spread the lemon filling equally between the two layers; top with
  remaining layer. Frost top and sides of cake with Italian Meringue
  Frosting.

      3    Egg whites, at room
           -temperature
    1/4 ts Cream of tartar
      6 tb Granulated sugar
      1 tb Grated lemon zest
 
  With electric mixer, beat whites until foamy. Add cream of tartar,
  and beat on high speed until soft peaks form. Beat in sugar, 1
  tablespoon at a time; continue beating until stiff and shiny peaks
  form. Gently fold in lemon zest. Drop mixture by heaping tablespoons
  onto 2 buttered and floured baking sheets. Bake in preheated 250
  degree oven 1 hour. Turn off oven; do not open oven door. Leave
  cookies undisturbed, in oven for 1 hour. Then transfer to wire racks
  to cool completely. Store in a tightly covered container.
  
  Note: Recipe can be doubled or tripled if you save egg whites in the
  freezer, like I do; just defrost and bring to room temperature before
  using. Like most meringue recipes, you need a low humidity day and
  utensils that are free from any fat residue, to be successful. Any
  citrus zest will work fine to vary the flavor. by Lori Longbotham,

      Title: LEMON MINT LAMB CHOPS
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8    Loin lamb chops
      3 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 tb Chopped fresh mint (or 1/2
           -tsp dried)
           LEMON MINT BUTTER:
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter, at room
           -temperature
      2 tb Lemon juice
      1 tb Chopped fresh mint (or 1/2
           -tsp. dried)
           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper to taste
 
  Trim excess fat off the lamb chops.  Combine the lemon juice, salt,
  olive oil, mint and pepper.  Marinate the lamb in this mixture in a
  flat dish, turning often, for at least 30 minutes at room temperature
  or longer in the refrigerator.
  
  While lamb is marinating, prepare the compound butter. Cream the
  butter with the lemon juice, mint and salt and pepper to taste. Place
  the butter on a piece of waxed paper and shape into a cylinder about
  3 x 1 1/2 inches. Refrigerate.
  
  Broil, barbecue or pan fry the lamb chops approximately 3 to 5
  minutes on each side (they should be slightly rare). Slice the butter
  thinly and place two slices on each hot chop.  The butter will melt
  slowly and moisten and flavour the lamb.  Lower-fat Version: Use only
  a very thin slice of the lemon butter, or omit it entirely. Yield: 4

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Sprig fresh spearmint (4-6
           -leaves)
    1/2 c  Lemon juice
      1 c  Sugar
      3 c  Half & half
 
  Measure everything but 2 cups of the milk into blender. Blend until
  sugar is dissolved. Add remaining milk and blend a few seconds to
  mix. Pour in to 1 quart freezer and freeze according to directions.
  (I use a Donvier.) I find that adults like this flavor and today's
  kids hate it. I used to use an egg in it, till the salmonella and
  cholesterol scares. I find I don't miss it.
  
  When you make it, think of my poor grandmother, in the 1920's heating
  up a goatsmilk lemon custard, trying hard to keep it from curdling,
  hand-chopping the mint, and then turning the ice cream maker over to
  4 sons to crank. She was an ex-missionary nurse and a heck of lady,
  named Flossie Pease.

 Categories: Breads, Low-fat
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Flour, unbleached white
      1 c  Skim milk; at room temp
      1 tb Olive oil, extra virgin
    1/4 ts Salt; or to taste
    1/2 ts Black pepper;coarsely ground
           -or cracked
      2 ts Lemon rind; freshly grated
      3 ea Egg whites;lightly beaten
 
  *Anne's note:I'd omit the salt to reduce the sodium
  
  "These delicious popovers take advantage of lemon's strong affinity
  with freshly ground black pepper. They rise best in baked in deep
  molds in a very hot oven. One of the best ways to grate lemon peel is
  to remove the zest in strips using a vegetable peeler, then grind it
  to a powder in a spice mill."
  
  Preheat oven to 450F. Sift the flour into a mixing bowl and gradually
  whisk in the milk. Add the remaining ingredients, whisking just to
  mix. The mixture should be the consistency of heavy cream. If
  necessary, add more milk. Grease popover molds or muffin cups with
  vegetable oil spray or a little olive oil. Fill each mold 1/2 full.
  Bake for 15 minutes without opening the door. Reduce heat to 375F and
  continue baking for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the popovers are
  browned. Unmold and serve at once.

  This cake is remarkable; no one would ever believe that it is so low
  in fat and calories. Depending on the sweetness of the fruit you use
  to garnish the cake, you may wish to increase or decrease the sugar
  in the lemon syrup. (By Times Food Stylists)
  
  Combine nonfat milk and poppy seeds in a bowl. Let stand about 15
  minutes. Stir in pear puree, egg white, vanilla and lemon zest. Sift
  together cake flour, 3/4 cup sugar and baking powder in another bowl.
  Stir nonfat milk mixture just until blended. Pour into 9-inch
  indented, fluted shortcake pan sprayed with non-stick vegetable
  spray. Bake at 375 degrees F. about 20 minutes or until cake tests
  done in the center. Let cool in pan 5 minutes. Loosen edges and turn
  out onto wire rack with wax paper underneath. Combine remaining 1/4
  cup sugar and lemon juice in small sauce pan. Heat to boiling. Simmer
  about 1 minute or until syrup is clear. Brush syrup over top and
  sides of cake while cake is still warm. Place cake on serving
  platter. Arrange raspberries, kiwi wedges and papaya balls in
  attractive arrangement on top of cake. Garnish center with lemon rose

      Title: LEMON POPPYSEED
 Categories: Cakes, Desserts, Breads
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1    Box Yellow Cake mix*
      1    Instant Lemon pudding
      1 c  Water
      4    Eggs
           Poppyseed
    2/3 c  Vegetable oil
 
  *(I use Betty Crocker Supermoist) Beat all ingredients, except
  poppyseed, until smooth.
   Add poppyseed to your taste.  I usually add about 2 Tablespoons but
  you can add as much as you like.  I then bake it in a well greased
  bundt pan for about 40 minutes at 350 degrees or until a toothpick
  comes out clean. If you were using small bread pans you would cut the
  baking time down depending on the size of your pans. It makes great
  muffins too.

      Title: LEMON POPPYSEED MUFFIN
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/3 c  Cake flour
    1/2 ts Baking soda
      4 oz Butter
  1 1/3 c  Sugar
      4    Eggs
      3 tb Lemon juice
      3 ts Grated lemon peel
      2 ts Vanilla
      5 tb Poppy seeds
    1/2 c  Sour cream
 
  Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees.  Butter muffin tins for
       12    muffins.
  
  Sift the dry ingredients (flour and soda) and set aside. Cream the
  butter in a large bowl and add the sugar a little at a time, beating
  until light and fluffy; add the eggs one at a time, beating well,
  then add the lemon juice, vanilla, lemon peel and poppy seeds. Add
  the flour and sour cream to this making sure the batter is well mixed.
  
  Fill muffin tins about 3/4 full.  Bake for 20-25 minutes or until
  golden. Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve warm or cool on a
  cake rack.
  
  The original recipe calls for separating the eggs and whipping the egg
  whites separately with half the sugar. This meringue is then folded
  into the batter just before baking. This makes for a lighter muffin,
  but is unnecessary.

      Title: LEMON PRESSED CABBAGE
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Head savoy cabbage
      1    Handful (1*cup?) fresh cloud
           Ear mushroom (or
           Reconstituted dry, I
           Presume would be fine).
    1/2    Lemon
  1 1/2 ts Salt
 
  Remove rib from each leaf cabbage.  Chop leaves into 1 inch squares
  (approximately).  Chop mushrooms into 1/2 inch squares
  (approximately). Slice lemon very thin and quarter slices. Mix
  everything and press in pickle press for an hour or so.  Drain off
  liquid and serve.
  
  Nice, crunchy, refreshing, and good.
  
  Refering to the book, I see that the closest recipe looks even
  better: they use chinese cabbage instead of savoy, sliver the ribs
  and add them (duh), and add fresh ginger. Hmmm. Maybe next time. Oh,
  they used less mushroom (no don't do that).

    1/4 c  Sugar
 
  USING A GRATER, grate lemon peels, removing only the yellow part.
  Place the grated peel in a mixing bowl. Squeeze the lemon juice and
  set aside in a small bowl. Combine the butter, vanilla, sugar and
  salt in an electric mixer fitted with a paddle, if you have one, and
  beat together at medium speed until creamy. Add the egg, 1/2 cup
  lemon juice and grated rind and beat until incorporated. Reserve any
  extra lemon juice for another use. Decrease speed to slow and add the
  semolina and then the flour, beating until just incorporated. Turn
  the dough onto a marble or wooden work surface and divide it into 2
  balls. Wrap in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to chill
  for 1 hour. When chilled, remove from the refrigerator and roll each
  ball into a log 2-inches in diameter. PREHEAT OVEN TO 325F. Working
  on a marble or wooden surface, unwrap the dough log and cut into
  rounds about 1/2-inch thick. Sprinkle each round with a little sugar
  and lightly flatten the rounds with a rolling pin. Place the rounds
  on an unbuttered cookie sheet and chill in the refrigerator until
  firm, about 10 minutes. Bake the cookies on the middle rack of an
  oven for about 10 minutes, or until the surface starts to crack
  slightly. Remove from the oven and let cool. The cookies will be
  chewy at first, but will harden as they cool.

  grate the zest from the lemons, removing only the bright yellow
  portion of the peel. Set the lemons aside. Combine the zest, the
  water and 1/4 cup of the sugar in a small saucepan.  Stir over medium
  heat for about 2 minutes, just until the sugar dissolves. Add the
  butter and stir until melted, about 1 minute longer.  Set aside. With
  a sharp knife remove and discard all the remaining peel from the
  lemons. Cut the lemons crosswise into slices about 1/4 inch thick;
  discard any seeds.  You will need about 12 nicely shaped slices. Put
  about 1 teaspoon of the remaining sugar in the bottom of each
  prepared muffin cup and place a lemon slice on top. In a medium bowl,
  stir and toss together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and
  salt. Set aside. In a larger bowl whisk together the eggs, milk and
  the reserved lemon mixture until smooth.  Add the combined dry
  ingredients and stir just until blended. Spoon into the tins, filling
  about 3/4 full. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean, 15 - 20
  minutes. Immediately invert the tins; the muffins should fall out. If
  they resist, nudge them with a knife. * Makes about 12 standard

 Categories: Holidays, Desserts, Cakes
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------LEMON FILLING----------------------------
      1 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Water
      4 lg Egg yolks, lightly beaten
      2 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Lemon juice
      1 tb Finely grated lemon rind

MMMMM------------------------CAKE LAYERS-----------------------------
  3 1/2 c  Unsifted cake flour
      4 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Sugar
      1 c  (2 sticks) butter, softened
      1 tb Lemon juice
      1 ts Finely grated lemon rind
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 c  Milk
      7 lg Egg whites
           White-Chocolate Snowflakes
           -and Frosting
      4    3-oz bars white chocolate,
           -coarsely chopped
           Silver dragees (opt.)
      1    1/2 8-oz packages cream
           -cheese, softened
    1/2 c  (1 stick) butter,
           -softened
      1 tb Lemon juice
 
  White-chocolate snowflakes balance gracefully on a delicate, lemony
  three-layer white cake filled with zesty lemon custard and covered
  with a white-chocolate frosting.
  
  1. Several hours or day before serving, prepare Lemon Filling: In
  2-quart saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch, and salt until well
  mixed. Gradually add water, stirring until smooth. Heat mixture to
  boiling over medium heat, stirring constantly with wire whisk; boil 1
  minute (or until mixture thickens). In small bowl, quickly stir some
  of hot mixture into egg yolks, then stir egg-yolk mixture into
  remaining hot mixture in saucepan until well blended. Reduce heat to
  low; add butter and cook mixture for 5 minutes, stirring
  occasionally. Remove from heat; stir in lemon juice and rind. Cool to
  room temperature; cover surface of filling with plastic wrap and
  refrigerate until filling is completely cold-at least 2 hours.
  
  2. Prepare Cake Layers: Heat oven to 375'F. Grease three 9-inch-round
  baking pans.  Line bottoms of pans with parchment or, waxed paper;
  grease and flour paper. In medium-size bowl, combine flour, baking
  powder, and salt.
  
  3. In large bowl, with electric mixer at medium speed, beat 1 3/4 C
  sugar and very light and fluffy; beat in lemon juice, lemon rind, and
  vanilla. Add flour mixture alternately with milk to butter mixture,
  beginning and ending with flour mixture, beating until smooth batter
  forms.
  
  4. In another bowl, with clean beaters and mixer at high speed, beat
  egg whites and remaining 1/4 C sugar until stiff peaks form. With
  rubber spatula, gently fold egg whites into batter. Divide evenly
  among prepared pans.
  
  5. Bake 25 minutes, or until cake tester inserted in center comes out
  clean. Cool cake layers in pans on wire racks 10 minutes; invert
  layers onto wire racks, remove parchment paper and cool layers
  completely.
  
  6. Meanwhile, prepare White-Chocolate Snowflakes: In double boiler,
  over hot, not boiling, water, or in microwave, melt 1 1/2 bars white
  chocolate. Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spoon melted
  white chocolate into pastry bag fitted with writing tip. Reserve pan
  in which white chocolate was melted. Onto foil-lined sheet, pipe
  twenty-eight 2-inch snowflakes. Decorate with silver dragees, if
  desired. Place sheet of snowflakes in freezer until cake is
  completely frosted.
  
  7. Prepare White-Chocolate Frosting: Melt remaining 2 1/2 bars white
  chocolate in the same pan; set aside to cool to room temperature. In
  large bowl, with electric mixer at medium speed, beat cream cheese
  until smooth. Gradually beat in white chocolate, butter, and lemon
  juice until frosting is smooth.
  
  8. To assemble cake, with sharp knife, trim tops of cake layers to
  make level. Place one cake layer on serving plate; spread with half
  of lemon filling; repeat with second cake layer and filling. Place
  last cake layer, upside down, on top of filling to complete 3-layer
  cake. Frost cake smoothly with White-Chocolate Frosting. Remove
  snowflakes from freezer; gently peel snowflakes from foil. Press a
  few snowflakes into side of cake; pile remaining on top of cake.
  Serve immediately or store in refrigerator.

      Title: LEMON SORBET
 Categories: Desserts, Fruits
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Peel of 1 lemon, diced small
      1 c  Water
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Lemon juice
    1/2 c  Mineral water
           Lemon peel twists to garnish
 
  Make a syrup by combining the finely diced lemon peel with the water
  & the sugar in a non-corrosive pan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat &
  simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat & let cool. Combine the
  syrup with the lemon juice & the mineral water.
  
  At this point, use one of two steps.  Either use an ice cream maker &
  follow the maunfacturers instructions. Or, place in a tall canister &
  put in the freezer. Freeze for 1 1/2 hours. Remove, stir & beat
  briefly with a whisk.  Return to the freezer & repeat the beating
  process after another 50 minutes. You may have to repeat this three
  or four times. The more you beat your sorbet, the more air is being
  incorporated & hence the lighter the finished product. Keep in the
  freezer above your fridge rather than a deep freeze otherwise you'll
  get a finished product that is hard. If you only have a deep freeze,
  place sorbet in fridge for 1 to 2 hours before serving.
  
  Will keep for 3 or 4 days.
  
  NOTE: The author from whom I adapted this recipe suggested that you
  do not use a deep freeze or any free standing when making sorbets
  because the temperatures are too cold.  However, I have had no
  success making a sorbet from scratch in a fridge-freezer. I use my
  chest freezer & mix more often than is called for.  When the sorbet
  is ready, then I transfer it to the fridge freezer for keeping it.
