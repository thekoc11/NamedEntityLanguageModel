batter. 12 MUFFINS.

     1/2  teaspoon      vanilla
   4      teaspoons     milk -- approximately

Grease a 12-inch pizza pan; set aside. Flatten thawed dough slightly on a lightly floured surface. Cut each loaf into four pieces. Form each piece into a rope about 18 inches long. Brush each rope lightly on all sides with melted margarine.

Stir together granulated sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Place in a shallow pan or on a large sheet of foil.

Roll one rope in sugar mixture to coat evenly. Shape rope into a coil in the center of the prepared pizza pan. Roll another rope in sugar. Attach securely to end of first rope and coil around first coil. Continue coating ropes with sugar and attaching to form a 10 to 11-inch circle. Sprinkle any remaining sugar mixture over coil. Sprinkle the chopped pecans on top.

Cover with plastic wrap and let rise overnight in refrigerator. Remove from refrigerator and let stand 15 to 20 minutes before baking. (Or, cover and let rise in a warm place 30 to 40 minutes or till nearly double.)

Bake in a 350°F oven for 30 to 35 minutes or till done. Cover with foil for the last 10 minutes, if necessary, to prevent over-browning. Cool about 15 minutes. Transfer to serving plate. Drizzle with Powdered Sugar Icing. Decorate plate with cinnamon sticks and pecan halves, if desired. Serve warm.

Makes 16 servings.

Powdered Sugar Icing: Stir together 1 1/4 cups sifted powdered sugar, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, and enough milk (about 4 teaspoons) to make a frosting.
