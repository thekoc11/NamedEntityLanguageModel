Paper Bag Apple Pie

pies, pastries

1  method only

Prepare and set aside one unbaked pie shell.

Pare and core about 8 cooking apples.  Cut into quarters and cut these in
half (not 1/8).  Place in a large bowl and set aside.

Combine and mix well: 1/2 C. sugar, 2 T. flour, 1/2 t. cinnamon (the
original recipe calls for nutmeg, but my family prefers cinnamon). Sprinkle
over apple chunks and toss slightly.  Spoon into prepared shell. Sprinkle
over top: 2 T. lemon juice.

Combine in bowl: 1/2 C. sugar, 1/2 C. flour.  Mix well and add 1/2 C butter
or margarine.  Cut in butter with a pastry blender or two knives until
mixture is coarse, like cornmeal.  Sprinkle this mixture evenly over top of
pie.

Slide pie into a large, heavy supermarket paper bag.  Fold open end twice
and fasten with paper clips.  Place on a baking sheet.  Bake at 425 for 1
hour.  Remove from oven, split bag open and cool pie on wire rack. DO NOT
open bag while baking! This is a great pie and one that friends always
request from me. Enjoy!

      ----PIEROGI FILLING----
1 1/2 lb parsnips, peeled
2  shallots, peeled
1 teaspoon unsalted butter
1  freshly grated nutmeg
1  salt & freshly ground pepper
2 teaspoon freshly grated or prepared horserad; ish
4 oz farmer cheese or goat cheese
      ----SAUTEED APPLES----
2 teaspoon unsalted butter
2  apples, peeled if desired, cored, a; nd thinly sliced
3 teaspoon sugar

1. To make red-cabbage slaw, whisk together vinegar, sugar, and
caraway seeds in a medium bowl. Toss in cabbage. Season with salt and
pepper. Let marinate for at least i hour, or up to overnight.

2. To make pierogi dough, whisk together egg, milk, sour cream, and
water. Stir in flour a little at a time until dough comes together.
Turn out onto a lightly floured board and knead until smooth and
elastic, up to 10 minutes. Incorporate more flour if dough is too
sticky. Cover dough with plastic wrap and allow to rest for 1 hour.

3. To make filling, place parsnips in a medium saucepan and cover with
cold, salted water. Bring to a boil and simmer until tender, 20 to 25
minutes. Drain and put through a food mill to puree.

4. In a small saute pan, cook shallots in butter until soft, 1 to 2
minutes. Stir into puree and add nutmeg, salt, and pepper to taste.
Remove from heat and let cool slightly then mix in horseradish and
cheese.

5. On a lightly floured board, roll out dough to 1/8 inch. Cut out
circles using a 3/4-inch-round cutter. Set circles aside on a floured
tray. Place a round T of filling on each circle. Lightly wet edges,
fold over, and seal by pinching.

6. To make sauteed apples, heat a medium saute pan over medium-high
heat. Melt butter, add apple slices, and toss to coat. Add sugar and
toss again to coat evenly. Cook until brown, about 5 minutes.

7. When ready to serve, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add
pierogies and boil for 5 minutes after they float to the surface;
drain. Pierogies can be eaten right away or browned in a small amount
of butter. Serve with red-cabbage slaw and sauteed apples.

Pate A La Rapture  <Rappie Pie>

pies, canadian, chicken, historical

1  peck potatoes
2  chickens (3 or 3 1/2 lbs
1  each)
3 large onions
1/4 lb butter
6  strips bacon
1  salt & pepper to taste
1  poultry seasoning

You will need a grater, a large pan (17"x12"x2"), and a sturdy cloth
bag. Simmer the chickens in a pot on top of the stove with plenty of
onions and seasonings. When cooked, separate the meat from the bones
and chop meat into pieces.  Save the broth.

Meanwhile, peel the potatoes and soak in cold water. Grate about 10
potatoes at a time and then place them in a cloth bag.  Squeeze
tightly until all the water and starch is removed.  Do all the
potatoes this way.

Save the liquid from the potatoes: measure it. You must measure an
equal amount of chicken broth to replace the potato water. When the
potatoes are all squeezed, loosen them in a large pan and gradually
add the measured chicken broth, stirring slowly. The potatoes may
take on a jelly-like appearance. Be sure there are no lumps. Add
seasonings and stir, stir, stir!

Cover the bottom of a well-greased pan with half the potato mixture.
Arrange chicken pieces, chopped onion, and pats of butter on top.
Cover with the other half of the potato mixture.  Then add a bit of
chopped onion, more pats of butter and six strips of bacon. This will
form the crust.  Place pie in a hot (400F) oven for about 2 hours, or
until a brown crust is formed.

Delicious with applesauce or cranberry sauce.

Serves 12.

here is my all time favorite pie, it is rich but sooo fabulous

Ann's chocolate pie
6 oz choc chips              1 tea lemon juice
1/4 cup cornstarch           1 cup whipping cream
1/4 cup water                1 cup butter (must be butter not marg)
1/2 cup sugar                4 tbl sugar
1/4 cup (again) water        2 cups flour
1   eggwhite
1 tea vanilla

(can be made in a pie shell but I have best results in a spring release
pan)
First prepare crust,Mix butter and 4 tbl of sugar together and add flour ,
mix
until crumbly (about 3 mins on med) pat 2/3 of mixture into pie pan or
spring
pan and put remainder into a small pan and heat both at 350 for about
15mins
(or until light brown)  stir the small pan amount once during cooking time
to
create crumbs
Once done put in refrigerater to cool completely

Melt choc in cornsyrup and 1/4 cup of water ( Can be done over low heat or
in
the microwave 4mins on med) stir to incorporate and put in refrigerater to
cool completely

Combine 1/2 c of sugar, 1/4 c water, egg white, vanilla  and lemon juice ,
beat on high speed until peeks form (this takes a long time about 20
minutes
with my mixer).  In a seperate bowl beat one cup of whipping cream until
thick. Fold cream and half of the chocolate mixture into the eggwhite mix.
Spoon into shell. Drizzle other half of the chocolate over filling and cut
throughout with knife. Sprinkle crumbs over top and cool until firm (about
two
hours)

Peach & Sour Cream Tart

pies, fruits/nuts

      ----SWEET PASTRY DOUGH----
1 cup flour
1/4 cup sugar
1 pinch salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
4 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 large egg
      ----POACHED PEACHES----
3 lb ripe peaches
1/2 cup sugar
      ----SOUR CREAM FILLING----
1/2 cup sour cream
1/3 cup sugar
3 large eggs
1 pinch nutmeg
1/2 cup blanched, sliced almonds
1  confectioners' sugar  for finishing

FOR THE DOUGH: COMBINE DRY INGREDIENTS in bowl of food processor and
pulse several times to mix. Cut butter into 8 pieces and distribute
evenly over dry ingredients in work bowl. Pulse until very finely
powdered. Add egg and continue to pulse until dough forms a ball that
revolves on blade. Remove dough, press into a disk, wrap and chill.
TO POACH THE PEACHES: CUT A CROSS IN THE BLOSSOM end of each peach
and immerse in boiling water about 30 seconds. Remove peaches to a
bowl of ice water and slip off skins after they cool. Cut each peach
into eight wedges, cutting them away from the pit as they are
removed. Arrange slices in a wide, shallow non-reactive pan in one
layer and sprinkle with sugar. Cover and place over low heat and
bring to a simmer. Remove from heat. Cool. Drain peaches gently by
lifting them from the juices with a slotted spoon to a plate or other
non-reactive surface. Reserve the juices for another use. SOUR CREAM
FILLING: PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350F and set a rack in the lower third.
Roll the pastry dough on a floured surface and line a 10-inch tart
pan with it. Arrange the peach wedges on their sides in a concentric
pattern. Whisk the filling ingredients together, strain and skim foam
from top. Pour filling over peaches and sprinkle evenly with the
sliced almonds. Bake the tart about 40 minutes, until the crust is
baked through and the filling has set. Cool on a rack. Unmold, and
serve at room temperature. Dust with the confectioners' sugar
immediately before serving. Store leftovers refrigerated.

1 cup raspberries
3 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 pinch nutmeg
2 tablespoon butter  - -  - -  - -
1 teaspoon milk

1.  Preheat oven to 425 F.  Slice peaches into 1/2-inch-thick wedges.

pastry with water.  Place 10-inch circle of pastry over filling.
Gently press seams together to seal. Trim dough to 1/2 inch beyond
tim of plate. Then turn edge underneath and flute rim. Cut 2 or 3
(2-inch) slits on top crust to allow steam to escape.

small bowl.  Brush evenly over pie crust. Place pie on bottom rack of
preheated 425 F oven. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until pastry

Peach Pie Filling

fruits, pies, canning

      ----FOR 1 QUART FILLING----
3 1/2 cup sliced fresh peaches
1 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup clear jel(tm); plus...
1 tablespoon clear jel(tm)
3/4 cup cold water
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)
1/8 teaspoon almond extract (opt.)
1/4 cup bottled lemon juice
      ----FOR 7 QUARTS FILLING----
6 quart sliced fresh peaches
7 cup granulated sugar
2 cup clear jel(tm); plus...
3 tablespoon clear jel(tm)
5 1/4 cup cold water
1 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)
1 teaspoon almond extract (opt.)
1 3/4 cup bottled lemon juice

Quality: Select ripe, but firm fresh peaches. Red Haven, Redskin, Sun
High, and other varieties of similar quality are suitable.

Yield: 1 quart or 7 quarts.

Procedure: Peel peaches. To loosen skins, submerge peaches in boiling
water for approximately 30-60 seconds, and then place in cold water
for 20 seconds. Slip off skins and prepare slices 1/2-inch thick.
Place slices in water containing 1/2 tsp. of ascorbic acid crystals
or six 500-milligram vitamin C tablets in 1 gallon of water to
prevent browning. For fresh fruit, place 6 cups at a time in 1 gallon
boiling water. Boil each batch 1 minute after the water returns to a
boil. Drain but keep heated fruit in a covered bowl or pot. Combine
water, sugar, Clear Jel(tm), and, if desired, cinnamon and/or almond
extract in a large kettle. Stir and cook over medium high heat until
mixture thickens and begins to bubble. Add lemon juice and boil sauce
1 minute more, stirring constantly. Fold in drained peach slices and
continue to heat mixture for 3 minutes. Fill jars without delay,
leaving 1 inch head-space. Adjust lids and process immediately.

Peanut Butter Meringue Cream Pie

pies, pastries

1  9 inch pie shell; baked
2 1/2 cup milk; scalded
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup flour, all-purpose
1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
2  egg yolks; beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup peanut butter
1  meringue:
3 large egg whites; room temp
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
6 tablespoon superfine sugar

Prepare the prebaked pie shell; cool completely.  In the top of a double
boiler set over simmering water, combine 1/2 cup of the hot milk with the
sugar and flour. Add 1 1/2 cups of hot milk to the mixture in the double
boiler and cook, stirring frequently, for 20 minutes or until thickened.
Stir a small amount of the hot custard into the egg yolks. Combine the egg
yolk mixture with the mixture in the double boiler. Cook for 2 minutes
more.  Remove the pan from the heat. Add the vanilla. Beat the peanut
butter with the remaining milk. Add the peanut butter mixture to the hot
custard. Turn the filling into the pie shell. Preheat the oven to 350
degrees. While the filling is still hot, prepare the meringue. Beat the egg
whites, vanilla, and cream of tartar until the mixture holds stiff peaks.
Gradually add the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until very stiff
and glossy. All the sugar must be dissolved. Spread the meringue over the
hot filling, sealing it to the edge of the crust. Bake 12 to 15 minutes or
until golden brown. Cool, and chill until serving.

Peanut Butter Pie With Fudge Topping

pies, pastries, deserts

1  crust:
1 cup graham cracker crumbs
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup unsalted butter; cut into 1/
1  filling:
8 oz cream cheese; softened
1 cup creamy peanut butter
1 cup powdered sugar
2 tablespoon unsalted butter; softened
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup heavy cream; well chilled
1  fudge topping:
1/2 cup heavy cream
6 oz semisweet chocolate; chopped

Recipe by: Classic Home Desserts Preheat the oven to 350. In a medium bowl,
combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar and butter until well blended.
Press evenly into a buttered 9" pie pan, reaching up to but not over the
rim.  Bake until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Cool the crust
completely on a wire rack. Beat the cream cheese and peanut butter with an
electric mixer at medium speed until well blended. Add the powdered sugar,
butter and vanilla and continue beating until fluffy. Whip the cream until
not quite stiff. Fold a large spoonful of the whipped cream into the peanut
butter mixture to lighten it; gently fold in the remainder. Carefully spoon
the filling into the cooled crust, spreading evenly. Loosely cover the pie
and refrigerate until firm, about 3 hours. (You can put it in the freezer,
if you'd like to speed it up.) Bring the cream to a simmer in a small,
heavy saucepan. Add the chocolate and stir until smooth. Set aside to cool
to lukewarm. Gently spread the topping over the cooled pie. Refrigerate
until firm, about 3 hours. Serve cold.

the flour mixture to form a soft dough.  Add more water if necessary. Knead
briefly and press the dough over the bottom and sides of a buttered loose
bottomed 10-inch quiche pan.  Trim the edges. Line the pastry with aluminum
foil and weight with rice or beans. Bake 10 minutes. Remove foil and rice
or beans; bake until the pastry is golden, 5 to 10 minutes. Cool on a rack.

To make the caramel:  Combine 1/3 cup of sugar with 2 tablespoons water in
a medium skillet.  Heat to boiling and boil until the mixture turns a light
caramel color.  Carefully, but quickly, brush the caramel over the bottom
and sides of the pastry shell.

To make filling:  Peel 6 of the pears, cut in half, and remove the cores.
Cut each half into 4 slices.  Place the pears in a large heavy skillet or
saucepan.  combine 2/3 cup sugar, the ginger, and 1 cup water and pour over
the pears.  Heat to boiling; reduce the heat. Simmer, covered, until pears
are soft but not mushy, 6-8 minutes, depending on ripeness of pears. Cool.

Drain the pears, reserving the liquid.  Arrange the pears over the bottom
of the pastry shell.

Peel the remaining pears, cut into quarters, and remove the cores. Cut
each quarter into thin slices.  Arange symmetrically over the cooked pears.

Combine the apricot preserves with 4 tablespoons of the pear liquid in a
small saucepan.  Heat to boiling; strain.

Brush the tart with half the apricot mixture.  Bake 30 minutes. Remove
from oven and brush with the remaining apricot mixture.  Serve slightly
warmed with whipped cream if desired. Source: Bert Greene in "Christmas

Pecan Tarts

pies, pastries, deserts, holiday

      ----PASTRY----
6 oz cream cheese
1/2 lb butter (or margarine)
2 cup flour, all-purpose
      ----FILLING----
3 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup pecans, chopped
4  eggs, beaten
4 tablespoon butter (or margarine), melted

Allow the butter and cream cheese to soften.  Mix cream cheese and butter
with a mixer until fluffy. Then (using your hands) mix in the flour.
Separate mixture into four equal parts and flatten each into a rectangular
shape. Allow the pastry to chill for several hours.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Prepare filling by mixing all ingredients
gently.  Use a spoon, not a mixer.  Refrigerate until muffin tins are ready
to fill.

Take one unit of the chilled pastry and cut into 12 equal pieces. Roll each
piece into a ball and then form the ball into the muffin tin in the shape
of a crust. Fill each tart about 3/4 full. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 20 to
30 minutes.

Bake these until slightly brown.  To remove tarts, just turn the tin upside
down onto paper towels and then turn the tart right side up on a baking
rack to cool.

NOTES:

*  Miniature pecan pies cooked in bite-size individual crusts in tiny
muffin tins -- They are quite delicious.

*  You will need to purchase tiny muffin tins, sometimes called "nugget
pans," to make these tarts. They are inexpensive and you can use these for
various other things. It is best to purchase enough to make four dozen at
once. The entire four dozen will fit into the oven on one rack! It is best
to spray these tins with cooking oil before putting the crust in.

*  There is a wooden utensil called a "tart-tamper" that is a real
time-saver for this recipe. It might be difficult to find. It is used to
smash the ball to fit the tin so you don't spend a lot of time using your
fingers.  You dip the tip of the tamper in flour each time to prevent
sticking to the pastry. It also makes the pastry look much more uniform and
professional.

: Difficulty:  easy if you have a tart tamper; moderate otherwise.
: Time:  15 minutes pastry preparation; several hours chilling; 1 hour
filling, baking and cooling.
: Precision:  Be precise for the pastry, filling may be approximate.

Pecan Tassies

pies, cheese

      ----PASTRY DOUGH----
8 tablespoon butter, softened
3 oz cream cheese, softened
1 cup sifted a-p soft wheat flour
      ----FILLING----
2/3 cup chopped pecans
1  egg
3/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon butter, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/8 teaspoon salt

Prehead oven to 325F.  Mix together the butter and cream cheese in a
small bowl or food processor.  Add the flour and blend thoroughly.
Divide and shape into 30 balls. Wrap all 30 balls together in plastic
wrap and chill slightly.  Place each ball in a tiny ungreased fluted
tart pan or muffin cup.  Line the pans by pressing the dough with
your fingertips against the bottoms and sides. For the filling, place
half the pecans in the dough-lined pan.  Beat together the egg,
sugar, butter, vanilla, sand salt until all lumps are gone. Pour the
egg mixture onto the pecan topped dough. Dot with the remaining
pecans. Bake for 25 minutes or until the filling is set.  Cool 5
minutes on a rack and remove from the pans before they are cool, as
the caramel will set. These tiny tarts freeze easily.

Persimmon Cream Pie

fruits, pies

1  10-inch buttery pie crust
      ----FILLING----
1 1/2 cup persimmon pulp; (5-6 fruits)
1 1/2 cup cream
2 tablespoon flour
1 cup sugar
2 tablespoon unsalted butter; melted
4  egg yolks
1  egg; whole
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
      ----STICKY PECAN PRALINE CRUMBLE---
2 cup pecan halves or pieces
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup water
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar

For best results, persimmons must be riper than you think they are.
They ripen best at room temperature, points up -- no bags, no
ripening bowls. When they look rotten, shriveled, and feel like
there's jelly under their skins, they're ready. This can take weeks.

PERSIMMON FILLING: Set oven rack in the center of the oven and
preheat oven to 450'F. Scoop persimmon pulp out of skins, discarding
seeds and leaves. Puree pulp in a food processor or blender.

Whisk together cream, flour, sugar, and melted butter. Beat together
the yolks, the whole egg, and the vanilla and whisk into cream
mixture. Fold in persimmon pulp. Pour filling into pie shell. Top
with a handful (about 1/2 cup) of praline crumble.

Bake 10 minutes at 450'F. Reduce heat to 350'F and bake 50 minutes to
1 hour more. Rotate pie if crust begins to overbrown, or cover rim
with a foil strip. Filling will nearly boil when done.

FOR STICKY PECAN PRALINE CRUMBLE: Toast pecans on a cookie sheet at
350'F about 10 to 15 minutes, tossing them a few times. (Nuts will
start to smell toasted when they need to come out of the oven.)
Butter another cookie sheet and set aside.

In a heavy saucepan, bring sugar, water, and cream of tartar to a
boil over medium-high heat. (If crystals form on the sides of the
pan, cover the pan for 30 seconds or as long as 5 minutes so steam
rinses off the sides.) When the sugar darkens, you may swirl the pan
to even the color. As caramel turns the color of light hay, remove
from heat. Don't let the caramel get too dark, or the sugar will be
too brittle to crumble, and it will snap instead.

Using a wooden spoon, stir in toasted nuts, mixing to coat them very
well. Spread caramel-coated nuts out on the buttered cookie sheet,
cool 1 hour, then chop coarsely with a knife (a food processor causes
the caramel to stick and clump).

You can store the surplus in a tightly covered jar at room
temperature for three months.

Persimmon Pie

fruits, pies, pastries, deserts

1  unbaked 9-inch pie crust
2 cup persimmon puree
1 tablespoon flour
1/3 cup honey
1 tablespoon sorghum
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1/8 teaspoon allspice
3 each eggs
1 cup evaporated milk

Brush crust with egg white from one of the eggs; set aside.  Mix persimmon
with flour, honey, sorghum and spices.  Beat in eggs and milk. Pour into
prepared pie crust.  Bake at 400F 40-50 minutes until pie doesn't jiggle
when shaken.  Cover edges with circle of foil if crust begins to brown too
much.

Native persimmons are so sweet that they have also been called wild figs or
sugar plums.  The English word persimmon is said to have come from the
Algonquin word pessemin.  Like apricots, persimmons contain ample amounts
of vitamins A and C.  The easiest way to get persimmon pulp is to puree
fully ripe persimmons using a food mill or a Chinaman sieve. Aluminum or
plastic sieves are best since iron or tin will turn the rosey orange pulp
dark.  Freeze any you don't use now for use later in winter and spring.
When ripe, persimmons are very soft and take on a dusty pale lavender cast.
Persimmon pulp can be used in any pumpkin recipe with similar results. It
marries well with cinnamon, nutmeg and orange. Since it is not as think as
pumpkin, adding a little flour to pie fillings is a good idea.

Pets De Soeurs (Sister's [i.E.~ Nun's] Farts)

pastries, french

6 tablespoon butter
2 teaspoon sugar
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon grated lemon rind
4  eggs
1 cup flour
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 teaspoon rum, dark; opt
1  oil; for deep-frying
1  sugar, confectioners

Combine the butter, sugar, salt, and lemon rind with 1 cup water in a
saucepan and bring the mixture slowly to a boil. When the butter has
completely melted, remove the pan from the heat. While the pan is
heating, break each of the eggs into a separate custard cup or
similar small dish and have these ready. When the pan is removed from
the heat, add all the flour at once, stirring, first carefully, then,
when the flour is absorbed, vigorously with a wooden spoon.

When you have a compact, thick paste, turn the heat to medium high and
return the pan to it.  Cook this mixture for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring
constantly and scraping the sides and bottom, until the batter clings
together in a solid mass, leaving the bottom and sides of the pan
clean, and takes on a glossy look.  Turn off the heat and remove the
pan from the stove.

Beat in the vanilla, and the rum if used, giving the batter a chance
to cool a little.  When it has, make a well in its center, pour in 1
egg, and beat this into the mass. When it is incorporated, beat in
another egg and proceed until all the eggs are used.  The resulting
pastry should be flexible and soft, firm enough to hold its shape and
not at all runny. Set it aside and let it rest for about 45 minutes,
or for the duration of supper.

When ready to make the fritters, fill a deep skillet or deep-fat fryer
two-thirds full of oil and heat to 360 deg.F (not too hot, or the
exteriors will brown before the center is cooked). If you are using a
deep-fat fryer, do not use the basket, but a slotted spoon or wire
mesh skimmer instead. Drop the batter into the hot oil a teaspoonful
at a time, dipping the spoon into the oil after each scoop.  Don't
overcrowd the pan, since they puff up to about four times their
original size. Nudge them to roll over, so that they color evenly on
all sides. When golden brown, drain on paper towels and sprinkle with
confectioners' sugar. Serve hot. Pet de Breton. This recipe makes 1
large fart. Make the batter with the same ingredients the same way as
explained above, including the 45- minute rest. Preheat oven to 375
deg.F.  Pour the batter into a large greased pan (a 10-inch or so
heavy cast-iron frying pan works well for this) and set in the oven.
Bake for an hour.  Remove, sprinkle with confectioners' sugar, tear
apart, and eat as soon as it's cool enough to handle.

Pie Fillings

pies, canning, info

1 x no ingredients

General: The following fruit fillings are excellent and safe
products. Each canned quart makes one 8-inch to 9-inch pie. The
filling may be used as toppings on dessert or pastries. "Clear
Jel(tm)" is a chemically modified corn starch that produces excellent
sauce consistency even after fillings are canned and baked. Other
available starches break down when used in these pie fillings,
causing a runny sauce consistency. Clear Jel(tm) is increasingly
available among canning and freezing supplies in some stores. If you
cannot find it, ask your county Extension home economist about its
availability in your region.

Because the variety of fruit may alter the flavor of the fruit pie,
it is suggested that you first make a single quart, make a pie with
it, and serve. Then adjust the sugar and spices in the recipe to suit
your personal preferences. The amount of lemon juice should not be
altered, as it aids in controlling the safety and storage stability
of the fillings.

When using frozen cherries and blueberries, select unsweetened fruit.
If sugar has been added, rinse it off while fruit is frozen. Thaw
fruit, then collect, measure, and use juice from fruit to partially
replace the water specified in the recipe.  Use only 1/4 cup Clear
Jel(tm) per quart, or 1-3/4 cups for 7 quarts. Use fresh fruit in the
apple and peach pie fillings.

Piemento Cheese

appetizers, pies, cheese

2 lb velveeta cheese
8 oz chopped piemento (4oz jars)
1 cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper

Drain piementos. Grate Velveeta cheese into a large bowl. Add
piementos, black pepper and red pepper to mayonnayse and mix well.
Add mayonnaise mixture to grated Velveeta cheese and mix well. Let
sit at room temp for about a half hour Store in refrigerator in a
sealed jar NOTES: Try it with Velveeta first...  Then substitute if
you must.. I find that the velveeta gives a better consistency...
Also, I recommend hand-grating... Food processors tend to liquify.
Sometimes I substitute 1 tsp ground mustard for the red pepper...
(Yup, I'm strange...) It's great on crackers or in sandwiches...
Also a great topping for burgers... And it keeps for -at least- a
month in the fridge!!!

Pineapple-Apricot Empanaditas

beverages, pies, deserts, cheese, fruits/nuts

      ----FILLING----
1 large ripe pineapple
1/2 cup good-quality apricot preserves
3 tablespoon sugar
3 tablespoon triple sec
1/4 cup fine dry bread crumbs,
1  (commerically prepared)
      ----PASTRY----
2 cup unbleached a-p flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
8 oz unsalted butter, slightly softened
6 oz cream cheese, slightly soft
      ----GLAZE----
1  egg, beated with 1t water
3 tablespoon sugar

With a serrated knife, remove the top from the pineapple. Quarter the
pineapple vertically and trim away the tough core from each quarter.
Cut the pineapple flesh away from the rind. Chop the pineapple; there
should be about 2 3/4 cups.  In a medium saucepan, combine the
pineapple, apricot jam, sugar, and Triple Sec. Set over medium heat
and bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, stirring often, until thick,
about 40 minutes. Cool to room temperature, and in a food processor
partially puree the pineapple mixture.  Some texture should remain.
Stir in the bread crumbs. (Filling can be prepared up to 2 days
ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)

In the work bowl of a food processor, combine the flour and salt and
pulse briefly to blend.  Add the butter and cream cheese and process
until a soft dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured
work surface and divide it in half.  Gather each half into a ball,
kneading briefly if necessary until smooth, and flatten each ball
into a 5-inch disk. Wrap the disks of dough separately in plastic and
refrigerate for at least 5 hours. (The dough can be prepared up to
2    days ahead.)

Let the discs of dough stand at room temperature until softened
slightly. Dust one disc of dough with flour and on a well-floured
surface roll it out to about 1/8-inch thick. Using a 3 1/2-inch
circular cutter, form the dough into about 12 rounds.  Lay the rounds
in a single layer on a plate or cookie sheet, wrap in plastic, and
return them to the refrigerator. Repeat with remaining dough.  (The
rounds of dough can be prepared 1 day ahead.)

Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat
the oven to 375F.  Lightly butter two large baking sheet pans.

Let the rounds of cream cheese pastry soften at room temperature just
until flexible.  Making one at a time, spread a heaping teaspoon of
pineapple filling across the center of each round, leaving a border.
Fold the round in half, then pinch the edges of the empanadita to
seal and crimp it decoratively.  Repeat with the remaining pastry
rounds and filling, transferring the completed empanaditas to the
baking sheets and spacing them well apart.  Brush each empanadita
with the egg wash and sprinkle it lightly with sugar. Bake the
emapanaditas, changing the position of the sheets on the racks from
top to bottom and from front to back at the halfway point, until they
are puffed, crisp, and golden, about 20 minutes. Cool them on a rack
before serving.  (The empanaditas can be prepared up to 1 day ahead
and stored, airtight, at room temperature.)

CRUST: Cut butter into small pieces and rub it into flour. Add a good
pinch of salt. Make a well in the centre; put in the egg and the
yeast dissolved in about 2 tablespoons tepid water. Mix and knead
until the dough comes away clean from the sides of the bowl. Shape
into a ball, make a deep cross-cut on the top, put on a floured
plate, cover with a floured cloth, and leave in a warm place to rise
for 2 hours. FILLING: Heat 3 or 4 tablespoons of olive oil in a heavy
fry-pan. Put in the onions and cook them very gently, with a cover on
the pan, until quite soft and a pale golden colour.  Add the tomatoes
and the seasonings (plus chopped garlic to taste, if desired) and
continue cooking until the onions and tomatoes have amalgamated, and
the moisture from the tomatoes has evaporated.

When the dough has risen; sprinkle it with flour and break it down
again. Knead once more into a ball and place in the centre of an
oiled 8-inch tart pan. Press the dough quickly but gently with your
knuckles outwards to the edge of the pan and up the rim.  Put in the
filling. Make a criss-cross lattice pattern with the anchovy fillets,
placing a halved olive in the centre of each opening in the lattice.
Leave it to rise for 15 minutes, then bake in the centre of an oven
preheated to 400 F for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 F and bake for
an additional 20 minutes.

Pizza Margherita E Pizza Napoletana

main dish, pies, italian

4 tablespoon active dry yeast
3 tablespoon salt
4 1/4 cup flour (all-purpose)
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 pinch sugar
5 tablespoon warm water
      ----TOPPING  NAPOLETANA PIZZA----
1  garlic, chopped
1  tomatoes, canned, peel/slice
1  anchovy fillets
1  oregano
1  salt
1  fresh ground black pepper
1  buffalo-milk mozzarella
      ----TOPPING  MARGHERITA PIZZA----
1  tomatoes, canned, peel/slice
1  salt
1  fresh ground black pepper
1  basil leaves, fresh, chop
1  buffalo-milk mozzarella

PREPARATION OF DOUGH: 1. Sprinkle the yeast and half the sugar on the
warm water in a small bowl. Stir until yeast dissolves. Let stand
until mixture is dubbly. 2. Put most of the flour and the salt into a
medium bowl. Stir in the yeast mixture and oil and keep stirring
until a smooth soft dough forms. 3. Knead on a floured surface, using
as much of the remaining flour as necessary to form a stiff elastic
dough. Place dough in a large greased bowl, cover and let rise in a
warm place until doubled in volume (30 to 45 minutes) and not sticky.
While the dough is rising, prepare your topping sauce. 4. Punch down
dough. Knead briefly on lightly floured surface to distribute air
bubbles; let dough rest 5 minutes longer. 5. Flatten dough into
circle on lightly floured surface. Roll out from center towards edges
to form a flat round, then place in a greased 12-inch pizza pan.
Sprinkel dough with extra virgin olive oil. 6. Pour preferred topping
over pizza dough and bake in oven preheated to 220C(450F) until
golden brown (about 20 minutes). Cut into wedges and serve.

Po Valley Pumpkin Pie

pies, deserts, italian

1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
5 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 large egg
1  for the pumpkin filling
1  fresh pumpkin, about 2 pounds, or 1; can
1  solid-pack pumpkin (1 pound)
1/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup sugar
1 teaspoon grund cinnamom
2 large eggs
1 cup almonds, ground
1/2 cup yellow cornmeal
1/2 cup candied orange peel
4 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted

FOR THE PASTA FROLLA:

For the Pasta Frolla:  Combine the dry ingredients and mix well. Rub
in the butter until it is absorbed, making sure the mixture remains
cool and powdery and does not become pastry. Beat the egg and stir in
with a fork. Continue stirring until the dough holds together, then
knead it briefly, just until smooth. Shape into a disk, wrap in
plastic, and regrigerate for at least 1 hour, or until firm.

For the Pumpkin Filling:  Cut the pumpkin into 2-inch dice, scrape
away the filaments from the inside and peel off the skin. Steam the
pumpkin over simmering water for about 40 minutes, until it is
tender. Puree the pumpkin in a blender or a food processor fitted
with a metal blade; cool. If the pumpkin puree is excessively watery,
cook it, stirring constantly, over medium heat, preferably in a
nonstick pan, to dry it out before proceeding.

Measure 2 cups of the pumpkin puree (a little more or less won't
matter) into a large mixing bowl.  Whisk in the salt, sugar,
cinnamon, and eggs, one at a time. Combine the ground almonds and
cornmeal and stir into the pumpkin mixture.  Place the candied orange
peel in a strainer, rinse under cold, running water, and chop it
finely with a sharp knife. (Oil the blade of the knife to prevent it
from sticking to the peel.) Stir the chopped peel into the filling,
then fold in the melted butter.

To Assemble the Pie:  Roll the dough out on a floured surface into a
large disk, about 14 inches in diameter. Fold the disk of dough in
half and fit it into a buttered 9-by-2-inch deep layer cake pan.
Press the dough against the bottom and sides of the pan and trim the
edges so they are even with the top of the pan. Pour in the filling
and spread it evenly. The filling will be about 1/2-inch lower than
the top of the pan. Fold the excess dough at the rim inward so that
it makes a border about 1/2-inch wide at the edge.

Bake the pie in the lower third of a preheated 350 F oven for about 45
minutes, until the filling is set and the dough is a light golden
color. Cool the pie in the pan on a rack. When the pie is completely
cooled, place a flat plate or pan on top and invert.  Lift off the
baking pan and replace it with a platter.  Invert again and remove
the top plate or pan. Keep the pie loosely covered at room
temperature before serving.

Makes 10 servings.

2  eggs
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
2 tablespoon unsalted butter; melted
1 cup all-purpose flour

Recipe by: Williams Sonoma 1994 Holiday Catalog Butter a 6-cup popover or
Texas-sized muffin pan.

In a medium bowl lightly wisk together the eggs and salt.  Stir in the milk
and butter and beat in the flour until just blended.  DO NOT OVERBEAT!  Fil
each cup about half full using all the batter.

oven to 375 F and continue baking 10-15 minutes longer until popovers are
golden and crisp on the outside.  Quickly pierce each popover with a thin
metal skewer or the tip of a small knife to release the steam.  Turn the ov
off and leave in for 5-10 minutes more for further crisping.  Remove and
serve at once.

Makes 6 popovers which are about 142 calories each.

      ----CRUST----
1 1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup pralines; crumbled
1  stick butter; melted
      ----FILLING----
2 1/2 cup milk
3/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 tablespoon steen's pure cane syrup plus 1 tb f; or the whipped cream
5  egg yolks
1/2 cup cornstarch
1 cup pralines; crumbled
1 cup heavy cream
3 tablespoon sugar
      ----GARNISH----
1  chocolate sauce in a squeeze bottle
1  fresh mint sprigs
1  powdered sugar in a shaker

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  In a 9-inch pie pan, combine the

non-reactive sauce pan, combine milk, sugar, vanilla, and syrup over
medium heat. Stir slowly to dissolve the sugar and  heat long enough
to scald the milk. Remove from the heat. In a mixing bowl, combine
egg yolks with the cornstarch and mix well. Add 1/4 cup of the milk
mixture at a time to the egg mixture, blending in between each
addition, until all is combined. Pour the mixture into a saucepan and
over medium heat, stir constantly for 1-2 minutes. Stir until smooth
and thick.  Remove from heat and put through a fine sieve to remove
any lumps. Chill the filling in an ice bath until cold. Fold in the
pralines and spread evenly into the pie crust. Refrigerate for 2
hours or until it sets. For the whipping cream: Using an electric

Puff Pastry (Pate Feuilletee)

pastries, deserts

1 lb all-purpose or unbleached flour, ve; ry accurately
1  weighed
1 lb (4 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cu; t into small
1  pieces
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup heavy cream (or 1/2 cup heavy cream; mixed with 1/2
1  cup ice water)

Makes about 2 pounds

In the bowl of a food processor or using the flat paddle of an
electric mixer, mix 1/2 cup flour with the butter until very smooth.
Shape the mixture into a flat square 1 inch thick, wrap well in
plastic, and chill for at least 30 minutes.

Combine the salt with the remaining flour in a large mixing bowl and
add the cream.  Mix the dough well by hand or with an electric mixer;
the dough will not be completely smooth but it should not be sticky.
Shape it into a flat square 1 1/2 inches thick, wrap in plastic, and
chill, at least 30 minutes.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and, on a lightly floured
board, roll the dough into a rectangle twice as long as the butter
dough. Place the butter dough in the center, fold up the ends to
completely encase the butter dough, and seal the edges by pinching
them together. Wrap well in plastic and chill for at least 30
minutes, so that the dough achieves the same temperature throughout.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and, on a lightly floured
board, roll it out into a large rectangle approximately 1/2 inch
thick. Fold the dough into thirds, aligning the edges carefully and
brushing off any excess flour.  The object is to ensure that the
butter is distributed evenly throughout so that the pastry will puff
evenly when baked. Wrap the dough and chill it for at least 30
minutes. This completes one turn.

Repeat this process five more times; classic puff pastry gets six
turns, creating hundreds of layers of butter between layers of the
flour dough (729 to be exact). Use as little flour as possible when
rolling out the dough, and always brush off any excess.  (I use a
4-inch brush for this.) Remember to let the dough rest for at least
30 minutes in the refrigerator between turns, or 15 minutes in the
freezer.  This chilling makes the rolling out much easier and it
keeps the layers of butter of equal thickness.

By the sixth and final turn, the dough should be very smooth, with no
lumps of butter visible.  Wrap the pastry in plastic wrap and
refrigerate until ready to use (up to 2 days), or freeze for future
use. I usually divide the dough into 1-pound pieces and freeze it
that way.

RECTANGULAR TART SHELLS:  Roll out the pastry into a rectangle at
least 20 inches long and about 1/8 inch thick. Using a ruler as your
guide, cut the edges with a sharp knife so that the pastry measures
the desired size (I generally make these 4 X 18 inches). From the
remaining pastry, cut three strips 1/2 inch wide and as long as the
tart.

Place the rectangle on a parchment-lined or water-sprayed baking
sheet. Build up the edges by pasting two strips on the long edges
with water. Cut the third strip into two strips that will fit the
shorter edges and attach with a bit of cold water, overlapping the
ends. Prick the entire inside bottom of the pastry shell with the
tines of a fork (this prevents uneven puffing).  Carefully line only
the bottom with aluminum foil, and weight with beans, rice, or
aluminum or ceramic weights. (Be careful not to weight the edges.)
Refrigerate, covered, for at least 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 F.  Remove the pastry from the refrigerator
and brush the uncovered edges with a glaze of 1 egg yolk mixed with 2
tsp cream or water. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the edges
have puffed and begun to brown.  Remove the weights and foil, and
continue to bake until the entire shell is light golden brown. Let
cool completely on a wire rack.

Pumpkin & Praline Pie

pies

      ----HOT WATER DOUGH----
2/3 cup lard or shortening, softened
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup boiling water
2 1/4 cup flour, divided
      ----PUMPKIN FILLING----
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1 tablespoon flour
1 tablespoon bitters, optional
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 each egg,slightly beaten
2 tablespoon butter
1 can pumpkin puree (29 oz)
1 can evaporated milk 12 oz
1/4 cup sweet milk
1 cup water
      ----PRALINE----
4 tablespoon butter, softened
2/3 cup light brown sugar
2/3 cup pecans, coarsely chopped
1 single whipped cream or whipped top

TO MAKE HOT WATER DOUGH: Beat lard or shortening and salt in a large
bowl; gradually, beat in boiling water. Cool to room temperature,
stirring, occasionally to prevent water and lard from separating.
Beat in 2 cups flour, then form dough into 2 balls. Flatten each
portion into a 6" disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill. (If desired
refrigerate overnight or freeze up to 1 month.) TO MAKE PUMPKIN
FILLING: Mix sugar, light brown sugar, flour, bitters, if desired,
cinnamon, ginger, salt, nutmeg and cloves in a large bowl. Stir in
egg; set aside. Melt butter in a large skillet over low heat. Add
pumpkin puree; simmer, stirring occasionally, until puree thickens
slightly, about 10 minutes. Gradually, stir hot pumpkin puree into
the sugar mixture. Stir in evaporated milk, sweet milk and 1 cup
water.(If desired, cover and refrigerate overnight.) TO MAKE PRALINE:
Beat butter and brown sugar in a medium bowl. Stir in pecans and set
aside. (If desired,cover and refrigerate overnight.) ASSEMBLE AND
BAKE: Bring chilled dough to room temperature. Working with one disk
at a time, place on a floured surface. Using half of the remaining
1/4 cup flour, roll into a 13" circle, 1/8" thick.
Transfer and fit dough into a 9" deep dish pie pan; trim away excess
dough and flute the edges with a fork. Repeat with remaining disk of
dough to make a second pie shell. Prick each pie shell all over its
surface with a fork. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Freeze pie shells
for 10 minutes. Spread half of the praline mixture over the bottom of
each pie shell. Bake until praline is golden brown and bubbly, about
10 minutes; cool slightly. Reduce oven temperature to
400    degrees.
Pour half the pumpkin filling into each crust; smooth the top of
each with a spatula. Bake until pumpkin filling in each pie pan is
firm and crusts are golden brown, about 1 hour. Cool completely and
serve.
Makes 2 - 9" pies. Top with whipping cream or whipped topping, if
desired. Garnish with whole pecans.

Pumpkin Empanadas

mexican, pies

2 cup unbleached white flour
2 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shortening
1/4 cup cold sweet butter
1 tablespoon brandy
3 tablespoon milk
16 oz canned pumpkin puree
3/4 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoon cinnamon, or 2 teaspoons minced wil; d anise leaves
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1  egg
2 teaspoon pure vanilla
1  egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water; for glaze
2 tablespoon sugar mixed with 1 teaspoon cinnamo; n

Thanksgiving day, I whipped up the following in lieu of the
traditional pumpkin (ho-hum) pie.  Both the crust and the filling are
excellent. The flavors are a bit richer and more interesting than the
traditional punkin' pie (at least my punkin' pie).  The only problem
that I encountered was that the dough was a bit hard to handle++it
tended to tear and was a bit hard to roll out thin.  That may be
because instead of chilling it for a half-hour like the recipe says,
I put it in the fridge and forgot about it for two and a half hours!
It seemed to get easier to handle as it warmed up.  Also, instead of
making the dough by hand, I used my food processor and it turned out
just fine. Just don't over process the dough if you do it that way

These remind me of Mexican Dim-Sum.  In fact I'm sure that they'd be
good with meat fillings too++say, curried pork or beef and onions
(without the final sprinkling of cinnamon sugar though).

Sift together first 4 ingredients.  Cut in the shortening and butter
using a pastry blender or 2 knives. The mixture should resemble
coarse meal.

Combine brandy and milk, and drizzle over flour mixture, stirring
with a fork to distribute.  Do not over-blend.

Form into a flat disc and wrap in plastic wrap.  Chill for 30 minutes.

Preheat oven to 400F.

To make the filling, blend together the pumpkin, brown sugar, spices,
egg and vanilla.

When dough is chilled, roll out thinly on a floured board or pastry
cloth. Cut into 4- or 5-inch circles. Place about 2 tablespoons
pumpkin filling on the lower half of each dough circle. Fold over top
half. Press the edges together with a fork.  Brush tops with egg wash
and place on a baking sheet.  Bake for 15 to 18 minutes, or until
golden.

While still warm, sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar. These may be
baked 1 day ahead.  Before serving, warm in a 350F oven for 8
minutes. Makes 14 to 16 empanadas. Pumpkin Empanadas (Jacqueline
Higuera McMahan)

When Grandmama made these little pies she included anise, which grew
wild around our rancho.

Pumpkin Pie

pies, pastries, holiday

2 tablespoon butter, melted
1 3/4 cup pumpkin (one standard can)
2  eggs
2 tablespoon flour
1 cup evaporated milk
1/2 cup sugar, dark brown
1/2 cup white sugar
1 teaspoon ginger
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon mace
1/4 teaspoon cloves, ground
1/2 teaspoon salt
1  pie shell (standard), uncooked

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.  Beat the eggs until frothy.  Mix in the
sugars and the flour.  Mix in the spices and the salt.  Mix in the pumpkin.
Mix in the melted butter.  Finally, mix in the milk.

Pour the mix into the pie crust and bake at 450 degrees F. for 15 minutes.
Decrease heat to 375 degrees F. and bake for an additional 45 minutes.
Remove the pie from the oven and set it out to cool.

NOTES:

*  A Pumpkin Pie with flour -- This is my mother's recipe for her
traditional Thanksgiving dinner pumpkin pie. It is different from most
other pumpkin pie recipes in that flour and brown sugar are used in the
batter.  Even my wife, who is not a big pumpkin pie fan, thought this was a
yummy pie.

When my parents first got married, every pumpkin pie my mom made for my dad
was rejected with the comment "it's not like mother used to make." She even
tried to use his mother's recipe, but she could not follow it: his mother
used ordinary kitchen utensils for measuring devices (like a teacup for a
"cup," a real table spoon for a "tablespoon," etc.). She finally found a
recipe that looked similar to grandma's. Through the years she has altered
it slightly to make the pie even more tastier.

*  Don't be surprised if the pie rises slightly.  It will go down again
after it cools.

*  Make sure you get just pumpkin.  Don't use a can of "pumpkin pie mix"
instead!  If you were very ambitious, you could gut a pumpkin yourself for
this recipe, but I have never had the time or courage to do that.

*  You can buy a pie shell crust or you can make your own. Certainly, the
results are better when you make your own.

*  Light brown sugar can be used instead of dark, but the result isn't as
good.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, plus desired cooling time.

Pumpkin Pie With Praline

pies, pastries

2 tablespoon (1/4 stick) butte, softened
1/3 cup chopped pecans
1/3 cup brown sugar
2  unbaked 8 inch pie shells, or one u; nbaked 10 inch pie shell
2 tablespoon (1/4 stick) butter
1  29 oz. can pumpkin puree
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon all purpose flour
1 tablespoon bitters (optional)
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1  egg, beaten
1  12 oz. can evaporated milk
1/4 cup milk
1 cup water

Prepare the praline filling, if desired.  Preheat oven to 450 F. In a small
bowl, creme together the butter and brown sugar. Blend in the pecans. Press
firmly into the bottom of the unbaked pie shells.  Bake for 10 minutes,
watching carefully so crusts do not puff up or slip down. Prick puffs with
a fork if you see this happening, and pat the slipping crusts back up in
place with the back of a fork. (This may not happen, but if it does, that
is what you should do.) Let cool before filling. Preheat oven to 400 F.
Melt the butter in a large skillet; add the pumpkin puree. Simmer for 10
minutes, stirring now and then with a wooden spoon. In a large mixer bowl,
mix together the next 9 ingredients. Add the egg, and mix again. Add the
hot pumpkin gradually, then blend in the milks and water. Pour into pie
shells and bake for 1 hour. Let cool completely before cutting. NOTE: The
filling can be made a day in advance and refrigerated.  If you've used the
praline, you may have extra pumpkin filling; bake it in individual custard
cups.

Pumpkin Walnut Cheesecake

pies, deserts, cheese cake

6 oz zwieback crackers, crushed
1 cup sugar
3/4 cup brown sugar
6 tablespoon butter, melted
24 oz cream cheese, softened
5  eggs
16 oz pumpkin
1 3/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/4 cup heavy cream
1  topping:
6 tablespoon butter, softened
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped

Blend zwieback crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar, and the 6 tablespoons melted
butter. Press firmly over bottom and up sides of a lightly buttered
9-inch spring-form pan. Chill. Beat the cream cheese until smooth.
Add the 3/4 cup sugar and the 3/4 cup brown sugar, beating until well
mixed. Beat in the eggs one at a time, until mixture is light and
fluffy. Beat in the pumpkin pie spice and the heavy cream at low
speed. Mix in the pumpkin. Pour into prepared pan. Bake in a slow
oven (325) for one hour and 35 minutes. While pie is baking, mix the
topping ingredients (the last 3 ingredients), first the butter and
brown sugar until crumbly, then blending in the nuts. After the one
hour and 35 minutes, remove the pie from the oven. Spread the topping
over it, and return it to the oven for 10 minutes. Remove from oven
and cool on a wire rack. Refrigerate for several hours, or overnight.
This cheesecake is rather large, and incredibly rich. Everyone always
wants more than they can fit in their stomach! And the recipe!
:-) Serving suggestion: Some like this garnished with whipped cream
and more walnuts, or with whipped cream and pecans.

Quiche Pastry

breads, pies

1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoon cold butter; cut into small pieces
2 tablespoon vegetable shortening; cut into small pieces
4 1/2 tablespoon ice water

Place the flour, salt, butter and shortening in a large bowl. Rub the
flour and fat together until the fat is broken into pieces the size
of oatmeal flakes. Don't over-blend. Using a pastry knife, add the
ice water, a little at a time, mixing until it just starts to hold
together. Press the dough into a roughly shaped ball. Knead it
briefly into a fairly smooth ball, then sprinkle lightly with flour
and wrap in a sheet of waxed paper. Chill 1-2 hours in the
refrigerator. When ready to roll, sprinkle work surface and rolling
pin with flour and roll the pastry out into a circle 1/8" to 1/4"
thick.

Butter a 9" pie tin. Place the crust in the pan and press gently to
line the inside. Crimp edges. To partially bake the shell, line the
pastry with buttered, lightweight foil. Fill the center with dry
beans or rice. Bake in the middle level of a preheated 400øF for
about 8-9 minutes or until the pastry seems set. Remove foil and
beans, prick bottom of the pastry with a fork, and return to oven for
2-3 minutes.

Quick Puff Pastry - Master Chefs

pastries

4 cup flour, instant, or more
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 lb butter, unsalted, cut into - large; chunks
3/4 cup water, cold (about)

For Quick Puff Pastry: ======================

In a mixing bowl or mixer, roughly combine the flour, salt and
butter, breaking up the butter slightly (there should be visible
chunks). Gradually add just enough cold water to hold the dough
together. DO NOT OVERWORK.

Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and roll it
into a rectangular shape about 9 by 12 inches. Dust the board, dough,
and rolling pin with flour as often as necessary to prevent sticking.
Starting with the closest short end, fold the dough into thirds as
you would a letter.  Rotate the dough so the open side is at your
right. Repeat, rolling the dough into a rectangle, folding it into
thirds and rotating is as before.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and
chill for at least 1 hour.

Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface with the open
side at your right.  Roll the dough into a rectangle as before. Now
bring the two short ends together to meet in the center of the dough,
then fold the dough in half again toward you.  Rotate a 1/4 turn, so
the open side is again at your right. Repeat, rolling the dough into
a rectangle, folding in half, then in half again, and rotating a 1/4
turn. Wrap the dough and chill again for at least 1 hour.

Rafiola Kokokarion (Coconut Pastries W/ Glace

pastries, deserts, greek

1  karen mintzias
3  potatoes
3 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 pinch salt
2  egg yolks
4 cup finely shredded coconut
1 1/2 cup glaceed fruit
1  confectioners' sugar

(Author's note): In a Cretan zacharoplasteion (sweet shop), we were so
intrigued by these coconut pastries (among the newer breed) that I
tried them at home. You can expect the potato pastry to be a bit
difficult to manipulate, and you can also anticipate compliments on
the results. Attractive and tasty, not excessively sweet.

Boil the potatoes in their jackets until fork tender, then drain and
remove the skins and all spots. Return the potatoes to the pan and
dry over medium heat, shaking pan constantly. Push the potatoes
through a mill or ricer, then combine in a large bowl with the sugar
and salt. When somewhat cool, add the egg yolks and coconut and knead
until smooth. Refrigerate for 2 hours.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and knead until smooth enough
to roll. If sticky, dust lightly with flour. Roll out on a floured
board to 1/4-inch thickness, then, using a glass with a 3-1/2-inch
diameter, cut the pastry into rounds.

Meanwhile, mince the glaceed fruit. Place 1 tablespoon on the center
of each of the pastry rounds. Lift one side with a spatula and fold
over the other half, forming a half-circle. Press the edges together
and place on a baking sheet. Continue until all have been stuffed,
then bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 15 minutes, or until firm;
the pastries will be white. Remove and cool for 10 minutes, then roll
in confectioners' sugar and cool completely. Store in a covered
container.

Note: In Crete this pastry is cut with a serrated pastry cutter
producing an attractive edging.

Rhubarb & Raspberry Pie

pies, deserts

1 x no ingredients

Nostalgia reigns with this satisfying dessert pie. The wonderfully
crunchy crust makes a great combination with the smooth slightly tart
filling. Preparation time: 20 minutes.  Cooking time: 1 hour plus 1
hour standing for pastry.

Crumbly Pastry 2 cups plain flour 1/4 cup sugar pinch of salt 125g
unsalted butter, at room temperature 2 eggs, lightly beaten with a
fork

Filling 500g rhubarb, trimmed and roughly chopped 1/4 cup water 1/2
cup sugar 2 teaspoons lemon zest 250g raspberries (fresh or frozen
but if using frozen raspberries drain excess juice) 2 teaspoons
cornflour To serve: icing sugar to dust

To prepare the pastry, combine flour, sugar and salt in a mixing bowl
or blender.  Make a well in centre of dry ingredients and add butter
and eggs. Using a fork, rapidly combine ingredients, or blend for
about 30 seconds to combine.  Turn onto a lightly floured surface and
knead briefly. Gather pastry into a ball, wrap in plastic food wrap
and refrigerate for 1 hour. Meanwhile, prepare the filling: place
rhubarb, water and sugar in a saucepan and cook over a medium heat
for 6-8 minutes, until rhubarb is tender.  Cool slightly, then gently
fold in lemon zest, raspberries and cornflour mixed with a little
water.  Divide dough into 2 pieces, one slightly bigger than the
other. Chill the smaller ball. On a well floured board, roll larger
ball to fit a 24cm round pie dish to a thickness of about 3mm.  Line
pie dish with pastry. Spoon fill- ing over pastry base. Grate chilled
pastry over top of filling. Bake at l80C for 50-60 minutes until
light golden in colour. Serve warm, sprinkled with icing sugar.

Rhubarb Lemon Tofu "Pie" (Vlf Vegan)

pies, deserts

5  stalks rhubarb, washed,
1  leaves discarded
1  granny smith apple, peeled,
1  cored and cubed
1  dozen large strawberries
6 oz firm (reduced fat) tofu
1  juice of 1/2 lemon
1/4 cup + 2 t sugar
2 tablespoon whole wheat flour
2 teaspoon sugar + 2 t whole wheat
1  flour (or optional pie crust
1  and crust crumble)

In a rice cooker, (or pot) add a little water and the rhubarb stalks,
chopped.  Cook covered for several minutes (be more observant if doing
rangetop cooking, as heat source may be hotter, and add water as
needed). When rhubarb is pretty well done, carefully remove the cover
(have an oven mitt on) and add the cubed apple, strawberries, and 1/4
c sugar. Cover and continue cooking a few more minutes.

Meanwhile, puree the tofu in a food processor or chopper, until very
smooth.  Add lemon juice, 2 T sugar, 2 T whole wheat flour, and
process until well blended. Line an 8" pie tin with oil, (here you
can add a pie shell if you prefer, instead of...) and sprinkle to
coat with a sugar and whole wheat flour mixture, about 2 t each.
Spread the tofu mixture into the pie tin (or onto the crust).  Bake
at 400 F for a few minutes, (until crust is done, if using a crust).
Remove and cool.

Check rhubarb mixture for sweetness (I use a minimum of sugar), and
adjust to your preference.  Pour into a fine (or cheesecloth lined)
seive, and drain off juices, do not squeese dry. Save juices for some
other use (perhaps for a jelly).  Pour remaining rhubarb mixture over
the baked lemon tofu. Refrigerate (or top with crust crumble and bake
again until done). The texture of the fruit mixture does not jell, or
thicken, when the smaller amount of sugar is used, but I like it the
way it is. The lemon tofu is in sweet contrast to the more tart but
still sweet rhubarb and fruit filling.

1/4 cup sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1  egg
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1  sweetned whipped cream(opt)
1  sliced fresh fruit (opt)

medium-low heat until thick and creamy, about 25-35 minutes. 3.
Meanwhile, in small bowl, beat together egg and egg whites. Remove
hot rice mixture from heat; stir a small amount of the hot rice
mixture in beaten eggs. Stir egg mixture into hot rice mixture, then
return to saucepan. Stir in remaining 3/4 c milk and vanilla and

Ricotta Cheese Pie With Pine Nut Crust

pies, deserts

      ----CRUST----
1/4 cup butter unsalted
3/4 cup crumbs from amaretto cookies
1/2 cup pine nuts
      ----CHEESE FILLING----
15 oz ricotta cheese
1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 cup sour cream
2 tablespoon four
2 teaspoon lemon peel
2  eggs

Berries, grapes, or orange garnish.

To make crust, place melted butter in 9 inch pie plate. Stir in cookie
crumbs and pine nuts until well blended. Press firmly against bottom
and sides of dish to form crust. Heat until set.

To make filling, combine ricotte cheese, sour cream, sugar, flour,
lemon peel, and eggs in 8 cup glass measure. Heat until center is
very warm to the touch, stirring every two minutes. (Microwave is
easy). Mixture will be a little lumpy at this point but will cook
into a smooth pie. Pour filling into crust, smoothing it evenly on
top. Place pie on top of microwave proof cereal bowl and microwave on
medium for 8 to 14 minutes or until almost set in center, rotating
one quarter turn once or twice. Let stand directly on counter for 30
minutes.  Chill for 3 hours or overnight before serving. Garnish pie.
To test to see if done, touch the top 1 inch from the center with
your finger. When top adheres to your finger, cheese cake underneath
should appear to be moist but set, not gooey. Sides should begin to
pull away from dish.

Robb's Special Cherry Pie

fruits, pies, deserts

      ----PASTRY----
2 2/3 cup pastry flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cup vegetable shortening
1  ice water - 8 to 12 tbs
      ----FILLING----
2  (1 lb.) cans pitted tart red  cherr; ies (water pack)
1/3 cup liquid from cherries
3 tablespoon quick-cooking tapioca
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon red food coloring
1 1/4 cup sugar
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/16 teaspoon ground cloves
2 tablespoon butter or margarine

(DIRECTIONS FOR PASTRY) Combine flour and salt in large mixing bowl.
Cut shortening into flour mixture, using pastry blender, until mixture
resembles coarse crumbs with a few pea-size pieces. Sprinkle 4
tablespoons ice water over mixture and toss mixture with two forks.
Sprinkle another 4 tablespoons ice water over mixture and toss
mixture again. If mixture can be pressed together to form a solid
mass do not add additional water. If mixture is still crumbly, add
additional ice water 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing mixture with
forks, until a mass can be formed. Divide mixture and form 2 balls of
dough, one slightly larger than the other. Press the larger ball of
dough into a disk and roll between sheets of waxed paper until
1/8-inch thick. Line deep 9-inch pyrex pie plate with pastry and trim
edges to 3/4-inch beyond edge of plate.  Set aside. Press remaining
ball of dough into a disk and roll between sheets of waxed paper
until 1/8-inch thick. Set aside. (DIRECTIONS FOR FILLING) Drain
cherries. Measure 1/3 cup liquid into mixing bowl. Discard remaining
liquid. Add tapioca, salt, almond extract, lemon juice and food
coloring, then cherries. Combine 1 cup sugar, cinnamon and cloves.
Pour sugar mixture over cherries. Mix and let stand at least 15
minutes. Fill pastry with cherry mixture. Dot with butter. Sprinkle
with remaining sugar. Moisten rim with water. Fit top pastry over
filling. Turn top edge over bottom edge and press firmly together,
creating fluted edge. Cut vents in top to allow steam to escape and
juices to bubble. Bake at 425 degrees for 15 minutes. Reduce
temperature to 375 degrees and continue baking for 35-45 minutes, or
until filling is bubbling and crust is golden brown. If edge of crust
appears to be browning too quickly, cover lightly with aluminum foil.
Cool pie thoroughly on wire rack. Note:  The spice flavor is quite
subtle, but very effective when combined with the lemon juice and
almond extract. Try these modest amounts first (I prefer them), or
increase them to suit

Rosehip~ Hibiscus & Currant Pie Or Cake Filling

cakes, fruits, pies, flowers

1 1/2 cup water
3 oz rosehips
1/2 cup brown sugar
1  cinnamon stick
3  herbal tea bags (a brand
1  with hibiscus or rosehips
1 cup currant jelly, red or black
1  or a mixture
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoon butter or marg.
1/2 teaspoon flour

Boil the water, cinnamon, and herbal tea until the water is reduced
to one cup. Remove the cinnamon and herbal tea and add the brown
sugar, lemon juice, and rosehips, and simmer briskly (medium heat)
until the water is just above the rosehips. Then, add the currant
jelly, and stir till it is all dissolved; continue simmering for five
minutes, stirring all the while and watching carefully for scorching.
Blend butter and flour thoroughly, and stir into the currant jelly
mixture until it is thickened. Take the mixture off the heat; it is
ready to use.

Note#1 : If you want to avoid the extra butter, blend the flour with a
tablespoon or more of water; you want to suspend the flour in the
water, not have a batter. Take the currant mixture off the heat, stir
in the flour mixture all at once and thoroughly, and then return it
to the heat to thicken.

Note #2: omit the butter and flour, and perhaps add a chopped apple,
some raisins, etc, for a healthful fruit stew.

Rough Puff Pastry

pastries, deserts

8 oz plain (all purpose) flour
1 pinch of salt
6 oz margarine
6 tablespoon to 8 tb cold water

1. Sieve the flour and salt into a mixing bowl. 2. Cut the margarine
into small pieces (size of a walnut). Add to the flour and toss
lightly with the fingertips so that each piece of margarine is coated
with flour - but not broken up. 3. Add 6 Tablespoons water and mix
lightly with the blade of a knife into a soft dough, making sure that
the pieces of margarine are kept whole.  If some of the flour is
loose in the bowl, add a little more water and mix until it is worked
in and the dough fairly soft. 4. Gather together with the fingertips,
turn out onto a well-floured board and again sprinkle with flour. 5.
Form into a small oblong, flour the rolling pin and roll lightly and
carefully to a strip approximately 10 inches by 5 inches. 6. Brush
off any surplus flour. Fold into three by folding the bottom third
upwards and the top third downwards and over to cover it. 7. Lightly
press the three open edges with the rolling pin to seal.

Second Rolling:

8. Turn the pastry round on the board so that the right hand edge
faces you. Roll out to a strip approximately 9 inches by 6 inches. 9.
Brush off any surplus flour. Fold into three again and seal the
edges. Place on a floured plate; sprinkle with flour; cover with a
damp cloth or plastic bag and leave in a cold place for 20 minutes.

Third and Fourth Rollings:

10. Repeat stages 8 and 9 for the third rolling (the resting period
can be omitted) and again for the fourth rolling. (If the dough is
streaky and rough in appearance, give it a fifth rolling. 11. After
the last rolling and final resting, the pastry is ready to roll to
the thickness stated in the recipe used.

Following is the recipe for Eccles Cakes, using this pastry.

Savory Chicken Pot Pies

pies, american

2  chicken breast halves
6  chicken thighs
1  salt
1  pepper
2 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon oil
1 can chicken broth (49.5 oz)
1 small onion, cut into quarters
1  celery stalk, cut into chunks
1 small carrot, peeled, cut into chunks
1/4 cup melted butter
1/4 cup flour
2 tablespoon minced tarragon
1 cup pearl onions, peeled
1 medium potato, peeled, cut into 1/2 chunks
4 small carrots, cut into 1/2 diagonal slic; es (~1 1/2 c)
2 cup broccoli florets
1 1/2 cup quartered button mushrooms
1  rich pastry crust
2  egg yolks, beaten

This refined version of an old American classic has a rich, flaky,
meaty-tasting crust, thanks to its mixture of lard and chicken fat.
The latter is a handy byproduct of the precooking of the chicken the
day before. Make sure the chicken fat is good and cold when making
the crust.

Season chicken parts to taste with salt and pepper. Melt 2 tablespoons
butter and oil together in soup pot. Add chicken and brown. Add
chicken broth, quartered onion, celery chunks and carrot chunks and
bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until chicken is tender, 20-30
minutes. Let cool. Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Next day, skim cold chicken fat off top of broth. Reserve 1/4 cup fat
for making Rich Pastry Crust. (Keep reserved chicken fat in
refrigerator.)

Heat broth and remove chicken. Skin and bone chicken parts. Discard
skin and bones. Cut meat into 2" chunks and set aside.

Strain broth. Reduce over high heat to 3 cups. Combine 1/4 cup melted
butter and flour in saucepan and gradually stir in broth. Bring to
boil and boil 1 minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in
tarragon.

Cook pearl onions, potato, sliced carrots and broccoli separately in
boiling water until tender, 5-10 minutes each. Drain.

Toss together cooked chicken, cooked vegetables and mushrooms. Stir in
chicken-tarragon sauce. Divide into 4 (2 cup) oval casseroles.

Make Rich Pastry Crust. Divide dough in half and gather into 2 small
flattened rounds. Roll first half on lightly floured board to 1/4"
thick Cut dough to fit tops of 2 casseroles, leaving enough dough to
overhang edges by 1". Repeat with second half of dough.

Brush edges of casseroles with egg yolk and place crusts atop
casseroles. Flute edges. Make 4 triangular cuts in center of each
crust and fold back tips of triangles. Brush crust with egg yolk
(save egg whites for another use). Bake at 400'F. until crust is
golden brown and contents hot and bubbly, 20-30 minutes. Makes 4
servings.

Shaker Pumpkin Pie

pies, deserts

1 tablespoon dark molasses
3/4 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
2 large eggs
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 1/4 cup pumpkin puree, prefer fresh*
1 pinch salt 1/2 c  sugar
1 cup heavy cream, cold
2 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted

This spicy pumpkin pie can be made a day ahead and kept, lightly
covered, at room temperature until serving time.  To serve in the
Pleasant Hill (a Shaker Village in Kentucky featured in the article)
style, accompany with a bowl of whipped cream.  Make Flaky Pie Crust.
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Heat milk in small heavy saucepan over
medium heat until small bubbles form around edges of pan; remove from
heat. Beat eggs lightly in large bowl until frothy.  Add scalded milk
in thin steady stream, stirring constantly; stir in remaining
ingredients except for cream.  Whisk until thoroughly blended.  Pour
filling into prepared crust; bake until center is firm and small
knife inserted in center of pie is withdrawn clean, about 45 minutes.
Cool completely on wire rack. At serving time, beat cream in chilled
small mixer bowl with chilled beaters until soft peaks form. Transfer
to serving bowl and serve with pie. TIP: *For fresh pumpkin puree,
split a medium pumpkin crosswise; remove and discard seeds and
fibers. Place pumpkin, cut side down, on lightly greased baking
sheet; bake in 325 degrees F oven until tender when pierced with
knife, about 1 hour. Scrape pulp away from skin; discard skin.  Place
pulp in blender or food processor fitted with metal blade; process in
batches, until smooth. Force puree through coarse sieve. Measure 1.25
cups puree for recipe; reserve remainder for other purpose.  Pumpkin
puree can be frozen, tightly covered, up to 6 months. If using canned
pumpkin, use solid-pack, unsweetened. FROM: "Shaker Thanksgiving",

Sharon's Famous Passover Brownies & Brownie Ice Cream Pie

pies, bars, jewish, frostings

2  slightly beaten eggs
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup cocoa powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup cooking oil
1/2 cup matzo cake meal
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate pieces
1/2 cup coarsely chopped nuts (opt) dark ch; ocolate glaze (opt)

In mixing bowl, beat eggs, sugar, cocoa powder and salt.

Add oil to mixing bowl and blend well. Stir in the matzo cake meal and
chocolate pieces. Stir in nuts, if desired.

Line an 8x8x2" baking pan with foil. Grease lightly. Turn batter into
prepared pan and spread evenly.

Bake at 325-F for 25 to 30 minutes or till done (top will be shiny and
edges dry). Let cool in pan on wire rack.

Meanwhile, prepare glaze if desired. Spread over cooled brownies.

Dark Chocolate Glaze: In a small heavy saucepan or skillet, melt 1 cup
semisweet chocolate pieces over low heat. Remove from heat and stir
in 1 tsp butter or margarine. In a small bowl, dissolve 1/2 tsp
instant coffee crystals in 1 Tbsp hot water. Stir in 3 Tbsp dairy
sour cream and 1/4 tsp maple flavoring. Add sour cream mixture to
chocolate, stirring till smooth and shiny. Makes about 3/4 cup.

Note: For a regular brownie, you can substitute 3/4 cup all purpose
flour for the matzo cake meal and add 1 tsp vanilla. Also, you can
double the recipe. Use a 13x9x2" baking pan and bake batter for about
30    minutes.

Brownie Ice Cream Pie: Prepare brownie batter as directed. Line a 9"
pie plate with foil and grease lightly. Turn batter into pie plate.
Bake at 325-F for 30 minutes. Remove from oven. Using the back of a
wooden spoon dipped in cocoa powder, press hot brownies down, then
gradually outward and evenly up the sides of pie plate. Cool, then
freeze till firm.

Make Dark Chocolate Glaze while crust is freezing; cool glaze to room
temperature. Lift shell from plate; remove foil. Fill with 1/2 gal of
slightly softened ice cream or frozen yogurt, adding a middle layer
of the glaze and more chopped nuts. (If you'd like a smaller pie, use
1 qt of ice cream in the crust, then top with glaze and chopped
nuts.) Sharon Winstein and her friend Louise Levitt created these
flour-free brownies for their first temple cooking class. For a
twist, make the Brownie Ice Cream Pie.

Sky-High Lemon Pie

pies

2 1/4 cup sugar
4 tablespoon cornstarch
4 tablespoon flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cup water
4  eggs, separated
1 tablespoon grated lemon rind
6 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoon lemon extract
4 oz can toasted coconut chips
1  recipe plain pastry for 1  9 inch c; rust

Prepare pastry recipe.  Roll out to a 12 " round on a lightly floured
pastry cloth or board; fit into a 9" pie plate. Trim overhang to
1/2"; turn under flush with rim & flute to make a stand-up edge;
prick well all over with a fork.

Bake in hot oven, 425, for 15 minutes or until golden; cool
completely on a wire rack

Mix 1-3/4 cups of the sugar, cornstarch, flour, and salt in a
medium-size bowl.

Heat water to boiling in a medium-size saucepan. Lower heat to medium;
slowly add sugar mixture, stirring gently but constantly. Cook,
stirring constantly, 5 to 7 minutes or until mixture holds a line
when cut with a spoon; remove from heat at once. Do not let mixture
boil.

Beat egg yolks slightly in bowl; stir in 1/2 cup hot mixture; quickly
stir back into mixture in saucepan. Cook, stirring constantly over
medium heat, for 3 minutes or until mixture thickens. Remove from
heat.

Stir in lemon rind, juice, butter or margarine until blended. Pour
into cool pastry shell.

Beat egg whites with lemon extract until foamy, white and double in
volume in bowl.  Sprinkle in 1/2 cup sugar, 1 Tbsp. at a time,
beating all the time until sugar dissolves and meringue stands in
firm peaks.

Pile onto hot filling, spreading to edge of crust. This keeps
meringue from shrinking.  Sprinkle with coconut chips, or place them
in a pretty pattern on top.

Bake in moderate oven, 350 F degrees, 12 minutes, or until peaks of
meringue are a golden brown.  Cool completely on a wire rack before
cutting

Sliced Sweet Potato Pie

pies, pastries, deserts

4  sweet potatoes (med)
1 cup light brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ginger
1/4 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoon butter or margarine
1/2 cup heavy cream

Pastry for 2-crust pie. Boil sweet potatoes until half-cooked, 15-20
minutes.  Peel and slice thinly. Mix sugar, spices and salt. Place a layer
of sweet potatoes in pastry-lined 9" pie pan, sprinkle with some of the
sugar-spice mixture and dot with a little butter. Continue until all
ingredients are used, dotting top with butter. Add cream. Adjust top crust:
flute edges and cut vents. Bake in hot oven (425 degrees) 30-40 minutes. If
potatoes are still not tender reduce temperture to 350 F. and continue
baking until done. Note: I tried the above baking directions and got a
rather brown crust. When I tried baking it at an initial temp. of 425 F.
for 15 minutes and reducing it to 325 F. afterwards for 45 minutes more, I
got a better crust and the filling was always cooked...

Smetanik - Berry Jam & Sour Cream Pie

pies, pastries, ethnic

      ----PASTRY DOUGH----
8 tablespoon butter; unsalted
1  ; cut into 1/4 bits; chille
3 tablespoon shortening; vegetable,chilled
2 1/4 cup flour; all purpose
1/4 teaspoon salt
5 tablespoon water; iced; more as needed
      ----FILLING----
2 cup almonds; finely ground
4 teaspoon milk
6 tablespoon rasberry jam
6 tablespoon cherry jam
2  egg yolks
1/3 cup sour cream
2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 tablespoon butter; softened

Pastry: In a large mixing bowl, combine the butter, vegetable shortening,
flour and salt. Working quickly, use your fingertips to rub flour and fat
together until they blend and look like flakes of course meal. Pour ice
water over over mixture all at once, toss together lightly and gather dough
into a ball. If dough crumbles, add up to 2 more tablespoons per batch you
are making, drop by drop until particles adhere. Divide the dough in half,
dust each half lightly with flour and wrap separately in sheets of wax
paper. Refrigerate at least 3 hours until firm.

Filling: Soak the almonds in milk for 5-10 minutes. With the back of a
large spoon, rub the jams through a fine seive set over a large bowl. THen
beat in it the egg yolks, sour cream, cinnamon, the nuts and their soaking
milk. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 12" circle about
1/8" thick. With a pastry brush, coat the bottom and sides of a 9" false
bottom tart pan with the softened butter. Gently press the pastry into the
bottom and around the sides of the pan, being careful not to stretch it.
Roll the pin over the rim of the pan, pressing down hard to trim off excess
pastry. Preheat oven to 425. Pour the filling into the pastry shell and
roll out other half of dough into a 12" circle. Drape it over the rolling
pin, lift it up and unfold it over the filling. Press the edges of the
pastry layers together. Then crimp them with your fingers or press them
firmly around the rim with the prongs of a fork.. With a sharp knife, cut 3
slits about 1" apart in the top of the pastry. Bake in the center of the
oven for 30 minutes or until pastry is golden brown. Then set the pan on a
large jar or coffee can and carefully slip off the outside rim. Let the pie
cool to room temperature before serving.

* This is a tasty and QUICK pie if you use commercial premade pie crusts,
although you should make it at least once from scratch

Southern Cream Apple Pie

pies, pastries

      ----PIE----
22 oz tart apples
1 1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup flour
3 cup sour cream
2  eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla
2  pastry shells, deep-dish, about 9 i; nches wide
      ----TOPPING----
1 1/8 cup sugar
3/4 cup flour
1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup butter

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  In a large bowl, combine the sugar,
flour, sour cream, eggs and vanilla into a smooth mixture.

Core, peel and chop the apples.  Boil them in a small amount of water with
a little lemon juice for 3 to 5 minutes until they begin to get tender.
Drain apples and add to the mixture.

Pour into two 9-inch pastry shells.  Bake at 400 degrees F. for 30 minutes.

While pies are baking, crumble topping ingredients into a bowl and mix with
a pastry cutter or two knives. Remove pies from oven and cover with topping
recipe.  Put pies under broiler for 1 to 2 minutes until the topping begins
to bubble.

Don't take your eyes off the pies while they're under the broiler.  A
moment's inattention can mean burned pie!

NOTES:

*  Apple pie with sour cream goodness -- This recipe came from my wife's
boss, Dick Dolan, the editor of the _Hewlett Packard Journal_. It is
sinfully delicious and never lasts very long, even if you don't have help
eating it!

*  If there is any pie left over, the remainder should be refrigerated.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 30 minutes baking.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

Spinach Empanadas

pies

      ----PASTRY----
16 oz cream cheese, softened
3/4 cup butter, softened
2 1/2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
      ----FILLING----
1/4 cup onion, finely chopped
3  garlic clove; minced
4 slice bacon, cooked and crumbled
1 tablespoon bacon drippings
10 oz spinach, frozen; thawed and drained
1 cup cottage cheese
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg, ground
1  egg, beaten

In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and butter till smooth.
(Use a stand mixer, since the mixture is heavy.) Gradually add in the
flour and salt. Lightly knead the dough by hand. Cover with plastic
wrap and refrigerate for 3 hours.

In a medium skillet, cook the onion and garlic in the bacon drippings
until the onion is tender but not brown. Mix in the bacon, spinach,
cottage cheese, pepper, and nutmeg; let the mixture cool.

Preheat the oven to 450 F. Roll out the pastry on a floured surface
to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Cut 3-inch circles in the pastry, place 1
teaspoon of the filling in each circle, just to one side of the
center. Moisten the edge of the circle with the egg, fold the dough
in half over the filling to make a semicircular empanada. Seal the
edges with fork tines, and poke the top of each pastry with a fork to
make a vent. Put the empanadas on an ungreased cookie sheet, brush
their tops with egg, and bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden.

Makes 60 empanadas.

Dough:  In a large bowl, mix together yeast, water, and sugar. Let
stand 5 minutes.  Add oil, flour, and salt. Knead about 5 minutes
into a smooth, elastic ball of dough, Cover and let rise until double
in size. Punch down. Filling:  Mix together TVP, boiling water,
oregano, basil, and fennel seeds. In a large skillet, heat olive oil.
Saute TVP mixture for a few minutes. Stir in mushrooms, spinach,
tomato paste, and water until heated through. Preheat oven to 375
degrees. Roll the dough into a large oblong shape, spread filling
evenly on top and roll up like a jelly roll. Brush top with a little
bit of milk or oil. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes. If crust begins to
brown too much, cover with foil during the last 5 or 10 minutes. Cut
into 16 slices to serve. Note: I have used half the oil in the bread
and 1/3 the oil in the filling with good results. Also, salt is
really needed in the filling (if you like salt).

Standard Pie Crust (Mom's)

pies

2/3 cup plus 2 tbsp shortening --or--- 2/3; cup lard
2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoon to 5 tbsp cold water

For Two-Crust 8-or-9" Pie:

Mix together flour and salt.  Cut shortening into flour/salt mixture
until particles are the size of small peas. Sprinkle in water, 1 Tbsp
at a time, mixing with a fork until all flour is moistened and pastry
almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 tsp additional water may be added
if dough is still too dry).

Divide pastry in half and shape each into flattened rounds on a
lightly floured cloth-covered board.  Roll one round of pastry 2
inches larger than your inverted pie plate using a floured rolling
pin. Fold pastry into quarters; place in 1/4 of the pie plate. Unfold
and ease into the plate, pressing firmly against bottom and sides.

Turn desired filling into pastry-lined pie plate. Trim overhanging
edge of pastry 1/2" from rim of plate. Roll the second round of
pastry using the same method for the first round. Place over filling
and unfold. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1" from rim of plate.
Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal --
flute either by hand or with a fork.  With a sharp knife, cut slits
in the top pie crust to allow steam to escape.  Cover edge of crust
with 2-to-3" wide strips of aluminum foil to prevent excessive
browning; remove foil during last 15 minutes of baking. Bake as
directed in pie recipe.

For a One-Crust 8-or-9" Pie:

Cut all ingredients by half, and use the same mixing and placement
method as used for the first round of dough in the two-crust pie
above. Trim overhanging dough to 1" from rim of plate. Fold and roll
pastry under, even with the plate; flute by hand or with a fork. Fill
and bake as directed in recipe.

For a 8-or-9" Baked Pie Shell:

Use the same instruction for ingredients, mixing, and placement for
1-crust pie.  Instead of filling crust, use a fork to thoroughly
prick the bottom and sides of pastry. Bake at 475 until lightly
brown, about 8-10 minutes; cool.  Fill as desired.

Steak & Kidney Pie With Guinness

pies

2 lb chuck steak; trimmed, in 1.2 inch piec
12 oz ox kidney; cored and chopped
1/4 pint guinness
4 tablespoon beef dripping or lard
2 medium onions; sliced
3 tablespoon flour; liberally seasoned
2 large mushrooms; sliced
3/4 pint beef stock or water
1  bay leaf
4  thyme; sprigs
      ----FOR THE PASTRY----
8 oz self-raising flour
4 oz shredded suet or lard
1  salt and pepper
1  egg yolk; mixed with a splash of mi

Place the steak and kidney in a bowl with the guinness and herbs.
Cover and leave for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. Drain the
meat, reserving the marinade. Toss the meat in the seasoned flour.
Heat 1 tsp of the dripping or lard in a large, heavy pan and gently
fry the onions for five minutes. Remove the onions to a plate, add
more of the dripping to the pan and fry the floured meat in batches
until it's browned on all sides. Return the onions and the rest of
the meat and any remaining flour to the pan. Stir thoroughly, then
add the mushrooms, marinade, herbs and stock or water. Bring slowly
to a simmer, stirring as the sauce thickens, then cover the pan and
cook gently for 1.5 hours. Taste the gravy, adjust the seasoning with
salt and pepper and remove the herbs. Transfer to a deep pie dish,
place a pie funnel in the middle and leave to cool.

To Make the pastry. Sift the flour into a bowl. Sprinkle in the suet
or add the lard, season with salt and pepper and mix lightly with
your hands. Sprinkle in 2 tb of cold water, adding more as you mix
with a knife. As it begins to clump together, use your hands to work
it into a smooth, elastic dough. Leave to rest for five minutes, then
roll out the pastry slightly thicker than normal. Cut a one-inch
strip and lay it around the inside edge of the pie dish. Dampen it
with water, then put the pastry lid in place. Trim and crimp the
edge, knocking it back with the flat blade of a knife so that the
actual edge looks as deep as possible. Make a small steamhole in the
centre and cut some leaves from the pastry trimmings to decorate the
top. Paint the pie lid with glaze. Bake in a pre-heated oven to
200C/400F/Gas Mark 6 for 15 minutes. Lower the heat to 180C/350F/Gas
mark 4 and cook for 30 minutes until the pastry is golden brown.

Strawberry Cheesecake Pie

pies, cheese cake, crust

1  -
2 cup unbleached flour
1/3 cup oil
1/4 cup water -- ice cold
1 pkg fat-free cream cheese -- (8
1  oz) softened
1 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon lemon peel -- grated
2 tablespoon lemon juice
4 cup fresh strawberries -- sliced
2 pkg frozen strawberries --
1  mashed
1/4 cup cornstarch
      Pie Crust----
      Filling----

Preheat oven at 350.  To prepare crust, prepare a 9" pie pan with
cooking spray and flour.  Place flour in a bowl and drizzle with oil.
Use a pastry blender to evenly distribute the oil and produce a
mixture the consistency of coarse cornmeal.  Sprinkle on the water, 1
tablespoon at a time, and continue mixing until you can gather the
dough into a ball. Roll the dough into a 11" circle onto a floured
surface.  Patch any cracks that may form, but otherwise try not to
handle the dough more than necessary. Transfer the dough to prepared
pie pan.  Trim the dough, leaving a 1" overhang. Crimp the
overhanging dough into a decorative edge. Chill the crust 20 minutes.
To prepare filling, in a mixing bowl, combine cream cheese, 1/2 cup
sugar, lemon peel, and juice until creamy. Spread mixture into pie
shell and top with fresh strawberries. In a saucepan, cook frozen
strawberries, remaining sugar, and cornstarch until bubbly then cook
two minutes more. Cool completely; pour over strawberries in pie
shell. Chill.

Strawberry Lime Tart

pies, deserts, fruits/nuts

1  no-roll tart shell (see recipe)
      ----LIME CURD----
1/3 cup strained lime juice
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1/3 cup sugar
4  egg yolks
2 pint strawberries  rinsed, hulled and sl; iced
1  confectioners' sugar  for finishing

PREPARE AND REFRIGERATE tart shell. FOR THE LIME CURD: COMBINE THE
LIME JUICE, butter and sugar in a heavy, non-reactive pan. Place over
low heat and bring to a boil over low heat. Meanwhile, whisk the
yolks in a bowl until liquid. When the lime mixture boils, whisk half
of it into the yolks. Return the remaining lime mixture to a boil and
whisk in the yolk mixture. Whisk constantly until the mixture
thickens and begins to simmer around the edge of the pan, about 2
minutes. Pour the lime curd into a non-reactive bowl, press plastic
wrap against the surface and refrigerate up to 1 week. TO BAKE THE
TART SHELL: PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350F and set a rack in the middle
level. Pierce the dough with a fork at 1-inch intervals. Cut a
14-inch disk of parchment or wax paper and line the dough with it,
making sure it fits flat against the side of the tart shell. Fill
with dried beans or pie weights and bake about 20 minutes, until the
dough appears dull and dry when a corner of the paper is lifted.
Remove the tart shell from the oven, remove the paper containing the
weights, and return the shell to the oven for 5 to 10 minutes longer,
until it is lightly colored. Do not overbake or the shell will be dry
and tough. Cool on a rack. TO ASSEMBLE THE TART: SPREAD THE LIME CURD
evenly in the tart shell. Arrange the strawberry slices, overlapping,
in concentric or straight rows on the lime curd. Sprinkle with
confectioners' sugar immediately before serving.

Strawberry Spiral Pie

pies, crust

1 lb strawberries hulled,washed
1  and drained
1  (about 4 1/2 cups)
2/3 cup strawberry jam
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon quick cooking tapioca
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 cup sugar
1  biscuit dough (check pies
1  pastries)

Preheat the oven to 450, and line the oven floor with foil to catch
any drips. Spread the strawberries on paper towels to dry. In a small
bowl, stir the jam to loosen it. In a saucepan, melt the butter and
keep warm. In a large bowl, whisk together the cornstarch,
tapioca,ginger,cinnamon,nutmeg and sugar.  Halve any very large
berries. Gently toss the berries with the dry ingredients. On a
lightly floured surface, roll out the biscuit dough into a 10x18
rectangle. Square off the corners. Brush the dough lightly with about
half of the melted butter. Using an icing spatula, spread the jam
over the rectangle, leaving a 1/2 inch border on one long side.
Starting at the opposite long side, roll up the dough jelly-roll
fashion and pinch the seam closed. Roll the log so that it is an even
diameter, exactly 18 inches long; turn the log seam side down. Using
a large sharp knife, quarter te log, then cut each quarter into 3
equal pieces so that there will be 12 spiraled biscuits in all. Using
a rubber spatula, fold the strawberry filling once to remix. Spoon
the filling into a 9 inch glass pie plate and smooth the top.
Arrange the pie and the remaining 4 biscuits in the center.  Don't
push the biscuits down into the strawberries. Bake the pie for 20
minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the filling is
bubbling.  Lower the oven temp to 350 loosely cover the pie with foil
and bake for 15 minutes longer. Transfer to a rack to cool for 30
minutes before serving.

Strawberry Super Pie

fruits, pies

      ----CRUST----
3/4 cup butter, sweet; melted
1 1/2 cup flour, all-purpose
1 tablespoon sugar, powdered
3/4 cup pecans; chopped
      ----TOPPING----
2 lb strawberries; divided
1/2 cup ; water
1 cup sugar
3 tablespoon cornstarch
      ----FILLING----
1 1/4 cup whipping cream
1/4 lb cream cheese; softened
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup sugar, powdered

Preheat oven to 375 F.  For crust, mix melted butter with flour,
powdered sugar, and pecans.  Press into a buttered 10" pie plate.
Bake for 25 minutes or until light brown. Allow to cool completely.

Start topping by mashing enough strawberries to make one cup. Cut
tops off remaining strawberries and set aside. Place mashed berries
in a sauce pan and add water. Mix sugar and cornstarch into crushed
berry mixture and bring to a boil on top of stove, stirring. Boil
about one minute or until clear and thickened. Set aside to cool.

For filling, whip cream until stiff.  In another bowl, beat cream
cheese with vanilla and powdered sugar. Carefully fold whipped cream
into cream cheese mixture. Spread in cooled crust and refrigerate.

When crushed berry mixture is cool, pie can be assembled. Stand whole
(or halved, as you like) strawberries on top of cream filling, cut
side down. When entire filling is covered with whole berries,
carefully spoon cooled crushed berry mixture over all. Cream filling
should not be seen between berries. Once the crevices have been
filled, do not overload the pie with the crushed berry mixture, as it
will just drip over the sides. Any left- over crushed berry mixture
is excellent instead of jam on toast or English muffins.

Strawberry-Rhubarb Pie (Prodigy)

fruits, pies, deserts

      ----FLAKY PASTRY DOUGH----
2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup cake flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 cup unsalted butter
5 tablespoon cold water; or more
      ----STRAWBERRYRHUBARB FILLING----
2 pint strawberries
1 1/2 lb fresh rhubarb
1/2 cup water
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup fresh, strained orange juice
2 tablespoon grated orange zest
2 tablespoon orange liqueur
2 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoon butter
      ----EGG WASH----
1  egg yolk
1 pinch salt

FLAKY PASTRY DOUGH: Combine dry ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir
well to mix. Add butter and rub in finely, making sure to leave the
mixture cool and powdery. Stir in half the water, adding more if the
dough is dry and does not come together. Press the dough together
well, form into a disk, wrap and chill. After preparing the filling,
roll less than half the dough on a floured surface and fit it into a
9-inch glass pie pan. Pour in the filling and spread evenly on the
dough. Roll the remaining dough to a 12-inch disk and cut into
1/2-inch strips. Flour a cookie sheet or cake cardboard and arrange
half the strips on it horizontally, about 1/2-inch from each other.
Weave in the other strips vertically, again about 1/2-inch from each
other, to form a woven perpendicular lattice. Chill the lattice until
firm.

STRAWBERRY-RHUBARB FILLING: For the filling, rinse, hull and slice
strawberries. Rinse, string and cut the rhubarb into 2-inch lengths.
Bring the sugar, water, orange juice and zest to a boil in a
saucepan. Add strawberries and rhubarb and return to simmer, stirring
often. Don't overcook. Drain well and reserve 1 cup of the liquid.
Return reserved liquid to boil. Combine the liqueur and cornstarch
smoothly and stir into the boiling liquid, continuing to stir and
cook until clear and thickened. Allow to simmer 1 minute, stirring.
Stir in the drained fruit and the butter. Chill while preparing top
crust.

EGG WASH: Preheat oven to 375F and set a rack at the lowest level.
Whisk the yolk and salt together until liquid. Remove tart and
lattice from refrigerator. Paint lattice with egg wash and slide it
onto the surface of the filling. Trim away extra dough at edge of
pan, pressing the edges of the top crust well against the top edge of
the bottom crust. Bake about 30 minutes, until well colored and
gently bubbling. If top crust does not color sufficiently, place pie
on top rack of oven for 5 minutes. Cool slightly and serve warm or at
room temperature.

Stromboli

pies, italian

1 pkg yeast
2 teaspoon sugar
1/3 cup ; water, warm
4 cup flour
3 tablespoon butter; in pieces
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup ; water, ice, without cubes
1 lb ricotta
1/2 cup parmesan
1/2 lb mozzarella, sliced
1/2 lb pepperoni
2 tablespoon butter; melted
1  sesame seeds

Preheat oven to 200 degrees for 15 minutes and turn off. Combine
yeast, sugar and warm water in a small mixing bowl. Set aside for 5
minutes until foamy.  In the workbowl of a food processor, add flour,
butter pieces and salt. Process for 20 seconds.  Add ice water to
yeast. With the processor running, add yeast-water mixture gradually,
until all of the moisture is absorbed and the dough leaves the side
of the bowl. Process for an additional 60 seconds. Transfer dough
from the workbowl to a large greased mixing bowl. Cover with a
kitchen towel and place in warm off oven. Allow to rise until
doubled, approximately 1 1/2 hours.

Combine the ricotta and Parmesan. Punch down the risen dough and
transfer to a floured rolling surface. With quick, hard strokes, roll
dough into a large rectangle, approximately 1/2 inch thick. Layer
one- half of the mozzarella cheese evenly down the center leaving
approximately three inches of exposed dough on either side. Top with
the ricotta mixture and pepperoni, and the remaining mozzarella.
Overlap the exposed dough over the cheese mixture and pinch well on
all sides to seal.

Transfer to a large cookie sheet, seam side up.  Cover with a kitchen
towel and return to the warmed oven. Allow to rise until doubled,
approximately 45 minutes. Brush loaf with melted butter and sprinkle
with sesame seeds. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes or until
loaf is well browned and hollow sounding when thumped.

Susan Purdy's Butter-Lard Pastry For Tourtiére

pastries, canadian

2 cup flour, all-purpose
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup lard; cut up
1/3 cup butter, unsalted; cut up
5 tablespoon ; water, ice, to 6 t

Sift the flour and salt into the work bowl of a food processor fitted
with a steel blade. Cover the bowl and pulse quickly, turning the
machine on and off two or three times. Uncover the bowl and add the
cut-up lard and butter. Process 5 to 10 seconds until the dough has
the texture of rough cornmeal.

Through the feed tube, add part of the water. Pulse two or three
times. Add remaining liquid and pulse twice or several times,
watching the dough and stopping the instant the dough starts to clump
together. It will still look rough and lumpy. Turn the dough out onto
a piece of wax paper. Lift the opposite corners of the paper and
press on the dough, forming it into a ball. Wrap up the dough and
refrigerate 20 to 30 minutes, or several hours. Divide the dough in
half and use as directed in the Tourtiere recipe.

Susan Purdy's Tourtiére

pies, canadian, pork

      ----EGG GLAZE----
1  egg; beaten lightly
1 tablespoon ; water
      ----FILLING----
1 large onion; chopped
3 tablespoon oil
1  garlic clove; minced
1 1/2 lb pork, raw; trimmed of fat & minced o
1 cup pork gravy
1 lb potato; boiled, peeled & chopped
1 tablespoon celery leaves; chopped (opt)
2 tablespoon parsley; chopped
1/4 teaspoon thyme
1/4 teaspoon rosemary or savory
1/8 teaspoon allspice, ground
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon cloves, ground
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, ground
1 teaspoon salt; or to taste

Roll out half the dough from the Butter-Lard Pastry on a lightly
floured surface to 1/8 inch thickness. Fold in quarters, lift, and
position in a pie plate. Trim a 1/2 inch overhang, brush with the egg
glaze, then refrigerate the pastry-lined pan while you prepare the
filling.

In a frying pan, saut the onion in the oil until transparent. Add the
garlic and saut 1 minute, then add the minced pork. Saut about 3
minutes, then add the veal (if you are using it) and saut until the
meats are browned. Break up any clumps with a wooden spoon. Add about
1/2 cup stock, cover the pan, and simmer about 15 minutes to cook the
meat through. Uncover the frying pan and check the liquid. Remove all
but 2 or 3 tbsp. of the meat juice and stock. Add the potatoes,
celery leaves, parsley, herbs and spices, and stir to blend. Add
salt, taste, and adjust the seasoning. Add, if necessary, just enough
additional gravy or stock to moisten the mixture well without making
it watery.

Spoon the mixture into the prepared pastry shell. Brush some egg
glaze on the overhang of the lower crust. Roll out the top crust on a
lightly floured surface, fold in quarters, lift, and position it over
the pie. Trim a 3/4 inch overhang, then fold the top edge under the
bottom crust overhang and pinch the two together to seal, making a
raised rim all around. Flute the edge as desired.

Bake in the lower third of a preheated 425-degree oven for 15 minutes.
Reduce the heat to 350 degress, raise the pie to the center of the
oven, and continue baking about 45 to 55 minutes longer until golden
brown. Check halfway through the baking time and add a foil edging to
protect the crust from overbrowning if necessary. Cool slightly on a
wire rack, then serve hot or warm.

Per serving: 795 calories, 27 gm protein, 52 gm carbohydrates, 53 gm
fat, 21 gm saturated fat, 171 mg cholesterol, 2179 mg sodium (I
believe this is exclusive of the crust).

Sweet Buttery Tart Crust

pies

1 2/3 cup flour
1/4 cup sugar, very fine
1/2 teaspoon salt
10 tablespoon butter -chilled
2  egg yolks
1 teaspoon vanilla extract cold water

1. Sift flour, sugar and salt into a mixing bowl. Cut chilled sweet
butter into pieces into the bowl. Using your fingertips, rapidly rub
the butter and dry ingredients together until th mixture resembles
course meal. Be careful to use only your fingertips as your palms
will warm the dough.
2. Stir egg yolks, vanilla and water together and add to the flour-
butter mixture and blend in, using a fork. Shape dough into a ball.
This should not take more than 30 to 45 seconds.
3. Place the ball of dough onto a pastry board. With the heel of
your hand, smear about ¬ cup of dough away from you into a 6- to
8-inch smear; repeat until all the dough has been dealt with. Scrape
dough together; re- form into a ball, wrap in wax paper and chill for
2 to 3 hours.
4. Roll out dough between two sheets of wax paper, or use a floured
pastry cloth and floured stockinette on your rolling pin, into a round
large enough to line your pan. Work quickly, as the dough can become
sticky.
5. Line either an 8- or 9-inch false-bottom tart pan with dough,
fitting it loosely into pan and pressing to fit sides. Trim edges 3/4
inch outside top of pan, and fold this edge over into inside, and
press into place with fingers. Chill.
6. Preheat over to 425øF.
7. Line dough in the tart pan with a piece of aluminium foil or wax
paper and fill with raw beans, rice or pastry weights. Bake for 8
minutes. Remove weights and foil. Prick the bottom of the dough with
a fork in several places. For a partially baked shell, return to oven
for 3 to 4 minutes longer. For a fully baked shell, return for 8 to
10 minutes longer, or until edges are light brown. [One 8-inch to
9-inch shell]

Sweet Pastry

pies

1 1/4 cup flour
1/4 cup sugar; granulated
3 1/2 oz butter; unsalted well chilled
1 teaspoon lemon zest; opt
1  egg

can use 7 Tbsp of butter
This pastry is very sticky because of the high fat content, best
made in the food processor. Roll the chilled pieces of butter in the
flour to help reduce the stickiness. Roll it out on two pieces of
Saran wrap, lift the wrap to transfer in the flan pan and peel off.
This pastry is forgiving (can be patched) and is important for Lemon
Tart as a flavour contrast.
Put flour and sugar in food processor bowl and pulse 1-2 times to
aerate. Roll cubes off butter in flour and distribute over flour &
sugar in work bowl. Process briefly till mixture reassembles fine
meal. Drop egg down chute while processor is going. Process briefly
till egg is incorporated. Turn on on Saran Wrap covered surface and
form into ball. Refrigerate for at least an hour. Roll out on Saran
Wrap covered surface. (You may add extra flour although it will
toughen it slightly.) Roll to thickness 1/8" and 3" larger in
diameter than flan tin. Transfer carefully, trim edges and put in
fridge for at least an hour. Preheat oven to 375F oven. When it is at
the right temperature, put pastry lined tin in centre and bake 15
minutes. If browning too much, turn oven down to 325F. Remove form
oven and allow to cool before removing from oven.

pies, pastries, holiday

1 1/2 lb sweet potatoes
1 cup sugar, granulated
12 tablespoon butter, unsalted (or use corn-oil m; argarine)
2  eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1  pie crust, unbaked

Boil potatoes until tender (20-30 minutes).  Drain and peel.

In a blender, put the potatoes, sugar and butter.  Mix up a little, then
add eggs, vanilla and nutmeg. Blend ingredients together well, until
mixture is very smooth. Pour into unbaked pie shell and bake at 375 degrees
F. for 45-55 minutes until filling is set.

NOTES:

*  This is an extremely simple and extremely good pie recipe.  You can even
cheat and use store-bought pie crusts, in which case the whole thing takes
about 5 minutes to put together.  Yield:  Serves 3-8.

*  If you don't want to make your own pie shell, I find that the Pet Ritz
factory pie shells work well.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

Sweet Potato Pie (Ceideburg 2)

pies

1 large sweet potatoes
4 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup milk
3  eggs, separated
1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/8 teaspoon grated nutmeg, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, or to taste
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1  prepared pie crust (see below)
      ----FLAKY PASTRY----
2 cup flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup cold lard or vegetable shortening a; nd
1  cold butter or margarine
3  to 5 tablespoons cold water

In this very accommodating pie, the amount of sweet potato used need
not be exact.

1.  Preheat oven to 375F.  Pare sweet potato, cut in half lengthwise,
then cut each piece once crosswise, and drop into boiling water to
cover. Boil until tender (15 to 20 minutes). Meanwhile, cut butter in
small chunks and place in a medium mixing bowl with sugar.

2.  Drain sweet potato and quickly mash with butter and sugar. While
mixture is still hot, beat until smooth. Beat in milk and egg yolks.
Add salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and vanilla; carefully adjust
spicing to taste.

3.  Using an electric mixer with clean, dry beaters, beat egg whites
in a small bowl until stiff.  Gently fold beaten whites into sweet
potatoes. Pour mixture into pie crust, place on a baking sheet, and
bake for 40 minutes.  Lower heat to 350F and bake until top is medium
brown and crust is golden brown (an additional 5 to 10 minutes).
Serve at room temperature or chilled.

Serves 8.

VARIATION:  For the more familiar, heavier pie filling, omit milk,
and beat whole, unseparated eggs into the sweet potato mixture. Bake
at 375F for 40 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature.

FLAKY PASTRY:

1.  In a large bowl mix flour and salt.  Using a pastry blender or 2
knives, cut in lard and butter until mixture is crumbly and particles
are the size of small dried peas.

2.  Mixing lightly with a fork, sprinkle on water, 1 tablespoon at a
time, until dough begins to cling together. With your hands press
dough into 2 flattened balls of equal size.  Enclose in plastic wrap
to prevent dough from drying out while preparing filling. To avoid
stickiness, refrigerate for up to a day.

3.  Roll out on a lightly floured surface, using short, firm strokes
to achieve uniform thinness, according to recipe directions.

Makes two 9-inch pie crusts.

NOTE:  To prepare in food processor, combine flour and salt in work
bowl. Add lard and butter.  Process, using short on-off bursts, until
coarse crumbs form. Add water through feed tube, 1 tablespoon at a
time, processing until mixture barely clings together.  Use your
hands to press pastry together into 2 smooth balls.

Sweet Potato Pie-Omar The Pieman

pies

3 cup cooked, peeled and
1  mashed sweet potatoes
1  egg
2 tablespoon melted butter
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 cup cream
1  to
3/4 cup cream
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
2 teaspoon vanilla
1  dash salt
1/2 cup sugar
1  to
3/4 cup sugar

Omar the Pieman has been vending pies since 1964 after he left
sailing the high seas as a merchant marine. He and his wife,
Haneefah, decided to provide for their family in a traditional way by
baking delicious homemade pies and cakes.

In August of 1964 Omar left on his first route through the historic
streets of New Orleans' French Quarter. As he went along shouting,
"Pieman, pieman ... delicious, fresh-baked pies," his outgoing and
friendly character, as well as his pies, became known and enjoyed by
French Quarter residents.

In his 20 years of business, Omar the Pieman, has been vending in the
French Quarter, at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, the
Bastille Celebration and now finally from his own little "home, sweet
home" kitchen in The Marketplace. Throughout the week from 9:30 to
5:30 his son, Omar Ibn, delivers trays of velvety smooth pies baked
daily by his mother, Haneefah (the lady behind the scenes). She was
once quoted, "I won't let one pie out of my sight unless the crust
melts in my mouth and the fillings are at their best."

Taken from the sadly out-of-print New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival
Cookbook, copyright 1984. Mix the potatoes with rotary beater until
they are smooth. Then add the other ingredients to the potatoes and
beat for 5 minutes. Pour filling into unbaked 9" pie shell, bake for
40-45 minutes at 350-325. Can also be served with a favorite topping:
hot rum sauce, ice cream or whipped cream. Walt MM Omar At The Market

Sweet Spinach Tart

pies, deserts

1  8-inch unbaked pie pastry shell
2 1/2 lb fresh spinach
1/4 cup white wine
1/2 cup rose water
1/3 cup sugar (or more)
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1 pinch salt (generous)
1  sliced strawberries and confectione; rs' sugar for topping

A Spinnage Tart--Take good store of Spinage, and boyl it in a Pipkin,
with White-Wine, till it be very soft as pap: then take it and strain
it well into a pewter dish, not leaving any part unstrained: then put
to it Rose-water, great store of Sugar and cinamon, and boyl it till
it be as thick as Marmalad.  Then let it coole, and after fill your
Coffin and adorn it....--Gervase Markham, The English Hous-wife

Spinach "was held in special regard because it had reached the western
world much later than the other greenstuff of medieval cookery,"
comments C. Anne Wilson in Food and Drink in Britain. "It came from
Persia, through the Arabs, and was first recorded in the west by St.
Thomas Aquinas. It arrived too late to acquire any traditional
medicinal merits."

Here the Elizabethans treat spinach as a fruit, and with great
success. It is fascinating to note how serendipity thrives among
cooks who have no preconceived notions about the "proper" use of a
particular food.

1.  Bake pie shell at 425F for 10 minutes.  Reduce temperature to
350F and bake for an additional 35 minutes or until done. Let cool.
2. Wash and trim spinach.  Put spinach directly into large enameled
or aluminum pot without draining.  Add wine. 3. Cover and steam
spinach over medium flame for 1-2 minutes or until spinach is wilted.
4. Drain spinach and mince very fine. 5. In the same pot, combine
rose water, sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Bring to a boil, stirring to
dissolve sugar. 6. Add chopped spinach and stir to coat. 7. Simmer
over very low flame, stirring occasionally, until all liquid
evaporates. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. 8. Fill pie shell
with spinach mixture. Arrange sliced strawberries decoratively on
top. 9. Chill at least 2 hours. 10. Just before serving, sprinkle
lightly with confectioners' sugar.

1 1/2 cup half and half
2  eggs
3 cup thinly sliced, green apples  (peele; d)

The Ultimate Lemon Meringue Pie - No Weep

fruits, pies

      ----COOK'S ILLUSTRATED 11/12/94----
1  graham cracker-coated shell
1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
6 tablespoon unsalted chilled butter; cut
1  into 1/4 pieces
6 tablespoon unsalted chilled butter; cut
1  into 1/4 pieces
4 tablespoon all-purpose vegetable
1  shortening; chilled
3 tablespoon to 4 t cold wate
1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs
1  lemon filling:
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup cold water
6 large egg yolks
1 tablespoon zest from 1 lemon
1/2 cup juice from 2 or 3 lemons
2 tablespoon unsalted butter
1  meringue topping:
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 cup sugar
4 large egg whites
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

1.  For the pie shell, mix flour, salt, and sugar in food processor
fitted with steel blade.  Scatter butter pieces over flour mixture,
tossing to coat butter with a little of the flour. Cut butter into
flour with five 1-second pulses.  Add shortening; continue cutting in
until flour is pale yellow and resembles coarse cornmeal with butter
bits no larger than a small pea, about 1-second pulses.  Turn mixture
into medium bowl.

2.  Sprinkle 3 tablespoons cold water over mixture. Using rubber
spatula, fold water into mixture; press down on dough mixtue with
broad side of spatula, fold water into mixture; press down on dough
sticks together. If dough will not come together, add up to 1
tablespoon more cold water. Shape dough into ball, then flatten into
4-inch-wide disk. Dust lightly with flour, wrap in plastic, and
refrigerate for 30 minutes before rolling.

3.  Generously spinkle work area with 2 tablespoons graham cracker
crumbs. Place dough on work area. Scatter a few more crumbs over
dough. Roll dough from center to edges, turning it into a 9-inch
disk, rotating a quarter turn after each stroke and sprinkling
additional crumbs underneath and on top as necessary to coat heavily.
Flip dough over, and continue to roll, but not rotate, to form a
13-inch disk slighly less than 1/8-inch thick.

4. Fold dough in quarters; place dough point in center of 9-inch
Pyrex pie pan.  Unfold to cover pan completely, letting excess dough
drape over pan lip. To fit dough to pan, lift edge of dough with one
hand and press dough in pan bottom with other hand; repeat process
around circumference of pan to ensure dough fits properly and is not
stretched. Trim all around, 1/2-inch past lip of pan. Tuck 1/2 inch
of overhanging dough under so folded edge is flush with lip pan;
press to seal. Press thumb and index finger about 1/2-inch apart
against outside edge of dough, then use index finger or knuckle of
other hand to poke a dent on inside edgeof dough through opening
created by the other fingers. Repeat to flute around perimeter of pie
shell.

5.  Refrigerate until firm, aout 30 minutes. Prick shell at 1/2-inch
intervals; press a doubled 12-inch square of aluminum foil into pie
shell; prick again and refrigerate a least 30 minutes.

6.  Adjust oven rack to lowest position, heat oven to 400 degrees.
Bake, checking occasionally for ballooning, until crust is firmly
set, about 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees, remove
foil, and continue to bake until crust is crisp and rich brown in
color, about 10 minutes longer.

7.  For the Filling, mix first four ingredients in a large,
nonreactivve saucepan.  Bring mixture to simmer over medium heat,
whisking occasionally at beginning of the process and more frequently
as mixture begins to thicken. When mixture starts to simmer and turn
translucent, whisk in egg yolks, two at a time.  Whisk in zest, then
lemon juice, and finally butter. Bring mixture to a good simmer,
whisking constantly. Remove from heat, place plastic wrap directly on
surface of filling to keep hot and prevent skin from forming.

8.  For the meringue, mix cornstarch with 1/3 cup water in small
saucepan; bring to simmer, whisking occasionally at beginning and
more frequently as mixture thickens.  When mixture starts to simmer
and turn translucent, remove from heat.  Leet cool while beating egg
whites.

9.  Heat oven to 325 degrees.  Mix cream of tartar and sugar
together. Beat egg whites and vanilla until frothy. Beat in sugar
mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time; until sugar is incorporated and
mixture forms soft peaks. Add cornstarch mixture, 1 tablespoon at a
time; continue to beat meringue to stiff peaks. Remove plastic from
filling and return to very low heat during last minute or so of
beating meringue (to ensure filling is hot). MM Norma_Wrenn

Tomato & Caramelized Onion Galette

main dish, pies

      ----NORMA WRENN SERVES 1012----
2 1/2 lb yellow onions; coarsely chop
6  fresh thyme sprigs <or>
2 pinch dried thyme
1/4 cup olive oil
1  salt/freshly ground pepper
1 tablespoon fresh rosemary; minced <or>
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1  yeast dough or pie dough
3 oz gorgonzola cheese
1 large large cherry tomatoes or
1  plum tomatoes; sliced cross wise 1/3 thi
1 large egg; beaten

In a large, heavy, nonreactive saucepan, cook the onions and thyme
over moderate heat, stirring once or twice, until the onions start to
turn golden, about 15 minutes.

Add 3 tablespoons of the oil, cover and cook over low heat, scraping
the pan every 10 minutes, until the onions are browned, about 1 hour.
Season with salt and pepper and 2 teaspoons of the fresh rosemary (or
all the dried rosemary).  Let cool.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  On a lightly floured baking sheet
without sides, roll out the galette dough into a 14-inch round.
(Alternatively, divide the dough into 4 even pieces and roll into
8-inch rounds.) Spread the filling over the dough, leaving a 2-inch
border. Crumble the cheese on top and overlap the tomatoes in a ring.
Season with salt and pepper and drizzle on the remaining 1 tablespoon
oil. Fold up and pleat the border of the dough.  Brush the dough with
the egg.

Bake the galette until the crust is golden, about 20 minutes for Yeast
Dough and 35 minutes for Pie Dough. Sprinkle the remaining 1 teaspoon
fresh rosemary over the top and serve hot or warm.

Topsy Turvey Apple Pie

pies

1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 tablespoon melted butter
1 tablespoon corn syrup
1/4 cup pecan or walnut halves
1  crust for 2 crust pie
1  filling for pie:
2/3 cup sugar
2 tablespoon flour
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
4 cup sliced apples
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg

1.  In a 9" pie pan, combine brown sugar, corn syrup and melted butter
and spread evenly over the bottom of the pan. Arrange pecan or
walnut halves over the mixture. Set aside. 2. Make your favorite
pie crust. Take the bottom crust and put it
over the mixture in the pie pan. Heat oven to 425F. 3. In a small
bowl, combine the sliced apples, sugar, nutmeg, flour
and cinnamon; mix well. Arrange the apple/sugar mixture over the
bottom crust of the pie. Top with the top crust. Seal and flute.
Cut slits in several places. 4. Bake at 425F for 8 minutes, and
then reduce heat and continue to
bake at 375F for 25-35 minutes, or until golden brown. It would
be wise to place pie on cookie sheet covered with foil, as it
will run over. 5. While pie is baking, prepare a glaze of 1/2 c
confectioners sugar,
1 tsp vanilla, and enough milk to make into a glaze. This will be
used on the top of the pie when removed from the oven and still
hot. 6. Remove pie from oven; loosen edge of pie. Cover top of
pie with
glaze. While still hot, carefully invert pie onto large serving
plate. Serve warm or cold with whipped cream or ice cream.

COMMENTS:Bake in miniature size and use as an hors d'oeuvre, suggests
the owner of this recipe, who uses muffin pans for his favorite dish
for a December family reunion. To accompany the mini-tourti=8Ares, he
likes home-made tomato-and-peach ketchup and dry red wine. TIP: Add a
pinch or two more herbes and spices. Heat oil in a large, heavy
frying pan and saut=82 ground pork, veal and beef, breaking up meat
until crumbly. Add garlic and onions, and saut=82 until vegetables
are soft. Add beef broth, sage, ba= y leaf, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves,
parsley flakes, dry celery leaves and celery seeds. Cover and simmer
for 20 to 30 minutes. Add brandy and breadcrumbs. Blend in salt and
pepper. Simmer briefly. Mixture should be moist. Cool. Preheat oven
to 425'F.. Line 3 9-inch pie pans with pastry, reserving an equal
amount of the dough for top crusts. Fill each pan with meat mixture.
Cover with pastry, cutting two slits in the center of each pie to
permit steam to escape. Brush each pie with beaten egg. Bake
tourti=8Ares for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350'F. and cook until
crust is golden-brown, about 25 minutes. Serve hot or cool
completely, wrap and freeze. Makes 3 tourti=8Ares. From the MOTREAL

Tujague's Pecan Pie

pies, nuts, cajun

1  9-inch unbaked pie shell
3  eggs
1 cup sugar
2/3 cup dark karo syrup
2 tablespoon butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon armagnac or other brandy
1 1/2 cup pecan halves

(Introduction by Malcolm Hébert)

When the French settled in New Orleans they discovered the pecan. And
they promptly made good use of it by creating pecan brittle, pecan
pralines, pecan sauce and of course pecan pie. The first pecans I
ever ate came from my Grandmother's pecan tree in her backyard. Every
Christmas she would send a 50 pound gunny sack of pecans to my
mother. My Grandmother's pecans were not those tasteless thin shelled
kind; hers had thick shells with just as much shell as meat and 10
times more taste.

This recipe for pecan pie is from my mother's uncle whose family owned
Tujague's restaurant in New Orleans for more than 70 years.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. In a glass mixing bowl beat the eggs,
blending in the sugar, syrup, butter, vanilla, salt, Armagnac and
pecans. Pour the mixture into the pie shell and bake 10 minutes.
Lower the oven to 350 degrees and bake 30 minutes or until a wooden
skewer or knife inserted into the pie comes out clean. Cool on a wire
rack. Serves 6-8. Walt MM

Tyropittakia (Cheese Pies)

appetizers, pies, vegatarian, vegetarian

8 oz feta cheese
2 oz gruyere cheese or cottage
1  cheese (see note)
2  eggs (lightly beaten)
2 tablespoon fresh mint or dill, finely
1  chopped
8  to 10 sheets of fillo pastry
3 oz melted butter
1  oil for greasing

Preheat the oven to 350 F/ 180 C/ gas mark 4.

To make the filling, drain the feta of its salty water and crumble
into a bowl with a fork or fingers. Add the Gruyere/cottage cheese,
eggs and dill/mint to the Feta and mix well.

Cut the whole stack of fillo pastry into 3/4 long strips about 3
inches wide. Brush each sheet with melted butter, place a (quite
heaped) teaspoon of filling at one end (in the corner). Fold over
diagonally to cover and keep folding into triangular pies - making
sure that all sides have as many layers as possible to avoid
spillage. Place the pies on an oiled baking sheet, brush the tops
with butter and bake for 20 minutes or until crisp and light golden.

Good when warm - can keep for a few days in an airtight container.

You could also use more spinach instead of the herbs and decrease the
amount of cheese used proportionally.

(note: Here in the UK Feta is saltier than in Greece so this is why
these ingredients are added)

2 lb grapes, seedless (green), with stem; s removed
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Combine cracker crumbs, about 3 T sugar and
butter.  Reserve 1/4 cup of this crumb mixture and press the rest into a
9-inch pie pan.  Bake at 350 degrees F. for 8 minutes. Allow to cool.

Dissolve cornstarch and about 2/3 cup sugar in cold water in saucepan. Add
grapes and bring to boil, stirring constantly.  Reduce heat and simmer for
5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the lemon juice. Cool.

Spoon this filling into the baked and cooled crust.  Mix sour cream with
about 1 T sugar and vanilla and spread over pie. Sprinkle with reserved
crumbs. Serve.

NOTES:

*  Fruit pie made from green seedless grapes -- This recipe came originally
from the _Los Angeles Times Magazine_.  It's unusual:  I'd never before
thought of using grapes in a pie before.  But it's good!

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate (burns easily).
: Time:  30 minutes.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

Vinegar Pie 4

pies, pastries, deserts

1/4 cup unbleached flour
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 dash salt
4 large egg yellows (yolks)
2 large egg whites
1 cup sugar
1 cup sour cream (commercial)
3 tablespoon melted butter
3 tablespoon cider vinegar
1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts or pecans
1 cup raisins

Prepare an unbaked single pie crust. NOTE: This is a version (Updated
slightly) of a very old recipe.  It was used by many a farmer's wife and
frontier wife to use up sour milk and cream for a dessert. The vinegar is
used to preserve the pie where there was no refrigeration. It is basically
a spice custard pie.

Prepare the pastry and line a 9-inch pie pan.  Chill while making the
filling.

Sift the flour, spices, and salt together and set aside

Beat the egg yellows thoroughly.  Wash and dry the beater, then beat the 2
egg whites until they stand in peaks. Gently fold the sugar into the egg
whites and stir into the yellows. Add the flour mixture alternately with
the sour cream.

Combine the butter, vinegar, nuts, and raisins and stir into the filling.
Pour into the pie shell and bake in a preheated 450 degree F. Oven for 10
minutes.  Reduce the heat to 400 degrees F. and bake 5 minutes. Then turn
the heat down to 350 degrees F. and continue baking for about 15 minutes or
until the filling is set. Cool. May be served with whipped cream, if
desired.

Whistle Stop's Sugar Cream Pie

pies, pastries, deserts

1 1/2 cup brown sugar (do not pack)
6 tablespoon all purpose flour
1 cup half and half
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon vanilla
1  butter
1  cinnamon

Mix together brown sugar and flour and put in bottom of an unbaked deep
dish pie shell. Then mix together Half and half, whipping cream, salt, and
vanilla. Slowly pour this mixture over the top of the brown sugar mixture.
DO NOT STIR!!!!!  Dot with slices of butter and sprinkle with cinnamon.
Bake 10 minutes at 450 degrees. Reduce heat to 325 degrees and bake for 50
minutes. Serve slices of pie slightly warm.

**I have found that baking the pie in a glass pie dish has better results
then using the pie shell already in a aluminum pan.  The aluminum ready pie
crust seems to over cook the brown sugar and make it hard instead of a
gelatin type substance.  Also Vanilla ice cream is a great accompaniment to
the pie. Plus it will help ease some of the kick from the richness of the
pie.

This is the recipe for the locally famous and loved Sugar Cream Pie baked
and served at The Whistle Stop restaurant in Glendale KY

Yeast Pasty Dough

pies

1 1/2 cup warm water
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cup whole wheat flour
2 1/2 cup white flour
1  egg, beaten
1 tablespoon milk (or cream or water)

I love little meat pies of any description.  In the case of samosas,
they don't even have to have meat in 'em. Here's a series of seven
recipes from all over the world for "turnovers".

Dissolve yeast and sugar in 1/2 cup of the warm water. Let stand for
10 minutes until bubbly.  Then stir in remaining warm water 1/3 cup
olive oil, salt and whole-wheat flour. Mix well.

Stir in 2 cups white flour and as much of the rest as needed to make
a soft dough.  Knead well.  Oil the sides of a large bowl with the
remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Put the dough in the bowl and
turn to coat with oil.  Let rise until doubled, 1 hour.  Punch dough
down and let sit for 10 minutes.

Roll dough into 20 x 24-inch rectangle and cut into 4 x 4-inch
squares. Fill with the salmon-rice or other desired filling. Fold
over and seal. Trim excess pastry and decorate top of turnover. Let
rise for 10 minutes. Mix egg and milk (or cream or water) to make an
egg wash and brush it on top of the turnover.  Bake in a 400F oven
for 20 to 25 minutes until golden.

Makes 30 pasties.

Zeppole

pastries, ethnic

2 cup water +
10 oz sugar
3 tablespoon oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
2  bay leaves
2 cup sifted flour
2 tablespoon semolina
4  egg yolks
1/4 cup marsala ( sweet )
1  olive oil
1  powdered sugar

Zeppole comes from the word zeppelin. Zeppole means fried " puffs "
When cooked properly they should be heavenly and so light you might
expect them to float away. this particular version comes from Naples,
Italy.There are many zeppole recipes, this being more of a fried puff
pastry opposed to other zeppole which are more breadlike.

Mix water, sugar, oil and bay leaf in heavy saucepan and bring to a
boil. Mix flour and semolina together and dump into boiling water all
at once. Remove from heat and begin stirring with wooden spoon until
it forms a mass. Return to lowest heat and cook 5 minutes stirring.
Remove from heat, discard bay leaf and add yolks 1 at a time beating
vigorously after each addition. add marsala and beat dough until
satiny. You can use a food processor to prepare this dough if you
wish to make the above steps go faster. Grease a countertop or board
with olive oil and pat down dough into a pancake. Flatten dough and
fold sides over on itself so there are 3 layers. flatten dough again
and repeat folding 5 times more. Take about 1/3 of dough and roll out
to a thickness of your thumb and make each piece into a ring. Make 3
or 4 at a time and slip them into boiling oil. when you turn them,
prick them with a sharp knife or fork in a few places. Drain on brown
paper and serve warm, dusted with confectionery sugar.
