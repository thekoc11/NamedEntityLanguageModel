      Title: Adobo (Smoked Chile Marinade) #1
 Categories: Marinade
      Yield: 1 Cup
 
      8    Cloves of Garlic, unpeeled
      4    Dried chiles Anchos
           -stemmed,seeded,deveined
           -about 2 ounces
      6    Dried chiles Guajillos
           -stemmed,seeded,deveined
           -about 1 1/2 ounces
    1/2    Inch stick cinnamon
           -about 1/2 t ground
      1    Clove, or a pinch ground
     10    Black peppercorns
           -scant 1/4 t ground
      2 lg Bay Leaves broken up
    1/8 ts Cumin seed, or 1/8 t ground
    1/2 ts Dried Oregano
    1/2 ts Dried Thyme
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Cider vinegar
 
   Toasting the chiles and garlic. Roast the garlic cloves on a griddle or
  heavy skillet over medium heat, turning frequently, until blackened in
  spots and VERY soft, about 15 minutes. Remove, cool, skin and roughly chop.
   While the garlic is roasting, tear the chiles into flat pieces and toast
  them a few at a time: Use a metal spatula to press them firmly against the
  hot surface for a few seconds, until they blister, crackle and change
  color, then flip them over and press them flat to toast the other side.
   Soaking the dried chiles. Break the chiles into a small bowl, cover with
  boiling water, weight with a plate to keep submerged and soak 30 minutes.
  Drain, tear into smaller pieces, place in a blender jar and add the garlic.
   Finishing the Adobo. In a mortar or spice grinder, pulverize the cinnamon,
  cloves, peppercorns, bay leaves and cumin. Add the chiles along with the
  oregano, thyme, salt, vinegar and 3 Tb water. With a long series of blender
  pulses, reduce the mixture to a paste. Run the blender for a few seconds
  until the mixture clogs, then scrape down the sides with a spatula and
  stir; repeat a dozen times or more until the mixture is smooth. Don't add
  water unless absolutely necessary or this marinating paste won't do its job
  well. Strain the paste through a medium-mesh sieve into a noncorrosive
  container with a tight-fitting lid. Cover and refrigerate.
   Considerations: After soaking the chiles, they can be put through a foley
  food mill to remove the skins and the seeds. Add this puree along with the
  garlic to the small blender jar and proceed. If this is done, and the
  mixture is put together in a small blender jar, and pulsed, scraped down,
  and mixed very well the final sieving can be eliminated.
   All of the chiles can be Ancho or Guajillo. You can substitute 3 1/2
  ounces of California or New Mexican chiles  for the above chiles but the
  flavor will be light.
   Adobo with powdered chiles: For a darker, stronger tasting adobo made
  without the tedious series of blender runs, roast the chiles and garlic as
  directed above, then pulverize the chiles with the cinnamon,cloves,pepper,
  bay leaves and cumin in several batches in a spice grinder; sift through a
  medium-mesh sieve. Skin the garlic and mash it to a smooth paste. Mix with
  the powdered chile mixture, oregano, thyme, salt, vinegar and 6 Tb water.
  Store as directed above.

      Title: Basturma (Georgian Pomegranate Marinated Grilled Lamb)
 Categories: Asian, Meats, Barbecue, Marinade
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 3/4 lb Boneless leg of lamb
           For the marinade:
      2 c  Fresh pomegranate juice (or
      1 c  Pomegranate syrup)
      1 sm Onion, grated
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/4 c  Extra virgin olive oil
           Freshly ground black pepper
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh cilantro,
           Plus
    1/4 c  For garnish
      1    Bay leaf, crushed
      1 ts Ground coriander
           Freshly ground black pepper
           Salt
           Lemon wedges for serving
 
  From: Nov/Dec issue On The Grill magazine For subscription information,

  In the Republic of Georgia, basturma is a sort of shish kebab (Elsewhere in
  the Near East, the term refers to spiced dried meat and is etymologically
  related to our word pastrami.) Georgians love the combination of fruit and
  meat with pomegranate juice as a common seasoning. If you can't find fresh
  pomegranates, use pomegranate syrup (sometimes called pomegranate
  molasses), which is sold in Middle East and Armenian markets. This recipe
  comes from my friend, Darra Goldstein, author of The Georgian Feast (Harper
  Collins).
  
  Serves 4
  
  Cut the lamb into 1 1/2-inch cubes, trimming off excess fat or sinew.
  (Leave a little fat intact.)
  
  Prepare the marinade.  To juice a fresh pomegranate, cut it in half and
  press it on a citrus reamer.  Strain juice into a large non-reactive bowl.
  Stir in the remaining marinade ingredients.  Add the lamb and marinate for
  at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.
  
  Thread lamb onto skewers and season with salt and pepper.  Build the fire
  and let it die down to embers. Oil the grill.  Rake a 1-inch layer of
  glowing coals beneath it. Generously season the kebabs with salt; grill,
  basting with any excess marinade, until the lamb is cooked to taste, 4 to 6
  minutes per side.  Transfer the kebabs to a platter, sprinkle with the
  remaining cilantro and serve with lemon wedges.

  Source: FOODday, July 9, '91 From: Valerie Whittle
  
  The Berberes are a nomadic tribe in northern Africa.  Fenugreek is a
  rectangle-shaped seed with a pleasantly bitter flavor.  Look for it in
  Indian and Middle Eastern grocery stores.  I have used this marinade with
  great success on tuna, pork tenderloin and sirloin steak.
  
  * Juice of 1 lemon (1/4 cup)
  
  Finely chop onion.  Mince garlic and ginger.  Place onions, garlic, ginger,
  peppercorns, red pepper, coriander, cardamom, fenugreek, cinnamon, cloves,
  allspice, salt and paprika in dry skillet and cook over medium heat 3 to 4
  minutes, or until spices are lightly roasted and fragrant. Combine roasted
  spice mixture, olive oil and lemon juice in blender and puree to smooth
  paste.  Spread paste on meat and marinate overnight. WARNING: A little of
  this spicy mixture goes a long way!
  
  Makes enough marinade for 1 1/2 pounds tuna, pork tenderloin and sirloin
  steak.

    1/2 c  Thinly sliced onion
      2 tb Fresh sage
           -- coarsely chopped
      2 ts Pepper
      1 ts Salt

---------------------------------MAIN DISH---------------------------------
      3    Pork tenderloins

-----------------------------GRILLING MATERIALS-----------------------------
           Charcoal briquettes
      6    Wood chips (up to 8)
           -- preferably fruitwood
 
  Combine all marinade ingredients; blend well.  The marinade for this dish
  can be prepared a day in advance; marinating should go on for 24 hours.
  
  Lay the pork tenderloins in a ceramic or glass dish and pour marinade over
  them.  Turn the tenderloins several times during the 24 hours that they are
  marinating in the refrigerator.  When ready to cook, pat the pork dry.
  
  Preheat charcoal in an outdoor grill and soak the wood chips in water for
  30 minutes.  Add the chips to the hot coals. Roast the pork evenly for
  about 40 minutes, until its internal temperature is 165 F. If pork is to be
  eaten hot, allow it to sit on the edge of the grill for 10 minutes or so
  after it is cooked so that the juices can be drawn back into the meat.
  
  Good served either hot or cold, accompanied by a green tomato chutney.

  Place the dry ingredients in a clean coffee grinder and grind until very
  fine. Place the liquid ingredients in a small saucepan and add the ground
  dry ingredients. Bring to a boil. When it comes to a boil, remove from heat
  and let cool completely . Using a syringe with a large needle, inject the
  turkey every inch or so. Do this 24 hours before cooking. After 24 hours
  you can cook >the turkey how you like, deep fried, smoked, roasted, etc. I
  think the deep fry method is best suited for this marinade.

 Categories: Meats, Sauces, Marinade
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  1/2 Dijon mustard                  1/4 cup plus 1 "shot" Jim Beam 1/4 cup
  soy sauce                  1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar 3 tbs
  Worcestershire sauce         1/3 cup minced scallion 3 cloves garlic,
  minced Directions: Sample whiskey to test for quality. All ingredients
  should be of the finest quality. This is also known as "searing" and keeps
  all the juices in. Stir all ingredients together in a bowl. I use this
  Southern marinade for shellfish like shrimp or scallops, covered at room
  temperature for an hour.  For beef, poultry or pork, cover and chill
  overnight.  Baste the seafood or meat with the marinade as it is grilled.
  Makes about 1-1/2 cups & I usually double the recipe to have plenty of
  sauce for basting.

      Title: Dry Rub Spice Marinade
 Categories: Herbs, Marinade
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Kosher salt
      2 tb Garlic powder
      1 tb Dried thyme
      2 ts Ground black pepper
    1/4 c  Granulated or brown sugar
      2 tb Paprika
      2 ts Cayenne pepper
 
  Combine all ingredients, blending thoroughly. If reserving for later use,
  store in a tightly capped jar. To use, sprinkle heavily over all sides of
  meat and rub in well with fingers. Let meat stand at room temperature for
  two hours, or lightly covered overnight in the refrigerator. Sprinkle meat
  again lightly before grilling, broiling or baking. This recipe makes enough
  for 3-4 pounds spareribs. Mixture is also good on poultry.
  
  Keeps indefinitely in tightly capped jar. Note from the cook:"The secret of
  a good dry rub is equal proportions of kosher salt and sugar. The salt
  draws juices to the surface of the meat; the sugar drinks those juices up,
  making a lovely, light, potently seasoned glaze on the meat.These are the
  herb bottles closest to my hands, if you have other stuff handy, add it as
  you wish: ground ginger, or dry mustard; red pepper flakes, or onion
  powder. Customize it any way you will." Via: RFIX_S 09-28-1994

  Place the garlic, rosemary, oregano, parsley and black pepper in a food

  glass baking dish. (Do not add any salt or acids such as lemon juice or
  vinegar at this time!)  Add the oil and turn the fish a couple of times.
  The fish should be nearly or completely submerged in the oil. For best
  results, the fish should be covered and refrigated overnight. You may also
  marinate it for a few hours.
  
  To cook, pat off the excess oil and lightly salt to taste. Grill, broil, or
  bake to your liking.  Do not over cook! Serve with lemon wedges. The
  leftover herbed oil can be refrigerated for a few day and reused only for
  fresh seafood preparation.

  SAGER To: ALL Subject: PIZZA Flags:
  
  Hi, thought maybe someone out there would like either of my recipes.
  
                        Roast Beef Bar - B - Q  Pizza :
  
    I always use Robin Hood pizza dough mix or you can use your regular dough
  recipe for the crust.
    You'll need 1# of Roast Beef, cut it into small pieces then pour 1 bottle
  of B-B-Q sauce into the meat. After you have the meat well coated then
  spread the mixture onto your pizza crust. You can use whatever cheese you
  like the most, I always use Mozzarella on mine.
  
                        Pierogie Pizza:
    1. Your favorite pizza crust
    2. A mixture of mashed potatoes (I've always used homemade, never tried
  powder yet)
    3. Small can of sauerkraut
    4. Mozzarella and cheddar cheese (I sometimes use 3 cups of cheese
  depending on how much of the potato mix you put on your pizza.)
  
    Use your mixer to mix the sauerkraut into the mashed potatoes.  Then
  spread onto your crust and then add cheese.  You can put as much potatoe
  mix as you want on the pizza just becareful when you cut it the potato mix
  will be very hot!
  
    I hope you enjoy them!!!

      Title: Flavored Vinegars
 Categories: Marinade, Sauces, Salsas
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Flavorings -- such as
      1    Sprig fresh herbs
           Peppercorns
           Fresh chilies
      1    Clove garlic
           Vinegar -- such as
           White- or red-wine
           Cider
           Champagne
           Sherry -- or
           Rice-wine vinegar
 
  Vinegars keep for up to a year. Use good-quality red-wine or white-wine
  vinegar or cider, sherry, champagne or rice-wine vinegar. For vinegar
  containers, I like to recycle attractive bottles. They must be in excellent
  condition, free of chips and cracks.
  
  Sterilize the bottles before using: Wash with hot soapy water and rinse
  well. Place on a wire rack in a large pot and add water to cover the
  bottles; bring to a boil and let boil for 15 minutes.
  
  Transfer the bottles to a clean towel, then use a chopstick or skewer to
  poke desired flavorings into sterilized bottles.  Experiment with different
  combinations and amounts.  Addvinegar to fill, using a funnel. Seal tightly
  with clean new corks, plastic

  refrigerator.  Drain mean and cook, using the method of your choice.
    Note:  The same marinade is also delicious when used with chicken.
    Meat does not have to e immersed completely.  Steak should be turned once
  during the minimum marinating of 2 hours ar room temp. or 4 hours in the
  refrigerator. You can use the same marinade for roasts. Double the amount
  of liquid for 3 to 5 lb. roast and should reach 2/3 the height of the
  roast.  Pierce meat deeply with a skewer 3 or 4 times. After marinating,
  drain off liquid and use if for basting and to make sauce or gravy. BE SURE
  TO BOIL RESERVED MARINADE FOR AT LEAST 3 MINUTES BEFORE USING. Broil or
  grill steaks and hamburgers, or bake hamburgers, allowing 30 minutes at
  350~.

      Title: Jamaican Ribs or Chicken
 Categories: Bbq, Chicken, Marinade, Ribs
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Ribs  or 1 chicken cut up
    3/4 c  Onions; chopped
      4 lg Garlic; minced
           Peppers see directions
      2 tb Allspice
      1 tb Vinegar
      2 tb Salad oil
      1 ts Nutmeg
      1 ts Salt
     12    Bay leaf soaked in hot water
 
  PEPPERS: You can control the heat with the type of peppers you use. Between
  the marinade and the cooking, a lot of the heat will be lost, so dont be
  afraid to throw a couple of whatever hot peppers you have on hand. I use 2
  large cayennes, 2-4 chilies, and a token jalapeno. The preperation: combine
  everything except the bay leafs and the meat in a large zip lock ba Add
  meat and thouroughly mix. Let marinate in the fridge at least 2 hours
  preferably until the next day. Fire up the bbq. Remove meat fromthe bag
  wiuth as much as the marinade as possible still clinging to it. Place half
  of the bay leafs on the meat. Dum the remaining marinade or use it as
  insect repellant. Cook very slowly over medium heat turning often. If your
  grill has a vented hood close it . Do no let meat burn. Cover and cook
  about 1/2 hour. After 1/2 hour remove the bay leaf, turn meat, place the
  remaining bay leav on the meat and cook till done (About 1/2-3/4 hours more
  depending on the heat). Eat. Break out the beer. You'll need it.

      Title: Jerk Paste
 Categories: Caribbean, Marinade, Bbq
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Onion; finely chopped
    1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
    1/2 c  Finely chopped scallions
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
      2 ts Fresh thyme leaves
      6    Habanero chiles
      2 ts Salt
      1 ts Black pepper
      1 ts Allspice
 
  Recipe by: romero@minerva.cis.yale.edu (C. Antonio Romero) From:
  rec.food.cooking. Since there were numerous requests in my mailbox today
  for the jerk recipe, I thought I'd just go ahead and post it.
  
  I started with recipes from "Jerk: Barbecue from Jamaica" by Helen
  Willinsky-- which seems to be a reasonable cookbook, though I haven't tried
  many of their recipes beyond the jerk marinades and jerk chicken. I've made
  some modifications of my own which I'll note as I go.
  
  Jerk seasoning can be made two ways: one is a marinade, one is a paste
  (more authentic, sez Willinsky) Mix all ingredients to form a paste (use a
  food processor).
  
  The recipe as I have been doing it lately uses dried habaneros (all I could
  find around here) and instead of the onion, a cup to a cup and a half of
  scallions including the bottom part (I think I used two bunches of six
  not-very-large scallions each; trim the little roots and the scraggly bit
  at the top of the stalk). Looks and smells just like the Jamaican Country
  Style jerk in the bottle. I also add a little soy sauce for color, and a
  generous shot of cream sherry-- seems to go well in the paste; I think the
  sweetness works well with the allspice.
  
  Jalapenos cannot be substituted-- the result will be MILD, I kid you not (I
  learned this the hard way the first time I tried to make jerk chicken for
  guests and couldn't get habaneros).

      Title: Jim's Teriyaki Marinade & Bbq Sauce
 Categories: Bbq, Japanese, Sauces, Marinade
      Yield: 2 Cups
 
      1 c  Soy Sauce
      1 c  Water
      2 tb Vinegar
      2 tb Brown Sugar
      1 ts Dry Mustard
    1/2 ts Powdered Ginger
    1/2 ts Garlic Powder
      1 ts Hot Pepper Sauce, opt'l
      2 tb Corn Starch
 
  Whisk together all the ingredients except the corn starch. Marinade the
  meat long enough to flavor and tenderize- 1 hr for young chicken breasts or
  fish, overnight for round steak and up to 5 days for some game cuts.
  
  BBQ and baste with the marinade. Make a slurry of the starch and a little
  water and whisk into the marinade. Bring to a boil, stirring as the sauce
  thickens. Serve with the BBQ'd meat.
  
  Real garlic and ginger only improves this dish. The amount of pepper sauce
  can be varied from mild to fiery. You can substitute wine, sherry, orange
  or pineapple juice for some or all of the water to vary the flavor.
  Pineapple juice has an enzyme that provides additional tenderizing power to
  the vinegar and mustard. From: "Wendy Lockman" <wlockman@ra1.Randate: Fri,

 Categories: Sauces, Marinade
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
           -Jollie Ollie
           ***JUICES***
      2    Lemons; juice of
      2    Oranges; juice of
      1    Grapefruit; juice of
           Cherry juice to taste
           Dill Pickle Juice; to taste
    1/2 oz Worcestershire Sauce
    1/2 oz Teriyaki Sauce
      1 tb Mustard
      1 tb Ketchup
           ****SPICES***
        pn Tarragon
        pn Thyme
        pn Sweet Basil
        pn Sage
        pn Coriander
        pn Mace
     10    Fennel Seeds
        pn Rosemary
        pn Oregano
        pn Cumin
        pn Chervil
 
  Put juices into mixer and add spices.  Mix till a bit foamy. Then taste, if
  too tart, use honey to make it almost sweet. It should be slightly tart.
  
  Now put cut up meat and marinade in marinade pan and let stand in room temp
  for an hour.  Then put in refrigerator overnight.
  
  When ready to cook, I use the broiler, or make shish kabobs. But I really
  like it broiled in all the juice. At this point of cooking when meat is not
  pink I usually add a bit of honey over the meat so that the broiler just
  cooks it a bit more.
  
  Now with mashed potatoes and asparagus spears it's a meal fit for a king.
  The left over juice and meat (if there is any left) I generally heat in the
  microwave till hot, then pour it into a plate and just sop up the juice
  with buttered bread and just the meat, no potatoes or veggies. It tastes
  even better when it's reheated, because all the juices and spices have had
  a chance to marry into a fantastic taste extraordinaire.

      3 tb Liquid smoke marinade
           (we used Figaro's)
      3 tb Worcestershire sauce
      1    Serrano pepper, seeded
           And cut into fine slivers
      3    The white part of 2-3

           -fine slivers
           Lots of paprika, lemon
           Pepper for a barbecue rub
 
  Marinate the brisket in a mixture of the liquid smoke and Worcestershire
  sauce for 2-3 hours.  Remove from the marinade, and cut slits all over the
  exterior of the meat.  Insert slivers of onion and serrano pepper in the
  slits.
  
  Cover the brisket with a VERY liberal coating of paprika and lemon pepper.
  Wrap securely in heavy duty aluminum foil (use a drug-store wrap to prevent
  leakage).
  
  Place the brisket in an ovenproof rimmed dish (we used our trusty cast iron
  skillet) and place in a preheated 250 degree (F) oven for at least 16
  hours.
  
  After the first 12-14 hours, you may unwrap the brisket briefly, and ladle
  out some of the accumulated juices for use in your own homemade barbecue
  sauce.

      Title: Lemon and Thyme Marinade
 Categories: Marinade, Chicken, French
      Yield: 14 Servings
 
      2 tb Strained fresh lemon juice
      2 ts Chopped fresh thyme, OR 3/4
           -tsp dried, crumbled
      2 tb Olive oil OR vegetable oil
 
  This is a tangy marinade, containing equal amounts of lemon juice and oil,
  and is good for rich meats like chicken thighs. It can be used for chicken
  breasts too, but their skin should be on for additional protection during
  grilling or broiling.  Thyme gives this marinade a flavor loved in France,
  but you can substitute oregano for an Italian or Greek accent, or mint or
  cilantro for a Lebanese touch.
  
  Mix ingredients in a small bowl.
  
  Makes about 1/4 cup, enough for about 1 1/2 to 2 lbs poultry.

           -tbsp. dried
 
  Freshly ground black pepper,to taste Garnish: lemon peel strips,optional
  
  Place chicken pieces in a glass or ceramic bowl. Mix marinade ingredients
  until smooth and well blended. Reserve 1/3 cup, covered and refrigerated,
  for basting while grilling. Pour remaining marinade over chicken, turning
  pieces to coat completely. Marinade, covered for 6 to 8 hours or overnight,
  turning occasionally. Remove chicken from refrigerator 20 to 30 minutes
  before you are ready to grill, leaving container covered. When coals are
  covered with gray ash, oil the grill rack. Cook chicken, skin side down
  first, for about 15 minutes on each side, brushing with the reserved
  marinade. Watch carefully, as uncovered grills will cook the exteriors
  faster than a covered grill. Pieces are done when exterior is golden brown
  and clear juices run when the chicken is pierced with a sharp fork. Discard
  any unused marinade. Garnish with strips of lemon peel, if desired. Total
  cooking time 30 minutes.
  
  Serves 6.

      1 c  Olive or peanut oil
      3 tb Poupon mustard

  Mix all of the ingredients really well and then pour over whole beef
  brisket.  Let marinate for several hours, or overnight if possible. Also,
  use this marinade as a basting sauce. Some people may find Justin's 3 cups
  of dry red wine a little bit too much for their taste. No problem, use as
  much as you like in the sauce, and drink the rest. Sure won't go to waste.

      1 x  Or:
      2 tb Soy sauce
      1 x  Coarsely ground pepper

    1/2 c  Sherry vinegar

  "... Ingredients in a marinade can be varied, but it is important to use
  wine, vinegar, lemon juice, or some acidic liquid to break down the
  connective tissues.  This process will make the steak more tender.
  Remaining marinade ingredients add flavor." Use a good-quality olive oil or
  walnut oil; add good-quality wine or vinegar and a combination of fresh and
  dried herbs, seasonings, garlic and soy sauce to make a flavorful marinade.
  1.  Place all ingredients in glass screw-top jar; shake vigorously. Arrange
  meat in shallow glass dish; pierce with a fork. Pour marinade over meat;
  turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate several hours or overnight, turning
  meat occasionally. 2.  Remove meat from marinade; pat dry. Remove any
  pieces of spices or herbs that may stick to meat. This recipe is a steak
  marinade, but the ingredients can be adapted for other meats using the same
  techniques.

  absorb the last of  the oil.  Add the whole carrots, brandy, and herbs. Cut
  the zest from the orange and squeeze a little orange juice and add this and
  the zest to the sauce. Season the sauce with a little salt and pepper. Pour
  over the meat and onions, cover the casserole. Cook in the center of a slow

  particularly good when served with spaghetti, macaroni, or noodles, topped

      Presented by: Zarella Martinez, L.A. Times article, "Home Ground",
  10/6/94, page H16. "The ricado used in this dish is the basis for many
  Yucatan peninsula dishes. The most famous is cochinita pibil; a suckling
  pig, marinated with this spice paste and wrapped in banana leaves, baked in
  a Mayan earth oven called a pib. Large fish and venison or other wild game
  are also baked in pibs. I slather this paste on guinea hens and broil them
  on the rotisserie, or wrap marinated chicken breasts or fish fillets in
  banana leaves with slices of orange and steam the packets. One of my
  favorite appetizers is chicken drummettes baked with this recado.
      "... Quintana Roo oregano comes from a tree, not a shrub, and the long
  leaves turn black when they dry. Mexican oregano can be substituted for
  it."

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Pork filet or
           Boned pork loin
      1 md Onion; rough chop
      1 ea Clove garlic
      1 ts Fresh ginger; chop
      3 tb Tamarind liquid =OR=
      3 tb Lemon juice
      2 tb Dark soy sauce
      1 tb Sambal ulek =OR=
      2 ea Fresh red chile; seed & chop
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Palm sugar =OR=
      1 ts Dark brown sugar
      2 tb Peanut oil
 
  Soak bamboo skewers in water for a few hours before threading meat on them
  for grilling.  This helps prevent the ends of the skewers burning.
  
  Ask butcher to remove rind from pork loin.  Cut pork into small cubes about
  3/4 inch square.  Put onion, garlic, ginger, tamarind liquid, soy sauce,
  sambal ulek or chiles, salt and sugar into blender container and blend
  until smooth.  Pour into a bowl, stir in oil, then add cubed pork and stir
  until all the pieces are well coated with marinade. Leave for at least one
  hour or longer in the refrigerator.
  
  Thread on skewers 5 or 6 pieces, not pushed too close together and leaving
  a few inches on end of skewer for holding.  Leaving space between pieces
  enables them to cook more evenly, and pork must be well cooked. Grill over
  glowing coals or under preheated griller for 6 or 7 minutes on each side or
  until pork is well cooked through and brown on all sides. Do not put too
  close to source of heat or outside will be brown before pork is cooked
  through.

      1 tb Palm sugar =OR=
      1 tb Dark brown sugar
      1 ea Clove garlic; crushed

      2 tb Tamarind liquid =OR=
      2 tb Lemon juice
      2 ts Sambal bajak
      3 tb To 4 water
 
  Cut beef or pork into 3/4 inch cubes.  Thread 4-5 cubes on each bamboo
  skewer, not pushing them too close together.  If skewers have been soaked
  in cold water for an hour or so beforehand, it prevents them burning when
  satay is cooked.  Combine sugar with garlic, salt, soy sauce, oil and
  cumin.  Stir until sugar dissolves.  Pour into a long shallow dish and put
  satay in the marinade, turning each one so the marinade coats the meat.
  Cover and refrigerate for a few hours.
  
  Cook over glowing coals or under a hot grill for approximately 15 minutes,
  not too close to the source of heat for pork must be well done; even beef
  is always well cooked, never rare, in satay.  Turn skewers every 5 minutes,
  and brush with marinade.  Serve hot accompanied with satay sauce.
  
  Satay Sauce: Combine all ingredients and serve in a bowl. The sauce is
  spooned over the satay before eating.

      Title: Sun-Dried Tomato and Roasted Garlic Pesto
 Categories: Sauces, Marinade, Spreads, Pastas, Poultry
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Whole head
      3 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
      1 c  Sun-dried tomatoes (see
           Note)
    1/3 c  Fresh flat-leaf (Italian)
           Parsley sprigs
      2 tb Chopped garlic chives or
           Scallion tops
      2 tb Unsalted pistachios or pine
           Nuts
      2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
           Cheese
           Garlic
 
  Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Slice the top off the head of garlic and place
  the garlic in a small baking dish. Rub it with 2 teaspoons of the olive
  oil. Bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until soft. Allow to cool, then squeeze the
  garlic puree from its papery wrapper into a blender container or the bowl
  of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Add tomatoes, parsley,
  garlic chives (or scallion tops) and nuts. Process until finely minced. Add
  remaining oil (2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon) and cheese, and process until
  blended. Transfer to a small bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and
  refrigerate. Keeps a week or longer. Serve on toasted Italian bread, on
  pasta, spooned on frittatas, or with chili, enchiladas or tamales. Note:
  Dried tomatoes are available in several styles: moist, like dried apricots;
  brittle and dark-red; and packed in olive oil. Moist-style are preferred
  here. If you can only find the brittle type, soak them in warm water for a
  few minutes before using or place in a bowl, cover with water, and heat in
  microwave from 30 to 60 seconds. Yield: 1 cup.

  This cinnamon-orange marinade, characteristic of Balkan cooking, is a
  specialty of Georgia in south-central Russia.  The tabaka marinade is
  usually used with chicken and game hen, but it also goes nicely with
  swordfish.
  
  Remove zest of 1 orange and the lemon.  (This is best done using a
  vegetable peeler.  Be sure to take only the zest, not bitter white pith
  beneath it.)  Juice oranges, lemon and limes.  Combine juice and zest in
  bowl. Peel and mince garlic and ginger root. Finely chop onion. Add garlic,
  ginger and onion to citrus juices along with cinnamon, paprika, sugar,
  salt, black pepper, nutmeg, wine and oil.  Whisk to mix. Makes enough
  marinade for 1 1/2 pounds chicken, game hens and swordfish.

      Title: Tandoori Marinade for Chicken
 Categories: Chicken, Marinade
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    Cloves garlic
      1 tb Chopped fresh ginger root
      1 ts Ground roasted cumin seeds
    1/2 ts Ground cardamom
    1/2 ts Red pepper
      1 ts Tandoori coloring (or
           -paprika)
    1/3 c  Plain yogurt
 
  If you left out the yogurt, you'd have a reasonably dry marinade.  Julie
  also calls for using unseasoned meat tenderizer & lemon juice on the
  chicken before the above marinade is applied. Hope all of this is of some
  help.

      Title: Tarragon Lamb
 Categories: Meats, Main dish, Marinade
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 lb Leg of lamb
    2/3 c  Cream
      1 t  Tarragon
  1 1/4 c  Dry white wine
      1 T  Oil
      1 x  Salt and pepper to taste
      1 ea Onion sliced
 
  Skin  the  leg of lamb and trim away all the outside fat and as much of the
  fat lying between the muscle tissue that you can reach. Score the flesh
  deeply with a criss-cross pattern and stuff the slits with the tarragon.
  Rub the meat with the oil and cover with the onion. Place in a suitable
  dish for marinating and pour over the white wine. Add a little salt and
  pepper and leave to marinate for about 2 hours in a cool place, basting
  occasionally.  Roast the lamb with the marinade, basting it frequently, in
  a warm oven 325 deg F until done.
   About 10 minutes before the meat is cooked,  pour off the marinade and
  meat juices into a saucepan. Reduce the gravy to half its original quantity
  by  boiling vigorously. Carve the meat into thin slices and add the
  resulting juices to the marinade. Arrange the meat on a serving dish and
  keep warm.   Remove the gravy from the heat, stir in cream and carefully
  re- heat the sauce until it forms a medium-thick consistency. Pour the
  sauce over the lamb and keep warm.

      Title: Thanksgiving Turkey Marinade - Dkp
 Categories: Marinade, Poultry, Holidays
      Yield: 1 Marinade
 
           See recipe
 
  Thaw turkey (if frozen) on Monday & Tuesday in refrigerator.
  
  On Wednesday, put 3 onions (cut up), 4 garlic cloves (sliced) and 1 large
  bunch of parsley in cavity of bird.
  
  Pour Vernors (ginger ale) and 8 oz orange juice concentrate in cavity.
  Cover and rub bird with Catalina dressing. Sprinkle with seasoned salt and
  pepper and paprika.  I put the whole mess in a garbage bag and marinate it
  overnight.
  
  Before baking, discard all marinade.
  
  Di Note:  When I finally bought my house, I wanted to have Thanksgiving
  here instead of at my mother's (which was traditional). I had NEVER done a
  turkey before. I bought this HUGE creature and started to do the marinade
  thing (my Mom's recipe).  Well, I don't have much counter space and this
  bird was a slipping an' sliding all over the place and I was laughing
  hysterically.  I was actually fighting this monster! My Mom called to see
  how everything was going and all she could hear was me cackeling. She
  jumped in her car and came over and here I was, on the floor with this damn
  bird in my lap and marinade all over me. It was one of those
  moments...great marinade tho!

      6 c  Light soup stock

      1    Bay leaf
      1 ts Minced fresh parsley or dill
    1/2 ts Sweet paprika
 
  Mince onions and saute in fat until light golden; do ot let them brown. Set
  aside. In the same skillet, add cubed beef and brown lightly on all sides.
  Add paprika and blend well. Heat soup stock and add browned beef and
  onions. Cover tightly and cook gently over medium heat until meat is
  fork-tender, about 2 hours. Then add all the vegetables, caraway seeds, and
  parsley sprigs. Season with salt and pepper. Add bay leaf. Cover and simmer
  gently over low heat until the vegetables are tender. Discard parsley
  sprigs and bay leaf. Sprinkle with minced fresh parsley or dill. Prepare
  your favorite dumplings; add them to soup about 15 minutes before serving.
  NOTE from Jolie: The popularity of Goulash in the Hungarian home is well
  known. By the addition of more meat cubes this hearty Goulash Soup may be
  served as a main dish. You may vary the flavor by adding favorite
  seasonings. Gutes aus Ungarn means Something Good from Hungary and Scharf
  means HOT (as in spicy). I have a Hungarian Goulash Soup recipe for you by
  Jolie Gabor (yes, the Gabor sisters' mother) <G> I haven't personally tried
  this recipe, but am posting it here for your perusal... Enjoy! Rita in

  Mix well. Marinate meat for a minimum of four hours.
  
  Here is the absolute best meat marinade I have ever had...I found it in
  "Delicious Decisions" the cookbook of the Jr. League of San Diego. I find
  that very, very inexpensive London Broil (even bottom round & shoulder) is
  almost butter tender when marinaded in this overnight then grilled
  (although broiling is almost as good). Slice thin across the grain & you'll
  surely impress guests! From goober273@aol.com Sat Apr 20 05:07:26 1996
