  hour, then drain. Add 4 cups fresh water and salt, and bring to a boil.
  Cook, covered, at a simmer until the grains are swollen and tender, but
  still chewy, about 30 to 35 minutes. Pour the cooked rice into a colander
  and let it drain briefly. While the rice is cooking, toast the hazelnuts in
  the oven, 7 to 10 minutes, or until they smell toasty. Let them cool a few
  minutes; then rub them in a small kitchen towel to remove most of the
  skins. Don't worry about any flecks of skins that won't come off. Roughly
  chop the hazelnuts, leaving the pieces fairly large. Rinse the currants in
  warm water and squeeze them dry; then cover them with the orange juice and
  let them soak until needed. Prepare the vinaigrette. Add the soaked
  currants and the fennel to the warm rice, and toss with the dressing. Just
  before serving, cut the apple into small pieces, add it to the rice, along
  with the hazelnuts, and toss. Season with freshly ground black pepper, and
  additional salt, if needed, and serve.

           -OR-
      1 ts Salt
    3/4    Stick butter or
           -margarine
      4 lg Eggs
      2 c  Milk
      1    Beef bouillon cube
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
 
  1. Place the rice, water, and half of the salt in a small saucepan and
  bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer
  until the rice is tender, about 45 minutes. Drain off any remaining water.
  Cool to room temperature. [The wild rice may be prepared ahead of time and
  refrigerated overnight if desired.] 2. While the rice is cooking, beat the
  eggs until frothy in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer. Beat in
  the milk, flour, and the remaining half of the salt. The batter will be
  slightly lumpy. [The batter may be refrigerated overnight, if desired.] 3.
  Preheat the oven to 450 F. Stir the rice into the batter. Place the butter
  or margarine in a 9 x 13-inch glass casserole (for each basic recipe for
  ten) and place the casserole in the oven until the butter is melted. Remove
  from the oven and stir in the bouillon cube and the Worcestershire sauce
  until dissolved. Return the casserole to the oven and leave until sizzling.
  Pour the wild-rice batter into the casserole and bake in the center of the
  oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until puffed and golden. 4. Cut into squares
  and serve immediately.

      Title: MIXED GRAIN MUSHROOM CASSEROLE
 Categories: Side dish, Main dish, Casseroles, Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 servings
 
    1/2 c  Wild rice
    1/2 c  Pearl barley
    1/2 c  Brown rice
    1/4 c  Oil
      1 lg Onion; thinly sliced
      4    Garlic cloves; chopped
      4 tb Unsalted butter or margarine
           -OR- Oil
    1/2 lb Mushrooms; thickly sliced
  3 1/2 c  Broth
      1 ts Crushed dried thyme
    1/2 ts Crushed dried oregano
           Salt & pepper; to taste
 
  Combine grains in a mixing bowl and set aside. Pour the oil into a 2-3 qt.
  casserole which is safe for both stovetop and oven cooking, and place on
  med. heat. When hot , saute onion and garlic until tender and translucent,
  about 5-6 mins. Add the mixed grains and saute for 1 min., stirring
  constantly.
  
  Meanwhile melt butter or margarine (if using) in a separate pan on med.
  high heat. When hot , add mushrooms and saute quickly, stirring frequently,
  until the shrooms are hot and have just absorbed the "butter" (about 1
  min.). Immediately remove from heat.
  
  Add the broth, herbs, and mushrooms to the casserole with the onions and
  grains, and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper to taste, cover
  tightly (use aluminum foil between pot and cover if necessary for a good
  seal), and bake at 350 degrees F for 1 hr.
  
  NOTES: I use alot less oil (only as much as needed to keep things from
  sticking in my cast-iron dutch oven), add hot peppers and fresh herbs
  (rosemary is especially delicious; i dislike dried oregano so i use less or
  none), add soy sauce instead of salt, and saute the mushrooms first in the
  same pan (taking them out when done) so i dont have to wash two pans
  :^>. Frankly i can't see where they get 8 servings from, this lasts me
  maybe 3 meals....It's really a hearty dish, so save it for a cold day (some
  of us still have a few left, despite the advent of spring). Enjoy!
  
  (8 servings as a side dish, less as an entree)

    1/4 c  Tahini
    3/4 c  Plain yogurt or soft tofu
    1/4 c  Orange juice
      2 ts Ground cumin
      2 ts Paprika
      2 tb Minced fresh cilantro (opt.)

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      1 tb Unsalted butter
           -OR- avocado oil
      1 md Red onion; chopped
      1 c  Brown and wild rice blend
           -- (uncooked)
           -OR 1/3 brown & 2/3 wildrice
      2 c  Vegetable broth or water
      1 c  Chickpeas; cooked, drained
    1/4 c  Raisins

----------------------------------ORANGES----------------------------------
      2    Jumbo navel oranges
           -- halved crosswise

----------------------------------GARNISH----------------------------------
      1 tb Sesame seeds
      1 tb Chopped scallion whites
      4    Cilantro leaves (optional)
 
  FOR THE ORANGE-TAHINI SAUCE:  In a blender or food processor, combine all
  ingredients.  Refrigerate until ready to use.
  
  FOR THE FILLING:  Melt the butter or heat the oil in a medium saucepan.
  Saute the onion until soft, about 10 minutes.  Add the rice and stir to
  coat with the butter.  Add the broth, bring to a boil, cover, and simmer
  over low heat until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 45
  minutes.  Let cool to room temperature.
  
  In a large bowl, toss together the cooked rice, Orange-Tahini Sauce,
  chickpeas, and raisins.
  
  Prepare the oranges for stuffing by slicing off the rounded ends so that
  each half stands squarely on a plate.  Using a paring knife, carve out the
  fruit, cut it into bite-size sections, and toss it into the rice mixture.
  Once the fruit has been removed, cut away as much of the white portion of
  the peel as possible, leaving the shell intact.
  
  Set the orange shells on a serving dish and fill them with the rice
  mixture.  Garnish each with a sprinkling of sesame seeds and scallions
  topped with a whole cilantro leaf.

      Title: WILD RICE WITH CHESTNUTS
 Categories: Vegetarian, Rice
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 tb Oil
      5 md Shallots
           - peeled and finely chopped
      2    Celery ribs; finely chopped
      1 c  Wild rice; rinsed
    1/3 c  Dried, peeled chestnuts
    1/4 c  Dried currants
      2 ts Aniseed
    1/4 ts Sea salt; or to taste
      4 c  Water
      1 ts Finely chopped orange zest
           -OR- grated
 
  PRESSURE COOKER: Heat the oil in the cooker.  Add the shallots and celery
  and cook, stirring frequently, until softened slightly, about 1 minute.
  Stir in the rice, chestnuts, currants, aniseed, salt, and water.
  
  Lock the lid in place and over high heat bring to high pressure.  Lower the
  heat just enough to maintain high pressure and cook for 25 minutes. Allow
  the pressure to come down naturally or use a quick release method. Remove
  the lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess steam to escape. If
  the rice or chestnuts are not quite cooked, return to high pressure for a
  few minutes.
  
  Drain (reserving the liquid for stock) and return to the pot.  Cover and
  let steam over low heat for a few minutes to dry out.  Fluff up as you stir
  in the orange peel.  Break up chestnuts into 2 to 3 pieces with a fork, if
  desired.
  
  STANDARD STOVETOP: Soak the chestnuts overnight.  Drain and reserve the
  water.  In a heavy 2-quart saucepan, heat the oil.  Add the shallots and
  celery and saute for 1 minute.  Add the chestnut soaking liqiud plus enough
  water to equal 3 cups and bring to a boil.  Stir in the rice, reserved
  chestnuts, currants, aniseed, and salt.  Return to the boil, cover, reduce
  heat, and simmer until most of the grains have butterflied and almost all
  the liquid has been absorbed, about 50 minutes.  Let stand, covered, off
  heat for 10 minutes.  If there is still liquid left in the bottom of the
  pot, lift out the rice with a slotted spoon.

  1 1/2 c  Water
      1 c  Soy milk

      2 c  Flour
    1/2    Garbanzo flour

----------------------------------STUFFING----------------------------------
    3/4 c  Wild rice, uncooked
  2 3/4 c  Stock
    1/4 md Onion; minced
      2 sm Stalks celery; sliced thin
      2 tb Unrefined corn oil
    3/4 md Onion; chopped coarse
    1/4 lb Button mushrooms
           - sliced thick
      6    Shiitake
           - fresh or reconstitued,
           - quartered or eighthed
    1/2    Oyster mushrooms
           -OR- chanrerelles mushrooms
           -If using oysters, separate
           -them into small clumps,
           -if using chanterelles,
           -halve them
      1 lg Tomato; chopped
    1/2 ts Powdered sage
      1 pn Powdered thyme
      1 tb Shoyu
           Salt and pepper; to taste

-----------------------------NUTTY ALMOND SAUCE-----------------------------
      3 tb Unrefined corn oil
           -OR- soy margarine
      4 tb Unbleached flour
  2 1/2 c  Soy milk; heated
    1/2 c  Almonds
    1/4 md Onion; separated into leaves
      4    Cloves
           White pepper; to taste
      3 ds Freshly grated nutmeg
           Salt; to taste
 
  FOR CREPES: Blend the egg replacer w/1/2C water until smooth.  Add
  remaining ingredients and blend one minute at high speed.
  
  Heat a crepe pan or non stick 8" skillet over low heat, brush the bottom
  lightly w/oil (I use unrefined corn oil).  When pan is heated, take it off
  the burner, let cool about three seconds and pour 3-4T batter into it.
  Swirl the pan so the bottom is coated w/a thin layer of batter.  Put the
  pan back on the burner and cook until lightly browned.  Flip the crepe and
  cook until that side is lightly browned as well.  Repeat w/remaining
  batter.  This makes about a dozen crepes.  Note that you will inevitably
  screw up the first crepe or two, but it will become fairly routine after
  that.  Don't worry about it, I still do that after all these years.
  
  FOR STUFFING: Saute the onion in a little dry white wine for a minute or
  two, then add wild rice and stock, cover tightly, bring to a boil, turn
  heat to low and cook about an hour, until all liquid is absorbed.
  
  While the rice cooks, saute celery in oil until slightly tender, add onions
  and all mushrooms, and saute until all vegs are medium tender. Add cooked
  rice, tomato and seasoning and cook another ten minutes or so. Fill crepes
  w/the mixture, roll them over it and heat in a preheated oven at 350 for
  about ten minutes.
  
  Serve w/Nutty Almond Sauce and garnish w/parsley and a twisted orange
  slice.
  
  FOR NUTTY ALMOND SAUCE: Toast almonds until golden, then pulverize. (Don't
  overgrind or you'll get almond butter.)
  
  Heat oil a few minutes in a heavy bottomed skillet, then stir in flour and
  cook 2-3 minutes on low, until fragrant.  Stir in soy milk and continue to
  stir until it begins to thicken, then stir in seasonings. Cover and cook 10
  more minutes, but stir often to prevent scorching. Stir in almonds and cook
  another 4-5 minutes.
  
  Serve w/a simple spinach salad w/mustard vinaigrette and French bread,
  along w/a chilled white wine.

  Melt the butter with the oil in a heavy skillet or large saucepan and saute
  the onion until soft.  Add the rice and cook, stirring often, until
  slightly colored.  Add the walnuts, cook for 5 minutes, then add the
  celery, and cook until the rice is golden. Stir in the herbs and seasonings
  and the giblets.
  
  Pour on the boiling liquid, and simmer until the liquid is absorbed, about
  30 minutes, and the rice is just barely done.
  
  Amounts may be adjusted to the size of the bird.  This recipe should stuff
  a 15-lb turkey.

  This recipe is called garlic soup because it has so
  much garlic in it but it is actually a very hearty
  soup with a very sweet garlic flavor. It is well worth
  the time it takes to peel the garlic but you must use
  fresh garlic do not replace with dried minced. Place 2
  cups of the water in a large stock pot. Add the whole
  garlic cloves and cook over medium heat for 15 min.
  Remove the garlic cloves and mash them thoroughly
  before processing. Blend in a food processor. Add the
  remaining 2 1/2 qts water the barley and the wild
  rice.  Bring to a boil cover and simmer for 15 min.
  Add the remaining ingredients bring to a boil turn
  down to simmer and cook until tender about 30-45 min.
  This soup tastes best if made a day or two in advance
  to give the flavors a chance to blend. Nutrition (per

      Title: WILD RICE CASSEROLE
 Categories: Main dish, Side dish, Digest
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 c  Wild rice, uncooked
      1 lb Fresh mushrooms, sliced
           -thickly
      1 c  Minced onion
      3 c  Vegetable broth
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
 
  Rinse wild rice well.  Combine wild rice, mushrooms, onion, and garlic in a
  3 quart casserole dish. Pour broth over it all, cover, and bake at 350
  degrees for about 1 1/2 hours.
  
  I use the "jumbo domestic Canadian" wild rice for the best results, but any
  wild rice will taste good.  I usually stir after an hour of baking.  The
  liquid is absorbed all at once toward the end, don't panic!  I add a
  teaspoon of salt when entertaining SAD eaters, and often increase the
  amount of onion and garlic when my husband and I are eating alone.
  
  I am a wild rice fanatic and mail order mine from a place in Minnesota.  I
  can e-mail the address to anyone who is interested.

 Categories: Digest
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6 lg Vidalia Onions or 8 med
           -yellow onions.
      1 c  Mushrooms, chopped
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
      1    Apple, peeled, cored,
           -chopped (about 1 cup)
      2 T  Fresh parsley, minced
      2 T  Fresh marjoram, minced (used
      1 t  Dried)
      1 t  Lemon juice
    1/4 t  Paprika
           -Salt & pepper to taste
      1 c  Wild rice, cooked
      1 x  Vegetable stock
 
  1. Preheat oven to 400F
  
  2. Cut 1/4 unch off both ends of the onion and peel off dry layers. Bake
  onions, root end down in baking dish for 30 minutes, or until golden brown.
  Let cool and hollow out each onion from top, leaving 1/2 inch shell (outer
  most 2-4 layers).
  
  3. Chop 1 cup of reserved onion and saute with mushrooms in a medium hot
  pan for 3 minutes.  Add garlic and apple and saute 3 minutes. Add parsley,
  marjoram, lemon juice, paprika, salt and pepper; combine the sauteed
  mixture with the cooked rice.
  
  4. Fill each onion shell with rice mixture. Pour enough stock to cover
  bottom of onions (about 1/2 inch). Bake for 20 minutes, basting the stuffed
  onions with stock occasionally.
  
  Makes 6-8 servings depending on which onions you use.
  
  My suggestion on this is that the onions took A LOT longer to cook than 30
  minutes.  If you want to fix this for a dinner, I recommend that you bake
  the onions the night before, and then finish up the next evening with the
  filling.  The onions will also be cool then, instead of working with hot
  onions that just came out of the oven.

 Categories: Digest, Sept.
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Wild rice
      1 c  Long grain brown rice
      1 c  Green (French) lentils

--------------------------------COMBINE WITH--------------------------------
      1 ea Red, yellow, green bell
           Pepper, chopped
      2 c  Small cherry tomatoes
      1    Or 2 carrots
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh basil (more or
           Less)
      1    To 2 tablespoon or chopped
           Fresh mint

----------------------------------DRESSING----------------------------------
        x  Nonfat tomato-herb
        x  Red wine vinegar
 
  Cook grains separately, in 2 cups water, until done, 45 minutes or less.
  
  For the dressing, I used a prepared nonfat tomato-herb dressing (Trader
  Joe's) mixed about half and half with red wine vinegar because I generally
  find prepared nonfat dressings too thick and too sweet for my taste. I
  didn't measure, but I used perhaps half a cup, maybe as much as a cup,
  total, just enough to moisten everything.
  
  I let it sit in the refrigerator all day, to let the flavors mix. I don't
  know how many people it served--it filled a large bowl-- but there wasn't
  any left over after the potluck (and while I was glad that everyone liked
  it, I was sorry not to have some to take home).

 Categories: Digest, Jan.
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 c  Brown basmati rice
    1/2 c  Wild rice
    1/2 lb Frozen black-eyed peas
     10 oz Bag frozen mustard greens
     10 oz Bag frozen collard greens
  5 1/2 c  Water
      1 t  Basil
      1 t  Garlic powder
      1 t  To 1*T Old Bay seasoning
      2 cn Stewed tomatoes with liquid
 
  This is a variation of something my grandmother used to make with h*m
  hocks. It's a long way from the original. This makes approx. 5 qts., enough
  to freeze half or feed a crowd.
  
  Put the water in the cooker, turn burner to high. Stir in spices.  Rinse
  rices and put in cooker.  Throw in black-eyed peas, greens, and stewed
  tomatoes. Bring to simmer with the top off, stirring occasionally, until
  frozen stuff has thawed somewhat and greens are separated.  Lock the lid
  down, bring to high pressure. Cook at high pressure for 30 minutes, remove
  from heat and allow natural pressure release. Adjust seasoning if
  necessary. Tobasco sauce is a must on the table.
  
  I use an 8-qt.cooker, cut recipe in half if you use a smaller cooker.

      Yield: 12 servings
 
      1 ea Meaty turkey carcass, left
           Over from 20 pound bird
      4 qt Water or broth
      1 tb Chopped garlic
      3 c  Chopped celery

  Take the meat off the turkey carcass as soon as dinner is over and
  toss the carcass into a large pot.  Add all of the spices and water
  (or broth). I usually also add a cup or two of white wine.  Bring to
  a boil and then reduce heat to simmer for an additional 6-8 hours.
  Cool the soup and strain. If you wish, skim any fat from the broth at
  this point. Return the broth to the pot, add large pieces of cooked
  turkey and any coarsely chopped fresh vegetables you wish to the
  mixture; add wild rice, barley, or whatever legume you wish, and
  simmer (covered) until the rice is done and the vegetables are
  crisp-tender. Enjoy......this also freezes well.

           -watercress or parsley)
 
  This looks like a nice dish++chicken breast stuffed with wild rice,
  some veggies and crepe strips to fill in for noodles.
  
  Establishment: Hotel Riverside Plaza Tai Chang Kiu Road, Shatin, New
  Territories. Western Cuisine Practical Class Gold Award - Hot entree
  Chef: Chan Chi-hung Philip (Hotel Riverside Plaza)
  
  To prepare: 1. Precook wild rice as a pilaf with chopped onions,
  chicken stock, and appropriate amount of water. When cool, add grated
  Parmesan cheese and let mixture cool.
  
  2.  Cut chicken breast portions butterfly style (i.e. slice in half
  and spread open.  Flatten and slightly stretch them (by gently
  pounding them between two sheets of wax paper or inside a clean
  plastic bag. Season with salt and pepper.
  
  3.  Lay a cone-shaped portion of rice stuffing on one side of each
  flattened breast.  Roll chicken breast up in a cone shape.  Wrap each
  cone firmly in aluminum foil (to maintain shape during cooking:  the
  professional recipe calls for plastic foil wrapping, but aluminum
  foil is recommended for home cooking).
  
  4.  Blanch green leek stems, then refresh in cold water.
  
  5.  Make 4 very thin crepes about 20 cms wide (ingredients not
  included above).
  
  To cook: 1. Blanch pearled vegetables, celery and peas, then saute in
  approximately 10 g butter, adding salt and pepper according to taste.
  Keep a quarter aside.
  
  2.  To make sauce, reduce chicken stock and add fresh cream.  Cook
  briefly, then strain.  Add fresh lemon juice and finish with butter
  as required. Adjust seasoning and add chopped chervil according to
  taste.
  
  3.  Saute morels in approximately 10 g butter.
  
  4.  Heat some chicken stock (5 cups should be sufficient to completely
  cover the four wrapped chicken portions).  Simmer breasts in hot
  stock for approximately 7 minutes.  Remove from pan, discard aluminum
  foil wrappings, and saute in approximately 60 g butter until lightly
  browned. Then slice each into six portions, cut at an angle (30 to 40
  degrees).
  
  To present: Treasure Hunt takes the form of a chicken breast "boat",
  with morel oars being rowed towards crepe "treasure bag" of vegetable
  "precious stones" some of which have spilled on the shore.
  
  1.  Portion out 3/4 of vegetable pearls, celery and peas onto crepes
  lifting crepe edges upwards to form bag shapes.  Tie tops of bags with
  blanched green leek stems (with decorative knotted bows if stems are
  long enough).
  
  2.  Pour sauce onto plates.  Arrange chicken slices in a line on
  sauce, lay thick ends of morels between them.  Place a crepe bag on
  each plate, with reserved vegetable pearls laid beside bag.  Garnish
  with chervil sprigs (or watercress or parsley).

      Title: WILD WILD DINNER (WILD RICE/WILD MUSHROOMS)
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Wild rice (I like Lungren's
           Mix)
      2 c  Fresh wild mushrooms,
           Chopped
      1 md Onion, diced
      2 c  Mushroom/vege broth
        x  Balsamic vinegar
 
  ~ put rice, liquid into a covered casserole dish and place in oven at
  around 300 F.
  
  ~ preheat a pan, add balsamic and immediately added diced onions.
  
  ~ after around 10 minutes add mushrooms to onions, turn flame to lowest
  setting
  
  ~ when the liquid in the oven boils turn oven down to 250.  When it's
  around 3/4 absorbed (around 45 minutes), stir in mushroom and onions.
  
  ~ when liquid is fully absorbed turn off oven, fluff rice, and put in oven
  partially uncovered for another 15 minutes.
  
  Serve with green vegetables like broccoli. This tastes especially good with
  some chopped walnuts added!
  
  (Mushroom broth is the liquid that comes out of meaty mushrooms when you
  dry-sautee them.  I.e. put it in a pan and heat with no added liquid. As
  the liquid comes out of the mushroom, pour it off and save.)
  
  I used horse mushrooms (relative of the button) and some rehydrated
  Boletes.  Of course you could do this with brown rice, domesticated
  mushrooms as well..

    1/8 t  Freshly grated pepper
      2 c  Cooked wild rice
 
  1.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F).
  
  2.  Cut each squash in half and remove the seeds and pulp.  In a large
  baking dish, place the squash, cut side down, with about 1 inch of
  water.  Bake until tender, about 45 minutes.
  
  3.  Pour about 2 inches of water into a large stockpot.  Place a
  collapsible steamer in the pot, cover, and bring to a boil.  Place the
  Brussels sprouts in the steamer, cover, and steam for 5 to 7 minutes, or
  until tender.  Set aside.
  
  4.  Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat the oil over low heat.  Add the
  onion and saute for 10 minutes, stirring frequently.  Stir in the
  fennel, marjoram, sage, orange juice, lemon juice, and pepper, and
  simmer for 3 minutes.  Stir in the cooked wild rice and the Brussels
  sprouts and heat through.
  
  5.  Spoon the wild rice and Brussels sprout mixture into the squash
  cavities.  Serve immediately.
  
  I often microwave the acorn squash by placing in a shallow glass pan
  with about 1/2-inch of water, covering with saran wrap and nuking for
  about 10 minutes or until tender.
