--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/2  pound         skinless dried fava beans
                        --2 cups
   2      tablespoons   olive oil

   2                    vine-ripened tomatoes -- chopped
     1/2  cup           thinly sliced radishes

1. Put fava beans in a large bowl of cold water. Let stand in a cool place for at least 4 hours or overnight. If the weather is warm, place the bowl in the refrigerator.

2. Drain and rinse the beans. Place them in a large pot and add fresh water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a slow simmer and cook, uncovered, over low heat until the beans are very soft and all of the liquid has been absorbed, about 1 hour. Stir often toward the end of the cooking time, and add a little more water if the beans become too dry. Mash the beans with a potato masher until smooth. Stir in oil and season with salt.

3. In a large pot, combine spinach, dandelion greens or broccoli rabe and 2 tablespoons of water. Cover and cook over medium-high heat until wilted and tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a colander and press out any excess cooking liquid.

4. Spoon the warm fava bean puree into the center of a warmed platter. Place cooked greens, olives, onions, arugula or watercress, pepperoncini, tomatoes and radishes in 7 separate piles around the puree and serve.

Makes 4 servings.

   2      tablespoons   fresh lemon juice
                        --plus more to taste
   1      tablespoon    extra-virgin olive oil
                        salt & freshly ground black pepper -- to taste

1. In a large pot, combine wine, parsley and tarragon sprigs and garlic. Bring to a boil over high heat.

2. Add mussels, cover and steam for 2 minutes, shaking the pot occasionally. Begin checking mussels; as they open, transfer them to a large bowl. Total steaming time will be about 5 minutes. Discard any unopened mussels. Reserve broth in pot. When cool enough to handle, pick mussels from their shells. Refrigerate, discarding shells.

3. Add potatoes to mussel broth; bring to a simmer. Cook, partly covered, until just tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove potatoes with a slotted spoon, place in a colander and rinse under cold water. Strain broth through a fine sieve lined with cheesecloth; measure out 2 tablespoons. (Freeze any remaining broth for another use.)

4. In a mixing bowl, whisk 2 tablespoons broth, shallot, mustard, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, oil, 2 tablespoons chopped parsley and chopped tarragon. Season with salt and pepper. Add mussels and potatoes; toss to coat. Adjust seasoning with salt, pepper and more lemon juice, if desired. (The salad will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 6 hours.) Just before serving, garnish with remaining 2 tablespoons chopped parsley.

Makes about 6 cups, for 4 servings.
