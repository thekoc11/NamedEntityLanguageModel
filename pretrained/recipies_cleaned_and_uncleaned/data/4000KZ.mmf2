    3/4 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Salt

  two 9-inch cake pans; set aside.
  
  2. In a large mixing bowl, beat egg whites until frothy, about 2
  minutes. Gradually add 1/2 cup sugar and continue beating until

  3. In another large mixing bowl, sift together cake flour, remaining
  1 cup sugar and the baking soda and salt. Add oil and 1/2 cup
  buttermilk; beat for 1 minute, costantly scraping down the sides and
  bottom of the bowl. Add remaining 1/2 cup buttermilk, the egg yolks

  6. Remove pans to wire cooling racks and let cake cool in pans for 10
  minutes. Remove cake from pans and cool completely on racks.
  
  7. To make the frosting: In a medium mixing bowl, beat egg whites
  until stiff enough to hold a point when the beaters are lifted, about
        4    minutes.
  
  8. Combine sugar, water and corn syrup in a medium-sized,
  heavy-bottomed saucepan. Cover and bring to a rolling boil over high
  heat. Uncover, and cook until the mixture measures 242 degrees on a
  candy thermometer.
  
  9. In a thin stream, slowly pour hot sugar syrup into the beaten egg
  whites. Continue beating until stiff peaks form when the beaters are
  lifted. Stir in vanilla.
  
  10. Frost cake and serve.

MMMMM--------------------LOW FAT COCONUT MILK-------------------------
     18 oz Non Fat Plain Yogurt
      8 oz Non Fat Milk
      2    Packets Equal Sweetener
      2 ts Imitation Coconut Extract

MMMMM---------------------------CURRY--------------------------------
      3 c  Low Fat Coconut Milk
      1 tb Thai Red Curry Base
      1 lb Cubed Chicken
      2 tb Fish Sauce
      2 ts Lemon Juice
      1    Tomato, Diced
      3    Scallions, Diced
      2 c  Mushrooms, Sliced
      1    Yellow Pepper, Diced
      2 ts Thai Garlic Chili Sauce
           Fresh Sweet Basil
 
  This recipe is the same as my recipe for Chicken Curry except that
  since the coconut milk is so high in fat I decided to try to come up
  with a substitute.  This is the resulting formulation. It turns out
  to be a very good substitute and the only thing I found needed to be
  changed is that this recipe required quite a bit of stirring at the
  beginning to keep the yogurt from coming out of suspension when the
  cold or room temperature chicken is added.  Combine the yogurt and
  milk in a blender bowl and process until well mixed. Add the Equal
  sweetener and pulse blender to mix. Add the artificial coconut
  extract to the mixture and adjust to taste if necessary.  In a large
  saucepan, combine coconut milk with curry base over medium heat until
  oil appears on top. Add chicken, seasoning sauce, lemon juice and
  simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add remaining
  ingredients except mushrooms and garlic chili sauce. Cover and simmer
  for 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and garlic chili sauce to taste. Cover
  and simmer 2 minutes. Serve hot over rice. Garnish with sprigs of
  fresh sweet basil. From: Syd's Cookbook.

  NOTES:
  
  These cookies are great.  They are very sweet though. I've only used
  an egg white when I've made these. Also, the dough is kind of
  crumbly. I ended up kind of forming them with a spoon and my hands
  into little balls. My experience was that they only took about 8
  minutes to bake. I let them cool on the sheets for about 5 minutes
  before easily moving them to cooling racks.  The dough makes them
  look like they're not going to turn out, but I was pleasantly
  surprised the first time I made them. You won't be able to tell that
  they're low calorie and low fat. ENJOY! Let me know if you like them.

      4    Eggs
    1/2 ts Cream of tartar
    1/4 c  Low fat cottage cheese
      2 tb Soy flour
      1    Package artificial sweetener
 
  1.  Preaheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat muffin cups with a little
  vegetable oil. (or use butter, margarine, or pan spray) 2. Separate
  the eggs very carefully, allowing no egg yolk to mix with the whites.
  3. Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until frothy. Add the
  cream of tartar and continue beating just until stiff peaks form. 4.
  Combine egg yolks, cottage cheese, soy flour, and sweetener.  Fold
  this mixture carefully into the egg whites. 5. Fill each muffin cup
  2/3 full of batter. Bake the muffins for about 30 minutes, until the
  are golden brown and spring back when touched. Variation:  To make
  spice muffins, stir 1/2 ts cinnamon, 1/4 ts ground ginger, and 1/8 ts
  cloves into the soy flour before adding to the egg yolks.
  
  Note These turned out tasty but sort of fell like crumpets, I would
  be more careful about not overmixing next time. MM

 Categories: Breads, Breakfast, Low carb

      1 c  Protein drink mix
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Baking soda
      2 ts Cream of tartar
      1 lg Egg, separated
    1/2 c  Heavy Cream
    1/4 c  Water
      2 tb Unsalted butter, melted
 
  Heat waffle iron. Whisk dry ingredients together in a medium bowl.
  Whisk yolk with cream, water and butter. Beat egg white until it just
  holds a 2-inch peak. Add liquid ingredients to dry ingredients in a
  thin steady stream while gently mixing with a rubber spatula; be
  careful not to add liquid faster than you can incorporate it. Toward
  end of mixing, use a folding motion to incorporate ingredients;
  gently fold egg white into batter. Spread appropriate amount of
  batter onto waffle iron. Following manufacturer's instructions, cook
  waffle until golden brown, 2 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately. (You
  can keep waffles warm on a wire rack in a 200-degree oven for up to 5
  minutes.) Makes 3 to 4 waffles. NOTES : "If you're out of buttermilk,
  try this sweet-milk variation. By making your own baking powder using
  baking soda and cream of tartar and by cutting back on the quantity
  of milk, you can make a thick, quite respectable batter. The result
  is a waffle with a crisp crust and a moist interior." -- Christopher

  Melissa Mierau's notes:  It really foamed when the dry ingredients
  were added to the wet, sort of like peanut brittle. Then with further
  stirring it thickened up. They baked into a real nice cookie but only
  made about 2 dozen (using teaspoon for scoop instead of ice cream
  scoop). I will double recipe next time! From: Melissa Mierau Date:

      Title: LOW-FAT BANOFFI PIE
 Categories: Desserts, Low fat
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8 oz Cereal - I tried to use
           Golden grahams, but could
           Only buy
           One-serving pack, which
           Wasn't quite enough, so
           Added some All-Bran.
           Another time I might try
           Shreddies instead.  American
           Readers feel free
           To use no-fat graham
           Crackers (which I can't get)
           Instead
      1 tb Pear and Apple spread (I
           Used Pear and Apricot, which
           Is
           What I had - I expect apple
           Butter would be a good
           Substitute)
      1    Tin skimmed condensed milk -
           If unavailable, then as
           Low-fat as you can
           Get
      3    Bananas, sliced lengthwise
           About 8 oz cream substitute
           I used fromage frais mixed
           With Quark, but
           If that means nothing to you
           Then use yogurt or other
           Cream substitute.
 
  The day before, boil unopened can of milk for three hours - don't let
  it boil dry whatever you do.  Allow to cool. Make biscuit base by
  turning the cereal into crumbs, melting the fruit butter in the
  microwave (only about 30 seconds), mixing the two together and
  pressing down into the flan dish. Leave in the fridge to harden.
  Please note that cereal crumbs quicker than digestives/graham
  crackers do, so be prepared, or what you'll have is powder!
  
  Next day, open the can of milk, which will have turned to toffee, and
  spread it over the biscuit base - which will try and stick to the
  toffee, so just swoosh it round as best you can. Top this with the
  sliced bananas, and instantly with the cream substitute (if you hang
  about, the bananas will go brown and ucky). Refrigerate until wanted.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     24    Plain chocolate wafer
           Cookies (half of a 9 ounce
           Box)
           Nonfat cooking spray
      2    (8 ounce) packages fat-free
           Cream cheese
      1 c  Sugar
      1 c  Cocoa
      1 ts Pure vanilla extract
      3 tb Sugar-free seedless black
           Raspberry preserves
    1/2 c  Fat free egg substitutes
      1    (16 ounce) container
           Fat-free sour cream
    1/4 ts Salt
 
  For Fruit Topping:
  
  1 (10 ounce) box sweetened frozen raspberries, thawed
        2    Tablespoons cornstarch
  
  In a food processor or blender, grind the plain chocolate wafers into
  fine crumbs. Generously coat a 8.1/2 inch or 9 inch springform pan
  with nonstick cooking spray. Pour the crumbs into the pan and tilt to
  coat the bottom and the sides evenly. Set aside.
  
  Preheat oven to 350^F. With an electric mixer, beat the fat-free cream
  cheese until soft. Add the sugar, cocoa, vanilla extract and raspberry
  preserves and continue beating until the ingredients are
  incorporated. Add the egg substitutes, fat free sour cream and salt
  and continue beating until no lumps remain and mixture is smooth and
  liquid. You may have to beat the mixture for several minutes to reach
  this consistency.
  
  Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Place in oven and immediately
  reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees. Bake for one hour, or until
  center is set and firm to the touch. Turn off oven and allow
  cheesecake to stay in cooling oven for one hour longer. Remove and
  cool completely. Refrigerate overnight before serving.
  
  To make the raspberry sauce, puree the raspberries in a food
  processor or blender. Strain the pulp through a tea strainer,
  pressing to remove all the seeds. Discard seeds. Place the cornstarch
  in a saucepan and stir in the raspberry juice. Bring to a boil,
  stirring constantly until thickened. Remove from heat immediately to
  prevent lumps from forming. Cool and chill. Serve one tablespoon of
  sauce on top of each slice of cheesecake.
  
  Cake can also be frozen for two to three weeks before serving. To
  serve, thaw for 2 days in the refrigerator, then allow to come to
  room temperature before slicing.

    1/2 c  Prune puree (see note below)

      3 lg Egg whites
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla

  In a mixer bowl, combine water, prune puree, egg whites and vanilla.
  Beat thoroughly to blend. Combine flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder,
  baking soda and salt. Beat dry ingredients into liquid mixture.
  Spread batter into prepared pan.  Bake about 30 minutes, or until

  sugar or with the following icing.
  
  NOTE:  To prepare prune puree, simmer 1/2 c prunes in water to cover

  prunes through a sieve, leaving behind the skin particles and seeds.
  
  ICING:  Combine 2 1/2 c powdered sugar, 1/4 c cocoa and 1/4 c low fat

  This recipe for all of you healthy chocolate freaks. Note at the
  bottom, there is a method for making prune puree (very similar to the
  WonderSlim product that no one can find). This recipe comes from an
  article about fruit, since it uses prune puree instead of fat. My one
  gripe, about which I have written to the paper, is that they do NOT
  do a nutritional analysis of a recipe, even though they call it

 Categories: Muffins, Quickbreads, Brunch
      Yield: 16 Muffins
 
      1 c  Sugar
      1 lg Egg
      2    Ripe bananas; mashed
    1/3 c  Applesauce, sweet or unsweet
      8 oz Vanilla-flavor lowfat yogurt
     10 oz Semisweet chocolate chips
      2 c  All purpose flour
      1 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  Preheat oven to 375~. In a large bowl, combine the sugar and the egg
  and blend well. Add the mashed bananas, applesauce, and yogurt and
  stir to combine. Stir in the chocolate chips. In a separate bowl,
  combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Make a well
  in the center of the flour mixture and pour the wet ingredients into
  the well. Stir until just blended. The batter will be lumpy. Pour the
  batter evenly into the two 8-cup muffin pans that have been well
  greased or lined with paper muffin cups. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or
  until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.
  This is a light-colored muffin so be careful not to overbake. Let the
  muffins cool in the pan for 2-3 minutes, then carefully remove and
  place on a wire rack to cool.
  
  NOTE: You can substitute two 4-oz jars of banana baby food (such as
  Gerber) for the applesauce and use just 1 ripe banana. Or try other
  baby food fruits such as pineapple, apple or plum.

      2 tb Buttermilk
      1 ts Lemon juice
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Randall Chrisman This is something that a
  friend of mine learned in her efforts to cut down on the amount of
  fat in her diet. Seems she and her husband were quite fond of sour
  cream (being the kind of people that would toss it onto the potato
  and not stop until you couldn't see the potato!) This is a really
  great substitute for the topping...such to the point that I'm not
  fond of sour cream anymore. Optional:
  
  Schilling Cheese Sauce Mix Hidden Valley Reduced Calorie Ranch
  
  Mix the Hidden Valley Blue Cheese Dressing MIX. Dump the cottage
  cheese, buttermilk and lemon juice into a food processor with metal
  blade. Process until smooth (and I mean SMOOTH...can turn grainy
  unless you give it time...when you think it's done, process it some
  more.) When it's done, you have the option of blending in any of the
  powdered dressing mixes (we use 3/4 package for flavor - more than
  that and you've reduced your fat intake and TRIPLED your sodium
  intake.) You need to pour the contents back into the cottage cheese
  container and let it set for an hour or so.

 Categories: Desserts, Jams
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 c  Sliced strawberries
    1/3 c  Sugar
      2 tb Lemon juice
      1    Envelope unflavored gelatin
    1/2 c  Water
 
  1.   In a medium saucepan, combine strawberries, sugar and lemon
  juice. Heat 5 minutes, crushing the berries slightly. Bring to a
  boil; boll rapidly, stirring constantly, 3 minutes.
  
  2.   In a small bowl, sprinkle unflavored gelatin over cold water. Let
  stand 1 minute.  Add to strawberry mixture and heat, stirring until
  gelatin is completely dissolved, about 3 minutes.
  
  3.   Let jam stand 5 minutes, skiing off foam with a spoon. Ladle into
  jars.  Cover and cool slightly before storing in the refrigerator for
  several weeks or in the freezer for longer storage.
  
  If cooked jam does not set 24 hours after processing there are steps
  that can be taken to solve the problem. The Department of Agriculture
  Home and Garden Bulletin No.  56 states:
  
  Soft jams made with regular pectin can sometimes be improved by
  recooking according to the following directions. It is best to recook
  only 4 to 6 cup of jelly or jam at one time.
  
  To remake with powdered pectin: Measure the jam to be recooked. For
  each quart of jelly or jam, measure 1/@ cup sugar, 1/4 cup water and
  4 tsp powdered pectin. Mix the pectin and water and bring to boiling,
  stirring constantly to prevent.scorching.  Add the jam and sugar.
  Stir thoroughly. Bring to a full rolling boil over high heat,
  stirring constantly. Boil mixture hard for 1/2 minute. Remove jam
  from the heat; skim off foam. Ladle into hot sterilized jars.  Adjust
  lids and screw bands and process in a boiling water bath for 5
  minutes. Start counting time when water comes to a boil.
  
  To remake with liquid pectin: Measure the jam to be recooked. For each
  quart of jam, measure 3/4 cup sugar, 2 Tbsp lemon juice and 2 Tbsp
  liquid pectin. Bring jam to boiling over high heat. Quickly add the
  sugar, lemon juice and pectin and bring to a full rolling boil; stir
  constantly. Boil mixture hard for 1 minute. Remove jam from the heat;
  skim off foam. Ladle into hot sterilized jars.  Adjust lids and screw
  bands and process in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes. Start
  counting time when water comes to a boil.  If there are problems with

 Categories: Canning, Preserves, Pickles
      Yield: 1 Text
 
 
  The following treatment results in a better product texture but must
  be carefully managed to avoid possible spoilage. Place jars in a
  canner filled half way with warm (120 degree to 140 degree F) water.
  Then, add hot water to a level 1 inch above jars. Heat the water
  enough to maintain 180 degree to 185 degree F water temperature for
  30 minutes. Check with a candy or jelly thermometer to be certain
  that the water temperature is at least 180 degrees F during the
  entire 30 minutes. Temperatures higher than 185 degrees F may cause
  unnecessary softening of pickles. Caution: Use only when recipe
  indicates.

  gravy. Cook the fettuccine in boiling water according to the package
  directions until it is al dente and drain. Add the hot pasta and the
  garlic and the vegetables to the sauce in the skillet. Stir and cook

  NOTES : MC formatting and posted by bobbi744@sojourn.com * To Bake
  Garlic: Preheat the oven to 350=B0 Place a whole head of garlic in a
  small baking pan. Drizzle one teaspoon of olive oil over the head of
  garlic, add 1/4 cup water to the pan. Bake the garlic, loosely
  covered with aluminum foil, for 45-60 minutes or until the cloves are
  soft. The cloves will slip right out of their skins to be mashed,
  chopped or served whole. The whole garlic cloves can be served as a
  side dish with any roast meat, the mashed garlic cloves are also
  delicious mixed with hot homemade mashed potatoes.

      Title: LOWFAT LAMB RECIPE
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -==================
 
  Ingredients:
  
  lamb gigot chops (slices across the leg, with the bone removed)
  breadcrumbs (1 slice of bread ground in a food processor) 1 clove
  chopped garlic 1 handful of parsley Dijon mustard a little vegetable
  stock Use lamb gigot chops (these are slices across the leg, with the
  bone removed.) Cut off all visible fat.
  
  Start by making a mix of breadcrumbs and chopped garlic and parsley,
  to taste (I put a slice of notquitefresh bread in a food processor
  with a clove of garlic and a handful of fresh parsley).
  
  Heat a heavy pan without adding any fat  a nonstick frying pan for
  example. I used a shallow Le Creuset casserole for the whole thing.
  
  When its really hot, drop in the lamb chops.  They should seal at
  once. Count to about 20, then turn. Count to 20 again. The chops
  should be a definate brown. Lift out of pan and place in roasting
  tin. Spread a thick layer of Dijon mustard onto chops.  Put a thick
  layer of crumb mixture on top  its OK if some falls off into the
  dish. Cook at 220 C (sorry don't kow other measures) for 20 minutes.
  Remove from oven. Lift out chops to warmed serving dish.  Place
  roasting tin on top of stove and deglaze with a little vegetable
  stock.  Thicken with cornflour/arrowroot if you like.
  
  Pour gravy over and serve.
  
  I served this with baked potatoes (this is the correct UK spelling)
  and steamed veggies (broccoli, mangetout and baby sweetcorn). It was
  lovely.
  
  A variant might be to deglaze the pan with a little red wine, and
  thicken with redcurrant jelly.
  
  This was really yummy, and my nondieting hubby loved it too. I had
  two very small chops (probably totalled 4oz) He had two very large
  chops. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.40

  minutes. Divide the dough into 20 balls, cover & set aside for 20
  minutes.
  
  Roll out each ball on an unfloured board into small, flat, thin
  circles. If the dough is stiff, try lightly greasing the rolling pin.
  Roll each luchi as thinly as possible. If you make puri, roll them
  out thinner than you would when making puri.
  
  Heat 2 or 3 inches of oil in a skillet or wok until it is very hot.
  Drop the luchi into the hot oil & press down lightly with the back of
  a spoon. They will puff up exactly like puri. Drain & serve
  immediately.

MMMMM-----------------------FOR THE BATTER----------------------------
      7 oz Plain Flour

    1/2 pt Water
           Pinch of salt
      1    Egg white

MMMMM-------------------------TO GARNISH------------------------------
           Lemon wedges
           Small bunch of parsley
 
  Clean the squids inside and out, discarding the 'bone' and keeping
  only the bag-like bodies. Pat dry and cut in rings of about 1/2".
  Season with sal, pepper, and lemon juice. Make a batter with the
  water, flour, the yolk and the salt. Set aside for 30 minutes.  Beat
  the egg white till firm and fold into the batter. Sprinkle the squid
  rings with plain flour, and dip in the batter so as to cover them
  completely. Deep-fry in very hot oil (max.3 minutes, unless you
  happen to enjoy rubber bands). Serve with the lemon edges and parsley
  twigs. ----- As you see there is no mention of cheese, romano or
  otherwise, but I can vouch that the resulting rings are quite crispy,
  dry and oil-free, provided that the oil is .very. hot (fry only a few
  rings at a time). I guess you can always add the cheese... ---

      2 ts Chopped fresh lavender

    1/4 c  Fresh-ground black pepper
      3    Rib steaks on the bone,

    1/4 lb Butter, at room temperature
      8    Nicoise olives, halved and
           -pitted
      2    Anchovy fillets, or 1/2
           -teaspoon anchovy paste
  2 3/4 ts Salt
      1    Lemon, cut in half
     20    Baby artichokes (about 2-1/2
           -pounds)
      4    Cloves garlic, chopped
      4    Bay leaves
      2 lb Yukon Gold or baking
           -potatoes, peeled and cut
           -into 1/4-inch slices
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
    1/2 c  Water, more if needed
 
  * Restaurant LuLu * San Francisco *
  
  1. In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup of the oil, the parsley, savory,
  the chopped fresh thyme or 4 teaspoons dried, the rosemary, the
  lavender flowers, if using, and the pepper. Trim off the fat from the
  edge of the steaks. Put the steaks in a glass dish or stainless-steel
  pan and rub them on both sides with the marinade. Cover and marinate
  in the refrigerator overnight.
  
  2. In a food processor, puree the butter with the olives, anchovies
  and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Cover and chill. Remove from the
  refrigerator 1 hour before serving.
  
  3. Squeeze the juice from the lemon and add it, along with the lemon
  halves, to a large bowl filled with cold water. Working with one
  artichoke at a time, remove and discard the tough outer leaves,
  leaving the pale-green inner ones attached. Using a small knife, trim
  around the bottom of the artichoke below the leaves to get rid of the
  remaining bits of the removed leaves. Peel the stem, leaving it about
  1 inch long. Cut off the top third of the leaves. Cut the artichokes
  lengthwise into 1/4-inch slices and put them in the lemon water to
  prevent darkening. Repeat with the remaining artichokes.
  
  4. In a large frying pan, heat 1/3 cup of the oil over moderate heat.
  Add the garlic, the thyme sprigs or the remaining 1 teaspoon dried
  thyme, and the bay leaves and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the
  potatoes, 2 teaspoons of the salt, the wine and water. Cover, reduce
  the heat to moderately low and simmer until the potatoes are just
  tender, about 10 minutes. Drain the artichokes thoroughly and add
  them, with the remaining 1/3 cup oil, to the potatoes. Cover, bring
  back to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the
  artichokes are tender, about 10 minutes longer. If all the liquid
  evaporates, add up to 1/4 cup water during cooking. Set aside,
  covered.
  
  5. Light the grill or heat the broiler. Sprinkle the steaks with the
  remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Grill or broil the steaks for 6 minutes.
  Turn them and cook to your taste, about 6 minutes longer for medium
  rare. Transfer the steaks to a carving board and leave to rest in a
  warm spot for about 5 minutes. Reheat the potatoes and artichokes
  while the steaks rest. Cut the steaks into thin slices.
  
  6. To serve, put a mound of the potatoes and artichokes in the center
  of each plate. Arrange the steak slices, overlapping, on the
  vegetables and top with a spoonful of the room-temperature olive
  butter.
  
  Substituting Large Artichokes: If you're using large artichokes, cut
  off the stems. Remove and discard all but the pale-green inner leaves
  and cut off the top third of the leaves. Cut the artichokes into
  quarters and remove the fuzzy chokes. Cut each quarter in half from
  top to bottom.
  
  A spicy young Rhone red such as Chave's Hermitage or a
  Chateauneuf-du-Pape from Beaucastel marries well with the herby
  charred beef and the olive butter.

MMMMM------------------------LUMPIA SAUCE-----------------------------
      2 c  Pineapple juice
      1 c  Ketchup
    1/2 ts Vinegar
      1 tb Brown sugar
      1 ds Hot pepper sauce
    1/2    Inch cube crushed ginger
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 tb Cornstarch
 
  Doilies:  Combine flour, water and salt to taste and mix thoroughly
  with a wire whisk to remove lumps. Batter should be about the
  consistency of a crepe batter. Add a little water if it is too thick.
  If the batter thickens as it sits, you may have to add more water.
  Heat a 6" crepe pan and wipe out with lightly oiled wax paper. Pour
  on batter quickly to cover the bottom.  Pour off excess. Allow to
  cook over low heat until the edges begin to curl and pull away from
  the sides of the pan. Remove and place on clean, dry surface. Repeat,
  oiling pan each time. Do not stack doilies on top of each other until
  each has cooled. Before filling, put off excess batter to make a
  perfect circle.
  
  Filling:  Cook pork or beef in a large skillet until pinkness is gone.
  Drain off grease.  Add shrimp, onions, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots,
  celery, garlic and carrot; cook until carrot is almost tender. Stir in
  remaining ingredients except the egg white and oil. Mix well. Cook
  until bean sprouts are limp.
  
  Pour mixture into strainer and cool, allowing as much liquid as
  possible to drain off before filling rolls. Use about 1 heaping tsp.
  for each doily. Place filling near one side. Roll doily over filling
  a couple of times; fold in sides and roll up tightly.  Seal flap with
  a little egg white.
  
  Deep fry in corn oil heated to about 375 F., until rolls are golden.
  Drain thoroughly on paper towels and serve with sauce.
  
  Note: If rolls are filled ahead of time, cover and refrigerate until
  it is time to serve.  Return to room temperature and fry.
  
  Lumpia Sauce:  Combine all ingredients but the corn starch and heat.
  Meanwhile, mix corn starch with enough of the pineapple juice mixture
  to make a smooth paste. Return cornstarch mixture to pot and simmer
  until mixture is thick.  Makes about 3 cups.

  Boil the pork in a pot until tender and the fat comes out. Remove the
  pork from the pot and drain.  Put the lard in a large skillet and
  saute the pork, garlic, onion and bean curd. Add the shrimp, string
  beans, cabbage, sweet potatoes and a little water. Season with the
  salt and cook over medium heat until tender. Set aside on a platter
  to cool, add the celery on top.
  
  LUMPIA WRAPPERS
  
  Sift the flour into a bowl. In another bowl, mix the salt with the
  water. Add 1 cup of salted water to the flour to make a stiff dough.
  Beat the dough hard against the sides of the mixing bowl to soften
  and make it elastic. Add more of the water to soften the dough.
  Continue beating and adding water until the mixture becomes very
  elastic and has a consistency of heavy cream. Use only enough water
  to achieve this consistency. Heat a frying pan greased with pork fat
  and pour in about 2 tablespoons of the thin batter, tilting the pan
  to spread the batter as thin as possible. Turn the wrapper when it
  can be freed from the frying pan And fry quickly on the other side.
  Remove from pan. Do the same with the rest of the batter.
  
  To serve, put 2 tablespoons of lumpia mixture in each wrapper and
  fold into a tight roll. Serve with lumpia sauce.

      1 ea Text recipe
 
  A near-empty refrigerator can breed creativity:
  
  1.  Mix some ff plain yogurt with dill weed, celery seed, and a little
  salt. Put it in a small container.
  
  2.  Put some cooked brown rice in another, larger container.
  
  3.  At lunchtime, mix the seasoned yogurt into the rice. At 6:30 this
  morning I thought, "Girl, you MUST be desperate." At 1:00 this
  afternoon I enjoyed a delicious lunch.

      Title: LUNCH SUGGESTIONS
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Cooked rice
      1    Curry powder
      1    Frozen spinach
      1 cn Garbanzos
      1    Raisins
 
  Valerie's lunch: Fill a Tupperware container halfway with cooked
  rice, and use frozen peas (straight out of the bag) to fill it the
  rest of the way. Sprinkle curry powder on top (I use about a
  Tablespoon. YMMV). Take to work, and nuke it at lunch.
  
  My adaptation: Add some frozen spinach (see *below), some canned
  garbanzos, and some raisins (especially golden raisins).
  
  I started adding those other veggies, because my sister told me that
  green peas don't contain many nutrients. They also really add to the
  taste, especially the garbanzo beans.
  
  *Regarding frozen spinach:  You may have already known this, but I
  only recently discovered that you can buy frozen spinach in bags
  ("Family Size") instead of in those famous blocks. The spinach is
  still all frozen in clumps, but the clumps are a manageable size, so
  that I can add just a little to my various dishes.  I now use much
  more spinach than I did before because it is so convenient.

  then dump it on near the end and only cook it down a little.
  
  I'm new to this list and to some of the concepts, so if I've used any
  evil ingredients, sorry.

  Found a real gem of Americana last weekend.  It's a cookbook of Grange
  recipes.  For those from other parts of the world (and big US
  cities), a grange is an association of farmers++they were big in the
  past in the US. This is American heartland cooking++long an canned
  stuff and casseroles. The seafood section was understandably
  short++two pages in a book of some 300 odd pages. But a couple of the
  entries caught my eye. This one for Lutefisk looks particularly
  interesting. Any recipe that calls for sawing one of the main
  ingredients naturally catches my eye.
  
  Now, I've never had Lutefisk in spite of being half Swedish. Both
  sides of my family were busy becoming Americans and none of the
  ethnic delicacies made it down to us third generation kids. Being a
  full- fledged, All-American boy, I naturally resent being deprived of
  my roots and am eager to sue someone for the grievous affront of
  never having had lutefisk when I was growing up. Can't for the life
  of me figure out who to sue though...
  
  Traditional on Christmas Eve.  (Dried Imported Cod)
  
  Saw fish into 3 parts, clean thoroughly and place in a wooden bowl or
  pail. Add water to cover and set in a cool place for 5 to 6 days.
  Change water each day. Remove fish and thoroughly clean wooden bowl.
  Make a solution of water, lime and ashes and allow to stand
  overnight. Drain off clear liquid and pour over soaked fish, set in a
  cool place for 7 days. When fish is soft, remove from solution, scrub
  bowl well and soak fish for several days in cold clear water.  Cook
  in boiling salted water at simmering temperature for about 20
  minutes. Drain well and serve. The Norwegians serve the fish with
  melted butter; the Swedes serve it with white or mustard sauce. Allow
  1/3 pound per person.
  
  MUSTARD SAUCE:
  
  Melt 1 1/2 T. butter, blend in flour, salt and pepper, add fish stock
  gradually, stirring constantly until thickened then cook for an
  additional 3 minutes.  Add mustard and remaining butter. Serve with
  boiled lutfisk, haddock or cod.
  
  Makes 2 1/2 cups sauce.
  
  NOTE:  If fish stock is salty do not add salt listed.

 Categories: Bbq sauces, Pork
      Yield: 6 Servings

MMMMM-------------------FLORIDA BARBECUE SAUCE------------------------
      2 c  Margarine or butter
      1 c  Cider vinegar
      1 c  Catsup
      6 oz Jar Prepared horseradish
      6    Limes or lemons (the juice)
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Worcestershire sauce
      1 ts Hot pepper sauce
 
  PREPARE FLORIDA BARBECUE SAUCE: In a medium stainless-steel or
  enamelware saucepan melt margarine or butter slowly. Add vinegar,
  catsup, horseradish, lime or lemon juice, salt and Worcestershire and
  pepper sauces. Simmer uncovered 20 to 25 minutes to blend flavors.
  Use as basting sauce for pork, chicken or other meats and serve as a
  table sauce. Leftover sauce can be refrigerated and kept up to a
  week. NOTE: If using this sauce for chicken, lemons are better than
  limes; limes give a pleasant tang to pork and other meats.
  DIRECTIONS: Place ribs about 6 inches above hot coals. Brush lightly
  with sauce and brown on one side. Keep a water bottle handy when
  using this sauce as it causes flames to shoot up. Turn, brush again
  with sauce, and brown the other side.  Continue turning and basting
  every 10 minutes until ribs are done, about 1 hour. Check by cutting
  near bone in a center section.  If juices run clear or golden the
  ribs are done. Remove ribs to a platter. Cut into 1- to 3-rib
  sections and serve with any remaining sauce.

      Title: LUXE LAYER EXTRAVAGANZA
 Categories: Cakes, Chocolate
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Boiling water
    1/2 c  Unsweetened cocoa powder
    2/3 c  Buttermilk
  1 2/3 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Butter, softened (1 stick)
  1 1/3 c  Granulated sugar
      3    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla
           RASPBERRY FILLING:
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
    1/4 c  Water
      1 c  Heavy cream
      2 tb 10 X (confectioners') sugar
      1 ts Vanilla
      4    Egg whites
    1/8 ts Cream of tartar
      1 c  Raspberries
      1 ts Grenadine
           Garnish (Optional): whipped
           -cream, orange zest,
           Fresh raspberries
 
  CHOCOLATE CAKE:
  
  PREPARE THE CAKE:  Grease a 15 x 10 x 1-inch baking pan. Line with
  waxed paper.  Grease the waxed paper. Preheat the oven to moderate
  (350F).
  
  Pour the boiling water over the cocoa powder in a medium-size bowl;
  stir to dissolve the cocoa.  Stir in the buttermilk; the mixture
  should be cool. Sift the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt
  onto a sheet of waxed paper.
  
  Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at
  medium speed until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time,
  beating after each addition. Add the vanilla. Beat the dry
  ingredients into the butter mixture, alternating with the cocoa
  mixture, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Pour into the
  prepared pan.
  
  Bake for 20 minutes or until the center springs back when lightly
  pressed. Cool the cake in the pan on a large wire rack for 10
  minutes. Turn the cake out onto the rack to cool completely. Remove
  the waxed paper.
  
  PREPARE THE FILLING:  Heat the granulated sugar and water to boiling
  in a very small saucepan over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the
  sugar. Boil until the temperature registers 240 F on a candy
  thermometer, about 10 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, beat the heavy cream, 10 X sugar, and vanilla in a small
  bowl until stiff.  Cover and refrigerate.
  
  Using clean beaters, beat together the egg whites and cream of tartar
  in a large bowl until soft peaks form. Slowly beat the hot syrup into
  the egg whites, beating until the meringue forms stiff peaks and is
  cool.
  
  Place the raspberries in a blender or food processor. Whirl for about
  5 seconds to puree.  Fold the raspberries and grenadine into the
  whipped cream. Gently fold the meringue into the raspberry cream. Set
  aside.
  
  ASSEMBLE THE CAKE:  Cut the cake crosswise into three equal
  rectangles (5 x 10 inches).  Place one rectangle on a serving
  platter. Top with 2 cups of the filling. Repeat two more times,
  ending with a layer of raspberry cream. Garnish with whipped cream,
  orange zest, or fresh raspberries, if you wish.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

      Title: LUXEMBOURGLI (RASPBERRY FILLED SANDWICH COOKI
 Categories: Cookie/bars, Sweden
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  Blanched almond slices
           -(about 4 ounces)
      1 c  Powdered sugar
    1/2 c  Egg whites (4 to 5),
           -completely free of yolk
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Cream of tartar
    1/4 ts Vanilla extract
    1/8 ts (scant) almond extract
           FOR THE RASPBERRY
           -BUTTERCREAM:
  6 1/2 tb Unsalted butter, slightly
           -softened
  1 1/4 c  Powdered sugar
    1/3 c  Seedless raspberry preserves
           -or jam
 
  FOR THE COOKIES:
  
  Heat the oven to 325F.  Line 2 very large baking sheets (or 3 smaller
  ones) with baking parchment. Toast the almonds in the oven, stirring
  occasionally, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until tinged with brown. Set
  aside to cool.  Reset the oven to 300F.
  
  Grind the cooled almonds and 1/2 cup of powdered sugar in a food
  processor until very fine but not oily. Thoroughly stir the remaining
  powdered sugar into the almonds.
  
  Combine the granulated sugar and 3 tablespoons of hot tap water in a
  small heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring just to a boil,
  stirring. Cover the pan and boil for 1 1/2 minutes to allow the steam
  to wasu the sugar crystals from the sides of the pan.  Uncover and
  continue boiling, lifting the pan and swirling the contents
  occasionally, but never stirring, for about 1 minute longer until the
  syrup thickens, bubbles vigorously, and reaches the firm ball stage
  (240 F on a candy thermometer). To test for doneness without a
  thermometer, remove the pan from the heat and drop a small amount of
  the syrup into a cup of ice water; let stand for 10 seconds.  The
  syrup should form a firm ball when squeezed between the fingers.  Set
  the syrup aside.
  
  Beat the egg whites with an electric mixer on medium speed until
  frothy. Add the cream of tartar, raising the mixer speed to high.
  Continue beating just to soft peaks; turn off mixer. Return the syrup
  to the burner and reheat just to simmering.  With the mixer on high
  speed, immediately pour a thin, steady stream of syrup down the side
  of the bowl (avoid the beaters or whip as the syrup will stick) until
  all of the syrup is added. Add the vanilla and almond extracts.
  Continue beating until the mixture cools to lukewarm.
  
  Use a rubber spatula to fold the almond mixture evenly into the
  beaten egg whites.  Immediately drop the mixture from small spoons
  into 1-inch kisses spacing about 3/4 inch apart on the parchment
  lined baking sheets. (Alternately, pipe the mixture into 1-inch
  rounds using a pastry bag fitted with a plain or open star 3/8-inch
  diameter tip.) Place the pans staggered on racks in the center half
  of the oven.  Bake for 19 to 22 minutes, reversing pans from front to
  back and switching racks about halfway through, until barely tinged
  and firm on top but still slightly soft inside. Let the pans stand on
  wire racks until the meringues are completely cooled.  Peel from the
  paper.  Store aiftight until assembled.
  
  To prepare the buttercream:  Beat togather the butter, powdered
  sugar, and preserves until light and fluffy. Spread with a knife (or
  pipe using a pastry bag and tibe) small amounts of the cream over the
  flat sides of half the cookies.  Top with the r4emaining meringues,
  pressing together tightly. Store the cookies airtight and
  refrigerated for up to 24 hours; they will soften too much if left
  longer.  (For longer storage, freze, tightly wrapped, for up to 2
  weeks; thaw just before serving.) Allow the cookies to warm up
  slightly before serving.
  
  Makes about forty 1 1/4-inch sandwich cookies.

      Title: LYONNAISE SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter
      2 lg Onions, Chopped
    1/2 c  Dry White Wine
      1 c  Basic Brown Sauce (See
           -Sauces)
      1 tb Chopped Fresh Parsley
 
  Onions play a large part in the hearty cooking of the region of Lyon,
  France.  This sauce incorporates the sweetness of fresh onions in a
  base of brown sauce, and is really an all-around accompaniment. Try
  it on eggs, over cooked vegetables, with cold roast meats, grilled
  chops----nearly everything that's full flavored.
  
  Melt the butter in a medium-size heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add
  the onions and saute gently until golden, about 10 minutes. Stir in
  the wine and cook over high heat until the liquid is reduced by half.
  Pour in the brown sauce and simmer over low heat for 15 minutes. Add
  the parsley, cook 1 minute longer, and serve immediately.
  
  Yield:  About 2 cups of sauce.

 Categories: Swedish, Meats, Appetizers, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2    Swedish meatball recipe
      3 lg Onions; yellow (1/2 lb ea);
           -peeled
      3 tb Butter
      2 tb Fresh bread crumbs
 
  Place the peeled onions in a 2 or 3 quart pot, add enough cold water
  to cover and bring to a boil over moderate heat. Lower the heat and
  simmer the onions, uncovered, for 40 minutes. Remove them from the
  pot, drain and let cool on a platter while you make the meat stuffing
  (see recipe). Pull off each onion layer separately. They should slide
  off quite easily. Cut the largest outer layers of the onions in half,
  but remember to leave them large enough to enclose the stuffing.
  Discard the inner part of the onions (or use them for some other
  purpose) if the leaves are too small to stuff. Put a heaping teaspoon
  of the meat stuffing in the middle of each onion leaf and enclose it
  by folding over the edges of the leaf. At this poinnt they may be
  covered with plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days before
  cooking. Preheat oven to 400øF. In a shallow flameproof baking dish,
  melt 3 tablespoons of butter over low heat. Remove the dish from the
  heat and place the onion rolls, sealed side down, side by side in the
  butter, first rolling each in the butter to coat it. Bake 15 minutes,
  then baste with butter in the dish, sprinkle with bread crumbs and
  bake another 15 minutes until the onions are lightly browned and the
  crumbs crisp. Lkdolmar may be served as part of a smrgsbord or as
  a main dish.

      3 c  Granulated sugar
    3/4 c  Light corn syrup
    3/4 c  Water
    1/8 ts Salt
      3    Egg whites
    1/3 c  Semisweet chocolate chips
      2    Bags milk chocolate chips
           (12-ounce bags)

  to harden to the consistency of dough. This may take as long as 20
  minutes.  At this point, add the semisweet chocolate chips.  Remember

  chocolate is added. 5.  When the chocolate is thoroughly blended and
  the nougat has thickened, press it into a greased 9x9-inch pan.
  Refrigerate until firm, about 30  minutes. 6. With a sharp knife, cut
  the candy in half down the middle of the pan. Then cut across into 7
  segments to create a total of 14 bars. 7.  Melt the milk chocolate
  chips in the microwave for 2 minutes on half  power, stirring halfway
  through the heatingtime. Melt completely, but be careful not to
  overheat. 8. Resting a bar on a fork (and using your fingers if

 Categories: Candy, Top secret, Choc
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    1/4 c  Light corn syrup
      2 tb Butter, softened
      1 ts Vanilla extract
    1/8 c  Creamy peanut butter
           -dash salt
      3 c  Powdered sugar
     35    Unwrapped Kraft caramels
      1 c  Dry-roasted unsalted peanuts
     12 oz Milk-chocolate chips
 
  With the mixer on high speed, combine the corn syrup, butter, vanilla,
  peanut butter, and salt until creamy. Slowly add the powdered sugar.
  When the mixture has the consistency of dough, remove it from the
  bowl with your hands and press it into a lightly greased 9x9" pan.
  Set in the refrigerator.
  
  Melt the caramels in a small pan over low heat.  When the caramel is
  soft, mix in the peanuts.  Pour the mixture over the refrigerated
  nougat in the pan.  Let this cool in the refrigerator.
  
  When the refrigerator mixture is firm, melt the chocolate over low
  heat in a double boiler or in a microwave oven set on high for 2
  minutes. Stir halfway through cooking time.
  
  When the mixture in the pan has hardened, cut into 2x1" sections.
  
  Set each chunk onto a fork and dip into the melted chocolate. Tap the
  fork against the side of the bowl or pan to knock off any excess
  chocolate. Then place the chunks on waxed paper to cool at room
  temperature (less than 70 degrees.)  This could take several hours,
  but the bars will set best this way.  You can speed up the process by
  placing the bars in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

      Title: MA LA OIL "CHINA MOON"
 Categories: Condiments, China
      Yield: 2 1/2 cups
 
      1 c  Oil, Corn or Peanut
      1 c  Oil, Sesame, Japanese
    1/2 c  Scallions, green & white
           - cut in rings
     15    Ginger quarter-size coins
           - smashed
      2 tb Peppercorns, Szechwan brown
    2/3 c  Chile Flakes, dried red
           -shockingly pungent
      2 ts Salt, Kosher
 
  Combine all ingredients in a heavy, non aluminum 1 1/2 quart
  saucepan. Rest a deep-fry thermometer on the rim of the pot. Over
  moderately low heat, bring the mixture to a bubbly 225 degrees
  stirring occasionally. Let simmer for 15 minutes, checking to ensure
  the temperature does not rise. Remove from the heat and let stand
  until cool or overnight.
  
  Strain the oil without pressing the solids; then, discard the solids.
  Store the oil in an impeccably clean glass jar at cool room
  temperature.
  
  Because of the large proportion of sesame oil, this is a rich oil. A
  little bit goes a long way. A spoonful added to a salad dressing or
  brushed on the plate on which a fish will steam or on the skin of a
  just smoked or roasted bird gives an inimitable touch of lushness. If
  you are a bread baker, brush a bit on your next loaf, if you are
  tossing pasta, drizzle a bit on the noodles just before serving.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
    750 g  Semolina
      1 c  Sugar
    500 g  Butter
    500 g  Walnuts
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Cold water
    1/2 ts Rosewater
 
  Mix thoroughly in a large bowl 750 g semolina and 1 cup sugar. Melt
  500 g butter until bubbling, then blend it into the semolina-sugar
  mixture. Knead well then set aside for at least one hour or up to 24.
  
  Knead the mixture again then pour in enough boiling water to make a
  soft, pliable dough (wear rubber gloves so you can handle the hot
  mixture).
  
  Crush 500 g walnut pieces finely (this can be done in a food
  processor) and add to 1/2 a cup of sugar. Mix 1/4 of a cup of cold
  water with half a teaspoon of rosewater (any Lebanese or Asian food
  store) and mix the liquid into the walnut-sugar mix- ture.
  
  Mould the pastry into balls about 5 cm in diameter. Make a cavity in
  the centre of each ball with your finger and fill with walnut
  mixture. Close the pastry over the top of the filling and flatten the
  stuffed pastry ball a little between your hands. Make a design on top
  with the tines of a fork
  
  Place these cakes on an ungreased baking tray and cook at 230 C until
  lightly browned, approximately 20 minutes. Store in an airtight
  container and sift icing sugar generously over the top of each layer
  of cakes.

 Categories: Tahiti, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2    Dozen ma'oa [turbot snails]
           -or pahua [clams]
    500 g  Taioro [juice of grated
           -coconuts, seawater and
           -shrimps]
      3    Onions
      2    Garlic cloves
           Salt and pepper
 
  Here's an illustrative recipe from "Tahitian Cooking".
  
  The turbot snails are available around here++in pet stores for
  something like eight bucks a pop!  They might be available in a
  Chinese seafood market for a reasonable price. I'll check the next
  time I'm up that way.
  
  The snail of the ma'oa may be extracted from the shell either by
  breaking the shells with a hammer or by boiling them for a few
  minutes if you wish to keep the shells intact. Wash the snails and
  remove the pocket of black matter.  In the case of the pahua, a
  bivalve, the muscle adhering to the shell should be severed, the
  animal extracted from the shell, and the black matter removed.  Soak
  in fresh water for a few hours. Mix with the taioro, then add the
  chopped onions and garlic plus seasoning. Serve at room temperature.
  [Note that there's no mention of actually cooking the stuff... S.C.]

      1 ts To 2 ts salt, depending on
           -the saltiness of the
           -hot bean sauce
      1 tb Rice wine or dry sherry
      1 tb Soy sauce
    1/2 ts Ground szechwan pepper
      4 tb To 5 tb cooking oil

MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
      2 tb Finely chopped garlic (never
           -cook without it.. (g))
      1 ts Fermented black beans (works
           -well)
      2    To 3 dried or fresh
           -mushrooms (so-so in it)
      6    To 8 pieces wood ear (I
           -think these taste like
           -rubber)
      1 tb Sesame oil (include)
 
  (this dish should be VERY hot)
  
  TO PREPARE: 1. Cut the bean curd into small cubes. If desired, palce
  the bean curd in boiling water in a wok or pot and boil until the
  bean curd starts to float. This procedure firms the bean curd
  slightly and is especially advisable if you are using soft japanese
  style bean curd. 2. Chop the pork into small pieces, about 1/4 inch
  by 1/4 inch, or slightly smaller. Chop the green onion coarsly. Chop
  the ginger as finely as possible. 3. Mix the SEASONINGs in a cup,
  first dissolving the cornstarch in water and then adding the other
  ingredients.
  
  TO COOK: 1. Heat 4-5 tbsps cooking oil in a wok or large frying pan
  until very hot. (This recipe actually calls for rendered pork fat,
  but I invariably use vegetable oil and fatty pork instead.) Add the
  pork pieces and cook briefly. Then add the hot bean sauce, stir and
  add the chopped ginger. Stir until the meat and ginger have absorbed
  the red color from the hot bean sauce. Add 1 cup of stock or water.
  Then carefully add the bean curd cubes and stir gently. 2. Allow the
  liquid in the wok to cook down somewhat, keeping it over medium
  flame. Stir occasionally, being careful not to break the bean curd
  cubes. Just before the liquid has cooked away, stir the seasonings
  and add the green onion. Stir, check for salt. The consistency should
  now be very thick, almost custard like. If necessary add a tbsp or so
  more cornstarch first mixing it with a few tbsps of water to make a
  thin paste. Sprinkle ground Szechwan pepper over the bean curd. Serve
  hot. Should be eaten on top of rice.

      Title: MACADAMIA BAVARIAN CREAM PIE
 Categories: Pies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
    1/4 ts Baking soda
    3/4 c  Coarsely chopped unsalted
           -macadamia nuts
    1/4 c  Water
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 tb Butter
           FILLING:
    1/2 ts Gelatin
      1 tb Dark rum
      1 c  Milk
      6 tb Sugar, divided
      3    Eggs, separated
      1 tb Cornstarch
      2 tb Butter
    3/4 c  Coarsely chopped macadamia
           -nut brittle
    3/4 c  Heavy cream
      1 ts Vanilla
           One 9-inch baked pie shell
           TOPPING:
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
           NUT BRITTLE:
           Unflavored vegetable oil
 
  This pie has a crisp, golden crust and a delicious creamy filling
  dotted with nut brittle. It's a perfect ending to a simple meal.
  
  Macadamia brittle: Spread a thin film of vegetable oil on a baking
  sheet. Sprinkle baking soda over nuts in a small bowl.
  
  Combine water and sugar in a 1 1/2 quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and
  place over low heat; swirl to moisten the sugar. Heat until the sugar
  dissolves. Add the butter, raise heat to medium, and boil the mixture
  until it registers 280 degrees F. on a candy thermometer, 5 to 7
  minutes.
  
  Remove from heat, immediately add nuts, and stir briefly just to
  combine. (Too much stirring will deflate the brittle.) The mixture
  will foam. Pour onto the oiled baking sheet. Set aside to cool and
  harden.
  
  When completely cool, store in an airtight metal container for up to 1
  month at room temperature. Makes
        1    cup.
  
  Filling: Sprinkle gelatin over rum to soften. Combine the milk with 2
  tablespoons of the sugar in a 1 1/2 quart saucepan. Set over medium
  heat and bring to a boil. Whisk the egg yolks with 2 tablespoons
  sugar and the cornstarch in a small bowl. When the milk boils, remove
  from heat, and pour about half into the yolk mixture, whisking to mix
  completely. Pour this mixture into the milk, return to medium heat
  and cook, whisking constantly as mixture begins to thicken. Whisk
  until mixture is smooth and very thick; remove from heat. Add gelatin
  and stir until dissolved. Add butter, and whisk until melted.
  
  Pour into a bowl to cool. Place plastic wrap on top of the cream to
  prevent a film from forming.
  
  When cool, chop brittle in food processor into coarse piec- es, about
  1 cup. Reserve 1/4 cup for decoration. Whip the 3/4 cup heavy cream
  with vanilla until very soft peaks form. Whip egg whites with 1
  tablespoon sugar until stiff, shiny peaks form. Fold brittle into the
  cream filling. Then fold in the whites alternately with the whipped
  cream. Pour filling into the cooled baked crust. Refrigerate at least
  1 hour, or until set. Cover with plastic wrap.
  
  Topping: Whip cream with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar until soft peaks
  form, then spread over pie. Sprinkle the reserved brittle on top. PER

      Title: MACADAMIA CHIFFON PIE
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Finely chopped macadamia nut
    1/4 c  Cold water
      2 ts Unflavored gelatin
      4    Egg yolks
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Boiling water
      5 tb Dark rum
      1 ts Lemon zest
      4    Egg whites
           Pinch of salt
      1    Pie shell, short crust, 10"
    1/2 c  Heavy cream, chilled
      2 tb Superfine sugar
 
    Pour 1/4 cup cold water into a heatproof glass measuring cup,
  sprinkle in the gelatin and let soften 2-3 minutes. Set the cup in a
  skillet of simmering water and stir the gelatin over low heat until
  it dissolves. Remove skillet from heat, but leave the cup in to keep
  the gelatin warm.
    With a whisk or electric beater, beat the yolks until well blended.
  Slowly add 1/4 cup of the regular sugar and continue beating until the
  yolks are thick enough to fall in a ribbon when the beater is lifted
  from the bowl. Beating constantly, pour in the boiling water in a
  thin stream then pour the mixture into a 1 1/2 to 2 quart enemeled or
  stainless steel saucepan. Stir over low heat until it thickens into a
  custard heavy enough to coat the spoon. Do not let custard boil, or
  it may curdle. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the dissolved
  gelatin, then strain the custard through a fine sieve set over a deep
  bowl and add 3 tablespoons of the rum and the lemon peel. Let the
  custard cool to room temperature, stirring occassionally to prevent
  it from setting.
    In a seperate bowl, beat egg whites and salt with a clean whisk or
  beater until they are frothy. Sprinkle in the remaining regular sugar
  and continue beating until the whites form peaks. Stir about 1/4 of
  the whites into the custard, then pour it over the remaining egg
  whites and fold together with a spatula. Fold in 1 1/4 cup of the
  nuts, pour the chiffon mixture into the pie shell and smooth the top
  with the spatula. Refigerate until served.
    Just before serving, beat the heavy cream with a wire whisk or mixer
  until it thickens. Add the superfine sugar and the remaining 2
  tablespoons rum, continue beating until the cream is stiff. With a
  spatula, spread the cream over the pie, sprinkle remaining nuts over
  the top.

      1 c  Finely chopped macadamia
           Pieces
  1 1/4 c  Unbleached -- allpurpose
           Flour
    1/8 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
      1    Stick unsalted butter --
           Melted and cooled
           Macadamia Rum Filling:
  1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
    1/3 c  Water
  1 1/2    Envelopes unflavored gelatin
      4    Egg yolks
    1/3 c  Dark rum
    1/2 c  Light brown sugar
    1/2 c  Chopped -- toasted
           Macadamias
      1 c  Heavy cream -- for finishing
           Optional
 
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. For the crumb crust, combine the
  nuts, flour, salt, sugar, and cinnamon in a mixing bowl, and stir to
  mix well. Stir in the melted butter and continue stirring until the
  mixture has absorbed the butter. Break the mixture into even 1/2 to
  1/4 inch crumbs, rubbing with the fingertips. Place half the crumb
  mixture into a 9 inch Pyrex pie pan and press with the fingertips to
  line the pan evenly. Place the remaining crumb mixture, in an even
  1/2inch layer on a cookie sheet. Bake the crust and crumbs on the
  middle rack of the oven about 20 minutes, until crisp and light
  golden in color. Cool the crust and crumbs on racks. For the Mousse
  Filling, whip the cream until it holds soft peaks and set it aside in
  the refrigerator. Sprinkle the gelatin on the water in a small,
  heatproof bowl. Allow to soak 5 minutes, then place over a small pan
  of simmering water to melt while preparing the filling. When the
  gelatin is melted, remove from the pan and allow to cool. In the bowl
  of an electric mixer, or another heatproof bowl, whisk the egg yolks.
  Whisk in the rum, then the sugar. Place over a pan of gently
  simmering water and whisk constantly until thickened, about 3
  minutes. If the yolk mixture becomes too hot, it may scramble. Remove
  the bowl from the water and beat by machine, on medium speed, until
  cooled to room temperature. Whisk in the dissolved gelatin, then fold
  in the whipped cream and the chopped nuts. Pour the filling into the
  cooled shell and smooth the top. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and
  chill until set at least 6 hours. To finish the pie, top with the
  baked crumbs. Or whip the optional cream, spread half on the mousse
  and top with the crumbs. Then, pipe a border of rosettes of the
  remaining cream around the edge of the pie with a pastry bag fitted
  with a star tube. Yield: one 9 inch pie

      Title: MACADEMIA-ORANGE COOKIES
 Categories: None
      Yield: 30 Cookies
 
MMMMM------------------------COOKIE DOUGH-----------------------------
      4 oz Unsalted butter, softened
      2 tb Sugar
      1 ts Pure vanilla extract
      1 c  Flour
      1 c  Macadamia nuts, chopped

MMMMM--------------------CANDIED ORANGE RIND-------------------------
      2 sm Oranges
      1 c  Sugar
      4 oz White chocolate, melted
 
  1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. For cookie dough, beat the butter
  with the sugar and the vanilla extract until light. Add the flour and
  the nuts. Mix until combined. Chill the dough in the freezer 10
  minutes.
  
  2. Using your hands, roll pieces of the dough into 3/4-inch-diameter
  balls. Place them 2 inches apart on a parchment-covered baking sheet.
  Flatten slightly. Bake until just beginning to brown lightly, about
  15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
  
  3. Meanwhile, for candied orange rind, put 4 cups of water into a
  saucepan over high heat. Cut the oranges in half crossways, and scoop
  out the flesh with a spoon (save flesh for other use). Slice the
  rinds into 1/8-inch- to 1/4-inch-thick strips. Place them in the
  saucepan. Boil 25 minutes; drain.
  
  4. Rinse the strips and return them to the pan with the sugar and 1
  3/4 cups water. Simmer over medium to low heat 25 minutes. Strain the
  strips from the syrup, allow strips to cool, and save for final
  assembly.
  
  5. To assemble the cookies, dip the bottom of the cookie and 1/4 inch
  up the sides into the white chocolate. Tap off any excess chocolate.
  
  6. Put dipped cookies onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Press an
  orange-rind strip around the bottom of each cookie, adhering it to the
  cookie where the chocolate coats the sides. Chill and serve within a
  few hours.

      Title: MACARONI & CHEESE
 Categories: Entrees, Mom
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     16 oz Macaroni, large elbow
     16 oz Cheddar, sharp; halved
      3 c  Milk, whole
      6 lg Eggs
      2 ts Worcestershire sauce
      5 dr Louisiana hot sauce
      1 tb Mustard, dry
      1 ts Salt
        ds Pepper
           Paprika
 
  Boil macaroni and drain.  Slice 8 oz. sharp cheddar in 1/4" thick
  pieces and set aside.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  
  Place additional 8 oz. of sharp cheddar in food processor and pulse 4
  or 5 times.  Add milk, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, Louisiana hot
  sauce, mustard, salt and a dash pepper.  Blend well; cheese should be
  well-processed.
  
  Put cooked macaroni in glass casserole.  (My mom always used one of
  those square ones.  For a half batch, my glass "loaf pan" that holds
  one quart is perfect.)  Pour liquid over macaroni, making sure
  mixture is incorporated well.  Pave the top with the reserved cheese
  and bake for about an hour, 'till custard sets and top is golden. Can
  sprinkle top with paprika for visual interest about 10-15 minutes
  before done.
  
  Vicki's notes:
  
  *  This happens to be one of my major comfort foods (why is it always
  the ones so high in fat?), tho' I usually halve this recipe b/c there
  are only two of us...
  
  *  Can top with 1/2 C bread crumbs tossed in 2 T butter and brown
  under broiler at end of cooking time.
  
  *  Instead of casserole, turn macaroni into hollowed tomatoes and bake
  approximately 15 minutes.

      1 ts Salt

      2 tb Butter
    3/4 c  Shredded Cheddar cheese
 
  Cook macaroni according to package directions.
  
  In large saucepan, melt butter.  Add onion and cook until tender.
  Stir in flour, salt. mustard, salt and pepper. All milk slowly,
  stirring constantly, and cook until sauce is thickened and bubbly.
  Add cheese and stir until melted.  Combine cooked macaroni and cheese
  mixture and mix well. Pour into buttered casserole. (I use one that's
  about 12" square). Top with topping and bake in 375 oven for 20 - 25
  minutes.
  
  To make topping:  tear roll apart and use steel blade of food
  processor to chop into fine bread crumbs. Melt better in small
  saucepan then add crumbs and toss until covered with butter. Combine
  buttered crumbs with cheese and spread over casserole.
  
  I generally serve this with sauteed Kielbasa.
  
  Kraft's Macaroni and Cheese is great and I always have boxes in the
  cupboard as it's something my son can make in a hurry. However, "sure
  doesn't compare to Mom's!"
  
  As with many of my recipes, I evolved this from one I originally

   8. Sprinkle 1/2 C cheese on top, then 1/4 C bread crumbs.
  
   9. Sprinkle paprika over top.
  
   10. Bake 20-25 minutes in preheated 375 degree oven.
  
   This can be frozen!  If so, add 5 minutes to cooking time, or thaw
  first. This recipe has evolved over the years and in this version
  hass received many raves (she humbly said) I think it's the bread
  crumbs.

           Karen Mintzias
      1 lb Spaghetti or other pasta
    1/2 lb Butter
    1/2 c  Kefalotyri or Parmesan
           -(Grated)
 
  Fill a large deep pot 3/4 full with water.  Add salt and bring to a
  rolling boil.  Add pasta slowly, without breaking the boil. Cook 10
  minutes. Place a colander in sink and turn pasta into it. Rinse under
  hot running water, allowing the water to drain through the spaghetti.
  
  Heat the butter in a small saucepan to a honey brown. Watch it
  carefully for these minutes; it burns quickly and suddenly. Return
  spaghetti to large pot and dribble hot butter over it. Sprinkle with
  half the cheese and toss gently to mix.
  
  Transfer to a large ovenproof platter, sprinkle top with more cheese
  and bake for 10 minutes at 350 F. Serve hot.

 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    100 g  Flaky pastry (3 1/2 oz)
     30 g  Raspberries (1 oz)
    110 g  Sugar (3 3/4 oz)
     75 g  Ground hazelnuts (2 1/2 oz)
      2 x  Egg whites
           Grated rind of 1 lemon
           Caster sugar
           Icing sugar
           Slivered almonds
 
  Puree the raspberries in a liquidiser with 35 g ( 1 1/4 oz) of the
  sugar, then pass the mixture through a tamis.
  
  Prepare a macaroon paste by mixing, with a spatula, the rest of the
  sugar, the ground powered nuts, the egg whites and lemon rind.
  
  Roll out the pastry to a thickness of 2-3 mm ( 1/8 in) and line an 18
  cm ( 7 in) tart tin with a removable base. Prick it all over with the
  prongs of a fork (Put it in a refrigerator if you are not going to
  bake it at once).
  
  Pre-heat the oven to 220 oC/425 oF.
  
  Lightly sprinkle caster sugar over the uncooked pastry, then spread
  the raspberry puree over it in a smooth layer.
  
  Spread the macaroon mixture over the raspberry, smoothing the surface
  with the help of a spatula.
  
  Cook the cake for 40 minutes in the pre-heated oven. Reduce the heat
  to 180 oC/350 oF after 20 minutes if it is browning too quickly. Take
  it out and leave it to cool a little.
  
  Scatter the slivered almonds over the top of the cake while it is
  still warm. Sprinkle the cake with icing sugar then put it under hot
  grill for just long enough to caramelise the sugar lightly. Take
  care, as this takes barely a minute.
  
  Let the cake cool, then take it out of the tin.

  the stuffed peach halves together to form whole peaches, and place
  them in a bowl. To make the sauce, put the raspberries in a blender

      Yield: 30 Servings
 
      3    Egg whites
  1 1/4 ts Lemon juice
    3/4 c  Sugar
  2 1/4 c  Shredded coconut OR chopped
           -hazelnuts,walnuts,almonds.
           Whole hazelnuts
 
  Preheat oven to 325F (165C). Line baking sheet with foil or waxed
  paper; set aside. In a large bowl, beat egg whites and lemon juice
  until stiff peaks form. While continuing to beat, gradually add
  sugar. Fold in coconut or chopped nuts until mixture is evenly
  blended. Drop mixture by teaspoonfuls onto lined baking sheets. Top
  each cookie with a hazelnut. Bake 30 minutes. If cookie starts to
  brown, slightly reduce the oven temperature. Cookies should not
  brown. Remove cookies from baking sheet and place onto cooling racks.
  When cooled store in a tightly sealed container. If cookies are to be
  stored longer than 1 to 2 days, add a lemon or apple wedge to the
  container. This will keep the cookies from becoming hard. Makes
  approximately 30 cookies.

  Macayo Fajitas
  
  (This basic fajita recipe is from the Johnson family which owns the
  Macayo chain.) **
  
  and sliced                         Chopped fresh cilantro
  
  For marinade, in a large bowl, whisk together salt, pepper, lime,
  garlic and vegetable oil.  Put meat in marinade and set aside for at
  least one hour.
  
  Heat oven to 200 degrees; set tortillas in for 1 to 3 minutes, to
  warm. Remove and put in a covered basket.
  
  Heat a large skillet and add olive oil.  Add marinated meat and saute
  until onion becomes transluscent.
  
  Place cooked meat in a large bowl or platter and serve with tortillas,
  toppings and garnishes.
  
  For each fajaita, fill a tortilla with meat and desired amounts of
  garnishes and toppings and roll up like a burrito.
  
  Serve with refried beans, black beans or Spanish rice. Make 4 to 6
  servings.
  
  VARIATIONS: For spicier marinade, add cayenne pepper or crushed dry
  red chili pepper. Instead of lime juice, try pineapple juice, papaya
  juice, beer, wine or barbecue sauce.*
  
  *(Cooks note:) I like to use tequila, and marinate myself a bit while
  I'm doing the cooking. It makes it much easier to roll up like a
  burrito. It is the unrolling that becomes a bit difficult.

  1 1/2 ts Yeast; more or less
    1/2 c  Semolina flour
  1 1/2 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Instant nonfat dry milk soli
      1 tb Unsalted butter
    7/8 c  (1c minus 2T) water
 
  Here's the recipe you requested. This makes one 1 lb loaf on the basic
  bread setting. 1. Place all the ingredients in the bread pan and
  process on the standard bread setting. 2. Remove bread from the pan
  and cool on a rack. Wrap in a plastic bag or foil to store. The
  author says that the addition of semolina flour seems to give the
  bread that close; even grain required for this type of bread. You can
  slice this bread as thin as you like; you can use it for canapes or
  fancy sandwiches; you can make melbas or croutons from it once it's 2
  or 3 days old. Have fun! Sarah\CA Reformatted by Elaine Radis

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
 
        2    Whole chicken breasts
        1 ts Sesame oil
  :          Oil for deep frying in wok
        1 ts Five Spice Powder*
       12    Squares won ton skins --
  :          slice
      1/2 c  Sliced green onion (1
  :          bunch)
        2 oz Rice noodles
      1/4 c  Chopped toasted almonds
      1/4 c  Soy sauce
        1    Head lettuce -- shredded
        1 TB Prepared mustard
  
  Steam chicken breasts or cook in micro until barely done; skin, bone
  and shred (this is easy if you used 2 forks). In medium sized bowl,
  mix soy sauce, mustard, oil and Five SpicePowder (available in Asian
  food sections of most super markets - at least in California) and
  green onions; marinade chicken in this sauce, covered. Heat oil VERY
  hot (drop a piece of won ton skin in - if it floats right back up,
  oil is hot enough). Fry won ton skins until just beginning to turn
  golden; remove with slotted spoon to drain on paper towels (they will
  continue to brown when removed from heat). Fry noodles, a very few at
  a time, in hot oil - they will puff up almost immediately. Remove and
  drain immediately (they will be white). When ready to eat, slice
  lettuce (reserve some whole leaves to garnish bowl) thinly, add
  chicken and marinade, fried won ton skins and fried noodles (crumble
  a little as you add them), and almonds. Serve from large bowl ringed
  with whole lettuce leaves. Converted by MMCONV vers. 1.00

  " "Garam marsala" means "hot spices" and is generally added to foods
  near the end of cooking or as a garnish. This homemade version is
  superior to store bought, which is usually heavy on the cheaper
  spices and not as fresh. Make this in small quantities so that it
  stays fresh. Cardamom seeds (not pods) available in East Indian food
  stores, are used here as they give a more delicate taste. Regular
  cumin seeds can be substituted for the black cumin seeds." Place
  ingredients in clean electric or spice grinder. Turn machine on 30 to
  40 seconds or until spices are finely ground. Store in small jar with
  tightly fitted lid. Keep away from heat and sunlight. MAKES ABOUT 3

      Title: MADISON'S TART DOUGH
 Categories: Pies, Misc
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Unbleached white flour
    3/8 ts Salt
      4 tb Cold unsalted butter;
           - cut into small cubes
  1 1/2 tb Solid vegetable shortening
  2 1/2 tb Ice water, more if necessary
 
  This versatile dough can be the basis for either fruit or meat pies.
  The recipe comes from Deborah Madison's "The Greens Cookbook"
  (Bantam, 1987).
  
  COMBINE THE FLOUR AND SALT in a bowl; then add the butter and
  shortening. With your hands, work the fat and flour together, sliding
  and flattening the mixture between your palms, or thumb and
  fingertips, until the butter and shortening are evenly distributed.
  Add 2 1/2 tablespoons cold water and lightly work it into the flour,
  using your fingers, slightly cupped together, or a fork. Gather the
  dough into a ball, sprinkle a few drops of water over any remaining
  dry ingredients and gather them together. Cover the dough with waxed
  paper or plastic wrap, flatten it into a disk, and let it rest at
  least 30 minutes in the refrigerator before using. The dough can also
  be frozen at this point for future use. When you are ready to roll
  the dough, lightly flour the work surface and the top of the dough.
  If it is stiff from the cold, let it sit for 20 minutes before you
  roll it out. Roll it out with firm, even strokes into a circle about
  1/8-inch thick. Pick it up on the rolling pin and slide it onto the
  pie dish or tart mold. Or, alternatively, fold it into quarters, lay
  it with the point in the center of the pan, then unfold. Trim the
  edges, leaving an overhang of an inch or so; then fold the overhang
  under and crimp the edge. To partially pre-bake the crust, first
  freeze the empty shell until it is quite firm. If you intend to
  freeze the crust for an extended period of time, wrap it in foil.
  When ready to use, preheat the oven to 425F. Set the frozen tart
  shell directly into the oven and bake until the crust has a "set"
  appearance and is just beginning to color, about 8-to-10 minutes.
  While the crust is baking, check to see that the bottom is now
  swelling with steam and air. If it does, prick it lightly with a
  paring knife. More traditionally, the crust may be prebaked unfrozen,
  first lining it with buttered foil, filling the foil with pie weights
  or dry beans, then baking, as above, until the edges are set and
  slighted browned. Makes 1 9-Inch Pie or Tart

      2 ts Ginger, minced
    1/2 c  Oil
           Cider vinegar

  Dust chicken pieces with flour. Heat oil in large saute pan until
  very hot. Cook chicken until browned. Remove chicken. Saute onion and
  garlic until tender. Add curry paste, salt, chili powder. Stir in
  yogurt and tomatoes. Add chicken back in and coat well with sauce.
  Reduce heat to simmer, cover and cook 30-40 minutes. Serve over rice
  (make two cups) with the following condiments: raisins, sliced
  bananas, chopped tomatoes, shredded coconut, chopped green onions,
  chopped peanuts and chutney. For the chutney, I use the
  mango/habanero Island sauce from "Hot Licks". The one with rum in it.
  
  Madras Curry Paste makes 1 1/2 cups
  
  Mix dry spices in a bowl. Add garlic, ginger and enough vinegar to
  make a smooth puree. Heat oil in sauce pan until hot and add spice
  mixture. Reduce heat stirring constantly until oil starts to separate
  from the spices. Allow to cool and remove excess oil. Place in glass
  jar and store refrigerated. Keeps forever. Walt MM

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Millet, rinsed and drained
      2 c  Boiling water
    1/2 lb Beets, scrubbed, trimmed,
           And cut into 1/2*inch dice
           (no need
           To peel.
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Allspice
      1 tb Fresh orange zest
           2 oranges)
      2 tb Minced fresh mint
      6 tb Fresh orange juice
           Salt, to taste
 
  Heat nonstick or cast iron skillet over high heat. Toast millet till
  it gives off a nice popcorn smell and starts to dance about the pan.
  Place millet in pressure cooker pot when done.
  
  Heat flame tamer and place pressure cooker on top. Add boiling water,
  beets, salt, and allspice to pressure cooker. Lock lid and bring up
  to high pressure.  When high pressure is reached, turn down heat to
  maintain pressure and hold for 10 minutes (set a timer).
  
  Meanwhile, zest one of the oranges.  You should get a yield of 1 T,
  if not, use the other orange as well. (If you don't have a zester,
  use a sharp potato peeler to delicately remove just the orange peel,
  leaving the bitter white pith behind.) Mince the orange zest.  Set
  aside. Squish the oranges without breaking them by rolling them
  between your hands and the counter. This will make juicing go easier.
  Cut in half and juice. You should get 6 T or so.  Since oranges vary
  in sweetness, you will want to add the orange juice by taste.
  
  Mince the mint and set aside.
  
  After the 10 minutes are up on the pressure cooker, turn off heat and
  move it to a cold burner.  Let sit for 10 minutes and then take
  cooker to sink. Run under cold water to release any residual pressure
  and remove lid.
  
  Add mint and zest.  Add orange juice to taste, and salt if needed.
  Serve.
  
  This dish looked stunning in my black octagonal serving dish. A
  splash of lemon or lime might also be tasty.

 Categories: Greek, Lamb, Ceideburg
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1    Lamb leg
      1    Lamb liver
      1    Or more lamb heads
           Several lambs' tongues
      1 bn Green onions, finely
           -chopped
           Potatoes
      1 bn Fennel, finely chopped
           Olive oil
           Oregano
           Garlic
      2    Lemons, juice only
    1/2 c  Uncooked rice per person
      3    Eggs
      1 lg Lemon, juice only
 
  Into a large stockpot put sufficient cuts of lamb to feed the number
  of diners.
  
  Aliki uses a leg, a liver, one or more lamb heads cut in half and
  several lambs' tongues (the meat is ordered in advance from a Greek
  butcher in Marrickville). Cover with water and bring to the boil.
  
  Skim the stock, then add a bunch of green (spring) onions and a bunch
  of fennel herb, finely chopped.
  
  Cover and simmer gently until the leg of lamb is cooked, 2-3 hours.
  
  Drain off the lamb stock and reserve.
  
  Finely dice the cooked liver and add it to the lamb stock. Peel the
  skin from the lambs' tongues.
  
  In a very large baking dish, put a generous amount of olive oil,
  oregano, garlic (Aliki does not put in garlic but many do) and the
  juice of 2 lemons.
  
  Turn the lamb leg, tongues and head in this mixture to coat them and
  put them in the centre of the baking dish. Surround the meat with
  potatoes (Aliki puts in pumpkin, too) cut in chunks, turn them in the
  oil and put the dish in a moderate oven until the meats have crisped
  and the potatoes are cooked -- about one hour.
  
  Turn the meat and vegetables midway through cooking.
  
  Meanwhile, measure the-amount of liver-enriched stock neces- sary for

      Title: MAGERETSA & PSITO - LAMB & LEMON SOUP WITH BA
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1    Lamb leg
      1    Lamb liver
      1    Or more lamb heads
           Several lambs' tongues
      1 bn Green onions, finely
           -chopped
           Potatoes
      1 bn Fennel, finely chopped
           Olive oil
           Oregano
           Garlic
      2    Lemons, juice only
    1/2 c  Uncooked rice per person
      3    Eggs
      1 lg Lemon, juice only
 
  Into a large stockpot put sufficient cuts of lamb to feed the number
  of diners.
  
  Aliki uses a leg, a liver, one or more lamb heads cut in half and
  several lambs' tongues (the meat is ordered in advance from a Greek
  butcher in Marrickville). Cover with water and bring to the boil.
  
  Skim the stock, then add a bunch of green (spring) onions and a bunch
  of fennel herb, finely chopped.
  
  Cover and simmer gently until the leg of lamb is cooked, 2-3 hours.
  
  Drain off the lamb stock and reserve.
  
  Finely dice the cooked liver and add it to the lamb stock. Peel the
  skin from the lambs' tongues.
  
  In a very large baking dish, put a generous amount of olive oil,
  oregano, garlic (Aliki does not put in garlic but many do) and the
  juice of 2 lemons.
  
  Turn the lamb leg, tongues and head in this mixture to coat them and
  put them in the centre of the baking dish. Surround the meat with
  potatoes (Aliki puts in pumpkin, too) cut in chunks, turn them in the
  oil and put the dish in a moderate oven until the meats have crisped
  and the potatoes are cooked -- about one hour.
  
  Turn the meat and vegetables midway through cooking.
  
  Meanwhile, measure the-amount of liver-enriched stock neces- sary for
  the number of diners (about one cup per person) and cook in it half a
  cup of rice (preferably short grain) for every 6 people.
  
  Separate 3 eggs and beat the whites until stiff, then add yolks and
  beat again.
  
  Finally, add the juice of a large lemon. Ladle some of the simmering
  soup into the eggs then add the egg mixture back into the soup,
  stirring vigorously.
  
  Adjust the seasoning and serve the soup.
  
  After the soup, serve the roasted meat and potatoes with a simple
  salad (not too oily because the main dish is rich) of lettuce,
  cucumber, radishes and tomatoes.

      Title: MAGERITSA (EASTER LAMB SOUP)
 Categories: Greek, Soups/stews, Lamb
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
           Intestines, heart, lungs,
           & liver of 1 lamb.
           1 lamb's feet and tripe, opt
      1    Lamb's head (optional)
           Salt
      2    Lemons (juice only)
      1 sm Bunch scallions; chopped
    2/3 c  Chopped fresh parsley
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh dill
    1/4 c  Chopped celery leaves
      6 tb Raw long-grain white rice
    1/2 ts Aniseed (optional)
           Freshly ground pepper
      3    Whole eggs
 
  Note: If using the lamb's head, wash it, then soak it in cold water
  for 3 hours. Drain. Cut the head in half, using a sharp knife, and
  tie with a clean string.
  
  If using the lamb's feet and tripe, prepare as follows: If tripe is
  not parially cooked, cut open with a sharp knife and clean the inside
  thoroughly under running water. Put in a pan with cold salted water to
  cover and soak for 30 minutes, then drain and wash with cold water.
  Cut into small pieces and put in a large soup pot with the lamb's
  feet. cover with cold water, and simmer until tender, adding salt to
  taste during the last minutes of cooking. Cube the tripe, remove the
  meat of the feet from the bones, and add to the mageritsa at the same
  time as the cut-up intestines, adjusting the liquid by adding more
  water.
  
  Clean the intestines thoroughly by turning them inside out, using a
  long skewer or stick (this turning will be quicker if the intestines
  are first cut into 2-foot lengths), then wash under cold running
  water until clean. Rub the intestines with salt and the juice of 1/2
  lemon, rinse again in cold water and drain. Braid the intestines or
  tie the ends together with clean string. Put in a large soup pot with
  the lamb's head, if using, and cove with cold water. Bring to a boil,
  then lower the heat, skim, and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove the
  intestines, drain them, and cut into 1/4 inch pieces with the
  scissors and set aside to add to the soup later. (Use the remaining
  portion of the head for another dish.)
  
  Bring the soup stock to a boil and add the scallions, parsley, dill,
  and celery leaves. Cut the heart, lungs, and liver into small
  bite-sized cubes, and add them to the soup, and simmer for 15
  minutes. Add the rice, cut-up intestines, aniseed, salt and pepper to
  taste and continue simmering until the rice is tender, approximately
  15 minutes, adding more water as needed and the brains during the
  last few minutes of cooking.
  
  Half an hour before serving, bring the soup to a boil, then remove
  from the heat and prepare the avgolemono: Beat the eggs for 2
  minutes. Continue to beat, gradually add the remaining lemon juice.
  Then 1 to 2 cups of the hot soup by droplets, beating steadily, until
  all has been added. Add the avgolemono to the soup. Stir over minimum
  heat until thickened. Serve warm but avoid boiling the soup after
  adding the avgolemono.
  
  A richer Mageritsa can be made by sauteing the scallions in 3
  tablespoons butter or oil before adding to the soup.

      Title: MAGGIE MURPHY'S POT OVEN BREAD
 Categories: Ireland, Bread/rolls
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Whole meal irish soda bread
 
       Down yonder in one of our big fields is a lovely mysterious ruin
  of an old house and grist mill--moss covered stone walls, roof fallen
  in over a perfectly arched stone doorway--and at one end of this
  relic is a tiny two-room cottage that was once the miller's cottage.
  There, almost forescore years ago, Maggie Murphy first saw the light
  of day, and there she will live out all the days that are left her.
  Spry as a cricket, she bicycles the five miles into the village once
  a week and peddles back (uphill most of the way) with whole-wheat
  flour among her purchases. She cooks over an open hearth fire and
  mixes her soda bread just as in the recipe for Whole Meal Irish Soda
  Bread, but she has no oven--just a three-legged iron pot oven. She
  sets this right in the red-hot coals on her hearth, rubs it inside
  with a bit of fat pork, drops her cake of whole-wheat dough into it,
  puts on the cover and then shovels some of the red coals onto the
  cover. Heat top and bottom she has, and the bread bakes for an hour
  while she sits by the hearth, from time to time turning the handle on
  her wheel bellows--which makes a draft of air come up through the
  tiny hole under the coals, bring them to life with a golden glow. At
  just the right minute she brushes the hot coals off the cover, lowers
  the crane to catch the handle of the pot and swings it away from the
  fire.
       Out comes a perfectly baked, crusty loaf, fragrant and golden
  "and good enough for the likes of me," says my dear friend, Maggie
  Murphy. SOURCE: Pepperidge Farm Cookbook From the cookbook files of:

      Title: MAGGIE'S APRICOT CREAM
 Categories: Desserts, Vegan
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    175 g  Canned apricots, drained
    300 ml Soya milk
 
  Serves 2-3
  
  This unlikely dessert is simplicity and economy incarnate. Looking at
  the recipe it is hard to believe ~ but it works. The soya milk turns
  to a set cream overnight, and it looks as if you have spent hours
  preparing what probably took 3 minutes. A cooling sweet course, with
  lovely textures.
  
  Slice the canned apricots and put them into the bottom of a
  serving-dish. Pour the milk over them and chill overnight. The soya
  milk will set to a light cream, and the natural sugars in the fruit
  are sufficient sweetness. Lovely textures!

  cured or canned hams.  Just the standard bone in ham in the meat
  counter. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  ++++++++++++++++++ Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
   Place ham, fat side down, in a shallow baking pan.
   Pour coke into pan until it is 1/2-inch deep.  Bake 2 to 3 hours, or
  until ham can be easily pierced with a fork, basting with the
  Coca-Cola every 15 to 20 minutes. (Center of ham will read 140
  degrees F on a meat thermometer when properly cooked.)  Remove ham
  from the pan and cool. Cut away rind and fat with a sharp knife.
  Combine sugar, mustards, bread crumbs, and enough Coke to form a
  thick paste.  Place ham on roasting rack in pan and pat all over with
  the paste.
   Add remaining coke to the bottom of the pan.
   Increase the temperature to 375 degrees F. and bake the ham 45
  minutes longer, basting every 20 to 15 minutes until sugar-mustard
  paste has melted to a dark glaze. Let stand at room temperature 30
  minutes before slicing.

      Title: MAGIC CARAMEL PUDDING (CARAMELIZED EAGLE BRAN
 Categories: Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Remember awhile back there a thread about boiling Eagle Brand
  Sweetened Condensed Milk in the can to caramelize it?
  
  It's popular in Mexico. This weekend I picked up "MAGIC, the most
  AMAZING SHORT-CUTS in cooking you ever heard of".
  
  It's a proprietary cookbook put out in the late teens or early
  twenties by the Borden Company.  The women all look like Betty Boop's
  mother, the stoves all have legs and fridges are referred to as
  "automatic refrigerators" and have ornate hinges and latches. Seems
  like way back in 1857 Gail Borden perfected the technique for canning
  milk and the rest is history. The book presents a series of "magic
  tricks" and then later has recipes that use the end results of the
  "tricks". Anyway, one of the first things I ran across was this
  recipe.
  
  Place one or more unopened cans of Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed
  Milk in a kettle of boiling water and keep at boiling point for three
  hours, being careful to keep can well covered with water.  Chill
  thoroughly.
  
  Remove from can as follows:
  
  Warm can by immersing in hot water about one minute. Punch a hole in
  bottom of can, remove top with can-openeer, cutting along the side,
  just below top edge, starting at seam.  Loosen caramel from sides of
  can with a table knife dipped in hot water.
  
  Turn on to plate. Cut in slices with knife dipped in hot water.
  
  NOTE:  If a pressure cooker is used to caramelize the milk use 15
  pounds pressure for 50 minutes.
  
  As I write this, I'm still savoring the first taste of the finished
  product. It has a rich, butterscotchy flavor and is a nice, very
  light tan color.  The texture is like a pudding. This has definite
  potential!
  
  This is almost as good as chocolate!  In fact, I can feature this as
  being part of fudge.

      Title: MAGIC CHICKEN
 Categories: Fruits, Microwave, Main dish, Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Chicken parts; more or less
  2 1/2 lb Chicken Parts; skinned
      1 qt Orange juice
      1 ts Cinnamon
      1 ts Ginger
    1/2 ts Cloves
    1/2 ts Allspice
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
      1    TO
      3    Garlic cloves
 
  Mix spices (except garlic) together and blend well. Rub in to chicken
  pieces.
  
  Arrange chicken pieces in microwaveable casserole and pour in orange
  juice to cover.
  
  Mince garlic and add to juice, add any remaining spice mixture.
  
  Microwave 30 minutes at 70% power, turning pieces over halfway
  through to ensure even heating.
  
  People watching fat can pull the skin off the chicken (or use skinless
  pieces in the first place); people eating fat can leave it on.
  
  I like to take the cooked pieces and pop them under a broiler for a
  couple of minutes on each side to brown them and crisp them up a bit.
  
  The orange juice can be re-used for up to two subsequent batches,
  though it is kind of ruined for serving at breakfast time.

    3/4 c  Soy sauce
      2 tb Honey
      2 tb Dark brown sugar, packed
      2 sl Bread
      2    Scallions
      2    Parsley
      3 c  Beer
           Sauce:
  1 3/4 c  Brown stock
      2 ts Arrowroot, dissolved in
      3 tb Cold water
           Kumquats for garnish
 
  Rinse ducks, pat dry, and remove excess fat from body cavities. Truss
  the birds.  Arrange them, breast side up, several inches apart on a
  rack set over a large roasting pan. Let them dry, chilled but
  uncovered, for 3 days. In a bowl, combine the Scotch, gingerroot,
  garlic, zest, coriander, peppercorns, soy sauce, honey, and brown
  sugar. Let this mixture stand, covered and chilled, for 3 days.  Stir
  marinade, and press it through a fine sieve into a small bowl.
  Keeping the ducks chilled, brush them with some of the marinade,
  every 30 minutes, for 2-1/2 hours. Let the ducks dry at room
  temperature for 30 minutes. Stuff each duck with one of the bread
  slices, 1 scallion and 1 parsley sprig. Spoon remaining marinade into
  the cavities.  Prick the ducks, except for the breast area, with a
  fork. Pour the beer into the roasting pan. Roast the ducks on the
  rack in the lower third of a preheated 350f oven for 30 minutes. Tent
  birds with foil and roast for 30 minutes more. Discard foil and roast
  for another 30 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers 180f.
  (The skin should be very mahogany colored and crisp.) Remove stuffing
  ingredients with a spoon and discard them and the pan juices. Pour
  the juices from the cavities through a fine sieve into a small bowl.
  Skim the fat, and reserve 1/4 cup of the juices. Arrange ducks on a
  platter and keep them warm, covered loosely. In a saucepan, bring the
  stock to a boil, simmer it for 15 minutes, and stir in reserved
  juices.  Bring the mixture to a simmer. Stir arrowroot mixture and
  add to pan. Cook the mixture over mod-low heat, being careful not to
  boil, until thickened.  Add salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the
  sauce to a heated sauceboat. Garnish the duck with kumquats and serve
  with the sauce. a 1983 Gourmet Mag. favorite

  ====================> Notes and Credits < ===========================
  
  From "The Good Fare and Cheer of Old England" by Joan Parry Dutton
  1960, Published by Reynal & Company, Inc.
  
  It is said that Maids of Honour cakes date from a day in 1525 when
  Henry VIII saw Maids of Honour for one of his six Queens eating a
  platter of cakes with such joyous relish that he tried one himself,
  and found it very good.  Another tradition says they were named for
  Queen Elizabeth's Maids of Honour when she lived at Richmond Palace.
  From "The Cooking of the British Isles, by Adrian Bailey, Time-Life
  Books, 1969
  
  Several towns in Britain make small, delectable tarts known as Maids
  of Honour, but none are so rich in flavor and therefore so famous as
  Richmond Maids of Honour, which come from Richmond, a suburb of
  London, and are said to have been invented for the court of Henry
  VIII in the 16th Century.

  Beat in the sugar until well blended and smooth. Beat in the egg and
  lemon peel. With the mixer at low speed, beat in the flour just until
  evenly incorporated.
  
  Divide the dough in half.  Place each portion between large sheets of
  waxed paper.  Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough to a scant 1/4
  inch thick. Check the undersides and smooth out any wrinkles in the
  waxed paper. Stack the rolled portions on a tray or baking sheet.
  Refrigerate for about 20 minutes or until cold and firm, but not hard.
  
  Heat the oven to 375F.  Working with one chilled portion of dough at
  a time (keep the other one chilled), peel away a layer of waxed
  paper. (This makes it easier to lift the cookies from the paper
  later.) Replace the paper and turn the dough over. Peel of the second
  layer of paper. Using a 2-inch round or scalloped cutter (or a small
  juice of sherry glass) cut out the cookies.  Use a spatula to
  carefully lift the cookies from the paper and place them about 1 inch
  apart on the baking sheets. Reroll the dough scraps between waxed
  paper; rechill in the refrigerator. Repeat the process with the
  second portion of dough.
  
  Working with a few cookies at a time, brush the tops with the egg
  yolk-water mixture using a pastry brush or paper towel. Sprinkle the
  tops lightly with granulated sugar. Repeat until all of the cookies
  are garnished.
  
  Bake the cookies for 6 to 9 minutes or until the top is just tinged
  with brown and slightly darker at the edges. Let cool on the baking
  sheets for about 2 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and let stand
  until thoroughly cool.  Store airtight for up to a week. Freeze for
  longer storage.
  
  Makes 50 to 60 cookies.

      Title: MAIN COURSE SEAFOOD RISOTTO
 Categories: 
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Fish stock or clam juice
           Combined with 5
        c  Water
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/2 c  Finely chopped onion
  1 1/2 c  Short grain rice
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
      2 tb Olive oil
    3/4 lb Shrimp -- peeled and
           Deveined
           Cut into thirds
    3/4 lb Scallops -- foot removed
           And
           Sliced in half,
           Horizontally
      2 tb Butter
           Salt and freshly ground
           Black pepper
      4    Plum tomatoes -- seeded and
           Cut into
           Fine dice
      2 tb Chopped parsley
 
  Set clam juice and broth in a saucepan and have it at a bare simmer
  before you begin. Heat olive oil in a wide saucepan and cook the
  onions for 5 minutes or until lightly golden. Add the rice and stir,
  continuously for a couple of minutes to lightly toast it. Add the
  wine and cook gently until almost entirely evaporated.
  
  Add 1/2 cup of the boiling water and stock and simmer the rice,
  stirring constantly, until all the liquid is absorbed. Add 1/2 cup
  more of simmering liquid and stir the rice until it has again
  absorbed the liquid. Continue in this fashion, adding a cup of liquid
  after 1 1/2 cups are in. When rice is half way done (after about 15
  minutes) cook the seafood.
  
  In another skillet heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and
  saute the shrimp and scallops for a minute or until almost entirely
  cooked. Transfer the seafood to the rice and continue to finish
  cooking the rice until entirely tender (should take about 30 to 35
  minutes in all). When done, the rice is just tender, has absorbed the
  liquid (you may not need it all). Add the butter, season to taste
  with salt and pepper and dish out. Serve immediately or the rice will
  continue to cook and turn to mush. Garnish with tomatoes and parsley.

      1 lb Lean ground beef
    2/3 c  Yellow cornmeal
      1 tb Lime juice
      1    Egg white
      1 ts Ground cumin, or to taste
      2 ts Chili powder
           Salt and pepper to taste
      1    Fresh jalapeno pepper *
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      1 c  Corn kernels **
      1 c  Salsa
      6    10-inch flour tortillas

           -optional
           Lime wedges for garnish
 
  * seeded and finely chopped, or to taste (see note) ** frozen, or

  The crunch of corn with your favorite salsa makes a delicious,
  lower-fat Southwestern hamburger served on a flour tortilla with
  shredded lettuce and lime wedges.
  
  In a mixing bowl, mix lightly the ground beef, cornmeal, lime juice,
  egg white, cumin, chili powder, salt, pepper and jalapeno. Shape into
  6 large thin patties and reserve on a sheet of wax paper.
  
  Over medium-high heat, heat a 12-inch skillet, then add the oil to
  coat the bottom. Place patties in the hot skillet and cook 3 to 5
  minutes per side, turning once, until the meat is cooked through and
  the patties are a deep golden brown.
  
  Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine corn and salsa and heat. In
  the microwave, heat flour tortillas wrapped in a cloth or on paper
  plates for 15 seconds on high.
  
  To serve, place a cooked patty on a flour tortilla, top with a
  serving of salsa and fold. Add shredded lettuce if desired. Serve a
  wedge of lime alongside.
  
  Note: When preparing fresh chilies, wear rubber gloves for protection
  against oils that later can cause burning sensation on skin.

      Title: MAKE A ROUX (JUSTIN WILSON)
 Categories: Cajun, Sauce
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1    Part oil (shortening) bacon
           Drippings, olive oil, cook-
           Ing oil, lard or a combina-
           Tion of these
      2    To 3 parts all purpose flour
 
  If I want a thick roux, I use 3 parts flour to 1 part oil. If I want
  a thin roux, I use 2 parts flour to 1 part oil.
  
  Mix the flour and oil in a heavy pot.  A black iron skillet or a
  Magnalite skillet works best.  Cook on medium heat slowly as the roux
  changes from a cream color all the way to a dark chocolate color.
  After the roux is past a medium brown, you've got to stir the roux
  constantly to keep it from burning.  If you do burn the roux, throw
  it out, wash the pot and start over.  The way I make a roux it takes
  from 45 minutes to more than one hour before it gets dark as I like
  it. I use a dark roux for all my gumbos and sauce piquants. For some
  gravies and sauces it is not as important to make the roux so dark.
  Some milk based soups call for a light colored roux. Even so, I
  usually make my lightest roux about the color of the water in the
  Mississippi at Baton Rouge.
  
  After my roux is cooked as dark as I want it, I add my chopped
  vegetables, like onion, bell pepper, and celery. I stir after each
  addition and love to hear the chopped onions sizzle in the hot roux.
  It starts to smell pretty good when the vegetables are added. Bell
  pepper and celery are taste killers, so don't use too much. You can
  use as much onion as you like. After the vegetables have cooked
  awhile and the onions are clear, put in the chopped parsely and green
  onions. I put in a little cold water or stock and then add fresh
  minced garlic, and stir all the time. After the garlic has cooked
  awhile, I stir in the liquids and all the other ingredients to make a
  gumbo, brown gravy hash or stew.

      Title: MAKING BETTER BUTTER
 Categories: Spreads, Seasonings, Info
      Yield: 1 Info below
 
      1    Info below
 
  "Start with the freshest butter you can find.  I use unsalted butter
  because I like to control the amount of salt (if any) in the finished
  product, and because its flavor is more delicate than that of the
  heavily salted varieties that are commonly available.  Because butter
  is more perishable when unsalted, I recommend that you keep it frozen
  until you're ready to use it.
  
  "Any herbs or fruits to be used in the butter should be fresh but
  without excess moisture, which will hasten spoilage. If you are
  picking fresh herbs for use in butter, wash them in the garden, 'on
  the hoof', the day before you cut them.
  
  "Choose herbs that complement each other as well as the dish you have
  in mind..."
  
  "I use my food processor for blending herb butters, but you can mix
  them by hand if the ingredients are thoroughly chopped in advance.
  Begin with butter at room temperature, and thoroughly blend in the
  base ingredients - those that are powdery or pasty and others that
  add color and flavor but little texture. Then add the ingredients
  that are to be more apparent in the texture, such as herb leaves or
  olives.
  
  "Freshly made herb butter should be refrigerated for at least three
  hours (overnight is better) to allow the flavors to blend. It can be
  frozen as long as three months without noticeable loss of flavor.
  
                         - Serving Suggestions -
  
  "Sometimes I pack my butters in ordinary plastic containers such as
  commercial margarine tubs or freezer containers, but usually I like
  to do something fancy with them. Here are a few of my favorite ideas."
  
  ~ Pack the butter into small plastic molds and freeze them, then pop
  each out into a plastic bag and keep frozen until served. Melt a
  molded shape of herb butter over fresh pasta.
  
  ~ Roll butter into a fat cylinder, wrap it in plastic wrap, and chill
  it until solid.  Slice off rounds as needed to top vegetables, fish,
  or bread.
  
  ~ Pipe butter florets through a pastry bag fitted with a large star
  tip onto a cookie sheet, then freeze.
  
  ~ Shave off colorful curls of refrigerated herb butter with a butter
  curler.
  
  ~ Make butter balls with a melon baller, then add texture with butter
  paddles.
  
  ~ With a rolling pin, roll the butter out about 1/4 inch thick, then
  cut various shapes with miniature cookie cutters. Freeze until ready
  to use.
  
  ~ Whip the butter with a hand-held mixer until it is light and
  fluffy, then pack it in earthenware crocks. (You need a whisk
  attachment to whip butter in a food processor.)
  
  ~ Use herb butter in making pastry crusts; use savory herbs for savory
  dishes and sweeter herbs (such as lavender and lemon verbena) for
  pastries.

           BUBBLE BATH-----
      1 qt Water
      1    Bar castille soap -- grated
      2 oz Glycerine
      3 dr Perfume
           ROSE BUBBLE BATH-----
      1 qt Water
      1    Bar grated castille soap
      3 oz Glycerine
      3 dr Lilac perfume
           LAVENDER BUBBLE BATH-----
      1 qt Water
      1    Bar grated castille soap
      2 oz Coconut oil
      1 oz Glycerine
      3 dr Violet perfume -- or
      2 dr Voilet floral oil
 
  Any good soap can be used to make bubble bath, but castille generally
  is preferred. Before the soap can be made into bubble bath it must be
  converted to a liquid. To do this,grate 1 bar of castille soap itno 1
  qart of water, warm water helps dissolve the soap faster. Allow the
  soap and water to mix well so that you have a liquid soap solution.
  There are two ingredients that can convert liquid soap into bubble
  bath. Tyhese ingredients can be used together or independantly of
  each other. An old-fashion way to amke bubble bath is to add
  glycerine to liquid soap ( soap shaving and water.) Glycerine has the
  ability to make bubbles and increase suds. Coconut oil is often used
  as a substitute for glycerine, which is usually much higher priced.
  Coconut oil is very effective at creating lather. Both glycerine and
  coconut oil are known for their special skin-softeneing properties.

      Title: MAKING GREEK BALSAMIC VINEGAR
 Categories: Digest, August
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 x  Vinegar
      1 x  Greek Oregano
 
  Well, it's simple and unmeasured.  I decide how much vinegar I want to
  steep, and choose a wide-mouthed jar of that size. I fill this jar
  with roughly equal amounts of fresh Greek oregano (a very strong, hot
  variety...beware as some fresh oregano is insipid), mint (for this, I
  like the yerba buena variety ...a coarse, strong spearmint), and
  winter savory (stonger flavored than summer savory). I generally try
  to bruise the leaves a bit.  I pour the vinegar over the herbs, put a
  layer of waxed paper and a couple of layers of plastic wrap over the
  mouth of the bottle (to help retard the inevitable corrosion of the
  metal cap) and then screw on the jar lid.  I place the jar either on
  a sunny windowsill or on the deck for a few weeks, and then strain
  the vinegar through a coffee filter and return it to the original
  vinegar bottle (which usually has a more corrosion-resistant lid).  I
  don't like to leave any herbs in the vinegar, and don't like to add
  any for decoration, either, because they tend to add a funky taste
  that I don't care for if they sit long enough.

      Title: MAKING HERB VINEGARS 1
 Categories: Herbs, Condiments
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------HERB VINEGAR INFORMATION-----------------------
 
  1.  Gently rinse herbs; shake out excess moisture and allow to dry
  naturally, or pat dry carefully. Remove any damaged or discolored
  leaves and woody stems. Twist or wring the herbs to release their
  volatile oils, and fill a clean glass gallon jar 2/3 full of the
  herbs. Add other flavorings as desired (peeled garlic, dried red
  chiles, citrus peel, flower petals, ginger, spices). Ginger and
  garlic should be peeled and gently mashed with the back of a wooden
  spoon; spices should be slightly crushed with a mortar and pestle.
  
  2.  Heat a good quality vinegar until warm to the touch, but do not
  allow it to boil. Pour the vinegar over the herbs, stirring well and
  gently bruising the herbs with the back of a wooden spoon. Cover with
  plastic wrap or a non-metal lid, and store in a cool place for a few
  weeks, stirring occasionally.
  
  3.  Strain into sterilized decorative bottles, using a non-metal
  funnel and best quality paper coffee filters or double layers of
  cheesecloth, taking care not to disturb sediment on the bottom of the
  large jar. Place a fresh, unbruised herb branch (and/or chiles,
  garlic, citrus peel, and such) into each bottle for garnish. Cork or
  cap bottles, and store in a cool, dark place away from direct
  sunlight. Use within 6-8 months.
  
  4.  As in fine wine, sediment naturally occurs in vinegar and will not
  impair flavor. Red wine vinegar and cider vinegar are apt to develop
  sediment, as are herb vinegars augmented with spices. Peeled garlic
  cloves will darken or discolor when left in the bottle. As you use
  the vinegar, remember to remove or submerge decorative herb sprigs
  that are no longer covered.

      Title: MAKING HOREHOUND DROPS
 Categories: Candies, Seasonings
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 c  Fresh horehound leaves
      1 c  Water
      2 c  Sugar
      2 tb Corn syrup or honey
 
  Put the horehound in a small nonreactive sauce pan and add the water.
  Bring to a boil and simmer, covered, or 20 minutes. Allow to cool,
  then remove horehound and squeeze out all the liquid. Add the sugar
  and corn syrup or honey to the pan, stir with a wooden spoon while
  bringing to a boil, then turn heat down to a gentle simmer. If
  bubbles threaten to overflow the pan, reduce heat slightly and stir.
  
  Boil to the hard-crack stage.  If you have a candy thermometer, this
  is in the range of 330 F, but even so you'll need to test often
  toward the end of cooking to get the hardness right. Keep a shallow
  cup of cold water nearby. Stir the liquid occasionally, and watch how
  it falls from the spoon. When it forms a thread, begin testing for
  hardness by allowing a drop of the mixture to fall into the cup of
  cold water. Don't trust your fingers to examine the now-hardened drop
  in the cup; bite it. If it's at all gooey or sticks to your teeth,
  keep cooking. When it's hard enough to crack when you bite it, remove
  the pan from heat immediately.
  
  If the mixture crystallizes, just add a cup of water and an extra
  tablespoon of corn syrup or honey to the pan, scrape all the
  crystalline chunks into it, and begin again.
  
  Lightly butter a candy mold, cookie sheet, or other heatproof baking
  pan, and pour in the hot mixture.  If you're using a flat-bottomed
  pan, score the surface of the candy after it has cooled enough to
  become firm. This will help in breaking it apart, which should be
  done as soon as the candy can be handled.
  
  After individual "drops" are formed, sift granulated sugar or powdered
  sugar over them to keep them from sticking together. Store in a
  moisture-proof container.

  pectins. The order of combining ingredients depends on the type of
  pectin used. Complete directions for a variety of fruits are provided
  with packaged pectin. Jelly or jam made with added pectin requires
  less cooking and generally gives a larger yield. These products have
  more natural fruit flavors, too. In addition, using added pectin
  eliminates the need to test hot jellies and jams for proper gelling.
  Adding 1/2 teaspoon of butter or margarine with the juice and pectin
  will reduce foaming. However, these may cause off-flavor in a
  long-term storage of jellies and jams. Recipes available using
  packaged pectin include:
  
  Jellies--Apple, crab apple, blackberry, boysenberry, dewberry,
  currant, elderberry, grape, mayhaw, mint, peach, plum, black or red
  raspberry, loganberry, rhubarb, and strawberry.
  
  Jams--Apricot, blackberry, boysenberry, dewberry, loganberry, red
  raspberry, youngberry, blueberry, cherry, currant, fig, gooseberry,
  grape, orange marmalade, peach, pear, plum, rhubarb, strawberry, and
  spiced tomato.
  
  Be sure to use Mason canning jars, self-sealing two-piece lids, and a
  5-minute process (corrected for altitude, as necessary) in boiling
  water. For more information about jams and jellies see "Preparing
  butters, jams, jellies, and marmalades".
  
  Purchase fresh fruit pectin each year. Old pectin may result in poor
  gels. Follow the instructions with each package and the process times
  recommended in Table 1. Table 1. Recommended process time for Jellies
  and Jam with Added Pectin in a boiling-water canner.
  
  Style of Pack: Hot.  Jar Size: Half-pints or Pints. Process Time at
  Altitudes of 0 - 1,000 ft: 5 min.
                         1,001 - 6,000 ft: 10 min.

      Title: MAKING JELLY WITHOUT ADDED PECTIN
 Categories: Canning, Jellies
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
 
  Use only firm fruits naturally high in pectin. Selct a mixture of
  about 3/4 ripe and 1/4 underripe fruit. Do not use commercially
  canned or frozen fruit juices. Their pectin content is too low. Wash
  all fruits thoroughly before cooking. Crush soft fruits or berries;
  cut firmer fruits into small pieces. Using the peels and cores adds
  pectin to the juice during cooking. Add water to fruits that require
  it, as listed in the table of ingredients below. Put fruit and water
  in large saucepan and bring to a boil. Then simmer according to the
  times below until fruit is soft, while stirring to prevent scorching.
  One pound of fruit should yield at least 1 cup of clear juice.
  EXTRACTING JUICES AND MAKING JELLY
  
  To Extract Juice:
  
  Fruit: Apples. Cups of Water to be Added per Pound of Fruit: 1.
  Minutes to Simmer Fruit before Extracting Juice: 20 to 25. Sugar to
  be added to each cup of Strained Juice: 3/4 cup. Lemon Juice to be
  added to each cup of Strained Juice: 1-1/2 tsp (opt). Yield from 4
  Cups of Juice: 4 to 5 half-pints.
  
  Fruit: Blackberries. Cups of Water to be Added per Pound of Fruit:
  None or 1/4. Minutes to Simmer Fruit before Extracting Juice: 5 to
  10. Sugar to be added to each cup of Strained Juice: 3/4 to 1 cup.
  Lemon Juice to be added to each cup of Strained Juice: None. Yield
  from 4 Cups of Juice: 7 to 8 half-pints.
  
  Fruit: Crab Apples. Cups of Water to be Added per Pound of Fruit: 1.
  Minutes to Simmer Fruit before Extracting Juice: 20 to 25. Sugar to be
  added to each cup of Strained Juice: 1 cup. Lemon Juice to be added
  to each cup of Strained Juice: None. Yield from 4 Cups of Juice: 4 to
  5 half-pints.
  
  Fruit: Grapes. Cups of Water to be Added per Pound of Fruit: None or
  1/4. Minutes to Simmer Fruit before Extracting Juice: 5 to 10. Sugar
  to be added to each cup of Strained Juice: 3/4 to 1 cup. Lemon Juice
  to be added to each cup of Strained Juice: None. Yield from 4 Cups of
  Juice: 8 to 9 half-pints.
  
  Fruit: Plums. Cups of Water to be Added per Pound of Fruit: 1/2.
  Minutes to Simmer Fruit before Extracting Juice: 15 to 20. Sugar to
  be added to each cup of Strained Juice: 3/4 cup. Lemon Juice to be
  added to each cup of Strained Juice: None. Yield from 4 Cups of
  Juice: 8 to 9 half-pints. When fruit is tender, strain through a
  colander, then strain through a double layer of cheesecloth or a
  jelly bag. Allow juice to drip through, using a stand or colander to
  hold the bag. Pressing or squeezing the bag or cloth will cause
  cloudy jelly.
  
  Using no more than 6 to 8 cups of extracted fruit juice at a time,
  measure fruit juice, sugar, and lemon juice according to the
  ingredients in the table and heat to boiling. Stir until the sugar is
  dissolved. Boil over high heat to the jellying point. To test jelly
  for doneness, use one of the following methods.
  
  Temperature test: Use a jelly or candy thermometer and boil until
  mixture reaches the following temperatures at the altitudes of:
  
                Sea Level: 220 degrees F.
                 1,000 ft: 218 degrees F.
                 2,000 ft: 216 degrees F.
                 3,000 ft: 214 degrees F.
                 4,000 ft: 212 degrees F.
                 5,000 ft: 211 degrees F.
                 6,000 ft: 209 degrees F.
                 7,000 ft: 207 degrees F.
                 8,000 ft: 205 degrees F.
  
  Sheet or spoon test: Dip a cool metal spoon into the boiling jelly
  mixture. Raise the spoon about 12 inches above the pan (out of
  steam). Turn the spoon so the liquid runs off the side. The jelly is
  done when the syrup forms two drops that flow together and sheet or
  hang off the edge of the spoon.
  
  Remove from heat and quickly skim off foam. Fill sterile jars with
  jelly. For more information see "Jars and Lids". Use a measuring cup
  or ladle the jelly through a wide-mouthed funnel, leaving 1/4-inch
  headspace. Adjust lids and process.
  
  Recommended process time for Jelly without Added Pectin in a
  boiling-water canner.
  
  Style of Pack: Hot. Jar Size: Half-pints or Pints. Process Time at
  Altitudes of 0 - 1,000 ft: 5 min.
                         1,001 - 6,000 ft: 10 min.
                           Above 6,000 ft: 15 min.

  From an article by Louise Tennent Smith.
  
  "Making soup is fun, an exercise in kitchen creativity which cannot go
  wrong---you can ALWAYS fix a soup.
  
  "Homemade stock is good, and easy to make, though time consuming. But
  don't give up on soup making if you haven't time to make your own.
  There are good canned. dried and frozen bases that will allow you to
  whip up a good soup in no time at all.
  
  "Seasoning:  The stock itself gives the base seasoning to a soup, as
  do herbs and spices added during the cooking. The addition of wine
  frequently enhances the flavor. Add about one-quarter cup to one
  quart of soup just before serving, and do not boil after adding. Use
  sherry for light soups with a chicken base, red wine with beef based
  soups, white wine with fish soups.  A cup of beer for every three
  cups of soup is good with bean and other hearty vegetable soups.
  
  "Thickening:  Cooked cereals such as rice, noodles and dumplings give
  body to a clear soup; added raw, they will thicken a soup. Other
  thickeners include egg yolks, pureed vegetables and roux of flour and
  butter.
  
  "Color:  Soups using a good quantity of meat, onion skims, tomato
  skins or browned onions usually have excellent color. Other color
  additives include browning sauce, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup,
  wine, tomato sauce and soy sauce.  The latter group should be used
  with great care in delicate soups, as their flavor might be
  overwhelming."

      Title: MAKING THE LOAF
 Categories: Bread, Information, Mc
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  :          Directions only
  
  Making the Loaf
  
  Kneading
  
  Kneading develops the gluten in the flour to form a framework for
  holding the gases given off by the yeast. The KitchenAid mixer not
  only effortlessly tackles kneading but provides the constant rhythm
  necessary for best results. After all the flour has been added,
  continue to knead for approximately 2 minutes until the dough is
  smooth and satiny, not sticky. Shape the dough into a ball and place
  in an oiled bowl. Brush the top of the dough with additional oil to
  prevent a crust from forming while rising. Cover the bowl with a
  towel or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm (70 degrees F to 85
  degrees F) place, free from drafts.
  
  Rising
  
  Let the dough rise until double in size. To test the dough, depress
  two fingers into the center and if the dent stays, it has doubled.
  Punch the dough down by pushing your fist into the center of the
  dough and pulling the edges over to the center. Turn the dough over.
  Letting the dough rise a second time before shaping will yield a
  finer textured loaf.
  
  Shaping
  
  There are many ways to shape a loaf. Specialty breads, such as braids
  or rolls, will generally include directions in the recipes. Two
  simple methods for shaping standard loaves are as follows:
  
  Form the dough into an oval the size of the pan, stretching and
  turning ends of the dough under and pinching into a seam. Place in
  prepared pan, seam side down. Roll the dough into a rectangle
  slightly longer than the size of the pan. Beginning with the shorter
  side, roll dough towards you. Seal long seam as well as ends with
  hands. Fold sealed ends under and place loaf, seam side down, into
  prepared pan.
  
  Baking
  
  Place loaves in the center of the oven, leaving space for the heat to
  surround the pans. To check for doneness, remove one loaf from its
  pan and tap the bottom. If it sounds hollow it is done. Turn loaves
  onto racks immediately after baking to prevent sogginess.
  
  Bread Making Tips
  
  1.Always store flour in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.
  For long-term storage, store flour and yeast in refrigerator or
  freezer. 2.To measure flour, spoon it lightly into a dry measuring
  cup and level with a spatula. 3.Use the Grain Mill to grind whole
  wheat berries and other grains into flour. One cup of grain yields
  approximately 1-1/4 cups of flour, except for rolled oats which
  yields 7/8 cup of flour. 4.Always check liquid temperature with an
  accurate thermometer.
  
  5.Allow bread to rise in a warm, draft-free place. Place bowl of
  dough on rack over pan of warm water. Or, set oven on lowest setting
  for 10 minutes. Turn oven off and place bowl of dough in oven. 6.For
  soft crusts and extra shine, brush finished bread with melted butter
  and cool uncovered. 7.For crispier crusts, brush loaves with a
  mixture of one egg white and one tablespoon of cold water before
  baking. 8.Inverting finished bread onto racks immediately from oven
  prevents a soggy loaf. 9.Some large recipes and soft doughs may climb
  over the collar of the dough hook. This indicates the dough needs
  more flour. The sooner all the flour is added, the less likely the
  dough is to climb the hook. Try starting with all but the last cup of
  flour in the initial mixing process. Then add the remaining flour as
  quickly as possible, never exceeding the total amount given in the
  recipe. 10.Dough made with whole grain flour may not form a ball on
  the dough hook during kneading. However, as long as there is contact
  between the hook and the dough, kneading will be accomplished.
  11.Allow bread to cool completely before slicing. 12.Baked yeast
  breads may be stored in the freezer for up to six months. Wrap
  securely in plastic wrap or aluminum foil. To thaw, let stand at room
  temperature for 3 hours.

      Title: MAKING TOFU
 Categories: Tofu
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
           Text Only
 
  Take some soy beans and soak them in water overnight.
  
  Take these soaked beans and place them in a blender with some fresh
  water. Grind them up.  Take this stuff and pour through several
  layers of cheesecloth.  Return the pulp to the blender, add more
  water and grind some more.  Pour through several layers of
  cheesecloth.
  
  Take the soy "milk" that you have made and boil it.  Turn off the
  heat and add vinegar.  This should curdle it and you can wrap it in
  cheesecloth (clean, not the cloth you used to strain) and weigh it
  down with a pot of water.  At this point you can treat it just like
  cheese except that it should always be kept in water.
  
  You will need to experiment with it to see how long it takes to get
  firm. The longer it is pressed the firmer it gets.  If it isn't
  strained well the tofu will end up crumbly.
  
  Hope this helps,

  In winter, let fresh, unpasteurized cream stand 12 hours, (in summer,
  about 6 hours) in a heat-proof dish. Then put the cream on to heat -
  the lower the heat the better. It must never boil, as this will
  coagulate the albumen and ruin everything.  When small rings or
  undulations form on the surface, the cream is sufficiently scalded.
  Remove at once from heat and store in a cold place at least 12 hours.
  Then skim the thick, clotted cream and serve it very cold as a
  garnish for berries, or spread on scones and top with jam.

  some of the cream. Have not tried soy milk 5) add one drop red and
  one drop yellow food coloring to vinegar to make reasonably authentic
  orange onions (a la Akbar's)

      Title: MALAY BARBECUED GAME HENS WITH SWEET SPICY LI
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      6    Cornish game hens
     10    Kaffir lime leaves, or fresh
           -lime leaves
      6    Candlenuts, soaked in water
           -for 10 minutes, or
           -substitute skinless almonds
      5    Stalks fresh lemon grass,
           -trimmed, sliced
     10 lg Shallots, peeled and halved,
           -or 2 onions
     10    Garlic cloves, peeled,
           -halved
      8    Red jalapeno chiles,
           -stemmed,seeded
      1 ts Turmeric
 13 1/2 oz Coconut milk
      3 tb Sugar
      1 tb Salt
    1/3 c  Vegetable oil
      1    Lime, cut into wedges
 
  Traditionally, chicken is used for this dish, but Chris Yeo,
  chef-owner of the Straits Cafe, and I experimented with Cornish game
  hens and came up with this winning combination.
  
  Cut hens in half, lengthwise. Pierce birds all over with a fork; set
  aside in a large deep bowl.
  
  The rempah: Fold the lime leaves in half, then tear off the central
  vein. Cut the leaves into very fine shreds; set aside.
  
  Combine the candlenuts, lemon grass, shallots, garlic, chiles and
  turmeric in a blender or food processor; process into a smooth paste.
  If needed, add a tablespoon or so of water to facilitate the blending.
  
  Pour the spice paste into a large bowl. Before opening, shake the can
  of coconut milk well. Then stir the coconut milk into the spice paste
  along with the sugar, salt and lime leaf shreds; mix thoroughly.
  (Makes about 3 1/2 cups).
  
  Pour 1 1/2 cups of the rempah over the birds; marinate at least 30
  minutes. Reserve remaining marinade. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.
  
  Remove hens from marinade and scrape off excess marinade.
  
  Place hens skin-side up on a baking sheet and roast for 15 minutes.
  Turn off the heat and let birds remain in oven for 5 minutes longer.
  Remove from the oven.
  
  Meanwhile, set a wok over medium heat. Add the oil and the reserved
  rempah. Gently fry the paste, stirring frequently, until it
  emulsifies with the oil. Continue frying until fragrant and the
  mixture takes on a rich orange color and a porridge-like consistency,
  about 8 minutes.
  
  The rempah is ready when the oil seeps from mixture and has an orange
  hue. (Spoon off and discard excess oil.) Keep sauce warm. Grill birds
  over glowing red coals until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.
  Pour the sauce over the hens and serve with a squeeze of fresh lime.

  Tips--Joyce says that the 1/3 cup vegetable oil is *necessary* to get
  the right result so don't skimp. To make the rempah, add the hardest
  ingredients to the food processor or blender first and then the rest
  in order of softness. A smooth paste is what you should end up with.
  She also mentions that just prior to frying the rempah, you can fry
  up some fresh chili paste to give the dish some zing. I'd us sambal
  oelek for this or the Vietnamese tuong ot toi. No candlenuts? Use
  macadamias instead.

      Title: MALAY-STYLE CHICKEN & SWEET POTATO STEW
 Categories: None
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Cayenne pepper
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 ts Ground cloves
      2    2 1/2-pound chickens, each
           -cut into 8 pieces
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil, approximately
      2 lg Yellow onions, thinly sliced
      3 tb Minced ginger
      2 tb Minced garlic
      5 tb Prepared curry powder
      2 tb Minced fresh red or green
           -chili pepper of your choice
      2 qt Chicken stock (see note)
      4    Sweet potatoes, cut into
           -large chunks
      1 c  Unsweetened coconut milk
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
 
  1. In a small bowl, combine the flour, cayenne, cinnamon and cloves
  and mix well.
  
  2. Dredge the chicken pieces in the spiced flour. In a large, wide
  stockpot, heat the oil over medium-high heat until hot but not
  smoking. Add the chicken pieces in a single layer, being careful not
  to crowd the pan-work in batches if necessary. Cook until well
  browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. As the chicken is browned, remove
  to a platter.
  
  3. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onions, and cook until they just
  begin to color, about 5 minutes. Add the ginger, garlic, curry
  powder, and chili and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute more.
  Add the stock, the browned chicken and the sweet potatoes, return to
  a simmer and cook for about an hour, covered, until a peek inside one
  of the pieces of chicken shows that it is cooked through.
  
  4. Add the coconut milk and continue to cook for 1 minute. Remove
  from the heat, add cilantro and serve.
  
  Tribune test kitchen note: We used only 1 quart of stock and believe
  that the stated amount would make an unacceptably thin stew.

  grouper, or other tender fleshed fish.

      Title: MALFATTI CHEESE & SPINACH DUMPLINGS
 Categories: Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 lb Spinach
           Salt
      2 c  Ricotta
      2    Eggs
  1 1/2 c  Freshly grated parmesan
           Pepper
           Freshly grated nutmeg
           Flour
      6 tb Butter, melted
 
       Wash the spinach and remove the stems.  In a large pan with the
  lid on, steam the leaves with a little salt in the water that clings
  to them, turning them over, until they crumple. Strain and squeeze
  every bit of water out with your hands: this is all-important and is
  the secret of success (otherwise the dumplings would fall apart).
  Finely chop the leaves
       Mash the ricotta and stir in the eggs, half the parmesan, salt,
  pepper, nutmeg and spinach.  Work very well, shape into balls the
  size of a walnut and roll in flour.
       Fill a large saucepan halfway with water, bring to the boil and
  very carefully drop in the dumplings. Keep the water barely simmering
  until the rise to the surface - they do so very quickly.
       Lift them out very carefully with a slotted spoon and serve very
  hot with melted butter and the remaining parmesan.

 Categories: Pickles
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     24    Cucumber, medium pickling
           -3-4" long, 1 1/4" thick
      1 oz Horseradish root
      1    Dill, bunch mature plants
           -with seeds
      9    Clove garlic
    1/4 lb Parsley, sour cherry and/or
           -black currant leaves
  3 1/2 tb Salt, non-iodized per 2 qts
           -water
 
  Prepare the cucumbers following the instructions for Brined Cucumbers.
  
  Rinse the dill and divide in half. Scrub and rinse the horseradish and
  slice thinly.  Peel and halve the garlic. Wash the various leaves.
  
  Fold half of the dill into a ring and place in the bottom of the jar.
  Strew half the horseradish and garlic and 1/3 of leaves on top.
  Arrange half of pickles upright, packing them tightly.  Place 1/3 of
  the leaves on top, then pack in the rest of the cucumbers in the same
  manner. Top with layers of the remaining horseradish, dill, garlic,
  and leaves.
  
  Combine the salt and water, stirring until the salt dissolves (the
  percenteage of salt in this brine is 2.8-3.0 percent). Pour the brine
  into the jar.  The contents should be fully covered. Place the saucer
  inside the jar with a weight (small rock?). Cover the mouth of the
  jar with 2 layers of cheesecloth and secure with string.
  
  Leave for 3-4 days in cool, airy room whose temperature is about 64-68
  degrees.
  
  Remove the scum as it appears and wash the mouth of the jar daily.
  After 3-4 days, when most active fermentation has subsided a little,
  remove weight and lid. cover jar with its own lid and refrigerate. In
  1 2 days the malossol cucumbers will be ready to eat. Because there
  is less salt in the brine than Brined Cucumbers, malossol cucumbers
  should be eaten sooner.
  
  Store the pickles on the lowest shelf of the refrigerator for 4-5
  days, after which they will become either too salty (and turn into
  regular brined cucumbers) or, more likely, too soft and almost mushy.

      Yield: 45 Servings
 
      1 c  All-purpose flour
  1 1/2 c  Instant malted milk
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Vegetable shortening
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
    1/4 c  Water
 
  "The malt in these dessert crackers will remind you of the
  old-fashioned soda shop. Served alone or with a hot cup of coffee,
  they are a delightful alternative to cookies. 325~F. 10 to 12 minutes
  Preheat the oven to 325~F.
  
  Mix the flours, malted milk, and salt together in a large bowl or in
  the food processor. Add the vanilla extract and mix well. Cut in the
  shortening until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Slowly blend in
  enough of the water to form a dough that will hold together in a
  cohesive ball. The dough should be soft, but not sticky. For easier
  rolling, wrap the dough in wax paper and chill 1/2 hour.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a well-floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll out to between 1/16 and 1/8 inch thick.
  With a sharp knife or cookie cutter, cut the dough into 2-inch

  and spread with orange marmalade or apple butter.

 Categories: Cookies, Maltese, Holiday
      Yield: 60 Slices
 
  1 1/8 c  Almonds, slivered;blanched
           -10 oz
  3 1/2 c  Flour; sifted
  1 1/2 c  Sugar; up to 1 13/4 cups
      1 ts Cinnamon
      2 ts Orange extract
      2 ea Lemon; grated rind of
      2 ea Oranges; grated rind of -OR-
      2 ea -Tangerines
  1 1/2 c  -Water; approximately

MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
           Honey
           Almonds; toasted ,slivered
 
  Toast the almonds on baking sheet for about 5 minutes at 400F. Reset
  the oven for 350F. Grind one-third of the almonds. Mix the ground
  almonds with the flour, sugar, and cinnamon. Add the orange extract
  and the rinds. Mix well. Blend in the slivered almonds. Gradually,
  add enough water to make a stiff dough (the dough will be sticky).
  Form the dough into cake about 7 inches long, 2 inches wide and 1
  inch thick. Bake for 35 minutes. Optional: While they are still hot,
  brush the Kwaresimal with honey, and sprinkle with slivered toasted
  almonds. Let the cakes cool for about 20 minutes, then with a
  serrated knife cut them into slices about 3/8 inch thick. Variations:
  Here are a few of the classic variations: Hazelnuts can be
  substituted for the almonds. You can if you prefer all of the nuts,
  or fewer of them. You can also insert some whole blanched almonds.
  Remember the more nuts you grind to a powder, the more liquid you
  will need to make the dough; and the fewer nuts you grind, the less
  liquid. In Malta these cakes would often be made with orange-flower
  water, which is hard to obtain here. Orange extract or liqueur (or
  other liqueur or rum) can be used as a part of the liquid.

      Title: MALTESE SAUCE  (MALTESER SOSSE)
 Categories: Sauces, German, Meats, Fish, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2    Blood orange or reg. ogange
      1    Green onion, finely chopped
      1 tb Dry white wine
      1 tb White wine vinegar
      3 tb Chicken stock
      2    Egg yolks, slightly beaten
    1/2 c  Butter, cut in small pieces
      1 ts Lemon juice
           Salt
           White pepper
      5 tb Fresh whipped cream *
 
  * 3 to 5 tablespoons of REAL whipped cream...NO substitutes.
  
  This sauce needs to be made with extra care. Cut peel from half the
  orange, removing only the colored portion. Cut peel into fine narrow
  strips. Blanch peel briefly in boiling water, if desired. Finely chop
  peel, if desired; set aside. Juice orange; set aside. In a small
  skillet, simmer green onion 5 minutes over low heat in wine, vinegar
  and stock. Strain well, discarding green onion; cool slightly. Place
  egg yolks and wine mixture in a small enamel-lined saucepan. Place
  over hot water or use a double-boiler. Water should be barely
  simmering at any time. If mixture is over heated it will curdle and
  must be remade from new ingredients. Add butter, one piece at a time,
  mixing well and making sure each piece is fully incorporated before
  adding the next. If desired use a whisk to beat butter into yolk
  mixture. When all butter has been added, sauce should be fairly thick
  and creamy. Add lemon juice, salt, white pepper, balnched orange peel
  and juice. Fold in whipped cream before serving. Serve immediately to
  prevent sauce from seperating. This sauce is delicious with delicate
  fish or vegetable dishes, such as asparagus. It is also very good
  with broiled meat. Makes 4 servings.

      1    Stewing chicken, cut into
           -pieces
      2    Whole carrots, finely diced
    1/2 c  Chopped parsley (preferably
           -Italian parsley)
      3 c  To 4 c cooked pastina or
           -rice
 
  FROM:      Shelley Rodgers (Jolly Rodgers:the Portuguese Pirate!
  (1:161/202))
  
  This recipe came from an unknown magazine.  Judging from the comments
  that accompanied the recipe, apparently the magazine was running a
  Chicken Recipe contest.
  
  Mama Bina's Italian Chicken Soup No Chicken Recipe Contest worth its
  bouillon would be complete without a recipe for chicken soup. This
  recipe was submitted by Renata Pagliaro and Maureen Vieck of
  Cuperino, CA. Renata writes: "I can remember as a child my mother
  would prepare chicken soup at least once a week for dinner. Typical
  of children, I thought that soup was boring (hardly to be compared to
  a hot dog!) and I also thought it was some strange dish that only
  Italians ate.
  
  "Now that I am older and ore sophisticated (enough to even like
  spinach!), I have come to appreciate my mother's chicken soup. It is
  delicate and so simple taht it is actually elegant. To top all of
  that, it is easy to make, nutritious and low in calories."
  
  salt to taste
  
  Wash the chicken pieces and remove as much skin as possible. Put the
  chicken into a large dutch oven, fill with water and cook over high
  heat. When the water boils, skim off the foam that comes to the
  surface and discard.
  
  When no more foam appears, put the carrots and parsley into the pot
  with the chicken. Lower the heat to a simmer so taht the water
  doesn't boil down. Do not cover. Add salt to taste and check every so
  often for flavor.
  
  Allow to cook for 1-1/2 hours.  You may prepare rice or pastina in the
  meantime and set it aside.  After soup has cooked, remove the chicken
  from the pot with a slotted spoon. Take the chicken off the bones and
  tear into bite-sized pieces and place back into the broth.
  
  Put the cooked and strained pastina or rice into the soup and allow
  to heat through.  Just before serving, you may add a little butter
  for flavor.
  
  Serve hot with a crusty French bread and a bottle of white wine. This

           -and 5 lb ground lamb)
      2 qt Chicken necks and backs,
           -boiled down in own broth
      9 lb Onion, unpeeled
      2 qt Beef stock
  4 1/2 qt Bell peppers, blended
      3 ga Progresso tomato paste
      2 ts Salt
      3 lb Mushrooms
  2 2/3 c  Sugar
      1 tb Oregano
           Gunk, to taste
           -(see recipe)
 
  Fill two 5-gallon pots with equal portions of ground beef (or beef and
  lamb) and scramble over high heat until well-done.
  
  Blend onions and add to meat, along with beef juice. Blend bell
  peppers and add to meat.  Add tomato paste and cut heat from high
  (boiling) to simmer. Add salt, mushrooms, blended chicken meat,
  sugar, "gunk" and oregano. This should be let to simmer for half a
  day to a full day. When finished, can freeze basic sauce in jars or
  ziploc bags.
  
  TO SERVE SAUCE:  Thaw 1 1/2 quart container of sauce (four servings).
  Peel and sliver 4 garlic cloves into blender; add 1 cup wine (use
  sherry or burgundy) and 1 T brown sugar, blend. Add to sauce and heat
  until ready.
  
  Beau's notes:
  
  *  This sauce is patterned after that of a Syro-American restaurateur
  of Ocala whose restaurant, The Blue Bird, no longer exists. However,
  the spaghetti sauce recipe, one Mama (after trying at first more or
  less to duplicate the Blue Bird's) refined, is immortal. Because of
  the vegetables used in it, the family tradition has been to make a
  meal of spaghetti with the sauce alone. The basic sauce is useful
  also for lasagna and other pasta dishes.
  
  *  Mom uses juices from beef roasted with sherry and "gunk" for beef
  stock.
  
  *  The family is still  boycotting Hunt's anything!

 Categories: Vietnamese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     12 lg Male blue crabs, cleaned
           -and halved, with top
           -shells reserved
      2 c  All-purpose flour, seasoned

      4 tb Minced garlic
      3 tb Hot pepper flakes
      3 tb Kosher salt
      3 tb Sugar
      3    Piece fresh ginger peeled
           -and julienned
      1 bn Green onions, chopped
      4    Or 5 fresh serrano chiles,
           -thinly sliced into rounds
 
  We're seeing more and more of the live Eastern blue crabs out here on
  the West coast.  So far mainly in Asian markets++I have yet to run
  across any at Safeway. While the Asians are busy furnishing good,
  fresh things to eat at very reasonable prices, Safeway and it's ilk
  are so busy trying to satisfy our banking needs that they don't seem
  to pay much attention to food anymore.
  
  This can be prepared using either the blue guys or the big ol'
  Dungeness crabs.  This reminds me of the first Vietnamese dish I ever
  tried, "Roast Crab" at Thanh Long on Judah street in San Francisco
  years ago. That dish alone won my ever-lasting respect for Vietnamese
  cuisine. It too used butter, though I'm relatively sure it also used
  Chinese fermented black beans for their savory kick and the crab
  wasn't flour coated before frying.
  
  Dredge the crabs in the seasoned flour.  In a large skillet heat oil
  to a depth of 1/2 inch.  Add the top shells and fry over fairly high
  heat, turning, until crispy on both sides. Remove to paper towels to
  drain. Discard the cooking oil.  Return the pan to medium heat and
  add the butter and olive oil. when the butter melts, add the
  lemongrass, garlic and pepper flakes and saute for about 30 seconds.
  Add the crab halves and sprinkle with the salt and sugar.  Stir well.
  Add the ginger, green onions and serrano chiles. Cook, stirring often
  for 3 to 4 minutes. Place the crab tops, hollow side up, on a
  platter.  Tuck the crab pieces in the shells. Pour all of the pan
  juices over the stuffed shells. Serve at once, with steamed jasmine
  rice and plenty of napkins for messy hands.
  
  Serves 4.

      Title: MAMA LEAH'S ROAST DUCK WITH ORANGE SAUCE
 Categories: Jewish, Poultry
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
  3 1/2 lb To 4-1/2 lb duck
      1    Orange, peeled
           Salt
           Garlic powder
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 c  Orange juice
      1 tb Orange rind, grated
      1    Lemon's juice
      2 tb Orange liqueur (optional)
      2    Oranges, sliced into rounds
           Parsley, for garnish
 
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
  
  Wash the duck, dry it, and make sure to remove any remaining
  pinfeathers. Pull away and discard any loose pieces of fat.  Place
  the peeled orange inside the cavity. Sprinkle the outside of the duck
  lightly with salt and garlic powder. Rub the salt and garlic into the
  skin but do not prick the skin.
  
  Line the bottom of roasting pan with aluminum foil to catch to grease
  as it melts.  Place the duck on a rack in the roasting pan.
  
  Cook in the preheated oven for 1 hour.
  
  In the meantime, in a bowl, mix together the brown sugar and
  cornstarch. In a saucepan, place the mixture together with the orange
  juice, orange rind, lemon juice, and the orange liqueur, if desired.
  Stir well and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce to a simmer,
  stirring constantly until the mixture loses its cloudiness and
  thickens slightly.
  
  Remove the duck from the oven and allow it to cool for 10 to 15
  minutes. (Do not turn off the oven.) Split the duck in half using
  poultry shears or a sharp knife. Remove the breastbone. Once you
  split the duck, you will find it easy to gently pry the breastbone
  away from the meat. Drain off any accumulated fat from the roasting
  pan. Place the duck halves on the rack, skin side up. Brush the duck
  with the orange sauce and reserve the remaining sauce to serve at the
  table.
  
  Roast the duck for another 30 to 40 minutes.  When done, the skin
  should be very crisp and browned.  Serve the duck surrounded by the
  orange rounds and garnished with parsley.  Pour the warm orange sauce
  into a gravy bowl and pass around. This duck goes very nicely with
  any rice dish. Makes 2 to 3 servings.
  
  ADVICE FROM MAMA:  For a very fancy variation, in a small saucepan,
  heat 1/3 cup of orange liqueur. Place the roasted duck halves on a
  preheated serving platter, decorate, and pour the heated liqueur over
  the duck. Strike a match and light the liqueur in the bottom of the
  platter. Carry the duck flambe to the dinning table to a chorus of
  ooohs and aaahs.
    For an exotic variation, try mixing together 1/3 cup of honey, 1/3
  cup of orange juice, and 1 teaspoon of curry powder. Season the duck
  to taste as usual.  Apply half of the sweet, spicy mixture to the
  bird. Roast in the preheated oven as above.  Periodically baste the
  duck with remaining mixture. This delicious coating on the duck will
  have you dreaming of warm nights in Kashmir.

   I finally found it and we are hooked. Thanks to my bread maker; we
  have no excuse for not having a great homemade pizza in no time. I
  hope you'll try it out and let me know how you like it. By the way,
  this doesn't make a Pizza Hut type of pan pizza dough, instead it is
  a hand-tossed type that is tender and not tough...delicious! Try it.
  Another note: I have a Welbilt 350.
  
  Put all ingredients in your bread maker on manual and let it do the
  work. I let it rise for a little longer after it finishes, but judge
  for yourself if it requires that. Divide into two 12" pies (I roll it
  out) Put on two cornmeal covered pans, prick with a fork, brush with
  oil, add toppings and preheat your oven to 500F. Let the pizzas rise
  for 15 minutes or so, then bake for 7 minutes. MMMama Mia!! I've
  gotten great recipes off this BB, so I thought I'd reciprocate! Hope
  you like it!!

      Title: MAMA STAMBERG'S CRANBERRY RELISH
 Categories: Condiments, Holiday
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 c  Cranberries, raw
      1 sm Onion
    1/2 c  Sugar
    3/4 c  Sour cream
      2 tb White horseradish
           -(prepared)
 
  Grind the onion and cranberries together.  Add all the other
  ingredients and mix well. Put in a plastic container and freeze. One
  hour before serving, move to the refrigerator to soften.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Frozen cranberry relish with horseradish -- Susan Stamberg, former
  co-host of National Public Radio's "All Things Considered," used to
  broadcast this recipe every year around Thanksgiving. She claimed it
  was her mother's, but it turned out that her mother got it from a
  Craig Claiborne column many years before. Very few people are neutral
  about this unusual, rather strong relish, they either love it or hate
  it. I'm in the former group.
  
  *  This relish is shocking pink in color, so plan your table setting
  accordingly.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, overnight freezing.
  : Precision:  measure the horseradish.

      Title: MAMA'S COOKIE-COVERED NUTS
 Categories: Cookies, Mom
      Yield: 3 Dozen
 
      2 c  Flour
  1 1/2 c  Confectioner's sugar
    1/4 ts Baking powder
    1/2 c  Butter, unsalted
      2 ts Vanilla extract
      1 pn Salt
           Mixed nuts
 
  Mix the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.  Cut in the butter. Add
  the vanilla extract and a tiny amount of water SLOWLY to form a
  heavy, thick dough.  (The amount of water varies by the amount of
  humidity in the air; never a given in Florida!)
  
  Shape dough into balls, and wrap around various types of nuts. Bake
  at 275 degrees for 30 minutes.  (If you add too much water, the
  cookie will flatten out with an obvious, single nut in the middle.
  But they still taste good!)
  
  Vicki's notes:
  
  *  When my brother and I were young, Daddy made "surprise" biscuits
  for a special breakfast.  They were just refrigerated dough, but he
  would always sneak something into the middle, such as jam, peanut
  butter, you never knew!  We adored the surprises, and I guess this
  was my mother's way of doing the same thing...

      Title: MAMMA MARY'S PASTA E FAGIOLI
 Categories: Soups, Pasta, Italian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Garlic cloves; minced
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 cn Tomato sauce (8 oz)
      1 c  Water
      1 cn Cannellini beans (16 oz)
    1/2 lb Ditalini or elbow macaroni
           Fresh parsley; chopped
           Cheese; grated
 
   In a saucepan, fry the garlic gently in the oil until golden brown.
  Add the tomato sauce and water, and let cook for 10 minutes. Add
  beans, stir gently, continue to cook on simmer. Cook ditalini or
  elbow macaroni al dente, drain and add to bean mixture.  Stir gently.
  If it gets too thick, add a little more water.  Add parsley. Serve
  immediately, or else the pasta will absorb all the liquid. This is so
  good that I would double the recipe, because it is delicious when
  sprinkled with grated cheese, with Italian bread dipped in the sauce.
  Some people love it cold the next day, or you can add a little water
  and warm it up. Enjoy! Serves 4.
  
  VARIATIONS:  Omit the can of tomato sauce and it becomes a "white
  sauce" utilizing the white bean juice. Pasta e Fagioli is great with
  a sprinkle of crushed, dried hot pepper flakes.  ALTERNATIVE: Replace
  cannellini beans with a can of chick peas, sweet peas, black eye peas
  or lima beans - whatever matches your wallpaper best!

  MAKE THE CREPE BATTER:  Mix together egg whites, flour and water,
  then beat with a wire whisk to get rid of lumps.
  
  COOK THE CREPES:  Lightly coat a crepe pan with olive oil and heat to
  medium. Ladle 2 1/2 T crepe batter into heated pan. The crepe batter
  should lightly cover the bottom of the pan in a thin layer. Tilt pan
  to cover evenly. When edges of crepe turn lacy and brown and crepe is
  cooked through,remove crepe and stack on a plate. Continue until all
  the batter is used.

  ricotta cheese mixture and 1 T spinach mixture on each crepe. Fold or
  roll each crepe to seal in mixture.

  rectangular casserole dish.  When the pan is full, spoon marinara
  sauce over crepes. Bake at 325 degrees F. for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve
  with grated Parmesan cheese.
  
  If you don't have a crepe pan, you can use a small (6-inch) frying

 Categories: Mexican, Loo
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    Small turkey, in serving
           Pieces, or 2 chickens
    1/2 c  Lard
      2    Ancho chiles, chopped

      5 ts Cider vinegar
      1 ts Salt or to taste
      4 oz Pineapple, chunked
      2    Firm cooking apples,
           Peeled, cored, & sliced
      1 lg Unripe banana, peeled
           And sliced
 
  This looks very much like Mancha manteles, which Richard [Manchurian
  Candidate] Condon describes in The Mexican Stove:
  
    Two little women staggered in from another room carrying a gigantic
    bowl of something which was jetting hot perfume. The sen~ora hoped
    I enjoyed mancha manteles. Reyes explained that this was the second
    Mexican meal of my life, ... but that he knew that I would -love-
    mancha manteles. The sen~ora beamed and instructed me to eat heart-
    ily, remembering that the translation of mancha manteles was: ta-
    blecloth stainer. I was sweating hard as she overdid me the honor
    of preparing my plate, a very wide plate, perhaps a foot in diam-
    eter. The tablecloth stainer contains the following: one turkey,
    four chorizo sausages, sliced pineapples, sliced apples, sliced
    bananas, some pork; ancho, pasilla and serrano chiles; almonds,
    cinnamon, lard, and tomato puree. Reyes scooped away as though
    he had picked up a fake stomach at Macy's. I got through it. ...
    A very peculiar physiological metamorphosis happened to Reyes
    that afternoon. When he entered the chairman's house he was a
    well-set-up, definitely not stout fellow who spoke American with
    a marked California accent. After that dinner he was not only a
    stout man - and I mean a shorter, rounder, fatter man with a
    pronounced paunch - but his speech changed. He would ramble in
    the diction of a jazz musician or break into voluble Spanish.
    Not that the sen~ora's meal taught him to speak Spanish. He had
    always spoken Spanish. But never to Jewish delicatessen waiters,
    for example, or to austere British bootmakers.
  
  Brown turkey in lard. Remove. Pour off fat, leaving 2 T in the pan.
  Fry chiles, almonds, and sesame seeds together until fragrant. Blend
  to a puree in a blender. Fry chorizo meat in the fat that remains in
  the pan. Remove. In the same fat, cook onions until soft. Add blended
  mixture, tomatoes, and cinnamon. Cook a few minutes and then turn out
  the whole mess into a large casserole. Mix in the stock, sugar,
  vinegar, and salt. Taste for seasoning. Add browned turkey pieces,
  chorizo meat, and fruit. Cover and simmer 45 min to 1 hr. After
  Richard Condon's recipe and description.

      Title: MANDARIN PANCAKES
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
      2 c  All purpose flour, unsifted
    3/4 c  Boiling water
      2 tb Sesame oil (more or less)
 
   Measure flour into a bowl and mix in water with a fork or
  chopsticks. Work dough several minutes until it holds together, then
  knead on a lightly floured board until smooth and satiny (about ten
  minutes). Cover and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Roll
  dough into a 12 inch long log.  Cut into 12 equal pieces and keep
  covered.
   To make each pancake, cut one piece of dough exactly in half. Roll
  each half into a ball and flatten slightly. Roll each ball on a very
  lightly floured board to a round 3 inches in diameter. Brush sesame
  oil lightly on top of one round and cover with another round. Press
  the 2 rounds lightly but firmly together. Place the double round on a
  lightly floured board and roll out, from center to edges, until 7 or
  8 inches in diameter (don't worry if rounds are not perfect). Turn
  frequently, brushing board lightly with flour as needed.  Repeat
  procedure until you have 2 or 3 pancakes; then cook before making
  more.
   Heat a wide frying pan over medium-high heat, then place a pancake
  on the ungreased surface.  Turn about every 15 seconds until cake is
  blistered by air pockets, turns parchment color and feels dry. Cake
  should not brown, but a few golden spots won't hurt. If overcooked,
  cake becomes brittle. Remove from pan and carefully pull the two
  halves apart and stack them on a plate.  Keep covered as you cook
  remaining cakes. Serve warm; or let cool, wrap airtight, and
  refrigerate of freeze for later use.
   To heat for serving, thaw if frozen.  Line a flat-bottomed steamer
  with towel dipped in water and wrung dry; stack pancakes inside and
  fold towel over pancakes. Cover and steam over simmering water for
  five minutes. Fold hot pancakes in half, then in half again, and
  arrange in a serving basket. Since they dry out quickly, serve just a
  few at a time and keep remainder covered.

      Title: MANDARIN PANCAKES (DOILIES)
 Categories: Chinese, Pancakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  All purpose flour
      1 c  Boiling water
           Sesame oil
 
  Place flour in a mixing bowl.  Gradually stir in boiling water,
  mixing with a wooden spoon.  When it is cool enough to handle, knead
  with your hands until it is smooth and elastic, adding a little more
  flour if necessary. Cover dough with a damp dish towel and let it
  rest for 30 minutes. Roll dough out on a lightly floured surface to a
  1/4 " thickness. Use a 3 inch round cookie cutter to cut the dough,
  rerolling it until all of the dough has been used.  Smear sesame oil
  over one side of each 3 inch circle of dough.  Put two circles
  together with the sesame-oiled sides touching. Now roll out the dough
  circles until they are about 6 inches in diameter, turning as you
  roll so they keep a round shape. Cover the pancakes with a damp towel
  until you are ready to cook them. Use an ungreased heavy skillet over
  low heat and roast one side of the pancake until it bubbles slightly
  (about 1 minute). Do not brown. Turn over and roast the other side.
  Remove from the skillet and when cool enough to handle pull the two
  pancakes apart.  Wrap the pancakes in foil and refrigerate. To
  Reheat: Fold each pancake into quarters and place in a steamer. Steam
  for 5 minutes. Note: Another method is to place folded pancakes on
  top of rice that has just been cooked. The heat and steam from the
  rice will reheat them. From: The Chinese Menu Cookbook Shared By: Pat

  NOTES:
  
  *  Bamboo shoot, pork and mushroom soup -- I worked out this recipe
  in an attempt to duplicate the Mandarin Soup served at the Peking
  Royal Kitchen in Pittsburgh. My friends all agree that it is a good
  replica; some prefer my version to the "real thing." Yield: Serves
  4-6.
  
  *  The quality of the chicken stock makes a huge difference in a
  recipe like this. Use fresh stock if you can, or buy the best grade
  of canned chicken stock you can find.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes waiting and 20 minutes preparing.
  : Precision:  Measure spices and seasonings.

      Title: MANDARINE RICE
 Categories: Rice
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
    200 ml Raw rice
    550 ml Water
      1    Carrot
      2 tb Olive oill
      2    Mandarines, zest and juice
     40 g  Slivered almonds
    100 g  Sugar
    1/2 ts Saffron threads
      1 tb Sultanas
 
  This celebratory rice dish is a little fiddly to make the first time,
  so save it for a weekend when you feel like cooking. Its sweetness
  marries very well with savoury foods, from the Middle Eastern braised
  lamb dishes for which it was devised to Indian curries and South-East
  Asian coconut curries.
  
  Wash 200 mL rice in several changes of water until the water runs
  clear. Then soak the rice in 550 mL water for about an hour. Drain in
  a sieve.
  
  Cut 1 carrot into fine diagonal slices, then julienne the slices. In a
  large pot which can go from stove top to oven, heat 2 tablespoons of
  olive oil and cook the carrots, stirring, until they are golden, then
  remove from the oil (reserving the oil in the pot) and drain.
  
  In a saucepan, make a syrup. Zest 2 mandarines then juice them and
  make the juice up to 150 mL with water. Add both zest and liquid to
  the saucepan, together with 40 g slivered almonds, 100g sugar and
  half a teaspoon of saffron threads. Bring to the boil and cook gently
  for about half an hour, stirring often, then add carrots and a
  tablespoon of sultanas and cook, stirring, for a few minutes more.
  The syrup should be quite thick but not burnt. Remove from the heat.
  
  In the carrot pot, reheat the oil and stir in the drained rice until
  it is transparent. Add 230 mL boiling water and stir gently over a
  low heat till the water has almost gone. Cover the rice with the
  syrup, put on the lid and bake in a 160-170 degree C oven for half an
  hour. Uncover, stir to mix and serve.

      Title: MANGO & TAMARIND CHUTNEY
 Categories: Canning, Condiments, Fruits, Harned 1994, Relishes
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
    1/2 c  Dried tamarind pulp; packed
           -or-
    1/2 c  Fresh lime juice; strained
           + 1/2 cup water
  2 1/2 c  ;Water
      3 lb Mangoes*
      1 c  Onions; in 1/4" dice
      1 c  Golden raisins
      1 c  Dried currants
      4 tb Fresh ginger; minced
           -- or more to taste
      3 lg Garlic cloves; minced fine
      1    Lemon; grated zest of
      2 c  Light brown sugar; packed
    3/4 c  Sugar
      2 tb Mustard seed
      1 tb Salt
      2 ts Dried red pepper; crushed*
      2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts Turmeric
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
           -- or more to taste
  1 1/2 c  Distilled white vinegar
 
  *Mangoes can be unripe, half-ripe or part unripe and part ripe. Using
  part or all almost-ripe fruit will yield a chutney with a softer
  texture. If you like jammy chutney, cut the fruit into small bits;
  for a chunky product, use 1/2" or larger cubes and stop cooking the
  mixture as soon as the fruit pieces are translucent.
  
  **In place of the crushed dried red pepper, can substitute 2 dried hot
  peppers (each 2 1/2 to 3" long) which have been seeded and crumbled,
  or 1 tb. finely minced red or green fresh hot peppers. Increase any
  of these if you are sure you want a hotter chutney.
  
  Crumble tamarind into a small bowl and stir in 1 1/2 cups of the
  water; let tamarind soak for at least an hour, meanwhile preparing
  the remaining ingredients. Or substitute the fresh lime juice plus
  1/2 cup of water at this point.
  
  Peel and dice the mangoes, cutting them into small pieces for a
  jamlike chutney, into 1/2" or larger dice for a chunky mixture. Place
  the pieces in a preserving pan. Add the onions, raisins, currants,
  ginger, garlic, lemon zest, brown and granulated sugars, mustard
  seed, salt, crushed hot red pepper, cinnamon, turmeric, cloves,
  ground red pepper, white vinegar and the remaining 1 cup water; stir
  the mixture and let it rest until the tamarind "juice" is ready, or
  for up to several hours, if that is convenient.
  
  When the tamarind pulp is very soft, strain the liquid through a
  sieve, pressing it to remove all possible liquid and any pulp that
  will pass through.  Discard the pulp remaining in the sieve. Add the
  liquid to the chutney mixture.
  
  Set the pan over medium heat and bring the ingredients to a boil.
  Lower the heat so the mixture simmers and cook it, uncovered,
  stirring often, until the mango and onion pieces are translucent and
  the chutney has thickened to the consistency of preserves, 1 to 2
  hours depending on the firmness of the fruit.  (The chutney will
  thicken further in the jar, so don't reduce it too much.)  If the
  chutney threatens to stick before the mango pieces are translucent,
  add a little water.
  
  Remove chutney from the heat, cool a sample, and taste it for
  tartness, sweetness, and degree of hotness. (The overall flavor is
  elusive at this point, but these factors can be judged.) If you wish,
  add a little more vinegar, sugar or ground hot red pepper.
  
  Reheat the chutney to boiling and ladle it into hot, clean pint or
  half-pint canning jars, leaving 1/4" of headspace. Seal the jars;
  process for 15 minutes (for either size jar) in a boiling-water bath.
  Cool, label, and store the jars for a least a month so that its many
  flavors can blend and balance.  This will keep for at least a year in
  a cool pantry.
  
  Yield: 6 to 7 cups.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Mango pulp (see note)
      6 c  Milk, whole
      3 tb Sugar
     12    Ice cubes
 
  Put into a blender about half (to one third) of the mango pulp, about
  3 cups milk, about 1 1/2 T sugar and 6 ice cubes into the blender.
  Blend until smooth. Serve. Repeat quickly, as people will already be
  asking for more.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A refreshing Indian summer drink -- This is a delicious,
  refreshing and easy-to-make drink for hot summer days. Yield: 6 12-oz
  drinks.
  
  *  Canned mango pulp is available in Indian and Latin American grocery
  stores. The "mango nectar" that is widely available in American
  grocery stores does not have nearly enough mangoes per unit volume to
  make this drink.  If you are lucky enough to be able to get fresh
  mangoes, you can use the flesh of one ripe mango for about 1 cup of
  the mango pulp; if you do that, increase the amount of sugar to about
  2 tablespoon per batch, as canned mango pulp always has added sugar.
  
  *  You can make interesting variations on this recipe by using plain
  yogurt for some or all of the milk, and by adding a tart
  counterbalance to the mangoes, such as shredded kiwi fruit.

  Beat egg whites at low speed until frothy. Gradually increase speed
  to high and continue beating soft peaks start to form. One ts at a
  time, gradually add remaining 2 tb of sugar and continue beating
  whites until they form stiff, shiny peaks. Scrape 1/3 of whites on
  top of beaten egg yolks. Resift 1/3 of flour mixture over whites &
  fold flour mixture and egg whites into egg yolk mixture, making sure
  to free any flour that may be clinging to side of the bowl. One-third
  at a time, gently fold in remaining whites with 1/3 of resifted flour
  mixture. Do not overfold. Scrape batter into prepared pan. Bake cake
  for 8 to 12 minutes, until center springs back when gently touched.
  Cool cake in pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Remove from pan & cool
  completely.
  
  Make the mango mousse: Put water in a small heatproof cup. Sprinkle
  gelatin over water and let stand for 5 minutes to soften. Place cup
  with softened gelatin in a saucepan with enough water to come halfway
  up side of cup. Heat gelatin mixture in hot, not simmering water.
  Stir gelatin mixture frequently for 2 to 3 minutes, until gelatin
  granules dissolve completely and mixture is clear. Remove pan from
  heat. Leave cup containing gelatin mixture in hot water to keep
  gelatin warm until ready to use.
  
  Peel mangos and cut fruit away from pit. Cut fruit into large chunks.
  Combine half of mango chunks with 1/2 cup of sugar in bowl of a food
  processor. Process mangos for 40 to 60 seconds, until pureed. Transfer
  pureed mangos to a large saucepan. Repeat with remaining mangos and
  1/2 cup of sugar. Cook the mango mixture over medium-low heat,
  stirring constantly until warm. Remove saucepan from the heat. Add
  the gelatin mixture and vanilla and whisk until blended. Transfer
  mango mixture to a large bowl and cool to room temperature. In a
  chilled large bowl, beat the heavy cream and sour cream until mixture
  forms soft peaks. Fold 1/3 of whipped cream into mango mixture to
  lighten it. Fold in remaining whipped cream.
  
  Assemble cake: Remove side from a 10-by-3-inch springform pan. Trim a
  12-inch cardboard circle so that it fits snugly within curved lip of
  bottom of springform pan. Reattach side of springform pan. Remove
  paper circle from bottom of cake. Spread raspberry jam in an even
  layer over top of cake. Place cake layer in bottom of prepared pan.
  Scrape mango mousse over cake layer and smooth it into an even layer.
  Cover with plastic wrap and freeze for at least
        6    hours or overnight.
  
  Unmold cake: Using a portable blow dryer or damp very hot towel,
  carefully heat outside of springform pan until edge of mousse melts
  slightly. Release clamp on side of springform pan and gently lift it
  up and remove it from around side of the cake. Defrost cake in
  refrigerator for at least 3 hours, until ready to decorate.
  
  Decorate cake: Spread toasted almonds on a piece of waxed paper. Set
  aside 28 of best almond halves to garnish cake. Lift cake up on
  cardboard cake circle, supporting bottom of cake in one hand. Scoop
  up almonds and gently press them against side of cake, working around
  cake until side is completely covered. Put cake on a serving plate.
  In a chilled small bowl, using a handheld electric mixer set at
  medium speed, beat cream with the sugar until stiff peaks begin to
  form. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a large closed star tip (such as
  Ateco #4) with whipped cream. Pipe 14 rosettes around top edge of
  cake. Garnish each rosette with 2 toasted almond slices. Refrigerate
  cake until ready to serve. by Lisa Morley, chef and owner of A Sweet

      Title: MANGO ROAST PORK LOIN
 Categories: Meat, Mango, Main dishes
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      4 tb Butter
      1 tb Curry powder
      4 c  Fresh pineapple - diced
      1 c  Chicken broth
      1    Pork loin-boneless(3 1/2 lb)
    2/3 c  Mango chutney
           Salt & Pepper (to taste)
           Curry-Pineapple Rice (Opt.)
 
  Mango garnish: 2 fresh mangoes peeled and diced (or sliced) and
  tossed with 1 Tbl. minced fresh ginger and 1 Tbl. minced cilantro.
  Optional: additional mango chutney. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  Place butter and curry powder in skillet.  Cook over medium heat for
  3 minutes, stirring frequently. Add pineapple and stir to coat.  Add
  pineapple juice and broth and bring to a boil on high heat.  Boil 8
  minutes.
       Meanwhile, trim pork of excess fat, leaving a thin layer on top
  of the meat.  Place, fat-side up, in a shallow roasting pan. Using a
  slotted spoon, scoop up pineapple and place around the meat. Pour
  one-third cup of juice-broth mixture over top of meat. Place in the
  middle of a preheated 350-degree oven. Roast for 1 hour, uncovered.
       Meanwhile, reduce juice-broth mixture by boiling on high heat for
  about 8 to 10 minutes.  You want to reduce it by half in volume. As
  the pork roasts, if pan look dry, spoon a little of this reduced
  juice-broth mixture over the roast to baste it.  If preparing rice,
  reserve 1 cup of juice-broth mixture; set aside.
       Remove roast from oven and season with a little salt and pepper.
  Spread chutney over the top of the roast, covering sides and ends.
  Return to oven and roast, uncovered, an additional 30 minutes (roast
  should have an internal temperature of 150 to 160 degrees). Add more
  juice-broth mixture to pan if it looks dry.
       Prepare Curry-Pineapple Rice, if desired.
       Allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing.
       If using, place rice on serving platter.  Arrange pork slices,
  overlapping each slice to form a pattern. Place mango garnish around
  the pork.  Serve immediately. Curry-Pineapple Rice:
       Place 1 cup of the juice-broth mixture and 3 cups of water in a
  large saucepan.  Add a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil. Add 2 cups of
  long grain rice, cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer, covered, for
  18 minutes. If any liquid remains cook a few more minutes. Remove lid
  and fluff with a fork. If desired, stir in some of the pineapple
  wedges that cooked with the pork.

      4    To 6 firm-ripe mangos
      1    Sweet onion (such as a Texas
           .1015), thinly sliced
      4    Fresh jalapenos, seeded and
           .slivered, or to taste

    3/4 c  Cider vinegar
           Salt and freshly ground
           -black pepper to taste
      1 ds Sugar
 
  A most unusual and provocative taste combination of sweet-hot
  ingredients, Mango Salad was a weekly Favorite Recipe contest winner
  in June 1988. To prepare mangos, cut a slice off each end.  Stand
  mango on the larger flat end and cut the peel from top to bottom, in
  a curve, with a sharp knife. Cut flesh away from the flat oval seed,
  using the same technique: slice from top to bottom in a curve on
  either side of seed. Cut remaining mango from the sides, but don't
  cut too close to seed. Slice mango flesh or cut into chunks. Combine
  mango, onion and jalapeno in a medium-size bowl. In another bowl,
  combine oil, vinegar, salt, black pepper and sugar, stirring to make
  dressing. Add dressing to mango mixture and let stand 2 hours or more
  before serving.  Makes about 8 servings. ** Houston Chronicle 4/17/96

  2. In bowl of food processor, combine mangoes, and all other

   Process on and off just until finely diced.  Pour over pasta; serve
  at room temperature. TIP: Use a ripe sweet mango for a more intense
  flavor. If unripe, mangoes are unpleasantly sour.  I have used papaya
  instead of mangoes. Make ahead>>> Prepare salsa early in the day and
  refrigerate. (This will also allow it to develope more flavor.) Pour

  stone in long, vertical sections.  Slice the flesh from the skin.
  Repeat these steps with the remaining mangoes. Cut 12 thin, uniform
  slices for garnish and set them aside.  Press the remaining mango
  slices through a strainer into a bowl.  (You should have 1 1/2 cups

 Categories: Sauces, Salsa
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
      2 tb Peanut Oil
      8 ea Mangos-ripe-peeled-diced
    1/2 c  White Onion-diced
    1/2 c  Carrot-diced
      2 ea Habanero chiles- seeded
    1/2 c  Champagne Vinegar
    1/2 c  Catsup
    1/4 c  Sugar

  METHOD: This Salsa works well using either orange or green habanero.
  Heat the oil in a saucepan and add the diced mangos, onion, carrot,
  and habanero chilies. Cook for about 10 minutes over medium heat,
  until onions are soft and translucent. This has natural sugar in it
  so be careful not to scorch it. Deglaze with vinegar, and add the
  catsup and sugar. Bring to a slow boil, reduce heat, and simmer for
  35 to 45 minutes. This last step is done easily in a double boiler so
  as not to scorch this sauce. Remove from heat and season with salt to
  taste. Transfer to a blender, pulse sauce, and strain through a
  medium strainer. If the sauce is to thick, add a little water to
  thin. If blended carefully this may not need strained.

      Title: MANGOES WITH STICKY RICE
 Categories: Thai, Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Coconut cream
      4 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      4    Ripe mangoes
      3 c  Sticky coconut rice
 
  Mix the coconut cream with the sugar and salt, and bring to a boil.
  Simmer for a few minutes, stirring occasionally.
  
  Peel the mangoes and slice them, removing the stones. Arrange the
  mangoes on individual plates with rice beside them. Spoon the sauce
  over the rice.
  
  COCONUT RICE (Khao Man):
  
  Coconut rice can be prepared with another ordinary or sticky rice,
  depending on what sort of dish it is to be served with. If using
  sticky rice, soak it first in plenty of water for at least two hours,
  but preferably overnight
  
  If prepared with ordinary rice, serve with Salted Sun-Dried Beef (Nua
  Dad Diao) or other savoury dishes. Sticky coconut rice is delicious
  with mangoes.
  
  2 cups rice 2 cups water 1 cup coconut cream Salt
  
  Rinse and drain the rice and put into a pan with the water, coconut
  cream and salt.  Mix well
  
  Bring to the boil over medium heat.  Reduce the heat and cover.
  
  Simmer for 10 minutes.
  
  When all the liquid has been absorbed, cook for a few more minutes
  over low heat.  The resulting slight burning of the rice at the
  bottom of the pan gives extra flavour to this dish.
  
  All these are from "Discover Thai Cooking" by Chaslin, Canungmai and
  Tettoni, Times Editions, Singapore. 1987.
  
  These are typical of the "street food" that one buys from the vendors
  with mini-kitchens on pushcarts all over Thailand. Thai desserts and
  confections tend to nastily/heavenly sweet and rich. You might be
  careful using the amount of salt called for in these recipes. The
  Thais tend to like their stuff saltier than we would. They even make
  lemonade with salt instead of sugar!

  Here's a bunch of good ol' American recipes, many from Campbell soup

  This is quite a pot-pourri ranging from Julia Childs French onion
  soup to Sloppy Joes to Peanut Butter Cookies. This manicotti one is
  excellent!
  
  Brown meat and garlic in skillet.  Drain fat.  Blend next 4
  ingredients in bowl, stir in meat.  Fill each manicotti, put in
  single layer in 9 x 13-inch pan. Sprinkle with any remaining filling,
  cover with sauce. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese over top. Cover with

      3 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
      4    Eggs
  4 1/2 ts Cold water
           Pinch   salt
      1 tb Olive oil
      3 c  Meat sauce
    1/4 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
           Cheese

MMMMM-------------------STUFFING FOR MANICOTTI------------------------
    3/4 c  Ricotta cheese
    3/4 lb Mozarella cheese, diced
      3    Eggs, lightly beaten
      2 tb Butter
      2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
           Cheese
    1/2 ts Salt
        pn Black pepper
 
        Place flour on a pastry board and make a well in the center.
  Break the eggs into the well and add the water, a little at a time,
  and the salt. Knead for about 10 minutes. Let stand, covered, for
  about 1 hour. Cut dough into 4 pieces and roll as thin as you can.
  Cut into rectangles 4 inches wide by 6 inches long. Place between
  pieces of waxed paper. You should have about 12 pieces.  Cook, half
  at a time, in 4 quarts salted boiling water with olive oul added.
  Cook for 5 minutes. Drain and place between 2 towels.
        Divide stuffing into 12 parts.  Place a mound of stuffing on
  each dough rectangle about 1/3 inch from a long edge. Mound should be
  about 1/2 inch thick and 1/2 inch wide. Fold dough over twice. Spread
  a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a baking pan. Arrange
  manicotti about 1/4 inch apart in the pan and spoon the rest of the
  sauce over the top. Sprinkle a teaspoon of Parmesan cheese over each
  of the manicotti. Bake in a preheated slow (300 F) oven for 15 to 20
  minutes. Drain the ricotta cheese.  Combine all of the ingredients
  and mix well.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Container whole or skim
           Milk ricotta cheese
      1 oz Chunk whole-milk mozzarella
           Cheese, shredded
      1 oz Pkg. frozen chopped spinach
           Thawed and squeezed as dry
           As possible
    1/2 c  Fresh grated Parmesan cheese
      4 lg Eggs, slightly beaten
    1/2 c  Fresh snipped parsley
    1/2 c  Scallions sliced thin
      1 ts Salt
           Freshly ground pepper to
           Taste
 
  Contributed to the echo by: Stephanie DiCamillo MANICOTTI FILLING
  
  Saute scallions in 2 tablespoons olive oil in a small frying pan for
  about 5 minutes (if desired, you can use them uncooked as well).
  Meanwhile, in a large bowl whisk eggs slightly. Add remaining
  ingredients to bowl, including scallions, stirring to mix with a
  large heavy spoon. NOTE: When adding spinach, try to break it up as
  you add it, mixing will be much easier.
  
  Cook pre-packaged Manicotti shells following package directions, only
  UNDERcook them by about 2 minutes. (Undercooking will make them less
  likely to break, and they will absorb any excess moisture released by
  the cheeses during baking.)
  
  Stuff manicotti carefully with filling. Place a little bit of sauce in
  bottom of baking dish, and place manicotti side by side in one layer
  in baking dish. Spoon sauce over, sprinkle with a little additional
  Parmesan cheese. Cover and bake at 325 degrees for 30 minutes,
  uncover and bake 10 minutes more until bubbly.

      Title: MANIFOLD DESTINY ENGINE BLOCK BURGERS (YMMV)
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Bag lf pita bread
      1    Piece of aluminum foil
      1    Better n'Burgers
 
  I travel quite a bit.  Most of the time I'm on commercial airplanes,
  but on occasion I have to drive. A few weeks ago I dropped my wife
  off in a remote part of Northern Georgia. When I reached Tennesee, It
  was time to stop and refill my cooler. The supermarket had Better n
  Burgers at a price much lower than in Chicago so I decided to buy
  four packages. As I was about to check out a thought hit me.
  
  Now dear readers, are you sitting down?  What you are about to read
  really happened and I strongly reccomend it to all vlf travelers.
  
  I picked up a bag of lf pita bread, a roll of aluminum foil and a
  bottle of Katsup.  After paying for my supplies I went to my car and
  unrolled a piece of foil about three feet long.
  
  In the middle of the foil I placed one of the newly purchased Better n
  Burgers.  The sides were folded and sealed. This left a long foil
  pack with a "burger" in the middle. OK, are you ready for this? I
  popped open the hood of the car and placed the foil packet directly
  on the engine. The long tails on the packet gave me enough foil to
  secure the burger on various engine outcropings.
  
  I closed the hood and drove for about 30 minutes.
  
  After a little experimenting, I learned that it takes about 1 1/2
  hours to cook the burger if you have it directly on the valve cover.
  Results may vary.
  
  The packet was retrieved, the "burger" was placed into a pita half
  and I munched merrily along I-24.
  
  Ahh, manifold destiny.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Butternut squash
      1 lg Onion, chopped
      3 oz Swiss cheese, grated
      1 ts Chopped parsley
      1 ts Chopped chives
    1/2 c  Butter
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/2 c  Risotto rice
    1/2 c  White wine

  1 1/2 lb Chicken breast, boneless,
           -skinless, quartered
    1/4 c  Maple syrup
    1/8 c  Dried cranberries
 
  Peel and grate the butternut squash. Melt half the butter in a
  skillet and saute the squash and half the onion together until
  translucent. Stir in the cheese, parsley, and chives. Set aside. Heat
  the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Saute the remaining
  onion. Add the rice and wine, stirring constantly. Reduce. Add one
  and a half cups of the chicken stock, one-half cup at a time,
  stirring until absorbed. The rice is done when still slightly
  crunchy. Combine with the squash mixture. Fry the chicken breasts in
  the remaining butter a few minutes on each side. Add the maples
  syrup, cranberries, and remaining chicken stock. Cook for a few
  minutes over low heat, or until the sauce is slightly reduced. Serve
  over the squash risotto.

  Chicken and pork are often baked or braised in maple syrup in the

  whole cut-up broiler-fryer chicken. It's from the collection of
  Jeanne d'Arc Nadeau, long-time proprietor of Le Danube Bleu reception
  hall in St. Marie and a cookbook author.
  
    Dredge chicken pieces in flour seasoned with salt and pepper to
  taste. In a heavy, flameproof casserole, heat butter until bubbling
  and brown chicken pieces. Pour maple syrup over chicken. Sprinkle
  with savory, thyme and sage. Arrange onion slices on top of chicken
  pieces. Pour water into the bottom of the casserole. Bake, uncovered
  in 350F oven for 50 to 60 minutes or until tender, basting
  occasionally with pan juices. SERVES: 4

 Categories: Smoking
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------BRINE--------------------------------
    1/2 c  Salt
    1/3 c  Sugar brown
    1/2 ts Maple flavoring
      1 ts Onion powder
      1 ts Celery salt
      1 c  White wine
      1 tb Pepper
      3 c  Water
 
  Place turkey in brine for 8 to 12 hours.  Remove from brine. Rinse
  and air dry for at least one hour.  Open upper and lower body
  cavities to expose to smoke. Place in smoker and smoke with your
  favorite fuel. Smoke for 30 minutes per pound approximately.  i.e. 10
  lbs = 5 hours
  
  Remove from smoker and bake in the oven at 300 degrees for about 15
  minutes per pound.  You may also use your smoker, if it is a
  convertable model, in a roast mode to cook the turkey. Turkey is done
  when joints separate easily from the body and if the meat is pierced
  with a toothpick the juices are clear.  Watch the bird closely during
  the roasting phase as different birds will require greatly differing
  time for cooking depending upon the temperature of the smoker.
  
  NOTE:  If desired the brown sugar may be replaced with maple syrup
  giving the bird a more maple flavor.

 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    5-7 lb fully-cooked bone-in
           -ham (shank or butt)
  1 1/2 c  Maple syrup
      1 ts Ginger
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
    1/2 ts Allspice
     16    Whole cloves
           Pineapple slices, canned
           Marachino cherries
 
  Directions: Use a fully-cooked whole, shank or butt ham increasing
  cooking time for larger whole ham.  If a country ham is used, soak it
  in water or apple cider (for a sweet flavor) a few hours or overnight
  to remove some of the salty taste. Remove thick skin if a strong
  smoke flavor is desired. Trim fat leaving no more than 1/2" thick
  covering.
   Score ham. Combine syrup, ginger, nutmeg and allspice. Place ham in a
  large dish and baste with syrup mixture. Let the ham stand in syrup
  for 1 to 2 hours or until it reaches room temperature; baste
  frequently with syrup. When ready to smoke, remove ham from dish,
  stud with cloves and place on smoker grid. Baste with syrup at least
  twice while smoking. Before last hour of smoking, decorate with
  canned pineapple slices and cherries, baste again.  If using a meat
  thermometer, fully cooked ham should reach an internal temperature of
  130-140 degrees. Make certain the thermometer is not touching the
  bone. CHARCOAL: Use 7-8 lbs. charcoal, 3 quarts hot water, 3-4 wood
  sticks and smoke 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours. ELECTRIC: Use 3 quarts hot
  water, 3-4 wood sticks, and smoke 2-3 hours. GAS: Use 4 quarts hot
  water, 3-4 wood sticks, and smoke 2-3 hours. Formatted for Compu-Chef

 Categories: Legumes, Bbq, Posted-mm, Suzy
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Navy beans
      1 lg Onion, cut in half
      5    Whole cloves
      1 lg Onion, whole
    1/3 c  Dark brown sugar
    1/2 c  Maple syrup, *Amber Grade
           Plus to taste

           Plus to taste
      1 ts Salt, or minus to taste
           -Fresh grd. pepper, to taste
 
  Wash and pick over beans to remove small stones. In a large saucepan,
  place the beans with the onion halves and pour in enough water to
  cover them by 2-inches. Bring to a boil; boil 2 minutes. Remove from
  heat, cover and let stand for 1 hour.
  
  Drain and discard the onion. Fill the pan with an equal amount of
  fresh hot water and bring to a boil. Simmer the beans for
  approximately 20-30 minutes, or until partially done. Drain, but
  reserve cooking water.
  
  In the meantime preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Stick the cloves
  in the whole onion and place it in a bean pot. Place the beans on top.
  
  In a small bowl, combine sugar, maple syrup, mustard, salt, and
  pepper, and stir in 1/2 cup of bean cooking water. Pour this mixture
  over the beans, cover the pot, and place in the middle of the oven.
  
  Bake for about 2 1/2 hours. Uncover the pot and bake another half
  hour to brown the top. Check that the beans do not cook dry. Taste
  the beans, add a little more syrup and/or mustard if necessary.

      Title: MAPLE MUSTARD GAME HENS
 Categories: Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2    Cornish game hens, about
           -1/4 pounds each
      1 tb Dijon mustard
      2 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 c  Peanut oil or other
           -vegetable oil (not olive)
    1/3 c  Pure maple syrup
      8    To 10 peppercorns
      1 lg Bay leaf, crumbled
      1 lg Garlic clove, quartered
 
  Here's a poultry recipe that uses maple syrup and mustard++a combo I
  sometimes use on BBQ pork ribs. Looks good here.
  
  Use a sharp chef's knife or kitchen shears to cut the backbone and
  rib cage from the birds.  Starting just to one side of the tail, cut
  all the way to the other end, right beside the backbone. Repeat on
  the other side. You will now have removed the backbone and the hen
  will lie more or less flat. This makes it easy to see the fans of the
  rib bones.
  
  Remove them, too.  Wipe the meat with a damp paper towel and set the
  hens aside.
  
  Put the mustard in a small bowl.  Beat in the lemon juice with a wire
  whisk, then beat in first the oil, then the maple syrup. Sprinkle the
  peppercorns, bay leaf and garlic in a shallow noncorrodible pan or
  bowl just large enough to hold the flattened hens in a single layer.
  
  Pour in about a quarter of the marinade.  Add the meat, cut side
  down, and pour the remaining marinade over it. Cover tightly and
  refrigerate for 1 day (or at least a few hours), turning from time to
  time.
  
  Remove the meat from the refrigerator about 1 hour before cooking.
  
  At cooking time, move the rack so the hens will be in the upper third
  of the oven; preheat oven to 400F.
  
  Drain excess marinade from the hens and arrange them, cut side down,
  in a shallow noncorrodible roasting pan. Roast for 20 minutes, baste,
  raise the heat to 425F and roast for about 20 minutes more. Do not
  turn the meat, which should be well browned by the end of the cooking
  time.
  
  Serve garnished with the watercress.
  
  Serves 2.

      Title: MAPLE SNOW (CANADA)
 Categories: Snacks
      Yield: 4 Children
 
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
      1 c  Of clean snow;
           ->OR<-
      1    Tray of ice cubes;
    1/2 c  Maple syrup;

MMMMM-------------------------EQUIPMENT------------------------------
           Pan or bowl
           Measuring cup
           Saucepan
           4 small paper cups
           Tablespoon
 
  How to Make:  Fill a pan with snow.  Be sure it is clean. Have all
  your ingredients ready before you bring in the snow, so it doesn't
  have time to melt. If there isn't any snow, make crushed ice. An easy
  way to do this is wrap a few cubes of ice at time in a kitchen towel
  and pound them with a heavy object, such as a rolling pin. Put the
  crushed in a bowl. Continue until all the cubes are crushed. Heat the
  maple syrup in the saucepan over low heat for about two minutes until
  it is warm. Remove it from the heat. Fill each paper cup with enough
  snow or ice to make a rounded top. Drop a tablespoon or more of maple
  syrup on top of the snow or ice. Note: You can use either pure maple
  syrup or maple-flavored syrup for this recipe.
  
  STORY: In the center of Canada's flag is a red maple leaf-a symbol of
  Canada's many maple trees.  No wonder everyone likes to turn out in
  the early spring to help collect the sweet liquid from the sugar
  maples. The snow is still on the ground.  The sap is gathered and
  boiled down into maple syrup.  As a special treat, the hot syrup is
  poured over fresh snow. With cider and doughnuts, cups of sweet Maple
  Snow make festive refreshments at a sugaring-off party.

      2 c  Flour
      2 ts Baking powder
      1 pn Salt

      1 ts Vanilla extract
           Creme fraiche
 
  Canadian food writer Anita Stewart shared this recipe that she
  gathered at L'Escapade, an inn at Mont Tremblant, Quebec. With a few
  modifications, it has become one of my standby quick-and-easy
  desserts. The sauce poured over the top ends up on the bottom.
  
  Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 2-quart glass casserole or
  other baking dish.
  
  In a bowl, combine the sugar, flour, baking powder, and salt and stir
  to mix well. Whisk in the milk and 1/4 cup of the butter to blend
  well. Scrape the fairly stiff batter into the prepared baking dish.
  
  In a saucepan, bring the syrup to a boil. Remove from the heat and
  stir in the remaining 1/4 cup butter and the vanilla. Immediately
  pour the mixture over the pudding batter. Bake until puffy, bubbling,
  and golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes.
  
  Serve warm. Offer creme fraiche or a pitcher of cream for topping the
  pudding at the table.

    3/4 c  Sugar
      1    Egg yolk
  1 1/2 ts Whipping cream
  1 1/3 c  Flour
 
  ICE CREAM:
  
  Combine 1-1/2 cups maple syrup with vanilla beans in heavy medium
  saucepan over medium heat and cook until candy thermometer registers
  220F. Let mixture cool 15 minutes.
  
  Heat milk in saucepan.  Whisk yolks to blend in bowl. Whisk in milk
  in thin stream.  Whisk into maple syrup mixture. Set over low heat
  and stir with wooden spoon until syrup is thick enough to leave path
  when finger is drawn across spoon.  Strain into bowl and cool.
  
  Set aside 1-1/2 cups custard for sauce.  Transfer remaining custard
  to ice cream maker and process according to manufacturer's
  instructions. Freeze in container four to six hours to mellow.  (Can
  be prepared one day ahead. If frozen solid, let soften 30 minutes in
  refrigerator.)
  
  Boil remaining 1 cup syrup to 215F.  Add butter.  Cool to room
  temperature.
  
  SABLE RAFTS:
  
  Cream butter and sugar in bowl.  Beat in yolk and cream. Stir in
  flour. Shape dough into ball.  Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at
  least two hours. (Can be prepared up to two weeks ahead and frozen.
  Let stand in refrigerator overnight before continuing.)
  
  Butter eighteen 3-1/2 x 2-inch barquettes (oval molds). Roll dough
  out on lightly floured surface to thickness of 1/8-inch. Roll up on
  rolling pin and unroll over barquettes. Gently press into molds. Run
  rolling pin over dough to trim edges.  Refrigerate until firm.
  
  Preheat oven to 350F.  Line dough with parchment or foil; fill with
  pie weights or dried beans.  Bake until golden brown around edges,
  about 20 minutes. Remove paper and weights. Bake until bottom is
  crisp, several minutes.  Cool slightly in molds.  Unmold and cool
  completely on rack.
  
  Spoon some of reserved custard onto each plate.  Fill rafts with ice
  cream. Arrange three rafts on each plate. Drop 1/2 teaspoon syrup in

      Title: MAPLE SYRUP~ NOT JUST FOR YOUR SWEET TOOTH
 Categories: Syrup, Maple, Text
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           By Carol Ferguson.
 
  It's no contest: Eastern Canada is the world's number one producer of
  maple syrup, supplying about 75 percent of the world's stock. The
  rest comes mostly from the northeastern United States, mainly
  Vermont. Of Canadian production, about 90 percent comes from Quebec
  and the remainder ffrom Ontario, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.
  "Sugaring-Off" season has become a popular tourist attraction,
  particularly in Quebec, where visitors enjoy sleigh rides or
  snowshoeing, old time music and dancing, a warming drink called
  CARIBOU made with red wine and maple syrup, and a feast of
  traditional cooking.  Dishes made with maple syrup include ham in
  maple syrup, maple baked beans, eggs poached in maple syrup, relishes
  and chunky ketchups (often served with tortiere's) delectable crepes,
  and maple syrup pie.  Everyone loves 'tire sur la neige' (hot syrup
  dribbled over fresh snow to make maple taffy).
  
  During pioneer times in good sap-producing regions, maple syrup and
  maple sugar were used every day in cooking, including many savory
  dishes as well as sweets. Today we're inclined to associate maple
  syrup with pancakes or dessert recipes, but we shouldn't forget that
  maple syrup is not just sweetness.  It is also a seasoning that
  enhances many dishes. Its flavour is smooth and mellow, with a subtle
  sweetness that's compatible with meat (especially pork), poultry, and
  vegetables. It adds character to simple egg or bean dishes, enriches
  breads and muffins, and rounds out the flavor of piquant sauces and
  spicy condiments.

      Title: MAPLE-OAT BREAKFAST BUNS (ABM)
 Categories: Digest, Jan., Breakfast
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    2/3 c  Rice milk
      1    Egg sub. equivalent for 1
           Egg
      1 tb Applesauce (sub. for
           B*tt*r)
      2 c  Bread flour
    1/3 c  Oat flour (process rolled
           Oats in food proc.)
      4 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Yeast
    1/3 c  Maple syrup
    1/4 c  Brown sugar
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
    1/8 ts Nutmeg
    1/2    To 1 cup raisins
    2/3 c  Rolled oats, toasted in 350
           Oven for 10min. or until
           Light brown
 
  Add the first 8 ingredients to bread machine according to
  manufacturer's
  
  instructions.  Set it for the dough setting (mine calls it the manual
  cycle).  When cycle is complete, remove dough from machine. Cover and
  let rise 10 min. In a small saucepan, stir together the syrup, spices
  and brown sugar. Cook over low heat until sugar is dissolved, remove
  from heat and stir in raisins and toasted rolled oats. Set aside.
  
  On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 12x8 rectangle. Spread
  raisin mixture over dough to all edges. Roll up jelly roll style,
  pinch seams to seal. Cut into 1 inch slices. Place rolls, cut sides
  down, on non stick cookie sheet. I gave my sheet a couple of spritzs
  with cooking spray and I think it helped. When the rolls come out,
  you need to use a spatula to pry them off the pan, because the brown
  sugar will have stuck, but they come right up. These had just the
  right amount of sweetness. Enjoy!

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 x  * * * * Seasoning Mix * *
  1 1/2 ts Onion powder
      1 ts Salt  (omit if canned stock
           Is used)
      1 ts Sweet paprika
      1 ts Garlic powder
    3/4 ts Dry mustard
    1/4 ts Black pepper
    1/4 ts White pepper (I didn't have
           Any)
      1 x  * * * * Ingredients * * *
      2 c  Chopped onion, in all
      1 c  Chopped celery, in all
      4 c  Fresh corn kernals, in all
           (see below)
      2 c  Stock, in all (or one 14.5
           Oz can of stock)
    1/2 c  Apple juice
    1/2 c  Prune juice (or one 5.5
           Oz can)
      1    Red bell pepper, chopped
    1/2 c  Evaporated skim milk (or 1/2
        c  Mixed double strength from
           Dry)
    1/4 c  Non-fat milk powder
 
  1) Combine seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl 2) Combine 1 cup
  onions, 1/2 cup celery and 2 cups corn in a blender (or food
  processor) with 1/2 cup stock. Puree until completely smooth. 3)
  Place the pureed mixture in a hot skillet and cook scraping
  periodically for 12 to 13 minutes.  Prudhomme says this is the most
  important step in developing the flavor.  Cook a few minutes until a
  crust forms, scrape of the crust in and mix well.  Allow another
  crust to form, blend in and repeat until the mixture is very thick
  and dark brown. 4) At the end of 12 minutes or so, add apple and
  prune juice, remaining vegetables, seasoning mix and stock. Scrape to
  clear bottom of skillet and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cook 35
  minutes, checking bottom of skillet for sticking (expecially near the
  end) 5) Combine dry milk powder and evaporated milk until
  compleletely dissolved.  Add to skillet while stirring, bring to a
  simmer and cook 5 minutes.

  Prudhomme says to use the freshest and sweetest corn available. This
  time of year I figured  frozen corn would be better than fresh, so I
  used Green Giant Extra Sweet, which was actually a little too sweet.
  I think it was one of those new hybrids that are  super sweet and
  also extra crispy. To make it again I'd use half extra sweet and half
  regular. I also threw in the last of a can of golden hominy, which
  actually made a nice contrast in taste and texture, so actually next
  time I might end up with three kinds of corn in it -- how's that for
  gourmet cooking! The red bell pepper was my idea, since I thought the
  color would be a nice touch. Tastes wonderful. I bought the tiny cans
  of prune juice since I figured I wouldn't be able to use up a big
  jar. I also just used dry milk made up double concentrated instead of
  evaporated milk.
