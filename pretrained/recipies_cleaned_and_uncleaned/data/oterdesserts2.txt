Imperial Coconut Flan

deserts

2 cup milk
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1  small coconut
5  small eggs, separated
1  pinch   salt
1  flan mold coated with
1  caramel

Preheat the oven to 450F.

Place the sugar and milk in a heavy saucepan and melt the sugar
over low heat, then raise the heat and boil the mixture briskly. Take
care that it does not boil over. As soon as the mixture begins to
thicken, stir it so that it does not stick to the bottom of the pan.
After about 30 minutes it should be the consistency of thin condensed
milk and has been reduced to 1 cup.  See Note.

Pierce holes through two of the "eyes" of the coconut and drain
the water from it.  Set the water aside.

Put the whole coconut into the oven for about 8 minutes. Crack it
open; the flesh should come away quite easily from the shell.

Pare the brown skin from the coconut flesh with a potato peeler.
Grate the coconut finely.  You will need 2 1/4 cups, loosely packed,
for the flan.

Add the grated coconut to the reserved coconut water and boil it
for about 5 minutes, stirring it constantly.

Add the "condensed" milk and continue cooking for another 5
minutes. Set the mixture aside to cool.

Beat the egg yolks together until they are creamy and stir them
well into the coconut mixture.

Beat the egg whites until they are frothy, add the salt and
continue beating until they are stiff. Fold them into the mixture.

Pour the mixture into the prepared mold.  Cover the mold with a
well-greased lid and place into a water bath.

Cook the flan on the lowest shelf of the oven for about 1 1/2
hours, then test to see if it is done. When it is done, set it aside
to cool.

Makes 6 servings.

NOTES:
Of course, you can substitute1 cup of lightly thinned canned,
sweetened condensed milk for the milk and sugar and substitute
pre-grated but unsweetened coconut. Use milk instead of coconut
water; the flavor will just not be quite as good.

Do not think you have done something wrong when you see that the
coconut and custard have separated. That is how it is meant to be. The
caramel will nearly all have been absorbed by the spongy layer of
coconut.

If you are using fresh coconut there will almost certainly be
some left over.  It will keep perfectly well if frozen.

To test to see if the flan is cooked through, insert the blade
of a knife or a skewer well into the flan. The knife should come out
clean. Take care not to pierce the flan at the bottom or it will
spoil the appearance of the top when it is unmolded.

Indian Mango Sorbet

deserts, indian

1  text only

Mango sorbet are always delicious but this one has the added interest
of lime and cardamom flavours.  The recipe comes from the recently
published "Quick and Easy Indian Vegetarian Cookery" by Sandeep
Chatterjee. BBC Books, 1992, $16.95.

Put 150 g sugar in a small saucepan with 150 mL water. Stir until the
sugar has dissolved then simmer briskly 3 to 4 minutes to make a
syrup. Remove from the heat and chill. When it is cold, add it to 275
g ripe mango pulp, together with the juice of 1 lime and a third of a
tablespoon of ground cardamom.

Mix well and then freeze in a metal container.  As it is freezing,
whisk it with a fork from time to time.

Serves 4 to 6.

Indian Pudding (Roberta Krieger)

deserts

1 quart milk
2/3 cup cornmeal
3/4 cup molasses
1/4 cup butter [i've tried margarine, but i; t doesn't taste the same]
3 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon ginger
1 teaspoon salt

Supposedly, this is an authentic recipe from Daniel Boone's wife
Rebecca.

Ice cream [I prefer vanilla]

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Bring milk to a boil in the top part of
a double boiler. Stir in cornmeal and cook over hot water for 15
minutes. Stir in molasses [I use the light variety, but I guess dark
would work as well], and cook for 5 minutes longer. Remove from heat.
Stir in butter, sugar, ginger, and salt. Turn into an oven casserole
and bake 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Serve warm with ice cream.

Daniel and Rebecca served this warm with fresh-churned butter.

Here is the recipe I think that you are looking for. It is called

Passover. The cookbook is from Temple Beth Hillel-Beth El in
Wynnewood, Pa.

Boil ingredients together in a large saucepan until the mixture is
thick and forms a ball. (Mixture should retain shape when dropped in
a glass of cold water) Roll small amounts on board covered with sugar
or matzah meal. Roll into heavy cigar shapes (3" long) or flatten

1 oz to 8 oz bottle corn syrup
2 lb rolled oats

(For all the birds at Pocomoonshine Lake, Maine)

Melt the suet in a canning kettle or other large container, pouring
the melted fat into another kettle as it cooks down. While the fat is
still hot, add the peanut butter, corn syrup, and oats, stirring
constantly until mixture is well blended.  Put the pudding into old
soup cans to cool and harden, and store in a cool place. To use, warm
the can until the pudding is soft enough to handle.  Drill a number
of 1 to 1-1/2 inch holes in a 4 inch diameter birch log (leave the
bark intact to provide toeholds for the birds)  Spread the pudding
into the holes, and hang the log outdoors where it is accessible to
the birds.

Jalebis (Deep-Fried Pretzel-Shaped Sweets)

deserts, vegatarian, vegetarian

      ----JALEBIS----
3 cup flour, all-purpose
1/4 cup flour, rice
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
2 cup water; lukewarm
      ----SYRUP----
4 cup sugar, granulated
3 cup water; cold
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
2 teaspoon food coloring, yellow
1/8 teaspoon food coloring, red
1 teaspoon rose water
1 single oil, vegetable

Batter: In deep bowl, make a smooth batter of the flours, baking
powder and lukewarm water. Let batter rest unrefrigerated and
uncovered 12 hours.
Syrup: Immediately before frying the jalebis, combine sugar, cold
water and cream of tarter in 4 qt. saucepan. Stir over moderate heat
until sugur dissolves. Increase heat to high and cook briskly,
undisturbed for 5 minutes, until 220F on a candy thermometer. Remove
from heat, stir in coloring and rose water. Pour into a bowl and set
aside.
Jalebis: Pour 3 cups vegetable oil into a 10" karhai or 12" wok or
into a deep fryer to 2-3 inches. Heat oil to 350F. Spoon 1 1/2 cups
of the batter into a pastry bag fitted with a plain tube 3/16"
diameter. Squeezing batter directly into hot oil, loop a stream of
batter back and forth 4-5 times to form a sort of pretzel made up of
alternating figure 8s and circles, one over the other. Each jalebi
should be about 3" long and 2" wide.
In batches of 5-6, fry the jalebis for 2 minutes, or until golden
on both sides. As they brown, transfer them to the syrup for a
minute, then place them on a plate. Serve warm or at room temperature.

guide. Serve with custard sauce or whipped cream. Makes 6 to 8
servings.

Jellies

condiments, deserts, jam/jelly, japanese

1  text only

Select and wash fruits.  Remove stems, hulls, and blossom ends. Cut
hard fruit in quarters.  Do not pare or remove seeds.

Extraction of Juice Soft Fruit: Use just enough water to prevent
fruit from sticking.  Heat gradually, stirring constantly. Crush
fruit and cook until it has lost its color. Hard Fruit: Cook, with
sufficient water to cover, until fruit is soft. Do not crush if a
clear jelly is desired.

Straining the Juice:  Pour cooked fruit into a wet flannel jelly bag.
Allow juice to drip into a large container. Do not squeeze fruit if a
clear jelly is desired. When juice has stopped dripping return pulp
to preserving kettle.  Add sufficient water to cover. Cook slowly,
stirring constantly, for thirty minutes. Again strain juice, but keep
this second extraction separate from the first as the first
extraction makes the clearest jelly. A third extraction may be made
from some fruits, depending upon the pectin content.

Test for Pectin:  Combine 1 tablespoon cooked fruit juice, 1 teaspoon
sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon Epsom salts. Stir until salts dissolve. Allow
to stand about 20 minutes. If juice contains sufficient pectin to
make jelly, the mixture will form into a gelatinous mass or large
flaky particles. If fruit juice shows only a small amount of pectin,
use an equal volume of apple juice, which is rich in pectin, and a
satisfactory jelly will be obtained.

Sugar Content of Jelly:  Too large a proportion of sugar will result
in a gummy jelly which can not be molded. Too small a proportion of
sugar will result in a tough, dark jelly with an inferior flavor.
Currants, unripe grapes, and green gooseberries are about the only
fruits which require an equal measure of sugar. Two-thirds as much
sugar as fruit juice is the usual rule.

Cooking the Jelly:  Work with a small quantity of juice, not more
than two quarts at a time. Measure juice, heat rapidly to boiling.
Add sugar, stir until it is dissolved. Boil rapidly until a jelly
test is obtained. The sugar may be heated before adding to boiling
juice if desired.

The Jelly Test: Dip a spoon into the boiling liquid. Pour juice from
spoon. If it sheets and two drops hang together from the side of the
spoon, the jelly is done and must be removed from the fire
immediately. Skim.

Sealing and Storing:  Pour the jelly immediately into freshly

Jell-O Parfait

deserts, fruits

3 oz lime jell-o
3 oz cherry jell-o
3 oz lemon jell-o
1/2 cup ; water, boiling
10 oz pineapple, crushed; juice reserved
1/2 pint sour cream
1/4 cup pecans; coarsely cut
4 oz maraschino cherries; drained
1  whipped cream

Prepare lime Jell-O according to package instructions; pour into an
8x8 oiled pan.  Refrigerate two hours, or until set. Dissolve the
lemon Jell-O in boiling water. Mix pineapple, sour cream, nuts and
cherries, and add to Jell-O.  Spread carefully on top of congealed
lime Jell-O; refrigerate again until set. Prepare cherry Jell-O, and
quickly cool to room temperature, then pour gently on top of the
lemon layer, being careful not to pour so quickly that the layers
mix. You're trying to achieve a "geological" effect when the parfait
is sliced.

Refrigerate until all layers are set.  Cut into squares and serve
topped with whipped cream.

Jello Snacks For Kids

deserts, snacks

1  (12 oz) can frozen grape juice conc; entrate, thawed
3  envelopes unflavored gelatin
1 1/2 cup (1 can) water

From: Vicki Lansky's CANDY book

GRAPE FINGER JELLO

Soften gelatin in grape juice. Boil the water, add the juice/ gelatin
mixture and stir til gelatin dissolves. Remove from heat, pour into a
lightly greased 9x13 pan and chill. Cut into squares when firm.
Refrigerate in a covered container. This is good lunch box and
traveling fare. It can go unrefrigerated up to 4 hours under normal
(not desert!) conditions.

Variation: substitute frozen cranberry juice cocktail concentrate for
grape juice. Or a 12 oz can frozen apple, pear, apple, juice
concentrate.

SLIPPERY CIRCLES

Let any of the recipes for finger jello stand and chill til thickened
which doesn't take very long (15 to 25 minutes). Place a spoonful of
the gelatin into each of 4 empty and clean 6 oz cans, such as usually
used for frozen orange juice. Cut a peeled banana in half and center
it in the can. Spoon in remaining gelatin. Chill till firm. To
unmold, dip to rim in warm water and let it slide out. Or remove
bottom of can if more appropriate. Cut into slices.

SUNSHINE SQUARES

(A Finger Jello that is good even for breakfast).

4 envelopes unflavored gelatin 3/4 cup pineapple juice 1 cup boiling
water 1/4 cup sugar 1 cup orange juice

Soften gelatin in pineapple juice. Add to boiling water and stir til
dissolved. Add sweetener and orange juice. Chill in a 9x9 inch pan,
then cut into squares. Refrigerate in a covered container. Variation:
If you wish to use honey instead of sugar, decrease the orange juice
by 1/8 of a cup.

APPLE RING SNACKS

Why pay for Weight Watchers Apple Snack when you can make your own?

Peel an apple and remove the core. Slice in rings. Place on alightly
greased cookie sheet, or on clear plastic wrap laid out on a cookie
sheet. Dry in an electric oven at low or warm temperatures, In a gas
oven the pilot light is sufficient. Drying takes 6-9 hours, making
this a good overnight project. The size of the apple slices and your
oven temperature are the variables you will have to experiment with.
The apples need not be dried to a crisp. Store in an airtight
container. These should last several weeks at room temperature. Good
for traveling!

Jennie Grossinger's Knishes

deserts, jewish

2 1/2 cup sifted flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2  eggs
2/3 cup salad oil
2 tablespoon water
1  sift the flour, baking powder and s; alt into a bowl. make a
1  well in the center and drop the egg; s, oil and water into
1  it. work into the flour mixture wit; h the hand and knead
1  until smooth.
1  there are two ways to fill the knis; hes. in either case,
1  divide the dough in two and roll as; thin as possible.
1  brush with oil. now you can spread; the filling on one side
1  of the dough and roll it up, like a; jelly roll.  cut into
5 1/2  inch slices.

Here's the basics, fillings follow in the next messages.

DOUGH:

Place in an oiled baking sheet cut side down.  Press down lightly to
flatten. Or you can cut the rolled dough in 3- inch circles. Place a
tablespoon of the filling on each; draw the edges together and pinch
firmly.  Place on an oiled baking sheet, pinched edges up

In either case, bake in a 375 degree oven 35 minutes or until browned.
Makes about 24.

FILLINGS FOR KNISHES

POTATO: 1 cup chopped onions 6 tablespoons chicken fat or butter 2
cups mashed potatoes 1 egg 1 teaspoon salt
1/4    teaspoon pepper

Brown the onions in the fat or butter. Beat in the potatoes, egg,
salt and pepper until fluffy.

CHEESE 1 1/2 cups diced scallions or onions 4 tablespoons butter 2
cups pot cheese 1 egg 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1/8 teaspoon pepper 2
tablespoons sour cream

Scallions are better than onions for this, so try to get them. Brown
the scallions in the butter and beat in the cheese, egg, salt, pepper
and sour cream until smooth.

MEAT: 1/2 cup minced onions 2 tablespoons chicken fat 1 1/2 cups
ground cooked meat 1/2 cup cooked rice 1 egg 1 teaspoon salt 1/4

Mix all the ingredients until smooth.

And finally, the classic:

POTATO-DOUGH KNISHES

1/4 cup minced onions 6 tablespoons chicken fat or butter 4 cups
mashed potatoes 1/2 cup potato flour 3 eggs 1 teaspoon salt 1/4
teaspoon pepper

Brown the onions in 4 tablespoons chicken fat or butter. Cool.

Knead together the remaining fat or butter, the pota- toes, potato
flour, eggs, salt and pepper. Break off pieces (about 2 inches long)
and flatten slightly. Place a tea- spoon of browned onions on each
and cover by pinching the edges together. Place on a greased baking
sheet. Bake in a 375 degree oven 25 minutes. Makes about 20.

Jien Duy (Deep Fried Sesame Seed Ball)

chinese, deserts

1/2 lb glutinous rice powder
2/3 cup boiling water
2  chinese brown slab sugar (sticks)-; =or=-
1/2 cup dark brown sugar
1/2 cup sweet red bean paste
1/2 cup sesame seeds
1  peanut oil for deep-frying

PLACE THE GLUTINOUS RICE POWDER in a mixing bowl. Bring the water to
a boil and add the sugar; stir until completely dissolved. Pour sugar
water into the rice powder; stir until well mixed. Gather the dough
into a ball and knead until smooth. Cut dough in half and roll each
half into two 10-inch long rolls. Cut each roll into 10 pieces. Take
one piece and roll into a ball. Flatten it and place a 1/2-inch round
piece of sweet red paste into the center of dough. Fold over sides to
enclose filling and roll into a ball. Repeat until all the balls are
made. Wet your hands with water and roll one ball in your hands to
moisten the ball. Dip the ball into a dish of sesame seeds until the
entire surface is covered. Press lightly to help the seeds adhere.
Add enough oil to a wok to a depth of 2 1/2-inches. Heat to 350F.
Deep fry balls for 8 to 10 minutes. As they expand in the oil, take a
pair of chopsticks and squeeze the balls to help them expand and fill
with air. The balls should triple in size, float to the top of the
oil and turn golden brown. Remove and drain on paper towels. Makes
about 20 balls.

forms in cold water - just enough time to pour 1st half into the egg
whites. Add vanilla.  Beat until almost ready to set up.  Add nuts
and beat by hand until ready to set up.  Pour onto a generously
buttered platter. Cut into serving pieces when cooled.

Juan's Killer Flan

deserts

1 can evaporated milk
1 can sweetened condensed milk
2 cup sugar
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/2  lemon; juice only
8  eggs

Preheat oven to 375 . Mix eggs, condensed milk, evaporated milk, 1
cup of the sugar, vanilla and lemon juice in large bowl. Mix well, no
solids allowed, and the sugar must blend very evenly. (Add a little
bit of Amaretto or Bailey's Irish Cream if you feel adventurous, or a
little softened cream cheese). In a meat loaf or bread mold, put the
remaining 1 cup of sugar and the water tilt the mix so that becomes a
syrupy mix. Heat on high, watching it and moving it every once in a
while to spread the heat evenly. When it starts to turn brown, take
it off the heat. The syrup should be a medium caramel color. Put it
in the freezer and let it set. After the caramel sets, pour in the
flan mixture you made in the bowl. Cover TWICE and seal well with
aluminum foil. Put the mold inside another larger pan (double boiler)
and fill the middle with water so that it almost reaches the edge of
the inside mold. It is VERY important to seal the top of the mold; if
steam or hot air gets inside the flan will not come out creamy and
firm (it will look like swiss cheese on the outside). Set oven to
BAKE and cook for 1 hour. Turn oven off and let it cool, then take
the flan out, remove from the larger pan and put it in the fridge to
cool. Ought to serve 8 or so, but I've seen it serve 1 over 3-days.
It will last quite a bit as long as it is refrigerated. +++++DON'T

Judy's Yummy Cinnabon-Type Rolls

breakfast, deserts, snacks, vegatarian, vegetarian

      ----JUDY BERNEY RMMS18B----
      ----DOUGH----
1 cup milk
2  eggs
1/3 cup margerine; softened
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
4 cup all-purpose flour
1 pkg dry yeast; (i like saf brand  use 2
      ----FILLING----
1 1/2  sticks margerine; softened
1 1/4 cup packed brown sugar
3 tablespoon cinnamon; rounded generously
      ----ICING----
1 1/2 cup powdered sugar
1  stick margerine; softened
4 oz cream cheese; softened
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/8 teaspoon salt

To make Cinnabons in the bread machine use the dough setting. Remove
from the Bread machine. FILLING: Spread dougn with the softened
margerine and sprinkle evenly with the brown sugar/cinnamon and roll
with a rolling pin. Roll up jelly roll fashion and cut sharp with a
knife into 12 rolls, about 2" thick. Place rolls in a greased 9 x 13
pan - 3 rows of 4 rolls each. You can bake them right away without a
second rise (yes, that's right) but I like to lwt them rise about 15
minutes in a warm spot, ten bake them in a 400~ oven for about 13-14
minutes. While they're hot from the oven, spread them gently with a
little of the icing. Add more icing after 5 to 10 minutes. NOTE:
After placing them in the pan, you can cover them and refrigerate or
you can freeze them for up to a month. Before baking allow them to
come to room temperature, then let rise for 15 minutes in a warm spot
and bake as directed above.

Kadaifi

deserts, greek

1  karen mintzias
1 lb commercial raw kadaifi dough
1/2 cup sweet butter; melted
1 1/2 cup finely chopped almonds *
3 1/2 cup granulated sugar
1  ground cinnamon
1/2 cup orange juice (optional)
2 cup water
1/2 cup honey
2 tablespoon lemon juice

*Note: Use blanched almonds.

Open the raw kadaifi dough to the air for 10 to 15
minutes.  Spread half the pastry evenly over the
bottom of a 9 x 12 x 3-inch baking pan and brush with
half the butter.  Meanwhile, combine the almonds, 1/2
cup sugar, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, and orange juice in
a small bowl.  (The orange juice will make the mixture
like a paste that can be spread with a knife.) Spread
the almond mixture over the kadaifi and cover with the
remaining dough. Brush with the remaining butter and
bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 40 minutes or
slightly longer, until golden on top.

Meanwhile, boil the remaining 3 cups sugar with water
for 5 minutes.  Stir in the honey and lemon juice,
bring to a boil and keep hot.  When done, remove the
pastry to a rack to cool in the pan, then spoon the
hot syrup over the pastry.  Cover with a dry towel and
allow to cool thoroughly. When cool, cut into square
or diamond shapes of any desired size.  Dust with
additional ground cinnamon just before serving on
dessert plates.

1  egg
1/4 liter milk (1 cup plus 1 tbsp)
1  grated peel of 1 lemon
20 gm sugar (1 1/2 tbsp)
1 pkg vanilla sugar*
1 cup plain breadcrumbs
1 1/2 tablespoon water
3 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon

Shape the rolls into dumplings by rubbing the crust of
all sides.  Put these dumplings into a mixture of egg
yolk, milk, lemon peel, and sugar.

Once they have absorbed the liquid all the way
through, gently squeeze out excess liquid by hand.
Whisk the egg white and water, and dip the dumplings
in this mixture, and then roll them in breadcrumbs.
Deep fry in fat until golden brown, then roll in a
mixture of sugar and cinnamon.

Serves 4.

[*Note:  I would probably use 2 tsp of vanilla sugar.

Kentucky Bourbon Truffles

candy

1/2 lb dark semisweet chocolate*
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 1/2 tablespoon finest kentucky bourbon
1  droste cocoa or
1  shaved chocolate drayettes

*Callebaut, Lindt, Tobler or any fine imported
chocolate.

Break chocolate into small pieces.  Combine it with
the cream in the top of a double boiler over simmering
hot water (not boiling).  Stir the chocolate and cream
constantly until chocolate has melted and ganache is
smooth. Remove from heat and allow to cool.  When the
ganache has cooled, stir in bourbon.

Pour the mixture into a small bowl.  Cover with foil
and refrigerate overnight or several days if desired.

When ready to make the candy, line a baking sheet with
foil.

Working with a small amount of the ganache at a time,
using about 1 1/2 tsp. each, form into balls.  Place
them on the sheet.  (Work quickly, using your
fingertips and not the palm of your hands to help keep
the mixture from becoming overly soft.)

Keep the chocolate balls cold, if possible, by placing
them a few at a time on a tray in the refrigerator.
Leave the chocolate balls lightly covered in the
refrigerator for several hours or overnight, if
desired.

Sprinkle a pastry sheet with cocoa or chocolate
shavings or Drayelle. Roll each ball into the cocoa or
shavings, covering them well. Refrigerate at once and
leave until the truffles are quite firm - several
hours or overnight.

Place each truffle in a fluted silver or paper cup in
a tin box and keep refrigerated.

Serve very cold.  Will keep several weeks under
refrigeration.

Glenn writes: "All the world loves chocolate, and
chocolate truffles are the world's most luscious
trompe l'oeil.  We have no clue as to the name of the
clever cook who first created these candies so
beautifully camouflaged in the shape of a truffle, but
it would be a very safe bet that he was a Frenchman -
and from truffle country.

"In contrast to most hand-dipped chocolates, which, to
a great extent belong in the province of the
professional candy maker and should look precisely
turned out, chocolate truffles are supposed to look
somewhat rugged.  If they looked too neat and evenly
rounded, they wouldn't resemble their namesake - the
knobbly real-life Perigord truffle.

"No pig is needed to sniff around in the deep forest
of the Perigord to find where these truffles grow!
All one needs is a small kitchen space, a
double-boiler of sorts, a spoon or two, a baking
sheet, and a cold spot to let the candy chill."

"In every phase of the culinary arts, flavor is
everything; and premium ingredients must be used to
achieve the subtle counterpoint of flavors that are
possible with the candies given here.

"The ideal way to store or to prepare truffles as
gifts is to place each one in a tiny fluted silver or
paper cup made for the purpose, then fit them in
single layers in a tight tin box.  Wrap the box as
happily as you wish.  Few gifts could say 'Have a
Merry Christmas!' any better.

"Bourbon whiskey has a great affinity for chocolate;
however, no whiskey or liqueur can be added directly
to any chocolate; it hardens it beyond repair.  In
using liqueurs when making chocolate candies,
frostings, etc., the alcohol must be combined with
cream first.  The French call the combination of
chocolate and cream a 'ganache' and that is the base
of many candies, especially truffles."

From Camille Glenn's 12/01/93 "Flavor to Taste" column
called "Visions of Sugarplums: These Truffles and
Candies Just Shout 'Merry Christmas'" in "The
(Louisville, KY) Courier-Journal."  Pg. C1. Typed for

Khanom Mho-Gaeng Puak - Taro Custard.

deserts, thai

4 cup coconut milk
3 cup palm sugar
12 each eggs - beaten
3 cup cooked taro - mashed
1 cup shallots - thinly sliced
1 1/2 cup oil

In a bowl, dissolve palm sugar in the coconut milk and
mix well. Strain through cheese cloth or fine sieve to
remove all solids.  Add mashed taro, eggs, and mix
well. Heat a frying pan, and add oil when it's hot.
Add thinly sliced shallots and saute until they are
crisp and golden brown.  Remove shallots from the oil,
drain and put aside. Put the hot oil into a large
sauce pan and reheat.  Add the coconut milk/egg/taro
mixture and stir constantly with large wooden spoon
over moderate heat until the mixture starts to boil
lightly and thickened. Remove from heat and pour the
mixture into a deep tray (large Pyrex tray or
rectangular sheet cake pan, for example) and bake in
350 F oven until it's cooked through, and the surface
is nicely browned. Remove from the oven, and spread
the fried shallot pieces all over the top.  Cut into 2
inch squares, when cooled, and use a spatula to remove
from the pan onto a serving platter. NOTE:  This is a
variation of the original "Khanom Mho-Gaeng" which
uses mashed, cooked, split peas in place of the taro
("puak").

Kheer

deserts, ethnic

4 cup milk
1 tablespoon long grained rice
4  whole cardomom pods; slightly crushed
1 tablespoon sugar
10  pistachios, unsalted and slivered,; plus a few for garnish

Combine themilk, rice, and cardamom pods in a
heavy-bottomed pot.  Bring to a boil.  Lower the heat
and reduce the milk until you have 2 cups.* This may
take 1-1 1/4 hours.  Turn off heat. Remove cardamom
pods and discard.  Add sugar and nuts,  Mix well and
leave to cool.  Mix again and pour into a serving
bowl.  Decorate with a few more slivered pistachios on
top.  Cover bowl with light plastic wrap. Refrigerate.
Serve cold.

*Note:  How to boil milk down
1 Use a very heavy-bottomed pot.  Cast iron or
aluminium covered with porcelain.
2 Since the process is slow and tedious bring a chair
and book to stove. 3 Bring the milk to an "almost"
boil.  Watch it.  If you let it boil over you will
have a big mess to clean.  As soon as it seems that
the milk will start to boil and rise, turn heat sown
to medium low. 4 Adjust heat so that milk is always
bubblingm but will not boil over. 5 Once the milk has
begun its slow boil, settle down with your book.  Stir
milk every few minutes. 6 If a creamy crust forms on
top, just stir it into the milk.  It will taste fine
when cold.

Kotonjata (Christmas Candy)

candy, deserts, fruits

13 large quince
2  lemons
2 cup water
1  sugar
1 cup lemon juice; strained

Select desired number of even colored (not spotted)
quince.  I use 13 large quince.  Wash and peel as you
would an apple.  Use a shredder and grate on largest
holes.  Place all meat in a heavy pot with juice of 2
lemons and 2 cups of water.  Cook over lowest flame
for at least an hour or an hour and a half.  Test to
see if quince is soft. Remove from fire. Measure the
cooked quince by cup and return to pot. Add equal
number of quince and sugar in the same pot.  Stir well
until blended. Cook on medium heat, watching carefully
that it doesn't scorch. Reduce heat to lowest setting
for an hour, stirring frequently. After first half
hour add 1 cup strained lemon juice. Test quince by
placing a teaspoonful on a small plate. If it doesn't
run, it's ready to pour on platters or in Pyrex
bakiing dish about 1/4 inch thick.  Let dry for 3
days, turning frequently. Cut in smaller pieces to
help turn easier.  When hardened, wrap and refrigerate
until used.

M&M/Mars 3 Musketeers

candy, dressings, seafood

3 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup light corn syrup
3/4 cup water
1/8 teaspoon salt
3  egg whites
1/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips
2  bags milk chocolate chips
1  (12-ounce bags)

1.  In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar, corn
syrup, water, adn salt.  Heat, stirring, to boiling, then continue to
cook, using a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature. 2. Beat
the egg whites until they are stiff and form peaks.  Don't use a
plastic bowl for this. 3. When the sugar solution comes to 270
degrees F, or the soft-crack stage, remove from the heat and pour the
mixture in thin streams into the egg whites, blending completely with
a mixer set on low speed. 4. Continue to mix until the candy begins
to harden to the consistency of dough. This may take as long as 20
minutes.  At this point, add the semisweet chocolate chips.  Remember
that the candy must already be at the consistency of dough when you
add the chocolate;  the nougat will thicken no more after the
chocolate is added. 5.  When the chocolate is thoroughly blended and
the nougat has thickened, press it into a greased 9x9-inch pan.
Refrigerate until firm, about 30  minutes. 6. With a sharp knife, cut
the candy in half down the middle of the pan. Then cut across into 7
segments to create a total of 14 bars. 7.  Melt the milk chocolate
chips in the microwave for 2 minutes on half  power, stirring halfway
through the heatingtime. Melt completely, but be careful not to
overheat. 8. Resting a bar on a fork (and using your fingers if
needed), dip each  bar into the chocolate to coat completely and
place on wax paper. Cool till firm at room temperature, 1 to 2 hours.
Makes 14 candy bars.

Making Horehound Drops

candy, seasonings

1 cup fresh horehound leaves
1 cup water
2 cup sugar
2 tablespoon corn syrup or honey

Put the horehound in a small nonreactive sauce pan and add the water.
Bring to a boil and simmer, covered, or 20 minutes. Allow to cool,
then remove horehound and squeeze out all the liquid. Add the sugar
and corn syrup or honey to the pan, stir with a wooden spoon while
bringing to a boil, then turn heat down to a gentle simmer. If
bubbles threaten to overflow the pan, reduce heat slightly and stir.

Boil to the hard-crack stage.  If you have a candy thermometer, this
is in the range of 330 F, but even so you'll need to test often
toward the end of cooking to get the hardness right. Keep a shallow
cup of cold water nearby. Stir the liquid occasionally, and watch how
it falls from the spoon. When it forms a thread, begin testing for
hardness by allowing a drop of the mixture to fall into the cup of
cold water. Don't trust your fingers to examine the now-hardened drop
in the cup; bite it. If it's at all gooey or sticks to your teeth,
keep cooking. When it's hard enough to crack when you bite it, remove
the pan from heat immediately.

If the mixture crystallizes, just add a cup of water and an extra
tablespoon of corn syrup or honey to the pan, scrape all the
crystalline chunks into it, and begin again.

Lightly butter a candy mold, cookie sheet, or other heatproof baking
pan, and pour in the hot mixture.  If you're using a flat-bottomed
pan, score the surface of the candy after it has cooled enough to
become firm. This will help in breaking it apart, which should be
done as soon as the candy can be handled.

After individual "drops" are formed, sift granulated sugar or powdered
sugar over them to keep them from sticking together. Store in a
moisture-proof container.

Marchepane

candy

2 lb skinned, blanched whole almonds
1  ice water
4  egg whites
2 2/3 cup confectioners sugar
1/2 cup orange juice

Colors: Natural, or, if necessary, artificial parsley or mallow for
green sandalwood or alkanet for red saffron or dandelion for yellow
blue turnsole for light blue violets for lavender

1. In a mortar and pestal or a blender, grind the almonds to a thick
paste. Add small amounts of ice water, about 1/2 tsp. at a time, to
prevent the almonds from becoming to oily.  Place almond paste in a
large mixing bowl. 2.  In another bowl, beat egg whites until they
peak. Gradually beat in the sugar. 3. Add the sweetened egg whites to
the almond paste. With fingers wet in orange juice, knead the
resulting mixture. If the mixture is too sticky to handle, add small
amounts of orange juice, 1 tsp. at a time. Thoroughly knead for about
10 minutes. 4. Separate the marzipan into several sections, on for
every color required for your sculpture. 5. In a separate small
mixing bowl for each color, place the marzipan portions and cover the
bowl tightly with a clean cloth tied securely or with aluminum foil.
Allow these to ripen or "age" in refrigerator for at least 24 hours.
(One old recipe recommends aging for a fortnight). Two days ought to
suffice. 6. Mix the natural coloring agents, into the aged marzipan.
The stiff confection will be easier to knead if allowed to return to
room temp. 7.  Sculpture the paste according to your wildest fancy.
Wet fingers, preferably in ice water.

Marshmallow Easter Eggs

candy

2  envelopes unflavored gelatin cold w; ater boiling water
2 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1  flour
3/4 lb chocolate for dipping
1  regal icing

Put gelatin in top of double boiler; add cold water. When gelatin
softens, add boiling water and stil well. Add sugar and salt. Put
over boiling water and stir until sugar dissolves completely.

Pour into large bowl of electric mixer and beat at high speed until
misture is thick but not as stiff as beaten egg whites. Add vanilla.

Meanwhile, spread flour 2" deep in a large pan.  Push an egg (in
shell) into the flour  at intervals, making hollow spaces in which to
mold the marshmallow mixture.

Drop marshmallow mixture into the flour molds. Sprinkle flour lightly
over top and put in cold place until set. Remove mixture from one
mold and you have a half-egg. Trim the flat side of marshmallow
half-egg to make it even.  You can dip it in melted chocolate to
cover and decorate with Regal Icing.

Or you can put two halves together to make an egg, as follows: Dip the
rounded part of a half-egg in melted chocolate; set aside to cool,
flat (uncoated) side down. Trim flat side of second half-egg (to make
it even), lift from mold and completely coat with chocolate. Quickly
press its flat side against the flat side of the cooled half-egg and
you have a whole egg. The chocolate will hold it together.

When chocolate-coated eggs are cool, trim with Regal Icing put
through cake decorator tube.  Make ruffles around them to cover seam
where the two halves join and to provide decoration. Write names of
children on their eggs with the icing, or decorate with tiny designs
pressed through fine tips of a cake decorator tube. Frosting my be
left white or tinted in pastel colors. Makes 13 eggs (or 26
half-eggs).

Marzipan Fruit

candy, christmas, deserts, holiday

8 oz almond paste
2 1/4 cup confectioner's sugar
1 each egg white; beaten lightly

* Blend the almond paste and sugar together. Add enough egg white to
create the consistency of modeling clay.

BANANA Color the marzipan light yellow and roll it into the banana
shape. Dissolve cocoa in a little water and, with a small paint
brush, streak the fruit with brown lines.

APPLE Color the marzipan light green or green yellow. Shape into apple
shape and make an impression on top with a chopstick. Finish the
apple with a brown stem and a green leaf (made of marzipan)

STRAWBERRY Color the marzipan red and shape it into a strawberry.
Roll the berry in granulated sugar. Make the hull with green marzipan.

ORANGE Make a smooth ball of orange-colored marzipan; then press a
piece of paper towel against the sides to create the texture of
orange skin. Push a whole clove into the stem end of the orange.

This recpie makes one full-sized fruit or eight miniatures. Using
chopsticks or toothpicks help the modeling process. Paste food
coloring is the best, though liquid works o.k.

Minderbinder

beverages

50  cotton balls, plain
1  or
1  cotton wool, 3 by 6 feet
2 lb bittersweet chocolate
1/2 cup liqueur, any favorite [optional]

If starting from cotton wool, divide it into about 50 pieces, making sure
they are well formed, round, and the rough edges have been worked back into
the mass to make a smooth surface.

Melt the chocolate in a double boiler being careful not to get any water in
the chocolate.

In batches of about ten put the balls of cotton on a fine rack or grate.
Sprinkle with the liqueur if you're using it.  [Be careful! Too much will
overpower the other flavors.]

Slowly pour enough chocolate over each ball of cotton to coat it
thoroughly, letting excess drip off. Allow the chocolate coating to cool
before taking the chocolate covered cotton from the rack.

Keep stored in a closed container in a cool place away from light.
Munitions boxes work well for this.

NOTES:

*  Chocolate covered cotton -- This is a recipe I invented after I had
cornered the cotton market and couldn't get rid of the stuff.

While good orlon can be substituted for the cotton, the resulting product
won't have the same flavor or texture as the real thing. Your friends will
be able to tell that you've been skimping. Egyptian cotton works best.
Yield: About fifty servings.

*  As a special cold-weather treat, use wool instead of cotton.

Mom Stern's Noodle Kugel

deserts

6  eggs
1 1/2 cup sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 tablespoon vanilla
4 oz raisins (1 small box)
4  apples
1 lb muller's wide egg noodles (one box)
4 oz butter (1 stick)
1  cinnamon (for top)

Peel the apples and and slice them into small wedges.

Beat the eggs until they are foamy, add the sugar gradually and beat well.

Cook the noodles according to package directions.  Drain.

Melt the butter in a 9x13 metal baking pan.  Swirl it around to coat the
pan, and then pour the excess butter into the egg mixture. Add baking
powder and vanilla to egg mixture, mix well, and then slowly add drained
noodles, apples and raisins. Mix thoroughly until all the noodles have been
coated and look gooey.

Pour the egg/noodle mixture into the metal pan, top with cinnamon if you
desire, and bake at 425 degrees F. for about 45 minutes to an hour, or
until the top looks a little brown and crispy. The kugel should feel
springy to the touch and not be "wet." Let cool, cut into squares and
serve.

NOTES:

*  Egg noodles, raisins, cinnamon and apples.  Yield:  Serves 12.

*  This feeds about 12 very hungry people (knoshers, as we call them) or 16
normal ones.  What you don't eat right away you can wrap in aluminum foil
and freeze for a month or two. If it's too sweet for your taste, you can
use peaches or other fruit instead of the raisins.

*  Warning:  this stuff sits very heavy in the ol' stomach, so don't try to
eat more than 2 pieces in a 24-hour period.

*  Don't thank me, thank my mom.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking, 1/2 hour cooling.

Nainaimo Bars Ii

appetizers, beverages, eggs, fruits, fruits/nuts
nuts, pork, spreads

      ----CRUST----
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup sugar, granulated
5 tablespoon cocoa
1  egg
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 2/3 cup graham wafer crumbs, fine
1 cup coconut, desiccated
1/2 cup walnuts, chopped
      ----CREAMY CENTER----
1/4 cup butter
2 cup icing sugar, sifted
1  egg
      ----CHOCOLATE TOPPING----
4 oz chocolate, semi-sweet
1 tablespoon butter

MAKE CRUST:  Grease a 9-inch square cake pan.  In a sauce pan combine the
butter, sugar, cocoa, egg and vanilla.  Cook over medium heat stirring
constantly, until smooth and slightly thickened.  Stir in the remaining
crust ingredients and press into prepared pan.

Make the creamy center:  cream the butter and gradually beat in icing sugar
and egg.  Spread over crumb mixture and chill for about 15 minutes.

Make the chocolate topping:  melt the chocolate and butter together over
hot water or in a microwave, being careful not to burn. Spread on top of
the previous parts. Chill until set. Cut into squares with a sharp knife.

NOTES:

*  No-bake, 3-layer (chocolate covered) bars -- Nanaimo bars are a
traditional Canadian dessert, though nobody is certain where the tradition
came from. Laura Secord is a Canadian candy company; their cook book says
this about the origin of these fattening delicacies:

"A version of these no-bake bars developed in the Canadian kitchens of a
well-known food company, was christened by them Nanaimo bars after the city
of that name on Vancouver Island. Nanaimo (from sne-ny-mo, a local Indian
term for a loose confederation of five bands) started as a Hudson Bay
Trading Post in 1849."

: Difficulty:  Easy.
: Time:  1 hour preparation, several hours chilling.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

candy

1 cup peanut butter
1 cup light corn syrup
1 1/2 cup dry powdered milk
1 1/2 cup sifted confectioners sugar
1 large bowl and a wooden spoon
1  paper plates and pencils

Help the children measure the peanut butter, corn syrup, dry powdered
milk, and confectioners sugar into the large bowl. They can take
turns stirring with the wooden spoon until everything is mixed and a
stiff dough forms.

Give everyone a paper plate and a pencil. Each child should write his
or her name on the bottom of the plate. Make sure they hold their
pencils correctly and use uppercase and lower case letters.

Put a portion of dough on each plate. The children can shape it into
bite-sized balls by pinching off pieces and rolling them between their
hands.

Smaller children who cannot make balls can make snakes. Then they can
cut the snakes into segments (with an adults help) to make bite-sized
pieces.

Leave the peanut butter balls on the children's plates and
refrigerate them until firm, about 1 hour.

Orange Glazed Cranberry Pumpkin Bread

breads, breakfast, deserts, lamb

1 2/3 cup sugar
2 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 can whole berry cranberry sauce
3/4 cup chopped pecans
2/3 cup vegetable oil
4  eggs

Preheat Oven to 350 degrees. Generously grease two (2) 9 1/4" x 5
1/4" x 2" loaf pans. In a large bowl, mix together flour, sugar,
baking soda, pumpkin pie spice, salt and baking powder. I a second
bowl stir together remaining ingredients until well mixed.  Add
pumpkin mixture to flour mixture and stir until all ingredients are
well moistened. Pour batter into loaf pans. Bake 65 minutes or until
breads test done with wooden pick. Cool in pans 10 minutes then
remove to cooling racks. Completely cool breads then drizzle glaze
over top and sides.  Makes 2 loaves. Glaze: In a small bowl, with
fork, mix 1 cup powdered sugar, 1/4 cup undiluted orange juice
concentrate and 1/8 teaspoon allspice, until smooth. Drizzle over the
cooled breads. (To be perfectly accurate I use this orange juice
glaze on many items during the course of 2 weeks, so I use a 6 oz can
of frozen oj concentrate, effectively tripling the recipe. This is a
hint). *use Ocean-Spray 16 oz can, if available.

1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
3 1/4 cup sugar
1  box powdered light fruit pectin
6  sprigs fresh tarragon, optional

Servings: makes 6 - 1/2 pint jars Notes:

Sauterne may be replaced by other white wines in this sweet tart
jelly. The flavor lends itself for use both as a spread on breads and
as a meat glaze. It can also be reheated for use as a dessert sauce
on ice cream, sliced oranges, or berries.

Place orange juice, sauterne, and lemon juice in heavy saucepan. Mix
together 3/4 cup sugar and the powdered light fruit pectin. Add to
wine mixture. Cook over high heat, stirring constantly, until mixture
comes to a hard boil. Stir in remaining sugar. Bring to a rolling
boil, stirring constantly. Boil for 1 minute. Remove from heat and
skim off foam with metal spoon. Immediately pour into hot sterilized
jars, add optional sprigs of tarragon, if desired, and vacuum seal
(hot water bath method, or can be refrigerated up to 6 weeks).

2 minutes longer. Pour the custard into a clean bowl and whisk until
slightly cooled, about 1 minute. Let cool to room temp, whisking
occasionally to prevent a skin forming. Cover and refrigerate for at
least 2 hours. (The custard can be made up to 2 days in advance)
Using a small sharp knife, peel the oranges, making sure to remove
all of the bitter white pith. Working over a bowl, cut between the
membranes to release the segments. You should have 3 cups of orange
sections and juice. (The oranges can be prepared up to 2 days ahead;
cover and refrigerate) Set aside 12 of the Almond Meringues and 1/4
cup of the walnuts for garnish. Cut the cake into 18 3-2-inch pieces.
Spread 1 side of each piece of sponge cake or each ladyfinger with
the raspberry jam. In a deep 4-quart nonreactive serving bowl,
preferably glass, arrange 1/3 of the sponge cake pieces or
ladyfingers in a single layer, jam side up. Sprinkle 2 tb of the
sherry over the cake. Scatter 1/3 of the orange section, with their
juice, on top. Scatter 1/3 of the remaining meringues between the
sponge cake pieces and sprinkle with 1/3 of the remaining walnuts.
Spread 1/3 of the custard evenly on top. Repeat the layering of
sponge cake, sherry, orange sections, meringues, walnuts and custard
2 more times. Cover the trifle and refrigerate overnight. In a large
bowl, whip the cream with the confectioner's sugar and vanilla until
stiff. Spread or pipe the whipped cream over the top of the trifle.
Refrigerate until serving time. (The trifle can be prepared to this
point up to 4 hours ahead.) Just before serving, arrange the reserved
meringues over the top of the trifle and sprinkle the remaining 1/4 c
walnuts on top. Source: Food and Wine November 1992

Oreo Surprise

deserts

1 small (15 oz.) pkg oreo cookies
1 cup (8 oz.) margarine, melted
1 cup (8 oz.) confectioner's sugar
1  8-oz  pkg cream cheese
2 small (8 oz.) tubs cool whip
2 small boxes jello instant chocolate puddi; ng

1. Crush entire package of Oreos to fine consistancy (potato masher
works fine for this). Saving out 1/2 cup of Oreo crumbs for later
use, mix remaining crumbs and melted margarine and press in bottom of
9 X 13 baking pan. Tamp firmly with spoon or spatula. 2. Place in
refrigerator for 5 minutes. 3. In large mixing bowl, combine
confectioner's sugar, cream cheese and one (1) tub of cool whip. Beat
with electric mixer until thoroughly mixed. Note: Items will mix much
more easily if cream cheese and cool whip have been set out at room
temperature ahead of time. 4. Retrieve pan from refrigerator, spread
cream cheese/Cool Whip/sugar mixture evenly over Oreo crust. Spread
carefully, as crust will have tendancy to stick to mixture. Return to
refrigerator. 5. Prepare both boxes of chocolate pudding according to
package directions. Then quickly retrieve pan from refrigerator and
spread over top of previous layer. Return to refrigerator for 5
minutes. 6. Retrieve pan from refrigerator and spread remaining tub
of Cool Whip evenly over pudding layer. 7. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of Oreo
crumbs (set aside earlier) over top of Cool Whip layer. 8.
Refrigerate until served. For best results, make the night before.

Oriental Oranges

deserts

12 large oranges
200 gm sugar (7 oz)
3 tablespoon grand marnier or cointreau
2 tablespoon grenadine syrup

ORANGES A L'ORIENTALE Peel the zest from the oranges in long strips,
taking as little of the pith as possible. Cut the zest into very,
very fine julienne strips. Remove the pith in vertical strips to
expose the flesh of the oranges. Then, holding the oranges over a
strainer with a bowl beneath to catch all the juice, cut each segment
away from the membranes that divide one from another, and from the
central core of pith. Squeeze all the discarded membranes to extract
every drop of juice, if any flesh remains on them, and add it to the
already collected juice. Blanch the julienned zest in bouling water
for 1 minute. Refresh in cold water and drain in a sieve. Put the
sugar into a large, wide saucepan and cook over a moderate, steady
heat until the sugar melts and becomes a light golden color. Add the
collected orange juice and, stirring to mix well, cook until the
liquid has the consistency of a light syrup. Add the julienned zest
to the sysrup, as well as the liqueur and the grenadine syrup. If a
scum forms, remove it with a spoon as if you were making jam. Bring
it briefly to the boil. Add the orange segments and shake the pan
well so that they all absorb the syrup. They should be hot, but they
should not be allowed to cook. Set the pan aside. Add another drop of
liqueur to the pan. SERVING: Arrange the segments on four plates to
look like stars. Coat them with the sysrup and decorate with the
julienned zests. ALTERNATIVELY: Serve the oranges in a fruit dish,
with a selection of some other fruit desserts.

Our Family's Plum Pudding 1992~ I/Ii

british, christmas, deserts, fruits

2 cup currants (1/2 pound) - loosely pack; ed
1 1/2 cup golden and/or muscat raisins - (1/2; pound)
1 1/2 cup candied fruit peels
1/4 cup cognac
2 cup english walnuts (1/2 pound) - finel; y chopped
2 cup good beef suet (1/2 pound) - ground; by butcher
1 cup sifted flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon mace
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 cup blackberry jam or preserves
1 cup brown sugar
5 cup loosely packed fresh bread crumbs -; from homemade-type bread
1/2 cup dry cocktail sherry
6  egg yolks; well beaten
6  egg whites; beaten stiff - but not dr
      ----FOR MOLDS----
3  to 4 tb. soft butter
1  brown sugar or flour
1  candied red cherries (opt.) - for b; ottom of molds
1  additional brandy or other liquor -; for ripening pudding
      ----HARD SAUCE----
1/2 cup butter; softened
2 1/2 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
1 tablespoon brandy
1  few drops cream; if needed
      ----GARNISH----
1  holly sprigs
1  candied fruit or angelica
1  brandy

Combine the dried fruits and peels in a large bowl and sprinkle with
cognac.  Cover and place in the refrigerator overnight (or longer - in
which case you may want to add more cognac).

To the fruits in the large bowl, add nuts and suet. Resift flour with
the baking soda, salt and spices; then sift over the fruit mixture
while tossing and mixing with a wooden spoon to evenly distribute the
dry ingredients.  Stir in jam and brown sugar.

Prepare the bread crumbs (use the food processor, removing crusts
first if they are crusty and hard). Sprinkle bread crumbs into the
sherry, mixing with a fork. Add to the fruit mixture.

Add the beaten egg yolks; mix thoroughly.  Last, fold in beaten egg
whites.

Prepare two pudding molds.  This recipe makes enough for one 2-quart
mold, and the remainder can be steamed in a coffee can - a 26-ounce
can makes a round pudding about 3" tall. (You could make one huge
pudding if you have a container.)

Grease molds with butter and then sprinkle them with sugar or dust
with flour.  Arrange candied cherries in molds, if desired (cherries
should be dusted with flour). Fill 2-quart mold no more than 2/3 full
with batter. Cover pudding mold with its lid, fasten with clamps or
tie on securely.

For the coffee can, cover with its plastic lid, tie it on and wrap
all with aluminum foil.  (The plastic will split.) For a bowl without
a lid, cover the top with layered waxed paper tied down securely,
then do the same with aluminum foil.

To steam the puddings:  Place each pudding in its own steaming
container on a rack placed over gently boiling water (see note).
Cover each kettle with a tight-fitting lid and steam puddings - 7
hours for pudding in a 2-quart mold (6" tall, 7" across the top)
filled 2/3 full; 6 hours for the smaller one.  Check the water level
every hour or so, replenishing with boiling water as needed.

When the pudding has finished steaming, uncover it and let it cool.
Remove the pudding from the mold, if it is metal, and sprinkle 2 tb.
or so of brandy, sherry, rum or fruit juice over the pudding. Wrap it
in clean, unbleached muslin, then wrap it in foil and store it in the
refrigerator to ripen for at least three weeks. Open from time to
time and sprinkle judiciously with more liquor - or add it to the
pudding cloth.

When ready to serve, return to the pudding mold and steam as before
for 1 1/2 hours.

To serve: Place hot pudding on a warmed platter. Place a sprig of
holly in the center and decorate sparingly with candied fruit or
angelica. Carefully warm several tablespoons of brandy, and pour a
bit at the rim of the platter.  Ignite brandy with a long-stemmed
match and carry flaming to the table. Serve with hard sauce and/or
brandy-flavored whipped cream.

Yield: Each pudding serves 10 or more.  Makes 5 pounds of pudding or
more.

Note: The bottom of the pudding mold should be above the gently
boiling water at all times so that the pudding is cooked by steam. It
may take some ingenuity to find a way to raise the pudding above the
water.

Kluger wrote: "I steamed one pudding in a vegetable blancher, placing
my canning funnel upside down in the perforated basket and placing
the pudding mold on top of that. The second 'steamer' was contrived
by placing a flat-bottomed colander upside down in the bottom of a
hot-water-bath kettle. This made a nice platform for the pudding to
stand on - about 2" above the bottom of the pan. Allow ample space
between the pudding and the sides of the kettle so the steam can
circulate."

Note: If you want to freeze one of the puddings, cool it after
steaming. Wrap in moisture-vapor-proof freezer wrap and store at 0 F.
for up to 1 year.  When ready to eat, unwrap and thaw loosely covered
in the refrigerator.  Then return to the pudding mold and steam as
directed above for serving.

To make hard sauce:  Using the small bowl of an electric mixer, beat
the butter until creamy.  Add confectioners' sugar gradually, beating
until mixture is creamy, about 5 minutes. Add the brandy.

Press hard sauce through a pastry bag to form decorative shapes and
decorate them with candied red cherry halves and green fruit peels.
(If the mixture is too soft, place in refrigerator to stiffen.)

Oven-Fried Bananas

bananas, deserts

4  ripe bananas, peeled, halved
2 teaspoon butter (or margarine)

Choose yellow (firm-ripe) bananas.  Cut them in half crosswise. Spray
a small square nonstick cake pan with cooking spray. Preheat oven to
450 degrees.  Put the butter in the pan; place in the hot oven just
long enough for butter to melt.

Place the bananas in the pan and tilt the pan so the bananas roll and
become lightly coated with butter. Place the pan on the bottom oven
shelf and bake only 5 minutes, turning the bananas once, until just
browned. Serve with salt and pepper as a starchy side dish, or
sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar substitute as a dessert.

Pagoda Fruit Crisp

chinese, deserts, fruits

1  wonton wrappers
1  cream, whipped
1  fruit, seasonal, sectioned - skinne; d, and depitted

Fry the wonton skins in the least amount of peanut oil possible.
When done, drain and set aside between paper towels to dry.

Put on skin on the serving plate, and layer seasonal fruits onto
it in any pleasant design you can manage. Add spots of whipping cream
into the design and then put another fried skin onto the fruit but
with its corners offset from that of the first layer.

To achieve a "pagoda" effect make sure the second layer skin is
slightly smaller than that first layer. Also try not to put the fruit
on to cover the entire skin. Leave about a half inch of the edges
clean.

Cover the second layer with fruit and whipped cream and garnish and
serve.

NOTES : Panforte has been made in Italy since the Middle Ages and is
traditionally eaten at Christmas. This cake will keep indefinitely if
wrapped well in foil or waxed paper and kept in an airtight container.

Cook until a small amount dropped in water will form a good firm
ball, one that can be rolled between the fingers. Remove from fire,
reserving 1/2 cup of the hot syrup (which is kept in hot water until
needed) for a few minutes or until it cools a little.  Beat until
creamy, roll in a damp cloth like date loaf and when stiff enough to

Pavlova I

australian, deserts

4  egg whites (at room temperature)
1 cup sugar, castor
1 tablespoon vinegar
1  cornflour

With an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form, then
gradually add the sugar (about 1 t every 30 seconds).  This will take
around 15 minutes. Beat until firm. Add the vinegar. When combined, turn
out onto a flat baking sheet that has been greased and dusted with
cornflour. Shape it so that there will be a hollow in the centre to hold
the fruit.

Cook in a pre-heated, warm oven (350-375 degrees F.) for 10 minutes, then
at 200-250 degrees F. for 40-50 mins.

When cooked, turn the oven off and allow to cool slowly in the oven for at
least an hour, preferably overnight.  Gradual cooling is important. Serve
cold, topped with whipped cream and fresh fruit such as strawberries,
bananas and kiwi fruit.

NOTES:

*  Pavlova (Australian meringue dessert) -- This is a quintessentially
Australian dish.  The legend behind it is that it was created by a chef in
Adelaide after he had seen Anna Pavlova dance, saying that he wanted to
create a dessert that was as light and airy as her dancing.

Australians pride themselves on their ability to cook a good Pavlova. When
important visitors come to an Australian household, they are likely to be
served a Pavlova with plenty of fresh fruit.  There are many variations on
the recipe. This one comes from my friend Janet Wiles. Yield: Serves 6-8.

*  Castor sugar is known in North America as "granulated sugar." Cornflour
is likewise "cornstarch." The higher temperature initially is to form a
crust on the outside of the meringue base, it should be crisp on the
outside, though not browned, and soft inside. It's important that the
beaters and the bowl are really dry and clean. Uneven temperatures will
cause the base to collapse (keep the oven door closed and let it cool
slowly).  Experienced Pavlova cooks claim that electric ovens work best
because they heat more uniformly.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, 1 or more hours cooling.
: Precision:  Measure the ingredients.

Pavlova Ii

australian, deserts

4 large egg whites
1 cup sugar, castor
1 teaspoon cornflour
1 teaspoon vinegar
1 teaspoon vanilla flavour

Preheat oven to 250 degrees F.  With an electric mixer beat the egg whites
until soft peaks form,  then gradually add the sugar.  Beat until firm.

Add the cornflour, vinegar and vanilla.  When combined, turn out onto a
flat tray that has been greased and dusted with cornflour. Try a circular
shape with slightly more mixture at the edges so that it may be served by
placing goodies in its centre depression.

Cook in a pre-heated, cool (250 degrees F.) oven for one hour.  When
cooked, turn the oven off, leave the oven door slightly ajar, and allow to
cool slowly in the oven. This slow cooling works to prevent the loss of too
much height. Serve cold, with whipped cream and fresh fruit pieces,
strawberries and kiwi fruit for example.

NOTES:

*  Australian meringue dessert.

*  Cornflour is known in North America as cornstarch.  Castor sugar is
known there as granulated sugar.

*  Make sure that you start off with a clean bowl and beat the egg whites
well.  A bowl with smooth sides (glass, metal) will help the eggs to whip
up. A plastic bowl with scratches prevents the eggs from attaining a very
light texture. Also ensure that the sugar is fully dissolved before going
on to the next step. I have never had troubles from over-whipping. The
final texture should be meringue on the inside with a thin crust on the
outside.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 hour cooking, 1 hour cooling.
: Precision:  Measure the ingredients.

candy, christmas

2 cup sugar
1 cup light corn syrup; karo
1/4 cup water
1 1/2 cup salted peanuts
4 tablespoon butter or regular margarine
2 tablespoon baking soda
1 teaspoon vanilla

Combine the sugar, corn syrup and water in a heavy 3-quart saucepan.
Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar is

to set, loosen from the baking sheets. Turn the brittle over, then
stretch and pull brittle as thin as possible using two forks. When
completely cooled, break into pieces.

1/2 teaspoon vanilla
4 cup icing sugar
1 cup peanut butter

In a medium mixing bowl, combine cold mashed potatoes with salt and
vanilla. Add icing sugar, one cup at a time, beating after each
addition. At first the mixture will be stiff and hard to handle but
with beating it will become very runny. With the addition of the
fourth cup, the mixture will firm up again. Turn half of the mixture
on to a board that's been lightly dusted with icing; roll into a
rectangle two inches thick. Spread with half of the peanut butter.
Roll up from the short side, jelly-roll fashion. Repeat with rest of
fondant. Refrigerate until firm; slice 1/4 inch thick. Makes 4 dozen
candies. From The Gazette, 91/02/27.

Peanut Butter Tater Candy

candy

1 medium white potato
1 pkg confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup salted peanuts; chopped,  optional
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup smooth peanut butter

Boil potato (with skin on) until done.  Peel; remove any eyes or
spots.
In a mixing bowl, mash the potato thoroughly with a fork or
electric mixer at slow speed.  Add vanilla. Gradually add
confectioners' sugar ((use a fork, as mixture begins to firm) until
it forms a ball. Turn out on a confectioners' sugar covered surface
(instead of flour). Roll the ball out flat and oblong until it is
1/4-inch thick.
Spread peanut butter evenly over the flat surface. Sprinkle the
chopped peanuts evenly over peanut butter (if you opt to use them).
Cut the flat surface in half the short way. Roll jelly-roll fashion,
sealing the edges. (2 rolls.)   Place in refrigerator until chilled
and firm. Slice into 1/3-inch pieces. Keep refrigerated until ready
to serve.

Slowly melt the peanut butter and the Butterscotch chips until creamy.
Remove from heat and stir in cereal so that all pieces are as coated
as desired (If you want it sweeter use less cereal if you want to
stretch it out use more.)

NOTE: Do not use Cholesteral free peanut butter. In order for the
Chips to melt they need the oil of the peanut butter. I found this

Peanut Candy

candy

2 cup shelled peanuts
2 cup granulated sugar

Chop the peanuts fine.  Put the sugar into a skillet and stir
constantly until it is all melted.  Then add the peanuts and pour at
once into a buttered pan. When cold, break into pieces.

The finely chopped peanuts make, of course, a much more uniformly
nutty candy than the usual peanut brittle. The recipe makes about one
pound of candy.

In a heatproof bowl over hot, not simmering water, heat the chocolate
till almost completely melted. Remove from the water and let stand,
stirring occasionally, until the residual heat melts the chocolate
completely. Let the chocolate cool until tepid. Lightly butter a
baking sheet. Stir the marshmallows and peanuts into the tepid
chocolate. (Stir a marshmallow into the chocolate as a temperature
test. If it melts, the chocolate is still too warm; cool longer. If
the chocolate stiffens, heat over hot water until the chocolate is
softened.) Spread onto the prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate until
firm, at least 4 hours. Cut into pieces. (Store the rocky road at
room temperature in an airtight container.) Makes about 1-3/4 pounds.

Pecan Butter Crunch - (Heath Bar)

candy

3 cup pecans; finely chopped 3/4 lb
1/2 lb butter; unsalted, grade aa land '
1 cup granlated sugar
1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
1  salt; pinch
10 oz milk chocolate bars
8 oz bakers german's dark sweet chocolat; e

Preheat oven to 300. This recipe requires a candy thermometer.
Although somewhat expensive to make, butter crunch goes far, and can
be used for a large number of gifts. It keeps and travels well, and
can be made up to two months in advance. Line large pan (such as 15 x
10 x 1 1/2-inch jelly roll pan) with aluminum Foil. Set aside. Divide
pecans between two small baking pans (such as 9-inch cake pans),
evenly spreading 1 1/2 cups in each. Bake until golden (about 15
minutes). Turn off oven, but leave pans inside to keep nuts warm. Put
butter in heavy 2-quart saucepan. Cook over low heat until melted.
Stir in sugar, water, and corn syrup. Increase flame to medium-high.
Cook, stirring constantly with wooden spoon, until sugar has
dissolved and mixture comes to a boil (4 - 5 minutes). Insert candy
thermometer. Continue boiling at moderate,s teady rate, stirring
almost constantly, until thermometer reaches 300 degrees F. (hard
crack stage). (Total cooking time will be approximately 20 minutes.)
IMMEDIATELY turn off flame under pot. QUICKLY stir in salt and 1 1/2
cups (contents of one pan) pecans. Pour into foil-lined pan, using
wooden spoon to spread mixture to edges. In top of double boiler
(over simmering water), melt chocolate. Turn off flame. Quickly
spread one-half of the melted chocolate over the cooled toffee.
Evenly sprinkle with one-half of the remaining pecans. Pat down with
spatula. Cover pan with waxed paper. Top with inverted cookie sheet.
Carefully invert. Peel off foil. Spread toffee with remaining melted
chocolate. Sprinkle with remaining nuts. Pat down with spatula.
Refrigerate until firm. Break into bite-sized pieces. Store in
airtight container. (It will remain fresh for at least two months.)

Pecan Penuche

candy

2 cup dark brown sugar; firm pack
3/4 cup milk
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 tablespoon butter; in small pieces
1 teaspoon vanilla
3/4 cup pecans; chopped

Oil a jelly-roll pan or an 8 X 8-inch pan.  Combine the sugar, milk
and salt in a heavy 3-quart pot, stirring to mix well. Place over
medium heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly, until the sugar
dissolves. Cove and let boil for 2 to 3 minutes.
Uncover and wash down the sides of the pot with a pastry brush
dipped in cold water.  Continue to boil, over medium heat, to the
firm ball stage (240-250 degrees F.), stirring only if it starts to
burn.
Remove from the heat and immediately place the pot in a larger pot
filled with cold water; this will stop the cooking process and bring
the temperature down.
Drop in the butter and let cool slightly, without stirring. beat
until it starts to thicken, add the vanilla and the pecans and
continue to beat until the candy loses some of its gloss. Spread
evenly in the pan and mark into squares.  When firm, cut into pieces
and store in an airtight container. From Fannie Farmer's New Cookbook

Pecan Pralines

candy, southwest

1 cup milk
1 cup sugar, granulated
1 cup dark brown sugar, firmly packed
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 tablespoon corn syrup, dark
8 oz pecan halves
3/4 cup water, boiling
24  cupcake papers

Place the white sugar, brown sugar, milk and corn syrup in a heavy
about 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir to thoroughly
dissolve.

Measuring the temperature with a candy thermometer, stir constantly
with a long-handled wooden spoon. When the mixture reaches "jelly"
temperature on the thermometer (220 degrees), it will bubble
furiously. Splattering is a danger (this is why you want a spoon with
a long handle). You may wish to wear heavy rubber gloves for further
protection. Continue stirring until mixture reaches 256 degrees
("medium-ball" stage).

Remove from heat, add vanilla and let it sit for 10 minutes. During
this time, set out the cupcake papers on the countertop and place 3-4
pecan halves in each paper.

Beat the mixture by hand with the wooden spoon, while it is still in
the pan, until it loses its glossy sheen. This can take up to 10
minutes or more, and calls for a strong arm.

At this point, the mixture will very quickly begin to form lumps and
harden in the pan. As this begins to happen, return the pan to low
heat; add boiling hot water a tablespoon at a time, and beat out the
lumps until nearly all are gone. Add just enough water so that the
mixture is somewhat runny and has lost much of its previous lumpy
consistency (no more than about
3/4 cup of water, and often much less.) Leaving a few lumps is
permissible and often unavoidable.

Remove from heat and spoon it into the cupcake papers. Let it harden
for 20-30 minutes, then remove papers. Be sure not to let the papers
remain on after the candy has hardened somewhat or they will be
difficult to remove later.

Store the pralines in an airtight container.

NOTES:

*   Texas-style creamy pecan cookies -- My family is from Texas, and
we dearly love "authentic" Mexican food. Authentic as defined by my
father: home-style Tex-Mex. (On a trip to Acapulco, he complained
that he couldn't find any real Mexican food in the whole damn town.)

We feel that the perfect ending to an orgy of tacos, enchiladas,
tamales, beans, rice and Dos Equis beer is pralines. However, we have
been consistently disappointed by the pralines served at restaurants.
They are always either crystalline and crunchy, or sticky like
undercooked taffy. Both are equally unacceptable.

At the age of 10, I decided to try my hand at making pralines, and
happened on a recipe in a current (1958) issue of _The Ladies Home
Journal_, which I accidently adapted to make the perfect praline, not
gooey, not crunchy, but of a solid consistency that becomes creamy in
texture as it is eaten. The secret is to first screw up the recipe
(at this point you are tempted to throw the whole thing out,
including the pot) and then rectify the mistake into a wonderfully
sinful sugary concoction. Now, no Mexican dinner or Christmas candy
plate at our house is complete without them. Yield: Makes 16-24.

: Difficulty:  moderate to hard.
: Time:  30 minutes cooking, 30 minutes cooling.
: Precision:  Measure the ingredients and the temperatures.

Pecan Pralines - Dupree

2 cup sugar
1/2 cup light corn syrup
1/2 cup water
2 cup pecan halves
1/4 cup butter
1 tablespoon vanilla

Heat the sugar, syrup, water, and pecans in a heavy saucepan until the
sugar is disolved.  Bring the mixture to the boil, stirring
occasionally, until it reaches the soft ball stage (240F). Remove the
saucepan from the heat and add butter and vanilla.
Allow candy to cool.  Whip until the mixture gradually changes to
an opaque color and becomes creamy. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto a
buttered cookie sheet and allow to harden. Makes two dozen. From
Nathalie Dupree's New Southern Cooking Nathalie Dupree writes,
"Pralines are traditionally given as Christmas gifts.  Their
sweetness will linger in your mouth long after the candy is gone."

Pecan Pralines - Patout

cajun, candy

2 cup heavy cream
4 cup raw or brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 cup pecan halves
2 tablespoon butter

Alex Patout swears his recipe makes "The creamiest pralines anywhere"
Butter a medium saucepan--this will make it easier to clean later.
Pour in the cream and place over high heat. When it begins to boil,
add the sugar and stir rapidly until it dissolves.  Then stir in the
vanilla and pecans and continue to cook over medium heat, stirring
frequently, until the mixture reaches the soft-ball stage (236F on
the candy thermometer). Remove from heat and quickly beat in the
butter--this helps arrest the cooking process.  The candy should lose
its glossy color and become very cloudy. Lay out a long strip of
waxed paper on a work surface. Moisten it with a damp towel.  Drop
good-sized spoonfuls of the hot praline mixture onto the waxed paper,
stirring the mixture occasionally as you go along to keep it well
combined.  Remove the pralines from the paper before they have cooled
completely--later on it will be hard to remove them without breaking
them. Store in tightly sealed containers, with layers of waxed paper
in between. Makes about 2 dozen From Alex Patout's Cajun home Cooking

Pecan Pralines - Prudhomme

cajun, candy

1 1/2  sticks unsalted butter
1 cup sugar
1 cup packed, light brown sugar
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 cup milk
1 cup chopped pecans
2 cup pecan halves
2 tablespoon vanilla extract

NOTE: To judge doneness, use one or more of the following guides; 1.
Candy thermometer will read 240F 2. When done, the batter will begin
forming distinct threads on the sides or bottom of the pan. 3. Near
the end of the cooking time, make a test praline every few seconds.
The early-test pralines will be somewhat runny, very shiny and
somewhat translucent. The ideal praline will have progressed past
that stage--it will not be runny and will be less shiny; when cooled
it will be opaque, lusteriess and crumbly instead of chewy. 4.  Near
the end of the cooking time, drizzle spoonfuls of the mixture across
the surface of the mixture. When ready, the mixture will form a neat
thread across the surface.
Assemble all ingredients and utensils before starting to cook. You
will need a large heavy bottomed aluminum pot or skillet with deep
sides, a long handled metal whisk or spoon, 2 large spoons (or an ice
cream scoop with a manual release) and a lightly buttered cookie
sheet. Be careful not to get any of the mixture on you skin, as it
sticks and can cause serious burns. Melt the butter in the pot over
high heat. As soon as it's melted, add the sugars and cream.  Cook 1
minute, whisking constantly.
Add the milk and chopped pecans,  cook 4 minutes more, whisking
constantly.  Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking and whisking 5
minutes.  Add the pecan halves and vanilla and continue whisking and
cooking until done, about 15 to 20 minutes longer (see NOTE above on
tests for doneness).  If mixture starts to smoke toward end of
cooking, lower the heat.
Remove pan from heat.  Quickly and carefully drop the batter onto
the cookie sheet by heaping spoonfuls, using the second spoon to
scoop the batter off the first (or use ice cream scoop). Each praline
should form a 2-inch patty about 1/2 inch thick.  Cool and store in
an airtight container, or wrap each praline in plastic wrap or foil.
LAGNIAPPE: To clean the pot and utensils, boil water in the pot with
the utensils in it. This will melt the batter off. From Paul

Pecan Pralines-<Prah-Leens>

cajun, candy, nuts

1/2 cup evaporated milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
2 tablespoon butter
1 cup pecans

The quintessential New Orleans candy. And it's pronounced
<PRAH-leens> or <PRAW-leens>, NOT <PRAY-leens>. I've had ferners
(that's Yatspeak for "non-New Orleanian") stand before me and insist
that it's pronounced <PRAY-leens>. Well bra, I'm from The City where
they were invented, and I know how to pronounce it. And you're
certainly entitled to your opinion on its pronunciation, no matter
how wrong it may be ...

Combine the sugar and milk and cook slowly in a heavy pot over a low
flame until it reaches the soft ball stage (238 degrees on a candy
thermometer). Remove from heat and add the butter, vanilla and
pecans. Beat mixture with a wooden spoon until it is smooth and
creamy. Drop by spoonsful onto waxed paper. If the candy does not
harden within 10 minutes, it may be cooked some more.  Walt MM

Pecan Rocca

candy

1 cup pecans, chopped (we use chopped alm; onds on some batches)
3/4 cup brown sugar (packed)
1/2 cup butter or margarine (butter makes i; t richer)
1/2 pkg (6 oz size) semisweet chocolate chi; ps. (1/2 cup)

Almond Rocca: This is not for Almond Roca, yet it is close enough and
it is real easy. In fact my 14 year old daughter has been making it
by herself at Christmas for the past 4 years. Hope this will meet
your needs. It comes from the Betty Crocker cookbook, so you may have
it on hand already.

Toffee: Butter square pan, 9x9x2 inches. Spread chopped nuts in pan.
Heat sugar and butter to boiling, stirring constantly. Boil over
medium heat, stirring constantly, 7 minutes (watch it real close the
last minute or two).  Immediately spread mixture evenly over nuts in
pan. Sprinkle chocolate pieces over hot mixture; place a baking sheet
over pan so contained heat will melt chocolate. Spread melted
chocolate over canndy. While hot, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares. chill
until firm.

Now for the changes we use.

When we are going to be giving this as a gift, we melt another 1/2
cup of chocolate in the microwave.  Use an 7x7x2 pan (or smaller than
the 9x9x2). Spread the melted chocolate on top of the buttered pan
that is covered with the nuts.  After the chocolate is spread on top,
sprinkle more nuts on top, while chocolate is still warm. Then cut
into small sizes. After the candy is set, remove from the pan and
wrap individually with desert foil. I get mine at the bakery supply,
or a craft shop.

Perfect Sweet Tart And Tartlet Crust

eggs, spices, spreads

14 tablespoon butter; unsalted (1 3/4 sticks)
2 1/3 cup flour
1  pinch salt
3 tablespoon sugar
2  egg yolks beaten =with=
4 tablespoon ice water - to 5 t

In the food processor, cut the butter into the flour.  Add the salt
and sugar.  Do not overwork.  Little by little add the egg yolks and
water. Process 15 to 20 seconds.  Turn p[astry onto a floured board,
and blend the pastry by pressing it into a ball and then kneading it
quickly with the heel of your hand until no lumps remain.  As with
all pastry, work as quickly as possible, and use as little additional
flour as possible to avoid toughening the dough.

Chill dough at least 20 minutes.

After chilling, roll 1/8 inch thick and cut into shapes slightly
larger than the tart or tartlet pans.  Press pastry into the tartlet
(or tart) pans and cut off excess with your thumb.  Chill in pans
before baking. Any unused pastry can be tightly wrapped and chilled
or frozen for future use.

To bake:  Use foil and weight down with beans or use other tart tins
to line the tart. Preheat oven to 375^.  Bake the shells for 15 to 17
(??) minutes. When they seem to be coloring slightly around the
edges, remove the top pans and return pastry to oven to dry out.  Do
not brown.  Cool the shells on racks.  If not to be used immediately,
store in a tightly covered plastic container in the freezer.

Thaw before using.

Makes one 10-inch tart; two 9-inch tarts; or twelve 3-inch tartlets.
Can also use small muffin tins for appetizers. It's about the right
size for the Chocolate Victoria's.

Note:  Watch that you don't add too much water, particularly if not
made with a food processor.

Pineapple Pudding

deserts

4 oz butter (not margarine)
3/4 cup sugar
4  eggs
1 can crushed pineapple
4  pieces of bread, cubed, crusts incl; uded

Cream room-temp butter and sugar together--this can be done right in
the casserole dish it will be baked in. Beat in eggs, one at at a
time. Stir in the crushed pineapple (make sure you drain it very
well). Fold in the cubed bread--I use white but I guess you can use
whatever. Bake at 350 degrees F for about 45 minutes--the edges will
turn golden brown and it will get all bubbly. Serve warm, as a
sidedish with your meal. It could be used as a dessert, but we
usually indulge with our main meal)

You can cut down on the amount of butter if you want--I usually only
use 3/4 of a stick.  Leftovers heat up very well, too. Enjoy!

1  mint sprigs (opt)
1  strawberry sauce

1. In a 1 1/2 to 2 quart pan, mix 1/3 cup sugar, yolks, and 3/4 cup
coconut milk. Stir over medium-low heat until mixture thickly coats a
metal spoon, about 10 minutes; do not boil. Stir in rum. Let cool. If

round; trim edges to neaten. Set rounds slightly apart on 2 baking
sheets, each 12x15" Bake in a 400'F. oven until golden and crisp,

pastries on racks. If made ahead, store airtight up to
1    day.

3. Halve pineapples lengthwise; core. Slice crosswise 1/4" thick.
Place 1/2 the pineapple on each baking sheet. Place 1 pan about 3"
below broiler. When tinged brown, about 10 minues, turn pineapple
over and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar. Broil until brown, about 6
minutes. Repeat to broil remaining fruit. If made ahead, let stand up
to 2 hours.

4. To present, put 1/2 or 1 pastry (break large bubbles to flatten)
on each dinner plate. Fan pineapple equally on pastries; pour coconut
sauce around desserts. Spoon dots of strawberry sauce onto coconut
sauce. Garnish with mint.

Pineapple-Mint Sorbet

deserts, fruits/nuts

      ----FOR THE SORBET----
1/4 cup sugar
1 cup water
2 cup strained fresh orange juice, from a; bout 2 lb oranges
1  juice of 1 large lime
1  ripe pineapple, peeled, cored, coar; sely chopped
3 teaspoon chopped fresh mint leaves
      ----PINEAPPLEMINT GARNISH----
1/2  ripe pineapple, peeled, cored, fine; ly chopped
1/4 cup cointreau (optional)
2 tablespoon chopped fresh mint leaves

To make the sorbet:  Combine the sugar and water ina large saucepan
and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Meanwhile, combine the orange
and lime juices. Puree the pineapple in a food processor fitted with
a steel blade or blender along with the mint leaves. Use some of the
orange juice to moisten. Combine with the orange-lime juice. Stir the
pineapple mixture into the cooled syrup.  Either freeze in an ice
cream freezer or freeze in a covered bowl.  When frozen solid, remove
from the bowl and spoon into a food processor fitted with the steel
blade. Process until fluffy; this breaks up the ice crystals and
results in a smoother texture. To ensure this very smooth texture,
repeat the process one more time after a couple of hours (this step
is optional). Spoon into individual serving dishes, cover with
plastic and then foil, and freeze. Or oil a loaf pan or mold and line
with plastic wrap. Pour in the sorbet mixture, cover tightly with
plastic wrap and then foil, and freeze. Work quickly so that the
sorbet doesn't melt, or ice crystals will form again when it freezes.
To make the garnish and serve:  Toss together the chopped pineapple
and the Cointreau if you using it.  Add the mint leaves. Set aside or
refrigerate until ready to serve. Twenty minutes before serving,
place the sorbet in the refrigerator to soften. If you froze it in
the loaf pan, unmold on a platter.  Cut slices using sharp knife. IF
you froze it in individual molds, unmold into bowls. Serve, topping
each serving with the garnish. Advance preparation:  This sorbet will
hold for weeks, covered tightly, in the freezer.  The garnish can be
made several hours ahead of serving time and held in a covered bowl
in the refrigerator. Calories: 86. Fat: .40 g. Sodium 1 mg. Protein 1

Pink Grapefruit Honey Sorbet

deserts

1/2 gal pink or ruby red grapefruit juice
2 tablespoon honey
1/2 cup triple sec liqueur
8  sprigs of fresh mint for garnish

With an ice cream maker: 1. Combine juice, honey and liqueur and
chill. 2. Following the instructions of your ice cream machine,
process the juice mixture until thick and frozen. 3. Scoop sorbet
into chilled stem glasses and serve garnished with a sprig of mint.

Without an ice cream maker: 1. Combine juice, honey and liqueur as in
the recipe above. 2. Pour the liquid sorbet mixture into a 9-inch by
13-inch cake pan. Freeze. 3. When frozen, shave the now solid mixture
with a metal spatula. Place shavings in serving glasses and serve
immediately. 4. You may instead break the frozen sorbet into pieces
that will fit a food processor. Using the on and off button, process
the sorbet until it is very coarsely granulated. Serve immediately.

Notes: For best results use Ruby Red grapefruits. They are sweeter and
color the sorbet a gorgeous pink.

Pirao De Arroz Com Leite De Coco

brazil, deserts

4 cup coconut milk made with 2 fresh coco; nuts and 4 cups
1  milk
3/4 cup rice flour
1 teaspoon salt

In a heavy 2- to 3-qt sauce pan, scald 3 cups of the coconut milk by
warming it over moderate heat until tiny bubbles form around the edge
of the pan.  Combine the remaining 1 cup of coconut milk with the
rice flour and salt in a small bowl and, stirring constantly, pour it
gradually into the scalded milk. Reduce the heat to low and cook,
stirring, until the mixture is thick and smooth.

Pour the pudding into a lightly buttered or oiled 1-quart metal or
porcelain mold or into 6 individual 6- to 8-oz custard molds and cool
it to room temperature. Then refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or
until the pudding is firm.

The pudding may be served directly from the mold(s) in which it
chilled, or it may be unmolded in the following fashion: Run a thin,
sharp knife around the inside edge of the mold and dip the bottom of
the mold in hot water for a few seconds.  Place an inverted plate
over the top of the mold and, grasping the plate and mold firmly
together in both hands, quickly turn them upside down. Rap the plate
sharply on the table. The pudding should slip out of the mold easily.
If it doesn't repeat the whole process.

Poached Pears With Pepper

deserts, fruits

6 small firm-ripe pears; abt. 2 lbs. - preferably
750 ml bottle dry red wine
1/3 cup sugar
2 teaspoon black or white peppercorns
1/2 pint whipping cream

Pare the pears, leaving stems intact.  With paring knife or vegetable
peeler, remove as much of the cores as possible from the blossom ends.

Place wine and sugar in a non-corrodible pan just large enough to
hold the pears.  Cook, stirring occasionally, over high heat until
sugar is just dissolved.  Reduce heat to medium and add pears and
peppercorns.

Simmer pears, turning them occasionally, until they are tender, about
25 minutes.  Remove from heat and let them cool to room temperature,
then transfer the pears to a serving dish. Strain poaching liquid and
boil until it is reduced by half.  Cool to room temperature.

Whip the cream to soft peaks, with a little sugar if desired. Chill
the cream for a few minutes or as long as 2 hours. Pour poaching
liquid over pears and serve the whipped cream on the side.

2  earl grey tea bags
3/4 cup sugar
1  juice of 1 lemon
6  plums

1. Bring 6 C of water to a boil in a large nonreactive saucepan. Add
tea bags, remove from heat, cover, and steep for about 10 minutes.
Remove tea bags and bring back to a boil. Add sugar and lemon juice
and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes.

2. Reduce heat to medium low so that liquid is barely simmering. Add
plums and poach until tender, 30 seconds to 1 minute. (If plums are
not very ripe, this will take longer.) Remove plums from liquid and
let cool. Reduce poaching liquid to the consistency of light syrup.
For an elegant presentation, Pull plum skin back from fruit, leaving
it attached at the stem end (this doesn't work on all plum
varieties). Serve plums with some of the poaching liquid.

Poor Knights - Heirloom Recipe From 1300's Br

breads, british, deserts, heirloom

4  thick slices of bread
2  eggs beaten
200 ml white wine [or milk]
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 1/4 tablespoon sugar
1  oil for frying
1  confectioners sugar to serve
1  cinnamon to serve

This dish originated during the middle ages in England and spread all
over the world with many variations. Traditionalists should use
bread, but stale cake is a good substitute. Red wine can be used
instead of white. Substitute milk for wine and you have a more
recognizable dish called, incorrectly, french toast.

Bread: Cut off crusts and cut into quarters. Place in a deep dish.
Mix eggs with wine, cinnamon, and sugar in a bowl. Pour, once mixed,
over the bread and leave to soak for 3 minutes. Heat the oil [1/4
inch deep]. Drain the bread and slide it into the hot oil {Watch your
hands as it 'spits'}. Fry until golden brown on both sides Drain on
absorbent kitchen paper. Sprinkle with confectioners sugar and ground
cinnamon. From Ron's Plaice in Blackpool:) Feb 1996.

until mixture is crumbly.  Combine the egg, lemon juice and water to
add to the flour mixture. Knead lightly into a ball; divide into 8
parts. Roll out each part on a floured board until it is 1/4 inch
thick, then cut into 4 inch square.  Spoon about 1 teaspoon Poppy
Seed Filling into the center of each square.  Bring two ends together
to form a cylinder. Pinch together to seal.  Place on a greased
baking sheet and brush with milk. Bake at 350 F for 15-20 minutes.

FILLING: Combine all ingredients in a saucepan; cook over low heat
until thick, stirring often.  Cool and it's ready to use.

NOTE: Any cooked fruit or jam may be used instead of Poppy Seed
Filling.

Portokalia Se Mavrothaphne - Oranges In Red W

deserts, fruits

1  karen mintzias
8  navel oranges
1/2 cup sugar
2 cup mavrodaphne or ruby port
1  bay leaf
1  clove

Remove the zest of 2 of the oranges with a zester; or pare finely
with a vegetable peeler, then cut into thin julienne strips. With a
very sharp knife, cut off the skin and outside membrane of all the
oranges, so you have glistening orbs of golden pulp.  Do this over a
bowl to catch escaping juice.

Choose a saucepan just large enough to hold 2 oranges at a time and
put in the escaped juice and remaining ingredients. Dissolve the
sugar and simmer for 5 minutes. Submerge 2 oranges at a time and cook
just long enough to warm them through - about 3 minutes. If they bob
up, place a small weighted saucer over them. Remove to a serving dish
and continue with the next pair until finished.

Boil to reduce the syrup by half, drizzle over the oranges, and chill.

In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. In another bowl,
cream shortening with remaining 1/2 cup sugar until fluffy. Beat in

well after each addition and finishing with dry ingredients.
Pour batter over fruit in pan and bake in a preheated 350F oven for

1 cup brown sugar
2 tablespoon milk
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup raisins
1  pastry recipe

Combine the dry ingredients. Cut in the shortening. Add the water a
little bit at a time, adding just enough to bind it together without
overmixing it. Handle it as little as possible. Roll it out, and use
a a round cookie cutter to cut the circles, matching the size to your
muffin tins. Using your fingers, pleat them to fit in the muffin tin.
When you look straight down at the tin, it will look like a flower
with four petals. Cover the raisins with water and heat to the
boiling point. Let them sit a minute or two to fluff up and then
drain. Combine remaining ingredients in a separate bowl. Divide your
raisins equally between your tart shells. Pour filling over raisins,
filling each tin 2/3 full. Bake at 450 degrees for 8 minutes, then at
350 degrees for 5 - 10 minutes, until golden brown. Let cool and

Profiteroles

deserts

2 tablespoon butter
1/2 lb semisweet chocolate
1 cup water
2 tablespoon corn syrup
2/3 cup heavy cream
1  pate a choux
3/4 cup water
1/4 lb butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup flour
5  eggs
1  sweetened whipped cream
1 1/2 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoon sugar
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

CHOCOLATE SAUCE

PREPARATION: For the Chocolate Sauce, chop the butter and chocolate
into small pieces. Put the butter, chocoalte, water, and corn syrup
in the top of a double boiler set over hot (not boiling) water. Stir
occasionally until the chocolate is just melted. Remove from hot
water and whisk in the cream.

Chocolate Sauce can be made several days ahead.

Line 2 baking pans with parchment paper or butter them and dust with
flour.

For the Pate a Choux, put the water, butter, and salt in a heavy
saucepan over medium heat and bring just to a boil. Remove from heat.
Add the flour and beat to combine. Return to medium-low heat,
stirring constantly and vigerously, until the paste forms a ball and
leaves a thin film on the bottom of the pan, about 5 minutes. Remove
from heat and let cool a moment. Add 4 of the eggs, one at a time,
beating thoroughly after each addition.

Heat oven to 425F.  Beat the remaining egg with 1 tablespoon of water
to make an egg wash.  Put the Pate a Choux in a pastry bag fitted
with a 1/2-inch plain tip. Pipe 1-inch mounds onto the prepared pans,
spacing them about 1 inch apart.  (Or use 2 spoons to form the
mounds.) Lightly brush the tops with the egg wash and bake in
preheated oven for 10 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 350 F and
bake until lightly browned and all beads of moisture on the tops have
evaporated, about 8 minutes longer. Cool on a rack in a dry place.

Recipe can be made to this point a few hours ahead.

Whip the heavy cream with the sugar and vanilla until just stiff. The
cream can be whipped an hour ahead.

SERVING;  Bring the chocolate sauce back to room temperature if
refrigerated.  Put the whipped cream into a pastry bag fitted with a
1/2 inch fluted tip. Cut the tops off the pastry puffs using a
serrated or sharp paring knife.  Pipe or spoon in the whipped cream.
Replace the tops. Pour some chocolate sauce onto each plate. Put the
cream puffs on top of the sauce and serve at once.

Pumpkin Bread Pudding

breads, deserts, fruits, puddings

4  eggs
3 cup whole milk
1 lb mashed pumpkin
1 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 1/2 quart torn bread pieces
1 cup dark raisins
1  boubon sauce:
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1  egg
1 cup sugar
2 tablespoon whole milk
1/2 cup bourbon

PUDDING: Beat eggs in a large bowl. Add milk and beat again. Stir in
pumpkin, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and vanilla. Add bread pieces
and press with your hands to submerge bread in the milk mixture. (If
you have the time, cover and refrigerate the mixture several hours or
overnight; break up the bread the next day and bake as directed; if
not, proceed as follows.) Set the mixture aside for 15 minutes. Use
your fingers to break up the chunks of bread. Set aside 15 minutes
and repeat. Add raisins. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Generously butter
a 2 quart baking dish. Fill the dish with bread pudding mixture and
bake for 1 hour, or until pudding is set. Serve warm, hot or cold
with hot bourbon sauce. BOUBON SAUCE: Use unsalted real butter for
the best bourbon sauce; margerine doesn't make a great sauce. Melt
butter in a bowl set over hot but not boiling water. Combine egg,
sugar and milk in a small bowl and beat until light colored. Add to
butter and beat with a whisk over hot water until sugar dissolves -
at least 5 minutes. Add boubon and stir. Remove from stove and serve.

Pumpkin Flan

deserts, holiday

1  ingredients:
1 cup pumpkin
1/4 cup honey
3/4 teaspoon cinnamon
5  eggs
1 can (13 oz.) carnation evaporated milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon brandy (or asbach-uralt), optional
1/4 cup brown sugar, packed

(TIP:) Six individual custard cups can be used as well as the form in
the main recipe section.   Bake them at 325 degrees for 45 minutes,
and test with a knife at the edge of the custard. The center will
continue to cook when  removed  from the oven because of the small
size. Cover and chill. For a pumpkin flan "brulee" sprinkle the brown
sugar over the BAKED custard (rather than in the bottom of the cup)
and broil 4 inches from the heat until the  sugar bubbles, watching
every second....it burns *very* easily. When the sugar bubbles,
remove it immediately, cover and chill.

Combine  the pumpkin,  honey and cinnamon.   Beat the eggs. Add milk,
vanilla and pumpkin mixture to the eggs. Stir in the brandy, mixing
well.

Sprinkle  the  brown sugar over the BOTTOM of a buttered 10-inch
baking dish.  S-l-o-w-l-y  pour in the custard mixture and place the
baking dish in a pan of hot water. Bake (together with the pan of hot
water) at 350 degrees for one hour, or until the custard is set.
Insert a knife into the custard.  If it comes out clean, the custard
is done. Cover and chill for 2 to 4 hours before serving.

Purim Manicotti

deserts, holiday, italian

2  eggs salt
1 1/2 cup flour; unbleached
1 cup oil; for frying,olive or other
1 1/2 cup honey

Lightly beat eggs and salt together. Gradually add 1 1/4 to 1 1/2
cups of flour and mix until a rather soft dough is formed. Knead for
1 minute, then roll out as thin as you can. With a pizza cutter or
with a very sharp knife, make 24 2"x6" strips. Heat the oil in a
small frying pan until a piece of dough dropped into it sizzles
immediately. Holding one strip of dough at one end with your hand,
plunge the other end of the strip into the hot oil 1 inch deep. At
once insert the frying part of the strip between the prongs of the
fork with your other hand. Roll the fork in a counterclockwise motion
while letting the rest of the strip slide into the oil. The strip
will fry while it is rolling around the fork. When the manicotto is
golden, hold it above the pan a few seconds to drip, then gently
place on a paper towel. Repeat until all the manicotti are done. Heat
half the honey in a small saucepan. As it starts to boil, drop 2 to 3
manicotti in it for a few seconds to be coated with honey. Lower the
heat and continue to dip the manicotti in the hot honey sauce until
all have been coated, gradually adding additional honey. Cool
thoroughly before serving. YIELDS: 24

Putitza

deserts, holiday, italian

      ----FOR THE DOUGH----
1 pkg active dry yeast
1 1/3 cup warm milk
3 3/4 cup flour
1/2 cup sugar
3  eggs
6 tablespoon butter; melted
1  lemon; grated peel only
1 pinch salt
      ----FOR THE FILLING----
2 oz golden raisins
2 tablespoon breadcrumbs
4 tablespoon butter
4 oz walnut meats
1 oz blanched almonds
1 oz candied citron
1 oz candied orange peel
2 oz pine nuts
1  lemon; grated peel only
1  orange; grated peel only
2  egg yolks
1  egg white
1  granulated sugar

One of Italy's very special Christmas and New Year's dishes is this
rich nut-and-fruit pastry, sometimes spelled "Putitza" or "Putizza."
DISSOLVE THE YEAST in 1/4 cup milk. Add 1/2 cup flour and knead into
a soft ball. Cover this with a towel and let it rise in a warm place.
When it has doubled in bulk, add it to a bowl containing the rest of
the flour, the sugar, eggs, melted butter, pinch of salt and grated
lemon peel. Mix in enough milk to make a supple dough; knead well.
Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled in bulk. Put the
raisins in a small bowl and cover with hot water; let soften, then
drain. Saute breadcrumbs in 3 tablespoons butter. Finely chop
walnuts, almonds and candied fruits. In a large bowl, mix together
the raisins, pignoli, grated lemon and orange peel, chopped nuts and
fruits, sauteed breadcrumbs and 1 egg yolk. Whip the egg white into
soft peaks and fold it into the mixture. Preheat oven to 375F. Butter
a baking sheet. Roll dough into a sheet 1/8-inch thick. Spread
filling over it, leaving 1 inch clear at the edges. Roll it into a
cylinder and coil it on the baking sheet like a snail shell. Beat the
remaining egg yolk in a small bowl and paint the surface of the dough
with it. Sprinkle it with sugar and bake 35 to 40 minutes, or until
pastry is firm and golden brown. Makes 1 Loaf

5 tablespoon espresso coffee or double-strength; coffee at room temp.
3 tablespoon powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 tablespoon creme de cacao, kahlua or tia maria
1  chocolate glaze (recipe follows)
6 large eggs, separated, at room temperatur; e
1  chocolate glaze
4 tablespoon unsalted butter
3 tablespoon light corn syrup
4 oz semi-sweet chocolate broken
2 tablespoon coffee, room temp.
1 tablespoon rum

Vegetable oil

1. Place oven rack in center of oven; heat to 350~F. Coat sides and
ends of 15-1/2 x 10-1/2 x 1 inch jellly-roll pan with oil; line pan
with oiled parchment or waxed paper, overhanging 1 inch on one end of
the pan. Reserve. 2. Melt chocolate with 2 tablespoons of the
espresso and the creme de cacao. 3. Beat egg yolks in medium mixer
bowl at high speed 1 minute; gradually beat in granulated sugar.
Continue beating until mix- ture is pale yellow and slightly thick;
about 3 minutes. Gradu- ally beat chocolate mixture into egg-yolk
mixture. 4. Beat egg whites in large mixer bowl at high speed until
stiff but not dry peaks form. Fold chocolate mixture thoroughly into
whites. 5. Spread mixture in reserved pan in even layer using the
back of a large wet spoon. Bake 15 minutes. 6. Transfer pan to wire
rack and cover with a slightly dampened lightweight kitchen towel;
cool to room temperature. (Cake can be set aside covered at room
temperature 2 to 3 hours). Remove towel. 7. Overlap, side by side,
two 16-inch sheets of waxed paper on work surface. Sprinkle top of
cake evenly with cocoa.  Loosen sides and ends of cake. Invert cake
onto waxed paper; remove pan and peel parchment liner from cake.
Reserve cake. 8. Whip cream in chilled mixer bowl at high sped until

cream while drizzling in remaining 3 tablespoons espresso; beat until
stiff peaks form. 9. Spoon whipped cream onto cake; spread evenly,
leaving 1-inch border of cake uncovered along one long side and both
ends. Beginning with the long side covered with cream, carefully roll
up cake jelly-roll fashion (use the waxed paper to help turn the
roll, but do not roll paper into the cake). Work as gently as
possible. (Cake will crack a bit on the sides) <snicker>. Then roll
entire cake snugly in waxed paper; place seam-side down on baking
sheet. Refrigerate until well chilled, about 2 hours. 10. Prepare
Chocolate Glaze. 11. Wile glaze is cooling, fold a 15 x 7-1/2 inch
piece of parchment paper wit a letter-fold to form a triple-thickness
15 x 2-1/2 inch strip. Place wire rack (or two small racks) long
enough to accommodate length of roll, on baking sheet, and place
parchment strip lengthwise on rack. Remove waxed paper from cake;
place cake seam-side down on parchment strip <snicker, snicker>. 12.
Pour Chocolate Glaze very slowly over cake to coat evenly; use a
spatula to spread around bottom curve of cake. (Scrape glaze
drippings from baking sheet with spatula into small bowl; let stand 3
minutes.  Drizzle crosswise over cake at 1/2 inch intervals, building
up smooth ridges, if desired.) 13. Refrigerate cake until glaze sets,
about 45 minutes. Transfer cake to serving platter <many more
snickers>. Cut roll cross- wise into 1 to 1-1/2 inch slices. Serve
immediately.

Chocolate Glaze 1. Measure butter, coffee, rum and corn syrup into
small saucepan. Heat over low heat to boiling; boil slowly, stirring
constantly, 1 minute. Remove from heat. 2. Stir in chocolate and
whisk until smooth. Let stand until glaze cools and thickly coats a
wooden spoon dipped into it, about 12 minutes. Use immediately.

2 cup hot milk -- (1 pint)
2  eggs
1/2 teaspoon vanilla essence or a pinch
1  spice
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon softened red jam -- (2 to

jam by warming or adding a little hot water. Spread jam on top of
pudding and cover with meringue. Bake until the meringue is lightly
coloured, 15 - 20 minutes. Serve hot or cold. Banana: Make in the
same way as Queen of Puddings, but add a mashed banana to the bread
mixture.  Mashed banana may also be mixed with the jam to spread on
top, or cover the top with sliced banana and omit the jam.
Butterscotch: Use the same recipe as Queen of Puddings, but with 1/2
cup (4 oz) brown sugar instead of the white sugar, and heat it with
the margarine until the sugar melts. Dissolve this in the hot milk
before proceeding in the usual way. Chocolate: Use the Queen of
Pudding recipe, adding an extra tablespoon of sugar and 4 level Tbs
cocoa to the breadcrumbs Coconut: Use the Queen of Pudding recipe,
adding 1/2 cup desiccated coconut to the crumbs. Orange or Lemon:
Use the Queen of Pudding recipe, adding the grated rind of one orange
or lemon.  Leave out the vanilla or spice and use marmalade instead
of jam.

Quicky Crumble

breakfast, cereals, deserts

1  whole wheat shreddies
3 tablespoon butter or margarine
1  grannysmith or macintosh apple, cor; ed
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon

Measure as much cereal as you want in your bowl (I use about 2 cups).
Crush to fine crumbs in blender, or place in a plastic bag, hold it
shut, and crush with the heel of your hand. Pour into medium mixing
bowl. In a one-cup measure, microwave the butter on 100% power until
melted; work butter into crumbs until mixture is moist and crumbly.
Slice apple into thin, even slices, then place in microwave-safe,
shallow baking dish. Spread cereal mixture evenly over apple slices.
Microwave on 50% power 3 min, or until heated through and apple is
tender. Sprinkle with cinnamon and brown sugar; microwave on 50%
power 2 min longer. Serve hot with a little milk, a pat of butter or
jam, or some fresh fruit.

Variations: I have enjoyed this dish with banana slices in place of
the apple. Also, substitute 1 tb your favorite jam for 1 tb of the
butter. Stir the jam into the butter in the cup immediately after
butter is melted. Try using an uncooked hot cereal, such as Cream of
Wheat or Quaker Oat bran in place of the Shreddies, for a deliciously
different porridge. Serve with whipped cream, ice cream or yogurt for
dessert.

Quince-And-Cranberry Compote

deserts

6 medium quince
6 cup water
2 cup sugar
12  cloves
18  whole allspice berries
1 large orange peel strip
2 pkg cranberries
1  cinnamon stick (3 long)
1  cranberry juice (optional)
1  balsamic vinegar, to taste

CUT EACH QUINCE INTO QUARTERS, then cut quarters into pieces about
1/2-inch thick. Grasp each piece firmly and cut away peel and core
with sharp knife. When all slices have been cored and peeled, cut
each piece into small chunks. Don't worry about the fruit
discoloring. In saucepan, combine water, sugar, spices and orange
peel. Bring mixture to boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Add quince.
Reduce heat, cover pan and cook very slowly until fruit has turned a
deep pink color, about 2 hours. You don't need to worry about
overcooking as the fruit will hold its texture well. If cooked
slowly, there should still be quite a bit of liquid in pan when fruit
is done. Sort through cranberries, remove those that are not in good
shape and rinse the rest. Add cranberries to cooked quince. If
mixture seems too dry, add a little more water or cranberry juice.
Increase heat a little and cook cranberries until they begin to pop
open, 12-to-15 minutes. Use rubber scraper to gently mix them with
quince. When done, refrigerate compote to cool, then stir in enough
vinegar to balance the sweetness.

dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and place
in a warm, draft-free place, and allow to rise for an additional 30
minutes. You can also do this step in the machine by punching the
dough down, closing the machine, and letting the dough rise for 30
minutes.

Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and cut it in half to
make it more manageable. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Roll it
out to 1/3" thick.  Flour a doughnut cutter and cut out doughnuts.
Lift each doughnut, pat it to remove excess flour, and place it on a
lightly oiled or sprayed baking sheet.  Cover the doughnuts with a
clean towel and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.

Put 1/2 cup powdered sugar in sturdy paper bag and spread out paper
towels near frying pan.  Heat 2" oil in a medium saucepan or deep
fryer to 375F. Slide 2 or 3 doughnuts at a time into the hot oil.
Turn them frequently and spoon the hot oil over them until they are
well puffed. Drain the doughnuts on paper towels and shake them with
the sugar in the bag while they are still warm.

Randy Pollak's Persimmon Pudding

christmas, deserts, puddings

1 cup flour
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon soda
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1  egg
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 cup milk
1 cup persimmon pulp
1 tablespoon melted butter
1 cup chopped nuts
1/2 cup raisins
      ----SAUCE----
1  egg yolk
3/4 cup powdered sugar  2t rum or brandy
1  whipped egg white
1/2 cup whipped cream

Mix the persimmon puree and the baking soda together and let it stand.
Cream together the sugar and butter, then add the egg, milk, vanilla,
(rum), and persimmon mixture. Add the remaining dry ingredients and
mix.

Pour into well-buttered pudding mold or tin can (i.e., a coffee can).
Fill them only 2/3 full. Place the mold on a trivet in a pan over a
few inches of boiling water. (I use one of those folding steamer
baskets). Cover the pan and steam over low heat for 2 hours. You will
need to add more boiling water as it evaporates. When a skewer tests
clean, it is done.

Let stand in the mold uncovered for about 15 minutes. Turn onto a
plate and let cool, or serve warm with hard sauce or whipped cream.
Beat the egg yolk with powdered sugar and rum or brandy. Fold in
whipped egg white and whipped cream.

Rasgoola

deserts, indian

1 liter homogenized milk
2 teaspoon white vinegar
1 1/2 cup sugar
3 cup water

1. Bring the milk to a boil and add vinegar to the boiling milk to
separate the whey. 2. Throw away the liquid part by sifting the stuff
onto a muslin cloth. 3. Pour some cold water over the curd to cool
and wash it. Throw the water and hang the cloth for 15-20 minutes to
let the excess water drip off. 4. Put the curd in a food processor or
blender and blend at high speed to get a smooth consistency. You may
add just a little (1 tsp or so) water while blending, if the curd is
too dry and will not blend. Be very careful so as not to add any
extra water. 5. Remove the paste and make small balls (1 to 2 inches
in diameter). 6. Boil water in a wide vessel. Make sure that there is
at least 2-3 inches of water in the vessel. If not, put more water
and increase the quantity of sugar proportionately. Add sugar to
boiling water to make a light syrup. 7. Continue boiling the syrup
and gently drop the curd balls in the boiling syrup. Cook the balls
in the boiling syrup for 30-40 minutes. 8. Remove from the heat and
let the stuff cool down. Put the balls and the syrup in a storage
container and refrigerate (don't freeze). 9. Serve cold.

Rasgulla

deserts, indian

300 gm paneer
175 gm ricotta cheese
350 gm sugar
1 1/4 liter ; water

Rub the paneer and ricotta cheese with palm of your hand until smooth
and creamy. Divide into 16 balls.

Boil the sugar and water for 5 minutes over medium heat. Put the
balls into the syrup and boil for 40 minutes.

Cover and continue to boil for another 30 minutes. Serve warm or cold.

*PANEER (Home-made cottage cheese) 3.5 litres milk about 250ml warm
water about 5 Tbsp white vinegar

1. Bring the milk to the boil, stirring constantly, over a high heat.
Remove from heat.

2. Combine the water and vinegar.

3. Slowly add the vinegar solution to the boiled milk, stirring with a
wooden spoon. As soon as the milk curdles, do not add any more. (The
curd and whey will separate.)

4. Place three or four layers of cheesecloth in a sieve and strain the
curdled milk through them. Ties up the ends of the cheesecloth and
squeeze out as much of the liquid as possible. Hang it up to drain
thoroughly.

Note: When adding the water and vinegar mixture to the milk, do not
add more than necessary as this tends to harden the paneer.

Raspberries With Peach Puree

deserts, fruits

4 medium peaches; peeled & pits removed
2 tablespoon raspberry vinegar; up to 3 tb
2 tablespoon sugar, powdered; or to taste
2 cup raspberries, fresh
1/2 cup creme fraiche; up to 3/4

"To peel peaches, bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. Drop 1
peach at a time gently into the boiling water, leave it for 5
seconds, and retrieve it by piercing the flesh with a fork. With a
paring knife, slit the skin, which will then slip off easily." "This
puree can be made several hours ahead but should be stirred before
spooning onto the plates. The raspberry vinegar holds the color of
the peaches, add a subtle tang, and heightens the flavor of the
raspberries. Pears may be substituted for the peaches and can simply
be peeled without first being dipped into boiling water." Puree the
peaches in a food processor or a food mill fitted with the finest
disk. (There should be about 1 cup puree.) Add the raspberry vinegar
and enough of the powdered sugar to balance the taste. Refrigerate
until serving time. Divide the puree among 4 dessert plates, spooning
it into a semicircle. Nestle a quarter of the raspberries beside each
serving of puree and pass the creme fraiche separately.

Raspberry Curd #1

deserts

3 cup raspberries
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup sugar -- * see note
1 cup unsalted butter
3  egg yolks

* if the berries are not sweet enough

Puree the raspberries, combine them with the lemon juice and sugar, if
needed.  Place in saucepan, simmer about 5 minutes, and strain
through a mesh sieve.

Place the strained raspberries in a blender or food processor. Melt
the butter in a saucepan until it is just bubbly. With the machine
running, slowly drizzle in the butter. Return the mixture to a
saucepan. In a mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks.  Add 3 or 4
tablespoons of the raspberry mixture to the egg yolks and blend well.
Pour the egg yolk and raspberry mixture into the saucepan with the
rest of the raspberry mixture. Over very low heat, stir until the
mixture thickens, about 10 or 15 minutes. Cool and refrigerate.

Raspberry curd will keep up to 10 days in the refrigerator. Makes

Raspberry Currant Coulis (Rodegruett)

deserts

2 1/2 cup red currants, stems removed, washed
1 1/4 cup raspberries, washed
3 cup water
1 cup to 1 1/2 c sugar (depending on tart; ness of the berries)
1/2  vanilla bean
5 tablespoon to 6 tb cornstarch, dissolved in 3/; 4 cup cold water

Cook the berries for 15 minutes in the water - until they are quite
soft. Press through a fine strainer; add to the fruit juice the sugar
and the vanilla scraped out of a slit bean, bring to a boil in a
non-reactive pot, and reduce while stirring vigorously. Add the
dissolved cornstarch to the sweetened fruit juice.  Bring to a boil
once more, then transfer the 'Rodegruett' to a glass baking dish that
has been rinsed with cold water. Chill in the refrigerator and serve.

Note:

Nowadays it is more customary to serve 'Rodegruett' in individual
bowls rather than a giant family-size trencher. Serve with cream,
cold milk, or cold Vanilla Sauce which only should be poured over the
'groats' before you're ready to eat.

Make sure the 'groats' are not too thick.  The correct consistency is
somewhere between that of a pudding and a puree (like thick pea
soup). When you first taste 'Rodegruett' made according to these
specifications, it may easily seem too sweet or the berry flavor may
seem a little overwhelming. However, bear in mind that after the
'groats' have cooled off a bit and milk or cream has been poured over
them, the taste will be considerably milder.

Variations:

Some or all of the strained berry pulp may be replace with an
equivalent amount of fruit juice, and quick-frozen berries or
preserves will do just about as well as fresh ones. Cherries,
morellos (sour cherries), and black currants are often used instead
of or in addition to red currants and raspberries. Many cooks like to
hold back some portion of the berries until after the straining so
they don't cook down like the others and you can still taste them
while eating the dish.

Tapioca is often used as a binding agent, and there are those who
maintain that this is the only 'authentic' method of making
'Rodegruett'. In Saxony and East Prussia, red griats have been made
with farina (semolina) for a number of years now, and since the words
for farina ('Griess') and groats ('Gruetze') are closely related,
sometimes even used interchangeably, it is no less possible that this
is in fact the 'original' version. All questions of authenticity
aside, a deluxe fortified 'Rodegruett' can be made by stewing the
berries in red wine or with some higher-proof alcoholic beverage.

Makes 4 to 6 servings.

Raspberry Meringue Shells

deserts

3  egg whites
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 dash salt
1 cup sugar
1  fresh raspberries
1  frozen vanilla yogurt
1  whipping cream, whipped
      ----OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS----
1  chambord or framboise liqueur

Servings:

To egg whites (at room temperature) add vanilla, cream of tartar, and
salt. Beat til frothy.  Gradually add sugar, a small amount at a
time, beating until very stiff peaks form and sugar is completely
dissolved.

Cover a cookie sheet with plain ungreased paper (I use brown paper
grocery bags).  Spoon meringue onto paper, dividing into 6 equal
mounds. Shape with the back of a spoon to form bird nest shapes. Bake
at 275 degrees F for one hour.  Turn off oven and let dry with the
door closed for at least another 1 1/2 hours.  If meringues will not
be used immediately, place into an airtight container to store, or
they can be left in an oven which has a pilot light overnight.

Place meringues on serving plates.  Place a large scoop of vanilla
frozen yogurt (or vanilla ice cream) into each meringue, smother with
fresh raspberries, drizzle with Chambord, Framboise, or other
raspberry liquor (optional), and top with whipped cream (or whipped
topping).

3/4 cup flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup sour cream
1 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup fresh raspberries
1 tablespoon powdered sugar

Cut the butter into pieces. In the bowl of a food processor, combine

baking sheet and prick all over with a fork. Refrigerate 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 375F. Bake the dough until lightly browned,
15-20 minutes. Let cool completely. Trim pastry to an 8 x 8" square
and cut it into eight 2 x 4" rectangles.

Beat the heavy cream with the sugar and vanilla until it holds firm
peaks. Put the whipped cream in a pastry bag fitted with a star tip
and pipe half of it onto for of the rectangles. Arrange the
raspberries on top of the cream, then pipe a second layer of cream
over the raspberries. Top the cream with the remaining pastry
rectangles, flat side up. Cover and refrigerate until serving. Before
serving, dust each Napoleon with powdered sugar.

1 1/3 cup raspberries, fresh or frozen
5 tablespoon sugar plus extra for souffle ish(es; )
1 1/2 teaspoon orange zest
2 tablespoon cornstarch
2 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice, fresh
2 tablespoon chambord or framboise
5  egg whites, at room temperat re
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1  salt, pinch
1  confectioner's sugar

Calories     per serving: 87 Fat grams per serving: 0 Approx. Cook
Time: 35 Cholesterol  per serving: 0
In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup raspberries, 2 tablespoons
sugar and grated orange zest. Bring to a boil over medium heat,
stirring and mashing the raspberries. Dissolve cornstarch in lemon
juice and add to raspberry mixture. Cook, stirring, for about 45
seconds, or until thickened and no longer cloudy. Remove from the
heat and stir in chambord or framboise and the remaining 1/3 cup
raspberries. Cool to room temperature. ( The recipe can be prepared
ahead to this point. Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days. Bring to
room temperature before proceeding. )
Position rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat oven to
350 degrees. Lightly coat the inside(s) of a 1 1/2-quart souffle dish
or six 1 1/2-cup individual souffle dishes with vegetable oil or
nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle with sugar and shake out excess.
In a large, grease-free mixing bowl, beat egg whites with an
electric mixer on medium speed until foamy and opaque. Add cream of
tartar and salt; gradually increase speed to high and beat until soft
peaks form. Gradually add remaining 3 tablespoons sugar and beat
until stiff ( but not dry ) peaks form.
Stir raspberry mixture well. Whisk about one-quarter of the beaten
egg whites into the raspberry mixture to lighten it. Using a rubber

2 1/2 tablespoon honey
3/4 cup well-chilled heavy cream
1/2 cup walnuts, toasted lightly, cooled, a; nd chopped
6  chocolate curls, if desired

two 10 ounce pkgs. frozen raspberries in light syrup, thawed fresh

In a metal bowl beat together the eggs, the sugar, and the honey, set
the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, and beat the mixture
until it is pale, thickened, and registers 160 F on a candy
thermometer. Beat the mixture set over a larger bowl of ice and cold
water until it is cold, in another bowl beat the cream until it just
holds stiff peaks, and fold the cream and the walnuts into the egg
mixture gently but thoroughly. Spoon the raspberry puree and the egg
mixture decoratively into 6 ounce glasses, make swirls with a wooden
skewer, and freeze the parfaits, covered, overnight. The parfaits may
be made 2 days in advance and kept covered and frozen. Let the
parfaits stand for 15 minutes before serving. Arrange the chocolate
curls and the fresh raspberries decoratively on the parfaits. Serves 6

Raspberry Tart (Tarte Aux Framboises)

deserts

250 gm sweet flan pastry (9 oz),see  lemon; tart
      ----FILLING----
200 gm raspberries (7 oz)
1 single egg
70 gm sugar (2 1/2 oz)
100 ml double cream (scant 1/4 pint
2 single egg yolks

It is particularly important not to allow the filling of this tart to
boil ~ it might do so towards the end of its cooking time.

Pre-heat the oven to 260 oC/500 oF.

Lightly butter and flour an 18 cm ( 7 in) tart tin with a removable
base.

Line the prepared tart tin. Blind-bake it for about 10 ... 15 minutes,
protecting the edges with aluminium foil. Leave it to cool in its tin.

Reduce the oven temperature to 190 oC/375 oF.

Whisk the egg, egg yolks, sugar and cream together, making sure the
sugar dissolves.

Arrange the raspberries on the bottom of the pre-cooked pastry shell,
pointed ends facing upwards, in concentric circles. Cover them with
the egg mixture.

Bake the tart for about 40 minutes in the bottom of the oven. WATCH
VERY CAREFULLY TO SEE THAT THE FILLING NEVER REACHES BOILING POINT.

When the tart has cooled completely, take it out of the tin.

Raspberry-Blackberry Gratin

deserts

3  egg yolks from extra-large eggs
1 tablespoon water
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup framboise (raspberry brandy)
2 cup heavy cream, chilled
3 cup raspberries
3 cup blackberries

Combine the egg yolks, water and sugar in a metal bowl set over,
but not touching, gently simmering water, or in the top pan of a
double boiler set over simmering water. Whisk constantly until the
mixture is foamy and begins to thicken slightly, 2-3 minutes.
Immediately remove from the heat and strain into a 2-quart metal
bowl. (The use of a metal bowl will help cool down the mixture more
quickly.)  Stir in the Framboise, cover and refrigerate for at least
4 hours or overnight.
Just before serving, position the rack 3-4 inches from the heat
source in a broiler and preheat the broiler.
Using chilled beaters and a large chilled bowl, whip the cream
until stiff peaks form.  Gently fold the cream into the chilled
custard. Scatter all the berries over the bottom of a 2-quart
ovenproof baking dish with at least 1-inch sides.  Place the dish on
a heavy-duty baking sheet or in a shallow baking pan to make for
easier removal from the broiler. Gently pour and spoon the custard
over the berries.
Broil (grill) until the top is browned and bubbling, 1-1/2 - 2
minutes.  Serve immediately.

Ravioli San Guiseppe

deserts

1  for dough
8 oz plain flour, sifted
1  pinch of salt
2 1/2 oz caster sugar
4 1/2 oz butter, diced
1  egg
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
1  for filling
3 fl oz hot weak china tea
12 oz caster sugar
6  no need to soak prunes
1 lb apples
2 oz pine nut kernels
1  icing sugar to dust
1  to serve
1  whipped cream or vanilla
1  ice cream.

To make the dough, put the flour, salt and sugar in a food processor
and, with the machine running at full speed, add the butter until
incorporated. Then add the egg and lemon zest and process for a few
seconds until a soft dough has formed. Scrape the dough onto a sheet
of clingfilm, then form into a cylinder and chill for at least 1
hour. To make the filling, sweeten the tea with 2 tspn sugar and soak
the prunes in it. Peel, core and slice the apples. Put the rest of
the sugar in a large pan with 2 tbsp water. Heat gently, stirring
occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved. Add the apple slices.
Increase the heat to medium and cook, without stirring, until the
apples are candied (approx. 20 mins). Most of the liquid will
evaporate leaving a thick syrup. Drain and chop the prunes and add to
the pan with the pine nut kernels. Remove from the heat, cool
slightly then transfer to a bowl and leave to cool. Preheat the oven
to 180'C (350'F). To assemble the ravioli, cut a slice off the end of
the dough cylinder and roll out on a floured surface. Use a 3 inch
cutter to cut out a neat circle. Repeat using the rest of the dough
to make approx. 20 circles. Place a small spoonful of the filling on
each circle. Brush the edges with a little water and fold over to
make a half circle. Crimp the edges to seal firmly. Place all the
ravioli on a greased baking sheet and bake for 10-15 minutes or until
light golden. Cool slightly and dust with icing sugar and serve with
cream or ice cream.

Receta De  Flan Antigua

deserts

2/3 cup gran. sugar ( for caramel )
1/4 cup drk brn sugar (for caramel)
5  eggs
2  egg yolks
4 cup half & half
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1  *rum and brandy syrup*
1 cup granulated sugar
6 oz water
1 oz brandy
1 tablespoon rum extract

Servings:  9

Have a 2 quart pudding dish, or 9 single serving dishes ready. Be
sure they are dry. Melt and carmelize the 2/3 cup sugar,and the 1/4
cup brown sugar in a heavy skillet. When sugar melts and turns a dark
golden color (about 5 min.) pour into the custard dishes and tilt
back and forth with a swirling motion to cover bottom and sides of
dish. It may be necessary to spread the caramel with a spoon. Set
aside and allow to cool. Beat eggs and the egg yolks into the half
and half. Add the salt and sugar. Stir until sugar dissolves. Add
vanilla. Strain, and pour into prepared custard dish. Preheat oven to
325 degrees. Set dish in a pan of hot water and bake, covered with
foil. Bake the large custard about 1 1/2 hrs. or until a knife
inserted in center comes out clean. The smaller ones will cook about
1 hr. Perform knife test as above. Remove from the oven and allow to
cool slightly. Place a round rimmed platter over the large flan or a
serving plate over each of the single serving flans and flip them
over slowly. Do this carefully, as the caramelized syrup will pour
out as the flan releases from the container. Cool and serve. I
sometimes garnish with pecan halves.

***** Rum and Brandy Syrup *****

Caramelize the sugar in a heavy skillet. Add water and stir until the
caramel is dissolved. Boil until quite thick. Add the Brandy and Rum
extract and stir until combined. Cool and serve with the flan for
those who desire additional syrup with a slightly different flavor.

Red Raspberry Tart

deserts

1  the crust:  makes two 8-10
1  inch tarts
2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon granulated sugar --
1  optional
1 cup cold unsalted butter -- cut
1  into small piece
1/4 cup to 1/2 cup ice water
1  the filling:
1 pint heavy cream
1/3 cup quince syrup -- (below)
3 pint fresh red raspberries
1  the glaze:
1/4 cup quince jelly (below) --
1  melted and cooled
1  slightly
1  quince jelly: (makes appr. 2
1  pints)
4 cup quinces -- stemmed, seeded,
1  and
1  cut up
1  granulated sugar
1  quince syrup:
4 cup quinces, stemmed, seeded,
1  and cut up
1  granulated sugar

To make crust: All ingredients should be cold. Put flour, salt and
sugar in the bowl of a food processor. Add butter and process for
approximately 10 seconds, or just until the mixture resembles coarse
meal. Add ice water, drop by drop, through the feed tube with the
machine running, just until the dough holds together without being
wet or sticky. (Don't process more than 30 seconds.) Test the dough
by squeezing a small amount together. If it's crumbly, add a bit more
water.

Turn half the dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap. Grasping
the ends of the plastic wrap with your hands, cover dough with the
plastic and press it into into a flat circle with your fists. Repeat
process with other half. Wrap dough in the plastic and chill for at
least an hour.

Lightly butter (or spray with vegetable cooking spray) an 8-inch
heart-shaped tart pan.

On a lightly floured board, roll out one of the pastry circles to a
thickness of 1/8 inch. Place the pastry in the pan, which has been
set on a parchment-lined baking sheet, and press it into the bottom
edges and along the sides. Trim pastry with scissors. (I often cut
the pastry an inch higher than the pan's edge and tuck this overhang
to the inside of the pan for extra height and reinforcement.) Crimp
edges. Chill until ready to use. Repeat process with second pastry
circle. If you plan to make only one tart, freeze this unbaked shell
for future use.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cover the pastry with aluminum foil and
then carefully press foil into the corners and edges to form a
lining. Weight with ceramic or aluminum weights. (Or use uncooked
beans or rice.)

Bake for 25 minutes. When pastry begins to color around the edges,
remove foil and weights and continue baking until the pastry turns a
deep amber color. Cool completely before filling.

To make Quince Jelly: Cook quinces with enough water to cover until
very soft. Pour into a jelly bag (or fine linen dishcloth). Let the
juice drip through without squeezing or pressing. To each cup of
juice add 1 cup sugar. Bring to a boil and, while keeping at a full
rolling boil, skim off any scum. Cook until jelly coats a metal
spoon. Store in coveredjars in refrigerator.

To make Quince Syrup: Proceed as for jelly, but cook the juice only
until the liquid begins to thicken. The mixture should remain liquid
and should not jell.

To make filling: Whip the cream until soft peaks form. Add syrup and
whip until stiff. Spread cream evenly in tart shell. Carefully
arrange half the raspberries on top of cream. Make a neat second
layer with remaining berries. Lightly glaze berries with melted
quince jelly. Serve immediately.

Reduced-Sugar Blackberry & Crabapple Jam

deserts, fruits, spreads

500 gm blackberries
300 gm crabapples
200 ml water
350 gm sugar
2 tablespoon lemon juice

NOTES: 1) The set of this spread is softer than conventional jam
:       as it has less sugar.

2) Also, it MUST be kept in the fridge - will keep for 1
:       month. Will freeze also, but thawed jam must be used
:       within 2 weeks.

3) Try reducing the sugar further from 350g to 300g. Sterilize
some jars - wash in hot soapy water and rinse well. Shake out as much
water as you can, then dry in a 160 C (325 F, Gas 3) oven for at least
10    minutes.

Put a saucer in the fridge to chill.

EITHER grate the crabapples, discarding the cores, OR cut out the
cores and chop the apples finely in a processor. Put the berries,
apples and water in a saucepan. Bring to the boil then simmer 5
minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the sugar and lemon juice. Stir
until sugar is dissolved then increase heat and boil rapidly for 7
minutes. Remove from heat and test for set: put a teaspoonful onto
the chilled saucer and chill again for at least 2 minutes until cold.
This is what the jam will be like when it has cooled. If it is too
runny, clean off the saucer (so you don't get mixed up!), put it back
into the fridge and boil the jam for another minute or so. Test
again.  When happy with set, ladle into hot sterilized jars and put
on lids.

3/4 cup granulated sugar
3  eggs
1  egg yolk
1/2 cup whipping cream
1/3 teaspoon vanilla
1  pie dough for 10-in.shell

Raspberries and rhubarb in one tart means that one of the fruits must
be frozen if locally produced products are to be used. Happily, this
dish works well with either fresh or frozen berries or rhubarb. The
reds and pinks are beautiful together and the flavours blend
wonderfully. 1. Roll out pie dough into 10-inch tart or pie pan. 2.
Cut rhubarb into 1/4 inch pieces, distribute evenly in tart shell,
then sprinkle with raspberries. 3. Combine sugar, eggs and egg yolk
in a mixing bowl; whisk ingredients together. 4. Add cream and
vanilla and mix. 5. Pour egg mixture over fruit and bake in preheated
400F(200C) oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until tart batter is quite

Rhubarb Fool

deserts, low fat

1 lb fresh rhubarb
1  juice and rind of one
1  orange
1  sugar to taste
1  sachet gelatine
1  cream substitute of some
1  sort: yogurt, fromage frais,
1  evaporated milk,
1  whatever

Stew the rhubarb with the orange rind/juice, sugar, and as little
water as you can get away with.  Melt in the gelatine (if you are
vegetarian or vegan, use another gelling agent), and then put through
food processor to make puree.  Add the cream substitute - I would use
fromage frais, but yogurt is fine, or you might like whisked
evaporated milk, if you like the taste.  Then refrigerate until set.

If, like me, the mere thought of rhubarb sets your teeth on edge
(it's one of the very few things I really can't eat!), then use a
different fruit - gooseberries, perhaps, or dried apricots.
Gooseberries are nicest if stewed with elderflowers, if you can get
them, and dried apricots don't need any help. I've not quoted
quantities for the sugar, because it depends on your taste.

1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoon raspberry liqueur (or other fruit f; lavor)

Cook the sugar and water until it forms a thick syrup (the temperature

the salt and cream of tartar, and continue to beat until they start
to form soft peaks.  Add in a slow steady stream the hot sugar syrup,
beating constantly, and continue to beat until the mixture has cooled
and is thick. Beat the cream in a separate bowl until almost stiff,
then beat in the liqueur.  Fold the whipped cream into the egg
white-sugar syrup mixture and freeze for 2 hours. Remove the bowl
from the freezer and stir in the pureed rhubarb. If you are not
serving immediately, hold the mousse in the freezer. Serve in a glass
bowl or in sherbet glasses, decorated with berries. Serves 8.

Rhubarb Sorbet

deserts, fruits

1 lb rhubarb (trimmed weight)
4 tablespoon honey
1  orange (zest only)
2  egg whites

Prepare and cook the rhubarb at least a day ahead of serving the
sorbet. Wipe and trim the fruit, then slice it quite thinly into a
flameproof casserole. Sprinke the finely grated orange zest over it
and drizzle on 2 tablespoons of the honey.  Cover and leave in a cool
place for 2 hours or more until the sweetener has drawn out some of
the rhubarb juices; this liquid will prevent sticking during cooking.

Cook the rhubarb in the covered dish until perfectly tender - I
think this is best done in a low oven but you can use a very gentle
flame on top of the stove if you prefer. Let the cooked rhubarb cool
slightly, then add the remaining 2 tablespoons honey and whizz to a
very smooth puree in a food-processor.

When the puree is quite cold, freeze it in a chilled loaf tin, or
other suitable container, until firm round the edges. Beat the
half-frozen sorbet until slushly.  Whisk the egg whites and fold them
in so the mixture looks like a pale pink snow.  Cover and freeze
until solid. Beat to break up ice crystals and to increase bulk, then
freeze the sorbet again until you are ready to serve it.  Shortbread
fingers make a good crunchy accompaniment.

2 tablespoon water
1  filling:
1 cup walnuts,hazelnuts or pecans  finely; ground

spray (i.e.,PAM). Press the dough onto the bottom and up the sides of
the pan. Set aside.

To prepare the filling: Spread the nuts over the dough in the pan.
Combine the sugar, flour, orange zest, rhubarb and strawberries in a
bowl. Set aside while preparing the topping.

To prepare the topping: Combine the brown sugar,cinnamon and flour.
Add the butter and work together to form coarse crumbs.

Stir the fruit and pour into the crust. Sprinkle the topping over the
filling and place tart on a baking sheet.

Place on the lowest oven rack of a preheated 400 degree F. oven and
bake 50 minutes, until the juices are bubbly and the crust is browned.

Let cool on a rack before serving.

Rick Eastes's Berry Sorbet

deserts

2 cup blackberries,rinsed/drained
2 cup raspberries,rinsed/drained
1/2 cup powdered fructose
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoon lime juice
1  blackberries,rinsed/drained*
1  raspberries,rinsed/drained*
1  black-raspberry liqueur

Rick Eastes travels to Chile routinely to arrange for shipping that
country's seasonal fruits here. It's summer in Chile now, so his Berry
Sorbet is seasonal, sort of. In it he uses fructose. Not because this
sugar is more easily digested by some people, but because he had some
on the shelf the day he ran out of granulated sugar. If you've run
out of fructose, you can use granulated sugar it its place.

* - optional

1. In a 2-3 quart pan, combine the 2 cups of blackberries and
raspberries, fructose, water, and lime juice. Bring to a boil over
high heat, stirring often. Then reduce heat and simmer until
blackberries mash redily, 3-4 minutes. Whirl mixture, a portion at a
time, in blender or food processor until smoothly pureed. To remove
seeds, rub puree through a fine strainer into a bowl.
2. Pour puree into a 9-10" square metal pan. Cover airtight and freeze
until firm, at least 8 hours or up to 2 weeks.
3. Frozen sorbet has an icy texture. If you like a softer texture,
break frozen sorbet into chunks and beat with a mixer until slushy;
serve at once or return to freezer up to 1 hour. Top servings of
sorbet with additional berries and liqueur to taste (1-2 tablespoons
per portion). Makes about 3 cups.

Ricotta Con Le Fragole (Strawberries With Ric

deserts, italian

1  text only

Unlike most other cheeses, Italian ricotta is comparatively low in
fat and has only 420 kilojoules per 100 g compared to cream's 1400.
So this recipe for ricotta cream is an excellent and rich-tasting
alternative to whipped cream.

Hull 3 punnets of strawberries and put them in 1 large or 6 individual
dishes.  Put 450 g ricotta cheese in a food processor and add 2 egg
yolks, 2 tablespoons of rum, the grated zest of a lemon and 3
tablespoons of honey or sugar.  Process, pour over the strawberries
and chill until serving.

Makes 6 servings.

Rock Candy (Mays)

candy

1  rock candy is easy!  you
1  don't really need a 'recipe'
1  here's how you do
1  it ..

Take about a cup of water (or more, if you want to make several
pieces of candy), and heat it in a saucepan until it almost boils.
Turn off the heat. Start stirring in granulated sugar, making sure
that each addition is *completely dissolved* before you add more. You
are aiming for a 'supersaturation solution' of sugar in the water.

When you can no longer add sugar to the solution, it is ready. Let it
cool a bit, and then pour it into a tall, narrow jar (or jars).
Suspend a clean piece of cotton string into the center of the syrup.
Tying the top end of the string to a pencil that sits on the rim of
the jar works well. Cover the solution loosely so that dust or other
contaminants will not float into the sugar solution, and put the
whole thing into an out-of-the-way place for two to three weeks.
Don't shake or disturb it.

During that time, larger than normal sugar crystals will form on the
cotton string and possibly in the bottom of the jar. When the
crystals have stopped growing or are as big as you like them, take
the string out, briefly rinse the crystals in clear water and hang
them to dry for a few minutes.  Rock candy!

You can also add food coloring to the sugar solution. The crystals
will pick up a tint on the tips from it, and it looks kind of neat.

      ----SPRAY TABLE & ROLLING PIN W----
1/2 cup cornstarch
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
      ----PREPARE CAKE;AS BELOW----
      ----IN GLASS MEASURING CUP ADD----
1 tablespoon knox gelatin; rounded**
1  water to = 1/4 cup*****
      ----SET M.CUP IN 1"BOILING WATER---
1/2 cup wilton glucose<now=1/4 c.>
2 tablespoon crisco (need the 3#can too)*
1 tablespoon glycerine***
1 lb more confectioners' sugar
3 cup *apricot glaze or other

BEFORE STARTING!: Prepare cake as below. *Sift 2 lbs p.sugar into a
large bowl w/round bottom; Make "well" in center of the sugar for wet
ingredients **Use only Knox brand, others are different! ***1 small
bottle of Country Kitchen glycerine= 1 tb. ****Dip spoon in boiling
water, then measure Crisco. *****The "x" is used for the database,
ignore. DIRECTIONS: 1. BEFORE YOU MIX INGRED.: Spray the table <where
dough will be rolled out> w/PAM & dust table/rolling pin <using a
sieve> w/cornstarch/conf.sugar mixture. 2. Prepare cake:
Bake cake & place on 2 STURDY! foil-wrapped card boards the size
of the cake. <Have fancy STURDY! tray ready that is 3-4" larger than
cake.> "Cur tains" break if c.board flexes!
A solid cake should be used, such as FRUIT, CARROT or POUND cake
should be used. Torte as usual. Set aside to cool several hours. I
have used reg. cake.
Fill in any holes or uneven places with butter- cream icing so
cake is nice & smooth. 3. With your hands, rub something sticky on
the cake <for rolled icing to stick to>. I use *apricot filling -the
kind baker's use. You can use piping gel for fake cakes. * Coat the
cake <just> before making the icing. You wouldn't want this to dry
over. 4. Put 1 rounded ts Knox Gelatin in a glass measuring cup; add
cold water to equal 1/4 cup. Stir until gelatin is dissolved.

Rolled Fondant Icing Note 3 Of 4 Bswn00a

icing

      ----HINTS----

12. TO DECORATE: Use royal icing only - on rolled f.
Use wax paper to make template patterns. All pat terns should be
even & line up. I use calculator paper for making patterns for sides
of cake. You can accordion-fold it & cut scallops, etc. Place pattern
against cake & mark with sharp object. Modes of decoration for Rolled
Fondant cakes include: ~Lace pieces <trace patter w/#00 tip> ~RIBBON
INSERTION <pieces of ribbon inserted to appear to be lacing in & out
of cake.> ~"CURTAINS" #00 tip <w/smaller tip, less line break!>
First, build out "bridge" of scallops at base by over- piping #13,
then #4,3,& 2. To pipe curtains; start at top <on your marked
pattern,> drape to bottom & slightly under edge of icing "bridge."
Curtains should be close <no wider than width of icing drape
between.> Finish w/#1 tiny "bubble" at top & base of curtains.
~CRIMPERS: use fancy crimpers to press fancy patterns into icing.
~EMBROIDERY: DONE W/#0 to #1 tips. Its like figure- piping. Draw tiny
stems/leaves/flowers onto the cake.
Easy - can wipe off any mistakes. ~LEATHER TOOLS/OTHER PRESSES: Use
these to press pat terns into cake. Hearts, flowers & many other
patterns are available. Tandy leather tools avail. at leather shops.
~DO IMMEDIATELY: ribbon insertion, pattern pressing & crimping. ~When
using GRAYSLAKE gelatin, increase gelatin to 1 1/2 tb. ~If ingred.
get to hot, it may take more confect. sugar ~If gel or filling gets
on icing, use a bit of corn starch/confect.sugar mixture to rub off
the shine. ~Too cold a room can cool icing off too quickly. NO AIR
SHOULD EVER BLOW DIRECTLY ON THE ICING. ~LEFTOVER ICING: Can be
rolled out & cut with cookie cutters, etc., dry & use on other cakes.
*We use a "bib" cutter to make bibs, also booties, hearts, stand-up
characters, all sorts of things. ~Keeps indefinitely sealed &
refrigerated. ~Use for candy center; add flavors/color/nuts, etc..Can
add butter to thin. Dip in dipping chocolate. ~Make candy "rocks":
marble-color & shape. *Continued note 4......

      ----DIRECTIONS CONTINUED----

5. Set the glass measuring cup in a pan with 1" of very hot water in
it. Add into the cup: Glucose <to=3/4 cup in all>, Crisco & glucose.
Stir w/<wooden> spoon <just barely> until Crisco is dis solved. DO
NOT GET THIS MIXTURE MORE THAN WARM! 6. If adding flavor/color, do
this now. 7. Pour the cup of warm ingredients into the "well" of
conf.sugar. Stir w/wooden spoon until too thick.
Pour mixture out onto the cornstarch/conf.sugar, knead w/hands &
incorporate as much conf.sugar from pinch the dough. It shouldn't feel
sticky. 8. Roll out the dough 1/4" thick.
<<<<NEVER TURN DOUGH OVER!>>>> Stop frequently & turn. Try not to get
conf.sugar on the top-side. Use a RULER to measure. The dough should
be large enough around for both the top & sides of cake. <For
instance: 8"cake, dough should measure 14" in diameter if cake is 3"
high.> Is table wide enough? 9. To drape icing on the cake: Elevate
the cake on the Crisco pan.
USING <PALMS> ONLY!, pick up icing dough by sliding both hands
underneath & lifting gently.
Center icing to cake & gently let it down on the cake. DON'T PLEAT!
Cut off excess dough ABSOLUTELY level with bottom of c.board cake is
setting on.
Gently work out the "draping," by pressing gently with fingers. DON'T
STRETCH THE ICING! 10. Now, using palms of hands only, rub gently in a
circular motion to smooth. <The longer you "rub", the shinier the
icing will get.> *If there are any "bubbles" in the icing, burst with
a pin at an angle. 11. USING ON A CAKE DUMMY FOR SHOW: Use the porous
foam that mashes. With a gumpaste roller, roll top edge to it isn't
so sharp. Also mash any rough places. Fill in any holes w/royal
icing. Set dummy on a cardboard the same size as the cake, glue down
with royal icing.
Use piping gel for the "glue" to stick icing on. *Continued note

Royal Frosting - Country Living Holidays

frostings, holiday

1 lb confectioners' sugar
3 large egg whites
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1  paste or powdered food coloring (op; t.)

1. In medium-size bodwl, with electric mixer, combine sugar, egg
whites, and cream of tartar just until well mixed. At high speed,
beat mixture until thick and fluffy.

2. Cover frosting tightly with a damp towel or plastic wrap while us-
ing. If desired, to color frosting, divide into small bowls and mix
in food coloring.

Note: This frosting is used not only to decorate or spread onto
cookies but also as an adhesive. Because of current health concerns
about salmonella in raw eggs, frosting on cookies that will be eaten
should be made from meringue powder instead of egg whites following
package instructions. For purely decorative cookies, we prefer this
egg-white frosting over the meringue-powder version because of its
stronger gluing property.

Rum/Bourbon Balls

deserts

3 cup vanilla wafers (crushed)
1 cup sugar, powered
1 1/2 cup nuts, chopped
1 1/2 teaspoon cocoa powder
2 tablespoon corn syrup, white (honey also works; well)
1/2 cup rum or bourbon

Mix all dry ingredients and set aside.

Mix corn syrup or honey with rum or bourbon to thin the syrup.  Blend wet
mixture into dry ingredients with fork.  Mix well.  Allow to sit for 1-2
hours.

At this point, if you let it sit a couple of hours, you can come back and
add another about 1/2 cup of rum or bourbon and let sit again. This process
may be repeated a few times to your taste. The last time, the mix should
sit a couple of hours so it's not really moist. There's a good midpoint
between too moist and too dry where rolling into balls won't be difficult
(too wet) or cause crumbling (too dry).

Roll into balls, then roll in powered sugar to make a sugar coating. When
rolling in powered sugar, the moister they are, the more sugar will be
absorbed over time.  They may need another roll in the sugar right before
serving.

NOTES:

*  Intoxicating chocolate snack with rum or bourbon -- I got this from my
mom who uses more alcohol than the original recipe called for but less than
I like to use. It makes a great party snack. Yield: Makes about 30 small
balls.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  1/2 to 1 hour preparation; 3 or more hours waiting.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

Rum-Glazed Sweet Potato Pudding

deserts, historical

1/3 cup sweet or dry sherry or madeira
2/3 cup raisins
2 lb sweet potatoes, baked, boiled or st; eamed until tender
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
4 large eggs
2 cup milk
1 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon mace
1  pinch of salt
1  grated zest of 1 orange
2 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 cup +1 tablespoon dark rum

Pour the sherry or Madeira over the raisins in a small bowl; let
stand for 30 minutes or longer.

Preheat the oven to 375F., with a rack in the center. Butter an 11"
oval gratin dish or other shallow baking dish; set aside.

Halve the cooked sweet potatoes; scoop out the flesh and place it in a
large bowl.  Add 1/4c +1 Tbsp of the melted butter. Add the eggs, one
at a time, and beat with an electric mixer into the sweet
potato-butter mixture. Add the milk, 1/3 cup of the brown sugar, the
mace, salt and orange zest and beat until blended. Beat in the
raisins and their soaking liquid. Scoop the mixture into the baking
dish.

Warm the remaining 3 tablespoons melted butter in a small skillet.
Stir in the remaining 2/3 cup brown sugar and the lemon juice; cook
over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until bubbly, 3 to 5
minutes. Stir in the rum and return the mixture to a boil. Drizzle
the rum glaze randomly over the surface of the sweet potato mixture.

Bake until the pudding is set and the glaze is bubbly, and about 45
minutes.  Serves 6-8.

18th Century Recipe Note:
This is a simple baked pudding with a base of mashed sweet potatoes.
It has a wonderfully rich flavor. In colonial America, sweet potatoes
were far more common than white ones. (Some recipes call for yams,
with which sweet potatoes have become permanent confused. Virtually
all of what we buy today, regardless of how they are labeled, are
sweet potatoes. The confusion began when African-born slaves gave
their native name -- yam -- to sweet potatoes.)

Essentually a pleasant variation on the Thanksgiving classic that is
often topped with arc-welded marshmallows, this pudding is not
cloyingly sweet and allows the sweet potatoes own nice flavor to come
through. Serve it warm, topped with whipped cream flavored with
vanilla and dark rum.

3 cup vanilla wafers crushed fine
1 cup walnuts chopped fine
3 tablespoon corn syrup

3 tablespoon cocoa powder
1 cup 10x sugar

Mix all ingredients except powdered sugar. I find that I have to add
more rum to make the "dough" stick together. Roll into small balls
about 1 inch in diameter. Then roll in powdered sugar.
I usually double this recipe as these are eaten FAST! Put in tightly
covered container and leave in a place where you won't be tempted to
eat them for 3 weeks minimum. They can have a different flavor
depending on the type/brand of rum you use.

the sugar. Dot with butter. Fold pastry overhang over fruit, brush
with milk, and sprinkle a little more sugar over. Bake in 425 F oven

Sacher-Bits (Steve Shanker)

deserts

3/4 cup butter
3 oz unsweetened chocolate
1 1/2 cup sugar
3  eggs
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 1/4 cup flour
2 cup preserves (we used 1 c raspberry on; one half, and 1 cup
1  apricot on the other)
9 oz (approx) semisweet chocolate chips

We've all heard of Sacher-torte, that wonderfully decadent candy
chocolate glazed torte with the apricot filling. Well, a while back
Deb started to make it but realized she didn't really have the time
on that day and did an experiment instead.  This is every bit as good
as the real thing and a hell of a lot simpler to do. We wanted to see
how raspberry was and it was just as good as the apricot, soooo, make
half and half, or better yet, just do a double batch.  Its sooo good
for the waistline. Make a few batches of this and I guarantee you'll
come away looking just like Santa...ho ho ho!

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Grease a 15x10x1" pan.

In a medium saucepan, melt butter and chocolate over low heat. Remove
from heat; stir in sugar.  Blend in eggs, one at a time. Add vanilla.
Stir in flour. Spread in pan. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, till done. Cool.
Spread preserves over top. Melt chips over low heat and drizzle over
top of pan. Chill to harden.

Cut into small 'brownie' sized pieces and serve.  Best if kept cool.

vanilla if using powder) then sift together. Add dry mixture to
creamed mixture, alternating with milk. Roll dough 1/2 inch thick on
floured board. Cut into rounds, and cut out centers. A glass works
well for cutting, with a small, empty prescription pill bottle to cut
the centers. The centers can be rolled together for more doughnuts or
fried as they are for 'donut holes.' Deep fry in vegetable oil,
turning once, until browned. Drain on grocery bag (to absorb oil) and
dust with confectioner's sugar. Yield: depends on how thin you roll,
and what you do with the centers.

Samboosak Hilwah (Triangles W/Sweet Almond Fi

deserts, holiday, saudi arabi

8 oz filo dough; 1/2 package;thaw
1/2 cup unsalted butter; melted
      ----FILLING----
1 pinch saffron; soaked in:
2 tablespoon rosewater
1/2 cup almonds; pulverized with:
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 tablespoon ground cardamom; to 1 1/2 t
      ----GLAZE----
1  egg; beaten
1  sugar

"This is a sweet version of the meaty triangles popular in the Gulf
States during the holy month of Ramadan."

1. Combine the filling ingredients (saffron, rosewater, almonds, 1/3 c
sugar, and cardamom).

2. Preheat the oven to 375'F. Grease 1 or 2 baking sheets.

3. Cut the defrosted filo strips 2 1/2 to 3 inches wide, stacking and
covering with a slightly dampened towel to prevent drying. Lay 3 to 4
strips on your work surface and brush lightly with melted butter.
Layer a second strip on top of each.

4. Place a tablespoon of the filling toward the bottom right-hand
corner of each strip. Fold that corner diagonally over to the top
left-hand corner, forming a triangle. As you fold, be certain that
the side of the strip lines up perfectly with the folded portion.
Then fold straight up. Continue as if folding a flag, alternately
folding the bottom corners in a diagonal pattern and up. Place on the
baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.

Scottish Trifle

deserts

1  sponge roll:
3 large eggs
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
3/4 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/3 cup raspberry jam, seedless
1 tablespoon kirsch
1/4 cup med-dry sherry
1  custard:
7 large egg yolks
1 cup sugar
2 cup milk, scalded & cooled
1/2 cup heavy cream, scalded & coole  sligh; tly
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup creme fraiche
1/4 cup med-dry sherry
1  assembly:
1 1/2 cup amaretti
1/4 cup med-dry sherry
1 cup heavy cream, well chilled
1  garnish:
2 tablespoon pistachio nuts, shelled and hopped
1  candied citron or angelica, ut into; bits
1  raspberry jam, seedless

In a large bowl with an electric mixer, beat the eggs, sugar, and
vanilla, until the mixture is thick and pale. Sift the flour and
baking powder over the egg mixture and fold them into it gently but
thoroughly. Line the bottom of a 13x9x2-inch baking pan with
parchment paper, spread the batter in the pan and bake in a preheated
400f oven for 8 minutes or until it is puffed and golden.  Invert
onto a lightly sugared kitchen towel.

In a small saucepan, melt the jam over low heat.  Stir in kirsch and
spread the surface of the cake with the jam mixture. Starting with a
long side and using the towel as a guide, roll up the cake,
jelly-roll fashion and sprinkle it with Sherry.  Wrap the sponge roll
firmly in the towel. Let it cool and cut int into 3/4-inch slices.

In a bowl, set over a saucepan of simmering water, beat the yolks and
the sugar with an electric mixer until the mixture is thick and pale.
Remove from heat and stir in gradually, milk, cream, and vanilla.
Cook the custard in the bowl over the simmering water, until it
registers 170f on a candy thermometer. Transfer the custard to a
metal bowl and whisk in the creme fraiche and Sherry.  Set the bowl
in a larger bowl of ice water and whisk until custard is cool. Chill
it, covering surface with plastic wrap, until it is cold.

Assembly:     In the bottom of a 2-1/2-qt. trifle bowl, scatter half
the amaretti crumbs.  Top them with half the sponge roll slices, and
top those with the remaining amaretti crumbs. Sprinkle the Sherry
over the remaining sponge roll slices, line the side of the bowl with
the slices, and pour in the custard, spreading it to let it seep down
around the sided and bottom. Chill the trifle for at least 2 hours
and up to 24 hours.

Just before serving, in a bowl with an electric mixer, beat the cream
until it is stiff.  Transfer it to a pastry bag, fitted with a
decorative tip and pipe rosettes around the edge and in the center of
the trifle. Sprinkle pistachios over the trifle and garnish the
rosettes with the citron and small drops of jam.

Second Day Apple Squares

deserts

2 cup white flour, unbleached
2 cup brown sugar, firmly packed
1/2 cup butter (or margarine)
1 cup chopped nuts (optional)
2 teaspoon cinnamon (or less)
1 teaspoon soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup sour cream (or yogurt)
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1  egg
2 cup apples, peeled and finely chopped (; about 2 apples)

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a large bowl, combine the flour, brown
sugar and margarine.  Blend at low speed, until the mixture forms fine
crumbs. If you want to include them, stir in the nuts now. Place about 2
3/4 cups of the crumb mixture into an ungreased pan, about 13 x 9 inches.
Press down firmly.

Add the remaining ingredients (except for the apples) to the remaining
crumb mixture. Blend well. Stir the chopped apples into the batter. Spoon
the batter evenly over the crumb base in the pan. Bake at 350 degrees F.
for 30-40 minutes. If you use the larger pan, bake for 25-30 minutes. Cool
before cutting.  Better yet, let it wait 24 hours before cutting. Store
loosely covered.

NOTES:

*  Sugary, moist apple squares -- Try to avoid eating very many of these
squares on the day you make them, as they improve immeasurably on the
second and third day! This recipe originally came from a Pillsbury
bake-off. Yield: Makes 12-15 squares.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 40 minutes baking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

Sfogliatelle

deserts, italian

1  pastry
3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup shortening
1/2 cup melted shortening
1  ***
1  filling
1 1/2 lb ricotta
8 tablespoon confectioners sugar
3 tablespoon minced candied orange and citron pe; el
2  eggs
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1  egg white
1  melted shortening
1  confectioners sugar

Sift flour and salt and turn into bowl.  Cut in shortening with
fingers to mealy consistency.  Add enough water (approx. 1/2 c) to
hold mixture together. Dough should be not too hard or too soft
(similar to egg noodle dough).  Knead well several minutes.  Form
into ball and refrigerate for 30 minutes to enable it to lose
elasticity and roll out easily. Roll dough very thin on lightly
floured board into rectangular pice measuring about 28 x 24 inches.
Cut edges evenly, then cut into 4 pieces lengthwise, 28 x 6 inches.
Using a brush, spread melted shortening generously and evenly over
one strip, top with second strip and spread with shortening. Repeat
with the third and fourth strips, separating each strip by a layer of
shortening.  Let shortening cool and set.  Using great care, roll four
strips together, as for jelly roll, starting from shorter end. Wrap
in wax paper and refrigerate about 15 minutes. Remove wax paper and
cut ends evenly using a short thing knige.  Cut roll into 12 1/2 inch
pieces (For easier cutting, dip knife in flour before cutting dough).
Slices will resemble narrow rolls of ribbon.  Place on lightly
floured board and sprinkle lightly with flour. Gently place rolling
pin a center of slice and roll out from center toward left. Return
rolling pin to center and roll out from center toward right.  The
slice, fromerly round, will be a larger and thinger oval shape.
Gently roll again from center toward top with one stroke and from
center toward bottom with one stroke. The oval should measure about 7
1/2 inches at its longest part. Placed prepared oval on lightly
floured board, rolled side down. Proceed as above with the other
pieces, arranging finished ovals on board, side by side. Prepare
Filling: Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Drain ricotta through cheese
cloth until quite dry.  Place in bowl, stir in remaining ingredients
and blend throroughly.  Place a tb or two of ricotta mixture on lower
half of each oval, wet edges of dough with a little egg white and
fold over filling, bringing narrow edges together to form a
shell-like shape. Press edges together tightly to seal in filling.
Brush each shell with melted shortening.  Bake about 15 minutes, then
quickly brush more melted shortening over shells using light, gentle
strokes. Close oven door quickly, lower heat to 350 and bake another
20 minutes. Brush once more with shortening. Pastries will puff up
and have a beautiful golden color showing shell-like ribs or lines.
Lower heat to 250 and bake another 5 to 10 minutes.  Cool on rack.
When cold, durst with confectioners sugar.

good. Slice a banana into about fifteen pieces, wrap each piece in a
won-ton or potsticker skin, deep fry it until golden, cool and then
dust with powdered sugar.

Sharon's Buttermilk Currant Scones

biscuits, deserts

3 cup flour
1 cup buttermilk
1/3 cup sugar, plus
2 tablespoon sugar
3/4 cup currants
1 teaspoon grated orange rind, orange part, or; zest, only
2 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon heavy cream
3/4 cup butter
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

These scones have a fine, dense crumb with a little orange and
cinnamon - a delicious combination of texture and flavour.

Preheat the oven to 400F.

Use an ungreased baking sheet.

Combine the flour, 1/3 cup of the sugar, baking powder, baking soda,
and salt in a mixing bowl. Stir with a fork to mix well and aerate.
Cut the butter into the flour mixture, using a pastry blender or two
knives or working with your fingertips, until the mixture looks like
fresh crumbs. Add the buttermilk, currants, and orange rind. Mix only
until the dry ingredients are moistened.

Gather the dough into a ball and press so it holds together. Turn the
dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead lightly twelve times.
Divide the dough in two and pat each half into a circle 1/2 to 3/4
inch thick.

In a small bowl combine the cream, cinnamon, and remaining 2 tb sugar,
stirring to blend. Brush the dough with this glaze.

Cut each circle into eight scone shape pieces (circular, or wedge).
Place the scones slightly apart on the baking sheet. Bake for about
12-15 minutes, or until the tops are browned.

Serve hot.

4 oz good quality bittersweet chocolate,; chopped fine
1/2 cup brandy, maraschino liqueur or rum f; rosting:

1 oz bittersweet chocolate
1/2 cup maraschino cherries

Sponge cake:

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Grease a loaf pan.

To prepare sponge cake, beat egg whites in a large bowl until soft
peaks form. Sprinkle salt and sugar gradually over whites; continue
beating until mixture is stiff. Fold in egg yolks and vanilla and
blend well.

Sift together flour and baking powder and gradually sprinkle over egg

toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (about 35
minutes). Cool on a rack in pan for 5 minutes, then unmold and
continue to cool.

To prepare filling, combine ricotta, confectioners' sugar, candied
fruit, chocolate and liquor of choice. Refrigerate until needed.

To assemble cake, grease sides of a 3 1/2 to 4 quart straight sided
bowl or pot and line bottom with a round of tinfoil. With a serrated
knife, cut cake into 1/2 inch slices. Line bottom of bowl with a
layer of slices and then line sides with cake. Spread about 1 1/2
cups of filling on top and then set two more slices of cake on top of
filling. Continue to layer in this way two more times, ending with
remaining three or four slices of cake on top. Refrigerate for 6
hours or overnight. When ready to serve, loosen sides with knife and
invert bowl onto serving plate. Remove aluminum foil and frost.

To prepare frosting, combine whipped cream and confectioners' sugar.
Spread mixture on top and sides of cake. Shave chocolate on top of
whipped cream and decorate with cherries and pistachio nuts.

Silk Apples

chinese, deserts

3  apples
2  egg whites
2 tablespoon flour
2 tablespoon cornstarch
1  peanut oil for deep frying
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup honey
1/3 cup water
1 tablespoon peanut oil

Quite an experience to eat - the apples is still warm and soft, the
top is crunchy and icy.  Great after a wok dinner.

Peel the apples, core and cut into wedges about 1/2 inch thick. Whip
egg whites until frothy.  Add flour and cornstarch and beat into a
smooth batter. Heat the oil to 375F. Dip each apple wedge into egg
white batter, place in hot oil and try, a few at a time, until crisp
and brown. Place in a single layer on a warm service platter. Bring
remaining ingredients to a boil in a saucepan and cook to a hard ball
stage syrup; 280 F on candy thermometer.  Pour over apple wedges and
serve at once, accompanied by a large crystal bowl of water
containing lots of ice cubes. Each person picks up an apple wedge
with a fork or small tongs and dips it into the ice water to
crystallize the sugar and harden the top, which forms silk-like
threads....hence the name. Serves 6.

Snow Drifts

deserts

3/4 cup granulated sugar
3 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup boiling water
2 tablespoon nonfat egg substitute, equivalent t; o 1/2 egg
1 teaspoon butter
1 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest
2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
6  filo dough sheets, thawed according; to package directions
1  butter-flavored, non-stick cooking; spray
1  powdered sugar

The flaky texture of filo dough combined with a creamy lemon curd
filling makes a great-tasting, low-fat dessert. Rather than using
butter, spray the sheets of filo dough with butter-flavored,
non-stick cooking spray to keep the fat content low. The lemon curd
contains almost no fat. Only a small amount of nonfat egg substitute
and one teaspoon of butter were added to the filling for flavor.

Combine granulated sugar, cornstarch and salt in medium saucepan.
Stir in boiling water until blended. Heat, stirring constantly, to
boiling. Heat and stir until thickened and clear, about 1 minute. Add
some hot cornstarch mixture to egg substitute, stirring until blended.

Return all ingredients to saucepan. Heat and stir over low heat until
slightly thickened, being careful not to curdle mixture. Stir in
butter until melted. Stir in lemon zest and juice. Let cool to room
temperature, then chill.

Place one sheet of filo on cutting board. Spray evenly with
butter-flavored cooking spray. Repeat layering with second and third
sheets of filo dough. Cut stacked sheets into eight strips
lengthwise. Cut strips in half crosswise to make 16. Arrange one
strip of file sheets into each of 16 mini-muffin cups to form nest
shape. Repeat with remaining three sheets filo dough.

Bake at 350'F. 5-7 minutes or until golden brown. Remove to wire rack
to cool.

Dust filo cups with powdered sugar. Fill with lemon curd. Makes 32.

Souffleed Cherry Soup (Soupe De Cerise Souffl

deserts

      ----CHERRY 'SOUP----
1 kg black cherries (2 1/4 lb),  stoned,; weighing 400 g  (14 oz)
30 gm unsalted butter (1 oz)
60 gm sugar (2 oz)
1  kirsch
      ----SOUFFLE----
1 single egg yolk
2 single egg whites
70 gm sugar (2 1/2 oz)
1 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice

By 'soup' Fredy Girardet means what many peoples would call a compote.

One day in advance, put 400 g (14 oz) stoned cherries into a frying
pan with the butter. Cook them gently until the juice runs. Add the
sugar and continue cooking until the sugar slightly caramelises. At
this point, pour in a generous dash of kirsch and flambe it. Take the
pan off the stove.

Put the cherries into a strainer to drain them, and keep the juice.

Just before serving, pre-heat the oven to 260 oC (500 oF).

Divide the cherries between four little souffle dishes 6 cm (2 3/8
in) in diameter and just cover them with their juice.

Prepare the souffle mixture. Put the egg yolk into a basin with 35 g
(1 1/4 oz) sugar. Beat it until it becomes pale and fluffy. Add half
a tablespoon of lemon juice.

In another basin, whisk the egg whites to firm peaks with the rest of
the sugar, then fold in a tablespoonof lemon juice. Fold the whites
delicately into the yolk mixture using a spatula.

Top up the moulds with the souffle mixture.

Southern Poached Pears With Gentlemen Jack Sa

deserts

8  pears with stems(bartlett)
1/4 cup brown sugar, dark, packed
1/4 cup gentleman jack rare whiskey
3/4 cup vanilla ice milk
1  mint leaves for garnish
1  strawberries, sliced (opt)

Servings: 6

Carefully peel pears, leaving stems intact.  Place in pot or saucepan
large enough to hold all 8 pears and cover with water. Add brown
sugar and slowly bring to a boil. Reudce heat and simmer about 8 to
10 minutes or until pears can be easily pierced with a fork.  Do not
overcook or they will become mushy.  Remove from heat and allow to
cool in the poaching liquid. Cover and refrigerate several hours or
overnight.

Remove pears from liquid, reserving liquid.  Place liquid on the
stove, bring to a boil and boil until liquid is reduced in volume to
1 cup. When reduced, set aside and allow to cool.

While liquid is reducing, halve the pears lengthwise, leaving the
stems attached to one half of each pear. Carefully remove the core of
each pear half, taking care to leave pears intact. Set the six most
attractive pear halves with stems attached and their "mates" aside.

Remove the stems from the two remaining pear halves and place with
their two mates in a blender container. Pour the reduced poaching
liquid and Gentleman Jack Rare Tennessee Whiskey into the container
with the pears and puree until smooth.  Makes about 2 cups puree. (At
this point the pear halves and puree can be covered and refrigerated
until ready to serve.)

To serve, divide half of the puree equally among each of six plates,
pouring a little sauce on the bottom of each plate. Place a pear half
with stem attached, cavity side down, on each plate on top of puree.
With a sharp knife, starting about 1/2-inch from the stem end,
carefully make slices in the pear half all the way through the
opposite end and about 1/4 inch apart. Fan the slices apart by
pressing gently on them until the ends separate slightly.

Place remaining pear halves without stems, cavity side up, next to
each fanned pear half.  Fill cavity with a 1-ounce (2 tablespoon)
scoop of ice milk.  Place a mint leaf beside each pear stem for
garnish. Add a few slices of strawberry for color, if desired.

2 cup milk
1  piece vanilla bean
1 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon chopped marachino cherries
1 tablespoon shredded candied orange peel
1 tablespoon slivered blanched almonds

In a saucepan beat 5 egg yolks and 3/4 cup sugar until the mixture is

to be molded easily.

Whip 1 cup heavy cream until it is stiff, fold in 1/4 cup sugar and 1
tablespoon each of chopped marachino cherries, shredded candied orange
peel, and slivered blanched almonds and chill the mixture.

Chill a 1-quart jelly or spumoni mold and line the inside of the mold

Stark Mary Jane

candy, misc, spices

1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup light corn syrup
1/2 cup water
3 tablespoon molasses
1  egg white
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/4 cup powdered sugar
1  cornstarch for dusting

1.  Combine the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a saucepan over medium
heat. 2. Heat stirring, until the sugar begins to boil, then continue
to cook, using a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature. 3.
When the sugar reaches 240F degrees, or the soft-ball stage, beat the
egg white in a microwave-safe bowl until it is tiff and forms peaks.
Divide the beaten egg white, and throw out half. (You only need 1/2
egg white for this recipe, and it is easier to divide when beaten.)
4. When the sugar reaches 265F degrees, or the hard-ball stage, stir
in the molasses, then pour the mixture in thin streams into the egg
white while beating with an electric mixer on low speed. 5. Beat for
3 to 4 minutes and then pour half the mixture into a 9x9-inch greased
pan and let it firm up in the refrigerator for 5 to 10 minutes. 6.
Combine the peanut butter and powdered sugar. 7. When the candy is
firm, spread a thin layer of the peanut butter mixture on top. 8.
Microwave the remaining candy mixture for 1 minute on high, or until
it becomes soft again. 9. Pour the softened candy over the peanut
butter layer. 10. When the candy is cool but still pliable, (about 20
minutes later)  turn it out onto a surface dusted lightly with
cornstarch. Use a  cornstarch-dusted rolling pin to roll the candy
about 1/4-inch thick. 11. Use kitchen scissors or a sharp knife to
cut the candy into 1 1/2 x 1/2-inch rectangles. Makes 30 candies.

Steamed Bread Pudding

deserts

1 cup brown sugar
2 cup milk
1/2 cup seedless raisins
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
5  thin slices good-quality white brea; d
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup (1/2 sticks) butter, softened
3  eggs

In the top of an oiled double boiler, mix the brown sugar and raisins.
Remove crusts from bread, butter the slices on one side, and then cut
them into 1/2 inch cubes; you should have about 2 cups. Place the
cubes on top of the brown-sugar mixture.

In a medium bowl, beat the eggs lightly, then add the remaining
ingredients--just blend, don't overmix. Pour the egg mixture over the
bread cubes, but do not stir in. Cook, covered, over simmering water,
for about 1 hour and 20- minutes.  A knife inserted in the center
should come out fairly clean. (Pudding will continue cooking after
taken out of pan, so don't worry if it is still a bit shaky at the
end of the cooking time.)

Immediately loosen the edges of the pudding with a rubber spatula and
invert onto a 12 inch round platter with a lip. Arrange any stray
raisins decoratively around the edge of the platter. Serve warm.

Stephanie Ramsey's Cinnabon Rolls

breads, deserts

1/2 cup warm water (105-110 degrees)
2 pkg active dry yeast
2 tablespoon granulated sugar
3 1/2 oz pkg instant vanilla pudding
1/2 cup butter, melted
2  eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon salt
8 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup butter, melted
      ----CINNABON TOPPING----
2 cup brown sugar, firmly packed
4 teaspoon cinnamon
      ----OR* CREAM CHEESE FROSTING----
8 oz cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 teaspoon vanilla
3 cup powdered sugar
1 tablespoon milk, just enough to fluff
      ----OR* STICKY BUNS & TOPPING----
1 cup butter
1 cup brown sugar
9 tablespoon light corn syrup
1 cup pecans or walnuts,  coarsely choppe; d

BUNS:In small bowl, combine water, yeast and sugar. Stir until
dissolved. Set aside. In large bowl, make pudding mix according to
package directions. Add butter, eggs and salt; mix well. Add the
yeast mixture; blend. Gradually add flour and knead until smooth,
adding "sprinkles" of flour as needed to control stickiness. Once the
dough is no longer sticky and is soft and silky feeling (like as
baby's behind), the dough is ready. Place in very large greased bowl.
Cover and let rise until double in bulk (about 1 hour). Punch down
and let rise again (about 45 minutes). On a lightly floured surface,
roll out to a 34" x 21" rectangle. Spread 1 cup of melted butter over
surface. CINNABON TOPPING: In small bowl, mix brown sugar and
cinnamon together. Sprinkle all over top of surface. Roll up very
tightly. With a knife, put a notch every 2 inches. With string or
thread, place under roll by notch and criss-cross over to cut roll
(makes a nice clean cut). Place on greased baking pan, 2-inches
apart. Lightly press rolls down with your hands (just a LITTLE, it
helps to hold them together better). Cover and let rise until double
again. Bake at 350-degrees for 15 to 20 minutes. Take them out when
they JUST start to turn golden. DON'T OVER-BAKE!  Frost warm rolls
with Cream Cheese Frosting. CREAM CHEESE FROSTING: Combine all
ingredients and mix until smooth. Spread on very warm rolls. Rolls
are best when served warm. CARAMEL STICKY BUNS & TOPPING: In a sauce
pan or in your microwave oven combine butter, brown sugar and corn
syrup.  Heat and stir until blended. Pour topping into the bottom of
the pan (pans) you are using for the rolls, place unbaked cinnamon
rolls on top on the caramel sauce. Allow to rise in a warm place
until double in size (about 1 hour). Preheat oven to 350-degrees.
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until lightly brown. After removing pans
from oven, cover with foil; invert onto cooling racks, cool 1 minute,
and remove pan. Cool before serving.

Stewed Fruits

crockpot, deserts, fruits

1 lb prunes; pitted
8 oz dried apricots
8 oz dried pears
3 cup ; water
1/2 cup sugar
1/2  vanilla bean
2  lemon zest strips, 2 each
2 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice

Stir all ingredients together in a large heavy saucepan. Bring the
liquid to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to as
low as possible and cook, covered, until the fruit is softened and
tender, 2 hours. Stir the fruits occasionally while they cook.

If you have a crockpot, stir all the ingredients together in it and
cook until the fruit is tender, 6 to 8 hours.

Serve the fruit warm or at room temperature.

Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

Loomis says that the crockpot method is preferable, for depth of
flavor. She suggests serving this as brunch by itself, over waffles
or pancakes, or for dessert over vanilla or cinnamon ice cream. Or,
eat this on its own for a sweet snack.

Sticky Date Pudding

deserts

      ----PUDDING----
380 gm stoneless dates
500 ml water
380 gm sugar
380 gm selfraising flour
2 teaspoon bicarb of soda
125 gm butter, melted
4 large egg yolks
1/2 teaspoon vanilla essence
      ----SAUCE----
300 gm brown sugar
300 ml cream
125 gm butter
1  vanilla essence to taste

Combine the dates and the water in a saucepan and bring to boil.
Reduce heat and simmer until the dates have reduced to a jam-like
consistancy.
In a separate bowl, combine the flour, sugar, bicarb of soda, melted
butter, egg yolks and beat to a smooth batter.
Preheat the oven to 185xC. Grease eight dariole moulds or other
suitable containers (or one large baking dish). Stand the moulds or
dish in an oven tray containing 3cm of warm water.
Stir the dates into the batter and pour at once into the moulds or
dish. Place in the oven and bake for about 1 hour or until a skewer
inserted into the centre comes out clean.
Remove from the oven and let stand for a minute or two, then invert

Strawberries With Orange Champagne Sabayon

deserts

1/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon sugar
3  egg yolk
1 1/2 teaspoon orange peel, grated
1/2 cup champagne, dry
1/4 cup whipping cream, chilled
2 tablespoon whipping cream, chilled
1 1/2 teaspoon liqueur, grand marnier
1 1/2 pint strawberries, fresh, hulled & halve; d
1  mint leaf, fresh

Servings:   4

**other sparkling wine may be substituted for the Champagne.

My notes:  The egg yolk mixture didn't get thick enough (using large
eggs), so next time I plan to increase the amount to 4 yolks.

Whisk sugar, egg yolks and orange peel in a medium metal bowl until
pale yellow and thick, about 3 minutes. Set bowl over saucepan of
simmering water. Add Champagne to yolk mixture and whisk until
mixture is doubled in volume and holds shape on spoon, about 5
minutes. Remove bowl from over water. Set over another bowl filled
with ice. Cool completely, whisking occasionally.

Using electric mixer, beat cream with Grand Marnier in small bowl
until almost stiff. Fold cream and Grand Marnier into sabayon. (Can
be prepared 8 hours ahead. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.)

Preheat broiler. Divide strawberries among 4 shallow broilerproof
bowls or gratin dishes. Spoon sabayon over. Broil until light brown,
about 2 minutes. Garnish with mint and serve.

2  eggs
2 tablespoon evaporated milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla
1 1/4 cup flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1 lb fresh strawberries (or more)
3 tablespoon sugar
1 pkg red transparent glaze

In small bowl, mix margarine, sugar and eggs until creamy. Add
evaporated milk and vanilla.

In another bowl, sift flour and baking powder together. Stir into
margarine mixture in small amounts.

Grease a 12 inch fruit flan tin with a fluted rim. Sprinkle with
flour. Pour in mixture and spread evenly with a knife.

Bake at 350 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden
brown. Let cool for 10 minutes after removing from oven.

Drain strawberries; reserve juice. Turn cake upside down and fill with
strawberries. (If strawberries are very large, you may want to slice
them in half. Sprinkle with sugar and allow to sit for 1 hour.) Add
the strawberry juice to the glaze mix. Prepare glaze, following
instructions on back of package. (NOTE: If you have accumulated
approximately 1/2 cup of juice from the strawberries, and the glaze
mix requires 1 cup of water, use the 1/2 cup of juice plus 1/2 cup of
water to make 1 cup of liquid.) Pour glaze over strawberries.

Strawberry Lemon Trifle

deserts, fruits/nuts

      ----GENOISE LAYER----
4 large eggs
1 pinch salt
2/3 cup sugar
1/2 cup cake flour
3 tablespoon cornstarch
      ----LEMON FILLING----
3/4 cup lemon juice
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup butter
6  egg yolks
1 1/4 cup whipping cream
      ----STRAWBERRY SYRUP----
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup sugar
1 pint strawberries
2 tablespoon kirsch
1 cup toasted sliced almonds
2 pint strawberries
1 cup whipping cream  for finishing

FOR THE GENOISE: Preheat oven to 350F. Break the eggs into the bowl
of an electric mixer and whisk in salt, then sugar. Place the bowl
over a pan of simmering water and whisk until just lukewarm. Whip by
machine until cold and increased in volume, about 4-to-5 minutes. Mix
cake flour and cornstarch. Sift over egg foam in 3 or 4 additions,
folding it in with a rubber spatula. Pour the batter into a buttered,
paper-lined 10-inch round pan and level it off. Bake the Genoise
layer about 30 minutes until it is well risen, golden and beginning
to shrink away from sides. Unmold immediately and cool on a rack.
Bake and cool the Genoise layer. FOR THE LEMON FILLING: Combine lemon
juice, sugar and butter in a non-reactive saucepan. Bring to a boil
over low heat. Whisk yolks in a bowl and whisk in 1/3 mixture. Return
remaining lemon mixture to a boil over low heat and whisk in yolk
mixture. Continue cooking several minutes, whisking constantly, until
thickened and just at a boil. Pour into a bowl, press plastic wrap
against surface and chill. Immediately before using, whip cream and
fold into lemon curd. FOR THE STRAWBERRY SYRUP: Combine water and
sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Rinse, hull and puree
strawberries. Add puree and kirsch to syrup off the heat. Strain and
chill. To assemble, rinse remaining berries and reserve six for a
decoration. Hull and slice remaining berries. Cut Genoise into thin
vertical slices. Place a layer of cake slices in a glass serving
bowl. Moisten cake with syrup and strew with 1/4 each of the sliced
berries, almonds and jam. Spread with 1/4 of the lemon filling.
Repeat with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of cake slices
and syrup. Whip remaining cream and spread half on the trifle.
Decorate border with remaining cream (pipe with a star tube) and
reserved strawberries. Chill until serving time.

Strawberry Meringue Pudding

australian, deserts

1  text only

This is an Australian recipe circa 1950 (cakes and puddings always
were Australia's forte) which deserves a revival. At the time, most
homes always had a supply of cake and biscuits on hand, so cake and
biscuit crumbs were a by-product which needed a use. Nowadays you
will probably have to buy a plain cake to obtain the crumbs. The
recipe is hardly for weight-watchers but, even so, is quite low in
fat.

Preheat the oven to 190C.  Hull 3 cupfuls of strawberries and slice
them into an oven dish.  Sift over them half a cup of icing sugar.
Heat one cup of milk. Separate 2 eggs, beat the yolks and stir into
the milk off the heat.  Add 1 cup of cake or sweet biscuit crumbs and
spread the mixture over the strawberries. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes.

Meanwhile beat the 2 egg whites until stiff then fold in 4
tablespoons of castor sugar.  Remove the pudding from the oven and
pile this meringue on top of it in peaks, or swirls.

Bake in a slow (130C) oven for 15 to 20 minutes.

Makes 6 servings.

1/2 cup + 2 tbs. sugar; divided
2 tablespoon orange liqueur; optional
1 each orange; grated zest of
1 each env. unflavored gelatin
1 1/4 cup heavy cream; divided
      ----GARNISHES----

minutes. Slowly whisk gelatin mixture into strawberry puree.

With mixer at high speed, beat cream until soft peaks form. Fold 1/4
of whipped cream into strawberry mixture until well conbined., Gently
fold in remaining whipped cream. Line 5 cup bowl or mold with plastic
wrap. Pour in mousse. Chill until firm, about 2 hours.

Tips: To make the cream extra fluffy, chill the cream, mixing bowl and
beaters for at least 3 hours before beating.

Make sure that the orange juice mixture and strawberry puree is at
about the same temperature, so it will combine more easily; (no
lumps). SLOWLY whisk juice mixture into puree.

Strawberry Souffle With Orange Sauce

deserts, fruits/nuts, low cal

      ----SOUFFLE BATTER----
2 pint strawberries
1/4 cup water
3/4 cup sugar
6 large egg whites
1 pinch salt
1  vegetable cooking spray
1  sugar; for greasing mold
      ----STRAWBERRYORANGE SAUCE----
1 pint strawberries
2 tablespoon sugar
3 tablespoon orange juice
1 tablespoon orange liqueur  such as cointreau

FOR THE SOUFFLE: Rinse, hull and puree the berries. Puree the berries
in a blender or food processor. Measure 2 cups puree. (Use any
remaining puree for the sauce.) Combine water and sugar in a 2-quart
saucepan and bring to a boil over low heat. Cook until the syrup
thickens, about 3 minutes. Increase heat and add puree, stirring to
dissolve any sugar which may have hardened when the puree was added.
Bring to a boil and cool. Thirty minutes before serving the souffle,
preheat the oven to 400F and set a rack in the lower part of the
oven. Spray a 2 1/2-quart oval gratin dish or rectangular glass
baking dish with vegetable cooking spray and sprinkle the inside of
the dish with sugar. Whip the egg whites with the salt until they
hold a soft peak. Fold in the cooled strawberry puree. Pour the
souffle batter into the dish and smooth the top of the batter with a
metal spatula. Bake about 15 minutes, until well risen and lightly
colored. Serve immediately. FOR THE STRAWBERRY-ORANGE SAUCE: While
the souffle is baking, combine the sauce ingredients in the blender
(adding any leftover puree) and puree. Place in saucepan and bring to
a boil and reduce for a minute or 2. Serve with the souffle. Vary
this souffle with other fruit or berries--use 2 cups of pureed,
strained fruit as a substitute for the strawberries.

about 8 big stawberries for decoration and slice the rest. Fold
sliced stawberries into the whipped cream. Skim off the hard top of
the center of the meringue. Fill shell with the strawberry mixture.

Strawberry Trifle

deserts

1  ingredients:
10 oz angel loaf cake
1/3 cup strawberry jam or jelly
1/3 cup cream sherry or orange juice
3 cup strawberries
1  custard sauce (cf. below)
3/4 cup whipping cream
2 tablespoon powdered sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoon sliced almonds, toasted (optional)
3  egg yolks

CUSTARD SAUCE:

Mix 1-1/2 tbsp. corstarch with 1/2 cup milk.  Heat 1-3/4 cups of milk
with 1/4 cup of sugar in a heavy saucepan or double boiler, just to
the point of boiling.  Remove from the heat.  Stir in the cornstarch
mixture until it's smooth.  The cornstarch mixes better and without
lumps if the milk is bone-chilling COLD.

Cook, stirring constantly, until it thickens. It will thicken *fast*,
so pay attention.  Simmer for three minutes and remove from the heat.
Beat in 1 tsp. vanilla extract and 3 beaten egg yolks. Cover and
chill.

THE TRIFLE:

Split the angel loaf cake into 3 layers.  Spread the jam between the
layers and reassemble the layers.  Cut the cake into 2-inch cubes.
Arrange the cubes in a 2-quart serving bowl and sprinkle with the
sherry or orange juice.  Wash the strawberries and pick out 8 to 12
berries for later garnishing.  Remove the hulls from the rest of the
berries and slice. Spoon the berries over the cake.

Pour the chilled Custard Sauce over the berries. Cover the mixture and
refrigerate for an hour or more. Meanwhile, whip the cream to soft
peaks. Add the sugar and vanilla and whip until it forms *stiff*
peaks. Spread the cream over the custard.

Garnish the top with whole strawberries (the green hulls against the
red and white background is particularly pleasing to the eye).
Sprinkle the entire thing with the almonds, if you have them. Chill
and serve within a few hours.

Don't try to save this too long. It will get soggy before long and the
strawberries will get mushy.  So eat it all at once.

(TIP):   Make the Custard Sauce first. Cover and refrigerate it until
it's ready for use.

Strawberry-Rhubarb Compote

deserts

3 cup chopped rhubarb (green or
1  pink, it doesnt matter)
1 cup chopped strawberries
1/4 cup (or so) sugar
1/2 cup (or so) water

In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine rhubarb, sugar and water. Bring
to simmer, then turn heat very low. Cook without stirring for several
hours. When the rhubarb is very soft, add the strawberries and cook
for another hour or so. Stir gently. Add more sugar if needed.

The ratio of rhubarb to berries is flexible.  Im sure you can prepare
this recipe faster, but Im told rhubarb likes to stew slowly
(macerate?). I start a batch on Saturday, when Im generally in and
out of the kitchen anyway. I like the compote warm or cold. If youre
feeling decadent, its good over ff ice cream or baked goods.

Strudel Dough

deserts, ethnic

1  *ingredients*
2 cup flour
1  1tbls.      butter or margerine
1/4 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup water, lukewarm
1  whole egg

Source: Treasured Slovenian & International Recipes

*DIRECTIONS* Mix flour, butter, egg and salt. Add lukewarm water and
mix. Place on a board and knead for 10 minutes or more; or you may
toss and beat dough on the board for about 15 minutes. The more you
beat the dough the better the dough will be to work with. Place in a
greased bowl. Cover and let rest for at least one hour.

*HOW TO STRETCH STRUDEL DOUGH* Spread table with a cloth large enough
to hang over the sides. Sprinkle lightly with flour and place dough
in the center. With a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough to make
an 18 inch circle. Slide hand gently below circle of dough and let
the dough rest on the back of your hands with your palms down. Now
pull the center of the dough gently toward you. Stretch and pull the
dough as you walk slowly around the table. Dough should be thin as
tissue paper. Then tear or cut off the thick outer edges, leaving
about two inches of dough hanging over the sides of the table. Now
proceed to spread on the desired filling immediately. Roll up gently
by lifting the cloth and place your strudel in a well greased baking
pan to bake.

(You can also use this recipe for struklje)

*VARIATIONS* The only difference is that Grandma uses a large
cast-iron skillet to bake these. She says that you get a better crust
this way. Because of the skillet, once you roll up the strudel (like
a jelly roll) you must curl the strudel into a spiral shape to fit
into the skillet.

Strudel Dough***Cmkd93f

deserts, ethnic, jewish

4 cup flour, (preferably bread flo
2 teaspoon salt
2 each large eggs
2 1/2 cup water
8 tablespoon butter (unsalted), melted
1 teaspoon white vinegar or lemon juice
1 single strained (optional)

Sift the flour and salt onto a board or into a large bowl. Make a
well in the center. Lightly beat the eggs with a fork, then beat in
the water and half of the melted butter. Add the vinegar or lemon
juice, if desired. Pour the egg mixture into the well in the flour.
Stir until all of the flour is incorporated into the egg mixture and
the dough is smooth. On a floured board, knead the dough for at LEAST
10 minutes; or until it is smooth, shiny and blistered on the
surface. Brush the dough generously with melted butter, place it in a
bowl, cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.
Cover a large table completely with a floured cloth. Place the dough
in the center of the cloth and, working in all directions, roll out
the dough as thin as possible. Spread a little melted butter over the
dough, and stretch it with your hands--CAREFULLY working all around
the table to avoid tearing the dough--until it is very thin and almost
transparent. As you stretch, brush the dough with more butter as
necessary. Cut off any thick edges, then let the dough rest for about
15 minutes before using it. NOTE: The 2 lbs of dough produced by this
recipe can be stretched into a sheet about 6 feet square--enough for
two 3-foot strudels. Any excess dough can be       restretched. With
practice in stretching the dough,       you may be able to make a
6-foot square out of 1 pound of dough.
GOOD LUCK!!!

3/4 cup ricotta cheese
1 drop pure almond extract
2/3 cup chopped blanched almonds - (finely; chopped)
1/2 cup heavy cream; stiffly whipped

extract. Toast the chopped almonds in a hot oven or under a broiler,
watching carefully to make sure they do not burn. Leave them to cool.
Fold the whipped cream into the cheese mixture and add the toasted
almonds. Taste and adjust sweetening and flavoring, if desired. Take
small spoonfuls of the mixture and stuff each flower. Arrange the
flowers on a serving plate. Serve as a dessert or afternoon snack

1 teaspoon grated lemon rind
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup low-fat yogurt

Scald peaches in boiling water for 1 minute to loosen skins. Drain,

Sufganiyot

doughnuts, holiday, israeli

1/2 cup margarine
1 cup flour
1 tablespoon sugar
4  eggs
2 quart vegetable oil for frying
12 oz fruit preserves
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar

Sufganiyot are small, jelly-filled doughnuts traditionally served in
Israel during Hanukkah. The doughnuts are fried in oil, symbolizing
the miracle that occurred when one day's worth of sacred oil burned
for eight days when the Maccabees returned to their ransacked temple
in Jerusalem some 2,100 years ago.

1. Place margarine and 1 cup water in a small saucepan over
medium-high heat. Bring to a boil. Stir in flour and sugar. Cook,
stirring vigorously, just until mixture forms a ball. Remove from
heat.

2. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Stir until smooth and well-blended.

3. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over high heat until it reaches 380
degrees as measured on a deep-fat frying thermometer. Adjust heat
while making pastries to maintain the 380-degree temperature.

4. Carefully drop batter by slightly rounded tablespoonfuls into hot
oil. Fry until puffed and golden brown on all sides, about 2 minutes.

5. Using a slotted spoon, remove from oil and drain on paper towels.
Remove to wire racks to cool completely.

6. Fill a pastry bag, fitted with a filling tip, with preserves.
Insert tip into each doughnut and squeeze about 1/2 tablespoon of
filling into each.

7. Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve. Sufganiyot do not store
well, so are best eaten the day they are made.

Sugar Eggs

candy

1  egg-shaped mold
1 pkg granulated sugar
1  water
1  food coloring
1  icing

1. Mix a little water with the granulated sugar to make it wet enough
to pack. Scoop the wet sugar into each half of plastic egg mold.

2. Stiffly turn filled egg mold upside-down on several layers on paper
towel and remove egg mold.

3. Using a spoon, scoop out a half circle from one side of each sugar
egg, making sure that when the two sides are put together, the
scooped out sections will match. If you want your sugar egg to stand
you will want to cut away the bottom end of the sugar egg. Let dry
overnight or until surface of sugar eggs are hard.

4. When outer side of sugar eggs are hard, turn and scoop out inside
leaving the shell to measure about 1/4" in thickness.

5. Seam together the two egg halves using cake icing. Decorate around
seam and around hole opening to conceal rough edges. Finish
decorating sugar eggs and fill with your favorite candies.

Optional:

* Color water with food coloring before mixing with sugar.

* Use cake decorating confections for decorating.

* Soak shredded coconut in green food coloring for grass.

Summer Blueberry Tart (Tarte Aux Myrtilles D'

deserts, french

      ----PATE BRISEE----
1 1/2 cup unbleached white flour
2 tablespoon sugar
1/2 cup butter; chilled - cut into small
1  egg yolk
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice cold water, more; if needed
      ----FILLING----
5 cup fresh or frozen blueberries water
1/3 cup sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch; dissolved in: water
      ----OPTIONAL----
1/2 pint heavy cream; whipped

FOR THE PATE BRISEE, stir the flour and sugar together in a mixing
bowl. Cut the chilled butter into small pieces and drop into the
flour. With your fingers, lightly and quickly rub the butter and
flour together until the mixture becomes crumbly, or cut it in with a
knife or pastry cutter. Whisk together the egg yolk, lemon juice, and
1 tablespoon of water. Sprinkle the liquid over the butter-flour
mixture and continue to stir or rub this mixture between your fingers
until a ball of dough forms. Be careful not to overwork the dough. If
the mixture is crumbly, add up to one more tablespoon water,
sprinkling it over the dough and lightly kneading it into a ball. On
a floured board and with a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough
into a large circle. Gently lift it into a 9- or 10-inch pie plate or
tart tin. Patch any holes in the crust with bits of dough and trim
the edges. Flute the crust. Chill for 2 hours. Preheat the oven to
375 F. Place a sheet of aluminum foil in the bottom of the crust and
fill it with dried beans or rice to weigh it down during baking. Bake
for 15 minutes. Remove the crust from the oven and carefully lift out
the foil and beans. Bake for 5 minutes more. Cool. TO MAKE THE
FILLING, heat in a small saucepan 2 cups of the blueberries, 2
tablespoons of water, and the sugar. Crush a few berries with a spoon
to release the juice. When the berries have softened and become
juicy, add the cornstarch mixture. Simmer on low heat for about 10
minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens. Remove it
from the heat and fold in one more cup of blueberries. Pour the berry
mixture into the baked pie shell. Top with remaining 2 cups
blueberries. Cool for at least one hour. Serve plain or topped with
fresh whipped cream, if desired, or sweetened Crme Frache.

Sunbeam Tapioca

deserts, low fat

3 tablespoon instant tapioca
1 cup pineapple juice
1 cup orange juice
1 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 cup mandarin orange sections - (canned); , drained
1 cup canned pineapple - (crushed or tidb; its), - drained

Combine the instant tapioca, pineapple juice, and orange juice in a
saucepan.  Cook and stir over medium heat until the mixture comes to a
boil.  Remove from heat; add the lemon juice. Cool, stirring
occasionally. Add the fruit and chill until firm.

HINTS: I used the 'packed in their own juices' tinned fruit, and so
used the juice from the tins plus some water and OJ to make up the
difference.

Sunkhaya - Thai Coconut Custard.

deserts, thai

1 cup coconut milk
3/4 cup palm sugar
1/2 cup sugar
4 each eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)

Put coconut milk in a medium size bowl.  Add all ingredients and whisk
lightly until all ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Note:
Traditionally, the mixing is done by hand mixing everything together
and crushing in pieces of banana leave, or the leave of an aromatic
plant (bai-tey). The leaves are then picked out and discarded. Here,
vanilla extract is used in place of the aromatic "bai-tey". The aroma
is not the same, but they both will serve to hide the "raw" taste of
the eggs. Divide the mixture into suitable containers and steam for
approximately 30 to 45 minutes. Suitable container may be simply
glass bowls, or hollowed out small pumpkins, or young "green" coconut
with the top of the shell removed.

Svingi (Batter Puffs With Honey & Cinnamon)

deserts

1 cup boiling water
4 tablespoon butter or margarine
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon grated orange rind
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
4  eggs
1  olive or other vegetable oil
1  honey; warmed
1  ground cinnamon

In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the boiling water, butter, salt,
sugar, and orange rind.  Bring to a boil. Meanwhile, sift together
the flour and baking powder. Add the dry ingredients all at once to
the hot mixture, beating hard with a wooden spoon over medium heat
until the mixture forms a compact mass and leaves the sides of the
pan. Remove from the heat and let cool for 1 minute.  Add the eggs,
one at a time, beating hard after each addition; the mixture should
be smooth, glossy, and thick. Heat the oil (which should be 2-1/2 to
3 inches deep) almost to the smoking point, then drop the batter by
tablespoons into the oil, without crowding, to form puffs.  When the
puffs surface, turn them to fry on all sides, using tongs, then lift
them out, drain off excess oil on absorbent paper. Place on warm
platter and keep warm. If using the syrup, boil the syrup ingedients
for 5 minutes; spoon the syrup, or warm honey, over the puffs,
sprinkle with cinnamon, and serve hot.

Swedish Coffee Ring / Swedish Christmas Crown - Abm

abm, brunch

      ----DOUGH----
3/4 cup water
2 large eggs
1/4 cup butter, softened
1 pinch saffron* or 2-3drops yellow
1  food coloring
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
4 cup bread flour
1/3 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon salt
4 teaspoon bread machine yeast
1/3 cup chopped citron
1/4 cup chopped blanched almonds
3 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1  green & red candied cherries
      ----GLAZE----
1/2 cup 10x lemon flavored sugar
1/2 cup 10x sugar - plain flavor
1 tablespoon water + as needed

Place all the dough ingredients in the bread machine pan in the order
recommended by the manufacturer, EXCEPT the citron, almonds and lemon
peel.

Process on Dough/Manual cycle. DO NOT USE THE DELAY CYCLE. According
to your machine add the citron, almonds and lemon peel at the raisin
or nuts signal beep or 5 minutes before last kneading cycle ends.

Grease a large cookie sheet. (I prefer the air-cushion type as it
doesn't over brown the bottom of the bread.)

Divide dough in half. Roll each half into a 30-inch rope on a lightly
floured pastry board. Place ropes close together on the prepared
cookie sheet. Twist the ropes over each other gently and then loosely
into a circle. Press the ends together to seal. Cover and allow to
rise in a warm place 45-50 minutes or until double in size.

Heat oven to 375 degrees F . Bake ring 20-25 minutes or until golden
brown; cool. Drizzle with Glaze. Garnish with cherries if desired.

Glaze: With a fork blend the sugars together. All of one flavor can
be used if desired.  Add water and mix until smooth and thin enough
to drizzle over the cake. Add or decrease water accordingly.

*To make a SWEDISH CHRISTMAS CROWN: After bread has cooled, make
holes for 6 candles in bread. Drizzle with glaze. Garnish with
cherries and insert candles.

Swedish Nuts

christmas, deserts

1/2 cup butter, unsalted
2 large eggs, whites only
1 pinch salt
1 cup sugar, granulated
1 quart pecan halves
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, ground

Set aside stick of butter to melt in a long pan. (Don't use a pan
that has depressions around the side, such as for lasagna.) Preheat
oven to 300 degrees.

Separate eggs; sprinkle a pinch of salt onto the egg whites. (You can
reserve the yolks to make custards.) Beat the whites to form soft
peaks. Gradually add the sugar, cinnamon and vanilla extract. Fold in
pecan halves.

Turn out pecans and spread OVER the melted butter (don't stir them
in). Cook for 15 minutes.  Take out the pan and stir the nuts. Cook
another 10 minutes, take out and stir. Repeat until the nuts are
separated and all the butter is absorbed (a little over one hour).

BE PATIENT!!!  For a long time it will look totally disgusting and
you will be sure I gave you a bogus recipe, but it works!
Theoretically you can use other nuts, but I've tried both almonds and
walnuts and was disappointed...

Sweet Almond Pudding With Dates

chinese, deserts

1/3 cup sweet rice flour
2 tablespoon + 2 t almond powder
1/2 cup cold water
3 cup cold milk
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup sliced pitted red dates
3 tablespoon cold milk, if needed

In small bowl, mix rice flour & almond powder; add cold water a
little at a time to make a thick, smooth paste. Thin further with 1/2
cup of milk. Pour into heavy saucepan, add remaining milk, and slowly
heat to just under boiling, stirring constantly.  Keep stirring to
prevent lumping & burning. Turn off heat, cover & remove to cool
place. You can prepare this first stage anytime ahead of dinner, keep
covered & refrigerated. Pudding should be finished just before
serving.

Just before serving, reheat pudding, stirring constantly. When hot,
add sugar a little at a time. Keep stirring. Add sliced dates. Cook
just under boiling point for 1 minute.  Add extra milk if pudding
becomes too thick: it should have consistency of melted ice cream.
Pour into individual bowls & serve hot.

1/2 cup cold water
3 cup cold milk
1/4 cup granulated sugar

This unusual dish as a dessert, as a mid-way course in a large
dinner, or as a snack.  Pudding may be misleading, since it is really
a thick, hot soup.

Sweet Hominy Chimichangas With Fruit Purees

deserts, fruits

2 cup white hominy (about one 29 ounce ca; n), drained
4 teaspoon confectioners' sugar
2 tablespoon heavy (whipping) cream
1 pint ripe strawberries; hulled (1 basket)
2  ripe mangos
4 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon dark brown sugar
6  flour tortillas

1.  In a food processor, blender, or food mill, puree the hominy.
Stir in the confectioners' sugar and cream. Place about 1/3 cup of
the hominy mixture in the center of a flour tortilla. Fold up
envelope style.

2.  Wash out the food processor or other machine and puree the
strawberries.  Clean the machine again.

3.  Peel the mangos; remove the pulp from the pits. Puree the pulp.

4.  When ready to serve, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter with 1
tablespoon of the brown sugar in a large frying pan set over medium
heat. Heat until the butter foams and the sugar melts, stirring to
blend. Add 2 or 3 of the filled tortillas, depending on the size of
the pan, and fry for 1 minute. Turn and fry on the other side until
golden and slightly crisp, about 1 minute more.  Remove to a platter.
Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon brown sugar.
Continue cooking until all the chimichangas are done.

5.  Spoon strawberry puree over one end of each chimichanga; spoon
mango puree over the other.  Eat while still warm and crunchy.

Variations:  Other than strawberries and mangos, you can use apricots;
berries (boysenberry, blueberry, raspberry, mulberry); cherries;
guavas; mandarin oranges or other oranges and tangerines; pineapple;
and peaches. Fruits that are mellow (pear, apple, papaya) don't
provide the needed contrast.  The fruit puree can be embellished with
a dash of: brandy, cassis, grenadine, kirsch and Triple Sec.

Sweet Risotto With Exotic Bananas

bananas, deserts, low fat

1 cup arborio rice
3  exotic ripe bananas (about
1 1/3 lb total weight), peeled and
1  chopped
1/4 cup brown sugar
3 cup milk
1/4 cup creme de cacao liqueur
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

Sprinkle about a third of the rice in the bottom of a 2-quart
casserole dish.  Then sprinkle on a third of the bananas and a third
of the sugar on top of them. Continue sprinkling in thirds until
you're done. Pour on the milk and creme de cacao and sprinkle with
cinnamon. Cover and bake in a 375 degree pre-heated oven until the
liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender, about 1 hour.  Serve
warm.

We discovered that it also tastes good cold, standing in front of the
refrigerator :-)

You can substitute skim milk or evaporated skim milk instead of whole
milk. Also, if exotic bananas aren't available, substitute regular
ones. I used evaporated skim milk, regular bananas, and I think I
left out the liqueur. Arborio is the short-grained Italian rice
traditionally used for risotto. My regular supermarket does carry it.
Perhaps another kind of rice would work.

3 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon candied citron peel; minced
2 tablespoon pine nuts
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cup flour, unbleached salt
2  eggs
3 tablespoon oil, vegetable
2 tablespoon rum or brandy
1/2 teaspoon lemon extract

"Toward the end of our Odyssey as escapees from the Nazis, my two
brother, my sister and myself made a stop at a farm with the usual
trepidation; would they give us shelter or turn us into the Fascists?
They welcomed us. One of the their children was celebrating First
Communion and they were delighted to share the happy event with us.
In fact,as if we were part of the family, we helped in the
preparations. They had very little sugar, which they had saved from
before the war and asked us to make one of our desserts with it. It
was near Shavout and we thought of Tortelli Dolci. Some of the
ingredients were missing, but they were delicious to anyway or so it
seemed to us at the time."

Combine the citron with 1 egg yolk, 3 Tbsp sugar, citron peel, pine
nuts and vanilla extract; mix well and set aside in refrigerator.
Make a soft dough with the flour, salt, eggs, the remaining egg yolk,
1/4 cup sugar, vegetable oil, rum and lemon extract. Knead for 3
minutes, then cover with a clean towel and let rest for five minutes.
With a rolling pin, roll very thin. With a cookie cutter or with a
glass, cut into disks, about 3 inches in diameter. Place 1 Tbsp of
the ricotta mixture over each disk. Fold each disk in half and press
the round edge with a fork to seal. Place on an ungreased baking
sheet and bake in preheated oven 400F oven for 15 minutes. Serve
before the filling make the pastry become soggy. Yields about 3 Dozen

Sweet Yeast Crisps

deserts

1/3 cup warm water
1 pkg active dry yeast
1 cup lightly salted butter or margarine,; at room
1  temperature
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 cup all-purpose flour, sifted before me; asuring
3/4  to 1 cup granulated sugar

Combine the water and yeast in a small bowl; let stand for 2 minutes.
In a large mixer bowl, beat the butter and salt until creamy. Add the
flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. (This can
be done with an electric mixer at low speed.) Stir in the yeast
mixture. Cover the mixture and chill for 1 hour.

Place 3/4 cup of granulated sugar in a pie plate or shallow pan. Drop
level tablespoons of the chilled dough into the sugar. Roll each
tablespoon into a ball and coat well with sugar. Place the
sugar-coated balls in a shallow pan and chill for 30 minutes.

Heat the oven to 375F.  On a well-sugared board, working with one
ball at a time, press additional sugar into the dough while you pat
the ball into a square.  Using a sugared rolling pin, roll each piece
of dough into a square about 3 x 3 inches.  Cut each square
diagonally into two triangles. With a metal spatula, lift the
triangles onto an ungreased baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining
balls of dough.

Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned. Let the crisps
rest on the baking sheet for 30 seconds before removing them to wire
racks to cool completely.

The crisps taste best when fresh, but can be stored in an air- tight
container.

Makes about 5 1/2 dozen wafers.

1/4 cup wheat germ
1  currant-pecan filling
1  for sticky buns
1 1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 1/2 tablespoon ground cinnamon
1/2 cup dried currants
3/4 cup finely chopped pecans
1  combine all in a bowl
1  and mix thoroughly.
1  reserve.
1  sticky pecan glaze
1  for sticky buns
1 cup butter, softened
1 3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup dark corn syrup
3/4 cup small pecan halves or
1  coarsely chopped pecans
1  or
1  filling for
1  cinnamon rolls
1 1/2 cup brown sugar
1 1/2 tablespoon cinnamon
1  mix thoroughly.
1  glaze for the
1  cinnamon rolls
1 1/2 cup powdered sugar
1/8 teaspoon vanilla
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1-2 tablespoon warm water

SWEET YEAST DOUGH Note: All-purpose flour can be substituted for wheat
flour and germ, in roughly the same quantity--then you can skip the
step of combining them in a separate bowl.

Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in a small bowl, stir, and let
stand until soft, about 5 minutes. Reserve.

In a large bowl, combine eggs, sugar, salt, baking soda, buttermilk,
and butter, and beat till smooth. Stir in reserved yeast. In a
separate bowl, combine the flours and wheat germ. Then add 3 cups of
the dry mixture to the wet ingredients, beating until well blended.
Add 2 more cups of the dry ingredients and beat until the dough just
holds together. Turn out onto a lightly floured board and knead for 1
minute. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Knead the dough again,
sprinkling on the remainder of the flour mixture as needed, until
smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turn,
cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place until about
doubled in bulk, about 60 minutes.

Meanwhile make the FILLING 	Combine all ingredients, reserve

And the GLAZE STICKY PECAN GLAZE Combine the butter, brown sugar and
corn syrup in a bowl and beat till well mixed. Spread evenly over the
bottom of a buttered 10 x 15-inch baking pan. Sprinkle evenly with
the pecans and set aside.

MAKING STICKY PECAN BUNS Punch the risen dough down and turn it out
onto a lightly floured surface. Roll out into a 15x24-inch rectangle
about 1/2-inch thick. Sprinkle the reserved filling over the dough,
gently pressing the mixture into the dough with your fingers.
Beginning with the short end, roll the dough up like a jelly roll.
Slice crosswise into 12 equal pieces. Place the slices, cut side down
and barely touching each other, on top of the glaze in the pan.
Cover, and let rise in a warm place until puffy and almost doubled in
bulk, about 25 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bake the
buns until golden brown on top, 25-30 minutes. Remove from the oven
and cool in the pan to set the glaze, about 5 minutes. Invert onto a
serving tray or another baking sheet and allow the glaze to dribble
down the sides. Pull apart and serve warm.

IF YOU WANT CINNAMON ROLLS If you want cinnamon rolls, roll the dough
into the same 15x25-inch rectangle, brush with melted butter and
sprinkle the following filling over it, pressing in lightly with

Sweet-Potato Tartlets

deserts

1  *for the filling*
2 small sweet potatoes
1 large egg -- lightly beaten
1/4 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoon unsulfured molasses
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/4 cup light brown sugar -- packed
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 pinch ground cloves
1 pinch allspice
1  *for the praline topping and
1  crust*
1 1/4 cup pecans
1 cup granulated sugar
10 tablespoon unsalted butter -- cut into
1 small piece
3/4 cup light brown sugar
1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

To make the filling: Heat oven to 400 degrees. Prick sweet potatoes.
Place on a baking sheet and bake for 40 minutes or until soft. When
cool enough to handle, peel and mash. Transfer mashed potatoes to an
electric mixer; beat on low speed for 1 minute. Whisk together egg,
cream, molasses and vanilla. Add to potatoes; mix on low speed, 1 to
2 minutes. Mix in remaining filling ingredients. Let stand until
crusts are ready. To make the topping and crust: Begin by making
pecan praline. Place 1/2 cup pecans on a large parchemnt-lined baking
sheet. In a small saucepan, combine granulated sugar and 2
tablespoons water. Cook over low heat until sugar dissolves. Cover
and bring to a boil. Leave cover on until condensation washes down
inside of pan. Uncover, adjust heat to medium, and cook, swirling pan
occassionally, until sugar turns amber. Pour caramel over pecans; let
cool about 1 hour. Chop praline into small pieces. Heat oven to 350
degrees. On a rimmed baking sheet, toast remaining 3/4 cup pecans for
about 7 minutes, turning once. Let cool completely. Transfer to a
food processor and processto a fine powder; add butter, brown sugar,
flour, salt and cinnamon. Pulse until well combined. Set aside 1/2
cup of the mixture to use for topping. Divide the rest among 3-inch
tart tins. press into tins. Refrigerate on a baking sheet for 30
minutes. Poke crusts with a fork, and bake for 5 minutes. Place tart
tins on a work surface and spoon sweet-potato filling into each.
Crumble reserved topping into small pieces and mix in half the
chopped pecan praline. Sprinkle this topping over the sweet-potato
filling, avoiding edges of the crust. Place tarts on a baking sheet,
transfer to oven, and bake for 25 to 35 minutes, until tarts are
puffed and golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool 15 to 20
minutes. Unmold and let cool to room teperature. Sprinkle the
remaining pecan praline over tarts and serve.

Taiglach

breads, deserts, kosher

2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup walnuts, chopped
4 1/2 cup flour
1 lb honey
8  eggs
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon ginger

Mix eggs, flour and baking powder and knead well. Dough should be
soft but stiff enough to roll.  Roll with hands by bits into long
ropes 1/2" in diameter. Use very little flour in rolling to avoid
toughness. Slice in 1/2" lengths.  Heat oven to 350 F.  While oven is
heating, bring to boil the honey, ginger and sugar in a shallow broad
bottmed pan. Put into this the pieces of dough.  Then place pan into
oven.  Do not open oven for first 15 or 20 min.  By this time the
honey will have coated each piece of dough. Now, stir every 10 min.
to prevent the pieces from sticking to each other. Takes abt. an hour
for baking.  Pieces should be brown and when tested in cold water
should remain firm and crisp. Pour onto moistened board, flatten,
sprinkle nuts on top and cut into squares. Makes 40 pcs. and will
keep.

TAILLAULE FROM NEUCHATEL: the story

"Taillaule", a sort of sweetened bread, was made differently in the
past. It was a flattened ball of dough baked directly on the floor of
the oven. The surface was cut sharply with a pointed knife or snipped
with scissors to form deep parallel cuts. This gave rise to its name
"taillaule" meaning cut. These early "taillaules" had a somewhat
different flavour from the present day moulded loaves.

The recipe:

Add the yeast, eggs (1), sugar, malt, salt, lemon zest and flour to
the milk. Knead well to obtain a smooth dough. Add the softened
butter and knead again. Finally add the dried fruit.

Cover the dough and leave to rise in a warm place for about 1 hour.

Divide the dough into 2 equal parts as if making two French sticks and
place in 2 fruit cake tins.

Leave again in a warm place to rise to 3/4 height of tin.

Brush with beaten egg (2) and make zig zag cuts with the scissors in
the surface.

Bake in the tins at 200 oC for 25 minutes .

Remove from oven, brush with an apricot glaze and then coat with a
water icing.

Toasted flaked almonds can be sprinkled on top.

Recommended drink: tea or coffee.

Tarte Au Citron

deserts

2  pate sucree' recipes (see re ipe)
1  raw rice for weighting shell
5 large eggs
3/4 cup sugar
3 tablespoon lemon zest
3 cup lemon juice

Roll out half the dough 1/8-inch thick on a floured surface. Press it
firmly into an 8-inch tart pan with a removable fluted rim. Trim off
excess dough, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang. Fold the overhang back
inside the rim, pressing it to the side of the shell, and push the
dough up 1/4-inch above the edge of the pan. Crimp the edge
decoratively with a fork. Roll out remaining dough and make up
another tart shell in the same manner.

Chill the shells for 60 minutes.  Line the shells with foil, fill the
foil with rice and bake in the lower third of a preheated 400f oven
for 8 minutes.  Remove the rice and foil, and bake for 8-10 minutes
more or until they are pale golden.  Remove shells from the pans,
transfer them to a rack and let them cool.

In a bowl with an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks with 1/2 cup
sugar until the mixture is thick and pale and forms a ribbon. Beat in
the zest and lemon juice. Transfer the mixture to a heavy saucepan.
Cook it, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, over mod-low heat,
until it registers 140f on a candy thermometer. Continue to cook at a
stable 140f for 3 minutes longer. Do not let it boil. Transfer the
mixture to a bowl, and let it cool, covered with a buttered round of
wax paper, until it is luke-warm.

In a bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until they hold
soft peaks.  Add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, one Tbsp at a time, and
beat the meringue until it just hold stiff peaks. Stir a quarter of
the meringue into the lemon mixture and fold in the remaining
meringue gently but thoroughly.

Transfer the tart shells to a baking sheet and fill with the lemon
mixture, mounding it slightly.  Bake the tarts in the middle of a
preheated 400f oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the tops are golden
and puffed. Transfer the tarts to a rack and let them cool.

knife or pastry cutter. Whisk together the egg yolk, lemon juice, and
1 tablespoon of water. Sprinkle the liquid over the butter-flour
mixture and continue to stir or rub this mixture between your fingers
until a ball of dough forms. Be careful not to overwork the dough. If
the mixture is crumbly, add up to one more tablespoon water,
sprinkling it over the dough and lightly kneading it into a ball.

On a floured board and with a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough
into a large circle.  Gently lift it into a 9- or 10-inch pie plate
or tart tin. Patch any holes in the crust with bits of dough and trim
the edges. Flute the crust.  Chill for 2 hours.

Preheat the oven to 375 F.

Place a sheet of aluminum foil in the bottom of the crust and fill it
with dried beans or rice to weigh it down during baking. Bake for 15
minutes. Remove the crust from the oven and carefully lift out the
foil and beans. Bake for 5 minutes more.  Cool.

TO MAKE THE FILLING, heat in a small saucepan 2 cups of the
blueberries, 2 tablespoons of water, and the sugar. Crush a few
berries with a spoon to release the juice. When the berries have
softened and become juicy, add the cornstarch mixture.  Simmer on low
heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture
thickens. Remove it from the heat and fold in one more cup of
blueberries. Pour the berry mixture into the baked pie shell.  Top
with remaining 2 cups blueberries. Cool for at least one hour.

Serve plain or topped with fresh whipped cream, if desired, or
sweetened Creme Fraiche.

Tarte Tatin

deserts

      ----PASTRY----
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1  stick ( 8 tbsp ) cold, unsalted but; ter, cut into 1 pieces
3 tablespoon ice water
      ----FILLING----
2 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/2 cup sugar
2 lb granny smith apples, peeled, cored,; and cut into 1/8ths

Pastry Dough

1. Make the pastry dough: in a food processor, pulse the flour and
sugar together to combine. Add the butter and pulse until coarse
crumbs form. Add the water, 1 tbsp at a time, pulsing just until the
dough comes together. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface
and gather it into a ball. Pat into a disk, wrap tightly in plastic
wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 20 minutes.

2. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a 10",
circle, about 1/4" thick. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured
baking sheet, cover and refrigerate.

3. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Melt the butter in a 9" cast-iron
skillet. Add the sugar and cook over moderately high heat, stirring,
until a rich brown caramel forms, about 5 minutes. Remove from the
heat. Pack the apple pieces in the skillet, rounded sides down but
slightly leaning, in concentric circles.

4. Lay the pastry round on top of the apples, pressing gently to fit
it in the pan. Bake the tart for about 35 minutes, or until the
pastry is golden brown. Let cool slightly, then carefully invert the
pan on a warm serving plate. Serve the tart warm or at least room
temperature accompanied by the Cinnamon Ice Cream.

1 each egg white, room temperature
2 teaspoon granulated sugar
1 each serving non-stick spray(pam)
1 teaspoon powdered sugar, divided
1/8 teaspoon white vinegar
1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup fresh strawberries or kiwi
1 tablespoon whipped topping

Use a shallow rectangular baking dish, approximately 6 by 8 inches.
Spray with non-stick butter flavored cooking spray. Line with wax
paper cut to fit.  Spray again with Pam, dust lightly with 1/2 of the
powdered sugar. Set aside.  Whip egg white until firm peaks form. Add
sugar, vinegar and vanilla and whip until stiff peaks form, about 30
seconds to 1 minute more. Spread evenly in baking dish, and cook in
microwave oven for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on high. The meringue will
stretch and spread while baking, but will shrink back to proper size
while cooling, so don't panic! Cool meringue, and turn out onto wax
paper that has been lightly dusted with the remaining powdered sugar.
Spread with the tablespoon of whipped topping, top with the fruit and
gently roll up. Garnish with small piece of fruit and mint leaves.
Another dollop of whipped topping may be used on top with the fruit
garnish, but if you do so, add another 10 to 14 calories to the
total. Calorie Count: 100 calories. Fat: 1 gram. Total Preparation
Time: 5 minutes! This is a pavlova even a non-dieter can enjoy, and

Tiered Biscotti Tree

deserts

1 1/2 cup slivered almonds
3/4 cup butter/margarine, at room
1  temperature
1 cup sugar
1 tablespoon grated orange peel
4 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
4 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
4 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
      ----MARMALADE ICING----
3/4 cup orange marmalade
1 lb sugar, powdered
1 tablespoon grand marnier or orange
1  juice

Constructed from baked biscotti dough, the cookie tree is an edible
centerpiece. Place almonds in a 8 to 9 inch pan. Bake in a 350~ oven,
shaking often, until golden, about 15 minutes; cool. In a large bowl,
beat butter, sugar and orange peel until fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a
time, beating well after each addition.  Stir in vanilla. Combine
4-1/2 cups flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, cloves, coriander,
nutmeg and nuts; add to butter mixture and stir to blend thoroughly.
Divide dough into 3 equal pieces.  On a well-floured board, pat each
piece into an evenly thick triangle that measures 9 inches across
base, 2 inches across top and 12 inches on each side.  Make edges
neat by pressing with a ruler. Carefully transfer each triangle with
wide spatulas to an oiled 12x15 inch baking sheet.  Bake in a 350~
oven for 15 minutes; triangles can wait for oven space. Remove from
oven; cut crosswise (NOT diagonally) into slices exactly 5/8 inch
wide, using a long knife. Tip slices onto a cut side. Bake until
golden brown, about 20 minutes; turn cookies over once while baking.
Cool on reacks.  If made ahead, package airtight up until next day or
freeze. To build the tree, pipe (using a 1/4 inch tip) or spread a
little frosting on 1 side of each of the longest cookies. Lay
icing-side down on a flat platter, tips touching, to form a triangle.
Pip or spread icing down center of each cookie on plate. Stack the 3
next-longest cookies on the first, inverting position of the triangle
(looking down from the top, it will look like a Star of David). Build
tree, using the next-smallest cookie trio for each level and
cementing with icing. If you like, pipe icing to drip over the edge
of the cookies.  Decorate top with holly. Let guests lift off cookies
to eat. If made ahead or to protect from dust, seal in plastic wrap;
cookies stay fresh up to 4 days, depending on moisture in air.  Kept
longer, they hold their shape but get stale. Icing: Smoothly mix
together 3/4 cp orange marmalade, 1 box (1 lb) or 4 cups sifted
powder and 1 Tablespoon orange-flavor liqueur or orange juice. If
icing thickens as you work, stir in a little more orange juice.

Tipsy Lady

british, deserts

      ----CUSTARD SAUCE----
4  egg yolks
1/2 cup sugar
1 cup milk; scalded
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup heavy cream; whipped
      ----TIPSY LADY----
1  sponge cake; 8 or 9 diameter
1  or pound cake
1/3 cup cream sherry
1/3 cup brandy
2/3 cup raspberry or strawberry jam
1 cup heavy cream; whipped
1/3 cup slivered almonds; toasted

Whip the egg yolks and sugar in the top of a cold double boiler. Pour
in the scalded milk, whisking all the while. Set the pot over boiling
water and continue stirring until the custard starts to thicken and
will coat a spoon smoothly.  It will fluff up and resemble
hollandaise sauce. Stir in the vanilla and pour the custard into a
mixing bowl. Chill in the refrigerator.  When cold, whisk lightly to
soften, fold in the whipped cream, and set aside.

Split the cake into 3 layers and sprinkle them with sherry and brandy.
Spread 2 layers with jam.  Place one of these layers in a clear glass
serving bowl barely large enough to hold the whole dessert, and
sprinkle it with more sherry and brandy, followed by half of the
Bavarian cream. Stack the second jam-covered layer on top and repeat
the procedure, using up the remaining sherry, brandy, and Bavarian
cream. Place the third layer on top and cover with whipped cream.
Sprinkle with the toasted almonds. Refrigerate for at least 1 to 2
hours before serving so that the flavors blend and the cake moistens
properly.

Tiramisu 3

deserts

3  egg yolks
3 tablespoon superfine sugar
1 1/3 cup marsala or brandy
1/4 cup very strong espresso coffee
8 oz mascarpone cheese, room temperature
1/2 cup cream
1  egg white
4 oz ladyfingers

Tiramisu("pick me up") is a modern version of a dessert first created
in Siena, where it was called zuppa del Duca (the Duke's soup!). From
there it migrated to Florence, where it became very popular in the
nine- teenth century among the many English people who came to live
in the city at that time. And so it was called zuppa inglese--English
soup. Only recently, the same dessert with some variation--chiefly
the substitution of rich mascarpone cheese for the original
custard--has come to be called tiramisu.

Make a zablione by beating the egg yolks and sugar in the top of a
double boiler until ivory colored.  Add 1/3 cup liquor and whisk over
gently simmering water until the mixture begins to thicken. Let cool.

Stir the coffee into the mascarpone. Whip the cream to soft peaks.
Beat the egg white until stiff.  Fold the egg white into the
zabaglione. Dip the lady fingers into the remaining liquor and
arrange in a single layer in the bottom of a 9 in. bowl. Cover them
with half the mascarpone, then half the zabaglione and half the
cream. Repeat the layers, finishing with the cream. Refrigerate for
several hours before serving. From: Fred Towner Date: 08-03-93

1  rita taule
6  egg yolks
6 tablespoon sugar
6 tablespoon dry marsala
1 lb mascarpone room temp.
2/3 cup chilled whipping cream
1/3 cup freshly brewed espresso coff
1/4 cup dark rum

Hi Scott, hi Stacy!  Know you love desserts, so I thought I'd share
this fabulous recipe from Bon Appetit with you. Granted, it is a bit
time-consuming, but should keep you busy - and...it is so worth the
wait. Whisk yolks, 6 tablespoons sugar, and Marsala in large metal
bowl to blend. Set bowl over saucepan of simmering water (do not
allow water to touch bottom of bowl). Using portable electric mixer
beat until mixture triples in volume about 5 minutes. Cover
zabaglione and refrigerate until well chilled.  (Can be prepared 2
days ahead). Place mascarpone in large bowl. Using electric mixer
whip cream with 2 tablespoons sugar in medium bowl to soft peaks.
Fold into mascarpone. Gently fold in zabaglione. Refrigerate until
well chilled about 3 hours. Combine espresso coffee, rum, 3
tablespoons sugar, and vanilla in small bowl. Brush over both sides
of cake pieces. Place generous tablespoon mascarpone mixture in
bottom of each of 8 balloon-shaped wineglasses. Set cake square or
wedge into each at angle. Top with remaining mascarpone mixture.
Combine shaved chocolate and ground coffee
03/13/92        2:41 PM beans.  Sprinkle over

desserts.  Refrigerate until chilled at least 30 minutes and up to 3
hours. NOTE:  Instead of 12x6x1 layer sponge cake cut into eight 3
squares you may use a 9 round sponge cake cut into 8 wedges. Take all
the time you need to enjoy this scrumptious recipe! Rita in ever so
sunny and beautiful Scottsdale....02/22/92

Tiramisu Dessert Pizza

deserts

12 oz mascarpone cheese
1/3 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup brewed espresso, cooled
1  unsweetened cocoa powder
1  confectioner's sugar
1  fresh raspberries (garnish)

In a food processor or mixing bowl, whip the mascarpone cheese and
confectioners' sugar until smooth and creamy.

Beat in the espresso. The mixture should be creamy and easy to spread
at this point; if not, add a bit more espresso.

Spread a thick layer of tiramisu filling over a baked pizza shell.
Dust the cheese liberally with cocoa powder, followed by a very light
dusting of confectioners' sugar to achieve a dappled effect.

Fresh fruit such as raspberries can be arranged around the edge of the
pizza as a garnish.

Tiramisu Parfaits

deserts, italian

1  egg whites; large
1 pinch cream of tartar
2/3 cup sugar
1/2 lb mascarpone cheese
2 tablespoon dark rum
2 oz bittersweet chocolate; fine quality/chopped fine
1 cup butter cookies; crumbs or pound cake crum
1 cup coffee; brewed/lukewarm
      ----GARNISH----
2 oz bittersweet chocolate; chop fine

Put the eggwhites in a bowl of an electric mixer and put the bowl in a
second bowl of hot water and let the whites stand, stirring
occasionally, for 15 minutes.

Add the cream of tartar and salt and bet the whites until they just
hold stiff peaks. While the whites are being beaten, in a saucepan
combine the sugar and 1/4 cup of water. Bring the mixture to a boil,
stirring to dissolve the sugar, and boil the syrup until it registers
240 deg. on a candy thermometer.  Add the sugar syrup to the whites
in a stream, slowly,while beating and beat the mixture until it is
cool. Add the mascarpone, rum and chocolate and beat until well
combined. Divide the cookie or cake crumbs among 4 stemmed glasses.
Drizzle each portion with 2 tablespoons of the coffee and top the
crumbs with half the mascarpone mixture.  Layer the remaining cookie
crumbs, coffee and mascarpone mixture in the same manner. Chill the
parfaits, covered for a minimum of
2    hours, or overnight.

Garnish:  In a metal bowl, set over a pan of barely simmering water,
melt the chocolate.  Line a baking sheet with foil and spread the
chocolate about 1/8" thick on the foil. Chill the chocolate triangles
on the baking sheet until it is just set, but not hard, and with a
pastry wheel, cut it into triangles.  Chill the chocolate triangles
on the baking sheet until they have hardened and peel the foil
carefully from them. Garnish each parfait with a chocolate triangle.

Toffee Apples & Bananas

bananas, deserts, fruits/nuts, oriental

2 large firm apples
2  firm bananas
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cornstarch
1 large egg
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 1/3 cup oil, preferably peanut
2 teaspoon sesame oil
3/4 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoon white sesame seeds, toasted

PEEL AND CORE THE APPLES and cut each into 8 large wedges. Peel the
bananas and cut them into 1 1/2-inch chunks. Combine the flour,
cornstarch, egg and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil in a small bowl. Mix
them well to form a smooth, very thick batter. Combine the peanut oil
and 2 teaspoons of sesame oil in a deep fat fryer or wok and heat the
mixture until it is moderately hot. Put the fruit into the batter
mixture. Then lift out several pieces of fruit at a time, using a
slotted spoon, and drain off any excess batter. Deep-fry for about 2
minutes, until they are golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain
on paper towels. Repeat the process until you have deep-fried all the
fruit. Just before serving, prepare a bowl of ice water filled with
ice cubes. Reheat the oil over moderate heat and deep-fry the fruit a
second time for about 2 minutes. Drain again on paper towels. Put the
sugar, sesame seeds and 2 tablespoons of oil from the deep-frying oil
into a pot. Heat the mixture until the sugar melts and begins to
caramelize. (Watch the heat to prevent it from burning.) When the
caramel is light brown, add the fruit sections. Stir them gently in
the caramel syrup to coat them. Then take them out and put them into
the ice water to harden. Do a few at a time to prevent them from
sticking together. Remove them from the water and place on a serving
platter. Serve at once.

It's light, fast, and a perfect complement to pies, puddings, and
fruit compotes.  Tofu Whip can be stored in the refrigerator for up
to 1 week; if the mixture separates, blend it thoroughly before
using. The recipe may be cut in half.

In a food processor or blender, blend all of the ingredients until
very creamy, adding water if needed to achieve a whipped cream
consistency. Refrigerate until needed.

VARIATION: Instead of maple syrup, try 3 to 4 tablespoons of
fruit-sweetened preserves and some finely minced citrus peel. Choose
the fruit and citrus flavors to complement the dessert.

Tomato & Basil Tarts

deserts

1  recipe puff pastry
1  recipe thick tomato coulis
6 medium vine ripened tomatoes
3 tablespoon shredded basil
1  oil
1  salt and pepper

Contributed to the echo by: Janice Norman TOMATO AND BASIL TARTS
Quickly roll out the pastry and cut out six 4-5" rounds. Place rounds
on a thick baking sheet and sprinkle with a little cold water. Place
baking sheet in freezer until ready to assemble and bake tarts. Slice
the tomatoes and lay them on paper towels for thirty minutes to drain
off excess moisture. This will prevent the tarts from being soggy.
One half hour before serving, preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Take
the baking sheet from the freezer and spread a layer of Thick Tomato
Coulis over the pastry rounds leaving 1/2 inch rim around the edge.
Arrange the drained tomato slices over the coulis and scatter with
shredded basil. Sprinkle with salt and some freshly grated black
pepper then drizzle with oil. Immediately place in the oven and bake
for 20 minutes or until the pastry is puffed and golden. Serve at
once.

Traditional Caramel Custard - Flan A La Antig

deserts, mexican

1  jim vorheis
3/4 cup sugar
1  the custard:
1 quart milk
1 pinch of sea salt
1/2 cup sugar
2  inch cinnamon stick or vanilla bean
1  small piece of orange or lemon rind; (optional)
4  eggs
6  egg yolks

The caramel: Heat the sugar for the caramel in a small, heavy frying
pan over low heat until it begins to dissolve. Shake the pan slightly
(do not stir) until all the sugar has melted. Increase the flame and
let the sugar bubble and color.  Pour the caramel into the mold and
quickly turn it around in all directions, tipping it up in a circular
motion until the surface - bottom and 2 inches up the sides - has
been lightly coated with the caramel.  If the caramel thickens and
becomes sluggish, gently heat the mold in a pan of hot water or over
low heat, depending on the material, and continue the coating action.
Set aside to cool.

Put the milk, salt, sugar, and cinnamon or vanilla into a saucepan and
bring slowly to a boil, stirring until the sugar has dissolved.
Continue boiling slowly, taking care that it does not boil over,
until the milk has reduced by about 2/3 cup.  Set aside to cool.

Place an oven rack on the lowest rung of the oven and heat to 325 F.

Beat the eggs and yolks together and stir into the tepid milk. Pour
the mixture through a strainer into the flan mold and place it in a
hot water bath in the oven. Test after 2 hours with a skewer or cake
tester; if it comes out quite clean, the flan is cooked. Remove from
the oven, but allow to sit in the water bath for about 15 minutes
longer. Remove and set aside to cool completely before refrigerating.

Tres Leches

deserts, mexican

      ----CAKE----
1 cup sugar
5 large eggs
1/2 cup milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup flour
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
      ----MILK SYRUP----
1 can evaporated milk 12 oz
1 cup sweetened condensed milk
1 cup heavy cream or whipping crem
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon light rum
      ----MERINGUE----
1 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon cream of tarter
3  egg whites

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Generously butter a 13X9 in baking dish.
Prepare the cake:  beat 3/4 of the sugar and the egg yolks until
light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Fold in the milk, vanilla, flour
and baking powder. Beat the egg whites to soft peaks, adding the
cream of tarter after 20 seconds. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup
sugar and continue beating until the whites are glossy and firm but
not dry. Gently fold the whites into the yolk mixture. Pour this
mixture into the buttered baking dish. Bake the cake until the cake
feels firm and an inserted toothpick comes out clean, 40 to 50
minutes.  Let the cake cool completely on a wire over with a fork.
Prepare the milk syrup: combine the evaporated milk, sweetened
condensed milk, cream, vanilla and rum in a mixing bowl. Whisk until
well mixed.  Pour the syrup over the cake, spooning the overflow back
on top until all is absorbed.

Prepare the meringue:  Place 3/4 cup plus 2 Tbls of the sugar in a
heavy saucepan with 1/4 cup of water. Cover and cook over high heat
for 2 minutes.  Uncover the pan and cook the sugar to the soft ball
stage, 239F on the candy thermometer, 6 - 8 minutes. Meanwhile, beat
the egg whites to soft peaks with the cream of tarter. Add the
remaining 2 Tbls sugar and continue beating to stiff peaks.  Pour the
boiling sugar syrup i a thin stream into the whites and continue
beating until the mixture is cool to touch. The hot syrup "cooks" the
whites. Using a wet spatula, spread the top and sides of the cake
with a thick layer of the meringue. Refrigerate the cake for at least
2 hours before serving.

Trifle

deserts

1  sponge cake; leftover
1 cup raspberry jam
1/4 cup almonds, slivered
1/4 cup brandy:*
3/4 cup sherry
1 1/2 cup milk
1 cup heavy cream; or whipping
1  vanilla pod
1 teaspoon cornstarch
3 tablespoon sugar
5  eggs
2 cup heavy cream; or whipping whipped
8  citron slices; *
6  strawberries; -or-
6  crystallized violets

* Anne's note; I would use 1 cup sherry and not bother with the
brandy * Citron is larger than a lemon. The fruit is not eaten but
the rind id used as a decoration. Can be found in speciality stores,
omit if you can't find it "Trifle, a favorite Victorian recipe, is
the perfect party recipe. Make it well ahead of time of time, so that
the sherry and brandy have enough time to seep into the cake. The
charm of Trifle is its different textures. Since these also look
interesting , Trifle should be served in a glass bowl so that the
effect can be seen to full advantage. As an alternative serve it in
individual glass dishes."
Cut the cake into very thick slices and spread each piece with a
generous amount of raspberry jam. Arrange the slices on the bottom of
a large glass bowl. If you prefer to use individual dishes, divide
the cake equally among the dishes. Sprinkle the almonds over the cake
slices, pour on the brandy and sherry and allow it it to soak for
about 40 minutes (but not longer as the cake will becomes soggy.
*Anne's note, I like it soggy, and left the cake to soak overnight.)
Bring the milk and cream with vanilla pod to a boil in a double
boiler. Remove from heat and discard the vanilla pod.
Mix the cornstarch with the sugar and eggs and gradually pour in
the milk and cream. Transfer the mixture back to the double boiler
and stir until the custard becomes thick and creamy; do not allow to
boil.
Let the custard cool a little and then pour it over the cake. Let
the cake set and when it fully cooled, spread any remaining jam on
top, then cover with whipped cream.
Decorate the trifle with citron slices and crystallized violets or
strawberry slices. Refrigerate until ready to serve. SERVES:6-8

Turkish Baklava

deserts, greek, turkish

1  pkg fillo sheets
1 lb butter, melted
1 lb walnuts, chopped
3 cup sugar, white granulated
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon or
1/4 teaspoon ground and 1 stick cinnamon
1  9 x 13 pyrex baking dish
1  pastry brush

1. Chop walnuts to medium fine and mix with 1 cup sugar, 1/4 Teaspoon
ground Cinnamon and 1/4 Teaspoon ground Cloves. 2. Melt Butter. 3. Cut
Fillo in half so that each sheet fits the bottom of the Baking Pan. 4.
Generously butter the bottom and sides of the baking pan and place the
Fillo, one sheet ata a time, in the baking pan. Generously spread
butter on each sheet of fillo as it is placed in the pan. Every 6 to
8 sheets of Fillo sp[read a layer of walnut mix.  Continue layering
Fillo sheets and walnuts until Fillo is complete. Pour any remaining
butter over top of the Baklava.  The secret to good flaky Baklava is
to have each sheet of Fillo well buttered so that the sheets do not
stick together. 5. With a sharp knife, cut the Baklava diagonally to
form diamond shaped pieces. 6. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and bake
the Baklava for 40 to 45 minutes or until golden brown on top.
Remove from oven and allow to cool completely. 7. SYRUP Mix one cup
water, two cups sugar, 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves and either 3/4
teaspoons Cinnamon or the Cinnamon stick in a sauce pan and bring to
a bnoil. Simmer for 20 minutes. 8. Pour the boiling syrup over the
cool Baklava and allow to cool completely again. When cool serve
individual pieces with strong (Turkish) sweet coffee and dried
apricots for an exquisite dessert.

Two Hour Nut Rolls - Quick Potica

deserts

2 pkg yeast, cake or dry
1/3 cup milk, lukewarm
6 cup flour
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon sugar
1/2 cup butter or margerine, melted
1  eggs, beaten slightly
1 cup evaporated milk, warm

Source: Treasured Slovenian & International Recipes

*DIRECTIONS* Dissolve yeast in warm milk. Crumble in well so this
mixture is smooth. Combine flour, sugar, salt. Add warm evaporated
milk, melted butter and eggs. Now add the yeast mixture and mix well
together. Then knead this dough until smooth and handles well. Divide
dough into two parts. Roll out each part as thin as possible and
spread with honey nut filling.

We suggest that you prepare the filling before you make the dough, so
as to have it ready to spread on immediately, as you do not need to
have the dough rise before spreading on filling.

*=FILLING=-= INGREDIENTS* 1 lb. nut meats, ground 1/2 cup butter or
margerine, melted 1/2 cup evaporated milk, scalded 1/2 cup honey 1
egg, well beaten 1 cup sugar 2 cups yellow raisins (Sultanas) 1 tsp.
cinnamon

*DIRECTIONS* Pour scalded milk over nuts. Add sugar, honey and melted
butter. Mix well. When cool add beaten egg and cinnamon. Now spread
this mixture over rolled dough, sprinkle on the raisins. Roll up as
for jelly roll and set this aside in warm place to rise until double
in size. Bake in 350 F oven for 35 - 40 minutes. Before baking brush
over top with one egg beaten in with 1/2 cup milk, for golden crust.

*VARIATIONS*

Grandma uses pecans or English walnuts, and doesn't use raisins. When
she roll out the dough she then places it on a smooth towel so that
it will be easier to roll up the dough. Cover the potica while rising
with same towel.

Ukrainian Almond Crescents

breads, deserts

2 cup to 2 1/2 c unbleached white flour
1 pkg dry yeast (about 1 tbs)
1 cup sweet butter, room temp
2  egg yolks, beaten
3/4 cup sour cream
1  filling:
2 cup almonds, toasted and coarsley groun; d
2/3 cup to 3/4 c brown sugar, firmly packed
2  egg whites
1 pinch of salt

From "Sundays at Moosewood Restaurant." Yields 24 pastries

Rogaliki, which means  "little horns," are a specialty of the southern
Ukraine.  They are flaky pastries stuffed with sugar and nuts, and I
warn you, they can be addictive. Although I am seldom interested in
sweets, these are "devilish horns," tempting even me to eat just one
more!

Pastry:

For the pastry, mix together the flour and yeast in a med bowl. Cut
in the butter with a pastry fork until the mixture resembles coarse
meal. Stir in the egg yolks and sour cream and mix well. The mixture
will still be crumbly.  Form the dough into a ball using your hands,
working it as little as possible.  The less you knead, the more
tender the pastry will be. The dough will be tacky.  Wrap it in waxed
paper and chill it for at least 2 hours.

Prepare the filling by combining the ground almonds and sugar in a
small bowl.  Beat together the egg whites and salt until stiff, but
not dry, and carefully fold them into the nut mixture.

Preheat the oven to 375F.  When the dough is thoroughly chilled,
divide it into three balls.  Using a floured rolling pin, roll out
three circles about 1/8" thick. Work on a well-floured surface to
prevent the dough from sticking.  Cut each circle into eight
pie-shaped wedges and spread the wedges with the filling. Starting at
the wide end, roll each wedge up like a little croissant and then
pull the ends into a curve to form a "horn." Make sure the point is
on the bottom so the "horns" will not open up while baking.

Place the almond crescents on a lightly oiled baking sheet and bake
for about 30 - 40 min, until golden and puffed.

Undescended Twinkies

beverages, deserts

6 oz orange jell-o; (2 pkgs)
1 cup ; boiling water
1/2 cup pineapple juice
1 quart vanilla ice cream; softened
7 oz 7-up
8  twinkies

Dissolve Jell-O in boiling water.  Add pineapple juice, ice cream and
7-Up. Mix thoroughly (In a blender if necessary to dissolve ice
cream), and pour into a deep pan, approximately 9-inches square.
Chill until mixture begins to set.  Lay Twinkies, flat side down, in
two rows of four across the top of the chilled gelatin. If the
gelatin is properly chilled, it will resist the Twinkies.  You will
push them in and they will slowly rise. Remember you don't want them
buried. Just semi-decended in the ooze. Chill until fully set and
serve.

Upside Down Pear Tart

deserts

7  firm ripe pears (about 3-1/2 pounds; )
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup (1 stick) butter or margarine
1/2 pkg pie crust mix or your favorite sing; le-crust recipe
1/2 cup heavy cream, whipped

FROM:      Family Circle, 9/72

A deliciously different way to make a pear tart. Caramelized fresh
pears bake under a flaky curst. When turned out, the handsome fruit
design shows.

Pare, halve and core pears.  Slice 7 or 8 halves crosswise and on an
angle, each into 4 or 5 slices, keeping slices intact. Arrange as
whole halves in a 9-inch deep pie plate, rounded side down ans stem
ends towards center; trim one pear half to a round to fit center.
Slice remaining pears into 1/2-inch slices, arrange on top to fill
plate.

Melt 1/2 cup of teh sugar over medium-high heat in a small heavy
skillet; continue heating until sugar caramelized and turns
golden-brown. Remove from heat; quickly stir in butter until almost
melted, then pour over pears.

Prepare piecrust mix, following label directions or make pastry from
your favorite single-crust recipe. Roll out to a 10-inch round on a
lightly floured pastry board; place on top of pears. Do not attach to
edge.

BAke in 425~ oven for 30 minutes or until crust is golden and pears
are done. (Place a piece of foil under pie in case juices should
bubble out.) Cool on wire rack about 30 minutes. Invert onto a
serving platter with a rim. (Pie will have formed a syrup.) With a
baster or spoon, remove syrup to a 1-cup measure. (You should then
have about 1/4 cup, depending on the fruit.)

Melt remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a small heavy saucepan. Heat very
slowly until sugar melts into a colorless liquid, then turns
golden-brown color and is caramelized. Stir in the reserved fruit
syrup from the tart. Boil the syrup rapidly until it is reduced to
about 1/2 cup. It will be slightly thickened.  Take care it does not
scorch as you are boiling.

Just before serving, spoon warm caramel sauce evenly over tart,
reserving 1 Tbsp.  Spoon or pipe whipped cream onto center; drizzle
reserved caramel sauce over.

Valentine Meringue Hearts

deserts, holiday

3  egg whites
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 dash salt
1 cup sugar
1  red food coloring
1 quart vanilla ice cream
1 pint strawberries; sliced

Cut a heart pattern from a 4-1/2 inch square of paper. Cover
baking sheet with brown paper. (You can bake on the brown paper so
make sure it is clean.) Grocery store bags without writing on them
are okay. Draw 6 hearts on the brown paper using your pattern as a
guide.

1. Beat egg whites with vanilla, cream of tartar and salt until
frothy. Add sugar, a little at a time, and continue beating until
stiff peaks form and sugar is dissolved. Rub a bit between your
figures to feel that no sugar remains undissolved. Add food coloring,
a few drops to make a delicate pink color.
2. Spread meringue over the heart shapes, 1/4 inch thick. Make
into the heart shape using a spoon to push and form into correct
shape. Pipe rim 3/4 inch high with pastry tube.
3. Bake in preheated 275-degree oven for 1 hour. Turn off oven
and let meringues dry in oven for 1 more hour. DO NOT open oven door
during this time.
4. Fill the cooled meringues with scoops of ice cream and top
with strawberries. Decorate with mint leaves if desired.

1  or shiitake - thinly sliced
1  anchovy paste - 2 pencil eraser-siz; ed pieces
1 can whole peeled tomatoes - italian sty; le (roma),
1  drained, juice retained, coarsley c; hopped (28 oz.)
1 oz sun-dried tomatoes - reconstituted; in boiling
1  water for 1 to 2 minutes, drained,; thinly sliced
1 tablespoon basil - fresh, chopped or 1/2 t. dr; ied, crumbled
1/4 cup red wine - quality dry wine only
1/2 cup reserved tomato juice from drained; tomatoes,
1  actually 1/2 to 3/4 cup
1 dash tabasco
1  freshly ground black pepper, coarse; ly ground
1  salt to taste
12 oz pasta - preferably rotini, cooked a; l dente

*DIRECTIONS*

Bring veal chops to room temperature.  Season with freshly ground
coarse black pepper on both sides, pressing pepper into chops. Melt
butter and olive oil in large, deep-sided frying pan. Brown chops on
medium-high heat until well browned, about 5 minutes per side. Remove
and cover with plastic wrap to keep warm.

Add chopped shallots to frying pan and saute, stirring occasionally,
about 3 minutes. Add garlic and continue sauteeing, stirring
constantly, another minute or so. Add sliced mushrooms and saute for
1 to 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium and add
sun-dried tomatoes, chopped tomatoes, anchovy paste, Tabasco, basil,
red wine and 1/2 cup reserved tomato juice. Cook on medium heat
UNCOVERED approximately 15 minutes. If sauce gets too thick, thin
with remaining tomato juice, keeping in mind the fact that the pasta
will thin sauce slightly. Taste and correct seasoning, adding more
basil if desired along with salt and black pepper. Add veal chops to
sauce mixture, along with any meat juices that have accumulated on
plate, sinking chops as best as possible. Cook UNCOVERED about 10
minutes, and then flip chops. Cook another 5 minutes UNCOVERED and
again remove chops to plate and cover with plastic wrap to keep warm.
(Do not overcook the veal!)

Add cooked pasta to sauce and heat on medium-low about 5 minutes,
stirring occasionally, until pasta is warm. Taste and correct
seasoning.

Serve pasta on large platter with veal chops and sprinkle freshly
grated imported Romano on top of pasta.

Serves 4.

Serve with Caesar Salad or Spinach Salad and garlic bread. Something
lemony would be great for dessert, like Lemon Ice or Lemon Cheesecake.

Vegan: Bread Pudding

puddings, vegatarian, vegetarian

2 cup grated apples
1  juice of 1 lemon
4 cup whole grain bread, cubed, small
1/3 cup raisins
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 1/2 cup soymilk
1/2 cup maple syrup
1  some vanilla if you use plain soymi; lk
1  egg replacer to equal one egg

Mix lemon juice with grated apple. Blend the soymilk, egg replacer,
maple syrup and cinnamon (and vanilla, if you use it) together. Put
one third of the bread in the bottom of a greased 8" by 8" baking
dish and cover with 1 cup of the apples and half the raisins.  Pour
one cup of the liquid mixture over these ingredients. Repeat the
layers of bread, apple and raisins, ending with a top layer of bread.
Pour the rest of the liquid ingredients over it.  Sprinkle with
cinnamon. Let pudding sit for a few minutes (original recipes called
for 20 minutes, I let it sit for 5). Bake, covered, at 350 degrees F
(325 if you use a glass dish) for 45 minutes. Let stand for 10 to 20
minutes at room temperature before serving. Was great for breakfast.

Notes: I used a whole wheat cinnamon raisin bread, which combined
with the vanilla soymilk and maple syrup made it fairly sweet, which
I like but others might not. The orginal recipe called for margerine
to be dotted on top before baking. I cut it out because of fat
considerations, but I guess it would make the top crisper. Heavily
adapted from a recipe in the original Laurel's Kitchen.  It creates a
soft, moist, but yummy pudding. This was my first attempt to veganize
a baked recipe, and I think it turned out fairly well. Debbie

Viennese Baked Apples

deserts, ethnic

6 large apples
1/2 cup seedless raspberry jam
1  grated rind of 1/2 an orange
1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts or almonds
3 tablespoon sugar

An old Egyptian dream book states that "to dream of looking at apples
betokens a wedding.  To dream of eating apples is a sign of mourning
unless they are very sweet, then it is a sign of a great deal of
prosperity in the marriage state".  Apples have travelled from the
Old World to the New, but for some reason, we haven't created as many
interesting desserts with them as the Europeans.  We seem to limit
ourselves to pies, crunchy puddings, applesauce and jelly. This is
one new way to try apples.

When possible, use the large Rome Beauty apples

Core apples and peel skin about 1/3 of the way down from the stem end.
Pierce the rest of the skin all over with a fork to lessen wrinkling
and splitting. Place apples in a large, deep pan that has a good
cover and add water to a depth of 1/4 inch.  Mix jam with orange rind
and nuts,fill the centre of each apple, then sprinkle sugar over top.
Bring water in pan to a boil, then cover, lower heat and simmer 20-30
minutes,depending on size of apples.  Baste 2-3 times with pan
juices. To glaze apples, uncover when cooled, sprinkle top with an
additional tbsp of sugar and place under broiler 3 inches from heat
until lightly browned. Watch closely, as they brown very quickly.
Serve warm, tepid or cold. Serves 6.

Vinegar Taffy

candy

1 cup sugar
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup light corn syrup
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon vinegar
1 teaspoon vanilla or other flavoring such as; orange or lemon, or use:
1/2 teaspoon peppermint or:
1 oz bitter chocolate, grated

From Grandma Ruby's recipe file: newspaper clipping

Cook sugar, water, corn syrup, salt and vinegar until a few drops of
the mixture will make a hard ball in cold water, 260 degrees on a
candy thermometer.  Pour onto a greased dish or platter, sprinkle
flavoring over top and turn the outer edges of the candy in toward
the center until cool and firm enough to handle.

Best results are obtained in pulling if the tips of the thumbs and
fingers are dipped in cornstarch or fat. Use only the fingertips to
pull taffy. When mixture can be handled, take up and pull out with
both hands. Fold over and pull out again.

As the mixture becomes cooler and the longer it is pulled, it will
become stiffer and can be pulled out in a longer strand. Pull until
it is difficult to pull out and the mixture seems quite firm.

Pull into long thin strips and cut immediately with greased scissors
and roll each piece in powdered sugar or wrap in wax paper. Store
cooled taffy in an air tight container in a cool dry place.

If the taffy sugars, it can be recooked by putting it in a pan with 2
Tablespoons corn syrup and 1/4 cup water. Stir until dissolved and
then recook according to original directions.

Finely chopped nuts or fruit, as well as other flavorings, are added
as the taffy is being pulled.

I wish I had a date for this...I'd say recipe is at _least_ 30 years
old...possibly 40, maybe even more... This is a lesson to all of you
to date your recipes, including newspaper clippings!

Waffle Cone

deserts

3  eggs
3/4 cup sugar, granulated
1/2 cup butter, melted
2 teaspoon vanilla
1 1/2 cup flour
2 teaspoon baking powder

Beat the eggs and gradually beat in the sugar until the mixture is creamy.
Stir in the melted butter and vanilla.

Combine the flour and baking powder, and then add it to the mixture. Blend
it in well.

Drop about 4 t of the batter into a heated pizelle iron, and cook both
sides over medium-high heat for about 1 minute each, or until golden brown.

Remove the waffle from the pizelle iron and immediately shape it into a
cone while it is still pliable.

NOTES:

*  Waffle ice-cream cone, pizelles -- This recipe comes from a recent issue
of _Canadian Living_ magazine. Waffle cones look like round waffles shaped
into a cone and have a wonderful taste. (I admit it, I'm hooked on them.)
This recipe is actually for a type of cookie called the pizelle, but it
tastes just like the waffle cones you can get at an ice-cream parlor.
Yield:  about 20 cones.

*  A pizelle iron looks like a round waffle iron.  There are "manual" irons
and electric ones too.  If you don't have a pizelle iron, another idea is
to use an ordinary waffle iron and have ice-cream on top of the waffle. Not
having either a waffle iron or a pizelle iron, we tried making these on an
electric griddle, but since the batter is fairly thick it wouldn't spread
into a large enough circle to make cones from.

*  When you form the cones, there will probably be a small hole in the
bottom of them that ice-cream can drip out of. One idea for plugging this
hole is to put miniature marshmallows in the bottoms of the cones.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1-2 minutes (per cone) cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

Warm Pineapple Mousse With Toasted Shredded C

deserts, fruits/nuts

1  fresh pineapple; peeled,  cored, pured, &
1/2 cup heavy cream
6  egg yolks
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup water
6  egg whites
1/4 cup coconut, shredded
2 tablespoon powdered sugar

In a medium saucepan place the pineapple pure and the heavy cream,
and stir them together.  Heat the mixture on medium for 8 to 10
minutes, or until it is reduced to a syrup. Keep it warm.

In a small bowl place the egg yolks and the cornstarch, and beat them
together.  Add the egg yolks to the cream mixture. While whipping
constantly, cook the mixture for 6 to 8 minutes, or until it is the
consistency of a medium whipped cream.  Set it aside.

In a small bowl place the egg whites.  Beat them with an electric
mixer on low speed for 2 to 3 minutes, or until they are frothy. Turn
the electric mixer on high, and while continuing to beat the egg
whites slowly pour the sugar-water mixture down the side of the bowl.
Continue to beat the mixture for 8 to 10 minutes more, or until the
meringue is very shiny and the bottom of the mixing bowl is cool.

Add the cream mixture to the meringue, and gently fold it in.

Preheat the oven to 400F.  In each of 4 small souffl dishes place
the mixture so that the dishes are half-filled. Add the shredded
coconut. Fill the dishes up with the remaining mixture. Sprinkle the
powdered sugar on top.  Bake the mousse for 8 to 10 minutes, or until
it is set. Remove it from the oven.

Place the mousse under a preheated broiler for 30 seconds, or until
the sugar is caramelized.

Wedding Torte

deserts

7  eggs, separated
1 cup granulated sugar
1  zest of 1/2 lemon
1 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/3 cup butter, melted

Wedding Torte #1 Lemon Genoise

From:  The Detroit News Sent By: Teresa Marco

Preheat oven to 350o.  In mixer or copper bowl, beat whites to a stiff
snow; slowly add sugar and beat until stiff peaks form.

In separate bowl, whisk yolks and mix in lemon zest. Slowly fold the
two mixtures together.

Sift together flour and baking powder, and slowly fold into egg
mixture. Fold in melted butter.

Pour into 10" greased and floured cake pan.  Bake for 25-30 mins. or
until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean. Turn cake
onto clean linen tea towel to cool.

BAKED HAZELNUT MERINGUE

4 egg whites 2/3 C sugar, divided 1 C + 1 tsp ground hazelnuts (or
almonds) 1/3 C flour 2 tsp cocoa powder
1/3 c  cornstarch

Preheat oven to 350o.  Whisk egg whites until firm, gradually adding a
little less than half of the sugar. Carefully fold in ground
hazelnuts, flour, cocoa powder, cornstarch and remaining sugar. Pour
into greased and paper-lined 10" cake pan.  Bake for 20 mins or until
a toothpick inserted in middle comes out clean. Turn onto rack and
cool.

BAVARIAN CREAM

1/3 qt. half and half 1/4 C sugar 4 egg yolks 5 sheets gelatin or 1
TBSP + 1/2 tsp unflavored granulated gelatin (if using sheets, soak
for 20 mins. in cold water and squeeze dry; if using granulated,
dissolve in 4 TBSP cold water) 1 oz. fruit liqueur (Grand Marnier,
Triple Sec, etc.) or rum 1/2 qt. whipping cream

Reserve 1/2 C of the half and half and mix with yolks. Set aside.
Bring remaining half and half and sugar to a boil and stir in yolk
mixture; reduce heat to low and cook, stirring often, until custard
coats back of a wooden spoon. Stir in granulated gelatin or softened
sheets and remove from heat to cool.

When custard begins to set, stir until smooth.  Add liqueur and fold
in stiffly whipped cream.  (If making a day ahead of time, cover
surface with plastic wrap and chill. Stir before you use it. Partoens
feels it's best, however, when made early the same day.)

FINAL ASSEMBLY

2 small cartons (1/2 pint each) whipping cream, whipped until stiff 1
small jar raspberry or strawberry jam Assorted fresh fruit:
pineapple; variety of berries, sliced kiwi, and peaches whatever you
desire, just so it's fresh and ripe

On serving plate, place baked hazelnut meringue.  Coat with jam. With
long knife, carefully slice sideways through lemon genoise to make 3
layers. Place on layer on the jam. Spread (or pipe) with Bavarian
cream. Dot with kiwi and peach slices.  Add layer aand cover with
Bavarian cream and sliced strawberries.  Add final layer and frost
with whipped cream. (If desired, pipe a design on the top and around
the bottom with whipped cream.) Arrange fresh fruit on the top.

Optional: Coat fresh fruit with Dr. Oetker fruit glaze, available at
European import shops.

Serves 12.

50 gm flour (1/2 cup less 1 tbsp)
1 dash salt
10 tablespoon liquid honey
1  fat for frying

From grandmother's more thrifty times; rarely encountered today.

From the Oberallgaeu region.

Make a batter of the flour, egg yolk, milk, salt, and sugar. Beat the
egg whites, and add to the mixture. Take five wooden spoons and stick
the handles about 1/3 to 3/4 inch deep into the dough, twisting the
handles as you do so.  Immediately transfer them to fat that has been
heated to 390 degrees F.  As soon as the dough has browned, once
again dip into the dough, then back into the hot fat. Repeat the
process 5 to 6 times. When the very outside layer has turned crisp
and brown, remove the pastry from the spoon handle, fill with honey,
and serve hot, dusted with crushed sugar.

Makes 8 wasp nests, for dessert.

Westmoreland Bistro Pumpkin Creme Brulee

deserts, puddings

3/4 cup canned pumpkin
2 1/4 cup whipping cream
1 each vanilla bean, split in half
7 each egg yolks
1 cup granulated sugar; divided
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1 tablespoon chopped crystallized ginger

Caprial Pence, co-owner and chef at Westmoreland Bistro, included the
recipe for this special holiday dessert in her latest cookbook,
"Caprial's Cafe". This will be a nice change from pumpkin pie for
Christmas.

In a heavy saucepan over medium temperature, heat the pumpkin puree,
cream and vanilla bean halves to a boil and set aside.

Place the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of the sugar in a medium stainless
steel bowl (or the top of a double boiler) and place the bowl over a
pot of barely simmering water. Whisk constantly until the mixture
forms a ribbon when you lift the whisk, about 6 or 8 minutes. Be
careful not to scramble the egg mixture.

Slowly whisk in hot pumpkin mixture to the egg mixture and stirring
frequently, cook over medium heat until the mixture has the
consistency of softly whipped cream, 40 to 50 minutes. Add the
cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and ginger and mix well. Pour into 6
custard cups and refrigerate for 3 hours or overnight.

When ready to serve, sprinkle each custard with 4 teaspoons sugar and
place under a preheated broiler for 2 or 3 minutes or until sugar is
browned. Serve immediately.

Whiskey Balls

3 cup vanilla wafer crumbs
1/2 cup finely chopped pecans
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa
2 cup confectioner's sugar
1/2 cup bourbon
3 tablespoon light corn syrup
1  salt, if desired

1.  Blend together the crumbs, nuts, cocoa, 1 cup confectioner's
sugar, Bourbon, corn syrup, and a dash of salt. Form into small
balls the size of walnuts.

2.  Roll each ball in the remaining 1 cup confectioner's sugar and
place on a cookie sheet.  Chill in the refrigerator for several
hours or overnight.

Note:  It is traditional in the South to use Bourbon, but rye may
also be used. This confection -- or at least a version of it
~- was an early Southern version of those chocolate truffles that
became the rage for chocolate lovers during the 1980s in this
country. The whiskey balls are made, of course, with cocoa rather
than chocolate.

White Fondant

candy

2 cup sugar
1 1/4 cup water
2 tablespoon corn syrup, light
1 teaspoon vanilla or lemon flavoring

Place a large platter in refrigerator to chill.

Combine sugar, water, and corn syrup in saucepan. Cook, stirring
constantly, until sugar is dissolved. Remove spoon. Do not stir candy
again during cooking.

When candy begins to boil, cover saucepan tightly and let boil 3
minutes; the steam formed washes down any sugar crystals. Remove
cover; continue cooking. From time to time, wash away sugar crystals
which now appear on the sides of the saucepan. For this, use a fork
wrapped in a piece of cheesecloth and dipped in cold water. (Or--from
another recipe--use a wet pastry brush.)

Cook to soft ball stage, and 1 minute longer, or 240 F. on candy
thermometer, for firm fondant for molding. (At 238 F., which is soft
ball, fondant is suitable for coconut drops, layers in fudge, et
cetera.)

At 240 F. remove pan from heat; pour fondant at once onto cold, wet
platter. Let fondant cool to lukewarm. Add flavoring. Beat with
fondant paddle, spatula, or wide, flat wooden spoon until fondant
becomes white and creamy. Knead until the mass is smooth and no lumps
remain.

Put fondant away in covered glass bowl or jar to ripen for 2 or 3 days
before using. It may be kept longer if tightly covered. Use fondant as
suggested in various recipes.

"The home candymaker who likes to create professional-looking
chocolates and other candies must be able to make good fondant. This
recipe is simplified from a commercial formula. The fondant remains
creamy and workable. It may be shaped and dipped in chocolate. Some
may be colored with food coloring. Some may be combined with nuts,
coconut, chopped candied fruits or combined in layers with fudge,
caramels, and other mixtures to make logs, squares, and various
decorative pieces for the sweetmeat tray."

Willie's Crisp

deserts

1 cup flour
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1  egg, beaten
5  to 6 cups peeled, seeded, sliced fr; uit, or stemmed berries
1/2  to 3/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoon flour
1/4 lb butter, melted

I love cobblers, crisps, etc., but never make them. This one may
change my mind.  What can you say about a recipe that starts like
this?

"...When I called her, she read me the recipe from a small black cook
that contains, she says, the recipes that have no peer, the benchmark
recipes. Willie's Crisp is part of this collection, and although I
have no idea who Willie is, I do know that his is the only crisp I've
ever had that was crisp. It is perfect on top of fruit or berries."

Preheat the oven to 375F. Have ready an 8 x 8-inch baking dish (no
need to butter it). Put 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, the baking powder
and salt in a large mixing bowl. Stir to mix well. Make a well in the
center of the dry ingredients and add the beaten egg. (Don't add the
egg now unless you are going to bake this right away. The sugar will
begin to melt, and the mixture won't crumble and spread properly.)
Stir mixture with a fork. It should be crumbly; if it seems too dry,
add a little more egg. Put the fruit or berries into another mixing
bowl. Stir together the 2 tablespoons flour and sugar to taste. Add
to the fruit and toss lightly to coat. Spoon fruit into the baking
dish and spread evenly. Sprinkle the crisp mixture evenly over the
top. Drizzle the melted butter evenly over the crisp mixture. Bake
for about 40 minutes, or until the topping is golden. Serve warm with
whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

Windsor Pudding - A Right Royal Treat - :)

british, deserts, fruits

1  butter for greasing
40 gm long grain rice
350 ml milk
450 gm cooking apples
1/2  lemon rind grated
50 gm caster sugar
3  egg whites

The House of Windsor is the correct name for the family our present
Queen Elizabeth II belongs to. This dish was created especially for
her and can now be enjoyed by all of you.

An exceptionally light pudding which is difficult to turn out of its
cooking dish.  For this reason I would always cook and serve it in
the same dish. Placing a small circle of greaseproof/cooking
parchment in the base of the dish can assist in its extraction.

You will also need a saucepan big enough to contain the pudding basin
or or souffle dish, with lid in place.

Grease a 1 litre pudding basin or souffle dish.  Place the rice in a
pan with the milk and cook until tender and all milk is absorbed.
Allow to cool a little.

Peel, core, and roughly chop the apples.  Stew until soft shaking the
pan from time to time in order that the apple does not stick. In the
meantime, half fill a large pan with water and bring to the boil.

Place apple and grated rind of 1/2 lemon in a blender and puree. Stir
in cooked rice and sugar.

Whisk the egg whites in a clean, dry, bowl until they form fairly
stiff peaks.  Stir the egg into the apple mix. Spoon it all into the
prepared basin or dish. Cover with greasproof/parchment paper or
foil, and tie with string. Stand the basin/dish in the pan of boiling
water, after first placing an old plate in the base. The basin/dish
should stand on the plate, and the water should come about half way
up the basin/dish. Put on a tightly fitting lid and steam gently for
around 45 minutes. Serve hot! From Ron's Plaice in Blackpool:)

Meanwhile, using a sharp knife, peel oranges, removing all bitter
white pith. Cut oranges in 1/4"-thick slices and place in a shallow
dish. Strain wine syrup over oranges. Cover and chill several hours
or overnight, turning slices occasionally in syrup.

Using wooden picks, secure orange slices together to form whole
oranges and place in a serving dish. Pour wine syrup over oranges.
Garnish with orange peel, if desired, and serve with half-and-half.

NOTE: If desired, serve oranges in slices rather than as whole
oranges.

Wine Tart

baking, deserts

      ----PASTRY----
140 gm plain flour (5 oz)
1 teaspoon baking powder
60 gm unsalted butter (2 1/4 oz)
1 dash salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar
3 tablespoon milk
1  butter and flour for the  tart tin
      ----FILLING----
120 gm caster sugar (4 oz)
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
10 gm plain flour (1/4 oz)
100 ml good dry white wine (scant  1/4 pin; t)
15 gm butter (approx. 1/2 oz)

This a recipe from the Swiss district "Vaud": both the pastry and the
filling are local specialities.

Pre-heat the oven to 260 oC/500 oF. Lightly butter a tart tin with a
removable base 20 cm (8 in) in diameter.

Pastry: put the flour, baking powder and softened butter together in a
large bowl. Add the salt and sugar. Rub all the ingredients together
with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse semolina. Add
the milk and mix it in lightly and rapidly with your fingers, without
exerting any pressure. Form the pastry into a ball, using it to
collect all the loose flour. If need be, add another drop or two of
milk.

Do not let the pastry rest, but roll it out straight away to fit the
prepared tart tin. The pastry should be only 3 mm (1/8 in) thick and
should extend well beyond the rim. Ease the pastry into the base of
the tin by pressing gently into the corners with a small ball of
dough, but arrange for the spare pastry at the top of the tin to
project as a little horizontal fold or lip about 1 cm (3/8 in) wide
and 1 cm deep inside the tin. There is now much less spare pastry all
round the outside of the tin. Press the pastry down on top of the rim
with your thumb and trim it off neatly by rolling the pin across the
tin.

Press the fold of pastry inside the tin upwards (the rolling pin
should have passed over it without touching it at all). Work fast,
with your fingers inside the rim. You now have a border standing up
all round the top of the tin, with the lower, outside edge firmly
attached to the rim. Pinch this border between your finger and thumb
with tweaking movements, at intervals of 1 cm (3/8 in) to make a
little fluted edge all round the top of the tart.

Mix the sugar, cinnamon and flour together. Strew this mixture all
over the bottom of the tart. (This is a liquid filling so the bottom
of the tart is not pricked with a fork). Pour the wine over the sugar
mixture and mix it with your fingertips. Dot the surface with the
butter, in flakes.

Cook the tart in the bottom of the pre-heated oven for 15 ... 20
minutes, turning it from time to time to equalise the heat and to
prevent bubbles forming.

Leave the tart to cool before taking it out of the tin.

Zabaione Marsala

deserts, italian

4  egg yolks
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 cup sweet sicilian marsala  such as flo; rio or  pellegrino
1  cinnamon

Try substituting other wines (or liqueurs) for the Marsala; a
combination of strong coffee and brandy also makes a flavorful,
though not traditional, Zabaione. BRING A QUART OF WATER to a simmer
in a small saucepan. Place the egg yolks in a heat-proof bowl and
whisk by hand until liquid. Whisk in the sugar in a stream, then the
Marsala. Regulate the heat under the pan so that the water simmers
gently, then place the bowl over the pan so that the bottom of the
bowl is above the surface of the water. Whisk vigorously; the
Zabaione will begin to absorb air fairly quickly. Continue whisking
for a total of 4 minutes, until the Zabaione is very aerated and
thickened. Pour into stemmed glasses, dust with a dash of cinnamon
and serve immediately. Though not traditional, you may wish to serve
the Zabaione cool: After whisking until thickened, continue whisking
by hand, with a hand mixer set at medium speed, or in a heavy-duty
mixer fitted with the whip, until the Zabaione is cool.

Zeppoli

deserts, italian

2 tablespoon butter
1 pinch salt
1 cup flour
3  eggs, whole
1  egg yolk
1  vegetable oil  for deep frying
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar

As made in Naples for the Feast of San Giuseppe, these crullers are
piped from a pastry bag into ring shapes. After being fried, their
centers are filled with pastry cream and cherry preserves. PUT BUTTER
AND SALT into a saucepan with 1 cup water. Boil until butter
dissolves. Off heat, dump in flour all at once and stir rapidly to
mix. Return pan to medium-high heat and cook, still stirring rapidly,
until mixture is smooth and begins to coat bottom and sides of pan.
Remove pan from heat and, one at a time, add eggs and extra yolk,
stirring briskly until each addition is absorbed. Let mixture cool to
room temperature. Put confectioners' sugar into a brown paper bag.
Heat deep-frying oil to 375F. Using 2 teaspoons, drop in nuggets of
dough about the size of a small walnut. Fry a few at a time for
5-to-6 minutes each. As they cook, the zeppoli will rise to the
surface, turn over when their bottom halves are golden brown, and
finally rupture slightly and puff further as the interior dough
expands. Remove them from the oil when golden brown, firm, and hollow
inside. (Check one from the first batch, and if the interior is at
all soggy, cook the rest longer.) Drain zeppoli briefly on paper
towels, then toss in the bag with confectioners' sugar. Serve at once.

bowl; cool to room temperature. Freeze, stirring every 30 minutes to
incorporate frozen portion of mixture back into the syrup.  As
mixture freezes, scrape spoon across the nearly frozen mixture to
break it up. Repeat scraping process every 30 minutes until mixture
is just solid, 3 to 4 hours.

TO FREEZE:  NO-STIR METHOD Transfer syrup to a nonreactive container
large enough for mixture to come 3/4 inch up the side. Cool to room
temperature and then freeze solid. Remove from freezer and allow to
stand at room temperature for 5 minutes.  Invert pan onto cutting
surface. Remove pan and cut frozen mixture into small pieces with a
metal pastry scraper or large knife.  Chop small pieces into tiny
granules. Can return granita to freezer for up to 2 hours before
serving.

GARNISH:  Cut the zest of a large lemon into fine julienne strips.
Cover with water and boil for 5 minutes; drain. Bring 1 cup sugar,
1/3 cup corn syrup and 1/3 cup water to boil. Remove from heat, stir
in zest, and let stand for 30 minutes.  Transfer zest to wire rack.
After 15 minutes, when zest feels dry, roll it in additional sugar.
Can be stored in an airtight container for up to 1 week.

SERVING:  Scoop granita into chilled serving glasses garnish with
candied lemon zest and serve immediately.

Makes 6 servings.

Zucchini bread recipe from Ralph Hunter/114 W. Forest
Ave./Hodgenville, KY 42748 on 08/23/93.  He said he got the recipe
from Margaret Garmon of Cumberland County, Ky., where Ralph and his
wife Edith lived all of their lives until moving to Hodgenville in
April 1993. Mary L. Harmon, my cleaning lady, said it was the best
zucchini bread she'd ever had. Ralph frosted it with the penuche
frosting. The penuche frosting recipe is from _Betty Crocker's
Cookbook_. New York: Golden Press, 1969. Twelfth printing, 1972.

Zwetschgendatschi

bavarian, deserts

1/4 lb butter
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla (or use vanilla sugar)
1  egg
1 tablespoon sour cream
1 pinch salt (only if you use unsalted butt; er)
1 teaspoon lemon peel
1 3/4 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 cup italian plums
      ----OPTIONAL STREUSEL TOPPING----
6 tablespoon butter
3/4 cup flour
1/3 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

In a large bowl, cream the butter, add the sugar (and vanilla), add the
egg, (salt,) lemon peel and sour cream. Mix the flour and baking powder and
add that.

Pit the plums, splitting them into halves or thirds.  Grease the pan and
spread the dough.  Liberally spread plums over the dough, meat side up. If
the plums are sour (as opposed to just tart), sprinkle them lightly with
sugar.

To make the optional Streusel topping, cream the butter, add flour, sugar
and cinnamon. Sprinkle over the plums. Bake for 30-45 minutes in the middle
rack at 375 degrees F. Be careful not to let the bottom burn!

Serve liberally topped with freshly-made whipping cream.

NOTES:

*  A Bavarian plum delicacy for dessert -- My mother and grandmother make
this Bavarian specialty without a recipe; this recipe is from my mother,
after I pressed her to write it down so I could make my own. It also
includes variations from a few other folks that you might like to try.
Roughly translated from Bavarian to German, this is Pflaumenkuchen, which,
roughly translated from German to to English is Plum cake. However,
Zwetschgen aren't ordinary plums, a Datschi isn't really a Kuchen, and a
Kuchen is most definitely NOT a cake!

This dessert is made of the slightly tart Italian plums, which are
unfortunately only available at certain times of the year.  Don't try to
make it with ordinary plums; they're too sweet and too juicy. Yield: Fills
one round cake pan.

*  A Datschi may actually be made with any fruit; I happen to love it with
Zwetschgen the best.

*  I don't know this with Streusel on top, and never prepare it that way,
but several of my acquaintances swear by it. Made with other fruit, I would
be more likely to accept the Streusel.

*  If you like, you may sprinkle rum or cinnamon over the fruit before
baking. Also, you might try substituting rum for the sour cream in the
dough, or just adding both.

*  If you want to make a cookie-sheet-sized Datschi, simply double the
recipe.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 20 minutes baking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.
