 Categories: Crockpot, Chicken, Oven meals
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           -SUSAN LAWRENCE
           Boneless chicken pieces;
           -legs, thighs or breasts
      1    Jar apricot jam
      1    Bottle Russian dressing
      1 pk Lipton onion soup mix
      1 c  Water
      1 lg Onion; sliced
 
  Mix the jam, dressing, soup mix, and water together, pour over the
  chicken, and bake until done. So easy, so good. I usually buy 2 small
  jars of jam - 1 large bottle of dressing and slice up some 'real'
  onion to add just a little cause we eat a lot of chicken. Give it a
  go. IF YOU'RE A CROCKPOT COOKER, mix,leave and return to eat. I
  usually buy bone-less legs due to cost. But sometimes you can get a
  nice large bag of boneless chicken breast at a reasonable price. Bake
  at 350 degrees for about an hour or so.

      4 c  Rye flour
      2 c  Whole bran cereal
      2 pk Active dry yeast
      2 tb Instant coffee

      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Salt
      1 ts Fennel seed; crushed

           -chocolate
      2 tb Vinegar
    1/2 c  -Cold water
      1 tb Cornstarch
 
  In large mixer bowl combine 3 cups of the all-purpose flour, 1 cup of
  the rye flour, the whole bran cereal, the yeast, coffee crystals,
  caraway seed, sugar salt, and fennel seed. In saucepan heat together
  the 2 1/2 cups water, molasses, butter or margarine, chocolate, and
  vinegar just till warm (115 to 120 deg.F) and chocolate and butter
  are almost melted; stir constantly.  Add molasses mixture to flour
  mixture in mixer bowl. Beat at low speed of electric mixer 1/2
  minute, scraping bowl. Beat 3 minutes at high speed. Stir in
  remaining 3 cups rye flour and as much of the remaining all-purpose
  flour as you can mix in with a spoon. Turn out onto lightly floured
  surface.  Knead in enough of the remaining all-purpose flour to make
  a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to 8 minutes
  total). (Dough may be slightly sticky because of the rye flour.)
  Shape into a ball. Place in lightly greased bowl; turn once to grease
  surface. Cover; let rise in warm place till nearly double (1 1/4 to 1
  1/2 hours). Punch down; divide in half. Shape each half into a ball.
  Place on greased baking sheets. Flatten slightly with palm of hand to
  6-to 7-inch diameter. Cover; let rise till nearly double (30 to 45
  minutes). Bake in 375 deg. oven for 50 to 60 minutes or till well
  browned and bread sounds hollow when tapped. Remove from baking
  sheets; cool on wire rack. Meanwhile, in small saucepan combine the
  1/2 cup cold water and cornstarch. Cook and stir till thickened and
  bubbly; cook 1 minute more. Brush over hot bread. Makes 2 loaves.

 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  (2 sticks) unsalted butter,
           -softened
  2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Sifted confectioner's sugar
    3/4 c  (3 ounces) chopped walnuts
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  1. Position rack in center of the oven and preheat to
      375    degrees F.
  
  2. In a large bowl combine the butter with 1/2 cup of the

  a spatula to transfer them to the sugar, tossing them around to coat;
  let the cookies cool completely in the sugar and then sift 1/4 cup
  more sugar over them to coat.
  
  5. Repeat with the remaining cookie dough, using a cool baking sheet
  to bake them and the remaining 3/4 cup confectioner's sugar, divided
  as before, to coat.

      Title: RUSSIAN TEA CAKES (SNOWBALLS)
 Categories: Cookies, Tried
      Yield: 4 Dozen
 
      1 c  Soft butter
    1/2 c  Sifted confectioners' sugar
      1 ts Vanilla
  2 1/4 c  Sifted All-purpose flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Nuts, finely chopped
           Extra sifted confectioner's
           Sugar for covering cookies
 
  Mix the butter, confectioner's sugar, and vanilla, thoroughly
  together. Sift and stir in the flour, and salt. Then mix in nuts.
  
  Chill dough. Roll into 1 inch balls. place on ungreased baking sheet
  (cookies do not spread). Bake until set, but not brown. While still
  warm, roll in confectioner's sugar. Cool. Roll in sugar again.
  
  Temperature: 400F (mod hot oven). Time: Bake 10 to 12 minutes. Amount:
  About 4 dozen, 1 1/2 inch cookies.
  
  NOTE: When rolling dough into balls, use a light touch, and do not
  handle very long. The dough will get hard, and become almost
  rock-like after baking if you over-handle.
  
  This has been a family favorite for almost 30 years. Once you start
  eating them, you can't stop. I've seen and tasted many other recipes
  for "Snowball" cookies, but none have measured up to this one. I've
  had many "rocks" in my time!

      6    Small carrots
      3    Stalks celery
    1/4 ts Salt

      1    Egg
    1/4 c  Water
      2 cn Tomatoes
      1 c  Sugar
      2    Lemons
           Dash pepper
 
  Core cabbage and place in large saucepan.  Cover cabbage with water
  and boil until cabbage is softened. Drain off water. Set aside copped
  onion, pared carrots, and cut celery stalks in halves. In a small
  bowl, dampen bread with water.  Add hamburger, egg, salt and pepper.
  Mix together well. Slice thick stem base off cabbage leaves. Place
  some meat misture on leaf. Fold and roll, place seam side down in
  saucepan. On top of cabbage rolls, place onions, carrots, and celery.
  Pour tomatoes and tomato juice over all. Carmelize 1 cup sugar in
  heavy skillet. Add to cabbage roll mixture. Juice 2 lemons and add as
  final ingredient. Simmer 2 hours uncovered. This recipe says sauce
  pan but I used a 13" cake pan. It doesn't specify degrees, so I
  picked 350.  ???  The cake pan holds the rolls and then the carrots
  and celery can be decorative by laying them horizontally,
  alternating. It makes a pretty dish.  And it is good. Well worth the
  effort.

 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2    Chickens, cut into 8 pieces
           -each, wing tips trimmed
    1/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
      2 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
      4    Garlic cloves, coarsely
           -chopped
      2 tb Balsamic vinegar
      2 tb Dried thyme
      2 tb Dried tarragon
    1/2 ts Coarsely ground black pepper
      1 lg Onion, halved and thinly
           -sliced
      2 tb All-purpose flour
      2 c  Defatted chicken broth
      1 c  Medium tawny port
      1 tb Red currant jelly
      2 c  Dried apricots
           Salt to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
           -to taste
           Cooked noodles (opt)
      1 tb Chopped flat-leaf parsley,
           -for garnish
 
  Marinating the chicken in olive oil, balsamic vinegar, dried thyme and
  tarragon add great depth to a rice sauce that's smoothed by just a
  hint of red currant jelly and enhanced with apricots and tawny port.
  Be sure to use tawny port. With its beautiful amber color and
  slightly dry flavor, it compliments the apricots. Save your ruby
  port, which is sweeter and has a deep red wine color, for after
  dinner.
  
  1. Rinse chicken pieces and pat dry.
  
  2. In a large bowl, combine 1/4 cup olive oil, chopped garlic,
  vinegar, thyme, tarragon and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add the chicken,
  toss together well and marinate at room temperature for 2-3 hours or
  refrigerate overnight.
  
  3. Remove chicken from marinade, scraping off any bits that might
  remain. Reserve marinade. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a
  large, heavy casserole. Brown chicken in small batches over medium
  heat until golden, turning once or twice. Set finished pieces aside.
  
  4. Add onion slices to casserole, reduce heat and cook, stirring, for
  2 minutes or until they begin to brown. Toss onion slices with flour
  and continue cooking, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes longer.
  
  5. Add broth, port wine and red currant jelly. Cook, stirring, for
  another 2 minutes. Stir in the apricots, reserved marinade and
  chicken.
  
  6. Cook over low heat, partially covered, for 20 minutes. Remove
  cover and cook for 20-30 minutes more or until chicken is cooked
  through. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, serve with
  cooked noodles and garnish with chopped parsley.

  *My Note After the starter has had about 3 days to get going good,
  put in refrigerator.   Take  out  what you need to make bread,
  pancakes...put equal amount of flour and water in that you take
  starter out. One teaspoon of this will  make  a  phenomenal amount of
  starter...this is a KILLER sourdough.

      Title: RUTH COCHRAN'S CORN CHOWDER
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      3 tb Butter
      1 sm Onion, chopped
      1 c  Ham, cubed
      3 md Potatoes,
           -peeled and cubed
    1/2 c  Water
           Salt and pepper
     16 oz Canned corn
           -(cream-style or regular)
      2 c  Milk
 
  Melt butter and saute onions until soft and transparent. Add the ham,
  potatoes, water, salt and pepper (to taste) and cook, covered, until
  the potatoes are done (easily pierced with a fork).  Add the corn and
  the milk and heat thoroughly. Do NOT boil. Serve with fresh bread.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A hearty corn soup -- This recipe comes from my mother-in-law and
  is a family favorite.  It makes a good, hearty meal when served with
  fresh bread or rolls. Yield: Serves 2-4 people.
  
  *  If you don't have any ham, you can substitute 6 slices of bacon.
  Fry up the bacon and remove from the pan. Saute the onions in the
  bacon fat and continue from there. Crumble the bacon and add with the
  milk and corn instead of with the potatoes. Bacon gives a slightly
  different flavor. Note that many stores offer canned ham in 6 3/4-oz
  cans, packaged like tuna fish.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: RUZ MA SHAYREEYEH (VERMICELLI RICE)
 Categories: Rice, Syria, Mid-east
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  Rice
    1/2 c  Fideo vermicelli
      2 tb Butter or olive oil
  2 2/3 c  Water or chicken broth
           Salt
 
  "Syrians love this handsome rice dish with its tiny golden brown
  noodles that usually accompanies the wide variety of Levantine
  tomato-based vegetable stews. In Egypt, it's the rice served with
  Mlookheeyeh Soup, the national broth thick with fresh greens and
  herbs. Across the Arab world, vermicelli rice is a simple favorite
  usually prepared with fat-grained Egyptian rice or whatever
  medium-grained rice is available. Tossing the grain in a little
  butter or oil before adding the liquid helps to keep the kernels from
  sticking together. When chicken broth or bouillon is used instead of
  water, you have the original Middle Eastern specialty that inspired
  the packaged mix known as Rice-A-Roni."
  
  1. Egyptian short-grained rice requires at least 1/2 hour of
  presoaking. Some cooks rinse it until the water runs relatively
  clear, soak it for up to 2 hours, and rinse it again several times
  before cooking. Converted rice is ready to use.
  
  2. Crush the noodles between your hands to break them into pieces
  about 1/2 to 3/4 inch long. Saute them in the butter or oil over
  medium heat, stirring frequently, until they are evenly golden brown.
  Add the rice and stir-fry until the grains are all coated and
  glistening.
  
  3. Pour on the water or broth, add the salt, and stir. Bring to a
  boil.
  
  4. When the water level is equal to that of the rice, and little
  bubbly holes have appeared in the rice, cover and reduce the heat.
  Simmer until done. The total cooking time is about 25 minutes.

      2    Carrots
      2    Celery stalks
      1    Parsley root
      1    Onion, quartered
      5    Peppercorns
      1    Bay leaf
      2 ts Salt
      6 c  Water
      2 lb Fish fillets
           -(carp, sole, pike
           -or similar fillets)

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      3 tb Butter
      3 tb Flour
    3/4 c  Horseradish, prepared,
           -cream-style
      1 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
    2/3 c  Sour cream
      2    Eggs, hard-cooked,
           -peeled and sieved
 
  Combine vegetables, dry seasonings and water in a saucepan or pot.
  Bring to a boil; simmer 20 minutes, then strain.
  
  Cook fish in the strained vegetable stock 6 to 10 minutes, or until
  fish flakes easily.  Remove fish from stock. Arrange on serving
  platter and cover with plastic wrap. Chill. Strain fish stock and
  reserve 3/4 cup for horseradish sauce; cool.
  
  For horseradish sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan, then blend in
  flour until smooth, making what the French would call a roux. Add the
  cooked fish stock gradually, stirring constantly. Cook and stir until
  the sauce boils and becomes thick and smooth.
  
  Remove from heat and stir in horseradish, sugar, salt, sour cream and
  eggs. Cool for 15 minutes.  Pour the horseradish sauce over the
  chilled fish and garnish with shredded lettuce.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Fish in horseradish sauce -- This recipe is the first of the 12
  dishes that make up the traditional Polish Christmas-eve meal, which
  is eaten after sundown on Christmas eve. The Polish word for
  Christmas eve is Wigilia (pronounced VI-gee-lee-ah). Its root is like
  the English vigil: waiting for Christ to be born. At the end of the
  Wigilia meal the family goes off to midnight mass at church.
  
  There are usually 12 dishes in a Wigilia meal to symbolize the 12
  apostles, though some families serve 13 because they include Christ
  in their count. The meal starts when the first star can be seen; this
  symbolizes the star of Bethlehem. Although The Wigilia is meatless
  (Advent, the season of penance, continues until midnight), it is
  still festive and delicious. The tradition of Wigilia, though
  centuries old, is still current in Poland. There is no fixed set of
  rules for what the 12 (or 13) dishes must be; the items in the meal
  change somewhat according to location and availability of ingredients.
  
  Nevertheless, all of the dishes are traditional, and in addition
  there are many traditions for the serving of the meal. For example,
  some people place straw under the tablecloth to symbolize the manger
  in which Christ was born. Most families set an extra place, for the
  stranger who might be passing by. This is my family's traditional
  Wigilia meal:
  
  : Fish in horseradish sauce
  : Pike Polish style
  : Pickled beets
  : Pickled herring in sour cream
  : Stewed sauerkraut with mushrooms
  : Christmas eve kutia
  : Almond soup
  : Noodles with poppy seed and raisins
  : Poppy-seed rolls
  : Christmas bread
  : Baked apples with red wine
  : Marzipan
  : 12-fruit compote
  
  With this first recipe you will notice a similarity with my last
  name. Now you know a word of Polish (namely chrzan = horseradish i.e.
  hot stuff).
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 hour.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.  Experiment.

      Title: RYE BEER BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 tb Active dry yeast
    1/2 c  Warm water
      2 c  Dark beer, at room temp
      2 tb Molasses or caramel
      2 tb Lard or vegetable fat,
           -melted
      2 tb Crushed caraway seeds
      1 tb Salt
      3 c  Rye flour
  2 1/2 c  To 3 cups white flour,
           -preferably unbleached
 
  Makes 2 round loaves In a large bowl dissolve the yeast in the warm
  water. Stir in the beer, molasses, lard, caraway seeds, salt, rye
  flour, and enough white flour until the dough becomes difficult to
  stir. Turn the dough out onto a floured working surface and let rest
  while you clean out and grease your bowl.  Knead the dough, adding
  more white flour as necessary; it will be very tacky, but up to 3
  cups of white flour in all and about 8-10 minutes of kneading should
  be enough. Return the dough to the greased bowl, cover with plastic
  wrap, and let rise until double in volume - about 2 hours. Turn the
  dough out, punch it down, and form into 2 rounds. Place far apart on
  a greased baking sheet sprinkled with corn meal. Let rise covered
  with a towel until double - about 45 minutes. If you have tiles or a
  baking stone, heat the oven well ahead to 375 F to warm them, and to
  get a good crust use a device to create steam. If you don't want to
  bother with a steaming device, brush the loaves with cold water
  before they go in the oven and again two or three times during the
  first 10 minutes. If you have tiles or a baking stone, slip the
  loaves directly onto the hot surface; otherwise simply bake the
  loaves on the baking sheet. After 10 minutes reduce the heat to 350 F
  and bake another 40 minutes. Cool on racks.

      Title: RYE CRISPS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 40 Servings
 
  1 1/4 c  All-purpose flour
    2/3 c  Rye flour
      2 tb Cornmeal
    1/2 ts Salt
    3/4 ts Baking soda
    1/3 c  Loosely packed brown sugar
      1 tb Toasted caraway seeds,
           Coarsely ground in a food
           Mill or chopped by hand with
           A knife
  1 1/2 tb Powdered, unsweetened cocoa
      5 tb Plus 1 teaspoon (1/3 cup)
           Butter or margarine,
           Softened
      1 tb Toasted whole caraway seeds
      2 tb Dark molasses
    1/2 c  Water
      1    Egg white, lightly beaten
           And diluted with 1 Tb water
           For glazing the tops
 
  "The cocoa gives a dark color and rich flavor to these unique rye
  crisps. They go well with soups. Try them slightly warmed with cold
  Vichyssoise. 350~F.      12 to 18 minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F.
  
  In the food processor or a large bowl, mix the flours, cornmeal, salt,
  baking soda, brown sugar, ground caraway seeds, and cocoa. Cut in the
  butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal.
  
  Add the whole caraway seeds and mix to distribute them evenly
  throughout the dough. Blend in the molasses and enough of the water
  to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.
  
  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or wax paper and chill for at least 1/2
  hour.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll out to 1/8 inch. With a sharp knife,
  cut into 1-1/2 by 2-1/2-inch rectangles. Place them on a lightly
  greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.
  
  Prick each cracker 2 or 3 times with the tines of a fork. Brush the
  tops with the egg white mixture. Bake for 12 to 18 minutes. The edges
  should be slightly browned, and the center surfaces should be firm
  and resist pressure when touched with your finger.
  
  Cool on a rack. Yield: 35-40.
  
  VARIATION: Substitute anise seeds for the caraway seeds.

      Title: RYE SOURDOUGH STARTER
 Categories: Breads, Jewish, Sourdough
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 pk Dry yeast
      3 c  Water, tepid (80-degree)
  3 1/2 c  Flour, rye medium
      1    Onion, small, peeled and
           Halved.
 
  The 4-cup batch of starter made by this recipe is enough to bake any
  of the rye breads requiring a rye starter, with enough left over to
  serve as the nucleus for another baking. When you "feed" leftover
  starter... which should be done every 2 weeks or so.. add a little
  rye flour and water, using 3 parts of flour to 2 of water. To build
  up a small amount of starter to a quantity large enough for baking,
  do the job in several steps, never adding a larger measure of flour
  than the amount of starter on hand. Let the starter stand at room
  temperature overnight or for up to 24 hours, until it is bubbly and
  no longer smells floury. To increase further, add more flour and
  water in the same proportions and again let the starter ferment until
  it is bubbly enough to use.  Store leftover starter in the
  refrigerator between bakings and "feedings," and for indefinite
  storage, freeze it. Thaw, then feed the starter and let it ferment at
  room temperature before use.  Makes about 4 cups.
  
  1. Dissolve the yeast in 2 cups of the tepid water, then beat in 2
  cups of the rye flour, beating until no lumps remain. Add the onion,
  cover loosely with a cloth, and let stand at room temperature for 24
  hours. 2. Remove the onion.  Beat in 1 cup tepid water, then 1 1/2
  cups rye flour. Cover with the cloth and let stand for 24 hours
  longer. The starter should now be pleasantly sour-smelling, almost
  beery, and bubbly. (Depending upon the temperature of the room, a
  slightly longer or shorter period of fermentation may produce this
  result.) TO USE: The starter is now ready for use and can be
  refrigerated for up to 24 hours before use, without further feeding.
  If you must hold the starter longer before use, the night before it
  is wanted, add 1/2 cup tepid water and 3/4 cup rye flour and let is
  stand at room temperature overnight.

      Title: RYE YEAST BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/3 c  Water
      1 c  White grape juice
      1 pk Quick-rise yeast (1 tb)
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Oil
      4 c  Rye flour plus up to 1/2 cup
 
  Warm the water and grape juice to about 115 F and stir in the yeast.
  Let the mixture stand for about 10 minutes or until it is foamy. Stir
  in the salt, oil, and 2 cups of the flour, and beat it with a spoon
  or mixer until it is smooth.
  
  Add enough of the rest of the flour to make a soft dough. Knead the
  dough on a floured board for 10 minutes. Place the dough in an oiled
  bowl, turn it over so the top of the ball is also oiled, and cover it
  with a towel. Let it rise in a warm (85 to 90 F) place for about 45
  minutes, or until it is doubled in volume.
  
  Shape the dough into a loaf, place it in an oiled 8 x 4 inch loaf
  pan, and let it rise in a warm place again for about 30 minutes, or
  until it doubles in volume. Bake at 425 F for 10 minutes, then lower
  the oven temperature to 350 F for an additional 35 to 45 minutes of
  baking. Remove it from the oven when the loaf is brown and has pulled
  away from the sides of the pan slightly.  Makes one loaf.

  gradually whisk in milk.  Stir in rice, sugar, vanilla and orange
  rind. Spoon into 8 greased 3/4 cup custard cups. Place cups in a
  large cake pan or roaster; pour in enough hot water to come half way
  up sides. Bake in 325-F oven for 55 to 60 minutes or til set. Let
  cool slightly. Run a knife around edge of each custard; invert onto
  serving plate.  Serve warm or cold with sauce.
  
  Red Currant Sauce: In saucepan, bring currants and 1/3 cup water to a
  boil. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer, covered for 5 minutes or
  til currants are softened.
   Using a food mill or sieve, press out seeds.  Return currant puree to

  Put a marshmallow (or 2) on the stick and hold it over the fire until
  roasted. Some people like them lightly golden, others like to catch
  them on fire and then blow the fire out. If you do that, be careful.
  You have to put the fire out quickly or your marshmallow will fall on
  the ground. When the marshmallow's roasted, place on top of the
  Hershey bar, put the other graham cracker on top and bite down. Yum!

    3/4 c  Butter
      3 oz Unsweetened chocolate
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      3    Eggs
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
  1 1/4 c  Flour
      2 c  Preserves (we used 1 c
           -raspberry on one half, and
           -1 cup
           Apricot on the other)
      9 oz (approx) semisweet chocolate
           -chips
 
  We've all heard of Sacher-torte, that wonderfully decadent candy
  chocolate glazed torte with the apricot filling. Well, a while back
  Deb started to make it but realized she didn't really have the time
  on that day and did an experiment instead.  This is every bit as good
  as the real thing and a hell of a lot simpler to do. We wanted to see
  how raspberry was and it was just as good as the apricot, soooo, make
  half and half, or better yet, just do a double batch.  Its sooo good
  for the waistline. Make a few batches of this and I guarantee you'll
  come away looking just like Santa...ho ho ho!
  
  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Grease a 15x10x1" pan.
  
  In a medium saucepan, melt butter and chocolate over low heat. Remove
  from heat; stir in sugar.  Blend in eggs, one at a time. Add vanilla.
  Stir in flour. Spread in pan. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, till done. Cool.
  Spread preserves over top. Melt chips over low heat and drizzle over
  top of pan. Chill to harden.
  
  Cut into small 'brownie' sized pieces and serve.  Best if kept cool.

       ** The "saddle of a rabbit" is the rabbit's back from the first
  rib to the beginning of the legs.
  
  Marinade: =========
  
       Put the saddle of the rabbit in a small bowl with 1 cup of white
  wine and 1 sprig of rosemary.  Chop the carrot, onion, celery, and
  garlic add them to the marinade. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and
  store in the refrigerator for 24 - 48 hours.  (The longer the better
  for the flavor of the rabbit meat.)
  
  Rabbit: =======
  
       Preheat your oven to 450 F.
  
       Remove the rabbit from the marinade and dry with a cloth. Salt
  and pepper the rabbit.
  
       In a medium roasting pan, add 1 tablespoon of butter and 1
  tablespoon of olive oil.  Heat the mixture until the butter sizzles.
  
       Place the rabbit in the pan, skin side up, and brown. Turn,
  wrapping flaps around the filet to protect it, and cook until light
  brown. Place the pan in the 450 F oven and cook for 10 minutes, until
  medium rare. Baste often.
  
       Add the vegetables from the marinade to the pan with the rabbit
  and cook for another 5 minutes, basting and turning occasionally.
  
       Remove the rabbit from the pan and place it aside in a warm
  location. Trim the saddle flaps from the rabbit and chop the flaps
  coarsely.
  
  Sauce: ======
  
       Return the chopped flaps to the pan with the vegetables. On the
  stove top, saute briefly and skim the fat.
  
       Deglaze the pan with 1/2 cup of wine, add the rabbit stock and
  reduce by one-half.
  
       Add the tomato and saute while stirring.  Strain the hot mixture
  through a sieve, reserving the liquid (for sauce) and discarding the
  vegetables. Add the butter to the liquid and whisk until smooth.
  
  Leeks: ======
  
       Julienne the leeks.  Rinse in cold water and drain well.
  
       In a medium saute pan, add 1 tablespoon butter and leeks. Cook
  slowly for 2 - 5 minutes.  Leeks should remain crisp. Adjust the
  seasonings and set the leeks aside in a warm place.
  
  Assembly: =========
  
       Remove the filet of rabbit from the saddle.  Cut the saddle bone
  crosswise and place one section on each of two plates. Surround the
  saddle bones with leeks.
  
       Cut the filet of rabbit into very thin slices lengthwise. Fan
  slices on top of the leeks.
  
       Cover with sauce, garnish with sprigs of rosemary. Serve
  immediately.

      Yield: 16 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Water -- hot

    1/2 c  1% milk -- *NOTE
    1/4 c  Sugar -- **NOTE
      2 tb Margarine, imitation --
           ***NOTE
  1 1/2 ts Salt

           King Arthur -- to 3 1/4
           Cups
           TOPPING:
      1 lg Egg white -- beaten lightly
      1 ts Water
           Pearl sugar
 
  Combine the hot water and saffron, and let sit for 10 minutes to
  soften the saffron. In a mixing bowl, beat together the saffron
  water, milk, sugar, butter, salt, egg, yeast, 2 cups of the flour.
  Add enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough. Knead the
  dough (for about 15 minutes by hand, 12 minutes in an electric mixer,
  90 seconds in a food processor, or in your bread machine using the
  dough cycle), then set it aside to rise till puffy (but not
  necessarily doubled in bulk), about 2 hours. Punch the dough down,
  and let it rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Divide the dough into 16
  pieces, and shape each piece into a ball. Place the balls fairly
  close together (but not touching) in a 12-inch deep -dish pizza pan
  or 9 x 13-inch pan, cover them, and let rise for 1 1/2 hours, or
  until they're puffy. Glaze the buns with the mixture of beaten egg
  white and water, then sprinkle them heavily with pearl sugar. Bake
  them in a preheated 375 degrees F oven for 20 minutes, or until
  they're golden brown. ( watch them closely at the end; because of
  their high sugar content, they tend to brown quickly.) Serve with
  butter or Devon cream. Yield: 16 buns.

    1/4 ts Saffron threads, crumbled
      2 tb Shallot, minced
      2 tb White wine vinegar
      3 tb Dry white wine
      3 tb Heavy cream
     14 tb Unsalted butter, cold, cut i

  In a small heavy saucepan, combine the saffron, shallot, vinegar, and
  wine. Simmer the mixture until it is reduced to about 2 Tablespoons.
  Stir in the cream and simmer the mixture, whisking occasionally,
  until the liquid is reduced to 2 Tablespoons.
  
  Season the mixture with salt and pepper.  Reduce heat to low, and
  whisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time, but overlapping slightly to
  keep the sauce from getting too hot. Remove from heat, from time to
  time, as the butter is whisked in.
  
  Remove from heat and season to taste with salt and pepper. Use with
  pasta and/or seafoods.   Makes about
        1    cup.

  If this thread has you drooling at the mere thought of saffron, here's
  where you can get it.
  
  Listed below are resources which will be helpful if you do not
  already have a good connection with a purveyor of the spice, the
  corms and recipes.
  
  My saffron purveyor for the last three years is listed. I have bought
  many brands in addition to the ones he supplies for comparison and
  have found some comparable in quality but never in price or airtight
  packaging. You need to buy a minimum of 1/2 ounce from him.
  
  A source for liquid saffron, the only one available as far as I know,
  is also listed.  Actually this is saffron extract, not liquid saffron
  in that the threads have been steeped in alcohol and water for a
  month. There is an obvious advantage in measuring but make sure you
  use the extract only when you are cooking or baking. For me the
  alcohol taste is too strong otherwise (for example in a mayonnaise).
  
  ANTIQUARIAN AND OUT-OF-PRINT COOKBOOKS:
  
  Thousands of cookbooks are available with saffron recipes but some of
  the more interesting ones are hard to find. Jim Garrett, owner of
  Buchmann, specializes in searches for older titles and found many of
  my references.

  SAFFRON SWEET BREADS:
  
  They were out the day I went to investigate but the saffron baked
  goods sound delicious:  yeast baby loaves or cupcakes filled with
  dried fruit and nuts. The owner is an Englishman, a famous inventor
  (first automatic doughnut machine, a pastie machine) who loves
  saffron and is still working at age 100.  In this part of California
  saffron breads, cupcakes and cookies used to be available in every
  family-owned bakery because the Cornish miners created a demand for
  them. Several grandchildren wistfully recounted memories for me of
  such wonders from grandmothers' kitchens.

      Title: SAFFRON RICE OR TACHEEN
 Categories: Rice
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Basmati rice
    1/2 ts Saffron (either
           Powdered or threads-
           Let soak in 1 T. hot
           Water for a few minutes)
      3    Eggs
      1 c  Plain yogurt
    1/3 c  Oil
 
  rinse rice several times.  Cook rice in rice cooker or put rice in
  medium sauce pan along with 2 1/2 cups of water. Bring to a boil,
  then simmer with the pan covered about 15-20 minutes or until the
  rice is firm, but not mushy.  Pour out any remaining water (if any)
  and set aside. Beat the eggs, yogurt, saffron water, and oil
  together. It should look like a creamy yellow sauce. Add rice and
  stir until all rice is coated withsauce.. Turn into a 2 quart greased
  pyrex bowl or a 9x9 glass baking dish. Bake at 400 degrees (F)for 40
  minutes. Let cool about 10 minutes. Loosen sides and invert onto
  serving dish.  The outside will be a nice brown. garnish with green
  and red grapes, or chicken or lettuce or anything else you might wish.
  
  note: the original recipe called for diced chicken stirred into the
  mix, but that didn't work well for us. One boy wouldn't eat chicken
  for 5 years after that. But he loves the rice!

  Add the remaining 2 C stock and the saffron mixture. Bring to a boil
  over high heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pan and simmer
  for 15 minutes, or until the rice is tender and all the liquid has
  been absorbed. 4. Lightly coat 4 (8 ounce) custard cups with no-stick
  spray or olive oil. Spoon about 3/4 C of the warm rice into each cup,
  pressing it into the bottom and up the sides. Add about 1/2 C of the

      Title: SAFFRON STEAMED BASMATI RICE (LF)
 Categories: Basic, Healthwise, Persian, Rice
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
 
        3 c  basmati rice -- long grain
        6 c  water
        2 ts salt
        3 TB olive oil
        4 TB plain low-fat yogurt
        1 ts saffron -- dissolved in
        4 TB hot water
  
  This is a master recipe that details certain steps applicable to all
  other rice recipes.
  
  1. Clean by picking over the rice. Basmatic rice like any other
  contains many small solid particles. This grit must be removed by
  picking over the rice carefully by hand.
  
  2. Wash the rice by placing it in a large container and covering it
  with lukewarm water. Agitate briskly with your hand, then pour off
  the water. Repeat five times until the rice is completely clean. When
  washed rice is cooked it gives off a delightful perfume that unwashed
  rice does not have. *If using long-grain AMERICAN or Texmati rice, it
  is not necessary to soak or wash five times. (Once is enough.)
  Cooking rice with salt firms it up to support the long cooking time
  and prevents the rice from breaking up. The grains swell individually
  without sticking together The result is light and fluffy rice called
  Pearls of Persian Cuisine.
  
  3. Bring 6 cups of water with 2 teaspoons salt to a boil in a large
  non-stick pot. Pour the washed and drained rice into the pot. Boil
  briskly for 6 to 10 minutes; stir gently twice with a wooden spoon to
  loosen any grains that may have stuck to the bottom. Bite a few
  grains. If the rice feels soft, it is ready. Drain rice in a large
  free-standing straineror sieve.
  
  4. In the same pot, heat 2 tablespoons oil, two full spatulas of
  rice, 4 tablespoons yogurt, and I tablespoon saffron water; spread
  this mixture over the bottom of the pot and even out with back of a
  spatula. This will help to make a golden crust (_tah dig_).
  
  5. Take one spatula full of rice at a time and gently place it on top
  of the bottom layer, gradually shaping the rice into a pyramid. This
  shape leaves room for the rice to expand. Poke 1 or 2 holes in the
  rice pyramid with the handle of a wooden spoon.
  
  6. Cover and cook rice for 10 minutes over medium heat in order to
  form a gold crust.
  
  7. Dissolve 1 tablespoon oil in 1/2 cup hot water and pour over the
  rice pyramid. Place a clean dish towel or 2 layers of paper towel
  over the pot and cover firmly with the lid toprevent steam from
  escaping. Cook for 50 minutes longer over low heat.
  
  8. Remove the pot from heat. Allow to cool on a damp surface for 5
  minutes without uncovering it. This helps to free the crust from the
  bottom of the pot. Then put 2 tablespoons of rice in a dish, mix with
  remaining saffron water, and set aside for garnish.
  
  9. Gently taking one spatula full of rice at a time, place it on a
  serving platter without disturbing the crust. Mound the rice into a
  cone. Sprinkle the saffron rice garnish overthe top. For a tastier
  effect, you may melt 2 tablespoons butter and drizzle over the rice.
  
  10. Detach the layer of crust from the bottom using a wooden spatula.
  Place on a small platter and serve on the side or arrange it around
  the rice.

      Title: SAFFRON STEAMED PLAIN RICE:  RICE COOKER METH
 Categories: Basic, Healthwise, Persian, Rice
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
 
        3 c  basmati rice -- long grain
    3 1/2 c  water -- see detail
        1 ts salt
        2 TB olive oil
      1/4 ts saffron -- dissolved in
        1 TB hot water
  
  Cooking times will vary according to brands of rice and manufacturers
  of cookers.  The note gives more detail. Refer, also, to the recipe
  for Chelow which details technique.
  
  1. Pick over and wash 3 cups of rice 5 times in warm water.
  
  2. Combine all the ingredients except the saffron water in the rice
  cooker; gently stir with a wooden spoon and start the cooker.
  
  3. After 1 1/2 hours, pour saffron water on top of rice. Unplug rice
  cooker.
  
  4. Allow to cool for 10 minutes without uncovering the pot.
  
  5. Remove lid and place a round serving dish over the pot. Hold the
  dish and the pot tightly together and turn them over to unmold rice.
  The rice will be like a cake. Cut into wedges and serve.
  
  detail --- These cooking times are for the National Deluxe rice
  cooker. The cooking time for rice may vary according to different
  brands of rice cookers. It is desirable but not essential to soak the
  rice in 8 cups water with 2 tablespoons salt for 2 to 24 hours. This
  is especially good for older basmati-type rice. For AMERICAN
  long-grain rice, use only 3 cups of water and wash the rice once.
  Among other long-grain types of rice, choose those that are long,
  thick, and sleek at the tip. Copyright (c) 1994 by Najmieh Khalili

      Title: SAGE & ONION BREAD PUDDING
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 c  Bread crumbs, coarse
      6 tb Butter
      4 c  Onion; diced
      1    Clove garlic; minced
      1 c  Chicken broth
      2 lg Eggs
    1/2 c  Half-and-half
      1 ts Sage leaves, dried
      1 ts Thyme, dried
      1 ds Nutmeg, ground
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  "This is derived from an old Welsh recipe for steamed leek pudding.
  After fiddling around with the ubiquitous onion, I came up with this
  richly flavored bread pudding (and several variations). You could, of
  course, steam it as in the original recipe if you have a nice pudding
  mold, but it's just fine baked in a souffle dish or loaf pan. It's so
  good it makes my toes curl. Try it with roast chicken and a spoonful
  of pan gravy."
  
  Tear bread on a large, clean tea towel and spread to dry for several
  hours. You may speed this process by drying the crumbs on a cookie
  sheet in a 300 degree F oven for about 30 minutes, stirring and
  turning them occasionally.
  
  Melt 4 tablespoon of the butter and add onions. Cook them over lowish
  heat until lightly colored, adding garlic near the end of the cooking
  time. When the onions are done, pour in chicken broth, remove pan
  from heat, and allow to cool.
  
  Beat eggs and cream together in a large mixing bowl. Stir in sage,
  thyme, nutmeg, and pepper. Add cooled onion mixture and bread crumbs
  and mix thoroughly. When well blended, press ingredients down firmly
  with the back of a spoon and allow it to rest 30 minutes to absorb
  liquid and flavors.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Thoroughly butter a souffle dish or loaf pan, or spray with one of
  those nonstick pan coatings. Spoon mixture firmly into pan. Bang the
  pan bottom sharply on a hard surface a couple of times to settle
  ingredients, and finish by pressing and smoothing the top with your
  fingers. Strew flakes of remaining butter over the surface.
  
  Place the pan on the center rack of the oven and bake for about 45
  minutes, or until firm and nicely browned. Do not overbake--remember,
  this is bread *pudding*, not bread loaf. Serve hot or at room
  temperature or cold--they're all divine.
  
  AFTERTHOUGHTS: You may make this a day ahead. Bake it in a loaf pan,
  chill thoroughly, slice, and saute it in butter to go along with
  creamy scrambled eggs and crisp, thick-sliced bacon.
  
  Then again you might layer it with oysters and lashings of dry sherry.
  
  It's no slouch either with ham or pork chops and homemade coarse
  applesauce.

  works best for mixing). Add broth slowly, a little at a time, while
  tossing mixture to moisten thoroughly. Take care to add only enough
  liquid to moisten or stuffing will become sodden. To test stuffing in
  order to see if seasonings are correct, melt a little butter in small
  skillet. Add rounded tablespoon of stuffing to skillet and stir until
  lightly golden. If it needs a more lively flavor, add more sage,
  onions or celery. Makes Enough for 16-Pound Turkey

  Cook sago in water first until they loose the white color and look

  watch out. Pour in the hot milk and bring to a simmer. Adjust heat to
  keep milk simmering vigorously without letting it boil over. Add
  cooked sago (with or without the water), raisins, cardamom.
  
  Let cook for about 20 minutes with frequent stirring. Add sugar and

      1 ds Mustard (opt, or ketchup)
 
  Use a semi-thawed frankfurter, which is easier to cut. With a knife,
  make a straight horizontal slit aboyt 1" from the top. On both sides
  of the frank, make a slit upward so the franks looks like it has 2
  arms. From the bottom of the frank, make a 1" slit upwards, to make 2
  legs. Broil in the oven. As the frank cooks, the "arms" and "legs"
  will curl out a bit, making it look more like a person.  When done,
  remove from oven and decorate with mustard or ketchup. Put on eyes, a
  mouth, buttons, perhaps shoes, etc. Kids love this, especially if
  they can help with the decorating!

      Title: SALAD & WINE
 Categories: Info, Mine
      Yield: 1 Info
 
 
  A major problem in pairing salad and wine is the high acid levels of
  most vinaigrettes, which wreaks havoc on wine, making it taste flat
  and flabby. You can avoid this conflict by making dressings that are
  less sharp but still vivid, with some of the following techniques:
  
  ~ Replace part or all of the red-or white-wine vinegar in a recipe
  with balsamic, sherry, or rice-wine vinegar, which have fuller,
  mellower flavors.
  
  ~ Use fruit juice instead of vinegar. Obvious choices might be lemon
  or lime juice, but think also of orange juice, apple cider, cranberry
  juice, or any fruit juice with a bright flavor.
  
  ~ Replace acidic ingredients with other liquids that are intense but
  not sharp, such as rich chicken, veal, fish, or vegetable stock,
  worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, juices from roasted ,eats or
  vegetables, or roasted garlic pure.
  
  When designing a salad, be sure to include ingredients that have a
  natural affinity to wine. They'll create the link that makes the
  combination work.
  
  ~ Herbs: Lots of wines have herbal notes, including Sauvignon Blanc,
  Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot.
  
  ~ Greens: Strong or peppery greens will want a wine with some
  spiciness to it, like Zinfandel or Petite Sirah.
  
  ~ Vegetables: Roasting vegetables concentrates their flavor and
  brings out their natural sweetness. Vegetables in this mellow state
  work well with deeper, richer wines like Zinfandel and barrel-aged
  Sauvignon Blanc. Grilled vegetables want a wine that "seen some oak:
  to link the toasty, woody flavors, so try a barrel-fermented
  Chardonnay. Mushrooms in particular make a salad more full-bodied and
  earthy, making a red wine, such as Pinot Noir welcome.
  
  ~ Fruit: So many fresh and dried fruit flavors and fragrances are
  found in wine that fruit is a natural bridge ingredient. Apple, pear,
  melon, and even tropical fruit flavors are common in Riesling,
  Chardonnay, Gewrztraminer, Sauvignon Blanc, or Smillon. Rip fresh
  berries and cherries dominate many Beajolais and Pinot Noirs, and
  even hearty Cabernets can have similar flavors. Dried fruit, like
  figs, dried cranberries, apricots, and raisins will link to wine with
  bright fruit notes, such as Grenache or Gamay.
  
  ~ Croutons: Toasted or grilled bread in a salad also works nicely with
  slightly oaky wines.
  
  ~ Nuts: Toasted nuts complement slight oaky, toasty wines.
  
  ~ Cheese: Wine and cheese is almost a clich, but why does it work so
  well? One reason is that the milk proteins in cheese tame the tannins
  and acidity in wine, making the combination smoother. If the cheese
  is very salty, like a blue cheese, pair it with a slightly sweet
  wine, such as an off-dry Riesling. Dry aged cheeses like Parmesan or
  Asiago, with their toasty, buttery flavors, link wonderfully to
  barrel-fermented and aged Chardonnays.
  
  ~ Meat, Seafood, Poultry: These ingredients can tame tannins and
  acids in the same way cheese does, and their fuller flavors and
  textures make a salad bolder and more substantial. Think of grilling
  these ingredients and going for an oakier wine.

      1    Info
 
  % Skip the iceberg lettuce and fill your refrigerator crisper with
  greens that are more nutrient dense, such as romaine, spinach and
  Swiss chard.
  
  % Carrots and beets are good sources of vitamin A; bell peppers,
  broccoli, cabbage and tomatoes add vitamin C.
  
  % Cooked beans and lentils are low fat protein sources.
  
  % Venture beyond pasta to brown rice, barley, couscous, bulgur and
  quinoa. All of these grains are flavorful, easy to prepare and
  filling.
  
  % Turn a salad into a main dish by adding two ounces of a lean
  protein. Try skinless chicken or turkey, broiled lean beef, salmon or
  water packed tuna, nonfat or part skim cheese. For an extra nutrition
  boost, skip the croutons and sprinkle on or stir in a few tablespoons
  of wheat germ. One serving, about two tablespoons, of wheat germ has
  eight essential vitamins and minerals, dietary fiber and 50 calories.
  Discover wheat germ's naturally nutty flavor and crunchy texture.

    3/4 c  Tahini

    1/2 ts Ground cumin
    1/2 c  Chopped parsley
 
  Crush garlic cloves with 1/2 teaspoon salt.
  
  Place tahini in mixing bowl and beat well.  This preliminary beating
  reduces the strong flavour of the tahini.
  
  Beat in garlic and vinegar.  Gradually add lemon juice alternately
  with water.  To make a cream salad of good consistency add enough
  lemon juice to make the tahini very thick before adding water. This
  way you have more scope in adjusting the flavour and consistency of
  the sauce.
  
  Add salt to taste, and more lemon juice if a sharper sauce is
  required. Blend in cumin and parsley and chill until required. Serve
  as a mazza or as directed in recipes.

  Starting a day ahead, wash the chick-peas in a sieve under cold
  running water, then place them in a large bowl or pan and add enough
  cold water to cover them by 2 inches. Soak at room temperature for at
  least 12 hours. Drain the peas and place them in a small, heavy
  saucepan. Add enough fresh water to cover them completely and bring
  to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer partially
  covered for about 1 1/2 hours, replenishing the liquid with boiling
  water from time to time if necessary to keep the peas covered
  throughout the cooking period. When done, the peas should be tender
  to the bite but still somewhat firm. Drain and cool to room
  temperature. Just before serving, combine the parsley, onions,
  garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, salt and cayenne pepper in a salad
  bowl, and beat them together with a fork.  Add the chick-peas and
  toss gently to coat the peas evenly with the dressing. Taste for

      4    Thai chile, whole dried
           Cinnamon stick, 2"
  1 1/2 ts Cumin, whole
      2 ts Ginger, fresh

      2 lg Onion

  1 1/2 tb Sugar

MMMMM-----------------------POTATO STRAWS----------------------------
           Oil; for deep frying
      1 lg Potato, red; peeled
      1 tb Salt
 
  Peel and cut the onions in half lengthwise, then cut them crosswise
  into very fine half-rings.  Mix tomato paste and water. Break up
  cinnamon stick somewhat. Peel ginger and grate finely.
  
  Cut the chicken into serving pieces.  I say if you do it right, you
  get 11 pieces:  two wings, two drumsticks, two thighs, a back, two
  breast halves, the pulleybone, and the giblets. This means cut it up
  yourself, rather than leave it to some idiot with a meat saw at the
  supermarket.
  
  Put the chiles, cinnamon, cumin seeds, cardamom pods and cloves into a
  spice grinder or coffee grinder and grind as fine as possible. If you
  don't have a spice grinder, use a mortar and pestle and be prepared
  to take forever getting the spices to the proper degree of powder.
  Put the chicken in a large bowl, and add 1 t. of the ginger, 1/2 t.
  of the garlic, and half the ground spices. Mix well with your hands,
  rubbing the seasonings into the chicken. Set aside for 1 hour.
  
  Put the apricots in a small pan with 2 cups of water. Bring to a
  boil. Turn the heat down and simmer, uncovered, until the apricots
  are tender but not mushy.  When the apricots are tender, turn off the
  heat and let the sit in their own juice.
  
  When the chicken is through marinating, heat the 6 T. of oil in a wok
  or very large, heavy skillet.  When hot, put in the onions. Stir and
  fry until they turn a rich, reddish-brown color. Turn the heat down
  to medium and add the rest of the ginger and garlic. Stir once or
  twice, and add the remaining ground spices. Stir once or twice and
  put in all the chicken. Stir and brown the chicken lightly for 5
  minutes. Now put in the tomato paste liquid and the salt. Bring to a
  boil. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer gently for 20
  minutes. Add the vinegar and sugar. Stir to mix. Cover again and
  simmer for another 10 minutes. Turn off the heat, and skim off as
  much of the fat as possible.
  
  Put the apricots into the pan with the chicken.  If the apricots were
  only sitting in about 2 or 3 tablespoons of liquid, put that in the
  pan. If there is more liquid than that, discard the extra. Gently
  slip the apricots in between the chicken pieces and let them soak in
  the sauce for at least 3 minutes.
  
  Make the potato straws:  fill a large bowl with about 2 quarts of
  water. Add the salt and mix. Grate the potato as coarsely as
  possible. Put the potato into the bowl of water. Stir the potatoes
  around with your hand. Now remove the potatoes from the water, a
  handful at a time, squeezing out as much water as possible. Spread
  the potatoes on a dish towel. Pat with paper towels to dry off as
  much moisture as possible.
  
  Pour vegetable oil into a wok or cast-iron frying pan to a depth of 2
  inches.  Heat over a low heat, and let the oil heat slowly. Don't try
  to force it. When it is hot--this may be 10 minutes or so--put in a
  smallish handful of the uncooked potato straws, which will begin to
  bubble. When they stop bubbling, stir them until they are crisp and a
  pale gold color. Remove with a wire spoon or slotted spoon and leave
  to drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Continue and repeat
  until all the potato is used. When ready to eat, put the chicken in a
  warmed serving dish and garnish with the potato straws.

      Title: SALI JARDALOO MURGI (CHICKEN WITH APRICOTS AN
 Categories: Indian, Chicken
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 lb Chicken, skinned
      4    Thai chile, whole dried
           Cinnamon stick, 2"
  1 1/2 ts Cumin, whole
      2 ts Ginger, fresh
      1 ts Garlic, finely crushed
     15    Apricots, dried, pitted
      6 tb Oil
      2    Onion, large
      2 tb Tomato paste
      1 c  Water
  1 1/4 ts Salt
      2 tb White malt vinegar
  1 1/2 tb Sugar

MMMMM-----------------------POTATO STRAWS----------------------------
           Oil, for deep frying
      1    Potato, large red, peeled
      1 tb Salt
 
  Approx. Cook Time:  4:00
  
  Peel and cut the onions in half lengthwise, then cut them crosswise
  into very fine half-rings.  Mix tomato paste and water. Break up
  cinnamon stick somewhat. Peel ginger and grate finely.
  
  Cut the chicken into serving pieces.  I say if you do it right, you
  get 11 pieces:  two wings, two drumsticks, two thighs, a back, two
  breast halves, the pulleybone, and the giblets. This means cut it up
  yourself, rather than leave it to some idiot with a meat saw at the
  supermarket.
  
  Put the chiles, cinnamon, cumin seeds, cardamom pods and cloves into a
  spice grinder or coffee grinder and grind as fine as possible. If you
  don't have a spice grinder, use a mortar and pestle and be prepared
  to take forever getting the spices to the proper degree of powder.
  
  Put the chicken in a large bowl, and add 1 t. of the ginger, 1/2 t.
  of the garlic, and half the ground spices. Mix well with your hands,
  rubbing the seasonings into the chicken. Set aside for 1 hour.
  
  Put the apricots in a small pan with 2 cups of water. Bring to a boil.
  
  Turn the heat down and simmer, uncovered, until the apricots are
  tender but not mushy.  When the apricots are tender, turn off the
  heat and let the sit in their own juice.
  
  When the chicken is through marinating, heat the 6 T. of oil in a wok
  or very large, heavy skillet.  When hot, put in the onions. Stir and
  fry until they turn a rich, reddish-brown color. Turn the heat down
  to medium and add the rest of the ginger and garlic. Stir once or
  twice, and add the remaining ground spices. Stir once or twice and
  put in all the chicken. Stir an brown the chicken lightly for 5
  minutes. Now put in the tomato paste liquid and the salt. Bring to a
  boil. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer gently for 20
  minutes. Add the vinegar and sugar. Stir to mix. Cover again and
  simmer for another 10 minutes. Turn off the heat, and skim off a much
  of the fat as possible.
  
  Put the apricots into the pan with the chicken.  If the apricots were
  only sitting in about 2 or 3 tablespoons of liquid, put that in the
  pan. If there is more liquid than that, discard the extra. Gently
  slip the apricot in between the chicken pieces and let them soak in
  the sauce for at least 3 minutes.
  
  Make the potato straws:  fill a large bowl with about 2 quarts of
  water. Add the salt and mix. Grate the potato as coarsely as possible.
  
  Put the potato into the bowl of water. Stir the potatoes around with
  your hand. Now remove the potatoes from the water, a handful at a
  time, squeezing out as much water as possible. Spread the potatoes on
  a dish towel. Pat with paper towels to dry off as much moisture as
  possible.
  
  Pour vegetable oil into a wok or cast-iron frying pan to a depth of 2
  inches.  Heat over a low heat, and let the oil heat slowly. Don't try
  to force it. When it is hot--this may be 10 minutes or so--put in a
  smallish handful of the uncooked potato straws, which will begin to
  bubble. When they stop bubbling, stir them until they are crisp and a
  pale gold color. Remove with a wire spoon or slotted spoon and leave
  to drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Continue and repeat
  until all the potato is used. When ready to eat, put the chicken in a
  warmed serving dish and garnish with the potato straws.

  I've always like Salisbury steak, but I had to search a long time to
  find a recipe this tasty. It's handy, too, because it can be prepared

  be a little different. That's how I developed this one, and I never
  fail to get compliments on it! ~ Sally Grisham In a large kettle or
  Dutch oven, cook bacon until crisp; remove to paper towel to drain.
  Drain all but 3 Tbsp. drippings. Brown stew meat in the drippings.
  Add onions and garlic; cook until onions are soft. Return bacon to

  cheese. Bring to a boil; reduce heat. Cover and simmer until beef is
  tender, about 3-4 hours. Add beans and heat through. Top each serving

           -pastry
           Rice Filling, chilled
           -(recipe follows)
           Mushroom-Spinach Filling,
           -chilled (recipe follows)
  1 1/2 lb Poached salmon, boned and
           -flaked, chilled
      1    Egg
      2 ts Half and half
      2    (lOx4-inch) sheets puff
           -pastry
 
  Salmon coulibiac is a traditional Yule holiday dish in Russia because
  it looks like a present: red (salmon) and green (spinach), all
  gift-wrapped in puff pastry. This dish would also be ideal on a New
  Year's Eve or Twelfth Night buffet. Here's a salmon coulibiac from
  Just Off Melrose caterers in Hollywood.
  
  Cucumber-Dill Sauce (recipe follows)
  
  Place 2 (15xl2-inch) puff pastry sheets side by side on floured
  board. For each puff pastry, spoon 1/4 Rice Filling evenly over
  center of each pastry. Add Mushroom Spinach Filling evenly on top of
  rice mixture. Distribute flaked salmon evenly over mushroom mixture.
  Top each with remaining Rice Filling.
  
  Beat egg with half and half in small bowl to make egg wash. Brush
  edges of pastry with egg wash. Fold pastry lengthwise, overlapping
  edges. Tuck ends to seal. Turn over, seam-side down, onto greased
  baking sheet. Make cutouts from remaining (lOx4-inch) puff pastry
  sheets, using pastry cutters. Place on top and sides of pastry roll.
  Make vent in center of roll and brush entire surface and cutouts with
  egg mixture. Bake at 350 degrees 45 minutes, or until golden brown.
  Remove and allow to cool 10 minutes before slicing. Serve hot or at
  room temperature with Cucumber Dill Sauce. Makes about 10 servings.
  
  Rice Filling
  
  2 tbs butter 1/2 cup chopped shallots 2 cloves garlic, minced 3 cups
  cooked rice 1 bunch fresh dill, chopped
  
  Melt butter in skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and garlic.
  Saute until shallots are tender. Add rice and dill and mix well.
  
  Mushroom-Spinach Filling
  
  1/4 cup butter 1 onion, chopped 1/2 pound mushrooms, sliced 1/4-inch
  thick 1 (IO-ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and
  squeezed dry Salt, pepper
  
  Melt butter in small skillet. Add onion and saute until tender, about
  1 minute. Add mushrooms and spinach and cook 3 minutes. Season to
  taste with salt and pepper.
  
  Cucumber-Dill Sauce
  
  2 tbs butter 1/4 cup minced shallots 1 1/2 tsp flour 1 cup half and
  half 1 cup sour cream 1/2 cup chopped fresh dill Salt, pepper 1/4 cup
  grated peeled cucumber
  
  Melt butter in small skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and saute
  until translucent. Stir in flour and cook 1 minute. Stir in half and
  half and simmer until slightly thickened. Add sour cream and dill.
  Season to taste with salt and pepper. Heat through, but do not boil.
  Add cucumber just before serving. Makes 2 1/2 cups.

      Title: SALMON COULIBIAK
 Categories: Fish, Harned 1994, Main dish, Russian, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
     14 oz Pkg. frozen puff pastry
 17 1/2 oz Can cohoe salmon
    1/2 lb Fresh mushrooms
           -- finely chopped
    1/2 c  Finely chopped onion
      3 tb Unsalted butter
      1 ts Lemon juice
      3 lg Eggs plus
      1    Egg yolk; for pastry glaze
           Chicken stock
      3 c  Long-grain rice
           -- cooked in chicken stock
      4    Fresh dill sprigs
           Salt and pepper; to taste
      1 c  Medium-thick bechamel sauce*
 
  *Well-seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg and tarragon.
  
  Thaw puff pastry in refrigerator overnight.
  
  Flake salmon, discarding bones but reserving juices to add to white
  sauce.
  
  Mince mushrooms and onions; saute in butter and lemon juice until
  liquid has evaporated.  Chill (or freeze) in airtight container, if
  preparing in advance.
  
  Hard-cook the 3 eggs.  Peel and slice.
  
  Make the bechamel sauce, adding juice from salmon.
  
  Lightly grease a large cookie sheet (12 x 18"); set aside. On pastry
  cloth, roll out pastry dough to form a rectangle about 12 x 15" and
  about 1/4" thick.
  
  To assemble the dish, build layers along the center of dough as
  follows. Season each well.  Spoon on: half the rice; half the
  mushroom-onion mixture; 1/3 the white sauce; all the flaked salmon;
  1/3 white sauce; fresh dill sprigs; sliced eggs; rest of
  mushroom-onion blend; rest of white sauce; and rest of rice.  (Note:
  The rice absorbs cooking juices and keeps pastry from being soggy.)
  Season top.
  
  Fold dough over filling, folding and turning up ends. Cut off any
  excess dough.  Seal pastry edges on top and at each end with egg yolk
  glaze (one egg yolk mixed with a little milk or water). I like to
  shape the dough into a fish shape, head and tail at either end. Brush
  pastry with glaze.
  
  Carefully lift ends of pastry cloth and roll coulibiak over onto
  greased cookie sheet so seam is on the bottom.
  
  Decorate top with cutouts of leftover dough (make eyes, fins and
  scales if desired).  Be sure to put several slits into the pastry to
  allow steam to escape.  Assembled coulibiak can be refrigerated up to
  several hours before baking if necessary.
  
  Bake in a preheated 400 F. oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until crust
  is golden and juices start to appear. Watch crust carefully. If
  browning too quickly, turn heat down to 375 F. and cook 10 minutes
  longer. Allow to stand 10 minutes at room temperature.
  
  To serve, loosen bottom of coulibiak with 2 spatulas and slide onto a
  heated platter or serving tray. Slice into crosswise pieces to serve.
  Good served with a crisp tossed salad.
  
  Yield: 6 to 8 servings.
  
  Enright writes: "Former cooking school instructor Stephanie Woroshyl
  taught me how to prepare this elegant Russian dish...Most of the
  steps can be done a day or two in advance, making it ideal for
  impressive entertaining."

    250 g  Couscous
    900 ml Hot water
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      2    Garlic cloves; crushed
      1    Green or red chili pepper
           - de-seeded, finely chopped

      1 lg Onion; chopped
      2    Courgette
           - trimmed & thickly sliced
      2    Carrots; trimmed and sliced
      1    Red or orange pepper
           - de-seeded and sliced
    300 ml Vegetable or chicken stock
    1/4 ts Salt
      3    Tomatoes; thickly chopped
     15 g  Margarine or butter
      2 tb Pumpkin seeds
 
  [If you do not have a couscousier in which to cook this recipe,
  improvise by using a saucepan and colander. Line the colander with a
  muslin cloth, allowing the sides of the cloth to hang over the edge.
  Roll up the hanging muslin to make a collar around the edge of the
  colander. During the method, the base of the couscousier is
  equivalent to the saucepan and the top to the lined colander.]
  
  Drain the can of salmon, reserving the juice. Set aside.
  
  Soak the couscous for 20 minutes in a large bowl of hot water. Heat
  the oil in the base of the couscousier, stir in the garlic, chilli
  pepper, caraway seeds, onion, courgette, carrot and pepper. Cook
  gently for 5 minutes. Add the salmon juice and stock to the
  vegetables. Put the top of the couscousier on and place the soaked
  couscous into it. Season with salt. Cover with a lid and steam for 30
  minutes.
  
  Remove the top of the couscousier and add the tomatoes and salmon.
  Heat for 5 minutes. Place the couscous onto a large serving plate and
  gently stir in the margarine and the pumpkin seeds. Pile the salmon
  alongside to serve.

  NOTE: I usually make patties. Then you don't have to deep-fry. Just
  put a little oil in a skillet and fry until golden brown. We also put
  worcestershire sauce on them when I serve them without the sauce and
  peas. Delicious on crackers too!

 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Salmon fillet or steak
    1/2 c  Half-and-half or milk (or
           -less)
    1/2 ts Minced fresh dill, chopped
           -chives, or basil
           -Salt (optional)
 
  This is the easiest way I know to cook tender and delicate salmon.
  It's especially good prepared with fresh dillQbut if you prefer
  chives or basil, it's still a delightful dish.
  
  Preheat oven to 350!F. Place salmon in shallow baking dish and add
  half and-half or milk so fish is half immersed. Sprinkle with dill,
  chives or basil, and salt if desired. Bake 30 minutes, occasionally
  spooning some of the half-and-half or milk over salmon. Check for
  doneness; when fish is predominately pale pink but is still a
  somewhat darker pink in center, it's done.
  
  Makes one serving.

  1/2 times as wide. Place a fillet in the centre of the pastry, spread
  over the white fish paste and sandwich with the other fillet. Cut
  diagonal lines along each side of the puff pastry about 1/2 inch
  apart, leaving 3 inches at each end uncut. Bring the sides together,
  criss-cross the cut strips over each other and secure them with
  beaten egg. Fold one end into a triangle to make the shape of a fish
  head and cut a wedge from the other end to make the shape of a tail

      Title: SALMON FILLETS WITH A HORSERADISH CRUST
 Categories: Appetizers, Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Salmon fillets skinned
           Flour, for dredging
      1 tb Vegatable oil
      1 tb Butter
           Seasoning
           Cooked buttered spinach to
           Serve
           **For the chive sauce**
    250 ml Double cream
      1 ts Dijon mustard
      1 ts Prepared english mustard
      1 ts Creamed horseradish
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
      1 tb Snipped fresh chives
           **For the crust**
      2 tb Creamed horseradish
      1    Egg yolk
  3 1/2 oz Course fresh breadcrumbs
      1 tb Chopped fresh parsley
 
  1. Make the sauce: Boil the cream in a pan for 2 minutes until
  slightly thickened.  Remove from the heat and whisk in the dijon and
  English mustards, horseradish and lemon juice; cover and set aside.
  
  2. Prepare the salmon: if there are any bones remaining, remove them
  with a pair of tweezers.  Cut the fish into 4 equal portions, season
  each piece and dredge with the flour.
  
  3. Prepare the crust: mix the horseradish and egg yolk on a plate.
  Dip the top of each piece of salmon in the horseradish mixture (or
  brush it on with a pastry brush), making sure that it is generously
  coated. Mix together the breadcrumbs and parsley and dip the coated
  side of the fish in the mixture. Using your hands, shape the crust by
  gently but firmly manipulating the coating mixture.
  
  4. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.  Heat the oil in a heavy-based
  frying pan until very hot.  Add the salmon, crust side down, and the
  butter and cook for about 3 minutes until the breadcrumbs are turning
  nicely crisp. Turn over the salmon and place, crust side up, in an
  ovenproof dish. Bake in the oven for 5 minutes, then remove and check
  that the salmon is cooked.
  
  5. Add the chives to the sauce.  Reheat briefly over a low heat, but
  do not allow to boil as this will spoil the flavour.
  
  6. Lay a bed of buttered spinach on each of four warmed plates and
  top with salmon.  Surround the salmon and spinach with the sauce and
  serve immediately.

      Title: SALMON FOR LOUISE
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     12 oz Fillets of salmon dusted
           -with flour
    1/4 c  Clarified butter
    1/2 ts Minced garlic
    1/2 ts Minced shallot
      2 tb Julienne-cut roasted red
           -Christy peppers
      1 ts Chopped cilantro
    1/2 c  Sliced chanterelle
           -mushrooms
    1/4 c  Dry sherry
    1/4 c  Fish stock
    1/4 c  Cream
      2 tb Madeira
           -Creme Fraiche
           -Cilantro sprigs
 
  Dust 2 6 oz fillets of salmon with flour. Shake off excess flour. In a
  saute pan, heat clarified butter. Add fillets, and brown on one side;
  turn. Add garlic, shallots, red peppers and chopped cilantro and
  mushrooms. With fillets still in pan, deglaze with dry sherry. Add
  fish stock. Reduce over hight heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Add cream.
  Reduce until sauce thickens. Remove salmon  to heated serving plate.
  To the sauce still in the pan, add 2 to 3 Tablespoons Madeira. Cook
  only a minute more, long enough to evaporate the alcohol. Lace salmon
  with sauce, garnish with a dollop of creme fraiche and a sprig of
  cilantro.
  
  ***NOTES: When I made this dish, I didn't have fresh chanterelles, so
  I used a couple of dried Shitake mushrooms which I soaked in hot
  water for about 10 minutes before I rinsed and sliced them. I also
  didn't use any cilantro because my husband hates it. I would have
  loved it myself! The most important note to this recipe is NOT to
  overcook the salmon. I cooked it until brown on the bottom, flipped
  it, proceeded with the recipe, but removed the salmon right after
  deglazing the pan in order to prevent the sa lmon from over an
  overdry quality that is most unpleasant and a tremendous waste of a
  good piece of fish. I used only the tail fillets for this dish,
  eliminating the "bone" problem. I also had no idea exactly what a
  Christy red pepper was, so I used some really lovely roasted red
  pepper. The fish stock I made with the head, bones and tail of the
  fish and added some celery, onion and peppercorns and bay leaf to the
  fish stock, cooking it only 20 minutes to prevent bitterness of the
  stock. I also strained the stock through cheesecloth to eliminate the
  grey cloudy pieces. From the files of Al Rice, North Pole Alaska.

 Categories: Chinese, Seafood, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      3 tb Lemon juice
      3 tb Rice vinegar
      3 tb Light soy sauce
      2 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Crushed Sichuan peppercorns
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black popper
      1 tb Dry Sherry
      1 tb Sesame oil
      2 tb Minced fresh ginger root
      2 tb Peanut oil
      1 lb Salmon fillet, in I or 2
           -pieces
      1 tb Cornstarch
      2    Cloves garlic, peeled and
           -minced
      2 tb Minced scallions
      1 tb Minced cilantro
 
  Check this one out.  It has "pesto" in the title, but has no basil in
  it and is a Chinese recipe.  Hmmm...
  
  In a small bowl, combine lemon juice, rice vinegar, 2 Tbs. light soy
  sauce, sugar, salt, Sichuan peppercorns and black pepper. Set aside.
  In a separate bowl, combine remaining I Tbs. soy sauce, Sherry,
  sesame oil and 1 Tbs. ginger.  Rub fish with mixture and marinate for
  at least 20 minutes. (This can be done several hours in advance.)
  
  Fill a large pan with water and bring to rapid boil. Meanwhile, place
  a layer of foil in a Chinese steamer tray, covering tray except for 1
  inch around edges to allow steam to circulate. Rub foil with a little
  peanut oil.  Lay salmon on foil in tray and place tray over boiling
  water. Cover and steam salmon until light pink, just firm to touch
  and flakes when tested with fork. (A 1/2-inch-thick fillet should
  take about 5 minutes.)
  
  In a small bowl, combine cornstarch with 1 Tbs. cold water. Place a
  10-inch saute pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 Tbs. peanut oil. When
  hot, add remaining ginger and garlic. Saute for 15 seconds, then add
  lemon juice mixture.  Bring to slow boil, stir in scallions and
  cilantro, then stir in small amount cornstarch mixture to lightly
  thicken sauce. Remove from heat.
  
  When salmon is cooked, remove steamer tray and lift fish out on foil.
  Slide fish onto platter or dinner plates. Spoon sauce over fish.
  Serve at once.
  
  Serves 2 as a main course, 6 as part of a multi-course Asian dinner.
  
  NOTE:  Salmon is excellent served at room temperature or eaten cold
  while you stand in front of the refrigerator. The pesto sauce is good
  on any steamed, baked, broiled, or grilled firm-fleshed fish fillet.

    1/4 ts White pepper
    1/4 c  Cold water
    1/2 c  Thinly sliced mushrooms

      2 tb Fish stock
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
    3/4 c  Mayonnaise
 
  ~------------ FOR THE SAUCE:--------- HEAT THE OVEN TO 350F. Cut
  salmon into 1/2-inch cubes, and place in a single layer in a medium
  oven-proof skillet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and set aside.
  Sprinkle the gelatin on the cold water to soften, and set aside.
  Bring the fish stock to a boil. Pour the boiling stock over the
  salmon in the pan and cook over medium-high heat until the stock
  returns to a boil. Transfer to the oven and bake, covered with a
  sheet of buttered parchment or waxed paper, for 1 to 2 minutes. The
  salmon should remain pink inside. Strain the mixture, reserving the
  salmon and stock in separate bowls. Melt the butter in a medium
  saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook the mushrooms and shallots until
  tender, about 2 minutes. Pour in the brandy, turn the heat to high
  and light the alcohol with a match. Cook over high heat until the
  liquid in the pan is reduced by half. Add the reserved stock and
  reduce again by half. Remove from heat, and stir in the gelatin.
  Combine the reserved salmon, strained liquid, and Tabasco in a food
  processor and puree until smooth. Cool refrigerated until room
  temperature, but do not allow it to set. Whip the cream until stiff
  peaks form, and fold into the salmon mixture. Pour into a
  9-by-5-by-3-inch glass loaf pan, cover with plastic wrap and chill a
  minimum of 6 hours or as long as 2 days to set the mousse. To make
  the sauce: Place all ingredients except mayonnaise in a blender and
  puree until smooth. Transfer to a mixing bowl and stir in mayonnaise.
  To serve: Run a knife along the inside of the pan. Dip the pan's
  bottom into hot water for a few seconds. Turn over onto a serving
  platter. Cut into 1/2-inch slices, and serve with the watercress
  sauce.

 Categories: Sun-dried, Poultry, Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     12 lg Flour tortillas
      8 oz Pkg cream cheese; soft
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine; soft
    1/4 ts Fresh lemon juice
    1/4 ts Ground white pepper
           Sprigs of fresh dill; or
           Dill pickles; cut thin
           -spears
      1 lg Pk moist smoked salmon;
           -thinly sliced
 
  Mix together cream cheese, butter, pepper, and lemon juice. (I do
  this in the food processor). Spread the tortillas, one at a time,
  with this mixture. Lay the smoked salmon slices, slightly
  overlapping, over the cream cheese mixture, leaving one edge of the
  cream cheese uncovered (this acts as the "glue" to hold the tortilla
  together when rolled.) Lay fresh dill sprigs or dill pickle spears
  down one edge; starting with this edge, roll up tightly, "gluing"
  tortilla together at the end with the uncovered edge of cream cheese.
  Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and chill, at least one hour or up to 24
  hours.  When ready to serve, unwrap and slice about 1/2" thick on a
  slight diagonal. TURKEY BREAST PINWHEELS WITH SUNDRIED TOMATO SPREAD
  Same as above, except substitute very thinly sliced turkey breast for
  the salmon, omit lemon juice from cream cheese mixture and add 1/4
  cup oil packed sundried tomatoes, finely chopped; use watercress in
  place of dill. You may have tortillas left over, use the amount of
  spread for each which gives a uniform covering with no tortilla
  showing through, but also not to thick!! If you like capers, they are
  wonderful added to the spread for the Salmon pinwheels. (wrv)

      Title: SALMON PATTIES
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Salmon, canned
           -(either pink or red)
      1 pn Salt
      1 sm Onion, diced
    1/4 c  Bread crumbs,
           -plain or spiced
      2    Eggs
      1 ts Lemon juice
 
  Mix all of the ingredients together in a bowl.  Form into patties
  about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick and 2 1/2 - 3 inches diameter. This
  should make about 8 patties. Fry in oil or butter until brown and
  crispy, or bake in a well-greased pan at 400 degrees until brown
  (about 15 minutes).
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Snack or Main Course -- This is a very nice finger food, great for
  lunch on a hike. Or they can be served hot as a main course.
  
  *  I usually make a double batch.
  
  *  These are great either hot or cold.  If you take them out of the
  freezer in the morning and put them in your backpack, they'll be just
  right by lunchtime.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, especially if you like squishing stuff with your
  hands.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 15 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

 Categories: Fish, Low-fat, Low-cal
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           -JUDI M. PHELPS
  1 1/4 lb Salmon fillets
      2 c  Champagne
    1/4 c  Fresh-squeezed lemon juice
    1/2 md Yellow onion; sliced
      1 tb Capers
      4    5-inch sprigs fresh tarragon
           Several grinds of pepper
 
  Rinse the fillets and place in a shallow pan large enough to hold
  them in one layer.  Add the champagne, lemon juice, and enough water
  to just cover the fillets. Remove the fish and bring poaching liquid
  to a boil. Lay the fish back in the pan in a single layer and top
  with the onion slices, capers, tarragon, and pepper. Reduce heat to
  low, cover, and simmer 4 to 6 minutes, depending on the thickness of
  the fish. Fish is done when mostly opaque but still barely
  transparent at the very center. Remove fish from the liquid, along
  with onions, capers, and tarragon. Drain well and serve immediately
  on warmed plates. This is nice with a wild rice pilaf and a tossed
  green salad.

       ** See recipe for Court Bouillon.
  
       Bring the Court Bouillon to a boil in a skillet. Add the salmon
  and lower the heat to simmer.  Place a sheet of buttered parchment
  paper or aluminum foil, buttered side down, over the salmon. Poach
  until the fish is just opaque in the center, (about 8 minutes), or
  about 10 minutes per inch of thickness; DO NOT OVERCOOK. Remove from
  the heat and cool salmon completely in the broth.
  
       To make up a seasoning mixture, use a small spice or coffee mill
  to grind the sea salt, 1/2 teaspoon peppercorns and chili.
  
       Drain the poached salmon, remove its skin, and cut it into
  1/2-inch pieces.  Place the salmon pieces, butter, Armagnac and a
  pinch of the seasoning mixture into a processor and blend it all into
  a very smooth puree.  Add the shredded smoked salmon to the processor
  and process with rapid on and off pulses just until the mixture is
  blended. There should be visible shreds of smoked salmon.  Transfer
  the mixture to a mixing bowl.
  
       Gently fold salmon roe into the mixture until blended, taking
  care not to crush the eggs.  Adjust the seasoning. Spoon mixture into
  a 4-cup souffle dish, straight-sided gratin dish, or casserole,

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     12 oz Salmon; steamed
      1 lb Frozen chopped spinach; cook
  2 1/2 c  Bechamel sauce
      2    Hard-boiled eggs
      1 tb Chopped parsley
      1 ts Dill
           Salt
           Fresh ground black pepper
      8 oz Puff pastry; thawed, if froz
           -----for glazing-----
    1/2    Beaten
 
  Cook the frozen spinach in a little salted water as directed on the
  package.  If using fresh spinach you will need to cook approximately 2
  pounds.
  
  Drain well and line the bottom of a buttered pie plate.
  
  Mix the cooked, boned and skinned salmon with the bechamel sauce and
  chopped hard-boiled eggs.  Mix in the dill and parsley and pour the
  mixture on top of the spinach.
  
  Roll out the puff pastry 2 inches larger than the pie plate. Cut a 1
  inch wide strip from the outer edge of the pastry. Brush the rim of
  the plate with water and fit the pastry strip around. Lift the
  remaining piece of pastry over the rolling pin and transfer to the
  pie plate. Press the edges together and trim with a sharp knife held
  at an angle away from the dish. To seal the edges firmly together
  hold the knife horizontally towards the pie plate and make a series
  of shallow cuts round the edge. Flute the edges with the thumb and
  forefinger and pull in the flutes with the back of a knife.
  
  To make decorative leaves for a savory pastry pie, cut remaining
  pastry into 1.5 inch strips using the rolling pin or ruler as a
  guide. Every 2.5 inches cut the strips at an angle to make diamond
  shapes. Press lines on the diamonds to make the veins of the leaves.
  
  Make a hole in the middle of the pie by making a cross with a knife
  and fold back each part, arrange the leaves in a decorative pattern
  around the middle and brush with beaten egg.
  
  Bake in a pre-heated 425 oven until pastry is well risen and golden
  brown - approximately 30 minutes. Cover with foil or waxed
  grease-proof paper if pastry shows any sign of browning too much.
  
  Serves 4.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Salmon steaks
           -----court bouillon-----
  6 1/2 c  Water
      1 lg Carrot; cut in 1" pieces
  1 1/2 c  White wine
      1 md Onion; sliced or chopped
      2    Lemon slices

      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
      1 ds Cayenne
 
  Combine the ingredients in a sauce pan and bring to a boil. Reduce

  almonds. Cook and stir over medium heat until almonds are light
  brown, about 4 minutes. Add 5 tablespoons of butter, the lemon juice
  and a dash of cayenne pepper.  Stir until the butter melts and then

      Title: SALMON STEAKS IN HERB BLANKETS
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Salmon steaks, 3/4" thick
      4 oz Butter
      1    Lemon
           Fresh parsley, chives, mint,
           Lemon thyme and tarragon
           -- (or herbs of your choice)
 
  Choose a gratin or baking dish which will take the steaks side by
  side and use some of the butter to grease it thickly. Put the fish
  into it and season with a squeeze of lemon, a generous grinding of
  black pepper and a little salt.  Cover and set aside in a cool place
  until ready to cook.
  
      To cook, simply dot the fish with the remaining butter, cover
  with foil and bake at 375-400 F (190-200 C) gas mark 5-6 for 20 to 25
  minutes until the fish is hot and tender. While it cooks, chop
  coarsely and mix together heady handfuls of aromatic herbs.  I would
  probably use something like 8 tablespoons parsley, 6 of chives, 4 of
  mint and no more than 2 teaspoons each of lemon thyme and tarragon.
  You may prefer to use a little dill or fennel in place of tarragon,
  or to concoct some quite different cocktail of your own.
  
      Scatter nearly half the herbs on a warm serving dish and lay the
  fish steaks on a bed of herbs. Scatter more herbs over the fish,
  spoon on the buttery cooking juices then the remaining herbs. Serve
  with wedges of lemon and steamed new potatoes.  (Other vegetables are
  best served as a separate course.)

      2 ts Salt
      4 tb Peanut or corn oil
           White pepper to taste
           Handful of fresh coriander

  SOAK BLACK BEANS in lukewarm water for 5 minutes. Drain, rinse with
  cold water; drain. Combine black beans with garlic, ginger, soy
  sauce, dry vermouth and sugar; gently mash together. Cut 3 green
  onions into 2-inch-long sections and cut 3 into 2-inch-long slivers.
  Put green onion sections and half the shredded ginger on bottom of a
  shallow heatproof plate (like a glass Pyrex pie plate). Sprinkle
  salmon with salt. Place salmon steaks in a single layer on top of
  green onions. You may need to use 2 plates with a 2-tier steamer
  unit. Scatter remaining shredded ginger. Top each steak with 1/2
  tablespoon of the black-bean mixture and half the green onion slivers
  equally over the steaks.
  
  Fill a wok or steamer with enough boiling water to come within 1 inch
  of the bottom of bamboo steamer. When the water comes to a boil, put
  the fish with its plate into the bamboo steamer. Cover. Steam over
  medium-high heat for 10 minutes. When done, remove cover away from
  your face and carefully lift out the plate. In a small pan heat the
  peanut or corn oil until hot and almost smoking. Sprinkle salmon with
  white pepper and scatter the remaining fresh green onion slivers on
  top. Carefully pour the hot oil over the fish steaks. It should
  sizzle. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves. Serve hot with steamed
  rice.

 Categories: Portugal, Condiments, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Vinegar
      4 c  Water
      2 ts Cinnamon
      4 ts Ground cumin seed
      6 lg Cloves of garlic, mashed
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  Mix all of the ingredients in a large kettle and stir well. Add salmon
  slices and stir well so each slice will absorb the spices and garlic.
  Leave in brine over night, but not longer than 24 hours, as salmon
  tends to get mushy.  Remove from brine, roll in cracker crumbs or
  meal and fry in hot oil.  This recipe can be cut down depending on
  how many salmon slices you wish to prepare, but make sure you use 2
  parts of water to
        1    part of vinegar.
  
  NOTE:  Pork chops are delicious prepared the same way, with the
  exception that you leave them in the brine 24 hours or longer.

  taste in a large bowl. Combine cream of asparagus soup with 1 can of
  milk and add some of the resulting prepared soup to the cheese
  mixture. The stuffing should be soft but not runny. Use this to stuff
  each tube of manicotti. Place them side-by-side in a shallow baking
  dish. Pour the rest of the soup over the pan and sprinkle Parmesan
  cheese on top. Bake at 350 for 25 minutes or so. Serve with, what
  else, more steamed asparagus!! YUM! (Asparagus was on sale for
  $1.29/# at Giant last week so I got a bunch. It was the pencil-thin
  kind, too, not those big woody things we'll be getting later on.
  Spring is on its way!

      Title: SALMON-SPINACH LOAF
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Salmon (1 large can)
    3/4 lb Spinach, fresh
      2    Eggs
      2 tb Onion, grated
 10 3/4 oz Mushroom soup,
           -condensed (1 can)
      1 c  Cornflakes (uncrushed)
    1/4 c  Flour, all-purpose
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Rinse spinach thoroughly. Cook
  spinach with a small amount of water for 5-10 minutes, or until
  tender. Discard cooking water.
  
  Clean salmon as desired and drain excess liquid. Place salmon,
  spinach, eggs, undiluted soup, cornflakes, flour and onion in large
  mixing bowl. Beat with electric mixer at medium speed for about three
  minutes or until ingredients are chopped and mixture is blended. Stop
  to scrape bowl and beaters as needed.
  
  Grease a 9x5x2 1/2-inch loaf pan and pack the mixture in. Bake for 40
  to 50 minutes or until set and lightly browned. Cool slightly before
  serving. Do not try to unmold; serve directly from baking pan. The
  finished loaf will have the consistency of spoonbread.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A baked salmon and spinach loaf -- This recipe is a pleasant
  compromise between a salmon loaf and a spinach souffle. It can be
  made with stale spinach and canned salmon. It does not have a strong
  flavor or texture of spinach, as do some cooked spinach dishes.
  
  *  You can substitute concentrated dried cream-of-mushroom soup for
  canned condensed soup, or use a thick flavored white sauce.
  
  *  There is no point in using good-quality salmon in this recipe;
  chum or pink salmon are fine.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking and cooling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

 Categories: Fish and se, Sauces and
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Trout Fillets
           Hollandaise Sauce-----
      2 tb Water
      6    Peppercorns -- slightly
           Crushed
      1 tb White Wine Vinegar
      2    Egg Yolks
    3/4 c  Butter
           Salt -- to taste
      1 tb Lemon Juice
 
  Cut fillets into serving-size portions.  Steam over salted water for
  9-10 minute or until fish flakes when tested with a fork. Remove from
  heat. Carefully remove fish to heated platter and keep hot.
  
  Make the sauce in a double boiler or an oven-proof bowl over a
  saucepan of hot water.  If using the latter method make sure that the
  bottom of the bowl is not touching the hot water or the sauce will
  set on the bottom of the bowl before it is cooked.
  
  Place the water, crushed peppercorns and white wine vinegar in a small
  saucepan and reduce to about 1 tablespoon of liquid. Set aside.
  
  Cut the butter into pieces and soften gently in a small saucepan.
  Remove from heat.
  
  Whisk the egg yolks, reduced liquid and a little of the butter in the
  double boiler.  When the mixture becomes creamy and slightly thick,
  pour in the butter in a thin stream, whisking briskly. Add lemon
  juice and a little salt, and taste for seasoning.
  
  Remove from the heat immediately when it is thick. Should the sauce
  look as if it is curdling, add a few drops of cold water and whisk
  briskly for a few more minutes. This sauce can be made in a blender
  or food processor, but you may find that less butter will be
  absorbed. The addition of 1 tablespoon of cold water with the lemon
  juice will prevent it becoming too thick.
  
  Pour the sauce over the fillets and serve.
  
  Serves 6.

      Title: SALSA ALL' AGRESTO
 Categories: Italian, Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
    1/2 c  Bread crumbs
      1 ts Sugar
      2 tb Chopped parsley
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      2    Garlic cloves, peeled
    1/2 c  Unsalted hazel nuts or
           -almonds
      1 c  Juice from unripened grapes
           -(about 1 large bunch)
    1/4 c  Chicken broth (optional)
 
  Chef Marco Fiorini's family roots are in the Valtellina, one of the
  rugged, narrow Alpine valleys northeast of Milan. Fiorini remembers
  the old people there making this sauce, which dates back at least to
  the Middle Ages. The juice of unripened grapes is used in place of
  vinegar, which gives the sauce a hauntingly tart taste. Where to find
  unripened grapes? In a neighbor or friends backyard arbor, or ask a
  farmer's market grape vendor to bring you some not-yet-ripe grapes.
  
  Put bread crumbs, sugar, parsley, salt, pepper, garlic and nuts into a
  blender or food processor and puree, as if making pesto sauce.
  
  Slowly add the grape juice. At this point the mixture may be heated
  in the chicken broth and served as a warm sauce. Be care- ful not to
  let the sauce boil, or it will separate.
  
  Makes 1 1/2 cups.
  
  Uses: Serve warm as a sauce for fish, veal or chicken. Or omit the
  chicken broth and serve at room temperature or on crackers or bread,
  or as a dip for raw vegetables.

      1/2 ts salt, -- or to taste
  :          Freshmilled pepper to taste
      1/2 c  good quality, dry white
  :          wine
      2/3 c  milk
      1/8 ts nutmeg, -- preferably
  :          freshgrated
    2 1/2 c  (1 28ounce can) Italian plum
  :          tomatoes, peeled,
  :          seeded and chopped, in
  :          puree
      1/2 c  cream (optional)
        1    white truffle, thinly sliced
  :          at the end -- (optional)
  
  In a large, wide Dutch oven or large, deep skillet, saute the butter,
  chopped onion, celery, and carrot until they are soft but not
  browned. Add the ground meats and prosciutto, turning the flame very
  low. It is very important that the meat heat very gently, only enough
  to color it on the outside. Not searing the meat allows it to absorb
  the other flavors of the sauce, and will also make it more delicate
  and creamy. Break up and stir the meat as you heat it. You should get
  it to a uniform pink, not brown color. Add the salt, pepper and wine.
  Simmer very gently for several minutes until the alcohol evaporates
  and the liquid begins to be absorbed by the meat and vegetables. Stir
  in milk and nutmeg. It is important to add the milk before adding the
  tomatoes for it to be absorbed directly by the meat. Cook gently for
  10 minutes. Add the tomatoes. When the sauce begins to simmer, turn
  the flame down as low as you can. If your burner cannot be regulated
  low enough, insert a "flame tamer." Simmer in this way, partially
  covered, for about 4 hours, stirring it gently now and then. Check
  for seasonings and add an additional pinch of nutmeg if necessary. If
  the sauce is being used on fresh noodles (not lasagne), and you have
  a mind to be extravagant, add the cream and the finely sliced truffle
  when it is finished. Stir and pour over cooked fresh pasta.
  
  Yield: Sauce for 1 pound of pasta

  mixture in a blender or processor and puree until smooth. Add the
  chile puree to the remaining mixture and mix well. Salt to taste.
    Variations - Ecuadorians are very fond of adding beans to their
  salsa. The most popular beans are the lupini, which are large white
  beans about the size of lima beans. Just add the cooked beans
  directly to the salsa. Or, add 1 teaspoon peanut butter with the
  chiles in the blender and follow the above recipe.
    Substitute yellow wax hot chiles or jalapenos if the aji chiles are
  not available.

      Title: SALSA DE JITOMATE COCIDA (COOKED TOMATO SAUCE
 Categories: Other sauce
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 md Tomatoes -- broiled
    1/4    Onion -- roughly chopped
      1 sm Clove
           Chop
      2 tb Peanut Oil
    1/4 ts Salt -- or to taste
           Garlic -- peel & roughly
 
  To broil tomatoes:
  
  Many Mexican recipes call for tomatoes to be asodos (roasted).
  Traditionally they are put onto a hot comal and cooked until the skin
  is wrinkled and brown and the flesh is soft right through -- this
  takes about 20 to 25 minutes for an 8-ounce tomato. However, since
  this method is very messy, it is best to line a shallow metal pan
  with foil and put the tomatoes in it. Place them under a hot broiler
  ~- do not have the flame too high or the tomato will burn without
  cooking through -- and turn them from time to time so that they cook
  through evenly -- the skin will be blistered and charred. A medium
  tomato will take about 20 minutes. Blend the tomato, skin, core, and
  seeds to a fairly smooth sauce. The skin and core give both body and
  flavor to the sauce. And never mind if the skin is charred: that adds
  character, too. If the skin is very badly blackened and hard in
  places, then remove a little of it. This method of cooking tomatoes
  makes for a very rich-flavored sauce.
  
  Heat the oil, add the blended tomatoes and salt, and cook over a
  medium flame for about 8 minutes until it has thickened and is well
  seasoned.

      Title: SALSA DI POMODORO
 Categories: Salsa
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 tb Extra virgin Italian olive
           -oil (There is a
           -difference)
      2    Cloves of very fresh
           -garlic, crushed and
           -chopped
     14 oz Can San Marzano peeled
           -tomatoes or 1 lb fresh,
           -ripe whole tomatoes peeled
           -and segmented
    1/2 ts Salt
      5    Very large or 10 medium
           -basil leaves, fresh and
           -unbruised
 
  Heat the olive oil over low heat in a heavy, non-reactive saucepan
  and add the chopped garlic and a grind or two (no more) of black
  pepper. Take care that the garlic doesn't brown. After a minute (no
  more) add the tomatoes and stir with a wooden spoon.  Break up the
  pulp evenly. Add the salt, stir, and let the sauce stew for about 6 ~
  7 minutes over a gentle heat. You don't want to reduce the sauce at
  all. Wipe, but do not wash, the basil leaves.  That may cause
  discoloration. Add them whole to the sauce and cook gently until the
  tomatoes are soft and the basil has released its flavor. Do not
  overcook. Remove from the heat, allow to cool and remove basil
  leaves. They should be dark and wilted. If you follow these
  directions exactly, and use only the finest ingredients, you will be
  very pleased with this sauce. You may find tomatoes label "San
  Marzano Style" or "San Marzano Type." Ignore anything but "Genuine
  San Marzano Tomatoes." Don't waste your money on imitations. If you
  can't find Genuine San Marzano Tomatoes, buy Progresso and save your
  money. And don't waste your money on out of season "fresh" tomatoes
  from your local supermarket. They're nothing but insipid impostors!
  If you've never tried Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Italy you're in for
  a treat. Spend as much as you can afford, and don't substitute Greek,
  Spanish, Portuguese or French oils. They're fine, and they have their
  place, but not in this recipe. And be careful, there are some oils
  with Italian names that are labeled Extra Virgin, but if you read the
  fine print you may discover that the oil is from someplace else and
  has only been packed, or shipped, by a company with an Italian name.
  For garlic, look for large, rounded and well developed cloves on a
  smooth, unblemished head.  Purple colored outside skins are often the
  most flavorful, but the more common white garlic will do.

      Title: SALSA DI POMODORO A CRUDO DI FLAVIA
 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
    1 1/2 lb fresh, sweet, mature
  :          vineripened tomatoes
  :          or sweet, ripe cherry
  :          tomatoes
        4 lg fresh basil leaves, torn
  :          into very small p -- or
  :          chopped
        1 lg clove garlic, finely chopped
  :          or -- passed through a garl
        5 TB extra virgin olive oil
  :          Generous 1/2 teaspoon salt,
  :          or to taste
  :          Freshly milled black or
  :          white pepper to taste
        1 lg ripe (but not spotted) Hass
  :          avocado
  
  Cut out the tough area around the core of each tomato and cut the
  tomatoes into quarters lengthwise. Using your fingers, push out
  excess seeds. Cut the tomatoes into rough dice or chop them coarsely.
  Place the tomatoes in the bowl in which you will serve the pasta, or
  in a sauce dish if using with fish. Add the basil, garlic, olive oil,
  salt, and pepper. Insert a knife into the avocado at the top, where
  the navel is. Cut into the avocado until you reach the seed, then
  make a clean incision all the way around the length of the fruit.
  Grasping onehalf in one hand and the other half in your other hand,
  twist the halves in opposite directions to open the avocado. The seed
  should fall right out. Peel and thinly slice each half crosswise;
  then cut the slices further into small strips or dice. Add the
  avocado to the bowl with the other ingredients. Toss to mix and allow
  to stand at room temperature while the pasta or fish cooks. Makes
  approximately 21/2 cups
  
  Note: This recipe is sufficient for saucing 1 pound of pasta.
  
  Ahead of time note: Make the sauce up to 2 hours in advance. Cover and
  leave at room temperature until ready to serve.

      1 sm Ripe tomato
      1 lg Ripe avocado
    1/4 c  Olive oil
    1/2 ts Red chili paste -- or very

      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Black pepper -- freshly

      1 tb Fresh parsley -- finely
           Chopped
      1 ts Fresh coriander; (cilantro)
           Finely chopped
 
  Cut out the stem of the tomato, then slice the tomato in half
  crosswise. Squeeze each half gently to extract the seeds and juices
  discard them, and chop the tomato into 1/4 inch dice. Cut the avocado
  in half. With the tip of a small knife, loosen the seed and lift it
  out. Remove any brown tissuelike fibers clinging to the flesh. Strip
  off the skin with your fingers, starting at the stem end (the dark
  skinned variety does not peel easily; use as small, sharp knife to
  pull the skin away, if necessary). Chop the avocado into small dice.
  In a large mixing bowl combine the oil, vinegar, chili paste (or
  fresh chili), salt and black pepper, and, with a large wooden spoon,
  mix well. Add the diced tomato, avocado, green pepper, chopped egg,
  parsley and coriander, and mix together gently but thoroughly. Taste
  for seasoning. Guasacaca is traditionally served with grilled meats.

      Title: SALSA MEXICANA
 Categories: Condiments, Mexican, Salsa
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Unskinned tomatoes, diced
    3/4 c  Finely chopped white onion
      6    Serrano chilies, finely
           -chopped
    1/3 c  Chopped cilantro
    1/2 ts Salt, or to taste
    1/2 c  Water
 
  This particular salsa is meant to be eaten fresh as it does not
  freeze well & looses its eye appeal by the second day.
  
  (use just enough to moisten the tomatoes and yield the desired
  texture)
  
  Mix together all ingredients and set aside at room temperature for
  about 30 minutes before using.

  coriander it's sharp flavor.

      Title: SALSA PESTO
 Categories: Sauces, Cheese
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Fresh basil leaves -
           -loosely packed
    1/4 c  Onions - chopped
      2 tb Garlic - chopped
    1/2 lb Butter - softened
      1 c  Olive oil
    1/2 c  Parmesan cheese - grated
    1/4 c  Pine nuts - toasted
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts White pepper
 
    1.  Pick through basil and remove large stems and bad leaves. Chop
        basil fine in food processor.  Add onions and garlic to the
  processor
        bowl and puree.  Set aside in a large bowl.
    2.  Put one stick of butter into the processor and give it a whirl.
        Add half the olive oil, followed by another stick of butter,
  followed
        by the other half of the olive oil, blending well as you go
  until you
        have a thick liquid.
    3.  Pour butter-oil mixture into the bowl with the basil puree. Add
        Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper.  Stir well until completely
  blended.
    NOTE: When making pasta with pesto, put hot cooked pasta into a
    skillet over medium heat.  Spoon four tablespoons of pesto sauce
  over
    the pasta and, with a kitchen fork, toss and blend with the pasta.
  The
    sauce will break if you put it into the skillet first - always stif
    the sauce into the pasta rather than vice-versa.
    Makes 3 cups - enough for 12 servings.
    Chef Andrea Apuzzo says, "Pesto sauce - green and aromatic - is a
    rich, herbal concoction which has seemingly endless uses. Once you
    make it, you will find yourself putting it not only in pasta (the
    classic pesto employment), but also in soups, on top of chicken,
  with
    fish, and lots of other things.  We make a pesto butter sauce - not
    really traditional, but most delicious.

      Title: SALSA PICANTE #9
 Categories: Salsas
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Tomatoes, canned, with juice
      1 sm Onion
      2    Chile serrano
      1 pn Sugar
           Salt, to taste
 
  Now are we talking about the mild, Old El Paso-type green chiles
  (which are a mild sort of chile poblano), or are we talking about
  jalapenos and serranos?  It makes a buncha difference. Salsa picante
  (which is what we mean when we talk about "salsa" down here) is made
  with one or both of the last two.  Acting on the presumption that
  it's salsa picante that you mean, here's a recipe.  One serrano
  equals two jalapenos. If you use jalapenos, removing the veins from
  the inside will make it less hot.
  
  Place all ingredients in a blender or food processor and blend until
  finely chopped.  Pour into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Lower heat
  and simmer 30 minutes. Cool slightly, pour into a pint jar, and
  refrigerate, or process in a boiling water bath 10 minutes (in which
  case reduce the cooking time the same amount). This sauce will keep
  three to four weeks in the refrigerator. Cooking Texas Style Candy

    3/4 c  Cider vinegar
 
  Stem the chiles, then roll them between your thumb and fingers,
  pressing gently to loosen the seeds inside. Break in half and shake
  out as many seeds as possible, then place in a blender jar. Heat an
  ungreased skillet over medium low.  Toast the sesames and
  pumpkinseeds separately. Pulverize the cumin alspice and cloves in a
  mortar, then add to the blender jar along with the oregano, salt
  garlic and vinegar. Blend for several minutes til the mixture is
  orange red and quite smooth. Stir in tequila and water to thin (about
  a 1/2 or 3/4 cup total). I generally let it sit for another hour and
  blend again, spoon into a jar and store in refrigerator. Makes 1 3/4

      Title: SALSA ROJA
 Categories: Mexican, Salsa, Sauces, Southwest
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        3    Pasilla, guajillo or ancho
  :          chiles -- Dried
        3    Serrano, chile arbol, Thai
  :          bird -- Dried
        3    Garlic,Clove,Raw -- With
  :          Skin
  
  Heat a large flat griddle or skillet over high heat. Place the chiles
  on the dry skillet, along with the garlic. Check them every few
  minutes, looking for brown spots as they toast on the dry griddle;
  turn both the chiles and the garlic cloves, keeping an eye on the
  color and more importantly on the aroma.  When the scent changes and
  takes on a toasty, rich character, they're done. Remove them from
  heat and let them cool for a few seconds.
  
  When cool enough to handle (the peppers cool more quickly than the
  garlic, which in turn takes longer to cook), pull out the stems,
  veins, seeds and placentas from the chiles. Tear the skins into
  medium-sized chunks and place them in a small bowl. Pour boiling
  water over them just to cover, then place a smaller bowl or saucer
  over the peppers to keep them immersed in the water. Set your timer
  for at least 30 minutes before continuing.
  
  After the peppers have had time to soak well, pour the peppers and
  water into a blender.  Peel the skins off the garlic cloves (which
  should smell sweet, smoky and wonderful in their own right) and drop
  them into the blender as well.  Puree thoroughly. The sauce will be
  chunky; if appearance is important, you can strain it through a wire
  strainer to get the larger pieces of the skin out of the mixture. (I
  begrudge the amount of sauce that clings to the mesh myself...)
  Taste it; add salt and serve immediately.

      Title: SALSA VERDE 3
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 3 Cups
 
  1 1/2 lb Fresh tomatillos
      2    Anaheim green chiles;
           -charred, peeled, & seeded
      3    Jalape#o chiles; partially
           -seeded & deveined
      2    Garlic clove
    1/2    Chicken bouillon cube; or
    1/2 c  Chicken broth
    1/4 c  Rice vinegar
      1 tb Light oil (sunflower)
    1/4 c  Cilantro; snipped
      1 pn Salt
 
  After removing the dry husks from the tomatillos, rinse them well
  under warm water to remove some of the stickiness. Cut tomatillos
  into quarters. Cut the Anaheim chiles and jalape#os into pieces.
  
  To the bowl of a food processor fitted with the knife blade
  attachment, add the tomatillos, chile pieces, and cloves of garlic.
  Chop to a coarse pur#e using on and off pulsations. If you want to
  use the salsa for dipping tostada chips or spooning onto homemade
  pizzas or tortas, it is best to make a coarse puree.  For a thinner
  suace consistency, pulse on your food processor for 20 seconds and
  pur#e the salsa. You can further thin down the sauce by adding 1 cup
  chicken broth, sour cream, or cream. Stir this liquid in during the
  simmering stage. This thinner sauce is perfect for enchiladas and
  tortas.
  
  After you have pur#ed the ingredients for your salsa, place mixture
  in a 3-quart saucepan.  Simmer everything except the fresh cilantro,
  for 12 to 15 minutes. Place the salsa into a bowl to cool completely
  before adding the cilantro.  Or store the salsa in a glass jar in the
  refrig- erator for up to 2 weeks and stir a few snipped springs of
  cilantro into the portion you will be serving.  Adjust seasonings,
  such as salt and more cilantro, by taste testing.
  
  This sauce is probably one of the most adaptable of all of the
  salsas: it can be used for dipping tostada chips, adding zest to
  quacamole, or saucing enchiladas, tortas, or homemade Mexican pizza.

    1 1/2 lb skinless, boneless baccala
        1    thick apple slice -- or 1/2
  :          potato
        3 TB extra-virgin olive oil
    1 1/2 TB freshly squeezed lemon
  :          juice
        1 sm clove garlic, -- finely
  :          chopped
  :          Freshly ground black pepper
        1 TB chopped fresh Italian
  :          parsley
  
  To prepare the salt cod, place it in a bowl and add cold water to
  cover and the apple or potato, which helps to draw out the salt.
  Refrigerate overnight, changing the water several times during the
  soaking. Drain the salt cod and rinse in fresh cool water. Place the
  cod in a pan with cold water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce
  the heat and cook gently until the fish is tender but not falling
  apart, 15 to 20 minutes. Taste it before draining to make sure it is
  cooked. If it is still too hard, continue cooking it gently. If you
  find it still too salty at this point, cover with fresh cold water,
  bring to a boil again, and drain and rinse. When the fish is tender,
  drain and rinse under cold water. Drain well and pat dry with a
  cotton kitchen towel. Check for any skin and bones that may have been
  missed.
  
  Break up the fish into large flakes and transfer to a serving plate.
  In a small bowl stir together the oil, lemon juice, garlic and pepper
  to taste. Drizzle over the fish. Sprinkle with the parsley. Serve at
  room temperature.

      Title: SALT CURED HAM
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 pt Salt
      1    Ham

MMMMM-----------------------CURING PROCESS----------------------------
 
  Okay, Gary,
     To salt down a ham you will again need a FRESH ham.
   If at all possible, find some Jefferson Island Salt.
   We have less trouble loosing hams when we use that.
   If not, use canning salt -- DO NOT USE IODIZED SALT.
     For each ham use two pints of salt.  Rub salt in well to all sides
  of ham, filling bone cavity.
        (cont) >>     I suppose that I should have told you prior to
  this that you have to have a salt box constructed of wood -- a very
  strong salt box.  It may have to withstand the assault of
  neighborhood dogs.
   Box should be large enough to hold hams in a single layer. (Ours is
  3'x5' on the bottom and about 2' high.) Size doesn't matter much as
  long as hams don't butt up against each other and it's not so small
  that the dogs can move it.      On to curing:  You will have salt
  left after rubbing on hams. Place a thin layer of the salt in the
  bottom of the box. Place ham on this, skin side down.  Pour the >>>
  remaining salt on the ham. Place top on box and secure. Find a handy
  calendar and mark down three weeks. Okay, ham comes up then. Wash
  salt off ham and LIBERALLY coat with black pepper. (Use dust mask
  from workshop if pepper bothers you.) Place in cloth sack (old pillow
  case will do nicely) and hang. Do not cut for at least 6 months, 1
  year is better.
    All of this should be done when the temp is 35 to 50 degrees.
    Good luck.  No guarantees.  (Sugar cure is better!)

      Title: SALT CURED LEG OF LAMB (SPEKEMAT)
 Categories: Lamb, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 lb Salt
      4 qt Water (less if the leg is
           -smaller)
      1 tb Sugar
      8 lb Leg of lamb
 
  You will need a large saucepan and a large crock. Dissolve the salt
  in the water to make a brine.  Add the sugar. Put the leg of lamb in
  a large crock and pour enough brine over it to cover it completely.
  Put a weight on top to keep it underwater. Leave to take the salt in
  a cool pantry (not below the freezing point, or the salting process
  comes to a halt) for 2 weeks for a leg weighing 8 lbs (roughly 2 days
  per pound of meat.)
  
  Take the leg out after the allotted time and rinse thoroughly so that
  you do not get too salty a rind. Hang it out to dry in a well-aired
  cool pantry, wrapped in a loose bag of cheesecloth or muslin to
  protect it from flies.  It will be dry, delicious, and ready to eat
  in 2 to 3 months.
  
  Serve, sliced very thin with a sharp knife, as part of an indoor
  picnic meal, with sweet butter, fresh hard-boiled eggs, a sliver of
  'geitost' (the Norwegian sweet brown cheese), and flat bread or
  potato pancakes to wrap around each morsel.  A bowl of sour cream and
  some fresh raspberries can follow as a replacement for Norwegian
  cloudberries.
  
  Yield:  3 to 5 lbs dried meat.  Allow 1/4 lb of dried meat per person.
  Time:   Start 3 months before you need it; 20 minutes

  ....................................................... ...........
  Jewish inns used to specialize in pickled vegetables and preserves.
  Many houswives in the SHTETL and ghettoes also made pickle and jams
  to supplement the family income. Being frugal, they did not throw
  away the pickling juice but used it to flavor and sour many dishes,
  especially soups.
  ....................................................... ...........
  
  SALT DILL PICKLES
  
  My mother, a superb pickler, maintains that the crunchiness and good
  green color of pickled cucumbers are achieved by first pouring
  boiling water over the cucumbers, blanching them for a few seconds
  and then refreshing them immediately with cold water.
  
  Wash and blanch the cucumbers. Refresh and arrange in a crock or a
  large glass jar in layers, interspacing them with dill, garlic and
  spices. Pour cold water, to cover, over the cucumbers in the crock.
  Pour out the water into a measuring jug. Salt with 1 tb (30g/1oz)
  salt for each 2 cups water (500ml/1pint). Dissolve the salt well in
  the measured water and pour over the cucumbers. Place vine leaves on
  top, then fit a heavy plate or wooden cover inside the crock and
  place a weight on to hold the cucumbers submerged. Leave in a
  warmplace to ferment. Skim as needed during the fermentation period.
  When bubbles disappear, the pickles are ready use; this can take up
  to 2 weeks or in a warm, sunny place it can take as little as 4-5
  days. When fermentation stops, keep the pickles in a dark, cool place
  or refrigerate.

  For the Yeast:
    Cool water sufficiently to bear your finger in it, then add salt,
  corn meal and lastly flour.  Beat until smooth,, then sprinkle flour
  over the top of the mixture. Cover and let stand for 5 hours in a
  warm place. By that time the clear water should have risen to top of
  the mixture. Drain off the water and beat the mixture thoroughly. Set
  aside for another hour, at the end of such time the mixture should be
  light and frothy. It is now ready to use. For the Bread:
    Sift flour in mixing bowl, add salt, and with your fingers mix in
  the lard.  Make a well in the center of the flour, pour in the yeast
  preparation and then the milk. Stir with spoon until stiff. Turn out
  on board and knead until smooth. Place in buttered baking pans and
  let rise until full. Bake 45 minutes.

      Title: SALT-AND-PEPPER SPICY SHRIMP
 Categories: Seafood, Oriental
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Salt
      1 lb Large shrimp
           - unpeeled and deveined
      2 ts Coarse or kosher salt
      1 ts Roasted Sichuan peppercorns
           -(ground)
      1 ts Sugar

  peppercorns, and sugar and set aside. In another small bowl, combine
  the garlic, ginger, scallions and the chopped chilies. Heat a wok or
  deep skillet until it is hot and add the oil. When the oil is very
  hot and smoking, add the shrimp and deep-fry for about 1 minute or
  until they are pink. Remove them immediately with a slotted spoon and
  drain well. Pour off all but 1 1/2 tablespoons of the oil and reheat
  the wok. Add the salt-peppercorns-sugar mixture and stir-fry for 10
  seconds. Add the garlic-ginger-scallion-chiles mixture and stir-fry
  for 10 seconds. Return the shrimp to the wok and stir-fry over high

      Title: SALT-ENCRUSTED RIBEYE ROAST
 Categories: Beef
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Box; (3-pound) coarse kosher
           -salt
  1 1/4 c  Water
      4    To 6lb well-trimmed beef
           -ribeye roast; small end
      1 tb Oil
      2 ts To 3 ts Cracked blk. pepper
 
  Preheat oven to 425 F. Line a shallow roasting pan with heavy-duty
  aluminum foil. Combine salt and water; mix well. (Mixture may appear
  dry but do not add more water.) In roasting pan, pat 1 1/2 cups salt
  mixture into rectangular shape, approximately 1/2 to 1 inch larger
  than the size of the roast. Brush the roast with oil; press pepper
  evenly into surface. Insert ovenproof meat thermometer into thickest
  part of roast, not resting in fat; center roast on salt layer.
  Starting at the base of the roast, pack remaining salt mixture onto
  sides and top of roast to encase roast in salt. (Some salt may fall
  off, exposing small areas of the roast; this will not affect
  cooking.) Do not add water or cover pan. Roast approximately 1 1/2 to
  1 3/4 hours for medium rare, 1 3/4 to 2 hours for medium doneness.
  Remove from oven when meat thermometer registers 130 F for
  medium-rare, 145 F for medium. Remove pan with roast to cooling rack;
  let stand 10 to 15 minutes. (Internal temperature will continue to
  rise.) Remove and discard salt crust from roast, brushing away all
  salt. Carve roast into 1/2-inch thick slices. Makes 6 to 8 servings.
  Note: Salt crust should be slightly thicker at the base of the roast
  than at the top. For easier packing of salt onto vertical surfaces,
  use one hand to hold the salt crust in place while using the other
  hand to pack on additional salt to cover. Salt crust should be
  applied to roast just before roasting. A small amount of liquid may
  collect in the bottom of the roasting pan during cooking.

      Title: SALT-ROASTED CHICKEN WITH MARINADE
 Categories: Chinese, Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Roasting chicken, 4 1/2 to
           -5 lbs.
      1 lg Piece caul fat or
           -cheesecloth soaked in oil
      5 lb To 6 lb coarse (kosher)
           -salt or rock salt

MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
      3 sl Fresh ginger root
      3    Whole garlic cloves,
           -lightly crushed
      3    Whole scallions, cut into
           -3-inch sections
      1 tb Peanut oil
      1 tb Bean sauce
      2 tb Thin soy sauce
      1 tb Shaoxing wine or dry sherry
      1 tb Sugar
      1    Whole star anise
      1 ts Whole Sichuan peppercorns,
           -roasted
    1/4 c  Chicken broth
      8    Whole stems Chinese parsley
 
  Method: Salt-roasting
  
  [This marinade can also be used on roasted duck. S.C.]
  
  Fill the chicken with the marinade, skewer it shut, and allow it to
  dry for 1 1/2 hours.
  
  1.  Wrap the chicken in a large piece of caul fat or cheesecloth
  soaked in oil.
  
  2.  Heat the salt in a pot [heavy Dutch oven, big wok or whatever can
  take the heat.  S.C.] on top of the stove over a low flame or in the
  oven at 350F for at least 1 hour. Pour off some of the salt, leaving
  just enough to cover the bottom of the pot.  Lay the chicken on top
  of the salt in the pot and cover it with the remaining salt. Cover
  the pot and bake the chicken for 1 1/2 hours.
  
  3.  Remove the chicken from the salt.
  
  4.  Pull off the salt that remains caked on the chicken. Be careful,
  because the salt is hot.
  
  5.  With a paper towel, wipe away the remaining salt. (The salt in
  the pot can be reused.)
  
  6.  Peel off the caul fat, drain the marinade, and cut the chicken
  into bite-size pieces.
  
  Serves 4 to 6 as a main course.
  
  May be served hot or cold; if cold, the chicken may be prepared up to
  a day in advance.  (Do not reheat.)
  
  Suggested beverage: Pinot Noir or Burgundy
  
  From "Chinese Technique" by Ken Hom with Harvey Steiman. Simon and
  Schuster, New York.  1981.
  
  This is a good "guest" food.  You can appear to have mastered esoteric
  Oriental cooking techniques without ever having actually prepared the
  dish before... Unless you drop the pot on the kitchen floor and set
  it on fire with the hot salt, it's a pretty foolproof cooking
  technique.
  
  I'd serve this two recipe with hot mustard, a bowl of hoisin sauce,
  Chinkiang vinegar, spiced salt and a bowl of chopped green onions for
  dipping along with some sweet Chinese pickles and lots of ice-cold
  Oriental beer.  Heaven!  (And rice, of course.)

           -green, cut in 1/4-inch
           -rounds
      1 ts Minced Chinese parsley
      1    Piece dried tangerine peel

  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Ground Szechuan or black
           -pepper
      2 ts Chinese orange wine or
           -Cointreau
      1 c  Warm water
      2 ts Cornstarch
      2 tb Cold chicken stock or cold
           -water
      5 lb Rock [or Kosher] salt
           Chinese parsley for
           -decorating
 
  I'm posting a couple of recipes for "Salt Baked" chicken. They're
  slightly different, but both good. The salt acts as the cooking
  medium and adds little, if any saltiness to the dish.
  
  Cooking time: 1 1/2 hours
  
  BEFORE COOKING:
  
  Wash bird and blot dry with paper towels.  Hang for 1 to 2 hours in a
  cool, dry place.  Combine the ginger root, scallion, parsley, dried
  tangerine peel, salt, pepper, orange wine and water in the bowl. Tie
  or sew the bird's neck opening.  Pour the marinade into the body
  cavity.
  
  Sew cavity shut to prevent marinade from leaking. Combine cornstarch
  and stock or water.  Have rock salt ready to go.
  
  COOKING:
  
  Put the rock salt in the casserole.  Turn heat to high and stir salt
  crystals until they become red-hot, about 30 minutes. Scoop out
  enough salt to make a well in which you can place the chicken,
  leaving a bed of salt about 2 inches thick.  Place the filled bird
  breast-side-down in the salt and pack it all around with the
  scooped-out salt. Cover casserole and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook
  for 45 to 60 minutes. Remover bird and cut away threads.  Pour
  marinade from the cavity into a strainer over the pint saucepan. Chop
  chicken into Chinese-style serving pieces and arrange on a platter.
  Heat the marinade over medium heat until boiling.
  
  Give the cornstarch-stock mixture a quick stir to dissolve any lumps;
  add to marinade.  Stir for 1 to 2 minutes or until the mixture
  becomes clear. Pour over bird. Decorate with sprigs of Chinese
  parsley and serve. The chicken will be tender and moist without being
  overly salty. It will have a subtle fragrance.
  
  Servings:  Enough for 4 as a single course or for 6 to 8 in a full
  menu.

      Title: SALTED EGGS
 Categories: Chinese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 12 Eggs
 
  1 1/2 c  Rock salt
      4 c  Fresh water
     12    Fresh eggs, preferably duck
           -eggs
 
  Bring water and rock salt to a boil; cool.  Place eggs in a crock or
  glass jar.  Pour salt-water mixture over eggs to cover. Cover crock
  and let stand in a cool place (not refrigerator) for three weeks.
  Remove eggs from salt bath and store them in the refrigerator if not
  ready to use immediately. Yolks should be a bright yellow-orange
  color and quite firm. The white should be slightly cloudy and still
  runny.  Eggs without a firm yolk should be discarded.  To hard cook,
  cover with fresh cold water and simmer for 20 minutes.  Shell an
  quarter.  Serve with hot rice or congee.
  
  NOTE:  Salted duck eggs may be purchased in mud-pack form or in brine
  in Oriental markets.  If in mud pack, scrape off mud, wash well and
  proceed with recipe.

      Title: SALTED HERBS
 Categories: Canadian
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
      1 c  Chopped fresh chives
      1 c  Chopped fresh savoury
      1 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      1 c  Chopped fresh chervil
      1 c  Grated carrots
      1 c  Chopped celery leaves
      1 c  Chopped green onions
    1/4    To 1/2 cup coarse salt
 
  These seasonings seem to be added to a lot of traditional French-
  Canadian recipes. "Herbs preserved with vegetables and salt make a
  lively seasoning for soups-particularly pea soup - sauces, stews and
  omelettes. A commercial brand, Les Herbes Salees du bas du fleuve, is
  marketed by J.Y. Roy of St. Flavie, Quebec. This recipe comes from
  the Metis district."
  
  In a large bowl, combine herbs and vegetables.  Layer 1 inch of herb
  mixture in the bottom of a crock or glass bowl and sprinkle with some
  of the salt.  Repeat layers until all of the herb mixture and salt is
  used. Cover and refrigerate for 2 weeks. Drain off accumulated liquid
  and pack herb mixture into sterilized jars. Refrigerate until ready
  to use. Makes about 5 to 6 cups.

      Title: SALTED YELLOW BEAN RELISH (SAMBAL TAUCO)
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
  6 1/2 oz Salted yellow beans
      5    Cloves garlic
      1 ts Ground ginger
    1/2 c  Tamarind water
      1 ts Brown sugar
      4    Green chillis or 1 tsp
           -chilli powder
      6    Shallots or i onion
    1/2 c  Water
      2 tb Vegetable oil
 
  'Tauco' is salted yellow beans; you can buy them in Britain at Chinese
  grocery shops, in cans. Sambal Tauco is another hot relish that keeps
  for a long time. You can make it less hot by using less chilli.
  
  Crush the garlic and the yellow beans together, either pounding them
  in a mortar or by means of a liquidizer. Seed the green chillis and
  slice them finely. Slice the shallots or onion. If you are using root
  ginger, peel and chop it into very small sticks. Heat the oil and
  saute the shallots for 1 minute. Add the chillis and ginger and saute
  for another minute; then put in the tauco and garlic paste, sugar,
  tamarind water and the water. Stir, then simmer for about 8 minutes.
  Stir again, still cooking, for 1 minute. Serve hot, or allow the
  sambal to cool before storing it in an airtight jar.

      Title: SALTED-COD PUDDING
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Cod, salted
    1/4 c  Rice
  1 1/4 c  Milk
      3 lg Eggs
           Butter
 
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Boil the salted cod until fully
  cooked. Take it out of the water and leave to cool. Skin the fish,
  de-bone it and make a stew out of it in a bowl, not adding anything.
  
  Boil the rice and mix it with the fish in the bowl to make a good
  mixture.
  
  Beat the eggs and mix it with the milk.
  
  Put the fish/rice mixture in a heat-resistant dish in which you have
  spread the butter.  Pour the milk/egg mixture over it and put it in
  the oven for 40 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich pudding with salt cod, eggs and milk -- This was cooked on
  a TV program a few days ago and is very nice.
  
  *  Icelandic saltfish is mostly exported to Spain, Portugal and Italy,
  where it is used in Christmas main dishes. Here in Iceland we just
  boil it, and usually eat it with boiled potatoes and boiled turnips,
  cut in pieces. As the fish is a bit dry we use butter with it, and
  sometimes brown bread.
  
  *  If you cannot get salt cod, you can make your own by salting a cod
  fillet and leaving it in the salt, refrigerated, for 3 or 4 days,
  then wash thoroughly.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 40 minutes baking.

     12 sl Of veal from the upper leg,
           -cut 1/2 inch thick
     12    Thin slices prosciutto (fat
           -and lean)
     24    Fresh sage leaves
           Flour
      6 tb Butter
  1 1/2 c  Dry white wine
           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper
 
  Put the veal slices between sheet of wax paper and pound them with
  the flat side of a meat cleaver to make them slightly thinner than
  they were cut. Season them with salt and pepper, place 2 sage leaves
  (dried sage is a poor substitute for this dish, but it may be used if
  necessary) and a slice of prosciutto on each slice, fold the slices
  in half, secure with toothpicks, and dust with flour.  Melt the
  butter in a large frying pan (or use 2 frying pans with slightly more
  butter so that all of the veal may be cooked at the same time) over
  fairly high heat, add the slices of veal, brown quickly for about 2
  minutes on each side, reduce the heat a, and continue cooking for
  about 5 minutes, or until the veal is just tender. Do not overcook.
  Transfer the veal to a hot serving platter, remove the toothpicks,
  and keep warm. De-glaze the pan with the wine, scraping the sides and
  bottom with a wooden spoon, reduce by 1/4 and pour over the veal.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

      4 tb Butter
      1 c  Marsala or dry white wine
    1/2 c  Hot beef bouillon
 
  Trim the veal scallops so that they are approximately all the same
  size. (Save trimmings for sauces.) Sprinkle a little salt and pepper
  on each slice of meat. Place 2 or more leaves of fresh or dried sage
  on each veal slice, or sprinkle about a scant 1/4 teaspoon ground
  sage on each. Cut prosciutto to the same size as veal slices. Top
  each veal slice with a prosciutto slice.  Roll up and secure with
  toothpicks or tie with kitchen thread.  Coat each veal roll lightly
  with flour, shaking off excess flour. Divide butter between 2 large
  frying pans; heat it without browning. Over medium heat, cook veal
  rolls about 5 minutes, or until golden brown on all sides.  Reduce
  heat and add 1/2 cup marsala and 1/4 cup beef bouillon to each frying
  pan.  Cover frying pans and cook for 5 to 10 minutes longer; cooking
  time depends on the size and thickness of the rolls. Shake the pans
  frequently to prevent sticking.  If necessary, add a little more beef
  bouillon; there should be 1 to 2 tablespoons sauce for each veal
  bird. Transfer the cooked veal birds to a heated serving dish and
  spoon the sauce over them.  Serve  immediately and very hot with a
  tossed green salad. 6 servings.

  roll out. Form the dough into a ball; knead it for 10 min on a
  floured surface until it is smooth and satiny. Divide the dough into
  2 equal balls, wrap each in wax paper and let them rest at room
  temperature for 20 - 30 min.
  
  On a floured surface, roll the first dough ball out as thinly as you
  possibly can.  Cut the dough into 2" squares using a pizza cutter, a
  ravioli wheel, or a very sharp, greased knife; save the scraps. Place
  the dough squares just slightly apart from each other on ungreased
  cookie sheet.  Sprinkle the squares with salt to taste and pat them
  to embed the salt.  Prick each square several times with a fork. Bake
  in a preheated 375 F oven for 15 to 20 min until just slightly
  browned. Repeat for remaining dough ball and scraps.
  
  SEA TOAST
  
  After the dough has rested, pinch off pieces about 1 1/2 to 2" round.
  On a floured surface, roll each piece into the thinnest free-form
  circle possible.  Place the circles on an ungreased cookie sheet;
  prick with a fork and bake at 375 F for about 15 min.  Very crispy
  and perfect for cheese or soups.  Makes about 2 dozen.
  
  OYSTER CRACKERS
  
  One rested dough ball at a time, roll the dough out as thinly as
  possible; transfer to a cookie sheet.  Cut the dough into diamond
  shaped, 1" crackers with a ravioli wheel or a pizza cutter; there is
  no need to separate the crackers as the dough's elasticity will do
  the job. Salt, embedded and gently prick the diamonds as previously
  described. Bake as directed for about 10 min.

      Title: SALTS USED IN PICKLING
 Categories: Preserves, Pickles, Canning
      Yield: 1 Text
 
 
  Use of canning or pickling salt is recommended. Fermented and
  non-fermented pickles may be safely made using either iodized or
  non-iodized table salt. However, non-caking materials added to table
  salts may make the brine cloudy. Flake salt varies in density and is
  not recommended for use.
  
  Reduced-sodium salts, for example, "Lite Salt" may be used in quick
  pickle recipes, as indicated in this guide. The pickles may, however,
  have a slightly different taste than expected. Caution: Use of
  reduced-sodium salt in fermented pickle recipes is not recommended.

MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
           Salt & White pepper
           Grated nutmeg
 
  To make the sauce, in a heavy saucepan melt the butter and heat
  WITHOUT browning.  Using a wire whisk, stir in the flour. Cook for 1
  to 2 minutes over low heat, then remove from the burner and gradually
  stir in the warm milk.  Move the pan back to the heat and bring to a
  boil, stirring steadily for a smooth sauce.  Add a pinch of salt and
  white pepper, and grate a little nutmeg for a nice flavor.
      As a general rule, thin white sauce is used for soups and sauces,
  medium for pastitsio and moussaka and other au gratin dishes, and a
  thick sauce for croquettes and souffles. From "The Food of Greece" by
  Vilma Liacouras Chantiles.

      Title: SALUF BI HILBEH (FLAT BREAD WITH FENUGREEK &
 Categories: Breads, Yemani
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1 pk Active dry yeast
  1 1/2 c  -Warm water
      2 c  Plain flour
      2 c  Wholemeal flour
    1/2 ts Salt
           Oil or ghee
           Hilbeh
 
  Makes 12 loaves Oven temperature: 260øC (500øF) Cooking time: 4
  minutes each lot
  
  Soak yeast in 1/4 cup water and stir to dissolve.
  
  Sift flours into a mixing bowl, remove 1 cup flour and keep aside.
  
  Blend remaining water and salt into yeast liquid and pour into flour.
  Mix in a little of the flour to thicken liquid, cover and leave in a
  warm place for 10-15 minutes until frothy. Blend in remaining flour
  in bowl, then beat by hand for 10 minutes, or on electric mixer using
  dough hook for 5 minutes.
  
  Turn onto a floured board and knead in enough of the reserved flour
  to make dough smooth and satiny. Return to bowl, sprinkle top of
  dough lightly with flour and stretch a sheet of plastic film over top
  of bowl. Leave in a warm place until doubled in bulk - about 30
  minutes. Preheat oven.
  
  Punch down dough and turn out on board.  Knead a little, then divide
  into 12 equal portions.  Place a heavy flat griddle or baking sheet
  on centre shelf in oven and heat for 10 minutes. Grease with a wad of
  paper towelling dipped in oil.  Roll out each portion to a 15 cm (6
  inch) round and prick with a fork. Brush top lightly with oil and
  spread on 1 teaspoon hilbeh. Lift 2 loaves onto a lightly floured,
  flat-edged baking sheet or plywood board and slide onto heated
  griddle or baking sheet.
  
  Bake in hot oven for 4 minutes.  Top may be lightly browned under a
  hot grill.  As breads are removed, wrap in a cloth to keep them warm
  and soft. Serve warm.
  
  NOTE: If breads begin to puff up during cooking, press top with a
  folded cloth.  Breads should be bubbly, but should not form a pocket.

 Categories: Breakfast, Breads, Desserts
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
      2 tb Vegetable shortening
      1 c  Sugar
      2    Beaten eggs
  4 3/4 c  Flour
      2 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Milk
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
    1/2 ts Vanilla powder or
           -vanilla extract.
 
  Cream shortening and sugar until fluffy.  Add eggs and vanilla if
  using extract and beat well. Combine dry ingredients (including
  vanilla if using powder) then sift together. Add dry mixture to
  creamed mixture, alternating with milk. Roll dough 1/2 inch thick on
  floured board. Cut into rounds, and cut out centers. A glass works
  well for cutting, with a small, empty prescription pill bottle to cut
  the centers. The centers can be rolled together for more doughnuts or
  fried as they are for 'donut holes.' Deep fry in vegetable oil,
  turning once, until browned. Drain on grocery bag (to absorb oil) and
  dust with confectioner's sugar. Yield: depends on how thin you roll,
  and what you do with the centers.

  2.  Place four 9-inch oval au gratin dishes (or one large oval glass
  lasagna pan) on a baking sheet.  In each small dish place 1 teaspoon
  of butter and 1 teaspoon of jelly. (If you are using a lasagna pan,
  smear the bottom with the butter and then with the jelly.
  
  3.  Combine the egg whites, vanilla sugar, and lemon zest in a large
  metal bowl.  Beat with an electric mixer at high speed until stiff
  peaks form.
  
  4.  Beat the egg yolks with the granulated sugar. Gently fold the egg

  mounds of the mixture into each au gratin dish. Smooth the surface of
  each and bake for 8 minutes, until puffed and golden.
  
  5.  Serve immediately.  This is especially good with Vanilla Sauce,
  warm Chocolate Sauce, or cold Strawberry Sauce (recipes separately).
  
  Serves 4.

 Categories: Main dish, Meats
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
           Boneless Rump Roast
           Salt
           Fresh Rosemary Needles
           Garlic Salt
           Freshly Ground Black Pepper
           Beer; OR

           Lemon Juice
           Beef Stock; OR
           Red Wine
           Minced Shallots
 
  NOTE:  This recipe is adjustable to all sizes of roasts. This is the
  Marinate the meat for a couple of hours in a liquid that is slightly
  acidic--a liquid such as wine, beer, vinegar, or lemon juice. Roast
  for 15 minutes per pound at 325 degrees F.  For the last 15 minutes,
  cook at 500 degrees F.  For example, for a 4 pound roast, total
  cooking time is 1 hour but it will be 45 minutes at 325 degrees F.
  and 15 minutes at 500 degrees F.  This will crust the outside of the
  roast and the inside will be medium, barely pink.
   This is based on room temperature meat.  If the meat is quite cold,
  extend the baking time.  After 3/4 of the cooking time, sprinkle with
  salt and some fresh or dry rosemary needles. Turn the roast with
  WOODEN SPOONS (Very important that you do not pierce the meat) and
  season it all over. Rosemary, seasoned salt or garlic salt are nice,
  and some freshly ground black pepper adds to the flavor also. Swab
  the roast with some fresh lemon juice--this will also add to the zing
  of the meat. When cooked, snip off the cords and slice to serve. From
  the roasting pan, spoon off the fat from the accumulated juice.  Add
  some beef stock or red wine to the juices, a few minced shallots or
  green onion shreds and cook down at high heat to a reduction or
  concentrated sauce. Adjust the seasonings, salt, pepper, and herbs of
  your choice, and serve with the roast.

      Title: SAMAR CODI (PRAWN CURRY)
 Categories: Main dish f, Indian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ts Cayenne pepper
      1 tb Bright red paprika
    1/2 ts Ground turmeric
      4    Garlic cloves peeled and
           Crushed
      1    In piece of fresh ginger
           Peeled and grated
      2 tb Coriander seeds
      1 ts Cumin seeds
     14 oz Can coconut milk well
           Stirred
    3/4 ts Salt
      3    Pieces of kokum or 1 tbsp
           Tamarind paste
      1 lb Peeled and de-veined
           Uncooked prawns
 
  In a bowl, combine 10 fl oz water with the cayenne pepper, paprika,
  turmeric, garlic and ginger. Mix well. Grind the coriander seeds and
  cumin seeds in a clean coffee grinder and add to the mixture.
  
  Put the spice mixture into a pan and bring to a simmer. Turn the heat
  to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes. The sauce should reduce and
  thicken. Add the coconut milk, salt, kokum or tamarind paste and
  bring to a simmer.
  
  Add the prawns and simmer, stirring now and then, until they turn
  opaque and are just cooked through.
  
  TIPS
  
  If you buy unpeeled headless prawns you will need 1
      1/2    lb.
  
  Kokum is the semi-dried sour skin of a fruit that grows along India's
  coast. Tamarind paste makes a good substitute.
  
  Madhur Jaffrey's Flavours of India - Goa
  
  When I arrive in Goa, the first dish I order is this simple prawn
  curry. It uses no oil, as nothing in it requires frying or sauteing.
  In many ways, it is the humblest of curries and may also be made with
  very cheap fish cut into chunks, fish steaks or fillet pieces. I like
  it made with juicy prawns, fresh from the sea. With a spicy red
  coconutty sauce flowing over a bed of white pearly rice - what else
  can one want? I rarely order this dish in the hotel that I stay in. I
  find a small beach shack covered with palm thatching, generally owned
  by real fishermen, and order it there. All I need with it is a cold
  glass of beer.

      Title: SAMBAL BAJAK
 Categories: Condiments, Indonesian
      Yield: 1 Cup
 
    1/2 lb Red hot chilies (fresh),
           -chopped coarsely
      1 lg Onion
      6    Garlic cloves
      8    Kemiri nuts,

      3 tb Peanut oil
    1/2 ts Laos powder
      1 tb Trasi (dried
           -shrimp paste)
      1 ts Salt
      5 tb Tamarind liquid
      2 tb Sugar
 
  Chop the chilies, onion and garlic in a food processor. In a small
  frying pan, saute this mixture in oil until well-cooked. Do not
  brown. Add the kemiri nuts, laos, trasi and salt.  Stir and mash
  until it is well blended. Add the tamarind liquid and sugar; simmer
  until the oil separates out. Cool and serve cold.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Fried chili-pepper sambal relish -- Indonesia is not known to have
  nuclear weapon capability, but visitors to Djakarta often suspect
  that if enough Sambal Bajak is put into an artillery shell it will
  have the same general effect. Indonesian hosts normally warn
  Westerners that this is "an acquired taste."
  
  *  Laos is a form of ginger.  Other names for it are galangal, Java
  root, galingale, or lengkuas.  If you can't find it, use about 1 t of
  powdered ginger mixed with about 1/4 t of powdered cinnamon. Trasi is
  shrimp paste; it can be left out. Tamarind liquid is made by soaking
  dried tamarind pulp in hot water for 1 hour and then straining. To
  make about 5 T of tamarind liquid, use about 1/4 cup of pulp and
  about 1/2 cup of hot water.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy if you have the ingredients.
  : Time:  30 minutes.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

  (Thai Dragon is a small very hot chile pepper from Thailand.)  Remove
  stems from the peppers and peel the garlic cloves. Put all
  ingredients in a food processor (using the steel blade) and mix 3 - 4
  minutes. Boil 10 minutes and put in sterilised jars.  This makes a
  sambal that is much hotter than the usual Sambal Olek you can find in
  Asian stores.  Use it when making hot Oriental food.
  
  Wash your hands with 80% alcohol after you handled the peppers! Don't
  touch your eyes or your private parts before you have washed your
  hands with alcohol! It will burn for hours.

  *  Indonesian relish with lime, chili and basil -- This recipe comes
  from the "Time/Life Pacific and Southeast Asian Cooking." I've been
  unable to find a recipe even remotely resembling it in any other
  Indonesian cookbook. I like to cross-reference recipes and learn
  where they came from, but only the Time/Life reporters seem to have
  found this one. In any event, it's quite wonderful. Not for the faint
  of heart.

  Stir-fry onions in hot oil until golden. Add chilli and salt, stir
  and reduce heat. Let simmer for 2 minutes. Add diced tomatoes,
  chopped anchovies, oil and all. Stir and let simmer very gently for
  15 minutes. Stir occasionally. This long cooking removes the bite of
  the chilli and blends all the flavours together. The same recipe can
  be prepared using red chilli instead of green chilli and ripe
  tomatoes instead of green ones. This sambal will keep for a week if
  put in the refrigerator.

  In Indonesian "kecap" is pronounced "ketchup".  Some folks say this
  is the origin of our word for the red stuff.
  
  The "cabi rawit" referred to below are the tiny bird peppers. You
  could substitute any hot chili.
  
  This is a very simple sambal, quick and easy to make. It is ideal for
  adding just a little piquancy to such dishes as Mie Jawa, any sate
  (especially if you don't like peanut butter sauce), and Nasi Goreng.
  
  Mix all the ingredients well together just before serving.

  potato and tomato (green beans and carrots may also be added).
  
  Add the turmeric powder to the soaking dhal and place on stove. Bring
  to boil, lower heat to keep the dhal simmering. Close pot and allow
  dhal to cook till tender. Soaking dhal before cooking consideraby
  lowers the cooking time which is about 30-45 minutes. Stir a few time
  to keep dhal from sticking at the bottom.
  
  While dhal is cooking lightly fry the onions or shallots in 2.5 tab.
  vegetable oil. Do not allow the onion/shallots to brown. When dhal has
  cooked add some more water to bring the water level up to 4-5 cups
  again (use your judgement here because I cannot be more precise!).
  Now add the potatoes, tomato, sauted onions/shallots, and any other
  vegetables to want to put in. Next add the tamarind paste (or
  tamarind "juice"), and sambar powder. Stir and bring to a simmer.
  Cover and allow the cook until vegetables are tender (about 15
  minutes) and keep stirring occassionally.
  
  Heat the remaining 1/2 tab. oil and add the mustard, cumin, coriander
  seeds and the crushed red chillie to the hot oil. As soon as the
  mustard seeds begin to pop stir the whole thing once and add to the
  cooking sambar. Finally add the cilantro leaves and cook for another
  5 minutes and remove from stove.
  
  The consistency should be like a thin soup and the sambar powder
  should not appear like dirt sticking to the veggies (you will see
  this happen initially). You may also add some green chillies if you
  like to add more "zip" to the sambar. If so add it with the rest of
  the veggies.
  
  Sambar can be eaten with plain cooked rice, idlies (I know I owe you
  all this recipe!) or dhosas. Sambar is an integral part of South
  Indian cooking. It is made every day. As I mentioned in San Antonio a
  visiting naturalist from the Smithsonian Institute described a South
  Indian meal thus: mountain of rice and river of sambar!

      1    Egg; beaten
           Sugar
 
  "This is a sweet version of the meaty triangles popular in the Gulf
  States during the holy month of Ramadan."
  
  1. Combine the filling ingredients (saffron, rosewater, almonds, 1/3 c
  sugar, and cardamom).
  
  2. Preheat the oven to 375'F. Grease 1 or 2 baking sheets.
  
  3. Cut the defrosted filo strips 2 1/2 to 3 inches wide, stacking and
  covering with a slightly dampened towel to prevent drying. Lay 3 to 4
  strips on your work surface and brush lightly with melted butter.
  Layer a second strip on top of each.
  
  4. Place a tablespoon of the filling toward the bottom right-hand
  corner of each strip. Fold that corner diagonally over to the top
  left-hand corner, forming a triangle. As you fold, be certain that
  the side of the strip lines up perfectly with the folded portion.
  Then fold straight up. Continue as if folding a flag, alternately
  folding the bottom corners in a diagonal pattern and up. Place on the
  baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.
  
  5. Brush the tops of the pastries lightly with a bit of egg and
  sprinkle with sugar. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until golden brown.
  
  Tunisia variation: Substitute grated orange peel for the saffron and
  cardamom, and drizzle with sweet syrup after baking.
  
  Lebanon variation: Substitute walnuts for the almonds, cinnamon and
  nutmeg for the saffron and cardamom.

           -2 inches long
      1    Scallion; sliced thin

      1 sm Chicken OR cornish game hen
           -(about 1 pound)
      2 c  Water
      1 ts Sesame seeds, toasted
      1 ts Korean sesame oil
    1/8 ts Pepper
 
  "This Samgyetang is a celebrated soup from the island of Cheju, and
  deservedly so since the prestigious, almost mystical, ginseng root is
  cooked and eaten like a vegetable with the chicken. The Samgyetang is
  cooked in a tukbaege and brought still bubbling to the table. It is
  considered to be a summer dish in restaurants and homes. Koreans will
  break up the chicken and rice in the pot so that it becomes a gruel.
  I prefer that each person helps himself out of the pot, taking
  something of all the ingredients and spooning the rich, thick broth
  over all. It seems to me more aesthetic without altering the taste.
  The jujubes prove a touch of contrasting sweetness to the chicken,
  rice and ginseng. Ginseng, or "insam" as it is also called in Korea,
  tastes to me like a slightly bitter parsnip. Its properties are
  alleged to be strengthening and bring about rejuvenation."
  
  1. Mix the rice, ginseng root, scallion, 3 of the jujubes and 1 garlic
  clove together and stuff the chicken. Sew up the opening.
  
  2. Put the chicken in the "tukbaege" or in a heavy pot with a cover
  that is just a bit larger than the chicken. Add the 2 cups water, the
  other 3 jujubes, the other garlic clove, the sesame seeds and sesame
  oil and the pepper. Bring to a boil, cover the pot and reduce heat to
  low. Simmer over low heat for 1 hour.
  
  The soup will develop a thick, cloudy consistency and the chicken will
  soften enough to melt away from the bones.
  
  Serve hot in the "tukbaege" if you have one, or transfer the chicken
  and broth to a large serving bowl.

  Pastry:  Sift flour and salt into a bowl, add oil and warm water and
  mix thoroughly, until ingredients are combined. (Add a little more
  water if necessary to combine ingredients.) Knead for about 10
  minutes or until dough is elastic.  Cover with plastic wrap and set
  aside while preparing filling. Filling: Heat oil in a saucepan and
  fry garlic, ginger and half the onion until onion is soft.  Add curry
  powder, salt and vinegar, mix well.  Add minced steak and fry over a
  high heat, stirring constantly until meat changes color.  Turn heat
  down and add hot water. Cover pan and cook until meat is tender and
  all the liquid has been absorbed. Towards end of cooking, stir
  frequently to prevent meat from sticking to base of pan. Sprinkle
  with garam masala and chopped mint or coriander, remove from heat and
  allow to cool. Mix in reserved chopped onion. Take small pieces of
  dough, shape into balls and on a lightly floured board roll each one
  thinly to a circle, the size of a saucer. Cut each circle in half.
  fPut a teaspoon of filling on one side of each half circle and brush
  edges with water. Fold dough over and press edges together firmly.
  You will now have triangular shaped samoosas. When they are all made,
  heat oil in a deep pan and deep fry a few at a time until golden
  brown on both sides. Drain on absorbent paper and serve hot. NOTE:
  Both samoosa and singara can be made using spring roll wrappers. Cut
  into 2 1/2 inch strips the length of the pastry. Put a teaspoon of
  filling at one end and fold the pastry over diagonally, then fold
  again and again, still keeping a triangular shape. Moisten end of
  strip with water or beaten egg and press lightly.

 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 48 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------PUR (PASTRY-----------------------------
    750 ml Cake flour
      1 pn Borrie (turmeric)
  2 1/2 ml Salt
    250 ml Cold water
      5 ml White vinegar
     75 ml Cooking oil for spreading
 
  Preheat oven to 200 'C. Sift flour,borrie and salt into a mixing bowl.
  Combine water and vinegar and mix with flour to a fairly stiff
  mixture,The consistency of bread dough. Divide into 12 balls. Working
  with four balls of dough at a time, roll each into a round the size
  of a large saucer (15 cm in diameter). Using your fingers, spread a
  little oil on each round,covering it well so that it does not stick
  during cooking. Sprinkle lightly with flour and place one round on
  top of the other, oily sides together. You will now have two rounds,
  each made up of a double layer of dough. oil and flour the tops in
  the same way as before. Sandwich these together to form a single pile
  of four rounds. Each layer of which has been oiled and dusted with
  flour. Repeat with remaining balls of dough.
  
  Gently roll out piles of rounds on a lightly floured board to a 25 cm
  diameter circle or oval. Turn the pastry from time to time. Place the
  rolled out pastry on an ungreased baking sheet and bake for 2-3
  minutes or until the pastry has puffed up slightly. Remove from oven
  and cut into strips 6 cm wide and 25-30 cm long. Then separate into
  thin layers before the pastry cools down. Cover with a damp cloth to
  prevent the pastry from drying out.
  
  Now hopefully I don't confuse you on this next part! My diagram is
  supposed to represent the strip of pastry 6 cm wide 25-30 cm long.
  Fold #1 corner over # 2, Then fold the # 2 triangle over # 3 this
  will have created a pocket where the filling goes into.

  Fill the pocket with one of the samoosas filling recipes. You then
  continue folding the triangles to seal off the opening. Seal off the
  small remaining edge with a paste of flour and water, Then lightly
  pinch two bottom edges together to puff it up before you fry it.
  
  Once the filling and folding has taken place, You deep-fry the
  samoosas in hot oil over medium heat, turning once or twice to ensure
  that they are evenly cooked. When golden brown, remove with a slotted
  spoon and drain on paper towel.
  
  Makes 48 samoosas.

  Shape into a ball and sit in a loosely covered bowl while you prepare
  the filling.
  
  To Prepare Filling:  Cook potatoes and carrot in water until soft.
  Drain well, and set aside.  Melt 2 TBS butter in a skillet, and the
  onion, garlic, and ginger and saute until soft. Add salt, coriander,
  cumin, tumeric,and cayenne, and cook, stirring, until mixture forms a
  paste and continue cooking for 2 mins.  Add the drained vegs, and

  stir in thawed peas, add water and lemon juice, reduce heat to low,
  cover and cook another 5 mins. Remove filling from heat, and cool.
  
  To shape the samosas: Pinch off enough dough to make a ball 1 inch in
  diameter.  On lightly floured surface, roll into a 31/2-4" circle.
  Cut the circle in half, moisten one of the edges and fold in over on
  itself and press to seal, making a cone shape.  Fill the cone with
  vegetable mix. Press to seal.  OR...cut into squares, fill, and fold
  into triangles.
  
  Heat oil in deep fryer to 370 degrees and fry samosas, removing them
  as soon as they are brown and crispy. Drain on paper towelling, and
  keep warm in the oven until you have fried them all. *
  
  Filled samosas can be refrigerated in an air-tight container up to 3
  hours before frying, but not overnight.
  
  Serve as an appetizer, with mango chutney as a side.
  
  NB.*  I have used a Puff Pastry, or Phyllo dough, and baked them, and

      3    Whole dried red chilies
    1/2 ts Turmeric
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Lemon juice
 
  To make the pastry, combine the 2 c of flour with 3 tb oil. Add salt
  & mix. Add 1 cup of water a little at a time until you have a firm
  dough. Knead the dough well for 10 minutes or until the dough is
  elasticy & smooth. Form inot a ball, brush with a little oil, cover
  with a damp towel & set aside.
  
  To make the filling:
  
  Boil the potatoes & let them cool.  You may peel them if you like,I
  choose not to.  Dice them into bite-sized pieces.
  
  In a wok or very large skillet, heat oil over medium heat. When very
  hot, drop in the asafetida.  5 seconds later, add the fennel & cumin
  seeds. A few seconds later add in rapid succession the mustard seeds
  & fenugreek. As they begin to change colour & pop, add the chilies.
  As soon as the chilies swell & darken, add the potatoes, turmeric &
  salt. Fry gently, carefully turning the potatoes so as not to break
  them. Fry for 15 to 20 minutes until the potatoes are unevenly
  browned. Add lemon juice & mix well. Check the salt.  Remove potatoes
  from the wok, place in a serving dish & crush coarsely with the back
  of a slotted spoon.
  
  Divide the dough into 28 to 30 equal balls.  Flatten each ball & roll
  it out on a floured surface until it is approximately 4 inches in
  diameter. Cut each round in half.
  
  Taking one semicircle at a time, moisten half the length of the cut
  edge with a finger dipped in water. Form a wide cone with the
  semi-circle, using the moist section to overlap 1/4 inch & hold it
  closed. Fill samosa 3/4 full with stuffing.  Moisten the inside edges
  of the opening & press it shut.  Seal this end by pressing down on it
  with a fork as you would a pie crust.  Do all the samosas this way,
  keeping them moist in a plastic wrap or under a damp towel until you
  are ready to fry. (I find that I save a lot of time & anguish by
  frying them as I go).
  
  Heat the oil for deep frying in a wok.  When the oil is hot, slide in
  3 or 4 samosas, be careful not to overcrowd. Fry until the samosas
  are brown on all sides, about 2 or 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted
  spoon & drain on paper towels.  Repeat until you have 60 samosas. The
  oil should be hot, but do not use a high heat otherwise they will
  burn.
  
  Serve samosas hot with a sweet chutney or tamarind paste. They can be
  frozen & re-heated in a 300F oven.

      Title: SAMOSAS WITH SPICY PUMPKIN FILLING
 Categories: Bakery, Indian, Vegetarian, Karen's
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
MMMMM------------------------SAMOSA DOUGH-----------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Oil
      5 tb Cold water
           -- or as needed

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 tb Oil
    1/2 md Onion
      2 ea Garlic cloves
     16 oz Cooked pumpkin puree
           -- canned or homemade
      1 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 ts Salt, or to taste
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper, or to taste
    1/4 ts Ground cumin
    1/4 ts Ground coriander
    1/8 ts Turmeric
    1/8 ts Ground ginger
    1/8 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/8 ts Ground cardamom
    1/4 ts Sugar
           Oil, for frying
 
  In a food processor or by hand, combine flour and salt. Add oil,
  mixing until flour resembles fine crumbs. Add just enough cold water
  to form a medium-soft dough.  (If using a food processor, dough will
  form a ball and leave sides of work bowl.) Refrigerate dough,
  covered, while you prepare filling.
  
  In a skillet, saute onion and garlic in 1 tablespoon oil. When onion
  and garlic are soft and translucent, add pumpkin and seasonings. Cook
  over medium heat, stirring frequently, until mixture it thick, about
  10 minutes. Set aside to cool before filling samosas.
  
  Assembly:  Roll out small 1-inch balls of dough into very thin
  circles. Cut each circle in half.  Place a rounded teaspoonful of
  filling into the middle of one semi-circle, then roll dough up to
  encase filling, forming a cone-shape in which the circle's rounded
  edge becomes the wide end of the cone.  Pinch wide end of cone
  closed. Repeat for remaining dough and filling until all samosas are
  filled.
  
  Heat a couple of inches of oil over moderately-low heat. Fry samosas
  in hot oil until golden brown and crisp. Remove and drain on
  absorbent paper.

    3/4 c  Beer -- room temperature
    3/4 c  Unbleached flour
      2 c  Canola oil
     18    Fresh corn tortillas
           SALSA BLANCA:
    1/2 c  Mayonnaise
    1/2 c  Plain yogurt -- or sour
           Cream
    1/2 ts Salt
  1 3/4 c  Shredded cabbage -- Napa
           ROSARITO BEACH SALSA:
    1/2 c  Oil
     10    Chiles de arbol
      2    Tomatoes
    1/2 c  Tomato sauce -- canned
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  Cut fish into strips about 2 inches wide and 3 inches long. Roll in
  the 1/2 cup flour, dust off excess. Set aside while mixing batter.
  Beat together egg yolks, seasonings, beer and the 3/4 cup flour until
  well blended. Whisk egg whites until they resemble soft whipped
  cream, then fold gently into batter. Set aside. This batter holds up
  quite well for up to 1 hour. Heat oil in flat-bottomed wok or cast
  iron skillet. Dip floured fish pieces in the beer batter and
  carefully slip into hot oil. Fry unto fish turns a deep gold, turning
  so it browns evenly. Remove to crumpled paper towels to drain. Warm
  corn tortillas on a griddle placed next to wok or skillet. (Or in
  oven.) For the salsa blanca: Blend mayonnaise, yogurt and salt. Makes
  1 cup. For the Rosarito salsa: Heat oil in a small cast iron pan and
  fry the chilies in in it until they are a deep burnished red. This
  step gives the salsa an incomparable smoky flavor. Remove to paper
  towels and blot off oil. While the chilies are cooling, broil the
  tomatoes about 5 minutes, turning once. Remove cores and most of the
  skin. Stem chilies and break pods into pieces. Place tomatoes, tomato
  sauce, salt and chilies in the bowl of a food processor: process
  until chilies are broken up into small, dark flecks. Use for tacos
  and over eggs. Makes 1cup. Spread a scant tablespoon of Salsa Blanca
  over warm tortilla, add a heaping tablespoon of shredded cabbage and
  press into sauce. Add 2 or 3 chunks of fried fish and drizzle
  withRosarito Beach Salsa. Eat immediately. Makes 18 tacos.

  Warm a large bowl.  Pour 1 1/2 cups warm water into warmed bowl.
  Sprinkle yeast over water.  Set aside to soften 5 minutes. Stir in
  sourdough starter, sugar and salt. Beat in 3 cups flour until
  blended. Cover with a cloth and set in a warm place free from drafts.
  Let rise 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until doubled in size. Lightly grease a
  large baking sheet; set aside. Stir down dough. Stir in enough
  remaining flour to make a medium stiff dough.  Turn out onto a
  lightly floured surface. Knead dough 8 to 10 minutes or until smooth
  and elastic. Add more flour if necessary. Shape kneaded dough into
  two 10x3 1/2" loaves. Pull out ends of each to make them narrower
  than center of loaf. Or shape into 2 round loaves. Place on prepared
  baking sheet. Cover with a cloth and set in a warm place free from
  drafts.  Let rise 1 to 2 hours or until almost doubled in size.
  Preheat oven to 400F.  Pour water 1" deep into a 12x 71/2" baking
  pan. Place in bottom of preheating oven. Use a pastry brush to brush
  tops of loaves with water.  Use a very sharp knife to cut diagonal
  slashes across tops of loaves.  Bake in preheated oven 45 minutes or
  until crust is golden brown and loaves sound hollow when tapped with
  your fingers. After 30 minutes, if loaves are golden brown, cover
  with a tent of foil to prevent further browning. Remove from baking
  sheet. Cool on a rack. Makes 2 loaves.

   Place them in a small bowl and add water and wine
  
   3) Pour water from above mixture into the bowl of minced shrimp and
  add the pepper, the salt and the 1/2 an egg white. Stir well in one
  general direction until sticky and smooth. Add 1 tablespoon of
  cornstarch and stir again.
  
   4) Soak the mushrooms in a bowl of warm water for 10 minutes. Drain,
  remove the stems, and shred into thin slices. Boil the green
  vegetables in boiling water for 3 seconds. Plunge in cold water and
  squeeze dry.

  (mixed with 1 tablespoon of water).
   Make into a thin pancake (about 10 inches).  Remove cooked pancake

   6) Sprinkle some cornstarch on the pancake.  Spread 1/2 of shrimp
  mixture evenly over pancake and sprinkle some more cornstarch on it.

  Finally, put the shredded mushroom shreds into 2 rows along the two
  ends. From these two ends, slowly roll pancake toward the center and
  paste together with some shrimp paste. Place upon oblong dish and
  steam for about 8 minutes.
  
   7) Remove and cut into slices.  Arrange on plate attractively. (You
  may make a flour-batter: mix with some eggs flour, cornstarch and
  cold water. Dip the whole shrimp roll into the mixture and deep fry
  until golden brown, then cut into slices).
  
   NOTE: Laver and ham shreds may be used in place of the vegetable
  leaves and black mushrooms.

   Children will love these-they are fun to make and to eat. Adults
  will also find them irresistible.
  
   Preheat oven to 375ø.
  
   In large bowl, with mixer at low speed, beat egg yolks and milk
  until well blended. Add flour, sugar, butter, vanilla and salt; beat
  ingredients until just mixed. Increase speed to medium and beat 2
  minutes, occasionally scraping bowl. Divide dough in half.
  
   On floured pastry cloth, with lightly floured stockinette- covered
  rolling pin, roll one dough half 1/8-inch thick. With 2 1/4-inch
  fluted-edged cookie cutter, cut dough into rounds; with 1/2-inch
  round cutter, cut out centers from half of rounds. Reserve the dough
  scraps.
  
   Using a pancake turner, place rounds 1/2-inch apart on un- greased
  cookie sheets; bake at 375ø 8-10 minutes until lightly browned. With
  pancake turner, remove cookies to wire racks to cool completely.
  
   Repeat cutting and baking with second half of dough, rerolling
  scraps.
  
   Prepare frosting: In the bowl of an electric mixer, place all
  frosting ingredients (except food color) and beat at low speed for 2
  minutes. Scrape sides of bowl and continue beating at high speed for
  6 minutes. Divide frosting into thirds and tint with food color.
  
   On bottom side of cookie without a hole, spread teaspoonful of either
  green, pink or yellow frosting; top with a cookie with a hole in it
  to make a "sandwich." Repeat with remaining cookies and frosting.
  (Use any leftover frosting for graham crackers or cupcakes.)

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    Parts low-fat plain yogurt
           -with one part mayonnaise.
 
  Peanut Butter and _____ Sandwiches
  
  Peanut butter combines well with: honey sliced bananas grated carrots
  raisins applesauce bacon bits cream cheese jam/jelly toasted wheat

  Tuna Fish and Mayonnaise combine with: pickle relish sliced cucumbers
  sunflower seeds
                 sprouts sliced avocado grated carrot chopped celery
  sliced egg
  
  Note: Mayonnaise in a sandwich does not hold up well without
  refrigeration, and could cause poisoning. It turns rancid upon
  prolonged exposure to heat. Avoid using it for summer camp lunches,
  or if your child's lunch will be sitting on a radiator in school all
  morning. Mayonnaise usually does not freeze well. If the amount you
  are using in your sandwich is small, however, you should have no
  trouble keeping sandwiches mixed with mayonnaise in the freezer. This
  also holds true for egg salad that is well mashed.
  
  Hint: Reduce the fat content of added mayonnaise by combining
  
  Cream Cheese Combines well with: bacon bits crushed pineapple chpped
  nuts luncheon meats peanut butter sliced egg sliced cucumber
  marmalade or jam raisins, whole or ground
  
  Hint: one enrichment technique is to mix a tablespoon of powdered

      Title: SANDWICH SAFETY
 Categories: Info, Sandwiches
      Yield: 1 Tip
 
           -Robbie Shelton
 
  Few lunch boxes, school lockers, or backpacks are refrigerated, so
  it's important for the sandwich make to know a bit about food safety
  and food spoilage. The two most important principles are keeping
  temperatures cool and avoiding cross-contamination.
  
  To minimize the growth of bacteria and other organisms that can cause
  food spoilage or food-borne illness, remember the basic formula
  4-40-140: Perishable foods should spend no more than 4 hours at
  temperature between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit.  (Higher
  temperatures kill spoilage organisms, and lower temperatures keep
  them from growing.) By the end of four hours, bacteria may have
  multiplied to unsafe levels. the effect is cumulative, so food that
  has sat out at room temperature for two hours and then been returned
  to the refrigerator has only another two hours of room temperature
  shelf life left unless it has been cooked again.
  
  What are perishable foods?  Basically, those which are high in
  protein and moisture but low in acid, salt, or sugar (all of these
  are preservatives). Highly salted or dry-cured meats, such as
  prosciutto or dry salami, and most cheeses can stand room temperature
  much better than, say, home-cooked turkey breast or egg salad,
  Incidentally, mayonnaise has gotten a bad rap in terms of spoilage.
  Many cooks have an extreme fear of putting mayonnaise into sandwiches
  that will be out of refrigeration for more than a matter of minutes,
  fearing that it will spoil quickly. In fact, commercial mayonnaise
  contains enough vinegar to prevent spoilage for hours.  (This is not
  necessarily true of homemade mayonnaise.) The meat will probably
  spoil sooner than the mayonnaise. In any case, observe the four hour
  rule and you should be safe.
  
  In practical terms, a sandwich made in the morning from properly
  stored ingredients and taken to school or work should be fine at noon
  ~ but it is suspect by midafternoon.
  
  The other principle to remember in sandwich making (as in all
  cooking) is to avoid cross-contamination, that is, reinfecting cooked
  foods with bacteria from raw foods (mostly meats). Prevention is
  simple. Tools, hands, and surfaces used for handling raw meats need
  to be thoroughly washed before being used for any food that will not
  be cooked. Most delicatessens do not sell raw meats, but if they do,
  they should have separate handling areas (including slicers, if
  appropriate) for raw and cooked items.
  
  This information is from THE ART OF THE SANDWICH by Jay Harlow.

           ..........................
 
  Though it's been around a long time, there's something almost
  quintessentially American about the sandwich. It's casual,
  convenient, and incredibly adaptable, equally at home in the
  lunchbox, the all night diner, and the hors d'oeuvres tray.
    Chances are we'd be enjoying sandwiches today even if the gambling
  table hadn't been invented, but they wouldn't be called sandwiches.
  After all it was the gambling table that prompted the fourth Earl of
  Sandwich ( 1718-1792 ) to have his food served to him between two
  slices of bread so he wouldn't have to interrupt his gaming to eat.
    Actually though people were  munching on various foods stuffed
  between slabs of bread long before the earl came into the picture.
    I've tried to get a good range of different types of sandwiches,
  different fillings, salads and garnishes, as well as I hope, some
  useful information.
   So please sit back and enjoy, and I'll start posting some of what I
  have found in the way of " Sandwich Stuff."

      Title: SANDY WILLIAMS'S TORTAS DE PAPA  (POTATO CAKE
 Categories: Potato
      Yield: 32 Servings
 
      8 md Baking potatoes
           Salt
    1/2 c  Feta cheese, crumbled
      2    Eggs
      3 tb Vegetable oil
           Salsa
 
  Boil the potatoes for 15 minutes or until well cooked; drain, when
  cool enough to handle, but not cold, peel them. In a large bowl, mash
  them, add salt to taste and mix thoroughly. Set aside. Using a
  blender, coarsely chop the cheese. Combine the potatoes and cheese,
  mixing well, using your fingers.  Add eggs and continue mixing by
  hand until the mixture is smooth. Taste and add salt if necessary.
  Heat some of the oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Scoop out a
  little bit of the potato mixture (aobut 2 tablespoons) and pat out a
  small cake with your fingers, flipping it gently from hand to hand
  until it is a uniform shape, about 3 inches in diameter and about 1/2
  inch thick. Place the potato cake in the hot oil and saute for about
  3-4 minutes. Remove from the pan and drain it on a paper towel. After
  patting out each cake, dip your fingers in a bowl of water so the
  next one will not stick and add some oil to the frying pan after each
  batch. Stack the drained potato cakes on a platter in a warm oven
  until ready to serve. (To store, wrap them in foil and refrigerate.
  Reheat by placing the foil package in a moderate over for 15 - 20
  minutes. They are not crisp on the outside when reheated, but still
  tasty)
  
  Serve with salsa.

      2    Stalks celery, chopped
      4    Cloves garlic, minced
      1    Bell pepper, chopped
      1    Jalapeno pepper, minced
      2 lb Tofu chunks
      2 tb Each ground red chilis,
           -cumin, oregano
      1    Bay leaf
      2 c  Water
      2    28 oz. cans tomatos
      6 oz Can tomato paste
      2 cn Kidney beans
           -salt to taste
 
  Saute first five ingredients in oil until limp.  Add tofu and saute
  until browned.  Mix the spices together in a bowl and sprinkle into
  the pot. Mix thoroughly. Add water, tomatoes and tomato paste. Stir.
  Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours, stirring
  occasionally. If desired, at this point, add the kidney beans. Taste
  and correct seasoning. The addition of 1 tsp to 1 tblsp of cayenne
  pepper can make this gradually more spicy. As the recipe reads, itUs
  fairly tame. NOTE: The ground chilis are NOT chili powder.  Most
  chili powder is made up of a combination of chilis, oregano, cumin,
  salt and garlic. If chili powder is all you can find, then you will
  have to readjust the cumin and oregano amounts.

  1 1/2 oz Tequila
  1 1/2 oz 80 proof vodka
      6 oz V8 Picante vegetable juice
      6    Shakes Tabasco jalapeno
           Hot sauce
      6    Shakes Tabasco habanero

      1 tb Fresh lime juice
      1 pn Ground cumin
      1 pn Fresh ground black pepper
           Garnish with cilantro sprig
 
  I don't usually call for specific brand names in my recipes but I'm
  making an exception in this case. The V8 Picante vegetable juice
  cocktail is better than any generic vegetable juice for this drink.
  
  Just mix up the ingredients and pour them over ice. This is just a
  variation on the good old bloody mary.

  Prepare the sauce first: Combine the water and stock in a saucepan.
  Bring to a boil. Combine the chile powder, bacon fat and several
  tablespoons of the hot stock from the other saucepan in a saucepan.
  Cook, stirring steadily, over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes to
  remove the raw taste from the chile powder. Stir in the tomato paste,
  oregano, salt and garlic. Slowly stir in the remainder of the hot
  stock from the other saucepan. Simmer over low heat for 20 minutes.

  ricotta in a bowl. Add the first measure of shredded Longhorn Cheddar.
  Combine using a fork.
  
  Heat some corn oil to 300 degrees in a deep skillet. Soften the
  tortillas by passing them through the hot oil and pressing them
  between towels to remove the excess oil.
  
  Fill each tortilla with about 2/3 cup of the cheese and onion
  mixture. Roll them up and place them, seam side down, in a lightly
  buttered baking dish. Spoon on enough sauce to cover the tortillas.
  Cover. Bake about 15 minutes. Uncover. Sprinkle the second measure of
  shredded Longhorn Cheddar over. Return to the oven until the cheese
  is melted (about 5 minutes). Cover with additional hot sauce. Serve
  the tortillas in pairs. Place 1 fried egg on each pair of tortillas.
  Garnish with shredded lettuce and sour cream.

  Cafe Pasquales - "good for b,l,d - wide range of choices" 4. The
  Natural Cafe (mentioned twice) - "don't emphasize FF but very
  accomodating" 5. The Coyote Cantina - "cheaper than the restaurant,
  the food is good" 6. The Shed 7. The Santa Cafe 8. The Galisteo News
  ~ "great coffee and atmosphere" 9.  Cafe Escalera - "run by Deborah
  Madison who wrote the Greens cookbooks"
  
  With the exception of the Natural Cafe, vlf is dificult in Santa Fe,
  but lf is not too bad.  I was also amazed at the creativity of the
  local chefs - very unusual, but delicious, combinations.  Escalera
  was a disappointment: the stuffed polenta was stuffed with three
  cheeses. Two other restaurants not included in the original posts,
  but which were excellent:
  
  ALSO: Pauls - a local concierge described it as "one of Santa Fe's
  best kept secrets" - until it appears in Conde-Nast, which it
  probably will soon; and,
  
  Inn of the Anasazi
  
  Thanks again for everyone's help.

  I would add one restaurant to David's list. Unfortunately, in
  replying to his original posting I couldn't remember its name, but my
  wife did later. It's name is "Healthy David's," and it's located just
  a few blocks from the Plaza in a building with a number of boutiques.
  They have an extensive menu of natural juices and smoothies, and a
  variety of vegan entrees, most of which, if I recall correctly, were
  vlf or could be prepared that way. Unprepossessing surroundings, more
  reminiscent of a fast food lunch joint than a fine restaurant, but
  closer to this list's criteria than even the Natural Cafe.

     Wash the anchovies thoroughly under cool water; rub them gently
  between the fingers to remove all salt, and also the skin and fins.
  Rinse, and drain.  Place in a bowl and cover with vinegar; let stand
  until ready to serve, then pour off the vinegar and replace it with a
  dressing of equal amounts of vinegar and oil--enough to just barely
  cover the anchovies. Serve directly from bowl.
  
     NOTE:  These may be eaten in their entirety--bones and all--or the
  bones may be removed.

 Categories: Sandwiches, Seafood
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 cn (4 oz each) Maine Sardines
      1 c  Ketchup
      2 tb Onion; chopped fine
  1 1/2 ts Oregano
    1/4 ts Garlic powder
      6    Hamburger rolls
      2 tb Butter; softened
  1 1/2 c  Cheese; shredded
 
  Drain sardines and cut into large pieces.  Combine ketchup, onion,
  oregano, and garlic powder.  Mix thoroughly. Cut rolls in half and
  spread with butter. Place rolls on a cookie sheet and toast them
  lightly in the oven. Place sardines on rolls and cover with ketchup
  mixture. Sprinkle with cheese.  Bake in a moderate oven, 350 F for 10
  to 15 minutes, or until cheese melts.
  
  Dave's notes:  Dump the ketchup, oregano, and garlic powder and open
  up a jar of Ragu Pizza Quick Sauce, adding the onions. It tastes a
  lot better than the "dumbed down" tomato sauce Uncle Sam came up with
  using ketchup.

      Title: SARIMSAAQLI PALAAW (CENTRAL ASIAN GARLIC PILA
 Categories: Pilaf, Main dish
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Oil
      5 sm Onions, diced
      1 lb Lamb leg meat, cubed
      4 lg Carrots, cut into julienne
           Water
     12    Garlic heads
      5 c  Rice, soaked in 5 changes
           -of water and drained
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Ground cumin
      1 ts Ground red pepper or cayenne
 
  This is recently invented Central Asian pilaf, dating from just after
  World War II. At first popular among teahouse pilaf cooks in eastern
  Uzbekistan, it's now cooked all over that country. Most people squish
  out the mild cooked garlic from the whole cloves and use it as a
  sauce for the pilaf. From "Plovy na Liubol Vkus" by Karim Makhmudov.
  
  Put oil in large pot, add onions and saute over medium heat until
  light brown. Add meat and stir until browned. Add carrots and 5 cups
  water, and cook over medium-high heat until meat is tender, about 7
  minutes. Mix whole heads of garlic into stew and sprinkle rinsed rice
  over. Add 8 cups water, taking care not to disturb layering of rice
  and stew, and boil uncovered until rice absorbs water, about 40-45
  minutes.
  
  When rice is done, heap rice in pot, cover, reduce heat to minimum,
  cover pot and steam 25-30 minutes. Serve 1 head garlic with each
  portion of pilaf. Makes 10-12 servings.

      Yield: 5 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------CHOOSE ONE (ONE PIECE------------------------
      1 lb Fresh Sea Bass Fillet
      1 lb Squid
      1 lb Turbot
      1 lb Tunny Fish
      1 lb Halibut
      1 lb Abalone
      1 lb Bream

MMMMM-----------------------DIPPING SAUCE----------------------------

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
      1 x  2" Secion Diakon
      1 ea Celery
      1 ea Carrot
 
  CUTTING THE FISH: There are 4 basic cuts for Sashimi. A Very sharp,
  heavy knife is a must. 1.  Hara Giri (Flat Cut)  Most popular cut.
  Suitable for any filleted fish.  Holding the fish firmly, cut
  straight down in slices about 1/4" to 1/2" thick and 1" wide,
  depending on the size of the fillet.
  
  2.  Kaku Giri (Cubic Cut)  This style of cutting is more often used
  for tunny fish.  Cut the fish as above, the cut the slices into 1/2"
  cubes.
  
  3. Ito Zukuri (Thread Shape)  Although this technique may be used
  with any small fish, it is especially suitable for squid. Cut the
  squid straight down into 1/4" slices, the cut lengthways into 1/4"
  wide strips.
  
  4.  Usu Zukuri (Paper Thin Slices)  Place a fillet of bass or bream
  on a flat surface and, holding the fish firmly with one hand, slice
  it at an angle into almost transparent sheets.
  
  TO SERVE: Sashimi may be composed of one fish or a variety of fish. To
  serve as part of a meal, arrange the fish attractively on individual
  serving plates.  Garnish each plate with obout 1/2 teaspoon of wasabi
  and decorate with strips of daikon, carrot and/or celery. Cover with
  a sheet of plastic and refrigerate for NO MORE THAN 1 HOUR before
  serving.
      Pour the dipping sauce of your choice into tiny dishes and
  accompany each serving of Sahshimi with it's own sauce. The wasabi
  may be mixed with soy sauce or tosa joyu to taste. To serve as an
  hors d' oerve, arrange two or more varieties or cuts of sashimi on a
  serving dish and accompany with dipping sauce.

  Helpful hints:  Freeze cheese balls at least a few hours before
  baking. Freezing allows cheese to harden so balls hold their shape in
  the oven. Unbaked cheese balls may be kept in the freezer in a
  tightly covered container for up to 2 weeks.

        8 TB crunchy peanut butter
        1    onion, finely chopped
  :          -1"
  :          thick coconut milk
        1 TB palm or brown sugar

  :          chopped
        1 TB fish sauce -- (Nam Pla)
        1 TB dark -- sweet soy sauce
  
  It seems that making "thick" coconut milk is a little involved (I
  would guess you don't go out and buy it) and the following is a
  condensed and paraphrased version of what she says: "When I refer to
  "thick" coconut milk in a recipe, it is made from the first pressing
  of the milk or water through the coconut meat..... To obtain 2 cups
  of "thick" coconut milk, you'll need 2 cups of coconut (she prefers
  to use dried, unsweetened [desiccated] coconut found in health food
  shops or Oriental stores) and 3 cups of whole milk. Scald the milk in
  a saucepan. Place the coconut in the milk.  Stir and remove from
  heat. Let stand until cooled to room temperature, stirring
  occasionally. Strain this mixture through a sieve using the back of a
  spoon to express as much liquid as possible."

    2/3 c  Crunchy peanut butter
  1 1/2 c  Unsweetened coconut milk
    1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Brown sugar or molasses
      1 ts Grated fresh ginger root
      4    Garlic cloves
           -- minced or pressed

    1/4 c  Heavy cream

MMMMM-------------------------GARNISHES------------------------------
           Grated lime zest
           Fresh cilantro sprigs
 
  MARINADE: Combine brown sugar, curry powder, peanut butter, soy
  sauce, lime juice, garlic and crushed chiles to taste in a shallow
  dish. Thread the meat pieces on water soaked bamboo skewers, weaving
  skewers in and out of meat lengthwise to create a serpentine design.
  Place the skewers in the soy sauce mixture. Marinate at room
  temperature for at least 2 hours or in the refrigerator as long as
  overnight for a more intense flavor. PEANUT SAUCE: Combine peanut
  butter, coconut milk, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger,
  garlic and cayenne pepper to taste in a sauce pan over moderate heat
  and cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce is as thick as heavy
  cream, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a food processor or blender and
  puree briefly. Add chicken stock and cream; blend until smooth.
  Reserve. (This mixture may be made several hours ahead and
  refrigerated. Return to room temperature before serving.) Prepare a
  moderate charcoal fire in an open grill or preheat the broiler. Cook
  the skewered meat, turning several times and basting with the
  marinade, over medium-hot coals (or under a broiler) until crispy on
  the outside but still moist inside, about 6 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle
  with lime zest and garnish with cilantro leaves. Serve with the
  peanut sauce for dipping. Makes about 18 skewers; allow 2 per serving
  as an appetizer, 4 or more as a main coarse. For a main dish, serve
  with steamed rice, salad and grilled or steamed asparagus or other
  vegetable.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 kg (1 1/4 lb) fillet  of pork
      1 tb Melted pork fat or  butter
      1    Clove garlic, crushed
      2 ts Dark soya sauce

      1 ts Ground ginger
      1 ts Five spices
      1 tb Clear honey
    1/2 ts White pepper
 
  An important difference between this and other kinds of sates is that
  we do not usually eat pork with peanut sauce. We eat it by itself, or
  with Sambal Kecap.
  
  Cut the pork into small thin squares and marinate for 2 hours. Push
  on to bamboo or metal skewers.  Put these on a rack or in a roasting
  tin and cook in a preheated oven at 350F (gas mark 4) for 30 minutes,
  turning them over several times.
  
  Mix the fat (or butter) with the crushed garlic, soya sauce and lemon
  juice. just before serving, brush the sate with this soya and lemon
  mixture, and grill for 2 to 3 minutes. Serve immediately.
  
  Most readers will know that the 'five spices' used in this recipe are
  a Chinese ingredient, the mixture being composed of star anise,
  fennel, cloves, cinnamon and pepper.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

  1 1/2 c  Coconut milk
      6    Shallots
      3 lg Juicy cloves garlic

      1 ts Curry powder
    1/2 ts Red pepper flakes or cayenne

           -butter
      5    Bay leaves
           Juice from a lemon
           Fish sauce
 
  PROCEDURES
  
  Prepare marinade in blender or food processor.  Set aside. Bone
  chicken and cut into cubes around 1/2 inch on a side. Slide cubes
  onto soaked wooden or flat metal skewers.  (Make the satehs the right
  length for your bbq or broiler.)
  
  Load the satehs into a shallow bowl or baking dish. Slather with
  marinade. Let sit in fridge for 2-24 hours.
  
  To make peanut sauce, peel and chop lemon grass, shallots and garlic.
  The lemon grass should be chopped very finely. Heat oil in a skillet.
  When hot, saute the shallots, garlic, lemon grass, curry powder and
  pepper flakes or cayenne for 2 or 3 minutes, until light brown. (Use
  hood fan - intense fumes!)
  
  Stir in the chicken stock, lemon juice, around 3 tablespoons fish
  sauce, and bay leaves.  Simmer gently for a few minutes.
  
  Now stir in coconut milk and about 2 tbsp ground peanuts or chunky
  peanut butter.  Cook gently, stirring constantly, until hot but not
  quite bubbling (coconut milk has a tendency to curdle if cooked too
  hot). TASTE IT. The peanut flavor should be in there, but subtle.
  Adjust flavors to your satisfaction with hot pepper, fish sauce
  and/or peanut until it's right on. Cook down gently to desired
  thickness (or thin with chicken broth or water), and take off heat.
  Reheat gently when about to serve the satehs.
  
  Get your rice going, and start barbecuing or broiling the satehs.
  Stockpile them in a warm oven until all are done. Serve satehs with
  rice, both drenched in peanut sauce. Pass more peanut sauce around
  the table, along with a heat source for those who want more fire,
  such as vinegar/fish sauce/lime juice/fresh hot pepper/honey.

      Title: SATURDAY MARKET ELEPHANT EARS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1 pk Dry yeast
      1 c  Warm water
      2    Eggs beaten
      4 c  Flour
      6 tb Sugar
 
  Servings: 12
  
  Sugar and cinnamon mix - set aside
  
  Soften yeast in warm water.  Combine all ingredients except the
  cinnamon sugar  mix.  Mix well.  Divide dough into 12 pieces. Let sit
  10 minutes. Roll out on a lightly floured board. Using hands, stretch
  each piece into circular shape. Heat vegetable oil in 10 skillet
  (cast iron is best). Place each circle of dough in the hot grease.
  Turn once - the surface will bubble and blister and should be lightly
  browned. Turn with spatula and broad knife.  Place on absorbent paper
  toweling. Sprinkle immediately with mix of sugar and cinnamon. If you
  tear a hole in the circle as it is being stretched that will not
  matter.
  
  This will be a favorite for all ages.  The recipe has been around a
  long time, but each time we make them someone has never heard of
  individuals making them.

 Categories: Beef, Pulses and
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Salt Beef
      2 lb Mixed Produce -- * see note
    1/2 lb Pumpkin
     12    Ochroes
      6    Green Bananas
      2 lg Potatoes
    1/2 lb Red Beans -- or split peas
      1 sm Onion -- per person
      2    Carrots
           -Seasonings-----
           Garlic
           Scotch Bonnet
           Green Onions
           Thyme -- etc.
 
  * yam, tannia, cassava, dasheen etc.
  
  1. Put the salt beef to soak overnight. 2. Cut into small pieces and
  cover with water (2 pints). 3. Bring to the boil and simmer gently
  for 1
      1/2    hours with beans or peas. 4. Add peeled and cut up
  produce. 5. Add the onions (quartered), pumpkin (cut up), chopped
  seasonings and ochroes. 6. Cook until vegetables are tender.
  
  Tip #1:  You can add any type of meat to "beef" up this basically
  meatless dish e.g. chicken, beef, pork etc. The only requirement is
  that the pieces remain large otherwise they will disappear in the
  soup. Tip #2: You can make some flour dumplings and plunk them in the
  soup about 1/2 hour before you are ready. Tip #3: This soup gets very
  thick very fast! A little water and butter will thin it out.

 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
     12    Cloves garlic, peeled
    100 g  Mushrooms, sliced
      1 c  Skim milk
      1 tb Strong stock
      1 ts Parsley, chopped
      1 pn Nutmeg
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  There are countless versions of garlic sauce around the world. The
  French ones mostly involve emulsions of eggs and oil with raw garlic,
  such as aioli, a garlic mayonnaise, and rouille, which includes
  roasted red capsicum. South-East Asian garlic sauces are more
  waistline-friendly, usually variations on a combination of raw
  garlic, vinegar and sugar. But there is one enjoyable French sauce
  which is low in kilojoules and won't leave you reeking either. It's
  from the era of cuisine minceur (remem- ber that?).
  
  Cover 12 peeled cloves of garlic with water and bring to the boil.
  Simmer for 10 minutes, then drain and discard the water. Return the
  garlic cloves to the saucepan and add 100 g sliced mushrooms, a cup
  of skim or fat modified milk, a tablespoon of very strong stock, 1
  teaspoon chopped parsley, a pinch of nutmeg and salt and pepper to
  taste. Simmer gently for 20 minutes then puree the mixture in a
  blender or food processor. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.
  Good with grilled or roasted poultry.

  It only takes 5 minutes to cook. Combine ingredients in saucepan.
  Cook and stir occasionally over low heat for 5 minutes.
    Place chicken pieces in large pan and bake in 350 degree oven for 30
  minutes without sauce. Then pour sauce over chicken & cook an
  additional 30 minutes, basting OFTEN. Note:watch and check every five
  minutes to keep it from burning during the last 15 mins. Hope you can

 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 2 1/2 cups
 
      2 oz Slab bacon; diced
      2 lg Onions; chopped
      2 lg Carrots, peeled & chopped
      3 lg Shallots; minced

      1    Bouquet garni
      2 c  Brown stock
      1 tb Peppercorns, green; cracked
           Salt; to taste
    1/4 c  Brandy
 
  Saut^B the bacon in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat for 2
  minutes. Add the onions, carrots, shallots, and leek and cook until
  well browned, about 12 to 15 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and simmer
  over low heat until the liquid has evaporated, about 10 to 15
  minutes. Whisk in the flour and cook one minute more. Then add the
  garlic, wine, bouquet garni and stock. Simmer over low heat for one
  hour.  Stir in the cracked peppercorns and salt then simmer for 10
  minutes more. strain through a sieve lined with a layer of
  cheesecloth.  Return to the saucepan and add the brandy. Simmer 3
  minutes over low heat and serve hot. This easy version of the classic
  pepper sauce clearly illustrates why some old-time combinations just
  cannot be improved upon.  Serve this with beef or game, especially
  pheasant. This sauce will also keep for two days in the refrigerator.
  Re-warm over low heat before serving.

  wish. Place sauce in small individual dishes for each diner.

  blender. Process until creamy. Slowly add remaining oil at high speed
  until mixture resembles mayonnaise. Transfer to a bowl and add sour
  cream, soy sauce, main and broth.  Place sauce in small individual
  dishes for each diner.

 Categories: Sauces, Meats
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------FOR SPICED KUMQUAT SAUCE-----------------------
      5    Kumquats
      3    Bay leaves
      9    Whole cloves; bruised
    3/4 pt Stock, pref. from tongue
      1 lg Orange (juice only)
      2 ts Lemon juice
      1 tb Tarragon vinegar
    3/4 oz Butter
      2 tb Flour
           Salt and pepper
      4 tb Thick cream

MMMMM-----------------FOR PARSLEY & CAPER SAUCE----------------------
      1    Garlic clove
      1 oz Parsely; chopped
    1/2 oz Chives
  1 1/2 oz Capers
      1 sm Lemon; juice & zest only
      8 fl Oil
           Black pepper
 
  FOR SPICED KUMQUAT SAUCE: Slice and remove the pips from the
  kumquats. Put them into a pan with the bay leaves, cloves, stock,
  orange juice, lemon juice and tarragon vinegar. Bring very slowly to
  the boil. Add a little salt and pepper, cover and set aside for 20
  minutes to infuse. Strain, reserving the kumquats, liquid and spices
  separately. Make a smooth sauce with the butter, flour and cooking
  liquid. Return spices to the pan and simmer uncovered for 20 minutes.
  Stir regularly to prevent sticking and to stop a skin from forming.
  By the end of this time, the sauce should be the consistency of
  cream; if necessary boil it hard for 2-3 minutes to reduce and
  thicken it a little. Strain to extract the spices, stir in the cream,
  then the kumquats. Reheat gently, adding a few pinches of ground
  cloves, more lemon juice and other seasonings to taste.
  
  FOR PARSLEY & CAPER SAUCE:  Crush the garlic clove with a little
  salt. Then process it briefly with the chopped parsley, chives and
  capers. Add the lemon juice and zest, and the oil and whizz again
  until the mixture is reduced to a thickened fragrant green puree. Add
  a coarse grinding of black pepper and leave it for 1 hour or so to
  allow the flavours to blend.

      Title: SAUCES TO GO WITH MOROCCAN COUSCOUS
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------SWEET ONION AND RAISIN SAUCE---------------------
      2    Small, hot fresh peppers
    1/3 c  Butter
      1 c  Raisins
      2 ts Cinnamon
      1 ts Pepper
      1 c  Sugar or honey
 
  Start this at least 1 hour before serving so that it can get a
  mahogany color.  Saute onions in butter, stirring frequently, until
  they soften and turn golden. Add other ingredients and cook and stir,
  letting mixture almost burn on the bottom a few times before stirring
  it up. In this way it will be a lovely, dark brown. Hot Sauce: Remove
  2 or 3 ladles of broth to small saucepan about 20 min. before serving
  and simmer with whole hot peppers. I have not tried these receipes
  but they do sound good. Later I will post some of my couscous
  receipes. Also want to prepare and also post a receipe for beef
  brochettes. Gary, if you are reading this I doubt if we could ever
  duplicate the Moroccan cooking. The country and the atmosphere had a
  lot to do with the flavor of the food. Hope you don't mind someone
  else adding their 2 cents. My husband was stationed in Morocco from
  1970-72.  The Couscous postings brought back wonderful memories. In
  fact, thanks to Gary's posting my husband and I bought a steamer.
  Now, all I have to do is purchase some cheesecloth so the couscous
  does not fall through the holes. I also dug out my old Morocccan
  cookbook, COOKING IN MOROCCO by the American Women's Association of
  Rabat. Lots of Coucous receipes, but none calling for harissa.  Did
  find 2 receipes for sauces to be served with couscous. Carolyn in

      Title: SAUCEY BLACK BEANS
 Categories: Digest
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 c  Dry black beans, soaked
           Overnight
     12 c  Water
      1 x  Grated peel from one orange
      4    Vidalia onions, chopped
    1/2 cn Mild green chilis
      2    16 oz cans stewed or canned
           Tomatoes
      1 ts Molido (dried Mexican
           Oregeno)
      4    Cloves minced garlic
 
  Drain the soaking water from the beans and add the 12c water. Bring
  to a boil, reduce heat and cook at a fast simmer for 1 to 1 1/2
  hours, when beans just start to get soft. Add all other ingredients
  except the molido and cook until beans are truly soft. Add molido,
  stir in well, turn off burner and allow to sit for 30 minutes. Serve
  over rice or corn bread, or use in enchiladas.
  
  Beans behave slightly differently with every batch I buy, so adjust
  the cooking time according to taste.  I can tell by the smell that
  they are done. If the beans seem too liquid, leave the lid off after
  adding the onions and allow them to cook down.
  
  NOTE:  I personally prefer 2t of molido, but this is a bit much for
  some folks. I'll bet it would be good with the fresh stuff, if I
  could ever find it!
