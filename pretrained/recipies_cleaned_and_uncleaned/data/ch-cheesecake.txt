Allison's Chocolate Cheesecake

frozen

1  h
1  chocolate crumb crust
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 tablespoon butter (1/2 stick),melted
3 cup chocolate-wafer crumbs
1  h
1  filling
3/4 cup sugar
3  eggs
1 1/2 pound cream cheese, softened
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, melted; and cooled
2 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoon instant espresso powder, dissolved; in 1 tsp boiling water
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cup sour cream
4 tablespoon butter (1/2 stick),melted
1  h
1/2 cup heavy cream, whipped
6  candied violets, for garnish

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
To make the crust, mix all the ingredients with a fork until well
blended.  Pour into a 10-inch springform pan, and press the crumbs
firmly against the sides with your hands, working them up the pan as
far as possible.  Press a thin layer of crumbs on the bottom of the
pan.  Chill while you make the filling.
Cream the sugar and eggs in a large mixing bowl.  Stir in the cream
cheese, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing well after each addition.
Stir in the melted chocolate and the rest of the ingredients in the
order given, except the cream and the violets.  Mix well, and pour
into the chilled crust.
Bake cake for 50 to 60 minutes.  The cake will jiggle in the middle
when moved and look underdone, but it will solidify as it cools.  Let
it sit for 30 minutes after taking it from the oven, then refrigerate
for 3 to 4 hours or overnight before unmolding.
Decorate with small mounds of whipped cream dropped on top by the
teaspoonful or piped on in rosettes, and add candied violets, if
using. Serve with a bowl of extra whipped cream, if desired.

CANDIED VIOLETS: Use only fresh, perfect blossoms.  Rinse then well
and pat dry.  With a tiny brush, paint the petals with a lightly
beaten egg white, then sprinkle with extrafine sugar.  Lay the coated
blossoms on a piece of wire mesh, such as a large strainer, placed
over a piece of waxed paper.  Let dry for several hours at room
temperature before storing in an airtight container.  These will keep
indefinitely.

Amaretto Chocolate Cheesecake

cheese cake

      ----CRUST----
7 ounce amaretti (see note)
2 tablespoon granulated sugar
5 tablespoon sweet butter
1 ounce chocolate, unsweetened (1 square)
      ----FILLING----
6 ounce chocolate, semisweet
7 ounce amaretti
4 ounce almond paste
1/3 cup amaretto liqueur
1/4 cup sugar, granulated
1 1/2 pound cream cheese (room temperature)
4 large eggs
1/2 cup heavy cream

MAKE CRUST:  Butter the sides only (not the bottom) of a 9-inch spring-form
pan (about 2 1/2 to 3 inches deep).  Grind the Amaretti very fine in a food
processor or blender.  Mix with sugar in a mixing bowl.

Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler, stirring
occasionally.  Add the melted mixture to the Amaretti crumbs and sugar and
mix thoroughly. (Don't wash the double boiler; you'll be using it again in
a minute.)

Turn the mixture into the prepared pan.  With your fingers, distribute it
evenly over the bottom and press it down into a very firm, compact layer.
Refrigerate while you prepare the filling.

MAKE FILLING:  Adjust rack 1/3 up from the bottom of the oven and preheat
to 350 degrees F. Partially melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler,
then uncover and stir until completely melted. Remove the top of the double
boiler and set aside to cool.

Break the Amaretti coarsely into a bowl and set aside.  Cut the almond
paste into small pieces, and beat on low speed with an electric mixer,
while gradually adding the Amaretto liqueur. Beat until thoroughly mixed
and set aside.

Beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth.  Add the sugar
and beat until smooth again. Add the almond paste-Amaretto mixture and beat
until thoroughly mixed. Add the melted chocolate and beat well again. Add
the eggs one at a time, beating at low speed until they are incorporated
after each addition. Add the heavy cream and beat until smooth. Add the
coarsely broken Amaretti and stir gently only to mix.

Turn into the prepared pan, pouring the mixture over the bottom crust.
Rotate the pan gently to level the batter. (Don't worry if the mixture
comes almost to the top; it won't run over.)

Bake 45 minutes.  It will seem soft and not done, but don't bake any more;
it will become firm when chilled. The top of the cake is supposed to look
bumpy because of the large chunks of Amaretti. Let cool completely at room
temperature, then carefully remove the sides of the pan and refrigerate the
cake (still on the bottom of the pan) for 4 to 6 hours, or overnight.

NOTES:

*  This is adapted from Maida Heatter's "Book of Great Chocolate Desserts,"
(Knopf 1980).  It won me a blue ribbon at the Martha's Vineyard
Agricultural Exhibition and Fair in 1983. If you ever find yourself in
front of a firing squad, this makes an unbeatable last request.

*  Amaretti are Italian almond-flavored wafer cookies.  They are usually
sold in metal tins with the wafers wrapped in packages of two inside the
tin. You can also buy Amarettini, which are the same flavor but much
smaller and not individually wrapped. Since you're going to grind some of
the wafers and break the others into chunks, it doesn't matter which size
you start with. One brand is Amaretti di Saronna, Lazzaroni and Co.

*  This is an expensive cake, both in terms of the cost of the ingredients
($15-$20) and the number of calories.

: Difficulty:  moderate to hard.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 45 minutes baking, overnight cooling.
: Precision:  measure ingredients carefully.

Bo's Chocolate Chip Cheesecake

cheese cake

24 ounce cream cheese, broken into pieces
4  eggs, separated
2 tablespoon vanilla extract (do not use artific; ial vanilla)
1 cup sour cream
1/4 cup brown sugar, or to taste
1 pound chocolate chips
1 pound graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup butter, melted

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.

PREPARE THE BATTER:  Place the egg yolks in a food processor for 5 seconds,
then add the cream cheese and beat until smooth.  Add the brown sugar and
vanilla and process for several minutes, or until the batter is very
smooth. Beat the egg whites and fold into the cheese mixture. Set aside.

PREPARE THE CRUST:  Soften butter and combine with graham cracker crumbs.
Mix until fully blended, e.g. they will form a ball when squeezed in your
hand or by a spoon. Pat the crust into the sides and bottom of a springform
pan about 9 inches in diameter.

Spread a generous layer of chips on the bottom of the pan, and then pour
the batter into the pan. Add another generous layer of chips to the top of
the cake.

Place the filled pan into the preheated oven.  Baking time will vary from
about 30 minutes to 2 hours.  Cooking time depends on whether you want a
soft, gooey "New York" style cheesecake (shorter) to a fluffy
"souffle"-like cheesecake (longer). The longer you cook it, the fluffier it
gets.

When the cake starts to rise like a souffle, start checking to see if it is
done.  It will just about double in volume, and should not flow over the
sides of the pan. If the cake shimmers like Jello when shaken, it is done.
Alternatively, if a knife inserted comes out clean, the cake is overcooked:
the knife should be very lightly coated with batter.

NOTES:

*  A truly decadent chocolate chip cheesecake -- This recipe came to me
from a friend of mine, Bo (pronounced "boo") Ture Ahlberg, who would
occasionally (read "whenever we could persuade him") bring it into work.
Needless to say, it would be snarfed up immediately.

*  Bo prefers to use Nestle Mini-Morsel chocolate chips.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, up to 2 hours cooking.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

Author's Notes: You may have seen this on the cover of a recent
magazine when you were standing in the grocery line. It makes a very
rich, truly decadent chocolate cheesecake. A chocolate wafer is a
crisp chocolate cookie about three inches in diameter and an eigth of
an inch thick. If you can't find them, you can substitute any kind of
dry crunchy chocolate-flavored cookie. You can make the crust and
filling in a food processor if you have one. It makes it a lot easier.

Difficulty    : moderate. Precision
: measure carefully.

Chocolate Peanut Butter Cheesecake

1 1/2 cup sugar
6  eggs
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cup heavy cream
10 ounce semisweet chocolate; melted
1 cup peanut butter; smooth or crunchy

Recipe by: Rebecca Oeswein <oeswein@dadd.ti.com> Preheat oven to 300
F.

In a large bowl, beat together cream cheese and sugar until light and
fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes.  Beat in eggs, one at a time. Add vanilla,
beat until smooth.  Add heavy cream, beat till well blended.

Transfer 1/3 of batter to another bowl and set aside. Beat melted
chocolate into remaining batter.  Pour into crust. With mixer on
medium speed, beat peanut butter into remaining 1/3 batter until
thoroughly mixed. Carefully spoon peanut butter mixture on top of
chocolate cheese mixture in pan. Using the long handle of a wooden
spoon, swirl the two flavors together.

Bake about 1 hour, or until cheesecake is set around edges and puffed
but still jiggles slightly in the center. Let cake cool 2 hours, then
refrigerate until well chilled, 8 hrs. or overnight.

For a crust, I use Oreo cookie crumbs and make a crust using their
recipe. I also do not swirl the flavors together. I like them layered
better.

Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake Brownies

cookies

6 ounce semisweet chocolate; chopped
3 ounce unsweetened chocolate; chopped
2  cream cheese; softened
2 cup sugar
4  eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 cup butter; softened
1 cup flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup raspberry jam

Swirls of raspberry jam and cream cheese against a dense, rich
chocolate background make these a feast for the eyes and a
can't-miss-a-crumb treat for the mouth.

Dufflet Rosenberg is famous in Toronto for her "Dufflet's Pastries"
shop in Toronto. Anything she makes is marvellous.

Directions:

In heatproof bowl set over hot (not boiling) water, melt semisweet
with unsweetened chocolate. Remove from heat; stir until smooth. Let
cool to lukewarm. In large bowl, beat cream cheese with 1/3 cup of
the sugar until smooth. Beat in 1 of the eggs and 1 teaspoon of the
vanilla until well combined. Set aside. In separate large bowl, beat
butter with remaining sugar until smooth. Beat in remaining eggs, one
at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in remaining
vanilla, then chocolate, mixing well. Mix in flour and salt just
until combined.

Line a 13 x 9 inch cake pan with foil, leaving overhand for "handles".

Reserve 1 cup of the chocolate batter. Spread remaining chocolate
batter in pan. Spread with cream cheese mixture. Spoon reserved
chocolate batter in dollops over top.

Spoon jam in smaller dollops among chocolate dollops. With knife,
zigzag through layers for marble effect.

Bake in 350F oven for 35 minutes or until tester inserted 2 inches
from centre comes out slightly moist. Let cool on rack. Using foil
handles, lift onto cutting board; cut into squares.

(Can be refrigerated in airtight container for up to 4 days; bring to
room temperature).

1 1/4 cup graham cracker crumbs
3/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoon sugar
1/4 cup unslated butter; melted
6 ounce semisweet chocolate
1/4 cup rum
1 pound cream cheese
1/2 cup sour cream
1 tablespoon vanilla
5  eggs

Preheat oven to 325~. Butter inside of springform pan well and cover the
outside (bottom and sides) with a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil,
shiny side out. This reflects heat away from cheesecake and prevents it
from baking too fast and becoming overcooked. Mix graham cracker crumbs
with 2 tb of the sugar and add melted butter. Press evenly on bottom and
sides of pan; refrigerate until ready to use. Cut chocolate into
small pieces. Melt in microwave; combine with rum. Set aside. Beat
cream cheese with electric mixer until ight and fluffy. Gradually beat
in sugar, sour cream and vanilla. Add eggs, one at a time. Mix well.
Place bowl over a pan of hot water and mix until smooth (do not let
water touch bottom of bowl). Pour about 1 1/4 cups of this batter
into a separte bowl and set aside. Whisk remaining batter w/the
chocolate, then stir over hot water until smooth. Take springform pan
from refrigerator and fill w/chocolate batter. Gently pour plain batter
over top and make swirls down into the chocolate batter with a fork.
Place on middle rack of oven and bake for 50 minutes. Cool to room
temp, remove foil and rim of pan and refrigerate overnight.

12 ounce white chocolate
2 cup pound cake crumbs *
1 1/2 pound cream cheese, softened
1 cup sugar
2 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 tablespoon apricot brandy
2 cup sour cream

* or use graham cracker crumbs
Melt white chocolate over low heat in a double boiler. Set aside to
cool slightly. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Distribute pound cake
crumbs evenly over the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Press
crumbs down lightly. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream together cream
cheese, sugar, vanilla, and apricot brandy with an electric mixer for

combine. Pour into crumb lined pan and bake at 350 degrees for 30
minutes. Chill overnight before serving.

This cheesecake freezes very well, and makes about 12-14 slices. It
goes well with commercial fruit sauces or fresh fruit but it is so
delicious that it really doesn't need anything else! It does look
nice when it is garnished with fresh raspberries and mint sprigs
though. This one has been described as "to die for"!!!

Low-Fat Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake

cheese cake, deserts, low fat

24  plain chocolate wafer
1  cookies (half of a 9 ounce
1  box)
1  nonfat cooking spray
2  (8 ounce) packages fat-free
1  cream cheese
1 cup sugar
1 cup cocoa
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3 tablespoon sugar-free seedless black
1  raspberry preserves
1/2 cup fat free egg substitutes
1  (16 ounce) container
1  fat-free sour cream
1/4 teaspoon salt

For Fruit Topping:

1 (10 ounce) box sweetened frozen raspberries, thawed
2    Tablespoons cornstarch

In a food processor or blender, grind the plain chocolate wafers into
fine crumbs. Generously coat a 8.1/2 inch or 9 inch springform pan
with nonstick cooking spray. Pour the crumbs into the pan and tilt to
coat the bottom and the sides evenly. Set aside.

Preheat oven to 350^F. With an electric mixer, beat the fat-free cream
cheese until soft. Add the sugar, cocoa, vanilla extract and raspberry
preserves and continue beating until the ingredients are
incorporated. Add the egg substitutes, fat free sour cream and salt
and continue beating until no lumps remain and mixture is smooth and
liquid. You may have to beat the mixture for several minutes to reach
this consistency.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Place in oven and immediately
reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees. Bake for one hour, or until
center is set and firm to the touch. Turn off oven and allow
cheesecake to stay in cooling oven for one hour longer. Remove and
cool completely. Refrigerate overnight before serving.

To make the raspberry sauce, puree the raspberries in a food
processor or blender. Strain the pulp through a tea strainer,
pressing to remove all the seeds. Discard seeds. Place the cornstarch
in a saucepan and stir in the raspberry juice. Bring to a boil,
stirring constantly until thickened. Remove from heat immediately to
prevent lumps from forming. Cool and chill. Serve one tablespoon of
sauce on top of each slice of cheesecake.

Cake can also be frozen for two to three weeks before serving. To
serve, thaw for 2 days in the refrigerator, then allow to come to
room temperature before slicing.

when oven has cooled. Loosen cake from rim of pan.

I think cheesecake in general is best when chilled over night, but it
is not necessary.

Warm Chocolate Cakes-Martha Stewart Living

chocolate, cheese cake, deserts

14 ounce best-quality bittersweet chocolate
6 tablespoon heavy cream
6 tablespoon unsalted butter, plus more for tins
5 large eggs, separated
10 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
3/4 cup ground almonds
1  confectioners' sugar, for dusting (; opt.)

1. To make ganache, chop 2 ounce of the chocolate into small pieces and
place in small bowl. Pour cream into a small saucepan and heat until
bubbles appear around edge. Pour hot cream over chocolate, let stand
several minutes, and stir until smooth. Pour ganache into 6 squares
of a plastic ice-cube tray. Freeze until solid.

2. Butter six 3-inch metal baking rings and place on a parchment-lined
baking sheet; set aside.

3. Melt butter and remaining 12 ounce chocolate in a heatproof bowl over
simmering water. Stir until smooth. Let cool slightly.

4. Meanwhile, combine egg yolks, 6 tablespoons of the sugar, and the
vanilla in bowl of an electric mixer. Beat until thick and pale
yellow, 5 to 8 minutes. Add chocolate butter mixture and thoroughly
combine. Fold in ground almonds.

5. In a separate bowl, beat remaining 4 tablespoons sugar with the egg
whites until stiff. Fold into egg yolk-chocolate mixture. Spoon about
3 tablespoon of batter into each ring. Remove frozen ganache cubes from
freezer; you may need to dip the bottom of the ice tray in hot water
to get them out. Place a cube in the center of each ring. Spoon
remaining batter into rings, being careful to keep ganache cubes in
center and cover them completely. Freeze filled molds until solid,
about 1 hour.

6. Heat oven to 375'. Take baking sheet from a freezer. Wrap any
cakes to be saved and replace in freezer; leave the rest on sheet.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool 5 to 10
minutes. To unmold, cover one hand with a clean dish towel and pick
cake up on a spatula with the other. Invert cake into hand, pull off
ring, then invert again onto a plate and dust with confectioners'
sugar, if desired. Serve immediately.

White Chocolate Amaretto Cheesecake

chocolate, cheese cake, alcohol

1  <--cheesecake-->
1  1/2 c. sugar (up to 1)
1 1/2 pound (3 pkgs) softened cream cheese
3  eggs
8  9 ounce. good quality white chocola
3 tablespoon heavy cream
1 cup sour cream
1/4 cup amaretto
1  <--topping-->
1 cup sour cream
1 cup confectioner's sugar

Use butter cookie or brown sugar cookie dough to make a crust. Or
make a cookie crumb crust.

Cheesecake: Beat cream cheese until fluffy. Gradually beat in sugar.
Beat in eggs one at a time. Melt white chocolate with heavy cream (in
double boiler or in microwave, but if using microwave, stop and stir
every 20 seconds). Beat white chocolate, Amaretto, and sour cream
into batter. Beat a while longer. Bake in preheated 350 degree oven
55-60 minutes. If top starts to become too brown, cover w/ foil
part-way through baking. Or refrigerate cake and just slice top off
cheesecake when cool.

Topping: Whisk together. Add a touch of Amaretto or vanilla. Spoon
over top of cake, letting some drip over the sides.

Serve w/ fresh fruit, if desired.

Notes: (1) You'll probably want less than 1 1/2 cups of sugar since
the white chocolate and the Amaretto are both sweet. Add 1 cup, taste
batter, then add more if needed. (2) Suggested chocolates: Tobler
Narcisse, Lindt, Valhrona white chocolate couverture, Callebaut, etc.)

4  eggs
1 cup sugar
12 ounce white chocolate

Soften the cream cheese in the microwave. Melt the chocolate in a
double boiler. Be careful not to get any water at all in the white
chocolate as it changes the consistency. Hershey's white chocolate
bars can be used for the white chocolate. Add sugar and eggs to cream
cheese and blend a bit. Blend in the chocolate. Pour the mixture into
a graham cracker crust and bake for 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Let
cool slightly in oven with heat off and door slightly ajar.

chocolate, cheese cake

12 ounce white chocolate
2 cup pound cake crumbs
1 1/2 pound cream cheese, softened
1 cup sugar
2 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 tablespoon apricot brandy
2 cup sour cream

Melt white chocolate over low heat in a double boiler.
Set aside to cool slightly.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Distribute
pound cake crumbs evenly over the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan.
Press crumbs down lightly. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream together
cream cheese, sugar, vanilla, and apricot brandy with an electric
mixer for at least five minutes or until very smooth.  Add melted
white chocolate and blend another five minutes. Add sour cream and
mix to combine. Pour into crumb lined pan and bake at 350 degrees for
30 minutes. Chill overnight before serving. This cheesecake freezes
very well, and makes about 12-14 slices. It goes well with commercial
fruit sauces or fresh fruit but it is so delicious that it really
doesn't need anything else! It does look nice when it is garnished
with fresh raspberries and mint sprigs though.  This one has been
described as "to die for"!!! From: Karen Henson/Prodigy

1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup sour cream
2 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa
      ----RASPBERRY SAUCE----
2 1/2 cup raspberries

Place chocolate in a double boiler and heat over hot water until it
melts. Stir to blend and let cool to room temperature.

With an electric mixer, blend cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in
eggs, vanilla, and sour cream.  Stir in melted chocolate. NOTE: it is
important to have the cheesecake ingredients and the melted chocolate
close to the same temperature when they are combined so that they
blend together smoothly.  Pour into a greased 9-inch springform pan.
Bake in the middle of a preheated 325F oven for 25 minutes or until
just barely set. Turn off the oven, leave the door ajar, and let cool
