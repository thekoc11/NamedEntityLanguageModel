Adobo (Smoked Chile Marinade) #1

marinade

8  cloves of garlic, unpeeled
4  dried chiles anchos
1  stemmed,seeded,deveined
1  about 2 ounces
6  dried chiles guajillos
1  stemmed,seeded,deveined
1  about 1 1/2 ounces
1/2  inch stick cinnamon
1  about 1/2 t ground
1  clove, or a pinch ground
10  black peppercorns
1  scant 1/4 t ground
2 large bay leaves broken up
1/8 teaspoon cumin seed, or 1/8 t ground
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup cider vinegar

Toasting the chiles and garlic. Roast the garlic cloves on a griddle or
heavy skillet over medium heat, turning frequently, until blackened in
spots and VERY soft, about 15 minutes. Remove, cool, skin and roughly chop.
While the garlic is roasting, tear the chiles into flat pieces and toast
them a few at a time: Use a metal spatula to press them firmly against the
hot surface for a few seconds, until they blister, crackle and change
color, then flip them over and press them flat to toast the other side.
Soaking the dried chiles. Break the chiles into a small bowl, cover with
boiling water, weight with a plate to keep submerged and soak 30 minutes.
Drain, tear into smaller pieces, place in a blender jar and add the garlic.
Finishing the Adobo. In a mortar or spice grinder, pulverize the cinnamon,
cloves, peppercorns, bay leaves and cumin. Add the chiles along with the
oregano, thyme, salt, vinegar and 3 Tb water. With a long series of blender
pulses, reduce the mixture to a paste. Run the blender for a few seconds
until the mixture clogs, then scrape down the sides with a spatula and
stir; repeat a dozen times or more until the mixture is smooth. Don't add
water unless absolutely necessary or this marinating paste won't do its job
well. Strain the paste through a medium-mesh sieve into a noncorrosive
container with a tight-fitting lid. Cover and refrigerate.
Considerations: After soaking the chiles, they can be put through a foley
food mill to remove the skins and the seeds. Add this puree along with the
garlic to the small blender jar and proceed. If this is done, and the
mixture is put together in a small blender jar, and pulsed, scraped down,
and mixed very well the final sieving can be eliminated.
All of the chiles can be Ancho or Guajillo. You can substitute 3 1/2
ounces of California or New Mexican chiles  for the above chiles but the
flavor will be light.
Adobo with powdered chiles: For a darker, stronger tasting adobo made
without the tedious series of blender runs, roast the chiles and garlic as
directed above, then pulverize the chiles with the cinnamon,cloves,pepper,
bay leaves and cumin in several batches in a spice grinder; sift through a
medium-mesh sieve. Skin the garlic and mash it to a smooth paste. Mix with
the powdered chile mixture, oregano, thyme, salt, vinegar and 6 Tb water.
Store as directed above.

Basturma (Georgian Pomegranate Marinated Grilled Lamb)

meats, marinade, asian, barbecue

1 3/4 lb boneless leg of lamb
1  for the marinade:
2 cup fresh pomegranate juice (or
1 cup pomegranate syrup)
1 small onion, grated
2  cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1  freshly ground black pepper
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro,
1  plus
1/4 cup for garnish
1  bay leaf, crushed
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1  freshly ground black pepper
1  salt
1  lemon wedges for serving

From: Nov/Dec issue On The Grill magazine For subscription information,
send mail to OnTheGrill@aol.com

In the Republic of Georgia, basturma is a sort of shish kebab (Elsewhere in
the Near East, the term refers to spiced dried meat and is etymologically
related to our word pastrami.) Georgians love the combination of fruit and
meat with pomegranate juice as a common seasoning. If you can't find fresh
pomegranates, use pomegranate syrup (sometimes called pomegranate
molasses), which is sold in Middle East and Armenian markets. This recipe
comes from my friend, Darra Goldstein, author of The Georgian Feast (Harper
Collins).

Serves 4

Cut the lamb into 1 1/2-inch cubes, trimming off excess fat or sinew.
(Leave a little fat intact.)

Prepare the marinade.  To juice a fresh pomegranate, cut it in half and
press it on a citrus reamer.  Strain juice into a large non-reactive bowl.
Stir in the remaining marinade ingredients.  Add the lamb and marinate for
at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.

Thread lamb onto skewers and season with salt and pepper.  Build the fire
and let it die down to embers. Oil the grill.  Rake a 1-inch layer of
glowing coals beneath it. Generously season the kebabs with salt; grill,
basting with any excess marinade, until the lamb is cooked to taste, 4 to 6
minutes per side.  Transfer the kebabs to a platter, sprinkle with the
remaining cilantro and serve with lemon wedges.

1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon dijon mustard
1 tablespoon mixed herbs

best for this.. remember use only good sherry... not over salted
cooking sherry.. if you cant drink it you shouldnt cook with it. This
is enough for about 2 lb chicken which should marinate in this for
several hours before it goes to the grill.. this can also be used as
basting sauce but watch out for flare ups of oil on hot coals... Ken.

Berbere Marinade

marinade, spicy

1 small onion
2 small cloves garlic (2 t.)
1  inch piece fresh ginger
2 teaspoon cracked black peppercorns
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes or to taste
1 teaspoon coriander seeds
1 teaspoon cardamom seeds
1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds, optional
1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
1 tablespoon salt or to taste
1/3 cup imported paprika
1/2 cup olive oil

Source: FOODday, July 9, '91 From: Valerie Whittle

The Berberes are a nomadic tribe in northern Africa.  Fenugreek is a
rectangle-shaped seed with a pleasantly bitter flavor.  Look for it in
Indian and Middle Eastern grocery stores.  I have used this marinade with
great success on tuna, pork tenderloin and sirloin steak.

* Juice of 1 lemon (1/4 cup)

Finely chop onion.  Mince garlic and ginger.  Place onions, garlic, ginger,
peppercorns, red pepper, coriander, cardamom, fenugreek, cinnamon, cloves,
allspice, salt and paprika in dry skillet and cook over medium heat 3 to 4
minutes, or until spices are lightly roasted and fragrant. Combine roasted
spice mixture, olive oil and lemon juice in blender and puree to smooth
paste.  Spread paste on meat and marinate overnight. WARNING: A little of
this spicy mixture goes a long way!

Makes enough marinade for 1 1/2 pounds tuna, pork tenderloin and sirloin
steak.

Bourbon & Honey Smoke-Roasted Pork Tenderloin

main dish, meats, marinade, seasonings

      ----MARINADE----
1 cup olive oil
1/2 cup bourbon
3 tablespoon honey
1/2 cup lemon juice
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 1/2 tablespoon fresh ginger root - peeled and grat; ed
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup thinly sliced onion
2 tablespoon fresh sage - coarsely chopped
2 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon salt
      ----MAIN DISH----
3  pork tenderloins
      ----GRILLING MATERIALS----
1  charcoal briquettes
6  wood chips (up to 8) - preferably f; ruitwood

Combine all marinade ingredients; blend well.  The marinade for this dish
can be prepared a day in advance; marinating should go on for 24 hours.

Lay the pork tenderloins in a ceramic or glass dish and pour marinade over
them.  Turn the tenderloins several times during the 24 hours that they are
marinating in the refrigerator.  When ready to cook, pat the pork dry.

Preheat charcoal in an outdoor grill and soak the wood chips in water for
30 minutes.  Add the chips to the hot coals. Roast the pork evenly for
about 40 minutes, until its internal temperature is 165 F. If pork is to be
eaten hot, allow it to sit on the edge of the grill for 10 minutes or so
after it is cooked so that the juices can be drawn back into the meat.

Good served either hot or cold, accompanied by a green tomato chutney.

Cajun Marinade(For Injection)

marinade

2 tablespoon hungarian paprika
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon black pepper
1 tablespoon white pepper
1 tablespoon granulated garlic
1 tablespoon ground passilla chile
2 teaspoon dry mustard
1 teaspoon roasted and ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1 1/2 tablespoon kosher salt
3 tablespoon cayenne pepper sauce
1 tablespoon worchestersire sauce
1/4 cup cider vinegar
12 oz chicken stock
12 oz beer

Place the dry ingredients in a clean coffee grinder and grind until very
fine. Place the liquid ingredients in a small saucepan and add the ground
dry ingredients. Bring to a boil. When it comes to a boil, remove from heat
and let cool completely . Using a syringe with a large needle, inject the
turkey every inch or so. Do this 24 hours before cooking. After 24 hours
you can cook >the turkey how you like, deep fried, smoked, roasted, etc. I
think the deep fry method is best suited for this marinade.

Carne Adobado ( Chile-Marinaded Pork )

pork

1 cup chile caribe
4 cup water
2 teaspoon salt
3  cloves garlic
2 tablespoon ground mexican oregano
2 tablespoon ground comino -- ( cumin )
5 lb pork loin chops -- thinly
1  sliced

Combine the Chile Caribe and water in  a blender ans whirl intul
mixed into a sauce. It will become somewhat thick, similar to ketchup
in consistancy. Add salt, garlic, oregano and comino to the sauce and
mix well. Trim the excess fat from the pork and lay slices flat in a
large baking dish. Cover with the sauce; turn the meat once to coat
evenly on both sides. Allow to marinate in the refrigerator
overnight. You can either cook this in the oven covered with aluminum
foil at 325 degrees for 30 minutes then uncover and bake another 30
minutes or grill over a fire with mesquite CHUNKS ( chips just burn
up, chunks give a much better flavor ) that have been soaked for
several hours in water. I prefer the grilling method. I also add a
touch of oil to the marinade and baste my pork loin with it when
grilling.  This makes great fajitas or just serve the meat as an
entree with rice and good beans.

Cascabel And Grapefruit Sauce

fruits, mexican, marinade

24  dried cascabel pepper see note
3 cup water
6  cloves garlic
4 cup fresh grapefruit juice
1 cup fresh orange juice
3 teaspoon allspice (jamaican)
1 teaspoon salt

: NOTE: Cascabel Peppers, this pepper is small (1 1/2 inch or so), round
and dark brown. This is the "little rattles" pepper that comes from the
Veracruz area. This pepper is not elongated, not black, not from South
America, and not real hot. Cascabel is also known as the chili bola.
: METHOD: Remove stem and seed from chiles. With a comal or black iron
skillet, or in an oven at 250 degrees, dry roast chiles for 3 to 4 minutes.
Shake once or twice and do not allow to blacken. Add to the water in a
covered pan and simmer very low for 20 minutes to rehydrate. Allow to cool.
SEE HINT. Taste the chile water, and if not bitter, add about 1/2 cup and
the chiles to a blender (use plain water if bitter). Puree together with
the garlic and strain. Add the fruit juices, allspice, and salt and mix
together. : HINT: If a very smooth sauce is required, pass the rehydrated,
coarsely chopped, chiles through a food mill, then proceed as above.

Coca-Cola Ribs

marinade, bbq

4 lb pork ribs
3 cup coca-cola or dr. pepper
3 cup ketchup
1 cup packed dark brown sugar
6 tablespoon chili powder
4 tablespoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoon dry mustard
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

Transfer the ribs to a large non-reactive glass or ceramic dish pour
2 cups of Coca-Cola or Dr. Pepper over them. Reserve the third cup of
the soda for a sauce to be made later. Let the ribs marinate, tightly
covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated, overnight.

About 6 1/2 hours before you plan to serve the ribs, start a fire in
your smoke/cooker and begin heating a quantity of coals. Then turn
your attention to the sauce.

Pour the remaining 1 cup of soda into a blender or food processor and
measure in the catsup, brown sugar, chili powder, pepper, dry
mustard, and cinnamon.  Mix until smooth and well blended. No need to
cook this one, as least for now.

Add some well-soaked aromatic wood such as hickory or mesquite to the
glowing coals in your cooker.  Set a pan filled with hot water in
place, and smoke cook the ribs, covered at 220 to 240 degrees F. for
about 3 hours.

After this initial smoking, turn the ribs, slather them with the
sauce, check the supply of wood and water in their respective pans,
and continue cooking for another 3 hours, this time turning the ribs
every 30 minutes and mopping them with sauce each time they're
turned. By the end of the 3 hours, they should have long since
reached the internal temperature of 160 to 170 degrees recommended
for pork.

After the last basting of the ribs, tote the remaining sauce inside
and simmer in a medium-size saucepan over low heat until quite thick.

Serve the gloriously gooey sauce in dipping bowls with the finished
ribs.

Cold Trout In Orange Marinade

seafood

3  trout (about 3/4 lb each),
1  gutted and scaled but with
1  heads and tails left on
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup flour, spread on a plate
2 tablespoon onion, chopped very fine
1 cup dry white italian vermouth
2 tablespoon chopped orange peel, using
1  only the rind, not the pith
1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange
1  juice
1  freshly squeezed juice of
1  one lemon
1  salt
1  freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 tablespoon chopped parsley

1.  Wash the gutted, scaled fish in cold water and pat thoroughly dry
with paper towels. 2. Put the oil in a skillet and turn on the
heat to medium.  When the
oil is hot, lightly dredge both sides of the fish in flour and
slip
into the skillet.  Don't overcrowd the pan; if all the fish does
not
fit loosely at one time, cook it in batches, dredging it in flour
only
at the moment you are ready to put it into the pan. 3. Brown the
fish well on one side, then turn it and do the other,
calculating about 5 minutes on the first side and
4    minutes on the
second.  Using a slotted spatula or spoon, transfer the fish when
browned to a deep serving dish broad or long enough to accommodate
all of it without overlapping.  Do not pour out the oil in the
skillet. 4. With a well-sharpened knife, make two or three
diagonal cuts on both
side of the fish.  be careful not to tear the skin, and avoid
cutting
into the flesh. 5. Put the chopped onion into the skillet that
still contains the oil in
which you cooked the fish.  Turn on the heat to medium and cook
the
onion until it becomes colored a pale gold. 6. Add the vermouth
and the orange peel.  Let the vermouth bubble gently
for about 30 seconds, stir, then add the orange juice, lemon
juice,
salt, and a few grindings of pepper.  Let everything bubble for
about
half a minute, stirring two or three times.  Add the chopped
parsley,
stir once or twice, then pour the entire contents of the skillet
over
the fish in the serving dish. 7. Allow the fish to steep in its
marinade at room temperature for at
least 6 hours before refrigerating.  Plan to serve the fish no
sooner
than the following day.  Do serve it within 3 days at the latest
to
enjoy its flavor at its freshest.  Take it out of the refrigerator
at least 2 hours before bringing to the table to allow it to come
to
room temperature.  Before serving, garnish it, if you like, with
fresh slices of orange. ~--

Dry Rub Spice Marinade

marinade, herbs

1/4 cup kosher salt
2 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon dried thyme
2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup granulated or brown sugar
2 tablespoon paprika
2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Combine all ingredients, blending thoroughly. If reserving for later use,
store in a tightly capped jar. To use, sprinkle heavily over all sides of
meat and rub in well with fingers. Let meat stand at room temperature for
two hours, or lightly covered overnight in the refrigerator. Sprinkle meat
again lightly before grilling, broiling or baking. This recipe makes enough
for 3-4 pounds spareribs. Mixture is also good on poultry.

Keeps indefinitely in tightly capped jar. Note from the cook:"The secret of
a good dry rub is equal proportions of kosher salt and sugar. The salt
draws juices to the surface of the meat; the sugar drinks those juices up,
making a lovely, light, potently seasoned glaze on the meat.These are the
herb bottles closest to my hands, if you have other stuff handy, add it as
you wish: ground ginger, or dry mustard; red pepper flakes, or onion
powder. Customize it any way you will." Via: RFIX_S 09-28-1994

Fish Marinated In Herbed Olive Oil

fish, marinade

4  garlic cloves; peeled and
1  ; crushed
1  fresh rosmary; handful
1  ; removed from stems
1  fresh oregano; handful
1  ; removed from stems
1  italian parsely; handful
1  black pepper; fresh ground
1  fresh fish filets or steaks
1  ; (thick halibut or salmon
1  ; best)
2 cup olive oil
1  salt garnish
1  lemon wedges

Place the garlic, rosemary, oregano, parsley and black pepper in a food
processor and chop coarsely.  Rub both sides of desired fish and place in a
glass baking dish. (Do not add any salt or acids such as lemon juice or
vinegar at this time!)  Add the oil and turn the fish a couple of times.
The fish should be nearly or completely submerged in the oil. For best
results, the fish should be covered and refrigated overnight. You may also
marinate it for a few hours.

To cook, pat off the excess oil and lightly salt to taste. Grill, broil, or
bake to your liking.  Do not over cook! Serve with lemon wedges. The
leftover herbed oil can be refrigerated for a few day and reused only for
fresh seafood preparation.

SAGER To: ALL Subject: PIZZA Flags:

Hi, thought maybe someone out there would like either of my recipes.

Roast Beef Bar - B - Q  Pizza :

I always use Robin Hood pizza dough mix or you can use your regular dough
recipe for the crust.
You'll need 1# of Roast Beef, cut it into small pieces then pour 1 bottle
of B-B-Q sauce into the meat. After you have the meat well coated then
spread the mixture onto your pizza crust. You can use whatever cheese you
like the most, I always use Mozzarella on mine.

Pierogie Pizza:
1. Your favorite pizza crust
2. A mixture of mashed potatoes (I've always used homemade, never tried
powder yet)
3. Small can of sauerkraut
4. Mozzarella and cheddar cheese (I sometimes use 3 cups of cheese
depending on how much of the potato mix you put on your pizza.)

Use your mixer to mix the sauerkraut into the mashed potatoes.  Then
spread onto your crust and then add cheese.  You can put as much potatoe
mix as you want on the pizza just becareful when you cut it the potato mix
will be very hot!

I hope you enjoy them!!!

Flavored Vinegars

marinade, sauces, salsas

1  flavorings -- such as
1  sprig fresh herbs
1  peppercorns
1  fresh chilies
1  clove garlic
1  vinegar -- such as
1  white- or red-wine
1  cider
1  champagne
1  sherry -- or
1  rice-wine vinegar

Vinegars keep for up to a year. Use good-quality red-wine or white-wine
vinegar or cider, sherry, champagne or rice-wine vinegar. For vinegar
containers, I like to recycle attractive bottles. They must be in excellent
condition, free of chips and cracks.

Sterilize the bottles before using: Wash with hot soapy water and rinse
well. Place on a wire rack in a large pot and add water to cover the
bottles; bring to a boil and let boil for 15 minutes.

Transfer the bottles to a clean towel, then use a chopstick or skewer to
poke desired flavorings into sterilized bottles.  Experiment with different
combinations and amounts.  Addvinegar to fill, using a funnel. Seal tightly
with clean new corks, plastic

degrees. Then remove the chicken from the sauce and place on rack
above a paper lined sheet tray. Return to oven and cook until chicken
has a dry like appearance. Then baste with sauce and return to oven.
Repeat this step until sauce is used up.  When half the sauce is used
try a wing and see if it is the flavor you want.  (This half way
point will smack your mouth and finish with a mild slow burn.  This
is what I call "red fire" appearance.) If wanting the real thing
continue until sauce is gone. The ckicken will have what I call a"
black fire" appearance.  This point in the process will grab your
lips and attempt to rip them off and then finish off with a pleasant
medium hot slow burn. Enjoy it.

You may want to try marinating them in the sauce overnight then
cooking off.  It could only get better doing them this way.
Note-11-15-96 I tried it marinating over night and it gives a full
deeper flavor. It didn't seem to be as hot this way.  I like both
ways.

This was in the making over a 5 1/2 year period.  This is it the real
thing.  Hot chicken wings without the buffalo. This is a limited
edition of wings; one taste and you will limit who you give them to
or eat all of them yourself.

Please do enjoy them and share them.

Jamaican Ribs Or Chicken

marinade, chicken, bbq, ribs

1  ribs  or 1 chicken cut up
3/4 cup onions; chopped
4 large garlic; minced
1  peppers see directions
2 tablespoon allspice
1 tablespoon vinegar
2 tablespoon salad oil
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon salt
12  bay leaf soaked in hot water

PEPPERS: You can control the heat with the type of peppers you use. Between
the marinade and the cooking, a lot of the heat will be lost, so dont be
afraid to throw a couple of whatever hot peppers you have on hand. I use 2
large cayennes, 2-4 chilies, and a token jalapeno. The preperation: combine
everything except the bay leafs and the meat in a large zip lock ba Add
meat and thouroughly mix. Let marinate in the fridge at least 2 hours
preferably until the next day. Fire up the bbq. Remove meat fromthe bag
wiuth as much as the marinade as possible still clinging to it. Place half
of the bay leafs on the meat. Dum the remaining marinade or use it as
insect repellant. Cook very slowly over medium heat turning often. If your
grill has a vented hood close it . Do no let meat burn. Cover and cook
about 1/2 hour. After 1/2 hour remove the bay leaf, turn meat, place the
remaining bay leav on the meat and cook till done (About 1/2-3/4 hours more
depending on the heat). Eat. Break out the beer. You'll need it.

Jerk Paste

marinade, bbq, caribbean

1  onion; finely chopped
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 cup finely chopped scallions
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
6  habanero chiles
2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon allspice

Recipe by: romero@minerva.cis.yale.edu (C. Antonio Romero) From:
rec.food.cooking. Since there were numerous requests in my mailbox today
for the jerk recipe, I thought I'd just go ahead and post it.

I started with recipes from "Jerk: Barbecue from Jamaica" by Helen
Willinsky-- which seems to be a reasonable cookbook, though I haven't tried
many of their recipes beyond the jerk marinades and jerk chicken. I've made
some modifications of my own which I'll note as I go.

Jerk seasoning can be made two ways: one is a marinade, one is a paste
(more authentic, sez Willinsky) Mix all ingredients to form a paste (use a
food processor).

The recipe as I have been doing it lately uses dried habaneros (all I could
find around here) and instead of the onion, a cup to a cup and a half of
scallions including the bottom part (I think I used two bunches of six
not-very-large scallions each; trim the little roots and the scraggly bit
at the top of the stalk). Looks and smells just like the Jamaican Country
Style jerk in the bottle. I also add a little soy sauce for color, and a
generous shot of cream sherry-- seems to go well in the paste; I think the
sweetness works well with the allspice.

Jalapenos cannot be substituted-- the result will be MILD, I kid you not (I
learned this the hard way the first time I tried to make jerk chicken for
guests and couldn't get habaneros).

Jim's Teriyaki Marinade & Bbq Sauce

marinade, sauces, bbq, japanese

1 cup soy sauce
1 cup water
2 tablespoon vinegar
2 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1/2 teaspoon powdered ginger
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce, opt'l
2 tablespoon corn starch

Whisk together all the ingredients except the corn starch. Marinade the
meat long enough to flavor and tenderize- 1 hr for young chicken breasts or
fish, overnight for round steak and up to 5 days for some game cuts.

BBQ and baste with the marinade. Make a slurry of the starch and a little
water and whisk into the marinade. Bring to a boil, stirring as the sauce
thickens. Serve with the BBQ'd meat.

Real garlic and ginger only improves this dish. The amount of pepper sauce
can be varied from mild to fiery. You can substitute wine, sherry, orange

Jollie Ollie's Marinade For All Meats

marinade, sauces

1  ***juices***
2  lemons; juice of
2  oranges; juice of
1  grapefruit; juice of
1  cherry juice to taste
1  dill pickle juice; to taste
1/2 oz worcestershire sauce
1/2 oz teriyaki sauce
1 tablespoon mustard
1 tablespoon ketchup
1  ****spices***
1 pinch tarragon
1 pinch thyme
1 pinch sweet basil
1 pinch sage
1 pinch coriander
1 pinch mace
10  fennel seeds
1 pinch rosemary
1 pinch oregano
1 pinch cumin
1 pinch chervil

Put juices into mixer and add spices.  Mix till a bit foamy. Then taste, if
too tart, use honey to make it almost sweet. It should be slightly tart.

Now put cut up meat and marinade in marinade pan and let stand in room temp
for an hour.  Then put in refrigerator overnight.

When ready to cook, I use the broiler, or make shish kabobs. But I really
like it broiled in all the juice. At this point of cooking when meat is not
pink I usually add a bit of honey over the meat so that the broiler just
cooks it a bit more.

Now with mashed potatoes and asparagus spears it's a meal fit for a king.
The left over juice and meat (if there is any left) I generally heat in the
microwave till hot, then pour it into a plate and just sop up the juice
with buttered bread and just the meat, no potatoes or veggies. It tastes
even better when it's reheated, because all the juices and spices have had
a chance to marry into a fantastic taste extraordinaire.

Kathy Pitts' Brisket

marinade, beef

3 lb brisket, trimmed of almost all fat; and silvery covering
3 tablespoon liquid smoke marinade
1  (we used figaro's)
3 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
1  serrano pepper, seeded
1  and cut into fine slivers
3  the white part of 2-3 green onions,; cut into fine slivers
1  lots of paprika, lemon
1  pepper for a barbecue rub

Marinate the brisket in a mixture of the liquid smoke and Worcestershire
sauce for 2-3 hours.  Remove from the marinade, and cut slits all over the
exterior of the meat.  Insert slivers of onion and serrano pepper in the
slits.

Cover the brisket with a VERY liberal coating of paprika and lemon pepper.
Wrap securely in heavy duty aluminum foil (use a drug-store wrap to prevent
leakage).

Place the brisket in an ovenproof rimmed dish (we used our trusty cast iron
skillet) and place in a preheated 250 degree (F) oven for at least 16
hours.

After the first 12-14 hours, you may unwrap the brisket briefly, and ladle
out some of the accumulated juices for use in your own homemade barbecue
sauce.

Lemon & Thyme Marinade

poultry, marinade, french

2 tablespoon strained fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, or 3/4 tsp dri; ed, crumbled
2 tablespoon olive oil or vegetable oil

This is a tangy marinade, containing equal amounts of lemon juice and
oil, and is good for rich meats like chicken thighs. It can be used
for chicken breasts too, but their skin should be on for additional
protection during grilling or broiling.  Thyme gives this marinade a
flavor loved in France, but you can substitute oregano for an Italian
or Greek accent, or mint or cilantro for a Lebanese touch.

Mix ingredients in a small bowl.

Makes about 1/4 cup, enough for about 1 1/2 to 2 lbs poultry.

Lemon-Herb Chicken

marinade, chicken, bbq

2 1/2 lb chickens,cut into serving pieces,wa; shed and patted dry
1/2 cup fresh lemon juice,about 4 small lem; ons
1 cup olive oil
4  garlic cloves,crushed
1 teaspoon onion salt
1 teaspoon paprika
3 tablespoon fresh rosemary or thyme or 1 tbsp.; dried

Freshly ground black pepper,to taste Garnish: lemon peel strips,optional

Place chicken pieces in a glass or ceramic bowl. Mix marinade ingredients
until smooth and well blended. Reserve 1/3 cup, covered and refrigerated,
for basting while grilling. Pour remaining marinade over chicken, turning
pieces to coat completely. Marinade, covered for 6 to 8 hours or overnight,
turning occasionally. Remove chicken from refrigerator 20 to 30 minutes
before you are ready to grill, leaving container covered. When coals are
covered with gray ash, oil the grill rack. Cook chicken, skin side down
first, for about 15 minutes on each side, brushing with the reserved
marinade. Watch carefully, as uncovered grills will cook the exteriors
faster than a covered grill. Pieces are done when exterior is golden brown
and clear juices run when the chicken is pierced with a sharp fork. Discard
any unused marinade. Garnish with strips of lemon peel, if desired. Total
cooking time 30 minutes.

Marinade & Basting Sauce For Brisket Of Beef

3 cup dry red wine
3 teaspoon salt
1 cup olive or peanut oil
3 tablespoon poupon mustard

2 tablespoon prepared horseradish
2 teaspoon onion powder
3 tablespoon lime juice
1 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper

Mix all of the ingredients really well and then pour over whole beef
brisket.  Let marinate for several hours, or overnight if possible. Also,
use this marinade as a basting sauce. Some people may find Justin's 3 cups
of dry red wine a little bit too much for their taste. No problem, use as
much as you like in the sauce, and drink the rest. Sure won't go to waste.

1/4 teaspoon powdered bay leaf
1 teaspoon salt

1  juice of 1 lemon

Mix all the ingredients together thoroughly. Pour the mixture over the
meat, chicken or fish to be marinated and allow to steep for 2 hrs.,
turning occasionally. Then grill meat, and,if desired,slice thin and
serve on garlic bread. Below is another recipe. Just a quickie, but
quite good. I don't have amounts for everything. Just use your
judgement accdng to how much meat you have. Soy sauce; a little red
wine (optional); a bunch of garlic powder, and onion powder. Marinate
at least one hour, turning once. >>> Grill and do same as with other
marinade to serve. These two recipes are the only way we will eat
steak. We are in cold climate in fall and winter, so we don't get to
grill all year, but if we could, we would!! E N J O Y P.S. The red
wine in the second recipe also helps tenderize the meat, in addition
to adding flavor. FROM: DONNA HARTMAN (HDDW83B)

1/2 cup sherry vinegar
1/2 cup wine; red or white
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 each garlic cloves; sliced
2 tablespoon freshly chopped herbs
1 single red peppercorns; if desired
1 teaspoon sugar

"... Ingredients in a marinade can be varied, but it is important to use
wine, vinegar, lemon juice, or some acidic liquid to break down the
connective tissues.  This process will make the steak more tender.
Remaining marinade ingredients add flavor." Use a good-quality olive oil or
walnut oil; add good-quality wine or vinegar and a combination of fresh and
dried herbs, seasonings, garlic and soy sauce to make a flavorful marinade.
1.  Place all ingredients in glass screw-top jar; shake vigorously. Arrange
meat in shallow glass dish; pierce with a fork. Pour marinade over meat;
turn to coat. Cover and refrigerate several hours or overnight, turning
meat occasionally. 2.  Remove meat from marinade; pat dry. Remove any
pieces of spices or herbs that may stick to meat. This recipe is a steak
marinade, but the ingredients can be adapted for other meats using the same
techniques.

carrots,  add to the marinade with a little salt and pepper. Leave for at
least 12 hours turning occasionally. Peel the remaining onions and carrots,

1 1/2 lb jicama (1 lg. or 2 small)
1 large sweet orange,cut into wedges
      ----MARINADE----
3 tablespoon orange juice
2 tablespoon grapefruit juice
2 tablespoon lemon or lime juice
1 teaspoon finely grated grapefruit or orange; rind
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh coriander or 2; tsp. ground

SOURCE:  Marinades Make Ordinary Foods Extraordinary by Dona Z. Meilach,
copyright 1995, ISBN #1-55867-119-66. MM format by Ursula R. Taylor.
Peel jicama with a sharp knife or potato peeler and cut it into 1/2 inch
cubes.  Mix marinade, pour over jicama and refrigerate, covered, for at
least 1 hour. Arrange on a platter and garnish with orange wedtes. Makes 8
to 10 servings.
NOTE:  Jicama (say Hick-ama) is a bulbous root that looks like a turnip
and is indigenous to Mexico, sometimes called Mexican potato. It is
becoming more and more popular in the United States. The root is peeled to
reveal a white crunchy flexh that is sweet and slightly nutty in flavor. It
is good both raw and cooked. Laft as is, it makes a perfect addition to a
raw vegetable platter presented with a dipping sauce. This recipe gives it
a special flavor.

Presented by: Zarella Martinez, L.A. Times article, "Home Ground",
10/6/94, page H16. "The ricado used in this dish is the basis for many
Yucatan peninsula dishes. The most famous is cochinita pibil; a suckling
pig, marinated with this spice paste and wrapped in banana leaves, baked in
a Mayan earth oven called a pib. Large fish and venison or other wild game
are also baked in pibs. I slather this paste on guinea hens and broil them
on the rotisserie, or wrap marinated chicken breasts or fish fillets in
banana leaves with slices of orange and steam the packets. One of my
favorite appetizers is chicken drummettes baked with this recado.
"... Quintana Roo oregano comes from a tree, not a shrub, and the long
leaves turn black when they dry. Mexican oregano can be substituted for
it."

Salt-Roasted Chicken With Marinade

chicken, chinese

1  roasting chicken, 4 1/2 to 5 lbs.
1 large piece caul fat or cheesecloth soake; d in oil
5 lb to 6 lb coarse (kosher) salt or roc; k salt
      ----MARINADE----
3 slice fresh ginger root
3  whole garlic cloves, lightly crushe; d
3  whole scallions, cut into 3-inch se; ctions
1 tablespoon peanut oil
1 tablespoon bean sauce
2 tablespoon thin soy sauce
1 tablespoon shaoxing wine or dry sherry
1 tablespoon sugar
1  whole star anise
1 teaspoon whole sichuan peppercorns, roasted
1/4 cup chicken broth
8  whole stems chinese parsley

Method: Salt-roasting

[This marinade can also be used on roasted duck. S.C.]

Fill the chicken with the marinade, skewer it shut, and allow it to
dry for 1 1/2 hours.

1.  Wrap the chicken in a large piece of caul fat or cheesecloth
soaked in oil.

2.  Heat the salt in a pot [heavy Dutch oven, big wok or whatever can
take the heat.  S.C.] on top of the stove over a low flame or in the
oven at 350F for at least 1 hour. Pour off some of the salt, leaving
just enough to cover the bottom of the pot.  Lay the chicken on top
of the salt in the pot and cover it with the remaining salt. Cover
the pot and bake the chicken for 1 1/2 hours.

3.  Remove the chicken from the salt.

4.  Pull off the salt that remains caked on the chicken. Be careful,
because the salt is hot.

5.  With a paper towel, wipe away the remaining salt. (The salt in
the pot can be reused.)

6.  Peel off the caul fat, drain the marinade, and cut the chicken
into bite-size pieces.

Serves 4 to 6 as a main course.

May be served hot or cold; if cold, the chicken may be prepared up to
a day in advance.  (Do not reheat.)

Suggested beverage: Pinot Noir or Burgundy

From "Chinese Technique" by Ken Hom with Harvey Steiman. Simon and
Schuster, New York.  1981.

This is a good "guest" food.  You can appear to have mastered esoteric
Oriental cooking techniques without ever having actually prepared the
dish before... Unless you drop the pot on the kitchen floor and set
it on fire with the hot salt, it's a pretty foolproof cooking
technique.

I'd serve this two recipe with hot mustard, a bowl of hoisin sauce,
Chinkiang vinegar, spiced salt and a bowl of chopped green onions for
dipping along with some sweet Chinese pickles and lots of ice-cold
Oriental beer.  Heaven!  (And rice, of course.)

Sate Babi - Pork Satay

marinade, pork, barbecue

2 lb pork filet or
1  boned pork loin
1 medium onion; rough chop
1 each clove garlic
1 teaspoon fresh ginger; chop
3 tablespoon tamarind liquid =or=
3 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoon dark soy sauce
1 tablespoon sambal ulek =or=
2 each fresh red chile; seed & chop
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon palm sugar =or=
1 teaspoon dark brown sugar
2 tablespoon peanut oil

Soak bamboo skewers in water for a few hours before threading meat on them
for grilling.  This helps prevent the ends of the skewers burning.

Ask butcher to remove rind from pork loin.  Cut pork into small cubes about
3/4 inch square.  Put onion, garlic, ginger, tamarind liquid, soy sauce,
sambal ulek or chiles, salt and sugar into blender container and blend
until smooth.  Pour into a bowl, stir in oil, then add cubed pork and stir
until all the pieces are well coated with marinade. Leave for at least one
hour or longer in the refrigerator.

Thread on skewers 5 or 6 pieces, not pushed too close together and leaving
a few inches on end of skewer for holding.  Leaving space between pieces
enables them to cook more evenly, and pork must be well cooked. Grill over
glowing coals or under preheated griller for 6 or 7 minutes on each side or
until pork is well cooked through and brown on all sides. Do not put too
close to source of heat or outside will be brown before pork is cooked
through.

Sate Manis - Sweet Satay

meats, marinade, sauces

1 1/2 lb filet or rump steak,  or pork fille; t
1 tablespoon palm sugar =or=
1 tablespoon dark brown sugar
1 each clove garlic; crushed
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon dark soy sauce
1 tablespoon oil
1 teaspoon ground cumin
      ----SATAY SAUCE----
1/2 cup peanut sauce (saus kacang)
2 tablespoon tamarind liquid =or=
2 tablespoon lemon juice
2 teaspoon sambal bajak
3 tablespoon to 4 water

Cut beef or pork into 3/4 inch cubes.  Thread 4-5 cubes on each bamboo
skewer, not pushing them too close together.  If skewers have been soaked
in cold water for an hour or so beforehand, it prevents them burning when
satay is cooked.  Combine sugar with garlic, salt, soy sauce, oil and
cumin.  Stir until sugar dissolves.  Pour into a long shallow dish and put
satay in the marinade, turning each one so the marinade coats the meat.
Cover and refrigerate for a few hours.

Cook over glowing coals or under a hot grill for approximately 15 minutes,
not too close to the source of heat for pork must be well done; even beef
is always well cooked, never rare, in satay.  Turn skewers every 5 minutes,
and brush with marinade.  Serve hot accompanied with satay sauce.

Satay Sauce: Combine all ingredients and serve in a bowl. The sauce is
spooned over the satay before eating.

Sherry Marinade

poultry, marinade, pork, beef

1/2 cup cream sherry*
1/2 cup soy sauce
1 cup water
1/3 cup honey
2  garlic cloves, minced
1 pinch red pepper flakes, optional

Combine all ingredients until well blended.  Before add to the meat, stir
well to be sure honey is combined with other ingredients and has not
settled to bottom.  Its a good idea to stir while marinating for the same
reason.  Yield:  2 cups.

*To substitute dry sherry for cream sherry, increase the honey to 1/2 cup.

Simple Marinade

meats, condiments

1 tablespoon soy sauce (dark)
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon oil
1  garlic clove

Crush the garlic and mix all ingredients together.  Add meat (steak) and
leave for at least 1 hour, the longer the better.

NOTES:

*  A simple and quite superb meat marinade -- This is a truly wonderful
marinade.  Just take the steak out of the freezer in the morning before you
go to work and pop it in the marinade. Yield: 1 serving .

*  The recipe calls for 1 clove of garlic, but we often use 2 or more. Be
careful with the Soy Sauce, if it is too salty the marinade is not so good.
This basic mixture can be varied infinitely; particularly, you can use more
marinade than this for one piece of meat. I like to use sesame oil, or
mustard oil for a little "bite" instead of a bland vegetable oil.

: Difficulty:  easy.

Smoked Barbequed Turkey

poultry, marinade

1 each turkey, 8-10 lbs
1/2 cup salt
1/2 cup sugar
1 quart apple juice
1 tablespoon rosemary
1 tablespoon basil
1 each honey, for basting

Place turkey in brine for 8-12 hours.  Remove from brine.  Rinse well and
air dry.  Place turkey in the smoker with both upper and lower cavities
open to expose the insides to smoke.  Smoke 3-3 1/2 hours or longer being
careful not to dry bird out.

Remove turkey from the smoker and cook in your favorite way.  If you desire
more smoke flavor, simply increase smoking time and the amount of fuel
used.  Reduce your cooking time by 10% for each hour in the smoker (up to
40%).

If you are using a smoker/barbeque/roaster type of barbeque, switch modes
to roast mode and baste the turkey with honey during the roasting time.

Sun-Dried Tomato And Roasted Garlic Pesto

pasta, poultry, marinade, sauces, spreads

1  whole head
3 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1 cup sun-dried tomatoes (see
1  note)
1/3 cup fresh flat-leaf (italian)
1  parsley sprigs
2 tablespoon chopped garlic chives or
1  scallion tops
2 tablespoon unsalted pistachios or pine
1  nuts
2 tablespoon freshly grated parmesan
1  cheese
1  garlic

Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Slice the top off the head of garlic and place
the garlic in a small baking dish. Rub it with 2 teaspoons of the olive
oil. Bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until soft. Allow to cool, then squeeze the
garlic puree from its papery wrapper into a blender container or the bowl
of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Add tomatoes, parsley,
garlic chives (or scallion tops) and nuts. Process until finely minced. Add
remaining oil (2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon) and cheese, and process until
blended. Transfer to a small bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and
refrigerate. Keeps a week or longer. Serve on toasted Italian bread, on
pasta, spooned on frittatas, or with chili, enchiladas or tamales. Note:
Dried tomatoes are available in several styles: moist, like dried apricots;
brittle and dark-red; and packed in olive oil. Moist-style are preferred
here. If you can only find the brittle type, soak them in warm water for a
few minutes before using or place in a bowl, cover with water, and heat in
microwave from 30 to 60 seconds. Yield: 1 cup.

Tabaka (Cinnamon-Orange Marinade)

marinade, russian

3  oranges
1  lemon
2  limes
2  cloves garlic (2 t.)
1  inch piece fresh ginger
1 medium onion
2  cinnamon sticks
3 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste
1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/4 cup dry white wine
3 tablespoon vegetable oil

Source: FOODday, July 9, '91 From: Valerie Whittle

This cinnamon-orange marinade, characteristic of Balkan cooking, is a
specialty of Georgia in south-central Russia.  The tabaka marinade is
usually used with chicken and game hen, but it also goes nicely with
swordfish.

Remove zest of 1 orange and the lemon.  (This is best done using a
vegetable peeler.  Be sure to take only the zest, not bitter white pith
beneath it.)  Juice oranges, lemon and limes.  Combine juice and zest in
bowl. Peel and mince garlic and ginger root. Finely chop onion. Add garlic,
ginger and onion to citrus juices along with cinnamon, paprika, sugar,
salt, black pepper, nutmeg, wine and oil.  Whisk to mix. Makes enough
marinade for 1 1/2 pounds chicken, game hens and swordfish.

Tarragon Lamb

main dish, meats, marinade

4 lb leg of lamb
2/3 cup cream
1 teaspoon tarragon
1 1/4 cup dry white wine
1 tablespoon oil
1 single salt and pepper to taste
1 each onion sliced

Skin  the  leg of lamb and trim away all the outside fat and as much of the
fat lying between the muscle tissue that you can reach. Score the flesh
deeply with a criss-cross pattern and stuff the slits with the tarragon.
Rub the meat with the oil and cover with the onion. Place in a suitable
dish for marinating and pour over the white wine. Add a little salt and
pepper and leave to marinate for about 2 hours in a cool place, basting
occasionally.  Roast the lamb with the marinade, basting it frequently, in
a warm oven 325 deg F until done.
About 10 minutes before the meat is cooked,  pour off the marinade and
meat juices into a saucepan. Reduce the gravy to half its original quantity
by  boiling vigorously. Carve the meat into thin slices and add the
resulting juices to the marinade. Arrange the meat on a serving dish and
keep warm.   Remove the gravy from the heat, stir in cream and carefully
re- heat the sauce until it forms a medium-thick consistency. Pour the
sauce over the lamb and keep warm.

Thanksgiving Turkey Marinade - Dkp

poultry, marinade, holidays

1  see recipe

Thaw turkey (if frozen) on Monday & Tuesday in refrigerator.

On Wednesday, put 3 onions (cut up), 4 garlic cloves (sliced) and 1 large
bunch of parsley in cavity of bird.

Pour Vernors (ginger ale) and 8 oz orange juice concentrate in cavity.
Cover and rub bird with Catalina dressing. Sprinkle with seasoned salt and
pepper and paprika.  I put the whole mess in a garbage bag and marinate it
overnight.

Before baking, discard all marinade.

Di Note:  When I finally bought my house, I wanted to have Thanksgiving
here instead of at my mother's (which was traditional). I had NEVER done a
turkey before. I bought this HUGE creature and started to do the marinade
thing (my Mom's recipe).  Well, I don't have much counter space and this
bird was a slipping an' sliding all over the place and I was laughing
hysterically.  I was actually fighting this monster! My Mom called to see
how everything was going and all she could hear was me cackeling. She
jumped in her car and came over and here I was, on the floor with this damn
bird in my lap and marinade all over me. It was one of those
moments...great marinade tho!

The Gabor Sister's Goulash Soup

soups, marinade, celebrity

2 medium sized onions, minced
3 tablespoon fat
1 lb lean beef, cubed
1 teaspoon paprika
6 cup light soup stock
2 large carrots, sliced
4 medium sized potatoes, cubed
1 large tomato, quartered
1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds
2  sprigs parsley
1  salt and pepper to taste
1  bay leaf
1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley or dill
1/2 teaspoon sweet paprika

Mince onions and saute in fat until light golden; do ot let them brown. Set
aside. In the same skillet, add cubed beef and brown lightly on all sides.
Add paprika and blend well. Heat soup stock and add browned beef and
onions. Cover tightly and cook gently over medium heat until meat is
fork-tender, about 2 hours. Then add all the vegetables, caraway seeds, and
parsley sprigs. Season with salt and pepper. Add bay leaf. Cover and simmer
gently over low heat until the vegetables are tender. Discard parsley
sprigs and bay leaf. Sprinkle with minced fresh parsley or dill. Prepare
your favorite dumplings; add them to soup about 15 minutes before serving.
NOTE from Jolie: The popularity of Goulash in the Hungarian home is well
known. By the addition of more meat cubes this hearty Goulash Soup may be
served as a main dish. You may vary the flavor by adding favorite
seasonings. Gutes aus Ungarn means Something Good from Hungary and Scharf
means HOT (as in spicy). I have a Hungarian Goulash Soup recipe for you by
Jolie Gabor (yes, the Gabor sisters' mother) <G> I haven't personally tried
this recipe, but am posting it here for your perusal... Enjoy! Rita in

Ton-Yuk-Kui (Korean Pork Or Beef) *** Xpst31a

main dish, marinade, ethnic

12 teaspoon pork; tenderloin, slices
1 single marinade:
1/2 cup soy sauce,
1/4 cup water,
3 tablespoon sugar,
2 each green onion; -- scallions, c
2 cup garlic; crushed
2 pinch ginger; chopped,
1 single salt & pepper.

Preparation: Combine the meat with the marinade and allow the mixture to
soak for about 2 hours at room temperature, Stir occasionally to make sure
all of the meat gets well coated. Then take the meat from the marinade and
dry on paper towels.  Be sure to save the marinade. Coat the sides and
bottom of a baking dish with 2 or 3 Tbs. of Sesame oil and arrange to pork
in the dish so there is only one layer of the meat.
Bake in a  pre  heated oven (375 F) for 50 minutes until the meat is
tender. While the meat is bak- ing take the marinade and in a sauce pan
bring to a boil.
When boiling  re- duce the heat to low and cook for approx 15 minutes. The
amount should be a little reduced. When the meat is finished baking pour
its cooking juices into the reduced marinade and bring the liquid to a boil
again. Put the meat on a serving dish and pour some of the hot liquid over
the pork. The remain- der of the hot liquid can be served seperately for
those who wish  to  have more  liquid on their meat or as a gravy on their
rice.

1/2 tablespoon mustard (any creamy kind)
1  salt & pepper to taste
1/2 cup cooking oil

1/4 cup bottled french dressing
1  onion salt to taste
1  garlic salt to taste
1  meat tenderizer 1/2 t per lb of mea; t

Mix well. Marinate meat for a minimum of four hours.

Here is the absolute best meat marinade I have ever had...I found it in
"Delicious Decisions" the cookbook of the Jr. League of San Diego. I find
that very, very inexpensive London Broil (even bottom round & shoulder) is
almost butter tender when marinaded in this overnight then grilled
(although broiling is almost as good). Slice thin across the grain & you'll
surely impress guests! From goober273@aol.com Sat Apr 20 05:07:26 1996
