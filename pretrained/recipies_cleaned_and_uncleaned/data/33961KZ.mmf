      Title: WILD RICE CASSEROLE
 Categories: Main dish, Side dish, Digest
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 c  Wild rice, uncooked
      1 lb Fresh mushrooms, sliced
           -thickly
      1 c  Minced onion
      3 c  Vegetable broth
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
 
  Rinse wild rice well.  Combine wild rice, mushrooms, onion, and
  garlic in a 3 quart casserole dish. Pour broth over it all, cover,
  and bake at 350 degrees for about 1 1/2 hours.
  
  I use the "jumbo domestic Canadian" wild rice for the best results,
  but any wild rice will taste good.  I usually stir after an hour of
  baking. The liquid is absorbed all at once toward the end, don't
  panic! I add a teaspoon of salt when entertaining SAD eaters, and
  often increase the amount of onion and garlic when my husband and I
  are eating alone.
  
  I am a wild rice fanatic and mail order mine from a place in
  Minnesota. I can e-mail the address to anyone who is interested.

 Categories: Vegetarian, Rice
      Yield: 4 Servings

      2 tb Egg replacer (or arrowroot)
  1 1/2 c  Water
      1 c  Soy milk
      1 ts Salt
      4 tb Oil
      2 c  Flour
    1/2    Garbanzo flour

MMMMM--------------------------STUFFING-------------------------------
    3/4 c  Wild rice, uncooked
  2 3/4 c  Stock
    1/4 md Onion; minced
      2 sm Stalks celery; sliced thin
      2 tb Unrefined corn oil
    3/4 md Onion; chopped coarse
    1/4 lb Button mushrooms
           - sliced thick
      6    Shiitake
           - fresh or reconstitued,
           - quartered or eighthed
    1/2    Oyster mushrooms
           -OR- chanrerelles mushrooms
           -If using oysters, separate
           -them into small clumps,
           -if using chanterelles,
           -halve them
      1 lg Tomato; chopped
    1/2 ts Powdered sage
      1 pn Powdered thyme
      1 tb Shoyu
           Salt and pepper; to taste

MMMMM---------------------NUTTY ALMOND SAUCE--------------------------
      3 tb Unrefined corn oil
           -OR- soy margarine
      4 tb Unbleached flour
  2 1/2 c  Soy milk; heated
    1/2 c  Almonds
    1/4 md Onion; separated into leaves
      4    Cloves
           White pepper; to taste
      3 ds Freshly grated nutmeg
           Salt; to taste
 
  FOR CREPES: Blend the egg replacer w/1/2C water until smooth. Add
  remaining ingredients and blend one minute at high speed.
  
  Heat a crepe pan or non stick 8" skillet over low heat, brush the
  bottom lightly w/oil (I use unrefined corn oil). When pan is heated,
  take it off the burner, let cool about three seconds and pour 3-4T
  batter into it. Swirl the pan so the bottom is coated w/a thin layer
  of batter. Put the pan back on the burner and cook until lightly
  browned. Flip the crepe and cook until that side is lightly browned
  as well. Repeat w/remaining batter. This makes about a dozen crepes.
  Note that you will inevitably screw up the first crepe or two, but it
  will become fairly routine after that. Don't worry about it, I still
  do that after all these years.
  
  FOR STUFFING: Saute the onion in a little dry white wine for a minute
  or two, then add wild rice and stock, cover tightly, bring to a boil,
  turn heat to low and cook about an hour, until all liquid is absorbed.
  
  While the rice cooks, saute celery in oil until slightly tender, add
  onions and all mushrooms, and saute until all vegs are medium tender.
  Add cooked rice, tomato and seasoning and cook another ten minutes or
  so. Fill crepes w/the mixture, roll them over it and heat in a
  preheated oven at 350 for about ten minutes.
  
  Serve w/Nutty Almond Sauce and garnish w/parsley and a twisted orange
  slice.
  
  FOR NUTTY ALMOND SAUCE: Toast almonds until golden, then pulverize.
  (Don't overgrind or you'll get almond butter.)
  
  Heat oil a few minutes in a heavy bottomed skillet, then stir in
  flour and cook 2-3 minutes on low, until fragrant. Stir in soy milk
  and continue to stir until it begins to thicken, then stir in
  seasonings. Cover and cook 10 more minutes, but stir often to prevent
  scorching. Stir in almonds and cook another 4-5 minutes.
  
  Serve w/a simple spinach salad w/mustard vinaigrette and French bread,
  along w/a chilled white wine.

      Title: WILD RICE WITH CHESTNUTS
 Categories: Vegetarian, Rice
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 tb Oil
      5 md Shallots
           - peeled and finely chopped
      2    Celery ribs; finely chopped
      1 c  Wild rice; rinsed
    1/3 c  Dried, peeled chestnuts
    1/4 c  Dried currants
      2 ts Aniseed
    1/4 ts Sea salt; or to taste
      4 c  Water
      1 ts Finely chopped orange zest
           -OR- grated
 
  PRESSURE COOKER: Heat the oil in the cooker.  Add the shallots and
  celery and cook, stirring frequently, until softened slightly, about
  1 minute. Stir in the rice, chestnuts, currants, aniseed, salt, and
  water.
  
  Lock the lid in place and over high heat bring to high pressure.
  Lower the heat just enough to maintain high pressure and cook for 25
  minutes. Allow the pressure to come down naturally or use a quick
  release method. Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow any
  excess steam to escape. If the rice or chestnuts are not quite
  cooked, return to high pressure for a few minutes.
  
  Drain (reserving the liquid for stock) and return to the pot. Cover
  and let steam over low heat for a few minutes to dry out. Fluff up as
  you stir in the orange peel. Break up chestnuts into 2 to 3 pieces
  with a fork, if desired.
  
  STANDARD STOVETOP: Soak the chestnuts overnight. Drain and reserve the
  water.  In a heavy 2-quart saucepan, heat the oil. Add the shallots
  and celery and saute for 1 minute. Add the chestnut soaking liqiud
  plus enough water to equal 3 cups and bring to a boil. Stir in the
  rice, reserved chestnuts, currants, aniseed, and salt. Return to the
  boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer until most of the grains have
  butterflied and almost all the liquid has been absorbed, about 50
  minutes. Let stand, covered, off heat for 10 minutes.  If there is
  still liquid left in the bottom of the pot, lift out the rice with a
  slotted spoon.

 Categories: Low, Fat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Wild rice, rinsed
      3 c  Water
      3    Cucumbers, sliced thick and
        sl Cut into quarters
      1    Red bell pepper, diced
      1 bn Green onions (or 1 Vidalia
           Or red onion), chopped
 
  (the cucumbers can be increased with good results, and other
  veg.added) Bring the water to a boil, add the wild rice. Return to
  boil, turn down to simmer for 40 minutes or until some of the grains
  burst. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Drain any excess water.
  Toss cooled rice and other ingredients in a bowl.
  
  You may use any dressing you like, but I like to use one of these:
  
  Basil/Balsamic Vinegar Dressing [T] - I think I derived this from
  something McDougall
  
  1/3 c balsamic vinegar 1 T soy sauce 2 T water 2 T fresh basil,
  chopped fine 2 cloves garlic, chopped fine 1 T onion, chopped fine
  1/2 t black pepper
  
  Combine in a jar, shake, and allow to sit, preferably overnight. The
  salad will also be improved if it is dressed and allowed to sit for
  several hours, which is good, since there is a lot of it!
  
  The other dressing I use on this is from the New McDougall Cookbook,
  called the Savory Salad Dressing. [T]
  
  1 t Dijon mustard 1/4 c red wine vinegar 1/4 c water
      1/4 c  soy sauce dash Tobasco sauce
  
  Combine in jar, shake, allow to sit for a few hours.
  
  (makes a LARGE amount, keeps well)

           Fresh baby spinach leaves
 
  Drain can of salmon, reserving the juice. Break fish into large
  pieces. Set aside.
  
  Mix together the spinach and 75g / 3oz of the flour. Beat the egg and
  milk and add gradually to the flour. Beat well to remove lumps.
  Season with salt.
  
  Heat a drop of oil in a crepe or frying pan. Put 2-3 tablespoons of
  pancake batter into the pan and rotate gently to spread evenly. Cook
  over a moderate heat until the pancake begins to lift. Turn over to
  cook other side. Repeat until the batter is used up. Keep crepes warm.
  
  Melt the butter in a saucepan, stir in the flour then gradually add
  the juice from the salmon and the milk. Stir briskly to prevent lumps.
  
  Add the salmon to the sauce with the mushrooms, seasoning and yogurt.
  Heat through. Put salmon filling onto each pancake and fold into
  triangles. Arrange on a serving plate. Keep warm. Heat the walnut oil
  in a pan and quickly fry the remaining mushrooms. Garnish the
  pancakes with mushrooms, lettuce and spinach leaves.

      Title: WILD WILD DINNER (WILD RICE/WILD MUSHROOMS)
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 c  Wild rice (I like Lungren's
           Mix)
      2 c  Fresh wild mushrooms,
           Chopped
      1 md Onion, diced
      2 c  Mushroom/vege broth
        x  Balsamic vinegar
 
  ~ put rice, liquid into a covered casserole dish and place in oven at
  around 300 F.
  
  ~ preheat a pan, add balsamic and immediately added diced onions.
  
  ~ after around 10 minutes add mushrooms to onions, turn flame to
  lowest setting
  
  ~ when the liquid in the oven boils turn oven down to 250. When it's
  around 3/4 absorbed (around 45 minutes), stir in mushroom and onions.
  
  ~ when liquid is fully absorbed turn off oven, fluff rice, and put in
  oven partially uncovered for another
       15    minutes.
  
  Serve with green vegetables like broccoli. This tastes especially
  good with some chopped walnuts added!
  
  (Mushroom broth is the liquid that comes out of meaty mushrooms when
  you dry-sautee them.  I.e. put it in a pan and heat with no added
  liquid. As the liquid comes out of the mushroom, pour it off and
  save.)
  
  I used horse mushrooms (relative of the button) and some rehydrated
  Boletes.  Of course you could do this with brown rice, domesticated
  mushrooms as well..

      Title: WILD YEAST SOURDOUGH
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
           Text Only
 
  The Chef or Starter (Based by Thorne on the method of Lionel Poilane)
  
  1. Pour one-half cup of (unchlorinated) water into a bowl. Work in
  enough flour to make a "moist but cohering dough." Prac- tice will
  make this stage obvious: when the soupy slurry turns to a solid,
  puttylike mass that can be massaged (kneaded) into a small, elastic
  ball. Please note that no commercial yeast has been added. This
  starter will ferment, if it does ferment, be- cause of the presence,
  either in the ambient air or in the flour, of naturally occurring
  yeasts and symbiotic bacteria.
  
  2. Put the starter in a small bowl. Cover with a damp dish towel
  secured by a rubber band. Leave on a shelf in a draft-free kitchen
  for three days, re-moistening the towel as needed (and when possible:
  clearly, the atmosphere in your kitchen may dry out the towel so
  rapidly that only round-the clock surveillance will really keep the
  towel continually moist. Eternal vigilance is impossible, but do your
  best. Also please note that no kitchen temperature is specified,
  since you will probably have to work with what you've got. Unheated
  kitchens in severe winter weather are obviously not the ideal, but
  the normal range of temperature in a modern home should work in
  something like the times speci- fied here and below).
  
  3. The starter is activated when it looks and smells active.
  Fermentation produces a noticeable expansion in its size and a
  slightly "tangy" odor. It can then be used or refrigerated for
  several days.
  
  The Levain, or Sponge: 8-ounce starter, 2 1/2 cups flour,
  
  Put the starter in a bowl with 1 1/4 cups cold water (cold to slow the
  fermentation, on the theory that a long rising at this point improves
  flavor and. be cause it relaxes the gluten, makes the job of working
  in the water easier). Work until the starter has completely
  dissolved. (Thorne uses his hands: an electric hand beater is it much
  more efficient. Just add a little water at a time.) Stir in the flour
  and the salt to make a loose mass. With floured hands move it to a
  clean bowl. Cover with a damp towel and a piece of plastic wrap.
  Secure with a rubber band and leave to ripen overnight in a cool
  place (Thorne specifies 60 degrees).
  
  The Loaf: 1 sponge, Flour, Cornmeal
  
  1. Put the sponge on a well-floured surface. Begin to work in the new
  flour. The idea is to knead in as much flour as the sponge will "take"
  until it turns into silken, nonsticky dough that is a pleasure to
  work. No amount of flour is specified. The limiting factor is the 1
  1/4 cups of water added at the sponge stage. This kneading stage
  takes 12 to 15 minutes, during which the movement activates the
  elasticity of the gluten and traps air in the dough so that the yeast
  can do its work.
  
  2. Dust the dough with flour, put it in a large, lightly oiled bowl,
  cover with a damp towel and let rise to double in bulk. This is a
  fairly fast rise and needs a warm environment, around 80 degrees, for
  one to three hours, usually about two.
  
  3. Flour your hands and gently rework the dough to break up air
  bubbles. Pinch off an egg-shaped piece of the dough and reserve as
  the starter for subsequent adventures. Line a colander with a
  generously floured towel, and secure it around the colan- der's
  perimeter with a rubber band. Set the dough on the towel and let rise
  almost as far as it did on the first rise.
  
  4. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Heat the base of the bread cloche.
  
  5. When the dough is ready, sprinkle the cloche base liber- ally with
  corn meal. Then, grasping the towel, pick up the loaf, and roll it
  gently onto the cloche base so that the round part faces up. Slash
  the surface in three places with a sharp knife or single edged razor
  blade. Place in oven, cover with cloche top, and bake for 15 minutes.
  
  6. Reduce heat to 400 degrees and bake another 20 minutes. Then
  remove the cloche top to brown the crust for about 10 minutes. The
  loaf is done if it sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. After it
  cools, store in a closed paper bag.
  
  Yield: One crusty loaf.

      Title: WILD-PLUM KETCHUP
 Categories: Other sauce
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     10 lb Plums; stemmed
     10 c  Sugar
      1 qt White vinegar
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
    1/2 ts Ground cloves
 
  Makes 8 pints.
  
  The recipe came from the "Preserving" volume of the Time-Life Series,
  _The
  
  This recipe is taken from the Presbyterian Cook Book, compiled by the
  ladies of the First Presbyterian Church, Dayton, Ohio. Wild plums are
  a native American fruit, found in most eastern and central states.
  They ripen in August and September.  Tart cultivated plums may be
  substituted [My note:  a la Banana Ketchup I added rum for the "wild"
  plum part!}
  
  Add the sugar to the plums (I did it in layers; the first couple
  layers at the bottom of the pot, I slashed the plums so they would
  leak a bit faster and not caramelize the sugar), and place over
  medium heat. Cover. After 30 minutes, increase the heat and stir the
  plum-sugar mixture. Break some of the plums with a wooden spoon (my
  note: this is important. Boiling sugar is very very hot; a wooden
  spoon will stay cool whereas a metal utensil may heat up).
  
  Continue cooking, stirring the mixture occasionally so that it does
  not stick to the pan.  In approximately 15 minutes, all of the plums
  will be cooked through and mashed (my note: especially if you mash
  'em as you stir).
  
  Mash the mixture with a wooden spoon.  Put the mashed pulp through a
  fine sieve, and continue mashing until all of the liquid and some of
  the pulp go through (I used a food mill, ulp--different string, and I
  used all the pulp).  Discard the pits and the skins.  They should be
  about 4 quarts (4 liters) of liquid.  Boil the vinegar together with
  the spices for a few minutes.  Add the vinegar-spice mixture to the
  plum liquid, then boil vigorously, stirring constantly for 15
  minutes, or until the liquid had reduced to 4 quarts again. Pour into
  bottles or jars. Process. (Louis Szathmary, _American Gastronomy_).

      Title: WILDFOWL STOCK
 Categories: Game, Poultry, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 3 Quarts
 
      3 qt Cold water
      5 lb Game bird carcass, wings,
           -legs, neck, other spare
           -parts
      2    Or 3 stalks wild celery,
           -cut in chunks
    1/2 c  Wild onions, chopped
    1/2 c  Wild carrots, chopped
      1 sm Bunch watercress
 
  Place cold water in a soup pot.  Place game bird pieces in cold
  water. Soak for 1 hour.  Add other ingredients. Do not stir. Soak for
  1 hour. Place pot, uncovered, at the back of a cook stove far from
  the fire. On a conventional stove, place the pot on an asbestos pad
  over very low heat.
  
  Allow pot and it's contents to warm very slowly.  You need to draw as
  much as possible out of the ingredients and into the stock. Skim off
  scum as it rises.  When the pot is uniformly warm, move it closer to
  the fire (or increase the heat) and very slowly and carefully bring
  the liquid to a simmer.  Do not boil. Do not rush. Skim off all the
  scum immediately, as it rises within the first 30 minutes of
  simmering.  After 30 minutes and after skimming, use a clean piece of
  cheesecloth to wipe the pot at the level of the liquid.
  
  Simmer very gently, uncovered, for at least 3 hours.
  
  Taking great care not to disturb the ingredients, carefully ladle the
  liquid through clean, moistened cheesecloth into a large screw-lid
  jar. Do not pour the stock. Leave the unstrained stock uncovered
  until cool. Cover cooled stock tightly and store in refrigerator. Do
  not remove grease at this time.
  
  Skim grease from stock.  Reheat for use, or freeze.
  
  This is from the cookbook on wild foods.  I've copied as it's written
  because I found the style of writing and ingredients interesting. If
  you try to use wild ingredients, be careful. I seem to remember that
  both wild onions and wild carrots have close relatives that look much
  the same but are toxic.  Personally, I'd do my stalking at the
  supermarket.

      Title: WILLIAM WIGHT'S CHIPOTLE CHILES
 Categories: Sides
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Jalapeno peppers
 
  I made my first batch of chipotles two weekends ago and they tasted
  great. My Mexican-American friends at work gave them a positive
  thumbs up.
  
  How I did it:
  
  Preparing the smoker:
  
  I borrowed my neighbors Cajun Cooker II water smoker (borrowing is
  much better than buying).  His unit has two grills, one near the top
  and one just above the water pan. I put 5 lbs of self-lighting
  briquettes in the bottom, and set them on fire.  I put 3 qts. of cold
  water in the water pan that sits above the charchol pan. I bought a 3
  lb. bag of mesquite wood chips and soaked them in water while the
  briquettes got going.
  
  Preparing the Meat:
  
  I bought a fresh whole pork loin, cut it in half and rubbed it with a
  smoker spice recipe (will post if anyone wants it) did the same with
  two fresh turkey legs. I put the meat on the bottom shelf.
  
  Preparing the chiles:
  
  I picked them in my garden the morning of the smoking. About half of
  the chiles were red. I washed them and cut off the tops, at the
  calyx. I put about 2 lbs of standard Jalapenos and TAM Jalapeno
  (50:50) about two peppers thick on the top shelf of the smoker.  I
  prepared a second simmialr-sized batch of Jalapas and Fresno chiles
  for the second batch.
  
  The Smoking:
  
  When the briquettes got going, I started to put a few mesquite chips
  on the charchole.  About every 15 minutes I had to add more mesquite
  as the smoke would stop when the mesquite was consumed. I did the
  first batch of chiles for 3 1/5 hours and removed them.  I added the
  second batch.
  
  At 8 hours (4 1/2 for the second batch of chiles) I took out the
  chiles and meat.  The pork loin was just about the best pork I've
  ever eaten and my wife said the turkey leg was for sure the best
  she'd ever had.
  
  After dinner, I put all the smoked chiles on two foil-lined cookie
  tray and put them in the oven set at the lowest setting. I left them
  in the oven to dry for about 24 hours. I tested the chiles until they
  were crisp and would break when I squeezed one.  I let them cool and
  put them into my blender and chopped them to fine flakes/powder.
  Beware of the powder, it'll make you cough big time!  I them blended
  them all together and was surprised how little I ended up with, about
  3/4 qt.
  
  My powdered chipotles have a very rich smokey flavor and are mildly
  hot. So far, I have used them on tacos and I tried them sprinkled on
  top of cream cheese spread on crackers. Wow, what a taste. I just
  hope the bottle of powdered chipotles will last me until next season.

      Title: WILLIE'S CRISP
 Categories: Desserts, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 9 Servings
 
      1 c  Flour
      1 c  Sugar
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
      1    Egg, beaten
      5    To 6 cups peeled, seeded,
           -sliced fruit, or stemmed
           -berries
    1/2    To 3/4 cup sugar
      2 tb Flour
    1/4 lb Butter, melted
 
  I love cobblers, crisps, etc., but never make them. This one may
  change my mind.  What can you say about a recipe that starts like
  this?
  
  "...When I called her, she read me the recipe from a small black cook
  that contains, she says, the recipes that have no peer, the benchmark
  recipes. Willie's Crisp is part of this collection, and although I
  have no idea who Willie is, I do know that his is the only crisp I've
  ever had that was crisp. It is perfect on top of fruit or berries."
  
  Preheat the oven to 375F. Have ready an 8 x 8-inch baking dish (no
  need to butter it). Put 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, the baking powder
  and salt in a large mixing bowl. Stir to mix well. Make a well in the
  center of the dry ingredients and add the beaten egg. (Don't add the
  egg now unless you are going to bake this right away. The sugar will
  begin to melt, and the mixture won't crumble and spread properly.)
  Stir mixture with a fork. It should be crumbly; if it seems too dry,
  add a little more egg. Put the fruit or berries into another mixing
  bowl. Stir together the 2 tablespoons flour and sugar to taste. Add
  to the fruit and toss lightly to coat. Spoon fruit into the baking
  dish and spread evenly. Sprinkle the crisp mixture evenly over the
  top. Drizzle the melted butter evenly over the crisp mixture. Bake
  for about 40 minutes, or until the topping is golden. Serve warm with
  whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
  
  Serves 9.

      Title: WILTON MARSHMALLOW CREAM FLOW-IN
 Categories: Desserts, Cakes, Frostings, Wilton
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1    Jar marshmallow cream for
           -each color desired
           Icing color
 
  This stays very shiny and is easy to cut through. These decorations
  will not dry hard as Wilton color-flow & must be done directly on the
  cake or cookie.  CAUTION - Marshmallow cream will be VERY HOT. TO
  PREPARE MARSHMALLOW CREAM - Pan Method: Place about 1 1/2" water in a
  large skillet or electric pan.  Depending upon design,  set up to
  four jars of marshmallow cream (one for each color) into pan and
  bring water to a boil. For faster heating, fill jars only halfway.
  Add icing color as the cream softens, stir until color is well
  blended. Let simmer, then stir until cream is smooth.  Leave jars in
  water while you decorate. Microwave Method: Place the desired amount
  of marshmallow cream in a bowl. Add desired past color.  Microwave on
  high power for about 10 to 12 seconds, then stir. If not softened
  (the total time depends on quantity being heated) microwave again for
  7 to 8 seconds more. After heating, stir until color is completely
  blended. TO DECORATE: Trace pattern on cake with a toothpick. Outline
  design with stiffened buttercream or royal icing (royal is preferred
  as the heat of the marshmallow cream may soften buttercream) and tip
  3. Let outlines dry for 10 minutes or more. Cut a very small opening
  in the end of a parchment bag and fill with marshmallow cream.
  "Flow-in" by filling in along the edges of the outline first,
  squeezing gently and letting the icing flow up to the outline almost
  by itself. Work quickly; filling in design from the outside edges in
  and from top to bottom. If you're working with a large area, have 2
  parchment bags ready so it won't set up before you're done.  If the
  marshmallow starts cooling and won't flow smoothly, simply microwave
  bags for about 7 to 8 seconds on high power.  Any remaining cream can
  be stored in a jar & reused by microwaving for 8-9 seconds until soft.

      1 ts Easy-blend yeast
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 oz Melted lard
    1/4 pt Warm water (or milk & water)

MMMMM-------------------------TO FINISH------------------------------
    1/4 lb Pure pork lard; diced
           Lard for greasing the pan
           Cinnamon
           Allspice
           Demerara sugar

MMMMM-----------------MIX TOGETHER THE FOLLOWING----------------------
      1 oz Sultanas; chopped
      1 oz Raisins; chopped
      1 oz Currents; chopped
      1 oz Chopped candied peel
 
  Using a food-mixer or processor or your hands, mix and knead the
  dough. Cover it with oiled polythene and leave to rise until doubled
  in size; this will take about 1 hour in a warm place.
  
  Knock back the dough, knead it again briefly and roll out to an
  oblong. Mix together 1-1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon
  ground allspice and 2 ounces sugar and sprinkle half of this mixture
  over the dough. Add half the dried fruits and half the diced lard.
  Roll up the dough, like a swiss roll, give it a quarter turn and roll
  it out to an oblong again. Sprinkle with sugar and spices, dried
  fruits and fat exactly as before. Then roll up and roll out the dough
  to an oblong once again, but this time make it the right size to fit
  a shallow baking or roasting tin about 7-inches square. Grease the
  tin and put the dough into it, pressing it well into the corners.
  Cover and leave to prove (rise) until the dough is light, puffy and
  well risen.
  
  Score the top of the dough with a diamond pattern, brush with melted
  lard and sprinkle on 1 ounce of sugar. Bake at 425 F (220 C) gas mark
  7 until cooked to a golden brown and smelling delicious, 35-40
  minutes.
  
  Cool the cake briefly in the tin so that the melted fat is
  re-absorbed, then serve it while still warm, cut into large sticky
  fingers. Makes 1 cake

      Title: WILTSHIRE WHITSUN CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Desserts, Ethnic
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
    3/4 lb Sm. tart green gooseberries
      5    Elderflower blossoms*
    1/2 lb Plain wholemeal flour
      2 ts Baking powder
      2 lg Eggs
      6 oz Butter
      6 oz Pale muscovado sugar
           Demerara sugar
           Flowers & leaves to garnish
 
  *Note: A handful of sweet geranium or lemon balm leaves may be
  substitued for elderflower blossoms if desired.
  
  Top and tail the gooseberries into a mixing bowl.  Add the finely
  chopped leaves or the florets of elderflower carefully stripped from
  the stalk, and stir to mix with the fruit.  Sift the flour and baking
  powder into a separate bowl.  Cut then rub in the butter. Stir in the
  muscovado sugar then the lightly beaten eggs. Finally, stir in the
  gooseberries and their flavourings.
  
  Grease the base of an 8-inch spring-clip cake tin, line and grease
  again. Turn the cake mixture into it and mound it up in the middle.
  Bake at 350 F (180 C) gas mark 4 for about 1 1/2 hours. Unlike most
  cakes, this one does not come away from the sides of the tin when it
  is cooked.
  
  Cool for a few minutes before unmoulding.  Sprinkle with demerara
  sugar and decorate with fresh elder blossom or sweet geranium or
  melissa leaves, and serve the deliciously moist cake while it is
  still warm - as a pudding, with plenty of cream.

 Categories: Ron's, British, Desserts, Fruits
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Butter for greasing
     40 g  Long grain rice
    350 ml Milk
    450 g  Cooking apples
    1/2    Lemon rind grated
     50 g  Caster sugar
      3    Egg whites
 
  The House of Windsor is the correct name for the family our present
  Queen Elizabeth II belongs to. This dish was created especially for
  her and can now be enjoyed by all of you.
  
  An exceptionally light pudding which is difficult to turn out of its
  cooking dish.  For this reason I would always cook and serve it in
  the same dish. Placing a small circle of greaseproof/cooking
  parchment in the base of the dish can assist in its extraction.
  
  You will also need a saucepan big enough to contain the pudding basin
  or or souffle dish, with lid in place.
  
  Grease a 1 litre pudding basin or souffle dish.  Place the rice in a
  pan with the milk and cook until tender and all milk is absorbed.
  Allow to cool a little.
  
  Peel, core, and roughly chop the apples.  Stew until soft shaking the
  pan from time to time in order that the apple does not stick. In the
  meantime, half fill a large pan with water and bring to the boil.
  
  Place apple and grated rind of 1/2 lemon in a blender and puree. Stir
  in cooked rice and sugar.
  
  Whisk the egg whites in a clean, dry, bowl until they form fairly
  stiff peaks.  Stir the egg into the apple mix. Spoon it all into the
  prepared basin or dish. Cover with greasproof/parchment paper or
  foil, and tie with string. Stand the basin/dish in the pan of boiling
  water, after first placing an old plate in the base. The basin/dish
  should stand on the plate, and the water should come about half way
  up the basin/dish. Put on a tightly fitting lid and steam gently for
  around 45 minutes. Serve hot! From Ron's Plaice in Blackpool:)

 Categories: Alcohol, Beverages
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 oz Wine
      5 oz Lemon-lime soft drink (e.g.,
           -7-UP, Sprite, Slice)
           Ice cubes  (opt.)
 
  Mix wine and soft drink. Pour into 8 oz glass. Add ice. (750 ml wine
  to 2 liter soft drink = 8 wine coolers you buy.)
  
  This recipe makes wine coolers very similar to the ones you buy.
   I usually use a cheap wine with lots of berry flavor.

      Title: WINE COOLERS
 Categories: Boat, Drinks, Alcohol
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Wine
           Fruit punch
           Soda water
           Ice
 
  Buy some white wine that you like.  I like Italian Sparkling wines,
  they are sweet and are already carbonated so you can make a stronger
  cooler by cutting back on the water. Find two or three fruits you
  like and squeeze out the juice. Add this juice to the wine and stir
  it up. Pour in to cooler or suitable container already full of ice.
  pour in the carbonated water and stir slowly.  Garnish with chunks of
  fruit. Keep a lid on it to keep out the flies and keep in the
  carbonation. BTW a real sangaree combines wine, brandy and water. Try
  substituting a schnapps or brandy for the juice for a cooler with
  more kick. Pretty basic stuff but its classier than Bartles and
  Jaymes and you can make your own flavors like strawberry banana,
  watermelon lime and so on.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
        3 TB olive oil
        3 lb cubed lean stewing beef, --
  :          such as brisket or tri-tip
    1 1/2 c  diced carrots
    1 1/2 c  sliced onions
        2 TB chopped garlic
      1/2 c  diced celery
        5 c  peeled and diced raw beets
        2 c  seeded and diced tomatoes
        8 c  rich beef stock
        3 c  dry red wine
    1 1/2 ts fennel seed
        2 ts thyme leaves (or 1 teaspoon
  :          dried)
        2 TB balsamic vinegar
  :          Kosher salt and freshly
  :          ground black pepper
      1/4 c  finely chopped fresh
  :          parsley
    1 1/2 c  diced red potatoes
    2 1/2 c  finely shredded green
  :          cabbage
        1 ts caraway seed
    1 1/2 lb roasted and peeled beets, --
  :          cut into 1/4-inch dice
  :          Garnish: Sour cream
  
  In a stockpot, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Add the beef in
  batches and quickly brown on all sides. Remove the meat and reserve.
  Add the carrots, onions, garlic and celery. Saute until the
  vegetables are lightly colored. Return the beef to the pot and add
  the raw beets, tomatoes, stock, wine, fennel seed and thyme. Bring to
  a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer partially covered for 1 1/2 to 2
  hours or until the beef is very tender. Occasionally skim off the fat
  as the borscht simmers.
  
  Strain the soup carefully, pressing down gently on the meat and
  vegetables to extract as much liquid as possible. Set aside the beef
  cubes and discard the remaining vegetables, if desired. Return the
  beef and strained liquid to the stockpot. (The soup can be made ahead
  to this point and refrigerated overnight.) Add the balsamic vinegar
  and salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the parsley and keep warm.
  
  In a separate saucepan, in lightly salted boiling water, blanch the
  potatoes until just tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and keep warm. In a
  medium saute pan, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add the
  cabbage and caraway seed. Saute until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.
  
  To serve, ladle the borscht into warm soup bowls. Add the roasted
  beets, potatoes and sauteed cabbage. Garnish with a dollop of sour
  cream.

 Categories: Jams
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
      2 c  Wine
      3 c  Sugar
      3 oz Liquid pectin (1 pouch)
 
  I (the Frugal Gourmet Cooks With Wine) use a flavorful wine. You can
  use port or sherry for a sweeter jelly, but I prefer a Zinfancel,
  Gamay Beaujolais, or perhaps a Chardonnay. A Fume Blanc is nice as
  well. Stir the sugar into the wine and warm, in a stainless steel
  pan, until the sugar is dissolved.  Do not overheat. It must not
  quite come to the simmer. Remove from the heat and stir in the
  pectin, being very careful to dissolve the pectin completely in the
  wine and sugar mixture. Pour into small jars. I use 8-ounce jelly
  jars. Keep refrigerated. It will keep about 2 months. Makes about 4
  cups.

      Title: WINE JELLY SANS GELATIN
 Categories: Digest, Dec.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 3/4 c  Wine
      3 c  Sugar (Vegans, try
           Succanat )
      1    3 ounce pouch liquid
           Pectin
 
  Prepare 4 half-pint canning jars or jelly glasses. (Wash, and leave
  in hot water.  Wash lids if necessary, and place in boiling water.
  Leave in hot water until ready.)
  
  Mix wind and sugar in top of a double boiler.  Place over boiling
  water; stir
  
  until sugar is completely dissolved (circa 5 minutes). Remove from
  heat, but leave mix over hot water.  Stir in pactin all at once. If
  foam forms, skim off with a metal spoon.
  
  Leave the jelly to set one minutes, skim off the foam. Pour jelly
  quickly into hot jars, filling to 1/8" of the top. Carefully wipe off
  rim of jar. Put lid on each jar as it is filled, screwing ring
  tightly.
  
  [At this point, Sunset says to let cool.  I'd process in a water bath
  for 5 minutes.  In a bath (a stockpot or huge saucepan), set up a
  small rack and fill with enough water to cover the filled jars, with
  about an inch of water.  Hint:  if you boil your jars to sterilize
  them, use the water bath for both purposes. Hint2: Pressure cookers
  make good water baths for small runs. ]
  
  [Still on water bath:  Put jars into boiling water, and start timer
  when water gets batck to boiling. Hold for 5 minutes, then pull out.]
  
  (if you stay with the Sunset approach, invert the jars to finish
  sterilizing the lids.  You'll avoid any mold.)
  
  Place jars on a towel *away from drafts* and let cool. Should keep
  almost forever until opened.
  
  [Note:  Jelly recipes leave little room for variation. Do not double,
  and don't play with the proportions of sugar/wine. Lastly, find the
  right pectin.  It matters. I have several pints of cranapple syrup
  that were supposed to be jelly to remind me of these facts...

      1    12 1/2 Oz. C  Lemonade
           Concentrate -- [frozen]
     12    Whole Fresh Limes
      9 oz Lime Mix Powder -- Tang or
           Bar mix
      7 oz Triple Sec
 
  Combine water, limeade concentrate, lime powder and juice squeezed
  from limes.  Stir briskly until dissolved. Add wine and Triple Sec,
  cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.  To create
  a frothy marguerita combine the whites from 2 eggs with 6 servings of
  the marguerita and whip in a blender for 2 or 3 minutes. [yes, the
  recipe does say to put in the egg whites.  Is this safe?  What else
  could be substituted to make a froth ?  Just buzz in the blender with
  ice chips?]
  
  Makes 20 servings.

      Title: WINE TART
 Categories: Desserts, Bakery
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
    140 g  Plain flour (5 oz)
      1 ts Baking powder
     60 g  Unsalted butter (2 1/4 oz)
      1 ds Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
      3 tb Milk
           Butter and flour for the
           - tart tin

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
    120 g  Caster sugar (4 oz)
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
     10 g  Plain flour (1/4 oz)
    100 ml Good dry white wine (scant
           - 1/4 pint)
     15 g  Butter (approx. 1/2 oz)
 
  This a recipe from the Swiss district "Vaud": both the pastry and the
  filling are local specialities.
  
  Pre-heat the oven to 260 oC/500 oF. Lightly butter a tart tin with a
  removable base 20 cm (8 in) in diameter.
  
  Pastry: put the flour, baking powder and softened butter together in a
  large bowl. Add the salt and sugar. Rub all the ingredients together
  with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse semolina. Add
  the milk and mix it in lightly and rapidly with your fingers, without
  exerting any pressure. Form the pastry into a ball, using it to
  collect all the loose flour. If need be, add another drop or two of
  milk.
  
  Do not let the pastry rest, but roll it out straight away to fit the
  prepared tart tin. The pastry should be only 3 mm (1/8 in) thick and
  should extend well beyond the rim. Ease the pastry into the base of
  the tin by pressing gently into the corners with a small ball of
  dough, but arrange for the spare pastry at the top of the tin to
  project as a little horizontal fold or lip about 1 cm (3/8 in) wide
  and 1 cm deep inside the tin. There is now much less spare pastry all
  round the outside of the tin. Press the pastry down on top of the rim
  with your thumb and trim it off neatly by rolling the pin across the
  tin.
  
  Press the fold of pastry inside the tin upwards (the rolling pin
  should have passed over it without touching it at all). Work fast,
  with your fingers inside the rim. You now have a border standing up
  all round the top of the tin, with the lower, outside edge firmly
  attached to the rim. Pinch this border between your finger and thumb
  with tweaking movements, at intervals of 1 cm (3/8 in) to make a
  little fluted edge all round the top of the tart.
  
  Mix the sugar, cinnamon and flour together. Strew this mixture all
  over the bottom of the tart. (This is a liquid filling so the bottom
  of the tart is not pricked with a fork). Pour the wine over the sugar
  mixture and mix it with your fingertips. Dot the surface with the
  butter, in flakes.
  
  Cook the tart in the bottom of the pre-heated oven for 15 ... 20
  minutes, turning it from time to time to equalise the heat and to
  prevent bubbles forming.
  
  Leave the tart to cool before taking it out of the tin.

  Cook the tart in the bottom of the pre-heated oven for 15 to 25
  minutes, turning it from time to time to equalise the heat and to
  prevent bubbles forming (at the end of the cooking time, the filling
  must look like "middle-firm" gelatin).
  
  Leave the tart to cool before taking it out of the tin.

  mixture resembles coarse meal. Slowly stir in enough of the water to
  form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball. Divide the
  dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured surface or
  pastry cloth, roll into a rectangle no thicker than 1/8 inch thick.
  With a sharp knife, cut the dough into 2-inch squares. Place on a

 Categories: Game, Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      8    Quail, skinned and trimmed
           -of fat
    1/4 c  All-purpose white flour
           Salt and freshly ground
           -black pepper to taste
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Dry white wine
      2    Ripe tomatoes, peeled,
           -seeded and finely chopped
      4 ts Chopped fresh sage
 
  This sophisticated dish is deceptively simple to prepare. Two Cornish
  game hens may be substituted for the quail. Skin and halve them
  before cooking, and braise them for 35 to 40 minutes.
  
  Tie quad legs together and tuck the wing tips under the bird. Combine
  flour, 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper in a shallow dish. Dredge the
  quail in the flour mixture. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet let
  over medium-high heat and brown the birds well on all sides, for 5 to
  6 minutes. Pour off any fat.
  
  Add wine, tomatoes and sage, and boil for 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat
  to low, cover and cook, turning occasionally, until the birds are
  tender and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. Remove the birds
  to a warm platter.
  
  Boil the sauce over medium-high heat until it thickens and is slightly
  reduced, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and
  nap the quail with the sauce.

    1/4 c  Distilled white vinegar
      1 tb Lemon juice
    3/4 c  White wine
 
  Stem and seed the habaneros, leaving the inner membranes. Combine the
  habaneros with all the other ingredients except the lemon juice and
  wine in a blender and process to a fine puree. Transfer to a
  nonreactive pan and cook over low-medium heat for ten minutes. Add
  lemon juice and wine, mix well and transfer to sterilized sauce
  bottles. Keep refrigerated, shake well before use.
  
  I found that this sauce improves over time, apparently as the wine
  turns into vinegar.

      Title: WINED CHICKEN IN DELUXE GRAVY
 Categories: Chicken, Oriental, Poultry, Meats, Wok
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Fryer (3-4 pound in weight)
      1 lg Onion, cut into wedges
      1 c  Fresh mushrooms, sliced
           -OR
    1/2 c  Canned mushrooms
    1/2 c  Celery, sliced
           -OR
      1    Celery stalk, sliced
    1/2 c  Water chestnuts, sliced
      4 tb Oil
    1/4 c  Soya sauce
    1/4 c  Wine
  1 1/2 tb Corn starch, dissolved in
    1/3 c  Water
 
  1. Take your Chinese cleaver and chop through bone of chicken to form
  chunks of chicken, about 2x2". Marinate all chicken chunks in wine,
  soya sauce, salt for at least 20 minutes. In the meantime, slice all
  the other ingredients and have ready for cooking.
  
  2. If your wok is small, you will have to divide your chicken into 2
  batches and cook each batch seperately. If your wok is large enough
  to hold all the chicken, then place 4 tablespoons oil in it, heat to
  smoking point, add all of the chicken and onions to it, stir fry and
  brown chicken on all sides with wok uncovered. This will take about
  10 minutes. At the end of this period, cover wok and cook chicken a
  further 10 minutes.
  
  3. Uncover wok, add clery, mushrooms, water chestnuts, stir everything
  well. Cover wok and cook ingredients 3 minutes, uncovering wok, once
  to give things a stir. Mix starch solution up well, add to wok, stir
  everything up thoroughly.
  
  NOTE: If your wok is small, cook the chicken in two batches. Remove
  both batches of chicken to a serving platter. Leave chicken juices in
  wok. Cook vegetables and make gravy in it. When vegetables and gravy
  are cooked, pour over chicken. This dish can be used as a main dish
  in Canadian cuisine, by not cutting up the chicken so fine.

      Title: WINTER SQUASH & FRUIT
 Categories: Digest, Jan.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Peeled winter squash
      1 lg Yam
    1/2 c  Dried fruit
      1    Apple
      1    Pear
      1    Banana
    1/2 c  Cider
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Allspice
        pn Grated lemon and orange
           Peel
           Nonstick cooking spray
           (optional)
 
  Cut vegetables and fruit into small pieces.  Mix with cider and
  spices. Spray ovenproof container with nonstick cooking spray. Put
  vegetables and fruit into it and cover. Bake in 350 degree oven for
  45 minutes. Remove cover and add more cider if necessary.  You need
  enough liquid to keep it from burning, but not too much. Bake for at
  least 45 minutes more. The longer you bake it, the more the flavors
  blend.  I baked it for 1 1/2 hours more at 325 degrees.
  
  This comes out so sweet it could be either an accompaniment for a
  meal or a dessert.
  
  This is a slight modification of a recipe I found in a Blue Cross
  magazine.

 Categories: Breads, Seasonings
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine
      2 tb Sugar
      1 tb Baking yeast
    1/4 c  -Warm water
      3 c  Unbleached flour
      2    Eggs; lightly beaten
      1 c  Finely chopped fresh sage
           -OR-
      1 tb -Dried sage
      1 tb Finely chopped dill weed;
           -OR-
    1/2 tb -Dried dill weed
      4    Garlic cloves; crushed
      1 ts Salt
 
  Combine the milk, butter, and sugar in a small saucepan and heat,
  stirring, until the butter is melted. Remove from heat and set aside.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Add 2
  cups of flour and the eggs, squash, sage, dill, garlic, and salt. Mix
  slightly to combine ingredients. When the milk mixture has cooled to
  lukewarm, stir it in with the rest of the ingredients to form a
  sticky ball.
  
  Add the remaining flour 1/3 cup at a time, mixing to moisten each
  addition, until the dough becomes smooth. It will be wet and slightly
  sticky. Cover your hands with a little flour, turn the dough out onto
  a lightly floured surface, and knead briefly.
  
  Form the dough into a ball and place in a lightly greased loaf pan.
  It can also be divided into small balls to make dinner rolls (place
  on a lightly greased cookie sheet or in a muffin tin). Cover with
  plastic wrap and let rise until the dough has more than doubled,
  about 1 to 1-1/2 hours. While the dough is rising, preheat oven to
  275 degrees F.
  
  Place the risen dough in the oven and bake until the top is golden
  brown and the sides are slightly brown, an hour or 70 minutes. Check
  the sides by pulling the bread out of the pan. When done, cool bread
  on a wire rack, then serve or wrap and refrigerate.

      Title: WINTER SQUASH SOUP WITH CINNAMON & CLOVES
 Categories: Digest, Dec.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lb Dense winter squash such as
           Butternut (we used pumpkin)
     12    Corriander seeds
     12    Peppercorns
      2 c  Fatfree soymilk (we used the
           Westbrae WestSoy)
      1    3 inch cinnamon stick,
           Broken into pieces
      8    Cloves
      1    Jalapeno pepper or 2 small
           Dried red chilies, seeds
           Removed
      1    Onion, finely diced
      2 ts Each finely chopped mint and
           Cilantro for garnish (we
           Skipped this)
 
  Cut the squash in half and scoop out the seeds.  Cook the squash (We
  put it in the microwave, but she recommends baking it at 375 for
  30-45 minutes. We were afraid it'd dry out too much that way.) When
  the squash is cooked and cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh.
  
  While the squash is baking, make an infusion with the herbs and milk:
  first lightly crush the corriander seeds and peppercorns; then put
  them in a saucepan with the milk, cinnamon, cloves, and chilies. Heat
  the mixture slowly, but turn off the heat just before the milk comes
  to a boil Let it stand until needed.
  
  Saute the onions in water until they begin to soften. Add the squash
  and 1 qt. water.  Bring to a boil; then lower the heat and simmer
  until the squash is broken up, about 25 minutes.
  
  Pass the soup through a food mill or blen it briefly, leaving as much
  texture as you like.  Return the soup to the stove and add the milk,
  pouring it through a strainer. Try to press on the spices as you do,
  to get as much flavor into the soup as you can.  Gently reheat the
  soup, but do not allow it to boil.  Serve garnished with cilantro and
  mint.

  30-45 minutes. We were afraid it'd dry out too much that way.) When
  the squash is cooked and cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh.
  
  While the squash is baking, make an infusion with the herbs and milk:
  first lightly crush the corriander seeds and peppercorns; then put
  them in a saucepan with the milk, cinnamon, cloves, and chilies. Heat
  the mixture slowly, but turn off the heat just before the milk comes
  to a boil Let it stand until needed.
  
  Saute the onions in water until they begin to soften. Add the squash
  and 1 qt. water.  Bring to a boil; then lower the heat and simmer
  until the squash is broken up, about 25 minutes.
  
  Pass the soup through a food mill or blen it briefly, leaving as much
  texture as you like.  Return the soup to the stove and add the milk,
  pouring it through a strainer. Try to press on the spices as you do,
  to get as much flavor into the soup as you can.  Gently reheat the
  soup, but do not allow it to boil.  Serve garnished with cilantro and
  mint.

      1 lb Beef soup bones
           -(as meaty as possible;
           -meaty neck or cross-cut
           -shank bones are good)
     12 c  Water
      1 lg Onion, quartered
           -(don't use instant)
      2 lb Cooking tomatoes
           -(peeled), whole
           -(2 large cans)
    1/4 lb Green beans, fresh
      2 sm Carrots
    1/2 lb Green peas, unshelled
      1    Ear corn, fresh
      3    Bay leaves
      5 tb Basil, dried (or
           -1/2 cup fresh, chopped)
      2 tb Oregano, dried
           -(or 2-4 T fresh, chopped)
      1 tb Thyme, dried (or 2 T
           -fresh, chopped)
           Salt and pepper
 
  In a large, heavy pot, bring about 12 C of water to boil. Add beef
  bones, cover and bring back to full boil. Reduce heat to low simmer.
  Skim occasionally during first 30 minutes to remove scum. Cook for
  3-4 hours until meat is tender and nearly falls off of bones.
  
  Remove bones from broth.  Remove all meat and marrow from bones and
  return to the pot. Add tomatoes (including juice), onion and herbs.
  Simmer for 20 minutes.  Remove tomatoes, break up into quarters or
  smaller, and return to the pot.  Continue to simmer.
  
  Clean green beans and break into pieces.  Clean carrots and slice
  into thin slices.  Slice kernels from ear of corn. Shell peas. Add
  vegetables to pot. Simmer for 30 minutes. Add salt and pepper to
  taste and serve.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A thick and hearty vegetable beef soup, this soup is almost thick
  enough to be called a stew. It is great on a cold day or after skiing.
  
  *  I prefer beef neck or shank bones over what markets call "soup
  bones" which are nearly devoid of meat. Individual-serving size cans
  of green beans, corn and green peas may be substituted if fresh
  vegetables are not available. These are the basic vegetables I use,
  but I have also added mustard greens, chinese cabbage, zucchini and
  yellow squash (add just 5 minutes before serving or they become mush)
  turnips and any other fall/winter vegetables that look good in the
  market. Serve with cornbread, sourdough or another strong flavored
  bread. This soup improves with age.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  Several hours of intermittent attention.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

           Vegetable oil
           -or olive oil
           -for frying
           Salt to taste
 
  In a 3-quart saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the
  onion and garlic and sweat them until translucent, but not browned,
  about 5 minutes.
  
  Add the butternut and acorn squash, turnips and carrots. Cover and
  sweat for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  
  Add the stock and the thyme, bay leaf, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger,
  cayenne, allspice, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat,
  lower the heat to a simmer and cook for about 30 minutes, until the
  vegetables are soft. Stir occasionally.
  
  While the vegetables are cooking, prepare the shallots. Trim off both
  ends, cut them in half lengthwise, then thinly slice them lengthwise
  to get half moon pieces. Heat  inch of oil in a 10-inch frying pan
  over medium heat. Fry the shallots in two batches until golden brown
  (the shallot should sizzle on contact with the oil), about 30
  seconds. Drain on paper towels and salt lightly. The shallots will
  get crispier when then cool and may be made a day ahead just cover
  them well and keep them at room temperature.
  
  Pure the vegetables in a food processor or blender, adding a little
  cream or butter if desired. Season with a squeeze of lemon juice,
  then taste and adjust the seasonings. Serve in a shallow bowl
  sprinkled with the crispy shallots.

 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     12 lg Shallots
      4    Parsnips (about 1 1/2 pounds
           -total weight)
      2    Turnips (about one pound
           -total)
      2    Rutabagas (about 1 pound

           -weight)
      4    Or 5 large green chard
           -leaves
      3 tb Butter or alternative
           -(spectrum spread)
      1 tb Olive oil
      2 tb All purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Fresh ground black pepper
      1 ts Ground tumeric
    1/3 c  Dry white wine
      2 c  Leek and mushroom broth or
           -vegetable broth
      1 c  Water
    1/4 c  Raisins
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh dill
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh tarragon
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh mint
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh chives
      1 c  Plain yogurt
 
  Preheat oven to 350. Bring a saucepan full of water to a boil. Add the
  shallots and parboil for 5 minutes. Drain, let cool, and then remove
  the papery skins. Trim off the tips of the root ends, but do not cut
  into the flesh or the shallots may not stay intact during cooking.
  Set aside.
  
  Scrub the vegetables, but do not peel them. Cut the thick upper parts
  of the parsnips into 1 1/2 inch pieces. Leave the thin root end
  intact. Cut each turnip and rutabaga into quarters, then halve the
  quarters to make 8 pieces in all. Cut the carrots into 1 1/2 inch
  lengths.
  
  Remove the white ribs from the chard (reserve for another use). Cut
  the chard greens into chiffonade strips by stacking them, rolling
  them up lengthwise into a thin cigar shape, then cutting across into
  1/8-inch-wide "threads."
  
  In a large flameproof casserole over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons
  of the buttter (or butter replacement such as spectrum spread) with
  the olive oil. When the mixture begins to foam, add the parsnips,
  turnips, rutabagas, and carrots. Saute, turning frequently, until
  well coated and slightly softened, 5 to 6 minutes.
  
  In a small bowl, stir together the flour, salt, pepper, and tumeric.
  Sprinkle the mixture over the vegetables. Cook, turning the vegetables
  often, until the flour mixture has begun to brown, 3 or 4 minutes.
  Add the wine, stir for a minute or two, and then add the broth,
  water, half of the chard, and all of the raisins. Cover, place in the
  oven, and bake until the vegetables are tender when pierced with the
  tines of a fork, about 45 minutes.
  
  While the vegetables are baking, finish preparing the shallots. Heat
  the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter in a skillet over medium heat.
  Add the shallots and increase the heat to medium high. Cook the
  shallots, stirring and turning constantly, 3 to 4 minutes. The
  shallots will begin to brown and carmelize slightly yet still retain
  their shape.
  
  To finish the ragout, remove the casserole from the oven and stir in
  the cooked shallots and the remaining chard. In a small bowl, stir
  together the dill, tarragon, mint, and chives. Spoon the ragout into
  shallow bowls or plates and top each portion with several spoonfuls
  of yogurt and a generous spoonful of mixed herbs. Serve immediately.

  This began last night as an effort to make the Winter Vegetable Pie
  recipe in the _Fields of Greens_ cookbook just acquired (and thanks
  to those who sent advice on the book last month). As usual, however,
  we varied a great deal, so the result is greatly different from the
  book's--but was wonderful. We realized that the recipe started with
  "Mushroom stock," which would take 3 hours to make.  Since it was
  already 7 in the evening, that was out.  The celery root we thought
  was in the vegetable bin was a rutabaga; we had six shitake to use
  up.  So we improvised: Stock: Gently simmer, until reduced to about 2
  cups liquid.
  
  Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet; add the
  mushrooms, pinch of salt, 2 or 3 grinds of pepper. Sear the mushrooms
  over high heat until golden. Add half the garlic and deglaze the pan
  with half the sherry. When the pan is almost dry, transfer the
  mushrooms to a bowl. Heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in
  stew pot and add the onion, pinch of salt, 2 grinds of pepper; saute
  until onion is transparent. Add the remaining garlic, rutabaga,
  carrot, potatos, and fennel, saute for 5 minutes.  Add the mushrooms,
  herbs, and the reduced stock. Cover and simmer until vegetables are
  soft and flavors melded, about 30 minutes over medium/medium low
  heat. Serve over grain, pasta, or polenta (we used a mixed spiral
  spinach pasta and basmati rice left over from previous meals), with
  crusty bread, bread sticks, or pretzels. The _Fields of Greens_ book
  takes its mixture, pours it into a 9 inch round baking dish, then
  covers it with a white pastry cover, with an egg wash on it (there
  goes the vegan listing!), then bakes in 375 degree oven for 40
  minutes. Our variation worked well; we ate at about 8:45 (which is
  fairly normal for us), a rich and warming stew with the temperature
  outside at -5, wind chill -37. We'll try some different root
  vegetables next time, and perhaps add tofu slices as well.

  Fill a very large saucepan with lid, if possible 2/3 full with cold
  water and put it on to boil. This will take a long time, so peel and
  chop or slice the onion, carrots, turnip/swede and potatoes. Trim the
  leeks, slice down one side, and rinse them thoroughly in cold running
  water. Chop them into 1/2 inch rings. Stir the stock cube into the
  boiling water. Add all the prepared vegetables, the mixed herbs, and
  the pearl barley or rice as you like. Turn down the heat and simmer
  gently, stirring occasionally, until the potato has cooked enough to
  thicken the soup and all the other vegetables are tender, but still
  recognizable. It needs about 40 minutes. Add more water if required,
  a little at a time. Adjust flavor with salt and pepper, and tomato
  puree if liked.

      Title: WITCHES BREW MARINADE
 Categories: Marinades, Sauces
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
      2 tb Vinegar
      2 tb Brown sugar
    1/4 c  Lemon juice
      1 c  Ketchup
      3 tb Worcestershire sauce
    1/2 tb Mustard (any creamy kind)
           Salt & Pepper to taste
    1/2 c  Cooking oil
      3 tb Soy sauce
    1/4 c  Bottled french dressing
           Onion salt to taste
           Garlic salt to taste
           Meat tenderizer 1/2 t per
           -lb of meat
 
  Mix well. Marinate meat for a minimum of four hours.
  
  Here is the absolute best meat marinade I have ever had...I found it
  in "Delicious Decisions" the cookbook of the Jr. League of San Diego.
  I find that very, very inexpensive London Broil (even bottom round &
  shoulder) is almost butter tender when marinaded in this overnight
  then grilled (although broiling is almost as good). Slice thin across
  the grain & you'll surely impress guests! From goober273@aol.com Sat

      Title: WOK-FRIED SWEET & SOUR PORK
 Categories: Pork
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Egg yolk
      2 ts Water
      1 tb All-purpose flour
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 lb Pork -- 1" cubes
      2 c  Peanut oil
      1    Garlic clove -- minced
      2    Green peppers
      1 c  Pineapple chunks in juice
      3 c  Glutinous rice
 
  ~-- Sauce: --- 3/4 cup water 1 tablespoon cornstarch 1 tablespoon soy
  sauce 1      tablespoon    catsup 4 tablespoons sugar 4 tablespoons
  wine vinegar 1
      dash          hot pepper sauce
  
  SAUCE: Blend the water and cornstarch until smooth. Stir in the
  catsup, soy sauce, sugar, vinegar and, if desired, a few drops of hot
  pepper seasoning. Set aside.
  
  PORK: Beat egg yolk with the water. Blend in 1 tablespoon flour and 1
  tablespoon cornstarch until smooth. Add the cubed pork and mix to coat
  well. Drain off the excess mixture from the pork cubes. Place the wok
  over heat and add oil to 1-1/2 inch depth. Heat to 340 degrees. Use a
  thermometer if you can; it is more reliable than a wok with a
  temperature gauge. Add the drained meat and cook until golden brown,
  about 10-13 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and keep meat warm.
  Pour off all the oil and wipe wok with a paper towel. Return 2
  tablespoons of the oil to wok. Place over medium-high heat. When oil
  is hot, add the garlic and green peppers. Stir-fry for about 2
  minutes, or until garlic is light brown. Add the pineapple, the sauce
  you prepared ahead of time and the pork. Stir this mixture until it
  boils and thickens (about 1-1/2 minutes). Serve over steamy hot rice.

 Categories: Poultry, Salads, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------SALAD--------------------------------
    1/3 c  Matchstick strips fresh
           -ginger (from a 3-inch
           -piece), plus 4 nickel-size
           -slices, smashed
      6 tb Soy sauce
      3 tb Mushroom soy sauce*
      6 tb Sake or dry sherry
      2    Scallions including green
           -tops, cut into 1-inch
           -pieces
  1 1/2 tb Chopped cilantro leaves and
           -stems
      2 lb Boneless, skinless duck
           -breasts
    1/3 c  Sliced blanched almonds
      1 c  Cooking oil
    2/3 lb Bite-size pieces of mixed
           -lettuces, such as fris E9e,
           -mizuna and radicchio (about
           -4 quarts)

MMMMM----------------------GINGER DRESSING---------------------------
      1 tb Grated fresh ginger
      4 ts Orange juice
    1/2 ts Grated orange zest
      2 ts Balsamic vinegar
    1/2 ts Soy sauce
      1 pn Fresh-ground black pepper
      6 tb Oil reserved from frying
           -ginger
 
  *Available at Asian markets
  
  1. In a shallow glass dish or stainless-steel pan, combine the smashed
  ginger slices, the soy sauce, mushroom soy sauce, sake, scallions and
  cilantro. Add the duck breasts in a single layer and turn to coat.
  Marinate at room temperature for 1 hour, turning once.
  
  2. Heat the oven to 350 B0. Spread the almonds on a baking sheet and
  toast until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Let cool.
  
  3. Meanwhile, in a small frying pan, heat the oil over moderate heat
  to 375 B0. Remove the pan from the heat, add the ginger matchsticks
  and stir just until golden, about 10 seconds. With a slotted spoon,
  remove the ginger and drain on paper towels. Let the oil cool and
  then strain and set aside.
  
  4. Heat a wok or large frying pan over high heat until a bead of water
  evaporates on contact. Add 2 teaspoons of the reserved ginger oil and
  swirl to coat the pan. Remove half of the duck breasts from the
  marinade and add them to the wok in a single layer. Sear the duck
  until nicely browned, about 2 minutes. Turn and sear the other side,
  about 1 minute. Turn the breasts again and cook until medium-rare, 3
  to 5 minutes longer. Remove the duck breasts and let stand for 3
  minutes. Repeat with the remaining duck.
  
  5. Slice the duck breasts on the diagonal into 1/4-inch strips and
  transfer to a medium bowl. Whisk the Ginger Dressing, add 3
  tablespoons to the duck and toss to coat. In a large bowl, toss the
  greens with the remaining dressing. Mound the salad on six large
  plates and arrange the duck strips on top. Sprinkle with the toasted
  almonds and fried ginger matchsticks.
  
  Ginger Dressing (Makes about 1/2 cup)
  
  1. Put the ginger in a strainer set over a small bowl and press
  firmly to extract the juice. (You should have about 1-1/2 teaspoons.)
  
  2. Add the orange juice and zest, the balsamic vinegar, soy sauce and
  pepper. Add the oil slowly, whisking. The smokiness of the duck and
  the flavors of ginger and orange suggest pairing the dish with a
  full-bodied California pinot noir or a fruity zinfandel.

 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Flour
      1 ts Salt
      1    Egg, beaten
      2 tb Cold water
           Filling:
    1/4 lb Chopped pork
    1/4 lb Chopped raw shrimp
      2 ts Finely chopped onions
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Chopped button
           Mushrooms (optional)
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Cornstarch
 
  Sift the flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Add egg and water and mix

  1 hour. Place on floured board and roll until paper thin with rolling
  pin. Dust dough with flour and cut into 3-inch squares and stack.
  
  Combine all the filling ingredients and mix well. You are now ready
  to make the won ton.
  
  How To Wrap Won Ton: Hold square won ton skin on palm of left hand.
  Place 1/2 teaspoon filling in the corner of square closest to your
  wrist. Fold this corner over the filling, then roll toward the center
  of square so it resembles a triangle. Join the two rolled ends
  together with a tiny bit of filling. There are many ways to wrap won
  ton, but this is the most simple. It is now ready for soup or deep
  frying.
  
  Won Ton In Soup: Boil a large pot of water and add a little salt.
  Drop won ton a few at a time to cook. When the won ton floats to the
  top, the meat is cooked. Remove from the water with a large slotted
  spoon and drain. 2 qt. chicken broth 1/4 tsp. gourmet powder 1 tsp.
  soy sauce 2 stalks green onions, chopped Chinese parsley salt to
  taste few drops sesame oil (optional)
  
  Bring chicken broth, gourmet powder, soy sauce and sesame oil to a
  boil. Add salt to taste. Add cooked won ton and boil just enough to
  heat won ton. Do not overcook. Serve in a bowl. Garnish with diced
  green onions or parsley. Cooked chicken or barbecue pork may be added
  on top.
  
  Fried Won Ton: Heat about 3 to 4-inches of vegetable oil in a deep
  pot or frying pan. Put in wrapped won ton and fry to a golden brown.
  Delicious for cocktail parties.

      Title: WON TON SOUP (WON TON TONG)
 Categories: Chinese, Soups, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     30    Won ton filled according to
           -won ton recipe
      1 c  Roast pork, sliced
      1 qt Chicken and pork stock [Or
           -either one. S.C.]
      2    Stalks green onions, minced
      1 ts Sesame oil [The dark,
           -cooked Oriental type. S.C.]
 
  You can fiddle with the ingredients to your hearts content. Roast
  pork is available at Chinese markets and you could probably get it to
  go at Chinese restaurants.  Or try meat from good ol' American BBQ
  ribs, slivered. Or thinly sliced raw chicken.  Or thinly sliced
  shrimp or scallops. Or no meat at all...
  
  Yield: 4 servings
  
  PREPARATION:
  
  Prepare won ton filling and wrap as in won ton recipe. Heat stock.
  
  COOKING:
  
  Bring a pot of water to a boil.  Add won ton and boil for 4 to 5
  minutes. Remove won ton with bamboo skimmer or slotted spoon and
  transfer to soup bowls.  Garnish with roast pork and green onions.
  Pour heated stock over won ton.  Drizzle sesame oil over won ton and
  serve.
  
  DO-AHEAD NOTES;
  
  Wrap and freeze won ton.  Drop frozen won ton directly into boiling
  water and boil for 5 to 6 minutes.
  
  COMMENTS:
  
  Unless you're Chinese you probably don't know what won ton means.
  "Won" means cloud and "Ton" means swallow. Since won ton wrappers are
  light and fragile as clouds, biting onto won ton is like swallowing a
  cloud.

    1/4 ts Sea salt; especially if
           -unsalted vegetable bouillon
           -is used
    1/2 c  Almonds; roasted at home
           -chopped
 
  * to cook millet, use 2 1/2 cups water per 1 cup dry millet. It does
  not usually need prewashing. Cook 40-55 minutes and use as a
  substitute for rice  in rice dishes. This is one of the best grains,
  high in vitamins and very alkaline.
  
  Mix cooked millet, hazelnut flour (or ground nuts) and arrowroot
  powder (or substitute flours) together. Heat the oil and saute the
  onions, brocolli and carrots until semi-tender. Add the other
  vegetables and saute another 1-2 minutes more. Break up the bouillon
  cubes in the stir fry and mix them well with everything else. Remove
  the saute from heat and mix it well with the millet-flour mixture.
  Roll it into balls, using 1/8 - 1/4 cup for each ball. Bake the balls
  at 400F for 18-22 minutes until hot and toasted for a wonderful
  flavour.
  
  Serve with Arrowroot sauce, Mushroom Gravy, Vegetarian Gravy or
  Toasted Cashew or Sesame Sauce. Incredibly delicious!
  
  The 1/8 cup balls may be stir fried in a lightly oiled frying pan and
  served as "meat balls" with spaghetti and tomato sauce or they may be
  eaten plain or serve as suggested above. Cold leftover balls keep 4-6
  days refrigerated. They are terrific for lunches and snacks ~ a
  wonderful protein  and vitamin lift. MAKES: 2-4 dozen
  
  VARIATIONS: Rice or Quinoa Vegetable Balls: Instead of millet, brown
  rice may be used. Cook 7/8 cup rice in 2 1/4 cups water so that the
  rice is very tender. For Quinoa Vegetable Balls, cook 1 1/8 cups
  quinoa in only 2 cups water so that the grain will be less tender
  than usual. Measure 2 cups of the cold cooked grain before using in
  the recipe. Other grains may also be used. Experiment with kasha,
  buckwheat, pot barley, bulgur or other whole grains.
  
  Millet, Rice or Quinoa Vegetable Burgers Prepare the Wonderful Millet
  Vegetable Balls (or the grain you are using as above) and use 1/2 to
  3/4 cup of mixture for each burger. Lightly coat the burger with
  whole wheat, kamut or spelt flour. Grill them for 4-5 minutes on each
  side on medium-high heat in a skillet or on a griddle. serve with
  natural ketchup, mustard, pickle and a bun if desired.
  
  Tofu Vegetable balls or Burgers Prepare the Wonderful Millet
  Vegetables (above) except use 1 lb of regular tofu, crumbled instead
  of the millet.
  
  T.V.P. Vegetable Balls or Burgers Prepare the Wonderful Millet
  Vegetable Balls (above) but in place of the millet use 1 cup
  texturized vegetable protein (T.V.P.) or texturized soy protein
  soaked in 7/8 cup boiling water for 10 minutes or until the T.V.P.
  expands and softens.

  :          pistachio nuts
  :          Additional confectioners'
  :          sugar
  :          Mint sprigs
  :          Filling:
        1 lb lowfat Ricotta cheese, --
  :          beaten smooth
      1/2 c  sifted confectioners' sugar
        1 ts pure vanilla extract
      1/3 c  shaved semisweet chocolate
  
  Heat oil in deep fryer to 375. Work with 6 wonton skins at a time.
  Keep remainder well wrapped in waxed paper and draped with lightly
  dampened towel. Place a wonton skin on work surface and set a cannoli
  tube diagonally across center of it. If you don't have a cannoli
  tube, form a tube with some aluminum foil. Bring sides of skin up
  over tube. Seal overlapping tips with a dab of water. Form wonton
  skins around remaining 5 tubes. Cook, 2 tubes at a time, seam side
  down in hot oil, for 30 seconds or just until golden. Remove with
  tongs and drain on paper toweling. While shells are still hot, gently
  push them off tubes with a small metal spatula and your fingers.
  Repeat with remaining skins and be sure tubes cool completely before
  wrapping with skins.
  
  Filling: Combine ricotta, confectioners' sugar, Vanilla and chocolate.
  Cover and chill 2 hours or overnight. To serve: spoon filling into
  cannoli shells. A pastry bag will be very helpful here, or cut a
  corner off of a sandwich bag and squeeze the mixture out of it. Dip
  each end of filling in pistachios. Arrange on serving plate. Sift
  additional sugar over each and garnish with mint sprigs.

      Title: WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE-HOME MADE & RECIPE FOR W
 Categories: Ron's, Sauces, British
      Yield: 1 1.5 litres
 
      4    Shallots
      1 l  Vinegar, good malt
     90 ml Walnut Ketchup *See Recipe
     75 ml Anchovy essence
     60 ml Soy sauce
  2 1/2 ml Cayenne pepper
           Salt
 
  Store bought Worcestershire Sauce is a little expensive if, like me,
  you use a lot!  The following will yield 1 1/2 litres [2 1/4 British
  Pints] and, in my opinion, is far tastier
  :)   The Walnut Ketchup is also a tasty little sauce in it's own
  right.
  
  Worcestershire Sauce: Combine all the above in a clean bottle. Seal it

  small bottles, leaving some room in the neck. Seal tightly. Label and
  store in a cool, dry place. Small bottles with plastic screw tops are
  ideal as the vinegar will attack metal.
  
  Walnut Ketchup: Walnut Ketchup is the base for many classic
  sauces/ketchups. To make it you need green walnuts ie: gathered
  before the shells harden!
  
  400g onions, chopped. 2 litre malt vinegar. 200g salt. 25g whole
  peppercorns. 15g whole allspice berries. 2.5ml whole cloves. 1.25ml
  ground nutmeg. 10 green walnuts:
  
  Put everything, except walnuts, into a preserving pan & bring to the
  boil. Pop on some gloves to prevent staining & cut and crush the
  walnuts. Pour the boiling liquid over the walnuts and leave for 14
  days, stirring daily. Strain the liquid and simmer for 1 hour.
  Bottle, label and store in a cool dry place.

      Title: WORKING WITH SAFFRON
 Categories: Ceideburg
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  Pulled out my saffron book, which I hadn't really looked at closely,
  and discovered that it was written by a local gal. And is autographed
  to boot. Sat down at my scanner and it was so interesting I could
  hardly get up. There's a lot of historical stuff, but I thought you
  might be interested in what it says about countries propagating and
  selling the corms++Japan, the Netherlands and *Oregon, USA*!  This
  first post is about how to prepare the stuff for use.
  
  Saffron is no more difficult to work with than any other herb or
  spice, but it is different.  Central to getting good results is not
  to be wasteful and at the same time to respect saffron's potency.
  These two rules contradict each other only if you have measured out
  too much saffron to begin with. To be fully activated, saffron
  threads (hereafter referred to as threads) must come in contact with:
  HEAT, ALCOHOL, CITRUS OR MUST BE POUNDED IN A MORTAR.
  
  I discovered how long good threads release color and flavor by
  pouring two kettles worth of boiling water over 1/2 teaspoon of
  threads (1/4 gram) and leaving them overnight. By morning I had
  enough yellow- orange liquid to make 40 glasses of tea by adding
  lemon juice, sugar and ice cubes to the concentrate.
  
  Threads can also be steeped in lemon juice, rose or orange water,
  stocks, bouillons, vinegar, or white wine. I find red wine too heavy
  to use with saffron. No cookbook authors seem to agree on how long
  saffron should steep (opinions vary from 3 minutes to 48 hours!). For
  practicality and cost effectiveness, I have settled on 20 minutes.
  
  You can achieve great color (pale custard to vibrant yellow-orange)
  in a matter of minutes with good saffron. It is the flavor which
  takes longer to come out. I find that as long as I begin my prep work
  with the steeping, I do not prolong my time in the kitchen. It is a
  matter of getting in the habit.  As long as I steep my threads for 20
  minutes, it does not seem to matter when I add them to what I am
  cooking.
  
  I was surprised to see Gina Sarra, my hostess in Italy's Abruzzo, add
  the saffron paste, made ahead by adding boiling water to powder, to
  her spaghetti just before she served it. Again, the key is in
  activating the spice with heat.
  
  POWDERED SAFFRON:
  
  I have not found it necessary to steep powdered saffron. When I bake
  I find it practical to use powder because it works into chilled
  butter nicely. The butter's hard surface necessitates the right
  amount of pressure to release saffron's color and flavor. Room
  temperature butter is too soft to release color although the flavor
  seems to release regardless. If you prefer, saffron can be added to
  milk or water in a baking recipe as well.
  
  Keep in mind 1/2 teaspoon of threads crushes down to a scant 1/8
  teaspoon of powder.  This is why powdered saffron appears so much
  more expensive than threads. If you are particularly interested in
  powder, you can often find it in Italian delicatessens and gourmet
  shops.
  
  Powdering threads is simple.  In the beginning, use a heavy skillet
  with white insides against which you will be able to monitor the dark
  threads easier than you can in a black skillet. Over low heat, toast
  the threads just until crispy enough to crumble with your fingers (no
  more than 2 minutes).  It is not a good idea to have your attention
  on any other prep work while you do this. Dump the crispy threads
  onto kitchen paper and crush them with the back of an ordinary metal
  spoon.

 Categories: Cookies, Chocolate
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Brown sugar
      1 c  Butter
      1 tb Vanilla
      2    Eggs, slightly beaten

    3/4 ts Baking soda
    3/4 ts Salt
      3 c  Semi-sweet chocolate chips
      1 c  Chopped nuts (optional)
 
   This recipe is said to have come from a famous cookie maker. So make,
  bake, and compare to see if these cookies aren't "the real thing." One
  feature that distinguishes these cookies from traditional chocolate
  chip cookies is their perfect size. It comes from using a small size
  ice cream scoop to drop them onto the cookie sheet.
  
   Preheat oven to 350ø.
  
   In a large bowl, combine sugars; add in butter and cream together
  with the sugar. Add vanilla and eggs; mix together.
  
   In a separate bowl sift the dry ingredients and add to the creamed
  mixture. Mix well; the dough will be stiff. Add the chocolate chips
  and nuts (if using).
  
   Line the cookie sheets with baking parchment or wax paper. Drop
  dough with a small ice cream scoop onto the sheets. Bake 10-12
  minutes at 350ø. Remove from oven and cool on wire racks.
  
   Variation: For ice cream sandwiches, turn one cookie face down,
  place a scoop of ice cream on it and top with another cookie.

  1. Save wine bottles and corks to store marinades and salad dressings.
  
  2. According to "25 Common Cooking Mistakes... and how to avoid them",
     Christopher Kimball, Editor and Publisher of Cook's Illustrated,
     writes "don't marinate for tenderness - marinating is wonderful for
     adding flavor but does nothing for tenderness."  In tests performed
     at Cook's, marinating does not deeply penetrate meat. As a result,
     only the near top surfaces of the meat actually absorb the
  marinade.
  
     One solution to the marinade and tenderizing problem is to use a
     mechanical meat tenderizer.  One such tool is pictured, and its
     operation explained, at http://www.accesscomm.net/plan_b.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Green tomatoes, sliced verti
           -cally 1/4 inch thick
      3    Garlic, clove, sliced
    3/4 c  Flour
           Salt
           Pepper
      4 tb Olive oil
 
  Shake tomato slices in a paper sack with salt, pepper and flour. Heat
  oil over medium-high heat in a black iron skillet. Add tomatoes and
  garlic. Cook without stirring for about 5 minutes, then, using a
  stiff spatula, scrape bottom of skillet and turn tomatoes. Continue
  to cook over medium to high heat, scraping bottom of skillet
  occasionally to prevent burning. You want the tomatoes which come in
  direct contact with the skillet to get dark. You should expect some
  sticking; just scrape hard. Try to resist adding more oil but do so
  if you must. When most of the tomatoes have turned olive green or
  dark brown, about 20 minutes, lower heat to low. Continue to cook,
  worrying the tomatoes around with the spatula until they are all
  either brown or olive green.

  Salt and pepper to taste Nutmeg or cumin optional. 1 hard-boiled egg
  per person Cook onion over low heat, not in any fat, for a long time,
  stirring constantly over very low heat until all the water is
  evaporated. Continue stirring until onions are slightly brown. THEN
  add the butter; cook about 15-20 minutes still over low heat. Add 1
  tbsp hot water from time to time (texture should be kind of pasty).
  Add bere bere. If it looks too dry, add hot water and stir. Cook it
  about 30-45 minutes - keep stirring frequently. Keep adding hot water
  if necessary. Be careful not to let it brown, because chili powder
  will become bitter. Add gar lic and ginger and simmer 15 moreminutes.
  Add water as needed. Meanwhile, with your other set of free hands,
  wash chicken peices well, and let stand in salted in lemoned water.
  Then squeeze each peice really hard to get out as much water as
  possible. Then, make little slits in the meat so the sauce will
  penetrate. Cook the meat in the sauce until meat tis tender, about 30
  minutes. Stir from time to time. All this has been uncovered, by the
  way. Add spices to taste just before removing from stove. Add 1
  hard-boiled egg per person, which have been slit (the eggs, not the
  people), and cook just long enough to heat through. Serve with lots
  of bread (injera). Freezes well. Sorry about the wierd format, I am
  anything but a master of UNIX. (Argh) - ++ Wot (this is a chicken

      Title: WW I RATION WAR CAKE - NO EGGS~ BUTTER OR MIL
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Brown sugar
    1/3 c  Shortening (that meant
           -crisco then)
  1 1/4 c  Raisins
    1/2 c  Chopped dates
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Ground nutmeg
      1 ts Groung cinnamon
      2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Baking soda
 
  This could be called a heavy fruitcake. Boil sugar, shortening,
  raisins, dates, salt and spices for 3 min. Remove from heat and let
  cool. When cool, add flour and baking soda that have veen sifted
  together; beat well. Pour into a greased 9x5 inch loaf pan and bake
  at 350 degrees for 45 min.
  
  This was a VERY popular recipe at the Oakland Navy yard during the
  era. And what I find amusing...it is a good recipe to make for
  camping trips today. There isn't much in it to spoil. You could even
  make this on your upcoming camping trip!

      Title: XIAO LONG TANG BAO*
 Categories: Chinese, Loo, Breads, Pork
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
     11 oz Pork loin with some fat,
           -chopped or ground coarse
      2 ts Soy sauce
      1 tb Sesame oil
      2 tb Scallion greens, chopped
  1 1/2 ts Ginger root, chopped fine
      6 tb Water
    1/4 c  Stiff aspic
           -(jellied stock)
    1/4    Recipe basic yeast dough
 
  The Chinese for this dish can be transliterated as anything from "Show
  loong tong bow" to "Hsiao lung t'ang pao" to Xiao long tang bao*
  Little juicy steamed rolls ...Juicy steamed buns with pork
  
  Mix first 8 ingredients. Divide into 24 portions. Cut aspic into 24
  portions. Knead dough 5 min; roll out into a thin baguette; cut into
  24 pieces. Flatten each piece into a 2" round; then go around with
  your fingers and squeeze the edges thin - the result should be a
  medium-thin center and a thin outside. Put 1 portion (1/2 oz) filling
  in the center of each round; top with 1 portion of aspic. Bring up
  the sides of each round and twist up in a decorative pattern, making
  sure to seal the top. If holes appear, patch them at once!
  
  Put each dumpling on a square of waxed paper or a piece of bok choy
  leaf and steam, preferably in a bamboo steamer, for 8 min. Serve hot.
  
  Note on aspic:
  
  If you don't have any on hand, use about 1 1/2 c of homemade chicken
  broth (or good-quality canned low-salt broth): boil 1 c of broth,
  uncovered, for about 2 min (reducing it quite a bit) while dissolving
  1 envelope gelatin in the other 1/2 c. Mix together and stir over low
  heat until all gelatin is dissolved. Chill. This will make a hard
  aspic, enough for 3 recipes of this dim sum.

  40 minutes, or until the chicken is almost cooked. Be sure that the
  mixture does not boil and stir occasionally so that the chicken
  pieces do not stick to the pan. Add the jumbo shrimp, malagueta
  peppers, and ground nuts. Check the seasonings. Add the ginger and
  remaining water and finish cooking by bringing the mixture to a boil.
  When ready to serve, drizzle the dende over the xim-xim and cook for
  a few more minutes. Serve hot with white rice and Farofa. ----

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4    Habanero chiles, seeds and
           -stems removed and diced
           Juice of 4 limes
           I onion, diced
      1    Tomato, diced
 
  We're having our annual "Fall Festival" here in Castro Valley, but it
  looks like it doesn't hold a candle to the Austin Hot Sauce Contest.
  
  I really got a kick out of the paper.  Austin looks like a very
  interesting place.  Here's the Habanero salsa recipe. I would
  approach this with the greatest caution. ;-}
  
  You don't find too many recipes for Habanero chiles. This is Pinch a
  Pollo restaurant's recipe for a delicious pico de gallo made with
  fresh Habaneros.
  
  Soak the diced onion in the lime juice for at least 30 minutes. Add
  all the other ingredients and mix.  Salt to taste. Serve with grilled
  fish or grilled chicken. Caution: Extremely hot!

  Place rice in a colander and rinse under cold water. In a large pot

      Title: XXXX-HOT CARRIBBEAN HABANERO HOT SAUCE
 Categories: Sauce
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
     12    Habanero peppers; hand
           -picked
      4    -(up to)
      5    Dried; smoked Jalapenos (can
           -use fresh; if desired)
      2    Papayas
      3 tb Chopped onion
    1/4 c  Vinegar; or more
      2 tb Lime juice
      1 tb Salt
      1 tb Sugar
      1 pn Cinnamon (can omit; if
           -desired)
      1 pn Garlic
    1/4 c  Mustard; or less
 
  ~Hydrate the dried jalapenos.  Retain approx. 1/4 cup of the liquid.
  
  ~Chop all solids.  Throw into blender with liquid ingredients.
  "Liquify" for a good, long time ... goal here is to do away with all
  chunks of anything. Note: I left seeds & "flesh" of peppers intact.
  For a more mild sauce, you may want to extract these
  
  ~Once mixture is very smooth, cook over very low heat for 30-60
  minutes. Stir often.  During this time, taste (as much as you are
  able to), and add add'l amounts of desired ingredients until you
  acheive the taste you desire. Goal is to come up with a sauce that is
  sweet at first taste, then leaves a healthy amount of pain as the
  taste fades away.
  
  ~Remove from heat, cool 30-60 minutes.
  
  ~Strain mixture to extract liquid, leave behind seeds, pulp, etc.
  This will take a while - be patient.
  
  ~Store extracted liquid in an air-tight container, or in a sealed
  bottle. Time will increase heat & taste.
  
  Note:  Like many cooks, I created this with no precise measurements
  ... it was a total experiment & actually turned out very well (though
  very painful). Please feel free to alter/experiment.

           - slightly crushed
      2 ts Sesame oil
    1/4 ts Ground pepper
     40    Wonton wrappers
 
  Sprinkle the cabbage leaves with 1/2 tsp salt and let stand about 15
  minutes until they wilt.  Squeeze out any moisture, then rinse and
  dry the leaves.  Chop the cabbage. In a bowl combine the cabbage,
  beef, scallions, garlic, soy sauce, sesame seeds, sesame oil, pepper
  and 1/4 tsp salt and mix thoroughly.  To make each dumpling, place 1
  1/2 teaspoonful filling in the center of a wrapper using two spoons.
  Fold the wonton wrapper in half to form a semi-circle (if using round
  wrappers) or a triangle (if using square wrappers). Seal the edges by
  moistening them with a little water and pinching them.  You may
  freeze the dumplings at this point on a cookie sheet or continue to
  use them by frying, steaming or in a soup.
  
  To Fry:  Heat oil in a wok or frying pan to 360 degrees. Fry about 10
  at a time for 3 minutes or until golden.
  
  To Steam:  Arrange on lightly oiled plate, but do not let them touch
  each other.  Pour about 2 inches of boiling water into a wok, set the
  plates in the steamer and set the steamer in the wok. Cover the
  steamer and cook over medium heat for 20 minutes.
  
  Skillet Method:  In a 12" skillet heat 2 tablespoons of oil until
  hot. Fill the skillet with mandu, making sure that they do not touch.
  Cook until the bottoms brown; about 1 minute. Add 1/3 cup water or

      Yield: 30 Servings
 
      6 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Onion, finely chopped
    1/3 c  Long grain rice
    3/4 c  Water
    1/2 ts Salt
           Black pepper, freshly ground
      2 tb Pine nuts
      2 tb Dried currants
     40 ea Grape leaves, preserved
      2 tb Cold water
           Lemon wedges
 
  In a heavy 10" to 12" skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil
  over a moderate heat until a light haze forms above it. Add the
  onions & cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until they are soft
  & transparent but not brown.  Add the rice & stir constantly for 2 to
  3 minutes, or until the grains are coated with oil. Do not let them
  brown. Pour in the water, add the salt & a few grindings of pepper &
  bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover
  tightly, & simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the rice is tender &
  has absorbed all the liquid. In a small skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of
  the remaining olive oil & in it cook the pine nuts until they are a
  delicate brown. Add them to the rice, then stir in the currants. In a
  large pot, bring 2 quarts of water to a boil over high heat. Drop in
  the grape leaves and immediately turn off the heat. Let the leaves
  soak for 1 minute, then drain them in a sieve and plunge them into a
  bowl or pan of cold water to cool them quickly. Gently separate the
  leaves and spread them, dull sides up, on paper towels to drain.
  Layer the bottom of a heavy 2 to 3 quart casserole with 10 of the
  leaves. Stuff each of the remaining 30 leaves with about 1 tablespoon
  of the rice mixture. Stack the stuffed leaves, side by side and seam
  sides down, in layers in the casserole and sprinkle them with the
  remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and the cold water. Place the
  casserole over high heat for 3 minutes, reduce the heat to low and
  simmer, tightly covered, for 50 minutes. Then uncover and cool to
  room temperature. To serve, arrange the stuffed grape leaves
  attractively on a platter or individual plates and garnish with lemon
  wedges.

 Categories: Digest, Dec.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    40-oz can yams/sweet
           Potatoes
      1    29-oz can tomato puree
      1    To 2 cup dried beans (*)
    1/4 c  Barbecue sauce
      1 tb Dehydrated onion
      1 ts Black Pepper
      1 tb Chili powder
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
 
  Cook up the beans normally (soak, boil, simmer).
  
  Pour yams into pot, including liquid.  Smash lightly. Add tomato
  puree, stir through.  Add spices, stir through. Add cooked beans,
  stir through. Simmer for for a few minutes to mellow out.
  
  (*) Beans:  I keep a 'bean bucket' of mixed beans, usually including
  pea beans, black-eyed peas, pinto beans, split peas, lentils, navy
  beans, pinto beans; often including great northern beans, roman
  beans, pink beans, chili beans, barley, and others.  Whenever there's
  room in the bucket I pour in a bag of something that seems
  underrepresented.
  
  This would probably be better with fresh yams and tomatoes, but the
  canned yams were on sale half price the day after Thanksgiving...

      Title: YAM CRACKERS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 70 Servings
 
      1 lg Yam or sweet potato,
           Peeled and cut into large
           Pieces
      1 c  All-purpose or whole wheat
           Flour
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
  2 1/2 ts Raw sugar or brown sugar,
           Loosely packed
      1 tb Butter or margarine,
           Softened
 
  "A painless way to eat your vegetables, these crackers have a mellow
  yam taste. Spread some sweet butter on a few and rest under a shade
  tree, thinking of Thanksgivings past. 325~F. 25 to 30 minutes
  
  Place the yam in a saucepan, cover with water, and boil until soft
  (about 15 minutes). The tines of a fork should push easily into the
  yam. Drain the yam. Puree the yam with 2 Tablespoons of water in the
  blender or food processor, or puree it by hand with a fork or potato
  masher. Measure out 1 cup of the puree for use in this recipe. Save
  the rest for another use.
  
  Preheat the oven to 325~F. In a large bowl or in the food processor,
  combine the flour, salt, cinnamon, and sugar.
  
  Cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse meal.
  Add the pureed yam and blend well. Gather the dough into a ball. The
  dough will be very soft. For easier rolling, wrap it in wax paper and
  chill for 1/2 hour.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a well-floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll the dough out to about 1/8 inch thick.
  With a sharp knife, cut the dough into graham cracker shapes, 2-inch
  by 3-inch rectangles. Transfer them to an ungreased baking sheet.
  Prick each one in 3 places with the tines of a fork.
  
  Bake for 20 minutes. Turn the crackers and continue baking for
  another 5 to 10 minutes, or until they are just golden brown. Remove
  any crackers that brown before the others. Be careful not to overbake
  these crackers. Cool them on a rack. Yield: 60-70.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Tender yams
      1    To 2 Tbsp salt
      3 c  Vegetable oil for deep
           Frying
      2    In fresh ginger root
      1    Garlic clove
      2    To 3 Tbsp  vegetable oil
      1 ts Cumin seeds
      2    Green cardamoms
      1    Bay leaf
      4    Peppercorns
      1    Inch stick cinnamon
      1 ts Turmeric
    1/2 ts Chili powder (or use cayenne
           Pepper)
      1 ts Ground coriander
    1/2 ts Garam masala (optional)
           To taste  salt
      4 oz Fresh tomatoes (or use 8 oz
           Canned tomatoes)
      4 tb Yogurt
  1 1/2    Cups water
      1 tb Chopped coriander leaves
           (cilantro)
 
  The yams in this dish are cooked in a sauce very  much like that
  traditionally used  for meat. Serve with chapatis and rice. The
  recipe is derived from one  in The Hamlyn Curry Cookbook, by Meera
  Taneja, which I recommend highly.
  
  (1)  Peel the yams, cut them into 1 inch  cubes, place in a colander
  and sprinkle liberally with salt. Let stand 10-15 minutes, then dry
  on paper towels.
  
  (2)  Meanwhile, finely  chop  the  onion,  ginger, and garlic, and
  roughly chop the tomatoes. Heat the il over a moderate flame, add the
  cumin seed, and cook until they begin to splutter. Add the chopped
  onion, ginger, and garlic. Cook until the onion is a rich golden
  color. Add all the spices and season with salt to taste. Cook a few
  seconds more, and then add the tomatoes. Let this cook while you
  continue as below.
  
  (3)  Heat the oil for deep frying to  350  deg.  F and cook the yam
  cubes, a few at a time, until golden brown. Drain on absorbent
  kitchen paper. Set aside.
  
  (4)  Add the yogurt to the tomato mixture, and continue to cook until
  the oil begins to separate out. Add the water and bring to a boil.
  Let boil a few minutes, then add the yam cubes, reduce heat, and
  simmer, covered, for about 25 minutes.
  
  (5)  Serve hot, garnished with the chopped coriander.
  
  Difficulty: easy to moderate.  Time: 1 hour preparation, 30 minutes
  cooking.  Precision: measure the ingredients.

      6    Shallots, thinly sliced
      1 c  Vegetable oil
 
  It's almost Chinese New Year and the stores are all stocking up on
  fresh fruits which are a traditional Chinese gift for the season.
  Pomelos are a big citrus fruit much like grapefruit, but somewhat
  drier and sweeter. This Thai recipe makes use of them and you should
  be able to find them this time of year.  If not grapefruit will do.
  This is from an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, 1/30/91, by
  Joyce Jue.
  
  Peel and separate pomelo or grapefruit into segments. Remove the
  membranes. Seed.  Gently flake the flesh apart into a bowl. Chill.
  Hand shred the chicken. Add chicken and shrimp to pomelo.
  
  In a small bowl mix together the chopped red chile with fish sauce,
  sugar, lime juice and coriander; toss with pomelo chicken mixture.
  
  Arrange the lettuce on a serving platter.  Put the fruit mixture over
  the lettuce.  Top with peanuts and 2 tablespoons of Crisp Fried
  Shallot Flakes, and garnish with red chile slivers.
  
  Serves 4 to 6 as a salad entree.
  
  CRISP FRIED SHALLOT FLAKES: Slice shallots into thin slices. Be sure
  they are all of the same thinness to ensure even cooking. Heat a pan
  with the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add shallots and fry slowly
  until browned and crisp, 5 to 10 minutes. The moisture in the
  shallots should be completely cooked out. Drain on paper towel. Store
  in an air-tight container.  Will keep several weeks.

  From: "Colonel I. F. K. Philpott" <colonel@korat1.vu-korat.ac.th> This
  variation of yam talay could of course be made with any combination of
  seafood you have to hand. It is a popular "pre-drink" food in Thai
  bars - I leave it to the reader to guess why! fish and shrimp balls
  are sold in Asian supermarkets. If you can't find them use a little
  extra shrimp and crab.
  
  Line a serving bowl with lettuce or kale leaves, Mix the non-seafood
  ingredients in a saucepan, and bring to a gentle simmer. Add the
  seafood and stir occasionally until the seafood is just cooked. Pour
  onto the bed of lettuse, and garnish with shredded lettuce, coriander
  leaves, and slices of cucumber. (serves four as an appetiser).

  From: The Meades <kmeade@ids2.idsonline.com> (by way of If ever there
  was a subject close to my heart (well, my stomach is close to my
  heart -- especially when I overeat), it is noodle soups. I guess that
  I eat a noodle soup or stir fried noodle dish about 8 times a week,
  and the repeat cycle is about 3 months. However, they have a nasty
  tendency to read rather repetitively: the techniques and basic
  principles involved come down to 4 or 5 "signature" dishes, of which
  this is one.
  
  When a soup is described as a "yam", it means that everything is just
  tossed into the stock as it simmers. This soup is also sometimes
  called Kaeng Jued Wunsen (Kaeng Jued implies a rather bland soup --
  by Thai standards!).
  
  This can be made with a variety of ingredients, but the most
  interesting are probably pork (as here), beef, chicken, shrimp, meat
  balls, fish balls, shrimp balls, or "monkey balls" (a mixed meat ball
  ~ not actually made from monkey meat!), or one of the various Thai
  sausages, as well as vegetarian options (for a quick veggie variation
  try marinating some tofu in dark sweet soy sauce for about 3 hours
  and then using that instead of the pork).
  
  Maggi sauce is a dark (nearly black) sauce made by the Maggi
  corporation, and widely available...
  
  Method: Mix the marinade ingredients, mix with the ground pork, and
  make the pork into small meat balls, then set aside and leave to
  marinate for 3 or 4 hours.
  
  Soak and drain the noodles.
  
  Bring the stock to a boil and add all the ingredients except the
  noodles, and continue to boil until the meatballs are cooked through,
  when they will float.
  
  Remove from the heat, pour into a serving bowl and add the noodles
  (note the immersion in the near boiling soup is enough to cook the
  noodles).
  
  Serve with the usual Thai table condiments (nam pla prik [chilies in
  fish sauce], prik dong [chilies in vinegar], sugar, prik phom [ground
  chilies], and ground peanuts. Colonel Ian F. Khuntilanont-Philpott

  all meat is browned. Pour off any remaining fat, and replace the
  casserole over medium heat. Add the onion, half the carrots, celery,
  garlic and tomato paste. Cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Use
  your spoon to loosen and dissolve the brown bits stuck to the bottom
  of the casserole. Add flour and cook, stirring, an additional minute.
  Add the wine and cook for about a minute to burn off the alcohol.
  Replace the meat (and any juices on the plate) in the casserole and
  add the stock, peppercorns and thyme. Cover, bring to a boil and
  place in the oven for 1 1/4-to-1 1/2 hours, or until meat is tender.
  Meanwhile, combine potatoes, remaining carrots and butter with 1/2
  cup of water in a medium saucepan over medium heat and cook for 5
  minutes. Add the turnips and cook, stirring occasionally, until all
  water is evaporated, leaving the vegetables bathed in butter, about
  another 5 minutes. Add the peas, remove from the heat and set aside.
  Remove the casserole from the oven. Using a slotted spoon, remove the
  meat from the sauce and place it in a bowl. Pour the sauce through a
  fine strainer into another bowl and discard the vegetables and spices
  that remain in the strainer. Replace meat in the pot, add the cooked
  vegetables and the sauce. Cover and place over medium heat for 5
  minutes. Serve piping hot.

      1 tb Active dry yeast
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/3 c  Plus 2 tablespoons olive oil
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Whole wheat flour
  2 1/2 c  White flour
      1    Egg, beaten
      1 tb Milk (or cream or water)
 
  I love little meat pies of any description.  In the case of samosas,
  they don't even have to have meat in 'em. Here's a series of seven
  recipes from all over the world for "turnovers".
  
  Dissolve yeast and sugar in 1/2 cup of the warm water. Let stand for
  10 minutes until bubbly.  Then stir in remaining warm water 1/3 cup
  olive oil, salt and whole-wheat flour. Mix well.
  
  Stir in 2 cups white flour and as much of the rest as needed to make
  a soft dough.  Knead well.  Oil the sides of a large bowl with the
  remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Put the dough in the bowl and
  turn to coat with oil.  Let rise until doubled, 1 hour.  Punch dough
  down and let sit for 10 minutes.
  
  Roll dough into 20 x 24-inch rectangle and cut into 4 x 4-inch
  squares. Fill with the salmon-rice or other desired filling. Fold
  over and seal. Trim excess pastry and decorate top of turnover. Let
  rise for 10 minutes. Mix egg and milk (or cream or water) to make an
  egg wash and brush it on top of the turnover.  Bake in a 400F oven
  for 20 to 25 minutes until golden.
  
  Makes 30 pasties.

      2    Red cherries
    2/3 c  Coconut flakes
 
   Procedure:
  
   1) Put the glutinous rice powder on a flour board.
   Make a hole in the center.  Add sugar and lard.
  
   2) Put the cornstarch in a bowl.  Add boiling water.
   Mix with chopsticks. Pour into glutinous rice powder and knead
  together. If too hard, add some cold water to the dough and knead
  until very smooth and soft.
   (This is the skin).
  
   3) Divide the sweet bean paste into 20 small round pieces (this is
  the filling).  Cut each cherry into 10 small pieces.
  
   4) Cut the dough into 20 small pieces.  Flatten each small piece of
  dough with the palm of hand.  Place 1 piece of sweet bean paste
  filling (ball shape) in center of dough, let all the edges come up to
  top center, so that the dumpling is round.  Place all dumplings on a
  greased steamer. Put in place over boiling water. Steam about 8 to 10
  minutes.
  
   5) Remove and coat with coconut when dumplings are still very hot.
  Decorate the top with a small piece of red cherry. Serve cold.

      Title: YELLOW CAKE MIX
 Categories: Cakes, Make ahead
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 7/8 c  Cake flour
  2 1/2 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Vegetable Shortening
 
  Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt; stir to blend; resift
  with sugar.  Cut the shortening into the dry ingredients until the
  mixture looks crumbly. Label and store in a sealed plastic bag at
  room temperature. Makes 1 pakage mix. Each package makes two 8 or 9
  inch layers or one 9 x 13 x 2 inch rectangle. TO USE: Pour 1 package
  of mix into a mixing bowl; add 3/4 cup milk and 1 1/4 teaspoons
  vanilla extract. Using either an electric or manual rotary beater,
  beat at slow to medium speed for two minutes (by hand, beat 3 minutes
  averaging 135 strokes per minute). Scrape the sides of the bowl
  frequently as you beat. Add 2 eggs; beat 1 minute more (2 minutes by
  hand). Grease and dust with flour your choice of pan(s); spread
  batter evenly in pans. Bake round cake pans at 375 degrees F. for
  about 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes
  out clean; bake the 9 x 13 x 2 inch pan for 30 to 35 minutes or until
  a toothpick comes out clean. Cool cake(s) for 10 minutes in their
  pan(s) before turning out on racks. WHITE CAKE Follow the same
  directions as for Yellow Cake replacing the 2 eggs with 3 unbeaten
  egg whites. Use an electric mixer for beating. SPICE CAKE Add to the
  package of Yellow Cake Mix: 1/4 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon ground
  cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves, and a pinch of ground allspice.
  Follow Yellow Cake directions. EXTRACT FLOVORED CAKES Replace the
  vanilla in either the Yellow or White Cake recipes with 2 to 3
  teaspoons of the extract of your choice.  You may want to add a few
  drops of food coloring for the flavors like lemon, orange, or cherry,
  etc. FRESH ORANGE CAKE Pour 1 package of Yellow Cake Mix into a bowl;
  add 2 tablespoons sugar and 1 tablespoon freshly grated orange peel
  (1 teaspoon dried). Squeeze the juice from 1 large orange and add to
  it enough water to measure 1 cup. Add this orange juice to the mix,
  beat for 2 minutes as directed previously; add 2 eggs; beat and bake
  as directed. CUPCAKES Pour cake batter into greased cupcake tins or
  tins lined with paper baking cups; fill 1/2 to 2/3 full.  Bake at 375
  degrees F. for 20 to 25 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes
  out clean. Makes about 2= dozen. NOTE: To prevent a cake from
  sticking to its pan, put the pan on a wet towel to cool as soon as
  you take it out of the oven.

  You can work out your frustrations pounding the spice mix in a mortar

  particularly harmonious... Make a lot of the paste and save it for

  Put all ingredients in a food processor, using the steel blade, and
  mix 10 minutes until you have a smooth paste.
  
  This sauce is best when used fresh, but if you want to make enough to
  keep for some weeks or months you can boil it and put in sterilised
  jars.
  
  This makes a fruity but EXTREMELY HOT chile sauce. Be careful.

      Title: YELLOW TOOR DAAL
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetables, Vegetarian, Indian
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Toor daal
           -OR- mung beans or lentils
  1 1/2 c  Water
    1/2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 ts Cumin seeds
    1/8 ts Asafetida or "hing" (opt.)
      1 sm Dry, whole red chili
      1 ts Salt
    3/4 ts Fresh green serrano chilies
           - (minced)
      2 ts Brown sugar or honey (opt.)
    1/2 ts Turmeric powder
      2 tb Tomatoes, chopped
      1 tb Fresh cilantro, chopped
           - (optional)
      1 tb Yogurt; -OR-
    1/2 ts Lemon or lime juice
 
  'Daal' refers to a variety of lentils, peas and beans that are used
  to make soups and stews also known as 'daal'. This recipe calls for
  'toor daal', split yellow pigeon peas, but you can substitute mung
  beans or red lentils. Vaghar, the method used here to saute spices in
  oil is a basic Gujarati cooking technique used in making most dishes.
  
  DIRECTIONS: =========== Cover daal with water and soak 30 minutes. If
  using a pressure cooker, reduce soaking time to 10 minutes. Discard
  soaking water in a large saucepan or pressure cooker. Cook 50 minutes
  by conventional method or 15 minutes in a pressure cooker. If using
  red lentils, cook 30 minutes by conventional method or 10 minutes in
  pressure cooker. For a souplike consistency, add 1/4 to 1/2 cup more
  water if needed. Puree daal with a handheld electric blender or in a
  food processor.
  
  Heat oil in a small skillet over medium heat.  Add cumin seeds and
  asafetida.  Cook until cumin seeds turn golden brown, about 1 minute.
  Add to the daal and bring to a boil.
  
  Stir in chilies, salt, sugar, turmeric and tomatoes. Lower heat and
  simmer uncovered 5 minutes.  Remove daal from heat. Stir in cilantro
  and yogurt or lemon juice and serve immediately.

      Title: YELLOW WATERMELON SOUP
 Categories: Appetizers, Soups & ste
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  7 1/2 lb Watermelon -- yellow-flesh,
           Chill
      1 c  Raspberries -- chilled
           Garnish options--
      3 oz Prosciutto -- thinly sliced
      1 bn Thompson seedless grapes --
           Red or green, halved
    1/4 c  Fresh mint leaves -- minced
    1/4 c  Carrot -- finely shredded
           Orange zest -- long strands
 
  Cut watermelon into pieces. Trim off rind; discard. Discard seeds. In
  batches, puree watermelon flesh in a blender or food processor or by
  hand [1].  Pour into a bowl and set aside in the refrigerator to
  chill. [2]
  
  Rinse berries, drain, then puree in a blender or processor. Rub puree
  through a strainer to collect and discard seeds. [2]
  
  Optional:  Cut prosciutto into very thin shreds. Place shreds in a
  10-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Stir often until
  prosciutto is browned and crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper
  towels until cool.
  
  ASSEMBLY -  Pour melon puree equally into 6 or 4 bowls. With a small
  spoon, dollop raspberry puree in a circle, spacing drops well apart
  and adding equally small amount to each portion. With the tip of a
  skewer or small knife, pull through the raspberry dots, drawing them
  out into swirls through yellow puree. Sprinkle with prosciutto and
  mint [3] or one-or-more of the other meatless garnishes. (Can serve
  8.)
  
  [1] The round, seedless watermelon is first available late-April.
  These and other nearly 100%-water melons liquify when processed. Test
  first: crush by hand. If the strands start to disintegrate, mash by
  hand. The soup needs some body. [2] May be chilled up to 1 day in
  advance. [3] Use a fresh herb to splash the soup with some green.
  (I've used cilantro and red seedless grapes.)

  From: David Barnett <davidb@techunix.technion.ac.il>
  
  That's interesting - I have her "Jewish Holiday Kitchen" cookbook,
  which also has a recipe for Zhug, but it was neither authentic nor
  good. The following is the translation of a recipe given to me by a
  Yemenite woman, who grows her own tiny peppers (I have no idea what
  variety, but they are much hotter than seranos). One thing the
  Yemenites do with it is make a "dipping sauce" (more of a spread,
  actually) that is eaten with bread, called Helbeh.  This is adopted
  from Joan Nathan's recipe:
  
  1. Let the fenugreek seeds soak in water for several hours or
  overnight.
  
  2. Pour off any remaining liquid, leaving a moist paste.
  
  3. Using a wooden spoon, whip in, little by little, up to 1/2 cup
  water into the paste. Then mix in the zhug, lemon juice (JN calls for
  1 tablespoon, or to taste), and the tomato (JN says to grate it, I
  just mash it up).
  
  4. Adjust seasonings to taste.  It should be very spicy. This can
  either be eaten plain with bread (I would use pita), or served with a
  meal like a chutney.

 Categories: Vegetarian, Vegetables
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 c  Dried brown lentils
      1 c  Onions, finely chopped
      2    Clove garlic, pressed
    1/4 c  Niter Kebbeh
      1 tb Berbere
      1 ts Ground cumin seeds
      1 tb Sweet Hungarian paprika
      2 c  Tomatoes, finely chopped
    1/4 c  Tomato paste
      1 c  Vegetable stock or water
      1 c  Green peas (fresh or frozen)
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  Rinse and cook the lentils.  Bring to boil in 3 cups water. Reduce
  heat to a simmer.  Simmer about 30 minutes, adding more water if
  necessary, until lentils are tender. Should make about 3 cups cooked
  lentils.
  
  Meanwhile, saute the onions and garlic in the niter kebbeh, until the
  onions are just translucent.  Add the berbere, cumin, and paprika and
  saute for a few minutes more, stirring occasionally to prevent
  burning. Mix in the chopped tomatoes and tomato paste and simmer for
  another 5 to 10 minutes.  Add 1 cup of vegetable stock or water and
  continue simmering.
  
  When the lentils are cooked, drain them and mix them into the saute
  mixture.  Add the green peas and cook for another 5 minutes. Add salt
  and pepper to taste.
  
  To serve Yemiser W'et, spread layers of injera on individual plates.
  Place some yogurt of cottage cheese alongside a serving of w'et on
  the injera and pass more injera at the table. To eat, tear off pieces
  of injera, fold it around bits of stew, and, yes, eat it with your
  fingers.

 Categories: Greek
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      1 lg Onion; finely chopped
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 kg Ground beef or lamb
    1/3 c  Short grain rice
      1    Tomato; peeled and chopped
      2 tb Chopped parsley
      1 ts Chopped dill or mint
    1/8 ts Ground cinnamon
           Freshly ground black pepper
     24    Cabbage leaves
           Salted water
      1 tb Butter
      2 c  Hot stock or water
           Salt
      1 tb Cornflour
      2    Eggs; separated
      1    Lemon (juice only)
           Chopped dill or parsley
 
  Serves: 6 Cooking time: 1 1/2 hours
  
  Gently fry onion in oil until soft.  Mix into meat with rice, tomato,
  herbs and cinnamon, seasoning to taste with salt and pepper. Divide
  into 24 portions.
  
  Blanch cabbage leaves in boiling, salted water for 5 minutes until
  softened. Drain and cut out thick centre of larger leaves (very large
  leaves may be cut in half). Place one portion of stuffing on base of
  leaf, turn up base, fold in sides and wrap firmly into a neat roll.
  Repeat with remaining ingredients.
  
  Place rolls close together, seam sides down, in a deep pan lined with
  trimmings from cabbage leaves.  Add stock or water, butter, salt and
  pepper to taste. Invert a heavy plate on top of rolls and cover pan
  tightly. Simmer gently for 1 1/2 hours.
  
  When cooked, drain off stock carefully into a small saucepan. Reduce
  to 1 1 1/2 cups over heat and thicken with cornflour mixed to a paste
  with a little cold water. Let it boil 1 minute.
  
  Beat egg whites in a bowl until stiff, add yolks and beat thoroughly.
  Gradually beat in lemon juice, then boiling stock. Return sauce to
  small pan, place over low heat and stir constantly until egg is
  cooked - do not boil.
  
  Arrange rolls on a heated serving dish and spoon some of the sauce
  over them.  Garnish with chopped dill or parsley and serve remaining
  sauce separately.   Serve with mashed potatoes.
  
  Note:  Grape vine leaves may be used instead of cabbage - about 40
  will be required since they take less filling.

 Categories: Appetizers, African, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Onions or shallots, chopped
      2 tb Cayenne
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Oil
    1/3 c  Berbere
      2 c  Chick pea flour*
           Oil for frying
 
  In a dry, heavy pot, stir the onions over low heat until browned. Add
  1/3 c water along with the cayenne, salt & oil. Simmer for 5 to 10
  minutes & then add another 2/3 c water & the berbere. Bring to a
  boil, cover & reduce heat, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, add just
  enough water to the pea flour to make a thick dough similar to that
  for rolled cookies. Try using 1/2 c water & add extra a teaspoonful
  at a time until the mixture adheres to itself to form a ball. Roll
  the dough out on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of a 1/4" &
  cut into shapes with a cookie cutter. Ethiopians make fish shapes &
  decorate them with all sorts of designs. Fry the pieces in moderately
  hot oil in a heavy skillet for 3 to 4 minutes, turning several times.
  When they are crisp & brown, cautiously spoon them into the sauce in
  the pot.  Simmer gently for 5 or 6 minutes, being careful not to
  break the shapes. Lift pieces out with a slotted spoon & drain on
  cloths. Serve with the sauce. * Also called gram or garbanzo flour,
  it is easily found in Asian foodstores.

  COLD ROAST PORK:  (Flaerskesteg)
  
  Spread thin slices of roast pork on buttered bread and decorate with
  crisp pieces of rind, slices of jellied consomme (like consomme but
  with enough gelatin added to make it hold shape) cucumber salad or
  slices of pickled gherkin and red beets or red cabbage.
  
  BOILED BREAST OF BEEF:  (Kogt Oksebryst)
  
  Spread the bread with butter and put on slices of boiled breast of
  beef. Decorate with a small pile of chopped pickles at one end and a
  pile of shredded horseradish at the other. For a center decoration
  use a slice of tomato, cut halfway through and twisted so it will
  stand upright.
  
  SMOKED SALAMI AND BOILED POTATO:  (Spegepolse med kogte Kartofler)
  
  Put slices of salami on bread spread with either butter or spiced
  pork fat.
  
  Arrange a row of slices of cold boiled potato along the center of the
  salami, and on top of them run a strip of finely cut, fresh chives.
  
  THE HANS ANDERSEN SANDWICH:  (H.  C.  Andersen Sandwich)
  
  Butter a piece of either dark or light rye bread and put two rows of
  crisp bacon on top.  Place slice liver paste across one of the rows
  and tomato slice across the other. In winter the latter may be
  substituted by tomato ketchup.  Top the tomato slices with scraped
  horseradish and a strip of jellied consomme.
  
  "THE VETERINARIANS' MIDNIGHT SNACK":  (Dyrlaegens Natmad)
  
  Spread spiced lard on a piece of dark rye bread, and put slices of
  liver paste on top.  Pieces of jellied consomme are placed over this,
  and on top pieces of slightly salted boiled veal. Decorate with cress.
  
  BLUE CHEESE AND EGG YOLK:  (Roquefort Ost med Aeggeblomme)
  
  Butter a piece of white bread and spread Danish blue cheese (or
  gorgonzola) in a ring, making a hollow in the center. When eating the
  sandwich, break the yolk and spread it across the cheese.
  
  Thin slices of radish may be used to decorate this and other kinds of
  cheese sandwiches.

      Title: YETAKELT W'ET (SPICY MIXED VEGETABLE STEW)
 Categories: Vegetarian, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Onions, finely chopped
      2    Garlic cloves, pressed
      1 tb Berbere (dry)
      1 tb Sweet Hungarian paprika
    1/4 c  Niter Kebbeh
      1 c  Green beans, cut in thirds
      1 c  Carrots, chopped
      1 c  Potatoes, cubed
      1 c  Tomatoes, chopped
    1/4 c  Tomato paste
      2 c  Vegetable stock
           Salt and pepper to taste
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley(OPT)
 
  Saute the onions, garlic, berbere, and paprika in the niter kebbeh
  for 2 minutes.  Add the beans, carrots, and potatoes and continue to
  saute for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning.
  Add the chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, and vegetable stock. Bring to
  a boil and then simmer for 15 minutes, or until all of the vegetables
  are tender. [personal comment: we simmered more like 40 minutes,
  until it eventually thickened.]
  
  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Mix in the parsley (optional).
  
  Serve with injera and yogurt or cottage cheese.

  Collective, ISBN 0-671-67989-9.
  
  Comment from book: Try making this dish and Yemiser W'et for the same
  meal. In Ethiopia, it is customary to offer several stews at one
  time, and people eat some of each kind.
  
  Comments from the Shipps: Don't stop with just two dishes, make a
  banquet. You will need several friends to help eat it all, but it
  will make for a very interesting and satisfying evening. The
  Moosewood book describes how to make a hearty vegetable stock.  We
  have found a vegetarian vegetable bouillon made by Knorr that is a
  reasonable substitute with much less effort.

      Title: YIAYIA'S DOLMADES
 Categories: Appetizers, Greek
      Yield: 30 Canaps
 
      1 lb Ground beef
      1 lg Onion; chopped
    1/2 c  Rice, white
      1    Egg
    1/2 c  Mint, dry
      1 tb Butter; softened
    1/2 bn Parsley, fresh
           Dill
      3 tb Lemon juice
           Salt
           Pepper
           ;Water, if needed

MMMMM-------------------------AVGOLEMONO------------------------------
      1    Egg
      3 tb Lemon juice
           Cornstarch
 
  This recipe contains meat and is from southern Greece (the
  Peloponysos). There is also a Greek Dolmades recipe from Asia Minor
  (Constantinople) which was 80% Greek-populated until 1920 when ethnic
  cleansing by the Turks began in earnest.  The other Greek Dolmades
  recipe is essentially seasoned rice wrapped with grape leaves and
  marinated.
  
  Knead all ingredients in a bowl.  If the consistency is too hard, add
  water, one tablespoon at a time (up to 4 T.).
  
  Grape leaves are best picked from grape vines in the spring, while
  they are still tender.  They can be washed and frozen between layers
  of waxed paper and will keep for a year. They are also available in
  jars from some fruit markets (especially ones that carry a lot of
  Greek/Italian imported foods).
  
  Depending on the size, you will need 20 to 40 grape leaves (Fila -
  pronounced FEE-lah).  Small leaves tend to be more tender.
  
  Boil grape leaves until they are soft, but not tender. The time will
  depend on the leaves.  Fresh ones will only take a minute.
  
  Fold grape leaves around small spoonfulls of meat mixture, sealing
  completely.
  
  In a large pot (preferably one with a large surface area on the
  bottom), melt 1/2 stick (4 T.) butter. Arrange rolled dolmades on
  top. Do this all at once, not as you roll them. Pour 3-4 cups water
  or chicken broth over dolmades, cover, and simmer for 2 hours.
  
  Avgolemono:  Separate egg.  Whisk egg white mixed with 1 tsp. water;
  add yolk and mix. Add corn starch (she gave no measurement) to lemon
  juice and stir; add to egg mixture. Skim broth off dolmades (it is
  now a chicken/beef broth and should be greatly reduced because of the
  rice) and add 1 T. at a time to the egg mixture, whisking well. Egg
  mixture should thicken.
  
  Remove dolmades from heat.  Arrange dolmades in a bowl for serving.
  Mix remaining broth into egg-lemon mixture. Stir well and pour over
  dolmades.

      Title: YOGHURT ICE CREAM
 Categories: Desserts, Barry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     10 fl Whole-milk plain yoghurt
      4 oz Your favourite fruit
           Sugar to taste
 
  Dissolve a little sugar in water in a saucepan and add the fruit.
  Simmer for 5 minutes until soft and then puree through a sieve. If
  you have a food processor or liquidiser don't cook the fruit - just
  whizz it to a puree, adding sugar, a teaspoon at a time, until it is
  to your taste. Beat the puree into the yoghurt, pour into a plastic
  container and put it in the freezer.
  
  When it has set, take it out, spoon it back into the the food
  processor or liquidiser and give it a quick whizz. This gets rid of
  any little particles of ice that may have formed. If you don't have a
  machine, spoon the mixture into a bowl and whisk it thoroughly. Pour
  it back into the plastic container and freeze again.
  
  When you're ready to eat it, leave it in the fridge for half an hour
  before serving.

 Categories: Dairy
      Yield: 1 Recipe

  2 2/3 c  Skim milk
      1 ts Unflavored gelatin
    1/4 c  Commercial yogurt (or 1 pkg.
           Yogurt starter)
 
  Put the milk in a 2 quart pan and sprinkle on gelatin. Let soak 5
  minutes or so then stir with a wire whisk while heating to almost
  boiling (to pasteurize).  Cool to warm. Add 1/4 cup commercial yogurt
  (unflavored) and whisk in until incorporated.  rinse out small hars
  with hot water and fill with warm yogurt mixture  (1/2 pint canning
  jars work well for this and are approximately the size of serving
  size you get in the store). Set in a warm place overnight, covered
  with a blanket.
  
  I have read that you can incubate the yogurt by pouring the yogurt
  mix into a warmed thermos bottle and letting it sit overnight.
  Personally, I use the Salton Yogurt maker that I found at the
  Salvation Army for $2.00; it works every time.

      Title: YOGURT & PUMPKIN BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------------1 1/2 LOAF------------------------------
      3 ts Red Star Active dry yeast
      3 c  Bread flour plus 4 Tb
      3 tb Wheat germ
      3 tb Powdered milk
      3 ts Gluten
      3 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Ground ginger
    3/4 ts Ground cinnamon
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Pumpkin
    1/3 c  Plain yogurt
    1/3 c  Water
    1/3 c  Raisins
    1/3 c  Chopped pecans
 
  This recipe works well in the Hitachi 101.  Other machines should make
  ingredient adjustments according to their manufacturers suggestions.
  
  Have all ingredients at room temperature.  Warm water, pumpkin, and
  yogurt in microwave for approx. 60 seconds. Because the pumpkin is
  very dense, additional heating may be necessary.
  
  Depending on humidity, an additional teaspoon or so of flour may be
  necessary. (check after 5 mins, if dough is too wet, add flour. Then
  check again after rest cycle, and kneading begins) If necessary add a
  little more flour. This dough is slightly sticky compared to some
  other breads.
  
  Add all ingredients in order recommended by manufacturer. For the
  Hitachi add the pecans and raisins about 12 mins into the mixing
  cycle. (If I wait until the beeper, they don't get mixed in too well).
  
  Set on mix cycle, and light crust.
  
  This recipe makes a dense, small loaf, with much the consistency of a
  bagel, but very good.  It is a cross between pumpkin pie and raisin
  bread.

      Title: YOGURT BRAN MUFFINS
 Categories: Quickbread
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 c  Yogurt
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
    3/4 c  Brown sugar
      1    Egg
      1 c  Natural bran
      1 c  Flour
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Berries/peaches/raisins
 
  Combine yogurt and soda.  Use a big bowl - it foams.
  
  Mix oil, sugar, eggs, and bran.  Add yogurt.
  
  Add flour, baking powder, and salt.  Fold in fruit.
  
  Raisins are good with strawberry or raspberry yogurt. Otherwise, match
  yogurt to fruit.
  
  *Note:  At work (where I got this), my boss saves up odds and ends of
  yogurt all week, and she dumps them all together to make this
  brown-looking mess of yogurt. It doesn't taste different in the
  muffins, though, and you can toss in any kind of fruit with it.

      Title: YOGURT PANCAKES
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      5 lg Eggs
  1 1/4 c  Milk
      8 oz Yogurt, plain
           -(I use Dannon and
           -Knudsen; other brands
           -might require different
           -amounts)
      4 ts Baking powder
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil (or less
           -for dieters; but use
           -at least 2 T)
  2 1/3 c  Flour, white (measure
           -carefully after sifting)
      1 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  Preheat griddle and oil very very lightly.  Separate the eggs; beat
  the yolks in a bowl big enough to hold the whole recipe. Add the
  yogurt and beat again; add the milk and oil and beat again. Rinse the
  eggbeater.
  
  In a separate bowl, mix all the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder,
  sugar and salt). Sift together. I use a flour sifter for this, but if
  you insist on measuring your flour without sifting it, then you can
  try using a wire whip to blend the dry ingredients. Using a clean
  eggbeater, beat the egg whites until they are fluffy.
  
  Dump the dry ingredient mixture into the big bowl containing the milk
  mixture, stir for about 2 seconds just to get the dry ingredients
  under the surface of the liquid, and then dump the beaten egg whites
  into the big bowl.
  
  Now beat this mixture lightly and slowly with a fork until it is more
  or less uniform. If you beat too much, or too fast, then it will get
  gummy. Don't try to get rid of lumps. Cook on the hot griddle.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Amazingly good baking-powder and yogurt pancakes -- Cooks like to
  show off by making fancy glamorous recipes to serve to their friends
  by candle light. Here is a simple ordinary recipe to serve to your
  family for breakfast in the morning.
  
  I love pancakes and I make many varieties and I am an inveterate
  experimenter. This recipe is the one I have developed over the years
  to replace buttermilk pancakes because I never have buttermilk on
  hand in the refrigerator like my grandmother did. I made this recipe
  this very morning with blueberries in it. I do have yogurt in my
  fridge, though, and the yogurt can substitute for the buttermilk.
  Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  I like to put fresh blueberries in these pancakes after I pour
  them on the griddle. Make sure that your maple syrup is hot and that
  your butter is soft. You can heat syrup in the microwave or you can
  heat it by sticking the syrup jar in a pan of boiling water.
  
  *  This same recipe also makes really good waffles if you reduce the
  milk to about 1 cup, but if you are going to make waffles, you
  shouldn't cut back on the oil. If you are dieting, stick to pancakes.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  10 minutes plus cooking time.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

      1 tb Fennel seeds
      2 tb Cornmeal

MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
      1    Egg yolk; mixed with
      1 tb Water
 
  IN A LARGE MIXING BOWL, stir the warm water and yeast together, and
  let stand for a minute or so to dissolve. Stir in the yogurt, 9-grain
  cereal, bran flakes, salt, butter, rye flour and 1 1/2 cups of the
  all-purpose flour. Beat vigorously until well blended. Add enough
  all-purpose flour to make a manageable dough, then turn out onto a
  lightly floured surface. Knead for a few minutes, then let rest for
  10 minutes. Resume kneading for a good 10 minutes, until the dough is
  elastic, sprinkling on a little more all-purpose flour as necessary
  to keep it from being too sticky. Knead in the fennel seeds. Place in
  a large greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap or a clean damp cloth,
  and let rise until double in bulk. Punch the dough down and divide
  into 3 equal parts. Roll each piece into a long round strand about
  3/4-inch thick, making them all the same length. Pinch the strands
  together at one end, and braid. When you've finished braiding, pinch
  both ends together firmly and tuck them under a bit, to give the loaf
  a neat look. Transfer to a baking sheet that's been sprinkled with
  the cornmeal, cover loosely, and let rise again until double in bulk.
  Brush with the egg-yolk mixture, and bake in a preheated 350F oven
  for 45 minutes. Remove from the sheet and cool on a rack. Makes 1 Loaf

      Title: YOGURT THINS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 85 Servings
 
      2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Oil
    1/2 c  Plain, unsweetened yogurt
 
  "The flavor of these crispy snacks varies subtly with the type of
  yogurt used. A bit of sweet jam or honey complements these somewhat
  tangy crackers. They are also excellent with almost any dip.
  
  325~ F      15 to 20 minutes
  
  Preheat the oven to 325~ F.
  
  In the food processor or in a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.
  Add the oil and mix until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the
  yogurt and blend to form a dough that will hold together in a
  cohesive ball. If necessary, add an addional Tablespoon of yogurt.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll in a rectangular shape 1/8 inch thick.
  Using a spatulay, rolling pin, or your hands, pick up the rolled
  dough and transfer it to a large baking sheet.
  
  With a sharp knife, score the surface into 2-inch squares, taking
  care not to cut all the way through the dough. Prick each square in 2
  or 3 places with the tines of a fork.
  
  Baike for 15 to 20 minutes, or until light brown. Turn over once
  during baking and pull off any individual crackers at the edges that
  are already brown. Cool on a rack. Yield: 80-85.
  
  VARIATIONS: A sweeter cracker will result by substituting sweetened
  yogurt for the plain yogurt. Lemon and berry flavors are good. If you
  use fruit-at-the-bottom yogurt, be sure to stir it first. Note that
  the color can be affected by the type of yogurt used.
  
  Substituting 1/3 cup toasted wheat germ for the same amount of flour
  lends this cracker a nutty flavor.

      2    Firm tomatoes, fine chopped
      4    Green onions, finely chopped
      2 tb Chopped fresh mint
           Salt to taste
           Fresh ground pepper to taste
           Fresh mint sprigs
 
  Heat oil in a small saucepan. Add garlic and cumin seeds and cook very
  gently 2 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.
  
  In a bowl, combine cooled garlic mixture, yogurt, paprika and stir

  chopped or grated cucumber.
  
  NOTE: Serve as an accompaniment to curries or as a tasty sauce with

      Title: YOGURT WALNUT SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Plain Yogurt, Beaten With A
           Whisk To Stiff Peaks
      2 tb Fresh Lemon Juice
      2 cl Garlic, Minced
      2 tb Walnuts, Chopped, (Or More
           To Taste)
      1 tb Fresh Mint Or Basil,
           Chopped
           Salt
           Freshly Ground Pepper
 
  The pronounced flavor of walnuts is tamed somewhat by the acidic tang
  of fresh yogurt.  Beating the yogurt, much like whipping cream, gives
  the sauce a very special texture. Serve it with poultry, salads, cold
  poached or baked fish, or with cold steamed shrimp or lobster. While
  it can be tossed with the other ingredients, it is better when it is
  spooned onto the salads by the individual diners. Prepare this
  dressing on the same day that you plan to serve it.
  
  Beat the lemon juice into the yogurt in a medium-size bowl. Fold in
  the remaining ingredients.  Refrigerate the dressing several hours,
  beating once more just before serving.
  
    A very simple recipe that I am sure that no one would have tasted
  before. Simply a grand recipe for the next dinner party. Highly
  Recommended.

 Categories: Appetizers, Dips
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Plain yogurt
      1    Garlic clove; minced
      1 ts Finely chopped oregano; -OR-
    1/4 ts -Dried oregano
    1/2 ts Chopped thyme leaves; -=OR=-
      1 pn -Dried Thyme
           Freshly ground pepper

MMMMM------------------------THE EGGPLANT-----------------------------
    1/2 lb Japanese eggplants; -=OR=-
      1 md -Firm shiny eggplant
      1 lg Garlic clove; thinly sliced
      1    Bay leaf
           Thyme branches, if available
      1 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
           - or more to taste
           Lemon juice
           -=OR=- Red Wine Vinegar
           Salt
           Coarsely ground pepper
           Fresh herbs for garnish
 
  PREHEAT OVER TO 400F. Combine the first 5 ingredients in a bowl and
  set aside. Cut 5-or-6 long slits in the eggplant (fewer if you're
  using Japanese eggplants) and place a slice of garlic into each slit.
  Wrap the eggplant, together with the bay leaf and thyme branches,
  tightly in foil and bake until completely soft all over--45
  minutes-to-1 1/2 hours, depending on the size of the eggplant. If
  you're using the large eggplant, turn it over after 45 minutes and
  continue baking until soft to the touch and tender at the stem end.
  When done, remove eggplant from the oven, open the package and let
  sit for 5 minutes or so. Discard any liquid. When the eggplant is
  cool enough to handle, scrape the flesh away from the skin, put it
  into a food processor and add the yogurt mixture and the olive oil.
  Process until smooth, but leave a little texture. Stir in the lemon
  juice or vinegar to taste and season with salt. Turn the puree into a
  serving bowl and season with pepper and fresh herbs, such as thyme
  leaves and blossoms, marjoram or oregano. If those herbs aren't
  available, use some chopped parsley or scallions. Serve the spread at
  room temperature with crackers, pita bread or bread toasted and
  brushed with olive oil.

MMMMM------------------VULCAN CRACKED WHEAT AND-----------------------

MMMMM----------------------VEGETABLE SALAD---------------------------
           -Jo Ferry cmsj69b
      2 c  Water
      1 c  Cracked quadrotriticale**
      1    Cucumber; medium
      6    Green onions
      2    Tomatoes
    1/2 c  Parsley; finely chopped
     12    Fresh mint leaves  OR
    1/2    Green pepper; chopped
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
      4 tb Lemon juice  OR
      3 tb Wine Vinegar
    1/3 c  Olive oil
 
  **bulgur cracked wheat may be substituted.
    Bring 2 cups water to a boil in the saucepan and slowly pour in the
  quadrotriticale (or bulgur) so that the water keeps on boiling.
  Reduce the heat and simmer with the lid on for about 10 minutes, or
  until the water is all absorbed. Then take off the lid and cook for a
  few minutes more, stirring constantly, to dry it out a bit. Spread it
  on the sides and bottom of a large salad bowl so it can cool more
  quickly and put it in the refrigerator to chill it.
    Meanwhile peel and dice the cucumber, discarding the seeded center
  part if it is not firm. Clean and slice the green onions into 1/8"
  pieces, including abut 3" of the green tops. Cut the core out of the
  tomatoes and cut them into 1/2" chunks. Wash and chop the parsley.
  Chop the mint or the pepper, if you are using one of them.
    When the wheat is cool, break it up with a fork until it is loose
  and there are no chunks more than 1/2" in size. Add the vegetables to
  it and mix, then add the salt and pepper, lemon juice (or vinegar),
  and the olive oil. Mix again thoroughly.
    Note: It is traditional to add mint or green pepper to only a part
  of the salad when the host is not sure of all his guests' preferences.

  1 1/2 c  Water, boiling
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Parsley, chopped (packed)
    1/2 c  Green onions, chopped
      1 ts Garlic, crushed (heaping)
    1/4 c  Olive oil (little less)
    1/4 c  Lemon juice (little less)
    1/4 c  Feta cheese (1/3 pound)
           Tomatoes, chopped
           Garbanzos, to taste
 
  Cover bulghur with boiling water.  Cover, let sit about 30 minutes
  till all the water is gone.
  
  Add salt, parsley, green onions (and/or scallions), garlic, lemon
  juice and olive oil.  Add 2-3 large tomatoes and garbanzos. Top with
  1/4 C feta.
  
  Vicki's notes:
  
  *  Bulghur is cracked wheat.  You can find it at health-food stores.
  You can also find it in some grocery stores by other grains and pasta.
  
  *  Can substitute scallions for some of the green onions. Some people
  like to use mint instead of (or in addition to) the parsley. If you
  use mint, might want to add chopped cucumber instead of tomato. Can
  also add sliced avocado.
  
  *  Some recipes call for soaking bulghur in more water and wringing
  it out, but this leaves too much water!

      1 ts Peppercorns, black
      1 x  Vinegar
      1 x  Water
      1 x  Salt & pepper
 
  *** My notes: I used red wine vinegar and marinated the meat in the
  refrigerator for a little over 24 hours. I added a little red wine
  when making the gravy. Rub the meat thoroughly with the salt and
  pepper and put in an earthen dish. Add the onion, bay leaves and
  peppercorns. Take equal parts of vinegar and water and pour over the
  meat. Let stand in this liquid for 24 hours. Put meat in a roasting
  pan and sear well in oven at 400-F. When well browned, add a little
  of the spiced vinegar. Cover pan tightly and cook slowly for 3-1/2
  hours or until meat is tender. Add more of the vinegar if necessary.
  When cooked, remove meat to a platter and thicken liquid with 1 Tbsp

  Parkin is a variety of gingerbread, good warming stuff to eat out of
  doors in cold weather. When I was a child, it was always a firm
  favourite for the firework party on Bonfire Night each year. This is
  adapted from my mother's recipe.
  
  Method:
  
  Prepare 2 1-lb loaf tins, or an 9x9 inch square tin, by spraying with
  Pam. Set the oven at 350 deg F (gas mark 4).
  
  In a large bowl, mix together the oatmeal, flour, baking powder,
  ginger, and salt. In a small bowl or saucepan, mix together the apple
  sauce, sugar, treacle, syrup, and milk, and warm slightly to dissolve
  the sugar. Add these to the oatmeal mixture along with the egg white,
  and mix together to make a soft mixture of a slow-pouring
  consistency, adding extra milk if necessary. Bake for 40-50 minutes,
  or until the top springs back when pressed lightly with a finger.
  
  After it has cooled a bit, but before it gets cold, cut it into 2-inch
  squares in the tin. Cool the pieces on a wire rack, and store them in
  an airtight container.
  
  It tastes better if it is stored for 2-3 days before eating.

      Title: YORKSHIRE PORK CHOPS
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Lg golden delicious apple
      4 tb Olive oil
      4    Pork loin chops - 1-1/2 to 2
      1 c  Milk
      3    Eggs
      1 c  Flour
      2 tb Melted butter
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  (Serve with warm applesauce.. OPTIONAL) Peel and slice the apple into
  4 thick rings.  Melt the oil in an oven-proof pan, and brown them for
  about 1 minute on each side. Put an apple ring on each chop. Whisk
  the milk, eggs, flour butter and salt until well mixed. Pour the
  batter over the chops and bake for about 35 minutes at 450~ or until
  the batter is browned and puffy. Serve immediately - with the warm
  applesauce. Since the Yorkshire batter bakes with the pork chops, it
  swells up and around the chops and becomes crisp on top, but stays
  soft and moist inside - like you think of yorkshire pudding.  If you
  use thin chops they will tend to become dry and tough, so best use
  thick ones for this recipe.

      Title: YORKSHIRE PUDDING 2
 Categories: Quickbreads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2    Eggs
      1 c  Milk
      1 c  Sifted flour
    1/2 ts Salt
           Beef Drippings
 
  I find it best to mix this well in advance and chill it before
  cooking.
  
  Beat the eggs and milk together. Sift the flour and salt into the egg
  mixture and beat until well blended.
  
  Heat the oven to 450 F. Pour about 1/4 c of beef drippings into and
  11 x 7 inch backing pan or muffin tin and heat the drippings until
  they begin to smoke. Pour in the batter and place in the oven for 10
  minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 F and bake for a further 15
  minutes.
  
  This is about enough for four normal people although I could eat half
  of this myself.
  
  I find that opening the oven door during the baking can produce
  disappointing results so I don't. From: David Gibbons Converted by

 Categories: Vegetables, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     16 sm Artichokes, or
      6 md Artichokes
      2    To 2 1/2 pounds young fava
           -beans, shelled
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      6    Garlic cloves, peeled,
           -minced
      2 tb Chopped fresh winter savory
      2 tb Chopped fresh thyme
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
 
  At no other time of year can this dish be replicated successfully++-
  it epitomizes the tastes of late spring in Provence. Straight from
  the garden or the open market come either the small, violet
  artichokes or burgeoning green ones, along with pods of favas barely
  swollen with soft, tender beans.  Winter savory, which grows wild on
  the hillsides, has just put forth its new spring flush and is full of
  resinous flavor. Serve with the freshest, crustiest bread possible
  for sopping up the juices.
  
  Prepare artichokes (see below), then cut small ones in half, larger
  ones into quarters or sixths; pat dry. Remove the skins from the
  shelled favas.
  
  Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium high heat. Add garlic and
  artichoke pieces; saute, stirring frequently, for 4 or 5 minutes. Add
  the fava beans and continue to cook, stirring often, for 10 minutes.
  The artichokes will begin to change color to a deep olive green, but
  the favas will stay bright green.
  
  Add the winter savory, thyme, salt and pepper.  Stir well, reduce
  heat to very low, cover, and simmer until the artichokes are tender,
  about 15 to 20 minutes.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.
  
  PER SERVING:  275 calories, 7 g protein, 24 g carbohydrate, 19 g fat
  (3 g saturated), 0 mg cholesterol, 263 mg sodium, 9 g fiber.
  
  GENERAL PREPARATION OF ARTICHOKES:
  
  Using kitchen shears, cut off the tops (with their sharp spikes) of
  the side and bottom leaves.  Trim the base of the artichoke.
  
  Using a large, sharp chef's knife, cut off the top inch of the
  artichoke.
  
  Unless you are going to stuff the artichoke, cut it in half
  lengthwise. With the edge of a small sharp spoon or with a small,
  sharp knife, scoop out the exposed thistle. If you are going to stuff
  it, however, do not cut in half; carefully scoop out the center
  leaves along with the thistle.
  
  Put the fresh-trimmed artichokes in acidulated water until ready to
  proceed with recipe.

      Title: YOUNG JEWEL FRIED RICE (YEUNG CHAU CHOW FAAN)
 Categories: Chinese, Rice
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 c  Hot cooked rice
      1 c  Diced roast pork
      1 c  Diced cooked shrimp
      1 c  Diced cooked chicken
      2 c  Fresh bean sprouts
      2    Scallions, chopped,
           -including green ends
      1 c  Shredded lettuce
      2    Eggs, slightly stirred
    1/4 ts Ground pepper
      1 ts M.s.g.
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
 
  Add, subtract, substitute to your heart's content.
  
  Mix together pepper, m.s.g. and soy sauce and set aside.
  
  Heat wok or frying pan hot and dry.  Add one half of the oil. Turn
  heat to medium.  Add the eggs, and stir lightly so the whites and
  yolks are mixed slightly. Remove from pan while still a little soft,
  and put aside.
  
  Turn up heat; add remainder of oil and add the meats, bean sprouts and
  scallions.  Stir fry for 2 minutes. Add the hot rice. Pour soy sauce
  mixture and mix thoroughly. Put back the scrambled eggs. Turn off
  heat and add the lettuce.  Stir and serve.
  
  Substitutions and Variations:  The fresh bean sprouts may not be
  obtainable in your area.  You may leave them out of the recipe and
  increase the amount of shredded lettuce to 2 cups. A small green
  pepper, halved and finely diced is also a good substitute for the
  bean sprouts, and will brighten the color.

    1/2 bn Cilantro, leaves only

      1    Lime or lemon, cut in half

           Crisp fried shrimp chips
           -or:
           Fried rice stick noodles,
           -for garnish
           MARINADE:
    1/2 tb Vegetable oil
    1/2 tb Asian sesame oil
    1/4 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts White pepper
    1/8 ts Five-spice powder
           Juice of 1 lemon
 
  * (about 6 x 2 x 1/2-inch piece)
  
  The quality and freshness of the fish is crucial for the success of
  the dish.  Purchase the fish from a Japanese fish shop that
  specializes in sashimi, or a reliable fishmonger. To facilitate the
  very fine shredding of the radish and carrot, use a mandolin or the
  fine shredding disc of a food processor.
  
  Chill fish until firm.  Cut into paper-thin, 2-inch-long slices
  against the grain; set aside.
  
  In separate bowls, cover radishes and carrots with cold water; set
  aside until ready to assemble salad. Then rinse and squeeze out
  excess water.
  
  To assemble:  Toss fish slices with marinade ingredients. Place fish
  in center of a platter. Arrange daikon and carrot shreds around fish.
  Scatter fresh and pickled ginger, the pickled scallions, lime leaves,
  chiles, green onions and cilantro over fish. Sprinkle with peanuts
  and sesame seeds.
  
  Just before serving, squeeze the lime or lemon juice over all. It is
  customary for everyone to join in and toss the salad. Using
  chopsticks, each diner digs from the bottom of the salad and lifts
  the ingredients to mix together.
  
  When the salad is fully tossed, taste for seasoning. Adjust with more
  sesame oil, lime juice, salt and/or some of the juices from the
  pickled vegetables.
  
  Garnish with shrimp chips or fried rice stick noodles.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.
  
  NOTE:  Bottled pickled ginger and pickled scallions may be found in
  Chinese markets.  Kaffir lime leaves may be found in Thai grocery
  stores. If kaffir leaves are not available, omit or substitute
  domestic lime leaves.

      Title: YUBA
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -====
 
  Yuba, also known as bean curd skin, is the skin that forms on soy
  milk when it is heated.  It is used in Chinese and Japanese cooking
  in a variety of [??] and main dishes and is considerred a delicacy.
  
  Ingredients and Instructions:
  
  Set up a double boiler arangement with the steaming container between
  1.5 and 3" deep and about 12" diameter. Pour soymilk into boiler to
  about 1.25" depth.  Heat to about 175F.  After a few minutes a skin
  will form across the top of the liquid.  When this skin has covered
  the whole surface, separate from the edges w/a knife blade. Carefully
  lift an edge of the skin off of the liquid and slide a chopstick
  underneath. Lift the skin off the liquid and drape the chopstick over
  something so the sheet of yuba hangs free.  After a few minutes, lay
  the sheet out onto a plate.
  
  Repeat this process until the liquid is used up, then remove from
  heat. There should be a thin film of reddish stuff on the bottom of
  the pan. This is called sweet yuba and has a distinct flavor, also
  quite yummy.
  
  As for serving, this book gives a bunch of suggestions, but I'll
  leave you w/these.  You can cut it bup and use it in stir fry, wrap
  veggies in it, roll it up and dip it in, eg. honey vinegar sauce,
  miso vinegar sauce, honey lemon sauce, wasabi shoyu sauce. Converted

  combine them with salt in a small bowl. Mince garlic finely and
  sprinkle it with some of the spice mixture. Use the back of a spoon

  garlic-spice mixture to the remaining spices in the bowl, then work
  in vinegar and flour. Scrape into a small jar, cover and let stand in
  the refrigerator for several hours or preferably overnight before

  Return-Path: <jasonber@bilbo.bio.purdue.edu> A really cool party
  drink. In a very large GLASS bottle, like the ones cheap wine come
  in, add one full bottle of vodka (absolute) of either proof. Now
  strain 6 lemons and 3 limes and add the juice (and the rines if you
  prefer) to the bottle. Now add 1 cup sugar (more or less to taste).
  Now fill the bottle with ice, wrap it in a towel, and SHAKE IT!
  That's right, shake this mixture for 1 hour. Pass it around so
  everyone gets a shake. After an hour, drink and enjoy. Tastes just
  like lemonade.

      Title: YULETIDE RING
 Categories: Main dish, Holiday, Vegetarian, Vegetables
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------FOR THE OUTER LAYER-------------------------
      2 oz Butter or vegan margarine
      1 lg Onion; chopped
  3 1/2 oz Button mushrooms
      1 ts Mixed herbs
      2    Tomatoes, fresh or canned
      5 oz Soft wholewheat breadcrumbs
      5 oz Cashew nuts; grated
      5 oz Walnuts, grated
      1 tb Marmite
      2 tb Soy sauce
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper

MMMMM----------------FOR THE ALMOND & LEMON LAYER---------------------
      2 oz Butter or vegan margarine
      1 lg Onion; chopped
      8 oz Blanched almonds
      4 oz Soft white breadcrumbs
      2    Lemons

MMMMM-------------------FOR THE MUSHROOM PATE------------------------
      1 lb Button mushrooms
      1 oz Butter
      3 oz Soft breadcrumbs
           Butter; for greasing tin

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
           Lemon and tomato slices
           Parsley sprigs
 
  (I see no reason why you can't use margarine for any instance of
  butter in this recipe.  -K.M.)
  
  First thoroughly grease a 22-23 cm (9 to 9-1/2-inch) ring mould, 1.2
  liter (2 pint) capacity with butter.
  
  Since the basis of both nut mixtures is fried onion, you can melt the
  butter for both of them in a large saucepan, add both the onions and
  fry for 10 minutes until tender but not browned. Put half the mixture
  into a bowl on one side.  To complete the dark/outer mixture, add the
  mushrooms and mixed herbs to the pan. Skin the tomatoes, if you're
  using fresh ones, chop and add to the saucepan, or just mash in the
  canned ones, without any juice.  Let this mixture cook until all the
  liquid has gone, then remove from the heat and stir in all the
  remaining ingredients, and 50 ml (2 fl oz) of the water, to make a
  medium-soft mixture.
  
  To complete the almond and lemon layer, grind the almonds and add to
  the other lot of fried onion, along with the crumbs and 200 ml (7 fl
  oz) water, and flavour with lemon rind and juice. I like this mixture
  really lemony, and use the grated rind and juice of 1-1/2 lemons; if
  that is too much for your taste, adjust the amount accordingly, and
  perhaps add a tablespoonful or two more water.  The mixture should be
  quite soft but not sloppy.
  
  To make the mushroom pate, wash the mushrooms and chop the roughly.
  Melt the butter in a large saucepan, add the mushrooms and fry them,
  without a lid on the pan ~- they will soon make a great deal of
  liquid. Continue to cook them, uncovered, until all the liquid has
  gone -- this may take as long as 30 minutes.  Then liquidize with the
  breadcrumbs and season with salt and pepper.
  
  Set the oven to 190 C/375 F/Gas Mark 5.
  
  To assemble the ring, first press the dark nut mixture into the tin,
  to cover the base and all the way up the sides to within about 5 mm
  (1/4 inch) of the top (leave this clear to allow the mixture to rise
  a bit as it cooks).  Next, put in the white mixture, over the dark
  one, to cover it. Add the mushroom pate to fill the ring. When it is
  all in, gently press the top so that it is level, about 5 mm (1/4
  inch) below the top. Cover with a piece of greased foil.
  
  When you are ready to bake the ring, put it into the oven and bake for
  1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours, or until the ring feels firm to the touch and a
  skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Let it stand for 2-3
  minutes, then loosen the edges, put a large round plate on top of it,
  and turn it upside down; hopefully it will come out in one piece.
  fill the centre with stuffing balls, decorate the top with slices of
  tomato, lemon and parsley, and serve immediately.

      Title: YUM PRA-HMIK (SQUID "SALAD")
 Categories: Appetizers, Seafood, Thailand, Salads, Upload
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Fresh Squids.
      1 tb Lemongrass, Sliced Fine.
      3 tb Lime or Lemon Juice.
      1 tb Scallions, Chopped.
    1/2 c  Mint Leaves.
      1 tb Fresh Ginger Root, Julienne.
      2 tb Onion, Chopped.
      3 tb Fish Sauce.
      1 tb Cilantro, Chopped.
     10    Crushed Hot Chili Peppers.
 
  Clean and wash the fresh squids, removing all inner matters and skin.
  Cut through the side so that the meat is in a single "sheet". Cut the
  meat into strips about 3/4" to 1" wide and 2" long. If desired, slash
  one side in a close criss-cross patterns, and the strip will curl
  into a roll upon cooking.  Place the squid pieces into a wire
  strainer with long handle.
  
  Boil a pot of water, and immerse the strainer with the squid meat
  into the boiling water to cook.  For very fresh squid, cook until the
  meat had turned opaque and heated through. For frozen, or "not so
  fresh" squid, it is advisable to cook a little longer.  Lift the
  squid out of the boiling water and let drain in the strainer.
  
  Place the well drained squid meat into a bowl and add fish sauce and
  lime or lemon juice.  Adjust tastes by adding more of either
  ingredients. The tastes should be tangy sour with sufficient salty
  tastes. Add lemongrass, ginger roots (very finely julienne), and
  chopped onions, and mix well. (Optionally, you may add dry ground hot
  chilli pepper to taste).
  
  Place on a serving platter (lined with lettuce leaves) and topped with
  chopped scallions, cilantro, mint leaves, and crushed hot chilli
  peppers.

           Light soy sauce
           Chili bean sauce
           Chopped scallions
 
  To make this soup, you can use a Yunnan ceramic steam pot, a squat,
  rounded lidded vessel with an internal spout that allows steam to
  circulate but not escape. A heat-proof casserole works almost as well.
  
  BLANCH THE CHICKEN for 3 minutes in a large pot of boiling water.
  Remove the chicken and rinse thoroughly in cold running water. Place
  the chicken pieces around the Yunnan pot or on a rack set into a
  heat-proof casserole. Sprinkle the chicken with the salt, and scatter
  the ginger pieces and scallions over the top. Pour in the chicken
  stock and rice wine or sherry. Cover and gently steam on stove for 2
  hours, replenishing the hot water from time to time if needed. Remove
  the ginger and scallion pieces. With a spoon, skim off all the
  surface fat. Ladle the soup into a tureen, and pass the chicken on a

                                         Approx. Cook Time: 2:30 In a
  large bowl, combine the yeast, sugar, and water and let proof. Stir
  in the milk, salt, and two tablespoons of the butter and mix well
  with a wooden spoon. Stir in three cups of the flour, one cup at a
  time, stirring well after each addition. Transfer the dough to a
  floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about eight
  minutes, adding enough of the remaining flour to prevent sticking.
  Shape the dough into a ball. Place in a buttered bowl and turn to
  coat. Cover with a tea towel and let rise in a warm, draft-free place
  until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch the dough down and
  knead briefly. Divide into sixteen parts and shape each into a ball.
  On a floured surface with a floured rolling pin, roll out one ball to
  a round about 1/16" thick. Brush generously with melted butter and
  sprinkle all over with cilantro. Fold in the edges of the round so
  they meet in the center and roll into a smooth bun between the palms
  of your hands. Repeat with the remaining balls of dough. Place the
  buns on a buttered baking sheet, brush lightly with melted butter,
  and let them rise, covered, for about 20 minutes. In a bamboo or
  metal steamer set over simmering water, steam as many buns as will
  fit without touching, partially covered, until cooked through, about
  20 minutes. Steam the rest of the buns. Serve slightly warm.

      Title: ZABAIONE MARSALA
 Categories: Italian, Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Egg yolks
    1/3 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Sweet Sicilian Marsala
           - such as Florio or
           - Pellegrino
           Cinnamon
 
  Try substituting other wines (or liqueurs) for the Marsala; a
  combination of strong coffee and brandy also makes a flavorful,
  though not traditional, Zabaione. BRING A QUART OF WATER to a simmer
  in a small saucepan. Place the egg yolks in a heat-proof bowl and
  whisk by hand until liquid. Whisk in the sugar in a stream, then the
  Marsala. Regulate the heat under the pan so that the water simmers
  gently, then place the bowl over the pan so that the bottom of the
  bowl is above the surface of the water. Whisk vigorously; the
  Zabaione will begin to absorb air fairly quickly. Continue whisking
  for a total of 4 minutes, until the Zabaione is very aerated and
  thickened. Pour into stemmed glasses, dust with a dash of cinnamon
  and serve immediately. Though not traditional, you may wish to serve
  the Zabaione cool: After whisking until thickened, continue whisking
  by hand, with a hand mixer set at medium speed, or in a heavy-duty
  mixer fitted with the whip, until the Zabaione is cool.

 Categories: New, Text, Import
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 sm Zampone sausage, about 4 to
           -5 pounds
      2 lb Russet potatoes, peeled, cut
           -in 3/4" cubes
      4 tb Melted butter
      1 c  Whole milk
           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper
    1/4 c  Balsamic vinegar
    1/4 c  Dijon mustard
    3/4 c  Extra virgin olive oil
    1/4 c  Freshly snipped chives
 
  Wash and dry the Zampone. Prick the Zampone about 20 times all over
  with a needle. Place in a pot large enough to submerge the sausage in
  water. Fill the pot with warm water and bring to just a boil. Lower
  the heat slightly, so the water remains almost boiling. Cover and
  continue cooking for 1-1/2 hours.
  
  Uncover and check the internal temperature of the sausage with a meat
  thermometer. Cook until the temperature reads 150 degrees. Turn off
  the heat and let stand.
  
  In a 12- to 14-inch non-stock saute pan, melt the butter over medium
  heat. Add the potatoes and saute slowly until lightly browned on all
  sides. Add the milk and simmer uncovered, until softened, about 10
  minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Allow to stand in a warm place.
  
  In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the mustard and vinegar.
  Slowly add the extra virgin olive oil in a thin stream, forming an
  emulsion. Stir constantly until all the oil is added. Add the snipped
  chives and check seasoning.
  
  Remove the Zampone from the water. Carefully slice half the sausage
  into 1/2-inch rounds. On a large serving platter, spread the potatoes
  around the base. Place the Zampone pieces and slices over the
  potatoes. Pour the vinaigrette into a serving pitcher, allowing each
  person to dress his or her own portion. Serve immediately.

 Categories: India, Chicken, Curries
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 kg Chicken thigh
           Cutlets or breasts,
           Whole or in fine
           Strips (4.5 lb)
           Juice of 2 lemons
      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Cayenne
      3 oz Flour
      6 oz Butter
      2    Onions, finely sliced
      2 cl Garlic, crushed
  2 1/2    Inch piece root ginger,
           Finely chopped
      2 ts Cumin seeds
    500 ml Yoghurt* (1 pint)
    150 ml Fresh cream* (or equal
           Quantity of sour light
           Cream) (1/2 cup)
      1 cn Coconut cream (if mixture
           Seems too dry through
           Prolonged cooking)
           Thinly pared rind of
           1 lemon, in 1 piece
           (ho ho ho..if you can
           Achieve this you are
           Truly exceptional)
 
  Place chicken on a large plate and rub over with lemon juice. Set
  aside for at least 20 minutes, then pat fry with kitchen paper. Mix
  salt, cayenne and flour on a plate and dredge chicken pieces, shaking
  off excess. Melt butter in pan, add the chicken and fry until
  browned. Add onions, garlic, ginger and cumin seeds and fry until
  golden brown. Stir in yoghurt, cream and lemon rind.  Return chicken
  to mixture and mix until all chicken is well coated.  Bring to the
  boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 1 hour or until chicken
  is cooked. Uncover the pan for the last 20 minutes, to allow sauce to
  reduce.  Discard lemon rind (if you can find it) before serving.
  
  I found that the mixture was too dry for the quantity of chicken, so
  I used additional yoghurt/sour cream and the coconut cream to get the
  consistency I liked. WALT

  or blender. Puree at high speed for a couple of minutes, let steep
  for 30 minutes. Then pour into a strainer set over a bowl. Press on
  the pulp and squeeze by the handful to extract as milk as possible.
  Pour the milk through a fine-mesh strainer. For dried coconut: use 1
  cup unsweetened, dried coconut with 1 1/2 c hot tap water. Allow to
  stand for 5 minutes. Puree one minute and proceed as above. Will keep
  up to three days refrigerated and indefinitely, if frozen.

      Title: ZEPPOLE
 Categories: Pastries, Ethnic
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Water +
     10 oz Sugar
      3 tb Oil
    1/2 ts Salt
      2    Bay leaves
      2 c  Sifted flour
      2 tb Semolina
      4    Egg yolks
    1/4 c  Marsala ( sweet )
           Olive oil
           Powdered sugar
 
  Zeppole comes from the word zeppelin. Zeppole means fried " puffs "
  When cooked properly they should be heavenly and so light you might
  expect them to float away. this particular version comes from Naples,
  Italy.There are many zeppole recipes, this being more of a fried puff
  pastry opposed to other zeppole which are more breadlike.
  
  Mix water, sugar, oil and bay leaf in heavy saucepan and bring to a
  boil. Mix flour and semolina together and dump into boiling water all
  at once. Remove from heat and begin stirring with wooden spoon until
  it forms a mass. Return to lowest heat and cook 5 minutes stirring.
  Remove from heat, discard bay leaf and add yolks 1 at a time beating
  vigorously after each addition. add marsala and beat dough until
  satiny. You can use a food processor to prepare this dough if you
  wish to make the above steps go faster. Grease a countertop or board
  with olive oil and pat down dough into a pancake. Flatten dough and
  fold sides over on itself so there are 3 layers. flatten dough again
  and repeat folding 5 times more. Take about 1/3 of dough and roll out
  to a thickness of your thumb and make each piece into a ring. Make 3
  or 4 at a time and slip them into boiling oil. when you turn them,
  prick them with a sharp knife or fork in a few places. Drain on brown
  paper and serve warm, dusted with confectionery sugar.

      Title: ZEPPOLI
 Categories: Desserts, Italian
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter
      1 pn Salt
      1 c  Flour
      3    Eggs, whole
      1    Egg yolk
           Vegetable oil
           - for deep frying
    1/2 c  Confectioners' sugar
 
  As made in Naples for the Feast of San Giuseppe, these crullers are
  piped from a pastry bag into ring shapes. After being fried, their
  centers are filled with pastry cream and cherry preserves. PUT BUTTER
  AND SALT into a saucepan with 1 cup water. Boil until butter
  dissolves. Off heat, dump in flour all at once and stir rapidly to
  mix. Return pan to medium-high heat and cook, still stirring rapidly,
  until mixture is smooth and begins to coat bottom and sides of pan.
  Remove pan from heat and, one at a time, add eggs and extra yolk,
  stirring briskly until each addition is absorbed. Let mixture cool to
  room temperature. Put confectioners' sugar into a brown paper bag.
  Heat deep-frying oil to 375F. Using 2 teaspoons, drop in nuggets of
  dough about the size of a small walnut. Fry a few at a time for
  5-to-6 minutes each. As they cook, the zeppoli will rise to the
  surface, turn over when their bottom halves are golden brown, and
  finally rupture slightly and puff further as the interior dough
  expands. Remove them from the oil when golden brown, firm, and hollow
  inside. (Check one from the first batch, and if the interior is at
  all soggy, cook the rest longer.) Drain zeppoli briefly on paper
  towels, then toss in the bag with confectioners' sugar. Serve at once.

      2    Bay leaves
    1/2 ts Ground tumeric

      2 ts Jalapenos; seeded & chopped
      4 tb Black mustard seeds; ground*
      3 tb -Water
      3 oz Coconut, shredded sweetened
      1 pn Soy margarine (optional)

MMMMM------------------------FOR GARNISH-----------------------------
           Cilantro, chopped (optional)
 
  *If black mustard seeds are not available, use 1 Tbs dry mustard.
  
  Mix ground mustard powder in with water and allow to sit for 30
  minutes.
  
  Bring split peas and water to a boil.  Lower heat to medium. Add bay
  leaves and tumeric (I forgot the tumeric--was good anyway). Simmer,
  covered, until peas are done, 40 to 45 minutes. (When pressed between
  the thumb and the index finger, they break easily.) While simmering,
  uncover occasionally and stir, adding a Tbs or so of hot water if the
  mixture sticks to the bottom of the pan.  When cooked, remove and
  discard bay leaves. Add salt and keep warm.  Heat oil in a small,
  6-inch skillet over medium-low heat. Saute ginger root and jalape o
  until ginger is lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Add mustard paste
  and cook for another minute, stirring constantly. Add coconut and
  stir several times. Remove from heat. Pour over the pea mixture and
  stir. (I had to drain my peas, because I still had lots of water in
  mine.)  Let stand covered for 15 minutes. Add a dab of soy margarine
  if desired and garnish with cilantro. (I didn't use the cilantro)
  
  I think this would make a good filling for pita pockets. I didn't
  think the peas were "zesty" enough, so I sprinkled hot pepper vinegar
  on mine.

      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      1 pk (2-1/4 teaspoons) active

      2 tb Molasses
    1/4 c  Warm water
      1 ts Orange zest (approx. 1/2
           Medium orange)
      1 ts Lemon zest (approx. 1/2
           Medium lemon)
  1 1/2 c  Rye flour
  1 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Baking soda
      1 tb Dried rosemary, OR
      3 tb Fresh rosemary, finely
           Chopped
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1    Egg
    1/2 c  Orange juice, fresh or
           Reconstituted
           Cornmeal to sprinkle on the
           Baking sheeet
      1    Egg, lightly beaten with 1
           Tablespoon water
    1/8 ts Salt, for glazing the tops
           Coarse salt for the tops
 
  "The citrus zest undertone of these versatile bread sticks marries
  well with the rosemary and molasses to produce an intriguing addition
  to a picnic basket or a formal dinner. 325~F. 30 to 35 minutes
  Preheat the oven to 325~F.
  
  In a small bowl, combine the yeast with the molasses and warm water.
  Set aside in a warm place until the yeast starts to foam, about 5 to
  10 minutes. Prepare the zest by lightly grating the outer peel of the
  orange and lemon against the fine grate of a cheese grater. Use only
  the colored part of the rind; the underlying white portion is bitter.
  
  In a large bowl or in the food processor, combine the flours, salt,
  and baking soda. Stir in the orange zest, lemon zest, and rosemary
  and mix well. Add the oil, egg, and orange juice and mix well. Add
  the yeast mixture and mix until well blended.
  
  Knead well by hand for about 5 minutes on a lightly floured surface
  until the dough is smooth and springy to the touch. Place the dough
  in a large, lightly oiled bowl and turn over to coat all sides. Cover
  with a damp towel and set in a warm place until the dough has doubled
  in bulk, about 1-1/2 to 2 hours.
  
  Punch the dough down and turn out onto a lightly floured surface or
  pastry cloth. With a sharp knife, divide the dough into 12 small
  pieces. With your hands, roll each piece into a stick approximately
  12 inches long. You will have a more even-looking stick if you place
  the dough on a firm surface and roll your hands across the top,
  moving from the center outward.
  
  Place the sticks 1 inch apart on a baking sheet that has been lightly
  sprinkled with cornmeal. Cover the sheet with a towel and let the
  sticks rise slightly in a warm place for 10 to 15 minutes.
  
  Brush the tops of the sticks with the lightly beaten egg mixture and
  sprinkle with coarse salt. If desired, sprinkle with chopped rosemary
  for additional flavor. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until well
  browned.
  
  Cool on a rack. Yield: 12.

 Categories: Salads, Swiss, Potatoes, Vegetables
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 c  Beef stock
      1 c  Chicken stock
  3 3/4 lb Mealy potatoes
    1/2 oz Fresh parsley
           Small onion
    1/2 c  Salad dressing
 
  (The Zeughauskeller is a big, cheerful restaurant in Zuerich which
  specializes in sausages, as well as serving steak, chicken, fish, and
  very good beer and Swiss wine, in an atmosphere of relaxed history
  [the restaurant building used to be the town armory, and working
  weapons still hang on the walls].  The following recipe is for their
  potato salad. They go through twenty metric tons of it per year.)
  
  (This recipe is an early approximation of the original recipe. All
  amounts have been converted from the original metric, and reduced.) .
  Salad dressing:  About 1/2 C of a good mayonnaise, the fresher the
  better -- I think the Zeughauskeller makes their own fresh, every day
  ~- mixed to taste with German-style mustard (i.e. a sharp yellow
  mustard rather than a brown one).
  
  Every utensil must be scrupulously clean, then scalded, including
  pans. ~- Peel and cut up potatoes. Cook until "almost ready", then
  drain (trying to retain starch).  Put in pan.  -- Pour BOILING stock
  over potatoes to bring out the starch and bind the potatoes together.
  Let sit 45 minutes to absorb.  -- Chop parsley and onions (to taste)
  by hand. Add to potatoes, toss;  let sit in hot mixture to add
  flavor. ~- Pour salad dressing over salad:  toss.

 Categories: Sauces, Seasonings
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
           Small green chili peppers
           ;(I used abt. 30 jalapenos)
      1 c  Chopped parsley
           -- about 1/2 bunch
           -- including stems
      1 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
           -- including stems
  1 1/2 tb Garlic; minced
           -- (abt. 12 large cloves)
      1 ts Each salt and pepper
      1 ts Ground cumin
      2 tb Olive oil
 
  In blender, puree enough chili peppers to measure one cup when done.
  Puree parsley & cilantro together; blend well w/the pureed chili
  peppers. Add garlic, seasonings & olive oil. Again blend well.
  
  Store zhoug, refrigerated.  Will remain fresh for many months.
  
  Yield:  1 1/2 cups.
  
  The authors write: "Spicy zhoug is a source of pride among the
  Yemenite population.  Made with the sharpest of chili peppers, it is
  eaten with classically oriental Jewish meals.
  
  "More than just a condiment, zhoug is a tradition. Yemenites believe
  that daily consumption of zhoug wards off disease and strengthens the
  heart. Zhoug can be an addition to salads and a sauce for various
  kinds of meat, fish, and poultry dishes."
  
  Caution:  While quite hot, this stuff is addictive! It's excellent
  slathered on Saltines and accompanied by a cold brewski. I've seen
  people go through entire containers of zhoug, which was nicknamed
  "Truth or Dare" here to separate the wheat from the chaff as far as
  heat lovers go.

      1 ts Cornstarch
      1 ea Kamaboko; (fish or ham gelat
      1 ea Carrot
      3 ea Oriental Taro

     12 ea Mochi (rice cake)
      6 c  Dashi
      1 tb Shoyu
 
  C       T  salt Gail some time ago you requested some information
  about Ozoni the Japanese National Dish for New Years. There are
  probably as many recipes for Zoni as there are cooks busy preparing
  the dish but they are all fairly similar. Slice the chicken very thin
  and sprinkle with the cornstarch. Then pound the chicken with the
  back of a knife to enlarge the pieces. Boil in water for 5 minutes
  Slice the Kamaboko into 6 pieces 1/4 inch thick Slice the carrot into
  thin slices and after peeling the taro slice them into thin round
  slices. Boil the carrots and taro in 1/2 C of dashi. When soft add
  1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp shoyu. Boil the spinach or watercress in hot
  water being sure to remove them from the boiling water when still
  very green. Cut the greens into 1 inch lengths. Slice the Yazu into
  thin strips to represent pine needles. Toast the Rice cakes. Boil 6
  cups of dashi and flavor with the 1 tbs. salt and the 1 Tbs. shoyu.
  Add the Kamaboko, carrots , taro and the greens. Place two pieces of
  the toasted Mochi, two slices of the chicken, 1 slice of the carrot,
  2 slices of taro, 1 slice of the kamaboko and a little of the greens
  in each of six bowls Pour the hot soup over them and then float the
  yazu needles on the top. Naturally any good Japanese family in Japan
  would have had a drink of the special TOSO wine prior to the Zoni.
  With the master of the house drinking first, then the mistress
  followed by the children and the the servants last. This wine laced
  with medicinal herbs and spices is believed to have disease
  dispelling qualities and is similar to the wines served on New Years
  by several other countries in the world. Fuku-cha is another
  manditory item in their New Years (it is the tea of Good fortune) and
  can either be green tea or seaweed tea which is served in tiny cups
  with a pickled plum in each of the cups as a protection from illness
  during the coming year. These formal ritualistic observances of the
  New Year are becomming less common throughout Japan now that they
  have had so much of the Western influence however in the rural areas
  they are still followed religiously. It is a shame to see some of
  these interesting observences gradually disappearing due to the
  influence of the western world.

 Categories: Digest, Nov.
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 tb Apple juice
      1    Onion, diced
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
      4    Zucchini, sliced
      1 c  Peeled and chopped mild
           Green chile peppers
      6 c  Vegetable broth
 
  4 cups cooked yellow hominy (or 2 16-oz. cans) 1 teaspoon ground
  cumin 2 Tablespoons fresh chopped cilantro
  
  Saute the onion and garlic in apple juice for 3-5 minutes. Add
  zucchini and green chiles and cook over medium heat, stirring
  occasionally, another five minutes.  Add broth, hominy, and cumin and
  simmer, covered, over low heat for 45 minutes. Stir in cilantro and
  serve.
  
  This is a vegetarian version of posole, a dish made by Pueblos and
  Hispanics for feast days and special celebrations. Serve it with sage
  breadsticks.  Hominy is a flavorful, chewy type of corn kernel that is
  treated with lime and dried. It is available either canned, frozen, or
  dried. A mail-order source for hominy is Los Chileros de Nuevo
  Mexico, PO Box 6215, Santa Fe, NM 87502; (505) 471-6967. You can
  substitute frozen corn kernels for an even more colorful soup.

  minutes, until crumbs are lightly browned.
  
  Note: Can be done in one step, but squash may not be soft when done.
  Great for a show, if they are the Zucchini type. Posted by Sarah

      Title: ZUCCHINI & WALNUT CAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Walnut pieces
      2 md Zucchini, unpeeled, ends
           -trimmed
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
    1/4 c  Brown rice flour
      1 ts Baking powder
      1 pn Salt
      3 lg Eggs
    3/4 c  Sugar
      2 tb Diced candied lemon peel,
           -finely minced
 
  Powdered sugar
  
  Preheat oven to 350F.  Butter the sides of an 8 x 2-inch cake pan,
  line the base with a circle of baking parchment and butter the
  parchment. Using a nut mill, grind walnuts to flour and set aside.
  Using the same nut mill, grind zucchini into fine shreds.  There
  should be 1 cup, firmly packed, or 6 ounces.  Place in a sieve and
  press out the liquid. Combine cornstarch, rice flour, baking powder
  and salt; set aside.
  
  Beat eggs with sugar until lemon-colored and very thick. A lifted
  beater should leave a slowly dissolving trail of batter. Using a
  large rubber spatula, lightly fold in grated walnuts and minced lemon
  peel, as though mixing a souffle.  Fluff up zucchini shreds and fold
  in. Sift cornstarch-flour mixture over batter and quickly fold in,
  retaining as much volume as possible.
  
  Pour into prepared pan (the batter will be loose) and bake for 40
  minutes, until a tester comes out dry. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes
  before unmolding onto a rack. Peel off paper, reverse onto rack right
  side up, and let cool completely.
  
  Dust with powdered sugar before serving.
  
  Serves 8.

      Title: ZUCCHINI BLOSSOMS~ CRETAN STYLE
 Categories: Greek, Appetizers, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
     30    Zucchini blossoms
      3 tb Olive oil
      4    Scallions, minced
      1    Garlic clove; minced
    1/3 c  Raw long grain rice
    1/2 c  Canned tomatoes; drained
      3 tb Chopped parsley
      3 tb Chopped fresh mint or dill
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
    1/2 ts Granulated sugar
 
  Soak the stems in cold water overnight, without soaking the blossoms.
  The following day, wash and drain on a towel. Cut off and discard the
  stems without breaking the blossoms, and set the blossoms aside while
  you make the filling.  Heat the oil and saute' the scallions until
  soft. Add the garlic and rice and cook over moderate heat for 2
  minutes stirring constantly with a wooden spoon.  Stir in the
  tomatoes, herbs, and enough water to cover the rice, then season with
  salt and pepper and the sugar. Simmer for 5 minutes, and remove from
  the heat. Using a teaspoon, stuff each blossom carefully, holding it
  in the palm of one hand, then close it and lay it on its side in a
  buttered flameproof casserole large enough to accomodate all the
  blossoms.  Continue until all are filled. Pour 1 cup of warm water
  into the casserole. Invert a plate over the flowers, then cover the
  casserole and simmer over lowest heat about 1-1/2 hours. Check every
  30 minutes to see if more water is needed; if so, add warm water (it
  should all be absorbed when cooked). Serve with poultry, meat or fish
  dishes, or as a delightful first course.  From: "The Food of Greece"

  from Margaret Garmon of Cumberland County, Ky., where Ralph and his
  wife Edith lived all of their lives until moving to Hodgenville in
  April 1993. Mary L. Harmon, my cleaning lady, said it was the best
  zucchini bread she'd ever had. Ralph frosted it with the penuche

      Title: ZUCCHINI BREAD BAKED IN A JAR
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Baking soda
      2 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
      2 c  Sugar
      3 lg Eggs
      1 c  OIL
      2 c  Zucchini, grated
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Pecans, chopped
 
  Sterilize 8 Ball Quilted Crystal (#14400-81400) jam/jelly canning
  jars, lids and rings by boiling them for 15 minutes. Remove the jars
  from the water and allow them to air dry; leave the lids and rings in
  the hot water until you're ready to use them--the rings MUST be hot
  when used. If you can find them, you can also use 4 (1-1/2 pint)
  straight-sided jars. They must NOT have buldges in the sides of the
  jars or you won't be able to get the cakes out without digging them
  out. Look for the number of the jar I've given you--once you see what
  they look like, you'll know what to look for. Once the jars are cool
  enough to handle, grease them with shortening (DO NOT use butter,
  margarine, PAM or Baker's Secret). Fill jars 1/2 full; place onto a
  cookie sheet.
  
  Preheat oven to 325-degrees (NO HIGHER!)
  
  Sift together the flour, salt, baking powder baking soda, cinnamon and
  cloves; set aside.
  
  Beat eggs until foamy.  Add sugar, oil, zucchini and vanilla. Mix
  well with beater. Add flour mixture to zucchini mixture. Add nuts.
  
  For the pint jars, bake for about 35 minutes, moving the jars around
  in the oven so they'll bake evenly. Start checking the cakes at 25
  minutes, and go from there. The bread needs to be done, but not
  over-done. For the 1-1/2 pint jars, bake for about 1 hour and 15
  minutes; start checking them at 1 hour and go from there.
  
  Using HEAVY DUTY MITTS (the jars ARE HOT!), remove the jars from the
  oven one-at-a-time. Place a lid, then a ring on top and screw down
  tightly. Place jars onto your counter top to cool completely. You'll
  know when they've sealed, you'll hear a "plinking" sound. In case you
  don't hear it, double- check the jars by pushing down in the middle
  of the lids once the jars have sealed--they shouldn't move at all.

  until cake is moist but not wet. Cool completely. Drizzle icing over
  cake and sprinkle with almonds
  
  Icing:  combine powdered sugar, cinnamon, orange juice and liqueur in
  bowl. Mix til smooth.  Use immediately.
  
  Orange Glaze: Stir together til smooth.
  
  Note: Avoid using dry old dates. For slightly softer cake texture,
  add 2 Tbsp melted butter to batter before folding into squash. This
  will add 2 grams fat per serving. From: The Spectator....Aug 12/92
  There is yellow squash hidden in this cake, but you'd never guess it.
  It's delicate, faintly sweet flavor blends right in. You can use
  crook neck, straight neck or even yellow zucchini, but be sure to
  select young squach with soft, thin skins. (why not green zucchini?)
  This cake, with its accent of chopped dates, needs only a simple
  icing to dress it up To add extra moistness and a sweet citrus
  flavour, poke all over the warm cake and pour optional glaze over the
  cake til it soaks in.
  
  Adapted from a rich recipe with sour cream and pecans created by the
  late Bert Greene.

      Title: ZUCCHINI DILL PICKLES
 Categories: Condiments, Vegetables, Preserves, Relishes
      Yield: 4 Pints
 
      2 lb Small zucchini
      2 md Onions
    1/4 c  Kosher salt
           Ice water
      2 c  Cider vinegar
      2 c  Water
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Mustard seed
      4 ea Dill heads -=OR=-
    1/4 c  -Dill seed
      4 ea Garlic cloves (or more)
           -- sliced thin
      1 bn Dill leaves
           -- large stems removed
 
  Small zucchini (about 1 inch in diameter) make the best pickles, but
  over-grown ones can make satisfactory pickles if they are halved,
  seeded, then cut into half-rings. I prefer to use the dill heads
  before they are completely mature and dry because of their soft
  flavor and appearance. Trim the ends from the zucchini and slice
  about 3/8 inch thick. Halve the onions lengthwise, then slice them
  crosswise about 1/4 inch thick. Layer the vegetables in a glass,
  ceramic, or stainless steel bowl, sprinkling each layer with salt.
  Cover with ice water. Place a plate on top of the vegetables and a
  weight on the plate. Let stand for 2 hours. Drain the zucchini and
  onions and rinse well.  Drain again while you prepare the pickling
  liquid. Mix the vinegar, water, sugar, and mustard in a large
  nonreactive pan. Bring the mixture to a boil, then simmer for 5
  minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, add the dill heads or seed and
  the zucchini and onions, and cover. Let the mixture stand for 2
  hours, tossing occasionally. Meanwhile, fill a canning kettle with
  enough water to cover pint jars and bring the water to a boil.
  Sterilize four pint jars and scald four lids and rings. Bring the
  zucchini mixture to a boil in its pan and stir in the garlic and dill
  leaves. Ladle into hot, sterilized pint jars. Cover with lids and
  rings and process in the boiling water bath according to
  manufacturer's directions for 10 minutes at sea level. Store the
  pickles for a week at room temperature before using. If any jars do
  not seal, store them in the refrigerator and use the contents within
  2 weeks.

      Title: ZUCCHINI PEPPER RELISH
 Categories: Canfood, Water bath, Pickling, Typed
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 lb To 5 lb zucchini
      6 lg To 8 onions
    1/3 c  Pure granulated salt
  3 1/2 c  Vinegar
      3 c  Sugar
      1 tb Ground nutmeg
      1 tb Dry mustard
      2 ts Celery or seasoned salt
      1 ts Turmeric
      1 ea Sweet red pepper; chopped
      1 ea Green pepper; chopped
 
  Sometimes zucchini grows to gargantuan proportions; you can use up
  those squash monsters in this snappy relish. The recipe makes six 1
  pint jars. You'll need a cheesecloth lined colander or strainer and a
  food processor or grinder in addition to the basic equipment.
  
  1. Wash zucchini, peel if desired or if skin is very tough. Peel and
  cut onions into quarters.
  
  2. Put vegetables through coarse blade of food grinder or chop
  coarsely.
  
  3. In large mixing bowl, combine ground zucchini and onions with
  salt; mix well. Set aside and let stand overnight.
  
  4. Next day, organize and prepare ingredients, equipment, and work
  space.
  
  5. Drain vegetables into a cheesecloth lined colander. Rinse with cold
  water and drain again.
  
  6. In large kettle, combine all remaining ingredients and heat to
  boiling.
  
  7. Stir in zucchini and onions and heat to boiling, then reduce heat
  and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  
  8. Ladle relish into hot jars to within 1/4 inch of tops. Run a slim,
  non metal tool down along the insides of jars to release any air
  bubbles. Add additional relish, if necessary, to within 1/4 inch of
  tops.
  
  9. Wipe tops and threads of jars with a damp clean cloth.
  
  10. Put on lids and screw bands as manufacturer directs.
  
  11. Process in a boiling water bath for 20 minutes. Follow the basic
  steps for boiling water bath canning,
       10    through 19.

  Spread with tomato sauce. Add mushrooms and Mozzarella cheese on top.
  Broil again until Mozzarella is melted and bubbly.
  
  Notes:  Can also be made in a jelly roll pan I prefer just mushrooms

      1 lb Small zucchini; unpeeled

      1 lg Garlic clove; peeled

      1 tb Chopped fresh parsley
      1 ts Chopped fresh thyme
      1 ts Chopped fresh oregano
    1/4 ts Fresh rosemary; fine chopped
      2 tb Dry white wine
           Salt and pepper; to taste
 
  *Or use canned plum tomatoes.
  
  Scrub zucchini well under running cold water.  Cut off ends and cut
  into 1/4" slices.  Sprinkle with salt, toss to coat and let stand in
  a colander for 30 minutes. Rinse well in cold water, then place in a
  cloth towel and squeeze out bitter juices.  Dry well.
  
  Heat half the oil in a large, heavy skillet and lightly saute
  zucchini. Remove zucchini from pan and set aside. Discard used oil.
  Add remaining oil; heat. Add onions and gently cook, covered, over
  low heat ("sweat" the onions), just to soften.  Remove lid. Turn heat
  to medium and add garlic. Cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add tomatoes. Add
  fresh herbs and wine and the reserved, sauteed zucchini.  Cook 5 to
  10 minutes, stirring frequently. Season with salt and pepper.
  Zucchini should still have some crunch to it.
  
  To vary this, add sliced, seeded green or red peppers with the onions
  to soften, and proceed as above.
  
  Serve warm as a side dish or cold as a salad.  Use small zucchini for
  the sweetest flavor.

      Title: ZUCCHINI RICOTTA CALZONE
 Categories: Italian, Kooknet
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 tb Butter
      2 c  Zucchini, packed, grated
      2 ea Garlic cloves, minced
      1 c  Ricotta cheese
      1 c  Cheddar cheese, extra-old
           -shredded
      1 ea Egg
    1/2 ts Oregano, dried
    1/2 ts Basil
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
      1 lb Pizza dough (500g), prepared
 
  IN skillet, heat butter over medium-high heat. Add zucchini and
  garlic. Cook, stirring often, 7 to 10 minutes or until most of the
  liquid has evaporated. In a bowl, blend together zucchini mixture,
  ricotta, Cheddar, egg, oregano, basil, salt, pepper and nutmeg.
  Refrigerate while rolling out the dough.
  
  DIVIDE dough into 4 portions and shape into balls. On lightly floured
  surface, roll or stretch each ball into an 8-inch circle. Divide
  filling among dough rounds; fold dough over to make half-circles,
  leaving enough dough on the bottom edge to fold over top edge. Crimp
  edges to seal (it may be easier to fill and form soft calzone right
  on the baking sheet).
  
  BAKE on greased baking sheet in 425F oven for about 20 minutes or
  until golden brown.
  
  * Calzones are baked pizza-dough turnovers. Buy ready-to-bake pizza
    dough in plastic bags in the refrigerator or freezer sections of
  many
    supermarkets. The weight may vary -- if you have more than you need,
    cut off the extra and freeze to make pizza later. Serve calzones
  warm
    or at room temperature with a tossed salad. Submitted By SAM

      1 ts Cumin, whole
      1 tb Ginger, shredded

  1 1/2 ts Lemon juice
           Salt to taste
      1 tb Coriander (fresh),
           -chopped
 
  Heat the oil in a large frying pan over high heat for 3 minutes. Add
  the cumin, let the oil darken slightly (about 10 seconds) and add
  ginger and chili.  Cook for 30 seconds, stirring frequently.
  
  Add the zucchini and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes.  Add tomato during the
  last 2 minutes of cooking.
  
  Turn off the heat.  Sprinkle lemon juice and salt to taste, mix,
  transfer to a serving plate and garnish with coriander.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Zucchini with ginger and chili peppers -- This is a nice spicy
  vegetable dish.  It goes well with fish, especially catfish. I've
  always used zucchini, though it works as well with carrots or
  cucumbers. You can serve it as an appetizer or as a side dish, hot or
  cold. The recipe is originally from _Travel & Leisure_ magazine.
  Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  I've found that this recipe works best if you use small zucchini,
  so that each slice has some peel (skin?) attached. Center slices
  without peel/skin fall apart.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

 Categories: Vegetables, Appetizers, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 pk Frozen filo pastry
      6 md Zucchini
    1/2 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Pine nuts
      2 tb Virgin olive oil
      1 sm Red onion
           - diced into 1/4-inch pieces
           Pepper
      2    Garlic clove; minced
    1/2 c  Chopped basil
           - (loosely packed)
      3 tb Parsley, minced
    1/4 c  White wine or water
      2    Eggs
    2/3 c  Parmesan, grated
      3 oz Feta cheese, crumbled
      8 tb Unsalted butter; melted
           - (or a mixture of
           - butter and olive oil)
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Remove filo pastry from freezer and let it come
  to room temperature while you prepare the filling. Unfold the dough,
  and cut the stack of sheets in two. If you are making just one
  recipe, refold half the dough, and wrap it in plastic. It can either
  be refrozen or kept for a few days in the refrigerator. Cover the
  sheets to be used with a sheet of waxed paper covered in turn with a
  damp kitchen towel, to keep them from becoming dry and brittle. Grate
  the zucchini on the large holes of a hand grater or in a food
  processor. Toss with the salt and set aside for 30 minutes. Then
  drain and squeeze dry in a clean kitchen towel. Roast the pine nuts
  for 5-to-8 minutes in oven, chop them finely, and set them aside.
  Heat the olive oil in a large skillet and saute the onion until it
  begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the zucchini, season with
  freshly ground black pepper, and cook another 4 minutes; then add the
  garlic, basil, parsley and white wine or water. Cover for 3 to 4
  minutes, and remove from heat. Beat the eggs, stir in the cheeses,
  then cook the vegetables. Check the seasoning. Brush a
  9-by-13-by-2-inch pan with the melted butter and lay a sheet of filo
  pastry with butter, or mixture of butter and olive oil, and continue
  buttering and layering, until you have used half the sheets. Scatter
  half of the chopped pine nuts between several of the layers. Brush
  the top layer with butter and spread the filling over it. Continue
  layering the rest of the pastry sheets. If the butter begins to
  congeal, reheat it so it spreads easily. Cut the assembled pastry
  into 3-inch squares, then into diamonds, making sure you cut through
  all the layers; refrigerate the pastry if you will not be baking
  right away. Bake in a preheated 400F oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or
  until browned. Serve the pastries warm from the oven, slightly
  cooled, or at room temperature. Makes one 9-by-13-inch filo pastry.

  Wash and dry zucchini, and trim off ends.  Finely grate the unpeeled
  vegetables.  Spread on a clean dish towel and pat dry. Beat sugar and
  yolks until creamy and sugar is dissolved. Add lemon juice, lemon
  peel, salt, rum, flaked coconut, and mix well. Cut the candied
  cherries in half, or chop into smaller pieces, as desired. Add to
  mixture. Mix flour and baking powder and add it as well as the grated
  zucchini. Beat the chilled egg whites to stiff peaks and carefully
  fold into the batter. Pour into well greased 'Rehruecken' mold [I
  would also flour it, I think. K.B.]. In a preheated oven, bake at 350
  to 390 degrees F for 40 to 50 minutes.
  
  Let cake cool in pan for 5 to 10 minutes, then carefully invert into a
  grate and let cool all the way. Half a day before serving, cover with

 Categories: Cookies, Vegetables, Kooknet
      Yield: 25 Squares
 
      1    Egg
      4 tb Unsalted (sweet) butter
    1/4 c  Honey
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      1 c  Grated zucchini
      1 c  Whole wheat pastry flour,
           -minus 2 tablespoons
      2 tb Wheat germ
      2 tb Soy flour or flour made from
           -dried garbanzo sprouts*
      1 ts Baking powder
  1 1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ginger
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
    1/2 c  Chopped nuts
 
  ....Sprouting the garbanzo beans causes an explosion of nutrients and
  the development of vitamin B12, which is very rare in vegetables. The
  flour...makes these low-calorie confections in a high-energy food. The
  combination of grains and beans greatly enhances the biological value
  of the protein.
  
  Preheat oven to 350F.
  
  In food processor, blender, or mixing bowl, blend egg, butter, honey,
  and vanilla until smooth and creamy. Add the zucchini and mix to
  combine. In a bowl, combine flour, wheat germ, soy or garbanzo bean
  flour, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg.  Mix to blend
  ingredients. Stir in the nuts.
  
  Spread the batter in a 9-inch-square baking dish, lined with parchment
  paper or greased with a few drops of liquid lecithin and oil.
  
  Bake for 30 minutes.  Cut into 1 1/2-inch squares.
  
  Approximately 65 calories each.
  
  *SPROUTED GARBANZO BEAN FLOUR:  Soak 1/2 cup garbanzo beans in about
  2 cups of water overnight.  Next morning, pour off the water. (Save
  it and use it in soup--it contains valuable vitamins and minerals.)
  Rinse the beans and spread them out in a colander. Dampen a dish
  towel or two layers of paper towels, and place over the beans. Slip
  the whole thing into a plastic bag to retain moisture, but leave it
  open at one end to ensure a source of oxygen.
  
  Remove the covering and rinse the beans several times a day. In two or
  three days, you will have sprouted garbanzos.
  
  To make the flour, spread the sprouted garbanzos out on a baking
  sheet and then dry them in a gas oven by the heat of the pilot light
  or in an electric oven heated to 250F, then turned off. Don't put the
  beans in the oven until you turn it off.  Leave them for about 6
  hours. If they are not thoroughly dried, remove them from the oven
  and raise the temperature again to 250F, turn off the oven, and
  repeat.
  
  When the sprouted beans are thoroughly dried, grind them in a seed
  mill, blender or food processor.

  :          savory
  :          Freshly ground black pepper
  
  A zucchini quiche but the crust is made with a crunchy wild rice; try
  Wehani. It's a satisfying counterpoint to the creamy French custard
  filling.  Allow time to cook and cool the rice. Preheat an oven to
  350F. [PATh 12 Oc 96 Mc-Recipe]
  
  To make the crust, beat the egg, cheese, lemon juice, and melted
  butter together in a howl. Stir in the cooked rice, season to taste
  with salt and pepper, transfer to a 9-inch piepan, and press with
  your fingertips to cover bottom and sides evenly . Bake until set and
  crisp, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool to room
  temperature, about 30 minutes. (Or cover and refrigerate as long as
  overnight; return to room temperature before filling.)
  
  Meanwhile, make the filling. Place the squash in a colander set over
  a bowl or in a sink. Generously sprinkle with salt, mix with your
  fingertips to distribute the salt, and let stand for 30 minutes.
  Gather squash in your hand and gently squeeze to release any
  additional surface moisture. Reserve.
  
  Heat the butter in a saute pan or skillet over medium-high heat, add
  the leek, and saute until soft, about 5 minutes Add the drained
  squash and saute about
        5    minutes longer; reserve.
  
  In a bowl, combine the eggs, cream, mustard, cheese, marjoram, and
  salt and pepper to taste and whisk to blend well. Stir in the leek
  and squash mixture, pour into the rice shell,and bake in the 350F
  oven until filling is set and the top is golden, about 30 to 35
  minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature. Recipe By

  cupcake/muffin tins. Then when the kids wanted a snack, they could
  just take "one" without the worry or mess of slicing from the loaf.

      Title: ZUPPA D'AGLIO - GARLIC SOUP
 Categories: Italian, Soups/stews, Garlic
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3    Heads Garlic, Fresh
    1/4 c  Olive Oil
      1 md Onion, Cut up up
      2    Celery Ribs, Cut Up
      1 c  White Wine, Dry
    1/4 c  All-Purpose Flour
      1 ga Chicken Stock
      1 md Potato, Peeled And Cut Up
      1 c  Whipping Cream
     10    Basil Leaves, Fresh,
           - Chopped
      5    Sprigs Thyme Leaves, Fresh
      2 ts Salt
        ts White Pepper
    1/2 ts Tabasco
      1 ts Extra Virgin Olive Oil
      2    Garlic Cloves, Sliced Very
           - Thin, For Garnish
 
  1.  Cut two of the garlic heads in half across and remove the papery
  outer skin.  Put these cut side down on a very hot surface - a
  griddle or black iron skillet - until they're black. Peel all the
  garlic completely. 2. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan and
  saute the onions, celery, and the garlic until lightly browned at the
  edges. Add the wine and bring to a boil. 3. Sprinkle in the flour and
  stir the pot thoroughly, but don't let it brown.  Add the chicken
  stock, 1/2 gallon water, and the potato. Whisk about the pot well and
  bring to a boil. Reduce to a rapid simmer and cook for about an hour
  and 15 minutes. 4. Strain out the solids from the soup, and puree
  them in a blender or food processor, along with enough broth to ease
  things along. Return the puree to the soup and restore the boil. Add
  the whipping cream, basil, thyme, salt, pepper and Tabasco. 5. Heat
  the extra virgin olive oil in a skillet very hot. In it toast the
  slivers of garlic until brown around the outside. 6 Ladle the soup
  into bowls and garnish with roasted garlic slivers. Float a toasted,
  garlic-buttered slice of French bread on top. Serves eight to twelve.
  Suggested wine: Marinasco Chef Andrea Apuzzo writes of this recipe in
  his book "La Cucina di Andrea's", "Garlic wears many hats. Most
  people think of it in its aggressive, green, aromatic, sharp form.
  But when garlic is cooked slowly for a long time, it takes on a sweet
  nuttiness that is every bit as interesting as its more raw flavors.
  The sweet side of garlic is exemplified by this soup." Andrea's

      Title: ZUPPA DI ASPARAGI (CALABRIAN ASPARAGUS SOUP)
 Categories: Soups, Vegetarian, Italian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    Garlic clove; minced
      2 tb Olive oil; extra-virgin
      2 lb Asparagus; trimmed & cut
           -into 1" pieces
      2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper, black
      4 c  Vegetable broth; OR
      4 c  Low-sodium chicken broth
      4    Eggs
    1/2 c  Parmesan; grated, plus extra
           -for serving
      6 sl Italian bread; toasted
 
  In a large saucepan, cook the garlic in the olive oil over moderate
  heat, stirring constantly, until golden, about 3 minutes. Add the
  asparagus and cook until bright green, about 5 minutes. Add the salt,
  pepper and Vegetable Broth and bring to a boil.  Reduce the heat to
  moderately low and simmer until the asparagus are tender, about 15
  minutes.
  
  In a small bowl, beat the eggs with 1/2 cup of the cheese. Reduce the
  heat to low so that the soup is no longer simmering, and very slowly
  ladle about 2 cups of the hot soup into the beaten eggs, whisking
  constantly. Once incorporated, gradually stir the egg mixture into
  the soup in the saucepan. Increase the heat to moderately low and
  cook the soup, whisking constantly, until it just thickens, about 8
  minutes. Do not allow the soup to boil or the eggs will curdle.
  Remove from the heat.
  
  Place one slide of toasted bread into each soup bowl. Ladle the hot
  soup on top and serve with additional grated cheese.
  
  Note:  Thickening soup with bread is typical of rustic Italian
  cooking, in which nothing goes to waste.  The toasts may be made from
  day-old or slightly stale bread. Serve with a Sauvignon Blanc.

MMMMM-----------------OPTIONAL STREUSEL TOPPING----------------------
      6 tb Butter
    3/4 c  Flour
    1/3 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
 
  In a large bowl, cream the butter, add the sugar (and vanilla), add
  the egg, (salt,) lemon peel and sour cream. Mix the flour and baking
  powder and add that.
  
  Pit the plums, splitting them into halves or thirds. Grease the pan
  and spread the dough.  Liberally spread plums over the dough, meat
  side up. If the plums are sour (as opposed to just tart), sprinkle
  them lightly with sugar.
  
  To make the optional Streusel topping, cream the butter, add flour,
  sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle over the plums. Bake for 30-45 minutes
  in the middle rack at 375 degrees F. Be careful not to let the bottom
  burn!
  
  Serve liberally topped with freshly-made whipping cream.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A Bavarian plum delicacy for dessert -- My mother and grandmother
  make this Bavarian specialty without a recipe; this recipe is from my
  mother, after I pressed her to write it down so I could make my own.
  It also includes variations from a few other folks that you might
  like to try. Roughly translated from Bavarian to German, this is
  Pflaumenkuchen, which, roughly translated from German to to English
  is Plum cake. However, Zwetschgen aren't ordinary plums, a Datschi
  isn't really a Kuchen, and a Kuchen is most definitely NOT a cake!
  
  This dessert is made of the slightly tart Italian plums, which are
  unfortunately only available at certain times of the year. Don't try
  to make it with ordinary plums; they're too sweet and too juicy.
  Yield: Fills one round cake pan.
  
  *  A Datschi may actually be made with any fruit; I happen to love it
  with Zwetschgen the best.
  
  *  I don't know this with Streusel on top, and never prepare it that
  way, but several of my acquaintances swear by it. Made with other
  fruit, I would be more likely to accept the Streusel.
  
  *  If you like, you may sprinkle rum or cinnamon over the fruit before
  baking. Also, you might try substituting rum for the sour cream in the
  dough, or just adding both.
  
  *  If you want to make a cookie-sheet-sized Datschi, simply double the
  recipe.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 20 minutes baking.

      Title: ZWIEBACK
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 50 Servings
 
      1 pk (2-1/4 teaspoons) active
           Dry yeast
    1/4 c  Plus 1/2 teaspoon sugar
    1/4 c  Warm water
      1 c  Plus 2 Tablespoons milk
      4 tb (1/2 stick) butter or
           Margarine
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
    1/8 ts Ground mace
    1/8 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/8 ts Ground nutmeg
      1    Egg, lightly beaten
  3 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
      2 tb Butter, melted, for glazing
 
  "Once you have tried homemade Zwieback, you will never again think of
  it as only a "baby cracker." The seductive aroma from baking this
  fragrant cracker will envelop your kitchen. The final result is a
  complexity of flavor that is nothing less than spectacular. Zwieback
  takes a lot of effort to make -- but it's worth every minute.
  
  The method for making Zwieback is quite different from that for most
  other crackers. "Zwieback" means "twice baked." First you bake a
  yeast bread, aromatically flavored with nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla,
  and mace. Then you slice it and slowly dry the slices in a slow oven.
  For convenience, make the bread over a two-day period. Bake the bread
  the first day and dry it the second. If stored in an airtight
  container, Zwieback will keep almost indefinitely. In a small bowl,
  combine the yeast with 1/2 teaspoon of the sugar and the warm water.
  Set aside in a warm place until the mixture starts to foam, about 5
  to 10 minutes.
  
  In a small saucepan, mix the milk and the remaining 1/4 cup of the
  sugar. Add the 4 Tablespoons butter and heat until the butter has
  completely melted. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and allow to cool
  to lukewarm.
  
  In a large bowl or in the food processor, combine the cooled milk
  mixture with the yeast mixture. Stir in the vanilla. Add the mace,
  cinnamon, and nutmeg and mix well. Beat in the egg.
  
  Slowly add the flour, adding just enough to make a smooth dough that
  is not sticky. If mixing by hand, the dough will become too stiff to
  stir, and you should knead in the last of the flour with your
  fingers. Then knead well for at least 5 minutes, forming the dough
  into a ball. If using a food processor, pulse until the dough comes
  together in a ball.
  
  Place the dough in a large, lightly oiled bowl and turn it over to
  coat all sides. Cover with a damp towel and set the dough in a warm
  place until it has doubled in bulk, about 1-1/2 to 2 hours.
  
  Punch the dough down and knead a few strokes. Cover and allow the
  dough to double in size again, 30 to 45 minutes.
  
  Punch the dough down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface or
  pastry cloth. Knead about 30 seconds to remove the air. Divide the
  dough into 3 equal portions. With your hands, roll each into a smooth
  cylinder or loaf about 2 inches thick and 9 inches long.
  
  Place the loaves crosswise on a lightly greased or parchment-lined
  baking sheet, leaving at least 3 inches between the loaves. Brush all
  exposed surfaces of each loaf with the melted butter. Set the baking
  sheet in a warm place and let the loaves rise until doubled in bulk,
  about 30 minutes.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375~F.
  
  Bake the risen loaves for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the bottoms are
  reddish brown and make a hollow sound when thumped. Allow the loaves
  to cool thoroughly on racks.
  
  Preheat the oven to 200~F.
  
  Cut the cooled loaves into 1/2-inch slices. Place the slices flat on
  the baking sheet and allow them to dry out in the oven for 45 to 60
  minutes, or until thoroughly dry. Check occasionally and turn the
  slices over as they dry on one side. When dry, raise the oven
  temperature to 300~F. for 10 to 20 minutes to brown the Zwieback
  slightly.
  
  Cool on a rack. Yield: 40-50.

  cinnamon, nutmeg and milk mixture and process.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, beat 4 egg whites until stiff but not dry.
  Fold the cheese mixture into the egg whites with a spatula. Pour into
  the prepared pan.
  
  Sprinkle with the reserved crumbs and bake for 1 hour, or until well
  puffed. (There will be a few cracks.) Turn off the oven and leave the
  torte in the oven for 1 hour with the door closed, to cool gradually.
  Remove from oven; transfer to a rack to cool completely. (The cake
  may be stored, covered, for up to 3 days in the refrigerator.) Serve

  Zydeco Green Beans is actually a redundancy.  The exuberant music of
  Louisiana's black French-speaking Creoles is called zydeco, an
  idiomatic phonetic version of les haricots, French for snap beans.
  Serve these green beans as a relish, or as "stirrers" for Bloody
  Marys. ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- In a large saucepan, stir together the water,
  vinegar, sugar, mustard seeds, garlic, bay leaves, salt and Tabasco
  sauce. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 5
  minutes.  Add the beans. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes, until
  tender-crisp. Arrange the beans in a shallow dish and cover them
  completely with the vinegar mixture.  Cover and refrigerate
