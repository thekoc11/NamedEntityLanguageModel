      Title: MUCH TOO RICH CHOCOLATE SORBET
 Categories: Desserts, Chocolate
      Yield: 3 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Sugar
  1 1/4 c  Droste cocoa
    1/3 c  Sherry (add more sugar if
           -you only
           Have dry sherry in the house
           :-), but it is best to use a
           Cream sherry)
      2 c  Water
 
  Mix sugar and cocoa together in bowl.  Add water and whisk until
  smooth. Add sherry and then taste to check if sweetness is to your
  liking. Chill mixture a bit and then put in ice cream maker and
  follow the directions that came with the device.  This concoction
  will take longer than usual to freeze (perhaps as much 2 hours or

  NOTES:
  
  *  Delicious and nourishing bars for hiking or home are ideal to use
  as trail bars, being both filling and full of energy, but are also
  perfect as snacks at home or work.
  
  *  The bars are best kept in the refrigerator, although it's by no
  means essential.  They soften in the heat but don't disintegrate.
  
  *  Any other cereal crumbs can be combined with cornflakes to make up
  the 3 cups.  It's a good way to use up those otherwise annoying
  scraps. If too much powdery stuff goes in, the bars can be somewhat
  dense. Using Rice Bubbles (Rice Krispies) gives a lighter texture.
  
  *  Desiccated coconut is best, as shredded coconut is too course.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  30 minutes.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: MUFFIES: THEY'RE THE TOPS
 Categories: Muffins, Breakfast
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea Muffie tip and hints
 
  Who eats muffin bottoms? Just about everyone prefers the tops. Which
  is why I invented "muffies". They're baked on a baking sheet instead
  of a muffin tin and have no bottom. The muffie has a lot going for
  it: Two cups of muffin batter, which customarily makes 4-6 muffins,
  is enough for 16 muffins. And they take much less time to bake,
  usually less than 10 minutes. I prefer them just lightly browned so
  they stay a little moist and soft inside. Almost any thick muffin
  batter will work, but space the muffies at least two inches part
  because they spread a good deal, especially if the batter is not
  chilled. They way to get a puffier muffie is to refrigerate the batt
  until it is very chilled. Bake the batter right after it is mixed and
  all you'll get is a flat, soft cookie. Muffies should be enjoyed
  warm, right from the oven. To reheat, wrap them in foil and warm
  gently in a conventional oven. To store, arrange in a single layer on
  a baking sheet and freeze them. Once frozen, place them in an airtight
  plastic bag, then in another airtight plastic bag to stave off freezer
  odor. Defrost as needed. The following muffies will get you started.
  The first two are deliberately low in cholesterol. The
  Blueberry-Apple Muffie is not low, but not excessive, either.

 Categories: Breads, Mrs. beeton
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
      1 qt Water
      2 oz Yeast
    1/2 lb Potatoes
    1/2 oz Salt
 
  Makes 24 Muffins or Crumpets
  
  flour
  
  MUFFINS: Wash, peel and boil the potatoes, rub through a colander,
  add the water (just warm enough to bear the hand in it without
  discomfort); then dissolve the yeast and salt in it, and stir in
  sufficient flour to make a moist paste. Beat it well in a deep bowl
  and then clear off the paste from the hands; cover over with a clean
  cloth and leave it to rise in a warm place. When it has well risen,
  and is light and spongy, turn it out on the table, dredge over with
  flour, and then divide it off into pieces about 3 oz in weight, roll
  them up into round shapes, and set them on a wooden tray, well dusted
  with flour to prove. When light enough, see that the hot plate is
  hot, and then carefully transfer the muffins from the tray, one at a
  time, using a thin tin slice for the purpose, taking particular care
  not to knock out the proof or the muffins will be spoilt. When they
  have been properly cooked on one side, turn over with the slice and
  cook the other side. When the muffins are done, brush off the flour,
  and lay them on a clean cloth or sieve to cool.
  
  To toast them, divide the edge of the muffin all round by pulling it
  open to the depth of about 1 inch with the fingers. Put it on a
  toasting fork and hold it before a clear fire till one side is nicely
  browned, but not burnt; turn, and toast it on the other. Do not toast
  them too quickly, otherwise the middle of the muffin will not be
  warmed through. When done, divide them by pulling them open; butter
  them slighlty on both sides, put them together again, and cut them
  into halves. Pile on a hot dish and send quickly to table.
  
  Time: 25 to 30 minutes to bake. Sufficient for about 2 dozen muffins.
  
  CRUMPETS: Proceed exactly the same as directed for Muffins (above),
  but stir in only half the quantity of flour used for them, so that
  the mixture is more of a batter than a sponge. Cover over, and leave
  for 1/2 an hour. At the end of that time take a large wooden spoon
  and well beat up the batter, leave in the spoon, cover over, and
  leave for another 1/2 an hour. Then give the batter another good beat
  up. This process must be repeated 3 times with the intervals. When
  completed, see that the hot plate is quite hot, lay out some crumpet
  rings rubbed over inside with a little clean lard on a baking tin,
  and pour in sufficient of the batter to make the crumpets. When
  cooked on one side, turn over with a palette-knife, and when done
  take off on to a clean cloth to cool. Muffins and crumpets should
  always be served on separate dishes, and both toasted and served as
  quickly as possible.
  
  Time: about 20 minutes to cook. Sufficient for about 2 dozen.

MMMMM-----------------WALDINE VAN GEFFEN VGHC42A----------------------
 
  Central Grocery's muffuletta (pronounced letta, not lotta) is the same
  sandwich that has been served at the Decatur Street, New Orleans stor
  for 9 decades. It's made of imported cheeses and meats and topped
  with an olive salad that contains more than 40 spices and other
  ingredients. The muffuletta-style bread was known earlie in Sicilyl
  and immigrants brought the idea of baking the round loaves of Italian
  bread to New Orleans where more than 1 baker served it as a sandwich
  around the turn of the century. Putting the bread together with the
  cold cuts, thus making the sandwich, is thought to be an American
  version. The local family that has carried the tradition through to
  modern fame is the Tusa familk, descendants of Salvatore Lupo, the
  founder of Central Grocery. The sandwich ingredients are imported but
  not all from Italy. Central Grocery's muffuletta contains Emmentaler
  cheese from Switzerland, provolone cheese from Italy, Genoa salami,
  Holland ham and mortadella sausage from Canada. The olive salad is a
  family recipe. The sandwich is NOT served hot.

 Categories: Breads, Ethnic
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Warm water (110F)
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Active dry yeast
      3 c  Bread flour
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Vegetable shortening
      1 ea Sesame seeds
 
  In a 2-cup measuring cup, combine water and sugar. Stir in yeast. Let
  stand until foamy, 5 to 10 minutes. In a food processor fitted with
  the steel blade, combine 3 cups flour, salt and shortening.  Add
  yeast mixture. Process until dough forms a ball, about 5 seconds.
  Stop machine; check consistency of dough. It should be smooth and
  satiny. If dough is too dry, add more warm water, 1 tablespoon at a
  time, processing just until blended. If dough is too sticky, add more
  flour, 1 or 2 tablespoons at a time, processing just until blended.
  Process 20 seconds to knead. Lightly oil a large bowl, swirling to
  coat bottom and sides. Place dough in oiled bowl; turn to coat all
  sides. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm, draft-free
  place until doubled in bulk, about 1-1/2 hours. Lightly grease a
  baking sheet. When dough has doubled in bulk, punch down dough; turn
  out onto a lightly floured surface.  Form dough into a round loaf
  about 10 inches in diameter; place on greased baking sheet. Sprinkle
  top of loaf with sesame seeds; press seeds gently into surface of
  loaf. Cover very loosely with plastic wrap; let rise until almost
  doubled in bulk, 1 hour. Place rack in centre of oven. Preheat oven
  to 425F. Remove plastic wrap. Bake loaf in centre of preheated oven
  10 minutes. Reduce heat to 375F; bake 25 minutes.  The loaf is done
  when it sounds hollow when tapped on bottom. Cool completely on a
  rack before slicing. makes 1 loaf.

      Title: MUFFULETTA FROM NEW ORLEANS
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Loaf Italian Bread, round
           Ham
           Salami
           Provolone Cheese
           Mozzarella Cheese
           Olive Salad
 
  Slice the loaf of Italian bread in two and warm in an oven until
  toasty. Place the cheeses on one half and the meats on the other.
  Thickness and quantity of cheese and meat can vary with each
  individual, but one layer of each ingredient is standard.  Cover the
  half that has the meat on it with olive salad.  Put the two halves
  together and cut in quarters.
  
  There are three crucial elements to making a good muffaletta:
  
  1.  Fresh, quality ingredients 2. Good olive salad. The Central
  Grocery in New Orleans, which probably makes the definitive New
  Orleans Muffaletta, now sells their olive salad by the jar. It's
  available in groceries across New Orleans, but I don't know if it is
  distributed past here. 3. Warming the bread *before* making the
  sandwich. Many people put everything together on the bread and shove
  the whole thing in the oven. This is wrong. When you remove the
  sandwich, the cheese and the olive salad are way too hot. If you heat
  the bread before making the sandwich, the cheese will melt on the
  warm bread, the meat will warm up, and the olive salad will stay
  around room temperature.
  
  Enjoy!

      1    Stalk celery, coarsely
           -chopped
      1    Lemon sliced
    1/4 ts Whole peppercorns
           Salt
           White pepper
      1 c  Home made mayonnaise made
           -with olive oil
 
  Fish must be absolutely fresh. Clean the fish well making sure the
  gills are removed from the head. Separate the head from the body and
  remove all bones from fish. Save head and bones. Place onion, carrot,
  celery, one slice lemon and the peppercorns into a fish poacher. Add
  the fish filets, the head and the bones. Add cold water to cover and
  1/2 tsp salt. Simmer, covered, for 10 - 20 minutes or until done. The
  fish is done when the eye pops out a little and the meat flakes.
  Remove from heat. Carefully pick out any pieces of meat avoiding
  bones and vegetables and arrange inside a fish mold or on an oval
  serving plate. Lightly season with salt, white pepper and lemon
  juice. Strain the broth and return to the stove. Let it boil
  uncovered until the liquid is reduced to about a cup, then pour it
  over the fish and refrigerate until the gelatin is firm. To serve,
  unmold and cut in half lengthwise with a sharp knife. Then cut each
  half into four or five pieces diagonally forming a fishbone pattern.
  Mask the cuts under a swirl of mayonnaise so the effect looks like a
  whole fish. Cut the lemon slices and arrange around the fish to look
  like fins.

      2    Onion
      3 c  Water
      2 ts Mom's Allspice

  Quarter and slice onions, and fry in oil until dark brown. Meanwhile,
  combine lentils, spices, water, and bring to a boil. Add onions and
  rice, and cook until rice is tender.
  
  A variation on this is to substitute egg noodles for the rice, and
  toss in some frozen chopped spinach. This makes for more of a "soup",
  while the other is meant as a side dish.

      2    Onions, chopped
      1    Dried red pepper -or-
    1/2 ts Cayenne
           -salt & pepper to taste
      1    Red bell pepper, julienned

      2 c  Chicken broth
      2 ts Turmeric
    1/2 ts Coriander
      1    Lemon
      1    Ear fresh corn
 
  Cut chicken in 6 to 8 pieces, wash and pat dry with paper towels.
  Brown chicken in oil until golden on all sides. Remove chicken from
  pan and reserve. Brown chopped onions lightly in the same oil. Return
  chicken to the pan with stock and seasonings. Grate lemon rind and
  reserve. Squeeze lemon and add juice to the stock. Bring stock to a
  simmer and add the bell pepper strips.  Cut kernals from the ear of
  corn and puree in a blender, add to the stock, cover pan, and simmer
  for 8 minutes. Turn the chicken breasts and simmer until tender
  (about 5 minutes). Remove cooked breasts to a serving platter and
  keep warm while the other pieces finish cooking 15 to 20 minutes.
  [COOKS NOTE: Use your judgement here. I find it is usually the backs
  that I remove first, not the breasts] Transfer remaining chicken to
  the serving platter and reduce stock rapidly over high heat. Pour
  sauce over chicken and sprinkle with the reserved lemon rind. I serve
  over a bed of rice so we don't waste any of the sauce

      Title: MULLED PORT WINE JELLY
 Categories: Canning, Condiments, Jam/jelly, Mc
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
        1    Unblemished medium size --
  :          eating orange
        8    Whole cloves
        1    Approx  2 1/2" cinnamon --
  :          stick; broken
        6    Whole allspice -- - slightly
  :          bruised
    1 1/2 c  -- Boiling water
    1 3/4 oz Box powdered regular
  :          pectin*
    2 1/2 c  Good-quality red port**
    4 1/2 c  Sugar
  
  *Do not use the kind intended for low-sugar preserving.
  
  **Or substitute Madeira, Marsala or a full-flavored red table wine.
  (I used port.) This is a two-stage recipe. One day (or at least
  several hours) before you'll make the jelly, rinse the orange and
  stick the cloves into it. Wrap the orange loosely in aluminum foil
  and bake it, set directly on the shelf, in a 350 F. oven for 1 hour.
  Open the wrapping and check the orange; if it is very soft and the
  juices have begun to caramelize inside the foil wrapping, it is
  ready; otherwise continue to bake it until it is soft and the juices
  in the wrapping are turning a rich brown.
  
  Unwrap the orange and drop it into a deep bowl.  Add the cinnamon and
  allspice and mash everything together. Pour in the boiling water,
  cover the bowl and let it stand overnight.
  
  Pour the mixture into a sieve set over a bowl and press the solids to
  strain off as much liquid as possible. Discard pulp and strain the
  liquid again, this time lining the sieve with cheesecloth. Measure
  the liquid; if you don't have 1 1/2 cups, add water.
  
  Pour the liquid into a preserving pan.  Add pectin and stir to
  eliminate lumps.  Set the pan over medium-high heat and bring the
  mixture to a boil, stirring constantly. Boil it hard (at a boil that
  can't be stirred down) for exactly 1 minute.  At once add the wine
  and sugar. Lower the heat and stir the mixture until the sugar has
  dissolved, 2 or 3 minutes; it should not simmer, much less boil.
  Remove from heat.
  
  Skim off any foam and ladle the jelly into hot, sterilized jelly
  glasses or straight-sided half-pint canning jars, leaving 1/2" of
  headspace in the glasses or 1/8" in the jars. Seal the jelly in
  glasses with melted paraffin; seal canning jars with sterilized
  canning lids according to manufacturer's
  
  directions.  Cool, label and store the jars.
  
  If the jelly will be used within a few months, it may be refrigerated
  unsealed but covered.  Keeps, sealed, for a year in a cool pantry.
  
  Yield: About 6 cups.
  
  Witty writes: "Flavored with an orange that has been stuck with
  cloves and roasted, plus a touch of whole cinnamon and allspice, this
  is a rich, deep, dark-flavored wine jelly, superb as a relish with
  venison, other game, poultry, or cold meat.
  
  "For making this, a premium-quality California red port is fine; you
  do not need to invest in an imported bottle. Mulled wine jelly is
  also very good when made with a full-bodied red wine - Rhone,
  Burgundy, Zinfandel, whatever you like the most." From _Fancy Pantry_

 Categories: Beverages, Seasonings
      Yield: 2 Quarts
 
      1    Bottle claret; OR...
           - other full-bodied red wine
      1 qt Black tea
           -- pref. Assam or Darjeeling
    1/4 c  Mild honey
    1/3 c  Sugar; or to taste
      2    Oranges
           -- sliced thin and seeded
      2    Cinnamon sticks (3-inch)
      6    Whole cloves
      3    Rosemary sprigs
 
  The aroma of this beverage is inviting and the punch can be kept warm
  over very low heat for a few hours, which makes the house smell
  wonderful. If you have leftovers, remove the oranges and rosemary,
  let the punch cool to room temperature, then refrigerate. Reheated
  gently with fresh oranges and rosemary, the punch will be a bit
  stronger, but still quite enjoyable.
  
  DIRECTIONS: =========== Pour the wine and tea into a noncorrodible
  saucepan.  Add the honey, sugar, oranges, spices, and rosemary. Heat
  over low heat until barely steaming. Stir until the honey is
  dissolved.
  
  Remove the pan from the heat, cover, and let stand for at least 30
  minutes. When ready to serve, reheat until just steaming and serve
  hot.

      Title: MULLIGAN'S BOXTY PANCAKES
 Categories: Pancakes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      6    Pontiac potatoes
      2    Onions
      2    Eggs
           Self-raising flour
           Salt and pepper
 
  Peel the potatoes and onions and process together to a coarse puree.
  Do not overprocess - the texture should be a bit rough. Add 2 eggs,
  beaten, and salt and pepper to taste. Add enough self-raising flour
  to make a batter with a thick pouring Heat a hotplate or large frying
  pan, add a little oil and pour in a large ladleful of batter on one
  side of the pan and another on the other (there probably won't be
  room for more than two pancakes at a time).
  
  Cook on medium heat until the pancakes are golden brown underneath,
  then turn and cook the other side. Serve with apple sauce (made by
  stewing sliced granny smith apples with a little water, sugar and
  lemon juice and stirring from time to time until a soft puree).

    1/4 c  Sunflower seeds

      1 tb Poppy seeds
    1/4 c  Carrots;grated(optional)
 
  Add everything (except the seeds and nuts) to breadbaker in the order
  appropriate for your machine. I have Panasonic and use VARIETY Cycle
  which allows me to take the dough out, work with it, then put it
  back(minus the blade-VERY IMPORTANT) to continue to bake. If you
  don't have this feature, you can just set it to a dough cycle and
  finish baking manually. The important thing with this bread is that
  you have to add the seeds and nuts separately because of the large
  qty, otherwise they will fly around the machine and make a mess.
  **For the Panasonic, on the Variety Cycle, it will beep after about 2
  hrs. and 20 min. (and will indicate 1:55 on machine). When it beeps,
  take dough out and put on a floured surface. Also TAKE DOUGH BLADE
  OUT OF BUCKET. Add the seeds & nuts, carrots too if desired. (Raisins
  can also be added as well). Work it into the dough, so it is spread
  fairly evenly. Put back in bucket, and press START. *** You can also
  roll out dough, place ingredients on top and then roll up the dough,
  tucking under the ends.

      Title: MURGH MUSALLAM (CHICKEN CURRY)
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1    Chicken
      1    Ginger piece, fresh
           -(about 3/4 inch of
           -a ginger root)
     14    Garlic cloves
           -(or less)
      1 lg Onion
      1    Cinnamon stick
      2    Brown cardamom pods,
           -whole
      4    Green cardamom pods,
           -whole
      1    Star anise, whole
           -(use all 8 arms and
           -the seeds inside them)
     14    Black peppercorns
           -(or less)
      8    Cloves (or less)
      1 ts Turmeric
      1 ts Red chili powder
           -(or substitute fresh
           -red chilies, diced)
      2    Green chilies
    1/2 c  Yogurt
    1/4 c  Oil (preferably ghee,
           -if available)
           Salt to taste
           Coriander leaves,
           -fresh (optional)
 
  Clean and joint chicken.  If you don't like the skin, remove it.
  
  Mash the ginger into a paste (or chop finely) and mince the garlic.
  
  Heat oil in a large frying pan.  Use "medium-high heat".
  
  Break apart the star anise to release the seeds inside the arms. To
  the frypan, add onions, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, star aniseed,
  peppercorns, cloves, garlic and ginger. Be careful not to burn the
  garlic. Saute until the onions are cooked but not browned.
  
  Add the chicken, turmeric and chili powder and cook on a medium heat,
  stirring often.
  
  When the oil starts to separate (the gravy will have oil floating on
  its surface), add the yogurt and cook till the chicken is done and
  the gravy is thick. Finally, add the fresh coriander leaves.
  
  This is the basic recipe.  Try  varying the whole spice combinations
  until you find a favorite. The recipe doubles well.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken curry -- This recipe is the real thing. Throw out your
  curry powder:  you'll never use it again once you've tried this
  recipe. Chicken curry using the real spices cannot be beat!! Yield:
  serves 2-3.
  
  *  A cardamom pod is not the same thing as a cardamom seed. Make sure
  you get the pods. A pod is about the size of a pea and contains seeds
  inside it. Don't substitute the ground version of any of the whole
  spices, the effect will not be the same. And don't use white cardamom
  pods.
  
  *  You may want to remove the smaller whole spices prior to adding the
  yogurt so that unwitting guests don't eat them. Try the recommended
  quantity of garlic. The flavour is surprisingly subtle. More yogurt
  makes more gravy. Also a longer cooking time. Vary the amount of
  chilies to suit your taste. This recipe is medium-hot. I hope this
  satisfies your mouth-hunger.  The spice quantities may be varied to
  suit your preferences.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy, though timing matters when cooking the onions.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1 1/2 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  measure the oil.

      Title: MURKHA DAL
 Categories: Indian
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
 
      1/4 c  Butter
        2 ts Black Mustard Seeds
        1    Onion -- Finely Chopped
        2    Cloves Garlic -- Finely
  :          Chopped
        1 TB Ginger Root -- Grated
        1 ts Turmeric
        2    Green Chiles -- Finely
  :          Chopped
        1 c  Red Lentils
        4 c  Water
    1 1/4 c  Coconut Milk
        1 ts Salt
  
  Melt the butter in a large saucepan over a moderate heat. Add the
  mustard seeds and cover the pan. When you can hear the seeds popping,
  add the onion, garlic, and ginger root. Cook, uncovered, until they
  are soft and the garlic is brown, about 7 - 8 minutes.
  
  Stir in the turmeric and green chilies and cook for 1 ~ 2 minutes
  until the chilies soften a little.
  
  Add the lentils and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently, until the
  lentils begin to turn translucent.
  
  Add the water, coconut milk, and salt. Stir well. Bring to a boil,
  then reduce the heat, and simmer for 40 minutes, or until the desired
  consistency is reached. You may like it more liquid than I do, in
  which case 40 minutes will be about right, but cook it longer if you
  prefer a thicker consistency. (However, if you intend to reheat the
  dal later rather then eat it straightaway, cook for only 30 minutes
  to allow for reheating time.)
  
  Serve immediately while piping hot.

  1 1/2 c  Dried chick peas; (garbanzos
           ;or drained canned chick pea
           ;thoroughly drained & rinsed
           ;under cold water
           Olive oil
      2 md Eggplants; (about 1 lb. ea.)
           ;washed but not peeled and
           ;cut into 2 inch cubes
      3 md Onion; peeled and cut into
           ;1/4 inch thick slices
      3 ts Salt
           Black pepper; freshly ground
     12 md Tomato; fresh, ripe, peeled,
           ;seeded & finely chopped or
           ;4 cups chopped, drained
           ;canned tomatoes
  1 1/2 c  Water
 
  NOTE:  Starting a day ahead, wash the dried chick peas in a sieve
  under cold running water, then place them in a large bowl or pan and
  add enough cold water to cover them by 2 inches. Soak at room
  temperature for at least 12 hours.  Drain the peas and place them in
  a heavy 2 to 3 quart saucepan.
    Add enough fresh water to the chick peas to cover them completely
  and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer
  partially covered for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours until the peas are
  tender but still intact.  Replenish with more boiling water from time
  to time if necessary. Drain the peas in a sieve or colander. (Canned
  chick peas require no cooking and need only to be drained and rinsed
  thoroughly under cold running water.)
    Preheat the oven to 400 degrees (F).  In a heavy 12 inch skillet,
  heat about 1 inch of oil over high heat almost to the smoking point.
  Drop in the eggplant cubes and, stirring frequently, cook for about 5
  minutes, or until they are lightly browned on all sides. With a
  slotted spoon, transfer them to a 9 by 14 by 2 1/2 inch
  baking/serving dish and spread them out evenly.
    Add the onions to the oil remaining in the skillet and, stirring
  frequently, cook over moderate heat for 8 to 10 minutes, or until
  they are soft and delicately browned. watch carefully for any signs
  of burning and regulate the heat accordingly.
    Spread the onions and all of their cooking oil on top of the
  eggplant and pour over them an additional 1/2 cup of olive oil.
  Sprinkle the onions with 1 teaspoon of the salt and a few grindings
  of pepper. Scatter the chick peas on top, and cover them with the
  tomatoes. Sprinkle with remaining 2 teaspoons of salt and a few
  grindings of pepper and pour in the water.
    Bring the musakka'a to a boil on top of the stove, then bake in the
  lower third of the oven for 40 minutes, or until the vegetables are
  very tender. Cool the musakka'a to room temperature and serve
  directly form the baking dish, accompanied by Arab bread.

      Title: MUSCAT ICE
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Tart green gooseberries
      3    Heads elderflower blossoms*
      6 oz Caster sugar
    225 g  Greek strained yoghurt
 
  *Note: The recipe originally calls for 3 OR 4 heads of elderflower
  blossom. ~
  
  Put the gooseberries into a heavy-based saucepan or casserole. The
  fruit should be still damp from rinsing under the tap but there is no
  point in spending time topping and tailing it as it is going to be
  sieved. Add the florets of elder blossom, stripped from their stalks,
  and bury them among the fruit. Cover tightly and cook in a low oven
  until the fruit is tender and pulpy - I allow 1 hour or so at 275-300
  F (140-150 C) gas mark 1 or 2. Or cook over a very gentle flame if
  preferred.
  
  Add the sugar and stir until it no longer feels gritty. Then rub the
  fruit and every drop of its sugary juices through a sieve to make a
  perfectly smooth seeless puree.  As soon as it is cold, spoon the
  pale aromatic puree into a chilled loaf tin, cover it and freeze.
  
  About an hour later, when the ice is firm around the edges but still
  soft in the centre, beat it or whizz it in a food-processor until
  mushy. Gently fold in the yoghurt, cover and freeze until solid all
  the way through.
  
  Then turn out the ice-cream, beat it again to break up any ice
  crystals and transfer it to 8 petit pots de chocolat. Cover and
  freeze until about 1 hour before serving, when the ice-cream should
  be placed in the fridge to "ripen" it.  Amaretti biscuits go very
  well with this.

      Title: MUSHROOM & CELERIAC SALAD
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    175 g  Button mushrooms
    1/2    Lemon; juiced
    100 g  Celeriac
           Various lettuce leaves
           Watercress, washed
      1    Garlic clove; crushed
      2 tb Thick Greek yogurt
      1 tb Dijon or mild mustard
        tb Finely chopped summer herbs
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  When celeriac is unobtainable, you can use finely sliced celery heart
  for this delicious salad. The mixture is flavoured with garlic, mild
  mustard and summer herbs, and is lovely served with warm granary
  bread.
  
  Slice or quarter the mushrooms and sprinkle lemon juice over them.
  Peel the celeriac and cut into matchstick-sized pieces or shred in the
  food-processor. Drop immediately into water to which you have added a
  squeeze of lemon or spoonful of vinegar to stop it discolouring while
  you quickly prepare the rest of the salad.
  
  Arrange the salad leaves on two plates. Add the crushed garlic to the
  yogurt. Stir in the mustard, salt and pepper. Drain the celeriac and
  stir into the dressing. Add the mushrooms and the chopped herbs and
  mix well. Pile the mixture on to the salad leaves and serve as soon
  as possible.

 Categories: Vegetables, Sauces, Pies/tarts
      Yield: 4 Main-dish
 
MMMMM------------------------NORMA WRENN-----------------------------
      1 sm Celery root (3/4 lb)
      2 md Leeks
      1 lb White mushrooms
      3 tb Olive oil
      1 lg Onion; finely chopped
      1    Lemon; halved
    1/2 ts Dried tarragon
           Salt/freshly ground pepper
      2 md Garic cloves; minced
    1/4 c  Fresh flat-leaf parsley
           + more for garnish; chopped
           Mushroom Sauce
    1/2 c  Creme fraiche or sour cream
      2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan or
           Asiago cheese
           Yeast Dough or Pie Dough
      1 lg Egg; beaten
 
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Thoroughly scrub the celery root,
  trim off a thin piece from both ends and peel; set aside the
  trimmings. Thinly slice the celery crosswise, then cut into 1/4-inch
  dice. Transfer to a nonreactive bowl and cover with cold water to
  prevent discoloration. Trim the root end and the dark green portion
  of the leeks; set aside. Coarsely chop the remaining white and tender
  green portion of the leek and rinse well but don't dry. Trim off the
  mushroom stems and set aside. Slice the mushroom caps crosswise
  1/2-inch thick. (Use the celery root trimmings, leek trimmings and
  mushroom stems to make the Mushroom Sauce.)
  
  In a large nonreactive skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil oer low
  heat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the diced celey root to the
  skillet. Add the chopped leeks and onion. Squeeze half a lemon over
  the vegetables, add the tarragon and cook until the liquid is
  evaporated and the vegetables are tender and just beginning to brown,
  about 12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.  Transfer the mixture
  to a nonreactive bowl.
  
  In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil over high
  heat until it starts to shimmer.  Stir inthe mushrooms until coated
  with oil, then squeeze the remaining lemon half over them. Cook until
  the mushrooms begin to color, about 2 minutes.  Season with the
  parsley and salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and stir in the
  celery root mixture. Fold in 1/2 cup of the Mushroom Sauce, teh creme
  fraiche and the Parmesan.
  
  On a lightly floured baking sheet without sides, roll out the galette
  dough into a 14-inch round. (Alternatively, divide the dough into 4
  even pieces and roll into 8-inch rounds.)  Spread the filling over
  the dough, leaving a 2-inch border.  Fold up and pleat the border of
  the dough. Brush the dough with the beaten egg. Bake the galette
  until golden, about 30 minutes for Yeast Dough and 40 minutes for Pie
  Dough.
  
  To serve, pour 1/4 cup of the Mushroom Sauce over the top of the
  Mushroom Sauce over the top of the galette. Garnish with chopped
  parsley. Cut the galette in wedges and spoon some of the sauce over
  each one.

      3 c  Sliced leeks
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
  2 1/2 c  Thinly sliced or small-diced
           Domestic mushrooms
  2 1/4 oz Fresh shiitake mushrooms
      1 ts Balsamic vinegar
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      1 tb Italian parsley or mixed
           Herbs
           Crepe Batter:
    1/2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Whole-wheat pastry flour
    1/3 c  Masa harina (a type of corn
           Flour)
      2 c  Water
           Sauce:
      5 oz Dried shiitake mushrooms
      4 lg Onions, roughly chopped
      4 c  Domestic mushrooms
      6 c  Water
      2 c  Dry red wine
      6 tb Semolina flour
           Freshly chopped parsley or
           Other herb for garnish
 
  For filling, braise leeks in white wine for 20 minutes. Add domestic
  and fresh shiitake mushrooms. Add balsamic vinegar to mushrooms and
  cook until all liquid has been released and is mostly reduced. Add
  salt and pepper to taste before mushrooms have been completely
  cooked. Toss with parsley or mixed herbs. There should be 5 cups
  filling.
  
  For the crepe batter, sift flours and masa harina together. Mix in
  water until batter forms light cream that can coat wooden spoon. If
  batter is lumpy, you can blend it in blender. Make test crepe. Ladle
  about 3 ounces of batter onto nonstick skillet.  Cook until golden on
  both sides. The crepe should be wafer-thin and malleable; if not, add
  more water and mix again.  There should be about 3 cups batter,
  enough for 14 crepes.
  
  For sauce, add shiitake mushrooms, onions, and domestic mushrooms to
  water. Cook for 30-45 minutes, until onions become soft and some of
  liquid is reduced.  Use slotted spoon to remove onions and mushrooms,
  reserving liquid.  There should be about 1 1/2 cups remaining. Add 2
  cups red wine to stock and cook for a few minutes on very high flame
  to reduce alcohol. Gradually whisk semolina flour into simmering hot
  stock until thickened but still pourable.  There should be about 2
  2/3 cups sauce.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 [degrees] F.  For each crepe, fill with 1/3 cup
  filling and top with 1 1/2 tablespoons sauce. Roll and place in
  baking pan. Repeat until all 14 crepes are made. Ladle more sauce
  over crepes in baking dish and bake 10 minutes, or just until hot.
  Use chopped parsley or chopped fresh herbs as garnish.

    1/4 c  Butter
      1 sm Onion, chopped
      1    Clove garlic, minced or

  Mushroom Almond Pate
  
  Spread almonds in a shallow pan and toast in a 350 degree oven for 8
  minutes or until lightly browned
  
  Melt butter in a large frying pan over medium high heat. Add onion,
  garlic, mushrooms, salt, thyme and pepper. Cook, stirring
  occasionally, until onion is soft and most of the pan juices have
  evaporated.
  
  In a food processor or blender, whirl almonds to form a paste, With
  motor tunning, add oil and whirl until creamy.
  
  Add mushroom mixture and whirl until pate is smooth.
  
  Chill until set.
  
  I used walnuts, because I had them on hand, and this turned out fine.
  I served it alongside thinly sliced toasted rounds of italian bread.
  Yum. Next to that, I had a wedge of brie surrounded by bite-sized
  hunks of carrots (cutting veggies to bite size saves the worry some
  people have about others who dip, bite, then stick something bitten
  back into the dip. . .) and a dip I make for veggies that is yummy,
  but not for the faint of heart.
  
  Spicy Yogurt Dip
  
  1 c nonfat yogurt 1 1/2 Tbsp apricot honey (or 1 Tbsp honey plus 1/2
  Tbsp apricot preserves) 1 tsp curry powder 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
  
  Mix all ingredients together and let sit for at least an hour. The
  flavor intensifies, but you may want to add curry and/or cayenne
  later. This tastes sweet, and you don't realize it's hot until it's
  too late.

    1/2    Green pepper, chopped
    1/2    Red pepper, chopped
      1    Carrot, cut into bite-sized

    1/2    Onion, sliced
        x  Chopped mushrooms (use your
           Favorite amount or none at
           All)
      2 lg Cloves garlic, crushed
      1 cn Vegetable stock (I used Hain
           Fat-free veggie broth) Or 2
        c  Stock you've made yourself
        x  Cumin
        x  Tabasco sauce
        x  Black pepper
        x  Tamari
        x  Salt (just a bit)
           Lemon juice
 
  Toss the carrots into a hot wok and cook for a few minutes, add the
  garlic, onions and green peppers, deglazig the pan with water or
  tamari. Add the mushrooms and cook just until the mushrooms start
  giving up their liquid. Add the garbanzo beans, barley, and vegetable
  stock.
  
  Add spices to taste.  The tamari really worked well in this, but I
  only used a tablespoon for the whole recipe. The black pepper and
  tabasco gave it some "kick" and I threw in the cumin because I like
  the flavor. Add these in small amounts if you don't like things
  really hot. I ended up having something that was too hot because I
  accidentally threw in too much tabasco (I used the lemon juice to
  counter it, and it was fine). The salt is optional.  I put in just a
  touch.
  
  You can add more water and/or water/tamari mix if you want to make it
  a little soupier.
  
  Cook it until it's really hot and serve over toasted whole wheat
  bread, like a sloppy joe.  Even though it's been warm during the day
  here in the Northeast, we've still had some cool evenings, so hot
  food has been okay. This is good served with fruit salad or tossed
  salad.

           Coarsely grated Parmesan
           -cheese, for garnish (opt)
 
  For a delicate dinner or lunch pasta, try my mushroom sauce tossed
  with bow-tie or butterfly shapes. Try to use extra-virgin olive oil
  for flavor when cooking this dish, since there are so few
  ingredients. It's not necessary to season the pasta with salt if
  using Parmesan cheese, as it's a bit salty. And if you opt for the
  Parmesan, freshly grated is a must!
  
  1. Trim mushroom stems and wipe caps clean with a paper towel. Slice
  lengthwise.
  
  2. Toss mushrooms, shallots and garlic with oil in a large, heavy
  saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring, for 10 minutes.
  Season with pepper. Toss in 1/3 cup parsley and lemon zest. Cook 1
  minute longer. Reserve, covered, on the stove.
  
  3. Shortly before serving, cook the pasta in boiling, salted water,
  stirring once, 6-8 minutes or until AL DENTE. Drain, reserving 2
  tablespoons of the cooking liquid. Toss pasta with mushrooms and
  reserved liquid; then toss with Parmesan and serve immediately, or
  serve the cheese alongside. Garnish with remaining tablespoon of
  chopped parsley.

  for a further 4-5 minutes. Stir in the soured cream or yogurt and
  heat through gently. Season to taste with salt, pepper and a little
  lemon juice.

      1    Crepe recipe

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Shiitake mushrooms; dried
      2 tb Olive o8il
      1 c  Onion; finely chopped
      3    Garlic cloves
      2    Bay leaves
      4 c  Mushrooms, fresh; finely
           -chopped
      1 ts Tarragon
      2 tb Whole wheat pastry flour
    1/3 c  Dry red wine
      2 tb Tamari, or to taste
           Cayenne to taste

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      1 c  ;water or mild vegetable
           -stock
  1 1/2 tb Arrowroot OR
      2 ts Kudzu powder
      2 tb Dry red wine
      1 tb Tamari, or more to taste
 
   Prepare the crepes.
  
   Filling: Place the shiitake mushrooms in a bowl. Cover them with
  water and let them soak for at least 1 hour.
   Discard the stems and finely chop the mushrooms. Set aside.
  
   Heat the oil in a skillet. Add the onion, garlic and bay leaves.
  Saute over low heat until the onions are translucent. Add the
  shiitake mushrooms, the fresh mushrooms, and the tarragon. Cook until
  the mushrooms are done.
  
   Stir in the flour and mix well. Pour in the wine while continuing to
  stir. Cook until the mixture thickens.
   Add the tamari and cayenne to taste. Set the filling aside while you
  make the sauce.
  
   Sauce: Dissolve the arrowroot or kudzu in the water.
   Add the wine. Cook in small saucepan over high heat, stirring
  constantly, until the sauce thickens. This is not supposed to be very
  thick, so do not overcook it.
   Add the tamari to taste and mix well.
  
   To assemble:  If the filling mixture has cooled down, heat it by
  returning the skillet to the stove and stirring the mixture over
  medium-high heat until it is hot.
  
   Place about 1/4 cup of filling in the center of each crepe and roll
  up the crepes.
  
   Place the crepes on individual serving plates. Pour some of the
  sauce over each crepe and serve.
  
   Note: If you made the crepes earlier and want to heat them up, place
  the unfilled crepes in a cake pan, cover them with aluminum foil, and
  bake them at 350 degrees until heated through.

      Title: MUSHROOM CROUSTADES
 Categories: Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Wholemeal cottage loaf rolls
      1 lb Small cap mushrooms
    1/4 pt Double cream
      3 oz Butter
      1 sm Garlic clove
           Fresh rosemary
 
  Cut the knobs off the rolls and reserve as lids. Scoop out most of the
  crumb from the rolls, taking care not to pierce the crusts. Crush the
  garlic with a pinch of salt, about 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped
  rosemary and a good grinding of black pepper.  Mash these flavourings
  into 2 1/2 oz butter and spread it thickly over the insides of the
  hollowed-out rolls.
  
  Season the cream generously with salt and pepper, add 1/2 teaspoon
  fresh chopped rosemary and leave in a cool place to infuse. Slice the
  mushrooms thickly, and heat the oven to 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6.
  
  Sit the rolls on a baking tray and put the lids beside them. Bake for
  10 minutes until heated through and slightly crisp. Meanwhile heat a
  large frying pan. Add 1/2 oz butter (don't be tempted to use more)
  and, when the foam dies down, saute the mushrooms. Cook them,
  stirring frequently, for 4-5 minutes to reduce them and intensify
  their flavour. Pour on the cream and let it bubble up for a few
  seconds.  Turn and stir the mushrooms for a minute or so until every
  slice is coated with the scant but richly flavoured sauce.
  
  Away from the heat, check and adjust seasoning.  Pile the creamy
  mixture into the freshly baked croustades, top with the lids and
  serve straight away with a large green (or tomato) salad on the side.

      Title: MUSHROOM ESSENCE
 Categories: Condiments, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 oz Boletus mushrooms, dried*
      6 c  Very warm water
      2 md Shallots, peeled & chopped
      6 ea Peppercorns
      1 ea Blade whole mace -=OR=-
      1 pn Ground mace
    1/2 sm Bay leaf
 
  *One oz. = 2/3 cup.  Suggested mushrooms are cepes, porcini,
  Steinpilze or boletes marketed as "Chilean dried mushrooms." Combine
  mushrooms in a bowl with 4 cups very warm water. Push them under the
  surface, weight them with a saucer, and let them soak overnight or
  for at least 6 hours, until they are very soft. Stir them
  occasionally. Lift mushrooms from the liquid with a slotted spoon
  (save the liquid) and chop them fine, saving as much juice as
  possible.  Combine them with the remaining 2 cups water in a
  saucepan, bring them to a simmer, and simmer them, covered, for 20
  minutes. Meanwhile, to clear the soaking liquid of grit, pour it
  carefully into a bowl, leaving behind the sediment - this is certain
  to be sandy. Let the liquid settle again and again pour it off;
  repeat, if necessary, to be sure any grit has been left behind. Pour
  the simmered mushrooms and their liquid into a sieve set over a bowl
  and lined with fine nylon net or two layers of dampened cheesecloth.
  Press hard on the mushrooms to extract all possible liquid; discard
  the debris. Let this second batch of liquid settle, then decant it as
  described for the soaking liquid; repeat if necessary. Combine the
  two batches of liquid with the shallots, peppercorns, mace and bay
  leaf in a saucepan.  Bring the liquid to a boil over medium-high heat
  and simmer it briskly, uncovered, until it has reduced to 2 cups.
  Strain out the solids and let the concentrated liquid settle for one
  last time - we're still on the track of any sand that may remain.
  Decant the cooled essence, then freeze it in an ice-cube tray. Remove
  the cubes from the tray and store them in an airtight freezer
  container. Keeps for up to a year in the freezer. Yield: 16 cubes,
  about 2 tb. each.

           Oil, for frying

MMMMM-----------------------BRAISING SAUCE----------------------------
           Lemon grass, white part
           -- only, minced
      2 tb Shallot, minced
      2 tb Rice wine
      2 tb Fish sauce
      1 ts Sesame oil
      2 tb Broth, chicken
      1 ts Sugar
           Rice, cooked
           Cilantro (garnish)
 
  Preparation: ============
  
     First julienne the mushrooms and vegetables into thin, short
  strips. Set aside.
  
     Cut the salmon steak in half.  Take each half and slice it most of
  the way through horizontally so the two pieces fold back on a hinge
  like a hamburger or hot dog roll.
  
     Prepare a braising glaze by mixing the "sauce" ingredients above
  in a small bowl and stir and set aside.
  
  Assembly: =========
  
     Into each of the two salmon "sandwich" pieces, add a touch of salt
  and pepper to taste and then add portions of Shitake, and Inoki
  mushroom, celery and carrot as filling for the "sandwiches."
  
     Close up the "sandwiches" and set aside.
  
  To Cook: ========
  
     In a small saute pan, heat a bit of peanut oil over high heat
  until it begins to smoke and then put the salmon sandwiches in to
  brown both sides (about 1 minute each side.)
  
     When both sides are browned, add the braising sauce to the salmon.
  Cover and braise over medium heat until the salmon is done ( 2 to 3
  minutes).
  
     Transfer the cooked salmon sandwiches to a serving plate and serve
  with cakes of sticky rice and garnish with julienne fans of Szechuan
  pickle.
  
     Top with drippings from the saute pan, and pieces of Cilantro.

      Title: MUSHROOM KETCHUP
 Categories: Condiments, Sauces, Vegetables, Dips, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Cups
 
  1 1/2 lb Mushrooms, firm & fresh
  1 1/2 tb Pickling salt
      1 oz Dried boletus mushrooms
      3 c  Hot tap water
      2 c  White wine vinegar
      3 lg Shallots, peeled -=OR=-
      1 sm Onion, peeled
      1 ea Garlic clove, peeled
     10 ea Whole allspice -=OR=-
    1/4 ts Ground allspice
      4 ea Whole cloves
      3 lg Mace blades
      2 ea Bay leaves
    1/2 ts Ground ginger
    1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
    1/4 c  Medium or dry sherry
 
  Wipe mushrooms clean with a damp cloth, or brush them clean. Avoid
  washing them if possible; if it is necessary, swish them rapidly
  through a bowl of water and lift and drain them promptly. Trim off
  any discolored stem ends or damaged portions.  Slice the mushrooms
  thin (a food processor fitted with the thin-slicing disc makes short
  work of this task) and mix them thoroughly with the salt in a ceramic
  bowl. Cover mushrooms with a cloth and let them stand 24 hours,
  stirring occasionally. They will become very dark (the finished
  ketchup will be approximately the color of black bean soup). At least
  an hour before the end of the salting period, combine the dried
  boletus mushrooms with the hot tap water; let them stand, covered,
  until completely soft. Lift the soaked mushrooms from their liquid
  with a slotted spoon (this is to eliminate any grit that may be in
  the liquid) and place them in the container of a blender or food
  processor. Let soaking liquid settle for a minute or two, then
  carefully pour it over the mushrooms, stopping before any grit is
  poured out. Puree the soaked mushrooms, then pour the puree into a
  preserving pan. Without rinsing the blender container, puree the
  salted mushrooms; add this puree to that in the pan. Place about 1/2
  cup of the vinegar in the blender and add shallots and garlic;
  process them to a puree. Add this puree to the mixture in the pan,
  together with the rest of the vinegar, the allspice, cloves, mace,
  bay leaves, ginger and pepper. Bring the mixture to boiling over
  medium-high heat, lower heat, and simmer the ketchup, uncovered,
  stirring it often, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until the tiny fragments
  of mushroom are very soft, almost jellylike, and the ketchup is
  thick. To test for correct consistency, pour a spoonful onto a saucer
  and let it stand 10 minutes, with the pot off the heat; if very
  little or no liquid seeps from the solids, the ketchup has thickened
  enough. If it does not pass this test, resume the cooking for as long
  as necessary. Press ketchup through a sieve to remove the bay leaves
  and whole spices, then puree it again, in batches if necessary, in a
  blender or food processor, running the machine until the texture is
  velvety smooth. Return ketchup to the rinsed-out pan and bring it to
  a full boil again over medium-high heat, stirring it constantly. Stir
  in the sherry. Ladle the boiling-hot ketchup into hot, clean
  half-pint or pint canning jars, leaving 1/4" of headspace. Seal jars
  with new two-piece canning lids according to manufacturer's
  directions and process for 15 minutes (for either size jar) in a
  boiling-water bath. Cool, label and store the jars. Let ketchup
  mellow for a few weeks before serving it. Keeps for at least a year
  in a cool pantry.

      Title: MUSHROOM PATE (BARRY)
 Categories: Barry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8 oz Button Mushrooms, trimmed
      4 oz Open Mushrooms, trimmed
      2 tb Olive Oil
      2    Cloves Garlic, Peeled and
           -chopped
    1/2 ts Powdered Bay Leaf
    1/2 ts Paprika
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 oz Butter
      1    Egg
 
  Wash the mushrooms in a colander of 30 seconds to a minute, using
  very hot water, but don't peel them. Cut into half-inch pieces.
  
  Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the mushrooms and garlic and
  fry over a medium heat until the mushrooms give off liquid. Turn up
  the heat to maximum and boil away the liquid until the mushrooms are
  almost dry.
  
  Put them into a food processor or liquidiser if you have one, with the
  powdered bay leaf, paprika and salt. If you don't have a processor,
  put the mushrooms through a mincer.
  
  Add the butter to the frying pan and scramble the egg in it to take
  up all the remaining liquid and bits of mushroom. When the egg has
  set, put it into the food processor with the mushrooms and herbs and
  puree until the mixture is fine-grained.
  
  If you have minced the mushrooms, put them into a bowl and beat the
  scrambled eggs into them very well - you may find a fork best for
  this - until the mushrooms and egg are well blended together.
  
  Pack the mixture into individual ramekins or a single souffle dish if
  you prefer, and chill for at least five hours before using. Serve
  with warm crusty french bread - what else!!
  
  If you wan't to keep the pate for a few days, seal the top with a thin
  layer of melted butter and keep in the fridge covered with foil or
  cling film for up to three days.

           Freshly ground pepper
 
  Soak dried mushrooms in warm water to cover for at least 45 minutes or
  until softened. Remove from liquid carefully and rinse well under cold
  running water to remove any sand clinging.
  
  Chop mushrooms roughly and drain thoroughly. Strain soaking liquid at
  least twice through a sieve lined with cheesecloth and reserve.
  
  Heat a couple of teaspoons of reserved mushroom liquid and diluted
  balsamic vinegar in a heavy skillet and saute onion until translucent
  and tender, 10-15 minutes. Use additional mushroom liquid if onions
  start to stick. Add garlic and all mushrooms, turn heat to low and
  cook, stirring intermittently, for up to 20 minutes, until tender.
  Add tomatoes, parsley, salt and pepper to taste. Continue cooking
  another 5 minutes.
  
  Serve over slices of polenta.
  
  Note: the dried porcini are expensive but integral. They have an
  incredible woodsy flavor and odor.

      8    Green olives
      1 T  Butter
      2 T  Olive oil
      2 T  Onion; finely chopped

     32    Wonton skins
           Parmigiano-Reggiano;
           -grated

MMMMM-----------------------MUSHROOM SAUCE----------------------------
      8    Porcini, dried (cepes)
  3 1/2 c  ;Water, hot
      2 ts Butter
      2 ts Olive oil
      1 c  Onion; diced
      2 pn Oregano, dried
      1 pn Thyme, dried
      1    Bay leaf
      2 T  Parsley; roughly chopped
      4    Mushrooms; roughly
           -chopped
      2    Garlic clove; roughly
           -chopped
           Salt
      2 ts Butter
      1 T  Flour
      1 c  Wine, red, dry
      1 ts Dijon mustard
      1 ts Tomato paste; or sun-dried
           -tomato puree
           Pepper
 
  Chop the mushrooms finely, either by hand or in a food processor, so
  that they end up in coarse fragments rather than fine pieces, 1/8
  inch or so long.  Press down on the olives to break out the pits or,
  if this doesn't seem to work (this is a little harder with green
  olives than with black), slice away the flesh with a paring knife and
  chop them slightly finer than the mushrooms.
  
  Heat the butter and oil in a skillet and add the onion, oregano,
  parsley, and mushrooms. Salt lightly and cook over brisk heat,
  stirring constantly, for five or six minutes.  The mushrooms should
  start to color a little and the onions soften.  Add the garlic during
  the last few minutes of cooking so that it doesn't burn. Season with
  pepper and set aside to cool before filling the ravioli.
  
  Lay out 16 wonton skins.  Heap two to three teaspoons of filling
  neatly into the center of the squares, then paint the edges with
  water and cover securely with the top pieces of dough.  Firmly press
  the sides together, squeeze out any air, and cut with a ravioli
  crimper to secure. Set the ravioli aside on a tray dusted with flour,
  cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.
  
  Make the sauce below.  To cook the ravioli, slip them into gently
  boiling salted water and simmer until the edges of the squares are
  done and they rise to the surface, about three to five minutes. Serve
  in warm pasta plates with the sauce and a grating of
  Parmigiano-Reggiano.
  
  Sauce:  Cover the dried mushrooms with the hot water and set them
  aside to soak while you prepare all the other ingredients. When
  you're ready to use them, run your fingers over the mushrooms to
  loosen any hidden sand, then pour the soaking water through a paper
  towel. Heat the butter and oil in a wide skillet or a saucepan and
  add the onion, dried herbs, parsley, fresh mushrooms and garlic. Cook
  over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, for about five minutes.
  Add salt to taste and continue cooking until the onions begin to
  color a little, another few minutes. Add another two teaspoons of
  butter to the pan.  Stir in the flour, working it into the vegetables
  as well as you can; the whole mass will be quite thick, and the pan
  will become very dry.  Next pour in the red wine, bring it to a boil,
  and let it reduce for a few minutes.  Stir in the mustard and tomato
  paste and pour in the mushrooms and their soaking water. Bring to a
  boil and cover the pan; then lower the heat and simmer slowly for 25
  minutes. Strain and season to taste with salt and pepper.  (This
  sauce would also be good with other pasta or rice.)

  small bowl && set asside.  Reduce heat to medium && steam/saute
  onions && garlic, using teaspoons of the water or stock to keep them
  from sticking, until the onions are soft. Add mushrooms, cover, and

 Categories: Beef, Mushrooms, Sauces
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 ea Lean beef steaks
      1 tb Canola oil
      1 ea Onion (small)
    180 g  Mushrooms, sliced
    1/2 c  Beef stock
      2 tb Worcestershire sauce
      2 tb Chopped parsley
 
  Heat a heavy based pan on high. Brush oil onto both sides of steak.
  
  To seal, cook steak 2-3 minutes each side. Turn when juices appear on
  uncooked side
  
  Note: Steak thickness determines cooking time. As a gudie: Rare remove
  after sealing; reduce heat for medium and cook and extra 2-3 minutes
  each side; Well done, 4-6 minutes each side.
  
  Test steak by pressing with tongs. Rare feels string. Medium has some
  resistance. Well done feels quite firm.
  
  Remove from heat, rest while making sauce. Add onion and mushrooms to
  any pan juices. Cook 1 minute. Add worcestershire sauce and
  stock(*1). Bring to boil, stirring constantly until slightly
  thickened. Add parsley and any juices from rested steak.
  
  Serve with steamed vegetables and mash potatoes.
  
  Recipe from Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation cards.
  
  *1 - I also recommend adding about 2-3 ts of cornflower to the sauce
  to thicken it slightly.

  Soak the dried mushrooms in a quart of hot water for several hours.
  Drain, reserving the liquid.  Wash mushrooms under running water, one
  by one, and trim off the hard stems. Cut in wide strips. Strain the
  liquid through cheesecloth, there should be about 2 cups. Simmer the
  liquid until it is reduced by slightly more than half. Thickly slice
  the fresh mushrooms. Saute the minced onion in butter until they are
  transparent, then add the sliced fresh mushrooms and toss over high
  heat until they have released their excess water and it is starting
  to evaporate. Season with thyme, salt and pepper to taste. Add the
  soaked mushroom strips and reduce the heat to medium-low.  Gradually
  whisk the mushroom liquid into the sour cream, and add this mixture
  to the mushrooms. Simmer gently, stirring often, for 15 to 20 min.

      Title: MUSHROOM STROGNOFF
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Mushrooms
   3/16 ts Salt
   1/16 ts Pepper
    1/3    Onion; in 1/4-in slices
  1 1/3 tb Butter
    2/3 tb Flour
    1/3 c  Vegetable stock
    1/3 ts Dijon mustard
   1/16 c  Sour cream; room temperature
 
  1. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a pan and add the flour. 2. Mix in
  the vegetable stock and heat, stirring all the time until
     thickened. 3. Blend in the mustard and remove from the heat. 4. In
  another pan melt the remaining butter and add the mushrooms
     and onions and saute for 5 minutes until the onions start to
  soften. 5. Add the mushrooms to the sauce, and simmer for 15 minutes.
  Remove
     from the heat and stir in the sour cream. 6. Stir in the onions,
  and serve.
  
  I sometimes add coriander or lemon grass. Lemon grass goes down well,
  and if you add coconut milk/cream instead of the sour cream,lime
  juice and tomato paste you get a nice Thai mushroom dish. Thai dishes
  are often like a soup, so increase the liquid a bit and serve in a
  large bowl with two spoons so you can share it, and a large plate of
  rice.
  
  It's one of my own creations so report back!

      Title: MUSHROOM VARENIKI WITH ROASTED TOMATO & RED
 Categories: Low, Fat
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 md Onion
      6    Cloves garlic
      2 c  Mushrooms (I used a mixture
           Shiitake, dried porcini,
           And
           Button mushrooms)
      2 ts Fresh thyme
      1 md Potato (~ 6 oz)
           For the sauce:
      1 lg Red bell pepper
     10    Roma tomatoes
           ~ 1 C canned tomatoes with
           Juice
           For the dough:
      2 c  Flour (I use a 1:4 mix of ww
           And white)
    1/2 c  NF milk or soy milk
      1    Egg or 1 eggs worth of your
           Substitute of choice
      1 ts Salt
 
  To make the dough: place the ingredients in a food processor. Process
  until it forms a ball.  Knead by hand for ~ 5 min. then wrap it in
  plastic and let the dough rest for 30 min.
  
  To make the sauce: Give the red bell and the fresh toms a quick spray
  with some food release spray (like PAM). place under a broiler and
  cook, turning occasionally until they begin to char (10-15 min).
  Place the veggies alon with the canned toms into your food processor
  or food mill and puree. Force the puree through a sieve to smooth it
  out a bit. Add salt and pepper to taste along with some chili paste.
  Put the sauce in a pan and keep it warm ~ the vareniki will finish
  cooking in it.
  
  To make the filling: Finely chop the garlic and onion ~ begin to
  saute in a little veg stock.  Chop the mushrooms very fine and add to
  the onion mix. Cook this over medium heat until the mushrooms just
  begin to brown. Take off the heat.  While the shrooms are cooking
  peel and slice the potato and zap it in the microwave for a few
  minutes until it's cooked enough to mash. Mash the potato in with the
  mushroom mix. Season to taste. Oh yeah - add the thyme a couple of
  minutes after you add the mushrooms.
  
  To assemble: Divide the dough into thirds.  Roll the dough to ~ 1/8"
  thic and cut into 3 1/2" inch circles. Place ~ 1tsp of the filling in
  the center of each circle. Fold the dough over to form a half-moon
  shape and seal it shut with your fingers. Place them on a lightly
  floured towel while you finish making the others.
  
  To cook: bring a pot of water to a boil.  Add 8 or 9 vareniki to the
  water. Wait for them to float to the top, then wait ~ 1 minute longer
  before removing, place into a bowl to keep warm. Cook the remaining
  vareniki the same way.  When all are done cooking dump them into the
  sauce and cook over low heat for 5-10 minutes.
  
  This will serve 3-4 people depending on what else you have with it.
  
  PS: add 1 sliced onion to the other veg for roasting.

      Title: MUSHROOM-BACON PARTY PATE
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Loaf
 
      2 lb Mushrooms (fresh),
           -chopped very fine
    1/2 lb Bacon (or more,
           -to taste)
    2/3 c  Onion, chopped
           -very fine
    2/3 c  Celery, chopped
           -very fine
      4    Eggs
      8 oz Cream cheese at
           -room temperature
    1/2 c  Parsley, chopped
           -very fine
      2 c  Dry bread crumbs
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Rosemary, dried
      1 ts Oregano, dried
    1/4 ts Black pepper, ground
 
  Fry the bacon and crumble it as fine as possible. Reserve some of the
  grease.
  
  Chop the mushrooms, onion, celery and parsley as fine as possible. A
  food processor works best, but you can do it by hand if need be.
  Saute the onion and celery in the bacon grease until soft, then
  remove from the grease and drain.
  
  Meanwhile, beat the cream cheese slightly, and then beat in the eggs.
  Add all other ingredients to the eggs/cheese mixture. Mix thoroughly.
  
  Grease a large loaf pan or two small, line with foil, and then grease
  the foil.  Pat the mixture into the loaf pan and cover loosely with
  foil. Bake for 1 1/2 hours at 400 degrees F.
  
  Let cool completely before serving.  This pate is actually best when
  refrigerated before serving.  Serve with crackers, or with bread cut
  into shapes with cookie cutters. To make this a more elegant buffet
  dish, garnish the top with a thin layer of aspic.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  This is heavenly stuff for a buffet, and for those people who love
  to munch, but hate liver pate.  We found it in a magazine some years
  ago. The magazine has long since been forgotten, but this I know by
  heart! Yield: 1 large loaf.
  
  *  American bacon is called smoked back bacon in many other places.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy if you have a food processor.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, several hours baking and cooling.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

   4. Mix together the cooked and drained pasta, the sauteed
  vegetables, the tofu mixture, and the peas.
   Place in an oiled baking dish. Top with the bread crumbs and drizzle

 Categories: Mexican, New text im, Too hot tam
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
 
        1 TB olive oil
        1 lb mushrooms -- thickly sliced
        1 ts sea salt -- or to taste
        3    Guajillo chiles

        2    garlic cloves -- peeled
    1 1/2 TB lard or peanut oil
        1 lg sprig epazote cleaned
  
  Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and
  salt. Cover the pan and cook until the mushrooms are just tender,
  about 10 minutes. Drain the mushrooms, reserving the liquid, and set
  both aside. Remove the stems, slit the chiles open, and remove the
  seeds and veins. Cover with hot water and soak for 15 minutes, or
  until soft. Drain. On a hot comal, toast the chiles, making sure they
  do not burn. Crush the clove, peppercorns and cumin seed with a
  mortar and pestle or in a spice or coffee grinder. In a blender,
  place the chiles, crushed spices, and garlic. Blend until smooth,
  adding a little water only if necessary. In a large heavy skillet,
  heat the lard until smoking, then add the chile sauce and fry over a
  fairly high heat. Scraping the bottom of the pan often so it doesnt
  stick, cook until reduced, about 5 minutes. Add sufficient water to
  the reserved liquid from the mushrooms to make 3/4 cup. Add this, the
  epazote, and mushrooms to the chili sauce, and cook over a medium
  heat for about 5 minutes. Serve with rice and warm flour tortillas.

  This is an easy-to-prepare dish for the quicksilver Gemini that
  combines the foods of Mercury (parsley and mushrooms) with a creamy
  coating. Because of their association with death, mushrooms are an
  appropriate food for the god whose duty was to conduct the souls of
  the dead to the under- world. Rich in minerals and vitamins, parsley
  helps relieve nervous conditions (often a Gemini complaint) and
  soothes the stomach. Serve this delicious starter with a very chilled
  white wine and thin slices of whole wheat bread and butter.

 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1    Onion; finely chopped
      1    Garlic clove; crushed
     25 g  Butter
           -OR sunflower margarine
    225 g  Small button mushrooms
           -- finely sliced
      1 ts Moutarde de Meaux (1-2 tsp)
    100 g  Thick set yogurt
           Salt
 
  Based on a classic Stroganoff recipe, this version loses the wine
  (and of course the beef!), and makes a delightful dish with
  mushrooms, garlic, grainy mustard and thick yogurt. Serve it warm, on
  a bed of rice, with a side salad.
  
  Soften the onions and garlic in the butter or sunflower margarine
  until translucent - about 10 minutes. Add the mushrooms and stir
  until they are beginning to cook through but are not too soft. Strain
  off most of the juices, reserving 2 tbs. Stir in the mustard and salt
  to taste and mix thoroughly. Mix the reserved cooking juices into the
  yogurt, and stir into the mushrooms. Heat through and serve warm.

      Title: MUSHROOMS WITH EGGS
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    150 g  Mushrooms
      1 tb Tarragon vinegar
      2    Eggs
           Salt and pepper
 
  Mushrooms taste deliciously fresh cooked in this way - steamed in a
  pan with a little tarragon vinegar, refreshingly sharp. The blandness
  of the egg is a perfect match for them. This simple supper dish is
  very quick and easy, yet distinctly different.
  
  Trim the mushrooms, removing the ends of the stalks. Wash them and
  pat dry. Cut each mushroom into fine slices and put them into a
  well-greased frying-pan. Sprinkle with the vinegar and season with
  salt and pepper. Cover, and cook over a gentle heat for about 10
  minutes, shaking the pan from time to time.
  
  Drop two eggs into the pan before all the water produced by the
  mushrooms has evaporated. Leave to cook, uncovered, for a further 3-5
  minutes, depending on individual taste.

      1/4 c  Minced Fresh Mint
  :          Salt And Pepper -- To Taste
  
  *NOTE: Original recipe used 3 T olive oil...I didn't want all that
  fat but did want some of the taste so I changed it. **NOTE: Original
  recipe used 1/4 C stock...you might need to add more if you use less
  olive oil. ***NOTE: We used Portobello, crimini, shiitake, oyster and
  chanterelle. They were truely wonderful!!
  
  This Middle Eastern dish produces quite a bit of liquid that you drain
  before serving; save these juices to make a flavorful soup stock.
  
  Heat oil and stokc in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms
  and garlic; cover and simmer until soft and brown, 8 - 9 minutes. Add
  tomato; cook 1 min more. Stir in lemon juice, mint, salt and pepper;
  remove from heat.  Drain and serve at room temp.
  
  Serves 6 (Recipe states it will serve 4 but it serves at least 6
  using the mushrooms that we used.)

      Title: MUSHROOM~ BECHAMEL~ & CHEESE PIZZETTE
 Categories: Pizza, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Recipe pizza dough
      1 lb Mushrooms
      2 tb Unsalted butter
           Salt & pepper to taste
      1 c  Bechamel sauce
    1/2 lb Gruyere cheese;freshly grate
      2 tb Parmesan cheese; fresh grate
      2 tb Unsalted butter
 
  "The cuisine of Piedmont in Italy has a decidedly French undertone.
  Where else would you eat pizza with Bechamel Sauce? If you think this
  combination is a bit rich, Waverly Root, in "The Food of Italy,"
  describes a similar pizzette to which freshly grated white truffle
  was added. Extravagant, yes, but absolutely scrumptious. Dried
  porcini or fresh golden oak mushrooms would also make an excellent
  and less expensive variation."
  
  Preheat the oven to 500 degrees for at least 30 minutes. Lightly coat
  a baking sheet with vegetable oil.
  
  Clean mushrooms and slice thin, then saute them in 2 tablespoons of
  butter until all their excess liquid has evaporated.
  
  Divide 1 recipe pizza dough into 6 or 10 or 12 equal pieces and roll
  or press out each ball to the desired size. Arrange the pizzettes on
  one or more prepared baking sheets. Spread each pizzette with some
  Bechamel Sauce. Distribute the mushrooms over the sauce and top with
  the cheeses. Dot each pizzette with butter and bake for 10 to 15
  minutes, or until golden.
  
  Yield: 6 6-inch appetizers size OR 10 to 12 4-inch party size
  pizzette.
  
  NOTE: Slomon suggests these crusts: Basic Pizza, Sicilian-style,
  Semolina, Pepper-Lard, Sausage, Prosciutto, Herb, or Onion dough.
  
  VARIATIONS
  
  Soak 2 ounces of porcini in boiling water to cover for 10 minutes.
  Rinse them well to rid them of their sand. Chop them roughly and
  saute them in 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter for 3 minutes. Add the
  mushrooms to the Bechamel and proceed with the recipe.
  
  Fresh golden oak (also known as shiitake mushrooms) or other wild
  mushrooms can be substituted for cultivate mushrooms. Halve the
  amount indicated in the recipe and prepare them in the same manner as
  regular mushrooms.

      Title: MUSHU PORK
 Categories: Meats, Oriental
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
      1 tb Chinese rice wine
           -or dry sherry
      1 tb Light soy sauce
      1 ts Cornstarch
    1/2 lb Boneless pork butt
           -or shoulder, shredded
    1/2 c  Shredded lily stems
    1/4 c  Tree ears; soaked,
           - squeezed dry and shredded
      4    Scallions; shredded
    1/4 c  Shredded bamboo shoots
      5 tb Peanut oil
      4    Eggs; lightly beaten
      3 tb Chicken broth
    1/2 ts Sugar
      1 tb Chinese rice wine
           -or dry sherry
      1 ts Light soy sauce
      2 ts Sesame oil
           Salt to taste
 
  MARINATE THE SHREDDED PORK for 20 to 30 minutes. Prepare all the other
  shredded ingredients--tree ears, lily stems, scallions and bamboo
  shoots. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a wok over a moderate flame
  and pour in the beaten eggs. As soon as the egg begins to cling to
  the wok, scoop it and fold it over to scramble it. Work fast because
  the egg solidifies quickly and it can overcook. As soon as it
  solidifies, remove it from the wok and set it aside. Stir-fry the
  pork over high heat in 1 tablespoon of the oil for 30 seconds, or
  until it no longer looks raw. Remove it from the wok and set it
  aside. In the remaining 2 tablespoons of the oil, stir-fry the
  vegetables, more to combine them and heat them through than to cook
  them. Add the pork and mix it well with the seasonings. Finally, add
  the eggs, breaking them up to form bite-size lumps. Combine the
  ingredients well. Serve alone or with a platter of heated pancakes
  and a small bowl of hoisin sauce. Serves 2 to 4 as a main course.

  Bring the milk to a boil.  Stirring constantly, add the Musmehl
  flour. Keep at a low boil for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring constantly.
  When ready to serve, with a spoon carefully pour the melted butter

      Title: MUSTARD
 Categories: Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           No Ingredients
 
  White or yellow, brown and black seeds come from the mustard plant,
  according to the species. Most commonly found is the creamy yellow
  type which is the least pungent. The brown type (or Indian mustard)
  is stronger in flavor, while the black mustard seed is the most
  powerful of all. The creamy yellow seeds are more widely available,
  but look for the black and brown types in Asian and Oriental food
  shops and delicatessens.
  
  Whole mustard seeds have a pleasant nutty bite to them and can be
  used to add piquancy to salad dressing and hot sauces. They are
  especially good when served with fish, chicken and pork and are also
  delicious added to cole slaw, creamy potato salad, pickles and
  chutneys. Use mustard seeds (especially the two hotter varieties)
  with discretion to begin with, increasing the amount as you become
  more familiar with the flavors.
  
  It is the yellow seed which, when processed with black seeds, wheat
  flour and turmeric, forms the basis of English mustard. Dry mustard
  can be used as it is in cooking, or it may be mixed to a paste with a
  little cord or warm water. (For a nice, rich mixture, why not try
  mixing it with a little cream or milk?) Once mixed it should be left
  at least 10 minutes to allow time for the flavors to develop. It is
  only when the powder is mixed with a liquid that the essential oils
  are released, giving mustard its pungency and sensation of heat.
  Remember that made mustard loses its pungency after a few hours. Jars
  of prepared mustard, once opened, need using within a few weeks as
  the flavor and color will deteriorate.
  
  The variety of ready-prepared mustards come in a bewildering number of
  mouthwatering flavors, according to the manufacturer. These can be
  made from milled mustard flour, or from coarsely crushed seed (the
  proportions of which vary tremendously, depending on the type). Some
  are mixed with vinegar, others with grape juice or wine (and
  sometimes beer), and often contain various spices, herbs and
  seasonings, such as honey and horseradish. German mustard, which is
  mild and sweet-flavored, is a mixture of brown and white mustard
  flour moistened with vinegar and flavored with various spices. The
  mild-flavored American mustard (popular with children) generally uses
  only yellow mustard seeds with the addition of sugar, vinegar and
  salt. Dijon-style mustard, nade from milled, husked black seeds, is
  flavored with wine and spices. The pungent and spicy grainy types of
  mustard are a mixture of whole, crushed black and yellow seeds with
  additional flavorings added for individuality.
  
  Mustards of all types can be used to great effect, not only as a
  condiment, but also as a culinary ingredient. They add bite and
  piquancy to all types of savory dishes from scrambled eggs, sauces
  and dressings to deviled mixtures, barbecued food, soups, casseroles,
  pastry, scones and cheesy biscuits.

      Title: MUSTARD GREENS
 Categories: Vegetables, Southern
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Mustard greens
    1/2 lb Bacon
      1    Yellow onion
    1/2 ts Pepper
      2 tb Vinegar
 
  Wash the greens carefully about 5 times (like spinach, they can hide
  an incredible amount of grit) by soaking, then swishing in the water,
  then shaking out above the water and checking for dirt in the water.
  Repeat until there has been no grit twice. Now, a hand-sized clump at
  a time, slice into thin strips (about 1/2 inches wide is fine).
  
  Cook the bacon in a deep dish to render the fat. Remove the bacon and
  saute the onion slices until they are just beginning to turn brown.
  Add the sliced greens and stir over medium heat until they wilt, then
  add the reserved bacon and cover the dish. When cooked, add pepper
  and vinegar, then serve.
  
  How long you allow mustard greens to cook is a matter of taste.
  Traditionally, they are cooked to death (in excess of an hour). I
  prefer them cooked for about 10-15 minutes after wilting. It is not
  usually necessary to add water, but do not allow them to dry out.
  There should be some "pot liquor" in the bottom when you're done,
  which people normally fight over.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Cooked mustard greens with bacon and onion -- Lucky you! Down home
  mustard greens!
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: MUSTARD SAUCE #6
 Categories: Other sauce
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Dry mustard
    1/8 ts Salt
      1    Egg
      2 tb Sugar
    1/4 c  Cider vinegar
    1/2 c  Mayonnaise
 
  I too like Mustard Sauce, and have enjoyed making it for many years.
  Recently, I came upon this recipe in the Pillsbury Spring Celebrations
  classics 27, 1983. It's great with won tons, and on sandwiches. In
  small saucepan, combine dry mustard, sugar, salt, vinegar and egg.
  Cook over low heat 2 to 3 minutes until thickened, stirring
  constantly. Chill 10 to 15 minutes; stir in mayonnaise.
    Refrigerate leftovers 3/4 cup. This recipe has more flavor than the
  others. If you use any recipes that taste bland, including restaurant
  offerings, I usually touch them up with a slight amount of sugar and
  salt. Dry Mustard, which I purchase by the pound, vinegar and water
  has very little flavor. Hope this helps. Merry Christmas and May God

 Categories: Sauces, Fish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Champagne or white wine
      2    Anchovy fillets

  The tang of Dijon mustard and the smoothness of whipping cream
  combine with the light flavor of champagne or white wine to make this
  a wonderful, easy sauce for fish.
  
  COMBINE THE BROTH, anchovies, shallots and mustard in a small
  saucepan over medium heat on the stove. Bring to a boil and cook
  until liquid reduces by about 1/3 and begins to thicken. Add the
  cream and continue to cook until the mixture becomes saucelike and is
  thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and
  whisk in the butter. Serve immediately or keep warm in a water bath.

      1 c  Whole wheat flour
      1 tb Whole mustard seeds
    3/4 c  Toasted wheat germ
    1/2 ts Salt
      4 tb (1/2 stick) butter or
           Margarine, softened
    1/2 c  Water
 
  "This curious combination creates flavorful crackers with a unique
  texture. As the basis of a light meal, they go well with cream cheese
  and smoked fish. 350~F. 10 to 15 minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F.
  
  In the food processor or in a large bowl, combine the flour, mustard
  seeds, wheat germ, and salt. Cut in the butter until the mixture
  resembles coarse meal. Mix in enough of the water to form a dough
  that will hold together in a cohesive ball.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for rolling. On a floured
  surface or pastry cloth, roll out into a rectangle 1/16 inch thick.
  With a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares or desired shapes.
  Transfer them to an ungreased baking sheet. Prick each square 2 or 3
  times, with the tines of a fork.
  
  Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown around the edges.
  Cool on a rack. Yield: 55-65.

      Title: MUSTARD~ GERMAN-STYLE
 Categories: Other sauce, German
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Yellow mustard seed
      2 tb Black or brown mustard
           Seed, heaping
    1/4 c  Dry mustard
    1/2 c  Water
  1 1/2 c  Cider vinegar
      1    Small onion chopped
      2 tb Firmly packed brown sugar
      1 ts Salt
      2    Cl garlic
           Minced or pressed
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ground allspice
    1/4 ts Dried tarragon leaves
    1/8 ts Turmeric
 
  In a small bowl, combine mustard seed and dry mustard. In a 1- to
  2-quart non-aluminim pan, combine remaining ingredients. Simmer
  uncovered, on medium heat until reduced by half, 10-15 minutes. Pour
  the mixture into the mustard mixture.  Let mixture soak at room
  temperature 24 to 48 hours, adding additional vinegar if neccesary in
  order to maintain enough liquid to cover seeds.
  
  Process the seeds and mixture in a blender or food processor until
  pureed to the texture you like --this can take at least 3 or 4
  minutes. Some prefer whole seeds remaining, others a smooth paste.
  The mixture will thicken considerably upon standing.  If it gets too
  thick after a few days,stir in additional vinegar.
  
  Scrape mustard into clean, dry jars; cover tightly and age at least 3
  days

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Loaves
 
      6 c  Bread Flour
      1 c  Oat Bran
    1/3 c  Teff; uncooked seenote
      2    Packages Active Dry Yeast
           -2pkg = 4 1/2 ts measurement
      2 ts Salt
  1 3/4 c  Water
    1/2 c  Honey; or Brown Sugar
    1/3 c  Butter; melted
      2 lg Egg; beaten slightly

MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
      1 tb Water; mix with egg
      1    Egg White
      2 tb Oat Bran for top.....
 
  Seenote: Teff; grain uncooked In a large bowl, stir together water and
  Brown Sugar or Honey. Sprinkle with Yeast and stir until it has
  dissolved. Stir in Oat Bran and Teff seed. Let the mixture stand for
  15 minutes to let the Oat Bran absorb liquid. Do all in a KitchenAid
  mixer if available. Add oil and eggs.Mix very well. Stir in Salt.
   One cup at a time, mix in flour until the dough becomes too
  difficult to stir. Turn out on to a "well floured" work surface and
  knead until smooth and elastic, adding flour only as necessary to
  keep from sticking, about 8 minutes. It takes 4 or 5 minutes on the
  KitchenAid. This recipe usually takes 6 full cups of flour.
   This is the place where I freeze 1/2 of this bread....To Freeze:
  place the 1/2 recipe of this dough into an oiled labeled gallon
  plastic freezer bag. Squeeze all of the air out of the bag and seal
  tightly. Freeze at once. To use; defrost several hours until dough
  rises to double its frozen bulk, then proceed...
   For the half recipe of dough that you are going to proceed with,
  continue.
   Place the dough in a large well oiled bowl. I spray the used
  KitchenAid Bowl with non-stick  and throw the dough back in, spray
  the top of the dough as well. Cover with plastic wrap, or a moist
  towel. Let the dough rise in a warm draft free place.
   Check the rise at 45 minutes, the "perfect place" rises this bread
  in 45 minutes.
   Punch dough down. If you are doing this entire recipe, divide the
  dough in half. Shape each half into a loaf. This also makes a nice
  round loaf with a crunchy crust.....
   Pan Loaf making: beginning at one narrow end, tightly roll up the
  dough to form a loaf. Pinch seam edge into dough to seal. Lightly oil
  a loaf pan.
   Meanwhile, place oven rack in the lower third of the oven; preheat
  to 375 degrees F. Place each loaf in a prepared 8 1/2" X 4 1/2" X 2
  1/2" loaf pan, seam side down. Cover, let it rise in a warm place
  free from drafts, until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes . Check the
  rise at 35 minutes, the "perfect place" rises this bread in the pan,
  in 35 minutes.
   This is the place where I make decorative slits into the top of the
  loaf.
   In a small bowl, whisk egg white with one tb of water. Brush a
  little of the egg white mixture over the top of the loaf and sprinkle
  with 2 tb Oat Bran, or sesame seeds just before placing in the oven.
   Bake for 35 minutes on a baking stone or 40 minutes in the bread pan.
   To make the crust even crustier, spray the top of the loaf with
  water, and liberally spray the inside of the over at 5 minute
  intervals and/or place a water filled pie pan in the oven on a lower
  rack than the bread. (boiling water added to the pie pan just before
  baking makes sure you have steam....) Makes one or two loaves, each
  about 18 1/2 inch slices.

      Title: MY BABA'S PYROHY (PEROGIES)
 Categories: Side dish, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Dozen or s
 
  1 1/2 c  Water
      3 tb Cooking oil
      1 ea Egg
  4 1/2 c  Flour
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
      1 ea Medium onion, chopped
    1/4 c  Butter
      3 c  Potatoes, mashed
      1 c  Cheddar Cheese (old), grated
      8 c  Water, boiling
 
  Dough:
  
  Combine water, egg, oil and blend well.  Add flour and 1 tsp of the
  salt. Knead until smooth and soft (8 minutes approx). Put dough into
  a lightly oiled bowl, cover and rest for 20 minutes.
  
  Potato Filling:
  
  Combine (slightly cooled) mashed potatoes and grated cheddar in a
  bowl. Saute onions in butter and add to mashed potatoes. Add in the
  remaining salt (1/2 tsp) and pepper to taste.
  
  Take small pieces of the dough and roll it out until it is very thin
  (1/8" or so).  Take a coffee mug (or round container of your choice)
  and cut our a circular shape.
  
  Into the middle of the circle, drop 1/2 to 1 tsp of the potato
  mixture . Fold the circle in half and seal edges by pinching them
  together. This should leave you with a half moon shape.
  
  When you have completed sealing the pyrohy, it should be laid between
  two clean towels (this prevents it from drying out). Once you have
  made all of the pyrohy possible (when either your dough or potato
  runs out), set a pot of water to boil.
  
  In batches of 6-8 (depending upon how much your pot can hold), cook
  the pyrohy until they are floating. Remove from water, place in a
  casserole dish and melt some butter or margerine on the batch of
  pyrohy to keep them separated nicely.  Continue this until they are
  complete.
  
  Now they're ready to eat.  Also at this time you can freeze them in
  batches (I find that batches of a dozen work well). I love pyrohy
  with sour cream, chives or fried onions and little pieces of bacon
  (shkvarky--optional).
  
  The next day, you may find that frying the pyrohy give you an even
  more pleasant taste!

      Title: MY BEEF BARBECUE
 Categories: Beef
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
      4 lb Beef stew meat -- small
           Cubes
     30 oz Tomatoes -- chopped
      2    Onions -- chopped
      1 qt Water
    1/2 ts Chili powder
      1 ts Salt -- to taste
      1 ts Black pepper -- fresh
           Ground
      1 c  Catsup
    1/2 c  Cider vinegar
    1/3 c  Worcestershire sauce
      4    Garlic cloves -- minced
    1/8 ts Hot pepper sauce
 
  * DO NOT attempt this recipe in a crockpot, since no evaporation takes
  place there.
  
  Combine all ingredients in a VERY large heavy pot. Simmer uncovered
  over low heat until beef falls to shreds, stirring occasionally. This
  will take 5 to 6 hours; watch carefully the last hour to make sure
  that it is not sticking. Mixture should be very thick. The mixture
  fills a large pot before cooking but becomes a small amount by the
  time it is cooked.
  
  While cooking I sometimes add chopped green peppers, celery, bay
  leaf, or carrots.
  
  Serve on hamburger buns with mustard.

  Sift the flour with the salt and salt.   Beat eggs well, add water.
  Add flour gradually to eggs, stirring constantly, until batter is
  smooth and thin. Heat a small frying pan, Teflon makes life easy, and
  smear with a very thin coat of butter. When pan is hot, put in about
  1/4 cup batter, tilt pan until it covers. Cook until it begins to
  blister and is shiny. Turn out on table cloth. I always use one, but
  I guess you can use paper towels. Continue until all the batter is
  used. Should make 10 or 12 circles.
  
  Mix the filling ingredients well. Now it's time to 'build your
  blintzas' as my daughter used to say. Put some filling off center on
  each circle. Fold the bottom up and the top down. Tuck in sides, or
  fold in, before you put the op down. Confused? Just try it, it's easy.
  
  At this point you can store them  in  the fridge, or freeze them. They
  freeze well. To finish, just fry them in a small amount of butter,
  until browned
  
  Great, served with sour cream. They are a bit complicated, but not
  really difficult. and they freeze so well. Use well seasoned pams, 6".

      Title: MY FATHER'S OYSTER STEW
 Categories: Stews, Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 pt Oysters
    1/2 c  Oyster liquor
      1 qt Milk
      1 pt Half & half
      1 c  Cream
      2 tb Butter
           Salt; to taste
           Pepper; to taste
 
  Heat milk, half and half, and cream to the boiling point but do not
  boil. At the same general time, but obviously later because the
  volume of liquid is smaller, heat the oyster liquor in a separate
  pan. When the milk is hot, throw the butter in to melt. Add some salt
  and lots of pepper (I like to use a coarse grind pepper). When the
  liquor is hot, add the oysters. Continue to heat the liquor plus
  oysters until the oysters just begin to curl at the edges, maybe two
  minutes. Then dump the oysters and liquor into the milk.  "Correct
  the seasonings" and serve it forth.
  
  My wife likes to add paprika to hers at the table. I like oyster
  crackers with mine, and in general like the little commercial ones
  rather than the more elegant and expensive ones. You can fiddle with
  this recipe all you want - more milk and less cream, or vice versa;
  more pepper and salt (I like lots of both); fewer oysters - it really
  comes down to your taste.

      Title: MY FAVORITE 2 WAYS TO FIX POTATOES
 Categories: Digest, July
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           None
 
  1) Slice them up, put on a cookie sheet, and bake at 450. After about
  15 minutes, flip them over, sprinkle on desired seasonings (I like
  dill and oregano) and continue to bake. Keep flipping as desired (I
  flip often because they stick).  When they're brown, you've got
  delicious, hot potato chips. I even eat these for dinner sometimes
  when I'm lazy. Also, they puff up really neat.
  
  2) Wash and cube 2 or 3 potatoes (for 1 person, with leftovers). Heat
  potatoes in a skillet with some water. After about five to ten
  minutes, add more water (enough to let it steam for a while) and
  frozen peas (I add up to half a package, because I really like them),
  cover and let steam for 5 to 10 minutes. Add curry powder or garam
  masala, mix, and continue cooking until potatoes are soft enough.
  Add more water (or even better, broth) if need be.  I grind some
  pepper in, too.
  
  This is really good wrapped in a flour tortilla the next day, with or
  without a little rice and/or black beans.

      1    Salmon
      1    Walleye pike

           Fish bones and skin
           -----fish balls-----
      2 lg Onions; coarsely ground
      1 ts Sugar; (optional)
      1 ts White pepper
           Salt; to taste
    1/4 c  Matzo meal; approximately
      4    Whites
      2    Yolks
    1/2 c  Extremely cold water; * see
 
  Recipe by: maury@turing.eecs.uic.edu (Maurine Neiberg) NOTES:
  
  Have the fish market fillet them and give you the bones and skin for
  broth. At this time of year the fish market will probably grind the
  fish for you too, which is an enormous time saver.
  
  Fish fillets ground through a meat grinder. Sometimes the fish market
  will do this for you.  Food processors do not work well for this. The
  texture is wrong, too mushy.)
  
  * put in freezer, but make sure there's no ice in it.
  
  Broth: Put above ingredients in the largest pot you own and cover it
  with water.  Bring to a boil and simmer for 2-3 hours. This should
  make a fairly rich stock.
  
  In a wooden bowl, using a round bladed chopper chop ground fish and
  ground onions.  Use a turning motion, working as much air in a
  possible. (This is where the visual aids come in handy.) Chop for
  about 10 minutes. Add matzo meal and spices and keep chopping using
  the same motions (about 5 more minutes).  Beat egg whites until
  frothy (not stiff) and pour over the fish mixture.  Beat egg yolks
  well, add the very cold water and pour over fish mixture.  DO NOT
  MIX.  Chop the mixture, adding more air, until eggs are well worked
  in.
  
  Strain fish broth and bring back to a gentle simmer. Make balls of
  the fish mixture (handle as little as possible) and drop gentley in
  broth. Peel and slice carrots into 1/4 inch rounds and add to broth.
  Partially cover and simmer for about 2 hours.  Turn the balls
  occasionally if there are too many for them to turn on their own.
  
  When cooked, remove fish balls and place in a single layer in storage
  containers.  Remove carrot slices from broth and put one carrot on
  each fish ball. Refrigerate.
  
  Bring fish broth to a boil and boil lightly for about 3 hours, or
  until reduced to 1/3 - 1/2 of its original volume. Pour reduces broth
  over fish balls and refrigerate until cold and broth has jelled.
  Serve cold with horse raddish.
  
  Serves about 20 people with leftovers.

  2. Put the flour, brown sugar and cinnamon in a large bowl and mix
  with an electric mixer on low speed for 15 seconds. Add the butter
  and mix till the butter pieces are the size of peas. You will still
  see loose flour. Mix in the egg.  The mixture will still look dry.
  Rub any lumps out of the baking soda and gently mix the baking soda
  into the sour cream. Stir the sour cream mixture and the milk into
  the batter.  Stir just until the batter is evenly moistened.  Stir in
  the chocolate chips. The batter will be thick.
  
  3.  Spread the batter in the prepared baking pan. Bake about 40
  minutes. To test for doneness, gently press your fingers on the top
  of the cake. The middle should feel slightly soft and the edges firm.
  A toothpick in the center should have a few crumbs clinging to it.
  Cool on a wire baking rack, the center of the cake will sink slightly.
  
  Notes:  My metal cake pan is the size specified, like a small lasagna
  pan. The cake took 47 minutes to bake.
  
  The 2 Tb. milk is optional, I find the cake is better with it.
  
  This cake is good dusted with powdered sugar and is also good served
  with vanilla ice cream.

  Recipe by: The County Fair Cookbook - ISBN 0-7868-6014-6 1. In a large
  bowl, beat eggs until light. Stir in milk and sugar. 2. In another
  large bowl, sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and nutmeg
  together. Stir half of the flour into the egg mixture. Add the butter
  and lemon juice and mix until combined. Stir in the remaining flour
  mixture to make the dough. Cover and chill about 90 mins. 4. On a
  floured work surface, roll out the dough about 1/2 inch thick. Cut
  with a doughnut cutter or cookie cutter into 3-inch rounds; cut out
  the centers and either fry them for doughnut holes or roll again to
  get a larger yield. 5. In a deep heavy skillet, heat 3 inches of
  shortening to 365 F on a deep-frying thermometer. Fry 3 or 4
  doughnuts at a time, turning with tongs, 2 to 3 mins or until golden
  brown. Drain on paper towels. Replace the shortening as needed. Dust
  with sugar, if desired. Note from Barbara says these are delicious
  dipped in fresh maple syrup.

 Categories: Entrees, Chinese, Cathe
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Lettuce head
      4 c  Corn oil
    1/3 c  Walnut pieces
      1 oz Bean thread noodles
      1 tb Garlic, minced
     12 oz Pork, ground
      2    Green onions
      1 cn Smoked clams
      1 cn Water chestnuts (small)
      1 c  Lettuce, coarsely chopped
      1 tb Soy sauce
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
      2 tb Oyster sauce
      1 ts Sherry
    1/4 ts Sugar
      1 ts Sesame oil
      2 ts Cornstarch, mixed with
      1 tb Water
 
  Cut green onions into pea-sized pieces.  Drain and chop coarsely the
  smoked clams and water chestnuts. Detach lettuce leaves from core,
  wash and dry them gently. Arrange lettuce leaves around the edge of a
  large platter.
  
  Heat oil in wok until it is about to smoke.  Tear bean thread noodles
  apart and cut with scissors into small portions. Carefully put a
  portion of the noodles into the hot oil. (They will expand
  dramatically!) As soon as they expand, turn them over and cook the
  other side briefly. Drain them and remove to a bowl lined with
  several layers of paper towels. Cook the remaining noodles in the
  same way. Drain them very well with paper towels and then crunch them
  and put them into the center of the serving platter, surrounded by
  the lettuce leaves.
  
  Put the walnuts into a strainer and immerse them into the hot oil.
  They will brown very quickly.  Be careful they do not burn. Remove
  them to a paper towel, drain well and chop into coarse pieces.
  
  Remove all but 2 T of oil from the wok.  Saute the minced garlic and
  chopped green onions until lightly browned. Add the ground pork and
  saute until it loses its pink color and starts to brown. Use a large
  spoon to remove as much grease as possible from the pork mixture.
  
  Add the chopped smoked clams, chopped water chestnuts and chopped
  lettuce to the pork mixture.  Mix well.
  
  Combine the soy sauce, cayenne, oyster sauce, sherry, sugar and
  sesame oil; stir into the cooking mixture and cook for two minutes,
  stirring constantly.  Remix the cornstarch and water and add to the
  middle of the wok.  Stir constantly, blending other ingredients into
  cornstarch mixture and simmer three more minutes.
  
  Pour the cooked dish on top of the bean thread needles on the serving
  platter.  Sprinkle the walnut pieces on top and serve at once. To eat:
  Place a lettuce leaf on your plate. Put a spoonful of the pork
  mixture and noodles in the middle of the leaf.  Fold the leaf up and
  eat the package like a bared.  Serves 12 as part of a family style
  Chinese dinner, 4 as a main dish.

           - (Thai or purple basil)
      2    Red Serrano chili peppers
           -seeded & very finely minced
      4    Garlic cloves; minced
  1 1/2 lg Boned chicken breast halves

      8 oz Small, cooked shelled shrimp
      2    Eggs; lightly beaten
      2 c  Fresh bean sprouts

    1/4 c  Roasted, unsalted peanuts
           - coarsely ground
           Cherry tomatoes; halved
           Lime wedges
           Mint sprigs
           -OR- sliced green onions
 
  Combine the vinegar, water, fish sauce, tomato paste, sugar, and dried
  shrimp in a small bowl; mix until well blended and reserve. In a
  large pot, soak the noodles in enough water to cover. In a small
  skillet or pot, heat vegetable oil 3/4 to 1 inch deep to 350 degrees,
  or until a dried rice noodle puffs instantly when dropped into the
  oil. Deep-fry the basil leaves a few at a time, turning them once or
  twice until they are crisp, or 40 seconds to a minute; drain on paper
  toweling.
  
  Bring the noodles to a boil and cook them 2 minutes, or until they are
  almost tender.  Drain and rinse them well, then spread them on paper
  toweling to dry slightly. Head a wok or large skillet and add about 2
  1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil.  Fry the Serrano peppers about 30
  seconds, then add the garlic and stir-fry until it is soft. Add the
  chicken or pork and stir-fry until the chicken is almost opaque
  throughout or the pork is browned.  Stir in the shrimp and the sauce
  and mix completely. Make a well in the center of the mixture and pour
  in the eggs. When they are almost set, scramble them evenly.  Add
  half the noodles, throughly incorporating them into the mixture; stir
  in the remaining noodles and half the bean sprouts.  Cook just until
  the bean sprouts are nearly wilted.
  
  Heap the meat and noodles onto a platter.  Cover one half of them with
  ground peanuts and the other half with uncooked bean sprouts. Ring the
  noodles with lime wedges, cherry tomatoes, and mint sprigs and
  garnish the top with the fried basil.

  the cream, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg.  Pour over pumpkin mixture.
  Mix and add the eggs.  Beat together til well mixed. Line pie plates
  with dough, well built up around edges. Mix together the 2 tbsp sugar
  the remaining tbsp of flour and the pinch of spice. Sprinkle over
  bottom pie crusts, spreading all over with tips of fingers. This
  prevents sogginess. Fill shell 3/4 full. Place strips of foil around
  edge and place in a preheated 450 oven. Bake for 15 minutes and
  reduce the heat to 325. Bake 30 minutes longer. Pie is done when the
  mixture shakes just in the middle when moved back and forth. Serve

      4 oz Mushrooms (sm can sliced)

    1/4 lb Roughly of ground hamburg
    1/2    Package of dry gravy mix
    1/2 c  Mushroom liquid plus water
           -some frozen green peas
      6 oz RED Zinfandel (not white)
 
  Dump onions, and beef into a large frying pan and cook until beef is
  browned.  Make the mushroom liquid up to 1/2 cup with water, and add
  to the pan.  Then add the mushrooms and the dry gravy powder.  Cook
  and stir a little until it thickens some.  Cover with a large cover
  and let sit on the magic burner, at about 180 F.   Just before eating
  throw in a handfull of peas, for color.  (I used to 'brown' the
  mushrooms with the hamburg, but Shirley says it was a waste of time.)
  
  Go drink the wine at the computer, watch the news, etc..  When ready
  to eat (My Stuff was ready at the end of the last paragraph), make a
  serving of instant potatoes and three slices of nice brown toast. Put
  the potatoes and two slices of toast on a big plate. Put about 2/3 to
  3/4 of My Stuff on top.  Refill wine glass.
  
  When the toast is gone, and the potatoes are about 2/3 gone, get the
  last slice of toast and put the rest of My Stuff on the toast, and on
  the potatoes to warm them up.
  
  My Stuff can sit on the magic burner for hours if you want.  It just
  gets better.  Remember to turn off the magic burner.

      5    Eggs
      2 c  Firmly packed light brown
           Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts (to 1 1/2 ts) ginger
           -(depends on how much
           -you like ginger)
      1 ts (to 1 1 /2 ts) cinnamon
           -(ditto above)
    1/2 ts (to 1 ts) ground cloves
           -(ditto above)
      2 ts Vanilla
      1 c  Whole milk - none of this
           Skim or 1% stuff --
      1 c  Melted unsalted butter -
           Okay you CAN use salted
           Butter
      2    Nine inch pie shells
 
  Bake the sweet potatoes until they are fully cooked...all soft and
  mushy. (Hint:  bake them on a foil covered jellyroll pan...they tend
  to be messy when cooking.) When the potatoes are fully cooked, remove
  from oven and cool a bit...then cut one potato in about half, cover
  it in butter and eat it right up!!! You need only three and a half
  taters and they are so darn good fresh from the oven.
  
  Cook the remaining taters and then remove the skins....mash them up
  in a big ole bowl real good. Add the milk and dump the eggs where
  most of the milk has settled and beat 'em with our electric mixer
  (the KitchenAid Mixer bowl won't hold all the mix so use a hand
  mixer...) Slosh all the dry ingredients into the bowl and beat
  really, really well. Sweet taters are filled with FIBER and they need
  a good deal of mixing. Lastly, add the melted butter, one half cup at
  the time, mixing very well. Then, just for good measure, beat the
  dickens out of the whole thing for a couple more minutes.
  
  This should make enough for two good size pies and just enough left
  over for great bowl scraping.  Pour the mix into the shells, bake at
  400 degrees for about an hour or until a knife is inserted and
  removed from the pie clean.  Start checking in about 45
  minutes...just to be on the safe and not burned side. Remove from
  oven, cool, eat for breakfast, lunch or dinner

    1/4 lb Ground seitan

      1 tb Agar flakes
    1/2 c  Gluten flour
      2 tb Liquid lecithin
 
  Rinse tofu and pat dry.  Cube and puree in food processor with all
  ingredients except cima mix.
  
  Shape the cima mix into a 12" by 3" roll.  Sread the tofu puree on a
  12" by 28" piece of plastic wrap and roll around the cima log. Smooth
  out the seam. Steam 30 minutes, let cool 10 minutes, slice and serve.
  
  Note:  you MUST have a steamer wide enough to support the entire roll
  from underneath!  If you don't, it will slip and come unrolled. It'll
  still get cooked, but rather than a pretty, colorful roll to slice
  you'll have a serious mess.  This shouldn't be a problem, but for a
  broke person cooking for nine @someone else's apartment, these
  harware problems have a nasty way of only becoming apparently an hour
  before mealtime. (sigh)
  
  CIMA MIX: (makes 4 1/2C  Bro Ron suggests using the extra for
  'meatballs' or something.  Far be it from me to argue w/my hero, but
  remember to use a big enough skillet.)
  
  Saute onions in oil until translucent.  Remove from heat. Add bread
  crumbs, tofu, seitan, soy grits, nut yeast, water and seasoning. Mix
  until evenly dispersed. Add vegs and nuts.
  
  In a separate bowl, mix agar and gluten flour.  Heat lecithin and
  stir into veg mixture, then stir in flour/agar mixture.

  electric mixer. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft, sticky
  dough. Turn onto a floured surface, continue to work in flour until
  dough is stiff enough to knead. Knead until smooth and elastic, but

  brush with melted butter and sprinkle with garnishes. Set on baking
  sheets. Bake at 450 degrees F. for 5 to 8 minutes. NOTE: There is no
  second rising in this recipe so that you get flat loaves.

      Title: NAAN #3
 Categories: Indian, Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 c  Flour
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Baking powder
    1/4 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
      2    Egg
      1 c  Milk
      4 tb Ghee
 
  In a deep bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda
  and salt, and stir with a large spoon or fingers until well mixed.
  Make a shallow well in the center, drop in the eggs, and stir them
  into the flour mixture. Stirring constantly, pour in the milk in a
  slow, thin stream and continue to stir until all the ingredients are
  well combined.
  
  Gather the dough into a ball and place it on a smooth, slick surface
  such as a jelly roll pan or marble slab. Knead the dough for about 10
  minutes, until the dough is smooth and can be gathered into a soft,
  somewhat sticky ball. Sprinkle a little flour over and under it from
  time to time while kneading to cut down on sticking.
  
  Moisten the hands with a teaspoon of ghee, gather the dough into a
  ball, and place it in a bowl, cover with a towel, and let the dough
  rest in a warm draft-free place about three hours.
  
  Slide two large ungreased baking sheets into the oven and preheat the
  oven and the pans to 450. Divide the dough into six equal portions.
  
  Moistening the hands with ghi occasionally, flatten and form each
  portion into a teardrop-shaped leaf, wide at the base and tapered at
  the top. Each leaf should be about six inches long and 3-1/2" across
  at its widest point, and about 3/8" thick. Arrange the bread leaves
  side by side on the preheated baking sheets and bake them in the
  middle of the oven for six minutes, or until they are firm to the
  touch. Slide the leaves under the broiler for a minute or so to brown
  the tops lightly. Serve hot or at room temperature.

      Title: NAAN (PUNJABI LEAVENED BREAD)
 Categories: Breads, Yeasted, East indian
      Yield: 8 Naan
 
      1 T  Yeast
    3/4 c  Lukewarm water
      3 t  Sugar
    1/2 c  Yoghurt
      1    Egg, beaten
    1/4 c  Melted ghee or butter
      2 t  Salt
  3 1/2 c  Unbl. flour (approx)
      2 T  Poppy seeds or kalonji
 
  In sm. bowl sprinkle yeast over 1/4 c warm water with 1t sugar
  dissolved in it, leave to soften a few min then stir and leave in a
  warm place till frothy.  Stir yogurt till smooth, then mix 1/4 c of
  it with rest of sugar, the remaining water, egg, melted ghee and
  salt. Stir into yeast mix.
  
  Put 2 c flour in a bowl, make a well and pour in liquid mix, beating
  well with a wooden spoon till it's a smooth batter.  Add remaining
  flour a little at a time till you are kneading with your hands and
  the dough is stiff.  Knead for 10 - 15 min till dough is smooth and
  elastic, using as little extra flour as possible.  Form dough to a
  ball, put into an oiled bowl, turn the dough to oil surface, cover
  with a cloth and leave in a warm place till doubled.
  
  Punch down dough, divide into 8 balls and leave to rest 10 min.
  Preheat oven to 450.  Put two ungreased baking sheets in to preheat.
  Pat dough to circles keeping them thin in the centre and thicker
  around rim then pull one end outwards to make teardrop shape.  They
  should be a handspan long and little more than 1/2 as wide at base.
  
  Brush with remaining yoghurt and sprinkle with desired seeds.  Put 2
  or 3 loaves on each baking tray and bake 10 min. or till gold and
  puffed. If naan is not brown enough put under a preheated grill a

      Title: NAAN 2
 Categories: Indian, Breads
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Flour, unbleached
    1/2 c  Flour, whole wheat
      4    Egg
      1 c  Cream, heavy
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Baking soda
           Ghi
 
  Mix flours, eggs, cream, salt, baking powder, and soda to make a soft
  dough (like pizza), and knead 10-15 minutes. Add 2 ounces of oil or
  melted butter and knead again for 5-8 minutes. Form into a ball,
  cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until double in
  size. When the dough is ready, a finger pressed in the dough will
  make an impression. This will take from 1-2 hours, depending on
  temperature and humidity.
  
  Divide the dough into 8-10 balls.  Dipping your fingers into the bowl
  of oil or butter, lightly pat each ball to coat with fat. Cover again
  with a damp cloth and let rest for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the
  oven to 450 degrees.
  
  Wet your palms with oil or butter and pat each ball into a flat
  circle, making the circle thinner in the center and a tiny bit
  thicker at the edge. Pull one side to make the circle into a teardrop
  shape. Each nan should be about the size of your hand.
  
  Place the naan on a cookie sheet and brush the tops with oil or
  butter. Bake 10-12 minutes until the nan become puffy. To make them a
  perfect golden color, place the baked nan under a broiler for a
  minute or two. Serve at once.

      Title: NAAN BREAD
 Categories: Indian, Breads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 oz Fresh yeast, or
      3 tb Yogurt
  1 1/2 lb Fine whole wheat flour
      1 ts Wild onion seeds
           Lukewarm water
           Melted butter or ghee
 
  (1) Using the yeast, water and flour, follow the recipe for unleavened
  bread below.  Add the seeds. (2) Divide the dough into four equal
  parts. (3) Roll each part into a teardrop shape at least 1/4 inch
  thick. (4) Preheat the grill to three-quarters heat, cover the rack
  pan with foil, and set it in the midway position. (5) Put the naan on
  the foil and grill it. Watch it cook (it can easily burn).  As soon
  as the first side develops brown patches, remove it from the grill.
  (6) Turn it over and brush the uncooked side with a little melted
  ghee or butter. (7) Return it to the grill and cook it until it is
  sizzling. Remove. (8) Repeat stages 5-8 with the other three naan.
  Serve at once. LEAVENED BREAD: (1) Dissolve the fresh yeast in a
  little lukewarm water. (2) Put the flour in a *warmed* bowl, make a
  well in the center, and pour in the yeast. Yogurt can be used instead
  of the yeast by non-vegans. (3) Gently mix into the flour and add
  enough water to make a firm dough. (4) Remove from the bowl and knead
  on a floured board until well combined.
   Return to the bowl and leave in a warm place for a couple of hours to
  rise. (5) Knock back the dough by kneading it down to its original
  size.

      Title: NAAN FOR BREADMAKER
 Categories: Breads, Breadmaker
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           -----bread-----
    1/2 tb Yeast
      3 c  Flour
    1/2 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Butter
    3/4 c  Yogurt
    1/2 c  Water
           -----topping-----
      4 tb Butter
      4 tb Onions; chopped
 
  A flat bread from India.  Make sure your oven is well preheated.
  
   Use dough cycle on machine.  Remove dough from machine and divide
  into 12 parts.
  
   Preheat oven to 500.  Roll each part into a small circle (about 8"
  diameter) and place on greased pizza or other baking pan. Brush top
  of each one with melted butter and press finely chopped onion into
  dough. Bake 10-15 minutes until puffy and brown.
  
   Sylvia's notes: Yummmmmmmy!  However, 10 minutes in MY oven turned it
  almost black; 5 minutes 30 seconds (at 475, since my oven runs a
  little hot) turned the nan golden brown and perfect. Also, I rolled
  it too thin at first.  They came out much better when I didn't roll
  them paper thin, more like 1/8" thin.  I put spoonsful of
  Yogurt-Cucumber Salad on them; this is the best bread I've ever
  tasted for eating-food-on. However, as delicious as it is, I doubt
  I'll make it often; all the rolling and brushing with butter and
  pushing onions in is just too much work.
  
   Donna German's note:  While traditional "Nan" has onions, try
  substituting 1-2 ts lemon or orange peel, anise or fennel seeds. Just
  sprinkle on top of melted butter.

  NOTES:
  
  *  A Favorite Canadian sweet -- This comes from a page in an obscure
  magazine called something like "Canadian Homemaker_, by way of a
  Canadian friend, Steve Deering. This is a traditional Canadian sweet,
  much loved and admired. The origin of the recipe seems to be lost in
  the mists of time, though everyone seems to agree that it comes from
  the town of Nanaimo, in British Columbia.

  NOTES:
  
  *  No-bake, 3-layer (chocolate covered) bars -- Nanaimo bars are a
  traditional Canadian dessert, though nobody is certain where the
  tradition came from. Laura Secord is a Canadian candy company; their
  cook book says this about the origin of these fattening delicacies:
  
  "A version of these no-bake bars developed in the Canadian kitchens
  of a well-known food company, was christened by them Nanaimo bars
  after the city of that name on Vancouver Island. Nanaimo (from
  sne-ny-mo, a local Indian term for a loose confederation of five
  bands) started as a Hudson Bay Trading Post in 1849."

  Instead of planting herbs in a flower pot, try sowing the seeds in an
  aluminum sheet cake pan (approx. 13x9x2) with special drainage holes
  punched in the bottom. Simply fill the tray with potting soil and then
  trace your name with your finger on the surface of the soil. Make the
  letters large, 4" to 6". Now plant your seeds along the traced row
  you made with your finger. Gently push the seeds into the soil and
  place in a warm dry spot, a window sill is perfect. Water daily (be
  sure to place old newspaper under the tray to absorb the water
  running off). Soon tiny sprouts will be peaking up through the soil
  in the shape of your name. When the herbs are 3" to 5" tall, you're
  ready to present the whole tray at your next party, so that your
  guests may help themselves to fresh herbs, in your honor.

      Title: NAN
 Categories: Breads, Indian
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------BREAD--------------------------------
    1/2 tb Yeast
      3 c  Flour
    1/2 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Butter
    3/4 c  Yogurt
    1/2 c  Water

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
      4 tb Butter
      4 tb Onions, chopped
 
  A flat bread from India.  Make sure your oven is well preheated.
  
  Use dough cycle on machine.  Remove dough from machine and divide
  into 12 parts.
  
  Preheat oven to 500.  Roll each part into a small circle (about 8"
  diameter) and place on greased pizza or other baking pan. Brush top
  of each one with melted butter and press finely chopped onion into
  dough. Bake 10-15 minutes until puffy and brown.
  
  Sylvia's notes: Yummmmmmmy!  However, 10 minutes in MY oven turned it
  almost black; 5 minutes 30 seconds (at 475, since my oven runs a
  little hot) turned the nan golden brown and perfect. Also, I rolled
  it too thin at first.  They came out much better when I didn't roll
  them paper thin, more like 1/8" thin.  I put spoonsful of
  Yogurt-Cucumber Salad on them; this is the best bread I've ever
  tasted for eating-food-on. However, as delicious as it is, I doubt
  I'll make it often; all the rolling and brushing with butter and
  pushing onions in is just too much work.
  
  Donna German's note:  While traditional "Nan" has onions, try
  substituting 1-2 ts lemon or orange peel, anise or fennel seeds. Just
  sprinkle on top of melted butter.

      Title: NANA MOON'S CHRISTMAS PUDDING
 Categories: Puddings, Christmas
      Yield: 2 Puddings
 
      3 c  Flour (unbleached)
    1/2 lb Suet (see note)
      1 c  Brown sugar
      1 c  Bread crumbs
    3/4 lb Raisins
    3/4 lb Sultanas
           -(or golden raisins)
    1/4 lb Currants
      1 c  Brandy
           -(or orange juice,
           -or a mixture of both)
      1 tb Golden (cane) syrup
      5    Eggs
    1/2 ts Baking soda
      1 tb Milk
 
  Combine the suet, flour, sugar, bread crumbs, fruit and brandy. Cover
  and allow to stand overnight.
  
  Add the syrup and beaten eggs.  Dissolve the baking soda in the milk,
  and add to mixture. Stir until everything's combined. (The mixture
  will be fairly thick. My mother used to get help at this stage by
  telling us that if we stirred it three times and made a wish, the
  wish would come true. This only works with Christmas puddings.)
  
  Place in two 1 1/2 quart pudding basins, cover with paper and several
  layers of aluminum foil, and steam for 4 hours.
  
  When you're going to eat it, steam it for a further 2 hours. Serve by
  turning it out of the bowl, and pouring flaming brandy over it (see
  below). Serve with brandy butter (hard brandy sauce).
  
  This pudding needs time to age between when you cook it and
  Christmas. My mother generally makes it about a month before. Keep it
  in the refrigerator until the day you will be eating it.
  
  Each pudding will serve about 8-10 people.  If you halve the recipe,
  use 3 eggs.  You can also add cherries, figs, almonds and so on when
  you're adding the fruit.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Old-fashioned Christmas boiled pudding -- This recipe was first
  written down by my great-grandmother. It's an old-fashioned boiled
  pudding, and was always a special part of Christmas in my family.
  Nana Moon's family came from Sofala, the site of the 1851 gold rush
  in New South Wales, Australia, where they raised sheep (before the
  gold rush). It's probably based on an English recipe.
  
  This recipe differs from others I've seen in that it uses no spices,
  just dried fruit and brandy.  Perhaps spices were too difficult to
  get, it tastes great anyway. Makes two puddings.
  
  *  The suet can be replaced with some other form of shortening. The
  packaged suet we used to be able to get in Australia was only about 35
  percent suet, the rest was cornflour (cornstarch). Avoid that at all
  costs. For a few years, we bought suet from the butcher and grated it
  ourselves (ok, we used a blender), but no one should have to do that
  (at least, not during an Australian summer).
  
  *  If you decide to go for authenticity and use a pudding bag, here's
  how:
  
  Get a large piece of calico (it must have a tight weave), and boil it
  for a few minutes.  Rub flour into the inner surface. Place 1/2 the
  mixture on it, and bring the corners together, leaving room for the
  mixture to rise. Tie with string. Cook by immersing in boiling water,
  when you add extra water, it must be already boiling, or the pudding
  will get soggy. The pudding will be rounder, and have a better crust
  than one steamed in a pudding bowl.  A good crust means that the
  brandy won't soak in when you light it, so it'll burn for longer. Age
  the pudding by hanging it in a cool, dry place.  The problem with
  using a pudding bag is that it tends to grow mold if the climate is
  too humid.
  
  *  To light the pudding, heat about 1/4 cup of brandy in a saucepan.
  Light it, then pour over the pudding and carry it to the table.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 day waiting, 30 minutes preparation, 4 hours cooking, 1
  month aging.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

    1/2 lb Red grapes, stemmed
 
  The grape starter is from Julia Child's new Master Chef book($17.95
  Retail). It is a recipe given by Nancy Silverton. It takes 10 days to
  complete but is then yours for life.
  
  Wrap the grapes in well washed cheesecloth, tieing the corners to
  form a bag; lightly crush them with a rolling pin (to release the
  sugar to mix with the natural yeast on the skins; just like making
  wine!) and immerse them in the flour water mix. Cover tightly with a
  lid or plastic wrap secured with a rubber band. Leave at room
  temperature for 6 days, stirring once or twice a day for the six days.
  
  The bag of grapes will eventually appear inflated, and liquid will
  begin to separate from the flour base. The mixture will begin to
  taste and smell slightly fruity, and the color will be strange. That
  is as it should be. By the sixth day the bag of grapes will have
  deflated, the color will be yellow, and the taste pleasantly sour;
  the fermentation is complete. The starter is living but weak, and it
  needs to be fed.
  
  Remove the grapes and squeeze their juices back into the starter.
  Stir it up thouroughly and transfer it to a clean container.
  (Although you can use it after just one feeding, the starter will be
  stronger and healthier with the full treatment) You can refrigerate
  it until you're ready to proceed.
  
  Three days before you plan to use it, stir 1 cup flour and 1 cup
  water into the container, blending well. Let stand uncovered at room
  temperature until it bubbles up - 3 to 4 hours - then cover and
  refrigerate. Repeat this for the second and third day.
  
  Store the starter tightly covered in the refrigerator where it will
  keep perfectly for 4 to 6 months.- after which it's a good idea to
  pour off all but 2 cups and give it another feeding. Before using the
  stored starter for bread, however, give it the full 3-day feeding
  schedule once again to restore it and to tone down excess sourness.
  
  This is the starter for the Olive Bread recipe which follows. From:

      Title: NANCY SILVERTON'S OVERNIGHT YEAST BATTER
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 pk Fresh or dried yeast
    1/4 c  Tap water,
           -in a 1 cup measure
    1/4 ts Sugar
      1 c  All-purpose flour
      1 c  Water,
           -droplets more if needed
 
  Crumble or sprinkle the yeast over the water in the measure, whisk in
  the sugar, and let rise for several minutes until it begins to foam.
  Whisk it again, then scrape into a 2 quart glass or plastic
  container. Whisk in the cup of flour, then the water, to make a
  mixture the consistency of pancake batter. Set uncovered at room
  temperature for several hours, until it foams and produces bit heavy
  bubbles. Stir it up, and leave overnight. May be used in place of the
  Silverton starter in any of her recipes.
  
  AHEAD OF TIME NOTE: If not to be used the next day, cover and
  refrigerate. The batter will gradually turn into a sourdough; feed it
  and treat it in the same way as the finished Silverton starter. From:

    1/2 lb Mild Cheese
    1/3 lb Mortadella Cheese

  The roasted red peppers are Italian-style, available at many Italian
  delis. When you're ready for a sandwich the next day, assemble the
  following:
  
  One loaf fresh Italian bread (one big round for a monster, individual
  hero (grinder, sub,...) loaves will do fine for smaller sandwiches)
  
  Cut  the loaf (loaves) in half,  and scoop out a little of the inside
  to make some room.   Drizzle some of the olive oil and juice from the
  olive salad on each side of the open loaf -- use plenty. On the
  bottom, place some  salami,  olive  salad, provolone, mild cheese,
  and mortadella. Top with the other half loaf. Slice into wedges (or
  eat the individual loaves).

      Title: NAPA KIMCHEE (JEFF SMITH~ THE FRUGAL GOURMET)
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 lb Napa cabbage
    3/4 c  Korean pickling salt or
      8    Scallions, finely chopped
           Kosher salt
  1 1/2 c  Carrot, shredded
      2 tb Fresh ginger, grated
      2 tb Garlic, finely chopped
      2 tb Candied ginger
      2 ts Sugar
    1/2 c  Korean red pepper flakes
      1 tb Salt
 
  So many crazy stories have been told about Kimchee that many
  Americans are reluctant to try the dish. No, it is not buried in the
  ground in this country, and yes, it is delicious and much milder than
  you would expect. You can vary the spiciness by varying the amount of
  red pepper that you put into the dish. Wonderful stuff !! Remove limp
  outer leaves from the cabbage. Quarter the cabbage lengthwise, then
  cut across the quarters into 1 1/2 inch-wide pieces. Put the cabbage
  in a very large bowl and add the pickling salt. Toss so the salt
  coats the cabbage evenly. Allow to stand for 30 minutes. Toss the
  cabbage a couple of times during that time. Rinse the cabbage with
  cold water and drain. Toss with the remaining ingredients and pack
  into a large crock or covered pottery casserole. Add water to cover,
  about 3 cups. Allow to sit on the counter for 1 to 2 days. Store in
  the refrigerator, covered, in the crock or in individual glass jars.
  Serve as a relish with any Korean dinner or use in cooking meat or
  soup dishes.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Substitute 1:
    1/3 c  Juice, lemon -- or lime
    2/3 c  Juice -- orange
           Subtitute 2:
    1/8 c  Vinegar -- cider
    7/8 c  Juice -- orange
 
  Naranja Agria is used in Latin American cooking. Elisabeth Lambert
  Ortiz in her "Book of Latin American Cooking" suggests one third
  lemon or lime juice to two thirds sweet orange as a substitute. You
  could also use 1 teaspoon cider vinegar to 3 Tablespoons sweet orange
  juice. The naranja agria is actually the juice of a Seville orange.
  Most of the Seville oranges are shipped to England for the marmalade.
  The Seville orange has a sour bite.

  This is from Narsai David, a Bay Area restaurateur and food critic.
  Haven't tried it yet, but most of the stuff Narsai comes up with is
  great. Gado Gado is an extremely good Indonesian way to consume
  veggies even if you're not too fond of 'em.  This calls for raw
  veggies, but more authentic recipes call for blanching the veggies
  first. This is probably for sanitary purposes more than anything.
  
  Melt the butter in a saucepan.  Add the onion and garlic and saute
  until they are brown.  Add the consomme, soy sauce, peanut butter,
  cream, ginger and Tabasco sauce and cook slowly for about 10 minutes.
  Puree the mixture in blender or food processor.
  
  The dip may be served warm or cold with an assortment of raw
  vegetables of your choice..
  
  Serves 6.
  
  NOTE:  If this dish is to be served cold, double the amount of
  consomme to 2 cups.

      1 c  Heavy cream, whipped
           Shaved bittersweet chocolate
      1    Package (10-12 oz.) frozen
           Raspberries, thawed
 
  Flour and butter an 8-inch round cake pan.  Cut a round of waxed
  paper to fit the bottom, butter it, and place in the pan. Preheat the
  oven to 425F. In a small saucepan over very low heat or in a
  microwave oven, melt the chocolate with the butter. Set aside. In the
  top of a double boiler over very hot water, whisk the eggs with the
  sugar. Beat over hot water until the sugar dissolves and the mixture
  is just lukewarm. Remove the top of the double boiler from the heat
  and beat the eggs until they quadruple in volume and become quite
  thick. Fold the flour into the eggs. Stir 1/4 of the egg mixture into
  the chocolate. Then, fold the chocolate back into the rest of the egg
  mixture. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Bake for 15
  minutes; the cake will be liquid in the center. Cover and freeze the
  cake in the pan overnight. To unmold the cake, carefully dip the
  bottom of the pan in hot water and invert onto a cake plate. Remove
  the pan and gently peel off the waxed paper.  Decorate the cake with
  the whipped cream and shaved chocolate. Refrigerate until serving.
  Puree the raspberries and their juice in a blender or food processor.
  Pass the puree through a fine sieve and serve a tablespoon of the

           (fresh) ginger
    1/2 ts Trassi (if available)
 
  Heat oil in wok or big pan. Add trassi, powder it first between your
  fingers. Fry onion, garlic and ginger for 2-3 minutes until onion is
  translucent and the kitchen smells great. Fry the meat if it is raw;
  if not wait a few lines :) Add leek and chili pepper, fry 2-3 more
  minutes. Add egg, stir well and IMMEDIATELY add rice. The egg should
  set after the rice is stirred in so everything gets a bit sticky. Add
  the cooked meat, if you're using that. Fry for 5-8 minutes, stirring
  really well. Add a little more oil if necessary. Add the beansprouts,
  heat these for maximum 1 minute or they will get soft
  :-( Add soy sauce to taste. This is a very basic dish. You should eat
  something else with it, like sate (broiled meat w. peanutbutter
  sauce), or a vegetable dish (stirfried). Atjar Tjampoer (sweet/sour
  pickled vegetables) cannot be missed, as well as a fried or poached
  egg on top of the nasi (one egg per eater). Serve with prawn
  crackers, preferably home baked (if you can buy them raw anywhere?).

  a plate to cool (do not fold omelette). Repeat process with remaining
  beaten eggs. When cool, put one omelette on top of the other, roll up
  and cut into thin strips.
  
  Shell and devein prawns, cut beef or pork into fine strips. Chop
  onions roughly and put in blender container with garlic and trasi.
  Cover and blend to a paste. (If blender is not available, finely chop
  onions and crush garlic.  Dissolve trasi in a little hot water.
  Combine these three ingredients.
  
  Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan or wok and fry the
  blended ingredients until cooked.  Add prawns and meat to pan and
  fry, stirring constantly, until they are cooked. Add 2 tablespoons
  more oil and when hot stir in the rice and spring onions, tossing and
  mixing thoroughly until very hot.  Sprinkle with soy sauce and mix
  evenly.
  
  Serve the fried rice garnished with strips of omelette, fried onion
  flakes and cucumber.
  
  FOR FRIED ONION FLAKES: Slice the onions very thinly, making sure not
  only that the slices are paper thin, but also they are all the same
  thinness, otherwise some will burn while others are uncooked. Fry in
  deep hot oil until deep brown, but not black. Lift out, and drain.
  They must be cooked slowly so that all moisture is cooked out.

  stirring.  Add celery, garlic, ginger, sambal, curry and kecap manis;
  saute 2 minutes. Add green pepper and cabbage; saute 3 minutes more.
  Add shrimp and chicken, ham, pork or lamb and saute 2 minutes. Add
  rice and continue to saute until light brown. Adjust seasoning.
  
  Enright writes: "Serve with a light beer or ginger tea to quench the
  inevitable thirst fired by sambals. Nasi goreng is often served at the
  rijsttafel (Dutch for rice table), a feast of spicy dishes, crisp
  salads and fresh peanut sauce."

      1    Cake mix
      1 pk Green jello prepared
           Black frosting
      8    Licorice sticks
      8    Gumdrops
 
  (once made as a tease for a woman who HATED spiders)
  
  Take your average cake mix. Bake it up in 2 metal bowls--1 bigger
  than the other. Once unmolded, cut the bigger one (the "body") in
  half, horizontally. CAREFULLY scoop out an adequate cavity in each
  half. FILL with well-whipped set green Jello, and reattach the
  halves. Frost black, arrange on serving platter. Use licorice stix as
  legs. Use 2 BIG green gumdrops and 6 little ones as eyes. When the
  cake is cut into, it spurts green goop, just like a real spider when
  stepped on.
  
  Why not add a red hourglass to the back and make it toxic? ;-)

  per batch.
  
  Transfer chicken to a plate or bowl, drain off half the fat in the
  pan, and then return the chicken to the pan. Add enough water to just
  cover the chicken. Then add the herbs and rutabaga. Cover, and
  leaving the heat at medium-high, bring to a boil.  Cook until
  rutabaga is nearly soft through but still somewhat crisp, about 10
  minutes. Add the potato and the carrots, cover, and cook until
  carrots are nearly tender, about 15 minutes.
  
  While the stew is cooking, make the dumpling dough. To do this, sift
  the flour, baking powder, 1 tsp. salt, baking soda and nutmeg
  together into a medium-size bowl.  Make a well in the middle and add
  the egg, melted butter and buttermilk; mix them together in the well
  with a small whisk, a fork or your fingers.  Working quickly,
  incorporate the dry ingredients to make a fairly stiff dough.  Fold
  in the blueberries or raisins.
  
  Adjust the seasoning of the stew and make sure it is boiling merrily;
  then stir in the peas and parsnips. Next, one heaping tablespoon at a
  time, drop the dumpling dough on top of the stew so the dumplings are
  not touching. Cover, and cook just until the dumplings are puffed and
  cooked through, no longer than 15 minutes. Check them occasionally to
  be sure they don't overcook and become dry.
  
  To serve, cut through the dumplings with a serving spoon, and ladle
  the chicken and vegetables into warmed shallow soup bowls (remove the
  thyme and bay leaves). Place the dumplings on top; serve immediately.
  
  Pinot Noir goes well with this.

      Title: NATILLA (SWEET CUSTARD)
 Categories: Desserts, Cuba, Update
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8 lg Egg yolks
      4 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
      1 c  Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  Cinnamon for dusting or 1 cup sugar for the crust 1. In a bowl, mix
  the egg yolks with 1 cup of the milk. In another bowl, mix the
  cornstarch with another cup of milk, then add the sugar and the
  remaining milk. Strain the egg-yolk mixture through a fine strainer
  into the cornstarch mixture and stir to combine well. 2. In a heavy,
  medium-size saucepan over medium heat, cook the mixture, stirring
  constantly, until thickened, 20 minutes. Remove from heat, add the
  vanilla, and stir to blend. 3. Pour into a serving bowl, let cool to
  room temperature, cover, and refrigerate 2 hours or overnight. Before
  serving, dust with cinnamon. If you are caramelizing the custard,
  cook the sugar in a small, heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring
  constantly after it starts to bubble, until it is golden brown, 6 to
  8 minutes. Drizzle it over the custard and refrigerate until the
  caramel sets. If you want a crisp sugar crust, pour the custard into
  an ovenproof mold, and refrigerate as directed above. Before serving,
  sprinkle the sugar over the top, and place under a preheated broiler
  just until the sugar melts. Watch closely, as the sugar burns
  quickly. Serve within 10 to 15 minutes. Makes 6 to 8 servings NATILLA

      Title: NATIVE AMERICAN HOPI BLUE CORN MUSH "SAVORY WAY"
 Categories: Desserts, Misc, Ethnic, Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 qt Water
  1 1/2 c  Blue cornmeal
           Salt
           Oil for frying
 
  Bring water to a boil in a saucepan, add salt to taste, and whisk in
  the cornmeal. Lower the heat and stir the cornmeal for 10 minutes or
  until it tastes done.  The coarser the meal, the longer it will take.
  Pour the cooked cereal onto a cookie sheet or into a bread pan and
  set it aside to cool for an hour or so or until firm. Once it has
  cooled, slice it into pieces for frying. Fry the slices in butter or
  oil in a nonstick pan until lightly crisped on both sides. If this is
  to be eaten as a savory, sprinkle a little red chili or paprika on
  top just before serving.
  
  This is cooked like cornmeal mush, molded in a bread pan, and then
  sliced and fried. It is delicious with a clear corn flavor and odd
  purple-blue color. It's good with eggs and bacon, or with butter.

      1 tb Double-acting baking powder
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Water
      1 c  Vegetable shortening
 
  In a bowl whisk together the flour, the baking powder, and the salt,
  stir in the water, and knead the mixture on a floured surface until

  with a kitchen towel, for 15 minutes. Pull off egg-size pieces of the
  dough and oat and stretch them into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Poke a
  hole witha finger through the center of each round so that the breads
  will fry evenly. In a large heavy skillet heat the shortening over
  moderately high heat until it is hot but not smoking, in it fry the
  rounds, 1 at a time, for 2 minutes on each side, or until they are
  golden, and transfer the breads as they are fried to paper towels to

  in water, 1 tbsp at a time.  Use a fork to toss until the flour is
  moistened and dough almost cleans side of bowl.  Dough should be
  soft, but not sticky. On a lightly floured surface, knead until
  smooth. Form into ball, cover, and refrigerate 30 mins.  Heat oil in
  a lg. skillet to 400~. Tear off a piece of dough about the size of a
  peach. Pat and stretch until thin and round, about 6" to 8" in
  diameter. Poke a hole through the middle, and drop into sizzling
  vegetable shortening.  Fry circles, turning once, until golden brown,
  about 1 min. on each side. Bread will puff beautifully. Serve with

  Based on a recipe from some chile cookbook), makes 6-8 servings? Broil
  (blacken) the green chiles until the skin is blistered and loose -
  remove skin while warm and discard seeds and stem. Chop in 1" square
  pieces and put in large chile pot or crock pot. Cut off fat from pork
  and save. Cut pork into 1/2" squares and set aside. Melt pork fat in
  frying pan and saute onions and garlic - add to pot. Substitute veg.
  oil or skip the sauteing to minimize fat (and taste). Brown pork in
  same pan - add vegetable oil if needed - add to pot. Cut tomatoes and
  green peppers into large pieces and add to pot.  Take out you
  contacts now if you wear em. Finely chop habenaros and add the rest
  of the ingredients. Bring to a boil and then simmer (uncovered!) as
  long as you can stand it (adding water or beer as necessary).  Simmer
  for 2 hours minimum to even out the heat. Serve with plenty of warm
  flour tortillas. Notes: 1. Thought I'd submit my favorite green chile
  recipe.  Two caveats:  it takes a while to make but its worth it, and
  this recipe has been thoroughly modified from the original so feel
  free to experiment yourself. 2. Beware, this "chile" kicks butt and
  gets hotter after freezing.  This also makes a great chile-egg
  burrito the next morning. "Durnell, David V."

 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Dried navy beans
      4 tb Olive oil
      1    Onion, chopped
      2    Garlic cloves, chopped
      3    Ribs celery, diced
      1    Turnip, diced
      1 sm Imported bay leaf and 5
           -sprigs fresh
           Parsley, tied together with
           -kitchen twine
    1/4 ts Ground allspice
    1/4 ts Crushed red pepper flakes
      6 c  Chicken broth
      4    Fresh sausages (mild
           -Italian)
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  Soak the navy beans overnight in plenty of cold water; the next day
  drain the beans and rinse them under cool water. Set aside. Place the
  oil and onion in a soup kettle, set over low heat and cook slowly
  until the onion has softened, about 5 minutes.  Increase the heat to
  medium, add the garlic and celery and stir-cook for 1 minute. Drop in
  the bay leaf and parsley bundle.  Stir in the allspice, red pepper
  flakes, broth, and navy beans. Bring the soup base to a boil,
  skimming it as necessary; boil 3 minutes. Cover and simmer for 1 1/2
  hours, or until the beans are quite tender. Discard the parsley-bay
  leaf bundle. (The soup may be prepared in advance to this point.)
  
  To finish the soup, grill the sausages under the broiler or pan-fry
  them for about 20 minutes, letting them cook for 10 minutes on each
  side. Slice the sausage into 1/3-inch disks. Add the sausage rounds
  to the soup and let simmer for 5 minutes longer to blend the flavors.
  Season with salt and freshly-ground pepper to taste. Ladle the soup
  into warm bowls and serve piping hot.
  
  Makes 5 servings.

      Title: NAVY BEANS BAKED IN THE BOSTON STYLE
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Navy beans, dried (4 cups)
      1 tb Salt
      1 lg Onion, stuck with 4 or 5
           -whole cloves
    2/3 c  Molasses, dark
      1 c  Brown sugar (light or dark),
           -divided
      1 tb Mustard, dry
      1 ts Black pepper
           ;Water
    1/2 lb Salt pork; cut into small
           -pieces
      1 lb Bacon
 
  Chop the bacon; fry crisp, then drain well.  Rinse the beans
  thoroughly and pick through them for anything that should be
  discarded. Place in a 4 quart saucepan and add enough water to cover
  the beans by 2 or 3 inches. Over high heat, bring to a boil and boil
  for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and leave the beans in the hot
  water to soak for about an hour. Return to the heat and bring back to
  the boil.  Add the salt; lower the heat to simmer and cook for 45
  minutes.  Drain the beans and discard the water.
  
  Preheat the oven to 275 degrees.  Place the partly cooked beans in a
  heavy casserole, bean pot or Dutch oven. Make a well in the center of
  the beans and in it place the onion stuck with cloves; cover with the
  beans. Mix the molasses, 2/3 cup of the brown sugar, the dry mustard
  and the pepper in a small bowl.  Add a cup of water to the mixture;
  stir to mix well and add to the beans in the pot.  Poke the pieces of
  chopped salt pork into the beans. Cover the beans with the fried
  bacon pieces and pour a cup of water over all.
  
  Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and bake for 4 hours. Remove
  the cover and sprinkle the remaining brown sugar over the bean
  mixture. Continue to bake, uncovered, for another 45 minutes. Yields
  6 generous servings.  Serve with steamed brown bread.
  
  Note:  If the beans seem dry after the 4-hour baking period, add
  another 1/2 cup of water before adding the final sprinkling of brown
  sugar.
  
  Shortcuts can be taken in making this recipe.  In the initial
  cooking, boil the beans for 15 minutes rather than 5 minutes, and
  simmer for an hour rather than for 45 minutes. When baking the beans,
  increase the oven heat to 300 degrees, but watch closely to see that
  the beans don't dry out too much.  Should they become dry as they are
  baking, simply add a little water. Following these steps will reduce
  the baking time to 2
      1/2    hours.

 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 50 Biscotti
 
  1 1/2 c  Whole almonds
      2 c  All purpose flour
    3/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/3 c  Honey
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      1 lg Egg
      1 lg Egg yolk
      1 ts Finely grated orange peel
 
  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350 F. Line large
  baking sheet with foil. Butter foil. Finely grind 3/4 cup almonds in
  processor. Transfer to large bowl. Add flour, sugar, baking powder,
  baking soda and cinnamon. Whisk honey, oil, egg, yolk and orange peel
  in small bowl to blend. Add to dry ingredients and stir until dough
  just begins to hold together (if dough seems firm and dry, let stand
  10 minutes to soften). Turn out dough onto lightly floured work
  surface. Add remaining 3/4 cup almonds and knead to distribute
  evenly. Divide dough in half. Roll each half into 12-inch-long,
  2-inch-wide log. Place logs on prepared sheet, spacing 4 inches
  apart. Bake until firm to touch and dark brown (logs may crack),
  about 40 minutes. Cool logs on sheet on rack 15 minutes. Transfer
  logs to work surface. Using serrated knife, cut logs diagonally into
  1/2-inch-thick slices. Place cut side down on same foil-lined sheet
  and bake until light brown and dry, about 12 minutes. Cool on sheet
  on rack. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Store airtight at room
  temperature.) These not-too-sweet cookies are based on an old recipe
  seldom seen these days. Although the combination of almonds, honey
  and cinnamon is still a typical one, contemporary Neapolitan biscotti

      Title: NEAPOLITAN CAULIFLOWER SOUP
 Categories: Soups/stews, Italian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Head cauliflower - large
           -(about 2 lbs.), cored and
           Separated into florets
      2 tb White wine vinegar - OR
           -cider vinegar
      4    Clove garlic - minced
    1/2 ts Crushed hot red pepper
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      4 c  Vegetable Broth - hot (see
           -recipe) OR canned
           Low-sodium chicken broth
      2 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Parsley - flat-leaf, freshly
           -chopped
 
  Number of Servings:   6
  
  Pecorino cheese - freshly grated
  
  1.  Trim the stems from the cauliflower florets and cut them into 1/2
  inch pieces, then break the florets into 1/2-inch pieces. Fill a
  large bowl with 2 quarts of cold water and stir in the vinegar. Add
  the cauliflower pieces and stir to clean thoroughly. Bring a large
  saucepan of salted water to a boil over high heat. Drop the
  cauliflower into the boiling water, return to a boil and cook over
  moderately high heat until just tender, about 4 minutes.  Drain the
  cauliflower thoroughly.
  
  2.  In a large saucepan, cook the garlic and hot red pepper in the
  olive oil over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until the
  garlic is golden, about 3 minutes. Add the cauliflower and cook for 5
  minutes, stirring to prevent it from browning.  Stir in the hot
  Vegetable Broth, salt and parsley.
  
  3.  Using a slotted spoon, remove 1 cup of the cooked cauliflower
  from the soup and puree it in a blender or food processor until
  smooth. Return it to the soup, increase the heat to moderate and heat
  through. Ladle the soup into bowls and sprinkle on a generous amount
  of cheese.
  
  NOTE:  Make this soup as garlicky and spicy as you like and serve
  with lots of crusty Italian bread.
  
  Serves 6.

  Soak the porcini mushrooms in 1/2 cup of warm water for about 30
  minutes. Drain, reserving the liquid. Rinse, dry, and chop the
  porcini mushrooms. Strain the soaking liquid through washed
  cheesecloth, paper towels, or a coffee filter.  Set aside.
  
  Melt the butter and 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large pot over low
  heat. Add the onion and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until the
  onion is wilted but not browned, about 5 minutes.
  
  Add the porcini mushrooms and cook for 8 minutes. Increase the heat to

  them. Reverse and slowly whisk the egg yolk mixture into the soup.
  Cook, stirring constantly, over medium-low heat until the soup
  thickens. (Do not boil or the soup will curdle.)
  
  Place a piece of toast in each of 8 bowls.  Ladle in the hot soup and
  sprinkle with additonal grated Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley.
  
  Serves 8.

      Title: NEAT'S TONGUE (TO SERVE HOT OR COLD)
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1    Pickled ox tongue (4-5 lbs.)
      2    Onions
      2    Carrots
      2    Celery stalks
           Bay leaves
           Parsley
           Rosemary
     12    Black peppercorns

MMMMM----------------ALSO, IF SERVING TONGUE COLD---------------------
           A little Madeira
           Gelatine powder
 
  Rinse the tongue and then soak it in plenty of cold water for at
  least 12 hours.  Change the water once or more during this time. Next
  day choose a heavy-based saucepan or flameproof casserole that will
  hold the tongue snugly.  Put the tongue into it, cover with cold
  water, bring to the boil and skim.  Taste the water; if it is very
  salty, tip it away, add fresh water and bring to the boil again.  Add
  the chopped vegetables, peppercorns and a bouquet of bay, parsley and
  rosemary. Cover tightly and cook very gently on top of the stove or
  in an oven heated to 300 F (150 C) gas mark 2 for about 4 hours until
  the tongue is so tender that a skewer will go through the root end
  like butter. Lower the temperature as necessary; the meat will be
  best if barely a bubble breaks the surface of the liquid as it cooks.
  Skin the cooked tongue while it is still hot. Then cut away the fat
  and gristle from the end and remove all small bones if the butcher
  has not already done this.  Skim off all the fat from the cooking
  liquor and save it for the sauce and for soups.
  
  IF THE TONGUE IS TO BE SERVED HOT, carve it in thin slices while it is
  still hot and arrange it prettily, overlapping slices like tiles, on a
  large warmed serving dish. Pour some good hot sauce over it, cover
  the dish with foil and place in the oven for about 10 minutes to heat
  through. The spiced Kumquat Sauce recipe is one of my favourites and
  I like to serve extra in a sauce boat.
  
  IF THE TONGUE IS TO BE SERVED COLD, mould and glaze it while still
  warm. Curl the tongue to make it fit a small round container with
  straight sides. Traditional tongue-presses usually measure about 5-6
  inches in diameter; a cake tin or souffle dish of similar size will
  do just as well.
  
  To glaze, melt 2 teaspoons gelatine powder in 1 tablespoon water, then
  blend in a scant 1/2 pint tongue cooking liquor (seasoned and reduced
  as necessary for good flavour), and give it a little oomph with 1-2
  tablespoons Madeira.  Pour over the tongue as much of the liquid
  jelly as is needed to fill gaps. Press the tongue down with a saucer
  or plate which fits just inside the tin, weight it down heavily and
  leave overnight in a cold larder until meat and jelly are set. Chill
  any left-over jelly separately so that it can be diced and used to
  garnish the tongue when it is served.
  
  Unmould the tongue on to a flat dish for serving. Decorate it and
  accompany it with a fine sauce such as a classic Cumberland sauce or
  Piquant Parsley and Caper Sauce.

  "Try Fleischmanns's 7-day vitamin pick-up." "If you feel tired and low
  because you need more vitamins, try Fleischmann's 7-Day Vitamin
  Pick-Up. Buy 14 cakes of Fleischmann's Yeast and take two cakes a day
  for just one week. (Fleischmann's keeps perfectly in the refrigerator
  for a week.) Fleischmann's Yeast has helped many people in only a
  week's time. Give it a chance to help you., Look at these results of
  tests of over 150 people who took Fleischmann's Yeast to see how
  quickly they benefited. Why not start your 7-day vitamin pick-up
  today? 6 out of 10 said they were benefited after taking
  Fleischmann's one week. 9 out of 10 said they were benefited after
  taking Fleischmann's four weeks.
  
  How to take Fleischmann's Yeast.
  
  You can take Fleischmann's Yeast any time of day. Most people simply
  eat a cake of Fleischmann's and follow with a sip of water. Some who
  have not developed a taste for fresh yeast eat it spread on crackers
  or drink it mixed in cool water, milk, or tomato juice."

      Title: NELLY'S SHAPE (TAURUS)
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Milk
  3 1/2 ts Gelatin
      4    Eggs, separated
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
      1 tb Sweet sherry
      2 tb Marmalade
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
    1/2 c  Toasted slivered almonds
 
  Servings:  6
  
  Place 3 tbsp milk in large bowl, sprinkle gelatin over milk. Let soak
  while you prepare custard.
  
  Mix egg yolks with sugar in top of double boiler, place over barely
  simmering water, mix in remaining milk. Stir continuously until
  mixture thickens into a custard. Remove from heat and immediately
  pour over softened gelatin, stir, so gelatin becomes thoroughly mixed
  in. Mix in the sherry and chill for 20 to 30 minutes.
  
  Beat egg whites until they form soft peaks, fold into custard. Turn
  into serving dish and chill for several hours. The custard will
  separate, leaving a foamy top and a jelly bottom.
  
  Place the marmalade in a small saucepan and warm it very gently over
  low heat.  Spread it evenly over the top of the pudding. Turn the
  cream into a bowl and beat it stiff. Spread over marmalade, sprinkle
  with nuts.
  
  The sensual and seductive taste of this dessert should satisfy the
  Taurean's love of things both sweet and pleasurable, its pale soft
  topping suggesting the foamy waves of the sea from which Venus was
  born.

  temperature for the food you are cooking.
  
  Dry the fish or the vegetables with a paper towel and dip into the
  batter. Place in the hot oil one piece at a time. Try to keep the
  pieces from colliding until the batter has had a chance to set (which
  it does almost instantly).
  
  Cook until the batter has turned a golden brown, remove to a paper
  towel to drain and serve at once. This is very good to use for
  zucchini, broccoli, peppers, green beans, onion rings and any other
  firm vegetable.

      3 ts Baking Powder
      1 c  Flour
      1 md Egg
      6 tb Cold water
      1 tb Oil
      1 ts Salt
 
  Beat the egg well then add the 6T of cold water. Measure the Water
  carefully. Add the oil and salt and whisk together. Mix the
  baking-powder and flour together. Blend the two mixes into a smooth
  batter quickly. Drop into boiling stew and cover continuing to boil
  for 15- 20 mins. Try to resist the urge to peek too often - the
  dumplings will rise and produce a light tender crust - a cold draught
  will cause them to fall. They can also be served as a dessert by
  cooking in boiling water and served with pancake syrup or jam
  drizzled over them. As a young boy scout in England during the war
  these were or main camp dessert as the ingredients were usually
  available from our skimpy home "Rations". There we called them
  "Sinkers". We cooked and ate them by the dozen with our "fresh-air"
  appetites and the name described the resulting feeling in our young
  bellies quite well ! When I am travelling I usually make up the dry
  ingredients into batches and carry them in zip-lock bags ready to add
  liquid and the egg when I am ready to use them.

      Title: NEVER FAIL PASTRY MIX
 Categories: Pies, Desserts
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
MMMMM-------------------PASTRY MIX INGREDIENTS------------------------
      6 c  Flour
      1 tb Salt
      1 lb Can of vegetable shortening

MMMMM--------------------TO MAKE 1 PIE CRUST-------------------------
      2 c  Pastry mix
      2 tb To 3; ice water
 
  TO MAKE MIX:
  
  Sift flour and salt together into a large bowl
  
  Drop shortening into the mixture by spoonfuls and with a pastry
  blender or two knives,cut it into the flour mixture until the mixture
  is crumbly. Stop when the mixture still looks coarse--do not let it
  become smooth. If you know exactly how the mixture should look you
  can do this in the food processor, but be careful not to over process.
  
  Store pastry mix in a tightly sealed container on pantry shelf in
  medium to cool weather for 1 to 3 months. If the weather is warm or
  humid, it is better to keep this in the refrigerator. Let it warm to
  room temperature and recrumble a bit if needed before using.
  
  TO USE:
  
  For a single pie crust you will need:
  
  2 cups Pastry mix 2 to 3 tb ice water
  
  Toss the mix and ice water gently unitl the mixture begins to stick
  together.
  
  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface--formica, marble or a
  cutting board--and gently roll out a circle to fit your pie pan. Some
  people use a pastry cloth or a square of clean muslin to cover the
  surface they are working on, roll the pastry out right on the cloth,
  and then lift the cloth and pastry, turn it uside down into the pan,
  and peel the cloth away.
  
  As you lift the dough into the pan, remember that tears can be
  repaired with a bit of water and a small piece of dough, or you could
  remove the holey inadequate curst, knead it back together and try
  again. The more you knead, however, the tougher the pie crust will
  become, so practice until you have a light sure touch.
  
  Cheap Trick:
  
  If you fear that you'll never get the hang of rolling out a pie crust
  that doesn't tear apart, you might try placing a ball of dough into a
  large size plastic bag and roll the dough while it is still int he
  bag. When it isthe right size, cut open the bag, remove the top
  sheet, flip the dough inot your pan,and remove the bottom sheet.

      Title: NEVER FAIL SOURDOUGH FRENCH BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Hot water
      2 tb Honey or sugar
      2 tb Butter or margarine
  1 1/2 c  Sourdough starter
      4 c  (to 6) flour
      1 x  Cake yeast
      2 ts Salt(optional)
 
  Mix hot water, honey or sugar, butter or margarine in a large ceramic
  mixing bowl. Cool to lukewarm and add yeast, sourdough starter, salt
  and flour a cup at a time enough to make a stiff dough. Turn out onto
  a floured board and knead for 5 to 8 minutes. Place in an oiled bowl
  and cover; let rise until doubled in bulk. Punch down and let rise
  for 30 minutes. Turn dough out onto a floured board and let sit ten
  minutes. Form into long or round loaf, or into rolls and place in a
  well greased pan or cookie sheet and let rise again until doubled.
  Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 45 to 55 minutes or until
  brown. Makes 1 large loaf or 8 to 12 rolls. SUGGESTIONS: The bread
  will rise more quickly if salt is omitted. Use only ceramic or wood
  bowls and utensils as metal spoils sourdough.(I use a large
  corningware bowl and a plastic whip to mix, then rinse and reuse same
  bowl to let kneaded ball rise in). Wash utensils promptly as this
  stuff sets up like cement when left to dry!  This recipe will make 4
  thin baguette loaves, two small regular loaves or one MONSTER loaf in
  a regular bread pan. Grease pans generously with crisco or other
  shortening. From The Dough Boys Bakery in San Francisco

  1 1/2 c  Tomatoes; peeled & chopped
      1 pn Cayenne pepper
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
      1 ts Cornstarch
 
    "The key to this delicious soup is to gently scrape the kernels off
  the corn cob with a table fork so the skins remain on the cob,
  leaving you with only the fresh pulp."
  
    Use a 12" square of cheesecloth to make a bouquet garni of the
  first 7 ingredients and set aside.  In a large saucepan over medium
  heat, first soften the bacon, then add the corn, onions, and celery
  and saute until tender, about 5 minutes.  Add the chicken broth,
  potatoes, tomatoes, and the bouquet garni. Bring to a boil, reduce
  heat and slow boil for 1 hour. Remove the bouquet garni. Add the
  cayenne pepper. Meanwhile, using your fingers, dissolve the
  cornstarch in heavy cream at room temperature. Add cornstarch/cream
  mixture to soup and stir until heated through.

  1/2 tsp. Wilton butter flavoring. This icing is somewhat stiffer. For
  blazing white, add Wilton White White.  Wilton White White will also
  make the first buttercream recipe whiter, but be careful with colors
  as they will still tend to be yellowish.
  
  Note:  Excellent cake and frosting!

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Tart cooking app.les, paread
           -and cored
    3/4 c  Hard cider
  1 1/2 tb Quick-cooking tapioca
      1 c  Plus 6 tablespoons sugar
      2    Eggs, seperated

    1/4 ts Cream of tarter
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
      6 tb All-purpose flour
    1/4 ts Almond extract
 
  Makes 6 Servings
  
  A duff of apples, such as this one, is far lighter than the orignal
  and more of a souffle-like pudding. It is best served as soon as it
  comes out of the oven.
  
  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Butter a 2-quart casserole.
  
  Cut the apples into eighths and place in a large saucepan. Combine the
  cider, tapioca, and 1 cup sugar, and stir until sugar is disolved;
  pour over the apples. Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer for 10
  to 12 minutes, until apples are soft but not mushy. Turn into the
  prepared casserole.
  
  In a bowl, beat the egg yolks with a dash of salt and 6 tablespoons
  sugar; set aside. Beat the egg whites with another dash of salt,
  until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and whisk until stiff but not
  dry. Fold the egg yolk mixture into the egg whites. Add the vanilla,
  and fold in the flour and almond extract. Pour batter over the apples
  and bake 35 to 45 minutes, or untill puffed and golden brown.

      1 tb Cider vinegar
      1 tb Prepared horseradish
      2 ts Margarine
 
  1. Trim fat from brisket. Place brisket in a large stockpot, and add
  water, pickling spice, and garlic. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce
  heat, and simmer 1 hour. Add Brussels sprouts and next 4 ingredients
  (Brussels sprouts through rutabaga) to pot, and bring to a boil.
  Cover and simmer 1 hour or until brisket is tender. Remove brisket
  and vegetables from pot; reserve 1 cup cooking liquid. Let brisket
  stand 5 minutes, and cut into thin slices. Set vegetables aside, and
  keep warm.
  
  2. Combine flour, sugar, and mustard in a small saucepan; stir in
  vinegar until smooth. Gradually add 1 cup reserved cooking liquid,
  stirring with a whisk until blended. Bring to a boil over medium-high
  heat. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, 10 minutes. Remove from heat;
  add horseradish and margarine, and stir until blended. Serve

  Note: Even though this recipe has 40% calories from fat, a single
  serving has only 18.5 grams of fat. Add some New England brown bread
  and the calories from fat should amount to less than 30%.

  cranberry-orange salad, brown bread, and apple juice.

      Title: NEW ENGLAND CLAM CHOWDER II
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 qt Clams
      2 ea Medium onions, sliced thin
      1 c  Clam juice
      1 qt Light cream or half and half
      1 x  Butter
      1 x  Seasoning to taste
    1/2 lb Salt pork, cut fine
     10 ea Medium sized potatoes, diced
      1 qt Milk
      1 x  Flour
      1 x  Hot water
 
  Directions:  Cook clams until just opened.  Strain and reserve 1 cup
  of broth. Finely chop clams. Fry salt pork in large Dutch oven.
  Remove salt pork and add onion; brown, being careful not to let it
  scorch. Add potatoes and enough hot water to cover.  When potatoes
  are done, add clams, cook for 3 minutes over low heat. Slowly add
  milk and cream. Simmer for at about an hour being careful not to let
  it curdle.  Add thickening made of flour and butter, season and
  simmer slowly for an other hour. DO NOT LET IT BOIL. Serve hot.
  Notes: My grandfather even had this recipe printed in the New Bedford
  newspaper years ago.  If done right it doesn't curdle and is rich &
  creamy.  He used to use cream .. but we started using a combination
  of milk & cream ... it's just as tasty. One other "trick" my
  grandmother started doing was using some instant potato flakes as a
  thickener in place of some of the flour.  Tastes better and works as
  well. Lastly ... if you like you can add the salt pork back into the
  chowder after adding the milk. It is very important that you keep
  watch over the chowder so as to prevent it from boiling as this will
  cause the milk/cream to curdle. If it curdles it just won't taste
  right. You can put in any seasonings you like ... but keep it subtle
  ... you want

      1 ts Salt (more or less
           -to taste)
           Pepper
      3 ts Chili powder (or less,
           -to taste)
      1 tb Flour
      4 oz Tomato sauce
      8 oz Water
      2    Corn tortillas
      2    Eggs
           Vegetable oil
      1 c  Lettuce, shredded
      1 lg Tomato, chopped
      1 md Onion, chopped
      5 oz Cheddar cheese, grated
 
  Saute the beef over medium heat until it has lost its raw red color,
  chopping it with the edge of a spoon into small pieces as it cooks.
  Add the garlic and spices and cook another 3-4 minutes. Add salt,
  pepper and chili powder to taste. Remember that the flavor of chili
  mellows as it cooks, although it won't get less hot. Add the flour to
  the meat mixture and stir well. Add the tomato sauce and water.
  Simmer gently (uncovered) for about 45 minutes, until it has
  thickened and the flavors are blended.
  
  Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat,
  until it sizzles when a bit of tortilla is dropped in. Soften the
  tortillas briefly in the oil, one at a time, about 5 seconds on a
  side. (Turn with tongs, being careful not to tear them.) Drain on
  paper towels. Prepare another small skillet with a small amount of
  oil in the bottom, enough for frying an egg.
  
  Assembling the enchiladas requires you to keep track of several
  things at once.  Start an egg frying for each enchilada. Make sure
  that the yolk is cooked soft, not hard! Put one tortilla on a dinner
  plate. Cover it with a medium-thick layer of meat sauce. Sprinkle
  chopped onion and grated cheese on top. Sprinkle lettuce and chopped
  tomato around the edge. Top with another tortilla. Cover with more
  meat sauce, sprinkle more onion and cheese.  Now top with the fried
  egg and serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  New-Mexico-style enchiladas with eggs -- This is the way my
  grandmother and aunt made enchiladas; I haven't lived in New Mexico
  myself, but that's where this recipe came from. Yield: Serves 2.
  
  *  You can also make single-decker enchiladas, for people with small
  appetites.  Omit the second layer of tortilla, meat, onion and
  cheese, but don't forget the egg. If you make single-deckers, you
  will need twice as many tortillas and twice as many eggs, but the
  same amount of the other ingredients.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 45 minutes simmering, 5 minutes
  assembly. : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

    1/2 ts Baking powder
      1    Egg
      1 c  Milk
 
  	Roast and peel the green chile peppers, removing the seeds and
  stems. Try to keep the chile flesh whole. Make a slit in the chile
  just large enough to insert strips of cheese.
  
  	(Some cooks prefer to leave stems on(I am one), so slit down the
  side of the chile to remove seeds and to insert cheese.) 	Mix flour,
  salt and baking powder. Add molk and egg and beat until smooth. Dip
  cheese-stuffed chiles in batter and fry in about 1 inch of hot fat
  (veg oil) until they are golden brown. Drain. Ideally, they are
  served with hot pinto beans.

      1 lb Lard
           Pork broth from above
     48    Corn husks(dried)

  Assembling the Tamales: Rinse corn husks and soak in warm water until
  pliable.  Spread the center portion of each husk with 2 tb of the masa
  mixture. Top with the chile meat filling. Varied amounts of either
  the masa or thee filling may be used (some like them thin, some like
  more of the filling).  Fold the sides of the hushs toward the center,
  the bottom of the husk up the top down. Tie each tamale top and
  bottom with a narrow corn husk strip.
  
  Pour 2 inches of water in a large kettle and arrange the tamales on a

  Cut eight 1-inch slices diagonally from a loaf of day-old French (not
  Italian) bread with a serrated knife and reserve the remaining bread
  for another use. Arrange the slices on a baking sheet and let them
  stand in a warm dry place, turning them several times, for 12 hours,
  or until they are completely dry.
  
  In a bowl beat 4 large eggs with 3 Tbsp. sugar and a pinch of salt;
  add well combined. Transfer the bread slices to a baking dish just
  large enough to hold them in one layer; add the egg mixture, and let
  the slices soak, turning them carefully once or twice, for 30 to 45
  minutes, or until they are soft and have absorbed most of the liquid.
  
  Heat a large griddle over moderately high heat until it is hot and
  brush it with melted unsalted butter. Transfer bread slices with a
  slotted spatula to the griddle in batches and cook them, turning them
  once and brushing the griddle as necessary with melted unsalted
  butter, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until they are golden brown and
  slightly puffed. Transfer the toast as it is cooked to an oven-proof
  platter and keep it warm in a preheated very slow oven (150 F). Spoon

      1 ea Dill cream dressing recipe
      5 ea Green onions; finely choppe
      1 x  Salt & pepper to taste
 
  A local restaurant serves a simple, but elegant, potato salad as part
  of their Sunday Brunch menu. This is my own attempt at duplicating
  it. Stir the chopped green onions into the Dill Cream Dressing. Add
  salt and pepper to taste.  You may also want to add more lemon juice
  or Dijon mustard at this point, as this produces a fairly bland
  dressing. Slice potatoes (leave skins on) about 1/4 inch thick. Place
  in a large bowl and fold in the dressing.  Serve chilled. Best made
  the day before so the flavors have a chance to mingle. Source:

 Categories: Potatoes, Main dish
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      8 oz New potatoes; (small,
           - tender-skinned)
           - Boiling water to cover
      2 ts Mayonnaise or slaw dressing
      3    Or 4 handfuls of fresh
           - spinach leaves; coarse
           - stems removed
      4    Green onions; sliced
           - with tops
      4    Eggs
      2 ts To 3 ts Dijonnaise,
           - (or 1 part
           - mayo mixed with 2 parts
           - Dijon mustard)
           Salt to taste
      6 oz Monterey Jack cheese;
           - shredded
 
  Boil potatoes until tender.  Rinse saucepan and return to moderate
  heat; add 2 teaspoons mayonnaise or bottled slaw dressing to melt in
  pan. Meanwhile, rinse spinach and tear each leaf into three or four
  pieces. With a bit of water clinging to the spinach leaves, add to
  mayo in saucepan. Cook uncovered, along with the green onions, until
  barely wilted. Stir often. Break the eggs over the spinach-onion
  mixture and stir slightly to scramble as the eggs set.
  
  To serve, use a fork to break open each hot potato and mash to form a
  solid 'bed' on each plate.  Salt potato layer lightly and dot with
  Dijonnaise; spread to distribute evenly. Sprinkle with a little
  shredded Monterey Jack. Top with scrambled spinach-egg-onion mixture
  in an even layer. Salt lightly, if desired. Sprinkle remaining
  shredded cheese on top. Serve hot.
  
  NUTRITION ANALYSIS: 1 serving has 638 calories, 31.4 g fat, 508 mg
  cholesterol. To reduce fat and cholesterol, use egg substitute
  instead of whole eggs; buy a skim-milk mozzarella instead of Monterey
  Jack cheese, and use less in the topping. If sodium is a concern,
  this is still tasty without any table salt.

 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1 lb Small new potatoes
      1 sm Handful of sorrel
      2 oz Italian salami (or more)
           -- thinly sliced
      1 sm Onion
           Coriander seed
           Wholegrain mustard
           Olive oil
           White wine vinegar
 
  Chop the onion roughly and partially soften it in 2 generous
  tablespoons of the oil.  Do not let it brown. Scrub the potatoes (but
  on no account peel them) and steam them. Wash and dry the sorrel,
  discarding tough stalks. Roll up the leaves tighly in your fingers,
  just a few at a time, as though making a cigarette, and snip across
  into fine ribbons.
  
      Tip the softened onion and its juices into a big bowl. Stir in 1/2
  teaspoon each vinegar and mustard, some salt and lots of pepper and
  coriander seed.  The coriander seed should be freshly toasted and
  ground coarsely using a pestle and mortar or a spare peppermil. Add
  the potatoes to the bowl while still piping hot, so they drink up the
  flavours of the dressing.  Cut each potato in half or into quarters
  depending on size, and toss gently.  Scatter some of the sorrel over
  the base of a shallow serving dish. Pile the potatoes into the
  centre, encircle them with the sliced salami and scatter the
  remaining ribbons of sorrel over the top. Serve while potatoes are
  still warm.

  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Butter a 1 1/2-quart souffle dish.
  Cook the corn in the husk for 2 minutes on high in a microwave oven.
  Cool a minute or two, then remove the husk. Alternately, place the
  shucked corn in a large quantity of boiling water until done, about 5
  minutes. Using a sharp knife, cut the corn off the cob, then scrape
  down the cob with the back of the knife to get the "milk" out.
  Combine the corn, milk, cottage cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, Cheddar
  cheese, eggs, onion, chile peppers, cornmeal mix, and cilantro.
  Season to taste with salt and pepper. The pudding can be refrigerated
  for 4 hours at this point.
  
  Pour the mixture into the prepared souffle dish. Place a damp kitchen
  towel in a baking pan. Place the souffle dish on the towel and add
  enough hot water to the pan to reach two-thirds of the way up the
  sides of the dish. Bake for 1 hour or until the pudding is lightly
  browned and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean.
  Serve hot.
  
  Yield: 6 to 8 servings

  pour in 1-2 cups more. When beans are good and tender remove about a
  cupful of the beans and mash well with some of the bean liquid. (This
  can be done in a blender, of course.) Return mashed beans to pot,
  taste for seasoning, and serve steaming hot over freshly cooked white

  Not being quite as temporarily enhanced as some of the other members
  of the echo, I remember Kate Smith as an older buxom gal who could
  really belt out a tune and was fond of wearing her trademark
  low-hemmed, dark, long-sleeved, V-necked dresses.  I was unaware that
  in her younger days she had another persona.  She was a radio
  personality with a cooking show. I know 'cause last weekend I picked
  up a copy of her 1940 cookbook, "Kate Smith's Favorite Recipes,
  Anniversary Edition".
  
  The cover is worth framing.  It shows a very young Kate Smith in her
  signature dress wearing a French maid type apron, bent forward a bit
  at the waist and holding a wooden spoon up in her right hand. She
  looks mostly like a clean shaven Dom Deluise in drag getting ready to
  whack some unruly kid's knuckles. The sponsors of her show were
  Calumet Baking Powder and Swan's Down Cake Flour, both of which I
  believe are still going concerns. I think we should adopt Kate as the
  patron saint of the echo and distribute a .gif of the cover of this
  book with the "Cast" .gifs.
  
  Here's a number from the book that utilizes both of her sponsor's
  products.
  
  Sift flour once, measure, add baking powder and salt and sift together

  greased 9-inch layer pans in moderate oven (375F) for 20 to 25
  minutes. Spread Chocolate Cream Filling between layers and Hungarian
  Chocolate Frosting on top and sides of cake. When frosting is set,
  write the numbers from one to twelve around top of cake with white
  frosting to represent the face of a clock. Place hands of clock at
  twelve o'clock.
  
  CHOCOLATE CREAM FILLING:
  
  Add chocolate to milk and heat in double boiler.  When chocolate is
  melted, beat with rotary egg beater until blended. Combine sugar,
  flour, and salt; add gradually to chocolate mixture and cook until
  thickened, stirring occasionally.  Pour small amount of mixture over
  egg yolks, stirring vigorously; return to double boiler and cook for
  2 minutes longer, stirring constantly.  Add butter and vanilla, and
  cool.
  
  Makes 2 1/2 cups filling, or enough filling to spread between three
  9- inch layers.  Use this filling in small cup cakes. Use 1/2 recipe
  for filling 2 1/2 to
        3    dozen small cup cakes.
  
  HUNGARIAN CHOCOLATE FROSTING:
  
  Melt chocolate in double boiler.  Remove from boiling water, add
  sugar and water, and blend.  Add egg yolks, one at a time, beating
  will after each. Add butter, a tablespoon at a time, beating
  thoroughly after each amount.
  
  Makes enough frosting to cover the top of one 9-inch layer and sides
  of three 9-inch layers, or to cover the tops and sides of two 9-inch
  layers. Eat lots of this and you too can look like Kate Smith!
  Probably won't be able to sing as well though...

      Title: NEW YEAR'S SESAME SEED BALLS
 Categories: China, Update
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Water-ground glutinous rice
           -flour
  1 1/4 c  Light brown or white sugar
  1 1/4 c  Boiling water, approx.
      1 c  Red Bean Paste
    1/4 c  White sesame seeds
      6 c  Oil for deep frying
 
  Put rice flour in large mixing bowl.  Dissolve brown sugar in boiling
  water; then stir sugar water into flour until flour is all damp. Add
  more hot water if flour appears too dry. Pat and knead dough in bowl
  until soft and smooth. Break off half the dough and roll it a little
  between your palms; if it isn't smooth, wet your hands and roll it
  again. Then break it into fifteen pieces. Roll each piece between
  your palms into a ball about the size of a walnut. Cover with damp
  towel or plastic wrap. Take a ball of dough and press an indentation
  into it, making a deep cup. Place 1 teaspoon filling inside and close
  the cup, making sure you completely cover the filling with the dough.
  Pince and twist off a pice of dough and seal the edge well.  Roll the
  filled ball between your palms to make it perfectly round.  Then roll
  the ball in sesame seeds, pressing gently, until the entire surface
  is covered and the seeds adhere to the dough. Prepare the other half
  of the dough and cover the finished balls with a damp towel or
  plastic wrap. Heat wok over medium heat. Add oil and heat to 350
  degrees. Lower ina few balls at a time and let cook slighly. When
  sesame seeds turn ligh brown, apply some pressure to the balls with
  the back of a large ladle, pressing them against the bottom or side
  of the pan. Do this continuously, pressing each ball until it blows
  up to about three times its original size and the sesame seeds turn
  golden brown; this takes about 5 minutes.Each time you press down on
  a ball with the back of a large ladle, it will automatically turn
  over and expand a little. The trick is to work all the balls in
  separate turns, until they have tripled in size, pressing each one
  separately and quickly going on to the next during the 5 minute
  process. Drain the sesame balls on paper towels and serve them warm
  or at room temperature. Already cooked sesame balls can be reheated
  in a preheated 450 degree oven for about 5 minutes, or until they
  puff up again. New Year's Sesame Seed Balls

  The tomatoes and thyme along with lots of clams are what makes it

  Dust the chicken in the flour  and set aside. Make the batter by
  beating eggs briskly, then beating in the lemon juice, parsley, salt,
  wine, garlic, hot pepper sauce, and Parmesan. Coat a heavy skillet
  with margarine or oliveoil and place over high heat. Dip the floured

  Remove chicken from the pan and drain excess oil. Make the wine sauce
  by melting the margarine in the pan, then stirring in the wine and
  lemon juice. Return the chicken pieces to the pan, spooning the wine
  sauce over all and cook 1 minute longer. Serve immediately.

      Title: NEW YORK STYLE PIZZA DOUGH
 Categories: Pizza
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ts Active dry yeast
      3 c  Bread flour
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  Recipe by: Evelyne Slomon - The Pizza Book 1. Pour the water into a
  medium-sized mixing bowl and sprinkle in
    the yeast.  Stir gently with a fork until the yeast has dissolved.
  2. Add 1 cup of flour and the salt. Mix thoroughly with a wooden
    spoon.  Add a second cup of flour and mix well. After the second
    cup of flour has been mixed in, the dough will start coming away
    from the sides of the bowl and should begin to form a soft,
    sticky mass.  It is now ready to be kneaded. 3. Measure out the
  third cup of flour.  Sprinkle some over the work
    surface and flour your hands generously.  Remove all of the dough
    from the bowl and begin to work the mass by kneading the
    additional flour in a bit at a time. 4. Knead the dough until it no
  longer feels sticky. Continue
    kneading only until the dough is smooth and elastic and no lines of
    raw white flour show.  The whole process should take 5 to 10
  minutes. 5. Lightly oil a 2-quart bowl with vegetable oil. Roll the
  ball of
    dough around in the bowl to coat it with a thin film of oil. Tightly
    seal the bowl with plastic wrap.  Place the bowl in a warm
  draft-free
    place. 6. When the dough has doubled in bulk (45 to 60 minutes),
  punch it
    down, knead it for 2 to 3 minutes.  Then return it to the bowl
    and refrigerate for 15 minutes before shaping. 7. The dough should
  never be rolled out with a rolling pin. This
    crushes the edges and affects the final texture. The stretching
    method is the only suitable way to shape the dough.
