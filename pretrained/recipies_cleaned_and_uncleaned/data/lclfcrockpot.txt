"Slightly" Italian Chicken - Pjxg05a

poultry, crockpot, low cal

1  judy garnett
1  pam; or other veg. spray
4  lg boneless chicken breasts
1  (remove all skin)
1  can mushroom pieces; drained
1  can artichoke hearts; drain
1  bunch green onions; chopped
      ----SAUCE----
1 tablespoon qk-cooking tapioca; (heaping
2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice; *
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1  env. low-sod. ckn bouillon
1/3 cup low-cal italian salad dsg.
1/2 cup white wine
1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce; **

Spray crock inside with Vegetable Spray. Place drained mushrooms, drained
artichoke hearts and chopped green onions in bottom of crockpot. Sprinkle
vegetables with a heaping Tablespoon of quick-cooking tapioca and 1
envelope of chicken bouillon (I use MBT brand of low-sodium chicken
bouillon, but any will do). If you're using granulated bouillon, use about
a heaping teaspoon. Place well-washed and dried boneless chicken breasts
(all skin and fat removed). Combine remaining sauce ingredients and pour on
top of chicken and vegetables. Cover and set crockpot on High. Cook 5-6
hours or until tender. The tapioca thickens the sauce while it cooks (you
can't even guess the tapioca is in there later). Hope you enjoy. Judy
Garnett pjxg05a * I used Minute Maid fresh frozen lemon juice because I
don't like the taste of Real-Lemon and I didn't have a fresh lemon on hand.
** I use Angostura brand low-sodium worcestershire

Crockpot Beans & Barley

crockpot, low fat, misc

1  onion, chopped
1  carrot, chopped (i used 2, i
1  like them)
1 cup navy beans, soaked
1/2 teaspoon prepared mustard
1/2 cup split peas, dried
1/4 cup pearl barley
1/2 cup mushrooms, chopped
1 cup pinto beans, uncooked
4 cup vegetable broth
3 tablespoon parsley, minced
1/4 cup lentils, dried

Soak white and pinto beans overnight. Saute onion, mushrooms and
carrot in 1 T of vegetable broth until tender. Add drained beans,
vegetable bouillon, mustard and parsley, bring to bil. Reduce heat,
cover and simmer 45 minutes. Add split peas, lentils and barley.
Cover and simmer another hour until all beans are tender. (Note: I
like it spicy so I added lots of tabasco and pepper). I know this is
more of a "winter recipe" but I think it will be good cold, also.
Things got a bit mushy in the crockpot so it might be better to cook
on the stove.

Crockpot Beans & Grains

low fat, grains

1 cup dried beans, soaked
1  overnight and drained
1 cup slow-cooking grains (i use
1  half wheat berries and half
1  rye berries)
1  onion, chopped
2  cloves garlic, chopped
28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, or
15 oz can plus
1  canful water
1  generous pinches of herbs
1  (this time it was thyme and
1  rosemary, usually it is
1  basil and oregano)
1  generous sprinkling of black
1  pepper

And the recipe, for a bean and grain dish that I am having for lunch
along with leftover salad.  This is a dish I often cook when I am
going to be getting home too late to cook, since I make it in a
crockpot and it is ready to eat when I get home.

Cook on low for 10-12 hours, and serve.  It seems like a very small
amount of liquid, but I've found that everything in the crockpot
retains more liquid than when cooked on the stove, and the beans have
already absorbed a lot in the soaking.  If you like your beans soupy
(or want to use it as a soup), add more.  If you don't mind
very-cooked vegetables, or are around to add vegetables an hour or
two before serving, chop up some carrots and celery and add.  I find
that the canned tomatoes have quite enough salt for my taste.

Please note: The original recipe for this calls for green peppers. Since my

also put in fresh minced ginger instead of powdered which the original
recipe calls for. *Remove all skin and any fat from chicken before cooking.
** DO NOT DRAIN the pineapple, include the juice in the crockpot.***Mince
the ginger if using fresh ginger. For crockpot cooking -Put vegs. in bottom
of crockpot. Sprinkle tapioca over vegetables. Place chicken atop
vegetables. Combine all other ingreds. except rice in a small bowl. Pour
over chicken. Cover crockpot and turn to low and cook for 8-10 hours.
Before serving make rice. Serve over rice. Leftovers can be reheated in
microwave. To cook in oven: Put vegetables in bottom of a greased pan.

Diet Cream Soup Base

soups, crockpot, diabetic, low-fat/cal, allergy

1  white sauce
3 1/2 tablespoon instant milk powder
1 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
1 1/4 cup cold water
1  tomato
8 oz can tomato sauce
3 tablespoon chopped onion
1 pinch dry rosemary, crumbled
1 pinch fresh ground pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper

This recipe is suitable for anyone who needs to know the exact contents of
soup. OTHER OPTIONS: Regular recipes use about 1 1/2 Tb butter and 1 1/2 Tb
flour per cup of milk for a medium white sauce.

5 oz evaporated milk plus 5 oz water plus 1 Tb corn starch

1 cup soy milk plus 1 Tb corn starch

1 cup skim milk plus 1 Tb vegetable oil plus 1 Tb corn starch

Put ingredients in a blender and process at high speed until well blended,
or put ingredients in a jar and shake, or stir dry ingredients into cold
milk with a whisk.

Stir constantly in the top of a double boiler until the sauce thickens and
simmers, then cook ten minutes.  A medium saucepan set in a larger saucepan
of simmering water works, too.

Fresh tomatoes may be cooked with onion and seasoning, allowed to cool and
pureed in a blender to make the sauce.  If the tomato mixture is colder,
add a little of the hot white sauce to bring it to the same temperature.
This prevents curdling when the red mixture is gradually added back into
the pot with the white sauce.

Heat soup until it is hot enough to serve but do not allow it to boil.

The same method may be used with 3/4 to 1 cup of cooked diced (or pureed)
vegetables with cooking liquid used to make the sauce.  Makes about 2 cups.
Suggested vegetables:  potato with a little onion, carrot, zucchini,
cabbage with a little ham, sauteed onion, mushroom, broccoli. Season to
taste.

Tested Dec 93 using powdered milk, and (thawed) canned tomato by Elizabeth
Rodier.  This was a successful experiment based on a combination of recipes
from several different books.

yams, carrot, celery, and leek.  Cook for 30 minutes.  Add remaining

individual bowls or over any whole grain. Also good as a topping for
