           Salt and freshly ground        
 
     FOR CREPES:  Put cold water, milk, egg, egg whites and salt into
  blender; add flour, then oil.  Blend at top speed, stopping to scrape flour
  from the sides.
     Cover and refrigerate 2 hours.  (This is an important step; it allows
  the flour particles to expand in the liquid and ensures a tender, thin
  crepe. The batter should have a very light, creamy texture - just thick
  enough to coat a wooden spoon.)
     For each crepe, heat a 6-inch nonstick frying pan over moderately high
  heat.  When hot, pour a scant 1/4 cup of the batter into the skillet;
  immediately rotate pan until batter covers bottom. Cook until light brown;
  turn and brown the other side.  Slide onto a warm plate and proceed in the
  same manner with the rest of the batter.
     Put waxed paper between the crepes as you stack them. Keep crepes
  covered to prevent them from drying out. They are now ready to be filled.
  Makes 20 - 6 inch crepes. 1 crepe = 1 servng.

      Title: Gelatin Chilling Time Chart and Hints
 Categories: Desserts, Jell-o, Diabetic
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           ****** Chilling Chart ******   
 
     In all recipes, for best results, the gelatin needs to be chilled to the
  proper consistency.  Use this chart as a guideline to determine the desired
  consistency and the approximate chilling times for a 4-serving package.
  
  When recipe      It means gelatin       It will take about:    Use it says:
  should ...             Reg. set   Speed set*   for:
  ==========================================================================

  "chill until     be thick enough        1 1/2       7 to 8     adding

  "chill until     stick to the finger     2          indiv.     layered set

                   when mold is            at least 4 hours
                   tilted                  8-12 cup mold:
                                           at least 5 hours or
                                           overnight
  ==========================================================================
     *Speed set (ice cube method) not recommended for molding because pieces
  of unmelted ice may result in pockets of water
  
                                  HINTS
     Substitute COLD carbonated beverages, such as club soda, fruit flavored
  sparkling water, or diet carbonated soft drinks, for part or all of the
  cold water.
     Do not use frexh or frozen pineapple, kiwi, papaya, figs or guava; an
  enzyme in these fruits will prevent the gelatin from setting.  The fruits
  are fine, however, if cooked or canned, because these processes inactivate
  the enzyme. (You may also use these fruits as a garnish without a problem.
     To easily combine whipped topping, yogurt, sour cream or mayonnaise with
  gelatin, use a wire whisk or fork.
     To speed chilling time, choose the right container.  Metal bowls or
  mokds chill more quickly than glass or plastic bowls so your gelatin will
  be firm in less time.  Individual servings in small dishes chill faster
  than large servings.
     To determine the volume of your mold, measure first with water.  Most
  recipes indicate the size of the mold needed.  Using a mold that is too
  large makes unmolding difficult.
     If using a mold for summer salads or desserts, remember any "mold" can
  do -- traditional molds, plus many untraditional ones, like loaf pans, cake
  pans, fluted tube pans or metal mixing bowls.
     Spray the mold lightly with non-stick cooking spray to make the gelatin
  easier to unmold.
     Before unmolding, make sure gelatin is completely firm.  (It should not
  feel sticky or move to the side if tilted.)
     To unmold, use a small metal spatula dipped in warm water to loosen top
  edge.  Dip mold in warm, not hot, water, just to the rim, for about 10
  seconds.  Lift from water, hold upright and shake to loosen gelatin.
     Use a bowl instead of a mold for many of these recipes; it makes serving
  easier, family-style.  Or pour mixture into individual dishes for meals
  when the family is on different schedules.
     Keep nutritious snacks (any of these recipes that combine gelatin with
  vegetables, fruits or lowfat dairy products) on hand in individual serving
  cups or plastic containers for kids or dieters.  Foil baking cups set into
  muffin pans work well, too, and are easy to store in the refrigerator.
     If making salads for a party, double the recipe, except for flavoring
  ingredients like salt, vinegar and lemon juice; use just 1 1/2 times these
  ingredients.
     Carry gelatin molds to parties in the molds themselves, then unmold onto
  chilled plate.  Or chill in attractive bowl and serve from it.

     NOTE:  You must be very true to pan size in this recipe. I only had a
  9-inch springform pan and the single package of ladyfingers was not
  adequate.  I also did not measure the Cool Whip Lite and so my end product
  was slightly softer than I expected, altho' not too bad. All in all, this
  is a delicious dessert, one well worth the effort be it for yourself or for
  company.  (Trish)

     NOTE:  You could probably cut the fat amount by 1/3 by using a light
  cream cheese product, Neufchatel cheese. Also, I would substitute fresh
  fruit for the pie filling or possibly use a can of water packed fruit and
  thicken the juice with cornstarch.  This would probably lower the
  carbohydrate count. (Trish)

     Combine sugar and cinnamon.  Spray tortillas with non-stick cooking
  spray.  Sprinkle each tortilla with a scant 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon-sugar
  mixture.  Turn tortillas over; repeat. Cut each tortilla into 4 wedges.
  Stand rounded edges (outside edge) of each tortilla wedge in bottom of
  muffin cup, curling sides in to fit cup. Bake 10 minutes or until crisp and
  lightly browned.  Cool in pan.  (Note: when you have the tortillas in the
  muffin cups, the point will be standing up above the pan.)
     Pour milk into large mixing bowl.  Add pudding mix. Beat at low speed
  with electric mixer until well blended, 1 to 2 minutes. Beat in cream
  cheese product at medium speed until smooth. Gently stir in whipped
  topping.  Refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour.
     When ready to serve, fill each tortilla shell with a scant 3 Tablespoons
  pudding mixture, using a pastry bag or spoon. Place chocolate in small
  freezer-weight zippered plastic bag. Microwave on HIGH 1 minute or until
  chocolate is melted.  Fold over top of bag tightly; snip off one tiny

  drizzle chocolate over desserts.  Refrigerate until chocolate sets, about 5
  minutes.  Makes 20 servings.

    1/4 c  Diet margarine-1/2 stick                 PERSONAL NOTES from Ursula

      1 ts Vanilla                                  **Use Grape-Nuts instead of
      1 pk 8 oz. reduced cream cheese;              -nuts - they have no fat

    1/2 c  Chopped nuts; optional**       
 
  Melt margarine over low heat.  Add chocolate and stir until melted. Remove
  from heat and stir in sweetner and vanilla. Combine chocolate mixture with
  the cream cheese and beat until smooth. Stir in nuts - if used. Spread in
  lightly 8 greased square pan. Refrigerate until firm and keep in frig. This
  is great and you don't even notice the cream cheese even if you don't like
  cream cheese.  You can add more Equal if you like it a little sweeter since
  some chocolate is a little more bitter than others. This was posted on *P

    We used a pear to sweeten the strong flavor of turnips, then added some
  roasted garlic for a robust alternative to mashed potatoes.
    Steam turnips over boiling water until fork tender, about 15 minutes.
  Drain turnips and place in a food processor or blender along with pear,
  garlic, and margarine. Process until smooth, adding skim milk as needed.
  Season with salt and pepper.

 Categories: Potatoes, Diabetic, Low-cal/fat, Vegetables, Side dish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
-------------------------FORMATTED BY JOYCE BURTON-------------------------
      4    Potatoes; medium to small           4 sl Bacon
      4    Carrots; medium to large            1 lg Onion
 
  Peel and cut up potatoes and carrots.  Add to boiling water. Use enough
  water to cover.  Cook until soft enough to mash. While they cook, chop
  onion and cut slices of bacon into 1/2-inch squares. Fry bacon in frying
  pan until half done, then add the onion and cook both until the bacon is
  crisp and the onion is transparent.
  
  Drain onion and bacon on paper towels or in a colander. If you wish to save
  bacon grease for other cooking, place colander over a bowl to collect
  drippings.  Mash the potatoes and carrots.  If the carrots are not quite
  done, this make an interesting texture. Add the drained bacon and onion
  bits and mix well.
  
  Makes 6 servings of 1/3 cup each.  You may wish to allow larger portions
  for the rest of the family.

    This is a useful side dish to have on a cold wintry night when tomatoes
  are not at their best.  The slow roasting at very low heat greatly improves
  their flavor; by the end of the baking rime they are almost caramelized.
    For an easy pasta sauce, double the recipe and process in a food
  processor or blender.
    Preheat oven to 300F (150C).  Insert a whole garlic clove in the stem end
  of each tomato.  Place tomatoes stem end down on a small baking sheet
  lightly sprayed with cooking spray. Spray tomatoes as well; sprinkle with
  salt and pepper.  Bake for 2 hours, until tomatoes begin to caramelize.
  Remove from oven and transfer tomatoes to serving plates. Sprinkle with
  fresh basil or parsley.

    Once you;ve tasted what this intensely flavored vinegar from Modena,

  balsamic vinegar.  (this was the paragraph just above the recipe...Ursula)

    PERSONAL NOTE from Ursula Taylor - folks I see no reason why after making
  and cooling slightly - instead of spooning into six dessert dishes that you
  could not then pour into an already baked pie shell and then top with the
  remaining coconut.  Then just adjust exchanges, calories and carbohydrates
  to reflect the addition of the pie crust.

    Break egg into small mixing bowl and beat slightly. Add remaining

    Almost every French bistro serves a version of this homey dish. Our
  recipe uses balsamic vinegar and fresh rosemary for a wonderfully simple
  and slightly Italian variation. Serve with steamed or boiled potatoes and a
  salad of baby lettuce.
    Remove all visible fat from chicken.  Spray a large nonstick skillet with
  cooking spray.  Brown chicken breasts over medium-high heat for 3 minutes
  per side. Transfer chicken to a plate. Add onion, garlic, and mushrooms to
  same skillet.  Reduce heat to low and saute until onion is translucent but
  not browned, about 3 minutes. Add vinegar, wine, pepper, salt, and
  rosemary.  Bring mixture to a simmer.  Return chicken pieces to skillet.
  Cover and simmer until chicken breasts are cooked through, about 20
  minutes.
    Transfer chicken to a heated serving platter.  Cook sauce over high heat
  until reduced to about 1/2 cup. Remove from heat and whisk in butter. Pour
  sauce over chicken; garnish with rosemary sprigs.
    Makes 4 servings.

  cream cheese.  You can add more Equal if you like it a little sweeter since
  some chocolate is a little more bitter than others. This was posted on *P

      Title: Meal-In-A-Bowl Potato Salad
 Categories: Diabetic, Salads, Vegetables, Main dish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
-----------------------------------SALAD-----------------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Small red new potatoes            1/2 sm Red onion; thinly sliced and
           -unpeeled                                -separated into rings
      1    Green pepper; seeded and          1/2 c  Pitted ripe black olives
           -sliced crosswise into rings             -sliced in half crosswise
      4    Hard-boiled eggs                  1/4 c  Parsley; minced

----------------------------------DRESSING----------------------------------
  1 1/4 c  Plain low-fat yogurt            1 1/2 ts Dijon mustard
      3 tb Fresh; dill snipped               1/2 ts Sugar
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice                 1/4 ts Salt; optional
      1 tb Lemon juice                       1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1 tb Olive oil                      
 
  Steam the unpeeled potatoes until they are just tender when pierced with a
  fork, but not mushy.  If they are very small, leave them whole, or, when
  cool enough to handle, cut them in half or quarters with a very sharp
  knife, taking care not to pull off the skin. Place them in a large bowl, or
  on a serving platter surrounded by the green pepper rings.
  
  Slice the eggs crosswise, but remove and discard two of the yolks. Arrange
  the slices over the potatoes.  Add the onion rings and olives, and sprinkle
  the salad with the parsley.  In a small bowl, combine the dressing
  ingredients.  Pour the dressing over the salad. Either serve the salad as
  is, or toss it gently.  The salad may be served at room temperature or
  chilled.  Source:  Jane Brody's Good Food Book.

      2 sm Black olives; rinsed,          
 
  *Anne's note: The nutritional analysis omit the anchovies; they would
  substantinally increase the sodium in the recipe
  
  "Pan Bagnat is the name for this stuffed sandwich in Monaco and in France
  (where the name is hyphenated). The fillings can vary. For example,
  Bordeaux-born Celine Beteta Wong, who works in the office of the Consulate
  in New York, says she also fills her Pan Bagnat with tuna. It can be a
  complete meal - great for a picnic or bag lunch. This recipe is from the
  late Princess Grace of Monaco, who graciously shared it with me many years
  ago."
  
  1. Slice the roll in half horizontially. Remove part of the bread to allow
  space for the filling. 2. Divide all the filling evenly among the 4 rools.
  Begin by drizzling the bottom of the rolls with a little oil. Drop some
  onion, bell pepper, tomato, egg, anchovy (if you are using it) and olives
  into each roll bottom (the filling maounts are personal choices). 3. Season
  to your taste with viengar. Cover the roll with the top half. Serve cold.

      Title: Dessert Not Dirty Word Now
 Categories: Diabetic, Info/help
      Yield: 1 info/help
 
      1    Info/help                      
 
      Sweet desserts for diabetics?  It's not joke.
  
      The latest guidelines say that people with diabetes do not have to
  avoid simple sugars.  They can be integrated into individualized meal
  plans.
  
      However, sucrose and sugary foods need to be exchanged with other foods
  and simply added to a meal plan, say Ann Gallagher, a registered dietitian
  and a member of the board of directors of the American Diabetes
  Association.
  
      In diabetes, a disease that affects 14 million Americans, the body does
  not produce or properly respond to insulin, a necessary hormone. If not
  controlled by diet and/or insulin injections, this results in high blood
  sugar, which can lead to blindness, kidney disease, heart disease and
  amputations.
  
      Diabetes is the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States.
  
      For most of the century, it was widely believed that the dietary
  treatment of diabetes required a person to replace simple sugars with
  complex starches such as potatoes or cereals, Gallagher says.  Many people
  still think that eating too much sugar causes diabetes, she says. But the
  most common form of diabetes call adult-onset  -- most ofter results from
  being overweight.
  
      There is little scientific evidence that sugars - such as sucrose,
  fructose, corn sweeteners, fruit juices, honey, molasses, destrose and
  maltose - aggravate high blood sugar any more than starches do.  It's the
  total amount of carbohydrates that affects blood sugar after a meal,
  Gallagher says.
  
      Individuals with a diabetic condition now can use monitoring and can
  customize their meal plans, often in consultation with a registered
  dietian, to include a balance of foods in line with the USDA.
  
      Those who are obese or who have high cholesterol, high blood pressure
  or other conditions must take other precautions to control those
  conditions, Gallagher says.
  
      The new diabetic guidelines replace 1986 recommendations, which advised
  that 12 percent to 20 percent of calories should come from protein, less
  that 30 percent from fat and only up to 60 percent from carbohydrates. The
  new guideline recommend that 10 percent to 20 percent of calories come from
  protein but establish no fat and carbohydrate percentages.
  
      People with normal levels of cholesterol and triglycerides and who
  maintain normal weight can follow mainstrem guidelines of not more that 30
  percent of calories from fat (10 percent or less from saturated fat)

  5: The Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook by WHOM.
     This is diabetic cookbook that has some good recipes, but I found
     it hard to put all together to enter in the Meal-Master.
  
  6: All-In-One Diabetic Cookbook by P.J. Palumbo, M.D., E.A.C.P. and
     Joyce Daly Margie, M.S.
     It appears to have some good recipes, but found a * which was used
     to refer as a high sodium recipe in the title of the recipe.  It
     does have some good recipes that sound pretty good.  The lettering
     is  small.
  
  7. All New Cookbook for Diabetics and their Families by the University
     of Alabama at Birmingham.
     This is a good cookbook and it does have good recipes.  It sure
     would be nice if there was more cookbooks which tell how to convert
     to low-sodium diet for those diabetics must maintain a low-sodium
     diet as well.
  
  8: Recipes for Diabetics by Billie Little.
     A NEW version now has larger printing. It is good for those
     that have vision problems.  It is still has the same recipes as
     my copy which has very tiny printing.  A good many cookbooks have
     now LARGE printing.

     Just a cookbook which was very cheap.  It is not one of my
     favorite ones.

      and Frances Tower Giedt.

      to be real nice at Chirstmas time...this is his deed.(GINNY GRIN)
  
  This three are for fun and information.  One is called Vegetarian Cooking
  for Diabetics by Patricia Mozzer.  It has some helpful information if your
  fellow a vegetarian diet.  I did find some good sandwiches recipes in it.
  Desserts for Diabetics by Mabel Cavaiani, R. D. Has some very good recipes
  for the diabetic human.
  
  Last but now least my very favorite fun diabitic cookbook is called "THE

           -Sugar free                              Cool-Whip Lite;
 
  Takes up to two days to prepare properly Break angel cake in medium size
  pieces, spread each with small amount of Raspberry Jam, arrange in straight
  sided glass bowl.  Pour over the sherry and weight down lightly with saucer
  and cover with plastic wrap, set aside for a few hours. After sherry has
  been absorbed, mix Jello according to directions, do not use ice. Pour over
  cake and sherry in the bowl. Cover and place in refrigerator for several
  hours or overnight until jello is set. Before serving, prepare Vanilla
  Pudding mix and pour over top of jello, using a knife to slide down sides
  of bowl to allow some of the pudding to go down sides. Cover and chill
  again. Garnish with cherries and mint, or use some of the candied holiday
  fruits to decorate top of bowl. When serving, be sure to slide spoon to the
  bottom of the bowl for each serving, not only for the colors of the
  different layers, but to be sure each serving gets the flavor of the
  sherry. Top with a small dollop of Cool Whip Lite.
  
  If you're not watching sugar content or calories, the same recipe can be
  made with regular jam, regular jello and regular pudding mix. Looks best in
  a straight sided glass bowl. This has been a family favorite for Christmas
  since my childhood.

  vanilla ice cream if desired.

  When alcohol is used in a recipe, it is generally used for one of two
  reasons; as a flavor enhancer in cooking, or as a meat tenderizer in
  marinades.  A variety of other foods do have the same properties as alcohol
  in cooking and marinating and can be easily substituted in any recipe. Here
  are a few suggestions:
  
  MARINADES:
  
  Substitute for 1 cup of alcohol with:
  
  1 cup of citrus juice, Lemonade, Pineapple or Orange  Juice.
  
  1/2 cup of fresh lemon juice or orange juice.
  
  1 cup of tomato juice diluted by 1/4 with water or vinegar.
  
  1/2 cup of light soy sauce and 1/2 cup of citrus juice.
  
  1/2 cup of light soy sauce and 2 TBLS of oil.
  
  1 cup of teriyaki sauce
  
  1/3 cup of balsamic vinegar
  
  FOR COOKING:
  
  Non-alcoholic cooking sherry
  
  Non-alcoholic cooking wine
  
  Raspberry extract (instead of Brandy)
  
  Or you can burn the alcohol out of the liquor by heating the liquor in a
  pan and carefully lighting a match

    1/4 c  Salted cashew nuts;                 4 tb Margarine; to taste
           -Used salt free                     1 lb Asparagus; rinsed trimmed
      4 tb Butter                              2 tb Water;
           -used margarine instead        
 
  In a large saucepan cook cashew nuts in 2 tablespoon butter over maderate
  heat, stirring, for 2 minutes and transfer them with slotted spoon to paper
  towels to drain.  Add to the pan the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and
  the asparagus over high heat for 1 minute. Add 2 tablespoons water and cook
  covered for 3-4 minutes or until asparagus is tender. Transfer the
  asparagus with slotted spatula to a heated serving dish and spatula to a
  heated serving dish and spinkle with the nuts. (I wouldn't do this much
  work for any thing.  I'd steam the asparagus. I would also cook the cashew
  nuts in a non-stick pan using vegetalbe spray, if I JUST had to have them
  roasted. If I had no cashew, I would use any nuts that I have on hand.

  Add the green onions, egg and butter, whipping mixture well. Season with
  salt and cayenne.  Fold in tomato and tuna. Pile this mixture back into the
  potato skins, mounding it high (shells will be heaped up almost 3 inches
  higher). Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Place on baking pan. Bake at 400
  degrees for 10 minutes or until potatoes are heated through. Serves 4.
  
  You may cut this recipe in half, but still use one egg.

  bake.  Add 3 to 4 tbsp more milk to prevent drying and bake for about 20
  minutes if preparing ahead.  Stuffed potatoes can also be microwaved for 3
  to 4 minutes on full power. Origin: My Great Recipes See card 18.13

  Turn chicken; brush with more glaze.  Broil for 5 to 15 minutes more or
  till tender and no longer pink, brushing often with glaze during the last 5
  minutes of cooking.

      Title: Marinated Chinese Hamburgers
 Categories: Diabetic, Meats, Oriental, Main dish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     16 oz Lean ground beef                    1 tb Cornstarch
      2    Egg whites                          2 ts Finely minced garlic
     22    Scallions, finely chopped           2 ts Finely minced fresh ginger
           -green and white parts incl.             Freshly ground pepper to
      4 ts Reduced-sodium soy sauce                 -taste
 
  I used ground turkey in this recipe and next time I make it I won't use the
  egg whites.  I think it made them goopier than they needed to be. I also
  used green onions instead of scallions.  This was an interesting
  recipe--I've never had hamburgers with ginger before and it was a unique
  taste!
  
  1.  Preheat an outdoor grill or a broiler until hot (I would suggest using
  a cooking spray on the broiler pan--I had fun soaking mine!)
  
  2.  Combine the ingredients in a large mixing bowl, mix with your hands,
  and form into 4 patties.
  
  3.  Broil for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until cooked to the desired
  degree of doneness.
  
  4.  Serve hot.
  
  The cookbook suggests serving this with Oven-Fried Potatoes, Onions Baked
  in Their Skins, and Two-Lettuce Salad with Creamy Horseradish Dressing.

           -=OR=-                         
 
  Line the pan with aluminum foil and spray with a vegetable cooking spray
  since the onions release a sticky syrup while baking. Preheat the oven to
  375F.  Line a small baking pan with aluminum foil and spray with vegetable
  cooking spray. Trim off the root ends of the onions but leave the skin
  intact. Place upright in the prepared pan and bake for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or
  until very tender. Remove the skins and discard. Top each with melted
  butter or margarine, season with salt and pepper, and serve piping hot,
  garnished with parsley sprigs.

      2    Tortillas; cut in                        Salt to taste
           - quarters                          1 oz To 2 oz cheese; (low-fat)
           Cooking spray                 

----------------------------------GARNISH----------------------------------
           Onions, lettuce, tomatoes,               Jalapnos, etc.
 
  Just cut a couple of tortillas in quarters and spread on a cookie sheet.
  Bake at about 300 until their crisp.  (I like them slightly browned.)
  They're old-style, REAL tortilla chips, not the flimsy ones. If you like
  them salted, spray with a little Pam before you bake them and sprinkle with
  salt. With an ounce or two of grated cheese and LOTS of Pace's, these make
  pretty good nachos.  (Onions, lettuce, tomatoes, jalapenos, etc., are all
  good, too.)    :)

  Cook beans.  Saute onions and garlic in oil until onions are clear. Add
  mushrooms, chicken broth, lemon juice, lemon pepper, and rice to beans,
  cook over low heat for about 1/2 hour.
  
  This is complete nutrition when eaten with some green salad. Nearly no fat,

  ounce.  I soak my beans over night in soda water to eliminate gas.
  
  For variety, use beef stock, and other veggies sauteed, and other
  spices...the variety is infinite!  The taste is DELICIOUS!!!!

  sugar. Bring to a boil, then simmer, uncovered, for about 15 minutes, or
  until the liquid evaporates and the onion are tender. Stir in the vinegar,

      Title: Fruit Sweet and Sugar Free - Squaw Bread
 Categories: Diabetic, Breads/bm, Fruits
      Yield: 2 round loaf
 
  1 1/4 c  Raisin water;                       3 c  Unbleached white flour;
    1/2 c  Raisins;                            1 tb Salt;
      1 c  Lukewarm water;                     1 c  Rye flour;
      2 tb Dry baker's yeast;                  2 c  Whole wheat flour;
    1/2 c  Fruit sweetener;                  1/4 c  Cornmeal for baking pan;
    1/3 c  Oil;                                     Softened butter for garnish
 
  First plump the raisins by brining 1-1/4 cups water to a boil and adding
  1/2 cup raisins. Turn off the heat and let the raisins sit in the water for
  at least 10 minutes. Drain the raisins, reserving the raising water. Add
  only enough lukewarm water to the raisin water to make a total of 2-1/4
  cups. Put the raisins aside.
  
  To Prepare the dough by machine: ******************************** Combine
  the oil, unbleached white flour, salt, rye flour, and 2 cups of the whole
  wheat flour in the mixing bowl of your electric mixer. Stir in the
  activated yeast. Once the flour is incorporated increase the mixer spead to
  medium. Use the dough hook to knead the dough for about 10 minutes, adding
  only enough flour to form a medium stiff dough that comes off the sides and
  bottom of the bowl. Reduce the speed and gently knead in the raisins.
  
  To Prepare the dough by hand: ***************************** Combine the
  oil, unbleached flour, salt, rye flour, and 2 cupts of the whole wheat
  flour in a medium size mixing bowl.  Use a wooden spoon to stir in the
  activated yeast.  Mix all together to form a medium soft dough. Sprinkle a
  little whole wheat flour on your work surface. Knead the dough, adding
  additional flour only if necessary to keep the dough from sticking. Knead
  the dough for 15-20 minutes until to becomes smooth and quite elastic.
  
  Raising the Dough and Forming the Loaves:
  ***************************************** Place the well kneaded dough in a
  lightly oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise
  in a warm, draft free place until doubled. Remove the plastic wrap from the
  bowl, and using your fist, gently deflat the dough by punching it down.
  Knead the dough in the bowl about 10 times. Cover the bowl with plastic
  wrap and again let the dough rise until doubled in size. Punch the dough
  down again and turn out onto a very lightly floured surface. Divide the
  dough in half, Knead each half 8-10 times. Turn the dough over and, by
  placing your fingers on the bottom of the dough and your thumbs on tope,
  "cup" each half to form 2 round loaves. Place them on a cornmeal sprinkled,
  baking paper lined baking pan. Put the loaves in a draft free spot to proof
  until doubled in size.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. With a serrated knife, cut a cross on the
  top of each loaf. Bake the loaves in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes.
  When the loaves are removed from the oven, brush their tops with softened
  butter.

      1 ts Baking soda;                  

------------------------------WET INGREDIENTS------------------------------
      6 tb Fruit Sweetener;                    2    Eggs;
  1 1/3 c  Buttermilk;                    
 
  Begin by plumping the raisins. Bring 1 cup of water to a boil and add the
  raisins. When the water returns to a boil, turn off the heat. Let the
  raisins plump in the water for at least 10 minutes. Drain the raisins,
  saving any raising water for another use. Set raisins aside.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly spray a baking sheet with lecithin
  spray, or line it with baking paper. Cut the cold butter into 1/2 inch
  pieces. Sift the dry ingredients together into a medium size bowl or the
  mixing bowl for your electric mixer. With the mixer on its lowest speed,
  use the paddle attachment or your beaters to cut the cold butter into the
  dry ingredients, until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Stir in the
  plumped raisins and the caraway seeds. In a small bowl, whisk together the
  sweetener, buttermilk and eggs and add to the flour mixture. Stir together
  on medium low speed just until mixed.
  
  Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface. Divide it into 2 equal
  portions. Knead each portion 8-10 times, and form into a round loaf, 8
  inches in diameter. Place the loaves on the prepared baking pan. Use a
  serrated knife to cut a 1/2 inch deep cross on the top of each loaf. Place
  the loaves on the middle shelf in the preheated oven, and bake for 40 to 50
  minutes until golden brown and crusty.
  
  Remove the loaves to a wire rack to cool. Irish Soda Bread is wonderful
  served hot from the oven.

      Title: Fruit Sweet & Sugar Free - Southern Style Buttermilk Bisc
 Categories: Diabetic, Breads/bm
      Yield: 14 biscuits
 
------------------------------DRY INGREDIENTS------------------------------
      2 c  Unbleached white flour;             1 ts Baking soda;
      2 c  Whole wheat pastry flour;         1/2 ts Salt;
      1 tb Baking powder;                

------------------------------WET INGREDIENTS------------------------------
     10 tb Cold butter;                        2 tb Fruit sweetener;
  1 7/8 c  Buttermilk;                    
 
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment
  paper. Sift the dry ingredients into a large bowl. Cut the butter into 1/2
  inch pieces. Use the fingers and thumb of each hand to rub in the butter
  until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Be sure to lift your hands out
  of the bowl while simultaneously using your thumbs to run the flour and
  butter across your fingers. Make a well in the center. In a small bowl,
  combine the buttermilk and fruit sweetener. Pour them into the center of
  the dry ingredients. Form a rough dough, mixing quickly and gently with
  your hands or a wooden spoon. Place the biscuit dough on a lightly floured
  work surface, and knead it no more than 10 times. Use a rolling pin or your
  hands to form it into a 3/4 inch thick rectangle. Lightly dust a plan
  2-inch or 3-inch cutter with flour. Cut the biscuits with a straight
  cutting motion, being careful not to twist the cutter. To reuse the scraps,
  do not knead them. Instead use your fingers to lightly press them together
  and pat them out to make a 3/4 inch thickness. Place the cut biscuits on a
  baking paper lined or ungreased baking sheet. Leave at least 1 inch of
  space around each biscuit for crusty evenly browned biscuits. Bake the
  biscuits in the preheated oven for 20-22 minutes, until golden brown. Let
  the biscuits cool on the baking sheet before removing them.

  sweetener. Stir until the yeast is moistened. Then set the bowl aside until
  the yeast is bubbly, at least 5 minutes. Sift the flours, baking powder,
  baking soda, and salt together into a medium sized bowl. Cut the butter
  into 1/2 inch pieces. Use the fingers and thumb of each hand to rub in the
  pieces of butter until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Be sure to
  lift your hands out of the bowl while simulatneously using your thumbs to
  rub the flour and butter across your fingers. Make a well in the center. In
  a small bowl, combine the buttermilk with the remaining 1 tablespoon fruit
  sweetener and the activated yeast. Pour them into the center of the dry
  ingredients. Form a rough dough, mixing quickly and gently with your hands.
  Cover the bowl with plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to
  375 degrees, line a baking pan with baking paper. Remove from the
  refrigerator that portion of the dough you want to make into biscuits and
  knead it until smooth, 10-15 kneads. Roll the dough out 3/4 inch thick.
  With a lightly floured cutter, cut out 2-3 inch biscuits. Place the
  biscuits on the prepared pan and bake until golden brown, about 15-20
  minutes. Serve Angel Biscuits hot from the oven.
  
  Angel biscuit dough can be kept in the refrigerator up to one week before

  Notes:  Mince garlic.  Thinly slice onion, then cut into thirds. Cut
  chicken into strips. Mushrooms should be oyster or shittake, sliced or left
  whole, depending on the type. Heat the oil in a heavy pot. Add the garlic,
  onion, and shallots, and cook until light golden. Keep the pot covered
  between stirrings and use a tablespoon or so of the wine if more liquid is
  needed. Add the strips of chicken and enough of the wine to keep the meat
  from sticking to the pot. Cook until the chicken is white all the way
  through, about 5 to 7 minutes (use more wine, if needed). Remove the
  chicken and sauteed vegetables with a slotted spoon. Add the vinegar to the
  pot, increase the heat, and stir with a wooden spoon, scraping bits from
  the bottom, until the liquid is reduced to about half its volume. Reduce
  the heat. Return the chicken and sauteed vegetables to the pot, add the
  broccoli, mushrooms, stock, remaining wine, and salt. Cook at a gentle
  simmer until the broccoli turn bright green. Serve over pasta or brown
  rice, and dust with pepper. Protein: 30 grams Carb: 8 grams Sodium: 224 mg

 Categories: Diabetic, Poultry, Mian dish, Oriental
      Yield: 1 serving
 
      1 md To lg whole chicken,                1 pk Fresh spinach
           -cut into pieces                         -(or approximately 10 oz.)
           -(option: skin removed)            10 c  12 c. water
      3    Chayote squash, peeled,             1 md Onion; sliced
           -deseeded and sliced              1/4 c  1/3 c FRESH ginger;
      8 cl To 12 cloves of garlic,                  -peeled and julienned
           -crushed with a knife flat          2 tb Canola oil
           -and chopped fine                   4 tb Patis (fish sauce)*
      5    6 jalapenos, serranos or                 -approximately
           -habaneros, whole                 1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
 
  In a LARGE pot lightly saute the garlic in the oil until lightly brown. Add
  ginger and onions, cook till onions turn translucent. Add chicken pieces,
  mix well. Add patis and black pepper to mixture. Add at LEAST 10 cups of
  water. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat, cook until the chicken
  is tender, about 45 minutes. When chicken is done, add the chayote squash
  and the chiles, then return to a boil and cook over a medium heat for about
  10-15 minutes until the squash is tender. Then, add the spinach on top of
  the soup, cover and cook until spinach wilts, about 1-2 minutes. Serve with
  brown rice, and the traditional Filipino way is to take one of the cooked
  chiles out and put it in a small bowl with enough patis to cover, then
  smash the chile up in the sauce. You then use the chile/patis mixture to
  season, if it's not salty enough. * This is easiest found in an oriental
  grocery. The best brand is Rufina, if you can't get that, Tiparos (from
  Thailand) is OK.

    1/4 c  Raisins;                       
 
  Mix ingedients except oranges in a saucepan.  Simmer over low heat until
  honey is melted about 3 minutes.  Set aside.  Peel oranges, and slice them
  into quarters.  Place oranges slices in a small baking dish, and pour sauce
  over them.  Broil for 6 to 8 minutes.  Watch closely. You don't want slices
  to burn, but the sauce should thicken slightly. Serve warm. I don't keep
  honey in the house....have no idea what this is like with honey in it. I
  made it anyhow and used a sugar substitute. My big kid really liked it with
  a little whipping cream. (light)

      2    Eggs                           
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly spray two loaf pans with lecithin
  spray. Toast the walnuts in the preheated oven for 7-10 minutes, stirring
  occasionally. Allow the nuts to cool. Then coarsely chop them with a knife
  or using a pulsing action in a food processor, and put them aside. Wash and
  sort the cranberries, coarsely chop them with a knife or with the pulsing
  action in a food processor and put them aside. Sift the dry ingredients
  together. Use an electric mixer on medium speed to whisk together the
  sweetener, oil, and orange zest, until thickened, about five minutes. Add
  the eggs, one at a time beating well after each addition. Reduce speed and
  stir in the orange juice, vanilla and mashed bananas. On low speed, slowly
  add the sifted dry ingredients, walnuts, and cranberries. Mix just until
  blended, being careful not to over mix. Pour the batter into the prepared
  loaf pans. Bake the loaves on the middle shelf in the preheated oven for
  50-60 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center of each loaf comes
  out clean. Cool the loaves slightly before removing them from the pans and
  cooling them on a wire rack. Wrap the cooled loaves in plastic wrap and let
  them sit for a few hours to overnight at room temperature before slicing.
