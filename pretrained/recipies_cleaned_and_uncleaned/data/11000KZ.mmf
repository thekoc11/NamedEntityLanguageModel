      Title: ORIENTAL HOT WINGS *
 Categories: Chinese, Chicken, Wings, Appetizers
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Soy sauce
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Sesame seeds
      1 tb Cayenne pepper
 
  Combine the following ingredients to make a marinade:
  
  Cut 2-3 lbs of wings into 3 pieces.  Discard the wingtips and
  marinate the remaining pieces for at least 30 minutes. Agitate the
  pieces occasionally while they are marinating.
  
  Cover a cookie pan with foil and, using tongs, place the marinated
  wing pieces on it.   I suggest using a cookie PAN, as opposed to a
  sheet, because the sides will insure that none of the marinade
  mixture drips off the edge and screws up your oven.  There should be
  a slight seperation between each individual piece so they don't stick
  together.
  
  Cook for one hour at 350 F, turning the wing pieces every 10 minutes.
  If you want them to come out nice and even, you need to turn them
  individually with a pair of tongs. If you don't turn them, they'll
  stick and burn on one side.
  
  After they are done, let stand for at least 20 minutes. Serve hot or

     portion of the dough to 3mm thickness using a rolling pin or sharp
     knife. Roll up the sheet of pasta completely and cut into 5mm wide
     strips. Carefully unroll the strands.
  
     Repeat the process with the remaining portions of dough. Spread
  onto
     a dry tea towel and sprinkle with plain flour. Set aside.
  
  3. Prepare the sauce whilst the pasta is standing. Heat the oil in a
  pan
     and add the chilli, spring onion and snow peas. Cook over a low
  heat
     for 2-3 minutes. Add the sesame oil , soy sauce, vinegar, cashew
  paste,

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     12 lg Oranges
    200 g  Sugar (7 oz)
      3 tb Grand Marnier or Cointreau
      2 tb Grenadine syrup
 
  ORANGES A L'ORIENTALE Peel the zest from the oranges in long strips,
  taking as little of the pith as possible. Cut the zest into very,
  very fine julienne strips. Remove the pith in vertical strips to
  expose the flesh of the oranges. Then, holding the oranges over a
  strainer with a bowl beneath to catch all the juice, cut each segment
  away from the membranes that divide one from another, and from the
  central core of pith. Squeeze all the discarded membranes to extract
  every drop of juice, if any flesh remains on them, and add it to the
  already collected juice. Blanch the julienned zest in bouling water
  for 1 minute. Refresh in cold water and drain in a sieve. Put the
  sugar into a large, wide saucepan and cook over a moderate, steady
  heat until the sugar melts and becomes a light golden color. Add the
  collected orange juice and, stirring to mix well, cook until the
  liquid has the consistency of a light syrup. Add the julienned zest
  to the sysrup, as well as the liqueur and the grenadine syrup. If a
  scum forms, remove it with a spoon as if you were making jam. Bring
  it briefly to the boil. Add the orange segments and shake the pan
  well so that they all absorb the syrup. They should be hot, but they
  should not be allowed to cook. Set the pan aside. Add another drop of
  liqueur to the pan. SERVING: Arrange the segments on four plates to
  look like stars. Coat them with the sysrup and decorate with the
  julienned zests. ALTERNATIVELY: Serve the oranges in a fruit dish,
  with a selection of some other fruit desserts.

 Categories: Poultry, Foreign
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Plums for babies,canned
           -pureed
      3 tb Dry white wine
      2 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Firmly packed brown sugar
      2 tb Lemon juice
      2 tb Finely chopped green onion,
           -including tops
    1/2 ts Chinese five spice

    1/2 ts Ground allspice
      6    Chicken legs,thighs attached
           -skin and fat pulled off
           Fresh cilantro sprigs
 
  Nearly 50 years ago, during the food shortages of World War II, SUNSET
  MAGAZINE deplored the use of canned baby food (always, apparently, in
  good supply) as a substitute for scarcer products. Now after half a
  century, we turn to baby food once again, this time to recommend it
  as a principle ingredient in Maureen W. Valentine's Oriental
  Plum-Glazed Chicken.
  
  Why baby-food plums? They're already pureed, saving preparation time,
  and they're available all year.
  
  =======================================================
  ============== ====
  
  Mix together plums, wine, soy, sugar, lemon juice, onion, and five
  spice.
  
  Rinse chicken and pat dry. Arrange legs in a 10x15" pan. Brush with
  plum sauce. Bake, uncovered, in a 375'F. oven for 25 minutes. Turn
  chicken pieces over, brush with remaining plum sauce, and continue to
  bake until meat at thigh bone is no longer pink (cut to test), 20-25
  minutes longer. Baste with pan juices during last 10 minutes of
  baking.
  
  Lift Chicken onto a platter and garnish with cilantro. Skim fat from
  pan juices; add 1/4 cup water to pan and stir over high heat just
  until boiling. Serve juices with chicken.

  1 1/2 tb Soy sauce
      3 x  Stalks Bok Choy  **
      1 x  Sweet red Pepper, julienned
      1 c  Broccoli florets
      1 x  Carrot, shredded
      1 c  Sliced Mushrooms (3 oz)
    1/2 c  Peas
      2 oz Buckwheat Noodles (1/2 cup)
    1/2 lb Firm Tofu, cut in 1/2" cubes
    1/4 c  Watercress leaves
 
  *    or 2 scallions, chopped ** diagonally sliced, also shred leaves
  GARNISH: blanched peapods, thin scallion slices, celery leaves,
  toasted sesame seeds, finely shredded lettuce or watercress leaves,
  Optional. Place 1/2 cup of the vegetable stock in a Dutch oven or 3
  1/2 - 5 qt saucepan and bring to a boil. Add onion, garlic, and
  gignger; simmer for 3 minutes. Stir in remaining stock and soy sauce.
  Cover pot and bring to a gentle boil. Add remaining ingredients. Test
  for doneness: noodles should be softened; vegetables should remain
  crisp/tender. Timing - about 8 minutes. Top each serving with one of
  the garnishes. VARIATIONS: - substitute 1 c cooked brown rice for the
  buckwheat noodles - substitute or add other vegetables such as
  chopped green peppers, chopped water chestnut, chopped jicama root,
  shredded spinach, chopped celery, or bamboo shoots. ~ to shorten prep
  time, use only 2 vegetables- onion and peas - for a "hotter" soup,
  subst. 1/2-1 t dry crushed red pepper - stir in 1 t toasted Sesame
  Oil or 1/2 t Chinese hot oil just before serving ~ for additional
  protein and flavor, stir Egg Threads into soup just before serving
  EGG THREADS: In a small skillet, heat a little margarine. When it
  begins to bubble, add 1 egg beaten with a little cold water. Tilt the
  pan so the yolk mixture coats it in a thin layer, the thinner the
  better. When the egg is lightly cooked, turn it out onto a cutting
  board. Slice it into very thin strips with a sharp knife. (makes
  about 1/3 cup)

      2 c  Buttermilk baking mix
    1/3 c  Chopped green onions
      2 tb Oil
      1 c  Minced shrimp

    1/4 c  Apricot preserves
    1/2 c  Packed brown sugar
      2 tb Cider vinegar
      2 tb Soy sauce
    1/2 ts Dry mustard
 
  Looking for a new way to treat some leftovers, Margaret Thompson of
  Chicago, an innovative cook, decided to use chop suey as a filling
  for a French-style chicken roll. The dish was such a success that she
  went one step further and concocted a delicious Oriental-style
  filling of her own. Buttermilk baking mix gives the chicken an
  extra-crunchy coating, topped by a sauce quickly made from apricot
  preserves. To round out the menu, Mrs. Thompson serves crisp Chinese
  noodles or steamed rice, cabbage slaw with an oil-vinegar dressing,
  fruit compote with Chinese almond cookies and tea.
  
  Place chicken between pieces of waxed paper and with a mallet or
  broad side of a cleaver, pound thin.  Dredge in baking mix; set
  chicken and baking mix aside.
  
  In large skillet, saute onions in oil until tender. Add shrimp, water
  chestnuts, bean sprouts, soy sauce and bouillon; cook and stir until
  shrimp are opaque.
  
  Add cornstarch mixture; cook and stir until thickened.
  
  Place 2 tablespoons filling at one end of each breast half; roll up
  and secure with toothpicks.  Dip in egg mixture; roll in remaining
  baking mix.
  
  Heat oil in fryer to 400~F.  Fry rolls 2 at a time 10 minutes or until
  golden brown. Drain; keep warm in 300~ oven until serving time. Serve
  with Sweet-sour Apricot Sauce.
  
  NOTE: chicken can be pounded and dredged and filling can be made a day
  ahead. Refrigerate until ready to use. Sauce keeps refrigerated at
  least one month.
  
  Sauce Combine all ingredients in small saucepan. Stir over medium-low
  heat until sugar dissolves. Serve warm or at room temperature.

           Pepper to taste
      1    Scallion, sliced thin, for
           -garnish
 
  * Chop stems and leave caps whole In a large saucepan, combine 6 cups
  water with the lemon juice, add the mushroom caps, and bring the
  liquid to a boil.  Simmer the mushroom caps for 6 mintues, transfer
  tham to paper towels, and let them drain. (Blanching the mushroom
  caps will prevent them from wrinkling while they are baking.) In a
  skillet, cook the bacon over moderate heat until it is crisp,
  transfer it to paper towels, and let it drain.  Pour off all but
  1-1/2 tbsp of the fat from the skillet, in the remaining fat cook the
  onion, the garlic, and the mushroom stems over moderately low
  heat,stirring, until the vegetables are softened, and add the soy
  sauce, the sesame seeds, 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs, the bacon,
  crumbled, and pepper to taste. Cook the mixture, stirring, for 1
  minutes, or until it is slightly dry, divide it among the mushroom
  caps, mounding it, and transfer the stuffed mushrooms to a jelly-roll
  pan. The mushrooms may be prepared up to this point 1 day in advance
  and kept covered tightly with plastic wrap and chilled. Sprinkle the
  remaining 1 tbsp bread crumbs over the mushrooms and bake the
  mushrooms in the middle of a preheated 325 F oven for 7 minutes, or
  until the filling is heated through. To make the filling crisper, the
  cooked mushrooms may be put under a preheated broiler about 4 inches
  from the heat for 1 minute. Garnish the mushrooms with the scallion.
  Makes 24 stuffed mushrooms.

  flour seasoned with the garlic powder, pepper and salt until they are
  fully coated. Heat oil between 350 and 360 F., or until a drop of
  beaten egg rises bubbly to the surface.  Deep fry several at a time
  until golden brown and crisp. Drain on paper towels. Mix teriyaki
  sauce and honey. After wings have drained, but are still hot, brush

      Title: ORIGINAL BUFFALO WINGS
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      5 lb Fresh large chicken wings
           Peanut oil for frying
           Durkee/French Hot Sauce
           Wingers Original Recipe Hot
           Melted Margarine
           Celery Sticks
           Chunky Blue Cheese Salad Dre
 
  1. Split the wings at the joint and remove the tips. Anchor Bar has
  barrels of tips they use in soup stock. 2. Spread the wings out on a
  rack in a pan and refrigerate so they drain of moisture/blood.A
  minimum of 24 hours. This small step will help produce a 'crispier'
  final product. 3 Heat deep fryerto 350-360 degrees. 4. Fry wings in
  small batches until done-8-10 minutes, depending on the equipment. 5
  Drain of excess oil and immediately place in large bowl and coat with
  hot sauce & melted margarine. 6. Serve with celery sticks and blue
  cheese. NOTE:The amounts of Hot Sauce and Margarine are really to
  taste. Medium 'HEAT' Wings are approx. obtained by using 1 cup of Hot
  Sauce for the entire 5# and 1/2c. of melted margaine. Experiment-some
  places do not use the melted marg. at all and just vary the volume of
  hot sauce to get the taste they want. The background on "Orginal
  Buffalo Chicken Wings" is this: Frank & Theressa's Anchor Bar is
  where it all started. Theressa Bellissimo received by mistake a 30#
  box of wings,ususally used in making soup. Her husband Frank asked
  her one night to fix a snack at the restaurant for he and a bunch of
  his friends. Theressa decided that these wings would be just the
  thing and went out and bought a bottle(s) of cayenne pepper sauce.
  There were many varieties and one was named "FRANKS". She deep fried
  the split wings, mixed the Franks Hot Sauce with some melted
  margarine and coated the deep fried wings. That in short was the
  beginning of an industry. It was 1964, and the Anchor Bar was the
  only spot you could get these things. The secret was in the sauce and
  the sauce was Franks Hot sauce,which was produced by the Frank Tea &
  Spice Co, later on bought by Durkee Foods and now a part of the
  Durkee/French Foods Co.However,back then most folks thought FRANK
  Bellissimo, invented the sauce! Actually,he was more famous around
  here than Dr. Jacob Frank who perfected the Louisiana Sunlong Pepper
  which was the base for the product. Anyway,today the Bellissimo's and
  their son Dominic are all part of history. It was Dominic who
  went"public" with the product and told the story from here to London
  Eng. and to countless publications. The Anchor Bar today is run by
  his wife and still does thousands of pounds of wings a week. ENJOY!!

 Categories: Pies, Desserts, Fruits, American
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 ea Unflavored gelatin
    1/4 c  Water
    2/3 c  Sugar; divided
    1/2 c  Key lime juice
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 ts Grated lime rind
      4 ea Eggs; separated
      1 x  9" baked pastry shell
 
  I got this recipe from a "Cracker," and it will dispute the previous
  statement that all will agree on how to make the best Key Lime Pie.
  My tree froze, but came back, so we've enjoyed this recipe a lot this
  year. Mix together gelatin, 1/3 c sugar and salt in saucepan. Combine
  slightly beaten egg yolks, water & lime juice. Add to gelatin
  mixture. Place over low heat, stirring constantly, until gelatin
  dissolves, about 6 min. Remove from heat and add rind. Cool. Beat egg
  whites until stiff but not dry. Gradually add remaining 1/3 c sugar
  and beat until stiff. Fold in gelatin mixture. Turn into pastry shell
  and chill until firm. Garnish with whipped cream and lime slices if
  desired. Note: To make lime chiffon cream pie, fold in 1/2 c heavy
  cream, whipped before turning into pastry shell. This is a much
  lighter pie than the one using sweetened condensed milk, and I think
  it has a more of the flavor of Key limes. Ann, Fl. FROM: ANN NEWTON

      Title: ORIGINAL RECIPE KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN
 Categories: Kfc, Chicken, Top secret
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6 c  Crisco cooking oil
      1    Egg, beaten
      2 c  Milk
      2 c  All-purpose flour
      4 tb Salt
      2 ts Black pepper
      1 ts MSG (you can use Accent)
      2    Frying chickens with skin,
           -each cut into 6 pieces
 
  "In 1983, in his book BIG SECRETS, author William Poundstone hired a
  laboratory to analyze a dry sampling of the spice mixture. The
  surprising discovery was that instead of identifying 'eleven herbs
  and spices,' the analysis showed only four ingredients: flour, salt,
  pepper and monosodium glutamate, a flavor enhancer.  The cooking
  procedure is believed to be the other half of the secret. Colonel
  Sanders became famous for using a pressure cooker shortly after its
  invention in 1939."
  
  Pour the oil into a pressure cooker and heat over medium heat to
  about 400 degrees.  In a small bowl, combine the egg and milk. In a
  separate bowl, combine the remaining four dry ingredients. Dip each
  piece of chicken into the milk until fully moistened. Roll the
  moistened chicken in the flour mixture until completely coated. In
  groups of four or five, drop the covered chicken pieces into the oil
  and lock the lid in place. When steam begins shooting through the
  pressure release, set the timer for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes,
  release the pressure and remove the chicken to paper towels or a
  metal rack to drain. Repeat with the remaining chicken.
  
  Note:  If you prefer not to use MSG, you may substitute an additional
  1/2 Tbsp. of salt.  Be aware, however, that using MSG produces the
  best clone of KFC's Fried Chicken.

  Maybe the general world IS getting healthier... veg. meals seemed
  fairly available, and sometimes even VLF veg meals. Morocco in Epcot
  had great steamed veg. couscous, and the Polynesian Revue (with
  advance request) prepared a large plate of steamed mixed vegetables
  and baked potato that made a good meal (w/the fruit plate that was
  everyone's appetizer).
  
  I actually can't recommend the vegetarian place in Magic Kingdom
  (Sleepy Hollow), since it seemed like their offerings were higher fat
  (even the bagel chips they sell are fatty). Of course, my SAD husband
  wouldn't have eaten there anyways.  It is a good parade watching spot
  so we had a snack stop there so I could peek at the menu.
  
  There was only one meal that I really got stuck eating something I
  didn't want to.  And it wasn't hard bringing in snacks & drinks in a
  backpack either.
  
  Outside of Disneyworld, everyone (SAD and VLF and 4.75 yo) liked
  Pebbles, which is in the Crossroads Shopping Center. There's also a
  supermarket there where I got my best Florida souvenier: Rotel
  tomatoes!! ... my husband did ask why I was bringing back canned
  tomatoes :-)
  
  And Delta did amazingly well with our special meal requests; the
  vegetarian meals were LF to VLF (including Guiltless Gourmet chips
  w/salsa!).

      Title: ORNAMENTS OF DOUGH (INEDIBLE)
 Categories: Crafts, Holidays, Kids
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
MMMMM---------------------LISA CRAWLEY/TSPN--------------------------
      2 c  All Purpose Flour
      2 c  Water
      1 c  Salt
      2 tb Cream of Tartar
           Food Coloring
           6 Loops of String or Wire
           Plastic Bags
 
  1. Dough- In a medium saucepan, mix together the flour, water, salt,
  and cream of tartar. 2. Heat on medium heat and stir constantly until
  the mixture is thick and satiny. 3. Let cool to room temperature. 4.
  Divide dough into two parts and place into two plastic bags.
  
  COLORING DOUGH 1.) You decide what food coloring you want to add. Put
  about ten drops of food coloring into each bag. Then squeeze the
  dough inside the bag until it is evenly colored. You can add more
  food coloring, two drops at a time, until the color is as deep as you
  want.
  
  2.) OR leave the dough uncolored, and later you can paint the finished
  ornaments with tempera or watercolor paints.
  
  SHAPING 1). Mold into shapes with your hands. 2.) OR flatten the
  dough, and cut out the shapes with cookie cutters. 3.) Either way, be
  sure to mold the dough around a looped string or wire so that you
  will be able to hang the finished ornament.
  
  FINISHING ORNAMENTS 1. Let the dough ornaments dry thoroughly, 24
  hours or so. If the weather is damp and the ornaments aren't drying
  properly, then you may want to dry them in the oven. In that case,
  dry the ornaments at 200 F for 30 minutes. 2.) Paint the ornaments
  with tempera or water colors. (Even if you colored the dough, you may
  want to paint in details.) 3.) If you plan on keeping the ornaments
  for more than a few weeks, finish by brushing them with clear shellac.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2    Portabello mushrooms
      1 c  (before cooking) orzo
      4 oz Sundried tomatoes
      4    Cloves minced garlic (or to
           Taste)
      2 tb Capers (or to taste--this
           Recipe is pretty loose it

           Oregano
      1 c  White wine
        x  Salt and crushed red pepper
           To taste
 
  you can make this in under 30 minutes if you do it all at once. so
  put the water on to boil for the orzo, and put the sundried tomatoes
  in a bowl with about a cup of water to reconstitute (rinse them off
  first as you will use the soaking water later). wash the portabellos
  and cut off the stems. put caps in a dish and sprinkle with the three
  herbs, then pour the cup of wine over them to marinate. coarsely chop
  the mushroom stems, mince the garlic. in a nonstick pan, sautee the
  garlic and mushroom stems in a little tomato water or wine. drain
  tomatoes, reserving the liquid, and chop coarsely (it's okay if they
  are not fully softened at this point) and sautee. the water should be
  boiling now so put the orzo on to cook. scoot the
  tomato/garlic/chopped mushroom mixture to the edges of the pan and
  place mushroom caps in the middle. pour the tomato water over them,
  cover, and simmer until the mushrooms are finished, about 12 minutes
  (same time as it takes the orzo to cook--hey!). remove the mushroom
  caps to a plate (to two plates I mean) and pour the leftover
  marinating wine into the pan, and add capers. cook and stir until
  reduced. drain orzo and toss with the mixture, and serve with the
  mushroom caps. yum! (I was bad and garnished this with toasted pine
  nuts and it was great, but I am eating nutless leftovers now and it
  is still really good). sorry my recipes are always so rambling.

  In a medium-sized heavy saucepan, heat oil over medium heat. Add
  barley and cook, stirring until golden and toasted, about 5 minutes.
  Add garlic and stir for 1 minute more. Pour in chicken stock and
  bring to a boil. Add orzo and thyme.  Stir once, reduce heat to low,
  cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let rest for 5
  minutes to absorb any remaining liquid. Stir in chives or scallion
  greens. Season with salt and pepper. Serves 4.
  
  (Footnote:  I am perplexed by that "cutlet cut in half." Which way,
  do you think?  Personally, I would do it the long way, that is making
  two long, thinner pieces from the thicker cutlet so it would cook
  quickly.

      Title: ORZO SALAD W/WILD MUSHROOMS & ASPARAGUS
 Categories: S, L, D
      Yield: 50 Buffet ser
 
 
  6 medium red or yellow bell peppers
    1 1/2    cups olive oil Salt and freshly ground black
  
  Slice 1/3 inch thick: 2 lbs. fresh shiitake mushrooms, stems
  discarded, caps sliced 1 lbs. fresh chanterrelles, 2 lbs. white
  mushrooms, sliced 1/3" 3 lbs. thin asparagus, cut into 2 1/2-inch
  lengths 4 medium leeks, white and tender green, split lengthwise and
  sliced crosswise 1" thick 4 pounds orzo 1/4 C. fresh lemon juice (I
  add much more lemon juice) 1 cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf
  parsley
  
  1. Bring a large stockpot of water to a boil. Meanwhile, roast the
  bell peppers directly over gas flames or under a broiler, turning
  often, until charred all over. Transfer to a paper bag and let steam
  for 15 minutes. Discard the blackened skins, stems, seeds, and ribs.
  Chop the peppers into 1-inch pieces.
  
  NOTE: Peppers can be prepared easily a day ahead by slicing in
  quarters, removing seeds and membranes, roasting skin side up under a
  broiler until skins are black. Then place peppers in a zip-lock bag
  and refrigerate overnight. The next morning, the skins will slip
  right off.
  
  2. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large nonstick skillet. Add
  half of the shiitakes and cook over high heat, stirring, until
  browned, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and transfer
  to a large platter. Repeat the process with the remaining shiitakes,
  white mushrooms, and chanterelles, adding 2 tablespoons of oil for
  each batch; cook the white mushrooms in 2 batches and the
  chanterelles in 1 batch.
  
  3. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the skillet. Add the asparagus,
  season with salt and pepper, and cook over moderately high heat,
  stirring often, until browned and tender but still slightly firm,
  about 5 minutes. Transfer to the platter with the mushrooms. Add 1
  more tablespoon of olive oil to the skillet. Add the leeks, season
  with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring often, until wilted and
  beginning to brown, about 7 minutes. Add to the other vegetables.
  
  4. Add 2 tablespoons salt to the boiling water. Add the orzo and cook,
  stirring often, until al dente, about 10 minutes. Drain, rinse with
  cold water, and drain again thoroughly. Transfer to a very large
  bowl. Add all the vegetables and toss. In a small bowl, combine the
  lemon juice, parsley, and the remaining 3/4 cup olive oil. Pour the
  dressing over the orzo and toss again. Season with sale and pepper.
  (The salad can be prepared up to 2 days ahead; cover and refrigerate.
  Let return to room temperature before serving.

      Title: OSAS
 Categories: Side dish, Pancakes, Indian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
     14 oz Patna or long grain rice
           Washed in several changes
           Of water
      7 oz Urad dal
      1 ts Salt
     10 fl Oz vegetable oil
 
  Soak the rice and urad dal in separate bowls of water for about 2
  hours. The water should cover them by around 1 inch. Drain. Blend the
  urad dal with 6 fl oz water in an electric blender for 5 - 8 minutes
  until it is pale, smooth, light and airy. Empty the mixture into a
  large bowl.
  
  Put the rice and 6 tablespoons of water into the blender and blend
  until it turns into a fine granular paste. Add to the dal with the
  salt and mix gently. Cover and leave in a warm place like an airing
  cupboard to ferment for 24-26 hours. The batter should double in
  volume.
  
  Add 7 fl oz water fold in gently and leave in a warm place for a
  further 1 1/2 hours. Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons of oil in a frying pan and
  when hot, drop 4 fl oz of batter in the centre of the pan. Put the
  rounded bottom of a soup spoon very lightly into the center of the
  batter and using a slow, gentle and continuous spiral motion, spread
  the batter outwards with the back of the spoon until you have a
  pancake around 7 inches in diameter.
  
  Dribble 1/2 teaspoon of oil over the pancake and another 1/2 teaspoon
  round the edges. Cover and cook for 1 1/2 - 2 minutes, or until the
  dosa has turned reddish brown. Turn over and cook uncovered for a
  further minute or until the second side develops reddish spots.
  
  TIPS
  
  Urad dal is a small pale yellow split pea. Buy it from Indian grocers
  or substitute the more familiar yellow split peas available in
  supermarkets.

      2 tb Vegetable oil or clarified
           -butter
 
  Did my first cooking out of my new Indonesian cookbook last night. I
  fixed a stir fried carrot dish to back up a pork/soy stew (originally
  posted by Jen Kuiper) and plain white rice. Both are very easy to fix
  and quite good. Here's the particulars.
  
  These are carrots, cut into matchsticks and cooked in a little oil or
  butter. The word wortel doesn't sound Indonesian and isn't. It is
  borrowed from the Dutch name for the carrot, since it was the Dutch
  who introduced this vegetable to Indonesia.
  
  Peel, wash, and cut the carrots into small sticks. Slice the shallots
  and chilli.  Crush the garlic.  In a wok, heat 2 tablespoons of
  vegetable oil or clarified butter. Saute the slice shallots and
  chilli for 1 minute, then add the garlic and the carrots. Stir
  continuously for a minute or so and then put in the stock, or soya
  sauce and water. Cover and continue to cook for 4 minutes.  Uncover,
  taste, and add salt if necessary. Cook for a further 2 minutes,
  stirring all the time. Serve hot.

  to 450 Degrees F. Lightly oil 2 baking sheets or coat them with
  nonstick cooking spray.
  :        In a large bowl, combine 1 cup of the flour with the baking
  soda and salt. stir in yogurt. gradually add just enough of the
  remaining flour until the dough has lost its stickiness and can be
  worked with your hands. Turn the dough out onto a lightly flour work
  surface and knead until soft and slightly elastic, 3 to 4 minutes.
  divide the dough into 8 equal pieces.
  :       To assemble and bake breads: Working with one piece at a
  time, and keeping the remaining dough covered, flatten the dough with
  the palm of your hand, then either stretch or roll out the dough to a
  circle 6 to 8 inches in diameter.
  :       Spoon 2 Tb of the filling on the the center of the dough.
  Gently stretch the edges of the dough over the filling until you have
  a dough-covered mound. Pinch pleats closed and then, with the palm of
  your hand, gently press down on the top of the mound to flatten it.
  Turn the bread over and press again on the other side. this will push
  the filling to the edges of the bread. It should now be not more than
  1/2 : thick and 7 to 8 inches in diameter.
  :       Transfer the filled circles, pleated side down, to a prepared
  baking sheet. Once the first baking sheet is full bake the breads on
  the lowest rack (or with the sheet directly on the quarry tiles or
  baking stone)) for 6 to 8 minutes or until the breads are lightly
  browned on the bottom. Assemble the remaining breads while the first
  batch bakes. Remove the breads from the oven and transfer to a basket
  lined with a towel. Bake the remaining breads in the same fashion.

      Title: OSSO BUCO
 Categories: Meats, Italian, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 oz Butter
    1/2 c  Thinly sliced onion
      2 lg Veal shanks (5 1/2-to-6 lb)
           - cut in 3 pieces each
           Flour for dredging
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 c  White wine
      1 tb Tomato paste; dissolved in
    1/2 c  Water
      1 lg Clove garlic; minced
      1 tb Minced parsley
    1/2    Lemon; Grated peel only
 
  The garlic-parsley-lemon peel finish is called "gremolata" and is
  classic. The hollow bone (osso buco) of the veal shanks gives this
  dish its name. MELT THE BUTTER in a large casserole. Add the sliced
  onion and saute over medium heat until soft and just beginning to
  color (about 10 minutes). With a slotted spoon, remove the onion to a
  plate and press it against the plate to extract its juices and let
  them run back into the pan. Discard the onion. Dry the veal pieces
  with paper towels. Flour them lightly and brown them over medium heat
  in the onion-flavored butter. Salt and pepper the pieces, raise heat
  to medium-high and pour on half the wine. After a moment, turn the
  pieces of veal over, salt and pepper the other sides. Pour on the
  rest of the wine when the first half has evaporated. When all the
  wine has evaporated, arrange the veal pieces so that the wide marrow
  opening is up. Add the diluted tomato paste, cover, and cook over low
  heat about 1 1/2 hours, or until the veal is tender. During that
  time, move the pieces around to prevent them from sticking, and baste
  them occasionally with their cooking juices, using a bulb baster, but
  don't turn them over lest the marrow dissolve and run out. (You can
  add a tablespoon or 2 of warm water if the sauce seems to be drying
  out--but the veal will probably exude plenty of its own juices after
  the first half hour of cooking.) While the veal is cooking, finely
  chop together the garlic, parsley and lemon. Five minutes before
  serving, stir it into the casserole. Classically, this dish is served
  with risotto Milanese, made with saffron and Parmesan cheese, but any
  simple rice or pasta preparation will do.

      1    Salt, pepper to taste
           Flour
      7 tb Unsalted butter
      3 tb Olive oil
  1 1/2 c  Dry white wine
  1 1/2 c  Onion, finely chopped
    3/4 c  Carrots, finely chopped
    3/4 c  Celery, finely chopped
      1 ts Garlic, minced
      4 c  Beef broth
  1 1/2 c  Plum tomatoes, chopped
           Bouquet garni
    1/2 ts Salt
      1    -
           Gremolata:
    1/2 c  Fresh parlsey, minced
      2 tb Lemon zest
      1 tb Garlic, minced
 
  Season the veal shanks with salt and pepper and dredge in the flour,
  shaking off excess.  In a heavy skillet, heat 3 Tbsp butter and 3
  Tbsp oil over mod-high heat. Brown the veal shanks, adding additional
  butter and oil if necessary.  Transfer the shanks as they are browned
  to a platter. Add wine to the skillet, boil the mixture, deglazing
  the pan, until the liquid is reduced to about a half cup. Reserve in
  a small bowl. In a flameproof casserole just large enough to hold the
  veal shanks in one layer, cook the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic
  in the remaining 4 Tbsp butter over mod-low heat, stirring
  occasionally, until the veggies are softened. Add the shanks and any
  accumulated juices to the casserole. Add the wine mixture, and enough
  broth to almost cover the shanks. Spread the tomatoes over the
  shanks, add the bouquet garni (6 fresh parsley sprigs, 4 fresh thyme
  sprigs, 1 bay leaf) and salt and pepper to taste. Bring the liquid to
  a simmer over moderately high heat. Braise the mixture, covered, in
  the middle of a preheated 325f oven for 2 hours, or until the veal is
  tender. Transfer the veal to an ovenproof serving dish with a slotted
  spoon. Discard the strings and keep the shanks warm. Strain pan
  juices into a saucepan, pressing hard on the solids. Skim off the
  fat. Boil for about 15 minutes or until reduced to about 3 cups.
  Baste the shanks in some of the reduced juices, and bake them,
  basting 3-4 more times, for 10 minutes or until the shanks are
  glazed. In a bowl, stir together the parsley, zest, and garlic.
  Sprinkle the shanks with the gremolata and pour some juice around and
  over them. Serve the remaining juices alongside in a boat. a 1974

  Pre-heat oven to 325 degrees. Using a small, thick-bottomed rondeau,
  heat the olive oil and butter over medium high. Season the veal shanks
  thoroughly with salt and pepper. Coat the veal shanks with flour,
  shake to remove any excess, and brown well. Remove veal shanks from
  rondeau. Make the sachet: Add the vegetables and the sachet to the
  pan. Stir to coat and place the veal shanks on top. Add the wine,
  tomato sauce and stock, adjust the seasoning, and bring the mixture
  to a boil. Cover and cook the veal shanks in the oven for 1 1/2
  hours, or until the meat is very tender Start the risotto: 1/3 cup
  diced onion 1/4 cup diced shallots 1 tablespoons minced garlic 1 1/2

MMMMM-----------------------SEASONING RUB----------------------------
  1 1/2 tb Pumpkin seeds
    1/2 ts Coriander seeds
    1/2    Inch of cinnamon stick
    1/4 ts Black peppercorns
      3 cl Garlic
      2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Dark roasted coffee; freshly
           .  ground

MMMMM----------------------------MEAT---------------------------------
      3    Ostrich or Rhea steaks;
           .  8oz  each

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      2 tb Butter; unsalted
      3 tb Shallots; chopped
    1/2 c  Mushrooms; sliced
      3 c  Chicken broth
    3/4    Piece vanilla bean; split
           .  lengthwise
           .  *OR*
           .  2 Tsp vanilla extract
    1/2 c  Half-and-half
 
  1. Place pumpkin and coriander seeds, cinnamon and peppercorns in a
  shallow baking pan and bake in a preheated 350-degree oven until the
  pumpkin seeds release their oils and turn light brown. Remove and
  grind in a food processor, blender or mortar and pestle with
  remaining rub ingredients. Grind to a fine powder.
  
  2. Rub the mixture onto steaks and refrigerate 2 to 4 hours.
  
  3. Thirty minutes before serving, melt butter in a 1 1/2 quart sauce
  pan. Add shallots and garlic and stir over medium-high heat until
  shallots wilt about 10 minutes. Add stock and vanilla bean and bring
  to a boil over high heat. Continue to boil the mixture until it is
  reduced to 2 cups. Strain sauce, removing vanilla bean. Split bean in
  half and scrape seeds into the reduced stock.
  
  4. Meanwhile, prepare the grill with high heat. Place steaks over
  coals and grill on two sides until rare, medium rare or as
  desired.(For a 3/4-inch rare steak, about 3 minute per side. Check
  often. Because the meat is low in fat, it cooks and toughens very
  quickly). Ostrich meat toughens quickly and is best cooked no longer
  than necessary.
  
  5. Add hslf-and-half and cook over medium-high heat until sauce is
  warm. Remove and serve with steak.

   * if available; or substitute fresh citrus leaves These banana leaf
  packets filled with a spicy fish mousse make great grill-it-yourself
  barbecued appetizers. The banana jackets make them wonderfully easy
  to hold in your hand as picnic food.  Or, if you prefer, the filling
  may be spread on toast points for a more formal presentation.
   Otak Otak comes in many variations throughout Southeast Asia. Each
  version contains a rempah, the Malay name for the hand-pounded
  seasoning pastes which are the bouquet garni of Southeast Asian
  cooking. The traditional Singapore Nonya rempah includes chiles,
  garlic, shallots, lemongrass, turmeric, candle nuts, and shrimp
  paste, although other spices and herbs may be used to enhance a
  particular dish. Like curry pastes, rempahs are traditionally pounded
  in a mortar. Although a hand- pounded paste is better, it is
  time-consuming and laborious for the average American cook. I
  recommend starting the paste in a spice mill and/or a mini-food
  processor, switching to a mortar for a final pounding to smooth out
  the rough edges.
   In Singapore, Otak Otak is usually made with a Spanish mackerel
  called tenggiri, but this recipe was developed with milder
  white-fleshed fish.
   1.  Prepare the Rempah.  [Recipe below.  S.C.] 2. Pat the fish dry
  and cut it into 2-inch pieces.  Put the fish in the work bowl of a
  food processor and chop into a fine paste. Add the salt, sugar, white
  pepper, and egg and process until fully incorporated, about 5
  seconds. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and stir in the cooled
  rempah. Beat with a wooden spoon or mix with your hands until smooth,
  about 5 minutes. Remove the spines from the lime leaves and cut the
  leaves into very fine shreds. Fold them into the fish mixture.
   3.  For each packet, dip a square of banana leaf into boiling water
  for 1 to 2 minutes; pat dry.  Spread 2 to 3 tablespoons of the fish
  mixture down the middle of the leaf to within 1 inch of the ends.
  Place a shrimp in the middle of the fish mousse and pat it into the
  filling to lie flat. Fold the long edges over the filling (they
  should overlap in the center) to make a flat long packet.  Press down
  lightly to flatten the packet a bit; press the ends shut and seal
  with toothpicks. (Packets may be prepared to this point up to 2 hours
  ahead of time and refrigerated.) 4. Place the banana leaf packets on
  a grill 3 to 4 inches over a medium-hot fire and cook for 3 minutes
  per side (open one to test for doneness before serving). Serve hot,
  warm, or at room temperature.
   Makes 24 packets.
   VAR1AT1ON:  Otak Otak can also be steamed.  Put the fish packets on a
  steaming tray in a wok filled with boiling water and steam over
  medium- high heat for 5 minutes.
   REMPAH:  (Spice Paste) 1 . Cut the chiles just below the stem. Shake
  the chiles to loosen the seeds. Discard the stem and seeds. Put the
  chiles into a bowl and cover them with warm water; soak for 15
  minutes (1 hour is better, if you have the time).
   2.  Cut off and discard the root from the lemongrass. Re move the
  tough outer leaves until you see a light purple ring. Use only the
  tender white mid-section; chop coarsely.
   3.  With the motor running, drop the lemongrass down the feed tube
  of a mini-processor; chop as fine as possible. Add the galangal; chop
  as fine as possible. Add the chiles and chop as fine as possible. Add
  the candle nuts, shallots, garlic, turmeric, ground coriander, and
  shrimp paste and process together into a paste (this may take 2 to 3
  minutes); scrape down the sides of the work bowl as necessary.
   4.  Heat 1/4 cup thick coconut milk in a saucepan over medium-high
  heat; stir continuously until thick and oily. Add the contents of the
  processor and cook gently until the mixture is fragrant and oily,
  about 5 minutes. Add the remaining coconut milk and bring to a boil,
  stirring constantly; cook until incorporated. Let cool before adding
  to the fish mixture. The rempah can be made a few hours ahead of
  time. From "Asian Appetizers" by Joyce Jue, Harlow and Ratner, 1991.

           No ingredients
 
  INGREDIENTS: Use butter or regular margarine in sticks. Do not use
  butter or margarine produced in tubs or squeeze bottles in baking. Do
  not use margarine type of products labeled "spread." They will not
  perform in the same way as butter or margarine and are not generally
  substitutable.
  
  Use all-purpose flour that has not been sifted in these recipes. If
  an old recipe calls for sifted flour, remove two tablespoons flour
  per cup instead of sifting.
  
  BAKING: Preheat oven for 5 minutes before baking.
  
  Place baking pans or cookie sheets in the center of the oven for best
  air circulation. This will help to avoid hot spots in the oven which
  could cause burning.
  
  EQUIPMENT: Hershey Kitchens' baking recipes are developed with shiny
  metal baking pans (pies are in glass pie plates). If you use dark
  metal baking pans, your baking time may be slightly less. If you use
  insulated bakeware, your baking time may be slightly longer. If you
  use glass baking dishes, lower your oven temperature 25'F.

           Candied red cherries (opt.)
           -- for bottom of molds
           Additional brandy or other
           -liquor
           -- for ripening pudding

MMMMM-------------------------HARD SAUCE------------------------------
    1/2 c  Butter; softened
  2 1/2 c  Sifted confectioners' sugar
      1 tb Brandy
           Few drops cream; if needed

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
           Holly sprigs
           Candied fruit or angelica
           Brandy
 
  Combine the dried fruits and peels in a large bowl and sprinkle with
  cognac.  Cover and place in the refrigerator overnight (or longer - in
  which case you may want to add more cognac).
  
  To the fruits in the large bowl, add nuts and suet. Resift flour with
  the baking soda, salt and spices; then sift over the fruit mixture
  while tossing and mixing with a wooden spoon to evenly distribute the
  dry ingredients.  Stir in jam and brown sugar.
  
  Prepare the bread crumbs (use the food processor, removing crusts
  first if they are crusty and hard). Sprinkle bread crumbs into the
  sherry, mixing with a fork. Add to the fruit mixture.
  
  Add the beaten egg yolks; mix thoroughly.  Last, fold in beaten egg
  whites.
  
  Prepare two pudding molds.  This recipe makes enough for one 2-quart
  mold, and the remainder can be steamed in a coffee can - a 26-ounce
  can makes a round pudding about 3" tall. (You could make one huge
  pudding if you have a container.)
  
  Grease molds with butter and then sprinkle them with sugar or dust
  with flour.  Arrange candied cherries in molds, if desired (cherries
  should be dusted with flour). Fill 2-quart mold no more than 2/3 full
  with batter. Cover pudding mold with its lid, fasten with clamps or
  tie on securely.
  
  For the coffee can, cover with its plastic lid, tie it on and wrap
  all with aluminum foil.  (The plastic will split.) For a bowl without
  a lid, cover the top with layered waxed paper tied down securely,
  then do the same with aluminum foil.

      Title: OUR FAMILY'S PLUM PUDDING 1992~ II/II
 Categories: British, Christmas, Desserts, Fruits, Harned 1994
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
           See below
 
  To steam the puddings:  Place each pudding in its own steaming
  container on a rack placed over gently boiling water (see note).
  Cover each kettle with a tight-fitting lid and steam puddings - 7
  hours for pudding in a 2-quart mold (6" tall, 7" across the top)
  filled 2/3 full; 6 hours for the smaller one.  Check the water level
  every hour or so, replenishing with boiling water as needed.
  
  When the pudding has finished steaming, uncover it and let it cool.
  Remove the pudding from the mold, if it is metal, and sprinkle 2 tb.
  or so of brandy, sherry, rum or fruit juice over the pudding. Wrap it
  in clean, unbleached muslin, then wrap it in foil and store it in the
  refrigerator to ripen for at least three weeks. Open from time to
  time and sprinkle judiciously with more liquor - or add it to the
  pudding cloth.
  
  When ready to serve, return to the pudding mold and steam as before
  for 1 1/2 hours.
  
  To serve: Place hot pudding on a warmed platter. Place a sprig of
  holly in the center and decorate sparingly with candied fruit or
  angelica. Carefully warm several tablespoons of brandy, and pour a
  bit at the rim of the platter.  Ignite brandy with a long-stemmed
  match and carry flaming to the table. Serve with hard sauce and/or
  brandy-flavored whipped cream.
  
  Yield: Each pudding serves 10 or more.  Makes 5 pounds of pudding or
  more.
  
  Note: The bottom of the pudding mold should be above the gently
  boiling water at all times so that the pudding is cooked by steam. It
  may take some ingenuity to find a way to raise the pudding above the
  water.
  
  Kluger wrote: "I steamed one pudding in a vegetable blancher, placing
  my canning funnel upside down in the perforated basket and placing
  the pudding mold on top of that. The second 'steamer' was contrived
  by placing a flat-bottomed colander upside down in the bottom of a
  hot-water-bath kettle. This made a nice platform for the pudding to
  stand on - about 2" above the bottom of the pan. Allow ample space
  between the pudding and the sides of the kettle so the steam can
  circulate."
  
  Note: If you want to freeze one of the puddings, cool it after
  steaming. Wrap in moisture-vapor-proof freezer wrap and store at 0 F.
  for up to 1 year.  When ready to eat, unwrap and thaw loosely covered
  in the refrigerator.  Then return to the pudding mold and steam as
  directed above for serving.
  
  To make hard sauce:  Using the small bowl of an electric mixer, beat
  the butter until creamy.  Add confectioners' sugar gradually, beating
  until mixture is creamy, about 5 minutes. Add the brandy.
  
  Press hard sauce through a pastry bag to form decorative shapes and
  decorate them with candied red cherry halves and green fruit peels.
  (If the mixture is too soft, place in refrigerator to stiffen.)

      Title: OUR LEMON PIE
 Categories: Diabetic, Desserts, Pies
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      3 tb Margarine;
     10    Graham cracker squares;
    1/2 c  Skimmed evaporated milk;
           -cold
      1 pk Dream Whip;
     27 pk Equal sweetener;
      2    Egg yolks;
      2 lg Lemons; 1/2 cup juice
      3    Egg whites;
      3 tb Sugar;
 
  Melt margarine on medium to low heat.  Roll graham crackers into
  crumbs with rolling pin.  Mix crumbs and melted margarine. Pat to
  make crust on bottom and sides of pie pan. Chill.
  
  Add cold evaporated milk to Dream Whip (do not add vanilla). Sprinkle
  in 24 pkg. Equal.  Mix and beat according to directions. Beat egg
  yolks slightly, and gradually stir in lemon juice. Gradually fold in
  the whipped Dream Whip.  Spread in pie crust.  Turn on broiler so it
  will get hot. Beat 3 egg whites frothy (use clean beaters so whites
  will beat up as fluffy as possible).  Add 1 tbs. sugar and beat until
  blended in. Add another tbs. sugar and 3 Equal pkg. and beat until
  soft peaks form. Spread meringue over top. Spread meringue to stick
  to the edges so it won't shrink when you broil it.
  
  Put under broiler for 30-60 seconds until meringue is lightly
  browned. IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG AT ALL AND IS EASY TO BURN. The flavors
  will blend better if you chill for 5 hours.

      Title: OUTLAW CHILE RELLENOS
 Categories: Southwest, Chile, Cheese
      Yield: 48 Servings
 
      8    Fresh anaheim chiles(may
           -usecanned
      2    Eggs
    1/2 ts Dried mexican oregano
      1 tb Powdered garlic
      1 tb Water
      4 c  Bread crumbs, fresh or
           -store bought
    1/4    Grated parmesan cheese
    1/4 lb Monterey jack or jalapeño
           -cheese, sliced 3/4 inch
           -thick
    1/2 c  Flour seasoned with a
           -little salt and pepper
 
  Chef Roberto Garcia: In my family we had no such laws governing the
  consumption or use of chiles, but perhaps we should have. My
  grandmother's remedy for a sty was to rub it with the tip of a fresh
  jalapeño pepper. Ouch! My brothers and I learned quickly to look down
  at our shoes while walking near our grandmother. The following recipe
  for chile rellenos is not hot, but it is very delicious and easy to
  prepare. However, don't get caught eating them in Cloud, California.
  You may be charged with "willful negligence," for eating chiles
  during a worship service. Just to be sure, you'd better check with
  your local municipality for any "unruly chile laws" in your
  community. If using fresh chiles, first blister them in the oven or
  use your favorite method. Remove the skins. Cut a small slit in the
  chile's base and scoop out the seeds with a tablespoon and discard
  them (canned chiles are already peeled and seeded). In a medium-sized
  mixing bowl, mix the eggs, oregano, garlic and water until
  well-blended. On a large plate or piece of wax paper, thoroughly mix
  the bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. Place the flour on a smaller
  plate or use a piece of wax paper. Butter or grease a cookie sheet.
  Put a stick of cheese into each chile. One at a time, dust each chile
  with flour, dip them into the egg batter, and place the chile on top
  of the bread crumbs. Pat the chiles with the bread crumbs, making
  sure the entire chile has been covered. Preheat the oven to 375
  degrees. Place the chiles on the greased cookie sheet. Drizzle the
  butter the chiles and bake for 20 minutes. Serve with rice and beans.

  on top of th loaf after the final rise.
  
  Tried this one yesterday, and not only was it good, it is GONE! I
  subbed applesauce for the fat with no problems. I've got a loaf
  working now, also subbing whole-wheat flour for part of the white and
  with 1/2 c sprouted wheat added.

      5 c  Bread cubes
      1 cn Onions, french fried
 
  Preheat oven to 325.  Remove crusts from bread, and cut into cubes.
  Beat eggs, milk, and seasonings with rotary beater. Stir in bread
  cubes, cheese and 1/2 can onions. (To make shrimp bake, stir in 2
  cups cleaned cooked shrimp.)  Pour into 11-1/2"x7-1/2"x1-1/2" greased
  baking dish. Top with remaining onions. Bake covered for 45 minutes,
  then uncover and bake another 15 minutes, until set. Serve
  immediately.
  
  Sylvia's comments: I used a can of french-fried onions instead of the
  chopped onion, mixed 1/2 into the cheese mixture and used 1/2 to top
  the casserole.  My cheese-crazy kids LOVED it. And I think you could
  add almost anything to it; it's a basic strata recipe, but the first
  one I've had come out well.

      Title: OVEN DRIED SUN DRIED TOMATOES
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Tomatoes (from 10 to 1000!)
           Salt (coarse is better)
           Vinegar
           Olive Oil
           Assorted herbs, optional
 
  Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Half or Quarter the tomatoes depending on
  size. Place them cut side up on baking sheets and salt them down. The
  salt is used mainly to expedite the drying process. Bake at 300 for
  four to eight hours--until 'maters are dried. Dip in vinegar, and
  pack in sterilized jars with Olive Oil. Add herbs if you wish
  (Oregano seems an obvious first choice, but others would be
  interesting). Refrigerate. Keeps for many many months. USES: In cold
  salads, tossed in pasta (hmmm...like a creme sauce with slivers of
  dried tomatoes...I'm getting hungry...), in omlettes, etc. etc.

      Title: OVEN FRIED FISH
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 c  Fat-free crackers processed
           -to fine crumbs (or fat free
           -bread crumbs)
    1/4 ts Dry mustard powder
      1    Egg white
      2 tb Non-fat milk
      1 lb Fish filets of choice
           -(orange roughy or other
           -mild white fish)
           Lemon wedges (optional)
 
  Preheat oen to 425.  Process crackers into fine crumbs using a food
  processor or blender.  Stir dry mustard into crumbs. Beat egg white
  with milk in a broad, shallow bowl. Spread cracker crumbs on a plate.
  
  Dip fish filets one at a time into egg white mixture, then place in
  cracker crumbs and turn to coat all surfaces. Bake 15 minutes, until
  coating is crisp and fish flakes easily with a fork.
  
  Serve with lemon wedges, if desired.
  
  The book reccomends making this with Health Valley Fat Free Herb
  crackers, but I just used the Premium fat free crackers that I
  already had. I think it would be better with the herb crackers
  because it was very bland with the plain crackers.  The fish had a
  nice "non-fishy" flavor though, which my hubby said was greatly
  improved with lemon pepper.

 Categories: Poultry, Cyberealm, Kooknet
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3 c  Self-rising flour
      1 tb Paprika
      2 pk Lipton Tomato Cup A Soup
           -powder
      2 pk Good Seasons Italian
           -Dressing mix powder
      1 ts Seasoned salt
           Pam or oil
    1/4 lb Margarine or Butter
      3 lb Fryer chicken
 
  In doubled plastic food bag combine well the flour, paprika, Lipton
  Tomato Cup A Soup powder, Good Seasons Italian Dressing mix powder
  and seasoned salt.
  
  Shake the mixture well to combine it in the bag, having twisted the
  end the bag tightly until the air inside the bag create an inflated
  balloon affect.
  
  Spray a jelly roll pan (10x15x3/4") with Pam or wipe it well with
  oil. Run a cut-up chicken fryer under cold water and let excess water
  drip off, or put all of the wet pieces of chicken into a colander to
  drain a few minutes.
  
  Dredge pieces in the flour mixture, by placing the pieces, one at a
  time, in the bag of seasoned flour and shaking it to coat each piece.
  Arrange the coated pieces, skin-side up on prepared pan. Melt
  margarine or butter and use a 1" wide soft bristled pastry brush (or
  one from a paint store with soft hair bristles -- rather than plastic
  bristles) and dab the melted margarine over the floured surface --
  skin-side only ~- of each piece of chicken.  When all of the melted
  margarine has been divided between chicken pieces, bake it uncovered
  ~- without turning the pieces -- 350 degrees F -- for 1 hour or till
  golden brown and tender.
  
  FOR CRISPY COATING:  After applying melted margarine, dust each piece
  with a few tablespoons more seasoned flour mixture and dab again in
  additional melted margarine before baking.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.

        4 TB Unsalted Butter
  :          Apple Cider Sabayon (Recipe
  :          Follows)
  
  Heat the oven to 250F.  Place the cut apples, 1 tbls. sugar, maple
  syrup, orange zest, lemon zest, lemon juice, bay leaves, vanilla
  bean, cinnamon, mace, nutmeg, and star anise ina medium mixing bowl.
  Toss the mixture well to combine. Melt te remaining 1/3 cup sugar in
  a 12 inch cast iron skillet over medium high heat until the sugar has
  caramelized, about 4 minutes. If the sugar starts to brown unevenly,
  stir occasionally, with a wooden spoon. Add the butter, and cook
  until melted. Reduce the heat to medium. Carefully placethe apple
  halves, cut side down, into the skillet, and pour the rest of the
  ingredients from the mixing bowl over the apples. Cook for 4 to 6
  minutes, until the apples begin to caramelize and the sauce starts to
  thicken slightly. Transfer the skillet to the oven, and bake for
  about 40 minutes. Remove the skillet from the oven and using a
  spatula or tongs, carefully turn the apples over. Bake 20 minutes
  more, until the apples are very tender. Se! rve immediately with
  Apple Cider Sabayon.
  
  Apple Cider Sabayon Makes 3 cups
  
  For best results, when setting sabayon over simmering water in step 2
  choose a bowl that just fits inside the pot.
  
      1/4    cup sugar 4 large egg yolks
      1/2    cup sparkling apple cider 2 tbls. Calvados, ( a french
  apple brandy- regular brandy can be substituted) 1/4 cup heavy cream
  (1/2 cup whipped)
  
  Fill a medium stockpot a quarter of the way full with water. Bring to
  a boil, then reduce heat and let simmer. Fill a large bowl with ice
  water; set aside. Combine sugar and egg yolks in bowl of an electric
  mixer fitted with paddle attachment, and beat until mixture is pale
  and has a thick consistency, about 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down sides
  of bowl with rubber spatula one time while beating. Add cider and
  Calvados,and beat for 2 more minutes Transfer the yolk mixture to a
  large metal bowk, and set over simmering water. Whisk together for 6
  to 8 minutes, until the sabayon thickens and is fluffy and slightly
  stiff. The sabayon should begin to look satiny and start sticking to
  the bowl slightly. The air bubles will become very fine, instead of
  large and loose. Set bowl in ice water bath. Continue whisking
  sabayon untl chilled, about 3 minutes. Whip the cream to medium stiff
  peaks, and fold into chilled sabayon. The sabayon can be stored in
  refrigerator for up to 24 hours.

      Title: OVEN-BAKED BEEF STEW
 Categories: Stews
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      4 lb Sirloin, cut in 1x2" cubes
      2 c  Pinot noir or other hearty
           -red wine
    1/2 lb Thickly sliced bacon, cut in
           -1/2" pieces
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 lg Onion, chopped
      2    Carrots, scraped and sliced
           -thin
    1/4 c  Butter
    1/4 c  All-purpose flour
      4 c  Chicken broth
      2 lg Garlic cloves, sliced thin
      2 ts Tomato paste
  1 1/2 ts Salt, or to taste
    1/2 ts Pepper, or to taste
 
  Pour the wine over the beef in a glass or ceramic bowl (metal will
  give the wine an "off" taste). Cover and refrigerate for 3 hours to
  marinate.
  
  Reserving the marinade, drain the beef. Dry on paper towels. Simmer
  the bacon for 10 minutes in enough water to cover. Drain and pat dry.
  (This rids the bacon of smokiness and some fat.) In a dutch oven,
  saute the bacon in olive oil over medium heat until crisp. Drain on
  paper towels. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the drippings.
  
  Working in small batches so the meat browns well, brown the beef
  cubes in the bacon drippings. With a slotted spoon, remove each batch
  to a bowl.
  
  Saute the onions and carrots in the drippings until wilted and
  beginning to brown, about 7 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to
  the bowl of meat.
  
  Heat 3 cups of broth in a saucepan. Pour out any drippings that
  remain in the Dutch oven. melt the butter over medium heat in the
  Dutch oven, then stir in the flour. Scrape the bottom of the pan with
  a wooden spatula to keep the mixture moving. When the paste is a dark
  golden brown, stir in the broth. Simmer a minute or two, then stir in
  the tomato paste, salt, pepper and garlic. Add the sauteed vegetables
  and meat. Stir in the reserved wine marinade.
  
  Quickly bring to a boil. Cover and bake in a preheated 325'F. oven
  about 2 hours. If the sauce gets too thick, thin it with the extra
  cup of broth.
  
  TO SERVE AFTER FREEZING: Thaw according to recommendations. Reheat in
  a covered casserole at 325'F. for about 20 minutes, or until bubbly.
  You might add freshly cooked vegetables (mushrooms, baby carrots,
  steamed potatoes). Serves 10.

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 lb Frozen hashed brown potatoes
    1/4 lb Butter
      1 pt Sour cream
      1 cn Mushroom soup
      8 oz Chedder cheese; shredded
      1    Onion; grated
    3/4 c  Milk* (optional)
 
  Cut butter into potatoes.  Mix rest of ingred. together; pour over
  top of potatoes.  Toss.  *1/4 - 3/4 c. milk can be used in place of
  one-half of the sour cream. It will make a moister casserole, if
  desired. Bake in a 13x9" pan @ 350 for 1/2 hr covered and an
  additional 1/2 hr. uncovered. I have used Cheddar Cheese soup, but
  reduce the butter as it will be greasy with both.  I also put
  additional shredded cheese on top during the second half hour of
  baking. Doubles well. Can be refrigerated overnight after mixing all
  together. TSPN00B-LISA CRAWLEY

      Title: OVERNIGHT WHOLE GRAIN CEREAL
 Categories: Digest, Mar95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Part mixed whole grains
           (e g. wheat berries, oats,
           Buckwheat, hulled barley,
           Rye, millet, etc.)
      3    Parts water
    1/3    Part raisins (optional)
 
  Boil water Add grains [and raisins, if using them] Stir Bring to boil
  again Turn off heat Cover pot Leave overnight as is [or in a warm
  oven]
  
  (NOTE: I usually add raisins to already cooked cereal because I like
  the texture. They turn out differently if they are added in the
  cooking stage. They plump up and are really soft, which is nice
  sometimes. I guess other types of dried fruit might work too.)
  
  You can reheat this in the morning or eat it at room temp. Suggested
  toppings included any of the following:
  
  milk-type stuff molasses fruit sesame salt maple syrup
  
  One variation the cookbook suggests is toasting and then grinding the
  grains in a hand grinder before cooking. Apparently, this makes the
  grains more nutty tasting.

  This came from _New Recipes for Young Vegetarians_ by Sammy Green
  Lentils take about one hour to cook from dry, but they freeze well,
  so make a big bunch of them at once. This recipe came out kind of
  crumbly, but that might have been a fluke, as this was the first time
  I'd made it. :)

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Cooked hominy
      2 tb Butter
      2    Eggs
      1 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Cornmeal
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  Hominy gives this bread it's distinctive flavor. Like all spoon
  breads, it should be eaten very hot with plenty of butter. Do try
  this one it will change your mind about grits.
  
  This recipe orignally appeared in The Carolina Housewife. The last
  line in the recipe is taken verbatim from the orignal by the authors.
  
  While hominy is hot, stir in the butter. Beat eggs until light and
  add to hominy, then add milk. Stir in cornmeal and salt. This makes a
  very thin batter. Pour into a deep, buttered pan and bake in a 375
  degree F. oven for about 30 minutes (about 1 hour in a glass baking
  dish). This will serve 6.
  
  When baked, it has the appearance of a baked batter pudding, and when
  rich and well mixed it has almost the delicacy of baked custard.

  Process 15 to 20 seconds, or until fine crumbs form. In small bowl,
  sprinkle yeast and sugar over warm water; stir until dissolved. While
  processor is running, pour yeast mixture through feed tube in a
  steady stream. Process until mixture forms a ball; continue
  processing for 2 minutes. Carefully turn out dough onto lightly
  floured surface.  With floured, rolling pin, roll out dough as thin
  as possible into a rectangle. Fold each long side to center; then
  fold each end to center to form a smaller rectangle. Repeat rolling
  and folding twice more, adding flour to surface as necessary to keep
  dough from sticking. Roll out dough into an 8 x 6' rectangle. Cut
  rectangle into 48 (1") squares. Place squares 1" apart, on greased
  large baking sheet. With fork, prick each square once. Bake in 375
  oven 20 to 25 minutes or until lightly browned. Immediately remove
  from baking sheet. Cool on racks. Store in airtight container up to 1

  4 1/2 c  Bread crumbs, very dry
           -divided
      4 tb Butter, sweet

MMMMM-----------------------SEASONING MIX----------------------------
      2 ts Salt
      2 ts Garlic powder
      2 ts Cayenne pepper
      2 ts Sweet paprika
      2 ts Black pepper
      1 ts Onion powder
      1 ts Dried oregano leaves
      1 ts Dried thyme leaves
 
  Combine the oysters, oyster liquor, and water; stir and refrigerate at
  least 1 hour.  Strain and reserve the oysters and 4 cups of the oyster
  water separately; refrigerate again until ready to use
  
  In a medium size bowl, combine the seasoning mix ingredients; mix
  well. Set aside.
  
  Place 1 stick plus 2 Tablespoosn of the margarine in a heavy 8-quart
  saucepan or large Dutch oven over high heat. When margarine is half
  melted, add 3 cups of the onions, 2 cups of the celery, and 2 cups of
  the bell peppers; saute until onions are well browned, about 30
  minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in 3 tablespoons of the
  seasoning mix and the garlic. Reduce heat to low and cook about 4
  minutes, stirring and scraping pan bottom occasionally.  Add the
  remaining 2 sticks of margarine, 3 cups onions, 2 cups celery and 2
  cups bell peppers, 1 cup of the green onions, 1 cup of the parsley,
  and the bay leaves. Turn heat to high, stirring until margarine is
  melted; cook until vegetables are tender but still a little crunchy,
  about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  
  Now stir in the reserved 4 cups oyster water and cook about 15
  minutes, stirring occasionally.  Stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon
  plus 1 teaspoon seasoning mix and enough bread crumbs (start with 4
  cups, but you may need a little more) to make a fairly moist but not
  runny dressing. Remove from heat.
  
  Drain oysters well and stir them into the dressing. Spoon dressing
  into an ungreased 15x11-inch baking pan (preferably not a non-stick
  type) and bake uncovered in a 350 F oven until well browned, about 1
  hour, stirring only after a dark crust builds (30 to 45 minutes).
  Then remove from oven and stir thoroughly but gently so oysters won't
  break apart, scraping browned parts from pan bottom and sides into
  the mixture. Discard bay leaves.
  
  Add the butter and the remaining 1 cup green onions and 1 cup parsley,
  stirring well.  Serve as desired.
  
  NOTE: Be certain to let the dressing cool, then refrigerate it and
  chill it well before using it to stuff fowl.

 Categories: Main dish, Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    French Bread, 12" Long
    1/3 c  Melted Butter
      1 pt Shucked Oysters, Drained
           Tabasco Sauce
           Hot Heavy Cream (Optional)
 
  Preheat oven to 425 øF. Cut off the top of the bread lengthwise,
  scoop out most of the bread of the bottom half, leaving a shell about
  3/4" thick. Brush the inside of the bottom and the cut side of the
  top with melted butter. Put the loaf and "lid," cut sides up, on an
  ungreased baking sheet, bake until toasted golden brown, about 20
  minutes (the lid will be done first; check that it does not
  overcook). Meanwhile, saut the oysters in hot butter until plump.
  Add salt, pepper, a dash of Tabasco, and, if desired, a little hot
  cream.  Fill the loaf with the hot fried oysters and put the lid on
  top. Heat for 10 minutes or until ready to serve. Cut in thick slices
  if the loaf is long. NOTE: Individual rolls can also be used: allow
  about 3 oysters for each one. The amount of oysters required for this
  recipe varies according to the size of the oysters and the size of
  the loaf of bread.  In any case, the bread "basket" should be filled
  to the top with oysters.

 Categories: Appetizers, Sauces
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     24    Raw oysters - in shell

MMMMM----------------------CHAMPAGNE SAUCE---------------------------
  1 1/2 tb Unsalted butter
  1 1/2 tb Flour
    1/2 c  Oyster juice - from above
    1/2 c  Champagne - or other dry
           -sparkling wine
    1/4 ts Celery seed - ground
           Freshly ground white pepper
      2 c  Rock salt - or coarse salt
           -for the broiler pan
 
  * 2 cups rock salt - or coarse salt for the broiler pan
  
  *DIRECTIONS*
  
  PREPARATION: Open the oysters as instructed in previous recipe
  ("Opening Oysters in the Microwave"). Measure 1/2 cup of the strained
  cooking liquid and reserve.
  
  CHAMPAGNE SAUCE: Melt the butter in a 1-quart glass or ceramic
  measure or bowl, uncovered, on high for 2 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup
  reserved oyster juices and Champagne and cook, uncovered, on high,
  stirring twice during cooking, for 4 minutes or until thickened.
  Recipe can be made to this point a few hours ahead.
  
  COOKING AND SERVING: Heat the broiler with rack set at its highest
  level. Stir celery seed and white pepper to taste into the sauce.
  Spread 2 cups of coarse or rock salt in the bottom of a broiler pan
  to steady oysters. Nestle reserved shells into salt.  Put each oyster
  in a shell and thoroughly coat the tops with sauce. Put under
  preheated broiler until just golden, about 2 minutes.
  
  Makes 4 first-course servings.
  
  NOTE:  This is a simple and elegant classic.  You can prepare the
  oysters and sauce ahead in the microwave, and then broil for a minute
  or two just before serving. The obvious wine to serve is Champagne.
  If you choose another dry sparkling wine to drink instead, use the
  same one in the sauce.

  mixture from pan and add cooking liquid from spinach. Open oysters
  (be sure to keep the 1/2 shell you will not be using near to 1/2
  shell containing oyster) draining liquid into pan also. Add thyme and
  boil over medium heat until reduced to about 1/4 cup. Add cream and
  hazelnut liqueur; continue cooking until mixture is thickened and
  reduced a bit. Season to taste with white pepper. In a medium mixing
  bowl, combine spinach with bacon mixture and cream sauce. Stir until
  thoroughly combined. Top each oyster with 1-2 tablespoons of spinach
  mixture. Sprinkle with swiss cheese and half as much asiago cheese.
  Roll puff pastry accordingly. Using the 1/2 shell as a template, set
  on top of pastry and cut out, then lift the piece of pastry and put
  on top of corresponding oyster. Continue doing this until all oysters
  are topped with pastry, discard unneeded 1/2 shells. Beat egg with 1
  tablespoon of water and with a pastry brush, brush tops of each
  oyster. Place oysters on a baking sheet and bake in a 400-degree oven
  for 30-40 minutes or until pastry is a dark golden brown. Serve

  ~-----  VARIATION: 4 to 5 lb ROCK SALT
       Note:  FRESH, SHUCKED OYSTERS (RINSED AND DRAINED, MAKE SURE ALL
       *****  SHELL PARTICLES ARE REMOVED)
       To cook: Oysters are best baked using oyster shells, rock salt,
       and pie pans to keep oysters hot when served. If shells and salt
       are not available, use a jelly roll pan.
       Spread rock salt to cover the bottoms of four 6-inch pie pans.
       Place 6 oyster shells in each pan on top of rock salt. Place 1
       oyster in each shell. If using jelly roll pan, spread oysters
       should look a little dry. Remove from oven. Immediately cover
       each oyster completely with lots of sauce (about
        3    tablespoons
       sauce per oyster). Bake in a 400 F oven for 15 to
       20    minutes
       until tops are brownish.
       To serve: If using pie pans, place pan salt, and oysters on
       heat-proof dinner dishes and serve immediately. Eat oysters and
       sauce out of shell with a fork. If not using pie pans, place 6
       oysters with sauce on each hot serving dish. Yields 24 oysters.

 Categories: Cookies, Snacks
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 c  Old-fashioned rolled oats
           -(not quick-cooking)
      1 c  All-purpose flour
      2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Salt (if peanut butter is
           -unsalted)
    1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 c  Unsalted butter, at room
           -temperature (2 sticks)
      1 c  Peanut butter, chunky or
           -smooth
      1 c  Firmly packed light-brown
           -sugar
      1 c  Granulated sugar
      2    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla
  1 1/2 c  Semisweet chocolate chips OR
           -raisins
 
  Preheat the oven to moderate (350F)
  
  Stir together the oats, flour, cinnamon, salt (if using), nutmeg, and
  baking soda in a large bowl.  Beat together the butter,peanut butter,
  and the brown and white sugars in a large bowl at medium speed until
  light and fluffy, about 4 minutes.  Add the eggs, one at a time,
  beating for 1 minute after each addition. Beat in the vanilla.
  
  Beat in the oat mixture on the lowest mixer speed just until blended.
  Stir in the chips or raisins by hand. The dough can be refrigerated,
  covered, for up to 24 hours, or used immediately.
  
  If using unchilled dough, drop onto ungreased baking sheets without
  rolling and do not flatten.  Scoop chilled dough by rounded
  tablespoons, roll into balls between palms, and place on greased
  baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart.  Flatten to 1/2-inch thickness
  with palm of hand.
  
  Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until golden and just firm around the
  edges. Cool on the baking sheets for 2 minutes. Drizzle with melted
  dark and white chocolate, if you wish.  Transfer to racks to cool
  completely. Store airtight for up to 3 days.

      Title: PA-PAO-FAN (EIGHT TREASURE RICE PUDDING)
 Categories: Chinese, Pudding
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 c  Glutinous rice
    1/4 c  Lard
    1/2 lb Pitted dates; finely chopped
      8    Whole dates; cut in half
      1 c  Canned red bean paste
     20    Dried jujubes
      2 tb Sugar
      2 tb Melted lard
           Red & green candied cherries

MMMMM---------------------------SYRUP--------------------------------
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 c  ;cold water
      1 ts Almond extract
      1 tb Cornstarch; dissolve in
      3 tb ;cold water
 
  "This dessert is known as eight-treasure or eight-precious or even
  eight-jewel pudding because in China the design on the top of it was
  made with 8 different kinds of dried and candied fruits or nuts --
  such as dried lotus seeds, candied green or red plums, seeded
  dragon's eye nuts, watermelon seeds, preserved dates, dried jujubes,
  candied orange peel, candied red or green cherries, and blanched
  walnuts. The version described here is simply decorated with pitted
  dates, dried jujubes and candied cherries."
  
  Prepare ahead: 1. In a large bowl, cover the rice with cold water and
  soak for 2 hours.
  
  2. In a 12-inch wok or 10-inch skillet, melt the 1/4 cup lard over
  moderate heat. Add the chopped dates and red-bean paste, and cook
  over low heat, stirring frequently, for 20 minutes, or until the
  mixture begins to come away from the sides of the pan. emove from the
  pan to a small bowl and cool to room temperature.
  
  3. Combine the jujubes and 2 cups cold water in a 2-quart saucepan.
  Over high heat, bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to
  low and simmer the jujubes, covered, for about 10 minutes. Drain the
  jujubes through a sieve, and, when they are cool enough to handle,
  cut them in half and remove and discard the pits.
  
  4. Have the rice, date and bean-paste mixture, jujubes, cherries,
  sugar, water, almond extract and cornstarch all within easy reach.
  
  To cook: 5. Pour enough boiling water into the lower part of a
  steamer to come within an inch of the cooking rack (or use a steamer
  substitute). Line the rack with a double layer of paper towels. Drain
  the rice and spread it evenly over the lined rack. Over high heat,
  bring the water in the steamer to a rolling boil, cover the pan
  tightly and steam the rice for 30 minutes, or until the rice is
  thoroughly cooked, replenishing the water if it boils away.
  
  6. Transfer the rice to a bowl, and stir into it the 2 tablespoons of
  sugar and 2 tablespoons of melted lard. Spoon half the rice into a
  shallow heat-proof bowl (about 6 inches across and 3 inches deep). On
  top, place the red-bean-paste mixture, spreading it to within 1/2
  inch of the sides of the bowl. Place the remaining rice over it,
  spreading it out evenly to the edges of the bowl and pressing down on
  it lightly with the palm of your hand. Put an inverted dinner plate
  over the top of the bowl, and, grasping the edges of both the plate
  and the bowl, turn them over together. Lift the bowl up gently to
  unmold the pudding.
  
  7. Now decorate the sides and top of the pudding with the jujubes,
  halved dates and candied cherries. Any sort of design you devise
  would be proper. For instance, the bottom edge of the pudding may be
  decorated with a row of date halves spaced about an inch apart, the
  top edge rimmed with jujubes, laid side by side, and the top of the
  pudding ornamented with flowers and leaves made of cherries.
  
  8. When the decoration is complete, gently spread a long piece of
  plastic wrap over it to hold the fruit in place, invert the bowl
  again and carefully set it over the top of the pudding. Grasping the
  edges of the bowl and plate together, turn the bowl over and remove
  the plate. Bring the water in the steamer to a boil again, place the
  bowl on the rack and cover the pan tightly. Steam the pudding for an
  hour, replenishing the water when it boils away. Have a kettle of
  boiling water handy.
  
  To Serve: 9. A few minutes before the pudding is done, make the syrup
  by combining the 1/4 cup of sugar with the cup of water in a small
  saucepan and boiling it until the sugar dissolves. Add the almond
  extract, give the cornstarch mixture a quick stir to recombine it and
  sitr it into the syrup. Cook, stirring, for a few seconds until the
  syrup thickens slightly and becomes clear. Now remove the pudding
  from the steamer and place a circular serving plate over it. Grasping
  bowl and plate securely, turn them over. The pudding should slide out
  easily. Carefully peel off the plastic wrap. Pour the hot syrup over
  the pudding and serve at once.

 Categories: Oriental, Curry, Fish, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
 10 1/2 oz Grated Coconut (unsweetened)
  2 1/4 lb Catfish fillet.
      3 tb Finely sliced lemongrass.
      1 tb Galanga, sliced thin.
      1 tb Kaffir lime rind, sliced.
      2 tb Cillantro roots.
      2 tb Krachai, finely sliced.
     20    Fresh very hot Thai chilli.
     20    Peppercorns
    1/2 ts Salt.
      4    Onions, medium size.
      8    Cloves of garlics.
      9    Dry red chilli, remove seeds
    1/2 ts Coliander seeds.
    1/2 ts Cumin.
      3    Mace.
      2    Cardamom
    1/2 ts Nutmeg.
      4    Kaffir lime leaves.
 
  1. Use the grated coconut to make 1-1/4 cups of coconut milk, by
  adding 1/2 cup of very hot water, and working the mixture thouroughly
  and squeezing out the coconut milk. You may also substitute an
  equivalent amount of canned (unsweetened) coconut milk.
  2. Cut the catfish fillet into medium size cubes (about 2" x 2").
  3. Discard seeds from the dry chilli, and soak in cold water for at
  least a half hour.
  4. Separate about 1/2 cup of "cream" from the coconut milk, and heat
  in a frying pan. Fry the catfish pieces in the coconut "cream" till
  just cooked and put aside.
  5. Put the following ingredients in a motar: salt, peppercorns, cumin,
  coriander seeds, mace, cardamon, nutmeg. Pound till well mixed into a
  fine pulp. Drain the dried chilli (discarding the water) and add to
  the paste in motar. Continue pounding till the chilli pieces are
  mixed in. Add lemongrass, galanga, kaffir lime rind, cillantro roots,
  krachai, and fresh Thai chilli. Continue pounding until it's a fine
  well mixed paste. (NOTE: You may substitute with an equivalent amount
  of premade Thai "Red Curry Paste"). 6. Take the above curry paste
  with the remaining coconutmilk, and fry over high heat till boiling.
  Lower heat to medium and continue frying, with stiring, till oil
  starts to form on top of the mixture. Add the cooked fish pieces and
  the coconut "cream" mixture. Lower the heat to low, and gently cook
  till thouroughly heated. Adjust tastes with fish sauce and a little
  sugar (just to have a very slight sweet taste). Add several kaffir
  lime leaves and cooked for a little while longer.
  7. Remove to a serving platter and garnish with slices of fresh red
  chilli peppers. Serve with plain boiled white rice.

      Title: PAD THAI (5)
 Categories: Thai
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Dried rice noodles 1/8" wide
           -Warm Water
    1/2 lb Shrimp, chicken or pork
           -OR- a combination
    1/4 c  Fish sauce
    1/4 c  Granulated sugar; plus:
      2 tb Granulated sugar
    1/4 c  White vinegar; plus:
      2 tb White vinegar
      1 ts Paprika
      4    Green onions
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
           - (more if needed)
      1 ts Chopped garlic
      2    Eggs
    3/4 lb Bean sprouts
           Ground roasted chiles
           - (see note at end)
           Unsalted roasted peanuts
           - ground
           Lime wedges
 
  1.  Soak noodles for 20-25 minutes in enough warm water to cover
  them. They should be flexible and soft, but not so soft that they can
  be mashed easily with the fingers. Later cooking in liquid will
  soften them more. Drain them throughly in a colander while preparing
  the other ingredients. Traditionally they are left in full-length
  strands, but you may cut them into 8 inch lengths if you find it
  easier to stir-fry then that way.
  
  2.  Peel and devein the shrimp leaving the tails intact(or remove if
  preferred) Slice chicken, pork into 1/8 inch strips 1-2 inches long.
  
  3.  Mix the fish sauce, sugar, vinegar, and paprika in a bowl and stir
  until the sugar dissolves.  Set aside. Slice green onions both the
  green and white parts, diagonally into 1-1/2 inch long pieces. Set
  aside.
  
  4.  Heat a wok, add the oil and swirl over the surface. Add the
  garlic and stir fry until light golden. Add the meat and stir-fry
  until shrimp is pink.  If using chicken or pork stir-fry until pink
  disappears. Add the noodles and toss lightly to coat with oil and the
  distribute meat and garlic( I often do this in a larger pot since
  things tend to come out of the wok).
  
  5.  Add the liquid from step 3 and bring it to a boil rapidly, gently
  folding the noodles without breaking them. Reduce heat to medium and
  boil the mixture, folding frequently until the noodles have absorbed
  the liquid (I find a pasta server works great for this step).
  
  6.  Lift the noodles gently from one side of the wok. Pour a little
  oil along the side of the wok, then break the egg ad slip it into the
  oil. Break the yolk and cover the egg with the noodles immediately.
  Repeat this on the opposite side with the other egg.  Allow eggs to
  cook undisturbed, over moderate heat until they are set and almost
  dry. Additional oil may by added if the eggs or the noodles begin to
  stick to the wok.
  
  7.  When the eggs are set and almost dry, fold them gently but
  rapidly into the noodles.  Try not to break the noodles, which will
  be soft and fragile at this point. An effective way is to insert the
  scoop under the eggs, lift it through, and fold the mixtureover.
  Continue the lifting and folding motion until the eggs are broken up
  and well distributed.
  
  8.  Add the green onions (and bean sprouts if you prefer them mixed
  in) and toss the entire mixture quickly and gently, stll avoiding
  breaking the noodles.  Cook for about 2 minutes or until onions are
  tender.
  
  9.  Take a large platter spread with bean sprouts(if you left them out
  above).  Spread Pud Thai from wok over top. Sprinkle ground
  chilies(see note) and ground peanuts over the top and squeeze lime
  over the top. Or serve toppings seperatly for each diner to add
  according to taste.
  
  Note on chilies: Buy whole dried chiles and grind since pre-ground
  often lack the "bite" of whole ones. Thai chilies may be used (_VERY_
  hot), or milder American chiles may be used. The Thai chilies are
  know as Prig hang. They may also be found in Mexican food sections
  under the name "Chiles Arbol".  Use sparing if you aren't used to
  them they are quite potent.

    1/4 c  Thai Fish Sauce
    1/4 c  White Vinegar
      2 tb White sugar
      3 tb Paprika
 
  Soak the rice noodles in cold water at least two hours before cooking.
  Drain.
  
  In a large wok, heat oil and stir-fry garlic for 30 seconds. Add
  shrimp and other meat if used.
  
  Add the noodles, and stir-fry until al dente.  Add sauce ingredients,
  cook to allow most of this to be absorbed (2 minutes or so).
  
  Spread the noodles, etc.  out to the sides, and add eggs. Some will
  crack the eggs directly into the wok, others will pre-scramble. If
  cracked into the pan, start stirring them up when partially cooked,
  so you get 'streaky' yellow and white eggs.  As they cook, fold the
  noodle mixture back in.
  
  Add 1/2 the bean sprouts, peanuts, red pepper, folded into the
  mixture.
  
  Serve hot, garnished with the rest of the bean sprouts, chopped
  cabbage, cilantro.  Serve with lime wedges to be squeezed into the
  noodles.
  
  In my house, we have doctored this with thai hot chile sauce, sweet
  and sour sauce, or sate-style peanut sauce. It takes to any of these
  very well, depending on your tastes.

      Title: PAD THAI -- GENERAL NOTES
 Categories: Info/tips, Thai
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Information:
 
  Rice Noodles: ============= You can use fresh or dried, in widths
  from 1/8 to 1/2 inch wide.  I've never tried fresh. The dried ones
  have to be soaked in water to soften them. The recipes call for
  soaking in cold water, lukewarm water, hot water, and boiling water
  for anywhere from 7 minutes to 2 hours.  I put mine into warm tap
  water and let them soak while I'm preparing everything else. Just
  before I start cooking, I dump them into a colander to drain.  One
  recipe suggests cellophane noodles as an alternative to rice noodles
  -- I've never tried that variation.
  
  Meat or No Meat: ================ The most common meat called for is
  shrimp, with chicken and/or pork use in addition to or in place of the
  shrimp.  Some recipes add bean curd; some substitute it for the meat.
  Jeff Smith's recipe uses deep fried bean curd. My own variation is to
  substitute various veggies (asparagus, red bell pepper, broccoli,
  snow peas, or whatever else looks good.) As Nancie McDermott says,
  "Thai cooks blithely tinker with the classic formula to create
  signature variations, and you can, too."
  
  Oil and Seasonings: =================== Cooking pad thai starts with
  vegetable or peanut oil.  Most versions add garlic, and sometimes
  shallots, shrimp paste (be prepared for the smell!), onions, fresh
  red chilies, and/or preserved sweet white radish.
  
  The Sauce: ========== What makes pad thai, in addition to the rice
  noodles, is the sauce.  The general mix of flavors is sweet, salty,
  sour, and hot. Typical ingredients are:
  
  ~~ fish sauce (sometimes soy sauce is used in addition, or in place
  of for pure vegetarian versions) ~~ sugar (sometimes palm sugar is
  suggested) ~~ vinegar (various kinds specified; tamarind sauce or
  lime juice are sometimes used instead) ~~ "red stuff" ~- may be
  paprika, tomato paste, catsup, chili powder, hot chili sauce, chili
  paste with garlic, tomato sauce, or cayenne pepper, depending on the
  recipe. ~~ Other possible additions: salt, black pepper, chicken
  stock, dried shrimp powder. One recipe calls for boiling the sauce
  before using.
  
  Eggs: ===== Anywhere from 0-6. Some recipes call for beating the eggs
  before adding; others suggested breaking the yolk after adding the
  egg to the pan. Various techniques are suggested for manipulating the
  egg while cooking.  One recipe calls for cooking the egg before
  starting the pad thai, cutting it into strips, and then adding the
  egg strips back at the end of cooking. I haven't tried this myself
  but have had it in restaurants.
  
  Bean Sprouts and Scallions: ========================== These are
  usually added last in cooking, or added to the finished dish without
  cooking.
  
  Garnishes: ========= Various things can be added to finished dish as
  an edible garnish:
  
  ~~ lime or lemon wedges ~~ ground roasted chilies ~~ ground roasted
  peanuts ~~ dried red chili flakes ~~ fresh coriander leaves ~~
  cucumber slices ~~ dried shrimps ~~ fried basil leaves ~~ cherry
  tomatoes ~~ mint sprigs
  
  Experiment, and enjoy!

      Title: PAD THAI PSEUDO-VEGETARIAN STYLE
 Categories: Thai, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Thai fish sauce
    1/4 c  White vinegar; plus:
      2 tb White vinegar
      4 tb Sugar (less if desired)
      1 ts Paprika
      8 oz Thai rice noodles
           -- (about 1/4" thick)
      8 oz Tofu
      2 tb Dried shrimp (optional)
      3 tb Oil
      2    Garlic cloves (or more)
      2    Eggs
    3/4 lb Bean sprouts
      3    Green onions
           - sliced on the diagonal,
           - including white part
    3/4 c  Ground peanuts
      1 tb Roasted red chili peppers *
 
  * [Take some dried red chili peppers and cook them in an ungreased
  wok over low stirring constantly until they start to brown. Grind in
  a coffee grinder or spice mill.]
  
  Instructions: ============= Combine first four ingredients and let sit
  until sugar dissolves.  Soak rice noodles/sticks in warm water until
  they are soft but don't disintegrate when pressed, about 40 minutes.
  Drain. Drain tofu by wrapping it in a clean towel and pressing with a
  large can of tomatoes, about 30 minutes. Cut into 1/4 inch cubes.
  Rinse dried shrimp in water and drain.
  
  Put oil in wok, heat to medium, put in crushed garlic. Swirl around
  for about a minute.  Add noodles and mix around for a minute or two.
  
  Add the tofu and shrimp then immediately add the liquid. Keep stirring
  until the liquid has all been absorbed into the noodles, about a
  couple of minutes.
  
  Lower heat to low or medium-low.  Push some of the stuff aside at one
  end of wok, and break an egg in. Immediately cover with noodles. Do
  the same at the other end of wok. Let the eggs cook *undisturbed*
  until the yolks are practically cooked, about three minutes.
  (*Carefully* peak if unsure.) Slip a slotted spoon under each egg in
  turn, and bring upward, through the noodles, shaking as you go.  The
  idea is to break up the cooked egg into the rest of the mixture into
  tiny bits.
  
  Mix in sprouts and green onions.  Let cook for another two minutes.
  Turn off heat.  Add crushed peanuts and enough roasted red chilies to
  your desired hotness.

      1    To 2 tablespoons distilled
           -vinegar
      2 tb Sugar
      3    Eggs
      2 tb Chopped preserved radish,
           -soaked in warm water for
     10    Minutes, drained (optional)
      1 tb Small dried shrimp
           -(optional)
      1    Inch cubes fried tofu, cut
           -into 1/2-inch slices
           -(optional)
           Big pinch chile flakes
      2    Handfuls bean sprouts,
           -tailed
      2    To 4 tablespoons chicken
           -broth or water, as needed
      4    Green onions, trimmed, cut
           -into 2-inch lengths
           GARNISHES:
      2 tb Coarsely chopped roasted
           -peanuts
           Chile flakes
      2 tb Coarsely chopped fresh
           -coriander leaves
      2    Limes, cut into wedges
 
  Place noodles in a bowl and cover with warm water; let soak about 15
  minutes, or until soft and pliable. Drain; set aside.
  
  Set a wok over medium-high heat. When hot, add 2 tablespoons of the
  oil. Add shrimp and chicken; stir-fry until shrimp turns bright
  orange and chicken turns white, about 30 seconds. Set aside.
  
  Reheat wok over medium heat. Add the remaining oil and the garlic;
  brown gently (about 20 seconds). Increase heat to medium- high. Add
  the bean sauce, tomato paste, fish sauce, vinegar and sugar; stir
  until sugar dissolves.
  
  Increase heat to high. Break 1 of the eggs into the sauce; beat 3 or 4
  times. Let cook until egg is slightly set but still moist, about 20
  seconds. Repeat with second and third egg. There should be tiny
  flecks of egg peeking through.
  
  Add the optional radish, dried shrimp and tofu, the chile flakes,
  softened noodles and 1 handful of bean sprouts to the hot wok. Toss
  and lift noodles until tender and no longer stiff, about 3 or 4
  minutes.
  
  Add the chicken broth 2 tablespoons at a time if noodles seem dry, the
  green onions and the reserved shrimp/chicken mixture; toss for 30
  seconds to reheat. The sauce is not a wet sauce; it should "dry-coat"
  the noodles.
  
  Transfer to a platter and serve with a sprinkling of chopped peanuts,
  chile flakes to taste and fresh coriander leaves. Arrange. remaining
  bean sprouts and lime wedges around noodles. (Squeeze lime over
  noodles before eating.) Serve warm or at room temperature.
  
  Note: Traditionally, Pad Thai uses dried, flat Y4-inch-wide
  fettuccine-like rice-flour noodles, labeled "Chantaboon rice sticks."

      Title: PAD THAI WITH SHRIMP
 Categories: Thai
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      8 oz Small size rice noodles
      3 tb Tomato sauce
           -OR- tamarind paste
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 tb Pickled radish
      3 tb Sugar
    1/3 c  Water or chicken stock
      1    Egg
      3 tb Fish sauce
    1/2 lb Shrimp, cleaned and shelled
      1    Handful bean sprouts (fresh)
           -- chopped once or twice
      2 oz Green onions
           -- cut into 1/2 inch pieces
      2 tb Finely chopped peanuts
 
  1.  Soak the rice noodles in cold tap water about 20 minutes, until
  they are "springy".  Then drain in a colander until needed.
  
  2.  If using dried tamarind, soak the tamarind in hot water for
  awhile, then mash with a fork to soften. Force as much of the mixture
  as you can through a seive to remove bits of bark, etc.
  
  3.  Heat oil in wok, and add the tamarind/tomato sauce, picked
  radish, and sugar.  Mix well and let heat up.
  
  4.  Add the noodles, small portions at a time, and and that
  water/stock. Mix well until all the noodles are coated with the
  mixture. Add more liquid if necessary ~- it will cook out. Don't be
  easy on the noodles ~- chop them with the spatula or spoon some to
  separate them. It may help to "toss" the noodles like a salad, to get
  them coated.
  
  5.  Beat the egg and mix with the noodles.  Add the fish sauce and
  shrimp. Mix everything thoroughly.  The noodles will tend to "clump",
  so stir or "toss" like a salad to get everything mixed, and to ensure
  that the egg and shrimp cook thoroughly.  It will help to cover the
  wok with a lid for a minute or so, then toss the mixture, then cover
  again. You'll know it's done when the shrimp are completely pink.
  There may be a little browning of the noodles; stirring will keep
  them from burning.
  
  6.  Add the bean sprouts, green onions, and chopped peanuts. Mix
  well, then turn off the heat and let stand a minute or so. Serve.

      Title: PAD THAI.
 Categories: Main dish, Thai
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Dried Rice Noodles (1/8" w).
    1/2 lb Shrimp, chicken, or pork. *
    1/4 c  Fish Sauce.
      6 tb Sugar.
      6 tb White Vinegar.
      1 tb Tomato Paste.
      4    Scallions.
    1/2 c  Vegetable Oil (Approx.).
      2    Cloves Garlic, chopped fine
      2    Eggs.
    1/4 lb Bean Sprouts.
      2 tb Ground Roasted Chilies.
    1/4 c  Ground Roasted Peanuts.
           Lime Wedges.
 
  * The meat used may be either fresh shrimps, chicken, pork, or
  combinations.  The traditional uses dried shrimps and hard tofu pieces
  rather than fresh meat.
  
  Soak the noodles for 20 to 25 minutes in enough warm water to cover.
  They should be soft, but not so soft that they can be mashed easily
  with the fingers. Later cooking will soften them more. Drain the
  noodles thoroughly in a colander while preparing the other
  ingredients. Traditionally, they are left in full length strands, but
  you may cut them into shorter lengths (about 8-9 inches, say) to
  facilitate easier stir frying. Peel and devein the shrimps, leaving
  the tails intact, OR slice the chicken/pork across the grain into
  strips not more than 1/8 inch thick and 1-2 inches long. Mix the fish
  sauce, sugar, vinegar, and tomato paste in a bowl. Stir until the
  sugar is dissolved.  Set the mixture aside. Slice the scallions, both
  white and green parts, diagonally into pieces 1-1/2 inches long. Set
  aside. Heat a wok, and add the vegetable oil to the hot wok. Swirl
  the oil to coat the surface of the wok.  Add garlic and fry till
  golden. Add shrimp and fry till they turn pink, or if chicken/pork is
  used, fry till the pink color disappears completely.  Add the noodles
  and toss lightly to coat them with oil and to distribute the garlic
  and meat. Add the liquid mixed earlier and bring to a boil rapidly,
  gently folding the noodle, being careful not to break them.  Reduce
  the heat to medium and boil the mixture, folding frequently, until
  the noodles have absorbed the liquid. Using a wok scoop, or a stiff
  spatula, lift the noodles gently from one side of the wok. Pour a
  little oil along the side of the wok, then break one egg and slip it
  into the oil.  Break the yolk, and cover the egg with the noodles
  immediately. Repeat this on the opposite side of the wok with the
  remaining egg. Allow the eggs to cook undisturbed, over moderate
  heat, until they are set and almost dry.  Additional oil may be added
  if the eggs or the noodles begin to stick to the wok. When the eggs
  are set and almost dry, fold them gently but rapidly into the
  noodles.  Try not to break the noodles, which will be soft and
  fragile at this point. An effective way is to insert the scoop under
  the eggs, lift it through, and fold the mixture over. Continue the
  lifting and folding motion until the eggs are broken up and well
  distributed. Add the bean sprouts and sliced scallions, and toss the
  mixture quickly and gently, still avoiding breaking the noodles. Cook
  for about 2 minutes, or until the bean sprouts and scallions are
  crisp-tender. Place the mixture on a large, warm serving platter.
  Sprinkle ground chilies and peanuts over the top, and squeeze lime
  juice over that. Alternately, these garnishes may be served on the
  side for each diner to add according to tastes. NOTES: 1. Pad Thai is
  traditionally served accompanied with fresh vegetables, in particular
  whole scallion, a small pile of fresh raw bean sprouts (to be mixed
  into the noodles), and if available, a wedge of banana blossom. 2.
  For the traditional recipe, omit the shrimps, pork/chicken, and all
  references to them. Substitute 1/2 pound very firm tofu and 1/4 pound
  dried shrimps. Put the tofu on a triple layers of paper towels, cover
  it with another triple layer, put a plate on top of that, and put a
  two pound weight (cans of vegetables for an example) on top of the
  plate.  Let stand for 20 to 30 minutes to press out the excess water.
  Put the dried shrimp in a sieve, rinse them quickly under hot running
  water, and set aside to drain.  After the tofu has been pressed,
  slice it into strips about 1/4 inch thick, 1/2 inch wide and 1 inch
  long. ~--

  hot olive oil for a few minutes and remove to a pot with 4 cups of
  water. Boil chicken for 15 minutes.  Meanwhile, in the same skillet,
  fry the onions and bell peppers. Add tomato. Meanwhile rinse the
  seafood. Add the seafood to the skillet with onions, bell pepper and
  tomato. Cut pimentos into strips and add half to skillet along with
  the peas. Mash garlic, parsley and salt together with the back of a
  wooden spoon and add to pan. Add the saffron, then the chicken, rice
  and sausage. Cover with 4 cups boiling chicken broth. Stir gently to
  distribute ingredients evenly. Bring to a boil for five minutes; then
  reduce heat to medium and continue cooking until rice is tender and
  dry and grains are separated, about 20 to 30 minutes. Do no stir
  during cooking. When done adjust seasoning and add red pepper if you
  wish. Garnish with remaining pimento strips and lemon wedges. Serve
  from pan. Serves six.

      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 ea Shrimp; prawns - raw
  1 1/2 ea Clams; live
      3 lb Chicken;- cut frying up and
    1/3 c  Olive oil
      2 ea Lg Onion;- chopped
      4 c  Garlic; mashed to a paste
    1/4 ts Saffron; spanish
      2 ts Salt
      2 c  Rice; uncooked
      6 c  Hot water
      1 c  Sweet red pimientos
 
  OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS. 1/2     lb   chorizo sausages - casings removed
  and meat crumbled then fried for about 15 mins. in separate pan.
  Drain 3/4 lbs pork shoulder--cubed and well browned in separate pan.
  Drop raw prawns into boiling salted water and cook until they turn
  red. Drain, peel and dive in. Set aside. Scrub live clams in several
  baths of cold water to be sure all the sand is washed away. Do not
  open shells. Pour 1/2 of the olive oil into a frying pan and slowly
  brown chicken pieces. Into a Dutch oven pour the remaining olive oil
  and saute' the onions and garlic until tender but not brown over low
  heat. Add prawns, clams, chicken, saffron, salt and rice (plus
  optional if used. The more the merrier). Add water and simmer gently,
  uncovered, until the rice is cooked. About 35-45 mins. If it becomes
  too dry before the rice is cooked, a little more water may be added,
  but DO NOT stir. If some moisture remains when rice is done, put pan
  into a oven to dry out. Arrange strips of pimento on top and serve in
  the pan in which it was cooked. The latter is why it is important to
  carefully plan your cooking vessel. Hope you enjoy this. It comes
  from Sunset Magazine who seem to always hit the target. BTW, I would
  guess that the beans and peppers were used as fillers as generally
  they are not mentioned in any recipe I have seen.

           Pimiento strips
      2    Lemons, quartered
 
  Preheat over to 350 degrees.  Wash the rice thoroughly under cold
  running water and drain.  Reserve.  Wash both the mussels and clams
  thoroughly until all sand has been removed. Do not soak them in cold
  water. Dry the fish pieces thoroughly with paper towels and season
  with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat 1/4 c olive oil. When
  it is very hot add the fish cubes and brown them on all sides.
  Remove them to a side dish and reserve. To the fat remaining in the
  skillet add the shrimp and cook them over medium heat until they turn
  bright pink. Season with salt and white pepper. Remove the cooked
  shrimp to a side dish and reserve. Add 2 T olive oil to the skillet.
  Add the onion, garlic and red pepper slices and cook until the onions
  are very soft and lightly browned. Be sure not to burn the mixture.
  Add the tomatoes and proscuitto, chilies and saffron. Season the
  mixture with salt and pepper, oregano and basil. Bring to a boil and
  cook, stirring constantly, scraping the bottom of the pan well, until
  most of the tomato juice has evaporated. Add the rice and 3 1/2 cups
  of chicken stock. Bring the mixture to a boil again and cook over
  medium heat until 1/2 of the broth is absorbed. Pour half the rice
  mixture into an earthenware casserole.  Make a layer of fish cubes
  and Chorizo and top with the remaining rice.  Cover the casserole and
  bake the rice for 25 minutes. Uncover the casserole and fold the
  shrimp and peas lightly into the rice. Cover again and continue
  baking for 10 to 15 minutes or until the rice is tender and all the
  broth has been absorbed. If the rice seems dry, yet still too crisp,
  add the remaining chicken stock. Uncover the casserole and bury the
  clams and mussels in the rice. Cover the casserole again and cook for
  another 10 to 15 minutes or until the shells of both mussels and
  clams have opened.  Discard any mussels or clams that have not
  opened. Garnish the paella with pimiento strips and lemon quarters.
  Serve directly from the casserole.

     18 md Raw shrimp
           -- cleaned and deveined
     18    Tender raw bay scallops
     12    Raw oysters
    1/2 lb Fillet of red snapper
           -- cubed
     12 sm Clams in shells
    1/2 lb Raw lobster meat; cubed
     12    Stone crab claws
      4 oz Canned squids (optional)
  1 1/2 c  Chicken broth; hot
      2 c  Long grain white rice
    1/2 c  Dry sherry
           Additional dry sherry
           -- for sprinkling
      9 oz Frozen artichoke hearts
     12    Canned asparagus spears
      2    Whole pimientos
    1/2 c  Cooked small peas
           Parsley bouquets for garnish
 
  Pour oil into a large skillet.  Heat and brown chicken pieces; remove
  to casserole, which should measure 14 inches in diameter. Brown cubed
  pork and lamb chops in skillet and remove to casserole. To the
  drippings, add the onion and the green pepper.  Saute until onion is
  transparent. Add the garlic, bay leaf, and finely chopped tomato.
  Stir to mix and cook 5 minutes. Combine the toasted saffron, 2 cups
  of hot broth, salt, and hot sauce.  Stir into skillet; bring to a
  boil, then pour over meat and chicken in casserole. Again bring to a
  boil, lower heat, cover, and cook until the meat is tender (30
  minutes).  Now, add shrimp, scallops, oysters, cubed red snapper,
  scrubbed clams, lobster meat, stone crab claws, and squids (remove
  part of the ink of the squids and chop squids coarsely). Cook
  approximately 15 minutes at moderate heat, or until the shellfish
  turn pink. Remove stone crab claws for later use.  Half the shell of
  the clams may be removed if desired.  There should be enough liquid
  in casserole to measure about 3-1/2 cups; add more broth if
  necessary. Stir in the 2 cups of rice and mix well to distribute
  evenly in csserole. When it starts to boil, add the 1/2 cup wine.
  Cover the casserole and place in preheated 325 degree F oven for 20
  minutes. Meanwhile cook artichokes according to direction on package.
  Drain and use only 6 to 8 perfect ones. Five minutes before removing
  casserole from oven, uncover and place artichokes around edge of
  casserole. Place the asparagus spears in between artichokes cartwheel
  fashion. Place the stone crab claws in decorative arrangement around
  the casserole. Cut 1 pimiento in strips and place over the rice. Fill
  the remaining pimiento with peas and place in center of casserole,
  pressing down to avoid toppling over. Add parsley bouquets here and
  there for color. Sprinkle all with dry sherry and return to oven
  uncovered for 5 minutes longer. Remove from oven and let stand for at
  least 15 minutes before serving. NOTE: In many parts of Spain, a
  lemon wedge to squeeze over the paella is served with each portion.

  4 minutes or until vegetables are tender and rice is heated through.

     Put on skin on the serving plate, and layer seasonal fruits onto
  it in any pleasant design you can manage. Add spots of whipping cream
  into the design and then put another fried skin onto the fruit but
  with its corners offset from that of the first layer.
  
     To achieve a "pagoda" effect make sure the second layer skin is
  slightly smaller than that first layer. Also try not to put the fruit
  on to cover the entire skin. Leave about a half inch of the edges
  clean.
  
     Cover the second layer with fruit and whipped cream and garnish and
  serve.

      Title: PAHT THAI
 Categories: Thai
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/4 lb Dried rice stick noodles
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 tb Coarsely chopped garlic
      8    Shrimps, peeled and deveined
      1    Egg; lightly beaten
      1 tb Fish sauce
      2 ts Sugar
      2 tb Coarsely chopped peanuts
           -- (dry-roasted type)
      1 c  Bean sprouts
      4    Slender green onions
           -- sliced in 1 inch lengths
      1    Lime; quartered lengthwise
 
  Paht Thai is a noodle dish almost everyone seems to like. A tangle of
  slender rice noodles is sauteed with garlic, shallots, and an
  orchestra of sweet, sour, and salty ingredients that play a piquant
  symphony of Thai flavors.  A handful of fresh bean sprouts provides a
  cooling contrast to the hot, seasoned noodles, and circles of lime
  invite you to bring sourness to center stage as you begin to eat.
  
  Traditional ingredients are salty dried shrimp; crispy pieces of
  fried, pressed bean curd; sweet-sour nuggets of pickled white radish;
  chopped peanuts; flat, green garlic chives; and a balanced chorus --
  sweet, sour, salty, hot -- of palm sugar, tamarind, vinegar, lime,
  brown bean sauce, and crushed dried red chilies.
  
  Thai cooks blithely tinker with the classic formula to create
  signature versions, and you can, too.  Siriluk Williams, owner of
  Sukothai Restaurant in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, gave me her recipe
  for home-style paht Thai. I love its accessible ingredients, simple
  steps, and delicious results.
  
  Instructions: ============= Soak rice noodles in warm water to cover
  for 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare all the remaining
  ingredients and place them next to the stove, along with a small
  serving platter. When the noodles are very limp and white, drain and
  measure out 2 1/2 cups. Set these by the stove as well.
  
  Heat a wok or large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1
  tablespoon of the oil and swirl to coat the surface. When the oil is
  very hot, drop a piece of the garlic into the pan. If it sizzles
  immediately, the oil is ready.  Add the garlic and toss until golden,
  about 30 seconds. Add the shrimp and toss until they turn pink and
  are opaque, no more than 1 minute. Remove from the pan and set aside.
  
  Add the egg to the pan and tilt the pan to spread it into a thin

  break it into small lumps. Remove from the pan and set aside with the
  shrimp.
  
  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, heat for 30 seconds, and add the
  softened noodles.  Using a spatula, spread and pull the noodles into
  a thin layer covering the surface of the pan. Then scrape them into a
  clump again and gently turn them over.  Hook loops of noodles with
  the edge of the spatula and pull them up the sides, spreading them
  out into a layer again. Repeat this process several times as the
  stiff, white noodles soften and curl into ivory ringlets. Add the
  fish sauce and turn the noodles so they are evenly seasoned. Add the
  sugar and peanuts, turning the noodles a few more times.
  
  Reserving a small handful for garnish, add the bean sprouts, along
  with the green onions and shrimp-egg mixture. Cook for 1 minute,
  turning often. Transfer the noodles to the serving platter and
  squeeze the juice of 2 lime wedges over the top.  Garnish with
  remaining bean sprouts and lime wedges and serve at once.
  
  Serves 1 as a main course, 2 as an appetizer.

      Title: PAHT THAI (15)
 Categories: Main dish, Thai
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -=========
 
  Paht Thai is a noodle dish almost everyone seems to like. A tangle of
  slender rice noodles is sauteed with garlic, shallots, and an
  orchestra of sweet, sour, and salty ingredients that play a piquant
  symphony of Thai flavors.  A handful of fresh bean sprouts provides a
  cooling contrast to the hot, seasoned noodles, and circles of lime
  invite you to bring sourness to center stage as you begin to eat.
  
  Traditional ingredients are salty dried shrimp; crispy pieces of
  fried, pressed bean curd; sweet-sour nuggets of pickled white radish;
  chopped peanuts; flat, green garlic chives; and a balanced chorus --
  sweet, sour, salty, hot -- of palm sugar, tamarind, vinegar, lime,
  brown bean sauce, and crushed dried red chilies.
  
  Thai cooks blithely tinker with the classic formula to create
  signature versions, and you can, too.  Siriluk Williams, owner of
  Sukothai Restaurant in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, gave me her recipe
  for home-style paht Thai. I love its accessible ingredients, simple
  steps, and delicious results.
  
  Ingredients:
  
  1/4 lb   dried rice stick noodles 2 tblsp vegetable oil 1 tblsp
  coarsely chopped garlic 8 shrimps, peeled and deveined 1 egg, lightly
  beaten 1 tblsp fish sauce 2 tsp sugar 2 tblsp coarsely chopped,
  dry-roasted peanuts 1 cup bean sprouts 4 slender green onions, sliced
  in 1 inch lengths 1 lime, quartered lengthwise Soak rice noodles in
  warm water to cover for 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare all the
  remaining ingredients and place them next to the stove, along with a
  small serving platter. When the noodles are very limp and white,
  drain and measure out 2 1/2 cups. Set these by the stove as well.
  
  Heat a wok or large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1
  tablespoon of the oil and swirl to coat the surface. When the oil is
  very hot, drop a piece of the garlic into the pan. If it sizzles
  immediately, the oil is ready.  Add the garlic and toss until golden,
  about 30 seconds. Add the shrimp and toss until they turn pink and
  are opaque, no more than 1 minute. Remove from the pan and set aside.
  
  Add the egg to the pan and tilt the pan to spread it into a thin
  sheet. As soon as it begins to set and is opaque, scramble it to
  break it into small lumps. Remove from the pan and set aside with the
  shrimp.
  
  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, heat for 30 seconds, and add the
  softened noodles.  Using a spatula, spread and pull the noodles into
  a thin layer covering the surface of the pan. Then scrape them into a
  clump again and gently turn them over.  Hook loops of noodles with
  the edge of the spatula and pull them up the sides, spreading them
  out into a layer again. Repeat this process several times as the
  stiff, white noodles soften and curl into ivory ringlets. Add the
  fish sauce and turn the noodles so they are evenly seasoned. Add the
  sugar and peanuts, turning the noodles a few more times.
  
  Reserving a small handful for garnish, add the bean sprouts, along
  with the green onions and shrimp-egg mixture. Cook for 1 minute,
  turning often. Transfer the noodles to the serving platter and
  squeeze the juice of 2 lime wedges over the top.  Garnish with
  remaining bean sprouts and lime wedges and serve at once.
  
  Serves 1 as a main course, 2 as an appetizer.

 Categories: Main dish, Indian, Tofu, Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 lb Firm tofu, drained, cubed
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
           Oil for deep-frying
      2 tb Ghee
  2 1/2 lb Frozen, chopped spinach
      6 c  Fresh tomatoes, cubed
      2 tb Ghee
      2 ts Curry powder
      2 ts Asafetida
  1 1/2 ts Ground cumin
      1 ts Ground coriander
    3/4 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/2 ts Black pepper
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Allspice
    1/4 ts Cloves
      2 tb Soy sauce
 
  Soak first 2 ingredients together while heating the oil to 350
  degrees. Remove cubes from soy sauce and drain a few seconds in a
  strainer to remove excess soy sauce. Drop tofu cubes in heated oil
  all at once (or in a couple of separate batches if you desire) and
  cook till browned and a little crisp on the outside. Remove from oil
  and drain on plate covered with 2 to 3 thicknesses of paper towels.
  Leftover soy sauce can be kept and used later.
  
  As the tofu cubes are cooking (or before you start frying them),
  combine the next 3 ingredients together in a skillet. Cover and put
  on medium flame to simmer for 10 minutes. Remove lid and mix well
  (the frozen spinach should be thawed and mixable by now).
  
  Leave uncovered over medium flame to allow some of the juices to cook
  off as you make the chaunce.  This is done by heating the ghee or oil
  in a butter-warming pot and adding all the spices listed. Toast in
  oil till the fragrance of the spices fills the kitchen and the spices
  appear to be browned.  Pour into cooking vegetables immediately, add
  soy sauce and mix thoroughly till tomatoes break up.
  
  Turn off heat, add cooked tofu cubes, and cover for a few minutes
  before serving.  Makes 8 entree-sized servings or twice as many side
  dish sized servings.

 Categories: Jewish, Viennese, Brunch
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      1 tb Brandy
      1 c  Apricot or strawberry jam

MMMMM---------------------------CREPES--------------------------------
      1 c  Flour
        pn Salt
      2 tb Sugar
      1 c  Milk
      2    Eggs

MMMMM-----------------------TO COOK CREPES----------------------------
           Butter as needed
 
  Stir the brandy into the jam and set aside.
  
  Sift the flour into a bowl along with the salt and sugar. Gradually
  add the milk, to make a smooth batter. Add the lightly beaten eggs
  and stir again until the batter is once more smooth.
  
  Heat a 9 inch skillet (nonstick would be perfect) and pour in just
  enough melted butter to cover the whole surface of the pan when the
  pan is tilted. Pour in enough batter to cover the pan thinly, but
  completely. *Tip-Kind of rotate the pan just after batter is poured
  in to spread the batter all around quickly. It's really easy and
  after a couple crepes you'll be an expert! Cook the crepe over medium
  heat until the underside is lightly browned and the pancake is firm.
  Turn the crepe over and brown it lightly on the other side. Don't
  overcook as they can become stiff. Tranfer the crepe to a platter and
  cover with a thin coating of the jam. Roll it up neatly, place it on
  an ovenproof or silver platter and keep it warm in a 250 degree oven
  with a tea towel placed over the top. Repeat this procedure until all
  the batter is used, laying the Palatschinken side by side or stacking
  them like logs. Dust the finished Palatschinken generousely with
  vanilla sugar or powdered sugar and serve.

      8 oz Unsweetened chocolate
      2    Sticks Unsalted butter
      2 c  Walnuts, be generous
      5 lg Eggs
      2 ts Pure vanilla extract

      1 tb Plus 1 teaspoon powdered
           -instant Expresso
  3 3/4 c  Sugar
  1 2/3 c  Unbleached flour -- sifted
 
  Adjust an oven rack one-third up from the bottom and preheat oven to
  425 degrees.  Line a 9x11x2-inch pan with foil. Brush well with
  melted butter. Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a large
  double boiler over hot water on moderate heat or in a small, heavy
  saucepan on low heat, stirring occasionally. When combined, remove
  from heat and set aside. Break the walnuts into pieces if necessary,
  trying to keep them fairly large. In the large bowl of an electric
  mixer, beat the eggs with the vanilla and almond extracts, salt,
  expresso and sugar at high speed for 10 minutes. On low speed, add
  the chocolate mixture and beat only until mixed. Remove the bowl from
  the mixer and stir in the nuts. Pour the batter into the prepared
  pan. Bake for 35 minutes, reversing the pan from front to back once
  to insure even baking.  At the end of 35 minutes, the cake will have
  a firm crust, but when tested with a toothpick will appear
  underbaked. Do not be concerned, it is done.  Remove the pan from the
  oven and let stand until cool. Invert the brownies onto a cookie
  sheet and remove the foil. Cover with length of waxed paper and
  another cookie sheet, invert again. This cake MUST be covered and
  refrigerated for a few hours or overnight before it is cut into bars.
  
  Makes 32 JUMBO brownies.

      Title: PALOMBO COI PISELLE
 Categories: Italian, Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      3 tb Olive oil
    1/2 c  Minced onion
      1 lb Ripe tomatoes *
      2 c  Fresh or thawed frozen peas
    1/2 ts Salt, or to taste
           Freshly ground pepper to
           -taste
      4    Skinless leopard shark
           -filets **
      3 tb Chopped fresh mint leaves
 
  * peeled, seeded, and chopped, with juice ** or small shark steaks (1
  1/2 pounds in all)
  
  This is a loose interpretation of a favorite Roman dish. Palombo is
  the Italian name for a small shark related to leopard shark,
  typically cooked and served with peas. This recipe makes just enough
  sauce to moisten the fish; if you want to serve it over couscous, add
  another cup or so of tomato juice.
  
  Combine the oil and onion in a large skillet and cook over medium
  heat just until the onion begins to color. Add the tomatoes, fresh
  peas, salt and pepper and cook until the tomatoes release their
  juice, about 5 minutes. (Wait to add thawed frozen peas until you add
  the shark.)
  
  Season the shark pieces with a little more salt and pepper and lay
  them in among the vegetables. Cover and cook until the shark is
  tender, 6 to 8 minutes depending on thickness. Transfer the fish to
  warm plates, stir the mint into the skillet, correct the seasoning,
  and spoon the sauce and peas over and around the fish.

 Categories: Russian, Christmas, Breads
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      2 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  ;Water
      2 pk Active Dry Yeast
    1/4 c  Milk
      5 c  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
           -; Up To 6 May Be Needed
    1/4 lb Butter; 1 Stick
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 lg Eggs
      3 lg Egg Yolks
      1 ts Salt; If Using Sweet Butter
      1 ts Vanilla Extract
           Zest Of One Lemon
      1 c  Rose Preserve Or Any Dry
           -Fruit Preserve
           Powdered Sugar; As Needed
 
  Combine the sugar and water, sprinkle with the yeast, and let stand
  until soft.  Heat the milk to lukewarm, and add the milk and 1/4 cup
  of the flour to the yeast mixture. Beat well, cover and allow to rise
  until light and bubbly, about 10 minutes.  In another bowl, cream the
  butter and sugar. Beat eggs and egg yolks together, blending well and
  combine with the sugar-butter mixture, beating thoroughly until the
  eggs are pale white. Grate a lemon on a fine grater until all of the
  yellow color is grated off and add this (the zest), vanilla, and the
  yeast mixture to the butter-egg mixture.  Mix in 4 cups of flour.  If
  the dough seems a little loose, add a little more, but the dough
  should be soft. Knead, by hand, for about 10 minutes.  Replace in a
  greased bowl, turning once to grease the top, and cover with a damp
  towel, set in a warm place until double in bulk. Punch down, knead a
  few more times, and allow to rise again until the dough is doubled.
  When doubled, divide the dough into 4 parts. On a lightly floured
  surface, roll one part into a rectangle about 1/4-inch thick, turning
  once or twice during the rolling to achieve a uniform thickness. Dust
  with flour sparingly.  Place 1 ts of rose preserve at evenly space
  intervals on the dough, or with a 2 1/2-inch cutter, gently form
  impressions and place the filling in each.  Roll another portion out,
  as above, to the same thickness, and gently cover the first,
  overlapping a little. (Filling will show through.) Cut circles with
  the cutter. Place them on a lightly floured cookie sheet and allow
  rise until double in size. Repeat until all of the dough is used,
  rolling out the scraps last. Heat oil or shortening to 375 degrees F.
  in a deep fryer or wide skillet. Test the temperature by frying a
  piece of bread; it should bubble and turn golden quickly. The fat
  should not be smoking.  Fry 5 or 6 pampushky at a time. Do NOT crowd
  as this lowers the temperature and the doughnuts will absorb too much
  grease. When one side is golden, flip with a spoon to fry the other
  side. Dough will puff up in the frying.  Perfect pampushky are light
  as air. Drain on paper towels. When slightly cooled, sprinkle with
  powdered sugar.
  
  Serve with tea.

  Recipe by: Craig Gardiner KNHT09A *NOTE: This must be made a day
  ahead of serving.
        In a large bowl, finely chop tomatoes, scallions, red onions,
  peppers, olives, capers, pickles, garlic and anchovies. Season the
  mixture with paprika and salt and pepper to taste. Blend in red wine
  vinegar and olive oil.
   Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
        Split a long, narrow loaf of French bread in half lengthwise as
  equally as possible.  Carefully pull out the soft bread from the
  center, but leave a crust wall at least 1/2 inch thick. Process the
  soft bread in the food processor until finely chopped. Add the bread
  crumbs to the vegetable mixture with 2 tablespoons more olive oil.
  Let rest 20 minutes, then taste again and adjust seasoning, adding
  more oil if it seems dry.
        Stuff loaf with vegetable/bread mixture, so that all interior
  spaces are filled but so that loaf still closes tightly. Tie with
  string to hold everything in place, wrap in foil and refrigerate for
  at least 24 hours.
       Slice loaf into 1-inch slices and serve very cold, 2 or 3 slices
  per person.  This is eaten with a knife and fork. This is also very
  good made in small, individual loaves.

           -& chopped
      1 tb Vinegar
 
  *Anne's note: The nutritional analysis omit the anchovies; they would
  substantinally increase the sodium in the recipe
  
  "Pan Bagnat is the name for this stuffed sandwich in Monaco and in
  France (where the name is hyphenated). The fillings can vary. For
  example, Bordeaux-born Celine Beteta Wong, who works in the office of
  the Consulate in New York, says she also fills her Pan Bagnat with
  tuna. It can be a complete meal - great for a picnic or bag lunch.
  This recipe is from the late Princess Grace of Monaco, who graciously
  shared it with me many years ago."
  
  1. Slice the roll in half horizontially. Remove part of the bread to
  allow space for the filling. 2. Divide all the filling evenly among
  the 4 rools. Begin by drizzling the bottom of the rolls with a little
  oil. Drop some onion, bell pepper, tomato, egg, anchovy (if you are
  using it) and olives into each roll bottom (the filling maounts are
  personal choices). 3. Season to your taste with viengar. Cover the
  roll with the top half. Serve cold.

 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------MAITRE D"HOTEL SAUCE-------------------------
    1/2    Clove garlic, smashed
    1/4 c  Butter
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Lemon juice
    1/8 ts Pepper
      1 tb Finely minced parsley

MMMMM--------------------------THE FISH-------------------------------
    1/4 c  Yellow cornmeal
      4    1-lb. bass, dressed and
           And skinned
    1/4 c  Flour
      4 tb Butter
           Salt and fresh pepper
 
  This recipe includes a very simple sauce that enhances sauteed,
  broiled or baked fish.  It can be made in camp if you brought parsley
  and usually impresses any old "fried fish angler."
  
  Make the sauce first.
    In a bowl set the butter out to soften.  Then cream it with a fork
  and then a spoon until it is light and fluffy. Work in the salt and
  pepper.
    Mix the smashed garlic and the lemon juice, then work this liquid
  into the butter.  Take a bit of time to do this.
    Mix in the parsley and serve in a gravy boat with a spoon.
    Pan fry the bass remembering to brown the fish on both sides but
  not to over cook.
    Serve hot on hot plates and pass the sauce.

      Title: PAN FRIED OR SAUTEED YELLOW PERCH
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      6 sm Yellow perch
           7-9 " long
      4 tb Bacon fat or lard
           Salt and pepper
      4 tb Butter
           Cornmeal
      1    Lemon (opt.)
 
  Dress, scale, and what the fish, pat dry, salt and pepper, then
  dredge them in the meal or meal-flour combination.
    Heat the fat until it is hot enough to cook at once, but not
  burning, sputtering hot.  Lay in the fish, turn heat down to barely a
  medium flame, and begin to brown the fish. Keep the fish loose from
  the pan bottom with a thin metal spatula.
    Taking 8-10 minutes to a side (turn heat low if it seems to fry too
  fast), brown the fish slowly until crisp. Do not overcook. When the
  flesh is opaque the fish is done; one hopes it's all browned by then.
    Add 4 Tbs. butter to the skillet after removing the fish and
  squeeze in the juice of a lemon, stir the fat and juices to loosen
  the dredgings, and pour over the browned fish.
  
  VARIATION:  After removing the fish from the skillet, toss about 1/3
  cup of chopped black walnuts.  Brown lightly with the remaining
  butter and sprinkle over the fish before serving.

  Simmer liver and onions in stock for 30-40 minutes. Put oatmeal in a
  heavy pan over heat or under the grill, and toast until nicely
  browned. When the meat is cooked, remove from pan, keeping liquid.
  Mince liver and onions, add oatmeal, suet, salt and pepper. Moisten
  with sufficient liquid to give a softish consistency, put in a
  greased pudding basin and cover with a double lid of foil, and steam

     12    Pancetta; thinly sliced
     12    Fresh sage leaves
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      1 tb Vegetable oil

    1/2 c  Dry white wine
           Polenta or mashed potatoes,
           -for serving
 
  Recipe by: Food and Wine - Dec 93 1. Wash the quail thouroughly
  inside and out, then place them in a large colander to drain for at
  least
       20    minutes.
  
  2.  Pat the quail dry.  Stuff the cavity of each bird with 1 slice of
  pancetta and 1 sage leaf.
  
  3.  Put the butter and oil in a large heavy skillet on high heat.
  When the fat is hot, add all the quail in a single layer and cook
  until browned on one side. Graduall turn them and continue cooking
  until they are evenly browned all over.  Sprinkle the quail with salt
  and pepper, then add the white wine and turn the birds once.
  
  4.  Let the wine bubble for about 1 minute, then lower the heat to
  moderate and partially cover the pan. Cook the quail until the meat
  feels very tender when poked with a fork and comes away from the
  bone, 45 minutes to 1 hour.  Check from time to time that there is
  sufficient juices in the pan to keep the birds from sticking; if not
  add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water. When the quail are done, transfer
  them to a warmed serving platter.
  
  5.  Add 1/4 cup of water to the skillet.  Boil over high heat,
  scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen any
  cooking residues, until the water boils away and only a few drops of
  dark pan juices for each bird remain.  Pour the juices over the quail
  and serve with polenta or mashed potatoes.

      2 tb Butter

  Combine cornmeal, flour, lemon peel and cayenne in shallow dish.
  Season with salt.  Pour buttermilk into second shallow dish. Dip 1
  fish fillet into buttermilk, then into cornmeal mixture, coating
  completely. Repeat process with remaining fish.  (Note from me: Let
  fish stand for approximately 15 minutes before proceeding.) Melt
  butter with oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add
  fish and cook until crust is golden brown and fish is cooked through,
  turning once, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer fish to platter.
  Sprinkle with minced parsley. Garnish with lemon wedges.
  
  NOTE:  If you let the fish sit coated for the 15 minutes that I
  recommend, this dish will take 45 minutes. Believe me, let the fish
  sit for the 15 minutes; it will keep the coating on the fish with no
  hassle whatsoever.

      1 c  Vegetable oil
      1 c  Flour

    3/4 c  Instant Potato flakes
      1 c  Milk
      1    Egg
    1/2 ts Sage or Poultry Seasoning
           Salt / Pepper to taste
           Any other favorite seasoning
           You like in your breading
 
  :       BONE-IN BREASTS:  'Finger-bone' the breasts... you don't need
  a knife to bone out a chicken breast... tear the skin off, turn over
  (rib side up) and work fingers under 'keel' (breast) bone and tear
  off. Work fingers between rib section and meat and pull away, ending
  up at wing joint.  Pull out wing joint section. One bone is left
  buried in upper edge of meat (wishbone, or collar bone of chicken).
  Pull bone towards bottom tip of breast, tearing it from meat and
  yanking remaining cartilage away (left from keel bone). Voila!
  Perfectly boned breast.
  :       On underside (rib side) of breast there's a long strip of
  meat in center that can be pulled away. This is the 'tenderloin' of
  the breast, or also known as the 'chicken tender'. Tear these off
  whole. Remaining breast is flat.  Cut lengthwise in half. Carefully,
  with knife horizontal to cutting board, slice the thickness in half
  for each piece. You should have 20 pieces... 4 from each breast and 4
  tenders.
  
  OIL:  Heat the cup of vegetable oil on high in large skillet or
  frying pan.
  
  BREADING:
  :       Mix dry ingredients in a plastic bag, shaking well.
  Increase/decrease/add/subtract as your tastebuds and preferences
  warrant. Whip egg and milk 'til smooth in large bowl. Put all pieces
  in bowl to thoroughly wet. Scoop out all meat and put in plastic bag,
  don't bother draining, the more the merrier.  Shake vigorously. Well,
  shake the bag vigorously, you can stand still if you like.
  
  FRYING:  Place 4-6 pieces of meat in pan, frying 'til golden brown,
  turning occasionally.  Turn the meat...don't have your back to the
  stove! Drain on paper towels.
  
  SERVING:  Eat at least one of the first pieces fried while frying the
  rest, no one will ever know.  Serve remaining pieces with any other
  dishes you deserve... er, like. Asparagus and potatoes, spaghetti and
  sauce, etc. (I had etc. the other night... it's only good when picked
  fresh!)
  
  NOTE:  Breading mixture is great with fish fillet, liver,
  chicken-fried steak, or anything else you like to panfry. You can
  pre-mix in a large quantity and store in tightly covered jar or
  canister and have ready to use.  Be sure to shake well before
  removing some for use (if in California, just leave on porch or under
  a doorway..)
  
  ENJOY!

    2/3 c  Chicken broth

MMMMM-------------------PORK & VEGETABLE SAUCE------------------------
      2 tb Peanut oil
      1 lb Bok choy
           - cut into 2-in sections
    1/2 lb Barbecued pork strips
    1/2 c  Chicken broth
      1 tb Thin soy sauce
      1 tb Chinese rice wine
           -=OR=- dry sherry
      1 tb Oyster sauce
      1 tb Cornstarch; dissolved in
      2 tb Cold chicken broth
 
  BLANCH 1 POUND FRESH noodles in boiling water to wash away the starch
  and to loosen them up (about 2 minutes). Drain them well. Scatter the
  noodles in a baking pan. Use a pair of chopsticks and your hands to
  untangle them as much as possible. Put a layer of the noodles 1-inch
  deep in each of 2 large, heavy skillets. Pour 2 tablespoons of oil
  and 1/3 cup chicken broth in each. Cook over a low flame until the
  broth boils away and the bottom becomes brown and crisp. From time to
  time, add a little oil and broth to keep the noodles moist and allow
  the crust to develop slowly. This should take about 10-to-12 minutes.
  To flip, first shake the pan to make sure the cake is not stuck to
  the bottom (if it is, dribble some oil around the edge to loosen it).
  Cover the pan with a wide lid. Flip the skillet over, holding the lid
  firmly. The cake will drop onto the lid. Slide the cake back into the
  pan to brown it on the other side. Add more oil around the edge if it
  seems to be sticking. To serve, slide it out onto a plate and use it
  as a base for any dish with sauce.
  
  TO MAKE THE PORK AND VEGETABLE SAUCE: Heat the peanut oil in a wok.
  When it is hot, add the bok choy and stir-fry to coat with oil. Add
  the pieces of pork and stir-fry to heat through. Add the broth. Stir
  in the soy sauce, rice wine or sherry, and oyster sauce. When the
  sauce is hot, thicken it with the dissolved cornstarch and serve on
  the bed of pan-fried noodles.

 Categories: Seafood, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 lb Assorted fresh mushrooms,
           -such as white, shiitake,
           -oyster or chanerelle
           -large mushrooms quartered
      5 tb Cold unsalted butter, 2
           -tablespoons cut into pieces
           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper
      3 md Leeks, white and tender
           -green, finely chopped
    1/2 c  Chicken stock or canned
           -low-sodium broth
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      4    Sea (6-ounce) bass fillets
           -with skin, about 1-1/2 in.
           -thick
    1/4 c  Finely chopped fresh
           -flat-leaf parsley
 
  You need thick, firm-fleshed fish fillets to take the heat of
  pan-roasting; sea bass is ideal because the skin crisps up so nicely
  in the hot pan. Tilefish makes a good alternative.
  
  1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet until almost smoking. Add the
  mushrooms and cook over moderately high heat, stirring, for 2
  minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon of the butter, reduce the heat to low
  and cook until the mushrooms are browned and the pan is dry, about 7
  minutes. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a saucepan.
  
  2. Melt 2 more tablespoons of the butter in the skillet. Add the
  leeks, cover and cook over low heat, stirring a few times, until
  tender, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and add to the
  mushrooms along with the chicken stock; simmer for 3 minutes. Season
  with salt and pepper.
  
  3. Preheat the oven to 450 B0. In a large, heavy-bottomed ovenproof
  skillet, heat the vegetable oil until almost smoking. Season the fish
  with salt and pepper and add to the skillet, skin side down. Shake
  the skillet to loosen the fillets and cook over high heat until the
  skin is browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Turn the fillets,
  transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for about 4 minutes, or
  until the fish is just cooked through.
  
  4. Stir the butter pieces and chopped parsley into the mushroom-leek
  sauce. Divide the sauce among 4 large plates and set the bass fillets
  on top. Serve at once.

 Categories: None
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4    Squab or cornish game hens
      1 lg Carrot, diced
      2    Ribs celery, diced
      1 md Onion, diced
      2 qt Chicken stock or
           -reduced-salt broth
    1/4 ts Dried thyme
      3 lg Shallots, diced
    1/4 lb Bing cherries, pits removed
      1 c  Red wine
           Salt and pepper
    1/2 lb Salsify
           -(substitute parsnips)
      2 tb Lemon juice or white vinegar
      5 tb Unsalted butter
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      3 bn Fresh spinach
 
  1. Heat oven to 450 degrees. Cut (or have the butcher cut) legs and
  breast meat with wings attached from the carcass of each squab. Cut
  off wing tips. Cover breast and leg pieces and refrigerate. Place
  carcasses and wing tips in a roasting pan and cook in the oven until
  well browned. 2. Add diced carrot, celery and onion to the pan and
  continue to roast until vegetables are soft. Reserve 3/4 cup of
  chicken stock and add the remainder to the pan along with the thyme.
  Lower heat to 375 degrees and simmer stock for 2 to 3 hours. Strain
  through a fine sieve. There should be about 4 cups of strained stock.
  If there is more, pour the stock into a saucepan and boil atop the
  stove until reduced to 4 cups. 3. In a saucepan, cook shallots in 1
  tablespoon butter until softened. Add cherries and cover with red
  wine. Raise heat and boil wine until almost completely evaporated.
  Add strained squab stock and cook at a brisk simmer until reduced to
  sauce consistency, about 2 cups. This will take an hour or more.
  Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Recipe may be done ahead to
  this point. Let sauce cool, cover surface with plastic wrap and
  refrigerate. Return squab and sauce to room temperature before
  continuing.) 4. Peel salsify, placing peeled stalks in water with 2
  tablespoons lemon juice or white vinegar. Slice salsify crosswise
  into thin rounds and dry on paper towels. Melt 2 tablespoons butter
  in a large sauce pan. Add salsify and turn to coat with butter. Add
  1/2 cup reserved stock and simmer until salsify is tender. Keep warm.
  5. Return oven to 450 degrees. Place remaining 2 tablespoons butter
  and 1 tablespoon oil in an oven-proof skillet large enough to hold
  the squab pieces in a single layer. (If necessary, use 2 skillets.)
  Brown pieces on all sides, then remove breast pieces. Place skillet
  in the oven and cook legs for 5 minutes. Add breast meat and cook for
  3 to 5 minutes, or until medium rare. Remove from oven and let meat
  rest, loosely covered for about 5 minutes. (If using Cornish game
  hens, cook until completely done.) 6. Meanwhile, return salsify to
  the heat. Add spinach and remaining 1/4 cup stock, cover pan and
  steam, tossing once or twice, until spinach is completely wilted.
  Season to taste with salt and pepper. 7. Make a bed of spinach and
  salsify in the center of each plate. Pour or spoon cherry sauce
  around the spinach bed and arrange 2 squab breasts and 2 legs atop
  sauce on each plate. Serve with a sangiovese wine such as Atlas Peak.

  NOTES :     In 1980, as the captain of Team USA, he led the team into
  its first gold medal in the hot food division of the International
  Kochkunst Ausstellung, held in Frankfurt, Germany. Chef Friedenreich
  says that victory, along with opening his own restaurant in 1979 and
  passing his certified master chef exam five years ago, are the
  highlights of his culinary career. Chef Friedenreich describes his
  demo recipe -- pan-seared grouper with soft ancho polenta and avocado
  sauce Choron -- as New World Cuisine. In it, he marries classical,
  old world touches, with new world products and techniques. For
  example, he prepares a traditional sauce Choron then embellishes it
  with diced avocados.

      Title: PAN-SEARED SALMON W/ ROASTED CUMIN-CORIANDER
 Categories: Mexican
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------SALMON--------------------------------
      6    8 oz salmon fillets
           -skin intact
      1 c  Fresh oregano leaves
           -stemmed & finely minced
      1 c  Fresh basil leaves
           -stemmed & finely minced
      1 c  Fresh parsley leaves
           -stemmed & finely minced
    1/2 c  Olive oil

MMMMM-------------------CUMIN-CORIANDER CREMA------------------------
  1 1/2 tb Cumin seed
      1 tb Coriander seed
      1 c  Plain yogurt
      2 tb Heavy cream
    1/2    Bunch fresh cilantro
           -stemmed and chopped
      2    Cloves garlic
           Juice of 1 lemon

MMMMM-----------------------CHIPOTLE SALSA----------------------------
      1    Egg
      1 ts Ground red chile
           -preferably Chimayo
      1    Chipotle chile in adobo
           Juice of 1/2 lemon
      1    Clove garlic
  1 1/4 c  Olive oil
 
  Chef Jason Aufrichtig created this light treatment for rich salmon.
  When purchasing the salmon, ask for fillets not steaks. The chipotle
  chile in adobo that is called for in the salsa is a canned product,
  sold at Latino groceries. The chiles keep for weeks in the
  refrigerator if they are first transferred to a nonreactive
  container. They are packed in a red chile sauce, to which vinegar has
  been added, and are very piquant. There is no substitution for the
  zippy taste they add to sauces and fillings. Rinse and dry each
  salmon fillet. It is not necessary to remove the skin from the
  fillets. Check for pinbones by running your fingertips over the flesh
  side of the fillet. Use pliers or tweezers to remove any bones. In a
  small bowl stir together the oregano, basil, and parsley. Pat the
  herbs onto the flesh side of each fillet, covering well. Refrigerate
  until ready to cook. To prepare the crema, combine the cumin and
  coriander seeds in a small, dry saute pan over medium heat. Roast the
  seeds, shaking the pan frequently, until the aromas are released,
  about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Place the spices
  in a spice mill or coffee grinder and grind to pulverize the seeds.
  Alternatively, pulverize in a mortar using a pestle. In a small bowl,
  combine the ground seeds with all the remaining crema ingredients.
  Let sit for 30 minutes so the flavors can develop and blend. Pour
  through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl to remove the cilantro
  leaves. You will have about 1 cup. (The crema will keep for up to 1
  week in the refrigerator.) To prepare the salsa, place all the
  ingredients, except the olive oil, in a food processor fitted with
  the metal blade or in a blender. Blend thoroughly. With the motor
  running, slowly pour in the olive oil in a thin, steady stream,
  continuing to process until a mayonnaiselike sauce is achieved.
  Transfer to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate until serving. You will
  have about 1 1/4 cups. (The salsa will keep for up to 2 days in the
  refrigerator.) About 15 minutes before serving, place a saute' pan
  large enough to hold the salmon, with room to spare, over medium
  heat. Add the olive oil. When the oil is just smoking, put the
  fillets in the pan, herb sides down. Cook 4 to 5 minutes, then turn
  and cook on the second side until done, 4 to 5 minutes longer.
  Cooking times vary according to taste and the thickness of the
  fillet. At Cafe Pasqual's fish is considered done when the middle is
  still moist and a bit darker than the surrounding light pink flesh.
  To serve, spoon the crema onto individual plates, dividing it equally
  among them. Place 1 salmon fillet on each plate, herbed sides up, to
  cover half the crema. Drizzle the salsa decoratively onto the fillet
  and then onto the visible half of the crema.

      1 c  Coconut milk
      2 tb Red curry paste
      2 tb Creamy peanut butter
      1 tb Fish sauce
      1 tb Sugar
      2 tb Oil
    1/4 c  Thai or sweet basil leaves
 
  Form ground beef into 1" in diameter balls and coat evenly with flour,
  shaking off any excess flour. In a medium saucepan, brown meatballs
  in oil over low heat. The meatballs do not have to be thoroughly
  cooked. Drain on paper towels and set aside. Add the curry paste to
  the remaining oil from frying the meatballs and saute for 1 minute
  over low heat. Increase heat to medium, add coconut milk and cook 2-3
  minutes longer. Stir in fish sauce, sugar, peanut butter and blend
  well. Return the meatballs to the pan of curry mixture and cook until

      Title: PANCAKES 5
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -========
           -(makes ca. 8  4" ones)
 
  Ingredients:
  
  1 cup    loosely packed flour 1 tblsp baking powder 1 egg 1/2 cup
  milk 1/2 cup  water 1 tblsp oil (canola seems to be the healthiest)
  1. Whisk flour and baking powder (I sift 'em together, but if you
  don't have a sifter, no problem).
  
  2.  Whisk egg, oil, milk and water together (seems to mix better if
  mix egg, oil and milk first, then add water).
  
  3.  Stirring liquid, slowly whisk in flour and baking powder mix.
  Don't over whisk, as this'll toughen the pancakes. A few lumps are
  okay. Slowing adding flour and baking power mix makes this step a bit
  easier.
  
  4.  Pour on a hot griddle (see below on determining temp.). I use
  about 1.5 spoonfuls of a large serving spoon and use the back of the
  spoon to spread out the mixture a bit so its not so thick that they
  don't cook through. Turn when bottom is turning dark (too bad they
  don't make clear pancake griddles).  Using the corner of the turner,
  knock several holes in the pancakes.  Done when bottom is turning
  dark.  Only turn once.
  
  5.  Stack for a minute or two when done so the tops warm so butter
  will melt.  Stack too long, and they'll get soggy.
  
  Determining correct griddle temperature:
  
  On my stove, medium high does fine.
  
  Make sure water sizzles on it and small drops evaporate in just a few
  seconds.
  
  The pancakes should get quite brown (actually close to black) when on
  the griddle for just a few minutes (2 or 3?) and the edges on the top
  should thicken.  A few bubbles should form on the middle of the top.
  
  I cooked 'em at too low a temperature for years and a hot griddle
  really helps I've found; don't worry if you incinerate a few in the
  process of figuring out the correct setting on your stove; that's
  what kitchen trash cans are for.
  
  Hints for lighter, fluffier pancakes:
  
  Before mixing liquid and powder mixture, heat the liquid to room
  temperature (microwaves are great for this; just thought of it, but
  maybe hot water w/ cold milk & egg might work too).
  
  After mixing liquid and powder, let sit for 5 or 10 minutes and mix
  no more you'll see it rise a bit and bubbles form).
  
  The water/milk as opposed to all milk ingredients helps here too (got
  this from Usenet's rec.food.cooking).
  
  Note on batter thickness:
  
  The batter should, well, be not too thick or thin.  I judge this by
  how it pours on the griddle; I find I need to spread the batter
  around a bit with the back of a spoon. If too thin, next time add a
  tablespoon or two of flour.  Note that I call for somewhat packed
  flour above as this seems to give me the correct amount of flour for
  proper consistency (flour can be compacted to some degree).

      1 lg Pinch Sugar
      1 lg Pinch Chili Powder
 
  This delightful dish is an innovative and economical way to serve a
  do-it-yourself-style appetizer or main-dish. It is usually presented
  in a special lacquered wood or china tray with the required number of
  compartments.  It is just as effective served on a tray in small
  bowls or dishes.  The pancakes can be made in advance and kept
  refrigerated until needed, and many of the fillings can also be
  prepared ahead of time for convenience.
  
  Sift the flour into a mixing bowl and make a well in the center. Add
  the beaten egg, water, milk and seasonings and beat until smooth,
  then set aside for
       20    minutes.
  
  Drain the Chinese mushrooms, reserving the liquid. Discard the stems,
  then squeeze out as much water as possible from the caps and shred
  them very finely. Place in a small pan and simmer for 6 minutes with
  2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 teaspoons sugar and enough reserved water
  to just cover. Drain well.
  
  Peel the carrot; cut lengthwise into thin strips, then into fine
  shreds. Cut the shreds into 1-inch lengths. Heat a small pan, add a
  very little vegetable oil and a few drops of sesame oil and stir-fry
  the carrot until softened but still uncolored.  Add a little salt,
  pepper and soy sauce and remove from the heat. Rinse out the pan.
  
  Peel and grate the radish and cook in the same way as the carrot,
  omitting the soy sauce.  Trim the green onions, cut into short
  lengths and shred finely. Stir-fry briefly in vegetable oil until
  just softened.
  
  Beat the egg whites until slightly frothy, adding a very small pinch
  of salt and pepper.  Rub a small omelet pan or a well-seasoned wok
  with oil and pour in the egg. Tilt the pan so that the egg runs
  thinly over as wide an area as possible.  Cook until firm but not
  colored on the underside, then flip over and cook the other side
  briefly. Repeat this with the egg yolks, taking care to cook them
  gently so they do not burn. Cut into narrow shreds, then cut
  crosswise into short lengths.
  
  Very thinly shred the kim chee, squeezing to remove as much liquid as
  possible.  Cut the beef into paper-thin slices (having it partially
  frozen makes this easier, then cut crosswise into very thin shreds.
  Heat a little vegetable oil and sesame oil together in a pan or wok
  and stir-fry the beef until it changes color, then splash in 1
  tablespoon soy sauce, a sprinkle of salt, pepper and sugar and a
  little extra sesame oil.
  
  Toast the sesame seeds in a dry pan over moderate heat until they turn
  golden and begin to pop.  Remove, cool slightly and grind to a fairly
  fine powder.
  
  Mix the sauce ingredients together and divide among several dishes.
  Rub the omelet pan or wok again with oil. Pour in a large spoonful of
  the batter and cook until the underside is golden and small bubbles
  appear on the surface.  Flip over and cook the other side. Continue
  to cook pancakes over medium heat until batter is used up, stacking
  the pancakes under a cloth.
  
  Serve the pancakes and fillings at room temperature on a tray with the
  dipping sauce.

           Black mustard seeds
           Fennel seeds
           Nigella seeds
           Fenugreek seeds
 
  This spice blend in Bengal, in eastern India, consists of whole seeds
  of cumin, black mustard, fennel, nigella, and fenugreek in equal
  amounts. If you aren't accustomed to Indian spice mixtures, you might
  want to start with a smaller proportion of fenugreek -- perhaps
  one-third as much as the other spices -- because in large quantities
  it adds a bitterness that some people find unpleasant.  This blend is
  not ground, but is heated in ghee or oil just before using to release
  the flavors of the seeds. The dry seeds can be stored for at least
  four months in an airtight container away from light and heat.

 Categories: Italian, Breads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 oz Fresh yeast
    500 ml Warm water
      2 lb Strong white flour
 
  ("Strong white flour" is a UK term for all-purpose flour. Use bread
  flour if you can get it, preferably unbleached.) Dissolve the yeast
  in 150 ml of the warm water in a small bowl. Sift in enough of the
  flour to make a soft dough, mixing with the hands.  Cover and put in
  a warm place to rise. When the yeast dough has at least doubled in
  size, begin making the rest of the dough.  Sift the remaining flour
  onto a wood or marble surface. Make a well in the middle;  pour a
  little water into it and begin working the flour towards this with
  your hands. When the dough has absorbed enough water to bind
  together, add the yeast dough and work in. Knead for 5-10 minutes,
  occasionally lifting the dough and smacking it on the table.
   Continue until it no longer sticks to your hands. Sprinkle a large
  bowl with water and put the dough into it. Cover with a cloth and let
  rise until doubled in size (about 30 minutes).  Knead again 5-10
  minutes and form into two balls.  Let stand another 20 minutes, and
  then bake on a greased, floured baking tin until crusty (about 30
  minutes) in an oven preheated to 350.

 Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 qt Hot water
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 tb Salt
    3/4 lb Fresh fettucini (1/2 lb dry)
    1/2 lb Unsalted butter
  2 1/2 c  Heavy cream
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
    3/4 c  + 4 tsp. Parmesan cheese
  1 3/4 c  Very fine dry bread crumbs
  1 1/2 tb Minced fresh parsley
  1 1/2 tb Olive oil
    3/4 ts White pepper
    1/2 ts Onion powder
    1/2 ts Garlic powder
      3    Eggs
      6    4 oz slices white veal (note
           Vegetable oil for pan frying
 
  NOTE:  You will need 6, 3-1/2 to 4 ounce slices of baby white veal,
  pounded thin for this recipe.
     Place the water, the 2 tablespoons oil and the salt in a large pot
  over high heat; cover and bring to a boil. when water readdds a
  rolling boil, add small amounts of fettucini at a time to the pot,
  breaking up oil patches as you drop it in.  Return to boiling and
  cook oncovered to al dente stage (about 3 minutes if fresh pasta, 7
  minutes if dry); do not overcook.
   during this cooking time, use a wooden or spagheti spoon to left
  fettucini out of the water by spoonfruls and shake strands back into
  the water. (It may be an old wives' tale, but this procedure seems to
  enhance the pasta's texture.)  Then immediately drain in a colander
  and stop its cooking by running cold water over strands (if you used
  dry pasta, first rinse with hot water to wash off starch); after it
  has cooled thoroughly, about 2 to 3 minutes, pour a liberal amount of
  vegetable oil in your hands and toss fettucini.  set aside still in
  the colander.    Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-low
  heat; add the cream and cayenne pepper. Turn the heat to medium-high.
  with a metal whisk whip the cream nmixture constantly as it comes to
  a boil.  the reduce heat and simmer until the sauce has reduced some
  and thickened enough to coat a spoon well, about 7 to 8 minutes,
  whisking constantly.  Remove from heat and gradually add 3/4 cup of
  the parmesan, whisking until cheese is melted. Set aside.
     Heat 6 large serving plates in a 250F oven. In a shallow pan (cake
  and pie pans work well) combine the bread crumbs, parsley, olive oil,
  white pepper, onion and garlic;, mix well. In a separate pan beat the
  eggs well, then beat in the remaining 4 teaspoons Parmesan. Soak the
  veal in the egg mixture for at least 5 minutes, being sure to coat it
  thoroughly.
   Meanwhile, heat 1/4 inch oil to about 400F in a large skillett.
  Then, just before frying, dredge veal in the bread crumbs, coating
  well and pressing the crumbs in with your hands; shake off any
  excess. Fry the veal in the hot oil until golden brown, about 1
  minute per side. Do not crowd. (Change the oil mid-way through frying
  if the crumbs in the bottom start to burn.) Remove veal to a large
  platter and set aside.
      Reheat the cheese sauce over medium-high heat, whisking
  frequently. (NOTE:  If butter starts separating from the sauce, whisk
  in about 1 tablespoon cream or water.)  Add the fettucini and loss
  until tho9roughly coated and heated through, about 1 minute. Remove
  from heat and serve immediately.    To serve, place a piece of veal
  on each heated serving plate.  roll each portion of fettucini onto a
  large fork and lift onto the plate; Top the fettucini with additional
  sauce from the skillet. From Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen

      Title: PANEER
 Categories: Indian, Cheese
      Yield: 1 Piece
 
      5 c  Whole milk
  2 1/2 tb Lemon juice
 
  Bring the milk to a boil. As soon as it begins to bubble, pour in the
  lemon juice, stir once, and take the pot off the heat. Leave it for
  15 minutes. The milk will curdle and the curds will separate from the
  whey.
  
  Strain the curds through three layers of cheesecloth. Squeeze out as
  much whey as you can easily.  (Do not discard this whey. Refrigerate
  it and use it in cooking instead of water.) Tie up the curds in the
  cheesecloth, and hang the bundle to drip overnight.
  
  Next morning, remove the hanging bundle and untie it. Gently flatten
  it out to make a 4-inch patty, keeping the cheese loosely wrapped in
  the cheesecloth.  Put the patty on a sturdy plate and place a flat,
  heavy object, such as a heavy pot filled with water, on top of it.
  Leave the weight on the cheese for 4 to 5 hours. After the cheese has
  been pressed, it should be 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick.
  
  Remove the cheese from the cheesecloth and, with a sharp knife, cut
  into cubes, diamonds, or rectangles. The paneer will be quite crumbly
  until fried.

  1 1/2 qt Milk, whole
  1 1/2 c  Cultured buttermilk
 
  Pour milk into a heavy 4-quart saucepan. Bring to a boil over
  medium-high heat, stirring occasionally.
  
  Reduce heat to medium and stir in buttermilk.
  
  When the curds form a mass (you'll see a clear, pale-yellow whey
  surrounding the curds), remove pan from heat, Let stand, partially
  covered, for 10 minutes.
  
  Line a colander with a double layer of dampened cheesecloth. Set the
  colander in the sink or in a bowl if you wish to save the whey (see
  note).
  
  Gently pour the curds and whey into the cheesecloth.
  
  Gather together the corners of the cloth, give one or two twists, and
  tie with a kitchen twine.
  
  Hang the cheesecloth bag over the faucet and let the cheese drain for
  1 hour, or until it is as thick as yogurt (this is channa).
  
  If the weather is warm, leave the cheesecloth bag in the colander,
  set the colander on a plate to catch the drippings, and refrigerate
  until the cheese has thickened.
  
  Unwrap the channa and use immediately, or cover and store in the
  refrigerator for up to 4 days.
  
  Yields approximately 10 ounces.
  
  Note: Save the whey for making your next batch of paneer, use it for
  cooking lentils or pilafs, or add it to soups.
  
  Paneer cheese: Snugly wrap cheesecloth around the channa to form a
  "cake." Place on a cookie sheet, place another cookie sheet on top
  and add weights (for example, 2 or 3 large cans of tomatoes, 2 or 3
  bricks, a large pitcher of water). Let the cheese sit for 2 to
        4    hours.
  
  Use immediately, or cover and refrigerate for up to 5 days.
  
  Yields 8 ounces (1 cup).

           Stephen Ceideburg
      2 c  Basmati rice
      8 oz Paneer (see recipe)
      4 tb Light vegetable oil
    1/2 c  Cauliflower florets
      1 c  Diagonally sliced carrots
      1 c  Chopped red or green bell
           -pepper
      2 tb Cashew halves
      2 tb Raisins
      2    Bay leaves
      1    Inch piece cinnamon stick
      8    Whole cloves
    1/2 ts Black peppercorns
      3 c  Water
    3/4 c  Canned tomato sauce
      2 ts Salt
 
  In the traditional version of this dish, the rice, paneer and
  vegetables all cook together. I like the vegetables to remain
  crunchy, however, so I cook them separately, then stir them into the
  rice toward the end of its cooking time. Serve this subtle pilaf lamb
  chops or spicy stews.
  
  Wash rice thoroughly. Place in a bowl, cover with water and let soak
  15 minutes. Drain.
  
  Cut paneer into cubes. Brush with 1/2 tablespoon of the oil and broil
  2 minutes per side. Set aside.
  
  Heat remaining oil in a Dutch oven over medium high heat. Add
  cauliflower, carrots and peppers.
  
  Stir-fry for 5 minutes, or until edges of peppers start to brown.
  Remove with slotted spoon and set aside.
  
  Reduce heat to medium. Add cashews and fry until light golden; remove
  and set aside. Add raisins and fry until plump; remove.
  
  Add whole spices to the pan. Stir and cook 1 minute.
  
  Add rice, increase heat to medium-high, and stir fry until rice is
  well coated with oil and begins to glisten, about 5 minutes. Add
  water, tomato sauce and salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to
  low, cover, and simmer for 12 minutes. Uncover and gently stir in
  vegetables and paneer,
  
  Cover and cook 5 minutes longer.
  
  Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 10 minutes,
  
  Fluff rice gently with a fork and transfer to a serving dish. Garnish
  with fried raisins and cashews.

      Title: PANEER COOKING HINTS
 Categories: Indian, Info/tips, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Text Only
 
  Freshly made paneer is delicious and may be eaten immediately, without
  further preparation or adornment. However, in most recipes, paneer
  must be cooked before it is added to the other ingredients.
  
  Broiling, which is discussed in the story, is the method I prefer
  because very little oil is used.
  
  If you don't wish to broil the cheese, here are a few alternatives:
  
  TOASTER OVEN:  Grease a small baking tray with vegetable oil. Place
  paneer cubes on the tray and brush with oil. Bake at 400F until
  golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes.  Remove and use in any cooked
  paneer recipe.
  
  For a quick paneer curry, place cooked cheese cubes on a heated
  serving platter and pour your favorite curry sauce over them. Garnish
  with minced cilantro and serve.
  
  BARBECUE GRILL:  Prepare a charcoal fire to the gray-ash stage.
  Gently blow away the ash, leaving coals that glow cherry red. Cut
  paneer into 2-inch cubes.  Brush skewers and paneer cubes with
  vegetable oil. Thread evenly on skewers leaving 1/2-inch space any
  cooked paneer recipe.
  
  For, an exotic appetizer, sprinkle grilled paneer cubes with. lemon
  juice and ground cumin.  Place on a warmed platter and served
  immediately.
  
  SAUTE:  Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a heavy nonstick pan or wok over
  medium-high heat.  When oil is hot, add paneer cubes and saute until
  light brown, turning once. Carefully transfer to paper towels to
  drain. Tent with foil to keep warm until ready to use.  Use in any
  recipe calling for cooked paneer.
  
  NOTE:  A nonstick pan is essential; the paneer will break and crumble
  in any other pan.
  
  DEEP FRY:  Heat 6 tablespoons of vegetable or canola oil to 350F in a
  nonstick wok until hot but not smoking. Gently add Paneer cubes. Do
  not crowd. Fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 5
  minutes.
  
  Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Tent with foil
  to keep warm until ready to use.  Use in any recipe calling for
  cooked paneer.

      Title: PANEER PATTIES IN ORANGE PERFUMED CREAM SAUCE
 Categories: Indian, Desserts
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      2 c  Water
    1/4 c  + 1 tablespoon sugar
      1 qt Half-and-half
      1 tb Grated orange zest
      2 tb All-purpose flour
      8 oz Paneer (see recipe)
      2 tb Chopped unsalted pistachios
 
  Two 3-inch pieces gold or silver leaf (varak), optional (see note)
  
  This version of a popular Indian restaurant dessert sports a
  California touch - grated orange peel. You may add cardamom, saffron
  or rose essence if you prefer a classic Indian flavor.
  
  Combine water and 1/4 cups sugar in a medium saucepan; bring to a
  boil, stirring constantly, until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat and
  simmer for 12 minutes.
  
  Combine the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar, the half-and-half and
  orange zest in a heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and
  simmer until sauce is reduced by one third, about 30 minutes. Remove
  from heat and let cool.
  
  Meanwhile, mix together flour and paneer; knead until fluffy and
  thoroughly mixed, Form mixture into walnut-size balls and flatten
  into 1/4-inch thick patties.
  
  Working in batches, poach patties in simmering sugar syrup until they
  are firm, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn gently and cook 1 minute longer.
  
  Using a slotted spoon, transfer patties to a serving bowl. Pour in the
  cream sauce and remaining sugar syrup. Cover and refrigerate for 6 to
  8 hours, or until well chilled, (May be made up to 4 days ahead.)
  
  Just before serving, sprinkle with chopped pistachios and, decorate
  with gold leaf, if desired.
  
  Note: Gold and silver leaf is available at Indian markets and
  specially food stores.

           Chick-pea Flour Fritters

MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
      3 c  Cold water
           Salt to taste
    1/2 c  Chick-pea (garbanzo) flour
      2 tb Chopped fresh parsley
    1/3 c  Freshly grated parmigiano
           -opt
           Vegetable oil; for frying
 
  In a medium-size bowl combine the water and salt.  Add the flour
  slowly, mixing well with a wooden spoon or a wire whisk after each
  addition to prevent lumps.  When all the flour has been added, you
  should have a smooth batter.
  
  Pour the mixture into a medium-size saucepan and bring to a gentle
  boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Cook and stir for 12 to
  15 minutes. As it cooks, the mixture will thicken considerably. If it
  thickens too much, however, and sticks heavily to the spoon or the
  whisk, add a bit of cool water.  Just before removing it from the
  heat, stir in the parsley and parmigiano and mix energetically to
  incorporate. The mixture should have the consistencne of a
  medium-thick bechamel or a thick gravy.
  
  Pour the mixture onto a medium-size baking sheet.  Wet a spatula
  (keep a small bowl of cold water next to you to dip the spatula) and
  quickly spread the msiture evenly to a thickness of about 1/4 inch.
  Refrigerate, uncovered, for several hours or overnight, until it is
  very firm. When you are ready to fry, cut it into 2-inch squares.
  
  Heat one inch of oil in a heavy, medium-size skillet over medium
  heat. When the oil is hot, fry the _panelle_ a few at a time until
  they are lightly golden on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove with a
  sloted spoon and drain on paper towels.  Season with salt and serve
  while hot.

      1 c  Candied cherries
    1/4 c  Marsala
  3 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
    1/3 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      5 ts Quick-rising dry yeast
    1/4 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
    2/3 c  Unsalted butter, softened
    1/4 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Water
      1 ts Vanilla
      2    Eggs
      2    Egg yolks
      1    Zest of half an orange
    1/2 c  Nuts (pine nuts, walnuts,
           -or hazelnuts)
    1/2 c  Green candied pineapple
           -edges
      1    Powdered sugar for dusting
           -on the top
 
  An Italian Christmas is not complete without this high-domed cylinder
  of fruit-studded sweet bread. This recipe has an option of using the
  microwave to make the bread rise. Soak the cherries in the wine. In
  the processor bowl fitted with steel blade, combine flour, sugar,
  salt, yeast and nutmeg. Pulse to mix. Cut butter into pieces and
  arrange on the top. Pulse to blend so that it almost disappears. In a
  glass measure, combine the milk and water. Microwave on high about 40
  seconds (see power levels), then with a fork, whisk in the vanilla,
  eggs, and egg yolks. With the processor motor running, drizzle the
  liquids very slowly into the flour mixture processor. Process 60
  seconds. Add orange zest and pulse to mix. Transfer to large glass
  mixing bowl and cover loosely with plastic wrap. To use the microwave
  for bread rising, place the bowl in the microwave. Place an 8-ounce
  glass of water in the back of the microwave. Lower the microwave to
  low (see power levels). Place the dough in the microwave. Heat on low
  for 3 minutes. Rest for 3 minutes. Heat on low for 3 minutes longer.
  Rest for 6 minutes, or until the batter has risen to double in bulk
  and is bubbly and light. Or let the dough rise in a warm draft-free
  place about 45 to 60 min. When dough has doubled in bulk, stir the
  batter down, then stir in the cherry mixture, nuts and candied
  pineapple until well distributed. Grease generously and lightly flour
  two, 1-pound coffee cans. Cut a parchment or wax paper circle to fit
  the bottom of each can and add it, dusting and flouring it as well.
  Spoon the batter into the cans, filling about halfway. Press down
  slightly. Let rise in a warm, draft free place until nearly doubled
  in bulk, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 325 degrees.
  Just before popping it in the oven, cut an X in the tops of the
  loaves with a razor. Italian bakers put a blob of butter into the
  cut. Bake at 325 degrees for 1 hour, or until evenly browned and a
  skewer stuck in the center comes out clean. Remove immediately to a
  rack to cool, then 15 minutes later, slide the cakes out of the pans
  and lay them on their sides to continue cooling. Dust with powdered
  sugar while warm. When cooled, wrap in plastic to store.

    1/2 c  Warm water (105-115 F)
    1/2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour

MMMMM--------------------------DOUGH #2-------------------------------
  2 1/2 ts Dry yeast
      3 tb Warm water
           Dough #1
      2    Eggs (@ room temp.)
  1 1/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Unsalted butter, softened

MMMMM--------------------------DOUGH #3-------------------------------
      2    Eggs (@ room temp)
      3    Egg yolks (@ room temp)
    3/4 tb Honey
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
      1 ts Salt
           Dough #2
      1 c  Unsalted butter, softened
      3 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
    3/4 c  Flour for kneading dough

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Dark raisins
    1/3 c  Currants
    1/3 c  Dried cranberries
      1 c  Candied mixed peel
           Grated zest of 2 lemons
 
  Sponge/Dough #1: In a medium bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm
  water and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Add flour, and
  stir with a wooden spoon until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and
  let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.
  
  Dough #2 (When dough #1 has risen): In a large bowl, dissolve yeast
  in warm water and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Add dough
  #1 (it will have a very loose consistency) to the yeast mix and stir
  well. Add the eggs, flour, sugar and stir until well mixed. Cover the
  dough with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in vloume, about 1
  hour.
  
  Dough #3 (When dough #2 has finished rising): In a large bowl, combine
  eggs, yolks, sugar, honey, vanilla extract, and salt. Add dough #2,
  it will have a very loose consistency, and mix well. Add the softened
  butter, mix well.
  
  Add the 3 cups flour (1 cup at a time) and coninue stirring until the
  dough has a soft texture, like soft cookie dough. Turn out on a well
  floured surface and knead gently, adding the last 3/4 cup flour as
  needed. Knead until the dough is soft and smooth and holds it's
  shape. Be careful not to create lumps.
  
  Lightly butter a very large bowl, enough to allow the dough to triple
  in volume. Place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with the
  butter, cover with plastic wrap and let rise until tripled, about 3
  hours.
  
  Filling: (can be mixed while waiting for dough to rise): Mix raisins,
  currants and dried cranberries in a small bowl. Cover with warm water
  and allow to soften for 10 minutes. Drain and pat dry. Mix in the
  finely chopped peel and lemon zest. Set aside.
  
  When the dough has triple in volume, turn out on a lightly floured
  surface and pat down into an oval or rectangle about 1/2" thick.
  Sprinkle half the filling mix over the dough, and roll up jellyroll
  fashion along the long edge. Again pat down into an oval shape about
  1/2" thick and sprinkle the remaining filing mix over the dough. Roll
  up jellyrool fashion along the long edge.
  
  Divide the dough into 3 pieces; two pieces should be about 1/3 larger
  than the third piece. Butter the bottoms and sides of two 300g coffee
  cans and one 398ml can. Line the bottoms and sides with waxed paper.
  
  Gently roll the dough into balls and place the two larger pieces into
  the two larger cans and the small piece into the small can. Cover
  with plastic wrap and allow to double in volume, about 2 hours. Once
  the dough has risen, cut a small 'X' in the top of each loaf and bake
  in a preheated 400 F (200 C) oven for 10 minutes. Reduce temp. to 375
  F (190 C) for another 10 minutes. Again reduce the oven to 350 F (180
  C) and bake for 15 minutes loger for the small can and 30 minutes for
  the large cans; or until a wooden skewer comes out clean when
  inserted into the bread.
  
  Cool the breads in their cans on a rack for 30 minutes. Carefully
  unmold the breads and lay on their sides, on a rack, until cooled.
  Best eaten within 48 hours.
  
  NOTES: I baked this recipe in 5 1/2 " high clay flour pots lined with
  foil. The recipe filled two pots. I baked at 400 F for 15 mins. then
  turned the oven down to 325 F for about 50 mins. The bread was done
  when a skewer came out clean. Make sure the butter is well softened
  or it will be almost impossible to mix in well.

           Confectioner's sugar
 
  Preheat the oven to 300º F. Sift flour with cocoa, cinnamon, and
  allspice. Mix in nuts and fruit. Set aside. Combine honey and sugar
  in a large saucepan. Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring
  constantly with a wooden spoon. Syrup should register 238º F. on a
  candy thermometer, or a bit dropped in cold water should form a soft
  ball. Remove from heat. Add flour mixture and blend well. Pour into a
  well-greased 9-inch pie plate or a spring-form cake pan. Smooth
  surface with a wet knife. Bake in a preheated 300º F. oven for 30
  minutes, or until firm. Remove from oven, sprinkle top with
  confectioners' sugar, and cool on a cake rack. When cake is cool,
  remove from pan and dust all sides with a thick coating of
  confectioners' sugar. Cut into wedges to serve.
  
  NOTES : Panforte has been made in Italy since the Middle Ages and is
  traditionally eaten at Christmas. This cake will keep indefinitely if
  wrapped well in foil or waxed paper and kept in an airtight container.

 Categories: Seafood, Appetizers, Foreign
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Shrimp (26 to 30)
      2 c  Panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)
      1 c  Flour
      2    Eggs
           Oil for frying
      1    Lemon
 
  Soy sauce for dipping
  
  Peel and devein shrimp,but leave tails attached.Wash well in salted
  water until water runs clear.This will be 5 or 6 changes of water.Dry
  on paper towels. Beat eggs in a bowl.Pour flour and panko onto
  separate pieces of waxed paper. Holding a shrimp by the tail,roll it
  in the flour,egg and panko. Place on cookie sheet.Repeat with
  remaining shrimp.This may be done several hours in advance,but keep
  them in the refrigerator. Heat oil in a pan to 350 degrees.Deep-fry
  shrimp until they turn light golden brown.You may need to do this in
  several batches,because if you crowd out the pan,they will not brown
  properly.Drain on paper towels. Cut lemon in half lengthwise,cut each
  half in half.You will have 8 long wedges.Serve with soy sauce to dip
  and lemon on side.You can squeeze the lemon either on the shrimp or
  in the soy sauce or both.
  
  Note:The Japanese eat a lot of foods at room temperature and fried
  food coated with panko stays crisp for several hours,hence it is good
  picnic food.This dish is served as an appetizer course in a Japanese
  meal but would also make a good hors d'oeuvre at a Western-style
  party.

  topping.  Place the broiler pan in the oven about 6 inches away from
  the flame and broil for up to a minute. The fat content is so high
  here that you shouldn't leave the fish alone.  They will cook quickly
  and there is always the potential for burning.
  
       Serve hot on a plate garnished with lemon wedges and parsley.

      Title: PANNEKOEKEN (DUTCH PANCAKES)
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           -==========================
 
  Ingredients:
  
  500 gr   wheat flour 1 l milk 4 medium eggs 1 tsp salt
        1    tblsp oil 1 tsp sugar It can be hand mixed or put in a
  blender. For a blender, combine all ingredients and blend. Hand
  method: Put flour in a bowl, make a little hole in the middle. Pour
  in some milk in the hole and start stirring. gradually pour in all
  milk, making a smooth batter. mix in the eggs, one by one, add salt,
  sugar and oil and mix again until the batter is smooth and not lumpy.
  The pancakes should be baked in a large wide frying pan (a french
  crepe pan is ok too) preferably in butter (or oil, if you don't like
  cholesterol). The butter should be very hot. Pour in some batter
  (about 2 or 3 tabelspoons) and bake.  Turn the pancake when the upper
  surface is dry and bake the reverse side for approx. the same amount
  of time.
  
  You can use anythind you like as a filling, use your imagination.
  Savoury pizzatype fillings are nice and can be put on top of the
  pancake after it's baked.
  
  Classic fillings are bacon and syrup pancakes and apple pancakes. For
  the baconpancakes you have to fry the bacon first and then pour over
  the batter.  They are served with dutch syrup, which has a thicker
  consistancy than american syrup.  Here in Australia they sell cane
  molasses, and that tastes almost the same as dutch pancake syrup.
  
  Apple pancakes the same : first bake some fine chunks of apple and
  pour over the batter.  These pancakes are great with applesyrup, but
  I'm not sure that't available in the States. Normal syrup or sugar
  and cinnamon will do as well I reckon.
  
  My favourite is a pancake with bacon and salami and syrup, but I think
  that's an acquired taste.

  General Instructions for Panzerotti
  
  1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees for 30 minutes.
  
  2. Roll the dough of your choice out to an even 1/8 inch thickness
  with a rolling pin.  If necessary, use dustings of flour to prevent
  the dough from sticking.
  
  3. Cut out as many panzerotti as possible using a 3 inch glass as a
  cutter.
  
  4. Combine all of the ingredients together in a bowl for any of the 6
  filling suggestions.
  
  5. Put a scant teaspoon of filling on one half of each of the circles
  of dough. (There will be leftover filling if using Roman Pepper
  Pastry Dough; use it in an omelet.)
  
  6. Fold the dough over into little crescent shapes, pressing down to
  seal the edges with your fingers. Place each one on an oiled baking
  sheet.
  
  7. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until lightly colored. Or deep-fry
  in 2 inches of vegetable oil until golden. Panzerotti are best served
  piping hot.
  
  Freezing Panzerotti
  
  Freeze the raw panzerotti in one layer on a baking sheet. Once they
  are frozen solid, they can be transferred to plastic bags. The can be
  frozen up to
        4    months.
  
  Reheating Panzerotti
  
  To reheat Panzerotti,simply put them on a baking sheet and warm them
  up in a 350 degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes.
  
  To bake frozen panzerotti, preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Lay the
  panzerotti on a baking sheet and cover them tightly with aluminum
  foil. Bake for 15 minutes. Then remove the foil and continue baking
  until turnovers are golden brown.

      3 c  Red onions
      6 c  Sour cream
      2 tb Salt
      3 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Fresh dill weed- chopped

  This is from Alice Brock at Alice's Restaurant.  Yes, THAT one.
  
  Peel and slice cucumbers as thin as you can.  Peel and slice red
  onions thin as you can.  (It's easier if you cut the onion in half
  and slice cut side down)
  
  Use a deep 1 gallon bowl or crock.  Alternate layers of cukes and
  onions with sprinkles of the salt and sugar between each layer. This
  will draw out the juices that make it soup. Pile sour cream on top.
  DO NOT STIR. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours or more.
  
  To serve, add the fresh dill weed and lemon juice and stir it up. Add
  more lemon juice or sugar to taste.
  
  Cool and refreshing, this is just perfect when it is too hot to cook,
  and cucumbers are running wild.

      Title: PAPAS FRITAS CON RAJAS (POTATOES FRIED WITH C
 Categories: Mexican, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      8    Chiles poblanos; roasted and
      2 tb Peanut oil
  1 1/2 md Onions; thinly sliced
      1 ts Salt
      2 lb Red bliss or other waxy pota
 
  This is an excellent accompaniment for roasted and broiled meats,
  especially if you want something more substantial than the rajas
  alone.
  
  I shall never forget the wonderful smell of the chiles frying as we
  would walk in very hungry at lunch time. Sometimes our maid Rufina
  would use strips of the long, thin, dark green chile chilaca, which
  can bite your stomach as well as your mouth quite fiercely.
  
  Cook the potatoes but be careful not to cook them too much; they
  should be al dente, or they will disintegrate during the frying.
  
  Remove the seeds and veins from the chiles and cut them into strips
  about 1 1/2 inhes long and 1/2 inch wide. If the chiles seem too
  picante, soak them in salted water for about 30 minutes.
  
  Heat the oil and fry the onions gently, without browning them, until
  they are soft.
  
  Add the chile strips, potatoes, and salt to the onions in the pan.
  Without coverint the pan, fry the potatoes until theyare nicely
  browned, stirring the mixture from time to time, as the chile and
  onions are apt to stick to the bottom of the pan.

  Look for medium-sized papaya (slightly larger than a pear) with
  smooth, unbruised skin, and a fruity aroma. Best time is May and
  June. Dark spots on the skin are a bad sign and will cause a bad
  flavor (check stem for decay and softness). Cut papaya in half,
  remove seeds, and peel skin. Cut in medium chunks and place in vodka
  with lemon peel(twist to release flavor). Let steep for 1 week.
  Strain and squeeze fruit, extracting juice. If desired, add sugar
  syrup. Store for 3 weeks. Yield: 1 pint Container: quart jar

      1 tb Ground cinnamon
      1 tb Ground nutmeg
      1 tb Ground pumpkin pie spice
    1/2 lb Brown sugar
      1 c  White sugar
      3    Eggs, beaten
      1    9" Pre-made pie shell
           -(Graham cracker shell)
 
   Cut fruit meat from skin; cut fruit into chunks. Add sugars, let set
  10-15 minutes. Place sugared fruit in a pot large enough to handle,
  cook over medium heat until fruit is tender and is easily broken into
  smaller pieces, about 30 minutes. Stir occassionally, to keep papaya
  from sticking. Add spices about halfway through the cooking process.
  When papaya is cooked, allow to cool about 15 minutes, add the beaten
  eggs, and place in the pie shell. Bake at 350 deg F for about 45
  minutes.
    Taste and is similar (sorta) to pumpkin pie.... my opinion. Filling
  is similar to the sugary part of pecan pie.

      Title: PAPAYA-CREAM CHEESE TART WITH MACADAMIA NUTS
 Categories: Other sauce
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 c  Flour
      6 oz Very cold unsalted butter --
    1/2    -inch cubes
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/3 c  Cold water
     12 oz Cream cheese
      4 oz Heavy whipping cream --
           Whipped to soft peak
    1/2 c  Powdered sugar
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract
      1    Very ripe papaya, peeled --
           Cut in 1/4" slices
    1/2 c  Peach glaze, melted
    1/2 c  Macadamia nuts -- toasted
      8 oz Bitter chocolate
      8 oz Semisweet chocolate
  2 1/2 c  Heavy cream
      4 tb Warm water
 
  STEP ONE: Prepare the Tart Shell-- Sift together the flour, salt, and
  sugar. Coat butter cubes with the flour mixture and water and knead
  until malleable, but not homogeneous. (The amount of water given is
  approximate; adjust the amount used according to the dough's
  consistency.) Leave bits of plain butter, otherwise the dough becomes
  too elastic. Gently roll dough to 1/4-inch thickness and lay onto a
  tart pan. Trim edges and poke bottom of pastry with a fork. Bake in
  oven at 350 degrees F for about ten minutes or until tart shell
  browns slightly. Chill.
  
  STEP TWO: Prepare Cream Cheese Filling-- Whip whipping cream until it
  forms soft peaks. In a mixer, beat cream cheese until it becomes
  fluffy. Fold in whipped cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract.
  Set aside.
  
  STEP THREE: Assemble Tart-- Fill tart shell with cream cheese mixture.
  Arrange papaya slices in a pinwheel design over the top of the cream
  cheese. Place macadamia nuts in center of tart. With a pastry brush,
  coat top of tart with peach glaze. Refrigerate for 1/2 hour before
  serving.
  
  STEP FOUR: Prepare Chocolate Sauce-- Heat bitter chocolate, semisweet
  chocolate, heavy cream, and warm water in a saucepan, stirring
  frequently, until sauce is a smooth consistency.
  
  STEP FIVE: To Serve-- Slice tart into 8 pieces. Drizzle chocolate
  sauce onto plate and place one piece of tart on each plate.

  into the oil.  Deep-fry 4 minutes on each side. Put packages in a
  strainer to drain off excess oil before serving.
  
  NOTE: Paper Wrapped Chicken may be deep-fried several hours in
  advance and reheated in the oven (325 degrees) for 10 minutes just
  before serving. 1. Brush center of the paper with oil, and with one
  corner of the paper toward you, place 1 piece of chicken and 1 sliver
  of green onion about 2" from that corner.
  
  2. Fold the corner to just cover the chicken.
  
  3. Fold once more...about 1 1/4," and tuck second edge under meat
  (This forms a triangle.)
  
  4. Make an envelope by folding the left and right corners toward the
  middle.
  
  5. Tuck in the flap to close the envelope.

  Pound the chicken breasts to 1/4 inch thickness. Reserve 8 perfect
  mango slices for garnish. In a blender or food processor, whirl
  mangoes (including syrup) with orange juice, garlic and salt. Set
  aside. Heat oil in saute pan. When hot, dip chicken breasts in
  seasoned flour -- be careful to shake off excess flour -- and place
  them in the hot pan. Saute chicken, for approximately 2 minutes per
  side. Add butter and mango puree to the pan. Cook until the sauce is
  reduced and fairly thick -- about 2 minutes. With a spatula, remove
  the mango-covered chicken breasts from the pan and place them on a
  hot platter. Spoon remaining mango puree over the chicken. Sprinkle
  with toasted almonds. Garnish each breast with 2 mango slices. For a
  more pronounced mango flavour, use fresh mangoes. Use 2 fresh mangoes
  and 1/2 cup of orange juice. Boil for 1 minute. From owner-chef Barry

 Categories: Pasta, Afghani
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  3 1/2 c  Flour, all purpose
      2 lg Eggs
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Oil, olive
    3/4 c  Water, warm (approximately)
 
  For Pasta:
  
       Place 3 cups of flour on your work surface.  Make a well in the
  center of the flour.
  
       Beat the eggs together with the salt and pour into the flour
  well.

  flour.  When about half of the flour has been incorporated, drizzle 1
  teaspoon of olive oil over the egg-flour mixture and stir it in.
  
       Use a little of the remaining 1/2 cup of flour to rub any sticky
  bits from your fingers.  Continue to add the unincorporated flour
  alternately with warm water, until you have worked in all of the
  flour and just enough water to form a mass that is supple but not
  sticky.
  
       Knead the mixture until very smooth and silky (about 10 minutes)
  adding flour if it becomes sticky, or a little warm water if it
  becomes too firm. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 sm To medium-sized duck, cut
           -into small serving pieces
           Salt and pepper
      2 c  Boiling water
     10    Dried shiitake mushrooms
      2    Onions, chopped
      2 tb Olive oil
      4 oz Pancetta, diced (prosciutto
           -or other full-flavored
           -ham may be substituted)
      3    Garlic cloves, chopped
      1    Carrot, diced
      6    Sage leaves
      1    Sprig rosemary
      1 c  Dry red wine
      1 c  Beef broth
      2 tb Tomato paste
    1/4 ts Fennel seeds
      6    Kale leaves, or outer
           -cabbage leaves
      2 c  Cooked, drained cranberry
           -beans or borlotti beans
      1 lb Pappardelle
           Freshly grated cheese,
           -to taste
 
  Sprinkle duck generously with salt and pepper, prick the skin well
  with a fork (this helps the fat to drain out), then place in a
  roasting pan and roast, uncovered, in a 350 degree oven about 45
  minutes. Pour off fat from pan once or twice during cooking, and
  discard. Meanwhile, pour the boiling water over mushrooms. Cover and
  let rehydrate. Set aside. Lightly saute onion in olive oil with
  pancetta, garlic and carrot until onion is softened, then add half of
  the sage and the rosemary. Pour in half of the wine; boil down until
  reduced by about half, then add remaining wine and half of the broth.
  Continue to boil down for about 5 minutes, then add tomato paste and
  fennel seeds. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes over low heat. When
  duck is cool enough to handle, remove skin and bones. Cut meat into
  bite-sized pieces and add to sauce. Blanch the greens quickly in
  boiling water, drain and run under cold water. Cut into bite-sized
  pieces. Add to the simmering sauce, along with the beans. Pour all
  the fat out of duck-roasting pan. Place pan over medium heat and add
  remaining broth, stirring to incorporate any full-flavored bits. Add
  this liquid to the simmering sauce, along with remaining sage leaves.
  Remove mushrooms from their soaking liquid, discard stems, and slice
  caps; add to sauce. Strain the mushroom-soaking liquid through a
  double layer of cheesecloth or a paper coffee filter, and add to the
  sauce. If the sauce is too thin, strain into a saucepan and boil down
  until reduced in volume and intensified in flavor. Return to sauce
  solids. Cook pappardelle until al dente, then serve with the sauce.
  Sprinkle cheese on top. Serves 4 to 6.

      Title: PAPRIKA CHICKEN
 Categories: Hungarian, Chicken, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Chicken, 8 to 10 pieces
      2 tb Oil
      1    Onion grated
      1 tb Paprika
           Salt
      2    Tb to 3 tb tomato puree
 
  Wash and dry the chicken pieces.  Heat the oil in a pan, add the
  grated onion and brown.  Add the paprika and when it bubbles put in
  the chicken pieces.  Turn them over in the onion-paprika mixture.
  Salt them and cover. Braise over a low heat, turning the chicken from
  time to time, for 45 minutes to 1 hour.  The chicken will exude its
  juices and if the sauce is still rather runny when the chicken is
  cooked, add the tomato puree and stir.  Cook a little longer and
  serve.

 Categories: Ethnic
      Yield: 7 Servings
 
      1 tb Lard, freshly rendered or
           -oil
  1 1/2 tb Hungarian paprika, or more
           -to taste
      1    Garlic clove, peeled,
           -chopped
      1 c  Anaheim green peppers,
           -seeded, chopped
           -or:
      1 c  Cubanelle peppers, chopped
      1 c  Yellow onion, peeled,
           -chopped
    1/2 c  Tomatoes, ripe, chopped
      1 ts Chicken base, knorr prefered
           - or chick bouillon
      6 c  Beef stock
           Salt to taste
           Pepper to taste
      1 c  Sour cream
    3/4 c  Flour, all-purpose
 
      Heat a 5 qt heavy stove-top casserole and add the lard and
  paprika. Cook over medium heat for a moment and then add the garlic,
  green pepper, onion, and tomatoes. Simmer for a few minutes until all
  is tender. Add the chicken base and Beef Stock, along with the salt
  and pepper. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
      In a metal bowl, mix the sour cream and flour together. Mix it
  well with a wire whip as you do not want lumps. Add a cup of the
  gravy from the pot and quickly stir into the cream and flour with the
  whisk.
      Remove the gravy from the heat and stir in the cream mixture,
  whipping it well. Return to the heat and simmer, stirring often, for
  15 minutes. Strain the gravy and discard the solids ... or lumps, if
  you have any. Yields: 7 cups Hint: To render lard.
      Yes, I know this is heresay in our time, but if you want the real
  flavor of Grandma's cooking you must render your own lard. Lard
  purchased from the market is not as flavorful.
      Tell your butcher you want fresh pork fatback, coarsely chopped,
  for rendering. Get 2 or 3 pounds. Place in a heavy kettle and add 1
  cup of water. Set over medium heat until all is boiling and then
  reduce heat to medium low. Cook until the pork fat pieces have shrunk
  to small toasty bits and the fat is clear yellow, about 2 hours.
  Allow the fat to cool and store it in glass jars in the refrigerator.
  Hint: On the use of lard.
      I have very mixed feelings about fooling around with Grandma's
  recipes. Where she used lard, you and I should certainly feel free to
  substitute some other kind of oil... but we must admit that the final
  flavor will not be the same. Perhaps we should have it just once in a
  while. Recipe & Hints Source: The Frugal Gourmet On Our Immigrant

      2 ts Lemon juice
      2 c  Vegetable stock or water
    1/4 c  Parsley, fresh

  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich dill, paprika and mushroom soup -- I first saw this at "Old
  Wives Tale," a restaurant in Portland, Oregon. The waiter there said
  that this had been on the menu every day for a year, and highly
  recommended it. The soup was delicious. I was pleasantly surprised to
  find a recipe for it in Molly Katzen's "Moosewood Cookbook." Yield:
  Serves 3-4.
  
  *  Tamari is a kind of soy sauce; if you can't find it, you can use
  ordinary soy sauce.

 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------------INGREDIENTS-----------------------------
      1 lg Spanish onion finely chopped
           A tad of oil or shortening
      3 lb Cut up chicken
           2-4 tablespoons Hungarian
           -Paprika *
      1 sm Container sour cream
 
  Directions: In a pot or pan large enough to hold the chicken
  comfortably, saute the chopped onion in a small quantity of
  shortening until onion is glassy in appearance. Add paprika to taste
  and color (I use about 4 tablespoons).  Add chicken.  Salt to taste -
  about 1-2 teaspoons. Cover and simmer over slow flame until chicken
  is ready to fall off the bone. If the juice released from the onion
  seems not to be enough, and the chicken is in danger of burning, add
  a touch of water - but try to cook slowly enough so that you do not
  have to add water. When the chicken is tender, remove from pan with a
  slotted spoon and set aside. Pour onions and juices into a blender
  and blend until smooth. If you are a stickler for tradition, put mix
  through sieve instead. Pour back into pan. Stir in 1/2 to whole
  container of sour cream (to taste), stirring well. Bring to light
  boil, and return chicken to pan, and let simmer for about 10 minutes.
  Serve with noodles, spatzle (traditional) or rice. Chicken Paprikas -

  for 20 min., turning them several times. Now add the heavy cream,
  blending into the sauce by tipping the skillet back and forth. Simmer
  all together until the sauce thickens a little. Remove from fire and
  skin each quarter carefully. Drain the sauce into a bowl, forcing the
  onions through a sieve. Wash the skillet so that no particles remain.
  (the sauce must be smooth and rich in texture and color.) Pour the
  sauce back in the skillet, taste for flavor and add more cream and
  paprika if desired. Stir away all lumps. Place chicken in the sauce,
  baste heat thoroughly without boiling. Serve on a hot round platter
  over a bed of buttered noodles or with a surrounding wreath of loose
  noodles or spatzle. Pour some of the sauce over the chicken & serve
  the rest separately. serves 6 Budapest Chicken Paprika -

      Title: PAR-COOKED BALTI MEAT (FROM CHAPMAN'S BALTI C
 Categories: Balti, Indian, Meats
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      6 lb Meat (lamb, beef, pork),
           -cut into 1/4 inch cubes,
           -weighed after cubing
      1 pt Stock or water
      4 tb Balti masala paste
 
  Preheat the oven to 375F. Bring the stock or water to the boil in a
  large lidded casserole dish. Add the meat and masala paste and
  simmer, stirring occasionally. Cover and put in the oven, and cook
  for 20 minutes. Inspect it and add water if needed.  Cook for another
  20 minutes and test the meat for tenderness: it should still "resist"
  a little and feel not quite ready. If it's reached this stage, remove
  the casserole from the oven, remove the meat, cool it, package it in
  plastic containers or Ziploc bags, and freeze: or refrigerate until
  needed (if you're going to need it in no more than 8 hours). Reserve
  the stock: it too can be frozen and added to Balti sauce or curry
  sauce as desired.

      Title: PAR-COOKED BALTI MEAT (FROM LOWE & DAVIDSON'S
 Categories: Balti, Indian, Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Boned lamb, cut into 1-inch
           -cubes
      2    Onions, chopped
      3 tb Vegetable oil
      2    Small tomatoes, chopped
      5 ts Balti spice mix
      2 ts Turmeric powder
    1/2    Green pepper, seeded and
           -chopped
      1    1-inch cube fresh ginger,
           -peeled
    1/2 ts Chili powder
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Garam masala
 
  Preheat the oven to 200C/400F.  Fry the onions in the oil in a
  flameproof casserole until translucent.  Add all other ingredients
  except the meat, and 1/2 UK pint / 300ml water. Bring to a boil: add
  the meat.
  
  Put the casserole in the oven and braise the meat for 45 minutes,
  checking every 10 minutes to give it a stir and make sure there's
  enough water. When the meat is tender on the outside but still a
  little pink inside, take it out with a slotted spoon.  Let the
  contents of the casserole cool a little. Then empty the contents into
  a blender or food processor and liquidize. This becomes your basic
  Balti sauce, and should be the consistency of thick soup.
  
  The meat is now ready for its final cooking in the balti.

 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      3 ea California avocadoes
      1 ea Poblano chile
      2 ea Serrano chiles
      1 ea Small white onion
      3 ea Cloves garlic
      3 ea Juice of 2-3 lemons
    1/4 ts Powdered cumin
      1 ts Tabasco sauce
      1 ea Salt to taste
 
  Roast the poblano chile over a low flame (or under a broiler) until
  the skin begins to char and blister. Place in a paper bag and let set
  for a few minutes. While the poblano is 'steaming', mince the onion
  and place in a large bowl.  De-seed  and  scoop  out  the avocadoes,
  taking care to discard any brown portions Place the avocado in bowl
  with onion and pound into slightly lumby paste. Take the poblano
  chile out of the bag and peel it, removing the stem, seeds, and
  internal membranes. Remove the stem end of the serranos Peel the
  garlic cloves. Place the poblano,serranos, garlic, lemon juice,
  cumin, and Tabasco sauce in a blender and whizz until pureed. Add
  this to the avocado/onion mixture in the large bowl and mix
  thoroughly. The flavor blends better if the guacamole is left in the
  refrigerator for an hour or two before serving. There are at least as
  many variations of Guacamole as there are people who make it, but
  this version may offend some purists, hence the name. This recipe is
  the result of experimentation with the basic guacamole recipe.  I
  personally prefer more cumin in it, but you don't want the result to
  taste more like bean dip than guacamole. Never use Florida avocadoes
  for guacamole -- you'll get a watery green pulp.

 Categories: Soups, Lamb/mutton, Ayzeri
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Boneless lean lamb
           ; cut in 1" cubes
           Salt; to taste
           Pepper, black; to taste
      3 tb Butter
      1 md Onion, finely chopped
      4 c  Beef broth
      1 md Potato, peeled and cubed
      1 sm Quince; peeled/cored/cubed
    1/2 c  Dried pitted prunes
           OR 1 c fresh sour prunes
    1/4 lb Chestnuts, shelled & peeled
    2/3 c  Canned chick-peas*
           ; drained & rinsed
      2 tb Ghi
 
  Season the lamb with salt and pepper.  In a heavy pot, melt the 3 tb.
  butter over moderate heat.  Add the lamb and onion; saute until
  browned, stirring frequently. Add the broth; season to taste with
  salt. Cover; simmer 30 minutes.
  
  Add the potato, quince, prunes, and chestnuts.  Cover; simmer 20
  minutes. Add the chick-peas and simmer, covered, about 15 minutes or
  until done. Stir in the clarified butter and allow to melt before
  serving soup.
  
  Note:  1/4 tsp. ginger or a pinch of powdered saffron dissolved in 2
  tb. warm water may be added with the chick-peas, and the soup served
  sprinkled with 1 ts. crushed dried mint, accompanied by chopped onion
  and sumakh on the side.  In the Caucasus, ground kyurdyuk is normally
  used instead of the clarified butter, and dried chick-peas* rather
  than canned ones. The dried chick-peas are soaked several hours,
  drained, and added at the beginning with the broth.
  
  Personal note:  I've found sumakh (labelled as sumac, a spice
  mixture) at Middle Eastern groceries.
  
  The author describes this soup as an "outstanding" Azerbaidzhani soup.

      2 ea Large carrots, peeled
      2 ea Stalks celery
      1 ea Large onion
      2 ea Large eggs
    1/2 c  Cooking oil -OR-
      1 x  1/2 cup melted "Nyafat"
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts White pepper
      2 tb Paprika
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a medium-sized mixing bowl, blend
  together the matzoh meal, flour and farina. Set aside. Dice the
  carrots, celery and onion into a blender container.  Add the eggs,
  oil, salt, pepper and paprika.  Blend until smooth. Combine the
  vegetable mixture with the dry ingredients in the mixing bowl. Blend
  well. Divide in half. Form the mixture into 2 rolls about 12 inches
  long and place each on a piece of very lightly greased aluminum foil.
  Wrap each roll in the foil securely. Place the rolls on a baking
  sheet. Bake for 45 minutes. Serve hot. NOTE: "Nyafat" is a brand name
  imitation schmaltz available in the kosher section of the
  supermarket. For those unfamiliar with it, it's an onion-flavored
  vegetable shortening and can be substituted for real schmaltz
  (rendered chicken fat). The advantages are (1) lower cost, (2) no
  cholesterol, (3) contains no animal products ("pareve").

    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Dried oregano
    1/2 c  Dry white wine or dry sherry
           Black pepper to taste
           -or dashes of Tabasco sauce

MMMMM--------------------TO COMPLETE THE DISH-------------------------
      2 tb Spanish olive oil
      4 md All-purpose potatoes,
           -peeled and sliced into
           -very thin rounds
           Salt
           Black pepper
    1/4 c  Parsley for garnish, chopped
 
   Rinse the fish in cold water, dry it well inside and out with paper
  towels, and place it in a large, shallow, nonreactive platter that
  fits it comfortably. Sprinkle it inside and out with salt, pepper,
  and lime juice. With a sharp knife, make 3 incisions, going right
  down to the bone, and insert a slice of lemon into each incision.
  Whisk together the oil and garlic and pour over the fish, rubbing it
  into the skin. Cover and allow to marinate in the refrigerator
  several hours or overnight.
    For the sofrito, heat the oil until fragrant in a skillet over low
  heat, then cook the onion and bell pepper, stirring, until
  transparent, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the tomatoes, olives, salt, oregano,
  and wine, and cook, stirring occasionally, 10 to 15 minutes. Season
  with pepper and set the tomato sauce aside. Just before serving,
  place the sauce over low heat for 8 to 10 minutes, until heated
  through.
    Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees and set the rack in the
  upper middle position. Rub the bottom of a large baking sheet with 1
  tablespoon of the oil, arrange the potato slices evenly on the baking
  sheet, forming a square, and season with salt and pepper. Place the
  fish on top of the potatoes and drizzle the remaining tablespoon of
  oil over it. Wrap the tail in aluminum foil and bake until the fish
  flakes easily,
       45    minutes.
    When the fish is done, carefully slide it onto a large, heated
  platter, remove the foil from the tail, and arrange the potatoes
  around the head and tail. Spoon the tomato sauce along the sides,
  sprinkle with the parsley, and serve. Makes 4 servings

           -small pieces
    1/2 c  Milk
      2 tb Spanish olive oil
      2 tb Salted butter
      1 sm Onion, finely chopped
    1/2 sm Green bell pepper,
           -seeded and finely chopped
      1 sm Tomato, seeded and
           -finely chopped
      1    Clove garlic, minced
    1/2 c  Minced baked ham
      3 tb Dry sherry
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce
      1 tb Finely chopped parsley
           Salt
           Black pepper to taste
    1/2 lb Small raw shrimp,
           -shelled and deveined
      1    Lobster tail simmered
           -in salted water to
           -cover over medium heat
           -until
           -cooked, about 5 minutes,
           -and sliced into 4 pieces
 
   Rinse the fish, pat it dry with paper towels, and place it on a
  nonreactive platter. Squeeze the lime juice over the skin, and rub
  the fish inside and out with garlic, salt, and pepper. Cover and
  refrigerate at least 1 hour.
   To prepare the stuffing, soak the bread in the milk in a small bowl.
  In a medium-size skillet over low heat, heat the oil and butter until
  fragrant, then cook the onion, bell pepper, tomato, garlic, and ham,
  stirring, until the onion is tender but not brown, 6 to 8 minutes.
  Add the sherry, Worcestershire, and parsley, mix thoroughly, remove
  from the heat, and allow to cool slightly. Squeeze the bread to
  remove the excess milk, stir into the mixture, and add salt and
  pepper.
   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Drain the fish and reserve the
  marinade (there will be a small amount). Stuff the fish with the
  stuffing mixture, arrange the shrimp and lobster slices on top of the
  stuffing, and sew up the pocket with needle and thread or secure with
  toothpicks or skewers. Transfer the fish to a shallow baking pan
  lined with well-oiled aluminum foil, allowing for enough overlap to
  pick up the fish. If the tail does not fit in the pan, wrap it in
  foil. Pour the reserved marinade over the fish, drizzle with a bit of
  oil, place in the oven, and bake, uncovered, until the fish flakes
  easily when pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. For an even crisper
  skin, place in a preheated broiler for the last 3 to 4 minutes of
  cooking time. Transfer the fish carefully to a serving platter,
  remove the thread, toothpicks, or skewers, and serve hot. Makes 4 to
  6 servings

      Title: PARKER HOUSE FISH CHOWDER~ BOSTON~ 1873
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
           See text
 
  "This recipe is unusual in two ways: it is remarkably 'dry,' and uses
  raw, rather than fried, onions.  When made with the liquid content
  called for, its consistency would be about that of corned-beef hash
  and it could be heaped up on a plate.  In the following conversion to
  a recipe for two persons, the liquid content is increased: 1 pound
  cod, haddock, or similar fish; 1 medium-sized potato; 1 medium-sized
  onion, 1/4 pound salt pork; 1 1/2 cups water; and 3/4 cup milk. Be
  sure that the flame is very low under the covered pot. Have a fresh,
  firm cod or haddock, a fish about 5 pounds is the best size.  Take a
  saucepan large enough to hold a little more than you wish to make.
  Cut salt pork in small squares about the size of dice, and fry quite
  brown.  Lay in the same pan alternate layers of thin, sliced potatoes
  first, then slices of fish, then broken water crackers, small fried
  pork, shreds of raw onion, black pepper and salt to suit the taste.
  Continue the layers until you have used up your material. Pour over
  it the pork fat from the scraps and half a pint of water, to keep
  from burning at the bottom.  Close the saucepan tight and set on the
  fire. Cook slowly, without stirring, for 45 minutes, when it is ready
  for the table. As some fish cook drier than others, if you do not
  find the chowder thin enough to serve well in a tureen, add some
  fresh milk just before taking up, and let it come to a boil."

      1 ts Olive oil
      1 ts Dijon mustard
      1 ts Salt
  2 1/2 lb Asparagus spears (medium)
      2 tb Grated parmesan cheese
 
  Stir together vinegar, oil and mustard in a large bowl. Set aside
  while cooking asparagus.
  
  Heat 2 in. water and half the salt to boiling in a large, deep
  skillet. Break or slice off the tough lower stems of the asparagus
  spears. Rinse and place half the spears in the boiling water. Cover
  and cook 5 to 6 minutes, or just until tender crisp.  Transfer
  asparagus with tongs or a slotted spatula to the bowl with the
  vinegar mixture.

  salt. Transfer to the bowl with the vinegar mixture. Toss gently
  until spears are evenly coated.

  parer instead of grating it.  If you like, garnish th platter with
  fresh orange sections.

  "Parmesan Crackers are great with a cold beer or soda. Once you have

  minutes Preheat the oven to 350~F. In a large bowl or in the food
  processor, cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles
  coarse meal. Add the cheese and egg yolk and mix well. Add enough of
  the water to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball.
  The texture will be somewhat crumbly, but the dough will hold
  together when pressed. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions for
  rolling. On a floured surface or pastry cloth, roll each into a
  rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Cut out individual crackers about 2
  inches across with a cookie cutter or sharp knife and arrange them on
  an ungreased baking sheet. Prick each cracker 2 or 3 times with the
  tines of a fork. Bake for 10 minutes. Turn the crackers over and bake

      2 md Tomatoes; thinly sliced
      2    Bn Arugula; large stems
           -removed
 
  In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup of the flour with the Parmesan, salt
  and pepper.  Make a well in the center and add the eggs and 1/4 cup
  of water. Beat the eggs and water together and gradually incorporate
  the flour mixture to form a smooth batter.  Add 1/8 teaspoon of the
  Tabasco and set aside to rest for 30 minutes. In another bowl,
  combine the mayonnaise, lemon juice, lemon zest, garlic, thyme, olive
  oil and the remaining 1/8 teaspoon Tabasco. Whisk to blend and set
  aside for at least 30 minutes. (The recipe can be prepared to this
  point up to 1 day ahead. Refrigerate the batter and mayonnaise. If
  the batter becomes very thick, thin it out with a little water.)
  Preheat the oven to 250F. In a large skillet, heat the peanut oil
  over moderately high heat to 350F. Dredge the crabs in the remaining
  1 cup flour and shake off the excess. Dip 4 of the crabs in the
  batter, let some of the batter drip off, and then fry them in the
  skillet, turning once, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
  Drain on paper towels, place on a heatproof platter and keep warm in
  the oven. Repeat with the 4 remaining crabs. Scoop out some of the
  bread from the center of the rolls to hollow them slightly. Spread 2
  heaping teaspoons of the mayonnaise on each half. Assemble the
  sandwiches by placing 2 or 3 slices of tomato and 4 or 5 arugula
  leaves on the bottom half of each roll. Set the fried crabs on top
  and close the sandwiches. Serve immediately. Serves 8. Recipe from
  Food & Wine, June, 1991.

      Title: PARSLIED BUTTERMILK BISCUITS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Flour; divided
      5 ts Baking powder
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      4 c  Shortening
      4 tb Parsley, fresh; chopped
      4 c  Buttermilk
 
  Preheat oven to 500F.  Lightly grease a large cookie sheet. Sift 1
  1/2 cups of the flour and the salt into a large bowl, setting remain-
  ing flour aside in a small bowl. Cut the shortening into the flour
  mixture with a pastry blender or a fork until the mixture resembles
  coarse meal; stir in the chopped parsley. Pour in the buttermilk all
  at once and stir with a fork until the mixture just holds together.
  Do not overwork; the dough should be wet and a little lumpy. Flour
  hands with reserved flour and pull of a 1/4 cup piece of wet dough.
  Toss the dough lightly in the bowl of flour to coat; roll gently into
  a smooth ball between palms of hands. The inside of the biscuit will
  still be very wwet; place biscuit carefully on the prepared cookie
  sheet. Repeat the procedure with the remaining dough, flouring the
  hands as necessary and placing the formed biscuits on the cookie
  sheet so they just touch.. Pat each biscuit gently to flatten
  slightly. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes until golden brown. Makes about 8
  biscuits. Nutrition Information per biscuit:

      Title: PARSNIP CHOWDER WITH SQUASH
 Categories: Soups, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Parsnips
      1 lb Butternut squash or sweet
           -potatoes
      4    Strips bacon
      1 md Onion, finely chopped
      2    Stalks celery, finely
           -chopped
      3 tb Flour
      5 c  Chicken stock
           Bouquet garni of bay leaf,
           -thyme and parsley
      1    Cinnamon stick
      1 c  Heavy cream
           Salt
           Freshly ground white pepper
           Cayenne pepper
           Freshly grated nutmeg
      3 tb Chopped fresh chives
 
  "Chowder originated as fish stew.  But in areas where seafood was
  unavailable, resourceful Americans used vegetables. This recipe comes
  from....Rich Spencer, a chef in the Mount Washington Valley."
  
  Peel the parsnips and squash (or sweet potatoes) and cut each into
  1/4 inch dice.  Cut the bacon into 1/4-inch strips and render it in a
  large saucepan. When the bacon pieces are lightly browned, transfer
  with a slotted spoon to paper towels to dry.  Discard all but 3
  tablespoons af the rendered fat.
  
  Add the onion and celery to the pan and cook over medium heat for 3
  to 4 minutes, until soft but not browned. Stir in the flour and cook
  for 1 minute to make a roux. Whisk in the chicken stock and bring to
  a boil: the mixture will thicken slightly.
  
  Add the bouquet garni, cinnamon stick, parsnips and squash. Simmer the
  chowder for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender but not
  soft.  Stir in the cream, salt, pepper, cayenne and nutmeg. Just
  before serving, remove the bouquet garni and cinnamon stick. Ladle
  the chowder into bowls and sprinkle each with chopped chives and
  nutmeg.
  
  Serves 6 to 8.

  1 1/2 tb Sour cream
    1/2 c  Water
  2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour, or more
           -as needed

MMMMM----------------------PIEROGI FILLING---------------------------
  1 1/2 lb Parsnips, peeled
      2    Shallots, peeled
      1 ts Unsalted butter
           Freshly grated nutmeg
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
      2 ts Freshly grated or prepared
           -horseradish
      4 oz Farmer cheese or goat cheese

MMMMM-----------------------SAUTEED APPLES----------------------------
      2 ts Unsalted butter
      2    Apples, peeled if desired,
           -cored, and thinly sliced
      3 ts Sugar
 
  1. To make red-cabbage slaw, whisk together vinegar, sugar, and
  caraway seeds in a medium bowl. Toss in cabbage. Season with salt and
  pepper. Let marinate for at least i hour, or up to overnight.
  
  2. To make pierogi dough, whisk together egg, milk, sour cream, and
  water. Stir in flour a little at a time until dough comes together.
  Turn out onto a lightly floured board and knead until smooth and
  elastic, up to 10 minutes. Incorporate more flour if dough is too
  sticky. Cover dough with plastic wrap and allow to rest for 1 hour.
  
  3. To make filling, place parsnips in a medium saucepan and cover with
  cold, salted water. Bring to a boil and simmer until tender, 20 to 25
  minutes. Drain and put through a food mill to puree.
  
  4. In a small saute pan, cook shallots in butter until soft, 1 to 2
  minutes. Stir into puree and add nutmeg, salt, and pepper to taste.
  Remove from heat and let cool slightly then mix in horseradish and
  cheese.
  
  5. On a lightly floured board, roll out dough to 1/8 inch. Cut out
  circles using a 3/4-inch-round cutter. Set circles aside on a floured
  tray. Place a round T of filling on each circle. Lightly wet edges,
  fold over, and seal by pinching.
  
  6. To make sauteed apples, heat a medium saute pan over medium-high
  heat. Melt butter, add apple slices, and toss to coat. Add sugar and
  toss again to coat evenly. Cook until brown, about 5 minutes.
  
  7. When ready to serve, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add
  pierogies and boil for 5 minutes after they float to the surface;
  drain. Pierogies can be eaten right away or browned in a small amount
  of butter. Serve with red-cabbage slaw and sauteed apples.

      Title: PART-BAKED ROLLS & LOAVES
 Categories: Bread, Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Rolls
 
  Both home-baked white and wheatmeal rolls can be frozen partly baked.
  This is a very successful way of freezing rolls as the frozen rolls
  can be put straight from the freezer into the oven to finish baking.
  It is the best method of freezing rolls to serve for breakfast.
  Loaves are not so successful as rolls because during part-baking the
  crust becomes well formed and colored before the center of the loaf
  is set. Part-baked loaves and rolls available in shops freeze well.
  
  TO PART-BAKE ROLLS:
  
  Place shaped and risen rolls in a slow oven, Gas No. 2 (300 degrees
  F/150 degrees C), for about 20 minutes. The rolls must be set but
  still pale in color. Cool.
  
  TO FREEZE:
  
  Pack cooled rolls in usable quantities in freezer bags. Seal and
  freeze. As the sides of the rolls are still slightly soft, care must
  be taken when packing to avoid squashing.
  
  STORAGE TIME:
  
  Up to 4 months.
  
  TO THAW AND FINISH BAKING:
  
  Unwrap and place frozen rolls in oven to thaw and complete baking.
  Bake white rolls at Gas No. 6 (400 degrees F/200 degrees C), brown

      Title: PARTRIDGE WITH MOLE SAUCE
 Categories: Game, Poultry
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      4    Partridges, about 1 lb. each
    1/4 c  All-purpose white flour
           Salt and freshly ground
           -black pepper to taste
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 sm Onion, chopped
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      3 tb Minced fresh cilantro
  1 1/4 c  Defatted chicken stock or
           -water
      2    Canned or fresh plum
           -tomatoes, coarsely chopped
      1    Bay leaf
    1/2 ts Dried thyme
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 c  Pepitas (green pumpkin
           -seeds)
    1/2    Dried mild dried pepper
      1    Chipotle pepper or to taste,
           -seeds removed
    1/2 oz Unsweetened chocolate,
           -chopped
 
  This is a strong sauce, but partridge is an intensely flavored bird
  and is equal to it. Serve with rice or soft flour tortillas. Note:
  Pasilla and ancho peppers can be ordered from Dean & DeLuca, 560
  Broadway, New York, NY 10012, (800) 221-7714.
  
  Tie partridge legs together and secure to the body with a toothpick.
  Combine flour, 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper in a shallow dish.
  Dredge partridges in flour mixture. Heat oil in a deep casserole with
  a lid over medium-high heat. Brown partridge in batches, turning, for
  about 5 minutes. Set aside. Add to the pot onions, garlic, 1 Tbsp.
  cilantro and 1/4 cup stock or water and cook for about 2 minutes, or
  until softened. Add tomatoes, bay leaf, thyme, cinnamon and remaining
  1 cup stock or water. Return birds to the pot, bring to a boil,
  reduce heat and cover. Simmer, basting occasionally, for 20 to 30
  minutes, or until the birds are tender and their juices run clear
  when they are pierced with a fork.
  
  Meanwhile, roast pepitas over medium heat in a small, dry skillet,
  stirring frequently, for about 3 minutes, or until lightly browned.
  Set aside. Roast pasilla and chipotle peppers in the same skillet for
  about 30 to
       40    seconds until fragrant.
  
  Remove birds from the casserole dish and cool slightly. With poultry
  shears, cut them in half, discarding the back bone. Set aside and
  cover with foil to keep warm. Boil the sauce over high heat for 5 to
  10 minutes, stirring often, until it has been reduced to 1 cup. Add
  pepitas, dried peppers and chipotles to the cooking liquid and cook
  for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove bay leaf and transfer the sauce to a
  blender or food processor. Add chocolate and blend until smooth. If
  the sauce seems too thick, add a little stock or water.
  
  Return the sauce to the casserole dish and heat through briefly over
  low heat. Taste for seasoning: it should be smoky, hot and slightly
  bitter. Nap the birds with the sauce and garnish with the remaining 2
  Tbsp. cilantro.
