      Title: Savory Chicken
 Categories: Mexican, Poultry
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3    Or 4 half chicken breasts,               Cut into pieces
           -boned and skinned,            
 
  Savory Chicken is so fast and so good you will just want to stand and eat
  it out of the pan.
  
  (Home Spice Blend: use approximately the measurements below for spices. For
  the spice blend, combine cumin, cayenne pepper, thyme, garlic and onion
  powders, salt and flour.  Increase the spice amounts if you are cooking
  more than 2 1/2 pounds of chicken.)
  
  1  tsp cumin powder 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper 1 tsp crushed thyme 1/2 tsp
  garlic powder 1/2 tsp onion powder 1/2 tsp salt 1 Tbs flour 2 Tbs butter 1
  or 2 cloves garlic, chopped 1 or 2 jalapeno chiles, seeded, minced 1/2 cup
  to 3/4 cup light beer This recipe doubles easily but don't try to saute the
  chicken all at once. After the chicken is skinned and boned, rub it with
  your home spice blend.  If you get inspired, add another spice. Let the
  spiced chicken sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes.
  
  Using a heavy 12-inch skillet, heat the butter and oil and add 1 cup of the
  chicken pieces at a time.  Saute over medium heat until golden. Remove to a
  plate.  Saute the rest of the chicken, adding more oil if necessary. When
  all the chicken is sauteed, drain off any excess oil. Put all the chicken
  pieces back in the pan, along with the chiles and garlic and add the beer.
  A great head of steam will rise up the the most wonderful aroma. Quickly
  now, clamp on the lid and turn the heat to low.  Check every 5 minutes and
  turn the chicken in the reducing broth.  Cook for about 15 to 18 minutes.
  If the broth cooks away toward the end of the cooking, just add a
  tablespoon more beer.  At the end you should be left with a nice thick
  glaze.  Push the chicken around the beer glaze so it all gets coated. This
  is about the best taco meat you will ever encounter. Since tacos are filled
  with other things, the recipe above will serve 4 people unless you ate too
  much out of the pan.

      6 oz Slice filet mignon, about 1              Sea salt
           -1/2 to 3 inches wide                    Freshly ground pepper
    1/8 ts Fresh lime juice,              
 
  Place the beef between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound, pushing it
  outward as you go, to a rough oval shape.  Fold into a package and pound
  out again to the required size.  Peel off the top plastic wrap and replace
  with wax paper.  Turn meat over and replace second sheet of plastic with
  wax paper; set aside until ready to use.
  
  Heat a griddle.  When very hot, grease lightly.  Remove top paper. Sprinkle
  the exposed side of the meat with lime juice and salt and pepper and lay it
  face down, with the aid of the paper, on the griddle. Strip off the bottom
  paper.  Cook for about 2 seconds, flip the meat over with two spatulas so
  it will not break in the middle, and cook for 2 seconds more. Serve
  immediately, flat if possible, on a large plate with refried beans, and
  fresh salsa of your choice.

      Title: Traditional Caramel Custard - Flan a la Antigua
 Categories: Mexican, Desserts
      Yield: 8 servings
 
           Jim Vorheis                         2    Inch cinnamon stick or
    3/4 c  Sugar                                    -vanilla bean
           The custard:                             Small piece of orange or
      1 qt Milk                                     -lemon rind (optional)
      1 pn Of sea salt                         4    Eggs
    1/2 c  Sugar                               6    Egg yolks
 
  The caramel: Heat the sugar for the caramel in a small, heavy frying pan
  over low heat until it begins to dissolve. Shake the pan slightly (do not
  stir) until all the sugar has melted.  Increase the flame and let the sugar
  bubble and color.  Pour the caramel into the mold and quickly turn it
  around in all directions, tipping it up in a circular motion until the
  surface - bottom and 2 inches up the sides - has been lightly coated with
  the caramel.  If the caramel thickens and becomes sluggish, gently heat the
  mold in a pan of hot water or over low heat, depending on the material, and
  continue the coating action.  Set aside to cool.
  
  Put the milk, salt, sugar, and cinnamon or vanilla into a saucepan and
  bring slowly to a boil, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Continue
  boiling slowly, taking care that it does not boil over, until the milk has
  reduced by about 2/3 cup.  Set aside to cool.
  
  Place an oven rack on the lowest rung of the oven and heat to 325 F.
  
  Beat the eggs and yolks together and stir into the tepid milk. Pour the
  mixture through a strainer into the flan mold and place it in a hot water
  bath in the oven.  Test after 2 hours with a skewer or cake tester; if it
  comes out quite clean, the flan is cooked. Remove from the oven, but allow
  to sit in the water bath for about 15 minutes longer. Remove and set aside
  to cool completely before refrigerating.

      1 c  Spinach leaves, shredded            2    Whole Serrano Chilies,
           Yellow Tomato Salsa:                     -seeded and minced
      4 c  Yellow cherry tomatoes or 1         2 ts Lime juice
           -lb yellow tomatoes                      Salt to taste
      1    Whole shallot, large, finely        1 tb Maple syrup (if tomatoes
           -minced                                  -aren't sweet)
 
  To make Yellow Tomato Salsa, in a food processor, using steel blade,
  process tomatoes until well chopped. Don't puree. Combine tomatoes and
  their juices with shallot, garlic, cilantro, vinegar, chilies, lime juice,
  salt, and mix well. Add maple syrup, if needed, to balance flavor and
  slightly sweeten. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until very
  cold.
  
  To make taco, fill large stock pot with lightly salted water and bring to a
  boil over high heat.  Add lobsters and cook for about 8 minutes or until
  just done. Drain and let lobsters cool slightly. Remove meat from lobster
  tails, careful not to tear it apart.  Cut meat into thin medallions (or
  medium size dice, if meat breaks apart).  Heat oil in medium saute pan,
  over medium heat and saute lobster medallions until just heated through.
  Spoon equal portions warm lobster medallions into center of each warm flour
  tortilla.  Sprinkle each with equal portions of grated cheese and shredded
  spinach.  Roll into cylinder shape and place each one on warm serving plate
  with the edge facing bottom. Surround the taco with Yellow Tomato Salsa.

      Title: Well-Fried Beans (Frijoles Refritos)
 Categories: Mexican, Beans
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 lb Beans, cooked (3-1/2 to 4                -used shredded Monterery
           -cups with broth)                        -Jack)
           A 10 inch frying pan               12    Totopos (fried tortillas, or
      6 tb Melted lard or pork                      -tortilla chips)
           -drippings                               Some romaine lettuce leaves
    1/4    Onion, finely chopped               6    Radish roses
      2 oz Queso fresco, crumbled (I      
 
  Heat the lard and fry the onion, without browning, until it is soft.
  
  Add 1 cup of the beans and their broth to the pan and mash them well over a
  very high flame. (With a bean masher or wooden potato masher) Add the rest
  of the beans gradually, mashing them all the time, until you have a course
  puree.
  
  When the puree begins to dry out and sizzle at the edges, it will start to
  come away from the surface of the pan.  As you let it continue cooking, tip
  the pan from side to side.  The puree will form itself into a loose roll.
  This will take from 15 to 20 minutes.
  
  Tip the roll, rather like folding an omelet, onto the serving dish and
  garnish with the cheese.  Spike it with the crisp triangles of tortillas.
  Decorate.

      Title: Scaloppine Di Vitello All'agro
 Categories: Italian, Meats, Veal
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Veal scaloppine                     1 tb Olive oil
    1/2 c  All-purpose flour                        Juice of 2 lemons
           Salt and freshly ground             3 tb Chopped parsley
           Pepper to taste                     2    Garlic cloves - chopped
    1/4 c  Butter                              2 tb Capers
 
   Place scaloppine between 2 pieces of waxed paper and pound until thin.
  When pounding meat do not use a straight up-and-down movement. Use a
  sliding action so meat is stretched more than flattened (I use the edge of
  a saucer for this).  Coat meat lightly with flour. Sprinkle with salt and
  pepper.  Melt 3 tablespoons butter with oil in a large heavy skillet. When
  butter foams, add veal.  Cook over high heat about 1 minute on each side.
  Veal should be light golden outside and pink inside.
   Place veal on a warm platter.  Add 1 tablespoon butter and lemon juice to
  skillet.  Deglaze skillet by stirring to disolve meat juices attached to
  bottom of skillet.  Stir in parsley, garlic and capers. Taste and adjust
  sauce for seasoning, then spoon over veal. Serve immediately.

      Title: Veal Scaloppine with Marsala
 Categories: Italian, Meats, Veal
      Yield: 2 servings
 
    1/2 lb Scallopine of veal, cut                  Freshly ground Pepper
           Into 1/4 inch slices                2 tb Butter
           Flour for dredging                  2 tb Olive oil
           Salt                              1/4 c  Marsala wine
 
  Unless the scaloppine are very small, cut them into pieces measuring ab. 3
  in. by 3 in or slightly larger.  Place them between sheets of wax paper and
  pound lightly to flatten.(use a rolling pin, bottom of a heavy skillet,
  pounder, etc.) Blend flour with salt and pepper to taste. Dip the meat into
  flour to coat lightly. Using a large, heavy skillet, heat the butter and
  oil and when it is very hot but not brown, add the meat in one layer. Cook
  over relatively high heat until golden brown on one side. Turn and cook
  until golden brown on the other. The cooking time should be from 4-6 min.
  Transfer meat to a serving platter or two plates and keep warm. To the
  skillet add the wine and stir to dissolve the particles in the pan. Reduce
  wine slightly and pour equal amounts over each serving. Naturally, these
  amts. may be increased to serve more people. For Chicken marsala, I don't
  see why you can't substitute chicken breasts.

      Title: Veal Marsala with Provolone
 Categories: Meats, Italian, Veal
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Veal cutlets                        4    Mushrooms, fresh, sliced
           Flour                             1/2 c  Marsala wine
           Salt & pepper                       4 tb Butter, cold
      2 tb Butter                                   Provolone cheese, sliced
      2 tb Olive oil                      
 
  Pound veal cutlets between sheets of waxed paper til about 1/4" thick.
   Combine flour and salt & papper to taste.  Dredge cutlets in the flour
  mixture.  Combine 2 Tbsp butter with the 2 Tbsp olive oil in a large frying
  pan over medium high heat.  Cook cutlets until lightly browned- about 2-3
  minutes per side.  Remove cutlets to a platter or pan suitable for use
  under a broiler.  Place sliced mushrooms in the frying pan and cook until
  tender, adding a little butter if needed. Add Marsala and reduce sauce to
  about half of the original volume. Pre-heat broiler. Lower heat under the
  frying pan to VERY low, or place pan in a larger pan of hot water. Whisk in
  cold butter, 1 Tbsp at a time, adding each just before the last is
  completely incorporated. Remove sauce from heat immediately when done.
  Place a slice of provolone on each cutlet and broil until cheese bubbles
  and just starts to brown. Serve sauce alongside the cutlets, or spoon over
  as they are served.  (This type of sauce will separate if it becomes too
  hot at any point- mine always does :) ).
  
  Other ideas:  Use chicken in place of veal.  Place a slice of prosciutto on
  the chicken or veal, then the slice of cheese before broiling.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      3 c  40% Bran Flakes cereal              2 tb Oil
    1/2 ts Orange or vanilla extract           9 oz Box yellow cake mix
  1 1/4 c  Hot milk                            3 ea Eggs
 
  Combine cereal with hot milk in a 1-1/2  quart mixing bowl and let  it
  stand about 10  minutes---or until the cereal has absorbed all of  the
  milk.  With the electric mixer on high speed, beat in the oil and eggs till
  completely blended.   Remove the beaters.   Switch to  a sturdy spoon and
  dump in the cake mix,  stirring only to moisten all of it thoroughly---but
  don't overmix or overbeat or the muffin texture will be heavy and tough.
  The batter will be a bit lumpy.
   Cover the bowl and let the batter stand 15  minutes while you preheat the
  oven to 400 F, and grease 12  muffin tin wells in Crisco, evenly. Divide
  batter equally between the 12 wells.  If you are using cupcake tin wells,
  you will have 15 muffins.   Bake at 400  for 20 to 25 minutes, or till
  golden brown. Wipe tops of each while still warm in softened butter or
  margarine.

      Title: Sourdough Chocolate Cake
 Categories: Breads, Chocolate, Cakes/choc.
      Yield: 12 servings
 
    1/2 c  Sourdough starter                   2 ts Baking soda
  1 1/2 c  All purpose flour                   1 c  Milk
      2 c  Sugar                             1/2 c  Vegetable oil
    3/4 c  Powdered cocoa (not instant)      3/4 c  Cold coffee
      2 ts Baking powder                       1 ts Vanilla
 
  Few people bake cakes from scratch anymore unless they can produce
  something that's not possible with a mix.  This sourdough chocolate cake
  falls in that category.  It's got a fudge-like quality you can't get any
  way except with sourdough and since it's all mixed in one bowl, it's almost
  as easy as a boxed cake.
  
  Put the starter in a large bowl, cover loosely and allow to stand at room
  temperature until active and bubbling -- at least one hour. Then add the
  rest of the ingredients, in the order given, beating well after each
  addition.  It is not necessary to sift or premix any of the ingredients as
  long as you are careful to get the baking powder and soda evenly mixed.
  
  Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, pour in the batter, which will
  be thin, and bake in a preheated 350. oven for about 30 minutes, or until
  the layers test done when poked with a toothpick. The cake will have pulled
  away from the sides of the pan.
  
  Allow to cool about 10 minutes before removing from pans, then finish
  cooling the layers on wire racks.  Do not frost until the cake is
  completely cold.
  
  A mild chocolate butter cream frosting is nice with this cake.

      Title: Pasta Dough (Manual Pasta Machines Only)
 Categories: Italian, Breads, Pasta
      Yield: 1 servings
 
  2 1/3 c  All purpose flour                   2 lg Eggs
           (for better pasta, use              1 tb Olive oil
  1 1/3 c  AP flour and                      1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Semolina flour)                   1/3 c  Water
 
  Mix 2 cups flour and salt in bowl, reserve 1/3 cup for later. Make a well
  in the center Mix eggs, olive oil and water and pour into well. Stir flour
  into egg mixture until dough forms into a ball. Turn out onto floured
  surface and kneed for about 10 minutes, adding extra flour if too moist.
  Kneed until dough is smooth and elastic. Cover with towel and rest for 30
  minutes. Cut into 4 portions, keep pieces covered until used.
  
  Get out your machine and set dial on widest setting (1 on the Atlas).
  Flatten dough ball and run through rollers several times until smooth (you
  may add a bit of flour here too). Move rollers to next setting and roll
  again once. Continue to roll until pasta is the proper thickness (5 or 6 on
  the Atlas).  You may cut sheet in half if it's too long. Continue with
  other pieces and then put the finished sheet aside to dry for about 3
  minutes.  Attach desired pasta cutters and run the sheets through.
  
  You can use right away or spread out the pasta to dry overnight and then
  freeze extra.
  
  To cook, drop into large pot of boiling water with a bit of salt and oil.
  Cook until al dente, which should only take about 2 minutes for fresh.
  
  A tip - be sure the dough is fairly dry, otherwise it won't cut into
  separate strands.
  
  Another tip - You can substitute heavy cream for the 1/3 c water for a
  richer pasta. Great for fettuchini alfredo.

  There's a bakery near me called Aunt Mary's (are you listening, Sallie?)
  and they have the most wonderful basil-parmesan scones.  One day I
  experimented and was pleased to find a pretty good facsimile.
  
  Just add the above ingredients along with all the other dry ingredients and
  proceed as above.  These are a nice change of pace from Italian or garlic
  bread.  Or cut with smaller cutter and serve as appetizer (don't forget to
  reduce baking time if smaller).

      Title: Friendship Cake and Starter
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lg Gallon Jar                          1 c  Sugar
      1 c  Cubed Pineapple                     2 tb Brandy
      1 c  Sugar                                    Cake:
      2 tb Brandy                              1    Box Cake Mix
      1 c  Maraschino Cherries                 1 sm Box Instant Pudding
           -including juice                  3/8 c  Cooking Oil
      1 c  Sugar                               4    Eggs
      2 tb Brandy                              1 c  Chopped Nuts
      1 c  Sliced Canned Peaches               1    Portion Fruit
           -including juice               
 
  In the one gallon jar, combine the pineapple, 1 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons
  of brandy. Let ingredients sit in jar for 2 weeks, stirring daily. At the
  end of two weeks, add the maraschino cherries, 1 cup of sugar and 2
  tablespoons of brandy. Let the mixture sit for two more weeks, stirring
  daily. During the forth week add the canned peaches, 1 cup of sugar, 2
  tablespoons of brandy. Let sit another two weeks, stirring daily. Seperate
  the liquid from the fruit. The liquid is your starter and you can use the
  fruit on ice cream or cake. Now you are ready to prepare the fruit for two
  cakes.
  
  DO NOT refrigerate the liquid. In a large gallon jar, put 1 1/2 cups of the
  starter, 2 1/2 cups of sugar and 1 large can (28 Oz.) sliced peaches. Mix
  well and cover jar with a paper towel. Do not refrigerate or screw lid on
  jar. Stir every day for 10 days. Next, add 2 1/2 cups of sugar and 1 can
  (16 oz.) crushed pineapple. Stir everyday for 10 days. Add 2 1/2 cups sugar
  and 1 can (16 oz.) fruit cocktail. Slice contents of 1 jar (10 oz.)
  maraschino cherries and add with juice. Stir every day for 10 days.
  
  On baking day, drain the fruit and divide it into two equal parts. Save the
  juice and use it as starter for friends. You will have enough for five
  starters (approximately 2 cups each). DO NOT refrigerate the liquid because
  it will stop the fermenting action. For each cake you will need: To each
  cake mix, add pudding mix, oil, and eggs. Beat until smooth and fold in
  fruit and nuts, batter will be thick. Pour mixture into a greased tube pan,
  then bake at 350 degrees for 50 to 60 minutes. Turn cake out of pan while
  hot. When cooled, the cake freezes well. The choices of flavored cake mixes
  and pudding mixes is yours and coconut may be substituted for nuts.

 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 8 servings
 
----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      2 lb Ripe peaches; peeled                1 tb Quick-cooking tapioca
    1/3 c  Sugar                             1/4 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
      2 tb Fresh lemon juice             

-------------------------------CRUMB TOPPING-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour        4 tb Unsalted butter; chilled
      6 tb Light brown sugar                 1/4 ts Cinnamon

------------------------------------CAKE------------------------------------
      6 tb Sour cream                      1 1/2 ts Pure vanilla extract
    1/4 ts Baking soda                       3/4 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
      1 lg Egg                               1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/3 c  Sugar                             1/4 ts Salt
      4 tb Unsalted butter; softened      
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 375F 15 minutes before baking, with the rack in the center
  of the oven. Butter an 8-inch square baking pan, preferably glass. Cut the
  peaches into 1/2-inch slices. Put in a pan with sugar, lemon juice, tapioca
  and nutmeg and toss gently. Cook over high heat until syrup begins to
  bubble, about 4 minutes. Set aside.
  
  FOR THE TOPPING: Work the flour into the sugar, butter and cinnamon until
  the butter is the size of small peas. This can be done with a food
  processor or pastry blender. Set aside.
  
  FOR THE CAKE: Stir the sour cream and baking soda together and let stand
  while you begin the cake. Cream the egg, sugar and butter in the processor
  or with a mixer until it is light and fluffy. Add the vanilla and sour
  cream and mix well. Gently fold in the flour, baking powder and salt. In
  the processor, do this by pulsing the machine on and off several times.
  Spread the warm peaches and their juice in the bottom of the baking pan.
  Spoon the batter over the peaches and spread in a thin, even layer with a
  rubber spatula. It's OK if the peaches are not completely covered. Sprinkle
  the topping over the batter. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the
  center of the cake--not the fruit--comes out clean, 25-to-28 minutes.

  batches in blender, they tend to stick, so scrape often. Set aside all but
  about 1/4 cup. To the 1/4 cup cookie crumbs, add a few drops green food
  coloring and mix using a fork. When cakes are cooled to room temperature,
  crumble into a large bowl. Toss with half the remaining cookie crumbs and
  the chilled pudding. gently combine. Line new, clean kitty litter box. Put

  Here is a recipe, developed young man here in the Detroit area. With this
  recipe, he won a $10,000 scholarship to Johnson and Wales College, which is
  considered a top-notch cooking school, located in Charleston, SC. This
  young man, Andre Black, spent 2 weeks developing this recip, this cake was
  among the top 19 recipes chosen <out of 270> as winners. Andre was on the
  front page of the Detroit News yesterday, along with the recipe. The
  Detroit News food writer, Robin Mather says "For a Carrot Cake, this is a
  hell of a fruit cake. She found this cake suited to 3 8" layers.
  
  Preheat oven to 350.  Grease and flour three 8" layer pans. Combine eggs,
  sugar and oil.  Beat on high speed until creamy and thick, 3-5 minutes.
  Sift together flour, cinnamon, salt and baking soda. Slowly add 1/3 of the
  dry ingredients to egg mixture; beat well. Repeat with remaining dry
  ingredients, beating well after each addition. Batter will be extrememly
  stiff; it may be necessary to blend with a spatula or spoon. One by one,
  fold in carrots, coconut, pineapple, walnuts and raisins.
  
  Divide batter between the 3 prepared cake pans.  Bake at 350 for 40-45
  minutes, arranging cake pans in oven once.  The cake is done when the
  tester inserted in center comes out clean.  Let cake cool in pans 5
  minutes.  Turn out onto rack to cool completely.
  
  When cakes are cool, prepare frosting: combine margarine, cream cheese,
  sugar and vanilla.  Beat until smooth.  Frost cake.
  
  * Andre's original recipe, written in professional baking terms, calls for
  6 oz beaten eggs, 15 1/2 oz of sugar, and 12 oz cake flour

  mixer at medium-high speed) Stir in, mixing thoroughly, citron and
  chocolate pieces Place mixture in refrigerator to chill. FOR SHELLS: Sift
  together first 4 ingredients into a bowl. Cut shortening in with a pastry
  blender until pieces are size of small peas. Stir in eggs. Blend in, a
  tablespoon at a time, the vinegar and cold water. Turn dough onto a lightly
  floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 to 8 minutes.
  Use a small amount of additional flour if necessary to get a smooth dough.

      Title: Cheese-Stuffed Manicotti
 Categories: Italian, Pasta, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 6 servings
 
-------------------------------CHEESE FILLING-------------------------------
    1/2 lb Fresh mozzarella cheese,                 Salt and freshly ground
           1/2-inch dice                            Black pepper
      2 lb Ricotta cheese (or 2              1/4 c  Minced fresh parsley
           15-ounce containers)               14    Manicotti shells
    1/4 lb Prosciutto, 1/4-inch dice           3 c  Tomato sauce (Meat or
      2    Eggs                                     Marinara)
    1/2 c  Freshly graterd Parmesan          1/2 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
           Cheese                                   Cheese
 
        TO MAKE THE FILLING:  combine all the filling ingredients and mix
  very thoroughly.
        Heat 4 to 6 quarts of salted water to the boil in a large pot; add 2
  tablespoons oil to help prevent pasta from sticking.  Add half of the
  manicotti and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, or until not quite al dente. Stir
  occasionally with a long-handled fork.  Hold a strainer over the pot and
  use a slotted spoon to remove 1 or 2 manicotti at a time from the boiling
  water, placing them in the strainer.  Shake manicotti free of water over
  the pot.  Spread a clean kitchen towel on the kitchen counter. Place the
  manicotti side by side on the towel, which will absorb all the remaining
  moisture.  (The shells must be completely dry before stuffing.) Repeat
  until all shells are cooked. Cool. Generously butter a baking dish, 13 x 10
  inches. Fill each shell with some of the stuffing, letting a little of the
  stuffing come out on either end.  This is best done with a pastry tube and
  a large nozzle; otherwisew use a regular teaspoon. Lay the stuffed
  manicotti side by side in the buttered dish and surround them with any
  manicotti shells you may not have sufficient stuffing for. Pour half the
  tomato sauce over the shells and sprinkle with 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.
  Bake in a preheated moderate oven for 15 to 20 minutes. Heat remaining
  tomato sauce to serve separately.  Serve with additional Parmesan Cheese.

-----------------------------------DOUGH-----------------------------------
  2 1/4 c  All-purpose flour                        Salt
    1/4 c  Plus                                1    Egg yolk
      3 tb Butter                        

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      4 oz Mozzarella                               Pinch of nutmeg
      3 oz Cooked ham                          2 tb Chopped parsley
      2    Eggs                                2    Eggs, beaten
    1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese                   Oil for frying
 
  Sift the flour into a mound, make a well in the center and add the butter,
  cut into pieces, a pinch of salt and an egg yolk. Mix together, kneading
  and gradually adding sufficient water to obtain a smooth elastic dough.
  Shape into a ball, cover and leave to stand in a cool place for at least

      Title: Riccota
 Categories: Italian, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      2 qt Milk                              1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
      3 tb Distilled white vinegar OR               Salt (if desired)
 
  Pour the milk into a heavy stainless-steel or enameled saucepan and stir in
  the white vinegar or lemon juice.
  
  Set the pot over very low heat and bring the milk very slowly to a simmer
  (a reading of 200 degrees on a thermometer).  There will be fine beads
  around the edge of the milk, which will look foamy but will not appear to
  be boiling.
  
  Remove the pot from the heat and set it, covered, in a spot where it can
  remain undisturbed and where the temperature will remain fairly uniform at
  a reading between 80 and 100 degrees.  (An unheated oven, without a pilot
  light, is a good spot.)  Let the milk stand for about 6 hours, or until a
  solik curd floats above the liquid (the whey). More or less time may be
  required, depending on the temperature of the environment and the
  characteristics of the milk.
  
  Line a fine sieve with doubled, dampened cheesecloth (or, better yet, two
  layers of very fine-mesh nylon curtain netting, dampened) and set it over a
  bowl.  Dip the curds and whey into the sieve and allow the whey to drain
  off until the ricotta is yogurtlike.  If you want firmer cheese, tie the
  corners of the cloth to form a bag and hang it up to drain further. (In
  warm weather, the draining might well be completed in the refrigerator.)
  
  When the texture of the ricotta is to your liking, add a little salt (from
  1/4 to 1/2 t) if you wish.  Store the cheese, covered, in the refrigerator.
  It will be at its best after it has chilled for 24 hours, and will keep
  well for 4 or 5 days.
  
  Author's notes:  Unlike most other fresh cheeses-cottage and cream cheese,
  for example-the curd of this bland, light cheese is fromed from the direct
  addition of acid to the milk, not by fermentation. For that reason the time
  required to make it is generally short.
   If you haven't used this Italian favorite before, try it in place of
  cottage cheese, as well as in Italian recipes for such dishes as lasagne
  and manicotti.  You'll find it is a bit creamier than most cottage cheeses,
  with a much finer curd.
   For a pleasant light milk dessert, sweeten ricotta slightly and top it
  with a sprinkling of grated chocolate or cinnamon.

      Title: Basic Fondue (Fondue Neuchateloise)
 Categories: Appetizers, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 1 servings
 
  2 1/2 fl Dry white wine                    1/2 fl Kirsch**
           Clove garlic                             Shake pepper
  5 1/2 oz Emmental and Gruyere cheese*             Grind fresh nutmeg
      1 ts Cornstarch                          6 oz White bread, cubed
 
  (Note:  the above measurements are for *each* person.
   Multiply by your number of guests.)
  
  * Grated and mixed half and half.  ** This is Swiss cherry firewater:
  clear, dry-tasting -- *not* "cherry brandy", which is dark and sweet.
  
  Most good liquor stores should carry it, at least one of the US brands like
  Hiram Walker, or else maybe Bols.  The best Kirsch is "Etter" brand from
  Switzerland, but the odds of your finding it are minuscule. -- In
  Switzerland, fondue is usually perpared in a "caquelon", an earthenware
  dish with a handle, glazed inside;  but any enamelled saucepan can be used,
  or a not too shallow fireproof dish. Rub the inside of the pan with half a
  cut clove of garlic, and let it dry until the rubbed places feel tacky. Put
  the wine in the dish and bring it to a boil. Slowly start adding cheese to
  the boiling wine, and stir constantly until each bit is dissolved, then add
  more.  When all the cheese is in, stir the kirsch into the cornstarch well,
  then add the mixture to the cheese and keep stirring over the heat until
  the mixture comes to a boil again.  Add freshly ground pepper and nutmeg to
  taste.  -- Remove the dish to on top of a small live flame (Sterno or
  alcohol burner) and keep it bubbling slowly. Bread should have been cubed
  ~- about 1-inch cubes -- for spearing with fondue forks and stirring around
  in the cheese.  The old custom is that if you accidentally lose the bread
  into the cheese from the end of your fork, if you're male, you have to buy
  a round of drinks for the table: if you're female, you have to kiss
  everybody. (Hmm.) .
  
  Other fondue info:  Do not drink water with fondue -- it reacts unkindly in
  your stomach with the cheese and bread.  Dry white wine or tea are the
  usual accompaniments.  Another tradition:  the "coupe d'midi", or "shot in
  the middle", for when you get full:  a thimbleful of Kirsch, knocked
  straight back in the middle of the meal, usually magically produces more
  room if you're feeling too full. Don't ask me how this works...it just
  does.  -- The crusty bit that forms at the bottom of the pot as the cheese
  keeps cooking is called the "crouton", and is very nice peeled off and
  divvied up among the guests as a sort of farewell to dinner.

      1 c  Walnuts                             1    Egg beaten with 1 tb water
      1 c  Crumbled blue cheese           
 
  Just chop 1 cup of walnuts (depending on the size of brie you need to
  cover) and stir into 1 cup crumbled blue cheese.  Press onto the top of the
  brie and carefully wrap a sheet of thawed puff pastry dough (Roll out to
  size needed).  Use fingers wet with cold water to seal underside of pastry.
  Cut off excess to make cut-outs and adhere to top of brie with a little
  cold water.  I refrigerate my brie at this point until I'm ready to bake.
  Remove from fridge, Brush w/egg wash (1 egg beaten with a Tbsp. cold water)
  and bake on a cookie sheet covered with baking parchment in a 375 degree
  oven for about 20 minutes until golden. (Parchment makes it simple to
  transfer brie to serving dish.) Let Baked Brie stand for 20-30 Min. before
  cutting to let it firm up a little.

  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour                        Plus 3 tablespoons, softened
    1/2 ts Salt                                1 c  Coarsely grated sharp
    1/8 ts Cayenne                                  -Cheddar
    3/4    Stick (6 tablespoons) cold          3 tb Heavy cream
           -unsalted butter, cut into          1 lg Egg, beaten lightly
           -bits,                          1 1/2 c  Finely shredded Swiss cheese
 
  from 1969
  
  Into a bowl sift together the flour, the salt, and the cayenne, blend in
  the 6 tablespoons butter and the Cheddar, and stir in the cream, stirring
  until the mixture forms a dough. Chill the dough, wrapped in wax paper, for
  2 hours.
  
  Roll out the dough 1/16 inch thick on a lightly floured surface and using a
  1 1/2 inch round cutter cut out rounds, rerolling the scraps and cutting
  out additional rounds. Arrange the rounds on baking sheets, brush them
  lightly with the egg, and bake them in batches in the middle of a preheated
  450~ F. oven for 5 to 7 minutes, or until they are browned lightly. The
  pastry rounds may be made 2 days in advance and kept in an airtight
  container.
  
  In a small bowl cream together well the Swiss cheese and the remaining 3
  tablespoons butter. Arrange half the pastry rounds, bottom sides up, on
  baking sheets, divide the cheese mixture among them, and sandwich the
  mixture with the remaining pastry rounds, pressing the rounds together
  lightly. Bake the croutes in the preheated 450~ F. oven for 4 minutes, or
  until the cheese is just melted. Makes about 46 croutes.

  tang to it.  Use it either with raw vegetables or any kind of cracker or
  diet cracker.
  
       tsp Italian seasoning Salt and pepper to taste
  
  Mix all the ingredients together (you can even beat this mixture until
  smooth if you're going to be dipping things like cauliflower in it).

  an hour and preferably overnight. At party time, remove from refrigerator
  and serve either picnic-style in the cottage cheese container or put in a
  bowl for serving.  Sprinkle a bit of paprika on the top for color.

           -finely chopped                   2/3 c  Chicken stock
      2    Green onions, chopped           1 1/2 c  Heavy cream

      2    Chinese sausages, finely       
 
  Salt and white pepper to taste Sprigs of fresh coriander
  
  Toss the shrimp with 1 teaspoon of the salt and let stand for 10 minutes.
  Rinse thoroughly, drain and pat dry.
  
  Finely chop shrimp and put them in a mixing bowl.
  
  Add remaining salt, ginger, rice wine, cornstarch, water chestnuts, green
  onions, coriander, sausage and cheese to mix- ture; mix thoroughly.
  
  If you are using won ton wrappers, trim the corner to make a circle.
  
  Place 1 heaping teaspoon filling in the center of 1 wrapper. Moisten the
  edge of the wrapper with water and fold in half to enclose filling and form
  a half-circle. Pinch the edges together to seal.
  
  Set on a baking sheet; cover with a towel. Repeat with remaining filling
  and wrappers.
  
  To cook and sauce 4 servings, add 1 tablespoon of the oil to a 10-inch
  nonstick skillet and set over medium heat.
  
  Arrange 12 gyozas in one single layer; pan-fry for 1 minute or until
  lightly browned. Turn the gyozas over to brown other side, about 1 minute

  Garnish with fresh coriander springs.
  
  Note: There is enough filling to make 4 dozen gyozas. The amount of sauce
  indicated above is enough for 12 gyozas. If you want to make more, multiple
  the sauce ingredients, but bear in mind that you will have to make the
  sauce separately as part of each batch. Freeze extra uncooked gyozas on a
  baking sheet; when frozen, transfer them to a freezer bag. Do not defrost
  before browning.
  
  Makes 4 dozen gyozas. Serves 16.

           -out 3/4 cup)                            -mported is best)
    1/3 c  Red onion; very thinly slic         1 tb Parsley; fresh, chopped
 
  1.  Prepare Whole Wheat Pizza Dough through Step 3. 2. Heat small skillet
  over low heat until hot to the touch.  Add pine nuts; reduce heat to very
  low.  Toast pine nuts, shaking pan frequently, until evenly golden, about 2
  minutes.  Set aside. 3. Heat oven to 500F. Oil a 12-inch pizza pan as
  necessary for type of pan (see below for tips); sprinkle with cornmeal if
  desired. 4. Combine 1 Tablespoon of the oil, the vinegar, and galric in
  medium bowl; add zucchini and red onion, tossing to coat. 5. Complete Whole
  Wheat Pizza Dough. 6. Place dough in prepared pan; brush surface with
  remaining oil. Sprinkle half the provolone evenly over dough, leaving a
  3/4-inch border; top with even layer of zucchini mixture. Sprinkle with
  salt and pepper to taste, then with the remaining provolone, all the
  mozzarella, Bel Paese, and Gorgonzola, and half the Parmesan. Sprinkle with
  additional salt and pepper.  Bake until crust is golden, about 15 minutes.
  Scatter pine nuts evenly over surface. Bake until pine nuts and crust are
  browned, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Sprinkle with remaining Parmesan and the
  parsley.  Serve immediately. Makes One 12-inch Pizza! Recipe from Cuisine,
  November, 1984.  See Whole Wheat Pizza Dough recipe. Which Pan for Pizza?
  Almost any type of pan can give good results, though directions for
  brushing with oil and sprinkling with cornmeal differ slightly with each.
  In fact, the use of cornmeal is not required to prevent sticking except
  when using a pizza stone, but a little sprinkled on the surface of any pan
  will give added texture to the crust. Tin-lined steel; aluminum round pizza
  pans or baking sheets:
      Generously brush the pan with olive oil. Black-finished metal baking
  sheets and pizza pans:
      Follow the manufacturer's directions for care.  Lightly brush bottom
  and sides (if any) with olive oil. Pyrex pizza pan:
      Generously brush pan with olive oil. Pizza Stone:
      Stones require preheating in a 500F oven.  They require no oiling but
  must be sprinkled with cornmeal to prevent sticking just before the pizza
  is transferred from the peel (paddle).  The peel must also be sprinkled
  with cornmeal before the uncooked pizza is place on it for transfer to the
  heated pizza stone.  When removing the hot pizza stone from the oven, be
  careful not to set it on a cold surface, or the stone will crack.

      Title: Glazed Almond Brie
 Categories: Appetizers, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 16 servings
 
      1    Wheel imported Brie cheese *      1/2 c  Sliced unblanched almonds
           - well chilled                           Red & green seedless grapes
      2 tb Confectioners' sugar                     - in clusters, for garnish
 
  *  The original recipe calls for "1 3/4-oz Wheel imported Brie". I think
  this might be an error, it could possibly be "One 3/4 LB wheel of Brie, but
  I don't know for sure.  -km-
  
  WITH A SMALL, flexible knife, cut away rind from top of chilled cheese. Be
  careful not to remove or split the rind on the sides. It will form a wall
  for the melted cheese. Sift 1 tablespoon of confectioners' sugar evenly
  over the surface and arrange almonds on top, pressing gently into place.
  The cheese can be prepared to this point as many as 2 days in advance.
  Cover loosely with foil and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before
  heating, place rack 6 inches from heat source and preheat the broiler. Line
  large baking sheet with aluminum foil, place cheese on it and sift 1
  tablespoon of confectioners' sugar over nuts. Broil cheese until top is
  evenly browned--about 1 to 2 minutes. Rotate cheese, if necessary, for even
  browning. Watch carefully so it does not burn. Use foil to lift cheese and
  transfer it to serving platter. Tear foil and gently remove it. Garnish
  with clusters of grapes.

  *DIRECTIONS*
  
  BLANCHING TECHNIQUE: Bring 1-quart of water to boil. Submerge tomatoes in
  boiling water for 3 minutes to reconstitute. Take 4 aside and cut into
  strips.
  
  In a food processor, combine cream cheese, butter, Parmesan, olive oil and
  remaining sun-dried tomatoes.  Process until smooth. Place in refrigerator
  for about 30 minutes, or until firm enough to shape into a ball. Place
  cheese ball on a platter. Arrange basil leaves and reserved tomato strips
  around cheese ball like a sunburst. To serve, spread on your favorite
  crackers.
  
  Makes 2-1/2 cups.
  
  Recipe from Melissa's brand Sun-dried Tomatoes.
  
  This recipe was called "Dried Tomato Dip" but I sure didn't see it as a dip
  so I renamed it.  I guess it could be a spread, but sure can't see
  "dipping" anything into this as it would be too stiff.

      Title: Broccoli Cheese Soup
 Categories: Soups/stews, Vegetables, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 c  Water                               2 c  Cubed Velveeta cheese
      1    (10-ounce)package frozen          1/2 c  All-purpose flour
           -chopped broccoli                   1 c  Half-and-half
      2 c  Milk                                2    Chicken bouillon cubes
 
  In large saucepan, cook broccoli in 1 cup water; do not drain.  Put milk,
  cheese, and flour into blender; cover and blend until smooth. Add
  half-and-half and bouillon cubes.  Cook, stirring, over medium heat until
  hot and mixture thickens.  Mixture will thicken more upon sitting.
  
  Makes 6 cups.
  
  NOTE:  I like to cut down a bit on the richness this soup has by using 2%
  milk; and Velveeta "Light" cheese.  Keep stirring-as it may burn. Do not
  cook for more than 25 minutes as it becomes a great cheese sauce after a
  while-good for pouring over potatoes-but not good if you want soup.

  *DIRECTIONS*
  
  Sprinkle 1/2 cup almonds on bottom of greased 10-inch tube pan. Set aside
  rest of almonds and chocolate chips.  Place remaining ingredients in mixer
  bowl.  Beat 4 minutes.  Fold in chips and almonds, then pour into pan. Bake
  in 350 F oven 60 to 70 minutes. Cool 15 minutes and remove from pan. Serve
  with topping of whipped cream if desired.
  
  Note from me:  A nice touch would be to puncture finished cake with
  long-tined fork.  Dribble over cake about 1/4 cup Kahlua.  Then serve with
  sweetened whipped cream flavored with almond or vanilla extract.

      Title: Chocolate Coffee Cream Roll
 Categories: Chocolate, Cakes/choc.
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 tb Unsalted butter                   1/4 ts Salt
      5 lg Eggs, separated                     1 tb Cold water
    1/2 c  All-purpose flour                   3    Egg yolks
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar                    1 ts Unflavored gelatin
    1/3 c  Plus 2 tb unsweetened cocoa         2 tb Instant coffee powder
      1 ts Vanilla extract                   1/2 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Salt                                1 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 ts Baking powder                     1/4 c  All-purpose flour
           Coffee Cream Filling                1 c  Heavy cream
  1 1/2 c  Milk                           
 
  Rich and delectable, this showy dessert makes an elegant finale to any
  dinner. The coffee and cream flavors are the perfect complement to the
  chocolate sponge roll.
  
  1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F.
  Lightly grease a 17-by-11-inch jelly roll pan. Line with waxed paper and
  grease and lightly flour the paper.
  
  2. Prepare the chocolate roll. Melt the butter in a small pan and let it
  cool slightly. In a medium-sized bowl stir together the flour, 1/3 cup of
  the cocoa, and the baking powder.
  
  3. In another medium-size bowl whisk together the 5 egg yolks, 1/4 cup of
  the sugar, and the melted butter until light, about 1 minute. Whisk in the
  vanilla. With a spoon, stir in about half of the dry ingredients.
  
  4. In a large, deep bowl combine the egg whites and salt; with an electric
  mixer, beat until soft peaks just begin to form. Gradually beat in the
  remaining 1/2 cup sugar, beating just until stiff, glossy peaks form.
  
  5. Fold about one-fourth (or a large spoonful) of the egg whites into the
  egg yolk mixture to lighten. Turn this mixture into the bowl of egg whites
  and partially fold together. Sift the remaining dry ingredients over the
  top and quickly and gently but thoroughly fold together until no streaks
  remain. Quickly spread in the prepared pan and bake 10 to 12 minutes, just
  until the center top springs back when lightly touched.
  
  6. Sift the remaining 2 tablespoons of cocoa onto a clean kitchen towel.
  Invert the cake onto it and peel off the paper (if it has stuck or is
  stubborn, lightly brush the paper with water before peeling off). With a
  long, sharp knife or a serrated knife, trim away about 1/2 inch from each
  edge. Start along one long side, roll up, jelly roll fashion. Wrap in the
  towel and let cool to room temperature.
  
  7. While roll cools, prepare the coffee cream. In a medium-sized saucepan
  over low heat, scald the milk until tiny bubbles appear around the edges of
  the surface. Place 1 tablespoon cold water in a cup and sprinkle the
  gelatin over it. Let soften until needed.
  
  8. In a medium-sized bowl stir together the sugar, flour, and salt.
  Gradually whisk in the scalded milk. Place in a heavy medium-sized saucepan
  over moderately low heat and, stirring constantly, cook until the mixture
  thickens and comes to a simmer. Whisk in the egg yolks and continue cooking
  and stirring until the mixture comes to a boil. Remove from the heat and
  stir in the coffee powder and dissolved gelatin until smooth; stir in the
  vanilla. Turn into a shallow bowl, cover with plastic wrap or waxed paper
  placed directly on the surface, and cool just to room temperature.
  
  9. Assemble the roll. Using chilled bowl and beaters, whip the cream until
  stiff. Give the coffee cream filling a good stir and fold in about
  one-fourth of the whipped cream to lighten. Turn the lightened coffee
  filling into the whipped cream and fold together.
  
  10. Carefully unroll the chocolate cake onto a board. Spread all of the
  coffee cream over it, making it thicker along the side where you will begin
  to reroll and leaving about 1 inch uncoated along the other long side.
  Reroll the chocolate cake to enclose the filling. Leave it on the board,
  seam side down, cover, and chill until set, at least 4 hours or overnight.
  Trim the ends and cut into slices. Serve cold.

  1 1/4 c  Cocoa                               2 c  Sweet Butter
  1 1/2 ts Baking Soda                     2 1/4 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Baking Powder                   2 1/4 c  10x Powdered Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Ground Cinnamon                     3    Eggs
  2 1/4 c  Buttermilk                      2 1/4 c  Heavy Cream
  1 1/2 c  Thick Sour Cream               
 
  THE CAKE: Preheat oven to 350F.  Grease 3 round, 9" cake pans. Line
  bottoms with greased wax paper. Sift together flour, 3/4 c cocoa, baking
  soda, baking powder and cinnamon. Mix in buttermilk and coffee (dissolve
  coffee in an equal amount of hot water first.) Cream 1 1/2 c butter with
  the sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time until thick.
  Beating on low speed, slowly mix in buttermilk mixture. Beat 'til well
  blended.  Bake about 35 minutes, or until a straw comes out clean. Remove
  to racks to cool.  After they are cooled, put in 'fridge'. After 1 hour in
  'fridge', split each in half (see note at bottom.) Wrap each layer in wax
  paper or plastic wrap, and freeze immediately. SOUR CREAM FILLING: Beat 3/4
  c heavy cream, gradually adding 3/4 c 10x sugar until stiff. Gently fold in
  3/4 c sour cream. Set aside in 'fridge' (covered.) CHOCOLATE SOUR CREAM
  FROSTING: Melt remaining (1/2 c) butter.  Add 1/2 c 10x sugar and remaining
  (1/2 c) cocoa.  Stir with a wire whisk over low heat until smooth; cool.
  Beat remaining (1 1/2 c) heavy cream; add remaining (1 1/2 c) 10x sugar
  until soft peaks form.  Add cooled chocolate mixture; beat until stiff.
  Fold in remaining (3/4 c) sour cream. CONSTRUCTION: Build layers from the
  bottom up as follows: Cake, 1/3 the filling, cake, 2/3 c frosting. Repeat
  above twice, for total of six layers. Put remaining frosting on sides.
  Chill two hours before serving. Note: The cakes must be well-chilled before
  assembly, or they will disintegrate under their own weight during assembly.
  If the cake tops rose during baking, the layers will not stack well. You
  will need to slice the excess off *after* chilling, but *before* splitting
  into layers. Source: Someone named Judith Olney, I'm sure. This was printed
  in some newspaper about 1983--probably the Durham [NC] Morning Herald. This
  is one incredible cake--a chocoholic's fantasy. Posted by Brian Groover

------------------------SEE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE II------------------------
 
   FOR THE CAKES: Butter two 9" round cake pans and line the bottoms with wax
  paper, then butter the paper. Dust the pans with flour and knock out the
  excess. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
   In the top of a double boiler, heat the chocolate over hot water,
  stirring, until just melted. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the
  butter, one tablespoon at a time. Continue to stir the mixture until
  smooth. In the bowl of the mixer, beat the egg yolks until combined. Add 34
  cup of the sugar, a little at a time, and continue to beat the mixture
  until it falls in a ribbon when the beater is lifted.
   Beat in the melted chocolate mixture, the liqueur and the orange pinch of
  salt until frothy. Add the cream of tartar and beat the whites until they
  hold soft peaks. Add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, a little at a time, and
  beat the whites until they are stiff. Sift the flour with the remaining 1/4
  teaspoon salt onto a sheet of wax paper. Stir one fourth of the whites into
  the batter. Fold in the remaining whites and sift and fold the flour
  mixture in batches into the egg mixture until just combined.
   Pour the batter into the cake pans, smoothing the tops, and bake the
  layers in the middle of the oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a cake
  tester inserted into the centers comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in the
  pans on racks for 5 minutes, invert the cakes onto the racks, and remove
  the wax paper carefully. Let the cakes cool completely. The cakes form a
  thin crust that will flake off.

      Title: Chocolate Orgasms
 Categories: Chocolate, Cakes/choc.
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 oz Unsweetened chocolate             1/2 c  Plus 2 Tbsp chopped walnuts
      8 tb Unsalted butter, room temp               Frosting
  1 1/4 c  Plus 1 Tbsp. sugar              1 1/2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract                   1/4 c  Evaporated milk
      3 lg Eggs, room temp                   1/3 c  Sugar
    3/4 c  All-purpose flour              
 
  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Lightly grease an 8-inch square pan with
  butter or vegetable oil.  Melt the chocolate and butter in the top of a
  double boiler placed over simmering water.  Cool the mixture for 5 minutes.
  
  Place the sugar in a medium-size mixing bowl and pour in the chocolate
  mixture.  Using an electric mixer on medium speed, mix until blended, about
  25 seconds.  Scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the vanilla. With
  the mixer on medium-low speed, add the eggs one at a time, blending after
  each addition until the yolk is broken and dispersed, about 10 seconds.
  Scrape the bowl after the last egg and blend until velvety, about 15 more
  seconds.
  
  Add the flour on low speed and mix for 20 seconds; finish the mixing by
  hand, being certain to mix in any flour at the bottom of the bowl. Stir in
  1/2 cup of the nuts.  Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan and
  sprinkle the remaining 2 Tbsp of nuts over the top. Bake the brownies on
  the center oven rack until a thin crust forms on top and a tester inserted
  in the center comes out with a moist crumb, about 35 minutes. (The center
  of the brownies should never quite rise to the height of the edges.)
  
  Remove pan from oven and place on a rack to cool for 1 hour.
  
  FROSTING: To prepare the frosting, melt the chocolate in the top of a
  double boiler placed over simmering water. Pour the evaporated milk into an
  electric blender and add the sugar and the melted chocolate. Blend the
  frosting on medium-low speed until it thickens, about 50 seconds (the sound
  of the machine will change when this process occurs.)
  
  Using a frosting spatula, spread the frosting evenly over the surface of
  the cooled brownies and allow them to sit for 1 hour before cutting. Makes
  36 small brownies.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
     10 oz Baker's semi-sweet chocolate      1/2 ts Vanilla
           -(do not substitute)                     Butter and powdered cocoa
    1/2 c  Lightly salted butter                    -for the pan
      6 lg Eggs, separated, at room                 Frosting:
           -temperature                        1 c  Sour cream at room
      1 c  Granulated sugar                         -temperature
      2    To 4 tsp creme de cacao,           14 oz Baker's semi-sweet chocolate
           -Kahlua or dark rum                      -(do not substitute)
 
  Cake:
  
  Place oven rack in lower third of the oven, and preheat oven to 375
  degrees.  Butter an 8 inch springform pan, and coat with powdered cocoa.
  
  Melt chocolate and butter in a double boiler over hot, but *not boiling*,
  water. (don't rush this step, chocolate burns easily)
  
  Beat egg yolks in a lg mixer bowl at high speed, gradually adding 3/4 c of
  the granulated sugar.  Beat until yolk mixture is pale yellow and thick, 4
  to 6 minutes.  Add melted chocolate mixture to the yolk mixture. Beat until
  completely smooth.  Add vanilla and liquor of your choice. Beat until
  blended.
  
  Beat egg whites in mdm mixer bowl at high speed until soft peaks form.
  Gradually beat remaining 1/4 c granulated sugar into whites; continue
  beating until stiff but not dry peaks form. Fold whites *gently* but
  thoroughly into chocolate mixture.  Pour batter evenly into pan; smooth
  top.
  
  Bake 15 minutes.  Reduce oven to 350 degrees; bake another 15 minutes.
  Reduce oven temp to 250; bake 30 minutes longer (total baking time is 1
  hour).  Turn off oven; prop open oven door and allow cake to remain in oven
  for 30 minutes.  Remove cake from oven and cover top with damp paper
  towelling; let stand 5 minutes.
  
  Remove towelling and cool cake completely.  Dome of cake will crack and
  collapse; this is normal - press top of cake down lightly to smooth top.
  Remove springform and transfer cake to serving platter.
  
  To make the frosting:
  
  Melt chocolate in double boiler over hot but not boiling water. Using a
  wooden spoon, mix in sour cream.  Pour over the cake. Let cool and harden.

      Title: Chocolate Fudge Icing (For Plain Cake)
 Categories: Chocolate, Cakes/choc.
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 c  Minus 1 TBSP rich milk              2 c  Sugar
           Remove from heat and stir in      1/8 ts Salt
           -until dissolved:                   2 oz Grated chocolate
 
  Re: Chocolate Fudge Icing
  
  This icing recipe is a candy recipe with milk added to make it  into
  frosting.
  
  Bring to a boil in a large heavy pan:
  
  Bring to a boil and cook covered 2-3 minutes until the steam  washes down
  from the sides of the pan any crystals which may have  formed. Uncover,
  redice heat and cook without stirring to soft-ball  stage, 238 degrees.
  When nearing 238, there is a fine  overall  bubbling with, simultaneously,
  a coarser patter, as though the fine  bubbled areas were being pulled down
  for quilting into the  coarser  ones. Remove from heat without jostling or
  stirring.  Cool the  candy  to 110. You may hasten this process by placing
  the hot pan in a larger pan of cold water until the bottom of the pan has
  cooled.  Add: 2 4 TBSP butter
  
  Beat fudge partially.  Add: 1 tsp vanilla
  
  Then beat until it begins to lose its sheen.  At this point the drip from
  the spoon, when you flip it over, holds its shape against  the bottom of
  the spoon.  Quickly add: 1/2 1 c. broken nut meats
  
  Pour  the  fudge into a buttered pan.  Cut into  squares  before  it
  hardens.  To  use  fudge for centers, beat until  thick,  knead  and shape.
  
  For chocolate fudge icing, the book says to:
  
  Use in all: 1 c. milk
  
  Beat until the icing is of the right consistency to be spread.

      Title: Chocolate Mosaic Fruit Tart

      Yield: 8 servings
 
----------------------------CHOCOLATE TART CRUST----------------------------
      4 oz Ghirardelli Semi-Sweet            1/2 c  Cold butter, cut up
           -Chocolate                        1/8 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Powdered sugar                      1    Egg
    1/2 c  Slivered almonds                    1 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Unsifted flour                

---------------------------CHOCOLATE TART FILLING---------------------------
    1/2 c  Butter, softened                    1 ts Vanilla or Grand Marnier
    1/2 c  Powdered sugar                           Fresh fruit: strawberries,
      1    Egg                                      -kiwi, bananas,
      4 oz Ghirardelli Semi-Sweet                   Green grapes, oranges, etc.
           -Chocolate                        1/4 c  Apricot jam
      3 tb Heavy whipping cream           
 
  Servings: 8
  
  DIRECTIONS: For crust: Place broken chocolate pieces, sugar and almonds
  into bowl of processor or blender. Process for about 20 to 25 seconds until
  the mixture is like powder. On top of chocolate mixture in food processor,
  spread flour, butter and salt. Process 15 to 20 pulses or until butter is
  in very fine pieces. (Or butter may be cut into flour by hand using a
  pastry cutter, then combined with chocolate.) Add egg and vanilla. Pulse
  about 15 times or stir lightly until mixture sticks together when pinched
  with fingers. On plastic wrap, knead a few times to bring dough together to
  form a ball; flatten to 8". It is easier to use your fingers to pat the
  dough into tart pan than to roll dough. Use a 10 1/2" flat tart pan with 1"
  fluted sides. Bake in center of oven at 350-F for 15 to 18 minutes or until
  baked shell springs back when touched. (Do not overbake.) Cool. Remove
  outside ring of pan. Crust may be prepared a day in advance, if desired.
  (MY NOTES: this crust seemed too wet before baking, but turned out fine
  after about 16 or 17 minutes baking time. It was like a brownie crust.)
  
  Chocolate tart filling: In small mixer bowl, beat butter with sugar and
  egg; beat until fluffy. Melt broken chocolate in double boiler, stirring
  constantly, or microwave on medium for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Add warm
  chocolate to creamed mixture and beat well. Mix in cream and vanilla,
  beating until thick and creamy. Spread filling over baked Chocolate Tart
  Crust. While filling is still soft, artistically arrange fruit on top. For
  fruit glaze, strain apricot jam. With pastry brush, use glaze to cover
  pieces of fruit and top edge of crust. Chill about 2 hours. Decorate with
  chocolate curls, if desired. Let stand 30 minutes at room temperature
  before serving.

      Title: Chocolate Fudge Cake
 Categories: Chocolate, Cakes/choc.
      Yield: 9 servings
 
      1 lb Milk chocolate                    3/4 ts Baking soda
    1/2 lb Semisweet or                      3/4 ts Salt
           -extra-bittersweet chocolate    1 1/2 c  Milk
    3/4 lb Softened butter                     3    Eggs
           FUDGE CAKE                      1 1/2 ts Vanilla extract
      3 c  Cake flour                          4 oz Unsweetened chocolate
      2 c  Light-brown sugar                   6 oz Softened butter
  2 1/4 ts Baking powder                  
 
  MILK CHOCOLATE FROSTING
  
  PREPARATION:  FROSTING.  Chop both chocolates into coarse bits and melt in
  a double boiler set over hot (not boiling) water.  Stir occasionally until
  completely melted.  Remove pan from hot water and allow the chocolate to
  cool until just no longer warm to the touch, about 20 minutes. Place the
  butter in a bowl and beat in the cooled chocolate until the mixture is
  evenly blended, about 3 minutes. Frosting can be stored at a cool
  temperature for up to 3 days, or several months in the freezer. Heat the
  oven to 350F.  Butter two 9-inch round cake pans and line them with
  buttered and floured parchment paper or waxed paper.
  
  FUDGE CAKE.  Sift the flour.  Measure 3 cups.  In a large bowl, mixx
  together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, breaking
  up any lumps of sugar. In a small bowl, whisk about 1/2 cup of the milk
  with the eggs and vanilla; set aside. Chop the chocolate into coarse bits
  and melt in a double boiler set over hot (not boiling) water. Combine the
  remaining cup of milk and the butter with the mixed dry ingredients and
  beat for 1 1/2 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl twice. Add the egg
  mixture in 3 parts, scraping the sides of the bowl and beating for 20
  seconds after each addition. Add the melted chocolate and beat until just
  incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake in the center
  of the preheated oven until the cake springs back when lightly pressed in
  the center, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool the cakes in their pans for 10 minutes
  and invert onto racks. Cool completely before frosting. Frost the top
  surface of one layer of cake and top with the second layer. Spread the
  remaining frosting on the top and sides of the cake. Make a decorative
  pattern zigzag in the frosting by pulling a serrated knife across the
  surface in a back-and-forth motion.  Use a small spatula or spoon handle to
  pull out spikes of frosting all around the sides. Cake can be completed a
  day ahead and refrigerated.
  
  SERVING:  Return to room temperature if refrigerated.  Cut into wedges and
  serve.
  
  Makes one 9-inch cake.

  "The date filling makes this special, and the frosting is unusually good.
  Because the cake has a custard filling, it needs to be kept refrigerated."
  
  Preheat oven to 350 F.  Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler
  over barely simmering water (or in the microwave).  Sift the flour, baking
  powder, and salt together.  In a large mixer bowl, cream the butter and
  sugar until the mixture is fluffy.  Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well
  after each addition.  Blend in the melted chocolate and vanilla. Add the
  dry ingredients to the chocolate mixture, alternating with the buttermilk
  and beginning and ending with the flour. Do not overbeat.
  
  Pour the batter into three 8 inch buttered cake layer pans.  Bake for 25 to
  30 minutes, or until the cake has shrunk away a bit from the sides of the
  pans and the tops spring back when touched with your finger. Allow to stand
  in pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a rack to cool. While the cakes
  are cooling, prepare the filling and frosting.
  
  To make the filling, heat the milk and dates in the top of a double boiler
  over hot water until the milk is scalded.  Beat the egg, then add the
  sugar, flour, and salt; beat again.  Add 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture to
  the egg mixture, then stir back into the pan and cook for 3 minutes, until
  thick, stirring with a rubber spatula.  Let cool. Add the nuts, and
  vanilla. Refrigerate for 1-1/2 hours before filling the cake.
  
  To make the frosting, combine all the ingredients in a large mixer bowl.
  Beat on high speed for 1 minute, or until the frosting is light and creamy.
  
  To assemble, place 1 cake layer on a large plate and cover to within 1/4
  inch of the edge with half the chilled filling.  Top with another cake
  layer and the remaining filling mixture.  Finish with the last cake layer.
  Frost the sides and top of the cake with the fudge frosting forming swirls
  on the top with a knife.  Refrigerate, but bring to room temperature before
  serving.

  Melt butter in microwave, stir it, make sure it's not too hot. Stir in egg
  thoroughly, add to cake mix, stir up into a cookie dough. All dry
  ingredients should be moistened.
  
  At this point you can use it or wrap it airtight and store in fridge up to
  a couple of weeks.
  
  Scoop about a heaping teaspoon full and mould it around a chocolate mint
  wafer.  If you have a gem pan (shallow muffin tin), put them into the
  depressions.  Bake at 350 degrees, check after 9 minutes. ("Cook at
  moderate heat until done.")
  
  Cool completely in pan, remove with plastic fork.  Will make more than 4
  dozen.  --Jocelyn "Mom" Baden, Costa Mesa CA
  
  [I haven't tried this yet myself; when I went down to TJ's they were out of
  the chocolate mint UFOs, and we don't keep cake mix in the house. Mom
  vouches for it as a great treat to keep on hand for cooking in the
  toaster-oven; the gem pan holds 6 cookies and fits neatly on the rack.]

      Title: Chocolate Intemperance
 Categories: Chocolate, Cakes/choc.
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  1 1/2    Pounds, semisweet chocolate        23 oz Brownie mix
      3    Eggs, seperated                     2 tb Water
    1/2 c  Strong coffee                       3    Eggs
    1/2 c  Tia Maria                                Glaze:
      2 tb Sugar                               8 oz Semisweet chocolate chips
    1/2 c  Heavy cream                       1/3 c  Water
           Cake:                          
 
  Serves: 8 to 10
  
  This mousse-filled, chocolate-swathed mold is an embarrassment of riches.
  When served to chocolate lovers, the only sound in the room will be faint
  moans of pure, unadulterated decadent pleasure.
  
  Filling:
  
  Melt chocolate with coffee on top of a double boiler.  When chocolate is
  completely melted, remove pan from heat.  Beat egg yolks until pale yellow
  and stir into chocolate.  Gradually stir in Tia Maria. Cool mixture.
  
  In a seperate bowl, beat egg whites, gradually adding sugar until whites
  are stiff. Whip cream. Gently fold whipped cream into cooled chocolate
  mixture and then fold in egg whites.
  
  Preheat oven to 350.  Beat ingredients together at medium speed of electric
  mixer until batter is smooth.  Grease an 11-by-15 inch jellyroll pan. Line
  it with waxed paper.  Grease and lightly flower paper, shaking off any
  excess flower.  Spread batter evenly in jellyroll pan. Bake for 10 to 12
  minutes or until cake tests done. Turn cake onto a rack and peel off paper.
  Lightly oil a 2-quart charlotte mold and line with cooled cake. Cut rounds
  of cake to fit both top and bottom of mold, and a strip for sides. Place
  smaller round in bottom of mold. (you will probably have to piece one
  section of side to cover completely, but don't worry; any patchwork will be
  hidden by chocolate glaze.) Fit larger round of cake on top of mold. Chill
  for 3 or 4 hours or until firm. Unmold and cover with glaze.
  
  Melt chocolate in water and stir until smooth.  Spread over top of
  mousse-cake and drizzle down sides.  Chill again.  Serve in slender slices
  ~- its indecently opulent.
  
  Hints: Melt chocolate in microwave. Its much faster. Instructions are on
  the chocolate package.
  
  A souffle dish makes a good replacement for the Charlotte mold.

    1/2 c  Heavy cream                         2 tb Unsalted butter
  2 1/2 oz Unsweetened chocolate         

------------------------------CHOCOLATE CREAM------------------------------
  2 1/2 c  Heavy cream                              -(preferably Dutch process)
  3 1/2 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder            7 tb Confectioners' sugar

------------------------ASSEMBLY AND CHOCOLATE SYRUP------------------------
      3 tb Chocolate chips                     2 tb Light corn syrup
      2 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder            1 tb Granulated sugar
           -(preferably Dutch process)    
 
  PREPARE THE CAKE LAYERS:  Preheat the oven to 350 F.  Line two 9-inch round
  cake pans with waxed paper; butter and flour the pans; tap out any excess
  flour.
  
  In a mixer bowl, beat the butter until light and fluffy.  Gradually add the
  sugar and continue beating until smooth.  One at a time, beat in the eggs
  until well-blended.
  
  Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Add to
  the egg mixture in thirds, alternating with the milk, mixing only until
  blended.  Blend in the vanilla and liqueur.  Divide the batter between the
  two prepared pans.  Bake until the tops of the cakes are springy to the
  touch, 40 to 45 minutes.  Remove from the oven and set on racks to cool for
  30 minutes.  Loosen the edges with a knife and unmold. Peel off the waxed
  paper.  Set the cakes on a rack and let cool completely.
  
  PREPARE THE FILLING:  Combine the sugar, cream, chocolate and corn syrup in
  a small heavy saucepan.  Bring to a simmer over moderate heat, stirring
  frequently.  Reduce the heat to low and cook for 10 minutes, or until the
  mixture thickens.  Remove from the heat, dot the top with the butter and
  let cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes. When cool, stir in the
  butter until the fudge filling is smooth and creamy.
  
  PREPARE THE CHOCOLATE CREAM: Beat the cream and cocoa until soft peaks
  form.  Gradually add the confectioners' sugar and continue beating until
  stiff.
  
  ASSEMBLE THE CAKE:  Cover one cake layer with all of the fudge filling.
  Sprinkle evenly with the chocolate chips.  Spread 1/2 cup of the chocolate
  cream on top of the chips.  Top with the second cake layer and cover the
  top and sides of the cake iwth half of the remaining chocolate cream. Use
  the remainder in a pastry bag to decorate the cake as desired. Refrigerate
  for up to 3 hours before serving time.
  
  PREPARE THE SYRUP:  Combine the cocoa, corn syrup, sugar and 2 tablespoons
  of water in a small heavy saucepan.  Bring to a simmer over low heat and
  cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes.  Transfer the syrup to a small
  bowl and let cool to room temperature, stirring once or twice, to prevent a
  skin from forming.
  
  Just before serving, drizzle the syrup over the top of the cake in a lacy
  design.

      Title: Death By Chocolate Cake
 Categories: Chocolate, Cakes/choc.
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3 pk Ladyfingers                     2 1/2 c  Heavy cream
    1/2 c  Dark rum                          1/4 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 lb Butter (no substitutes)             1 ts Vanilla
     27 oz Semisweet chocolate chips           2 tb Vegetable oil
     12    Eggs                           
 
  From: John Totels, 25 May 89 00:13:00
  
  Here's a recipe I recently obtained from a friend who in turn received it
  from a friend ....  This recipe can be made a week or so in advance, or so
  I'm told.  It's more like a mousse than a cake, but it is indecently rich!
  
  Preparation: Paint outside of the ladyfingers with rum, and place flat side
  down, around the sides and on the bottom of a 10 in. springform pan. Melt
  butter in medium pan; remove from heat and add 24 oz. of the chocolate
  bits.  Stir until melted; cool slightly. Beat the egg yokes into the
  mixture one at a time until all are incorporated into the chocolate. Beat
  the egg whites until they form stiff, not dry, peaks. Fold the whites into
  the chocolate mixture, and pour into the lined springform pan. Chill for at
  least 6 hours.
  
  Whip the cream until thickened and add the sugar and vanilla. Continue
  whipping until very stiff.  Turn the cake onto a serving platter, removing
  the pan sides and bottom (the lady fingers will now be on top). Spread a
  layer of whipped cream over the entire cake, then pipe the rest of the
  whipped decoratively however you wish around the cake - be imaginative!
  Melt the remaining chocolate chips with the oil in a double boiler. Cool
  completely.  Dribble the sauce down the sides of the cake. Garnish with
  stemmed candied cherries. Store in the refrigerator.
  
  Should make about 16 servings, or 8 - depending....
  
  Note: If the cake is going to be displayed for any length of time, you may
  wish to use stabalized cream, and add 1 teaspoon of dissolved gelatin to
  the cake mixture.
  
  One more note: I don't know to whom the credit goes for this "slightly"
  fattening recipe, and I apologize for that.  But I am passing it on to
  those of you who are in good health.  If you are not in good health, you
  use this recipe at your own risk - 12 eggs, 2-1/2 cups of cream, 27 oz. of
  chocolate, 1-1/2 lb. of butter (no substitutes) - there ought to be a law!
  Thanks for listening.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/3 c  Egg white                           6    Egg yolks
    3/4 c  Sugar                               8    Egg whites
      2 tb Cocoa powder, unsweetened         1/2 c  Sugar
           GENOISE                                  GANACHE
     10    Eggs, beaten                        6 oz Belgian bittersweet

      2 tb Cocoa powder, unsweetened                GARNISH
      1 tb Butter, melted                    1/2 c  Almonds, toasted chopped
           MOUSSE                              1    Almonds, sliced; additional

           -chocolate                     
 
  MERINGUE LAYER
  
  Meringue:  Combine egg whites and sugar in the top of a double boiler. Heat
  to lukewarm.  Remove from heat.  Pour into mixing bowl and beat about 15
  minutes at medium speed, until stiff.  Quickly fold in the cocoa to prevent
  the meringue from falling.  Grease a 10" springform pan, line with
  parchment paper, and grease again.  Pipe meringue through a pastry bag
  using the round tube, forming a spiral on the bottom of the springform pan,
  starting from the center and working out toward the sides until the bottom
  is completely covered. Bake at 250 degrees for 2 hours. Allow to cool in
  the pan. Genoise: Grease a 10" x 3" round baking pan, line with baking
  parchment, and grease again. Combine beaten eggs and sugar in the top of
  the double boiler. Heat to lukewarm. Remove from the heat. Pour into a
  mixing bowl and beat on high speed about 10 minutes, or until the batter
  forms a ribbon.  Sift the flour and cocoa into the batter and fold to
  combine. Fold in the butter.  Pour into the prepared pan and bake at 350
  degrees 35 to 40 minutes, or until the cake springs back when lightly
  touched and a toothpick comes out clean.  Cool thoroughly. Remove from pan.
  Mousse:  Melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water.
  Remove pan from the heat and cool.  Beat in the egg yolks, one at a time.
  Beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Lightly fold a quarter of the
  beaten egg whites into the chocolate. Fold in the remaining egg whites,
  lightly but thoroughly. Chill. Ganache: Heat chocolate and cream together
  in the top of the double boiler over simmering water until the chocolate
  melts.  Blend well. Assembly: Spoon half the ganache over the meringue
  layer in the pan and smooth evenly over the surface. Cut the chocolate
  Genoise into two 1/4" slices, reserving the rest of the cake for another
  use. Place one slice over the ganache and meringue layer. Cover with about
  half the mousse. Top with the second layer of cake.  Spoon the remaining
  mousse over the cake and chill until set, at least four to six hours.
  Just before serving, spoon remaining ganache on the cake. Carefully line
  the sides of the cake with chopped toasted almonds. Decorate the top with
  hazelnut roses by placing the whole hazelnuts evenly around the top of the
  cake, then place almond slices around each hazelnut to resemble petals.

      Yield: 8 servings
 
  1 3/4 c  Sifted cake flour                 1/4 c  (1/2 stk) unsalted butter
    1/2 c  Cocoa powder (not a mix)            2 c  Unsifted confectioners'
      1 ts Baking soda                              -(10X) sugar
    1/2 ts Salt                                2    Squares (1 oz each)
    1/2 c  (1 stk) unsalted butter                  -unsweetened chocolate,
  1 1/4 c  Granulated sugar                         -melted
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla                         1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      2 lg Eggs                                2 tb Half-and-half, milk or
      1 c  Boiling water                            -evaporated milk
           FROSTING:                      
 
  CAKE:
  
  PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350F. Grease two 8-inch layer cake pans well, then dust
  then generously with cocoa. (This gives the cake layers a rich brown
  finish). Sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt onto a piece of waxed
  paper and set it aside. Cream the butter until it is fluffy, add the sugar
  and vanilla, and continue beating until the batter is silvery and light.
  Beat the eggs in one by one, then add the sifted dry ingredients,
  alternately with the boiling water, beginning and ending with the dry
  ingredients and beating well after each addition. Divide the batter equally
  between the two pans, smoothing the tops. Bake the layers uncovered for 30
  to 35 minutes, or until the layers feel spongy to the touch and begin to
  pull away from the sides of the pans. Cool the layers upright in their pans
  on wire racks for 10 minutes, then carefully loosen them around the edges
  with a spatula and turn them onto wire racks. Cool them completely.
  
  FOR THE FROSTING: Cream the butter until it is light, then add the
  confectioners' sugar gradually, beating all the while. Beat in the melted
  chocolate and vanilla, then add just enough cream to make the frosting a
  good consistency for spreading. Sandwich the two cake layers together with
  frosting, then frost the top and sides of the cake. Swirl the frosting into
  peaks and valleys. Makes about 8 servings.

  electric mixer set at mdeium speed, cream the butter and the sugar in a
  large bowl until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in one egg yolk at
  a time, blending well after each addition. Beat in the melted white
  chocolate mixture and the vanilla. At low speed, blend in the sifted flour
  mixture alternately with the buttermilk; do not overbeat. Fold in the
  coconut and pecans.
  
  3. Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.  Blend 1/3 of the egg whites
  into the cake mixture to lighten it; carefully fold in the remaining egg
  whites.  Spoon the batter into the prepared pans.
  
  4. Bake until the cake springs back when touched in the center and a cake
  tester inserted in the center of the pans comes out clean, about 35 to 40
  minutes. Transfer the cakes in the pans to wire racks and cool 10 minutes.
  Invert the cakes onto the wire racks, carefully peel off the parchment
  paper, and cool completely.
  
  FOR THE FROSTING:
  
  5. In a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the evaporated
  milk, sugar, butter, and egg yolks.  Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring
  constantly. Do not let mixture boil fast; lower the heat if necessary.
  Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla, pecans, and coconut. Plance the
  saucepan into a bowl filled with ice and stir constantly until the frosting
  is cool and slightly thickened.
  
  6. Place a cake layer on a serving platter. Spread 1/4 of the frosting
  evenly over the cake layer, making sure to spread it all the way to the
  edges. Top with the second layer, and spread with 1/4 of the frosting. Top
  with the third cake layer.  Evenly frost the top and sides of the cake with
  the remaining frosting.

      Title: Hyde Park Fudge Cake
 Categories: Chocolate, Cakes
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  5 1/3 oz Bitter chocolate (bakery        2 3/4 c  Sugar
           -uses Guittard brand)           1 1/3 ts Baking soda
    2/3 c  Shortening                      1 1/3 ts Salt
  2 2/3    Eggs (this is right -- comes             Icing:
           -from conversion of recipe)*      3/4 c  Sugar
  1 1/3 c  Water                               6 tb Evaporated milk
    3/4 c  Sour milk                           3 oz Chocolate, unsweetened
  1 1/3 ts Vanilla                         1 1/2 ts Butter
      3 c  Flour                          
 
  *Whether home cooks throw in that extra 1/3 egg is up to them, but baker
  and Rio Grande store manager Janine Gwaltney believes it makes a
  difference.  "Too much egg and the cake falls in the center," she says.
  
  Grease a Bundt pan.  Dust with fine bread crumbs and chill.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Melt the chocolate with the shortening.
  
  Combine eggs, water, milk, and vanilla.  Blend well.  Mix flour, sugar,
  soda, and salt thoroughly. (If you don't, the flour will clump in the
  batter.) Gradually add dry ingredients to liquid ingredients, blending on
  low speed of mixer until just mixed, scraping bowl well. Pour into pan and
  bake until done, 50-65 minutes. Cool in the pan 30 minutes. Turn out on a
  cake rack and glaze with icing.
  
  Icing:  While cake is cooling, heat the sugar in the evaporated milk in the
  top of a double boiler until the sugar is dissolved. (The mixture will not
  feel grainy when rubbed between the fingers.) Melt butter and chocolate
  together.  Combine with chocolate mixture. You may add one to two tsp hot
  water to the icing to enhance the sheen. Pour icing over the cake.

    1/2 c  Butter, softened (1 stick)          1 c  Raspberries
  1 1/3 c  Granulated sugar                    1 ts Grenadine

      1 ts Vanilla                                  -cream, orange zest,
           RASPBERRY FILLING:                       Fresh raspberries
 
  CHOCOLATE CAKE:
  
  PREPARE THE CAKE:  Grease a 15 x 10 x 1-inch baking pan.  Line with waxed
  paper.  Grease the waxed paper.  Preheat the oven to moderate (350F).
  
  Pour the boiling water over the cocoa powder in a medium-size bowl; stir to
  dissolve the cocoa.  Stir in the buttermilk; the mixture should be cool.
  Sift the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt onto a sheet of waxed
  paper.
  
  Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium
  speed until light and fluffy.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating after
  each addition.  Add the vanilla.  Beat the dry ingredients into the butter
  mixture, alternating with the cocoa mixture, beginning and ending with the
  dry ingredients.  Pour into the prepared pan.
  
  Bake for 20 minutes or until the center springs back when lightly pressed.
  Cool the cake in the pan on a large wire rack for 10 minutes. Turn the cake
  out onto the rack to cool completely.  Remove the waxed paper.
  
  PREPARE THE FILLING:  Heat the granulated sugar and water to boiling in a
  very small saucepan over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Boil
  until the temperature registers 240 F on a candy thermometer, about 10
  minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, beat the heavy cream, 10 X sugar, and vanilla in a small bowl
  until stiff.  Cover and refrigerate.
  
  Using clean beaters, beat together the egg whites and cream of tartar in a
  large bowl until soft peaks form.  Slowly beat the hot syrup into the egg
  whites, beating until the meringue forms stiff peaks and is cool.
  
  Place the raspberries in a blender or food processor.  Whirl for about 5
  seconds to puree.  Fold the raspberries and grenadine into the whipped
  cream.  Gently fold the meringue into the raspberry cream. Set aside.
  
  ASSEMBLE THE CAKE:  Cut the cake crosswise into three equal rectangles (5 x
  10 inches).  Place one rectangle on a serving platter. Top with 2 cups of
  the filling.  Repeat two more times, ending with a layer of raspberry
  cream.  Garnish with whipped cream, orange zest, or fresh raspberries, if
  you wish.
  
  Makes 8 servings.

  an excellent choice for February parties or for any occasion where a deluxe

  Servings: 10 to 15
  
  DIRECTIONS: Set a large mixer bowl in a sink filled with 2 inches of warm
  water. Separate eggs (you should have about 1 1/2 cups whites). Pour the
  whites into the warm mixer bowl and place yolks in a smaller mixer bowl (or
  let separated eggs stand, covered, at room temperature for 30 minutes).
  
  Meanwhile, in a small, heavy saucepan, partially melt unsweetened chocolate
  and semisweet chocolate pieces over low heat. Turn off heat and stir
  (chocolate will continue to melt).
  
  Cut a waxed paper liner for the bottom of a 10" tube pan, cutting it 1/2"
  wider than the pan and the center hole slightly larger than the tube.
  Grease pan thoroughly. Place liner in pan and grease liner.
  
  Beat egg yolks with an electric mixer on high speed for about 4 minutes or
  till they're thick and lemon colored. Add the 2/3 cup sugar, beating till
  very thick. Stir in the melted chocolate and chopped nuts.
  
  Thoroughly wash and dry beaters. Beat egg whites with vanilla and almond
  extract till foamy. Gradually add the 1/4 cup sugar to egg whites, beating
  till soft peaks form.
  
  Lighten egg yolk mixture with about 2 cups beaten egg whites. Add to the
  remaining egg white mixture and fold together to combine. Turn batter into
  prepared pan.
  
  Bake at 350-F for about 40 minutes or till top springs back when lightly
  touched. Run a knife around the edge of the pan and center to loosen. Cool
  in pan for 1 hour. Invert onto cake plate. Remove waxed paper.
  
  Prepare glaze; spread over top and sides of cake.
  
  Dark Chocolate Glaze: In a small heavy saucepan or skillet, melt chocolate
  over low heat. Remove from heat and stir in butter or margarine. In a small
  bowl, dissolve instant coffee in hot water. Stir in the sour cream and
  maple flavoring. Add sour cream mixture to chocolate, stirring till smooth
  and shiny. Makes 3/4 cup.

  *DIRECTIONS*
  
  *For the nicest looking shiny glaze, serve this cake on the day it is
  completed.  The cake remains moist and delicious, however, for several
  days.
  
  PREPARATION: Heat oven to 325F. Butter and flour an 8-inch square or
  10-inch round cake pan. Cut the 4 ounces of chocolate into small pieces and
  melt in the top of a double boiler set over hot water, stirring frequently.
  Remove pan from hot water and cool slightly. In a food processor, nut
  grinder or blender, grind the 4 ounces of almonds to a powder. If you use a
  processor or blender, put 2 tablespoons of the sugar in the machine along
  with the nuts.  Put ground nuts through a sieve to get rid of any remaining
  chunks.  Toss the powdered almond mixture with the flour. Separate the
  eggs.  Beat together the butter and 1/3 cup of the remaining sugar until
  creamy and light. Add the melted chocolate and the extract. Add the egg
  yolks, one at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition. Beat the
  whites to stiff peaks, add the remaining sugar, and beat until glossy. Fold
  in nut mixture.  Gently followed egg white mixture into chocolate just
  until incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake in a
  preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes
  out almost clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in the pan for about 10 minutes.
  Divide into individual servings if desired. Recipe can be made to this
  point up to a day ahead.
  
  CHOCOLATE GLAZE: Heat the chocolate and butter in the top of a double
  boiler set over hot water, stirring frequently, until just melted. Remove
  from hot water. Cool the chocolate glaze just until it thickens. It should
  remain pourable. Glaze whole cake or individual servings on a rack set over
  a pan to catch drippings. Garnish with almonds if desired.
  
  Serve at room temperature or refrigerate for up to 4 days.
  
  Serves 6.

      Title: The Ultimate Chocolate Mousse Cake
 Categories: Chocolate, Cakes/choc.
      Yield: 16 servings
 
      1 lb Bittersweet chocolate; coar              Chocolate ganache glaze
           -sely chopped                     2/3 c  Heavy cream
    1/2 lb Butter; unsalted                    6 oz Semi-sweet chocolate; finel
      6    Eggs; lightly beaten                     -y chopped
 
  Fat grams    per serving:              Approx. Cook Time:   :15 CHOCOLATE
  MOUSSE CAKE: 1. Preheat the oven to 425F. Wrap the outside of an 8-inch
  springform  pan in a double layer of aluminum foil to prevent seepage.
   Butter the pan and line the bottom with a round of parchment or waxed
  paper.  Butter the paper. 2. Combine the chocolate and butter in a large
  metal bowl over a pan of hot - not simmering - water (the bottom of the
  bowl should not touch the water). Let stand, stirring occasionally, until
  the chocolate is smooth and melted. Or melt in a glass bowl in a microwave
  oven on high (100%), stopping and stirring every 15 seconds; remove the
  chocolate when there are still a few lumps and stir until completely
  smooth. 3. Put the eggs in a large mixer bowl set over simmering water and
  stir constantly until warm to the touch, about 3 minutes; remove from the
  heat.  With an electric mixer, beat the eggs until they triple in volume
  and form soft peaks when the beater is lifted, 5 to 8 minutes. (To ensure
  maximum volume, if using a hand-held mixer, continue to beat the eggs over
  simmering water until they are hot to the touch, about 5 minutes, then
  remove from the heat and beat until cool.) 4. Fold half the eggs into the
  melted chocolate until partially incorporated. Add the remaining eggs and
  fold until they are just blended and no streaks remain. 5. Pour at once
  into the prepared springform pan and smooth the surface with a spatula.
  Place in a larger roasting pan and add enough hot water to the pan to reach
  about two-thirds of the way up the springform. 6. Bake for 5 minutes. Cover
  the top of the springform loosely with lightly buttered aluminum foil and
  bake for 10 minutes longer. Remove the cake from the oven and let cool on a
  rack for 45 minutes; then cover and refrigerate until chilled and very
  firm, about 3 hours. 7. To unmold, run a small spatula or a blunt knife
  around the edge and remove the side of the springform. Carefully invert the
  cake into a plate that has been covered with plastic wrap and remove the
  bottom of the springform; peel off the parchment. Reinvert the cake onto a
  cardboard round or a cake plate.  Cover and refrigerate for 6 hours or
  overnight, until thoroughly chilled, before serving. 8. If you want to
  cover the cake with a chocolate ganache glaze, set it on a rack or tuck
  strips of waxed paper around the bottom of the cake. Pour the tepid glaze
  onto the center of the cake, letting it cascade over the sides. Run a long
  metal spatula lightly across the top so that the glaze will not be too
  thick.  If necessary, use the spatula to patch any pare spots. Work quickly
  before the glaze sets. Prick any air bubbles with a needle or pin.
  Carefully remove any strips of waxed paper. Let the glaze stand undisturbed
  until set, 2 to 3 hours at room temperature, or 30 minutes in the
  refrigerator. CHOCOLATE GANACHE GLAZE: 1. In a small heavy saucepan, scald
  the cream.  Remove from the heat and immediately add the chopped chocolate.
  Cover and let stand for 5 minutes; then stir gently until the chocolate is
  fully melted and smooth. Let cool until tepid. 2. Stir the glaze to test
  it.  It is ready to use when a small amount mounds just a tiny bit when
  dropped from the spoon before disappearing into the mixture. If the glaze
  is too thick and the mound remainds on the surface, add warm water (or
  liqueur) by the teaspoonful, testing until the consistency is correct. If
  for some reason the glaze remains too thin, stir in more finely grated
  chocolate, heat until melted and then let cool again. Variations
  
  MINI-MOUSSE CAKE: This cake is perfect for serving 6 to 8. Make the
  Ultimate chocolate Mousse Cake, using 1/2 pound chocolate, 4 ounces of
  butter and 3 lightly beaten eggs. Bake in a 6-inch springform pan;
  temperature and baking remain the same. MOCHA FUDGE MOUSSE CAKE: Make the
  Ultimate Chocolate Mousse cake, prefereably using extra-bittersweet
  chocolate.  In step 2, add 2 tablespoons instant expresso powder to the
  melted chocolate and butter.  In step 5, pour halfe the chocolate mousse
  batter into the prepared springform pan and drizzle with have the Hot fudge
  (see recipe).  Add the remaining batter and drizzle on the remaining fudge.
  PRALINE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE: Make the Ultimate Chocolate Mousse Cake,
  preferably using extra-bittersweet chocolate. In Step 2, add 1/2 cup
  praline paste (see note) to the melted chocolate and butter. Garnish, if
  desired with toasted hazelnuts. (Toasted pecans are also nice). NOTE:
  Praline paste can be ordered from Maison Glass, 52 E. 58th St., New York,
  NY 10022; 212 755-3316. CHOCOLATE FRUIT MOUSSE CAKE: Make the Ultimate
  Chocolate Mousse Cake, preferably using extra-bittersweet chocolate. In
  Step 2, add 3/4 cup raspberry jelly or melted and strained apricot jam to
  the melted chocolate and butter.
   Garnish the cake with a sparkling glaze of 1/2 cup melted raspberry jelly
  or strained appricot jam mixed with 1 Tablespoon framboise (raspberry
  eau-de-vie).  Spoon this glaze over the top of the cake and immediately
  spread into a thin, even layer with a long, narrow spatula. BRANDIED CHERRY
  CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE: Make the Brandied Cherrys (see recipe) at least a
  day ahead.  Make the Ultimate Chocolate Mousse Cake (using semi-sweet
  chocolate). After Step 4, fold in 1 cup halved, well-drained brandied
  cherrys.

      Title: Tunnel of Fudge Cake
 Categories: Cakes, Chocolate
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  3 1/2    Sticks butter or margarine,     2 1/4 c  Flour
           -softened (14 oz)                   1 c  Unsweetened cocoa powder
  1 3/4 c  Sugar                               2 c  Chopped walnuts (8 oz.) **
      6    Eggs                            1 1/2 tb (to 2 Tbsp.) milk
  2 3/4 c  Powdered sugar                 
 
  "In 1966 a chocolate cake called the Tunnel of Fudge Cake, made with a
  boxed frosting mix, won the Pillsbury BAKE-OFF Contest.  Although the
  frosting mix was discontinued, Pillsbury continued to receive so many
  requests for the cake that the company developed a scratch recipe to
  simulate the original.  Here it is:"
  
  1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 12-cup bundt pan or 10" angel
  food tube pan.  Dust with flour; tap out excess. 2. In a large bowl, beat
  together butter and sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed until
  light and fluffly, 1 to 2 minutes.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating well
  after each addition.  Gradually add 2 cups powdered sugar, beating until
  well blended.  By hand, stir in flour, 3/4 cup cocoa, and nuts; mix until
  well blended. Spoon batter into prepared pan and spread evenly. 3. Bake 58
  to 62 minutes.  Since this cake has a soft tunnel of fudge, ordinary
  doneness test cannot be used. Accurate oven temperature and baking time are
  critical.  Let cake cool upright in pan on a rack for 1 hour; then invert
  onto serving plate and let cool completely. 4. To make glaze, in a small
  bowl, combine remaining 3/4 cup powdered sugar, remaining 1/4 cup cocoa,
  and milk.  Mix until well blended. Spoon glaze over top of cool cake,
  allowing some to run down sides. Store cake tightly covered.
  
  ** Nuts are essential for the success of this recipe.

      1 c  Milk                              1/2 ts Vanilla Extract
 
  Yield:  About 20 "Pies"
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease 3 or 4 baking sheets and set
  aside.
  
  TO MAKE THE PIES:
  
  Beat the sugar and shortening in the large bowl of an electric mixer until
  well blended.  Mix the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt in a medium-sized
  bowl with a wire whisk until light and thoroughly combined. (Using the wire
  whisk to blend the dry ingredients, in this case, makes sifting
  unnecessary.)  With the electric mixer running on low speed, add the flour
  mixture and milk alternately to the sugar mixture, starting and ending with
  the flour mixture, beating well after each addition. beat in the vanilla.
  
  Drop the batter by heaping measuring TBLS. 2 inches apart on the prepared
  baking sheets.  (The little cakes will be about 2 1/2 inches in diameter
  after baking)  You should have about 40 cakes.  Bake for 15 minutes or
  until cakes spring back when touched lightly.  Remove to wire racks to
  cool.
  
  TO MAKE THE FILLING:
  
  In a large bowl, combine the butter, marshmallow creme, sugar, shortening
  and vanilla.  Beat for 2 minutes, using an electric mixer set on high
  speed, until light and fluffy.
  
  ASSEMBLY:
  
  Place about 1 TBS of filling on the flat sides of half the cakes. Top with
  the remaining cakes and press together so that the filling squashes out the
  sides a little.
  
  NOTE:
  
  Because of all the butter in the filling, these pies should not be held at
  room temperature indefinitely.  Pies that are not to be eaten soon after
  baking should be wrapped in plastic film and refrigerated or frozen for
  future use.

      Title: Caramels Au Chocolat (Chocolate Caramels)
 Categories: Chocolate, Candies
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3 c  Milk                            3 1/4 oz Chocolate in tablets
     13 oz Powdered sugar                  1 1/2 oz Butter
           Eggsize piece of glucose          1/2    Vanilla bean
 
  Put milk, sugar, vanilla bean and glucose into a stewpan. Put the chocolate
  into a round-bottomed copper pan and melt it slowly on the stove.
  Meanwhile, heat the mixture in the stewpan, not letting it boil, since you
  merely want to melt the sugar and glucose. When completely melted, pour
  this mixture, bit by bit, into the chocolate, while stirring. When
  thoroughly mixed, cook at moderate heat, constantly stirring. Cook to the
  'ball' stage. (To test the stage of cooking by finger, dip the thumb and
  index finger into cold water, then into the mixture, bringing the 2 fingers
  together and dipping them again into water. This should be done quickly to
  avoid burning. The mixture forms a ball that can be rolled with the tip of
  the fingers.) Remove from the fire, add the butter, mix well, and pour onto
  an oiled marble slab in an oiled, iron framework. Let cool and cut.

  be stirred smooth and is glossy; stirring once or twice.

  each coconut ball, making sure chocolate coats and letting excess chocolate
  drip down onto waxed paper. While chocolate coating is still soft, lightly
  press whole almond on top of each. Let stand to set or place in
  refrigerator. Store in a single layer in airtight container. Keeps best if
  refrigerated. Makes 26.

      4 c  Sugar                               2 tb Butter, plus extra for
      3    Squares dark baking                      -greasing platters
           -chocolate                          1 c  Chopped nuts
  1 1/3 c  Milk                            1 1/3 ts Vanilla
 
  In a heavy saucepan mix together the sugar, chocolate, and milk. Place the
  pan over high heat and stir constantly until the choclate is melted and the
  sugar is dissolved. Bring to a full boil, and lower the heat so the candy
  continues to boil gently, not vigorously. Stir no more. Put a candy
  thermometer into the center of the mixture and cook until the temperature
  reaches exactly 232 F. Meanwhile, butter a large platter (turkey size) and
  a flat pan about 11 by 13 inches. When the fudge reaches 232 F., pour it
  into the readied platter - do not scrape the pan, but let it drip out. Dot
  with 2 tablespoons butter and let the mixture cool until the platter feels
  cool underneath. Add vanilla. Take a large slotted spoon and start to stir
  the liquidy mixture - it will take about 15 or 20 minutes. You will see a
  steady change from dark to light color, from glossy to dull, from liquid to
  solid. When the fudge begins to get dull, add the nuts and mix in
  thoroughly. Put fudge into the large buttered pan and press into shape with
  the flat of your palms. Cut into squares; store in airtight container if
  there's any left.

      Title: Truffes Au Chocolat (Chocolate Truffles)
 Categories: Chocolate, Candies
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3 oz Chocolate                           2 oz Powdered sugar
  1 1/2 oz Butter                              2 tb Fresh cream
 
  Preparation: Put cream, butter and grated chocolate into a pan. The
  chocolate need not be grated fine. The cream can be replaced by skimming
  the top off raw milk poured into a wide basin and allowed to settle. Melt
  butter, chocolate, and cream in a double boiler, stirring to mix well. When
  melted, remove the double boiler from the fire, leaving the hot water in
  the bottom pan to keep it warm. Sift the powdered sugar in slowly, so that
  it will not form lumps, stirring constantly. Let stand 24 hr. in a cool
  place. (In winter, 12 hr. in a cold room will do.) At the end of this time,
  cut a piece of this chocolate about the size of a small nut, using a knife
  or spoon. Roll it into a ball in the palm of the hand until the outside of
  the bonbon begins to melt a little. Then roll it in grated or granulated
  chocolate, which will stick to it perfectly. Let stand 2 hr. before
  serving, but in a place that is not too cold, because these truffles are
  better when they are a little soft. Instead of rolling them into balls, you
  can also shape them to look more like truffles.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 lb Good chocolate                      3 oz Butter
           About 1/2 glass water           1 1/2 oz Praline paste
      3    Egg yolks                      
 
  Slowly melt the chocolate in the water, bring to a gentle boil, remove from
  the fire, and add the yolks, beating with a spatula, then replace on a low
  fire to poach the eggs in the chocolate. Do not stop beating. Remove from
  the fire and add the butter and the praline paste. Let cool, beating from
  time to time (this cooling takes a rather long time). When the mixture
  begins to solidify, take some with a spoon, place it in some grated
  chocolate (prepared in advance), and shape to resemble real truffles. These
  truffles keep a week. To keep a longer time, substitute vegetable
  shortening for the butter.

 Categories: Cakes, Sauces
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      2    9-Inch Layers Of Choc. Cake       1/3 c  Light Corn Syrup
      1    Fudge Icing (Recipe)                1 c  Brown Sugar, Firmly Packed
      1    Caramel Sauce (Recipe)              2 ts Butter
  1 1/2 c  Cashews, Roasted, Unsalted        1/8 ts Salt
      2 c  Heavy Cream                       1/3 c  Heavy Cream
  2 1/2 lb Semisweet Chocolate            
 
  FOR CAKE: Slice round cake layers horizontally in half to make 4 round cake
  layers.  Place 1 layer on plate and top with Fudge Icing, Caramel Sauce and
  Cashews. Repeat with next 2 cake layers.  Place final cake layer on top,
  frost top and sides of cake with Fudge Icing and cover sides of cake with
  chopped cashews. FUDGE ICING: Bring cream to boil. Stir in chocolate until
  melted and smooth. This will be very soft but will harden when cooled.
  Refrigerate until workable consistency. NOTE: The time it takes to get to a
  workable consistency depends on the weather. This is much like making fudge
  candy. The author, (Arlene Lightsey), made this sauce on a cool, clear day
  and had no problem. CARAMEL SAUCE: Bring first 4 ingredients to boil and
  reduce to thick syrup. Very carefully, (because it will splatter), add
  cream. Refrigerate until cool. Recipe from Pastry Chef Jenny Mattingsley,
  of Pour la France, 7959 Broadway, San Antonio, Texas......

      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Sorrel                            1/4    Red onion, chopped
      4 tb Finely minced shallots              1 tb Dry mustard
      4 tb Pine nuts, ground                   1 ts Salt
      3 tb Chopped parsley                     1 ts Black pepper
      3 tb Chopped chives                           Pinch cayenne
           Grated peel of 4 oranges          3/4 c  Olive oil
 
  1.  Wash the sorrel and dry it well, by hand or in a salad spinner. Chop
    the sorrel coarsely, and again squeeze away any liquid.
  
  2.  Blend the sorrel, shallots, pine nuts, parsley, chives, orange peel
    and onion in a food processor or blender.  (If using a blender, make
    sure these ingredients are already finely chopped.)
  
  3.  Add dry mustard, salt, pepper and cayenne, and mix again.  SLOWLY
    drizzle in the oil while the blade is moving.  Transfer to tempered
    glass jars and store in refrigerator (for up to 8 to 10 weeks) or in
    the freezer for up to a year.
  
  NOTES:  Sorrel's peak season is summer, although you can find hothouse
        sorrel year round in some stores.  You may reduce the amount of
        orange peel by 1/4 or 1/2 if you'd like to emphasize the sorrel
        or other flavors.  Walnuts or almonds may be substituted for
        the pine nuts.

      Title: Marinara Sauce (Food & Wine, 1990)
 Categories: Italian, Sauces
      Yield: 3 servings
 
    1/4 c  Extra-virgin olive oil                   14-oz. can of Italian plum
      2 sm Garlic cloves, minced OR                 Tomatoes, lightly drained
           Crushed and peeled*                      And finely chopped
  2 1/2 lb Plum tomatoes, peeled,            1/4 ts Salt
           Seeded and finely chopped         1/2 ts Pepper
           OR one 35-oz. can and one           2 tb Shredded fresh basil
 
  1.  In a medium nonreactive skillet, heat the oil over moderately low heat.
  Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until golden, about 4 minutes. Discard
  the garlic if desired. 2. Add the tomatoes, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring
  occasionally, until thickened, about 30 minutes. Soft bits of tomato will
  remain, and the sauce should be thick enough to hold its shape on a spoon.
  (The sauce can be made ahead and kept covered in the refrigerator for up to
  4 days or frozen for up to 3 months.) Stir in the basil just before
  serving. * Crushed, peeled garlic cloves can be discarded after browning
  for a very subtle flavor or left in and discarded at the end of cooking for
  a slightly more emphatic garlic taste. More often than not I used minced
  garlic and leave it in.  This gives the sauce a strong garlic flavor. NOTE:
  Many southern Italians refer to a quick tomato sauce as "marinara" because
  it could be made at a moment's notice by a fisherman's wife upon her
  husband's return.  Serve over breaded or fried foods or mixed into baked
  pasta dishes or spaghetti, it is the most common southern Italian tomato
  sauce.  I like to make a simple marinara, which I can later adjust by
  adding sauteed onions, other fresh herbs, such as oregano, parsley,
  marjoram or rosemary, or by adding hot peppers. Food and Wine, August, 1990

 Categories: Italian, Sauces
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 tb Olive Oil                           1 ts Sugar (optional)
      1    Garlic clove finely chopped         1 tb Basil, Oregano, or Marjoram
     16 oz Can tomato sauce                         - finely chopped
      1 sm Onion - finely chopped                   Pepper - freshly ground
      2 tb Fresh Parsley - freshly                  Salt to taste (optional)
           Chopped and divided            
 
  When fresh tomatoes aren't in season, here's a quick way to doctor up
  canned tomato sauce. In a Non-Stick VISIONS 1-quart saucepan, heat olive
  oil.  Add onion and garlic and saute over medium heat until onion is pale
  golden. (DON'T BURN IT!) Add tomato sauce and a tablespoon of the parsley
  and cook on medium-low heat about 15 minutes to blend the flavors. Taste.
  If too acidic, add a teaspoon of sugar. Add freshly ground pepper to taste
  and salt, if needed. Finish by stirring in another tablespoon of parsley
  and  your choice of Basil, Oregano, or Marjoram. This sauce came from the
  cookbook included with the new CORNING Ware VISIONS Non-Stick 1-quart Sauce
  Pan.

  stir in the cheeses. Blend thoroughly.
  
  For parsley pesto, substitute 2 c. of parsley for the spinach.

  "Your party will be the best one of the year when you serve this special
  dip baked inside a loaf of bread. It will be the centerpiece of the table
  and the centerpiece of the party, too."
  
  drained and cut into quarters Garlic bread for serving
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cut a hole about 5 inches in diameter in the
  top of the bread. (If you wish, make a decorative zigzag pattern.) Reserve
  crusty part to make top for loaf. Scoop out most of the soft inside portion
  of the loaf and save for another purpose, such as stuffing or bread crumbs.
  In a skillet, saute' the scallions and garlic in the butter until scallions
  wilt. Do not burn! Place the cream cheese in a medium sized bowl; add the
  scallions, garlic, sour cream, and Cheddar cheese. Mix well. Fold in the
  artichoke hearts. Fill hollowed-out bread with this mixture. Replace top of
  bread and wrap in a double thickness of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Bake for
  about 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hours. Remove foil and top of bread and serve, using
  thin slices of warm garlic bread as dippers.
  
  Note: The best part of this dish is when the dip is gone and all you have
  left is the breadd, which is soaked in all those delicious ingredients.
  Just break the bread up and pass it around!

      Title: Basic Crepe Recipe
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Flour                               3    Eggs
      1 ts Sugar                           1 1/2 c  Milk
    1/8 ts Salt                                2 tb Butter or oil; melted/cooled
 
  Mixing crepes by hand.
  
  Sift the dry ingredients into a bowl.  Break the eggs into another bowl and
  mix until yolks and whites are blended.  Make a hole in the middle of the
  dry ingredients and pour in beaten eggs.  (French chefs often break the
  eggs right into the dry ingredients but this makes mixing more difficult.
  
  Stir the flour mixture into the eggs little by little.  The dough will be
  difficult to work and it may be necessary to add a little milk (or whatever
  liquid is used in the particular recipe) to incorporate all the flour. Add
  the liquid a spoonful at a time and mix it in thoroughly before adding more
  liquid.  When the mixture becomes easy to work (when about half of the
  liquid has been used) the remainder can be added in two portions.
  
  Add melted butter (and flavorings if indicated).
  
  Mix again, cover and set aside for at least an hour but not more than 6
  hours at room temperature.  Crepe batter can be held overnight in the
  refrigerater.  If necessary, the crepe batter can be cooked immediately,
  but the "resting" time allows the flour to absorb more liquids, makes the
  mabber easier to handle, and gives the crepes more flavor.  Since flours
  vary in their ability to absorb liquid, if the crepe batter seems too thick
  when you are ready to cook it, a small amount of extra liquid can be added
  at this time.  The consistency could be at least as thin as heavy cream.

           Beaver Tail                    
 
  This tid-bit of the old time trappers will be tasted by few of the younger
  generation. Broil the beaver tail over hot coals for a few minutes (or in
  one of those new electric ovens). The rough scaly hide will blister and
  come off, leaving the tail clean, white and solid. Then roast or boil until
  tender. This is considered very strengthening food (use only young beaver).
  For a special treat, cool, souse in vinegar, add raw onion rings, salt and
  pepper to taste.

  COMBINE ALL INGREDIENTS for the crepes, except the butter. Whisk well and
  pass through a fine strainer. Let rest 1 hour. Add butter before cooking
  the crepes. Cook the crepes and be careful not to brown them. Lay the crepe
  out on a piece of parchment or a clean towel (don't lay out more than 12 at
  a time or they will dry out). Fill with a spoonful of caviar and sour
  cream. Pull the edges of the crepes up to form small purses and tie with a
  chive. Serve warm or at room temperature, lightly brushed with butter.
  These crepes can also be rolled or folded in the more traditional manner if
  forming the purses seems like a daunting task. The result is beautiful,
  however, and worth the extra effort.
  
  This elegant recipe comes from Katherine Alford, chief instructor at the
  New York Cooking School. Katherine used to be the chef at the Quilted
  Giraffe in New York. These crepes are a signature dish of that restaurant.

      1 tb Olive oil                          16 oz Can salt free whole tomatoes
      3 md Garlic cloves, chopped fine         1 c  (about 48) medium sized

           -chopped                                 -black olives,drained and
 
  Most of us tend to think of olives as a salty-fatty food.  But it's
  possible to buy low salt black olives, featured in the Mediterranean style
  sauce, that have all the good flavor without all of the salt. Yes, the
  capers that lend spark to the sauce are themselves salty; but you can cut
  down on their saltiness by choosing a brand that ranks salt further down,
  and thus in lesser concentration-on the ingredients list,and then draining
  and rinsing the capers well before adding them.  Serve with medium to large
  strands, ribbons, or shapes.
  
  broken by hand or chopped into about 4 pieces each 3 tbsp capers, drained
  and rinsed 1 tbsp balsamic or good quality red wine vinegar 1 tbsp double
  concentrate tomato paste 2 tsp sugar 1/2 tbsp dried oregano
  
  In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the olive oil with the garlic and
  onion over moderate heat.  When they sizzle, add the tomatoes, breaking
  them up with your hands.  Then stir in the remaining ingredients. Simmer
  the sauce until it is thick but still slightly liquid, 5-7 minutes.  Serve
  over cooked pasta. Serves 4.

      2 tb Unsalted butter, melted,            1 c  All-purpose flour
           Plus additional for brushing        1 ts Salt
           -the griddle                        2 lg Eggs, separated
      1 c  Buckwheat flour (available        3/4 c  Well-chilled heavy cream
 
  (Buckwheat Yeast Pancakes With Three Caviars) from 1989
  
  a 1/4-ounce package (2 1/2 teaspoons) active dry yeast about 2 cups sour
  cream as an accompaniment about 4 ounces each black caviar, golden caviar,
  and salmon roe
  
  In a large bowl proof the yeast with 1/2 tablespoon of the sugar in 1/3 cup
  lukewarm water for 10 minutes, or until it is foamy. Stir in 1 cup of the
  milk, heated to lukewarm, the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons
  of the butter, and the buckwheat flour, beat the batter for 1 minute, and
  let it rise, covered with plastic wrap, in a warm place for 2 hours or
  chill it, covered tightly, overnight. (Chilling overnight produces a
  tangier flavor. Let the batter come to room temperature before continuing
  with the recipe.) Stir in the remaining 1 cup milk, heated to lukewarm, the
  all-purpose flour, the salt, and the yolks, beat the mixture for 1 minute,
  and let it rise, covered with the plastic wrap, in a warm place for 1 hour,
  or until it is double in bulk and bubbly. In a bowl beat the cream until it
  holds soft peaks and fold it into the batter. In a metal bowl beat the egg
  whites until they just hold stiff peaks and fold them into the batter
  gently but thoroughly.
  
  Heat a griddle or large skillet over moderate heat until it is hot, brush
  it lightly with the additional melted butter, and spoon tablespoons of the
  batter onto the griddle, spreading them to form 3-inch rounds. Cook the
  blini for 1 minute on each side, or until the undersides are golden.
  Transfer the blini as they are cooked to a platter and keep them warm,
  covered with a kitchen towel. Make blini with the remaining batter in the
  same manner, brushing the griddle lightly with the butter as necessary. The
  blini may be made 2 days in advance and kept covered and chilled. Reheat
  the blini, covered with foil, in a 350~ F. oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or
  until they are warm, or microwave them on a microwave-safe platter, covered
  with microwave-safe plastic wrap, at high power (100%) for 2 minutes, or
  until they are warm.
  
  Arrange 3 or 4 blini on each of 18 small plates, top them with some of the
  sour cream, and arrange some of the caviar decoratively on the sour cream.
  Serves 18 with blini to spare.

      Title: Cheese Crackers
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 c  Grated sharp cheddar cheese           pn Paprika
    1/2 c  Flour, part for rolling               pn Cayenne pepper
      2 tb Margarine or butter                 2 tb Water
    1/4 ts Salt                           
 
  Mix all together in a bowl.  Original directions suggested shaping into a
  roll 1 1/2 inch wide, chilling at least 2 hours wrapped in wax paper and
  cutting in thin slices to make 1 dozen or more crackers.  This would
  produce neatly shaped crackers, possibly thicker than desired.
  
  By rolling very thin, this amount of dough will make small crackers about
  1/2 inch apart to cover 1 1/2 small cookie sheets.  They do puff up while
  baking.  May be cut quickly in random small shapes with a plastic knife.
  
  Suggested toppings coarse salt (made them too salty), garlic salt, celery
  salt, curry powder, or freshly ground black pepper.  If the dough is very
  dry after rolling, brush tops with water before salting.  If it is soft,
  sprinkle lightly and press the salt into the crackers.
  
  Bake 5 minutes at 425 F or until browned.

 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 20 servings
 
      1 lb Puff pastry                       3/4 c  Parmesan; grated
 
      1.  Roll out puff pastry dough into a rectangle 20 by 24 inches.
  Sprinkle half of the Parmesan evenly over the dough and gently press cheese
  into the dough with the rolling pin.
      2.  Fold the dough in half crosswise, roll it out again to 20 by 24
  inches, and sprinkle on remaining cheese.
      3.  Using a sharp thin knife, cut the dough into 1/3-inch strips. Take
  each strip by its end and twist until evenly corkscrewed.  Lay the twists
  of dough on an ungreased baking sheet, arranged so they are just touching
  each other; this will prevent untwisting.
      4.  Set the baking sheet in the middle of a preheated 350F oven and
  bake until the straws are crisp, puffed brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
      5.  Remove from the oven, cool for 5 minutes, then cut apart with a
  sharp knife.  Finish cooling the straws on a rtack, then store them in an
  airtight tin or plastic bag until serving time.  They will stay fresh for
  about 1 week. About 20 straws. Arrange a basketful on the bar when
  entertaining and watch them disappear! Source: The Silver Palate Cookbook

      Title: Chesapeake Bay Crab Cakes
 Categories: Appetizers, Fish/sea
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 ts Sharp prepared mustard              1 lb Lump crabmeat, picked clean
      1 tb Freshly squeezed lemon juice      1/2 c  Dry, unflavored bread crumbs
      6 tb Olive oil, divided                  1 pn Of cayenne pepper
    1/2 ts Salt                                4 tb Butter
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper    
 
  Chesapeake Bay Crab Cakes
  
  Parsley, lemon wedges, tartar sauce as desired
  
  Using an electric blender or wire whisk, beat together mustard, lemon juice
  and egg until thoroughly combined.  While  beating vigorously, gradually
  pour 4 Tbs of olive oil  into  the  egg mixture in a thin stream. When
  smooth and creamy, stir in salt and pepper.
  
  Gently fold in crabmeat, then bread crumbs and cayenne  pepper. Shape into
  8 patties, each about a half-inch thick. They  will want to fall apart, but
  that's the idea of a good  crab  cake. You want only enough non-crab stuff
  to just barely bind them.
  
  Melt  butter together with 2 Tbs of olive oil in  skillet  over medium
  heat.  When butter sizzles (but before it burns!) gently ease the crab
  cakes into the skillet  to  cook.   When  well browned (2 to 3 minutes),
  gently turn and  cook  other  side. Drain on paper towels. Serve
  immediately.

      Title: Cold Crabmeat Nacho
 Categories: Appetizers, Fish/sea
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     24 oz Cream cheese                             Salt and pepper, to taste
      2 tb Mayonnaise; the real thing          1 cn Black olives; finely
        ds Tabasco                                  -chopped (16 oz. can)
    1/4 c  Green onions; minced              1/2 lb Crabmeat; flaked
    1/4 c  Celery; coarsely chopped            1    Nacho cheese flavor doritos
        ds Paprika                        
 
      The best way to prepare this recipe in a food processor, because it
  chops the ingredients finely enough and blends them together for you. But
  if a food processor is not handy, you can use a blender and a chef's
  kniofe.  It will still come out great, no matter how you do it!
      First, mix the cream cheese to a pasty consistency.  It has to be soft
  and pliable.  THen, in a large mixing bowl, whip together the cheese and
  the mayonnaise until the mixture is smooth.  Toss in the Tabasco at this
  point and blend it in, too.  Next, add the minced onions, the celery, the
  seasonings, the finely chopped black olives, and the crabmeat. Just put
  them all together -- it's not necessary to add them one at a time. But is
  *is* necessary to blend them all *gently*. If you get rough, you'll smash
  the ingredients and you'll lose the crispness.
      When you're ready to serve, lay out the *whole* bag of Doritos on a
  pizza pan and stuff each one, heaping on the crabmeat mixture and
  sprinkling the tops with paprika.  To increase the flavor, put the stuffed
  chips in the refrigerator for an hour or two. Author's note: ...While
  crabmeat is used in the original dish, you can also substitute chopped
  shrimp or crawfish for the crabmeat, and the basic mix is also excellent
  for stuffing avocados, tomatoes, celery stalks, and just about anyting your
  taste dictates. Note from me: I don't care for Nacho Cheese Flavor Doritos
  but instead these are great with the unsalted style chips you get with
  salsa at Mexican restaurants. Source: Frank Davis Seafood Notebook

      Title: Country Pate
 Categories: Appetizers, Pork/ham, Veal
      Yield: 3 servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Boneless pork, ground fine               Salt
           -twice                                   Freshly ground black pepper
      1 lb Boneless veal, ground fine          2 lg Onions, sliced thin
           -twice                              2 sm Cloves garlic, halved
    3/4 c  Dry white wine                      1 lb Fresh pork fatback, sliced
      2 tb Brandy                                   -thin
      2 tb Oil                                 1    Cornichon pickle for garnish
 
  Servings: Makes about 3 lbs From: Sallie Krebs
  
  DIRECTIONS: In a large bowl, combine the pork and veal. Mix the wine,
  brandy and oil with salt and pepper to taste, and pour the mixture over the
  meats. Scatter the onions and garlic on top. Cover the bowl tightly and
  refrigerate it for at least 24 hours.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375-F. Discard the onions, but put the garlic through a
  press and knead it into the meats together with the wine mixture. Break off
  a small piece of meat and fry it in a lightly oiled skillet over moderate
  heat for 3 or 4 minutes, or until its juices run clear, without a trace of
  pink. Taste the piece and, if you like, add more garlic, salt and pepper.
  (Pork is unsafe to eat uncooked; do not taste the meats raw.)
  
  Slightly overlapping the slices, line the bottom and sides of a 2-quart
  terrine mold or a 7 1/2 x 3 1/2 x 2 1/2 inch loaf pan with the fatback.
  Pack the meat mixture into the mold, and arrange the remaining slices of
  fatback on top of it. Fit foil over the mold, or cover the meat mixture
  with foil and a lid. To let steam escape, pierce a hole in the foil with a
  skewer. If you are using a lid, insert the skewer through its hole to
  puncture the foil.
  
  Set the mold on a rack in a large pan or dish. Place them all in the oven,
  and pour enough almost-boiling water into the pan to cover 2/3 of the mold.
  Bake for 2 hours or until the pate shrinks slightly from the sides of the
  mold and the surrounding fat and juices are a clear yellowish white with no
  traces of pink. Or insert a meat thermometer; it should register 160-F when
  the pate is done.
  
  Take the pate from the oven, but leave the foil in place. Set the pate on a
  rack to cool to room temperature. Then put another pan with a heavy can or
  weights inside it, or even a brick, on top of the pate to compact the
  meats. Chill the pate thoroughly (overnight is best) with the weights in
  place. Before serving, cut the cornichon into a fan shape, slicing
  lengthwise through the pickle 4 or 5 times to within 1/2 inch of one end.
  Spread the slices into a fan, and garnish the pate with it.

      1 ts Curry powder                      1/2 c  Margarine or butter, melted
 
  Filling: In a small mixing bowl stir together yogurt, cocnut, peanuts,

  Unfold phyllo dough.  Place one sheet of phyllo dough on a
  waxed-paper-lined cutting board.  Cover remaining sheets with a damp paper
  towel or cloth.  Keep covered to prevent drying.  Generously brush with
  some of the margarine or butter.  Top with another sheet of phyllo, then
  brush with more of the margarine or butter.  Repeat with a third sheet of
  phyllo and margarine or butter.
  
  Using a sharp knife, cut the stack of buttered phyllo sheets into twelve
  4-inch squares.  Place about 2 teaspoons of the filling in the center of
  each square.  For each bundle, bring the 4 corners together; 1 pinch and
  twist slightly.
  
  Repeat with the remaining phyllo dough, margarine or butter, and filling to
  make 24 bundles total.  Arrange bundles on an ungreased parchment- or
  foil-lined baking sheet.
  
  Bake, uncovered, in a 375 degree F oven for 18 to 20 minutes or till
  golden.  Serve immediately.  Makes 24 bundles.
  
  To freeze: Prepare phyllo bundles as directed, except do not bake. Freeze
  the unbaked bundles on a baking sheet. Transfer to a storage container;
  seal, label, and place in the freezer.  To serve, place frozen bundles on a
  parchment- or foil-lined baking sheet.  Bake, uncovered, in a 375 degree F
  oven for 18 to 20 minutes or till golden.

      Title: Dill Dip in Rye Bread
 Categories: Dips
      Yield: 20 servings
 
      1 c  Mayonnaise                          2 tb Onion Flakes
      1 c  Sour Cream                          2 tb Parsley Flakes
      2 tb Dill weed                      
 
  Start the day before, or atleast early in the day to serve in the evening.
  The dry ingredients need time to soften, and get friendly.  Mix all
  ingredients and refrigerate over night.
  
  Carve out the bread  to make a bowl, saving the bread to dip into the
  sauce.
  
  When ready to serve, put the dip inside the bread, arange the bread pieces
  around the 'bowl'. When the pieces are gone, slice, rip, or tear the
  remaining crust and eat.
  
  We had a bakery in Baltimore that made a great Sweedish/Onion Rye, although
  that was the name on the bread, they claimed that there was nothing special
  about it. I have served it with plain 'store bought' rye, the round loaves
  and with my own home made rye.

      Title: Dippy Snacks
 Categories: Dips
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Stick (1/2 cup) butter or           1 c  Cottage cheese
           -margarine, softened           
 
  With carrots, celery, green pepper strips, cucumber slices, cherry
  tomatoes, cauliflower pieces or crackers, try any of the following:
  
  CHEESE SPREAD
  
  garlic powder
  
  Blend shortening with cottage cheese. A blender or baby food grinder will
  give you a smoother consistency than whipping with a fork. Add garlic
  powder to taste. Refrigerate in a covered container.
  
  DIP IT AGAIN
  
  1 (8 oz) container of plain yogurt 1 cup sour cream 1 pkg onion soup mix
  
  Combine and chill before serving.
  
  BETTER-WITH-BUTTERMILK DIP
  
  1 cup buttermilk 2 cups mayonnaise 1 cup sour cream or yogurt 1 envelope
  Ranch style dressing mix
  
  Stir together and chill. For use as salad dressing, substitute a second cup
  of buttermilk for the sour cream or yogurt.
  
  Hint: Use cucumber "coins" instead of crackers.
  
  OTHER QUICK DIPPIES that make up in small quantities:
  
  * Blend 1/3 to 1/2 of a mashed banana with 2 or 3 tsps of mayonnaise.
  
  * Whipe together 1 tsp of smooth peanut butter with 1 tsp of mayonnaise. If
  still too thick, add a few drops of milk.
  
  * Mix 1/2 tsp of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp of honey or sugar to 1 or 2 tsp of
  mayonnaise.
  
  CUTTING UP WITH KIDS
  
  Have your children help you cut up green onions, parsley, lettuce, cheese
  slices, fruit, etc., using a scissors instead of a knife. Using a scissors
  helps coordination (YES!) and keeps them busy for a _long_ time!
  
  CHERRY BALLS
  
  Stuff whole (or half) cherry tomatoes with cream cheese, a cheese spread,
  egg salad or tuna salad.
  
  Actually thinking of snacks as hors d'oeuvres - rather than desserts - will
  open up a whole new way of looking at this category.

      3    Garlic cloves; chopped                   Salt to taste
 
  A favorite Valencian tapa as well as a popular main dish, especially along
  the Costa Blanca. A cold beer might go best with this piquant tapa.
  
  Clean and skin eels and cut into 1- to 1 1/2-inch pieces. Heat 1 tablespoon
  olive oil in a casserole or skillet, add paprika, and stir in enough water
  to cover eels. Bring to a boil and add pieces of eel. Meanwhile with a
  mortar and pestle or in an electric blender crush garlic, almonds, parsley,
  and saffron with enough olive oil to make a smooth paste. Stir mixture into
  casserole, add salt to taste, and cook for about 20 minutes or until eels
  are done. Add more water if sauce thickens. Serve hot.
  
  Variation: For an all-in-one meal or a main course, add peas, chopped
  carrots, or new potatoes (or all three) and serve over rice, as they do in
  Valencia.

      1    Clove garlic, minced           
 
  Servings: Makes 50 1/2-inch empanadas
  
  Notes: Empanadas are Brazil's national appetizer, tiny pies filled with
  chicken olives, and peas. Belita's are famous all over Brazil. Empanadas
  are traditionally made in special molds that are almost as deep as they are
  wide. If they are unavailable, any small tartlet molds will do. "The secret
  to making good dough," says Belita, "is to massage it, not knead it." It
  may look as if she's making mud pies, but the results are truly superb.
  
  For the dough:
  
  To prepare the dough: Place the flour in a large mixing bowl and make a
  well in the center. Place the butter, shortening, eggs, salt, and 1 cup
  water in the well. Using one hand to mix, squeeze these ingredients through
  your fingers to make a paste. Gradually work in the flour, squeezing the
  dough between your fingers to mix it. Add water as necessary; the dough
  should be quite soft. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes while you prepare
  the filling.
  
  Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Saute the onion and garlic over medium
  heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until soft but not brown. Add the chicken, bay
  leaf, tomato paste, salt, and pepper, plus water just to cover. Bring to a
  boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the chicken is
  cooked. Skim off the fat that rises to the surface. Remove the chicken,
  then strain and reserve the broth.
  
  When the chicken is cool enough to handle, discard the skin and remove the
  meat from the bone. Finely shred the meat with your fingers or in a food
  processor. Stir in the flour, peas, and olives. Stir in 3 to 4 Tbsp broth;
  the filling should be moist but not runny. Add enough cayenne to give the
  chicken a little bite.
  
  Pinch off cherry-sized pieces of dough and use them to line the tartlet
  molds. Belita pushes the dough in with her thumb. The dough should just
  reach over the top of the mold. Place a spoonful of filling in each crust.
  
  Roll out the remaining dough and cut out tops for the empanadas. Try to
  capture an air bubble when you place the top over the filling; according to
  Belita, this is what makes the pies light. Seal the tartlets by pinching
  together the top and bottom crust. Note: The empanadas can be prepared
  ahead to this stage and frozen.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350-F. Brush the tops with egg glaze. Bake for 30
  minutes or until golden brown. Unmold and serve.

      Title: Empanadas - S. American
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 1 servings
 
-----------------------------------DOUGH-----------------------------------
      2 c  Flour, all purpose                1/2 ts Salt
    2/3 c  Shortening or lard                  6 tb Water

-------------------------------DESSERT FRUIT-------------------------------
  2 1/2 c  Fruit                               1 c  Sugar
      1 ts Cinnamon                          1/2 ts Nutmeg

------------------------------CARNE ( ANY MEAT------------------------------
      1    Onion                               1    Pepper, green
      1 tb Olive oil                           8 oz Tomato paste
      4 oz Water                               1 tb Vinegar
           Sal and Pepper to taste             1 lb Beef, sliced thinly
 
  DOUGH:
       In a medium mixing bowl, combine flour and salt.  Cut in the
  shortening or lard till pieces are the size of small peas.  Add a small
  amount of water to slightly moisten.  Form dough into a ball.  Roll out the
  dough to about 1/8 thick and cut into 4" circles.  Flour lightly both side
  of circles and then stack up for later use.
  
  DESSERT FILLING:  Just about any kind of fruit or melon may be used.
  Combine ingredients and heat to thoroughly mix, coarse chop, so that
  filling is chunky but bite-sized.  Pumpkins is very good!!
  
  CARNE:  Just about any kind of meat may be used, depending on availability.
  The sauce seems to be the only fairly consistent thing. Saute the onion and
  green pepper in olive oil.  Add remaining ingredients and cook for 20
  minutes.  ( In S.A. this is continually cooked and prepared on the back
  burner, often being used and added to for several months at a time. It
  developes a flavor all its own...)  Add meat and coat thoroughly with the
  sauce.
  
  COOKING:  Add a large spoonfull of one of the above mixtures to the center
  of a dough circle.  Place another circle on top.  Fasten the two circles
  together by reeding the edges with a fork.  These may then be baked, at
  around 350 degrees F until brown, deep fat fried, fried, cooked or heated
  on a barbecue.  They may also be wrapped in banana husks, well moistened
  corn husks, etc.  The object is to heat thoroughly, cooking the meat and
  browning the outsides so they are dry enough to hold together.

      Title: Fried Leeks with Tarragon
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Leeks, about 1-in thick,            1 ts Tarragon
           -white parts only                        Flour; for dredging
      1    Egg                                      Oil for frying
           Salt & freshly ground pepper             -canola, lt. olive or peanut
      1 ts Finely chopped parsley                   Tarragon vinegar
 
  TRIM THE LEEKS: Cut off the roots but leave enough so that the leaves
  remain joined at the base. Slice them in half lengthwise down to the base
  but not through it, and rinse them well. Steam them over boiling water
  until they are tender when pierced with a knife, about 10 minutes, then set
  on a towel to cool and drain dry. Beat the egg on a plate and season with
  salt and pepper. Add the parsley and half the tarragon. Dip the leeks into
  the egg and slosh them around so that they are well covered, then dip them
  in flour to coat. Heat enough oil in a heavy pan to cover the bottom
  generously. When it is hot enough to sizzle a drop of water, add the leeks.
  Fry them, turning them frequently until they're nicely browned all over.
  Set them on a towel to drain briefly. Serve with the remaining tarragon
  sprinkled over the top and a cruet of vinegar on the side.

      2 c  Dry chick peas                           Onion
      1 lb Jar tahini                               Water from cooked beans
      3    Garlic cloves                       2 ts Cumin, powdered (optional)

  Soak beans overnight.  Drain and place on cookie sheet.  Freeze several
  hours.  cook frozen beans in double amount of water with onion in it or
  cook in a pressure cooker instead of freezing first.  Blend cooked beans
  (pureeing while still warm makes blending easier) and onion a little at a
  time, using as much water as necessary to keep blender going.  Add garlic
  cloves, soy sauce and lemon juice to taste along with beans.  If you're
  using cumin, add it now. When all beans have been blended with other
  ingredients to a thick sauce, place in a large bowl. Add one jar of tahini
  and mix well, adding more tamari, garlic, or lemon juice if a stronger
  flavor is desired. (add more water for thinner consistency.) Place on a
  shallow dish, spread smoothly and sprinkle with paprika and parsley. Serve
  with pita strips, use as a sandwich spread, or stuff into celery.
  
  VARIATIONS: a) Avocado Hoomus: mash in 1 large ripe avocado  b) Eggplant
  Hoomus:  mash in one medium baked eggplant (no skin) and mix with cumin
  added to garbanzo tahini blend.

           -stemmed, and minced                     Salt and pepper to taste
      3 tb Vegetable oil                       2    Eggs, lightly beaten
    3/4 lb Ground beef                    
 
  Servings: 24 patties
  
  Pastry:
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 deg F.  To make the dough: place the flour and salt
  in a large bowl; mix well.  Cut the shortening into small pieces about the
  size of walnuts.  Add to the flour and, using your fingers, rub the flour
  and shortening together, making a coarse, mealy dough.  Add the ice water
  and gather the dough into a ball.  The dough should be firm and not sticky.
  If the dough is too dry, add a little more water, but if the dough is too
  sticky, add just enough flour to make it form a ball. Divide the dough into
  2 equal balls and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours
  or up to 2 days.
  
  To make the filling: in a large skillet, cook the onion, garlic, and
  chilies in the oil over moderate heat for about 10 minutes, stirring from
  time to time.  Add the beef, herbs, spices, bell pepper, and tomatoes, and
  cook over high heat for 5 minutes, stirring constantly until the mixture is
  thick and saucy.  Add the green onions and cook for 1 minute. Season with
  salt and pepper and cool to room temperature.
  
  To assemble the patties:  on a lightly floured surface, divide each ball
  into 2 equal balls, so that you have 4 equal balls.  Flatten into disc
  shapes, then divide each disc into 6 equal pieces and roll each into a
  ball.  Roll each ball into a 3 1/2 inch diameter circle.  Brush the edges
  with beaten egg.  Place about 1 tablespoon of filling on one side of each
  circle, leaving a 1/4 inch border.  Fold the dough over, making a half-moon
  shape.  Seal the edges with the tines of a fork, and brush with the
  remaining egg.
  
  Bake on a lightly greased baking sheet for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the
  patties are golden brown.  Remove from the oven and serve immediately.

           Salt & Pepper                  
 
  Salt & Pepper  |  potatoes, if desired. *-*-*
  
  Scrubb potatoes, dry, then pierce with fork several times.  Arrange on a
  baking sheet and bake in 375 degree oven for about 1 hour or until tender.
  Let stand until cook enough to handle.  Cut potatoes in half lengthwise and
  scoop out centers, leaving 1/8" potato in shell.  Cover. Chill shells up to
  2 days until ready to use for the skins.
  
  If desired, add the 1/3 cup milk, 1/4 cup butter, salt & pepper to use
  potato centers as mashed potatoes.
  
  When ready to prepare skins, melt the 1/3 cup butter.  Brush shells with
  the butter, inside and out.  Place, cut side up, on baking sheet.  Bake in
  a 500 degree oven for 20 minutes or until brown and crisp.
  
  Distribute some bacon, onion, and cheese in each shell.  Bake just until
  cheese melts.  Serve hot.  If the potatoes are large, you may want to cut
  in half crosswise before serving.
  
  You may want to double this recipe if you are serving several people,
  especially if they are hungry!

      2 ts Soy sauce                      
 
  * Dry lily flower and tree ears are available in Oriental markets.
  
  MU SHU PORK:
  
  Rinse dry lily flower and tree ears in cold water.  Soak in cold water to
  cover 1 hour, until soft.  Drain and finely chop.
  
  Heat wok.  When very hot, add peanut oil, turning wok to coat sides. Add
  shredded pork and stir-fry 2 minutes.  Transfer to small bowl.
  
  Add eggs to wok and stir-fry until cooked.  Add to bowl and mix with pork.
  
  Heat more oil if necessary.  Quickly add shredded cabbage, chopped lily
  flower and tree ears, water chestnuts and garlic and stir-fry about 2
  minutes.  Thoroughly blend in pork and eggs.  Season with soy, salt and
  pepper.  Add green onions and cook about 1 minute.  Taste for seasoning.
  
  Place 2 to 3 tablespoons of Mu Shu Pork on each Pao Bin, roll up and serve.
  
  Note:  We always spread some plum sauce on our pancake before putting on
  filling and rolling.  Delicious.
  
  PAO BIN (THIN PANCAKES):
  
  If using food processor, place flour in work bowl.  With motor running, add
  boiling water until dough forms ball.  Transfer to small bowl, cover with
  damp towel and let stand 15 minutes.
  
  If not using food processor, add boiling water gradually to flour, stirring
  with wooden spoon.  When mixture forms mass (it will be lumpy), transfer to
  floured board and knead until dough forms soft, smooth ball. Place in small
  bowl, cover with damp towel and let stand 15 minutes.
  
  Cut dough in half.  Place on lightly floured surface and roll each about
  1/4-inch thick.  Cut into 2- to 2-1/2-inch circles.  Knead scraps together,
  roll out and repeat to cut more circles.
  
  Brush half of the circles with sesame oil.  Place each unoiled circle on 1
  oiled circle.  With rolling pin, roll each pair of circles into larger
  circle about 6 inches in diameter, keeping as round as possible.
  
  Place ungreased 8-inch skillet over high heat to warm.  Reduce heat to
  moderate.  Place 1 pancake in skillet and cook until it puffs and blisters,
  about 30 seconds.  Turn and cook second side.  Flip onto towel and
  carefully separate into 2 pancakes.  Stack on platter or on foil. When all
  are cooked, wrap in foil and place in warm oven until ready to serve.
  
  About 6 servings.

      Title: Mushroom Almond Pate
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 c  Slivered almonds                  3/4 lb Mushrooms, sliced
    1/4 c  Butter                            3/4 ts Salt
      1 sm Onion, chopped                    1/2 ts Thyme
      1    Clove garlic, minced or           1/8 ts Pepper
           -pressed                            2 tb Oil
 
  Mushroom Almond Pate
  
  Spread almonds in a shallow pan and toast in a 350 degree oven for 8
  minutes or until lightly browned
  
  Melt butter in a large frying pan over medium high heat.  Add onion,
  garlic, mushrooms, salt, thyme and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally,
  until onion is soft and most of the pan juices have evaporated.
  
  In a food processor or blender, whirl almonds to form a paste,  With motor
  tunning, add oil and whirl until creamy.
  
  Add mushroom mixture and whirl until pate is smooth.
  
  Chill until set.
  
  I used walnuts, because I had them on hand, and this turned out fine.  I
  served it alongside thinly sliced toasted rounds of italian bread. Yum.
  Next to that, I had a wedge of brie surrounded by bite-sized hunks of
  carrots (cutting veggies to bite size saves the worry some people have
  about others who dip, bite, then stick something bitten back into the dip.
  . .) and a dip I make for veggies that is yummy, but not for the faint of
  heart.
  
  Spicy Yogurt Dip
  
  1 c nonfat yogurt 1 1/2 Tbsp apricot honey (or 1 Tbsp honey plus 1/2 Tbsp
  apricot preserves) 1 tsp curry powder 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
  
  Mix all ingredients together and let sit for at least an hour.  The flavor
  intensifies, but you may want to add curry and/or cayenne later. This
  tastes sweet, and you don't realize it's hot until it's too late.

  This is an easy-to-prepare dish for the quicksilver Gemini that combines
  the foods of Mercury (parsley and mushrooms) with a creamy coating. Because
  of their association with death, mushrooms are an appropriate food for the
  god whose duty was to conduct the souls of the dead to the under- world.
  Rich in minerals and vitamins, parsley helps relieve nervous conditions
  (often a Gemini complaint) and soothes the stomach. Serve this delicious
  starter with a very chilled white wine and thin slices of whole wheat bread
  and butter.

      Title: Onion Tart
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 8 servings
 
-----------------------------------PASTRY-----------------------------------
    200 g  Plain flour                         1    Egg
    130 g  Unsalted butter, softened           1 ds Salt
      3 tb Water                         

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
    400 g  Onions                              4    Eggs
     30 g  Bacon, cut into thin strips         1 ds Gratted nutmeg
     50 g  Unsalted butter                     1 tb Chopped parsley
  3 1/2 dl Cream                                    Salt and pepper
  3 1/2 dl Milk                           
 
  Pastry
  
  Make the flour into a 'well' on the pastry board, beat the egg and add it,
  with the butter, salt and a little of the water, to the centre of the well,
  then work the ingredients into the flour with your fingertips,
  incorporating more water little by little; whether you have to use all the
  water or not depends on the quality of the flour. Press all the dough
  together into a ball then, finally, work it thoroughly with the heel of
  your hand, gathering it up with pastry scraper as you do so until it is
  soft and pliable. Leave it in the refrigerator to firm up again before you
  roll it out.
  
  Filling
  
  Peel the onions. Cut them into fine rings and weigh out 300 g.
  
  Cook the bacon strips (which need to be VERY finely cut) in the butter. Let
  them take on a golden colour, then add the sliced onions and leave them to
  cook gently until they are tender.
  
  In a bowl beat together the cream, milk and eggs, adding salt, pepper and
  nutmeg to taste.
  
  When the onions are cooked, add them to the mixture in the bowl and add the
  chopped parsley.
  
  Preparation
  
  Roll out the dough 2mm thick and use it to line a buttered tart tin 26 cm
  in diameter and at least 3cm deep. Cut a disc of aluminium foil of the same
  diameter as the tin and place it on the pastry. Weight it down with a
  handful of beans or crusts.
  
  Pre-heat the oven to 150 oC (300 oF) and cook the pastry 'blind' for half
  an hour. Watch the coulouring of the edge and as soon as it starts to turn
  golden remove the aluminium foil and beans or crusts. Cook the pastry shell
  until the base is baked but not coloured.
  
  Fill the shell with the onion mixture. Put the tart back into the oven.
  Check that the temperature is still 150 oC and keep the oven at or just
  below this temperature for about 1 hour. Towards the end you could reduce
  the heat a little, as the tart needs TO COOK VERY SLOWLY. The tart is ready
  if, when you shake it, the filling appears to be quite firm with no hint of
  a whole in the centre.
  
  Serve warm, in small slices !

      1 tb Sesame seeds, toasted          
 
  * Chop stems and leave caps whole In a large saucepan, combine 6 cups water
  with the lemon juice, add the mushroom caps, and bring the liquid to a
  boil.  Simmer the mushroom caps for 6 mintues, transfer tham to paper
  towels, and let them drain. (Blanching the mushroom caps will prevent them
  from wrinkling while they are baking.) In a skillet, cook the bacon over
  moderate heat until it is crisp, transfer it to paper towels, and let it
  drain.  Pour off all but 1-1/2 tbsp of the fat from the skillet, in the
  remaining fat cook the onion, the garlic, and the mushroom stems over
  moderately low heat,stirring, until the vegetables are softened, and add
  the soy sauce, the sesame seeds, 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs, the bacon,
  crumbled, and pepper to taste. Cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minutes,
  or until it is slightly dry, divide it among the mushroom caps, mounding
  it, and transfer the stuffed mushrooms to a jelly-roll pan. The mushrooms
  may be prepared up to this point 1 day in advance and kept covered tightly
  with plastic wrap and chilled.  Sprinkle the remaining 1 tbsp bread crumbs
  over the mushrooms and bake the mushrooms in the middle of a preheated 325
  F oven for 7 minutes, or until the filling is heated through. To make the
  filling crisper, the cooked mushrooms may be put under a preheated broiler
  about 4 inches from the heat for 1 minute. Garnish the mushrooms with the
  scallion.  Makes 24 stuffed mushrooms.

      Title: Oysters in Champagne Sauce
 Categories: Appetizers, Sauces
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     24    Raw oysters - in shell        

------------------------------CHAMPAGNE SAUCE------------------------------
  1 1/2 tb Unsalted butter                   1/4 ts Celery seed - ground
  1 1/2 tb Flour                                    Freshly ground white pepper
    1/2 c  Oyster juice - from above           2 c  Rock salt - or coarse salt
    1/2 c  Champagne - or other dry                 -for the broiler pan
           -sparkling wine                
 
  * 2 cups rock salt - or coarse salt for the broiler pan
  
  *DIRECTIONS*
  
  PREPARATION: Open the oysters as instructed in previous recipe ("Opening
  Oysters in the Microwave").  Measure 1/2 cup of the strained cooking liquid
  and reserve.
  
  CHAMPAGNE SAUCE: Melt the butter in a 1-quart glass or ceramic measure or
  bowl, uncovered, on high for 2 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup reserved oyster
  juices and Champagne and cook, uncovered, on high, stirring twice during
  cooking, for 4 minutes or until thickened. Recipe can be made to this point
  a few hours ahead.
  
  COOKING AND SERVING: Heat the broiler with rack set at its highest level.
  Stir celery seed and white pepper to taste into the sauce. Spread 2 cups of
  coarse or rock salt in the bottom of a broiler pan to steady oysters.
  Nestle reserved shells into salt.  Put each oyster in a shell and
  thoroughly coat the tops with sauce.  Put under preheated broiler until
  just golden, about 2 minutes.
  
  Makes 4 first-course servings.
  
  NOTE:  This is a simple and elegant classic.  You can prepare the oysters
  and sauce ahead in the microwave, and then broil for a minute or two just
  before serving.  The obvious wine to serve is Champagne. If you choose
  another dry sparkling wine to drink instead, use the same one in the sauce.

  3.   Pick over spinach and remove any tough stems and blemished leaves.
  Rince  well  and put in a saucepan.  Cover  and  cook, stirring, until
  spinach is wilted. Cook briefly and drain well. Squeeze to remove excess
  moisture.  Blend or put through a food mill. There should be about 2 cups.
  
  4. Put the scallions, celery, and parsley into the container of an electric
  blender and blend.  There should be about  1  cup finely blended.
  
  5.  Chop the anchovies and garlic together finely.
  
  6.   Heat  4  tablespoons of butter in a skillet  and  add  the scallion
  and celery mixture.  Stir about 1 minute and add  the anchovie mixture.
  Cook,  stirring, about 1 minute, and add the spinach. Stir to blend.
  
  7.   Heat  remaining 4 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan  and add the
  flour.  Blend,  stirring with a wire whisk,  and  add oyster liquor,
  stirring vigorously with the whisk. Stir in the cream. Season with Tobasco
  to taste.  DO NOT ADD SALT. Add the spinach mixture and Pernod. Let cool.

  over the tops.  Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.  Bake about 25 minutes or
  until piping hot.
  
  Note:  The same spinach topping is equally as good, (some think better),
  with clams on the half-shell. (Clams Rockefeller)

  General Instructions for Panzerotti
  
  1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees for 30 minutes.
  
  2. Roll the dough of your choice out to an even 1/8 inch thickness with a
  rolling pin.  If necessary, use dustings of flour to prevent the dough from
  sticking.
  
  3. Cut out as many panzerotti as possible using a 3 inch glass as a cutter.
  
  4. Combine all of the ingredients together in a bowl for any of the 6
  filling suggestions.
  
  5. Put a scant teaspoon of filling on one half of each of the circles of
  dough. (There will be leftover filling if using Roman Pepper Pastry Dough;
  use it in an omelet.)
  
  6. Fold the dough over into little crescent shapes, pressing down to seal
  the edges with your fingers.  Place each one on an oiled baking sheet.
  
  7. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until lightly colored.  Or deep-fry in 2
  inches of vegetable oil until golden.  Panzerotti are best served piping
  hot.
  
  Freezing Panzerotti
  
  Freeze the raw panzerotti in one layer on a baking sheet.  Once they are
  frozen solid, they can be transferred to plastic bags.  The can be frozen
  up to 4 months.
  
  Reheating Panzerotti
  
  To reheat Panzerotti,simply put them on a baking sheet and warm them up in
  a 350 degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes.
  
  To bake frozen panzerotti, preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Lay the
  panzerotti on a baking sheet and cover them tightly with aluminum foil.
  Bake for 15 minutes.  Then remove the foil and continue baking until
  turnovers are golden brown.

 Categories: Appetizers, Fish/sea, Sausages
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Fish Fillets                        1 tb Fresh Lemon Juice
           Such As Sole, Flounder,             2 ts Ground Cumin
           Salmon Or Whitefish                 2 ts Salt
           All One Kind Or Mixed             1/4 ts Ground Black Pepper
    1/2 lb Shrimp And/Or Scallops,             5    Feet Hog Casing
           Raw, Cleaned                             In A Continuous Length,
    1/2 c  Packed Cilantro Leaves                   Soaked In Cold Water For
      4 lg Egg Whites                               A Few Minutes *
 
  *Note: If hog casing is unavailable, seven 5- by 10-inch pieces of kitchen
  parchment may be used instead.  See end of recipe for related info.
  ~-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Cut the fish into long strips; the shrimp and scallops can remain whole.
  Put the seafood, jalapenos and cilantro through a coarse blade of a meat
  grinder.  Combine the ground seafood with the egg whites, lemon juice,
  cumin, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Rinse the hog casing in cold water
  by letting the water run from the tap directly through it.  (The casing
  should not have any holes.)  Gather the casing up onto the sauce stuffing
  funnel attachment on your meat grinder. Put the seafood mixture back in the
  grinder and begin to grind it through. When it begins to emerge from the
  funnel, tie the end of the casing in a knot, leaving 3 inches of it
  unfilled for expansion room.  Grind the mixture out, taking care not to
  overstuff the length of sausage; it should be about 1 inch wide.  If
  necessary, squeeze it gently with your hands to make this width as you
  work.  Continue with the entire length; you will have about 4 feet of
  sausage. Remove the funnel and use your finger to press out the last
  remaining seafood mixture.  Leave 3 inches for expansion and tie the end in
  a knot. Shape to make it even.  Coil it into a spiral and set it aside.
  Bring 1 inch of water to a boil in a large heavy skillet with a lid. Reduce
  the heat so that the water barely quivers.  Prick the sausage with a sharp
  knife pint at 3-inch intervals.  Place it in the barely moving water, cover
  the pan and cook for 10 minutes.  Turn off the heat and let the sausage
  rest for 10 minutes before serving. NOTE: If you use kitchen parchment,
  butter the paper and place 1/2 cup of the mixture on each piece. Roll it
  up, twist the ends and tie them securely with string. Poach as directed.

      Title: Phyllo, Eating Well's Low-Fat Method
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 1 servings
 
 
  For appetizers with a lot of style but little fat, phyllo pastries are a
  natural. The paper-thin sheets of phyllo dough can be rolled, folded,
  shaped, seasoned, or filled in countless ways. In typical phyllo recipes,
  however, the layers of dough are freely brushed with melted butter; when
  baked, the butter keeps the thin sheets separate, producing a flaky--and
  fat-saturated--result. We developed a technique in which the leaves of
  phyllo are lightly coated with a blend of egg white and olive oil. During
  baking, the egg whites become crisp while the oil keeps the leaves
  separate. The low-fat technique has an unexpected and welcome benefit: the
  pastries turn out crisper and less oily than those made with pure fat, and
  filled pastires don't become soggy.
  
  Frozen phyllo (or filo or fillo) is available in most supermarkets; it is
  also sold fresh in some Greek and Middle Eastern specialty shops. One pound
  of dough averages 25 large sheets of pastry. Our recipes were devloped for
  full-sized sheets, either 14 by 18 inches or 12 by 17 inches. These
  appetizers work beautifully for entertaining because they can be prepared
  in advance and refrigerated or frozen.
  
  TIPS:
  
  Phyllo Dough is easy and fun to work with as long as it doesn't get soggy
  or dried out. To avoid these potential hazards:
  
     Thaw frozen phyllo in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours or
  overnight; this will prevent damp spots that could cause the sheets of
  dough to stick together.
  
     Remove phyllo from refrigerator, and leave unopened at room temperature
  for 1 to 2 hours.
  
     Clear a large work surface before removing phyllo from the box.
  
     Carefully unroll sheets onto a dry surface.
  
     Keep sheets of phyllo covered with plastic wrap or wax paper while you
  work; if the dough is left uncovered for even a short period of time, it
  dries out and breaks into flakes.
  
     Work quickly and with a gentle hand.

      1 lg Egg white                         1/4 c  Parmesan cheese; freshly
      3 tb Olive oil                                --grated
      6    Phyllo dough sheets (14x18")        1 lb Plum tomatoes (about 8)
      5 ts Breadcrumbs; dry                    2 tb Parsley; fresh (chopped)
    1/3 c  Dijon mustard                       1 ts Thyme; fresh, or 1/2 t drie
 
       Set oven rack on the upper level; preheat to 400 degrees F. Lightly
  coat a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray or line with parchment
  paper In a small bowl, whisk together the egg white and 2 Tbsp. olive oil.
       Lay a sheet of phyllo on the prepared baking sheet, and with a pastry
  brush, lightly coat the surface with the egg-white mixture.  Sprinkle with
  1 tsp. breadcrumbs. Repeat this step, layering 4 more sheets of phyllo on
  top and brush with egg-white mixture. To form an edge to the tart,
  carefully roll over the edges toward the center, using the blade of a knife
  to help you get started.
       With a rubber spatula, spread mustard over the surface of the dough
  and sprinkle with cheese. (The tart can be prepared ahead to this point.
  Wrap and freeze for up to 2 months. Do not thaw before continuing.) Arrange
  tomato slices on top in 5 rows of 8 slices each. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes,
  or until the pastry is golden brown. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes. In
  a small bowl, combine the remaining 1 Tbsp. olive oil, parsley, garlic and
  thyme. With your fingers or a fork, dab some of the herb mixture onto each
  tomato slice. Slide the tart onto a serving platter or, if you wish to
  serve bite-sized appetizers, slide it onto a cutting board and with a sharp
  knife or pizza cutter, cut the tart into squares between the tomato slices.
  Serve warm or at room temperature.

      2 tb Sesame seeds                      1/4 ts Salt
      1 lg Egg white                           6    Phyllo dough sheets (14x18"
 
       Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly coat 2 baking sheets with
  nonstick cooking spray or line with parchment paper. Heat a small heavy
  skillet over medium heat. Add the poppy and sesame seeds and cook, stirring
  until they are aromatic and toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn out onto a plate
  to cool. In a small bowl, whisk together egg white, oil and salt.
       Lay a sheet of phyllo on a work surface with a short side toward you.
  With a pastry brush, lightly coat the lower half of the sheet with the
  egg-white mixture and sprinkle with 1 tsp. seeds. Fold the upper half over
  to cover the lower half. Brush the right half of the folded sheet with
  egg-white mixture, sprinkle with 1/4 tsp. seeds and fold the left half over
  the seeds. Brush the bottom half of the folded sheet with the egg-white
  mixture, sprinkle with 1/4 tsp. seeds and fold the upper half over.
  Finally, brush the top with the egg-white mixture and sprinkle with 1/4
  tsp. seeds. Cut into 10 short strips using a knife or serrated pastry
  cutter. With a wide spatula, transfer the strips to the baking sheet,
  placing them about 1/2 inch apart. Repeat the procedure with the remaining
  5 sheets of phyllo, egg-white mixture and seeds. Bake the straws for 8 to
  10 minutes, until golden and crisp. Transfer to a rack to cool.
       The straws may be stored in an airtight container at room temperature
  for 1 week or in the freezer for up to 2 months.
       Makes about 5 dozen straws.

      2 c  All purpose flour                        -cheese
      1 c  Semolina flour                      6    Single amaretto
    1/2 ts Salt                                2    Egg
      4    Room temperature egg              1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Olive oil                         1/4 ts Freshly ground white pepper
      2 tb Warm water                        1/4 ts Fresh grated nutmeg
     10 oz Solid pack pumpkin                  2 tb Olive oil
    1/2 c  Freshly grated Parmesan           3/4 c  Clarified unsalted butter
 
  For pasta: Combine flours and 1/2 teaspoon salt in processor. Add 4 eggs, 2
  tablespoons olive oil and water and blend until dough comes together, about
  20 seconds. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and knead until
  smooth, about 3 minutes. Wrap in plastic. Let stand 15 minutes.
  
  For filling: Blend next 7 ingredients in processor. Set mixture aside.
  
  To assemble: Cut dough into 6 pieces. Flatten 1 piece of dough (keep
  remainder covered to prevent drying), then fold into thirds. Turn pasta
  machine to widest setting and run dough through. Repeat until dough is
  smooth and velvety, folding before each run and dusting with flour if
  sticky. Adjust pasta machine to next narrower setting. Run dough through
  without folding. Repeat, narrowing rollers after each run until pasta is
  about 1/16 inch thick, dusting with flour if sticky. Repeat with another
  piece of dough. Lay 1 dough sheet on lightly floured surface. Mound level
  teaspoons of filling at 2-inch intervals, leaving 1/2-inch border along
  edges. Brush dough between filling and along edges with water. Top with
  second sheet, pressing around filling to seal. Trim around filling using
  pastry cutter to create ravioli. Arrange ravioli on lightly floured waxed
  paper. Repeat with remaining dough. Let ravioli dry until leathery around
  edges. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead and refrigerated.)
  
  Stir 2 tablespoons olive oil into large pot of boiling salted water. Add
  ravioli (in batches if necessary) and cook until just tender but firm to
  bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well. Transfer to bowl. Add butter and toss
  well. Divide among 8 plates. Sprinkle each with freshly grated Parmesan
  cheese if desired. Top with freshly ground pepper.

      Title: Samoosas - the Pastry
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 48 servings
 
--------------------------------PUR (PASTRY--------------------------------
    750 ml Cake flour                        250 ml Cold water
      1 pn Borrie (turmeric)                   5 ml White vinegar
  2 1/2 ml Salt                               75 ml Cooking oil for spreading
 
  Preheat oven to 200 'C. Sift flour,borrie and salt into a mixing bowl.
  Combine water and vinegar and mix with flour to a fairly stiff mixture,The
  consistency of bread dough. Divide into 12 balls. Working with four balls
  of dough at a time, roll each into a round the size of a large saucer (15
  cm in diameter). Using your fingers, spread a little oil on each
  round,covering it well so that it does not stick during cooking. Sprinkle
  lightly with flour and place one round on top of the other, oily sides
  together. You will now have two rounds, each made up of a double layer of
  dough. oil and flour the tops in the same way as before. Sandwich these
  together to form a single pile of four rounds. Each layer of which has been
  oiled and dusted with flour. Repeat with remaining balls of dough.
  
  Gently roll out piles of rounds on a lightly floured board to a 25 cm
  diameter circle or oval. Turn the pastry from time to time. Place the
  rolled out pastry on an ungreased baking sheet and bake for 2-3 minutes or
  until the pastry has puffed up slightly. Remove from oven and cut into
  strips 6 cm wide and 25-30 cm long. Then separate into thin layers before
  the pastry cools down. Cover with a damp cloth to prevent the pastry from
  drying out.
  
  Now hopefully I don't confuse you on this next part! My diagram is supposed
  to represent the strip of pastry 6 cm wide 25-30 cm long. Fold #1 corner
  over # 2, Then fold the # 2 triangle over # 3 this will have created a
  pocket where the filling goes into.

      /    \    /    \    /    \ _/________\/________\/___2____\_
  
  Fill the pocket with one of the samoosas filling recipes. You then continue
  folding the triangles to seal off the opening. Seal off the small remaining
  edge with a paste of flour and water, Then lightly pinch two bottom edges
  together to puff it up before you fry it.
  
  Once the filling and folding has taken place, You deep-fry the samoosas in
  hot oil over medium heat, turning once or twice to ensure that they are
  evenly cooked. When golden brown, remove with a slotted spoon and drain on
  paper towel.
  
  Makes 48 samoosas.

      1    Minced small onion                 16    12 inch sheets phyllo
      1    Minced garlic clove                      -stacked between 2 sheets of
      1 tb Unsalted butter                          -wax
    1/2 lb Mushroom chopped fine                    Paper and covered with damp
    1/2 ts Ground cumin                             -dish towel
      1 pn Of allspice                       1/4 c  Clarified butter
    1/2 ts Dried crumbled mint                 2 tb Fine fresh bread crumbs
    1/4 c  Minced fresh parsley leaves    
 
  In a large skillet cook the sausage meat over moderately high heat,
  stirring and breaking up any larger pieces, until it is cooked through and
  browned.
  
  Transfer meat to a fine sieve, and drain. In the skillet, cook the onion
  and the garlic in the unsalted butter over moderately low heat until the
  onion is softened. Add the mushrooms, and cook the mixture over moderate
  heat, stirring until the liquid  the mushrooms give off evaporates. Add the
  cumin, allspice and the mint and cook the mixture, stirring, for 2 minutes.
  
  Transfer the mixture to a bowl, add the sausage meat, the parsley, cream
  cheese, and salt and pepper to taste, and combine the mixture well. Working
  quickly to keep the phyllo from drying out, put 1 sheet of phyllo on a work
  surface, brush lightly with some of the clarified butter, and sprinkle with
  1 tablespoon of the bread crumbs. Lay another sheet of phyllo on top of the
  first sheet and brush lightly with some of the remaining clarified butter.
  
  Cut the sheets into thirds lengthwise and into quarters crosswise to form
  12 squares. Put a rounded teaspoon of the filling in each square, gather
  the corners of the phyllo over the filling, and twist the phyllo gently to
  seal it. Continue to make hors d'oeuvres in the same manner with the
  remaining phyllo, butter, crumbs and filling. Bake the sausage and mushroom
  phyllo twists in jelly-roll pans in a preheated oven at 400 degrees for
  10-12 minutes,or until phyllo is golden brown.

 Categories: Appetizers, Fish/sea, Cakes, Pancakes, Breakfast
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      1 c  Flour                             1/2 lb Shrimp, shelled

      4 ts Oil                               1/4 c  Light cream
  1 1/2 c  Milk plus 1 Tbsp                    1 c  Gruyere Cheese
    1/2 lb Monkfish                            2 tb Parsley, fresh, chopped
      6    Scallops                            1    Salt and pepper
    3/4 c  Milk                            1 1/2 tb Oil for frying
      2    Garlic cloves, chopped         
 
  Servings: 10
  
  Make pancake batter by mixing flour and salt in mixing bowl.  Make well in
  center and pour in the egg, 4 tsp oil and 1 cup milk.  Whisk to smooth
  batter then add remaining milk.
  
  Remove any skin from monkfish, rinse and cut into bite-size pieces.  Pat
  dry. Rinse and pat dry scallops, cut in half.  Pour 3/4 cup milk into
  saucepan, add garlic and bring to simmer.  Add all fish except shrimp.
  Simmer for 5-6 minutes then add shrimp. When shrimp turn pink remove all
  fish to a bowl and set aside. Strain fish milk and reserve for sauce. Place
  butter in saucepan and melt, add flour and stir for 2 minutes, then pour in
  reserved milk and the cream. Continue to stir and simmer for a few minutes
  until you have a smooth sauce. Turn heat to low, add cheese and parsley and
  season to taste with salt and pepper. Add fish, mix well.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Place small frying pan or omelet pan over high heat.  Lightly grease it
  with a little oil. Beat pancake batter, then pour 3 Tbsp into pan. Turn pan
  so bottom is covered evenly with batter and cook for 40-60 seconds, turn
  and cook 30-40 seconds longer. Transfer to large plate. Continue with
  remaining batter. (There should be enough filling for 10 pancakes.) Place
  an equal amount of filling (about 3 Tbsp) in center of each pancake, fold
  the sides over filling and arrange in ovenproof dish just large enough to
  hold pancakes. Place in oven for 20 minutes, or until the pancakes are hot
  through.  Serve immediately.
  
  These thin pancakes, which conceal a tasty mixture of fish, will appeal to
  the masked and mysterious side of the Cancerian, who when in need of
  refreshment and quiet will reture into his or her own protective shell.
  These can be served as a first course or as a luncheon dish for four, with
  a green salad and a very chilled white wine.

 Categories: Fish/sea, Appetizers, Sausages
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 lb Whitefish, skinned, boned         1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 lb Salmon, skinned and boned         1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/4 lb Shrimps, peeled                   1/2 c  Egg whites
      2 tb Finely minced onion                 4    Feet sausage casings
      1 bn Parsley; stems removed         
 
  CUT THE FISH IN 1-INCH PIECES. Place all ingredients except casings in a
  food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped. Or, pass all the
  ingredients through a meat grinder fitted with medium holes. Stuff the
  mixture into sausage casings or form 2 long sausages in plastic wrap. Poach
  the sausages in gently simmering water for 5 minutes, drain and let cool.
  If you have used plastic wrap to form the sausages, remove it when sausages
  are cool. Cut sausages into 6-inch lengths. To serve, grill the sausages or
  place under a preheated broiler. Since the sausages are already cooked, we
  want only to reheat them and crisp their skins.
  
  Makes 8 Sausages, or 4 Servings

      Title: Shrimp Ono Nui
 Categories: Appetizers, Fish/sea
      Yield: 8 servings
 
     24    Raw jumbo shrimp; peeled        1 1/2 c  Shredded coconut
    1/2 c  Flour                                    Oil; for deep frying
           Salt                                1 c  Bottled cocktail sauce
      2    Eggs; beaten                      1/4 c  Crushed pineapple
 
  This Hawaiian-style shrimp dish came from the Safari Steakhouse restaurant
  in the Sheraton Waikiki Hotel in Honolulu.  The shrimp are heavily coated
  with shredded coconut before being deep-fried and served with a pineapple
  cocktail sauce.  Ono nui means "very good" in Hawaiian and this dish
  definitely lives up to its name.
  
  Roll the shrimp in flour seasoned with salt, then dip in the beaten egg.
  Roll the shrimp in the coconut, covering thoroughly.  Deep-fry the shrimp
  in oil heated to about 350 degrees until browned and cooked through, about
  3 to 4 minutes.  Drain on paper towels.  Mix the cocktail sauce with the
  crushed pineapple.  Serve the shrimp with the sauce on the side.

      Title: Shrimp Paste
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Shrimp, cooked and peeled         1/8 ts Celery salt
    1/2 lb Butter                            1/8 ts Cayenne Pepper
    1/2 ts Salt                              1/2 ts Nutmeg
 
  Toast crumbs
  
  Grind the shrimp very fine.  Cream the butter until soft and add the ground
  shrimp, mixing well.  Then add the seasonings and combine thoroughly. Place
  in an oblong baking dish and sprinkle toast crumbs over the top of the
  shrimp mixture.  Brown in a hot oven (400) for about three minutes. Cool
  and place in the refrigerator until time to serve (for several hours at
  least.)
  
  This paste is not as firm as the preceding one, and it has a much more
  buttery flavor.  The nutmeg is quite noticeable, although it blends well
  with the shrimp. --Mrs. Walter Pringle

  Servings: 4 as main course, or 8 as an appetizer Notes: This is a version
  of the shrimp rolls we ate in the Delta. You can omit the rice papers and
  simply wrap the filling in lettuce leaves. The rolls can be assembled ahead
  of time and served as an appetizer. Or the wrappers can be placed on the
  table (with bowls of warm water for softening) with a platter of fillings,
  so that guests can make a meal of them. One half fresh pineapple, peeled,
  eyes removed, halved, cored and thinly sliced, 2 tomatoes, thinly sliced,
  1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves, coarsely chopped, 1/2 cup fresh mint leaves,
  coarsely chopped Nuoc Cham dipping sauce, with carrot shreds DIRECTIONS:
  Cook shrimp in salted, boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes, or until pink and
  firm to the touch. Drain and cool. Peel and devein shrimp, or serve them in
  their shells and let diners peel them at the table. Blanch bean sprouts in
  boiling water for 1 minute. Drain and refresh with cold water.
  
  To assemble: Moisten rice papers in warm water for 10 to 20 seconds, or
  until softened. Place a lettuce leaf inside each piece of softened rice
  paper. Fill with a few shrimp, a little pineapple, bean sprouts, tomato,
  cilantro and/or mint. Roll up the bundles and serve with Nuoc Cham.

      Title: Smoked Stuffed Artichoke
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Artichokes, fresh ones            1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
           -have tight leaves                  3 tb White wine
      2    Green onions, finely                3 tb Lemon juice
           -chopped                                 Salt and pepper
      6 tb Olive oil                         1/2 ts Garlic powder
      1 c  Mushrooms, finely chopped         1/2 c  Ham, cooked, finely chopped
    1/2 c  Bread crumbs                        1 tb Parsley, chopped
 
      Trim tops and leaves of artichokes with scissors and cut stalks level
  with base.  (I would cut off the top third of the artichoke and cut off the
  tips of the leaves remaining to remove "spikes".) Put artichokes into a
  kettle of boiling salted water and simmer about 35 to 40 minutes or until a
  leaf can be pulled out easily. Drain, refresh under cold running water, and
  let stand upside down until cool.
      To make the dressing:  Saute green onions slowly in 2 tablespoons of
  the oil, until just tender.  Stir in mushrooms and cook 2-3 minutes; then
  stir in bread crumbs and cheese.  Transfer mixture to a bowl and let stand
  until cool.  Stir in wine, lemon juice and remaining oil. Season well with
  garlic salt, salt and pepper, then add ham.
      Prepare each artichoke by pulling out some of the center leaves until
  the choke can be reached.  (I'd just cut off about the top third of the
  artichoke and the choke would be reachable.)  With a teaspoon, scrape out
  all the hairy choke.  Fill each artichoke with dressing and top with
  parsley.  Wrap each artichoke in foil, leaving the top open. Place on
  smoker grid and smoke for 1 to 1-1/2 hours.

      Title: Smoked Trout Tartlets
 Categories: Appetizers, Fish/sea
      Yield: 48 servings
 
-----------------------------PHYLLO TART SHELLS-----------------------------
      1 lg Egg white                         1/4 ts Salt
      2 tb Olive oil                           8    Phyllo dough sheets (14x18"

----------------------------SMOKED TROUT FILLING----------------------------
      2 pk Cream cheese, low-fat (8 oz)      1/3 c  Scallions; chopped (2 scall
    1/2 lb Trout fillets; smoked, skin         4 ts Horseradish; well drained
           --and pin bones removed             1 c  Cucumber; shredded
 
      To make phyllo tartlet shells: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly
  coat 2 mini-muffin pans with nonstick cooking spray. In a small bowl, whisk
  together egg white, oil and salt.
      Lay a sheet of phyllo on a work surface and with a pastry brush,
  lightly coat it with the egg-white mixture. Lay a second sheet smoothly on
  top, taking care to line up the edges before setting the sheet down. (Once
  you set down the sheet, it cannot be moved.) Brush with the egg-white
  mixture and repeat with 1 more sheet. Lay a fourth sheet on top but do not
  brush it.
      With a knife, cut the dough into 4 strips lenghtwise and 5 strips
  crosswise, making 24 squares. Press squares into muffin cups and bake for 8
  to 12 minutes, or until golden brown and crisp. Transfer the tartlets to a
  rack and let cool. Repeat the procedure with the remaining 4 sheets of
  phyllo and egg-white mixture. (The baked tartlet shells may be stored in a
  closed container at room temperature for 1 week or in the freezer for up to
  2 months.)
  
       To make smoked trout filling: In a food processor, combine cream
  cheese and smoked trout; process until fairly smooth. Add scallions and
  horseradish and pulse until just combined. (Alternatively, finely mince the
  smoked trout with a knife and combine with the cream cheese, scallion and
  horseradish in a small bowl.) (The smoked filling may be made ahead and
  refrigerated for up to 2 days.) Shortly before serving, spoon or pipe about
  1 heaping tsp. of filling into each tartlet shell and garnish with shredded
  cucumber.

  From: Bill Birner
  
  Any number of smoked fish can be used in this simple recipe. Instead of a
  large serving bowl, you can also chill it in small individual bowls or
  ramekins for an elegant first course, with thinly sliced French or black
  bread.
  
  Flake the tuna or mackerel and combine it with the cream cheese, mayonnaise
  and lemon juice in a food processor. Process until smooth and season to
  taste with salt and pepper. Transfer the mixture to a serving bowl and fold
  in the red onion. Cover and chill the pate until ready to serve.

      Title: Souffleed Crepes
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 28 servings
 
      3    Eggs; separated                   1/2 ts Sugar
      1 c  Milk                              1/4 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Flour                               2 tb Butter; melted, cooled
 
  These proportions make an eggier-tasting crepe.  Beat the egg yolks with
  part of the milk, add flour, sugar, salt, beat well.  Add remaining milk
  gradually, then melted butter.  Beat egg whites stiff.  Fold into crepe
  mixture.  They either may be cooked in the usual way in a crepe pan or put
  into a large buttered pan and baked in a preheated 375F oven for about 25
  to 30 minutes.  This then becomes something like a flat souffle that can be
  topped with a filling or one can be put over half the batter, the rest
  poured on top.  It can be a sweet filling like strawberries or apples and
  may be flavored with lemon rind, brandy, or vanilla.

      Title: Sour Cream Brittlebread
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  1 1/3 c  Flour                             1/4 c  Butter
      2 tb Sugar                             1/2 c  Sour cream or soured milk**
    1/4 ts Salt (optional, see note*)          1 tb Seasoned salt (optional)
    1/4 ts Baking soda                              Kosher salt for sprinkling
 
  * Leave out the first salt if using seasoned salt ** (My note) works OK
  with 1/2 tb lemon juice in milk thickened with extra milk powder to make
  1/2 cup. Sprinkled salt did not stick very well, suggest mixing in the
  desired amount of regular salt. Spices may mix more evenly if combined
  first with the flour.
  
  Preheat oven to 400 F.  Sift together the flour, sugar, salt and baking
  soda into a bowl or food processor.  Cut in the butter.  Add the sour ceam
  and salt or seasoning.  Mix to a soft dough.
  
  Roll out PAPER-THIN on a floured board.  Cut in 1 1/2" squares or shapes
  and sprinkle with salt (see note).  Bake on ungreased baking sheet about 5
  min.  Remove the thin pieces that brown first if necessary and give the
  other pieces a bit longer to brown. Turn off heat and crisp in the oven.
  Makes about 3 small cookie sheets of "crackers" almost touching or may be
  cooked in larger sheets to break up after cooking.  May be rolled between
  sheets of wax paper 1/4 to 1/2 of the dough at a time.
  
  Keep for snacking in an air tight jar. Suggestion - divide the dough and
  the spices in thirds.  Mix and bake the first pan and taste so that
  seasoning or salt can be adjusted.  OR make some spicy and some just salted
  and cut them different shapes so you know which are which.

      1 lg Egg white                           8    Phyllo dough sheets (14x18"
      2 tb Olive oil                           1 ts Poppy or sesame seeds or a
    1/4 ts Salt                                     --combination
 
       To make lamb filling: In a small bowl, cover raisins with boiling
  water and let steep for 5 minutes; drain and set aside.
       Set a large nonstick skillet over low heat and add the pine nuts.
  Cook, stirring, until well toasted, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn out onto a plat to
  cool. Chop pine nuts and reserve. Add oil to the skillet and heat over
  medium heat. Add onions and garlic; saute until softened and beginning to
  color, 3 to 5 minutes. Add lamb, cumin, cinnamon and all-spice; cook,
  stirring, until the lamb is no longer pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a
  colander and drain off fat. Return the lamb mixture to the skillet and add
  chicken stock, reserved raisins and pine nuts, parsley and lemon juice;
  cook until liquid is absorbed, about 1 minute. Season with sal and pepper.
  Let cool. (The lamb filling can be prepared ahead and refrigerated for up
  to 2 days.)
  
       To form phyllo triangles: Set oven rack on the upper level; preheat to
  350 degrees F. Lightly coat a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray ro
  line with parchment paper. In a small bowl, whist together egg white, oil,
  and salt.
       Lay a sheet of phyllo on the work surface with short side toward you.
  Cut lenghtwise into thirds. Brush the lenghtwise half of each strip lightly
  with the egg-white mixture. Place a tablespoon of filling at the bottom of
  the strip and fold one corner of the strip over the filling diagonally
  across to the opposite edge to form a triangle. Continue to fold the
  triangle onto itself, as you would fold a flag. Place on the prepeared
  baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining phyllo, egg-white mixture and
  filling.
       Brush the triangles lightly with the egg-white mixture and sprindle
  with seeds, if desired. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until dar, golden.
  Let cool for 5 minutes before serving hot. (The triangles may be baked up
  to 2 days in advance, then reheated in a 350 degree F oven for 10 to 12
  minutes, or until heated through.)

      Title: Spinach-Feta Rolls
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 36 servings
 
----------------------------SPINACH-FETA FILLING----------------------------
  1 1/4 lb Spinach; fresh, stemmed and         2 tb Parmesan cheese, freshly
           --washed                                 --grated
      1 tb Olive oil                           2 tb Dill; fresh, chopped
      3 bn Scallions, trimmed and              1 tb Lemon juice
           --chopped (1-1/2 c)                      Salt & pepper, to taste
    1/4 c  Feta cheese; crumbled               2 lg Egg whites

-------------------------------PHYLLO PASTRY-------------------------------
      8    Phyllo dough sheets (14x18")      1/4 ts Salt
      1 lg Egg white                           1 ts Poppy or sesame seeds, or a
      2 tb Olive oil                                --combination
 
     To make filling: Put spinach with water still clinging to the leaves in
  a large pot. Cover and cook over medium heat until the spinach is wilted,
  about 5 minutes. Drain and refresh with cold water. Squeeze the spinach
  quite dry and chop. In nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add
  scallions and saute until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a
  medium-sized bowl and stir in spinach, feta, Parmesan, dill and lemon
  juice. Season with salt and pepper. Beat egg whites lightly with a fork and
  stir into the spinach mixture.
  
      To form phyllo rolls: Set oven rack on the upper level; preheat to 350
  degrees F. Coat a baking sheet lightly with nonstick cooking spray or line
  with parchment paper. In a small bowl, whisk together egg white, oil and
  salt. Lay one sheet of phyllo on a work surface with a short side toward
  you. Brush lower half of the sheet with the egg-white mixture. Repeat this
  step with a second sheet of phyllo and set on top of the first. Spoon
  one-quarter of the spinach filling along one long edge. Tuck in the side
  edges and roll up, jelly-roll fashion. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
  Repeat with the remaining phyllo, egg-white mixture and filling, making 4
  rolls in all. Brush tops of the rolls lightly with the egg-mixture and
  sprinkle with seeds, if desired. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes. With a serrated
  knife, cut each roll diagonally into 9 pieces and serve hot.
  
  The rolls may be prepared, baked and sliced up to 2 days in advance. Reheat
  in a 350 degree F oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until heated through. Makes
  36 appetizers.

      Title: Stuffed Zucchini Boats
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Zucchini, 1/2 lb. each                   - to taste
    1/2 lb Mushrooms                           1 c  Bread crumbs, fresh, fine
      4 tb Butter                              2 tb Bread crumbs, fresh, fine
      1 c  Onion, finely chopped             1/3 c  Parsley, finely chopped
      2 ts Garlic, finely minced               4 tb Parmesan, fresh grated
      2 ts Lemon juice                         1    Egg yolk
    1/4 ts Thyme (the dried type)              3 tb Olive oil (extra virgin is
           Salt & freshly ground pepper             - best)
 
      Preheat oven to 450F.  Trim off the ends of each zucchini.  Cut each in
  half crosswise.  Cut each piece in half lengthwise.  Scoop out the centers,
  leaving a shell at least 1/4-inch thick.  Reserve and finely chop the
  scooped-out portions.  There should be about 1-1/2 cups. Pour enough water
  to cover the shells into a saucepan and boil.
   Add the shells and simmer 2 minutes.  Drain thoroughly.  Clean and finely
  chop mushrooms.  There should be about 2 cups.  Heat butter in heavy
  skillet and add onions and garlic.  Cook briefly, stirring, and add
  mushrooms and lemon juice.  Stir and cook one minute.  Add the chopped
  zucchini, thyme, salt and pepper.  Cook about 3 minutes until the excess
  moisture evaporates.
      Spoon and scrape the mixture into a mixing bowl and let cool slightly.
  Add 1 cup of the bread crumbs, the parsley, 2 tablespoons of the cheese and
  blend thoroughly.  Stir in the egg yolk.
      With 1 tablespoon of the oil, brush the inside of a baking dish big
  enough to hold the shells in one layer.  Spoon an equal portion of the
  filling into each shell and smooth over the top.  Blend the remaining 2
  tablespoons bread crumbs with the remaining 2 tablespoons cheese and
  sprinkle over the top of the stuffed zucchini boats. Sprinkle evenly with
  the remaining 2 tablespoons oil.
      Place the dish in the oven and bake 25 minutes.  Serve immediately.
  NOTE FROM ME:  I cut the finished zucchini in half to serve more people
  before "saucing". Recipe from Pierre Franey's column, "The 60 Minute

      Title: Sun Dried Tomato Dip
 Categories: Dips, Microwave
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 lb Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Dry         1 1/2 ts Oregano, Dried
           (Not In Oil)                    1 1/2 ts Thyme, Dried
      2 c  Water                           1 1/4 c  Olive Oil
     10 md Cloves Garlic, Peeled             1/4 c  Vegetable Oil
 
  MICROWAVE OVEN METHOD: Combine tomatoes, water, garlic, oregano and thyme
  in a 13x9x2-inch oval glass or ceramic dish.  Cover tightly with microwave
  plastic wrap. Cook at 100% in a high-wattage oven for 8 minutes. Prick
  plastic to release steam. Remove from oven and uncover.  Stir well.
  Re-cover and cook for 8 minutes longer.  Prick plastic to release steam.
  Remove from oven and uncover.  Stir well and allow to stand, stirring
  occasionally, until cool and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Transfer
  to a 1-1/2-quart souffle dish.  Pour 3/4 cup of the olive oil and the
  vegetable oil over the tomato mixture. Cover tightly with microwave plastic
  wrap and cook for 5 minutes.  Prick plastic to release steam. Remove from
  oven and uncover.  Stir and allow to stand until cool. Transfer to the work
  bowl of a food processor and puree until smooth. Scrape into a large bowl
  and stir in remaining olive oil if serving immediately. Otherwise, pack in
  a refrigerator storage container with a tightly fitting lid. The dip will
  keep as long as a month, so think about making the whole quantity.
  STOVE-TOP METHOD: Cover sun-dried tomatoes with water in nonreactive
  saucepan. Bring to a boil over med heat, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to a
  simmer and cook, covered, for 22 minutes. Allow to cool. Drain. Cook with
  oil, garlic, oregano and thyme over low heat, covered, for 20 minutes.
  Puree. Above makes 3 cups. Author's note: The sun-dried tomato dip is a
  real breakthrough.  At a recent cocktail party, 7 guests demanded the
  recipe. Buying sun-dried tomatoes dry in bulk instead of packed in oil
  makes them less expensive. Reviving them in the microwave means that you
  can use a minimum of liquid for optimum intensity of flavor. Then they be
  packed up in good quality olive oil (much better than that which comes with
  them in jars) to use as needed or to turn into this dip, with its rich,
  mystifying flavor.  The dip keeps for weeks in the refrigerator. You will
  want to have the ubiquitous sliced raw vegetables; fennel does well with
  this dip. You don't have to use a microwave oven; you can still make this
  dip even if it is slightly less intense in flavor. The reward is the
  cooking water. Save it to use for boiling pasta. Cooked either way, this
  dip makes a delicious pasta sauce. Below are timings for other amounts of
  sun-dried tomatoes so that you can multiply and divide the recipe as you
  want.  Almost every informal party requires at least one dip. Allow 1/4 cup
  per guest.  At bigger parties, I often supply two or three, spacing them
  around the room(s) with dippers at each location. MICROWAVE OVEN METHOD:
  FOR 1/4 POUND DRIED TOMATOES: With 1 cup water in a 2-1/2 quart souffle
  dish, cook, covered, at 100% in a high-wattage oven 5 minutes; prick
  plastic to release steam; stir; cook, uncovered, 5 minutes. In a
  low-wattage oven, cook 9 minutes and 9 minutes. FOR 1/2 POUND DRIED
  TOMATOES: With 2 cups water in a 13x9x2-inch oval glass or ceramic dish,
  cook in a high-wattage oven 8 minutes, then 8 minutes. In a low-wattage
  oven, cook 12 minutes and 14 minutes. FOR 1 POUND DRIED TOMATOES: With 4
  cups water in a 5-quart casserole, cook in a high-wattage oven 14 minutes,
  then 14 minutes.  In a low-wattage oven, cook 20 minutes and 20 minutes.
  STOVE-TOP METHOD: Cover sun-dried tomatoes with water in a nonreactive
  saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to
  a simmer and cook, covered, for 22 minutes. Allow to cool. Drain. Recipe

      3 oz Cream cheese; softened              1 ds Pepper or cayenne
      2 ts Lemon juice                         1 c  Crab meat, flaked
      1 tb Minced chives                      25    Fresh asparagus spears
      1 ts Minced fresh dill or mint          25    Tulip petals
           -(Optional)                    
 
  In a medium bowl, beat cheese with lemon juice, herbs, and pepper; stir in
  crab.
  
  Break tough ends off asparagus.  Blanch in 1 inch of boiling water in a
  large skillet with a lid, or steam standing upright in a couple of inches
  of water in a tall, narrow pot, until crisp-tender, 2 to 5 minutes,
  depending on thickness of stems.  Plunge into an ice-water bath for 1
  minute; then pat dry.  Trim asparagus to abut 5 inches; from the trimmings,
  cut as many 1/4-inch rounds as you have tulip petals.  Save extra ends for
  salads.
  
  Fill each tulip petal with about 1/2 a rounded teaspoon of crab mixture and
  garnish with an asparagus round.  (If your petals are large and asparagus
  thin, you can use 3 rounds to garnish each filled petal.) Arrange asparagus
  in a fan on a serving platter and place tulip petals alternately (or create
  your own pattern).

      Title: Vidalia Onion Tart
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Filling                           1/4 c  Peanut oil
      2 lb Vidalia sweet onions                     Pie pastry; see below
      2    Egg yolks                                Pie pastry
      6 tb Heavy cream                         2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Water                             1/2 c  Unsalted butter
    1/4 lb Bacon; cut in strips                2    Egg yolks
      1 ts Flour                               1 ts Salt
      1 ts Salt                                6 tb Cold water
 
  FILLING: Slice onions thinly and layer in large saucepan. Add 1 teaspoon of
  salt to them and set aside to draw out the water for at least 30 minutes.
  Add 1/4 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of water.  Steam onions until transparent
  and water is cooked out.  Meanwhile, place sliced bacon in a small amount
  of water in a shallow pan and blanch to remove excess fat. Bacon should be
  limp.  Pour off liquid and coarsely chop.  When water is cooked out of
  onions, add 1 teaspoon of flour and stir to dissolve.
  
  Remove from heat and add 2 egg yolks and cream with the onions. Stir
  constantly.
  
  PIE PASTRY: Sift flour onto a pastry board, cloth or dough bowl and make a
  large well in the center. Pound butter to soften slightly or have at room
  temperature.  Place butter, egg yolks, salt and smaller amount of water in
  the well and work together with the fingertips of one hand until partly
  mixed.  Gradually work in flour, pulling dough into large crumbs using the
  fingertips of both hands.  If the crumbs are dry, sprinkle over a
  tablespoon of more water.  Press dough firmly together - it should be soft,
  but not sticky.  Work on a lightly floured board, pushing dough away with
  the heel of the hand and gathering it up with a dough scraper until smooth
  and pliable.  Press dough into a ball. Wrap in foil or plastic wrap and
  chill for 30 minutes. It can be stored tightly wrapped in the refrigerator
  for up to 3 days.
  
  DIRECTIONS: Roll pastry to about 1/2 inch thickness in a rectangular shape.
  Place pastry on an oiled baking sheet. Crimp edges of pastry if desired.
  Beat an egg yolk with a pinch of salt and brush over the entire pastry.
  This is called "egg glazing" and helps the filling adhere to the pastry.
  Pierce pastry with a fork in several places to prevent bubbles from forming
  while baking. Spread onion mixture over the pastry and sprinkle the chopped
  bacon on top. Bake at 300 degrees F. for 10 to 15 minutes or until nicely
  borwned. Cut into 1 inch squares for hors d'oeuvres. May be made a day
  ahead and reheated. Wait to cut until after heating if made ahead. May be
  baked in individual tartlet pans or a pie plate. From "Sweet Vidalia

    1/4 ts -Dried oregano                

--------------------------------THE EGGPLANT--------------------------------
    1/2 lb Japanese eggplants; -=OR=-               - or more to taste
      1 md -Firm shiny eggplant                     Lemon juice
      1 lg Garlic clove; thinly sliced              -=OR=- Red Wine Vinegar
      1    Bay leaf                                 Salt
           Thyme branches, if available             Coarsely ground pepper
      1 tb Extra-virgin olive oil                   Fresh herbs for garnish
 
  PREHEAT OVER TO 400F. Combine the first 5 ingredients in a bowl and set
  aside. Cut 5-or-6 long slits in the eggplant (fewer if you're using
  Japanese eggplants) and place a slice of garlic into each slit. Wrap the
  eggplant, together with the bay leaf and thyme branches, tightly in foil
  and bake until completely soft all over--45 minutes-to-1 1/2 hours,
  depending on the size of the eggplant. If you're using the large eggplant,
  turn it over after 45 minutes and continue baking until soft to the touch
  and tender at the stem end. When done, remove eggplant from the oven, open
  the package and let sit for 5 minutes or so. Discard any liquid. When the
  eggplant is cool enough to handle, scrape the flesh away from the skin, put
  it into a food processor and add the yogurt mixture and the olive oil.
  Process until smooth, but leave a little texture. Stir in the lemon juice
  or vinegar to taste and season with salt. Turn the puree into a serving
  bowl and season with pepper and fresh herbs, such as thyme leaves and
  blossoms, marjoram or oregano. If those herbs aren't available, use some
  chopped parsley or scallions. Serve the spread at room temperature with
  crackers, pita bread or bread toasted and brushed with olive oil.

      Title: Zucchini and Basil Filo
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 pk Frozen filo pastry                       - (loosely packed)
      6 md Zucchini                            3 tb Parsley, minced
    1/2 ts Salt                              1/4 c  White wine or water
    3/4 c  Pine nuts                           2    Eggs
      2 tb Virgin olive oil                  2/3 c  Parmesan, grated
      1 sm Red onion                           3 oz Feta cheese, crumbled
           - diced into 1/4-inch pieces        8 tb Unsalted butter; melted
           Pepper                                   - (or a mixture of
      2    Garlic clove; minced                     - butter and olive oil)
    1/2 c  Chopped basil                  
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Remove filo pastry from freezer and let it come to
  room temperature while you prepare the filling. Unfold the dough, and cut
  the stack of sheets in two. If you are making just one recipe, refold half
  the dough, and wrap it in plastic. It can either be refrozen or kept for a
  few days in the refrigerator. Cover the sheets to be used with a sheet of
  waxed paper covered in turn with a damp kitchen towel, to keep them from
  becoming dry and brittle. Grate the zucchini on the large holes of a hand
  grater or in a food processor. Toss with the salt and set aside for 30
  minutes. Then drain and squeeze dry in a clean kitchen towel. Roast the
  pine nuts for 5-to-8 minutes in oven, chop them finely, and set them aside.
  Heat the olive oil in a large skillet and saute the onion until it begins
  to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the zucchini, season with freshly ground
  black pepper, and cook another 4 minutes; then add the garlic, basil,
  parsley and white wine or water. Cover for 3 to 4 minutes, and remove from
  heat. Beat the eggs, stir in the cheeses, then cook the vegetables. Check
  the seasoning. Brush a 9-by-13-by-2-inch pan with the melted butter and lay
  a sheet of filo pastry with butter, or mixture of butter and olive oil, and
  continue buttering and layering, until you have used half the sheets.
  Scatter half of the chopped pine nuts between several of the layers. Brush
  the top layer with butter and spread the filling over it. Continue layering
  the rest of the pastry sheets. If the butter begins to congeal, reheat it
  so it spreads easily. Cut the assembled pastry into 3-inch squares, then
  into diamonds, making sure you cut through all the layers; refrigerate the
  pastry if you will not be baking right away. Bake in a preheated 400F oven
  for 40 to 50 minutes, or until browned. Serve the pastries warm from the
  oven, slightly cooled, or at room temperature. Makes one 9-by-13-inch filo

      Title: Amaretti
 Categories: Cookies, Italian
      Yield: 42 servings
 
    1/2 lb Canned almond paste                      Granulated sugar
      1 c  Sugar                                    - for dusting
      2 lg Egg whites                     
 
  PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 375F. Break the almond paste into small pieces and
  combine it with the sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer. Mix on low
  speed until very fine. Add egg whites in 4 additions, mixing about 1 minute
  between each. Beat the paste until very smooth, about 2-to-3 minutes. Fill
  a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tube with the mixture. Line 2
  cookie sheets or jelly roll pans with parchment paper. Pipe the mixture on
  the paper in 1-to-1 1/2-inch mounds, about 1-inch apart. Fold a clean
  kitchen towel into a long strip and moisten the towel with water. Squeeze
  lightly to eliminate excess water, leaving the towel more than damp. Slap
  the surface of the Amaretti gently with the towel to moisten them and make
  the surface smooth. Sprinkle the Amaretti with granulated sugar. Bake about
  15-to-20 minutes, until they are well risen, a deep golden color, and their
  surface is covered with tiny cracks. Remove from the oven and place the
  pans on racks to cool. To remove the Amaretti from the papers, turn the
  papers over with the Amaretti still adhering to them and wet the papers
  with hot water, using a brush. Leave a few minutes, then pull on the papers
  to release the Amaretti.
  
  HERE ARE 2 VARIATIONS OF AMARETTI: Amaretti di Pinoli: After moistening the
  piped Amaretti, strew them with pine nuts, sprinkling them on heavily, then
  pressing lightly with the fingertips so that the pine nuts adhere. Do not
  dust with sugar. Bake as for the Amaretti. Fior di Mandorla: This variation
  of Amaretti is popular in Southern Italy and Sicily, where the mixture is
  sometimes colored green or pink during the mixing. Their rough, craggy
  appearance is a nice contrast to the smoothness of the standard Amaretti.
  Prepare the Amaretti, up to, and including, moistening them with the towel.
  Dust heavily with confectioners' sugar and allow the piped mixture to dry
  at room temperature, uncovered, at least 12 hours, or overnight. After they
  have dried, indent each of the piped mounds with the thumb, first and
  middle fingers of one hand, positioning them equidistant around the
  circumference, and pinching gently inward, about half way into the center.
  Bake the Fior di Mandorla at 375F, about 15-to-20 minutes. Cool and loosen
  the Fior di Mandorla as for the Amaretti.

      Title: Amigthalota (Almond Pears)
 Categories: Greek, Candies
      Yield: 30 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      2 dr Almond essence
      3 c  Ground almonds                           Whole cloves
    1/2 c  Icing sugar; sifted                      Additional icing sugar
    1/4 c  Egg whites (1/4 c = 2 whites             Rose or orange flower water
    1/2 ts Grated lemon rind, optional              - (optional)
 
  Makes: 30 Cooking time: 20 minutes Oven temperature: 160 C (325 F)
  
  Blend ground almonds with icing sugar measured after sifting.  Add lightly
  beaten egg whites with lemon rind if used and almond essence.  Mix to a
  firm dough with hands.  Clean hands and rub with a little butter to prevent
  dough sticking while shaping.  Break off small pieces of dough the size of
  a walnut and form into pear shapes.  Insert a whole clove in the top of
  each to resemble a stem and place upright on a buttered and floured baking
  sheet.
  
  Bake in a moderately slow oven for 20 minutes, covering with brown paper if
  tops begin to brown.   Sift 2 cups icing sugar into a bowl and dip hot
  Amigthalota into it.  If desired, a little rose or orange flower water may
  be brushed onto Amigthalota before dipping into icing sugar.  Place on a
  wire rack to cool.
  
  Sift remaining sugar from bowl into base of a container and arrange cooled
  Almond Pears upright in a single layer.  Sift more sugar thickly over tops
  and sides, seal and store for a day or two before using.

      Title: Anginares Me Anitho - Artichokes with Dill
 Categories: Greek, Appetizers, Vegetables, Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      3 c  Water
     12 md Globe artichokes                         Salt
      1    Lemon (juice only)                       Freshly ground white pepper
           Lemon slices                        2 tb Finely chopped dill
      3 tb Flour (optional)                    3 ts Cornflour
    1/2 c  Chopped scallinos,white only             Cold water
    1/4 c  Olive or other oil                  2    Eggs
      1    Lemon (juice only)                       Chopped dill for garnish
 
  Serves: 4 as a light meal, 8 as a first course Cooking time: 45-50 minutes
  
  Wash artichokes well and cut off stem close to base.  Have ready a bowl of
  cold water with the juice of 1 lemon and some lemon slices added.  If
  desired stir in 2-3 tablespoons flour as this is quite effective in
  preventing discoloration.
  
  As each artichoke is prepared, rub cut surfaces with a lemon slice from the
  bowl and place in bowl until all are prepared.  Cook as soon as possible
  after preparation.
  
  Remove 3 or 4 layers of leaves until the tender inner leaves remain. Scoop
  out choke and pink thorny leaves from centre, using a spoon or melon ball
  scoop.  Cut in half.
  
  In a large pan gently fry spring onion in oil until soft.  Add juice of 1/2
  lemon, water, about 2 teaspoons salt and a good grinding of pepper. Bring
  to the boil.
  
  Drain prepared artichokes and add to pan with dill.  Return to a slow
  simmer, cover and simmer gently for 30 minutes or until artichokes are
  tender.  Stain cooking liquid into a pan and boil until reduced to half
  original quantity (about 1-1/2 cups).  Keep artichokes hot in a slow oven.
  
  Mix cornflour to a paste with a little cold water and stir into simmering
  liquid.  Stir until thickened and bubbling and leave to simmer gently.
  
  Beat eggs in a mixing bowl until light and frothy and gradually add
  remaining lemon juice.  Gradually pour in simmering stock, beating
  constantly.  Return to pan and stir over low heat for a minute or 2 to cook
  the egg.
  
  Pile artichokes on a warm platter, pour sauce on top and sprinkle with
  chopped dill.  Serve as a light meal or as a first course.

      Title: Another Gyros
 Categories: Lamb, Greek
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Lean ground lamb                    1    Onion, grated
      2 sl Homemade bread, toasted and         1 ts Fresh savory, chopped
           -crumbled                                Salt, to taste
      1 ts Allspice, crushed                        Freshly ground pepper, to
      1 ts Coriander seed, crushed                  -taste
      1    Clove garlic, pressed                    Bacon slices (optional)
 
  In large bowl, combined all ingredients.  Mix well, kneading until mixture
  is stiff.  Make fingers of meat (about 5-inches longer and not over
  2-inches in diameter). Place fingers on skewer spacing about 1-inch apart.
  Cook over hot coals for 10 to 15 minutes, turning frequently until cooked
  through.
  
  You may wrap the "fingers" on the skewer with sliced bacon.  If anyone
  tries this, let me know how it works out.
  
  NOTE:  I have this frequently in Greece and here in the U.S., but as I have
  said, I view it as a "deli" item.  Krinos Foods has a "gyros kit" that is
  sold in the frozen food section of some supermarkets.

      Title: Apple Filling for Strudel
 Categories: Ethnic
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           *INGREDIENTS*                            -tart
     10 c  Apples, slices thin                 1 ts Cinnamon
      1    Stick butter                        1    Lemon rind (grandma does NOT
      1 c  Bread crumbs, very fine                  -use this)
      1 c  Sugar, or more if apples are      1/2    Stick butter, melted
 
  Source: Treasured Slovenian & International Recipes
  
  *DIRECTIONS* Melt stick of butter and lightly brown the bread crumbs. Set
  aside to cool. Sprinkle the cooled bread crumbs over the stretched dough.
  Spread the sliced apples evenly over the dough and sprinkle sugar, cinnamon
  and lemon rind over the apples. Melt the 1/2 stick of butter and when it
  has cooled spoon over the apples. Roll up dough. Place in well greased pan
  and bake in 350 F oven for one hour.
  
  notes: Be careful not to puncture the dough when transferring to the pan,
  otherwise the strudel will stick to the pan.
  
  *VARIATIONS* Instead of lemon rind Grandma uses lemon juice. Grandma also
  waits until the dough is ready to slice the apples, that way they don't
  turn brown. She also uses the slicer on the side of a grater to slice the
  apples really thin.

      Title: Arnaki Se Fillo (Lamb in Fillo)
 Categories: Greek, Meats, Lamb
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                     12    Fillo sheets
      6    Boneless lamb leg steaks *        1/2 c  Butter; melted
           Freshly ground black pepper              Salt
      2 tb Butter or oil                       3 md Tomatoes; peeled
      2 md Onions; sliced                      1 ts Rigani or oregano
      1    Garlic clove                      125 g  Feta cheese; cut in 6 slices
 
  *Note: Lamb steaks should be about 2 cm (3/4 inch) thick.
  
  Serves: 6 Oven temperature: 200 C (400 F) Cooking time: 25-30 minutes
  
  Trim steaks of most of the fat and shape neatly - trimmings can be used in
  a ground lamb dish.  Season with pepper.
  
  Heat butter or oil in a frying pan and brown steaks quickly on each side -
  do not cook through.  Lift out onto a dish and leave until cool.  Add
  onions to pan and fry gently until transparent, add garlic and remove from
  heat.
  
  Brush a sheet of fillo pastry with melted butter and place another sheet on
  top, brushing again with butter.  Fold in half to make almost a square of
  fillo.  Put aside and cover wtih a dry tea towel, then one dampened with
  warm water.  Repeat with remaining fillo to give 6 prepared squares. Take
  one square and brush top with butter - leave remaining pastry covered.
  Place a lamb steak in the centre and season lightly with salt. Top with
  onion-garlic mixture and cover with 2 slices of tomato.  Sprinkle with a
  little rigani, salt and pepper and place a slice of feta cheese on top.
  Bring up ends of fillo pastry and double-fold over top.  Fold in ends as
  you would a package then tuck ends underneath.  This is known as a the
  chemist's (druggist's) fold.  Place on a buttered baking tray.  Repeat with
  remaining ingredients.
  
  Brush tops and sides of packages lightly with melted butter and bake in a
  preheated hot oven for 15 minutes.  Serve immediately if possible, though
  they will survive in the oven with heat turned off for about 10 minutes.
  Garnish with parsley sprigs and serve with boiled green beans or zucchini
  dressed with olive and lemon juice.
  
  Note:  Medallions of lamb cut from a trimmed loin can be used instead of
  the steaks.  You will require 12, and place 2 in each package.

      Title: Arni Exohiko ("Surprise" Lamb, Country Style )
 Categories: Greek, Meats, Lamb
      Yield: 8 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                     16    Potato balls; parboiled
      2 tb Olive oil                          16    Cherry tomatoes; peeled
      8    Loin lamb chops                   1/2 lb Kasseri cheese; in 8 pieces
     18    Sheets commercial phyllo                 Salt & freshly ground pepper
      6 tb Butter; hot and melted            3/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      2 c  Peas; cooked and drained            1 pn Dried oregano
 
  *Note: 3/4-inch slices leg of lamb may be used instead of lamb chops.
  
  In a heavy skillet, heat the oil or butter and fry the lamb over high heat,
  turning frequently.  Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, then remove
  from the heat.  Meanwhile, unroll the filo sheets and cover with a damp
  towel.  In a small pan over low heat, have the butter hot without letting
  it brown. Remove two sheets of filo, brush with hot butter over the first,
  then cover with the second sheet and brush it with butter.  In the center
  of the buttered filo place 1 lamb chop, 2 tablspoons peas, 2 potato balls,
  2 cherry tomatoes, and a slice of kasseri.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper,
  a heaping tablespoon of parsley, and a pinch of oregano. Fold the filo
  around the lamb and vegetables like a sealed parcel.  Place, seam side
  down, on a buttered baking pan (approximately 11 x 15 x 3 inches) and set
  aside while you repeat the procedure with the remaining ingredients to make
  8 "parcels".  Brush hot butter on the tops, then bake in a moderate oven
  (350 F) for 45 to 50 minutes or until golden in color. Remove from the oven
  and arrange on a warm platter or on individual dishes. Serve warm, with a
  fresh-cooked or raw vegetable salad.
  
  Note: The vegetables and herbs may be varied.  Substitute green beans or
  lima beans for peas, use thyme or basil instead of oregano.  Arni Exohiko
  is frequently prepared using buttered waxed paper, parchment paper or
  aluminum foil rather than with filo.

      1 tb Cornflour                                Salt
      3    Eggs; separated                          Freshly ground white pepper
 
  Serves: 4-6 Cooking time: 1 3/4 to 2 hours
  
  In a heavy-based saucepan or Dutch oven gently fry onion in butter until
  transparent.  Increase heat and add cubed lamb.  Cook, stirring constantly,
  until meat juices evaporate.  Meat should not brown.  Reduce heat and add
  hot water, herbs and salt and pepper to taste.  Cover and simmer gently for
  1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Add prepared vegetable and continue to cook until lambe
  and vegetables are tender.  Carefully drain liquid from pan into a
  measuring jug and make up to 1 1/2 cups with hot water or stock. Keep pan
  contents hot.
  
  Make Egg and Lemon Sauce:  Bring stock to the boil.  Mix cornflour to a
  paste with a little cold water and add to stock, stirring until thickened
  and bubbling.  Let it boil for 1 minute.  In a bowl, beat egg whites until
  stiff, add egg yolks and continue beating until light and fluffy.  Add
  lemon juice gradually, beating constantly.  Gradually pour in boiling,
  thickened stock, beating constantly.  Return sauce to pan and cook,
  stirring constantly, over low heat for 1 to 2 minutes to cook the egg.  Do
  not allow sauce to boil.  Remove from heat and continue to stir for 1
  minute.  Season to taste.
  
  Pour Egg and Lemon Sauce over lamb and vegetable, cover and leave at the
  side of the stove for 5 minutes.  Arrange lamb and vegetable on a serving
  dish and sprinkle with chopped herb.  Serve immediately with crusty bread
  and a chilled white wine.
  
  *Note:  Use any one of the following for the vegetable:
  
  8-12 small globe artichoke hearts.  Add to meat about 1 hour and cook for
  further 30-45 minutes.
  
  500 g (1 lb) celery stalks cut into 8 cm (3 inch) lengths and blanched in
  boiling, salted water for 5 minutes.  Drain, add to meat after 1 hour and
  cook for further 45 minutes.  Pork can be used instead of lamb with this
  vegetable.
  
  4 heads endive, washed well and trimmed of any coarse leaves.  Slit heads
  in half lengthways and blanch in boiling salted water for 2 minutes. Drain,
  add to meat after 1 1/2 hours and cook for further 15 minutes.
  
  4 small firm heads lettuce, washed well and quartered.  Place in a colander
  and scald with boiling water.  Add after 1 1/2 hours and cook for further
  15 minutes.

      Title: Arroz De Bacalhau
 Categories: Fish/sea, Portuguese
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Onion                                    - peeled, cored
           - peeled and thinly sliced               - and very coarsely chopped
      4 tb Olive oil                                Salt and pepper to taste
      1    Steak dried salt cod            1 2/3 c  Short-grain rice
      1    Ripe tomato (or dbl. amt.)     
 
  Short-grain rice adds the perfect texture to this traditional dish from
  northern Portugal. The salt cod may eliminate the need for additional salt.
  
  BROWN THE ONION in the olive oil in a large heavy saucepan over moderate
  heat. Meanwhile, shred the cod, remove the skin and bones and wash but do
  not soak. Add the cod to the onion, cover and simmer for about 10 minutes.
  Add the tomatoes and leave to cook 20-to-30 minutes, covered, over low
  heat. Meanwhile, wash and drain the rice. Add 3 1/3 cups water to the pan
  (add twice as much water as there is rice), season to taste with salt and
  pepper. When the water boils, add the rice and continue to cook on low heat
  until the rice is done--probably 25-to-30 minutes. Cover the kettle for the
  last half of cooking.

  minutes. Drain in a colander, spray with cold water, and pat dry. Lay
  asparagus out on a platter. Melt 3 tablespoons of butter and drizzle it
  over asparagus spears. Put beaten eggs on one plate and flour for dredging
  on another. Heat remaining butter and oil in a skillet. Wrap each asparagus
  spear in a slice of prosciutto. Roll them in flour (brush off excess), dip

  few minutes less and roll 2 spears in each slice of prosciutto.
