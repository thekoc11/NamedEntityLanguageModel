                      Apple-Walnut Upside-Down Cake

Recipe By     : Eating Well, October 1996
Serving Size  : 10   Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Cakes & Frostings

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        --apple topping--
     3/4  cups          sugar
   4      cups          peeled golden delicious apples -- thinly sliced
                        --3 to 4 apples
   1      tablespoon    fresh lemon juice
                        --walnut cake--
     3/4  cups          walnut halves
     2/3  cups          unsifted cake flour
   1      teaspoon      baking powder
     1/4  teaspoon      salt
   2      large         egg whites
     2/3  cups          sugar
   2      large         eggs
   1      teaspoon      pure vanilla extract

TO MAKE APPLE TOPPING:

1. Preheat oven to 375°F. Lightly oil a 9-inch round cake pan with sides at least 2 inches high or coat it with nonstick cooking spray.

2. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine sugar and 1/4 cup water. Bring to a simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally. Increase the heat to medium high and cook, without stirring, until the syrup turns a deep amber color, about 5 minutes. (Swirl the pan if the syrup is coloring unevenly.) Immediately pour the syrup into the prepared cake pan.

3. In a bowl, toss apple slices with lemon juice. Evenly press the apples into the warm caramel and set aside.

TO MAKE WALNUT CAKE:

1. Spread walnuts in a pie pan and bake for 5 minutes or until fragrant; let cool slightly. In a food processor, combine the walnuts, flour, baking powder and salt; process until the walnuts are ground to a coarse meal.

2. In a mixing bowl, beat the 2 egg whites with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. One tablespoon at a time, beat in 1/3 cup of the sugar, continuing to beat until the egg whites are stiff and glossy; set aside.

3. In a separate mixing bowl, beat the 2 whole eggs with the remaining 1/3 cup sugar until thick and pale, about 5 minutes. Beat in vanilla.

4. Whisk one-fourth of the reserved beaten egg whites into the whole-egg mixture. Sprinkle half of the dry ingredients over the top and fold in gently using a rubber spatula. Fold in the remaining beaten whites, followed by the remaining dry ingredients.

5. Spread the batter over the fruit in the pan. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the top springs back when lightly touched and a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then invert onto a serving plate, setting any stray apples back in place. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Makes one 9-inch cake, for 10 servings.

   8      ounces        pitted prunes
   6      tablespoons   hot water.

Making prune puree is quick and easy: Puree 1 1/3 cups (8 ounces) pitted prunes and 6 tablespoons hot water in food processor until smooth. To store, cover and refrigerate for up to one month.

Prunes are packed with important nutrients like potassium, vitamin A and iron, and are a good source of dietary fiber. Research has found that prunes also contain phytochemicals, substances found in fruits and vegetables, which are linked to reducing the risk of certain types of cancer and heart disease.

Prune puree can replace almost all of the butter, shortening or oil in cakes, cookies, quickbreads, brownies and muffins by 50 to 90 percent.

Look for prepared fruit puree fat replacement with prunes in the cooking oil or baking ingredients section of the supermarket.

  15      ounces        unseasoned pumpkin puree
     1/3  cup           fresh orange juice
     1/4  cup           canola oil

                        ***CARAMEL-WALNUT GLAZE***

   2      tablespoons   1% milk
                        --or evaporated skim milk
   2      teaspoons     butter

TO MAKE CAKE:

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly oil a 12-cup Bundt or tube pan or coat it with nonstick spray. Dust pan with flour, tilting to coat and tapping out the excess.

2. Spread walnuts in a shallow pan and bake until fragrant, about 5 minutes; let cool. Chop walnuts and set aside.

3. In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, salt and spices.

4. In a large mixing bowl, combine eggs, egg white and brown sugar. Beat with an electric mixer until fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add pumpkin, orange juice, oil and vanilla; beat until smooth.

5. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients and stir until just combined. Set aside 2 tablespoons walnuts for the glaze and fold the rest into the batter.

6. Scrape batter into prepared pan. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted in the center comes out clean. Transfer to a wire rack. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes.

TO MAKE GLAZE:

1. While cake is cooling in pan, in a small saucepan, combine brown sugar, milk and butter. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently, over medium heat. Cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in reserved 2 tablespoons walnuts.

2. Tum cake out onto rack; place rack over a baking sheet. Drizzle warm glaze over the top and sides of the cake. Transfer to a serving platter and spoon any glaze from the baking sheet over the cake. Let cool completely.
