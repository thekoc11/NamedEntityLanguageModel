      Title: Absolutely Deep Dark Chocolate Fudge Biscuits
 Categories: Cookies, Chocolate, Low-fat
      Yield: 36 servings
 
  7 1/2 oz All-purpose flour
      2 oz Cocoa powder
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Salt
      8 oz Chocolate; broken in 16 pcs
      4 oz Unsweetened chocolate;
           -broken in 8 pcs
     12 oz Light brown sugar
      6 oz Unsalted butter
      3    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla
  1 1/2 lb Chocolate chips
 
  Recipe by: Paul Vincent <KNDUSR18@MSMAIL-GATEWAY.UNIVERSITY-CENTRAL- EN
  [Note: Instead of the unsweetened chocolate, I just used an extra 4ozs of
  plain chocolate, and got perfect results. I think as long as you're using
  *really* good plain chocolate, say at least 55% cocoa solids, it doesn't
  really matter!]
  
  Preheat the oven to 325F / 170C / Gas 3.
  
  Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt. Set
  aside.
  
  Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium
  heat. Place the plain and the unsweetened chocolates in the top half of the
  double boiler. Tightly cover the top with cling film and allow to heat for
  12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir until smooth. Keep at room
  temperature until needed.
  
  Place the soft light brown sugar and butter in the bowl of an electric
  mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat on medium for 1 minute. Scrape down the
  bowl and beat on high for an additional 30 seconds. Scrape down the bowl.
  Add the eggs, one at a time, while beating on medium, and stopping to
  scrape down the bowl after incorporating each addition. Add the vanilla
  essence and beat on medium for 30 seconds. Add the melted chocolate and
  beat on low for 10 seconds more. Scrape down the bowl and beat for an
  additional 30 seconds. Add the sifted flour, cocoa powder, bicarbonate of
  soda, and salt, and the chocolate chips, and beat on low until thoroughly
  combined - about 20 to 30 seconds. Remove the bowl from the mixer and mix
  thoroughly with a rubber spatula.
  
  Portion 6 to 8 biscuits per baking sheet by dropping 2 level tablespoons of
  batter per biscuit onto each of 2 non-stick baking sheets. Place the
  biscuits on the top and middle shelves of the preheated oven and bake for
  18 to 22 minutes, rotating the sheets from top to bottom about halfway
  through the baking time. Allow the biscuits to cool for 5 to 6 minutes on
  the baking sheets. Transfer the biscuits to a cooling rack to thoroughly
  cool before storing in a sealed plastic container. Repeat this procedure
  until all the biscuits have been baked.
  
  Makes 3 to 3.5 dozen biscuits

    1/2 c  Wheat flour
    1/2 c  Oatmeal
    1/2 c  Applesauce
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
 
  Recipe by: Net 1. Chop up the apples and place them in a 8x8 inch baking
  pan (use a bit of PAM or an equivalent to lightly "grease" the pan. But you
  can probably get away without it).
   2.  Pour the maple syrup over the apples and then sprinkle cinnamon over
  it all (I like to use lots! :) ).
   3.  In a bowl, mix together the flour and oatmeal.  Then add the
  applesauce and brown sugar, and mix until the flour is just moistened and
  even a bit dry in some parts.
   4.  Spread (or sort of "spoon and pat") the flour/oatmeal/applesauce/brown
  sugar mixture onto the apples.  It doesn't have to spread from edge to edge
  ~ just spread it out best you can and don't worry about empty spots! 5.
  Bake this in the oven at 375 degrees fahrenheit for about 35 minutes.

 Categories: Vegetable, Casseroles, Low-fat
      Yield: 6 servings
 
--------------------------------MIAMI HERALD--------------------------------
      3 md Artichokes
      1 tb Lemon juice
      2 c  Water
      4 md Potatoes
      2 tb Oil, olive
      2 ts Thyme leaves
      1 ts Garlic salt
    1/8 ts Black pepper
    1/2 c  Bread crumbs
    1/2 c  Stock, chicken
 
  Bend back outer petals of artichokes until they snap off easily near base.
  Edible portion of petals should remain on artichoke hearts. Continue to
  snap off and discard petals until central core of pale green petals is
  reached.  Cut off stems and top third of artichokes; discard. Trim outer
  dark green layer from bottoms.  Quarter artichokes lengthwise. Cut out
  center petals and fuzzy centers. Vertically slice each quarter into 3-4
  wedges.  Dip slices in mixture of water and lemon juice.
  
  Preheat oven to 425.  Thinly slice unpeeled potatoes.  Place layer of
  potato slices on bottom of greased 2-1/2-qt baking dish.  Arrange layer of
  artichoke slices on potato slices.  Sprinkle with spices and drizzle with
  part of olive oil.
  
  Repeat layers, ending with potato layer, until all ingredients are used.
  Pour hot chicken broth evenly over surface; sprinkle with bread crumbs and
  drizzle with remaining oil.  Cover with foil and bake 30 minutes.
  
  Remove foil and bake 30-45 minutes longer, until potatoes and artichokes
  are tender.
  
  Sylvia's comments: this was an interesting way to prepare artichokes for a
  casserole!  I cut them into very thin wedges to make more. I used a very
  large baking pan, and the stack was so short that way I think I'd have been
  better off using an 8x8" pan. It was surprisingly tasty for something with
  very simple ingredients.

  cheese slices over chicken.  Mix soup with sherry; pour over cheese.
  Sprinkle with croutons; dot with butter.  Bake 1 hour, or until tender.
  
  Sylvia's comments: GREAT recipe!  I used shredded cheddar instead of sliced
  Swiss, and Special Request cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery.
  And I threw in a can of mushrooms.  I didn't use the croutons or butter at
  all.  I suspected an hour was WAY too long; after 30 minutes, they were
  just barely done, tender and juicy.  It tasted good with hot cooked rice.

      8 sl Bread
     12 oz Evaporated skim milk
      4    Eggs
    1/4 c  Brown sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
    3/4 ts Ground cinnamon
 
  Lightly coat 9"x13"x2" pan with non-stick vegetable spray.  Arrange bread
  slices in bottom of pan.  Combine all remaining ingredients and mix well,
  using whisk or egg beater.  Pour mixture evenly over bread. Cover tightly
  and refrigerate several hours or overnight.
  
  To bake, preheat oven to 350.  Remove bread from refrigerator and spray
  lightly with non-stick vegetable spray.  Bake 30-35 minutes, until lightly
  browned.  Serve with hot maple syrup, powdered sugar, and cinnamon.
  
  Sylvia's notes: this worked fine, came out reasonably crisp on the outside
  and reasonably soggy on the inside.  Definitely a fine lower-fat
  alternative to the traditional fried french toast.

  From the Cake book of the Simply Healthful cookbook series by Chapters
  
  While using jars of baby food fruit purees in some cake is preferable when
  you want to downplay the flavor of the fruit, other cakes work better with
  stronger-tasting homemade fruit purees. In this cake, freshly pureed dried
  dates take the place of nuts, not only reducing fat but adding flavor and
  a good, chewy texture. You can, of course, add the nuts and make this a
  banana-date-nut cake. In place of nonfat milk and vinegar, 2/3 cup of
  buttermilk may be substituted.
  
  1. Prepare date puree: Puree dates, water and vanilla in blender or food
  processor. (Makes about 3/4 cup) 2. Preheat oven to 350. Lightly butter
  12-cup Bundt pan or spray with nonstick cooking spray. Mix together nonfat
  milk and vinegar. let stand until thickened. Sift together flour, sugar,
  baking powder, baking soda and salt in large mixing bowl. Stir to blend.
  3. In another bowl, lightly beat egg substitute and egg white. Add to
  flour mixture with bananas, 3/4 cup date puree, vinegar mixture, vanilla
  and walnuts, if using. Stir just until blended. Pour into prepared pan.
  Bake for 45 to 55 minutes, or until wooden pick inserted in center comes
  out clean. Let cake cool in pan 10 minutes. Unmold onto serving platter.
  Sprinkle with chopped walnuts and powdered sugar, if desired.

      1 lb Shelled fresh beans*
    1/2 c  Olive oil
           Several sprigs fresh thyme

  *Try limas,favas,haricots,crowders.
  
  This famous Tuscan dish is a quaint way to cook fresh white shelled beans.
  To do it the traditional way, strip the straw covering from a Chianti
  bottle. Fill the bottle with beans, olive oil and herbs. Bake it for 3
  hours in a bed of charcoal ashes. The flavor of the smoke and oil perfumes
  the delicate beans, which you can then use as part of an antipasto
  arrangement. If you don't have a convenient bottle, you may use a casserole
  dish. And if you don't have fresh beans, use dried ones that you have
  soaked.

      Title: Black Bean Soup
 Categories: Bean, Low-fat, Soup/stew
      Yield: 1 batch
 
------------------------MODIFIED FROM THE SAVORY WAY------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Black beans, rinsed and
           Soaked 6 hours or overnight
      1    Onion, diced
      4    Garlic cloves,finely chopped
           Pureed chipotles in adobo to
           Taste
      1    16 ounce can tomatos,
           Chopped, juice reserved
    1/2 bn Cilantro (optional)
 
   Drain the beans and put them in a soup pot with enough cold water to
   cover them by a couple of inches.  Bring to a boil and skim off the
   foam that rises to the surface, then add the onions and the garlic.
   Lower the heat and cook until the onions are soft, about 15 minutes,
   then add the tomatoes and their juice, the pureed chilies, half the
   cilantro (if used), and lightly salt.  Simmer until the beans are
   tender, an hour or so.  Occasionally give them a stir while they're
   cooking.  When done, taste for salt, stir in the remaining cilantro,
   and garnish as desired with either sour cream, grated Muenster or
   Monterey Jack cheese.
  
   PRESSURE COOKER METHOD:  Drain the beans and put them in a 6 ltr
   pressure cooker with enough cold water to cover them by a couple of
   inches.  Add the onion and garlic.  Bring to high pressure and cook for
   11 minutes.  Remove from heat & let pressure reduce.  Drain the beans,
   stir in the remaining ingredients.  Garnish as desired.

  1 Tbsp olive or canola oil
  2 lg onions, cut in eighths
  8 carrots, cut in 2" pieces
  4 stalks celery, cut in 2" pieces
  1/2 c red wine vinegar (or 1 c red wine)
  1-1/2 c low-fat beef stock
  1 bay leaf
  1/2 tsp dried thyme
  1/8 tsp each salt and pepper
  
  Trim fat from beef. Cut a length of kitchen string about four times the
  length of the roast and wrap once around the length, then around width
  several times, tying where it comes together.
  
  In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over moderately high heat. Brown beef on
  all sides. Transfer to a plate. Add vegetables to pan and saute for about
  7 minutes or until browned and slightly softened. Transfer to a plate.
  
  Return beef to pan. Add wine vinegar, stock, herbs, salt and pepper. Stir
  to blend. Cover and simmer gently about two hours, turning meat every 30
  minutes.
  
  Return vegetables to pot, cover, and simmer about 15 minutes, or until
  beef is very tender. Discard bay leaf. Slice meat and arrange on platter
  surrounded by vegetables. Serve with pot juices.

  NOTES: I use bottom round roast instead of chuck to cut down even more on
  the fat content. Using bottom round you can skip the string tie. It isn't
  needed. We also prefer wine vinegar to wine. It adds a lovely tang to the
  recipe.

  Sylvia's comments: this is so rich-tasting you won't believe it's virtually
  fat-free.  I was afraid there wouldn't be enough juices, but there was
  plenty.  And I see no reason why vegetarians and/or McDougallers couldn't
  use vegetable stock instead of beef stock.

      1 cn Tomatoes
      1 ts Garlic cloves, crushed

      4    Chicken breasts; skinless
           Black pepper
 
  Drain tomatoes, reserving juice, and coarsely chop.  Melt butter in heavy
  skillet over medium heat.  Add artichokes and saute 2 minutes. Add tomatoes
  and garlic. Cook 1 minute.  Add tomato liquid. Increase heat and boil until
  liquid is reduced by half, stirring occcasionally, about 5 minutes.
  
  Keep warm.  Sauce can be made a day before. Reheat before continuing.
  
  Rub chicken on both sides with pepper.  Add chicken to sauce and cook about
  3 minutes per side until done.  Spoon sauce over chicken and serve.
  
  Sylvia's comments: this was really good!  I used a can of tomatoes instead
  of fresh, and their juice instead of the chicken stock.  I also coarsely
  chopped the artichokes instead of just quartering them. 3 minutes per side
  was a joke for bone-in chicken; I had to remove the meat from the bones and
  return to the pan for a few minutes. Served over rice, yummm!

      Title: Cream Puff Shells
 Categories: Appetizer, Low-cal, Seasonings, Low-fat
      Yield: 24 servings
 
      1 c  Skim milk
      1 c  Flour
      8 ea Egg whites*
    1/3 c  Soft margarine
    1/8 ts Lite salt
 
  *Use egg whites at room temperature or 1 cup egg substitute (commercial or
  Homemade Egg Substitute ). Place milk and margarine in heavy saucepan.
  Bring to a boil and add flour and lite salt. Stir quickly with a wooden
  spoon. The batter looks rough at first, but suddenly becomes smooth, at
  which point you stir FASTER! In a few minutes the paste becomes dry and
  doesn't cling to spoon or pan. When a spoon pressed on dough leaves a
  smooth imprint, stop stirring and REMOVE FROM HEAT. Let sit for about two
  minutes, then beat in egg substitute or eggwhites one at a time. The
  proper consistancy has been reached when a small quantity of dough will
  stand up on the end of a spoon. Spoon onto a lightly oiled cookie sheet in
  small 3/4" balls. When pan is filled, moisten tip of finger and smooth
  down any points(otherwise they will burn). Sprinkle all of pan lightly
  with water(a spray bottle works well). Bake in 400 degree ovrn for 10
  minutes. Reduce heat to 350 and bake about 25 minutes more. Do not remove
  from oven until firm to the touch. Cool before filling.(May be frozen at
  this point for future use). Cut horizontally almost all the way through,
  and place a teaspoon of filling in each. Fill shortly before serving so
  puffs will not become soggy.

    1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Vinegar

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
    1/2 lb 99% fat free ground turkey
      1 c  Rosarita no fat Green Chili
           -and Lime refried beans
    1/4 c  Salsa (FRESH store bought
           -may be substituted)

----------------------------------ASSEMBLY----------------------------------
           Burrito filling
           FRESH salsa
      6    Mission fat free flour
           -tortillas; fajita sized
    1/2 c  Healthy choice nonfat
           -cheddar cheese, shredded
    1/3 c  Knudsen fat free sour cream
 
  For the salsa,
  Coarsely chop the tomatoes, onion, jalapeno and
  cilantro and process in food processor. Add red
  pepper, salt and vinegar, process until mixture is of
  small uniform chunks. Set aside.
  
  For the filling,
  Spray a nonstick frying pan with pam 1 time. Brown the
  turkey meat along with the 1/4 cup of salsa. You may
  wish to add a small amount of water, as ground turkey
  cooks up very very dry and absorbs all the moisture
  from the salsa. Add the beans. Heat and stir until
  beans are heated through.
  
  Assembly,
  Place tortillas on a plate and cover with a wet paper
  towel. Heat in microwave for 10-20 seconds. Sprinkle 1
  rounded tablespoon of the chees on 1 side of each
  tortilla. Evenly divide the burrito filling among the
  tortillas. Fold each tortilla like a soft taco,
  squishing the filling to fill the entire area. Serve
  with salsa and fat free sour cream.
  
  Note, may be frozen, but do not put fat free sour
  cream on before freezing because when reheated, the
  fat free sour cream gets a bad taste.
  
  3 servings, two burritos each. Nutrition per serving:
  346 cals; 1 g fat.

      1 pk Dry yeast
      3 c  Warm water
      2 c  Whole wheat flour
  3 1/2 c  Rye flour
      1 t  Salt
      3 T  Log Cabin maple syrup

      1    Potato, grated (medium
           -sized)
      1 lg Carrot, finely shredded
           -or grated.
           Enough white flour just
           -to hold dough together.
 
   *NOTE: Proportions of water needed may vary according to humidity,
  climate,
  weather, dry heating in your house.  Use almost all the water, then see if
  the dough is too dry.  If so add more a bit at a time.*
  
   Combine everything except the water and white flour. With your hands, add
  only enough of the water and the white flour to make the dough hold
  together
  without too much stickiness.  Knead only enough to get the dough to hold in
  a ball shape, then put it into an oiled bowl with a damp cloth over top and
  set it in a warm place (200 degree oven with heat OFF). Let dough rise 1
  1/2
  hours. Punch it down and let it rise for 45 minutes, Punch it down again
  and
  shape it into your oiled loaf pan.  Bake right away for 75 minutes. Remove
  from pan, cool, and refrigerate.
  
   Makes 1 large loaf
  
   This is a very dense, hearty bread with lots of body to it. And
  wonderfully
  simple to make.

      3 tb Minced dried apricots
      2 tb Chopped walnuts; or almonds
  1 1/2 ts Honey
      2 ts Orange juice concentrate
    1/8 ts Ground cinnamon; or cumin
 
  Dates may be substituted for the apricots.
  
  Line colander with double layer of cheesecloth or other suitable filter; I
  use a porous cloth napkin.  (Sylvia's note: I've lined the colander with a
  double layer of coffee filters.)  Place colander over large bowl to catch
  dripping whey.  Spoon yogurt into colander. Cover loosely with plastic wrap
  and refrigerate 6-24 hours.  The longer the refrigeration time, the thicker
  the resulting cheese. Discard whey or use in soups and casseroles. (Whey
  contains significant amounts of calcium and potassium.) 32 oz yogurt (must
  not contain gelatin) makes about 2 c cheese.
  
  Blend all ingredients well.

  Mix up the basting sauce in proportions to taste. Lay eggplant and onion

      Title: Herb Yogurt Cheese Spread
 Categories: Dip, Low-fat
      Yield: 1 cup
 
--------------------------USA WEEKEND; 9/2-4/1994--------------------------
      1 c  Yogurt cheese
      1 ts Garlic cloves, crushed
      3 tb Minced fresh herbs; basil,
           -parsley, chives, rosemary
           Salt and pepper; to taste
 
  Line colander with double layer of cheesecloth or other suitable filter; I
  use a porous cloth napkin.  (Sylvia's note: I've lined the colander with a
  double layer of coffee filters.)  Place colander over large bowl to catch
  dripping whey.  Spoon yogurt into colander. Cover loosely with plastic wrap
  and refrigerate 6-24 hours.  The longer the refrigeration time, the thicker
  the resulting cheese. Discard whey or use in soups and casseroles. (Whey
  contains significant amounts of calcium and potassium.) 32 oz yogurt (must
  not contain gelatin) makes about 2 c cheese.
  
  Mix yogurt cheese and seasonings.

  2 1/2 c  1% milk, divided
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
    1/8 ts Nutmeg

      4    Egg whites (or 2 egg-beaters
           - which is cheaper, BTW?)
    1/2 ts Vanilla
 
  Combine rice, 2 cups milk, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, sugar, & raisins. Bring
  to a rolling boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat; boil slowly 10
  minutes, stirring occasionally. Beat egg whites until just foamy, then mix
  with remaining milk. Slowly add to hot mixture, stirring constantly. Cook
  over medium heat until thickened. Add vanilla. Let cool 10 minutes.
  
  Recipe called for 2 eggs, & I just substituted the egg whites...  Seemed to
  work OK.
  
  The recipe didn't have the nutrition info, but when I looked everything
  up, it was very low, & divided by 6 servings, it was even lower (as far as
  fat content).  :)

 Categories: Pasta, Side dish, Freezer, Low-fat, Sauce
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 c  Fresh basil leaves; packed
    1/3 c  Parmesan cheese; freshly
           -grated
      1    Garlic clove; or to taste
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper; freshly ground
    1/3 c  Chicken stock; preferably
           -homemade
 
  In a food processor fitted with the meatl blade, combine the basil,
  Parmesan Cheese, garlic, salt and pepper, and pulse until chopped.  With
  the machine running, gradually add the chicken stock through the tube,
  scraping down the sides of the machine as needed, and process until smooth.
  May be prepared up to 2 days ahead.  Press a piece of plastic srap directly
  on the surface of the pesto to discourage discoloration, and refrigerate.
  
  Linda's Notes:  To freeze, put in ice cube trays and freeze until hard. Pop
  cubes out of trays and seal in zip-close bags, exhausting as much air as
  possible.  Freeze for up to 6 months at 0 F.
  
  Serve over hot cooked pasta (thaw first if frozen) or toss a cube with
  cooked vegetables.  A cube makes a nice addition to soups, especially bean
  soup.

  Note:  original recipe is for a sauce, try 2 tbsp cornstarch and
  divide among 3 dishes for a pudding/pie filling with one crumbled
  graham cracker and a shake of cinnamon in the bottom of each dish.
  
  EGGLESS:  1 or 2 extra tsp. cornstarch (5 tsp or 2 tb.) would likely
  thicken the sauce without the egg.  1 tsp. cornstarch plus 3 tb.

      Yield: 16 servings
 
      1 lg Onions, white, chopped
      2 ea Garlic cloves, crushed
      2 c  Lentils
      1 tb Oil, olive
      2 qt Water
      1 cn Tomatoes
      1    Bay leaves
      1 tb Salt
    1/2 ts Black pepper
    1/2 lb Summer sausage
 
  Briefly saute veggies in olive oil for 3-4 minutes.  Place all ingredients,
  except sausage, in a large pot and simmer, covered, for about 2 hours. Dice
  sausage without casings and simmer 10 minutes. Drain. Add to soup 1/2 hour
  before serving.  Top with Parmesan cheese.
  
  Sylvia's comments: rather than messing with diced summer sausage, I chopped
  up some bacon and threw it in an hour before cooking.  I probably didn't
  need to; the soup was very flavorful.  But this has kept a week in the
  fridge/cooler and has heated very well in the microwave at work.

      Title: Low Fat Greek Stew
 Categories: Stew, Low-fat
      Yield: 1 batch
 
      2 lb Beef; trimmed of all visible
           -fat and cubed
           Ground pepper to taste
      6 oz Tomato paste
      1 c  Dry white wine
      2 T  Raisins
    1/4 ts Cumin
      1 cl Garlic; pressed or minced
      1    Bay leaf
      1    Stick of cinnamon
      2 c  Frozen small white onions
 
  In a large pot combine meat and pepper.  Mix all the other ingredients
  except the onions and add to the meat.  Cover and bake in a 300 degree
  oven for about an hour, or until meat is tender.  Add onions and cook for
  10 minutes more.  Discard bay leaf, skim off any fat and serve over or
  with your favorite grain.
  
  This dish freezes very well.  If you make it to freeze add the onions when
  you reheat.  When making in a crock pot, just throw all the ingredients in
  in the morning, set pot on low, and dinner will be ready when you're back
  from work.
  
  My preference was to make it in the crock pot, refrigerate over night,
  scrap of any fat the next day, and then add the onions and reheat.
  Sometimes I'd make it without grinding the pepper, but just toss in a
  bunch of black pepper without grinding.

      Title: Low Fat, Baked "Chicken Fried" Steak
 Categories: Beef, Low-fat
      Yield: 3 servings
 
--------------------------------MISTY SIMON--------------------------------

-----------------------------------STEAK-----------------------------------
      9 oz Round steak, with the least
           -amount of marbling. Trim
           -off all visible fat. Weigh
           -after trimming.
    1/3 c  Bread crumbs
      1    Egg white
      2 tb Nonfat milk
        ds Salt and black pepper

-----------------------------------GRAVY-----------------------------------
      1 c  Nonfat milk
      2 tb Flour
      1 ts Chicken bouillon granules
        ds Black pepper
    1/8 ts Kitchen bouquet
 
  Line with foil and preheat broiler. I actually used
  the broil feature on my toaster oven.
  
  Cut round steak into 3 3oz steaks. Pound with a meat
  tenderizer with large points. Mix together egg white,
  milk and salt and pepper. Dip into egg mixture, then
  into bread crumbs.
  
  Spray foil with corn oil spray. Place steaks on foil
  and spray steaks lightly with spray. Broil, watching
  carefully until the steaks are light brown on top.
  When browned on top, remove from broiler onto plate,
  browned side down. I found that they let out a lot of
  juice, so the bottoms will be a little soggy at this
  point; so wipe off the foil before placing them turned
  over back into the broiler. Again, watch carefully
  until browned. Remove to a hot plate, cover and keep
  warm.
  
  For the gravy,
  Mix together, the milk and the flour. Start out with
  just a little milk and make a thick paste, then slowly
  stir in the remaining milk. This will help to avoid
  clumps. Heat on medium until boiling, stirring
  constantly. Cook and stir 1 minute. Reduce to lowest
  setting and add bouillion, pepper and kitchen bouquet.
  Heat and stir until bouillion is dissolved. Serve over
  steaks and over my "Fat Free Mashed Potatoes".
  
  3 servings. Steak and gravy has 264 calories and 7.4
  grams of fat per serving. Adding my "Fat Free Mashed
  Potatoes adds 98 calories and no fat for a total of

      Title: Low-Fat Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake
 Categories: Cheesecake, Raspberry, Low-fat
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           -For cheesecake:
 
  24 plain chocolate wafer cookies (half of a 9 ounce box)
  Nonfat cooking spray
  2 (8 ounce) packages fat-free cream cheese
  1 cup sugar
  1 cup cocoa
  1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
  3 Tablespoons sugar-free seedless black raspberry preserves
  1/2 cup fat free egg substitutes
  1 (16 ounce) container fat-free sour cream
  1/4 teaspoon salt
  
  For Fruit Topping:
  
  1 (10 ounce) box sweetened frozen raspberries, thawed
  2 Tablespoons cornstarch
  
  In a food processor or blender, grind the plain chocolate wafers
  into fine crumbs. Generously coat a 8.1/2 inch or 9 inch
  springform pan with nonstick cooking spray. Pour the crumbs into
  the pan and tilt to coat the bottom and the sides evenly. Set
  aside.
  
  Preheat oven to 350^F. With an electric mixer, beat the fat-free
  cream cheese until soft. Add the sugar, cocoa, vanilla extract
  and raspberry preserves and continue beating until the
  ingredients are incorporated. Add the egg substitutes, fat free
  sour cream and salt and continue beating until no lumps remain
  and mixture is smooth and liquid. You may have to beat the
  mixture for several minutes to reach this consistency.
  
  Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Place in oven and
  immediately reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees. Bake for one
  hour, or until center is set and firm to the touch. Turn off oven
  and allow cheesecake to stay in cooling oven for one hour longer.
  Remove and cool completely. Refrigerate overnight before serving.
  
  To make the raspberry sauce, puree the raspberries in a food
  processor or blender. Strain the pulp through a tea strainer,
  pressing to remove all the seeds. Discard seeds. Place the
  cornstarch in a saucepan and stir in the raspberry juice. Bring
  to a boil, stirring constantly until thickened. Remove from heat
  immediately to prevent lumps from forming.  Cool and chill.
  Serve one tablespoon of sauce on top of each slice of cheesecake.
  
  Cake can also be frozen for two to three weeks before serving. To
  serve, thaw for 2 days in the refrigerator, then allow to come to
  room temperature before slicing.

      Title: Low-Fat Corn Lasagna
 Categories: Casseroles, Vegetarian, Low-fat
      Yield: 8 servings
 
----------------------------DALLAS MORNING NEWS----------------------------
      1 c  Cheese, mozzarella
     10 oz Corn
     15 oz Cheese, ricotta
      1    Eggs
      1 ts Oregano leaves
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper, black
 27 1/2 oz Prego
      9    Lasagna noodles
      1 c  Water
    1/2 c  Cheese, mozzarella
 
  Use part-skim mozzarella and nonfat ricotta.
  
  Preheat oven to 325.  Spray 9"x13" baking dish with nonstick vegetable
  spray.  In mixing bowl, combine mozzarella, corn, ricotta, egg, oregano,
  salt, and pepper.  Line bottom of baking dish with 3/4 c sauce. Layer half
  of noodles and top with half of cheese mixture. Repeat and pour remaining
  sauce over top. Carefully pour water around edges and sprinkle with
  mozzarella.
  
  Tightly cover pan with foil and bake 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Let rest 10-15
  minutes before serving.
  
  Sylvia's comments:  I made this even lower fat: skipped the egg and the
  ricotta and only used 1 c cheese.  Big hit with the family, and it stayed
  good in the fridge almost a week before I got around to baking it.

  (optional) nuts evenly over dough (a few raisins would be nice also). Roll
  up and seal seams.
  
  Slice dough into 12 pieces.  Clean kitchen string or thread works best for
  this; slip string under roll where you want the cut to be, cross ends over
  top of roll and pull.  String will slice dough and cause less distortion
  than trying to cut with a knife.
  
  Arrange rolls, cut side down, in a pan sprayed with pan coating.  Let rise
  in a warm place until nearly doubled (about 30 minutes).  Meanwhile,
  preheat oven to 375 F.
  
  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden.
  
  Mix powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla together for icing while rolls are
  baking.  Remove from oven to serving dish and drizzle with icing.  Serve
  warm.  OR, wrap airtight and freeze for up to 3 weeks; thaw and heat in
  microwave at serving time on a plate lined with a paper towel or napkin.

      Title: Molly's Fat Free Marshmallow Treats
 Categories: Favorites, Candies, Low-fat
      Yield: 24 sevings
 
     10 oz Marshmallows
      4 c  Crispy rice cereal
 
      3   T Molly McButter Natural Butter
  :         Flavor Sprinkles
      1   c  raisins -- optional
  
  Pre-measure the ingredients. Melt marshmallows over low heat or microwave
  on HIGH 2-3 minutes until smooth. Remove from heat.  Add Molly McButter
  Sprinkles.  Mix well. Add cereal, stir in quickly until well coated. Press
  mixture evenly into 13 x 9 x 2 inch pan coated with cooking spray. Cool.
  Cut into squares.
  
  My notes:
  
  I put the marshmallows in a plastic bowl about 3 times their volume,
  thinking this would work.  NOT.  The marshmallows puff up unbelievably as
  they melt.  Fortunately, I have a glass tray in the bottom of my
  microwave, or I'd still be scraping and cleaning.  The marshmallows puff
  up about =6= times their volume so plan accordingly.
  
  Probably because there's no fat in this recipe, it cools very, very fast -
  far faster than regular Rice Krispies squares.  There really isn't time to
  mix the sprinkles in =well=.  You have to really work fast.  I thought I
  was working fast enough, but the mixture hardened before I got it all into
  the pan.  I ended up with a thickish circle in the center of the pan which
  I pressed down to a circle covering maybe 1/2 of the pan.  I didn't add
  the raisins, and if you do, add them immediately with the cereal.  Also,
  cut it into squares while it is still somewhat warm.  It's almost
  impossible to cut when it cools completely.
  
  All in all, it's worth it.  It tastes like the real thing, just a bit
  chewier. Next time, I will probably try it with marshmallow creme to see
  if it makes it a little softter - and work really, really, really fast. :)

      Title: Nonfat Cheesecake 'ice Cream'
 Categories: Ice cream, Dessert, Low-fat
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      8 oz FF Cream cheese; softened
    3/4 c  Sugar
      4 oz FF egg product; thawed if
           -frozen (do NOT use
           -raw eggs)
      2 ts Fresh lemon juice
    1/2 ts Vanilla
      1 c  FF evaporated milk
      1 c  FF Vanilla yogurt
 
  Here's is one I adapted from a recipe in the Krups "La Glacier" manual.  Of
  course it's not 'Dryers' (30% butterfat!) ice cream, but is really very
  tasty.
  DH said it was 'very good', and he doesn't like frozen yogurt! Shoulda seen
  the look on his face when I told him what was in it. :D
  
  The flavor could be varied with fruit, Hershey's chocolate syrup, etc.,
  but I
  would not suggested leaving out the lemon juice (it 'cuts' the canned milk
  taste) or the cream cheese (improves texture in the finished product).
  This
  was tested in a Krups "La Glacier" machine, with which I've been very
  pleased
  (about $70 at Williams Sonoma).
  
  Beat cream cheese and sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed until
  smooth.  Beat in egg product, lemon juice and vanilla until combined.
  Stir in fat-free evaporated milk and fat-free vanilla yogurt.  Freeze in
  ice cream machine according to manufacturer's directions.

      Title: Orzo and Portabello Mushrooms
 Categories: Side dish, Low-fat, Vegetable
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2    Portabello mushrooms
      1 c  (before cooking) orzo
      4 oz Sundried tomatoes
      4    Cloves minced garlic (or to
           Taste)
      2 tb Capers (or to taste--this
           Recipe is pretty loose it
           Is
           All to taste, really)
    1/2 ts Each of thyme, marjoram, and
           Oregano
      1 c  White wine
        x  Salt and crushed red pepper
           To taste
 
  you can make this in under 30 minutes if you do it all at once. so put the
  water on to boil for the orzo, and put the sundried tomatoes in a bowl with
  about a cup of water to reconstitute (rinse them off first as you will use
  the soaking water later). wash the portabellos and cut off the stems. put
  caps in a dish and sprinkle with the three herbs, then pour the cup of wine
  over them to marinate. coarsely chop the mushroom stems, mince the garlic.
  in a nonstick pan, sautee the garlic and mushroom stems in a little tomato
  water or wine. drain tomatoes, reserving the liquid, and chop coarsely
  (it's okay if they are not fully softened at this point) and sautee. the
  water should be boiling now so put the orzo on to cook. scoot the
  tomato/garlic/chopped mushroom mixture to the edges of the pan and place
  mushroom caps in the middle. pour the tomato water over them, cover, and
  simmer until the mushrooms are finished, about 12 minutes (same time as it
  takes the orzo to cook--hey!). remove the mushroom caps to a plate (to two
  plates I mean) and pour the leftover marinating wine into the pan, and add
  capers. cook and stir until reduced. drain orzo and toss with the mixture,
  and serve with the mushroom caps. yum! (I was bad and garnished this with
  toasted pine nuts and it was great, but I am eating nutless leftovers now
  and it is still really good). sorry my recipes are always so rambling.

  Thaw spinach, drain and squeeze until fairly dry. Stir dry soup mix before
  measuring, to ensure that it is evenly mixed. Mix all ingredients together
  when spinach is ready. Chill and serve with raw vegetables. For an unusual
  serving dish, slice top offa round loaf of unsliced sourdough bread and
  hollow out inside. Fill with cold dip. Save insides to use for bread
  crumbs, or cube and use for dipping. Makes 4 cups
  The recipe seems to have left out cooking the spinach which would probably

  it in well.  Dissolve cornstarch in 1/4 cup apple juice. Set aside.
  
    Preheat heavy 10-inch skillet, preferably non-stick, over high heat to
  350 degrees for about 4 minutes.  Place 4 chicken breasts in skillet. Lower
  heat to medium.  Brown for at least 1 minute per side. Remove chicken.
  Brown 4 more.  Set all the chicken aside.
  
    Return heat to high.  Stir in 1/2 cup stock, scraping bottom of skillet
  to clear it of all browned bits.  Add onions and remaining seasoning mix.
  Stir.  Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until all liquid evaporates. Stir in 1/4
  of lemon juice.  Scrape bottom of skillet again to clear it. Cook for 3 to
  4 minutes, or until liquid evaporates. Add 1/2 cup apple juice. Clear
  bottom and side of skillet. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until about half of
  the liquid evaporates.
  
    Stir in remaining 1 cup of stock, the 1/4 cup lemon juice and the 1/4 cup
  apple juice.  Bring to a boil (will take 2 to 3 minutes), whisk in the
  cornstarch-apple juice mixture, and return to a boil. Return the chicken to
  the skillet, lower the heat to medium, and cook until the chicken is done
  all the way through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Turn off the heat, remove the
  chicken, and if desired, whisk in the artificial sweetener.
  
    Makes 4 servings.

    1/4 c  Sliced scallion, white part
           -only (2 large scallions)
    1/4 c  Lime juice
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
 
   Pick over and rinse the beans. Put into a large bowl and cover completely
  w/cold water. Let soak overnight or at least 8 hrs. Drain beans and put
  into lg. pot. Add 3 cups water and bring to boil over med. heat. Cook for 5
  min. Stir in onion, garlic, oregano, bay leaf. Reduce heat to low and
  simmer uncovered about 1 hr till beans are tender. Add the chili powder,
  cumin, coriander, red pepper flakes and tomato juice, stirring to mix.
   Continue to cook while preparing the rice. Put rice and chicken stock in
  med. pan. Bring to boil over med-high heat. Cover, reduce heat to low,
  simmer 45 min. or until tender. In the meantime, combine all the salsa
  ingred- ients in a small bowl & set aside for flavors to meld. When rice is
  done, stir into bean mixture. Ladle into bowls & serve w/salsa on the side.
  
   I made this w/o all the spicy ingredients. Just used extra garlic (as
  usual!), oregano, basil and subbed tomato sauce for the juice because I
  didn't have any in the house. It was delicious. I also added a chopped
  large red tomato to the beans. I used 2 cans of beans, too. Fast and easy!

      Title: Seafood Lasagna
 Categories: Lasagna, Seafood, Low-fat
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 c  Low-fat milk powder
  2 3/4 c  Water (see note)
           Paprika to taste
           Nutmeg to taste
           Salt to taste
           Pepper to taste
    1/3 c  Tbs dry vermouth
    1/4 c  AP flour
           Olive oil; (see note)
      8 oz Scallops
      2 cl Garlic, minced
      8 oz Cooked crab meat
      9    Lasagna noodles; cooked and
           -drained (see note)
      1 ts Dill
    1/4 c  Freshly grated Parmigiana
           -(Reggiano preferabley)
 
  Preheat oven to 350 deg.
  
  Using a medium saucepan mix the milk with the water and heat over medium
  heat.  Sprinkle with enough paprika to make the sauce pale pink; add
  nutmeg and salt to taste.  Mix the vermouth and flour together in a small
  bowl to make a smooth paste.  Whisk this into the milk, stirring
  constantly, until the sauce thickens, and then set it aside.  Heat a
  non-stick skillet and coat with a non-stick vegetable oil spray.  Add
  scallops and garlic, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook until the
  scallops just turn solid white.  Remove from the skillet and combine with
  the crab.
  
  Spread a little of the white sauce in a 7 X 11 baking dish, and top with 3
  of the noodles.  Add more sauce and 1/2 the scallops and crab, and
  sprinkle with 1/2 the dill and pepper to taste.  Repeat with another layer
  of pasta, sauce and seafood, add another layer of pasta, sauce and then
  sprinkle with Parmigiana.  Bake at 350 degrees for 20 - 30 minutes, or
  until center is hot.
  
  NOTES: If you can find a no-cook lasagna noodle, such as DeFino Brand, you
  can save cooking time and some calories as well.  I don't use any oil
  sprays. Rather I drip a few drops of oil onto a clean paper towel and wipe
  it over the pan.  You probably don't need to use a non-stick pan if you
  have a well seasoned skillet.
  
  When making the sauce, I used some fish stock to mix with the milk powder
  and white wine instead of vermouth to mix the flour.  I didn't make the
  lasagna, but rather made the sauce and used it over some fresh fettucini.
  Added some pepper and finely minced leeks to the sauce also, skipped the
  dill.  The sauce was creamy enough for my taste that I used no cheese at
  all.  This sauce will work on vegetables, fish, pasta, etc.  Use your
  imagination . . . it really is good!
  
  The calorie count for this recipe is 290 per serving or 270 per serving if
  you're using the DeFino lasagna noodles. 22 gr. protein; 39 gr.

      Title: Smoky Tomato-Lentil Soup with Ham
 Categories: Low-fat, Soup/stew
      Yield: 8 servings
 
    3/4 ts Olive oil
  1 1/2 ea Onions
  1 1/2 ea Garlic cloves, crushed
  3 1/2 c  Chicken stock
      1 c  Water
    1/2 lb Ham hocks
    1/3 c  Lentils
    3/4 tb Basil
    1/2 ts Oregano
    1/2 ts Thyme
    1/8 ts Black pepper
   1/16 ts Red pepper flakes
     14 oz Plum tomatoes
    3/4 c  Cabbage, shredded
    1/8 lb Ham
 
  In a 5-6 qt pot, heat oil over medium heat.  Chop onions.  Add onions and
  garlic and saute for about 7 minutes, or until onions are soft. Rinse and
  drain lentils. Add stock, water, ham hocks, lentils, and spices. Bring to a
  boil over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat to low, and simmer, covered, for
  about 45 minutes, or until the lentils are soft. Skim fat from soup.
  Discard ham hocks.  Coarsely chop undrained tomatoes. Dice ham. Add
  tomatoes and their juice, cabbage, and ham and simmer, uncovered, for 15
  minutes, or until the cabbage is tender. Salt and pepper to taste. (The
  soup may be prepared up to 3 days ahead and refrigerated or frozen for up
  to 2 weeks.  Thaw in the refrigerator. Reheat over medium heat, stirring
  frequently, about 30 minutes.)

  Sylvia's comments: I didn't have smoked ham hocks, so just added the
  chopped ham early in the cooking.  This was a nice, flavorful soup. Could
  have used a few more lentils, or maybe some added barley, though.

      1 c  Yogurt cheese
      2 oz Smoked salmon; or turkey
      1 tb Minced fresh parsley
      1 tb Green onions; minced
 
  Line colander with double layer of cheesecloth or other suitable filter; I
  use a porous cloth napkin.  (Sylvia's note: I've lined the colander with a
  double layer of coffee filters.)  Place colander over large bowl to catch
  dripping whey.  Spoon yogurt into colander. Cover loosely with plastic wrap
  and refrigerate 6-24 hours.  The longer the refrigeration time, the thicker
  the resulting cheese. Discard whey or use in soups and casseroles. (Whey
  contains significant amounts of calcium and potassium.) 32 oz yogurt (must
  not contain gelatin) makes about 2 c cheese.
  
  Blend all ingredients well.

      Title: Spiced Apple Pudding
 Categories: Diabetic, Dessert, Low-fat
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  Unsweetened apple juice;
    1/3 c  Cornstarch;
      1    Egg; (or 2 yolks)
    1/3 c  Granulated sugar substitute;
    1/2 ts Cinnamon;
 
  MY NOTE:  This recipe is marked in the allergy category only because
  it is a pudding without milk, also low in protein. It is one of my
  favorite ways to use up egg yolks or prepare a dessert when I've run
  out of milk. Probably does not require as much sweetening as stated
  in the recipe - start with 2 Tbsp. sweetener and add more if
  necessary. Cost to make the whole recipe is around $1.22.
  
  In a heavy saucepan, combine 1/2 cup apple juice and cornstarch; mix
  well. Add remaining juice.  Place over medium heat and cook,
  stirring, until mixture comes to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for
  2 minutes. Remove from heat.
  
  In a bowl, beat egg with a fork.  Add 1/2 cup of hot mixture to
  beaten egg. Stir until smooth.  Return immediately to hot mixture,
  stirring constantly. (The hot mixture will cook the egg.)
  
  Stir in sweetener and cinnamon.  Pour into 4 dessert dishes, cover
  with plastic wrap to prevent skin from forming.  Cool to room
  temperature or chill in refrigerator.

  If you prefer to use real sugar, mix 2 TBSP with the apple juice in
  the saucepan.  Divide the cooked pudding into 6 small dishes so that
  there is approx. 1 tsp sugar per serving if you are allowed this much
  on your meal plan.  94 calories, 21 grams carbohydrate estimated.

  high and turn down to low for 2-3 hours.
  
  If cooking on stove, heat until hot and flavors are blended.
  
  Serve with Jalapeno corn bread and a salad.
  
  Sylvia's comments: What a great quick soup!  I sauteed the onions in a
  little oil first, since I don't like raw onions in food, then stirred in
  the taco seasoning and then the rest of the ingredients.  I didn't know
  whether to drain the stuff or not, so I drained and rinsed everything
  except the tomatoes.  The original recipe didn't have toppings, but it just
  seemed to need something.  Sour cream or shredded cheddar set it off very
  nicely, and I think corn tortillas would as well but I didn't have them to
  try.

      2 ts Sugar
      1    Bay leaf
    1/2 ts Dried thyme, crumbled
    1/4 ts Dried rubbed sage

      2 T  Dried currants
      2 ts Long grain white rice

    1/2 ts Orange peel; minced (orange
           -part only)
           Fresh sage leaves (opt.)
           Orange peel strips (opt.)
 
  This recipe for Turkey Scallopine was taken from Bon Appetit Feb. 93. It
  is called a low salt recipe but it is also low in fat, a double bonus. I
  was leery of the claim that this recipe would work for me, as I am a
  confirmed fat addict; I couldn't tell the difference!!
  
  Combine leeks, 1/3 cup chicken stock, sugar, bay leaf, dried thyme and
  dried sage in heavy large skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and
  cook over low heat until leeks are very tender, stirring occasionally,
  about 25 minutes. Uncover and cook until golden brown and liquid
  evaporates, stirring frequently, about 8 minutes. Discard bay leaf. (Can
  be prepared to this point one day ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Rewarm
  before using.)
  
  Combine 1/3 cup Marsala and currants in bowl. Let stand 30 minutes. Place
  remaining 1 2/3 cup chicken stock in heavy small saucepan. Strain Marsala
  from currants into stock; reserve currants. Bring stock mixture to boil.
  Add white rice, reduce heat, cover and simmer until rice is very tender,
  about 30 minutes. Drain rice; reserve stock mixture. Transfer rice and 1/4
  cup stock mixture to blender and puree. Add remaining stock mixture to
  blender and puree until stock is smooth.
  
  Heat heavy large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Season turkey
  with salt and pepper. Add turkey to skillet and saute utnil cooked through
  and golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer turkey to plate; tent
  with foil to keep warm. Add sauce, currants, remaining 1 T marsala and
  minced orange peel to same skillet and bring to boil. Cook until sauce
  thickens, about 2 minutes. Spoon leek mixture onto plates. Top with
  turkey. Spoon sauce over. Garnish with fresh sage leaves and orange peel
  strips if desired and serve immediately.
  
  ** Note: When I did the initial step of cooking the leeks, I found that
  the leeks were tender and the liquid almost evaporated in about 1/2 of the
  time that the recipe states, so keep a watch that your expensive leeks do
  not burn up on you!
  
  This recipe is from the "No Salt, No Sugar, No Fat Cookbook."  I've not
  made this myself, since I'm not a big fan of cheesecake, but I've made and
  posted other recipes from this book, and the results have been quite good.

  the process until all pieces are breaded. Spray the chicken lightly with

  hour, turning the pieces every 20 minutes to allow even browning. Serve hot

      Title: White Bean and Vegetable Gratin
 Categories: Entree, Vegetarian, Casseroles, Bean, Low-fat
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 lb Dried Navy Beans
      2 ts Olive oil
      1    Onion
      8    Garlic cloves
      2 c  Tomatoes, fresh plum
     10 oz Spinach
      1 tb Lemon rind, grated
      2 tb Red wine vinegar
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Black pepper, ground
      1 c  Bread crumbs, fresh
    1/2 lb Low-fat Swiss cheese
      1 tb Butter
 
  Sort and rinse beans and put in a 5 quart saucepan with enough water to
  cover by 2 inches.  Bring to a boil, boil 2 minutes, remove from heat and
  let stand 1 hour.
  
  Chop onion, mince garlic, chop tomatoes, chop spinach, and grate lemon
  rind.
  
  Drain soaking water from beans and add fresh water to cover by 2 inches.
  Bring to boil over high heat, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer,
  covered, for one hour until beans are tender.  Drain beans, reserving 1 cup
  bean liquid (freeze the remainder to add to your next batch of vegetable
  soup).
  
  Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, heat oil over medium heat.  Add onion a nd
  saute 5 minutes.  Add garlic and saute 1 minute.  Remove from heat and
  transfer to a large bowl; add tomatoes, spinach, lemon rind, vinegar, salt,
  pepper, and half the beans.
  
  Put fresh bread and cheese (cut in chunks) in food processor and process
  until small crumbs. Set aside.
  
  In food processor fitted with chopping blade, combine remaining half of
  beans and reserved cooking liquid.  Process until mixture is a smooth
  puree.  Stir puree into vegetable mixture in bowl, mixing until well
  combined.
  
  Heat oven to 350 F. Spray a 9 x 13 pan with butter-flavored spray.  Spread
  vegetable-bean mixture in pan and top with bread crumb/cheese mixture. Cut
  better into small bits and dot top of mixture.  Bake 30 to 35 minutes or
  until top is golden brown.  Cool 10 minutes before serving.
  
  Serve with crusty bread.
  
  Using canned white beans and canned S&W Redi-cut tomatoes (drained) would
  make this much faster to prepare, or this would be a good candidate for
  multiple-recipe cooking and freezing.  If freezing, package crumb mixture
  seperately for adding after dish has thawed but before baking.
