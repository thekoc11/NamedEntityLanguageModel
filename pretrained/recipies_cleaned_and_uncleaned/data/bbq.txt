Barbacoa Mexicana (Barbecue From Mexico City)

mexican, lamb

1  lamb, cut into pieces *
1 maguey leaves
1 ingredients for barbecue consomme

* backbone, legs, shoulders, ribs, and head

To further explore the international links of various cuisines, check
out this one and remember a few months back when we were talking abou
the Pacific Island custom of cooking in pits. I didn't realize that
the Mexicans also had such a practice.  Here's a series of recipes
revolving around Mexican Barbacoa or barbecue.

To be very authentic, use a lamb which has been slaughtered the day
before the cookout and hung overnight. On the day of the big event,
the animal is split into sections:  backbone, legs, shoulders, ribs,
and head.

METHOD:

We assume that no one would tackle this kind of barbecue without a
large number of guests-the kind who really like to pitch in. So, the
first thing to do is to set one group of your guests to digging a
hole about four feet by two feet across.  Other members of the party
can scout up kindling and others can be set to work cleaning each
maguey leaf.

Once the hole is dug, it is plastered with mud to keep the walls firm.
Large porous stones should then be placed in the bottom of the pit
(beware of little hard rocks; they'll split open). Over the stones
put enough dry wood to fill the pit, then set fire to the wood and
let it burn to the smokeless coal stage. While the fire is burning
down, the maguey leaves should be toasted until limp, for this will
enable them to release precious juices needed to season the meat.

When the fire has burned down sufficiently, line the pit with the
maguey leaves, making sure that all of the mud is covered so meat
will not stick to pit.  The leaves should be suspended vertically,
the tips overlapping all the way around and held down with stones for
the moment.

The next step is to lower a grate into the hole and on it place the
casserole with soup ingredients.  On top of the uncovered casserole
ingredients, arrange the lamb pieces, starting with the backbone,
then the legs, shoulders, rib sections, and the head.  Do not salt
meat before it is cooked, for this can toughen it.

After meat is in the pit, fold the tips of the maguey leaves into the
hole to cover the meat well.  Over this place a metal sheet to keep
any earth from seeping into the pit and then seal the pit with a coat
of fresh mud and build a large fire over the metal sheet and mud
cover.

Keep the fire blazing for 5 or 6 hours, depending upon the age of the
meat. Open the pit, salt the meat before serving it, and accompany it
with Salsa Borracha*.   The broth is served in small cups.

*  See Shepherd's Roast with Drunken Sauce for recipe.

1 large onion; chopped
1 can (8 ounce) tomato sauce
1 large egg
1 tablespoon my seasoning (follows)
1 medium green pepper; chopped
      ----SAUCE----
1/2 cup water
3 tablespoon vinegar
3 tablespoon brown sugar
2 tablespoon prepared mustard
1 1/2 cup tomato sauce
2 tablespoon butter

My favorite meatloaf recipe.

Combine the beef, bread crumbs, onion, 8 ounce tomato sauce, egg, My
Seasoning, and green pepper.  Mix well and place in a loaf pan.

Combine all sauce ingredients.  Cook in a saucepan until butter
melts. Pour sauce over meat loaf and bake at 350F^. for 1 hour. While
baking, the sauce needs to be spooned over the meat occasionally.

Note: Make sure you use a pan large enough for the meat and sauce, or
the sauce will tend to boil over while it is cooking.

My Seasoning: Mix 1 part garlic powder, 1 part onion powder, 1/2 part
black pepper. Mix well before measuring and adding to the recipe.

Combine salt, sugar, cumin, pepper, chili powder and paprika to make

ribs, coat with Basting Sauce just before removing from grill. Otherwise
serve dry with sauce on side. Remove ribs from grill, cut in between bones
and serve. Makes 5 servings.

BARBEQUED RIBS~ MISSOURI-STYLE

pork, bbq, ham

2 tablespoon salt
1/4 cup sugar
2 tablespoon cumin, ground
2 tablespoon pepper, black, fresh ground
2 tablespoon chili powder
4 tablespoon paprika
2 each racks of 3/down pork ribs**
      ----BASTING SAUCE----
1 3/4 cup vinegar, white
2 tablespoon hot pepper sauce
2 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon pepper, black, fresh ground

The term "3/down" refers to the weight of the ribs. In this case, it
is three pounds or less for each slab of 10 to 12 ribs.

Combine salt, sugar, cumin, pepper, chili powder and paprika to make
barbecue rub.  Rub ribs thoroughly with this mixture. Place ribs on
baking sheets and cook in 180 degree oven for 3 hours. Do not turn;
solow cooking infuses spices.

Remove from oven.  (ribs may now be covered and refrigerated up to 2
days before grilling)

Use very low charcoal fire with rack set as high as possible. Grill
ribs 5 minutes to 30 minutes per side, depending on heat and
temperature of ribs. Ribs should have light outer crust and be heated
throughout.

If you prefer juicy ribs, coat with basting sauce just before
removing from grill.  Otherwise serve dry with sauce on side. Remove
ribs from grill, cut in between bones and serve.

Note:  Recipe is easily halved or doubled.  Keep 2:1 proportion of
sauce to rub.

larger flap (sirloin) can be grilled. The smaller one is excellent to
use for kebabs. If you're cooking for a larger group, use the entire
leg.

and line jellyroll pan with aluminum foil.

2. Combine garlic, rosemary, oil, vinegar, mustard and salt in a small
bowl. Rub over entire surface of lamb. (Can be done as long as 12
hours ahead of time, if desired.)

ground pepper. Grill or bake until it registers 120 degrees on an
instant reading thermometer for rare, 22 to 25 minutes; or longer as
desired. Let rest for 5 minutes before slicing.

Cook Boston pork butt all day, or until it is so tender it falls apart

meat with two forks.  Return meat to crockpot and add a bottle of
your favorite barbecue sauce (I like KC Masterpiece, or Kraft Honey

BERT'S SUPERB BARBECUE SAUCE (TMFR24A)

sauces, bbq

1/4 cup cider vinegar
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon prepared mustard
1/4 cup butter or margarine
1 thick lemon slice
1  onion; sliced
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 1/2 tablespoon salt
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3/4 cup heinz catsup
2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

In a saucepan, mix vinegar, water, sugar, mustard, butter, lemon,
onion, and seasonings. Simmer, uncovered, 20 minutes. Add
Worcestershire sauce and catsup, bring back to a boil and its done.
(Good Housekeeping CB, 1955) NOTE: I do not use cayenne or salt and
always double this recipe. Into the double recipe, I add about 1/4 to
1/3 cup brown sugar. This gives the sauce more of a sweet and sour
taste. It is just excellent on Baby Back Ribs, which I simmer in
water with a little vinegar, garlic and just a pinch of salt for
about 30 minutes before barbequeing. Through trial and error, I have
found that Heinz catchup is thicker and makes a "clingier" sauce.

Cha Shu (Barbecued Pork Strips)

pork, bbq

2 pound boneless pork butt
      ----MARINADE----
2 tablespoon chicken stock
2 tablespoon dark soy sauce
1 tablespoon soybean condiment
1  (mein see*)
1  lrg. clove garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon chinese rice wine or dry sherry
1 1/2 tablespoon honey
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon hoisin sauce
1  few drops of red food coloring

Cut the pork into long strips 1 1/2 to 2 inches square. Mix all for
the marinade and marinate the meat for 3 hrs., unrefrigerated, or 6
hrs. in the refrigerator.  Turn the strips every hour or so.

Preheat the oven to 350^.  Place a large cake pan half filled with
water on the lowest shelf of your oven. This will catch drips from
the meat and prevent smoking. Place the meat strips directly on an
oven rack and put in the top position of the oven. Be sure that all
of the meat is over the dripping pan. Roast for 45 minutes without
disturbing the meat. Then, turn the heat up to 450^ and roast for an
additional 15 minutes or until the pork strips are crisp and a rich
brown color. Slice the meat and serve it hot or cold... or use in
other dishes as directed.

*Mein See:  The remains of the process of making soy sauce. Very rich
soybean condiment used in many Chinese dishes. Can be found in
Oriental markets under this name or soybean jam or condiment.
Refrigerate after opening.

Cha Siu Bow (Steamed Barbecued Pork Buns)

pork, ham, chinese

      ----FILLING----
4 cup barbecued pork; dice fine
1/2 cup dehydrated onion flakes
      ----SAUCE MIXTURE----
2 teaspoon hoisin sauce
2 teaspoon sherry
4 teaspoon oyster sauce
2 teaspoon catsup
1 teaspoon sugar
1 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
1 1/2 cup chicken stock

*Recipe is included in this collection. TO MAKE FILLING: Soak onion
flakes in a cup with just enough water to cover flakes. Mix sauce in
a small sauce pan.
Cook over medium high heat until sauce thickens. Stir in the diced
pork and onion flakes. Chill 3-4 hours.
WRAPPING: Divide filling into 24 portions. Divide dough into 24
balls. Slightly flatten each ball then roll out into 4-inch discs,
leaving the center of the disc twice as thick as the side. Place 1
portion of the filling in the center of the dough. Gather up the
sides around the filling and twist dough to seal.
Place on a 2 inch square piece of wax paper, twist side down. Put the
wrapped buns at least 2 inches apart on a cookie sheet and allow the
buns to rise in a draft-free place (the oven) for another hour.
STEAMING: Steam for 15 minutes. Turn heat off and let the steam
subside before lifting the cover. BAKING: Cha Siu Bow can also be
baked. Preheat oven at 350 degrees. Set buns 2 inches apart on cookie
sheet.
Brush with a mixture of 1 beaten egg white, 1 teaspoon.
water and 1/4 teaspoon. sugar. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden
brown. Brush with melted butter. DO AHEAD NOTES: Cook and freeze.
Reheat by steaming if steam-cooked originally. Steam frozen buns for
1/2 hour to reheat. If baked, thaw and wrap buns in foil or cover pan
with foil and reheat in slow oven for 1/2 hour.

COMMENTS: A good filling should have some pork fat mixed in with the
lean meat. Most importantly, Cha Siu Bow filling should be very
juicy. That's why Ms. Yee uses so much liquid in the sauce mixture.
By chilling the filling thoroughly, the sauce, which is very thick,
adheres to the filling much better. Ideally, when you make the
barbecued pork, you should try to save the pork drippings and use
them as part of the sauce mixture. Ms. Yee deliberately leaves the
center of the dough a bit thick because, if you roll it out to an
even thickness, the top of the bun will ended up being too thin in
comparison to the bottom due to of the way the dough is wrapped. In a
pinch, you may use frozen bread dough as a substitute. However,
frozen dough works best when baked. It does not steam well.

Prepare bread dough. Cut out twenty 3-inch squares of parchment
paper. Mix together ginger, oyster sauce, hoisin, dark soy, sugar and
water in a bowl.

Heat a wok over medium-high heat. Add oil. When hot, add onion;
stir-fry until soft. Don't brown. Add pork and stir-fry 30 seconds.
Pour in sauce mixture, bring to a boil. Stir cornstarch/water into a
smooth mixture. Add to pork; cook, stirring until thick, about 15
seconds. Add sesame oil. Remove to bowl; refrigerate until thoroughly
chilled.

Cut dough in half. Form each half into a 12-inch long log; cut into 10
pieces. Roll each piece into a 4-inch circle. Roll outer inch of each
circle 1/8-inch thin; leave middle slightly thicker.

If right-handed, place a dough circle in palm of your left hand. Put
a big tablespoon of pork mixture in the ; middle; put left thumb over
the pork. With your right hand, bring up edge and make a pleat in it.
Rotate circle a little and make a second pleat. As you make each
pleat, gently pull it up and around as if to enclose your thumb.
Continue rotating, pleating and pinching, then gently twist into a
spiral. Pinch to seal. Place bun pleated side down on a parchment
square. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Put buns 1 1/2
inches apart on a baking sheet. Let rise until doubled in size, 30
minutes to 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Beat egg yolks with water and sugar;
brush over buns. Bake 20 minutes.

Makes 20 buns.

CHINESE BAKED SWEET BREAD DOUGH

Chinese bread dough is quite sweet compared with Western breads (the
further south you go in China, the sweeter the dough becomes). Most
Chinese breads are steamed, which is why they look pale and uncooked
to the Western eye.

Put the yeast and 1 tablespoon of the sugar in a small bowl. Add 1/4
cup of the warm milk. Let stand 5 minutes, then stir to dissolve. If
should foam and bubble. If it does not, discard and use a fresh
package of yeast. Stir in the egg, oil and remaining milk.

Put the flour and remaining sugar in the work bowl of a food processor
fitted with the metal blade. Process 2 seconds. With the machine
running, pour the warm milk mixture down the feed tube in a steady
stream. Process until it forms a rough ball. If ball is sticky and
wet, add a little more flour. Process a few seconds longer, or until
dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Remove dough to a
lightly floured board.

Knead dough, dusting with flour to keep it from sticking, until
smooth and elastic, about 2 minutes. Place in a large oiled bowl,
cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm spot until doubled,
about 1 hour.

Punch down dough and place on a lightly floured surface. It is now
ready to form into rolls, buns or loaves.

Makes enough for 20 barbecued pork buns. Joyce Jue, San Francisco

Chao Tom (Barbecued Shrimp Paste On Sugar Can

pork, ham, condiments, venison

1 tablespoon roasted rice powder
1  scallion oil
1  crisp-fried shallots
1 tablespoon roasted peanuts, ground
1 pound raw shrimp in the shell
1 tablespoon salt
6  garlic cloves, crushed
6  shallots, crushed
2  ounces rock sugar, crushed to a pow; der, or
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
4  ounces pork fat
4 teaspoon nuoc mam
1  freshly ground black pepper
1  peanut sauce
1  vegetable platter
8  ounces 6 1/2-inch rice paper rounds; (banh trang)
12  piece fresh sugar cane, or
12 ounce sugar cane packed in light syrup, d; rained
12  8-1/2 ea inch bamboo skewers soaked; in water for 30 minutes
1  vegetable oil, for shaping shrimp p; aste
8  ounces extra-thin rice vermicelli

The allied recipes for this rather complex operation follow in the
next post. Although this dish can be baked in an oven, I strongly
suggest you grill it over charcoal, for the result is far superior.
The dish may be prepared over 2 consecutive days.  On day one,
prepare the dipping sauce and condiments.  The Vegetable Platter and
shrimp paste can be assembled the following day. Fresh sugar cane may
be obtained at Caribbean markets; canned sugar cane is available at
Asian grocery stores. Prepare the roasted rice powder, scallion oil,
crisp-fried shallots and roasted peanuts. Set aside. Shell and devein
the shrimp. Sprinkle the salt over the shrimp and let stand for 20
minutes. Rinse the shrimp thoroughly with cold water. Drain and
squeeze between your hands to remove excess water. Dry thoroughly
with paper towels.  Coarsely chop the shrimp. Boil the pork fat for
10 minutes. Drain and finely dice. In a food processor, combine the
shrimp, garlic, shallots and sugar. Process until the shrimp paste
pulls away from the sides of the container, stopping as necessary to
scrape down the sides. The paste should be very fine and sticky. Add
the pork fat, roasted rice powder, fish sauce and black pepper to
taste to the processor. Pulse briefly, only enough to blend all of
the ingredients. Cover and refrigerate. Meanwhile, prepare the Peanut
Sauce and Vegetable Platter. Cover the rice papers with a damp towel
and a sheet of plastic wrap; keep at room temperature until needed.
Peel the fresh sugar cane; cut crosswise into 4-inch sections. Split
each section lengthwise into quarters. (if using canned sugar cane,
split each section lengthwise in half only, then thread 2 pieces
lengthwise onto a skewer.) Pour about 1/4 cup of oil into a small
bowl. Oil your fingers. Pick up and mold about 2 tablespoons of the
shrimp paste around and halfway down a piece of fresh sugar cane.
Leave about 1 1/2 inches of the sugar cane exposed to serve as a
handle. (If using canned sugar cane, there is no need to leave a
handle. The skewers will serve as handles.) Press firmly so that the
paste adheres to the cane. Proceed until you have used all the shrimp
paste. Prepare a charcoal grill or preheat the oven to broil.
Meanwhile, steam the noodles, then garnish with the scallion oil,
crisp-fried shallots and ground roasted peanuts. Keep warm.  Pour the
peanut sauce into individual bowls and place the Vegetable Platter
and rice papers on the table. Grill the shrimp paste on the sugar
cane over medium coals, turning frequently. Or Broil, on a baking
sheet lined with foil, under the broiler, about 6 inches from the
heat, for 3 minutes on each side, or until browned. Transfer to a
warm platter. To serve, each diner dips a rice paper round in a bowl
of warm water to make it pliable, then places the paper on a dinner
plate. Different ingredients from the Vegetable Platter, some noodles
and a piece of the shrimp paste, which has been removed from the
sugar cane, are added. The rice paper is then roiled up to form a
neat package. The roll is dipped in the Peanut Sauce and eaten out of
hand. The remaining sugar cane may be chewed. Note: If both types of
sugar cane are unavailable, use skewers. Shape the shrimp paste into
meatballs and thread 3 or 4 on each skewer. Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

Chinese Bbq Pork

pork, chinese

2 pound boneless pork shoulder, cut into 8x; 2-1/2x1/2 pieces
      ----MARINADE----
5 teaspoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
2  garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon ginger juice
4 tablespoon ketchup
4 tablespoon soy sauce
5 teaspoon white wine
1 teaspoon five spice powder
      ----BASTING SAUCE----
1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
1/4 cup honey

Marinate pork for 2-4 hours, or overnight if you wish. Preheat oven
to 375F and place marinated pork on a rack over a roasting pan filled
with 1 cup of water. Bake for 20 minutes, basting occasionally with
remaining marinade. Turn and bake another 20 minutes.

Take pan out of oven, swich oven to broil.  Baste both sides of pork
with basting sauce and broil for 1 minute on each side.

Let pork cool and cut into thin slices.  Serve hot or cold. Keep in
tightly sealed container in refrigerator or in freezer if not served
right away. Reheat with a little water in roasting pan, or wrap in
foil.

Notes:  Let the meat marinade at least 8 hours - you will get a much
more tender result.  Make extra, it's really good... We serve it cold
on a plate with pickled ginger and green onion flowers as a starter
to a Chinese meal. Or add it to 'La Choy' frozen wonton soup along
with some green onion, and slivered vegetables for a 'homemade' look.

Chinese-Style Barbecued Pork

meats, chinese

1/4 cup shao xing
1/3 cup soy sauce
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon ginger, fresh; grated
1  garlic clove; minced
2 1/2 pound boneless pork rib end roast
1/3 cup catsup
1 tablespoon mustard, dry
2 teaspoon ; water

Combine the sherry, soy sauce, sugar, ginger and garlic, blending
well. Place the pork roast in a dish or plastic bag, add the sauce,
and brush over the meat or close the bag tightly and turn to coat the
meat with the sauce.  Marinate at room temperature 2 to 3 hours or in
the refrigerator overnight.

This cut of pork is best cooked on a grill with a cover or on a spit.
If you do not have a spit or grill with a cover, shape a loose tent
of foil over the meat to hold in the heat and help prevent flare-ups
while cooking.

Remove the meat from the marinade, reserving the marinade, and place
on a grill 6 to 8 inches above a drip pan surrounded by hot coals or
with the coals pushed to the back of the grill. Brush the meat with
the sauce and grill 1 hour, basting and turning as needed to cook
evenly and prevent flare-ups.  Test with a meat thermometer. When the
internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F. the meat is thoroughly
cooked but still tender and juicy.  A thick roast might require 30
minutes longer.

Just before the meat is done, mix the catsup into the remaining
marinade and brush over the meat.  Turn and glaze the meat over the
drip pan. Remove the meat to a serving plater, cover loosely with
foil and let stand 30 minutes.  About 10 minutes before serving, mix
the dry mustard to a smooth thin paste with the water. Slice the pork
roast thinly and serve the catsup sauce and mustard sauce separately,
or swirl the mustard into the catsup sauce.

"I was a young woman in Miami when I first had what my date called
Chinese roast pork with hot and heavenly sauce. This is my
adaptation, after I learned that the restauranteur's 'hot and
heavenly' is American catsup and mustard."

Classic Barbecued Spareribs

appetizers, pork, chinese

2 pound spareribs, in one piece
1  (have the butcher trim the
1  fat and discard the
1  breastbone)
4 cup plum sauce
      ----MARINADE----
4 tablespoon chicken broth
1/4 cup soy sauce
3 tablespoon honey or corn syrup
3 tablespoon hoisin sauce
2 tablespoon wine vinegar
2 tablespoon dry sherry or
1  shaoshing wine
1 teaspoon sugar
2 centiliter (medium) garlic,
1  chopped fine
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 pinch (tiny) 5-spice powder
1  (optional)
      ----DIPPING SAUCE----
1  plum sauce
1  scallion, chopped

Preheat the oven 10 375 degree F. Trim any excess fat from the ribs
and place them in a long shallow dish. In a mixing bowl, combine the
marinade ingredients; if you are using 5-spice powder, add it to the
mixture by putting it through a tea strainer so it spreads out over
the mixture. Mix well, and pour over the ribs and leave for 3 hours
at room temperature or about 6 hours in the refrigerator. Baste the
ribs every hours or so, turning them over. TO ROAST THE RIBS: Remove
the ribs from the marinade. Add the 1/4 cup plum sauce to the
marinade; reserve it for basting. Hook metal drapery hooks through
both ends of each rack of ribs, at the top, and hang each one as if
you were hanging a hammock, suspended from the bars of one of the
oven racks. Set the oven rack in the highest position in the oven. On
the floor of the oven or on another oven rack set at the lowest
position in the oven, place a baking pan half filled with water, to
collect drippings and prevent smoking. You may want to line the
baking pan with aluminum foil before putting the water in, to make it
easier to clean. Roast the spareribs for 45 minutes in the preheated
oven. Then baste them with the reserved basting sauce, using a small
pastery brush and carefully pulling out the oven rack to facilitate
the basting process. Turn the oven up to 450 degrees F and roast for
another 15 minutes. By this time the spareribs should be a rich
golden brown with crisp edges. Baste again, then take them out of the
oven. Place the ribs on a cutting board and remove the drapery hooks.
Separate the individual ribs with a cleaver or sharp knife. Serve at
room temperature, with dipping sauce. Makes 6 to 8 appetizer
servings. NOTE: You will need about 12 drapery hooks. Recipe:

This sauce is brushed on the chicken before cooking and served at the
table in small containers to dip the chicken pieces in.

Pour cups of water and tomato juice into 1 1/2 qt saucepan. Add
bouillon cube, paprika, sugar, salt, basil, parsley, poultry
seasoning, thyme, ginger, mustard, onion powder, bay leaf,
Worcestershire sauce and Tabasco. Stir well or whisk to mix. Bring to
a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes. Remove bay leaf. Stir
in lemon juice.

Mix cornstarch and 1 Tbsp water to smooth paste. Add to mixture and
cook, stirring constantly, about 2 minutes until sauce thickens.

Crockpot-Barbeque Beef Or Pork

meats, beef, crockpot, bbq

      ----JONI'S KITCHEN----
4 pound to 6 pound beef or pork or a combin; on of both.
2 pkg onion soup mix
2  12 ounce bot's chili sauce
1/2 cup brown sugar:more or less
1/4 cup black molasses'; about
2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce; or less water;to cover me

In Crockpot on High, place cut up pieces of Beef and pork if you want
to combine them, or just one or the other. I use what ever beef is on
sale trim as much fat off as I can. Cut in large chunks put in Crock
with 1 to 2 packages of onion soup mix. I usually use a good 4 to 6
pound roast we like to freeze it. Use enough water to cover. You can add
additional onions and celery to give it more flavor. And cook until
fork tender. Remove from Crock, put meat on platter to cool, and save
a couple of cups of the juice it was cooked in. Put into the crockpot
the Chili Sauce, brown sugar, Molasses(optional) Worcestershire to
taste. I do not like it too hot so I don't use more than a couple of
tablespoons. Now take your meat on a board and start to shred it with
a fork and paring knife, how ever it is easy for you, I don't like it
to fine so do not use my processor. Just cut in pieces and shred, OK.
Now put it back in crock and add enough of the juice it was cooked
in, with the onions from the mix also, it adds to the flavor.Add just
enough juice to make it moist, save some of the juice for as it cooks
on simmer you may have to add some more. If you use for a cookout,
you can keep it plugged in, and keep a check for moistness, when it
gets a little dry just add some more juice. I use hamburger rolls. or
bakery Hamburger rolls, or Kaiser rolls. What ever you prefer. It
goes a long way. Left over's I put in little freezer bags or in the
margarine containers,1/2 pound size, and freeze. Just enough for two
sandwich's for lunch. This is from memory, so if you have a question
or doubt<G> ask away. From Joni's Kitchen For Diabetics' I take a
small portion and just add everything but the sugar and use Twin
Brown sugar. Does very well.

Cruibins (Grilled Pigs' Trotters~ Irish Style

meats

4 each brined pigs' trotters
2 single carrots
1 single stick celery
1 single onion
6 fl ounce wine vinegar
1 single melted butter
1 single dried breadcrumbs
1 pinch allspice

Get plain pig's trotters from your butcher and then brine them for 24
hours. Once they've been brined long enough, bandage them with several
strips of cheesecloth, or tie them several times around the short way
with string, since they will try with all their might to fall apart
into many pieces while cooking. Put into a pot with the vegetables,
and cover with water and the vinegar. Simmer gently for 6 or 7 hours.
Allow to cool in the liquid. -- To serve, split the trotter in two
the long way and roll in melted butter and dried breadcrumbs mixed
with a pinch of allspice. Heat slowly under a broiler, or in the oven
at 350 F, until hot and crisp on the outside. Serve with mustard and
horseradish for those who like such things....and LOTS of wet wipes
and paper towels. . Basic brine for trotters: . 12 1/2 cups water:
3/4 pound sea salt: 3/4 pound brown sugar: 2 ounce saltpeter (optional):  1
teaspoon
juniper berries: small piece ungrated nutmeg: 1 bay leaf:  3 sprigs
thyme: 1 teaspoon black peppercorns: 4 cloves. Put all ingredients in a
pan,
bring to boiling point, skim and remove from the heat.  Let cool.
Add trotters, weight down with a very clean stone or other
nonreactive weight, and leave for 24 hours. (The spices are also
optional if you're in too much of a hurry.)

Diane's N.C. Barbeque Sauce

meats, sauces

2 quart water
1 1/2 cup brown sugar
1 1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 cup yellow mustard (french's)
1 quart ketchup
1/2 cup freshly cracked black peppe
1/2 cup dry red pepper flakes
1 quart white wine (white zinfandel
3 quart red wine vinegar
1 1/2 cup salt

Add all ingredients together in a very large pot, bring to a boil, and
simmer for 30 min.

This recipe came from the Frugal Gourmet's tablespoon.V. show, but don't
let
that turn you off! We've tried other recipes, but this is the one
that we like the best. As far as I'm concerned, this is the best
tasting barbecue sauce around. We've made 3 batches already, so this is a
tried recipe, rather than one we've only read about. It makes about 2
gal. We haven't tried any smaller batches since we use it a lot. For
the meat, we use fresh pork shoulders and roast them at 350F for
approx. 4 hours. The pork is coated with Kosher salt only, no other
spices. After the meat is cooked and cooled slightly, it is hand
pulled apart. This is hard to describe. You want to end up with
stringy meat rather than chunks. I've also seen chunky barbecue where the
meat is cut from the shoulder, but I like the "pulled" better. We
then add the barbecue sauce to the pork and package it for the freezer. It
freezes well. Our normal batch will be approx. 2 pork shoulders,
about 7-8 pounds. each. We usually wait for the meat to be on sale to
make this. We keep the left over sauce in the refrigerator. You have
enough sauce for about 4 batches or approx. 60 pounds. It sounds like a
lot, but if you like barbecue, it goes quickly.

Eastern N. Carolina Minced Pork Barbecue

meats, pork, bbq

9 pound pork, preferably trimmed
1  half shoulders, in about 3
1  chunks
      ----BRINE----
      ----SAUCE----
      ----DIRECTIONS----

1 c  Good wine or cider vinegar 1 c Water 1 teaspoon Freshly ground black
pepper
1/4 teaspoon  Ground red pepper 1 ea Bay leaf, crumbled 1 teaspoon Rosemary
twigs 3 tablespoon Raw
turbinado sugar, brown -sugar, honey or molasses 2 tablespoon Salt 1/2 c
Catsup 1/2
c Canned crushed tomatoes 1/2 c Good wine or cider vinegar 2 tablespoon Raw
turbinado sugar, brown -sugar, honey or molasses 1 ea Or 2 fresh chilies,
seeds -and membranes optionally ~removed, -OR- Dried whole or crushed red
~chilies 1 ea Clove garlic, crushed 1 tablespoon Soy sauce 1 teaspoon Dried
thyme, oregano,
or -sage 1/2 c Sliced onions Stir the Brine ingredients to dissolve. Rinse
and wash the pork in running water. Immerse the pork chunks in brine poured
into heavy plastic bags. Force the air from the bags and seal. Marinate the
pork for 12 to 18 hours in the refrigerator, turning twice. The meat should
"cure" to a light gray and become firm. Smoking: Prepare electric smoke
oven with at least a quart of water and a good handful of wook chips or
twigs. Use hardwoods or fruitwoods in the chip tray. Soak them to prolong
the smoke. Spray racks with vegetable cooking spray. Place pork on racks
without piercing with a fork.  Smoke the meat at a bare sizzling
temperature (175 degrees F) for 4 to  4 1/2 hours. Replenish the water pan
or chip tray if necessary. Remove pork and disconnect smoker. Allow the
meat to cool for half an hour. Trim the meat of skin and fat, and remove
the meat from bones. Using a large knife or cleaver, slice, dice and mince
the meat.  The meat should still be slightly pink, even when fully cooked.
This is a characteristic of smoke ovens. (The cooking is not completed yet,
however.) Simmer the sauce ingredients gently for 1 hour or until slightly
thickened. Allow it to cook, stirring occasionally. Blend the minced pork
with the sauce, reserving 1/2 cup of sauce for the table. Pack into
casserole dishes, cover, and heat in a 200F oven for 1 hour. Uncover, stir,
and serve. EnjoyIngredients:

Place the roast, garlic, and onion in a crock pot on high. Add the
salt and pepper and a little bit of water. Cook on high until you can
easily shred the pork roast with a fork. I would cook this in my
crock pot (Rival) for about 5 hours. Remove the roast and shred the
meat removing as much of the fat as possible and the bone. Strain the
grease in the crock pot, keeping any bits of garlic and onion left
and throwing out the grease. Place the shredded meat back into the
crock pot, along with the bits of garlic and onion. Pour the barbecue
sauce over all until the meat is covered. Mix well. Continue cooking
the pork in the crock pot for about three hours, on low. Serve the
barbecue pork on Kaiser rolls, onion rolls, pocketbook buns or any
speciality hamburger bun. Very Good.

Easy Grill Roasted Prime Rib

beef, grill

1 each 12 to 15 pound capless prime
1  rib (aka export rib) bone in
1 cup kosher salt
1 cup coarse cracked black pepper

Rub the prime rib all over with salt and pepper.

In a large kettle grill, start a fire well over to one side. When the
coals are well lit, place the rib on the grill grid on the side
opposite the coals, being careful that no part of the rib is directly
over the coals. Put the lid on the kettle with the vents 1/4 open.
Cook for approximately 2 hours, adding a handful of fresh charcoal
every 30 minutes or so.

At the 2-hour point, check the rib with a meat thermometer to
determine doneness; remove from the fire at 118 F for very rare, 122
F for rare, 126 for medium rare, and so on, adding 4 F for each
degree of doneness. Allow to rest for 30 minutes before slicing.

4 slice bread; crumbled
2 cup baked beans
2  eggs; or substitute
1 cup barbecue sauce
1/4 cup mustard
1/4 cup ketchup
2 cup potatoes; mashed
1 cup cheese

This is another one of those recipes I made up by combining 3 or 4
other recipes, or parts of them anyway. And of course a couple of
things added just off the top of my head. It is YUMMY!

:          Mash up the baked beans.  Mix everything together except
the potatoes and the cheese.  Add more liquid or bread as needed to
reach desired consistancy.
:          Press mixture into the bottom and around sides of two 9x5"
loaf pans, leaving a large trough in the center.  Reserve about 1-1/2
cups of mixture to cover top with.
:          Fill troughs of each meatloaf with mashed potatoes.  Cut
cheese into cubes, or grate, and put this on top of the potatoes.
Cover potatoes and cheese with reserved meat mixture.
:          Bake for 1 hour at 350 degrees.

Grilled Beef Tenderloin With Red Wine & Pistachios

main dish, beef, herbs

2 cup beef or veal stock
2 cup dry red wine - preferably pinot noi; r
1/2 cup roasted garlic cloves
1/2 cup chopped shallots
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 dash each salt and pepper - or to taste
1/4 cup toasted pistachios; chopped
1/4 cup toasted sunflower seeds - chopped
2 pound beef tenderloin - cut in 8 ounce. s; ks
2 tablespoon olive oil or corn oil
      ----GARNISH----
4  fresh parsley sprigs

Preheat grill or broiler.

To make Red Wine Sauce:  In a large saucepan, combine the stock, red
wine, 3 tb. of the roasted garlic, shallots and 1/4 cup of chopped
parsley. Bring to a simmer over medium heat; cook until reduced to
coat the back of a spoon, about 20 minutes.  Transfer to a blender;
puree until smooth. Strain through a fine sieve into another
saucepan, then adjust the salt and pepper.  Stir in the remaining
parsley; reduce heat to low.

In a small bowl, combine the remaining garlic, pistachios, sunflower
seeds and 2 tb. of the Red Wine Sauce. Mix well. Rub the surface of
the steaks with the oil.

Grill steaks until well-seared on the surface, about 5 minutes. Turn
over and cook until you reach desired doneness, about 4 minutes for
medium-rare, depending on the thickness.

Brush tops of steaks with a small amount of Red Wine Sauce, then
press the steaks, top side down, into the pistachio mixture, coating
the surface well.  Position the steaks on serving plates, spoon the
remaining sauce around them, garnish with parsley sprigs and serve.

Note:  The nut garnish/topping can be added to the sauce, just before
adjusting the salt and pepper.

1 cup olive oil
2  lemons, juiced
1/3 cup tomato paste
2 teaspoon rosemary
1/2 teaspoon black pepper, ground coarse
1/2 teaspoon marjoram
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon savory

Have the butcher butterfly the leg of lamb, or do it yourself.

two hours at room temperature, or overnight in the refrigerator. Check
occasionally to make sure that it is still coated with the marinade and
re-cover as necessary.

minutes on each side, brushing occasionally with the marinade. Serve sliced
thin (hot) with the rest of the marinade, heated.

itself, is excellent for any type of lamb. Yield: Serves 6-8.

*  This also makes wonderful sandwiches if there are any leftovers.

Grilled Country Ribs From George Fassett

meats

      ----MARINATING SAUCE----
1 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup white vinegar
4  eggs
1 tablespoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
3/4 teaspoon bell's seasoning
1 tablespoon parsley flakes
1/4 teaspoon oregano
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
      ----FOILED POTATOES----
5 medium potatoes
1/4  stick of butter
1/2 teaspoon parsley
1  clove garlic, chopped
1 small onion, halved and sl
1  salt and pepper to tas
1  veg. shortening

Marinating the Ribs:

Place country pork rib slices in a large container, such as a
tupperware-type with a tight-fitting lid, add all ingredients for
marinade. Cover and shake vigorously to mix. Refrigerate, overnight
best but a few hours at the least.  This is an adaptation to the
class "Fireman's Field Days" marinade.

Preparing the potatoes:

Spread out two 3 ft. sheets of heavy duty aluminum foil, splic
together to form one wide one.  Rub vegetable shortening on center
2/3 of foil to prevent sticking. Slice potatoes, skin still on, onto
foil food processor works wonders..).  Season potato slices with
remainder ingredients, slice butter over top.
Carefully draw sides of foil together and crimp (don't pull apart
seam on bottom!) and then roll up ends.

Cooking:

Get grill hot, place foil potatoes over high heat and cook for to 20
min., then move to low-heat area, upper shelf, or keep warm in oven.
(Check potatoes by unrolling top a bit and they should be soft,
bottom layer browned well.)

Keeping grill hot, lay out pork slices from marinade and grill Adjust
temp for flaming/burning, not letting them fire or char. Turn baste,
letting marinade cook on top of meat before turning again. The egg
congeals on the hot surface of the ribs and helps to coat the ribs
Continue turning and basting every few minutes until all marinade is
g approx. 30-40 minutes. Cut into thickest part of a slice and check
fo doneness - there should be no pink.  The object of turning and
basting to build up a coating of the cooked marinade on the meat,
almost like crust. Meat will have a well-cooked appearance but should
not be char black (don't let flames ignite marinade and burn it).

Serve foil potatoes hot from foil (mmm, get the crispy ones on
bottom, like potato chips!) and dive into the ribs. Add your favorite
vegetable or corn on the cob for a great meal, any time of the year!

steak, slice it across the grain about 1/4" thick and wrap in foil to
keep warm. Place a quadriple layer thick aluminum foil on the grill
with a little olive oil. Grill the vegetables quickly. To make it
authenic, place a cast iron skillet on the grill first and when the
vegetables are done, carefully place it all in the skillet and
carefully serve on a heavy trivet.

Grilled Fillet With Mushroom Sauce

main dish, meats

1  beef fillet; about 4 1/2
1  pounds
1/2 cup red wine
1/4 cup oil
1/4 cup onion; minced
1 tablespoon herbes de provence or other
1  herb blend
      ----MUSHROOM SAUCE----
2 tablespoon butter or margarine
2 tablespoon onion; minced
2  cloves garlic; minced
8 ounce fresh mushrooms; cleaned
1  and sliced
1 teaspoon meat glaze (bovril); or
1 teaspoon broth seasoning mix
1  reserved marinade for fillet
1  red wine or beef broth; if
1  needed

Buy a prime grade fillet, if possible, and trim it well. Fold and tie
the tail to the meat to form a roast of uniform thickness (or have
the butcher do it for you). Place the meat in a plastic bag. Mix the
wine, oil, onion, and herbs, blending well.  Pour over the meat,
close the bag tightly, and turn it to coat the meat with the
marinade. Place the bag in a dish and marinate the meat for 2 hours
at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator.  Drain the
meat, reserving the marinade. Grill the meat 4 inches above hot
coals, turning to brown on all sides. This takes about 10 minutes of
undivided attention so you can put out any flash fires. Add damp
hickory chips or small hickory sticks. Move the meat to the edge of
the grill or cover the grill and cook for 15 to 20 minutes longer for
rare, 20 to 25 minutes for medium rare. Slice and serve with the
mushroom sauce.

MUSHROOM SAUCE:

In a medium skillet, melt the butter and add the onion and garlic,
cooking until the onion is tender but not browned. Add the mushrooms
and cook, stirring gently now and then, until well saturated with the
butter and most of the juices cooked from the mushrooms have
evaporated. Stir in the meat glaze.  Add the reserved marinade and,
if needed, a few tablespoons of wine or broth to make a light sauce.
Serve with the grilled fillet.

cooks. Turn once half-way through cooking time. Prepare garnish sauce by
browning shallots in butter and stirring in the white wine and rosemary.

Grilled Loin Of Pork With Tart Cherry Sauce

pork

4 pound boneless pork loin roast, fat trimm; ed
1  salt
1  pepper
1 cup dry red wine
1/2 cup orange juice
3 tablespoon chopped shallots or onions
1  clove garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon minced ginger root
1/8 teaspoon ground allspice
1/8 teaspoon pepper
3 tablespoon cornstarch
1/3 cup cold water
1 pound fresh or frozen cherries
1/4  to 1/3 cup nutrasweet spoonful

Dunno how you feel about NutriSweet and such ilk, but I'm posting a
bunch of stuff from NutriSweets cookbook. Some of it looks right
good. Tart cherries in a red wine sauce are the perfect complement to
roast pork, while they give a dinnertime favorite new taste appeal.

Lightly sprinkle the roast with salt and pepper; place on rack in
roasting pan.  Insert meat thermometer so tip is in center of meat.
Roast at 325F until thermometer registers 170F, about 2 hours.

Heat the wine, orange juice, shallots, garlic, ginger root, allspice
and 1/8 teaspoon pepper to boiling in medium saucepan; reduce heat to
low and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes.

Heat to boiling once more.  Mix cornstarch and cold water; stir into
boiling mixture.  Boil, stirring constantly, until thickened. Stir in
cherries; cook over low heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat;
cool for 2 to 3 minutes.  Stir in NutraSweet Spoonful. Slice pork and
arrange on platter; serve with Cherry Sauce.

NOTE:  Tart Cherry Sauce is also excellent served with venison or
other game.

Grilled Marinated Skirt Steak

main dish, meats

1/2 cup cumin seeds
4  jalapeno peppers, halved and seeded
3  cloves garlic
4 teaspoon cracked black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup lime juice (from about 4 limes)
2 cup coarsely chopped cilantro leaves an; d stems
1 cup olive oil
3 pound skirt steak, trimmed of excess fat; and cut into 6 pieces
1  avocado corn relish
12  flour tortillas, heated

1. In a small, heavy frying pan, toast the cumin seeds over
moderately high heat, shaking the pan, until fragrant, about 30
seconds. Transfer the cumin seeds to a blender.

2. Add the jalapenos, garlic, black pepper and salt to the blender and
puree with the lime juice until the cumin seeds are finely ground.
Then add the cilantro and oil and puree until smooth.

3. Rub the meat all over with some of the marinade and roll each
piece into a cylinder. Arrange the meat in a shallow glass dish or
stainless-steel pan. Pour the remaining marinade over the meat. Cover
and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours. About 30 minutes
before cooking, remove the meat from the refrigerator and unroll each
steak.

4. Light the grill or heat the broiler. Grill or broil the steaks for
3 minutes. Turn the meat and cook to your taste, about 3 to 4 minutes
longer for medium-rare. Transfer to a carving board and let rest in a
warm spot for 5 minutes. Slice the steaks across the grain and on the
diagonal. The slices should be about 1/4 inch thick. Serve with the
Avocado Corn Relish and warm flour tortillas.

Look for a robust red wine that won't be overwhelmed by the strong
Southwestern flavors of this marinated steak with its spicy relish.
Try a recent bottling of garnacha from Spain.

Grilled Merguez With Cilantro-Lime Relish

meats

1  stephen ceideburg
1 1/2 pound merguez sausage, separated into lin; ks
1 cup coarsely chopped cilantro
2  limes, juice only
2  garlic cloves, chopped

The article says merguez is a spicy North African lamb sausage and
that it is available in Middle Eastern markets. She doesn't offer a
substitute, but I'd think chorizo or hot links might work alongside
the other dishes.

Grill sausages, turning several times to cook evenly, until they are
slightly charred on the outside, still juicy on the inside.

Meanwhile, combine cilantro, lime juice and garlic.

Serve hot merguez with cilantro-lime relish on the side.

Grilled Pizza With Two Toppings

bbq, pizza

      ----DOUGH----
1 cup warm water (105-115 degrees)
1 pkg active dry yeast
1 pinch granulated sugar
1/4 cup fine-ground white cornmeal
3 tablespoon whole wheat flour
2 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
2 1/2 cup unbleached flour (to 3 1/2c)
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
      ----TOPPING #1----
3 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoon grated bel paese cheese
3 tablespoon tomato sauce (to 4 tb)
1  red pepper, seeded/julienned
5  thin slices prosciutto
      ----TOPPING #2----
1  clove garlic, minced
2 tablespoon grated bel paese cheese
4 tablespoon tomato sauce
2 ounce fresh mozzarella *
1  fresh jalapeno pepper **
2 tablespoon calmata olives pitted/sliced

* sliced 1/8-inch thick

** seeded and chopped

PREPARE THE DOUGH: Place warm water in a small bowl, add yeast and
sugar, stir until dissolved; set aside for 5 minutes. Add cornmeal,
whole wheat flour and salt, beat to combine. Gradually add white
flour, stirring with a wooden spoon until dough is stiff. Transfer
dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic.

Brush dough on all sides with olive oil and place in an oiled bowl.
Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise until double in bulk, about
1 hour. Punch dough down; if dough is sticky, knead in a small amount
of flour. Makes enough dough for four 12-inch pizzas.

BASIC GRILLING INSTRUCTIONS: Prepare a charcoal fire. When coals are
medium-hot, flatten pizza dough on an oiled surface to form a 10-12
inch round that is about 1/8-inch thick. Gently lift dough and drape
over grill surface just above the coals. Within a minute the dough
will cook and brown. As soon as the underside is crisp and grill
marks appear, pull the dough off the grill with tongs and flip over
to the edge of the grill, away from direct heat. Quickly brush cooked
surface with olive oil, add toppings...

TOPPING #1: PARMESAN, PEPPER, AND PROSCIUTTO Evenly distribute
Parmesan and Bel Paese cheeses over surface of grilled and oiled
pizza dough. Spoon tomato sauce over cheese. Scatter red pepper and
prosciutto over sauce. Continue with final grilling instructions...

TOPPING #2: TOMATO, OLIVE, JALAPENO AND MOZZARELLA TOPPING Evenly
distribute garlic on grilled and oiled pizza dough. Sprinkle with
cheese and spoon tomato sauce evenly over surface. Cover surface with
mozzarella slices and scatter jalapeno peppers over surface. Continue
with final grilling instructions...

FINAL GRILLING INSTRUCTIONS Drizzle surface of pizza with 1-2
tablespoons olive oil. Slide pizza back toward source of heat. Rotate
frequently with tongs until underside is brown and topping is bubbly
hot. Serve at once.

4 tablespoon olive oil
1  juice of 1 lemon
3  cloves garlic; crushed

Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over
high heat.  Remove the tournedos from the marinade and reserve it.
With a paper towel, wipe or blot the tournedos and add them to the
pan. Cook them to the preferred degree of doneness (about 8 minutes

Grilling Steaks **

beef, grill, info

      ----PATTI  VDRJ67A----

1). Prepare the meat by triming the border of fat to a thickness of
1/4". Slash fat at 1" intervals to prevent curling during cooking.
2). If desired, marinate the meat for one hour or more to tenderize
and flavor it. Flavor increases with longer marinating. 3). Season
the meat with pepper, garlic or herbs before placing it on the grill.
Add salt after grilling because it will draw juices from meat during
grilling. 4). Place steak on gas grill over medium heat or on
charcoal grill over medium-high coals. Cook to desired doneness,
using cooking times listed below. For a juicier steak, turn meat only
once and do not pierce with a fork.

1/4 cup harbor village chef's barbecue mari
1 1/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon salt
2 teaspoon mui gwe lo rice wine
1/3 cup light soy sauce
1 teaspoon five-spice powder
1 cup water (for roasting pan)
1  glazing sauce
      ----barbecue MARINADE----
2/3 cup cooking oil
8  garlic cloves, peeled and minced
1 3/4 cup hoisin sauce
1 3/4 cup ground bean sauce
1 1/4 cup sugar
1/2 cup nam yu (red bean curd cheese)
1/2 cup sesame seed paste
      ----GLAZING SAUCE----
17 1/2 ounce container of maltose sugar
1/4 cup hot water
2 teaspoon mui gwe lo rice wine

Ran across this in the SF paper the other day and, on reading the
ingredients, knew immediately that this is one for you. In the
article that accompanied the recipe the author talks about a Chinese
barbecue oven that the chef who originated this recipe uses.  It's made
out of stainless steel, five feet tall with a 180,000 BTU burner in
it! This is something I really need for my kitchen. This looks like a
full-on, no- nonsense Chinese barbecue.

Most master chefs seldom reveal all their kitchen secrets, but Derun
Yu shared this recipe for a barbecued pork marinade, adapted for the
home oven. Armed with a Chinese rice bowl, he assembled the
ingredients, then poured them into a scale so we would have precise
measurements.

Versatile Chinese barbecued pork is the "ham" of Chinese cooking. It
may be sliced and served as an appetizer or entree, or like a
sandwich, cubed and stuffed in bread dough and steamed into pork
buns. It's good stir- fried with vegetables, tossed with noodles or
cooked with scrambled eggs.

Prepare the marinade:  Heat the oil in a wok or saucepan over
medium-high heat.  Add the garlic and gently fry just until it floats
to the surface and is golden brown (about 2 minutes). Quickly remove
the garlic and discard.  Pour the garlic oil into a large mixing
bowl, let cool.

Stir in remaining ingredients with the garlic oil into a smooth
sauce. Pour into a glass jar. cool.  If the marinade is covered with
1/8 inch cooking oil, it will keep in the refrigerator for several
months.

Yields 5 cups.

Then combine the sugar, salt, rice wine, soy sauce, Barbecue Marinade
and five-spice powder in a large mixing bowl; mix well. Add the pork
butt and marinate for about 30 minutes (when using spareribs,
marinate for 1 hour).

Preheat oven to 500F.  Pour the water into a 10 X 14-inch roasting
pan. Place the roasting rack in the pan (the rack should not touch
the water). Remove the meat slices from the marinade and place on the
rack; reserve the marinade.  Roast for 8 minutes, turn over and roast
the other side for 8 minutes longer.  Reduce the oven temperature to
300F. Brush the pork with the reserved marinade; roast for an
additional 20 minutes on each side. Remove from the oven and let cool
for 5 minutes.

Slice the pork butt into 1/4-inch slices.

Prepare the glazing sauce:  To soften maltose sugar, place the
container (uncovered) in a microwave oven at high setting for 1
minute. Transfer the softened maltose into a double boiler with the
water and rice wine; stir until the glaze is well mixed.  Keep the
sauce warm until ready to use.

Makes 2 cups.

Then spoon a few tablespoons of the glaze over pork before serving.
NOTE: Hoisin sauce, ground bean sauce, nam yu, maltose sugar and
sesame seed paste are available in Chinese markets.

Honey Barbecued Chicken

bbq

1  basting sauce:
6 tablespoon honey, 8 tb if necessary
3 tablespoon tarragon or white wine
1  vinegar
1 teaspoon curry powder
1 teaspoon dried tarragon
2 single chickens, each 3 pounds
1  salt and pepper

In bowl, combine honey, vinegar, curry powder and tarragon. Remove
grids from barbecue. Place one or two shallow drip pans - filled with
water or stock (you can also add a splash of white wine on the lava
rocks. Preheat barbecue to high setting. Arrange chickens on spit,
making sure they are evenly balanced. Brush with honey basting sauce
and install rotisserie on barbecue with drip pans directly
underneath. Barbecue at high setting for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to
medium and roast chickens, with lid down, for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours,
basting every 30 minutes with sauce, until thermometer inserted in
thickest part of thigh registers 185'F. Remove from barbecue, season
with salt and pepper, and tent with foil. Let stand 10 minutes
before   carving. Serves six to eight. INDIRECT COOKING METHOD FOR
GAS BARBECUES WITH TWO BURNERS: Place a shallow metal or foil pan
(not necessary to add water)  under one side of grill to catch
drippings. Preheat both sides of barbecue on high setting. Tie wings
and legs of chicken with string; brush lightly with oil. Place
chicken breast-side down on hot grill and cook for two minutes. Turn
chichen on its side and grill for two minutes. (A long-handled spoon
inserted in cavity makes it easy to turn). Turn on back and grill for
two minutes; continue to grill chicken on other side for two minutes
until browned all over. Place chicken, breast-side up, on the side of
barbecue with drip pan underneath; turn off burner on that side.
Brush liberally with sauce and roast chicken with lid down for about
90 minutes, brushing occasionally with sauce, until chicken is done.
(Indirect heat from other side of barbecue will cook the chicken).
This method also works well with beef, pork, or lamb roasts. IF YOU
HAVE A CHARCOAL BARBECUE WITH A LID: Move the hot coals to the sides
of barbecue and place a drip pan in centre. Place chichen or roast on
grill with drip pan dirctly underneath. Cook with lid down and use a
meat thermometer to gauge when foods are cooked.

Jeff's Favorite Barbecue Brisket

main dish, meats, bbq

6 pound beef brisket
1  smoker for cooking
10 pound charcoal
1/4 pound mesquite wood
1  basting sauce
1  barbecue sauce

This is a perfect way to spend a day, and makes a meal fit for a king!

It really takes a smoker to make this successfully, but creative folks can
use whatever's handy.

Select a good quality beef brisket.  Trim off excess fat and store in
refrigerator until ready to barbecue.

If you wish, marinade the meat for additional flavor or tenderness. A good
marinade can consist of water, Worcestershire Sauce, Soy Sauce, pepper,
lime or lemon juice - whatever you like!  (No Salt, though)

Start 8 pounds. of the charcoal and allow coals to develop gray ash over
all
before beginning to cook.  Reserve the remaining 2 pounds. for adding when
needed later.  Add wood that has been soaking in water for an hour or so.

Cook the meat on a grate approx. 8 inches over the coals, adding charcoal
and wood to fire as needed.  It isn't necessary to keep a heavy smoke at
all times, just 1/2 of the cooking time.  Use a meat thermometer to
determine doneness of meat to your preference.  If the smoker has an
indicator for temperature, a low heat is fine.  Coals and wood tend to burn
at lower temperatures when enclosed in a smoker.

While cooking, it is essential to baste often with the basting sauce.
Usually every 10 minutes or even less will ensure a juicy and delicious
brisket.

If basting with another sauce, remember that anything containing sugar or
tomato will burn, leaving a scorched flavor.  That's especially true with
meats cooked over long periods of time.

Serve with the warmed barbecue sauce and breads, beans, salad or
potatoes.

Enjoy!    Jeff Duke

4 tablespoon butter
1/2 teaspoon onion powder

Saute mushrooms in 1/2 stick of butter. Mix ground beef with spices
thoroughly. Fashion into thin patties (1/4"); 5 inches in diameter as
they will shrink and get "thicker" after grilling. Grill until
desired doneness. Garnish with mushrooms, tomatoes, SHARP Cheddar
cheese and lettuce. Serve on an Onion roll. Purple onion slices are
optional for those who enjoy that sweet onion. Hamburgers tend to get
a little boring but this will change your mind about the traditional
burger. NOTE: This is not a "HOT" burger, so stay with the spices. It
is a little extra trouble with all the ingredients but it is relished
by my family. Hope yours enjoy it too. Joey Aguzin in New Awlins.

Korean Barbecue - Bulgogi

beef, korean, bbq

2 pound lean beef tenderloin
1/2 cup light soy sauce
1/4 cup dark soy sauce
1/2 cup water
3 tablespoon finely chopped green onion
3 teaspoon crushed garlic
2 teaspoon finely minced fresh ginger
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon white sesame seeds, toasted  and gr; ound
1 tablespoon sesame oil

Bulgogi or Bulgalbi, broiled (grilled) beef strips and
beef ribs respectively, exemplify an age-old tradition
of cooking on a curved iron hotplate - a tradition
that is matched in northern China and neighboring
Mongolia as introduced by the Manchurians.  Today this
has been streamlined for table service, with specially
built cone-shaped hotplates fitted over tabletop
burners, to provide an enjoyable and intimate eating
experience. Meats of all kinds, including mutton, pork
and poultry, offal and seafood, are cooked in this
way, being first marinated in a spicy mixture
encompassing the characteristic seasonings: soy sauce,
sesame oil, garlic, ginger, pepper or chili, toasted
sesame seeds and green onions. The meat is marinated
well in advance so that the flavor is intense. Cooking
time is minimal - just enough to cook through and seal
the surface. Serve Bulgogi with white rice and
yangnyum kanjang sauce, together with a selection of
accompaniments such as kim chee (chili pickled
cabbage) and jeot khal (spiced whitefish).

in beef and coat well. Cover and marinate at room
temperature for 2  hours or   overnight   in   the

cooking. Add sugar and marinate another 30 minutes.
Stir fry in hot oil using a large skillet or wok over
medium heat until light brown, 2 to 3 minutes, do not
crowd the pan. Serve with hot cooked rice.  Yield 4
servings. Note: Flavor is improved if the beef is
cooked on a barbecue grill that has rods close enough
together so the meat will not fall through. 'BULKOKEE'
is Korea's national dish and may have been the
inspiration for Japan's teriyaki, which it resembles.
In Korea, the dish is usually sprinkled with toasted
sesame seeds before serving.

Korean Bbq Beef

beef, bbq

2 pound beef sirloin tips; cut into
1/2 cup soy sauce
6 tablespoon sugar
6  green onions
2  cl garlic; minced
4 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon sesame seeds

Recipe by: Anna Baird <BAIRD@WRLCVM.BITNET> Mix it all
together and marinate at least 2 hours.   Can either
cook it on the grill as kebabs or stir-fry by itself.
Enjoy.

When I don't have sirloin tips, I use flank steak and
it tastes just as goo Also, I substitute hot pepper
sesame oil and also add cayenne pepper for more kick.
The sugar allows the beef to caramelize a little (I
tried using cane sugar once but it didn't caramelize).

Korean Beef Barbecue

beverages, main dish, meats

1 1/2 pound boneless beef: cut 1 1/2
1  thick
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 cup scallions; chopped, 2 lg
2 large cloves garlic; minced
1/4 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon dry sherry
2 tablespoon vegetable oil

Freeze the meat until firm, about 2 hours.  Meanwhile,
in a heavy iron skillet, spread the sesame seeds and
toast over moderate heat until golden. Stir the seed
once or twice to toast evenly.  With a mortar and
pestle or with the back of a spoon against a board,
grind the seeds until powdery. Place in a large bowl
with the scallions, garlic to taste (if you like
garlic, up to 3 cloves may be used), soy sauce, sugar,
sherry, and vegetable oil, blending well.  With a very
sharp knife, cut the semi-frozen meat (beef chuck,
round or sirloin), across the grain, into strips about
1/4-inch thick.  Add the meat strips to the sauce,
stirring to coat well, cover, and marinate at room
temperature for 1 to 2 hours. Let the fire in a
hibachi or small grill burn down ot glowing coals. If
the grill rack is widely spaced, place the meat strips
in a hinged wire broiler. Broil about 1 minute on each
side until browned but still rare. Serve with rice and
vinegary coleslaw or cucumber salad.

Luther's Barbecued Ribs

5 pound spareribs
      ----FLORIDA BARBECUE SAUCE----
2 cup margarine or butter
1 cup cider vinegar
1 cup catsup
6 ounce jar prepared horseradish
6  limes or lemons (the juice)
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce

PREPARE FLORIDA BARBECUE SAUCE: In a medium stainless-steel or
enamelware saucepan melt margarine or butter slowly. Add vinegar,
catsup, horseradish, lime or lemon juice, salt and Worcestershire and
pepper sauces. Simmer uncovered 20 to 25 minutes to blend flavors.
Use as basting sauce for pork, chicken or other meats and serve as a
table sauce. Leftover sauce can be refrigerated and kept up to a
week. NOTE: If using this sauce for chicken, lemons are better than
limes; limes give a pleasant tang to pork and other meats.
DIRECTIONS: Place ribs about 6 inches above hot coals. Brush lightly
with sauce and brown on one side. Keep a water bottle handy when
using this sauce as it causes flames to shoot up. Turn, brush again
with sauce, and brown the other side.  Continue turning and basting
every 10 minutes until ribs are done, about 1 hour. Check by cutting
near bone in a center section.  If juices run clear or golden the
ribs are done. Remove ribs to a platter. Cut into 1- to 3-rib
sections and serve with any remaining sauce.

1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup honey
8  beef ribs, about 4 pounds

Here are a few more barbecue recipes I found in a July food supplement.
Scanning sure is great.  I'm finally making progress on my huge pile
of newspapers! I've never used the microwave for cooking ribs, but I
imagine precooking them would serve the same purpose as parboiling
them (which I don't do either...)

Combine ketchup with the vinegar, salt, chili powder, oregano, garlic,
pepper and honey.

Mix well and marinate ribs in the mixture for 20 minutes in a
microwave-safe dish.

Cover with plastic wrap and microwave at full power for 10 minutes.

Remove plastic wrap and turn ribs.

Cover with plastic wrap and microwave for an other 10 minutes.

Heat a charcoal grill until the coals are white-hot, or preheat a gas
grill on high for 5 minutes with the lid closed.

Grill the ribs about 4 inches from the hot coals. They will take
about 4 minutes per side.

Serves 4.

Mike's Bbq Sauce For Ribs

bbq

10 1/2 ounce can campbell's beef broth plus one; can water
6 ounce can tomato paste
1/2 cup worchestershire sauce
1 tablespoon liquid smoke
1/4 cup cider vinegar
1/2 cup gulden's mustard
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tablespoon chile powder
1 teaspoon habenero hot sauce

Throw  all the ingrediants into a pot, mix and bring to the point
where it just starts to boil.  I guess a very gentle simmer would be
a good term for it.  You want some of the liguid to boil off, but you
do not want to burn the sauce.  Cook uncovered until you reach the
consistency that you would like.  I'll usually cook for about 4
hours, stiring quite a bit.

If you like a thicker sauce, leave out some of the water.

If you don't like to sweat with your ribs, you might cut down on the
amount of chili powder and/or the hot sauce.

Mixed Vegetable Grill

vegetables, bbq

      ----NORMA WRENN MSN----
3/4 cup olive oil
3 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
3 tablespoon fresh cilantro; chopped
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
2  fennel bulbs; trimmed; cut in half leng
4  baby artichokes; trimmed
2  whole heads garlic; unpeeled
2  belgian endives (witloof/
1  chicory)
2  anaheim (mild green) chili
1  peppers; cut in half lengthwise; s
8 ounce whole fresh shiitake
1  mushrooms; stemmed
12  to 16 thin asparagus (12 ounce) tri; d
1 large red onion; cut crosswise into slices

Here is a suggested medley of vegetables, but improvise and use
whatever is in season and reasonably young and tender. Very firm
vegetales will grill more quickly and evenly if you first cook them
in boiling water until just tender, a step that can be done hours
ahead.

In a small bowl whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, cilantro,
salt and pepper, set aside.

In a large pot bring about 4 quarts salted water to a rapid boil.
Cook the fennel bulbs until just tender when pierced, 7-10 minutes.
Remove them and drain well; set aside. Drop in the artichokes and
cook until just tender, 5-10 minutes.  Scoop them out, drain well and
then cut them in half lengthwise; set aside. Blanch the garlic heads
for about 5 minutes; remove them, drain well and set aside.  Finally,
blanch the Belgian endives for about 1 minute; remove them, drain
well and then cut in half lengthwise. Set aside. Have th chili
peppers, mushrooms, asparagus and onion at hand also.

Prepare a fire in a grill.  Position the oiled grill rack 4-6 inches
above the fire.  Arrange the vegetables on the rack. Grill the fennel
halves, artichoke halves, whole garlic heads and onion slices for
about 12 minutes, the pepper halves and mushrooms for about 10
minutes, the endive halves for about 8 minutes, and the asparagus for
4-8 minutes, depending upon size. As the vegetables cook, turn them
two or three times and brush with the oil mixture.  Serve warm or at
room temperature.

Momma's & Daddy's Barbecue Sauce

bbq

1  #10 can
12 cup water
6 teaspoon celery salt
1  head garlic -- peeled and
1  crushed
6 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon louisiana hot sauce
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup Worcestershire sauce
6 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1  zest from the lemons
3 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1  catsup -- (about 12 cups)

Combine ingredients, stirring to blend.  Simmer for about an hour
before using or canning to allow it to thicken. Charcoal broil or
cook in a pit meat or chicken until done. Cover with sauce and keep
warm until ready to serve.  Is best if meat can marinate for at least
30 minutes before serving.

Note:  You can get pretty comparable results from a Weber grill and
mesquite chips, as Bill's Barbecue was always smoked with mequite.
Daddy always said that you had to use Lea and Perrins Worcestershire
Sauce -- other brands made the sauce taste funny. This recipe made my
parents a fine living for many years before they retired, in the
highly competitive world of Texas Barbecue. Rosilyn H. Overton

Mongolian Grill

lamb, beef, chinese

1/2 cup millet
1  lamb bones*
10 cup cold water
1  salt
1  barbecue:
2 pound boneless lamb taken from the upper; part of the leg *
2 pound boneless beef sirloin
2 cup slivered green onion (cut in half l; engthwise and slice
1  diagonally into 1/2-inch sections)
2 cup chinese parsley leaves
1  dip:
1 cup thin soy sauce
1/2 cup chinese red vinegar
1/2 cup rice wine
1/2 cup fresh ginger juice **
2 tablespoon flower pepper salt (see recipe at e; nd)
1/4 cup hot pepper oil
1/4 cup sesame oil
2 tablespoon garlic paste ***

From: Kyosho Connick This first is from The People's Republic of China
Cookbook, _Mongolian_Barbecue_ A truly native meal, typical of the
diet of the rugged Mongolian nomad. The thin-sliced meat is dipped in
a spicy sauce, quickly grilled and then wrapped in a sesame roll. A
gruel-like millet soup is eaten between sandwiches, and the meal is
topped off with draughts of heated sorghum whiskey. Transposed to the
West, this meal is ideal for an outdoor barbecue.

Millet soup:

* Ask the butcher to bone a leg of lamb.  Use the bones to make the
soup and freeze the shank portion for later use. ** Smash 5 large
slices of fresh ginger with the end of a cleaver handle and put them
in 1/2 cup water for 2 hours.  Squeeze out the juice from the ginger
slices. *** Peel and crush 4 large garlic cloves into a paste, and
add a little rice wine or vinegar to moisten.

Soak the millet overnight in cold water.  The next morning, put the
lamb bones in a large pot.  Add water and bring to a boil. Reduce the
heat and simmer for several hours, adding water to maintain the
original volume. Skim off the fat, remove the bones and strain the
stock. Drain the millet, rinse several times, add to the stock and
simmer slowly for 1 to 2 hours, or until the grains break up and the
soup is thickened. Salt to taste. Turn off the heat and set aside.
While the stock is simmering, trim off all fat and skin from the beef
and lamb. Wrap the meat well and place in the freezer for 2 to 3
hours, or until it becomes firm, but not frozen hard. (This makes it
easier to slice the meat very thinly.) Using a very sharp knife or
cleaver, carefully cut against the grain of the meat to make slices
about 1/8 inch thick.  Cut each slice into strips about 2 by 4
inches.  Arrange the beef and lamb in layers on separate platters.
Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Put the green onion and
parsley in separate bowls, cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
Put each dip ingredient in a separate bowl, place the bowls on a
large tray, cover and set aside.  Prepare the rolls.

pork roast.  It is especially good when used on outdoor barbecues.
Fourth of July at our house always offered a rotisseried pork roast,
prepared over hot coals...my father brushed the sauce on the pork as
it cooked. Extra sauce was always served on the side.

"This has been in our family for over 40 years.  My mom got it from a

her apartment hallway and knocked on the neighbor's door to get the

Nue Nam Tok: Grilled Beef With Thai Seasoning

meats, oriental

3  serrano chilies
1/4 cup white vinegar
1 1/2 pound flank steak
1/4 pound red onion; sliced
4  green onions
1/4 cup lime juice; plus:
1 tablespoon lime juice
2 tablespoon fish sauce
1 teaspoon ground roasted chilies *
2 tablespoon ground toasted rice **
1  red lettuce leaves
1  coriander sprigs
1  mint or basil leaves

1.  Remove the stems, but not the seedes, from the chilies.  Slice the
chiles crosswise into pieces 1/8" thick.  Place the sliced chiles and
vinegar in a small serving bowl.  Let it stand for at least 15 minutes.

2.  Grill the beef to the desired doneness, preferably over charcoal. Slice
it across the grain into strips 1/8" thick and 1 to 2 inches long. Put
these in a large ceramic bowl.

3.  Peel the red onion, remove the root portion, and slice the onion
vertically into thin strips.  Slice the green onion diagonally into thin
pieces.  Add both types of onion to the beef.

4.  Add the lime juice, fish sauce, ground chilies, and ground rice. Mix
well

5.  Arrange a single layer of lettuce leaves on a serving platter, and
place th beef mixture on top.  Garnish with sprigs of coriander and mint or
basil leaves.

6.  Serve at room temperature, the vinegar sauce (from Step 1) and rice.

*  Use small hot chilies about 3 to 4 inches long.  Roast whole chillie
stems and all, in a dry wok or skillet until the color changes to dark red
or brown depending on the chilies used.  Be careful not to let them burn.
When the chilies have cooled, remove the stems and seeds. Place the chilies
in a food processor or blender and grind using short pulses. Pre-ground
chilies are also commercially available, but often lack the "bite" of home
ground ones and may be more expensive.

** Place uncooked rice in a dry wok or skillet and heat over moderate heat
until deep golden brown,s tirring frequently to keep from burning and to
allow it to develop a uniform color.  Watch the rice carefully after it
begins to change colorand stir constantly because it can burn easily at
this stage.  When it is auniform deep golden color, remove from heat and
allow to cool to room temperature.  Grind it to a fine powder in a blender
or a spice grinder.  This can be made in advance and kept in quantity so
that there is always a supply on hand, but it is also easy to make up while
preparing the dish.

Pork With Rhubarb Sauce

pork, low cal

3 pound pork loin center rib roast (8 ribs)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper; coarsely ground
1/2 pound rhubarb, fresh; chopped (2 cups)
1/4 cup apple juice concentrate; thawed
2 tablespoon honey
1  nutmeg, ground
2 tablespoon ; water
1 teaspoon cornstarch

Have the butcher loosen the pork roast backbone, if possible, for
easier carving.  Rub the roast with salt and pepper. Place bone side
down in a small, shallow roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into
the thickest portion of the roast; make sure bulb doesn't touch bone,
fat, or the pan. Roast, uncovered, at 325 F. until the thermometer
reads 150 F., about 75 to 90 minutes.

For the sauce, in a medium saucepan stir together the rhubarb, apple
juice concentrate, honey, and nutmeg. Bring to a boil; reduce the
heat, cover, and simmer ten minutes or until the rhubarb is very
tender. Mix the water and cornstarch; stir into the rhubarb mixture.
Cook and stir until the sauce is thickened and bubbly. Continue
cooking for two minutes more.

When the meat thermometer registers 150 F., spoon some of the sauce
over the roast.  Continue roasting until the thermometer reads 170
F., about 30 to 45 minutes more. Spoon on additional sauce
occasionally. Let the roast stand 15 minutes before carving.  Heat
any remaining sauce and pass with the roast.

MICROWAVE DIRECTIONS: Prepare and roast the pork as directed. For the
sauce, in a 1 1/2-quart microwave casserole cook the rhubarb, apple
juice concentrate, honey and nutmeg, covered, on HIGH until the
rhubarb is very tender, about five to seven minutes.  Mix the water
and cornstarch; stir into the rhubarb mixture. Cook, uncovered, until
the sauce is thickened and bubbly, about one to two minutes, stirring
every 30 seconds. Continue cooking for one minute more. Spoon over
the roast as directed and pass the remainder with the roast.

Red Hot Grilled Potatoes

pork, potato

12 small new white potatoes,  about 2 1/4 po; total
3 tablespoon light-tasting olive oil
1 1/2 tablespoon hungarian paprika
3/4 teaspoon chili powder
3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon salt

1.  Put rack in center of oven; heat oven to 400 degrees. Have ready
foil-lined baking pan, large enough to hold potatoes in a single
layer.

2.  Put potatoes in plastic food bag.  In small dish, combine
remaining ingredients.  Add mixture to potatoes. Shake bag to coat
potatoes. Transfer potatoes in a single layer to prepared baking
sheet. Drizzle any remaining oil and spices over potatoes.

3.  Bake until just barely tender (but still firm), 25 to 30 minutes,
depending on size of potatoes.  Turn a few times during baking. Can be
baked several hours ahead and kept at room temperature.

4.  To serve, sprinkle with salt and place over hot barbecue fire
until seared and hot, just a few minutes, turning often. Serve hot.

These potatoes are "red hot" from the paprika, chili powder and
cayenne pepper.  Omit the pepper if you prefer a milder taste. These
potatoes can be roasted several hours ahead and kept at room
temperature before grilling at dinner time.

Red's Barbecued Brisket

meats, bbq, tex mex

10 pound beef brisket

Recipe by: Chile Pepper Magazine - Sep/Oct 1990 Most barbecue in Texas
revolves around beef, and more specifically, brisket. When you select
your brisket, choose only "packer trimmed" briskets in the ten to
twelve pound category. The smalller briskets don't have enought fat
to tenderize them, and the larger ones could have come off of a tough
old range bull that no amount of cooking will ever tenderize. Avoid
closely trimmed or "value packed" brisket pieces. The fat that was
cut off to make 'em pretty is the very stuff that would have made
them tender! All briskets have a fat cover on one side. Ignore this!
Squeeze the thick end with both thumbs. When you've found the brisket
with the smallest fat kernel, that's the one for you. Take it home
and build your fire. While your fire is getting going--I build mine
out of a mixture of mesquite and oak--rub your brisket with a dry
"rub." [See Red's Dry Rub recipe] Make sure that the meat is
thoroughly coated. This helps seal the meat, and adds a flavorful
crust.

Thoroughly coat all surfaces of the brisket with lemon juice, and rub
in well. Sprinkle dry rub generously all over the brisket, rubbing in
well. Make sure that the brisket is entirely covered.

When the wood has burned down, move the coals to one side of the pit,
place the meat away from the direct heat, fat side up (let gravity
and nature do the basting), and close the pit. Some people add a pan
of water near the coals to provide added moisture, but I don't. Now,
don't touch the meat for 12 hours. Just drink a few beers, cook a pot
of beans, and tend your fire. You'd like to hold the cooking
temperature around 210 degrees F. in the brisket cooking area. Since
"helpers" usually show up at the first whiff of smoke, you probably
ought to put some of your leftover rub on a couple of racks of pork
ribs and toss them on the pit, in the hotter end, and baste and turn
'em for four and five hours, just to keep the animals at bay.
Meanwhile, see Red's Prize Winnin' Pintos recipe to keep you busy.

Back at the pit, after the twelve hours are completed, generously
slather the brisket with a basting sauce (not a barbecue sauce), wrap
it tightly in aluminum foil, and return to the pit. [See Red's
Basting Sauce recipe] Close off all of the air supplies to the fire,
and allow the meat to "set" in the pit for three or four hours. This
really tenderizes the meat. Serve your brisket with beans, cole slaw,
Jalepenos, onions, pickles, and plenty of bread. Cold beer or iced
tea are the traditional beverages of choice.

You'll find that a ten-pound brisket will yield about 8-16 servings,
depending on the individual brisket, and the size of the appetites of
the guests.

Seasoning Mixture For Brazier-Grilled Lamb

lamb, chinese

1  clove garlic, crushed
1  scallion, minced
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon soy paste
1 tablespoon sweet soy jam
1/2 teaspoon chinese chili sauce
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
1  raw eggs, beaten and placed in indi; vidual bowls

This is a variant sauce with a slightly different cooking method.

These amounts are for individual serving bowls. Increase them to suit
the number of diners.  In this case, each diner grills the meat first
then dips it in the raw egg to coat, then in the bowl of seasonings.
Also served with steamed buns.  If soy paste and sweet soy jam are
unavailable, substitute peanut butter (or tahini, I would imagine)
and black currant jam.

Sheftalia (Barbeque Sausages)

meats, bbq, greek

1  karen mintzias
500 gm finely ground fatty pork
500 gm finely ground veal or lamb
1 large onion; finely chopped or- grated
1/2 cup finely chopped parsley
2 teaspoon salt
250 gm panna (caul fat from pig)

Combine pork with veal or lamb, onion, parsley, salt and a generous
grinding of black pepper. Dip panna into a bowl of warm water for a
minute or two, remove and carefully open out a piece at a time,
laying it out flat on work surface. Cut with kitchen scissors into
pieces about 10 cm (4 inches) square. Take a good tablespoon of meat
mixture and shape into a thick sausage about 5 cm (2 inches) long.
Place towards one edge of piece of panna, fold end and sides over
meat and roll up firmly. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Thread
sausages on flat sword-like skewers, leaving space between them.
Number on each skewer depends on their length. Cook over glowing
charcoal, turning frequently. Do not place too close to heat as
sheftalia must cook fairly slowly so that the inside is well cooked
and the outside nicely browned without being burnt. The panna melts
during cooking, keeping the meat moist and adding flavour. Excessive
flaring of fire can be controlled by a sprinkle of water on the
coals. Serve sheftalia as an appetizer or a main course.

Slow Cooked Barbecued Spareribs

pork

3/4 cup ketchup
1/2 cup cider vinegar
2 tablespoon hot sauce
1 medium onion, grated
3  garlic cloves, minced
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1  rack of pork ribs, about 4 pounds
1  this is a pretty typical us barbecu; atment.

Combine the ketchup, vinegar, hot sauce, onion, garlic and
Worcestershire sauce in a mixing bowl and stir until blended. Pour
half of the sauce into a glass baking dish large enough to hold the
ribs in a single layer. Place the ribs meaty side down in the sauce.
Pour remaining sauce over; cover and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.

Heat a charcoal grill until the coals are thickly coated with ash. If
you are using a gas grill, preheat on low for 5 minutes with the lid
closed.

Place the ribs on a rack set at least 6 inches from the fire. Grill
slowly, for 15 minutes.  Turn and baste with sauce. Ribs should have
browned slightly. If they still look raw, stoke the fire. If they
have browned a great deal or scorched in spots, move ribs to a cooler
part of the fire. Cook for 15 minutes, baste, and turn again. Grill
for 30 to 45 minutes longer, turning and basting, every 5 minutes.
Watch the fire carefully, keeping flames away from the ribs.

To serve, slice the rack into individual ribs and pile on a heated
platter.

Tabasco Classic - Grillades For Brunch

meats, beef, peppers

2 pound veal or beef, 1/2 thick,
1  trimmed and cut into small
1  serving pieces
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup chopped onion
1 1/2 cup chopped green pepper
2  minced cloves garlic
1 cup chopped fresh tomatoes
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
3/4 cup beef broth
1/2 cup red wine
3/4 teaspoon salt
1  bay leaf
2 teaspoon Tabasco pepper sauce
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
3 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Grillades are a southern breakfast specialty that always meets an
enthusiastic reception at our breakfast table, served with a light,
flavorful grits pudding or spoon bread.  Grillades should be simmered long
enough to be fork tender, refrigerated overnight, and reheated in the
morning.  Make them with beef or veal, or try venison, which should be cut
into julienne-size strips.

Pound the pieces of meat to 1/4 inch thick.  In a Dutch oven or heavy pot
heat 2 tablespoons of the oil and brown the meat well in batches, removing
each batch to a warm plate.  Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and the
flour to the pot.  Stir over medium heat for about 30 minutes to make a
dark brown roux.

Add the onion, green pepper, and garlic; saute for about 5 minutes, until
soft, stirring often.  Add the tomatoes and thyme; cook, with stirring for
3 minutes.  Add the broth and wine.  Stir well for several minutes,
scraping up bits from the bottom of pan.  Return the meat to the pot and
stir in the salt, bay leaf, Tabasco sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Lower
the heat and simmer, covered, for 1-1/2 hours, or until the meat is very
tender, stirring occasionally.

Remove the bay leaf.  Stir in the parsley, cool, and refrigerate overnight.

Reheat the grillades before serving, and serve with Cheese Grits (see
recipe).

Texas Barbecued Beef Brisket

meats, bbq

10 pound beef brisket
2 cup all-south barbecue rub; see
2 cup basic all-American barbecue sauce

Recipe by: The Thrill of the Grill by Chris Schlesinger 1. Rub the
brisket thoroughly on all its sides with the barbecue rub, and allow
it to come to room temperature.

2. In the pit of a covered grill, build a very small fire on one side
as far up against one wall as possible. Place the brisket on the
grill on the side opposite from the fire so that none of the brisket
is directly over the flame. Put the top on the cooker, pull up a
chair, and grab the cooler.

This is where a person learns about the Zen of Barbecue. You gotta
keep the fire going, but very quietly. If you've got a thermometer on
your covered grill, you want to keep the temperature between 180 and
220 F. Remer, "Slow and low is the way to go." You have to figure out
your own personal refueling policy. The one I like is one handful of
coals or wood chunks to every beer.

This goes on for about 8 to 10 hours or however long you can make it,
the longer the better. Don't be scared by the darkening of the
exterior, the outside of the brisket will be superdark--my personal
favorite part.

3. Upon completion, pull the brisket out, trim off any excess fat, and
slice it thin. Serve with barbecue sauce on the side--no pro would
ever cover properly cooked brisket with sauce, he'd just dab on a
touch.

Obviously the key here is a tremendous amount of patience and a day
when you want to do nothing but sit around. But the end product is
one of those great culinary events that results from spending a lot
of time doing something that is relaxing and enjoyable. Make sure you
have plenty of tall boys for eating this.

Texas Barbequed Beef Brisket

beef, bbq

1 each boneless beef brisket (6 to  8 poun; ds)
2 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
1 tablespoon butter
1 each medium onion, grated
1 1/2 cup catsup
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce

Trim external fat on beef brisket to 1/4 inch. Combine paprika and
1/2 teaspoon of the black pepper; rub evenly over surface of beef brisket.
Place brisket, fat side down, in 11 1/2 X 9" disposable foil pan. Add
1 cup water.  Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil. Place in center
of grid over very low coals (use a single layer of coals with space
in between each); cover cooker.  Cook 5 - 6 hours, turning brisket
over every 1 1/2 hours; use baster to remove fat from pan as it
accumulates. Add 1/2 cup water, if needed, to pan during cooking.
(Add just enough briquette during cooking to keep coals at a very low
temperature). Remove brisket from pan; place on grid, fat side down,
directly over very low coals. Reserve pan dripping. Cover; continue
cooking for 30 minutes to 1 hour.

Meanwhile, skim fat from pan drippings; reserve 1 cup drippings. Melt
butter in medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion; cook until
tender crisp.  Add reserved pan drippings, remaining 1/2 teaspoon
black pepper, the catsup, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce and hot
pepper sauce; simmer
15    minutes.

Carve brisket into thin slices across the grain; serve with sauce.
Garnish with fresh peppers and lemon and lime slices.

Note:  For a smokier flavor, soak oak, pecan, mesquite or hickory
chips in water 30 minutes and add to very low coals.

Texas Beef Barbecue

main dish, sauces, beef, bbq

3 1/2 pound beef brisket; in 1 piece
1 cup catsup
1/2 cup cider vinegar
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup (1/2 cube) butter
3  ribs celery; finely chopped
1 medium onion; finely chopped
2  cloves garlic; minced
1 medium fresh or canned green chile
1  seeded and minced; or
2 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

When the fire has burned down to hot coals, spread to provide
moderate heat and fit a drip pan in front of in the center of the
coals. Place the brisket, fat side up, over the drip pan. Cover the
grill and adjust the dampers to maintain slow steady heat. While the
meat is cooking, in a sauce pan combine all of the other ingredients,
blending well, and simmer for 10 minutes.  After 1 hour, baste the
meat lightly with the sauce and turn the meat as needed to cook
evenly. Replenish the fire as needed, but don't pile the coals, as
the brisket should cook slowly. Cook 4 to 5 hours total until the
meat almost falls apart. Sprinkle 2 to 3 handfuls of hickory chips,
that have been soaked in water, over the coals. Cover the grill or
enclose the top of the meat in a sheet of foil, tucked around the
bottom edges of the meat and let the hickory smoke the meat for 10 to
15 minutes. Remove the cover and brush the meat with the sauce. Place
the meat on a platter and slice.  It will crumble. Serve the meat and
the remaining sauce on split and buttered sandwich buns. Any leftover
sandwiches can be frozen and reheated in a Microwave or conventional
oven, or the shredded meat and sauce can be frozen together to reheat
later for sandwiches.

Texas Mopping Sauce For Barbecue

meats, poultry, sauces

1 cup strong black coffee
1 cup tomato catsup
1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon salt
1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup butter or margerine
1 tablespoon sugar

Combine all ingredients and simmer for at least 30 minutes, stirring
frequently.  Store in a tightly covered jar in refrigerator. Heat
before using.  For ribs, I dunk the ribs in the sauce each time I
turn them. This sauce is very spicy and some people think it's too
strong for poultry; I disagree.

The coarser the pepper is ground, the better it is. Warning: if this
is used on country style pork ribs it will make you throw rocks at
steak!

Unusual Chinese Grilled Shortribs

main dish, meats

4 1/2 tablespoon peanut butter
2 1/4 tablespoon curry powder
1/2 tablespoon black pepper (fresh cracked)
1/2 each fresh ginger root
10 each green onions
1/3 cup oriental toasted sesame oil
4 tablespoon brown sugar
3/4 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup rice sherry wine

on cutting board and cut 1/4" high layer almost (but not through) the
bottom-most section of the rib.  Turn meat over and continue to make 1/4"
layers until the rib is completely layered and is now one long strip. Using
the edge of a Chinese knife or otehr flat surface, pound meat until it is
off an even thickness. NOTE: Chill the meat well. This cutting method will
not work well on room temperature ribs. MARINADE: (Curry Based Blender
Sauce) Blend all liquid ingredients in a blender for about 15 seconds at
"Blend" speed. Grate the fresh ginger root and combine with the minced
garlic. Mince the white (only) portion of the green onions. Add all
ingredients to blender mixture and operate on "low" for about 45 seconds.
Rub suace onto butterflied ribs and refridgerate for 2 or more hours. NOTE:
This sauce is excellent for chicken, too. Place ribs on grill, basting
often with sauce until done, about 30 minutes depending on heat of grill.
Watch carefully to determine when done.

Webster's North Carolina Bbq Ribs

main dish, meats

      ----SAUCE----
1 cup water
12 teaspoon powdered mustard
3 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 cup vinegar
6 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin

This is enough sauce for 9 pounds. of ribs (for 6 persons) allowing 1
1/2 pounds of pork ribs per person.
Adjust the fire to a "five-second" temperature; that is, you
should be able to hold you hand where the meat will be for 5 seconds.
Cooking Time:  Skinny ribs-50 min.; average ribs-60 min.; meaty
ribs- 70 min.  Every 2-3 minutes, stir the sauce to keep it from
settling, baste the ribs and turn them. The sauce should run out 4-6
min. before the end or the cooking time so that the last turn on each
side should be "dry." Check the temperature frequently and keep it as
even as possible for the entire cooking time.  A covered grill is
desirable for temperature controll and also improves the flavor by
smoking the meat as the the cooking proceeds. Thee success of this
recipe depends on slow cooking at a moderate temperature, with
frequent basting.  Grease flare-ups should be suppressed with water
to avoid charring.
In some parts of North Carolina, a liquid resembling water is used
for refreshment, fueling cars and other purposes. Do not accidentally
use it for suppressing the fire unless you want to finish your meal
in Georgia.

4 tablespoon paprika
2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon onion powder
2 teaspoon pepper, black
2 teaspoon pepper, white
2 teaspoon pepper, red
      ----BARBEQUE SAUCE----
6 tablespoon salt
6 tablespoon pepper, black
6 tablespoon chili powder
4 cup ketchup
4 cup vinegar, white
4 cup water
1 each onion, large, yellow, diced
1/2 cup molasses, sorghum

Barbeque Sauce:  Combine ingredients in a large saucepan. Bring to a
rolling boil, reduce heat and simmer 1 1/2 hours, stirring every 10
minutes or so. Pour into sterilized canning jars, seal and let stand
2 to 6 weeks before use.  (If you are like me, not much chance of
this happening, but it is a nice touch to the recipe - CWS)

Dry Rub:  Mix ingredients together thoroughly.

Preparation:  Sprinkle dry rub liberally on ribs. Allow ribs to stand
20 to 30 minutes at room temperature until the rub appears wet.
Prepare a smoker for long, slow (230 degree) indirect cooking, using
hickory chips or other hardwood chips for extra flavor. Cook ribs,
bone side down, for 2 hours at 230 degrees in a smoker using indirect
heat. Turn and cook 2 more hours. Turn and cook one more hour. During
the last 15 minutes, baste with barbecue sauce diluted by half with
water. Serve ribs with warmed, undiluted sauce on the side.

Coca-Cola Ribs

bbq, marinades

4 pound pork ribs
3 cup coca-cola or dr. pepper
3 cup ketchup
1 cup packed dark brown sugar
6 tablespoon chili powder
4 tablespoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoon dry mustard
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

Transfer the ribs to a large non-reactive glass or ceramic dish pour
2 cups of Coca-Cola or Dr. Pepper over them. Reserve the third cup of
the soda for a sauce to be made later. Let the ribs marinate, tightly
covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated, overnight.

About 6 1/2 hours before you plan to serve the ribs, start a fire in
your smoke/cooker and begin heating a quantity of coals. Then turn
your attention to the sauce.

Pour the remaining 1 cup of soda into a blender or food processor and
measure in the catsup, brown sugar, chili powder, pepper, dry
mustard, and cinnamon.  Mix until smooth and well blended. No need to
cook this one, as least for now.

Add some well-soaked aromatic wood such as hickory or mesquite to the
glowing coals in your cooker.  Set a pan filled with hot water in
place, and smoke cook the ribs, covered at 220 to 240 degrees F. for
about 3 hours.

After this initial smoking, turn the ribs, slather them with the
sauce, check the supply of wood and water in their respective pans,
and continue cooking for another 3 hours, this time turning the ribs
every 30 minutes and mopping them with sauce each time they're
turned. By the end of the 3 hours, they should have long since
reached the internal temperature of 160 to 170 degrees recommended
for pork.

After the last basting of the ribs, tote the remaining sauce inside
and simmer in a medium-size saucepan over low heat until quite thick.

Serve the gloriously gooey sauce in dipping bowls with the finished
ribs.

Fabulous Fajitas (Beef Or Chicken)

beef, grill, entree

2 pound beef skirt steak
1/2 cup fresh lime juice
1/4 cup olive oil
4  cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper
8 each flour tortillas, 8-inch
      ----CONDIMENTS----
1  sour cream
1  chopped cilantro
1  grated Cheddar cheese
1  shredded monterey jack cheese
1  picante sauce
1  avocado, slices
1  jicama, chopped
1  onion
1  green bell pepper, etc.

Flank steak is a bood substitute for skirt steak cut from legs of
beef. It's lean, and some people find it too tough. Citrus marinade
helps to tenderize it. Make sure the membrane is cut. If using flank,
cut meat into strips. For chicken fajitas, use skinless boneless
chicken breasts. Do not marinade for more than 60 minutes. -- Beth

Flesh Of The Pig Ala Bob Greenberg (And Secre

meats, pork, sauces, bbq

      ----BASIC RIBS----
3 pound country ribs or other
1 cup cider vinegar
2 tablespoon black pepper fine ground
2 tablespoon garlic salt
      ----SAUCE FOR REHEATING----
1  open pit small bottle
1  small bottle a-1 sauce
1/4 cup molasses
1  supply of hickory chips

Regular old supermarket pork. Spare ribs, country ribs, or any other
pork Not too much fat. Cut off any gross excess, and cut them to EVEN
thickness. You'll ruin everything if you cook the meat unevenly. You
may compensate by scoring the meat. In a large baking pan, soak the
ribs with cider vinegar, after which sprinkle them with garlic salt
and finely ground black pepper. (Don't use pepper mills, or other
peppers.) It doesn't seem to matter how long the ribs soak, or how
much vinegar is on them. Just make sure it hits all sides, you don't
have to puncture them. This sweetens the meat. The key to the fire is
the hickory chips. Keep feeding these amazing little fellows to the
charcoal. The flavor comes out of these chips and you cannot do
without them. Make sure the fat and chips don't light up your whole
dinner and ruin it. Cooking: A moderate hot fire a couple of inches
or more from the meat, and a grill of reasonable cleanness. As the
meat cooks turn it often, do not let it burn, do not baste it with
anything. Don't cover the grill and don't stray too far -- fire is
always hiding in the wings. Here is the catch -- the trick -- the
hard part, is the timing. You may ruin some meals before you hit it,
but the time to take them off the grill is one minute after trichina
danger is past. As soon as the meat turns brown it's time to eat. You
can use the small strips you cut off to judge just when things are
perfect. Special Purpose Sauce: (don't eat it cold, it's awful) 1
bottle Open Pit, One bottle A-1 Sauce, 1/4 C of molasses. Start
re-heating the sauce until slow boil, dump in the cold pork from the
fridge. alt. without sauce wrap the meat in foil and heat at 325 oven
for 15-20 minutes. Sauce can be stored and re-used, but remember it
will have pork fat in it now.

Hamburger Basics

beef, bbq

18 ounce ground chuck -- 85%
3 large english muffins
1  freshly ground pepper
      Toppings-----
1  cheese sliced
1  lettuce
1  tomatoes -- sliced
1  onion -- sliced
1  bacon

Use freshly ground beef. Take the ground beef and break it apart in a
large bowl. Grind the pepper over it and mix with a large fork, I
find the 2-tined one with the long handle works best. Divide the meat
into three mounds on waxed paper. Form the mounds into patties. DO
NOT PRESS it tight, just kind of gather it up and form the patties,
pressing lightly to form(about 1 to 1 1/2-inches thick). Grill over
medium high heat until the juices just begin to appear on the top,
then flip it over and continue cooking for about half the time took
for the first side. Serve of toasted muffins with whatever toppings
you like.

If you press the meat tight, you end up with tuff fast-food stype
burger

I do not use salt in the mixture because it tuffings the meat and
draws out the juices. Salt can added, if desires, when assembling
finished burgers.

Other herbs can be added to the meat when mixing, but I find that a
good burger is one were the meat is left alone and the toppings are
added later.

Hot Shins

poultry, bbq

16 each chicken drumsticks (2 /12 to 3 1/2; pounds)
1/4 cup flour
2 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon black pepper, ground
1 teaspoon white pepper, ground
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, ground
1 teaspoon thyme, ground
1 teaspoon garlic, powder
1 teaspoon salt

The day before you plan to serve these drumsticks, lay them out on a
cutting board or butcher block and pierce them all over with a fork so
that, when they are seasoned, the spices will permeate the meat
nicely. Set aside.

Measure into a Ziploc-type plastic bag the flour, paprika, black,
white, and cayenne pepper, thyme, garlic powder, and salt. Close the
bag and shake to blend the spice well.

Add the drumsticks to the bag, zip it shut again, and shake until the
drumsticks are thoroughly coated with the seasoning. Refrigerate
overnight.

The following day, about 2 hours before dinnertime, fire up your
smoker and, when the coals are glowing, add some wet wood to the fire
pan and fill the water pan halfway with hot water. Transfer the
drumsticks from their bag to the grill and cover the smoker snugly.

Smoke at 200 to 220 degrees for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the juice
runs clear when the meat is pricked and the drums are lusciously
tender.

Kingly Smoked Salmon

grill, seafood

1  pacific king salmon*
1  alder wood for smoking
      ----RUB----
1/4 cup dill, dried
1/4 cup brown sugar
2 teaspoon kosher salt
2 teaspoon fresh-ground black pepper
      ----MOP (OPTIONAL----
1  remaining rub
1 cup cider vinegar
1/4 cup oil (canola or corn)

*butterflied tail section; or use coho or silver salmon

1. The night before you plan to barbecue, combine the
rub ingredients in a small bowl. Open the salmon flat
and massage it well with about 2/3 of the rub,
reserving the rest of the mixture. Fold the salmon
back into its original shape, place it in a plastic
bag, and refrigerate it overnight.

2. Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the
temperature to 180' to 200' F.

3. Remove the salmon from the refrigerator and let it
sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.

4. If you plan to baste the fish, stir the remaining
rub together with the other mop ingredients in a small
saucepan and warm the mixture over low heat.

5. Transfer the salmon to the smoker skin side down,
placing the fish as far from the fire as possible.
Cook for 50 to 60 minutes, mopping it after 10 and 30
minutes in a wood-burning pit, or as appropriate for
your style of smoker. The salmon should flake easily
when done. Have a large spatula and a platter ready
when taking the salmon off the smoker, because it can
fall apart easily. Serve hot or chilled.

barbecue Tips: Alder remains the best wood for smoking
Pacific salmon. Alder chips are fairly common across
the country, but you may have more difficulty finding
the wood in chunks or logs. Fruit woods are the best
substitute, particularly when mixed with smaller
pieces of alder.

Lime-Ginger Smoked Salmon

bbq, seafood, smoker, diabetic, low-fat/cal

3 pound whole salmon
1  lime; juiced
1 tablespoon grated lime peel
1 tablespoon fresh ginger and
1 teaspoon powdered ginger
3  handfuls dried apple or
1  maple twigs
12 ounce apple juice
1/2 teaspoon powdered ginger or
3 slice fresh ginger
3 cup cooked brown rice or
1  couscous

Clean salmon; discard head.  Peel ginger and slice very thin. Wash
and pat salmon dry.  Rub salmon with lime juice. Put ginger slices
and lime peel inside cavity of fish. Sprinkle powdered ginger over
exterior of fish. cover fish lightly with plastic wrap and
refrigerate 2 hours.
Soak twigs 30 in water 30 minutes; drain.
Prepare smoker according to manufacturer's directions. Fill fire pan
about three-quarters full of hardwood charcoal and heat coals. Arrange
twigs over hot coals. Fill water pan about three-quarters full with
hot water.  Add apple juice and ginger to water pan and place pan in
smoker as aromatic.
Unwrap salmon and place on sprayed grid.  cover quickly. smoke
salmon about 3 hours or until fish flakes easily when prodded with
fork. Skin will turn a smoky color.
While smoking, remember not to remove lid of smoker more than is
necessary because it allows heat and moisture to escape, which slows
the smoking process. also, while using smoker, check every 30 minutes
to see if hot water or coals have to be replenished. Be careful and
use pot holders.
Serve fish warm or cold with hot rice.

NOTE:  A perfect way to store fresh ginger is to peel it, place it in
a small jar, cover it with sherry, and refrigerate. The sherry adds
flavor and body to the taste of the ginger.

Marinated Thai Beef

main dish, bbq

2 each strip loin steaks 6 ounce. ea.
1  lemon grass stalk
1  lime leaf
1  garlic clove
2  scallions
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon chili paste
1 teaspoon curry powder, hot or mild
1 teaspoon tumeric
1/2  hot red pepper, chopped
1/2 cup thick coconut milk
1  salt to taste
      ----VEGETABLES----
1  mushrooms
1  snow peas
1  red or green pepper
1  cabbage
1  celery
1  green onions

Coarsely chop the lemon grass and lime leaf. Peel the garlic and
onions and chop. Add these plus the spices and the red pepper to a
food processor. Pour in the coconut milk and blend to a thick paste.
(If you can't find thick coconut milk, use regular but pour off and
save the thin liquid on top and use the thick cream on the bottom of
the can.)

Spread the marinade on both sides of the steaks. It should be like a
crust on the meat. Let stand in the fridge for 3 hours to overnight.
Save the remaining marinade.

Grill the steaks on a hot grill to medium (or as desired). While the
steaks are grilling, stir-fry a selection of veggies in a wok until
tender crisp. Remove veggies and keep warm. Add the saved marinade to
the wok and add the remaining coconut milk or the thin liquid poured
off the top. Simmer until slightly reduced, or if too thick add a
little water or fish sauce. Salt to taste, and return the veggies to
the wok; stir to coat.

Slice the meat across the grain into 1/2" slices. Arrange on top of
hot steamed rice or rice noodles. Top with veggies and sauce. Garnish
with a small dollop of chili paste if desired.

The tumeric gives this dish a wonderful bright yellow color. You can
substitute chicken breasts or pork steaks for the strip loin.

that take the high middle ground between Eastern and Western styles.
Like this version, they are often medium-bodied mixtures, moderate in
sweet, heat, and everything else except taste.

In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onions and
saute for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the onions begin to turn golden.
Stir in the remaining ingredients, reduce the heat to low, and cook
until the mixture thickens, approximately 20 minutes. Stir frequently.

Use the sauce warm. It keeps, refrigerated, for a couple of weeks.

Memphis Style Method For Ribs - Weber

sauces, bbq

      ----MEMPHIS STYLE METHOD----

:       Memphis Style refers to the John Wills method and recipe of
John Wills Bar-B-Que Pit, in east Memphis Tennessee. John and his
family have provided pork ribs "crunchy brown on the outside and lean
white in the middle with a sweet and tangy sauce." Step #1: The
Memphis starts with rubbing a spicy dry marinade into the meat before
cooking.
Step #2: Tending the ribs on a long, low, smokey fire, of white oak
or hickory. Basting with a second marinade, turning often on a
horizontal rack, every half hour or so. Cook over a (225F) degree,
smokey fire. Cooking could take 5 to 9 hours depending on the size of
the cooker etc. Stop using the basting sauce about an hour before
serving.
Step #3: Warm the Memphis sweet sauce and either brush it on during
the last 20 minutes of cooking or serve it on the side.
Weber Method;
See #1 above and then. cook on low indirect fire on a large weber
kettle with chunk style charcoal. Use a water filled drip pan under
the ribs, a boiling pot of water over the coals. Stand the ribs up on
edge in a vertical rack, and try to cook the ribs on a calm day,
(wind under 10mph).
Cook 5 to 7 hours basting often (every half hour), with the basting
sauce, STOP using the basting sauce about an hour before serving.
See step #3 above for sweet sauce tips.

Memphis Style Sweet Sauce For Ribs

sauces, bbq

8 ounce tomato sauce
1/2 cup spicy honey mustard
1 cup catsup
1 cup red wine vinegar
1 cup water
1/4 cup Worcestershire; smoked
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce; regular
1/4 cup oil
2 tablespoon Tabasco sauce
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon paprika; hungarian, mild
1 tablespoon seasoned salt
1 1/2 tablespoon garlic powder; or 5 cloves fresh garlic,
1/8 teaspoon chili powder
1/8 teaspoon anaheim chili/cayenne
1/8 teaspoon white pepper
1  black pepper; freshly ground
1/8 teaspoon numex chili powder
1  neem leaf; crushed or bay

:       Combine ingredients in a large heavy weight Dutch oven. Bring
to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
:       I like to serve this sauce at the table and not baste the
ribs with it while they are on the grill. If you paint this sauce on
while the ribs are hot but off from the fire they will glaze and very
slightly brown.
Baste the ribs with this marinade only during the last half hour of
cooking, to glaze the ribs and make them slightly brown...
If this sauce is put on the ribs too early the sugar will blacken the
outside of the ribs and be unpleasant looking but not bad tasting....
The goal is NOT to blacken the outside of the ribs at all, so I
usually serve the sauce at the table near the ribs..... Enjoy this
sauce.

Michael's Braised Ribs

meats, bbq

      ----BRAISING SAUCE----
1 large onion; finely minced
1 medium carrot; finely minced
1  celery stalk; finely sliced
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon tomato paste
6 pound baby back ribs
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
4 cup all-purpose stock or low-sodium chi; cken broth
3  bay leaves
1  sprig fresh thyme; -=or=- dried thyme
      ----BARBECUE RIBS----
6 pound braised baby back ribs
1  braising liquid from ribs
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/4 cup cider vinegar
2 tablespoon catsup
1 tablespoon dry mustard
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

BRAISING SAUCE: Preheat oven to 350F. Mix onions, carrots, celery,
garlic and tomato paste together and then place in a roasting pan
large enough to comfortably hold the ribs in a single layer. Lay the
ribs on top and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add stock, bay leaves
and thyme. Cover and place in the oven for 1 hour. Remove from oven,
remove the ribs and set aside to cool. Strain the braising liquid and
discard the vegetables. TO FREEZE RIBS: Pour the liquid into a small
freezer container and place in refrigerator to cool for 1 hour. When
cool, remove and discard any fat that has congealed on the surface of
the liquid. Cover tightly and place in freezer for up to 3 months.
Wrap the meat in plastic wrap and then place in airtight plastic
freezer bags or containers. You may freeze meat for up to 3 months,
also. BARBECUE RIBS: TO BARBECUE THE RIBS: Preheat oven to 375F or
light a charcoal grill. Defrost the braising liquid. Defrost the ribs
or not; it's not important. Combine the sugar and vinegar in a
1-quart pot and place over medium heat on top of the stove. Cook
until the vinegar reduces and forms a syrup with the sugar, about 8
minutes. Watch carefully as the syrup will suddenly darken in color.
Immediately add the rib braising liquid, then the catsup, mustard,
Worcestershire, cloves, chili powder and cayenne pepper. Cook,
reducing the liquid until it has a thick sauce-like consistency.
Remove from the heat and set aside. TO COOK RIBS IN THE OVEN, place
ribs in a roasting pan, cover, place in oven and turn temperature to
350F. Cook for 30 minutes, basting with more barbecue sauce every 10
minutes. TO COOK ON THE GRILL, wait until the coals become white hot
and pile them on one side of the grill. Place the ribs on the grill
so they are not directly over the coals and cover the grill so that
smoke collects inside. If your grill does not have a cover, improvise
one out of aluminum foil. Cook for 30 minutes, basting with more
barbecue sauce every 10 minutes. When ribs are well heated, remove to
a platter and serve. Offer any additional barbecue sauce on the side.

Micronesian Chicken

poultry, bbq

4  chicken breasts (leave bones and sk; in intact)
3  lemons
1 medium onion, chopped
12 ounce beer
4 ounce soy sauce
1  garlic clove, mashed or chopped

Squeeze the juice of the lemons over the chicken and let stand while
preparing the rest of the marinade.

In a large bowl, combine the beer, soy sauce, chopped onion and
chopped garlic.  Drain the lemon juice from above into this mixture.

Put the chicken in the marinade, cover and refrigerate for 3 hours
minimum. It's better to marinate overnight. Make sure chicken is
covered by marinade.

Over an OPEN outdoor grill (gas or charcoal), cook the chicken for
about 40 minutes turning every 10 minutes or so. Each time the
chicken is turned, re- dip the pieces in the marinade.

NOTES:

*  Easy marinated chicken for outdoor barbecue -- This recipe was obtained
from a friend of a friend several years ago. It has been a hit every
time and is guaranteed to have your downwind neighbors salivating at
your doorstep. Yield:  serves 2-4.

*  More chicken may be added to this recipe; the only limiting factor
is that the chicken be covered with the marinade while in the
refrigerator.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes to prepare marinade, overnight in refrigerator, 40
minutes to cook.
: Precision:  no need to measure.

Mock Gyros

main dish, meats, bbq

1 each 5-6 pound leg of lamb
2 pound boneless beef round steak
1 tablespoon salt
2 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed
2 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 cup cooking oil
1/2 cup lemon juice
1/4 cup finely chopped onion
4 each cloves garlic, minced
8 ounce plain yogurt
1/2 cup chopped cucumber
1 each clove garlic, minced
20 each pita bread rounds, halved
2 each medium tomatoes, chopped
1 cup snipped fresh parsley

o  Have your butcher bone and butterfly the leg of lamb.  Place lamb, cut
side up, and beef side by side on a work surface; cover with clear plastic
wrap.  Using the smooth side of a meat mallet, pound each piece of meat to
a 16 X 12 inch rectangle, 1/2 to 1/4 inch thick. Cut and patch meats where
necessary to make the surface even.

o  Combine salt, thyme, coriander, and pepper; sprinkle over meat. Pound in
seasonings.  Place beef atop lamb, fitting meat to edges. Pound together.
Fold meat; place in a plastic bag set in a shallow dish.

o  For marinade, in a small bowl combine oil, lemon juice, onion, and 4
cloves garlic; pour over meat and seal bag; marinate in the refrigerator
for 6 to 24 hours, turning occasionally.

o  Remove meat from marinade, reserving marinade.  Unfold meat and roll up,
jelly-roll style, beginning at narrow end.  Tie meat securely with string,
first at center, then half-way between center and each end. Tie lengthwise.
Finish securing the roll by tying once more between each crosswise string
and 1" from each end.

o  Insert spit rod; center the meat on the spit and test balance. Fasten
with holding forks.  Arrange hot coals around a drip pan; test for MEDIUM
HOT heat where the meat will be.  Attach spit, turn on the motor, and lower
the grill hood.  Let the meat rotate over the drip pan for 1 to 2 hours or
till rare to medium rare (140 to 150 degrees), brushing with the reserved
marinade occasionally.

o  Remove meat from the spit.  For sauce, combine yogurt, cucumber, and 1
clove garlic.  Thinly slice meat crosswise, removing strings as you slice.

Moussaka #5

vegetables, lamb, grill, hamburger, greek

      ----MEAT SAUCE----
2 tablespoon butter or margarine
1 cup onion, chopped
1 1/2 pound ground chuck or lamb
1  clove garlic, minced
1 teaspoon oregano
1 teaspoon basil or more
3/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon pepper, to taste
16 ounce tomato sauce
2 tablespoon dry bread crumbs
      ----EGGPLANT----
2  eggplants, unpeeled
1/2 cup melted butter or margerine
1/8 teaspoon salt and pepper
      ----CREAM SAUCE----
2 tablespoon butter or margerine
2 tablespoon flour

MEAT SAUCE Melt butter, saute onion, meat and garlic, stirring until
brown. Add herbs and spices and tomato sauce; bring to a boil. Reduce
heat, simmer, uncovered, about 30 min. Just before assembling
casserole, mix bread crumbs into sauce. EGGPLANT - Halve eggplants
lengthwise. Cut each half across into 1/2" slices. Place slices in
bottom of broiler pan. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and brush with
butter. Broil 4 inches from heat four minute on each side. CREAM
SAUCE -Melt butter and stir in flour, salt and pepper. Add millk
gradually. Bring to a boil, stirring until thick. Remove from heat.
Beat a small amount of cream mixture into eggs. Blend egg mixture
into remaining sauce.  Mix well and set aside. TO ASSEMBLE ~ In a 2
qt. shallow baking dish, layer half of the eggplant, overlapping
slightly. Sprinkle w/2 tb of the combined cheeses. Pour meat sauce of
eggplant. Sprinkle w/2 more tb of cheese.  Layer remaining eggplant
over top. Pour cream sauce over all. Sprinkle w/remaining cheeses.
Bake @350 until brown and top is set, approx. 35-40 min. This sounds
more complicated than it is, and makes a great party dish, as it is
very "forgiving" - eggplant haters won't even know what they're
eating!

1  salt and pepper
1  flour, as needed
1  oil, for brushing

Rinse soaked beans.  Cover with water, add the chiles and garlic cloves,
bring to a boil and simmer for 1 hour or until very soft. When cooked,
drain well and mash with a potato masher (Note: I have tried running
these through a processor, but their consistency is much softer). Do
not remove the chiles or garlic unless you really do not want the
extra taste. Preheat the oven to 350F.

Add the remaining ingredients and mix very well.  Add enough flour to
ensure that the patties will hold together. Divide mixture into 20
equal portions and shape into a ball. Flatten each ball into a pattie and
place on a lightly oiled cookie sheet.  Brush each pattie with a
little vegetable oil and bake for 10 minutes. Flip the patties, brush
with oil and bake for another 10 minutes.  The baking helps them hold
together better. Cool on wire racks.

To serve, fry or grill as you would any burger and serve with all the
fixings.  They also freeze reasonably well.

Pizza Hut Crust

pork, bbq

2 pkg dry yeast
2/3 cup water (warm)
2 teaspoon sugar
2 cup water (cold)
3 tablespoon corn oil
2 tablespoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dry oregono leaves
6 1/2 cup all-purpose flour

Sprinkle yeast over warm water and stir in the sugar. Let stand about
5 minutes or until very bubbly.  Combine the remaining ingredients
with about half of the flour, beating to a smooth batter. Beat in the
yeast mixture and then with a sturdy spoon work in remaining flour
until you can toss it lightly on a floured surface and knead it until
it feels elastic in texture. The kneading may require abaout 2/3 cup
additional flour, that you will be coating your hand with as you
knead the dough. Don't let the dough become too stiff and yet you
don't want it to stick to your hands. Place it in a large plastic
food bag, which you can spray inside with Pam or wipe the inside of
it with oil and place the ball of kneaded douogh in this to rise
until doubled in bulk. Be sure the plastic bag is large enough that
it will permit the dough to double without splitting the bag. You can
place the bag of dough on a warm, sunny spot on the table or kitchen
counter which helps it to raise quickly and if it's summertime, place
the bag of dough (with open end sealed tightly with tape) in your car
with the windows up! When dough has doubled, punch it down and shape
it to fit two 15" round pizza pans that have been greased and dusted
in cornmeal. Add the sauce and topping ingredients exactly in the
order listed above, spreading each ingredients evenly over the dough.
Let this rise about 20 minutes in a warm place and then bake at 450~,
about 20 to 25 minutes, putting one pizza at a time on center rack of
the preheated oven. If you don't want a pizza-pizza and you can only
handle one of them, wrap the second pizza in foil or plastic and seal
it with tape to lock out all air. Freeze it before it rises the last
time. After letting it thaw 30 mintes, you can bake as directed above.

Yucatan peninsula dishes. The most famous is cochinita pibil; a
suckling pig, marinated with this spice paste and wrapped in banana
leaves, baked in a Mayan earth oven called a pib. Large fish and
venison or other wild game are also baked in pibs. I slather this
paste on guinea hens and broil them on the rotisserie, or wrap
marinated chicken breasts or fish fillets in banana leaves with
slices of orange and steam the packets. One of my favorite appetizers
is chicken drummettes baked with this recado.

Smoked Beef Roast & Pork Roast

pork, beef, bbq

20 pound beef roast
20  garlic cloves - whole
1  pickled
10  green onions - whole
1  water pan seasonings:
1 cup wine - dry, red or white
2  garlic cloves - whole
1 teaspoon mint - dried
6 drop peychaud's bitters
1  water
15 pound pork roast
20  cayenne peppers - fresh or
1  onion - whole
1 tablespoon liquid smoke
2 tablespoon parsley
2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

Stick a knife into each roast in several places, making a deep
puncture. With fingers, push 1 clove garlic in each hole, then a long
pepper and a green onion. Slice the pepper and onion off even with
the surface of the meat.  Sprinkle the roasts with salt and red
pepper. When you get your fire going and are ready to put the meat on
the smoker cooker, place some pre-soaked smoking wood (such as pecan
or hickory) on the briquets. Place seasonings in water pan, then add
water all the way to the top of the pan. Place beef roast, then pork
roast, in cooker and let them cook. I usually put these on about 11
P.M. and let them cook while I sleep. One 10-pound bag of charcoal will
usually do.

GRAVY 1/2 cup flour (for roux) 1/4 cup oil (for roux) cold water
juice from smoker cooker

After making a small roux, add enough cold water to blend roux. Then
add as much juice from smoker cooker pan as you wish. It has all the
juice and the tasty fat from the meat that was cooked. Simmer,
stirring frequently, until gravy thickens slightly.  Serve over rice.

Spicy Kebabs

meats, bbq

2 pound pork or lamb (boneless), lean, cut; into 1 1/2 inch cubes
1/4 cup peanut butter, smooth
1 teaspoon coriander, ground
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (or more, to taste)
1 teaspoon cumin, ground
1/2 teaspoon pepper
4  onions
1  garlic clove, minced
1 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tablespoon soy sauce

Grate the onions.  This is best done using a food processor.  Mincing is
not good enough; you want to end up with something wet and mushy. Don't
stick your nose into the food processor.

Put all the ingredients into a large bowl, mix well, and cover. Refrigerate
for several hours, mixing occasionally.

Put meat cubes on skewers, keeping as much of the onion mixture on them as
you can. Grill over hot coals, turning to brown each side, for 20 to 25
minutes or until meat is cooked through. (Lamb should still be slightly
pink; pork should not.)

NOTES:

*  Spicy pork or lamb kebabs -- I copied this from a newspaper or magazine
a long time ago; I forget where. It was originally for pork, but it's good
with lamb, too.

*  You could probably put some vegetables (onions, bell peppers) on the
skewers between the meat chunks; watch out that the veggies don't burn.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, several hours marinating, 30 minutes

Spit-Roasted Pig

meats, bbq

100 pound pig

You need time, friends, and funds to spit-roast a pig.  Find a source and
order the pig, rent a spit from the yellow pages of your telephone book.
Select your site out of the wind and rain and prepare the firebed, after
you have picked up the spit and before you pick up the pig. When you pick
up the pig, secure it on the spit, allowing at least 2 hours for this job.
More on that later.

THE PIG. Order a pig weighing 100 pounds or less. a 100 pound pig makes 100
servings.  You may have to wait up to one month to get the size pig you
want.  Shop around for the best prices.  If the pig arrives a day or so
ahead, have it held for you in the market's refrigerator. After spitting
the pig, you can keep it cold for up to 14 hours. Place pig on a plastic
sheet in a cool place; drape it with sealed plastic bags filled with ice.
Cover with another sheet of plastic; protect from animals and insects.
Replace ice as it melts.

PREPARING THE FIRE BED: You'll need a shovel, the spit-roasting equipment,
20 pounds of sand, 14 concrete blocks (6- by 6- by 12 inch size) about 120
pounds of long burning charcoal briquets, fire starter and matches, a
garden rake long handled tongs, potholder mitts and a large box of baking
soda. Clear a level 3- by 5-foot area down to the soil. Down the center,
spread sand in a 1 1/2- by 3-foot rectangle. Set spit supports at 3-foot
ends of rectangle and put spit in position. Adjust supports so that spit is
20 to 24 inches above ground and centered. Line perimeter of area with
concrete blocks (open sides up) to make a solid wall.

SPIT ROASTING EQUIPMENT. You need a spit at least 7 feet long and forks to
keep the pig from slipping.

SPITTING and TYING THE PIG: A TEAM OPERATION. Allow at least 2 hours for
spitting and tying. first, insert spit through mouth and out tail of pig;
one person pushes spit, the other guides it along backbone. Spit should not
pierce any bone or meat. Make sure pig is centered on spit. Next, wire spin
to spit. You'll need three 24-inch lengths of heavy wire, an ice pick, and
pliers. At mid back, make a hole on each side of spine with an ice pick,
poking from rib side out through the skin. Working from skin side, force
the 2 ends of 1 wire through holes in pig cavity. With pliers, twist wire
ends together over spit, securely uniting spit and spine (spine curves and
may actually not touch spit). Position remaining 2 wires about 12" away
from center wire on either side. Force metal spit forks firmly and securely
into thickest parts of hind and shoulder ends; clap or wire spit forks
tightly to secure spit.  Use double strands of heavy cotton string to tie
front and rear legs to spit.  Because legs are stiff, this task may require
brute strength.  To hold skin in place as it cooks, make a string net over
rib loin sections.  Suspend spit between 2 counters, so you can pass string
under and around pig. First tie string tightly at 3" intervals around body
between front and rear legs. Then wrap strings at right angles to make 3"
squares. Once pig is spitted and tied, position it on spit supports and
rotate to make sure the equipment works and that pig is balanced. A
well-balanced pig that doesn't shift its weight on the spit is essential.
Remove pig and keep cool while you start the fire.

ROASTING THE PIG. Pile ten pounds of charcoal briquets at each end of
firebed and ignite.  When coals are ash-covered and glowing hot (about 1
hour) set spitted pig on supports.  Rake coals into even layer underneath
pig.  Begin rotating pig.  Continue rotating throughout cooking. After
about 1 hour, when fat begins to drip, rake briquets from directly beneath
pit to expose sand.  Arrange coals so most are underneath thickest parts of
pig, with 6"-8"-wide band of coals along sides of pig. To keep skin from
charring, sprinkle any grease fires with baking soda to smother flames.
About every 30 minutes, rake briquets to knock off ash. Add 10 pounds of
briquets about every hour to maintain heat. After about 10 hours, fat will
cease dripping excessively; at this point, rake hot coals back beneath pig,
concentrating heat under thighs and shoulders. Internal temperature in
thickest part of animal at bone should be 140F on a rapid-reading
thermometer.  Check temperature in several places. A spit-roasted pig
exposed to the air often reaches only 140-150, but if cooking continues at
this temperature for at least 1 hour, the meat is both safe and very
palatable to eat.  Cooking typically takes 10-12 hours, though breezy or
cool weather will slow it down. If the pig is ready before the rest of the
meal, rake coals from beneath pig so it will cease cooking but stay hot;
keep hot on spit for up to 1 hour.

To serve, transfer spitted pig to a large table topped with a pig-size tray
of heavy foil, pull out spit and cut off strings. Garnish pig with parsley.
Pull off skin; tear or carve meat from bones. Season to taste.

Submerge the breasts in barbecue sauce, cover and refrigerate for 12
hours. Remove breasts from marinade and throw away the marinade. (It
contains chicken blood and uncooked juices).  Wipe excess barbecue
sauce from breast, shake barbecue spice on both sides of the breast
and roll in flour or breading. Be sure that the flour or breading
completely covers the chicken so that no frying oil can sneak in and
get on the chicken. Heat butter and oil in a straight-sided frying
pan and saute the floured chicken breast until cooked.  About 2 1/2
minutes per side should do it. Press the chicken breast with your
finger.  If the flesh feels soft and slightly mushy, it isn't cooked
through yet.  If the flesh feels firm and bounces back, it is done
and ready to eat. Serve open face on toasted kaiser rolls, garnish
with lettuce and tomato slices. Serve with barbecue sauce on the side
for dunking.

Chicken And Bell Pepper Pizza With Barbecue Sauce

main dish, chicken, italian

2 cup cooked chicken; shredded
1 cup spicy barbecue sauce
1  14 round unbaked pizza dough
1/2 medium onion; thinly sliced
1/2  green bell pepper; seeded and thinly sliced
1/2  red bell pepper; seeded and thinly sliced
1/3 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes; drained and thinly sliced
1/4 cup pine nuts; lightly toasted
2 teaspoon dried oregano; crumbled
1 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese; shredded

Preheat oven to 450F. Combine chicken and barbecue sauce in small
bowl. Let mixture stand for 15 minutes. (Can be prepared up to 12
hours ahead; cover and refrigerate.) Lightly coat a baking pan with
vegetable cooking spray, then sprinkle with a bit of cornmeal, if
desired. Place pizza round on the prepared pan. Spread the chicken
mixture over the top, then arrange the onion, bell peppers, sun-dried
tomatoes and pine nuts over. Sprinkle with oregano. Season lightly
with salt and pepper. Finally, spread the cheese evenly over and bake
until the crust is golden brown and the topping is golden and bubbly,
about 15-20 minutes.

Note: Fresh pizza dough is preferable. If you have a favorite pizza
parlor which will sell the raw dough to you, that's great. (1lb of
dough will roll and stretch into a 14" round.) You could also start
with a baked cheese pizza crust (such as Boboli) available in the
bread section of most supermarkets. If using the baked shells, the
oven temperature will remain the same, but decrease the baking time
by a few minutes.

Chicken Tandoori #1 Of 2

bbq, chicken, low cal, indian

8  chicken legs with thighs  attached
1/3 cup lemon juice
2 1/2 teaspoon meat tenderizer  unseasoned; natural
      ----FOR LOVELY VERMILLION COLOR----
1 tablespoon red food coloring
2 tablespoon yellow food coloring
      ----FOR MARINADE----
1 cup yogurt; plain
2 large garlic cloves
1 tablespoon ginger root; fresh; chopped
1 teaspoon cumin seeds; roasted;ground*
1/2 teaspoon cardamom; ground
1/2 teaspoon red cayenne pepper
1  ghee or vegetable oil; for basting

*HOW TO ROAST CUMIN SEEDS: Take a small sauce pan or frying pan and
heat it until moderately hot. Put in the cumin seeds and shake pan
back and forth or stir until seeds turn from dark green to brown.
This happens very quickly. Remove seeds immediately. When cool, grind
to a powder. If this seems like a big hassle, just use powdered
cumin. Flavor of dish will be only slightly different from original.

**ABOUT GHEE: Ghee is clarified butter. I usually use a mixture of
half margarine and salad oil.

DIRECTIONS: 1. Remove skin from chicken legs. Prick the chicken all
over with fork or thin skewer. Make diagonal slashes, 1/2- inch deep,
1 inch apart on the meat. Mix food colors together, and using a
pastry brush, paint chicken. Coloring will stain fingers, so be
careful. Put the meat in a large bowl.

2. Add meat tenderizer and lemon juice to the chicken, and rub them
into the slashes and all over for 2 minutes. Cover and marinate for
1/2 hour.

3. Put all the ingredients of the marinade into the container of an
electric blender or good processor, and blend until reduced to a
smooth sauce. (Alternatively, garlic and ginger may be crushed to
paste and blended with the remaining ingredients.)

4. Pour this marinade over the chicken pieces and mix, turning and
tossing, to coat all the pieces well. Cover and marinate for 4 hours
at room temperature, or refrigerate overnight, turning several times.
(I refrigerated chicken) Chicken should not remain in the marinade
for more than 2 days, because the marinade contains a meat tenderizer
which, with prolonged marinating, alters the texture of the chicken
meat to very soft and doughy.

Coach's World Championship Bbq Chicken

poultry

2  whole chickens (tyson)
24 ounce Italian salad dressing,
1  wishbone
1 pound head country barbecue spice
3 cup coach's barbecue sauce
1 gal zip lock bag

Put two whole chickens in a gallon zip lock bag with a 24 ounce. bottle
of Wishbone Italian Salad Dressing. Seal the bag and refrigerate
overnight. Remove from bag and pat dry. Sprinkle the spice over the
chicken inside and out.  Place chicken in the smoker and cook for 5
hours or until done. Every hour brush on a lemon mop ( see recipe).
If you are grilling the chicken, brush on more often. At the four
hour mark brush the barbecue sauce over the chicken, repeat every 30
minutes till chicken is done. This recipe works well with chicken
halves or chicken breasts. Also you can grill the chicken pieces.
Leave the skin on while grilling so the chicken will not dry out. Put
the barbecue sauce on the last 10 to 15 minutes of grilling. Otherwise the
chicken will burn if the barbecue sauce has tomatoes or sugar in it. Also,
if you cook pieces of chicken DO NOT marinate them more then 3 to
4    hours.

Grilled Asian-Spiced Mango & Chicken

fruits, chicken

1/2 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce
1/4 cup olive oil
1 tablespoon garlic; minced
1 tablespoon fresh ginger; minced
1 tablespoon juniper berries; crushed
1 tablespoon grated orange peel
4  boneless chicken breasts; skinless (about 1-1/2 lb
2  firm, ripe mangoes; (about 2 lb total)
2  oranges
1 tablespoon ground coriander
1 tablespoon chinese five spice powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
6 cup frisee salad greens; (about 1/2 lb), root ends
8 cup butter leaves; (about 1 lb) rinsed and c
1/2 cup raspberries (optional)

In a large bowl, combine soy, oil, garlic, ginger, juniper berries,
and orange peel.  Add chicken; marinate 15 minute, turning often.

Meanwhile, with a sharp knife, cut skin from mangoes. Cut 2 rounded
cheeks from each pit.  Trim remaining 1/2-inch of flesh from edge of
each mango; mince these trimmings and reserve for mango vinaigrette.
Cut and discard peel and white membrane from oranges.  Slice each
orange crosswise into 6 rounds; set aside.

Combine coriander, five spice, salt, pepper.  Lift chicken from
marinade; place on a baking sheet (reserve marinade for basting). Set
mango cheeks on a lightly oiled grill above a solid bed of hot coals
in a barbecue with a lid, or use a gas grill on high heat (you can
hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas
grill. Baste chicken and mango with reserved marinade.  Using a
spatula, turn chicken and mangoes when they start to brown, in about
5 minutes. Baste again; cover barbecue. Let chicken and mango cook
until no pink remains when chicken is cut in thickest part, about 15
to 20 minutes; turn and baste chicken and mangoes every 5 minutes
(depending on mango ripeness, cooking time may be less than for the
chicken; remove mangoes when soft and seared).

Meanwhile, combine minced mango with vinegar and mustard. Mix with
frisee and lettuce.  Evenly divide among 4 dinner plates.

Lay mangoes cut side down; slice each into 3/8-inch wide slices,
starting 1/2 inch from top down through wide bottom end. With a wide
spatula, transfer slices to plates atop greens. Gently fan slices
apart. Lay chicken and oranges next to mangoes; sprinkle with
raspberries.

1 teaspoon ground coriander seed

6  (8-in) flour tortillas

LIGHT A GRILL OR PREHEAT a broiler. Pound the chicken breasts to an
even thickness, and grill or broil on both sides until cooked
through, but not dried out, about 4 minutes on a side. It makes sense
to grill the peppers at the same time. Slice, and set aside. Combine
the bell peppers, celery, onion, black beans and cilantro in a mixing
bowl. Combine the vinegar, oil, orange juice, lime juice, garlic,
coriander, pepper. Combine with salt and sour cream or yogurt in a
jar with a tight-fitting lid. Shake well, and pour the dressing over
the vegetables. Marinate the vegetables for 1 hour at room
temperature. Place a large skillet over medium heat, and grill the
tortillas for 30 seconds on a side to soften. To serve, divide the
chicken among the tortillas, placing it at the center of the
tortilla. Divide the vegetables and their dressing on top of the
chicken, and roll the tortilla into a cylinder. Serve immediately;
the dish should be at room temperature. Serves 6. Note: The chicken
breasts, vegetable mixture and dressing can all be prepared a day in
advance. Do not marinate the vegetables for more than 1 hour. Cover
with aluminum foil to reheat. Reheat the chicken in a 300F oven for
15 minutes.

Grilled Chicken Breast Sandwiches With Roaste

poultry

6  chicken breast halves
1  without skin -- boned and
1  skinned
5 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon black pepper -- cracked
2 tablespoon fresh thyme
2  red bell peppers
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon red wine vinegar
1 dash salt
3 ounce arugula leaves
3  red ripe tomatoes -- for
1  slicing
12 slice multi-grain bread

STEP ONE: For the Chicken-- Rub the chicken breasts with 3
tablespoons of the olive oil, the black pepper, and thyme leaves.
Cover and refrigerate a minimum of 6 hours, preferably overnight.
Remove from refrigerator
1    hour before cooking.

STEP TWO: For the Peppers-- Preheat oven to 500 degrees and place 2
red bell peppers on the rack and roast. Turn the peppers occasionally
until the skins are completely charred (20 to 30 minutes). Place the
peppers in a paper bag and seal the top. This allows them to steam
and aids in peeling. Remove the peppers from the bag and remove the
skins with your fingers. Sometimes a little cold running water helps.
Remove the cores and seeds and slice into 1/4-inch strips. Toss the
peppers with 2 tablespoons olive oil and store in a glass container
until ready to use.

If a charcoal fire is available, you can roast the peppers directly
on the coals. This can be very tricky, so you need to watch them
constantly. As the peppers begin to char, turn them so they char
evenly. Once you have an even char, proceed as in oven roasting. The
charcoal roasting imparts a smoky flavor that enhances the sandwich.

STEP THREE: For the Sauce-- Mix mayonnaise, Dijon mustard,
Worcestershire sauce, red wine vinegar, and dash of salt together
well and refrigerate in a glass container until ready to use.

STEP FOUR: Assembling the Sandwiches-- The chicken, peppers, and
mustard sauce can be prepared to this point a day in advance. When
you are ready to serve the sandwiches, prepare a charcoal fire or
preheat the broiler for the chicken and bread. Grill or broil the
breasts 6 to 10 minutes per side, depending on the heat of your fire.
As they are cooking, brush a little butter or olive oil  on one side
of 12 slices of the bread. When the breasts are cooked, transfer to a
platter and allow to cool slightly, at which time you will need to
either grill or broil the bread until slightly toasted. Spread a
liberal amount of the mustard sauce on the oiled or buttered side of
the bread slices so that the dry sides will be on the outside of the
sandwich.

Slice the breasts on a diagonal and place each sliced breast on a
slice of toasted bread. Top with some of the roasted pepper strips, 2
slices of tomato, some of the arugula, and the top piece of bread.
Cut and serve as you would with any sandwich. Serve immediately.

Can be served with cole slaw or "Roasted Potato Salad" (see recipe.)

Grilled Chicken Breasts With Mango Salsa

main dish, poultry

6  chicken breast halves, boneless
2 tablespoon dark soy sauce
2 tablespoon salad oil
2 tablespoon honey
2 tablespoon fresh, strained lime juice
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
      ----MANGO SALSA----
2  mangos (about 1 pound. each) **
1/2 cup finely diced red onion
1/2 cup cucumbers - see instructions
2  peppers, seeded and diced
1  juice of two limes
1/2 teaspoon salt
      ----BASICCAPER MAYONNAISE----
2  egg yolks
1 1/2 tablespoon strained fresh lime juice
1/4 teaspoon salt, heaping

Cucumbers should be finely dice, unpeeled.-

Trim the chicken breast halves of all fat and gristle and separate the
tenderloin.  Mix soy, oil, honey, lime juice, salt, and cayenne in a
shallow dish just large enough to hold the chicken in one close layer.
Marinate the chicken in this mixture for 1 hour at room temperature
or for several hours the refrigerator, turning several times. Grill
the chicken breasts for 3 to 4 minutes per side, the tenderloins
about 2 minutes per side.  The chicken may also be sauteed over
moderate heat in a skillet lightly filmed with oil.  The bottom of
the skillet will darken as the honey caramelizes but is easily
cleaned.

Cut the breasts in thick slices and fan on dinner plates, placing the
tenderloins along side.  Spoon the salsa over the top and drizzle
with the mayonnaise.

MANGO SALSA

Slice the mango flesh from each side of the pit.  One half at a time,
make an inch cut just inside the skin, then score the flesh in
3/8-inch cubes. Turn skin inside out and free the mango flesh with
the knife. Cut the cubes in inch dice, reserving any mushy pieces for
some other use. You should end up with about 1 1/2 cups. Combine
mango with all remaining ingredients and let sit 30 minutes to blend
flavor.

**  Note:  1 1/2 Cups peach or papaya dice may be substituted for the
mango.

1/4 teaspoon cumin
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1  clove of garlic, minced
1  problano chili
8  6-inch flour tortillas
2 cup grated Cheddar cheese (mild  or sha; rp)
1 cup grated chihuahua cheese or  montery; jack cheese
1 cup salsa or guacamole -optional

Preparation time:  20 minutes Cooking time: 10 minutes

[Note: the serving size (24) is the number of "peices you will get --
not necessarily how many people it will feed.]

1. Heat grill or broiler and cook chicken until done (approx. 5
minutes on each side).  Cool to reoom temperature and shred inot
1/4-inch peices. 2. Over gas burner or under broiler, place poblano
pepper and char skin until black all over, rotate as necessary. Place
pepper in a bag and close. After about 15 minutes remove pepper from
bag and remove charred skin, seeds, and stem.  Cut pepper into
1/2-inch strips. 3. Place 4 tortillas on table and top each with 3/4
cup of cheese, a pinch of chili powder, 1/2 cup of shredded chicken
and divided poblano strips. Top with remaining tortillas. 4. Heat an
8-inch or larger skillet -- dry, no oil -- over medium high heat.
Place quesadilla, one at a time in skillet and cook until golden
brown (about 1 minute) Turn over and cook another minute. 5. Let cool

From "Catering by Michael's," as part of the menu for a cocktail
reception for 100 guests held at a house on Lake Michigan and hosted
by the head of an insurance company. Published in Chicago Tribune
Magaine 11/14/93.

[Another Note:  Now that I have typed this into the database, I see
that nowhere in this recipe does it tell you when to add the spices
~- other than the chili powder (which was not listed in the
"ingredients," originally -- I had to go back and insert that) or
what to do with the vegetable oil.  I assume one might mix the spices
in the cooking oil and smear it over the chicken breast before
grilling or broiling. Suggestions, of course, will be appreciated.
Complaints will be ignored.]

Grilled Jerk Chicken

poultry

1/4 cup inner beauty, or other caribbean ho; t sauce, or
10  scotch bonnet chile; pureed or
15  chile, fresh; your favorite
2 tablespoon rosemary, dried
2 tablespoon parsley; chopped
2 tablespoon basil, dried
2 tablespoon thyme, dried
2 tablespoon mustard seeds
3  scallions; finely chopped
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
1  juice of 2 limes
1/4 cup mustard, cheap prepared
2 tablespoon orange juice
2 tablespoon white vinegar
6  chicken leg quarter

Combine all the rub ingredients in a food processor, or blender, and
blend them into a paste, making sure that all the ingredients are
fully integrated. The paste should be approximately the consistency
of a thick tomato sauce. If it is too thick, thin it out with a
little more white viegar.  Cover the paste and let it sit n the
refrigerator for at least 2 hours for the flavors to blend together.
Overnight is the ideal amount of time to give them to get acquainted.

(**NOTE** If you want to avoid making a fresh batch every time you
make this dish, you can multiply the amount of paste easily. Don't
worry about it going bad, since it keeps almost indefinitely.)

Rub the chicken leg quarters with paste and place them on the grill
over very low heat.  If you have a covered cooker, put the coals to
one side and the chicken on the other, and cover.

Cook about 1 hour without a cover or 1/2 hour if covered. The key
here is to use a very low heat.  You need to be patient and give
yourself plenty of time. The chicken is technically done when the
meat is opaque and the juices run clear.  However, the ideal is about
10-15 minutes past that point, when the meat pulls away from the bone
easily. It is very hard to overcook this. In fact you can only screw
it up if you burn the paste by having the heat too high.  The longer
the chicken stays on the grill, the more superior the smoky flavor.
After cooking, separate the leg from the thigh by cutting at the
natural joint between them. Serve one leg or thigh per person
accompanied by a few spoonfuls of Banana-guava ketchup.

Serves 4 as an entree or 6 as a light meal.

Herb-Tomato Grilled Chicken

poultry, bbq

3 pound chicken, cut-up

2 tablespoon oil or melted butter
3/4 cup tomato ketchup

the oil, tomato ketchup, lemon juice, the garlic and basil. Place
chicken pieces on rack. Brush both sides with basting sauce. Grill
chicken for 12 to 15 minutes on one side, brushing with basting sauce

Moist Barbecue Chicken

poultry

1  cut up chicken
1  favorite barbecue sauce
1  bed of medium hot coals

As in my holiday turkey, I like to have my barbecued chicken moist and
juicy. This is more of a technique than any special recipe. Place
chicken pieces on the grill. Cook for 2 minutes and turn over. Baste
each piece with sauce.  Cook for 3 or 4 minutes.  Turn and baste.
Keep turning and basting at 3-4 minute intervals until chicken is
done. By turning at frequent intervals the sauce doesn't have time to
burn. If there is anything special about the technique it is the
frequent turning and the bed of medium hot coals. From: Syd's

poultry, marinades

1 each turkey, 8-10 pounds
1/2 cup salt
1/2 cup sugar
1 quart apple juice
1 tablespoon rosemary
1 tablespoon basil
1 each honey, for basting

Place turkey in brine for 8-12 hours.  Remove from brine. Rinse well
and air dry.  Place turkey in the smoker with both upper and lower
cavities open to expose the insides to smoke. Smoke 3-3 1/2 hours or
longer being careful not to dry bird out.

Remove turkey from the smoker and cook in your favorite way. If you
desire more smoke flavor, simply increase smoking time and the amount
of fuel used. Reduce your cooking time by 10% for each hour in the
smoker (up to 40%).

If you are using a smoker/barbecue/roaster type of barbecue, switch
modes to roast mode and baste the turkey with honey during the
roasting time.

steaks 2-3 times. 3. Have the grill prepared with white coals and
brush the cooking grill with the remaining one tablespoon oil. 4.
Grill the fish, brushing several times with the marinade, until
cooked through and opaque in the center. Turn fish after about 4-5
minutes. Total grilling time will dependon your grill and the heat of
the coals.

* To broil instead, use a broiler pan brushed with oil and broil until
center is opaque. Will take about 10 minutes total in broiler. Turn
steaks after 5 minutes, and baste often with marinade.

Barbecued Salmon With Field Greens

fish, main dish

      ----FOR THE BARBECUE RUB----
2 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon onion powder
3 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
1 tablespoon paprika
6 salmon fillets, 5 ounce each
1 olive oil for the salmon
      ----FOR THE VINAIGRETTE----
1 pound organic field greens
1 1/2 cup V8 or other vegetable juice
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup chopped tomato
1 1/2 tablespoon barbecue rub (reserved from above)
4 tablespoon olive oil

From Will Greenwood, not-quite White House chef.

For the rub: Combine the chili, garlic and onion powders, the sugar,
salt, allspice, cumin, white pepper and paprika in a food processor
until thoroughly mixed. Sprinkle all but 1 1/2 tablespoons of the rub
on all sides of the salmon. Let fillets marinate for 6 hours.

To cook the salmon: Prepare a very hot grill. If you are using wood
chips on the hot coals, first soak these in water so they will smoke
more. Add soaked chips 5 minutes before starting the salmon.

Rub the fillets with a thin film of olive oil. Grill them
approximately 8-10 minutes, depending on thickness.

For the field greens and vinaigrette: Clean and refresh the greens in
cold water. Spin dry. Mix the vegetable juice, vinegar and tomato
together with the reserved barbecue rub and olive oil. Toss with the
greens.

To serve: Divide greens among plates. Top each plate with a salmon
fillet. Spoon the remaining vinaigrette in the bowl over the salmon.
Serve hot.

Barbecued Squid With Hot Dipping Sauce (Squid

seafood

2 pound squid, cut into rings
1 cup coconut milk
2 cloves garlic, chopped
6 tablespoon fish sauce
3 tablespoon peanuts, finely chopped
1 juice of 1 lime
1 cayenne to taste
1 teaspoon sugar

No country of origin, but I'm betting on Vietnam this time, mainly
from the dip.

Coconut milk is easily made if you have a blender or food processor.

Boil 1 1/2 cups water.  Pour it over 1 1/2 cups of fresh or dry grated
coconut.  Beat it in the food processor or blender for at least 1
minute. Strain it through a sieve or through cheesecloth. Marinate
the squid for 1 hour in coconut milk to which you have added the
garlic. Prepare the coals and skewer the squid.

To make the dipping sauce which makes this dish so distinctive,
combine the fish sauce, peanuts, sugar, lime juice and the cayenne.

Grill the squid for about 3 minutes on one side.  When brown, turn
over and barbecue 3 minutes more.

Serve accompanied by the dipping sauce.

This recipe will produce tasty grilled fish if you use firm varieties
such as swordfish, sea bass or halibut, cutting the steaks or fillets
into large squares.

This dish serves 4 to 6 as part of a larger meal.

Grilled Beet & Smoked Trout Salad With Chiv

appetizers, fish, salads

2 large red beets
3 cup rice vinegar
4 cup water
2 tablespoon mustard seeds
1 tablespoon anise seed
1/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon cumin seed
4 ounce grape seed oil
1  bunch fresh chives
1  salt to taste
1 ounce lemon juice
12 ounce whole smoked rainbow trout
      ----FOR GARNISH----
4 small bunches of baby leaf lettuce
1  zest of 1 lemon

Peel the beets and slice into 1/4 inch thick rounds. In a nonreactive
pot combine the venegar, seeds, and sugar. Bring to a boil and reduce
by half. Add the water and bring back to a boil. Add beets and cook
until done but still firm. Remove from heat and let beets cool in
liquid. (The beets can be done a week ahead.)

To make the lemon vinegar: Combine 2 ounces of the strained cooking
liquid from the beets with the lemon juice. If necessary, remove the
bones from the trout. Bones can be easily removed by taking out the
backbone, and the pin bones for the most part will come with it. Peel
skin off the fillets. Flake the fish gently into small pieces about
the size of lump crab meat. Store the fish in the refrigerator or
until ready to serve.

To make the chive oil: Combine the chives with the grape seed oil in a
blender. Puree until smooth; season with salt.

To assemble the salad: Remove the beets from the liquid and cook on a
grill or in a skillet until warmed. Place three slices of beet onto
each plate. Drizzle about 1 tablespoon chive oil around beets; do the same
with the lemon vinegar. Divide the trout into equal portions and
place a small pile of trout on top of the beets. Finish salads by
placing one small bunch of baby lettuce in the center of each plate
and sprinkling with lemon zest.

Grilled Calamari A La Erie Cafe

appetizers, seafood

      ----MARINADE----
1 teaspoon fresh parsley; chopped
1 tablespoon garlic; finely chopped
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 small jalapeno chile; seed/mince
1 pound squid; cleaned/in 1 rounds
      ----SAUCE----
1 tablespoon garlic; finely chopped
1 tablespoon fresh rosemary; fine chop
1/2 cup dry white wine
1/2 cup clam juice
1 tablespoon lobster base; *
2 tablespoon whipped butter

* Lobster base is a glaze sold in gourmet food shops and some
supermarkets

1. Prepare marinade: Thoroughly whisk together all marinade
ingredients in a glass or stainless-steel bowl. Add squid pieces and
marinate at least 3 hours, stirring occasionally.

2. To make sauce: About 15 minutes before serving time, combine
garlic, rosemary, wine, clam juice and lobster base in a non-aluminum
saucepan. Bring to a gently simmer over medium heat, then simmer for
4 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in the butter. Keep warm.

3. Remove squid from marinade, draining well. Grill for 4 to 6
minutes, turning as needed, until just firm. (An open grill or a
well-heated, ridged grill pan may be used. You may need to use a
grill basket to hold the squid pieces if the spaces on your grill are
too wide to hold them.)

4. Shake saucepan to recombine sauce if necessary, then add cooked
squid. Raise heat to high and cook for 1 minute, stirring to coat all
pieces well.

Grilled Fish (Rubey)

none

1 pound swordfish -- fresh
1  spray oil

Swordfish comes with skin.  Try Ono, a Hawaiian fish (comes
skinless). With fish at room temperature, lightly spray or brush with
oil. (Do this away from grill to prevent any possibility of flameup.)
On hot grill, cook fish for 5 minutes. Carefully turn over and
continue cooking, allowing about 10 minutes altogether per inch
thickness of fish. Check for doneness in thickest part of fish,
carefully pulling apart and looking to see if flesh is opaque.
Remember, fish will continue to cook a bit even after it is removed
from heat. Remove any skin, if desired. Serve on top of Grilled
Smashed Red Potatoes; top with Papaya, Pepper Relish.

NOTES : If you use your own fresh fish in this recipe, aim for about
2 ounce. of cooked, boned and skinned fish per person -- if you want to
keep the protein values in line. If you are purchasing fish, fattier
fishes such as swordfish and salmon lend themselves to grilling
better than lean fishes such as halibut and tuna. In either case,
take care not to overcook; fish will become dry, even tough, when
overdone, especially if lean. Recipe By : Jane Rubey, 1996,

Grilled Fish In Banana Leaf

fish, seafood, oriental

3  garlic cloves
1 teaspoon black peppercorns
2 tablespoon chopped fresh coriander root
1 slice fresh ginger, quarter-sized   crush; ed -
1 1/2 tablespoon soy sauce
2 pound whole snapper =or=- striped bass -=; or=-
4  whole trout
1 large banana leaf (or more if needed)
1  vegetable oil (for oiling leaf)
      ----CHILE LIME SAUCE----
3 small green serrano chiles  seeded and fi; nely chopped
3  garlic cloves
2 tablespoon fresh coriander leaves
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup fresh lime juice
1/3 cup chicken stock

This recipe illustrates the popular use of banana leaves as a food
wrapper in Asia. Aluminum foil works well as a substitute.

IN A MINI-FOOD PROCESSOR, add the garlic, peppercorns, coriander root
and ginger; process into a fine mince. Transfer into a mortar and
pound into a smooth paste; add soy sauce and blend thoroughly. Clean
fish and pat dry with paper towel. Rub garlic mixture over entire
fish; set aside for 30 minutes. Choose a banana leaf about 6 inches
longer and 3 times wider than the fish. Rinse leaf with cold water to
clean. Plunge leaf into a pot of boiling water for a few seconds to
soften. Wipe dry. Using a knife or scissors, remove the thick spine
in the leaf. Place the leaf with its glossy side down on a work
surface. (Use more leaves if needed.) Brush oil on the leaf where the
fish will lie. Set the fish with the marinade on the oiled surface.
Fold over the wide sides overlapping at the top and secure with
toothpicks. Turn over package, fold over ends to enclose sides, and
secure ends with toothpicks to make a neat parcel. Set packet about 3
inches above medium-high heat coals and grill each side for 8 to 10
minutes. NOTE: If using trout, marinate the 4 fish together. Wrap
each 1 individually and reduce the grilling time to about 3 minutes
on each side. Serves 4 as part of an Asian multicourse menu. Transfer
to a serving plate. Open leaf and serve with accompanying sauce.

CHILE LIME SAUCE: In a mortar or a mini-food processor, add the
chiles, garlic, coriander leaves, sugar and salt; pound (or chop)
into a smooth paste. Put chile mixture into a saucepan with lime
juice and stock; bring ~--

Grilled Fish Tacos

seafood

1 x no ingredients

Recipe by: Rich McCormack <macknet@CTS.COM> Marinate shark or fish
fillets (tuna, swordfish, halibut, mahi-mahi, or whatever) in lime
juice and salsa picante (as "picante" as you wish) for about 30
minutes. Grill the fillets on a charcoal, electric, or gas barbecue grill
(or a ribbed cast iron "grilling" pan on a stove top), sprinkling
both sides with Rich's pico de gallo spice mix (see above) during the
grilling. The grill can be brushed with olive, corn, or peanut oil to
keep the fish from sticking. When done, slice the fish into approx.
1/2 inch slices and serve as above.

To be honest, when I suggest fish tacos to visiting friends or
relatives from out of the So. Calif. area, I usually get some sort of
a response such as "you ain't gonna put no fish on MY taco." But
those who try 'em usually like 'em...

BTW -- Have you ever tried fish enchiladas? Mmmmm...mmm, muy bueno

Grilled Fish Tacos With Green Salsa

main dish, seafood

3 1/2 cup finely shredded red or green -cabba; ge
1/4 cup white distilled vinegar
1  salt and pepper
3/4 pound fresh tomatillos *
2 tablespoon salad oil
1  onion, cut into 1/2 slices
1 1/2 pound firm-fleshed skinned fish fillets (; lingcod, sea bass)
4  jalapeno chilies
2 teaspoon lime juice
3/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves
1  clove garlic
12  warm corn or low-fat flour -tortill; as (6-7 inch)
1  low-fat sour cream
1  lime wedges

* Look for the small green tomatillos with papery husks in some
supermarkets and Latino grocery stores. If unavailable, substitute
small Roma tomatoes and add more lime juice to taste.

Mix cabbage with vinegar and 3 tablespoons water.  Add salt and
pepper to taste.  Cover and chill.

Remove and discard husks from tomatillos; rinse tomatillos. Thread
onto skewers.  Brush some of the oil lightly onto onion slices. Rinse
fish and pat dry. Brush fish with remaining oil.

Place tomatillos, onion, and chilies on a barbecue grill (high heat).
Cook, turning as needed, until vegetables are browned, 8-10 mintues.
Set aside to cool.

Place fish on grill (medium-high heat).  Cook, turning once, until fish
is opaque but still moist-looking in thickest part (cut to test),
10-14 minutes.

Remove stems from chilies; remove seeds (if you want less heat). In a
blender or food processor, whirl tomatillos, chilies, lime juice, 1/4
c cilantro, and garlic until smooth. Chop onion. Add the chopped
onion to salsa mixture, and salt and pepper to taste. Pour into small
bowl.

To assemble each taco, fill a tortilla with a little cabbage relish,
a few chunks of fish, salsa, and sour cream. Add a squeeze of lime,
and salt and pepper to taste.

Grilled Jumbo Shrimp With Citrus Sauce

seafood

      ----MARINADE----
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1  grated zest of 1 orange
1  grated zest of 1 lime
1 tablespoon fresh basil; minced or
1/2 tablespoon dried basil
1 teaspoon fresh thyme; minced or
1/2 teaspoon dried
1 pound extra-large shrimp; about 18 shells removed;
      ----VEGETABLE SAUTE----
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 cup vegetable; (use artichokes, fennel,
1  clove garlic; minced
1  salt and ground black pepper
3 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
      ----CITRUS SAUCE----
1 tablespoon orange juice
1 tablespoon grapefruit juice
1 tablespoon lime juice
2 tablespoon honey
1 tablespoon dijon-style mustard

For the marinade, combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl. Add
the shrimp and marinate for about 3 hours. (Note the recipe states to
marinate at room temperature, but I would not leave it out for that
amount of time. The safest thing to do is to marinate in the
refrigerator.)

When the marinating time is over, make the vegetable saute. In a
saute pan over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the vegetables and
garlic; saute for 4 minutes, stirring constantly. Season with salt
and pepper. Add the balsamic vinegar and continue cooking for 1
minute more.

To make the citrus vinaigrette, combine all the ingredients in a
mixing bowl.  Whisk to dissolve the honey.

Remove the shrimp from the marinade and grill or broil for 2 minutes
on each side.

Divide the sauteed vegetables among 6 salad plates, put 3 shrimp on
top of each, and pour on the citrus vinaigrette.

Grilled Rudderfish With Maltese Sauce

fish

1  stephen ceideburg
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large chopped onion
4  cloves garlic, chopped
400 gm peeled tomatoes with juice
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1  salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoon capers
1 small lemon, zest only
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh mint
4  serving size pieces rudderfish

Good capers are essential to this dish. If possible, visit a deli
whose owners are of Mediterranean extraction and buy bulk capers
which have been packed in salt. Rinse them to remove the salt before
using. If you have to use the more readily available capers bottled
in a vinegar solution, blot them dry of vinegar before using.

In a tablespoon of olive oil. gently fry a large onion, chopped. until
transparent. Add 4 cloves of garlic, crushed or finely chopped, and
cook for a minute or so longer, then add a 400 g tin of peeled
tomatoes. chopped, together with their juice, 1 tablespoon lemon
juice and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for about 20 minutes, then
add 2 heaped tablespoons of capers, the zest of a small lemon and a
tablespoon of finely chopped fresh mint. Simmer again until the sauce
is thick. Meanwhile heat the grill to very hot, dip 4 serving-size
pieces of rudderfish in olive oil and put them under the grill for
3-5 minutes, turning once if using a conventional grill. You may not
need to turn the fish at all if you have a fan assisted grill.

Spoon the sauce onto warmed plates, add the fish and serve,
preferably with good bread to ensure no sauce is wasted.

1 small onions, red
1 cup juice, pineapple
4 tablespoon juice, lime
1 teaspoon garlic cloves, crushed
4 tablespoon vinegar, red wine
1 tablespoon curry powder
      ----FISH----
32 large shrimp
8 tablespoon juice, lime
1 1/2 cup juice, pineapple

1 teaspoon garlic cloves, crushed

Seed bell peppers.

fruit, red pepper, green pepper and onion. Combine all the remaining
ingredients in a bowl. Mix lightly then add diced mango, pepper and
onion. Mixture will keep in the refrigerator for three days.

Peel the shrimp and make a 1/4-inch deep incision on the top of each

running water, open the incision and wash away any brownish-black
waste matter.

In a large stainless steel bowl, combine the lime juice, pineapple

skewer through each shrimp so that each is pierced in two places. Put
the skewer through the tail area, then bend the shrimp over and put
the skewer through the thick section in the upper body area.

You should be able to fit 4 shrimp on a 6-inch skewer or 8 shrimp on
a 10 inch skewer.

If you are using wooden skewers, be careful not to leave any gaps
between the shrimp, or the skewer will burn through. Place the
skewered shrimp on a grill over medium-high heat.

Grill for about 3-4 minutes on each side, until the shells turn
bright red.

The meat should be an even opaque white. Remove the shrimp from the
grill ad serve on a bed of Mango-Lime relish.

Grilled Salmon With Lemon & Thyme

fish

4 pound salmon fillet; skinned
3 tablespoon cognac
1/4 cup lemon peel; minced
2 tablespoon shallot; minced
1 1/2 tablespoon kosher salt
1 1/2 tablespoon sugar, brown
1 tablespoon thyme, fresh; minced
3/4 teaspoon pepper

Place salmon fillets on heavy large baking sheet.  Rub Cognac over
both sides of fish.  Mix together all remaining ingredients in small
bowl. Rub over both sides of fish. Cover with plastic wrap. Top with
another baking sheet.  Weight with heavy object. Refrigerate at least
6 hours or overnight.

Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat).  Grill fish until cooked through,
about 3 minutes per side.  Transfer to plates and serve.

Note: Bon Appetit recommends a sturdy red wine, such as a Beaujolais
from Moulin-a-Vent.  They also recommend serving with sauteed zuc-
chini. You could also diagonally slice thickly some zucchini with
peel left on and brush with butter, lemon and thyme mixture and grill
next to the fish; a Griffo grill would help but if you sliced the
zucchini thick enough and on a strong enough diagonal, I don't think
you would have problems with it falling through the grill. Some fresh
steamed green beans with butter and freshly ground pepper would also
be good.

3 pound small red thin-skinned
1  potatoes
1 cup thinly sliced red onion
1 cup seasoned rice vinegar
1  about 1/2 pound watercress
1  rinsed and crisped
1  salmon fillet, about 2 pounds.
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon firmly packed brown sugar
2 cup alder or mesquite wood chips
1  soaked in water
1  salt

In a 5-to 6-quart pan, bring about 2 quarts water to a boil over high
heat; add potatoes.  Cover and simmer over low heat until potatoes
are tender when pierced, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and chill.

Soak the onions about 15 minutes in cold water to cover. Drain and mix
onions with rice vinegar.  Cut potatoes in quarters; add to onions.

Trim tender watercress sprigs from stems, then finely chop enough of
the course stems to make 1/2 cup (discard extras or save for other
uses). Mix chopped stems on a large oval platter with potato salad
alongside; cover and keep cool.

Rinse salmon and pat dry.  Place, skin side down, on a piece of heavy
foil. Cut foil to follow outlines of fish, leaving a 1-inch border.
Crimp edges of foil to fit up against edge of fish. Mix soy sauce
with brown sugar and brush onto the salmon fillet.

Lay fish on center of grill, not over coals or flame. Cover barbecue
(open vents for charcoal) and cook until fish is barely opaque in
thickest part (cut to test), 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer fish to
platter with salad. Add salt to taste.  Serve hot or cold.

1  (such as yellow squash,
1  zucchini, onion, red bell
1  pepper)
1 1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves
1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves
1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
1  leaves
1  11.5 ounce can v-8 juice

1  swordfish:
1 1/2 pound fresh swordfish (4 6-ounce
1  pieces)
1  sprigs of fresh thyme or
1  rosemary, for garnish (opt.)

To make the vegetable minestrone, heat the oil in a large saucepan
over medium heat.  Add the garlic and cook just until it starts to

herbs, if desired. Cook over a charcoal grill or under a broiler just
until it turns from translucent to opaque, about 3 to 4 minutes per

Grilled Tuna Fish With Avocado & Tomato Salsa

fish

10  cherry tomatoes
1  red pepper
1  green chilli (or to taste)
1  ripe, firm avocado
1  olive oil
1  salt and pepper
4  tuna steaks, cut from the belly
2 tablespoon chopped chives
1 tablespoon coriander leaves
2  lemons or limes

Roughly chop the tomatoes, pepper and chilli and place in a bowl. Cut
the avocado in half and, with your hand wrapped in a tea towel for
protection, hold the half with the stone in it. Lightly tap the stone
with a sharp knife so that the blade lodges in the stone. Twist the
knife and the stone should come away easily. Slice the flesh from
both halves into chunks and add to the chopped ingredients. Pour over
a generous amount of olive oil, season with salt and pepper and set
aside.

Grill the tuna steaks for two minutes on each side, or longer if you
don't want them too underdone. Remember that the fish will continue
cooking a little even when you remove it from the heat. Season with
salt and pepper on both sides and allow to rest in a warm oven.

To serve, divide the salsa equally on four plates, place the tuna
steaks on top, sprinkle with the chives and coriander and serve with
half a lemon or lime.

teaspoon of the
oil. Add the tuna and coat well. Refrigerate for about 15 minutes,
turning fish twice.

Grilled Tuna With Olive-Rosemary Butter

fish

1/4 cup butter, unsalted; room temp
1 tablespoon kalamata olives; pitted, chopped or brine-
1 tablespoon lemon juice; plus 1/4 ts
2 teaspoon rosemary, fresh; chopped or
1/2 teaspoon rosemary, dried; crumbled
1/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard
3 tablespoon olive oil
1/8 teaspoon pepper
4  tuna steak, 1 thick (about 8 ounces; each)
1  rosemary sprig, fresh; (opt)

Blend butter, olives, 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice, 1 teaspoon rosemary
and mustard in small bowl.  (Butter can be prepared up to 2 days
ahead. Wrap tightly and refrigerate. Let stand at room temperature 45
minutes before continuing.)

Whisk olive oil with remaining 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice,
remaining 1 teaspoon rosemary and pepper in shallow dish. Arrange
tuna steaks in dish, turning to caot both sides. Let stand 15 minutes.

Prepare barbecue (high heat).  Grill tuna until just cooked through,
about 4 minutes per side.  Transfer to platter. Place 1 tablespoon
rosemary butter on each steak. Garnish with rosemary sprigs.

Note from author:  A simple, sunny dish with the flavors of the south
of France.  The seasoned butter is our bonus, since the fish is
already delicious after its quick marinating in a rosemary
vinaigrette. Add a sliced tomato salad and buttered orzo (rice-shaped
pasta) for a satisfying meal.  Finish with freshing lemon sorbet.

Northwest Grilled Salmon

fish, grill

1  whole salmon fillet -- * see
1  note
2 tablespoon butter -- melted
3 tablespoon honey -- melted
1 tablespoon dill weed
2 cup alder wood chips -- opt

Have the samon filleted leaving the skin on. This is important. Keep
cold. Melt together and melt the butter and honey in the micro or
another way. Lay the fillet out skin side down and pour over or
quickly brush on the honey and butter. Sprinkle the dill weed over.
By having the filet cold the honey and butter mixture will congeal
and the filet will be easy to handle. Place the filet skin side UP
over a moderate grill. As soon as the meat just starts to firm up
turn to skin side down. (The skin will keep the filet together)
Remove from the grill as soon as the meat starts to flake. On large
filets I use two spatulas.Serve with a green salad and augratin
potatos.

dishes.

Boil the Blue Lake beans in lightly salted water for about 4 to 5
minutes. Drain and set aside.

Rub some olive oil on the slices of swordfish.  Grill them about 4
mnutes o each side, and add some salt and peppr to taste. You can
broil or barbacue the fish if you dont' have a wood fired grill.

To assemble the sauce, put the garlic, parsley, oregano, lemon juice
nad water into a crok and mix well with a spoon. Add the olive oil,
salt and pepper and mix again. (It is best to make thjis sauce
several hours ahead of using it; then mix again energetically.) You
can store it, covered, in the refrigirator for up to a week. Be sure
to bring to room temperature or even a little warmer before use.

Heat the cooked, drained fennel in a 375 oven for about 20 minutes.
Heat the beans in a skillet with a few drops of olive oil and some
lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper. When the fish is done
put it on a heated dish and garnish with vegetables. Spoon on some
sauce or pass it at the table.

Thai Barbecued Stuffed Prawns

seafood, thai

16  to 20 bamboo skewers, 8-inches or l; onger
1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh coriander roots *
1/4 teaspoon black pepper-corns
2  garlic cloves, peeled
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 pinch salt
2 teaspoon thai fish sauce (nam pla)
1 tablespoon coarsely chopped coriander leaves
1/4 pound ground chicken, or moderately fatty; ground pork
1 pound jumbo prawns (16 to 20 per pound) w; ith the shell
1  vegetable oil for barbecuing
      ----SWEET AND SOUR CUCUMBER SALA---
4 tablespoon white vinegar
4 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoon water
1/2  cucumber, peeled and thinly sliced
1 teaspoon dried shrimp powder with chili (opt; ional)
1/2 tablespoon fish sauce (nam pla)
2 teaspoon fresh coriander leaves, minced

* (if not available, use the stems)

Here's my first attempt at scanning recipes using my new OCR stuff.
Not bad.  It just took me about three times as long to diddle with
the scanned image as it would have to type it in... Ah well, practice
makes perfect. ;-}

In Thai cooking, a pounded paste fresh coriander roots, black pepper
corns and garlic makes a popular and useful spice mixture. This Thai
trio-spice paste is used in the same way as Italian pesto to season
stuffings, smear over meats as a marinade, or saute in oil to flavor
stir-fried dishes. In this recipe, it serves to flavor the stuffing.

Soak the bamboo skewers in water for at least 30 minutes.

Keep the coriander bunch tied together and rinse it in a pan of cold
water by dunking it up and down to dislodge the sand. Drain
thoroughly and spin dry in a lettuce drier. Cut off the roots,
including about 1 inch of the stem above the root; chop coarsely and
set aside.

To make the spice paste, pound the pepper corns in a mortar, or grind
in a spice mill Add the garlic, coriander roots, sugar and salt;
pound or grind into a smooth paste.

Combine the spice paste, fish sauce, coriander leaves and chicken.

Mix well.

To devein and butterfly the prawns, make a 1/2 inch deep cut through
the shell along the back with kitchen scissors.Pull out the black
vein (the alimentary canal). Rinse prawns under cold running water
and dry thoroughly.

Starting from the tail end, thread the prawns lengthwise onto the
skewers, ending at the head end. Spread open the 1/2-inch deep cut
and stuff with about a teaspoonful of chicken paste; smooth the
surface.

Repeat with remaining prawns.

Lightly brush prawns with oil.  Grill over a medium-hot fire for 1 to
2 minutes on each side, or until they turn bright orange and feel
firm to the touch.  They may also be broiled.  Serve with Sweet-Sour
Cucumber Salad.

SWEET AND SOUR CUCUMBER SALAD:

Combine the vinegar, sugar , salt and water in a small bowl; stir
until sugar and salt dissolve.  Put the cucumber slices in a shallow
bowl, sprinkle with shrimp powder and fish sauce, then pour in the
sweet vinegar to cover.  Top with coriander leaves.

Makes 8 servings.

Barbacoa De Cabeza

mexican, beef

1  cabeza, beef head
4  onions
1  3 heads garlic
2 bunch cilantro

corn or flour tortillas

Before you actually get the cabeza (beef head), understand that it
won't look very nice -in fact it will look pretty gruesome.
Therefore, I suggest purchasing the thing the day you cook it.

In the Rio Grande Valley, barbacoa de cabeza is traditionally
eaten on Sunday mornings.

Clean the cabeza, removing eyes, ears, etc.  Discard the tongue.
Leaving it will impart an odd taste to the meat.  Sprinkle salt
and pepper over the whole cabeza.  Wrap the cabeza in a paper sack,
along with onions, garlic, and cilantro.  Wrap THAT in burlap.

Dig a hole 2 feet deep and build a driftwood fire in it.  Wait until
the fire goes to coals, then cover them with ashes, followed by the
cabeza, then about 2 inches of dry dirt or sand.  Fill up the hole.
Add 6 to 8 inches of dirt or sand over it.  Build a fire on top of
the ground. Use slow-burning wood such as oak or mesquite.

Leave the cabeza in the hole 12 to 18 hours.  For example, if you
begin cooking it at 4:00 p.m., it should be ready by the next
morning. Serve with tortillas.

If your spouse objects to the digging the hole in the backyard, then
wrap the cabeza in foil and bake it in an oven or over a charcoal
grill.  Using foil in place of the paper bag keeps the cabeza slightly
moister while it it cooking.  I also suggest not 'cleaning' the head
in the kitchen-tends to strain a marriage.

If you cannot get a fresh cabeza, use a large chuck roast (10-12 lbs.)
and follow the same directions.  Not as 'tasty', but a good
substitute and less work to prepare.

Basturma (Georgian Pomegranate Marinated Grilled Lamb)

meats, bbq, asian, marinades

1 3/4 pound boneless leg of lamb
1  for the marinade:
2 cup fresh pomegranate juice (or
1 cup pomegranate syrup)
1 small onion, grated
2  cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1  freshly ground black pepper
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro,
1  plus
1/4 cup for garnish
1  bay leaf, crushed
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1  freshly ground black pepper
1  salt
1  lemon wedges for serving

From: Nov/Dec issue On The Grill magazine For subscription information,
send mail to OnTheGrill@aol.com

In the Republic of Georgia, basturma is a sort of shish kebab (Elsewhere in
the Near East, the term refers to spiced dried meat and is etymologically
related to our word pastrami.) Georgians love the combination of fruit and
meat with pomegranate juice as a common seasoning. If you can't find fresh
pomegranates, use pomegranate syrup (sometimes called pomegranate
molasses), which is sold in Middle East and Armenian markets. This recipe
comes from my friend, Darra  Goldstein, author of The Georgian Feast
(Harper Collins).

Serves 4

Cut the lamb into 1 1/2-inch cubes, trimming off excess fat or sinew.
(Leave a little fat intact.)

Prepare the marinade.  To juice a fresh pomegranate, cut it in half and
press it on a citrus reamer.  Strain juice into a large non-reactive bowl.
Stir in the remaining marinade ingredients.  Add the lamb and marinate for
at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.

Thread lamb onto skewers and season with salt and pepper.  Build the fire
and let it die down to embers. Oil the grill.  Rake a 1-inch layer of
glowing coals beneath it. Generously season the kebabs with salt; grill,
basting with any excess marinade, until the lamb is cooked to taste, 4 to 6
minutes per side.  Transfer the kebabs to a platter, sprinkle with the
remaining cilantro and serve with lemon wedges.
