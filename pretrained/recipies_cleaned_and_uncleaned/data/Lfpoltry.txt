Categories    : Fish                             Main Dishes

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     3/4  cups          fish broth
                        --chicken or vegetable broth
                        --or water

   1      large         onion -- sliced
                        salt -- to taste
   1      tablespoon    minced fresh ginger
                        --or 1 teaspoon ground ginger
   2      teaspoons     minced garlic
     1/4  teaspoon      ground red pepper -- (up to 1/2)
                        --cayenne
   2      tablespoons   sherry or white wine
     1/4  cup           rice vinegar -- plus 1 tablespoon
                        --or white-wine vinegar
   1      tablespoon    reduced-sodium soy sauce
   1      teaspoon      sesame oil
   2      tablespoons   minced scallions -- for garnish

1. In a saucepan, heat broth or water until hot. Remove from the heat, add mushrooms and let soak for 15 minutes. Remove the mushrooms from the broth; pull off and discard any tough stems. Slice the caps thinly. Line a strainer with paper towels and set it over a bowl: pour the broth through the strainer to remove any fine grit. Set the mushrooms and broth aside.

2. With kitchen shears, snip the fins off the fish. Check to make sure that the fish will fit in your largest nonstick skillet. If it does not, cut off the head and tail with a large knife. Rinse the fish and blot it dry with paper towels. On each side of the fish, cut 2 or 3 vertical gashes through the flesh down to the center bone.

3, Preheat the skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Add oil; when a pinch of flour sizzles in it, dredge the fish in flour. Shake off the excess and gently place the fish in the pan. Cook until golden brown on the underside, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully turn the fish over and cook until browned on the second side, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Remove the fish to a plate.

4. Return the pan to the stove over medium-high heat. Add onions, sprinkle with salt and cook, stirring, for 2 or 3 minutes. Add ginger, garlic and ground red pepper and cook, stirring, until the onions are soft and brown, about 3 more minutes. Add the reserved mushrooms, then stir in sherry or wine. Add 1/4 cup of the vinegar, soy sauce and the reserved mushroom liquid. Bring to a boil and cook for 1 minute.

5. Reduce the heat to low and return the fish to the pan. Cover and braise for 15 to 20 minutes. Check for doneness by peering into one of the slits; if the meat at the bone is opaque, the fish is done.

6. Transfer the fish to a platter. If the braising liquid is very thin, raise the heat to high and boil until slightly thickened. Stir in sesame oil and the remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar. Spoon the sauce and onions over and around the fish. Sprinkle with scallions. To serve, use a spoon to lift the flesh from the bone.

     1/2  teaspoon      ground red pepper
                        --or to taste
   2      cups          defatted reduced-sodium chicken broth
  15      ounces        chickpeas -- drained and rinsed
                        --1 1/2 cups
  14      ounces        diced tomatoes -- drained

                        salt & freshly ground black pepper -- to taste
   2      tablespoons   chopped fresh cilantro -- optional
                        lime wedges -- for garnish

1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Soak rice in cold water for 20 minutes. Drain.

2. Meanwhile, heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until browned on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate.

3. Reduce the heat to low, add the remaining 2 teaspoons oil and heat until hot. Add onions and cook, stirring, until light golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in garlic, ginger, curry powder, coriander and ground red pepper; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 2 minutes.

4. Increase the heat to medium-high; stir in chicken broth, chickpeas, tomatoes and the soaked and drained rice; bring to a simmer. Nestle the browned chicken pieces in the rice. Cover and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the rice is tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed.

5. Remove the chicken pieces and stir peas into the rice. Season with salt and pepper. Set the chicken back on the rice, and sprinkle with cilantro, if using. Serve with lime wedges.

Makes about 8 cups, for 6 servings.

                        fall fruit chutney
                        --see recipe

TO MAKE SAUCE: 1. In a nonstick skillet, heat 1 teaspoon oil over low heat. Add onion and carrot; cook, stirring, until onion is translucent, about 1 minute. Add ginger, lemongrass and curry powder; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes more. Add wine, increase heat to medium-high and cook until wine evaporates, 3 to 5 minutes. Add broth, reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. 2. Press through a fine sieve into a small saucepan. Whisk in remaining 1 teaspoon oil, and season with salt and pepper. (Sauce will be very thin.) Set aside. (The sauce will keep, covered, in the refrigerator up to 2 days.) TO COOK CHARD & SALMON 1. In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook chard until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and refresh under cold water. Gently squeeze dry. 2. In a large nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add chard and sauté until heated through, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Keep warm. 3. Season salmon with salt and pepper. In the bottom of a steamer or large pot, bring 3 inches of water to a boil. Lightly oil a steamer basket, add salmon, place over water, cover and steam until firm and opaque in the center, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, reheat sauce. 4. To serve, divide chard among 4 warmed plates and top with salmon. Garnish salmon with chutney and spoon sauce around it. Serve immediately.

                        --plus more to taste
   1      teaspoon      freshly ground black pepper
                        --plus more to taste
  14 1/2  ounces        reduced sodium chicken broth -- defatted
     1/3  cup           vodka
   2      tablespoons   water
   1      tablespoon    cornstarch
   3      tablespoons   finely chopped fresh dill
   2      tablespoons   reduced-fat sour cream -- optional

1. Position oven rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 350°F. 2. Remove giblets. Place hearts, necks and gizzards in roasting pan and reserve livers for another use. With a sharp knife, remove excess fat. Dry insides with a paper towel. With your fingers, loosen skin over breasts and thighs to make pockets, being careful not to tear the skin. 3. In a food processor or blender, combine onion, garlic, paprika, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper; puree until smooth. 4. Spread 1/4 cup onion puree in the bottom of a roasting pan. Place chickens in pan, at least 1 inch apart. Rub 1 tablespoon puree into each cavity and spread remaining puree under skin. Tuck wings back and tie legs. 5. Roast chickens for 20 minutes. Drizzle with 1/4 cup chicken broth and roast for 40 minutes more, basting with pan drippings every 20 minutes. Tent chickens with aluminum foil and continue roasting for 30 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, away from the bone, registers 180°F and the cavity juices run clear. 6. Transfer chickens to a platter and cover with foil to keep warm; leave giblets in pan. 7. Pour pan juices into a bowl and chill in freezer for 10 minutes to bring fat to the surface. Meanwhile, add remaining chicken broth and vodka to roasting pan and bring to a boil over medium heat, scraping up any browned bits adhering to the pan. Add any juices accumulated on chicken platter. 8. Skim off fat from chilled pan juices. Add juices to roasting pan and return to a boil. Strain juices through a fine sieve into a medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. In a small bowl, blend water and cornstarch; whisk into simmering gravy. Cook, stirring, until slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Whisk in dill and sour cream, if using. Season with salt and pepper. 9. Carve chickens, discarding skin. Serve with gravy.

Save leftover chicken and gravy for Moroccan Chicken Salad, if desired.

     1/3  cup           raisins
                        salt & freshly ground black pepper -- to taste

TO MAKE CHICKEN:

1. Prepare a grill for indirect cooking.

2. In a small bowl, combine mint, garlic, cardamom, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.

3. Remove giblets from chicken and trim excess skin. Carefully run your fingers under the skin over the breast and legs to create 4 pockets. Rub half of the mint mixture inside the pockets. Spoon the rest into the cavity. Tie legs together with string and tuck wing tips under back. Rub oil over outside of chicken and season with salt and pepper.

4. Place chicken on unheated section of grill. Cover and grill, rotating chicken every half hour, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh (away from the bone) registers 180°F, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. If using charcoal, check coals every 20 minutes or so, adding more fuel as necessary to keep the fire going.

TO MAKE VINAIGRETTE & SERVE:

1. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk lemon juice and oil. Add raisins and set aside for at least 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

2. When chicken is done, transfer to a cutting board, tent with aluminum foil and let rest for 10 minutes. Remove skin and carve. Serve, passing vinaigrette separately.

Makes 4 servings.

   3      tablespoons   water
   2      tablespoons   cornstarch

1. Position oven rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 425°F. Spray a roasting rack with nonstick spray and place in a large roasting pan.

2. Remove giblets and neck from turkey cavity and reserve for stock. (Discard liver.) Trim visible fat from turkey. Rinse inside and out with cold water; pat dry. Season cavity with salt and pepper.

Strain into a saucepan. Add reserved giblet stock and bring to a simmer. Skim and discard fat from chilled pan juices; add juices, vinegar and Worcestershire sauce to simmering stock.

8. In a small bowl, combine water and cornstarch. Slowly add to the simmering gravy, whisking until slightly thickened. Season with salt and pepper.

9. Remove twine from turkey and carve, discarding skin. Serve with gravy.
