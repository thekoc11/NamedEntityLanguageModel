More Sourdough Starter

breads, meats

1 cup water,
1 cup sugar, and
1/2 cup potato flakes.

Now the starters.  This is the starter that Connie used. After that
is an alternative for people who have trouble with the first one.

Potato starter I:

Mix the ingredients.  Cover loosely and leave in a warm place, such
as on top of a water heater, for 3 or 4 days. If the mixture starts
to smell yeasty prior to 3 or 4 days, or is ready. Go ahead and feed
it and start making bread.  See the feeding directions below. This is
from the "Panola COunty Heritage Cookbook".

For people who have trouble cultivating wild yeast, this is an
alternate starter recipe.

Potato starter II: 2 evelopes (2 TBSP) active dry yeast, 1/2 cup warm
water (105 to 115 F), 1 cup warm water (105 to 115 F), 2/3 cup sugar,
and 3 TBSP instant potato flakes.

Dissolve the yeast in 1/2 cup warm water in a medium mixing bowl.
Stir in 1 cup warm water, sugar, and potato flakes.

Let the mixture sit out all day, then refrigerate 10 to 15 days. (A
10 day schedule works fine.)  Remove from refrigerator and feed, see
the feeding instructions below.  Now you are ready to use 1 cup of
the starter to make bread.

Return the rest of the starter to the refrigerator for another 5 to 10
days.  Before making your next batch of bread, feed the starter again.

Now that we have a starter, we need to feed it.

Feeding Recipe: Starter from recipes above, 1 cup water, 3/4 cup
sugar, and 3 TBSP instant potato flakes.

Into starter, stir ingredients well and keep at room temperature for
10 to 12 hours.

Makes 2 - 3 cups.

Nairobi Club Weiners

meats

4 pkg hot dogs (meat/beef)
1 can beer
1 pkg kc masterpeice bbq sauce

Chicken hot dogs won't work, beef works best but "meat" one are ok. Cut hot
dogs into 1" pieces and put in crock pot.  Cover with beer, I use the cheap
stuff. cover and cook for several hours, until the dogs plump up. drain off
beer and cover with BBQ sauce.  Cook a couple of more hours. This is much
better than it sounds.  Kids will generally hate it, but adults will inhale
it. I know...it's *hot dogs*, but this is different.

Neat's Tongue (To Serve Hot Or Cold)

meats

1  pickled ox tongue (4-5 lbs.)
2  onions
2  carrots
2  celery stalks
1  bay leaves
1  parsley
1  rosemary
12  black peppercorns
      ----ALSO, IF SERVING TONGUE COLD---
1  a little madeira
1  gelatine powder

Rinse the tongue and then soak it in plenty of cold water for at least 12
hours.  Change the water once or more during this time. Next day choose a
heavy-based saucepan or flameproof casserole that will hold the tongue
snugly.  Put the tongue into it, cover with cold water, bring to the boil
and skim.  Taste the water; if it is very salty, tip it away, add fresh
water and bring to the boil again.  Add the chopped vegetables, peppercorns
and a bouquet of bay, parsley and rosemary. Cover tightly and cook very
gently on top of the stove or in an oven heated to 300 F (150 C) gas mark 2
for about 4 hours until the tongue is so tender that a skewer will go
through the root end like butter. Lower the temperature as necessary; the
meat will be best if barely a bubble breaks the surface of the liquid as it
cooks. Skin the cooked tongue while it is still hot. Then cut away the fat
and gristle from the end and remove all small bones if the butcher has not
already done this.  Skim off all the fat from the cooking liquor and save
it for the sauce and for soups.

IF THE TONGUE IS TO BE SERVED HOT, carve it in thin slices while it is
still hot and arrange it prettily, overlapping slices like tiles, on a
large warmed serving dish.  Pour some good hot sauce over it, cover the
dish with foil and place in the oven for about 10 minutes to heat through.
The spiced Kumquat Sauce recipe is one of my favourites and I like to serve
extra in a sauce boat.

IF THE TONGUE IS TO BE SERVED COLD, mould and glaze it while still warm.
Curl the tongue to make it fit a small round container with straight sides.
Traditional tongue-presses usually measure about 5-6 inches in diameter; a
cake tin or souffle dish of similar size will do just as well.

To glaze, melt 2 teaspoons gelatine powder in 1 tablespoon water, then
blend in a scant 1/2 pint tongue cooking liquor (seasoned and reduced as
necessary for good flavour), and give it a little oomph with 1-2
tablespoons Madeira.  Pour over the tongue as much of the liquid jelly as
is needed to fill gaps.  Press the tongue down with a saucer or plate which
fits just inside the tin, weight it down heavily and leave overnight in a
cold larder until meat and jelly are set.  Chill any left-over jelly
separately so that it can be diced and used to garnish the tongue when it
is served.

Unmould the tongue on to a flat dish for serving.  Decorate it and
accompany it with a fine sauce such as a classic Cumberland sauce or
Piquant Parsley and Caper Sauce.

Nue Gra Pao: Stir-Fried Beef With Mint

meats, oriental

1 lb flank steak
14  serrano chilies  finely chopped
1/4 cup finely chopped garlic
1/2 cup finely chopped yellow onion
1/4 cup vegetable oil; plus:
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 tablespoon fish sauce
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1/2 cup water (more if needed)
1/2 cup mint or basil leaves  (loosely pack; ed)
1  green lettuce leaves

This is a rich, hearty dish with plenty of typical Thai flavors.  Any kind
of beef may be used, but flank steak works particularly well because it is
easy to cut it across the grain, which helps keep the meat from falling
apart during stir-frying and produces a tender result. Be sure to serve
plenty of rice, because it helps moderate the hot chilies without
detracting from the flavor.  You may reduce the number of chilies by up to
one half, but traditionally this dish should have a rich, hot chili flavor.

======================================================================

1.  Slice the beef across the grain into strips 1/4 inch thick and 2 to
3    inches long.  Set aside.

2.  Pound or grind the chilies, garlic, and onion to a coarse paste in a
mortar or blender.  If you use a blender you may need to add the oil to aid
in grinding.

3.  Heat a wok, add the oil, and swirl it over the surface of the pan. (Do
not add more oil if you have ground the chilies, onion, and garlic in oil.)
Add the paste from Step 2 and stir-fry until it is light golden.

4.  Add the beef and stir-fry until it is a uniform tan color, but do not
overcook it.

5.  Add the fish sauce, sugar, water, and mint (or basil) leaves. More
water may be added if the sauce is too dry.  There should be about 1/2 to
3/4 cup sauce, depending on how much water you added.

Ahead of time note: The dish may be prepared a day in advance to this
point.  To do so, proceed through Step 5, omitting the mint or basil
leaves.  When you are ready to serve, heat the mixture and add the leaves.
If the meat has absorbed the liquid, add just enough warm water to bring it
back to the original consistency.

6.  Arrange a single layer of lettuce leaves in a serving bowl and put the
beef mixture over them.  Serve the beef immediately or keep it warm while
preparing other dishes.

7.  Serve with rice.

(Serves 4 to 6)

Orange Beef #1

beef, chinese

1 lb boneless top sirloin steak, partial; ly frozen
3 tablespoon soy sauce, divided
1/4 cup + 1 tsp sugar, divided
1  egg white
2 tablespoon cornstarch
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 tablespoon finely chopped fresh orange or tang; erine peel
1/2  to 1 tsp chinese chili paste with g; arlic
2 tablespoon frozen orange juice concentrate
1 tablespoon ketchup
1/4 cup + 1 tb water, divided
1  few drops orange extract (optional)
1  minced fresh parsley for garnish
1  orange slices for garnish

Cut the partially frozen steak across the grain into paper-thin slices
about 1 1/2 inches long and 1 inch wide. In a medium bowl, combine 1
tablespoon soy sauce and 1 teaspoon sugar. Add the beef slices and
toss to coat.  Mix in the egg white, then add 1 tablespoon of the
cornstarch, mixing with fingers to distribute evenly.

In a wok or 10-inch skillet, heat the oil over high heat until hot.
Add the beef and stri-fry until the meat just loses its redness,
about 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to a dish.

In the oil remaining in the wok, stir-fry the orange peel over medium
heat for 2 to 3 minutes to soften. Mix in the chili paste, orange
juice concentrate, the remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce, the
remaining 1/4 cup sugar, the ketchup, 1/4 cup water, and the orange

Pancetta

meats

1  text only

Pancetta is bacon.  But unlike bacon, pancetta is not smoked.  It is
cured in salt and spices, and aged a few months.  Pancetta, which
comes rolled up like a salami, is perhaps one of the most important
Italian ingredients, since its flavor is essential to many dishes.
Good pancetta should have approximately the same amount of lean and
fat meat. Pancetta is still not imported from Italy.  However,
American-made pancetta can be extremely good and should be easily
available in Italian markets and specialty stores. Because of its
high fat content, sliced pancetta can be kept in the refrigerator
several days longer than prosciutto--4 to 5 days would be safe.

Paneed Veal And Fettucini

main dish, meats, cajun

4 quart hot water
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon salt
3/4 lb fresh fettucini (1/2 lb dry)
1/2 lb unsalted butter
2 1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3/4 cup + 4 tsp. parmesan cheese
1 3/4 cup very fine dry bread crumbs
1 1/2 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
1 1/2 tablespoon olive oil
3/4 teaspoon white pepper
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
3 each eggs
6 each 4 oz slices white veal (note
1 single vegetable oil for pan frying

NOTE:  You will need 6, 3-1/2 to 4 ounce slices of baby white veal, pounded
thin for this recipe.
Place the water, the 2 tablespoons oil and the salt in a large pot over
high heat; cover and bring to a boil. when water readdds a rolling boil,
add small amounts of fettucini at a time to the pot, breaking up oil
patches as you drop it in.  Return to boiling and cook oncovered to al
dente stage (about 3 minutes if fresh pasta, 7 minutes if dry); do not
overcook.
during this cooking time, use a wooden or spagheti spoon to left fettucini
out of the water by spoonfruls and shake strands back into the water. (It
may be an old wives' tale, but this procedure seems to enhance the pasta's
texture.)  Then immediately drain in a colander and stop its cooking by
running cold water over strands (if you used dry pasta, first rinse with
hot water to wash off starch); after it has cooled thoroughly, about 2 to 3
minutes, pour a liberal amount of vegetable oil in your hands and toss
fettucini.  set aside still in the colander. Melt the butter in a large
skillet over medium-low heat; add the cream and cayenne pepper. Turn the
heat to medium-high. with a metal whisk whip the cream nmixture constantly
as it comes to a boil. the reduce heat and simmer until the sauce has
reduced some and thickened enough to coat a spoon well, about 7 to 8
minutes, whisking constantly. Remove from heat and gradually add 3/4 cup of
the parmesan, whisking until cheese is melted. Set aside.
Heat 6 large serving plates in a 250F oven. In a shallow pan (cake and
pie pans work well) combine the bread crumbs, parsley, olive oil, white
pepper, onion and garlic;, mix well. In a separate pan beat the eggs well,
then beat in the remaining 4 teaspoons Parmesan. Soak the veal in the egg
mixture for at least 5 minutes, being sure to coat it thoroughly.
Meanwhile, heat 1/4 inch oil to about 400F in a large skillett. Then, just
before frying, dredge veal in the bread crumbs, coating well and pressing
the crumbs in with your hands; shake off any excess. Fry the veal in the
hot oil until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Do not crowd. (Change
the oil mid-way through frying if the crumbs in the bottom start to burn.)
Remove veal to a large platter and set aside.
Reheat the cheese sauce over medium-high heat, whisking frequently.
(NOTE:  If butter starts separating from the sauce, whisk in about 1
tablespoon cream or water.)  Add the fettucini and loss until tho9roughly
coated and heated through, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and serve
immediately.    To serve, place a piece of veal on each heated serving
plate.  roll each portion of fettucini onto a large fork and lift onto the
plate; Top the fettucini with additional sauce from the skillet. From Paul
Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen

1 teaspoon saltpeter
2 tablespoon brown sugar; firmly packed
3 teaspoon ginger; ground
1/2 cup salt
4 tablespoon black pepper; freshly ground
3 tablespoon mixed whole pickling spice

Mix the Salt, Saltpeter, spices and Sugar together and then rub into the

the refrigerator or a very cool place.  Turn every few days for 3 weeks,
then smoke over a barbecue pit or in a smokehouse -- over very low heat for
4 hours.  It will keep well for some time in a cool place. To prepare,
cover with cold Water and cook until tender. The length of cooking time
depends on how long it was smoked.  A large goose may be also treated this

remaining ingredients. Stir to mix and let ingredients stand at least
30 min. for flavors to combine. Warm sauce over low heat before
serving. Do not boil. Salt to taste. Serve sauce with sliced, roasted
tenderloin or sirloin. Yields: 1 1/2-2 cups.

Pegg's Oven Roast Beef

main dish, beef

1  beef roast

Bring roast to room temp.  Preheat oven to 450.  Roast 1 hour, then
turn off oven and leave it there without opening the oven for about 5
hours.

You can turn oven on about 30 mins before serving to warm it up a
bit, but it turns out just as I prefer  - not over done and with some
of the good ends for those who prefer well done!

This is the way I cook almost any roast and it turns out delicious!!

Peking Duck 1

main dish, meats, oriental

7 lb long island duck
5 cup hot water
3 tablespoon maltose
1 tablespoon vinegar
1 tablespoon sherry
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
5 tablespoon hoisin sauce
12 each chinese pancakes, steamed
1 single just before serving
1/4 lb scallions, cut into 24 piece
2 each cucumbers, peeled, halved,
1 single and julienned

1. Clean a fresh duck and pump it full of air through the neck to
separate the skin from the meat. (At home, a bicycle pump may be
used.) Pour boiling water over the duck three times. Carefully
dry duck, slit stomach, and remove innards.
2. Prepare marinade of hot water, maltose, and vinegar. Rub
outside of duck all over with the mixture.
3. Hang the duck by its neck at room tempera- ture, about 65
degrees, for at least 12 hours.
4. The next day, pre-heat oven to 400 degrees F. Place duck in
pan and cook for 10 minutes. Turn heat to 450 degrees F and cook
for additional 30 minutes or until the meat is tender and the
skin is crispy.
5. To carve the duck, place it breast side up and cut downwards
towards the head. Slice thinly. Use only the outer slices-those
which have skin. Slice both breasts. Slice the legs, cutting from
the joint to the end of the leg. Discard remaining meat (without
skin) or use for another dish. (See part 2 for more)

Peking Duck 2

main dish, meats, oriental

6. Combine the sherry, sesame oil, sugar, soy sauce, and Hoisin
Sauce.
7. To assemble, place duck slices on pancakes. Add scallions,
cucumbers, and Hoisin Sauce mixture to each. Serve. We insist on
using Long Island ducks for this, our specialty. When we carve
the duck in front of our guests, they may request skin only (the
traditional way of eating Peking Duck), skin with meat, or meat
from a certain part of the duck. The air separates the skin from
the meat; the marinade and the hanging help to a create a
deliciously rich, crisp skin.

Pemmican

game, caribou, dried

1 lb caribou jerky
2 tablespoon brown sugar
2 oz raisins

5 oz suet

Run the dry jerky through a food grinder a few times. In a loaf pan
add the cranberries, raisins and brown sugar. When the mixture is
well blended, melt the suet and stir it in. Let the suet cool and
harden. This approximates the old style pemmican made to preserve
meat without refrigeration and to add some vitamin C values.

3 lb lean beef chuck, round, or shank, c; ubed
5 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon cayenne
3 tablespoon sweet paprika
1 tablespoon crushed anise seed
1 teaspoon very finely minced garlic
1 cup dry red wine
1/2 teaspoon ascorbic acid
1 teaspoon saltpeter
6  feet small hog casings

Grind meats separately through the coarse disk. Mix together with remaining
ingredients; spread out in a large pan, cover loosley with wax paper and
let cure in the refrigerator 24 hours. Prepare casings, stuff and twist
into 10" links. Using cotton twine, tie two separate knots between every
other link, and one knot at the beginning and another at the end of the
stuffed casing. Cut between the double knots. This results in pairs of
links. The pepper oni are hung by a string tied to the center of each pair.
Hang to dry for 6-8 weeks. Once dried, the pepperoni will keep, wrapped, in
the refrigerator for several months.

seconds. Add shrimp and toss until they turn pink, for beef or pork
until light brown, no more that 1 min. for shrimp. Remove from pan
and set aside. Add the egg to pan and tilt the pan to spread it into
a thin sheet. As soon as it begins to set, scramble it to break it
into small lumps. Remove and set aside with shrimp. Heat 1 tbs of oil
in wok or skillet and heat 30 seconds and add soften noodles. Thin
noodles to cover the surface of the pan, then clump them together and
gently turn over. repeat this process until the noodles soften and
curl into ivory ringlets. Add fish sauce and turn noodles to evenly
season. Add sugar and peanuts and continue to turn the noodles to
season. Reserve some of the bean sprouts, green onion for garnish.
Add the bean sprouts, green onions and the shrimp and egg mixture.
Cook for 1 minute, turning often. Transfer noodles to the serving
paltter and squeeze the juice of 2 lime wedges over the top. Garnish
with remaining beansprouts and lime and serve at once. Serves 1 very

Pheasant Amerind

game

2 lb pheasant hen, cleaned (up to 2 1/2; lb)
1  onion, quartered
1  bay leaf
6  peppercorns
1 small carrot, sliced
1  celery stalk, sliced
1 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoon butter
1 pinch thyme, powdered
1/4 teaspoon rosemary, dried and crumbled
1/4 cup mushrooms, chopped
2 tablespoon flour
2 tablespoon black walnut meats, finely chopped

COOK BIRDS:  Split pheasant down the breastbone (or have your butcher
do this).  Rinse the halves, place in a deep pot and barely cover
with water. Add bay leaf, onion, carrot, celery, salt and peppercorns.

Bring to rolling boil, then turn down heat and simmer for
approximately 30 minutes, or until tender.  Remove foam and scum as
it forms. Remove bird(s) from broth, reserving the broth.

Using a heavy skillet, saute the halves in about 2 T of the butter
until golden.  Place birds into small roasting pan or casserole with
just enough water to cover the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle with thyme
and rosemary. Bake, lightly covered with foil, for 30-40 minutes at
350 degrees F.

MAKE GRAVY:  While the birds are in the oven, strain the broth and
boil rapidly down to about 2 cups.

Brown the mushrooms using the same skillet in which you browned the
pheasant. Remove the mushrooms and keep them warm.

Melt the remaining 2 T  of butter in the skillet.  Add the flour,
stirring up the browning from the pan. Cook over moderately high heat
until golden brown. Blend in the broth using a wire whisk.

Add mushrooms and continue cooking approximately 1-2 minutes. Turn
down heat, cover and keep warm until pheasant is roasted.

When the pheasants are cooked, remove them from the oven and scrape
the herbs from the skin. After placing the pheasant halves on a warm
platter (or leaving them in the casserole), pour the gravy over the
pheasant. Garnish with the chopped nutmeats and serve. This dish is
particularly good with wild rice.

NOTES:

*  Pheasant in the North American tradition -- This recipe is adapted
from the exceptionally good, controlled-circulation Recipes Only
Magazine. The original dish was created by Mary Richard for use in
her Teepee Restaurant, in Winnipeg. I found some of the ingredients
hard to locate in a hurry and used what I had available with good
results. You can substitute rock Cornish hen, guinea fowl, or chicken
for the pheasant and hazelnuts, filberts or walnuts for the black
walnuts.

: Difficulty:  easy once you have the all the ingredients ready.
: Time:  40 minutes preparation, 80 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  measure the spices.

pasta, soups, beef

      ----BROTH----
1 each inch fresh ginger
3 each star anise
2 each green onions
5 cup beef stock
3 tablespoon fish sauce
      ----SOUP----
8 oz rice sticks or cellophane no
1 each onion
12 each basil leaves
6 oz beef tenderloin or sirloin,

2 each jalapenos thinly sliced
2 cup mung bean sprouts
1 each lime, quartered
      ----EXTRA'S----
1 each hoisin sauce
1 each asian chili sauce

Use Rice sticks or cellophane noodles. Partially freeze beef before
cutting. Cook's notes: Star anise, fish sauce, hoisin sauce and Asian
chili sauce are available at Asian markets or some supermarkets with
large Asian specialty sections. Use caution when working with fresh
chilies. Upon completion of slicing, wash work surface and hands
thoroughly; do not touch your eyes. Procedure: Combine the beef
stock, ginger, star anise, green onions and fish sauce and gently
simmer for 30 minutes. Remove the ginger, anise and green onions.
Soak the rice sticks in warm water for 30 minutes. Slice the green
onions, onion and basil leaves as thinly as possible. Slice the beef
as thinly as possible across the grain. It helps to partially freeze
the meat before slicing.  Bring 4 quarts water to a boil. Arrange the
bean sprouts, mint sprigs, chilies and lime on a platter. Just before
serving, bring the broth to a boil. Cook the rice sticks in boiling
water for 30 seconds, then drain. Presentation: Divide the noodles
among 4 large bowls. Arrange the scallions, onion slices and beef
slices on top. Spoon the boiling broth on top: The heat of the liquid
should be sufficient to cook the meat. Serve the soup at once, with
the garnish platter on the side. Let each person add sprouts, mint,
chilies, lime, hoisin sauce and/or chili sauce to taste. Yield: Makes

Phoenix & Dragon

meats, poultry, oriental

4 slice smithfield ham (thin)
1  whole chicken breast  boned and but; terflied
4  pieces fresh caul fat
1/4 cup water chestnut powder =or=- flour o; r cornstarch
4 cup peanut oil; for deep-frying
      ----VEGETABLE SAUCE----
2 tablespoon peanut oil
2  whole garlic cloves; crushed
2 slice fresh ginger root
4  fresh water chestnuts  peeled & sli; ced lengthwise
1/2 cup bamboo shoots  sliced lengthwise
4  whole scallions  cut in 3-in pieces
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
1 tablespoon chinese rice wine =or=- dry sherry
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 teaspoon cornstarch; dissolved in
1 tablespoon chicken broth; (cold)

LAY 2 SLICES OF HAM on 1 side of the butterflied breast. Refold the
breast, enclosing the ham. Lay the breast on a sheet of caul fat.
Roll up tight. The caul is sticky, so it needs nothing to seal it.
Dust the surface with water chestnut powder, flour or cornstarch.
Shake off the excess. Heat the oil in a wok to 350F (moderate). Slide
the chicken breasts into the oil, 1 by 1. When they have browned
(about 5 minutes), remove 1 from the oil and press it. If it feels
mushy, it needs more cooking. Remove and drain the chicken. Slice the
chicken, crosswise diagonally, into 1/2-inch pieces.

VEGETABLE SAUCE: Heat the oil in a wok and flavor with garlic and
ginger. Remove the garlic and ginger and add the water chestnuts,
bamboo shoots and scallions to the wok. Stir-fry for 30 seconds, then
add soy sauce, wine or sherry, and chicken broth. When the liquid
boils, stir in the dissolved cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Spread
the sauce on a platter as a bed for the sliced chicken breast.

Pickled Pigs' Ears (Tai Heo Ngam Chua)

meats

1  stephen ceideburg
4 quart water
1 tablespoon alum
2 cup distilled white vinegar
2 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 lb pigs' ears

Lip-smacking, tangy, chewy, and exotic, these morsels go perfectly
with drinks before dinner, and very well without drinks at any time.

Boil 2 quarts of the water with the alum for 5 minutes, then remove
from the heat and allow to cool.

Boil the vinegar with the sugar and salt for a few minutes, or until
the sugar is completely dissolved. Remove from the heat and cool.

Boil the remaining 2 quarts water and drop in the pigs' ears. Boil
for 20 minutes. Remove the pigs' ears and cut them into lengthwise
slices 1/4 inch wide. After the sliced pigs' ears have cooled, return
them to the alum water to soak for 2 hours, then drain and rinse
under cold water. Dry lightly.

Place the pigs' ears in a jar, pressing them down. Pour in enough
cooled vinegar mixture to completely cover the contents of the jar.
Refrigerate.

NOTE: This can be eaten after 3 day and will keep for several weeks
in the refrigerator.

Pillow Case Jerky

beef, smoker

1 large boneless butt roast
1  salt & pepper

Get as large a boneless butt as you can.  Cut the individual muscles
out of the meat and cut off and discard all the fat and connecting
tissue. Cut the meat across the grain as thin as possible.  1/16 to
1/8th of an inch. The thinner the slices, the easier it will be to
dry. Salt and pepper the meat generously on both sides, using more
pepper than salt. Lay out the meat strips on a cake or oven rack
without overlapping them. Set the rack in an insert fireplace
(smoker) and cook on low heat for 8 to 10 hours, turning every 3 to 4
hours, until dried.  You can do the same with a dehydrator or oven,
but it won't turn out as good. After it's done, store in a
pillowcase. Don't STORE it in plastic, as the meat has to be able to
breathe, and a paper sack will leave a paper taste.

This dish was published by Toronto Star Starweek, Mary McGrath's
Chef's Showcase in the issue of March 12-19, 1994

The recipe was requested by Al Malinauskas of Thornhill, Ontario who
writes:

"My wife and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary last summer
at the Pine Apple Inn & Bakehouse. (149 Main St., Unionville, Ontario
(416) 940-6639) "The grilled Alberta steak was done to perfection and
the Burgundy Shallot Sauce with it was simply the best that I have
ever enjoyed"

Credit for the cooking goes to chef David Watt who apprenticed at
The Ritz Hotel in London, England, and then came home to work at
Sansoucci in the Sutton Place Hotel before opening The Pine Apple Inn
in Unionville in 1991 with James Horner and Allan Bell. They describe
the style of cooking here as "a mixture of old and new".

Typed into Meal Master format by Eric Decker March 19, 1994.

Editor's note: For those of you who wonder what an Aberta steak is, I
encourage you to substutite a Texas steak if you can't get the Alberta
version [ real thing
:-) ]. Both are mighty good snackin'

ps. Happy 25th Anniversary Al, I hope you and your sweetheart have
another 25 or 50 together.

Pookie's Liver & Onions

beef

1/2 lb beef liver, in one thin cut
1  salt
1  pepper
1  flour for dredging
2 tablespoon cooking oil (preferably peanut, cor; n, or sunflower)
2 tablespoon butter
2  green onions', minced
1  clove garlic, minced
1 1/2 medium onions, sliced
1 1/2 teaspoon flour
1 1/2 cup beef broth
3/4 teaspoon kitchen bouquet (seasoning sauce)

Even if you hate liver and onions, you'll find this tender, soulful
version a revelation.  If you like liver and onions, you're about to
see star bursts. This recipe is based on a dish by brilliant chef
Pookie Turner.

1.  Season liver with salt and pepper, to taste. Dredge lightly in
flour.

2.  Heat lightly oiled heavy skillet over high heat until fragrant,
about 1 minute.  Add liver and fry until lightly browned, about 1
minute per side. Remove liver and reserve.

3.  Clean skillet and return it to stove over medium heat until dry.
Add butter, and heat until it is melted. Add green onions, garlic,
and onions; fry, stirring, until onion is translucent (about 6
minutes).

4.  Sprinkle the 1 1/2 teaspoons flour over mixture and cook briefly,
until the flour turns golden and loses its raw aroma (about 1
minute); do not let flour brown. Stir in broth, Kitchen Bouquet, 1/2
teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  Turn heat to medium-high and
bring to a boil. Cook, stirring, until liquid thickens slightly,
about 6 minutes. Adjust seasoning, if necessary.

5.  Return liver to pan and cook on both sides for 30 seconds each (if
liver is thick, cook for 90 seconds per side.) Remove from heat and
serve immediately with boiled rice.

Possum & Taters

main dish, meats, game, southern

1  young, fat possum
2 tablespoon butter
8  sweet potatoes
1 tablespoon sugar
1  salt

First, catch a possum.  This in itself is excellent entertainment on a
moonlit night.  Skin the possum and remove the head and feet.  Be
sure to wash it thoroughly.  Freeze overnight, either outside or in a
refrigerator. When ready to cook, peel the potatoes and boil them
tender in lightly salted water along with the butter and sugar.  At
the same time, stew the possum until tender in a tightly covered pan
with a little water. Arrange the taters around the possum, strip with
bacon, sprinkle with thyme or marjoram, or pepper, and brown in the
oven. Baste often with the drippings.

Postrio's Roasted Rack Of Lamb With Black Oli

lamb

      ----SAUCE----
4  garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
4  shallots, peeled and chopped
1 tablespoon black peppercorns
1/2 cup unsalted butter
2 cup madeira
2 cup red wine
1 small rosemary sprig
1 liter medium tomato, diced
1 cup demi-glace *
1/2 cup pitted nicoise olives
1  salt and black pepper
      ----THE LAMB----
2  lamb racks, 8 chops each **
1 tablespoon olive oil
1  salt and black pepper
1  rosemary sprig, leaves only, choppe; d
1  * (or good quality lamb or beef bro; th)
1  ** chine bones and fat removed

Postrio's is a swank SF eatery.  I've never been there, but the place
gets rave reviews.  This recipe is from chef Anne Gingrass. The olive
sauce in this lamb dish looks very interesting. Might be a good
choice for the festive season rushing upon us.

The sauce:  Saute the garlic, shallots lots and peppercorns in 1
tablespoon butter until lightly browned, Add the Madeira and red
wine, rosemary and tomato.  Simmer until reduced by two-thirds,
leaving about 1 cup total.

Add the demi-glace and return to a boil.  Whisk in remaining butter a
little at a time until it is incorporated. If you wish a thicker,
richer sauce, add more butter. Strain sauce through a fine strainer,
then transfer to a blender.  Add half the olives and puree until
almost smooth. Roughly chop the remaining olives and add to the
sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Set aside in a warm
place until serving time.

The lamb:  Rub racks well with olive oil and season with salt, pepper
and rosemary.  Let come to room temperature.

Heat a roasting pan or large saute pan until very hot. Add a few
drops oil and sear the lamb racks in it on all sides until brown.
Place the racks bone side down in the hot pan and transfer to a 400F
oven. Roast to medium rare, or to desired doneness, 10 to 20 minutes.

Let lamb rest for 15 minutes, then slice into 8 chops per rack. Serve
4 chops to a plate (nap napped with a bit of sauce) with garlic mashed
potatoes and lightly cooked vegetables of your choice.

      ----POUTINES (DUMPLINGS----
1 cup flour salt
1 tablespoon baking powder cold water

"Although pot-en-pot contains the same ingredients as fricot, the
method of preparation is signficantly different. The most commonly
used meats for this dish are chicken and hare but beef, pork, duck or
goose may also be used. In Cheticamp and on the Magadalen Islands,
pot-en-pot is called Etouffrage."

POULTINES BLANCHES: In a bowl, mix flour with salt and baking powder.
Gradually add cold water to the dough as one would when making
biscuits. Roll the dough fairly thin, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares and
place in fricot or other dish. Cut the meats into pieces. Place the
pieces in a large pot with the salted water and bring to a boil.
Simmer until the meat is tender. Remove the meat from the pot,

Poultry Sausages-Information

makemeat

1  text

When one thinks of sausage, the meat that ordinarily comes to mind is pork,
sometimes beef, but usually never meat that comes from anything that has
wings and feathers. There are probably more recipes dealing with what you
can do with whole poultry or poultry pieces, especially chicken, than with
any other kind of meat. But sausage? Why not? Poultry is one of the most
heathful foods around. Ounce for ounce, it is a treasure house of protein
and minerals and an absolute bargin when one compares the proportion of
lean to fat meat. Chicken and turkey especially are recommended for people
on low fat and/or low calorie diets. All poultry has the added advantage of
being a rather bland meat. This means we can do just about anything to it
to make it taste as we please. One person who had studied the possibilities
of what can be done with poultry is Dr. Robert C. Baker of the New York
State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University. Dr
Baker is the inventor of the so-called "chicken dog." In an attempt to fine
new uses for poultry, especially laying hens past their prime, Dr. Baker
and his colleagues found that one can do just about anything with chicken
and turkey that one can do with red meat. And poultry has the advantage of
being cheaper and lower in fat than red meat. Lest anyone doubt that a
chicken dog can taste like a "real" hot dog, sensory analysis of products
developed by Dr. Baker and his colleagues has proven that people are just
as apt to like a product made from chicken or turkey meat, even though it
it may be a traditionally red meat product. The proliferation ath the
corner deli of things like "turkey salami", "turkey pastrami", or "chicken
bologna", are proof that the public is readily willing to accept these
products made from poultry. Large companies would not invest the capital
necessary to produce these products if the public did not accept them.
Although Dr. baker's work extends beyond what the home sausage maker might
find valuable, it does open up possibilities that anyone with a food
grinder and a source of poultry will find exciting.

Because everyone's tastes are different, these recipes are meant to be
guides or starting points for the home sausage maker. Generally speaking, a
larger proportion of dark meat (or even all dark meat), produces a somewhat
more pleasing sausage than a predominantly white or all white meat. Dark
meat has a slightly highefr fat content whick a succesful sausage needs.
Remember, were talking chicken and turkey here, so the fat content is
already at bargin basement levels. As we noted earlier, poultry tends to be
a rather bland meat. Generally speaking, a sausage made from chicken or
turkey will need a little more spice than would a similar sausage made from
red meat. When making poultry sausages for the first time, use these
recipes as a guideline, but don't be afraid to be creative. Like more
fennel in your Italian sausage? More garlic in your kielbasa? Try it,
you'll probably like it! One final word: what about skin and added fat?
Commercial sausages made from chicken and turkey meat do contain the skin
and fat normally found on a whole bird. The inclusion of these two
ingredients improve both taste and texture. Generally, I have found that
the addition of some skin greatly improves the sausage. Since we are
talking about an essentially lean meat to begin with, the addition of a
small amount of fat seems an acceptable price to pay for a more palatable
sausage. But the decision is yours. If you are willing to sacrifice
something in the way of taste and texture for an even leaner product, go
right ahead. In the recipes that follow, when a recipe specifies, fo
rexample, 4 lbs. of chicken meat, it presumes that about fifteen percent of
that is skin and fat. Experiment with the proportions to suit you and your
family's individual tastes and needs. After all, isn't that one of the
reasons you are making your own sausage to begin with?

Prairie Dog Bat Masterson

meats

1 x no ingredients

Bat Masterson was one of the early law officers of Dodge City, Kansas and a
great friend of Wyatt Earp.  Bat was an excellent gunfighter. He was a
short, stubby man with a friendly homespun appearance that made him look
like anything but a gunfighter.  In later years he became a New York sports
writer.  He was not a heavy drinker.  He preferred lemon pop to alcoholic
drinks and drank large quantities of it. His favorite foods were cold
tongue sandwiches and wiener sandwiches. Bat created a wiener sandwich
which became well known throughout the Old West and was justly though of as
a real delicacy. Everyone called it a Prairie Dog. It is one of the
greatest wiener recipes ever made and will be remembered long after Bat's
gun deeds are forgotten. Here is the original recipe:

Take a wiener and slit it open lengthwise.  Take ground sage and rub plenty
of it into the slit and onto the sides of the slit.  Place the wiener in an
oven and broil until done.  Take a bun and on one side of it put mustard
and thinly sliced dill pickles. On the other side sprinkle it well with
Worcestershire sauce.  The sage, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce blend
trogether to give you a sanwhich with a wonderful taste. Be sure to try
this famous sandwhich at your first opportunity. It makes the usual catsup
and mustard wiener sandwich taste very poor in comparison.

Prime Rib

main dish, beef

1  4 rib standing rib roast

Before you start preparing this recipe you need to know that it will
create a considerable amount of smoke in your house during the early
stages of preparation.  Preheat your oven to 500oF and verify with an
oven thermometer that your temperature is correct. While oven is
preheating let your prime rib stand at room temperature for at least
1-1/2 hours, longer if possible to allow the inside of the roast to
warm up as this will effect the cooking by this technique. Place the
roast in a baking pan on a flat rack.  Place roast in the preheated
500oF oven for 5 minutes per pound. ONCE YOU HAVE PLACED THE ROAST IN
THE OVEN YOU MUST, MUST, MUST LEAVE THE OVEN DOOR CLOSED. DO NOT OPEN
THE OVEN DOOR FOR ANYTHING. After cooking for 5 minutes per pound,
turn off the oven. Continue to leave the OVEN DOOR CLOSED.  Let the
roast set in the hot oven for 2 hours, with the DOOR CLOSED. The
roast is ready to carve when it comes out of the oven since the
juices have been reabsorbed while the roast has been setting in the
oven. Carve and serve. Bon a Petite. From: Melinda Lee, KNX Food News

Prime Rib #2

main dish, beef, party

1  salt
1  pepper
1  garlic powder
1  rib roast

Preheat  oven at 500 degrees for a minimum of 20 minutes. Season the
prime rib to taste (salt, pepper, garlic pow- der), put in preheated
oven and roast for 5 minutes per pound. Turn oven off and leave roast
in there for two hours.  DO NOT OPEN OVEN FOR ANY REASON, until the
two hours are up. This makes a very rare, very juicy, prime rib with
a crusty outside. (As I said,  this method applies  to any beef
roast, but it must be AT LEAST 5 pounds.  2. (This is for a 4 rib
roast). Bring roast to room temperature. Rub fat (not flesh) with
salt and pepper. Stand roast on its bones, fatty side up, in a
shallow roasting pan and put it in preheated 350 oven. Time it:
calculate 17 minutes of cooking time per 1 lb. of roast that is to be
well done on the outside and very rare inside--so that it can be
allowed to stand for 15 min- utes out of the oven before it is
carved. This gives the juices a chance to settle and makes carving
easier. If you are using a meat thermometer, insert it so that the
point is in the center of the meat, not touching the bone. For very
rare meat, the internal temperature should read 125 degrees.
Remember, the roast contin- ues to cook after it is taken out of the
oven.

Prime Rib (Syd)

meats

12 lb standing rib roast

Many cooks think there is some special preparation for this popular
restaurant meal but there really is nothing special in preparing
prime rib. Many times your local grocery store will have standing rib
roast on sale at lower prices than ground beef.  Preheat oven to
325øF. Place the roast on a rack in a 9-1/2" X 13" baking dish with
the fat side up. Insert a meat thermometer into the fat side so the
point of the thermometer is in the middle of the roast and not
touching any bone or large pieces of fat. Bake the roast for 25
minutes per pound or until the meat thermometer reads 165øF.  The
roast will be pink in the middle. That's all there is to making prime
rib. If you have not tried this wonderful treat at home, I encourage
you to do so.  It tastes even better at home than in the restaurant.

Prosciutto

meats

1  text only

Prosciutto is unsmoked, salted, and cured ham.  Perhaps the best and
best-known prosciutto of Italy is produced in the hills of Langhirano
just outside Parma.  This prosciutto, just like parmigiano-reggiano,
is produced under struck regulations by the Consortium of Producers
of _Prosciutto di Parma_.  Only the best-quality pigs are used for
this prosciutto, and they are fed with a special high-protein diet.
_Prosciutto di Parma_ is now available for the first time in this
country.
It has a lovely dark pink color with just a bit of marbling of fat
and it is deliciously sweet.  This ham is widely used in Italian
cooking.  Sliced prosciutto, tightly wrapped in plastic, can be kept
in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 days.  After that it will dry out.  Do
not freeze prosciutto.

_Prosciutto di Parma_ is sold with or without its large central bone.
American-made prosciuttos such as Volpi, Daniele, and Citterios are
good substitutes.

1/2 small cabbage
2  limes
2 small turnips
1 large carrot

"Puchero is to Mexican cooking what Pot-au-Feu is to French. The
difference lies in Puchero's imaginative combination of vegetables
and fruits. Since it is even more delicious the second day, this
recipe will make an ample amount to serve 8 for dinner, with some
left over for lunch the following day."

Place the chick peas in a kettle, cover with broth, and soak
overnight.

Cut the lamb and beef into 2-inch cubes, cut the chicken into serving
pieces, and dice the ham.  Peel and slice the onion and garlic.
Combine the drained chick peas, all the meats, the veal knuckle,
onion, garlic, and salt in a large soup kettle.  Cover with 2 quarts
of cold water and bring to a full boil.  Skim off the froth. Lower
the heat, cover, and simmer for
45    minutes.

Cut the cabbage into eight wedges. Peel and slice the turnips and
carrot. Slice the zucchini. Peel and dice the sweet potatoes. Cut the
corn from the cob.  Add the cabbage, turnips, carrot, zucchini, sweet
potatoes, and corn to the kettle. Cover and simmer about 20 minutes
or until meats and vegetables are tender.

Peel the boiled white potatoes and cut into thick slices. Peel
bananas and cut into 2-inch slices. Saute potatoes, sprinkled with
crushed coriander seeds and pepper in oil. Remove the potato slices
with a slotted spoon. Keep warm.  In the same oil saute the bananas
until golden. Keep warm with the potatoes.

Peel, core, and slice the pears and peaches.  Put in a small pan with
a little water and poach for 10 minutes. Do not overcook. Drain the
fruit.

Adjust the seasonings. Serve each bowl of soup with the juice from
one lime wedge and a Tbsp. of Guacamole.

1  chunks
1  green pepper -- seeded
4  sweet chile peppers --
1  seeded
2  onion -- peeled
4  cloves garlic -- peeled

1 can green peas
1/2 lb potatoes -- cubed
12  olives -- pimiento stuffed
1 tablespoon capers
1/2 cup seeded raisins --
1  (optional)
1/2 teaspoon salt

I love Puerto Rican Food!... It's usually simple, yet rich with lots
of cilantro and garlic!!.  Enclosed are examples of 4 dishes that can
be simplified to taste. I always add mucho mas cilantro, peppers and
garlic with fresh ingredients (I never used canned foods).

I prefer to also add a pinch of red chili powder just to make it
interesting (not a traditional ingredient in Puerto Rican food).

In a large heavy kettle, brown meat in oil.

Add green pepper, sweet chili, onions, cloves, cilantro, vinegar (or
lime juice), oregano, tomato sauce, bay leaves, and salt. Mix and
bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 1 hour.

Add carrots to kettle.  Drain liquid from peas into kettle and mix
(reserve peas)   Bring rapidly to a boil, reduce to low, cover and
cook about 1 hr until meat is almost fork-tender..

Add potatoes, olives, capers, raisins, and 1/2 tsp salt, bring
rapidly to a boil,  reduce heat to low, cover and cook about 1 hour,
or until meat is fork-tender and  vegetables are done.

Ad reserved peas and mix.  Taste and adjust seasoning (uncover, and
boil to thicken sauce to taste).

Puschlaver Risotto

main dish, meats, vegetables

30 gm dried ceps or other mushroom
100 gm butter
1 single onion, chopped fine
1/8 teaspoon saffron, broken up small
1 deciliter red wine
350 gm risotto rice (arborio)
8 deciliter bouillon
100 gm grated cheese
250 gm veal, cut into thin strips
1 deciliter heavy cream
2 single tomatoes, skinned and cubed
1 single bunch parsley, chopped fine

Soak the mushrooms, then drain and dry well.  Reserve 2 dl of the
soaking liquid.  Melt 40 g of the butter in a pan: add the onion,
mushrooms, garlic and saute quickly; then add the red wine and lower
the heat so that it's partly absorbed.  Then add the rice and saffron
and stir well. Add the bouillon and the mushroom-water, stir, and
reduce heat to a simmer.
Cook slowly until the liquid is absorbed.  The rice should be al
dente. -- The butter and grated cheese are tossed in with the risotto
when it's complete.  -- Flour the veal lightly and saute it in more
butter; when done, lower the heat and add the cream, stirring
carefully. Make a "dent" in the middle of the risotto and ladle the
veal-and-cream mixture into this.  As a garnish, saute the tomatoes
and parsley in the rest of the butter, and scatter over the top of
the risotto.
Serve.

2 teaspoon cornstarch
2 tablespoon water
2 tablespoon sherry
4 tablespoon beef stock
2 slice ginger root

Cut the beef into small thin slices and rub these with the salt and
1/2 tablespoon of oil.  Mix the soy sauce, cornstarch, water, sherry
and stock in a bowl until well blended. Finely chop the ginger. Heat
the oil in a frying pan. When hot add the beef, spreading the pieces
out, and stir-fry them over a high heat for 1 minute. Add the ginger,

Rabbit A La Danielle

main dish, meats, ethnic

1 each large domestic rabbit
1 single salt
1 1/2  pints of whipping
1  cream
1 single pepper

Bake in an open casserole at 325F. for two to three hours.  The oval French
glazed earthenware casserole dishes are the best.  A large New Zealand Red
rabbit or one that size is the best.  This will fill a large casserole
dish.  The French remove the eyes, but leave the head attached. Sounds
gross to American tastes, but the head has some of the tenderest meat on
the rabbit and surprisingly a large amount. French children (mine as well)
fight over who gets the head.  Serve with roasted carrots and potatoes.
Danielle says that since she is not a good cook and hates to cook, this
dish is easy to prepare and serve. It still has that marvelous French flair
that is incomparable. Oh yes, serve also with crusty baguettes of French
bread and a very dry Chardonnay. Come to think of it, a good dry Cabernet
Sauvignon or Pinot Noir wouldn't be bad either.

Racituri-Pifte (Jelled Pigs Feet)

meats, ethnic

4 single pigs feet
1 tablespoon salt
2 single garlic cloves

Singe and thoroughly wash pigs feet. Place in pan with water to cover and
boil 15 min. Remove feet, rewash and place in pan, cover with 4 quarts
water and add salt. Boil slowly four hours or until meat falls off bones.
Skim off any foam that forms so broth remains clear.
Crush garlic and add to meat/water for last half hour of cooking. Remove
meat from bones if desired and strain juice over meat in flat plates. Put
in a cold place to jell. Serve sprinkled with sweet paprika or a little hot
pepper(I'd use dried cayenne or serrano, seeds an' all).
I've seen this served as a lunch with cheese & crackers and a ruby red
wine. Sounds ok to me!

Rack Of Lamb Breadbin

lamb

1  rack of lamb, about 5-6 lb
3/4 cup fresh garlic cloves, peeled
1/2 cup olive oil
1  juice of 4 lemons
3 tablespoon dry mustard
2 tablespoon bouquet garni
1 tablespoon tarragon

Plan ahead if you want to try this lamb dish.  It is best if marinated for
about four days in the refrigerator.  For extra browning, run it under the
broiler for a few minutes just before serving.

Have the butcher cut thru the chine bone so meat can be carved into
individual chops at the table and trim off fat around ends of ribs and
around kidney area.

Combine garlic and all remaining ingredients in food processor bowl or in
blender and process until liquefied.  Place roast in large plastic bag,
add marinade, spreading it all over roast and in between cuts made by
butcher.  Seal bag and refrigerate at least 2 days.  To roast, remove from
bag, place in roasting pan and insert meat thermometer in thickest part of
meat.  Roast at 450 degrees until thermometer registers "medium" for beef.
The lamb will be medium rare at this point.  If you wish to have it done
more, follow thermometer accordingly.

Rack Of Lamb Dijon

meats

1  rack of lamb; medium
1  dijon mustard
1  italian bread crumbs

Have the butcher take off the chine bone--or at the very least score
it through so that the chops can be cut. The ends of the chops should
be 'Frenched"...so you can see the bone. Put dijon all over the
lamb...coat it well.  Pat the bread cumbs on top of the mustard, so
that they adhere. particularly important on the rounded side...the
top. Place lamb in a pre-heated over...450 degrees.  Roast for about
35 minutes. This will give you a RARE lamb rack...the only way as far
as I am concerned. Rest for 10 minutes and serve. Will serve two, or
one very hungry person. Recipe was adapted from FINALLY   MICHAEL'S

Racks Of Lamb With Lemon & Mint

meats

2  racks of lamb (ea.3/4 lb.)
1  lemon mint marinade:
2 tablespoon chopped fresh mint (or
1  1 tsp dried)
1 teaspoon grated lemon rind
2 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1  pinch of pepper

paring knife, cut line across rack where meaty portion begins, about 3
inches down from rib ends. Cut off layer of fat between line and rib
ends.

exposed rib bones clean, removing any remaining meat and fat. Trim
fat from meaty portion of ribs to 1/8 inch thickness, lifting away
fat as you work.

With rib ends up, press racks together to interlink bones. Separate
bases about 1 inch to stabilize; place in shallow dish.

LEMON MINT MARINADE:  Whisk together mint, lemon rind and juice, oil
and pepper; brush over lamb.  Let stand at room temperature for 30
minutes.

Place lamb on greased rack in roasting pan; drizzle with any remaining
marinade.  Cover exposed ribs with foil to prevent charring. Roast in
450øF oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 325øF; roast for 40 minutes
or until meat thermometer registers 140øF for rare and 150øF for
medium-rare.

PHULKA PUFFED WHOLE WHEAT BREAD

to make 5 six inch breads

1 cup flour 1/4 to 1/2 cup water

Place the flour in a deep bowl, make a well in the center and pour in
1/4 cup of the water. With your fingers or a spoon blend the water
into the flour. Then knead or beat the mixture together vigouously
until it can be gathered into a compact ball. If the dough crumbles
add up to 1/4 cup more water, 1 tbsp at a time until the particles
adhere. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough by folding it
end to end, then pressing it down and pushing it forward several
times with the heal of your hand. Repeat for 10 minutes, or until the
dough is smooth and elastic. Again gather it into a ball, place it in
a bowl and drape a dampened kitchen towel over the top. Set aside and
let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature. To
shape each phulka, devide the dough into 5 equal portions and form
each one into a ball. On al lightly floured surface, roll each ball
intop a round about 6 inches in diameter. As you proceed, cover the
phulkas with a damp kitchen towel. Heat an ungreased 10 to 12 inch
skillet with a nonstick finish or a well seasoned cast iron skillet
or griddle until it is hot evough for a drop of water flicked into it
to splutter instantly. Place one of the phulkas in the pan and,
moving it about constantly with your fingers or the edge of a metal
spatula, cook kit for a minute or so, until the top begins to darken.
Turn the phulka over and cook for 1 minute longer, or until it is
lightly browned. Then, holding a folded linen kitchen towel in one
hand, press it down gently but firmly on the bread. Lift your hand
away and the phulka should puff almost instantly. Remove the towel
and slide the phulka onto a heated plate. Serve the Phulka warm as a
mealtime bread If requested I have recipe for following Indian

Rare Prime Rib

meats

12 lb prime rib roast
1  salt to taste
1  black pepper to taste

Remove roast from the refrigerator ast least two hours before
beginning to cook. Place in a shallow roasting pan and liberally
sprinkle fatty top with salt and pepper. Pat in. To protect the oven
from spattering fat, place a tent of aluminum foil loosely over the
top of the meat. Preheat the oven to 500*F and when preheated place
roast in oven and roast for the times listed below. THE TIMES MUST
ABE ADHERED TO EXACTLY. Set a timer to remind you as a few minutes of
overcooking will ruin the roast. When the cooking time ends, turn off
the oven but DO NOT open the door. Allow the roast to remain in the
oven for at least 1 hour or until the oven is luke warm, which occurs
in about 2 hours. The roast will be beautifully rare inside and
retain a crunchy outside and an internal heat suitable for serving
for 2 hours. The roasting time works out to 15 minutes per rib or
approximately 5 minutes per pound. NOTES:  1. For a 2 rib roast
weighing 41/2 -5 lbs. allow 25 to 30 minutes at 500*F
2. For a 3 rib roast weighing 8-9 lbs. allow 40-45 minutes at
500*F
3. For a 4 rib roast weighing 11-12 lbs. allow 55-60 minutes at
500*F
4. Have your butcher prepare the roast by removing the chine
bone and cutting the meat from the bones. Then return the chine bone
and the meat to its original shape and tie the roast to hold it
together. This will facilitate your carving.
5. A small end Prime rib is always the best.

Real Irish Stew

lamb, irish

1 1/2 lb mutton, cut into pieces
1  parsley sprigs
6  carrots, sliced
2 lb potatoes
1  salt and pepper
1 lb onions

Place meat and vegetables in saucepan and cover with cold water. Add
salt and pepper as required and flavor with a few parsley sprigs and
add carrot slices. Slowly bring to a boil and skim off the top.
Simmer over a very low heat for approximately 2 hours or until the
meat is tender. Note:You can probably substitue lamb for the mutton
and not need to cook as long. Also this kind of dish is good for
buffets as soups and stews keep well and don't suffer for extended
simmering.......8-)

Red Potato Salad With Bacon

meats, salads, vegetables

      ----WHOLE FAMILY COOKBOOK----
2 lb red potatoes; small
1/3 lb bacon; diced
1 cup yellow onion; peeled, thinly
4  scallions; chopped
1/4 cup mayonaise
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard (coleman's)
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
1/2 cup olive oil
1  salt
1  black pepper; feshly ground
2  eggs; hard boiled

Wash the potatoes and drain.  Using a paring knife, trim a band of
the peel about 1/2 inch wide (depending on the size of the potatoes)
around the circumference of each potato. This will form an attractive
"belt". Boil the trimmed potatoes gently in ample, lightly salted
water until just tender. The potatoes are done as soon as they pierce
easily with a sharp knife. Carefully drain, spread on a tray, and
allow to cool. Cook the bacon in a medium sized frying pan until
almost crip. Add the onion and cook until limp. Drain off any excess
fat. Place the cooled potatoes in a bolw along with the cooked bacon
and onion, and the scallions. In another bowl, blend together the
mayonnaise, dry mustard, vinegar, oil and salt and pepper to taste
add to the bowl of potatoes and toss together. Fold in the
hard-boiled eggs. Cover and refrigerate. Serves 4 to 6.

Rich Venison & Mushroom Stew

main dish, meats

2 lb good stewing venison - (trimmed wei; ght)
1  onion
3/4 lb small flat mushrooms
2 1/2 fl oz red wine vinegar
2 1/2 fl oz water
3/4 pint (scant) beef or game stock
1  butter
1  oil
1  flour
1  sugar
1  bay leaves
      ----FOR THE FORCEMEAT BALLS----
8 oz fresh breadcrumbs
8 oz grated suet
2  lemons (grated zest only)
1 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice
1 large egg
3 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley

Cut the venison into large chunks and marinate for about 24 hours in the
water and vinegar with 2 bay leaves and plenty of pepper.

Make the forcemeat mixture, seasoning it well and binding it with the
lightly beaten egg.  Shape into 24 small balls, fry briskly until golden-
brown and crisp and reserve.  Then fry the mushrooms hard in a very little
hot fat.  Remove and reserve separately.

Drain and dry the meat well, reserving the marinade.  Dust the venison with
well-seasoned flour and brown and seal in batches. Transfer it to a 4 pint
flameproof casserole; ideally this should be no more than 8 inches in
diameter across the top.  Chop the onion finely and fry gently. Sprinkle on
2 tablespoons flour, pour on the marinade liquid and the stock over the
meat and season with salt, pepper, 1/2 teaspoon sugar and 2 bay leaves.

Bring to a bare simmer, cover tightly and cook over the lowest possible
flame (or in a low oven if you prefer) until the meat is deliciously tender
and the gravy is dark and rich.  Shoulder meat may need as little as 1 1/2
hours, lesser cuts of meat will need considerably more. Stir occasionally
to prevent sticking.  When ready, remove the bay and check seasoning. Cool
and refrigerate overnight if not to be served on the same day.

To finish the dish, bring everything back to room temperature.  Add the
prepared mushrooms to the stew, pushing them well down into the gravy, then
cover the surface with the forcemeat balls and bake - without a lid to keep
the forcemeat balls really crisp - at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6 for about 25
minutes.

Right In The Oven Smoking

meats, info

3 tablespoon liquid smoke
1  6 qt pan or casserole with tight fi; tting lid
1  steamer or rack that fits inside pa; n
1  meat or fish to smoke

Now you can have the smoked effect and similar flavor without a fire
using your oven.  The technique is called oven-smoking and the
ingredient that makes it possible is "liquid smoke". This preparation
flavors foods, but it does not preserve them as true smoking-brining
folled by partial drying does.

The pale liquid, slold in small bottles alongside seasoning sauces in
the supermarket, is actually made from smoke. As the wood burns, the
smoke is captured intubes, where it cools and condenses, and then is
filtered and bottled.  It comes in several flavors.

Oven smoking is actually a combination of baking and steaming. The
equipment is simple:  a f to 6 quart pan with a tight lid and a rack
that will fit inside. All you do is pour a small amount of liqid
smoke in the pan, set foods you want to smoke on the rack, cover and
bake. As the smoke evaporates it permeates the food. A little goes a
long way and it tastes stronger when the food is cold.

Oven smoked foods will keep well for a few days.  To store wrap
securely to prevent smoke flavor from permeating other items in your
refrigerator.

Here are some foods you can oven smoke:

Roast Beef & Yorkshire Pudding

breads, meats

4 lb rib roast
2 tablespoon oil
      ----YORKSHIRE PUDDING----
3/4 cup flour salt
3/4 cup milk
1 tablespoon milk
2  eggs

"It used to be the custom to cook Yorkshire Pudding and the Roast
Beef in the same pan. Although it is rarely done today, Yorkshire
Pudding still taste best if it is cooked in the fat that the meat has
been cooked in, so that it absorbed with meat juices. Serve with
Horseradish Sauce." Preheat the oven to 450F. Place the beef fat side
up in the roasting pan and coat with oil. If you like your beef rare,
it should cook for 1 1/4 hours and the meat thermometer should
register between 130F and 140F. If you prefer it medium to well done,
it should cook for 1 1/2 hours and a meat thermometer should register
between 150F and 160F. Baste the meat frequently while it is cooking.
Meanwhile, prepare the batter for the Yorkshire Pudding. Sift the
flour and salt into a mixing bowl. Make a well in the centre and add
milk and the water gradually, beating well after each addition with a
wooden spoon.
In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until fluffy. Add them to the
flour mixture. Beat until bubbles rise to the surface. Pour the
batter in a pitcher and refrigerate for 1/2 hour.
When the meat is cooked, remove it from the pan and place it on a
warm platter. Cover with aluminum foil and let it stand 25 minutes
before carving.
Reheat the batter and pour it quickly into the still hot cooking
pan. Bake it in the oven for 10 minutes at 450F. Then reduce the heat
to 350F and cook it an additional 15 minutes, until it is well risen
and has turned a golden brown. (Do NOT open the oven door while it is
cooking.) Serve immediately from the pan in which it has been cooked.

Roast Beef In The Clay Pot

beef, clay cooker

5 lb rolled roast of beef
1 teaspoon salt
1  pepper; to taste
6 small white onions; peeled
6 medium carrots; peel/slice lengthwis
6 small new potatoes; unpeeled
6 large mushrooms; sliced
3 tablespoon parsley, fresh; chopped
2  bay leaves; whole
1 teaspoon arrowroot; approximately

"Roast beef steamed in the clay pot is a different experience. The
meat has a delightful texture you can't find in beef cooked any other
way. But one word of caution: it's going to take much less time to
cook than you think. Rely strictly on your meat thermometer. The size
of both the pot and roast will make a difference. If you like your
beef rare, check the thermometer after 40 minutes. You can omit the
vegetables if you don't want a complete dinner."

Presoak your largest clay pot, top and bottom, in water fifteen
minutes.

Trim fat from beef and rub with salt and pepper. Place beef in pot and
insert meat thermometer. Add to pot all above ingredients, plus 1
teaspoon salt and dash of pepper.

Place covered pot in cold oven. Set temperature to 480 degrees. For
rare beef, check meat thermometer after 40 minutes. For medium beef,
check after 1 hour. For well-done beef--if you really want it that
way--check after 90 minutes.

Remove pot from oven when meat thermometer is almost up to
temperature. (Don't wait until it's right on the nose or it will be
overdone.) Pour liquid into saucepan, bring to boil and thicken with
about 1/2 teaspoon arrowroot.

Roast Possum

meats

1  possum, whole, uncleaned
1  onion, large, chopped
1 tablespoon bacon fat
1  possum liver
1 cup bread crumbs
1 teaspoon red pepper, chopped
1  worcestershire sauce, dash
1  egg, hardboiled, finely chop
1  salt to taste

Possums are roasted with hide on, so prepare a large pot of scalding
hot water. Dip possum in it for a few minutes, then remove the hair
by scraping with a dull knife, as you would scrape a hog. If some
hair comes off hard, dip again in scalding (not hard-boiling) water.
Wash with soap and water, then remove entrails, keeping washed liver.
Remove head and tail (some people keep the head on). Soak in cold
water to which is added 1 cup salt. Drain and rinse with boiling
water. Stuff with possum stuffing, close the opening, and roast in
black iron pot with a little water for 1-1/2 hours at 350. Baste
often. SEE possum stuffing recipe. Add sweet potatoes 1 hour before
possum is done.

Roast Rabbit Or Hare  _llb_

main dish, meats, game

1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1 teaspoon marjoram
4 lb to 5 lb dressed hare  -or-
2 each cottontails
1/4 lb salt pork; sliced
1/4 cup dry red wine
1 tablespoon vinegar
1 small onion; chopped
1/2 cup beef or chicken stock
1 tablespoon beach plum or red currant jelly
1/2 cup heavy cream
1  pepper
1 teaspoon flour stirred with.......
2 tablespoon water

...Rabbits and especially the large hares look appetizing roasted whole...
... In this recipe one may marinate hare for two to three days with your
favorite marinade. If you do marinate, use the strained marinade instead of
the wine and the vinegar.

Mix the salt, pepper, and the two herbs and rub it all on and inside the
hare. Truss the front legs and in doing so, tie on slabs of salt pork over
the saddle [Note this step adds fat to help soften the meat].
In a shallow roasting pan, roast the hare uncovered for about 30 minutes
in a 450 degree F oven. Turn the oven down to 350 degrees and roast another
45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the hare and keep warm.
Place the roasting pan and contents over a medium heat. Add the wine,
vinegar, onion and stock and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes. Add the jelly,
cream, pepper (taste for salt) and quickly dissolve jelly. Stir in the
flour and water paste and let it thicken a bit before serving in a
sauceboat.

Roast Venison

main dish, meats

4 lb venison roast(elk,moose,deer
2 tablespoon flour
2  cloves garlic (minced)
2 tablespoon brown sugar
1 teaspoon prepared mustard
1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup vinegar or lemon juice
1 large onion (sliced)
1 can tomatoes (14 oz can)
1  marinade
1/2 cup vinegar
2  cloves garlic (minced)
1 tablespoon salt
1/2 cup red wine
1  cold water to cover meat

Let the meat stand at room temperature for 8 hours then marinade the
venison over night in the refrigerator. This opens the pores of the
meat when at room temp and when cooling will draw in the marinade.
Season with salt, roll in flour and brown in hot skillet. Place in
crock-pot cooker and add remaining ingredients. Cover and cook on low
10 to 12 hours.

MARINADE: Mix ingredients together in a bowl just large enough to
cover venison with water. No need to stir this marinade. Use for
"red" meats or game birds.

Roasted Pig

meats, misc, native american

1 x no ingredients

A pig about 3 weeks old is the best. It should be killed in the morning, if
it is to be eaten at dinner.  Make a stuffing with about 6 powdered
crackers, 1 T. sage, 2 T. sweet marjoram, half a pint of cream, 2 eggs, and
a little salt and pepper.  Mix these well together, and let it stew about
15 minutes.  Then wash the pig in cold water; cut off the petti-toes,
leaving the skin long to wrap around the ends of the legs; then fill the
belly with the stuffing and sew it upp. The liver and heart should be
boiled with 5 or 6 ppeppercorns and chopped fine for the gravy. When the
pig is put down to roast, put in a pint of water, and a T. of salt; when it
begins to roast, flour it wll, and baste it with the drippings and continue
to do so until it is done. It requires constant care. A small pig will
roast in 3 hours.

Roasted Spare Ribs (Pei Quot)

meats, chinese

2  to 2-1/2 lbs. spare ribs
1 tablespoon black beans
2  thin slices ginger root
1  scallion
1 centiliter garlic
4 tablespoon soy sauce
4 tablespoon honey
3 tablespoon hoisin sauce
1 tablespoon rice wine
1 cup chicken broth
2 tablespoon oil

PREPARATION:

Remove as much fat and gristle as you can from the meat and cut apart
into individual ribs.  Wash black beans and mash. Mince ginger root
and the scallion. Smash, peel, and mince garlic. Mix black beans,
ginger root, garlic.  Mix soy sauce, honey, hoisin sauce, and rice
wine.

COOKING:

Heat oil in a large deep skillet or wok, and add ginger root and the
scallion.  Stir-fry for 1 minute. Add the ribs and stir-fry for 5
minutes. Add soy sauce mixture; stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the
chicken broth. Stir ribs to coat them with the sauce and bring to a
boil. Reduce heat to low. Cover, and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring
the ribs every 5 or 6 minutes to coat them with the sauce.  Remove
the ribs from the skillet and spread in a large shallow roasting pan,
in one layer if possible. Roast in a 350-degree oven for 10 minutes.
If ribs are not dry in 10 minutes, roast a little longer.  They may

NOTE: This sauce is quite spicy.  If you prefer a milder dish, omit
the hoisin sauce.

buttuckes to the neck. The deboining is easier if the hen is split on
one

side of the backbone, not down the middle. Lay the hen flat on the
board to expose the backbone and rib cage. Pull out the cartiledge in
center. Carefully pull the rib cage out, working the knife between
the rib and the flesh.  Also remove the wishbone. Do not remove bone
from the wings or thighs or legs. Wash and dry hens and refrigerate,
covered, until ready to use.

GAME HEN STOCK: Press the onion, cut side down, on a hot surface
until well browned, Place onion and bones in baking pan and bake at
350 degrees F for 20 minutes.    Combine celery, water, bouillon, and
baked bones in a saucepot.  Boil, uncovered, to reduce liquid to 1/2.
Set aside.

VELOUTE SAUCE: Heat butter in small saucepan and blend in flour. Stir
in stock gradually.  Cook and stir with a whisk until thickened and
smooth. Ass remaining ingredients, Set aside.

STUFFING FOR GAME HENS: Put bread slices in blender or food processor
with steel blade and process to make medium crumbs.  Set aside.
Remove skins from the sausage and crumble. Fry in a skillet until
browned. Add celery and onions and continue cooking until celery and
onions are tender. Add bread crumbs and remaining ingredients and mix
throughly. Set aside.

CLAY FOR SEALING POTS: Mix dry ingredients. Mix food colouring with
ater.

gradually stir into the flour mixture until it reaches the
consistancy of a biscuit batter. Mix well and set aside.

TO ASSEMBLE THE DISH: Spread hens out flat, sink sides down. Divide
stuffing between hens, shaping stuffing into balls. Bring hens up
around the stuffing and shape into a ball. Heat Veloute Sauce and
pour into the clay pot. Lay hens, breast side up, into Veloute Sauce.
Cut each sausage into 3 pieces and place around hens. Cover and seal
edges of pot with clay. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 1 hour.

Roman Pie

main dish, meats, pasta

      ----FOR THE MEAT LAYERS----
1 lb cooked turkey or chicken *
1/4 lb cooked ham
1/4 lb cooked tongue
50 gm canned anchovy fillets
3/4 lb mushrooms
1 large bunch parsley
1  lemon juice
1  a few black olives
1  canned consomme **
      ----FOR THE PASTA LAYERS----
6 oz macaroni
12 1/2 fl oz milk
1/2 pint single cream
1 oz butter
1 oz plain flour
4 oz cheddar cheese
1 oz parmesan cheese

*Note: Weight given for turkey or chicken is skinned, boned weight. Goose,
pheasant and other birds can be used instead.

**Well-flavoured, clear stock and a little gelatine powder may be
substituted for canned consomme.

Make a smooth, rich sauce with the butter, flour, milk and cream. Let it
simmer for about 4 minutes.  Then, away from the heat, stir in the grated
Cheddar and Parmesan, a seasoning of nutmeg and some salt and pepper - but
go carefully with the salt in view of the cheeses and salted meats used in
this dish.  Let the sauce cool while you cook the macaroni in plenty of
salted water until al dente.  Plunge the pasta in cold water to arrest
cooking, drain well and stir it into the sauce.

Slice the mushrooms thickly and saute them well in a non-stick pan with no
fat.  Season them with about 1 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, plenty of pepper
and a little salt and allow to become cold.  Then cut the turkey meat into
pieces about the width and half the length of your little finger, and mix
the poultry and mushrooms together.

Cut the ham, tongue and drained anchovies into strips about the same length
as the poultry but considerably less wide.  Mix the anchovies, ham and
tongue with a good quantity of fairly coarsely chopped parsley.

Sprinkle about one third to half of the ham mixture over the base of a
shallow dish of 4 to 4-1/2 pint capacity.  Cover with half the macaroni
mixture, then all the turkey mixture, then the rest of the macaroni. Spread
each layer evenly and press down into the dish with a potato masher before
adding the next layer.  Cover and chill for 30 minutes.

Arrange the remaining ham mixture on top and scatter the olives to make a
decorative display of the pink, green and black ingredients. Press down
lightly then pour on enough barely melted consomme or cool jellied stock to
cover.

Cover the dish and refrigerate for a few hours until set.  Better still,
refrigerate Roman pie overnight to allow flavours to blend and mature, but
be sure to bring it back to room temperature at least two hours before
serving.

Ropa Veja (Trans." Old Clothes")

mexican, beef

4 lb boneless chuck roast
1 large white onion, thin sliced
1  sweet bell pepper, thinly sliced *
1 can beef broth (not condensed)

* (I'd personally substitute several roasted Anaheim or Poblano
peppers, but Bell would be a safer choice for the heat-shy)

Lay half the onions and peppers in a large heavy stewing pot. Add the
roast, and cover with the remaining peppers.

Add enough beef broth to come about halfway up the side of the roast.
Cover, and cook over medium-low heat, turning the roast occasionally,
until the meat is virtually falling apart (3- 4 hours). If you have a
crock pot, all day (without turning) is fine.

Remove the roast from the pot, pull off and discard any remaining
fat, and using a fork or your fingers, pull the lean meat into
shreds. Mix in the onions/peppers and enough of the de-fatted cooking
liquid to form a juicy, but not soupy mixture. Season to taste with
salt. This will reheat very well, or hold nicely in a chafing dish.

Use as a filling for soft or hard tacos (lowest in fat would be soft
tacos made with steamed or lightly heated corn tortillas).

Rouladen (Rolmups)

beef

3 lb top round steak, 1/2 thick
6 teaspoon german style prepared mustard
1/4 cup onion, finely chopped
6 slice bacon
3  dill pickles, rinsed in cold water
3 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 cup water
1 cup celery, coarsely chopped
1/4 cup leeks,white only, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon parsnip, scraped, finely chopped
3  sprigs parsley
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon flour

Pound steak to 1/4" thick. Cut into 6 rectangular pieces about 4
inches wide and 8 inches long. Spread each with a teaspoon of
mustard, sprinkle i with 2 teaspoons onion, and place a strip of
bacon down the center. Cut pickles in half lengthwise. Place one half
of a pickle across the short end of the rectangle. Roll meat up
jellyroll style around the pickle to form a cylinder. Tie rolls at
each end with kitchen cord.

On medium high setting, heat the vegetable oil in a heavy 10 to 12
inch skillet. Add the beef rolls and brown them on all sides,
regulating the heat so they color quickly and evenly without burning.
Transfer the rolls to a plate, pour the water into the skillet and
bring it to a boil, meanwhile scraping in any brown particles
clinging to the bottom and sides of the pan. Add the celery, leeks,
parsnips, parsley, and salt. Return the beef rolls to the skillet.
Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 1 hour, or until the meat
shows no resistance when pierced with a fork. Turn the rolls once or
twice during the cooking period. Transfer the rolls to a heated
platter, cover with foil to keep them warm. while you make the sauce.

Strain the cooking liquid left in the skillet through a fine sieve,
pressing down hard on the vegetables before discarding them. Measure
the liquid, return it to the skillet, and boil it briskly until it is
reduced to 2 cups. Remove from heat. Melt the butter in a small
saucepan over moderate heat, and when the foam subsides sprinkle in
the flour. Lower the heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the
flour turns a golden brown. Be careful not to let it burn. Gradually
add the reduced cooking liquid, beating vigorously with a whisk until
the sauce is smooth and thick. Taste for seasoning and return the
sauce and the rouladen to the skillet. Simmer over low heat only long
enough to heat the rolld through. Serve the rools on a heated platter
and pour the sauce over them. Rouladen are often served with red
cabbage and dumplings or boiled potatoes. NOTES : I sometimes make it
as written, but often omit the parsnips, celery and leek. I also have
a heavier hand with the onion. This recipe makes killer gravy for
mashed potatoes.

minutes or until the meat is fork-tender.

In a bowl, mix the 2 tablespoons of flour with the 1/2 cup of water
until smooth.  Stir into the meat along with the Worcestershire sauce
and the undrained mushrooms. Stir and cook until thickened, 2 to 3
minutes. (If making ahead for reheating later, do not add the sour
cream now. Reheat, then complete the recipe directions.)

Stir in the sour cream and heat gently just until the gravy simmers.
Sprinkle with parsley and serve over potatoes, noodles, or rice.

Russion Jewish Cabbage Rolls

main dish, meats, vegetables

1  large head of cabbage
1  large onion, chopped
6  small carrots
3  stalks celery
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup tomato juice
1 lb hamburger
2  slices bread
1  egg
1/4 cup water
2 can tomatoes
1 cup sugar
2  lemons
1  dash pepper

Core cabbage and place in large saucepan.  Cover cabbage with water
and boil until cabbage is softened. Drain off water. Set aside copped
onion, pared carrots, and cut celery stalks in halves. In a small
bowl, dampen bread with water.  Add hamburger, egg, salt and pepper.
Mix together well. Slice thick stem base off cabbage leaves. Place
some meat misture on leaf. Fold and roll, place seam side down in
saucepan. On top of cabbage rolls, place onions, carrots, and celery.
Pour tomatoes and tomato juice over all. Carmelize 1 cup sugar in
heavy skillet. Add to cabbage roll mixture. Juice 2 lemons and add as
final ingredient. Simmer 2 hours uncovered. This recipe says sauce
pan but I used a 13" cake pan. It doesn't specify degrees, so I
picked 350.  ???  The cake pan holds the rolls and then the carrots
and celery can be decorative by laying them horizontally,
alternating. It makes a pretty dish.  And it is good. Well worth the
effort.

Saddle Of Rabbit With Leeks & Rosemary

game

      ----MARINADE, RABBIT, AND SAUCE----
3 lb rabbit, use only the - saddle secti; on **
1 small carrot
1/2 medium onion
1  celery, stalk
1  garlic, clove, crushed
2  rosemary, fresh, sprigs
1 tablespoon oil, olive
2 tablespoon butter
1 1/3 cup wine, white
1 cup stock, rabbit or
1 cup bouillon, chicken
1 medium tomato, sliced
1  salt (to taste)
1  pepper (to taste)
      ----LEEKS----
2 medium leeks
1 tablespoon butter
1  salt (to taste)

** The "saddle of a rabbit" is the rabbit's back from the first
rib to the beginning of the legs.

Marinade: =========

Put the saddle of the rabbit in a small bowl with 1 cup of white
wine and 1 sprig of rosemary.  Chop the carrot, onion, celery, and
garlic add them to the marinade. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and
store in the refrigerator for 24 - 48 hours.  (The longer the better
for the flavor of the rabbit meat.)

Rabbit: =======

Preheat your oven to 450 F.

Remove the rabbit from the marinade and dry with a cloth. Salt
and pepper the rabbit.

In a medium roasting pan, add 1 tablespoon of butter and 1
tablespoon of olive oil.  Heat the mixture until the butter sizzles.

Place the rabbit in the pan, skin side up, and brown. Turn,
wrapping flaps around the filet to protect it, and cook until light
brown. Place the pan in the 450 F oven and cook for 10 minutes, until
medium rare. Baste often.

Add the vegetables from the marinade to the pan with the rabbit
and cook for another 5 minutes, basting and turning occasionally.

Remove the rabbit from the pan and place it aside in a warm
location. Trim the saddle flaps from the rabbit and chop the flaps
coarsely.

Sauce: ======

Return the chopped flaps to the pan with the vegetables. On the
stove top, saute briefly and skim the fat.

Deglaze the pan with 1/2 cup of wine, add the rabbit stock and
reduce by one-half.

Add the tomato and saute while stirring.  Strain the hot mixture
through a sieve, reserving the liquid (for sauce) and discarding the
vegetables. Add the butter to the liquid and whisk until smooth.

Leeks: ======

Julienne the leeks.  Rinse in cold water and drain well.

In a medium saute pan, add 1 tablespoon butter and leeks. Cook
slowly for 2 - 5 minutes.  Leeks should remain crisp. Adjust the
seasonings and set the leeks aside in a warm place.

Assembly: =========

Remove the filet of rabbit from the saddle.  Cut the saddle bone
crosswise and place one section on each of two plates. Surround the
saddle bones with leeks.

Cut the filet of rabbit into very thin slices lengthwise. Fan
slices on top of the leeks.

Cover with sauce, garnish with sprigs of rosemary. Serve
immediately.

Salt Cured Leg Of Lamb (Spekemat)

ethnic, lamb

3 lb salt
4 quart water (less if the leg is smaller)
1 tablespoon sugar
8 lb leg of lamb

You will need a large saucepan and a large crock. Dissolve the salt
in the water to make a brine.  Add the sugar. Put the leg of lamb in
a large crock and pour enough brine over it to cover it completely.
Put a weight on top to keep it underwater. Leave to take the salt in
a cool pantry (not below the freezing point, or the salting process
comes to a halt) for 2 weeks for a leg weighing 8 lbs (roughly 2 days
per pound of meat.)

Take the leg out after the allotted time and rinse thoroughly so that
you do not get too salty a rind. Hang it out to dry in a well-aired
cool pantry, wrapped in a loose bag of cheesecloth or muslin to
protect it from flies.  It will be dry, delicious, and ready to eat
in 2 to 3 months.

Serve, sliced very thin with a sharp knife, as part of an indoor
picnic meal, with sweet butter, fresh hard-boiled eggs, a sliver of
'geitost' (the Norwegian sweet brown cheese), and flat bread or
potato pancakes to wrap around each morsel.  A bowl of sour cream and
some fresh raspberries can follow as a replacement for Norwegian
cloudberries.

Yield:  3 to 5 lbs dried meat.  Allow 1/4 lb of dried meat per person.
Time:   Start 3 months before you need it; 20 minutes

Salt-Encrusted Ribeye Roast

beef

1  box; (3-pound) coarse kosher s
1 1/4 cup water
4  to 6lb well-trimmed beef ribeye roa; st, small end
1 tablespoon oil
2 teaspoon to 3 ts cracked blk. pepper

Preheat oven to 425 F. Line a shallow roasting pan with heavy-duty
aluminum foil. Combine salt and water; mix well. (Mixture may appear
dry but do not add more water.) In roasting pan, pat 1 1/2 cups salt
mixture into rectangular shape, approximately 1/2 to 1 inch larger
than the size of the roast. Brush the roast with oil; press pepper
evenly into surface. Insert ovenproof meat thermometer into thickest
part of roast, not resting in fat; center roast on salt layer.
Starting at the base of the roast, pack remaining salt mixture onto
sides and top of roast to encase roast in salt. (Some salt may fall
off, exposing small areas of the roast; this will not affect
cooking.) Do not add water or cover pan. Roast approximately 1 1/2 to
1 3/4 hours for medium rare, 1 3/4 to 2 hours for medium doneness.
Remove from oven when meat thermometer registers 130 F for
medium-rare, 145 F for medium. Remove pan with roast to cooling rack;
let stand 10 to 15 minutes. (Internal temperature will continue to
rise.) Remove and discard salt crust from roast, brushing away all
salt. Carve roast into 1/2-inch thick slices. Makes 6 to 8 servings.
Note: Salt crust should be slightly thicker at the base of the roast
than at the top. For easier packing of salt onto vertical surfaces,
use one hand to hold the salt crust in place while using the other
hand to pack on additional salt to cover. Salt crust should be
applied to roast just before roasting. A small amount of liquid may
collect in the bottom of the roasting pan during cooking.

Santa Fe Enchiladas

beef, tex mex

      ----SAUCE----
4 1/2 quart ; water
4 1/2 quart chicken stock
12  garlic clove; minced
2 cup gebhardt's chile powder
6 tablespoon bacon grease
35 oz tomato paste
3 teaspoon oregano
1/8 cup salt
      ----FILLING & TOPPING----
3  iceberg lettuce head; shredded
6 lb ricotta
6  onion, yellow; chopped
4 lb longhorn cheddar; shredded
2 cup longhorn cheddar; shredded
70  corn tortillas
35  egg; fried (sunny side up)
1  sour cream

Prepare the sauce first: Combine the water and stock in a saucepan.
Bring to a boil. Combine the chile powder, bacon fat and several
tablespoons of the hot stock from the other saucepan in a saucepan.
Cook, stirring steadily, over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes to
remove the raw taste from the chile powder. Stir in the tomato paste,
oregano, salt and garlic. Slowly stir in the remainder of the hot
stock from the other saucepan. Simmer over low heat for 20 minutes.
Adjust seasonings. Set aside.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Chop the onion and combine with the
ricotta in a bowl. Add the first measure of shredded Longhorn Cheddar.
Combine using a fork.

Heat some corn oil to 300 degrees in a deep skillet. Soften the
tortillas by passing them through the hot oil and pressing them
between towels to remove the excess oil.

Fill each tortilla with about 2/3 cup of the cheese and onion
mixture. Roll them up and place them, seam side down, in a lightly
buttered baking dish. Spoon on enough sauce to cover the tortillas.
Cover. Bake about 15 minutes. Uncover. Sprinkle the second measure of
shredded Longhorn Cheddar over. Return to the oven until the cheese
is melted (about 5 minutes). Cover with additional hot sauce. Serve
the tortillas in pairs. Place 1 fried egg on each pair of tortillas.
Garnish with shredded lettuce and sour cream.

Saturday Sancoche

beef

2 lb salt beef
2 lb mixed produce -- * see note
1/2 lb pumpkin
12  ochroes
6  green bananas
2 large potatoes
1/2 lb red beans -- or split peas
1 small onion -- per person
      Carrots Seasonings-----
1  garlic
1  scotch bonnet
1  green onions
1  thyme -- etc.

* yam, tannia, cassava, dasheen etc.

1. Put the salt beef to soak overnight. 2. Cut into small pieces and
cover with water (2 pints). 3. Bring to the boil and simmer gently
for 1
1/2    hours with beans or peas. 4. Add peeled and cut up
produce. 5. Add the onions (quartered), pumpkin (cut up), chopped
seasonings and ochroes. 6. Cook until vegetables are tender.

Tip #1:  You can add any type of meat to "beef" up this basically
meatless dish e.g. chicken, beef, pork etc. The only requirement is
that the pieces remain large otherwise they will disappear in the
soup. Tip #2: You can make some flour dumplings and plunk them in the
soup about 1/2 hour before you are ready. Tip #3: This soup gets very
thick very fast! A little water and butter will thin it out.

Sauces For Tongue

meats, sauces

      ----FOR SPICED KUMQUAT SAUCE----
5  kumquats
3  bay leaves
9  whole cloves; bruised
3/4 pint stock, pref. from tongue
1 large orange (juice only)
2 teaspoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon tarragon vinegar
3/4 oz butter
2 tablespoon flour
1  salt and pepper
4 tablespoon thick cream
      ----FOR PARSLEY & CAPER SAUCE----
1  garlic clove
1 oz parsely; chopped
1/2 oz chives
1 1/2 oz capers
1 small lemon; juice & zest only
8 fl oz oil
1  black pepper

FOR SPICED KUMQUAT SAUCE: Slice and remove the pips from the kumquats. Put
them into a pan with the bay leaves, cloves, stock, orange juice, lemon
juice and tarragon vinegar. Bring very slowly to the boil. Add a little
salt and pepper, cover and set aside for 20 minutes to infuse. Strain,
reserving the kumquats, liquid and spices separately. Make a smooth sauce
with the butter, flour and cooking liquid. Return spices to the pan and
simmer uncovered for 20 minutes. Stir regularly to prevent sticking and to
stop a skin from forming. By the end of this time, the sauce should be the
consistency of cream; if necessary boil it hard for 2-3 minutes to reduce
and thicken it a little. Strain to extract the spices, stir in the cream,
then the kumquats. Reheat gently, adding a few pinches of ground cloves,
more lemon juice and other seasonings to taste.

FOR PARSLEY & CAPER SAUCE:  Crush the garlic clove with a little salt. Then
process it briefly with the chopped parsley, chives and capers. Add the
lemon juice and zest, and the oil and whizz again until the mixture is
reduced to a thickened fragrant green puree. Add a coarse grinding of black
pepper and leave it for 1 hour or so to allow the flavours to blend.

Sauerbraten (Pot Roast)

beef, penn dutch

4 lb beef **
1 pint vinegar
1 single water
4 each bay leaf
12 each peppercorns, whole, black
4 each cloves, whole
1 each carrot, bunch
6 each onion
1 tablespoon sugar
12 each gingersnaps
1 single salt & pepper

** Use beef chuck, rump, or round. *** My notes: Watch meat while it
sits and add more vinegar and water (half of each) to keep meat
covered. A similar recipe in Bon Appetit used red vinegar and red
wine for the marinade and the beef was left in the refrigerator for
about 9 days. Wipe meat with damp cloth and then sprinkle thoroughly
with salt and pepper. Place meat in an earthen dish and add vinegar
and enough water to cover. Add the bay leaves, peppercorns and
cloves, and let stand tightly covered for 5 days in a cool place. Cut
carrots in strips; slice onions. Put meat in a dutch oven and brown
well on all sides. Add the carrots and onions and 1 cup of the spiced
vinegar. Cover tightly and cook over low flame about 3 hours or until
meat is tender. When meat is cooked, add the sugar and crumbled
ginger snaps and cook for 10 minutes. This makes delicious gravy. If
necessary, more of the spiced vinegar may be added. Source:

Sausage Casings

meats, makemeat

1 x no ingredients

Casings can be made from the intestines of beef, hogs, or sheep, the sheep
casings being used for small sausage like wiener-wurst, and the hog casings
for link sausages, and beef for Bologna, sausage, ham sausage, and blood
sausage.  Empty as soon as possible, turn inside out and scrape and clean
first the in and then the outside.  The cleaning is easy where one has
running water.  Soak 24 hours in lime water or lye water, turn, scrape and
rinse again, then salt down and use when needed. When one cannot clean the
casings, good substitutes can be made by stitching up tubes of new
unbleached muslin, 1 1/2 or 2 feet long, and 2 or 3 INCHES in diameter,
when filled.  When ready to hang away, rub the outside well with melted
lard, to exclude all air, and sprinkle with pepper.

Sausage: Casing Information & Preparation

makemeat

1  information only

Sausage has to be stuffed into something and that something is most often
the intestine of a hog, cow, or sheep. Before you gasp, rest assured that
these casings are kept scruplously  clean and are packed in salt which
keeps them fresh indefinitely. Natural casings come in an array of sizes,
ranging from under one inch to a lillt over four inches in diameter. The
smallest are usually sheep casings, 1/2" to 1 1/16" and the largest are
from beef, 2 1/2" to 4'. think of sheep casings as being the size of most
hot dogs, and beef casings the size of a large salami. The hog casings are
the most common since many sausages are made in the two inch diameter
range. Their sizes range from small (1 1/2 inch), medium (2 inch), and
large (2 1/2 inches). all should be kept refrigerated or frozen until ready
to use. You should be familiar with two other types of casing; collagen and
muslin. Collagen casings are made of natural, pure, edible protein. They
generally cost a little more than intestines, are sometimes a little harder
to find, but are convienent to use and usually can be substituted freely
for recipes calling for natural casings. Muslin casings can be purchased or
homemade and are sometimes used with summer sausage and salami. One needn't
be a Betsy Ross to stitch up a muslin casing. Just follow the instructions
given in Chapter 4.

Muslin Casing: You will need a piece of unbleached muslin about 12" long
and 8" wide. Fold the muslin lengthwise and tightly stitch a seam across
one of the short ends and continue along the open side. Keep the stitching
about an eight of an inch from the edge of the material. The short side of
the seam can be curved in a semi-circle to give the finished product a
rounded end. Turn the casing inside out so that the stitching is on the
inside. Set it aside until you are ready to stuff it.

Casing Preparation: Snip off about four feet of casing. (Better too much
than too little because any extra can be repacked in salt and used later.)
Rinse the casing under cool running water to remove any salt clinging to
it. Place it in a bowl of cool water and let it soak for about a half an
hour. While waiting for the casing to soak, you can begin preparing the
meat. After soaking, rinse the casing under cool running water. Slip one
end of the casing over the faucet nozzle. Hold the casing firmly on the
nozzle, and turn the cold water on, gently at first, and then more
forcefully. This procedure will flush out any salt in the casing and
pinpoint any breaks. Should you find a break, simply snip out a small
section of the casing. Place the casig in a bowl of water and add a splash
of white vinegar. A tablespoon of vinegar per cup of water is sufficient.
The vinegar softens the casing a bit more and makes it more transparent,
which in turn makes your sausage more pleasing to the eye. Leave the casing
in the water/vinegar solution until you are ready to use it. Rinse it well
and drain before stuffing.

Sauteed Breast Of Cornish Game Hen W/ Herb Sa

meats, poultry, game, rice

6  cornish game hens*
1  salt
1  pepper
1  flour
1/4 lb butter
1/4 cup vegetable shortening
1/2 cup cognac or brandy,warm
1 cup chicken stock,fat-free
1/8 teaspoon tarragon
1 pinch thyme
1 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon butter**
2 teaspoon flour**
1  salt
2 tablespoon parsley,minced
      ----WILD RICE----
1 cup wild rice
1  water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon butter

* - chicken breasts may be substituted. 3 whole chicken breasts would
provide 6 generous pieces.

** - mix butter and flour to a paste.

1. Have your butcher thaw Cornish hens if frozen. Remove legs and
wings. Cut back from breasts; skin and bone breasts. Cut each breast
in half. (Use legs for another meal. The backs and wings make a fine
stock or soup.) Season breasts lightly with salt and pepper and
dredge lightly with flour, pressing flour into breasts so that they
are completely coated. Shake off excess flour.

2. Melt the butter and shortening in a large heavy skillet over
moderate heat and cook the breasts lightly, a few at a time, removing
them as they turn firm and golden. When all are done, pour off and
discard the cooking fat.

3. Return the breasts to the skillet and place it over medium-high
heat. Pour in the cognac and ignite. Using a pronged kitchen fork,
turn the breasts in the flames for a few seconds, then remove the
skillet from the heat until the flames subside. Add the chicken
stock, tarragon, and thyme. Let simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until
breasts are tender. Remove them to a heated platter.

4. Reduce the cooking liquid to about half, then stir in the cream.
Add butter-flour mixture and cook the sauce over low heat until
smooth and thick. Correct seasonings with salt and stir in the
parsley. Pour some of the sauce over the breasts. Serve remaining
sauce separately.

5. Serve with wild rice.

*** WILD RICE ***

Place rice in a saucepan and cover by about 3 inches with cold water.
Place over medium heat and bring to full boil. Remove pot from heat,
let rice settle to bottom of pan, then gently pour off water. Again
cover rice with water. Add salt and butter and let simmer until
tender, usually about 30 minutes, depending on brand of rice. Drain
into colander. Place colander over a pan of simmering water to keep
hot until time to serve.

Sauteeing

meats, saute, info

1  no ingredients

To saute, heat a film of oil or clarified butter in a saute pan until
it smokes. (Clarified butter is heated until it separates and the
solids skimmed off). Add a thin slice of boneless meat, dredged in
flour, and cook just long enough to brown well on both sides. The
meat must be thin enough and tender enough to cook to doneness in
that amount of time. If it is thicker, it should be grilled, broiled,
or pan-fried.

1  unsweetened pie-sliced apples
2 tablespoon brown sugar
1  dumplings:
2 cup flour 1 egg
4 teaspoon baking 3 tablespoons
1  powder               melted butter
1/4 teaspoon pepper milk
1 teaspoon salt

Apples and buttons, this best-known of all Pennsylvania Dutch dishes
is called. Truly a meal in itself, it contains proteins, starch and
carbohydrates in a giant slab of ham surrounded by raised dumplings
and stewed apples.

To prepare, add apples and their liquid to ham and boil for one hour.
If dried apples are used, they should be soaked overnight first. Add
brown sugar. Prepare dumplings by sifting together flour, baking
powder, salt and pepper. Stir in well-beaten egg, butter and enough
milk to make a stiff but moist batter. Drop batter by large spoonfuls
into main dish, cover tightly and steam for about 20 minutes. Frozen
oven-ready yeast biscuits may be substituted for the dumpling batter.

Scottish Rabbit Curry

meats, ethnic

1  fresh rabbit
6 oz streaky bacon
6  button onions
4 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon flour
1 tablespoon curry-powder
1 teaspoon mushroom-powder
1  celery (optional)
1  coco-nut (optional)
1  salt and cayenne to taste
1 pint well seasoned stock

Choose a fat, fresh rabbit.  (To test it, examine the kidney.)  Cut it into
at least twelve pieces; brown these in butter, with onions. When browned,
if you wish delicate cookery, pour off the butter and add three-quarters of
a pint of well-seasoned stock, one large spoonful of curry-powder and one
of flour, six ounces of streaky bacon cut into half inch cubes, and also
half a dozen button onions. Season with a teaspoonful of mushroom powder.
Simmer this slowly for half an hour at least, stirring it. Add what more
seasonings you think required, as cayenne, a little turmeric, or some acid.
Pile up the pieces of rabbit and pour the sauce, which should be thickish
as in all curry dishes, over them. Serve with plain boiled rice in a
separate dish.

Fresh coco-nut is an excellent ingredient in mild curries.  Rasp and stew
it the whole time; we do not like green vegetables in curries though they
are sometimes used.  Mushrooms are an enrichment, celery is good, and onion
is indispensable.

Seven Step Jerky

meats, dehydrating

3 lb venison
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup worcestershire sauce
2 teaspoon msg
2 teaspoon seasoned salt
2/3 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoon onion powder
2/3 teaspoon pepper

Slice three pounds of venison into strips about 1/8 inch thick to
ensure total saturation of the meat while it's marinating. Partial
freezing beforehand aids in slicing thin. Combine all ingredients in
a bowl. Stir this mixture well with a spoon to dissolve all of the
soluble ingredients. Now the marinaade is ready to be used. Place the
strips of meat in the marinade, be sure they're completely submerged.
Marinate overnight, turning if necessary.  Lay marinated meat strips
on oven rack. Cook for 6 to 8 (6 is better) at 150 degrees. They get
crisper the longer they bake. Store finished jerky in zip-lock bags
or other airtight containers to seal in freshness.  Jerky will keep
up to two years. A good book on making beef jerky and other
light-weight foods is:

Sfeeha (Baked Lamb Pies)

meats, lamb, middle east, arab states

1  dough:
2 3/4 cup water; lukewarm (110 to 115
1  ; degrees)
2 pkg active dry yeast
1 pinch sugar
8 cup all purpose flour
2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup olive oil
1  filling:
2 cup onion; finely chopped
1 tablespoon salt
2 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup pine nuts; (pignolia)
2 lb lamb; lean, boneless and
1  ; coarsely ground
2 medium tomato; fresh, ripe, peeled,
1  ; seeded and finely chopped
1/2 cup green pepper; finely chopped
1/2 cup parsley; finely chopped
1  ; prefer flat leaf parsley
1/2 cup lemon juice, fresh
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon allspice
2 teaspoon salt
1  black pepper; freshly ground

Make the dough in the following fashion:  pour 1/4 cup of the
lukewarm water into a small, shallow bowl and sprinkle it with the
yeast and sugar.
Let the mixture rest for 2 or 3 minutes, then stir to dissolve the
yeast completely.  Set the bowl in a warm, draft free place (such as
a turned off oven) for about 5 minutes, or until the mixture almost
doubles in volume.
In a deep mixing bowl, combine the flour and the 2 teaspoons of
salt, make a well in the center and into it pour the yeast mixture,
the 1/4 cup of olive oil, and 2 cups of the remaining lukewarm water.
Gently stir the center ingredients together with a large spoon, then
slowly incorporate the flour and continue to beat until the
ingredients are well combined. Add up to 1/2 cup more lukewarm water,
beating it in a tablespoon or so at a time, and using as much as
necessary to form a dough that can be gathered into a compact ball.
If the dough is difficult to stir, work in the water with your
fingers.
Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead it by
pressing it down, pushing it forward several times with the heel of
your hand and folding it back on itself. Repeat for about 20 minutes,
or until the dough is smooth and elastic.  Sprinkle it from time to
time with a little flour to prevent it from sticking to the board.
Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl.
Drape loosely with a kitchen towel and set aside in the warm, draft
free place for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the dough doubles in
bulk. Punch the dough down with a single blow of your fist and divide
it into 16 equal pieces.  Roll each piece into a ball about 1 1/2
inches in diameter, cover the balls with a towel and let them rest
for 30 minutes.

FILLING:
Meanwhile, prepare the filling.  Drop the onions into a deep bowl
and sprinkle them with 1 tablespoon of the salt, turning them about
with a spoon to coat them evenly. Let the onions rest at room
temperature for at least 30 minutes, then squeeze them dry and return
them to the bowl.
In a small skillet or saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil
until a light haze forms above it.  Add the pine nuts and, stirring
constantly, brown them lightly. Add them to the bowl of onions, along
with the lamb, tomatoes, green pepper, parsley, lemon juice, vinegar,
tomato paste, cayenne pepper, allspice, 2 teaspoons of salt and a
liberal grinding of black pepper.  Knead the mixture vigorously with
both hands, then beat with a wooden spoon until the mixture is smooth
and fluffy. Taste for seasoning.
Preheat the oven to 500 degrees (F).  With a pastry brush, coat 3
large baking sheets or jelly roll pans with the remaining 3
tablespoons of oil.
On a lightly floured surface, roll each of the balls into a round
about 4 inches in diameter and no more than 1/8 inch thick. to make
open face pies, spoon about 1/2 cup of the lamb filling mixture on
the center of each round.  Then with a spatula or the back of the
spoon, spread the filling to about 1/2 inch of the edge.
To make closed pies, spoon about 1/2 cup of the filling on the
center of each round.  Pull up the edge from 3 equally distant points
to make a roughly triangular shaped pie and pinch the dough securely
together at the top.
With a metal spatula, arrange the pies on the baking sheets. Bake
in the lower third of the oven for 30 minutes, or until the pastry is
lightly browned. Serve hot, or at room temperature, accompanied, if
you like, with yogurt.

Shin Of Beef Stewed In Wine

meats, french

6 oz fat bacon or salt pork
1 each large onion
1 tablespoon olive oil
5 lb shin beef off the bone
2 each cloves garlic
1 each bouquet garni
8 oz red wine (or more)
1 teaspoon salt
8 oz beef stock or water

Cut the bacon or salt pork into small cubes and put them, with a
tablespoon of olive oil, into a heavy and fairly wide iron or
earthenware pot. When the bacon fat runs, add a large sliced onion
and stir about until slightly brown.  On top, arrange the shin of
beef, off the bone, skinned, excess fat removed, and cut lengthways
into thick pieces. Add the cloves of garlic, crushed but not chopped,
and the bouquet garni (either one of the "instant" ones, or a small
bunch of parsley, thyme and bayleaf, tied up with a string). Pour in
a large glass of red wine (about 8 oz) and let all come to a fast
boil for 4-5 minutes. Add about the same amount of beef stock or
water, and allow to boil again. Add salt. . Cover the pot with paper
or foil and a well-fitting lid. Transfer to a very slow oven, 290
degrees F or gas mark 1, and in about 3 hours it will be cooked.
Or you can half-cook it one day, remove it, and finish it the next.
Serve with potatoes or rice to soak up the sauce. (Egg noodles also
work well if you thicken the sauce slightly.) This dish can also be
simmered *very* slowly on top of the stove.

cast-iron pot, and saute the vegetables and beef for 5 minutes over
high heat. 3. Add the reserved tomato juice, water sugar, salt,
cayenne, and ginger. Cover, lower the heat, and simmer for 2 hours.
Stir occasionally to keep from burning. 4. Meanwhile, soak the
spinach in warm water for 15 minutes. Then rinse thoroughly,
separate, rinse again (and even a third time if you want to be extra
careful), shred coarsely, and set aside. 5. After 2 hours, add the
spinach to the pot and cook over medium heat for 30 minutes, until
the water is gone and the spinach is cooked. 6.  About half an hour
before serving, prepare boiled rice. Serve Shoko with rice. [Also
good served with Yam Foofoo.]

minute. Drain the beef immediately in a colander or sieve and drain
off the oil. Clean the wok and add about 1 tablespoon of the drained
oil. Reheat it until it is hot. Add the sesame seeds and stir-fry
them for 1 minute or until they are slightly brown. Add the sauce
ingredients and bring to a boil. Return the cooked beef to the pan
and stir-fry the mixture for another 2 minutes, coating the pieces
thoroughly with the sauce and sesame seeds. Serve at once, or let it
cool and serve at room temperature.

Singapore Fried Noodles

meats, chinese

6  skeins dried shrimp noodles
1/2 cup dried shrimp
1  egg
1 teaspoon water
1/2 lb barbecued pork
2  stalks celery
2 cup bean sprouts, blanched
1  medium yellow onion
1  green bell pepper
1  medium firm tomato
2  cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon fresh ginger, minced
1 tablespoon curry powder
4 tablespoon peanut oil
      ----SAUCE----
1/2 cup stock
2 teaspoon thin soy sauce
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon chili oil

Noodles:  Rinse shrimp noodles.  Boil noodles in water until cooked
but still firm.  These thin noodles only take about 3 minutes to
reach this stage.  Drain, reserving boiling water, & rinse with cold
water until noodles are cooled & will not stick together.  Place in
oiled bowl, refrigerate until firm.  The noodles must be firm before
frying. Can be prepared day before.

Preparation:  Wash & soak dried shrimp for 30 minutes; cut into thin
pieces. Combine egg & water; cook as very thin omelet; cool; slice
into 2" long shreds. Thinly slice pork to match. Blanch bean sprouts
in noodle water (this water will have other uses, so hold onto it).
Peel strings off celery stalks, thinly slice. Peel & halve onions,
slice thinly. Core pepper, slice thinly in 2" lengths. Slice tomato
in thin wedges. OR: slice these vegetables to match size of bean
sprouts for better looking dish (a good shredder does this job
quickly). Mix sauce ingredients in bowl.

Stir-fry:  Add 1/2 of peanut oil to hot wok.  When oil begins to
smoke, toss in garlic, ginger, shrimp & vegetables, except tomato;
stir-fry on high heat for 2 minutes. Add sauce, & continue cooking
until sauce reduces by half. Remove to holding bowl.

Rinse wok; return to high heat; when it is dry, reduce heat to medium
& add remaining peanut oil.  Heat oil to moderate (don`t let it
smoke); add curry powder, stirring to mix with oil. Avoid burning
curry; if it burns, start over.  Cook curry powder for about 30
seconds. Add noodles a fist-full at a time, breaking noodles into
short pieces. Toss noodles to coat & heat them. When hot, add cooked
shrimp & vegetables; toss together to mix. Turn off heat. Add pork,
egg shreds & tomato wedges; mix together. Serve. By the time dish is
on the table, tomatoes will be hot, but still firm.

Sizzling Beef Fajitas

meats, mexican

4 centiliter garlic, minced
1 tablespoon lime juice
1/3 cup worcestershire or soy sauce
4  serrano chiles, stemmed
1  and minced
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
14 can beef broth
2 tablespoon safflower oil
2  yellow or white onions,
1  thinly sliced
2  bell peppers, thinly sliced
4  limes, cut in half
1 cup sour cream
3 lb skirt steak, 1/2 inch thick
      ----MARINADE----
1  flour tortillas
1  pico de gallo
1  guacamole

Originally from: "Austin American=Stateman, May 24,
1990    Sizzling Beef Fajitas

At least 3 hours before grilling the meat, trim it to remove all fat
and gristle. For skirt steak, use a flat metal pounder to tenderize.
{This is needed because of the short marinading time.} Put the meat
in a shallow glass dish or plastic bag. Combine the marinade
ingredients. Marinate for about 3 hours in refrigerator.

About 45 minutes before serving, clean the grill surface and rub it
with an oil dampened cloth. Preheat the grill for about 30 minutes.
Remove the meat from the marinade. Sprinkle the meat and salt and
pepper and place it on the grill. Baste with marinade, grill, then
turn, baste again and grill until medium rare, about 5-6 minutes in
all, or until desired doneness. Remove, cover with foil and keep warm.

Heat 2 TBSP oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the
onions and cook until browned, but still crisp. Remove and add bell
peppers. Saute about 2 minutes and add onions. Remove the skillet
from the heat.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Wrap the tortillas or pita breads
in foil and heat until warm, 8-10 minutes. {Or zap 'em in a microwave
for 15 to 25 seconds per tortilla, depending on your microwaves
strength. Or grill 'em on the coals for a few seconds, or in another
cast iron skillet for a few seconds.}

Cut the beef across the grain into strips about 1/4 inch thick.
Reserve all the juices. Put the skillet back on high heat long enough
to get hot, then add the meat. It will sizzle. Turn immediately, then
put the onions and peppers on top. Pour the reserved juices on top to
create a sizzle. (For an even more dramatic sizzle, you can drizzle
the meat and onions with 2 TBSP oil instead of the reserved juices.)
Carry the skillet immediately to the table. Squeeze lime juice on
top. To serve, use tortillas to enclose meat strips, peppers, onions,
pico de gallo, guacamole, and sour cream.

Small Bird & Bacon Stew With Walnuts Or Haz

meats

6  fatty rashers of bacon, chopped rou; ghly
3  cloves garlic
4  pigeons or other small game birds (; 6 if very small)
8 oz mushrooms, chopped roughly
3 oz hazelnuts or walnuts, roasted, coar; sely chopped
1 1/4 cup real ale
3/4 cup water
3  bay leaves salt black pepper, fresh; ground
6  coarse slices brown bread

Fry the bacon, with the garlic, till it is lightly browned in a heavy
bottomed casserole. Add birds and brown on all sides. Add the
mushrooms and nuts, continue to cook for a couple of minutes, then
add the ale and water with the bay leaves. Bring to the boil, cover
and simmer very gently for 2 ~ 2 1/2 hours-- the birds should be
falling off the bone. Remove the birds from the juices, cool juices
completely and remove any excess fat. The birds can be served whole
on or off the bone. If the latter, carve them while they are cold
then return to the skimmed juices and reheat gently. Adjust the
seasoning to taste and serve either the whole birds of the slices on
the pieces of bread, with plenty of the juices and "bits". A good
green salad to follow is the best accompaniment.

Smoked Beef

meats

1  2-4 lb lean beef roast
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon black pepper
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon cumin

* Use a covered Grill (Webber is the best.) or make a cover for your
grill
with aluminum foil and Clothes hangers. * Build two fires on each
side of where the meat will be. * Place a drip pan (alumimum foil
again) with water under where the meat
will be. * Soak your smoking wood (preferably hickory) at least
overnight.

Mix the spices together to make a dry rub.   Rub the spice mixture on
the trimmed beef roast and let marinate overnight in your icebox.
When the fire has developed to ash covered, add the smoking wood and
the meat, cover, and don't peek for at least 2 hours. Then add
charcoal and smoke for another 2 hours. As always, adjust as
necessary but the slower you smoke, the longer it will take and the
more tender the meat will be. Submitted By KEN HAYCOOK

1 hour. WHOLE SALMON: Brush salmon cavity with dill and seasoned
salt. Repeat on the outside of the salmon.  Chill leftover salmon and
serve with sour cream and dill or Yogurt Dill Sauce. Charcoal Smoker:
Use 7 to 9 lbs. charcoal, 4 quarts hot water, 2 wood chunks and smoke
3 to 5 hours, depending on size. Electric Smoker: Use 4 quarts hot
water, 2 wood chunks and smoke 3 to 5 hours, depending on size.
Yield: 1/3 lb. per person Note: This very expensive delicacy can be
made easily and economically at home. Serve hot or cold with Cucumber
Mayonnaise or Yogurt Dill Sauce. Another note: Frozen seafood should
always be thawed before cooking. The most harm you can do to seafood
is to overcook.  Seafood is done when the flesh turns white or
opazue. The meat will flake easily when forked and shellfish will
feel firm to the touch. If cooked in the shell, the shells will open
when done. Seafood is most delicate and requires short cooking times.
Fish with high fat content will require longer cooking. Recipe from
"Cook'n Cajun Water Smoker Cookbook".

Smothered Burritos

cheese/eggs, main dish, meats, mexican

      ----SMOTHERED BURRITOS----
1  flour tortillas (see below)
1  refied beans
1  chili verde (see below)
1  mozzarella cheese and/or
1  cheddar cheese and/or
1  monterey jack cheese  all grated
      ----FLOUR TORTILLAS----
4 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon shortening
1  warm water, 1 to 1 1/2 cups
      ----CHILE VERDE----
3 cup diced, roasted and peeled  anaheim; peppers (see  below)
1  or
28 oz ortega whole green chilis,  chopped
2 cup water
2 lb diced lean pork or  diced lean or g; round beef
1 tablespoon shortening
1 tablespoon flour
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

SMOTHERED BURRITOS: Heat flour tortilla on grill about 10 seconds;
turn and heat another 10 seconds until hot. Add about 3/4 cup refied
beans; roll. Place on serving plate. Top with Chili Verde and
generous amounts of cheeses, using as desired. Buzz in microwave
about 3 minutes, until cheese is melted. FLOUR TORTILLAS: Mix flour,
baking soda, salt and shortening with hands until thoroughly
combined. Add enough warm water to make a manageable dough (easy to
roll). Pinch off pieces of dough about the size of a biscuit. Roll
into a circle about 1/8-inch thick. Put on heated 300-degree grill
for about 6 seconds; turn and cook another 8 seconds. Repeat with
remaining dough. Makes 24 flour tortillas. Tortillas may be frozen.
Stack between sheets of waxed paper. "When my children were growing
up, I always made the Flour Tortillas in the evening for the next
day. Sometimes I made dessert flour tortillas by decreasing the salt
to 1/2 teaspoon and adding 1/2 teaspoon sugar to the dough. I would
heat them on the grill, then immediately top with cinnamon and sugar
or honey." CHILI VERDE: Roast Anaheim peppers in 350-degree oven
about 15 minutes; turn and roast an additional 15 minutes.  Remove
from oven; cool. (The peppers may be frozen at this point.) To peel
roasted Anaheims, steam a few minutes; cool as needed, then peel and
dice. Add 2 cups water; set aside. In a large skillet, cook pork (or
beef) in melted shortening until browned and completely cooked. Add
flour, garlic salt and pepper, blending well. Add Anaheim pepper
mixture; bring to a boil.  Reduce temperature and simmer 10 minutes.

Snails With Frog Legs

meats

48  burgundy snails
1  court bouillon
4  shallots
1  chives
3/4 cup white macon wine
24  frogs' legs
1/2 cup milk
1  flour
4 tablespoon butter
1  salt and pepper
1  chopped parsley, to garnish

[Looking at the ingredients, I figure that this'll feed 4 as a main
course or 8 as an appetizer.  -- mkm] Preparation 1 1/2 hours.
Cooking 1 1/4 hours. Cook the snails in advance in a court bouillon,
then remove them from their shells. [There's a description of court
bouillon in "Joy of Cooking."  Basically, a court bouillon is an
aromatic liquid or stock, sometimes containing wine, vinegar or lemon
juice, used mainly for cooking fish and shellfish, but also sometimes
white offal (variety meats) and some white meats. -- mkm] Chop them,
together with the peeled shallots and a small bunch of well-washed
chives. Place these ingredients in a saucepan with the wine, cover
and simmer for 1 hour. Meanwhile, soak the frogs' legs in the milk
for 1 hour.  Drain them, then roll in flour and saute in the butter
in a frying pan over a brisk heat for 10 minutes. Add the snails,
together with their cooking juices, and season with salt and pepper.
[Personally, I prefer to mill the pepper at the dinner table. The
smell of the freshly ground pepper would otherwise be lost. -- mkm]
Turn up the heat and cook for a further 5 minutes. Sprinkle with
chopped parsley and serve. White wines: Macon-Clesse, -Lugny, -Vire
or -Ige, Hermitage, Crepy. [From "Larousse Traditional French
Cooking."]

Snippets Of Venison

meats

3/4 lb best venison trimmings
2 fl oz cider
4 fl oz good stock
6 oz cap mushrooms
1 bunch chives
1  garlic
1  juniper
1  unsalted butter
4 fl oz soured cream or greek yogurt

Cut the meat into strips about the size of your thumb - if possible. Some
of the trimmings may, of course, be slightly ragged, triangular or cubed
but this is the size and shape to aim for.  Dust with coarsely ground black
pepper and 3 to 4 crushed juniper berries, moisten with the cider, cover
and leave to marinate for 24 hours. Crush a garlic clove, mix it with the
soured cream or yoghurt and leave it to infuse in a cool place for 24
hours.

Carefully drain and dry the venison, reserving the marinade.  Slice the
mushrooms thickly and saute them in a little very hot butter. Remove and
keep hot.  Then saute the venison briefly, searing it nicely but keeping it
succulent and pink within - 2 minutes is plenty. Then let the venison rest
in a low oven where it will go on cooking a little without toughening.
Start making the sauce straight away or wait for several minutes if you
want the meat to lose its pinkness.

To make the sauce, let the marinade liquid and the stock bubble away in the
frying pan until reduced to just 2 or 3 spoonfuls.  Blend in any juices
that the venison has exuded and bubble again briefly. Then beat in the
garlic-flavoured soured cream, away from the heat. Return the pan to a low
flame to warm the sauce.  Season well, scatter with chopped chives and
serve on very hot plates.

Souvlaki With Tzaziki

meats

      ----SOUVLAKI----
2 lb lamb shoulder; -or- sirloin tip;cut in 1
2 cup red wine; dry
2  garlic cloves; minced
1 teaspoon oregano; dried
2 teaspoon lemon rind; long strips up to 3 tsp
1/4 cup olive oil sweet peppers and cherry; tomatoes as needed
      ----TZAZIKI----
2 cup yogurt; pain
1/2  cucumber; english,peeled & grated
2  garlic cloves; minced
3 tablespoon olive oil salt

"Begin preparing the tzazik a few hours before serving. The flavours
need time to blend. Marinate the meat overnight to absorb the wine
and garlic." SOUVLAKI: Place the meat in a large bowl. Pour in the
wine and sprinkle minced garlic and oregano. Imbed the lemon strips
among the cubes of meat and drizzle with olive oil. Cover tightly
with plastic wrap and refrigerate 12 hours or overnight. Shake or
stir the mixture several times during the marination period.
About 30 minutes before serving, drain off and discard the marinade.
Thread the chunks of meat onto long skewers, brushing with a little
olive oil. (We usually BBQ the peppers and tomatoes on separate
skewers but it's really up to the chef.)
Over medium coals, barbeque the souvlaki until it's done the way
you like it. Serve on a bed of rice and pass the tzaziki to spoon on
top. SERVES 4-6 TZAZIKI: Line a colander or sieve with cheesecloth
(or gauze) and set it over a bowl. Pour in the yogurt and allow it to
drip for an hour or so. After the yogurt has drained, combine it, in
a small bowl, with the cucumber and the garlic. Cover the bowl
tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until just before serving.
While the meat is BBQing, drizzle the olive oil over the surface, and
without stirring, sprinkle on the salt. It needs no mixing - your
guest will do that when they dollop it onto their souvlaki. MAKES:

Spanish Hot Dogs & Rice

meats, spanish, rice

1 can stewed tomatoes.
1/2 lb hot dogs sliced 1/2
1  thick
3/4 cup green pepper, diced
3/4 cup onion, diced
1  rice for 4 people

Contributed to the echo by: Marge Clark The recipe has no real
measurments...is a "what you have"... Spanish hot dogs & rice: Enough
rice for four people... put rice on to cook...while it's cooking
slice as many hot dogs as you have (lets say 1/2 pound or more) into
pennies, about 1/2 inch thick. dice 1 green pepper...I used to use
the frozen diced pepper and use a couple of handsful..maybe 3/4 cup?
Diced onion. ditto on the amount. combine all the above, heat, while
the rice is cooking...set the table and spray on some perfume.

This is obviously not a gourmet feast for company. But everyone ATE
it! and there is little that's faster or easier!

Spicy Fresh Country Sausage

main dish, makemeat

1 x no ingredients

3 lb.     pork butt 3/4-1 lb. pork back fat 4 tsp. kosher salt (or use
canning salt) 2 tsp. coarsely ground black pepper 2 tsp. dried sage (ugh,
you don't have to use this!) 1 tsp. dried thyme 2 tsp. sugar 1 Tbls. red
pepper flakes 1 tsp. cayenne 1/2 Cup water Medium hog casings (optional)

Put the meat and fat through the meat grinder, using the 1/4-inch plate,
(or use food processor). In a large bowl, mix the ground pork, fat, spices,
herbs, and water, kneading and squeezing the meat until everything is
nicely blended. If you are making the sausage for patties, simply wrap it
in bulk and refrigerate (or freeze) it. Or stuff the seasoned meat into
medium hog casings and tie into 4-inch links. Fresh sausage will keep for 3
days in the refrigerator, frozen for up to 2 months.

This recipe gives the basics of sausage making and can be varied. You can
mix in one or more herbs like marjoram, summer savory, or dried rosemary
along with a spice like nutmeg, cloves, allspice, or ginger. A good rule of
thumb is to add 1/2 tsp. of a dried herb and/or a pinch of spice to the
basic recipe. Two tsp. of minced garlic can also be added. Fry up a small
patty to test and taste, and mix in more flavor as you go.

Southern farm wives used to stuff bulk sausage into small muslin bags or
'pokes', or fry patties and layer them in their own fat for preservation
over the winter. The modern alternative is freezing.

Squid Sausage

makemeat

8 medium squid, about 6-7 long
1 centiliter garlic, finely minced
1 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon coarse grind black pepper
1 cup fresh bread crumbs
1 tablespoon plus -see next ingredient-
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 cup dry vermouth
2 cup crushed tomatoes

To clean the squid: cut off the tentacles and reserve. Cut off and discard
the mouth which is in the center of the tentacles. Under cold running
water, peel off the outer skin and discard. Squeeze the body to push out
the insides, pulling off the head when the insides are out. Pull out the
center bone (it looks like a piece of clear plastic) and discard. Turn the
body inside out and rinse well. Turn back and rinse. Dry on paper towels.
Chop the tentacles coarsely in the food processor. Add the garlic, parsley,
oregano, salt, and peppre. Process until blended. Add the bread crumbs and
one tb of the oil. Mix well. Fill the bodies of the squid. Fill between
half and three quarters full. If you over fill them they will burst when
cooking. Either skewer them closed or shut with toothpicks or roughly
stitch with cotton thread and a needle. Heat remaining olive oil in a
skillet and add the squid. Turn often to prevent sticking. Cook until
lightly browned. Add the vermouth and saute until the wine has nearly
evaporated. Add the crushed tomatoes and simmer 20 minutes, uncovered.
Serve warm.

Steve's Meat Loaf

meats

      ----LOAF----
2 lb hamburger
1  egg
1 dash nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 cup mushroom soup concentrate, canned
1/2 cup onion, chopped
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1/3 cup marinara sauce
1  (or spaghetti sauce
1  or pizza sauce)
2  garlic cloves,  minced
2 teaspoon seasoned salt (or use
1  a mixture of salt,
1  pepper, cayenne and
1  celery seed)
      ----SAUCE----
8 oz canned mushroom soup
1  concentrate (use the
1  rest of the can)
3 oz mushrooms, sliced
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup drippings (from
1  baking the loaf)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Mix all ingredients together well, shape
into loaf and put into a pan. If you use a roasting rack instead of a bread
pan, the loaf will be less greasy and you can use some of the drippings to
make the sauce. Bake 20 minutes uncovered at 425 degrees F. Turn down the
oven to 375 degrees F. and continue baking, uncovered, for 55 more minutes.

MAKE THE SAUCE:  Fry the mushrooms in the drippings and then combine the
drippings and mushrooms with the mushroom soup and sour cream. Heat this
mixture in a sauce pan.  When meatloaf is done, put on a plate, cover with
sauce, slice and eat.

NOTES:

*  A quick and flavorful meat loaf -- This is my own adaptation of a recipe
I got many years ago from a Campbell's soup cookbook. It usually gets rave
reviews from guests.  Yield:  serves 4-6.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 1/2 hours cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

1  bay leaf -- crushed
12 small white boiling onions
3 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup water
1/2 lb mushrooms
3 tablespoon whole-wheat pastry flour or
1  unbleached white flour
4 cup cooked basmati rice or egg
1  noodles

1. Cut meat into 1-inch cubes. In a large Dutch oven over medium-high
heat, sear beef in 1 teaspoon of the safflower oil until lightly
browned on all sides. Pour in brandy and ignite, shaking pan until
flames subside. Add wine, stock, tomato paste, garlic, thyme, and bay
leaf. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to simmer. Cook, uncovered,
until tender (about 20 to 30 minutes). Preheat oven to 200 degrees F.

2. Peel onions and cut a small X in the top of each to prevent them
from falling apart as they cook. In a small skillet over medium-high
heat, saute onions in 1 teaspoon of the olive oil. Add the water,
cover, and cook for
15    minutes.

3. Drain onions and set aside. In the same pan over medium-high heat,
saute mushrooms in the remaining 1 teaspoon safflower oil for 5
minutes. Set aside.

4. Remove beef from sauce and keep warm on a platter in the oven.
Bring sauce to a boil and reduce to half its volume by simmering,
uncovered, for 10 minutes. Combine together remaining olive oil and
flour and drop into boiling sauce by spoonfuls, stirring with a whisk
until sauce thickens.

5. Return beef to sauce, and add onions and mushrooms. Heat through
and serve over rice.

Stir Fried Two Noodles (Hokkien Mee)

fish, meats, pasta

1  stephen ceideburg
1 cup water
1 cup basic chicken stock
1 tablespoon light or dark soy sauce
1/2 lb pork shoulder, in one piece
1/4 lb squid, cleaned and cut up
1/4 lb raw shrimp in the shell
2 tablespoon oil or lard
3  unpeeled cloves garlic, crushed
6 oz thin egg noodles, boiled, drained,; and tossed in a
1 tablespoon oil
4 oz thick rice sticks (see note), soake; d and drained
2 cup bean sprouts
1/4 cup chinese chives or garlic chives, cu; t into 1-inch lengths

This is a favorite street snack among the Chinese in many Southeast
Asian cities. Hokkien is the local pronunciation of Fujian (Fukien)
province in southeast China, the origin of many Chinese emigrants
over the years. In a typical noodle-vendor's stand, the pork and
shellfish are cooked in a stock that simmers for hours, picking up
more flavor all the time. In this home version, the extra flavor
comes from reducing the stock after cooking the meats.

1. In a small saucepan combine water, stock, soy sauce, and pork.
Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until meat is tender. Remove
meat and set aside. Return stock to a boil. Add squid and cook 30
seconds. Remove and set aside. Cook shrimp 2 to 3 minutes. Drain and
set aside, reserving stock. Peel shrimp and devein if necessary. (For
additional flavor, add shrimp shells to stock and simmer 10 minutes
longer.)

2. Bring stock to a boil and reduce by half. Strain stock. (The
recipe may be prepared to this point several hours ahead.)

3. Slice pork into bite-sized pieces. In a wok or large skillet, heat
oil or lard and garlic to near smoking. Remove and discard garlic
cloves when they brown. Add noodles and rice sticks and stir-fry
until they are lightly browned in places. Add stock, cover, and cook
2 minutes. Remove cover, add pork, squid, shrimp, and bean sprouts,
and continue stirring and cooking until noodles have absorbed' most
of the liquid, about two minutes. @1'transfer to serving platter and
garnish with Chinese chives.

Serves 4 with other dishes.

Note: The authentic rice noodle for this dish is a thicker rice stick
called laifen in China and pancit luglug in the Phil- ippines, but
ordinary thin rice sticks may be used.

onion. Add green pepper and fry a little more. Add remaining
ingredients, cover and cook over low heat for 15 or 20 minutes
stirring occasionally to avoid sticking.  The red pepper may be added
now or used to decorate. Serve with rice or salad.

Stuffed Venison Pinwhells

meats, wild game

2  whole venison backstraps,
1  rolled out 1/4 in. thick
1 quart whole milk
2 teaspoon wild game seasoning
1 lb velveeta cheese
1 can rotel tomatoes with diced
1  chiles
2 lb thinly sliced lean bacon
1/2 cup thinly sliced green onions
8  cloves garlic, finely mince

First, prepare the backstrap fillet. It's an extremely tender tubelike
piece of meat about 12 inches long and 2 to 3 inches in diameter. And
because of its shape, it can be cut around the perimeter, 1/4 inch
thick, and rolled out flat. To do this, you need a very sharp knife.
Start by laying out the fillet perpendicular to your body and making
a shallow slice about 1/4 inch deep in the meat. Then, as if slicing
through and unrolling paper towels from a roll, begin working around
the outside perimeter of the fillet until the backstrap comes out
looking like a round steak. It takes a little practice to do ... but
you can do it! When the meat is ready, place both pieces into a glass
or plastic container and cover them with whole milk. You want to
marinate the venison for at least 6 hours, but preferably overnight.
The milk tenderizes the deer and helps to remove any unwanted gamey
flavor. After the marination process, remove the meat from the milk
(you can discard the milk), and pat the venison dry with several
paper towels. Then liberally sprinkle both sides with wild game
seasoning and rub it briskly into the meat. At this point, preheat
your oven to 400 degrees. Then, in your food processor, mix together
the Velveeta cheese and the Rotel tomatoes until smooth and creamy.
When you're ready to make the pinwheels, spread a thin layer of the
cheese mixture evenly over one side of the deer. Then place a layer
of bacon strips - side by side - on top of the cheese. Finish up the
preparation by lightly sprinkling on a little sliced green onions and
a little minced garlic. Now tightly roll up the flattened fillets and
set them aside momentarily. Then on the same work surface, lay out
another 8 to 10 strips of bacon side by side and put one of the
rolled backstraps on top of them. Now wrap the bacon strips around
the venison and pin them in place with toothpicks. When you are
finished, the backstrap should be completely encased in bacon strips.
Repeat with the other backstrap. All that's left is to take a sharp
knife, slice the rolled venison into 2 inch thick pinwheels, position
them on a shallow cookie sheet, and bake them - uncovered - in the
oven for about 40 to 45 minutes. You'll notice that a light sauce
will form in the bottom of the cookie sheet; you can use this to
baste the pinwheels as they cook. The one thing you don't want to do
is overcook the venison - it will come out dry and chewy instead of
juicy and tender if you do! Chef's Note: If you don't have wild game
seasoning on hand, you can lightly sprinkle the venison with salt,
black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and sweet basil as a
substitute. Unfortunately, most spice manufacturers don't make a
premixed wild game seasoning, but my company does. If you'd like me
to send you some, simply call 1-800-742-4231

Stu's Old English Prime Rib

main dish, meats

1/2 lb prime rib (per person)
1 teaspoon msg powder
1 teaspoon paprika
2 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
1  salt to taste
1  pepper to taste
1  rock salt (ice cream salt)

Rub seasoning into meat. In a large roaster(not aluminum) pour a
layer of rock salt until bottom of pan is completely covered. Lightly
dampen the rock salt with water until salt is just moist. Place the
meat onto the salt in a standing rib position. Then cover prime rib
completely with rock salt and dampen with water. DO NOT cover the
roaster. Place in preheated oven at 500 degrees. Roast 15 to 18 per
pound (rare 15 minutes). When cooking time is completed, remove
roast. Break rock salt away from meat with a hammer (hard seal formed)

NOTE: DO NOT use any powder rock salt. I filter the rock salt with
colander. Use only that rock salt that does not sift through the
colander.

Prime rib cooked this way becomes fork tender.

Enjoy

Super Duper Pot Roast

beef, roast

4 lb beef chuck (about 1 1/2
1  thick)
1 tablespoon shortening
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce
2 teaspoon worchestershire sauce
2 tablespoon vinegar
1 large onion, sliced
1/4 cup butter or margarine

Turn oven on.  Brown the roast in the shortening in the Dutch oven,
uncovered, on medium heat on range surface unit.  When browned on one
side, turn and sprinke the browned side with half the salt, black pepper,
hot pepper sauce and worchestershire sauce.  When second side is browned,
turn and sprinkle with rest of seasonings.

Dribble the vinegar evenly over the roast, cover with the onion slices and
on these place the half stick of butter, cut into chunks.  Cover closely
and cook in oven till tender, about 3 hrs. If adding vegetables (peeled
and halved medium size potatoes, split carrots and halved medium sized
onions) add them after the roast has cooked about 1 1/2 hrs.  Spoon some
of the liquid from the roast ove them and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Continue cooking until roast and vegetables are tender. Note: I sometimes
cook this roast in a 350^ oven for 30 min. then turn the oven down to
250^.  This gets it off to a quicker start, and shortens cooking time to
about 2 1/2 hrs.

Sweet & Sour Lamb Chops

appetizers, main dish, meats, microwave

2 tablespoon butter or margarine
2 lb shoulder lamb chops
1  salt and pepper
8 oz pineapple chunks in unsweet-
1  ened juice, undrained
1/4 cup firm packed dark brown sugar
1/4 cup white vinegar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon brown bouquet sauce
2  carrots, peeled and thinly sliced
1 large green pepper, cut into 1-inch squar; es

I. Melt butter in a heat-resistant, non-metallic broiler-proof
skillet on a conventional surface unit. When butter is hot, sear lamb
chops on both sides until lightly browned. Sprinkle with salt and
pepper to taste. Or use the "browner" for 4 to 5 minutes per side. 2.
While the chops are browning, drain pineapple juice into a small
heat-resistant, non-metallic bowl. Reserve pineapple chunks; add
brown sugar, vinegar, cornstarch and brown bouquet sauce to pineapple
juice. Stir to combine. 3. Heat pineapple juice mixture, uncovered, 2
minutes in Micro- wave Oven or until thickened and clear. 4. Pour
thickened sauce over browned lamb chops. 5. Add carrot slices and
heat, covered, 5 minutes in Microwave Oven. Add pineapple chunks and
heat, covered, 2 1/2 minutes in Microwave Oven. Add green pepper
squares and heat, un- covered, in Microwave Oven 2 1/2 minutes, or
until lamb and vegetables are tender. Variations: Pork chops, veal
chops, boneless chicken pieces or shrimp may be substituted for the
lamb chops; however, cooking times will have to be adjusted for pork,
chicken, and shrimp. Pork chops will require an extra 2 minutes in
Step 5, as pork should always be cooked to well-done. Chicken should
be cooked for only 4 minutes in Step 5 and shrimp 3 minutes.

Szerb Bableves (Serbian Bean Soup)

beef, beans, hungary, peas

1/2 lb beans, white, dry
3 lb beef bones
2 each carrots; peeled, sliced
1 each parsnips; peeled
1 tablespoon salt
1 each little dumplings (recipe)
1 tablespoon lard
1 small onions
2 tablespoon flour, all-purpose
3 each garlic cloves; chopped, mashed
1 tablespoon paprika, hot
1 cup yogurt, plain
1 teaspoon vinegar, white

Soak beans in 1 quart cold water the night before you plan to make
soup. Next day, drain beans and put aside.
Put 2 quarts water in a large soup pot and in it cook bones and
vegetables with salt over low heat for 2 hours. Strain and save
liquid.
Put drained beans into the reserved liquid; add enough water to
bring the amount back to 2 quarts. Cook covered over low heat till
beans are done.
Make little dumplings and put aside.
Melt the lard in a frying pan. Wilt onion in it, then mix in the
flour and cook over very low heat till the mixture is light brown.
Remove from heat and mix in mashed garlic and paprika. Whip in 1/2
cup cold water. Add to the almost ready bean soup and cook the soup
over very low heat for at least 10 minutes longer.
Note: this southern Hungarian dish probably appears in Serbian
cookbooks as a Serbian dish, where it is hopefully titled "Hungarian
Bean Soup".

3/4 cup soy sauce
3/4 cup sake
1/2 cup mirin
2 cup dashi

Mix  together  soy sauce, sake, mirin and dashi. (Sake and Mirin
wines can be bought in most liquor stores. Dashi, a base for Japanese
soup stock,is available in most Oriental stores.) Bring to boil.Add
steak and return to boil.Cook 3 to 5 minutes.Be careful not to
overcook the meat;it should be rare on the inside. Remove steak,wrap
in foil and refrigerate overnight. Continue boiling,cooking until
liquid has reduced to a thick sauce. You can tell when it is
done,because the sauce makes large, slow bubbles when it is ready.Be
careful; otherwise the sauce will burn. Refrigerate overnight. To
serve: Cut all fat from steaks. Slice in very thin slices. Arrange on
a plate. Just before serving; pour 1 tsp. of reduced cooking sauce
over meat. You can also garnish with a little chopped green onion.
For an appetizer serving, allow 5 to 7 slices per person. Serves 6.

Tender Cooker Chuck Roast

beef

1 tablespoon oil
3 lb chuck roast
1/2 cup water
1  garlic clove, chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1  onion, cut up
3  potatoes, cut up
1 tablespoon flour

Heat oil in medium sized skillet, sear meat on all sides; place meat
in Tender Cooker.  Add water, garlic, salt and pepper to skillet.
Heat and scrape off any browned meat; pour mixture over meat. Arrange
onion and potato on top of meat.  Place a single 7" circle of foil on
top of food. Cover and add regulator guage, microwave on high 30
minutes. Let pressure indicator drop, remove cover. Remove meat and
vegies, add flour mixed with a little water, stir, microwave,
uncovered, stir once, to thicken juices. (a 400-500 w oven needs an
increase of time of 6 min.)

That is their recipe - I don't do any of the above. My roast is
usually one with a lot less fat in in (as little as I can manage when
I cut a big piece of meat into roast, steak and stew meat) and is
almost always still frozen and so I don't brown it first.  I put the
meat and water in the cooker, cover and cook on high 20 minutes. When
the indicator drops, I add potatoes, onion, carrots, and such
seasoning as I want at the time, rinse the rubber ring, replace ring,
recover (with pressure cap) and micro on high for 10 minutes. Let
pressure drop, thicken juices and enjoy!

Texas-Style Brisket

beef, outdoor

1  beef brisket (3-5 lbs)
1 pkg lipton onion soup mix
1 can (10.5 oz.) beef broth
1  onion, finely chopped
1  crushed red pepper to taste

Start charcoal for indirect method cooking (see note). Trim the fat
off the brisket. Rub contents of onion soup onto both sides of beef
and wrap tightly with three sheets of tin foil turning the wrap 90
degrees after each wrapping. This will help keep the juices from
seeping out. When coals are white hot throw the brisket on. Cover and
cook for about 2 hours; turning it over after one hour. Add more
charcoal as necessary. Remove from grill and carefully open package
without spilling juices. Return meat to grill for about 10-15 minutes
(cover with lid).  Meanwhile, mix drippings with the can of broth and
onion. Bring to a boil to reduce the liquid. When cooking time is up
for brisket remove juice from heat and pour into a serving bowl. Add
crushed red pepper to taste.

Note:  Do not place hot coals directly under meat; rather, place some
in front and some behind.  Use about 16 coals or less at one time.
Remember to cook slow.

The Hotel Limpia's Chicken Fried Beef Tenderloin

meats, poultry, newspaper

1 lb beef tenderloin
2 cup flour
1  black pepper to taste
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1/2 teaspoon lemon pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 cup whole milk
1/2 cup buttermilk
1  oil for frying

Cut tenderloin into 4 equal pieces and pound to tenderize (or have butcher
do this for you). Mix flour and seasonings in a pie plate.

Mix whole milk and buttermilk in a second pie plate.

Coat tenderloin on all sides in flour mixture. Dip in milk mixture. Dip
again in flour to coat all sides.

Set aside on wax paper for 10 minutes to allow coating to set.

In large fry pan, heat enough oil to cover bottom of pan and up the sides
1/4 to 1/2 inch. Heat oil over medium heat until the oil shimmers.

Carefully, slide coated pieces of meat into hot oil and fry until
tenderloin is browned on each side, cook to desired doneness. Medium-rare
to medium iS recommended. Do not allow meat to touch side of pan; batter
may stick and break away.

Makes 4 servings.

The Mavin's Way To Pickle Beef Or Tongue

meats, preserves, corned

3 lb beef brisket or beef tongue
1 quart cold water
2 teaspoon pickling spices; minus the red pepper. or
5  garlic cloves; chopped
4  bay leaves
3 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon saltpeter; seenote or
1 teaspoon ascorbic acid

Seenote; saltpeter, controversy about the use of this item makes me
add a substitute.
From a well known source I quote; " Use Pure crystalline ascorbic
acid (Vitamin C) instead of saltpeter because pure ascorbic acid
can't do you an iota of harm. Use at the rate of 0.05 percent of the
weight of meat, which works out to 1 gram of crystalline ascorbic
acid for every 4.5 pounds; or rounding it off, to 1/4 teaspoon for 5
pounds, 1/2 teaspoon for 10 pounds, and so on. Add the ascorbic acid
to either the dry cure or the Brine." This from "Putting Food By" a
resource for storing and preservation by the team of Hertzberg,
Vaughn, and Greene.
Buy the brisket well marbled with fat. This is cheaper cut, usually,
but turns out to be more suitable for this recipe. Use the exact
recommended weight of meat because the other ingredients are
calibrated for this. Be especially careful when measuring saltpeter;
use exactly the amount listed. Place the meat in a deep glass bowl or
a stoneware crock. Pour the quart of water into another glass bowl.
Add the remaining ingredients, mix together, and pour over the meat;
add enough water to cover. Tightly cover and refrigerate. It is best
to keep this in the coldest part of the refrigerator. Mark your
calendar: For best results, marinate for 19 days. Every 2 days turn
the meat, using wooden spoons. Add water if necessary, but ONLY A
LITTLE BIT, or the meat might spoil. At the end of the pickling
period, discard the pickling water, and wash the meat with cold
water. It is ready to cook

Tournados Of Beef Rossini

main dish, meats

1  3-4 ounce filet mignon
1/3 cup bearnaise sauce
1  english muffin
1 medium tomato
2  toothpicks :)
1/2 cup grated parmesean cheese

Split a good 3 1/2 or 4 ounce Filet Mignon in 2 medallions (disks) and
broil or charbroil to desired degree. Place each half on crisply
toasted english muffin. (I have used fried rounds of a good dense
french bread) Cover it all with a generous portion of Bearnaise sauce
and top with "crown" of tomato.

To make the crown, hold the tomato on it's side and jab the point of a
paring knife straight thru the tomato at a 45 degree angle to a line
running from top to bottom. repeat all around till you get back to
where you started. the tomato will fall apart. If not gently twist it
to separate the halves.

Your cut will look like this: /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\

DIp the cut side into any decent grated parmasean cheese and slip
under the broiler for a few seconds to brown the cheese. Place the
tomato on top of the filet and secure it with a toothpick.

It's ready to serve.

HOLLANDAISE SAUCE =================

Separate 6 large eggs in a heat resistant bowl or double boiler. Melt
6 oz butter in a separate pan. Beat the yolks with a wire wisk, OVER
not in, boiling water until they begin to thicken. Very gradually add
the clarified butter in a thin stream while constantly beating the
mixture.

A good rule of thumb: 1 LARGE egg yolk will hold 1 to
1 1/2 oz of butter.

Be very careful to add the butter slowly and that the butter is not
hotter than the yolks or the sauce will "break" (begin to separate).
As soon as all the butter is incorporated, remove the bowl from the
heat source and keep beating to cool the sauce. Whip in the lemon
juice, cayenne, and white wine.

Variations on Hollandaise Sauce: Replace lemon juice with orange juice
concentrate for Maltese Sauce.

Replace juices and add tarragon, shallots, and basil for Bearnaise
sauce. (saute the tarragon, basil, and minced shallots in some of the
butter) See

Tripe***

main dish, meats, italian

3 lb honyeycomb tripe
4 tablespoon butter
4 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion sliced
1/3 cup fresh chopped parsley
8 oz can tomato sauce
1 cup water
1  salt and pepper to taste

Parboil the tripe for about 1 hour. When cool enough to handle, cut
into strips about 1"by 3". Saute onion in butter and olive oil. When
they are golden add the rest of the ingredients andmix well. Simmer
for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until tender. If needed, add a bit more water
at the end to make just a bit of sauce to soak up with some good
crusty bread. Serve hot with grated cheese on the side. Don`t forget
the bread.
Variation: with a few minor adjustments, you can use this as a pasta
sauce. Cut the tripe a bit smaller and add about 4 more oz of tomato
sauce and 1/2 cup of dry wine, white or red. This will give you more
sauce for the spaghetti. Don`t forget to adjust the salt and pepper.

1  salt & pepper; to taste

Put 1st three ingredients in a non-reactive pan. Simmer for about 10
minutes. I skipped this step as I didn't use figs. I just simmered
and then wisked in the honey and mustard. Reduce by half. Brush on
butterflied trout and broil. We've done it on the grill too. Don't
cook it to long. I f you use the figs, take them out after you steep
them for about a half hour. Put them back in AFTER the reduction,
enjoy, This is from TIME-LIFE, HEALTHY HOME COOKING, Fresh Ways With
Fish and Shellfish. We first used it on trout and it is super and
easy, and as a bonus, low in calories. WW; 4 Pt; 40 cal ~-----------

True Cornish Pasties

pies, beef, lamb

      ----PASTRY----
3/4 cup butter, unsalted; cold
6 tablespoon shortening; chilled
3 cup flour, bread
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup ; water, ice (about)
      ----MEAT FILLING----
3  lamb kidneys
1/2 lb steak, fat free
2 medium potato
1 medium onion
1 large carrot
1  garlic clove
2 tablespoon parsley; chopped (opt)
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon pepper, black
1 large egg; beaten

Cut fat into the flour with a pastry blender or 2 knives or an
electric mixer until the mixture is blended and forms lumps the size
of peas. Rub mixture between your fingers until you have a fine
grained texture. Add just enough ice water to make it stick together
and quickly knead it into a smooth and shiny ball. Speed is
important. Cover and refrigerate for 60 minutes before rolling out.
Halve the kidneys and remove film and fatty core.  Dice the kidneys
and steak very fine. Peel and chop the vegetables equally as fine.
Mix well in a bowl with parsley and spices. Preheat the oven to 375
degrees F.  Roll out the unsweetened pastry to a thickness of 1/8
inch and cut into 3-inch rounds with a cookie cutter. Put a spoonful
of the meat mixture in the center of the rounds. Paint the edges
lightly with water.  Cover with the remaining rounds, pinching the
edges together very firmly.  Prick well with a fork.  Place on a
baking sheet and paint with the egg.  Bake 30 minutes.

Twice-Fried Shredded Beef

beef, chinese

3/4 lb beef sirloin or flank steak
      ----MARINADE----
2 tablespoon dry sherry
2 tablespoon soy sauce
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 small carrot
1  green bell pepper
2  ribs celery
1 small onion
      ----SAUCE----
2 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon chili oil
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch

Preparation: Trim and discard fat from beef. Cut beef across the
grain into 1 1/2-inch matchstick pieces. Combine marinade ingredients
in a medium-size bowl. Add beef; stir to coat. Set aside for 30
minutes.

Cut carrot, bell pepper, and celery into 1 1/2-inch matchstick pieces.
Thinly slice onion.  Set vegetables aside separately.

Combine sauce ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.

Cooking: Set wok in a ring stand and add oil to a depth of 1 1/2 to 2
inches. Place over high heat until oil reaches about 375 degrees F.
Add beef, half at a time, and deep fry for 1 minute until browned,
turning occasionally.  Lift out and drain on paper towels; set aside.
Cook remaining beef.

Remove all but 2 Tablespoons oil from wok.  Reheat oil over high heat
until hot.  Add carrot and onion; cook, stirring constantly, for 1
minute. Add bell pepper and celery; stir-fry for 1 more minute. Stir
in sauce and beef. Cook and toss until well mixed.

Tips: There should be just enough sauce to coat ingredients. It is
easier to slice beef thinly if it is partially frozen.

Tzimmes & A Gahtzah Tzimmes

beef, jewish

1 lb beef plate brisket
2 lb carrots
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon brown sugar
1  einbren or thickening:
2 tablespoon flour
2 tablespoon schmaltz (rendered chicken fat) or; shortening
1 cup carrot stock

From "Love and Knishes".

"Tzimmes" is a word impossible to translate. Ask anyone, "What is a
tzimmes?" and you get the answer, "You don't know what a tzimmes is?"
This is not very satisfactory as you can see.

The closest I have come to an answer is that a tzimmes is a mishmash.
Now a mishmash is a hodgepodge and a hodgepodge is...not a tzimmes,
believe me...it's a big thing in anyone's life. A Gahntze Tsimmes is
really somethig to boast about--a big production! For instance, from
a good tzimmes, a cook is entitled to make a gahntze tzimmes. (Some
people think of a tzimmes as a dessert). In my opinion is a one dish
meal usually served as the fourth course in a six-course dinner. A
Tzimmes can be made from almost any ingredient. From my wall-to-wall
carpeting I could make a tzimmes, and from my new mink coat I am
justified in making a gahntze tzimmes.

Of course, there are some people who think not. You will find people
who will begrudge you anything. They will say, "She's got a mink coat
so she's making from it a gahntze tsimmes. I knew her when she only
had a Persian lamb."

From all these things you can make a tzimmes, but most tzimmeses are
made from carrots.

Carrot Tzimmes

Simmer brisket in water to cover till almost tender (about 1 1/2
hours). By this time the water will have boiled down to about half
the original amount. Peel carrots and slice in half-inch rounds. Add
carrots, salt and sugar to meat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and
simmer till carrots are very tender (about 45 minutes). Brown flour
in a very small skillet, stirring constantly to prevent burning. When
flour is very light brown, remove from burner. Add schmaltz and stir
till smooth. Gradually stir in carrot stock to make a smooth paste.
Add this paste to the carrots, stirring it carefully. Continue to
simmer till stock has thickened (10 to 15 minutes.

meats

1 lb veal, cubed medallions
2 oz shallots
1 tablespoon pepper
2 oz honey
2 oz white wine
1 oz butter
1 tablespoon salt
4 oz dijon mustard
8 oz heavy cream

The cut of veal you use will make a difference in the length of
time it takes to cook this.  If you use stew meat, plan on letting it
stew in its juices for up to 1 hour. If you use medallions or better
cuts, it will go quickly.
In a heavy bottomed pan saute the butter and shallots and add the
vea or medallions.  The cubes need to simmer, the medallions will be
five minutes or so. Remove meat from pan and hold. Deglaze the pan
with a little wine. Mix the mustard and honey.  Add the cream and
reduce to desired thickness. Season with salt and pepper. Add sauce
to meat, heat back together and serve. Serves 2

piece of veal with a piece of prosciutto ham & a thin slice of lemon.
Serve. Note: Make sure the fat in the skillet is quite hot before you
add the breaded pieces of veal, otherwise the crumbs will absorb the
fat.

Veal Marsala With Provolone

meats, european

2 lb veal cutlets
1  flour
1  salt & pepper
2 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon olive oil
4  mushrooms, fresh, sliced
1/2 cup marsala wine
4 tablespoon butter, cold
1  provolone cheese, sliced

Pound veal cutlets between sheets of waxed paper til about 1/4" thick.
Combine flour and salt & papper to taste.  Dredge cutlets in the flour
mixture.  Combine 2 Tbsp butter with the 2 Tbsp olive oil in a large frying
pan over medium high heat.  Cook cutlets until lightly browned- about 2-3
minutes per side.  Remove cutlets to a platter or pan suitable for use
under a broiler.  Place sliced mushrooms in the frying pan and cook until
tender, adding a little butter if needed. Add Marsala and reduce sauce to
about half of the original volume. Pre-heat broiler. Lower heat under the
frying pan to VERY low, or place pan in a larger pan of hot water. Whisk in
cold butter, 1 Tbsp at a time, adding each just before the last is
completely incorporated. Remove sauce from heat immediately when done.
Place a slice of provolone on each cutlet and broil until cheese bubbles
and just starts to brown. Serve sauce alongside the cutlets, or spoon over
as they are served.  (This type of sauce will separate if it becomes too
hot at any point- mine always does :) ).

Other ideas:  Use chicken in place of veal.  Place a slice of prosciutto on
the chicken or veal, then the slice of cheese before broiling.

Veal Parmigiana***

main dish, meats, italian

1 1/2 lb veal cutlets sliced thin and pounde; d (except for fish)
4  beaten eggs, lightly salted
1  dry bread crumbs (seasoned or plain; )
1  olive oil for frying
1  grated cheese and slices of mozzare; lla (1 per cutlet)

*(can be used for chicken, turkey, or fish fillets) Dip each cutlet
into egg, breadcrumbs, and quickly into egg again. Put into hot, but
not smoking olive oil. (If oil is too hot cutlets will burn before
they cook; if oil is not hot enough, cutlets will soak up oil and
breading will not stick.) Cook each one about 3-4 min. on each side
until golden brown. Drain well on paper towels or brown bags. When
all cutlets are done, arrange in a shallow baking dish. Ladle sauce
on top of each one to mostly cover it, but don`t let it swim in
sauce. Generously sprinkle with grated cheese. Top with mozzarella
slices and bake in oven for about 20 min. until cheese melts. Serve
hot with pasta on the side.

Veal Pot Roast

meats

3 tablespoon bacon fat or salad oil
2  garlic cloves, cut in half
1  veal - 1/2 leg or: 3 or 4 lb rolled; shoulder of veal
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon thyme or:
1/2 teaspoon savory
1  bay leaf
6  potatoes - medium (6-8)
6  onions - medium (6-8)

Melt or heat bacon fat or oil in cast iron saucepan. Stuff the 2
cloves of garlic, cut in two, into incisions made in the veal. Place
the meat in the hot fat and brown well on all sides. Don't rush this
as the colour and flavour of the finished gravy will depend on how
well the meat has been browned. Add the thyme or savory and the bay
leaf. Place the potatoes and onions, whole around the meat. Don't add
any liquid. Cover tightly and cook over medium heat till meat is
tender, about 2 hours. The potatoes and oniions will not break as
there is no liquid added. The veal will make its own gravy. When
cooked, remove the meat from the pan to a heated platter. Place the
pan over high heat and stir gently, so as not to break up the
vegetables. When they are well coated with gravy, boil another
minutes or so till the gravy has a nice consistency. This is a
complete meal.

Veau Dans Le Chaudron (Veal Pot Roast)

meats, soups

3 tablespoon bacon fat or salad oil
2  garlic cloves, cut in half
1  veal - 1/2 leg or: 3 or 4 lb rolled; shoulder of veal
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon thyme or:
1/2 teaspoon savory
1  bay leaf
6 medium potatoes (6-8)
6 medium onions (6-8)

Melt or heat bacon fat or oil in cast iron saucepan. Stuff the 2
cloves of garlic, cut in two, into incisions made in the veal. Place
the meat in the hot fat and brown well on all sides. Don't rush this
as the color and flavor of the finished gravy will depend on how well
the meat has been browned. Add the thyme or savory and the bay leaf.
Place the potatoes and onions, whole around the meat. Don't add any
liquid. Cover tightly and cook over medium heat till meat is tender,
about 2 hours. The potatoes and onions will not break as there is no
liquid added. The veal will make its own gravy. When cooked, remove
the meat from the pan to a heated platter. Place the pan over high
heat and stir gently, so as not to break up the vegetables. When they
are well coated with gravy, boil another minutes or so till the gravy
has a nice consistency. This is a complete meal.

Venison Roast

beef

3 lb chunk of venison roast (or
1  roll it if its in steak
1  form)
2 cup onion - cut up (2 in.
1  pieces)
2 cup potato - cut up
1 cup carrots - cut up
1 cup fresh mushrooms - sliced
2 tablespoon liquid smoke
3 tablespoon (or more) worchestershire
1  sauce
3 tablespoon (or more) soy sauce
1/2 cup beef broth

Contributed to the echo by: Bob Lester Assorted Meat herbs (whatever
you like) Put a LARGE oven cooking bag in an oblong baking pan (so
that the bag fits inside the pan). To the bag, add the venison. Add
all liquids, then veggies around the meat. Put the 'shrooms on top of
everything else, then the spices on top of them. You want to have
about 1 inch of liquid in the bottom of the bag, so if you need more,
add a little water (or white wine!).

Seal bag. Poke several small holes in top of bag to let steam escape.
Bake at 300-325 for 3-1/2 hours. (If you chop the veggies big, they
won't overcook).

Venison Sauces

meats, ethnic, sauces

1/4 lb sugar
1/2 pint champagne vinegar
1  sweet sauce:
6 oz white or red currant jelly
6 oz white or red wine

Sharp Sauce:

Sharp Sauce:--A quarter-pound of the best loaf-sugar, or white
candy-sugar, dissolved in a half-pint of Champagne vinegar, and
carefully skimmed.

Sweet Sauce:--Melt some white or red currant jelly with a glass of
white or red wine, whichever suits best in color; or serve jelly
unmelted in a small sweetmeat-glass.  This sauce answers well for
hare, fawn, or kid, and for roast mutton to many tastes.

Gravy for Venison:--Make a pint of gravy of trimmings of venison or
shanks of mutton thus:  broil the meat on a quick fire till it is
browned, then stew it slowly. Skim, strain, and serve the gravy it
yields, adding salt and a teaspoonful of walnut pickle.

Venison With Currants & Chanterelles

meats

2 lb venison meat, boned; cubed o
2 cup veal stock; or water
3 cup red wine
1 tablespoon dried onion; crushed
2  cl garlic; crushed
1 teaspoon salt
1 lb fresh currants; --or--
1 cup currant jelly
4 oz fresh chanterelles; or 2 oz.
2 tablespoon arrowroot
1  mixed w. 1/3 cup water

Recipe by: plgold@ix.netcom.com (Pat Gold) 1. "Hot-marinade" the
venison by combining it with the water or stock, wine, onion, garlic,
and salt, and bring all these ingredients to a boil. Let them simmer,
covered, for 1 hour, or until the venison is tender.

2.  Add currants or currant jelly and chanterelles, and bring back to
a boil.  Thicken with the arrowroot-and-water mixture. The use of
currant jelly instead of fresh currants will make a slightly sweeter
sauce. Adjust for salt, and serve with rice.

Notes: Currants are a favorite in European cooking because they
combine fruitiness with acidity. Chanterelles are the best mushrooms
to use with game because of their almost fruitlike flavor.

Serve with apricot rice and a Sterling Vineyards Merlot.

Serves 4.

Vindaloo

meats, ethnic, indian

1 tablespoon coriander seeds
1 tablespoon poppy seeds
1 tablespoon red mustard seeds
1 tablespoon cumin seeds
1/2 cup corn or peanut oil
2 tablespoon dried hot red chili flakes
1 tablespoon ginger, fresh; grated
4  garlic cloves; ground to a paste
1 lb pork, boneless; cut in 2 cubes
1 lb beef, boneless; cut in 2  cubes salt, to
1/2 cup vinegar

"Vinegar is a preservative & therefore the vindaloo may be kept in the
refrigerator for several days before using. In fact, the flavour are
intensified if the vindaloo is eaten one or two days before cooking,
warm slightly. ... The vindaloo requires that a substantial amount of
oil be used in the preparation. For our purpose & without
compromising the flavor, I have suggested that the excess oil be
poured off before dining. Toasting & grinding the whole spice seeds
is the old-time method & very effective in deriving the most flavor.
However, I have also lightly toasted ground spices, which is an
improvement over using them directly from the container. The recipe
is one prepared by the Bhatia Christians of Calcutta, a group of
Anglo-Indians who have intermarried with Bengali Indians."

Lightly toast the coriander, poppy, mustard seeds, & cumin seeds in a
dry skillet for 2 or 3 minutes until the aroma is released. Grind the
seeds in a processor to a fine powder. Set aside. Heat the oil in a
pan & add all the toasted dry spices, the chili flakes ginger and
garlic. Stir fry over moderately low heat for 2 min. Add the meat &
stir continuously for 10 minutes as the meat browns. Add the water,
cover the pan & cook until the meats are tender, about 1 hour. When
the meats have been fully tenderized, add the vinegar & continue to
cook until the vinegar evaporates & the oil has risen. This is an
indication that the vindaloo is ready. At this stage, all the oil may
be poured off before serving. Serve warm with plain white rice &
masoor dal.

White Or Veal Stock

meats, vegetables, sauces

5 lb veal bones, cut up
10 cup cold water
2 large onions, quartered
3 large carrots, scrubbed, unpeeled, and
1  cut up
1  stalk celery, split
3 large leeks, well washed and split.
1  several sprigs of fresh thyme
1  several sprigs of fresh parsley
10  whole peppercorns

White stock is generally used as a base for delicately flavored
sauces. This stock adds little or no color to the final sauce.

Place the bones and water in a large stock kettle. Bring to a boil
and skim well.  Add the remaining ingredients, turn the heat down to
low, and simmer for 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Strain through a cheesecloth
lined strainer and allow to cool; then skim off the fat, and chill.
The cold stock will be quite gelatinous.

White Osso Bucco

meats

8 slice veal shank, each about 1 1/2 - 2 in; ches thick
1/4 cup olive oil
1/3 cup butter, unsalted
3 cup white wine, dry (or less)
1  lemon
8 tablespoon parsley (fresh), chopped fine
1  flour, salt and pepper

Dredge the veal shank pieces well in flour.  In a large skillet with high
sides, heat the olive oil and butter over moderately high heat until the
butter stops foaming.  If you do not have a skillet large enough to
accommodate all of the meat in a single layer, use two smaller pans.

Add the veal shanks to the skillet and arrange in a single layer. Cook over
moderately high heat until browned on one side. Add a generous amount of
salt and pepper. Turn meat and brown the other side, and add salt and
pepper.

Add enough white wine to nearly, but not quite, cover the meat. Reduce heat
to a barely bubbling simmer. Cover with a well-fitting lid. Cook at a
simmer for 2 1/2 hours.

Peel a thin layer of rind from the lemon.  (I find that a vegetable peeler
gives me a nice thin layer of rind.)  Cut rind into fine strips.

Remove veal shanks to a warm plate.  The meat will be falling-off-the-bone
tender, so a wide spatula is advised for this step to keep each shank
intact. Keep meat warm through the next several steps.

Add lemon peel and chopped parsley to the sauce and place over high heat.
Boil vigorously for several minutes to reduce sauce slightly. Stir to
loosen any brown bits from the pan and then frequently to prevent burning.

Remove from heat and return shanks to skillet.  Spoon sauce over shanks and
replace skillet lid.  Let sit for 3-5 minutes to reheat shanks. Serve with
sauce over shanks.

NOTES:

*  Braised veal shanks in white wine -- This recipe is adapted from
Marcella Hazan's "More Classic Italian Cooking." Simple to make, this dish
beats any "traditional" osso bucco with tomatoes and vegetables that I've
had in the U.S. or Italy.

*  Veal shanks are a relatively inexpensive cut of meat.  If possible, ask
your butcher to use hind shanks which have more meat than do the forelegs.
The key to this dish is the quality of the ingredients. I use the best
olive oil (Italian, virgin first-press, cold-press) and table quality dry
white wine (fume or sauvignon blanc) I can find at a reasonable price.

*  For dredging, rather than using a plate of flour, I put about 2/3 cup
flour in a plastic bag, put in the shanks one at a time, and shake to
thoroughly cover all sides of the meat with flour.

*  The flavor of the dish is light so I usually serve with a home-made
pasta dish with a cream-based sauce and a steamed green vegetable. Be sure
to have plenty of crusty bread on hand to soak up the sauce. For those who
like the marrow, don't forget to spoon it out of the shanks.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 3 hours cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

Whole-Meal Rib Soup *** (Rsch32c)

soups, beef, ethnic

2 tablespoon sesame seeds; crushed, toas
2 lb beef short ribs; cut into 2
3 cup beef broth
6 cup water
1/3 cup soy sauce
3 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoon garlic; minced
3 each sl ginger; fresh
1/2 teaspoon red pepper; ground (cayenn
4 each green onions; tied in a bun
1/4 lb daikon; peeled, and thinly
1 tablespoon sesame oil
3 each egg

I checked the subject list under Asian Cooking, and didn't see any I
recognized as this soup. I didn't have time to check each one
individually, so I hope this doesn't duplicate what you already have.
This is from the "Sunset Oriental Cookbook". Thinly sliced green
onion, including tops Prepare sesame seeds;place in a 5-6 qt. kettle
and add ribs, broth, water, soy, sugar, garlic, ginger,pepper, and
whole onions. Bring to a boil over med. heat;cover, reduce heat, and
simmer till beef is tender (2 1/2 -3 hrs.) Lift out ribs, and let
cool. Lift out and discard ginger and onions. Skim and discard fat
from broth. When ribs are cool, discard bones and fat; then shred
meat with fingers. Return meat to broth and add daikon. Bring to boil
over med. high heat;cover,reduce heat,and simmer till daikon is
tender to > bite (10-15 min.). Add oil. Gently break eggs, one at a
time, into barely simmering broth;cover and cook just till eggs are
softly set ( about 2 min.). Ladle soup and eggs into individual
bowls, and sprinkle sliced onions over top. Makes 3 or 4 servings. I
hope this helps. I haven't had this for a while, and I'm waiting for
cool weather. And in Texas, I've got a ways to wait!!!!! Carla in

Wiener Schnitzel

meats, german

4 oz veal slices (per person), milk fed,; pink in color,
1/4  inch thick
1  olive oil
1  lard
1  salt
1  flour
1  beaten eggs (1 egg per two slices v; eal)
1  fine dry bread crumbs

Trim all fat from veal. Pound each slice as thin as possible (about
1/8 inch thick). Make small vertical cuts all around the edges of the
veal. Salt each slice. Dip first into a soup plate containing flour,
and shake off excess; next into a soup plate of beaten egg; finally
into a soup plate containing dried bread crumbs, pressing crumbs well
in with the palm of your hand, then shaking off excess. Fry in deep
fat, half olive oil, half melted lard, so hot that it smokes, for 2
to 3 minutes on each side, or until heat is right when the breading
ripples golden brown. Schnitzel is done and tender when a fork goes
right through the meat. Serve garnished with lemon wedges and
potatoes or salad as a side dish.

Wined Chicken In Deluxe Gravy

meats, poultry, chicken, wok, oriental

1  fryer (3-4 pound in weight)
1 large onion, cut into wedges
1 cup fresh mushrooms, sliced or
1/2 cup canned mushrooms
1/2 cup celery, sliced or
1  celery stalk, sliced
1/2 cup water chestnuts, sliced
4 tablespoon oil
1/4 cup soya sauce
1/4 cup wine
1 1/2 tablespoon corn starch, dissolved in
1/3 cup water

1. Take your Chinese cleaver and chop through bone of chicken to form
chunks of chicken, about 2x2". Marinate all chicken chunks in wine,
soya sauce, salt for at least 20 minutes. In the meantime, slice all
the other ingredients and have ready for cooking.

2. If your wok is small, you will have to divide your chicken into 2
batches and cook each batch seperately. If your wok is large enough
to hold all the chicken, then place 4 tablespoons oil in it, heat to
smoking point, add all of the chicken and onions to it, stir fry and
brown chicken on all sides with wok uncovered. This will take about
10 minutes. At the end of this period, cover wok and cook chicken a
further 10 minutes.

3. Uncover wok, add clery, mushrooms, water chestnuts, stir everything
well. Cover wok and cook ingredients 3 minutes, uncovering wok, once
to give things a stir. Mix starch solution up well, add to wok, stir
everything up thoroughly.

NOTE: If your wok is small, cook the chicken in two batches. Remove
both batches of chicken to a serving platter. Leave chicken juices in
wok. Cook vegetables and make gravy in it. When vegetables and gravy
are cooked, pour over chicken. This dish can be used as a main dish
in Canadian cuisine, by not cutting up the chicken so fine.

until pork is browned.  Place wok cover over pork and cook another
2-3 min, making sure that the meat is thoroughly cooked. Uncover wok,

Woodruff Special

beef

4  slices bacon
1  cabbage leaves (1/4 head)
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cup rice, cooked
1 can sauerkraut (large can, well
1  drained)
1 quart spaghetti sauce
1 lb chopped beef
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1  garlic salt to taste
1  salt and pepper to taste

DIRECTIONS Fry the bacon fairly crisp and reserve it. Use the bacon
fat to grease a pan or casserole (a 10" x 12" x 2" pan is just about
right for this recipe). Tear cabbage leaves as necessary to line the
bottom of the pan, about 2-3 leaves thick. Break up the chopped beef
and crumble on top of the cabbage leaves. Crumble the bacon pieces on
top of the beef. Add the chopped onion, and then add salt, pepper,
garlic salt and oregano. Cover this with the cooked rice and then the
sauerkraut. Cover with another layer of cabbage leaves, about 2-3
leaves thick. Finally, pour the spaghetti sauce on top, distributing
it evenly.
Bake, covered at 325 degrees for 3-4 hours.

Wyoming Polish Sausage, Salami And Smoked Venison

ethnic, game, makemeat

1 x no ingredients

Take 17  pounds of lean, fat-free venison and 17  pounds of lean, fresh
pork.  Your mixture has to be this half-and-half mixture to be reallly
good. (It will be dry without the pork.) Grind up the meaats and mix them
together thoroughlly.  Mix in 4 oz. of water.

Now mix in 1 1/2 oz.  of black pepper, one oz. of ginger, 1 1/2 oz. of
nutmeg, 1/2 oz. of allspice, 1/2 oz. paprika, 2 level ts. of garlic
powdeer, (if you do not like garlic, substitute 4 level ts. of onion
powder), 12 oz. of salt and
1/2    pound of dried milk.

If you do not want to go to the trouble of making the meat into sausages,
simply wrap it in opound packages in aluminum foil and freeze it for safe
keeping.  To use it ssimply make upp into patties and fry like hamburger or
hamburger steak.  It is delicious.

To make up into ssausages you can do it in ttwo different ways, depending
on where you have smoking equipment or ot.  Either method is equally good.

1. If you do not have smoking equipment proceed as follows.

Mix in 3 level ts. of liquid smoke (Check the instructions on the liquid
smoke bottle as the amount necessary to use varies from brand to brand.
Herter's French-Canadian Liquid Smoke is best.)

Stuff the meat in casings if you have them.  Keep the links about 6-8
inches long.  If you have no casings, simply make the meat iinto patties.
This workds just as well.

Smoking is just a baking process.  Put what you will use for 2 weeks in
your refrigerator.  Wrap the balance iin aluminum foil and freeze.

2.  If you have smoking equiipment proceed as follows.

Stuff the meaat in casing if you have them.  Keep the links about 6-8
inches long.  Keep the links connected until they are dry.  If you do not
have casings, make up the meat into patties and place them on metal trays
or wiire screen that will go in your smokehousse or smoker. Smoke over a
low maple, apple, messquiite or hickory wood fire from 4-6 hours. Keep the
fire low at about 120 degrees.  This is not hot enough to cause much
dripping or shrinking.

Remove and put a two week's supply in your refrigerator.  Wrap the balance
in aluminum foil and freeze at once.

To cook, put the patties or sausages in a frying pan and add enough water
to cover up 1/3 of the way on them.  Put a cover on the fryingpan and boil
for 15 minutes.  Remove, pourout the water from the frying pan and then put
the patties or sausages back into the frying pan and brown them slightly on
all sides.  Makes wonderful eating.

York Pot Roast~ Spiced

beef, penn dutch

5 lb beef
1 each onion, sliced
3 each bay leaf
1 teaspoon peppercorns, black
1 single vinegar
1 single water
1 single salt & pepper

*** My notes: I used red wine vinegar and marinated the meat in the
refrigerator for a little over 24 hours. I added a little red wine
when making the gravy. Rub the meat thoroughly with the salt and
pepper and put in an earthen dish. Add the onion, bay leaves and
peppercorns. Take equal parts of vinegar and water and pour over the
meat. Let stand in this liquid for 24 hours. Put meat in a roasting
pan and sear well in oven at 400-F. When well browned, add a little
of the spiced vinegar. Cover pan tightly and cook slowly for 3-1/2
hours or until meat is tender. Add more of the vinegar if necessary.
When cooked, remove meat to a platter and thicken liquid with 1 Tbsp
flour. Source: Pennsylvania Dutch Cook Book - Fine Old Recipes,
