      Title: Amy's Crusty Italian Loaf
 Categories: Baker, Breads
      Yield: 3 servings
 
    1/4    Cup, (2 ounces) very warm
           Water (105 to 115 degrees)
    3/4 ts Active dry yeast
      1    Cup, (8 ounces) cool water (
     75    Degrees)
  1 1/2    Cups, (12 ounces) Sponge
           Starter, recipe follows
  3 1/2    Cups, (16 ounces) unbleached
           Allpurpose flour
      1    Tablespoon, plus 1 teaspoon
           Kosher salt
 
  Combine the warm water and yeast in a large bowl and stir with a fork
  to dissolve the yeast.  Let stand for 3 minutes.
  
  Add the cool water and sponge starter to the yeast mixture and mix
  with your fingers for about 2 minutes, breaking up the sponge.  The
  mixture should look milky and slightly foamy.
  
  Add the flour and salt and mix with your fingers to incorporate the
  flour, scraping the sides of the bowl and folding the ingredients
  together until the dough gathers into a mass.  It will be wet and
  sticky, with long strands of dough hanging from your fingers.  If the
  dough is not sticky, add 1 tablespoon of water.
  
  Move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5
  minutes, until it becomes supple and fairly smooth.  This is a
  sticky, wet dough; don't be tempted to add more flour to the work
  surface. Just dust lightly and use a dough scraper as necessary to
  loosen the dough from the table during kneading.  Allow the dough to
  rest for 15 minutes, covered with oiled plastic wrap.  (This rest
  period is the autolyse.)
  
  Knead the dough 3 to 5 minutes, until it is stretchy and smooth, yet
  still slightly sticky.  Shape the dough into a loose ball, place it
  in a lightly oiled bowl, and turn the dough in the bowl to coat with
  oil. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough rise
  at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees) for about 1 hour, or until the
  dough looks slightly puffy but has not doubled.
  
  Place the dough in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours, or
  preferably, overnight to let it relax, develop flavor, and become
  more manageable.
  
  Take the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room
  temperature for 1 to 2 hours, until it begins to warm up and starts
  to rise.
  
  Flour a work surface well and gently dump the dough onto it.  Divide
  the dough into three equal pieces, about 13 ounces each.  Gently
  flatten one piece, pressing out some of the air bubbles, and stretch
  it into a rectangle.  Fold the top third down and the bottom third up
  as if you were folding a business letter.  Now form the loaf into a
  short baguette by rolling the dough over from left to right and
  sealing the seam with the heel of your palm.  Fold the dough over
  about 1/ 3 of the way each time, seal the length of the loaf, then
  repeat. You want to gently draw the skin tight over the surface of
  the loaf while leaving some air bubbles in the dough.
  
  Seal the seam, being careful not to tear the skin of the dough or
  deflate its airy structure.  Do not elongate.  These loaves are about
  10 inches long.  Cover an area on the work surface with a thick layer
  of flour and place the loaf, seam side down, on the flour. Repeat
  with remaining pieces of dough.  The loaves will be loose and
  slightly irregular in shape. Leave plenty of space between the
  loavesthey will spread as they rise. Cover the loaves with welloiled
  plastic and let them rise for 1 to 2 hours, until bubbly and loose.
  
  Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Place a
  baking stone in the oven to preheat and position an oven rack just
  below the stone.
  
  Sprinkle a peel very generously with cornmeal.  Line an upsidedown
  baking sheet with parchment paper and sprinkle very generously with
  cornmeal. Lift one loaf, flip it over so the floured side is on top,
  and gently tug on the ends to stretch the loaf to the full length of
  the peel, or about 14 inches on a pan.  Repeat with the remaining
  loaves, placing 2 on the peel and 1 on the pan.  Dimple each loaf
  with your finger in about 6 places, but don't deflate them too much.
  Be sure the loaves are loosened from the peel, then carefully slide
  them onto the baking stone.  Place the pan of bread on the rack below
  the stone.  Using a plant sprayer, quickly mist the loaves with water
  8 to 10 times, then quickly shut oven door. Mist the loaves again
  after 1 minute.  Then mist again 1 minute later.
  
  Bake for about 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 450 degrees
  and bake 15 minutes longer or until the loaves sound slightly hollow
  when tapped on the bottom and the crust is a medium to dark brown.
  (If the crust is not brown enough, the loaves will soften as they
  cool.) Transfer the bread to a rack to cool for at least 30 minutes
  before serving.

      Title: Bear Claws, Danish Twists, Danish Pockets
 Categories: Desserts, Emeril
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Basic Danish dough
    1/2 c  Egg wash
    1/2 c  Almond filling
    1/2 c  Blanched almonds, crushed
    1/2 c  Apricot glaze
    1/2 c  Whipped sweetened cream
           Cheese
    1/4 c  Raspberry jam
    1/4 c  Blueberry jam
 
  **Divide the dough in thirds. A separate recipe for each type of
  Danish is preferred. Increase the fillings for each type. This recipe
  makes about 6 of each, depending on size of Danish.
  
  Bear Claws:
  
  Roll the dough out to 1/8-inch thick.  The longer the dough the more
  claws yielded.  Egg wash the entire piece of dough.  Spread a thin
  layer of almond filling horizontally down the center third of the
  dough. Fold the bottom third of the dough up to cover the filling.
  Fold the top third of the dough down, like your folding a business
  letter. Egg wash the dough. Sprinkle with crushed almonds.  Cut
  2-ounce portions. Make three slashes into the side of each portion,
  and spread gently into a horse-shoe shape to separate the toes. Proof
  until dough in size about 15-20 minutes. Bake until golden brown,
  about 10-12 minutes. Brush with apricot glaze.
  
  Danish twists:
  
  Roll the dough 1/8-inch thick. The longer the length the more twists
  yielded. Egg wash the dough lightly, sprinkle the entire surface with
  cinnamon sugar. Fold the dough in half from top to bottom. Slice
  2-ounce strips with a pastry wheel. Twist loosely into desired
  shapes. Place on a baking sheet. Egg wash each twist. Proof until the

      Title: Big Beautiful White Pan Loaves
 Categories: Baker, Breads
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/4    Cup, (2 ounces) very warm
           Water (105 degrees to 115
           Degrees)
  1 3/4 ts Active dry yeast
  4 1/2    Cups, (20 1/4 ounces)
           Unbleached allpurpose flour
  2 1/4 ts Kosher salt
  1 1/4 c  Plus 2 tablespoons, (11
           Ounces) cool water ( 75
           Degrees)
 
  In a small measuring cup, mix the warm water and yeast with a fork to
  dissolve the yeast.  Let stand for 3 minutes.
  
  Mix the flour and salt together in a large mixing bowl.  Add the yeast
  mixture and the cool water.  Using your fingers, mix the dough into a
  sticky mass.
  
  When all of the flour is incorporated, move the dough to a lightly
  floured work surface and knead for 4 minutes.  The dough should be
  sticky and will not look smooth.  If the dough feels stiff or dry,
  knead in additional cool water, a tablespoon at a time.
  
  Put the dough in a lightly floured bowl, cover, and let rest for 20
  minutes.
  
  Return the dough to the lightly floured surface and knead it for 7 to
  8 minutes.  The dough will go from being sticky to smooth and will
  become supple but not too firm.
  
  Place the dough in a clean bowl lightly dusted with flour.  Cover the
  bowl with a towel and allow the dough to rise at room temperature (75
  to 77 degrees) for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, until it doubles in volume. (An
  indentation made by poking your finger deep into the dough should not
  spring back.)
  
  Place the dough on a very lightly floured surface.  Gently deflate the
  dough and pat it into a rectangle.  The short sides should be the top
  and bottom edges.  Fold the top edge down and the bottom edge up,
  overlapping them slightly, then turn the dough a quarter turn and
  fold the top down and the bottom up again to form an envelope. Shape
  the dough into a log shape by rolling the loaf down two to three
  times and sealing the seam with the heel of your palm. Roll the loaf
  back and forth on the table to smooth out.
  
  Place the loaf seam side down in a lightly oiled 9 by 5 inch loaf pan.
  Gently press down on the loaf to spread it to fill the corners of the
  pan, and cover it with oiled plastic wrap.
  
  Let the loaf rise at 75 degrees to 77 degrees for about 1 to 1 1/4
  hours, or until it has doubled and risen about 1-inch above the edge
  of the pan.
  
  Meanwhile preheat oven to 425 degrees.
  
  Gently place the loaf pan on the center rack of the oven.  Using a
  plant sprayer, quickly mist the loaf with water 6 to 8 times, then
  shut the oven door.  After 3 minutes, mist the loaf again.
  
  Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees
  and bake for 30 minutes longer, or until the top is a deep golden
  brown. Remove the loaf from the pan it should come out with ease. The
  bread should sound slightly hollow when tapped on the bottom, and the
  sides of the loaf should be brown.  Immediately place the loaf from
  the pan on a wire rack to cool. Serve slightly warm, with butter and
  lots of homemade jam!

      Title: Chocolate Rolls
 Categories: Baker, Desserts
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 ts Active dry yeast
    1/4 c  (2 ounces) very warm water
           (105 to 115 degrees F)
           Scant 1/3 cup plus 1/4
        ts (2 ounces) granulated sugar
      3 c  Plus 2 tablespoons (14
           Ounces) unbleached
           All-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Unsweetened cocoa powder
  1 1/2 ts Kosher salt
      1 c  (8 ounces) warm brewed
           Coffee (90 degrees F)
      1 lg Egg yolk
      2 ts Unsalted butter, softened
    2/3 c  (4 ounces) chocolate chips
    1/2 c  (4 ounces) cold water
  1 1/4 ts Cornstarch
 
  Two 12 by 17-inch baking sheets, lined with parchment paper
  
  Place the yeast and warm water in a large bowl.  Stir with a fork to
  dissolve the yeast and allow it to stand for about 3 minutes.
  
  Whisk the unbleached flour, cocoa powder, the remaining 1/3 cup sugar
  and the salt together in a medium bowl.  Set them aside.
  
  Using your hand, stir the coffee, the egg yolk, and the butter into
  the dissolved yeast.  Gradually add the flour mixture, stirring until
  a shaggy mass forms and all of the flour is moistened.
  
  Move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 7 to 8
  minutes, until it is silky smooth and elastic.  This dough should be
  nice and moist, so add flour sparingly as you work.  Shape the dough
  into a loose ball cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest for
  about 10 minutes to relax the gluten strands.
  
  Flatten the dough and stretch it gently with your fingers to form a
  rectangle about an inch thick.  Spread the peanut butter chips evenly
  over the rectangle.  Fold the dough into an envelope and knead gently
  for 2 to 3 minutes, until the chips are well distributed. The dough
  should be soft, smooth, and springy.  If the dough resists, let it
  rest for 5 minutes and then continue kneading it. Some of the chips
  may pop out of the dough, but they can easily be incorporated again
  after the first rise when the dough has softened.
  
  Shape the dough into a loose ball and place it in a lightly oiled
  bowl. Turn to coat the top of the dough with oil, and cover the bowl
  tightly with plastic wrap.  Let rise at room temperature (75 to 77
  degrees F) until the dough has doubled in volume, about 2 hours.
  
  Line two 12 by 17-inch baking sheets with parchment paper.  Gently
  pour the dough onto the floured work surface pressing any loose
  chocolate chips into dough.  Flour your hands lightly divide the
  dough into 12 equal pieces (each weighing about 2 1/2 ounces). Shape
  the pieces into rolls and place 6 on each prepared baking sheet
  leaving several inches between the rolls so they won't grow together
  as they rise. Cover them loosely with oiled plastic wrap and let them
  rise at room temperature until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes to
  1 hour. While the bread is proofing make a cornstarch wash:  Put the
  cold water in a small saucepan and whisk in the cornstarch.  Bring to
  a boil, stirring frequently until it thickens. Remove from the heat
  and cover to keep a skin from forming.  Set aside to cool.
  
  About 15 minutes before you're ready to bake, place one oven rack in
  the top third of the oven, and another in the bottom third, and
  preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
  
  When the buns have doubled, use a pastry brush to paint them with a
  thin coating of the cornstarch wash.  Brush gently so you don't
  deflate them. Place one pan on each oven rack.  Using a plant
  sprayer, immediately mist the top and sides of the oven 6 to 8 times
  and quickly close the oven door.  Repeat this misting procedure two
  more times at 1-minute intervals.
  
  Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees
  F and rotate the pans from top to bottom and front to back to ensure
  even baking. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes longer, or until the tops of
  the buns feel firm but not hard when you press them slightly, and the
  bottoms are very lightly browned.  These rolls should have a thin
  soft covering, not a hard crunchy crust.  Remove from the oven and
  use the pastry brush to paint the top of each bun quickly and evenly
  with the cornstarch wash. Transfer the rolls to a rack and allow them
  to cool before serving. These are best eaten the day they are baked.

  flour, using a rubber spatula.  Spoon a little of the batter into
  each of the prepared cups top with 1truffle, and cover with the
  remaining batter. Arrange cups on a baking tray and bake until edges
  of the cakes begin to pull away from the sides of the cups, 12 to 13
  minutes. Let stand 10 minutes.  Invert onto individual dessert plates
  and carefully peel off paper.
  
  Serve warm Spoon softly whipped cream or ice cream next to each cake
  and, if desired, garnish with a few fresh raspberries.  Serve

      Title: Christmas Bombe
 Categories: Desserts, Tvfn
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      6 oz Fresh cranberries
    1/4 c  Plus 2 tablespoons sugar
    1/4 c  Raspberry preserves
           Hot Milk Sponge Sheet, baked
           And cooled, recipe above
           White Chocolate Mousse with
           Kirsch, recipe above
    1/2 c  Strained apricot preserves
      2    To 3 tablespoons minced
           Unsalted  pistaschios
 
  Special Equipment: One 6 cup bombe mold or bowl with similar capacity
  (the one I use is 7 1/4 inches in diameter and 3 1/2 inches deep) One
  7-inch round corregated cake circle
  
  Make Cranberry-Raspberry Puree:  Rinse and pick over cranberries and
  combine with sugar in small nonreactive saucepan.  Cover and bring to
  simmer over medium heat.  Uncover, raise heat and stir occasionally.
  Cook only a few minutes or until about three-fourths of the berries
  are burst, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat.  Press mixture through
  a medium-fine strainer or food mill along with the raspberry
  preserves. Discard tough dry pulp and raspberry seeds. Cool the puree
  completely before using. Puree may be made and refrigerated up to 1
  week in advance.
  
  Assemble and Freeze the Jelly Roll:  Reverse the Hot Milk Sponge
  sheet onto a piece of foil; peel off the parchment.  Turn sponge
  carefully over again (use a cookie sheet to aid you if sponge is
  delicate) so that brown side faces up.  Spread all of
  Cranberry-Raspberry Puree evenly over sponge. Roll up as tightly as
  possible to form a 16 by 17-inch long thin jelly roll. Wrap tightly
  in foil and freeze at least several hours or overnight--or up to 1
  month in advance of using.
  
  Line the Bombe with Jelly Roll Slices:  Remove frozen jelly roll from
  freezer and unwrap.  Trim ragged ends if necessary.  Use a sharp
  serrated knife to cut slices 1/4-inch thick.  Line the mold with the
  slices by placing one slice in the center of the bottom of the mold.
  Next fit 7 (or more) slices around the center pushing and fitting so
  that no space is left between the slices.  Fit the next 9 (or more)
  around the bowl starting up the sides.
  
  Finish by fitting about 10 slices to completely line the mold ,
  pushing and fitting so that no space is left Trim slices even with
  the rim of mold if necessary, or just push them so they are flush
  with the rim. Reserve trimmings and remaining slices and return them
  to freezer until needed. Set lined mold aside.
  
  Fill the Mold:  Make the White Chocolate Mousse with Kirsch.  Turn it
  immediately into the lined mold.  Level and smooth the surface of the
  mousse.  Remove the remaining slices of jelly roll and trimmings from
  the freezer.  Set aside just enough slices to completely cover the
  mousse if placed tightly together - But do not put them in place,
  yet. Dice the remaining slices and any trimmings with a sharp knife.
  Scatter the diced pieces all over the mousse, and then fit the
  reserved slices closely together over the scattered dice to form the
  bottom layer of the dessert
  
  Place the corregated cake circle (or a small plate) inside the mold
  and press firmly to level and compact the bombe.  Wrap and
  refrigerate at least 4 hours before unmolding and serving.  Bombe may
  be completed to this point up the 24 hours in advance of serving, or
  frozen up to 2 months.
  
  Unmold, Finish and Serve:  Invert the mold and rap the edge sharply on
  counter to release dessert.  Simmer strained apricot preserves in a
  small saucepan for 2-3 minutes to make a glaze.  Use a pastry brush
  to paint the entire dessert with glaze.  Touch bottom edge of bombe
  with minced pistachios.  Refrigerate until serving.

 Categories: Baker, Breads
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Big Beautiful White Pan Loaf
           Dough, 1 batch
  1 1/2 ts Cinnamon
      3 tb Sugar
  1 1/2    Cups, (7.5 ounces) dark
           Raisins,
      2 tb Unbleached all-purpose flour
 
  Mix one batch of the White Pan Loaf dough according to instructions
  given in recipe.
  
  Place the just mixed dough in a clean bowl lightly dusted with flour.
  Cover the bowl with a towel and allow the dough to rise at room
  temperature (75 degrees to 77 degrees) for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, until it
  doubles in volume. (An indentation made by poking your finger deep
  into the dough should not spring back.)
  
  While the dough is rising, place the raisins in a bowl or a plastic
  container and fill with warm water to come just below the top of the
  raisins.  (If you use too much water, you will rinse away the natural
  sweetness of the raisins.)
  
  Place the dough on a very lightly floured surface.  Gently deflate the
  dough and pat it into a rectangle that is about 3/4 of an inch thick,
  and about 6 inches by 12 inches in size.  The short sides should be
  the top and bottom edges.
  
  Mix the cinnamon and sugar together, and sprinkle it evenly over the
  dough.
  
  Drain the raisins and toss them with the remaining 2 tablespoons
  flour. Spread the raisins evenly over the dough and gently press them
  into it.
  
  Starting at a short side, roll the dough into a log.  Roll the dough
  tightly, keeping the skin of the dough slightly taut, and tucking in
  any raisins that fall out, but don't stretch the dough so tight that
  the skin tears.  Seal the seam of the log gently but tightly using
  the heel of your hand against the surface of the table, or pinch it
  shut with your fingers.
  
  Place the loaf in an oiled or buttered 9 by 5 inch loaf pan, and
  cover with oiled plastic wrap.  Let the dough rise at room
  temperature for 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, or until the loaf has risen
  almost 1 inch above the sides of the pans.
  
  Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
  
  Place the loaf pan on the center oven rack.  Using a plant sprayer,
  mist the loaf 8 to 10 times, then quickly shut the oven door.  Spray
  the bread again after 2 minutes.
  
  Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees
  and bake for 20 to 30 minutes longer, until the crust is deep brown
  and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.  The crust may
  color quickly because of the cinnamon and raisins in the dough; watch
  carefully and cover the top of the loaf loosely with foil if it is
  browning too fast. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then remove the
  bread from the pan and place the loaf on a rack to cool. Let cool
  completely before slicing, or the bread will fall apart. This bread
  keeps well for at least 2 days.

  it into a 6-inch square.
  
  Remove the dough from the fridge, lightly flour the work surface and,
  using either your hands or a rolling pin, shape the mass into 12-inch
  square. Place the butter on the dough catty-corner and fold the edges
  of the dough into the center to enclose it.
  
  Lightly flour the surface of the dough and roll it into a rectangle
  measuring about 12 inches high x 26 inches wide.  If the dough sticks,
  loosen it underneath with a long flexible metal palette knife and
  scrape off any butter sticking to the work surface.  Brush off any
  excess flour. Fold the dough into thirds and turn it 90 degrees, so
  that seams are parallel to the table's edge.  This is called a
  "turn". Lightly flour and roll it out again to about 12 x 26 inches.
  Brush off the excess flour and again fold it into thirds. Place the
  dough on a sheet tray, cover it with a plastic bag and refrigerate
  for 20 to 30 minutes.
  
  Repeat this, giving the dough two more turns, each time rolling it
  out to 12 x 26 inches.  Refrigerate for another 20 or 30 minutes,
  then give the dough 2 final turns.  There are six turns in all.
  
  Lightly roll it to flatten and even it.  Wrap it in plastic wrap or a
  bag and chill for at least two hours before using it.  It can be kept,
  refrigerated, for up to 3 days, or frozen for up to 3 months.
  
  Yield:  2- 3/4 pounds of dough
  
  To roll pastry:  (for home size 11 x 17-inch sheet trays)
  
  For thinly rolled dough (1/16-inch) used to make little pizzas start
  with 15 ounces (1/3 of the recipe).  For thickly rolled dough
  (3/8-inch) used for everything else, start with 22 ounces (1/2
  recipe).
  
  Line an 11 x 17-inch sheet tray with parchment paper.  On a floured
  table, roll the rectangle of dough to a length of 15 inches and a
  width of 10 inches.  Dust off any excess flour.  Roll the dough up
  onto the rolling pin and transfer it to the sheet tray.  Using a
  10-inch rolling pin and rolling gently from the center out, roll the
  dough to fit the tray. Make sure it is even - with no lumpy edges.
  Rolling lightly and gently enables you to keep it even.
  
  Shapes to cut out of the 3/8-inch thick dough:
  
  Bouchee:  Cut 2 (3-1/2-inch) rounds of dough.  Cut a 2-1/4-inch
  circle out of the second round.  Egg wash the first round.  Place the
  ring from the second round over the first so that the edges line up.
  Dock the edges and center with a fork.  Thin inner circle can be
  baked as well and used for a lid.
  
  Bouchee made from special cutter:  Use and cutter made especially for
  this purpose.  It has two cutting edges - one inside and shorter than
  the other that scores, rather than cuts the dough.
  
  Criss-cross Tartlet:  Cut a 5-inch square.  Fold it into a triangle
  and cut from each edge towards the apex, stopping about 1/2-inch
  short of the apex. The cut should be about 1/2-inch from the edge.
  Open it up to the square and place on a cookie sheet.  Egg wash the
  edges. Bring one point over to the opposite corner of the inner
  square and press. Bring the opposite point over and press.  Press
  along the rim to seal. Dock rim and center.
  
  Puff Strip:  From a sheet tray of frozen dough, cut a rectangular
  piece 8" wide and the length of the sheet tray.  Transfer it to a
  paper lined cookie sheet.  Using a pizza wheel, cut a 3/4" strip from
  each edge. Egg wash the edges of the center piece and flip the cut
  strips onto the egg washed edge. Dock the 2 rims with a fork, then
  dock down the center.
  
  Vol-au-Vent:  Similar to above, but round.  Press whatever size round
  you want into the dough on the sheet tray.  Lift and cut along the
  circular impression with a pizza wheel.  Center another round, and
  inch or so smaller in diameter than the first over the circle of
  dough and press lightly.  Remove and cut along this line.  Egg was
  the edge, as above, and cut through the outer rim in one place. Place
  the rim over the center circle, lining up the edges.  Dock the rim
  with a fork, then dock the center.  Bake 20 to 25 minutes in a
  preheated 425 degree F. oven.

      Title: Hot Milk Sponge Sheet
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Milk
      2 tb Sweet butter, cut into small
           Pieces
    3/4 c  Sifted cake flour
      1 ts Baking powder
    3/4 c  Sugar
      3    Egg yolks, room temperature
           Equipment:
     12 x  16-inch or 11 x 17-inch
           Jelly roll or half sheet
           Pan
 
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Line bottom of pan with waxed or
  parchment paper so that the paper overhangs the pan at two opposite
  ends.
  
  Heat milk with butter in small saucepan over medium heat until butter
  melts.  Reduce heat to low and keep hot but do not simmer.
  
  Sift flour with baking powder twice.  Return to sifter and set aside.
  In a large heatproof bowl, use a hand-held whisk to combine sugar,
  eggs and yolks.  Set bowl over or in a pan of barely simmering water.
  Warm the mixture, whisking occasionally, until it is lukewarm to the
  touch. (Alternatively, omit the water bath and hold the bowl directly
  over the stove burner, whisking vigorously for about a minute until
  the eggs are warm.  This is the quickest, easiest method but you must
  whisk the eggs continuously to keep them from starting to scramble).
  
  Transfer bowl to electric mixer; beat at high speed until mixture has
  cooled, tripled in volume and has the consistency of thick whipped
  cream.
  
  Sift one-third of flour mixture over batter and fold it gently, by
  hand, using the largest rubber spatula you have.  Fold in half the
  remaining flour; then fold in the remaining flour.
  
  Pour hot milk and butter into batter and fold well, scraping the
  bottom each time and bringing the batter up the sides of the bowl
  until you can no longer see traces of liquid.  Transfer batter into
  prepared pan and spread evenly.  Bake until cake is browned, starts
  to shrink from the sides of pan, and springs back when lightly
  pressed: about 10 minutes. Cool cake in pan, on a rack.  When cake is
  cool, run a small knife or spatula around the edges to release before
  unmolding. Cool completely before filling.

      Title: Lemon Blueberry Puff Tart
 Categories: Baker, Desserts
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Sheet tray of 3/8-inch thick
           Puff, frozen
    2/3 c  Fresh squeezed strained
           Lemon juice
    1/2 c  Sugar
      3    Eggs
      2    Egg yolks
      1 c  Blueberries
 
  Whisk the juice, sugar eggs and yolks together in a pot, being
  careful not to aerate it too much.  Cook over medium heat, stirring
  constantly but gently with the whisk.  Cook until it thickens and the
  whisk leaves light lines; it will still be quite liquid.  Do not let
  it boil. Strain it into a bowl and press plastic wrap onto the hot
  surface.
  
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Invert a 10-inch cake pan over the
  dough (towards the edge of the tray so you waste a minimum amount of
  dough) and press.  Lift off and use a pizza cutter to cut around the
  imprint of the circle.  Lift the circle of dough out and place on a
  cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.  Dock it.  Center the round
  metal bottom of 9-inch tart mold over the dough and press.  Cut
  around at 1-inch intervals to form a decorative "fringe".  Weigh the
  metal bottom down with heavy objects. (I place an 8-inch cake pan on
  top and fill it with stacked tartlet molds - about 3 1/2 pounds
  worth.)
  
  Bake about 18 minutes, until the edges are golden, then remove the
  weights and metal tart bottom.  Reduce heat to 350 degrees F. and
  bake for another 5 to 7 minutes, until the center is golden.  Remove
  from oven and spread the lemon curd evenly in the center.  Put back
  in the oven for 2 to 3 minutes to set the filling.  Remove from oven
  and scatter the berries around the outside edge of the lemon filling.
  Serve within an hour. Cut with a pizza wheel.

  hours under refrigeration.  Remove the bag from the refrigerator.
  Unwrap the pork and rinse off the cure.  Pat the pork dry.  Mound 2
  1/2 pounds of charcoal briquettes in the center of the grill and
  light them. Let burn for 40 minutes.  Add the chips and allow them to
  smoke for about 10 minutes. The interior temperature of the grill
  should be 300 degrees F. Place the pork near the outermost part of
  the grill rack. This is to avoid direct heat. You want the bacon to
  absorb the maximum amount of smoke flavor before it is fully cooked.
  Smoke the bacon for 30 minutes. Spray the coals as often as
  necessary, but remember smoke escapes each time the grill is
  uncovered.

      Title: Organic Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread with Oats and Pecans
 Categories: Baker
      Yield: 2 servings
 
           Sponge starter bread---
      1 ts Active dry yeast
    1/4 c  (2 ounces) very warm water
           (105 to 115 degrees F)
  3 3/4    Cups, or more if necessary
           (18 1/2 ounces) organic
           Whole wheat flour
  2 3/4 c  (12 1/2 ounces) organic
           Unbleached all-purpose flour
      2 c  (6 ounces) organic
           Old-fashioned rolled oats
      2 tb (3/4 ounce) Kosher salt
  1 1/2 c  (12 ounces) Sponge Starter
  2 1/2 c  (20 ounces) cool water ( 75
           Degrees F)
      3 tb (1 1/2 ounces) honey
      3 tb (1 1/2 ounces ) molasses
      2 tb (1 ounce) Canola oil (or
           Other vegetable oil)
      2 c  (8 ounces) pecan pieces,
           Toasted
           Additional rolled oats for
           Topping
           Two 9 by 5-inch loaf pans,
           Oiled
 
  Place the yeast and warm water in a large bowl and stir with a fork to
  dissolve the yeast.  Let stand for about 3 minutes.
  Whisk the whole wheat flour, unbleached flour, oats, and salt
  together in a medium bowl.
  Add the sponge starter, cool water, honey, molasses, and oil to the
  yeast mixture.  Mix with your fingers for 1 to 2 minutes, just long
  enough to break up the sponge (the mixture should look milky and be
  slightly foamy). Add the flour mixture to the bowl and stir with your
  fingers to incorporate the flour, scraping the sides of the bowl and
  folding the dough over itself until it gathers into a shaggy mass.
  Don't be concerned if the dough feels very sticky at this point.
  Lightly flour a work surface.  Remove the dough from the bowl and
  knead it for 6 to 8 minutes, until it becomes compact and elastic. It
  should be very moist but not mushy.  If it feels too stiff to knead,
  add water 1 tablespoon at a time until you have a soft, malleable
  dough. If it's sloppy wet and impossible to knead, add another 1/4 to
  1/3 cup (1 1/4 to 1 2/3 ounces) of whole wheat flour. Shape the dough
  into a loose ball and let it rest, covered with plastic wrap, on the
  lightly floured work surface for 20 minutes.  (This rest period is
  the autolyse.) Flatten the dough and stretch it gently into a
  rectangle about an inch thick.  Spread the pecans and raisins evenly
  over the dough. Fold the whole mass into an envelope and knead and
  fold it gently until the nuts are well distributed, about 2 to 3
  minutes.  If the dough resists, let it rest for 5 minutes and then
  continue kneading. Some of the nuts may pop out of the dough, but
  they can easily be incorporated again after the first rise, when the
  dough has softened. Shape the dough into a loose ball and place it in
  a lightly oiled bowl, along with any loose nuts.  Turn the dough to
  coat the top with oil, and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap.
  Let the dough rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees F) until it
  has doubled in volume, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  (You can also
  refrigerate this dough overnight and shape it and bake it the next
  day: Let it rise for 1 hour at room temperature, or until it looks
  slightly puffy but not doubled, before refrigerating. The next day,
  let it rise for 2 hours at room temperature before shaping it.) When
  the dough has doubled, loosen it from the bowl with lightly floured
  hands and gently pour it onto a floured work surface.  Press any
  loose pecans into the dough and divide it into 2 equal pieces. Shape
  each piece into a log.  Spread the oats for topping on a flat plate
  or baking sheet. Use a pastry brush or a plant sprayer to lightly
  moisten the top of each log with water, then roll the tops of the
  loaves in the oats. Place each loaf seam side down in an oiled 9 by
  5-inch loaf pan. Cover them with plastic wrap and allow to rise for
  about 2 hours, or until they have doubled in size (a finger pressed
  into the dough will leave an indentation).
  Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.
  Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat and place an empty water
  pan directly below the stone.
  When the loaves have doubled, place the pans on the baking stone.
  Quickly pour 1 cup of very hot water into the water pan and
  immediately shut the door.  After 1 minute, using a plant sprayer,
  mist the loaves quickly 6 to 8 times then shut the oven door.
  Repeat the misting procedure 1 minute later.
  Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees
  F and bake for 20 to 25 minutes longer, until the loaves sound
  slightly hollow when tipped out of the pan and tapped on the bottom.
  The sides and bottom of the loaf should feel firm and slightly
  crusty. If the tops are browned but the sides are still somewhat
  soft, place the loaves directly on the stone to bake for 5 to 10
  minutes longer. Transfer the loaves from the pans to a rack and allow
  to cool completely before slicing. -Comments: Mildly sweet and
  slightly crunchy, our version of whole wheat oatmeal bread is great
  for tuna sandwiches. Cut in thick slices, it's perfect for French
  toast. Shape it into rolls for a dinner party or a family picnic. For
  variety, add one and a half cups (seven and a half ounces) of golden
  raisins to the dough and shape half of it into twists; crusty and
  delicious, they're good for breakfast-on-the-go and afternoon snacks.
  This versatile bread is sure to become one of your favorites.

  roast the filets for 6 to 7 minutes for medium-rare. Remove from the
  filets from the pan and set aside. Place the sauté pan on the stove.
  Over medium-high heat, deglaze the pan with the port wine. Reduce the
  wine by half, about 5 minutes. Pour the vegetable oil in a sauce pan
  and heat the oil. Dredge the shallots in the flour, coating the
  shallots completely. Fry the shallots in the hot oil until golden
  brown, about 2 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain on a
  paper-lined plate. Season the shallots with salt. To assemble, divide
  the potatoes by four and mound the potatoes in the center of each
  plate. Lay each filet on top of the potatoes. Spoon the veal
  reduction over each filet. Drizzle each plate with the port wine
  reduction. Garnish each plate with the remaining Stilton cheese,
  fried shallots and parsley.

      Title: Pecan Sticky Buns
 Categories: Baker
      Yield: 9 servings
 
  2 1/4 ts Active dry yeast
    1/4 c  (2 ounces) very warm water
           (105 to 115 degrees F)
  5 1/3 c  (24 ounces) unbleached
           All-purpose flour
  2 1/4 ts Kosher salt
      2 c  (16 ounces) warm water (90
           Degrees F)
      9 tb (4 1/2 ounces) unsalted
           Butter
    1/2 c  Plus 1 tablespoon (5 ounces)
           Dark brown sugar, firmly
           Packed
      4 tb (2 ounces) unsalted butter,
           Softened
    2/3 c  Plus 1 tablespoon (2 3/4
           Ounces) pecan pieces,
           Toasted
    1/3 c  Plus 1 tablespoon (2 1/2
           Ounces) granulated sugar
      1 ts Cinnamon
 
  Equipment:  One 9-inch square baking pan, preferably non-stick,
  buttered on sides only; one sheet pan, lined with aluminum foil
  
  Place the yeast and warm water in a small bowl and stir with a fork to
  dissolve the yeast.  Allow it to stand for about 3 minutes.
  
  Mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl.  Add the warm water
  and the yeast mixture and stir with your fingers to moisten the
  flour, scraping the sides of the bowl and folding the dough over
  itself until it gathers into a shaggy mass.
  
  Move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it by hand for 5
  minutes.  This is a soft, moist dough.  If the dough seems too stiff
  and hard to knead, add extra warm water 1 tablespoon at a time until
  you get a nice malleable dough.  Gently shape the dough into a loose
  ball, cover it with plastic, and let it rest on the table for 20
  minutes. (This rest period is the autolyse.)
  
  Gently knead the dough on the lightly floured surface for 1 to 2 more
  minutes, or until it becomes smooth, supple, and elastic but not too
  firm. The texture of the dough should be soft but springy. Shape the
  dough into a loose ball, place it in a lightly oiled bowl, and turn
  to coat the top with oil.  Cover it tightly with plastic wrap and let
  it rise at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees F) until it has doubled
  in volume, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
  
  While the dough is rising; in a small saucepan, heat the 9 tablespoons
  butter and the dark brown sugar over low heat, stirring occasionally,
  until the butter has melted and the sugar is completely moistened (it
  won't be dissolved), then whisk until the mixture looks silky and a
  little lighter in color.  Use 1 tablespoon softened butter to grease
  the sides of a 9-inch square pan, then pour in the caramel, tilting
  the pan slightly so the mixture spreads evenly over the bottom of the
  pan. Sprinkle the toasted pecans over the warm caramel and press them
  down slightly. Put the pan in the refrigerator to cool the caramel;
  be the pan's on a level surface. Put the granulated sugar and
  cinnamon in a small bowl and stir until evenly mixed.  Set aside.
  
  When the dough has doubled, gently pour it out of the bowl onto the
  floured work surface.  Flatten the dough and stretch it with your
  fingers to form a 13 by 10-inch rectangle, with a longside facing
  you. Work gently so you don't tear the dough surface.  The dough
  should stretch easily at this point, but if it resists, let it rest
  for 5 minutes and resume stretching. Check to be sure the dough isn't
  sticking to the work surface; flour the table again, if necessary.
  
  Spread 3 tablespoons of the softened butter evenly over the dough,
  leaving a 1/2-inch strip unbuttered along the top edge.  Sprinkle the
  cinnamon/sugar mixture generously and evenly over the butter, again
  leaving the top 1/2-inch of the rectangle bare.  Starting with the
  bottom edge, roll up the dough jelly-roll fashion into a long log. If
  the dough sticks to the table as you're rolling, use a dough scraper
  to loosen it gently. Pinch gently but firmly along the seam to seal
  it. If necessary, gently shape the roll so it is a nice uniform log.
  
  Take the caramel-lined pan out of the refrigerator.  Cut the log of
  dough into 9 equal pieces.  (It's easiest to mark the roll first to
  show where you're going to make the cuts--a slight indentation with
  the knife edge will do--then use a sharp serrated knife to cut
  completely through the dough.)  Lay the pieces cut side down on top
  of the caramel. Don't worry if it's a tight fit.  Let rise,
  uncovered, at room temperature until the dough has almost doubled,
  about 1 to 1 1/4 hours. The rolls should fill the pan and extend 1/2
  to 3/4-inch above it. In the meantime, position a rack in the center
  of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Put the pan of
  sticky buns on a foil-lined baking sheet and place it in the oven.
  Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees
  F and bake for 30 to 40 minutes longer, until the tops of the buns
  are golden brown and crusty.  It's important to bake the buns long
  enough so the dough is cooked all the way through and the caramel
  topping develops properly. Set the pan of buns on a rack to cool for
  5 minutes. Then quickly but carefully turn the pan upside-down and
  release the sticky buns onto a large flat heatproof plate.
  Immediately scrape out any hot caramel remaining in the bottom of the
  pan and spread it on the tops of the buns, filling in any bare spots.
  Let them cool until just warm before serving. (Clean the pan by
  soaking it in very hot water to dissolve the caramel.) Store any
  leftovers covered in plastic wrap at room temperature.

      4 lg Pieces of plastic wrap
      1 c  Chopped walnuts, sauteed in

      2 tb Armagnac or cognac
      2 c  Beef or veal demi-glace
    1/2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Butter, at room temperature
 
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place each pork loin between 2
  pieces of plastic wrap.  With a beef mallet, lightly pound out the
  pork loin, very thin 1/6 to 1/8-inch thick.  Unwrap the pork loin and
  season both sides with salt and pepper.  Lay three slices of the
  bacon on a flat surface. Place the pork on top of the bacon along one
  end. Spread 1/4 cup of the duxelle over the top of each pork loin.
  Divide the avocado slices into fourths and lay the slices on top of
  the duxelle.
  
  Gently roll up each pork with the bacon.  Place the roulades on a
  baking sheet, seam side down,
  
  lined with parchment paper, and roast until the bacon is brown and
  crisp and the pork meat is tender, for about 30 minutes.  Remove from
  the oven and allow the roulades to rest for 5 minutes, before
  slicing. Using a very sharp knife, trim off the ends of each roulade
  and cut each across into 4 slices.  In a sauce pan, render the
  chopped bacon, until crispy for about 8 minutes.  Add the shallots,
  garlic, and Armagnac and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the demi-glace,

  tenderloin, leaving about 1/2-inch around the edges. Gently roll the
  tenderloin up, like a jelly roll. Using butchers twine, make several
  knots, about 2 inches apart. This will secure the stuffing and aid in
  overall cooking. In a large saute pan, heat the olive oil. Sear the
  tenderloin for 2 minutes on each side. Remove from the pan and set
  aide. After the fillet has cooled, rub the entire tenderloin with the
  mustard. Roll the entire tenderloin in the cracked black pepper,
  crusting the entire tenderloin. Line a baking sheet pan with
  parchment paper. Lay the tenderloin on the pan and roast for about 30
  to 35 minutes for medium rare. Remove from the oven and rest for 5
  minutes before slicing. With a carving knife, slice the tenderloin
  into fillets, about 2 inches thick. Yield: 8 to 10 servings

      Title: Roasted Habanero Salsa From Hell
 Categories: Sauces, World, Mexican
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 tb Virgin olive oil
    1/3 c  Virgin olive oil
      6    Ripe plum tomatoes, halved
           Freshly ground black pepper
     10    Habanero chile peppers
    1/4 c  Lime juice (about 2 limes)
    1/4 c  Chopped cilantro
 
  :       Combine tablespoon of olive oil and garlic and mix well.  Rub
  tomato halves with this mixture, sprinkle with salt and freshly
  cracked pepper and roast in 500-degree oven until they begin to take
  o some serious color, about 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove from oven, cool
  to room temperature and dice
  :       Meanwhile, grill habanero peppers over a medium-hot fire until
  slightly colored, 2 to 3 minutes.  Temove peppers from fire and
  mince.  Be very careful when working with this pepper.  Wear gloves
  when mincing it, and if you get any of the juice on your skin, wash
  it off with a mild bleach solution, which neutralizes the capsaicin.
  Also, be sure not to rub your eyes while working with these peppers,
  and wash your hands well after you're done.  These little guys are
  incendiary.
  :       In medium-size bowl, combine tomatoes, peppers, 1/4 cup olive
  oil, lime juice and cilantro, mix well, and prepare for takeoff.
  :       This salsa will keep, covered and refrigerated, about 5 to 6
  weeks, mainly because no mold or bacteria would dare to come near the
  stuff. Yields 2 cups. Source: "Salsas, Sambals, Chutney and

      Title: Rosemary Fougasse
 Categories: Baker
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Variation on the Crusty
           Italian Bread---
    1/2    Batch Amy's Crusty Italian
           Bread
      3 tb Fresh rosemary, chopped
 
  Mix the dough according to the instructions given in the recipe.
  
  After the dough has taken its first rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours (or
  overnight) it can be shaped into a fougasse.  Place the dough on a
  lightly floured surface and pat it into a long narrow rectangle.
  Sprinkle a layer of chopped rosemary over the surface of the dough
  being careful to cover the edges too.  Fold the dough in thirds like
  a business letter, the top third over the middle of the dough, then
  the bottom third over that, completely overlapping the two.  Press
  the 3 open sides of the fougasse tightly shut.  Cover the bread well
  with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 to 2
  hours.
  
  Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Place a
  baking stone in the oven to preheat and position an oven rack just
  below the stone.
  
  Sprinkle a peel or upsidedown baking sheet generously with cornmeal
  and place the fougasse
  
  on top, stretching it slightly to make it into a square.  Cut a
  decorative pattern, such as a leaf or a ladder, into the dough with a
  dough cutter. Spread and stretch the loaf until the cuts form large
  openings.
  
  Be sure the fougasse is loosened from the peel, then carefully slide
  it onto the baking stone.  Using a plant sprayer, quickly mist the
  bread with water 8 to 10 times, then quickly shut oven door.  Mist
  again after 1 minute.  Then mist again 1 minute later.
  
  Bake for about 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 450 degrees
  and bake 15 minutes longer or until the loaf sounds slightly hollow
  when tapped on the bottom and the crust is a medium to dark brown.
  (If the crust is not brown enough, the bread will soften as it
  cools.) Transfer the bread to a rack to cool for at least 30 minutes
  before serving.

  few places with a knife to release large air bubbles. Smooth the top
  with a spatula and tap on a counter twice to release air bubbles.
  Bake 1 to 1 1/4 hours, until a skewer inserted in the center comes
  out dry.  Cool on a rack while preparing the glaze. To make the
  glaze, combine the butter, sugar and water in a small saucepan. Bring
  to a boil and let boil 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in
  the rum. To glaze, poke a few deep holes in the cake with a skewer or
  toothpick. Brush on one-third of the glaze.  Invert the cake onto a
  baking pan and remove the cake pan.  Brush the remaining glaze over
  the top, sides and down the center.  Let cool completely before

      Title: Sponge Starter
 Categories: Baker
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  (12 ounces) very warm water
           (105 to 115 degrees)
    1/4 ts Active dry yeast
  3 1/2 c  (16 ounces) unbleached
           All-purpose flour
           One 2-quart clear plastic
           Container
 
  Mix all the ingredients together in a medium bowl and stir vigorously
  with a wooden spoon for 2 to 3 minutes, until a smooth, somewhat
  elastic batter has formed.  The batter will be very stiff; it gets
  softer and more elastic after it has proofed.  You may find it easier
  to mix the sponge using electric mixer, with a paddle or a dough
  hook, on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes.  Scrape the sponge into a
  2-quart clear plastic container and cover with plastic wrap. At this
  point you have two options:
  
  If you plan to make your dough later that same day, let the sponge
  rest at room temperature until it has risen to the point where it
  just begins to collapse.  This may take from 6 to 8 hours, depending
  on the temperature of the sponge, the temperature of the room, and
  the strength of the
  
  yeast.  The sponge will triple in volume and small dents and folds
  will begin to appear in the top as it reaches its peak and then
  begins to deflate.  The sponge is now in perfect condition to be used
  in a dough. It's best if you have already weighed or measured out all
  of your other recipe ingredients before the sponge reaches this point
  so you can use it before it collapses too much.
  
  If you're not planning to make your dough until the next day or the
  day after, put the covered sponge in the refrigerator and let it rise
  there for at least 14 hours before taking it out to use in a recipe.
  Be sure to compensate for the cold temperature of the starter by
  using warm water (85 to 90 degrees) in the dough instead of the cool
  water specified in the recipe.  Or let the starter sit out, covered,
  until it reaches room temperature (this may take several hours)-but
  don't let it collapse to much before you use it.

      Title: Stinging Nettle Tagliatelle with Hot Sausage and Kale
 Categories: Molto
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           GREEN PASTA---
      4    Extra large eggs
      6 oz Frozen chopped spinach,
           Defrosted and squeezed very
           Dry
  3 1/2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
           Plus extra for dusting work
           Surface
    1/2 ts Olive oil
      8 oz Fresh spicy Italian sausage
           With fennel seeds, cut into
    1/4    -inch
           Pieces
    1/2 lb Kale, finely chopped to
           Yield about 4 cups
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 c  Freshly grated Pecorino
           Cheese
 
  Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting
  board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, oil
  and spinach. Using a fork, beat together the eggs, oil and spinach
  and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the
  well.
  
  As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well
  shape. Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.  The dough
  will come together when 1/2 of the flour is incorporated.
  
  Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your
  hands primarily.  Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough
  from the board and scrape up any left over crusty bits.  Lightly
  flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes.  The dough
  should be elastic and a little sticky.  Continue to knead for another
  3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the
  dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room
  temperature. Note: do not skip the kneading or resting portion of
  this recipe, they are essential for a light pasta.
  
  Heat 6 quarts water to boiling in a spaghetti pot and add 2
  tablespoons salt.
  
  In a 10-inch to 12-inch saut‚ pan, cook sausage over low heat until
  fat begins to render, about 6 minutes.  Turn heat up to medium and
  cook until most of fat from sausage has rendered out and sausage is
  golden brown. Add kale and chicken stock and cook until very soft,
  about 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and remove from
  heat.
  
  Drop pasta into boiling water and cook until tender (about 1 minute).
  Drain pasta and toss into saut‚ pan with kale and sausage. Cook over
  high heat until coated, about 1 minute.  Add grated cheese and toss
  to mix. Pour into heated serving bowl and serve.
  
  Green pasta recipe:  substitute steamed nettles for steamed spinach,
  or add 1/2 cup dried nettles and increase egg by 1.

      Title: The Baguette
 Categories: Baker
      Yield: 3 servings
 
  1 1/4 ts Active dry yeast
    1/4    Cup, (2 ounces) very warm
           Water ( 105 to 115 degrees
           F)
      3    Cups, (13 1/2 ounces)
           Unbleached allpurpose flour
      1    Cup, (4 1/2 ounces) cake
           Flour (see note)
  2 1/4 ts Kosher salt
  1 1/4 c  Plus 1 tablespoon, (10 1/2
           Ounces) cool water ( 75
           Degrees F)
 
  Combine the yeast and the warm water in a small bowl and stir with a
  fork to dissolve the yeast.  Let stand for 3 minutes.  Combine the
  flours and salt in a large bowl.  Pour the cool water and the yeast
  mixture over the flour, and mix with your fingers to form a shaggy
  mass. Move the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead for
  4 minutes. It should be supple and resilient, but not too smooth at
  this point. Let the dough rest on the work surface for 20 minutes,
  covered with plastic wrap or a light towel. (This rest period is the
  autolyse.)
  
  Knead the dough for 6 to 8 minutes.  Don't overknead it:  The dough
  should be smooth, stretchy, and resilient.  Place the dough in a
  lightly oiled bowl, turn it in the bowl to coat with oil, and cover
  it with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature ( 75 to 77 degrees
  F) for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until nearly doubled in volume.
  
  Gently deflate the dough and fold it over itself in the bowl. Reshape
  it into a ball and cover with plastic wrap.  Let it rise for 1 1/4
  hours or until it has nearly doubled again.  Gently deflate the dough
  again, reshape into a round, cover, and let rise for about 1 hour.
  Place the dough on a very lightly floured surface and divide it into
  3 equal pieces (about 10 ounces each).  Gently stretch one piece into
  a rectangle, leaving some large bubbles in the dough. Fold the top
  third down and the bottom third up as if you were folding a business
  letter. Now form the loaf into a log by rolling the dough over from
  left to right and sealing the seam with the heel of your palm.  Fold
  the dough over about 1/ 3 of the way each time, seal the length of
  the loaf, then repeat.  You want to gently draw the skin tight over
  the surface of the baguette while leaving some air bubbles in the
  dough.  Seal the seam, being careful not to tear the skin of the
  dough or deflate its airy structure. Set aside on the work surface to
  relax before elongating it, and repeat the shaping process with
  remaining pieces of dough.
  
  Now elongate each baguette, starting with the first one you shaped, by
  rolling it back and forth on the work surface.  Begin with both hands
  over the center of the loaf and work them out to the ends until the
  loaf reaches the desired length.  (Don't get carried away, or the
  baguettes won't fit in your oven!)  Place the finished loaves on a
  peel or upside down baking sheet lined with parchment paper and
  generously sprinkled with cornmeal or on a baguette pan.  Cover the
  loaves with well oiled plastic or a floured cloth and let rise for 30
  to 40 minutes until the loaves are slightly plump but still not
  doubled in volume. The final rise is short, because you want the
  baguettes to be slightly under proofed; this will give them a better
  oven spring, resulting in loaves with a light, airy crumb and more
  flared cuts.
  
  Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 500 degrees F.
  Place a baking stone in the oven to preheat, and place an empty water
  pan directly under the stone.  Use a very sharp razor blade or lame
  to make 3 to 5 slashes, depending on the length of your loaves, on
  the top of each baguette.  The cuts should run from one end of the
  loaf to the other, rather than across it, and the blade should be
  held at a 30 degree angle to the loaf so that the cuts pop open in
  the oven. Be careful not to press down too hard, or you may deflate
  the loaves. Using a plant sprayer, mist the loaves.
  
  Gently slide the loaves onto the preheated stone, or place the
  baguette mold in the oven.  Pour 1 cup of very hot water into the
  water pan and quickly close the oven door.  After 1 minute, mist the
  loaves and oven walls 6 to 8 times and close the door.  After 2 more
  minutes, spray the loaves and the oven walls again.
  
  Bake for 12 minutes, then lower the oven temperature to 400 degrees F
  and bake for 25 to 30 minutes longer until the loaves are golden
  brown and crisp.  Move them to a rack to cool.
  
  Enjoy your baguettes still slightly warm with some soft, ripe French
  cheese and a glass of wine.
  
  Note:  If cake flour is not available, you can use the same amount of
  unbleached allpurpose flour, but cake flour will give the baguette a
  lighter texture.

      Title: Toasty Seeded Bread Sticks
 Categories: Baker
      Yield: 12 servings
 
           Variation on the baguette
    1/2    Recipe baguette dough
    1/3    Cup, (3 ounces) sesame seeds
    1/4    Cup, (2 ounces) poppy seeds
      2    To 3 tablespoons extra
           Virgin olive oil
           Kosher salt for sprinkling
 
  Mix the baguette dough using the instructions in the recipe.  Divide
  the dough in half and use the other half for baguettes.  Dust your
  work surface with flour and place the kneaded dough on the floured
  surface. Cover the dough with oiled plastic wrap and allow it to rise
  at room temperature (75 to 77 degrees F) for 1 hour.  The dough will
  be soft but will not have doubled.
  
  Combine the sesame and poppy seeds in a small bowl.  Pat the dough
  into an even 4 by 6 inch rectangle.  Using a plant sprayer,
  generously mist the dough.  Coat both sides of the dough completely
  with the seed mixture; make sure there are no bare spots.  Gently
  brush the dough on both sides with olive oil and sprinkle it with
  kosher salt.
  
  Line 2 baking pans with parchment paper and oil the paper lightly.
  Stretch the rectangle so that it is a little longer.  Using a dough
  cutter, cut the dough width-wise into twelve strips, almost 1 inch
  wide. Lift each stick, stretch it slightly so it's 8 inches long and
  lay it on the baking sheet. Place the sticks on the baking sheet with
  about 1 inch between them. Let rise for 30 minutes, until they become
  slightly puffy but not quite fully doubled.
  
  Thirty minutes before baking, preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place a
  baking stone in the oven to preheat and place an empty water pan
  directly below the stone.  Place the pan of bread on the baking
  stone. Quickly pour 1 cup of very hot water into the water pan and
  immediately shut the oven door. After about 1 minute, mist the sticks
  with water 6 to 8 times, then quickly shut the oven door. Mist again
  after 1 more minute.
  
  Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees
  F and bake 8 to 12 minutes longer, until the sticks look golden brown
  and are getting crisp on the outside.  Brush the hot bread sticks
  with a little olive oil if desired, then transfer them to a rack to
  cool for a few minutes before serving.

      Title: Vegetable Puff Pizzalini
 Categories: Baker
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/3    Recipe puff pastry (about 15
           Ounces)
           Olive oil (preferably
           Infused with garlic)
      1 md Onion, diced
           Kosher salt
           Fresh ground pepper
      2    Or 3 small tomatoes (about 2
    1/4    -inches diameter)
    1/4    Head broccoli
      8 md Cremini or Button mushrooms
           (about 1 1/4-inch caps)
           Grated Parmesan cheese
           Olive paste (optional)
 
  Roll the puff pastry into a rectangle 11 x 15 inches.  Transfer it to
  a 11 x 17-inch sheet tray lined with parchment paper and fit the
  dough to the tray exactly.  Be sure the dough is evenly rolled -
  about 3/8-inch thick. Freeze the sheet tray for about 1/2 hour.
  
  Remove the tray from the freezer and using a fluted 2 1/4-inch round
  cutter, cut out 24 to 28 circles.  Using a fork, dock each round well
  in the center, 4 to 6 times; leave a 1/4-inch rim undocked. The
  circles can be put back in the freezer for up to 2 months.  Once
  they're frozen, they can be stacked and wrapped in plastic wrap.
  
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Heat some oil in a pan and cook the
  onions slowly, until they are soft and fully cooked.  Season with
  salt and pepper. Set aside to cool.  Slice the tomatoes about
  3/8-inch thick. Cut off broccoli flowers about 1 1/4 inches around.
  Cut them as close to the flower as possible, without them falling
  apart. Cut the stems off the mushrooms flush with the bottom of the
  cap (don't hollow them) and slice as thinly as possible.  Fill a
  little bowl with about 1-inch of oil.
  
  Place the rounds of dough, upside down on a papered cookie sheet and
  dock again.  Brush about 1/3 with oil, spread about 1/3 with a little
  olive paste or pesto, and spoon about 1/2 of the cooled onions on the
  remaining rounds.  Sprinkle each with Parmesan.
  
  Place a tomato slice on the rounds spread with oil only; the slice
  should be the same size or a little smaller than the round of dough.
  Garnish with a few strips of fresh basil.
  
  Dip each broccoli flower into the oil, head down, and press it,
  flower up, into the center of each round spread with olive paste.
  
  Press a sliced mushroom cap into the center of each onion round.
  Slant the cap a little so that the slices separate.
  
  Brush each round generously with oil and sprinkle generously with
  Parmesan, salt and pepper.  Bake for about 17 minutes or until the
  bottoms are lightly browned.  Serve warm.

  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
  
  For the beans, in a large saucepan, melt the butter over high heat and
  saute the onions and celery for 3 to 4 minutes, or until they are
  slightly wilted.  Add the beans, salt, cayenne, water and bay leaf
  and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until beans
  are tender and most of the water is absorbed, about 2 hours.
  
  For the meats, in a large oven-proof skillet, over medium-high heat,
  combine the flour and oil.
  
  Stirring constantly, make a medium brown roux.  Add the onions,
  celery, bell peppers, carrots, salt and cayenne.  Stirring
  constantly, cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until vegetables are slightly
  wilted. Lay the venison on top of the roux-vegetables mixture and
  cook for 2 minutes on each side. Add the sausages and cook for 2 to 3
  minutes on each side. Add the chicken broth and stir the mixture
  until the roux and broth are combined and mixture thickens.  Scrape
  the bottom and sides of the pot to loosen any brown particles. Bring
  to a boil. Add the beans and reduce heat to medium-low and cook for
  30 minutes.
  
  For the Gratin:  In a mixing bowl, combine the bread crumbs, cheese,
  parsley, Essence and olive oil.  Mix well.  When the bean-meat
  mixture is cooked, spoon the gratin evenly over the top and bake for
  10 minutes or until lightly browned.

           Flour for kneading
           Egg wash----
      1 lg Egg white beaten with 1 tsp
           Water
 
  Pour the lukewarm water into a large bowl and sprinkle on the yeast.
  Wait 5 minutes, then stir in the honey and 3 1/2 cups of the whole
  wheat flour. Stir the mixture vigorously for 1 minute, then cover it
  with plastic wrap and set this sponge aside in a warm, draft-free
  spot for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, stir the salt, oil, and the 2
  cups of finely chopped toasted walnuts into the sponge.  Stir in the
  remaining whole wheat flour 1/2 cup at a time until you have a
  kneadable dough; you may have to work the last bit of whole wheat
  flour into the dough with the back of a wooden spoon.
  
  Flour your work surface with some of the unbleached flour and turn the
  dough out onto it.  With floured hands, knead the dough for 10
  minutes, using as much of the unbleached flour as necessary to keep
  the dough from sticking; don't knead too roughly, because this dough
  is a little sticky. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning
  it to coat the entire surface.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and
  set the dough aside in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in bulk,
  1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Lightly butter 2 large, heavy baking sheets,
  preferably dark ones, and set them aside. Once the dough has doubled,
  punch it down and knead briefly, then divide the dough into quarters
  (or half if you're making 2 larger loaves.) Working with one piece of
  dough at a time, knead it into a ball.  Put 1/2 cup of the remaining
  untoasted chopped walnuts on a piece of wax paper. Brush the entire
  surface of the dough with the egg white wash, then roll the dough in
  the nuts, coating the whole thing.  Place the ball seam down on the
  baking sheet.  Repeat for the other pieces of dough, coating each one
  with 1/2 cup nuts.  It isn't necessary to cover the loaves, but put
  them aside in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in bulk, 40 to 50
  minutes.  About 15 minutes before that point, preheat the oven to 375
  degrees. Bake the loaves for 45 minutes, then transfer them to a rack
  to cool before slicing. Store leftovers in a plastic bag. Note: If
  you're making 2 loaves, use 4 1/2 by 8 1/2 inch loaf pans. Coat each
  with 1 cup of untoasted nuts, if you like, before placing them in the
  pans. Or knead the halves into balls, coat them with walnuts, and
  
  Grains by Ken Haedrich.  "This bread is full of walnuts - inside and
  outside with walnut oil to accentuate the dominant theme It bakes up
  dark and dense and slices nice and thin for sandwiches It would be
  right at home on holiday buffet table, next to a cold cut platter or
  some cream cheese spreads.  This bread makes great toast too If you
  plan to use this bread as a family loaf, not for gifts or parties,
  you might want to skip the extra step of the walnut crust "

      Title: White Chocolate Mousse with Kirsch
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      9 oz White chocolate cut into
           Very small pieces
      2 tb Water
      3 tb Kirschwasser
  1 1/2 c  Heavy whipping cream
 
  Place chocolate, water, and Kirschwasser in a medium size heatproof
  bowl. Bring 1 inch of water to a simmer in a wide skillet.  Turn the
  heat off and wait 30 seconds.  Set bowl of chocolate in pan of water.
  Stir white chocolate mixture constantly until melted and smooth. Or,
  melt in a microwave on low for about 2 minutes.  Stir until smooth
  and completely melted.  White chocolate is very fragile and burns
  easily. Do not turn the heat on again under the skillet unless
  absolutely necessary. Let cool until a dab touched by your upper lip
  feels slightly cool.
  
  Whip the cream until soft peaks form--not too stiff.  Carefully fold
  cream into cooled white chocolate mixture; the mousse will seem very
  soft. Scrape mold immediately into lined mold.  Mousse sets quickly
  and should not be spread or manipulated too much after it is
  completed.

  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Butter a inch round cake pan. Coat
  the bottom and sides with the toasted almonds.
  
  In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer at low

  grated citrus zests. Add the eggs, egg yolks and vanilla extract. Mix
  thoroughly, frequently scraping down the sides of the bowl, until the
  batter is perfectly smooth.
  
  Pour the batter into the prepared pan, tapping the bottom on a
  counter four or five times to eliminate air pockets.  Place the cake
  pan inside a large roasting pan and pour in hot tap water until it
  reaches halfway up the sides of the cake pan.  Bake 1 hour, or until
  the center feels firm when pressed.  Immediately remove the cake pan
  from the larger pan and set aside to cool on a rack.  Refrigerate 4
  to 6 hours or overnight.
  
  To serve, place the pan over a low burner for about 1 minute to melt
  the butter.  Invert onto a plate and then invert again onto a serving
  platter so the nuts are on the bottom.  To garnish, if desired,
  spread the sour cream evenly over the top and then cover the top with
  rows of thinly sliced kumquats.

    1/2 c  Lukewarm water
    1/2 c  Buttermilk, room temperature
    1/2 c  Water
      2 ts Vanilla
      2 lg Eggs, room temperature
      4 oz (1 stick) unsalted butter,
           Room temperature
      1 c  (200 grams) granulated sugar
      1 c  (200 grams) light brown
           Sugar, packed
 
  Adjust rack in lower third of oven and preheat oven to 350/F. Grease
  and flour two 8 inch round cake pans, and insert parchment paper or
  waxed paper to line the bottoms.
  Sift the flour, baking soda, and salt onto a sheet of waxed paper and
  set aside. Place the cocoa in a 1quart mixing bowl. Add the 1/2 cup
  lukewarm water, and whisk to combine; set aside to cool. Pour the
  buttermilk, the 1/2 cup water, and the vanilla into a liquid cup
  measure. Crack the eggs into a small bowl, and whisk together to
  combine the yolks and whites. Place the butter in the bowl of a
  heavyduty mixer, preferably fitted with a flat beater. Cream the
  butter on medium speed until the butter is smooth and lighter in
  color, about 30 to 45 seconds. Reduce the speed to low and add the
  sugars in a steady stream. When all the sugar is added, stop the
  machine and scrape the mixture clinging to the side of the bowl into
  the center. The mixture will appear sandy. Increase the speed to
  medium again, and cream until the mixture is light in color, is
  fluffy in texture, and appears as one mass, about 6 to 7 minutes.
  With the mixer still on medium speed, pour in the eggs slowly at
  first. Continue to cream, scraping the sides of the bowl at least
  once, until the mixture appears fluffy and velvety. Stop the machine
  and spoon in the cooled cocoa mixture, resume at medium speed and mix
  just until incorporated. Using a rubber spatula, stir in one fourth
  of the flour mixture. Then one third of the buttermilk mixture,
  stirring to blend together. Repeat this procedure, alternating dry
  and liquid. With each addition, scrape the sides of the bowl, and
  continue mixing until smooth, never adding liquid if any flour is
  visible. Pour the batter into the pans and spread it level. Bake for
  25 minutes, or until the baked surface springs back slightly when
  touched lightly in the center and the sides contract from the pan.
  Place the cake pans on a rack to cool for 5 to 10 minutes. With
  mitts, tilt and rotate pans, gently tapping them on the counter to
  see if the cake releases from the sides.
  
  Yield: 2 8 inch layers
  
  AGNATE FILLING
  
  8 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
  1 cup heavy cream
  
  Put the chocolate in a medium bowl. In a small saucepan, heat the
  heavy cream just to the boil. Remove from heat. Pour over chocolate
  and whisk until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth and shiny.
  ASSEMBLING THE DESSERT:
  Split each layer of cake in half horizontally and place one layer,
  cut side up, on a cardboard round. Spread with one third of the
  ganache filling. Center a second layer on top of the first, and
  spread it with one third of the ganache filling. Place another layer,
  cut side up, on top, and spread with remaining filling and turn the
  last layer upside down, and center it over the filling.
  FROSTING AND CHOCOLATE GLAZE:
  
  1 cup heavy cream, whipped
  10 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped
  1 cup heavy cream
  
  Frost the cake with the whipped cream. Place the cake on a wire rack,
  then set it on a sheet pan that will fit the dimensions of your
  freezer. Place in the freezer for 40 minutes only (this is just
  enough time to chill the whipped cream frosting so its firm to the
  touch, not soft). While the cake is in the freezer, prepare the dark
  chocolate glaze. Put the chocolate in a medium bowl. In a small
  saucepan, heat the heavy cream just to the boil. Remove from heat.
  Pour over chocolate and whisk until chocolate melts and mixture is
  smooth and shiny. Set aside to cool to body temperature. Set the cake
  on its wire rack over a baking pan with sides (like a jelly roll pan)
  on top of a turntable (or lazy susan). Pour almost all of the
  chocolate glaze over the center of the cake. Using a long, flexible
  metal icing spatula, use just a few strokes to spread the glaze over
  the top of the cake so the glaze runs down over the sides. Rotate the
  turntable as you spread. Use the spatula to scoop up excess glaze to
  touch it to any bare spots on the sides of the cake to cover them.
  Place the cake on a serving plate. Refrigerate until 30 to 60 minutes
  before serving. Using a serrated knife, dipped into hot water after
  each slice, cut dessert into wedges.

      Title: Chapatis
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  Atta flour (or whole wheat,
           Sifted)
      1 ts Salt
           Approximately 1 cup warm
           Water
 
  You will need a medium-sized bowl, a rolling pin, a castiron griddle
  or heavy skillet, and a small cotton cloth or a paper towel.
  
  In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the salt and the flour.  Make a
  well in the middle and add just less than 1 cup warm water.  Mix with
  your hand or with a spoon until you can gather it together into a
  dough (depending on the condition of your flour, you may need a
  little extra water or a little extra flour to make a kneadable
  dough). Turn out onto a lightly floured bread board and knead for 8
  to 10 minutes. Cover with a damp cloth or a plastic wrap and let
  stand for 30 minutes or for up to 2 hours. The longer the dough
  stands, the more digestible the breads.
  
  Divide the dough into 8 pieces and flatten each with lightly floured
  fingers.  Continue flattening with a rolling pin until each piece is 8
  inches in diameter.  Once you have started rolling, roll out each
  bread without flipping it over.  To keep the bread from sticking to
  your bread board, make sure that the bread is lightly floured
  underneath. Cover the breads with the damp towel or plastic wrap as
  you roll out others (make sure not to stack the rolled out breads; if
  you don't have enough counterspace for the breads, roll out just a
  few and begin cooking, rolling out the others as the breads cook).
  
  Heat a castiron griddle or skillet over medium-high heat.  When the
  griddle is hot, place a chapati on the griddle, top side of the bread
  down first. Let cook for only 10 seconds and then gently flip to the
  second side. Cook on the second side until small bubbles begin to
  form, approximately one minute.  Turn the chapati back to the first
  side and finish cooking (another minute approximately). At this
  stage, a perfect chapati will start to balloon.  This process can be
  helped along by gently pressing on the bread.  The bread is hot, so
  we find the easiest method is to use a small cotton cloth or a paper
  towel wadded up to protect your finger tips. Gently press down on a
  large bubble forcing the bubble to extend itself wider. If the bread
  starts to burn on the bottom before it has ballooned, move the bread
  (with the help of your paper towel) across the skillet, dislodging it
  from the point at which it is beginning to burn.
  
  When you are satisfied with your chapati, remove it and wrap in a
  clean towel.  Continue to cook the other breads, stacking each as it
  is finished on top of the others.
  
  Making chapatis can be a very relaxing thing to do.  In quite a short
  time you can produce eight or ten breads, each one turning out a
  little bit different from the others, but all of them attractive,
  nutritious, and good.  We've grown so accustomed to making chapatis
  that they now feel almost like a convenience food, a household staple
  of the best kind.
  
  Yield: 8 chapatis, 7 to 8 inches across, thin and supple.

      Title: Fresh Coriander, Ginger, and Chile Breads
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  Semolina flour
      1 c  Plain yogurt
      1    Fresh red chile (seeds and
           Veins discarded), finely
           Chopped (or 1
           Jalapeno)
      1 tb Finely chopped ginger
      1 tb Curry leaves (if using dried
           Rehydrate by soaking before
           Using)
      2 tb Coriander leaves, roughly
           Chopped
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Warm water
           Oil for griddle surface
 
  You will need a medium-sized mixing bowl, a large castiron or other
  heavy griddle, a paper towel, a flat wooden spoon or rubber spatula,
  and a metal spatula.
  
  In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the semolina, yogurt, chile,
  gingerroot, curry leaves, coriander leaves, and salt.  Add the water a
  little at a time, stirring while you pour.  When all the water has
  been added and the batter is smooth, cover the bowl and let the
  batter rest for approximately one hour.
  
  To cook the breads, heat a large castiron griddle over medium high
  heat. Lightly oil the surface of the griddle using a paper towel, and
  reserve the towel for use between each dosa.  When the griddle is
  hot, pour on one-half cup of the batter.  As you pour, move in a
  circle out from the middle, trying to distribute the batter in as
  large a circle as possible. Immediately after, use the flat back side
  of a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to move the batter to cover the
  gaps, trying again to increase the diameter of the dosa.  Try to make
  a circle 9 to 10 inches in diameter.
  
  Over a medium high heat, the dosa will cook on its first side for one
  minute and a half.  After it has been cooking for one minute, begin to
  loosen it from the griddle with a sharp-edged spatula. Coax the dosa,
  don't force it, as it will come off easily from the griddle when it
  is ready. When ready, flip to the other side.
  
  The second side will cook in one and a half to two minutes, depending
  on the thickness of the
  
  dosa and the heat of the griddle.  You can check the dosa by simply
  lifting a corner with your spatula.  It should have nicely browned
  spots, but not nearly as uniformly brown as the first side.  When
  ready, remove to a plate.  Before starting the second dosa, rub the
  surface of the griddle with the oily paper towel, or if it's
  particularly dry, add a little more oil.  Continue cooking until all
  the dosas have been made (they can be stacked one on top of the other
  when they finish cooking), or serve immediately as they are made,
  flapjack-style.
  
  These delicious crepe-like breads are called rava dosa in India. They
  are made from semolina flour and spiked with chiles, ginger, curry and
  coriander leaves.
  
  Yield: eight dosas, each 9 to 10 inches in diameter.

      Title: Lentils with Garlic, Onion, and Tomato
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Mung dal (split mung beans,
           Yellow in color) or 2 1/2
        c  Cooked
           Mung dal
      4 c  Water
    1/2 ts Turmeric
      1    Bay leaf
      1    Inch cinamon stick
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      2    3 cloves garlic, finely
           Chopped
      1    Medium-sized onion, finely
           Chopped
      2    Medium-sized tomatoes,
           Chopped
 
  You will need a medium-sized saucepan, and a large deep skillet or
  saucepan.
  
  To cook split mung beans, rinse off with cold water and then place in
  a saucepan with four cups of water, turmeric, bay leaf, and cinnamon.
  Bring to a boil, then simmer until tender, approximately 20 to 25
  minutes. Stir in salt.  Serve hot, with a stack of chapatis.
  
  To make Dal Fry:
  
  In another large skillet or saucepan, heat the oil over high heat.
  Toss in the garlic and onion and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the chopped
  tomatoes and cook for one minute longer, stirring the entire time.
  Now pour in the cooked mung dal and stir (watch out for spattering as
  the dal first hits the oil).  Cook the dal for 2 to 3 minutes, or if
  the dal was cold or at room temperature, cook until hot. Serve
  immediately in individual bowls or in one large bowl.
  
  This easy dish is very quick to make and a welcome accompaniment for
  flatbreads.  Dal (split mung beans) is quickly cooked with a little
  turmeric, cinnamon, and bay leaf to make a satisfying soupy stew. It
  can also be served as a dal fry, fried with a little garlic, onion,
  and tomato. Either way, it should come to the table piping hot, an
  ideal companion for fresh chapatis.
  
  Yield: approximately 3 cups

      Title: Pita Bread
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 ts Dry yeast
  2 1/2 c  Warm water (approximately
    105    Degrees F)
      2 c  Whole wheat flour
           About 4 cups unbleached
           All-purpose or bread flour
      1 tb Salt
      1    To 2 tablespoons olive oil
 
  You will need a large bread bowl, a rolling pin, and unglazed quarry
  tiles or several baking sheets, or alternatively a castiron or other
  heavy skillet or griddle at least 9 inches in diameter.
  
  Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in a large bread bowl.  Stir to
  dissolve.  Add whole wheat flour, one cup at a time, then 1 cup white
  flour.  Stir 100 times (one minute) in the same direction to activate
  the gluten in the flour.  Let this sponge rest for at least 10
  minutes or as long as 2 hours.
  
  Sprinkle salt over the sponge and stir in the olive oil.  Mix well.
  Add 2 cups white flour, one cup at a time.  When the dough is too
  stiff to stir, turn it out onto a lightly floured bread board and
  knead for 8 to 10 minutes, until dough is smooth and elastic. Return
  the dough to a lightly oiled bread bowl and cover with plastic wrap.
  Let rise until at least double in size, approximately 1 1/2 hours.
  Gently punch down. Dough can be made ahead to this point and then
  stored, covered, in the refrigerator for 5 days or less.
  
  If at this time you want to save the dough in the refrigerator for
  baking later, simply wrap it in a plastic bag that is at least three
  times the size of the dough, pull the bag together, and secure it
  just at the opening of the bag.  This will give the dough a chance to
  expand when it is in the refrigerator (which it will do).  From day
  to day, simply cut off the amount of dough you need and keep the rest
  in the refrigerator, for up to one week.  The dough will smell
  slightly fermented after a few days, but this simply improves the
  taste of the bread. Dough should be brought to room temperature
  before baking.
  
  This amount of dough will make approximately 16 pitas if rolled out
  into circles approximately 8 to 9 inches in diameter and less than
  1/4-inch thick.  You can also of course make smaller breads.  Size
  and shape all depend on you, but for breads of this dimension the
  following baking tips apply:
  
  Place unglazed quarry tiles, or a large baking stone or two baking
  sheets, on a rack in the bottom third of your oven, leaving a one
  inch gap all around to allow air to circulate.  Preheat oven to 450
  degrees. Divide dough in half, then set half aside, covered, while
  you work with the rest. Divide dough into eight equal pieces and
  flatten each piece with lightly floured hands.  Roll out each piece
  to a circle 8 to 9 inches in diameter. You may wish to roll out all
  eight before starting to bake. Cover rolled out breads, but do not
  stack.
  
  Bake 2 at a time (or more if your oven is larger) directly on quarry
  tiles or baking sheets.  Bake each bread for 3 or 4 minutes, until
  the bread has gone into a full "balloon" or until it is starting to
  turn lightly golden, whichever happens first.  If there are seams or
  dry bits of dough - or for a variety of other reasons - your bread
  may not go into a full "balloon". Don't worry, it will still taste
  great. The more you bake pitas the more you will become familiar with
  all the little tricks and pitfalls, and your breads will more
  consistently "balloon." But even then, if you're like us, it won't
  always "balloon" fully and you won't mind because the taste will
  still be wonderful.  When baked, remove, place on a rack for about
  five minutes to let cool slightly, then wrap breads in a large
  kitchen towel (this will keep the breads soft).  When first half of
  the dough has been rolled out and baked, repeat for rest of dough, or
  store in refrigerator for later use, as described above.  You can
  also divide the dough into more, smaller pieces if you wish, to give
  you smaller breads.
  
  Yield :  16 pitas about 8 inches in diameter, or more smaller breads.

      Title: Bulgur Breads
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Fine or medium bulgur
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Boiling water
    1/2 c  Minced onion
           Approximately 2 cups
           Unbleached hard white or
           All-purpose flour
 
  You will need a medium-sized bowl, a food processor (optional),
  unglazed quarry tiles to fit on the bottom rack of your oven, and a
  rolling pin.
  
  Place the bulgur and salt in a food processor, pour the boiling water
  over, and stir or process briefly to mix.  Let stand for thirty
  minutes. When you come back to the bulgur mixture, it will look like
  the bulgur has totally absorbed the water.  However, proceed by
  adding 1 cup flour and the minced onion, and process for 1 minute.
  The dough should come together into a large ball as you process. If
  it doesn=t, feel the dough: If it feels dry and floury, start the
  processor, add 2 tablespoons warm water and process for 30 seconds;
  again if the bulgur and flour still dont come together, add another 2
  tablespoons water and process.  Once a ball of dough forms, process
  for 2 to 3 minutes longer, then turn out onto a well-floured surface.
  (If your processor is too small to handle the whole dough, work with
  half at a time, adding 1/2 cup flour to each portion, then combine
  when you turn out of the processor and knead by hand). Knead by hand
  for 4 to 5 minutes.
  
  Alternatively, if you do not have a food processor, combine bulgur,
  salt and boiling water in a medium-sized bowl and let stand for 30
  minutes. Add onions and 1/2 cup flour and stir in.  Add another 1/2
  cup flour and use your hands to fold flour into the dough.  With a
  little persistence, you will soon have a dough (although somewhat
  sticky) that you can knead. Turn out onto a well-floured kneading
  surface and knead for 6 or 7 minutes. Dough will be sticky at first,
  but will soon come together into a smooth workable dough; you may be
  surprised to discover how kneadable bulgur is.
  
  When finished kneading, cover the dough with plastic wrap and let
  stand until you are ready to proceed further, for 15 minutes to an
  hour, whatever is convenient.
  
  To bake, have your oven preheated to 450 degrees with baking stone or
  quarry tiles in place on a rack in the bottom third of the oven.
  Divide the dough into 8 pieces, and flatten each on a well-floured
  bread board. With a rolling pin, roll out one or two breads until
  very thin, about 8 to 10 inches in diameter.  Work with only one or
  two at a time, as many as will fit in your oven.  When ready, handle
  the bread gently as you place it on the hot tiles.  (You can also try
  dusting a peel or the back of a baking sheet with flour and using
  peel or sheet to transfer breads to hot tiles.) Bake on one side for
  1 1/2 to 2 minutes then turn over to the other side for 1 to 1 1/2
  minutes. The bread should begin to brown around the outside. When
  baked, keep breads warm by stacking them one on top of the other and
  wrapping them in a clean kitchen towel.  Serve warm.
  
  The dough for this cracker-like unyeasted flatbread is easily mixed
  in the food processor. The breads have a wonderful aroma as they bake
  and a satisfying savory taste, for the dough is made of full-grain
  bulgur, with only a little flour, and flavored with minced onion. The
  breads bake quickly in the oven. Bulgur breads go wonderfully with
  cheese, or strong flavors. Leave them to dry out and use as crackers,
  or wrap in a cloth to keep chewy and supple.

      Title: Olive Ladder Bread (Fougasse)
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Lukewarm water
      1 ts Dry yeast
      6    To 7 cups unbleached all
           Purpose flour
      2 tb Olive oil plus extra for
           Oiling surfaces
      2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Pitted and chopped black
           Olives (Nyons or Kalamata)
    1/4 c  Buckwheat flour
 
  You will need a large bread bowl, four 10 by 15-inch or larger baking
  sheets that will fit in pairs side-by-side in your oven, a sharp
  knife or razor blade, and a pastry brush.
  
  Place water in a large bowl, sprinkle on yeast, then stir in 2 1/2
  cups of the all purpose flour. Stir 100 times in the same direction
  (one minute) to develop the gluten, then leave this sponge covered
  with plastic wrap for 30 minutes or up to two hours.Stir in olive
  oil, salt, olives, and buckwheat flour. Mix in remaining flour, a cup
  at a time, stirring always in the same
  
  direction, until dough becomes too stiff to stir. Turn dough out onto
  a well floured working surface. Using floured hands, knead gently
  until the dough has an even consistency (apart from the olives), then
  knead 5 minutes longer. Clean bread bowl, oil it lightly, place dough
  in the bowl, then cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for 2 to 3 hours.
  It will have almost doubled in volume.
  
  Oil two 10 by 15-inch (or larger) baking sheets. Flatten dough down
  gently with your hands, then turn out onto floured working surface.
  Cut dough in half, return half to the bread bowl and cover. Divide
  remaining half in two. Knead each half into a ball and then flatten
  gently with the palm of your hand. Let stand five minutes to rest.
  Working with each piece in turn, flatten out with your palms into a
  rectangle or oval about 10-inches long and 5 to 6-inches wide. It
  will be about 1/2 to 3/4-inch thick. Transfer each to a lightly oiled
  baking sheet at least 14-inches long. Let loaves rise for 20 to 30
  minutes, covered with a damp towel or plastic wrap. Preheat oven to
  400 degrees and set rack at the center of the oven or just above. (If
  your baking sheets do not fit side-by-side on one rack, place two
  racks in oven, one just above the center and one just below. One
  bread can go on each rack; about halfway through baking (after 10 to
  12 minutes), switch the two around.) Just before placing in the oven,
  use a sharp knife or razor blade to make cuts through the breads:
  Starting two inches from the top and about an inch from the side, cut
  across the bread to within an inch of the other side. Make two more
  cuts, parallel to the first, at about 2-inch intervals (the cuts
  should go all the way through the dough). The dough will separate at
  each cut, so that the bread looks like a kind of fat-runged ladder;
  you can pull dough apart even more if you wish and if your baking
  sheets are long enough, by pulling gently on each end of the breads
  to make the slits gape more. Brush each loaf lightly with olive oil
  all over, place in the oven, and bake for 20 minutes. Breads will be
  golden when done.
  
  Once first two loaves are in the oven, oil two more baking sheets,
  then flatten remaining dough, divide into two, and repeat steps
  required to form loaves. Breads should almost have finished rising by
  the time the first batch comes out of the oven.

      Title: Pizza with Rosemary and Garlic
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Warm water
    1/2 ts Dry yeast
      4 c  Flour (approximately):
           Unbleached all-purpose or
           Hard white flour,
           Or a 50-50 blend of white
           And whole wheat
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Olive oil
           Topping:
      2 tb Olive oil (approximately)
      1 ts Fine sea salt
           Leaves from 3 sprigs
           Rosemary (approximately 2
           Tablespoons), optional
 
  You will need a large bread bowl, a baking sheet 12 by 18-inches or
  two smaller sheets.
  
  Place water in a large bowl.  Water should be warm but not hot to the
  touch.  Stir in the yeast and allow to dissolve.  Stir in 1 cup flour,
  stirring constantly in the same direction.  Stir in another cup
  flour, then stir 100 times in the same direction (one minute). This
  helps develop the gluten.  You now have a sponge.  Cover, and let
  stand for half an hour or up to three hours.  When you are ready to
  continue, sprinkle on salt and oil, then add more flour, stirring it
  in a half cup at a time. The dough will be getting heavier and harder
  to stir. When you can stir no longer, flour a kneading surface well
  and have more flour handy beside your work surface. Turn dough out
  and knead, adding extra flour to your work surface as necessary to
  prevent the dough from sticking. The dough will gradually become
  smooth and easy to work.  Knead for 10 minutes, clean bread bowl, oil
  it lightly, and place the ball of dough into the bowl to rise,
  covered with plastic wrap.  Let rise until more than doubled, almost
  three hours. When the volume of the dough has approximately doubled,
  you can proceed to the next step.
  
  Dough can be made ahead to this point and then stored.  If you wish
  postpone baking, gently push dough down, and leave covered in the
  bowl to rise again.  If delay will be more than several hours,
  instead store dough in a plastic bag in the refrigerator (for not
  more than five days). Bring out of the cold and take out of the
  plastic bag at least an hour before you want to work with it. Lightly
  flour your work surface and lightly oil a 12 by 18-inch baking sheet.
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Turn dough out onto work surface and
  flatten with the lightly floured palm of your hand. Pull and stretch
  the dough gently out into the rectangular shape you need to fit your
  baking sheet.  Take your time and give the dough time to rest if it
  is resisting stretching.  It will need to get quite thin. When you
  have stretched the dough to approximately the shape and size you
  need, transfer it to baking sheet and continue to gently press and
  stretch it to fit. Don't worry if it tears, just patch the hole with
  another piece of dough and press firmly to join the edges. If you
  have extra dough hanging over the edge, trim it off and use it to
  make another small pizza. Dough should be of an even thinness across
  the flat part of the baking sheet and should form a slight rounded
  rim as it meets the edge (which is for many people the best part of
  the pizza).  Brush top of pizza with oil, then dimple the surface all
  over with your fingers.  Sprinkle on sea salt and then optional
  rosemary leaves.  Place baking sheet on the bottom rack of the
  preheated oven and bake until the crust around the edge is slightly
  golden, 5 to 8 minutes, depending on how thin the pizza is. Remove
  from oven, brush crusts lightly with olive oil and also the center if
  you wish. Cut into large squares and serve warm or hot. We have often
  made pizza bionic several hours ahead, then wrapped it in a clean
  kitchen towel to keep it moist until we are ready to reheat it for
  serving. To reheat, place in a dampened paper bag in a 300'F oven for
  about 10 minutes.
  
  Yield: one large 12 by 18-inch pizza or two medium, or 3 or 4 small

      2 c  Dried navy beans
      2    Medium-sized tomatoes,
           Coarsely chopped
      2    Scallions, coarsely chopped
      2 tb Olive oil
      1    Stalk celery, coarsely
           Chopped
      3    To 4 large cloves garlic,
           Coarsely chopped
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1    To 2 branches basil (1/4 cup
           Loosely packed leaves)
  1 1/2 ts Salt
           Garnish and accompaniments:
           Freshly grated Parmesan or
           Aged goat cheese, freshly

  water and bring to a boil.  Skim off any foam, drain off water, and
  cover beans again with cold water to a depth of 3 to 4-inches. Put
  back on heat. As water heats, add tomatoes, scallions, oil, celery,
  garlic, black pepper, and basil.  Cover and bring to a boil. Lower
  heat and simmer covered for 2 to 3 hours, until beans are cooked and
  tender. Check beans every so often to ensure that they aren't running
  dry. Add more water if necessary. Once beans are cooked, add salt,
  and bring back to a rolling boil for 3 to 5 minutes to thicken.  Set
  aside until ready to serve, then reheat, and transfer to serving
  dish.  Serve hot, topped with a sprinkling of grated cheese and of
  freshly ground black pepper.  Put out pepper and extra cheese so
  guests can adjust flavorings as they wish.
  
  Yield: 4 to 5 cups thick soup. Serves 2 as a main course and 4 or 5

      Title: Snowshoe Naan
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Warm water
      1 ts Dry yeast
  1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
      4    To 5 cups unbleached hard
           White or all-purpose flour
      1 tb Salt
      1 ts Nigella (black onion seed)
 
  You will need a large bowl, and unglazed quarry tiles or a baking
  stone for the next-to-bottom rack of your oven.
  
  Place water in a large bread bowl, add yeast, and stir.  Add whole
  wheat flour and 1 cup white flour and stir well, then stir 100 times
  in the same direction to develop the gluten (one minute).  Let this
  sponge stand for
      1/2    hour to 3 hours, covered.
  
  Sprinkle salt over the sponge, then add another cup flour and stir.
  Continue adding flour and stirring until you can stir no longer. Turn
  dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead thoroughly, about
  ten minutes, until dough is smooth and easy to handle.
  
  Clean out bowl, oil lightly, and return dough to bowl.  Cover with
  plastic wrap and let rise in a convenient place for 2 to 3 hours.
  When the dough has more than doubled in volume, push down gently and
  turn out onto a lightly floured surface.  Divide the dough into eight
  equal pieces and shape each into a flat oval shape, approximately 4
  inches wide by 8 inches long.  Leave these flat disks out on the work
  surface and cover with plastic wrap to let rise for approximately 20
  minutes. Place quarry tiles or large baking stone on a rack in the
  lower third of your oven, leaving a 1 inch space between the tiles
  and the oven wall to allow air to circulate. Preheat oven to 450
  degrees F.
  
  Five minutes after the oven has preheated, begin shaping the first
  bread. Place a small bowl full of cold water by the edge of your work
  surface. Using your fingertips, first dip them in the water and then,
  beginning at one end of the disk of dough, make tightly spaced
  indentations all over the surface of the dough, so that it looks
  pitted, though not pierced through. Now stretch the dough gently into
  a long oval strip by draping it over both hands and pulling them
  apart gently. The dough should stretch and give, and after several
  tries will extend to make a long oval about 12 inches long with
  attractive stretch marks along it from the stretched indentations
  (hence, the name "snowshoe bread").
  
  Place the bread back on the work surface, sprinkle with a pinch (less
  than 1/8 teaspoon) of black onion seeds, then using both hands, place
  the bread directly on heated quarry tiles or stone. While the bread
  bakes, begin to shape the next bread.  Cooking time for each bread is
  approximately 4 minutes.  You will soon develop a rhythm so that you
  can bake two breads side by side across your oven, one going in when
  the other is half done. When done, breads will have golden patches on
  top and a crusty browned bottom surface. To keep breads warm and
  soft, wrap them in a cotton cloth five minutes after they come out of
  the oven.
  
  Serve warm or at room temperature.
  
  Yield: 8 rippled flatbreads about 12 inches long and 3 to 5 inches
  wide, with both soft and crispy textures.

      Title: Tajik Non
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 c  Warm water
      1 ts Sugar
      1 tb Dry yeast
      1 c  Plain yogurt (2 percent or
           Whole milk)
      1 c  Water
      1 tb Sea salt
      2 c  Whole wheat flour
  2 1/2    To 3 1/2 cups unbleached
           All-purpose or hard white
           Flour
           Topping:
           Approximately 2 tablespoons
           Finely chopped shallot
           Approximately 1 teaspoon
           Salt
           Water for spritzing
 
  You will need a large bread bowl, a small heavy-bottomed saucepan,
  unglazed quarry tiles or a baking stone or one or two baking sheets,
  to fit on a rack in your oven, a rolling pin, a bread stamp or a fork
  or a wire whisk, a peel or a long-handled spatula, small spray bottle
  for spritzing (optional).
  
  Place 1/2 cup warm water in a large bowl, stir in sugar, then
  sprinkle on yeast and stir to dissolve.  Place yogurt and one cup
  water in a saucepan, stir to mix, then place over medium heat,
  stirring occasionally, until lukewarm.  Add the yogurt mixture to the
  yeast and water mixture and stir. Add the whole wheat flour one cup
  at a time, stirring in one direction only as you add the flour. Then
  stir one hundred times (for about one minute) in the same
  
  direction to activate the gluten.  Let this sponge stand, covered,
  for 10 minutes or for as long as 2 hours.
  
  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon salt over the sponge, then stir in unbleached
  flour one cup at a time until dough is too stiff to stir.  Turn it
  out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 10 minutes, until
  the dough becomes smooth and elastic, incorporating more unbleached
  flour as necessary to prevent dough from sticking.
  
  Rinse out, wipe and lightly oil your bread bowl.  Add the dough,
  cover with plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled in volume,
  approximately 1 1/2 hours.
  
  Position a rack in the top third of your oven.  Arrange unglazed
  quarry tiles on it, leaving a 1-inch gap between tiles and the oven
  walls (to allow air to circulate).  Alternatively place a baking
  stone or baking sheets on the rack.  Preheat the oven to 500 degrees
  F.
  
  Gently punch down the dough and turn out onto a lightly floured
  surface. If you have time, let rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Place
  shallots and remaining salt beside your work surface, together with a
  bowl of lukewarm water.  Divide dough into 8 equal pieces. Using
  lightly floured hands, press each piece into a 3 to 4-inch round.
  
  Work with one round at a time, leaving the others covered at the back
  of your work surface.  Working on a lightly floured surface, roll out
  to a 6-inch round.  With a fork or bread stamp, or the edge of a wire
  whisk, stamp a 1 1/2-inch diameter circle at the center of the bread
  thoroughly, to flatten and pierce it (to prevent it from rising).
  Sprinkle onto the center approximately 1/2 teaspoon chopped shallot,
  a pinch of salt, and a sprinkle of water.
  
  Quickly roll out and prepare one, two, or three more breads
  (depending on the size of your oven), then transfer prepared breads
  to the hot tiles, stone, or baking sheets.  Begin shaping your next
  breads as the first batch is baking.  Let bake for approximately 5
  minutes, or until lightly golden; you can also let breads brown to a
  deeper hue by leaving them in for 7 to 8 minutes.
  
  Use a long-handled spatula to remove from the oven.  Place on a rack
  to cool, then stack and wrap loosely in a cotton cloth to keep soft
  and warm. Shape and bake remaining breads in the same way.
  
  Yield:  8 breads about 6 inches in diameter, with a soft raised rim
  and flattened center topped with shallots

      Title: Making Fresh Mozzarella Cheese
 Categories: Emeril
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 ga Water
           Salt
      1 lb Fresh Mozzarella Curd
      1 c  Finely chopped basil
      1 c  Roasted garlic
 
  In a large stock pot, add the water.  Add enough salt to the water
  until it tastes like saltwater.  Bring the temperature of the water
  up to about 120 to 130 degrees, until the touch of the water is like
  hot bath water. Place a colander in the water.  Crumble the cheese
  curd into the water. Using a wooden spoon, stir the mixture until the
  curd starts to pull.
  
  Using your hands or a spoon, pull the cheese until it begins to hold
  shape. It's like pulling taffy.  Do not over pull the cheese because
  the end product will be rubbery.  If the cheese hardens to soon, dip
  it back in the water and repeat the pulling process. After the
  desired weight is achieved, dip the cheese in an ice bath. The cheese
  can either be stored in salted water or rolled in plastic wrap. If
  you want to flavor the cheese, add the flavorings during the pulling
  process. Rub your hands with the herbs and garlic and work them into
  the cheese.
  
  Yield: about 1 pound of cheese

  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a small sauce pan, heat the
  milk and 2 tablespoons butter together. Using an electric mixer
  fitted with a wire whip, combine the eggs and sugar together. Beat on
  medium-high speed for about 8 minutes, or until the mixture is pale
  yellow, thick and has tripled in volume. With the machine running
  slowly add the heated milk. In a mixing bowl sift the flour, baking
  powder, and salt together. Fold the flour mixture into the egg
  mixture and mix thoroughly so that there are no lumps and the mixture
  is smooth. Fold in the vanilla. Grease 2 each 9-inch round cake pans
  with 2 tablespoons of butter. Sprinkle each with a tablespoon of
  sugar. Pour the cake batter evenly into the pans and bake for about
  25 minutes, or until the cakes spring back when touched. Cool for
  about 2 minutes. Using a thin knife, loosen the edges of the cakes,
  then flip onto a wire rack. When the cakes have cooled completely,
  slice each cake in half. To assemble, place the bottom layer on a
  9-inch round cardboard and place it on a wire rack. Spread 1 1/2 cups
  of the pastry cream evenly on top of the layer. Top with the second
  layer of cake. Spread 1 1/2 cups of pastry cream on it. Repeat the
  same process with the third layer. Top with the fourth layer. If
  necessary, shave off any uneven pieces of cake with a serrated knife
  so that it is smooth and even on all sides. Frost the entire cake
  with the chocolate fondant. Place the cake in the refrigerator and
  chill completely. Slice the cake into 16 slices.

 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Granulated sugar
  1 1/2 c  Light corn syrup
     20 oz Good quality semisweet
           Chocolate, preferably French
           Or Belgian
           Cut into small pieces plus,
      8 oz Additional
           Chocolate
      2    Sticks (16 tablespoons)
           Unsalted butter
     10    Whole eggs
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
  
  In a heavy bottomed pot, combine the sugar and corn syrup and bring
  to a boil.  Reduce the heat to low and cook for 5 minutes.  Remove
  from the heat.  Melt the 20 ounces chopped chocolate in the top of a
  double boiler over simmering water.  Stir the chocolate occasionally
  as it melts. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter. Set
  aside to cool slightly. With an electric mixer, beat the eggs at high
  speed until frothy. Lower the speed to medium and carefully pour the
  hot syrup into the beaten eggs. Add the melted chocolate and butter
  mixture and blend to a smooth consistency. Butter a 10 inch to 12inch
  round cake pan lightly and pour in the chocolate mixture.  Set the
  cake pan into a larger pan (such as a roasting pan) and add hot water
  to rise halfway up the sides of the cake pan. Place in the preheated
  oven and bake about 45 to 50 minutes.
  
  Being very careful not to scald yourself or get water into the torte,
  remove the pans from the oven, and remove the cake pan from the water
  bath. Cool the torte completely to room temperature before unmolding.
  Run a sharp knife around the inner circumference of the pan. Place a
  plate over the pan, invert, and, if necessary, tap the bottom of the
  pan with the knife handle to encourage the torte to release.
  
  The torte should then be refrigerated for at least 3 hours before
  serving. While the torte is cooling, place the heavy cream in a thick
  bottomed pot and begin to heat gently.  Add the remaining 8 ounces of
  chocolate, stir together while the chocolate begins to melt in the
  hot cream. Being careful not to burn, boil or scorch the chocolate,
  when the chocolate has melted almost entirely, remove from the heat
  and allow to cool for several minutes before pouring over the torte
  for a glossy "finish". Place the unmolded torte on a baking rack with
  a cookie sheet underneath, and pour slightly cooled chocolate ganache
  directly onto the center of the torte in one motion so that it will
  flow out in one smooth sheet over the top and sides of the torte.
  You can gently help this along with the aid of a spatula but is
  important to use still warmed ganache.
  
  Allow to dry a few moments at room temperature.  Then place the torte,
  baking rack, and cookie sheet into the refrigerator to chill
  completely and set firm.  If you haven't overheated the chocolate or
  cream, this "ganache" will set and harden into a shiny "couverture"
  during the hour the torte is chilling in the refrigerator.

           Semisweet chocolate,
           Preferably Belgian
           Or French
    1/2 c  Heavy cream, warmed
      1    Stick (8 tablespoons)
           Softened unsalted butter,
           Cut into chunks
      2 tb Rum (optional)
      1 ts Vanilla
    3/4 c  Shredded unsweetened coconut
           Toasted
 
  Melt the 1 pound of chocolate slowly in a double boiler.  Cool
  slightly, then combine with the heavy cream.  Stir in the butter and
  rum and refrigerate until firm but still pliable, about 20 minutes.
  Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a large straight tip and pipe
  into teaspoon size mounds on a sheet of waxed paper, or, alternately,
  spoon out the teaspoon size mounds.  Refrigerate until firm. Working
  quickly to prevent melting, roll the chocolate into balls, then chill
  again until firm. In a food processor fitted with a metal blade,
  pulse the toasted coconut briefly to make it a finer to help it
  adhere better to the truffles. When firm, roll each truffle in the
  coconut, pressing firmly to make sure the coconut sticks.  At this
  point you can refrigerate the truffles for as much as a day, until
  you are ready to dip them.
  
  Melt the dipping chocolate in a double boiler over hot, not boiling
  water. Using a wire dipping spoon, or a regular teaspoon and your
  fingers, dip each truffle briefly into the melted chocolate.  Remove
  to a cake rack set over a cookie sheet until dry, and refrigerate
  until firm. You may scrape up any chocolate that has dripped to be
  returned to the dipping pot. The truffles will keep for several weeks
  if refrigerated in a covered container.

  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the water and spinach in a
  saucepan. Wilt the spinach, pressing down the spinach with the back
  of a spoon, about 45 seconds. Drain the spinach, squeezing out the
  spinach tightly and reserve the liquid. Pour the liquid into a mixing
  bowl with 4 tablespoons of the butter. The butter will melt and cool
  the liquid to 110 degrees F. Stir in the yeast and dissolve the
  yeast. Add the beaten egg, sugar, salt, and black pepper. Finely chop
  the spinach and add to the yeast mixture. Add the flour and mix well
  with a wooden spoon until the dough comes away from the sides of the
  bowl. Using your hands, form the dough into a ball. Lightly oil a
  bowl. Place the dough in the bowl and turn the dough once. Cover the
  dough with plastic wrap and place in a warm, draft-free place until
  the dough doubles in size, about 1 hour. Butter 6 over-sized muffin
  tins. Invert the dough onto a floured surface and punch it down with
  your fist. Fold each side in and tuck the ends into the center.
  Repeat. Put the dough, seam side down and divide the dough into 6 six
  equal portions. Using your hand, gently roll the dough into a ball.
  Place the rolls in the prepared pan. Sprinkle the rolls with kosher
  salt and cheese. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until
  in doubled in size, about 1 hour. Bake the rolls for about 30
  minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and place on a
  wire rack to cool before removing from the pan.

  Stir together 1/4 cup lardo, prosciutto, rosemary, garlic and black
  pepper in a mixing bowl until smooth and set aside.
  
  To cook borlenghe, heat a 14 to 16-inch non-stick pan over medium

  batter to coat pan (just like a crespella) and return to heat. Cook 4
  minutes on the first side and turn carefully. (The texture will not

  using a gentle sawing motion. With a paring knife cut the custard
  into two 3 1/2 x 11-inch strips and cut each strip in half crosswise.
  With a long, wide offset spatula transfer a piece of custard onto a
  strip of pastry, covering half of it. Transfer a second piece of
  custard to fill the first layer. Top with a second strip of pastry,
  smooth side up, and repeat process. If necessary, smooth the sides of
  the napoleon with a knife so that they are stacked neatly.
  
  Using a serrated knife carefully slice the napoleon into individual
  serving pieces. Sift confectioner's sugar over the napoleon to form a
  thick coating. Heat skewers on stovetop burner until red-hot and
  brand the sugar with cross hatch marks.

           White pepper
      8    Sea scallops
           Essence
      4 ts Dijon mustard
           Long chives
 
  In a nonreactive saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. When
  the oil is hot, add the onions peppers, celery, jalapenos, garlic,
  thyme, and oregano. Season with salt and cayenne. Saute for 2
  minutes. Add the tomatoes, bay leaves and stock. Bring the liquid up
  to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Cook the sauce for 20 minutes.
  Remove the sauce from the heat. Using a hand-held blender, puree the
  sauce until smooth. Add the heavy cream and puree until incorporated.
  Reseason the sauce if needed. Using the Suzy Wong Threader, thread
  the potatoes through the machine, forming long curls of the potato.
  Season the potatoes with salt and pepper. Season the scallops with
  Essence. Rub each scallop with 1/2 teaspoon of the Dijon mustard.
  Fold four linen cloths in half. Divide the threaded potatoes between
  the four cloths. Divide the individual piles of potatoes in half. So
  you should have eight piles of threaded potatoes divided between four
  linen cloths. Place the scallops in the center of the potato piles.
  Wrap each scallop with the potatoes, covering the scallops
  completely. Tightly wrap the potato wrapped scallops up in the linen
  cloth. This will help the potatoes from discoloring too much. In a
  large saute pan, heat the remaining olive oil. When the oil is hot,
  pan-fry the potatoes for 3 minutes on each side or until the potatoes
  are golden brown. Remove the potatoes from the pan and drain on a
  paper-lined plate. Season with salt and pepper. To assemble, spoon a
  small pool of the sauce in the center each plate. Lay two potato
  crusted scallops in the center of the sauce. Garnish with long chives.

      2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Salt
      2 lg Eggs, beaten lightly
      1 tb Olive oil
 
  In a food processor combine the flour, salt, eggs, oil and 4
  tablespoons water and process until the mixture begins to form a
  ball, adding more water, 1 teaspoon at a time, if the dough is too
  dry. Process 30 seconds more to knead it.  Remove the dough from the
  processor and let it rest, covered with an inverted bowl, at room
  temperature for 1 hour.
  
  Set the smooth rollers of a pasta machine at the highest number. (The
  rollers will be wide apart.)  Divide the dough into 4 pieces, flatten
  1 piece into a rectangle, and cover the remaining pieces with an
  inverted bowl.  Dust the rectangle with flour and feed it through the
  rollers. Fold the rectangle in half and feed it through the rollers 6
  to 8 more times, folding in half each time and dusting with flour if
  necessary to keep it from sticking.  Turn the dial down one notch and
  feed the dough through the rollers without folding. Continue to feed
  the dough through the rollers without folding, turning the dial lower
  one notch each time, until the lowest notch is reached.  Roll the
  remaining pieces of pasta dough in the same manner.
  
  Use the blades of a pasta machine that will cut 1/4-inch wide strips.
  Feed one end of a sheet of pasta dough through the blades, holding
  the other end straight up from the machine.  Catch the strips from
  underneath the machine before the sheet goes completely through the
  rollers and put the cut strips lightly across floured jelly-roll pans
  or let them hang over the top of straight-backed chairs or on
  hangars. Let the pasta dry for 5 minutes, before cooking.

 Categories: Toohot
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Ancho chiles, lightly
           Toasted, stemmed, and seeded
      1 tb Cumin seeds
      2 ts Dried oregano, crumbled
      2 ts Dried thyme, crumbled
           I tablespoon salt
      4    Cloves garlic
    1/4 c  Mild white vinegar
      6    Thick shoulder pork chops
           1 small piece porkfat or up
           To 1 tablespoon lard
           Apple Tamarind Sauce (recipe
           Follows)
           1 cup sour cream
           Jicama Pancakes (recipe
           Follows)
 
  Place the toasted anchos in a bowl and cover them with warm water.
  Soak for about 20 minutes, then transfer with a slotted spoon to a
  blender. Add the cumin seeds, oregano, thyme, salt, garlic, and
  vinegar. Blend to a fairly smooth paste, but do not overblend.
  
  Pound the pork chops with a wooden mallet until flat. Spread a layer
  of the chili paste on both sides of the chops, place them in a large
  shallow baking dish and refrigerate overnight or for 24 hours,
  covered.
  
  In a large skillet, preferably cast-iron, heat the pork fat until it
  renders, or heat a teaspoon of the lard over medium-low heat. Cook the
  chops very slowly, for about 20 minutes, turning over once. Add more
  fat during the cooking time if the pan gets very dry and the chile
  paste is in danger of scorching. When the chops are done through
  (press them to see if the flesh springs back), raise the heat to
  medium-high and quickly brown them on both sides.
  
  Serve the chops immediately, garnished with Apple-Tamarind Sauce, sour
  cream, and pancakes.

      Title: Roast Suckling Pig
 Categories: Toohot
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     10    15 pound dressed, oven ready
           Suckling pig (see Note)
  1 1/2 c  Orange juice
    3/4 c  Fresh lime juice
    3/4 c  Fresh grapefruit juice
      2 tb Coarse sea salt
      1 tb Freshly ground black pepper
      1    Grapefruit, quartered
      2    Oranges, halved
      2    Limes, halved
      1 lg Onion, quartered
      1    Head garlic, halved
      1    Bay leaf
      3    To 4 sprigs fresh thyme
      1 bn Watercress, tough stems
           Removed, for garnish
      1 bn Curlyleafed parsley, tough
           Stems removed, for garnish
      4    Blood oranges, peel and pith
           Removed with a sharp knife
           Lemon, lime, or apple for
           The mouth
 
  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. In a bowl, combine the orange, lime,
  and grapefruit juice and whisk together. Wash and pat the pig dry
  with paper towels. Sprinkle inside and out with the salt and pepper
  and place it in a large roasting pan, belly side up. Place the
  grapefruit, oranges, limes, onion, garlic, bay leaf, and thyme inside
  the cavity and skewer it closed. Turn belly side down and place a
  ball of wood or a rolled up piece of aluminum foil about the size of
  a lemon in the pigs mouth. Skewer the legs into position by pulling
  the forelegs forward and bending the hind legs into a crouching
  position (this will help a large pig fit in a home oven, if it fits
  already, this is not necessary). Cover the tail and ears with small
  pieces of foil to prevent them from burning. Place the pig in the
  oven and baste with the citrus juice mixture. After the pig has
  roasted for 15 minutes, baste it again with the citrus juice mixture
  and reduce the heat to 325 degrees. Roast for 20 minutes per pound
  longer, basting generously every 15 or 20 minutes with the juice
  mixture and then the pan juices. To test for doneness, prick the
  thigh with the tip of a sharp knife to see if the juices run clear.
  The internal temperature should read 165 degrees on a meat
  thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the leg. Remove from
  the oven and allow to rest for 10 minutes, loosely tented with a
  large piece of aluminum foil. Distribute the parsley and watercress
  sprigs loosely around the edges of a large warmed oval platter. Halve
  the trimmed blood oranges and place them around the edges of the
  platter, nestled in the greens. Remove the foil from the tail and
  ears and replace the wood or foil from the mouth with a lemon, lime,
  or apple. Carve at the table, with confidence.
  
  Yield: 10 to 12 servings
  
  Note: Most good butchers will be able to obtain a small suckling pig,
  given 1 or 2 weeks notice. Ask them to dress the pig and remove the
  eyeballs and lower lids.

      1 tb Minced garlic
      2 tb Fresh lemon juice
      1 tb Chopped parsley
      1 tb Capers
      2 tb Chopped green onions
      1 c  Olive oil
    1/4 ts Cayenne
      1 tb Creole or whole-grain
           Mustard
      1 ts Salt
      4    Hot dog like rolls (about 6
           To 8 inches long)
      1 c  Shredded lettuce
      2    Pieces of parchment paper,
           Cut in half
 
  Preheat the vegetable oil for frying in either a deep sauce pan or a
  large skillet. Season the clams with Essence. Cover the clams with
  the milk and refrigerate for 1 hour. Remove the clams from the
  refrigerator and drain completely. In a shallow bowl, combine the
  cornmeal and flour.
  
  Season the flours with Essence. Dredge the clams in the seasoned
  flour, coating each clam completely. Place the clams in a wire basket
  and shake the clams, removing any excess flour. Fry the clams in the
  hot oil until crispy and golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. For the
  Tarter Sauce: put the egg, garlic, lemon juice, parsley, capers and
  green onions in a food processor and puree for 15 seconds. With the
  processor running, pour the oil through the feed tube in a steady
  stream. Add the cayenne, mustard, and salt and pulse once or twice to
  blend. Cover and let sit for 1 hour in the refrigerator before using.
  Best if used within 24 hours. Remove the clams from the oil and drain
  on a paper-lined plate. Season the clams with salt and pepper. To
  assemble, spread the tarter sauce on both sides of each roll. Arrange
  one dozen of the clams on one side of each roll. Top the clams with
  the shredded lettuce. Roll the clam roll up in parchment paper and
  slice in half. Serve the rolls with french fries, vinegar, and fresh
  lemon juice.

      Title: Grilled Hen
 Categories: Emeril
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    (1 1/2 pound) Cornish hen
      2 tb Honey
    1/4 ts Ground allspice
           Juice and zest of 2 oranges
      2 tb Olive oil
           Salt and pepper
 
  Debone hens, beginning at top of bird along either side of breast
  bone. Using a sharp knife, work your way down each side of carcass
  trying to remove as much meat from bone as possible, to make 2
  halves. Leave in leg and wing bones, but discard carcass (or save for
  stock). In a shallow nonreactive container large enough to hold both
  halves of hen combine honey, allspice, orange juice and zest, olive
  oil, and salt and pepper. Add cornish hen halves, turning to coat;
  meat should be completely covered with marinade. Refrigerate for 2
  hours, turning once. Preheat grill for 30 minutes. When it is
  medium-hot, place cornish hen halves on grill, skin side down, for 8
  minutes. Watch carefully -- it can burn easily because of honey in
  marinade. When first side is browned, turn and move halves to a
  cooler section of grill. Finish cooking about 12 minutes more, or
  until meat is no longer pink when you make a small slit down to the
  bone. Serve with sweet potatoes (recipe follows).

    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
           Shortening or vegetable oil
           For frying
     23    Limes
 
  Cut the chicken into serving pieces. The breast pieces should be cut
  in half. Place the chicken in a bowl and cover with the buttermilk
  overnight.
  
  In a mediumsize bowl, combine the flour, paprika, cumin, cayenne,
  salt, and pepper.
  
  Heat enough oil to a depth of about 3/4-inch in a large heavy
  skillet. When the oil is mediumhot dip the chicken pieces in the
  flour mixture and fry, without crowding the chicken. If necessary,
  use 2 skillets or fry in batches.
  
  Reduce the heat to medium and fry until the coating becomes a deep
  golden brown, turning the chicken as needed. The white meat should be
  done in 20 to 25 minutes, dark meat in about 35 minutes. Juices
  should run clear when the chicken is pricked with a fork. Squeeze
  lime juice over the chicken 10 minutes before it is done. Drain
  chicken on paper towels.

 Categories: Emeril
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 oz Finely chopped pancetta
      1 c  Chopped onions
    1/2 c  Chopped celery
    1/4 c  Minced carrot
      2 tb Minced shallots
      1 tb Minced garlic
      4 oz Ground veal round
      4 oz Ground pork sausage
      8 oz Ground beef chuck
    2/3 c  Dry red wine
  1 1/2 c  Meat stock
      2 c  Milk
      1 c  Peeled, seed and crushed
           Plum tomatoes
           Salt and pepper
    1/2    Polenta recipe (same as
           Above)
 
  Preheat the oven 375 degrees.  In a saute pan, heat the olive oil.
  When the pan is smoking hot, saute the celery, onions, carrots,
  shallots and garlic. Saute the vegetables for 1-2 minutes or until
  the vegetables are wilted. Add the ground meats and saute until the
  meat is brown, about 4-5 minutes. Strain the fat off the meat. Turn
  the meat into a saucepan. Deglaze the pan with the red wine. Add the
  stock and milk. Season with salt and pepper. Bring up to a boil and
  reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 1 hour and add the crushed red
  tomatoes. Continue simmering for 45 minutes or until the mixture
  resembles a thick, meaty stew.  Grease a 3 quart baking dish. Slice
  the polenta into 1 inch slices.  Spoon a small amount of the ragu
  over the bottom of the dish.  Arrange the polenta over the ragu. Top
  the polenta with the ragu and sprinkle with the
  
  cheese.  Repeat the procedure until all the polenta is used.  Spread
  any remaining ragu on top and sprinkle with remaining cheese.  Bake
  for 1 hour covered and the last 5 minutes uncovered.  Spoon the
  mixture into a shallow bowl.  Garnish with cheese and green onions.

      4    Eggs
    1/2 c  Warm milk with 2 tablespoons
           Butter melted in
 
  To make pasta:
  
  Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting
  board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and
  milk mixture. Using a fork, beat together the eggs and milk mixture
  and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the
  well.
  
  As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well
  shape. Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.  The dough
  will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.
  
  Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your
  hands. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board
  and scrape up any leftover crusty bits.  Discard these bits. Lightly
  flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough
  should be elastic and a little sticky.  Continue to knead for another
  3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the
  dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.
  
  Note:  Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe.
  They are essential for a light pasta.
  
  To make bigoli:
  
  Knead dough until smooth and tight and let rest 20 minutes.  Cut
  dough into 6 and run through a meat grinder set to smallest extrusion
  size. As pasta exits, cut it into 12-inch pieces and immediately dust
  with flour. Lay out on to cookie sheet dusted with cornmeal, being
  careful to keep the strands separate.  Finish all 6 pieces the same
  way.

      1 c  Grated extra-sharp Cheddar
           Cheese
      2 ts White vinegar mixed with 1/3
        c  Very cold water
           Apple Filling:
      6    To 7 large Delicious apples
           (3 pounds), peeled, cored
           And sliced thinly
           Into 1/16-inch thick slices
      2 tb Freshly-squeezed lemon juice
      1 c  Sugar, plus additional for
           Sprinkling
    1/3 c  Unbleached all-ppurpose
           Flour
    3/4 ts Cinnamon
    3/8 ts Salt
      2 tb Unsalted butter, softened
      1    Egg beaten with 1 tablespoon
           Cold water, for glaze
 
  Make dough: In workbowl of a food processor fitted with metal blade
  combine flours and salt. Cut butter and lard into small pieces, add
  to workbowl and process 5 seconds. Add cheese and pulse on-off 2
  times to mix. With motor running, pour in enough vinegar mixture in a
  slow steady stream for dough to form a ball; process 10 to 15
  seconds. Turn dough out onto work surface. If dough appears too dry,
  work in 1 to 2 more teaspoons water. Specks of butter and cheese will
  be visible in dough. Shape dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap
  and chill at least 2 hours or overnight before using.
  
  Make filling: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. As you slice apples,
  toss them gently with lemon juice. Whisk together sugar, flour,
  cinnamon and salt, add to apple slices and toss gently to coat evenly.
  
  Divide dough into 2 unequal pieces, making piece for top crust
  slightly larger. On a lightly-floured work surface roll smaller piece
  into an 11-inch round. Line pie plate with bottom crust and fill with
  apples. Using your hands shape them into a firmly-packed mound
  slightly higher in center than at sides; dot with butter. Trim edges
  of bottom crust to a 3-inch overhang. Roll out remaining dough to an
  11-inch round and arrange over filling. Trim edges of top crust to a
  :-inch overhang, fold top crust under edge of bottom crust and flute
  edges decoratively, pressing together with your thumb and forefinger.
  Cut 3 1 3/4-inch slashes in center of top crust.
  
  Bake pie 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F and
  continue to bake 30 to 40 minutes more, until pastry is golden brown
  and juices are bubbling. Ten minutes before end of baking, brush top
  with egg glaze and sprinkle with sugar. Cool on a wire rack before
  serving slightly warm or at room temperature.

  2 1/2 c  Stone-ground rye flour
      2 tb Coarse salt
      2 c  Dried currants

  In a large mixing bowl stir together starter and water.  Mix in half
  of white flour and half of rye flour, one cup at a time, and salt.
  Stir in currants, remaining rye flour and enough of white flour to
  make a stiff dough.  When dough is too stiff to stir, turn out onto
  work surface. Knead until it comes together in a mass, about 8
  minutes; dough will still be slightly sticky.  Transfer to a clean
  mixing bowl, cover and set aside until doubled in size.
  
  Turn out dough on lightly-floured work surface and punch down with
  floured hands.  Knead briefly and divide in two.  Roll each half into
  a log about 3 inches in diameter; cut each into 12 rolls. Using palm
  of your hand roll each piece of dough into a small, tight round roll.
  Place rolls, about 2 inches apart, on a cornmeal-dusted baking sheet.
  Cover and set aside to rise, until barely doubled. Preheat oven to

    1/4 ts Baking soda
    1/2 c  Lukewarm whole milk (90 to
    110    Degrees)
      2 tb Butter, melted
      1 ts Salt
  5 1/2 c  Flour
 
  Make starter:  In a glass bowl mix together all ingredients for
  starter. Cover with a plate and place in a barely warm oven for 12
  hours, or until top is covered with 1/2 to 1-inch of foam (a gas oven
  with pilot light is warm enough or heat electric oven to 250 degrees
  for 20 minutes; turn off before placing bowl in oven.)  Keep warm.
  
  Make bread:  Strain liquid from salt starter through a sieve set over
  a large mixing bowl.  Pour 1/2 cup warm water over potato, pressing to
  extract as much liquid as possible; discard potato. Stir baking soda,
  milk, butter and salt into potato liquid.  Add 2 cups of flour and
  beat until very smooth.  Add 2 1/2 cups more flour, stirring until
  dough comes together.  Sprinkle remaining flour over work surface,
  turn out dough and knead for 10 to 12 minutes, until dough is smooth.
  Divide in two and form into loaves. Place loaves in 2 well-buttered
  loaf pans, cover and set aside in a warm place to double, 4 to 5
  hours. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bake 35 to 45 minutes or until
  bottom of loaves sound hollow when tapped. Turn loaves out of pans
  and cool completely on racks before slicing.

      Title: Strawberry Creme Caramel Tart
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/4 c  Whole small strawberries
           (about 30), trimmed
  1 1/4 c  Granulated sugar
  1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
      1 lg Whole egg
      3 lg Egg yolks
      1 ts Vanilla
           Pastry crust:
      1 c  All-purpose flour
  2 1/2 tb Packed brown sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
      5 tb Unsalted butter, cut into
           Pieces and softened
           Slightly
  1 1/2    To 2 tablespoons ice water
           Garnish:
        sm Strawberries
 
  Make creme caramel:
  
  Preheat oven to 225 degrees F. Spread strawberries on a baking sheet
  and bake in middle of oven 30 minutes to dry slightly. Transfer
  baking sheet to a rack to cool strawberries.
  
  Increase temperature to 350 degrees F.
  
  In a dry heavy saucepan cook granulated sugar over moderately low
  heat, stirring slowly with a fork (to help sugar melt evenly), until
  melted and pale golden. Cook caramel, without stirring, swirling pan,
  until deep golden. Immediately pour caramel into a 9-inch glass pie
  plate, tilting plate to coat bottom and sides evenly. Put pie plate
  in a baking pan.
  
  In a saucepan heat cream just to a boil and remove pan from heat. In
  a bowl whisk together egg, yolks, vanilla, and a pinch of salt until
  combined well and in a stream add warm cream, whisking. Skim off any
  froth and carefully pour custard into pie plate. Arrange strawberries
  
  decoratively on their sides in custard (custard should completely
  cover strawberries) and add enough hot water to pan to reach halfway
  up side of plate. Bake creme caramel in middle of oven about 40
  minutes, or until custard is just set but still trembles slightly
  (custard will continue to set as it cools). Remove plate from pan and
  cool custard completely on a rack.
  
  Chill creme caramel, loosely covered with plastic wrap, at least 4
  hours and up to 1 day.
  
  Make crust:
  
  In a large bowl with fingertips or a pastry blender blend together
  flour, brown sugar, salt, and butter until mixture resembles coarse
  meal. Add 1 tablespoon ice water and toss mixture with a fork until
  incorporated. Add some or all of remaining ice water, 1/2 tablespoon
  at a time, tossing with fork to incorporate until mixture just begins
  to form a dough. On a work surface with heel of hand smear dough in 3
  or 4 forward motions to help distribute butter. Form dough into a
  ball and flatten to form a disk. Chill dough, wrapped in plastic
  wrap, 1 hour.
  
  On a lightly floured surface roll out dough into a 10-inch round
  (about 1/8 inch thick) and transfer to a baking sheet. Using a 9-inch
  plate as a guide, trim dough to a 9-inch round. Prick round all over
  with a fork and chill 30 minutes. Bake round in middle of oven until
  golden, about 30 minutes, and cool completely on baking sheet on a
  rack.
  
  Just before serving, assemble tart. Have ready a flat serving plate at
  least 10 inches in diameter with a slight lip. Run a thin knife
  around edge of creme caramel and rotate pie plate back and forth to
  make sure creme caramel is loosened. Slide crust on top of creme
  caramel and invert serving plate on top of crust. Invert tart onto
  serving plate (caramel will run to edges of plate) and garnish with
  strawberries.

      Title: Peach Pie with Almond Crumble Topping
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Sweet dough for 1 crust pie
           Topping:
      1 c  All-purpose bleached flour
      3 tb Sugar
    1/4 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
    1/2 c  Sliced almonds
      6 tb Unsalted butter, melted
           Filling:
      3 lb Firm, ripe, yellow fleshed
           Free stone peaches, about 8
           Or 9 medium
           Peaches
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 tb All-purpose bleached flour
    1/2 ts Almond extract
    1/8 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
      2 tb Cold unsalted butter
 
  To make topping: Combine flour, sugar and nutmeg in a mixing bowl;
  stir well to mix and stir in sliced almonds. Stir in butter evenly.
  Set aside for 5 minutes, then, using your fingertips, break the
  mixture into 1/4 to 1/2-inch crumbs. Set aside again while you
  prepare the filling.
  
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees and set racks at middle level. Roll out
  bottom crust and arrange in 9-inch Pyrex plate.
  
  To make filling: Peel the peaches by cutting a cross in the blossom
  end of each and dropping them three at a time into a pan of boiling
  water. Remove after 20 or 30 seconds with a slotted spoon or skimmer
  and drop them into a bowl of ice water. If the peaches are ripe, the
  skin will slip off easily. If it does not, remove the skin with a
  sharp stainless steel paring knife. (If you peel it with a knife,
  include an extra peach for what you have peeled away.) Hold each
  peeled peach gently in your left hand over a mixing bowl (if you are
  left handed reverse.) With a stainless steel paring knife make a cut
  through to the pit, from stem to blossom end. Make another cut about
  3/4-inch to the right of the first one along the outside of the
  peach. Angle the knife blade back so the cuts meet at the pit. Twist
  the knife blade upward slightly as a wedge of peach will fall into
  the bowl. Continue in the same manner around the peach, cutting it
  into 8 to 10 wedges. Discard the pit and repeat with remaining
  peaches. Add remaining ingredients, except the butter, to the peaches
  and stir gently with a rubber spatula to combine. Pour filling into
  the prepared pastry shell and smooth. Dot with the butter.
  
  Scatter the crumb topping evenly over the filling. Place pie on the
  bottom rack of the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Lower the
  temperature to 350 degrees and move pie to the middle rack. Bake
  another 30 minutes, or until the crust and crumble are a deep golden
  and the juices are just beginning to bubble up. Cool the pie on a
  rack and serve warm or room temperature.

      2 pt Blueberries, rinsed, drained
           And picked over
    3/4 c  Sugar
      3 tb Cornstarch
      3 tb Water
      1 ts Finely grated lemon zest
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Freshly ground nutmeg
      2 tb Unsalted butter
           Egg wash: 1 egg beaten well
           With a pinch of salt
      1 ts Sugar for finishing the top
           The pie, optional
 
  Filling: Combine 1 cup of the blueberries with the sugar in a
  non-reactive saucepan. Bring to a simmer over low heat, stirring
  occasionally, until the sugar is melted and the mixture is very
  
  liquid--about 5 minutes. Combine the cornstarch and water in a small
  bowl and whisk the blueberry and sugar mixture into it. Return
  everything to the pan and cook, stirring constantly over low heat
  until the mixture comes to a boil, thickens and becomes clear. If ii
  does not become clear, continue to cook over low heat for a few more
  minutes until it does. Pour into a large bowl and stir in the
  remaining filling ingredients, except the blueberries, then add the
  remaining 3 cups blueberries. Cool.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and set racks at upper and lower
  thirds of the oven. Roll out the bottom crust and arrange in 9 inch
  Pyrex pie pan. Pour the cooled filling into the bottom crust. Prepare
  a lattice top crust. Flute the edge of the pie and carefully brush it
  with egg wash. If you wish sprinkle the top of the pie with sugar.
  Place the pie in the oven on the lower rack and reduce temperature to
  375 degrees for about 40 minutes, until the crust is baked through
  and a deep golden brown and the filling is gently bubbling. If the
  top crust has not colored sufficiently after 30 minutes of baking,
  move the pie to the upper rack of the oven for the last 10 minutes.
  Cool the pie on a rack.

    1/2 ts Vanilla
      1 pn Salt
    3/4 c  Flour
      1 ts Powdered ginger
      4 tb (2 ounces) unsalted butter,
           Melted and cooled to room
           Temperature

MMMMM------------------------GINGER SYRUP-----------------------------
      1 c  Sugar
  1 1/4 c  Water
      1 oz Ginger root stem, peeled and
           Rough chopped

MMMMM------------------------GINGER CREAM-----------------------------
      1 c  Heavy cream
    1/4 c  Sugar
      2 tb Finely chopped candied
           Ginger
      8    Mint sprigs, for garnish
      8 sm Pieces of candied ginger,
           For garnish
 
  Preheat the oven to 350. Butter and flour a 9-inch cake pan. Combine
  the egg yolks and 3/4 cup of sugar in a mixing bowl, and whisk until
  thick and light in color. Stir in the vanilla. Beat the egg whites
  and salt with an electric mixer until they form soft peaks. Add the
  remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, and beat until glossy, 15 to 20
  seconds more. Incorporate 1/3 of the whites into the egg mixture.
  Combine the flour and the ginger, mix well. Then sift 1/4 cup of
  flour mixture over the egg mixture, and gently fold it in with a
  spatula. Repeat, folding in whites and flour mixture until the last
  of the batch of flour is nearly incorporated. Then fold in the melted
  butter. Pout the batter into the prepared pan, and bake just until
  the cake begins to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 30
  minutes. Cool 10 minutes in the pan and remove from the pan.
  
  Whip the sugar and cream until soft peaks form. Remove the cake from
  the pan, and place on a pretty plate. Using a pastry brush, moisten
  the cake with the ginger syrup. Fold the finely chopped ginger into
  the whipped cream, and ice the cake with the cream. Decorate with
  candied ginger and mint. Dust with powdered sugar.
  
  Ginger syrup: Combine all ingredients in a saucepan and simmer for 15
  minutes. Cool and use the syrup to moisten cakes, sweeten tea, or
  over your ice cream.

      Title: Sauteed Red Snapper with Basil Oil and Sundried Tomatoes
 Categories: 
      Yield: 4 servings
 
MMMMM------------------MICHAEL'S PLACE #ML1A05-----------------------
      4    Five ounce pieces of red
           Snapper fillet, skin on, but
           With all pin bones removed
      2 tb Olive oil
           Salt and ground black pepper
           To taste
      1    Garlic cloves, crushed
    1/4 c  Sundried tomatoes, soaked in
           Hot water, drained, and
           Julienne
      2 tb Chopped fresh thyme leaves
      2 tb Chopped fresh oregano
           Leaves
      3 tb Finely chopped shallots
      4 ts Basil flavored olive oil
 
  Season the snapper fillets with salt and pepper. Preheat a saute pan
  with the olive oil until the oil is hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the
  snapper to the hot pan, flesh side down, and cook over medium heat 4
  to 5 minutes. Turn to cook the skin side an additional 3 to 4
  minutes. The fillets will curl inwards briefly, but once they have
  cooked for a minute, they will begin to relax and lay flat again,
  allowing you to cook the skin side to a crispy texture.
  
  Lift out the snapper with a slotted spatula, leaving the juices and
  oil in the pan. Add the sundried tomatoes, garlic, and shallots, and
  saute together for 2 minutes. Add the fresh herbs to the pan. Stir
  quickly, just to heat the herbs enough to release their aromas. Pour
  the sundried tomato and herb mixture over the snapper. Then drizzle a
  teaspoon of basil oil over each fillet and around the dish.

MMMMM--------------------MOLTO MARIO #MB5727-------------------------

MMMMM---------------------------PASTRY--------------------------------
      2 c  Flour
      1    Egg
      2    Yolks
    1/2 c  Sugar
      3 tb Sweet butter and
      3 tb Olive oil melted together
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      2 c  Fresh ricotta (sheep's milk
           Is best)
    1/2 c  Pine nuts
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1    Lemons; Juice and zest of
      3    Eggs
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
  
  To make the pastry, make a well of the flour, place egg, yolks, sugar,
  butter and olive oil mixture in center and proceed as you would with
  fresh pasta, i.e. bring flour in bit by bit until liquid in well is
  thick enough to bring together with hands. Knead until dough is
  smooth and then allow to rest 10 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling
  by mixing together the ricotta, pine nuts, sugar, lemon zest, juice
  and eggs in a bowl until creamy. To assemble, roll out the pastry to
  form two 12 inch circles. Place one circle down to line the bottom
  and sides of the pan. Spread the ricotta mixture evenly over this
  layer. Place the remaining circle of dough over the top and pinch
  together the edges. Place in oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes.
  Remove and serve warm or at room temperature with vin santo from
  Cappezzana.

MMMMM----------------STRUDEL PASTRY BASIC RECIPE---------------------
      1    Stick butter plus 3 sticks
           (cold)
      1 ts Salt
  2 1/2 c  Flour plus 1 cup
    1/2 c  Ice water
 
  Strudel pastry: In a food processor, place 1 stick of butter, 1
  teaspoon salt, and 2 1/2 cups flour and blend until texture of
  breadcrumbs. Slowly add ice water until dough comes together. Remove
  and form into a ball, then flatten it into a 8 by 10-inch rectangle
  and place in refrigerator. This is called the pasta mixture.
  
  In a food processor, place 3 remaining sticks of butter and 1 cup
  flour until blended and scrape out on to a board. Working quickly,
  form this mixture in a 4-inch square and place in refrigerator. This
  is called the burro mixture.
  
  After 1/2 hour, when the two mixtures are similar in texture, place
  pasta mixture on a well-floured clean marble surface. Place burro
  mixture in center and fold the pasta mixture over it, like wrapping a
  gift. Flatten with a rolling pin and roll out to a 8 by 16-inch
  rectangle, flouring regularly. If butter comes to surface, flour the
  spot heavily and continue working. Fold bottom third up and top third
  down to form a small package and turn one quarter clockwise. Pat
  dough with rolling pin to adhere and roll out to large 8-inch by
  16-inch rectangle again. Repeat folding process and refrigerate 30
  minutes, covered in a moist cloth. Remove and repeat the
  rolling-and-folding process 3 times. Allow 30 minutes refrigeration
  between each maneuver. The dough is now ready and will keep in the
  refrigerator 10 days, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees and grease a cookie sheet.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, combine walnuts, hazelnuts, lemon zest, orange
  zest, candied citron, chocolate pieces, currants, soaking liquid and
  stir to combine. Add egg whites and 1/4 cup sugar and fold together.
  Roll pastry out to a 10 by 16-inch rectangle and position the longest
  side parallel to the work surface edge. Spoon the filling over the
  pastry evenly, leaving 2 inches uncovered at the north end. Roll the
  pastry up like a jelly roll from south to north so it appears to be a
  thick pipe. Make a circle of the pipe by attachi the two open ends
  like a wreath. Brush with beaten eggs yolks and sprinkle with
  remaining sugar. Place on cookie sheet and bake 50 minutes. Allow to
  cool before cutting. Serve with Verduzzo wine.

 Categories: Emeril
      Yield: 4 servings
 
 
  Brush cold grill with oil to prevent sticking.
  
  Use one-gallon zip-lock plastic bags to marinate up to 1 pound of
  meats or vegetables in 2 to 3 cups of marinade; seal, pressing out
  air, set bag in a large pan or baking dish and marinate,
  refrigerated, turning occasionally.
  
  Glass baking dishes work well for marinating too, but avoid aluminum,
  which will interact with acids in marinades, and soft plasic or
  rubber containers that pick up odors easily.
  
  Trim excess fat from meat to avoid flare-ups; slash fatty edges to
  keep meat from curling.
  
  Fill a plant mister with 7 parts water and 1 part vinegar; use to
  spray grill when flames flare up.
  
  Preheat gas grills at least 15 minutes; for charcoal grills, light at
  least 45 minutes before, and let burn to hot embers, coated with ash.
  
  To flavor your barbecue, add aromatic hardwoods, such as hickory,
  mesquite or oak chips or chunks or aromatic fruit woods, such as
  apple or cherry or vine cuttngs; soak wood in cold water for at least
  30 minutes, then add to hot coals.
  
  Begin grilling when grill temperature stabilizes at 300 Fahrenheit
  
  Use your hand to determine approximate temperature; hold your hand 3
  inches above the rack and count the seconds you can comfortably keep
  it in place: 5 seconds for low, 4 for medium, 3 for medium-high, 2
  for high.
  
  For kebabs:  grease flat, narrow metal skewers or soak bamboo skewers
  in water for 30 minutes.
  
  For small, delicate items such as fish, shrimp or asparagus use an
  oiled grill basket for easy turning.
  
  For long-cooking vegetables or fruits (such as potatoes, whole heads
  of garlic or apples) cut a large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil,
  oil well, fill with sliced vegetables or fruit and seasonings,
  drizzle with oil, seal and place on hot grill.
  
  Use long-handled tools and tongs -- not forks -- to turn meat to avoid
  piercing and releasing juices
  
  To prevent scorching, brush meat with prepared barbecue sauce only
  after it is cooked through
  
  Don't forget to use heavy-duty oven mitts, preferably asbestos

      Title: White Pan Bread
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  Warm tap water, about 110
           Degrees
  2 1/2 ts (1 envelope) active dry
           Yeast
      5    To 5 1/2 cups unbleached,
           All purpose flour
      1 tb Salt
      1 tb Sugar
      5 tb Unsalted butter, melted, or
           Vegetable oil
 
  Oil 2 (8 1/2 by 4 1/2 by 2 1/2-inch) loaf pans. Whisk yeast into warm
  water and set aside while preparing other ingredients.
  
  To mix dough by hand, place 5 cups flour, salt and sugar in a mixing
  bowl and stir in yeast mixture and melted butter. Continue to stir
  until mixture forms a rough dough. Turn dough out onto a lightly
  floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 5
  minutes. If dough is excessively soft and sticky, add remaining flour
  1 tablespoon at a time.
  
  To mix dough in a heavy duty mixer, place flour, salt and sugar in a
  mixer bowl, add yeast mixture and melted butter and mix on low speed
  with dough hook for about 5 minutes, or until dough is smooth and
  elastic. If dough is excessively soft and sticky, add remaining
  flour, 1 tablespoon at a time.
  
  To mix dough in food processor, place flour, salt and sugar in bowl
  fitted with a metal blade. Pulse several times to mix. Add yeast
  mixture and butter and pulse 8 to 10 times until dough forms a ball.
  If dough is excessively soft and sticky, add remaining flour 1
  tablespoon at a time, and pulse, until dough forms a coherent ball.
  Let dough rest for 5 minutes, then run the machine continuously for
  30 seconds.
  
  Place dough in oiled bowl and turn to oil all surfaces. Cover bowl
  with plastic wrap and allow dough to rise until double in bulk, about
  1 hour. Turn risen dough out onto a lightly floured work surface (you
  may need the help of a scraper). Deflate dough and divide into two
  equal pieces. To form loaf, make sure the surface is free of excess
  flour, then stretch dough into rectangle. Fold in short ends of dough
  until it is approximately the length of the pan, then fold the far
  long edge over to the middle. Fold over the other long side and
  compress to form a tight cylinder. Place the loaf in the pan, seam
  side down. Cover the pan with plastic wrap. Repeat with the second
  piece of dough. Allow to rise until doubled. When loaves are almost
  doubled, preheat oven to 400 degrees and set rack at middle level.
  When loaves are completely risen, place in oven and bake for 30
  minutes or until the loaves are golden brown and firm and the
  internal temperature is about 210 degrees. Unmold loaves to a rack to
  cool on their sides.

      1 c  Heavy cream
    1/2 c  Freshly-brewed strong
           Coffee
           Cognac or rum
 
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Butter and flour baking sheet. In a
  saucepan combine water, butter, cut into pieces and a pinch of salt
  and bring to a boil over high heat; butter should melt just as water
  boils. Reduce heat to medium and add flour all at once, beating with
  a wooden spoon until dough pulls away from sides of pan and forms a
  ball. Transfer dough to bowl of an electric mixer, begin beating on
  high speed and add 3 eggs, one at a time, beating well after each
  addition. Batter should be elastic and just stiff enough to hold soft
  peaks. If batter is still stiff, break fourth egg into a small bowl,
  whisk well and add just enough of the egg to the batter to thin to
  proper consistency. Transfer warm dough to a pastry bag fitted with a
  1/2-inch tip. Pipe 18 1 1/2-inch puffs at least 2 inches apart on
  prepared baking sheet. Brush with egg wash, gently smoothing tops of
  puffs. Bake in upper third of oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 400
  degrees F and bake for 15 to 20 minutes more, or until puffed and
  golden. Remove sheet, turn off oven and piece sides of each puff
  several times with the tip of a sharp knife. Return sheet to
  turned-off oven and let puffs stand 30 minutes, with oven door ajar,
  to dry. Transfer to racks to cool completely.
  
  Soften ice cream to scooping consistency. Line a baking sheet with
  waxed paper. Use a small ice cream scoop to scoop out 18 1 1/2-inch
  ice cream balls. Freeze until solid.
  
  In a double boiler or in a bowl set over a saucepan of barely
  simmering water, melt chocolates with cream and coffee, stirring
  occasionally, until smooth and warmed through. Add cognac or rum, to
  taste. Keep warm over warm water until ready to serve.
  
  To serve, slice puffs in half, fill bottom of each with an ice-cream
  ball and replace top. Arrange 3 on each plate and serve immediately.
  Pass a warm sauceboat of hot fudge sauce for each person to pour over
  their own dessert.

      Title: Fallen Chocolate Pecan Cake
 Categories: Baker
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/4 c  Pecans (1-ounce)
      3 tb All purpose flour
      3 oz Bittersweet or semisweet
           Chocolate, chopped fine
    1/2 c  Unsweetened Dutch Process
           Cocoa powder
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Boiling water
      2    Egg yolks
      1 tb Bourbon
      4    Egg whites, at room
           Temperature
           Scant 1/4 teaspoon cream of
           Tartar
     23 ts Powdered sugar
      8    Inch round spring form pan,
 2 1/16    Inches deep
 
  Position oven rack in the bottom third of the oven and preheat to 375.
  Spray the bottom and sides of the pan very lightly with vegetable oil
  spray.  In a clean dry food processor or blender, pulverize pecans and
  flour until the mixture resembles the texture of fine meal. Set
  aside. In a large mixing bowl, combine chopped chocolate, cocoa, and
  3/4 cup sugar. Add boiling water and whisk until chocolate is
  completely melted. Whisk in egg yolks and Bourbon. Set aside. Combine
  egg whites with cream of tartar in a medium mixing bowl.  Beat on
  medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually sprinkle in remaining
  sugar and beat on high speed until stiff but not dry. Whisk the flour
  and almonds into the chocolate mixture. Fold about one quarter of the
  egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it. Fold in the
  remaining egg whites. Scrape batter into prepared pan; level the top
  if necessary.  Bake 3035 minutes or until toothpick or wooden skewer
  plunged into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs clinging to
  it. Cool in the pan, on a wire rack.  Cake will sink like a souffle
  and the top crust may be broken and uneven.  Cooled cake may be
  covered and stored at room temperature or in the refrigerator one day
  ahead or frozen up to two months.  To unmold and serve:  Detach the
  cake from the pan by sliding a small knife around the sides of the
  cake, pressing close to the sides of the pan.  Release the spring and
  remove the pan sidesif the cake edges crack or break, do not eat or
  discard the pieces! Leave the cake on the bottom of the springform
  and transfer it to a serving dish. Gently replace any broken crust
  pieces. Sieve powdered sugar very lightly over the top to highlight
  the uneven surface and give the cake a rustic and appetizing appeal!

      1 lg Egg
      2 lg Egg whites
      2 ts Instant espresso powder
           Freeze dried coffee crystals
           (optional)
    1/2 c  Lowfat plain yogurt
      1 ts Vanilla
           Powdered sugar for dusting,
           Optional
           GLAZE:
    1/3 c  Light brown sugar
    1/4 c  Unsweetened Dutch process
           Cocoa powder
    1/3 c  Lowfat milk
    1/4 ts Vanilla
      6 c  Fluted tube pan sprayed with
           Vegetable oil spray
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Position rack in lower third of the
  oven. On low speed with an electric mixer, mix the sugar, flour,
  cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until thoroughly combined.
  
  Add the softened butter, whole egg, and egg whites.  Set a timer for 2
  minutes as you begin beating on medium speed.  As soon as the dry
  ingredients are moistened, increase the speed to high and continue
  mixing until the 2 minutes are up.  Stir the optional espresso powder
  into the yogurt, if you are using it.  Add the yogurt and vanilla to
  the batter. Beat at high speed for exactly 2 more minutes.
  
  Scrape the batter into the pan.  Bake 3035 minutes or just until a
  thin wooden skewer inserted in the center of the cake comes out
  clean. Do not over bake.  Cool in the pan on a wire rack for ten
  minutes before unmolding on the rack to cool completely.  Serve
  sprinkled with powdered sugar.
  
  Make the Glaze:  In a small heavy bottomed saucepan, combine the brown
  sugar with the cocoa.  Use a wooden spoon to stir in just enough milk
  to form a smooth paste.  Stir in the remaining milk. Cook over medium
  heat until mixture simmers, and finally begins to boil, stirring
  constantly and scraping the sides and bottom edges of the saucepan
  religiously. Boil gently for 1 1/2 minutes, stirring constantly to
  prevent burning. Off heat, stir in vanilla.  Cool to room
  temperature. Spoon glaze over cake.

      Title: Granita
 Categories: 
      Yield: 6 servings
 
MMMMM-----------------ESSENCE OF EMERIL #EE2173----------------------
      4 c  Simple syrup (see below)
      4 c  Cubed melon (about 2-3 small
           Ripe melons)
    1/4 c  Sweet white wine
      2 tb Lemon juice
      1    Egg in shell
           Mint sprig for garnish
      6    8 berries for garnish
 
  Make simple syrup: Place equal parts water and sugar, by weight,
  together in a sauce pot, bring to a boil and simmer until clear.
  Cool. It can be used to make sorbets, ices, moisten cakes, make
  drinks...etc.
  
  In a blender combine the melon, wine, lemon juice, and 2 cups of the
  simple syrup. Blend until smooth. Strain through a large holed sieve
  into a deep container. Test the mixture for freezing potential by
  placing the egg (shell and all) into the mixture. You want the egg to
  show the size of a nickel. Too much sugar will make the egg show more
  and not enough sugar will allow it to sink. Depending on the results
  of your test and the ripeness of your melon, adjust accordingly: Add
  more simple syrup if it doesn't show enough; water or wine if it
  shows too much. Pour the perfected mixture into a shallow, metal pan
  (a half hotel pan works great). Place it into the freezer. You can
  achieve the crystallized "shards" several ways; you can check this
  mixture several times while it freezes, stirring it with a fork each
  time to begin the crystallizing, or as I like to do, allow it to
  freeze completely and pulling towards myself with a large fork,
  shredding it into crystals. Either way, it will need to freeze 8-12
  hours. Serve it up in a pretty, frozen martini glass, garnished with
  berries and mint.

      4    Beefsteak tomatoes, halved
           And seeded
      3 tb Olive oil
      1 c  "quick" couscous, steamed
           According to package
           Directions
      2 tb Chopped or julienne basil
           Salt and ground pepper to
           Taste

MMMMM------------------------VINAIGRETTE-----------------------------
      2 tb Sherry vinegar
      1 tb Honey
      1 sm Jalapeno pepper, seeded and
           Finely diced
    1/4 ts Ground cumin
    1/4 c  Finely chopped scallions
           Salt and pepper
      4 tb Olive oil
 
  Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Cut the tomatoes in half and place them,
  cutside down, on a baker's rack set in a roasting pan and placed in a
  200 degree oven for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, the skins can be
  easily plucked off the tomatoes, using your fingers, a pair of tongs,
  or a fork.
  
  Drizzle the peeled tomato halves with olive oil and return them to
  the 200 degree oven for another 11/2 hours, until the tomatoes are
  roasted to a dark red. The excess moisture will have evaporated, and
  the remaining tomatoes will have a delicious concentrated flavor and
  aroma.
  
  Prepare the vinaigrette by combining the vinegar, honey, jalapeno,
  cumin, scallions and salt and pepper in a mixing bowl. Whisk together
  thoroughly before slowly drizzling in the oil completely. Cook the
  couscous according to the package directions. Cut the roasted tomato
  halves into quarters, and combine with the steamed couscous. Add the
  basil and adjust the seasoning. Drizzle with vinaigrette. And toss to
  combine.

MMMMM-------------------WHITE CHOCOLATE SAUCE------------------------
    1/2 lb White chocolate
    1/2 c  Water
      5    Berries of choice
 
  Mix all dry ingredients together in a bowl with a whisk. In a mixer
  or by hand, in a separate bowl whip egg whites to soft peaks. Add 1/2
  cup of sugar to egg whites and mix until stiff peaks form.
  
  In another bowl whisk yolks, vanilla extract and 1 cup of sugar to a
  ribbon stage. Add a small amount of dry ingredients to the yolk
  mixture and alternate with a little of egg whites. Using a rubber
  spatula, continue folding until all ingredients are combined.
  
  Bake at 375 degrees F on a greased half sheet tray or a cookie sheet
  lined with parchment and grease again. Bake approximately 12 to 14
  minutes or until springy and toothpick is almost dry. Do not overcook.
  
  STRAWBERRY OR RASPBERRY FILLING: In a blender combine ingredients for
  approximately 1 minute or until smooth. Reserve as filling.
  
  GANACHE FOR GLAZING CAKE: Whip egg yolks, sugar and vanilla until
  lightly fluffy. Cut chocolate into small pieces, place in sauce pan
  and add the cream. Heat to approximately 150 degrees F stirring
  constantly. Stir hot cream mixture into the egg yolks and continue
  stirring for 1 minute to assure that sugar is melted. Keep warm and
  ready for glazing.
  
  CHOCOLATE GARNISH WINGS: Melt over a double boiler and place into a
  piping bag or a parchment cone. On a separate sheet of parchment
  paper pipe out wings freehand or draw with a stencil to trace. Place

  melt white chocolate. Add water and mix until no lumps remain.
  Roughly chop berries and add to sauce. Reserve.
  
  TO ASSEMBLE CAKE: Take cake and cut into two triangles then cut each
  in half laterally. On bottom half, ladle berry filling and evenly
  distribute. Then apply white chocolate berry sauce. You can at this
  point add fresh berry slices if desired. Place top half back on top
  then place cake on a wire rack for glazing.
  
  Using warm ganache ladle glaze on top of cake and allow to run down
  sides. If ganache is thin add another coat.
  
  Place in refrigerator until glaze is solid. Take a whisk and splatter
  white chocolate sauce on top and decorate with more berries. With
  wings, they can garnish entire cake or you can use smaller wings to
  garnish each individual serving.

      Title: Tomato Marinated Potatoes
 Categories:

MMMMM-----------------ESSENCE OF EMERIL #EE2192----------------------
  1 1/2 lb Red skin potatoes,
           Quartered
      4 c  Water
      1 c  White wine vinegar
      1 tb Salt

MMMMM--------------------------MARINADE-------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Finely chopped tomatoes
    1/2 c  Finely chopped onions
      2 tb Dijon mustard
      2 tb Chopped thyme
      1 tb Chopped garlic
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      2 tb White wine vinegar
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Black pepper
 
  Place the potatoes in a medium pot with the water, vinegar, and salt.
  Bring to a boil, and simmer until they are tender. (The vinegar adds
  flavor as well as helps the potatoes to keep their shape even after
  they are tender.) When the potatoes are tender, drain and allow to
  cool for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl combine the
  tomatoes, onions, mustard, thyme, garlic, olive oil, vinegar, salt,
  and pepper. Mix well. Pour into a zip lock baggie. Place the still
  warm potatoes into the bag and coat. Allow the potatoes to sit until
  they are room temperature, seal the bag and into the cooler they go.
  The potatoes will absorb more flavor if they are still warm when
  added to the marinade.

  2 1/2 c  Sugar

      1    Vanilla bean

MMMMM-----------------------CONDENSED MILK----------------------------
      6 c  Nonfat milk
      5 tb Sugar

MMMMM--------------------------CARAMEL-------------------------------
      2 c  Sugar
  1 1/4 c  Water
 
  Condensed milk: In heavy saucepan pour milk and bring to a boil.
  Reduce to a simmer and cook for about 45 minutes, stirring
  occasionally. Stir in sugar and continue simmering 10 to 15 minutes,
  or until milk has reduced to 3 cups. Strain. Milk can be refrigerated
  for up to one week.
  
  Caramel: In medium-sized saucepan combine sugar and 1/2 cup of the
  water. Use a pastry brush dipped in cold water to wash down any sugar
  granules from the pot's sides. Cook over a moderate heat, swirling
  the pan occasionally, until the color is dark brown and the mixture
  has the distinctive fragrance of caramel, about 10 to 15 minutes.
  Pour caramel into a 9-inch round cake pan, coating the bottom and the
  sides, some caramel will be left over. Swirl to coat evenly. Slowly
  and carefully add the remaining 3/4 cup of water to the caramel left
  in the saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook over moderate heat until
  the caramel dissolves, about 5 minutes. Occasionally stir and brush
  down the sides with the pastry brush dipped in cold water to prevent
  crystallization. Set this caramel sauce aside to chill until serving
  time.
  
  Prepare the caramel and coat a 9-inch round cake pan, reserving the
  extra caramel sauce in the refrigerator as directed above. Preheat
  oven to 325 degrees. In large mixing bowl gently whisk together eggs,
  egg yolks, 1/2 cup sugar, vanilla extract and half-and-half. Whisk
  together without incorporating any air. In saucepan pour condensed
  milk. Split vanilla bean lengthwise and, using tip of a paring knife,
  scrape seeds into the milk. Add the bean and bring to a boil. Once
  milk has reached a boil, pour into egg mixture, whisking
  continuously, until fully combined. Pass through a strainer into the
  caramel coated cake pan. Place inside a large roasting pan and pour
  hot tap water into the roasting pan until it rises halfway up the
  sides of the flan. Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes, until
  the center feels firm when pressed. Set aside to cool in the pan of
  water. Once cool, remove from the water bath, cover with plastic wrap
  and refrigerate 4 to 6 hours or overnight. To serve, run a knife
  along the inside of the pan and gently press the center of the bottom
  to loosen. Cover with a platter, invert and lift off the pan. Excess
  caramel can be drained from the cake pan and added to the reserved
  caramel sauce. Cut in wedges and serve topped with cold caramel sauce.

      2    Dried hot peppers from
           Puglia

MMMMM---------------------BASIC TOMATO SAUCE--------------------------
    1/3    Spanish onion, cut into
    1/4    -inch dice
      2    Cloves garlic, thinly
           Sliced
      1 oz Virgin olive oil
  1 1/2 tb Fresh thyme (or 2
           TB dried)
    1/4 md Carrot, finely shredded
     28 oz Cans of tomatoes, crushed
           And mixed well with their
           Juices
           Salt, to taste
 
  BASIC TOMATO SAUCE: Saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil over
  medium heat until translucent, but not brown (about 10 minutes). Add
  the thyme and carrot and cook 5 minutes more. Add the tomatoes. Bring
  to a boil, lower the heat to just bubbling, stirring occasionally for
  30 minutes. Season with salt to taste. Serve immediately, or set
  aside for further use. The sauce may be refrigerated for up to one
  week or frozen for up to 6 months.
  
  Cut duck up into 10 pieces by splitting the breast and cutting each
  in half into 3 pieces, 2 thighs, 2 drumsticks and 2 wings. Save the
  liver and use it to thicken the sauce.
  
  In an 8 to 10-quart heavy bottomed braising pan or Dutch oven, heat 6
  tablespoons virgin olive oil over medium flame until smoking. Place
  duck pieces skin side down and cook until golden brown and most of
  the fat has been rendered. Cooking 4 to 6 pieces at a time, this
  should take 20 to 30 minutes. When done, drain pan of all but 2
  tablespoons of fat and add pancetta. Cook until lightly browned and
  add onion, celery, carrots and fennel seeds and cook until softened,
  about 10 minutes. Add olives, sweet wine, tomato sauce and hot
  peppers and bring to a boil. Submerge duck pieces and liver and bring
  to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer 1/2 hour, or until duck is
  falling off the bone. Remove duck and liver to platter with tortiera.
  Using a wooden spoon, chop liver to fine mush, return to pan and
  season sauce with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over duck and serve.

  the thyme and carrot and cook 5 minutes more. Add the tomatoes. Bring
  to a boil, lower the heat to just bubbling, stirring occasionally for
  30 minutes. Season with salt to taste. Serve immediately, or set
  aside for further use. The sauce may be refrigerated for up to one
  week or frozen for up to 6 months.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Trim most of the fat from the lamb and season with salt and pepper.
  In a heavy bottomed casserole (at least 6 quarts), heat olive oil
  until smoking. Brown lamb on both sides until dark golden brown and
  remove. Add onions, garlic, anchovies and orange pieces and cook
  until softened, scraping the casserole bottom with a wooden spoon to
  loosen the brown bits. Add olives, orange juice, wine and tomato
  sauce and bring to a boil. Add lamb, lower heat to a simmer and cook
  70 minutes, or until fork tender.

      Title: Red Snapper With Tomato-Onion Compote
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/4 c  Extra virgin olive oil
      3 c  Sliced onions
      8 md Tomatoes
      1 ts Sherry vinegar
      1 tb Minced tarragon
    3/4 ts Kosher salt
    1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      6    6-ounce red snapper fillets,
           Skin on
           Flour for dredging
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  In a skillet heat 2 tablespoons of
  the olive oil over moderate heat.  Add the sliced onions and cook,
  stirring occasionally until completely tender and sweet, about 30
  minutes. If any of the onions stick to the bottom of the pan, stir in
  a few tablespoons of water.  This will release the onions and coat
  them with a sweet caramelized flavor.  Set the pan aside. Core the
  tomatoes and cut them in half widthwise.  Place them cut side down on
  a lightly oiled baking sheet. Place the baking sheet on the oven's
  upper rack and roast until the skin blisters and begins to curl away
  from the tomatoes, about 30-40 minutes. When the tomatoes are cool
  enough to handle yet still warm, gently lift the skin from the tomato
  and squeeze out the seeds. Combine the tomatoes with the cooked
  onions.  Add the sherry vinegar and simmer over moderate heat,
  stirring occasionally until slightly thick. Stir in the minced
  tarragon, 1/4 teaspoon salt and half the pepper, and remove from the
  heat. The compote can be prepared up to one day ahead to this point,
  and stored, covered and refrigerated. Dredge the skin-side of the
  snapper in the flour and season both sides with the remaining salt
  and pepper. Heat the remaining olive oil in a large skillet over
  medium heat. Saute the snapper skin-side down for 4-5 minutes.  Turn
  the fish over with a spatula and cook an additional 1-2 minutes.
  While the fish is cooking return the compote to a simmer.  When the
  fish is done, transfer the compote to a serving platter and arrange
  the snapper fillets on top.

 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Idaho potatoes, peeled and
           Quartered
      2 ts Kosher salt
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
    1/2 c  Milk
    1/4 ts White pepper
 
  Place the potatoes in a 2-quart saucepan with 1 teaspoon of the salt
  and cold water to cover.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer,
  covered, until completely tender, about 30 minutes. Test the potatoes
  by piercing them with a paring knife:  there should be no resistance.
  Place in a colander and allow to drain well for several minutes.
  Combine the butter, heavy cream, and milk in another saucepan and
  heat gently until the butter has melted.  Keep warm. Working over the
  saucepan you used for the potatoes, pass the potatoes through a food
  mill or a potato ricer. If you have any difficulty, add a little of
  the hot milk and butter to the potatoes. To serve, place the potatoes
  over a low flame and begin adding the warm milk, cream and butter.
  Whip the potatoes with a wooden spoon or spatula while heating.  When
  all the liquid is absorbed, season with the remaining salt and white
  pepper.  Serve piping hot. Mashed potatoes are best served
  immediately, but if you are unable to do so, or need them for another
  recipe, keep the potatoes hot for up to one hour by placing them in
  the top of a double boiler, covered, and held over barely simmering
  water.

      Title: Chicken In Brachetto
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    4-pound chicken, cut into 10
           Pieces
      1    Bottle Brachetto wine
      1 c  Sliced white onion
      1 c  Sliced celery, washed
      1 c  Peeled and sliced carrots
      6    Cloves garlic, thinly
           Sliced
      1    Sprig each rosemary, thyme,
           Sage, basil, parsley
      1    Bay leaf
        sm Pinch whole black
           Peppercorns
      1 ts Kosher salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      3 tb Olive oil
      2 c  Fresh peeled, seeded and
           Chopped tomatoes
  1 1/2 tb Butter
      1 tb Chopped parsley
 
  At least one day before serving the dish, place the chicken in a large
  non-reactive casserole and add all the ingredients up to and
  including the peppercorns.  Stir the chicken around so that it will
  be well covered by the wine.  Cover the casserole and marinate the
  chicken overnight in the refrigerator. Place a colander over a
  saucepan and drain the chicken, reserving the wine.  Separate the
  chicken pieces from the vegetables, holding the vegetables on reserve
  for the moment. Arrange the chicken on a cookie sheet covered with
  paper towels and season the pieces well with the salt and black
  pepper.  Allow the chicken to sit with the seasoning for at least
  15-20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Heat the olive oil in
  a large heavy-bottomed lidded saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high
  heat. Begin sauteing the chicken, skin side down, without crowding
  the pan. As the skin slowly renders and browns, turn each piece over
  to quickly sear the other side.  Transfer the browned pieces of
  chicken to a platter and continue until all the chicken is done.
  Turn the heat to high and add the reserved vegetables to the pan.
  Cook until the vegetables are wilted and beginning to brown, then add
  the tomatoes and cook a few more minutes. Pour on the reserved red
  wine and scrape up any brown bits left clinging to the bottom of the
  pan. Return the chicken to the pan and bring the wine to a boil.
  Cover the pan tightly and place in the oven for 40 minutes. Remove
  the casserole from the oven and turn the oven off.  Allow the chicken
  to cool a few minutes.  Pour the chicken and sauce into a colander
  placed over a saucepan.  Transfer the chicken to a serving platter,
  and remove the herb stems and bay leaf.  Place the saucepan
  containing the red wine sauce on a medium flame and begin removing
  the fat from the surface. Allow the sauce to reduce for 10-15 minutes
  at a moderate simmer. Cover with aluminum foil and place in the oven
  to keep warm. Adjust the seasoning of the sauce, swirl in the butter,
  and spoon the sauce over the chicken. Sprinkle with the chopped
  parsley and serve immediately. The chicken can be prepared up to
  several days ahead and kept in the sauce, covered and refrigerated
  until ready to reheat.
  
  NOTE:  Brachetto is a delicious, slightly sweet and sparkling red
  wine from the Piedmont area of Italy.  If unavailable, try using a
  good quality Lambrusco, a similar wine from the Emilia-Romagna area,
  or another light red Italian wine like Valpolicella or Bardolino.

      Title: Creamy Polenta With Mascarpone
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      5 c  Milk
      1 c  Polenta (medium-grain yellow
           Cornmeal, not instant)
      5 tb Mascarpone cheese (2 1/2
           Ounces)
      1 ts Kosher salt
    1/8 ts Fresh ground white pepper
      3 tb Gorgonzola, crumbled (2
           Ounces) (optional)
    1/4 c  Shelled walnuts, lightly
           Toasted
 
  In a 2-quart, non-reactive saucepan, slowly bring the milk to a boil,
  stirring every few minutes with a wooden spoon to prevent scorching.
  To avoid lumpy polenta, follow this method carefully: Hold the cup of
  polenta in one hand and a firm whisk in the other. Slowly pour the
  polenta into the milk with a sprinkling motion, and whisk constantly
  until all the polenta is absorbed.
  
  Turn the heat down very low.  Switch back to the wooden spoon and
  thoroughly stir the polenta every ten minutes for one hour.  The
  polenta should have the consistency of firm mashed potatoes.  It will
  have completely lost any raw corn taste or gritty texture. Stir in the
  mascarpone and season with salt and white pepper.
  
  Preheat the broiler.  Spoon the polenta into a heat resistant dish,
  dot evenly with the crumbled gorgonzola and melt the cheese under the
  broiler. Sprinkle with the toasted walnuts and serve.

      1 c  Butter; unsalted, cold
      3    Egg yolks
      1 tb Water; cold
      1 tb Juice, lemon
           Salt
 
  In a small saucepan with a spout melt 3/4 of butter and set aside.
  
  In the top of double boiler or a heat-proof bowl whisk the egg yolks
  until they become thick and sticky. Whisk in the water, lemon juice
  and salt. Add a tablespoon of the remaining butter. Place the pan or
  bowl over a saucepan of simmering, not boiling, water. Whisk until
  mixture is warm, about 2 minutes. (If mixture appears to become lumpy
  dip pan immediately in a bowl of ice water to cool, whisk until
  smooth and then continue recipe.) The yolk mixture has thickened
  enough when you can see the bottom of the pan between strokes and
  mixture forms a light cream on the wires of the whip.
  
  Immediately remove from pan or bowl from heat and whisk in 1
  tablespoon of the remaining butter to cool the yolk mixture and stop
  the cooking.
  
  While whisking the yolk mixture gradually pour in the melted butter, a
  tablespoon or so at a time whisking thoroughly to incorporate before
  adding more butter. As the mixture begins to thicken and become
  creamy, the butter can be added more rapidly. Do not add the milk
  solids at the bottom of the melted butter.
  
  Season the sauce to taste with salt, white pepper and lemon juice. To
  keep the sauce warm, set the pan or bowl in lukewarm water or in a
  thermos.

      3    Egg yolks
      2 tb Cold unsalted butter
    1/2    To 2/3 cup melted unsalted
           Butter
      2 tb Minced fresh parsley or
           Tarragon
 
  In a small saucepan combine vinegar, wine, shallots, and tarragon and
  simmer over moderately heat until reduced to 2 tablespoons of liquid.
  Cool and strain through a fine sieve.
  
  In the top of double boiler or a heat-proof bowl whisk the egg yolks
  until they become thick and sticky.  Whisk in the reduced vinegar
  mixture, salt and pepper.  Add 1 tablespoon of the cold butter. Place
  the pan or bowl over a saucepan of simmering, not boiling, water.
  Whisk until mixture is warm, about 2 minutes.  (If mixture appears to
  become lumpy dip pan immediately in a bowl of ice water to cool,
  whisk until smooth and then continue recipe.)  The yolk mixture has
  thickened enough when you can see the bottom of the pan between
  strokes and mixture forms a light cream on the wires of the whip.
  
  Immediately remove from pan or bowl from heat and whisk in 1
  tablespoon of the remaining cold butter to cool the yolk mixture and
  stop the cooking.
  
  While whisking the yolk mixture gradually pour in the melted butter, a
  tablespoon or so at a time whisking thoroughly to incorporate before
  adding more butter.  As the mixture begins to thicken and become
  creamy, the butter can be added more rapidly.  Do not add the milk
  solids at the bottom of the melted butter.
  
  Season the sauce to taste with chopped herbs, salt and pepper. To
  keep the sauce warm, set the pan or bowl in lukewarm water or in a
  thermos.

      Title: Flaky Pie Shell
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/3 c  All-purpose flour
    3/4 ts Salt
    3/4 ts Sugar
      4 tb Cold unsalted butter, cut
           Into 1/2-inch dice
      4 tb Cold vegetable shortening,
           Cut into small pieces
      3    To 4 tablespoons ice water
 
  In a food processor, pulse the flour, salt and sugar until mixed. Add
  the butter and shortening and pulse until the mixture resembles
  coarse meal with particles the size of peas.
  
  Drizzle the ice water evenly over the mixture and pulse 8 to 12 times,
  until the dough forms small clumps.  Turn out the dough onto a work
  surface, scraping the bowl well.  Using the heel of your hand, gently
  press the dough into the table with a few quick strokes. Gather the
  dough together and flatten it into a disk about 4 inches in diameter.
  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours
  or overnight.
  
  Place the disk of chilled dough on a lightly floured surface and
  flour the top of the dough.  Using your hands, press the dough into a
  6-inch round. Smooth the cracking edges with your fingers.  Roll the
  dough lightly with a floured rolling pin into a 9-inch round,
  rotating and flipping the dough over every few strokes to ensure even
  thickness. If the dough sticks to the table or rolling pin, use a
  dough scraper and dust both again with flour. If the edges crack
  again, pinch them together with your fingers. Now roll out the round
  of dough from the center until it reaches a diameter of about 12
  inches or 1 1/2 inches larger in circumference than a 9-inch pie pan
  placed face down on the dough.  If the dough is sticking to the
  table, loosen it with a floured long metal spatula.
  
  Fold the dough round in half.  Center it over the pie pan and unfold
  it. Gently press the dough against the bottom and sides of the pan
  without stretching it.  Patch any holes in the dough by pressing
  scraps onto the tear.  If the edge of the dough is very uneven, trim
  it with scissors so that it overhangs the rim of the pan by 1-inch.
  The dough should touch but not drag on the table.  Fold the
  overhanging dough under and crimp decoratively.  (If you are
  pre-baking the crust, prick a few holes in the bottom of the shell
  with a fork.) Refrigerate the pie shell for at least 30 minutes or
  wrap and refrigerate for up to 2 days. (The pie shell can also be
  frozen for up to 2 months. Defrost overnight in the refrigerator.)
  
  To bake the crust:
  
  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.  Line the chilled pie shell with
  foil, making sure the foil completely covers the crimped edge (this
  may take an extra piece of foil) and weigh down with pie weights,
  dried beans or rice. Bake the shell in the center of the oven for 20
  to 30 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.  Take the pie
  out of the oven and remove the foil and weights.  The dough will look
  raw in the center. Bake the empty shell for 12 to 15 minutes longer,
  until golden brown all over.
  
  Yield: One 9-inch pie shell

      Title: Peach Pouch Pie With Berries
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Recipe of The Flaky Pie
           Shell, unbaked
           Filling:
    2/3 c  Plus 1 teaspoon sugar
      3 tb Cornstarch
      3 lb Ripe but firm peaches,
           Peeled and sliced 1/2-inch
           Thick (6 cups)
    1/2 c  Blueberries, picked over
    1/2 c  Raspberries, picked over
 
  On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled dough into a
  14-inch round. Using a 9-inch pie pan as a template, place it rim
  down on the dough and cut out a circle about 2 inches larger than the
  rim with a pastry wheel. Slide a long metal spatula underneath the
  dough to loosen it. Fold the dough round in half, center it over the
  pie pan and open it. Gently press the dough against the bottom and
  sides of the pan without stretching it. The dough should drag on the
  table. Set the pie pan on a bowl to allow the edge to hang down;
  refrigerate for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Place a
  piece of foil on the bottom of the oven to catch any drips. Make the
  filling: In a large bowl, whisk 2/3 cup of the sugar with the
  cornstarch. Gently toss in the peaches. Let sit for 10 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, remove the pie shell from the refrigerator. Gently toss the
  peaches. Let sit for 5 minutes longer. Combine the blueberries and
  raspberries and gently stir them into the peaches. Pour the fruit
  into the pie shell and distribute it evenly. Scrape in all the liquid
  and any undissolved sugar clinging to the bowl. When the dough is
  pliable, fold the overhanging edge to cover the outer portion of the
  filling, leaving a 5-inch opening of exposed fruit in the center of
  the pie.
  
  Using a pastry brush, moisten the surface of the dough with cold
  water. Sprinkle the remaining 1 teaspoon sugar over the dough. Bake
  the pie on the lower rack of the oven for 20 to 30 minutes, until the
  crust begins to brown. Then lower the temperature to 375 degrees and
  bake for 35 to 45 minutes longer, until the fruit is bubbling and the
  crust is nicely colored. Transfer to a rack to cool for at least 2
  hours.

      Title: Blueberry Lemon Souffle Pie
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 c  Blueberries, picked over
      1 tb Minute tapioca
      6 tb Granulated sugar
      3 lg Eggs, separated
      7 tb Superfine sugar
    1/4 c  Plus 3 tablespoons fresh
           Lemon juice (4 lemons)
           Grated zest of 2 lemons
    1/8 ts Salt
      1    Baked Flaky Pie Shell
 
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. In a nonreactive saucepan, toss the
  blueberries with the tapioca and granulated sugar. Let sit 5 to 10
  minutes, stirring once or twice, to soften the tapioca. Cook over
  moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture comes
  to the boil. Remove from the heat. Pour into a stainless steel
  strainer set over a bowl. Reserve the drained juices.
  
  Using an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks with 4 tablespoons of the
  superfine sugar until pale and thick, about 2 minutes. Gradually beat
  in the lemon juice and then the zest. Transfer the mixture to a
  nonreactive saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly with
  a rubber spatula, until it thickens, about 8 minutes; do not boil.
  Scrape into a bowl and set aside on a rack to cool. Strain.
  
  Using clean beaters, beat the egg whites until foamy. Add the salt
  and beat until soft peaks form. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons
  superfine sugar, 1/2 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each
  addition. Beat at high speed until the whites are glossy but not dry,
  about 20 seconds longer. Using a rubber spatula, stir one-third of
  the beaten whites into the yolk mixture. Gently fold in the remaining
  whites. Spoon the blueberries into the baked Flaky Pie Shell and
  drizzle 2 1/2 tablespoons of the drained juices over them. Mound the
  souffle mixture over the berries; spread gently to cover the berries,
  touching the pie crust all around. Bake in the middle of the oven for
  about 15 minutes, until the top is nicely browned. Transfer the pie
  to a rack to cool slightly. Serve warm or at room temperature.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Lemon Curd---
      1    Egg plus 2 egg yolks
    1/2 c  Freshly squeezed, strained,
           Lemon juice (about 2
           Lemons)
           Grated zest of 2 lemons
    1/2 c  Sugar
           Summer Berry Simmer---
  2 1/2 c  Mixed berries: strawberries
           Cut in quarters, blueberries
           Raspberries, blackberries,
           Plus a few extra berries
           For garnish
      2 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Water
      2 ts Pure vanilla extract
      1 pt Premium vanilla ice cream
 
  Make the lemon curd:
  
  In a medium saucepan, whisk together the egg and the yolks, lemon
  juice, lemon zest and sugar. Set over very low heat and, stirring
  gently and constantly with a rubber spatula, cook until it thickens,
  about 5 minutes. It will be just ready to boil. Don't let it. Strain
  into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside to cool to room
  temperature.
  
  Cook the berries:
  
  In a medium saucepan, toss the strawberries and blueberries with the
  sugar and water. Wash the side of the pot down with a wet pastry
  brush and cook over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the
  sugar is dissolved and the berries are soft but still intact, about 2
  minutes. If the sugar hasn't dissolved, add a few more drops of
  water. Stir in the vanilla extract. Remove the pot from the heat and
  add the more delicate berries. Do not stir; let the residual heat
  soften them. Transfer to a bowl to cool.
  
  Assemble the sundae:
  
  Add about a tablespoon of the berries to the bottom of 4 sundae
  glasses. Add a dollop of lemon curd to that and then spoon about 1/2
  cup of ice cream into each glass. Blanket the ice cream with more
  lemon curd and berries. Garnish with a few uncooked berries.

      Title: Cinnamon Crunch Shortcakes
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Biscuit Dough, (previous
           Recipe) patted into a
           Rectangle
      2 c  Raspberries
  1 1/2 c  Blackberries
      2 c  Blueberries
    2/3 c  Plus 1/2 cup sugar
      1    Stick butter
      2 ts Cinnamon
 
  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. On a lightly floured surface, roll
  out the biscuit dough 3/4-inch thick. Using a heart shaped or any
  other biscuit cutter that measures 3 inches at its widest point, cut
  out 5 shortcakes as close together as possible. Press the cutter
  straight down; don't twist it. If the cutter sticks to the dough, dip
  it in flour between cuts. Gather the scraps together and press or
  roll out as before. Cut out 2 more shortcakes. Press the remaining
  scraps into a ball, flatten and cut out the last shortcake.
  (Alternatively, on a lightly floured surface, pat the dough into an
  8-inch round. Halve the round, then cut each half into 3 wedges for a
  total of 6 triangular shortcakes.) Place the shortcakes on an
  ungreased baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.
  
  In a medium bowl, gently toss the raspberries and blackberries to
  combine. In a medium nonreactive saucepan, gently toss the
  blueberries with 2/3 cup of the sugar and 2 teaspoons of
  
  water. Cover and cook over moderate heat, stirring once or twice and
  brushing down the sides of the pan, just until the blueberries start
  to pop and release their juices, about 3 minutes. If the sugar hasn't
  dissolved, stir in a few more drops of water. Remove the pan from the
  heat and add the raspberries and blackberries. Do not stir. Transfer
  the berries to the bowl.
  
  Bake the shortcakes in the middle of the oven for about 15 minutes, or
  until golden brown. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small saucepan.
  In a small bowl, combine the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and the cinnamon.
  Immediately after removing the shortcakes from the oven, dip them in
  the butter and cinnamon sugar as follows. Holding a shortcake right
  side up, dip the bottom in the melted butter. Place the shortcake,
  buttered side down, in the cinnamon sugar and shake the bowl so that
  the sugar adheres to and completely covers the bottom. Then turn the
  shortcake over and dip the top in the butter and cinnamon sugar in
  the same manner. Place the shortcake right side up on a plate.
  Continue with the remaining shortcakes. (If the level of the butter
  is too low for dipping the last shortcake, use a pastry brush to
  generously brush the butter on the top and bottom of the biscuit.)
  
  Using your fingers, gently split open the shortcakes. Spoon about 1/2
  cup of the berries over the bottom of each shortcake. Cover with the
  shortcake tops and spoon a dollop of whipped cream alongside. Serve
  at once.

      Title: Strawberry Spiral Pie
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Strawberries, hulled, washed
           And drained
    2/3 c  Strawberry jam
      1 tb Unsalted butter
      1 tb Cornstarch
      1 tb Quick-cooking tapioca
    1/2 ts Ground ginger
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
    1/8 ts Nutmeg
    1/3    To 1/2 cup sugar, according
           To the sweetness of the
           Berries
           Biscuit Dough, (previous
           Recipe) patted into a
           Rectangle
 
  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees and line the oven floor with foil to
  catch any drips.
  
  Spread the strawberries on paper towels to dry. In a small bowl, stir
  the jam to loosen it. In a saucepan, melt the butter and keep warm.
  In a large bowl, whisk together the cornstarch, tapioca, ginger,
  cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar. Halve any very large berries. Gently toss
  the berries with the dry ingredients.
  
  On a floured surface, roll out the Biscuit Dough lightly flouring the
  dough if necessary into a 10 by 18-inch rectangle. Square off the
  corners. Brush the dough lightly with about half of the melted
  butter. Using an icing spatula, spread the jam over the rectangle,
  leaving a 1/2-inch border on one long side. Starting at the opposite
  long side, roll up the dough jelly-roll fashion and pinch the seam
  closed. Roll the log so that it is an even diameter, exactly 18
  inches long; turn the log seam side down. Using a large sharp knife,
  quarter the log, then cut each quarter into 3 equal pieces so that
  there will be 12 spiraled biscuits in all.
  
  Using a rubber spatula, fold the strawberry filling once to remix.
  Spoon the filling into a 9-inch glass pie plate and smooth the top.
  Arrange 8 biscuits around the perimeter of the pie and the remaining
  4 biscuits in the center. Don't push the biscuits down into the
  strawberries. Bake the pie for 20 minutes, or until the top is golden
  brown and the filling is bubbling. Lower the oven temperature to 350
  degrees, loosely cover the pie with foil and bake for 15 minutes
  longer. Transfer to a rack to cool for 30 minutes before serving.

      2 tb Cornstarch
      1 tb Quick-cooking tapioca
    1/4 ts Plus 3/4 teaspoon ground
           Ginger
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
      2 lb Red or black plums, pitted
           And sliced 3/8-inch thick (6
           Cups)
           Biscuit Dough (previous
           Recipe), patted into any
           Shape
      1 tb Unsalted butter, melted
           Garnish:
           Vanilla ice cream, or
           Whipped cream
 
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In a large bowl, whisk together 3/4 cup
  of the sugar, the cornstarch, tapioca, 1/4 teaspoon of the ginger and
  the cinnamon. Add the plum slices and toss gently to coat. Lightly
  butter the inside rim of six 1 1/2-cup ovenproof ramekins or baking
  cups. In a small bowl, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and
  3/4 teaspoon ginger. On a floured surface, roll out the Biscuit Dough
  1/8-inch thick, lightly flouring the dough if necessary. Using a
  round cutter that is 1/2-inch larger than the ramekins, cut out 6
  rounds. Cut small decorative shapes from the dough scraps for
  appliques if desired.
  
  Stir the plums and spoon them and their juice evenly into the
  ramekins; they should be about three quarters full. Place a round of
  dough over each ramekin, tucking the excess inside the rim. Press the
  dough gently to adhere to the rim. Brush the top of the dough with
  the melted butter.
  
  If using , affix the appliques on the top and brush them with butter.
  Sprinkle the top of each pie with about 1 teaspoon of the
  ginger-sugar. Using the tip of a sharp knife, slice a few vents in
  the dough. Place the ramekins on a baking sheet, making sure they
  don't touch one another. Bake for 20 minutes, then lower the
  temperature to 350 degrees and bake for 15 minutes longer, or until
  the tops are nicely browned and the filling is bubbling. Transfer the
  ramekins to a rack to cool for 30 minutes. Serve warm with ice cream
  or whipped cream.

  remaining berries. Combine them with the sugar and lemon juice in a
  bowl and let them macerate for a few hours.  When ready to assemble
  the cake, drain the berries, reserving the juice. For the whipped
  cream, combine all ingredients in the bowl of an electric mixer and
  whip cream until it holds a firm peak. To assemble, place one of the
  cake layers on a platter or cardboard and spread with whipped cream.
  Spread with the drained strawberry filling, then with another thin
  layer of whipped cream. Place second layer on and mask outside of
  cake with whipped cream. Press the sliced almonds against the side of
  the cake. To decorate, pipe 12 rosettes of the remaining whipped
  cream at the top border of the cake.  Decorate each rosette with a
  halved strawberry, cut side up. ---Chocolate Raspberry Cream Cake
  Version---
    1 1/2    cups cream 2 tablespoons butter 2 tablespoons light corn
  syrup 1 pound finely cut chocolate Fresh raspberries Milk chocolate
  shavings
  
  Omit whipped cream. Bring cream, butter and light corn syrup to a
  boil and remove from heat. Add chocolate and whisk until smooth. Cool
  until thickened. Beat on mixer with a paddle and use instead of the
  whipped cream. Decorate with raspberries instead of strawberries and
  use chocolate shavings instead of almonds.

      Title: Herb Roasted Chicken
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    (5 to 6) pound roasting
           Chicken
      4    Cloves garlic, crushed
      1 md Onion, coarsely chopped
      3    Bay leaves
      1 tb Each of dried thyme,
           Rosemary and sage
      3 tb Olive oil
           Salt and freshly ground
           Black pepper to taste
           Several sprigs fresh thyme,
           Rosemary and sage
      1 c  Chicken broth
           Butcher's twine
 
  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees and place a heavy roasting pan to
  preheat in the oven.  Season the inside of the chicken cavity with
  salt and pepper. Put the crushed garlic, chopped onion and dry herbs
  inside the cavity of the chicken.  Using the twine, tie the legs
  closed. Use the olive oil to rub the entire outside of the chicken
  with an even coat of oil. Pick the herb from the stem and coarsely
  chop them before sprinkling the herb liberally and evenly on the
  chicken. Place the chicken into the preheated roasting pan and roast
  at 425 degrees for the first 45 minutes of roasting. Reduce the oven
  temperature to 350 degrees and continue to roast for an additional 1
  hour.  Remove from the oven and pierce the thigh: if the juices run
  clear when pierced allow to rest on a platter for 15 to 20 minutes
  before carving.  If the juices are still pink return to the oven for
  more roasting time.
  
  While the chicken is resting, place the roasting pan on top of the
  stove, remove any chicken fat with a spoon, and, over medium heat,
  deglaze the pan drippings with the chicken broth.  Use a spoon to
  scrape up all the crusty bits (that's where the most concentrated
  flavor is) and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and strain the
  liquid into a gravy boat to pass at the table.

      Title: Roasted Potatoes With Garlic
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Or Fingerling potatoes
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      3 tb Unsalted butter
      3    Cloves garlic, peeled and
           Finely minced
      2 tb Chopped fresh thyme
      2 tb Chopped fresh flatleaf
           Parsley
           Salt and freshly ground
           Black pepper to taste
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  
  Leaving their skins on, scrub the potatoes with a brush to remove any
  dirt or blemishes.  Dry the potatoes with paper towels or a cloth.
  Leave whole, cut in half or in quarters, depending on the size of the
  potatoes. Pour the olive oil into a roasting pan or large cast iron
  skillet and heat in a 350 degree oven for ten minutes before adding
  the potatoes. Roast the potatoes for 45 minutes, until crisp. Shake
  the pan several times during cooking, so that the potatoes roll
  around to brown evenly.  Remove from the oven. Drain the potatoes on
  paper towels or a cloth to absorb the excess oil, then place in a
  serving dish.
  
  In a saute pan, melt the butter, add the garlic, and saute until light
  goldenbrown.  Add the chopped herbs to the garlic butter, stir
  together quickly, and remove from the heat.  Pour the garlic herb
  butter over the potatoes, season with salt and pepper, and serve.

      Title: Basic Pizza Dough
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  3 1/4 c  Unbleached flour
      2 ts Salt
      1 c  Warm water
      1    Envelope active dry yeast
      3 tb Olive oil
 
  In a bowl, combine the flour and salt, and mix thoroughly. In a
  separate stainless steel bowl, combine the water and yeast, and using
  a whisk, add 2 tablespoons of oil. Let rest for 5 minutes.
  
  Pour the water into the center of the flour, and with a spatula, stir
  to combine well into a sticky mass. Pour this mass out onto a lightly
  floured surface and begin to knead the dough by working the dough
  with the heel of the palm of your hand. Push outward and pull the
  inside edge over the top. Repeating the process over again to create
  a smooth ball of dough free of stickiness.
  
  Place the ball of dough into a clean stainless steel bowl that has
  been brushed with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Cover with
  a clean cloth and let rise at room temperature for 1 1/2 hours or
  until it has doubled in size.
  
  When the dough has risen it can be divided in half and the two pieces
  formed into two balls which will later be patted into the traditional
  pizza shape.
  
  Yield: 2 12-inch pizza crusts

      Title: Pizza With Tomato, Mozzarella And Basil
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 tb Olive oil
      1    Clove garlic, finely
           Chopped
      2 c  Canned plum tomatoes,
           Crushed by hand, seeds
           Removed
    1/2 ts Salt and pepper
      1 ts Dry oregano
      2    12-inch pizza crusts
      4 tb Grated Parmesan cheese
    1/2 lb Fresh mozzarella, thinly
           Sliced
      8    Basil leaves
           Ceramic pizza stone
           Pizza peel
 
  Set the pizza stone into a cold oven and preheat the oven to 450
  degrees.
  
  In a small sauce pan set over a low flame, heat 1 tablespoon of olive
  oil. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute before adding the tomatoes.
  Season the tomatoes with the salt, pepper and oregano and cook over
  medium heat for 10 minutes.
  
  Working on a lightly floured surface, pat one of the pizza dough
  balls into a flat round shape, working from the center outward. While
  forming the shape of a pizza crust, work with the tips of the fingers
  and form a 1/2-inch thick edge.  Continue to work outward trying to
  achieve as even a thickness as possible.
  
  When the pizza dough is formed into shape transfer the dough to the
  peel and drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the surface. Sprinkle
  half the Parmesan cheese evenly over the oiled pizza dough and spoon
  3 tablespoons of sauce over the surface.  Evenly spread half of the
  mozzarella over the tomato and finish building your pizza with a few
  basil leaves roughly torn by hand.  Place the pizza onto the pizza
  stone in the oven by sliding the pizza off of the peel and onto the
  hot stone. Repeat the process for the second pizza. Bake for 15 to 20
  minutes or until the surface is bubbling and the bottom of the crust
  is well browned.

      Title: Peach And Raspberry Cobbler With Buttermilk Biscuit Crust
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Filling:
  2 1/2    To 3 pounds firm, ripe
           Yellow-fleshed free stone
           Peaches, about 8 to
     10    Peaches
    1/2 pt Basket (about 1 cup) fresh
           Raspberries, or 1 cup thawed
           Frozen
           Raspberries, drained
    2/3 c  Sugar
      2 tb All purpose flour
           Crust:
    3/4 c  All purpose flour
    3/4 c  Cake flour
    1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda (if the dough is
           Made with cream or milk,
           Omit
           Baking soda)
      4 tb Cold, unsalted butter
    2/3 c  Buttermilk, cream or milk
           Glaze:
      1 tb Buttermilk, cream or milk
      1 tb Sugar
           One 1 1/2 quart ovenproof
           Baking dish
 
  To make the filling: Peel the peaches by cutting a cross in the
  blossom end of each and lowering them a few at a time into a pan of
  boiling water. Leave the peaches in the water for 20 to 30 seconds,
  then lift them out with a slotted spoon or skimmer and put them in a
  bowl of ice water. If the peaches are ripe, the skin will slip off
  easily. If it does not, remove skin with a sharp stainless steel
  paring knife. (If you have to use a knife to peel the peaches add an
  extra peach to make up for what is peeled away). Hold a peeled peach
  gently in your left hand over a mixing bowl. With a stainless steel
  paring knife, make a cut from stem to blossom end. The blade of the
  knife should touch the pit. Make another cut about 3/4 inch ahead of
  the first one along the circumference of the peach. Angle the knife
  blade so it meets the first cut at the pit. Twist the blade upward
  slightly and a wedge will fall off the peach into the bowl. Continue
  around the outside of the peach, cutting it into 8 or 10 wedges.
  Discard the pit and repeat with remaining peaches. Add the
  raspberries to the bowl. Combine the sugar and flour and gently fold
  them into the peaches and raspberries. Scrape the filling into the
  baking dish and dot the surface of the filling with butter. Set aside
  while preparing dough. Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and
  preheat to 450 degrees. In a bowl, combine the flours, salt, baking
  powder and baking soda and stir well to mix. Cut the butter into 8 or
  10 pieces and rub into the dry ingredients until the mixture
  resembles coarse meal (or pulse in a food processor fitted with the
  metal blade). Make a well in the center and add the buttermilk. Stir
  gently with a fork to mix in the buttermilk, being careful not to
  overwork the dough. Let the dough stand in the bowl for a minute or
  two to let the flours absorb the liquid. Flour the work surface and
  turn the dough out onto it. Fold the dough over on itself 2 or 3
  times, until it is smooth and less sticky. Lightly re-flour the work
  surface and the dough and roll the dough to a little less than
  1/4-inch thick and the approximate size of the baking dish. Transfer
  the dough to the top of the filling (use a large, floured cookie
  sheet, sliding it under the dough, then easing it off onto the
  filling, for best results) and trim away any excess dough around the
  rim of the dish. Flute the edge of the dough at the rim of the dish.
  Slash 4 or 5 vent holes, each about an inch long, in the center of
  the dough; paint with buttermilk and sprinkle with sugar. Bake the
  cobbler for about 20 minutes, or until the crust is deep golden brown
  and the filling is bubbling gently. (To avoid dirtying the oven from
  spills, center a large baking pan covered with a sheet of foil on the
  bottom rack of the oven, directly under the cobbler. This will catch
  any juices that boil out of the cobbler.) Cool on a rack. Serve the
  cobbler warm or at room temperature. Use a large spoon to cut and
  place a portion of the top crust on a plate, then spoon some of the
  filling next to the crust.
  
  BLUEBERRY LEMON COBBLER: Substitute 2 pints blueberries, rinsed,
  drained and picked over for the peaches. Add 1 teaspoon finely grated
  lemon zest, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg to the
  sugar and flour.
  
  Double the crust for a lattice top.
  
  To make a lattice crust: Lightly flour the work surface and dough and
  shape the dough into a square, by pressing the sides against the work
  surface. Roll the dough to a 9 by 12-inch rectangle. Cut the dough
  the short way into 24 strips, each 1/2-inch wide and 9 inches long.
  Arrange 12 of the strips, 1/4 inch apart, on a floured cookie sheet
  or the floured back of a jelly-roll pan. Position the pan so that the
  strips are facing vertically to you. Beginning with the first strip
  of dough on your left, fold every other strip in half, back toward
  you. Place one of the reserved 12 strips of dough horizontally across
  the unfolded strips, just above the fold of the other strips, as in
  the illustration. Unfold the strips away from you, back to their
  original position, over the horizontal strip. Now begin with the
  second vertical strip from your left and fold back every other strip
  again. Insert another horizontal strip and unfold the vertical
  strips. Repeat steps 5 through 9 twice more until you have inserted 6
  horizontal strips to the top of the pan. Turn the pan 180 degrees and
  repeat the process, beginning with the first vertical strip, and
  inserting 6 more horizontal strips of dough, that is steps 5 through
  9, three more times. Gently press the top of the lattice to make the
  strips stick together slightly, and refrigerate the lattice until
  firm, which will make it easier to slide onto the pie.

 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Whole milk
      4 lg Eggs lightly beaten
      1 c  All purpose flour
      1 ts Salt
 
  With a whisk, beat eggs and milk together and add the salt.
  Gradually, a tablespoonful at a time, whisk in flour and beat until
  smooth. Heat a 6inch skillet and butter it lightly.  Pour in enough
  batter to make a thin pancake.  (If batter is too thick, add water to
  thin) Pour out excess back into the batter and don't worry if a "tab"
  forms on the side of the pan.
  
  Cook the blintz on one side only until the top blisters and it looks
  dry around the edges.  Turn the blintz upside down onto a clean
  towel. Rebutter the skillet if need be, every 2 or 3 blintzes, and
  proceed until all the batter has been used up.
  
  Make assorted fillings, roll up and fry, or bake or freeze for
  another day.

 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Shaped blintzes of choice
           Butter for frying, optional
 
  Spoon a tablespoon of filling in the center of each pancake.  Fold
  both sides in towards the middle and roll up into a rectangular shape.

  butter. Fry the blintzes slowly on one side until golden brown, then
  turn and fry on the second side.
  
  If the blintzes are frozen, don't thaw them.  Fry them frozen, but
  keep the heat very low, cover the pan for the first 7 to 8 minutes,
  then turn them over and fry uncovered on the second side.
  
  To bake, set them on a baking sheet and bake in a 425 degree oven
  until golden brown.
  
  FINISHING TOUCHES
  
  Serve cheese or fruit filled ones with sour cream or jam.  Serve

      Title: Chicken And Vegetable Terrine
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 lb Carrots, peeled
    3/4 lb Haricots verts, parboiled
           For 5 minutes or until
           Tender
  1 1/4 lb Ground chicken
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
    1/4 c  Finely chopped shallots and
      1    Clove garlic cooked until
           Tender in 2
           TB butter
      1 lg Clove garlic, minced
    1/4 c  Champagne or white wine
           Vinegar
      1    Egg lightly beaten
    1/4 c  Soft white bread crumbs
    1/2 c  Pitted black Nicoise olives
           Salt and freshly ground
           Black pepper
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and lightly grease an 8 x 4 inch
  glass loaf pan. Cut the carrots into strips the length of the carrots
  but only 1/4 wide (should be evenly cut 1/4inch square). Parboil for
  6 to 7 minutes or until cooked through but still with some texture to
  them. Puree ground chicken a little bit at a time in a food processor
  with the oil and vinegar and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1/4 teaspoon
  pepper. Add cooked shallots, garlic, bread crumbs and egg and puree
  until very smooth.
  
  Divide chicken puree into 3 bowls. In one add the carrots; in the
  other the green beans and leave the puree plain in the third. Using
  your hands mix the vegetables into the chicken mixture in each bowl
  making sure they are completely coated. Set a tiny bit of plain
  chicken puree in bottom of loaf pan, spreading it with a rubber
  spatula to cover entire bottom surface. Then cover with a layer of
  carrot, keeping carrots in as straight a line as possible. Next layer
  green bean mixture over carrots. With a spatula layer some plain
  chicken binder on top of green beans just enough to barely coat them.
  Then set a row of black olives down the center. Dot olives with a
  paper thin layer of plain chicken binder. Then repeat green bean
  layer, then top with the carrot layer and finally a layer of chicken
  binder which should entirely cover vegetables. Cover the top with
  buttered brown paper pressing paper directly on top of terrine. Cover
  top with foil.
  
  Tap the loaf pan on the counter a few times to eliminate air bubbles.
  Place terrine in a larger pan filled with enough boiling water to
  reach 3/4 of the way up the sides of the loaf pan. Set in oven and
  bake for 1 hour.
  
  Remove the pan from the oven. Let terrine rest for another hour or
  until it is cooler. Leave the foil cover on. Drain off excess water.
  Run a sharp knife between the terrine and the pan to loosen then
  carefully turn it upside down on a board. Terrine should come out
  easily. Pat dry with paper towels. Wrap in plastic wrap, then in foil
  and let it cool in fridge for 3 hours or overnight.

      Title: Boston Trifle
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Sifted cake flour
      7 tb Granulated sugar
      7 tb Granulated sugar, plus 1
           TB granulated sugar
      7 lg Eggs, room temperature
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 ts Cream of tartar
 
  Position rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 300 degrees. Pour
  the flour and 7 tablespoons of sugar in that order into a triple
  sifter or sieve.  Sift onto a sheet of waxed paper, and set aside.
  (Sifting the two together disperses and separates the particles of
  flour so that when dry ingredients are added later to the batter,
  folding in the flour is easier and more efficient, requiring less
  folding to incorporate. Measure the additional 7 tablespoons and 1
  tablespoon of granulated sugar; set aside. Separate the eggs, placing
  the whites in the bowl of a heavyduty mixer and yolks in a 1 1/2
  quart bowl.  (A deep bowl this size makes it more efficient for
  whipping the yolks thoroughly since it minimizes the surface area.)
  With an electric hand mixer, whip the yolks on high speed (#10) for 3
  to 5 minutes.  Add the vanilla, and continue whipping for 15 seconds
  to incorporate; the mixture should appear thicker, pale yellow, and
  increased in volume.  Test the consistency by lifting some of the
  mixture with the beaters.  If it flows back into the bowl in ribbons
  that slowly dissolve on the surface, proceed to whipping the whites.
  But if the ribbons sink into the surface immediately, continue
  whipping until the yolks have the desired consistency. Attach the
  bowl of whites to the mixer, and with the whisk attachment, whip on
  mediumlow speed (#3) for 30 to 45 seconds to break them up.  When
  small bubbles appear and the surface is frothy, stop the machine, and
  sprinkle the cream of tartar and the 1 tablespoon granulated sugar in
  the center.  Resume whipping, increasing speed to medium (#5), for 4
  to 5 minutes, or until the whites appear glossy and stiff but not dry
  or granular. Detach the whisk and bowl, tapping the whisk against the
  side of the bowl with enough force to free the excess.  Pour the
  yolks onto the whites (notice they float on the surface).  Using just
  a few strokes, fold the two together with a rubber spatula.  Don't be
  concerned if some of the yolks remain visible.  Sprinkle half of 7
  tablespoons sugar over the surface, and fold to incorporate. Sprinkle
  with the remaining sugar, folding again to incorporate. With the aid
  of a metal spatula, scoop a third of the flour, and sprinkle it over
  the egg mixture; with a rubber spatula, fold to incorporate. Repeat
  two more times, folding just until incorporated after each addition.
  Gently pour batter into an ungreased 9-inch springform pan with the
  aid of a rubber spatula and smooth the surface level.  Bake for 55 to
  60 minutes, or until the top is golden. (The batter hardly rises
  during the first 20 to 30 minutes of baking. The low oven temperature
  allows the batter to absorb heat slowly, so rising is gradual.
  Toward the end of baking the cake may mound high above the pan's rim.
  That's fine.  As it cools, this dome will contract a bit.) When
  finished baking, the cake should feel spongy, springing back slightly
  upon being lightly touched.  A toothpick, inserted in the center,
  comes out free of cake.  The toothpick is the last test for this cake
  before you judge if it is finished baking and remove it from the
  oven. If in doubt, baking 5 to 7 more minutes will not harm the cake.
  Remove spongecake from the oven, and immediately turn it upside down,
  positioning the edges of the pan on the inverted glasses.  This
  position, defying gravity, allows the cake to maintain its spongy
  structure without deflating while cooling. Cool the cake for 2 hours;
  then turn the pan right side up, and place it on the counter.  Though
  the cake is cool to the touch, let it sit for at least 1 more hour to
  cool the inside completely.  (The cake's structure is less fragile
  when cool, making removal easier.) To release the spongecake and
  maintain its shape perfectly, remove it from the pan as follows:
  Carefully loosen the cake crust that is stuck to the top rim of the
  pan; insert a thin metal spatula down 1/8 inch, and loosen and free
  the crust all around the cake.  Then tilt and rotate pan, tapping it
  gently on the counter to free the sponge from the metal sides. Tap
  more if it is not completely released.  Finally, release the spring
  mechanism, and slowly remove the rim.  (You'll notice the cake seemed
  to have had a slipcover because a thin, crusty layer of cake remains
  on the springform rim; it's delicious, too.)  Now tilt the cake on
  its side, and gently tap the metal bottom on the counter.  Rotate the
  cake as you tap until the removable bottom appears free.  Additional
  tapping may be necessary before it comes off completely. Patience
  will ensure a perfectly shaped cake.
  
  Yield: one 9inch round cake

      Title: Trifle Custard Filling
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/3 c  Half and half
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      4    Egg yolks
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
    1/4 c  Unsifted all purpose flour
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 ts Dark rum
      1 c  (8 ounces) heavy cream
 
  Pour the halfandhalf into a 1 1/2 quart heavybottomed saucepan, add
  the 1/2 cup sugar, and stir to combine. In a 1 quart bowl whisk the
  egg yolks and the remaining 1/2 cup sugar to combine. Add the flour,
  and whisk to combine. Bring the halfandhalf mixture just to a boil
  over medium heat. Remove, and pour half of the hot liquid over the
  yolk mixture, whisking to combine. Pour the yolk mixture into
  saucepan, and over medium heat bring it to a boil again, stirring
  constantly. When it is thick and smooth, remove it from the heat,
  pour it into a 3 quart mixing bowl to cool, and cover the surface
  with plastic wrap to prevent a crust from forming on the cream. (This
  bowl size is to allow room for folding in the whipped cream later.)
  Pierce the plastic with the tip of a knife to let steam escape and
  cool faster. Refrigerate.
  
  Assembling the Trifle:
  
  Split the spongecake evenly into three layers, each about 7/8-inch
  thick, using a 12inch serrated knife in a sawing motion. Lift the top
  two layers, one at a time, and set aside (this is easy because each
  layer is spongy and thick).
  
  Stir the vanilla and rum into the cold custard. Whip the heavy cream
  in a 1 1/2 quart mixing bowl to the Chantilly stage, and fold into
  the custard mixture. Place the bottom cake layer of cake in a 2 1/2
  to 3 quart glass bowl, and cover it with half of the filling,
  spreading evenly with a rubber spatula. Center the middle layer on
  top, and cover it with the remaining filling. Center the last layer
  on top. Cover the dessert with plastic wrap and refrigerate.
  
  Spoon 1 cup of the ChocolateButter Glaze into a 1 quart bowl over a
  bowl of hot tap water (120 to 130 degrees). Stir until liquid and
  smooth. Spread the glaze over the top of the dessert evenly with a
  metal or rubber spatula. With a 2inch paring knife, scrape the tip of
  the blade firmly but gently down a bar of chocolate. If the
  chocolate's surface area is cool, you will get fine flakes; if it's
  slightly warm, the shapes will be very small corkscrews. Sprinkle
  Chocolate Flakes around the rim of the dessert. Refrigerate for up to
  1 to 2 hours before serving.

      Title: Americana Banana Roll
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Sifted cake flour
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/8 ts Baking powder
    1/8 ts Salt
      1 lg Egg, room temperature
    1/2 c  (1 large) mashed ripe
           Banana
      1 tb Sour cream
      1 ts Lemon zest
  5 1/2 tb Unsalted butter, room
           Temperature
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
 
  Position rack in lower third of oven; preheat oven to 375 degrees.
  Using a paper towel, lightly grease a small area in the center of a
  12 x 15 1/2 x 1/2-inch baking sheet with solid shortening, and line
  the pan with foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang at each short end (the
  dab of shortening holds the foil in place). Lightly grease the foil
  with shortening, and sprinkle with allpurpose flour. Shake the pan to
  distribute flour, and tap out excess.
  
  Pour the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in that order
  into the triple sifter or sieve. Sift onto a sheet of waxed paper to
  distribute the ingredients; set aside. Crack the egg into a small
  bowl, and whisk briefly just to combine the yolk and white. Combine
  the mashed banana, sour cream, and lemon zest in a small bowl; set
  aside.
  
  Place the butter in the bowl of a heavyduty mixer. With the flat
  beater (paddle), cream the butter on medium speed (#5) for 30 to 45
  seconds, or until it is smooth and lighter in color. (This is a small
  amount in a large bowl, but you can adjust most heavyduty machines so
  the attachment reaches lower in the bowl.) Maintaining the same
  speed, add the sugar in a steady stream. Then stop the mixer, and
  scrape the mixture slinging to the sides into the center of the bowl.
  Continue to cream at the same speed until the mixture is light in
  color and fluffy in appearance (about 3 to 4 minutes).
  
  With the mixer still on medium speed, pour in the egg, very
  cautiously at first, as if you were adding oil when making
  mayonnaise. Continue to cream for 1 to 2 more minutes, scraping the
  sides of the bowl at least once. When the mixture is quite fluffy and
  has increased in volume, detach the beater and bowl. Tap the beater
  against the edge of the bowl to free the excess.
  
  With the aid of a metal spatula, lift half the flour mixture, and
  sprinkle it over the creamed mixture. Stir it in with a rubber
  spatula. Then add the mashed banana mixture, stirring to blend.
  Scrape the sides of the bowl with each addition. Add the remaining
  flour mixture, and stir until smooth.
  
  Scoop the thick batter onto five different areas over twothirds of the
  prepared baking sheet. With a metal spatula, spread and coax the
  batter to cover the twothirds of the sheet. Now extend it to the rest
  of the sheet in as even a layer as possible. (At first you will not
  believe it will cover the entire sheet, but it will. You do not have
  to rush. The layer will be very thin, but that is just the way it
  should be. It will increase in volume in the oven.) Bake for 8 to 10
  minutes, or until the cake is light golden brown, the sides are
  beginning to contract from the metal, and the cake springs back when
  lightly touched in the center. Remove the pan from the oven. Using a
  thinbladed knife, gently release any portion of the cake sticking to
  the long sides of the pan. Pull up on the foil overhangs, one at a
  time, to release foil from the pan's edges. Finally, loosen foil from
  the bottom of the pan by gently lifting up on the flaps, and transfer
  it to a large rack to cool.
  
  Place a sheet of foil over the cake, and manipulate the foil in a tent
  fashion (this holds in the moisture as it cools, but prevents
  sticking to the cake). Cool for 30 minutes.

      Title: Americana Banana Roll Filling
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    3/4 c  (6 ounces) heavy cream
      2 tb Sour cream
      1 tb Granulated sugar
      1 ts Vanilla
 
  Combine the filling ingredients in a 1 1/2 quart deep mixing bowl,
  and whip them until some cream dropped from the beater or whisk does
  not disappear on the surface of the mixture in the bowl. Another test
  is to draw the beater or whisk through the center of the cream in the
  bowl; if the track stays in place, you are ready to spread the
  filling on the cake. The cream will appear soft, shiny, and smooth
  but stiffer than for most desserts. It will coat the cake layer,
  sticking to it and staying in place when rolled.
  
  Assembling The Dessert:
  
  Lift the cake on its sheet of foil so that one of its long sides is
  parallel to the edge of your counter. (The cake will be rolled
  lengthwise.) Spread the cream evenly over the cake with a rubber
  spatula, up to 1 inch before reaching the long end farthest from you.
  (Some of the filling will move to that end as you roll.)
  
  Begin rolling by flipping the edge of the cake nearest you over onto
  itself. Then, with the aid of the foil that extends on either side of
  the cake, roll the cake lengthwise until you reach the other end.
  With you hands, wrap some of the roil around the roll to assist you
  in rounding the shape as you work toward the other end of the cake
  (otherwise, the cake will stick to your hands).
  
  Cut each end of the roll on the diagonal for eye appeal, and sprinkle
  a light coating of powdered sugar over it to disguise any cracks in
  the cake. Lift it onto a serving plate with the aid of a long, wide
  spatula or a baking sheet without sides. If desired, decorate top of
  roll with Glazed Raspberries.
  
  Glazed Raspberries:
  
  1 cup fresh raspberries, room temperature 3 tablespoons red currant
  jelly
  
  To decorate the top of the roll, place the raspberries into a 3 quart
  bowl. Heat currant jelly just until it's almost melted, but not hot.
  Pour the jelly through a strainer over the berries (push it through
  the strainer with a rubber spatula.) Gently slide the rubber spatula
  under the berries, and fold the two together. Repeat this three more
  times. The object is to coat the berries evenly. Carefully scoop the
  raspberries on top of the cake, down the length of the roll.

  degrees for 15 minutes, then lower the heat to 350 degrees and cook
  for 1 1/2 hours.
  
  When cooked, there will be lots of lovely juices in the bottom of the
  pan. Save them to flavor soup, stocks, or eggs. Remove the loaf and
  place on a serving dish. Serve hot or cold with a tomato sauce.
  
  For children, you might like to turn it into a hedgehog by pressing
  almonds into the meat to create prickles and placing 3 olives to form
  eyes and a nose. This should be done before the meat goes into the
  oven.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Apple filling:
      2 lb Golden Delicious apples
    1/2 c  Sugar
      3 tb Butter
      1 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
      2 tb Dark rum
           Breton Dough:
      2    Sticks butter
      1 c  Sugar
      1 tb Dark rum
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      4    Egg yolks
  2 3/4 c  All-purpose flour
           Egg wash:
      1    Egg well beaten with a pinch
           Salt
 
  Butter and line with parchment paper a 10 by 2-inch deep layer pan.
  Set a rack in the lowest level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.
  
  For the apple filling, peel, core and slice the apples into a large
  saucepan. Add the remaining ingredients and cook the apples covered
  until they exude their juices. Uncover the apples, lower the heat and
  allow juices to evaporate. Cool the filling.
  
  For the dough, beat the butter until soft and beat in the sugar in a
  stream. Continue beating until the mixture lightens. Beat in the rum
  and vanilla, then the yolks, one at a time, beating until the mixture
  is very smooth and light. Beat in the flour until it is absorbed,
  without over mixing. Set the paste aside, covered.
  
  Place half the dough in the bottom of the prepared pan. Press the
  dough with the fingertips evenly over the bottom of the pan and about
  1 inch up the sides of the pan. Spread the cooled filling on the
  dough. Flour the remaining dough and press it into a 10-inch disk on
  a cardboard or tart pan bottom. Slide the dough over the filling and
  press it into place making sure that the sides are straight and even.
  Brush the top of the Breton with the egg wash and trace a lattice
  pattern on it with the tines of a fork. Bake for about 40 to 45
  minutes, or until well colored and firm. Cool on a rack in the pan
  for 20 minutes, then unmold and cool completely.

      Title: Torta Caprese
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      6 oz Semisweet chocolate
  1 1/2    Sticks unsalted butter
    2/3 c  Sugar, divided
      8 lg Eggs, separated
  1 1/3 c  Walnut pieces, about 5 1/2
           Ounces
    1/3 c  All purpose flour
           Confectioners' sugar
 
  Butter and line with parchment paper a 10 by 2-inch deep layer pan.
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees, setting a rack in the middle level.
  
  Cut the chocolate finely and place in a small bowl over hot water to
  melt, stirring occasionally. Remove the bowl from the pan and cool
  the chocolate slightly. In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter with
  half the sugar until soft and light. Beat in the chocolate, then the
  yolks, one at a time, scraping bowl and beaters often. Continue
  beating until the mixture is smooth and light. Place the walnuts in
  the bowl of a food processor and grind them finely, pulsing the
  machine on and off at 1-second intervals. Be careful that the walnuts
  do not become pasty. Stir the walnuts, then the flour into the
  batter. In a clean, dry bowl, beat the egg whites until they hold a
  soft peak and beat in the remaining sugar in a slow stream. Beat the
  whites until they hold a soft, glossy peak. Stir 1/4 of the whites
  into the batter, then fold in the rest with a rubber spatula, so that
  no streaks remain. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth
  the top. Bake the Torta Caprese about 40 minutes, until the center is
  firm when pressed with a fingertip. Cool the cake in the pan for 10
  minutes. The cake may sink slightly, although this does not affect
  its texture. Trim off any loose crust and invert the cake on a rack,
  remove the pan and allow to cool completely. Dust the cake with
  confectioners' sugar and slide onto a platter.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  Unblanched hazelnuts, about
     10    Ounces
    1/2 c  Fine, dry bread crumbs
      4    Eggs, separated
      3 tb Sweet Marsala or dark rum
    2/3 c  Sugar, divided
      1 pn Salt
      1    Stick unsalted butter,
           Melted
 
  Butter and line with parchment a 10 by 2-inch deep layer pan. Set a
  rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.
  
  Place the hazelnuts in a food processor and grind them finely,
  pulsing on and off, to avoid making them oily. Pour them into a bowl
  and pour the bread crumbs over them without mixing. Beat the yolks in
  a mixing bowl and beat in the Marsala, then half the sugar and
  continue beating until very light by hand, with a hand mixer set at
  medium speed, or in a heavy duty mixer fitted with the whip. In a
  clean dry bowl, whip the egg whites with the salt and continue
  whipping until the whites hold a very soft peak, by hand, with a hand
  mixer set at medium speed, or in a heavy duty mixer fitted with the
  whip. Increase the speed and whip in the remaining sugar in a
  
  slow stream. Whip the egg whites until they hold a soft, shiny peak.
  
  Fold the yolk mixture into the whites, then fold in the hazelnut and
  bread crumb mixture and when it is half incorporated, pour the melted
  butter down the side of the bowl, continuing to fold until the batter
  is smooth. Be careful not to over mix the batter or it will deflate.
  Cut through the center of the bowl with a rubber spatula, making sure
  that the end of the spatula reaches down to the bottom of the bowl on
  every pass through the batter, so that none of the ingredients remain
  unmixed at the bottom of the bowl.
  
  Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake the Torta about 30
  minutes or until the top is well colored and the center is firm when
  pressed with a fingertip. Cool the Torta in the pan for a minute,
  then loosen it from the pan with the point of a small paring knife.
  Invert it onto a rack, then invert it again so that it cools on the
  paper. Serve lightly dusted with confectioners' sugar. Keep the Torta
  tightly covered at room temperature or in the refrigerator. If it has
  been refrigerated, allow it to come to room temperature before
  serving.

  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a casserole large enough to hold
  the meat, heat the butter. When foaming subsides add the onions and
  carrots and saute for about 10 minutes or until they take on some
  color. With a slotted spoon remove them and reserve for later.
  
  Add the oil to the casserole and heat over high heat. Add the beef and
  brown the meat on all sides; this should take 15 minutes to get a deep
  golden color. Return the vegetables to the casserole, stuffing them
  underneath the meat. Add the garlic, tomatoes, bouquet garni. Heat the
  casserole until you hear it sizzle, drape the meat loosely with
  aluminum foil, cover the casserole tightly and place it in the lower
  third of the oven.
  
  Cook for 1 hour, turn the meat over, lower the heat to 325 and
  continue to cook until the beef is tender, another 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
  Remove the meat to a platter. Strain cooking juices into a saucepan,
  pressing down hard on the vegetables to extract their liquid. Let
  liquid settle for a minute, then skim off surface fat. Heat the
  liquid and reduce slightly; adjust seasoning. Slice the roast and
  spoon the gravy over the top. Serve with braised carrots and boiled
  parslied potatoes (make extra for cold potato salad and beef salad
  next day).

  In a blender, place the chiles and cilantro. Add the eggs, water,
  milk, salt, baking powder, cornmeal, flour, sugar, and oil. Blend
  until very smooth. Let the batter rest at room temperature 30 minutes
  to 1 hour.
  
  Heat an 8 to 9inch, wellseasoned crepe pan or small skillet over a
  medium heat. Coat with a little vegetable oil. When the pan is hot,
  pour in about 2 to 3 ounces of the crepe batter. Tilt the pan,
  rotating so the batter is evenly distributed. Cook until the crepe
  appears dry, then turn and cook on the other side. Repeat until all
  the batter is used. Store the crepes between sheets of wax paper
  until ready to use.

      Title: Lucerne Cheese Torte Part 1
 Categories: Baker
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Sifted cake flour
      1 tb Granulated sugar
    1/8 ts Salt
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      4 lg Eggs, room temperature
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      1 ts Vanilla
 
  Position rack in lower third of over 5 to 6 inches from the bottom and
  preheat to 350 degrees.  Using a paper towel, grease the bottom and
  sides of a 8-inch round pan with solid shortening.  Dust generously
  with allpurpose flour, tilt to distribute, then tap out excess, and
  insert a parchment or waxed paper liner.
  
  Pour the flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, and salt in that order into a
  triple sifter or sieve.  Sift onto a sheet of waxed paper to
  distribute the sugar evenly and to remove any lumps in the flour, set
  aside. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat.  Pour into
  a 1 quart mixing bowl, and set aside.
  
  Crack the eggs into the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer.  Add the 1/2 cup
  sugar, and whisk by hand to combine.  Rest the bowl in a shallow pan,
  such as a 10 inch skillet, filled with 1-inch of water that feels hot
  to the touch (120 degrees).  To prevent the eggs from setting, whisk
  them continuously for about 30 seconds.  Now test if the mixture has
  warmed to body temperature, taking care that it does not exceed 110
  degrees. You will notice if you rub a little mixture between your
  thumb and forefinger that it does not feel granular. This is because
  the sugar begins to dissolve and forms a partial solution.
  
  Attach the bowl to the mixer, and with the whisk attachment, whip on
  medium speed (#5) until the mixture has cooled and increased
  considerably in volume (tripled or more), appears light in texture
  and almost white in color, and has thickened to the consistency of a
  whole egg meringue (about 3 to 4 minutes).  Pour in the vanilla
  during the final moments of whipping. Test if it is time to fold in
  the flour by lifting the whisk. If some of the mixture falls back
  into the bowl in ribbons and remains on the surface, proceed.  But if
  it sinks back into the batter right away, continue whipping for a few
  more minutes, or until the desired consistency is achieved. Then
  remove the bowl and its whisk from the mixer.
  
  With the aid of a flexible metal icing spatula, scoop up one third of
  the flour mixture, and sprinkle it over the top.  Using a rubber
  spatula, fold the mixture into the batter just until
  
  incorporated.  Repeat procedure two more times, folding just until
  all the flour has been absorbed.
  
  Gently pour about 1 cup of the batter into the melted butter, and
  with the rubber spatula, fold until combined.  Return the butter
  mixture to reserved batter, and again fold to combine.
  
  Gently pour the mixture into the pan, taking care not to deflate the
  foam structure you have created.  With a rubber spatula, smooth the
  top of the batter, working from the center outward, until a slightly
  raised ridge forms around the outside rim.  (Since the cake bakes
  faster near the metal rim, mounding the batter around the edges
  assures a more evenly baked layer.)  Bake for 25 to 27 minutes, or
  until the top springs back slightly when lightly touched, sounding
  spongy when tapped, and the sides begin to contract from the pan.
  Even an aroma similar to that of freshly scrambled eggs pervades your
  kitchen as an indicator.
  
  Place the cake on a rack to cool for 5 to 10 minutes.  With mitts,
  tilt and rotate the pan, and gently tap it on the counter to see if
  the cake is releasing from the metal sides.  If not, or if in doubt,
  run a small metal spatula or the thin blade of a table knife between
  the outside cake edge and the metal rim, freeing the sides and
  allowing air to get under the layer as it is rotated.  Cover the pan
  with another cooking rack, invert it onto that rack, and carefully
  lift the pan from the cake to remove. Slowly peel off the parchment
  liner, turn it over so that the sticky side faces up, and reposition
  it on top of the cake. Cover with the first rack, invert the layer
  right side up, and remove the top rack.  Allow cake to cool
  completely.
  
  If you plan to assemble a dessert later in the day or the next, leave
  the genoise out, uncovered, on a rack to airdry.  (Most genoises
  benefit from slight staling since they will absorb the dessert syrup
  more easily.) The theory behind using dessert syrup is twofold: It
  makes it possible to keep the dessert longer, and it adds to a
  complexity of flavors.) To use within 2 days, wrap the genoise in
  plastic wrap. To freeze it (for no more than 10 days), cover the
  plasticwrapped package in foil. To protect the cake's delicate
  structure, place the foilwrapped package in a sturdy container, such
  as a metal tin, before freezing.  Add a label, indicating the
  contents and date baked.
  
  Yield: one 8 x 1 3/4 inch round layer

           Cutting the Cake
 
  The genoise is cut in such a fashion that its exterior is left
  intact, but a core is removed Imagine a 1/2-inch thick border around
  the outside edge of the cake.  Now, using the tip of a shortbladed
  paring knife, cut along the imaginary line with a sawing motion
  around the entire cake, stopping short of the cake's bottom by
  1/2-inch. Loosen the 6 1/2 -inch circle or inner core the cake
  without disturbing the outer shell Using a small serrated knife such
  as a tomato knife, insert the blade into the side of the cake 1/2
  ~inch from the bottom, creating a small slit. Keeping the knife
  horizontal and level, pivot the serrated edge in one direction,
  trying not to cut through the outer shell of cake.  (This will
  eventually loosen the entire bottom of the inner core.)
  
  Remove the knife, insert it back into the slit with the serrated edge
  facing the opposite direction, and pivot the other way.  Repeat three
  more times, rotating the cake a quarter turn each time.  After
  completing four cuts, you should have loosened the core sufficiently
  to lift it out. Test it gently with a fork around the edge of the
  core; if you meet resistance anywhere, insert the serrated knife back
  into the nearest slit, and pivot the blade again.  Be patient and
  keep pivoting as well as tracing the top circle, and soon you'll be
  able to lift the core with the aid of the fork.
  
  Remove the center core of the cake; it should measure about 6 1/2 to 7
  inches in diameter and be about 1-inch thick.  Place the core on a
  flat work surface.  Mentally divide it in half horizontally.  Now,
  using the paring knife, cut all the way around the side of the cake
  about 1/2-inch deep on that imaginary line.  Slide a 12-inch knife
  into the cut. Holding the knife steady in that path, rotate the cake
  in a circle into the knife blade, cutting in a slow sawing motion all
  around, until the cake is evenly split into two 1/2-inch thick layers.
  
  Remove the top 1/2-inch layer, wrap it in plastic, and save for
  future use. Split the remaining 1/2- inch layer into two 1/4-inch
  thick layers, using the same cutting procedure as above.  Remove the
  top 1/4-inch layer and set aside.  (Use a removable quiche bottom to
  aid in lifting, if necessary.)

 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 c  Hard whole wheat flour, or
           More as necessary
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Warm water
           Optional toppings:
           Grated Parmesan
           Cayenne
           Coarse salt
           Sesame seeds
           Cumin seed
 
  You will need a food processor, several 10- by 14-inch baking sheets
  or pizza pans, a pizza cutter or a sharp knife, and a clean spray
  bottle.
  
  Place the flour and salt in a food processor and process for 10
  seconds to mix thoroughly. With the motor running, add the water in a
  steady stream, then process for 10 seconds longer. The dough should
  have formed into one large ball; if not, feel the dough: If it feels
  very sticky, add 3 to 4 tablespoons more flour and process briefly
  until a ball forms. If the dough feels dry and floury, start the
  processor again, add 2 to 3 tabespoons more water, and process until
  a ball of dough forms.
  
  Once you have a ball of dough, process for 1 minute more, no longer.
  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 30
  seconds or so. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.
  
  Preheat the oven to 500 degrees, and place two racks near the center
  of the oven.
  
  Divide the dough into 8 pieces. Work with one piece at a time,
  leaving the other pieces covered. On a lightly floured surface, with
  lightly floured hands, flatten a piece of dough with your palms. Then
  roll it out to a very thin rectangle or round, as even a thinness as
  possible to ensure even cooking. Gently lift the dough from your
  rollling surface and place it on a large baking sheet or pizza pan.
  Sprinkle on one of the optional toppings or leave plain. Using a
  knife or a pizza cutter, cut through the dough to make rectangular
  crackers. (Don=t worry if they are not all exactly the same size.
  Variations in size and flavor will make your crackers interesting.)
  Spray the dough lightly with water and place on the upper oven rack.
  
  Begin rolling out the next piece of dough, keeping an eye on the
  crackers already baking. (Crackers brown from underneath.) Check on
  them 2 1/2 to 3 minutes after they go in. As soon as the thinnest
  patches of the dough have started to brown, take them out. If
  necessary, continue baking, checking every 30 seconds, but it is
  better to take the crackers out a little early than too late.
  
  You will soon get a feel for timing and degree of doneness. Variables
  that affect timing are the heat of your oven and how thin you managed
  to roll out your dough. When they come out of the oven, some of the
  crackers will be crisp, while others will need a little time in the
  air to crisp up. Transfer to a large bowl, breaking up any
  incompletely separated crackers. Roll out the remaining dough,
  season, and bake. When completely cool, crackers can be stored in a
  well-sealed plastic bag or cookie tins for up to a month.
  
  Yield: Approximately 13 dozen very thin crackers of varying size,
  averaging 1 1/2 by 2 1/2 inches

  1 1/2 c  Boiling water
    3/4    To 1 cup all purpose flour
 
  Blue corn is one of many different varieties of corn grown by the
  Hopi and Pueblo Indians. It ranges in color from gray to blue to
  almost black, and is used in breads, dumplings, sauces, and in
  drinks. Blue corn tortillas are traditionally made without salt, as
  below, for salt is thought to mask the full but subtle taste of the
  blue corn.
  
  These tortillas are soft to eat, and not at all tough. Because they
  contain a little wheat flour, they are also relatively easy to
  handle; you can pat them out by hand, then roll them to an even
  thickness if need be. They are cooked quickly in a hot ungreased
  skillet, then wrapped in a towel to stay soft and warm until ready to
  be eaten.
  
  You will need a medium-sized bowl, a griddle or heavy skillet at
  least 8 inches in diameter, and a rolling pin.
  
  Place corn meal in a bowl and pour boiling water over. Stir to mix
  well. Let sit for fifteen minutes. Mix in one-half cup of all purpose
  flour. Turn this mixture out onto a bread board spread with 1/4 cup
  of flour. Knead for 2 to 3 minutes, incorporating the 1/4 cup of
  flour into the dough (and if necessary, use a little more). The dough
  will be soft but not at all strong. Return the dough to the bowl and
  cover. Let rest for 30 minutes.
  
  Divide the dough into eight pieces. Between well-floured palms, make
  flat round patties out of each of the eight and set aside. Heat your
  griddle over medium high heat, making sure that it is hot before you
  cook the first tortilla. On a well-floured surface (as the dough is
  quite sticky), carefully roll out a tortilla until it is
  approximately 7 to 8 inches in diameter. (We find it easiest to first
  pat out the dough with our fingers or between our palms, and then to
  roll out the tortilla at the very last just to make it uniform in
  thickness). Cook the tortilla as you would a wheat tortilla,
  approximately one minute on each side. The tortillas will be flecked
  with brown on both sides. When cooked, remove and wrap in a kitchen
  towel. Stack one on top of another.
  
  Yield: Makes eight blue corn tortillas approximately 8 inches in
  diameter.

      Title: Cooked Tomatillo Salsa With Arbol Chiles
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      3    4 large cloves garlic,
           Minced
      1 md White onion, finely chopped
      3    4 Arbol, chiles finely
           Chopped (approximately 1
           Tablespoon)
      1 lb Drained cooked or canned
           Tomatillos
      1 c  Chicken broth
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Fresh coriander leaves,
           Chopped
 
  You will need a large skillet or heavy saucepan and either a blender
  or food processor.
  
  Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet or saucepan over medium high
  heat. Add garlic and onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until
  onion is transparent. Add chiles and cook for one minute more. Add
  tomatillos, then pour in broth and add sugar and salt. Bring to a
  boil, lower heat and gently simmer uncovered for thirty minutes.
  Remove from heat and let cool. Taste for salt and adjust if
  necessary. You can either mash the tomatillos with a fork to produce
  a coarse-textured salsa, or transfer the sauce to a food processor or
  blender to be briefly processed to a smooth texture. Transfer sauce
  to a serving dish and just before serving, stir in coriander leaf.
  
  When tomatillos are in season they can be easily cooked by peeling
  off the paper-like covering, and then simply boiling the fruits in
  several inches of water until softened. We also freeze cooked
  tomatillos for use in the cold months. This salsa has great flavor
  and a little heat. It can be made with pre-cooked, frozen, and
  defrosted tomatillos, as well as canned or fresh cooked tomatillos.
  
  Yield: approximately 2 cups medium-hot green salsa.

      Title: Galette Des Rois Aux Amandes (The Three Kings Almond Tart
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      9 oz Flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      7 oz Unsalted butter
    1/4 pt Chilled water
           Icing sugar
           For the filling:
      4 oz Unsalted butter
      4 oz Caster sugar
      3    Egg yolks
      4 dr Almond essence
      3 tb Kirsch
      4 oz Freshly ground almonds
      1    Dried bean, gold ring or
           Baby figurine
 
  For the pastry, sift the flour and salt into a large bowl. Cut in 3
  ounces of butter with a sharp knife until the mixture resembles
  crumbs. Mix in enough water to make a non-sticky dough. Knead gently,
  cover and leave for
       20    minutes.
  
  Roll out the pastry on a floured board to about 1/4-inch thickness.
  Dot it with one-third of the remaining butter cut into dice. Fold the
  pastry into three, like a letter, then again into three in the
  opposite direction. Cover in a cloth and refrigerate for 20 minutes.
  Repeat this process twice more and leave for another 20 minutes
  chilling before using. If you can't face all that fun, buy 1 pound of
  puff pastry instead.
  
  Divide the pastry in half. Roll each half into a round of about 9 inch
  diameter and let rest while you make the filling.
  
  Cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Whisk in
  2 of the yolks, the almond essence, kirsch and the ground almonds.
  Work together until you have a smooth paste.
  
  Rinse a baking tray under cold water. Place one of the pastry rounds
  on the tray and spoon the paste onto it, leaving a 2-inch margin all
  around. Hide the bean or the other objects in the paste. Beat the
  remaining egg with a little water and paint the pastry margin. Place
  the second round of pastry on top and gently press edges together.
  Chill 45 minutes.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Using a sharp knife make a lattice or
  star-shaped pattern on the pastry surface, but do not cut through the
  filling. Pinch the edges prettily together. Paint the top with the egg
  wash. Bake the galette for 30 to 40 minutes until the pastry is crisp
  and brown. Transfer to a rack and cool. Dust with icing sugar.
  
  When cool, serve with a gold crown on top (made with your own fair
  hands) and a glass of kirsch or some pudding wine. Eat and discover
  who will be king of the feast, then crown them!

      Title: Gravlax
 Categories: Emeril
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Kosher salt
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh dill
      2 tb Grated orange zest
           Fresh ground black pepper
      3 tb Vodka
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1    (4 pound) side of fresh
           Salmon, pin bones removed
           And rinsed under cold
           Water
  1 1/2    Dozen fresh bagels
      1 lb Cream cheese
    1/4 c  Minced red onions
 
  In a mixing bowl, combine the salt, dill, zest, black pepper, vodka,
  and sugar together.  Place the salmon, skin side down, on several
  large sheets of plastic wrap.  Cover the entire salmon with the
  curing mixture, packing the cure into the salmon.  Wrap the salmon
  completely and tightly in the plastic wrap and place the salmon, skin
  side down on a 1/2 sheet pan. Place something heavy like a skillet,
  weights, or a brick (which needs to be wrapped in plastic wrap). This
  will help infuse the salmon into the mixture. Refrigerate the salmon
  for 24 hours. Remove the salmon from the refrigerator and wipe off
  the salt mixture.  Rinse the salmon under cold water, removing all
  the cure.  Using a sharp knife, slice the salmon diagonally paper
  thin.  Serve the Gravlax with the bagels, cream cheese and red onions.

      1    Stalk fresh lemongrass
      1 tb Light oil
      1    Jalapeno pepper, cored,
           Seeded, and finely diced (1
           Tablespoon)
      3    Cloves garlic, peeled,
           Bashed, and finely chopped
    1/3 c  Red bell pepper, cut into
    1/4    -inch dice
    1/2 c  Celery, cut into 1/4-inch
           Dice
      4 ts Grated gingerroot
      1 c  Chopped fresh pineapple
           (1/4-inch dice)
     12    Mint leaves, finely chopped
    1/4 c  Loosely packed cilantro
           Leaves, finely chopped
      1 tb Thai fish sauce or tamari
      1 ts Rice wine vinegar
      1 ts Toasted sesame oil
           For garnish:
      6    Sprigs fresh mint
      6    Sprigs cilantro
 
  In a medium saucepan, boil the rice in 4 cups of water for 25
  minutes, or until just tender.  Drain through a sieve and rinse with
  cold water to wash off the starch and cool the rice.  Spread the rice
  in a flat metal pan and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. This is
  a dish that cooks quite quickly from this point on, so it's important
  to have all the ingredients prepared and ready at hand. Remove the
  tough outside layer of the lemongrass and cut off the root end and
  the dry top. Start slicing from the root end and use only the most
  tender, bulb-like part of the stalk. Slice thinly and chop very fine
  so the flavor will be spread throughout. You should have about 1/4
  cup, chopped. Warm the oil in a large frying pan over medium-high
  heat.  Saute the lemongrass, chiles, and garlic for 30 seconds to
  release the aromatic oils. Add the red pepper, celery, and ginger and
  stir-fry for another 30 seconds. Add the chilled rice and cook until
  heated through, stirring occasionally to keep it form sticking. Add
  the pineapple, mint, and cilantro to the hot rice. Sprinkle the fish
  sauce, vinegar, and sesame oil over the top.  (Vegetarian Option:
  Substitute tamari for the fish sauce.)  Stir to mix and serve
  immediately.
  
  Garnish with sprigs of mint and cilantro.

    1/2 ts Coconut extract
      1 tb Thai fish sauce
 
  To prepare the chickens:
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Remove the tough outside layer of the lemongrass stalk and cut off
  the root end and the dry top.  Starting from the root end, cut the
  most tender, bulb-like part of the stalk into thin diagonal slices.
  Combine the lemongrass, ginger, and garlic and divide between the
  cavities of the two chickens.  Turn the chickens breast down on a
  plate so that the seasonings fall against the inside of the breasts.
  Insert a vertical poultry roaster into each chicken and stand
  upright. Tie the legs together with cotton string and tuck the wings
  behind the breast. Set the chickens in a 9 by 13-inch baking dish. If
  you don't have a vertical roaster, lay the chickens on a rack in a
  roasting pan. Tie the legs together with cotton string and tuck the
  wings behind the breast. Whichever roasting method you are using,
  pour 1 1/2 cups of warm water into the bottom of the baking dish.
  Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the
  chickens reach 140 degrees F in the thickest part of the thigh. (The
  chickens in the roasting pan may take an extra 10 minutes.)  Remove
  from the oven and set aside for 10 minutes.  The final internal
  temperature should be 160 degrees F. To prepare the sauce: Warm the
  oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Saute the onion and the
  India Ethmix until the onion is soft and translucent, about 5
  minutes. Stir in the ginger, garlic, and lemon grass, and cook for 3
  more minutes. Add the chicken stock and pineapple juice concentrate,
  stirring to incorporate. Cook for an additional 3 minutes. Strain the
  sauce through a sieve into a small saucepan using a puree press or
  the back of a spoon. Whisk together the yogurt cheese, coconut
  extract, and Thai fish sauce in a 2-cup glass measure. Pour a little
  of the hot pineapple sauce into the yogurt mixture and stir to warm
  the yogurt cheese. Add the tempered yogurt cheese to the sauce and
  whisk until smooth. Cover and set aside to keep warm. To assemble the
  dish: Remove the chickens from the roasting pan and pour the cooking
  juices into a fat strainer. Remove the vertical roasters if you were
  using them. Remove and discard the skin. Cut the legs and breast meat
  away from the carcasses. Put aside 1 leg and 1 breast for another
  meal. Slice the meat from the remaining breasts and legs and arrange
  on a warmed plate.  Cover and keep warm. Pour the de-fatted pan
  juices into a small saucepan and boil vigorously until the liquid is
  reduced to about 1/4 cup.  Allow to cool for a minute, then stir into
  the curry sauce.
  
  Arrange slices of chicken on a warmed plate and spoon curry sauce
  over the meat.

      Title: Yogurt Cheese
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Plain nonfat yogurt, no
           Gelatin added
 
  Put the yogurt in a strainer over a bowl.  Or you can use a coffee
  filter, piece of muslin, or a paper towel and place it in a small
  sieve over a bowl.  Cover and let it drain in the refrigerator for 12
  hours or overnight.  It becomes quite firm and the small lumps
  disappear, which makes it ideal for use in sauces.  The liquid whey
  drains into the bowl, leaving you with thick, creamy yogurt cheese.

      Title: Lychee Sorbet With Fruit Salsa
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  Water
      1 tb Grated fresh gingerroot
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 cn Lychees (20 ounces), drained
    1/2 c  The syrup reserved
           Fruit Salsa:
      1    Mango, peeled, seeded, and
           Finely chopped (about 3/4
           Cup)
    3/4 c  Peeled, cored, and finely
           Diced fresh pineapple
      6    Mint leaves, finely chopped
    3/4 ts Coarsely ground black
           Peppercorns
  1 1/2 c  Chopped, unsweetened
           Strawberries (fresh or
           Frozen)
 
  To prepare the sorbet: Combine the water, ginger, and sugar in a
  medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Remove from the
  heat and strain through a fine sieve with a puree press, discarding
  the ginger pulp. Process the lychees and 1/2 cup of their syrup in a
  blender or food processor until smooth, about 2 minutes.  Pour
  through a sieve set over the ginger water, again pressing with a
  puree press.  Discard the pulp. Freeze the lychee sauce in an ice
  cream freezer according to the manufacturer's directions.  If you do
  not have an ice cream machine, freeze the liquid in a shallow baking
  pan until it is almost solid. This will take an hour or two depending
  on your freezer. Once the sauce is frozen, remove it from the freezer
  and break into small pieces. Beat in the large bowl of an electric
  mixer until smooth. Return the mixture to the shallow pan and
  refreeze. Repeat the freezing and beating process until you are
  satisfied with the consistency of the sorbet.  The more times you
  beat, the smoother the texture will be, but it must be refrozen each
  time.  One short beating will produce a granita.  Several beatings
  will result in a richer, smoother texture. When you are satisfied
  with the texture, transfer the sorbet to a covered storage container
  and let it ripen in the freezer for at least 30 minutes before
  serving. To prepare the salsa: This salsa should be made as close to
  serving time as possible in order to be at its best. Toss the
  prepared mango, pineapple, mint, pepper, and strawberries in a small
  bowl and set aside until ready to serve.  If you are using frozen
  strawberries, chop and add them at the last minute, still partially
  frozen, so they don't become limp. To serve: Place a scoop of the
  sorbet on a chilled dessert plate.  Spoon 1/3 cup of the fruit salsa
  alongside and garnish with a crisp ginger cookie.

      2 c  Dried figs
    1/2 c  Orange juice
    1/4 c  Honey
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
           Walnut Linzer Dough:
  1 1/2 c  Flour
  1 1/2 c  Walnut pieces, finely ground
    2/3 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
    1/2 ts Cloves
      1 ts Baking powder
  1 1/2    Sticks butter
      1    Egg
      1    Egg yolk
      1 ts Grated orange zest
           Garnish:
           Confectioners' sugar
 
  Lightly butter a 10 by 2-inch deep layer pan.
  
  For the filling, stem and dice the figs and combine with remaining
  ingredients in a nonreactive saucepan.  Bring to a simmer and cook
  over low heat, stirring occasionally, until figs are soft and mixture
  is thickened. Stir often as the filling thickens to avoid scorching.
  Cool and puree in the food processor. Set a rack in the middle level
  of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. For the dough, combine dry
  ingredients in a mixing bowl. Rub in butter evenly, making sure
  mixture does not become pasty. Whisk egg, yolk and orange zest and
  stir in, continuing to stir until a soft dough forms.  Spread 2/3 the
  Linzer dough in the bottom of the prepared pan. Evenly spread the
  filling on the dough, keeping it about 1/2-inch from the edge.  Place
  the remaining dough in a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain
  tube.  Pipe 4 lines of the dough, spaced equidistant from each other,
  over the filling. Pipe 4 more lines diagonal to the first ones. With
  the remaining dough, pipe a series of small spheres around the edge.
  Bake the Linzer Torte for 45 minutes, until the center is firm when
  gently pressed with a fingertip.  Cool in the pan on a rack.  Unmold
  and dust lightly with confectioners' sugar immediately before serving.

  and fill to the top with ice water.  Put half the liquid in the
  bottom of a bowl. Turn the flour/butter mixture onto it and pour the
  remaining liquid evenly over the top.  Using a large rubber spatula,
  fold the mixture until it's evenly moistened.  Squeeze it; it should
  hold together. If not, sprinkle in a little more water and gently
  mix. Turn the mixture out on the table and quickly fraiser:  (Using
  the palm of your hand, push sections of the dough away from you
  against the table. Gather the dough together and fraiser any portions
  that were missed.) Form the mass into whatever shape you will be
  rolling out (i.e., disk for round, cylinder for rectangle), and wrap
  in plastic wrap.  Chill for at least 30 minutes or up to 3 days.
  Dough can be frozen for up to 3 months.

      Title: Cranberry Apple Tarte Tatin
 Categories: Baker
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Recipe Pate Sucree
      5 lg Apples (about 2 1/2 pounds)
           Juice of one lemon
      4 tb Butter
    3/4 c  Plus 1 tablespoon sugar
    1/3 c  Cranberries (optional)
 
  Make the dough.  Form into a 5-inch disk, wrap in plastic and chill
  one hour, or up to 3 days.  Remove the dough from the refrigerator
  and on a lightly floured surface, roll it to a 12-inch circle. Brush
  off any excess flour.  Place the round on a sheet tray lined with wax
  or parchment paper, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until
  ready to use. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Peel, core and slice each
  apple in half. Slice each half in 3 sections and toss the apples in
  lemon juice. Set aside. Melt the butter, sugar and 1/4 teaspoon lemon
  juice together in an ovenproof skillet measuring 10 inches across the
  top. (Bakelite handles are ovenproof.) Cook, stirring, until the
  mixture turns a light caramel color.  Be careful not to overcook; it
  will continue to darken from the residual heat in the pan. Remove
  from heat.  Arrange the apple slices, rounded side down, in a circle
  around the skillet and in the center. Scatter the cranberries between
  the slices.  You'll have enough slices to stack them 2 deep. Remove
  the dough from the refrigerator and center it over the skillet. Using
  scissors, trim the circle so that it overhangs 1/2-inch all around.
  Tuck the edge down between the apples and the skillet. Lightly brush
  the dough with cold water and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar.  Bake
  about 40 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown.  Remove from
  oven and let sit on a cooling rack for 5 minutes.  Place a serving
  dish over the skillet and flip the whole thing to invert the tart
  onto the plate.  (Don't forget to put a potholder over the skillet
  handle!)  Serve with ginger whipped cream.

      1 tb Unsalted butter
      2 tb Oil
      1 tb Fresh thyme, chopped
           Kosher salt
           Pepper
      3 md Onions (about 1 1/4 pounds),
           Thinly sliced
  1 1/4 lb Potatoes, peeled and diced
           In 1/2-inch cubes
      6 tb Parmesan cheese
           Egg wash (lightly beaten egg
           With 1 teaspoon milk)
 
  Make the pate Brisee and roll into a cylinder.  Chill for 1/2 hour or
  up to 3 days.
  
  Heat the butter and 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet.
  Season with salt, pepper and thyme and cook the onions over medium
  low heat until caramelized.  Remove the onions from skillet and set
  aside in a bowl to cool.  Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the
  skillet and saute the potatoes, seasoned with salt and pepper, until
  about 3/4 cooked. Combine the potatoes with the onions, mix in 1/4
  cup Parmesan and set aside to cool completely.  Preheat oven to 400
  degrees. Cut the cylinder of dough in half and refrigerate one half.
  Press the piece of dough into a rectangle and then roll it, on a
  lightly floured surface, into a rectangle measuring about 17 x 8
  inches. Brush off any excess flour and transfer the dough to an
  ungreased cookie sheet. Position it so that there is room for the
  second piece.  Refrigerate the tray while you roll out the second
  piece of dough in the same way and place it on the cookie sheet.
  Using a serrated pastry wheel, trim the edges of the rectangles to
  even them. Cut a "v" out of each corner to prevent the dough from
  bunching when it's folded. Spread half the potato/onion mixture on
  each, leaving a 1 1/2-inch border all around. Fold up the edges.
  Brush the dough with egg wash and sprinkle the remaining Parmesan
  over the dough and filling. Bake about 40 minutes, or until the crust
  is nicely browned.  Slice each section on the diagonal into about 6
  pieces.

 Categories: Baker
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2    Recipe pate sable
      4 oz High quality bittersweet
           Chocolate, chopped
    1/2 c  Creme fraiche
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
      3 tb Confectioner's sugar
      1 ts Pure vanilla extract
           Seeds from one vanilla bean
           (optional)
      2    To 4 cups soft juicy fruits
           (berries, fresh figs, grapes
           Sliced oranges,
           Nectarines, plums, peaches,
           Pineapples or mango)
 
  Make the dough, wrap in plastic wrap and chill for at least one hour
  or up to 3 days.  Remove from refrigerator and cut into small pieces.
  Reknead the dough into a 12-inch log.  Cut the log into even pieces;
  the size of the tartlet molds used will determine how many to cut.
  For 4 - inch tartlets you'll get 8 to 10 from one dough, for 3-inches
  about 12, and for miniature about 14 to 16. (For 65mm tartlet rings,
  cut the log into 12 to 16 pieces.) Lightly dust a piece of plastic
  wrap with flour.  Round a piece of dough and place it on the plastic
  wrap.  Cover the dough with another piece of plastic and press with
  the palm of your hand to flatten. Roll the piece out, flipping the
  whole thing once or twice, rolling on the other side to keep it even.
  Roll it out to a thickness of about 1/8-inch. It should be about
  3/4-inch larger than the mouth of the tartlet mold. Peel the dough
  off the plastic and center it over the mold. Using floured fingers,
  gently press the dough down to the bottom of the mold and against the
  sides, making it even as you go.  If the dough tears or is too thin
  in places, simply patch it with another small piece of dough.  (If
  using tart rings, rotate the mold on a lightly floured surface as you
  press the bottom and sides with lightly floured thumbs.  Be sure to
  press along the inside bottom to form a nice square bottom edge.)
  Place the saran over the top of the mold and press with your hand or
  a small rolling pin to cut any excess dough off the top.  (For rings,
  simply shave off the excess with a paring knife.)  Remove the plastic
  and, using lightly floured fingers, press the dough up around the
  sides so that it extends slightly above the rim of the mold.  Dock it
  a few times with a fork.  Place in the freezer. (Tart rings must be
  placed in the freezer on a sheet tray.)  Repeat with the remaining
  dough.  Scraps of dough can be chilled and reused. The tarts can be
  frozen in the molds for up to 5 days. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
  Place the tartlets on a sheet tray while they are still frozen and
  bake immediately. It will take 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the
  size. They're ready when the bottoms begin to color and the edges are
  lightly browned. Remove the molds from the sheet tray and cool
  completely on a rack.  (If using rings, slip the ring off and
  transfer the baked shell to the cooling rack with a metal spatula.)
  Tip the cooled shells out of the mold and onto your hand. If they
  won't come, gently insert the point of a small knife between the
  shell and the mold to release it.  Then invert it onto your hand.
  Melt the chocolate in a bowl over a pot of simmering water, or in a
  microwave, until it's about 3/4 melted.  Stir to melt completely.
  Using a dry pastry brush, brush the bottom and sides of each tart
  with the melted chocolate. Chill just until the chocolate sets. You
  probably won't use all the chocolate. Combine the creme fraiche,
  heavy cream, confectioner's sugar and vanillas in a bowl.  Whisk
  until soft peaks form.  Be careful not to get it too stiff.  Using a
  pastry bag fitted with #5 tip, pipe the cream in into the shells
  about 2/3 full.  Top with the fresh fruit and/or berries. (Figs and
  raspberries are a wonderful combination with the chocolate and creme
  fraiche.) The tartlets can be painted with chocolate as much as a day
  ahead and filled with the cream up to 4 hours ahead.  The fruit,
  however should be put on within an hour or so of serving.
  
  Yield: 8 to 16 tartlets, depending on size

  they are thicker. Cut off any excess dough with a rolling pin and
  press the sides up so it extends about 1/8-inch above the rim.  Dock
  the bottom with a fork and freeze. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Bake
  the frozen tart shell until the center barely begins to color, 10 to
  12 minutes.  Cool completely. Lower oven to 350 degrees. Combine the
  nuts and confectioner's sugar in a food processor and process to a
  fine powder, about 30 seconds. In the bowl of a mixer, cream the
  butter and sugar until fluffy.  Add the nut powder and mix
  thoroughly, scraping down the bowl once or twice.  Add the egg in
  three parts, beating after each addition on medium high speed, until
  very light and fluffy.  Add the almond and vanilla extracts.  On low
  speed, mix in the flour just until incorporated. Spread the jam on
  the bottom of the prebaked shell and then spread evenly with the
  frangipane.  Slice the pears in half and core.  Cut each half in very
  thin slices from blossom to stem, leaving them attached at the stem
  end. Cut off the end pieces and cut each half in quarters. Fan out
  each quarter and arrange the 6 fans in a circle over the frangipane,
  stems to the center. Be sure to leave some space between the fans so
  the filling can rise up around them. Brush the pears lightly with
  melted butter. Bake about 50 to 55 minutes, until the top is golden
  brown and crusty.  If the rim is getting too dark, cover the edge
  with foil or pie guards.  Cool in the mold on a rack; remove the
  outer ring after 10 minutes.  Slip a flexible metal palate knife
  between the tart and the metal bottom and slide off the tart. Cool
  completely on a rack before serving. Cut with a sharp serrated knife.

      Title: Pate A Choux Dough
 Categories: Baker
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      6 tb (3 ounces) unsalted butter
    3/4 c  Water
      1 c  All purpose flour
    1/8 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar
      4    Eggs
 
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  In 2 quart pot, combine the butter and
  water. On a piece of wax or parchment paper, sift together the flour,
  salt and sugar.  Bring the water and butter to a rolling boil, remove
  from heat and dump the flour mixture in all at once. Stir with a
  wooden spoon or paddle to incorporate. Return the saucepot to high
  heat and cook, stirring, for about one minute. The mixture will form
  a ball and coat the pan with a thin film. Transfer the mixture to a
  mixing bowl or standing mixer equipped with the paddle attachment.
  Mix the dough for a minute or so, on low speed, to release some of
  the heat.  Add the eggs, one at a time, completely incorporating each
  one before adding the next. Fit a pastry bag with a round #5 tip and
  fill with the warm dough. Line a heavy cookie sheet with parchment
  paper and anchor it to the tray with a little dab of the dough at
  each corner.  Pipe about forty to forty five 1 1/2-inch mounds about
  2 inches apart on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for
  10 to 15 minutes, until golden and puffed. Reduce heat to 350 degrees
  and bake for another 10 minutes or until they are golden brown and
  there are no droplets of moisture in the crevices.  Turn off oven and
  leave the choux to dry for another 10 minutes.  Use when cool, or
  freeze, wrapped in a plastic bag, for 2-3 months.
  
  Yield: 40 to 45 cream puffs

  and stir in the cornstarch. Pour about 1/3 of the hot milk into the
  egg mixture, whisking continuously to incorporate.  Whisk the
  tempered egg mixture back into the remaining hot milk, and place the
  pot back on the heat. Cook on medium high heat, stirring constantly
  but gently with the whisk, until the mixture comes to the boil.
  Reduce heat and let it boil for about 30 seconds, stirring
  constantly.  Remove from heat and gently whisk in the butter. Strain
  the pastry cream into a bowl, place plastic wrap right down on the
  surface, and chill completely. This can be made up to 3 days ahead.

      Title: Danish Dough
 Categories: Baker
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Envelope dry yeast
    3/4 c  Milk, warm (about 110
           Degrees )
      1    Egg, lightly beaten
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Vanilla extract
  2 1/2 c  All purpose flour
    1/2 lb (2 sticks) unsalted butter,
           Cold
 
  In a large bowl sprinkle the yeast over the milk.  Let sit for about 5
  minutes.  Add the egg, sugar, salt and vanilla.  Whisk gently to
  combine. Set aside. Quarter each stick of butter and cut into 9 or 10
  pieces. Toss the diced butter and flour together in a medium bowl.
  (Optional method) Put the flour in the bowl of a food processor. Cut
  each stick of butter into 1/4 inch slices and mix into the flour.
  Pulse machine 8 to 10 times, just to cut the pieces of butter into
  1/2 inch pieces. If there are any larger pieces, break them with your
  fingers. Add the flour and butter mixture to the wet ingredients and
  fold with a rubber spatula until the flour is completely moistened.
  Transfer the dough to a smaller bowl, cover with plastic wrap and
  refrigerate overnight. Remove the dough from the refrigerator.  On a
  heavily floured surface, pat it into a rectangle about 8 x 6 inches,
  and then roll it into a larger rectangle about 14 x 24 inches.  Brush
  off any excess flour and fold both edges in so that they meet in the
  center. If the dough is sticking underneath, release it with a long
  flexible metal palate knife. Dusting off any excess flour and fold
  the dough in half when the edges meet. This is called a "book or
  4-fold". Rotate the rectangle of dough 1/4 turn on the table.  This
  is called a "turn".  Roll into a rectangle measuring about 24 x 12
  inches, loosening the dough underneath with a the metal spatula,
  reflouring as necessary. Brush off any excess flour and give it
  another book fold. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for 20
  to 30 minutes. Remove the dough from the fridge and repeat this
  process two more times, rolling the dough out each time to 12 x 24
  inches.  There are 4 book folds in all. After the final turn, shape
  the package into a rectangle measuring about 9 x 6 inches. Brush off
  any excess flour, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for up to 2 days or
  freeze for up to one month. Yield: 2 pounds of dough

      Title: Chocolate Babka
 Categories: Baker
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2    Recipe danish dough (l
           Pound)
           Streusel:
      3 tb Flour
      3 tb Sugar
      1 tb Melted butter
           (approximately)
           Filling:
      3 oz Grated or finely chopped
           Semi-sweet chocolate
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 c  Streusel (approximately)
      2 tb Melted butter
           (approximately)
 
  Make streusel:  In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and sugar.
  Drizzle in the melted butter and mix with your fingertips until the
  mixture lumps into unevenly sized crumbs.  Refrigerate until ready to
  use. Combine the chocolate, sugar and cinnamon.  Brush a 8 x 4 x 2
  1/2 inch pan, or 5 cup loaf pan with melted butter.  Roll the dough
  into a rectangle measuring 9 x 22 inches and brush off any excess
  flour. Brush the dough generously with the melted butter, leaving a
  1/2 inch along the top edge of the dough. Sprinkle the chocolate
  mixture evenly over the dough, leaving the top 1/2 inch border free.
  Reserve 2 tablespoons of the mixture. Sprinkle the streusel over the
  chocolate, reserving about 3 tablespoons. Brush the 1/2 inch border
  along the top lightly with water. Beginning at the bottom edge, roll
  the dough into a log and pinch along the seam to seal it well.
  Moisten the ends of the log with water and bring them together to
  form a ring. Pinch the ends to seal. Gently twist the circle of dough
  twice into a double figure 8 and place in the prepared loaf pan,
  keeping the joint and seam down. Brush the top with melted butter.
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cover the pan with a towel and set in
  a warm draft free place to proof for about 1 1/4 hours, or until a
  finger gently pressed into the dough leaves an indentation.  It will
  not quite double, but will increase more than half again in size when
  fully proofed. Brush the top with more melted butter and sprinkle
  with the reserved chocolate/sugar and streusel.  Bake 45 to 50
  minutes, or until the dough in the crevices appears baked.  If the
  top browns too quickly, cover loosely with foil.  Cool on a rack, in
  the pan, for 15 minutes.  Slip a knife around the edge to loosen it
  and turn out onto the rack.  Cool before slicing.

      Title: Maryland Style Crabcakes
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Fresh jumbo lump crabmeat
      1    Sweet red pepper, seeded and
           Finely diced
      1    Sweet yellow pepper, seeded
           And finely diced
      1 tb Finely chopped fresh garlic
      1    To 2 jalapeno peppers,
           Finely chopped
    1/3 c  Fresh cilantro leaves,
           Chopped
    1/3 c  Mayonnaise
      1 c  Fresh white bread crumbs
      3 tb Maryland style "Old Bay"
           Brand seasoning powder
      1 ts Each of salt and freshly
           Ground black pepper
           Olive oil or vegetable oil
           For sauteing
 
  Even though crab meat is packaged fresh and clean of shell there are
  always some shell fragments remaining.  Open the crab meat, dump into
  a clean dish, and with scrupulously clean hands, pick through and
  clean the crabmeat of all shell fragments.  Be careful of the
  delicate nature of such a high quality product and try not to crumble
  the large lumps of crab. Mix the crabmeat with the sweet peppers,
  garlic, jalapeno, cilantro leaves, and mayonnaise.  Add the seasoning
  powder, 4 tablespoons of the bread crumbs, salt, and pepper. Mix well
  then refrigerate the mixture for twenty minutes. A cold mix is easier
  to work with and form into cakes.  Cover a work surface with waxed
  paper and sprinkle with half of the remaining bread crumbs.  Scoop up
  and divide the crabmeat into 6 equalsize portions and place each
  mound on the work space.  With the a portion of crab in the palm of
  one hand pat the crab with the fingers of your other hand into a
  diskshaped cake approximately 3/4-inch thick. It is important for the
  crab cakes to be the same thickness so that they will cook uniformly.
  Pat each cake with the bread crumbs, turning them so they coat evenly
  on all sides. Refrigerate for at least an hour so that the firm
  enough to cook and in this way prevent them from crumbling. Preheat
  the oven to 375 degrees. Not more than half an hour before you plan
  to serve the crab cakes add enough oil to cover the bottom of a saute
  pan.  Heat until just before it begins to smoke.  Add the crab cakes
  gently, being careful not to crowd the pan. (Cook them in two batches
  if necessary.) Turn the cakes and brown the second side.  When the
  crab cakes are well browned to a rich golden on both sides, place on
  a heat proof platter and into a 375 degree oven for 6 to 8 minutes to
  ensure that they are fully cooked and hot at the center. Serve with
  chili mayonnaise and a mango salad.
  
  Yield: 6 to 8 crabcakes, 4 to 6 appetizer portions or 4 main course
  portions.

      Title: Salmon And Sea Scallop Sausage Black Bean Vinaigrette
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Fresh salmon fillet, all
           Skin and bones removed
      1 lb Sea scallops
      4    Egg whites
      1 tb Warm honey
      2 tb Grated ginger
      2 ts Asian five spice powder
      2 tb Thai fish sauce
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Ground white pepper
      1 c  Heavy cream
    1/2 c  Finely chopped scallions
 
  Divide the salmon into 2 pieces.  Cut one piece into a 1/4-inch
  square dice and set aside and refrigerate.  Take half of the scallops
  and cut them into 1/4-inch size pieces that resemble the way you cut
  the salmon and set aside, refrigerated.  Place the remaining salmon
  and scallops into the bowl of a food processor along with the egg
  whites, honey, ginger, five spice, fish sauce, salt and pepper.
  Process by pulsing until a smooth puree is achieved.  Turn off the
  processor, scarp down the inside of the processor bowl, return the
  cover to the bowl and pulse quickly 10 seconds. Add 1/4 cup of cream
  and process 10 seconds more. Transfer the fish puree to a cold mixing
  bowl set over ice and refrigerate. Whip the remaining cream until
  soft peaks are formed. In a large bowl, combine the fish puree,
  reserved salmon and scallop dice and the scallions. carefully fold in
  the whipped cream trying not to deflate the cream to much. When all
  of the ingredients are folded together refrigerate for at least one
  hour. Cut plastic wrap into roughly 8 by 8-inch squares.  Place 1/2
  cup of the fish mousse into the lower third of a piece of plastic
  wrap and fold the edge of the plastic nearest you over to encase the
  mousse.  Fold the two ends in to further enclose the mousse and roll
  the tube of fish mousse as you would a cigar. This is should be a
  sausage shape about 1 1/2 inches in diameter and about 4 inches long.
  Continue to roll sea food sausage in this way until all of the mixed
  is used. To cook the sausage, heat water in the bottom portion of a
  steamer pot. Place the plastic wrapped sausage in the steamer insert
  or an Asian steamer basket and set over boiling water. Cook for
  approximately 10 to 12 minutes or until fully cooked.  Test for
  doneness by piercing the center with a skewer.  It should come out
  clean when cooked. Serve by carefully unwrapping the sausage and
  DISCARDING THE PLASTIC WRAP prior to eating!
  
  Serve on a bed of black bean vinaigrette.
  
  Yield: 8 to 4-ounce sausages. 4 main course or 8 appetizer portions.

      2 c  All purpose flour
      3    Whole eggs
    1/2 c  Milk
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      2 c  Bread crumbs
      1 c  Pecans, finely chopped
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Black pepper
    1/4 c  Parmesan cheese
  1 1/2 lb Boneless, skinless, chicken
           Breast
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil for frying
           (more if necessary)
      4 oz Unsalted butter
      2 tb Ancho chili paste
      1 tb Toasted and ground cumin
           Seed
           Several parsley sprigs,
           Leaves only
           Several cilantro sprigs,
           Leaves only
      1 tb Lime juice
    1/2 ts Ground black pepper
 
  For the breading process:  Three separate containers (preferably flat
  and wide baking dishes or gratin dishes) will be needed; one for the
  flour, one for wet ingredients and one for the breading ingredients.
  Place the flour into its chosen dish.  Whisk the eggs together with
  the milk and 2 tablespoons oil.  Combine the bread crumbs, pecans,
  salt, pepper and Parmesan cheese until uniformly mixed. Using a meat
  tenderizer or other flat object to pound the chicken breasts to a
  flat and uniformly 1/4-inch thick cutlet.  Dip the cutlets, one at a
  time into the flour first, next the egg mixture and finally the dry
  breading mix. Try to keep one hand dry and work one hand wet or use
  tongs to transfer the chicken from one dish to another.  When all of
  the chicken has been coated, place on a dish and refrigerate until
  ready to cook.  This may be done in advance. Make the flavored butter
  by placing the butter, chili paste, cumin seed, parsley, cilantro,
  lime juice and ground black pepper in the bowl of a food processor.
  Pulse to combine well and remove. Lay a piece of waxed paper 12 by 16
  inches out flat and scrape the flavored butter onto the waxed paper,
  at about 1/3 the length up, into a sausage shape. Roll the edge of
  the paper over the butter and enclose the butter to form a tubeshape.
  Roll the remaining paper up as you would a cigar and place this log
  of butter into the freezer for at least 3 hours until it is brick
  hard.  This butter may be made well in advance and keeps, frozen, for
  up to 1 month. To cook the chicken, heat a large saute pan over
  medium heat, with the 1/4 cup of oil until hot.  Add the chicken to
  the oil, cooking in batches to avoid over crowding the pan, and cook
  until golden brown about 6 minutes. Turn the chicken over and cook
  the second side for an additional 6 minutes until the center is
  cooked and the juices run clear. Transfer to a platter and keep warm.
  Remove the butter from the freezer, unwrap, and cut into 1/4-inch
  thick round slices.  After all the chicken has cooked, place 1 or 2
  slices of butter on each piece of chicken, allowing the heat from the
  chicken to melt the butter into the chicken coating.
  
  Serve with lemonsteamed asparagus and herb scented rice.

      1 c  Flour
      3    Eggs
    1/4 c  Milk
      2 tb Pure olive oil plus 1/3 cup
           For sauteing
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Ground black pepper
  1 1/2 c  Bread crumbs
    1/4 c  Chopped Italian parsley
    1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
      1 lg Beefsteak tomato, about 3/4
           To 1 pound, seeds removed
           And cut into
    1/2    -inch dice
      8    To 10 basil leaves, hand

      3 tb Fresh lemon juice
    1/2 c  Extra virgin olive oil
           Salt and fresh ground black
           Pepper to taste
 
  Pound the veal (or have the butcher do this ahead of time) to a
  1/4-inch thin and broad cutlet, leaving the bone still attached. Set
  aside while you prepare the breading setup.  Put the flour on a dish
  large enough to dredge the veal on.  Combine the eggs, milk, 2
  tablespoons olive oil and salt and pepper in a large bowl or dish
  with sides high enough to hold the liquid and veal chops.  Next,
  combine the bread crumbs, parsley and Parmesan cheese in a large flat
  casserole so that the process of breading may be kept neat and tidy.
  Make the tomato vinaigrette by combining the diced tomato with the
  shredded basil leaves in a bowl. Stir in the lemon juice, whisk in
  the oil and season with salt and pepper.  Set aside.  Heat the 1/3
  cup olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat.  Cook the veal
  cutlets one at a time, or if they are small enough and your pan is
  large enough, two at a time.  As you saute the veal, brown one side
  and keep the veal warm in a 250 degree oven while the rest are
  cooked. Serve the veal with a generous spoonful of the Tomato Basil
  Vinaigrette over the top.

           Salt and pepper to taste
      2 tb Dry thyme
      1 tb Dry rosemary
      2 tb Olive oil
      4 lg Vidalia onions (or other
           Sweets), peeled and sliced
           About 4 cups
      1 c  Dry red wine
      3    Carrots, thinly sliced,
           About 1 cup
      2 tb Chopped garlic
      2 c  Hot beef stock lightened
           With 1 cup water added
      2    Celery stalks tied with
           3 bay leaves into a
           Bouquet garni
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
  
  Season the beef brisket well with salt and pepper.  Crush the thyme
  and rosemary together with a mortar and pestle and rub the herb mix
  into the beef, coating it evenly.  Rub the beef well with 1
  tablespoon of the olive oil.  Heat a large saute pan with 1
  tablespoon olive oil over medium high heat for 2 to 3 minutes until
  the pan is nearly smoking. Add the beef to the hot pan and sear well
  on one side until browned before turning the beef over and searing
  the other side. When the beef has been well browned on both sides,
  remove from the pan and set aside. Add the onions to the saute pan
  and cook them until golden brown.  Add the red wine to the onions and
  reduce by half.  Pour the onions into a large heavy roasting pan and
  spread evenly across the bottom before putting the beef on the bed of
  onions. Add the carrots, garlic, hot beef/water and celery bundle to
  the beef in the roasting pan and place, uncovered, into the oven. All
  the combined liquid should rise only 2/3 as high as the meat is
  thick. Add additional water to maintain the braising liquid height.
  Cook for 1 hour before turning the beef over. Cook the second side
  uncovered for 1 hour before covering the pan with a cover or foil and
  turning the oven down to 325 degrees. Continue to slowly braise the
  beef brisket for 1 1/2 to 2 additional hours. Remove the pan from the
  oven, discard the celery bouquet and allow the beef to rest for 20
  minutes before slicing and serving with some of the onion jus.

           Yield about 4 cups
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
    1/2 c  Freshly grated Pecorino
           Cheese
 
  Green pasta recipe: Substitute steamed nettles for steamed spinach,
  or add 1/2 cup dried nettles and increase egg by 1. Make a mound of
  the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board. Make a well
  in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, oil and spinach.  Using
  a fork, beat together the eggs, oil and spinach and begin to
  incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well.  As
  you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well
  shape.  Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy.  The dough
  will come together when 1/2 of the flour is incorporated. Start
  kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands
  primarily. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the
  board and scrape up any left over crusty bits. Lightly flour the
  board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes.  The dough should be
  elastic and a little sticky.  Continue to knead for another 3
  minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary.  Wrap the
  dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room
  temperature.  Note: do not skip the kneading or resting portion of
  this recipe, they are essential for a light pasta. For the sausage:
  Heat 6 quarts water to boiling in a spaghetti pot and add 2
  tablespoons salt.  In a 10-inch to 12-inch sauté pan, cook sausage
  over low heat until fat begins to render, about 6 minutes.  Turn heat
  up to medium and cook until most of fat from sausage has rendered out
  and sausage is golden brown.  Add kale and chicken stock and cook
  until very soft, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper
  and remove from heat.
  
  Drop pasta into boiling water and cook until tender (about 1 minute).
  Drain pasta and toss into sauté pan with kale and sausage. Cook over
  high heat until coated, about 1 minute. Add grated cheese and toss to
  mix. Pour into heated serving bowl and serve.

           Liqueur, or dark rum
           (optional)
      1 lb Tempered chocolate for
           Dipping
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Bring large pot of water to the boil
  and add the baking soda.  Drop in the hazelnuts, bring back to a
  boil, and blanch 10 seconds.  Drain hazelnuts in a colander, then
  spread out on a baking sheet in a single layer.  Place in oven and
  roast 8 to 10 minutes until light brown.  Remove from oven, place a
  kitchen towel over the pan, and allow to cool completely.  Rub cooled
  hazelnuts between your palms; the skins should slip right off. Set
  aside 50 whole hazelnuts. Grind the rest very fine in a food
  processor fitted with the metal blade and set aside. Place sugar and
  heavy cream in a medium pot and bring to a boil. Add the chopped
  chocolate, let sit for 2 minutes, then whisk until smooth. Whisk in
  the butter.  Pour the ganache into the bowl of an electric mixer and
  allow to cool until set.  Fit the machine with a paddle and beat the
  set ganache on medium speed until aerated and fluffy, about 2
  minutes. Beat in the reserved ground hazelnuts and the liqueur if
  using. Beat well to thoroughly combine.  Load mixture into a pastry
  bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip. Line a baking sheet with
  parchment or waxed paper. Pipe out 1/2-inch balls. On top of each
  ball, press in one of the reserved whole toasted hazelnuts until it
  is halfway buried.  Place pan in refrigerator to chill completely. To
  coat, place tempered chocolate in a medium bowl. Line 2 baking sheets
  with parchment or waxed paper.  Get yourself 2 forks. Place one
  nuttopped ball on the prongs of one fork, nut up. Lower the fork into
  the melted chocolate, covering completely. Lift fork up, pause 3
  seconds to allow excess chocolate to drip off, then run bottom of
  fork along top of bowl to remove excess chocolate. Place fork on
  paperlined pan and use second fork to push off the candy while you
  withdraw the first fork (it's easier than it sounds).  Keep the nut
  up at all times.  Repeat with remaining centers. If it's warm out,
  place the finished candies in the refrigerator to set; otherwise they
  will set at cool room temperature (65 degrees). Yield: about 50 Both
  of these candies make great Christmas presents packed into little
  boxes or baskets. They are involved but can be done easily in large
  batches.  One day of work can yield many gifts. You can make a double
  of triple batch of truffle ganache and divide it, beating different
  flavorings into different parts.

      Title: Crumbly Sweet Pastry (Pate Sablee) With Almonds
 Categories: Toohot
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8 tb (1 stick) unsalted butter,
           Softened
      1 c  Plus 6 tablespoons
           Confectioner's sugar, sifted
      1    Egg
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/4 c  Allpurpose flour
    1/2 c  Ground almonds
 
  In an electric mixer, cream together butter and sugar until light and
  fluffy.  Add egg and salt and beat until combined.  Stir together
  flour and almonds and add to butter mixture.  Slowly mix just until
  flour is evenly moistened.  Do not let it form a ball. Remove dough
  from bowl onto a lightly floured work surface and form into 2 balls.
  Flatten each ball into a disk, wrap well, and refrigerate a minimum
  of four hours or as long as 4 days .
  
  Yield: 2 9 to 10 inch tart shells
  
  These two different pastry doughs have very different textures.  The
  first is flaky due to the incorporation of butter in small pieces: as
  the dough cooks, the butter melts and the water in it turns to steam
  and puffs up the dough.  The second dough is tender and crumbly: the
  butter is well creamed as for a cookie; the confectioner's sugar adds
  tenderness due to the cornstarch it contains; the ground almonds,
  which can be substituted for some of the flour in any pastry dough
  recipe, add an interesting graininess.

    1/2 c  Raisins
    1/4 c  Rum
      4    Granny Smith or other firm
           Tart apples
      4 tb Unsalted butter
    1/4 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/8 ts Cloves
    1/2 ts Allspice
      1 tb Lime juice
      1    Egg, beaten
      1 tb Light brown sugar
 
  Remove dough from refrigerator onto a lightly floured work surface.
  Divide into four equal portions.  Shape each into a ball, then
  flatten to form disks.  Roll one disk out to a rough 6 inch circle by
  rolling out from center, lifting and turning dough, and occasionally
  flipping to prevent sticking.  Flour board as necessary. Place on
  cookie sheet lined with parchment or plastic wrap and place another
  sheet of parchment or wrap on top.  Roll out second ball of dough in
  same manner. Repeat with remaining dough. Refrigerate at least 30
  minutes, or until ready to assemble tarts. Preheat oven to 425
  degrees.  Combine rum and raisins in a small saucepan and heat over
  low medium flame until rum simmers.  Turn off heat and let steep
  while you prepare the apples.  Peel the apples, cut them in half, and
  core them.  Cut each half into six even wedges. In a large skillet,
  melt the butter over medium high heat. When it has stopped foaming,
  add the apples and toss well.  Sprinkle sugar, cinnamon, cloves and
  allspice over the apples and toss. Lower heat to medium and continue
  to sautJ 1015 minutes until apples are lightly browned. Add steeped
  raisins with any remaining rum, along with the lime juice, and cook
  until liquids have evaporated. Remove from the heat and let cool.
  Take dough circles out of refrigerator and place before you on the
  board.  Brush each lightly with beaten egg.  Arrange 12 apple wedges
  on center of each dough round in a pinwheel pattern., leaving a 1
  inch border all around. Spoon remaining raisins over the apples.
  Fold edges of dough up over apples, in overlapping fashion.  Brush
  dough with egg wash and sprinkle apples with brown sugar.  Bake until
  golden brown, about 20 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

      Title: Baked Pineapple
 Categories: Toohot
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Ripe pineapple
      1    Lime, cut into quarters
  1 1/2 ts Cayenne pepper, or to taste
      1 tb Finely chopped parsley
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Cut off the very top of the
  pineapple and discard.  Place pineapple in a roasting pan.  Roast the
  whole pineapple for about 1 hour, then remove from the oven and, as
  soon as it is cool enough to handle, cut it first into 8 thick
  rounds, crosswise. Cut these slices in half and arrange on a patter.
  Squeeze the lime juice over the pineapple, dust with cayenne pepper,
  and sprinkle with a little chopped parsley. (Pineapple will dry out
  if it is not roasted whole.  Diners should pick up the halfrounds of
  pineapple with their hands and nibble the tender flesh from the
  inside of the rind.)

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 tb Sweet paprika
      1 tb Old Bay seasoning
  1 1/2 ts Chili powder*
  1 1/2 ts Granulated brown sugar
  1 1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    3/4 ts Garlic powder
    3/4 ts Onion powder
           Slab of spare ribs, 2 1/2 to
      3    Pounds
      4 c  Wood chips (hickory,
           Mesquite, etc.)
      1 tb White vinegar
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  Mix together the paprika, Old Bay seasoning, chili powder, sugar,
  black pepper, garlic powder and onion powder in a bowl. Rub half the
  mixture all over the slab of spare ribs, on every side. Reserve the
  other half of the dry rub mix.
  
  Heat the oven to 215 degrees. While the oven is warming, soak the wood
  chips in cold water to cover (for about 20 minutes).
  
  Remove the chips from water and spread them evenly in the base of the
  smoker. Place the smoker, uncovered, on top of two stove-top burners
  set at medium-high heat. Let the wood chips smoke for about 3
  minutes. Then place the slab of ribs on the smoker tray, place the
  tray over the wood chips, and cover the smoker tightly with its lid.
  Turn heat down to medium, and leave the smoker on the burners for 5
  minutes. Then transfer smoker to the oven, placing it on the oven
  floor.
  
  After the ribs have been in the oven for 1 1/2 hours, remove the
  smoker and once again place it over two burners set at medium heat
  for 5 minutes. Return smoker to oven floor.
  
  After the ribs have been in the oven for one hour more, remove the
  smoker from the oven. Carefully lift up the tray holding the ribs,
  and pour off the liquid that has accumulated in the tray. Reserve.
  Return tray with ribs to middle portion of oven, and cook for one
  hour more.
  
  While ribs are cooking, de-grease the reserved cooking liquid, and
  measure 2 tablespoons of it into a bowl. If you don't have 2
  tablespoons make up the difference with water. Add the vinegar and
  blend well. Reserve. Add the salt to the remaining dry rub mix and
  blend well. Reserve.
  
  Remove ribs from oven and brush top side with the cooking
  liquid-vinegar mixture. Then sprinkle the salted dry rub mix evenly
  over the top side of the ribs. Return to middle portion of oven, and
  cook one hour more.
  
  Remove ribs from oven. Let stand 15 minutes. Carve into individual
  ribs and serve.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Skinless, boneless chicken
           Breast halves, tenderloins
           Removed
      3 tb Green or black olive paste
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      3    (12 ounces) new potatoes,
           Washed
      2    Ripe tomatoes
           Salt and freshly ground
           Black pepper
      4 sm Tomatoes, washed and cored
           And sliced
 
  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Rub the olive paste on both sides of
  each chicken breast half.
  
  Cut the potatoes into 1/16th-inch slices and thinly slice the
  tomatoes. Set 4 12-inch squares of foil on the counter. Lightly oil
  the center of each piece of foil and spread some potato slices in the
  middle; season them with salt and pepper. Cover the potatoes with a
  chicken breast half, then cover with more potato slices, salt and
  pepper and the tomato slices. Wrap the chicken airtight, in a deli
  sandwich wrap, and set the packages on a baking sheet. Bake for 30
  minutes.
  
  When the chicken is done unwrap the packages carefully (be careful the
  steam which will escape when you open the packages does not burn your
  hands.) Transfer the chicken, potatoes, tomatoes and the natural
  juices to deep plates.
  
  Variations: Instead of the potatoes spread 1/2 cup drained canned
  white beans, a couple of slivers of fresh garlic, a leaf or two of
  fresh sage and a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil underneath the
  chicken. Top the chicken with the tomatoes. Or spread each chicken
  breast half with 1 teaspoon each of oriental sesame oil, soy sauce
  and rice vinegar. Top each chicken breast half with 1/2 cup sliced
  jicama; 1 cup raw fresh spinach and 1 sliced scallion. Open and
  garnish with sesame seeds. Or, instead of the green olive paste and
  tomatoes, season each chicken breast half with barbecue sauce or
  ketchup and top with 1/2 cup of frozen corn kernels; leave the
  potatoes in (especially good for kids)

      Title: Chocolate Mascarpone Cream: Tiramisu Part 2
 Categories: Baker
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     21 oz Mascarpone cheese
     11    L/2 ounces milk chocolate,
           Cut into small pieces
      8    Eggs, separated
           L/2 cup granulated sugar
      2 tb Kahlua
      2 tb Rum
           Unsweetened cocoa, sifted,
           For decoration
           About l/4 cup coarsely
           Grated milk chocolate, for
           Garnish
 
  In the large bowl of an electric mixer, using paddle or beaters, beat
  the mascarpone until fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl and
  under the beaters as necessary.
  
  Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, set over simmering water, melt the
  chocolate. Set aside.
  
  In a large heatproof bowl, set over simmering water, whisk the egg
  yolks with l/4 cup sugar until sugar dissolved and mixture is hot to
  the touch. Remove from heat and scrape into the mascarpone. On medium
  speed, beat just until combined. Lower speed, add the melted
  chocolate, and mix well.
  
  In a large bowl of the electric mixer, using the whip attachment,
  whip the egg whites to soft peaks. Add the remaining l/4 cup sugar
  and continue to beat until shiny and firm but not stiff. Fold into
  the mascarpone mixture. Stir in the Kahlua and rum. Refrigerate until
  needed.
  
  For the Soaking Liquid
  
  4 cups espresso coffee, decaffeinated or regular l l/4 cups water l
  cup sugar 3 tablespoons Kahlua 3 tablespoons rum
  
  In a small pot, combine all of the ingredients, bring to a boil.
  Remove from the heat and let cool.
  
  To assemble the Tiramisu:
  
  I like to use parfait or Pilsner glasses for this dessert. Place all
  of the glasses on a flat work surface. Cut out cake circles that will
  fit into the size glass your using. Using a ladle, place a small
  amount of Mascarpone cream in the glass, dip a cake circle in the
  soaking liquid (squeeze out any excess) and place on top of the
  cream. Ladle more cream on top of the circle, place another soaked
  circle of cake and finish with a layer of cream. Repeat this with all
  of the glasses. Refrigerate for about an hour or until set. Decorate
  with grated milk chocolate and sifted cocoa.

 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/4 c  All-purpose bleached flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Baking powder
      8 tb Cold unsalted butter
      2    To 3 tablespoons cold water
 
  To mix dough by hand, combine flour, salt and baking powder in a
  medium mixing bowl and stir well to mix. Cut butter into 1 tablespoon
  pieces and add to dry ingredients. Toss once or twice to coat pieces
  of butter. Using your hands or a pastry blender, rub the butter into
  the dry ingredients by breaking it into tiny pieces, continuously
  pinching and squeezing it into the dry ingredients. Be careful to
  keep the mixture uniform by occasionally reaching down to the bottom
  of the bowl and mixing all the ingredients evenly together. Continue
  rubbing the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture
  resembles a coarse ground cornmeal and no large pieces of butter
  remain visible. Scatter the smaller amount of water on the butter and
  flour mixture and stir gently with a fork -- the dough should begin
  holding together. If the mixture still appears dry and crumbly, add
  the remaining water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until the dough holds
  together easily.
  
  To mix the dough in the food processor, combine flour, salt and baking
  powder in work bowl fitted with metal blade. Pulse 3 times at 1-second
  intervals to mix. Cut butter into 1-tablespoon pieces and add to work
  bowl. Process, pulsing repeatedly at 1-second intervals, until the
  mixture is fine and powdery, resembles a coarse ground cornmeal and
  no large pieces of butter remain visible, about 15 pulses in all.
  Scatter the smaller amount of water on the butter and flour mixture
  and pulse 5 or 6 times -the dough should begin holding together. If
  the mixture still appears dry and crumbly, add the remaining water, 1
  teaspoon at a time, until the dough holds together easily.
  
  Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured surface and form it into a
  disk. Sandwich the disk of dough between two pieces of plastic wrap
  and press it into a 6-inch disk. Refrigerate the dough until firm, or
  until you are ready to use it, at least 1 hour.

      Title: Apple Dumplings
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           		   Baked Apples:
      6 sm Rome Beauty, Granny Smith or
           Golden Delicious apples
    1/2 sm Lemon
    1/2 c  Light brown sugar
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
      3    Tablespoons, about 1-ounce,
           Dark or golden raisins or
           Currants
      2 tb Unsalted butter
    1/3 c  Apricot preserves
    1/3 c  Water
    2/3    Batch Quickest Puff Pastry,
           Recipe follows
           Egg Wash:
      1    Egg beaten well with a pinch
           Salt
 
  To make the baked apples, set a rack at the middle level of the oven
  and preheat to 350 degrees. Peel and core the apples, leaving them
  whole. Rub them all over with the lemon, then place them in the
  baking pan. Sprinkle them with the sugar and cinnamon, making sure
  that some gets into the hollow centers. Stuff the raisins or currants
  into the centers then place a small slice of the butter on each apple.
  
  Bring the preserves and water to a boil in a small pan. Pour around
  the apples in the pan, then immediately place the pan in the oven.
  After about 10 minutes, baste the apples every 5 minutes with their
  juices. The apples should take about 30 minutes to bake. They should
  be tender but not disintegrating.
  
  Remove the pan from the oven and place it on a rack to cool. Baste the
  apples with the juices in the pan frequently while they are cooling,
  then cover and refrigerate the apples until they are thoroughly cold,
  about 2 to 3 hours. The apples may be prepared up to 2 days before
  forming and baking the pastries.
  
  To form the pastries, remove the apples from the pan and place them
  on a rack over the pan to drain. (Reserve any leftover juices to make
  a sauce.) Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to
  375 degrees.
  
  Place the dough on a floured surface and lightly flour the dough.
  Roll the dough out into a 10 by 18-inch rectangle. Cut the dough into
  six 5-inch squares and place them on the prepared pan. Use a small,
  round, fluted cutter to cut the remaining scrap of dough into 6 small
  circles.
  
  Brush the squares of dough lightly with egg wash. Place an apple in
  the center of each square. (Replace any raisins or currants that
  might have fallen out of the centers.) Bring each corner of the dough
  up to the top center of the apple. Pinch the seams of the pastry
  together, then carefully brush the outside with the egg wash. Place
  one of the fluted pastry circles on top of each pastry, where the
  corners join together. Brush the fluted dough with egg wash. Bake the
  pastries about 20 to 25 minutes, until deep golden and baked through.
  Place the pan on a rack to cool slightly before you serve the apples.

      Title: Chicken Paillard With Chive And Mustard Sauce Diane
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    6 ounce chicken breasts,
           Butterflied and pounded with
           Meat tenderizer
           To 1/4inch thick
           Salt and freshly ground
           Black pepper to taste
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      3 tb Chopped shallots
      2 oz Fine brandy
    1/4 c  White wine
      1 tb Dijon mustard
    3/4 c  Veal stock
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
      3 tb Chopped fresh chives
 
  Since each pounded, flattened chicken should have a large
  circumference, it will be necessary to cook the four breasts one at a
  time, setting each aside on a warm platter as you finish those that
  remain or use two pans to cook two simultaneously.
  
  Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat a large, heavy skillet
  over medium heat. Add 1/2 tablespoon of butter to the hot pan and
  heat the butter until it begins to foam. Add the first
  
  breast and sear, cooking for 3 to 4 minutes on a side before turning
  it over and allowing another 4 minutes on the second side. Remove the
  chicken from the pan and place on a warm platter. Repeat for the
  remaining chicken breasts, adding butter to the pan and sauteeing
  both sides. After all the chicken has been cooked and removed from
  the pan, add the shallots and cook two minutes until translucent.
  Lower the heat, move the pan away, and cautiously add the brandy.
  Being careful not to flame the brandy, return the pan to the stove,
  and over low heat, allow it to cook off. Add the white wine to the
  pan, raise the heat, and bring quickly to the boil. Stir in the
  mustard. Allow this to cook for 1 minute before adding the veal
  stock. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes more. Add the cream. Bring just to the
  boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the chives.
  
  Place the ovenproof platter of chicken breasts in a preheated 350
  degree oven for 1 to 2 minutes to reheat them very quickly before
  placing them on individual dishes and topping with some of the Diane
  Sauce. Serve with garlic mashed potatoes.

  high heat until the wine is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Stir in
  beef stock, glace de viande and bouquet garni. Stir well and season
  with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium low, cover and simmer
  until chicken is tender, 15 to 20 minutes, skimming surface to remove
  fat.
  
  Transfer chicken to a serving dish or individual plates and pour the
  sauce over the top. Sprinkle with parsley and serve with a rice pilaf
  and warm French bread.

      Title: Basic Pate A Choux
 Categories: Hot
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Water or milk
    1/2 c  Butter (4 tablespoons)
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Sugar if making a sweet
           Pastry
      1 c  Flour
      4    Eggs (1 cup)
 
  Place liquid, butter, salt and sugar, if using, in a medium saucepan
  and bring slowly to a simmer. Turn off heat and add the flour all at
  once. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until it forms a ball.
  Return to medium heat to dry the paste so it will have the maximum
  puffing ability: turn the ball around in the pan, pressing it against
  the sides and flipping it over, until butter starts oozing out and
  the paste no longer sticks to your fingers. Remove from heat and let
  cool a bit. Turn the paste into a medium bowl or the bowl of an
  electric mixer fitted with a paddle and beat in the eggs, one at a
  time, with a wooden spoon or the paddle. Each time you add an egg,
  the mixture will become slippery and messy but will then come
  together, at which point you can add the next egg.
  
  Load mixture into pastry bag with a round tip (1/2 or 1-inch
  depending on size puff desired) and pipe out as required. It will
  give the fullest puff if used right away but can be held for several
  hours.
  
  Basic proportions for Pate a Choux are 1:1:1:1/2, or 1 cup liquid, 1
  cup flour:1 cup egg:1/2 cup butter. Water makes choux more crisp,
  milk makes them more tender,
  
  Puffs expand when cooked as water in batter turns to steam and
  explodes the dough.
  
  Pate a choux is an extremely versatile pastry that can be the base of
  many sweet and savory dishes. It can take many forms: be poached as
  gnocchi, baked to form hollow puffy balls that can be filled with
  various things, or fried as fritters and sprinkled with sugar. It is
  neutral in flavor so is adaptable to any cuisine.

      Title: Gnocchi
 Categories: Hot
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Recipe Basic Pate a Choux
 
  Because you will need to cook the gnocchi quickly once the batter is
  ready, do the following before you begin making the pate a choux.
  Bring a large stockpot of salted water to a boil and reduce to a
  simmer. Have a large bowl of iced water nearby.
  
  Make choux paste according to directions. Fill a pastry bag with large
  plain tip #8 with batter. Holding pastry bag in over simmering water,
  gently squeeze out dough, slicing into oneinch lengths with a paring
  knife. Working in 4 batches of about 20 pieces, cook gnocchi at a
  slow simmer, stirring occasionally, until they start to puff, about 5
  minutes. They should resemble floating corks. To test for doneness,
  remove a dumpling and cut in half. The center should have tiny holes.
  With a slotted spoon, transfer gnocchi to the bowl of iced water to
  chill. Drain well in a colander. Can be stored in refrigerator for up
  to two days.

      Title: Individualized Breads For Kids And Adults
 Categories: 
      Yield: 4 servings
 
MMMMM----------------COOKING MONDAY TO FRIDAY #MF---------------------
      1 lb "commercial" bread dough,
           Divided into four 4ounce
           Pieces
           Olive oil
 
  Stuffing possibilities for each bread: 2 ounces of a melting cheese
  mozzarella for kids, goat's or fontina for adults plus 1 ounce of
  sliced prosciutto or smoked ham Seasonings for cheese: hot peppers,
  sliced pimentos, anchovy fillets; capers, scallions, or cooked
  onions; garlic, sliced black olives; snipped fresh basil, or parsley,
  dab of pesto or black olive paste, sundried tomatoes or anything you
  can think of.
  
  As best you can, coax each piece of bread into a diameter which is
  1/2inch thick. Cut or grate the cheese of choice into manageable
  pieces and scatter them on half of the dough, leaving an inch of the
  outside edge blank. Top with ham and/or seasonings of choice and
  drizzle 1 teaspoon of olive oil on the filling. Fold unfilled half of
  the bread over to cover the filling and press all around the edges to
  seal. Sprinkle some drops of olive oil on dough and, with your
  fingers, spread the oil over the entire top surface of the dough. Set
  individual stuffed breads on a lightly oiled or nonstick baking pan.
  Let the breads rise, uncovered, for 45 minutes or until doubled.
  
  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees and bake for about 20 minutes (if
  fillings ooze out a bit, don't worry). Cool the breads on a wire rack
  until lukewarm or room temperature. Serve with a crisp green salad.

      Title: Lobster Thermidor
 Categories: 
      Yield: 2 servings
 
MMMMM--------------------EMERIL LIVE #EMIA32-------------------------
      1    Whole lobster, about 2 to 2
    1/2    Pounds
      2    Lemons, halved
      1    Onion, quartered
      1    Bouquet garni
    1/4 c  Butter
    1/4 c  Flour
      2 tb Minced shallots
    1/4 c  White wine
      2 c  Milk
      1 tb Dijon mustard
      1 tb Finely chopped fresh
           Tarragon
    1/2 c  Plus 1 tablespoon grated
           Parmesan cheese
      6 oz Bacon
      1 c  Julienned onions
    1/2 lb Haricot vert, blanched
           Salt and pepper
      1 ts Chopped garlic
      2 ts Finely chopped parsley
 
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bring a pot of salted water
  containing the lemons, quartered onion and bouquet garni to a boil.
  Add the lobster to the boiling water and cook for 8 to 12 minutes.
  Remove the lobster from the water and place in a bowl of ice water.
  This will stop the cooking process of the lobster. In a sauce pan,
  melt the butter. Stir in the flour and cook for 2 to 3 minutes for a
  blond roux. Add the shallots and cook for 30 seconds. Stir in the
  wine and milk. Bring the liquid up to a boil and reduce to a simmer.
  Cook for about 3 to 4 minutes or until the sauce coats the back of a
  spoon. This sauce will be thicker than a normal Bechamel because it
  will be used as a filling. Season the sauce with salt and pepper.
  Remove the sauce from the stove and stir in the mustard and tarragon.
  Remove the lobster from the water and split the lobster in half.
  Remove the tail meat from the shells and with the back of a knife,
  gently crack the claws. Dice the tail meat and fold in the Bechamel
  sauce. Stir in 1/2 cup of the cheese and reseason if necessary.
  
  Divide the mixture and spoon into the two lobster tail shells.
  Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top of the lobster. Place the filled
  lobster on a baking sheet and place in the oven. Bake for about 8 to
  10 minutes or until the top is golden brown. In a hot saute pan, add
  the bacon and render until crispy, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add the
  onions and saute for 2 minutes. Add the beans and continue to saute
  for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the garlic.
  Remove the beans from the heat. To assemble, divide the bean mixture
  between two plates. Lay the lobster halves on top of the beans.
  Garnish with parsley.

      Title: Roasted Oysters With Country Bacon
 Categories: 
      Yield: 4 servings
 
MMMMM------------------MICHAEL'S PLACE #ML1A25-----------------------
     24    Fresh oysters, in their
           Shells
      2    Plum tomatoes
      1 pk Phyllo dough
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      1 tb Unsalted butter
      3 lg Shallots, (about 1/4 cup)
           Peeled and finely diced
    1/4 c  White wine
    1/4 c  Heavy cream
      1 tb Chopped fresh tarragon
           Leaves
      2 oz Bacon, cooked and chopped
    1/2 c  Steamed spinach (optional)
           Coarse salt
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Using a towel, grasp an oyster in the
  palm of your hand. Press the oyster, rounded side down, on a firm
  surface, still holding it with the towel. Shuck the oyster by wedging
  the tip of an oyster knife (regular knives are too thinbladed)
  between the halves of the shell, at the shell's narrowest end. When
  the knife tip is securely wedged, rotate the blade to pry open the
  shell. Slide the knife blade along the length of the shell to open
  completely. Remove the oyster from the shell and reserve, along with
  its juice. From each pair of oyster shells, save the one that is most
  concave on the inside, and discard the one that is flatter. Place the
  concave shells in a pan of cold water and scrub inside and out. Place
  the clean oyster shells on a cookie sheet and set aside.
  
  Dip the tomatoes briefly in boiling water to loosen the skins, then
  in ice water. Peel, cut in half, remove and discard the seeds and
  dice.
  
  Lay out the phyllo dough one sheet at a time on a clean work surface.
  Brush the sheet lightly with olive oil, sprinkle with coarse salt,
  crumble the sheet like a piece of newspaper and place on a cookie
  sheet. Bake at 350 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes until golden brown.
  
  Have the sauce ingredients measured and ready beside the stove. When
  you are ready to begin cooking the oysters, place the cookie sheet
  containing the oyster shells in a 350 degree oven. On the top of the
  stove, melt the butter in a hot saute pan until it begins to foam.
  Add the shallots, the oysters and their juice, and the white wine.
  Cook the oysters for 30 seconds, then add the heavy cream. Bring to a
  quick boil, then reduce to a simmer for just a minute more, or until
  the oysters' edges begin to curl. Add the tomato, tarragon, and
  bacon. Heat for another 30 seconds, then remove promptly from the
  heat.
  
  Remove the oyster shells from the oven and arrange six on each plate.
  Spoon an oyster into each shell and spoon a little of the sauce over
  each. Top each dish with top hat of crispy phyllo.

      Title: Warm Red Cabbage Salad With Pancetta And Ricotta Salata
 Categories: 
      Yield: 6 servings
 
MMMMM----------------------JOHN ASH #JA9767---------------------------
     12    Very thinly sliced rounds of
           Pancetta
      2 tb Minced shallots or green
           Onions
    1/3 c  Raspberry or red wine
           Vinegar
      2 tb Honey (or to taste)
    1/3 c  Olive oil
           Salt and pepper
  1 1/4 lb Red cabbage, cored and
           Finely shredded
    1/4 lb Ricotta salata or feta cut
           Into matchstick shapes
 
  Garnish: Fresh watercress or other young savory greens such as
  mustard, mizuna or arugula.
  
  In a large skillet, carefully saute the pancetta rounds over moderate
  heat until they just begin to firm and color, 3 to 4 minutes total.
  Do in batches, if necessary. Remove and place on paper towels to
  drain. Add the shallots, vinegar, honey and olive oil to the pan and
  season to taste with salt and pepper.
  
  Place pan over high heat and bring mixture to a boil. Add cabbage and
  toss for 2 to 3 minutes to warm through and slightly wilt cabbage. Be
  careful not to overcook cabbage should still be crunchy. Arrange on
  warm plates drizzling any cooking juices evenly over all. Place the
  rounds of pancetta and slivers of cheese attractively around and
  serve immediately with a garnish of watercress leaves if desired.
  
  Wine recommendation: The vinegar could be a problem here but the honey
  helps balance it. The salad would go well with a fruity chilled lower
  alcohol wine such as Gamay or White Zinfandel.
  
  Pancetta is the delicious cured unsmoked Italian bacon which is sold
  in roll form at good meat markets and delicatessens. It has a
  wonderful flavor and is worth seeking out. In Italy, good pancetta is
  often eaten raw. While we don't recommend that here, be careful not
  to overcook pancetta. Unlike regular bacon, it should be cooked just
  until it begins to color, not cooked crisp. This is a beautiful salad
  when you cook red cabbage with vinegar, it turns a lovely almost
  fluorescent red!

  puree with immersion blender until very smooth. Stir in cilantro and
  lime and serve, topped with corn and tomato garnish.

  Corn and tomato garnish: Stir together corn kernels with all other
  ingredients in a small bowl. Serve 2 spoonfuls on top of Avocado Soup.
  
  All of these pureed soups are delicious hot and delicious cold.
  Yields are high to allow for leftovers! Soups will be thicker when
  cold so thin if desired with milk, cream, stock or water.
  
  These recipes showcase our friends the food mill (which purees and
  separates) and immersion blender (purees in the pot, no muss, no
  fuss, no bother). Great tools for purees.
  
  Any of these pureed soups lend themselves to other garnish:
  
  a dollop of crema, creme fraiche or sour cream a sprinkling of herbs a
  spoonful of red or green salsa (crunchy texture contrast) freshly
  fried tortilla chips floating on top

      1 ts Oil or butter
      2 c  Court bouillon, strained
 
  Run fingers over fish fillets to feel for tiny bones; if there are

  the bottom of a deep skillet big enough to fit fish fillets in a
  single layer and place fish thus in skillet. Bring court bouillon to
  a simmer. Gently pour court bouillon over the fish, covering
  completely. Turn heat on very low so that liquid steams but does not
  quite simmer for 2 minutes. Turn off heat and let fish sit in liquid
  an additional 5 minutes per inch of thickness. Start checking fish
  for doneness: a thin knife inserted in thickest part of fillet should
  meet with just slight resistance. Fish should still be slightly
  translucent in center. Remove fish from skillet with slotted spatula,
  blot the bottom lightly with a paper towel, and serve.
  
  Poaching is a delicious way to prepare fish without adding fat. Great
  for dinner parties: because the cooking is gentle, it allows a wide
  margin of error, fish won't overcook too quickly.
  
  Properly poached fish has a wonderful silky texture.

  Courtbouillon means quickboiling in French; it doesn't need to cook
  for long (compared to a stock). Can use this courtbouillon to poach
  any fish as well as shrimp, squid, etc.
  
  A courtbouillon should be fullflavored and wellseasoned, with a good
  dose of acidity to firm up the protein in the fish. No need to season
  fish fillets with salt and pepper as seasoning is already in the
  liquid.

      6 lg Red or yellow bell peppers
      6    Thin slices of prosciutto
      6    Thin slices of Fontina
           Olive oil for brushing on
           Peppers
 
  Arrange the peppers on a grill rack above a charcoal fire, on wire
  racks positioned over the burners of a gas or electric stove, 2 to 3
  inches under a preheated broiler, or in an oven preheated to 400
  degrees F. Roast them until they are charred all over and tender
  inside, turning them frequently to insure they cook evenly, about 25
  minutes in the oven, but less time by the other methods. Remove them
  from the oven but leave the oven on. When the peppers are cool enough
  to handle, using a sharp knife, cut them in half vertically, like a
  sandwich. Care should be taken not to break the skin. Carefully
  remove the stem and lift off the skin. Remove all of the seeds.
  
  Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F.
  
  Place a slice each of prosciutto and fontina on the inside of one
  half of each pepper. Replace the matching half over the filling.
  Brush lightly with olive oil and place on a foil-lined baking sheet.
  Use two baking sheets if necessary. Place the peppers in the oven,
  placing the baking sheet(s) on the middle rack. Cook until the cheese
  is melted and the peppers are heated through, about 15 minutes. Serve
  hot or warm

  Peel the onions, leaving and washing any root strand you may find.
  
  In a 12 to 14-inch saute pan over a medium high flame, heat virgin
  olive oil until just smoking. Add butter and cook until foam
  subsides. Add onions and saute until light golden brown on all sides,
  about 8 to 10 minutes. Add sugar, vinegar, tomato sauce and water and
  bring to a boil.
  
  Cook onions uncovered, until just al dente, about 10 minutes. If
  liquid dissipates too quickly, add more water, a 1/4 cup at a time,
  realizing that it is essential not to overcook the onions. The sauce
  should just adhere to the onions. Remove from saute pan to an
  earthenware dish and hold in a warm place, or allow to cool if you
  are serving them later or as an antipasto.

MMMMM-----------------VINAIGRETTE FOR THE GARDEN----------------------
      1 c  Red wine vinegar
    1/2 c  Soy
    1/2 c  Dark roasted sesame oil
    1/2 c  Chopped cilantro leaves
    1/2 c  Hot chile oil
      3 tb Peeled, chopped ginger
      3    Tablespoons, minced garlic
  1 1/2 tb Sugar

MMMMM---------------------------GARDEN--------------------------------
      8 c  Mixed vegetables
           Peanut oil or canola oil for
           Sauteing the vegetables
 
  Soak the dried tea in the balsamic for a minimum of 30 minutes before
  proceeding with the next step.
  
  Heat a medium sized shallow saucepan. Add the butter and allow to foam
  briefly. Now scatter the shallots across the bottom of the pan and
  stir occasionally to coat them.
  
  When the shallots are caramelized, add the sugar and stir again. Now
  add the tea and balsamic and stir. Allow the vinegar to reduce almost
  completely. Season with salt and pepper. Remove to a bowl and allow to
  cool.
  
  Lay the ribbon cuts out on a cutting board. Take the prepared salmon
  and keep the best looking side down. Sprinkle or rub the tea mixture
  sparingly down the length of each ribbon.
  
  Roll the ribbons up into a tight circle and secure them with a skewer
  from the 12 o'clock to 6 o' clock position and the 3 to 9 o'clock
  position.
  
  Refrigerate until ready to grill them.
  
  Note: The tea mixture without the fish can be made up to a week in
  advance and stored in the refrigerator.
  
  For the lemon: Put the lemon juice, vinegar, shallots, bay leaf and
  cracked black pepper in a small, heavy, nonreactive saucepan and
  bring it to a simmer over a medium heat. Allow the liquid to reduce
  until only about 3 ounces remain. Now add the cream. Once it boils,
  whisk in the butter, a bit at a time until it is incorporated. Strain
  the sauce through a fine meshed strainer and keep in a warm place.
  
  Vinaigrette for the garden: Mix all ingredients together and set
  aside.
  
  For the garden: An assortment of 8 cup mixed vegetables with an Asian
  aesthetic. I like to use a mix of cucumbers, purple cabbage, red and
  yellow bell peppers, blanched snow peas, blanched asparagus spears,
  bean sprouts and shiitake mushrooms.
  
  When you are almost ready to eat, fire up a hot grill.
  
  Grill the spirals until just done, about 4 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile
  heat a large wok or skillet until very hot. Add the oil for stir
  frying the vegetables. Add the vegetables and cook briefly together.
  Add enough of the vinaigrette to lightly dress them. (Reserve any
  extra in the refrigerator for another time.) Season to taste.
  
  Place the cooked fish in the center of four plates. Remove the
  skewers. Spoon some of the prepared lemon butter around the fish.
  Mound the vegetables over the fish. Serve.

 Categories: 
      Yield: 6 Appetizers
 
MMMMM--------------------MOLTO MARIO #MB5685-------------------------
    1/2 lb Sweet sausage
      2 tb Olive oil
     12    Cloves garlic, peeled
      1 lg Red bell peppers
      1 lg Green bell peppers
    1/2 lb Fresh mozzarella, cut into
      3    Inch by 1/4-inch by 1/4-inch
           Strips
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Sugar
      2 c  Polenta (cornmeal)
    1/4 c  Parmigiano-Reggiano
      1    Terrine mold, 12-inch long
           By 4-inch wide by 4-inch
           Deep
 
  Bake sausage at 350 F for 20 minutes, then drain and crumble to
  resemble rough bread crumbs. Set aside.  Core and seed bell peppers
  and cut into 1/2"-wide strips.
  
  In a medium saute pan, heat the olive oil. Gently saute the whole
  garlic cloves until golden brown on all sides, about 8 to 10 minutes.
  Add the peppers and saute until soft, but not browned, about 7 to 8
  minutes longer. Remove from heat. Separate and let cool.
  
  Bring the mozzarella to room temperature. Place the sausage, peppers,
  garlic and mozzarella around a cutting board, all in separate bowls.
  
  Bring 6 cups water to a boil, adding the salt and sugar. Slowly add
  the cornmea to the boiling water in a thin stream, whisking
  continuously. Lower heat and cook until the polenta resembles the
  texture of hot cereal. Remove the pot from heat.
  
  Moving quickly, pour the polenta into the terrine mold about 3/4-inch
  from the top. Sprinkle all the crumbled sausage over the polenta.
  Cover the sausage with about 1-1/2 cups warm polenta. Using a
  spatula, flatten and smooth the polenta to create a flat surface.
  Next, layer the peppers and the garlic cloves. Repeat with another
  layer of 1-1/2 cups warm polenta over the peppers. Remember to smooth
  and flatten the polenta layer to make a nice flat surface all the way
  to the edges. Lay the mozzarella over the polenta (but do not bring
  the mozzarella to the edges). Pour another layer of warm polenta over
  the mozzarella to fill the terrine. Smooth the top layer all the way
  to the edges. There may be left over polenta.
  
  Chill the terrine overnight.
  
  To serve, invert the terrine over a cutting board. It should come out
  quite easily. Slice the terrine as you would slice bread, about
  3/4-inch thick. Place the slice flat on a baking sheet. Bake for 10
  to 12 minutes. Sprinkle with grated cheese and serve immediately.

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
           Powdered sugar
 
  This is a simple recipe. The sauce can be prepared days ahead of time
  and reheated. The fritters however should be prepared at the last
  minute.
  
  RED WINE STAR ANISE DESSERT SAUCE: Place all ingredients in a
  saucepan and bring to a boil. Immediately reduce heat and simmer
  slowly for 10 minutes. Off heat, allow to cool and strain. Store
  covered in refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.
  
  Fritters: Add the butter and water to a saucepan and bring to a boil.
  Remove pan from heat and, with a wooden spoon, beat in flour all at
  once to form a smooth paste. Beat lemon juice, zest and vanilla and
  then beat in eggs one at a time. Be sure to thoroughly incorporate
  each egg before adding the next.
  
  Heat 1/2-inch of oil in a deep skillet or wok to 360 degrees. Working
  in batches, drop rounded tablespoons of dough into the oil and fry
  until golden brown about 1- 1/2 minutes on each side. Be careful not
  to crowd fritters. Drain on paper towels and keep warm in a 225
  degree oven for up to 20 minutes.
  
  Place a shallow pool of warm Red Wine Star Anise Sauce in individual
  serving bowls. Place 3 or 4 fritters on top. Scatter sliced berries
  attractively around and dust with powdered sugar. Serve immediately.

    1/4 c  Heavy cream
      5 tb Cold unsalted butter, cut
           Into very small pieces
      1 tb Melted butter
 
  Wash the chicken under cold water. Tie the bay leaves, peppercorns,
  rosemary and thyme together in a piece of cheesecloth as a sachet
  garni. Put the chicken into a pot large enough to hold it, cover with
  cold water and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 15
  minutes, carefully skimming off any scum and grease that accumulates
  on the surface of the water. Add the salt, sachet garni and onion,
  carrot, celery and leek, return to the boil, reduce again to a strong
  simmer and cook for 45 minutes.
  
  Turn off the heat and cool the chicken in the broth in an ice water
  bath. When thoroughly cold, remove the chicken and strip off all of
  the skin and discard. Strip the meat from the bones, and shred using
  scrupulously clean hands and work station. Strain the liquid, discard
  the vegetables and the bouquet garni.
  
  EXOTIC MUSHROOMS AND TARRAGON CREAM: Place the chicken broth in a 4
  quart casserole and bring to the boil. Add the carrots and celery and
  simmer for 10 minutes. Mean put he butter in a saute pan and begin to
  cook the shallots over medium heat. Add the mushrooms to the pan and
  cook over high heat for 5 minutes. Add the cream to the pot over
  broth and vegetables and then add the sauteed mushrooms to the pot.
  Simmer this for 5 minutes before adding the chicken and continuing to
  cook for 20 minutes. Add the tarragon and place into single serving
  crocks or bowls and top each one with a biscuit.
  
  POT PIE TOPS: In the bowl of a mixer fitted with a paddle, combine the
  flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. After the dry ingredients are
  thoroughly blended, add the buttermilk, cream and combine. Add the
  cold butter in rapid succession, combining only briefly, to leave the
  mixture as mealy as possible. Scrape this lumpy dough onto a lightly
  floured board and flatten gently with a rolling pin into a rectangle
  shape approximately 1-inch thick. Cut into 4 or 6 equal rounds. Brush
  a cookie sheet lightly with melted butter, place the rounds on the
  sheet and place the cookie sheet into the refrigerator to rest for 20
  minutes, while you preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Bake the chilled

  boiling cream over the chocolate. Allow to stand for 5 minutes, thin
  stir until smooth (now you have ganache). Refrigerate the ganache for
  1 hour until firm but not hard.
  
  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using a tablespoon of
  ganache for each truffle (approximately 3/4 ounce), portion 24
  truffles, evenly space onto the parchment lined baking sheet.
  Refrigerate the ganache portions for 15 minutes (so the ganache will
  be firm enough to roll into truffles). When the ganache is firm
  enough to handle, remove from the refrigerator and individually roll
  each portion of ganache in your palms, in a gentle circular motion,
  using just enough pressure to form smooth rounds. Roll 16 of the
  rounds in 2 tablespoons cocoa and separately roll 8 in the
  confectioners sugar until completely covered. Store the truffles in a
  tightly sealed plastic container, in the refrigerator. Remove about 1
  hour before serving.

      2 lb Fresh chaurice patties
      1 tb Chopped parsley
      1    Loaf of crusty Portuguese
           Bread
 
  In a braising pan, over medium heat, add the oil. When the oil is hot
  add the onions and crushed bay leaves. Fry the onions in the oil
  until golden about 3 to 4 minutes. Season the onions with salt and
  pepper. Stir in the garlic, peppers, and carrots. Continue to saute
  for 2 minutes. Add the potatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in
  the stock. Place the patties of sausage in the center of the
  vegetables. Add the red wine. The stock should come up to 2/3 of the
  way up the sausage. So, add the stock slowly. Save the reserved stock
  to add during braising. Bring the liquid to a boil and reduce to a
  simmer. Simmer the sausage for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until the
  vegetables are tender and the sauce has a gravy like consistency. Add
  the remaining stock about every 30 minutes. Ladle the stew into bowls
  and serve with crusty bread. Garnish with parsley.

      Title: Fast French Puff Pastry
 Categories: Emeril
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 c  Unbleached all-purpose
           Flour
      1 c  Plain bleached cake flour
  6 1/2    Sticks chilled unsalted
           Butter
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Ice water
 
  Place the flour in your mixing bowl. Rapidly cut the sticks of chilled
  butter into lengthwise quarters, then into 1/2-inch dice; add to the
  flour. Add the salt. Blend flour and butter together rapidly, the
  butter should be roughly broken up but stay in lumps the size of
  large lima beans. Blend in the water, mixing just enough so that
  dough masses roughly together but butter pieces remain about the same
  size. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Rapidly
  push and pat and roll it out into a 12 by 18-inch rectangle. It will
  look messy.
  
  Lightly flour top of dough and, with a pastry sheet to help you, flip
  the bottom of the rectangle up over the middle, and then flip the top
  down to cover it, as though folding a business letter. Lift the dough
  off the work surface with a pastry sheet; scrape the work surface
  clean, flour the surface lightly and return the dough to it, settling
  it down in front of you so that the top flap is at your right.
  Lightly flour top of the dough, and pat, push, and roll it out again
  into a rectangle; it will look a little less messy. Fold again into
  three as before, each of three "roll-and-fold" operations is called a
  "turn". Roll out and fold 2 more times, making 4 "turns" in all, and
  by the last "turn" of the pastry it should actually look like dough.
  You should see large flakes of butter scattered under the surface on
  the dough, which is just as it should be. With the balls of your
  fingers make 4 depressions in the dough to indicate the 4 turns. Wrap
  the dough in plastic, place in a plastic bag and refrigerate for 40
  minutes to firm the butter and relax the gluten in the dough. Give
  the dough 2 more turns, beating it back and forth and up and down
  first if chilled and hard. Let the dough rest another 30 minutes if
  it seems rubbery and hard to roll; then it is ready for forming and
  baking.

      Title: Ham Pithiviers
 Categories: Emeril
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      6 oz Best quality ham
      2 tb Minced shallots
      2    Egg yolks
    1/4 c  Heavy cream
        dr Worcestershire sauce
        dr Hot pepper sauce
           Freshly ground pepper
    2/3    Puff pastry, recipe above
      6 tb Grated Parmesan, Swiss,
           And/or Cheddar cheese
           Egg glaze (1 egg beaten with
      1 ts Water)
 
  Cut the ham into thin irregular slices about 1 by 1 by 1/8-inch and
  saute briefly in the butter with the shallots or scallions, just to
  warm through thoroughly. Remove from the heat. In a small bowl, beat
  the egg yolks with the cream; stir this mixture into the ham along
  with drops of Worcestershire and pepper sauce and freshly ground
  pepper to taste. Warm over low heat, folding the ham into the sauce,
  until it thickens but does not boil. Set aside to cool and thicken
  even more. It should be cold when it goes into the Pithiviers. Roll
  the dough out into a rectangle about 18 by 9 inches and cut into
  thirds crosswise; refrigerate 2 pieces, wrapping and storing one of
  them for another use.
  
  Roll remaining pieces, which will be the bottom of the tart, into a
  square 12 inches to a side; using a pie plate or cake pan to guide
  you, cut a 9 1/2-inch disk out of the center of the dough. Remove
  surrounding dough and set on a bake sheet for reconstituting later.
  Lightly fold disk in half and set upside down on dampened baking
  surface. Roll out second piece of dough to a thickness slightly more
  than 1/4-inch and cut into a disk the same size as the first.
  Refrigerate it along with the surrounding dough pieces from both
  disks. With the balls of you fingers, push and pat the bottom disk of
  the dough out onto its baking surface to make an even circle slightly
  larger than your cutting guide. With a roller-pricker or two forks,
  prick the dough all over at 1/2-inch intervals, going down through
  dough to pastry sheet to keep this bottom layer from rising too much.
  Form the ham into a round cake about 4 1/2 inches across and place in
  the center of the dough. It is important to leave a 2-inch border of
  clear dough all around the ham to prevent leakage of the filling
  during baking.
  
  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
  
  Paint the border of the dough with cold water, and immediately center
  the top layer in place, stretching gently as necessary. With a
  sharp-pointed knife make a little hole 1/8- inch wide in the center
  of the dough, going down into the filling, to allow for escaping
  steam during baking, Then, with the ball of your first three fingers,
  firmly press the two pieces of dough in place all around. Bake the
  Pithiviers for about 20 minutes, until it has puffed and is beginning
  to brown nicely. Turn down the oven to 400 degrees F and continue to
  bake for 20 to 30 minutes. If the Pithivier begins to brown too
  quickly, cover the pie with foil loosely and continue to bake. Remove
  from the oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes before slicing. Slice
  the pie into wedges.

  Cook the minced shallots or scallions in butter, in a small frying
  pan or saucepan, for a minute or 2 without browning. Then add the
  tomato and cook over moderately high heat for several minutes until
  juices have exuded and tomato pulp has thickened enough to hold its
  shape lightly in a spoon. Season carefully to taste. Just before
  serving, fold in the herbs.

      Title: Giant Straw Potato Galette
 Categories: Emeril
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      6 md Potatoes, preferably
           "baking", peeled and soaking
           In water
      6 tb Or more clarified butter
           Salt and pepper
 
  Using a mandoline, cut the potatoes into matchstick sized pieces. Dry
  the potatoes with a cloth towel. As soon as the potatoes are cut and
  dry, film the frying pan with a 1/16 layer of clarified butter, and
  heat to very hot but not browning. Turn in the potatoes, making a
  layer about 3/8-inch thick. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and 2 or 3
  spoonfuls more butter, then press them down firmly all over with the
  spatula so they will flatten as they cook. Frequently press them down
  white they slowly brown on the bottom, and shake pan gently by its
  handle to be sure potatoes are not sticking to the pan. When browned,
  in 2 to 3 minutes, cover the pan and lower heat to moderate. Cook for
  6 to 8 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender on top, but watch
  they do not burn on the bottom. Press them down again, and the
  galette is ready to brown on its other side. To turn it: either slide
  it out onto an oiled baking sheet, turn the frying pan upside down
  over it, and reverse the two so the galette drops into the pan,
  browned side up; or flip the galette in its pan, which, of course, is
  much more fun and faster.

  1 1/2 c  Walnut pieces
    1/2 c  Pure maple syrup
      2 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Fresh lemon juice
      2 oz Unsweetened chocolate,
           Chopped into 1/4-inch
           Pieces
 
  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
  
  Toast the walnuts on a baking sheet in the preheated oven for 8
  minutes. Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature.
  
  Heat the maple syrup in a 1 1/2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat.
  When the syrup begins to boil, reduce the heat to medium and allow
  the syrup to continue to boil and thicken for 10 minutes, stirring
  occasionally with a metal spoon. Remove the very hot syrup from the
  heat. Immediately add the walnuts to the syrup and stir to combine.
  Transfer the glazed walnuts to a baking sheet with sides. Use a metal
  spoon to spread the walnuts evenly over one half of the baking sheet.
  Set aside.
  
  Place the sugar and lemon juice in a 3-quart saucepan. Stir with a
  whisk to combine (the sugar will resemble moist sand). Caramelize the
  sugar by heating for 10 to 10 1/2 minutes over medium-high heat,
  stirring constantly with a wire whisk to break up any lumps (the
  sugar will first turn clear as it liquefies, then light brown as it
  caramelizes. Remove the saucepan from the heat, add the unsweetened
  chocolate and stir to dissolve. Immediately and carefully pour the
  caramelized mixture over the walnuts, covering all the nuts. Allow to
  harden at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.
  
  Invert the praline onto a clean, dry cutting board (it should pop
  right out of the baking sheet), this will keep the shiny side looking
  shiny after cutting. Use a sharp serrated slicer to cut (use a sawing
  motion) the praline into desired size pieces. Store the pralines in a
  tightly sealed plastic container until ready to devour.

      Title: Road Trip Cookies
 Categories: Baker, Desserts
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
      6 oz Semisweet chocolate, chopped
           Into 1/4-inch pieces
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar
    3/4 c  Tightly packed light brown
           Sugar
    1/4 lb Room temperature unsalted
           Butter
      2 lg Eggs
      2 ts Pure vanilla extract
      3 c  M&M's peanuts
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
  
  In a sifter combine the flour, baking soda and salt. Sift onto a large
  piece of waxed paper and set aside until needed.
  
  Heat 1-inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium
  heat. With the heat on, place the semisweet chocolate in the top half
  of the double boiler. Use a rubber spatula to stir the chocolate until
  completely melted and smooth, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a
  1-quart bowl and set aside.
  
  Place the granulated sugar, light brown sugar and butter in a 7-quart
  bowl. Use a stiff rubber spatula (or a wooden spoon) to cream the
  ingredients together until smooth. Add the eggs and vanilla extract
  and mix to incorporate. Add the melted chocolate and mix until
  combined. Add the sifted dry ingredients and thoroughly combine. Add
  the M&M=s, mixing to incorporate.
  
  Using 3 heaping tablespoons of dough for each cookie (approximately 3
  ounces), portion 6 cookies, evenly spaced, onto each of 3 nonstick
  baking sheets (this is a hefty cookie, so don't crowd). Place the
  baking sheets on the top and center racks of the preheated oven and
  bake for 14 minutes. Remove the cookies from the oven and cool to
  room temperature on the baking sheets, about 30 minutes. Store the
  cooled cookies in a tightly sealed plastic container until ready to

      Title: Chocolate Lollapaloozas
 Categories: Baker
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Unsalted peanuts
  1 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
    1/4 ts Cream of tartar
    1/4 c  Water
    1/2    -ounce unsweetened chocolate
           Chopped into 1/4-inch
           Pieces
     12 oz Semisweet chocolate, chopped
           Into 1/4-inch pieces
 
  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Toast the peanuts on a baking sheet
  in the preheated oven for 1
  
  minute. Cool to room temperature. Process the peanuts in the bowl of
  a food processor fitted with a metal blade until finely chopped,
  about 8 to 10 seconds. Set aside.
  
  Heat the sugar, cream of tartar and water in a 1 1/2-quart saucepan
  over medium-high heat. When hot, stir with a whisk to dissolve the
  sugar. Bring to a boil. Boil the mixture, stirring often, for 8 to 10
  minutes, until the mixture takes on a light honey color. Remove the
  pan from the heat. Add the unsweetened chocolate, and stir gently
  (and carefully, this is very hot stuff) to incorporate.
  
  One at a time, dip 1-inch of one end of each popsicle stick into the
  hot sugar mixture. Divide the dipped stick onto 4 nonstick baking
  sheets, leaving lots of space between sticks. Use a metal spoon to
  stir the mixture for 3 to 4 minutes, until it begins to get very
  syrupy in texture (even though I said texture, that doesn't mean you
  can touch, it's still too hot to handle at this point). Pour a full
  tablespoon of the sugar mixture over the dipped ends of each stick,
  allowing the mixture to flow into a round lollipoplike shape. Allow
  the chocolate lollipops (that's right, they're not lollipaloozas yet)
  to harden at room temperature.
  
  Heat 1-inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium
  heat. With the heat on, place the semisweet chocolate in the top half
  of the double boiler. Use a rubber spatula to stir the chocolate until
  completely melted and smooth, about 3 minutes. transfer the melted
  chocolate to a 1-quart bowl. Place the chopped peanuts on a baking
  sheet. Grasp (or perhaps you would prefer to hold) a chocolate
  lollipop by the stick end and dip the hardened sugar end into the
  chocolate to completely cover. Allow excess chocolate to drip off
  before sprinkling chopped peanuts on both sides to cover the
  chocolate. Place the lollipalooza on a baking sheet. Repeat with
  remaining lollipaloozas. Refrigerate to harden the chocolate. Store
  in a tightly sealed plastic container in the refrigerator until ready
  to serve.

  the melted chocolate to a stainless steel bowl and set aside until
  needed. Place 2 1/2 cups heavy cream and 2 tablespoons sugar in the
  well-chilled bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a well-chilled
  balloon whip. Whisk on high until stiff peaks form, about 1 1/2
  minutes. Remove the bowl from the mixer. Use a hand whisk to combine
  1/4 of the whipped cream into the melted chocolate until smooth and
  completely incorporated. Add the combined whipped cream and chocolate
  to the remaining whipped cream and use a rubber spatula to fold
  together.
  
  Transfer the dark chocolate cream to a stainless steel bowl. Tightly

  rendered and the skin is golden. Pour off most of the rendered fat,
  reserving 3 tablespoons for later. Transfer the pan to the oven and
  finish roasting until medium rare, about 5 minutes.
  
  In a saute pan, heat the reserved duck fat. Add the shallots, garlic,
  ginger, and pears. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 2 minutes.
  Add the eau-de-vie, balsamic vinegar and stock and cook over high
  heat, about 3 minutes, until the mixture is slightly thick and the
  pears are tender. Remove from the heat and stir in the thyme, walnuts
  and season with salt and pepper.
  
  Thinly slice each duck breast and serve with sauce. Garnish with thyme
  sprigs.

  MENU OF THE WEEK by Georgia Downard, Culinary Director
  
  Tis the season for pears! We've just returned from our local green
  market where pears are playing to standing ovations. Stall after
  stall were filled with this wonderfully juicy fruit in all its
  varieties. Pears are at a season high both in flavor and supply.
  According to the weekly produce newspaper The Packer, "Evidence
  already suggests the bigger crop will mean lower prices than last
  year.." So join us in celebrating this magnificent fruit. We've
  included a selection of recipes which should satisfy all pear lovers
  and make converts of others!
  
  PEAR, CRANBERRY AND HORSERADISH CHUTNEY
  
  (Serve with roast chicken, turkey or duck, also good with ham or
  pork. A delicious addition to a holiday table.)
  
  DUCK BREAST OVER GREENS
  
  (The pears in this recipe are a light and refreshing foil to the
  sauteed duck. This dish is very quick and suitable for entertaining.
  Chicken breast can be substituted for duck, simply increase the
  cooking time.)
  
  POACHED PEARS WITH MASCARPONE AND ESPRESSO SAUCE
  
  (This is a beautiful, celebratory dish that does justice to the
  perfectly formed pear. Remember that the pears can be poached ahead
  of time and chilled.)

      Title: Poached Pears With Mascarpone And Espresso Sauce
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 c  Water
    1/2 c  White wine
    1/2 c  Good Port wine
      4 tb Sugar
      1    Cinnamon stick
      2    To 3 whole cloves
      4    Firm Bartlett pears
      1 c  Italian mascarpone cheese,
           Or other fresh, sweet, cow's
           Milk cheese
      2 tb Clover honey
    1/4 ts Vanilla
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
      2 tb Poppy seeds for garnish
      2 tb Dried cherries
 
  Bring the water, wines, sugar, and spices to a boil in a pot just
  large enough to hold the pears.  Lower the heat and simmer for 5
  minutes. While the poaching liquid is cooking, peel but do not core
  the pears (use a vegetable peeler for the neatest job with the least
  waste).
  
  Poach the pears, uncovered, for 20 minutes, or until they are just
  tender to the tip of a knife.  Remove from the heat and cool the
  pears in the liquid for another 20 minutes.  You can then refrigerate
  them (still in the liquid) for later use.
  
  In a stainless steel bowl, combine the mascarpone, honey, vanilla,
  cinnamon, and nutmeg and whisk to form a smooth creamy filling. Place
  the cheese filling into a clean pastry bag fitted with a star tip.
  
  Remove the pears from the liquid, drain and dry them.  Cut the pears
  in half lengthwise, and remove the core with a teaspoon, making a
  neat opening for the mascarpone filling.  Slice a sliver off the
  round side of the pear to steady it on the plate.
  
  Pipe a neat star-shaped dollop into the pear, place it in a serving
  dish, pour some espresso sauce around it and garnish with poppy seeds
  and dried cherries.
  
  Yield: 4 full and 8 small portions.

      Title: Espresso Sauce
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Whole milk
      1    Vanilla bean
      4    Egg yolks
    1/3 c  Granulated sugar
    1/4 c  Strong espresso coffee
 
  Pour the milk into a heavy-bottomed pot.  On a cutting board, split
  the vanilla bean down the middle and, using the tip of your knife,
  scrape all the seeds into the milk.  Add the bean pod and bring the
  milk gently to a boil over medium heat, being careful not to scorch
  the milk or allow it to boil over.  Reduce the heat to moderately low
  heat and cook uncovered for 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and
  allow the vanilla bean to steep in the milk for another 5 minutes.
  Remove and discard vanilla pod.
  
  Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl of an electric mixer, whip the egg yolks
  and sugar together at medium speed for 5 minutes.  Add 1/4 cup of the
  scalded milk in a stream, whisking, to the egg mixture to temper it
  and whisk the egg mixture back into the milk.  Cook over moderately
  low heat, stirring constantly, until custard is thick enough to coat
  the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat, strain through a fine
  sieve into a bowl and cool completely over an ice water bath before
  serving.

  wrapping each foot in cheesecloth, then tying with kitchen string.
  Add enough water just to cover, weight with a heavy plate, then cover
  and slowly simmer over medium-low heat for four hours.  Cool, then
  refrigerate over night in cooking liquid.
  
  2.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Combine bread, ham, shallots,
  parsley, milk, egg, and 1\4 cup wine in medium bowl.  Mix well and
  season with salt. Unwrap and separate pigs' feet.  Using your

  should remain in place). Divide stuffing between feet, spooning about
  1\4 cup into each cavity. Rinse caul fat, and cut into four pieces,
  each about 12" by 12". reassemble pig's feet, wrap each in caul fat,
  then fit snugly in a roasting pan. Add remaining 1\4 cup wine and
  roast until golden, about 45 minutes. Separate halves again and serve

           Sugar, packed
 
  Adjust rack in lower third of oven.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  Grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans, and insert parchment
  paper or waxed paper to line the bottoms.  Sift the flour, baking
  soda, and salt onto a sheet of waxed paper; set aside.  Place the
  cocoa in a 1-quart mixing bowl. Add the 1/2 cup lukewarm water, and
  whisk to combine; set aside to cool. Pour the buttermilk, the 1/2 cup
  water, and the vanilla into a liquid cup measure.  Crack the eggs
  into a small bowl, and whisk together to combine the yolks and
  whites. Place the butter in the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer,
  preferably fitted with a flat beater. Cream the butter on medium
  speed until the butter is smooth and lighter in color, about 30 to 45
  seconds. Reduce the speed to low, add the sugars in a steady stream.
  When all the sugar is added, stop the machine, and scrape the mixture
  clinging to the side of the bowl into the center.  The mixture will
  appear sandy. Increase the speed to medium again, and cream until the
  mixture is light in color, is fluffy in texture, and appears as one
  mass, about 5 to 7 minutes. With the mixer still on medium speed,
  pour the eggs slowly at first. Continue to cream, scraping the sides
  of the bowl at least once, until the mixture appears fluffy and
  velvety. Stop the machine and spoon in the cooled cocoa mixture,
  resume at medium speed and mix just until incorporated. Using a
  rubber spatula, stir in one-fourth of the flour mixture. Then
  one-third of the buttermilk mixture, stirring to blend
  
  together.  Repeat this procedure, alternating dry and liquid.  With
  each addition, scrape the sides of the bowl, and continue mixing
  until smooth, never adding liquid if any flour is visible. Pour the
  batter into the pans and spread it level.  Bake for 25 minutes, or
  until the baked surface springs back slightly when touched lightly in
  the center and the sides contract from the pan. Place the cake pans
  on a rack to cool for 5 to 10 minutes.  With mitts, tilt and rotate
  pans gently tapping them on the counter to see if the cake releases
  from sides.
  
  Yield: Two 8-inch layers
  
  GANACHE FILLING
  
  8 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped 1 cup
  heavy cream
  
  Put the chocolate in a medium bowl.  In a small saucepan, heat the
  heavy cream just to the boil.  Remove from heat.  Pour over chocolate
  and whisk until chocolate melts and mixture is smooth and shiny.
  ASSEMBLING THE DESSERT: Split each layer of cake in half horizontally
  and place one layer, cut side up, on a cardboard round.  Spread with
  one-third of the ganache filling.  Center a second layer on top of
  the first, and spread it with one-third of the ganache filling.
  Place another layer, cut side up, on top, and spread with remaining
  filling and turn he last layer upside down, and center it over the
  filling.

      Title: Frosting And Chocolate Glaze
 Categories: Baker
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Heavy cream, whipped
     10 oz Semisweet chocolate, finely
           Chopped
      1 c  Heavy cream
 
  Frost the cake with the whipped cream. Place the cake on a wire rack,
  then set it on a sheet pan that will fit the dimensions of your
  freezer. Place in the freezer for 40 minutes only, (his is just
  enough time to chill the whipped cream frosting so it's firm to the
  touch, not soft.) While the cake is in the freezer, prepare the dark
  chocolate glaze. Put the chocolate in a medium bowl. In a small
  saucepan, heat the heavy cream just to the boil. Remove from heat.
  Pour over chocolate and whisk until chocolate melts and mixture is
  smooth and shiny. Set aside to cool to body temperature.
  
  Set the cake on its wire rack over a baking pan with sides (like a
  jelly roll pan) on top of a turntable (or lazy susan.) Pour almost
  all of the chocolate glaze over the center of the cake. Using a long,
  flexible metal icing spatula, use just a few strokes to spread the
  glaze over the top of the cake so the glaze runs down over the sides.
  Rotate the turntable as you spread. Use the spatula to scoop up
  excess glaze to touch it to any bare spots on the sides of the cake
  to cover them. Place the cake on a serving plate. Refrigerate until
  30 to 60 minutes before serving. Using a serrated knife, dipped into
  hot water after each slice, cut dessert into wedges.

           Cutting the Cake
 
  The genoise is cut in such a fashion that its exterior is left
  intact, but a core is removed Imagine a 1/2-inch thick border around
  the outside edge of the cake.  Now, using the tip of a shortbladed
  paring knife, cut along the imaginary line with a sawing motion
  around the entire cake, stopping short of the cake's bottom by
  1/2-inch. Loosen the 6 1/2 -inch circle or inner core the cake
  without disturbing the outer shell Using a small serrated knife such
  as a tomato knife, insert the blade into the side of the cake 1/2
  ~inch from the bottom, creating a small slit. Keeping the knife
  horizontal and level, pivot the serrated edge in one direction,
  trying not to cut through the outer shell of cake.  (This will
  eventually loosen the entire bottom of the inner core.)
  
  Remove the knife, insert it back into the slit with the serrated edge
  facing the opposite direction, and pivot the other way.  Repeat three
  more times, rotating the cake a quarter turn each time.  After
  completing four cuts, you should have loosened the core sufficiently
  to lift it out. Test it gently with a fork around the edge of the
  core; if you meet resistance anywhere, insert the serrated knife back
  into the nearest slit, and pivot the blade again.  Be patient and
  keep pivoting as well as tracing the top circle, and soon you'll be
  able to lift the core with the aid of the fork.
  
  Remove the center core of the cake; it should measure about 6 1/2 to 7
  inches in diameter and be about 1-inch thick.  Place the core on a
  flat work surface.  Mentally divide it in half horizontally.  Now,
  using the paring knife, cut all the way around the side of the cake
  about 1/2-inch deep on that imaginary line.  Slide a 12-inch knife
  into the cut. Holding the knife steady in that path, rotate the cake
  in a circle into the knife blade, cutting in a slow sawing motion all
  around, until the cake is evenly split into two 1/2-inch thick layers.
  
  Remove the top 1/2-inch layer, wrap it in plastic, and save for
  future use. Split the remaining 1/2- inch layer into two 1/4-inch
  thick layers, using the same cutting procedure as above.  Remove the
  top 1/4-inch layer and set aside.  (Use a removable quiche bottom to
  aid in lifting, if necessary.)

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 oz Cream cheese, room
           Temperature
      3 tb Unsalted butter, room
           Temperature
      1 tb Sour cream
      1 ts Lemon zest
      2 lg Egg yolks
      2 tb Water
    1/4 c  Granulated sugar
    1/4 c  Heavy cream
 
  In a 2 to 3 quart mixing bowl, manipulate the cream cheese with a
  rubber spatula until smooth. Gradually add the butter, stirring until
  smooth and homogeneous. Lastly, stir in the sour cream and lemon
  zest; set aside. Place the egg yolks in the bowl of a heavy-duty
  mixer and with the whisk attachment, whip them on medium speed (#5)
  until light in color and fluffy in texture (about 2 minutes). Detach
  whisk and remove bowl; set whisk close by to use later. Combine the
  water and sugar in a heavybottomed saucepan or sugar pot. Place over
  low heat, swirling the pot occasionally to distribute heat until the
  sugar completely dissolves (about 2 minutes). Keep a pastry brush in
  a small glass of water to wash down any sugar crystals that form
  along the sides of the pot. As soon as the sugar has dissolved,
  increase heat to high and boil until it registers 238 degrees (soft
  ball stage) on a mercury candy thermometer (about 5 minutes). Quickly
  pour the syrup into the center of the whipped yolks and whisk
  vigorously by hand to combine, using the mixer's whisk attachment.
  Reattach the bowl and its whisk to the mixer and whip on medium speed
  (#5) until the egg yolk mixture thickens, increases in volume,
  lightens in color and texture and cools to room temperature (about 4
  minutes). Whisk into the cream cheese mixture until blended smoothly.
  Whip the heavy cream in a deep 1 1/2 quart mixing bowl until soft
  peaks form. Then fold into cream cheese buttercream. The consistency
  is soft and thin, but after refrigeration, the cream cheese and fat
  become firm to give the filling body and texture.

           Decoration
           	3/4 c  heavy cream
 
  Whip the heavy cream until soft peaks and slowly closing tracks form.
  Using a flexible metal icing spatula, and holding the cake on the
  palm of the other hand, apply a dab of whipped cream to the side of
  the cake. Without lifting the spatula, spread the frosting away from
  you in a smooth, even stroke, moving forward, around and down. The
  spatula should avoid touching the cake, or it will pick up and spread
  crumbs on the frosting. Scrape the spatula on the edge of the bowl
  between strokes to get rid of excess frosting and crumbs, which could
  make tracks and mar the finish of your final coat.
  
  After the sides have been completely sealed with a thin coat, place
  the cake on a turntable, and apply a thin coat of whipped cream to
  the top. (You never frost the top in your hand because it requires
  different leverage and perspective.) Apply a second coat in the same
  manner as the first,
  
  to smoothly finish the cake. When the top and sides are completely
  covered, spoon the remaining whipped cream into the pastry bag fitted
  with a #4 star or 5A decorating tip, and pipe a swirl in eight places
  on top of the cake. Refrigerate until 1 hour before serving. If
  desired, make caramel sheet. When cool and hard, break off shards and
  stick into each piped swirl to decorate the cake.
  
  Caramel Sheet: 3 tablespoons water
      1/2    cup sugar
  
  Place a strip of aluminum foil onto a baking sheet or line the baking
  sheet with a small silicone mat. Pour water and sugar into a 3 cup
  saucepan or 10 inch skillet. Heat over low heat just until sugar
  dissolves. Raise heat and boil until caramel is amber in color. Pour
  over foil or silicone mat and spread thinly. Allow to cool and harden.

      Title: Lemon Cream Meringue Pie
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Flaky Pie Dough for a 1crust
           Pie, about 10 ounces
           Filling:
      2 c  Milk
    2/3 c  Sugar
      3    To 4 medium lemons
    1/4 c  Cornstarch
      4    Egg yolks
      2 tb Unsalted butter, softened
           Meringue topping:
      4    Egg whites
    2/3 c  Sugar
        pn Salt
 
  To make the filling, combine milk and sugar in a nonreactive saucepan,
  preferably enameled iron. Strip the zest from the lemons with a sharp
  vegetable peeler, making sure you remove the yellow zest but none of
  the white pith beneath. If you do remove some of the white pith,
  scrape it off the strips of zest with the point of a paring knife and
  discard it. Add the zest to the milk and sugar and bring to a simmer
  over low heat. Remove from heat and allow to steep for 5 minutes;
  remove the strips of zest with a slotted spoon or skimmer and discard
  them.
  
  Squeeze lemons to make 1/2 cup strained juice. Place juice in a
  mixing bowl and whisk in cornstarch, then yolks.
  
  Return milk and sugar mixture to a boil over low heat and whisk about
  a third of the boiling milk into the lemon juice mixture. Return
  remaining milk and sugar mixture to a boil once more and whisk the
  lemon juice and yolk mixture back into it, whisking constantly until
  the filling comes to a boil and thickens. Allow to boil, whisking
  constantly, for about 30 seconds. Remove from heat, whisk in butter
  and pour into a nonreactive bowl. Press plastic wrap against the
  surface of the filling and chill until it is approximately 75
  degrees. (If you prepare the filling in advance, let it come to room
  temperature before proceeding.)
  
  Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350
  degrees. Roll out the dough to make bottom crust and arrange in pan.
  Chill crust until firm.
  
  To bake the crust, pierce it all over with the tines of a fork at 1/2
  inch intervals. Line it with a disk of parchment or wax paper and
  fill with cherry stones or dried beans. Bake about 20 minutes, until
  lightly colored. Remove paper and beans and continue baking until the
  crust is a deep golden brown. Cool crust on a rack.
  
  Spread the cooled filling evenly in the cooled crust.
  
  Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees.
  
  To make the meringue bring a small pan of water to a boil. Lower heat
  so that water simmers. Combine egg whites, sugar and salt in the bowl
  of the mixer or if you are using a hand whisk another heatproof bowl.
  Place bowl over pan of simmering water and whisk gently for about 2
  minutes, until egg whites are hot (about 140 degrees) and sugar has
  dissolved. Whip meringue on medium speed until it has cooled and is
  able to hold a shape, but it should not be dry. Distribute spoonfuls
  of the meringue all over the top of the pie, then use the back of a
  spoon or a small offset metal spatula to spread the meringue evenly.
  It should cover the top of the pie and touch the edges of the crust
  all around. Here and there, bring up the surface of the meringue so
  that it is swirled. Place the pie on a cookie sheet and bake for
  about 5 to 10 minutes, until the meringue is colored evenly. Cool on
  a rack.

           Crust pie, above
           Filling:
  2 1/2 c  Milk
    2/3 c  Sugar
        pn Salt
    1/3 c  Cornstarch
      3 lg Eggs
      4 tb Unsalted butter, softened
      2 ts Vanilla extract
      2 lg Bananas, sliced
           Topping:
      1 c  Heavy cream
      2 tb Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  Prepare and bake the crust.
  
  To make the filling, combine 2 cups milk, sugar and salt in a
  nonreactive saucepan; whisk once to mix and bring to a boil over low
  heat. Place remaining 1/2 cup milk in a mixing bowl and whisk in
  cornstarch, then eggs. Return milk and sugar mixture to a boil over
  low heat then whisk about a third of it into the egg mixture. Return
  milk and sugar mixture to a boil once more and whisk in the egg
  mixture, whisking constantly until the filling thickens and comes to
  a boil. Allow to boil, whisking constantly, for about 30 seconds.
  Remove from heat, whisk in butter and vanilla; pour into a
  nonreactive bowl. Press plastic wrap against the surface of the
  filling and chill until it is approximately 75 degrees.
  
  Fold the bananas into the cooled filling and spread it evenly in the
  cooled crust.
  
  To finish the pie, whip the cream with the sugar and vanilla until it
  holds a firm peak. Use a hand mixer on medium speed or a heavy-duty
  mixer fitted with the whisk. Spread the cream over the filling,
  making sure it touches the edges of the crust all around.
  
  COCONUT CREAM PIE: For the 2/3 cup sugar in the filling substitute
  1/3 cup sugar.
  
  Substitute 1/2 cup coconut cream, such as Coco Lopez, for the 1/2 cup
  milk with which the cornstarch is mixed. After the filling has
  cooled, fold in 1/2 cup toasted sweetened coconut. After covering the
  pie with the whipped cream, (you may add up to 1/4 cup coconut cream
  to the cream before whipping it to replace the sugar) sprinkle the
  whipped cream with 1/2 cup toasted sweetened coconut. (To toast
  coconut, place it on a jelly roll pan on the middle rack of a
  preheated 325 degree oven for about 15 minutes. Stir often so that
  the coconut colors evenly to a light golden brown.)

 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      6 oz Large semi-hot dried red
           Chiles, such as New Mexico
           Or Anaheim
           Hot water
      2 ts Mexican oregano
      3    Garlic cloves
      2 c  (approximately) water,
           Chicken stock, or pork
           Stock
      2 tb Lard or vegetable oil
  1 1/2 tb Flour
      1 ts Salt, or to taste
 
  Heat a heavy skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Meanwhile,
  remove stems and seeds from chiles while rinsing under cold running
  water. Place them on a griddle and toast, 3 or 4 at a time, just
  until the aroma is released, 30 to 60 seconds. Be careful not to burn
  them. Place the chiles in a bowl and cover with hot water. Let soak
  until softened, about 10 minutes. Drain chiles and discard liquid.
  Place chiles, oregano, 2 garlic cloves, and 2 cups of water or stock
  in the container of a food blender and process to a smooth puree. Add
  more stock if it is too thick for the blender. With a wooden spoon or
  pusher, work the puree through a sieve into a bowl, pushing and
  scraping to get all the solids blended. You may want to pour in a
  little more liquid to help strain the sauce through the sieve. In a
  heavy medium saucepan, heat lard over medium-high heat until
  rippling. Add remaining garlic clove and brown in the hot fat,
  pressing down with the back of a wooden spoon to release the flavor.
  Remove and discard garlic.
  
  Add flour to the hot lard and cook, stirring constantly, until
  golden. Add the strained chile puree to the pan and reduce the heat
  to low. It will splatter as you pour it in and be careful. Cook over
  low heat, stirring often, until raw taste is gone and flavor of chile
  is mellowed, about 10 minutes. Can be stored tightly covered in
  refrigerator for up to a week or indefinitely in freezer.

 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 lb Fresh Masa (ask for coarsely
           Ground) or 4 1/2 cups Masa
           Harina and
      4    To 5 cups warm Caldo de
           Pollo, plus more as needed
      1 lb Lard (preferably
           Non-hydrogenated and without
           Preservatives)
  2 1/2 tb Salt
 
  If using fresh Masa, set aside. If using Masa Harina, place it in a
  large bowl and reconstitute by adding 4 cups warm stock. Beat with a
  wooden spoon or mix with your hands until you have a stiff, smooth
  dough like a medium-pliable bread dough. Use a little more stock if
  necessary, but the mixture should not be loose. Beat the lard in a
  large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until very fluffy
  and fully aerated, about 3 minutes. It may take longer if your mixer
  is not powerful (a heavy-duty machine such as a Kitchen Aid is best).
  The best alternative to a mixer is not a spoon but your bare hand;
  whip and beat the lard with a rapid folding motion until you feel it
  lightening, and continue to whip until it is fluffy and full of air.
  It should be as light as butter creamed for the lightest butter cake.
  Still mixing on medium speed, begin adding the Masa, a handful at a
  time. Stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula
  as necessary. Alternatively, beat in the Masa using your bare hand as
  a whipping and folding tool. If the mixture becomes too stiff to
  beat, add up to 1 cup tepid chicken or pork stock, a little at a
  time. When all the Masa has been incorporated, the mixture should be
  very light and delicate, the texture of buttercream frosting. Beat in
  the salt. The mixture is now ready to be spread onto corn husks,
  banana leaves, or other wrappers and steamed

      2 c  Cooked or canned pureed
           Pumpkin or winter squash
           (drain slightly if

  1 1/2 ts Ground true Ceylon cinnamon,
           Preferably freshly ground in
           Spice grinder,
           Or1/2 teaspoon ground U.S.
           Cinnamon
      3 oz Piloncillo, grated or
           Crushed, or 1/2 cup firmly
           Packed dark brown
           Sugar
      1 ts Salt, or to taste

      2 ts Aniseed
      2 c  Water
      2    To 2 1/2 cups cooked or
           Drained canned black beans
      2    To 3 canned Chipolte chiles
      5    To 6 garlic cloves, peeled
      2 tb Lard
           Salt, to taste
 
  Unfold the banana leaves, being careful not to split them
  unnecessarily. Wipe them with a clean damp cloth.  With kitchen
  scissors, trim the leaves into 12 to 14 rectangles about 14 by 11
  inches. Save some of the longer trimmings.  Pat dry and set aside.
  
  Place the dough in a large bowl and add the pumpkin, Ceylon cinnamon
  and grated sugar cane or brown sugar and salt, and beat with an
  electric mixer on medium speed until very light and fluffy, stopping
  to scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary.  The mixture,
  should be as light as buttercream.  Make an anise infusion by boiling
  the aniseed in the water until reduced by half.  Strain and reserve.
  Working in batches if necessary, puree the beans in a blender or food
  processor fitted with a steel blade together with the chiles, garlic
  and anise tea.
  
  Heat the lard or vegetable oil in a heavy skillet or wide, shallow
  saucepan over high heat.  When very hot, add the bean puree, watching
  out for splatters.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, uncovered,
  stirring to prevent sticking, until the liquid is evaporated. Season
  with salt. Cool to room temperature.
  
  To fill the tamales, place 1 or 2 banana-leaf rectangles at a time
  flat on the counter. Tear off some long, thin strips from the
  reserved banana-leaf trimmings to use as ties. Place a big handful
  (2/3 to 1 cup) of the Masa (corn mixture) in the center of the leaf.
  With a spatula or your fingers, spread it into an oval about 4 by 3
  inches and 1/2-inch thick. Place about 1 heaping tablespoon of the
  bean filling in the center of the oval.
  
  Fold the right and left edges of the banana leaf toward the center to

           Substitute 2 teaspoons
           Ground

      2 tb Mexican oregano
    1/2    To 1 cup lard
    1/2 c  Sesame seeds
    1/2 c  Dry-roasted unsalted
           Peanuts
    1/2 c  Slivered almonds
    1/2 c  Walnut or pecan meats
    1/2 c  Golden raisins
      1 c  Pitted prunes, sliced
      1 c  Pitted dried apricots,
           Sliced
      1    To 1 1/2 cups sherry,
           Heated
      1    Large, very ripe plantain
      2 tb Butter or lard
    1/2    Head garlic (8 cloves),
           Unpeeled
      1 lg Onion, unpeeled
      1 lb Firm, ripe tomatoes (2 large
           Or 3 to 4 medium)
    1/4 lb Tomatillos
      4    To 5 cups chicken stock, or
           As necessary
      1    (3-ounce) tablet Mexican
           Chocolate
 
  Rinse chiles under cold running water, removing seeds. Heat a griddle
  or cast-iron skillet over high heat until a drop of water sizzles on
  contact. Briefly toast chiles, a few at a time, on griddle, turning
  once or twice, until their aroma is released. Do not let them scorch
  or the dish will be ruined! As chiles are toasted, place in a large
  bowl or saucepan. Cover with boiling water and let soak until
  softened, no more than 10 minutes, while you prepare the spices.
  Drain and reserve. Rinse and dry the griddle, which you will need
  later. Heat a small heavy skillet over medium-low heat. Add
  peppercorns and cloves; toast, shaking pan and stirring constantly,
  until their aroma is released, about 1 minute. Set aside in a small
  bowl. Lightly toast cinnamon in the same pan for about 1 minute; add
  to the peppercorns and cloves. Toast oregano in the same pan until
  fragrant and add to the spices. Set aside while you prepare the nuts.
  In a heavy medium skillet, heat 2 to 4 tablespoons of the lard over
  medium heat until rippling. Add sesame seeds and saute, stirring,
  just until golden, about 3 to 4 minutes; do not let them darken.
  Remove to a medium-sized heat-proof bowl.
  In the same pan, saute peanuts in the same manner, stirring, until
  lightly browned, adding a little more lard. Add to the bowl with
  sesame seeds. Saute the slivered almonds, then the pecans or walnuts,
  by the same procedure, using a little more lard each time and adding
  toasted nuts to the sesame and peanuts. Set aside. Place raisins,
  prunes, and apricots in a bowl and pour hot sherry over them. Set
  aside to soften Peel plantain and cut into 1/2-inch slices. In a
  medium skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of butter or lard until very hot.
  Add plantain slices, and saute until golden on both sides. Set aside.
  Heat griddle or cast-iron skillet over high heat until a drop of
  water sizzles on contact. Place unpeeled garlic and onion on griddle
  and roast, turning several times, until onion is blackened on all
  sides and garlic is dark brown and somewhat softened. Let cool
  slightly. Peel onion and garlic; coarsely chop onion. Set aside. On
  same griddle roast the tomatoes, turning several times until
  blackened on all sides. Place in a deep bowl to catch the juices. Let
  cool slightly and peel. Place tomatillos in a small saucepan and
  cover with water. Bring to a boil and simmer uncovered until the
  color changes, about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.
  Now you are ready to puree the ingredients in sequence, working in
  batches according to the capacity of your blender and adding chicken
  stock as necessary to facilitate the blending.
  Place as many of the drained chiles and toasted spices in a blender
  as it can comfortably accommodate, with about 1 cup chicken stock.
  Process until smoothly pureed, adding more stock if necessary. Repeat
  with remaining chiles and spices. With a wooden spoon or pusher,
  force the puree through a sieve into a bowl; discard whatever will
  not go through. Scrape the puree into a large, heavy saucepan or
  Dutch oven; rinse out blender to wash away any hard or fibrous bits.
  Puree sesame seeds and nuts in several batches with just as much
  chicken stock as necessary to help free the blades. Add to the chile
  puree. Puree dried fruit and sherry along with sauteed plantain in
  the same manner, adding a little stock if necessary. Add to the
  saucepan with chile and nuts. Puree onion, garlic, tomatoes, and
  tomatillos (they may not need added stock). Add to other purees in
  saucepan. Coarsely chop the chocolate and add to pureed ingredients.
  Bring the sauce to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly.
  Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered, stirring often, for
  30 minutes. Serve with chicken (either cooked separately or browned
  in a little hot lard and added to the sauce to finish braising) and
  sauteed sliced plantains. (The mole is also good with turkey). Can be
  stored tightly covered in refrigerator for 10 days or indefinitely in
  freezer.

  chile. Pour oil into a large heavy skillet to a depth of about
  1/2-inch and heat over high heat until very hot but not quite
  smoking. Fry the chiles, 3 at a time, turning once or twice, until
  they puff up and take on an olive-beige color. Remove from pan as
  they are done. Carefully peel chiles under cold running water. Very
  gently pull out seeds through the slit in each chile, being sure not
  to tear the flesh. Set aside. Dice the fresh and dried fruits and set
  aside.
  
  In a large skillet, melt butter or vegetable oil over medium heat
  until very hot and fragrant. Add onion and garlic and saute for 3
  minutes. Add fresh and dried fruit and saute for 3 minutes. Add

      Title: Marinated Ancho Chiles
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 c  Water
  1 1/2 c  Cider vinegar
      4 oz Piloncillo or 1 cup firmly
           Packed dark brown sugar
      5    Cloves
      8    Allspice berries
      8    Black peppercorns
      8 lg Garlic cloves, peeled
      4 oz Ancho chiles (about 8
           Chiles)
 
  Place all ingredients, except the chiles, in a heavy medium saucepan
  and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and
  cook, uncovered, for 20 minutes, until somewhat reduced.
  
  While the marinade is reducing, look over the chiles. If they are very
  brittle, place them in a steamer basket or platform and steam in a
  tightly covered saucepan over boiling water just long enough to make
  them slightly flexible. (Alternatively, wet the chiles slightly and
  place them in a plastic bag; microwave on full power for 30 to 40
  seconds.) With a small sharp knife, make a small (about 1 1/2-inch)
  lengthwise slit in each chile and carefully remove the seeds and
  veins, taking care not to split the chile any more. Rinse under cold
  running water, drain, and add to the boiling marinade. Cook 1 to 3
  minutes until the chiles are soft but not falling apart; the exact
  timing will vary according to the age and condition of the chiles.
  
  Place the chiles and marinade in a nonreactive bowl or container
  (stainless steel, glass, earthenware) and let stand at room
  temperature for at least 3 hours or preferably overnight.
  
  You can drain the chiles and serve them as they are (no need to
  remove the spices). I like to stuff them with different fillings, for
  example; beef, pork or Chicken Picadillo or shredded cheese mixed
  with scallions.

      Title: Schnitzel A La Holstein
 Categories: Emeril
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Two - 4 ounces slices of
           Veal, inside round
           Salt and pepper
           Flour for dredging
           Egg wash for dipping-1 egg,
           Beaten with 1/4 cup milk
           Seasoned bread crumbs, for
           Coating
           Oil for pan frying
      2    Eggs
      4    Anchovies, rinsed
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      1    Lemon, split
      1 tb Chopped parsley
      1 ts Capers, rinsed
 
  Working with one piece of veal at a time, place the veal slice
  between two large pieces of plastic wrap. Using the flat side of a
  meat mallet, pound the meat until 1/4-inch thick, being careful not
  to make any tears in the meat. Repeat with the remaining piece of
  veal. Season the veal with salt and pepper. Dredge in the flour,
  shake off excess. Dip into the egg wash, allow excess to drip off.
  Coat in the bread crumbs.
  
  Heat 3/4 cup of oil in a large skillet until very hot. Place the veal
  pieces into the oil. (A sign of a good schnitzel is when the breading
  "bubbles" up while pan frying.) Cook until golden brown, about 2
  minutes. Flip and cook until golden. Remove and keep warm on a
  service platter. Remove the excess oil from the skillet.
  
  Crack the eggs into the skillet, season and cook perfect sunny side up
  eggs. Place a cooked egg on top of each veal schnitzel. Criss cross
  the egg with 2 anchovies each. In the same pan, brown the butter,
  squeeze in the lemon juice, add the parsley and capers and pour the
  sauce over the entire platter.

  pepper. Leave the batter for 30 minutes, then fold in the egg whites.
  Season all the seafood and vegetables with salt and pepper. Dip each
  piece of seafood in the batter, letting the excess drip off. This
  will be very messy so have plenty of towels on hand. Preheat the oil.
  Fry the fish in batches, starting with the calamari and ending with
  the seabass. You might want to have two stockpots or large skillets
  of oil on to speed up the frying process. After each batch of frying,
  make sure that the oil comes back up to temperature. Dip the
  vegetables in the batter, letting the excess drip off and fry until
  golden brown about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove all fried items from the
  oil and drain on paper-lined plates. Season every item with salt and
  pepper. Spoon the Mariana sauce over the bottom of a large platter.
  Pile the fried seafood and vegetables on top of the sauce. Garnish
  with drizzles of aioli, cheese and parsley.

  This recipe is a two day procedure. Make sure that your butcher
  thoroughly cleans the suckling pig. By cleaning inside and out and
  removes the eyeballs. With a knife make several cuts on the pig's
  skin so the skin doesn't burst during cooking. Prop the pig's mouth
  open with a small yam. Season the entire pig with kosher salt and
  cracked black pepper. Place the pig in a garbage bag and tie the back
  tightly. Place the pig in the refrigerator and chill for 12 hours.
  Remove from the refrigerator and rinse thoroughly. In a mixing bowl
  combine the garlic, parsley, thyme, cumin, bay leaves, onions, juice
  of the orange, lime, lemon, olive oil and wine. Whisk the marinade
  until incorporated. Season with salt and pepper. Place the pig back
  in the bag and pour the marinade over the pig. Tie the back tightly
  and place back in the refrigerator. Turn the pig every three hours.
  Refrigerate the pig for 12 hours. Remove the pig from the
  refrigerator and out of the bag, reserve the marinade. Stuff the
  cavity with the stuffing. Using a kitchen needle and thread, tie up
  the cavity. Tie the front legs and then back legs. Cover the tail
  with aluminum foil. Place the pig on a large roasting pan and pour
  the reserved marinade over the pig. Place the pig in the oven. Roast
  the pig for about 5 hours, basting and turning the pig every hour.
  Remove the pig from the oven and allow the pig to rest for about 30
  minutes before slicing. Yield: about 12 servings

           Baby Romaine
           Red Leaf Lettuce
           Curly Endive

           Pear Vinaigrette:
    3/8 c  Pear vinegar
    1/2 c  Walnut oil
 
  Tender, freshly picked garden greens are the first choice for this
  hearty salad, but limestone, butter, and green leaf lettuces are good
  substitutes. Watercress can be added for a crunchy, tangy contrast to
  milder greens. Select a mild goat cheese, as baking intensifies its
  flavor. To bake goat cheese:  Brush slices with olive oil, coat with
  white and black sesame seeds, and bake at 350 degrees until soft,
  approximately 10 to 15 minutes. In a small bowl, whisk vinegar and
  walnut oil together. Toss vinaigrette with mixed greens and serve
  with baked goat cheese.

      Title: Mansion On Turtle Creek Chocolate Truffles
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8 oz Semisweet or bittersweet
           Chocolate, chopped fine
    1/3 c  Dutch process cocoa powder
      3 oz Unsalted (sweet) butter cut
           Into small pieces
      1    Egg yolk
 
  Place chocolate and butter in a 4 to 6 cup heat-proof bowl. Place
  bowl in a wide skillet of barely
  
  simmering water, over low heat. Stir frequently until chocolate and
  butter are completely melted and smooth. Remove bowl and set aside.
  Leave skillet on low heat.
  
  Place egg yolk in a small bowl. Gradually whisk in 1/4 cup boiling
  water. Place bowl in a skillet and stir constantly with a spoon until
  yolk mixture thickens slightly, to the consistency of half-and-half
  (it will be between 160 to 165 degrees and safe from salmonella).
  Remove yolk mixture from hot water and scrape immediately into melted
  chocolate. Stir gently with a rubber
  
  spatula (do not whisk or beat), just until chocolate and butter are
  completely melted and the mixture is smooth. Pour through a fine
  strainer into a clean bowl. Cover and chill until firm, 2 hours or
  more.
  
  To form truffles, remove truffle mixture from the refrigerator and
  allow to soften about 30 minutes (if mixture is very hard). Pour
  cocoa into a pie plate. Dip a melon baller or small spoon into a
  glass of hot water; wipe off excess water and scrape across surface
  of chilled truffle mixture to form an irregular ball 3/4 inch to 1
  inch in diameter. Pinch the truffle into shape with your fingers, if
  necessary; it should not be perfectly round. Deposit truffle into
  cocoa. Repeat with remaining truffle mixture.
  
  Gently shake pie plate to coat truffles with cocoa. Store truffles
  tightly covered, and refrigerated up to 2 weeks, or freeze up to 3
  months.

      1    Stick (1/2 cup) unsalted
           Butter
      3 lg Egg yolks, beaten lightly
      1 ts Vanilla
      1 c  Pecans, chopped fine and
           Toasted lightly
  1 1/3 c  Sweetened flaked coconut,

      5 tb Unsalted butter, softened
      3 tb Heavy cream
      1 ts Vanilla
      2 oz Unsweetened chocolate,
           Melted and cooled
      2 c  Confectioners' sugar
 
  Make the cake layers: Line the bottoms of 3 buttered 9 by 1 1/2-inch
  round cake pans with rounds of waxed paper, butter the paper, and
  dust the pans with flour, knocking out the excess. In a small metal
  bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water melt the chocolate
  with the water, stirring occasionally, remove the bowl from the heat,
  and let the mixture cool. Into a bowl sift together the flour, the
  baking soda, and the salt. In the large bowl of an electric mixer
  cream together the butter and the sugars until the mixture is smooth.
  Add the buttermilk alternately in batches, beginning and ending with
  the flour mixture, and beat the batter until it is smooth. Mix in the
  melted chocolate. Divide the batter among the prepared pans,
  smoothing the tops, rap each pan twice on a hard surface to expel any
  air bubbles, and bake the layers in the middle of a preheated 350
  degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean.
  Let the layers cool in the pans on racks for 10 minutes, run a knife
  around the edge of each pan, and invert the layers onto the racks.
  Remove the wax paper and let the layers cool completely. The cake
  layers may be made 2 days in advance and kept, wrapped in plastic
  wrap, at room temperature.
  
  Make the filling: In a saucepan combine the cream, the granulated
  sugar, and the butter and cook the mixture over moderately low heat,
  stirring, until the sugar is dissolved. Whisk 1/2 cup of the cream
  mixture into the yolks, whisk the yolk mixture into the remaining
  cream mixture, and cook the mixture over moderately low heat,
  whisking, for 10 minutes, or until it is thickened (do not boil).
  Stir in the vanilla, the pecans, and the coconut and let it cool,
  stirring occasionally.
  
  Make the frosting: In a bowl beat together the butter, the cream, the
  vanilla, the chocolate, and the confectioners sugar until the
  frosting is fluffy.
  
  Assemble the cake: On a cake stand arrange 1 cake layer, spread the
  layer with 3/4 cup of the filling, and top the filling with a second
  layer. Spread the second layer with 3/4 cup of the remaining filling
  and pour the icing on top of the cake, letting it drip down the side
  of the cake.
  
  The cake may be assembled 1 day in advance and kept covered loosely
  and chilled. Let the cake return to room temperature before serving.

      2    Envelopes active dry yeast
      1 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 ts Salt
      8 tb Unsalted butter
      1    Egg
      1    Egg yolk
      2 ts Vanilla extract
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/8 ts Ground nutmeg
      4 c  Unbleached, all purpose
           Flour
           Crumb Topping:
      3 oz Almond paste
      1 lg Egg white
    1/2 c  Light brown sugar
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
     16 tb Unsalted butter
      2 ts Ground cinnamon
      4 c  Unbleached, all purpose
           Flour
 
  For the dough, heat milk in a small saucepan until lukewarm, no more
  then 105 degrees. Sprinkle yeast on surface and whisk in. Set aside.
  
  By machine with paddle attachment, beat together sugar, salt, and
  butter until soft and light. Beat in egg and yolk until smooth.
  Scrape bowl and beater and beat in vanilla and spices. Beat in half
  the flour, then the yeast mixture, then remaining flour, scraping
  bowl and beater between each addition. Continue beating on low speed
  about 2 minutes, until dough is elastic.
  
  Scrape dough into a lightly buttered bowl and cover with plastic wrap.
  Allow to ferment at room temperature until almost double in bulk,
  about 1 hour.
  
  While dough is fermenting, prepare crumb topping. Beat almond paste
  and egg white with paddle until smooth. Beat in sugars, then butter
  until smooth and free of lumps. Beat in cinnamon, then flour,
  scraping bowl and beater occasionally. By hand rub mixture to 1/4-to
  1/2-inch crumbs. Set aside covered.
  
  To form buns, scrape dough to a floured surface and press to deflate.
  Press dough to an 10 by 16-inch rectangle. Cut the dough into twenty
  2 by 4-inch rectangles.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees and set rack in the middle level. Butter
  and line with parchment paper a 12 by 18-inch jelly roll pan. Arrange
  the rectangles of dough 5 across the 12-inch side of the pan and 4
  down the 18-inch length, spacing them evenly. Brush tops of buns with
  water and sprinkle with 3/4 of the crumb topping. Cover the buns with
  plastic wrap and allow to rise until almost double. Sprinkle with the
  remaining crumb topping after the buns have risen.
  
  Bake the buns about 30 minutes, until they are firm and the crumb
  topping has colored. Slide the buns from the pan to a rack to cool.
  When cooled, dust lightly with confectioners' sugar.

    1/2 lb Granulated sugar
    1/2 lb Sweet butter
    1/2 lb All purpose flour mixed with
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 lb Melted cooked bittersweet
           Chocolate
      1    To 2 eggs
      6 oz Seedless raspberry jam
 
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Roast the hazelnuts until they smell
  toasty. Remove from oven and let cool for a few minutes. Rub off the
  skins and cool the nuts another 15 minutes.
  
  In a food processor grind the nuts with the sugar until finely ground
  but not pasty. With your hands work in the butter, flour and chocolate
  together. Add the eggs, one at a time. You just need the egg to hold
  the dough together; you may need only 1.
  
  Butter a 13 1/2 x 5 x 2 1/2 inch deep meatloaf pan. Spread about 2/3
  of dough in the bottom and up the sides of the pan, spread the jam in

      Title: Southern Biscuits
 Categories: Taste
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     12 oz White Lily flour
      1 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Cream of tartar
    3/4 ts Salt
      3 oz Chilled lard
    3/4 c  Buttermilk, 1/4 cup more if
           Necessary
           Flour
 
  Weigh out 12 ounces of flour and put it in a sifter. Add the baking
  soda, cream of tartar and salt. Sift all into a bowl. Weigh out 3
  ounces of chilled lard and break it into 1 inch chunks. Cut the lard
  into the flour with 2 knives or a pastry cutter. Fold in the
  buttermilk in 3 parts. ( Use 1/4 cup more buttermilk if necessary.)
  Only fold in the buttermilk until it's just blended. Work lightly.
  
  Lightly dust the table with flour. (Use as little flour as possible)
  Work the dough with fingertips only until it just holds together.
  Roll out dough 1/2inch thick. Dip biscuit cutter in flour and punch
  out 12 biscuits.
  
  Don't use a glass to punch out the biscuits and don't twist the
  cutter. You need a clean cut that doesn't compress the dough so the
  biscuits will rise easily.
  
  You can stack scraps and roll them out in order to cut more biscuits.
  Put biscuits on ungreased baking sheet.
  
  Put the biscuits close together but not touching. If they're too
  close, the edges won't cook and the biscuits will have a cakey
  texture too far apart and they'll brown too soon and be raw in the
  middle.
  
  Bake at 450 degrees. Until tops are golden brown, about 15 to 17
  minutes.
  
  Yield: 12 or more biscuits

  dough. Wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
  In a large saute pan, over medium heat, melt the butter.  When the
  butter as melted, add the onions, bell peppers, and celery.  Season
  with salt and cayenne. Saute the vegetables until soft, about 6 to 7
  minutes. Stir in the paprika. Add the crawfish tails and cook for 5
  to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally. Dissolve the flour in the water
  and add to the crawfish mixture. Stir for 1 to 2 minutes, or until
  the mixture thickens. Remove from the heat and add the parsley and
  green onions.  Cool to room temperature.  Preheat the oven to 375
  degrees and lightly oil a baking sheet.  Remove the dough from the
  refrigerator and place it on a lightly floured surface. With a knife,
  cut the dough into 8 equal portions. Lightly flour each piece. Using
  your fingers, flatten each piece into a 6-inch round, about 1/4-inch
  thick. Fill the center of each one with 1/3 cup of the crawfish
  mixture. Brush the edges of each round with some of the beaten egg.
  Fold the rounds in 1/2 and crimp the edges with the tines of a fork.
  Brush the tops of the turnovers with the remaining beaten egg.  Place
  the turnovers on the baking sheet about 1-inch apart.  Bake for 45
  minutes or until golden brown.
  
  Yield: 8 turnovers

      1 tb Flour
      1 c  Chopped onions
      1 c  Chopped celery
      3 c  Chicken stock
      2 tb Steen's 100 percent Pure
           Cane Syrup
      3 tb Chopped green onions
      1 tb Chopped parsley
 
  Remove any excess fat pieces from the cavity of the duck. Remove the
  neck flap. With the duck breast side up and the cavity facing you,
  make a 1 inch slit on each side of the breastbone inside the cavity.
  Insert 1 slice of the jalapeno and 1 clove of garlic in each hole.
  With your fingers, separate the skin from the breast meat and insert
  5 pieces of jalapeno and 5 garlic cloves under the skin and push them
  well along the breast. Turn the duck around so that the neck is
  facing you. Slice the remaining 2 cloves garlic and put these and the
  remaining jalapeno slices in the neck cavity. Put the duck in a deep
  glass or plastic container. Squeeze the lemons and pour the juice
  over the duck and inside the cavity. Rub the duck with the lemon
  skins. In a small bowl, stir the sugar with salt, pepper, and
  cayenne. Rub the duck, inside and out, with this mixture. Cover and
  refrigerate for 8 hours. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Remove
  the duck from the container and place it on a rack in a roasting pan.
  Stuff the cavity with the sweet potatoes and head of garlic. Bake for
  30 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F. and continue to bake
  for 1 hour, or until the duck legs pull easily away from the body.
  Carve the duck into 4 pieces. Peel and chop the sweet potatoes.
  Squeeze the garlic from the skin and set aside. Pour the oil (about
  1/2 cup) from the roasting pan into a large skillet and heat over
  medium-high heat for about 2 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon flour and
  blend with a wire whisk for 5 to 6 minutes to make a medium brown
  roux, the color of peanut butter. Add 1 cup each chopped onions and
  celery and cook stirring often, for 5 to 6 minutes. Add the chopped
  sweet potatoes and roasted garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, for
  about 3 minutes. Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Reduce
  the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the
  mixture thickens 6 to 7 minutes. Season with salt, cayenne and the
  Steen's Cane Syrup. Simmer for about 3 minutes. Add the green onions
  and parsley. Lay the duck pieces in the sauce and spoon it over.
  Increase the heat to medium, cover, and cook for about 20 minutes.
  Remove the lid and cook for 5 minutes more. To serve, place a piece
  of duck in the center of each plate and spoon the sauce over the top.

  In a large skillet, over medium heat, fry the bacon until crispy,
  about 3 to 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the bacon and
  drain on a paper-lined plate. Set the bacon aside. Stir the fat into
  the flour and make a medium brown roux, the color of peanut butter,
  by stirring constantly for 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the onions and
  saute for 3 minutes, or until the vegetables start to wilt. Add the
  mushrooms and continue to cook for 2 minutes. Season with salt,
  pepper, and cayenne. Add the garlic and sherry and cook for 2
  minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and chicken stock and bring the liquid
  to a boil. Season the quail with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Add the
  quail to the mixture and simmer for 30 minutes, basting the quail
  every 10 minutes. Stir in the lemon juice and parsley. Serve the
  quail with the Jerusalem Artichoke and Potato Au Gratin and garnish
  with the reserved crispy bacon.

      Title: Basic Pie Dough
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      6 oz Cold unsalted butter, cut
           Into cubes
    1/4    To 1/3 cup ice cold water
 
  To prepare the dough by hand, combine the flour and salt in a
  stainless steel bowl, using a pastry knife mix well.
  
  Add the cold butter cubes to the flour and mix in until the mixture
  begins to resemble a mealy mixture where the butter forms pea sized
  nuggets plainly visible in the flour. Add only enough ice water to
  pull the dough together. The water should be added to the flour
  slowly to ensure that only the minimum amount of water is used. Do
  not over mix the dough. When the dough has been mixed just
  sufficiently to combine the ingredients, form it into a ball and wrap
  in a piece of plastic and refrigerate for several hours.
  
  When ready to use, lightly flour a pastry board and a rolling pin, and
  unwrap the dough. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and begin to
  roll out the first piece into the bottom crust.
  
  Tamp down the dough with the pin and gently begin to roll out into a
  circular pie shape by rolling evenly outward from the center and
  turning the dough in small 1/8th turns to keep the rolling even. When
  the dough is rolled out to an even thickness and is about 12 inches
  and is about 1/8th-inch thick it is ready to be transferred to a
  10-inch pie tin.
  
  Lightly butter the tin, lift the dough with the rolling pin by
  partially rolling the dough up on the pin, center the dough in the
  tin and unroll. Pierce it in several places with the tines of a fork.
  
  Roll the second half of the pie dough into a round shape slightly
  larger than the pie pan. Fill the bottom crust with your chosen fruit
  filling. Cover the filling, such as apple, with the top half of the
  pie dough. Using both hands, crimp the edges of the two crusts
  together to seal. With a sharp knife, make several crosshatch slits
  in the top crust. Brush with the egg wash and bake in a preheated 375
  degree oven for 35 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool for
  20 minutes.
  
  Yield: 2 12-inch pie crusts

 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2    Recipe pie dough (bottom
           Crust only)
      2 pt Huckleberries
      1 c  Granulated sugar
      3 tb Cornstarch
    1/2 ts Grated fresh ginger root
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
           Juice and the grated zest of
      1    Orange
           Juice and grated zest of 1
           Lemon
    1/2 c  Dayold pound cake crumbs
    1/2 c  Chopped pecans
    1/2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      3 ts Ground cinnamon
      1    Stick (8 tablespoons)
           Unsalted butter
 
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Roll the pie dough out to the size
  and shape of a 10-inch pie tin. Lay the dough into the pan and prick
  the bottom with the tines of a fork. Place a sheet of waxed paper
  over the pie dough and weigh it down with pie dough weights or clean
  dry beans, and blind bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes. Remove
  from the oven and cool thoroughly.
  
  Combine the berries, sugar, cornstarch, spices, citrus juice and zest
  in a bowl and mix well. Sprinkle the cake crumbs on the bottom of the
  prebaked pie crust. Fill the pie shell with the berry mixture and
  bake at 375 degrees for 15 minutes.
  
  While the pie is baking, combine the dry ingredients for the pecan
  crunch. Cut the butter into little cubes, add to the dry mixture and,
  with the palms of your hands, rub together to form large nuggets as
  big as peanuts, no larger than walnuts.
  
  After the pie has baked for 15 minutes, sprinkle the crunch all over
  the top, reduce the oven heat to 350 degrees and bake an additional
  45 minutes. If the crunch begins to darken too quickly, cover with
  aluminum foil. Cool the pie for at least an 2 hours before serving.
  
  Yield: 1 10-inch pie

           Quarters
      1    Egg yolk mixed with 2
           TB water
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
  
  Divide the pie dough into two equal pieces. Roll out the bottom crust
  and put into a 10-inch pie dish. Refrigerate until needed.
  
  Roll out the top crust and using a pastry wheel, cut the dough into
  1/2-inch wide strips. Lay these strips on a baking sheet and
  refrigerate.
  
  Combine the water and sugar in a sauce pan large enough to later add
  the rhubarb and, over low heat, begin to cook the syrup. Bring to a
  slow simmer and cook for 2 to 3 minutes before adding the rhubarb
  pieces. Cook the syrup rhubarb for 5 minutes, remove from the heat
  and allow to steep for 20 minutes. Strain out the rhubarb and set
  aside.
  
  Mix the almond liqueur with the cornstarch well (add a few drops of
  water if necessary to remove all lumps) and stir into the cooled
  syrup which is now a wonderful rhubarb color. Place this back on the
  stove and cook the syrup until thick about 5 to 6 minutes.
  
  Return the rhubarb to the and syrup, add the strawberries and stir to
  combine. Remove from the heat and cool completely for 1 hour.
  
  Pour the fruit filling into the pie dish lined with the bottom crust.
  Lay half the strips across the top of the pie, leaving 1/2-inch of
  space between each strip. Brush the strips with the egg wash water
  mix and lay the remaining strips of dough at a 45 degree angle over
  the first strips to create a lattice top. Brush these strips with the
  remaining egg wash.
  
  Place the pie dish on a cookie sheet and put the cookie sheet and pie
  dish setup into the oven on a shelf set in the middle of the oven.
  Bake for 45 minutes, turning the whole setup once so that the pie
  bakes evenly.
  
  Remove from the oven and allow to cool for at least 30 minutes.

      2    Peeled Idaho potatoes
      1 tb Finely chopped chives

      4 oz Goat cheese
      4 c  Loosely packed mixed baby
           Lettuces
      2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
 
  Slice the potatoes into very thin, fine julienne style strips,
  approximately 1 1/2 to 2 inches long by 1/16-inch. Do not wash or put
  the potatoes in water because it would remove the starch which is
  needed to keep the potatoes together. Squeeze all the moisture from
  the cut potatoes and season with salt and pepper.
  
  Add the tablespoon of olive oil to a large skillet. Lay out a thin
  layer of potato, forming a circle (2 1/2-inch diameter). Spread one
  ounce of the goat cheese on the mound of potato, sprinkle with finely
  chopped chives. Cover the goat cheese with another thin layer of
  potato, making sure that the goat cheese is completely enclosed.
  Repeat the same operation, making a total of 4 pancakes.
  
  Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the large skillet and
  over medium heat, let the potato turn into a golden crust on one
  side. Carefully turn the potato pancakes over and cook to a golden
  brown on the other side.
  
  Toss the baby lettuces with the vinaigrette. Arrange the lettuces
  attractively in the center of each of the 4 plates and top each salad
  with a potato and goat cheese pancake.

  will begin to thicken as you are stirring. When entire yolk mixture
  is incorporated into the boiling milk, and the mixture is thick,
  remove from heat. Pour into bowl or container to cool. Dot with a
  little butter while still hot to prevent a skin from forming.

      1    8-inch or 9-inch tart ring
           Or false bottom tart pan
           Cookie sheet
           Parchment paper or aluminum
           Foil
      1    To 2 packages uncooked navy,
           Pinto or similar bean
           Thin slice of plain vanilla
           Cake same size as tart pan
           (optional)
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
           Pastry cream
           Fresh fruit of your choice
           Garnish: Apricot/Grand
           Marnier Glaze, recipe
           Follows
 
  Make shell from pie dough to fit ring or tart pan. Be sure to use pie
  dough that has been completely chilled. IT MUST BE COLD! Chill shell
  after it has been formed before cooking. To cook shell, line cold raw
  shell with parchment paper or aluminum circle that is cut 2 inches in
  diameter larger than ring or pan. Fill lined shell to the brim with
  raw beans. Bake shell at 375 for approximately 30 minutes or until
  light brown. Let shell cool with beans still in place. While shell is
  cooking, prepare the cream filling: Whip heavy cream until stiff. Add
  chilled pastry cream to the whipped cream to taste. Refrigerate until
  ready to use.
  
  Assembly:
  
  Remove beans from thoroughly cooled shell. Save the beans! They can
  be used over and over as weights. Remove cooked shell from ring or
  pan and place on serving platter. Fill shell with cream mixture.
  Place thin slice of plain cake on top of cream. This will help
  prevent heavy fruit from sinking into the pastry cream if the tart is
  made hours in advance. Arrange fruit on top of cake in a design of
  your taste. Garnish with Glaze.

  leave at room temperature until ready to serve. Then reheat on top of
  stove until sugar starts to bubble and then turn out.

      Title: Creme Brulee
 Categories: Baker
      Yield: 4 servings
 
        l  L/2 cups heavy cream
        l  Vanilla bean, split
     11 lg Egg yolks
           L/3 cup granulated sugar
           For the Caramel Sauce:
        l  L/4 cups heavy cream
      4 tb Unsalted butter, cut into
        sm Pieces
      2 tb Light corn syrup
        l  L/2 cups granulated sugar
 
  In a heavy saucepan, combine the cream and the vanilla bean with its
  scrapings. Over low heat, bring to a boil and turn off heat. In a
  medium heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. Place
  over a pan of simmering water and continue to whisk vigorously until
  mixture becomes a very pale yellow and feels hot to the touch.
  
  Remove from heat and turn the cream up to high. It will come to a boil
  quickly because its already hot. Pour the boiling cream into the yolk
  mixture, whisking constantly. Place the bowl over a larger bowl
  half-filled with ice cubes. Stir occasionally until cool. Strain
  through a fine strainer and refrigerate, covered, until ready to use.
  For the Caramel Sauce: In a small saucepan, combine l cup cream with
  butter and heat until butter melts and cream is hot. Keep warm.
  
  Spoon the corn syrup into a medium deep saucepan and top with the
  sugar. On medium heat, cook until mixture turns a deep amber color
  and temperature reaches 225 degrees on a candy thermometer, stirring
  often with a wooden spoon. As the mixture turns golden, check the
  thermometer often. Immediately remove pan from heat and pour cream
  mixture into the sugar, stirring to combine well. Mixture will bubble
  up as you pour, so be careful not to burn yourself. Stir in remaining
  l/4 cup cream. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a heatproof
  bowl. If not using the sauce immediately, let cool and refrigerate,
  covered, until needed. This will keep for weeks in the refrigerator.
  
  Yield: l l/2 cups
  
  Thaw one package of frozen puff pastry sheets or use homemade puff
  pastry. Cut out circles of puff pastry to fit into a six-inch
  tartlette pan. Line the pans with the dough and trim excess. Prick a
  few holes in the bottom of the dough so it wont rise too much. Place
  cut out pieces of parchment paper or coffee filters onto the dough
  and fill with pie weights. Blind bake the shells until done. You can
  lift the parchment paper to make sure it is baked thoroughly. Let the
  shells cool completely before filling.
  
  Slice a few strawberries and lay them down on the bottom of each
  shell. Place a few raspberries or blueberries in the shell. Pour
  enough of the Brulee cream into the shell to reach the top. Repeat
  with remaining shells. Refrigerate the tarts until set, about 3 hours.
  
  Remove from the refrigerator and sprinkle each tart with a little
  granulated sugar. Using a propane torch, caramelize the sugar. Serve
  on a dessert plate with Caramel Sauce or a few extra berries.

      Title: Grandma's Cherry Babka
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter, room
           Temperature
      4    To 5 cups unbleached all
           Purpose flour
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 ts Fine sea salt
  1 1/2 ts Instant yeast
      1 c  Milk
      4    Eggs
      1    Egg yolk
    1/2 c  Dried cherries
           For the topping:
    1/4 c  Fine bread crumbs
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
      4 tb Unsalted butter
      1 lg Egg white, lightly beaten
           Garnish:
           Confectioners' sugar
 
  Grease a 9-inch springform pan with a tablespoon of the butter. Cut a
  strip of parchment paper or aluminum foil measuring about 4 inches
  wide and long enough to fit as a collar around the pan. Set aside.
  
  Place the flour, sugar, salt, and remaining butter in the bowl of a
  food processor fitted with the metal blade. Dissolve the yeast in 1/4
  cup of the milk. Add to the mixture in the processor and process for
  10 seconds.
  
  Combine the remaining milk, eggs, and egg yolk in a small metal bowl.
  Using an instant read thermometer, adjust the temperature of the milk
  and egg mixture so that the combined temperature of the liquid and
  the flour blend gives a base temperature of 130 degrees if using a
  Cuisinart or KitchenAid, or 150 degrees if using a Braun. To warm the
  milk and eggs, place the bowl in another bowl with hot tap water.
  With a wire whisk, stir the mixture until it reaches the desired
  temperature. If the milk and eggs are too warm, cool them by placing
  the metal bowl over ice water. Stir for 2 to 3 minutes or until the
  liquid reaches the desired temperature. With the machine running,
  pour all the liquid through the feed tube. Process for 45 seconds.
  
  Stop the machine and take the temperature of the dough with an
  instant read thermometer, which should read between 75 and 80
  degrees. If the temperature is lower than 75 degrees, process the
  dough for an additional 5 seconds, up to twice more, until the dough
  reaches the desired temperature. If the temperature is higher than 80
  degrees, remove the thermometer, scrape the dough from the food
  processor into an ungreased bowl, and refrigerate for 5 to 10
  minutes. Check the temperature of the dough after 5 minutes; the
  dough should be 80 degrees or cooler by that time. Return the dough
  to the processor, add the dried cherries and pulse for 5 seconds to
  blend them into the dough.
  
  Using a rubber spatula, scrape the dough directly into the prepared
  pan. Wrap the strip of parchment of foil collar around the top of the
  pan, letting it extend at least 3 inches above the rim. Tie the
  collar securely to the pan using a piece of butcher's twine. Cover
  the babka loosely with plastic wrap, then a cloth towel. Let rise for
  1 to 1 1/2 hours in a draft free place at room temperature.
  
  While the babka is rising, prepare the topping. Place the bread
  crumbs, sugar, cinnamon, and butter in the bowl of a food processor
  fitted with the metal blade. Process for 1 minute until all
  ingredients are completely blended. With a spatula, scrape the
  topping into a small bowl and set aside.
  
  Thirty minutes before baking, put the oven rack on the middle shelf
  of the oven. Preheat to 350 degrees. To bake the babka, remove the
  towel and plastic wrap. The babka should have risen and crested the
  top of the pan. If it has not, cover it with plastic wrap and let it
  proof for up to 1 hour longer. Brush the top of the babka with the
  egg white, then sprinkle with the topping mixture.
  
  Using a spray bottle, mist the inside of the oven with water 2 or 3
  times. Place the babka in the oven directly on the center rack. Bake
  for 5 minutes, then spray the oven with water again. Bake the babka
  for about 50 to 55 minutes longer until the cake is golden brown and
  a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Or, it will be
  finished when it reaches an internal temperature of 205 to 210
  degrees on an instant read thermometer.
  
  Remove the babka from the oven and place it on a wire rack to cool
  and rest for 20 minutes. Use a paring knife to loosen it, then remove
  it from the pan. Cut into 2-inch wedges and serve immediately, dusted
  with confectioners' sugar.

      Title: Holiday Stollen
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 c  Candied fruit
    1/2 c  Raisins
    1/4 c  Brandy
      1 c  Plus 2 tablespoons milk
      4    To 5 cups unbleached all
           Purpose flour
      2 ts Instant yeast
    1/4 c  Sugar
      2 ts Fine sea salt
           Few gratings of nutmeg
    1/4 ts Ground allspice
      2 lg Eggs
    3/4 c  Unsalted butter, melted
      1 c  Marzipan
           Garnish:
           Confectioners' sugar
 
  Place the candied fruit and raisins in a small bowl, cover them with
  the brandy, and set aside for 1 hour to 12 hours, preferably
  overnight. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.
  Place 1/2 cup of the milk and 1 tablespoon of the flour in the bowl
  of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Sprinkle the yeast
  over the liquid. Cover the machine and process for 5 seconds to
  blend. Add the remaining flour, sugar, salt and spices to the food
  processor. Pulse 3 to 4 times to incorporate the yeast mixture. Beat
  the eggs in a small metal bowl until blended. Drain the candied fruit
  and raisins, saving the brandy and adding it to the eggs, and setting
  the fruit aside. Add the remaining milk and 1/2 cup of the melted
  butter to the beaten eggs. Using an instant read thermometer, adjust
  the temperature of the egg mixture so that the combined temperatures
  of the flour and the eggs give a base temperature of 130 degrees if
  using a Cuisinart or KitchenAid, or 150 degrees if using a Braun. To
  warm the egg mixture, place the bowl in another bowl with hot tap
  water and stir for 3 to 4 minutes or until the desired temperature is
  reached. If the egg mixture is too warm, cool it by placing the metal
  bowl over ice water and stirring for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the egg
  mixture reaches the correct temperature. With the processor running,
  add the egg mixture. Process for 15 seconds. Stop the machine and
  scrape the sides of the bowl. If the dough sticks to the bottom of
  the bowl and the processor has trouble starting, remove the dough
  form the processor. Return half of it to the bowl, spreading it out
  evenly. Process in two batches, each for another 30 seconds. The
  dough will be soft, but will not cling to the sides of the processor
  bowl. Stop the machine and take the temperature of the dough with an
  instant read thermometer, which should read between 75 and 80
  degrees. If the temperature is lower than 75 degrees, process the
  dough for an additional 5 seconds, up to twice more, until the dough
  reaches the desired temperature. If the temperature is higher than 80
  degrees, remove the thermometer, scrape the dough from the food
  processor into an ungreased bowl, and refrigerate for 5 to 10
  minutes. Check the temperature of the dough after 5 minutes; the
  dough should be 80 degrees or cooler by that time. Scrape the dough
  from the processor onto a lightly floured work surface. Press the
  dough out into a 12-inch square 2 inches thick. Sprinkle the surface
  with half of the drained candied fruit and raisins and roll it into a
  log shape. Fold it in half and knead it for about 2 minutes to
  incorporate the dried fruit. If the dough feels too firm to knead,
  cover it with a towel and let it rest for 10 minutes. Flatten it and
  sprinkle it with the remaining half of the dried fruits. Roll the
  dough and knead it again for 2 minutes, or just enough to distribute
  the fruit throughout. Form the dough into a ball, place it in an
  ungreased bowl, and cover with plastic wrap. Allow it to ferment for
  1 1/2 to 2 hours at room temperature, 70 to 72 degrees. It will have
  doubled in volume. Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured work
  surface and divide it into 2 equal pieces. To form the stollen,
  flatten each piece into an oval about 10 inches long, 8 inches wide,
  and 1-inch thick. Roll half of the marzipan into a smooth log about
  the length of the flattened dough and lay it down the center. Fold
  the dough over and press the edges with your fingertips to seal.
  Repeat with the remaining dough and marzipan. Transfer the loaves to
  the prepared baking sheet, spaced 4 inches apart so that they don't
  stick together when baking. Brush the stollen with part of the
  remaining melted butter.
  Cover with a sheet of plastic wrap and allow the loaves to proof at
  room temperature until the dough has increased by half its size. This
  may take 1 to 1 1/2 hours, depending on the temperature in your
  kitchen. When the dough is ready to bake, it will be puffed but still
  spring back slowly when pressed with a finger.
  One hour before baking, adjust the oven rack so that it is on the
  second shelf from the bottom of the oven. Place the baking stone in
  the oven and preheat it to 400 degrees. Place the baking sheet of
  stollen directly on the baking stone. Reduce the heat to 375 degrees
  and bake the stollen for 35 minutes. Open the oven and rotate the
  baking sheet. Bake the stollen for another 25 to 30 minutes, or until
  the loaves are a deep golden brown. The stollen will be finished when
  it reaches an internal temperature of 205 to 210 degrees on an
  instant read thermometer. Remove the stollen from the oven and
  immediately brush them with the remainder of the melted butter. Allow
  the loaves to cool completely on a wire rack, then dust them heavily
  with confectioners' sugar before serving.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
  3 1/3    To 4 cups unbleached bread
           Flour
      2 ts Fine sea salt
      1 ts Instant yeast
  1 1/4 c  Water
           Cornmeal for the baking
           Sheet
 
  Place the flour, salt, and yeast in a food processor fitted with the
  metal blade. Using an instant read thermometer, adjust the water
  temperature so that the combined temperatures of the water and the
  flour give a base temperature of 130 degrees if using a Cuisinart or
  KitchenAid, or 150 degrees if using a Braun. With the machine
  running, pour all but 2 tablespoons of the water through the feed
  tube. Process for 20 seconds, adding the remaining water if the dough
  seems crumbly and dry and does not come together into a ball during
  this time. Continue mixing the dough another 25 seconds, for a total
  for 45 seconds.
  
  Stop the machine and take the temperature of the dough with an
  instant read thermometer, which should read between 75 degrees and 80
  degrees. If the temperature is lower than 75 degrees, process the
  dough for an additional 5 seconds. If the temperature of the dough is
  still lower than 75 degrees, then process the dough for 5 seconds, up
  to twice more, until it reaches the desired temperature. If the
  temperature is higher than 80 degrees, remove the thermometer, scrape
  the dough from the food processor into an ungreased bowl, and
  refrigerate for 5 to 10 minutes. Check the temperature of the dough
  after 5 minutes; the dough should be 80 degrees or cooler by that
  time.
  
  Remove the dough from the processor and place it in a large ungreased
  bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the dough to ferment
  for 1 1/2 to 2 hours at room temperature, about 70 degrees to 72
  degrees. It will increase in volume somewhat, but don't be concerned
  by how much.
  
  Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. With a dough
  scraper or kitchen knife, shape the dough into a rough ball. Cover
  with a sheet of plastic wrap and let rest for 15 to 20 minutes.
  
  Place the fermented bread dough on an unfloured work surface so it
  can grab the dry surface when rolled. Lightly cup both of your hands
  around the dough. Scoop the palms of your hands under the loaf a few
  times. As the dough stretches, tension will develop on the surface of
  the loaf. While gently pressing down on the piece of dough, use a
  circular motion to roll it along on the table, allowing it to catch
  and drag. Continue rolling until the tension helps the dough form a
  tight ball under your hands. Lightly dust the round shape with flour.
  Roll up your sleeve and press your elbow right into the middle of the
  loaf. Rub and press until your elbow hits the work surface. Press
  your fingers into the indentation in the dough until a hole is formed
  in the center of the dough. Pick up the dough, and turn it between
  your two hands to stretch and enlarge the hole in the loaf. Slide
  your hands into the hole in the dough and rotate the dough around
  them until the hole becomes approximately 6 inches in diameter. Place
  the dough, seam side down, on a floured baking sheet. Cover and proof
  the loaf for 45 minutes to an hour at room temperature, 70 to 72
  degrees.
  
  One hour before baking, put the oven rack on the second shelf from the
  bottom of the oven and place the baking stone on the rack. Place a
  small pan for water on the oven floor. Preheat the oven to 425
  degrees.
  
  Carefully pour about 1 cup of warm water into the pan onto the oven
  floor. Slash the loaf, then slide the couronne from the peel or the
  back of the baking sheet onto the baking stone in the oven. Bake it
  at 425 degrees for about 40 to 45 minutes.
  
  Remove the bread form the oven and immediately place the loaves on a
  wire rack to cool completely before storing.

      Title: Queen Of Sheba
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      6 oz Bittersweet or semi-sweet
           Chocolate, cut into bits
      6 oz Sweet butter, cut into
           Pieces
      3 tb Brandy
    1/8 ts Almond extract
      4 lg Eggs, separated
    3/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  (2 ounces) ground blanched
           Almonds
    1/4 c  (1-ounce) flour
    1/8 ts Cream of tartar
           Bittersweet Chocolate Glaze,
           Recipe follows
      1 oz White and/or milk chocolate
           (optional) for marbling the
           Glaze
    1/2 c  Sliced toasted almonds
           Special Equipment:
      8    Inch corregated cake circle
 
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line the bottom of 8x3-inch springform
  pan with waxed or parchment paper. Melt chocolate and butter in a
  small bowl placed in a barely simmering waterbath, stirring
  occasionally until melted and smooth. Remove from heat. Or microwave
  on medium (50 percent) power for about 2 minutes. Stir until smooth
  and completely melted. Stir in brandy and almond extract. Set aside.
  
  In a bowl, whisk egg yolks with 1/2 cup of sugar until pale and
  thick. Stir in chocolate mixture. Set aside.
  
  In a clean, dry mixer bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar at
  medium speed until soft peaks are formed. Gradually sprinkle in the
  remaining 1/4 cup sugar, beating at high speed until stiff but not
  dry. Set aside just long enough to stir the warm chocolate mixture,
  nuts and flour, into the reserved egg yolk mixture. Finally, fold
  about one-fourth of whites into the batter to lighten it. Fold in the
  remaining whites. Turn the batter into the prepared pan and bake 40
  to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick or wooden skewer plunged into the
  center of the torte shows moist crumbs. Cool completely in the pan on
  a rack.
  
  Torte will rise like a souffle during baking, then fall in the center
  as it cools, leaving a faintly crusty higher rim around the edges.
  Level the torte before removing it from the pan, as follows: Run a
  small metal spatula or knife between the edges of the torte and the
  sides of the pan to release it. Press the raised edges of the torte
  down with your fingers until it is level with the center. Place
  cardboard cake circle on the torte. Release the sides of the pan and
  invert the torte so that the bottom becomes the top, then remove the
  pan bottom and paper liner. If the torte is still uneven or appears
  slightly sunken in the center, level it again by pressing the top
  firmly with the bottom of the empty cake pan. Wrap well and store at
  room temperature up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months. Bring to
  room temperature before serving, glazing, or decorating.
  
  Glaze with Bittersweet Chocolate Glaze, plain or marbled and sliced
  toasted almonds. Store and serve at room temperature.

      Title: Bittersweet Chocolate Glaze
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      6 oz Bittersweet or semisweet
           Chocolate, cut into pieces
      4 oz Sweet butter, cut in pieces
      1 tb Light corn syrup
 
  Place chocolate, butter, and corn syrup in a small bowl. Melt gently
  in a water bath over low heat, stirring frequently until almost
  completely melted. Remove glaze from water bath and set aside to
  finish melting. Stirring once or twice until glaze is perfectly
  smooth. Or, melt in a microwave on medium (50 percent) for about 2
  minutes. Stir mixture gently with a spatula or a wooden spoon until
  completely smooth; do not whisk or beat. Cool glaze, without
  stirring, until nearly set and the consistency of easily spreadable
  frosting.
  
  To Glaze the Torte: Use a metal icing spatula to spread about
  one-fourth of the glaze in a thin layer all over the torte. Smooth
  the rough surface of the torte, securing loose crumbs and filling any
  cracks. This "crumb coat" will not be glossy or attractive. Its sole
  purpose is to provide a smooth, even, undercoat for the final glaze.
  Be careful not to get any crumbs in the remaining glaze. Refrigerate
  torte for about 10 minutes, or just until the crumb coat is set. Do
  not refrigerate for more than 10 minutes--if torte becomes cold
  through and through, it will dull the final glaze.
  
  Rewarm the remaining cooled glaze by placing the bowl in a barely
  simmering water bath for a few seconds, stirring gently until glaze
  is perfectly smooth, 90-92 degrees, and the consistency of heavy
  cream. Do not overheat. If glaze is accidently overheated, cool it
  down again to the proper temperature before using. If there are any
  crumbs or air bubbles in glaze, pour it through a fine strainer just
  before using.
  
  Center the crumb coated torte on a platter or turntable. Have ready a
  clean, dry metal icing spatula. Pour all of glaze in the center of
  the top of the torte. Working quickly, use just 2 or 3 spatula
  strokes to spread the glaze over the top of the torte so that it runs
  down over all sides. Turn platter or turntable as you spread. Use the
  spatula to scoop up excess glaze and touch it to any bare spots on
  the sides of the cake. Tiny bare spots can be fixed by dipping a
  finger into the excess glaze and touching the bare spots. Jiggle, or
  tap the turntable gently to settle uneven glaze or spatula tracks. Do
  not respread or resmooth once glaze has started to set or the
  finished torte will show spatula marks and dull streaks.
  
  Once the torte is glazed, slide a wide spatula under it and remove it
  to a rack to dry at room temperature. Keep the torte as level as
  possible while you lift and transfer it so that the wet glaze on the
  top won't shift before it sets. Glaze will set in 10-20 minutes.
  Press toasted nuts against the sides before the glaze has completely
  dried.

    1/8 ts Cream of tartar
    1/2 c  Plus 1/2 tablespoon
           Unsweetened Dutch Process
           Cocoa
      2 tb All purpose flour
    2/3 c  Plus 1/4 cup sugar
  1 1/4 c  (or more) Raspberry Sauce,
           Recipe follows
           Enlightened Creme Fraiche,
           Optional, recipe follows
 
  Equipment: 8 inch round cake pan, 1 1/2 to 2 inches deep (no
  springform) Baking pan at least 2 inches deep and large enough to
  hold the cake pan
  
  Position the rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350
  degrees. Line the bottom of 8 inch round cake pan with a round of
  parchment paper and grease pan sides with vegetable oil of butter.
  Put a kettle of water on to boil.
  
  Place the chocolate in a large mixing bowl. Combine 1 whole egg and 1
  yolk in a small bowl with vanilla. Place the 2 egg whites in a medium
  bowl with cream of tartar. Set all 3 bowls aside.
  
  Combine the cocoa, flour and 2/3 cup sugar in a 1-1 1/2 quart
  heavy-bottomed saucepan. Whisk in enough of the milk to form a smooth
  paste. Mix in the remaining milk. Cook over medium heat, stirring
  constantly with a wooden spoon to prevent burning (especially around
  the bottom edges of the pot), until mixture begins to simmer. Simmer
  very gently, stirring constantly, for 1 1/2 minutes. Pour the hot
  mixture immediately over the chopped chocolate. Stir until chocolate
  is completely melted and smooth. Whisk in egg and vanilla mixture.
  Set aside.
  
  Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar at medium speed until soft
  peaks form. Gradually sprinkle in the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar,
  beating at high speed until stiff but not dry. Fold a quarter of the
  egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it. Fold in
  remaining egg whites. Scrape mixture into the cake pan and smooth the
  top. Set cake pan in baking pan and place on oven rack. Pour enough
  boiling water into the baking pan to come a third to halfway up the
  sides of the cake pan.
  
  Bake for exactly 30 minutes. The surface of the cake will spring back
  when gently pressed but cake will still be quite gooey inside. Remove
  cake pan and water pan from oven. Remove cake pan from water and cool
  completely on a rack. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate
  overnight before serving. Refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze up to 2
  months.
  
  To serve slide a thin knife around the sides of the pan to release
  cake. Place a piece of waxed paper on top of cake. Invert a plate on
  top of the wax paper and invert cake onto plate. Remove pan and peel
  away paper liner. Turn cake right side up again and remove wax paper.
  Cut with a sharp knife dipped in hot water and wiped dry before each
  slice. Serve with Raspberry Sauce and Enlightened Creme Fraiche, if
  desired.

           Curd cottage cheese
      8 oz "1/3 Less Fat than Cream
           Cheese" Neufchatel Cheese
           (Kraft in the

           Kind in the tub)
      3    Eggs
      1 c  Plus 1 tablespoon sugar
      1 tb Vanilla extract
  1 1/2 ts Strained lemon juice
    1/4 ts Salt
      3 tb Unsweetened Dutch Processed
           Cocoa
    1/4 ts Instant coffee or espresso
           Powder*
      3    4 tablespoons graham cracker
           Or Zwieback crumbs or
           Crushed Chocolate
           Cookies
 
  Special Equipment: 8 inch round pan with a solid bottom (no
  springform), at least 2 inches deep. Ovenproof baking dish or
  skillet, at least 11 inches in diameter and 2 inches deep. 8 inch
  cardboard cake circle or pan bottom, optional
  
  Position rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 350 degrees.
  Place a round of parchment paper in the bottom of the cake pan, and
  spray sides of pan with vegetable oil spray. Put water kettle on to
  boil.
  
  Process the cottage cheese in a food processor for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes
  or until silk smooth, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl once
  or twice as necessary. Set aside.
  
  In a small microwave safe bowl, soften the Neufchatel cheese in
  microwave on high for about 30 seconds. Or, warm gently in the top of
  a double boiler. Stir until smooth. Scrape into the processor. Add
  the eggs, 1 cup of the sugar, vanilla, lemon juice, and salt. Pulse
  until incorporated and perfectly smooth. Do not over process.
  
  In a small bowl, whisk cocoa, coffee powder, and the remaining
  tablespoon of sugar with 3 tablespoons water, until smooth. Stir one
  cup of the cheesecake batter into chocolate mixture. Set aside. Pour
  the plain batter into the prepared pan. Pour the chocolate batter in
  a wide ring leaving a bull's eye of plain batter showing in the
  center and a border of plain batter around the edges. Using a table
  knife or teaspoon, use circular strokes to marble the batters until
  nicely but not too completely mingled.
  
  Slide oven rack part way out. Place cheesecake pan in baking dish or
  skillet and set on oven rack. Carefully pour boiling water around the
  pan to a depth of about 1 inch. Slide oven rack in gently to avoid
  sloshing. Bake until cheesecake has puffed and risen slightly and is
  just beginning to shrink from the edges of the pan, about 40-45
  minutes. Remove cheesecake from water bath and cool on a rack. When
  completely cool, cover and chill for at least 12 hours or up to 2
  days before serving. To unmold and serve: Cover the pan with tightly
  stretched plastic wrap. Place a flat dish on top of plastic. Invert
  pan and dish and rap pan gently until cheesecake is released from
  pan. Remove pan and peel parchment liner from bottom of cake. Place
  cake circle or serving plate on the cake and carefully invert so that
  cake is right side up. Remove plastic wrap. Press crumbs around sides
  of cake. Cut with a sharp thin knife. Dip the knife in hot water and
  wipe it dry between cuts.
  
  Yield: 10-12 servings
  
  Tips: The suave texture of this cheesecake relies on ultra smooth
  cottage cheese. This requires a food processor and at least 2 1/2-3
  minutes of processing, no cheating.
  
  Once the Neufchatel Cheese has been added, pulse only enough to
  incorporate. Overprocessing thins the batter.
  
  If you use nonfat cottage cheese instead of lowfat, the results will
  not be nearly as good and you would save only about .4 grams of fat
  per serving. It's not worth it.

  top if necessary.
  
  Bake 30-35 minutes or until toothpick or wooden skewer plunged into
  the center comes out with a few moist crumbs clinging to it. Cool in
  the pan, on a wire rack. Torte will sink like a souffle; top will be
  uneven.
  
  Taking care not to break the edges of the torte, slide a small knife
  between the tort and the pan and run it around the pan to release the
  cake completely. Invert cake and remove pan and paper liner. Turn
  right side up on cardboard circle or platter. Or, simply serve on the
  bottom of the springform pan. Torte may be completed to this point
  and stored, wrapped airtight one day in advance of serving. Or,
  freeze up to two months. To serve, sieve powdered sugar over the top.

      Title: Coconuts: Opening, Grating And Liquado
 Categories: Toohot
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2    Mediumsize fresh coconuts
      4    5 cups of milk (depending on
           The amount of grated
           Coconut)
 
  Opening Coconuts:
  
  Open the coconuts by flinging them onto a cement or rock surface
  (this is how the monkeys do it!) Don't worry about losing the liquid,
  as it's not the coconut milk called for in cooking. Each coconut
  should break in 3 to 4 pieces. It is also possible to open a coconut
  by piercing the eyes of the coconut with a screwdriver or ice pick,
  draining the liquid through the holes and placing the coconut in a
  400 degrees F oven for 20 minutes. Wrap the coconut in a towel and
  hit it with a hammer to loosen the shell and split it into pieces.
  
  Pry out the white meat and then pare off the dark skin.
  
  Grating Coconut Meat:
  
  To grate the white meat, put the meat through the grating disk of a
  food processor or use a hand grater. You should get about 7 cups of
  grated coconut from the two coconuts, which will keep in the
  refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.
  
  Reserve 4 cups of the grated coconut for the pie crust and filling.
  
  Coconut Liquado:
  
  To make the coconut milk, combine the remaining 3 to 4 cups of loosely
  packed grated coconut with the milk (use 3/4 cup of coconut for each
  1 cup of milk) in a heavy saucepan. Heat slowly, bring to a simmer,
  then remove from the heat and cool. Strain the milk, pressing down on
  the coconut meat to extract all the liquid. Squeeze all the coconut
  through a towel to get any last drops. Discard the coconut.
  
  Yield: about 4 cups grated coconut and about 3 cups coconut milk

      Title: Shrimp In Coconut Milk
 Categories: Toohot
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Large shrimp, peeled and
           Deveined, shells reserved
      3    To 4 sprigs fresh thyme
      2    Bay leaves
      2 tb Black peppercorns
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      1 lg Onion, finely chopped
      3    Scallions, finely chopped
      1 ts Coarse salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      3    Cloves garlic, crushed
      3 md Tomatoes, peeled, seeded and
           Chopped
      2 ts Aji
  1 1/2 c  Coconut milk
           Juice of 6 limes
  1 1/2 c  Peas, fresh or frozen
 
  Place the shrimp shells in a saucepan, along with the thyme, bay
  leaves and peppercorns. Add 3 cups of water, bring to a boil, reduce
  the heat and simmer until reduced by a third, about 30 minutes.
  Strain the liquid (you should have about 1 cup) and discard the
  shells.
  
  Heat the oil in a large skillet over moderate heat. Add the onion,
  scallions, salt and pepper and saute until soft, about 3 to 5
  minutes. Add the garlic, tomatoes, aji and reserved shrimp stock and
  simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the coconut milk,
  shrimp, lime juice and peas, and cook until the shrimp are pink and
  just cooked, turning the shrimp once as they cook, about 3 minutes.
  Serve over white rice.

      Title: Double Coconut Pie
 Categories: Toohot
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 c  Grated coconut
      4 tb (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
      2 oz Semisweet chocolate
    3/4 c  Sugar
      4 tb Cornstarch
    1/4 ts Salt
      3 c  Milk
      4    Egg yolks, beaten
      4 tb (1/2 stick) butter,
           Softened
      2 ts Vanilla extract
      1 c  Heavy cream, whipped
           (optional)
 
  For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350F. Spread the grated coconut in
  a shallow pan or baking sheet. Place in the oven for 1020 minutes
  (fresh takes longer than packaged), stirring frequently, until
  lightly browned. Remove from the oven and let cool. Remove 1 1/2 cups
  of the toasted coconut for the filling.
  
  Meanwhile, in a small saucepan melt the butter with the chocolate.
  
  Combine the remaining 2 1/2 cups of toasted coconut with the melted
  butter chocolate mixture. Refrigerate for 15 minutes, stirring every
  5 minutes, until the mixture begins to firm up. Pat the mixture into
  a 9 inch glass pie plate and chill again for at least 30 minutes
  before filling.
  
  For the filling: Combine the sugar, cornstarch and salt in a medium
  saucepan and whisk until they are thoroughly mixed and powdery
  looking. Continue whisking while adding the milk, first by droplets,
  then in a steady stream. Whisk in the egg yolks until completely
  incorporated.
  
  Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook the mixture, stirring
  constantly with a whisk or spoon, until it boils. Be sure to reach
  all over the bottom and sides of the pan with the whisk or spoon to
  prevent lumps from forming. When it reaches a full boil, reduce the
  heat to low and continue cooking and stirring for 3 minutes. Remove
  from the heat and beat in the butter, vanilla and 1 cup of the
  reserved toasted coconut.
  
  Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pudding,
  covering it entirely to prevent a skin from forming on the surface.
  Let cool for 15 minutes. Remove the plastic, stir well and pour the
  mixture into the pie shell. Whip the cream (if using) just before
  serving and spread it over the pie. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of
  toasted coconut over the finished pie.
  
  Yield: 1 9 inch pie

 Categories: Toohot
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Lard
  2 1/2 tb Unsalted butter
    1/2 ts Sea salt
           About 1/2 cup iced water
           FILLING:
      1 lb Lean ground beef
      1 md Onion, chopped
      2    Cloves garlic, chopped
    1/3 c  Toasted almonds coarsely
           Chopped
    1/3 c  Dark raisins
      8    Italian Roma tomatoes
      2    To 4 serrano chilies
           Juice of 2 limes
  1 1/2 ts Sea salt
      1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1 ts Ground cumin
    1/8 ts Ground cloves
    1/8 ts Cinnamon
           Sea salt, to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper,
           To taste
 
  Dough: In a large bowl, combine the flour with the lard, butter, and
  salt. Mix lightly with your fingertips until the dough forms
  grapesized pieces. You should still be able to see streaks of fat.
  Stir in the water. Lightly knead, handling the dough as little as
  possible, until the dough forms a ball. Add a little more water if
  needed. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, then remove and let it
  return to room temperature, about 1 hour, before rolling. The dough
  can be frozen for as long as a week. Pinch off about half the dough.
  Roll out, on a floured surface, to a thickness of 1/8inch. Cut out
  3inch circles. Then, gather the scraps, add to the rest of the dough,
  and roll out another batch of circles. Repeat, with the rest of the
  scraps. This should be enough dough for about 24 empanadas. Filling:
  In a large heavy skillet, over a mediumhigh heat, saute the ground
  beef until the meat is browned, about 6 to 8 minutes. Drain off the
  excess fat. Add the onion and saute 2 minutes. Then add the garlic,
  almonds, and raisins, and saute 1 minute. Place the tomatoes,
  chilies, lime juice, salt, and pepper in a blender and puree until
  smooth. Add the puree, cumin, cloves, cinnamon and salt and pepper to
  the skillet and cook for about 5 minutes to get rid of any excess
  liquid. Cool. Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each
  circle of pastry. Fold over the pastry and seal the edges. Let the
  empanadas rest in the refrigerator 1/2 hour or freeze immediately.
  (Bake the frozen empanadas without defrosting.) Empanadas may be
  glazed (1 egg and 2 tablespoons milk, well beaten) and baked until
  golden in a 400 degree oven, for about 15 minutes. Or they may be
  deepfried in oil at 375 degrees until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes a
  side. (If you deepfry them, make sure the edges are well sealed so
  the filling won't leak.)

  and set aside.
  
  In a small bowl, combine 1 cup of the Brazil nuts with the flour and
  set aside. Reserve the remaining nuts for the garnish.
  
  In another bowl, beat the egg whites until foamy. Sprinkle in the
  salt and continue beating until soft peaks form. Alternate folding in
  the nut and flour mixture, and the beaten yolk mixture, until
  combined. Pour into the prepared pan.
  
  Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until lightly browned. Set on a rack to

  oranges and cut between the membranes to remove the sections. Remove
  the seeds. Arrange the sections over the cake. Pour the juice through
  a strainer and drizzle over the cake.
  
  In mixing bowl, whisk the egg whites until foamy. Gradually add the

      Title: My Favorite Brisket
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 ts Salt
           Freshly ground pepper to
           Taste
      1    5-pound brisket of beef,
           Shoulder roast of beef,
           Chuck roast or end of
           Steak
      1    Garlic clove, peeled
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      3    Onions, peeled and diced
      1    10-ounce can of tomatoes
      2 c  Red wine
      2    Celery stalks with leaves,
           Chopped
      1    Bay leaf
      1    Sprig fresh thyme
      1    Sprig fresh rosemary
    1/4 c  Chopped parsley
      6    To 8 carrots, peeled and
           Sliced on the diagonal
 
  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
  
  Sprinkle the salt and pepper over the brisket and rub with garlic.
  Sear the brisket in the oil and then place, fat side up, on top of
  the onions in a large casserole. Cover with the tomatoes, red wine,
  celery, bay leaf, thyme, and rosemary. Cover and bake in preheated
  oven for about 3 hours, basting often with pan juices. Add the
  parsley and carrots and bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes more or until
  the carrots are cooked. To test for doneness, stick a fork in the
  flat (thinner or leaner end of the brisket). When there is a light
  pull on the fork as it is removed from the meat, it is "fork tender."
  
  This dish is best prepared in advance and refrigerated so that the
  fat can be easily skimmed from the surface of the gravy. Trim off all
  the visible fat from the cold brisket. Then place the brisket, on
  what was the fat side down, on a cutting board. Look for the grain
  which is the muscle lines of the brisket. With a very sharp knife,
  cut across the grain.
  
  When ready to serve, reheat the gravy. Put the sliced brisket in a
  roasting pan. Pour the hot gravy on the meat, cover, and reheat in a
  preheated 350 degree oven for 45 minutes. Some people like to strain
  the gravy, but I prefer to keep the onions because they are so
  delicious. Serve with farfel (boiled egg barley noodles), noodle
  kugel or potato pancakes. A colorful winter salad goes well with this.

      Title: Crispy Traditional Potato Pancakes Served With Rose Zawid
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Russet (baking) or Yukon
           Gold potatoes
      1 md Onion
    1/2 c  Chopped scallions, including
           The green part
      1 lg Egg, beaten
           Salt and freshly ground
           Pepper to taste
           Vegetable oil for frying
 
  Peel the potatoes and put in cold water. Using a grater or a food
  processor coarsely grate the potatoes and onions. Place together in a
  fine-mesh strainer or a tea towel and squeeze out all the water over
  a bowl. The potato starch will settle to the bottom; reserve that
  after you have carefully poured off the water. Mix the potato and
  onion with the potato starch. Add the scallions, egg, and salt and
  pepper.
  
  Heat a griddle or non-stick pan and coat with a thin film of
  vegetable oil. Take about 2 tablespoons of the potato mixture in the
  palm of your hand and flatten as best you can. Place the potato
  mixture on the griddle, flatten with a large spatula, and fry for a
  few minutes until golden. Flip the pancake over and brown the other
  side. Remove to paper towels to drain. Serve immediately. You can
  also freeze the potato pancakes and crisp them up in a 350 degree
  oven at a later time.

      Title: Chanukah Jelly Doughnuts
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2    Scant tablespoons (2
           Packages) active dry yeast
      4 tb Sugar, plus sugar for
           Rolling
    3/4 c  Lukewarm water or milk
  2 1/2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
           Sifted
      2 lg Egg yolks
        pn Salt
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
  1 1/2 tb Unsalted butter or parve
           Margarine, at room
           Temperature
           Vegetable oil for
           Deep-frying
    1/2 c  Plum, strawberry or apricot
           Jam
 
  Sprinkle the yeast and 2 tablespoons of the sugar into the water or
  milk and stir to dissolve. Place the flour on a work surface and make
  a well in the center. Add the yeast mixture, egg yolks, salt,
  cinnamon, and the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. Knead well, about 5
  minutes, working the butter or margarine into the dough and kneading
  until the dough is elastic. You can also use a food processor fitted
  with the steel blade to do this, processing about 2 minutes. Put the
  dough in a greased bowl, cover with plastic, and let it rise
  overnight in the refrigerator.
  
  Sprinkle flour on the work surface. Roll out the dough to an 1/8-inch
  thickness. Using a 2-inch cookie cutter or floured drinking glass,
  cut out circles. Let the dough circles rise 15 minutes more. With
  your hands, gently form the dough circles into balls. Pour 2 inches
  of oil into a heavy pot and heat until very hot, about 375 degrees.
  Slip the doughnuts into the oil, 4 or 5 at a time, using a slotted
  spoon. Turn them when brown, after a few minutes, to crisp on the
  other side. Drain on paper towels.
  
  Using a turkey baster or an injector available at cooking stores,
  inject a teaspoon of jam into each doughnut. Then roll all of them in
  granulated sugar and serve immediately. You can make larger doughnuts
  if you like.

      Title: Touch-Of-Grace Biscuits
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Nonstick cooking spray
  1 1/2 c  Southern self-rising flour
    1/8 ts Baking soda
    1/3 ts Salt
      1 tb Sugar
      3 tb Shortening
      1    To 1 1/4 cups buttermilk or
    3/4 c  Buttermilk and 1/2 cup heavy
           Cream
           Or whipping cream
      1 c  Bleached all-purpose flour
           For shaping
      2 tb Butter, melted
 
  Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (246 degrees C) and spray an 8-inch
  round cake pan with non-stick cooking spray. Combine the self-rising
  flour, soda, salt, and sugar in a medium mixing bowl. With your
  fingers or a pastry cutter, work the shortening into the flour
  mixture until there are no shortening lumps larger than a big pea.
  Stir in the buttermilk and let stand for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour the cup
  of all-purpose flour onto a plate or pie tin. Flour your hands well.
  Spoon a biscuit-sized lump of wet dough into the flour and sprinkle
  some flour over the wet dough to coat the outside. Pick the biscuit
  up and shape into a soft round. At the same time, shake off the
  excess flour. As you shape each biscuit place into the pan. Push the
  biscuits tightly against one another so that they will rise up and
  not out. Continue shaping until all of the dough is used. To make a
  large batch of biscuits in a hurry, spray a medium-small (about
  2-inch) ice cream scoop with non-stick cooking spray. Cover a
  jelly-roll pan with all purpose flour. Quickly scoop biscuits onto
  the flour, sprinkle with flour, shape and place in small pans. Brush
  the biscuits with melted butter and bake until lightly browned (15 to
  20 minutes). Cool for 1 to 2 minutes in the pan, then dump out and
  cut the biscuits apart. Split the biscuits in half, butter or spread
  with Cherry Chambord Butter.

 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2    3-pound free-range chickens
           Or fryers
           Salt to taste
           The Mansion on Turtle Creek
           Pepper Mixture, to taste,
           Recipe follows
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 c  Finely ground pecans
      1 tb Dijon mustard
      1 tb Pure maple syrup
      1 tb Reserved chicken grease
      1    Lightly beaten egg white
      2 tb Brandy
  1 1/2 c  Brown veal demi-glace
           Roasted Garlic Potatoes
           Cranberry-Orange Relish in
           Sweet Potato Cups
 
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
  
  Remove wings from chickens. Starting at keel bone, run the tip of a
  knife between breast meat and bone back to the thigh so that boneless
  breast and thigh meat separate in one piece. Leave skin on. Cutting
  from underside, remove thigh and leg bones. Repeat for other bird so
  that you have 4 boneless half chickens.
  
  Season chickens with salt and Pepper Mixture. Heat oil in an ovenproof
  saute pan large enough to hold chicken halves in a single layer. Saute
  chicken, skin side down, for about 5 minutes or until a light brown
  crust has formed, being careful not to burn.
  
  Turn halves skin side up and place saute pan in preheated 400 degree
  oven. Roast the birds for 8 minutes, then remove from oven. Pour off
  grease, reserving 1 tablespoon.
  
  Combine pecans, mustard, maple syrup, reserved chicken grease, egg
  white, and salt to taste.
  
  Spoon mixture over each bird. Using the back of a spoon, cover skin
  with a thin coating. Return pan to oven for about 8 minutes or until
  chicken is crispy and juices run clear.
  
  Remove from oven. Place chicken on a warm platter. Pour excess fat
  from saute pan. Over high heat, deglaze pan with brandy. Cook just
  until aroma of alcohol burns off. Stir in demi-glace. Reduce heat and
  simmer for 5 minutes.
  
  Cover the bottom of each of four hot dinner plates with pan sauce.
  Carefully place one chicken half on each. Do not break crust.
  
  Using a pastry bag with a large star tip, pipe 2 swirls of Roasted
  Garlic Potatoes on each side of the chicken, forming small mounds.
  (If pastry bag is not available, make small mounds with a rounded
  tablespoon.) Garnish the plates with Cranberry-Orange Relish in Sweet
  Potato Cups. Serve immediately.

  pan. When the broccoli begins to sizzle, add 1 tablespoon of the
  butter and half the garlic to each pan. Cook just until the garlic is
  light brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the broccoli over and reduce the

  and simmer until reduced to 2 cups or thick enough to coat the back
  of a spoon. Stir occasionally as demi-glace cools to keep it from
  separating.
  
  Demi-glace will keep up to 1 week in the refrigerator or for 2 to 3
  months in the freezer, tightly sealed. For ease of use, store
  demi-glace in small quantities.

      Title: Raspberry Almond Truffle Tart
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/3 c  (1 1/2 ounces) blanched
           Slivered almonds
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Vanilla
    1/8 ts Almond extract
      1 c  Less 2 tablespoons
           All-purpose flour
           Scant 1/4 teaspoon salt
  6 1/2 tb Cold unsalted butter
  2 1/2 ts Water
           Filling and Finish:
  1 1/2 c  Red current jelly
      2 ts Sugar
    2/3 c  Heavy cream
      6 oz Good quality bittersweet or
           Semisweet chocolate,
           Chopped
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      2 ct Fresh red raspberries
           Bittersweet chocolate
           Shavings
           Powdered sugar for dusting
           Special equipment:
           Food Processor
      9    Inch fluted tart pan with
           Removable bottom
 
  Prepare the crust: In processor bowl, combine almonds, sugar, vanilla
  and almond extracts. Proceed until very fine. Add the flour and salt;
  pulse unit well mixed. Cut butter into 10 to 12 pieces and distribute
  over flour mixture. Process until mixture resembles coarse meal.
  Sprinkle in water and pulse until mixture starts to form a dough.
  Turn out onto a sheet of plastic wrap and push together into a flat
  patty. Refrigerate 30 minutes or until firm enough to roll.
  
  Roll dough, between two pieces of plastic wrap, into a circle about 11
  inches in diameter and 1/8-inch thick. Peel off top sheet of plastic.
  Use bottom sheet to lift pastry and invert it into tart pan. Line pan
  as much as possible using the plastic still attached to pastry, as an
  aid, easing dough into corners without stretching. Peel plastic from
  dough. If dough is too soft and plastic won't peel, place in freezer
  of refrigerator for a few minutes before peeling. Pinch dough off at
  upper rim of pan. Patch the dough as needed with pinched off bits of
  dough. Reinforce sides, strengthen corners and neaten up rim of
  crust, making everything as even as possible. Chill at least one hour.
  
  Position rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 400 degrees. Prick
  bottom of pastry shell all over with a fork. Bake 15 to 20 minutes
  until golden brown Check after 6 to 8 minutes; if bottom has puffed
  up, prick again with a fork or skewer to deflate. While still hot,
  press the bottom of the pan gently just enough to release the edges
  of the crust from the pan. Leave crust in pan. Cool on a rack. Cool
  completely before filling.
  
  Make the filling: Simmer jelly with sugar 2 to 3 minutes until
  thickened. Brush bottom of cooled pastry shell with just enough hot
  jelly to coat thinly, reserving the rest.
  
  In a small saucepan, bring cream to a simmer. Place chopped chocolate
  and butter, cut into small pieces, in a medium sized bowl. Pour hot
  cream over chocolate. Let stand one minute. Stir gently without
  whisking or beating until chocolate is completely melted and smooth.
  Do not reheat; if chocolate is not completely melted, set the mixture
  aside for a few minutes then stir again. Pour mixture into tart
  shell. Refrigerate until firm. Arrange berries over chocolate,
  starting around the edge and working toward the center, leaving a
  tiny bit of space between each berry so that some chocolate is
  visible. Reheat the red currant jelly and dab each berry lightly to
  give it a little shine--do not overdo--no need to use up all of the
  jelly.
  
  Remove tart rim and place tart on serving dish. Decorate the edge or
  center of the tart with chocolate shavings. Refrigerate tart until
  30-60 minutes before serving. To serve, us a very fine sieve or tea
  strainer to dust powdered sugar over berries and shavings, like a
  very light snowfall.
  
  To make chocolate shavings: Scrape a sharp knife blade across the
  flat side of a bar of bittersweet chocolate. The shavings will be
  very fine and very fragile; do not touch them with your fingers or
  they will melt! Transfer shavings on the knife blade.

    2/3 c  (3 1/2 ounces) whole
           Blanched almonds
    3/4 c  Sugar
      3 tb (1-2) egg whites
    1/2 ts Almond extract
           Chocolate Ganache, made and
           Chilled at least 5 to 6
           Hours in advance,
           Recipe follows
           Sarah Bernhardt Chocolate
           Glaze, recipe follows
           Gold leaves or 2 tablespoons
           Minced unsalted shelled
           Pistachios
           Special Equipment:
           Pastry bag fitted with a
           Plain #9 tip (5/8-inch)
 
  To Make Macaroons: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a food
  processor fitted with a steel blade, grind almonds and sugar until
  fine. Add egg whites and almond extract and process to a paste.
  
  Transfer mixture to the pastry bag. Pipe 1 1/2-inch high, leaving
  about 1-inch between macaroons on the parchment-lined baking sheet.
  Let stand for 30 minutes. Meanwhile preheat oven to 300 degrees.
  
  Bake macaroons until they begin to color, about 20 minutes. Cool on
  baking sheet on a wire rack. When cool, carefully peel each cookie
  from the parchment paper. Macaroons may be completed up to 3 days in
  advance. Wrap well and refrigerate.
  
  To Assemble and Finish Pastries: Wash and dry pastry bag and tip, then
  re-assemble. Beat chilled Chocolate Ganache until the color lightens
  and mixture becomes stiff enough to hold its shape. Do not overbeat
  or ganache will have a granular texture. Transfer ganache to pastry
  bag. Pipe a 2-inch high kiss-shaped mound on top of each Macaroon.
  Refrigerate until well chilled, at least 1 hour.
  
  Meanwhile, prepare Sarah Bernhardt Chocolate Glaze. Strain glaze
  through a fine strainer. Allow to cool until a small dab on your
  upper lip feels barely cool, about 88 degrees. Transfer glaze to a
  narrow container tall enough to dip the pastries. Hold the cookie
  part of each pastry carefully and dip each one, upside down, into the
  glaze, reaching deep enough just to cover ganache. Set pastry upright
  and top with a pinch of pistachio, if desired. Refrigerate pastries
  immediately; keep chilled until ready to serve. If you are decorating
  with gold leaf, omit pistachios. Before applying gold leaf, chill
  pastries until glaze is set.
  
  Apply gold leaf by touching the thin gold sheets with a tiny artist's
  brush; the gold will come off in tiny pieces and stick to the brush.
  Touch the brush to the pastry to transfer the gold to the pastry.
  Pastries may be completed up to 2 days in advance of serving.
  Refrigerate in a covered container.
  
  Yield: 20-24 pastries
  
  *edible, real gold and silver leaf is available from Indian Grocery
  stores where it is called Vark. It is also available from art supply
  stores. It must be a least 23 carats to be considered edible.

      1 lg Egg
      1 tb Water
      1 pk Store bought frozen puff
           Pastry, thawed
           Coriander walnut filling,
           Recipe follows
 
  Trim tenderloin if necessary and pat dry. Halve tenderloin crosswise
  and season with salt and pepper. In a large heavy skillet heat oil
  over moderately high heat until just smoking and brown beef, 1 piece
  at a time, on all sides, about 2 minutes total for each piece of
  beef, transferring to a platter.
  
  Make an egg wash by lightly beating egg with water. On a lightly
  floured surface with a floured rolling pin roll out pastry into a 19
  by 15-inch rectangle (slightly less than 1/4-inch thick). Cut a
  1-inch strip of dough from a shorter end (leaving an 18 by 15-inch
  rectangle) and reserve strip. Arrange rectangle lengthwise on a
  baking sheet or tray (about 17 1/2 by 12 1/2-inches), letting excess
  hang over. Spread one third filling lengthwise down middle of
  rectangle, forming a 16 by 2-inch strip. Arrange beef pieces end to
  end lengthwise on filling and spread remaining filling on top of
  beef. Brush edges of dough with some egg wash. Fold up long sides of
  dough to enclose beef completely and seal edge. Fold ends of dough
  over wrapped beef and seal edges. Invert a large baking sheet onto
  wrapped beef and invert beef onto sheet so that pastry is seam side
  down. Brush crust evenly with some egg wash. Cut out holly leaves and
  berries from reserved pastry strip and arrange on crust, gently
  pressing to make them adhere. Brush decorations with some egg wash
  and with a sharp knife make small steam vents every 3 inches on top
  of crest. Chill beef en croute, loosely covered, at least 1 hour and
  up to 6.
  
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bake beef en croute in middle of oven 45
  minutes, or until pastry is golden brown and a thermometer inserted
  diagonally 2 inches into center of beef registers 115 degrees. Let
  beef stand on sheet on a rack 25 minutes. Beef will continue to cook
  as it stands, reaching 125 degrees (medium rare).

      Title: Roast Goose With Port Gravy
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     12 lb Goose (with neck and
           Giblets; reserve liver for
           Another use) *
      3    Onions
      2    Celery ribs
           About 3 bread slices (any
           Type)
      2    Carrots
      1 c  Boiling water
      1 c  Dry white wine
    1/4 c  Tawny Port
    1/3 c  All purpose flour
      3 c  Chicken broth
           Garnish:
           Fresh flat leafed parsley
           Sprigs
 
  *Available by special order from some butchers and by mail order from
  D'Artagnan, 800-327-8246
  
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Discard loose fat from goose. With a
  cleaver or heavy knife cut goose neck into 2-inch pieces. Quarter 1
  onion and quarter celery crosswise. Rinse goose inside and out and
  pat dry. Pierce skin of goose all over with a fork to allow fat to
  drain and help skin to become crisp. Season goose with salt and
  pepper and loosely pack neck cavity with enough bread to fill out
  cavity (this will prevent cavity skin from collapsing during
  roasting). Fold neck skin under body and fasten with a small skewer.
  Fill body cavity with quartered onion and celery and tie legs
  together loosely with kitchen string (or insert legs through slit in
  lower skin flap if provided).
  
  Cut remaining 2 onions and carrots into 2-inch pieces. Transfer goose,
  breast side up, to a rack set in a deep flameproof roasting pan (at
  least 2 inches, not non stick) and scatter onion and carrot pieces,
  neck pieces, and giblets in pan. Roast goose in middle of oven 30
  minutes. Reduce temperature to 325 degrees and carefully pour boiling
  water over goose (juices may splatter). Roast goose, skimming off fat
  (save fat for another use) and basting with pan juices using a metal
  bulb baster every 20 minutes, 2 to 2 1/2 hours more, or until a meat
  thermometer inserted in fleshy part of thigh registers 175 degrees
  and juices run clear. Transfer goose to a heated platter. Remove
  skewer and discard string. Keep goose warm, loosely covered with foil.
  
  With a slotted spoon discard vegetables, neck pieces, and giblets
  from pan. Spoon off fat from pan juices and reserve. On top of stove
  deglaze pan with white wine and Port over moderately high heat,
  scraping up brown bits, and boil mixture until reduced by about half.
  In a 2 1/2 to 3-quart heavy saucepan whisk together 1/4 cup reserved
  fat (save remainder for another use) and flour and cook roux over
  moderately low heat, whisking, 3 minutes. Add Port mixture and broth
  in a stream, whisking to prevent lumps, and bring gravy to a boil,
  whisking constantly. Simmer gravy, whisking frequently, 5 minutes, or
  until thickened. Season gravy with salt and pepper. Transfer gravy to
  a heated sauceboat. Garnish goose with parsley.

  pan to coat them with butter, and brown on all sides until nicely
  caramelized to a rich, golden brown color.  This will take about 6 to
  8 minutes. Sprinkle with the sugar, add the salt, pepper, and stock,

  garnishing. Save remaining pineapple for another use. Make a small
  slice on the outside of each half to create a flat base to hold the
  pineapple steady. Set aside.
  
  Crumble the cold rice between your fingers to separate the grains,
  and set aside.
  
  Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a wok or large skillet, swirling to
  coat the pan. Add the onion and toss until soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add
  the garlic and toss until fragrant and soft, about 1 to 2 minutes.
  Add the ginger and toss for another minute.
  
  Add the remaining tablespoon of oil, then add the rice. Fry for 2 to 3
  minutes over high heat, then add the beans, tomatoes, and pineapple,
  and fry 2 to 3 minutes more. Add the fish sauce and sugar, and toss
  until ingredients are well combined and rice is heated thoroughly,
  about 5 minutes. Add the green onions and toss to combine. Remove
  from the heat and transfer to a serving platter, or if using fresh
  pineapple, fill each half of prepared pineapple with warm rice and
  garnish with extra chunks of pineapple.

      2 tb Masa flour
  1 1/2 lb Shoestring potatoes
    1/2 lb Grated Cheddar cheese
    1/2 lb Grated Monterey Jack cheese
      1 c  Sour cream
    1/2 c  Pickled jalapenos
 
  Preheat the fryer. In a large saucepan, heat the vegetable oil. When
  the oil is hot, add the onions and saute for 3 to 5 minutes, or until
  the vegetables start to wilt. Season with salt and cayenne. Stir in
  the venison , chili powder, cumin, crushed red pepper, and oregano.
  Brown the meat for 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in the garlic, tomatoes,
  tomato paste, and 2 1/2 cups beef stock. Bring the liquid up to a
  boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer the liquid, uncovered for 1 hour,
  stirring occasionally, or until the venison is tender. Skim off the
  fat occasionally. Mix the masa and remaining stock together. Slowly
  stir in the masa slurry and continue to cook for 30 minutes. Reseason
  with salt and cayenne. Fry the shoestring potatoes in batches until
  golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the shoestrings from the
  oil and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season the fries with salt and
  pepper. Cover the bottom of a large, glass rectangular pan with the
  shoestrings. Sprinkle 3 cups of the two cheeses over the fries. Place
  the fries in the oven and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, just until the
  cheese melts. Remove the pan from the oven and spoon the chili over
  the top of the fries. Garnish with the remaining cheese, sour cream
  and jalapenos.

      Title: Souffle Au Chocolat Et Au Grand Marnier
 Categories: Toohot
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           About 1 to 2 tablespoon
           Unsalted butter, softened
           About 1/4 cup white sugar
           For the souffle(s):
      4 tb Unsalted butter, cut into
           Bits
      7 oz Bittersweet or semisweet
           Chocolate, chopped finely
      2 tb Grand Marnier
      4    Egg yolks
      8    Egg whites
    1/2 ts Cream of tartar
    1/4 c  White sugar
 
  Coat a large straight sided porcelain baking dish or souffle mold
  (about 8-inches diameter and 4- deep) with the softened butter.
  Alternatively, you can use eight individual straightsided porcelain
  ramekins. Coat evenly and generously all the way to the top, making
  sure to get the corners. Sprinkle in some sugar and toss around to
  coat the bottom and sides of the mold or molds. Place molds in the
  refrigerator to chill (if using individual molds, place them on a
  cookie sheet first.)
  
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Find a medium metal bowl that completely
  covers the top of a small saucepan. Place 3 inches of water in the
  saucepan and bring to the simmer. Turn off the heat. Place cut up
  butter and chocolate in the bowl and place bowl over pan of hot
  water. Let sit for 2 minutes then stir. It should be completely
  melted; if not, remove the bowl, bring the water back to a simmer,
  turn off the heat and replace the bowl. Stir until smooth. Stir in
  the Grand Marnier. Set aside to let cool to room temperature. Place
  egg yolks in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whip. Beat
  egg yolks at medium speed until opaque and lightened in color, about
  3 minutes. Add to cooled chocolate mixture.
  
  Bring medium pot of water to a boil. Clean mixer bowl and whip well,
  and dry them. Place egg whites in bowl and whip at high speed 2
  minutes, then reduce speed to medium and add the cream of tartar.
  Whip until soft peaks form then slowly add the granulated sugar down
  the side of the bowl while continuing to whip until firm peaks form.
  Take 1/3 of the whites and whisk into chocolate mixture to lighten
  it. Fold in remaining whites with a large rubber spatula, trying not
  to deflate the whites. Fold gently but thoroughly until no white
  streaks remain. Remove coated molds from the refrigerator. Fill mold
  or molds with souffle mixture, up to 1/2-inch from rim. Run your
  thumb around the inside of each mold to form a shallow groove all
  around. When all molds have been filled transfer to the oven and bake
  until risen and top is evenly dried, about 10 minutes for individual
  soufflJs and about 25 minutes for a large. Serve immediately.
  
  Classic souffle technique: egg yolks combined with flavoring base,
  lightened with whipped egg whites and baked until risen. Very
  important that all equipment used for beating whites be scrupulously
  clean. Running thumb around mold encourages an even rise.

      2 c  Water
      1 c  Sugar
 
  Find a medium metal bowl that completely covers the top of a small
  saucepan. Place 3 inches of water in the saucepan and bring to the
  simmer. Turn off the heat. Place cutup chocolate in the bowl and
  place bowl over pan of hot water. Let sit for 2 minutes then stir.
  Chocolate should be completely melted; if not, return to pot of water
  to the simmer, turn it off, and replace the bowl, stirring until it
  is completely melted. Do not let chocolate become too hot. Remove
  bowl from saucepan and let chocolate cool to room temperature. In
  another medium saucepan, combine the 2 cups water and the sugar and
  cook over medium heat until all sugar has dissolved. Remove from the
  heat and let cool to room temperature.
  
  When both the chocolate and the syrup are at room temperature,
  combine them
  
  in a large metal bowl. Refrigerate the mixture until completely
  chilled; it should feel cold to the touch. Put into an icecream maker
  and freeze. Scoop out and place in a small container. Chill until
  completely firm. Scoop and serve.

 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  (2 sticks) unsalted butter,
           At room temperature
      1 c  Light or dark brown sugar,
           Packed
      1 lg Egg
      1 c  Ground toasted filberts or
           Almonds
  2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
      1 ts Freshly ground cardamom
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts Ground cloves
    1/2 ts Ground allspice
    1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
 
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In the large bowl, cream the
  butter with the sugar using an electric mixer. Add the egg and ground
  nuts. In another bowl, mix the flour with the baking powder, soda,
  cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, allspice and nutmeg. Blend the dry
  ingredients into the creamed mixture until a stiff dough forms. Shape
  the dough into a ball. (At this point, you can wrap the dough in
  plastic wrap and refrigerate it to develop the flavor, for up to a
  week). Cut off a portion of the dough at a time and roll between your
  hands and a lightly floured work surface to make slim, ropes about
  1/2-inch thick. Place 4 or 5 ropes on an ungreased cookie sheet. Cut
  ropes into 1/2-inch pieces using a sharp, small knife. Separate the
  pieces. Bake for 8 minutes or until the cookies are lightly browned
  and dry. Remove from the oven; cool on the baking sheet.
  
  Yield: about 600 tiny peppernuts
  
  I like to make these spicy peppernuts in quantity so that I can serve
  them in baskets - like you would salted nuts or candy. They add a
  wonderful, spicy aroma to the air. This is based on a recipe I
  received many years ago from a Danish friend. Although the mere idea
  of baking hundreds of nut-sized cookies sounds like an enormous
  amount of work, I've simplified
  
  the procedure. I just roll the dough into 1/2 inch thick strips and
  cut them into 1/2 inch pieces with scissors, dropping the dough bits
  right on an ungreased cookie sheet. I can bake a hundred or more on
  one baking sheet! The flavor of the peppernuts mellow and improves
  after being stored in an airtight tin in a cool place for 3 to 4 days.

  flour and baking powder and add all at once to eggs. Stir just to
  blend. Add flavoring or garnish. Spoon mixture lengthwise onto cookie
  sheet lined with parchment paper or greased. Spoon into a "log",
  shape as wide as you choose, the width of the "log" will determine
  the length of the cut biscotti. Make as many "logs" as you have mix.
  Allow logs to sit for about 10 minutes at room temperature before
  baking. Bake at 350 for approximately 20 minutes or until center of
  log springs back when touched. Remove from oven and let cool
  thoroughly. Cut logs into strips crosswise. Standard is about 1/2
  inch. Place each biscotti cut side down onto cookie sheet lined with
  parchment or lightly greased. Bake again for approximately 15 minutes
  or until lightly browned on edges. Cool thoroughly, then store in
  airtight container.

  into rings and place on the baking sheet.
  
  Bake for 10 minutes, just until lightly browned. Slide baked cookies
  on the parchment off the baking sheet onto the countertop to cool, or
  place onto a wire rack to cool.
  
  While the cookies bake, combine the chocolate chips and cream in a
  small glass bowl. Microwave at high power 1 minute at a time, or
  place over simmering water, stirring until melted. Dip cooled cookies
  in the chocolate so that ends are coated by 1/2 inch. Place on the
  parchment or on waxed paper to harden.

      Title: Roast Goose
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Honey
      1 c  White vinegar
           Enough water to cover the
           Goose (4 to 6 quarts)
           One 10 to 12 pound fresh
           Goose
      2 tb Salt
      2 tb Freshly ground black pepper
      2    Bay leaves
      2 tb Dried thyme
      2 tb Dried rosemary
      4    Cloves garlic
      1 sm Onion
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/2 c  Flour
      3 c  Chicken stock
 
  Place the honey, vinegar, and water in a pot large enough to hold the
  goose, submerged. Bring the liquid to the boil and add the raw goose
  to the pot. Return to the boil, reduce the heat and cook the goose at
  a strong simmer for 20 minutes to render some of the grease as well
  as begin to tenderize the normally chewy bird. Remove the goose from
  the liquid and allow to cool at room temperature for 20 to 30
  minutes, or until cool enough to handle.
  
  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
  
  Prick the goose skin all around the carcass. Season the cavity with
  half of the salt and pepper, add the herbs, onion and garlic. Truss
  the legs and season the outside of the goose with the remaining salt
  and pepper and the olive oil.
  
  Preheat a heavy roasting pan for 10 minutes.
  
  Place the goose, breast side down, on a rack in the roasting pan and
  roast in the oven, skimming the fat and reserving it for another use,
  for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Turn the goose breast side up and roast,
  basting it with pan juices and skimming the fat, for 1 hour and 30
  minutes to 2 hours more, or until the juices run clear when the
  fleshy part of the thigh is pricked with a fork and a meat
  thermometer inserted in the fleshy part of the thigh registers 165
  degrees.
  
  Transfer the goose to a platter, remove the trussing string, and keep
  the goose warm, covered loosely with foil. Skim off all but 1/4 cup
  of fat from the pan juices, add the flour, and cook the roux over
  moderately low heat, stirring, until it has browned slightly. Add the
  stock in a stream, whisking, and simmer the mixture, stirring
  occasionally, for 20 minutes. Season with salt and
  
  pepper and strain the gravy into a heated sauceboat.

      Title: Buche De Noel Glace
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 qt Good quality coffee frozen
           Yogurt or low fat ice cream
      6 lg Eggs, separated
      1 ts Vanilla extract
    3/4 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Cream of tartar
    1/4 c  Dutch Process cocoa
           Additional cocoa for
           Dusting
           For the meringue topping:
    1/4 ts Cream of tartar
      3 ts Water
    1/2 c  Sugar
      3    Egg whites
      2 tb Powdered sugar
           Bittersweet Chocolate Sauce,
           Optional
           Equipment:
           Two 17 1/2 x 11 1/2 inch
           Jelly roll pans
           Instant read thermometer
     14 x  4 inch piece of corregated
           Cardboard wrapped in foil
 
  Form the sheet of frozen yogurt:  Line the bottom and sides of one of
  the pans with aluminum foil.  If the frozen yogurt is rock hard,
  refrigerate it briefly until softened slightly; it must be scoopable
  but still very firm. (Note that frozen yogurt melts much more quickly
  than ice cream, so it must be very firm when we begin to work with
  it.) Distribute scoops of yogurt all over the pan. Working quickly
  and leaving about 4 inches at one end of the pan uncovered, spread
  the yogurt evenly in the pan by mashing the scoops with he back of a
  large spoon and pushing them together. Cover with foil and freeze at
  least several hours or until needed. Make the cocoa souffle sheet:
  Position the rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350
  degrees F. Line the bottom of the second pan with a piece of
  parchment or wax paper. In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks with
  vanilla and 1/2 cup of the sugar until pale and thick. Set aside. In
  a separate mixing bowl, with clean dry beater, beat the egg whites
  and cream of tartar on medium speed until soft peaks form. Gradually
  sprinkle in the remaining sugar, continue to beat at high speed until
  stiff but not dry. Fold a quarter of the egg whites into the yolk
  mixture to lighten it. Scrape the remaining whites into the bowl and
  sift the cocoa over them. Fold until completely incorporated. Spread
  the batter evenly in the pan and bake until the pastry springs back
  when gently pressed with fingertips, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool
  completely, in the pan on a wire rack. Sprinkle a large sheet of foil
  with cocoa.  Run a small knife or metal spatula around the edges of
  the cocoa pastry to detach it from the pan. Invert the cocoa pastry
  onto the foil sheet.  Remove the pan and peel the paper pan liner
  from the cocoa pastry. Assemble the roll: Remove the sheet of frozen
  yogurt from the freezer and remove the foil covering.  Center and
  invert the yogurt sheet on top of the cocoa souffle sheet.  Remove
  the pan and the foil. The long edges should be lined up and but there
  should be 2 inches of cocoa souffle exposed at each end. Fold the
  exposed pastry over the yogurt at one end of the sheet. Continue to
  roll the pastry and yogurt up together, using the foil underneath as
  an aid as necessary. Do not worry if there is some initial cracking
  as you roll, however, if the yogurt is much too stiff to roll, wait a
  few minutes until it is pliable.  Wrap the roll in foil and return to
  the freezer overnight or until hard. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees
  F. Make the meringue topping: Bring 1-inch of water to a simmer in a
  large skillet. Combine the water, cream of tartar and sugar in a 6 to
  8 cup stainless bowl.  Whisk in the egg whites.  Place thermometer
  near stove in a mug of very hot tap water.  Set bowl in skillet. Stir
  mixture briskly and constantly with a rubber spatula, scraping the
  sides and bottom often to avoid scrambling the egg white. After 1 1/2
  minutes, remove the bowl from the skillet. Quickly insert
  thermometer, tilting bowl to cover stem by at least 2 inches. If less
  than 160 degrees F, rinse thermometer in simmering skillet water and
  return it to mug. Replace the bowl in skillet. Stir as before until
  temperature reaches 160 degrees F when bowl is removed.  Beat on high
  speed until cool and stiff.  Set aside. Remove the frozen roll from
  the freezer and unwrap it.  Place the roll on the foil wrapped
  cardboard.  Use a metal spatula to cover the roll completely with a
  thick coating of meringue topping.  Leave no cake exposed and be sure
  that the meringue touches the foiled cardboard all along the base of
  the roll. Use a fork to texture the meringue to resemble tree bark.
  Transfer the buche on its foiled base to a baking sheet. Sieve
  powdered sugar over the buche.  Bake just until golden, 4 to 6
  minutes, watching carefully. Slide a wide spatula or pancake turner
  under the foiled cardboard and transfer the buche to a serving
  platter.  Serve immediately with Bittersweet Chocolate Sauce, if
  desired.

           To 6 ounces
      2    To 3 tablespoons red current
           Jelly or raspberry
           Preserves
 
  9 x 9 inch cake pan, Baking pan or roasting at least 2 inches deep and
  large enough to hold the cake pan with at least 2 inches to spare on
  each side.
  
  Position the rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350
  degrees. Line the bottom and sides of the pan with foil. Put a kettle
  of water on to boil for the bain marie when baking in the oven.
  
  Place chocolate in a large mixing bowl. Combine the 2 egg yolks with
  vanilla in a small bowl. Place the 3 egg whites in a medium bowl with
  cream of tartar. Set all 3 bowls aside.
  
  Combine the cocoa, flour and 2/3 cup sugar in a 1 1 1/2 quart heavy
  bottomed saucepan. Whisk in enough of the milk to form a smooth
  paste. Mix in the remaining milk. Cook over medium heat, stirring
  constantly with a wooden spoon, to prevent burning (especially around
  the bottom edges of the pot), until mixture begins to simmer. Simmer
  very gently, stirring constantly, for about 1 1/2 minutes, or until
  the mixture visibly thickens. Pour the hot mixture immediately over
  the chopped chocolate. Stir until chocolate is completely melted and
  smooth. Whisk in egg yolk mixture. Set aside.
  
  Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar at medium speed until soft
  peaks form. Gradually sprinkle in the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar,
  beating at high speed until stiff but not dry. Fold a quarter of the
  egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it. Fold in
  remaining egg whites. Scrape mixture into the cake pan and spread
  evenly. Set cake pan in baking pan and place on oven rack. Pour
  enough boiling water into the baking pan to come a third to halfway
  up the sides of the cake pan.
  
  Bake for exactly 20 minutes. The cake will only be about 3/4 inches
  tall. The surface will spring back when gently pressed but cake will
  still be quite gooey inside. Remove cake pan and water pan from oven.
  Remove the cake pan from the water and cool completely on a rack.
  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight before serving.
  Refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze up to 2 months.
  
  After the truffle sheet is well chilled, lift the edges of the foil to
  remove the truffle sheet from the pan. Cut the sheet into 7 strips,
  each about 1 1/4 inches wide, using a long thin sharp knife dipping
  in hot water and wiped dry between each cut (the cake is very sticky)
  or cut with dental floss. Cut each strip into 7 squares. Transfer
  each square to a fluted paper candy cup and or arrange on a serving
  platter. If garnishing with raspberries, simmer the preserves for a
  minute or until thick and sticky. Touch the hot preserves with the

           Curd cottage cheese, drained
           At least 30
           Minutes in a strainer set
           Over a bowl in the
           Refrigerator
      8 oz Neufchatel Cream Cheese
           (Kraft in the box is good
           Don't buy the
           Kind in the tub)
      3 lg Eggs
      1 tb Vanilla extract
  1 1/2 ts Strained lemon juice
    1/4 ts Salt
     34 tb Graham cracker or Zwieback
           Crumbs or crushed Chocolate
           Cookies or gingersnaps
 
  8-inch round pan with a solid bottom (no spring form), at least 2
  inches deep.
  
  Oven proof baking dish or skillet, at least 11 inches in diameter and
  2 inches deep.
  
  8-inch cardboard cake circle or pan bottom, optional
  
  Make the lemon curd: Combine the lemon zest, juice, and sugar in a
  small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Meanwhile beat the egg until
  light in a small bowl. Beat some of the hot lemon mixture into the
  egg. Scrape the egg mixture back into the saucepan. Cook, stirring
  constantly and reaching all over the bottom and sides of the pan,
  until the mixture barely starts to simmer around the edges. Continue
  to cook and stir for about 15 seconds. Pour through a strainer set
  over a clean bowl. Stir in the vanilla. Cool to room temperature.
  
  Make the cheesecake batter: Position rack in lower third of oven and
  preheat to 350 degrees. Place a round of parchment paper in the
  bottom of the cake pan. and spray sides of pan with vegetable oil
  spray. Put water
  
  kettle on to boil for baking procedure.
  
  Process the cottage cheese in a food processor for 2 1/2 3 minutes or
  until silky smooth, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl once or
  twice as necessary. Set aside.
  
  In a small microwave safe bowl, soften the Neufchatel cheese in
  microwave on high for about 30 seconds. Or, warm gently in the top of
  a double boiler. Stir until smooth. Scrape into the processor. Add
  the eggs, remaining sugar, vanilla, lemon juice, and salt. Pulse
  until incorporated and perfectly smooth. Do not over process.
  
  Scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Distribute slightly rounded
  tablespoons of lemon curd evenly over the cheesecake batter. Using a
  table knife or teaspoon, use circular strokes to marble the batters
  until nicely but not to completely mingled.
  
  Slide oven rack part way out. Place cheesecake pan in baking dish or
  skillet and set on oven rack. Carefully pour boiling water around the
  pan to a depth of about 1-inch. Slide oven rack in gently to avoid
  sloshing. Bake until cheesecake has puffed and risen slightly and is
  just beginning to shrink from the edges of the pan, about 4045
  minutes. Remove cheesecake from water bath and cool on a rack. When
  completely cool, cover and chill for at least 12 hours or up to 2
  days before serving.
  
  To unmold and serve: Cover the pan with tightly stretched plastic
  wrap. Place a flat dish on top of plastic. Invert pan and dish and
  rap the pan gently until cheesecake is released from pan. Remove pan
  and peel parchment liner from bottom of cake. Place cake circle or
  serving plate on the cake and carefully invert so that cake is right
  side up. Remove plastic wrap. Press crumbs around sides of cake. Cut
  with a sharp thin knife. Dip the knife in hot water and wipe it dry
  between cuts. Yield: 10 to 12 servings

  TIPS
  
  The suave texture of this cheesecake relies on ultra smooth cottage
  cheese. This requires a food processor and at least 2 1/23 minutes or
  processing, no cheating.
  
  Once the Neufchatel Cheese has been added, pulse only enough to
  incorporate. over processing thins the batter.
  
  If you use nonfat cottage instead of low fat, the results will be not
  be nearly as good and you would save only about .4 grams of fat per
  serving. It's not worth it.

      Title: Profiteroles With Bourbon Ice Cream
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  Whole milk
      6    Extra-large egg yolks
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Heavy cream
      3 tb Bourbon
      1 tb Dark rum
    1/2 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
           For the cream puff batter
           (pate a choux):
      5    Extra-large whole eggs
      1 c  Water
      1    Stick (1/4 pound) unsalted
           Butter
    1/8 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Granulated sugar
      1 c  Sifted unbleached flour
      1    Recipe Fudge Sauce (recipe
           Follows)
           For the egg wash:
      1    Egg combined with 1
           TB water
           Special Equipment:
           Ice Cream Maker
           Pastry bag with a straight
        md Tip (optional)
           Bakers' parchment
 
  To make the ice cream, pour the milk into a heavy-bottomed pot. Bring
  the milk gently to a boil over medium heat, being careful not to
  scorch it or allow it to boil over. Lower the heat and simmer 10
  minutes, uncovered. Remove from heat.
  
  Meanwhile, in the large bowl of an electric mixer, bet the egg yolks
  and sugar together at medium speed 5 minutes. Then add several
  tablespoons of the hot milk to the egg/sugar mixture to temper the
  eggs. Return the pot of milk to the stove and, over low heat, add the
  egg yolk/sugar mixture in a slow, steady stream, stirring with a
  wooden spoon. Continue to cook 7 or 8 minutes, stirring constantly,
  until the custard has thickened and coats the back of a spoon. Remove
  from heat and cool completely in an ice water bath. Stir in the
  bourbon, rum, and nutmeg.
  
  When the custard has cooled completely, add the heavy cream and freeze
  according to the directions for your ice cream maker. While the ice
  cream is freezing, begin the pate a choux, the classic French pastry
  from which cream puff shells (profiteroles) are made.
  
  Being careful not to break the yolks, break the eggs into a measuring
  cup or another container from which they can be poured one at a time,
  and set the container beside the stove. In a heavy-bottomed pot,
  bring the water, butter, salt, and sugar to a boil. When the liquid
  boils, stir in the flour all at once, using a wooden spoon. Reduce
  the heat to low and stir continuously 3 to 4 minutes, until the
  mixture pulls together and away from the sides of the pot. Chefs call
  this "cooking the flour out". What you are doing is coking away the
  raw flour flavor.
  
  Still over low heat, add the eggs, one at a time, incorporating each
  egg individually until it is completely absorbed by the flour before
  adding the next one. During this process, the mixture will take on a
  shiny gloss and become very elastic. When all of the eggs have been
  incorporated, remove from heat, place the mixture in a
  stainless-steel bowl and cool completely.
  
  To make the profiteroles, preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Using a
  pastry bag with a straight medium tip, pipe out approximately 1
  rounded tablespoon batter for each profiterole onto a cookie sheet
  lined with lightly buttered bakers parchment, spacing them
  approximately 1 inch apart. If a bag and tip are unavailable, use a
  tablespoon to mound the batter on the bakers paper.
  
  Brush each profiterole lightly with the egg wash, place in the
  preheated oven and bake 15 minutes before reducing the temperature to
  350 degrees. Bake until the puffs are golden brown, about 12 minutes
  more. Remove from oven and allow to cool. When they have cooled
  completely, cut open and fill with a small scoop of ice cream. As you
  fill each profiterole, place it in the freezer to keep the ice cream
  frozen until you are ready to serve. To serve, place 1 profiterole on
  each plate, top with Fudge Sauce, and serve immediately.

      Title: Smothered Pork Chops
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8    3/4 -inch-thick shoulder
           Pork chops (about 4 pounds)
      1 ts Plus 1 tablespoon salt
      1 ts Plus 1 tablespoon freshly
           Ground black pepper
      2 c  Plus 2 tablespoons
           All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      2 lg Onions, coarsely chopped
      2    Green bell peppers, cored,
           Seeded, and coarsely
           Chopped
      2    Stalks celery, coarsely
           Chopped
      2 c  Water
 
  You'll need two heavy skillets with lids or a large Dutch oven to
  finish cooking these chops, but it's easier to brown them and make
  the gravy in one skillet.
  
  Trim the excess fat from the edges of the pork chops. Sprinkle them
  with 1 teaspoon each of the salt and pepper. Season 2 cups of the
  flour with the remaining 1 tablespoon each of salt and pepper. Dredge
  the pork chops in the flour until coated on all sides. Shake off any
  excess flour.
  
  Pour the vegetable oil into a heavy deep skillet (cast-iron is
  perfect) over medium-high heat. When the oil begins to shake
  slightly, add as many pork chops as will fit in the pan without
  touching. Fry, turning once, until well browned on both sides, about
  5 minutes. Remove the chops to a plate and repeat with the remaining
  chops.
  
  Pour off all but 4 tablespoons of drippings from the skillet. Reduce
  the heat to medium and add the onions, green peppers, and celery to
  the skillet. Cook until brown and tender, about 10 minutes. Move the
  vegetables to one side of the skillet and sprinkle the 2 tablespoons
  of flour over the bottom of the skillet. Cook the flour until golden
  brown, stirring constantly and being careful not to let the flour
  burn. Slowly pour in the water and stir until you have a smooth gravy.
  
  Divide the pork chops between two heavy skillets with lids or place
  them all in a large heavy Dutch oven. Top with the gravy and
  vegetables and cover the skillets or Dutch oven tightly. Simmer over
  low heat until the vegetables are tender and the pork chops are
  cooked through, about 15 minutes. Check the seasoning and add salt
  and pepper as necessary. Serve the pork chops, spooning some of the
  gravy and vegetables over each. Pass extra gravy.

      Title: Toasted Espresso Biscotti
 Categories: Taste
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/4 c  Almonds (6 ounces)
      6 tb Espresso coffee beans
      1 c  Sugar
  2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      2 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Salt
      1    Stick chilled unsalted
           Butter, cut in small pieces
      3    Eggs, lightly beaten
    1/4 c  Brewed espresso
           Ground cinnamon or cocoa,
           For dusting
      4 oz Bittersweet chocolate,
           Melted for dipping
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease cookie sheet.
  
  Spread almonds and espresso beans on 2 separate baking sheets; bake 8
  to 10 minutes or until lightly toasted. In a food processor fitted
  with steel blade, coarsely chop half of espresso beans; transfer to a
  small bowl. In food processor finely chop almonds and remaining
  espresso beans with 1/2 cup of the sugar and add to bowl.
  
  In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. Use your
  fingers to quickly cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse
  crumbs. Stir in remaining sugar and coffee-almond mixture. Add eggs
  and brewed espresso, stirring until dough comes together.
  
  On lightly-floured surface, knead dough 2 minutes until smooth. Shape
  into 2 flat 2-inch-wide logs; dust with cinnamon or cocoa and place
  on cookie sheet. Bake 25 minutes, or until lightly browned. Remove
  from oven and cool on baking sheet. When cool enough to handle, use a
  serrated knife to slice logs on the diagonal into 1/2-inch-wide
  pieces. Place cut side down on cookie sheet and return to oven 8 to
  10 minutes or until lightly golden. Cool on racks. Dip in melted
  chocolate, if desired, and let dry on wax paper. When chocolate is
  completely dried and hardened, store in tins up to 1 month.

      Title: Coconut Custard Pie
 Categories: Taste
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      9    Inch pie crust, prepared or
           Home made
           For the filling:
  2 1/2 c  Heavy cream
      3 c  Grated fresh coconut
      4 lg Eggs
    1/3 c  Sugar
      2 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Grated toasted coconut
           Lightly whipped cream and
           Additional toasted coconut
           For garnish
 
  Trim the edge of the shell, leaving a 1/2 inch overhang. Crimp the
  edge over the shell decoratively. Prick the dough with a fork and
  chill for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line with wax
  paper, weight and bake the shell in the lower third of the oven for
  15 minutes. Remove the wax paper and rice. Reduce the oven
  temperature to 375 degrees and bake the shell for 10 minutes more or
  until golden. Transfer the shell to a rack and let cool.
  
  Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and butter the second pie
  plate. In a saucepan bring the heavy cream to a simmer, stir in 2
  cups of the fresh coconut, remove from the heat and let the mixture
  stand for 20 minutes, or until it is room temperature. Transfer the
  coconut milk to the food processor and blend it for 1 minute. Strain
  the mixture through a sieve lined with cheesecloth to extract all of
  the liquid, and add the eggs, sugar, vanilla and salt. Stir in the
  remaining 1 cup coconut and pour the custard into the pie plate. Put
  the pie plate in a larger pan, add enough hot water to the pan to
  come halfway up the sides of the plate and bake in the middle of the
  oven for twenty minutes or until the edges of the custard are set.
  The center of the custard will still be a bit loose. Add additional
  toasted coconut to the top of the custard and bake for another
       10    minutes.

      Title: Pizza With Rosemary And Garlic (Pizza Bianca)
 Categories: Baker
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Dough:
  1 1/2 c  Warm water
    1/2 ts Dry yeast
      4 c  Flour (approximately):
           Unbleached all-purpose or
           Hard white flour,
           Or a 50-50 blend of white
           And whole wheat
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Olive oil
           Topping:
      2 tb Olive oil (approximately)
      1 ts Fine sea salt
           Leaves from 3 sprigs
           Rosemary (approximately 2
           Tablespoons), optional
 
  You will need a large bread bowl, a baking sheet 12 by 18-inches or
  two smaller sheets.
  
  Place water in a large bowl.  Water should be warm but not hot to the
  touch.  Stir in the yeast and allow to dissolve.  Stir in 1 cup flour,
  stirring constantly in the same direction.  Stir in another cup
  flour, then stir 100 times in the same direction (one minute). This
  helps develop the gluten.  You now have a sponge.  Cover, and let
  stand for half an hour or up to three hours.  When you are ready to
  continue, sprinkle on salt and oil, then add more flour, stirring it
  in a half cup at a time. The dough will be getting heavier and harder
  to stir. When you can stir no longer, flour a kneading surface well
  and have more flour handy beside your work surface. Turn dough out
  and knead, adding extra flour to your work surface as necessary to
  prevent the dough from sticking. The dough will gradually become
  smooth and easy to work.  Knead for 10 minutes, clean bread bowl, oil
  it lightly, and place the ball of dough into the bowl to rise,
  covered with plastic wrap.  Let rise until more than doubled, almost
  three hours. When the volume of the dough has approximately doubled,
  you can proceed to the next step.
  
  Dough can be made ahead to this point and then stored.  If you wish
  postpone baking, gently push dough down, and leave covered in the
  bowl to rise again.  If delay will be more than several hours,
  instead store dough in a plastic bag in the refrigerator (for not
  more than five days). Bring out of the cold and take out of the
  plastic bag at least an hour before you want to work with it. Lightly
  flour your work surface and lightly oil a 12 by 18-inch baking sheet.
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Turn dough out onto work surface and
  flatten with the lightly floured palm of your hand. Pull and stretch
  the dough gently out into the rectangular shape you need to fit your
  baking sheet.  Take your time and give the dough time to rest if it
  is resisting stretching.  It will need to get quite thin. When you
  have stretched the dough to approximately the shape and size you
  need, transfer it to baking sheet and continue to gently press and
  stretch it to fit. Don't worry if it tears, just patch the hole with
  another piece of dough and press firmly to join the edges. If you
  have extra dough hanging over the edge, trim it off and use it to
  make another small pizza. Dough should be of an even thinness across
  the flat part of the baking sheet and should form a slight rounded
  rim as it meets the edge (which is for many people the best part of
  the pizza).  Brush top of pizza with oil, then dimple the surface all
  over with your fingers.  Sprinkle on sea salt and then optional
  rosemary leaves.  Place baking sheet on the bottom rack of the
  preheated oven and bake until the crust around the edge is slightly
  golden, 5 to 8 minutes, depending on how thin the pizza is. Remove
  from oven, brush crusts lightly with olive oil and also the center if
  you wish. Cut into large squares and serve warm or hot. We have often
  made pizza bionic several hours ahead, then wrapped it in a clean
  kitchen towel to keep it moist until we are ready to reheat it for
  serving. To reheat, place in a dampened paper bag in a 300'F oven for
  about 10 minutes.
  
  Yield: one large 12 by 18-inch pizza or two medium, or 3 or 4 small

           Fennel seeds or coarse salt,
           Or coarse-cracked
           Black pepper, for garnish
 
  In bowl of an electric mixer stir sugar into 2 1/4 cups warm water
  (110 degrees) until dissolved. Sprinkle yeast over and set aside
  until frothy, about 10 minutes. In a large bowl mix together flour
  and salt; rub in butter with your fingers. Place bowl with yeast
  mixture on electric mixer fitted with dough hook. Start machine on
  slow speed and gradually add flour mixture to yeast mixture. Your
  dough should be firm; add more flour if needed. Mix until dough comes
  together.
  
  Flour work surface and turn out dough. Knead until smooth and
  elastic. Oil a bowl and add dough, turning to coat top. Cover and set
  aside to double in size. Turn out onto a lightly-floured surface.
  Punch dough down and cut into small workable pieces of dough. Shape
  into desired shape, such as knots, crescents, breadsticks, round
  rolls, or Parker House rolls; place on a baking sheet, leaving enough
  room between them for rolls to double. Cover with a towel and place
  in a warm draft-free place to double.
  
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees. For shiny rolls, brush with egg wash, if
  desired. Sprinkle tops with choice of suggested garnishes. Bake until
  golden brown and sound hollow when tapped. For thicker, harder crusts,
  place a small bowl of water in your oven during cooking to provide
  steam; you can also spray your oven with a water mister several times
  during baking.
  
  Yield: 12 to 15 rolls, depending on size

      1 c  Milk
      1 c  All-purpose flour
      2 tb Orange liqueur (Grand
           Marnier or Cointreau)
           Cooking spray or other food
           Release
 
  Melt the butter and set aside. Using a blender, mix the eggs, milk and
  flour at low speed. Add the orange liquor. Once the batter is well
  mixed and coats the spoon with a thin film, refrigerate, covered for
  1 hour in a pitcher or bowl.
  
  Stir the batter thoroughly and before making the crepes, test the
  liquid by dunking a spoon in the mixture; again, it should coat the
  spoon with a thin film. Adjust by adding milk.
  
  Using at least two and up to four 7 to 8-inch nonstick pans, spray
  with oil, and heat the pans over medium-high heat. Pour about one cup
  of batter to coat one pan. Once covered, pour the batter out and into
  the next heated pan, pouring the remainder back into the pitcher or
  bowl. The thin layer of batter that remains on the pans will make a
  smooth, flexible crepe. When the crepes pull away from the edge of
  the pan (10 to 30 seconds), remove from the heat, tap them lightly or
  run a knife across the edge of the pan to release, and invert the
  crepes on a dry towel to cool. Stir the batter at brief intervals to
  re-suspend the ingredients.

      Title: Ricotta Mascarpone Blintzes With Rhubarb-Strawberry Compo
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      6 oz Ricotta cheese
      6 oz Mascarpone
      1 ts Sugar
    3/4 ts Vanilla extract or orange
           Liquor
      1 ts Lemon zest
        pn Salt
      6 c  Rhubarb, cut into 1-inch
           Pieces
      3 c  Strawberries, cut in half
           Lengthwise
      3 tb Flour
      2 c  Sugar
           Lemon juice to taste
 
  Mix together the ricotta, mascarpone, sugar, vanilla extract, lemon
  zest and a small pinch of salt.
  
  With the cooked side in, place the "tail" of the crepe toward you and
  spoon about 2 ounces of the filling inside the center of the wrapper.
  Fold and hold the two opposite sides of the crepe over the filling
  until they almost meet and then fold the "tail" over the ingredients
  pulling the stuffing toward you. Fold the crepe over until you form a
  seam on the blintz. Set finished 2-inch by 1 1/2-inch flat "eggroll"
  shaped blintz on a dry towel with the seam side down.
  
  Melt butter or margarine in a skillet over medium high heat,
  beginning with the seam side down. Saute each blintz until golden
  brown, carefully so the cheese does not escape. Flip the blintz onto
  the other side. To warm the ingredients in the blintz, lower the
  flame and cook slowly, about 2 to 5 minutes to avoid burning the
  crepe.
  
  Gently toss the rhubarb, strawberries, flour, sugar and lemon and let
  stand until moist, 5 to 10 minutes. In a large saucepan, melt the
  butter and add the fruit mixture. Cook the fruit for approximately 35
  minutes, stirring to make sure the fruit does not brown. Cover 5
  minutes or until rhubarb is soft. Ladle the warm fruit over the
  blintz and top with a dollop of whipped cream. Garnish with a fresh
  strawberry half.

  medium disk of a food mill into a bowl and beat in sour cream and
  salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Remove skin from duck legs and cut into 1/4-inch strips. In a small
  heavy skillet cook skin in 1 tablespoon butter over moderately low
  heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp and transfer cracklings with
  a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain.
  
  Remove meat from duck legs and chop fine. Add garlic to fat remaining
  in skillet and cook over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally,
  until softened. Add meat to skillet and cook over moderate heat,
  stirring occasionally, until heated through. Stir in salt and pepper
  to taste. Stir meat mixture into potato mixture and cool. Filling may
  be made 1 day ahead and chilled, covered.
  
  Put 1 wrapper on a lightly floured surface and mound 1 tablespoon
  filling in center. Top filling with 1 parsley leaf. Lightly brush
  edges of wrapper with water and put a second wrapper over first,
  pressing down around filling to force out air and sealing edges well.
  Trim excess dough with a round cutter or sharp knife. Make more
  ravioli with remaining wrappers, filling, and parsley in same manner,
  transferring as formed to a dry kitchen towel and turning
  occasionally to dry slightly.
  
  In a kettle of gently boiling salted water cook ravioli in 2 batches 2
  minutes, or until they rise to surface and are tender. Do not let
  water boil vigorously once ravioli have been added. Transfer ravioli
  as cooked with a slotted spoon to a dry kitchen towel to drain and
  keep warm.
  
  While ravioli are cooking, in the small heavy skillet cook remaining 2
  tablespoons butter over moderate heat, swirling skillet occasionally,
  until nut brown in color. Remove skillet from heat and stir in
  truffle oil and paste.
  
  Arrange 4 or 5 ravioli on each of 6 heated plates and spoon truffle
  sauce on top. Garnish each serving with cracklings and parsley leaves.

      Title: Chili Bacon Breadsticks
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     30    Thin slices bacon (about 1
           Pound)
     30    Whole grissini (long thin
           Breadsticks)
    1/3 c  Firmly packed light brown
           Sugar
      3 tb Pure chili powder
           (preferably New Mexican*)
 
  * Kitchen Market - 888-468-4433
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  
  Let bacon stand at room temperature to soften slightly, about 10
  minutes. Wrap one bacon slice gently in a spiral around each
  breadstick and arrange on a tray. Breadsticks may be wrapped 4 hours
  ahead and chilled, covered.
  
  In a shallow dish long enough to fit breadsticks stir together sugar
  and chili powder until combined well, pressing out any lumps with the
  back of a fork. Alternatively, sugar mixture may be forced through a
  small sieve into a bowl and returned to dish.
  
  Roll each breadstick gently in mixture, coating bacon well, and
  arrange about 1/2-inch apart on rack of a broiler pan.
  
  Bake breadsticks 20 minutes, or until coating is caramelized and
  bacon is deep golden. Loosen breadsticks gently from rack with a
  metal spatula and cool until firm enough to pick up, 10 to 15
  minutes. Bacon will become crisp and breadsticks will harden as they
  cool.
  
  Serve breadsticks at room temperature.

      Title: Best And Easiest Home-Baked Bread
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Starter:
      2 c  Warm tap water, about 110
           Degrees
    1/4 ts Dry yeast
      2 c  (about 9 ounces) unbleached,
           All-purpose flour or whole
           Wheat flour
           Sponge:
    3/4 c  Warm tap water, about 110
           Degrees
    1/2 ts Dry yeast
      1 c  Risen starter, above
      2 c  (about 9 ounces) unbleached,
           All-purpose flour
           Dough:
           All the sponge, above
  1 1/2    To 1 3/4 cups (about 7 to 8
           Ounces) unbleached,
           All-purpose flour
      2 ts Salt
           Cornmeal for the bottom of
           The loaf
 
  For the starter, place warm water in a glass or stainless steel bowl
  and whisk in yeast. Stir in flour and cover with plastic wrap. Set
  aside to rise at room temperature until doubled and bubbly from 2 to
  8 hours, depending on room temperature.
  
  For the sponge, place warm water in a glass or stainless steel bowl
  and whisk in yeast. Whisk in starter, stir in flour smoothly, and
  cover with plastic wrap. Allow to rise until about triple in volume,
  about 4 to 8 hours (I like to do this late at night and allow it to
  rise all night). Stir sponge to deflate and stir in smaller amount of
  flour and salt. Knead dough by hand to form a smooth, elastic and
  slightly sticky dough, about 5 minutes, incorporating the remaining
  flour a tablespoon at a time if the dough is too soft.
  
  To mix the dough in the food processor, place sponge, smaller amount
  of flour and salt in work bowl fitted with metal blade. Pulse
  repeatedly until dough forms a ball (if dough will not form ball, add
  remaining flour a tablespoon at a time, and pulse until dough forms
  ball. Let dough rest 5 minutes, then let machine run continuously for
  20 seconds.
  
  To mix dough in heavy-duty mixer, place sponge, smaller amount of
  flour and salt in bowl of mixer fitted with dough hook. Mix on low
  speed to form a smooth, elastic and slightly sticky dough, about 5
  minutes, incorporating the remaining flour a tablespoon at a time if
  the dough is too soft.
  
  Oil a bowl and turn dough into it. Turn dough over so that top is
  oiled and cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Allow dough to rise
  until double. Line a round basket or 2-quart bowl with a napkin or
  tea towel and flour the cloth generously. Remove dough from bowl,
  press it to deflate, and shape it into a sphere by tucking bottom
  under and in toward center all the way around. Invert the dough into
  the cloth-lined basket or bowl so tucked-under edges are on top.
  Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise until doubled, about an
  hour.
  
  When the loaf is almost risen, preheat oven to 500 degrees and set a
  rack at the middle level. Place a heavy cookie sheet or jelly roll
  pan or a baking stone on the rack. Sprinkle the top of the loaf with
  cornmeal and invert it onto a piece of cardboard or a peel. Holding a
  razor blade at a 30-degree angle to the loaf, quickly slash a cross
  in the top. Slide the loaf off the peel onto the pan and lower oven
  temperature to 450 degrees. Bake the loaf for about 45 minutes, or
  until it reaches an internal temperature of 210 degrees. Cool the
  loaf on a rack and do not cut it until it is completely cooled.
  
  Variations:
  
  PART WHOLE WHEAT BREAD: Make the starter with whole wheat flour and
  the sponge and dough with white flour. Or, if you make the starter
  with white flour, substitute 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups
  white flour in the sponge; and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 to 1
  1/4 cups white flour in the dough.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      5 c  Unbleached, all-purpose
           Flour
    1/3 c  Sugar
      2 ts Salt
      1 c  Warm tap water, about 110
           Degrees
  2 1/2 ts (1 envelope) active dry
           Yeast
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      2 lg Eggs
      1    Egg yolk
           Egg Wash:
      1    Egg well beaten with a pinch
           Salt
 
  Heavy cookie sheet or jelly roll pan lined with parchment
  
  Place flour, sugar and salt in the work bowl of a food processor
  fitted with a metal blade. Pulse until mixed. Place water in a mixing
  bowl and whisk in yeast. Whisk in oil, eggs and yolk. Add liquid to
  work bowl and pulse 8 or 10 times until dough forms a ball. Let rest
  for 5 minutes, then run machine continuously for 30 seconds. Turn
  dough out onto floured work surface (you may need the help of a
  scraper). Knead dough lightly to form a ball. Invert into oiled bowl
  and turn to coat all sides with oil. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and
  allow dough to rise at room temperature until doubled. Turn risen
  dough out onto floured work surface and press with palms of hands to
  deflate. Divide dough into 3 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a
  cylinder, about 12 to 15 inches long. Arrange strands side by side on
  prepared pan. Begin to braid in the middle of the strands and braid
  to one end. Turn the pan around and braid from the middle to the
  other end. (Braiding from the middle outward helps keep the loaf a
  consistent width.) Pinch each end to seal the strands together and
  turn the pinched parts under the loaf. Cover with oiled plastic wrap
  and allow to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
  
  When loaf is almost doubled, preheat oven to 400 degrees and set a
  rack at the middle level.
  
  Brush top and sides of risen loaf with egg wash. Bake for 20 to 25
  minutes or until top is golden brown and internal temperature of loaf
  reaches about 210 degrees. Transfer to rack to cool.
  
  For a darker, shinier finish, remove braid from oven after it has
  risen and is firm (make sure that the loaf is firm or it may deflate)
  and beginning to color; gently repeat egg wash and return loaf to
  oven immediately.

    3/4    -inch loaf pan, buttered
 
  Place oatmeal in a heat-proof bowl and pour boiling water over it.
  Stir once to mix, then set aside until cooled to room temperature. To
  make the dough place 1/2 cup water in a small bowl and whisk in
  yeast. Combine flour, brown sugar and salt in work bowl of food
  processor fitted with metal blade. Pulse until mixed. Add butter and
  continue to pulse until mixture is a fine powder with no visible
  pieces of butter. Remove metal blade and fit plastic blade. Add
  cooled oatmeal mixture and yeast mixture and pulse until the mixture
  forms a ball. Allow the machine to run continuously for 15 seconds.
  
  To mix dough in a heavy-duty mixer, combine flour, brown sugar and
  salt in mixer bowl and stir to mix. Cut butter into 12 pieces, and
  add to the flour along with the oatmeal and yeast mixtures; mix on
  low speed with dough hook until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5
  minutes.
  
  To mix the dough by hand, stir together flour, brown sugar and salt
  in a mixing bowl. Rub butter in by hand, then add oatmeal mixture and
  yeast mixture. Stir to form a rough dough, then turn out onto a
  lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic,
  about 5 minutes. Place dough in a buttered bowl and turn to coat all
  sides. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and allow dough to rise until
  doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
  
  Turn risen dough out onto a floured work surface (you may need the
  help of a scraper). Press dough with palms of hands to deflate. To
  form loaf, stretch dough into a rough rectangle, then fold in short
  ends until dough is approximately the length of the pan. Then fold
  far long edge down to middle. Fold remaining long edge over and
  compress to form a tight cylinder. Place the loaf in the pan, seam
  side down. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and allow dough to rise
  until doubled, about 1 hour. While the loaf is rising, preheat oven
  to 375 degrees and set a rack at the middle level.
  
  When the loaf is completely risen, place in oven and immediately lower
  temperature to 350 degrees. Bake about 30 to 40 minutes, until well
  risen and firm to the touch. The internal temperature of the bread
  with be about 210 degrees when it is done. Unmold the loaf to a rack
  to cool.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
    3/4 lb Russet or Baker's potatoes,
           Preferably old, unpeeled
    3/4    To 1 cup unbleached flour
      2    Egg yolks
           Salt to taste
           Simple tomato sauce of
           Choice
           Freshly grated Parmesan as
           An accompaniment, if
           Desired
 
  Bake potatoes 45 minutes at 375 degrees.
  
  Remove skins and force potatoes through the medium disk of a food
  mill into a bowl and beat in 3/4 to 1 cup of flour, 2 egg yolks and
  salt to taste. Transfer mixture to a lightly floured board and gently
  knead dough, adding additional flour, if necessary, to form a soft,
  smooth but slightly sticky dough. Do not overwork dough.
  
  Divide dough into three equal parts. Working with one piece of dough
  at a time roll it into a rope about 1 inch in diameter and cut it
  into 3/4-inch pieces. Gnocchi may be transferred to a lightly floured
  baking sheet and chilled for 30 minutes.
  
  The gnocchi can be cooked as is or they can be shaped.
  
  To shape gnocchi: Using a fork with rounded long, slim tines, and
  holding it parallel to counter, concave side facing you, press a
  piece of dough against the inside curve of the fork just below the
  prongs using your index finger. Flip dough away from tip of fork in
  the direction of the fork's handle
  
  In a large pot, bring 4 quarts water to a boil. Add salt to taste and
  enough gnocchi to cook without crowding the pan. Once gnocchi have
  floated to surface simmer for 10 to 15 seconds more, or until just
  firm. With a slotted spoon transfer gnocchi to a bowl. Cook remaining
  gnocchi in same manner and keep warm.
  
  Divide gnocchi among serving plates and nap with tomato sauce. Serve
  with freshly grated cheese.

           Masa harina
  2 3/4 c  Cold water
      1 ts Salt
           Stuffing:
      3 tb Olive oil
      1 md Onion, finely chopped
      1    Clove garlic, minced
      1    Jalapeno pepper, seeded and
           Finely chopped
      1 ts Ground cumin
      1 ts Coarse salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1 lg Tomato, peeled, seeded and
           Finely diced
    1/2 lb Potatoes, cooked and cut
           Into 1/4inch dice
      2 c  Fresh corn kernels (about 5
           Ears)
    1/2 bn Chopped Italian parsley
    1/2 c  Grated Anejo cheese
           Glaze:
      1    Egg white
      2 tb Water
    1/2 ts Coarse salt
 
  Combine the masa harina, water and salt in a large mixing bowl and
  stir until smooth. The dough should be slightly sticky and form a
  ball when pressed together. To test, flatten a small ball of dough
  between your palms. If the edges crack, add water to the dough, a
  tablespoon at a time, until a test piece does not crack. Cover with a
  damp towel until ready to use.
  
  Heat the oil in a large skillet over moderate heat. Add the onion and
  sautJ until soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Ad the garlic, jalapeno, cumin,
  salt and pepper and sautJ 1 minute longer to release the aromas. Add
  the tomato, potatoes and corn and cook, stirring occasionally, until
  the liquid from the tomatoes is absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from
  the heat, stir in the parsley and cheese and correct the seasoning.
  Set aside to cool.
  
  Divide the dough into 24 golfball size pieces, moistening your hands
  with water to prevent sticking if necessary. Flatten balls to 3 inch
  disks. Place a heaping teaspoon of stuffing on the empanada and close
  by pressing the edges together with your fingers. Shape into a half
  moon. Repeat until all the halfmoons are formed. Preheat the oven to
  375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange
  the empanaditas on top. Brush with the glaze and prick with a fork to
  make steam holes. Bake for about 2530 minutes, or until golden.
  Remove and transfer to a rack to cool slightly. Serve warm.

      Title: Sardine And Swiss Chard Pastelitos
 Categories: Toohot
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Allpurpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      4 tb (1/4 cup) lard, chilled
      4 tb (1/4 cup) butter, chilled
      2    Egg yolks
      4 tb Cold water
      1    Egg
           Filling:
      2    (4ounce) cans sardines,
           Drained
    1/4 c  Fresh lime juice
    1/2 bn Chopped fresh cilantro
      1 lb Swiss chard, washed and
           Coarsely chopped
      2 tb Butter
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 md Onion, finely chopped
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      2    Jalapeno peppers, seeded and
           Finely chopped
      1 ts Coarse salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1    Egg, beaten
      1 tb Water
 
  Sift the flour with the salt into a large bowl. Cut the lard and
  butter into little pieces and rub into the flour until it resembles
  coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center of the flour and stir in the
  egg yolks. Add the cold water a tablespoon at a time until the dough
  is soft but not sticky. Cover with plastic and refrigerate at least 1
  hour.
  
  Mash the sardines with the lime juice and cilantro and set aside.
  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and immerse the Swiss
  chard in the boiling water for a few seconds. Drain thoroughly and
  squeeze dry. Chop the chard, both leaves and stems, and set aside.
  
  Heat the butter and olive oil in a large skillet over moderate heat.
  Add the onion and sautJ until soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic,
  jalapeno and salt and pepper, and sautJ another minute to release the
  aromas. Add the Swiss chard and cook until blended. Remove from the
  heat, season with salt to taste and set aside.
  
  Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to 1/8inch thickness.
  Use a round cookie cutter to cut 1520 circles about 1inch larger than
  the circumference of muffin or cupcake tins. (The muffin tins should
  be about 2 1/2inches in diameter). Use another round cutter to cut
  the same number of circles the same size as the tins. Press the
  larger circles into the tins.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Add enough of the Swiss chard
  mixture to each tin to come about two thirds of the way up the tin.
  Divide the sardine filling among the tins. Whisk together the egg and
  water. Moisten the edges of the pastry with a little of the egg wash.
  Cover the filling with the smaller circles of pastry and seal the
  edges, pressing together with your fingers. Brush the tops with more
  of the egg wash and bake for 30 minutes, or until golden.

      Title: Fried Quince Empanadas
 Categories: Toohot
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 lg Ripe plantains, unpeeled
      5 lg Ripe quince
           Juice of 1 lemon
      1 tb Unsalted butter
      1 c  Light brown sugar
      1 tb Grated fresh ginger
           Zest and juice of 1 orange
    1/8 ts Ground cloves
    1/8 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 c  Dark rum
    1/2 c  Walnuts, coarsely chopped
      1 ts Salt
           Vegetable oil for
           Deepfrying
           Powdered sugar
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cut a lengthwise slit in each
  plantain and set on a baking sheet. Bake until the flesh is
  thoroughly soft and oozing through the slit, 40-50 minutes. Set aside
  to cool.
  
  Meanwhile, make the stuffing: Peel, core and finely chop 3 of the
  quinces. Peel and core the remaining 2 quinces and cut each into 8
  wedges. Drop the wedges into a bowl of cold water to cover and
  squeeze in the lemon juice.
  
  Melt the butter in a small saucepan over moderate heat. Add the brown
  sugar and cook, stirring, until the sugar has melted. Add the finely
  chopped quinces, ginger, orange zest, cloves and cinnamon and stir to
  combine. Add 1 cup of water and continue cooking until most of the
  liquid is gone, about 15 minutes. Add the orange juice and rum and
  cook until almost all of the liquid is gone, about 5 minutes. Drain
  the quince wedges and add to the pan. Reduce the heat, cover and cook
  until the wedges are just soft, about 8 minutes. Remove the pan from
  the heat, stir in the walnuts and let cool. (The stuffing can be make
  a day in advance and refrigerated).
  
  Make the dough in a food processor with a paddle attachment: Peel,
  trim and discard any tough ends from the plantains. Combine the
  plantains and salt and pulse until a smooth puree is formed, or mix
  until just blended. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate about 2 hours.
  
  To assemble: Roll 2 tablespoons of the dough between your palms to
  form a ball. Line the bottom of a tortilla press with a small plastic
  bag and place the ball of dough in the center. Place another plastic
  bag over the dough and press to form a 3 1/2inch circle. Place a
  quince wedge on half of the dough circle and top it with a teaspoon
  of the sauce. Fold over to enclose the quince and press the edges to
  seal. Place the stuffed empanadas on a platter and chill at least 30
  minutes.
  
  Heat the vegetable oil to 375 degrees F. Gently drop the empanadas
  into the hot oil and fry until golden, about 6 minutes. With a
  slotted spoon, remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.
  Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve hot.

      2    Bay leaves
      2 c  Soft bread crumbs
      1 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      2    Onions, finely chopped
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      1 ts Ground cumin
      1 tb Yellow Aji, Amarillo or
           Chile powder
    1/3 c  Finely chopped or ground
           Walnuts
      1 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
      2 lb Small potatoes, boiled,
           Peeled and halved
      4    Hard-boiled eggs, halved
           Chopped parsley for garnish
 
  Place chicken in a large pot and fill with water to halfway up sides
  of bird. Add leek, onion, carrot, tomato, salt, peppercorns and bay
  leaves. Cover, bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 45
  minutes, or until chicken is done. Remove chicken and place in a bowl
  until cool enough to remove the meat from the bones and shred into
  bitesize pieces. Meanwhile, strain broth and reserve 4 cups.
  
  Soak the bread in the milk. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium
  heat. Add the onions and sautJ until soft and golden, about 10
  minutes. Add the garlic and cumin and sautJ for 1 more minute. Add
  softened bread and aji or chile powder, and cook for about 1 minute,
  stirring. (For a creamier sauce, place onionbread mixture in a
  blender, puree until smooth and return to skillet.) Add 2 cups of the
  chicken stock and continue cooking until sauce thickens and coats the
  back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.
  
  Add the chicken and simmer for 5 to 8 more minutes, adding more stock
  if needed. Stir in the walnuts and Parmesan cheese, and simmer gently
  for another 5 minutes, or until thickened slightly. To serve, spoon
  chicken and sauce onto a serving platter and surround with potatoes
  and eggs. Sprinkle with chopped parsley.

      2    Fresh quince or green apples
           Washed and chopped with

      2    Cinnamon sticks
      8    Whole cloves
           Juice of 1 lemon
  1 1/2 c  Sugar

  Soak the purple corn in the 10 cups of cold water overnight. Transfer
  the corn to a large pot and measure the soaking liquid. Add enough
  water to make 15 cups. Pour the liquid back over the corn, and add

  hours.
  
  Remove from the heat, remove the corn cobs and strain the mixture,
  pressing against the strainer with a spoon to extract all the juice
  from the fruits and spices. There should be about 8 cups of liquid.
  If not, place the corn and fruit in a saucepan with water just to
  cover and simmer for about 20 minutes. Strain and add amount needed
  to total 8 cups. Discard the corn and fruit. Place the liquid in a
  heavy saucepan, reserving 1 cup of the liquid.
  
  Add the dried prunes, cherries and apricots to the 7 cups of liquid.
  
  In a small bowl, combine the reserved 1 cup of liquid and the sweet
  potato flour or cornstarch. Mix thoroughly with a fork until
  dissolved. Pour this mixture back into the saucepan with the liquid
  and dried fruits. Bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking until
  the mixture is thick, about 25 minutes.
  
  Remove from the heat and pour the pudding into a deep 2 quart serving
  dish or individual ramekins. Let cool. To serve, dust the top with
  ground cinnamon.
  
  Serve the pudding with crema.

MMMMM----------------------CHEESECAKE CRUST---------------------------
      3 tb Butter; unsalted, softened
      3 tb Sugar
      1    Egg yolks
      1 c  Flour
    1/4 ts Baking powder
    1/8 ts Salt

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
     32 oz Cream cheese
      1 c  Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 ts Juice, lemon
      4    Eggs
      1    9" springform pan
      1    Jelly-roll pan; or roasting
           Pan
 
  CHEESECAKE CRUST: Cream together the butter and sugar until light and
  fluffy. Beat in the yolk until smooth. Combine the flour, baking
  powder and salt and gently fold into the butter mixture with a rubber
  spatula. Mixture will be crumbly.
  
  Variations:
  
  With Almonds: Add 1/2 cup finely chopped sliced or slivered almonds
  to the dry ingredients of Cheesecake Crust.
  
  With Pecans: Add 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans to dry ingredients of
  Cheesecake Crust.
  
  Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.
  Butter only the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan and line it with a
  round of parchment. Place the dough in the pan and pat it down evenly
  and firmly to cover the bottom. Bake for about 25 minutes, until
  dough is golden and baked through. Lower the oven temperature to 325
  degrees.
  
  All of the following should be done on your mixer's lowest speed. To
  make the filling, beat cream cheese smooth, no more than 30 seconds.
  Stop mixer and scrape bowl and beater. Add sugar in a stream, mixing
  for no more than
       30    seconds. Stop and scrape.
  
  Add vanilla, lemon juice and 1 egg; mix only until absorbed, no more
  than 30 seconds. Stop and scrape. Add remaining eggs, one at a time,
  mixing only until each is absorbed. Stop and scrape after each
  addition.
  
  Wrap aluminum foil around the bottom of the spring form pan so it
  comes at least one inch up the sides. Pour the filling into the pan
  over the crust. Place the pan in a jelly roll or roasting pan and
  pour warm water into pan to a depth of 1/2-inch. Bake the cheesecake
  for about 60 minutes, or until lightly colored and firm except for
  the very center. Remove from pan of hot water. Remove foil and cool
  completely on a rack. Wrap cheesecake and chill overnight before
  unmolding.

  1 1/2 lb Cream cheese; without

    1/2 c  Cream
      4    Egg whites
    2/3 c  Sugar

      1 tb Egg whites
    1/2 c  Sugar

MMMMM------------------------LEMON GLAZE-----------------------------
      2 tb Juice, lemon
    1/3 c  Water
      1 tb Gelatin
    2/3 c  Apple jelly
      1 dr Yellow food coloring
 
  For the dough, mix dry ingredients in a bowl and rub in butter with
  fingertips until very fine, but still cool and powdery. Whisk egg and
  vanilla and stir into dough with a fork. Press dough together in bowl
  and turn into a buttered 9-inch spring form pan. With floured
  fingertips, press dough evenly into pan bottom. Dock dough with a
  fork and bake at 350 degrees about 15 minutes, until golden. Cool the
  base in the pan.
  
  For the filling, combine the rum and lemon juice in a bowl and
  sprinkle the gelatin on the surface. Allow to soak for 5 minutes,
  then place the bowl over a small pan of gently simmering water to
  melt the gelatin, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the bowl from the pan
  and cool the gelatin slightly.
  
  Beat the cream cheese by machine until it is soft and light, scraping
  the bowl and beaters often. Beat in the cream smoothly. Set aside the
  cream cheese mixture. Combine the egg whites and sugar in the bowl of
  an electric mixer and heat over simmering water, whisking constantly
  until the egg whites are hot and the sugar is dissolved. Beat on
  mixer with whip until cold and firm. Beat 1/4 of the cream cheese
  mixture into the dissolved gelatin, then beat the gelatin mixture
  into the remaining cream cheese. Fold in the meringue. Pour the
  filling into the prepared pan and refrigerate to set, about 6 hours
  or overnight.
  
  For the almonds, combine almonds and egg white in a roasting pan and
  rub between palms of hands to coat evenly. Add sugar and stir in.
  Bake at 325 degrees about 20 minutes, stirring often, until well
  toasted and sugar has caramelized slightly. Cool and store in a tin
  or jar at room temperature.
  
  For glaze, combine juice, water and gelatin and allow to soak. Bring
  jelly to a boil and add gelatin mixture; bring to a boil and remove
  from heat. Cool and pour onto chilled cheesecake. Unmold cheesecake
  and press sugared almonds around side.

  Mezze, maza, meze, mezeler, mezedes, mezza, mezethakia, meza, al
  mezah: There are as many different names for mezze as there are
  languages along the eastern rim of the Mediterranean, and there are
  as many different mezze dishes as there are cooks to invent them.
  Mezze is a way of eating; as with tapas or antipasti, almost anything
  that is small and tasty qualifies as a mezze dish, even main dishes
  if they can be served in small portions. Mezze dishes are often
  served as hors d'oeuvres to accompany drinks, or set out as a first
  course. But when served with plenty of fresh warm flatbreads, even
  the most humble array can instantly become a meal. And the mezze
  table is one of the all-time great ways of giving bread a central
  role in a meal, whether a simple home-style supper or a dazzling
  festive spread.
  
  A basic mezze meal can be as simple as a basket of warm pita, a plate
  of fresh herbs, another of feta cheese or yogurt cheese, a dish of
  olives, and a pitcher of iced water.  Add a dip or salsa, a salad or
  two, and a grill such as Grilled Marinated Chicken, and a simple
  light meal becomes a more elaborate dinner.
  
  Keep in mind that whatever is served should be easy to pick up or to
  eat with flatbreads.  Place all the breads and dishes on the table at
  the same time.  There are no courses in a mezze meal, no rules about
  what must be eaten first and what later.  Think of a long summer
  night on the Mediterranean with plenty of time to eat, to talk, and
  to eat some more. A mezze meal should be as informal and relaxing as
  it is delicious.
  
  To give a mezze meal the status of a mezze feast, simply increase the
  number and variety of dishes, including perhaps a few heartier
  choices like kebabs or one or two bean dishes.  When making your
  selections about what to serve, think also about how the table will
  be arranged, about colors and shapes, contrasts and complements.
  Place a rich red salsa beside a pale cream-colored dip, a white feta
  next to the black olives, an orange or a carrot salat near a plate of
  fresh green herbs.

      Title: Afghan Home-style Naan
 Categories: Bread, Breadmaker, Tested
      Yield: 6 Naan
 
           -Herat, Afghanistan, Asia

MMMMM----------------FLATBREADS AND FLAVORS; ALFO---------------------
      2 ts Yeast
    1/2 c  Water; warm
      1 c  Yogurt; well-chilled
      1 c  Water; boiling
      3 c  Flour, whole wheat; hard
      2 tb Oil, corn; or safflower
      2 ts Salt
      3 c  Flour, whole wheat; hard

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
      6 tb Sesame seeds
 
  15 minutes mix, 30 minutes rest, 20 minutes mix, 1 hr rest, 10 minutes
  roll, 10 minutes rest, then per naan 5 minutes roll & 5 minutes cook.
  
  You will need a large bread bowl, a medium-sized bowl, unglazed quarry
  tiles to fit on a rack in your oven or a baking sheet at least
  10"x14", a baker's peel or another large baking sheet, a rolling pin,
  and a razor blade or sharp knife.
  
  Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in a large bowl.  Stir to
  dissolve.
  
  Stir boiling water into yogurt in medium bowl.  Let cool to tepid (105
  F-115 F).
  
  Stir yogurt mixture into yeast mixture.  Stir in flour, 1/2-cup at a
  time. Then stir for 2 minutes in the same direction.  You now have a
  sponge. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand 30 minutes.
  
  Sprinkle oil and salt onto sponge.  Mix in enough of remaining flour,
  1/2 cup at a time, to form a dough.  Turn out onto lightly floured
  surface and knead until smooth and elastic, adding more flour if
  dough is sticky, about
       10    minutes.
  
  Wash out and lightly oil the large bowl.  Add dough, turning to coat
  entire surface.  Cover with damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and
  let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
  
  Position a rack in lower third of oven and arrange quarry tiles on
  rack, leaving 1" space between tiles and oven walls.  Or place
  10"x14" (or larger) baking sheet in oven to preheat.
  
  Punch dough down.  Divide into one piece per naan.  Using lightly
  floured hands, flatten each piece on lightly floured work surface
  into 4"-5" round. Cover rounds with kitchen towel or plastic wrap and
  let rest 10 minutes.
  
  Preheat oven to 450 F.  Lightly flour baker's peel or back side of
  large baking sheet.  Working with one dough round at a time, roll out
  on lightly floured surface until dough begins to stretch, keeping
  remaining dough covered.  Brush flour from work surface and sprinkle
  1 tb sesame seeds onto work surface.  Lay dough on seeds and roll out
  into 6"x10" rectangle. Turn dough over. Using razor blade or tip of a
  shart knife, cut five 1"-long slits evenly spaced around the dough,
  radiating from the center like sun rays or flower petals.  Slice
  dough onto baker's peel or prepared sheet. Then slide dough onto
  quarry tiles or preheated baking sheet and bake until top begins to
  brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer bread to rack. Repeat with remaining
  dough rounds and sesame seeds.  Serve warm or at room temperature.
  
  Authors' comments: This Afghan home-style bread is a classic Central
  Asian naan, delicious on its own or as an accompaniment to almost any
  meal. Unlike Afghan Snowshoe Naan, which is much thinner, this bread
  is thick, soft, and almost rich in taste.
  
  Sylvia's comments: as usual, I substituted regular bread flour for the
  whole wheat flour and let the breadmachine mix the sponge (with tap
  water, didn't bother with boiling/cold water, it's easier to let the
  machine warm the ingredients) and knead the dough, letting it rest
  right in the breadmachine.  My 1-1/2 lb Zojirushi S-15A mixed all the
  ingredients for 6 naan just fine.  The only problem is that I left
  the house and let it rise more than 2 hours instead of just 1.
  Needless to say, when I got home I had to peel off the dough that had
  overflowed all over the place! I had trouble getting the sesame seeds
  to stick. If I used enough flour to keep it from sticking to the
  table, it was too dry on the bottom to hold the sesame seeds.  I
  sprinkled them over the top and rolled them in, but that didn't stick
  well, either. I finally adapted a trick from another naan recipe and
  brushed the top with ghee after cutting the slits, then sprinkled the
  sesame seeds on top. I had to cook them 6-7 minutes to get then to
  start browning, with or without ghee on top.  They were good, but I
  think I prefer smaller, more manageable naan.

      2 tb Black peppercorns, cracked
      6 c  Rendered duck or pork fat
     12    Garlic cloves, peeled
     12    Fresh thyme sprigs
 
  Remove ducks' legs and breasts, saving remaining bones and wings for

  just fall off fork when shaken.
  
  Transfer duck pieces to a medium baking dish and add the fat. Let
  cool to room temperature, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at
  least 24 hours or as long as 4 weeks. Before serving, lift duck
  pieces out of fat. Remove and discard skin and any excess fat by
  warming slightly on a rack in the oven. Serve duck hot or cold.

      2    (5pound) ducks
           Salt and freshly ground
           Black pepper
    1/4 c  Rendered duck fat or oil
     16 md Shallots, thinly sliced
      8    Garlic cloves, minced
      2 tb Freshly grated ginger
    1/4 c  Thai red curry paste
      5 c  Brown duck stock or chicken
           Stock
    1/4 c  Fish sauce
     14 oz Coconut milk
      3 tb Palm sugar or brown sugar
    1/4 c  Fresh lime juice
      2 bn Cilantro, chopped, stems
           Trimmed
      2    Limes, peeled and diced

           Green part, trimmed, thinly
           Sliced
           Along diagonal
 
  Bone ducks and remove the skin. (You can ask a butcher to do this,
  reserving the carcass for stock making and skin for rendering.) Cut
  breasts in half, then into about 3 pieces across the width. Chop legs
  and thighs into about 4 pieces each. (Remember: You want to start
  with generous pieces of meat, since they will shrink when cooked.
  Don't worry about cleaning the tendons, since they will soften with
  long cooking.) Sprinkle meat with salt and pepper.
  
  Heat rendered fat in a large, heavy bottomed Dutch oven over high
  heat. Brown duck on all sides, then transfer meat to a platter.
  Reduce heat to medium low and cook shallots until well browned, about
  15 minutes. Add garlic and ginger, increase heat to medium high and
  cook about a minute, then add curry paste. Cook, stirring constantly,
  about 3 minutes. Return duck meat to pot along with brown duck stock
  and cook at a slow simmer, uncovered, until meat is tender, about 40
  minutes.
  
  With a slotted spoon, transfer meat to a platter and reserve in a warm
  place. Puree sauce in a blender and strain back into pot. Cook over
  high heat until liquid is reduced by one third. Stir in fish sauce,
  coconut milk, sugar, and lime juice, and remove from heat. Stir duck
  back into warm sauce. Ladle stew over Jasmine Rice. Garnish with
  remaining ingredients and serve immediately.

      4 lb Veal shoulder cut into 1
           Inch cubes, patted dry
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      3 tb Butter
      2    Carrots, finely cubed
      1 lg Onion, thinly sliced
      1    Stalk celery finely minced
      2    Cloves minced garlic
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
           Beef broth or veal stock
      1 tb Or so of beurre manie,
           (paste made in equal
           Proportions of

MMMMM-----------------------BOUQUET GARNI----------------------------
           Parsley
           Bay leaf
           Peppercorns
 
  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
  
  In an oven proof casserole, heat, until very hot, half of the oil. In
  small batches brown the veal cubes on all sides. When one batch is
  done, add more oil if you need to and continue to brown until all the
  veal is done. Discard the fat in the casserole and replace it with
  the butter. Add the carrot, onion and celery, cover and simmer 5
  minutes or until onions are translucent. Add the white wine and boil
  down for a minute or until alcohol has evaporated. Return the veal
  cubes to the casserole with garlic and add just enough broth to
  barely cover the veal. Bring the liquid to a boil, add the bouquet
  garni, put a buttered piece of parchment or brown paper on top of the
  meat, then a lid on the casserole and set in the oven. Cook for 1 1/4
  to 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is tender.
  
  Remove casserole from the oven and strain the contents through a
  sieve and the liquid into another saucepan; discard bouquet garni.
  Divide solids into 2 batches. Degrease the liquid and boil it down
  until reduced to 3 cups. Remove 1 1/2 cups of the liquid and add it
  to half of the meat. Return the other half of the veal to the
  remaining liquid. Season with salt and pepper. Thicken with beurre
  manie if you wish. Serve with rice, polenta or potatoes; garnish with
  parsley.

      Title: Pine Nut Cake
 Categories: Try it
      Yield: 8 servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------TASTE #TS4731----------------------------
      4    Eggs, separated
    3/4 c  Plus 2 tablespoons sugar
      2 ts Vanilla
  1 1/4 c  Sifted cake flour
      4 tb Tepid melted butter

MMMMM------------------------BUTTERCREAM-----------------------------
    2/3 c  Sugar
      3    Egg yolks
      1    Stick butter, room
           Temperature
      2 tb Sherry (medium-sweet)
      1 ts Vanilla
  1 1/2 c  Toasted pine nuts
    1/2 c  Warm strained apricot
           Preserves
      2 c  Heavy cream whipped with 2
           TB sugar
 
  Make cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour a 10-inch
  round cake pan, 2 inches deep. In a large mixing bowl lightly beat
  egg yolks and gradually beat in 3/4 cup sugar. Add vanilla and
  continue to beat 2 minutes more, or until mixture is thick, pale
  yellow and forms a ribbon when beaters are lifted.
  
  In a separate bowl beat egg whites with a pinch of salt to soft peaks.
  Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of sugar and continue to beat until stiff
  peaks form. Scoop one-quarter of whites onto yolk mixture, sift
  one-quarter of flour over and delicately fold together until
  partially blended. Add one-third of remaining whites, sift one-third
  of remaining flour over and delicately fold together until partially
  blended. Add half of remaining whites, sift half of remaining flour
  over, add half of melted butter and delicately fold until partially
  blended. Add remaining butter and delicately fold until egg whites
  are no longer visible, but do not loose their volume.
  
  Turn batter into prepared pan and smooth top, tilting pan. Bake in
  center of oven for 30 to 35 minutes, until lightly browned, puffed
  and edges are beginning to pull away from sides of pan. Remove from
  oven and let cake stand in pan on a rack for 5 minutes. Run a knife
  around edge, invert pan to remove cake and reverse again onto a cake
  rack, puffed side up. Cool for 2 hours.
  
  Make buttercream: In small saucepan heat sugar with 1/2 cup water,
  stirring, until sugar dissolves. Place a candy thermometer in sugar
  syrup and continue to cook, without stirring, until it registers 236
  degrees F. Wash down any sugar crystals which form on sides with a
  pastry brush dipped in cold water. Meanwhile, in top of a double
  boiler or in a large bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water,
  beat egg yolks with an electric mixer until frothy. Slowly pour in
  sugar syrup in a thin stream, continuing to beat until smooth. Remove
  from heat and continue beating until completely cooled. Add butter, 1
  tablespoon at a time, beating until smooth and creamy. Beat in
  vanilla and sherry. Cover tightly and chill until firm but still of
  spreading consistency.
  
  To assemble, slice cake in half horizontally. Sprinkle cut sides of
  both halves with remaining sherry. Spread buttercream on bottom half,
  sprinkle with 1/4 cup of pine nuts, and replace top cake half. Brush
  outer rim of cake with warm apricot preserves and gently press on
  pine nuts. Let cake sit for 1 hour. Up to 1 hour before serving,
  decorate top of cake with whipped cream and sprinkle with remaining
  pine nuts.

      2 tb Butter
      4    Plum tomatoes, seeded and
           Finely chopped
      2 tb Minced dill fronds
 
  (Start with 4 steaks so you have enough for next day, second time
  around).
  
  Arrange salmon steaks, over dill stalks, in a single layer a shallow
  skillet wide enough to accommodate them without crowding. Season with
  salt and pepper. Add enough wine and water to completely cover

 Categories: Try it

MMMMM----------------CHEF DU JOUR MARVIN WOODS #D---------------------

MMMMM-------------------------STOCK BASE------------------------------
      4 qt Water
      2 lb Shrimp shells
      2    Onions, chopped
      4    Stalks celery, chopped
      1    Carrot, chopped
      8 oz Stewed tomatoes
      1    Bay leaf
      1 tb Chili paste (or 1 jalapeno
           With slits in the side)

MMMMM----------------------------STEW---------------------------------
      2 oz Garlic cloves, crushed
      2 oz Shallots, minced
      1    Red pepper, finely diced
      1    Green pepper, finely diced
    1/2 c  Oil
    1/4 bn Kale
    1/4 bn Mustard greens
      2 oz Thyme
      2 oz Sage
      2 oz Rosemary
    1/2 lb Duck sausage
     12    Jumbo shrimp
      2    Tomatoes; skinned, seeded,
           And finely diced
      4    Corn on the cob; preboiled
    1/2 lb Lentils; precooked
    1/3 c  Rice; cooked white
 
  This dish gets its name from the city where it originated - Frogmore,
  South Carolina. The original version of this Low Country seafood stew
  calls only for shellfish stock, shrimp, and corn on the cob (no
  frogs, thank you). My interpretation, a somewhat heartier concoction
  made so with the additions of lentil, rice, peppers, kale, mustard
  greens and duck sausage, is a Cafe Buelah favorite.
  
  Combine all ingredients in a stock pot and bring to a boil. Reduce
  heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Strain and set aside.
  
  Stew: In a large saute pan over moderate heat, sweat garlic, shallots
  and peppers in the oil. Add greens, herbs, and duck sausage. Cook on
  medium flame for 5 minutes. Add shrimp and cook for about 1 1/2
  minutes. Add tomatoes, stock base, and corn on the cob. Cook another
  5 minutes, then add precooked lentils. Cook for 30 seconds. Remove
  pan and set aside. Pour hot stock into 4 large soup bowls. Combine
  rice and stew ingredients, dividing up quantities evenly into each
  bowl.

           Sherry
      4 tb Coarse salt
      4 ts Sugar
      1 ts Freshly-ground black pepper
      4 c  Fresh tarragon leaves
     64    Very thin asparagus spears,
           Ends peeled

MMMMM---------------------AMONTILLADO SAUCE--------------------------
    3/4 c  Amontillado sherry
    1/2 c  Mayonnaise
      2 tb Dijon mustard
    1/4 c  Walnut oil
    1/2 c  Neutral-flavored vegetable
           Oil, such as canola or
           Sunflower
 
  Place salmon, skin-side down in a glass baking dish. Rub with sherry.
  In a mortar grind together salt, sugar and pepper lightly with a
  pestle. Coat flesh side of salmon with salt mixture. Strew tarragon
  over salmon, distributin it evenly. Top with another glass dish and
  weight it with cans. Refrigerate for 48 hours, basting a few times
  with accumulated liquid.
  
  Cook asparagus in boiling, salted water until just tender, 2 to 3
  minutes. Refresh under cold water, then pat dry. Set aside at room
  temperature.
  
  Prepare sauce: In a small saucepan bring sherry to a boil and reduce
  it by one-third. Let cool slightly, then pour into workbowl of a food
  processor with mayonnaise and mustard. Process for 5 seconds. Combine
  walnut and vegetabl oils and, with the motor running, slowly begin to
  add to sherry mixture drop by drop. After 1 tablespoon of oil has
  been absorbed, you can begin to pour it slowly in a thin stream.
  Process to a medium consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper
  and set aside at room temperature.
  
  Remove tarragon from salmon and wash off brine under cold water. With
  a very sharp knife, cut salmon into broad, thin slices. Divide among
  dinner plates. Pour a little sauce alongside. Top decoratively with
  asparagus. Grind black pepper over and serve immediately.

      Title: Pan-Fried Dumplings
 Categories: Emeril
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           		   Dumpling Dough:
      2 c  Flour
      1    To 1 1/4 cup very hot water
      1 ts Salt
           Dumpling Filling:
           Same as for spring roll in
           Above recipe
      3 tb Peanut oil, for the wok
      1 c  Very hot water, for the wok
    1/4 c  Chopped green onions
 
  For dough: Place the flour in a large mixing bowl. Add the hot water
  in a steady stream, mixing with a fork until most of the water has
  been incorporated. If the mixture is dry add a little more water. The
  dough should be moist but not sticky. Remove the dough from the bowl
  and knead it on a floured board until it is smooth. Return the dough
  to the bowl and let it rest, about 5 minutes. Knead the dough on a
  floured board, dusting with a little flour to prevent from sticking.
  Form the dough into a roll about 18 inches long and about 1 inch in
  diameter. Using a sharp knife cut the roll into 4 equal lengths. Cut
  each length into 8 pieces to make 36 equal segments. Press each
  segment with the palm of your hand and roll it into a 3 1/2 inch
  round. Cover the finished rounds with a damp cloth. Pinch one side of
  the dough until you have four pleats along the side, and the dough is
  rounded and shell-like. Place 2 teaspoons of the filling in the
  center of each round, filling the hollow. Fold the dough over the
  filling and pinch the two sides together until you have a half-moon
  dumpling.
  
  To fry: heat the wok and add the peanut oil when the pan is hot. Add
  the dumplings, pleated edge up, in a single layer, crowding them in
  wok. Cook until they are lightly brown on the bottoms. Pour in the
  very hot water, cover tightly, and cook vigorously for 2 minutes.
  Turn the heat down to a simmer and continue to cook for another 8-10
  minutes or until most of the water has evaporated. Uncover the pan
  and continue cooking until all of the moisture has evaporated and the
  wok is sizzling again and the dumplings are golden brown and crisp on
  the bottoms.
  
  To boil: Drop them into a large pot of salted, boiling water for 2
  minutes. Remove from the heat and leave them in the water for about
  15 minutes. Garnish with green onions.
  
  Yield: 36 dumplings

  milk mixture into flour along with eggs, beating with a heavy-duty
  electric mixer on low for 30 seconds, just to combine. Increase speed
  to high and beat 3 minutes. Add enough of remaining flour, a little
  at a time, stirring with a spoon to make a firm but pliable dough.
  Knead dough on lightly-floured work surface 4 to 5 minutes and
  transfer to an oiled bowl. Cover and let dough rise until it doubles
  in size, about 1 hour. Turn dough out onto floured surface, punch
  down and roll out to 1 /2- inch thickness. Cut out doughnuts with a
  floured doughnut cutter; reroll trimmings and cut them into doughnuts
  as well. Transfer doughnuts to baking sheets, cover and let rise
       45    minutes.
  
  Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 360 degrees. Fry doughnuts, in batches,
  turning several times, until golden all over. Using a slotted spoon
  remove doughnuts to a rack to drain. If using Honey Glaze,
  immediately glaze hot doughnuts; if using Chocolate Glaze, let cool
  first. Or let doughnuts cool and dredge in confectioners' sugar or

      Title: Whole Wheat Soda Bread
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
  1 3/4 c  Whole wheat flour
    1/3 c  Raw wheat germ
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Baking soda
      2 tb Butter, softened
      1    Egg
  1 1/2 c  Buttermilk
 
  Heat oven to 450 degrees F.
  
  Whisk together dry ingredients in a large bowl. Using your
  fingertips, work the softened butter into the flour mixture. (Rub the
  flour/butter mixture between your thump and forefingers.) In a
  separate small bowl, whisk the egg and then whisk in the buttermilk.
  Make a well in the flour, and add most of the buttermilk mixture
  (reserve 1/4-cup) and whisk together with your fingers to form a
  loose dough. (Stiffen your fingers and rotate your hand like a
  beater.) If dough will not come together, add some or all of the
  remaining buttermilk mixture in 1 tablespoon increments.
  
  On a well floured work surface, turn out the dough. Sprinkle with
  flour and shape into a circle. Knead 3 or 4 times gently then flatten
  slightly with the tips of your fingers so that the dough is 7 inches
  in diameter and 1-1/4 inches high. Cut a cross on the top all the way
  to the sides, transfer to a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes.
  Reduce heat to 400 degrees for another 20 minutes. Check bread. When
  it is done it will sound hollow when thumped on the bottom, be well
  browned, and an instant read thermometer will read about 185 degrees
  when inserted halfway into the bottom. Let sit 1/2-hour before
  slicing.

 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    (3 to 4 pound) chicken, cut
           In 10 pieces (cut each
           Breast half in half
           Again)
           Salt and freshly ground
           Pepper to taste
      2 tb Olive oil
      3 tb Butter
      3 c  Chicken stock
    1/2    -cup onion, finely chopped
      2 c  Mushrooms (about 6 ounces),
           Chopped
      3 tb Flour
      1 c  Half and half
    1/4    -cup flat leaf parsley,
           Minced
           Freshly grated nutmeg
 
  Heat oven to 200 degrees F.
  
  Rinse chicken pieces, pat dry with paper towels. Season with salt and
  freshly ground black pepper. Heat olive oil and only 1 tablespoon
  butter in a large, deep skillet, cast iron preferred. When foam
  subsides, add chicken pieces in two batches, starting skin side down
  and brown both sides over medium high heat, a total of 10 to 12
  minutes. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat. Return all chicken to
  the skillet add stock, bring to a simmer, and cook gently for 25 to
  30 minutes until chicken has cooked through. Be sure that the thigh
  meat is thoroughly cooked. Remove chicken to a bowl and place in
  oven. Strain cooking liquid through 4 layers of cheesecloth. (You can
  skip the straining for a less "refined" dish.) Return sauce to
  skillet.
  
  While the chicken is cooking, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a
  separate skillet. When hot, add the onions and mushrooms and saute
  over medium high heat, stirring frequently, until mushrooms release
  their liquid, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the flour and cook for 1 minute,
  stirring constantly. Stir in the cream and season liberally with
  salt, pepper and freshly grated nutmeg. Whisk this mixture into the
  broth in the skillet over medium heat. Bring to a boil and cook for 5
  to 6 minutes or until sauce thickens slightly (it should be the
  consistency of half and half). Arrange chicken on serving plates and
  cover with sauce. (This recipe makes 3-1/2 cups of sauce. You will
  have leftovers.) Garnish with an abundance of parsley.

      Title: All Season Apple Pie
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           For the pie crust:
  2 1/2 c  Flour
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Sugar
     12 tb Chilled butter cut into 1/4
           To 3/8 inch cubes
    1/2    -cup chilled all-vegetable
           Shortening
      7    To 8 tablespoon ice water
           For the Filling:
      4    Granny Smith and 4 Macintosh
           Apples
    3/4    -cup granulated sugar
  1 1/2 tb Lemon juice
      1 ts Grated lemon zest
    1/4    -teaspoon freshly grated
           Nutmeg
    1/4    -teaspoon cinnamon
    1/8    -teaspoon allspice
    1/4    -teaspoon salt
      1    Egg white, lightly beaten
      1 tb Sugar for topping
 
  Pulse flour, salt and sugar in food processor fitted with steel blade.
  Scatter butter pieces over flour mixture, tossing to coat butter with
  a little of the flour. Pulse machine 5 times in 1 second bursts. Add
  shortening and continue pulsing until flour is pale yellow and
  resembles coarse cornmeal, with butter bits no larger than small
  peas, 4 to 6 more 1 second pulses. Turn mixture into medium bowl. If
  you don't have a food processor, grate frozen butter and shortening
  into flour mixture and mix with your hands for 1 minute, rubbing
  flour and shortening between your fingers. Flour should turn very
  pale yellow and become coarser in texture.
  
  Sprinkle 6 tablespoons of ice water over mixture. With blade of rubber
  spatula, use folding motion to mix. Press down on dough with broad
  side of spatula until dough sticks together. Shape into ball with
  hands, divide the dough into two balls one sightly larger than the
  other. Dust lightly with flour, wrap separately in plastic and
  refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
  
  Remove dough from refrigerator. The dough is ready to be rolled when
  it is still cool to the touch but you can push your finger halfway
  down through the center. If the dough has been chilled for more than
  1 hour, it may have to sit on the counter for 10 to 20 minutes to
  soften.
  
  Heat oven to 425 degrees.
  
  Roll larger dough disk on lightly floured surface into a 12-inch
  circle, about 1/8-inch thick, the depth of a quarter. Transfer and
  fit dough into 9-inch Pyrex pan, leaving dough that overhangs the lip
  in place. Refrigerate dough while preparing the fruit.
  
  Peel apples, quarter, and remove core. Slice each quarter into thirds,
  about 1/2-inch thick. Toss with lemon juice, lemon zest, salt, sugar,
  spices.
  
  Turn fruit mixture, including any juices, into pie shell. Roll out the
  remaining ball of dough and place it over the top of the pie. Trim
  top and bottom edges to 1/2-inch beyond pan lip. Tuck this rim of
  dough underneath itself so that folded edge is flush with pan lip.
  Flute dough in your own fashion, or press with fork tines to seal.
  Cut four slits at right angles on dough top to allow steam to escape.
  Brush egg white on top of crust and sprinkle 1 tablespoon of sugar
  evenly over the top.
  
  Place pie on bottom rack. Bake until crust is lightly golden, 25
  minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees and continue to bake
  until juices bubble and crust is deep golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes.
  The bottom crust should be golden and the juices from pie bubbling.
  
  Transfer pie to wire rack: let cool to almost room temperature about 4
  hours. Pie is best eaten after it has completely cooled, even the
  next day.
  
  Variations:
  
  CRYSTALLIZED GINGER APPLE PIE
  
  Add 3 tablespoons of chopped ginger to apple mixture.
  
  DRIED RAISIN, CHERRY OR CRANBERRY APPLE PIE
  
  Macerate 1 cup dried fruit (chopped coarse if large) in the lemon
  juice and 1 tablespoon liqueur Apple Jack, brandy or cognac. Toss
  with apple mixture.
  
  FRESH CRANBERRY PIE
  
  Add 1 cup fresh or frozen cranberries to apples, and increase sugar
  to 1 cup from 3/4 cup.

      Title: Easy Brioche Loaf
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 c  Milk
      1    Envelope (2 teaspoons)
           Active dry yeast
  2 1/4 c  Unbleached, all-purpose
           Flour, divided
      6 tb Unsalted butter
      3 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 lg Eggs
 
  Butter a loaf pan and cut a piece of parchment or waxed paper to fit
  the inside bottom of the pan. Butter the paper. About 40 to 45
  minutes after placing the dough in the pan to rise, preheat the oven
  to 350 degrees, setting a rack in the middle level.
  
  In a small saucepan over low heat, warm the milk until it is just
  warm, about 110 degrees. Remove from heat and pour into a small bowl.
  Whisk in the yeast, then stir 1 cup of the flour into the yeast and
  milk mixture. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside at room
  temperature while preparing the other ingredients. It may begin to
  rise slightly before you add it to the other ingredients.
  
  Cut the butter into 6 or 8 pieces and combine with sugar and salt in
  the work bowl of a food processor, fitted with the metal blade. Pulse
  at one-second intervals until the mixture is soft and smooth,
  scraping the inside of the bowl several times to ensure even mixing.
  Add the eggs, one at a time, and process until smooth. If the mixture
  appears curdled, continue to process for about 1 minute longer, until
  it looks smoother. (It may remain somewhat curdled in appearance.)
  Add the remaining 1 1/4 cups flour, then the milk-yeast-flour
  mixture, scraping it from the bowl with a rubber spatula. Pulse at
  one-second intervals until the ingredients form a soft, smooth dough.
  Then process continuously for fifteen seconds.
  
  Remove work bowl from base and remove blade. Scrape dough onto a
  generously floured work surface and fold it over on itself several
  times to make it more elastic. Press the dough into a rough
  rectangle, about 9 x 5-inches. Fold each side about 1-inch in toward
  the center and press firmly to seal. Then starting at the top of the
  rectangle, fold the dough to the middle. Fold the bottom of the dough
  up past the seam and pinch to seal. Place the dough in the prepared
  pan, seam side down. Press the top of the dough firmly with the palm
  of your hand to flatten it and fill the pan evenly. Cover with a
  piece of buttered plastic wrap or a towel and allow to rise until it
  is about one inch above the rim of the pan. Using the corner of a
  razor blade or the tip of a sharp knife held at a 30 degree angle to
  the top of the loaf, cut a slash down the middle of the top beginning
  and ending about one inch from the ends of the loaf. Bake the loaf
  for about 40 minutes, until it is well risen and a deep golden color.
  Place the pan on a rack to cool 5 minutes. Then invert the loaf to
  the rack and turn it on its side to cool.

      Title: Cinnamon Pecan Coffee Ring With Orange Icing
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Batch Quick brioche dough
           Cinnamon Pecan Filling:
      2 c  Pecan pieces
    3/4 c  Sugar
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
           White of 1 large egg
      1 ts Grated lemon zest
    3/4 c  Strained apricot preserves
    1/2 c  Raisins or currants
           Confectioners' Sugar Icing:
      2 c  Confectioners sugar
    1/4 c  Orange juice
 
  Line a cookie sheet or jelly roll pan with parchment or foil.
  
  Roll dough into an 8 by18-inch rectangle. Fold the dough in half the
  long way, slide the 4 by18-inch dough onto a cookie sheet, cover with
  plastic wrap and refrigerate. To make the filling, place the pecan
  pieces in the work bowl of a food processor. Process until they are
  reduced to a paste. Add the sugar and pulse several times to mix. Add
  all the filling ingredients except the preserves. Remove the
  rectangle of dough from the refrigerator and unfold it on the work
  surface. Spread the dough evenly with the filling, using a small
  offset metal spatula. Stir the preserves to soften them, then spread
  evenly over the filling with a spatula. Sprinkle with the raisins.
  
  Begin at one of the long ends and roll the filling up in the dough to
  form a roll about 18-inches long. If the dough has softened during
  the spreading and rolling, cut the roll in half, slide both pieces
  onto a pan and refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes. Mark the top
  of the roll at 1 1/2-inch intervals, then cut through with a sharp,
  thin knife, making 12 slashes in the roll. Arrange the slashed piece
  of dough on the pan and connect the ends. Fan out the cut portions.
  Cover pan with buttered plastic wrap and allow dough to rise until
  the spaces between the rolls are filled in, up to one hour. About 40
  minutes after putting the cake to rise, set a rack at the middle
  level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.
  
  Bake about 45 minutes, until the dough is firm and baked through and
  a deep golden color. Place the pan on a rack until cool enough to
  handle, then slide to a cooling rack. When cool, invert to a platter
  and drizzle the cake with the icing.
  
  To make icing:
  
  Combine confectioners' sugar and orange juice and place over low
  heat. Stir until luke-warm, then drizzle over cooled cake.

    1/2 ts Salt
      3 tb Yellow cornmeal
      1 tb Flour
      2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      2    Whole boneless chicken
           Breasts (about 2 pounds),
           Cut into 2-inch pieces
      1 tb Butter
      3 tb Flour
      1 sm Onion, chopped fine
      1 sm Green bell pepper, chopped
           Fine
      1    Rib of celery, chopped fine
  1 1/4 c  Chicken broth
      4    Fresh or canned plum
           Tomatoes, chopped
      1 ts Chili powder
      1 c  Fresh corn kernels including
           Pulp scraped from cobs
    1/2 c  Thinly sliced scallion
           Greens
    1/4 c  Loosely packed fresh basil
           Leaves, chopped
 
  Make the corn wafers:
  
  In a bowl with an electric mixer cream the butter, add sugar, and
  beat the mixture until it is light and fluffy. Add the egg white and
  salt and beat the mixture at low speed for 5 seconds, or until it is
  just combined. The mixture will be lumpy. Add the cornmeal, flour and
  Parmesan and stir the mixture until it is just combined. Transfer the
  mixture to a small bowl and chill it, covered, for at least 4 hours
  or overnight. Arrange rounded teaspoons of the mixture 3 inches apart
  on buttered baking sheets and with a fork dipped in cold water
  flatten them carefully to form 2-inch rounds. Bake the wafers in
  batches in the middle of a preheated 425 degree oven for 5 to 6
  minutes, or until the edges are golden brown, with a spatula transfer
  the wafers immediately to racks, and let them cool.
  
  In a 9-inch cast iron skillet heat the oil over moderately high heat
  until it is hot but not smoking and in it brown the chicken, patted
  dry and seasoned with salt and pepper, in batches, transferring it as
  it is browned to a bowl. To the fat remaining in the skillet add the
  butter and flour and cook the roux over moderately low heat, stirring
  constantly, until it is the color of peanut butter. Stir in the
  onion, bell pepper, and celery and cook the mixture, stirring
  occasionally, until the vegetables are softened. Add the broth,
  tomatoes, chili powder, and chicken with any juices that have
  accumulated in the bowl, simmer the stew, covered, for 6 to 8
  minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through, and stir in the
  corn. The stew may be prepared up to this point 1 day in advance and
  kept covered and chilled. Before serving, stir in the scallion greens
  and basil, season with salt and pepper, and serve it in bowls topped
  with the corn wafers.

           Off and reserved for another
           Use such
           As wing tip consomme and the

      1 tb Cider vinegar
           Blue Cheese Dressing (recipe
           Follows) and celery sticks
           As accompaniments
 
  In a deep fryer or deep heavy skillet heat 2 inches of the shortening
  to 380 degrees and in it fry the wings, patted dry and seasoned with
  salt and pepper, in small batches for 5 to 8 minutes, or until they
  are golden and crisp, transferring them with a slotted spoon as they
  are fried to paper towels to drain and making sure the shortening
  returns to 380 degrees before adding each new
  
  batch. In a large skillet melt the butter with the Louisiana Hot
  Sauce and the vinegar over low heat, stirring, add the wings, and
  heat them, tossing them to coat them with the mixture. Transfer the
  wings to a platter and serve them warm or at room temperature with
  the blue cheese dressing and the celery sticks.

      Title: Basic Olive Oil Breadsticks
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Warm water, about 100
           Degrees
  2 1/2 ts Active dry yeast
      3 c  Unbleached flour
      2 ts Salt
      5 tb Extra virgin olive oil
           Cornmeal for pans
 
  Place the water in a small bowl and whisk in yeast. Allow yeast to
  soften while preparing remaining ingredients.
  
  Place flour and salt in work bowl of food processor fitted with metal
  blade. Pulse 2 or 3 times to mix. Add oil and pulse ten times to mix
  thoroughly. Add yeast mixture, being careful to scrape all yeast from
  bowl with a rubber spatula. Pulse again until the dough forms a ball,
  about ten more times. Let the dough rest in the work bowl for 5
  minutes, then run the machine continuously for 10 seconds, for a
  final mixing of the dough.
  
  Remove dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead lightly to
  form a smooth ball. Place the dough in an oiled bowl and turn dough
  to coat all surfaces. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let
  dough rise at room temperature until double in bulk, about an hour.
  
  After dough has risen, remove from bowl to lightly floured work
  surface and knead lightly to deflate. Form dough into a ball and
  place in oiled bowl, turning dough to coat all surfaces. Cover
  tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate dough for 2 hours (or up to
  24 hours) before proceeding.
  
  Preheat oven to 325 degrees and set racks in upper and lower thirds.
  Cover three jelly roll pans with cornmeal, using a tablespoon or so
  for each pan.
  
  Scrape refrigerated dough from bowl to a lightly floured work surface,
  making sure dough emerges from bowl in one piece and doesn't fold.
  Press dough into a 9-inch square. Cut dough into 2 rectangles, each 4
  1/2 by 9-inches. Then cut each rectangle into 1/2 by 4 1/2-inch
  lengths, to make 36 pieces in all. Cover the cut pieces of dough with
  plastic wrap or a towel to keep them from forming a skin. One at a
  time, roll pieces of dough under palms of hands, stretching at the
  same time, to make narrow sticks about 15-inches long. If dough
  resists, set pieces aside under plastic wrap or towel to rest for 5
  minutes, and they will roll and stretch easily.
  
  As breadsticks are formed, arrange them in length of pan, about 10 or
  12 to a pan, keeping them about 1/2-inch apart. Let the breadsticks
  rest about 10 minutes, then bake the first two pans for about 20 to
  30 minutes, until they are firm, crisp and light golden. The third
  pan may wait while the first ones are baking. Cool the breadsticks on
  the pans or on racks. Store breadsticks in a paper bag or loosely
  covered with plastic wrap at room temperature. If they absorb
  humidity and soften, bake them again for 5 minutes at 325 degrees.

      Title: Brioche Bee Sting Cake (Nid D'abeilles - Bienenstich)
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Batch Quick brioche dough
           Almond Brittle Topping:
      6 tb (3/4 stick) unsalted butter
    1/4 c  Honey
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 c  Sliced, blanched almonds
           Pastry Cream Filling:
      1 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Sugar
      2 tb Cornstarch
      4 lg Egg yolks
      2 ts Vanilla extract
      1 tb Kirsch, optional
      1    Stick soft unsalted butter
 
  Butter a 2 by 10-inch pan and line the bottom with a piece of
  parchment or buttered waxed paper.
  
  To form the dough, fold it over on itself several times on a lightly
  floured surface and form it into a sphere, rounding it so that the
  outside skin of the dough is smooth and seamless. Cover the rounded
  piece of dough with a towel and allow to rest for 5 minutes. Then
  press dough evenly into the prepared pan and pierce it at 1-inch
  intervals with a fork. Cover the pan with a towel and allow the dough
  to rise until it is half again larger in bulk, about 30 minutes.
  Uncover the dough and refrigerate it for 20 minutes. Immediately
  after you refrigerate the dough, set a rack at the middle level of
  the oven and preheat to 350 degrees. To make the topping, combine all
  ingredients except the almonds in a small saucepan. Place the pan
  over low heat and bring the mixture to a boil stirring constantly.
  Stir in the almonds, then remove the pan from the heat, and pour the
  topping into a buttered, heat proof bowl and cool it to room
  temperature.
  
  After the dough has chilled for 20 minutes, remove it from the
  refrigerator and, using the back of a spoon or a small offset metal
  spatula, spread the almond topping evenly. Bake for about 30 minutes,
  until the topping is well caramelized and the dough is firm and baked
  through. Remove the pan to a rack to cool for ten minutes, then
  loosen the topping from the sides of the pan by inserting the point
  of a small sharp knife 1/2-inch down between the topping and the side
  of the pan. Unmold the cake, remove the paper and cool it on a rack.
  
  While the cake is baking prepare the filling: Combine 3/4 cup of the
  milk and the sugar in a non-reactive saucepan over low heat. Whisk
  once to mix in the sugar and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, whisk the
  remaining milk and cornstarch thoroughly in a small mixing bowl and
  whisk in the yolks. Whisk in the boiled milk in a stream and return
  the mixture to the pan. Replace pan over low heat and whisk
  constantly as the cream thickens and comes to a boil, about 2
  minutes. Allow to boil, whisking 30 seconds. Remove from heat; whisk
  in vanilla. Divide the butter into 8 pieces and whisk into the cream
  one piece at a time. Pour the cream into a bowl, scrape sides of the
  bowl clean with a rubber spatula and press plastic wrap against the
  surface of the cream to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate
  cream until cold. Remove the cream from the refrigerator and whisk by
  hand until smooth, about 10 seconds.
  
  To fill the cake, slice it in half horizontally using a sharp serrated
  knife. Place the bottom layer on a platter and, using a small offset
  metal spatula, spread evenly with the filling. Cut the top of the
  cake into 10 or 12 wedges and rearrange them on top of the cake,
  fitting them closely together. (Pre-cutting the top eliminates
  pressure when the cake is cut and prevents the filling from oozing
  out).

      Title: Deep-Fried Onion Rings
 Categories: Taste
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 c  Buttermilk
  1 1/2 ts Baking soda
           Salt and pepper
      6    Medium-large sweet onions,
           About 1/2 each (such as
           Vidalia, Walla Walla,
           Maui, Texas Sweet)
           Oil, for deep-frying
      4 c  Flour
 
  In a large bowl combine buttermilk and baking soda; season well with
  salt and pepper. Peel onions and slice thinly, no thicker than
  1/4-inch; a mandoline works well. Add to buttermilk mixture and stir
  well to submerge all onions. Set aside, unrefrigerated, for 2 hours.
  
  In a deep-fryer or heavy, deep pot, heat at least 1 quart oil to 375
  degrees F. Working in batches, place about 1/6 of flour in a large
  bowl. With your hands, remove about 1/6 of onions from buttermilk.
  Don't let the liquid run off. Add to flour and mix vigorously with
  your hands until onions are well-coated. Separate them by hand and
  lay them in a deep-fry basket. Lower into hot oil, maintaining
  temperature. Stir every 2 minutes. When onions are golden brown and
  crisp, about 6 minutes, drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt.
  Keep warm in a 200 degree F oven while you finish the rest.

      2 c  Shucked fresh clams
      2 c  Fresh clam juice, from clams
           Or bottled clam juice
      4 tb Butter
      3    Leeks, white parts only,
           Thinly sliced into rounds
      2    Celery ribs, minced
    1/2    Green bell pepper, minced

           For garnish
 
  If using fresh clams, shuck them over a bowl to catch their juices.
  Measure 2 cups of juices, transfer to a small saucepan and heat just

      Title: Potstickers
 Categories: Taste
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 lb Napa cabbage
      2 ts Kosher salt
    3/4 lb Coarsely-ground pork
      1 tb Finely-minced fresh ginger
      1 tb Minced garlic
    1/3 c  Coarsely-chopped scallions
      1 tb Soy sauce
      1 tb Chinese rice wine
      1 tb Toasted sesame oil
    1/4 ts Freshly-ground pepper
     24    Round wonton wrappers
           Up to 1/4 cup oil, for
           Pan-frying
           Up to 2 cups stock
           Sauce:
    1/3 c  Soy sauce
      3 tb White vinegar
      1 tb Toasted sesame oil
      1 ts Chinese chili sauce
    1/3 ts Sugar
      2 tb Thinly-sliced scallions
 
  Make filling: Chop cabbage to small pieces, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon
  of salt and toss well. Let stand 10 minutes, drain, then squeeze
  firmly to wring out excess moisture. In a large mixing bowl scatter
  cabbage and add pork. Sprinkle remaining filling ingredients on top.
  Using chopsticks, stir briskly in one direction until well-blended.
  Throw mixture against inside of bowl 5 to 6 times to compact it.
  Press plastic wrap on surface of filling and set aside 30 minutes at
  room temperature, or refrigerate up to 24 hours for flavor to
  develop. Bring to room temperature before using .
  
  Fill one wrapper at a time, keeping remaining covered. Heap 1 level
  tablespoon filling off-center in wrapper and shape into a half-moon,
  about 2 inches. Run a moist finger lightly around edge of wrapper.
  Pleat and press dumpling closed. Transfer dumplings as they are made
  to a lightly-floured baking sheet and keep them covered with a towel
  to prevent drying.
  
  Make sauce: About 20 minutes before serving, mix dipping sauce
  ingredients and season to taste.
  
  Heat a heavy 12-inch cast-iron skillet with a tight-fitting cover
  over high heat. When very hot, add enough oil to coat bottom with a
  scant 1/4-inch, swirl skillet to coat bottom and sides, and reduce
  heat to medium. When oil is hot, pick up dumplings by their tops and
  quickly arrange them, smooth side down, in concentric rings starting
  from outside of pan and working into center. You will be able to cook
  about half of dumplings at a time. Dumplings should hug each other
  tightly in a pretty spiral; they will stick together. Adjust heat so
  they sizzle mildly. When all dumplings are in place, raise heat to
  brown bottoms. Check frequently, and when bottoms are browned, add
  enough stock to come halfway up sides of dumplings. Adjust heat to
  simmering and cover. After about 7 minutes, check to see if almost
  all stock has been absorbed. Check bottoms of dumplings -- they
  should be crisp enough to "clink" against a fingernail. If needed,
  add a little more oil down side of pan, swirl to distribute under
  dumplings and continue frying until crisp.
  
  Loosen dumplings from bottom with a spatula and invert them onto a
  warmed serving platter, browned bottoms up -- they should cling in a
  spiral. Spoon dumpling sauce into individual saucers or dipping bowls
  and serve immediately. Do this in two pans at once, or repeat to cook
  remaining potstickers.

           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      3    Truffles or 2 ounces dried
           Cepes (porcinis)
           Cloves of garlic, thinly

    3/4 pt Hot meat stock or water
    1/4 pt White wine
 
  Ask your butcher to bone the loin and remove the rind, but keep both
  bones and the rind for the cooking.  If you are using dried cepes,
  cover them with warm water and leave to soak for 30 minutes or until
  they are soft. Drain, reserving the liquid.  Lay the meat on a board
  and season well with salt and pepper.  Cut the truffles or cepes into
  little pieces and lay at intervals along the meat interspersed with
  slivers of garlic. Roll the meat up and tie it with string into a
  long bolster shape. Place it in a roasting pan surrounded by the
  bones and the rind cut into strips. Roast in a preheated oven at 325
  degrees for 30 minutes.  Pour in the hot stock or water, the wine,
  and the liquid from the cepes.  Cover and cook for a further 2 to 2
  1/2 hours.  Remove the pork and keep hot. Strain the juices and
  reduce, then season to taste.  Serve with the sliced pork. Or, if
  serving the pork cold, pour off the juices into a bowl and chill.
  Remove the fat, but keep it for frying bread or little potatoes--it
  has a splendid flavor.  The juices will have jellied and should be
  chopped and arranged around the cold pork in a serving dish. Serve
  with what you will, such as a fine salad and some sauteed potatoes.

 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Soy oil
    1/2 c  Chopped onion, small dice
    3/4 c  Chopped peppers (red, green
           And yellow), small dice
      3    Egg yolks
    1/4 c  Fresh lime juice
    1/4 c  Dijon mustard
    1/2 tb Tabasco
      1 tb Vietnamese fish sauce
      1 lb Jumbo lump crabmeat,
           Uncleaned
  1 1/2 tb Each of fresh dill, chives
           And parsley, cleaned, stems
           Removed and roughly chopped
  1 1/2 c  Fresh bread crumbs (crusts
           Removed)
      1 c  Japanese bread crumbs,
           (Panko)
      1 tb Freshly ground white pepper
      2    Eggs
           Vegetable oil for sauteing
 
  Method:
  
  Pre-heat the oven to 350 degrees.
  
  In a sauce pan over medium heat, place the oil, onions and peppers,
  and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 7 minutes.
  
  Combine the 3 egg yolks, lime juice, mustard, Tabasco, fish sauce in a
  large bowl. Remove the oil and vegetables from the heat. Slowly pour
  into the yolk mixture, whisking constantly. Begin by pouring with
  small splashes, incorporating the oil completely before adding more.
  The heat of the oil will cook the yolks as you go, and you should end
  up with a hollandaise-like sauce when all the oil has been blended.
  Return the saucepan to the heat for 30 seconds, whisking constantly
  to insure that sauce is fully incorporated.
  
  Set the saucepan down over a bowl of ice and whisk to cook quickly.
  Refrigerate the sauce covered, until it is well-chilled.
  
  Make the crab cakes:
  
  Pick over crab meat to remove any shell pieces. Add the herbs and
  gently toss, taking care not to break up the crab. Add two or three
  heaping tablespoons of the chilled sauce base to the crab and gently
  combine. Add enough of the bread crumbs to bind the crab mixture.
  Check to see that the mixture is moist (the bread crumbs will absorb
  moisture as the crab mix sits) and add more sauce or bread crumbs as
  needed. Add the white pepper and taste for seasoning. Form the crab
  into little cakes, about 2 inches in diameter. In a separate bowl,
  beat the eggs. One at a time, coat each crab cake with egg. Then coat
  with Japanese bread crumbs. Heat 1/4 of vegetable oil in a large
  saute pan over medium heat. SautJing in batches, brown the crab cakes
  on both sides and reserve on a platter. Place in a pre-heated 350
  degree oven for 2-3 minutes to heat through, and serve.

 Categories: Emeril
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      6    (6 to 8-ounce) Gulf speckled
           Trout fillets, skinned
           Essence
      1 c  Milk
      2 c  Flour
      2 tb Butter
    1/3 c  Olive oil
    3/4 c  Worcestershire Sauce
      2    Whole lemons, skin and pith
           Removed
      2    Bay leaves
    3/4 lb Cold butter, cubed
      1 c  Sliced almonds
      1 tb Chopped parsley
      2 tb Chopped green onions
 
  Season the fillets with Essence. Place the fillets in a glass bowl and
  cover with the milk. Cover the bowl and place in the refrigerator.
  Refrigerate for 1 hour. Remove the bowl from the refrigerator and
  drain. Season the flour with Essence. Dredge the fillets in the
  seasoned flour, coating the fillets completely. In a large saute pan,
  heat 2 tablespoons of the butter and the olive oil together. When the
  oil is hot, pan-fry the fillets for 3 to 4 minutes on each side or
  until the fillets are golden. Remove the fillets from the pan and
  drain on a paper-lined plate. Season the fillets with Essence. Set
  the fish aside. Pour the oil from the skillet, leaving the browned
  bits in the pan. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce, lemons and bay
  leaves. Bring the liquid up to a simmer and simmer the liquid until
  it reduces by 2/3, about 4 minutes. Remove the lemon pith. Whisk the
  cold butter cubes into the sauce, a cube at a time, until all the
  butter is incorporated. The sauce should be thick and coat the back
  of a spoon. Stir in the almond slices. To serve, one fillet in the
  center of each plate. Spoon the sauce over the fish and garnish with
  parsley and green onions.

    1/2 c  Melted butter
      3 lb Cream cheese, softened
      1 c  Sugar
      6    Eggs
      1 c  Coco Lopez milk
    1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Vanilla
  1 1/2 c  Fresh shredded coconut

  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
  
  Combine the cookie crumbs and the butter. Mix well and press into a
  10-inch springform pan. In a food processor, with the metal blade,
  mix the cream cheese until smooth. Add the sugar and blend. Add the
  eggs one at a time to thoroughly incorporate into the cheese mixture.
  Add the coconut milk. Add the flour, salt and vanilla and blend until
  smooth. Add the coconut and pulse until incorporated. Pour into the
  prepared pan. Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until the cake is

      Title: Monkfish Tails Piperade
 Categories: Emeril
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lg Green bell peppers
      2 lg Red bell peppers
      1 lg Yellow onion
      2 tb Or so olive oil
      2    Or 3 cloves garlic, pureed
      1 ts Mixed herbs
           Salt and freshly ground
           Pepper
  3 1/2 lb Trimmed monkfish fillets
           Flour
      2 tb Olive oil
           About 1 cup each dry white
           Wine or French Vermouth, and
           Fish or chicken
           Broth
           Fresh tomato fondue (see
           Recipe)
 
  Wash, halve, stem and seed the peppers, and cut into very fine long
  thin slices. Peel the onion, halve through the root, and cut into thin
  lengthwise slices. Film a large frying pan with the oil, add heat for
  4 to 5 minutes while you add the garlic, herbs and seasonings.
  Vegetables should be partially cooked; they will finish with the
  fish. May be done in advance to this point; let cool uncovered, then
  transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate. Cut the fish into serving
  chunks. Just before you are to saute it, season all sides with a
  sprinkling of salt and pepper, dredge lightly in flour, and shake off
  excess. Into a second frying pan (or in the same one, if you have
  done the vegetables ahead), pour in enough oil to film it and set
  over moderately high heat. When very hot but not smoking, add the
  fish in one layer. Saute for 2 minutes, then turn and saute for 2
  minutes on the other side-not to brown, merely to stiffen slightly.
  Spread the cooked vegetables over the fish. Pour in the wine and
  broth-enough to come halfway up the fish. Cover and simmer about 10
  minutes. Fish is done when it has turned from springy to gently
  soft-it needs a little more cooking than other fish, but must not
  overcook and fall apart. Arrange fish and vegetables on a hot platter
  and cover. Rapidly boil down the juices in frying pan until almost
  syrupy, then spoon them over the fish, and serve, surrounded by the
  optional tomato fondue.

      1 lb Sweetbreads
      2 c  Milk
      2    Lemons, halved
           Salt and pepper
 
  Soak sweetbreads in a shallow dish covered with milk. Set aside in a
  cool place or refrigerate for at least 4 hours to whiten. Discard
  milk, place sweetbreads in a saucepan, squeeze lemons over and drop
  in lemon shells as well. Add 1 tablespoon of salt, a pinch of pepper
  and cover with water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 10
  minutes. Sweetbreads should be about medium when they are done
  poaching. Using a slotted spoon transfer sweetbreads to an ice water
  bath to cool quickly. Drain and pat dry.
  
  To press sweetbreads, place on a large plate, top with another plate,
  and weight with several cans. Set aside, refrigerated, at least 4
  hours. Sweetbreads should be pressed to 3/4-inch thickness to give
  them a nice, firm texture; if you don't press them enough they will
  be spongy.
  
  To clean pieces, remove any excess membranes and veins from pressed
  lobes; leave pieces as intact as possible. If lobes are large, slice
  them in half horizontally. Sweetbreads are ready to use in any recipe.

      Title: Sweet Pie Crust
 Categories: Emeril
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  Flour
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Solid vegetable shortening
    1/2 c  Ice water
 
  For the crust: In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt and sugar.
  Add the shortening and work it through with your hands until the
  mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the water, 1 tablespoon at a
  time, and work it in with your hands until you have a smooth ball of
  dough. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30
  minutes. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a
  lightly floured surface. This recipe will make two pie crusts.
  
  For the individual crust: Divide the dough into fourths. Roll out the
  dough on the floured surface into a circle about 5 inches in diameter
  and 1/8 thick.
  
  For the whole pie crust: Roll out the dough on the floured surface
  into a circle about 14 inches in diameter and 1/8 inch thick. Gently
  fold the circles of dough in half and then in half again so that you
  can lift it without tearing it, and unfold into a 9-inch pie pan.
  
  Yields: 2 pie crusts

      Title: Individual Persimmon Pie With Vanilla Bean Ice Cream
 Categories: Emeril
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Individual pie crust rounds
      1 tb Butter
      2 lb Persimmon, medium dice
      1 c  Granulated sugar
    1/4 c  Grand Marnier
           Juice of one lemon
      2 tb Cornstarch
    1/2 c  Cold water
      4    Scoops vanilla bean ice
           Cream
           Shaker of powdered sugar
           Shaker with cinnamon and
           Sugar mixture
    1/2 c  Caramel sauce in a squeeze
           Bottle
 
  Preheat the oven to 425F. Butter four 4 ounce ramekins.
  
  For the filling:  In a sauce pan, over high heat combine the
  persimmons, sugar, Grand Marnier, and lemon juice.  Bring the mixture
  up to a boil. Combine the cornstarch and the cold water together,
  making a slurry. While whisking the fruit constantly, add the slurry.
  Cook the mixture for 5-6 minutes or until the mixture thickens. Cool
  the mixture for about 10 minutes.  Spoon 1/4 of the fruit mixture
  into each of the four ramekins. Gently lay the individual pie crusts
  over each ramekin. Using your hands, form the crust around the lip of
  the ramekin, cutting off any excess pie crust.  Place in the oven and
  bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. To assemble, place the
  ramekin on a plate.  Place a scoop of vanilla ice cream right on top
  of the pie.  Drizzle the caramel over the top. Sprinkle with powdered
  sugar and cinnamon mixture.

      Title: Brandied Peach Custard Pie
 Categories: Emeril
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Whole peaches, peeled and
           Cut into 1/4 inch wedges
      3 tb Butter
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/4 c  Brandy
           Custard
      2 c  Heavy cream
      4    Eggs
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Nutmeg
      1    Unbaked pie crust
           Shaker with powder sugar
           Fresh mint
           Pastry bag of whipped cream
 
  Preheat the oven to 450F.
  
  For the peaches: Over high heat, in a saute pan, heat the butter.
  When the butter is hot add the sugar. Stir until the sugar is
  dissolved. Add the peaches and saute for 5-6 minutes, or until the
  sugar starts to turn dark amber in color. Incorporate the brandy into
  the peach mixture. Carefully ignite the brandy and flambe the
  peaches. Remove from heat and allow to cool, about 10 minutes.
  
  For the custard: In a mixing bowl, whisk all the ingredients together
  until fully incorporated. In an unbaked pie crust, spoon the brandied
  peaches over the pie crust. Place the crust in the oven and pour the
  custard into the shells. This prevents spilling the custard in the
  oven. Bake for 1 hour or until the custard sets. Place foil around
  the crust for the first 30 minutes and then remove. This keeps the
  crust from getting too brown. Allow to cool for about 30 minutes.
  Place a slice of the pie on the plate and garnish with powder sugar,
  whipped cream, and fresh mint.

      Title: Danish Pastry
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    3/4 c  Milk
  1 1/2 oz (2 envelopes) yeast
      4 c  Unbleached, all purpose
           Flour
    1/3 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      4 tb Cold unsalted butter
      3    Eggs
           Butter:
    1/3 c  Unbleached, all purpose
           Flour
  3 1/2    Sticks (14 ounces) cold
           Unsalted butter
 
  Heat milk to luke warm, about 100 degrees. Remove from heat, pour
  into a bowl and whisk in yeast. Set aside while preparing other
  ingredients. Place flour, sugar and salt in bowl of food processor
  fitted with metal blade; pulse to mix. Add the 4 tablespoons butter
  and pulse until butter is absorbed and mixture is powdery in
  appearance. Add eggs and milk mixture and continue to pulse until
  dough forms a ball. If the dough refuses to form a ball, add up to 3
  tablespoons more flour, one tablespoon at a time, pulsing once or
  twice between each addition.
  
  To mix by hand, combine flour salt and sugar in a bowl and stir well
  to mix. Rub in butter by hand, being sure to leave mixture cool and
  powdery. Beat eggs until liquid and add to flour mixture along with
  yeast-milk mixture. Stir vigorously with a rubber spatula to form a
  dough.
  
  Cover bowl with plastic wrap and allow to rest 5 minutes. Scrape
  dough to floured surface and fold dough over on itself 6 or 8 times,
  sprinkling with up to 3 tablespoons more flour if dough is very soft.
  Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 to 8 hours.
  
  After the dough has chilled, prepare butter: Place half the flour on
  work surface and place butter on it. Scatter remaining flour on
  butter and pound the butter with a rolling pin to soften it to a
  malleable consistency. Scrape butter together and form into a
  cylinder. Immediately remove dough from refrigerator and press in
  into a 6 by 12-inch rectangle on a lightly floured surface.
  Distribute dabs of butter in a 6 by 9-inch rectangle at the closer
  end of the dough, covering dough as completely as possible. Fold the
  top (unbuttered) portion of dough down over the middle section and
  the bottom (buttered) portion up to cover it. Position the dough so
  the fold is on the left and roll the dough back to its original size,
  flouring the surface and dough as necessary. Fold both short ends in
  to the middle of the dough and fold again at the middle, making 4
  layers. Reposition the dough so that the fold is on the left again
  and repeat rolling and folding. Double-wrap dough in plastic wrap and
  refrigerate dough several hours or overnight before using.
  
  Yield: about 2 pounds of dough

 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Milk
      1 pk Active dry yeast
      1 c  Unbleached all purpose
           Flour
      1 c  Buckwheat flour
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      3 lg Eggs, separated
      8 tb Unsalted butter, melted
      2 tb Clarified unsalted butter,
           Optional
           Garnish:
      8 tb Unsalted butter, melted
           Sugar
      1 c  Apricot jam, or more as
           Needed, warmed
           About 1 pint sour cream
 
  Heat the milk in a small saucepan until lukewarm; remove from the
  heat. Sprinkle the yeast over the top and let stand until softened, 2
  to 3 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, sift the flours, sugar and salt into a large bowl. In a
  separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks until creamy; stir in the milk
  mixture and the melted butter. Add to the dry ingredients and stir
  just until blended. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm spot
  until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
  
  When the batter has risen, beat the egg whites in a medium bowl until
  soft peaks form. Gently fold into the batter just until blended.
  
  Heat a large nonstick griddle or skillet over medium heat until hot
  enough to sizzle a drop of water. Brush with a thin film of vegetable
  oil or clarified butter, if using. Add the batter by tablespoons for
  small pancakes or use a scant 1/4 cup measure for larger pancakes.
  Adjust the heat to medium low. Cook until the tops are covered with
  small bubbles and the bottoms are lightly browned. Carefully turn and
  lightly brown the other side.
  
  Keep the pancakes warm on a platter covered with foil in an oven set
  at the lowest temperature while you cook the remaining batter. To
  serve, drizzle each serving with some of the melted butter and
  sprinkle with sugar. Top with warm apricot jam and a spoonful of sour
  cream.

 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 c  Unbleached all purpose
           Flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      3 lg Eggs
      1 c  Milk
      2 tb Unsalted butter, melted
      1 tb Brandy (optional)
           Berry sauce:
    1/4 c  Water
      1 tb Cornstarch
     10 oz Frozen strawberries or
           Raspberries, thawed
      2 tb Orange liqueur
           Ricotta filling:
     15 oz Container ricotta cheese
    1/2 c  Confectioner's sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 ts Grated orange zest
        pn Ground nutmeg
    1/4 c  Minced candied orange rind
           Or citron (optional)
 
  Combine flour and salt in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk the
  eggs, milk, butter and brandy, if using, until blended. Add to the
  flour all at once and gently stir with the whisk until blended. Let
  stand for at least 1 hour at room temperature. (The batter can be
  refrigerated, covered, overnight; stir to blend before using.)
  
  Make berry sauce: In a small saucepan combine water and cornstarch
  and stir until the cornstarch is dissolved. Add the strawberries or
  raspberries. Heat, stirring, until the mixture boils and thickens.
  Remove from the heat and stir in orange liqueur, if desired. Set
  aside.
  
  Make ricotta filling: In a bowl, mix together the ricotta, sugar,
  vanilla, zest, nutmeg, and optional candied orange rind. Set aside.
  
  Heat a 6 or 7-inch heavy nonstick skillet or crepe pan over medium
  heat until hot enough to sizzle a drop of water. Brush with a thin
  film of vegetable oil, or spray with nonstick cooking spray. Ladle
  about 3 tablespoons batter (or a scant 1/4 cup measure) into the hot
  pan and quickly tilt to coat the pan and make a thin pancake.
  
  Cook the crepe until the edges begin to curl and the underside is
  golden, about 1 1/2 minutes. Loosen the edges of the crepe with a
  thin flexible spatula or a heatproof rubber spatula and gently turn.
  Cook the underside until lightly spotted with color, about 30
  seconds. Turn the crepe out onto a wire rack.
  
  Repeat with the remaining batter, stirring it occasionally. As the
  crepes are made, transfer them from the rack to a pie plate. Cover
  lightly with a piece of foil and keep warm in an oven set at the
  lowest temperature. Fill with the ricotta mixture and drizzle with
  the berry sauce.
  
  The crepes can be cooled, wrapped in foil and refrigerated for a few
  days before reheating in a warm oven. They can also be frozen for at
  least 1 month. Cool, stack them on top of one another and wrap
  tightly in foil and then in a freezer bag. The crepes need no paper
  between them; they will not stick together when frozen or
  refrigerated. They thaw at room temperature in about 1 hour, and can
  be reheated right in the foil without unwrapping.

  minutes or until the potatoes begin to brown. Add the julienned
  mushrooms to the skillet and cook for 3 to 4 additional minutes.
  
  Season the vegetable mixture with salt and pepper, remove using a
  slotted spoon, and add the cubed beef to the hot oil in one even
  layer. Brown the beef over high heat, turning only when one side has
  browned, and browning all sides evenly and quickly to maintain a
  medium rare interior. The beef should brown in approximately 7 to 8
  minutes. Season the beef with salt and pepper. Add the chili puree,
  tomato dice and cilantro. Add the cooked onion potato mushroom mix
  back to the pan and stir to combine. Press down along the edges so
  that a crust forms along the bottom. Turn the cooked hash out onto a
  plate and garnish with warm blanched sugar snap peas. Serve
  {optional} with poached quail eggs.

    1/2 ts Olive oil
           Filling:
      1 lb Baked potatoes, peeled and
           Mashed
      1 c  Fresh bread crumbs
      1 lb Leftover meat or sausage,
           Chopped or crumbled
    1/2 c  Grated Parmigiano
    1/2    To 1 cup milk
           Salt and pepper
        pn Cinnamon
           Sauce:
      6 tb Butter
      6 tb Veal stock
 
  To make pasta: Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large
  wooden cutting board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add
  the eggs and oil. Using a fork, beat together the eggs and the oil
  and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the
  well.
  
  As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well
  shape. Do not worry that this intial phase looks messy. The dough
  will come together when half of the flour is incorporated.
  
  Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palm of your
  hands. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board
  and scape up any leftover crusty bits. Lightly flour the board and
  continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough should be elastic and
  a little sticky. Continue to knead for another 3 minutes remembering
  to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the dough in plastic and
  allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Roll to thinnest
  setting on pasta machine.
  
  Note: Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe.
  They are essential for a light pasta.
  
  For the filling: In a mixing bowl, place the potatoes, bread crumbs,
  meat and cheese and mix with a fork. Add milk, little by little,
  until mass comes together and season with salt, pepper and a pinch of
  cinnamon.
  
  Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.
  
  Roll out the pasta and cut sheet horizontally. Cut each strip into
  4-inch strips to yield 4-inch long by 3-inch wide rectangles. Place 1
  tablespoon stuffing in center of each piece and fold in half
  lenghtwise. Press edges to seal and pull slightly forward on edges to
  create crescent shape.
  
  Place in boiling water and cook until "al dente".
  
  Meanwhile, melt the butter and veal stock. Toss to coat with grated
  cheese and serve.

      Title: Peking Duck (Adapted From Recipe From Shun Lee Palace)
 Categories: Taste
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  4 1/2    -5 Peking duck, head intact
           With cavity hole as small as
           Possible
      6 c  Water
      1 ts Honey
      4 tb Rice wine
      2 tb White vinegar
      5 tb Cornstarch slurry (mixed
           With water to a gravy
           Consistency)
           Vegetable oil for deep
           Frying
           For the Pancakes:
      3 c  All-purpose flour
  1 1/2 c  Boiling water
      1 tb Cold water
           Sesame oil to taste
           Scallion Brushes and Hoisin
           Sauce as accompaniments, if
           Desired
 
  Remove wing tips and feet from duck. Neck skin should be intact with
  only a tiny hole made about 2 inches above the base of the neck.
  Remove cavity fat and discard.
  
  Rinse the duck and massage the entire body by rubbing the skin back
  and forth, loosening it from the meat. Make sure skin is not
  punctured. Insert a bicycle pump hose into the neck hole. Keep cavity
  closed as you pump air into the duck -- inflating it until the skin
  is taut, rubbing and rolling the skin as it is being inflated to
  distribute air evenly. Insert a meat hook through the neck bone and
  hang to dry, in a cool place, for 1 hour.
  
  In a wok combine the boiling water, honey, rice wine, white vinegar,
  and cornstarch slurry, and stir until lightly thickened. Hold the
  duck by the hook and dip it in and out of the boiling water, turning
  it from side to side, while ladling water over the skin. Do this
  until the skin is well coated, about 1 minute. Then hang duck up to
  dry for at least 12 hours or overnight in a draft near a window or
  other breezy place, spreading paper on floor to catch drippings. If
  no cool area is available, hang duck from back of a chair and blow a
  fan on it for several hours. (Alternatively, set duck, unwrapped, on
  a rack with a pan underneath to catch drippings. Refrigerate, turning
  occasionally.)
  
  If your oven is large and tall, remove all racks except the top one.
  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Cover a large pan with aluminum foil
  to reflect heat and to catch drippings and place the pan in the
  bottom of the oven. Hook the duck vertically over the top rack in the
  center of the oven over the drip pan. Roast for 15 minutes. Reduce
  heat to 350 and roast for 1
      1/4    hours.
  
  (Alternatively, use a vertical roasting rack set in a roasting pan and
  roast as above. Or place the duck on a rack over the roasting pan in
  the middle of the oven and roast at 425 F. for 15 minutes. Turn
  breast side down and roast another 15 minutes. Turn again, reduce
  heat to 350 and roast for 3/4 hour.
  
  For the pancakes: Mix the flour with the boiling water until
  combined, and add 1 tablespoon cold water to mixture. Knead the dough
  for 4 minutes, or until soft and smooth. Let it rest for 30 minutes,
  covered with a bowl.
  
  Divide the dough into 2 equal portions and knead it until smooth.
  Roll one portion into a 16-inch log and divide it into 16 pieces.
  Repeat with the remaining dough. Take each piece and stand it upright
  on the heel of your hand, round off the dough and then flatten it
  with your other hand into a circle 2-2 1/2 inches in diameter. Paint
  surface of half of the pieces with pastry brush dipped in sesame oil;
  place remaining pieces on the oiled pieces, making 16 pairs. Using
  rolling pin roll the pairs into thin pancakes about 6-6 1/4 inches in
  diameter, rotating circles frequently to insure even thickness.
  
  Heat an unoiled frying pan until hot. Add 1 pair of cakes and fry 1
  minute or until light brown spots appear underneath. Lift up the
  edges to check for spots. Turn them over and allow them to puff up,
  indicating they are done. Separate each pair into 2 pancakes. Repeat
  with remaining pancakes. Transfer the pancakes to a steamer and steam
  them for 5-10 minutes.
  
  To finish the duck: Put the duck in a wok with 4-6-inches of oil,
  heated to 375 degrees.. Ladle the oil over duck. Cook the duck in
  this fashion for 2 1/2 minutes per side to crisp the skin.
  
  Put the duck on a cutting board. Disjoint the wings and drumsticks and
  place them apart at either end of serving platter, outlining the form
  of a whole duck. With a razor sharp knife carve the skin on the duck
  with a very thin layer of meat, trying to make slices as large as
  possible. Transfer them to the platter. Remove all the meat from the
  carcass and cut it into strips about
  
  1 2 inches long. Arrange the meat strips in center of platter and
  then cut the strips of skin crosswise into comparable pieces. Lay
  these over meat.
  
  To eat: put a pancake on a plate, smear on some Hoisin sauce (with
  scallion brush if desired) and top with 1-2 pieces of skin, either on
  their own or with meat as well. Add a scallion brush and roll up the
  pancake.

      1 tb Sesame oil
      2 ts Sugar
      2 ts Freshly grated ginger
      2 tb Cornstarch
      1 ts Coarse salt
    1/2 ts Finely ground black pepper
     30    Shao mai or dumpling
           Wrappers
 
  Combine the pork, water chestnuts, soy sauce, vinegar, oil, sugar,
  ginger, cornstarch, salt and pepper in a bowl and mix well to combine
  (hands work well for this). Place a dumpling wrapper in the palm of
  one hand and cup it loosely. Place a generous tablespoon of filling
  in the center of the wrapper. With your free hand, gather the sides
  of the wrapper around the filling, letting the wrapper pleat
  naturally. Squeeze the middle gently and tap the dumpling to flatten
  the bottom so that it can stand upright. The meat filling will show a
  little at the top. Make the remaining dumplings in the same manner.
  
  Arrange filled dumplings about 1/4 inch apart in two steamer trays
  that have been lined with wet cheesecloth. (At this point, you can
  refrigerate dumplings, covered, for 23 hours.)
  
  When ready to steam, fill a wok or lower part of a steamer with water
  so that it comes within an inch of the steamer tray, and bring to a
  rolling boil. Stack the steamer trays in the wok or steamer, cover
  tightly, and steam dumplings for 2025 minutes over high heat,
  reversing the trays after 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer
  dumplings to a platter and serve with Spicy Dipping Sauce.
  
  Yield: 30 dumplings

      Title: Tea Smoked Chicken
 Categories: Toohot
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 lb Whole chicken
      1 ts Ground Szechwan peppercorn
      1 tb Salt
      1 ts Fivespice powder
           Smoking Mixture:
    1/2 c  Black tea leaves
    1/2 c  Brown sugar
    1/2 c  Raw rice
      2    To3 chunks fresh ginger
      2    To3 large strips of orange
           Zest
      2 tb Sesame oil
           Scallion brushes
 
  Wash the chicken and pat dry inside and out with paper towels. Combine
  Szechwan peppercorns, salt, and fivespice powder in a small bowl. Rub
  the seasonings into the outside and inside cavity of the bird. Place
  the chicken in a large bowl, cover, and refrigerate 8 hours or
  overnight.
  
  Fill the lower part of a steamer with enough water to come within an
  inch of the cooking rack. Bring the water to a rolling boil, place
  the chicken on the rack, and cover the steamer. Steam the chicken for
  45 minutes, keeping the water at a boil and replenishing it as it
  boils away.
  
  Line a large wok or a heavy Dutch oven with tightfitting lid with
  heavyduty aluminum foil.
  
  Combine the smoking mixture ingredients and spread over the foil in
  the bottom of the pot. Turn the heat under the pot to high and place
  a rack about 3inches above the smoking mixture so that the chicken
  does not touch it. Place the chicken on the rack, breast side up.
  Line the inside of the lid with more foil, leaving an excess of
  3inches around the lid. Cover the pot tightly and crimp the foil down
  so the lid fits securely and smoke doesn't escape.
  
  After you detect smoke, smoke the chicken for 20 to 25 minutes. Turn
  off the heat and let the smoke subside, about 5 minutes. The chicken
  should be a rich, golden brown on the outside.
  
  Lift out the smoked chicken and transfer to a cutting board.
  Immediately brush the sesame oil lightly over the outside. Allow
  chicken to cool, about 10 minutes. To serve, cut off the wings and
  legs. Divide the body of the chicken in half lengthwise by cutting
  through the breast and backbone. Lay the halves flat on the cutting
  board, skinside up, and use a cleaver to chop through each half,
  bones and all, into 3 to 4 equal pieces. Chop the wings and legs into
  pieces as well. Arrange the chicken pieces on a large platter, and
  garnish with the scallion brushes.

  pepper, and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes, tossing to heat through.

      Title: Top Ten Hot Tamale Tips For Cooking Scandinavian Dishes A
 Categories: Toohot
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Text only
 
  Tip number 10:
  
  Mind your peas! When you're cooking split peas, that Swedish favorite,
  always keep the pot covered and don't rush them.
  
  Tip number 9:
  
  Don't smoke in bed! But try smoking in your kitchen... fish, that is.
  Smoked fish is a scandinavian mainstay, but remember, you don't need a
  fancy smoker. Just jerryrig one out of an old pot. If you only have
  nice, shiny, new pots, line them with aluminum foil to protect them.
  
  Tip number 8:
  
  Don't abuse your meatballs! treat them gently... don't overmix them or
  they'll be heavy and tough. And to make it a faster and easier
  process, wet your hands to form the balls.
  
  Tip number 7:
  
  Planning a party? Think smorrebrods! You know, these wonderful Danish
  openfaced minisandwiches. They make great party food; just think of
  your favorite sandwich fillings and make smaller, fingerfood versions
  of them on dark bread.
  
  Tip number 6:
  
  Treat your soupbowls like margarita glasses! hold the salt, but put
  mustard around the rim of your soup bowls when you're serving up bean
  or hambased soups. It really punches up the flavor.
  
  Tip number 5:
  
  Forget the oatbran! and get your roughage the scandinavian way, by
  eating crispbread.
  
  Tip number 4:
  
  Embrace butter! They do love their butter in scandinavia and it is
  really worth loving the Danes make wonderful butter. It's a necessary
  component in smorrebrod. They smear it on the bread to keep it from
  getting soggy under those great fillings.
  
  Tip number 3:
  
  Give your pancake batter a break! For great Swedish pancakes, let the
  batter rest. Make it the night before and refrigerate it. The next
  morning you'll wind up with tender, slim, evenly cooked pancakes.
  
  Tip number 2:
  
  Serving gravlax? Sharpen that knife! Don't even think about slicing
  gravlax with a dull knife you'll just shred it. To do the job
  properly, sharpen a long slicer, hold it at an angle, and starting at
  the tail end, cut very thin slices. They should actually be
  translucent.
  
  And the number one tamale tip for cooking scandinavian at home is...
  
  Keep up your spirits by freezing them! Keep your aquavit or your
  vodka in the freezer, or better yet, freeze them in a block of ice.
  Just put the bottle in a milk carton filled with water, put it in the
  freezer (or outside if it's cold enough), and peel away the cardboard
  when the water has frozen.
  
  If you serve your spirits like this, you can have it out on the table
  all night. or as long as it lasts, anyway.

  Cover with a damp cloth and set aside to rest 15 minutes. Divide
  dough into 4 equal pieces. Set 3 pieces aside, under cloth, and begin
  rolling fourth.
  
  First flatten by hand. Then, with pasta machine at widest setting,
  roll 3 times, folding in half lengthwise between turns. It should be
  smooth and wide as the rollers. Reduce setting, rolling dough through
  once at each, until you reach the next to the thinnest setting.
  
  Trim dough into 12-inch lengths, dust with flour, and cut with

  Frozen pearl onions are a super easy way to introduce a savory note to
  legumes as they are cooking. Lentils are the quickest cooking member
  of the legume family and need no soaking since the seed coat is very

      3    Pears, peeled, cored and
           Halved
  1 1/2 c  Pastry flour
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar
    3/4 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Sour cream
      3 lg Egg yolks
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Spread the almonds on a baking sheet and toast, shaking the pan
  occasionally, until lightly golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside to
  cool. Turn the oven temperature down to 325 degrees F.
  
  Stir together the melted butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger,
  allspice, cloves and corn syrup and evenly coat the bottom and sides
  of a 10 inch glass pie plate with the mixture. When the almonds are
  cool, arrange around the bottom rim of the pie plate, with a few in
  the center, pressing them into the brown sugar mixture. Arrange the
  pear halves like spokes of a wheel on top of the brown sugar mixture.
  
  In a mixing bowl, combine the pastry flour, granulated sugar, baking
  powder, baking soda and salt and thoroughly mix.
  
  In another bowl, whisk together the softened butter, sour cream, egg
  yolks and vanilla. Add to the dry ingredients and mix with an
  electric mixer at medium speed about 1 1/2 minutes, scraping down the
  sides of the bowl occasionally, until thick and smooth.
  
  Using a spatula, spread the batter evenly over the fruit, building up
  the outside edges so the cake will be level when baked. Bake 40 to 50
  minutes, until golden brown and a tester inserted in the center comes
  out clean. Transfer to a rack and cool 3 to 5 minutes (no longer) and
  then invert onto a serving plate, repositioning the fruit as
  necessary.

  through for 5 minutes. If to be poached, break the eggs gently into
  the mixture and cook for 3 minutes.
  
  This dish can be served with rice or with snippets of toast or good
  bread to mop up the delicious juice.

      Title: A Luau

  The idea of building a pit to cook is as old as time. What you cook
  can be as complicated or as easy as you want, and its size can be
  whatever the labor force allows--a much better usage for bob a job
  week than ruining the paintwork on your car. Suggestions for food to
  cook are ears of corn, potatoes, fish fillets wrapped in foil with
  butter and seasoning, chops or sausages wrapped in foil, clams,
  mussels, or lobsters. Use your imagination and experiment.
  
  1. Drive 4 posts into the ground to delineate a rectangular area
  about 5 by 8 feet. Dig out to a depth of 18 inches, banking the sand
  around the edges.
  
  2. Line the pit with smooth, dry pebbles or bricks.
  
  3. Start a small fire on top of the stones in the middle and
  gradually add logs until you fill the whole pit.
  
  4. Keep the fire stoked for at least an hour, then allow to burn down
  for another hour to ensure the stones are properly heated.
  
  5. Carefully rake the embers from the pit without disturbing the
  stones.
  
  6. As quickly as possible, spread well-rinsed seaweed or non-poisonous
  green leaves over the stones in a layer about 6 inches deep.
  
  7. Lay the prepared food in a single layer on top of the seaweed.
  
  8. Spread a 6 inch layer of seaweed over the food. Make sure the food
  is completely covered.
  
  9. Cover with a tarp that extends at least 12 inches beyond the sides
  of the pit. Weigh down the edges with stones. Let the food cook for
  at least 3 hours.

      Title: Quesillo En Salsa Verde
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  Water
  3 1/2 lb Tomatillos, husked and
           Washed
      2 lg White onions, thinly sliced
      9    Serrano chiles
      9    Cloves garlic
      1 bn Cilantro, leaves only
    3/4 ts Salt
     12    (1/4inch thick) slices
           Oaxaca, Mexican Manchego, or
           Asadero cheese
           (about 1 1/2 pounds)
           Extra sprigs of cilantro,
           For garnish
      6    Whole, trimmed scallions,
           Charred on a grill until
           Marked, then sliced
           Into 1/2inch lengths
           Wedges of toasted country
           Bread, for serving
 
  In a heavy saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Add the tomatillos,
  3/4 of the sliced onion, 6 of the chiles, and 6 of the garlic cloves.
  Simmer the mixture covered for about 30 minutes, or until the
  tomatillos are tender. Cool slightly and transfer to a blender or
  food processor. Add the remaining onion, chiles, and garlic,
  cilantro, and salt. Puree the mixture. Preheat the oven to its lowest
  heat and heat a wellseasoned flat griddle pan or castiron skillet
  over medium heat. Brush each slice of cheese with a little oil, then
  grill the slices for about 20 seconds on each side. You will need a
  heavy metal spatula to turn them, scraping all the golden crust from
  the pan and flipping it over. You will have to grill the cheese in
  batches, transferring the cooked cheeses to a platter in the oven
  while you finish cooking, but do not let the cheese melt. Place 2
  slices of cheese on each of 6 warmed appetizer plates, pour the hot
  tomatillo sauce over the top and serve immediately, garnished with
  sprigs of cilantro and charred scallions. Accompany with wedges of
  toasted country bread.

 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      6    (8inch) wooden skewers
      8    Cascabele chiles, stemmed
           And seeded
  2 1/2 c  Water
    1/4 c  Olive oil
    1/2    White onion, thinly sliced
      4    Cloves garlic
      1    Roasted tomato (see Note)
      1 ts Cumin seeds
      2    Bay leaves
      1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    3/4 ts Salt
      3 lb Beef filet, cut into 3/4inch
           Cubes
      2    Green bell peppers, sliced
           Into 1inch squares
      2 lg Red onions, sliced into
      1    Inch squares
           Freshly ground black pepper
      2 tb Olive oil
           Salt and freshly ground
           Black pepper
      8 lg Corn Tortillas, for serving
 
  Soak the skewers in water for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 or 3.
  
  To make the sauce, toast the chiles directly over a gas flame or in a
  castiron skillet until soft and brown, turning frequently to avoid
  scorching. Transfer the roasted chiles to a saucepan and add the
  water. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes,
  or until softened. Transfer the chiles and cooking water to a blender
  and puree until a smooth paste forms. Set aside. In a medium, heavy
  saucepan heat the oil over mediumhigh heat.
  
  Saute the onion for about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until
  golden. Add the garlic and stir for a moment, just to release the
  aroma, then add the reserved chile paste, tomato, cumin, bay leaves,
  pepper, and salt. Reduce the heat to mediumlow and cook, partially
  covered, for about 20 minutes more, stirring occasionally. Return the
  sauce to the blender and blend again until smooth, adding a little
  more water if necessary to make the sauce move freely. Let cool.
  
  Drain the skewers and make the brochettes by alternating cubes of
  beef, bell pepper, and red onion pieces. Leave 2 inches at the bottom
  of each skewer bare so that you will have room to grab and turn them.
  Heat a grill or griddle pan to high heat. Brush the skewers with a
  little olive oil and season to taste. Grill for 1 minute on each
  side, then brush generously with the sauce. Grill for another minute
  on each side, or until done to your liking. Spread a little of the
  sauce on each of 6 warm plates and serve a brochette in the center
  and a warm corn tortilla on the side. Pass the remaining sauce.
  
  Yield: 6 servings
  
  Note: To roast a tomato, heat a dry skillet or griddle over high heat.
  Roast the whole tomato, turning when the bottom is slightly charred,
  until it is golden brown with charred patches on all sides, but not
  burned (the flesh will be quite mushy). Leave the skin on.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Unconverted longgrain rice
      8 oz Tomatoes, roughly chopped
           With the skin on
    1/2 sm Onion, finely chopped
      1    Clove garlic, coarsely
           Chopped
    1/3 c  Vegetable oil, chicken fat,
           Or lard
  3 1/2 c  Light chicken broth
    1/2 md Carrot, cut into 1/4inch

  water, and drain again, shaking thoroughly. In a blender, combine the
  tomatoes, onion, and garlic and blend until smooth, scraping down the
  sides of the container as necessary. Set aside.
  
  In a large heavy saucepan, heat the oil over mediumhigh heat. Add the
  rice and cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice turns a light
  golden color, about 10 minutes. Do not let it scorch. Add the tomato
  puree and fry, scraping the bottom of the pan to stop the mixture
  from sticking, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until all the liquid has been
  absorbed. Add the chicken broth, carrots, zucchini, and giblets, if
  using. Stir in the salt and reduce the heat to mediumlow. Cook the
  rice uncovered and undisturbed until almost all of the broth has
  evaporated and little air holes form in the surface. Cover the top of
  the pan with a towel and the lid, reduce the heat to very low, and
  cook for 5 minutes more. Remove the pan from the heat and let rest
  for 10 minutes more, so that the rice can absorb the steam and swell.
  Just before serving, turn the rice over from the bottom so that the
  juices are redistributed.

      3    Limes
      2    Grapefruit
      1 tb Salt
      3 qt Orange juice, or as needed
  1 1/2 qt Water
      3 c  Sugar
      2    Cinnamon sticks
           Fresh fromage blanc or
           Farmers cheese, for serving
      1 ts Ground cinnamon, for
           Garnish
 
  With a sharp knife, remove the zest from the all the fruits, leaving
  the white pith. Freeze the zest for another use. Cut the fruit into
  quarters and gently squeeze the juice out of them into a bowl. Strain
  out the seeds and reserve the juice. Cut all the fruit into 3/4inch
  lengthwise strips.
  
  In a large saucepan, combine the citrus strips with the salt and a
  generous amount of water. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce the heat
  so that the liquid is simmering. Cook for 25 minutes, then drain.
  Cover the fruit slices with fresh water and soak for 4 hours,
  changing the water every hour.
  
  Measure the reserved fruit juice and add enough extra juice to make
  the amount up to 4 quarts. In a large, nonreactive stock pot, combine
  the water, fruit juice, sugar, and cinnamon sticks. Stir the mixture
  over low heat until the sugar has dissolved, then simmer until the
  liquid has reduced by just over half, to 2 quarts (this will take 3
  1/2 to 4 hours, and the liquid will be dark brown). Add the fruits to
  the mixture and continue simmering for about 1 hour, stirring
  occasionally, until the fruit has absorbed some of the syrup and are
  golden. Remove from the heat and allow to cool until just warmer than
  room temperature (if allowed to go cold the mixture will get too
  thick). Spoon some of the fruits, with their syrup, into bowls and
  garnish with a scoop of fromage blanc and a drift of ground cinnamon.

  orange zest and bring to a boil over mediumhigh heat. Remove from the
  heat.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, combine the egg yolks and sugar and whisk
  until the mixture is pale yellow and thickened. Whisking all the
  time, pour in the hot cream mixture. Whisk until well combined and
  then stir in the citrus juices and vanilla. Strain into a large, flat
  container and chill until cold. Freeze in an ice cream maker
  according to the manufacturers
  
  instructions. Store in the freezer for up to 2 days, if desired.

      Title: Pollito Tia Clara
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    (3 pound) roasting chicken,
           Free-range if possible
      3    Cloves garlic, finely
           Chopped
           Salt
      2 tb Paprika
    1/4    Red wine vinegar
    1/3 c  Spanish olive oil
      4    Plum tomatoes, peeled,
           Seeded, and chopped (or use
           Canned plum tomatoes)
      2 md Onions, finely chopped
      3 tb Unsalted butter, cut into 4
           Pieces
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      2 tb Finely chopped parsley, for
           Garnish
 
  Rinse the chicken, remove any excess fat from around the vent, and
  pat dry with paper towels. In a small bowl, mix together the garlic,
  1 teaspoon salt, paprika, and vinegar. Use this mixture to rub all
  over and inside the cavity of the chicken. Cover the chicken and let
  it sit on a platter for 1 hour.
  
  Heat a large castiron skillet over mediumhigh heat and add the olive
  oil. Shake the chicken from both ends to drain off the excess
  vinegar. Using kitchen tongs and a large wooden spoon to steady the
  bird, brown it on all sides in the hot oil. This will take a good 10
  to 15 minutes.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large enamel and castiron
  casserole, combine the tomatoes, onions, butter, 1/2 teaspoon salt
  and the black pepper. Add 1/2 cup water and set the chicken on top of
  this mixture.
  
  Roast the chicken for 20 minutes per pound, or until the thigh meat
  is done through with no trace of pink remaining. Transfer the chicken
  to a warm serving platter and cover loosely with aluminum foil, while
  you tip the casserole to one side and spoon off the excess fat. Carve
  the chicken into serving pieces as desired, and serve with some of
  the vegetables from the pan, sprinkled with the parsley.

           Pieces
           Salt and freshly ground
           Black pepper
      3 tb Ground dried shrimp (see
           Note 2)
      1 lb Jumbo shrimp, peeled and
           Deveined
    1/3 c  Roasted peanuts
      2 tb Dende oil (see Note 1)
      1 md Onion, very finely chopped
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      1 ts Red chile flakes
    3/4 c  Water
      1 bn Cilantro, leaves only,
           Finely chopped

           Cooked white rice, for

     12    Cooked jumbo shrimp, for

      1    Red bell pepper, stemmed,
           Seeded, and cut into fine
           Julienne for garnish
           Whole sprigs of cilantro,
           For garnish
           Wedges of lemon, for
           Serving
 
  In a medium heavy skillet, heat the olive oil over high heat. Add the
  okra and toss constantly until seared and golden, about 2 minutes.
  Remove from the heat, season to taste with salt and pepper and set
  aside.
  
  In the bowl of a food processor, combine the ground dried shrimp with
  the fresh shrimp and peanuts. Pulse, scraping down the sides of the
  bowl as necessary, until the mixture forms a chunky paste.
  
  In a large, heavy skillet heat the dende oil over medium heat. Add the
  onion, garlic and chile flakes and cook, stirring frequently, for 2
  to 3 minutes, until golden. Add the shrimp paste, 1/2 teaspoon salt,
  and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and stir to mix. Pour in the water and bring
  to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the caruru gently for
  30 minutes, stirring occasionally. The mixture will be quite thick.
  Stir in the reserved okra, cilantro and Tabasco and cook for 2
  minutes more, until the okra is heated through. Serve over white
  rice, garnished with the cooked jumbo shrimp, red pepper julienne,
  cilantro sprigs and lemon wedges.
  
  Yield: 6 servings
  
  Note 1: Dende oil is Brazilian palm oil, available in Latin American
  markets. Be sure to get the Brazilian rather than the West African
  product, which is much heavier. Or use half the amount of the West
  African palm oil and substitute vegetable oil for the other half.
  
  Note 2: The ground dried shrimp that are used in Brazilian dishes can
  occasionally be found in
  
  WestAfrican markets, but the variety that is widely available in
  Chinese markets will do nicely. It is easiest to grind them in a
  coffee grinder, if you have one that is reserved for grinding spices.
  Otherwise, use a food processor.

      2 qt Chicken broth, preferably
           Homemade
      1 lg Chicken breast (about 1 1/4
           Pounds)
      1    Sprig each fresh thyme and
           Fresh oregano
      1 tb Lard or vegetable oil
      1    Yellow onion, diced
      1 lg Carrot, peeled and diced
      2 lg Cloves garlic, finely
           Chopped
      2 oz Cooked ham, cut into 1/4inch
           Dice
      1    (15 ounce) can garbanzo
           Beans (chickpeas), rinsed
           And drained
      1    Sprig epazote
    1/2 ts Salt
      5    Canned chipotle chiles,
           Stemmed and thinly sliced
      1 lg Ripe avocado, peeled, stoned
           And diced
      1 lg Lime, cut into 6 wedges
 
  In a very large soup pot, combine the chicken stock and the chicken
  breast and bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Skim off the
  foam that rises to the surface during the first minute or two after
  it begins to simmer. Add the herbs, cover and simmer for 9 minutes.
  Remove from the heat and let the chicken cool in the broth. Remove
  the skin and bones from the breast, shred the meat and set it aside.
  Strain the broth into a large bowl, skim the fat from the surface,
  and clean the pot.
  
  Place the dry soup pot over medium heat and add the lard. Saute the
  onion and carrot, stirring occasionally, for about 7 minutes, or
  until just beginning to turn golden. Add the garlic and cook for 1
  minute more, until its aroma is released. Stir in the chicken broth,
  ham, garbanzos, and epazote. Partially cover the pan and regulate the
  heat so the soup is simmering, for 30 minutes. Add about 1/2 teaspoon
  of salt, tasting to see if more or less is needed depending on the
  saltiness of the broth. Remove the herb sprigs.
  
  Add the chile and shredded chicken to the simmering broth and cook
  until heated through, about 2 minutes. Ladle the soup into warm bowls
  and garnish each bowl with diced avocado and a wedge of lime.

           Inches thick
           Salt and freshly ground
           Black pepper
      1 tb Olive oil, for brushing

    1/2 c  Canned chipotle chiles,

           Chopped
    1/3 c  Extravirgin olive oil
    1/4 c  Fresh lime juice
  2 1/2 tb White wine vinegar
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Cracked black pepper
      2 lg Cloves garlic, minced
      3    Anaheim chiles, roasted,
           Peeled, stemmed, and seeded
           (see Note)
    1/2    Hothouse cucumber, peeled
           And cut into 1/4inch dice
      5    Radishes, cut into 1/4inch
           Dice
      1 bn Cilantro, leaves only,
           Finely chopped
    1/2    Head romaine lettuce, pale
           Inner leaves only, coarsely
           Julienned
      2    Ripe plum tomatoes, cut into
           Julienne
 
  Heat a well-seasoned castiron frying pan or griddle to high heat.
  Season the steaks generously with salt and pepper and brush them with
  a little olive oil. Sear the steaks for about 4 minutes on each side,
  depending on their thickness, for mediumrare meat. Remove from the
  heat and allow to cool almost to room temperature.
  
  Trim the stem and flower ends of the red onion and cut it in half
  crosswise. Pressing from the bottoms, pop the onion sections out so
  that you have 6 goodsized onioncups. Set aside and cut the remaining
  onion into 1/4inch dice.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the chopped chipotles, olive
  oil, lime juice, vinegar, salt, cracked pepper and garlic until well
  blended. Cut the Anaheim chiles into 1/4inch dice and add them to the
  bowl, along with the diced red onion, cucumber, radishes, and
  cilantro.
  
  Slice the beef across the grain on the diagonal into 3/8inch slices.
  Spread a layer of the romaine on each plate and distribute some of
  the beef and the tomatoes on top. Spoon the dressing, with all its
  chunky ingredients, over the top and serve immediately.
  
  Yield: 6 servings
  
  Note: Fresh chiles and bell peppers can be roasted over a gas flame
  or on a tray under the broiler. Keep turning so the skin is evenly
  charred, without burning and drying out the flesh. Transfer the
  charred peppers to a plastic bag, tie the top closed and let steam
  until cool to the touch, about 15 minutes. (If you are rushed, you
  can place the bag in a bowl of iced water to speed things up.) The
  best way to peel is just to pull off the charred skin by hand and
  then dip the peppers briefly in water to remove any blackened bits.
  Do not peel the pepper under running water since that will wash away
  flavorful juices. Once peeled, cut away stems, seeds and veins.

      2 lb Grated Mexican Manchego
           Cheese
      3    Jalapeno chiles, stemmed and
           Sliced into thin disks
      1 sm Bunch cilantro, leaves only,

      1 sm Yellow onion, cut into
    1/4    Inch dice
           Canola or vegetable oil for

     24    White corn tortillas
      1 c  Crumbled panela
           Sprigs of cilantro, for
           Garnish
 
  To make the sauce: Wash the chiles and remove their stems, seeds, and
  veins. Bring the water to a boil in a medium sized saucepan and add
  the chiles. Cover the pan and remove it from the heat. Soak for 1
  hour, or until softened, then drain, reserving the soaking water.
  
  In a blender, combine the chiles and their soaking water with the
  garlic, onion, cumin, salt, pepper, sugar, and oregano. Puree the
  sauce until smooth, adding a little more of the soaking water if it
  is too thick.
  
  In a wide saute pan large enough to fit the diameter of the
  tortillas, heat the olive oil over mediumlow heat. Add the sauce and
  cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened
  slightly. Taste for seasoning, cover and keep warm at the back of the
  stove.
  
  To make the enchiladas: In a mixing bowl, combine the cheese, chiles,
  cilantro and the onions and toss to mix.
  
  In another large skillet, heat 1 inch of canola oil over mediumhigh
  heat. When it is hot, fry the tortillas, one at a time, for about 30
  seconds, or until slightly golden but still pliable. Drain on paper
  towels.
  
  Preheat the oven to warm. Ladle some of the sauce in the center of a
  warm plate. Coat each tortilla with sauce by dipping it into the pan,
  then place it on the plate. Scatter about 1/4 cup of the cheesechile
  mixture over, then dip and stack another tortilla. Scatter with the
  cheese and make another layer in the same way. Top with a fourth
  dipped tortilla and keep warm in the oven while you finish stacking
  the dipped tortillas and cheese to make 5 more servings. Top each
  stack with a little more sauce, some of the crumbled panela, and a
  few sprigs of cilantro and serve immediately.

  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      2 lg Onions, thinly sliced
      6 lg Eggs
 
  Halve the potatoes lengthwise and, with a sharp knife or, preferably,
  a mandoline, slice them crosswise about 1/16inch thick. Toss the
  potatoes with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and half of the pepper. In
  9inch castiron skillet, heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil over medium
  heat. Add the potatoes and cook, tossing occasionally with a spatula,
  until golden and crisp. Try to avoid clumping but, if they stick
  together a bit don't worry. Set the pan aside.
  
  Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in another skillet over
  medium-low heat and saute the onions, stirring occasionally, for
  about 20 minutes, or until very soft and slightly golden.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, beat the eggs
  together and stir in the remaining 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and
  pepper, and the onions. Remove the potatoes from the pan with a
  slotted spoon and let them drain for a moment in a colander. Wipe the
  potatocooking pan with a paper towel, then add the remaining 2
  tablespoons oil to the skillet. Heat the skillet over low heat, stir
  the potatoes into the egg mixture, and immediately pour it into the
  hot skillet. Cook for about 8 minutes, or until the bottom of the
  cake is slightly golden. Place a large plate upside down on top of
  the skillet, invert it, and turn the cake onto the plate. Slide the
  cake back into the pan. Finish cooking in the oven for 4 to 5 more
  minutes, or until the eggs are set. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes,
  then cut into wedges or squares, depending on the number of people
  you want to serve. Serve warm or at room temperature.
  
  Yield: 6 to 10 servings
  
  Variation: Add 2 roasted, peeled, and diced red peppers and 1
  tablespoon of paprika to the onion mixture after it is cooked.

  is rendered out. Remove 1 tablespoon of the fat and discard. Add the
  onions, paprika, leek, and carrot and continue cooking for 20
  minutes, stirring occasionally, until all the vegetables are very
  soft. Add the garlic and cook for 5 minutes more.
  
  Add the ham hocks, bay leaves, salt, pepper, and enough of the
  reserved soaking water to barely cover the ingredients. Bring the
  mixture to a boil and skim off the scum and fat that rise to the
  surface. Reduce the heat and simmer over low heat, partially covered,
  for 1 hour. Add the sausages and the beans and cook for 1 1/2 hours
  more, or until the beans are tender (you may need to add a little
  more water to keep the stew moist and juicy). Remove the ham hocks,
  remove and discard the rind and fat, and shred the meat. Return the
  ham to the pan and discard the bay leaves. Taste for seasoning and
  serve warm, with a small dollop of the salsa verde.

      Title: Mexican Crab Cakes
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3    Whole Dungeness Crabs (about
      6    Pounds), or 1 1/2 pounds
           Picked over
           Crabmeat
      2 lg Eggs
      1 c  Sour cream
      2    Poblano chiles, stemmed,
           Seeded, and finely diced
      1    Yellow bell pepper, stemmed,
           Seeded, and finely diced
      1    Rib celery, finely diced
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1 c  Fresh bread crumbs
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      2 tb Vegetable oil
           Mint and Parsley Salad (for
           Serving, recipe attached)
 
  In a very large stockpot, bring about 6 quarts water to a boil.
  Plunge the crabs headfirst into the water, and cook for 12 minutes
  from the time the water returns to the boil. Remove the crabs with
  tongs and set aside. When cool, remove the triangular belly flap on
  the underside and discard. Turn crab over and starting from rear of
  crab, pull firmly to lift off top shell, and discard. Pull off and
  discard the spongy fingers from the body and the tiny paddles from
  the front. Scoop out the orange crab butter and, if desired, reserve
  for another use. Cut the body into quarters and pick the crabmeat
  from inside, using a small fork or a metal pick, and reserve. Twist
  the claws and legs off of the body. Crack the claws and legs along
  the edges of the shells, using a heavy nutcracker or a small hammer.
  Pick the crabmeat from the claws and legs, and reserve.
  
  Try to keep the crabmeat in fairly large chunks, but make sure you
  get all of it.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs lightly. Add the sour cream,
  diced poblano and yellow peppers, celery, salt, and pepper. Toss
  together until well mixed. Add the crab, shredding it into
  approximately 3/4inch chunks, and the bread crumbs. Mix together
  gently but thoroughly.
  
  Divide the mixture into 12 cakes, shaping them into patties about
  3/4inch thick and 3 inches in diameter. Refrigerate them on a large
  plate, loosely covered, for 1 hour.
  
  Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. In a large heavy skillet, heat 1
  tablespoon of the butter and 1 tablespoon of the oil over mediumhigh
  heat. Saute 6 crab cakes at a time, for about 3 minutes on each side,
  being very careful when you turn them so that they do not fall apart.
  They should be golden brown on each side. Place the cooked crab cakes
  on a baking sheet in the oven to keep warm while you add the
  remaining butter and oil to the pan and saute the other six crab
  cakes in the same way.
  
  Serve warm on Mint and Parsley Salad.

 Categories: Tvfn

      2 tb Cumin seeds
      2    Bay leaves
           Sprig of fresh rosemary or
    1/2 ts Dried
    1/4 c  Olive oil or 4 tablespoons
           Unsalted butter
      2 lg Onions, diced
      2 ts Salt
      4    To 6 garlic cloves, minced
      2 ts Ground cumin
      8 c  Fresh or canned corn
           Kernels
      6    Poblano chiles, roasted,
           Peeled, seeded and diced
           (see Note)
      1 bn Chives, thinly sliced on the
           Diagonal, for garnish
 
  Combine the milk, cumin seeds, bay leaves and rosemary in a medium
  saucepan. Place over low heat and bring nearly to a simmer. (Do not
  boil.) Remove from the heat and let sit 20 minutes to infuse.
  
  Heat the olive oil or butter in a large saucepan or stockpot over
  medium heat. Cook the onions with the salt until golden brown, 15 to
  20 minutes. Add the garlic and ground cumin and cook, stirring
  frequently, 5 minutes. Then stir in the corn kernels and diced chiles
  and continue cooking over low heat 5 more minutes.
  
  Using your finest strainer, strain the infused herbal milk into the
  corn and chile mixture. Bring to a very slow simmer over low heat.
  Gently simmer
       15    minutes.
  
  Pour one third of the soup into a food processor or blender and
  puree. Stir back into the soup pot. Serve hot with the chives as
  garnish.
  
  Note: Fresh chiles and bell peppers can be roasted over a gas flame
  or on a tray under the broiler. Keep turning so the skin is evenly
  charred, without burning and drying out the flesh. Transfer the
  charred peppers to a plastic bag, tie the top closed and let steam
  until cool to the touch, about 15 minutes. (If you are rushed, you
  can place the bag in a bowl of iced water to speed things up.) The
  best way to peel is just to pull off the charred skin by hand and
  then dip the peppers briefly in water to remove any blackened bits.
  Do not peel the pepper under running water since that will wash away
  flavorful juices. Once peeled, cut away stems, seeds and veins.

      2    (1/2-pound) pieces puff
           Pastry, each cut into a
     12    Inch circle.
      1    Egg, lightly beaten
    2/3 c  Guava paste or other fruit
           Jam or puree mixed with 1/4
        c  Freshly
           Squeezed lime juice
      1 tb Heavy cream
 
  Place the cream cheese and panela or farmer cheese in a bowl and mix
  well with a spoon.
  
  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place l of the puff pastry
  circles on the baking sheet. Brush a 1-inch rim around the outside
  edge with some of the beaten egg. Pat the cheese mixture into an
  8-inch circle in the center and spread the guava paste or jam evenly
  over the top.
  
  Fold the remaining piece of puff pastry in half and place over the
  first piece. Unfold the pastry to enclose the filling, being careful
  not to trap air beneath. Gently press the top and bottom edges
  together and refrigerate about 25 minutes, or until the dough is
  thoroughly chilled.
  
  Remove from the refrigerator. Working about 1 1/2 inches from the
  outside, firmly press the edges of pastry together with the tines of
  a fork to seal. Then trim the excess dough, leaving an even 1-inch
  border of crust surrounding the filling. With a sharp paring knife,
  cut out and discard a 1/4-inch circle of dough from the center, and
  press out any trapped air. Then, making shallow cuts, trace 6 to 8
  circular lines in a spiral pattern from the center hole to the inside
  edge of the sealed crust (if the dough gets too warm to work with,
  just return to the refrigerator for 30 minutes or so to harden).
  
  Mix the heavy cream, with the remaining beaten egg and brush over the
  top of the tart: Cover with plastic wrap and chill at least 2 hours or
  overnight.
  
  To bake, preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Transfer the pan from
  refrigerator to the oven and bake 15 minutes, or until puffed and
  golden brown on top. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees. Bake
  until the jelly is bubbling and the bottom crust, when lifted with a
  spatula, is browned, 30 to 40 minutes. Set aside to cool on a rack to
  15 minutes. Serve warm.

    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 ts Salt
      1 ts Ground nutmeg
      1 ts Grated lemon rind
    1/2 c  Warm milk (105 to 115

      2 tb Lemon juice
      2 tb Water
           Purple, green and gold sugar
           Crystals
 
  Preheat the oven 350 degrees. Combine the warm water, yeast and 2
  teaspoons sugar in a small bowl. Mix well and set aside to a warm
  place for about 10 minutes. Combine the 4 cups of flour, 1/2 cup
  sugar, salt, nutmeg, lemon rind and add warm milk, melted butter, egg
  yolks and yeast mixture. Beat until smooth. Turn dough out on a
  lightly floured surface. Kneed in enough remaining flour until the
  dough is no longer sticky. Continue kneading until the dough is
  smooth and elastic (about 10 minutes). Place the dough in a
  well-greased bowl. Turn once so greased surface is on top.
  
  Cover the dough and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk
  (about 1 1/2 hours). Punch the dough down and place on a lightly
  floured surface. Sprinkle with the citron and knead until the citron
  is evenly distributed. Shape the dough into a cylinder, about 30
  inches long. Place the cylinder on a buttered baking sheet. Shape
  into a ring, pinching ends together to seal. Place a well-greased
  2-pound coffee can or shortening can in the center of the ring to
  maintain shape during baking. Press the boy, pecan half or dried bean
  into the ring from the bottom so that it is completely hidden by the
  dough. Covers the ring with a towel, and let rise in a warm place
  until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes.
  
  Bake for 30 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove the coffee can
  immediately. Allow the cake to cool. For the glaze: Combine the
  ingredients and beat until smooth. To assemble, drizzle cake with the
  glaze. Sprinkle with sugar crystals, alternating colors. Cut into the
  cake and hope you do not get the baby.

 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  3 1/2 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
           Plus 1/2 cup
      4    Extra large eggs
    1/2 ts Olive oil
 
  Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting
  board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, oil
  and any other flavoring you choose. Using a fork, beat together the
  eggs, oil and flavorings and begin to incorporate the flour starting
  with the inner rim of the well. As you expand the well, keep pushing
  the flour up to retain the well shape. Do not worry that this initial
  phase looks messy. The dough will come together when 1/2 of the flour
  is incorporated.
  
  Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your
  hands primarily. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from
  the board and scrape up any left over crusty bits. Lightly flour the
  board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough should be
  elastic and a little sticky. Continue to knead for another 3 minutes,
  remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the dough in
  plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Note:
  do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe, they are
  essential for a light pasta.

           Juice of one lemon
      2 tb Flour
        pn Nutmeg
      1 ts Cinnamon
      1 c  Pecan pieces
      1    Recipe pie dough, recipe
           Follows
      4 oz Wisconsin Sharp Cheddar
           Cheese, grated
      8    Scoops of Vanilla Bean Ice
           Cream
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large sauté pan, melt the
  butter. Add the apples and sauté for 2 minutes. Add the sugars, lemon
  juice and flour. Continue to sauté for 2 minutes. Season the apples
  with nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt. Mix thoroughly and remove from the
  heat. Cool the mixture. Cut the dough into 2 halves. Lightly dust the
  surface with flour. Roll out each half of dough to 12 inches in
  diameter and about 1/8-inch thick. Fold one circle of dough in
  fourths. Carefully lift the dough and place in a 10-inch deep dish
  pie pan. Unfold the pie dough and spoon the apples into the pie
  shell. Place the second round of dough over the apples. Using a sharp
  knife, cut away the excess dough. Using your fingers, crimp the edges
  of the pie firmly to seal the dough completely. With the same sharp
  knife, make three slits, about 4 inches long and 2 inches apart,
  across the pie dough. Place the pie in the oven and bake for 45
  minutes. Remove the pie from the oven and sprinkle the cheese over
  the top. Return the pie to the oven and continue to cook for 8
  minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly. Serve warm with vanilla ice
  cream.

      Title: Angel Food Cake
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 c  Sifted confectioners' sugar
      1 c  Sifted cake flour
     11 oz Egg whites (approximately 11
           Eggs)
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Cream of tartar
 
  There are two essentials for a successful angel food cake: absolutely
  grease free preparation and properly beaten whites. Thoroughly wash
  with hot water and soap a 10-inch tube pan and all equipment and
  utensils that you will need. Rinse with clean water and leave
  utensils wet.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. If using a convection oven preheat to
  300 degrees F.
  
  Into a bowl sift together 1 1/2 cups of the confectioners' sugar and
  the cake flour. Set aside.
  
  In a glass or metal bowl (don't use plastic) combine egg whites, salt
  and cream of tartar. Begin beating at medium speed until whites are
  foamy and gradually add remaining 1 1/2 cups of confectioners' sugar.
  Continue beating just until soft peaks form. Time will vary according
  to several factors: age and temperature of whites, temperature of
  your kitchen, and power of your mixer.
  
  Gently fold the flour mixture into the beaten whites.
  
  Immediately pour batter into tube pan and bake in center of oven for
  35 to 45 minutes, depending on the type of oven, or until a cake
  tester inserted in center comes out clean.
  
  Remove cake from oven and immediately invert pan. Let cool completely
  in pan. Do not refrigerate.
  
  To remove cake from pan gently loosen edges with fingers or a thin
  knife. Invert cake onto cardboard circle or serving plate and push
  out on bottom of pan. You can pull on the center tube for help. With
  your hands or a thin knife, gently ease the cake off of the center
  tube.

      Title: Flourless Chocolate Cake 1
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8 oz Bittersweet or semisweet
           Chocolate
    1/2 c  Rum, brandy or strong
           Coffee
    1/2 c  (1 stick) unsalted butter
      6    Egg yolks
    1/3 c  Granulated sugar
      6    Egg whites
           For the icing:
     10 oz Semisweet or bittersweet
           Chocolate, chopped
      1 c  Heavy cream
     12    To 16 ounces Chocolate
           Snaps* or other coating
           Chocolate
 
  *Available at baking and cake decorating departments of cookware
  stores, such as New York Cake and Baking Supply and Broadway
  Panhandler. Most stores have mail order available.
  
  Make the cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. (300 degrees for
  convection oven).
  
  Grease and flour 1 8-inch or 9-inch cake pan. In the top of a double
  boiler or in a bowl set over simmering water combine the chocolate,
  rum, brandy or coffee and butter. In a bowl with an electric mixer
  beat egg yolks and sugar until thick and lemon-colored. Fold
  chocolate mixture into yolk mixture.
  
  In clean grease-free glass or metal bowl, beat whites until soft peaks
  form. Gently fold the chocolate mixture into the whites.
  
  Pour batter into cake pan, transfer pan to middle of preheated oven
  and bake for 30 to 45 minutes, depending on pan size and type of
  oven. Cake will be firm at edges, but will seem under-baked in
  center. Remove from oven and let cool completely in pan. Put cake in
  pan in the refrigerator, overnight if possible. Cake must be cold to
  successfully remove it from the pan.
  
  To remove cake from pan: Cut 2 cardboard circles the same size as the
  pan used. Put one circle on top of cake still in pan. Heat the bottom
  of the cake pan on top of the stove over high heat for approximately
  20 seconds. Remove from heat and invert cake onto cardboard, gently
  tapping pan on table if necessary. Cake will fall out of pan. Put the
  other cardboard circle on bottom of cake and invert cake. Remove
  cardboard from cake top. Keep cake in refrigerator until ready to use.
  
  For the icing: In the top of a double boiler or a heatproof bowl set
  over simmering water melt the chocolate, stirring, until smooth. In a
  small saucepan bring cream just to a boil. Remove pan from heat, add
  melted chocolate and stir until smooth. Transfer melted chocolate to
  a bowl and let cool completely at room temperature. This is called
  Ganache and can be made and stored in the refrigerator for up to one
  month.
  
  To assemble the cake: Ice the top and sides of the cold cake with the
  ganache. If ganache becomes too cold to spread, soften it in a
  microwave oven or on top of stove for a few seconds and stir to
  blend. Use as much or as little of the icing as your taste desires.
  The extra can be stored as stated in the recipe. Put the iced cake on
  a serving platter. Refrigerate if desired.
  
  To decorate the cake: Cut 3 to 4 strips from a new (one-gallon size)
  freezer bag, each 10 1/2 inches long and approximately 5 inches wide.
  There should be enough strips to cover an 8 or 9 inch cake.
  Melt chocolate as described in above instructions. Spread the melted
  chocolate over the entire surface of one strip. While the chocolate is
  still wet, pick up the strip and place it with the chocolate side to
  the cake, aligning the bottom of the strip to the bottom of the cake.
  Allow the top to fold over the top of the cake - just like a piece of
  fabric. Refrigerate until the chocolate strip is cold (this should be
  about a minute or less). Remove cake from the refrigerator and peel
  away the plastic strip from the chocolate. The chocolate will adhere
  to the cake.
  
  Repeat the process with the next strip, and then the third strip. The
  cake will be "wrapped" in a free-form blanket of chocolate. Dust with
  confectioners' sugar before serving.

      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb And 1 teaspoon salt (4
        ts Total)
      1    Recipe Garlic-Basil Dressing
           (recipe follows)
      5    Firm ripe tomatoes, sliced
      4    Sprigs fresh basil for
           Garnish
 
  Leave the pointed tips on the green beans, but snap off the stem tips.
  Wash. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the sugar and 1
  tablespoon salt. Drop in the green beans and cook until crisp-tender,
  about 6 to 7 minutes. Drain the beans and plunge them into ice water
  to stop cooking. Drain well and refrigerate.
  
  When ready to serve, toss the green beans with 1/3 cup of the
  dressing in a large mixing bowl. Taste and add more dressing or salt
  as needed. Pile the beans high in the center of a large white
  platter. Arrange the tomato slices overlapping around the edge.
  Sprinkle the tomatoes with salt and drizzle 3 tablespoons of the
  dressing on top of them. Garnish with the basil sprigs. Serve
  immediately.
  
  *Note: This is one of the better ways to use canned beans if you
  cannot get fresh. The dressing is flavorful enough to cover any
  canned taste. Buy high-quality canned whole beans and rinse several
  times.

 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/3 c  Sugar
           Nonstick cooking spray with
           Flour, such as Baker's Joy,
           Or 1 tablespoon
           Shortening and 1 tablespoon
           Flour, to grease pan
           Parchment or waxed paper
  1 1/2 c  Cake flour
  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Buttermilk at room
           Temperature
      1 ts Pure vanilla extract
    1/4 lb (1 stick) unsalted butter at
           About 65 degrees F (18
           Degrees C)
      2 lg Eggs at room temperature
      3 lg Egg yolks at room
           Temperature
    1/3 c  Vegetable or other
           Mild-flavored oil* (see
           Note)
 
  Place the mixer bowl and whisk beater in the freezer. Measure the
  sugar into a zip-top plastic bag, seal and place in the freezer to
  chill for about 20 minutes.
  
  Place a shelf at the top of the lower third of the oven and preheat
  to 350 degrees.
  
  Grease a 9 by 2-inch round cake pan by spraying with nonstick cooking
  spray with flour or by rubbing the pan with shortening, shaking the
  pan with 1 tablespoon flour, and shaking out the excess. Insert a
  9-inch parchment or waxed paper circle in the pan and lightly spray
  or grease and flour.
  
  Sift the flour, baking powder and salt onto a sheet of waxed paper.
  Resift at least once more onto another piece of waxed paper. Measure
  the buttermilk in a glass measuring cup and add the vanilla.
  
  Cream the butter on medium speed in a mixer with the whisk until
  light in color, about 3 minutes. Add the sugar in a steady stream
  with the mixer running. Continue beating the butter-sugar mixture for
  3 to 4 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl once. Add the
  eggs and yolks one at a time, beating on medium speed for about 30
  seconds after each addition. Continue to beat until the mixture is
  light and airy looking, another 1 to 2 minutes.
  
  Remove the bowl from the mixer and stir in the oil. Fold in half of
  the flour mixture with a large rubber spatula. Scrape down the sides
  of the bowl, then fold in half of the buttermilk-vanilla mixture.
  Fold in the remaining flour and scrape down, then the remaining
  buttermilk-vanilla mixture.
  
  Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Smooth the batter with the
  rubber spatula, leaving the edges a breath higher than the center.
  Bake until a toothpick or cake tester inserted an inch from the
  center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. The sides should just begin
  to pull away from the pan when you place the cake on the rack to cool.
  
  Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 to 20 minutes. Tap the sides of
  the pan on the counter to loosen the cake or run a small spatula
  around the edge. Spray a cooling rack lightly with nonstick spray and
  invert the cake onto it. Peel off the parchment liner, then replace
  the liner on the cake with the sticky side up. Invert back onto the
  original cooling rack so that the cake is now right side up. Cool
  completely before storing or icing.
  
  *Note: Walnut, hazelnut or almond oil is good to use if you would
  like a subtle flavor note. Make sure the oil is not off tasting since
  nut oils turn rancid faster than others.

     16 tb (2 sticks) unsalted butter,
           Softened
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      2 lg Eggs, at room temperature
           One 10-ounce box (about 1
    3/4 c  ) currants
  4 1/2 c  Unbleached, all-purpose
           Flour (spoon flour into cup
           And 1/2 cup
           Measures and level off with

      Title: Barm Brack, Irish Yeast-Risen Tea Cake
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    3/4 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Water
  1 1/2    Envelopes (1 tablespoon)
           Active dry yeast
  1 1/2 c  Unbleached, all-purpose
           Flour
           Dough:
  1 1/2 c  Golden raisins
    1/2 c  Currants
    1/2 c  Diced candied orange or
           Lemon peel, or a
           Combination
      6 tb Soft unsalted butter
    1/3 c  Sugar
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
    1/8 ts Ground cloves
    1/8 ts Ground allspice
      2 lg Eggs
      3 c  Unbleached, all-purpose
           Flour
 
  To make the sponge, in a small saucepan over low flame, heat the milk
  and water until just warm, about 110 degrees. Pour into a small bowl,
  whisk in yeast and stir in flour. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap
  and allow sponge to rise for 30 minutes, or until doubled in bulk.
  
  Combine the raisins, currants and candied peel in a saucepan, cover
  with water and bring to a boil over medium heat. Drain fruit and
  spread it in a single layer on paper towels to cool and dry slightly
  while preparing the dough.
  
  To mix the dough by hand, beat butter with sugar, salt and spices
  until soft and smooth. Beat in eggs, one at a time, then continue
  beating until smooth and light. Stir in sponge and remaining flour.
  Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead it until it is
  smooth and elastic, about
       10    minutes.
  
  To make the dough in a mixer, use a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the
  paddle and beat butter with sugar, salt and spices until soft and
  smooth. Beat in eggs, one at a time, then continue beating until
  smooth and light. Beat in sponge and remaining flour. Continue to mix
  until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.
  
  To mix the dough in the food processor, place butter, sugar, salt,
  spices and eggs in work bowl fitted with metal blade. Pulse 10 or 12
  times at 1-second intervals to mix smooth. Remove metal blade and
  attach plastic blade; add sponge and remaining flour and pulse to
  form a dough. Process continuously for 15 seconds.
  
  Place dough in a buttered bowl and cover with buttered plastic wrap,
  butter side down. Allow dough to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1
  hour.
  
  Punch dough to deflate and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.
  Distribute fruit on dough
  
  and knead it in evenly by continuing to fold dough over onto itself.
  Cover with plastic wrap or a dry towel and allow to rest 30 minutes.
  
  Butter two 8-inch diameter by 2-inch deep cake pans and line the
  bottom of each with a piece of parchment or butter waxed paper, cut
  to fit. Place half the dough in each and press to make tops flat and
  even. Cover pans with buttered plastic wrap or a dry towel and allow
  Bracks to rise until doubled, up to 1 hour.
  
  Once the Bracks have begun to puff visibly, set a rack at the middle
  level of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees. When the Bracks are
  completely risen, bake them for about 45 minutes, or until well risen
  and a deep golden brown. Test by inserting a thin knife or skewer
  near the center; if it is done it will emerge without any raw dough
  clinging to it. Cool on racks for 5 minutes, then unmold and place
  rack on racks to cool completely.
  
  Yield: 2 8-inch cakes, about 20 generous servings

      2 md Pasilla chiles, stemmed,
           Seeded, and deveined
    1/2 ts Coriander seeds
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon (from
           Cinnamon stick)
      1    Clove
      1 ts Dried oregano
    1/4 ts Black peppercorns
    1/4 ts Freshly ground nutmeg
    1/4 ts Ground ginger
      2 tb Best-quality paprika
      2 tb Salt
      4    Cloves garlic, minced
      3 tb Cider vinegar
      1 lb Lean boneless pork shoulder
      4    To 5 feet of hog casings, in
      1    Or 2 pieces
 
  Place a griddle or cast ion skillet over medium heat. Tear the chiles
  into large flat pieces and toast them a few at a time, pressing them
  down with a spatula. When they blister and change color, flip over
  and toast the other side. Cool and transfer to a coffee grinder
  reserved for grinding spices. Add the coriander, cinnamon stick,
  clove, oregano, and peppercorns. Pulverize the spices and sift
  through a medium-mesh sieve into a large bowl. Add the nutmeg,
  ginger, paprika, an salt, then stir in the garlic and vinegar.
  
  Set up a meat grinder fitted with the coarse grinding plate and the
  sausage stuffing attachment, or use a sausage-stuffing funnel for the
  stuffing
  
  procedure. Mix together the pork fat, loin, and shoulder and run them
  through the grinder into the bowl with the spices. Mix the meat and
  the seasonings briefly but thoroughly with your hands. Cover and
  refrigerate overnight.
  
  If the castings were packed in salt, rinse them for an hour before
  using. Run water from the tap through each length of casing to check
  for leaks; either cut the casing where it leaks or discard the piece
  (to be useful, a casing should be at least 30 inches long wit no
  leaks).
  
  Thread one end of a piece of casing over the suffer or the funnel
  mouth, pushing it all the way on but leaving a 3-inch overhang for
  tying off. Begin feeding the sausage meat through; when it first
  comes out, clamp off the end so that the sausage expands to a 1-inch
  diameter. If there is an air bubble, stop the machine and work the
  bubble out towards the funnel end. Feeding the sausage through the
  grinder in an uninterrupted flow, slowly move the casing away from
  the suffer as the sausage fills in a continuous 1-inch diameter link.
  When the sausage is about 6 inches long, pull off an extra 1 inch of
  casing and twist several times, completing one link and starting
  another. Continue until all of the sausage meat has been cased,
  stopping to thread more casing on as necessary.
  
  Either twist the links several more times to separate them, or tie
  pieces of string between them. Place on a rack in the refrigerator,
  uncovered, for about 36 hours or until dry to the touch and somewhat
  firm. Set a dish underneath to catch drips. Wrap in plastic and again
  refrigerate until ready to use.
  
  Yield: 1 1/2 pounds fresh sausage, 1 pound after air-drying.

      Title: Roasted Potato-Chorizo Hors D'oeuvres
 Categories: Toohot
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Baby red potatoes
      3 tb Olive oil
      1 ts Dried oregano, crumbled
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1 lb Chorizo
      1    Lime, quartered
      1    Recipe Arbol-Avocado Salsa
           (recipe follows)
 
  In a saucepan of actively boiling lightly salted water, blanch the
  potatoes for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the tines of a fork will just
  pierce the surface. Drain and, when cool enough to handle, cu them in
  half and score the cut side of each with the tines of a fork.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees an heat a large cast-iron skillet over
  medium heat. In a bowl, combine the potatoes with the olive oil,
  oregano, salt, and pepper and toss together until evenly coated.
  Transfer the potatoes to the hot skillet and spread them out into an
  even layer so they are hardly touching each other. Heat until
  sizzling, then transfer the skillet to the hot oven. Toast, turning
  over every 10 minutes, for about 30 minutes, until very crisp and
  golden.
  
  While the potatoes are roasting, heat a large non-stick skillet over
  medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons water. Cook the sausages for
  about 20 minutes, turning occasionally and pouring off the fat as it
  accumulates. Drain the sausages briefly on a double thickness of
  paper towels and slice them 3/4 thick. Place a slice of sausage on
  top of each roasted potato half and secure with a toothpick. Assemble
  the hors d'oeuvres on a platter and squeeze a little lime juice over
  them. Serve, accompanied by the Arbor-Avocado Salsa.

    1/2 ts Black peppercorns
      1 ts Salt
    2/3 c  Water
      1 c  Masa harina
      6 oz Manchego cheese, cut into 2
    1/2    -inch batons
           Vegetables oil for frying
    1/2 sm Head cabbage, shredded
           Chipotle Salsa, for serving
           (preferably in a squirt
           Bottle)
           Crema, for serving
           (preferably in a squirt
           Bottle)
      2    Limes, quartered
 
  To make the dough: in a small skillet, heat the lard over low heat.
  Saute the ancho for 1 to 2 minutes, to until slightly softened. With
  a slotted spoon, transfer the chile to a blender and add the
  peppercorns, salt, and water. Blend to a smooth puree.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, combine the masa with the chile puree. Knead
  the dough together well. To test the consistency, flatten a small
  ball of dough between your palms. If the edges crack, add water to
  the dough, a tablespoon at a time, until a test piece does not crack.
  Set the masa aside, covered, at room temperature for 1 hour to allow
  the flavor to develop.
  
  Pull off a ball of dough about 2 inches in diameter. Push a piece of
  the cheese into the dough and form the dough around it into a
  football shaped croquette, encasing the cheese completely. Finish
  making the croquettes and heat about 1 inch of vegetable oil to 375
  degrees. Fry the croquettes in the hot oil, burning them over when
  golden, for about 3 to 4 minutes. Drain briefly on a double thickness
  of paper towels and transfer to a warmed platter. Scatter the
  shredded cabbage in a thin layer over the top and squeeze a little
  lime juice over. Serve with the remaining limes, drizzled with a
  little chipotle salsa and crema.

    1/4 c  Refried Black Beans (recipe
           Follows), or good quality

           Refried beans, pureed
           Approximately 2/3 cup

      2 c  Shredded roasted chicken
      1 c  Roasted Tomato Salsa (recipe

      1 c  Pickled Red Onions (recipe
           Follows)
      1    Avocado, peeled, seeded and
           Sliced, for garnish
 
  Divide the masa into 12 pieces and form each into a ball. Press or
  roll each into a 4-inch circle.
  
  Heat a dry cast-iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat and
  cook the tortillas.
  
  When cool enough to handle, pick up each puffed tortilla and make a 1
  1/2-inch slit about 1/4-inch from the edge to make a pocket, being
  careful not to cut all the way through the tortilla. Stuff 2
  teaspoons of the bean puree in each pocket. Flatten to seal and
  spread the beans evenly. Reserve the stuffed tortillas on a tray
  covered with a barely damp cloth.
  
  Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Fry
  the stuffed tortillas in batches, adding more oil as necessary, until
  they are a little crisp around the edges but still pliable. Drain on
  paper towels. Then place on a tray and keep warm in a 200 degree oven.
  
  Heat the chicken in a small pan over low heat.
  
  Remove the tray of panuchos from the oven. Top each with a scant
  tablespoon of roasted tomato salsa. Sprinkle on the chicken and
  pickled onions and top each with a small avocado slice. Serve warm or
  at room temperature.
  
  Variation: In case your tortillas do not puff, here is an alternative
  plan: fry them as is in the oil, and then spread with a very fine
  layer of beans followed by the other ingredients. They will still
  taste delicious.

  and chill covered with plastic wrap, preferably overnight. *Use pod
  for compote.
  
  Fruit Compote: 1 cup dried cherries 1 cup dried figs 1 cup dried
  pears, sliced 1/2 cup dried currants or blueberries 2 cups dry white
  wine 1 vanilla bean pod
      1/2    cup granulated sugar

  Reduce heat and simmer 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool
  in pan. Remove all fruit and reduce sauce until syrup-like. Combine
  with fruit. Remove pod and set aside until ready to assemble.
  
  Baking: Spread about 1 teaspoon cold tuille batter thinly over
  stencils (professional or homemade) on greased back of cookie sheet.
  Place tuiles in 350 degree F oven. Tuiles will spread and cook
  rapidly. Therefore, test a few, one at a time, for appropriate
  thinness of batter and length of cooking time. If tuiles have spread
  too much, reduce amount of batter and make sure batter is spread
  evenly and thinly. Tuiles should be removed from oven when slightly
  golden. Let set for a few seconds on sheet before removing to rack
  for cooling.
  
  Assemble Napoleon by layering tuiles and fruit compote. Top with ice
  cream, frozen yogurt, or whipped cream.

      2    Pieces of parchment paper
 
  Heat the oil in a large skillet. In a mixing bowl, season the shrimp
  with Essence. Stir in the buttermilk and marinate the shrimp for 1
  hour, under refrigeration. Remove the shrimp from the refrigerator
  and drain completely. In a shallow bowl, combine the flour and masa
  together. Season the flours with Essence. Dredge the shrimp in the
  seasoned flour. Place the shrimp in a wire basket and shake the
  shrimp completely, to remove any excess flour. Carefully fry the
  shrimp in the hot oil until golden brown, about 2 minutes. Remove the
  shrimp from the oil and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season the
  shrimp with salt and pepper. Combine all the remaining ingredients in
  a food processor with a metal blade and process for 30. Place the
  sauce in the refrigerator and chill completely. The sauce will keep
  for several days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. To
  assemble, cut the parchment paper in half and form the paper into a
  cone-like shape. Fill each cone with the fried rock shrimp. Serve the
  cones with the Remoulade sauce.

      Title: Pistachio Marzipan Truffles
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/3 c  Heavy whipping cream
      6 oz Bittersweet chocolate,
           Melted
      1 ts Almond extract
      1 tb Butter
      1 tb Light corn syrup
           Pistachio marzipan:
      8 oz (about 2 cups) blanched
           Pistachios
      4 oz Almond paste
    1/4 c  Confectioners' sugar
      2 tb Light corn syrup
           Enrobing:
     16 oz Semisweet or milk chocolate
     16 oz Blanched pistachios,
           Chopped
 
  To make the centers, bring the cream to a boil and remove from heat.
  Whisk cream into chocolate. Whisk smooth, then whisk in extract,
  butter and corn syrup. Cool the mixture to 80 degrees or until
  thickened.
  
  To blanch the pistachios, remove the shells, place pistachios in a
  saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and drain
  immediately. Place hot pistachios on a towel, fold the towel over to
  cover the pistachios, and rub to loosen the skins. Go over the
  pistachios one by one to separate the kernels from the skins.
  
  To make the pistachio marzipan, place the blanched pistachios, still
  warm, in the bowl of a food processor. Process for a long time,
  scraping down frequently, until they form a paste. Pulse in the
  almond paste, then the confectioners' sugar. Add corn syrup as
  necessary, keeping the marzipan fairly soft. Remove from processor
  and knead smooth. Divide the marzipan into three pieces and roll each
  into a cylinder 12-inches long. Flatten ropes and roll them 2-inches
  wide.
  
  Quickly beat center mixture to lighten and then spoon into a 1/2-inch
  plain tube (Ateco #6 or #806). Pipe down the center of each strip of
  marzipan. Bring the long sides of each piece of marzipan up around
  the ganache and press marzipan together along the center top of the
  ganache, enclosing it. Don't worry if the marzipan doesn't cover
  perfectly or completely. Cut each roll into 3/4-inch lengths. Chill
  if necessary, then roll pieces into balls between the palms of your
  hands.
  
  Melt and temper the chocolate, and coat the truffles, then roll them
  in a pan of the chopped pistachios. Remove to a paper-lined pan and
  chill to set coating.
  
  Storage: Place truffles in a tin or plastic container with a
  tight-fitting cover and keep at cool room temperature for up to a
  week.

      Title: Chicken Baked In Clay
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  3 1/2 lb Chicken
      1    Sprig of fresh rosemary
      4    Fresh sage leaves
      2    Italian sweet sausage,
           Removed from casing
           Salt and freshly ground
           Black pepper
     20    Thin slices pancetta
      3 lb Box of non-toxic pottery
           Clay
 
  Start by washing the chicken inside and out, drying the bird well.
  Stuff the cavity of the bird with rosemary, sage, and sausage meat.
  Season the bird with the salt and pepper, wrap the breast of chicken
  with slices of pancetta. Carefully wrap the entire bird with a large
  piece of parchment paper, being sure the bird is securely enclosed
  and the paper has no holes.
  
  Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
  
  Roll the clay out between two pieces of plastic wrap, rolling out a
  circle large enough to cover the chicken, remove the plastic. Place
  the parchment wrapped bird in the center, breast side up and enclose
  the clay around the bird, completely sealing the chicken in the clay.
  Place the clay onto a baking sheet and place in the oven and bake for
  1 hour and 10 minutes. Cooking in the clay will seal all the juices
  and flavors.
  
  When cooked remove the chicken from the oven, bring to the tables and
  crack the clay open with a mallet or the blunt end of a knife. Peel
  off the clay and unwrap the bird, carve the chicken, serving the
  sausage meat with the chicken.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Milk
      2    Envelopes gelatin
      1 qt Heavy cream
    3/4 c  Sugar
      4    Lemon zests, stripped with a
           Vegetable peeler
    1/2    Vanilla bean
           Compote of Spring Fruit:
      1 pt Strawberries
      1    Basket raspberries
      4    Apricots
      3 tb Sugar
      1 tb Kirsch
 
  Have ready 8 molds or ramekins, 4 to 6 ounces each.
  
  To prepare the cream, pour the milk into a bowl, then sprinkle the
  gelatin on the surface, allow to stand so that the gelatin absorbs
  the milk and softens. Bring the cream to a boil with the sugar and
  the strips of lemon zest and split vanilla bean; remove from heat to
  steep so that it absorbs the lemon flavor. After 5 minutes, stir in
  the softened gelatin and return to a boil, stirring to dissolve the
  gelatin. Strain the mixture into a bowl, then fill the mold.
  Refrigerate it until set, at least 6 hours. Overnight is best.
  
  To unmold, dip the molds briefly in hot water. Loosen the top of the
  dessert by inserting the point of a sharp paring knife about 1/4 -
  inch between the cream and the mold, scraping it against the mold all
  around. Place a plate on the dessert and invert. Tap the mold at the
  top and lift it off. Refrigerate the dessert until it is served.
  
  For the compote, combine all ingredients and refrigerate several
  hours.
  
  To serve, remove desserts from refrigerator and surround with some of
  the compote and the Almond Wafers (recipe follows).

      1 c  Cold water
      2 tb Salt
      1 tb Ground black pepper
      2 tb Fennel seeds
    1/2 c  Grated pecorino romano
           Cheese
    1/2 c  Chopped parsley
    1/2 lb Hog sausage casing
 
  Trim the meat of all gristle but remember to not trim too much fat as
  the mixture should be approximately 80 percent lean to 20 percent
  fat. Cut the meat into chunks and pass through a meat grinder using
  the largest die. Pass the meat through again, this time using the
  medium die. Pass the sausage meat through one more time on this
  medium die.
  
  In a large bowl mix the ground meat with the water, salt, pepper,
  fennel seed, cheese and parsley.
  
  Wash the casing well under cold running water and allow water to run
  through the casing so that any holes may be detected. Fit the grinder
  with the sausage stuffing attachment and place the casing over the
  stuffing tube by feeding it on and bunching it up on the tube..
  
  Place the meat in the hopper on top and begin to push the sausage
  meat down into the hopper so that it begins to feed into the casing.
  As the meat feeds into the casing, allow the casing to slide into
  your open hand. Catch the stuffed sausage as it comes out of the
  machine. Go at a slow and steady pace so that the sausage is fully,
  evenly, stuffed and without air pockets. To make individual links,
  twist the sausage every few inches as it is stuffed and let the
  finished ring of sausage lay on the work space as you finish the
  process. Continue until the meat is finished. Keep refrigerated and
  use with in one week or freeze for later use.
  
  Yield: approximately 5 pounds finished sausage

           Egg Wash:
      1    Egg
      1    Egg yolk
        pn Salt
 
  For the dough, combine dry ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir well
  to mix. Add butter and rub in finely, making sure to leave the
  mixture cool and powdery. Whisk the eggs and stir into the mixture in
  the bowl. Continue stirring until the dough masses together. Scrape
  out onto a floured work surface and knead lightly until smooth. Wrap
  and chill.
  
  For the filling, rinse, hull and slice the strawberries. Rinse,
  string and cut the rhubarb into 2-inch lengths. Bring the sugar,
  water, orange juice and zest to a boil in a saucepan; add the
  strawberries and rhubarb and return to a simmer, stirring often. Be
  careful not to over cook. Drain well and reserve 1 cup of the liquid.
  Return the reserved liquid to a boil. Combine the liqueur and
  cornstarch smoothly and stir into the boiling liquid, continuing to
  stir and cook until clear and thickened. Allow to simmer 1 minute,
  stirring. Stir in the drained fruit and the butter. Chill while
  preparing top crust.
  
  Roll less than half the dough on a floured surface and fit it into a
  10 or 11-inch tart pan. Pour in the filling and spread evenly on the
  dough. Roll the remaining dough to a 12-inch disk and cut into
  1/2-inch strips. Flour a cookie sheet or cake cardboard and arrange
  half the strips on it horizontally, about 1/2-inch from each other.
  Weave in the other strips vertically, again about 1/2-inch from each
  other, to form a woven perpendicular lattice. Chill the lattice until
  firm.
  
  Whisk the egg, yolk and salt together until liquid. Remove tart and
  lattice from refrigerator. Paint lattice with egg wash and slide it
  onto the surface of the filling. Trim away extra dough at edge of
  pan, pressing the edges of the top crust well against the top edge of
  the bottom crust.
  
  Bake at 375 degrees on the bottom rack of the oven about 30 minutes,
  until well colored and gently bubbling. If top crust does not color
  sufficiently, place tart on top rack of oven for 5 minutes. Cool
  slightly and serve warm or at room temperature.

  30 minutes, or overnight.
  
  On a lightly floured surface pat the rested dough into a 10 by 4-inch
  rectangle. Roll the dough into a 14 by 9-inch rectangle.
  
  In a bowl with an electric mixer beat the butter with remaining 2
  tablespoons flour until it is pliable but still cold and firm. Between
  sheets of parchment or waxed paper roll the butter into a rectangle
  large enough to cover two-thirds of the dough with a one-inch border
  all around.
  
  Using parchment paper, invert butter onto the bottom two-thirds of the
  dough, leaving a 1-inch border all around. Fold the top-third of the
  dough down over the top half of the butter. Fold the bottom third up
  over the top (like a letter) and pinch edges to seal.
  
  Turn dough over, seam side down, give it one quarter turn and roll
  lengthwise into a 20 by 10-inch rectangle. Turn the dough over, seam
  side up, and fold like a letter. This is one turn. Chill dough,
  wrapped in plastic, for 30 minutes, or until firm.
  
  Arrange dough on lightly floured surface, with folded edge to your
  left, and roll lengthwise into a 20 by 10-inch rectangle. Fold and
  chill as before. Repeat process two more times, giving the dough four
  turns in all. After the fourth turn chill dough for at least 3 hours,
  or overnight.
  
  Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
  
  Form the croissants: On a lightly floured surface roll the dough into
  a 25 by 14 by 1/4-inch rectangle. Halve the dough lengthwise into two
  7-inch strips. Using a pastry wheel or a long chef's knife, cut the
  strips into triangles, each with a base of 4 to 5 inches. Beginning
  with the base of each triangle, fold 1/4-inch of the dough over onto
  itself and begin rolling the triangle up to the point. Gently stretch
  the dough by pulling on the tip as you roll it. Repeat with the
  remaining triangles. If dough becomes soft, chill. Transfer the
  croissants to the baking sheets as they are formed spacing them 2
  inches apart.
  
  Make the glaze: in a bowl whisk together the egg and milk. Brush the
  croissants with the glaze and let rise, uncovered, in a cool place
  (about 65 to 75 degrees) for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
  
  Let croissants rise in a warmer place (about 75 to 80 degrees) for 1
  1/2 hours more, or until almost doubled in size. Brush once more with
  the glaze and place on the center rack of a preheated 400 degree oven
  for 15 to 17 minutes, or until golden brown. Transfer to racks to
  cool.
  
  Yield: about 2 dozen

      Title: Strawberry Risotto
 Categories: Taste
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  Milk
      2 c  Coconut milk
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1    Vanilla bean, halved
           Lengthwise
      2    Strips lemon peel
      2 tb Butter
    2/3 c  Arborio rice
    1/2 c  Heavy cream or creme
           Fraiche
      1 c  Sliced strawberries
           Lightly-toasted sweetened
           Flaked coconut, for garnish
           Lightly-toasted sliced
           Almonds, for garnish
 
  In a saucepan combine milks, sugar, vanilla bean and lemon zest and
  heat until very hot and bubbles appear around edges of pan. Reduce
  heat and keep warm.
  
  Meanwhile, in another saucepan melt butter. When foaming subsides, add
  Arborio rice and stir to coat with butter. Add simmering milk, 1/2
  cup at a time, stirring vigorously. Let each addition be absorbed
  before adding more. Regulate heat so milk is absorbed at a brisk
  simmer. It should take from 30 to 35 minutes to add the liquid. Begin
  tasting toward the end of the cooking time -- the rice should be
  tender but still firm to the bite. It will form its own sauce.
  
  Stir in cream along with last addition of milk mixture and cook until
  partly absorbed. Remove from heat and stir in strawberries, saving a
  few perfect slices for garnishing. Serve in shallow bowls, sprinkled
  with coconut and almonds.

      Title: Quick Puff Pastry (Adapted From Julia Child)
 Categories: Taste
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 c  Unbleached, all-purpose
           Flour, plus extra for
           Rolling dough
      1 c  Bleached cake flour
  1 1/2 ts Salt
  6 1/2    Sticks (1 pound 10 ounces)
           Unsalted butter, each stick
           Cut into 16 to
     20 sm Pieces, chilled
           About 1 cup ice water
 
  On work surface, preferably a large marble board, measure out flours
  and salt and combine. Add chilled butter all at once, tossing to coat
  pieces in flour. Mixing rapidly with your hands, flatten butter into
  lima bean size pieces. Begin adding ice water, a few drops at a time,
  lifting and turning dough until it begins to come together. Using a
  dough scraper pat dough into a rough rectangle, 18-inches long and
  about 6-inches wide, with short side facing you. Dough will be messy
  and unmanageable. If butter softens too much during initial mixing,
  transfer entire work surface to refrigerator and chill.
  
  When dough has come together in a rough rectangle, fold bottom third
  up to middle, then fold top third over both layers, as if you were
  folding a letter. Scrape any excess dough to side and flour work
  surface well. Turn dough package 90 degrees to right, so top layer of
  dough could open like a book. Using a floured rolling pin, roll dough
  vertically into another 18x6-inch rectangle, with short side facing
  you. Fold again in thirds. Wrap dough in wax paper and refrigerate at
  least 20 minutes until dough is firm enough to roll again. Turn 90
  degrees to right. This is the second turn.
  
  Repeat rolling out, folding and turning 4 more times, refrigerating
  again after the 3rd and 5th turns; after 5th turn, chill at least 45
  minutes, if possible. Dough can be made ahead up to this point and
  refrigerated for 2 days, or frozen. After 6th turn, dough is ready to
  roll out into desired shape.
  
  Yield: About 2 3/4 pounds dough, enough to roll out to a 1/4-inch
  thick 12x36-inch rectangle

  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
  
  In a food processor combine almonds, sugar, flour, butter, lemon zest,
  vanilla and egg yolks; process to a coarse, granular texture. On a
  heavy parchment-lined baking sheet, spread almond mixture evenly over
  pastry circle. Using a melon baller, core pears. Slice 8 to 9 of the
  pears halves very thin horizontally, holding them to maintain their
  shape. Carefully lift and transfer halves to top of tart, arranging
  them to fit in a star pattern, narrow ends pointing in. Shape
  remaining pear half to fit in center of tart; score top, but do not
  slice through.
  
  Bake tart 40 to 45 minutes, until pears are golden brown and tender.
  Glaze pears liberally with hot apricot preserves and sprinkle
  pistachios in a line down each pear half for garnish.

  Yield 1/4 cup
  
  Mofongo: Heat a saute pan until quite hot. Now add some peanut oil
  and fry the plantain pieces until they are quite dark on all sides.
  Remove them to paper toweling to drain. Now place the cooked
  plantains in a bowl and mash in the foie gras and the butter. Season
  to taste.
  
  Heat the olive oil and butter in a large saucepan until the butter is
  foamy. Add the garlic and jalapenos. Stir. Now add the remaining
  vegetables and allow to caramelize. Now add the spices and stir. Add
  the Spanish Sherry wine vinegar and Sherry and stir again. Allow to
  reduce by half.
  
  Now add the beans and chicken stock. Bring to a boil and skim as
  necessary. Lower the heat so that its a high simmer until the beans
  are just cooked, (about 1 hour). Strain and reserve the beans in a
  bowl. Return the stock/bean broth mixture to the fire and cook down
  until almost syrupy. Pour it over the beans and reserve. Season to
  taste.

           Unbleached flour for

    1/3 c  Vegetable oil
      3 c  Diced onions
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      6 tb Tomato paste
    1/2 c  Red wine vinegar
      5 c  Hot water

      4 c  Crushed Italian plum
           Tomatoes
 
  Cut off lobster tails at body junctures and dredge exposed meat
  lightly in flour, shaking off excess.  In a large skillet, heat
  vegetable oil just short of smoking point, add lobster tails, meat
  side-down, and saute about 2 minutes, until golden brown.  Set tails
  aside.
  
  In a large non reactive saucepan or small stockpot, saute onions in
  1/3 cup of the olive oil until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add
  lobster shells, stir and cook 5 minutes.  Stir in tomato paste and
  cook over medium heat additional 5 minutes.  Blend vinegar with hot
  water, add to pan and bring to a full boil.  Add salt and tomatoes,
  bring to boil and cook 3 minutes. Remove lobster bodies with tongs,
  allowing all interior juices to drain back into sauce.  (Bodies
  should be reserved for other uses, or, if the meal is to be informal,
  may be served on a communal platter in the center of the table. The
  most delicate meat is in those bodies and should not be wasted.).
  
  Add claws, cook 7 minutes and add reserved tails and remaining olive

      4    Eggs, separated
    1/4 c  Water
      6 tb Superfine sugar
    1/2 c  Flour
           For the vanilla custard:
      1    Vanilla bean
      1 c  Milk
      3    Egg yolks
      2 tb Sugar
           For the syrup:
    1/4 c  Water
      1 tb Sugar
      2 tb Kirsch
           For the meringue:
      1 pt Water
      2 tb Milk
      3    Egg whites
    1/2 c  Sugar
           For the raspberry sauce:
      1 c  Raspberries (fresh or
           Frozen)
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 tb Raspberry liqueur
           For garnish:
      2 c  Fresh raspberries
 
  Make the biscuit: Whip egg yolks in an electric mixer with the water
  and half the sugar until doubled in volume. Whip egg whites in an
  electric mixer until soft peaks form, then slowly add the remaining
  sugar and whip until stiff peaks form. Fold yolks and whites
  together. Sift flour over the egg mixture and fold in. Do not
  overmix. Line a 9 by 9-inch baking pan with greaseproof paper, then
  grease the sides and the paper. Pour batter into the pan and bake in
  a preheated 350 degree oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Remove cake from
  oven. Allow to cool slightly and turn cake out onto a cooling rack.
  Cool completely. Cut the cake using a 3 1/2-inch cookie cutter into 4
  circles. Place them in the empty 9 by 9-inch pan until the syrup and
  vanilla custard are ready.
  
  Make the custard: Combine the vanilla bean and milk in a saucepan.
  Bring to a boil. In a stainless steel bowl, whisk egg yolks and sugar
  until light and fluffy. Pour boiling milk over egg yolks. Whisk
  together. Return to the sauce pan and simmer until thickened. Be
  careful not to overcook the mixture. While custard is still warm,
  pour over the biscuit circles.
  
  Make the syrup: Bring sugar and water to the boil. Add kirsch. Pour
  half over the biscuit circles. Reserve the other half.
  
  Make the meringue: Prepare a medium saucepan with water and the milk.
  Bring to the boil then reduce to a simmer. Whip egg whites in an
  electric mixer to soft peaks. Slowly add the sugar and continue
  whipping until stiff peaks are formed. Take two tablespoons and form
  spoonfuls of meringue into balls. Drop into the simmering liquid and
  poach the meringue for 4 minutes. Do not let mixture boil. Allow to
  cool on a paper towel. Make a total of 12 meringue balls.
  
  Make raspberry sauce: Puree the raspberries, sugar and liqueur. Add 1
  to 2 tablespoons reserved sugar syrup if necessary to correct
  consistency. Strain sauce.
  
  Assemble dessert: Place soaked biscuit in the center of a serving
  plate. Arrange beautifully the raspberries into a pyramidlike shape.
  Arrange 3 pieces poached meringue on the top of the raspberries.
  Drizzle the raspberries around the edge of the plate. Optional: bake
  biscuit in 4 individual savarin molds and fill with ice cream or
  sorbet and build raspberries around the outside.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      6 sl Home style white bread,
           About 3 1/2 by 3 1/2 -inches
           Square
      6    Bread size slices fresh
           Mozzarella, cut 1/4-inch
           Thick*
      1 c  All purpose flour
      1    Recipe Seasoned Egg batter,
           Recipe follows
      2 c  Bread Crumbs, recipe
           Follows
           Approximately 3 cups home
           Made or store bought
           Marinara sauce
           Approximately 6 cups
           Vegetable oil
      2 tb Chopped Italian parsley
 
  * Since fresh mozzarella is often sold in small ball shapes, you may
  need twelve 1/4-inch thick slices that you can then cut into
  triangles to fit bread.
  
  Preheat broiler.
  
  Trim crusts from bread. Put mozzarella slices on top of bread and
  trim to fit. Then cut bread and cheese on the diagonal into 2
  triangles of equal size. Dredge both sides of each piece of bread and
  cheese in flour. Shake off excess. Stack one piece of mozzarella onto
  each piece of bread. Set aside.
  
  Put Seasoned Egg Batter in a shallow bowl and Bread Crumbs into a
  second shallow bowl. Dip each set of bread and cheese into the
  Seasoned Egg Batter, then into Bread Crumbs, pressing lightly to coat
  well. Set aside, in a single layer, on a plate until ready to fry.
  
  Warm marinara sauce in a small, nonreactive saucepan on very low
  heat. Heat oil in a deep fat fryer to 350 degrees, or 1/2-inch
  vegetable oil in a heavy saute pan over high heat until hot but not
  smoking. Fry mozzarella and bread two at a time from approximately 1
  minute or until golden. Remove from oil and drain on paper towel. Put
  on a cookie sheet.
  
  When all pieces are fried and drained, broil on cookie sheet for 1
  minute. This will draw out excess oil and add extra crispness.
  
  Spoon 1/2 cup of warm marinara sauce onto each of 6 warm plates. Put 2
  mozzarella triangles in the center. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and
  serve.

      Title: Sausage And Potato Mini-Turnovers
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           For filling-
      1 lg Boiling potato (about 1/2
           Pound)
    1/2 lb Fresh Mexican chorizo (spicy
           Pork sausage)
      1 ts Dried oregano
           Salt to taste
           For dough:
      2 c  Masa harina*
  1 1/4 c  Warm water
           Vegetable oil for
           Deep-frying
 
  Accompaniments: Guacamole Tomato salsa
  
  *Note: available at Kitchen Market (888) 468-4433
  
  Make filling: Peel potato and cut into 1/4-inch dice. In a saucepan of
  boiling salted water steam potatoes 5 minutes, or until just cooked
  through, and drain in a colander.
  
  Remove casings from chorizo and crumble or finely chop meat. In a
  heavy skillet cook chorizo over moderate heat, stirring, 5 minutes.
  Add potato, oregano, and salt to taste and cook, stirring, 5 minutes.
  Cool filling completely. Filling may be made 2 days ahead and kept,
  covered and chilled, or frozen 2 weeks.
  
  Make dough: Line 2 baking sheets with plastic wrap. In a large bowl
  stir together masa harina and warm water until a dough forms. Pinch
  off small pieces of dough and shape into about forty 1-inch balls.
  Transfer balls to a baking sheet and cover with more plastic wrap.
  
  From a plastic bag cut two 5-inch squares and use one to line lower
  half of a tortilla press. Put a ball of dough in tortilla press and
  top with second square of plastic. Close tortilla press, pushing
  gently on lever to flatten dough just to a 2 1/2-inch round.
  (Alternatively, flatten dough between squares of plastic using a
  rolling pin.) Remove top plastic square and put a rounded teaspoon
  filling in center of round. Fold round over filling to form a half
  moon, using plastic underneath to support dough if necessary, and
  pinch edges together to seal. Transfer turnover to other baking
  sheet. Make more turnovers in same manner, reusing plastic squares,
  and put on baking sheets. Turnovers may be prepared up to this point
  and kept, covered with plastic wrap, chilled 1 day or frozen 1 week.
  Thaw turnovers 1 hour before proceeding.
  
  In a large saucepan heat 1-inch oil until it registers 375 degrees on
  a deep-fat thermometer and fry turnovers in batches of 8 to 10 until
  golden, 2 to 3 minutes, transferring with a slotted spoon to paper
  towels to drain and making sure oil returns to 375 degrees before
  adding next batch.
  
  Serve turnovers immediately with guacamole or salsa.

      Title: Potato Crusted Chicken With Olives And Red Wine
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lg Russet potatoes, about 1
           Pound
      4 tb Olive oil
      3 tb Unsalted butter
      4    Chicken breasts, skin off
           And boneless, about 1 pound
           Salt and pepper
      3 tb Chopped shallots
    1/4 c  Pitted Greek Calamata olives
           Coarsely chopped
    1/4 c  Dry red wine with dark rich
           Color (such as Syrah)
    1/2 c  Chicken stock
      6    To 8 basil leaves, washed
           And julienned
 
  Preheat an oven to 425 degrees.
  
  Wash and peel the potatoes. Fill a bowl with cold water and slice the
  potatoes into paper thin slices on an Asian vegetable slicer or on
  the wide slicer of a cheese grater. Put the cut potato into the ice
  water and set aside.
  
  Heat 1 tablespoon each of oil and butter in a large saute pan. Season
  the chicken breasts with salt and pepper and add to the hot pan.
  Brown the chicken to a light golden color over moderately high heat.
  Turn the chicken to brown the second side, then remove the breasts
  from the pan, place in an oven proof dish and set aside.
  
  Add the shallots to the hot pan and saute for 1 minute. Stir the
  olives into the shallots, add the wine, and cook for 1 minute before
  adding the chicken stock. Cook for 1 minute and then turn off the
  heat.
  
  Drain the potatoes and dry on paper towels. Toss the potatoes in a
  bowl, with the remaining olive oil, making sure they are evenly
  coated, and season with salt and pepper. Wrap each chicken breast
  completely in sliced potato. Overlap the slices across the width of
  the chicken. Place the potato wrapped chicken into the oven and roast
  for 12 to 14 minutes or until the potato has cooked to a crisp golden
  brown and the chicken is fully cooked but still moist.
  
  As the chicken finishes cooking, reheat the sauce, cook for 6 to 7
  minutes then add the basil.
  
  Swirl in the remaining butter and spoon around the chicken.
  
  Serve with fried spinach leaves.

      Title: Poached Pears With Marscapone And Espresso Sauce
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 c  Water
    1/2 c  White wine
    1/2 c  Good Port wine
      4 tb Sugar
      1    Cinnamon stick
      2    To 3 whole cloves
      4    Firm Bartlett pears
      1 c  Italian marscapone cheese,
           Or other fresh, sweet, cow's
           Milk cheese
      2 tb Clover honey
    1/4 ts Vanilla
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
      2 tb Poppy seeds for garnish
      2 tb Dried cherries
 
  Bring the water, wines, sugar, and spices to a boil in a pot just
  large enough to hold the pears. Lower the heat and simmer for 5
  minutes. While the poaching liquid is cooking, peel but do not core
  the pears (use a vegetable peeler for the neatest job with the least
  waste).
  
  Poach the pears, uncovered, for 20 minutes, or until they are just
  tender to the tip of a knife. Remove from the heat and cool the pears
  in the liquid for another 20 minutes. You can then refrigerate them
  (still in the liquid) for later use.
  
  In a stainless steel bowl, combine the marscapone, honey, vanilla,
  cinnamon, and nutmeg and whisk to form a smooth creamy filling. Place
  the cheese filling into a clean pastry bag fitted with a star tip.
  
  Remove the pears from the liquid, drain and dry them. Cut the pears
  in half lengthwise, and remove the core with a teaspoon, making a
  neat opening for the marscapone filling. Slice a sliver off the round
  side of the pear to steady it on the plate.
  
  Pipe a neat star-shaped dollop into the pear, place it in a serving
  dish, pour some espresso sauce around it and garnish with poppy seeds
  and dried cherries.
  
  Yield: 4 full and 8 small portions.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 c  Water
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
    1/2 c  Good port wine
      2 tb Granulated sugar
      1    Cinnamon stick
      2    Or 3 whole cloves
    1/4 ts Red pepper flakes
      4    Firm Bartlett pears
           For the garnish:
    1/2 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
    1/4 c  Balsamic vinegar
    1/4 lb Gorgonzola cheese or other
           Blue cheese
    1/2 lb Mesclun or your choice of
           Fresh young salad greens
    1/2 lb Thinly sliced prosciutto,
           Westphalian, or real
           Virginia ham,
           Properly cooked and cooled
 
  Bring the water, wine, sugar, and spices to a boil in a pot just large
  enough to hold the pears. Lower the heat and simmer 5 minutes.
  
  While the poaching liquid is cooking, peel, but do not core, the
  pears. (Use a vegetable peeler for the neatest job with the least
  waste.)
  
  Poach the pears, uncovered, 20 minutes, or until they are just tender
  to the tip of a knife. Remove from the heat, and cool the pears in
  the liquid another 20 minutes. You can refrigerate them (still in the
  liquid) for later use. When ready to serve, remove the pears from the
  liquid, cut in half lengthwise, and remove the core with a teaspoon.
  With a sharp knife, slice each pear half into 1/4-inch thick
  lengthwise slices, leaving the neck of the pear unsliced so that you
  can "fan" the pear half on its serving plate.
  
  Make the garnish by combining the oil and vinegar in a bowl with the
  crumbled
  
  Gorgonzola. Add the mesclun and toss.
  
  On each serving plate, place a pear half at the 6 o'clock position,
  "fanning" it across the plate. Divide the prosciutto into 8 portions
  and drape one portion across the middle of each serving plate,
  covering the top half of the pear fan. Garnish each plate with 1/4
  cup dressed greens, placed in the 12 o'clock position, above the
  prosciutto.

      Title: Apple Skillet Cake With Port And Currant Jelly
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2    Eggs
      1 c  Whole milk
      6 tb Unsalted butter
      1 c  Unbleached white flour
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 c  Granulated sugar
      1 tb Orange zest
      1 ts Lemon zest
      6    Winesap, Macoun, Empire
           Apples or other tart apples,
           About 1 3/4 pounds
      2 tb Unsalted butter
    1/3 c  Maple syrup
    1/4 c  Port wine
      1 tb Cinnamon
      1 ts Lemon juice
           Currant jelly
           English double clotted
           Cream
 
  To make the skillet cake batter, whisk together the eggs, milk and 2
  tablespoons butter, melted. Mix the flour, baking powder, sugar, and
  zest. Combine the flour with the liquids and allow batter to rest,
  refrigerated, for at least 30 minutes before cooking.
  
  Peel, core, and cut the apples into 1/2-inch thick slices. In a
  separate pan, melt 2 tablespoons butter, add the apple slices and
  saute over medium heat until they turn a rich golden color, about 5
  minutes. Reduce the heat to low and carefully add the maple syrup,
  Port, cinnamon, and lemon juice. Cook slowly until the apples are
  tender at the center of each slice, but not soft and mushy, about 2
  minutes.
  
  Heat a non-stick 7-inch omelet pan over low heat until hot. Add 1 or 2
  teaspoons of butter, melted, using either a brush or a tiny ladle, to
  coat the surface lightly. As soon as the butter has started to
  bubble, lift the pan off the heat and pour 1/2 cup of batter into the
  pan, tilting to spread the batter evenly across the bottom. Return
  the pan to heat, spoon in 1/4 of the apples and cook on low until
  golden on the underside. When the top is bubbly, flip and brown the
  second side.
  
  As each pancake is completed, place on an oven-proof platter set in a
  200 degree oven. There should be enough batter to make at least 4
  skillet cakes.
  
  Serve each cake warm with a dollop of currant jelly and some clotted
  cream or creme fraiche.
  
  Yield: 4 to 6 cakes

      Title: "21" Apple Pie
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Pie dough-
      2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
      6 oz Cold, unsalted butter, cut
           Into cubes, plus butter for
           The pie tin
    1/4    To 1/3 cup ice cold water
           Filling-
      1    Stick (8 tablespoons)
           Unsalted butter
     12 lg Apples such as Granny Smith,
           Peeled, cored, and sliced
           Into
           Eighths (about 14 cups)
           Juice of 2 lemons (about 1/4
           Cup)
    1/4 c  Loosely packed dark brown
           Sugar
    1/4 c  Southern Comfort
      1 tb Ground cinnamon
           Egg wash:
      1 lg Egg beaten with 2
           TB water
 
  To prepare the dough by hand, combine the flour and salt in a
  stainless steel bowl and mix well.
  
  Add the cold butter cubes and, with a pastry blender, blend in the
  butter until the mixture begins to resemble a mealy mixture where
  butter forms peas-size nuggets plainly visible in the flour. Add only
  enough water to pull the dough together. The water should be added to
  the flour slowly to ensure that only the minimum amount of water is
  used. Do not over-mix the dough. When the dough has been mixed just
  sufficiently to combine the ingredients, form it into a ball and wrap
  in a piece of plastic wrap and refrigerate for several hours.
  
  To prepare the filling, melt the butter in a large saute pan until it
  begins to brown. Add the sliced apples and cook over medium heat
  until they begin to soften, about 2 to 3 minutes.
  
  In a bowl, combine the lemon juice, sugars, Southern Comfort, and
  cinnamon. Add this mixture to the apples and cook 2 to 3 minutes over
  medium-high heat until the apples are completely caramelized and
  covered with all the sugar. Remove filling from the heal and allow to
  cool.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
  
  When ready to use, remove the dough from the refrigerator, lightly
  flour a pastry board and a rolling pin, and unwrap the dough. Divide
  the dough into 2 equal pieces and begin to roll out
  
  into a circle by rolling evenly outward from the center and turning
  the dough in small 1/8th turns to keep the rolling even. When the
  dough is rolled out to an even thickness and is about 12 inches in
  diameter and 1/8-inch thick, it is ready to be transferred to a
  10-inch pie tin. Lightly butter the tin, partially roll the dough up
  on the rolling pin, lift the dough and center it in the pie tin and
  unroll.
  
  Roll the second half of the pie dough into a round slightly larger
  than the pie pan. Fill the bottom crust with the cooked apples using
  a slotted spoon to drain the apples. Reserve juices if desired, for
  sauce. Brush an egg wash coating over the lip of the dough. This is
  where it will be sealed to the top crust. Cover the apples with the
  top half of the pie dough. Trim any excess from the top crust before
  using both hands to crimp the edges of the two crust together to
  seal. With a sharp knife, make several crosshatch slits in the top
  crust. Brush with the egg wash and bake for 35 to 40 minutes. Remove
  from the oven and cool 20 minutes. Serve with vanilla ice cream.
  
  Reserved juices can be reduced with heavy cream for a sauce for the
  pie.

      Title: Chili Rubbed Pork Tenderloin
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Marinade-
      2 tb Chili paste
    1/2 c  Orange juice
           Juice of 1 lemon
      3 tb Honey
      3 tb Brown sugar
      2 tb Tomato ketchup
      1 ts Ground cumin
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
      3 tb Mango chutney finely
           Chopped
      2 lb Pork tenderloin
 
  Combine all of the marinade ingredients in a container large enough to
  accommodate the pork tenderloin strips. Add the pork, turning to cover
  completely with the marinade, and marinate in the refrigerator
  overnight, or for at least several hours before cooking.
  
  The pork is particularly delicious marinated overnight and grilled on
  an outdoor barbecue grill. In a pinch, it can be broiled in a hot oven
  broiler, or roasted in a 375 degree oven. In any case, each
  tenderloin is small, so they should cook in no more than 15 to 20
  minutes.
  
  If grilling outdoors, prepare a barbecue with white-hot coals. Remove
  the pork from the marinade, letting the excess drip back into the
  container. Season each tenderloin lightly with salt and pepper. Brush
  the grill with cooking oil. Lay the pork on the grill and cook,
  turning frequently to avoid burning. Before removing it from the
  grill, broiler, or oven, use a meat thermometer to check that the
  pork has reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees.
  
  Put the remaining marinade in a sauce pan with 1/2 cup water and
  bring to the boil, reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. When the
  tenderloin is done, slice and serve together with the hot marinade.

           Steaks, at least 3/4 inch
           Thick
      2 lg Vidalia onions, peeled and
           Sliced 1/4 inch thick
           Slices
      2    Sweet red peppers, seeded
           And sliced into rings
      2    Sweet yellow peppers, seeded
           And sliced into rings
     12 lg Shiitake mushroom caps
      2 tb Olive oil
           Salt and pepper
 
  For the marinade: Combine all ingredients in the bowl of a food
  processor and pulse to combine. Use to marinate swordfish, salmon,
  tuna, or red snapper overnight. For the vinaigrette: Combine the
  vinegar and mustard in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse briefly,
  then add the herbs. Pulse again until coarsely chopped. With the
  processor running, add the olive oil very slowly so that the mixture
  will emulsify into a smooth blend. Season with salt and freshly
  ground pepper to taste. This dressing will keep for up to 10 days in
  the refrigerator. For the swordfish: The night before, rub the
  swordfish steaks with the marinade. Cover and marinate, refrigerated,
  overnight. The next day, prepare an outdoor grill for cooking. Right
  before grilling, toss the onions, peppers and mushrooms with the
  olive oil, salt and pepper. When the grill is hot, grill the
  swordfish until it is well colored on both sides and the interior is
  medium (about 3 to 4 minutes per side, total).When you have added the
  fish to the grill, spread the vegetables along the perimeter of the
  grill and carefully cook the vegetables without burning. Remove the
  fish from the grill, plate, drizzle with vinaigrette over the fish,
  top with vegetables and serve.

      3 lb Seaweed
      2    Dozen little neck clams
      3 lb New potatoes
      8    Ears corn
      2 lb Small white onions
      2 lb Chorizo sausage
      3 lb Mussels
      6    (1 pound) lobsters
           Drawn butter
           Cayenne pepper
           Coarse salt
           Lemons
           Hot sauce
      1 lg Enamel lobster pot
           Preferably 24 quart size
           Cheesecloth
 
  Wash the shellfish in fresh water. Wash the potatoes, peel (but leave
  whole) the onions, pull back the husk from the corn, remove the silk
  and wrap the corn again in husks. Wrap each food item separately into
  a small bundle of cheesecloth so that it can more easily be retrieved
  from the hot and steamy pot.
  
  Put the lobster pot on the stove, line the bottom with a layer of
  seaweed and pour in 2 cups water. Place the bundle of clams and
  potatoes on this first layer of seaweed. Place a layer of seaweed
  over the first 2 cheesecloth bundles. Lay the bundles of corn and
  clams on the seaweed layer and top them with yet another seaweed
  layer. Put the sausage and mussel packages into the pot and layer
  some seaweed over them. End with a layer of lobster, neatly tucked
  into the pot and covered with seaweed. If the lobstesr rise above the
  top edge of the pot, cover them with a towel, tucking the edges into
  the rim of the pot. Set the heat on medium and begin cooking the
  lobster bake. When the lobster have cooked completely, about 45 to 60
  minutes, the other ingredients of the bake should be cooked as well.
  Serve the bake with all the condiments on the side along with hot
  cornbread.

      1 lb Fresh, ripe peaches
      1 c  Sugar
      1 tb Cinnamon
      2 tb Orange liquor
      2 c  Sifted allpurpose flour
      3 tb Granulated sugar
      2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Buttermilk
    1/2 c  Heavy cream, plus 1 cup for
           Whipping
      6 tb Cold unsalted butter, cut
           Into small pieces
      1 c  Heavy cream
      2 tb Confectioners sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
  
  Wash the fruit and cut the plums in half and slice the peaches.
  Remove the pit or stones from all the fruit. Combine the fruit in a
  bowl with the sugar, cinnamon and orange liquor and pour into a large
  3 to 4 quart casserole or souffle dish.
  
  In a mixing bowl combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
  After the dry ingredients are thoroughly blended, add the buttermilk,
  1/2 cup heavy cream, and cold butter in quick succession, combining
  only briefly, to leave the mixture as lumpy as possible.
  
  Pour this lumpy dough onto a lightly floured board and flatten gently
  with a rolling pin into a shape approximately 1-inch thick and just
  large enough to cover the top of the fruit in the dish completely.
  Top the fruit with the dough and pull the edges towards the dish so
  that the fruit is enclosed. Brush the dough with melted butter,
  sprinkle the top with sugar and place the casserole into the oven and
  bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the pastry top is nicely browned.
  
  Whip the heavy cream with confectioners sugar and vanilla and serve
  with the cobbler.

 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 lb Store-bought puff pastry
      1 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
           Cheese
      1 ts Sweet paprika
      1    Egg mixed with 1 teaspoon
           Water
 
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
  
  Roll the dough into a rectangle about 1/4-inch thick. Brush with some
  of the egg wash and sprinkle with half of the Parmesan and paprika.
  Gently run the rolling pin over the dough to press the cheese mixture
  into it. Turn the dough over, brush it again with egg wash and
  sprinkle with remaining cheese and paprika. Again, gently run the
  rolling pin over the dough to press the cheese into it. Transfer the
  dough to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and chill for at
  least 30 minutes.
  
  Line a baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper that does not
  extend all the way to the end, leaving about 1 inch of baking sheet
  uncovered. With a pastry wheel or sharp knife, cut the dough
  lengthwise into 1/2-inch strips. Twist the strips corkscrew fashion
  and arrange 1/2 inch apart on the parchment lined baking sheet. Press
  the ends of the strips onto the bare baking sheet at each end so they
  stick and hold the dough stretched and in place.
  
  Bake in the oven for 10 minutes, or until puffed and golden. Cut
  crosswise into 4-inch lengths while hot and let cool on racks.
  
  Yield: about 75 hors d'oeuvres.
  
  Note: Straws may be stored in air-tight containers for 1 to 2 days.
  Keep in a cool, dry place. Crisp in the oven before serving.

           Pasta-
      3    Jumbo eggs
      1 c  Roasted beets in cubes (see
           Recipe above), pulse in food
           Processor
           Until smooth
      4 c  All-purpose unbleached
           Flour
 
  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, toss beets with oil and salt to coat. Place on
  lined baking sheet and place in 400 degree oven for 1 hour. Remove and
  allow to cool (about 20 minutes). Peel beets under running water and
  cut into 1/4-inch dice.
  
  To prepare roasted beet pasta:
  
  Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting
  board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, beet
  puree and any other flavoring you choose. Using a fork, beat together
  the eggs, oil and flavorings and begin to incorporate the flour
  starting with the inner rim of the well. As you expand the well, keep
  pushing the flour up to retain the well shape. Do not worry that this
  initial phase looks messy. The dough will come together when 1/2 of
  the flour is incorporated.
  
  Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your
  hands primarily. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from
  the board and scrape up any left over crusty bits. Lightly flour the
  board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough should be
  elastic and a little sticky. Continue to knead for another 3 minutes,
  remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the dough in
  plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Note:
  do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe, they are
  essential for a light pasta. Roll out to four 7-inch by 16-inch
  sheets.

    3/4 c  Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
           Plus 1/2 cup
    1/2 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
    1/4 c  Milk
      1    Egg
           Pasta:
      1    Recipe basic pasta
      2 c  Basic chicken broth
 
  To make marmalade:
  
  Place chopped red onions, Lambrusco, orange juice and sugar in a
  saucepan and place over medium high heat. Bring to a boil, lower heat
  to medium and reduce until thick like marmalade, about 30 minutes.
  Remove from heat and allow to cool.
  
  To make filling:
  
  In a 12- to 14-inch saute pan, melt butter over medium heat until just
  starting to foam. Slice raw chicken very thinly across the grain and
  place in pan with butter. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly,
  until very lightly browned. Add wine, cover and cook for 5 minutes.
  Remove cover and cook until liquid is gone, 2 to 3 more minutes.
  Remove from heat and allow to cool. Cut prosciutto and mortadella
  into 1/4-inch dice and place in food processor. Add cooled contents
  of sauté pan and pulse until just ground, like meat, not like a
  mousse. Pour into a large mixing bowl and add cheese, nutmeg, milk
  and egg, folding carefully. Check for seasoning with salt only and
  refrigerate.
  
  Fresh Egg Pasta
  
  4 extra large eggs 3 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour plus 1/2
  cup
      1/2    teaspoon olive oil
  
  Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting
  board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, oil
  and any other flavoring you choose. Using a fork, beat together the
  eggs, oil and flavorings and begin to incorporate the flour starting
  with the inner rim of the well. As you expand the well, keep pushing
  the flour up to retain the well shape. Do not worry that this initial
  phase looks messy. The dough will come together when 1/2 of the flour
  is incorporated.
  
  Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your
  hands primarily. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from
  the board and scrape up any left over crusty bits. Lightly flour the
  board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough should be
  elastic and a little sticky. Continue to knead for another 3 minutes,
  remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the dough in
  plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Note:
  do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe, they are
  essential for a light pasta.
  
  Yield: 1 pound
  
  To assemble tortellini:
  
  Lay out 1 sheet of pasta and cut into 2-inch rounds using a water
  glass or cookie cutter. Cover cut rounds with a damp kitchen towel so
  that they do not dry out. Working 5 at a time, place 1/2 teaspoon
  filling in center of each round. Fold each round in half to form a
  half moon and pinch the edges tightly together to seal. Take the two
  opposing corners and bring the tails of the half moon together,
  twisting one half turn so that the sealed half round edge curves
  around the outside of the filled soul of the tortellini. Repeat with
  each round until all pasta is used up. Leave formed pasta shapes
  uncovered to dry.
  
  To serve, heat the chicken stock to boil in a large pasta pot and add
  onion marmalade. Check broth for seasoning with salt. Drop 48
  tortellini into broth and return to boil. Lower heat until just under
  boil and cook tortellini until tender and yet still possessing a
  discernible resistance to the bite, about 4 to 6 minutes. Spoon 12
  tortellini into each of 4 warm soup bowls and divide the broth among
  them. Sprinkle with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and serve immediately.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
 15 1/2 c  All-purpose flour plus 1/2
        c  For dusting work surface
      8    Egg yolks, jumbo
      1 tb Virgin olive oil
      1 ts Salt
 
  Use standard well technique, placing yolks only in initial well.
  
  Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting
  board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, oil
  and any other flavoring you choose. Using a fork, beat together the
  eggs, oil and flavorings and begin to incorporate the flour starting
  with the inner rim of the well. As you expand the well, keep pushing
  the flour up to retain the well shape. Do not worry that this initial
  phase looks messy. The dough will come together when 1/2 of the flour
  is incorporated.
  
  Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your
  hands primarily. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from
  the board and scrape up any left over crusty bits. Lightly flour the
  board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough should be
  elastic and a little sticky. Continue to knead for another 3 minutes,
  remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the dough in
  plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Note:
  do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe, they are
  essential for a light pasta.

  FRESH EGG PASTA
  
  3 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour plus 1/2 cup 4 extra large
  eggs
      1/2    teaspoon olive oil
  
  Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting
  board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs, oil
  and any other flavoring you choose. Using a fork, beat together the
  eggs, oil and flavorings and begin to incorporate the flour starting
  with the inner rim of the well. As you expand the well, keep pushing
  the flour up to retain the well shape. Do not worry that this initial
  phase looks messy. The dough will come together when 1/2 of the flour
  is incorporated.
  
  Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your
  hands primarily. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from
  the board and scrape up any left over crusty bits. Lightly flour the
  board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough should be
  elastic and a little sticky. Continue to knead for another 3 minutes,
  remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the dough in
  plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Note:
  do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe, they are
  essential for a light pasta.

  mix them with strips of beef fat (describe "braiding" technique).
  Season well with salt and pepper.
  
  In a meat grinder, grind together the boneless meats through a large
  grinding blade (with holes of 3/8-inch). Grind again. Loosely shape
  into 12 hamburgers.
  
  If cooking indoors, heat a large, heavy skillet over high heat. Add 2
  ounces of beef suet and let it melt. Add six burgers to the skillet
  if they fit without crowding. Cook about 4 minutes on each side for
  rare burgers, or longer if desired. Repeat in the same beef suet with
  the remaining six burgers.
  
  Yield: 12 hamburgers
  
  24 ounces meat from chuck neck bones (you will need about 6 lbs of
  bones)

      Title: Tamales With Chicken And Salsa Verde
 Categories: Taste
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           For the tamale-
    1/2    Eight-ounce package dried
           Corn husks
      4 oz (1/2 cup) lard
      1 lb (2 cups) fresh masa
    2/3 c  Poultry broth
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Salt
           For the salsa verde:
      1 lb Tomatillos
      3    Serrano chiles
           Salt
      1 tb Lard
      6    Sprigs fresh coriander,
           Roughly chopped
      1 sm Onion, chopped
      1 lg Clove garlic, chopped
      3    Tomatillos, chopped
    1/4 c  Cilantro, chopped
  1 1/3 c  Shredded chicken
 
  Prepare cornhusks:
  
  Simmer the husks in water to cover for 10 minutes, weighting them
  with a plate to keep them submerged. Let them stand for a couple of
  hours until husks are pliable.
  
  To make the dough:
  
  Beat the lard in a mixer until very light, for about a minute. Add 1/2
  pound (1 cup) fresh masa to lard. Beat until well blended. Continue
  beating, adding alternately the remaining 1/2 pound masa and the
  poultry broth, adding only enough broth to give consistency of medium
  thick cake batter. Then sprinkle in the baking powder and salt. Beat
  1 minute more.
  
  To make the salsa:
  
  Husk and wash the tomatillos. Put the tomatillos and 3 Serrano chiles
  and some salt in a pot of water and boil them until tender, about 10
  to 15 minutes. Then drain them and put them in the bowl of a food
  processor. Add the coriander, onion, and garlic. Process until smooth.
  
  Heat 1 tablespoon lard in a medium large skillet over medium high
  heat. When the lard is hot enough to make a drop of the tomatillo
  puree sizzle, pour it all in at once. Stir the sauce constantly for
  45 minutes until it gets darker and thicker...thick enough to coat a
  spoon. Add the chopped tomatillos and cilantro. Season with salt.
  
  Mix the shredded chicken with 1/2 cup cooked tomatillo sauce.
  
  To form the tamales:
  
  Remove husks from water when they have softened. Pat husks dry. Tear
  extra husks into 1/4 inch wide, 7 inch long strips one for each
  tamale. Take one that is at least 6 inches across on wider end and 67
  inches long. Lay out this cornhusk with tapering end toward you.
  Spread a couple of tablespoons of dough mixture into a square,
  leaving at least a 1 1/2inch border on side toward you and 3/4 inch
  border along other sides. Pick up two long sides of cornhusk and
  bring them together, overlapping one over the other. Fold up the
  bottom section of husk tightly right up to the filling line. Leave
  top open. Secure it in place by loosely tying one of strips of husk
  around tamale. Repeat with remaining husks and dough mixture.
  
  Stand tamales on the folded bottom in prepared steamer, being sure
  they are not packed too closely in steamer they need to expand. Cover
  with layer of leftover husks. Cover with lid and steam for 1 hour.
  Check carefully that all the water doesn't boil away, adding boiling
  water when necessary.
  
  Serve with additional salsa on the side.

           Almond Praline:
      1 c  Sugar
      1 c  Water
      2 c  Sliced almonds
           Mousse Filling:
      8 oz Semisweet chocolate, broken
           Into small chunks
      2 oz Bitter chocolate, broken
           Into small chunks
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
      3 c  Whipping cream
           Chunk of semisweet chocolate
           For making the curls
 
  To make the sour cream cake: butter and flour an 8 or 9 inch cake pan
  and set aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Sift together the
  cake flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt and set aside. In a
  large bowl, cream the butter with the sugar until light and fluffy,
  then beat in the egg yolks and the vanilla. In a measuring jug, whisk
  the sour cream and the milk together until smooth. Add the dry
  ingredients and the sour cream mixture alternately to the creamed
  butter mixture, ending with the milk mixture. Fold in the egg whites,
  then pour into the prepared pan. Bake on the center rack of the oven
  for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center
  comes out clean. Cool on a rack for 5 minutes, then unmold onto a
  plate and continue cooling to room temperature. Wrap with plastic
  wrap and refrigerate until you are ready to finish the cake.
  
  To make the almond praline: preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a
  small saucepan, combine the sugar and the water over low heat. Stir
  together until the sugar has melted, then increase the heat to high
  and bring the mixture to a boil. Boil for 1 minute, then remove from
  the heat. In a mixing bowl, combine the sliced almonds with the sugar
  syrup and toss until well coated. With a slotted spoon, transfer the
  nuts to a lightly oiled baking sheet and bake until golden, about 10
  to 15 minutes. Let the nuts cool and break them apart. The nuts
  should remain whole but be coated with a sugary golden coating.
  
  To make the chocolate mousse: chill a bowl and the beaters of an
  electric mixer in the freezer for 1 hour. Meanwhile, in a double
  boiler, melt the chocolates over simmering water and stir in the
  cinnamon. In the frozen mixing bowl, whip the cream to soft peaks (do
  not overbeat). Remove the double boiler insert holding the melted
  chocolate from the pan. With a rubber spatula, fold 1/4 of the
  whipped cream into the chocolate. Fold the remaining cold cream into
  the chocolate mixture, 1/4 at a time, mixing it as little as possible
  just to get it all incorporated.
  
  When ready to assemble the torte, cut the sour cream cake in half
  horizontally with a long sharp knife. Place 1 layer of the cake on a
  serving plate and spread a thick layer of mousse on top of it.
  Sandwich the second layer over the top and spread a mounded layer of
  mouse over the top. Spread a layer of mousse around the edges,
  covering the cake completely. Gently press the sugared almonds into
  the mousse evenly around the edges of the cake. Using a very sharp
  vegetable peeler, shave long thick curls of chocolate over the top of
  the cake and serve immediately.

  In a food processor combine the flour, butter, sugar and salt and
  process until mixture resembles coarse meal. With the motor running
  add the egg mixture and pulse just until dough is formed. Wrap in
  plastic wrap and chill 30 minutes.
  
  On a lightly floured surface roll out the dough into a round 1/8 inch
  thick and fit it into a 10 inch tart pan, pressing edge to 1/2-inch
  above the rim. Chill until ready to use.
  
  Make the filling.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Using an electric mixer beat the egg yolks until combined. Add 1/2 cup
  sugar a little at a time and beat until lemon colored.
  
  Pass the ricotta through a fine sieve into a bowl. Add the ricotta,
  potato starch, lemon rind and vanilla to the egg mixture and beat
  until just combined.
  
  In another bowl with an electric mixer beat the egg whites until they
  form soft peaks. Add the remaining sugar a little at a time and beat
  until firm. Stir 1/4 of the whites into the batter and fold in the
  remaining whites gently but thoroughly.
  
  Pour mixture into chilled tart shell, place on a baking sheet and
  bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until golden brown and set. Let cool to

      Title: Cheese Straws (Taste)
 Categories: Taste
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 3/4 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Cake flour
  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/4    To 1/2 teaspoon cayenne
           Pepper, depending on how hot
           You want straws
    1/2 lb Unsalted butter, cold, cut
           In small pieces
      1 c  Packed, grated white aged
           Cheddar cheese
    1/2 c  Grated, good quality
           Parmesan cheese
    1/2 c  Packed, grated, yellow
           Cheddar cheese
      6    To 8 tablespoons ice water
 
  Mix flours, salt, and cayenne pepper together. With the tips of your
  fingers, work cold butter quickly into the flour mixture until the
  butter is the size of peas. Add all cheeses and toss together.
  Sprinkle the water in by the tablespoon while tossing the flour
  cheese mixture with your other hand. As soon as the dough begins to
  form a mixture that sticks together, gently press it out on a lightly
  floured board in a rectangle about 10 to 12 inches long by 5 to 6
  inches wide. Roll quickly with a rolling pin, so the dough is a solid
  piece. It will look rough at this point, but will smooth out later.
  
  Fold 1/3 of the dough towards you from the top and 1/3 of the dough
  away from you towards the top. The dough will break along the folds;
  don't worry about it. Turn the dough block sideways so it looks like
  a book. Roll the dough a second time and fold again. Rest the dough
  in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Roll and fold the dough twice
  more. Rest it in the refrigerator for 1 hour. At this point, the
  dough may be frozen in one or two pieces or rolled to make cheese
  straws.
  
  To roll dough to make cheese straws, cut dough in half, keeping one
  half chilled. On a lightly floured board, roll dough about 1/8-inch
  thick in a rectangle about 8 to 9 inches wide. Trim the edges (but
  bake the trimmings for a snack). With a sharp knife, cut the straws
  1/2-inch wide and lay them on a well greased baking sheet. Bake at
  350 degrees for about 10 minutes until a light brown. They will crisp
  as they cool. The straws are fragile, so handle them carefully and
  eat them soon.

 Categories: Emeril
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      6 lb (12 medium) cucumbers, cut
           Into 1/2-inch slices
      1 c  Thinly sliced onions
      1 c  Kosher salt for soaking
           Brine:
      3 c  White vinegar
      1 c  Water
      2 c  Sugar
     20    Cloves garlic
      1 tb Black peppercorns
     10    Whole allspice
      2 ts Whole mustard seed
 
  Slice and soak the cucumbers and onions for 1 hour in 1 cup salt and
  enough cold water to cover.
  
  Make brine: Combine vinegar, water, sugar, garlic, peppercorns,
  allspice and mustard seeds. Bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes.
  Drain the cucumbers and onions but don't rinse. Pour the hot brine
  over the cukes and onions and allow to sit in a nonreactive container
  until cool, stirring occasionally.
  
  Meanwhile, wash and sterilize 4 1-quart jars and lids to be used in
  the canning by placing them briefly in a pot of hot water. When the
  pickled mixture has cooled, fill the jars to the top with the
  cucumbers and onions only, not the brine. Once you have filled all
  the jars, divide the brine between the jars, filling them to the top.
  With a hot clean towel, wipe the edges of the jars, secure the lids
  and screw on the rings. You will now need to process them for 8-10
  minutes in a simmering water bath. It is important for the jars to be
  on a rack so they do not touch each other or the bottom of the pot.
  The jars must be completely covered by the water therefore use a huge
  pot. (Contact your local Ball Jar distributor for information on
  equipment: racks, tongs, even pots). Allow the water in processing
  bath to come to a boil, turn it down to a simmer and carefully place
  the jars on a rack inside of the pot. Simmer for 8-10 minutes.
  Carefully remove from the water, allow to cool, don't let the jars
  touch. When they are cool, they should have a tight seal, no sound
  should be heard when you push on the lid. Store for months on your
  shelf.

           Stick, slivered
      1    Ripe plantain, skinned and
           Cut into thick slices
      2    Crisp-fried corn tortillas
      3    Thick slices dried French
           Bread
      1    (2-ounce) tablet Mexican
           Drinking chocolate
           Sea salt to taste
 
  Put the chicken into a saucepan with the garlic, onions, and mint.
  Add the water to cover and salt to taste. Bring to a simmer, cover
  the pan, and continue simmering until the chicken is just tender,
  about 35 minutes. Strain, reserving the broth.
  
  Remove the stems from the dried chiles. Slit them open, and remove
  seeds and veins, reserving the seeds. Toast the chiles for about 50
  seconds on each side; if you're using guajillos, toast them longer,
  until they are almost charred, about 2 minutes.
  
  Rinse the chiles in cold water, cover with hot water, and leave to
  soak for about 30 minutes.
  
  Put the reserved chile seeds into an ungreased frying pan and toast
  over fairly high heat, shaking them around from time to time so that
  they brown evenly. Then raise the heat and char until black. Cover
  with cold water and set aside to soak for about 5 minutes. Strain and
  put into a blender jar. Add the broiled tomatoes, unpeeled, to the
  blender jar along with the water, cloves, allspice, thyme, marjoram,
  and oregano.
  
  Heat some of the lard in a small frying pan and fry the sesame seed
  until a deep golden color, a few seconds. Strain, putting the fat
  back into the pan and the seeds into the blender jar, and blend as
  smooth as possible. Fry the rest of the ingredients, except the
  chiles and chocolate, one by one, strain, and put into the blender
  jar, blending after each addition and adding water or broth as
  necessary to release the blades.
  
  Heat 1/4 cup of the lard in the heavy pan in which you are going to
  cook the mole, add the blended mixture, and fry over medium heat,
  stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan from time to time, for
  about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, put a few of the chiles and about 2 cups
  of the water in which they were soaking into the blender jar and
  blend until smooth. When you have blended all the chiles, add them to
  the fried ingredients together with the chocolate and cook for 5
  minutes longer.
  
  Add about 4 cups of the chicken broth and continue cooking for 35
  minutes. Skim the fat that forms on the top if you are going to make
  tamales or mole. It is added to color and flavor the masa. Add more
  broth if necessary, the mole should just coat the back of a wooden
  spoon. Add the chicken and salt to taste; cook for 10 minutes longer.

  bread to the pan and fry over low heat until a deep golden color;
  transfer to the blender jar. Adding more chile water if necessary,
  blend until you have a smooth puree. Gradually add the soaked chiles
  with more water as necessary and blend until smooth. When all the
  chiles have been blended, dip a spoon into the bottom of the blender
  jar and take out a sample of the sauce to see if the rather tough
  chile skins have been blended sufficiently. If not, add a little more
  water, stir well, and then blend for a few seconds more.
  
  Heat the remaining lard in a heavy pan or saute pan, add the blended
  sauce and chocolate, and cook over medium heat, stirring and scraping
  the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking, for about 15 minutes. Add
  2 cups of the chicken broth and the chicken pieces, taste for salt,
  and cook for 15 minutes more. The sauce should be fairly thick and
  lightly cover the back of a wooden spoon.
  
  Serve with white rice and tortillas.

 Categories: Emeril
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Beef tenderloin
      2 tb Olive oil
           Salt
    1/4 c  Cracked black pepper
      6    Cloves of peeled garlic
      5 tb Butter
      1 lg Onion, julienned
      2 lg Idaho white potatoes,
           Peeled
           Freshly ground white pepper
      4 oz Grated Cheddar cheese
      8 oz Chopped crispy bacon
      2 ts Chopped chives
    3/4 c  Classic Bordelaise Sauce
           (recipe follows)
    3/4 c  Maytag Blue Sabayon Sauce
           (recipe follows)
      1 tb Finely chopped fresh parsley
           Leaves
 
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Season the fillet with olive oil,
  salt and cracked black pepper. Make six small slits in the
  tenderloin. Stuff each slit with a clove of garlic. In a large saute
  pan, over high heat, sear the fillet for 2 minutes on each side.
  Remove from the pan and place in the oven. Roast for 15 to 20 minutes
  for medium rare. Remove from the oven and rest for 5 to 10 minutes
  before slicing. In a saute pan, over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon
  of the butter. Add the onions. Season with salt and pepper. Cook the
  onions until caramelized, about 10 to 12 minutes, stirring
  occasionally. Remove from the heat and set aside. Using a box grater,
  grate the potatoes. Season the potatoes with salt and pepper. In a
  medium nonstick pan, over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the
  butter. Add half of the grated potatoes and press firmly into the
  pan, covering the entire area of the pan. Cook the potatoes until
  golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes. Using a long metal spatula, flip
  over the potato cake and continue to cook until golden and crispy.
  Remove the potato cake and place on a parchment or waxed paper lined
  baking sheet. In the same pan, melt the remaining butter. Repeat the
  process with the remaining potatoes. Spoon the caramelized onions
  over one of the potato cakes. Spread the cheese over the onions. Top
  the cheese with the crispy bacon and chives. Place the other potato
  cake on top of the bacon and place in the oven. Cook for about 4
  minutes or until the potato is crispy and the cheese starts to melt.
  Remove from the oven and cut the potato cake into fourths. Carve the
  fillet into individual slices. To serve, place a wedge of the potato
  cake in the center of each plate. Arrange the beef slices on top of
  each potato wedge. Spoon the Bordelaise sauce around the potatoes.
  Drizzle each plate with the Maytag Blue Sabayon and garnish with
  parsley.

      Title: Down Island French Toast
 Categories: Emeril
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Vanilla bean, preferably
           Tahitian, cut in half
           Lengthwise
      1 c  Cointreau or Curacao
      1 ts Ground mace
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
           Zest of 1 orange
     12 oz Fresh foie gras, cleaned and
           Cut in half
      5    Eggs, beaten
      2 c  Half and half
     12 sl Slightly sliced stale
           Broiche, cut into triangles
    1/3    Inch thick
    1/4 c  Clarified butter
      1    Recipe Citrus-Savory Caramel
           Sauce (recipe follows)
 
  Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean. Add half of the scrapped
  beans to a mixing bowl with the liquor. Add 1/2 teaspoon ground mace,
  1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, and orange zest, and whisk together.
  Put the foie gras into the marinade and cover with plastic wrap.
  Slosh the marinade around a little and keep refrigerated. Add the
  remaining vanilla bean seeds in a mixing bowl, and add the eggs and
  half and half. Add the remaining mace and cinnamon and beat the
  mixture together. Soak the brioche slices in the egg mixture and
  allow them to absorb the flavor. Soaking time will depend on the
  freshness of the brioche; the softer it is, the shorter the soaking
  (sometimes 1 minute is sufficient). Keep covered in the refrigerator
  until ready to complete the dish. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.
  Remove the foie gras from the marinade and cut the slices about
  1/4-inch to 1/3-inch thick. Reserve on a chilled plate and discard
  almost all of the marinade. Remove the brioche from the egg wash and
  lay the slices on a plate. Heat the clarified butter in a nonstick
  skillet, add the bread, and cook over medium heat until golden on
  both sides. Transfer to a plate and keep warm in the oven. Reheat the
  caramel sauce and place 2 tablespoons on each of 4 warm serving
  plates. Heat a nonstick skillet or pan and when hot, sear the foie
  gras slices over high heat for 15 seconds on each side until seared
  and very dark. Place the foie gras on the brioche in layers: a slice
  of brioche on the bottom, a slice of foie gras, then brioche, another
  layer of foie gras, and topped with brioche. Serve with mixed
  tropical fruits and orange segments, if desired.

    1/4 lb Grated cheddar cheese
    1/4 lb White grated cheddar cheese
           Vegetable Oil for frying
           Salt and pepper to taste
           Creole Seasoning
 
  In the bowl of an electric mixer, place two tablespoons of the
  vegetable oil, yeast and sugar. The mixer should be fitted with a
  dough hook. Then add the water. With the mixer on low speed, beat the
  mixture for about 4 minutes to dissolve the yeast. *Note, if the
  yeast mixture doesn't begin to foam after a few minutes, it means
  it's not active and will have to be replaced.
  
  In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, 1/2 cup plus the 2
  tablespoons of the cornmeal, and the salt. Then add this mixture to
  the yeast mixture. On low speed begin to mix the dough. Increase the
  speed as the dough begins to pull away from he sides of the bowl and
  form a ball.
  
  Remove dough from bowl and lightly coat the entire surface with the
  remaining teaspoon of vegetable oil. Place dough in clean bowl
  (preferably glass). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Then set in a
  warm, dry place and let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours.
  
  Meanwhile, in a saute pan melt the butter. Add onions and peppers.
  Season with salt, pepper and creole seasoning. saute for 2 minutes.
  Season crawfish with salt, pepper, and creole seasoning and then add
  crawfish to the saute pan. Saute for 2 minutes and then remove from
  pan, set aside to cool to room temperature.
  
  When the dough has doubled in size, remove from bowl and turn onto a
  lightly floured surface. Using your hands gently roll dough and form a
  narrow loaf about 24 inches long. Now cut dough into 18 equal pieces.
  With a rolling pin, roll each on a lightly floured surface to form
  thin round disks, about 1/8-inch thick.
  
  In a bowl combine the cooled crawfish mixture with booth cheddar
  cheeses. Mix well.
  
  Spread about 2 tablespoons of the filling over half of the dough
  round. Fold the other half of the dough over the filling, forming a
  half-moon shape, and then pinch the edges tightly to seal completely.
  
  Now sprinkle two parchment lined baking sheets with remaining
  cornmeal. Place the completed breads on the baking sheet about 1-inch
  apart. Cover the breads with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm, dry
  place until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
  
  In a one gallon sauce pot, heat enough vegetable oil to freely deep
  fry 2 or 3 half moons at a time (several inches deep). When the oil
  reaches 350 degrees F carefully add the stuffed breads. Fry for about
  3 minutes, turning them with a metal spoon for even frying. Remove
  from the oil and drain on a paper-towel lined plate. Season while hot
  with creole seasoning.

 Categories: Emeril
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  Finely chopped fresh or
           Frozen peaches
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  (1 stick) butter, at room
           Temperature
      2    Eggs
  1 1/2 c  Milk

 Categories: Emeril
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    3/4 c  Warm water (105 degrees F to
    115    Degrees F)
    1/2 c  Milk (105 degrees to 115
           Degrees F)
      1 ts Pure vanilla extract
    1/4 oz Dry active yeast
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      4 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Cardamom
      1    Egg yolk
           Flour for dusting, about 1/2
           Cup
      2    Sticks (8 ounces) cold
           Unsalted butter
      2    Eggs beaten with 1
           TB water
      3 tb Sugar
      1 tb Ground cinnamon
     12 tb Sweetened cream cheese
     12 ts Raspberry jam
      1 c  Almond filling
      1 c  Crushed almond
    1/2 c  Apricot glaze
 
  In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the water, milk, vanilla and
  yeast together. With the mixer fitted with a dough hook, on low, beat
  the mixture for about 4 minutes to dissolve the yeast. Sift the
  sugar, salt, flour and cardamom together. Add this mixture and the
  egg yolk to the yeast mixture. Mix on low speed until it light comes
  together, then increase the speed to medium and beat until the
  mixture pulls away from the sides of the bowl, forms a ball, and
  climbs slightly up the dough hook. Remove the dough from the bowl and
  let rest in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. On a floured surface,
  place the butter. Lightly dust the top of the butter with flour.
  Using a rolling pin, lightly pound the butter until flat. Fold the
  butter in half and continue to pound the butter until the butter is
  workable. Using your hands, shape the butter into a 8-inch square.
  Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a second floured
  surface. Roll the dough into a 16 inch square. Place the butter in
  the center of the dough. Fold the ends of the dough in towards the
  center, forming a package. Lightly press the ends into the dough,
  sealing the package completely. Carefully lift the package off of the
  surface and redust the surface with flour. Lay the package back down
  on the floured surface. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out to
  about a 24-inch rectangle. Fold one end of the dough into the center,
  then the other end, so that it resembles a letter, and forms a
  square. (You should have three layers of dough) Place the dough in
  the refrigerator and allow the dough to rest for 25 minutes. Roll out
  the dough a second time, forming a rectangle. Repeat the folding
  process from above two more times, making sure the dust rest between
  turns. The following directions are for two types of Danish pastries:
  
  For Cinnamon Rolls:
  
  Roll the dough out 1/4 inch thick. Egg wash the dough. Sprinkle the
  sugar and cinnamon over the egg wash. Starting at the bottom, roll
  the dough up lengthwise, forming a jelly-roll. Cut the pastry into
  1-inch slices. Place the slices, cinnamon and sugar side on a
  parchment lined baking sheet and let rise for 30 to 40 minutes.
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Brush the tops of each pastry with
  the egg wash and bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees
  F and continue to bake for 10 minutes or until browned and crisp.
  Brush the pastries with the glaze and serve warm.
  
  Yield: 12 servings
  
  For Pinwheel:
  
  On a floured surface, roll the dough out 1/4 inch thick. Cut the
  dough into 12 (4-inch) squares. Brush the edges of the dough with the
  egg wash. Add a spoonful of the cream cheese filling to the center of
  the square. Place a teaspoon of the jam in the center of the cream
  cheese. Cut diagonally from each corner to within 3/4 inch of the
  center. Fold the four alternate points to the center, pressing them
  down lightly to hold them in place. Place the pastries on a parchment
  lined baking sheet and let rise for 30 to 40 minutes. Preheat the
  oven to 400 degrees F. Brush the tops of each pastry with the egg
  wash and bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and
  continue to bake for 10 minutes or until browned and crisp. Brush the
  pastries with the glaze and serve warm.
  
  Yield: 12 servings
  
  For Bear Claws:
  
  Roll the dough out to 1/4-inch thick. The longer the dough the more
  claws yielded. Egg wash the entire piece of dough. Spread a thin
  layer of almond filling horizontally down the center third of the
  dough. Fold the bottom third of the dough up to cover the filling.
  Fold the top third of the dough down, like your folding a business
  letter. Egg wash the dough. Sprinkle with crushed almonds. Cut the
  dough into 1-inch pieces, crosswise (the shorter end). Make three
  slashes into the sides of each piece and spread gently into a
  horse-shoe shape to separate the toes. Proof until dough in size
  about 15 to 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Bake for
  10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and continue to bake for
  10 minutes, or until golden and crispy. Remove from the oven and
  brush with the apricot glaze and serve.

  and marinate, refrigerated, overnight. The next day, prepare an
  outdoor grill for cooking. Right before grilling, toss the onions,
  peppers and mushrooms with the olive oil, salt and pepper. When the
  grill is hot, grill the swordfish until it is well colored on both
  sides and the interior is medium (about 3 to 4 minutes per side,
  total).When you have added the fish to the grill, spread the
  vegetables along the perimeter of the grill and carefully cook the

     15 oz Whole-wheat flour
      5 oz Plain white flour
      2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Baking soda
      3 oz Soft butter
    1/2 pt Buttermilk
      1 oz Sunflower seeds
 
  In a large bowl mix together the two flours, sugar, salt, and baking
  soda. Rub in the butter with your fingers until the mixture resembles
  fine bread crumbs. Make a center well and pour in buttermilk. Mix
  again and shape into a round cake. Sprinkle with sunflower seeds.
  Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in a 400-degree oven. Test by inserting a
  long wooden skewer into the center of the bread. If it comes out
  clean the bread is cooked. If tapped on the bottom, it should sound
  hollow. Take out and cool on a wire tray.
  
  This is an old recipe given to my wife, Marie Deering, by her mother.
  The sunflower seeds are a recent embellishment.

     12    Unblemished organically
           Grown small lemons
           (preferably Meyer lemons)
           Kosher or table salt
 
  Wash and dry the lemons. If using store-bought lemons, scrub them
  carefully to remove any pesticides. Cut a thin slice from the top and
  bottom of each lemon. Set one lemon on end and make a vertical cut
  three quarters of the way through the fruit, so that the two halves
  still remain attached at the base; do not cut it in half. Turn the
  lemon upside down and rotate it so that you can make a second
  vertical cut down the center, crosswise to the first, leaving the
  bottom arched, as you did previously. Fill each cut with as much salt
  as it will hold.
  
  Carefully place the lemon at the bottom of a hot, sterilized,
  wide-mouthed glass jar. Proceed in this manner with the remaining
  lemons, compressing them in the jar until no space is left and the
  lemon juice has risen to the top. Seal and set aside at room
  temperature. More lemons may be added in the following days as the
  lemon rinds begin to soften.

 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      5    To 6 pounds chicken,
           Preferably small chickens
           Weighing no more than 2 or
  2 1/2    Pounds, including livers and
           Giblets
      1    Lemon, cut into quarters
           Handful of fine sea salt
    1/2 c  Minced cilantro
    1/2 c  Minced flat-leaf parsley
      2 tb Minced garlic
      1 tb Ground ginger
           Freshly ground black pepper
           To taste
    1/4 ts Saffron threads
      2    Whole preserved lemons
    1/4 c  Water
    1/2 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
      4 md Onions, halved and very
           Thinly sliced
      1 tb Sweet paprika
      1 tb Unsalted butter (optional)
      1 c  Best-quality black or violet
           Olives
 
  Remove all traces of fat and any fibers from the chickens. Rinse
  thoroughly, inside and out, in cool running water. Rub them all over,
  inside and out, with lemon quarters, being sure to rub between the
  skin and flesh of the breasts. Rub salt all over the chickens. Set
  aside in a cool place to drain for at least 30 minutes or refrigerate
  the chickens covered, overnight. Trim any greenish spots off the
  livers and pull away and discard giblet linings. When you=re ready to
  cook, rinse the chickens again in cool running water and pat them dry
  with paper towels. Set aside.
  
  In a heavy pot or kettle large enough to hold all the chickens, mix
  the cilantro, parsley, garlic, ginger and pepper. Crumble the saffron
  into the herbs. Cut one of the preserved lemons into small pieces and
  add to the mixture along with the water.
  
  Mix the seasoning all together well, then put the chickens into the
  pot and use your hands to rub them all over, inside and out, with the
  seasoning sauce. Add the giblets to the middle of the pot, pour the
  olive oil over, and set the kettle on very low heat. As the chicken
  begins to sizzle in the sauce, add the onions and shake the pan to
  distribute evenly around the birds. Cover the pan and cook very
  slowly until the chickens are thoroughly cooked and the onions have
  almost disintegrated into the sauce. After 30 minutes of cooking, add
  the livers to the pot, together with the paprika, shaking the kettle
  to distribute the paprika in the sauce. Total cooking time will be 1
  1/2 to 2 hours.
  
  When the chickens are thoroughly cooked, remove them from the sauce.
  Cut whole chickens into halves or quarters and arrange them on a warm
  platter. Take the gizzards and hearts out of the sauce, cut them into
  small bits, and stir them back in. Using a fork, coarsely crush the
  livers in sauce. Sauce should be quite thick; if it seems too thin,
  let it boil down, stirring frequently, until it is the right
  consistency. Add the butter if desired and the olives. Swirl the pan
  to distribute the olives and emulsify the sauce. Pour the sauce over
  the chickens on the platter and garnish with strips of peel from the
  second preserved lemon. (If you are not using preserved lemons,
  garnish the chickens with grated lemon zest).

      5 lb Boneless pork butt, trimmed

      1 lb Dried black beans
      1 lb Chopped fresh oregano
           Leaves
      1 ts Ground cumin
      2    Bay leaves
      2 qt Water
      6    Red bell peppers, seeded
      2    White onions
     20    Cloves garlic
           Boniato Puree:
      2 lb Boniato, peeled and cut into
    1/2    Inch dice
      4 c  Milk
      2 c  Water
      2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
      8    Cachuca peppers, seeded and
           Minced
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh cilantro
           Leaves
           Juice of 4 limes
           Garnish:
      1    Boniato
      3 c  Vegetable oil
 
  Using a mandolin slicer, cut the boniato into strips. Heat the oil to
  350 degrees in a deep fryer or heavy-bottomed saucepan. Immediately
  add the boniato strips. Deep-fry until golden, 3 to 4 minutes
  (cooking in batches if necessary). Remove the strips with a wire mesh
  strainer and drain on paper towels.
  
  Place all the marinade ingredients except the water in a food
  processor or blender. With the motor running, add the water gradually
  to form a puree.
  
  Place the pork in a large ovenproof dish or nonreactive pan and pour
  the marinade over the pork. Cover, and marinate in refrigerator for
  12 hours, or overnight. Turn the pork occasionally.
  
  Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Place the pork and marinade in the
  oven and bake until the pork is very tender and almost falling apart,
  about 3 hours. Remove the pork and let cool slightly. Using two
  forks, shred the pork.
  
  Meanwhile, to prepare the black bean broth, place the beans, oregano,
  cumin, bay leaves, and water in a large sauce-pan, adding more water,
  if necessary, to cover the beans. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat,
  and simmer for 2 hours, adding enough water to keep the beans
  covered. Place the bell peppers, onions, and garlic through a juicer
  and add the juice to the saucepan and simmer for another 20 minutes.
  
  To prepare the boniato puree, place the boniato, milk and water in a
  large saucepan and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer until
  tender, about one hour. Drain the boniato and mash with a fork. Add a
  touch of milk, if necessary, to keep the boniato moist.
  
  While the boniato is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet
  and add the shredded pork, peppers and cilantro. Cook over
  medium-high heat, stirring continuously, until crispy. Add the lime
  juice at the last minute.
  
  Spoon some mashed boniato onto each serving plate. Serve the pork on
  top of the boniato and ladle some of the black bean broth around it.

      1 c  Confectioners sugar
    1/2 c  Almond flour
     12 tb Cold unsalted butter, cut
           Into small pieces
      2    Eggs
           Banana filling:
      4    Ripe bananas, sliced
      4 tb Unsalted butter, cut into
        sm Pieces
    1/2 c  Dark brown sugar
           Chocolate Tart Mixture:
      3 oz El Rey Chocolates Bucare
           Bitter
      3 tb Unsalted butter
      3    Egg yolks
    1/4 c  Sugar
      3    Egg whites
 
  Make the crust:
  
  Place the flour, sugar and almond flour in the bowl of a heavy-duty
  mixer. Add the butter, and using the paddle attachment, beat the
  butter into the dry ingredients until a grainy texture is reached and
  no lumps of butter are visible.
  
  Add the eggs and mix on low speed until a smooth dough forms.
  Preferably, chill the dough overnight, or at least 2 hours before
  rolling out to line a 10-inch tart pan.
  
  Make the banana filling:
  
  Place the sliced bananas into the prepared tart shell. Place the
  pieces of butter on top of the bananas. Sprinkle with the brown sugar.
  
  Make the tart mixture and assemble:
  
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In the top of a double boiler over
  hot, not boiling water, melt the chocolate and butter, stirring
  frequently. Set aside.
  
  In a medium bowl, whip the egg yolks and 1 1/2 tablespoons of the
  sugar together until the sugar dissolves and the yolks are light in
  color and texture. In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites until
  foamy; then while continuing to whip, sprinkle in the remaining sugar
  and whip until soft peaks form.
  
  Fold the yolks into the chocolate mixture. Carefully fold the beaten
  whites into a chocolate mixture until well combined.
  
  Pour an even layer of the tart mixture over the bananas in the tart
  shell. Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 20 minutes, or
  until the crust turns golden-brown. Remove from the oven; let cook
  slightly. Then carefully remove from the mold. Before serving, warm
  slightly.

 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  Sifted cake flour
  1 1/2 c  Sugar, divided
      3 tb Unsweetened cocoa powder
      1 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Sunflower oil
      2 tb Kahlua or other coffee
           Flavored liqueur
      2 tb Pure vanilla extract
      7 lg Egg whites
      1 ts Cream of tartar
           Nonstick cooking spray or
           Oil to brush on baking pan
           Port Wine and Raspberry
           Sauce
 
  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
  
  Into a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, 1 cups of the
  sugar, the cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Make a
  well in the center and add the oil, Kahlua and vanilla. Do not mix.
  
  In another bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar until white
  and foamy. Slowly add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and continue
  beating until stiff peaks form. Do not overbeat. Mix 1/4 of the egg
  whites until well incorporated into the flour mixture. Gently fold in
  the remaining egg whites using a rubber spatula.
  
  Spray a 9-inch tube pan with nonstick cooking spray, or brush the
  inside with oil. Dust with flour and tap out the excess. Pour the
  batter into the prepared pan. Bang the mold on the counter to remove
  any air bubbles. Bake for 55 minutes, or until the top feels springy,
  or until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool
  the cake upright on a wire rack for 1 hour. Loosen the sides with a
  small, thin knife. Remove the cake from the pan and allow it to cool.
  Wrap airtight, or serve immediately with a light sifting of
  confectioners' sugar accompanied by the Port Wine and Raspberry Sauce.

      Title: Raspberry And Vanilla Cheesecake
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      6 oz Chocolate wafers
     24 oz Cream cheese, softened
      8 oz Sour cream
      2 tb Pure vanilla extract
      8    Eggs
  1 1/2 c  Sugar, divided
    1/4 c  Raspberry puree (see below)
      4    Egg whites
 
  To make the crust, place the wafers in a food processor fitted with
  the metal blade and process until finely crushed. Add a couple of
  drops of water. Press the mixture evenly and firmly onto the bottom
  of a springform pan (see note below), making a fist and using the
  back of your hand and fingers. Refrigerate the crust while you make
  the filling.
  
  Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
  
  Using an electric mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the cream
  cheese until smooth. On low speed, add the sour cream and vanilla and
  set aside. In a clean mixing bowl, using the whisk attachment,
  combine the eggs and 1 cup of the sugar. Whisk for 4 to 5 minutes
  until fluffy. Fold in the softened cream cheese mixture. Separate
  this mixture into two large glass bowls. To one of the bowls, add the
  raspberry puree, mix well.
  
  In another bowl, using an electric mixer with clean, dry beaters,
  beat the egg whites. Start at low speed and increase the speed as the
  peaks form. Slowly add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar. When the whites
  are stiff but not dry, scrape them equally into the two bowls of
  filling and use a spatula to gently fold them in. Don't overmix the
  filling.
  
  Pour alternating plain mixture and raspberry mixture into the
  prepared pan until the pan is filled. Bake for approximately 1 hour,
  until the cake has risen and browned slightly and it just shimmies
  when you gently move the pan. It's a good idea to place the
  springform on a low, flat, pan, such as a pizza pan, to catch any
  batter that leaks. Turn the heat off and let the cake stand in the
  oven for 1 hour more. Remove the cake from the oven and cool before
  serving. You can make this cake a day ahead.
  
  Yield: 16 slices
  
  Note: To make raspberry puree, take 1 pint of fresh or frozen
  raspberries, process very fine in a food processor, and strain
  through a very fine sieve.
  
  Note: If your springform pan has lost some of its spring, cover the
  bottom and halfway up the sides with foil to prevent any leaking
  batter from landing on the bottom of your oven and burning.

           Sauce--
    1/4 c  Extra virgin olive oil
      2 tb Chopped garlic
      1    Shallot, minced
      1 ts Crushed red pepper flakes
      3    Tomatoes, peeled, seeded and
           Chopped
           Croquettes:
      4 lg Idaho potatoes, peeled
      3    Egg yolks
    1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Pepper
    1/4 lb Mozzarella cheese, cut into
    1/4    -inch dice
      3    Egg whites, slightly beaten
           Until frothy
  1 1/2 c  Bread crumbs
           Vegetable oil for frying
 
  To make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a small pan over medium
  heat. Add the garlic and saute until beige. Add the shallot and cook
  until translucent and the garlic is a light golden color. (Don't let
  the garlic burn or it will taste bitter.) Add the pepper flakes and
  saute for about 10 seconds more. Add the tomatoes and simmer for 15
  to 20 minutes.
  
  To make the croquettes: Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F.
  
  In a saucepan, boil the potatoes until tender. Drain the potatoes,
  place on a sheet pan, and allow to dry in the oven for about 5 to 10
  minutes. Pass the potatoes through a food mill or ricer (passatutto)
  and let them cool in a bowl. Stir in the egg yolks and the Parmesan
  cheese. Season with the salt and pepper.
  
  Place 2 tablespoons of the potato mixture in the palm of your hand
  and make a small ball. Make an indentation in the center with your
  thumb. Place 3 cubes of the mozzarella in the center and bring up the
  sides of the potato mixture to cover it. Pinch it well and then roll
  it between the palms of your hands until it forms a stick about 2 1/2
  inches long. Repeat the process. Once you have all the potato sticks
  done, roll them in the egg whites, then in the bread crumbs. Remove
  excess crumbs and again roll them lightly between the palms of your
  hands to set the bread crumbs.
  
  Pour vegetable oil to a depth of 2 inches into a skillet and heat
  until a drop of batter dropped into the oil rises right away. Deep
  fry the croquettes until golden brown, drain on paper towels, and
  serve immediately with the sauce on the side for dipping.

      Title: Chicken Paillard With Chive And Mustard Sauce Diane
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    6 ounce chicken breasts,
           Butterflied and pounded with
           Meat tenderizer
           To 1/4inch thick
           Salt and freshly ground
           Black pepper to taste
      2 tb Unsalted butter
      3 tb Chopped shallots
      2 oz Fine brandy
    1/4 c  White wine
      1 tb Dijon mustard
    3/4 c  Veal stock
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
      3 tb Chopped fresh chives
 
  Since each pounded, flattened chicken should have a large
  circumference, it will be necessary to cook the four breasts one at a
  time, setting each aside on a warm platter as you finish those that
  remain or use two pans to cook two simultaneously.
  
  Season the chicken with salt and pepper.  Heat a large, heavy skillet
  over medium heat.  Add 1/2 tablespoon of butter to the hot pan and
  heat the butter until it begins to foam.  Add the first breast and
  sear, cooking for 3 to 4 minutes on a side before turning it over and
  allowing another 4 minutes on the second side.  Remove the chicken
  from the pan and place on a warm platter.  Repeat for the remaining
  chicken breasts, adding butter to the pan and sauteeing both sides.
  After all the chicken has been cooked and removed from the pan, add
  the shallots and cook two minutes until translucent.  Lower the heat,
  move the pan away, and cautiously add the brandy.  Being careful not
  to flame the brandy, return the pan to the stove, and over low heat,
  allow it to cook off.  Add the white wine to the pan, raise the heat,
  and bring quickly to the boil. Stir in the mustard. Allow this to
  cook for 1 minute before adding the veal stock. Cook for 2 to 3
  minutes more.  Add the cream. Bring just to the boil. Remove from the
  heat and stir in the chives.
  
  Place the ovenproof platter of chicken breasts in a preheated 350
  degree oven for 1 to 2 minutes to reheat them very quickly before
  placing them on individual dishes and topping with some of the Diane
  Sauce. Serve with garlic mashed potatoes.

      1 tb Salt
      1 lb Dried fettucine
      3 tb Pine nuts
      2 tb Extra virgin olive oil
     16    To 20 medium, fresh shrimp,
           Peeled and de-veined
           Salt and freshly ground
           Pepper to taste
    1/2 c  Sun-dried tomatoes, soaked
           In 1 cup hot water for 30
           Minutes, then
           Drained and julienned
      1 tb Chopped garlic
    1/4 ts Red pepper flakes
    1/4 c  Fresh basil leaves
 
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
  
  Bring the water to a rolling boil in a large pot. Add 1 tablespoon
  salt and re-boil. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until
  "al dente".
  
  Place the pine nuts on a cookie sheet and put in the oven for about 3
  minutes, until slightly browned. Set aside.
  
  Meanwhile, stack the basil leaves and slice into julienne strips. Use
  a very sharp knife to avoid bruising the basil, causing it to turn
  black. Set aside.
  
  Heat the oil in a large saute pan. Season the shrimp with salt and
  pepper and add the shrimp to the hot pan. Cook for 1 minute before
  turning and cooking on the other side. Add the tomatoes to the shrimp
  and cook for 2 minutes more. Remove the pan from the heat and add the
  basil, garlic, red pepper, and half the pine nuts. Adjust seasoning.
  
  When pasta is "al dente", drain and toss it in the saute pan with the
  shrimp/tomato/herb mixture. Divide among 4 plates and garnish each
  serving with the remaining pine nuts.

      Title: Grilled Vegetable Salad With Goat Cheese
 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lg Red bell pepper
      1 lg Orange or yellow bell
           Pepper
      2    Or 3 small zucchini
      2    Or 3 small yellow summer
           Squash
      1 md Eggplant
      1 md Red onion
      1 lg Portobello mushroom
           Vegetable cooking spray
    1/4 c  Rosemary Garlic Oil (recipe
           Follows)
      1 lg Or 2 smaller bunches
           Arugula
           Salt and coarsely ground
           Black pepper
      2 tb Balsamic vinegar
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
      2 oz Rindless goat cheese, such
           As Montrachet or Coach
           Farms
 
  Cut out the pepper stems and then slice each lengthwise along the
  ribs or ridges into 3 or 4 large triangular wedges. Trim the stem and
  blossom ends from the zucchini and squash and cut them lengthwise
  into thin slices. Trim the eggplant and cut crosswise into 12 slices
  1/4 to 3/8-inch thick. Peel the onion and cut into 1/4-inch slices.
  
  Trim the portobello mushroom stem even with the cap so it will lie
  flat on the grill. Brush all over with 1/2 tablespoon of the Rosemary
  Garlic Oil. Set aside.
  
  Set a cast iron grill pan over high heat and coat with vegetable
  cooking spray. Let it warm up for 3 to 5 minutes (or light your
  outdoor grill). Using a pastry brush, coat the zucchini, squash,
  eggplant, and red onion slices with about 2 1/2 tablespoons of the
  remaining oil; it will be a very thin film, but it should be enough.
  The peppers do not need any. Grill the vegetables, except the onion
  in batches as necessary, on each side, rotating them 45 degrees to
  make cross-hatch grill marks. They should be cooked until they are
  nicely browned, but not charred, cooked through but still hold their
  texture. The peppers will have black marks on the outside, but they
  are eaten with their skin and bright color intact. Grill the mushroom
  stem side down first, so when it is turned and finishes cooking, the
  juices will be retained. Reduce the heat to medium high and grill the
  onion, turning and rotating as described, until tender and browned
  but not burned. Here are the approximate cooking times, which will
  vary with your grill:
  
  Peppers - 6 to 7 minutes per side
  
  Zucchini and squash - 2 to 3 minutes on first side, 2 minutes on
  second
  
  Eggplant - 4 to 6 minutes per side
  
  Red Onion - 3 to 4 minutes per side
  
  Portobello - 5 to 6 minutes per side
  
  As the vegetables are cooked, transfer them to plates or a large
  baking sheet lined with wax paper. Transfer the portobello to a
  cutting board and let cool for at least 5 minutes; then slice. Be
  sure to reserve any mushroom juices. Season the grilled vegetables
  and mushroom lightly with salt and pepper.
  
  Line a large round or oval serving platter with the arugula. Arrange
  the grilled vegetables decoratively in bunches around the edge of the
  platter. Pile up the pepper wedges in the center.
  
  In a small bowl, whisk together the balsamic vinegar and lemon juice
  with the remaining Garlic Rosemary Oil. Mix in any reserved mushroom
  juices. Drizzle evenly over the salad. Crumble goat cheese on top.
  Serve at room temperature.

 Categories: Tvfn
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Cooked taro
  2 1/2 c  Water
 
  Peel the cooled taro and cut into 1-inch cubes. Grind the taro in a
  meat grinder, place the ground taro in a calabash (wooden bowl) and
  use a poi pounder to mash the taro. Wet your other hand, slip it
  under the taro and turn the pounded taro over so that it will not
  stickto the calabash. Continue to mash and turn the pounded taro over
  each time. Wet the poi pounder from time to time so it does not stick
  and keep working at it until it is smooth and thick. Poi which has
  not been mixed with water may be kept at room temperature for several
  days by keeping it in the calabash and covering it with a damp cloth.
  If the poi is kept in a refrigerator it should be mixed with water
  before storing.
  
  To mix: Add a little water and stir round and round with the hand
  until all the water is absorbed. Keep adding water a little at a time
  until poi is the consistency as thick or as thin as you like to eat
  it. Store in a cool place or serve immediately. Or let it stand 2 to
  3 days for a sour flavor.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Nut Crumb Crust-
    1/2 c  Almonds or pecans
      1 c  All-purpose bleached flour
    1/3 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/8 ts Salt
      6 tb (3/4 stick) unsalted butter,
           Melted
           Filling:
  2 1/2 c  Milk
    2/3 c  Light brown sugar
        pn Salt
    1/3 c  Cornstarch
      3 lg Eggs
      4 tb Unsalted butter, softened
      2 ts Vanilla extract
           Topping:
      1 c  Heavy cream
      2 tb Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  For the crumb crust: Butter a 9-inch pyrex pie pan. Set a rack at the
  middle level of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees.
  
  Place nuts in bowl of food processor fitted with metal blade. Pulse
  10 or 12 times at 1-second intervals to finely grind without reducing
  to a paste. Remove cover and scrape inside of work bowl with a
  spatula.
  
  Add remaining ingredients except butter and pulse once or twice to
  combine.
  
  Add butter and pulse 3 or 4 times, until mixture is evenly moistened
  and looks crumbly. Remove blade and turn mixture out into prepared
  pan.
  
  Using your fingertips, distribute the crumb mixture evenly over the
  bottom and sides of the pan, gently pressing into place. Make sure
  that the crumb coating is even because thin spots will burn during
  baking.
  
  Use the back of a spoon to smooth the surface of the crust and to
  make the rim of the crust straight and even.
  
  Bake the crust for about 20 minutes, or until the surface of the
  crust is a deep golden brown. Watch carefully, because the high sugar
  content makes them burn easily. Cool on rack.
  
  To make the filling: Combine 2 cups milk, sugar and salt in a
  nonreactive saucepan; whisk once to mix and bring to a boil over low
  heat. Place remaining 1/2 cup milk in a mixing bowl and whisk in
  cornstarch, then eggs. Return milk and sugar mixture to a boil over
  low heat then whisk about a third of it into the egg mixture. Return
  milk and sugar mixture to a boil once more and whisk in the egg
  mixture, whisking constantly until the filling thickens and comes to
  a boil. Allow to boil, whisking constantly, for about 30 seconds.
  Remove from heat, whisk in butter and vanilla; pour into a
  nonreactive bowl. Press plastic wrap against the surface of the
  filling and chill until it is approximately 75 degrees. Spread the
  cooled filling evenly in the cooled crust.
  
  To finish the pie, whip the cream with the sugar and vanilla until it
  holds a firm peak. Use a hand mixer on medium speed or a heavy-duty
  mixer fitted with the whisk. Spread the cream over the filling,
  making sure it touches the edges of the crust all around.

           Macadamia Crumb Crust and
           Topping-
      1 c  Finely chopped macadamia
           Pieces
  1 1/4 c  Unbleached, allpurpose
           Flour
    1/8 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
      1    Stick unsalted butter,
           Melted and cooled
           Macadamia Rum Filling:
  1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
    1/3 c  Water
  1 1/2    Envelopes unflavored
           Gelatin
      4    Egg yolks
    1/3 c  Dark rum
    1/2 c  Light brown sugar
    1/2 c  Chopped, toasted macadamias
      1 c  Heavy cream, for finishing,
           Optional
 
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
  
  For the crumb crust: combine the nuts, flour, salt, sugar, and
  cinnamon in a mixing bowl, and stir to mix well. Stir in the melted
  butter and continue stirring until the mixture has absorbed the
  butter. Break the mixture into even 1/2 to 1/4 inch crumbs, rubbing
  with the fingertips. Place half the crumb mixture into a 9 inch Pyrex
  pie pan and press with the fingertips to line the pan evenly. Place
  the remaining crumb mixture, in an even 1/2 inch layer on a cookie
  sheet. Bake the crust and crumbs on the middle rack of the oven about
  20 minutes, until crisp and light golden in color. Cool the crust and
  crumbs on racks.
  
  For the Mousse Filling: Whip the cream until it holds soft peaks and
  set it aside in the refrigerator. Sprinkle the gelatin on the water
  in a small, heatproof bowl. Allow to soak 5 minutes, then place over
  a small pan of simmering water to melt while preparing the filling.
  
  When the gelatin is melted, remove from the pan and allow to cool.
  
  In the bowl of an electric mixer, or another heatproof bowl, whisk
  the egg yolks. Whisk in the rum, then the sugar. Place over a pan of
  gently simmering water and whisk constantly until thickened, about 3
  minutes. If the yolk mixture becomes too hot, it may scramble.
  
  Remove the bowl from the water and beat by machine, on medium speed,
  until cooled to room temperature. Whisk in the dissolved gelatin,
  then fold in the whipped cream and the chopped nuts.
  
  Pour the filling into the cooled shell and smooth the top. Cover
  loosely with plastic wrap and chill until set at least 6 hours.
  
  To finish the pie, top with the baked crumbs. Or whip the optional
  cream, spread half on the mousse and top with the crumbs. Then, pipe
  a border of rosettes of the remaining cream around the edge of the
  pie with a pastry bag fitted with a star tube.

  yellow and thick ribbons. Mix in the yogurt, then the olive oil. With
  a spatula, fold in the reserved flour mixture.
  
  Beat the egg whites to soft peaks, add remaining 3/4 cup sugar and
  beat to stiff peaks. Fold egg whites into the batter. Pour batter
  into prepared pan and bake 45 to 55 minutes, or until done. Cool on a
  rack, remove from pan and serve with drained yogurt, honey and
  chopped pistachios.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
    3/4 c  Cold water
  1 1/2 ts Sugar (more or less
           Depending on sweetness
           Desired)
      3 tb Freshly ground medium roast
           Coffee
 
  Combine all ingredients in the cezve and mix with a spoon. Put the
  cezve over very low heat and do not stir. After about 3 minutes, a
  thick foam rises to the surface. Just as the coffee is about to
  bubble up and overflow, immediately remove the cezve from the heat.
  Gently divide the foam between 2 demitasse cups, then place the cezve
  back on the heat for a few seconds. Pour the coffee into the cups,
  carefully pouring it down the sides of the cups in order not to
  disturb the foam. The coffee grains will settle at the bottom of the
  cup.

    1/2 c  Frozen organic peas
     16    Mussels, cleaned
           Garlic aioli (recipe

  Place the shrimp, fish and squid in a colander, sprinkle with coarse
  salt and let sit while preparing the remaining ingredients. Combine
  the stock, saffron, and wine in a saucepan, and bring to a boil while
  cooking fish.
  
  Heat the olive oil in a wide paella pan set over two burners. Add the
  shrimp, fish, and squid, and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
  Remove the shrimp and fish, leaving the squid in the pan. Add the
  peppers to the pan, and saute 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and
  saute another minute to release the aromas. Stir in the paprika and
  tomatoes, and saute 1 minute to release the aromas. Add the rice,
  toss to coat it with the tomato mixture, and stir in the parsley and
  bay leaves.
  
  Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  Add the hot broth to the pan, along with the peas. Boil for 5 to 10
  minutes, or until some of the liquid reduces. (Paella should have just
  enough liquid to cook rice, but not be soupy). Adjust seasonings.
  Stir in the reserved shrimp and fish, and arrange the mussels over
  the paella with the edges that will open facing up.
  
  Transfer paella pan to the oven and cook, uncovered, for 10 to 12
  minutes, or until rice is almost cooked and most of the liquid is
  absorbed.
  
  Remove paella from oven, cover loosely, and let sit for 10 minutes

      Title: Crispy Bottomed Basmati Rice With Lentils
 Categories: 2hot
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 c  Basmati rice
      2 tb Plus 1 teaspoon sea salt
      4 tb Extravirgin olive oil
      1 lg Onion, finely diced
      2 c  Brown lentils, washed and
           Drained
      4    To 5 garlic cloves, minced
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1 ts Hungarian paprika
      1 bn Fresh basil, leaves
           Julienned
 
  Wash the rice in several changes of warm water until the water runs
  clear. Soak the rice for 6 to 8 hours or overnight, in cold water to
  cover, with 1 tablespoon of the salt. (Alternatively, to save time,
  soak the rice in lukewarm water with the salt for 30 to 45 minutes.)
  
  Heat a large, heavybottomed skillet over medium heat. Add 2
  tablespoons of the olive oil and the onion. Cook until the onion
  becomes translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the lentils, garlic,
  pepper, and paprika. Continue cooking 2 minutes. Add 2 cups of water,
  cover, and cook until tender, about 45 minutes. Season with the 1
  teaspoon salt, or to taste. Stir in the basil.
  
  In a large saucepan, over mediumhigh heat, bring 2 1/2 quarts of
  water to a boil with the remaining 1 tablespoon of salt.
  
  Drain the rice from the soaking liquid and add it to the boiling
  water. Return to a boil and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, uncovered,
  stirring occasionally. Test a grain of rice for doneness; it should
  be cooked entirely except for a small part in the center.
  
  Strain the rice in a colander and rinse with warm water. Drain well.
  
  Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large,
  wellseasoned or nonstick stock pot with a tightfitting lid, over
  medium heat. Add about 2 tablespoons water and sprinkle the cooked
  rice evenly onto the bottom of the pot a spoonful at a time until
  twothirds of the rice has been distributed. Spread the lentil mixture
  evenly over the rice. Cover the lentils with the remaining rice,
  mounding it slightly in the center.
  
  Use the handle of a wooden spoon to poke about 5 deep holes in the
  rice from the surface of rice to the bottom of the pot to allow steam
  to escape. Cover the pot with a thick cotton dish towel and place the
  lid on tightly.
  
  Reduce the heat to mediumlow and cook for 35 to 40 minutes, turning
  the pot occasionally.
  
  Fill the sink with cold water 1 or 2 inches deep.
  
  Remove the cover from the rice and have a large, round platter ready.
  
  Place the pot in the sink for 1 minute, watching so that no water
  enters the pot. Remove the pot and dry off the bottom, then invert
  the rice cake onto the platter. It should unmold itself in one piece
  and be golden brown.
  
  Bring the platter to the table and serve family style. Cut individual
  wedges from the rice cake, similar to cutting a pie.

  Clean the beans, removing all stones or chaff. Rinse them well. In a
  pot large enough to hold the beans plus water to cover, let them soak,
  overnight.
  
  In a mediumsize saucepan, over medium heat, saute the salt pork just
  until it begins to brown. Add the onions and chiles and continue to
  cook until soft, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and continue to
  cook, about 1 to 2 minutes.

  of the saucepan to the pot of beans. Bring to a boil, then reduce the
  heat. Simmer, covered, for 1 1/2 hours. Add the salt and simmer,

  carefully, and stir once or twice to be sure they do not stick to the
  bottom of the pan.
  
  Remove 1 cup of the beans, place them in a blender, and blend until
  smooth. Stir them back into the pot along with the sherry. Add

      6    Very thin slices country
           Bread
      8    Cumin seeds
      8    Saffron threads
      6    Eggs (optional)

  garlic head in a large pot. Add enough water to cover, about 1
  gallon, and bring to a boil. Skim and discard foam that rises to the
  top. Reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, about 1 hour,
  periodically skimming foam from the top. If liquid is evaporating too
  rapidly, add a cup or two of water. Strain by lifting liquid out with
  a ladle. Discard the onion and garlic, and set aside to cool. Reserve
  2 quarts for the soup, and save the extra for another use. (It will
  keep in the refrigerator up to 5 days).

  minced garlic, and saute until golden. Add the cured ham, and saute
  for a minute. Add the tomato and paprika, and saute briefly, then add
  the reserved chicken stock. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer
  for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, toast the bread, rub half a clove of the
  remaining 3 garlic cloves over each piece, and drizzle with the
  remaining olive oil. With a mortar and pestle, pound the leftover
  garlic halves, cumin seeds, and saffron. Stir paste into the
  simmering soup, and add the bread, breaking it up a bit.

      1    Sweet dried red romesco
           Pepper, (or substitute a
           Roasted red bell
           Pepper)
      1 sl Bread, toasted
     10    Blanched almonds, toasted

    1/3 c  Olive oil
      1    To 2 tablespoons warm water
     12    To 16 knob onions, or
           Calcots
 
  Prepare the romesco sauce: If using a dried pepper, remove the stem
  and seeds from the pepper and soak in warm water for 1 hour, or until
  softened. Scrape off the flesh and discard skin. If using a roasted
  pepper, remove the charred skin, stem, and seeds, and chop. Set aside.

  temperature or chill until ready to serve.
  
  Preheat a grill or broiler, and preheat an oven to 400 degrees F.
  Trim the roots off the onions and spread them over the grill. Grill

      Title: Orange Cake
 Categories: 2hot
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 lg Eggs
  1 1/4 c  Sugar
      1 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Olive oil
           Zest of 1 orange, minced
  1 3/4 c  Flour, sifted
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
           SYRUP:
      1    Orange
  1 1/2 c  Orange juice
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
 
  Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F. Butter an 8-inch cake pan, then
  dust with sugar and flour.
  
  Beat the eggs with the sugar to pale yellow ribbons. Beat in the
  milk, oil and orange zest. In a small bowl, sift the flour with the
  baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the flour mixture to the
  egg mixture a tablespoon at a time, stirring well after each addition.
  
  Pour batter into prepared cake pan and bake for 1 hour. Remove cake
  from oven, let cool slightly on a rack, then invert and cool
  completely. Meanwhile, prepare the syrup: Use a sharp paring knife to
  cut the orange rind off the orange used for zest and the remaining
  orange, leaving the bitter white pith on the orange. Cut the skin
  into very thin strips and reserve. Cut away and discard the white
  pith, remove the orange supremes, and reserve.
  
  In a large saucepan, combine the orange juice, sugar, and thin orange
  strips. Bring to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes, or until a thick
  syrup. Strain the syrup and reserve the orange strips, along with 1/2
  cup of the syrup. Use a toothpick to poke holes in the top of the
  cake, then pour the warm strained syrup all over the cake so that it
  soaks through.
  
  Place the remaining 1/2 cup syrup in a small saucepan, bring to a
  simmer and reduce to a few tablespoons. Use a spatula to spread the
  thick glaze over the top of the cake. Place cake on a serving
  platter, and arrange the reserved orange strips and orange supremes
  on top of the cake.
  
  Yield: 1 (8-inch) cake; 4 to 6 servings

 Categories: 2hot
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Almond Cream-
    1/4 c  Unsalted butter, softened
    1/3 c  Super fine sugar
      2 lg Egg yolks
    1/4 ts Amaretto or almond extract
      1 c  Ground almonds (see note)
      1 tb Allpurpose flour
           Caramel Sauce:
    1/2 c  Brown sugar, packed
      4 tb Unsalted butter
      2 tb Heavy cream
           Tarts:
      1 lb Puff pastry
      2 lg Ripe pears, peeled, cored,
           And thinly sliced
      1    Egg yolk
      4    Sprigs mint
           Confectioners sugar, for
           Serving
 
  To make the almond cream: In the bowl of an electric mixer or with a
  wooden spoon, beat the butter and sugar together until light and
  fluffy. Add the egg yolks, beat in well, and add the Amaretto. Stir
  in the ground almonds and flour until evenly mixed. The mixture
  should be the consistency of a thick paste.
  
  To make the caramel sauce: In a small sauce pan, combine the brown
  sugar, butter and cream. Bring the mixture to a boil and boil
  vigorously for 2 minutes, remove from the heat. Cover and keep warm
  at the back of the stove.
  
  To make the tarts: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. On a lightly
  floured surface, roll out the pastry to a 1/8 inch thickness and,
  using a plate or cardboard circle as a template, use a very sharp
  knife to cut four 7 inch circles. Spread a circle of almond cream in
  the center of each, leaving a 1inch border. Fan the sliced pears out
  from the center of each tart, completely covering the almond cream
  but still leaving the border. Beat the egg yolk lightly with a fork
  and brush the border of the pastry with it (try not to let any yolk
  dribble down onto the cut edges of the pastry, otherwise it will not
  rise as high). Bake the tarts for about 20 minutes, until the edges
  are golden and the pastry is baked through. Remove from the oven and
  allow to cool for 5 minutes Place a sprig of mint in the center of
  each tart and sprinkle it with a little confectioners sugar. Serve
  warm, drizzled with the warm caramel sauce.
  
  Yield: 4 servings
  
  Note: to make ground almonds, freeze whole or sliced blanched
  almonds, then process them in a blender in short bursts, scraping
  down the sides as necessary, until they are evenly ground. Do not
  over process or allow them to get warm, otherwise they will turn into
  nut butter.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2    Whole chicken breasts
      1    Head iceberg lettuce,
           Trimmed, washed, and dried
      1    Head romaine, trimmed,
           Washed, and dried
      1 bn Watercress
      1 bn Chicory
      4 tb Chopped chives
      4 md Tomatoes, peeled and seeded
      2    Ripe avocados
      1 lb Bacon
      6    Hard-boiled eggs
      2 c  Finely grated Roquefort
           Cheese
      2 c  Cobb's Old Fashioned French
           Dressing (recipe follows)
 
  Place the chicken breasts in a shallow pan or deep skillet and cover
  by about one inch with cold water. Bring to a simmer over medium heat,
  maintain the heat at a simmer, and poach the breasts for 10 to 12
  minutes, depending on their size. Remove the pan from the heat and
  allow the chicken to cool to room temperature. When the chicken is
  cool, remove it from the stock (which can be strained and used for
  another purpose), remove and discard the skin and bones, and chop the
  meat finely.
  
  Meanwhile, cook the bacon until it is crisp. Drain the bacon well and
  chop in roughly, by hand or in a food processor. Place the chopped
  bacon on paper towels and dry further, in a conventional oven on a
  low heat or in a microwave oven, until it separates into bits. This
  process may need to be repeated 2 or 3 times, depending on the fat
  content of the bacon used.
  
  Place the Roquefort cheese in the freezer for about 15 minutes; then
  remove the cheese from the freezer and grate it, using a cheese or
  vegetable grater. Cut the tomatoes into small dice and sprinkle with
  salt and pepper. Halve, peel, and dice the avocados; sprinkle with
  salt and fresh lemon juice. Using a food processor, chop the greens
  finely, into 3/16 inch bits, but do not reduce them to mush. Finely
  chop the hard boiled eggs.
  
  To assemble the salad, place all the greens in a large bowl and toss
  them together; spread the greens evenly in the bottom of the bowl.
  Arrange the bacon, egg, chicken, tomato, and cheese in strips across
  the greens; arrange the chopped avocado around the edge of the salad.
  Bring the salad to the table with the dressing alongside and toss
  together just before serving.
  
  Note: The ingredients can be prepared several hours in advance,
  covered, and kept in the refrigerator; remove the ingredients about
  15 minutes before assembling the salad.

           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  Trim the chicken of all fat and, if pieces are thicker than 3/8 of an
  inch, pound them between sheets of plastic or waxed paper until they
  are more uniformly even. Combine half of the lime juice with the
  ground cumin and salt and rub this over the chicken. Preheat the
  broiler or grill. Start to grill the chicken and cook for about 6
  minutes a side or until just cooked through. Combine the avocados
  with the mangoes, cucumbers and remaining lime juice. Season with
  salt and pepper. When the chicken is cooked through, remove the
  pieces to a cutting board to cool slightly and, in a blender or food
  processor, puree the vegetable oil, cilantro, scallion with white
  wine vinegar or Verges and season well with salt and pepper. To
  serve, cut the chicken, across the grain, on a diagonal, into thin
  slices. Spoon about 1 1/2 cups of mango and avocado mix on each
  dinner plate. Center the chicken slices over the mango salad and
  spoon the cilantro vinaigrette over the chicken. Serve at room
  temperature.

  Place beans in a small saucepan and cover with a generous amount of
  water. Bring to a boil and cook, covered, until beans are tender,
  about 1 hour. Drain and reserve. (To test a bean for doneness, choose
  a small one. Smaller beans take longer to cook because of their dense
  centers. The bean should taste creamy, rather than powdery, inside.)
  
  Make Pesto by pureeing garlic, olive oil, and a few basil leaves in a
  blender. Gradually add remaining leaves until all are pureed.
  Transfer to a small bowl, add grated cheese, and stir. Set aside.Cut
  each vegetable into even 1/2inch dice and set aside. To avoid
  discoloration, reserve potatoes in a bowl of cold water.
  
  Bring chicken stock to a boil in a large stockpot. Add white beans,
  potatoes, carrot, and onion. Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and
  cook, uncovered, 15 minutes. Add remaining vegetables and bring back
  to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook an additional 10 minutes,
  uncovered. Season to taste. Serve soup with a dollop of pesto in each
  bowl.

      1    Cup finely chopped basil

  water. Place a colander in the water. Crumble the cheese curd into
  the water. Using a wooden spoon, stir the mixture until the curd
  starts to pull. Using your hands or a spoon, pull the cheese until it
  begins to hold shape. It's like pulling taffy. Do not over pull the
  cheese because the end product will be rubbery. It is like you are
  pulling taffy. If the cheese hardens to soon, dip the cheese back in
  the water and repeat the pulling process. After the desired weight is
  achieved dip the cheese in an ice bath. The cheese can either be
  stored in salted water or rolled in plastic wrap. If you want to
  flavor the cheese, add the flavorings during the pulling process. Rub
  your hands with the herbs and garlic and work them into the cheese.

 Categories: Taste
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Butter
  2 2/3 c  Sifted flour
      5 tb White Creme de Menthe
      2 ts Black peppercorns, crushed
     10    Egg whites
        pn Salt
    1/2 ts Baking powder
  1 1/3 c  Sugar, plus 4 tablespoons
    3/4 c  Coarsely ground pistachio
           Nuts
 
  Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 10-inch loaf pan and dust with
  flour.
  
  Cream butter with 1 1/3 cups of the flour until light and fluffy.
  Beat in Creme de Menthe and black peppercorns until well-incorporated.
  
  In a bowl, blend 8 of the egg whites, the salt and the baking powder.
  Beat until the egg whites hold soft peaks. Continue beating, adding 1
  1/3 cups of sugar, a tablespoon at a time, until the egg whites are
  very stiff.
  
  Stir 1/4 of the egg white mixture into the creamed butter-flour
  mixture, blending thoroughly with a wooden spoon. Pour this mixture
  back over the remaining egg whites. Start sprinkling in the remaining
  1 1/3 cups of flour while gently folding the butter-flour mixture
  into the egg whites. The less the mixture is manipulated, the lighter
  the cake will be.
  
  Pour into prepared pan. Bake for 40 minutes. While baking, mix
  together the pistachio nuts, the 2 remaining egg whites and the
  remaining 4 tablespoons of sugar. Remove the loaf from the oven after
  30 minutes. Spread the pistachio nut mixture over the top. If the
  loaf has cracked at all on top, let the pistachio mixture seep into
  the cracks. If the loaf hasn't cracked, make a few shallow slits on
  top to let the pistachio mixture seep in. Continue baking until a
  cake tester comes out clean, and the loaf is starting to pull away
  from the pan (about 20-30 minutes). Turn out on a rack and let cool
  for one hour.
  
  The lightness, dryness and low-sweetness of this pound cake is
  perfect for lightly sweet Champagne.

  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      1 c  All-purpose flour (spoon
           Flour into cup and level off
           With the back
           A knife)
     10 tb (1 1/4 sticks) unsalted
           Butter
      2 tb Dark rum
      2 ts Vanilla extract
      1 c  Large egg whites, about 8
        pn Salt
    1/4 c  Sliced or chopped hazelnuts,
           About 1-ounce
           Confectioners' sugar for
           Finishing
           Plum Compote:
      2 lb Prune plums
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Lemon juice
      3 tb Unsalted butter
    1/4 c  Water
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
           Garnish:
           Creme Fraiche
 
  One 10-inch springform or layer pan, buttered and the bottom lined
  with a disk of parchment or waxed paper, or 12 4-inch individual
  pans, buttered. Set a rack at the middle level of the oven and
  preheat to 350 degrees. Place the hazelnuts and 3/4 cup of the sugar
  in a food processor and pulse until the mixture is finely ground.
  Transfer to a bowl and stir in the flour.  Melt the butter in a
  medium saucepan over medium heat. Continue cooking the butter until
  it colors slightly, swirling the pan to color it evenly. Remove from
  heat and add the rum and vanilla extract. Set aside to cool slightly.
  In a clean, dry bowl, whip the egg whites with the salt until they
  form a very soft peak.  Add the remaining 3/4 cup sugar in a very
  slow stream, whipping constantly.  Continue whipping the egg whites
  until they hold a soft peak.  Alternately fold the hazelnut and
  butter mixtures into the egg whites, 1/3 at a time. Begin with the
  hazelnut mixture and end with the butter.  Pour the batter into the
  prepared pan or pans.  Smooth the top and sprinkle with the sliced or
  chopped hazelnuts. Bake the financier for about 50 minutes until well
  risen and golden, about 30 minutes for the individual cakes. The
  center of the cake should feel firm when pressed with the palm of the
  hand. Cool the financier briefly on a rack and remove pan and paper.
  If some of the hazelnuts on the surface fall off, replace them on the
  cake.  Dust very lightly with confectioners' sugar.  For the compote,
  rinse, pit and quarter plums. Combine sugar and lemon juice in a
  small pan and heat until sugar begins to melt. Stir occasionally
  until sugar turns to a deep amber caramel. Add butter and water
  carefully off heat to prevent splattering. Return to heat, bring to a
  boil and add plums.  Simmer a minute or two, add cinnamon and cool.
  To serve, place a financier off center on a plate and spoon plum
  compote next to it.  Top with Creme Fraiche.
  
  Makes one 10-inch cake, about 12 servings, or 12 individual cakes

  1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
    1/2 ts Allspice
      2 ts Ground cinnamon
      2 ts Baking soda
    2/3 c  Vegetable shortening
  2 1/3 c  Sugar
      4    Eggs
      2 c  Applesauce
      1 c  Chopped walnuts
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease twelve 1/2-pint wide-mouth
  canning jars with a paper towel dipped in shortening.
  
  Sift flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and
  baking soda into a large bowl. Using the electric mixer and a medium
  mixing bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar on low speed,
  then increase to medium speed to mix well. While the mixer is
  running, add the eggs, one at a time. Stop the mixer and scrape down
  the sides. Remove the bowl from the mixer and stir in the applesauce.
  With a large spoon, stir in the sifted flour mixture and the walnuts.
  Pour the batter into a measuring cup with a spout; pour the batter
  neatly into the greased jars. Fill the jars halfway full. Place the
  filled jars on the sheet tray and bake on the center rack of the oven
  for 45 minutes. When done, the top of the cake will spring back when
  pressed with a finger, and the sides will have come away from the jar.
  
  Remove from oven and let cool 10 to 15 minutes. Cake will still be
  warm, but not hot. Place a circle of waxed paper on top of the jar
  and seal with the jar lid. Pack carefully so as not to break the
  glass.

      Title: Clafouti
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Milk
      1 c  Heavy cream
    1/2    Vanilla bean
      2    Cinnamon sticks
      1    Heaping tablespoon
           All-purpose flour
    3/4 c  Sugar
      6    Eggs
      1 ts Minced lemon zest
      1 pt Raspberries
      1 pt Blueberries
      1    Prebaked tart shell (recipe
           Follows)
 
  Heat milk and cream with vanilla bean and cinnamon sticks. Scald and
  let cool, then strain out vanilla bean and cinnamon sticks. Into
  strained mixture, whisk in flour, sugar, eggs and lemon zest and
  transfer mixture to a pitcher or a pour spout.
  
  Assemble berries in pre-baked, room-temperature tart shell.
  Raspberries should be top down (with opening down). Tightly packed
  but only one layer of fruit.
  
  Pour just enough batter over berries to almost come up even with
  fruit. Be careful not to put too much, but enough to fill in all the
  spaces and come 5/6ths of the way up the berries.
  
  Bake 15 to 20 minutes at 350 degrees until set and slightly brown on
  top.

  TART SHELL
  
  6 tablespoons butter
      1/2    cup confectioners' sugar 2 large egg yolks 1 egg, beaten
  (divide into two equal parts, save half for recipe, discard remaining
  half or save for another use) 2 cups all-purpose flour
      1/8    teaspoon vanilla 1 beaten egg white
  
  Cream butter and sugar in a mixer with paddle. Slowly add egg yolks,
  beaten egg half, and vanilla. Add flour and mix until just combined.
  Wrap in plastic wrap and chill at least 2 hours. Remove from
  refrigerator, unwrap and roll on a floured surface into a 3/8-inch
  thick circle. Drape into an 11 or 12-inch tart pan and press into
  corners. Line pastry with parchment paper and fill with dried beans
  or pie weights and bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes until light
  brown. While still warm, remove weights and parchment paper and brush
  slightly with a beaten egg white, taking care not to use too much and
  to only brush the inside of the shell. Let tart shell rest at room
  temperature until ready to fill.

      Title: Buttermilk Panna Cotta With Lemon Jelly
 Categories: Live
      Yield: 4 servings
 
           For panna cotta-
      2 c  Buttermilk
  1 1/2 ts Powdered unflavored gelatin
    2/3 c  Heavy cream
    1/2 c  Sugar
           For jelly:
    1/2 c  Fresh lemon juice
    1/2 pk Powdered unflavored gelatin
    1/4 c  Sugar
 
  Make panna cotta:
  
  Pour 1 cup of buttermilk into the top of a double boiler (not over
  heat). Sprinkle gelatin over the buttermilk, let stand to soften,
  about 5 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, bring cream and scant 1/2 cup sugar
  to a boil. Add cream mixture to the gelatin mixture; place over
  simmering water; whisk until the gelatin dissolves, about 5 minutes.
  Stir in the remaining cup of buttermilk. Pass the mixture through a
  cheesecloth-lined strainer. Divide among six 4-ounce ramekins or
  small bowls on a baking sheet. Cover; refrigerate until set, about 4
  hours.
  
  Make jelly:
  
  Place 1/4 cup of the lemon juice in a mixing bowl. Sprinkle the
  gelatin over the lemon juice and let stand to soften, about 5 minutes.
  
  In a small pan bring the sugar and 1 cup of water to a boil over high
  heat. Pour the syrup over the gelatin mixture, whisk to dissolve. Add
  the remaining 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Allow the mixture to return to
  room temperature.
  
  Once the buttermilk panna cotta has set, pour a 1/4-inch-thin layer of
  lemon jelly on top of each ramekin. Refrigerate until set, about 30
  minutes. The panna cotta ramekins can be prepared up to 24 hours in
  advance, covered and refrigerated. Serve chilled and garnish with
  lemon sorbet and crispy cookies.
  
  Yield: 6 servings
