--------  ------------  --------------------------------
                        ***PLUM FILLING***
   2      pounds        black or red plums
     1/3  cup           water
     1/3  cup           amaretto
     1/4  cup           granulated sugar
                        ***SHORTCAKES***
   1      cup           all-purpose flour
   1      cup           cake flour
   5      tablespoons   granulated sugar
   2      teaspoons     baking powder
   1      teaspoon      baking soda
     1/2  teaspoon      salt
     1/4  cup           almond paste
     3/4  cup           buttermilk -- plus 1 tablespoon
   1      tablespoon    canola oil
   1      teaspoon      pure vanilla extract
     1/3  cup           sliced almonds
                        mascarpone cream

TO MAKE PLUM FILLING:

Pit plums and cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. In a saucepan, combine water, Amaretto and sugar. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add plums, return to a simmer and cook until plums start to soften, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature.

TO MAKE & ASSEMBLE SHORTCAKES:

1. Preheat oven to 425°F. Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat it with nonstick spray.

2. In a mixing bowl, whisk all-purpose and cake flours, 3 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Using a pastry blender or your fingers, cut almond paste into dry ingredients until mixture resembles fine meal.

3. In a glass measuring cup, combine 3/4 cup buttermilk, oil and vanilla. Make a well in the dry ingredients. Add wet ingredients and stir with a fork until just combined. (Dough will be slightly sticky; do not overmix.)

4. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently pat into a 3/4-inch-thick circle. With a floured 3 or 3 1/2-inch cutter, cut out shortcakes and place on prepared baking sheet. Press dough scraps together and repeat to make 8 shortcakes.

5. In a small bowl, toss almonds with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and remaining 1 tablespoon buttermilk. Lightly press mixture onto shortcakes.

6. Bake shortcakes for 10 to 12 minutes, or until light golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly.

7. To serve, split shortcakes in half with a serrated knife. Set bottoms on dessert plates. Spoon on plum filling and mascarpone cream. Set tops on at an angle. Serve immediately.

Makes 8 servings.

   1      large         egg -- lightly beaten
     2/3  cups          packed brown sugar
     1/2  cup           apple butter
     1/3  cup           pure maple syrup -- divided
                        --plus 1/4 to 1/3 cup
     1/3  cup           apple cider
     1/3  cup           nonfat plain yogurt
   3      tablespoons   canola oil
   1 1/4  cup           confectioners' sugar
   1      teaspoon      vanilla extract

1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Coat the molds of a mini-bundt pan with nonstick cooking spray. Sprinkle with granulated sugar, shaking out excess.

2. In mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon; set aside. In another bowl, whisk together egg, brown sugar, apple butter, 1/3 cup maple syrup, cider, yogurt and oil. Add dry ingredients and stir until just moistened. Divide half the batter among the prepared molds, spooning about 2 generous tablespoonfuls of batter into each mold.

3. Bake 10 to 12 minutes, until tops spring back when lightly touched. Loosen edges and turn cakes out onto wire rack to cool. Clean the mini-bundt pan, then recoat it with cooking spray or oil and sugar Repeat with remaining batter.

4. In bowl, combine confectioners' sugar and vanilla. Gradually whisk in the remaining 1/4 to 1/3 cup maple syrup to obtain a coating consistency. Dip fluted side of "doughnuts" in glaze to coat. Set glazed side up on a wire rack over waxed paper for a few minutes until glaze sets.

Note: Coating a mold or cake pan with sugar before adding the batter will give the outside of the cake an appealing crisp glaze. A mini-bundt pan produces doughnut-shaped cakes, but if you do not have one, you can use a regular bundt pan and make a coffee cake; bake it in a 375°F oven 25 to 30 minutes.

Makes 12 servings. Preparation time: 30 minutes. Baking time: 1 hour.

                              Caramel Sauce

Serving Size  : 16   Preparation Time :0:00

--------  ------------  --------------------------------
     1/4  cup           chopped pecans or walnuts -- optional
     3/4  cup           granulated sugar
     1/3  cup           water
     1/3  cup           double-strength brewed coffee
                        --or 2 teaspoons instant coffee -- dissolved in
     1/3  cup           hot water
   1      tablespoon    butter
     1/4  cup           evaporated skim milk
     1/2  teaspoon      pure vanilla extract

1. If using nuts, toast them in a small dry skillet over low heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside.

2. In a 2-quart heavy saucepan, combine sugar and water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve sugar. Once it starts boiling, cook without stirring until syrup turns amber, 5 to 10 minutes.

3. Remove from heat and carefully pour in coffee. (Stand back, as caramel may sputter.) Let stand for 2 minutes. Return to low heat and whisk until caramel has dissolved. Remove from heat.

4. Swirl butter into caramel mixture. Gradually whisk in milk. Stir in vanilla and toasted nuts, if using. Let cool. (The sauce will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.)

Makes about 1 cup.

     1/2  teaspoon      cream of tartar
     1/4  cup           sugar

Make a collar for a 2-quart soufflé dish: Cut a strip of foil long enough to go around the dish plus 6 inches. Fold foil lengthwise into thirds, making a 4-inch-wide strip. Spray one side of strip with nonstick coating. Place strip, coated side in, around the outside of the soufflé dish so it extends about 2 inches above the rim. Pull tight and secure with tape where the foil overlaps.

Place egg product in a medium mixing bowl; set aside. Combine 1/4 cup sugar, cocoa powder, and cornstarch in a medium saucepan. Add evaporated skim milk all at once. Cook and stir over medium heat till mixture is thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more (mixture will be very thick). Using a whisk and stirring constantly, gradually stir chocolate mixture into egg product. Stir in rum or rum flavoring. Set aside to cool while beating egg whites.

Beat egg whites and cream of tartar in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed till soft peaks form (tips curl). Add 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating on high speed till stiff peaks form (tips stand straight). Fold a small amount of beaten egg white mixture into chocolate mixture to lighten it. Fold chocolate mixture into remaining beaten egg whites. Turn mixture into prepared soufflé dish.

Bake in a 350°F oven for 45 to 50 minutes or till a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Remove collar. Serve immediately.

                        ***BLUEBERRY FILLING***
   4      cups          fresh blueberries
     1/2  cup           water
     1/3  cup           granulated sugar
   1      teaspoon      pure vanilla extract
                        ***SHORTCAKES***
   1      cup           all-purpose flour
   1      cup           yellow cornmeal
                        --preferably stone-ground
     1/4  cup           granulated sugar -- plus 1 tablespoon
   2      teaspoons     baking powder
   1      teaspoon      baking soda
     1/2  teaspoon      salt
     1/4  cup           reduced-fat cream cheese
     3/4  cup           buttermilk -- plus 2 tablespoons
   1      tablespoon    canola oil
   1      teaspoon      pure vanilla extract
   2      tablespoons   chopped pecans
                        lemon curd
                        --see recipe

TO MAKE BLUEBERRY FILLING:

In a saucepan, combine 2 cups blueberries, water and sugar. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until berries soften into a sauce, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in remaining 2 cups blueberries and vanilla. Set aside. (The filling will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 1 day.)

TO MAKE & ASSEMBLE SHORTCAKES:

1. Preheat oven to 425°F. Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat it with nonstick spray.

2. In a mixing bowl, whisk flour, cornmeal, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Using a pastry blender or your fingers, cut cream cheese into dry ingredients until mixture resembles coarse meal.

3. In a glass measuring cup, combine 3/4 cup buttermilk, oil and vanilla. Make a well in the dry ingredients. Add wet ingredients and stir with a fork until just combined. (Dough will be slightly sticky; do not overmix.)

4. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently pat into a 3/4-inch-thick circle. With a floured knife, cut dough into 8 triangles; place on prepared baking sheet.

5. In a small bowl, combine pecans and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Brush shortcake tops with remaining 2 tablespoons buttermilk and sprinkle with pecan mixture.

6. Bake shortcakes for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly.

7. To serve, split shortcakes in half with a serrated knife. Set bottoms on dessert plates. Spoon on blueberry filling and lemon curd. Set tops on at an angle. Serve immediately.

                    Cornmeal-Pumpkin Dessert Souffles

Recipe By     : Eating Well, October 1997
Serving Size  : 6    Preparation Time :0:00
Categories    : Desserts

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   2      cups          1% milk
     1/2  cup           granulated sugar -- plus 6 teaspoons
   1      piece         orange zest
                        --3 by 1 inch
     1/2  cup           yellow cornmeal
     2/3  cup           canned pumpkin puree
     1/4  teaspoon      ground nutmeg
   4      large         egg whites
     1/4  teaspoon      salt
                        confectioners' sugar -- for dusting

1. In a large heavy saucepan, combine milk, 1/4 cup sugar and orange zest; bring to a simmer over medium heat. Discard orange zest. Whisking constantly, add cornmeal in a thin, steady stream. Cook, whisking, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Whisk in pumpkin puree and nutmeg. Simmer, stirring constantly, until very thick, about 10 minutes.

2. Scrape mixture into a large mixing bowl. Place a sheet of plastic wrap directly over the surface. Let cool to room temperature, about 45 minutes. (The soufflé base will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Before continuing, bring to room temperature: place bowl over a pan of simmering water or microwave at medium power for 1 to 2 minutes.)

3. Preheat oven to 400°F. Lightly oil six 8-ounce soufflé dishes or ramekins or coat them with nonstick spray. Coat the inside of each dish with 1 teaspoon sugar, tapping out the excess. Line a small roasting pan with a folded kitchen towel. Put a large kettle of water on to boil.

4. Shortly before serving, in a large mixing bowl, combine egg whites and salt; beat with an electric mixer at high speed until foamy and opaque, forming very soft peaks. Add remaining 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating constantly until slightly firm peaks form.

5. Whisk one-fourth of the egg whites into pumpkin mixture until smooth. With a rubber spatula, gently fold in remaining whites. Divide among prepared dishes.

6. Place dishes in prepared pan. Pour in enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the dishes. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, or until well risen and golden. Remove from pan. Dust with confectioners' sugar. Serve immediately.

   2      teaspoons     pure vanilla extract
   1 1/2  cup           brandy
     1/3  cup           sliced dried mission figs

1. Preheat oven to 325°F. Spread bread cubes in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart shallow baking dish.

2. In a medium bowl, whisk whole eggs and egg white until frothy; set aside. In a saucepan, combine skim milk, sweetened condensed milk and 1 tablespoon sugar. Stir over medium heat until quite hot but not boiling. Remove from the heat and stir in vanilla. Gradually whisk the hot milk into the eggs. Pour the mixture onto the bread cubes, pressing down with a spoon to make sure the cubes are fully soaked.

3. Set the baking dish in a roasting pan. Add enough boiling water to come halfway up the outside of the smaller dish. Place in the oven and bake until the top is lightly golden and the custard is set in the center, 40 to 50 minutes.

4. Meanwhile, combine brandy, 1/4 cup sugar, figs and 1/3 cup water in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over low heat. Cover and simmer gently for 10 minutes. Uncover and simmer until reduced to 1 cup, about 20 minutes. Serve the brandied figs warm over the bread pudding.

                        nonstick cooking spray
     1/2  cup           granulated sugar -- plus
   2      tablespoons   granulated sugar -- divided , (up to 3)
   2      tablespoons   cornstarch -- divided
   1      cup           skim milk -- divided
   1      tablespoon    grated lemon zest

   1      teaspoon      pure vanilla extract
   2      teaspoons     low-fat milk -- (up to 3)

1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Thoroughly coat the molds of 2 mini-Bundt pans with nonstick cooking spray or oil. Sprinkle molds evenly with 2 tablespoons of the granulated sugar, shaking out excess. (If you only have one pan, bake the recipe in 2 batches.)

2. In a mixing bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt.

3. In another bowl, whisk egg and egg white until frothy. Add brown sugar and the remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar; whisk until smooth. Add yogurt or buttermilk, oil and vanilla and whisk until blended. Add the dry ingredients and stir with a rubber spatula just until moistened.

4. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of batter into each prepared mold, smoothing the surfaces with a small spoon.

5. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the tops spring back when touched lightly. Loosen edges and turn the doughnuts out onto a wire rack to cool. (If baking in 2 batches, cool the pan, clean it, then recoat it with cooking spray or oil and sugar)

TO MAKE GLAZE:

In a bowl, whisk confectioners' sugar, vanilla and enough of the milk to make a smooth, thick glaze. When the doughnuts are completely cool, set them, fluted-side up, on a wire rack over wax paper. Spoon some glaze over each doughnut, letting it drip down the sides. (Alternatively, dip the doughnuts in glaze.) Let stand until glaze has set.

Makes 1 dozen doughnuts.

   1      tablespoon    fennel seeds
   3      tablespoons   fresh lemon juice

1. In a large pot, bring wine to a boil. Add water and sugar, stirring to dissolve. Return to a boil.

2. Add pears and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer until pears are soft, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature, 1 1/2 hours. With a slotted spoon, transfer pears to a plate lined with paper towels. Cover and refrigerate poaching liquid and pears. (The pears and liquid will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.)

3. In a small dry skillet, toast fennel seeds over low heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and lightly crush.

4. In a medium saucepan, combine crushed fennel seeds and 3 cups reserved poaching liquid. Bring to a simmer. Remove from heat and let steep for 30 minutes. Strain through a fine sieve. Discard seeds.

5. Cut 3 reserved pears into chunks and place in a food processor. Add fennel-scented poaching liquid and puree until smooth. Strain through a fine sieve into a bowl. Stir in lemon juice. Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 30 minutes.

6. Pour pear puree into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions. (Alternatively, freeze mixture in a shallow cake pan or ice cube trays until solid, about 6 hours. Break into chunks and process in a food processor until smooth.)

7. To serve, cut pears in half lengthwise. Thinly slice each half lengthwise and fan slices onto chilled plates. Garnish with a scoop of Sorbet. Serve immediately.

                         Peach-Blackberry Crumple

Recipe By     : Low-Fat Meals, Woman's Day, 4/96
Serving Size  : 1    Preparation Time :0:00

  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
   7      tablespoons   unsalted butter -- divided
   6      large         peaches -- peeled and diced
   1      cup           blackberries
     1/3  cup           granulated sugar
     3/4  teaspoons     cinnamon
     1/2  teaspoon      ground mace
     1/2                lemon -- juiced
   8      sheets        phyllo dough -- at room temperature
                        confectioners' sugar

1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Using 1 tablespoon of the butter, generously grease a 12 1/4-inch casserole dish.

2. In small saucepan, melt 4 tablespoons butter. Set aside.

3. In large non-reactive bowl, toss peaches and blackberries with sugar, cinnamon, mace and lemon juice. Arrange fruit mixture in casserole. Cut the remaining 2 tablespoons butter into thin chips; dot over fruit.

4. Lay phyllo flat on a countertop and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Transfer 1 sheet of phyllo to a work surface; brush it generously with the melted butter. Gently pick up the buttered dough; loosely crumple it into a ball about 4 inches in diameter. Place the crumpled phyllo on top of the fruit. Repeat with the remaining phyllo, leaving some space between crumples for the juices to bubble up as the fruit cooks.

5. Bake 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 325°F, bake 20 minutes longer, or until edges of the phyllo are light brown. Sprinkle generously with confectioners' sugar. Raise oven temperature to 400° and bake until sugar melts to a glaze, about 8 to 10 minutes.

6. Let crumple stand up to 1 hour. Serve while still warm; the phyllo will get soggy if the crumple stands too long.

Makes 8 servings. Preparation time: About 20 minutes. Baking time: About 38 to 40 minutes.
