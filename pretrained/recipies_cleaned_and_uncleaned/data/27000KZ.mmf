      Title: STRAWBERRY SUPER PIE
 Categories: Pies, Fruits, Davidson
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
    3/4 c  Butter, sweet; melted
  1 1/2 c  Flour, all-purpose
      1 tb Sugar, powdered
    3/4 c  Pecans; chopped

MMMMM--------------------------TOPPING-------------------------------
      2 lb Strawberries; divided
    1/2 c  ;Water
      1 c  Sugar
      3 tb Cornstarch

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
  1 1/4 c  Whipping cream
    1/4 lb Cream cheese; softened
    3/4 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 c  Sugar, powdered
 
  Preheat oven to 375 F.  For crust, mix melted butter with flour,
  powdered sugar, and pecans.  Press into a buttered 10" pie plate.
  Bake for 25 minutes or until light brown. Allow to cool completely.
  
  Start topping by mashing enough strawberries to make one cup. Cut
  tops off remaining strawberries and set aside. Place mashed berries
  in a sauce pan and add water. Mix sugar and cornstarch into crushed
  berry mixture and bring to a boil on top of stove, stirring. Boil
  about one minute or until clear and thickened. Set aside to cool.
  
  For filling, whip cream until stiff.  In another bowl, beat cream
  cheese with vanilla and powdered sugar. Carefully fold whipped cream
  into cream cheese mixture. Spread in cooled crust and refrigerate.
  
  When crushed berry mixture is cool, pie can be assembled. Stand whole
  (or halved, as you like) strawberries on top of cream filling, cut
  side down. When entire filling is covered with whole berries,
  carefully spoon cooled crushed berry mixture over all. Cream filling
  should not be seen between berries. Once the crevices have been
  filled, do not overload the pie with the crushed berry mixture, as it
  will just drip over the sides. Any left- over crushed berry mixture
  is excellent instead of jam on toast or English muffins.

      Title: STRAWBERRY TRIFLE
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           INGREDIENTS:
     10 oz Angel loaf cake
    1/3 c  Strawberry jam or jelly
    1/3 c  Cream sherry OR orange juice
      3 c  Strawberries
           Custard sauce (cf. below)
    3/4 c  Whipping cream
      2 tb Powdered sugar
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      2 tb Sliced almonds, toasted
           -(optional)
      3    Egg yolks
 
  CUSTARD SAUCE:
  
  Mix 1-1/2 tbsp. corstarch with 1/2 cup milk.  Heat 1-3/4 cups of milk
  with 1/4 cup of sugar in a heavy saucepan or double boiler, just to
  the point of boiling.  Remove from the heat.  Stir in the cornstarch
  mixture until it's smooth.  The cornstarch mixes better and without
  lumps if the milk is bone-chilling COLD.
  
  Cook, stirring constantly, until it thickens. It will thicken *fast*,
  so pay attention.  Simmer for three minutes and remove from the heat.
  Beat in 1 tsp. vanilla extract and 3 beaten egg yolks. Cover and
  chill.
  
  THE TRIFLE:
  
  Split the angel loaf cake into 3 layers.  Spread the jam between the
  layers and reassemble the layers.  Cut the cake into 2-inch cubes.
  Arrange the cubes in a 2-quart serving bowl and sprinkle with the
  sherry or orange juice.  Wash the strawberries and pick out 8 to 12
  berries for later garnishing.  Remove the hulls from the rest of the
  berries and slice. Spoon the berries over the cake.
  
  Pour the chilled Custard Sauce over the berries. Cover the mixture and
  refrigerate for an hour or more. Meanwhile, whip the cream to soft
  peaks. Add the sugar and vanilla and whip until it forms *stiff*
  peaks. Spread the cream over the custard.
  
  Garnish the top with whole strawberries (the green hulls against the
  red and white background is particularly pleasing to the eye).
  Sprinkle the entire thing with the almonds, if you have them. Chill
  and serve within a few hours.
  
  Don't try to save this too long. It will get soggy before long and the
  strawberries will get mushy.  So eat it all at once.
  
  (TIP):   Make the Custard Sauce first. Cover and refrigerate it until
  it's ready for use.

  1 1/2 tb Fresh Orange Juice
      1    Egg Yolk
      1 ts Vanilla Extract
      2 oz Imported White Chocolate
           Mousse:
      6 oz Imported White Chocolate
    1/4 c  Heavy Cream
      1 lg Egg White -- at room
           Temperature
      1 tb Sugar

      1 lg Strawberries -- with stems
     25 lg Strawberries -- hulled
    1/2 c  Strawberry Jam Or
           Preserves*
 
  For pastry: Mix first 4 ingredients in a large bowl. Add butter and
  cut into mixture until it resembles fine meal. Blend orange juice
  with egg yolk and vanillla. Add enough juice mixture to dry
  imgredients to form ball that comes together.
  
  Gather dough into a ball and flatten into roughly a 12 inch round.
  Position rack in center of oven and preheat to 375 degrees. Roll
  dough out between sheets of plastic wrap to 1/8 inch thickness. Trim
  to an 11 inch circle (use tart pan as guide). Remove plastic wrap
  from top and invert into a 10 inch round springform pan with
  removable bottom. Remove plastic wrap and press into bottom and up
  sides of pan...  crimp top edges. Freeze for 15 minutes. Line tart
  shell with aluminum foil and weight with pie weights or beans. Bake
  until sides are set - about 10 minutes. REmove foil and weights. Bake
  crust until golden brown - about 16-20 minutes. Sprinkle two ounces
  of white chocola te over hot crust. Let stand for about 1 minute.
  Using the back of a spoon, spread chocolate over bottom and up sides.
  Transfer to rack to cool.
  
  For mousse: Melt white chocolate with 1/4 C heavy cream in a small
  heavy saucepan over very low heat, stirring constantly. Pour into
  bowl. Let stand until just cool. Beat egg white in a small bowl until
  soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar and beat until stiff but not
  dry. Fold whipped cream, 1 tbsp. liqueuer, and egg white into
  chocolate mixture. Spoon mousse into prepared pan, spreading evenly.
  Refrigerate until mousse is set (2 hours or overnight (can be made
  ahead and frozen at this point)).
  
  To assemble: Fan all strawberries by making several legthwise cuts in
  each, starting 1/4 inch from base and extending through the tip. Fan
  with fingertips. Bring jam and remaining 1 tbsp. liqueuer to a boil
  in a heavy small saucepan, stirring constantly. Transfer to processor
  and puree. Brush thin layer of jam over mouse. Place 2 fanned
  strawberries with stems on opposing sides of mousse. Arrange smaller
  fanned strawberries atop artistically.

 Categories: Digest, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 c  Chopped rhubarb (green or
           Pink, it doesnt matter)
      1 c  Chopped strawberries
    1/4 c  (or so) sugar
    1/2 c  (or so) water
 
  In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine rhubarb, sugar and water. Bring
  to simmer, then turn heat very low. Cook without stirring for several
  hours. When the rhubarb is very soft, add the strawberries and cook
  for another hour or so. Stir gently. Add more sugar if needed.
  
  The ratio of rhubarb to berries is flexible.  Im sure you can prepare
  this recipe faster, but Im told rhubarb likes to stew slowly
  (macerate?). I start a batch on Saturday, when Im generally in and
  out of the kitchen anyway. I like the compote warm or cold. If youre
  feeling decadent, its good over ff ice cream or baked goods.

    1/4 ts Baking powder
    3/4 c  Unsalted butter
      5 tb Cold water; or more

MMMMM-----------------STRAWBERRY-RHUBARB FILLING----------------------
      2 pt Strawberries
  1 1/2 lb Fresh rhubarb
    1/2 c  Water
    3/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Fresh, strained orange juice
      2 tb Grated orange zest
      2 tb Orange liqueur
      2 tb Cornstarch
      2 tb Butter

MMMMM--------------------------EGG WASH-------------------------------
      1    Egg yolk
      1 pn Salt
 
  FLAKY PASTRY DOUGH: Combine dry ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir
  well to mix. Add butter and rub in finely, making sure to leave the
  mixture cool and powdery. Stir in half the water, adding more if the
  dough is dry and does not come together. Press the dough together
  well, form into a disk, wrap and chill. After preparing the filling,
  roll less than half the dough on a floured surface and fit it into a
  9-inch glass pie pan. Pour in the filling and spread evenly on the
  dough. Roll the remaining dough to a 12-inch disk and cut into
  1/2-inch strips. Flour a cookie sheet or cake cardboard and arrange
  half the strips on it horizontally, about 1/2-inch from each other.
  Weave in the other strips vertically, again about 1/2-inch from each
  other, to form a woven perpendicular lattice. Chill the lattice until
  firm.
  
  STRAWBERRY-RHUBARB FILLING: For the filling, rinse, hull and slice
  strawberries. Rinse, string and cut the rhubarb into 2-inch lengths.
  Bring the sugar, water, orange juice and zest to a boil in a
  saucepan. Add strawberries and rhubarb and return to simmer, stirring
  often. Don't overcook. Drain well and reserve 1 cup of the liquid.
  Return reserved liquid to boil. Combine the liqueur and cornstarch
  smoothly and stir into the boiling liquid, continuing to stir and
  cook until clear and thickened. Allow to simmer 1 minute, stirring.
  Stir in the drained fruit and the butter. Chill while preparing top
  crust.
  
  EGG WASH: Preheat oven to 375F and set a rack at the lowest level.
  Whisk the yolk and salt together until liquid. Remove tart and
  lattice from refrigerator. Paint lattice with egg wash and slide it
  onto the surface of the filling. Trim away extra dough at edge of
  pan, pressing the edges of the top crust well against the top edge of
  the bottom crust. Bake about 30 minutes, until well colored and
  gently bubbling. If top crust does not color sufficiently, place pie
  on top rack of oven for 5 minutes. Cool slightly and serve warm or at
  room temperature.

      Title: STRAWBERY BANANA SCONES
 Categories: 
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 md Bananas -- mashed
      1 c  Strawberries -- peeled and
           Chopped
      2 tb Sugar
      3 c  Flour, all-purpose
      3 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Butter -- softened
      2 ea Egg -- beaten slightly
 
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
  
  Mix together the bananas, strawberries and sugar, set aside. (Don't
  do this much in advance, the bananas will blacken)
  
  Mix together the flour, baking powder and salt.  Mix well with a
  whisk. Using a pastry blender, mix in the butter until coarse. Still
  using the pastry blender, mix in the eggs, one at a time.
  
  Stir in the banana mixture.  The dough will be very moist and messy.
  Knead it in the bowl enough to pick up all of the flour mixture. (It
  will still be very moist.)
  
  Turn out the dough on a floured board, and flour the top of the dough
  so that flour coats the entire dough. Flatten with a rolling pin or
  your hands to 3/4".
  
  Using a knife, cut the dough into squares, or large wedges, and lay
  onto an ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake in the center of the oven for
  15 - 20 minutes, or until lightly browned.
  
  I have added pine nuts, raspberries, pecans, anything to the basic
  flour, baking powder, salt, butter and eggs mixture. Yum!

  I call this one Streamside trout because it is so basic that you can
  do it along your favorite trout stream on your camp stove. It basic,
  also, because you don't have to do too much to trout or any fish when
  they are that fresh.
  
  Put salt, pepper and cornmeal in paper bag. Drop trout in bag and
  shake vigorously to coat with mixture. Place in hot frying pan and
  cook until golden brown.

  spreading dough evenly. Let rise in warm place about 45 minutes.
  NOTE: Next time I would inhibit rising to below edge of pan. Mine
  rose quite actively, and because of the dough height, the rich
  Streusel ran over in the oven a bit.

  is properly pronounced (Stroyzel, not Stroosel. Streu (Stroy) means
  to strew.) 1/2  cup butter 1 cup sugar 1/2 tsp cinnamon Chop butter
  into the mixed sugar and cinnamon to form fine particles. Sprinkle
  over top of risen batter. Bake in preheated 375 degree oven for 30
  minutes or until top is golden. NOTE: Author suggests top should be
  syrupy, but >> authentic Streusel is crumby (not a negative remark,
  quite the contrary! <G>) but moist enough to hold on the dough
  without falling off.

      Title: STREUSEL PLUM CAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
      2 tb Margarine
      6 tb Granulated sugar
      1    Egg, separated
    3/4 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/4 c  2% milk
      1 c  Halved plums or other fruit
           STREUSEL TOPPING
    1/4 c  Packed brown sugar
    1/2 tb Soft margarine
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
           GLAZE (optional)
      2 tb Icing sugar
    1/2 ts 2% milk
    1/8 ts Vanilla
 
  Grease 8" square cake pan, 9" pie plate or springform pan.
  
  Beat egg white in a small bowl and set aside.  In large bowl, cream
  together margarine, sugar and egg yolk until fluffy. Combine flour and
  baking powder, beat into egg mixture alternately with milk. Fold
  beaten egg white into batter.
  
  Turn into prepared pan.  Halve plums (or slice peach, apple, pear,
  nectarine) and arrange over top.
  
  Streusel topping:  in a small bowl, combine brown sugar, margarine and
  cinnamon.  Mix well and sprinkle over fruit.
  
  Bake at 350 F for about 35 minutes or until top is golden and
  toothpick inserted into cake comes out clean. Time depends on
  thickness of batter.
  
  Glaze:  Combine icing sugar, milk and vanilla.  Mix well. Drizzle over
  cake.
  
  My notes:  original recipe halved makes 5 servings, but it tasted so
  good warm that we only cut 4 servings. Warmed up in microwave for the
  second meal. Use extra fruit (fresh or canned) to make 6 servings.
  Would be nice served at a brunch - moist but not too sweet. Tested
  with fresh nectarines!

      Title: STREWING HERBS
 Categories: Info
      Yield: 1 Info below
 
      1    Info below
 
  "A list of strewing herbs from the late medieval/early Renaissance
  period...contains many that are familiar to us today: sage, tansy,
  violets, roses, mints, pennyroyal, winter savory, marjoram, hops,
  germander, sweet fennel, cowslips, lady's-mantle balm, basil,
  costmary, lavender, juniper, rosemary, chamomile, 'daisies of all
  sorts', lavender cotton, and sweet woodruff.
  
  "Many traditional strewing herbs were valued primarily for their
  aromas; others also had cleansing or pest-repelling qualities, either
  raw or in various preparations. Herbs of the genus Mentha (mints),
  particularly pennyroyal, are flea and tick repellents. Cedar (Cedrus,
  Thuja, or Chamaecyparis spp.) shavings or branch tips remain popular
  as moth and flea repellents.  Australian gum or eucalyptus leaves,
  pine needles, and sage have insecticidal properties. Scented
  geraniums, rosemary, basil, fir needles, and bay leaves are said to
  kill as well as repel insects. Juniper needles, chamomile, lavender,
  lemon peel, lemon balm, orange peel, oregano, thyme, and sweet
  woodruff are all insect repellents. Perhaps discovered by accident or
  trial and error are the disinfectant, antiseptic, or bactericidal
  properties of many medieval strewing herbs. Though less effective
  than when used in washes or infusions, the salient properties are
  found in the raw states of many plants.
  
  "Today, some of us may dimly remember older family members engaging in
  _real_ spring and fall cleaning, when virtually everything in a house
  was scrubbed, pulled up, laundered, taken down, oiled, put up,
  painted, washed out, or taken into the yard and beaten. Strewing
  herbs came into play as well: dried southernwood and lavender heads
  were added to the straw under the wool winter carpets before they
  were tacked down, lavender and cedar sprigs tied up in bags with
  woolens when they were stored away each spring, lemon oil used to
  polish wood floors and furniture."
  
  "You may place dried leaves, blossoms, and branches of favorite herbs
  under area rugs, either loose or in large, loose cloth bags - old
  pillowcases are ideal. (Don't use fresh herbs, or you may indeed have
  something to muck out!)  You may also tuck bagged dried herbs under
  sofa and chair cushions, between the mattress and mattress cover of a
  bed, under the pillows in pet bedding - wherever their aroma will be
  released by pressure or warmth. A thick layer of freshly dried
  aromatic leaves or branches laid in newspaper and topped with a small
  area rug is a delight in closets. Wherever you use dried herbs, be
  alert for possible allergic reactions to them; in my experience,
  allergies and irritation of mucous membranes are particularly likely
  with the insect-repelling herbs, and fine dust may be released when
  bagged herbs are sat, stepped, or slept upon.
  
  "Check bagged plant materials frequently if you live in a humid
  climate. They are apt to mildew if rugs become damp or if the weather
  is unusually muggy.
  
  "Strewing herbs have an attractive outdoor use as well. You may
  scatter handfuls of lightly crushed fresh herbs around a patio or
  lawn just before a party...Pick the herbs early in the day to
  maximize their scents, keep the stems in water until ready to use,
  and use small stems or finely chopped larger stems to keep footing
  safe. Add an extra doormat if your guests will be coming indoors from
  the garden: damp herb bits can stick to shoes."
  
  Excerpts from Robbie Cranch's "Herbs Underfoot: The Many Uses of
  Strewing Herbs, Yesterday and Today" article in "The Herb Companion."

           Mahleb (Middle Eastern
           -spice)
           Black caraway seeds

  Place cheese in a Teflon saucepan and add a dash of mahleb and salt
  and a sprinkling of black seeds. Heat on low until cheese is melted
  thoroughly. Remove from heat and drain excess water.
  
  Pick up hot cheese in a lump, and make a hole in the center to
  resemble a doughnut.
  
  With both hands, stretch and turn the cheese to form a large loop.
  Double the strand of cheese, making two strands of cheese of even
  length. Repeat, stretching and looping; the more you stretch the
  stringier the cheese becomes. Repeat stretching several times. Twist
  ends in opposite directions and intertwine rope into a braid. Place
  one end through the loop of the other to lock it.
  
  Set cheese aside to dry thoroughly. Wrap in plastic wrap and
  refrigerate or freeze.

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 pk Yeast
      2 ts Sugar
    1/3 c  ;Water, warm
      4 c  Flour
      3 tb Butter; in pieces
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  ;Water, ice, without cubes
      1 lb Ricotta
    1/2 c  Parmesan
    1/2 lb Mozzarella, sliced
    1/2 lb Pepperoni
      2 tb Butter; melted
           Sesame seeds
 
  Preheat oven to 200 degrees for 15 minutes and turn off. Combine
  yeast, sugar and warm water in a small mixing bowl. Set aside for 5
  minutes until foamy.  In the workbowl of a food processor, add flour,
  butter pieces and salt. Process for 20 seconds.  Add ice water to
  yeast. With the processor running, add yeast-water mixture gradually,
  until all of the moisture is absorbed and the dough leaves the side
  of the bowl. Process for an additional 60 seconds. Transfer dough
  from the workbowl to a large greased mixing bowl. Cover with a
  kitchen towel and place in warm off oven. Allow to rise until
  doubled, approximately 1 1/2 hours.
  
  Combine the ricotta and Parmesan. Punch down the risen dough and
  transfer to a floured rolling surface. With quick, hard strokes, roll
  dough into a large rectangle, approximately 1/2 inch thick. Layer
  one- half of the mozzarella cheese evenly down the center leaving
  approximately three inches of exposed dough on either side. Top with
  the ricotta mixture and pepperoni, and the remaining mozzarella.
  Overlap the exposed dough over the cheese mixture and pinch well on
  all sides to seal.
  
  Transfer to a large cookie sheet, seam side up.  Cover with a kitchen
  towel and return to the warmed oven. Allow to rise until doubled,
  approximately 45 minutes. Brush loaf with melted butter and sprinkle
  with sesame seeds. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes or until
  loaf is well browned and hollow sounding when thumped.

      Title: STRONES OR OATCAKES
 Categories: Breads, Irish, Loo
      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      2 c  Oatmeal (not rolled
           -oats; coarsely
           -ground oats)
      1 pn Baking powder
      1 pn Salt
      1 ts Bacon fat
           Boiling water
 
  For hundreds of years in Ulster, a large STRONE was made in the shape
  of a cross to celebrate the feast of St. Brigit. Strones were
  traditionally served hot and dripping with freshly made butter.
  
  Mix the dry ingredients. Melt the fat in a little boiling water and
  use to mix the other ingredients to a stiff dough. Scatter more
  oatmeal over it and knead thoroughly. Roll out as thinly as possible,
  in a circle. Put on a baking sheet. Cut a cross on top so that when
  cooked the oatcake can be easily broken into quarters, the
  traditional FARLS. Bake in a moderate oven (350F, Gas 4, 180C) for
  about 20 min. Serve with lots of butter.

    1/4 c  Candied orange peel,
           -chopped fine
    1/4 c  Raisins, steamed
           -(steamed, or soaked in
           -hot water, until soft)
      2 ts Lemon peel, grated

MMMMM---------------------------ICING--------------------------------
      1 c  Sugar, powdered
      2 tb Lemon juice
 
  MAKE THE DOUGH:  Soften the yeast in warm water in a bowl. Mix flour
  with sugar and salt.  Cut in the butter until mixture has a fine,
  even crumb.
  
  Beat eggs and extra yolks; mix with yeast, then stir into the flour
  mixture. Add the sour cream and the vanilla and mix well.
  
  Knead dough on floured surface for 5 minutes.  Divide in half and
  roll each half into a 12 inch square. Cover.
  
  MAKE THE FILLING:  Melt butter in a large pan.  Add poppy seed and
  stir-fry for 3 minutes.  Add honey, lemon juice and raisins to poppy
  seeds. Cover and remove from heat. Let stand for 10 minutes.
  
  Beat egg whites with sugar until stiff moist peaks form. Fold in
  orange and lemon peels and then gently fold in poppy seed mixture.
  
  Spread half of the filling on each dough square (after you uncover
  them). Roll up as you would for a jelly-roll and seal the edges.
  Place on greased baking sheets and cover.  Let rise until doubled in
  bulk (approx. 1 1/2 hours).
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Bake about 45 minutes, then remove
  from oven and cool.
  
  MAKE THE ICING:  Mix powdered sugar and lemon juice until smooth.
  Spread this mixture evenly over the rolls.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Poppy seed rolls -- This recipe could be used as part of a
  12-course meal known in Polish as Wigilia, or on its own. Wigilia is
  eaten after sundown on Christmas Eve. Yield: Makes 2 rolls.
  
  *  You can grind poppy seeds in a mortar and pestle. Specialty food
  stores sell grinders specifically designed for poppy seeds. Some
  spice shops sell poppy seeds already ground, but like all spices they
  lose their freshness much more rapidly after they are ground. This
  year (1987) in Poland, the people are having a very hard time finding
  enough poppy seeds for their strucle z makiem because there is a
  government crackdown on the growing of all poppies in an attempt to
  control opium production.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  3-4 hours including yeast rising time.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      Title: STRUDEL DOUGH
 Categories: Desserts, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           *INGREDIENTS*
      2 c  Flour
           1Tbls.      butter or
           -margerine
    1/4 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Water, lukewarm
      1    Whole egg
 
  Source: Treasured Slovenian & International Recipes
  
  *DIRECTIONS* Mix flour, butter, egg and salt. Add lukewarm water and
  mix. Place on a board and knead for 10 minutes or more; or you may
  toss and beat dough on the board for about 15 minutes. The more you
  beat the dough the better the dough will be to work with. Place in a
  greased bowl. Cover and let rest for at least one hour.
  
  *HOW TO STRETCH STRUDEL DOUGH* Spread table with a cloth large enough
  to hang over the sides. Sprinkle lightly with flour and place dough
  in the center. With a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough to make
  an 18 inch circle. Slide hand gently below circle of dough and let
  the dough rest on the back of your hands with your palms down. Now
  pull the center of the dough gently toward you. Stretch and pull the
  dough as you walk slowly around the table. Dough should be thin as
  tissue paper. Then tear or cut off the thick outer edges, leaving
  about two inches of dough hanging over the sides of the table. Now
  proceed to spread on the desired filling immediately. Roll up gently
  by lifting the cloth and place your strudel in a well greased baking
  pan to bake.
  
  (You can also use this recipe for struklje)
  
  *VARIATIONS* The only difference is that Grandma uses a large
  cast-iron skillet to bake these. She says that you get a better crust
  this way. Because of the skillet, once you roll up the strudel (like
  a jelly roll) you must curl the strudel into a spiral shape to fit
  into the skillet.

  Cover a large table completely with a floured cloth. Place the dough
  in the center of the cloth and, working in all directions, roll out
  the dough as thin as possible. Spread a little melted butter over the
  dough, and stretch it with your hands--CAREFULLY working all around
  the table to avoid tearing the dough--until it is very thin and almost
  transparent. As you stretch, brush the dough with more butter as
  necessary. Cut off any thick edges, then let the dough rest for about
  15 minutes before using it. NOTE: The 2 lbs of dough produced by this
  recipe can be stretched into a sheet about 6 feet square--enough for
  two 3-foot strudels. Any excess dough can be       restretched. With
  practice in stretching the dough,       you may be able to make a
  6-foot square out of 1 pound of dough.
    GOOD LUCK!!!

      Title: STRUDEL PASTRY BASIC RECIPE
 Categories: Molto
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1    Stick butter plus 3 sticks
           (cold)
      1 ts Salt
  2 1/2 c  Flour plus 1 cup
    1/2 c  Ice water
 
  In a food processor, place 1 stick of butter, 1 teaspoon salt, and 2
  1/2 cups flour and blend until texture of breadcrumbs.  Slowly add
  ice water until dough comes together.  Remove and form into a ball,
  then flatten it into a 8 by 10-inch rectangle and place in
  refrigerator. This is called the pasta mixture.
  
  In a food processor, place 3 remaining sticks of butter and 1 cup four
  until blended and scrape out on to a board.  Working quickly, form
  this mixture in a 4-inch square and place in refrigerator. This is
  called the burro mixture.
  
  After 1/2 hour, when the two mixtures are similar in texture, place
  pasta mixture on a well-floured clean marble surface.  Place burro
  mixture in center and fold the pasta mixture over it, like wrapping a
  gift. Flatten with a rolling pin and roll out to a 8 by 16-inch
  rectangle, flouring regularly.  If butter comes to surface, flour the
  spot heavily and continue working.  Fold bottom third up and top
  third down to form a small package and turn one quarter clockwise.
  Pat dough with rolling pin to adhere and roll out to large 8-inch by
  16-inch rectangle again. Repeat folding process and refrigerate 30
  minutes, covered in a moist cloth. Remove and repeat the
  rolling-and-folding process 3 times.  Allow 30 minutes refrigeration
  between each maneuver.  The dough is now ready and will keep in the
  refrigerator 10 days, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap.

 Categories: Main dish, Meats
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Prime rib (per person)
      1 ts MSG powder
      1 ts Paprika
      2 tb Worcestershire sauce
           Salt to taste
           Pepper to taste
           Rock salt (ice cream salt)
 
  Rub seasoning into meat. In a large roaster(not aluminum) pour a
  layer of rock salt until bottom of pan is completely covered. Lightly
  dampen the rock salt with water until salt is just moist. Place the
  meat onto the salt in a standing rib position. Then cover prime rib
  completely with rock salt and dampen with water. DO NOT cover the
  roaster. Place in preheated oven at 500 degrees. Roast 15 to 18 per
  pound (rare 15 minutes). When cooking time is completed, remove
  roast. Break rock salt away from meat with a hammer (hard seal formed)
  
  NOTE: DO NOT use any powder rock salt. I filter the rock salt with
  colander. Use only that rock salt that does not sift through the
  colander.
  
  Prime rib cooked this way becomes fork tender.

 Categories: Fish, Main dish, Christmas, Russian
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      1 lg Firm Fleshed Fish; (White
           -fish, Canadian Sole,
           -Flounder, About 2 Pounds)
      3    Fish Heads And Trimmings
      2 lg Onions
      2 lg Carrots
      4    Black Peppercorns; To Taste
      1 lg Bay Leaf
      2 tb Sugar
      2 ts Salt
      1 pk Plain Geletin; (1 Envelope)
 
  Wast the whole fish and fish heads in cold water.  Run a knife over
  the fish, scraping from tail to head, to remove any leftover scales.
  Rinse the gut cavity. Cut off the head at the gills, rinse again and
  cut into equal pieces.  Rub inside and out with salt and set aside.
  Remove the gills from the heads.  Combine the fish heads, tail, fins
  and all ingredients in a 4 quart pot, then cover with 6 cups of cold
  water. Bring to a boil, skimming off the foam, then reduce to a
  gentle simmer. Cook for 20 minutes or until the heads are cooked
  through. Using a small sieve, lined with a wet towel or cheesecloth,
  pour the liquid into a 2 quart jar. When most is poured off, press
  lightly on the remains and pour off the rest. Place the sections of
  fish in about 2 cups of stock.  Bring to a gentle boil and simmer for
  about 10 minutes or until the fish turns white. Do NOT overcook or
  the pieces will fall apart. With a slotted spoon, remove the fish
  pieces and place on a platter to cool.  When cool enough to handle,
  remove the skin and bones trying to keep the pieces large and not
  ragged. Cover and cool. Strain the cooking liquid again and add to
  the rest of the stock. For a more intense flavor, stock may be
  reheated and reduced by a third. Dissolve the gelatin in 1 cup of
  fish tock and add. Taste and add salt if needed. Cool.  Pour in
  enough stock to cover the bottom of a 6 cup fish mold or glass pan by
  1/2 inch. Reftigerate until set. Remove the peel from thecooked
  carrots and slice them into thin rounds. Arrange the carrot rounds in
  an attractive pattern on the aspic, add a little more cooled stock,
  and cool until set. Evenly spread the fish pieces over the aspic,
  covering with more stock, cooling until set. Continue to add stock
  until the fish is completely covered. Refrigerate overnight.
  
  TO SERVE:
  
  Run a sharp knife around the edge of the mold.  Place a platter on
  top of the mold and invert.  (A hot damp cloth helps to release it.)
  Garnish with parsley sprigs and lemon slices just before serving.

  Mix juice of 2 lemons & the flour in a large bowl. Add 2 qt water &
  mix thoroughly.  Wash artichokes, bend back & snap off outer leaves.
  Leave only the tender inner leaves. Slice off these leaves just above
  the heart & scoop out the fuzzy choke & remaining pinkish leaves. Cut
  off the stem & peel around the base with a vegetable peeler until you
  reach the whitish tender part.  As you trim each artichoke, take a
  lemon half, sprinkle it with salt & rub it all around & inside the
  base to prevent discoloration. Then drop each artichoke into the
  lemon water mixture.
  
  Remove jackets of fava beans.  Sprinkle beans with salt & let stand
  for 5 minutes.  Remove skins, rinse & reserve.
  
  Heat 1 c olive oil in skillet.  Add onions, 1/2 ts salt & saute for 5
  minutes.  Stir in fava beans & rice. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring, &
  add 1/2 c water. Cover & cook for 5 minutes till the water has been
  absorbed. Stir in the dill, salt & remove from heat. Let stand
  covered for 15 minutes.
  
  Remove artichokes from water bath.  Reserve 4 1/2 c liquid. Stuff
  centre cavity of artichokes with the rice. Place each one on a sheet
  of wax paper, sprinkle with a little water & wrap as you would a
  package. Arrange them stem sides down in a heavy shallow pan. Add 1
  1/2 c reserved liquid, 1/4 c olive oil, juice of 1/2 lemon & sugar.
  Cover & cook over medium heat for 10 minutes.  Reduce heat to low &
  simmer for 1 hour. The liquid will be continually absorbed so add
  more as needed. When the artichokes are tender, let them cool,
  Unwrap them & arrange them on a serving platter. Serve cold with
  garnish as part of a buffet.

      Title: STUFFED BELL PEPPERS
 Categories: Main dish, Beef, Lamb
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 md Green Bell peppers*
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
      1 md Onion, finely chopped
      2    Cloves, minced garlic
    1/2 lb Ground beef
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper
    1/2 ts Thyme
    1/2 c  Drained stewed tomatoes
      1 c  Cooked rice**
      1 tb Parsley
 
  1. Cut top off each pepper and remove seeds and veins. Blanch in
  boiling water for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and let cool. 2. In a
  skillet, heat oil, add onion and garlic and saute for 4 to 5 minutes.
  3. Add meat, salt, pepper and thyme and cook until meat is browned.
  4. In a large mixing bowl, combine the meat, tomatoes, rice and
  parsley. 5. Stuff each pepper with the meat mixture, place top back
  on each and bake in a preheated 325 degree F. oven for 20 to 25
  minutes.
   *You may use yellow or red peppers as a substitute for eye appeal.
  One of my favorite serving tricks to use green, red, yellow peppers
  in this preparation. Then, use a large, well garnished platter for
  the cooked peppers. If you use a creole type suace, the affect is
  truely spectacular. **I have from time to time cut the peppers in
  half lenghtwise in order to add plate coverage. This is especially
  important if the peppers are small. It gives the appearence of
  quantity with out the bulk. When I do this I increase the cooked rice
  to 1 1/2 cups. Your mileage may vary!

      Title: STUFFED CABBAGE ROLLS
 Categories: German, Vegetables, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Brown rice
      3 c  Water
      2 ts Salt
      1 ts Dillseed
    1/2 ts Marjoram
    3/4 ts Pepper
  2 1/2 c  Onion; chopped
      5 tb Vegetable oil
    1/2 ts Paprika
      2 ea Garlic; cloves, minced
      2 ea Eggs; large, slightly beaten
    1/4 c  Bread crumbs
    1/2 c  Parsley; fresh, minced
  2 1/2 lb Cabbage
      1 x  Cheesecloth; about 6 ft.
  2 1/2 c  Tomatoes; canned, chopped
    1/2 c  Vermouth; dry
    1/2 c  Beef broth
      2 tb Tomato paste
    1/2 ts Sugar
 
  In a medium bowl cover brown rice with hot water and soak for 3 hours.
  Drain.  In a 2-quart saucepan combine rice, 3 cups water, and 1 1/2 t
  salt. Simmer covered for 40 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed.
  Add the dillseed, marjoram, and 1/2 t pepper. In a large skillet
  saute 1 1/2 cups chopped onion in 3 T hot vegetable oil until soft,
  about 6 to 8 minutes. Add paprika and garlic, continue cooking and
  stirring for 2 minutes. Stir in the rice mixture, eggs, bread crumbs,
  and parsley. Adjust seasonings to taste.  Core cabbage and, in a
  large pot, blanch the cabbage cored-side-down in boiling salted water
  for 5 minutes or until it is softened.  Drain.  Remove 12 leaves and
  cut off one fourth of each leaf from the base. Arrange 1 leaf
  curved-side down on a square of dampened cheesecloth and place 3 T of
  rice mixture in the center. Wrap the leaf around the filling and
  twist the corners of the cheesecloth to form the leaf into a roll.
  Continue making rolls with remaining filling. Chop remaining cabbage
  to make 3 cups and, in a large frypan, saute with 1 cup chopped
  onions and 2 T vegetable oil until soft. Add tomatoes, vermouth,
  broth, tomato paste, sugar, 1/2 t salt and 1/4 t pepper. Simmer the
  mixture for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust seasonings.
  Transfer cabbage-tomato sauce mixture to a large baking dish. Arrange
  the cabbage rolls close together in one layer on the sauce. Spoon
  some of the mixture over the rolls. Bake at 325 degrees F for 1 1/2
  hours. Baste rolls 4 to 5 times during cooking.  Let the dish cool.
  Cover and refrigerate overnight. Remove cheesecloth. Heat in
  preheated 350 degree oven for 30 minutes before serving.

      1    Cantaloupe, medium
           White or rose wine
    1/4 lb Blue cheese, crumbled
    1/2 lb Ricotta or farmer's cheese

  Cut a slice off the top of the cantaloupe, scoop out the fruit with a
  melon-ball cutter. Marinate the melon balls in wine until time to
  serve. In the meantime, blend together cheeses and cream. Season to
  taste with salt and pepper. Pile the cheese mixture lightly into the
  cantaloupe shell. If it does not fill the shell lower the rim of the
  shell by cutting with knife in jagged edges to form a "basket edge."
  To eat, spear melon balls with toothpicks, and dip them into the
  cheese mixture for a very pretty, refreshingly different appetizer.
  Makes about 1 cup cheese mixture and about 20 melon balls.

    1/4 ts Ginger

MMMMM-----------------------JERK SEASONING----------------------------
      4    Green onions, chopped
      1    Garlic clove
      1    Hot chili pepper, such as
           -jalapeno or Scotch bonnet,
           -seeded
      1 tb Ground allspice
      1 ts Dried thyme leaves
    1/2 ts Ground nutmeg
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
      2 tb Fresh lime juice
 
   TO PREPARE JERK SEASONING: Combine green onions, garlic, chili
  pepper, allspice, thyme, nutmeg, cayenne, and lime juice in a
  blender; puree the mixture. Store in a covered glass container in the
  refigerator. Makes 1/3 cup.
   To use, rub 2 teaspoons jerk seasoning over the surface of the meat.
  Let stand at least one hour before cooking. Overnight marinating
  enhances flavor.
  
   PREPARE MEAT: Have butcher crack the rib bone along the length for
  easy serving. Cut pockets across the loin at 3/4" intervals to hold
  the stuffing. Rub jerk seasoning over roast, place in oven roasting
  bag and refigerate at least 2 hours or overnight.
   To calculate microwave cooking time, allow 12-13 minutes per pound of
  roast on medium (50 %) power.
   Combine celery, onions, garlic and margarine in a 2-quart glass
  measure; cover with vented plastic wrap and microwave on high 2 1/2
  minutes. Add rice, pineapple, banana, cheese, lime zest, lime juice,
  rum, pineapple juice and ginger; stir to combine.
   Spoon stuffing into pockets in roast and place the remainder in a
  1-quart casserole. Return roast to oven cooking bag and close the end
  of the bag loosley, leaving an opening the diameter of a quarter.
  Place bag with meaty side down in a 2-quart rectangular dish.
  Microwave on medium power for half the calculated time.
   Turn roast over and continue to microwave on medium for remainder of
  the time determined. At the end of the cooking time, roast should
  reach 150 degrees internally. Cover with foil and let stand 10
  minutes until temperature has reached 160 degrees. If it has not,
  remove foil and microwave meat 5-10 minutes longer, or until it
  reaches the temperature.
   During standing time, microwave remaining stuffing on high 3 minutes.

  Known in some areas as vegetable pear or christophine, and as
  mirliton in Louisiana, delicate-tasting chayotes (Sechium edule) are
  superb when stuffed New Orleans Creole style. They're also wonderful
  sliced, steamed until crisp tender, and dressed, along with their
  edible single large seed, in a mustard vinaigrette. [PATh 12 Oc 96
  mcRecipe]
  
  Cut off and discard stem end from each squash and slice the vegetable
  in half lengthwise. Remove seeds and use in another dish, if desired.
  If necessary, cut a thin slice off the rounded side of each half so
  it will sit level.
  
  Place halves on a steamer rack set over simmering water, cover, and
  steam until crisp-tender, about 20 minutes. Remove from steamer and
  let stand until cool enough to handle. Using a spoon, scoop out the
  flesh from each squash half into a bowl, leaving a shell about 1/4
  inch thick; reserve.
  
  STUFFING:  Heat 3 tablespoons each oil and butter in a skillet over
  medium-high heat. Add the yellow and green onions, sweet pepper, and
  celery and saute until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Add
  the garlic and saute 1 minute. Stir in the tomatoes, reserved squash
  pulp, parsley, thyme, and bay leaf and continue to cook until all the
  vegetables are almost tender, about 5 minutes longer. Reduce the heat
  to medium-low, stir in the shrimp pieces, and cook until they turn
  bright pink. Stir in cooked crab and bread crumbs and season to taste
  with salt and black and cayenne peppers.
  
  Mound the stuffing mixture into the reserved squash halves. Dot the
  tops with butter and place in a greased baking dish. Bake until the
  tops are golden brown, about 25 minutes. Garnish with thyme sprigs
  and lemon wedges and serve piping hot.

      Title: STUFFED CHERRY TOMATOES
 Categories: Tomatoes, Summer, Southwester
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
 
       32    cherry tomatoes
        1    filling recipe
  
  Stuffed cherry tomatoes are a bit more work than large ones, but they
  have the same virtues;  they add color to an hors d'oeuvres platter,
  are easy to handle, and are perfect portion controls. Prepare then in
  the same way as the shells for Cold Stuffed Tomatoes, although you
  will have to be even more careful not to tear the sides. Discard the
  caps in this case. Salt and drain the tomatoes for 30 minutes, and
  stuff with the filling of your= choice. Each tomato will hold about 1
  tablespoon of filling. Try Salmon Mousse, Tapenade Dip, Pesto
  Mayonnaise, or Taramosalata; or mash a bit of soft fresh chevre
  cheese such as Montrachet. Garnish each tomato with a sprig of fresh
  dill or parsley or a basil leaf. Chill until serving time.

      Title: STUFFED CHICKEN
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1    Chicken, with giblets
    1/2 c  Rice, white (raw)
      1 pn Saffron (use the
           -amount that sticks
           -to the first 1/2 inch
           -tip of a paring knife)
      2    Celery stalks
     10 md Mushrooms
      3    Scallions
      3 tb Butter
 
  Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees F.  Clean the chicken, remove any large
  gobs of fat and rinse away any residual goo from its inside.
  
  Cook the rice in 1 cup of water, along with the saffron. Salt to
  taste. Saute the giblets in about 2 T of butter. While these are
  cooking, clean and cut up the celery, mushrooms and scallions into
  small pieces.
  
  When the giblets are done, chop them well.
  
  Mix the rice, vegetables and mushrooms together in a bowl, and cram
  as much as will fit into the chicken. Tie the ends of the drumsticks
  and the tail together. Rub about 1 T of butter over the skin of the
  chicken. Place remaining stuffing into a glass or ceramic casserole,
  cover, and set aside.
  
  Place in the chicken in the oven, uncovered.  After 10 minutes, lower
  heat to 350 degrees F. The chicken should cook approximately 20
  minutes per pound. Test the chicken by pricking it in the thickest
  part of the thigh; when it is done, only clear juices will come out.
  If the chicken is still underdone, blood will come out.
  
  Half an hour before the chicken is done, put the additional stuffing
  in the oven.
  
  If there are leftovers, be sure to remove any extra stuffing from the
  inside of the chicken, as it will sour if stored inside the bird.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Roast chicken stuffed with rice and vegetables -- This is a recipe
  that I've evolved slowly, and I think I've finally got it right.
  Yield: Serves 2-3.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (cooking time is critical)
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 45 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

      2 md Onions; finely chopped
      2 tb Butter
     20 oz Frozen spinach
           - thawed and drained

      2    Eggs; slightly beaten
    1/2 c  Coarsely chopped parsley
      2 tb Fresh herbs

           Freshly ground pepper
           Nutmeg; to taste
     16    Halves of chicken breast
           -(order the chicken boned,
           - split, with the skin on)
 
  Saute the onions in butter until soft.  Combine with the other
  ingredients (except chicken) and mix well. Season highly. Place each
  breast skin side up on a board. Trim away excess fat. Loosen skin
  from 1 side of breast and stuff approximately 1/3 cup of the filling
  under the skin. Tuck the skin and meat under breast, forming an even,
  round, dome shape. Put the stuffed breasts in a buttered Pyrex or
  metal baking dish. Fifteen minutes before baking, preheat over to 350
  F (175 C). Bake breasts until golden brown, about 30 to 35 minutes.
  Don't overcook or chicken will be dry. Cool slightly before serving,
  and cool to room temperature if you are going to slice into smaller
  serving pieces. Arrange on platters and decorate with fresh herbs.

  batter--you may have to double the batter to be sure you cover the
  dish well--and pour over the chilies. Add the cheddar cheese and
  cook, COVERED, slowly in a 300*F oven until done. You will know it is
  done when a knife inserted in the middle comes out relatively clean.

      3 md Courgettes
     75 g  Onion, chopped
  1 1/2 tb Olive oil
     40 g  Ground almonds
     25 g  Breadcrumbs

  Serves 2-3
  
  Courgettes lend themselves to stuffing in many imaginative ways. This
  particular mixture is nutty and cheesy, a delicate and appetizing
  filling for blanched courgettes. A lovely summer dish that can be
  served hot or warm.
  
  Blanch the courgettes in boiling water for 5 minutes, then cut them
  lengthwise and cool a little. Scoop out the inner flesh carefully
  with a grapefruit knife and chop it very finely.
  
  Cook the onions gently in the oil until they are soft and sweet,
  about 10 minutes. Stir in the courgette flesh and cook for another 5
  minutes. Add the ground almonds, breadcrumbs and cheese and stir
  until well mixed together. Mix in the beaten egg so that the mixture
  is soft but firm.
  
  Fill the courgette halves with the stuffing and sprinkle with
  Parmesan. Garnish with the browned flaked almonds and bake at 200
  degrees C / 400 degrees F / gas 6 for 15 minutes.

  3. In large bowl, combine bread cubes, parsley, and mixture from
  skillet. Toss until well mixed and all bread has been moistened.
  Cover, and set aside.
  
  4. When pork has roasted 2 hours, remove from oven. Spoon bread
  mixture into center of crown. With serving spoon, drizzle some of pan
  drippings over stuffing. Return to oven and bake 30 to 45 minutes
  more or until meat thermometer inserted into thickest part of roast
  registers 155'F. Remove from oven and. allow pork to stand 5 to 10
  minutes until meat temperature rises to 160'F. Allow pork to rest 10
  to 15 minutes before carving. Transfer to serving plate; remove foil
  from bones. Decorate rib bones with paper booties or kumquats, if
  desired.
  
  5. To carve the roast, use a sharp carving knife and a two-pronged
  carving fork. Slice down between the ribs, removing one chop at a
  time. Spoon stuffing onto each serving.
  
  Paper Booties: Cut desired number of 4-inch squares from writing or
  wrapping paper. One at a time, fold squares in half gently without
  creasing paper at fold. Make cuts 1/8 inch apart through fold to
  within 1/4 inch of cut edges. To attach to rib bones, carefully wrap
  uncut ends of paper strips around bones and secure with tape.

      2 qt Chicken stock
           * Available in Oriental
           -markets.

MMMMM--------------------PREPARING CUCUMBERS-------------------------
 
  Select cucumbers which are 7 to 8 inches long, but as small around as
  you can get. Peel the cucumbers and then slice each across into four
  equal pieces. Using a small spoon scoop out the seeds being careful
  to leave a "bottom" in each piece. Preparing the meat stuffing:
  Combine the ground pork, garlic, ginger, Cilantro, 4 of the green
  onions, and fish sauce. Make a small ball of the mixture and
  microwave for about a minute to cook thoroughly.  Taste for
  seasoning, and correct if needed. Using your fingers stuff the meat
  mixture into the cucumbers (stick a toothpick through the side of the
  cucumber and into the meat to hold it in place while it cooks), and
  place in the hot stock. Cook about 15 minutes and add the 4 remaining
  green onions cut in 2" lengths, the two carrots cut into matchsticks
  and the canned quail eggs.  Cook another 5 minutes and serve
  immediately. Note: If you can manage to keep the soup just barely
  below the boil your finished soup will be very clear.  If that
  doesn't work out don't worry.....it will taste just as good! Subj:

  roll a piece of fresh salmon (about 1-inch in diameter and 4-inches
  long) in a small fillet. Fasten each roll with a toothpick. Unstuffed
  sole or sole that has been stuffed with shrimp, clams, scallops or
  crabmeat can also be used for this recipe. It is advisable to roll
  sole fillets even though they may not be stuffed.

      1    Celery rib, chopped (~1-3 c)
    1/3 c  Chopped bell pepper,
           -red or green
    1/4 lb Unsalted butter, melted
      1 lb Crabmeat
      2 c  White bread torn into small
           -pieces
      2 lg Eggs, lightly beaten
      1 tb Chopped parsley
      1    1/4 lb center slice boned
           -country ham, about 1/4"
           -thick, finely diced
      1 tb Amontillado sherry
           Salt to taste
           Freshly ground pepper to
           -taste
           Juice of one lemon
 
  Preheat the oven to 350'F. Lay the fish bottom side (the white side)
  up on a cutting board and make an incision in each fish down to the
  backbone along the center of the fish, stopping just shy of the head
  and tail. Working at an oblique angle, slip the knife in between the
  flesh and backbone and run the knife down the ribs on both sides of
  the backbone.
  
  Saute the onion, celery and bell pepper in a heavy saute pan in about
  half of the butter over medium-high heat until the onions begin to
  become transparent, about 5 minutes. Toss with the crabmeat, bread,
  eggs, parsley, ham, and sherry, seasoning to taste with salt and
  pepper. Remember that the country ham is salty and will impart its
  flavor to the crabmeat. Stuff the fish with the mixture, brush a
  glass baking pan with some of the remaining butter, and add the fish
  to the pan. Mix the rest of the butter with the lemon juice, pour
  over the fish, and bake for 30-45 minutes or until the fish flakes
  easily with a fork.

  This is a relatively simple one.  From the picture in the book, the
  lobsters are Australian rock lobsters or spiney lobsters. They're much
  smaller that our Maine lobsters. This probably fits the bill for the
  "New" Hong Kong cuisine in that it uses butter and milk. I'd think
  this would probably be quite good made with Dungeness crab as well as
  lobster. Establishment: The Regent Hotel (Hong Kong) Salisbury Road,
  Tsimshatsui, Kowloon.

  STUFFED LOBSTER TAILS (12 servings) Chef: Ip Wah (The Regent Hotel)
  
  The literal translation, "Healthy and Spirited Dragon and Horse"
  cannot convey the symbolic values of the poetically rhyming Chinese
  characters. In the Cantonese dialect, a lobster is a "dragon shrimp"
  and the word for "horse" sounds similar to part of "water chestnut".
  Both creatures summon up images of power, stamina, elegance and other
  desired virtues.
  
  To prepare: 1. Soak and wash dried scallops. Shred and deep-fry until
  crisp, and put aside for garnish. If using red pepper, chop finely. 2.
  Remove lobster shells. Retain tails and clean. Set aside enough
  uncooked lobster meat required for stuffing, and dice it fairly
  finely. Chop remaining lobster meat into small square chunks. 3.
  Prepare cornstarch mixture, mixing well.
  
  To cook: 1. For Portuguese sauce, heat butter over low flame, add
  flour, then rest of sauce ingredients. Cook into a paste, set aside.
  2. For stuffing, saute ingredients in a little oil over low flame.
  Add Portuguese sauce.  Remove from heat and when cooled, stuff into
  lobster tail shells. Brush exposed stuffing with egg, sprinkle with
  bread crumbs. 3. Heat until smoking, sufficient oil for deep-frying,
  lower flame, and immerse stuffed lobster tails (stuffing facing
  upwards) for 5 minutes, or until golden. Remove from wok.
  (Alternatively, bake unbread-crumbed stuffed lobster tails in a hot
  oven for 3 to 5 minutes, until surfaces are dry. Brush with egg and
  coat with bread crumbs, bake again until golden.) 4. For lobster meat
  chunks, heat wok, add 4 to 5 cups of oil.  When oil is at medium heat
  add lobster meat and blanch to seal in the juice. Remove lobster.
  Clean and reheat wok with 1/2 cup oil, and stir-fry lobster with
  diced water chestnut (or celery) and cornstarch mixture for 1 minute.
  
  To present: 1. Place stir-fried mixture in centre of platter, and
  sprinkle shredded dried scallops (or chopped red pepper) over. 2.
  Arrange lobster tails in a circle around it.

      Title: STUFFED MONSTER ZUCCHINI
 Categories: Vegetables, August
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Giant zucchini
        x  Rice
        x  Lentils
        x  Celery
        x  Onion
        x  Garlic
        x  Cumin
        x  Thyme
 
  This is of general interest, so I'll post it.  I, too, was recently
  given a giant zucchini, big enough to effectively bludgeon someone.
  (ironically enough, I got it in a butcher shop my dad dragged me in
  to.) I sliced it in half horizontally, scooped out the seeds, and
  stuffed it with cooked rice and lentils and baked it. Put some
  lentils in a pot with water and boil them until barely soft.  Throw
  in some rice and cook until barely done, using as little water as
  possible. Meanwhile, sautee some celery, onion and garlic (not too
  much garlic.) and add that to the rice and lentils, along with some
  ground cumin and thyme. Throw it on the zucchini and bake at around
  350 or 400 until the zucchini is soft. The surface of the stuffing
  will probably get burned and dried out, but you van just brush it
  aside.

      4 oz Grated swiss cheese
      1 x  Light cream
      1 x  Fresh parsley

  butter. Mix this with enough breadcrumbs to "glue or bond" the
  mixture together and then add enough cream to "wet" or keep the
  mixture moist.
   Add cooked rice, and salt & pepper to taste.
   Stuff onion-rice mixture back into onion shells, Garnish with more
  grated swiss and thyme.  Bake under moderate heat just to reheat and
  melt cheese topping.

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
      1 tb Sesame seeds
      1 tb Chopped scallion whites
      4    Cilantro leaves (optional)
 
  FOR THE ORANGE-TAHINI SAUCE:  In a blender or food processor, combine
  all ingredients.  Refrigerate until ready to use.
  
  FOR THE FILLING:  Melt the butter or heat the oil in a medium
  saucepan. Saute the onion until soft, about 10 mins. Add the rice and
  stir to coat with the butter. Add the broth, bring to a boil, cover,
  and simmer over low heat until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed,
  about 45 mins. Let cool to room temperature.
  
  In a large bowl, toss the cooked rice, Orange-Tahini Sauce,
  chickpeas, and raisins together.
  
  Prepare the oranges for stuffing by slicing off the rounded ends so
  that each half stands squarely on a plate. Using a paring knife,
  carve out the fruit, cut it into bite-size sections, and toss it into
  the rice mixture. Once the fruit has been removed, cut away as much
  of the white portion of the peel as possible, leaving the shell
  intact.
  
  Set the orange shells on a serving dish and fill them with the rice
  mixture.  Garnish each with a sprinkling of sesame seeds and scallions
  topped with a whole cilantro leaf.

  A lot of trouble, but a conversation piece when finished. Old time
  cooks called these and stuffed whole fruits "mangoes." They were
  favorites in English-American homes because the flavor is superb with
  baked ham, game, roast pork, and with baked beans. Serve whole as a
  salad, or slice and use as garnish.
  
  Wash all vegetables thoroughly before chopping; drain peppers; cut
  off tops and save; remove seeds and membranes. Cover tops and peppers
  with water and bring to boiling; boil gently 10 minutes, or until
  almost tender. Drain, and let cool.  Combine chopped vegetables. Mix
  remaining ingredients; pour over vegetables and mix well. Stuff into
  peppers, do not pack too tightly. Place top on each pepper.  Tie in
  place with string. Place peppers in wide mouthed jars or in a large
  crock or jar. Heat together in agate or enamel kettle all of the
  following ingredients except olive oil.
  
  3 pints cider vinegar 1 quart water 1/2 cup salt 1 Tbsp. celery seeds
  1 1/2 Tbsp. mustard seeds 4 Tbsp. whole cloves 2 Tbsp. whole allspice
  1 (three inch) stick cinnamon, broken 2 blades mace, or 1 Tsp. ground
  mace Olive oil
  
  Bring spice mixture to boiling; pour over stuffed peppers. Let cool.
  To each 3 peppers in jar or crock add about 1/2 cup olive oil. Cover.
  Let stand in cool place 10 days or longer before using. To serve,
  remove string, drain stuffed peppers.
  
  Note:  Use remaining oil and spice mixture in salad dressings or for
  marinade.

  Remove from the heat and stir in half of the Parmesan cheese.  Coat
  two 9-inch square baking pans with nonstick cooking spray. Spread the
  polenta evenly in the two pans. Place the pans in the freezer for 20
  minutes to chill.

  occasionally.  Add the cooked ground beef, tomatoes, tomato paste, and
  seasonings.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and cook for
  15 minutes.
  
  Preheat the oven to 450F.  When the polenta has chilled, spread half
  of the meat sauce evenly over one layer in pan. Top with half of the
  mozzarella and half the remaining Parmesan cheese. With your fingers,
  loosen the edges of the polenta in the other pan. Invert the second
  pan over the first so that the drops out into place.. Spread evenly
  with the remaining sauce and sprinkle with the remaining cheeses.

 Categories: Potatoes
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      8 oz White potatoes; peeled
      2    Poblano chiles; stemmed,
           -seeded,
           Peeled, and finely chopped,
           -about 2/3 cup
      4 pn Bacon
    1/4 c  Chorizo
      1 tb Olive oil
    1/2 c  Queso fresco; or monterey
           -jack
           Cheese, grated
    1/2 c  Sour cream
    1/2 c  Queso panela; or feta cheese
 
  Recipe by: James W. Peyton, El Norte Cookbook (Cuisine of No. Simmer
  the peeled potatoes in water to cover until they are soft enough to
  pierce fairly easily with a skewer except toward the center. This
  will take about 20 minutes.
  
  Remove the potatoes from the water and when they are cool enough to
  handle slice a 1/4-inch piece lengthwise from one side to create a
  level surface.
  
  Using a paring knife and medium-sized spoon, cut and scoop out the
  interiors of the potatoes from the flattened side, leaving a 1/4- to
  1/3 inch wall all around. It is important that the interior portion
  of the potatoes, which is removed and which will be the stuffing, be
  firm and cut into fairly equal-sized pieces of 1/2 inch. Place the
  chopped potato centers in a bowl and add the chopped poblano chiles.
  
  Heat a skillet over medium heat and fry the bacon until it is crisp;
  then remove and reserve it. Fry the chorizo until it is golden and
  remove and reserve it. Toss the oil with the chopped potato centers
  and chiles and fry until the potatoes are crisp and golden brown;
  then place them in a bowl.
  
  Chop the bacon and add it and the chorizo to the potato/chile mixture
  and allow it to come to room temperature. Stir in the queso fresco or
  Monterey Jack cheese and the sour cream.
  
  Fill the reserved potato shells with the above mixture and bake until
  they are hot and cooked through, about 25 to 30 minutes. Place
  potatoes on serving plates and sprinkle on the queso panela or feta
  cheese. Serve with broiled meats or poultry.

      Title: STUFFED QUAIL
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2    Quail

MMMMM--------------------------STUFFING-------------------------------
      2    Carrots, finely chopped
      1 sm Onion, finely chopped
    100 g  Lean pork, finely chopped
    1/2 c  Chopped mixed herbs
           -(parsley,oregano,rosemary)
           Salt and pepper
    100 ml Vin Santo (Italian dessert
           -wine)
 
  Place stuffing ingredients in a flat dish and steam gently in the
  oven at about 250'C for 15 min. Allow to cool for about 10 min, then
  add a beaten egg and process until a thick paste is produced.
  
  Take a boned quail and spread it out, skin side down on a board.
  Season with freshly ground black pepper and place half of the
  stuffing on the bird. Reshape the bird around the stuffing and tie in
  place with either string or cocktail sticks. Repeat with the other
  bird. Place both birds in the dish used for cooking the stuffing. Dot
  with butter and cook in a moderately hot oven for about 40 min, until
  golden brown. Serve with freshly steamed veg and spuds, to rapturous
  applause!
  
  Boning those quail.
  
  If you can find a butcher stupid enough to do this then I would
  recommend this, however if you can't it is fiddly, but not difficult,
  and definately worthwhile. Place the bird, breast down on a board and
  cut along the back bone, from end to end. Pull the skin and meat back
  away from the bone. When you reach the joints for the legs and wings
  use a heavy knife to break the joint. The bone should pop out of the
  sockets fairly easily. Keep pulling the meat off the breast bone,
  using a knife if neccesary. Finally you should be able to remove the
  backbone, ribcage, and brest bone as one. The leg and wing bones can
  be left in place, and in fact help maintain shape during reforming,
  and cooking. This took me about 20 minutes for the first one, and
  about half as long for the second.
  
  I haven't done an in depth study but it would seem that this recipe is
  fairly low in fat, especially if you leave the wine out and replace
  it with stock? (chicken??, veg?). It is also cheap at less than three
  pounds per head. Enjoy!

      Title: STUFFED SHRIMP WITH BACON
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
     12 lg Shrimp (the
           -larger the better)
      1 lb Mozzarella
           -(low-moisture)
      1 lb Bacon (as little
           -fat as possible)
 
  Steam shrimp lightly, just about 30-60 seconds after they begin to
  turn orange.  Plunge shrimp into ice water to cool. Do this
  immediately. Peel and butterfly the shrimp.
  
  Cut the mozzarella into strips that are a little smaller than the
  shrimp. Put mozzarella in shrimp and (this is important) roll shrimp
  from tail to head while it is open (butterflied). This keeps the
  cheese from leaking.
  
  Wrap shrimp-cheese roll in 1/2 slice of bacon and put on skewer. Cook
  on grill or barbecue, over moderate heat, until bacon looks done.
  
  When shrimp are butterflied, cut them almost all the way through so
  they can lay flat when open. This makes them easier to roll. The fire
  will flare up due to bacon fat. Turn the skewers often to cook
  evenly. The bacon should be slightly charred when done. The reason
  why the shrimp are cooked lightly first is that they tend to cook
  slower than the bacon.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A high-cholesterol appetizer with shrimp, cheese and bacon. Yield:
  Serves 2-4.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 5 minutes cooking.

      Title: STUFFED SQUID WITH CHOCOLATE SAUCE
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1 lb Squid, cleaned, dried
    1/2 lb Ground pork
           Olive oil
      1    Onion, finely diced
      1 sm Carrot, finely diced
      2    Garlic cloves, minced
      2    Parsley sprigs, minced
    1/4 c  Bread crumbs
    1/2 c  Pine nuts, lightly toasted
           Salt, pepper
      1 c  Fish, shellfish or chicken
           -stock
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
     10    To 12 almonds, blanched,
           -roasted
      1 oz Lbarra brand chocolate,
           -coarsely grated (see note)
      2 sl Fried crustless French bread
           -(not sourdough)
 
  Adapted from "Catalan Cuisine " by Colman Andrews.
  
  Remove heads and tentacles from squid and set bodies aside. Mince
  heads and tentacles, then mix well with the ground pork (may use a
  food processor).
  
  Heat about 1/2 inch of olive oil in a cassola (like a cazuela, the
  straight-sided pottery vessel used for paella and other dishes in
  Spain) or large skillet and saute the onion, carrot, garlic and
  parsley in it until the onions are wilted; add the pork mixture,
  crumbs and half the pine nuts, mixing together well and cooking until
  the meat is well done. Season to taste with salt and pepper, then
  remove mixture from pan and drain on paper towels or in a colander.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  
  When the pork mixture is cool, lightly stuff the reserved squid
  bodies with it (do not overstuff, or the squid will shrink and tear
  during cooking). Bake the squid in a single layer, uncovered, in a
  lightly oiled baking dish for about 20 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, deglaze the cassola with the stock and wine, simmering
  until it is reduced by about half. While the liquid reduces, put the
  almonds, remaining pine nuts, chocolate and fried bread in a mortar
  and pound with a pestle until finely ground, then moisten with a bit
  of the liquid to make a thick paste (it must be fine, without grainy
  texture). Add this mixture to the reduced liquid, stir in well,
  return to the boil and season to taste. Pour over the stuffed squid,
  or spoon onto serving plates and set the squid on top of the sauce.
  
  Note: lbarra chocolate is sweetened and flavored with almonds and
  cinnamon and is available in many markets in the Bay Area.

MMMMM-------------------HAVE READY TO PREPARE------------------------
      5 lg To 6 Garlic cloves, cleaned
           Ginger root (fresh)
      4 lg To 5 lg Bell Peppers,*
      3 lg To 4 lg Tomatoes,**
 
  * Green or Red, cored and rinsed of seeds ** cored and the insides
  spooned out into bowl 3. PREPARATION: In a large frying pan, heat pan
  and add olive oil. Press 2 cloves of garlic into oil, and stir. When
  it begins to cook, add Bowl #2 (carrots). Stir carefully, and when it
  stops spitting, add Bowl #1. Add soy to taste to mixture and toss.
  Let cook until onions start to clarify, stirring frequently. Add the
  fresh tomato bowl (Bowl #3) and stir until tomatoes are tender. Add
  the cooked tomatoes and juice, and stir in well. While cooking, grate
  the ginger, add the remaining garlic (crushed). When mixture begins
  to dry, add the spaghetti sauce, a dash of nutmeg, a dash of five
  spice powder, pepper, and the taco sauce mixture. Stir in the powder
  well. Let the sauce cool for a few minutes on simmer, and taste. Add
  crushed red peppers to desired taste, but sauce should be hot. I used
  about a 1/2 tsp. Add enough water to make it mix well, and add the
  meat (Bowl #4). Reduce until semi-thick while stirring (or it will
  stick) Let it cool for a few moments. Mix equal amounts of rice and
  sauce in a bowl, about 3 Tbsp for each item to be stuffed. Stuff the
  tomatoes and peppers carefully, trying to fill all gaps. Arrange on
  pan that fits them, and bake at 350 degrees for about a half hour. Be
  careful to fill them completely, but not overfill, the idea being
  that they should not leak any of the sauce. When done, the skins will
  be wrinkled and lighter in color, but still have some crunch. Serve
  with extra unused sauce as a toping. The baked sauce will be far less
  spicy than the origional sauce. Sauce can also be served over rice.

      Title: STUFFED TURNIPS IN CIDER
 Categories: Fruits, Harned 1994, Herb/spice, Side dish, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 md Turnips
      1 md Red bell pepper
           Salt and pepper; to taste
      2 tb Fresh tarragon or
    1/2 ts Dried tarragon
    1/2 ts Fresh thyme, packed, or
    1/4 ts Dried thyme (scant ts.)
      8 oz Lean ground lamb
      2 tb Dried currants
      1 sm Onion; peeled and minced
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 lg Egg; lightly beaten
      1 sl White bread; crumbled
      1 tb Unsalted butter
      2 c  Extra-dry apple cider
      1    Bay leaf
    1/2 c  Heavy (whipping) cream*
           Rice (opt'l.)
 
  *If you want to serve these turnips over rice, increase the amount of
  cream to 1 cup, so there will be plenty of sauce to moisten the rice.
  
  Preheat the broiler.
  
  Peel the turnips.  Using a melon baller or a stiff vegetable peeler,
  hollow them out, leaving the sides and bottom approximately 3/8"
  thick. Reserve the turnip pulp for another use, such as adding to a
  soup or salad. Blanch the turnip shells in boiling salted water to
  cover until they have softened slightly, 2 to
        3    minutes.  Drain; set aside.
  
  Place the red pepper on a piece of aluminum foil under the broiler and
  roast it, turning it as the skin blisters and turns black, which will
  take 15 minutes. Remove the pepper from the broiler, wrap it in the
  foil, and set it aside to steam, 10 to 15 minutes. When it is cool
  enough to handle, peel it and remove the membranes and the seeds. Cut
  the pepper into 1/2" wide strips.
  
  Line each hollowed-out turnip with three strips of red pepper, then
  season with salt and pepper.  DIce any remaining pepper strips.
  
  Mince the tarragon and thyme.  In a medium-size bowl, combine the
  lamb, currants, onion, herbs, cinnamon, salt and pepper. Add the egg,
  bread and diced pepper; mix well. To check the seasoning, saute a
  teaspoonful of the filling in a small pan over medium-high heat.
  Adjust seasoning to taste. Fill the turnips with the stuffing,
  mounding it slightly at the top.
  
  Melt butter in a medium-size saucepan over medium-high heat. When it
  is foaming but not smoking, brown the turnips on all sides. (This is
  a bit tricky because the turnips tend to roll around, but it is
  possible and does make a big difference to the dish.)
  
  When the turnips have browned, set them upright in the pan; pour the
  cider around them.  Add the bay leaf and bring the cider to a boil.
  Reduce heat to low, cover the pan, and let simmer until the stuffing
  is cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes.  Remove the turnips from the pan
  and arrange them on a serving dish.  Cover with aluminum foil and
  keep warm in a low (200 F.) oven.
  
  Reduce cooking liquid by one third over medium-high heat, 5 minutes.
  Then whisk in the cream and continue to cook until the sauce has
  thickened slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, and
  pour around the turnips.  Serve immediately.
  
  1987 Caymus Cabernet Sauvignon goes well with this.

      Title: STUFFED VENISON PINWHELLS
 Categories: Meats, Wild game
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2    Whole venison backstraps,
           Rolled out 1/4 in. thick
      1 qt Whole milk
      2 ts Wild game seasoning
      1 lb Velveeta cheese
      1 cn Rotel tomatoes with diced
           Chiles
      2 lb Thinly sliced lean bacon
    1/2 c  Thinly sliced green onions
      8    Cloves garlic, finely mince
 
  First, prepare the backstrap fillet. It's an extremely tender tubelike
  piece of meat about 12 inches long and 2 to 3 inches in diameter. And
  because of its shape, it can be cut around the perimeter, 1/4 inch
  thick, and rolled out flat. To do this, you need a very sharp knife.
  Start by laying out the fillet perpendicular to your body and making
  a shallow slice about 1/4 inch deep in the meat. Then, as if slicing
  through and unrolling paper towels from a roll, begin working around
  the outside perimeter of the fillet until the backstrap comes out
  looking like a round steak. It takes a little practice to do ... but
  you can do it! When the meat is ready, place both pieces into a glass
  or plastic container and cover them with whole milk. You want to
  marinate the venison for at least 6 hours, but preferably overnight.
  The milk tenderizes the deer and helps to remove any unwanted gamey
  flavor. After the marination process, remove the meat from the milk
  (you can discard the milk), and pat the venison dry with several
  paper towels. Then liberally sprinkle both sides with wild game
  seasoning and rub it briskly into the meat. At this point, preheat
  your oven to 400 degrees. Then, in your food processor, mix together
  the Velveeta cheese and the Rotel tomatoes until smooth and creamy.
  When you're ready to make the pinwheels, spread a thin layer of the
  cheese mixture evenly over one side of the deer. Then place a layer
  of bacon strips - side by side - on top of the cheese. Finish up the
  preparation by lightly sprinkling on a little sliced green onions and
  a little minced garlic. Now tightly roll up the flattened fillets and
  set them aside momentarily. Then on the same work surface, lay out
  another 8 to 10 strips of bacon side by side and put one of the
  rolled backstraps on top of them. Now wrap the bacon strips around
  the venison and pin them in place with toothpicks. When you are
  finished, the backstrap should be completely encased in bacon strips.
  Repeat with the other backstrap. All that's left is to take a sharp
  knife, slice the rolled venison into 2 inch thick pinwheels, position
  them on a shallow cookie sheet, and bake them - uncovered - in the
  oven for about 40 to 45 minutes. You'll notice that a light sauce
  will form in the bottom of the cookie sheet; you can use this to
  baste the pinwheels as they cook. The one thing you don't want to do
  is overcook the venison - it will come out dry and chewy instead of
  juicy and tender if you do! Chef's Note: If you don't have wild game
  seasoning on hand, you can lightly sprinkle the venison with salt,
  black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and sweet basil as a
  substitute. Unfortunately, most spice manufacturers don't make a
  premixed wild game seasoning, but my company does. If you'd like me
  to send you some, simply call 1-800-742-4231

    1/2 lb Mushrooms
      4 tb Butter
      1 c  Onion, finely chopped
      2 ts Garlic, finely minced
      2 ts Lemon juice
    1/4 ts Thyme (the dried type)
           Salt & freshly ground pepper

      1 c  Bread crumbs, fresh, fine
      2 tb Bread crumbs, fresh, fine
    1/3 c  Parsley, finely chopped
      4 tb Parmesan, fresh grated
      1    Egg yolk
      3 tb Olive oil (extra virgin is
           - best)
 
      Preheat oven to 450F.  Trim off the ends of each zucchini. Cut
  each in half crosswise.  Cut each piece in half lengthwise. Scoop out
  the centers, leaving a shell at least 1/4-inch thick. Reserve and
  finely chop the scooped-out portions.  There should be about 1-1/2
  cups. Pour enough water to cover the shells into a saucepan and boil.
   Add the shells and simmer 2 minutes.  Drain thoroughly. Clean and
  finely chop mushrooms.  There should be about 2 cups. Heat butter in
  heavy skillet and add onions and garlic.  Cook briefly, stirring, and
  add mushrooms and lemon juice.  Stir and cook one minute. Add the
  chopped zucchini, thyme, salt and pepper. Cook about 3 minutes until
  the excess moisture evaporates.
      Spoon and scrape the mixture into a mixing bowl and let cool
  slightly. Add 1 cup of the bread crumbs, the parsley, 2 tablespoons
  of the cheese and blend thoroughly. Stir in the egg yolk.
      With 1 tablespoon of the oil, brush the inside of a baking dish
  big enough to hold the shells in one layer. Spoon an equal portion of
  the filling into each shell and smooth over the top. Blend the
  remaining 2 tablespoons bread crumbs with the remaining 2 tablespoons
  cheese and sprinkle over the top of the stuffed zucchini boats.
  Sprinkle evenly with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil.
      Place the dish in the oven and bake 25 minutes. Serve
  immediately. NOTE FROM ME:  I cut the finished zucchini in half to
  serve more people before "saucing". Recipe from Pierre Franey's

      2 tb Dried parsley
      1 ts Poultry seasonings (I
           Believe this is vegan), more
           To taste
        x  Ground black pepper to
           Taste
        x  Ground sage to taste
      1 lg Bag of Pepperidge Farms
           Whole wheat/white bread mix
           Stuffing
           Cubes (the stuff without any
           Seassonings)
        x  Vegetable broth to add
           Moisture, if needed (about 1
           To 2 cups)
 
  Heat onions, celery, carrots, shrooms and spices/herbs in a large pot
  until it all boils.  Simmer for about 5 ~ 10 minutes or until the
  chopped onions are translucent. Cool for 10 minutes, then add the
  stuffing mix. Mix well, adding vegetable broth if necessary for
  moisture. Place in a big covered baking dish and cook in a pre-heated
  350 oven for 30 minutes. Taking the cover off during the last 10 to
  15 minutes should get you a crusty top for the stuffing.
  
  Variations:  you can probably add some of that vegetarian Italian
  sausage that comes in links (I have some but haven't tried it yet),
  browned first, to the mix for a more traditional taste. And chopped
  apples, chopped spinach or any other vegetable you like can probably
  be added. Even my father-in-law, diehard New Englander and
  meat-and-potatoes man, liked this.

      Title: STUFFING - BREAD LF
 Categories: Low-cal, Side dishes
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Onion finely chopped
  1 1/2 c  Celery (with leaves) chopped
      1 c  Butter Buds
           (or margarine/butter)
      9 c  Bread cubes - soft
      2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 ts Sage
      1 ts Thyme
    1/2 ts Pepper
 
  (Allow 3/4 cup stuffing for each pound of ready-to-cook chicken or
  turkey. A 1- to 1 1/4 pound Rock Cornish hen requires about 1 cup
  stuffing. Allow 1/4 to 1/3 cup stuffing for each rib pork chop and
  about 1/2 cup per pound of dressed fish. This recipe makes enough for
  a 12-pound turkey.)
  
  Cook and stir onion and celery in Butter Buds (or margarine/butter) in
  10-inch skillet until onion is tender. Stir in about 1/3 of the bread
  cubes. Turn into deep bowl. Add remaining ingredients; toss. Stuff
  turkey just before roasting. If desired, bake the stuffing mixture
  separately in a casserole, covered, in a 325 degree F oven for 40 to
  45 minutes or in a 375 degree F oven for 20 to 30 minutes.
  
  Stuffing temperatures should reach at least 165 degrees F. To check,
  insert a meat thermometer through the body cavity into the thickest
  part of the stuffing and let stand for 5 minutes.
  
  Oyster Stuffing: Decrease bread cubes to 8 cups and add 2 cans (8
  ounces each) oysters, drained and chopped, with the remaining
  ingredients.
  
  Makes 9 cups stuffing.

      Title: STUFFING BALLS
 Categories: Dressings, Holiday
      Yield: 16 Servings
 
      1 x  Turkey giblets
      8 tb Butter
      4    Celery tops
     20 sl Bread
     20 sl Bread, salt rising
     16 oz Pepperidge Farm stuffing
      2 c  Chicken stock
      2    Onions, chopped
      2 c  Chicken stock
 
  Boil giblets, butter, and celery tops until done. Toast breads, then
  break toast into small pieces.  Add Pepperidge Farm stuffing to
  toast. Cook chopped onions in stock. When tender, add to bread mix.
  If dressing is too dry, add chicken stock for additional moisture.
  Preheat oven to 350. Form into serving-size balls and place in
  buttered baking dish. Spoon additional broth over balls. Bake 1 hour
  or until brown.
  
  This dressing is moist and is very easy to serve.  If I have too much
  for Thanksgiving I freeze uncooked balls and use them at Christmas
  which helps speed up dinner that busy day. I hope that your kids will
  like this recipe; mine always liked the balls.
  
  The one secret to my dressing is Salt Rising bread. My Grandmother
  always used it with other bread (we had to keep it a secret because
  my father hated salt rising even though you can not tell is is in
  there). I also have a hard time making just a little dressing and it
  always looks like I'm fixing for an army.

      Title: SUB-JEE
 Categories: Indian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/4 lb Fresh mushrooms, sliced
      1 sm Head cauliflower, cut into
           -florets
      4 md Red or white potatoes
      1 c  Chopped yellow onion
      1 c  Sliced celery
      1    Finely minced jalapeno
           -pepper (see note)
      1 tb Finely minced fresh cilantro
      2 ts Ground cumin
      2 ts Curry powder
      1    Or 2 cloves garlic, minced
    1/2    To 1 teaspoon salt
    1/4    To 1/2 teaspoon ground
           -coriander
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
      1 ds Ground cinnamon
      3 c  Canned and/or homemade
           -chicken broth
      6    To 8 flour tortillas
      2 c  Shredded Monterey jack
           -cheese, optional
      3    Tomatoes, diced
      1 c  Sour cream
 
  Okey dokey. I'll make amends with this Indian "peasant" dish... Be
  warned, though. This is from an article about "ugly" food--stuff that
  looks wretched but tastes great.
  
  Don't take the list of ingredients and amounts too seriously,
  although the potatoes and cauliflower are essential. But the main
  idea with Sub-Jee is to use what vegetables you have or truly love.
  And play with the seasonings a bit to strike a balance between fire
  and flavor.
  
  In a large heavy pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add
  mushrooms and saute until they release their juices and begin to
  brown. Stir in cauliflower, potatoes, onion, celery, jalapeno,
  cilantro, cumin, curry, garlic, salt, coriander, cayenne, cinnamon
  and broth.
  
  Cover the pot and braise the mixture over medium heat for about 20 to
  30 minutes, or until the vegetables are very tender.
  
  To serve, heat the flour tortillas one at a time in a dry skillet
  until they are soft and pliable, turning once. Sprinkle with a little
  of the grated cheese and keep the tortilla in the pan until the
  cheese begins to melt. Have each diner spoon some of the vegetable
  mixture down the center of a tortilla, then top with diced fresh
  tomatoes and a dollop of sour cream. To eat, roll the tortilla around
  the filling, burrito fashion. Wonderful!
  
  Note: When preparing fresh chilies, wear rubber gloves for protection
  against oils that later can cause burning sensation on skin.

  1 1/8 c  Lard

  In large bowl, sift together all dry ingredients. Blend well. With
  pastry blender, cut in shortening until evenly distributed. Mixture
  will resemble cornmeal in texture.  Store in large airtight container
  in cool, dry place. Use within 10-12 weeks. Sylvia's comments: I
  mixed this up in my Osterizer, rather than cutting the shortening in
  by hand. Worked great, all I had to do was manually turn the bowl the
  opposite of the way it wanted to go a few times. Worked fine in
  recipes, too.

      5 c  Flour
    1/4 c  Baking powder
    1/2 tb Salt
      1 c  Shortening
 
  Sift dry ingredients together in large bowl.  With two knives, a
  pastry blender, or your food processor, cut shortening in in
  spoonsful until mixture is texture of course cornmeal. If you are
  using a food processor, start and stop often during processing and
  watch it closely.
  
  Keep mix stored in labeled, tightly closed container. It will keep on
  a pantry shelf 1-6 months in dry weather. In very hot, humid weather,
  it's a good idea to keep mix in refrigerator.
  
  Sylvia's comments:  I mixed this up in my Osterizer stand mixer
  instead of hand-cutting or using a food processor. I did have to
  manually turn it against the way it wanted to go a few times, but
  that was it. I used a very low speed.  I have used this substitute in
  a biscuit recipe, and it worked fine.

      Title: SUCCOTASH SNACKS
 Categories: Crackers
      Yield: 55 Servings
 
      1 c  Lima bean flour (available
           At health food or specialty
           Stores)
      1 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Corn meal
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/3 c  Vegetable shortening
    2/3 c  Water
 
  "Lima beans and corn are a traditional combination which works very
  well in these crispy thin crackers. Served with a hearty bowl of
  soup, they are a lunch in themselves. 325~F. 25 to 30 minutes Preheat
  the oven to 325~F.
  
  Stir together the flours, corn meal, salt, and sugar in a large bowl
  or in the food processor. Cut in the shortening until the mixture
  resembles coarse meal.
  
  Blend in enough of the water to form a dough that will hold together
  in a cohesive ball. Divide the dough into 2 portions for rolling.
  Roll out to 1/16 to 1/8 inch. Cut into 2-inch shapes and place on an
  ungreased baking sheet. Prick each one 2 or 3 times with the tines of
  a fork.
  
  Bake for 15 minutes. Turn over and continue baking another 10 to 15
  minutes, or until medium brown. Cool on a rack. Yield: 50-55.
  
  VARIATION: For a coarser texture and different taste, try substituting
  whole millet for the corn meal.

      Title: SUCCULENT SALMON  (C) 1992 GEORGE GILDER
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
     10 oz Salmon fillet
           (remove the skin)
      2 md Red potatoes
      1 lg Onions, sliced 1/4 inch
      8    Baby carrots or 8 carrot
           Sections, cut into 2"
           Pieces
    1/4 c  Fresh orange juice
           Broccoli, cut into florets
      1 tb Olive oil
    1/4 ts Thyme
    1/2 ts Basil
      1 pk Herb-ox low salt
           Chicken stock mix
           Salt, pepper,to taste
 
  This is a new adaptation from a series of fish recipes I developed for
  "people who don't like fish". The stock and juice combined with the
  onion add a distinctive savory flavor. The combination makes it hard
  to distinguish the individual flavors. This dinner takes less than
  ten minutes to complete.
  
  Cut the potatoes into one quarter inch slices and place into a pan of
  cold water. Turn pot on high until it starts to boil. Add the carrots
  after three minutes. Salt the water and reduce heat to medium. Cook
  until tender, about six to seven minutes. Add broccoli about 2
  minutes before the potatoes are finished. Drain if finished before
  the fish, and place back in hot pan. Add fresh pepper.
  
  Saute onions in one half the oil, med-low heat in a ten inch teflon
  pan. When they start to brown add the rest of oil. Place the fish
  fillet on top fat side down and turn up heat to med- high. Saute
  until salmon turns white on bottom. Add herbs and pepper. Add one
  quarter cup of water, chicken stock and the orange juice. Lower heat
  and simmer about five minutes. Baste occasionally. The salmon should
  be pink inside and not over done.
  
  Cut the filet in half in the pan. Using a plastic spatula, pick up
  the fish and onions and place in one half of plate. Add a spoon or
  two of sauce. Add vegetables and arrange in semi-circle.

      1    Free Flow Recipe
 
  The next few recipes are from a big, fat cookbook that would be
  several volumes if they had not used the somewhat unappealing format
  in which the recipes are presented. The book is pretty no frills,
  with little background given for the dishes.  Almost everything that
  I've tried from the book has been good, though. Here we get into some
  hard- core, no-fooling Chinese vegetarian recipes.  The book has a
  lot of vegetarian stuff in it, as well as recipes tailored for
  diabetics and those with ulcer problems. It's actually pretty easy to
  use once you get used to the odd format.
  
  A. 1 tablespoon peanut oil B. 4 large mushrooms C. 1 cup finely
  shredded bamboo shoots D. 2 teaspoons light soy sauce E. 1/2 teaspoon
  sugar F. 1/2 teaspoon salt G. 1 tablespoon mushroom water H. 1 1/2
  teaspoons cornstarch I. 1 teaspoon sugar J. 2 teaspoons light soy
  sauce K. 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil L. 1/2 teaspoon salt M. 1
  tablespoons mushroom water N. 4 pieces fresh bean curd skin O. 2 cups
  peanut oil
  
  PREPARATION:
  
  I.  Wash B and soak in warm water for 15 minutes; drain and save
  water; shred B very fine.
  
  II.  Mix D,E,F,G.
  
  III.  Mix H,I,J,K,L,M.
  
  COOKING: 1. Heat A, add B, stir-fry a few seconds, add C, mix well.
  
  2.  Add D-G, stir well and cook for 1 minute.
  
  3.  Dip pastry brush into H-M and brush 1 piece of N generously.
  
  4.  Spread 1/4 of A-G on top; place second piece of N over this; brush
  again with H-M and spread 1/4 A-G over this.
  
  5.  Repeat procedure until fourth layer is finished.
  
  6.  Fold into a 2-to 3-inch roll; place on a plate and steam over
  boiling water for 10 minutes; cool completely
  
  7.  Heat O to 375F; deep fry A-N until golden brown (1 to 2 minutes),
  cool. Slice and serve as hors d'oeuvres or serve with rice.

           Onions, broccoli, spinach,
           Corn, etc (whatever takes
           Your fancy)
 
  L/F or F/F Cheese (optional) - approx 250 ml (1 cup)
  
  Custard 150 ml milk (approx 1/4 pint) 2 eggs (I use 1 egg & 1 egg
  white) 30 ml (1 heaped tablespoon) flour (ordinary white/ww flour;
  corn flour; potato flour, etc) pinch of mixed herbs black pepper to
  taste
  
  1) Heat oven to 180 C (350 F).  Spray a quiche dish with non-stick
  baking spray.
  
  2) Place fillings in dish & sprinkle cheese over.
  
  3) Place custard ingredients in bowl (in order they are given above)
  & beat well to get rid of any lumps.
  
  4) Pour custard mixture over fillings & bake in oven until set
  (approx 35 mins)
  
  I normally cook mine in the microwave (50 to 70 % power for approx 15
  mins) until custard is set - if necessary I brown it off in the oven
  for approx 5 mins.
  
  The above quantities are enough for  a standard size quiche dish
  (approx 25 cm in diameter).  I normally double the ingredients and
  put into a rectangular casserole dish.

      Title: SUFGANIYOT
 Categories: Israeli, Holiday, Doughnuts
      Yield: 24 Doughnuts
 
    1/2 c  Margarine
      1 c  Flour
      1 tb Sugar
      4    Eggs
      2 qt Vegetable oil for frying
     12 oz Fruit preserves
    1/4 c  Confectioners' sugar
 
  Sufganiyot are small, jelly-filled doughnuts traditionally served in
  Israel during Hanukkah. The doughnuts are fried in oil, symbolizing
  the miracle that occurred when one day's worth of sacred oil burned
  for eight days when the Maccabees returned to their ransacked temple
  in Jerusalem some 2,100 years ago.
  
  1. Place margarine and 1 cup water in a small saucepan over
  medium-high heat. Bring to a boil. Stir in flour and sugar. Cook,
  stirring vigorously, just until mixture forms a ball. Remove from
  heat.
  
  2. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Stir until smooth and well-blended.
  
  3. Heat oil in a medium saucepan over high heat until it reaches 380
  degrees as measured on a deep-fat frying thermometer. Adjust heat
  while making pastries to maintain the 380-degree temperature.
  
  4. Carefully drop batter by slightly rounded tablespoonfuls into hot
  oil. Fry until puffed and golden brown on all sides, about 2 minutes.
  
  5. Using a slotted spoon, remove from oil and drain on paper towels.
  Remove to wire racks to cool completely.
  
  6. Fill a pastry bag, fitted with a filling tip, with preserves.
  Insert tip into each doughnut and squeeze about 1/2 tablespoon of
  filling into each.
  
  7. Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve. Sufganiyot do not store
  well, so are best eaten the day they are made.

 Categories: Fish, Main dish
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Gin
    1/3 c  Brown sugar
      3 tb Coarse salt
  1 1/2 tb Mixed pickling spice
      1 ts Anise seed, bruised*
      1 ts Dil seed, bruised*
  1 1/2 lb Salmon filet
 
  At least 2 hours and up to 6 hours before you plan to smoke the fish,
  combine marinade ingrdients in a bowl. Place salmon in a plastic bag
  or shallow dish, pour marinade over it, and refrigerate it for at
  least 1 hour.
  
  Bring your smoker to its appropriate cooking temperature.
  
  Remove salmon from refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature
  for 30 minutes.  Drain salmon, reserving marinade. Leave any clinging
  spices on the surface of the salmon.
  
  Transfer salmon to smoker, skin-side down, and drizzle marinade (with
  some of the whole spices) generously over fish. Smoke it until just
  cooked through and flaky, about 45 to 55 minutes at a temperature of
  225 to 250F.
   Have a large spatula and platter ready when you take the salmon off
  the smoker, since it will be fragile when done.
  
  Transfer salmon to the serving platter.  Serve it hot or chilled with
  some of the whole spices clinging to the fish.
  
  *Bruising technique:  Bruising spices means to almost ~ but not quite
  ~ crush the whole spice seeds or pods. by pressing on the spices with
  a pestle or the side of a knife, you release the natural oils, making
  the seasonings more flavorful.

      Title: SUGAR CURED HAM
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 pt Jefferson Island Salt or can
      2 tb Black pepper
      1 tb Ground red pepper
 
  We raise hogs and salt or sugar cure our hams and bacon. You will need
  FRESH hams, preferably from a salughter house as these are fresher
  than those available at grocery stores. You will need the above
  ingredients FOR EACH JOINT (local name for ham or shoulder.) To cure
  two hams, double the ingredients. Mix all above and rub well into
  meat, filling hole in end of the bone.  Wrap in brown paper and place
  in a cloth sack. Hang hock (small end) down. Time will cure it.
  Additional details: Should be hung in a cool (around 40 degrees)
  place.  That's why before refrigeration hogs were only killed in the
  winter.
    If you are curing without refrigeration, try to do it when the
  temperature will remain from 35 to 50 degrees for at least the first
  three days. After that it's okay if it goes up or down more. You can
  hang the meat in an old refrigerator to cure it or if you are curing
  outside and the temp goes haywire, you can move it to the refrig.
  Needless to day, if you are hanging the meat in an out building or
  garage, hang it high enough to keep it out of the reach of dogs.
  They do love fresh ham. The ham should hang for at least 6 month (I
  prefer a year) before being cut. If you want to smoke the ham, it is
  best to wait about three months from hanging before doing it.
     Be aware that you may loose a ham.  By that I do not mean that
  someone will steal it, though, I suppose that is possible. I mean
  that it may ruin. That's one of the chances you take. We've lost a
  few but most of them have been salted down rather than sugar cured.
  It is possible to sugar cure bacon in your refrigerator using Morton
  Sugar Cure (using recipe on bag) and then smoke it. It's GREAT! Much
  better than what you buy in the store. Yes, I can just hear all the
  health food people groaning at all this talk of ham and bacon and
  smoke. Ah, cholesteral (sp?) and salt and cancer causing smoke! May
  not be good for you but 99.9% of all taste buds will vote for it!

 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Egg-shaped mold
        pk Granulated sugar
           Water
           Food coloring
           Icing
 
  1. Mix a little water with the granulated sugar to make it wet enough
  to pack. Scoop the wet sugar into each half of plastic egg mold.
  
  2. Stiffly turn filled egg mold upside-down on several layers on paper
  towel and remove egg mold.
  
  3. Using a spoon, scoop out a half circle from one side of each sugar
  egg, making sure that when the two sides are put together, the
  scooped out sections will match. If you want your sugar egg to stand
  you will want to cut away the bottom end of the sugar egg. Let dry
  overnight or until surface of sugar eggs are hard.
  
  4. When outer side of sugar eggs are hard, turn and scoop out inside
  leaving the shell to measure about 1/4" in thickness.
  
  5. Seam together the two egg halves using cake icing. Decorate around
  seam and around hole opening to conceal rough edges. Finish
  decorating sugar eggs and fill with your favorite candies.
  
  Optional:
  
  * Color water with food coloring before mixing with sugar.
  
  * Use cake decorating confections for decorating.
  
  * Soak shredded coconut in green food coloring for grass.

      Title: SUGAR SYRUP
 Categories: Alcohol, Beverages, Info/tips
      Yield: 1 Cup
 
      1 c  White granulated sugar
    1/2 c  Water
 
  Sugar syrup is used to make homemade liqueurs. To make, the ratio is
  1 part sugar to 2 parts water. Boil together for about 5 minutes at a
  full boil and be sure the sugar is dissolved. The syrup >>MUST<< be
  cool BEFORE adding the alcohol mixture as heat evaporates the
  alcohol. PROPORTIONS: One cup syrup plus three cups 80 proof vodka
  equals 60 proof liqueur. Two cups syrup plus three cups 80 proof
  vodka equals 48 proof liqueur. If a 100 proof vodka is used, increase
  the sugar syrup by 1/8 cup. For a "creme de" liqueur, double the
  amount of syrup called for in the recipe. The greater the amount
  added, the lower the alcoholic content. Sugar syrup should be
  adjusted to personal preference and to the outcome of the liqueur's
  taste since variation can occur. See recipes for the following
  Liqueurs: Banana, Blueberry, Cherry, Cranberry, Orange, Papaya, Pear,
  Peach, Apricot, Raspberry, Plum, Pineapple, Chocolate, Hazlenut,
  Irish Cream, Coconut, Coffee, Orange and Coffee Bean Cordial, Almond,
  Almond Tasty, Tea, Vanilla Cream, Vanilla Pecan, Ginger, Licorice,
  Cimmamon, Peppermint, Spicy Herbal. NOTE: Health food stores will
  have the best selection for many of the ingredients. Frozen, canned
  or dry fruits may be used BUT flavors will often not be as full.
  Herbs, nuts, and extracts may be added and/or substituted in recipes
  creating an endless variety of combinations. Try a few basic recipes
  before experimenting to develop a feel for proportions. Liqueurs
  should mature as indicated in the recipe before drinking. Storing
  tends to round out the taste and flavor. Be sure to keep a record of
  ingredients, amounts, time aged, etc. for troubleshooting and to
  assure you can repeat the recipe. Batches may vary for a variety of
  reasons, such as the freshness of fruit, aging time, etc. TIPS/INFO:
  ~ Herb and spice flavorings are very potent so begin with a small
  amount -
      1/4    teaspoon to 2 teaspoons ~ Nuts and herbs MUST be crushed or
  broken to release full flavor - Be sure to scrape off all the white
  rind on orange or lemon peels or a
    bitter taste will result ~ Blot peels on paper towels to dry off
  oils and water ~ Ripeness of fruit can affect the final outcome of
  taste - If too weak, add more flavoring and resteep or try 1/4
  teaspoon extract - To sweeten, the ratio is approximately 1 ounce to
  4 ounces - If sour or bitter, add more sugar syrup - If too sweet,
  add a bit of lemom and resteep for a week - To thicken, add glycerine
  (1 or 2 teaspoons per quart) which is
    available at most drugstores and winemaking shops ~ Strain and then
  filter liqueur once it has aged. To strain, first use a
    regular strainer and then restrain the fruits and nuts. Squeeze out
  as
    much juice as possible. FINALLY, filter the strained juice to
  achieve a
    clean finsihed product. Place a coffee filter or a paper filter in a
    funnel and pour juice slowly, stirring to prevent clogging. Replace
    filter as required and repeat process if any residue is apparent.

 Categories: Breads, Breakfast
      Yield: 24 Servings

    1/4 c  Warm water
  3 1/2 c  Flour
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Crisco
      2    Eggs beaten
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Sour cream, do not use lite
           -sour cream it is not thick
           Enough
           Vanilla Sugar:
      2 ts Vanilla
  1 1/2 c  Sugar (Can use lessor use
           -left over sugar in
 
  something else.)
  
  Soften yeast in warm water, sift flour and salt in mixing bowl. Cut in
  butter and shortning until size of peas. Blend eggs, sour cream, 1 tsp
  vanilla, yeast and water together. Add to dry mixture gently so that
  you keep the butter in little chunks.
  
  Chill, wrapped in plastic wrap for two hours or up to
        4    days.
  
  Divide into two balls.  For each ball,roll out into a 6 x 12 inch
  rectangle.  Sprinkle with some of the vanilla sugar, fold in thirds,
  turn. Do this three  or four times.Roll out one more time and cut
  into 12 equal strips 1 X 6 inches. Twist, roll in vanilla sugar and
  put on cookie sheet. Do the second ball or save it for another day.
  The recipe makes about 24 twists.
  
  I tried the recipe using "lite" sour cream and it was too sticky. The
  dough should not need any flour because you are using the sugar to
  keep the dough from sticking to the board.
  
  Bake at 375 for 15 to 20 min.These should be lightly browned, do not
  overcook. You will notice that there are little layers of dough with
  sugar in between.

      Title: SUITABLE CONTAINERS~ COVERS~ & WEIGHTS FOR
 Categories: Canning, Pickles, Preserves
      Yield: 1 Text
 
 
  A 1-gallon container is needed for each 5 pounds of fresh vegetables.
  Therefore, a 5-gallon stone crock is of ideal size for fermenting
  about 25 pounds of fresh cabbage or cucumbers. Food-grade plastic and
  glass containers are excellent substitutes for stone crocks. Other 1-
  to 3-gallon non-food-grade plastic containers may be used if lined
  inside with a clean food-grade plastic bag. Caution: Be certain that
  foods contact only food-grade plastics. Do not use garbage bags or
  trash liners. Fermenting sauerkraut in quart and half-gallon Mason
  jars is an acceptable practice, but may result in more spoilage
  losses.
  
  Cabbage and cucumbers must be kept 1 to 2 inches under brine while
  fermenting. After adding prepared vegetables and brine, insert a
  suitably sized dinner plate or glass pie plate inside the
  fermentation container. The plate must be slightly smaller than the
  container opening, yet large enough to cover most of the shredded
  cabbage or cucumbers. To keep the plate under the brine, weight it
  down with 2 to 3 sealed quart jars filled with water. Covering the
  container opening with a clean, heavy bath towel helps to prevent
  contamination from insects and molds while the vegetables are
  fermenting. Fine quality fermented vegetables are also obtained when
  the plate is weighted down with a very large clean, plastic bag
  filled with 3 quarts of water containing 4-1/2 tablespoons of salt.
  Be sure to seal the plastic bag. Freezer bags sold for packaging
  turkeys are suitable for use with 5-gallon containers.
  
  The fermentation container, plate, and jars must be washed in hot
  sudsy water, and rinsed well with very hot water before use.

      Title: SUKSESSTERTE
 Categories: Cake, Desserts
      Yield: 1 Cake
 
      7 oz Almonds
      7 oz Icing/confectioner's
           Sugar
    1/2 ts Baking powder
      5    Egg whites
           Egg cream
      5    Egg yolks
  4 3/8 oz Sugar
    1/2 c  Heavy cream
           (I use 38% butterfat)
      1 ts Gelatine (heaping)
  5 1/3 oz Unsalted butter,
           Room temperature (no
           Margarine, please ; )
           Vanilla, optional
  3 1/2 oz Semisweet chocolate
           (I use Freia's
           Dronningsjokolade)
           Brewed coffee,
           Milk or butter
 
  Grind the almonds. Mix almonds, icing/confectioner's sugar and baking
  powder. Whip the egg whites until they are stiff. Very carefully mix
  the almond-mix with the egg whites ("cut" them in). Bake at 175 C
  (350 F) for app. 30 minutes in a round mould. It should be golden in
  colour, but not brown around the edges.
  
  Let the cake cool. Cut the cake in half horizontally (or make two).
  
  Egg cream:  Heat egg yolks, sugar and cream over low heat until the
  cream thickens. Do not boil. Stir constantly (Do not use a metal
  whisk in an aluminium pot - except for Halloween - the egg cream will
  turn green).
  
  Put the gelatine in water for a few minutes. Then squeeze out excess
  water. Heat in a double boiler until liquid. Mix the gelatine with
  the butter. (Add vanilla if you use it). Stir well. Add this mix to
  the egg cream, a little at the time.
  
  Put the egg cream between the layers of the cake, save some. In a
  double boiler, melt the semisweet chocolate. Put the melted chocolate
  on top of the cake, decorate with the remaining egg cream. If the
  melted chocolate is difficult to work with, add a _little_ brewed
  coffee, milk _or_ butter.
  
  This is a rich cake - it will go a long way!

      Title: SUKUMA WIKI (COLLARD GREENS IN LEMON SAUCE)
 Categories: Other sauce
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Collard greens
  1 3/4 c  Water
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 md Onion -- chopped
      2 md Plum tomatoes -- peel, seed,
           Chop
      1    Serrano chile -- seeded and
           Minced
  2 1/2 tb Fresh lemon juice
      1 tb All-purpose flour
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  In a large sink of lukewarm, agitate the collard greens well to
  remove any hidden grit.  Carefully lift the greens out of the water
  and transfer them to a colander, leaving the grit on the bottom of
  the sink. Repeat the
  
  procedure in a sink of fresh water.  Remove and discard the woody
  stems. Stack the collard leaves a few at a time, and cut them
  crosswise into 1/2-inch wide strips.
  
  Bring 1 cup of the water to a boil in a large skillet. Add the collard
  greens, cover, and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until the
  greens are barely tender, about 10 minutes. Drain the greens well.
  
  Heat the oil in a large skillet.  Add the onion and chile pepper and
  cook over medium heat, stirring often, until softened, about 5
  minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook for 2 minutes.  Stir in the
  drained greens.
  
  In a medium bowl, whisk the remaining 3/4 cup water with the lemon
  juice, flour and salt until smooth. Stir this into the greens, reduce
  the heat to low, and simmer, stirring often, until the sauce has
  thickened and the flour flavor has cooked away, about 3 minutes.
  Serve immediately.
  
  "There are many ways of making this very simple dish," says Maggie
  Marenga. "You can use just onions or just tomatoes. You can use heavy
  cream or half-and-half instead of the water in the lemon sauce. It's
  great with beef or chicken stew.  Some people even put beef or
  chicken in their Sukuma Wiki.  In Kenya, it is eaten on an almost
  daily basis."

  Put onion in large bowl. Cut the ends off the lemon, slice it and add
  to the onion. Add the sugar, sake, and soy sauce; stir well. Rinse
  and pat dry the chicken breasts, put them in the bowl and spoon the
  marinade over them. Marinate them for an hour at room temperature,
  stirring occasionally to be sure that all pieces are more or less
  equally marinated. In a dish or small mixing bowl, thoroughly beat
  the egg. Put the flour in a plastic bag, dip a couple of the chicken
  breasts in the egg and shake them with the flour in the bag to coat
  them. Heat the oil in the pan and add the floured chicken breasts.
  Repeat until all the pieces are coated and in the frypan. Brown the
  chicken on both sides over medium heat (it should take about 20 to 30
  minutes) and then add the marinade and simmer until the chicken is
  well cooked, perhaps another 30 minutes.

      2 tb Fresh Lemon Juice
  1 1/4 ts Tabasco Pepper Sauce
    1/2 ts Salt
      1    Clove Garlic, Cut In Half
      1    Piece Lemon Zest, About 1"
    1/4 c  Vanilla Yogurt
 
  This simple but rather exotic composed salad marries crisp fresh
  vegetables and smooth tofu with a spicy peanut dressing for an
  unusual Indonesian inspired taste.
  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- Steam the beans, cabbage and carrots for 2 to 3
  minutes, or until tender-crisp, and cool. Arrange the cooked
  vegetables, cucumber, sprouts and tofu on a serving platter.
  
  In a small saucepan, mix the peanut butter, water, lemon juice,
  Tabasco sauce, salt, garlic and lemon peel; stir over low heat until
  smooth. Remove from the heat and discard the garlic and lemon zest.
  Stir in the yogurt. Serve the dressing warm over the salad.
  
  Lagniappe - One-quarter teaspoon of Tabasco sauce perks up any salad
  dressing.  Use more for a spicier taste.

      Title: SUMMER ASPARAGUS SOUP
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter
      1    Onion, chopped
  1 1/2 lb Asparagus, fresh
      2 tb Flour
      6 c  Water, boiling
      2 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Chicken broth, rich
           -(optional)
      2    Egg yolks
    1/2 c  Milk
 
  Melt the butter in a pan big enough to cook the soup. Saute the
  onions for a few minutes, until transparent but not brown.
  
  Meanwhile, slice the asparagus into thin slices.  Now add the sliced
  asparagus pieces to the onions and continue to saute (over medium to
  medium-high heat) for 15 minutes, until most of the moisture has
  steamed out of the asparagus and the mixture has just barely started
  to brown.
  
  Add the flour to the onion/asparagus mixture and stir well to coat
  each piece with some flour. Cook for 2 or 3 more minutes over
  medium-high heat. Dump the boiling water into the asparagus mixture.
  Add the (optional) chicken broth and the salt. Simmer for 1 hour.
  
  Strain out the cooked asparagus, leaving behind a thin yellow-green
  soup. Thicken the soup with the 2 egg yolks. Add the milk and reheat
  the soup to serving temperature. Add salt and fresh-ground white
  pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A light and simple asparagus soup -- Every summer, it seems, the
  grocery stores are glutted with cheap asparagus. Most of the
  classical recipes for asparagus soup produce a hearty winter-style
  soup. Here's a simple recipe for a delicious, light, thin soup that
  is more in keeping with the time of the year that the glut occurs.
  You can leave out the chicken broth to make it a meatless soup, but
  it does require egg yolks. Yield: Serves 4-6.
  
  *  The slicing disk on a food processor does an excellent job of
  slicing the asparagus for this recipe. You can use a food mill, a
  china cap, or an ordinary sieve to strain the cooked asparagus out of
  the broth.
  
  *  Don't try to make this soup as a low-salt soup by leaving out the
  salt.
   It will taste like dishwater if you cook the asparagus for an hour
  without salt. Don't try to skimp on time by leaving the cooked
  asparagus in the broth unstrained. It will ruin the texture.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate (thickening soup with egg yolks is
  not a beginner's skill).
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour simmering, 5 minutes
  finishing. : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK.

  1 1/2 c  Unbleached white flour
      2 tb Sugar
    1/2 c  Butter; chilled
           -- cut into small pieces
      1    Egg yolk

    1/3 c  Sugar
      1 tb Cornstarch; dissolved in:
      2 ts -Water

MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
    1/2 pt Heavy cream; whipped
 
  FOR THE PATE BRISEE, stir the flour and sugar together in a mixing
  bowl. Cut the chilled butter into small pieces and drop into the
  flour. With your fingers, lightly and quickly rub the butter and
  flour together until the mixture becomes crumbly, or cut it in with a
  knife or pastry cutter. Whisk together the egg yolk, lemon juice, and
  1 tablespoon of water. Sprinkle the liquid over the butter-flour
  mixture and continue to stir or rub this mixture between your fingers
  until a ball of dough forms. Be careful not to overwork the dough. If
  the mixture is crumbly, add up to one more tablespoon water,
  sprinkling it over the dough and lightly kneading it into a ball. On
  a floured board and with a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough
  into a large circle. Gently lift it into a 9- or 10-inch pie plate or
  tart tin. Patch any holes in the crust with bits of dough and trim
  the edges. Flute the crust. Chill for 2 hours. Preheat the oven to
  375 F. Place a sheet of aluminum foil in the bottom of the crust and
  fill it with dried beans or rice to weigh it down during baking. Bake
  for 15 minutes. Remove the crust from the oven and carefully lift out
  the foil and beans. Bake for 5 minutes more. Cool. TO MAKE THE
  FILLING, heat in a small saucepan 2 cups of the blueberries, 2
  tablespoons of water, and the sugar. Crush a few berries with a spoon
  to release the juice. When the berries have softened and become
  juicy, add the cornstarch mixture. Simmer on low heat for about 10
  minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens. Remove it
  from the heat and fold in one more cup of blueberries. Pour the berry
  mixture into the baked pie shell. Top with remaining 2 cups
  blueberries. Cool for at least one hour. Serve plain or topped with

      Title: SUMMER FRUIT BREAD ABM
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 24 Oz
 
MMMMM----------------BEST BREADMACHINE COOKBK EVE---------------------
    1/2 c  Blueberries, frozen
  2 1/4 ts Yeast
  2 1/4 c  Bread flour
      1 c  Whole wheat flour
    1/4 c  Sugar
      3 tb Dry milk
    1/2 ts Cloves, ground
    1/4 ts Cinnamon, ground
      1 ts Salt
      1 c  Peaches, chopped
  1 1/2 tb Butter
      1    Eggs
    2/3 c  Water
 
  Blackberries may be substituted for the blueberries. Nectarines may be
  substituted for the peaches.  If berries are fresh, freeze them
  anyway so they will not get too mushy in the bread dough. In some
  machines they will stay partially solid; in others, berries will
  marbleize the dough.
  
  Bring all ingredients except berries to room temperature and pour into
  bakery, in order.  Set "baking control" at 10 o'clock. Select "white
  bread" and push Start.  Add berries at beep.
  
  This sweet, moist bread can go to the beach and is also great on a
  sailboat, a cruise, or a race, because it keeps well and does not
  make too many crumbs. Bread makes good boat food because you can eat
  it with one hand and still have a hand free to take the tiller.
  
  In hot & humid weather, use 1/8 c less water.

      Title: SUMMER FRUIT~ HONEY~ & HAZELNUT CRUMBLE
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Mixed soft summer fruits--
           -raspberries, loganberries,
           -strawberries, currants,
           -bilberries or whatever is
           -available
           -honey or brown sugar to
           -taste
      3 oz Tasted hazelnuts
      3 oz Wholewheat breadcrumbs
 
  A baked dessert like this would have been sunk in the embers of the
  log fire with a cauldron or pot upturned over it to form a lid... Put
  the fruits in a pan or microwave dish with about 1 inch water in the
  bottom and cook gently for 10-15 minutes (4-6 minutes in microwave),
  or till the fruits are soft without being totally mushy. Sweeten to
  taste with honey or brown sugar (Saxons would have used honey); how
  much you need will depend on what fruits you have used. drain the
  excess juice and save to serve with the pudding. chop the hazelnuts
  in a processor or liquidiser until they are almost as fine as the
  breadcrumbs, but not quite, then mix the two together. Spoon the
  fruit into an ovenproof dish and cover with a thick layer of
  hazelnuts and crumbs. Bake in a moderate oven (180C) for 20 to 30
  minutes or till the top is slightly cruncy and browned. Serve with
  lots of cream or plain yogurt and the warmed fruit juices.

      Title: SUMMER FUDGE
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 1 Pound
 
      1 pk Jello (3 oz.)
  2 1/4 c  Granulated white sugar
           Baking soda*
      1 c  Milk OR yogurt OR sour cream
           -OR buttermilk
      1 tb Butter (ice-cold) OR 1/2 to
           -1 teaspoon flavoring

MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
      3 dr Food coloring
      1 pk Kool-Aid Unsweetened Drink
           -Mix (2-qt size) plus 1/2
           -ts additional baking soda
    1/2 c  Chopped nuts
    1/2 c  Mini-marshmallows
 
  * use 1/4 teaspoon for noncitrus flavors such as raspberry,
  strawberry-banana, or apricot. Use 1/2 teaspoon for lemon, lime,
  orange, and other citrus flavors. Add 1/2 teaspoon more when using
  yogurt, sour cream, or buttermilk.
  
  Gelatin-dairy product combinations: with citrus flavors, use milk to
  keep acid down; with noncitrus flavors, use milk (sets fastest) or
  yogurt (low, low fat) or sour cream (richer but treacherous). If you
  combine citrus flavors and yogurt or sour cream, be sure to add
  additional baking soda as specified in the basic recipe.
  
  1. Prewarm thermometer by placing in saucepan of cold water and then
  bringing to a boil. Grease, and if necessary, line a 5 x 10-inch pan.
  Freeze 1 tablespoon butter. Fill a glass with ice cubes and water.
  Fill sink half-inch full of HOT water (so gelatin does not set up
  prematurely).
  
  2. In a 3-quart (unbuttered) saucepan (use a 6-qt pan if using citrus
  gelatin or yogurt, sour cream, or buttermilk), combine all ingredients
  EXCEPT butter, flavoring, and optional ingredients. Dissolve sugar,
  stirring constantly with wooden spoon over low heat until sugar is
  dissolved. Gritty sounds will cease, spoon will glide smoothly over
  bottom of pan. However, since you will see granules on the spoon,
  test by drawing finger -- watch out, it may be very hot -- through
  the spoon and feel to make sure it is not sugary. Increase heat to
  medium and bring to a boil.
  
  3. Boil after washing down any crystals that may have formed with
  pastry brush dipped in hot water from thermometer bath, using as
  little water as possible. Introduce prewarmed thermometer. Reduce
  heat while retaining boil. Stir almost constantly, especially around
  sides. Depending on the dairy product/gelatin combination you use,
  mixture may start to cook down and change color slightly.
  
  4. Test in ice-cold water when mixture thickens and bubbles become
  noisy. Ball, formed in ice water, should hold its shape until heat
  from your hand begins to flatten it and should be al dente - slightly
  chewy. Temperatures are very approximate; on the average, 236-238
  degrees F.
  
  5. Shock by placing saucepan in sink of hot water.
  
  6. Seed by adding, without stirring, frozen butter or flavoring, as
  well as any food coloring and Kool-Aid. Then allow to cool.
  
  7. Stir when lukewarm and "skin" forms on top (110 degrees F). Return
  thermometer to its hot-water bath to soak clean. Stir fudge
  thoroughly but not vigorously by hand (gelatin may stick to bottom of
  pan so use scraping motion to free it), with electric mixer, or in
  food processor. Pause frequently to allow fudge to react.
  
  8. Watch for fudge to thicken, lose its sheen, become lighter in
  color or streaked with lighter shades, give off some heat, suddenly
  stiffen. If mixing by hand, fudge will "snap" with each stroke; by
  mixer, mixer waves will become very distinct; by food processor,
  fudge will flow sluggishly back to center when processor is stopped.
  
  9. Add any optional ingredients before fudge totally candies.
  
  10. Pour into pan, score, and store when cool in airtight container in
  refrigerator or at room temperature.
  
  Yield: 1 pound. Recipe can be doubled if you have a large stockpot
  and if you process in your mixer. There's too much to process in one
  batch in food processor, and it's too hard on your arm to do by hand.

 Categories: None
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Nectarines, pitted, cut
           -into eighths
      1 pt Fresh blueberries
    1/2 c  Packed light brown sugar
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
           Grated rind (colored part
           -only) from  1/2 lemon
  1 1/2 ts Fresh lemon juice
      1 tb Cold unsalted butter, cut
           -into slivers

MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
      2 c  All-purpose flour
      3 tb Granulated sugar
      1 tb Baking powder
      5 tb Cold unsalted butter, cut
           -into bits
    3/4 c  Plus 1 tb whipping cream
      1 ts Sugar
 
  Usually made with a rolled sweet crust baked on top of fruit, the
  crust is "dowdied" by pushing the crust into the fruit to soften
  before serving or by inverting the crust during serving to the bottom
  of the serving bowl. Serve this warm from the oven or at room
  temperature, with or without ice cream. 1. Position a rack in the
  center of the oven and heat the oven to 425 degrees. Butter a
  deep-dish pie pan or an 8-inch-square baking dish; set aside. 2.
  Gently stir together the fruit, brown sugar, cinnamon, lemon rind and
  juice in a large bowl. Pour the fruit into the prepared pan. Scatter
  the 1 tablespoon butter slivers over the fruit. 3. For the crust, put
  flour, 3 tablespoons sugar and the baking powder in a large mixing
  bowl. Whisk to combine. Work the bits of butter into the flour
  mixture with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse
  meal. Add 3/4 cup of the cream and stir with a fork. The mixture will
  be stringy. Knead with your hand about 45 seconds and it will become
  smooth. 4. Roll the dough to 1/4-inch thickness. Trim it to about 1/2
  inch larger than the baking dish. Cut a small circle out of the
  center of the crust to serve as a steam vent, and carefully place the
  crust over the fruit. Do not press the crust against the sides of the
  pan. Reroll the scraps and cut as decorations if you desire. Brush
  the crust with the remaining 1 tablespoon of cream and sprinkle with
  the teaspoon of sugar. 5. Place the pandowdy on a baking sheet with
  raised sides and bake 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350
  degrees and loosely cover the crust with a foil tent, shiny side out.
  Continue baking until the crust is golden and the fruit bubbly, 35 to
  45 minutes. Either "dowdy" the crust now by pushing it under the
  surface of the fruit or serve crust side down in bowls.

    1/4 c  Olive oil
      1 lg Dead-ripe tomatoe
      1    Sprig of basil
           Clove of garlic
    3/4 ts Salt
           Shredded parmesan
 
   Place a pan containing 1/4 cup best olive oil per diner over medium
  heat. Coarsely chop about 2 small or 1 large, dead-ripe tomatoes per
  diner. (I don't peel them, but you could, if you prefer.) Mince a
  sprig of basil for each diner, and one small clove of garlic for the
  whole. Place the tomatoes, basil, and garlic in a pyrex dish (I use a
  2-quart measure) and add 3/4 teaspoon of salt.  Stir gently until the
  tomatoes begin to give up their juice.  Just before the olive oil is
  hot enough to smoke, pour it over the tomato mixture and stir to
  blend.
   Serve on room temperature cooked pasta of your choice (my current
  favorite is cappellini) with shredded parmesan on the side.

  barely simmering and add the remaining ingredients. Turn off the heat
  and allow the mixture to cool.
  
  Mix the flavouring solution and all the remaining ingredients into the
  meat.
  
  Cure the sausage in the refrigerator for twenty-four hours. Stuff the
  meat into the casings and tie off into six-inch or eight-inch links.
  
  Smoke the sausage with a cool (80-90 F) smoke for about twelve hours.
  
  Increase the smoke temperature to about 120 F and continue to smoke
  for abut four or five more hours, or until the sausage is firm.
  
  Let the sausage hang in a cool place at least two weeks before eating.
  
  * Pork to be consumed raw, as in dried sausage, can be made
  completely safe and free of trichinae by freezing it to -20 F for six
  to twelve days. -10 F for ten to twenty days or 5 F for twenty to
  thirty days. These guidelines have been set by the USDA for
  commercial packers and are perfectly safe if followed by the home
  sausage maker.
  
  If you can't or don't wish to tie up freezer space to treat your own
  sausage meat, you can ask your butcher to order you some "certified"
  pork. Certified pork has been frozen to render it trichinosis free
  and comes stamped or labeled as such.  Make sure you see the stamp or
  label.

      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Plum Tomatoes -- Quartered
    1/4 c  Extra Virgin Olive Oil
    1/3 c  Carrot -- Minced
    1/3 c  Celery -- Minced
    1/3 c  Yellow Onion -- Minced
      1 lg Garlic Clove -- Minced
    1/2 tb Fresh Oregano -- Minced

    1/2 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Red Pepper Flakes --
           Optional
    1/8 ts Sugar -- Optional
 
  To make sauce, put quartered tomatoes in a heavy, medium saucepan.
  Cover and simmer over moderate heat until tomatoes have collapsed and
  rendered their juices, about 15 minutes, uncovering and stirring once
  or twice to make sure they are not sticking to the pan bottom.
  Uncover, adjust heat to maintain a slow simmer and cook, stirring
  occasionally, until tomatoes have reduced to a thick, sauce like
  consistency, about 45 minutes. Pass the tomatoes through a food mill
  placed over a bowl to remove skins and seeds. You should have about 2
  cups puree.
  
  Heat olive oil in a 10-inch skillet over moderately low heat. Add
  carrot, celery, onion, garlic, oregano and parsley. Cook, stirring
  occasionally, until vegetables are soft and sweet, about 30 minutes.
  Add tomato puree. Stir to blend. Season with salt and, if desired,
  hot red pepper flakes and sugar if the tomatoes seem too tart. Cover
  and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes to blend flavors. Taste and
  adjust seasoning. You should have about 2 cups sauce.

  peppercorns, garlic, fennel seeds and sugar and bring to a boil. Cook
  2 minutes and add fennel. Cook fennel until just tender, about 4
  minutes, and remove with spider to a cool plate. Add zucchini and
  cook until just tender, about 1 minute, and remove to a separate
  plate. Add cauliflower and cook until tender, about 3 minutes, and
  remove to a cool plate. Add red onions and cook until tender, about 2
  minutes, and remove to a cool plate.
  
  Return cooking liquid to a boil and boil for 3 minutes. Remove from
  heat and add oil and vinegar.
  
  Divide vegetables among 3 jars (1 or 2 quart jars work best, but any
  size will do) and cover them with the cooking liquid. If there is not
  enough liquid, add a little white wine vinegar to cover. Allow jars
  to cool, cover with lids and refrigerate. Pickles will keep up to a
  month in the refrigerator.

      Title: SUN DRIED TOMATO DIP
 Categories: Dips, Microwave
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Dry
           (Not In Oil)
      2 c  Water
     10 md Cloves Garlic, Peeled
  1 1/2 ts Oregano, Dried
  1 1/2 ts Thyme, Dried
  1 1/4 c  Olive Oil
    1/4 c  Vegetable Oil
 
  MICROWAVE OVEN METHOD: Combine tomatoes, water, garlic, oregano and
  thyme in a 13x9x2-inch oval glass or ceramic dish. Cover tightly with
  microwave plastic wrap. Cook at 100% in a high-wattage oven for 8
  minutes. Prick plastic to release steam. Remove from oven and
  uncover. Stir well. Re-cover and cook for 8 minutes longer. Prick
  plastic to release steam. Remove from oven and uncover.  Stir well
  and allow to stand, stirring occasionally, until cool and most of the
  liquid has been absorbed. Transfer to a 1-1/2-quart souffle dish.
  Pour 3/4 cup of the olive oil and the vegetable oil over the tomato
  mixture. Cover tightly with microwave plastic wrap and cook for 5
  minutes. Prick plastic to release steam. Remove from oven and
  uncover.  Stir and allow to stand until cool. Transfer to the work
  bowl of a food processor and puree until smooth. Scrape into a large
  bowl and stir in remaining olive oil if serving immediately.
  Otherwise, pack in a refrigerator storage container with a tightly
  fitting lid. The dip will keep as long as a month, so think about
  making the whole quantity. STOVE-TOP METHOD: Cover sun-dried tomatoes
  with water in nonreactive saucepan. Bring to a boil over med heat,
  about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, covered, for 22
  minutes. Allow to cool. Drain. Cook with oil, garlic, oregano and
  thyme over low heat, covered, for 20 minutes. Puree. Above makes 3
  cups. Author's note: The sun-dried tomato dip is a real breakthrough.
  At a recent cocktail party, 7 guests demanded the recipe. Buying
  sun-dried tomatoes dry in bulk instead of packed in oil makes them
  less expensive. Reviving them in the microwave means that you can use
  a minimum of liquid for optimum intensity of flavor. Then they be
  packed up in good quality olive oil (much better than that which
  comes with them in jars) to use as needed or to turn into this dip,
  with its rich, mystifying flavor.  The dip keeps for weeks in the
  refrigerator. You will want to have the ubiquitous sliced raw
  vegetables; fennel does well with this dip. You don't have to use a
  microwave oven; you can still make this dip even if it is slightly
  less intense in flavor. The reward is the cooking water. Save it to
  use for boiling pasta. Cooked either way, this dip makes a delicious
  pasta sauce. Below are timings for other amounts of sun-dried
  tomatoes so that you can multiply and divide the recipe as you want.
  Almost every informal party requires at least one dip. Allow 1/4 cup
  per guest.  At bigger parties, I often supply two or three, spacing
  them around the room(s) with dippers at each location. MICROWAVE OVEN
  METHOD: FOR 1/4 POUND DRIED TOMATOES: With 1 cup water in a 2-1/2
  quart souffle dish, cook, covered, at 100% in a high-wattage oven 5
  minutes; prick plastic to release steam; stir; cook, uncovered, 5
  minutes. In a low-wattage oven, cook 9 minutes and 9 minutes. FOR 1/2
  POUND DRIED TOMATOES: With 2 cups water in a 13x9x2-inch oval glass
  or ceramic dish, cook in a high-wattage oven 8 minutes, then 8

 Categories: Thai, Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Mackerel
      3 tb Salt
    1/2 c  Water
 
  One day of bright sunlight is an essential part of this recipe. This
  method of food preservation is particularly suitable for fish of all
  types, although mackerel is a favorite.
  ~------------------------------------------------------
  ~----------------- Remove only the entrails and rinse the fish until
  clean. Dissolve the salt in the water and soak the fish overnight in
  the salt solution. The next day, hang the fish in bright sunlight and
  allow to dry for at least one whole day.  Alternatively, bake the
  fish at 325øF for 45 minutes.
  
  Seafood dried by this method keeps indefinitely, and can be used in
  other recipes, such as fried sun-dried fish (Pla Kem Taud).

      Yield: 1 Recipes
 
MMMMM-------------------------BILLS20086------------------------------
           Large ripe tomatoes
           Red or green bell peppers
           Peeled whole garlic cloves
           Fruity extra-virgin olive
           Oil
           Basil leaves
 
  This vibrantly colored and flavored combination can be made in any
  quantity.  It's great to have on hand for adding to sandwiches,
  homemade pizzas, salads, frittatas, and omelets, or for serving as a
  condiment with thinly sliced flank steak or grilled tuna, bluefish,
  or swordfish. It also makes a beautiful gift. Tomatoes can be
  "sun-dried" by placing them on a rack-lined pan under the hot sun for
  about 2 days, but the oven-drying method below is a lot easier. 1.
  Wash and dry the tomatoes and cut them into eighths lengthwise. Using
  a small spoon, scoop out the seeds and juice. Place a wire rack on a
  baking sheet and arrange the tomatoes on the rack, skin side up.
  Allow the tomatoes to drain excess juice for about 1 hour. 2. Set the
  oven on the warm setting (the temperature should be about 150~).
  Transfer the rack to a clean baking sheet and place inthe oven. Dry
  the tomatoes, turning them every few hours with a spatula, until they
  are leathery, a about 12 hours. Remove them from the oven and allow
  them to cool on the rack. 3. To roast the peppers, first preheat the
  boiler and then cut the peppers into halves lengthwise and see them.
  Place the peppers skin side up on a baking sheet and broil them,
  placing them as close as possible to the heat, until the skin chars.
  4. Immediately transfer the peppers to a brown paper bag and close
  the bag, trapping the steam. When the peppers are cool, about 5
  minutes, rub off the skins and cut the peppers into 1/2-inch wide
  strips. 5. Have ready sterilized pint jars and the garlic and basil.
  Arrange a single layer of tomato strips in the bottom of each jar,
  followed by a layer of pepper strips. Add a garlic clove and a few
  basil leaves, keeping the garlic and basil against the side of the
  jar so they show.  Continue layering until all the jars are almost
  filled but not tightly packed. 6. Carefully pour oil into the jars
  until about half filled.  Tilt the jars and tap them so the oil seeps
  down, filling any air bubbles and covering the vegetables completely.
  Add more oil, covering the vegetables and leaving a 1/8-inch space at
  the top of the jars, and seal. Store in a cool, dark place for at
  least a week before using and no longer than 3 months.

  *DIRECTIONS*
  
  BLANCHING TECHNIQUE: Bring 1-quart of water to boil. Submerge

  and cut into strips.
  
  In a food processor, combine cream cheese, butter, Parmesan, olive
  oil and remaining sun-dried tomatoes. Process until smooth. Place in

  Makes 2-1/2 cups.
  
  Recipe from Melissa's brand Sun-dried Tomatoes.
  
  This recipe was called "Dried Tomato Dip" but I sure didn't see it as
  a dip so I renamed it.  I guess it could be a spread, but sure can't
  see "dipping" anything into this as it would be too stiff.

      3 tb Instant tapioca
      1 c  Pineapple juice

  1 1/2 tb Lemon juice
    1/2 c  Mandarin orange sections
           -- (canned), drained

      Title: SUNCHOKE MOUSSE
 Categories: Vegetables, Healthy
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  1 3/4 lb Sunchokes
           -(jerusalem artichokes)
    2/3 c  Fromage blanc OR
    2/3 c  Cottage cheese, lowfat
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Freshly ground black pepper
 
  "Maniere serve a steamed sirloin steak with a mousse made from pureed
  steamed sunchokes, low in fat because it's enriched with low-fat
  cheese instead of cream. Steamed sunchokes make a magnificent buttery,
  ivory-colored puree, silky smooth, nutty, and pleasantly sweet, like a
  delicious winter squash. This low-fat recipe is superb, but if you
  like, you can replace the cheese with a quarter cup of creme fraiche
  (or the same amount of heavy cream mixed with half a teaspoon of
  fresh lemon juice) and two to three tablespoons of butter. Serve this
  mousse with fish and poultry dishes as well. Maniere made the mousse
  up to an hour before the steak and then reheated it, in its serving
  bowl, in a second steaming compartment, while the steak steamed. If
  you don't have a steamer with two compartments, reheat the mousse in
  another steamer or in a saucepan over low heat."
  
  Put the sunchokes on the steamer rack, place over simmering water,
  cover, and steam until tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from the
  steamer, let cool slightly, and then peel with a pairing knife. Put
  the sunchokes into the bowl of a food processor, add the fromage
  blanc or cottage cheese, salt, and pepper and puree until smooth.
  Transfer to a bowl to keep warm in the steamer, or transfer to a
  saucepan and set aside.

      Title: SUNDAY CHICKEN REVISITED
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      3    Whole chicken breasts, skin
           -left on (weight after
           -boning, 2 1/2 to 2 3/4 lb)
      3 tb Butter, cut into 6 pieces
           -and slightly softened
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Chicken broth
    3/4 ts Cornstarch, mixed with
      1 tb Water
 
  NOTE: Because most boneless chicken breasts these days come without
  skin, ask your butcher to so it specially, or buy bone-in breasts and
  bone them yourself.
  
  Preheat the oven to 425'F. Rub the chicken breasts on all sides with
  butter; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Fold each breast in half, skin
  side out, stretching the skin as much as possible to cover the meat.
  Hold the "bundle" together by running through with wooden or metal
  skewers.
  
  Bake on the rack of a roasting pan for 25-30 minutes, or until an oven
  thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the chicken registers
  155-160'F. Remove to a cutting board. Loosely cover with aluminum
  foil to keep warm.
  
  Meanwhile, add the broth to the roasting pan. Scrape the pan with a
  wooden spatula to dissolve the meat juices. Pour this liquid into a
  fat separator (or a regular measuring cup) and wait a bit for the fat
  to rise to the top. Pour off (or spoon off) the fat. Pour the
  defatted liquid into a small pan and bring to a rapid boil. Boil down
  to 3/4 cup of liquid. Stir in the dissolved cornstarch, and cook
  until the gravy thickens slightly.
  
  Discard the chicken skin, if you like. Cut each breast diagonally into
  about eight long, thin slices. Arrange on a platter and pass the gravy
  separately.

      Title: SUNDAY LOAF
 Categories: Breads, Breakfast
      Yield: 18 Servings
 
      3 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Sugar
      4 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Salt
      8 tb Butter, chilled
      2    Eggs
    1/2 c  Raspberry jam/preserves or
    1/2 c  Strawberry jam/preserves
    3/4 c  Milk
      2 tb Butter
      2 tb Sugar
      2 tb Raspberry jam or
      2 tb Strawberry jam
 
  Servings: 18
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. Combine the
  flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Stir
  with a fork to mix all dry ingredients well. Cut the butter into
  small pieces and drop into the flour mixture. Using your fingers or a
  pastry cutter, rub or cut the cold butter into the flour until
  mixture resembles coarse bread crumbs. Beat the eggs well in a small
  bowl, add the jam or preserves and milk; whisk until the mixture is
  blended smooth. Stir the egg mixture into the flour mixture and stir
  only until no flour streaks show--the mixture wil be lumpy. Spoon
  into the loaf pan and bake for about 1 hour 15 minutes, or until a
  straw inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow loaf to remain
  in the pan for 15 to 20 minutes before turning it out onto a rack.
  Meanwhile, make the glaze by combining the butter, sugar, and jam in
  a pan. Stir and bring to a simmer; continue stirring until dissolved
  and blended. Strain and then spoon the glaze over the loaf after it
  has cooled on the rack.

      Title: SUNDAY MORNING TOFU SCRAMBLE
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      8    To 12 ounces firm low fat
           Tofu
      1 md Cold baked potato, cubed,
           Not peeled
      1 sm Onion or several scallions,
           Chopped
        x  Several mushrooms, sliced
      1 sm Zuchinni
    1/2 c  Salsa
 
  brown the cubed potato in a dry non-stick skillet add onions,
  mushrooms and zuchinni cook until veggies are done. Crumble tofu with
  a fork, add to the skillet and heat thoroughly Season with salsa, add
  peppers if you like it spicey, I like the pickled jalapeno slices.
  
  Serve as is or wrap in a tortilla for a breakfast burrito.
  
  I actually usually double this recipe, the leftovers reheat nicely. Of
  course, you can change the seasonings as you like. How about using
  peas instead of zuchinni and season with curry? Sometimes I add
  veggie saugase or seasoned seitan.  Use your imagination.

  Ann's notes:  This is a delicious, though unusual color (burnt orange)
  appetizer.  I used the not-oil-packed tomatoes and soaked them in hot
  water first.  I then added 1 T. olive oil instead of the 1 T. reserved
  tomato-oil.  I also cut these into 28 pieces and they were just right
  for pick-up appetizers. I found the baking time specified to be too
  short. Next time, I would increase the temperature to 375 for the
  filled cake to get it done in 20-25 minutes.

      2 c  Whole wheat flour
      1 c  Sunflower seeds or raisins
    1/3 c  Honey
  2 1/4 c  Warm water (105 to 115 deg)
      2 ea Pkgs active dry yeast
    1/3 c  Margarine
    1/3 c  Nonfat dry milk
      1 tb Salt
 
  Combine in a 2 gallon heavy duty freezer bag: 1 cup water, 2 pkgs
  yeast, 1/3 cup honey and 1 cup all-purpose flour.
  
  Squeeze upper part of bag to force air out. Close top of bag tightly.
  Rest bag on table. Mix by working bag with fingers about 20 seconds

  Add all remaining ingredients but for the flour and sunflower seeds or
  raisins.
  
  Mix by working bag with fingers. Gradually add 2 cups whole wheat
  flour and 1 cup sunflower seeds or raisins, whichever you prefer.
  Gradually add remaining all-purpose flour until a stiff dough is
  formed, or until dough pulls away from the bag. (Reserve about 1/2
  cup flour to use during the kneading process.) Turn dough out on
  lightly floured board, divided in thirds. (may also divide in 1/2 and
  bake in 2 bans, 9x5x3 inches.)
  
  Knead each part well, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more
  flour `ONLY' to keep dough from sticking. Cover with plastic mixing
  bag. Let rise 30 minutes or until double in bulk. Work dough and form
  each into a loaf and place in a 8-1/2x4-1/2x2-1/4 inch loaf pan
  (makes 3 loaves in this size pan.
  
  Cover loosely with plastic bag and let rise in warm place 45 to 60
  minutes or until doubled. Uncover. Bake on lower rack in 400 degree
  oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until golden brown. (May want to cover
  loosly with foil the last 10 or 15 minutes to prevent crust from
  becoming too brown.) Brush tops with melted butter; remove from pans
  and cool on racks.

      Title: SUNFLOWER PEANUT BUTTER
 Categories: Spreads
      Yield: 1 Cup
 
      1 c  Sunflower seeds; *
    3/4 c  Peanuts; *
           ;salt to taste
           Vegetable oil; as needed
 
  * OR 1 1/4 cups sunflower seed meal OR 1/2 cup sunflower seed butter,
  raw or roasted
  
  ** OR 1 cup peanut meal OR 1/2 cup peanut butter, raw or roasted
  
  This recipe could be very complicated for a simple nut butter. What is
  important is the proportion of sunflower seeds to peanuts. If you
  substitute butter for nuts, or meal for sunflower seeds, just be sure
  the proportions are correct. You may also use either raw or roasted
  nuts, seeds, meals, or butters in any combination.
  
  1. For whole seeds and nuts, grind them together in your blender,
  adding 1/4 to 1/2 cup oil to start them into butter. Add salt to
  taste.
  
  2. For meals: stir the meals (and salt) together. Add oil to turn
  them into butter.
  
  3. For butters: simply combine the two butters, adding salt if
  desired.
  
  Combinations: A delicious and crunchy butter could be made by
  reserving about 1/3 to 1/2 cup of whole sunflower seeds. Add these
  whole seeds (raw or roasted) to the finished butter.

 Categories: Desserts, Thai
      Yield: 1 Serving
 
      1 c  Coconut Milk
    3/4 c  Palm Sugar
    1/2 c  Sugar
      4 ea Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla Extract (Optional)
 
  Put coconut milk in a medium size bowl.  Add all ingredients and whisk
  lightly until all ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Note:
  Traditionally, the mixing is done by hand mixing everything together
  and crushing in pieces of banana leave, or the leave of an aromatic
  plant (bai-tey). The leaves are then picked out and discarded. Here,
  vanilla extract is used in place of the aromatic "bai-tey". The aroma
  is not the same, but they both will serve to hide the "raw" taste of
  the eggs. Divide the mixture into suitable containers and steam for
  approximately 30 to 45 minutes. Suitable container may be simply
  glass bowls, or hollowed out small pumpkins, or young "green" coconut
  with the top of the shell removed.

      Title: SUNOMONO OR JAPANESE NOODLE & CUCUMBER SALA
 Categories: Digest, Oriental
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      5    To 6 oz. of dry vermicelli
           Noodles
      6 tb Rice vinegar
      4 ts Sugar
      2 ts Soy sauce
      1 ts Salt
      1    To 2 tbsp of sesame seeds
      1    Medium-sized cucumber
           - extra sesame seeds for the
           Top
           - scallion greens, thinly
           Sliced-optional (I used the
           Scallions greens)
 
  1) Cook the noodles in boiling water until just tender. Drain and
  rinse in cold water. Drain thoroughly, and transfer to a medium-sized
  bowl. (My advice, store in water if not using right away!) 2) Add
  vinegar, sugar, soy sauce, salt, and sesame seeds. Mix well. Cover
  and chill until cold. (Don't chill for too long or the noodles will
  stick together. I did this but was able to save it by adding more
  rice vinegar until the noodles separated again. It tasted great.) 3)
  Peel adn seed the cucumber. Cut into quarters lengthwise, then into
  thin pieces. If not serving right away, wrap the cucumber pieces in a
  plastic bag or plastic wrap and refrigerate. 4) To serve, divide the
  noodles amon 4 or 5 serving bowls. Top with a small handful of
  cucumber slices, a light sprinkling of sesame seeds, and , if
  desired, a few very thin slices of scallion greens. Serve cold.
  
  This salad is subtle adn very refreshing. There is a variety of
  textures-chewy cold noodles (bean thread noodles, some call them
  cellophane noodles 'cause when you boil them they become clear),
  crunchy sesame seeds, and smooth cucumber slices. Sweet, salt, and
  vinegar combine harmoniously, each understated but very much present.
  
  Everything except the cucumbers and toppings can be combined several
  days ahead of time. (I beg to differ on this claim because, if you
  don't keep the boiled noodles in cold water while setting them aside,
  they will stick together.) The cucumbers can be prepared ahead also,
  and kept separate until serving.
  
  Note: The dressing contains no oil. ( However the sesame seeds do)
  
  Prep time:  15 minutes, plus chilling time, Yield: 4 to 5 servings
  
  Bon Appetit!

  One of the few low-fat coffee cakes we've found. The texture seems to
  be best when baked in a tube pan. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cream
  margarine, egg whites, lemon rind, juice and brown sugar until
  smooth. Sift together dry ingredients and add alternatly with yogurt
  to egg white mixture. Fold in fruit, and spread into a tube pan which
  has been sprayed with nonstick spray. Combine all topping
  ingredients(it works well to use the same bowl and incorporate the
  scrapings from the batter)and sprinkle over coffee cake. Bake for
  about 35 minutes until wooden pick inserted in the center comes out
  clean. Serve topped with yogurt, if desired. Makes 16 servings.

  their shape but are still soft and moist. Use rubber spatula to
  gently fold sugar, in 3 batches, into whites. Then fold in lemon
  extract, rind and reserved egg yolks until blended. Gently fold in
  flour. Transfer batter to pan; spread evenly with spatula. Bake until
  lightly browned and toothpick inserted into center comes out clean,
  about 45 minutes. Invert pan to let cake cool. When completely cool,
  use flexible knife to release cake from sides, then bottom, of pan.
  Can be kept well-covered at room temperature for a day or frozen up
  to 3 months. To serve, spread top and sides with lemony frosting.
  
  LEMONY FROSTING: Place all ingredients except milk or water in mixing
  bowl. Combine with wooden spoon until smooth. Add milk or water as
  necessary, for desired consistency. Spread on cake. Yield: frosting
  for one 10-inch tube cake.

      Title: SUOMALAISRUISLEIPA (FINNISH RYE BREAD)
 Categories: Breads, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Beer, buttermilk, milk, or
           -potato water
      2 tb Butter or margerine
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Dry yeast
    1/2 c  Warm water
      1 tb Sugar
      2 c  Dark rye flour or light rye
           -flour or rye meal (rye
           -flour with bran)
  3 1/2    To 4 cups unbleached white
           -flour
 
  Will have a more or less sour taste, depending whether it is made with
  beer, buttermilk, potato water, or milk, in that order.
  
  Heat 1 1/2 cups liquid to lukewarm.  Stir in the butter and salt. Set
  aside to cool.
  
  Dissolve the yeast in the warm water (a temperature comfortable on the
  inside of the wrist) with the sugar. Let stand for 5 minutes or until
  the yeast bubbles.
  
  Stir the yeast mixture into the cooled liquid.  Add the rye flour and
  beat until smooth.  Add the white flour, a cup at a time, stirring
  after each addition until enough is added to make a stiff dough. Dust
  a work surface with white flour.  Form the dough into a rough ball,
  place it on the work surface, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it
  rest for 15 minutes. Generously butter a large bowl or pot.
  
  Adding only as much flour as necessary to prevent sticking, knead the
  bread dough until smooth, about 5 minutes. (The gluten in rye is more
  fragile than in wheat. It needs a resting time to recuperate and
  reform and does not need as lengthy or vigorous a kneading). Form the
  dough into a smooth ball and place it in a buttered bowl, turning it
  to coat all sides with the butter. Cover it and let it rise in a warm
  spot until doubled in size, about 2 hours.
  
  Punch the dough down, gently knead it for one minute, and divide it
  into two parts.  Form each half into a round loaf and place the
  loaves in two lightly buttered 9-inch round cake pans or on a large,
  buttered baking sheet.  Press a hole through the center of each loaf
  to give it a traditional shape if you wish. Cover and let rise until
  almost doubled in size, about 1/2 hour.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  BRush the loaves with water and
  gently puncture the surface all over with the tines of a fork, in a
  design if you wish.
  
  Bake for about 30 minutes or until the bread is golden brown and
  sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. While it is hot, brush it
  with butter to glaze, and then let it cool on a rack.
  
  Yields 2 round loaves.

 Categories: Vietnam, Soups/stews
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  2 1/2 qt Water
      2 lb Pork bones
      2 ts Salt
      1 tb Fish sauce (nuoc mam)
      1 ts Vegetable oil
      1    Clove garlic, chopped
      2    Shallots or
      2    Scallions, chopped white
           -part
    1/2 lb Crab meat, fresh, frozen,
           -or canned
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      2 ts Cornstarch dissolved in
      2 tb Water
      1    Egg
      1 cn (15 ounces) white

    1/4 c  Chopped fresh coriander
           -(Chinese parsley)
    1/4 c  Chopped scallion greens
 
  The French introduced asparagus to the Vietnamese, who promptly
  incorporated this classic vegetable into their cuisine. The
  Vietnamese word for asparagus is "Western bamboo," due to its
  resemblance to bamboo shoots. asparagus is universally popular
  throughout Vietnam, this light, tasty dish will delight your family
  as well.
  
  Bring water to a boil and put the pork bones in. Remove the scum, then
  cover and continue to boil the bones for 1 hour. Remove the bones
  from the stock and discard. Add the salt and the fish sauce to the
  stock.
  
  Heat the oil and add the chopped garlic and shallots; add the crab
  meat and fry for 5 minutes over high heat. Sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon
  of black pepper, stirring constantly, then add the crab meat mixture
  to the soup and bring to a boil.  Add the cornstarch-and-water
  mixture and stir for a few minutes.
  
  Break the egg open and drop it into the actively boiling soup while
  stirring.  Cook, still stirring, for about 2 minutes, then drop in the
  asparagus, along with the liquid from the can and the rest of the
  black pepper.  Continue to cook until the asparagus is heated through.
  
  Sprinkle the coriander and scallion green over the soup before
  serving.
  
  Makes 6 to 8 servings.

    3/4 c  Corn Syrup (light)
 
       Mix and shake.  Let settle at least 4 hours. Best to use within
  a day or two. If you need to store it longer, cover tightly and store
  in the fridge.  Use this mixture with those big bubble wands! I pour
  the mixture in a roasting pan and dip the wands in it. Don't swish
  the wands in the liquid too much because it will make the bubbles
  funny. This recipe

 Categories: Cookies, Chocolate, Godiva
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/8 ts Salt
      1 c  Unsalted butter -- softened
    3/4 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Packed light brown sugar
      2 lg Eggs -- room temperature
      2 ts Vanilla extract
      1 c  Mini semisweet chocolate --
           Chips
      1 c  Milk chocolate chips
      4 oz Bittersweet chocolate --
           Cut
           Inch chunks
      2 oz White chocolate -- coarsely
 
  1/2  cup           Coarsely chopped pecans 3/4 cup English toffee
  bits -- such Hershey's Skor
  
  Position one rack in the top and another in the bottom third of the
  oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.
  
  In a medium bowl, using a wire whisk, stir together the flour, baking
  soda and salt until thoroughly blended.
  
  In the 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using the
  paddle attachment, beat the butter for 30 seconds at medium speed,
  until creamy. Add the sugars and continue beating for 3 to 4 minutes,
  until the mixture is light in texture and color. Scrape down the
  sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the eggs one at a time,
  beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla.
  
  At low speed, beat in the flour mixture a third at a time, scraping
  down the sides of the bowl after each addition. Using a wooden spoon,
  stir in all the chocolate chips, the bittersweet chocolate and white
  chocolate. Stir in the pecans and toffee bits. The dough will be very
  stiff.
  
  Drop the dough by slightly rounded tablespoonfuls onto 2 ungreased
  baking sheets, leaving about 1 1/2 inches between the cookies.
  Refrigerate the remaining dough. Bake the cookies for 11 to 13
  minutes, or until the cookies are set and the edges are very lightly
  browned; switch the positions of the baking sheets halfway through
  the baking time for even browning.
  
  Cool the cookies on the baking sheets on wire racks for 1 to 2
  minutes. Using a metal spatula, transfer the cookies to wire racks to
  cool completely. Repeat with the remaining dough. The cookies can be
  stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days
  or frozen for up to 1 month.

      Title: SUPER DOUBLE-CREAM CHEESECAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Cheesecakes
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
      1    Box (8.5 oz.) chocolate
           Wafer cookies
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
           Pinch of salt
      6 tb Unsalted butter, melted

MMMMM--------------------------FILLING-------------------------------
      3    (8 oz.) packages cream
           Cheese, softened
    2/3 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Salt
      3    Eggs
      3 c  Sour cream
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2 tb Bourbon or dark rum
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      2 tb Unsalted butter, melted
 
  MAKE THE CRUST: In a food processor or blender, grind the cookies into
  moderately fine textured crumbs.  Add the sugar, cinnamon and salt and
  process briefly to blend. Transfer to a bowl, pour the butter over the
  crumbs and toss with a fork to moisten evenly.  Gently press the
  crumbs evenly over the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan.
  PREPARE THE CHEESECAKE FILLING: Preheat the oven to 350F. In a food
  processor, combine the cream cheese, sugar, salt and eggs; blend
  until smooth, scraping down the sides of the container as necessary.
  Add the sour cream (see note), lemon juice, bourbon, vanilla, butter,
  and blend. Pour the filling into the cookie crumb shell and bake in
  the middle of the oven for 45 minutes. Turn off the oven, prop the
  oven door slightly open and allow the cake to rest in the oven for 1
  hour. Cool on a rack and refrigerate for at least 8 hours. Note: If
  the container of the food processor is not large enough, add only 1
  cup of sour cream. Pour about half the mixture into a mixing bowl;
  add the reamining 2 cups of sour cream to the processor and blend.
  Combine both batches in the mixing bowl and stir to blend.
  
  "This is the epitome of cheesecakes - you won't find a creamier,
  tastier or better one anywhere.  Don't open the door during baking if
  you want to keep the top from cracking. Make this cake at least a day
  before you want to serve it to allow the flavors to develop."

      Title: SUPER DUPER FRENCH TOAST
 Categories: Breakfast, Breads, French
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6    Eggs, slightly beaten
    1/2 pt (1 cup) whipping cream
      1 c  Orange juice
      1    To 1 1/2 ounces Orange
           -Liqueur
      1    Loaf French Bread
           Butter, margarine or cooking
           -oil
           Powdered sugar
 
  *  Mix eggs, whipping cream and orange juice.  Then add liqueur to
  taste. Pour into large casserole or glass baking dish.
  
  Remove ends from the bread and cut loaf into 12-15 slices, each about
  3/4" thick.  Place slices in egg mixture and let stand for a few
  minutes to absorb some of the liquid; then turn so the other side of
  the bread can absorb some of the mixture. Cover tightly with plastic
  wrap and refrigerate until you are ready to prepare the French Toast.
  Some cooks soak the bread in the egg mixture overnight, refrigerated
  so that it becomes almost custardlike in texture.
  
  *
  
  Preheat heavy skillet or electric griddle to 325-350 degrees. Melt
  butter, margarine or place oil in skillet. Place four or five slices
  in to cook, but do not crowd. Cook on one side until golden brown,
  turn and cook on the other side.  Remove and keep warm while you cook
  remaining slices, adding more oil or butter as needed. Place toast on
  serving plates and dust with powered sugar.  Garnish with fresh
  fruit, if desired, and serve with honey, jam or syrup of your choice.
  Yields 4-5 Serv.

  1 2/3 c  ;water, cold
      1 ts Salt
      1 tb Yeast, dry
      1 tb Honey
 
  :    Heat 3 cups of flour for 2 minutes in the microwave.
  :    While that's happening, measure the water. Add salt, dry yeast
  and a dollop of honey. It looks like a mess, but don't worry about it.
  :
    Quickly take the hot flour and mix in the water combo with an
  electric mixer. It should be sticky and gooey. If your mixer is
  having trouble, just add more water. Mix it around as long as you
  want. :    Now, cover it, put it in a cool place, go away and ignore
  it. Go to work, take a walk, go to sleep, whatever. If you happen to
  pass the poor neglected thing during the day, pound it around a
  little with a wet spoon. If you are going to ignore it for more than
  8 hours, put it in the refrigerator. If you are in a hurry, ignore
  the ignoring part and proceed to the next step.
  :       Pound your sticky dough around with a wet spoon to pop all the
  bubbles, then slop it into a well oiled bread pan ( do not whisper
  sweet nothings in its ear ). Set a timer and let the dough rise in a
  warm spot for 10 minutes. If it was kept in the refrigerator, let it
  sit a little longer. Set your timer again for 10 minutes and turn on
  your oven at 350 degrees. When it's hot, put the bread in and set the
  timer for 50 minutes.

 Categories: Muffins
      Yield: 8 Muffins
 
  1 3/4 c  ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR
  2 1/4 ts BAKING POWDER
    1/2 ts SALT
    2/3 c  GRANULATED SUGAR
    1/2 c  BUTTER
    1/4 ts PURE VANILLA EXTRACT
    1/4 c  HONEY
      1 ts ORANGE ZEST
      2 lg EGGS
      4 md BANANAS, over-ripe (BLACK),
           -mashed
    1/3 c  BLACK WALNUTS, coarsely
           -chopped
 
  Preheat the oven to 350-degrees.
  
  Grease (or spray with PAM), 8 LARGE muffin cups. I put 6 in one and 2
  in the other; set aside.
  
  Sift together into a bowl the flour, baking powder (or baking
  soda--mine turned out great) and salt; set aside.
  
  In another bowl, cream the butter, sugar, vanilla and honey and add
  the orange zest. Beat in the eggs and bananas. Gradually add the
  sifted ingredients to the banana mixture. Fold in the nuts. Divide
  the batter among the 8 muffin cups, they should be about 2/3 full.
  
  Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a cake tester (or toothpick)
  inserted in the center comes out clean. I checked mine at 25 minutes
  and noticed they were browning on top too much, but they were still
  runny in the middle. I covered the pans with aluminum foil and baked
  for 5 more minutes, they were done.
  
  Turn out onto wire racks to cool completely.

 Categories: Sauces, Mexican, Condiments
      Yield: 999 Servings
 
      2 lb Serrano Peppers
  3 1/2 lb Roma Tomatoes
      1 lb Spanish Onions
     24 oz Tomato Sauce
  2 1/2 c  Distilled Vinegar
    1/4 c  Salt
    1/4 c  Black Pepper
      1 lg Head Of Garlic
     20    1/2 Pint Canning Jars & Lids
 
  Clean and stem the peppers.  Clean and quarter the tomatoes and
  onions. Use a food processor to shred the tomatoes, peppers and
  onions. Use the largest shredding blade and don't worry about a few
  large pieces. Place in a large stock pot. Puree or press the garlic
  and add to the pot. Add remaining ingredients to the pot along with
  enough water to keep the mixture from burning when heated. Bring the
  mixture to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Put salsa
  into the canning jars and process for 15 minutes at a rolling boil
  (open canning method). This salsa is tasty but quite hot. It needs
  about 3 years to mellow and mature. If you really like food that is
  hot it is edible immediately.

      Title: SUPER TURKEY ENCHILADAS
 Categories: Main dish, Tex-mex, Chicken, Poultry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Turkey; shredded cooked
  1 1/2 c  Sharp cheese; shredded
    1/2 c  Onion; chopped
      1 c  Cream of mushroom soup
      1 c  Tomato soup
     10 oz Enchilada sauce; mild
     12    Corn tortillas
 
  Just tried this last night and it was so good I wanted to share it.
  It's from the back of a can of El Paso enchilada sauce - but I
  substituted cooked turkey from our last "bird" that I had in the
  freezer. I originally called for cooked shredded beef. Combine
  turkey, onion and 1/2 cup cheese and set aside. Combine soups and
  sauce. Dip tortillas in hot oil a few seconds on each side to ..
  soften. (I used the microwave to heat them up) Top each with a
  heaping tablespoon turkey mixture, roll up and place seam side down
  in 13x9 inch baking dish. Pour sauce over and top with 1 cup cheese.
  Bake 350 degrees for 1/2 hour.

 Categories: Entrees
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Steak, cheap
           -(not too fatty)
      1 lb Tomatoes, stewed
      1 lb Tomatoes, whole
    1/2 lb Tomato sauce
      1 c  Water (or beer)
    1/4 c  Chili seasoning
           -(*see note below)
      1 lg Red onion,
           -chopped coarse
      2    Garlic cloves,
           -minced or crushed
           Jalapeno peppers
           -(fresh), seeded and
           -minced (2-6)
           Arbole or serrano
           -peppers (dried),
           -whole (2-6)
      3    Anaheim or California
           -(large) chilis,
           -chopped coarse
      1    Bell pepper, red or
           -green (optional)
      2 tb Brown sugar
      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Black pepper
      4 tb Masa flour
      2 c  Pinto beans, cooked
 
  Trim the meat of all visible fat.  If there is a large strip of fat
  on one side of the meat, save it whole. Cut meat into 1/4-inch cubes
  and brown it in a frying pan.
  
  In a large chili pot, place tomatoes, tomato sauce and water or beer.
  Bring to a slow boil.  Add the meat, chili seasoning, onion, garlic,
  peppers, sugar, salt and pepper. If you are using the optional bell
  pepper, cut it into 1-inch strips and add them now. If you have that
  large piece of steak fat, add it now; if not, add about 1 T of
  cooking oil. Cover and reduce heat, simmer at least one hour (two to
  three is better) stirring occasionally. At the end of the simmering
  remove and discard the piece of steak fat.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A hearty (and hot) Texas-style chili -- This is a chili
  traditional in our Super-Bowl Sunday festivities. It has won several
  "no holds barred" (non ICS) chili cookoffs where there are no
  specific rules. It is the result of countless changes and adjustments
  of a small group of chili aficionados (aka chiliheads). Note: there
  is a range of peppers specified, you may adjust the "temperature" of
  the resultant chili, mild if you use the low end, or nuclear if you
  use the high end (we do!). Yield: serves 6-8.
  
  *  Mix the masa flour with about 1/4 cup water and add to chili pot
  along with the pinto beans (or any kind you prefer). Simmer an
  additional 30 minutes. Serve. If you have made the nuclear version,
  make sure there is plenty of beer on hand.
  
  *  For chili seasoning, we make up batches consisting of 8 parts chili
  powder, 2 parts ground cumin, and 1 part crushed (not ground) cayenne
  peppers.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30 minutes preparation, 1 1/2 to 3 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: SUPERIOR WHIPPING CREAM
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 2 Cups
 
    1/2 c  Whipping cream
      2 ts Vanilla sugar
           -(or use white sugar
           -and about 1/2 t
           -vanilla extract)
 
  Shake the carton of whipping cream well and pour it into the blender
  or food processor. Add the vanilla sugar (see below if you don't know
  what vanilla sugar is.)
  
  Whip the cream in the machine.  If it's a food processor, leave the
  pushing device out; if a blender, remove the center of the lid, or
  just cover the top of the jar with your hand. The trick is to allow
  lots of air into the cream. Run the machine for no more than five
  seconds at a time, to avoid making butter. The cream is done when it
  holds a peak.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple way to make whipped cream extra yummy -- There is almost
  no dessert that can't be improved by adding a dollop of whipping
  cream. Unfortunately, most people seem to be afraid of actually
  whipping the cream, so they buy the awful stuff that comes in a
  pressurized can, or spend money on expensive devices to inject gas
  into the cream. (Or worse, they use Cool Whip.) The truth is that
  making your own whipped cream is trivial, with the appropriate
  mechanical aids. Yield: makes about 2 cups.
  
  *  If you don't know what vanilla sugar is, don't panic. My mother
  makes this variation in a separate sugar container; fill the
  container with sugar, add a vanilla bean and wait. After a week or
  two, the sugar will take on the vanilla flavor. Use this sugar
  whenever a recipe calls for sugar and vanilla extract; just remember
  to keep the container full.
  
  *  If you don't have vanilla sugar around, use regular sugar and
  vanilla extract for the cream.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  1 minute.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: SUPREME OF OLD HEN
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      5 lb Fowl
      2 ea Apples, tart, cored, slice
    1/2 c  Wine, dry, white
      2 cn Chicken stock, cond
      1 x  Tarragon
      1 x  Parmesan cheese, grate

      1 x  Basil
      1 x  Chicken base
      1 x  Beurre manie
      1 x  Cilantro
 
  It is best that the hen you use died of old age or at least was on
  Social Security in her later years. The chicken should stew for 1 to
  3 hours and a frying chicken would fall apart. Use a stewing fowl.
  Disjoint the pieces and fry until slightly browned. Remove. Add wine,
  apples, celery, onion, a few leaves of cilantro, basil, a pinch of
  tarragon and 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of paprika to pot. Cover and stir
  frequently until mixture is tender. Add chicken and stock, cover and
  cook until chicken is just tender. It may take from 1 to 3 hours
  depending on age of chicken. Check frequently so you don't overcook.
  Remove and place chicken in a shallow roasting pan. Run vegetables
  through food mill. If there is too much liquid, boil down. Thicken
  with beurre manie, add sour cream and heat - but not to boiling. Add
  chicken base or bouillion cubes instead of salt. Pour over chicken
  and sprinkle with grated parmesan cheese. Place under broiler until
  cheese is bubbling and slightly brown. Modified from Becker's "Joy of

      3 oz White wine
           Butter (salted)
      3 oz Tomato paste
 
  Mix the marinade ingredients.  Bone the chicken breast, obtaining 2
  supremes, and marinate for at least 30 minutes. Reserve bones.
  
  Cook a bouillon using the bones.  You will need about
        3 oz of bouillon.
  
  Drain, flatten and flour the supremes.  Saute quickly in clarified
  butter, about two minutes on each side. Remove and keep warm.
  
  Raise the heat to high, add wine, lime juice, tomato paste and
  bouillon. Cook down until it looks like it's been cooked too much.
  Remove from heat and swirl in a goodly chunk of butter. If you remove
  the sauce too soon, it will be too soupy. The sauce should be
  cinnamon-coloured and shiny. There will be very little sauce, you may
  need a rubber scraper to get it out of the pan.
  
  Serve with rice or some other bland vegetable.
  
  Experiment with the sauce, varying the ratio of ingredients. I have
  just strained the chunky bits from the marinade and used that. Wear a
  raincoat when making the sauce. It splatters.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken breasts in tomato-lime sauce -- This recipe was originally
  posted to net.cooks in May of '82 by Martin Minow @ decvax. The
  French name means "boneless chicken breasts in red and green sauce."
  I like it a lot.
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate (judgment required).
  : Time:  30 minutes marinating, 10 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

      Title: SUR LE GRIL CHOPPED LIVER
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Fresh Calves' Liver
      2 tb Salad Oil
      3 tb Butter
      1    Large Spanish Onion, chopped
      1    Egg, hard-cooked, mashed
           Salt
           Freshly Ground Pepper
 
  With a sharp knife, remove the tough outer membranes from liver. In a
  heavy skillet, heat oil and add chopped onions. Cook over medium high
  heat until translucent and golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon
  and set aside. Add butter to skillet. Heat until melted. Add liver
  pieces. Over medium heat, fry liver until just done - 3 minutes on
  each side. Alternatively, liver can be brushed with butter and
  broiled. To test for doneness, cut a piece from liver slice. If still
  pink, continue cooking for 30 - 60 seconds. Overcooking causes the
  liver to be dry and tough. For finely mashed egg that disappears in
  the liver mixture, force egg through a wire strainer. For best
  results, separate the hard cooked whites from yolks and sieve them
  separately. Set aside. Fit meat grinder with a medium blade and place
  cooked liver and cooked onions in the grinder. Grind, then regrind
  the ground mixture. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the twice ground
  meat and onions mixture with the sieved eggs. Add salt and pepper.
  Taste and adjust seasoning. If desired, add a few drops of commercial
  gravy browning liquid to heighten color. Refrigerate for 24 hours
  before serving. Serve with slices of tomato, cucumber and dark rye
  bread. Serves 4. By Sur Le Gril's chef Claude Dubourg. From The
  Gazette, 91/02/06.

  peppers in half and core and seed them. With a sharp knife, cut very
  thin julienned slices of half, if the peppers are large, or whole
  peppers if smaller. In a large pot, add cold water. When boiled, add
  pasta, occasionally stirring to separate the pieces. Always time
  pasta after it re-boils. After seven minutes, taste a piece to see if
  it is cooked. When cooked to taste, drain and put back into pot (turn
  off flame) with a tbs margarine. Stir to coat. Heat a ten inch Teflon
  coated saute pan with half the oil. On med-low heat, saute the onion.
  before it just starts to brown, add the pepper pieces. saute for a
  couple of minutes. Add mushrooms until they are coated with oil,
  about 90 seconds. Remove to a bowl, leaving perhaps a three
  tablespoons of mixture in pan. While the vegetables are cooking,
  prepare the chicken by washing and drying the pieces. Place the
  flavored flour into a small plastic bag. Add the chicken and shake
  the bag to coat. Place the rest of the oil into the pan, turn up heat
  to medium and saute the chicken until light brown on both sides. Do
  not over cook. Add thyme and the cooked vegetables to the pan. Cover
  the chicken. Add 1/4 cup cold water to deglaze with the vinegar and
  juice. Lower the flame and simmer for five minutes until chicken is
  cooked through, but moist. Place pasta into plates and spoon rich
  brown mixture over top. Add chicken pieces and arrange over pasta.
  it's very good!

           -lb. veal
      1 c  Pork gravy or stock or rich
           -boullion (chicken or beef)
      1 lb (3 medium) potatoes, boiled,
           -peeled and chopped coarsely
      1 tb Chopped celery leaves
           -(optional)
      2 tb Parsley, chopped
    1/4 ts Each thyme, and either
           -rosemary or savory
    1/8 ts Each ground allspice and
           -pepper
    1/8 ts Ground cloves
    1/4 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 ts Salt, or to taste
 
  FOR THE EGG GLAZE: Roll out half the dough from the Butter-Lard
  Pastry on a lightly floured surface to 1/8 inch thickness. Fold in
  quarters, lift, and position in a pie plate. Trim a 1/2 inch
  overhang, brush with the egg glaze, then refrigerate the pastry-lined
  pan while you prepare the filling.
  
  In a frying pan, saute the onion in the oil until transparent. Add the
  garlic and saute 1 minute, then add the minced pork. Saute about 3
  minutes, then add the veal (if you are using it) and saute until the
  meats are browned. Break up any clumps with a wooden spoon. Add about
  1/2 cup stock, cover the pan, and simmer about 15 minutes to cook the
  meat through. Uncover the frying pan and check the liquid. Remove all
  but 2 or 3 tbsp. of the meat juice and stock. Add the potatoes,
  celery leaves, parsley, herbs and spices, and stir to blend. Add
  salt, taste, and adjust the seasoning. Add, if necessary, just enough
  additional gravy or stock to moisten the mixture well without making
  it watery.
  
  Spoon the mixture into the prepared pastry shell. Brush some egg
  glaze on the overhang of the lower crust. Roll out the top crust on a
  lightly floured surface, fold in quarters, lift, and position it over
  the pie. Trim a 3/4 inch overhang, then fold the top edge under the
  bottom crust overhang and pinch the two together to seal, making a
  raised rim all around. Flute the edge as desired.
  
  Bake in the lower third of a preheated 425-degree oven for 15 minutes.
  Reduce the heat to 350 degress, raise the pie to the center of the
  oven, and continue baking about 45 to 55 minutes longer until golden
  brown. Check halfway through the baking time and add a foil edging to
  protect the crust from overbrowning if necessary. Cool slightly on a
  wire rack, then serve hot or warm.

        x  Sea salt and fresh ground
           Pepper
        x  Squeeze of lemon
        x  Fresh cilantro leaves
 
  Pulse first 3 ingredients a little. Add remaining ingredients and
  pulse. Enjoy.
  
  *Not necessary to roast, but extra delicious if you do. Just turn the
  peppers over a hot burner until skins turn black and blister. Peel
  most off as soon as they're slightly cool, but don't be over-fussy.
  The little black bits make the salsa look and taste just like the
  best restaurants'.
  
  **Susan says that Progresso brand is essential.  She's tried others,
  but this makes the best.

 Categories: Oriental, Vegetables, Rice
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
      4 c  Rice;Short Grain
      4    Water;cups
      4 ts Sugar
    1/2 c  Vinegar;Rice or mild white
      6 tb Sugar
      4 ts Salt
      4 ts Mirin or Dry Sherry
 
  Put 4 cups short-grain rice into a large, heavy pan. Add 4 cups cold
  water and 4 teaspoons sugar; soak about 2 hours. Cover and bring to a
  boil on high heat until the water begins to spew out from the lid.
  Without lifting the lid, turn heat immediately to low (on an electric
  range, have one of the units preheated to low and immediately
  transfer the pan of rice). Cook for 12 minutes on low heat; remove
  from heat and let stand 10 minutes, all without lifting the lid.
  Meanwhile, combine in a small pan 1/2 cup white vinegar, 6
  tablespoons sugar, and 4 teaspoons salt; heat just until sugar is
  dissolved. Also have ready an electric hair dryer or have someone
  standing by who can fan the rice mixture to cool it quickly as you
  add the vinegar mixture (this prevents the rice from becoming soggy).
  Turn the cooked rice immediately into a large bowl and carefully fold
  in the vinegar mixture while fanning or cooling it with the hair
  dryer set on "cool", being careful to keep the rice grains whole.
  
  If you use a rice cooker, use a cup measure, and not the small one
  that comes with the cooker and let the rice & water stand for two
  hours before covering and turning the cooker on.

 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 28 Servings
 
      1 c  Boiling water
      4 tb Butter or margarine
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 tb Granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Grated orange rind
      1 c  All-purpose flour

      4    Eggs
           Olive or other vegetable oil
           Honey; warmed
           Ground cinnamon
 
  In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the boiling water, butter, salt,
  sugar, and orange rind.  Bring to a boil. Meanwhile, sift together
  the flour and baking powder. Add the dry ingredients all at once to
  the hot mixture, beating hard with a wooden spoon over medium heat
  until the mixture forms a compact mass and leaves the sides of the
  pan. Remove from the heat and let cool for 1 minute.  Add the eggs,
  one at a time, beating hard after each addition; the mixture should
  be smooth, glossy, and thick. Heat the oil (which should be 2-1/2 to
  3 inches deep) almost to the smoking point, then drop the batter by
  tablespoons into the oil, without crowding, to form puffs.  When the
  puffs surface, turn them to fry on all sides, using tongs, then lift
  them out, drain off excess oil on absorbent paper. Place on warm
  platter and keep warm. If using the syrup, boil the syrup ingedients

      3 md Onions, diced

  Certainly if anyone were to insist that 'Maultaschen' were the most
  delicious of all Swabian specialties, I[=Horst Scharfenberg] would
  hardly be prepared to deny it. In fact, as indicated earlier, I
  suspect that 'Maultaschen' would have very good chances in a four-way
  international competition with ravioli, won tons, and pirogi for the
  championship of the Roughly Rectangular Pasta with Meat (plus
  Miscellaneous) Filling division. It has been said that 'Maultaschen'
  were originally invented in order to allow Swabians to keep eating
  meat during Lent by concealing it beneath the pasta shell and amidst
  the spinach filling from the eye of the parish priest (if not the
  omniscient Deity Himself). The following recipe is typical but far
  from definitive, especially where the ingredients for the filling are
  concerned.  Feel free to use whatever you have on hand or whatever
  your fancy (or your conscience) dictates. Dough: enough beef stock or
  salted water to cook the 'Maultaschen' Combine the flour, eggs, and
  salt in a bowl and mix to make a pasta dough. Then add a little water
  and knead until it has a firm but elastic consistency. To make the
  filling, melt the butter in a skillet and fry the bacon with the
  onions until both are quite translucent.  Combine the bacon mixture
  with the sausage meat. Moisten the hard roll in water, press dry, and
  put through the meat grinder (better than the food mill or food
  processor), along with the bacon mixture, cooked spinach, ground meat
  or smoked farm sausage, leftover roast, etc. Then fold in the eggs,
  parsley, and seasonings; mix together. The filling should be very
  spicy indeed. On a board that has been sprinkled with flour, roll out
  the dough into rectangular sheets (about twice as wide as you want
  your 'Maultaschen' to be). Take a tablespoon measure and put little
  dabs of filling at equally spaced 3-inch intervals all down the
  middle of one side of the sheet of dough. Mix together the egg and
  canned milk and apply it to the spaces in between, the outer edge and
  the fold line. Fold the plain half of the sheet of dough over to
  cover the filling, press down firmly on the spaces around the little
  packets of filling, and use a pastry wheel or knife to separate the
  packets into 3-inch square or diamond-shaped 'Maultaschen'. The
  process is similar to making ravioli. Cook thoroughly in beef stock
  or boiling salted water for about 10 to 15 minutes, dpeending upon
  the size of the 'Maultaschen'.  They'll bob up to the surface when
  they're done; remove them with a slotted spoon and allow to drain.
  Serving suggestions: Cut an onion or two into half-rings, fry in
  butter until golden brown amd empty the contents of the skillet over
  the 'Maultaschen' on the serving dish. Serve with slippery potato
  salad or a mixed green salad. Swabian Won Ton Soup: Serve a couple of
  'Maultaschen' in a bowl of hearty beef broths; garnish liberally with
  finely chopped onion. Swabian Fried Won Tons: Allow the boiled
  'Maultaschen' to cool, then cut into strips. Saute in a skillet until
  crisp on the outside. Serve with potato salad. Maultaschen Croque
  Monsieur: Arrange several portions in an ovenproof casserole, cover
  with boiled ham and a couple of slices lof cheese, and heat in the
  oven until the cheese reaches the desired consistency.  Serve with
  green salad. From: THE CUISINES OF GERMANY by Horst Scharfenberg,

    1/2 ts Vanilla
      4    Egg whites

  about 35 minutes.
  
  I never use the nuts and it still tastes great.  I never use more
  than one cup on sugar - depends on the sweetness of the apples I use.
  I especially like to use Fuji apples. Before baking I sprinkle the
  top of the batter with a touch of cinnamon sugar.  We enjoy this warm
  but it is ok cold too!

      Title: SWEDISH CHOCOLATE CAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 Cake
 
      1 c  Shortening
  1 1/2 c  Sugar
      3    Eggs
      2 oz Baking chocolate
           -(unsweetened), melted
      2 c  Cake flour
      2 ts Baking powder
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Baking soda
      1 c  Cream, heavy
      2 ts Vanilla extract
 
  Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Butter a Bundt pan and sprinkle with
  about 2 T dry bread crumbs, until it is well-coated. This makes a
  much better crust than flour does.
  
  In a large bowl, add the sugar to the shortening and cream well.
  Blend in the eggs, one at a time, and beat well. Stir in the melted
  chocolate.
  
  Sift together the dry ingredients.  Combine the cream and vanilla
  extract. Add to the chocolate mixture alternately with the dry
  ingredients, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Pour the
  batter into the pan and bake for 50-60 minutes. Cool the cake in the
  pan a few minutes before removing.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  A rich chocolate Bundt cake -- I got this recipe from my mom, who
  got it from an American book called Swedish Baking. I like to make
  this because it does not need to be frosted, which makes it an easy
  dessert. Yield: one Bundt cake.
  
  *  This is not an authentic Swedish recipe because their flour is
  different enough to cause problems in baking. However, the results
  seem authentic.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

      4 ts Bread machine yeast
    1/3 c  Chopped citron
    1/4 c  Chopped blanched almonds
      3 ts Grated lemon peel
           Green & red candied cherries

MMMMM---------------------------GLAZE--------------------------------
    1/2 c  10X Lemon flavored sugar
    1/2 c  10X sugar - plain flavor
      1 tb Water + as needed
 
  Place all the dough ingredients in the bread machine pan in the order
  recommended by the manufacturer, EXCEPT the citron, almonds and lemon
  peel.
  
  Process on Dough/Manual cycle. DO NOT USE THE DELAY CYCLE. According
  to your machine add the citron, almonds and lemon peel at the raisin
  or nuts signal beep or 5 minutes before last kneading cycle ends.
  
  Grease a large cookie sheet. (I prefer the air-cushion type as it
  doesn't over brown the bottom of the bread.)
  
  Divide dough in half. Roll each half into a 30-inch rope on a lightly
  floured pastry board. Place ropes close together on the prepared
  cookie sheet. Twist the ropes over each other gently and then loosely
  into a circle. Press the ends together to seal. Cover and allow to
  rise in a warm place 45-50 minutes or until double in size.
  
  Heat oven to 375 degrees F . Bake ring 20-25 minutes or until golden
  brown; cool. Drizzle with Glaze. Garnish with cherries if desired.
  
  Glaze: With a fork blend the sugars together. All of one flavor can
  be used if desired.  Add water and mix until smooth and thin enough
  to drizzle over the cake. Add or decrease water accordingly.
  
  *To make a SWEDISH CHRISTMAS CROWN: After bread has cooled, make
  holes for 6 candles in bread. Drizzle with glaze. Garnish with
  cherries and insert candles.

      8 oz Ground wholemeal flour
      8 oz Rye or barley flour
      1 ts Salt
      8 fl Lukewarm water*
 
  *You may need as much as 12 fl total.  -- Blend the flours together
  with the salt.  Mix in sufficient water to bind together into a dough
  ~- the quantity will depend on the types of flour used. -- Beat until
  dough leaves the sides of the bowl, then turn onto a floured board
  and knead thoroughly. Heat the bakestone over a moderate heat and
  grease it. Divide the dough into four and roll one quarter out into a
  round as thin as possible. Using a plate about 8 inches wide, trim
  the edges into a neat circle. Prick all over to prevent the dough
  bubbling while cooking. ~- Transfer to the bakestone and cook over a
  moderate heat for about 15 minutes, or until slightly colored. Then
  turn and cook the other side. Repeat with the rest of the dough,
  working up the trimmings for re-shaping and baking. -- Cool on a wire
  tray.  When cold, store in an airtight container.

    Roll the dough up to enclose the filling, starting from the 20-inch
  side. Seal the roll.
  
    Place on a lightly greased baking pan and pinch the ends together
  to make a wreath shape. With a pair of scissors make cuts almost all
  the way through the roll from the outside toward the center every 1/2
  ~inch. Pull the cuts outward and lay dough down with a cut side up.
  
    Let rise in a warm place for about 45 minutes, until puffy. Preheat
  the oven to 375 degrees. Bake the tea ring for 20 to 25 minutes until
  golden. Remove from the oven and cool on a rack. Frost with a

      Title: SWEDISH LEMON ANGELS
 Categories: Humor, Cookies
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Egg
    1/2 c  Buttermilk (or 1/4 c. milk a
           -nd 1/4 cup vinegar
      5 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Vanilla
      1 c  Lemon juice (fresh is best)
  1 1/4 c  Sugar
    7/8 c  All purpose flour
      8 tb Butter or margarine, melted
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 375 DEGREES 1. In a small bowl or 2 cup measuring
  cup, beat the egg until foamy. 2. Add the buttermilk and vanilla and
  blend well. 3. Add the baking soda, one teaspoonful at a time,
  sprinkling it in and beating until the mixture is smooth and the
  consistency of light cream. 4. Add the lemon juice all at once and
  blend into the mixture. Stir, but do not beat (you want it creamy,
  but without a lot of air) 5. The mixture will congeal into a pasty
  lump.  Scoop it out of the bowl with a spatula and spread it on a
  floured surface. 6. Sift the flour and 3/4 cup of the sugar together
  and use the fingertips to work it into the egg- lemon mixture. 7.
  With a floured rolling pin, roll the dough out 1/32' thick and with
  the tip of a sharp knife, cut out 'angel' shapes and twist the edges
  up to form a shell-like curve about 3/8" high. Sprinkle on the
  remainder of the sugar. 8. Brush each 'angel' with melted butter. 9.
  Place the angels one inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet and bake
  for 12 minutes or until golden brown. NOTE: Remember making
  'volcanos' in elementary school? This is the same classic chemical
  reaction disguised as a cookie recipe. Anyone trying this will wind
  up with a kitchen counter full of egg-lemon foam about 10 seconds
  after completing step 4. From Penn and Teller's How to Play With Your

 Categories: Desserts, Christmas, Mom
      Yield: 1 Quart
 
    1/2 c  Butter, unsalted
      2 lg Eggs, whites only
      1 pn Salt
      1 c  Sugar, granulated
      1 qt Pecan halves
      2 ts Vanilla extract
    1/2 ts Cinnamon, ground
 
  Set aside stick of butter to melt in a long pan. (Don't use a pan
  that has depressions around the side, such as for lasagna.) Preheat
  oven to 300 degrees.
  
  Separate eggs; sprinkle a pinch of salt onto the egg whites. (You can
  reserve the yolks to make custards.) Beat the whites to form soft
  peaks. Gradually add the sugar, cinnamon and vanilla extract. Fold in
  pecan halves.
  
  Turn out pecans and spread OVER the melted butter (don't stir them
  in). Cook for 15 minutes.  Take out the pan and stir the nuts. Cook
  another 10 minutes, take out and stir. Repeat until the nuts are
  separated and all the butter is absorbed (a little over one hour).
  
  BE PATIENT!!!  For a long time it will look totally disgusting and
  you will be sure I gave you a bogus recipe, but it works!
  Theoretically you can use other nuts, but I've tried both almonds and
  walnuts and was disappointed...

      1 c  Milk
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Flour
      1 lb Shortening
 
  Blend dry ingredients. Add milk and egg and beat until smooth like
  heavy cream.  Strain mixture. Heat rosette iron in 400 F. fat 3
  inches deep in a small saucepan or automatic deep fryer. An auto
  fryer is best as it is easier to keep the fat at the correct
  temperature.
  
  Tap excess oil off of iron batter on a paper towel. Dip iron in batter
  until 2/3 covered. Immerse in hot fat and fry until delicatley brown.
  Remove; tip upside down to drain. Push off rosette and drain on paper
  towels. Stir batter each time before dipping iron. Repeat. If iron is
  too cool, batter will slip off. Dust with powdered sugar and store
  airtight, in single layers seperated by wax paper. Best if served
  within a day or two (if they last as long as 2 days!).

  Variations: substitute other extracts for the almond extract, and
  experiment with coloring the dough with food coloring and trying
  different toppings.  In addition to the recipes following, I've also
  tried raspberry extract and red food coloring, and maple extract
  topped with walnut pieces and cinnamon sugar (put the walnuts on
  first, then the sugar!). I've used candy coated multi-colored mini
  chocolate chips for a topping, as well as the usual jimmies and other
  sprinkles.

 Categories: Corned beef
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      4 lb Fresh lean corned beef
      1 lg Onion, peeled
      4    Whole cloves
      6    Black peppercorns
      6    Garlic cloves
      2 sm Dried chilies
           Salt to taste
           Freshly ground black pepper
           -to taste
    1/2 c  Bitter orange marmalade
 
  When you buy corned beef, ask for the "first cut," which is the
  leanest part. If you prefer your meat more piquant, add a few chilies
  to the pot. Let the corned beef rest about 15 minutes after baking,
  for smoother, easier slicing.
  
  1. Place corned beef in a large, heavy pot; cover with water.
  
  2. Stud the onion with cloves. Add to pot along with the peppercorns,
  garlic and chilies.
  
  3. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low,
  partially covered and simmer for 2 1/2 hours or until meat is tender.
  Preheat oven to 350'F.
  
  4. Remove beef to a small, shallow baking dish. Set aside 3/4 cup
  cooking liquid. Sprinkle meat with salt and pepper, then spread
  marmalade over top. Pour reserved cooking liquid into pan. Bake 25
  minutes, basting occasionally.

  Judging when seafood is cooked just right is easier than most people
  think. As fish cooks, it turns from translucent to opaque. Don't be
  afraid to check by inserting a thin knife into the center or thickest
  part just before you think it is It is important to remove it from
  heat just before it is done because fish continues to cook off the
  heat. A general guideline to follow is cook at 400! or broil for 10
  minutes per inch of thickness, measuring the fish at the thickest
  part.
  
  Saut onions and peppers in oil in a medium skillet over medium-high
  heat for 2-3 minutes or until softened. Whisk together remaining .
  ingredients except salmon, salt and pepper. Pour into d skillet with
  onion-pep- per mixture and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.
  Remove from heat and keep warm. Cut center bones and skin from salmon
  steaks and cut into 1-inch chunks. Season with salt and pepper. Place
  on a greased baking sheet and broil for 3-5 minutes or until fish
  just flakes when tested with a for k. Serve salmon nuggets with a
  bowl of sweet and sour sauce for dipping. Makes 4-6 servings.
  
  ADULT VARIATION: Leave salmon steaks whole. Place on a greased baking
  sheet and broil for 10 minutes per inch of thickness or until fish
  just flakes when tested with a fork. Spoon sweet and sour sauce over
  the steak just before From the files of Al Rice, North Pole Alaska.
