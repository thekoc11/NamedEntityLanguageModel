      Title: Semolina Saffron and Pistachio Helva (Irmik Helvasi)
 Categories: Desserts, Ethnic

           Karin Brewer                        9 tb Unsalted butter
    1/2 ts Saffron threads                     1 c  + 2 to 4 tb sugar
      2 tb Hot milk                            2 c  Milk
    1/3 c  Shelled unsalted pistachios         1 c  Semolina
 
  Soak the saffron in the hot milk for at least 30 minutes. Heat a heavy
  frying pan and toast the pistachios with 1 tablespoon of the butter for 2
  minutes, until they are lightly toasted but still green. Remove as much
  skin as you can from them and set aside.
  
  Dissolve the sugar in the milk over low heat and keep the mixture hot. Melt
  the remaining butter in a heavy saucepan, add the semolina, and cook,
  stirring, over low heat for about 8 to 10 minutes.
  
  Stir the saffron milk into the hot sugared milk and add to the semolina,
  and cook, stirring vigorously.  Remove the helva from the fire, cover, and
  allow to stand in a warm spot for 15 minutes. Fold in the pistachios and
  serve warm or at room temperature in bowls.

      4 c  Cabbage; shredded              
 
      -----------------------------STOCK--------------------------
      ------------------------------SOUP--------------------------
                                         Approx. Cook Time:  8:00 Soak the
  porcini in 1 cup water for 2 hours.  Drain them, pat dry with paper towels,
  chop fine, and set aside.  Discard the liquid or save for another use.
  
  To make the stock, in a large soup pot, bring the meat, bones, and water to
  a boil over high heat, periodically skimming off the foam as it rises to
  the top.  Add the remaining stock ingredients, and reduce the  heat to low.
  Simmer, covered, until the meat is tender; about two hours.
  
  Meanwhile, melt half the butter in a deep skillet over medium heat> Add the
  cabbage and sauerkraut and saut# for 10 minutes, tossing and stirring
  regularly.  Add one cup hot stock (it doesn't have to be fully cooked) and
  the tomato paste.  Cover and simmer over low heat for 35 to 40 minutes.
  
  Melt the remaining butter in another large skillet and saut# the carrot,
  onions, celery, turnip, and mushrooms until soft and lightly browned; about
  15 minutes.  When the stock is ready, strain it into a clean pot. Reserve
  the meat and discard the other solids.  Add the sauerkraut and cabbage, the
  vegetable mixture, and tomatoes to the stock.  Season with salt and pepper,
  stir, and cook, covered, over medium-low heat for 20 minutes.
  
  Cut the meat into bite-size pieces and add it to the soup, along with the
  minced garlic.  Simmer for another five minutes.  Let stand for at least 15
  minutes, and preferably a day and a night, before serving; refrigerate,
  covered, and reheat slowly if serving the next day. Serve garnished with
  fresh dill and sour cream, if desired.

      Title: Sheftalia (Barbequed Sausages)
 Categories: Greek, Meats, Sausages, Veal
      Yield: 50 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                           -or- grated
    500 g  Finely ground fatty pork          1/2 c  Finely chopped parsley
    500 g  Finely ground veal or lamb          2 ts Salt
      1 lg Onion; finely chopped             250 g  Panna (caul fat from pig)
 
  Combine pork with veal or lamb, onion, parsley, salt and a generous
  grinding of black pepper.
  
  Dip panna into a bowl of warm water for a minute or two, remove and
  carefully open out a piece at a time, laying it out flat on work surface.
  Cut with kitchen scissors into pieces about 10 cm (4 inches) square.
  
  Take a good tablespoon of meat mixture and shape into a thick sausage about
  5 cm (2 inches) long.  Place towards one edge of piece of panna, fold end
  and sides over meat and roll up firmly.  Repeat with remaining ingredients.
  
  Thread sausages on flat sword-like skewers, leaving space between them.
  Number on each skewer depends on their length.
  
  Cook over glowing charcoal, turning frequently.  Do not place too close to
  heat as sheftalia must cook fairly slowly so that the inside is well cooked
  and the outside nicely browned without being burnt.  The panna melts during
  cooking, keeping the meat moist and adding flavour. Excessive flaring of
  fire can be controlled by a sprinkle of water on the coals. Serve sheftalia
  as an appetizer or a main course.

      1    Clove garlic, crushed          
 
  Rinse and peel the shrimp; set aside.  Rinse the shrimp shells, then put
  them in a saucepan along with the bay leaf, celery leaves, peppercorns,
  salt, saffron, and water.  Bring to a boil, then simmer for 20 minutes.
  Strain and reserve the stock.
  
  In a heavy large saucepan or skillet, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter; add
  the onion and garlic.  Cook for about 5 minutes or until softened but not
  colored.  Add the rice and stir to coat all the grains with butter.  Add
  1/3 of the reserved stock and bring to a boil, then simmer, uncovered,
  until the stock is absorbed.  Stirring, gradually add more stock and the
  wine until it has all been absorbed and the rice is cooked; this will take
  about 20 minutes.
  
  In a separate pan, melt the remaining butter, add the shrimp, zucchini, and
  mushrooms; cook for 3 or 4 minutes.  Fold the mixture into the rice along
  with the rice and half of the cheese.  Taste and add salt, if needed.

      Title: Sicilian-Style Sausage Patties
 Categories: Pork/ham, Italian, Sausages, Veal
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      2 lb Fat-trimmed pork (or veal)          2 ts Salt (or smoke flavored
           -shoulder, ground                        -salt)
    1/2 c  Chianti wine                        1 ts Fennel seeds
      2    Cloves garlic, minced             1/4 ts Each: black pepper and red
      2 tb Minced fresh (or 2 tsp.                  -cayenne pepper (or more to
           -dried) thyme                            -taste)
      1 tb Paprika                        
 
  Note:  It's not necessary to stuff meat mixtures into sausage casings. In
  fact, if you plan to barbecue, it's better to shape the meat into flat
  hamburger-like sausage patties that fit in pita pockets or on thin rounds
  of French or Italian Bread.
  
  To Make Patties:  Combine all ingredients and mix lightly.  Shape into
  patties, six per pound of meat.  Raw patties may be frozen for later use;
  Arrange them in a single layer on a cookie tin lined with aluminum foil.
  Cover with foil, label and freeze.  Patties may be barbecued or broiled
  without defrosting.
  
  To Cook:  Place patties 3 inches from heat source and broil or barbecue for
  about two to three minutes per side (three to four minutes each side if
  frozen); be sure meat is cooked through.  Makes 12 patties, 130 calories
  each with pork; 100 calories each with veal.

  little of the white underlayer as possible is attached. Set the yellow
  slices aside. Then peel the bitter white underlayer off and discard it.
  Slice the lemons into very thin slices. Place them into a container and
  cover them so they don't dry out.
  Boil the water in a large kettle. Remove it from the heat and stir in the
  yellow lemon peel, the sugars, and the syrup. When the sugars have
  dissolved, cover the kettle and let the contents cool to room temperature
  (25'C or 75'F). Then add the lemon slices and the yeast. Leave it to stand
  overnight.
  Place 4-5 raisins and a teaspoon of white sugar in the bottom of each of
  several clean bottles (wine or soda pop). Pour the sima into the bottles,
  straining it through a sieve to remove the lemon. Cap the bottle tightly.
  The sima will be ready to drink when the raisins rise to the top of the
  bottles, about 3-7 days depending on the temperature of the room where they
  are stored. Serve it well chilled.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
      8 oz Flour                               1 tb Milk, plus extra
    1/2 ts Salt                                1 tb Water
      2 oz Margarine                           1    Egg
      1 tb Olive oil                                Sesame seeds
 
  Put the flour and salt in a large bowl and make a hole in the middle. Into
  this hole pour the melted marg, olive oil, milk, water and beaten egg.
  
  Stirring from the outside into the middle gradually mix all the liquids
  into the flour until you have a dough. It will feel a bit oily, but is
  quite manageable. With floured hands shape the dough into rings about the
  diameter of a saucer and arrange them on a baking sheet. Brush them over
  with milk and sprinkle the sesame seeds on them. Bake them in a 400 degree
  oven for approx. 30 min. or until they are nicely browned.

  Serves: 4-5 Cooking time: 2 1/4 hours
  
  Wash tripe well, drain and cut into small squares or fingers.  Place in a
  dish, add lemon juice, stir and leave for 1 hour.  Place tripe in pan, add
  water to cover and bring to the boil.   Drain off water and remove tripe to
  a plate.
  
  Clean pan and add butter.  Melt over medium heat and add onion.  Fry gently
  until transparent.  Stir in parsley, fry 1 minute, then add tomato paste,
  water, wine and salt and pepper to taste.  Bring to a slow simmer.
  
  Return tripe to pan, cover and simmer gently for 2 hours or until tripe is
  tender.  To test for tenderness, take out a piece and pull.  If it breaks
  apart easily, tripe is cooked.
  
  Place in a serving dish, garnish with parsley and serve hot with pilaf and
  a tossed salad.

  [Looking at the ingredients, I figure that this'll feed 4 as a main course
  or 8 as an appetizer.  -- mkm] Preparation 1 1/2 hours. Cooking 1 1/4
  hours. Cook the snails in advance in a court bouillon, then remove them
  from their shells.  [There's a description of court bouillon in "Joy of
  Cooking."  Basically, a court bouillon is an aromatic liquid or stock,
  sometimes containing wine, vinegar or lemon juice, used mainly for cooking
  fish and shellfish, but also sometimes white offal (variety meats) and some
  white meats. -- mkm] Chop them, together with the peeled shallots and a
  small bunch of well-washed chives. Place these ingredients in a saucepan
  with the wine, cover and simmer for 1 hour. Meanwhile, soak the frogs' legs
  in the milk for 1 hour. Drain them, then roll in flour and saute in the
  butter in a frying pan over a brisk heat for 10 minutes.  Add the snails,
  together with their cooking juices, and season with salt and pepper.
  [Personally, I prefer to mill the pepper at the dinner table.  The smell of
  the freshly ground pepper would otherwise be lost.  -- mkm]  Turn up the
  heat and cook for a further 5 minutes. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and
  serve. White wines: Macon-Clesse, -Lugny, -Vire or -Ige, Hermitage, Crepy.

-----------------------------TO PREPARE SNAILS-----------------------------
           Wheat, flour and/or thyme                Salt

------------------------FOR FIRST RECIPE, TO SERVE 1------------------------
      1 lb Snails                            1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
    1/2 c  Olive oil                     

------------------------FOR SECOND RECIPE, SERVING 1------------------------
      1 lb Snails                              1    Onion; grated
    1/2 c  Olive oil                         1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
           Salt                                1 lb Peeled, chopped tomatoes
 
  The Greek gift for having a word for it applies richly to snails, usually
  called "salingaria" on the mainland, but "hohli" on Crete and "karaoli" on
  Cyprus.  Hohli are a favorite Cretan food, and the delicious cooking
  methods explain why.  Snails are scrupulously avoided except in summer,
  when they are considered safe to eat.  Since snails absorb the odors and
  taste of foods on which they feed, Cretans catch them after a rainfall, put
  them in a covered container, and feed them for several days on wheat,
  flour, and perhaps some thyme.  Then the real fun begins.  The amounts of
  the other ingredients in this recipe are based on a pound of snails.  One
  pound of snails serves 1 or 2.
      First be sure all the snails are alive, then wash them thoroughly in
  cold water and place in their shells in a container large enough to hold
  them.  Pour hot water over them to cover and bring to a boil.  Add a
  teaspoon of salt for each quart of water and continue to boil for 20
  minutes, skimming off foam.  Drain the snails, then wash in cold water and
  drain again.  In a deep, heavy pan, heat olive oil almost to the boiling
  point, using 1/2 cup olive oil per pound of snails.  Add the snails and fry
  for 10 minutes, turning carefully with tongs to avoid spattering oil. Pour
  in 1/4 cup red wine vinegar for each pound of snails.  Remove from heat and
  stir constantly for a few minutes.  Remove the snails to individual plates
  and serve hot with a little of the remaining sauce, and some bread and
  wine, as an appetizer or first course.
  
  SNAILS BRAISED WITH TOMATOES Prepare the snails for cooking as directed
  above.  In a deep, heavy pan, heat 1/2 cup olive oil per pound of snails,
  add some salt for seasoning and then the snails. Cover, lower the heat, and
  cook for 10 minutes, turning once. Add a grated onion and 1/4 cup chopped
  fresh parsley per pound of snails. Stir over medium heat for a few minutes,
  then add a pound of peeled, chopped tomatoes for each pound of snails.
  Cover and simmer for 30 minutes, or until the tomatoes are tender. Serve
  with fried potatoes and baby zucchini salad.

           - washed and sorted                      -(preferably homemade)
      2 qt Cold water                        1/2 lb Pepperoni or chorizo
      4 md Garlic cloves                            - or if available,
           - peeled and minced                      - Portuguese chourico or
      4 lg Yellow onions; peeled                    - linguica,
           - and coarsely chopped                   - sliced about 1/4-in thick
      3 tb Peanut, corn or veg. oil            1 c  Finely chopped fresh spinach
      3 md Maine or Eastern potatoes                - (leaves only)
           - peeled & coarsely chopped     1 1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Crumbled leaf thyme               1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 ts Ground coriander seeds              2 tb Olive oil
      1 lg Bay leaf; (do not crumble)     
 
  SOAK THE GARBANZOS overnight in 6 cups of the water in a large heavy
  kettle. Next day, add the remaining 2 cups water, bring to a gentle boil,
  cover, and cook 4-to-5 hours or until the garbanzos are very tender.
  Meanwhile, stir-fry the garlic and onions in the peanut oil in a second
  large, heavy kettle over moderate heat for 12-to-15 minutes until lightly
  browned. Add the potatoes and stir-fry 2-to-3 minutes; add the thyme,
  coriander, and bay leaf, turn the heat down low, and allow to mellow about
  10 minutes. Pour in the broth, bring all to a gentle simmer, cover and cook
  slowly. As soon as you've set the 2 kettles to simmer, stir-fry the
  pepperoni in a large heavy skillet 3-to-5 minutes--just until lightly
  browned and most of the drippings have cooked out. Drain the pepperoni
  well, reserving 1 tablespoon of the drippings. Set aside. Return 1
  tablespoon drippings to the skillet, add the spinach and stir-fry 2-to-3
  minutes over moderate heat just until glazed and intensely green; reserve.
  When the garbanzos are tender, puree 1/2 of them by buzzing 60 seconds in a
  food processor, adding only enough kettle liquid to puree them easily.
  Return the pureed garbanzos to the kettle in which they cooked. Now puree
  the potato mixture in 2 batches, buzzing each 30-to-40 seconds in a food
  processor. Blend the potato mixture into the garbanzo mixture, add the
  reserved pepperoni and spinach, cover, and simmer 30-to-40 minutes--just
  long enough to mellow the flavors. Season to taste with salt and pepper,
  remove the bay leaf, then smooth in the olive oil.

    1/2 ts Oregano Leaves                      1 c  Red Wine, Dry

    1/4 c  Flour                             1/2 c  Stuffed Olives, Sliced
    1/2 ts Rosemary Leaves, Crushed            2 ts Sugar
    1/4 c  Olive Oil                           8 oz Canned Mushrooms
      2 c  Hot Water                         1/2 ts Red Pepper, Crushed
    1/8 ts Nutmeg, Fresh Ground                4 lb Spaghetti
      4    Garlic, Squashed                    1 tb Season-All
     24 oz Tomato Paste                             Parmesan Cheese, Grated
      1    Onion, Finely Chopped             1/4 ts MSG
      1 qt Water                          
 
  Long, slow simmering of meat and herbs produces the base for this
  incomparable sauce. Season roast with salt; dredge with flour. In Dutch
  oven brown slowly on all sides in hot olive oil.  Add hot water, cover and
  cook slowly 3 hours or until meat almost falls apart. Tear into small
  pieces with fork. Add remaining ingredients except spaghetti and cheese.
  Cover tightly and simmer 2 hours longer, stirring occasionally. Remove
  cover and continue cooking until sauce thickens to desired consistency.
  Cook spaghetti following directions on package, allowing 1 pound for four
  servings. Ladle sauce over spaghetti. Top with cheese. Makes about 3-1/2
  quarts sauce, enough for 4 pounds spaghetti. NOTE: Since you may not need
  such a large quantity of spaghetti, freeze extra sauce in half-pint, pint
  or quart freezer jars and use as needed. I prefer to use rump roast, but
  chuck or round is acceptable.

      2 tb Butter or oil                       2 tb Chopped fresh dill
      1 lb Frozen spinach; thawed            1/2 lb Feta cheese; crumbled
      3    Green onions; sliced                3    Eggs; lightly beaten
      3 tb Minced parsley                           Salt & Pepper to taste

-----------------------------------PASTRY-----------------------------------
      1 lb Commercial Filo pastry            1/2 lb Melted butter
 
  In butter or oil, saute green onion until soft. Meanwhile, squeeze out
  excess moisture from spinach and chop by hand or in food processor. Combine
  green onion with spinach and remaining filling ingredients in bowl. Mix
  well and set aside.
  
  Lay out the Filo sheets, covering them with waxed paper and a damp towel.
  Take out two sheets at a time and keep the rest covered. Brush melted
  butter onto top sheet of each pair. Cut each double-sheet crosswise into
  equal strips, about 2-1/2" wide. Place 1 teaspoon of the filling 1" from
  the end (nearest you) of each strip. Fold the strips back over the filling
  so the bottom edge meets the left edge, forming a right angle. Continue
  folding back at right angles to make a triangular shape. Place on baking
  sheets and keep covered until all are ready to bake. Bake in a 350 degree
  oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden and crisp, turning once. NOTE-
  Spanakopitas may be frozen before baking. When ready to bake, separate
  while still frozen, spead on baking sheets, and bake as above, allowing an
  extra 10 minutes baking time.

  Wash spinach well and cut off any coarse stems. Chop coarsely and put into
  a pan.  Cover and place over heat for 7-8 minutes shaking pan now and then
  or turning spinach so that juices can run out freely.  Drain well in
  colander, pressing occasionally with a spoon.
  
  Gently fry onion in oil for 10 minutes, add spring onion and fry for
  further 5 minutes.
  
  Place drained spinach with onion-oil mixture in a large mixing bowl.  Add
  herbs, nutmeg, cheeses and eggs and stir to combine.  Check saltiness of
  mixture, then add salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Brush a 25 x 30 cm (10 x 12 inch) baking dish with butter and line with a
  sheet of fillo pastry.  Top with another 4 sheets, brushing each with
  butter.  Spread filling in pastry-lined dish and top with remaining fillo,
  brushing each sheet again with butter.  Trim edges if necessary and tuck
  pastry in on all sides.  Brush top lightly with butter and score top layer
  of pastry lightly into squares using a sharp knife or razor blade. Sprinkle
  a little cold water on top to prevent pastry curling up.
  
  Bake in a moderate oven for 45 minutes until puffed and golden brown.
  Remove from oven and leave for 5 minutes before cutting into portions for
  serving.

      1 c  Finely chopped spring onions      1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
    1/4 c  Olive oil                                Salt
      2 c  Crumbled feta cheese                     Freshly ground pepper

----------------------------------TO FINSH----------------------------------
     10    Filo pastry sheets                1/2 c  Olive oil
 
  OVEN TEMPERATURE: 190C (375F) COOKING TIME: 40 Minutes
  
  Wash spinach well and cut off any coarse stems.  Chop coarsely and put into
  a large pan.  Cover and place over heat for 7-8 minutes shaking pan now and
  then or turning spinach with a fork.  Heat just long enough to wilt spinach
  so that juices can run freely.  Drain well in a colander, pressing
  occasionally with a spoon.  (If using frozen spinach, defrost, drain well
  and chop).  Place in a mixing bowl.
  
  Heat oil in a frying pan and gently fry spring onion until soft.  Add oil
  and onion to spinach with cheese, herbs, eggs and nutmeg.  Mix well to
  combine, then add salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Open out fillo pastry sheets and cut in half, giving pieces approximately
  20 x 30 cm (8 x 12 inches) in size.  Stack and cover with cloth.
  
  Take a sheet and brush lightly with oil.  Fold in half to make a strip
  about 10 cm (4 inches) wide.  Brush again with oil and spread about 2
  tablespoons of filling across one long edge, leaving sides clear of
  filling.  Fold in sides, then roll up firmly.  Bend roll round into a coil
  and place in an oiled baking dish.  Repeat with remaining ingredients,
  placing in one layer in the baking dish.
  
  Brush tops lightly with oil and bake in a moderately hot oven for 25
  minutes until golden brown.  Serve hot or cold as an appetizer or light
  meal.  If serving cold, use butter instead of olive oil unless your oil is
  of high quality.

      Title: Spanakorizo (Spinach and Rice)
 Categories: Greek, Vegetarian, Rice/grains
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                    1/4 c  Chopped parsley
      2 tb Clarified butter or oil             2    Sprigs fresh mint; chopped
      1 sm Onion; chopped                           Salt & freshly ground pepper
    1/2 c  Raw long-grain white rice                Grated nutmeg
    1/2 c  Tomato sauce                        4    Hard-cooked eggs; sliced
    1/4 c  Water (or more)                          Lemon wedges for garnish
      2 lb Fresh spinach;washed,trimmed   
 
  Heat the butter or oil in an enameled pan, then add the onions and cook
  until soft and transparent.  Add the rice and saute for a few minutes,
  stirring constantly, then add the tomato sauce (or same amount of canned
  chopped tomatoes, drained) and water, cover the pan and simmer until the
  rice is almost tender (approximately 10 minutes).  Uncover and stir in the
  spinach, parsley, mint; season with salt and pepper.  Partially cover the
  pan and continue cooking, stirring with a wooden spoon until the spinach
  has wilted.  Grate a little nutmeg over the top and continue cooking until
  all the liquid has been absorbed and the spanakorizo is tender, not mushy.
  Remove from the heat and drape with a dry towel until ready to use.
  Transfer to a warm serving dish, and garnish with the sliced eggs and lemon
  wedges.  Serve warm.
  
  Note: To make Prassorizo (Leek Rice), substitute 1 1/2 pounds sliced leeks
  for the spinach and add with the liquid.  Leeks need longer cooking time.

      Title: Speckknoedel (Austrian Bacon Dumplings)
 Categories: Pork/ham, German
      Yield: 3 servings
 
      6 sl Slightly stale white bread        1/2 ts Salt (or to taste)
      5 sl Thick cut bacon                          Yolk of one large egg
    1/3 c  Light cream                         1 tb Unsalted butter
    1/2 c  Flour                             1/2 c  Sliced white onions
    1/2 ts Baking powder                     1/2 lb Rinsed and drained
    1/4 ts (heaping) caraway seeds                  -sauerkraut
    1/4 ts Dried thyme                         1 tb Chopped fresh parsley
    1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper    
 
  1.  Trim the bread slices and cut them into 1/2 inch cubes.
  
  2.  Cut the bacon slices into 1/3 inch squares.  Saute them over moderate
  heat in a large skillet for about 5 minutes. Stir frequently. Transfer them
  to paper towels with a slotted spoon, and pat dry.
  
  3.  Pour water to a depth of 3 inches into a wide bottomed pot and bring it
  to a simmer (in preparation for step 8).
  
  4.  Brown the bread cubes in the hot bacon fat for 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer
  them to a large bowl.
  
  5.  Add the cream to the bowl.  Gently toss the bread until it absorbs all
  the cream. Add to this mixture the bacon, flour, baking powder, caraway
  seeds, thyme, pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Beat the egg yolk and
  add it to the bowl.  Gently blend all the ingredients.
  
  6.  Shape the mixture into 1 1/4 inch spheres with your hands. (If your
  mixture is too dry, moisten it with a little more cream.) Place the
  dumplings on a plate as you make them, arranging them in one layer so they
  do not touch each other.
  
  7.  Melt the butter to moderate heat in a clean large skillet. Add the
  onions and saute for 2 minutes. Add the sauerkraut and the remaining salt
  and blend the mixture. Cover, and cook for 12 minutes.
  
  8.  Cook the dumplings in the simmering water for about 10 minutes (start
  this step as soon as you cover the onion-sauerkraut pan.)  You need not
  turn the dumplings as they will do that by themselves.
  
  9.  Transfer the cooked 'speckknoedel' to a warm bowl and cover them with
  the onion-sauerkraut mixture. Garnish with parsley and serve immediately.
  
  Serves 3 to 4.
  
  (Note: The ingredient listing does not show any butter, but the
  instructions do.  One Tbsp would do adequately, I would think.  (And back
  home, we would dust the onions with flour near the end of the roasting
  period, and add a little stock, to have the sauerkraut in a thin sort of
  gravy.  Karin.)

    1/4 l  Milk (1 cup plus 1 Tbsp)                 Salt
     10 g  Yeast (.35 oz)                           Topping B:
     30 g  Butter (2 Tbsp)                     2 c  Cracklings
           Topping A:                          2 tb Lard
    300 g  Raw smoked lean bacon,                   Salt
           -finely diced (10 1/2 oz)      
 
  From the Ries area.
  
  These bacon tarts can be made in two ways.  The dough base is always the
  same, however, the topping is different.
  
  Dough:
  
  In a bowl, mix the flour and salt.  Dissolve the yeast and sugar in half
  the lukewarm milk.  Form a well in the flour, and pour the yeast mixture
  into this well.  Dust the liquid with flour, and cover the bowl.  Let rest,
  in a warm spot, for 1/2 hour.  Then add the melted butter and knead and
  beat the dough until it starts to form small bubbles.  Shape into rounds
  that are about half a finger's width thickness and about 5 inches in
  diameter.  Tweak the edges of the dough into a raised rim.  Cover the dough
  circles with
  
  A) egg yolk and then lightly press in the bacon and add the remainder of
  the ingredients, OR
  
  B) lard and then lightly press in the cracklings.  Season with salt.
  
  Bake at medium heat for 30 minutes.  Serve hot.
  
  Serves 4.

      Yield: 8 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                    1/2 c  Dry red wine
      1 lb Small squid                         2    Cinnamon sticks
    1/4 c  Olive oil or corn oil               4    Whole cloves
      3    Onions; peeled, sliced              1    Bay leaf
    1/4 c  Vinegar                                  Salt & freshly ground pepper
 
  Wash and clean the squid, separating the outer sacs from the heads and
  tentacles, removing and discarding the translucent cartilage, and small
  sand bag and ink.  Rub salt on the outer sacs and rinse them inside and out
  with cold water.  Rinse head and tentacles thoroughly.
  
  Heat the oil in a pan, add the squid, including the tentacles, and onions,
  and cook slowly until the onions are translucent.  Pour the vinegar and
  wine over the squid and onions, then add the remaining ingredients and
  enough water to almost cover the squid, if necessary.  Cook, uncovered,
  over low heat until the squid are tender and all the wine has been
  absorbed, approximately 1 to 1 1/4 hours.  Remove the spices and bay leaf.
  Cut the squid into bite-sized pieces and serve warm or cold.

      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 pk Yeast                               1 c  Parmesan
      2 lb Ricotta                             3 tb Butter; in pieces
      2 ts Sugar                             1/2 lb Mozzarella, sliced
      1 pk Spinach, frozen chopped             1 ts Salt
           -(cooked)                           2 tb Butter; melted
    1/3 c  -Warm water                         1 c  -Ice water (without cubes)
      4 c  Flour                                    Sesame seeds
 
  Preheat oven to 200 degrees for 15 minutes and turn off.  Combine yeast,
  sugar and warm water in a small mixing bowl.  Set aside for 5  minutes
  until foamy.  In the workbowl of a food processor, add flour, butter pieces
  and salt. Process for 20 seconds.  Add ice water to yeast.  With the
  processor running, add yeast-water mixture gradually, until all of the
  moisture is absorbed and the dough leaves the side of the bowl. Process for
  an additional 60 seconds.  Transfer dough from the workbowl to a large
  greased mixing bowl. Cover with a kitchen towel and place in warm off oven.
  Allow to rise until doubled, approximately 1-1/2 hours.
  
  In a medium mixing bowl, combine ricotta, spinach and parmesan cheese.
  
  Punch down the risen dough and transfer to a floured rolling surface. With
  quick, hard strokes, roll dough into a large rectangle, approx- imately 1/2
  inch thick.  Layer one-half of the mozzarella cheese evenly down the center
  leaving approximately three inches of exposed  dough on either side. Top
  with ricotta-spinach mixture and the remaining mozza- rella. Overlap the
  exposed dough over the cheese mixture and pinch well on all sides to seal.
  
  Transfer to a large cookie sheet, seam side up.  Cover with a kitchen towel
  and return to the warmed oven. Allow to rise until doubled, ap- proximately
  45 minutes. Brush loaf with melted butter and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
  Bake at 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes or until loaf is well browned and
  hollow sounding when thumped.

  blending at low speed until the oil is completely incorporated. Add the
  chicken and process no more than five seconds. Add the pecans and process
  no more than another five seconds; the chicken and pecans should still be

      Title: Squid Stuffed with Ricotta and Spinach
 Categories: Italian, Fish/sea
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8 lg Squid (about 2 pounds)            2/3 lb Ricotta
      1    Medium-sized onion, minced          1    Egg
      1    Garlic clove, minced                1 tb Chopped Italian parsley
      2 tb Olive oil                                -leaves
      1 tb Unsalted butter                          Coarse salt and freshly
    1/2 lb Fresh spinach, trimmed of                -ground pepper to taste
           -stems and washed, or 1/2         1/2 c  Dry white wine
           -package frozen,                    2 c  Canned Italian tomatoes
           Thawed                              1    Lemon, quartered
 
  SQUID STUFFED WITH RICOTTA AND SPINACH
  
  Do not overstuff the squid or they may split while they cook.  Rice and
  braised
  
  fennel go well with this dish.
  
  1.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  Clean the squid and chop the
  tentacles finely. Set them aside.
  
  2.  Saute the onion and the garlic in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the
  butter until the onion is soft.  Add the tentacles and cook for 2 minutes.
   Add
  
  the spinach and saute, stirring, until it has wilted.  Drain off any extra
  liquid and cool the spinach.
  
  3.  In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta, egg, parsley, and the cooled
  spinach
  
  mixture.  Mix thoroughly and season with salt, pepper, and hot pepper
  flakes.
  
  4.  Stuff the mixture loosely into the squid and close the openings
  securely with a toothpick.
  
  5.  Use the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to grease a rectangular
  baking dish large enough to hold the squid comfortably in one layer.
  Arrange the squid in the dish and add the wine and tomatoes. Season with
  salt, pepper and more hot pepper flakes, if you wish.
  
  6.  Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the squid is tender and the sauce
  has thickened. If there is too much sauce, raise the oven temperature and
  allow the liquid to reduce. If there is too little, add more white wine.
  Serve the squid with lemon quarters.
  
  Yield:  4 servings.

  remaining ingredients, except the parsley.  Simmer, covered, for 20
  minutes, basting the squid with the sauce, if necessary.
  
  Uncover the squid and cook for 35 minutes longer.  Correct the seasoning
  and baste frequently.  Remove the bay leaf, sprinkle the squid with the
  parsley, and serve.

      2 lb Round steak; cubed                       --------pastry--------
  1 1/2 tb Worcester sauce                     1 c  Flour; + 2 t
    1/2 ts Salt                              1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Pepper                            1/3 c  Shortening
      2 tb Butter; softened                    2 tb ;water, cold
      2 tb Flour                          
 
  Wash the kidney, remove membranes and fat, and cut kidney in 1" cubes. Cube
  the steak into 1" cubes.  Melt the shortening in a heavy pot. Add the
  onions and cook, stirring often, until well browned. Add the steak and
  kidneys.  When the meat is browned on all sides, pour on 2 cups of boiling
  water, Worcester, salt, and pepper.  Cove and cook over a very low heat for
  1 1/2 hours, or until the steak is tender. Preheat the oven to 400 F. Blend
  the butter with the flour to make a beurre manie. Drop small pellets of
  this paste into the sauce and stir to thicken it. Put meat and sauce into a
  deep pie plate and sprinkle with parsley. If you wish to use a pastry
  topping, roll out the dough and cover the pie plate. Slash the top, crimp
  the edges, and bake about 30 minutes, or until well browned. Pastry: Mix
  the flour and salt. Cut in the shortening with a pastry blender. Combine
  lightly only until the mixture resembles coarse meal or very tine peas; its
  texture will not be uniform but will contain crumbs and small bits and
  pieces.  Sprinkle water over the flour mixture, a tablespoon at a time, and
  mix lightly with a fork, using only enough water so that the pastry will
  hold together when pressed gently into a ball.

      Yield: 2 servings
 
    1/2 c  Chopped candied citron              2    Eggs; slightly beaten
    1/4 c  Chopped candied angelica          2/3 c  Granulated sugar
    1/2 c  Golden raisins                    1/2 ts Mace
           :Boiling water                    1/4 ts Ground cardamom
      8 tb Butter                          5 1/2 c  All-purpose flour (about)
      2 pk Dry yeast                         3/4 c  Chopped blanched almonds
      1 c  Milk; warmed                        2 tb Confectioners' sugar
      1 ts Salt                           
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 350F. Combine the citron, angelica and raisins in a small
  bowl, pour boiling water over to cover, then stir and let stand. Melt the
  butter and let cool to lukewarm. Sprinkle the yeast over the milk in a
  large bowl, stir, and let stand a few minutes to dissolve. Add the salt,
  eggs, butter, granulated sugar, mace and cardamom, and mix well. Add 2 cups
  of the flour and beat vigorously until smooth. Add 3 more cups flour, 1 cup
  at a time, beating well after each. After adding the last cup, beat until
  the dough holds together in a shaggy ball. Turn out onto a lightly floured
  surface and knead for a minute or 2, sprinkling on more flour if necessary
  to keep it from being too sticky. Let rest for 10 minutes. Drain the fruits
  and raisins in a strainer and press firmly to remove excess water.
  
  Sprinkle the fruit and nuts over the dough, and resume kneading until the
  dough is smooth and elastic. Add a little more flour as necessary to keep
  it from being too sticky. Place in a greased bowl, and turn the dough about
  to coat all surfaces. Cover and let rise until double in bulk. (This dough
  is especially rich, and the first rise might take as long as 3 hours,
  depending on the temperature of your kitchen.) Punch the dough down and
  divide in half. Shape and pat each piece into an oval about 10 inches long
  and 4 1/2 inches at the widest part. Fold almost in half the long way,
  bringing the upper edge only about 2/3 of the way over, so the bottom edge
  extends beyond the top. Place the loaves on a greased baking sheet, leaving
  several inches between them. Cover lightly and let rise for 45 minutes.
  Bake in a preheated 350F oven for about 40-to-45 minutes, until nicely
  browned. Remove from the oven and dust with the confectioners' sugar
  sprinkled through a sieve, then transfer to racks to cool.

      Title: Strudel Dough
 Categories: Desserts, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           *INGREDIENTS*                     1/4 ts Salt
      2 c  Flour                             3/4 c  Water, lukewarm
           1Tbls.      butter or               1    Whole egg
           -margerine                     
 
  Source: Treasured Slovenian & International Recipes
  
  *DIRECTIONS* Mix flour, butter, egg and salt. Add lukewarm water and mix.
  Place on a board and knead for 10 minutes or more; or you may toss and beat
  dough on the board for about 15 minutes. The more you beat the dough the
  better the dough will be to work with. Place in a greased bowl. Cover and
  let rest for at least one hour.
  
  *HOW TO STRETCH STRUDEL DOUGH* Spread table with a cloth large enough to
  hang over the sides. Sprinkle lightly with flour and place dough in the
  center. With a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough to make an 18 inch
  circle. Slide hand gently below circle of dough and let the dough rest on
  the back of your hands with your palms down. Now pull the center of the
  dough gently toward you. Stretch and pull the dough as you walk slowly
  around the table. Dough should be thin as tissue paper. Then tear or cut
  off the thick outer edges, leaving about two inches of dough hanging over
  the sides of the table. Now proceed to spread on the desired filling
  immediately. Roll up gently by lifting the cloth and place your strudel in
  a well greased baking pan to bake.
  
  (You can also use this recipe for struklje)
  
  *VARIATIONS* The only difference is that Grandma uses a large cast-iron
  skillet to bake these. She says that you get a better crust this way.
  Because of the skillet, once you roll up the strudel (like a jelly roll)
  you must curl the strudel into a spiral shape to fit into the skillet.

  Remove crusts from bread. Chop bread into small pieces and place in a
  medium bowl.  Add 1/2 cup oil, parsley, garlic and salt and pepper. Mix
  well.  Arrange mixture between artichoke leaves and in centers. Place
  artichokes and reserved stems in a large saucepan. Pour water about 1 inch
  deep in pan. Add 3 to 4 tablespoons oil. Bring water to a boil. Reduce heat
  to medium and cover pan.  Cook artichokes 40 to 60 minutes, depending on
  size.  If water evaporates, add a little more.  There should be 4 to 5
  tablespoons of sauce left in pan.  If too much liquid is left, uncover pan
  and boil liquid down.  Spoon sauce over artichokes and stems. Serve hot.
  Makes 4 servings.

  (Yoghurt is something made by the Turkish people and is also eaten  in
  other Mid-East countries.  I've tried it and liked it but haven't been able
  to duplicate. Plain American yogurt is not my idea of a good substitute.)

      Title: Stuffed Cabbage with Rice & Pine Nuts Avgolemono
 Categories: Greek, Vegetarian, Rice/grains
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                    1/2 c  Pine nuts
      2 md Cabbage heads                     1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      3 tb Clarified butter                  1/4 c  Chopped fresh dill
      1 md Onion; chopped fine                      Salt & freshly ground pepper
      1 c  Water                               3    Eggs
      1 c  Raw long grain rice                 1    Lemon, juice only
    1/4 c  Raisins or currants                 2 tb Butter; cut into bits
 
  Plunge cabbages into boiling salted water and cook about 8 minutes, then
  drain thoroughly and set aside while you prepare the filling. In a heavy
  skillet heat the clarified butter, add the chopped onions and cook until
  soft and transparent.  Add the water and bring to a boil, then add the rice
  and stir.  Lower the heat and simmer gently until the rice has absorbed the
  liquid, approximately 15 minutes.  Remove from heat and add the raisins or
  currants, pine nuts, parsley, dill and season with salt and pepper. Cool.
  Separate 2 of the eggs and mix the egg whites into filling. Reserve the
  yolks for the avgolemono.  Stuff and roll the cabbage leaves, using one
  heaping tablespoon filling, roll up snugly, then place, seam side down, in
  a casserole.  Dot with butter and add water to cover, then cover cabbage
  rolls with an inverted plate and cover casserole. Simmer for approximately
  1 hour, then transfer to a warm serving dish and keep warm. Strain the
  remaining liquid for the avgolemono sauce. Beat the remaining eggs and
  yolks for 2 minutes. Continuing to beat, gradually add the lemon juice.
  Then add the 1-1/2 cups cooking liquid by droplets, beating steadily, until
  all has been added. Cook over hot water, not boiling, stirring constantly
  until the sauce thickens enough to coat a spoon. Pour over the cabbage
  rolls and serve hot. From: "The Food of Greece" by Vilma Liacouras

      Yield: 6 servings
 
  4 1/2 oz Yellow cornmeal                          -Italian tomatoes
      2 oz Freshly grated Parmesan             2 tb Salt-free tomato paste
           -cheese                             1 ts Dried basil, crushed
      1 tb PLUS 1 tsp olive oil              1/2 ts Dried oregano, crushed
      1 c  Chopped onion                     1/4 ts Dried rosemary
      3    Cloves garlic, minced             1/4 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      8 oz Ground beef, broiled on a           4 oz Part-skim mozzarella cheese,
           -rack until rare                         -diced
      2 c  Drained, crushed canned        
 
  POLENTA:  In a heavy medium saucepan, bring 3 1/4 cups of water to a boil
  over high heat.  With a large wire whisk, slowly whisk in the cornmeal in a
  steady stream, whisking rapidly and constantly to prevent lumps.  Reduce
  the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon,
  until very thick, about 15 minutes.  Remove from the heat and stir in half
  of the Parmesan cheese.  Coat two 9-inch square baking pans with nonstick
  cooking spray.  Spread the polenta evenly in the two pans.  Place the pans
  in the freezer for 20 minutes to chill.
  
  Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Add the onion and
  garlic; saute for 1 minute.  Cover and let steam 10 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.  Add the cooked ground beef, tomatoes, tomato paste, and
  seasonings.  Bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 15
  minutes.
  
  Preheat the oven to 450F.  When the polenta has chilled, spread half of the
  meat sauce evenly over one layer in pan.  Top with half of the mozzarella
  and half the remaining Parmesan cheese.  With your fingers, loosen the
  edges of the polenta in the other pan.  Invert the second pan over the
  first so that the drops out into place..  Spread evenly with the remaining
  sauce and sprinkle with the remaining cheeses. Bake until hot and bubbly,
  about 15 minutes.  Cut into squares to serve.

 Categories: Desserts, French
      Yield: 8 servings
 
--------------------------------PATE BRISEE--------------------------------
  1 1/2 c  Unbleached white flour              1    Egg yolk
      2 tb Sugar                               1 tb Fresh lemon juice
    1/2 c  Butter; chilled                     1 tb -Cold water, more if needed
           -- cut into small pieces      

----------------------------------FILLING----------------------------------
      5 c  Fresh or frozen blueberries         1 tb Cornstarch; dissolved in:
      2 tb -Water                              2 ts -Water
    1/3 c  Sugar                         

----------------------------------OPTIONAL----------------------------------
    1/2 pt Heavy cream; whipped           
 
  FOR THE PATE BRISEE, stir the flour and sugar together in a mixing bowl.
  Cut the chilled butter into small pieces and drop into the flour.  With
  your fingers, lightly and quickly rub the butter and flour together until
  the mixture becomes crumbly, or cut it in with a knife or pastry cutter.
  Whisk together the egg yolk, lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon of water.
  Sprinkle the liquid over the butter-flour mixture and continue to stir or
  rub this mixture between your fingers until a ball of dough forms.  Be
  careful not to overwork the dough.  If the mixture is crumbly, add up to
  one more tablespoon water, sprinkling it over the dough and lightly
  kneading it into a ball.
  
  On a floured board and with a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough into
  a large circle.  Gently lift it into a 9- or 10-inch pie plate or tart tin.
  Patch any holes in the crust with bits of dough and trim the edges. Flute
  the crust.  Chill for 2 hours.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375 F.
  
  Place a sheet of aluminum foil in the bottom of the crust and fill it with
  dried beans or rice to weigh it down during baking.  Bake for 15 minutes.
  Remove the crust from the oven and carefully lift out the foil and beans.
  Bake for 5 minutes more.  Cool.
  
  TO MAKE THE FILLING, heat in a small saucepan 2 cups of the blueberries, 2
  tablespoons of water, and the sugar.  Crush a few berries with a spoon to
  release the juice.  When the berries have softened and become juicy, add
  the cornstarch mixture.  Simmer on low heat for about 10 minutes, stirring
  occasionally, until the mixture thickens.  Remove it from the heat and fold
  in one more cup of blueberries.  Pour the berry mixture into the baked pie
  shell.  Top with remaining 2 cups blueberries.  Cool for at least one hour.
  
  Serve plain or topped with fresh whipped cream, if desired, or sweetened
  Creme Fraiche.

 Categories: Breads, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Beer, buttermilk, milk, or          1 tb Sugar
           -potato water                       2 c  Dark rye flour or light rye
      2 tb Butter or margerine                      -flour or rye meal (rye
      1 ts Salt                                     -flour with bran)
      1 tb Dry yeast                       3 1/2    To 4 cups unbleached white
    1/2 c  Warm water                               -flour
 
  Will have a more or less sour taste, depending whether it is made with
  beer, buttermilk, potato water, or milk, in that order.
  
  Heat 1 1/2 cups liquid to lukewarm.  Stir in the butter and salt.  Set
  aside to cool.
  
  Dissolve the yeast in the warm water (a temperature comfortable on the
  inside of the wrist) with the sugar.  Let stand for 5 minutes or until the
  yeast bubbles.
  
  Stir the yeast mixture into the cooled liquid.  Add the rye flour and beat
  until smooth.  Add the white flour, a cup at a time, stirring after each
  addition until enough is added to make a stiff dough.  Dust a work surface
  with white flour.  Form the dough into a rough ball, place it on the work
  surface, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rest for 15 minutes.
  Generously butter a large bowl or pot.
  
  Adding only as much flour as necessary to prevent sticking, knead the bread
  dough until smooth, about 5 minutes.  (The gluten in rye is more fragile
  than in wheat.  It needs a resting time to recuperate and reform and does
  not need as lengthy or vigorous a kneading).  Form the dough into a smooth
  ball and place it in a buttered bowl, turning it to coat all sides with the
  butter. Cover it and let it rise in a warm spot until doubled in size,
  about 2 hours.
  
  Punch the dough down, gently knead it for one minute, and divide it into
  two parts.  Form each half into a round loaf and place the loaves in two
  lightly buttered 9-inch round cake pans or on a large, buttered baking
  sheet.  Press a hole through the center of each loaf to give it a
  traditional shape if you wish. Cover and let rise until almost doubled in
  size, about 1/2 hour.
  
  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.  BRush the loaves with water and gently
  puncture the surface all over with the tines of a fork, in a design if you
  wish.
  
  Bake for about 30 minutes or until the bread is golden brown and sounds
  hollow when tapped on the bottom.  While it is hot, brush it with butter to
  glaze, and then let it cool on a rack.
  
  Yields 2 round loaves.

      Title: Svingi (Batter Puffs with Honey and Cinnamon)
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
      Yield: 28 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      1 c  All-purpose flour
      1 c  Boiling water                       1 ts Baking powder
      4 tb Butter or margarine                 4    Eggs
    1/4 ts Salt                                     Olive or other vegetable oil
      1 tb Granulated sugar                         Honey; warmed
    1/2 ts Grated orange rind                       Ground cinnamon
 
  In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the boiling water, butter, salt, sugar,
  and orange rind.  Bring to a boil.  Meanwhile, sift together the flour and
  baking powder.  Add the dry ingredients all at once to the hot mixture,
  beating hard with a wooden spoon over medium heat until the mixture forms a
  compact mass and leaves the sides of the pan.  Remove from the heat and let
  cool for 1 minute.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating hard after each
  addition; the mixture should be smooth, glossy, and thick. Heat the oil
  (which should be 2-1/2 to 3 inches deep) almost to the smoking point, then
  drop the batter by tablespoons into the oil, without crowding, to form
  puffs.  When the puffs surface, turn them to fry on all sides, using tongs,
  then lift them out, drain off excess oil on absorbent paper. Place on warm
  platter and keep warm.  If using the syrup, boil the syrup ingedients for 5
  minutes; spoon the syrup, or warm honey, over the puffs, sprinkle with
  cinnamon, and serve hot.

  Certainly if anyone were to insist that 'Maultaschen' were the most
  delicious of all Swabian specialties, I[=Horst Scharfenberg] would hardly
  be prepared to deny it.  In fact, as indicated earlier, I suspect that
  'Maultaschen' would have very good chances in a four-way international
  competition with ravioli, won tons, and pirogi for the championship of the
  Roughly Rectangular Pasta with Meat (plus Miscellaneous) Filling division.
  It has been said that 'Maultaschen' were originally invented in order to
  allow Swabians to keep eating meat during Lent by concealing it beneath the
  pasta shell and amidst the spinach filling from the eye of the parish
  priest (if not the omniscient Deity Himself).  The following recipe is
  typical but far from definitive, especially where the ingredients for the
  filling are concerned.  Feel free to use whatever you have on hand or
  whatever your fancy (or your conscience) dictates. Dough: enough beef stock
  or salted water to cook the 'Maultaschen' Combine the flour, eggs, and salt
  in a bowl and mix to make a pasta dough. Then add a little water and knead
  until it has a firm but elastic consistency. To make the filling, melt the
  butter in a skillet and fry the bacon with the onions until both are quite
  translucent.  Combine the bacon mixture with the sausage meat. Moisten the
  hard roll in water, press dry, and put through the meat grinder (better
  than the food mill or food processor), along with the bacon mixture, cooked
  spinach, ground meat or smoked farm sausage, leftover roast, etc. Then fold
  in the eggs, parsley, and seasonings; mix together. The filling should be
  very spicy indeed. On a board that has been sprinkled with flour, roll out
  the dough into rectangular sheets (about twice as wide as you want your
  'Maultaschen' to be). Take a tablespoon measure and put little dabs of
  filling at equally spaced 3-inch intervals all down the middle of one side
  of the sheet of dough. Mix together the egg and canned milk and apply it to
  the spaces in between, the outer edge and the fold line. Fold the plain
  half of the sheet of dough over to cover the filling, press down firmly on
  the spaces around the little packets of filling, and use a pastry wheel or
  knife to separate the packets into 3-inch square or diamond-shaped
  'Maultaschen'. The process is similar to making ravioli. Cook thoroughly in
  beef stock or boiling salted water for about 10 to 15 minutes, dpeending
  upon the size of the 'Maultaschen'.  They'll bob up to the surface when
  they're done; remove them with a slotted spoon and allow to drain. Serving
  suggestions: Cut an onion or two into half-rings, fry in butter until
  golden brown amd empty the contents of the skillet over the 'Maultaschen'
  on the serving dish. Serve with slippery potato salad or a mixed green
  salad. Swabian Won Ton Soup: Serve a couple of 'Maultaschen' in a bowl of
  hearty beef broths; garnish liberally with finely chopped onion. Swabian
  Fried Won Tons: Allow the boiled 'Maultaschen' to cool, then cut into
  strips. Saute in a skillet until crisp on the outside. Serve with potato
  salad. Maultaschen Croque Monsieur: Arrange several portions in an
  ovenproof casserole, cover with boiled ham and a couple of slices lof
  cheese, and heat in the oven until the cheese reaches the desired
  consistency.  Serve with green salad. From: THE CUISINES OF GERMANY by

      Title: Swiss Flan
 Categories: Appetizers, Swedish
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      1 c  Biscuit mix                         2 tb Butter
      3 tb Butter                              2    Eggs, beaten
    1/4 c  Light cream                         2 c  Natural Gruyere cheese (1/2
           FILLING:                                 -lb), shredded
      1    Onion, large, sliced or           1/4 ts Salt
           -chopped                       
 
  PASTRY:
  
  A Swiss cheese pie is called "flan." The pastry for this pie is sometimes
  closer to a rich biscuit dough, but in other versions a short pastry may be
  used. The word "flan" means different things in different countries; In
  Spain it is plain cramel custard, in France a fruit tart in pastry, in
  Switzerland a cheese custard in pastry. And sometimes Swiss Flan is made
  with onions and cheese in custard!
  
  TO MAKE THE PASTRY, chop butter into the biscuit mix, work in cream, and
  roll out on lightly floured board; or press into a 9 inch pie plate,
  fluting the edges. Chill while preparing filling.
  
  FOR THE FILLING, cook onion in butter until golden; cool slightly. Add
  eggs, cheese, and salt. Pour this mixture into pastry, and bake in oven
  preheated to 425 degrees F. (very hot) for 15 minutes; then reduce heat to
  350 degrees F. (moderate) and continue baking 25 to 30 minutes or until a
  knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Serve warm as a luncheon
  entree to 4 to 6 persons, or cut into small wedges for appetizers. Makes 10
  to 12 appetizers.
  
  VARIATIONS: Instead of this pastry, regular pie crust may be used. Or make
  pastry of 1 cup flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/3 cup
  butter, and 1 beaten egg. Do not attempt to roll out this butter-rich
  pastry; press it with your fingers into pie pan, fluting the edges.

      1 c  Roasted pistachios & almonds      1/4 ts Salt
      2 c  Sugar                               1 ts Vanilla
      1 c  Corn syrup                        1/4 c  Oil for pan
      1 c  Honey                                    Cornstarch (or see note)
    1/2 ts Cream of tartar                
 
  Note: Sweet rice flour or thin rice wafers may be used instead of
  cornstarch to line pan.
  
      Roast nuts on shallow pan in preheated oven at 350 degrees F for 10
  minutes.
      Combine sugar, corn syrup, water, and cream of tartar in a deep sauce
  pot.  Stir gently over medium heat until sugar dissolves and bring to a
  boil.  After it comes to a boil, cover pot for 5 minutes, then wash down
  sides of pot with a clean brush to remove sugar crystals.  Continue cooking
  on medium-high heat to 272 degrees F on a jelly thermometer. Remove from
  heat.
      In a separate pot heat honey to boil.
      Whip egg whites and salt until stiff and dry using a heavy electric
  mixer and large bowl.  Add a small amount of honey at first in a thin
  stream, very slowly.  Beat in vanilla and continue adding remaining honey
  and then syrup.  Beat until batch thickens and the beater slows down.  Add
  nuts and blend in.
      Oil a long shallow pan.  Sift a thick layer of cornstarch or sweet rice
  flour over it or lay rice wafers over bottom.  Pour out the nougat. Dust
  top with more rice flour or thin rice wafers and let stand overnight to
  set.  Cut into rectangular pieces about 3/4" by 1" and wrap individually in
  heavy waxed paper.

  This cinnamon-orange marinade, characteristic of Balkan cooking, is a
  specialty of Georgia in south-central Russia.  The tabaka marinade is
  usually used with chicken and game hen, but it also goes nicely with
  swordfish.
  
  Remove zest of 1 orange and the lemon.  (This is best done using a
  vegetable peeler.  Be sure to take only the zest, not bitter white pith
  beneath it.)  Juice oranges, lemon and limes.  Combine juice and zest in
  bowl. Peel and mince garlic and ginger root. Finely chop onion. Add garlic,
  ginger and onion to citrus juices along with cinnamon, paprika, sugar,
  salt, black pepper, nutmeg, wine and oil.  Whisk to mix. Makes enough
  marinade for 1 1/2 pounds chicken, game hens and swordfish.

      Title: The Dreaded Haggis
 Categories: Lamb, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Sheep's stomach                     3    Onions, finely chopped
      1    Sheep heart                         1 ts Salt
      1    Sheep liver                       1/2 ts Freshly ground pepper
    1/2 lb Fresh suet (kidney leaf fat       1/4 ts Cayenne
           -is preferred)                    1/2 ts Nutmeg
    3/4 c  Oatmeal                           3/4 c  Stock
 
  Wash stomach well, rub with salt and rinse. Remove membranes and excess
  fat. Soak in cold salted water for several hours. Turn stomach inside out
  for stuffing.
  
  Cover heart and liver with cold water, Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover
  and simmer for 30 minutes. Chop heart and coarsely grate liver. Toast
  oatmeal in a skillet on top of the stove, stirring frequently, until
  golden. Combine all ingredients and mix well. Loosely pack mixture into
  stomach, about two-thirds full. Remember, oatmeal expands in cooking.
  
  Press any air out of stomach and truss securely. Put into boiling water to
  cover. Simmer for 3 hours, uncovered, adding more water as needed to
  maintain water level. Prick stomach several times with a sharp needle when
  it begins to swell; this keeps the bag from bursting. Place on a hot
  platter, removing trussing strings. Serve with a spoon. Ceremoniously
  served with "neeps and nips"--mashed turnips, nips of whiskey and mashed
  potatoes.

      Title: Three Meat Stew with Vegetables (Pichelsteiner)
 Categories: Soups/stews, German
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 tb Lard                                     -diced
  1 1/4 lb Pork and beef as well as            1 sm Celery root, peeled and
           -lamb or mutton (mutton                  -diced, OR 4 celery
           -gives                                   Stalks, diagonally sliced
           An excellent flavor), cut         1/2 lb Carrots, peeled and
           -into 3/4 inch cubes                     -diagonally sliced
      2 md To 3 md onions, diced               1 lg Leek (white part only),
           Salt                                     -washed and sliced
           Freshly ground black pepper         2 c  Beef stock
           Crushed marjoram                         Chopped fresh parsley
      3 md Potatoes, peeled and finely    
 
  Heat the lard in a heavy bottomed pot (or ovenproof Pyrex casserole or the
  like).  Lightly sear and mix together the meat cubes and the onions; season
  with salt, an ample amount of pepper, and a very little bit of crushed
  marjoram.  Remove two thirds of the meat and onions from the pot and set
  aside.
  
  Mix the potatoes and vegetables together; spread a third of these over the
  bottom layer of meat cubes in the pot or casserole. Sprinkle with salt and
  a little pepper.  Alternate 2 more layers of meat with 2 more layers of
  vegetables.  Each layer should be separately seasoned with salt and pepper;
  the top layer MUST consist of vegetables and potatoes.  Pour in the beef
  stock. Cover tightly and cook over medium-low heat for just about 2 hours.
  Cooking in a 350 degrees F oven is also possible.  You should not stir the
  stew, but you can tilt the pot back and forth to circulate the liquid and
  prevent the bottom layer from burning.  Serve sprinkled with chopped
  parsley.
  
  Variations:
  
  Savoy cabbage is frequently added to the roster of vegetables, and it
  tastes delicious.  Sliced kohlrabi would be fine as well.
  
  For a truly gourmet 'Pichelsteiner', 6 to 8 slices of bone marrow should be
  briefly sauteed with the onions at the beginning, then added to one of the
  in-between layers of meat.  Doubling of ingredients is advisable.
  Pichelsteiner tastes excellent reheated.
  
  Makes 4 servings.

  4.  Make a fully-dissolved syrup with 1/4 cup sugar, 2 Tbsp water, espresso
  and rum.
  
  5.  Brush a layer of the sponge cake with espresso mixture.  With a
  spatula, smooth about half-inch thick layer of the mascarpone cheese
  mixture on top.  Brush the second cake layer with espresso, and place it
  espresso side down on the first layer.  Brush the top with espresso. Spread
  on another half-inch of the mascarpone mixture. Repeat the procedure with
  the third layer of cake.  Cover the top and sides of the cake with a thin
  layer of mascarpone filling.

  Chef Andrea says, "This is a relatively new Italian dessert that is all the
  rage in Italy and New York.  The original version was made with lady
  fingers, and was scooped out in the manner of an English trifle. We took a
  fresh approach to it by substituting sponge cake for the lady fingers. It
  is so light that you don't eat it -- you inhale it."
  
  Having enjoyed this wonderful creation, I can assure you that it also is
  calory free.  (F.H.T)

      1    10-12" Sponge Cake 3" Tall               -Liqueur
      3 oz Strong Black Coffee Or:         1 1/2 lb Cream Cheese Or: Mascarpone*
           Prepared Instant Espresso       1 1/2 c  Superfine Or Powdered Sugar
      3 oz Brandy, Rum Or Your Favorite             Cocoa Powder, Unsweetened
 
  *  Cream cheese or mascarpone should be at room temperature.  Mascarpone is
  available at some Italian specialty food stores and some gourmet food
  stores.
  ~-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Cut across the middle of the sponge cake to form two disks, about 1"-1-1/2"
  thick, each.  Blend the coffee or espresso and liqueur together.
   Sprinkle the bottom half of the cake with the coffee liqueur blend, enough
  to flavor it strongly, but don't saturate the cake so much that it will
  collapse.  Mix the cream cheese or mascarpone with the sugar and beat the
  cheese until the sugar is completely dissolved and the cheese is light and
  spreadable.  Spread the bottom half off the cake with half of the creamy
  cheese, in a fairly thick layer.  Set the second half of the cake on the
  bottom half and repeat the process - sprinkle the coffee/liqueur blend and
  spread with the remaining cream cheese.  Put the cocoa powder into a wire
  strainer and coat the top layer of cream cheese completely with cocoa.
  Refrigerate the cake for at least two hours before cutting and serving.

 Categories: Desserts, Italian
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Egg whites; large                   2 oz Bittersweet chocolate; fine
      1 pn Cream of tartar                          -quality/chopped fine
    2/3 c  Sugar                               1 c  Butter cookies; crumbs or
    1/2 lb Mascarpone cheese                        -pound cake crumbs
      2 tb Dark rum                            1 c  Coffee; brewed/lukewarm

----------------------------------GARNISH----------------------------------
      2 oz Bittersweet chocolate; chop              -fine
 
  Put the eggwhites in a bowl of an electric mixer and put the bowl in a
  second bowl of hot water and let the whites stand, stirring occasionally,
  for 15 minutes.
  
  Add the cream of tartar and salt and bet the whites until they just hold
  stiff peaks. While the whites are being beaten, in a saucepan combine the
  sugar and 1/4 cup of water.  Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring to
  dissolve the sugar, and boil the syrup until it registers 240 deg. on a
  candy thermometer.  Add the sugar syrup to the whites in a stream,
  slowly,while beating and beat the mixture until it is cool.  Add the
  mascarpone, rum and chocolate and beat until well combined.  Divide the
  cookie or cake crumbs among 4 stemmed glasses.  Drizzle each portion with 2
  tablespoons of the coffee and top the crumbs with half the mascarpone
  mixture.  Layer the remaining cookie crumbs, coffee and mascarpone mixture
  in the same manner.  Chill the parfaits, covered for a minimum of 2 hours,
  or overnight.
  
  Garnish:  In a metal bowl, set over a pan of barely simmering water, melt
  the chocolate.  Line a baking sheet with foil and spread the chocolate
  about 1/8" thick on the foil.  Chill the chocolate triangles on the baking
  sheet until it is just set, but not hard, and with a pastry wheel, cut it
  into triangles.  Chill the chocolate triangles on the baking sheet until
  they have hardened and peel the foil carefully from them. Garnish each
  parfait with a chocolate triangle.

 Categories: Vegetarian, Italian
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lg Onion, sliced or chopped                 -I have
      1    Half Green Pepper, sliced                Left -- wheat, Italian --
      2 c  Chopped mushrooms [or less               The more kinds, the
           -to taste]                               Better]
      1    Clove Garlic, minced                2 cn Italian Tomato Paste
    1/2 c  Olive Oil [for sautee-ing           2 c  Mozzarella Cheese, shredded
           -the above]                       1/2 c  Parmesan cheese
      2 c  Newman's Own Italian                1    Egg, room temperature
           -Dressing                                Pepper
      1 pk Vegetarian Hamburger, Tofu               Oregano
           -Crumbles                                Salt
      4 c  Bread crumbs [I use whatever   
 
  [Also Meat-less Loaf, Vegetarian MeatLoaf]
  
  Created by James E. True
  
  This is a good hodgepodge of ingredients, and is quite tasty.  Really good
  on Sandwiches!
  
  Saute the chopped onion, garlic and olive oil in a saute skillet (at least
  8"), until glassy. Add the Green pepper, mushroom and HALF the Newman's
  Dressing, reduce heat and continue to saute until peppers are cooked (no
  longer crunchy).  Add seasoning to personal preference.
  
  Preheat oven to 425*.
  
  Meanwhile in a large bowl, combine the bread crumbs (I usually just take
  stale bread and tear it up into small pieces), one can of the tomato paste,
  cheeses and Tofu.  Beat the egg separately, and add to Tofu-Bread mixture.
  Combine until bread is thoroughly saturated.  Add sauteed vegetables and
  remaining Newman's Dressing.
  
  The Meatloaf mixture should be cohesive enough to form into a loaf, but not
  soggy.  If the mixture is too soggy, add more bread.  If the mixture is too
  crumbly, add more dressing, or tomato paste.  Tofu has a tendency to
  separate, so the more bread and cheeses, the better.
  
  Spray a loaf pan with a non-stick cooking spray, and spoon tofu mixture
  into pan, spreading to an even level.  Spoon remaining can of Tomato paste
  over tofu mixture, and spread evenly over the top.  Bake in 425 * oven
  15-25 minutes, or until juices bubble up around the edges.
  
  Delicious as an entree, even better sliced on sandwiches.  Refrigerate
  covered, or loaf can be frozen.

      Title: Topfenkuchen
 Categories: Cakes, German
      Yield: 1 servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Flour; sift on pastry board         2 ts Lemon rind; grated
    1/2 c  Sugar                             1/2 c  Sugar
      2    Egg yolks                           2 tb Flour
      1 c  Butter; softened                    4    Egg whites
      2 ts Lemon rind; grated                1/2 c  Raisins
  1 1/2 c  Cottage cheese; sieved            1/2 c  Almonds; slivered/blanched
      4    Egg yolks                      
 
   Make a well in the center of the flour and put into it the next four
  ingredients.  Quickly work these ingredients into the flour to make a
  smooth dough, adding a bit more flour if needed, to facilitate handling. On
  a floured board, roll out the dough into a 11X17" rectangle. Line a baking
  sheet with the dough and bake it in a moderate oven (350 degrees F>), for
  about 15 minutes, or until it is about half done. Let it cool.
   Add the 4  egg yolks and lemon rind to the cottage cheese. Beat the egg
  whites until very stiff, gradually adding the sugar, beginning when they
  have slightly stiffened. Fold the beaten egg whites into the cheese and
  spread the cooled pastry shell with the cheese filling. Sprinkle the cake
  with the raisins and almonds.
   Bake in a very slow oven (250 degrees F.) about 45 minutes. Let cool and
  cut into large squares.

      Title: Tortellini Alla Panna
 Categories: Pasta, Italian
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 c  Of cream (heavy or light)      
 
  Tortellini alla panna
  
  Tortellini alla panna is a basic of Northern and Central Italian cuisine.
  
  Tortellini (usually with a cured ham filling, but spinach or other fillings
  can go well too. Just don't use those dry tortellini packets you find on
  the shelf; choose fresh tortellini, or those you find in the refrigerated
  section of the store)
  
  Grated parmesan (enough to make cream thick) Salt Ham, cubed Butter or
  Margarine
  
  While you cook the tortellini, mix cream, Parmesan, and salt. Set aside.
  When they are almost cooked, melt a little butter or margarine in a small
  pan and saute the cubed ham until slighly red, stirring to keep it from
  sticking. When tortellini are ready, drain, and mix with cream mixture.
  Pour the contents of the ham pan over the tortellini, and mix. If desired,
  add some pepper.
  
  NOTES: 1. Add some salt to the water you use to cook the tortellini in. 2.
  Freshly grated Parmesan would be preferred. 3. Some people like to add some
  cooked green peas 4. The ratio of cream mixture, ham, and tortellini is up
  to the cook: some like lots of sauce, some just a little...
  
  This recipe is used also for tortelloni and ravioli...

  PREPARATION:  Make the Egg Pasta dough.  Roll as thin as possible and cut
  into 2-inch wide stripe or approximately 4-inch squares.  Grate the
  Parmesan cheese. For The Bolognese Sauce, dice the onion, carrot, and
  celery. Mince the garlic. Melt butter in saucepan over medium heat; add the
  pork and cook until it just loses its pink color, about 3 minutes. Add
  onion, carrot, and celery; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic;
  cook 1 minute. Add wine, stirring with wooden spoon to deglaze pan; simmer
  until reduced by 1/2, about 15 minutes.  Add heavy cream and nutmeg; simmer
  until thickened, about 5 minutes.  Stir in tomatoes and their juice,
  breaking up with a wooden spoon.  Cover and simmer over low heat, stirring
  occasionally, for 2 hours.  Season with salt and pepper. For The Bechamel
  Sauce, melt butter on low heat in a saucepan. Whisk in the flour and cook 1
  minute.  Gradually whisk in the milk and bring to a boil, stirring
  constantly.  Reduce heat; season with salt and pepper. Simmer for 20
  minutes. Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling, salted water until
  tender, about 3 minutes for fresh pasta.  Drain and refresh under cold
  water.  Pour a thin layer of Bolognese Sauce into bottom of baking dish.
  Arrange a layer of pasta on top.  Pour 1/3 of the Bolognese and then 1/3 of
  the Bechamel over pasta.  Sprinkle 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.  Repeat for 2
  more layers, ending with the Parmesan cheese.  NOTE:  Lasagne can be made
  to this point a day ahead (OR can be frozen). COOKING AND SERVING: Heat
  oven to 400F.  Loosely cover lasagne with foil and bake until warmed
  through, about 20 minutes.  Remove foil and put lasagne under broiler until
  golden brown, about 5 minutes.  Let lasagne sit for 10 minutes before
  serving.

      Title: Trifle
 Categories: Londontowne, Desserts
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Sponge cake;leftover                1 ts Cornstarch
      1 c  Raspberry Jam                       3 tb Sugar
    1/4 c  Almonds, slivered                   5    Eggs
    1/4 c  Brandy:*                            2 c  Heavy cream;or whipping
    3/4 c  Sherry                                   -whipped
  1 1/2 c  Milk                                8    Citron slices;*
      1 c  Heavy cream;or whipping             6    Strawberries; -OR-
      1    Vanilla pod                         6    Crystallized violets
 
  * Anne's note; I would use 1 cup sherry and not bother with the brandy *
  Citron is larger than a lemon. The fruit is not eaten but the rind is used
  as a decoration. Can be found in speciality stores, omit if you can't find
  it
  
  "Trifle, a favorite Victorian recipe, is the perfect party recipe. Make it
  well ahead of time of time, so that the sherry and brandy have enough time
  to seep into the cake. The charm of Trifle is its different textures. Since
  these also look interesting , Trifle should be served in a glass bowl so
  that the effect can be seen to full advantage. As an alternative serve it
  in individual glass dishes."
  
    Cut the cake into very thick slices and spread each piece with a generous
  amount of raspberry jam. Arrange the slices on the bottom of a large glass
  bowl. If you prefer to use individual dishes, divide the cake equally among
  the dishes. Sprinkle the almonds over the cake slices, pour on the brandy
  and sherry and allow it it to soak for about 40 minutes (but not longer as
  the cake will becomes soggy. *Anne's note, I like it soggy, and left the
  cake to soak overnight.) Bring the milk and cream with vanilla pod to a
  boil in a double boiler. Remove from heat and discard the vanilla pod.
    Mix the cornstarch with the sugar and eggs and gradually pour in the milk
  and cream. Transfer the mixture back to the double boiler and stir until
  the custard becomes thick and creamy; do not allow to boil.
    Let the custard cool a little and then pour it over the cake. Let the
  cake set and when it fully cooled, spread any remaining jam on top, then
  cover with whipped cream.
    Decorate the trifle with citron slices and crystallized violets or
  strawberry slices. Refrigerate until ready to serve.

      Title: Turkish Baklava
 Categories: Desserts, Turkish, Greek
      Yield: 24 servings
 
      1    Pkg Fillo Sheets                    1 ts Ground Cinnamon or
      1 lb Butter, melted                    1/4 ts Ground and 1 Stick Cinnamon
      1 lb Walnuts, chopped                         9 x 13 Pyrex Baking Dish
      3 c  Sugar, white granulated                  Pastry Brush
    1/2 ts Ground Cloves                  
 
  1. Chop walnuts to medium fine and mix with 1 cup sugar, 1/4 Teaspoon
  ground Cinnamon and 1/4 Teaspoon ground Cloves. 2. Melt Butter. 3. Cut
  Fillo in half so that each sheet fits the bottom of the Baking Pan. 4.
  Generously butter the bottom and sides of the baking pan and place the
  Fillo, one sheet ata a time, in the baking pan. Generously spread butter on
  each sheet of fillo as it is placed in the pan.  Every 6 to 8 sheets of
  Fillo sp[read a layer of walnut mix.  Continue layering Fillo sheets and
  walnuts until Fillo is complete.  Pour any remaining butter over top of the
  Baklava.  The secret to good flaky Baklava is to have each sheet of Fillo
  well buttered so that the sheets do not stick together. 5. With a sharp
  knife, cut the Baklava diagonally to form diamond shaped pieces. 6. Preheat
  oven to 350 degrees and bake the Baklava for 40 to 45 minutes or until
  golden brown on top.  Remove from oven and allow to cool completely. 7.
  SYRUP Mix one cup water, two cups sugar, 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves and
  either 3/4 teaspoons Cinnamon or the Cinnamon stick in a sauce pan and
  bring to a bnoil.  Simmer for 20 minutes. 8. Pour the boiling syrup over
  the cool Baklava and allow to cool completely again. When cool serve
  individual pieces with strong (Turkish) sweet coffee and dried apricots for
  an exquisite dessert.

      Title: Tyropita Trifti Thrakis (Thracian Style Cheese Squares)
 Categories: Greek, Appetizers, Breads
      Yield: 100 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                  1 1/2 ts Baking powder
    1/2 c  Butter                            1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Light olive oil                          -less, if cheese is salty
    1/3 c  Milk plus;--->                      1 c  Grated Greek cheeses
      2 tb Milk                                2 c  All-purpose flour (or more)
 
  Delicious!  And simple to make in a large batch for appetizers.  As made in
  Thrace, the soft-dough may be spread into a sheet and cut in squares before
  baking, or each shaped individually into daintly "bastounakia" (little
  canes or sticks).   The word "trifti" identifies the texture - crisp and
  crumbly in the mouth.  (They are also called "kourou" [cut small].) If
  making the individual "little canes," they should be half a (dainty) finger
  wide and a finger in length.  The secret of the crispness is in adding only
  enough flour to make a soft dough.
  
  To make about 100 1-inch squares:
  
  The mixing of the dough may be begun with an electric mixer, but should be
  finished by hand.  Beat the butter until fluffy, then lower the speed and
  add the olive oil.  Continue beating, and when fluffy beat in the milk,
  baking powder, salt, if necessary, and cheese.  Begin adding flour, but
  after 1 cup stop beating with the mixer and beat in the remaining flour by
  hand, adding only enough to make dough soft enough to roll into strips.
  Knead a few minutes.  Spread or roll on buttered sheet (jelly roll tray,
  cookie sheet, or any flat pan) to a thickness of half-finger's width and
  cut into squares of desired size (the smaller the better, since they are
  rich).  Bake in a moderate oven (350 degrees) for 20 to 25 minutes, moving
  to the top shelf for the last minutes to achieve a golden chestnut color.
  (If making the "little canes," the baking time will be 10 to 12 minutes.)
  Remove when done and cook on a rack.
  
  Note: Stored in covered tins, these will keep for several weeks.

      Title: Tzimmes and a Gahtzah Tzimmes
 Categories: Beef, Jewish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Beef plate brisket                  2 tb Flour
      2 lb Carrots                             2 tb Schmaltz (rendered chicken
    1/2 ts Salt                                     -fat) or shortening
      3 tb Brown sugar                         1 c  Carrot stock
           EINBREN or THICKENING:         
 
  From "Love and Knishes".
  
  "Tzimmes" is a word impossible to translate. Ask anyone, "What is a
  tzimmes?" and you get the answer, "You don't know what a tzimmes is?" This
  is not very satisfactory as you can see.
  
  The closest I have come to an answer is that a tzimmes is a mishmash. Now a
  mishmash is a hodgepodge and a hodgepodge is...not a tzimmes, believe
  me...it's a big thing in anyone's life. A Gahntze Tsimmes is really
  somethig to boast about--a big production! For instance, from a good
  tzimmes, a cook is entitled to make a gahntze tzimmes. (Some people think
  of a tzimmes as a dessert). In my opinion is a one dish meal usually served
  as the fourth course in a six-course dinner. A Tzimmes can be made from
  almost any ingredient. From my wall-to-wall carpeting I could make a
  tzimmes, and from my new mink coat I am justified in making a gahntze
  tzimmes.
  
  Of course, there are some people who think not. You will find people who
  will begrudge you anything. They will say, "She's got a mink coat so she's
  making from it a gahntze tsimmes. I knew her when she only had a Persian
  lamb."
  
  From all these things you can make a tzimmes, but most tzimmeses are made
  from carrots.
  
  Carrot Tzimmes
  
  Simmer brisket in water to cover till almost tender (about 1 1/2 hours). By
  this time the water will have boiled down to about half the original
  amount. Peel carrots and slice in half-inch rounds. Add carrots, salt and
  sugar to meat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer till carrots are
  very tender (about 45 minutes). Brown flour in a very small skillet,
  stirring constantly to prevent burning. When flour is very light brown,
  remove from burner. Add schmaltz and stir till smooth. Gradually stir in
  carrot stock to make a smooth paste. Add this paste to the carrots,
  stirring it carefully. Continue to simmer till stock has thickened (10 to
  15 minutes.

      1    Bouquet garni                       5 tb Scallion; chopped
           Salt; to taste                           Lemon slices, thin
 
                                         Approx. Cook Time:  2:00 In a large
  stock pot, place the water, smelts, onion, quartered carrot, leek, celery,
  parsnip, bouquet garni, and salt and pepper, and bring to a boil over high
  heat, periodically skimming off the foam as it rises to the top. Cover the
  pot, reduce the heat, and simmer for 35 minutes. Strain the stock through a
  fine sieve into a clean pot, pressing the solids with the back of a spoon
  to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids.
  Return the stock to the heat and add the salmon trimmings, wine, potatoes,
  and thin carrots. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer,
  covered, until the vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes. Strain the
  stock into a clean pot, discarding all the solids except the potatoes and
  all the carrots.  Rinse the potatoes and carrots being careful not to mash
  them, and set aside.
  Return the stock to low heat and simmer for several minutes.  Add the egg
  white and shell and increase the heat to medium high.  Bring to a boil,
  beating constantly, with a wire whisk. When the stock boils, the egg white
  will start rising to the surface.  At this point, turn off the heat and let
  stand for five minutes.  Line a colander with a double layer of dampened
  cheesecloth and strain the stock into a clean pot.
  Add the fish fillets to the stock and poach over medium low heat until
  cooked through; five minutes.  Taste and adjust the seasonings. Halve the
  reserved potatoes and cut into wedges.  Cut the carrots into fine dice.
  Divide the fish fillets among six soup bowls.  Add a few potato wedges and
  diced carrots to each bowl.  Ladle the stock into the bowls, sprinkle with
  scallions, and garnish with lemon slices.

  Place the rice in boiling water and leave for 5 seconds; drain, and rinse.
  Bring the milk almost to a boil in a heavy saucepan, and stir in the rice,
  the first quantity of sugar, the orange zest, salt, and butter.  Reduce the

      Title: Vasilopita (New Year Bread)
 Categories: Greek, Breads
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                    1/4 ts Salt
      1 pk Active dry yeast                  1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    3/4 c  Milk; lukewarm                    1/4 ts Ground masticha
      3    Eggs; beaten                      1/2 c  Butter; melted
  1 1/2 ts Grated orange rind                  1    Egg; for glazing
    3/4 c  Caster sugar                             Blanched split almonds
  4 1/2 c  Plain flour                    
 
  New Year Bread is traditionally cut at midnight on New Year's Eve.  After
  baking, a coin is inserted through a slit in the base.  The person who
  finds the coin will have luck in the New Year.  Long ago the coin used to
  be a gold one, then later a silver coin was used.  These could be
  incorporated into the dough before baking.  Nowadays because of the nickel
  content of coins it is undesirable to bake a coin in the cake.
  
  Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup of the milk.  Add remainder of milk, eggs, orange
  rind and sugar.  Sift 3 cups flour, salt and spice into a warm bowl and
  make a well in the centre.  Pour in yeast mixture and stir to blend in
  flour, gradually adding warm melted butter.  Mix dough with hands until it
  comes away from sides.  Turn on to a floured surface and knead until smooth
  and elastic, adding remaining flour as required.  Knead for 10 minutes.
  Place ball of dough in a clean bowl brushed with melted butter. Turn dough
  over to coat top with butter and cover bowl with a cloth or plastic wrap.
  Leav to prove (rise) in a warm place until doubled in bulk. Punch down and
  turn on to lightly floured surface.  Knead lightly and shape into a round
  loaf.  Place on a large greased baking sheet or in a greased 25 cm (10
  inch) deep cake tin.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled -
  about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
  
  Glaze with well-beaten egg and arrange blanched almonds in numbers to
  denote the New Year, pressing in lightly.  Bake in a moderately hot oven
  for 45 minutes until golden brown and cooked when tested.  If bread browns
  too quickly place a piece of greased brown paper on top.  Cool on a wire
  rack.

      Title: Veal Cutlets Parmesan
 Categories: Veal, Italian
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Veal cutlet                              -thin
    1/4 c  Bread crumbs                             Sauce:
      2 tb Water                               2    Onions sliced thin
    1/2    Beaten egg                          4 tb Oil

  Hint: Veal is very expensive. Instead, take partially frozen turkey breast
  and slice to 1/4 inch slices. As long as the turkey is coated on all sides
  with sauce, you won't be able to tell it from veal!
  
  Cut veal into serving sized pieces. Mix Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs.
  Mix beaten egg with water.  Dip meat into egg, then into bread crumb
  mixture Cook meat in hot oil until golden brown on both sides. coat cutlets
  with sauce on both sides and in pan. Lay thin slices of Parmesan on top and

      Title: Veal Stifado
 Categories: Greek, Meats, Veal
      Yield: 5 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                      1 lg Bay leaf
      2 tb Olive oil                           1 tb White or brown sugar
  1 1/2 lb Lean veal; in 1-1/2" cubes      1 1/2 lb Small white onions; peeled
      2    Garlic cloves                     1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
           Salt & freshly ground pepper        2 tb Butter; cut into bits
    1/4 c  Red wine vinegar                    1    Cinnamon stick
      2 tb Dry red wine                        3    Whole cloves
      3    Peeled tomatoes; chopped       
 
  In a baking-serving casserole, heat the oil, then add the veal and saute on
  all sides.  Add the garlic and season with salt and pepper.  Stir with a
  wooden spoon, then add the vinegar, wine, tomatoes, bay leaf, sugar, and
  enough water to cover the veal.  Arrange the onions over the meat, sprinkle
  the parsley and butter bits over the top, and slip the spices in between
  the meat and the onions.  Shake the casserole a few times, then cover with
  an inverted plate to keep in place and cover tightly with a lid (using a
  little flour-water paste around the inside of the lid to seal if you wish).
  Bake in a slow oven (300 F) for 2 to 2-1/2 hours or over minimum heat on a
  burner, until the veal and onions are tender.  Remove from the heat and
  serve warm.
  
  Note: After peeling the onions, pierce the root end of each onion with the
  tip of a small, sharp knife, then slash again at a right angle to make a
  cross.  This will keep the onion whole and intact during the cooking
  process.

    1/2 pt Champagne vinegar                   6 oz White or red wine
           Sweet Sauce:                   
 
  Sharp Sauce:
  
  Sharp Sauce:--A quarter-pound of the best loaf-sugar, or white candy-sugar,
  dissolved in a half-pint of Champagne vinegar, and carefully skimmed.
  
  Sweet Sauce:--Melt some white or red currant jelly with a glass of white or
  red wine, whichever suits best in color; or serve jelly unmelted in a small
  sweetmeat-glass.  This sauce answers well for hare, fawn, or kid, and for
  roast mutton to many tastes.
  
  Gravy for Venison:--Make a pint of gravy of trimmings of venison or shanks
  of mutton thus:  broil the meat on a quick fire till it is browned, then
  stew it slowly.  Skim, strain, and serve the gravy it yields, adding salt
  and a teaspoonful of walnut pickle.

      Title: Viennese Baked Apples
 Categories: Desserts, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6 lg Apples                            1/2 c  Finely chopped walnuts or
    1/2 c  Seedless raspberry jam                   -almonds
           Grated rind of 1/2 an orange        3 tb Sugar
 
  An old Egyptian dream book states that "to dream of looking at apples
  betokens a wedding.  To dream of eating apples is a sign of mourning unless
  they are very sweet, then it is a sign of a great deal of prosperity in the
  marriage state".  Apples have travelled from the Old World to the New, but
  for some reason, we haven't created as many interesting desserts with them
  as the Europeans.  We seem to limit ourselves to pies, crunchy puddings,
  applesauce and jelly.  This is one new way to try apples.
  
  When possible, use the large Rome Beauty apples
  
  Core apples and peel skin about 1/3 of the way down from the stem end.
  Pierce the rest of the skin all over with a fork to lessen wrinkling and
  splitting. Place apples in a large, deep pan that has a good cover and add
  water to a depth of 1/4 inch.  Mix jam with orange rind and nuts,fill the
  centre of each apple, then sprinkle sugar over top.  Bring water in pan to
  a boil, then cover, lower heat and simmer 20-30 minutes,depending on size
  of apples.  Baste 2-3 times with pan juices.  To glaze apples, uncover when
  cooled, sprinkle top with an additional tbsp of sugar and place under
  broiler 3 inches from heat until lightly browned. Watch closely, as they
  brown very quickly.  Serve warm, tepid or cold. Serves 6.

  *  Beet should be washed and dried.
  
  If you are using a fresh beet, preheat the oven to 375 Degrees F.  Wrap the

  Meanwhile, cook the potatoes in lightly salted boiling water for 10
  minutes.  Add the carrots and cook until the vegetables are tender, but not
  mushy, about 10 minutes more.  Let cool until easy to handle, then cut the
  vegetables into 1/2-inch dice.  In a large salad bowl, combine the
  potatoes, carrots, onion, pickles, peas, beet, scallions, and dill. Season
  with salt and pepper and toss gently, taking care not to crush the
  vegetables.  In a small bowl, whisk the dry mustard, sugar and vinegar
  together.  Whisk in the oil and season with salt and pepper.  Toss the
  salad with the dressing and tasting to correct the seasoning.  Cover and
  refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.

  flat in a large skillet, pour in the boiling salted water, set the pan over
  moderate heat, cover it, and cook the asparagus for about 5 minutes, just
  until they are tender, but still crisp. Meanwhile, lightly brown the butter
  in a medium skillet over moderate heat. Add the bread crumbs and pepper and
  lightly toss them to mix. Reduce the heat under the skillet to low, to keep
  the crumbs warm. The instant the asparagus are done, drain them well, then
  return them to the skillet and shake them over moderate heat for 30 seconds
  or so to dry up any excess moisture. Transfer the asparagus to a small
  heated platter, then artfully arrange the crumb mixture on top.

  reserved clam juices, wine, red pepper flakes and salt. Bring to boil &
  simmer for 10 min. Add minced clams, baby clams and parsley. Return to
  boil, then keep warm while preparing linguine. When linguine is done, pour
  sauce over top and toss gently and serve. I forget how many this will
  serve. Probably at least 4.

      Title: Wiener Schnitzel
 Categories: Veal, German
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 oz Veal slices (per person),                Salt
           -milk fed, pink in color,                Flour
    1/4    Inch thick                               Beaten eggs (1 egg per two
           Olive oil                                -slices veal)
           Lard                                     Fine dry bread crumbs
 
  Trim all fat from veal. Pound each slice as thin as possible (about 1/8
  inch thick). Make small vertical cuts all around the edges of the veal.
  Salt each slice. Dip first into a soup plate containing flour, and shake
  off excess; next into a soup plate of beaten egg; finally into a soup plate
  containing dried bread crumbs, pressing crumbs well in with the palm of
  your hand, then shaking off excess. Fry in deep fat, half olive oil, half
  melted lard, so hot that it smokes, for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or
  until heat is right when the breading ripples golden brown. Schnitzel is
  done and tender when a fork goes right through the meat. Serve garnished
  with lemon wedges and potatoes or salad as a side dish.

      Title: Wild Mushroom Risotto
 Categories: Italian, Vegetarian
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      3 tb Unsalted butter                   1/3 c  Finely minced onion
      4 oz Shiitake mushrooms;             1 1/2 c  Arborio rice
           - (or other wild mushrooms),      1/2 c  Dry white wine or broth
           -  stems removed, sliced            5 c  Broth
      4 oz White mushrooms                   1/4 c  Mascarpone cheese
           - stems removed, sliced                  -=OR=- Whipping cream
           Salt                                     -(or substitute skim milk)
           Freshly ground black pepper       1/4 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
      2 tb Unsalted butter                     1 tb Chopped parsley
      1 tb Oil                            
 
  You can substitute dried wild mushrooms for the shiitake. Just soak them
  for 15-to-20 minutes beforehand (and be sure to add the strained soaking
  liquid to the stock).
  
  HEAT BUTTER in small skillet over moderate heat. When it begins to foam,
  add mushrooms and cook for 3-to-5 minutes, until soft. Add salt and pepper
  to taste. Turn off heat and set aside. Bring the broth to a steady simmer
  in a saucepan on top of the stove. Heat butter and oil in heavy 4-quart
  casserole over moderate heat. Add onion, saute for 1-to-2 minutes, until it
  begins to soften, being careful not to brown. Add rice to butter-oil-onion
  mixture. Using a wooden spoon, stir 1 minute, making sure all grains are
  well coated. Add wine and stir until completely absorbed. Add simmering
  broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring frequently. Wait until each addition is
  almost completely absorbed (approximately 2 minutes) before adding next 1/2
  cup, reserving 1/4 cup to add at the end. Stir often. After approximately
  18 minutes (rice should be tender and firm), add 1/4 cup broth, mushrooms,
  Mascarpone and Parmesan cheeses and stir vigorously so cheeses melt.
  Sprinkle with parsley. Serve immediately.

  to a boil and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Heat
  remaining oil in a large skillet.  Add the fresh mushrooms and salt and
  saute over medium until mushroom liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes.
  Add mushrooms to the soup kettle and simmer for 30 minutes. Adjust
  seasoning if necessary.
  
  SERVING:  Ladle soup into warm bowls.  Sprinkle with parsley and ground
  black pepper.  Serve immediately.

           Karen Mintzias                     24    Cabbage leaves
      1 lg Onion; finely chopped                    Salted water
      1 tb Olive oil                           1 tb Butter
      1 kg Ground beef or lamb                 2 c  Hot stock or water
    1/3 c  Short grain rice                         Salt
      1    Tomato; peeled and chopped          1 tb Cornflour
      2 tb Chopped parsley                     2    Eggs; separated
      1 ts Chopped dill or mint                1    Lemon (juice only)
    1/8 ts Ground cinnamon                          Chopped dill or parsley
           Freshly ground black pepper    
 
  Serves: 6 Cooking time: 1 1/2 hours
  
  Gently fry onion in oil until soft.  Mix into meat with rice, tomato, herbs
  and cinnamon, seasoning to taste with salt and pepper.  Divide into 24
  portions.
  
  Blanch cabbage leaves in boiling, salted water for 5 minutes until
  softened. Drain and cut out thick centre of larger leaves (very large
  leaves may be cut in half).  Place one portion of stuffing on base of leaf,
  turn up base, fold in sides and wrap firmly into a neat roll. Repeat with
  remaining ingredients.
  
  Place rolls close together, seam sides down, in a deep pan lined with
  trimmings from cabbage leaves.  Add stock or water, butter, salt and pepper
  to taste.  Invert a heavy plate on top of rolls and cover pan tightly.
  Simmer gently for 1 1/2 hours.
  
  When cooked, drain off stock carefully into a small saucepan.  Reduce to 1
  1 1/2 cups over heat and thicken with cornflour mixed to a paste with a
  little cold water.  Let it boil 1 minute.
  
  Beat egg whites in a bowl until stiff, add yolks and beat thoroughly.
  Gradually beat in lemon juice, then boiling stock.  Return sauce to small
  pan, place over low heat and stir constantly until egg is cooked - do not
  boil.
  
  Arrange rolls on a heated serving dish and spoon some of the sauce over
  them.  Garnish with chopped dill or parsley and serve remaining sauce
  separately.   Serve with mashed potatoes.
  
  Note:  Grape vine leaves may be used instead of cabbage - about 40 will be
  required since they take less filling.

           -(thickly cut)                           Freshly ground black pepper
    1/4 c  Butter or corn oil                  4 c  Boiling water or stock
      1 lg Onion; finely chopped                    -(more if necessary)
      1 c  Tomato puree                        2 c  Orzo or kritharaki
      1 c  Chopped, peeled tomatoes          1/4 c  Grated kefalotiri cheese
      3    Cloves                            1/2 c  Diced haloumy or feta cheese
 
  Oven temperature: 180C (350F) Cooking time: 2 hours
  
  Have meat retailer cut chops about 4 cm (1-1/4 inches) thick. Alternatively
  purchace a leg of lamb and have it cut into 6 pieces.
  
  Place lamb in a baking dish and spread or pour oil or butter on top.  Bake
  in a moderate oven for 20 minutes.
  
  Add onion to dish and return to oven for further 10 minutes.  Add tomato
  puree, chopped tomatoes, cloves, cinnamon bark and salt and pepper to
  taste.  Baste meat with liquid and cook for futher hour until meat is
  tender, adding a little of the water or stock if necessary.
  
  When meat is cooked add water or stock and stir in pasta.  Cook for futhre
  20 minutes, stirring occasionally, and adding a little more liquid if
  mixture looks dry.  When pasta is tender, sprinkle cheese over pasta and
  return to oven for 5 minutes.  Serve immediately.
  
  NOTE: This is a popular restaurant dish in Greece, Cyprus and Egypt.  The
  pieces of meat are placed in individual casserole dishes after the initial
  cooking, and the sauce, pasta and water or stock added to each dish, then
  cooking completed.  In the home I suggest dividing the meat and pasta ater
  it is cooked and just before adding the cheese.  Return to oven for cheese
  to melt.

      Title: Yutangza (Steamed Cilantro Buns)
 Categories: Breads, Russian
      Yield: 16 servings
 
      1 pk Yeast, dry                        1/2 ts Salt
      2 ts Sugar                               8 tb Butter, sweet
    1/2 c  ;Water, lukewarm                    3 c  Flour, unbleached
    1/2 c  Milk                                1 c  Cilantro, fresh; finely chop
 
                                         Approx. Cook Time:  2:30 In a large
  bowl, combine the yeast, sugar, and water and let proof. Stir in the milk,
  salt, and two tablespoons of the butter and mix well with a wooden spoon.
  Stir in three cups of the flour, one cup at a time, stirring well after
  each addition.  Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead until
  smooth and elastic, about eight minutes, adding enough of the remaining
  flour to prevent sticking. Shape the dough into a ball. Place in a buttered
  bowl and turn to coat. Cover with a tea towel and let rise in a warm,
  draft-free place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch the dough
  down and knead briefly. Divide into sixteen parts and shape each into a
  ball. On a floured surface with a floured rolling pin, roll out one ball to
  a round about 1/16" thick.  Brush generously with melted butter and
  sprinkle all over with cilantro.  Fold in the edges of the round so they
  meet in the center and roll into a smooth bun between the palms of your
  hands.  Repeat with the remaining balls of dough.
  Place the buns on a buttered baking sheet, brush lightly with melted
  butter, and let them rise, covered, for about 20 minutes. In a bamboo or
  metal steamer set over simmering water, steam as many buns as will fit

      Title: Yuvarelakia Soupa Avgolemono (Meat-Rice "Barrel" Soup)
 Categories: Greek, Soups/stews, Rice/grains, Veal
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                           Salt & freshly ground pepper
      1 lb Ground beef, veal or lamb           3    Eggs
      1    Onion; grated                       5 c  Water or stock
      2    Garlic cloves; crushed (opt)        1    Onion (optional); chopped
      6 tb Raw long-grain white rice           1    Celery stalk (opt.); chopped
           Chopped fresh parsley             1/2    Carrot (optional); chopped
      2 tb Chopped dill, mint or basil         1    Lemon (or more), juice only
      1 ts Dried oregano or thyme         
 
  In a large bowl, combine the meat, grated onion, garlic, rice, 3
  tablespoons chopped parsley, the mint, oregano, salt and pepper, and 1 egg,
  slightly beaten. Knead for a few minutes, then shape into walnut- sized
  barrels and set aside.
  
  In a soup pot, bring the water or stock to boil with the chopped onion,
  celery and carrot, and salt and pepper to taste. Lower the heat and add the
  meat-rice barrels. Simmer, covered, for 30 minutes, then remove from the
  heat.
  
  To prepare avgolemono, beat the two remaining eggs for 2 minutes.
  Continuing to beat, gradually add the lemon juice. Then add 1 cup of the
  hot broth by droplets, beating steadily, until all has been added. Add to
  the soup and heat, being careful not to let it boil.  Serve hot, garnished
  with parsley.
  
  Note: This soup is frequently made without the additional vegetables added
  to the liquid.  Also, you may enjoy this soup without avgolemono, in which
  case add 1/2 cup canned tomato sauce to the liquid and reduce the water to
  4 1/2 cups.

           Karen Mintzias                      1    Cinnamon stick
      2 tb Vegetable oil or margarine          2 tb Tomato paste
      1 lb Lean meat, ground                   1 c  -Hot water

      Title: Zabaione Marsala
 Categories: Italian, Desserts
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Egg yolks                                - such as Florio or
    1/3 c  Sugar                                    - Pellegrino
    1/2 c  Sweet Sicilian Marsala                   Cinnamon
 
  Try substituting other wines (or liqueurs) for the Marsala; a combination
  of strong coffee and brandy also makes a flavorful, though not traditional,
  Zabaione.
  
  BRING A QUART OF WATER to a simmer in a small saucepan. Place the egg yolks
  in a heat-proof bowl and whisk by hand until liquid. Whisk in the sugar in
  a stream, then the Marsala. Regulate the heat under the pan so that the
  water simmers gently, then place the bowl over the pan so that the bottom
  of the bowl is above the surface of the water. Whisk vigorously; the
  Zabaione will begin to absorb air fairly quickly. Continue whisking for a
  total of 4 minutes, until the Zabaione is very aerated and thickened. Pour
  into stemmed glasses, dust with a dash of cinnamon and serve immediately.
  Though not traditional, you may wish to serve the Zabaione cool: After
  whisking until thickened, continue whisking by hand, with a hand mixer set
  at medium speed, or in a heavy-duty mixer fitted with the whip, until the
  Zabaione is cool.

      Title: Zeppoli
 Categories: Desserts, Italian
      Yield: 20 servings
 
      2 tb Butter                              1    Egg yolk
      1 pn Salt                                     Vegetable oil
      1 c  Flour                                    - for deep frying
      3    Eggs, whole                       1/2 c  Confectioners' sugar
 
  As made in Naples for the Feast of San Giuseppe, these crullers are piped
  from a pastry bag into ring shapes. After being fried, their centers are
  filled with pastry cream and cherry preserves.
  
  PUT BUTTER AND SALT into a saucepan with 1 cup water. Boil until butter
  dissolves. Off heat, dump in flour all at once and stir rapidly to mix.
  Return pan to medium-high heat and cook, still stirring rapidly, until
  mixture is smooth and begins to coat bottom and sides of pan. Remove pan
  from heat and, one at a time, add eggs and extra yolk, stirring briskly
  until each addition is absorbed. Let mixture cool to room temperature. Put
  confectioners' sugar into a brown paper bag. Heat deep-frying oil to 375F.
  Using 2 teaspoons, drop in nuggets of dough about the size of a small
  walnut. Fry a few at a time for 5-to-6 minutes each. As they cook, the
  zeppoli will rise to the surface, turn over when their bottom halves are
  golden brown, and finally rupture slightly and puff further as the interior
  dough expands. Remove them from the oil when golden brown, firm, and hollow
  inside. (Check one from the first batch, and if the interior is at all
  soggy, cook the rest longer.) Drain zeppoli briefly on paper towels, then
  toss in the bag with confectioners' sugar. Serve at once.

  finds collard greens an excellent substitute.
  
  Finely shred the greens, discarding tough stems. Place in a saucepan with
  the water. Bring to boil and cook, stirring occasionally, just until greens
  are crunchy-tender (don't overcook). Drain greens, reserving liquid. Return
  greens to medium heat; add tomato and onions. Heat through, stirring
  frequently.
  
  Thin peanut butter with 3/4 cup of the reserved cooking liquid, then add to
  vegetables. Heat, stirring constantly, until greens have a creamy
  consistency, adding more reserved liquid if mixture seems too thick. Taste,
  and add salt if needed.
  
  Serves 4.

      Title: Zucchini Blossoms, Cretan Style
 Categories: Greek, Appetizers, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Karen Mintzias                    1/2 c  Canned tomatoes; drained
     30    Zucchini blossoms                   3 tb Chopped parsley
      3 tb Olive oil                           3 tb Chopped fresh mint or dill
      4    Scallions, minced                        Salt & freshly ground pepper
      1    Garlic clove; minced              1/2 ts Granulated sugar
    1/3 c  Raw long grain rice            
 
  Soak the stems in cold water overnight, without soaking the blossoms.  The
  following day, wash and drain on a towel.  Cut off and discard the stems
  without breaking the blossoms, and set the blossoms aside while you make
  the filling.  Heat the oil and saute' the scallions until soft.  Add the
  garlic and rice and cook over moderate heat for 2 minutes stirring
  constantly with a wooden spoon.  Stir in the tomatoes, herbs, and enough
  water to cover the rice, then season with salt and pepper and the sugar.
  Simmer for 5 minutes, and remove from the heat.  Using a teaspoon, stuff
  each blossom carefully, holding it in the palm of one hand, then close it
  and lay it on its side in a buttered flameproof casserole large enough to
  accomodate all the blossoms.  Continue until all are filled.  Pour 1 cup of
  warm water into the casserole.  Invert a plate over the flowers, then cover
  the casserole and simmer over lowest heat about 1-1/2 hours.  Check every
  30 minutes to see if more water is needed; if so, add warm water (it should
  all be absorbed when cooked).  Serve with poultry, meat or fish dishes, or
  as a delightful first course.  From: "The Food of Greece" by Vilma

    1/2 c  Grated Parmesan                
 
  Pizza toppings: mushrooms, Mozzarella, etc.
  
  Grate zucchini and sprinkle with salt.  Let stand for 30 minutes. Squeeze
  out water from zucchini.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9x13 pan.
  
  Combine zucchini, eggs, flour, Parmesan cheese, oregano and a few grinds of
  pepper. Spread mixture onto pan.  Bake 25-30 minutes or until firm and dry.
  Brush with oil and broil until lightly browned. Spread with tomato sauce.
  Add mushrooms and Mozzarella cheese on top. Broil again until Mozzarella is
  melted and bubbly.
  
  Notes:  Can also be made in a jelly roll pan I prefer just mushrooms on
  top, too many extras don't enhance IMHO You could probably use a mixture of
  Romano and Parmesean...

      1 c  White Wine, Dry                       ts White Pepper
    1/4 c  All-Purpose Flour                 1/2 ts Tabasco
      1 ga Chicken Stock                       1 ts Extra Virgin Olive Oil
      1 md Potato, Peeled And Cut Up           2    Garlic Cloves, Sliced Very
      1 c  Whipping Cream                           - Thin, For Garnish
 
  1.  Cut two of the garlic heads in half across and remove the papery outer
  skin.  Put these cut side down on a very hot surface - a griddle or black
  iron skillet - until they're black.  Peel all the garlic completely. 2.
  Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan and saute the onions, celery, and
  the garlic until lightly browned at the edges.  Add the wine and bring to a
  boil. 3. Sprinkle in the flour and stir the pot thoroughly, but don't let
  it brown.  Add the chicken stock, 1/2 gallon water, and the potato. Whisk
  about the pot well and bring to a boil.  Reduce to a rapid simmer and cook
  for about an hour and 15 minutes. 4. Strain out the solids from the soup,
  and puree them in a blender or food processor, along with enough broth to
  ease things along. Return the puree to the soup and restore the boil. Add
  the whipping cream, basil, thyme, salt, pepper and Tabasco. 5. Heat the
  extra virgin olive oil in a skillet very hot.  In it toast the slivers of
  garlic until brown around the outside. 6 Ladle the soup into bowls and
  garnish with roasted garlic slivers. Float a toasted, garlic-buttered slice
  of French bread on top. Serves eight to twelve. Suggested wine: Marinasco
  Chef Andrea Apuzzo writes of this recipe in his book "La Cucina di
  Andrea's", "Garlic wears many hats. Most people think of it in its
  aggressive, green, aromatic, sharp form. But when garlic is cooked slowly
  for a long time, it takes on a sweet nuttiness that is every bit as
  interesting as its more raw flavors. The sweet side of garlic is
  exemplified by this soup." Andrea's Restaurant 3100 Nineteenth Street

  flavour. When using other juices, I always add the juice of a couple of
  lemons or limes. This recipe makes a concentrate that can be diluted with
  plain or sparkling water."
  
  Pour the boiling water over the grated ginger root, sugar, cloves and
  cinnamon in a large nonreactive pot or bowl (enamel, glass or stainless
  steel). Cover and set aside in a warm place, in the sun if possible , for
  at least an hour. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve or cloth. Add the
  juices and water. Set aside in a warm place for another hour or so. Gently
  strain the liquid again, taking care not to disturb the sediment at the
  bottom. Store in the refrigerator in a large nonreactive container. A glass
  gallon jar or jug works well. Serve warm, chilled or on ice, either as is
  or diluted with water or sparkling water. A squeeze of fresh lime juice in
  each glass of ginger drink is "the cat's meow".

      Title: Grenadine (Pomegranate Syrup)
 Categories: Beverages, Fruits, Syrups
      Yield: 2 cups
 
      2    Pomegranates, medium-large*       1/2 c  ;Water
  2 1/2 c  Sugar                          
 
  *When choosing pomegranates, reject any with a brownish area on the blossom
  end; such discoloration indicates the beginning of spoilage and off-flavor.
  
  Cut pomegranates open crosswise and pry out the fleshy crimson seeds (the
  red part is actually the pulpy envelope around a seed), using the tip of a
  blunt knife.  Be careful not to include any fragments of the cottony white
  pulp in which the seeds are embedded, as it is bitter. You should have
  about two cups of seeds.
  
  Using a food processor or blender, chop the seeds with the sugar and water
  just long enough to make a rough puree.  Don't attempt to make a smooth
  mixture; it's necessary only to break open the pulpy membranes.
  
  Pour the puree into an earthenware or glass bowl; cover it with a cloth.
  Let stand at room temperature for 3 days, stirring it daily. If the weather
  is extremely hot, refrigerate the puree after 24 hours.
  
  Line a sieve with dampened, very fine nylon net or two layers of dampened
  fine cheesecloth and set it over a saucepan of stainless-steel or other
  nonreactive material.  Filter the pomegranate syrup into the pot, allowing
  it to drip without pressing on the pulp. This will take a few hours; you
  can speed matters up by tying the cheesecloth lining of the sieve into a
  bag and suspending it above the pot after the initial flow of juice has
  slowed down. When all the juice has dripped through, discard the seedy
  pulp.
  
  Bring the syrup to a bare simmer (180 F) over medium-low heat, then reduce
  the heat to very low and scald the syrup, using a candy/jelly thermometer
  and watching to be sure you keep the temperature below 200 F, for 3
  minutes.
  
  Skim off any foam, then funnel the syrup into a sterilized, dry bottle. Let
  the syrup cool, then cap or cork the bottle (use a new cork only) and store
  it in the refrigerator.
  
  To seal the syrup for pantry storage, funnel it into hot, clean half-pint
  canning jars.  Seal with new two-piece canning lids according to
  manufacturer's directions.  Following the method for a boiling-water bath,
  but keeping the water at simmering temperature (190 F), process the jars
  for 15 minutes.  Cool, label, and store.
  
  Yield: About 2 cups.  Keeps in either the refrigerator or, after canning,
  in the pantry for at least a year.
  
  The author writes: "Delicate in flavor and ruby-red in color, pomegranate
  syrup is a supporting player rather than a star.  As such, it is much used
  as a flavor-smoother and sweetener in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic
  drinks; and it's also a pleasant topping for tart pineapple, peach or
  nectarine ice cream or sherbet...You might like to taste the real thing: a
  lot of the 'grenadine' offered nowadays is compounded of sweetening plus
  anonymous 'fruit' flavors rather than pomegranate juice."

 Categories: Beverages, Londontowne

      6    Apples, baking; cored             1/8 ts Nutmeg
      2 tb Sugar, brown; up to 1/2 cup       1/4 ts Cinnamon
      2 qt Cider, sweet; or hard cider       1/4 ts Ginger; ground
           -or a mixture of cider & ale   
 
  "The Feast of Epiphany, also called the Feast of Kings, Twelfth Night, or
  the last day of Christmas originated in Egypt during the course of the
  third century. Thus it was a more day than Christmas Day itself. Like
  Christmas, it was apparently established to compete with a pagan festival ,
  in honor of the Egyptian sun god, celebrated at the winter solstice... In
  England, Twelfth Night was traditionally celebrated with a delicious drink
  called Lamb's Wool, made of cider or ale, with roasted apples and sugar and
  spices. It was the custom to bless apple trees by pouring a libation of
  cider on them."
  
  "This Old English and Irish punch which dates from the Middle Ages,
  probably gets its name from the whiteness of the roasted apples as they
  float in the cider."
  
  Roast the apples in a baking pan at 450F for about an hour, or until they
  are very soft and begin to burst. (An alternative - and quicker- procedure
  is to peel and boil the apples until they are very soft and flaky.) You may
  leave the apples whole, or break them up.
  
  In a large saucepan, dissolve the sugar a few tablespoons at a time in the
  cider or ale , tasting for sweetness. Add the spices. Bring to a boil and
  simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Pour the liquid over the apples in a large
  punch bowl, or serve in a large heat resistant mugs.
  
  MAKES: 8 1 cup servings Note: Nuts make a nice accompaniment to Lamb's Wool
  (they were originally roasted in with the apples.)

       Combine water and milk in a deep pan, and bring to a boil. Add the
  spices and sugar. Stir to blend, and turn off the heat. Cover the pan, and
  let the spices soak for at least 10 minutes.
       Add the tea leaves or tea bags, and bring the water to a second boil.
  Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 5 minutes. Uncover, check the color
  and taste, and if desired add more milk and sugar. Strain the tea into a
  warm teapot, and serve immediately.
  
  Note: This is the way traditional spiced tea is made. You may, however,
  omit the milk or sugar, or both, in which case reduce the quantity of tea
  to 2 heaping teaspoons or 3 tea bags.

 Categories: Beverages, Fruits
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Canteloupe melon                    1 tb Sugar, instant dissolving;
    1/2 c  -Cold water                              -fruit/berry sugar -OR-
      2 tb Lime juice                               -icing sugar
 
  If using fruits with seeds, remove the seeds first; other fruits may be
  combined in the blender, poured over ice and enjoyed. Some of the most
  delicious frescos are made with mulberry, soursop, papaya and starfruit,
  but they can also be made with peaches or strawberries - or with home grown
  canteloupe. After pureeing, you can adjust the sweetness to taste.
  
  Peel and seed melon, chop coarsely. In blender, puree melon, water, lime
  juice and sugar until frothy and smooth. Divide among 4 glasses, adding ice
  if desired. Serve immediately.

  The original recipe calls for hibiscus flowers and suggested strawberries
  as a substitute. I have reversed the order. As well, I don't think it is
  necessary to use distilled water in most locations.
  
  In medium saucepan, combine 2 1/2 cups water, sugar and hibiscus flowers
  (or hulled strawberries). Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar.
  Reduce heat. Simmer 5 minutes to extract pink to extract pink from flowers.
  Remove from heat. Stir in lavender leaves. Cover and cool. Strain cooled
  herb liquid into large pitcher or jar (if using strawberries, gently press
  juice from berries.) Add remaining 2 1/2 cups water and lemon juice. Stir
  well. Add 1/2 cup more sugar, if desired. Just before serving, add ice
  cubes. Pour into chilled glasses.Garnish with lavender flowers. YIELD: 6-8

      1 oz Burdock Root, dried

  old-fashioned root beer, due to the sassafras.  It has a cleansing,
  revivifying effect from the dandelion, burdock and sarsaparilla.
  
  Mix together all ingredients and store in a tightly closed container. In a
  large pot combine 1 quart of water and 4 tablespoons of dry mixture. Bring
  to a boil, cover and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Strain and sweeten with
  honey or stevia (also called "sweet herb") if desired.
  
  Makes about 4 cups
  
  Variation:  For iced tea, chill the simmered mixture, then dilute it with 1
  quart of sparkling water.  Serve over ice with a twist of orange peel.

  above. Will keep up to three days refrigerated and indefinetely, if frozen.

      2 ts Salt                                1 ts Dry mustard
  1 1/2 ts White pepper                        1 ts Ground cayenne pepper
      1 ts Garlic powder                     1/2 ts Black pepper

------------------------------RICE INGREDIENTS------------------------------
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil                       4 tb Unsalted butter
      1 c  Chopped onions                  1 1/2 c  Uncooked rice (converted)
      1 c  Chopped green bell peppers          3 c  Pork, beef or chicken stock
    1/2 c  Pecan halves, dry roasted           2 c  Chopped unpeeled apples
    1/2 c  Raisins                        
 
  Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
     In a 2-quart saucepan, heat the oil over high heat until very hot, about
  2 minutes.  Add the onions and bell peppers; saute about 2 minutes,
  stirring occasionally. Add the pecans (we ran out of pecans, so Lucy
  substituted hickory nuts - good!) and continue cooking for about 3 minutes,
  stirring occasionally. Add the raisins and butter (these are added together
  so the raisins will absorb as much butter as possible). Stir until butter
  is melted, then cook until raisins are plump, about 4 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.  Add the rice and seasoning mix and cook until rice starts
  looking frizzly (a bit like ce Krispies) Chef Prudhomme recommended using
  converted rice. Lucy used brown, long grain rice - super!. This will
  require about 2 to 3 minutes, stirring almost constantly before the rice
  looks "frizzly". Stir in the stock, scraping pan bottom well, then stir in
  the apples. Cover pan and bring to boil; lower heat and simmer covered for
  5 minutes.  Remove from heat and let sit, *COVERED*, until rice is tender
  and stock is absorbed, about 30 minutes. (We cook the rice this slow way to
  let the flavors build to their maximum.)
    Serve immediately, allowing about 3/4 cup per person. From Paul
  Prudhomme's "Louisiana Kitchen"

      Title: Frances Cook's Bread and Rolls
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 24 servings
 
    3/4 c  Milk                                1 ts Salt
      1    Fresh cake yeast                    1    Egg
    1/4 c  Sugar                           3 1/2 c  Flour
      3 tb Shortening                        1/4 c  Lukewarm water
 
  Scald milk and pour over sugar, shortening, & salt. Let it cool to lukewarm
  while softening yeast in a small bowl with the warm water. When soft, add
  the egg and beat together slightly. Pour the yeast/egg mixture into the
  milk mixture and stir them together.
  The flour may be sifted or poured into the liquid. With a large spoon, stir
  until flour/milk is well mixed. You should have a firm, but not stiff
  dough. Without removing it from the bowl, cover the dough with a plate or
  towel and set aside to rise until double in bulk (about 2 hrs depending on
  the temperature in the kitchen). Instead of letting the dough rise at this
  point you may put it in the refrigerator and use it later, or the next day.
  Watch to make sure it doesn't spill out of the bowl. If it starts to spill
  before you're ready to use it, punch it back down. Refrigerated dough is
  easier to handle but takes longer to rise.
  BREAD: If you want to make bread, dump the dough out of the bowl onto a
  floured surface and with more flour as needed to keep it from sticking,
  knead it until springy and easy to handle. This dough does not require a
  lot of kneading; only enough to make it easy to handle. For 2 medium size
  loaves cut the dough in half and knead/shape each into loaves and put into
  greased baking pans. Allow about 2 hours for the dough to double again.
  Bake in a 375 degree oven until lightly browned on top (if uncertain
  whether or not bread is done, tip out of pan and see if bottom is browned
  too).
  ROLLS: To make rolls, work and knead dough until springy and easily
  handled. Roll out with a rolling pin and cut with a biscuit cutter and fold
  over and place on a greased cookie sheet (Parkerhouse rolls), or break
  dough into small pieces, make into little balls and place 3 in each section
  of a greased muffin pan (Cloverleaf rolls).
  SWEET ROLLS: For Christmas bread or sweet rolls, roll out dough as for
  Parkerhouse rolls, except trying to make an oblong instead of a round.
  Spread it with raisins and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Dot with
  butter and roll as for a jelly roll. Slice and place on a greased pan or
  make into a circle and make slashes through the dough at intervals. Let
  rise and bake as for loaves. Top with an icing made of confectioners'
  sugar, melted butter, milk, and vanilla or rum flavoring and drizzle over
  the bread or rolls while hot. Decorate with nuts or fruits.
  If you want to make a whole wheat bread, use half white and half whole
  wheat flour, and use brown sugar instead of white. The amounts above will
  yield 1 large or 2 medium loaves of bread, or 2 dozen large rolls.

      Title: Ricotta Cheese Pie with Pine Nut Crust
 Categories: Desserts, Pies
      Yield: 1 servings
 
-----------------------------------CRUST-----------------------------------
    1/4 c  Butter unsalted                   1/2 c  Pine nuts
    3/4 c  Crumbs from amaretto cookies  

-------------------------------CHEESE FILLING-------------------------------
     15 oz Ricotta cheese                      2 tb Four
    1/2 c  Sugar                               2 ts Lemon peel
  1 1/2 c  Sour cream                          2    Eggs
 
  Berries, grapes, or orange garnish.
  
  To make crust, place melted butter in 9 inch pie plate. Stir in cookie
  crumbs and pine nuts until well blended. Press firmly against bottom and
  sides of dish to form crust. Heat until set.
  
  To make filling, combine ricotte cheese, sour cream, sugar, flour, lemon
  peel, and eggs in 8 cup glass measure. Heat until center is very warm to
  the touch, stirring every two minutes. (Microwave is easy). Mixture will be
  a little lumpy at this point but will cook into a smooth pie. Pour filling
  into crust, smoothing it evenly on top. Place pie on top of microwave proof
  cereal bowl and microwave on medium for 8 to 14 minutes or until almost set
  in center, rotating one quarter turn once or twice. Let stand directly on
  counter for 30 minutes.  Chill for 3 hours or overnight before serving.
  Garnish pie.  To test to see if done, touch the top 1 inch from the center
  with your finger. When top adheres to your finger, cheese cake underneath
  should appear to be moist but set, not gooey. Sides should begin to pull
  away from dish.

  layer.  See if you can get your butcher to give you pork that has about
  equal amounts of pork and fat. Plain lean pork will not taste as good.) Cut
  meat into one-inch cubes. Peel and thinly slice potatoes. Peel or wipe
  mushrooms, and slice if large. Grease a large ovenproof dish with some of
  the butter, and place a layer of sliced potatoes in the bottom. Add half
  the meat pieces, seasoned and sprinkled with rosemary. Layer with half the
  vegetables, plus another layer of potatoes.  Repeat, using all meat, veg
  and potatoes.  Pour stock over and dot potatoes with remaining butter.
  Cover and cook in a moderate oven, 325F, for 2 1/4 hours. Uncover for the

      1 qt Water                               1 tb Sugar
      1 c  Catsup                              1 ts Salt
      1 tb Flour                                    Pepper; to taste
      4 tb Cornstartch                              Water; to make thin cream
      1 tb Vinegar                        
 
  This is the recipe I promised to send. It is a bit of a task to prepare,
  but well worth the effort. The recipe was passed down for many generations
  in my husbands family who immigrated here from Russia (being Russian Jews)
  so, I have no idea why they called it 'German' meatballs, but a meatball by
  any other name...I guess! Put the garlic into a water glass and pour 2 T
  boiling water over it. Mash the garlic well, then add 2 T. more boiling
  water. Strain through a kitchen towel, saving the liquid only. Mix together
  all the ingredients, including garlic liquid then shape into balls about
  the size of a large egg. Roll the balls in the flour until well coated.
  Melt enough fat to make about 1/2" in a heavy skillet or cast iron cooking
  pot. Brown the meat balls in the fat. Remove the meatballs and pour off all
  but 4 T. of the fat. Ingredients: SAUCE: Add the qt. of water to the
  reserved fat along with thecatsup. Make a paste of the sauce ingredients,
  stirring in the water to get a consistency of a thin cream. After the
  water-catsup mixture is warm, slowly add this mixture, stirring constantly
  to avoid lumping, until the mixture has been well absorbed into the liquid.
  Cook gently until the sauce is slightly thickened. Place meatball in the
  pan, or in an oven-proof roaster and make sure they are covered with the
  sauce. Cover pan and bake in hot oven for 1 hour. Serve with mashed
  potatoes. (My friends also love it with pasta or rice!) Enjoy! Barb

  a co-workers trip to a restaurant on a vacation. I tried it for a Christmas
  brunch and must say it got rave reviews from many--others didn't care for
  it much.  It is unusual, and I liked it.  It is very colorful--and don't
  say "Yuk" until you've tried it! Thanks Fredi.

      Title: Spanish Tortilla
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3    Potatoes peeled & sliced            4 tb Olive oil
      4    Medium eggs                              Salt to taste
 
   In Spain, a tortilla is a peasant potato omlette. It is usually eaten at
  room temperature, and is standard picnic food. It's cooked in a medium
  sized sautee (or frying) pan and is round and solid; serve it sliced in
  pie-shaped pieces.
   Heat oil in pan, lower heat and sautee potatoes slowly until fairly soft.
  Turn and "slice" at them often with spoon or metal spatula. Scrape pan so
  nothing sticks. Lift cooked potatoes into bowl, add slightly beaten eggs
  and salt, mix lightly and return to pan (add a little oil if none remains).
  Cook slowly until bubbles start to appear on top, or it seems half-cooked.
  Loosen from pan with spatula if necessary. Place a plate on top, turn
  tortilla over on to pan, then slide it off into pan to cook on other side.
  Should be solid when fin- ished. Remove from pan the same way. (Experts
  flip the tortilla to turn it - I have never had the nerve to even TRY
  this!). Makes a good side dish, light supper, or picnic dish. FROM: HEATHER

           Pizza dough of choice                    Garlic powder
    1/2    Stick margerine                          Parmesean Cheese
 
  After making the dough for your pizza you place it on a piece of heavy duty
  aluminium foil. Spread it into a circular pizza shape. Take your pizza
  cutter and score the dough into 1/2" slices and then cut the entire pie in
  half.  Melt a 1/2 stick of margerine and add 1/2 teaspoon of garlic
  powder(add more or less to suit you). Spread this on your bread sticks. Top
  the bread with parmesean cheese and place aluminum foil directly on oven
  rack-no pan needed-at 450 degrees until crispy and browned. I always make
  an extra crust when making pizza for my family. After eating the bread
  sticks no one wants much pizza. I hope you like it. Mary in Memphis

      1 c  Water; boiling                    1/2 c  Oats
  2 1/2 tb Margarine                           1    Egg, extra large, lightly be
  1 1/2 ts Salt                                3 c  Bread flour
      3 tb Honey                               2 ts Yeast, sprinkled over flour
      1 tb Molasses, dark, unsulphured    
 
  Insert pan in BM and close lid. Select "Basic White Bread" setting and
  medium baking degree setting. This is a very large loaf. On my Hitachi, it
  hit the top of the lid while rising but it baked just fine. I found,
  however, that I needed to use the "light" setting.

-----------------------------------DOUGH-----------------------------------
      3 c  Flour; sifted                            Vegetable oil,
    1/2 ts Salt,                               1    Egg yolk;  mixed with
      1 c  Water,                              1 tb Water
      1    Egg; slightly beaten,         

-------------------------------POTATO FILLING-------------------------------
      4 c  Potato; cooked, mashed              3 c  Onion; chop  fine
    1/3 c  Vegetable oil                            Salt & pepper; to taste
 
  Saute onion in oil until tender and lightly browned and them mix with pota-
  toes, salt & pepper. Adjust seasoning. ASSEMBLY Measure flour, baking
  powder & salt in large bowl. Add water, egg & 1 Tblsp-->oil. Stir until
  dough holds together.  Put on a lightly floured surface & knead until
  smooth and elastic, using only enough extra flour to keep dough from
  sticking-this takes about 5 minutes.  Put dough on lightly floured board,
  cover w/large bowl and let sit for 1/2 hour. Divide dough into 4 pcs. Roll
  out each piece into a 12" square on a lightly floured sur- face. Cut in
  half to make two 6"  wide strips. Brush lightly with---> oil. Spoon 1/8 of
  the filling down the center of each strip (the long way) Fold 1 long side
  over the filling  & roll to the other side.  This will make a long roll.
  Pinch edges together. Repeat with rest of dough & filling. Put rolls on
  lightly oiled cooky sheets with the seam side down. Score with the blunt
  edge of a knife at 1-1/2"  intervals,  do
    not cut through.  Brush with egg yolk mixture & bake
    in a preheated  375 ----> oven for 30 minutes,  or until golden brown.
  Remove  from oven & cut all the way through where scored. If you are
  freezing these, allow to cool to room temperature, place on cookie sheet &
  put in freezer un- til frozen. Wrap well in plastic, over wrap with
  aluminum foil & return to freezer. To reheat, preheat oven to 375 degrees
  and
    bake for 15-20  minutes, or until hot. Hope you enjoy these! Susan, NJ

      Title: Rare Prime Rib
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 16 servings
 
     12 lb Prime rib roast                          Black pepper to taste
           Salt to taste                  
 
  Remove roast from the refrigerator ast least two hours before beginning to
  cook. Place in a shallow roasting pan and liberally sprinkle fatty top with
  salt and pepper. Pat in. To protect the oven from spattering fat, place a
  tent of aluminum foil loosely over the top of the meat. Preheat the oven to
  500*F and when preheated place roast in oven and roast for the times listed
  below. THE TIMES MUST ABE ADHERED TO EXACTLY. Set a timer to remind you as
  a few minutes of overcooking will ruin the roast. When the cooking time
  ends, turn off the oven but DO NOT open the door. Allow the roast to remain
  in the oven for at least 1 hour or until the oven is luke warm, which
  occurs in about 2 hours. The roast will be beautifully rare inside and
  retain a crunchy outside and an internal heat suitable for serving for 2
  hours. The roasting time works out to 15 minutes per rib or approximately 5
  minutes per pound. NOTES:  1. For a 2 rib roast weighing 41/2 -5 lbs. allow
  25 to 30 minutes at 500*F
        2. For a 3 rib roast weighing 8-9 lbs. allow 40-45 minutes at 500*F
        3. For a 4 rib roast weighing 11-12 lbs. allow 55-60 minutes at 500*F
        4. Have your butcher prepare the roast by removing the chine bone and
  cutting the meat from the bones. Then return the chine bone and the meat to
  its original shape and tie the roast to hold it together. This will
  facilitate your carving.
        5. A small end Prime rib is always the best.

      1    Instant Lemon pudding                    Poppyseed

  *(I use Betty Crocker Supermoist) Beat all ingredients, except poppyseed,
  until smooth.
   Add poppyseed to your taste.  I usually add about 2 Tablespoons but you
  can add as much as you like.  I then bake it in a well greased bundt pan
  for about 40 minutes at 350 degrees or until a toothpick comes out clean.
  If you were using small bread pans you would cut the baking time down
  depending on the size of your pans. It makes great muffins too.

      Title: Sugar Cured Ham
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 pt Jefferson Island Salt or can        1 tb Ground red pepper
      2 tb Black pepper                   
 
  We raise hogs and salt or sugar cure our hams and bacon. You will need
  FRESH hams, preferably from a salughter house as these are fresher than
  those available at grocery stores. You will need the above ingredients FOR
  EACH JOINT (local name for ham or shoulder.) To cure two hams, double the
  ingredients. Mix all above and rub well into meat, filling hole in end of
  the bone.  Wrap in brown paper and place in a cloth sack. Hang hock (small
  end) down. Time will cure it. Additional details: Should be hung in a cool
  (around 40 degrees) place.  That's why before refrigeration hogs were only
  killed in the winter.
    If you are curing without refrigeration, try to do it when the
  temperature will remain from 35 to 50 degrees for at least the first three
  days. After that it's okay if it goes up or down more. You can hang the
  meat in an old refrigerator to cure it or if you are curing outside and the
  temp goes haywire, you can move it to the refrig. Needless to day, if you
  are hanging the meat in an out building or garage, hang it high enough to
  keep it out of the reach of dogs.  They do love fresh ham. The ham should
  hang for at least 6 month (I prefer a year) before being cut. If you want
  to smoke the ham, it is best to wait about three months from hanging before
  doing it.
     Be aware that you may loose a ham.  By that I do not mean that someone
  will steal it, though, I suppose that is possible. I mean that it may ruin.
  That's one of the chances you take. We've lost a few but most of them have
  been salted down rather than sugar cured. It is possible to sugar cure
  bacon in your refrigerator using Morton Sugar Cure (using recipe on bag)
  and then smoke it. It's GREAT! Much better than what you buy in the store.
  Yes, I can just hear all the health food people groaning at all this talk
  of ham and bacon and smoke. Ah, cholesteral (sp?) and salt and cancer
  causing smoke! May not be good for you but 99.9% of all taste buds will
  vote for it!

      Title: Aioli
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      6    Cloves of garlic, peeled            1    Juice of a lemon
    1/2 c  Pine nuts                         1/4 c  Olive oil
      3    Potatoes, boiled, peeled and        1    Egg, lightly beaten
 
     Combine the garlic and nuts in a blender or food processor and puree.
  Add the potatoes, and puree. Pour potato mixture into a bowl and, using a
  whisk, beat in the lemon juice, a bit at a time. Gradually add the olive
  oil in a thin stream while continuing to beat so oil combines with potato
  mixture. When oil has been absorbed, add the egg and beat well. Giovanni de
  Bourbon-Sicily, French Vogue Note: If you omit the raw egg, you still get a
  nice sauce. According to an ancient proverb, "Garlic is as good as 10
  mothers." If the latest flu bug has hit your house--and whose has
  escaped--you may be ready to test claims for garlic's medicinal powers.
     Since 1983, the National Library of Medicine has gathered 125 scientific
  papers on the therapeutic potential of garlic. They've found some
  interesting material. It's clear that allicin, the smelly compound in
  garlic, is an antibiotic--but only if taken raw. Heat destroys the elements
  that have antibiotic properties. Raw or cooked, garlic can also work as a
  decongestant and expectorant for common colds and bronchitis. Regularly
  eating raw garlic seems to act as a deterrent for these ailments, according
  to Dr Irwin Ziment. A Dr Abdullah, who eats a couple of raw garlic cloves a
  day, claims he has not had a cold since 1973. Admittedly, eating raw garlic
  won't help your social life but Kyolic, a deodorized garlic compound from
  Japan, may allow you to have good health and good friends. I've also heard
  of fresh garlic imported from Japan that supposedly is deodorized. If any
  of you have found it in local stores, let us know. It would be interesting
  to hear if it lives up to the claims made for it.
     Since having the flu is no fun, this may be a good time to take your
  chances and share some pungent garlic dishes with friends and family--for
  health's sake. It's easy to add minced fresh garlic to hummus or tabbouleh,
  Mid-Eastern dishes you can buy in many deli's and natural food stores. If
  you're brave, you can try my grandmother's cold cure. Spread a slice of
  black bread with butter, then layer thin slivers of raw garlic all over the
  bread. Eat this and it'll cure what ails you...or keep everyone so far away
  that no germs will reach you! Aioli is a milder way to enjoy raw garlic.
  This French condiment, a sort of mayonnaise, is a puree of garlic, boiled
  potatoes, olive oil and egg. Serve it with chicken, grilled fish, dolloped
  into soup and on vegetables.

      2 tb Red wine vinegar               
 
  ROAST THE PEANUTS IN A 325F oven until golden brown (about 10 minutes). Re-
  move and set aside. To make marinade, mix together rice wine, cornstarch
  and 1 teaspoon Asian sesame oil. In a bowl, toss the chicken with the
  marinade; set aside until ready to cook. In a small bowl, mix well soy
  sauce, vinegar, sugar and other teaspoon of sesame oil. Over medium heat,
  preheat wok until hot. Add oil, salt and dried red chiles; cook until
  chiles are charred (about 15 seconds). Add ginger and garlic; stir-fry
  until fragrant and lightly browned (about 30 seconds). Increase to high
  heat, add bell peppers and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add the chicken into
  the wok and stir-fry a minute or until the cubes feel firm to the touch and
  are opaque white in color. It should take no more than a total of 2
  minutes. Now stir in sauce mixture; toss and stir until it thickens into a
  glaze (about 30 seconds). Remove wok from heat. Add reserved roasted
  peanuts, fold together. Serve hot. Selden, here is my version of General
  Tso Chicken, which is also known as Kung Pao Chicken. When charring the
  chile peppers, be sure the ventilation is on and avoid breathing the strong
  chile fumes. The charring creates a desirable smoky flavor. Serves 4 to 6
  with other dishes. GUEST CHEF (EXPT46B)

      3    Garlic*                             1 c  All purpose flour**
      1 tb Cajun Spices,                  
 
  Preheat oven to 325 *large heads of (about 50 cloves) **or as needed As the
  coating hardens and bakes on the chicken, the flavors and juices are all
  sealed in.. Best chicken you ever ate. Put peeled garlic cloves in blender
  with 1/2 cup of olive oil and Cajun spices. Blend until creamy consistency,
  add more oil if needed. Place the oil and garlic mixture in a large bowl.
  Add flour slowly, mixing until a very heavy, thick, smooth mud like
  consistency is achieved. With string, tie the chicken wings and the legs
  tight against sides of carcass. Using a spatula, completely coat chicken
  with Garlic Mud, as evenly as possible, using it all. Fill in all crevices
  between wings and legs. Place on a rack, breast side up, in a pan and put
  in preheated oven. Roast whole chicken about 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours or until
  coating is browned well. If using cutup chicken, coat each piece very well,
  place on a rack and roast for a shorter time, until chicken coating is
  brown. Serve chicken with the crisp pieces of Garlic coating .. I would
  suggest using a vertical roaster. It is a wire stand that the chicken slips
  down on and is vertical. Set your bottom rack as low as possible to
  accommodate in oven. Even a lower heat setting with a longer roast time is
  even better.

  **(combine all marinade ingredients in a bowl) ***(combine all seasoning
  sauce ingredients in a cup) Thoroughly mix beef with marinade and marinate
  for 30 minutes.  Heat wok over highest heat, when hot, swirl in 2 Tblsp
  peanut oil.
   Add ginger and salt and toss a few seconds.  Add broccoli and stirfry one
  minute, then add water, turn heat to med-high, cover, and steam until crisp
  tender.
   Uncover and turn heat to high, stir frying until water is evaporated.
  Remove broccoli and reserve. Reheat same wok (without rinsing) and, when
  hot, add remaining peanut oil. Add beef slices and stirfry until lightly
  browned but not cooked through.  Do not stirfry too vigorously or meat will
  not brown, it is better to press slices against sides of wok to sear. Add
  broccoli to wok and toss.  When hot, stir in seasoning sauce and stir until
  sauce thickens (it's a good idea to whisk the sauce in the cup just before
  you hurl it into the wok). Turn onto a platter and drizzle sesame oil over
  the top. The sugar in the marinade and seasoning sauce acts as a floor
  enhancer rather than a sweetener. I hope you enjoy this recipe.

  DIRECTIONS This recipe is for 4 but can be cut in half for 2. I usually
  make the whole thing up so I can enjoy it the next day for lunch or as a
  side dish when completely mixed into the rice. I holds well in the fridge
  if covered tightly. Cut chicken into strips. Toss with 1 TBS soy and set
  aside.  Mix together remaining soy, chicken broth and cornstarch. Set
  aside. Heat 1 1/2 TBS oil in wok or large fry pan and quickly stir fry the
  drained chicken strips until browned. Be sure wok is hot.Remove from wok
  and keep warm. Add remaining oil to wok and stir fry all veggies over
  medium heat for 4-5 minutes. Add the broth mix, bring to a boil--stirring
  constantly. Return chicken to the wok, add the nuts and heat about one
  minute.  Serve immediately over white rice. Please try the sticky rice,
  folks. Once you d you will probably never go back to the minute again. The
  oil can be cut back if you desire without affecting the final results. BTW,
  is anyone out there reading the posts of those who are taking their time?
  How about joining in for some variety. I know would like some new ones such

      Title: Salt Cured Ham
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 pt Salt                                1    Ham

-------------------------------CURING PROCESS-------------------------------
 
  Okay, Gary,
     To salt down a ham you will again need a FRESH ham.
   If at all possible, find some Jefferson Island Salt.
   We have less trouble loosing hams when we use that.
   If not, use canning salt -- DO NOT USE IODIZED SALT.
     For each ham use two pints of salt.  Rub salt in well to all sides of
  ham, filling bone cavity.
        (cont) >>     I suppose that I should have told you prior to this
  that you have to have a salt box constructed of wood -- a very strong salt
  box.  It may have to withstand the assault of neighborhood dogs.
   Box should be large enough to hold hams in a single layer. (Ours is 3'x5'
  on the bottom and about 2' high.) Size doesn't matter much as long as hams
  don't butt up against each other and it's not so small that the dogs can
  move it.      On to curing:  You will have salt left after rubbing on hams.
  Place a thin layer of the salt in the bottom of the box. Place ham on this,
  skin side down.  Pour the >>> remaining salt on the ham. Place top on box
  and secure. Find a handy calendar and mark down three weeks. Okay, ham
  comes up then. Wash salt off ham and LIBERALLY coat with black pepper. (Use
  dust mask from workshop if pepper bothers you.) Place in cloth sack (old
  pillow case will do nicely) and hang. Do not cut for at least 6 months, 1
  year is better.
    All of this should be done when the temp is 35 to 50 degrees.
    Good luck.  No guarantees.  (Sugar cure is better!)

  ~-------------For the chicken:--------------------------------------------
  ~----------For the salad:------------ -----------For the
  dressing:---------- TO MAKE THE CHICKEN, cut up breasts & season the
  nuggets with salt and pepper. Place the flour on a sheet of wax paper, and
  beat the eggs with the milk in a shallow bowl. Place the breadcrumbs on
  another sheet of wax paper. Dip the chicken pieces in the flour, shaking to
  remove any excess, then dip them in the egg mixture, and then in the
  breadcrumbs. Allow them to sit for 10 minutes so the crumbs will adhere.
  Prepare salad ingredients, and arrange them on 6 individual plates or a
  serving platter. To make the dressing, combine the honey, mustard, vinegar,
  salt and pepper in a bowl. Whisk until smooth, and then slowly whisk in the
  oils. To serve, heat the oil in a deep-sided pan over medium-high heat to a
  temperature of 375F. Add the chicken pieces, being careful not to crowd the
  pan, and fry until golden brown, about 5 minutes. The frying will have to
  be done in batches. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain well
  on paper towels. Arrange the chicken pieces on top of the salads, and
  drizzle the dressing over all. Serves 6. Note: The salad is even quicker to
  make if you purchase the already-breaded chicken nuggets. You can buy
  nuggets already breaded in the poultry case or the freezer case.

      2 c  Vegetable oil                     1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 lb Mozzarella cheese, grated         1/4 ts Pepper
    1/4 lb Monterey Jack cheese, grated        1    Egg
      1 ts Minced garlic                       2 tb Milk
    1/2 ts Dried thyme                         1 c  Yellow cornmeal
    1/2 ts Dried oregano                       1 c  Mild or hot tomato salsa
 
    MAKE A SLIT WITH THE TIP of a paring knife in the pepper at the cap.
  Place the oil in a deep saucepan and heat to a temperature of 375F. Have a
  bowl of ice water handy. Fry the peppers a few at a time for about 1
  minute, or until the skin is blistered all over. Remove with tongs, and
  plunge into the ice water. Repeat until all peppers are fried. When cool
  enough to handle, gently rub off the skin. Cut a slit in one side of the
  pepper, and remove the seeds, keeping the pepper whole. Set aside,
  reserving the oil. In a bowl, mix together the mozzarella, Monterey Jack,
  garlic, thyme, oregano, cilantro, salt and pepper. Gently stuff the mixture
  into the peppers, securing them with toothpicks. Chill for 30 minutes. Beat
  the egg with the milk. Roll the peppers in the mixture, and then roll in
  cornmeal. Heat the reserved oil to 375F. Fry the peppers for about 3
  minutes, or until golden brown. As you fry, be careful not to crowd the
  pan. Remove the peppers from the pan with tongs, drain on paper towels, and
  repeat until all peppers are fried. Serve immediately, accompanied by
  salsa, if desired. Serves 6. Note: The peppers can be prepared up to the
  point of being dredged in cornmeal and fried up to two days in advance and
  refrigerated, tightly covered with plastic wrap. Dredge with cornmeal and
  fry just prior to serving.

      Title: How To Make Gravy
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 servings
 
 
  ~---------RIDE THE GRAVY TRAIN--------------------------------------
  chicken or a light wine sauce to nap a seared steak, the basis for easy and
  wonderful enrichments for sauteed, fried or roasted dishes is what's left
  sticking to the bottom of the pan. The process of turning a messy-looking
  skillet into an ethereal, richly flavored liquid in a matter of minutes is
  called deglazing. That's because the brown bits are caramelized meat juices
  that escaped while the food was cooking. They will meld with the liquid,
  and can then be augmented with anything from salt and pepper to fresh herbs
  and lemon zest. It not only makes a great sauce, it also renders the pan
  virtually clean. The only caveat is to brown the food without burning the
  juices. Even if you start with high heat to sear a piece of meat, reduce
  the heat to medium high so that the juices don't burn. This is especially
  important if you are cooking food in batches. The first round of beef cubes
  might be fine at high heat, but keeping the heat there will burn the brown
  bits as quickly as the tropical sun will scorch a fair-skinned person. The
  first step to deglazing is to degrease the pan. If you were pan- frying,
  pour the grease into a measuring cup, and see if any meat juices sink to
  the bottom. If there is a layer, carefully pour off the grease, reserving
  the liquid at the bottom to add to the sauce later. If the food was
  sauteed, there won't be enough juice to worry about, so just dispose of the
  fat. You now have a choice to make. Do you want to saute a chopped onion, a
  few shallots, or a clove or two of garlic as part of your sauce? If so, add
  some fresh butter or oil to the skillet and saute the vegetables over
  medium heat, stirring frequently. The moisture in the vegetables will start
  to coax the brown bits off the bottom of the pan. Then add whatever liquid
  you are using, with the pan over medium high heat. Your liquid can be
  stock, wine, fruit juice, water, cream or some combination. The basic
  amount for a deglazing sauce is 1/2-to-2/3 cup for a 10- or 12-inch
  skillet. Raise the heat to high and stir the liquid, scraping it all across
  the bottom of the pan to dislodge the brown bits. You want to boil the
  liquid down rapidly until it has reduced in volume by 1/2. It should have
  an almost syrupy consistency. When it has a syrupy consistency, lower the
  heat to low and taste the sauce for seasoning. You can stir in some fresh
  or dried herbs, a bit of salt, if needed, or a few grinds of pepper.

      Title: How To Handle Peppers
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 servings
 
---------------------------PEEL A PECK OF PEPPERS---------------------------
 
  Many recipes calling for peppers--sweet bell or fiery chilie--bury the
  elusive line "roasted, peeled, seeded and..." in the ingredient listed.
  There are many ways to accomplish this task. No caveats are necessary for
  sweet bell peppers, but exercise certain precautions in handling chilies
  containing potent oils. Old-fashioned cookbooks call for wearing rubber
  gloves when handling chilies. Instead, cut hot chilies on a plate that can
  be washed in the dishwasher, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water
  after handling them, and never touch your skin until you've washed your
  hands. And don't handle hot chilies under running water, since that spreads
  the oil vapors upward to your eyes. Achieving perfect peppers is a two-part
  process, heating and then cooling them, so the skin separates from the
  flesh. For recipes like pepper salad, in which the peppers should retain
  firmness, it is better to roast and chill them quickly. For recipes such as
  a sauce in which the pepper is pureed, more tender peppers are desirable.
  When roasting hot chilies, make a small slit at the stem since they
  occasionally explode. Here are ways to heat peppers: o For a large number
  of peppers, and to retain the most texture, lower peppers gently into 375F
  oil and fry until the skin blisters. Turn them with tongs when one side is
  blistered, since they will float on the surface. This method is also the
  most effective if peppers are not perfectly shaped, since it is difficult
  to get the heat from a broiler into the folds of peppers. Here are other
  ways to heat peppers: o Place the peppers 6 inches from the broiler element
  of the stove, turning them with tongs until all surfaces are charred. o
  Place the peppers 4 inches above a hot charcoal or gas grill, and turn them
  until the skin is charred. o Place a wire cake rack over a gas or electric
  burner. o Set the gas or electric burner at the highest temperature, and
  use tongs to turn the peppers on a wire cake rack until all surfaces are
  charred. o Place the peppers on a rack on a cookie sheet in a 550F oven
  until totally blistered. Only use this method for a sauce or other recipe
  in which the peppers are destined to be pureed. For cooling peppers, the
  options are not as plentiful: o Place them in ice water. This stops the
  cooking action immediately, and cools them enough to peel them within a
  minute. o The alternative is to wrap the peppers in a plastic bag and allow
  them to steam. This separates the flesh from the skin, but it will be 20
  minutes or more before they can be handled. If you wrap peppers in a
  plastic bag to cool, they will soften in the time it takes for them to cool
  enough to be handled. There are no choices to make for the final step: Pull
  the skin off and remove the seeds. The bell can now be rinsed under cold
  water. From Prodigy Cooking Class

    1/2 ts Salt                           
 
  THE BEST WAY TO PEEL these peppers is to fry them in oil and then plunge
  into ice water (see column). Carefully remove the skin, keeping the cap and
  flesh whole. Make a slit down one side, and carefully cut out the seeds.
  Rinse the peppers in cold water, and drain on paper towels. Heat the olive
  oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the shallots and garlic, and
  saute, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes. Scrape the mixture into a bowl
  and add the basil, thyme, rosemary, parsley, salt, pepper, goat cheese and
  mozzarella. Mix well, and form the mixture into 6 cylinders the same size
  as the peppers. Place one cylinder of the mixture in each pepper, skewer
  the peppers shut with toothpicks, and chill for 1 hour. Heat the oil to
  375F. Beat the egg with the milk, and dip the filled peppers. Roll in
  flour, and fry in the hot oil until brown, turning gently with tongs.
  Remove with tongs, drain on paper towels, and serve immediately,
  accompanied by salsa, if desired. NOTE: The peppers can be completed up to
  step 3 a day in advance and refrigerated, tightly covered with plastic
  wrap.

      Title: How To Stir Fry -  *P Cooking Class
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 servings
 
 
  ~----------WOK AROUND THE CLOCK------------------------------------- Spr
  spatulas toss food high into the air above the pot. Tie a tea towel around
  your head and make noises like a samurai warrior. You'll have your family
  or friends laughing hysterically, but chances are you won't be cooking
  effectively. Speed and control are the keys to a successful stir-fry. The
  ancient Chinese invented stir-frying as one of their more than 50 methods
  of food preparation. However, many recipes now use the technique for many
  non-Asian dishes. It's quick, requires little fat, and leaves food with a
  toothsome texture we enjoy today. While it's possible to adapt many recipes
  to stir-frying, oil rather than butter should be used. Dairy solids in
  butter burn at a very low temperature--about 250F--so it can only be added
  as a flavoring agent once food is cooked. Oil, on the other hand, doesn't
  begin to smoke until more than 400 degrees, so it's a better choice.
  Another key principle: Never place too much food in a wok or skillet at a
  time. Food must be able to be seared all over, without steaming from being
  buried under a layer of food. Stir-frying itself is a very quick process,
  so the food must be sitting in bowls or dishes placed within arm's reach,
  ready to be cooked. Cut all the pieces the same size, have your seasonings
  at hand, and make sure that any partial cooking of vegetables--such as
  blanching broccoli or carrots--is complete. If your grocery store has a
  salad bar, it can save a lot of preparation time. Go through the salad bar
  and measure out just the ingredients needed for a recipe. Place the wok or
  skillet over a high flame, and heat it very hot. Listen for the sound of
  sizzles. If a few drops of water evaporate immediately, the pan is ready.
  Add the required amount of oil to the pan, and swirl it around gently to
  coat all sides. At this point, it's time to add the food, and keep it
  moving in the pan. If stir-frying in a wok, use a wire mesh spoon designed
  for the job. If stir- frying in a skillet, use a spoon that will reach to
  all places on the bottom, and with which you can keep food moving. It's
  important to add ingredients in the order given, and stir constantly. In
  some recipes, liquid is added and the pan is covered for a brief time. In
  other recipes, it's fry and eat. Whatever the method--wok or skillet--you
  can stir-fry dinner in less time than it takes to watch a commercial on the
  evening news.

      Title: Biscuit Bonanza
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 servings
 
 
  ~----------BISCUIT BONANZA------------------------------------- In France,
  dessert is often constructed from towers of flaky puff pastry, and in the
  Middle East, paper-thin phyllo dough is either left crispy or made soggy
  with syrup. But the U.S. has biscuits to call its own. Biscuits--moist,
  tender and rich--are used as an alternative to a yeast-leavened bread.
  Biscuits are closer in technique to making pie crust than to making bread.
  The steps follow the same order: Cut the shortening into the flour mixture,
  add some liquid and roll it out. Once you've mastered the technique, you
  can not only delight in the aroma of biscuits browning for breakfast, you
  can also bake scones for a proper English tea. (The difference is there are
  eggs in scones and not in biscuits). Biscuits are similar to real
  shortcakes, rather than the hockey pucks made from cellulose sponges found
  next to the red glop in the produce department. And you can crown fresh
  fruit with a biscuit dough topping and call it a cobbler. Start by sifting
  the dry ingredients ~-flour, baking powder or soda, salt, sugar and so
  forth. Then cut in the butter or shortening until the mixture resembles a
  fine meal, like breadcrumbs. While a wire-blade pastry blender is useful,
  you can use two knives, pulse a food processor fitted with the steel blade
  on and off a few times, or use your fingertips. The third step is adding
  the liquid. The trick is to accomplish this quickly, so that the
  ingredients are just blended enough to hold together. It's tempting to do
  more, but that's what makes biscuits or their first cousins tough. Once
  liquid is added to flour the gluten formation begins, and any agitation
  intensifies this process. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface,
  such as a counter or a pastry board, and use the same restraint that went
  into adding the liquid. Don't knead it more than 10 times, just enough to
  give it a push in the oven, but not enough to make it chewy. Now either
  roll or pat the dough into the proper thickness. The dough should be less
  than 1 in thick. Cut it into desired shapes. No fancy cutters? Use juice
  cans (a 2 in diameter) or an upside down glass.

      Title: How To Fillet Fish - *P Cooking Class
 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 1 servings
 
 
  ~-------------SOLE FOOD--------------------------------------------
     The into steaks for grilling, or leave it whole for baking or poaching.
  But if confronted by a thin Dover sole when craving fish and chips, or a
  pudgy salmon when you want slivers of gravlax, it's good to know how to
  fillet the fish yourself. While both flatfish and roundfish can be
  filleted, they are approached differently. A flatfish is easy to spot; it
  looks as if it has been run over by some underworld tractor. Flatfish swim
  horizontally along the sea bottom, with both eyes facing upward. You can
  obtain four nearly equal fillets from a flatfish, one from either side of
  the backbone on both sides. To fillet a flatfish (sole, flounder, turbot,
  Pacific halibut): Peel it by laying it flat on a counter with the dark side
  up and the tail towards you. Slice off the tail, and insert the tip of a
  knife until you have a grip on the skin. Holding the tail in place, pull
  the skin back towards the head, over the head, and then down the light
  colored side. Lay the fish on the counter with its eyes facing up. Cut down
  the backbone along the center of the fish, then hold your knife at an angle
  at the head end of one fillet. Lift the fillet with one hand, while
  scraping gently with small strokes, using the bone structure to guide the
  knife. Cut away the second fillet from the first side. Turn the fish over
  and repeat the process. Roundfish, shaped like a tube, have a center
  backbone, separating two thick fillets. A line of bones extends upward from
  the spine, and a pair of bone creates an oval on the lower side of the
  fish, enclosing the entrails. You can create four fillets, but usually one
  is cut from each side. To fillet: Lay the fish on one side, with its tail
  towards you. Slice along the backbone from head to tail, exposing the
  backbone. Hold a knife parallel to the top ribs, cut down the length of the
  fillet, using short strokes to detach it completely. Turn fish around, hold
  it by the exposed backbone, and slice the other half of the fillet free.
  Flip the fish over, and fillet the other side. To skin fillets, lay them
  skin side down, and hold the tail end. Insert the knife at the shallow end
  and scrape along the skin to separate the it from the fillets. Run your
  fingers all along the top of the fillet and feel for pesky little bones.
  They can easily be removed with tweezers, a gesture that will be greatly
  appreciated by all who eat it.

  HEAT THE OVEN TO 350F. Trim the meat of visible fat and gristle, and set
  aside. Heat 3 tablespoons of the oil in a skillet over medium high heat.
  Add the lamb and brown on all sides, being careful not to crowd the pan;
  this will have to be done in batches. Remove the lamb with a slotted spoon,
  and place it in an oven-proof casserole. Add the remaining fat to the pan,
  and saute the onions, carrot and garlic, stirring frequently, until the
  onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Scrape the mixture into the
  casserole with the lamb. Add the tomatoes, thyme, rosemary, salt, pepper,
  parsley, wine and stock to the pan, and bring to a boil over medium high
  heat. Place the pan in the center of the oven and bake for 2 1/2 hours, or
  until the lamb is beginning to become tender. Add the beans, and bake for
  30 to 40 minutes. Serves 6 to 8. (The stew is even better if made a day or
  two in advance and refrigerated tightly covered. Discard any fat that
  hardens.) Reheat in a 350F oven, stirring occasionally but gently.

  LIGHT A GRILL OR PREHEAT a broiler. Pound the chicken breasts to an even
  thickness, and grill or broil on both sides until cooked through, but not
  dried out, about 4 minutes on a side. It makes sense to grill the peppers
  at the same time. Slice, and set aside. Combine the bell peppers, celery,
  onion, black beans and cilantro in a mixing bowl. Combine the vinegar, oil,
  orange juice, lime juice, garlic, coriander, pepper. Combine with salt and
  sour cream or yogurt in a jar with a tight-fitting lid. Shake well, and
  pour the dressing over the vegetables. Marinate the vegetables for 1 hour
  at room temperature. Place a large skillet over medium heat, and grill the
  tortillas for 30 seconds on a side to soften. To serve, divide the chicken
  among the tortillas, placing it at the center of the tortilla. Divide the
  vegetables and their dressing on top of the chicken, and roll the tortilla
  into a cylinder. Serve immediately; the dish should be at room temperature.
  Serves 6. Note: The chicken breasts, vegetable mixture and dressing can all
  be prepared a day in advance. Do not marinate the vegetables for more than
  1 hour. Cover with aluminum foil to reheat. Reheat the chicken in a 300F
  oven for 15 minutes.

  or the blunt side of a meat mallet. Repeat with remaining chicken breasts.
  Mix the sage with the salt, pepper and garlic. Rub the mixture on one side
  of the chicken breasts. Place a slice of ham over the seasoning, and then
  roll the chicken breast into a spiral. Secure the spiral closed with
  toothpicks or by tying them with string. Rub the rolls lightly with flour,
  shaking off any excess. Pour the oil into a skillet, and heat it over
  medium heat. Add the chicken rolls, being careful not to crowd the pan, and
  cook until golden brown on the bottom. Turn with tongs, and cook until all
  sides are brown, and the chicken is cooked in the center, about 15 to 20
  minutes. Drain on paper towels, and serve immediately. Serves 6.

      Title: Whole Salmon with Dill Sauce
 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      1    Whole salmon (about 6 lb)           1 c  Mayonnaise
      2 qt Court bouillon                    1/3 c  Grated onion
      2 c  Cumbers                           1/4 c  Lemon juice
      2    Lemons                            1/4 c  Chopped fresh dill
      1 pt Sour cream                               Salt and pepper to taste
 
  ~----------For decoration:--------- ~----------For the dill sauce:------
  POACH THE SALMON: To time the poaching, measure the fish and allow 10
  minutes for each inch of thickness; begin timing when the liquid starts to
  simmer. To check for doneness, insert a metal skewer into the thick flesh
  behind the gill. It should slide in easily. A six-pound salmon needs either
  a fish poacher or a roasting pan fitted with a rack at the bottom for easy
  fish lifting. I use a roaster. It usually means the fish has been curved to
  fit in, and the benefit of this is that it retains this jaunty pose once
  cooked so it fits more easily onto a platter. Chill it carefully, then
  unwrap it, and gently pull off the skin. If the fat underneath the skin is
  gray, scrape it away with a knife to reveal the orange flesh. Cut down the
  center of the fish to the backbone, and then ease one half of the fillet
  from the bones. Gently pull off the flesh, then remove the backbone and
  replace the fish. This way it is easier to serve at a buffet. Peel and

      Title: A Bloomin' Onion
 Categories: Appetizers, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 servings
 
           Water; ice                          2 tb Flour
           Water; boiling                      1 c  Cracker crumbs
      4    Eggs; beaten                   
 
  Select a well-rounded onion. Peel outer skin off. Leave root intact and cut
  off any hanging roots. Using a small, sharp knife, divide onion into four
  sections by making 2 cuts crosswise, beginning at the top and cutting
  toward root, stopping about 1/2" away. Cut each section twice. Place onion
  in bowl of enough boiling water to cover it and leave for 5 minutes. The
  sections, or petals, will begin to open. Remove onion from water and
  immerse into ice water, which will further the opening. Drain well by
  turning upside down on paper towel. Put flour into paper bag, add onion and
  shake gently to coat with flour. Roll floured onion in beaten egg to cover.
  Put cracker crumbs or coating in bag, add onion, and shake gently to coat.
  Refrigerate 1 hour before deep frying in oil to golden brown, 3 to 5
  minutes. Cooked onion can be kept for a time in warm oven. This recipe was
  posted some weeks ago. It did not include a sauce. If I remember correctly,
  the poster said to serve with Ranch Dressing for a sauce. I would just let
  my imagination go, on the sauce! I haven't tried this yet, even though it
  is tempting...I have to watch out for my husband's diet, so we try to stay
  away from fried things. Sorry, I don't know the name of the original
  poster, but that is his/her ID, after the recipe title. Barb Day

  1 1/2 c  Freshly grated parmesan        
 
       Wash the spinach and remove the stems.  In a large pan with the lid
  on, steam the leaves with a little salt in the water that clings to them,
  turning them over, until they crumple. Strain and squeeze every bit of
  water out with your hands: this is all-important and is the secret of
  success (otherwise the dumplings would fall apart). Finely chop the leaves
       Mash the ricotta and stir in the eggs, half the parmesan, salt,
  pepper, nutmeg and spinach.  Work very well, shape into balls the size of a
  walnut and roll in flour.
       Fill a large saucepan halfway with water, bring to the boil and very
  carefully drop in the dumplings. Keep the water barely simmering until the
  rise to the surface - they do so very quickly.
       Lift them out very carefully with a slotted spoon and serve very hot
  with melted butter and the remaining parmesan.

  duck(s) in pot. Add 1/2 cup sauterne, dry vermouth or water. Cover and cook
  on High 2 hours, then turn to Low for 8 hours. Before serving, remove

      Title: Kona Inn Banana Bread
 Categories: Breads, Fruits
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Butter                              2 ts Baking Soda
      2 c  Granulated Sugar                    1 ts Salt
      4    Eggs; beaten                        2 c  All purpose Flour
      6    Ripe Bananas; mashed              1/2 c  Macadamia Nuts chopped
 
  In a bowl cream the sugar and the butter well until a light lemon color.
  Then add the squashed bananas and the beaten eggs. Stir well until all
  ingredients are completely mixed. Sift the flour, the salt and the baking
  soda into the creamed mixture then add the chopped nuts. Again mix until
  blended but make sure you do not mix the batter too much. Pre heat the oven
  to 350 degrees and when the oven is up to temperature pour the batter into
  two prepared loaf pans and bake for 45 minutes. Before my wife died she
  often watched while I was making a mess in her kitchen doing my imitation
  of a bakery chef. She said that the Kona Inn Banana Bread should be renamed
  Garbage bread because I never stuck to the recipe and added all sorts of
  thing that I found such as any kind of chopped nuts, lemon and orange zest,
  chopped apricots, chopped mango, coconut flakes and one time I even added
  some mincemeat that was left over after baking some mince pies. Perhaps the
  Kona Inn should have taken me to court and forced me to stop making changes
  to their Banana Bread. Perhaps my use of their name for the resulting
  strange flavored versions of their Banana bread had something to do with
  their going out of business some years ago.

 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 ts Salt                                2 ts Cumin
      1 ts Pepper                              2    Cloves garlic minced
    1/2 ts Cayenne pepper                      2 lb Steak sliced thinly
      3 tb Chili powder                   
 
  Combine ingredients and thoroughly mix together. This is a dry marinade so
  there is no liquid. Sprinkle the spice mixture on the meat slices and work
  into the grain with your fingers. Cover and marinate overnight. Place trays
  in the oven and dry at 145'F. for first 4 hrs. then set oven 130'F. until
  dry.(4 to 8 hrs.) Jerky should be hard but not brittle. Blot up any fat
  that appears with paper towels. *For a chewy texture, slice the meat with
  the grain, or across the grain for more tender jerky. Thats all! It may
  take a few trys to figure out exactly how long to dry the meat, but you're
  still eating while you're trying so it's not that bad. Well, good luck, I
  hope that you like it. And, sorry this note is so long.

  well.  Please note: You can make variations of this recipe in several ways:

      Title: Flank Steak with Peppers Stir Fry
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Flank steak                         1    Onion; medium sized
      3 tb Soy sauce; reduced sodium           2    Celery; stalks
      3 tb Vegetable oil                     1/2 c  Beef broth
      4 ts Cornstarch                        1/4 ts Black pepper
      1    Bell pepper; red or green           5    Fresh ginger; slices 1/4"thk
 
  Cut the steak with the grain into 2" wide strips, then cut each strip
  across the grain into 1/4" slices. (You will find the meat is easier to
  slice if you place it in the freezer for a short while before slicing) In a
  medium bowl, combine the steak with the soy sauce, 1 tb. of the oil and 2
  ts. of the cornstarch.  Stir to coat the steak and set aside. Cut the
  pepper into thin slivers. Cut the onion into 1/2" thick wedges.
   Cut the celery on the diagonal into 1/2" slices.  In a small bowl, stir
  together the broth, black pepper and the remaining 2 ts. cornstarch and set
  aside. In a large skillet or wok, warm 1 tb of the oil over med. high heat.
  When the oil is very hot, but not smoking, add the beef and the marinade
  and stir-fry until the beef is browned, but still slightly pink in the
  center, 2 to 3 minutes.  Transfer the beef to a plate and set aside. Add
  the remaining 1 tb. of oil to the skillet. Add the pepper, onion, celery
  and ginger, and stir-fry until the onions begin to wilt, 2 to 3 minutes.
  Return the beef to the skillet.  Stir the broth mixture, add it to the
  skillet and bring the liquid to a boil. Cook, stirring constantly, until
  the vegetables are crisp-tender and the beef is cooked through 2 to 3
  minutes longer.  Serve hot with steamed rice. Do-Ahead Time savers: All of
  the vegetables can be prepared ahead of time and refrigerated, covered
  until ready to cook. The broth mixture can be made well ahead and the beef
  can be mixed with its marinade several hours ahead...in fact, I think it is
  better when marinated for a time before the actual cooking. Calories: 348

  When I cook, I have made it a habit to gather the ingredients, measure them
  and set them aside, ready for the time when they are needed. You will find
  that this is one of the secrets of preparing good Oriental dishes, as they
  usually contain many ingredients, lots of chopping, and are cooked rather
  quickly. Barb

      Title: Original Buffalo Wings
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      5 lb Fresh large chicken wings                Melted Margarine
           Peanut oil for frying                    Celery Sticks
           Durkee/French Hot Sauce                  Chunky Blue Cheese Salad Dre
           Wingers Original Recipe Hot    
 
  1. Split the wings at the joint and remove the tips. Anchor Bar has barrels
  of tips they use in soup stock. 2. Spread the wings out on a rack in a pan
  and refrigerate so they drain of moisture/blood.A minimum of 24 hours. This
  small step will help produce a 'crispier' final product. 3 Heat deep
  fryerto 350-360 degrees. 4. Fry wings in small batches until done-8-10
  minutes, depending on the equipment. 5 Drain of excess oil and immediately
  place in large bowl and coat with hot sauce & melted margarine. 6. Serve
  with celery sticks and blue cheese. NOTE:The amounts of Hot Sauce and
  Margarine are really to taste. Medium 'HEAT' Wings are approx. obtained by
  using 1 cup of Hot Sauce for the entire 5# and 1/2c. of melted margaine.
  Experiment-some places do not use the melted marg. at all and just vary the
  volume of hot sauce to get the taste they want. The background on "Orginal
  Buffalo Chicken Wings" is this: Frank & Theressa's Anchor Bar is where it
  all started. Theressa Bellissimo received by mistake a 30# box of
  wings,ususally used in making soup. Her husband Frank asked her one night
  to fix a snack at the restaurant for he and a bunch of his friends.
  Theressa decided that these wings would be just the thing and went out and
  bought a bottle(s) of cayenne pepper sauce. There were many varieties and
  one was named "FRANKS". She deep fried the split wings, mixed the Franks
  Hot Sauce with some melted margarine and coated the deep fried wings. That
  in short was the beginning of an industry. It was 1964, and the Anchor Bar
  was the only spot you could get these things. The secret was in the sauce
  and the sauce was Franks Hot sauce,which was produced by the Frank Tea &
  Spice Co, later on bought by Durkee Foods and now a part of the
  Durkee/French Foods Co.However,back then most folks thought FRANK
  Bellissimo, invented the sauce! Actually,he was more famous around here
  than Dr. Jacob Frank who perfected the Louisiana Sunlong Pepper which was
  the base for the product. Anyway,today the Bellissimo's and their son
  Dominic are all part of history. It was Dominic who went"public" with the
  product and told the story from here to London Eng. and to countless
  publications. The Anchor Bar today is run by his wife and still does
  thousands of pounds of wings a week. ENJOY!! GEORGE IN BUFFALO

  hot "stew" and should be served with something to cut the heat. I enjoy
  slaw and some good bread. Hot mustard goes well with the sausage and tarter
  sauce goes well with the shrimp. A six pack of your favorate beverage might
  also be a good idea. Hope you enjoy 01/14 09:36 pm Rob Elliotte from

  Palacsinta: Beat egg whites until stiff. Add egg yolks, sugar, and salt.
  Beat until dough is not gritty from sugar. Add vanilla and flour by
  spoonfuls along with wine and milk. Beat until smooth, to a thin batter.
  Heat frying pan. Brush lightly with shortening and pour in enough batter to
  cover pan with very thin layer. (Tilt pan so batter spreads evenly, like
  pancakes). Brown on one side. Turn and brown other side. Use favorite
  filling. (Try cottage cheese and black raspberry. preserves. Very good.) We
  spread the filling (which ever one you choose) on the palascinta and then
  roll up and dust it with powder sugar (if desired). Do not put too much
  filling because as you eat it, it might drip out. Enjoy, you will like it.

  boil in a suitable saucepan. Put the steamed rice in a large bowl and pour
  the coconut milk mixture over it. Mix well. Let it stand for a while so the
  rice can absorb the liquid. You may then eat it as is, or, as we prefer,
  introduce large chunks of freshly peeled mango fruit. This dish has been a
  hit everytime we serve it!! It was originally posted on this Board back in

      Title: Carol's Sketti Sauce
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Ground sirloin                      1    Green bell pepper, minced
      1 lb Ground porterhouse                  1    Red bell pepper, minced
      2 tb Olive oil                          10    Large - golf size mushrooms,
      3    Medium onions, coarsely chop        4    Very large ripe tomatoes, ch
      2    Leeks, sliced (white portion    1 1/3 tb Oregano
      6 tb Minced garlic (more if desir        1 tb Thyme
      3 cn NO SALT added tomatoes            2/3 tb White pepper
      1 cn NO SALT added tomato sauce          2 tb Dried cilantro
      1 cn LOW SALT chicken broth              4 tb Dried parsley
      2 cn Water (use the chicken broth        1 tb Sugar
      4    Ribs of celery & leaves, cho        2    Bay leaves
 
  Here is what I do.  I brown the meat in the olive oil. I add the onions &
  saute till they are somewhat tender. I then add all the other ingredients.
  Usually the canned ones first then the fresh ingred. Let this come to a
  boil & then turn down.  Simmer with the stockpot cover OFF for 6 or more
  hours.  Of course, you can use sooner. I like it to cook down & thicken.
  Either way it is very good. Many times I add more mushrooms as I like them.
  Do slice them thickly; i.e. 3 slices to one very large mushroom. I like to
  see the mushrooms! SMILE. This isn't a traditional recipe for spaghetti
  sauce.  It is something that has "happened" over the years. It finally
  developed into what you see. My husband, Punky aka Hap, enjoys this recipe
  very much.  I certainly hope you do too. I don't think I have forgotten
  anything. Oh, we use the low salt stuff - you don't have to do that. My guy
  had bypass surgery in Aug. so we are watching the sodium. I now make this
  with ground turkey too.  It is very good with the turkey. Several Prodigy
  members have tried this recipe. To my delight--they have liked it very
  much.  I hope you do too.  Oh, yes, this does freeze well. I just made 16
  quarts of this on Sunday. I usually add some more garlic when I unfreeze a
  portion.  This seems to make it tastier. We love garlic in our sketti! I
  also add some red crushed pepper flakes to my plate of sketti. Punky does
  not like things as hot as I. Remember to adjust seasonings to your taste.
  Enjoy. Carol Rheaume-Frischknecht l/l5 ll:03 PM PST

      2    Med ripe bananas; sliced          1/2 c  Chopped walnuts
 
  This is the recipe I have used for my Hitachi bread machine. We really like
  it. You could use all white flour instead of wheat if you like. I add the
  walnuts at the beginning with other ingred. It seems to mix better. You can
  also add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon if you like. We like it better without. Sandy

      4    Scallions chopped                   1 pn Cloves
      1 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour             Salt and pepper to taste

      1 pn Allspice                       
 
    1/2 cup fresh blueberries (optional garnish) Melt the butter in a large
  heavy skillet and gently saute the scallions for 5 mins. Shake the flour in
  a plastic bag with the spices, salt and pepper. Drop the livers into the
  bag with the flour,shake them to coat well, and empty bag into a strainer
  set over a bowl. Shake the strainer to remove excess flour. Return the
  skillet with the scallions to the stov,raise the heat,and when hot add
  livers and cook, turning occasion-ally,for about 5 mins.or until livers are
  browned slightly stiffened. Remove them with a spoon and keep warm. Add the
  vinegar to the skillet and deglqaze over high heat, scraping up any browned
  bits and reducing the vinegar to a few syrupy spoonfuls. Whisk in the creme
  fraiche and boil for 1 min.  If you are using fresh blueberrie, add them to
  the sauce and simmer gently for another 2 or 3 mins, just long enough to
  heat the berries through without overcooking them. Arrange the livers on
  serving dishes and spoon the sauce over them. Serve immediately. 4 portions
  as an appetizer, 2 or3 portions as main course. This is not my cup of tea
  'cause I don't like liver,bit if you do, it sounds interesting. In The New
  Basics Cookbook, by the same ladies,they say to use fruit vinegars in salad
  dressings with nut or olive oils. Fruit salads are also enhanced by a touch
  of fruit vinegar. I hope this helps you a little. I know it's not much..

  cradle the salad. This will serve 6 so I suggest you cut it in half. --From

      Title: Sauces To Go with Moroccan Couscous
 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 1 servings
 
------------------------SWEET ONION AND RAISIN SAUCE------------------------
      2    Small, hot fresh peppers            2 ts Cinnamon
    1/3 c  Butter                              1 ts Pepper
      1 c  Raisins                             1 c  Sugar or honey
 
  Start this at least 1 hour before serving so that it can get a mahogany
  color.  Saute onions in butter, stirring frequently, until they soften and
  turn golden. Add other ingredients and cook and stir, letting mixture
  almost burn on the bottom a few times before stirring it up. In this way it
  will be a lovely, dark brown. Hot Sauce: Remove 2 or 3 ladles of broth to
  small saucepan about 20 min. before serving and simmer with whole hot
  peppers. I have not tried these receipes but they do sound good. Later I
  will post some of my couscous receipes. Also want to prepare and also post
  a receipe for beef brochettes. Gary, if you are reading this I doubt if we
  could ever duplicate the Moroccan cooking. The country and the atmosphere
  had a lot to do with the flavor of the food. Hope you don't mind someone
  else adding their 2 cents. My husband was stationed in Morocco from
  1970-72.  The Couscous postings brought back wonderful memories. In fact,
  thanks to Gary's posting my husband and I bought a steamer. Now, all I have
  to do is purchase some cheesecloth so the couscous does not fall through
  the holes. I also dug out my old Morocccan cookbook, COOKING IN MOROCCO by
  the American Women's Association of Rabat. Lots of Coucous receipes, but
  none calling for harissa.  Did find 2 receipes for sauces to be served with
  couscous. Carolyn in Asheville

      Title: Rack of Lamb Dijon
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1    Rack of lamb; medium                     Italian bread crumbs
           Dijon mustard                  
 
  Have the butcher take off the chine bone--or at the very least score it
  through so that the chops can be cut. The ends of the chops should be
  'Frenched"...so you can see the bone. Put dijon all over the lamb...coat it
  well.  Pat the bread cumbs on top of the mustard, so that they adhere.
  particularly important on the rounded side...the top. Place lamb in a
  pre-heated over...450 degrees.  Roast for about 35 minutes. This will give
  you a RARE lamb rack...the only way as far as I am concerned. Rest for 10
  minutes and serve. Will serve two, or one very hungry person. Recipe was
  adapted from FINALLY   MICHAEL'S (RESTAURANT) in Framingham, MA. Enjoy!!!!!

      Title: Yorkshire Pork Chops
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1    Lg golden delicious apple           3    Eggs
      4 tb Olive oil                           1 c  Flour
      4    Pork loin chops - 1-1/2 to 2        2 tb Melted butter
      1 c  Milk                              1/2 ts Salt
 
  (Serve with warm applesauce.. OPTIONAL) Peel and slice the apple into 4
  thick rings.  Melt the oil in an oven-proof pan, and brown them for about 1
  minute on each side. Put an apple ring on each chop. Whisk the milk, eggs,
  flour butter and salt until well mixed. Pour the batter over the chops and
  bake for about 35 minutes at 450~ or until the batter is browned and puffy.
  Serve immediately - with the warm applesauce. Since the Yorkshire batter
  bakes with the pork chops, it swells up and around the chops and becomes
  crisp on top, but stays soft and moist inside - like you think of yorkshire
  pudding.  If you use thin chops they will tend to become dry and tough, so
  best use thick ones for this recipe.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 oz Salt pork or smoked bacon                Olive oil
    1/3 c  Freshly grated Parmesan chee             Pepper
      4    Eggs                                     Salt
 
   (1) Heat the oil in a saucepan, add the salt pork cut in small pieces, and
  cook until golden brown.
   (2) Beat the eggs just enough to mix the yolks and whites well. (You may
  also use just the yolks alone.) (3) Add the grated cheese, a pinch of salt,
  and pepper, > and continue stirring. Add a few tablespoons cream, if you
  want to, to reach desired consistency. After the pasta is boiled and
  drained, pour it into a large bowl.
   (4)  Add the salt pork and the beaten eggs and cheese and mix everything
  together very quickly.  Serve immediately. This sauce is especially good
  with spaghetti or bucatini. Don't ask me what bucatini is - I'm just
  quoting from the book!

      4 oz Jar pimientos                            Coarse ground black pepper t
           Cayenne pepper to taste                  Mayonnaise
      1 ts Worcestershire sauce               24    Slices white or whole wheat
 
  Grate cheese on the small side of a hand grater in a large mixing bowl.
  Drain the liquid from the pimientos and mash with a fork. Add pimientos to
  the cheese in the bowl. Add cayenne, worcestershire sauce, hot pepper sauce
  and black pepper to taste. Add enough Mayonnaise (about 3 T.) to reach the
  desired consistency and mix thoroughly. Use your hands or a big, wide fork
  to mix.  The mixture will become firmer as it sets in the refrigerator.
  (You can trim the edges of the bread at this point-I don't unless making
  them for finger food.. Spread each slice of bread with mayonnaise on one
  side.  Put the cheese filling on 12 slices of bread, then put the other 12
  mayonnaise coated bread slices on top. Slice the sandwiches diagonally or
  into strips.  Be sure to put lots of filling into the sandwiches.

    1/2 ts Dried thyme                       1/3 c  Plus 1 tsp ice-cold water
 
  Cut pork into 1 1/2 " cubes, trimming all gristle and bone. Pass through a
  meat grinder with a coarse blade. Adjust the fat-to-lean ratio to be about
  1:3 if you can. Put pork in a large stainless or ceramic crock or bowl. Mix
  the dry spices in a small bowl. Using your hands, toss the meat while
  adding the spices a small amount at a time. When half the spices are in,
  add half the ice water. Mix keeping the meat as loose as possible. Add
  remaining spices & water as above. At this point you may fry a small patty
  of the meat to test for seasonings. Adjust if necessary. Refrigerate the
  sausage mix overnight. You may check for seasonings again the next day (but
  be careful! You'll be tempted to fry it all right then and eat it up!)
  Stuff the mix into about 5' of rinsed casings, tying off about 8" lengths.
  You may grill, steam or fry the sausages as you prefer.

      1    Egg                            
 
  NOODLES: This is a lost art. may I add that I usually use wonton skins and
  make life easy for myself; but once in awhile.... Add salt to eggs,add eggs
  to flour. mix with your hands until the dough leaves the sides of the bowl.
  It should be fairly stiff. Knead until dough is smooth and elastic. Roll
  out on a lightly floured board (or on a white cloth). Roll and stretch
  until it is paper thin...well very thin. Cut into 3" squares. Place one T
  of filling in center of each square and fold to make a triangle. Crimp
  edges with a fork and cook in boiling water. If you have a pasta machine
  (or I sometimes use FP go for it. Cook until they rise to the top; about 10
  or 12 minutes. DO NOT COOK IN THE SOUP. You may warm them in the soup.
   FILLINGS. These days I zap all the ingredients for each type of filling in
  the FP...leaving the eggs for last. For the cheese filling, you just want
  to combine. I would serve all but the cheese with Chicken Noodle soup. the
  Cheese Kreplach are usually served on the side (for a dairy meal) with sour
  cream. Each of these recipes makes about 30; figure at least 3 each

  mixture to a bowl and add eggs, Kaffir lime leaves, cilantro leaves and
  fish sauce and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until well blended. Heat
  oil in a large flat bottom fry pan over medium heat. Meanwhile, dip hands
  in water and form the soy bean mixture into patties, about 1-1/2 inch in
  diameter each. Fry until well done and golden brown. Drain the oil on paper
  towels. Serve hot with dipping sauce. Dipping Sauce ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Heat
  salt, sugar and vinegar in a small saucepan over low heat until the salt

  The mixture must be on the dry side. If the mixture is
      too soggy it won't be crispy when fried. The solution
      would be to lay the patties out on a cookie sheet to
      air dry about 15 minutes or so before frying.

  frying pan, Teflon makes life easy, and smear with a very thin coat of
  butter.  When pan is hot, put in about 1/4 cup batter, tilt pan until it
  covers.  Cook until it begins to blister and is shiny. Turn out on table
  cloth. I always use one, but I Guess you can use paper towels. Continue
  until all the batter is used. Should make 10 or 12 circles. Mix the
  ingredients well. Now it's time to 'build your blintzas' as my daughter
  used to say. Put some filling off center on each circle. Fold the bottom up
  and the top down.  Tuck  in sides, or fold in, before you put the op down.
  Confused? Just try it, it's easy. At this point you can store them in the
  fridge,  or freeze them.  They freeze well. To finish, just fry them in a
  small amount of butter, until browned Great, served with sour cream. They
  are a bit complicated, but not really difficult. Howard, I am giving you
  the recipe for 24 because it is so easy and they freeze so well. Use well
  seasoned pans, 6". This should make about 50 pancakes. I guess the
  directions don't change when you change the ammounts.

      Title: Vienna Christmas Stollen
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Milk;scald/cool to lukewarm       1/2 c  Butter; softened
  3 1/2    Yeast;dry/envelopes                      Flour; 10-11 c. as needed
    3/4 c  Water; lukewarm                     5 c  Sultanas; (currants)
      3 c  Flour; sifted                   1 1/2 c  Almonds;chopped or slivered
    1/2 c  Eggs; yolks/lightly beaten          1 c  Citron; chopped
    3/4 c  Sugar                             1/2    Lemon; rind only/grated
      2 ts Salt                                2 ts Rum
      1 c  Flour                          
 
  Milk should be cooled to about 100 degrees. Dissolve the yeast in the
  lukewarm water and add 1/4 c. of the cooled milk and 3 c. sifted flour.
  Cover the sponge with a cloth and let it ripen until bubbles appear on the
  surface and it is about to drop in the center. Pour the remaining milk over
  the sponge. Add the egg yolks, sugar and salt and beat until the
  ingredients are well blended. Add 1 cup flour and beat well. Blend in the
  butter. Add more flour gradually to make a smooth dough, or until 10 to 11
  cups have been added. Some flours absorb more liquid than others. Knead in
  the sultanas, almonds, and citron, along with the lemon rind which should
  be mixed with the rum. Knead the dough until the fruits and nuts are
  dispersed well through it and it is smooth. Dust the top lightly with flour
  and let it rise in a warm place about 45 minutes. Punch it down and let
  stand for 20 minutes. Divide the dough in half and knead the pieces until
  smooth. Let them stand for 10 minutes longer. Place one ball of dough on a
  lightly floured board, and with a rolling pin, press down the center of the
  ball, and roll the pin to and fro 4 to 5 times, pressing all the time to
  make an elliptical shape 6 inches long and 3 1/2" wide. The center rolled
  part should be 1/8" thick and 4 inches long. Both ends should remain
  untouched, resembling rather thick lips. Place this rolled out piece of
  dough on a buttered baking sheet and brush the center part with melted
  butter. Fold one lip toward the other and on the top of it. Press the
  fingertips down near and below the lips, pulling somewhat apart. Give a
  pull away from each end, pointing them toward the lips. The shape should
  resemble a waning moon. Repeat the process with the second piece of dough.
  (Unless you have gone completely crazy by now! note: my comment, not
  Gourmet's). Let the Stollen rise, covered in a warm place until they double
  in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Bake them in a moderately hot oven (375
  degrees) for 35 to 40 minutes. Do not overbake them. Cool them on racks.
  Brush them with butter and cover with vanilla sugar. Recipe will be posted

      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 pk Dry yeast                                Flour
           Sugar                               2 ts Salt
  1 1/4 c  Lukewarm milk                     1/2 c  Butter, softened

-------------------------------CHEESE FILLING-------------------------------
      1 lb Muenster Cheese                     1    Egg, beaten
      2 tb Butter                         
 
  Sprinkle yeast and 1/2 teaspoon sugar over milk in small shallow bowl.
  Cover with plastic wrap and place in warm place until yeast blooms and
  mixture nearly doubles in vol- ume, 5 to 10 minutes. Combine 4 1/2 cups
  flour, 1 tablespoon sugar and salt in large mixing bowl. Make well in flour
  mixture and add milk-yeast mixture and softened butter. Beat vigorously
  with large spoon until smooth.  Form into ball and place on lightly floured
  surface.  Knead hard 10 minutes, adding more flour or water as needed to
  create medium stiff dough. When dough is smooth and elastic, place in
  large, lightly buttered bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and kitchen towel and
  let rise in warm, draft-free place, such as unlit oven with pilot light on,
  until doubled in bulk and dough springs back slowly when gently poked with
  finger, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Punch dough down and let rise until again
  doubled, 30 to 40 minutes. Punch dough down and roll out on lightly floured
  surface into circle about 22 inches in diameter. If rolling surface is too
  small, divide dough in half and roll into 2 half-circles 22 by 11 inches.
  Roll dough up on rolling pin and unroll carefully over buttered 9-inch cake
  or springform pan or springform so that it is centered, with edges
  overlapping more or less evenly on all sides. If using 2 half circles of
  dough, form 1-inch seam to make whole circle and moisten thoroughly to
  seal. Carefully press center of dough down to bottom of pan. Place cheese
  filling on dough and bring up edges of dough over filling, forming thick,
  fabriclike folds. Moisten edges at top and seal. Let stand 10 to 15
  minutes.  Bake at 375 degrees in center of oven, on foil in case filling
  leaks, until golden brown, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Cool 1 to 2 hours before
  serving. Makes 12 to 16 servings.
                   Cheese Filling In large mixing bowl, combine cheese,
  butter, and egg. Knead vigorously until mixture is uniform. Shape into
  thick, round cake 8 to 7 1/2 inches in diameter.

      Title: Caribbean Cabbage
 Categories: Meats, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Pork steaks                         1 tb Ground Allspice
      1    Small cabbage head                       Salt & pepper; to taste
      4    Carrots                             1 tb Butter, margerine or oil
      1 c  Chicken stock or broth              2 tb Water; for deglazing
    1/4 ts Garlic salt                    
 
  Brown pork steaks in butter, margerine or oil. Set aside to cool. Deglaze
  skillet with 2 T water. Pour liquor into a 4 qt pot. Cut carots into 1/8"
  thick slices. Add to pot and set pot over medium heat. Add chicken stock,
  garlic salt, allspice, salt and pepper to pot. Remove any bones from the
  pork steaks and cut them crosswise into 1/4" wide strips. Add the pork
  strips to the pot. Core and coarsly chop the cabbage. Add to pot. Stir well
  to mix all the ingredients. Cover the pot and allow the meat and vegetables
  to steam for a few minutes, but not too long. The carrots and cabbage
  should still be somewhat crisp (al dente) when served. Serve with steamed
  rice. OPTIONS: Alter spices any way you like. Add, delete or substitute any
  of the ingredients. This dish is versatile, fast, easy and very
  inexpensive. Since this is my first attempt at uploading from MM to the
  Food Forum, I thought this was an appropriate recipe. It's the first thing
  I ever cooked that had more than one ingredient. It dates back to my
  college days (early 60's) when I, nor my roommates, had much money. We had
  to build meals for four hungry guys on a budget that allowed less than five
  bucks per meal. One of the group hailed from Jamaica W.I. He devised this
  recipe based (loosly) on something his grandmother prepared. It cost less
  than two bucks to feed us all. Needless to say we started eating a
  variation of this recipe almost every night. On Friday night we spent the
  money we had saved to buy the five basic food groups (chili dogs, fries,
  pizza, burgers and beer). Today, thirty years later, this recipe will still
  feed four people for less than five dollers and takes less than 20 minutes
  to make.

      3 c  Onion, Chopped                      1 c  Whipping Cream (or 1/2-1/2)
    2/3 c  Unsalted Butter                     1 ts Chervil, dried
      3    Garlic Cloves, minced               1 ts Basil, dried
    2/3 c  Flour                               1 ts Tarragon, dried
      8 c  Milk                                3 tb Parsley, chopped fresh
      3    Egg Yolks                      
 
       Nutmeg, salt, white pepper Saute onion in butter in heavy skillet
  until onions become soft and transparent, then add garlic and cook a few
  minutes more. Stir in the flour and cook for about 3 minutes more--careful
  not to scorch!  Pour the milk in and immediately wisk to blend. Add the
  herbs and bring to boil stirring to avoid lumps. Simmer for at least 15
  minutes.  Season to taste with nutmeg, salt, pepper. Before serving, whisk
  the egg yolks into the cream then whisk the mixture into the soup. You can
  substitute milk for the cream if you want a lighter soup. * This soup is an
  excellent base for a wide variety of soups. I like to add fresh herbs and
  sometimes some cheese to the soup. Chopped ham, turkey, or chicken
  (leftovers), or any diced begetables can make an even meatier soup. If you
  add pureed vegetables you might want to reduce the amount of flour to keep
  the soup from getting too thick. * You can saute chopped vegetables
  separately and add right after the milk is poured in for wonderful
  vegetable cream soups.  Cabbage and Brussels Sprouts are two that work
  particularly well. * The original of this recipe is from Francois Kissel
  who had the Brasserie Pittsbourg in Seattle--an outstanding restaurant!

      Title: Corned Beef
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      8 lb Brisket; boneless                   1    Garlic; the whole head
      1 c  Salt                              1/4 ts Saltpeter
    1/2 ts Sugar                               1 pn Alum
      2 tb Mixed pickling spices          
 
  This recipe is 'supposedly' from GREENWALD'S SUPER DELICATESSEN,
  Louisville, KY. It was in LOVE AND KNISHES; Sara Kasdan; 1956. Sara says it
  comes from a 'hamish' deli; (very homelike) in a poor neighobrhood.
  Doubtful it still exists. And my copy of the book is on its way out too!!!
  OK here goes...Place brisket in a large stoneware crock and cover
  completely with water. Add remaining ingredients, stirring to distribute
  them evenly (I   would add more garlic and more peppercorns; never enough
  in the mix) Let it stand at room temp for 4 days. place in the fridge for
  16 days.   Remove from the crock and place in a large kettle. Cover with
  boiling water and boil for 1 1/2 hours. Turn off heat and let stand in
  water in which it has cooked for at least 2 hours. Remove meat to another
  deep kettle. Place in sink and let cold waater run into the kettle (not
  directly ON the meat) for 1 hour. (this seals the meat juices) Remove
  brisket from the water and refrigerate unntil ready to use. If you serve
  hot; steanm...do NOT boil. Well let me add that she quotes Mr. Greenwald.
  "You have to be crazy to go to all this trouble when you can buy at
  Greenwald's fancy new delicatessen." Mr. Greenwald is right...you HAVE TO
  BE CRAZY; but if you can't get it any other way...this sounds KOSHER to me.
  Perhaps one of our great Kosher cooks can come up with a more modern
  method, <grin>!!!  Oh yes, the deli moved after WWII to the Highland
  section...a fancy, 'shmancy' neighborhood.

  qts. My changes:  I eliminate the tarragon vinegar in the mayo mixture, and
  use 1/4 cup tarragon vinegar in the herb mix. I use green onions (4 or 5)

      Title: Simple Salmon Fillets
 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 2 servings
 
    3/4 lb Salmon; fillets are best                 Salt
      1    Lemon                                    Pepper; white
      1 ts Dill; dried or better, fresh        2 tb Mayonaise
 
  Hopefully you selected 2 nice fillets. Preheat the oven to 400F. Place the
  fillets skin side down in a baking dish (I use glass). Squeeze the lemon
  over and lightly sprinkle with salt and some white pepper.
   Then spread the dill over the fillets and let set for fifteen minutes--if
  you have the time!  Spread the Mayo evenly over the entire surface and cut
  end(s) of the fillets (just like spreading peanut butter).
   Place on a high shelf in the oven (just under the broiler element). Bake
  for 10 to 15 minutes for each inch of thickness. Then kick the broiler in
  for a few minutes, just until you see some browning of the mayo. * This
  technique will give you delicious, moist salmon every time--just don't
  overdo the cooking!  The broiler bit isn't mandatory, it just gives a nice
  finish.  If you skip the broiler then just add a few minutes to the baking
  time.

      Title: Pizza
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2 c  Tepid water                       1/2 c  Corn meal
      2 pk Instant yeast                     1/4 ts Salt
      4 tb Olive oil                         1/2 c  Salad oil
  5 1/2 c  Flour                          
 
  Mix this with 3 c flour for about 10 minutes. Then add rest of flour and
  kneed 15 more minutes. Let dough rise once to double size. Punch down. Then
  divide the dough in two (makes two pizzas). Spread out dough flat. Oil the
  pan with olive oil and sprinkle with corn meal. Spread the dough out in the
  pan and spread it around to cover the entire bottom, then push it up the
  sides - like a pie crust.  If it doesn't cover the whole pan push it around
  til it does. Let it rise again. Put thin slices of mozzarella over the
  entire bottom of the pizza. Squish and drain well one large can of skinned
  plum tomatoes, and spread that over the cheese. Add a smidge of salt (I
  also add ground black pepper). Chop or crush garlic over this (I use lots).
  Basil and oregano sprinkled generously on top. Put on filing to taste (I
  use sliced onions and spicy Italian sausage). Then sprinkle over the top a
  combo of fresh grated Parma and Romano. Bake for 35 to 40 min at 475. Crust
  should be brown and crunchy. Hope you like it. I usually make two at a
  time, with one having no meat on it for the non-meat crowd (using zuccini
  peppers, mushrooms, onions). One pizza is usually enough for 4 people with
  a salad. Hope you like it, David.

  Preheat oven to 350.  Lightly grease baking sheet. Stir together the flour,

  Combine milk and egg. Mix into dry ingredients, gather dough into a ball.
  Roll dough out 1/2" thick onto a lightly floured surface. Cut into 3"
  circles with a sharp knife or biscuit cutter. (A glass does not work well

      Title: Juan's Killer Flan
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 cn Evaporated milk                     1 tb Vanilla extract
      1 cn Sweetened condensed milk          1/2    Lemon; juice only
      2 c  Sugar                               8    Eggs
    1/4 c  Water                          
 
  Preheat oven to 375 . Mix eggs, condensed milk, evaporated milk, 1 cup of
  the sugar, vanilla and lemon juice in large bowl. Mix well, no solids
  allowed, and the sugar must blend very evenly. (Add a little bit of
  Amaretto or Bailey's Irish Cream if you feel adventurous, or a little
  softened cream cheese). In a meat loaf or bread mold, put the remaining 1
  cup of sugar and the water tilt the mix so that becomes a syrupy mix. Heat
  on high, watching it and moving it every once in a while to spread the heat
  evenly. When it starts to turn brown, take it off the heat. The syrup
  should be a medium caramel color. Put it in the freezer and let it set.
  After the caramel sets, pour in the flan mixture you made in the bowl.
  Cover TWICE and seal well with aluminum foil. Put the mold inside another
  larger pan (double boiler) and fill the middle with water so that it almost
  reaches the edge of the inside mold. It is VERY important to seal the top
  of the mold; if steam or hot air gets inside the flan will not come out
  creamy and firm (it will look like swiss cheese on the outside). Set oven
  to BAKE and cook for 1 hour. Turn oven off and let it cool, then take the
  flan out, remove from the larger pan and put it in the fridge to cool.
  Ought to serve 8 or so, but I've seen it serve 1 over 3-days. It will last
  quite a bit as long as it is refrigerated. +++++DON'T FORGET TO SEAL THE
  PAN REALLY WELL! (BOOM! DIET'S DEAD!) Recipe from Juan Jiminez, GEnie

 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      2 lb Haddock; fillet                   1/2 c  Horseradish; prepared
           Tomato juice; or V8/to cover      1/4 c  Sour cream
    1/2 c  Chili sauce                    
 
  Poach fish in tomato juice to cover with spices of your choice or in V8.
  Simmer until fish flakes. Mix the other ingredients together and adjust for
  YOUR taste. Add the sauce to the fish...making sure it is not too thick. It
  should look like lobster salad and you can use diced celery and/or onion.
  In the 50's whenever you went to a luncheon at the Temple it seems that
  this was the dish of choice. I guess we were trying to prove we could have
  'lobster' and be kosher too, <GRIN>!!!! Anyway it is quite good. If you
  have a fovorite lobster or shrimp salad; you could just substitute the
  fish. Back in those days it was cheaper...now who knows??? Recipe

      Title: Farmer's Cheese
 Categories: Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      5 qt Buttermilk; low-fat                      Cheesecloth strainer
           Water                          
 
  Place the five quarts of buttermilk in a non corrosive pan; i.e. enamel or
  stainless steel.  Pour water at least half way up the sides of the
  containers (use cardboard ones; not glass bottles). Bring to a boil and let
  it go for 20 minutes.  Turn of and wait until the water is tepid. hang the
  cheesecloth strainer over the sink or over a large pot. You will need help
  here. Pour each quart of 'cooked' buttermilk into the strainer and let it
  hang at least 12 hours.  What you will have left in the bag is a very dry
  cheese...similar to Farmer's cheese.  Now my Stepmom sometimes adds a bit
  of sugar to the cheese.  If you put it in the FP and zap it with a some
  milk you have a creamy spread; similar to cream cheese. We use this in
  Blintzas and in place of ricotta in some recipes.
   It would be wonderful if you need Farmer's cheese and can't get it.

  The VERY BEST guacamole I ever tasted was at the Guadalajara Grill in Old

  Haas avacodas).
   Here's their recipe: Slice the avacodas in half, remove the pit and scoop
  out the pulp with a spoon. Add all ingredients and mix gently,
  crisscrossing two spoons in the bowl. The idea is to leave the avacoda in
  small chuncks. Susan Husij

    3/4 lb Bacon                                    Chicken stock as necessary
      1 lb Kale                                5 ts Balsamic vinegar
      2    Cloves garlic                       1    Bunch chives
           Salt and pepper                          Diced green onion tops/botto
 
  Peel potatoes and put in a pot with cold, salted water to cover. Cover pot
  and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer, uncover, and cook until done,
  about 25 minutes. Drain, reserving cooking liquid. Break up the potatoes
  with a potato masher (they should be quite lumpy, not smooth). Meanwhile,
  cook the bacon over low heat until crisp, turning often. Drain and chop
  into 1/2 inch chunks. Pour off all but 2 TBS of the bacon fat, and, reserve
  extra fat. Stem and chop the kale. Mince the garlic. Put half the kale and
  half the garlic into the frying pan. Season with salt and pepper and cook
  over medium heat until kale is wilted, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl.
  Repeat using more bacon fat as needed. Return all kale to the fry pan and
  add the heavy cream. Simmer over very low heat until the kale is tender,
  about 10 more minutes. Combine potatoes with about 3 cups of the potato
  cooking liquid and 1 cup of the chicken stock. Add more stock if needed to
  get a good consistency. Add kale mixture (with the bacon) to the pot and
  bring to a simmer. Season to taste with the vinegar and salt and pepper.
  This is up to you as to how much vinegar you use. Mince the chives or green
  onions and place in an extra bowl to top the soup. I hope you find this
  excellent soup. It is great this time of year as it is much like a warm
  German Potato salad.  If you pass this one up you will be the loser. Take
  care from Ken/still looking for a name for his piranha in rainy but warm

  use the figs, take them out after you steep them for about a half hour. Put

           Sauce                          
 
  Hi again. This recipe was given to me by a chef friend at the Haiku Gardens
  Restaurant in Kaneohe on the Island of Oahu, Hawaii. Have made it often.
  This restaurant is right out of "RAIN"" by Sommerset Maugham. It overlooks
  an awesome valley surrounded by the Koolau mountains. The royalty, Alii,
  used the valley as their exclusive summer hide away from the heat of the
  other side,leeward side, of the Island. I lived very near to it and in the
  Valley for a number of years. Place slivers of garlic along the bones and
  the base of the rack. Salt and pepper all over. Heat small amount of oil in
  a skillet to very hot and quickly brown meaty top side of rack only. Don't
  allow it to cook or burn. Place rack in a baking dish. While oven is
  preheating to 350* to 375*, make sauce. SAUCE: Heat to just below boiling
  point while stirring constantly Use to baste rack and as a sauce to serve
  with it. I usually doubled the recipe to have enough. Place baking dish on
  center rack of preheated oven. Pour 1/2 of the sauce over rack of lamb.
  Cook for about 20+ minutes but usually not more than 25 minutes per pound.
  Serve and accept the ovations from family and friends. BTW, this sauce
  makes a very good barbecue sauce. That's it, after posting these two
  recipes for rack of lamb I am out of here to get one for myself.:):)
  Really. I will post one last one later for you Elaine and other lamb
  lovers. It is nice to be able to get good lamb all year round now.
     Enjoy-----GUY FROM:    GUY ATTWOOD   (NFWF89A)

      Title: Korean Pork or Beef
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     12 ts Pork; tenderloin, slices            2    Green onion;-- scallions, c
           Marinade:                           2 c  Garlic; crushed
    1/2 c  Soy sauce,                          2 pn Ginger; chopped,
    1/4 c  Water,                                   Salt & pepper.
      3 tb Sugar,                         
 
  Preparation: Combine the meat with the marinade and allow the mixture to
  soak for about 2 hours at room temperature, Stir occasionally to make sure
  all of the meat gets well coated. Then take the meat from the marinade and
  dry on paper towels. Be sure to save the marinade. Coat the sides and
  bottom of a baking dish with 2 or 3 Tbs. of Sesame oil and arrange to pork
  in the dish so there is only one layer of the meat. Bake in a pre heated
  oven (375 F) for 50 minutes until the meat is tender. While the meat is
  bak- ing take the marinade and in a sauce pan bring to a boil. When boiling
  reduce the heat to low and cook for approx 15 minutes. The amount should be
  a little reduced.
   When the meat is finished baking pour its cooking juices into the reduced
  marinade and bring the liquid to a boil again. Put the meat on a serving
  dish and pour some of the hot liquid over the pork. The remain- der of the
  hot liquid can be served seperately for those who wish to have more liquid
  on their meat or as a gravy on their rice. Bul-ko-kee: Almost the Korean
  National dish.Very popular in Hawaii and Korean cafes on the US west

      5 tb Soy sauce                      
 
  *boned and cut up in bite sizes. **(Sweet flour made from glutinous rice)
  Mix all of the ingredients with the cut up chicken in a large bowl, stir
  well to coat all of the chicken. Marinate for two or three hours. Fry in a
  large skillet as you would with normal fried chicken until golden brown.
  Drain on paper towels and serve hot. This basic recipe is from the Honpa
  Hongwanji Buddist Temple Cookbook published in Honolulu in 1973. That same
  Buddist temple has since then published an additional four or five
  cookbooks. All of them I am told are very good and offer a wide selection
  of island cooking covering all of the ethnic groups in Hawaii not only the
  Japanese-Hawaiians. Hawaii is a melting pot of races and it is also a
  melting pot of cuisines with each of its many ethnic groups contributing to
  the rich experience of Hawaiian foods. The island housewives "cook in many
  languages" and I indeed enjoyed, and still do enjoy, "eating in many
  languages" I hope this is the recipe you wanted Vicki. If not just send a
  message this way and I will attempt to get just what you wish.

 Categories: Fish/sea
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Salt Salmon                         1    Medium yellow onion; chopped
      5    Large ripe tomatoes                 8    Green onions
 
  I usually scoop the tomato insides out with a large melon baller attempting
  to keep the outside shell of the tomato as intact as possible. Dice the
  removed insides and place the diced tomatoes and their shells in the
  refrigerator while proceeding with the recipe. Soak the salt salmon after
  cleaning. Change the soaking water occasionally to drain off most of the
  salt. After 3 to 5 hours of soaking remove all of the skin and the bones.
  Cut the salmon into small pieces and placed in a bowl. Add the diced
  tomatoes and also add the yellow onion which has been chopped into fairly
  small pieces. Cover the mixture with ice cubes until ready to serve. Chop
  the green onions very small and place them on top of the tomato mixture
  that you will place in the tomato shells to serve. Just as you serve the
  shells add a little crushed ice. FROM: THEODORE SEDGWICK (XPST31A)

    1/4 c  Butter                              2 tb Butter for topping
    1/2 ts Salt                                     Paprika
 
  Bring wine and lemon juice to boil and add scallops, mushrooms, and green
  pepper. Simmer just until scallops are tender. Be careful not to
  overcook!!! Drain, reserving liquid. Melt butter in saucepan, blending in
  salt, pepper, and flour until bubbly. Gradually stir in reserved liquid and
  cook until thickened. Add Swiss cheese and 1/2 of the Romano and stir over
  very low heat until blended. Remove from heat and fold in whipped cream.
  Stir in scallop mixture, then divide between eight, individual, buttered
  scallop shells/baking dishes. Sprinkle tops with remaining Romano, dot with
  butter and sprinkle with pap- rika. Broil until golden brown. Watch them
  carefully so as not to burn!!!! This, as you may guess, is sinfully rich
  and deliciously bad for you. Scallops themselves, however, are very low in
  cholesterol. If you would also like to try some plainer, New England-style
  scallop recipes, just let me know. Yours in good food and good fellowship!

  just golden brown and crispy,then turn and let second side get golden.Be
  careful when turning not to break the buttermilk crust.

  is not too high and chicken does not brown to fast. Remove lid and turn
  pieces over once more.Turn heat up-but not too high-- and cook a few
  minutes longer until crust is crisped. If crust on the sides of the breast
  is still soft and mushy,turn those pieces on their side in the oil for a
  minute or two so they can fry up crisp. Makes 6 servings.

  your own soups.  Much lower in fat and salt than the canned versions. The
  trick is to have it made up ready to use!    Combine all ingredients,
  mixing well.  Store in an airtight container until ready to use. To
  SUBSTITUTE FOR ONE CAN OF CONDENSED SOUP: Combine 1/3 cup of dry mix with 1
  1/4 cups of cold water in a saucepan.  Cook and stir until thickened. Add
  to casseroles as you would the canned product. Makes equivalent of 9 cans

     12    Fresh basil leaves; chopped       1/2 c  Fresh Parmesan; grated
 
  Earlier in the day, add enough water to the skinned chicken to cover it.
  Poach chicken in simmering water (uncovered) until chicken is no longer
  pink. This will take about 8 minutes. Allow chicken to cool in poaching
  liquid. (I put it in the refrig. rather than leave it at room temp. Cooling
  it in the liquid makes it more tender) Later, remove chicken from poaching
  liquid and chop it into small or bite-size pieces. Save the poaching liquid
  to add to the water you're going to cook the pasta in. In large non-stick
  pan, cook the onion and garlic in heated olive oil until softened. Add hot
  pepper flakes and tomatoes and juice. Cook about 30 minutes over med. heat
  until sauce thickens. Cook penne in poaching liquid with additional water
  as needed. Combine chicken with the sauce mixture in serving bowl. Add
  parsley and cheese. Sprinkle with parmesan and serve immediately. Judy

      Title: Overnight Hashed Brown Potatoe Casserole
 Categories: Vegetables, Casseroles
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      2 lb Frozen hashed brown potatoes        8 oz Chedder cheese; shredded
    1/4 lb Butter                              1    Onion; grated
      1 pt Sour cream                        3/4 c  Milk* (optional)
      1 cn Mushroom soup                  
 
  Cut butter into potatoes.  Mix rest of ingred. together; pour over top of
  potatoes.  Toss.  *1/4 - 3/4 c. milk can be used in place of one-half of
  the sour cream. It will make a moister casserole, if desired. Bake in a
  13x9" pan @ 350 for 1/2 hr covered and an additional 1/2 hr. uncovered. I
  have used Cheddar Cheese soup, but reduce the butter as it will be greasy
  with both.  I also put additional shredded cheese on top during the second
  half hour of baking. Doubles well. Can be refrigerated overnight after
  mixing all together. TSPN00B-LISA CRAWLEY
