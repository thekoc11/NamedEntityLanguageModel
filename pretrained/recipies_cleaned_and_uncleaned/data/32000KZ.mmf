 Categories: Soups, Breads, Russian, Holiday, Ethnic
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      5 c  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Butter
      1 c  Evaporated Milk
    1/2 c  Water as needed
 
  * Do not use Condensed milk in this recipe
  
  Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl, forming a well in the
  middle. Add the butter and milk and mix lightly until the flour is
  absorbed. (Add a little warm water as needed.) Knead until the dough
  sticks together, cover and allow to rest for a few minutes, then
  knead until smooth. Cover and set aside. Place the dough in a lightly
  oiled bowl, turn, and cover for about 1/2 . Place 1/4 of the dough on
  a floured work surface, re-covering the rest of the dough.  Roll into
  a circle, starting at the center and rolling outwards to maintain an
  even thickness, turn over and from the center, roll the dough out to
  about 1/8-inch thickness. Run a hand under the bottom to loosen it.
  With a 3" biscuit cutter or a glass, cut into rounds. When done
  cutting, place 1 T of the filling on one side of each, flipping the
  other half over the top and sealing with your fingers or a fork. Be
  sure to seal these well. Place each of the dumplings on a floured
  cooky sheet, keeping the dumplings covered with a towel. Repeat with
  the remaining dough, saving the scraps until last. Use as little
  flour as possible in this process or the scraps will be come tough
  and heavy. Gently drop 12 to 15 varenyky into 3 quarts of boiling
  water, in a large Dutch oven. Do not overcrowd. Stir and cook for
  about 3 - 4 minutes. Drain in a collander and place on a lightly
  oiled cookies sheet, shaking to coat with a thin film to prevent
  sticking. Do not pile the dumplings on top of each other. If the
  varenyky are to be frozen, remove with a slotted spoon when they
  float to the top. DO NOT overcook. To freeze. Place in the freezer on
  an oiled cookie sheet when they are at room temp.. When they are
  frozen hard, store in tightly sealed plastic bags. Varenyky may be
  poached, pan-fried or steamed, served as an accompaniment with meats,
  or served with sour cream, chopped sauteed onions, plain yogurt,

      2 tb Butter
      1 c  Evaporated Milk; NOT
           -Condensed Milk
    1/2 c  ;Water, As Needed
 
  Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl, forming a well in the
  middle. Add the butter and milk and mix lightly until the flour is
  absorbed. (Add a little warm water as needed.) Knead until the dough
  sticks together, cover and allow to rest for a few minutes, then
  knead until smooth. Cover and set aside.  (This dough should be
  somewhat soft, since more flour will be added as the dough is rolled
  out.) Or, in a processor, combine the flour, salt, and butter,
  stirring a few times, then with the machine running, add liquids
  until a ball forms. Allow to rest for a few minutes and then process
  until smooth. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turn, and
  cover for about 30 minutes. (It may be wrapped in plastic and
  refrigerated for a day or so, brought to room temperature and then
  rolled out.) Place a fourth of the dough on a floured work surface,
  re-covering the rest of the dough.  Roll into a circle, starting at
  the center and rolling outwards to maintain an even thickness, turn
  over and again from the center, roll the dough out to about 1/8-inch
  thickness. Run a hand under the bottom to loosen it.  With a 3-inch
  biscuit cutter or wine glass, cut into rounds. When done cutting,
  place 1 tb of the filling on one side of each, flipping the other
  half over the top and sealing with your fingers or a fork. Make sure
  each is sealed or the filling will come out when cooked. Place each
  of the dumplings on a floured cookie sheet, keeping the dumplings
  covered with a towel.  Repeat with the remaining dough, saving the
  scraps until last. Use as little flour as possible in this process or
  the scraps will be come tough and heavy.  Gently drop 12 to 15
  varenyky into 3 quarts of boiling water, in a large wide pot or Dutch
  oven. Do NOT overcrowd. Stir and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes. Drain
  in a collander and place on a lightly oiled cookies sheet, shaking to
  coat with a thin film to prevent sticking. Do NOT pile the dumplings
  on top of each other as this distorts their shape. If the varenyky
  are to be frozen, remove with a slotted spoon when they float to the
  top. DO NOT overcook. To freeze. place in the freezer on an oiled
  cookie sheet when tepid (lukewarm). When they are rigid, store in
  tightly sealed plastic bags. TO SERVE: Varenyky may be poached,
  pan-fried or steamed, served as an accompaniment or meats or served
  with sour cream, chopped sauteed onions or fried bacon with a little
  bacon fat.

MMMMM------------------------NOODLE DOUGH-----------------------------
      4 c  Flour
           Salt
      4 lg Egg yolk

      4 lg Egg white; lightly beaten
      8 tb Butter, sweet

MMMMM-----------------------POTATO FILLING----------------------------
      6 tb Butter, sweet
      1 md Onion; finely chopped
      3 lg Potato; peel/boil/mashed
    1/4 lb Farmer's cheese
      2 oz Colby; grated
           Salt & pepper; to taste

MMMMM---------------------SAUERKRAUT FILLING--------------------------
      3 sl Bacon; diced
      1 lg Onion; chopped
  3 1/2 c  Sauerkraut, packaged*
  1 1/2 tb Tomato paste
      2 ts Sugar
    1/3 c  Chicken broth
 
  *Rinse kraut and squeeze thoroughly dry.
  
  Dumplings:  In a food processor, blend the flour and 1/2 teaspoon
  salt. With the motor running, add the egg yolks and the oil through
  the feed tube, then pour in the water, in a slow, steady stream,
  until the dough forms a ball around the blade.  Transfer the dough to
  a floured surface and knead until smooth, about two minutes. Cover
  with a linen or cotton (not terry) kitchen towel and let stand half
  an hour.
  
  Divide the dough in half and shape into two balls. Keep one ball
  covered with the towel.  On a floured surface with a floured rolling
  pin, roll out the dough to a very thin sheet, about 1/16" thick,
  making sure it doesn't tear.  With a round cookie cutter, cut out
  circles about 3" in diameter. Gather the scraps together into a ball
  and set aside, covered.
  
  Have a bowl with the egg white by you.  Place a heaping teaspoon of
  the desired filling in the middle of each circle. Fold the dough over
  the filling to form a semi-circle. Brush the edges with the egg white
  and press the edges firmly together with the tines of a fork to seal.
  Place the vareniki as they are made on a lightly floured large baking
  sheet about 1" apart and keep covered with a damp tea towel. When
  finished with the first batch, roll out the second ball of dough and
  make a second batch. Add the leftover scraps of dough to the scraps
  left from the first batch, knead into a ball, and roll out for a
  final batch of varenyky.
  
  Meanwhile, in a large pot, bring 6 quarts of salted water to a boil.
  Reduce the heat to medium so the water simmers and carefully lower
  half the varenyky into the water. Boil, stirring occasionally with a
  wooden spoon to prevent sticking, until they rise to the surface and
  are cooked through, six to seven minutes. With a slotted spoon,
  carefully remove the varenyky to a colander and drain thoroughly.
  Transfer to a deep serving bowl and toss with half the butter. Repeat
  for the second half of the varenyky.
  
  Potato filling:  Melt the butter in a small skilled over medium heat.
  Add the onion and saut#, stirring occasionally, until nicely browned,
  about 15 minutes. Remvoe from heat and cool slightly. In a large
  bowl, combine the potatoes and cheese.  Add the saut#ed onion along
  with the melted butter and mix well. Season with salt and pepper and
  use for filling the varenyky.
  
  Sauerkraut filling:  Saut# the bacon in a large skillet over medium
  heat until it renders its fat. Remove the bacon and reserve. Drain
  off all but two tablespoons fat. Add the onion to the skillet and
  saut#, stirring frequentlly over medium heat until nicely browned,
  almost 15 minutes. Turn the heat up to medium-high, add the kraut,
  and saut#, stirring, until softened and cooked throughout, 10 to 15
  minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, sugar, and broth.  Reduce the heat
  to low, then cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove from the heat
  and cool to room temperature before using to fill the varenyky. Use
  the reserved bacon as topping.

      Title: VASILOPITA (NEW YEAR BREAD)
 Categories: Greek, Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      1 pk Active dry yeast
    3/4 c  Milk; lukewarm
      3    Eggs; beaten
  1 1/2 ts Grated orange rind
    3/4 c  Caster sugar
  4 1/2 c  Plain flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ground masticha
    1/2 c  Butter; melted
      1    Egg; for glazing
           Blanched split almonds
 
  New Year Bread is traditionally cut at midnight on New Year's Eve.
  After baking, a coin is inserted through a slit in the base. The
  person who finds the coin will have luck in the New Year. Long ago
  the coin used to be a gold one, then later a silver coin was used.
  These could be incorporated into the dough before baking. Nowadays
  because of the nickel content of coins it is undesirable to bake a
  coin in the cake.
  
  Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup of the milk.  Add remainder of milk, eggs,
  orange rind and sugar.  Sift 3 cups flour, salt and spice into a warm
  bowl and make a well in the centre. Pour in yeast mixture and stir to
  blend in flour, gradually adding warm melted butter. Mix dough with
  hands until it comes away from sides. Turn on to a floured surface
  and knead until smooth and elastic, adding remaining flour as
  required. Knead for 10 minutes. Place ball of dough in a clean bowl
  brushed with melted butter. Turn dough over to coat top with butter
  and cover bowl with a cloth or plastic wrap. Leav to prove (rise) in
  a warm place until doubled in bulk. Punch down and turn on to lightly
  floured surface. Knead lightly and shape into a round loaf.  Place on
  a large greased baking sheet or in a greased 25 cm (10 inch) deep
  cake tin.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled - about 1
  1/2 to 2 hours.
  
  Glaze with well-beaten egg and arrange blanched almonds in numbers to
  denote the New Year, pressing in lightly. Bake in a moderately hot
  oven for 45 minutes until golden brown and cooked when tested. If
  bread browns too quickly place a piece of greased brown paper on top.
  Cool on a wire rack.

      1 ds Tabasco
           Freshly ground black pepper,
           -coarsely ground
           Salt to taste
     12 oz Pasta - preferably rotini,
           -cooked al dente
 
  *DIRECTIONS*
  
  Bring veal chops to room temperature.  Season with freshly ground
  coarse black pepper on both sides, pressing pepper into chops. Melt
  butter and olive oil in large, deep-sided frying pan. Brown chops on
  medium-high heat until well browned, about 5 minutes per side. Remove
  and cover with plastic wrap to keep warm.
  
  Add chopped shallots to frying pan and saute, stirring occasionally,
  about 3 minutes. Add garlic and continue sauteeing, stirring
  constantly, another minute or so. Add sliced mushrooms and saute for
  1 to 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium and add
  sun-dried tomatoes, chopped tomatoes, anchovy paste, Tabasco, basil,
  red wine and 1/2 cup reserved tomato juice. Cook on medium heat
  UNCOVERED approximately 15 minutes. If sauce gets too thick, thin
  with remaining tomato juice, keeping in mind the fact that the pasta
  will thin sauce slightly. Taste and correct seasoning, adding more
  basil if desired along with salt and black pepper. Add veal chops to
  sauce mixture, along with any meat juices that have accumulated on
  plate, sinking chops as best as possible. Cook UNCOVERED about 10
  minutes, and then flip chops. Cook another 5 minutes UNCOVERED and
  again remove chops to plate and cover with plastic wrap to keep warm.
  (Do not overcook the veal!)
  
  Add cooked pasta to sauce and heat on medium-low about 5 minutes,
  stirring occasionally, until pasta is warm. Taste and correct
  seasoning.
  
  Serve pasta on large platter with veal chops and sprinkle freshly
  grated imported Romano on top of pasta.
  
  Serves 4.
  
  Serve with Caesar Salad or Spinach Salad and garlic bread. Something
  lemony would be great for dessert, like Lemon Ice or Lemon Cheesecake.

      Title: VEAL MARSALA WITH PROVOLONE
 Categories: Meats, Italian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Veal cutlets
           Flour
           Salt & pepper
      2 tb Butter
      2 tb Olive oil
      4    Mushrooms, fresh, sliced
    1/2 c  Marsala wine
      4 tb Butter, cold
           Provolone cheese, sliced
 
  Pound veal cutlets between sheets of waxed paper til about 1/4" thick.
   Combine flour and salt & papper to taste.  Dredge cutlets in the
  flour mixture.  Combine 2 Tbsp butter with the 2 Tbsp olive oil in a
  large frying pan over medium high heat. Cook cutlets until lightly
  browned- about 2-3 minutes per side.  Remove cutlets to a platter or
  pan suitable for use under a broiler. Place sliced mushrooms in the
  frying pan and cook until tender, adding a little butter if needed.
  Add Marsala and reduce sauce to about half of the original volume.
  Pre-heat broiler. Lower heat under the frying pan to VERY low, or
  place pan in a larger pan of hot water. Whisk in cold butter, 1 Tbsp
  at a time, adding each just before the last is completely
  incorporated. Remove sauce from heat immediately when done. Place a
  slice of provolone on each cutlet and broil until cheese bubbles and
  just starts to brown. Serve sauce alongside the cutlets, or spoon
  over as they are served. (This type of sauce will separate if it
  becomes too hot at any point- mine always does :) ).
  
  Other ideas:  Use chicken in place of veal.  Place a slice of
  prosciutto on the chicken or veal, then the slice of cheese before
  broiling.

      Title: VEAL PICATTA (PITTS)
 Categories: Veal
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Boneless veal cutlets
           Flour seasoned with
           Salt and lemon pepper
           Dry white wine
           Chicken broth
           Olive oil or clarified
           Butter for frying
           Fresh lemon juice
           Pepper & oregano for taste
 
  Heat oil or butter in a large frying pan until it develops a
  fragrance. Meanwhile, pound the cutlets lightly (do not break the
  meat), and dip in the seasoned flour.
  
  Pop the cutlets into the pan (in batches if necessary, do not
  overcrowd the pan), and brown on both sides. Remove from the pan and
  keep warm.
  
  Pour off the excess fat, leaving just a thin film, and the brown bits
  on the bottom of the pan.  Add a healthy glug of wine, and stir
  wildly until the browned bits come off the bottom and begin to
  dissolve. Add chicken broth, and continue cooking, stirring, until
  reduced by half (you only want a couple of tablespoons of sauce per
  serving). Add the juice of a fresh lemon, salt, pepper and oregano to
  taste. Pour the sauce over the cutlets, and serve.
  
  We like this with pasta dressed with a little butter or olive oil and
  Parmesan cheese, and a steamed green vegetable.
  
  Sorry there are no quantities here -- I just toss stuff in the general
  direction of the saute pan and keep cooking until it looks right.
  
  If you really want to get fancy, cut a lemon into thin slices and use
  the slices to garnish the meat.  A sprinkling of parsley wouldn't hurt
  anything, either....

      Title: VEAL PICCATA WITH LEMON & CAPERS
 Categories: Veal
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 tb Butter, unsalted; room temp
  2 1/2 tb Butter, unsalted; chilled &
           -cut into pieces
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 lb Veal scaloppine, pounded
           -very thin (1/16")
           Salt; to taste
           Pepper, white
    1/4 c  Lemon juice
      2 ts Capers; drained
      2 ts Parsley, fresh; chopped
           Lemon slices; for garnish
 
  In a large nonreactive skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of the room-temper-
  ature butter in 1 tablespoon of the oil over high heat. When the fat
  is very hot, after about 3 minutes, lightly season a few slices of
  the veal with salt and pepper.  Add just enough veal to fit
  comfortably in the pan and cook until just browned, about 30 seconds
  per side. Transfer the veal to a large platter.  Season and cook the
  remaining veal in batches, adding the remaining oil and 1 tablespoon
  room-temperature butter to the skillet as necessary.
  
  When all the veal has been browned, pour the wine into the pan and
  stir to deglaze, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom. Cook
  until the wine has reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Add the lemon
  juice and cook for 30 seconds longer.  Remove from the heat and stir
  in the 2-1/2 tablespoons chilled butter to make a smooth sauce. Add
  the capers and season with salt and pepper to taste. Add any
  accumulated juices from the meat, then pour the sauce over the veal.
  Sprinkle the parsley on top, garnish with lemon slices and serve at
  once.
  
  Note:  They note that homemade chicken stock could be used in place
  of the wine to deglaze the pan.

 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 tb Bacon fat or salad oil
      2    Garlic cloves, cut in half
      1    Veal - 1/2 leg or:
           -3 or 4 lb rolled shoulder

      1 ts Salt

      1    Bay leaf
      6    Potatoes - medium (6-8)
      6    Onions - medium (6-8)
 
  Melt or heat bacon fat or oil in cast iron saucepan. Stuff the 2
  cloves of garlic, cut in two, into incisions made in the veal. Place
  the meat in the hot fat and brown well on all sides. Don't rush this
  as the colour and flavour of the finished gravy will depend on how
  well the meat has been browned. Add the thyme or savory and the bay
  leaf. Place the potatoes and onions, whole around the meat. Don't add
  any liquid. Cover tightly and cook over medium heat till meat is
  tender, about 2 hours. The potatoes and oniions will not break as
  there is no liquid added. The veal will make its own gravy. When
  cooked, remove the meat from the pan to a heated platter. Place the
  pan over high heat and stir gently, so as not to break up the
  vegetables. When they are well coated with gravy, boil another
  minutes or so till the gravy has a nice consistency. This is a
  complete meal.

  Unless the scallopine are very small, cut them into pieces measuring
  ab. 3 in. by 3 in or slightly larger. Place them between sheets of
  wax paper and pound lightly to flatten.(use a rolling pin, bottom of
  a heavy skillet, pounder, etc.) Blend flour with salt and pepper to
  taste. Dip the meat into flour to coat lightly. Using a large, heavy
  skillet, heat the butter and oil and when it is very hot but not
  brown, add the meat in one layer. Cook over relatively high heat
  until golden brown on one side. Turn and cook until golden brown on
  the other. The cooking time should be from 4-6 min. Transfer meat to
  a serving platter or two plates and keep warm. To the skillet add the
  wine and stir to dissolve the particles in the pan. Reduce wine
  slightly and pour equal amounts over each serving. Naturally, these

 Categories: Italian, Meats
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    1/2 lb Scallopine of veal, cut
           Into 1/4 inch slices
           Flour for dredging
           Salt
           Freshly ground Pepper
      2 tb Butter
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/4 c  Marsala wine
 
  Unless the scaloppine are very small, cut them into pieces measuring
  ab. 3 in. by 3 in or slightly larger. Place them between sheets of
  wax paper and pound lightly to flatten.(use a rolling pin, bottom of
  a heavy skillet, pounder, etc.) Blend flour with salt and pepper to
  taste. Dip the meat into flour to coat lightly. Using a large, heavy
  skillet, heat the butter and oil and when it is very hot but not
  brown, add the meat in one layer. Cook over relatively high heat
  until golden brown on one side. Turn and cook until golden brown on
  the other. The cooking time should be from 4-6 min. Transfer meat to
  a serving platter or two plates and keep warm. To the skillet add the
  wine and stir to dissolve the particles in the pan. Reduce wine
  slightly and pour equal amounts over each serving. Naturally, these
  amts. may be increased to serve more people. For Chicken marsala, I
  don't see why you can't substitute chicken breasts.

      Title: VEAL STIFADO
 Categories: Greek, Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
      2 tb Olive oil
  1 1/2 lb Lean veal; in 1-1/2" cubes
      2    Garlic cloves
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
    1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
      2 tb Dry red wine
      3    Peeled tomatoes; chopped
      1 lg Bay leaf
      1 tb White or brown sugar
  1 1/2 lb Small white onions; peeled
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      2 tb Butter; cut into bits
      1    Cinnamon stick
      3    Whole cloves
 
  In a baking-serving casserole, heat the oil, then add the veal and
  saute on all sides.  Add the garlic and season with salt and pepper.
  Stir with a wooden spoon, then add the vinegar, wine, tomatoes, bay
  leaf, sugar, and enough water to cover the veal.  Arrange the onions
  over the meat, sprinkle the parsley and butter bits over the top, and
  slip the spices in between the meat and the onions.  Shake the
  casserole a few times, then cover with an inverted plate to keep in
  place and cover tightly with a lid (using a little flour-water paste
  around the inside of the lid to seal if you wish). Bake in a slow
  oven (300 F) for 2 to 2-1/2 hours or over minimum heat on a burner,
  until the veal and onions are tender. Remove from the heat and serve
  warm. Note: After peeling the onions, pierce the root end of each
  onion with the tip of a small, sharp knife, then slash again at a
  right angle to make a cross. This will keep the onion whole and
  intact during the cooking process.

  Transfer the liquid to the stock pot and add enough cold water to
  cover. Bring slowly to a boil, skimming off all of the froth that
  forms. Lower the heat and add tomatoes, thyme, bay leaves, cloves and
  salt. Simmer uncovered for 6 to 8 hours adding water as necessary
  just to cover the ingredients. Skim whenever necessary.  Add
  peppercorns for the last 15 minutes of the simmering.  Strain the
  "soup" into a large bowl through a colander lined with a double layer
  of dampened cheesecloth. Gently press the solids to extract all of
  the liquid, and discard the solids. Pour the stock into containers
  for storage and label and date them. The stock will "keep" for up to
  3 days in a refrigerator, and up to 6 months in a freezer.

  cloves of garlic, cut in two, into incisions made in the veal. Place
  the meat in the hot fat and brown well on all sides. Don't rush this
  as the colour and flavour of the finished gravy will depend on how
  well the meat has been browned. Add the thyme or savory and the bay
  leaf. Place the potatoes and onions, whole around the meat. Don't add
  any liquid. Cover tightly and cook over medium heat till meat is
  tender, about 2 hours. The potatoes and oniions will not break as

  cooked, remove the meat from the pan to a heated platter. Place the
  pan over high heat and stir gently, so as not to break up the
  vegetables. When they are well coated with gravy, boil another
  minutes or so till the gravy has a nice consistency. This is a

      Title: VEG-BURGER MIX
 Categories: Vegetables, Sandwiches, Main dish
      Yield: 12 Burgers
 
    1/2 c  Dry Garbanzo Beans
    1/2 c  Dry soybeans
    1/2 c  Dry lentils
    1/2 c  Yellow split peas
    1/2 c  Instant brown rice
    1/2 c  Rolled oats
      1 pk Dry soup mix or
           Salad dressing mix
    1/4 c  Bread crumbs
    1/4 c  Cornmeal
  1 1/2 ts Baking soda
 
  Put the ingredients one by one in a blender.  Turn on the blender.
  Run for cover (it's pretty noisy).  When everything is reduced to
  powder, combine in a container. To use, mix 1 cup of the mix with 2/3
  cup HOT water or combination of water and BBQ sauce, water and wine,
  or whatever other liquids you can think of. Let sit 15 minutes, then
  form into 3 patties. Cook in a pan coated with nonstick spray. NOTE:
  If you use BBQ sauce as part of the liquid, they will brown much
  faster - must be the sugar in the sauce.  This recipe makes 4 cups of
  dry mix.
  
  The variations for this are endless, as you can use different dry
  mixes. Good Seasons makes fat free dry salad dressing mixes, and
  there are lots of different flavors of soup mix (I think onion soup
  would be good). You could also use the dry seasoning mixes, like the
  taco seasoning, etc. Some of these are fairly high in sodium, but I
  would think that in a quantity of mix, it would average out to an
  acceptable level.

      2 tb Frozen apple juice
      1 c  Unbleached flour
 
  Pastry for "free form pies" (you wrap the big piece of pastry up over
  the top)
  
  Mix together soymilk, potatoes, syrup or honey, and yeast in a medium
  bowl or a food processor bowl. Let stand 5 minutes. Add salt and
  flours. If using a food processor, process 30 seconds. Otherwise, mix
  and knead mixture on a lightly floured surface 5 minutes.
  
  (It says here to place in oiled bowl and oil top lightly, but I think
  we can figure out alternatives.) Cover and let rise until doubled,
  about an hour. Dough can also be allowed to rise in the 'fridge 2-24
  hours.

  Comment by Judy Karpen, karpen@nrlfs1.nrl.navy.mil:
  
  Good stuff!
  
  Just a variant note -- shredded carrot can be used in addition to, or
  even in place of, the cabbage; also, raspberry vinegar (tres yuppie,
  i know) can replace the cider vinegar + honey. If it's still not
  sweet enough for your taste you can add some fruit juice; peach works
  well. Oh, you can leave out the oil too, esp if you add the fruit
  juice (dont want too much liquid in there).

      1 tb Minced fresh garlic
      1 lg Onion, chopped

      1    15oz can Great Northern

      1    15oz can Black-eyed peas,
           Rinsed and drained
    1/2 c  Nutritional yeast
      2 ts Dried oregano leaves
    3/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Fresh ground pepper
      2    Tomatoes, chopped
 
  Combine water, tomato paste, and garlic in very large soup pot. Add
  onion, eggplant and mustard greens. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and
  simmer, uncovered, until eggplant is tender, but firm (about 15
  minutes).
  
  Combine 2 cups of the soup broth (from pot), the can of Great Northern
  beans, the nutritional yeast, and the seasonings in a blender. Process
  until very smooth. Pour into soup pot and mix well. Stir in black-eyed
  peas, and tomatoes.  Simmer, uncovered, until the beans are heated
  and the tomatoes softened.
  
  This would probably be really good with cauliflower instead of
  eggplant, too.  Mmmm and maybe zucchini.

      Title: VEGAN LONDON BROIL
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 6oz steaks
 
  2 1/2 lb Raw Seitan
           - (2 boxes Seitan Quick Mix)
    1/2 ga Water
  1 1/2 c  Tamari soy sauce
      1    7-inch strip kombu
           -- (sea vegetable)
      6 sl Fresh ginger (thin slices)
           Sauce
           -- (such as Bordelaise
           -- or Miso sauces)
 
  Prep time: 30 minutes
  
  Place Seitan in an 8-inch square cake pan.  Allow to rest until it
  takes the shape of the pan.  Place this pan inside a second, larger
  pan that is half-filled with water. Cover the larger pan. Bake in a
  pre-heated oven at 375 F. for 1 hour.  When Seitan is done, remove
  from the pan. Divide into eight equal pieces. To 1/2 gallon water,
  add tamari, kombu, ginger, and Seitan steaks.  Cover pot, bring to a
  simmer, and cook for about 45 minutes.  (If you are using a pressure
  cooker, reduce liquid by one half and cook for 20 to 25 minutes). You
  may leave steaks in the stock for several hours, if you wish.  Remove
  steaks from stock and drain. Brush with a little sauce, and broil so
  they will be lightly browned. Serve steaks hot with additional sauce.
  
  This recipe has been developed by Bro. Ron Pickarski as part of his
  work toward being a participant and finalist in the Culinary Olympics
  held in Frankfurt, Germany.

  golden brown. The top will be firm, but inside will still be liquidy
  ~ this is OK, as it cools to a pate-like consistency. Refrigerate and
  serve cold. Use this on crackers, or as a spread for sandwiches. Hope
  you like it. It also seems that we could get some interesting flavor

      Title: VEGAN SNOWY MOUNTAIN
 Categories: Desserts, Tofu, Fruits, Cakes, Mark's
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/2 ea Chocolate cake, see recipe
      2 tb Malibu*
      2 ea Oranges, peeled & diced
    1/2 c  Tofu
      3 tb Rum**
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Lemon juice
    1/2 c  Coconut, shredded
 
  For this recipe, you need 1/2 of the chocolate cake recipe, so freeze
  half or set aside for future use.
  
  Roughly cut up the chocolate cake into good bite-sized pieces & place
  in a medium sized serving dish.  Soak with the malibu. Arrange the
  chopped oranges over the cake. Set aside.
  
  In a food processor or blender, blend the tofu until smooth. Add the
  remaining ingredients & blend until well mixed. Spread over the top
  of the cake & oranges. Chill until ready to serve.
  
  * I liked the coconut-pineapple taste that the malibu provided, you
  could use orange juice in place if you desire.
  
  ** Use some rum extract instead of rum & reduce the amount. Or use a
  fruit juice that might combine well with coconut but that is clear,
  otherwise the topping will look a funny colour.
  
  VARIATIONS: Use canned fruits, fruit salads or other fresh fruits of
  your choice.  I find that naturally juicy fruits work the best.
  
  Use a plain sponge cake instead of the chocolate cake.
  
  Garnish with strawberries or kiwis before serving.

      Title: VEGAN YOGURT
 Categories: Vegetarian, Low-cal, Low-fat
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           Allow 5 min to prepare
           1-2 days to ferment
           To make 1 Pt. 6 - 1/2 C Svg
  3 1/2 tb Starter culture
      1 pt Soya milk
 
  Directions:
    Divide the starter culture equally between 2 or 3 storage jars (jam
  jars are ideal) then fill each jar with soya milk, seal and shake
  vigorously.
    Place in the refrigerator till fermented (1-2) days.
                        ------- Each 100 g provides: 52 Cal, 3 g pro, 2
  g fat, 2 g carb 1 g fiber
                        ------- Note that this simple method will only
  work with the opportunistic culture that occasionally arrives to
  thicken an uncovered jug of soya milk that has been in use for a day
  or two. Of course, once you've got some and made your first batch,
  you can reserve 2-3 table- spoonsful as a starter for the next.
    Also note that the very first batch you make will be little more
  than a thickened, mildly flavored milk, but the taste will gradually
  strengthen and the texture gradually thicken from batch to batch. If
  you want to strengthen the taste of the batch you have at hand,
  simply stir in a little lemon juice.
    With this method there is no need to keep the jars warm during
  fermentation -- once you've filled and shaken them you can simply put
  them in the fridge to ferment and forget about them for a day or two.
    This yogurt is excellent poured over breakfast cereals, fresh fruit
  and puddings, or stirred into soups, just before serving. It's also
  all right for making Lassi though you'll probably need to add a
  little lemon juice as already mentioned.

 Categories: Vegetarian, Puddings
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Grated apples
           Juice of 1 lemon
      4 c  Whole grain bread, cubed,
           -small
    1/3 c  Raisins
      1 ts Cinnamon
  1 1/2 c  Soymilk
    1/2 c  Maple syrup
           Some vanilla if you use
           -plain soymilk
           Egg replacer to equal
           -one egg
 
  Mix lemon juice with grated apple. Blend the soymilk, egg replacer,
  maple syrup and cinnamon (and vanilla, if you use it) together. Put
  one third of the bread in the bottom of a greased 8" by 8" baking
  dish and cover with 1 cup of the apples and half the raisins.  Pour
  one cup of the liquid mixture over these ingredients. Repeat the
  layers of bread, apple and raisins, ending with a top layer of bread.
  Pour the rest of the liquid ingredients over it.  Sprinkle with
  cinnamon. Let pudding sit for a few minutes (original recipes called
  for 20 minutes, I let it sit for 5). Bake, covered, at 350 degrees F
  (325 if you use a glass dish) for 45 minutes. Let stand for 10 to 20
  minutes at room temperature before serving. Was great for breakfast.
  
  Notes: I used a whole wheat cinnamon raisin bread, which combined
  with the vanilla soymilk and maple syrup made it fairly sweet, which
  I like but others might not. The orginal recipe called for margerine
  to be dotted on top before baking. I cut it out because of fat
  considerations, but I guess it would make the top crisper. Heavily
  adapted from a recipe in the original Laurel's Kitchen.  It creates a
  soft, moist, but yummy pudding. This was my first attempt to veganize
  a baked recipe, and I think it turned out fairly well. Debbie

      Title: VEGAN: CABBAGE KIMCHEE
 Categories: None
      Yield: 2 Quarts
 
      1 lb Chinese cabbage
      1 lb White radish
      3 tb Salt
      2 tb Finely minced fresh ginger
  1 1/2 tb Minced garlic
      5    Scallions, cut into fine
           -rounds, including green
      1 tb Cayenne
      1 ts Sugar
 
  If you are using a small, whole cabbage, cut it in half lengthwise,
  and then cut it across at 2-inch intervals. If you are using half of
  a large cabbage, cut it in half again lengthwise, and then crosswise
  at 2-inch intervals.
  
  Peel the white radish, cut it in half lengthwise, and then cut it
  crosswise into 1/8-inch-thick slices.  In a large bowl put 5 cups
  water and 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons of the salt. Mix. Add the
  cabbage and radish to this water and dunk them in a few times as they
  have a tendency to float.  Leave the vegetables in the salty water.
  Cover loosely and set aside for 12 hours. Turn the vegetables over a
  few times.
  
  Put the ginger, garlic, scallions, cayenne, sugar, and 1 teaspoon
  salt in another large bowl.  Mix well.
  
  Take the cabbage out of its soaking liquid with a slotted spoon (save
  the liquid) and put it in the bowl with the seasonings. Mix well.
  
  Put this cabbage mixture into a 2-quart jar or crock. Pour enough of
  the salt water over it to cover the vegetables (about 2 cups). Leave
  1 inch of empty space at the top of the jar. Cover loosely with a
  clean cloth and set aside for 3 to 7 days.  In the summer, kimchees
  mature with much greater speed;  in the winter, the process slows
  down unless the central heating is ferocious.  Taste the pickle after
  3 days to check on the sourness. When it is done to your liking,
  cover the jar and refrigerate.
  
  To serve, remove just as much of the kimchee solids as you think you
  will need for a meal--a cupful is enough for 4 people--and put it in
  the center of a bowl.  The kimchee liquid in this pickle is left
  behind in the jar and may be used to flavor stews and soups.  Serve
  this cabbage kimchee with any Korean meal.
  
  ~- Madhur Jaffrey, _World-of-the-East Vegetarian Cooking_
  
  (Be sure and keep a close eye on the kimchee after the third day. If
  mold appears, scoop out the mold, and refrigerate the kimchee
  immediately).

      Title: VEGAN: CORN TORTILLAS
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Masa harina
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Warm water
 
  With a fork, mix the Masa and salt. Add the water slowly until the
  masa holds together and the water is absorbed evenly. The tortilla
  dough will be moist, but not overly sticky. Divide the dough into 12
  balls (about the size of golf balls). Cover with plastic, as you
  don't want the dough to dry out.
  
  To make the tortillas, take a piece of wax paper and fold it in half.
  Place a ball of dough in between the wax paper. Squish the ball down
  using the bottom of a pie plate (PYREX is best, since you can see
  what's going on). When the tortillas is thin, but not too thin,
  you're done. Do this for all tortillas, layering them with the used
  wax paper sheets so they don't dry out.
  
  Heat a cast iron skillet to _hot_. Tortillas must cook fast else they
  dry out. Cook each tortillas, flipping it several times and
  encoraging steam to form; if you're lucky or skilled the tortilla
  will puff up like a baloon. This should be encouraged by pressing
  lightly on the tortilla with the bottom of a spatula while the
  tortilla is cooking. The steam keeps the tortillas moist and tender.
  The tortilla is done when light brown patches appear on both sides.
  Place the baked tortillas in a towel-lined basket (or use the pie
  plate). Cover with another towel; this steams the tortillas. Colleen

      Title: VEGAN: EASY CHANNA (CHICK PEA CURRY)
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 md Onion, chopped finely
      2    Cloves garlic, chopped
  1 1/2 tb Canola oil
      2 ts INDIAN curry powder
      3 tb Tomato ketchup
     30 oz Can chick peas (garbanzos)
      1 bn Coriander leaves (cilantro),
           -de-stemmed and chopped

MMMMM--------------------------OPTIONAL-------------------------------
           2 inch stick cinnamon
      6    Cloves, crushed
      4    Cardamom pods, crushed
 
  Although this is not absolutely authentic, it's quick (unlike most
  Indian dishes), and easily made for a delicious approximation of the
  real thing. Adding the optional ingredients helps the flavor, but a
  quick-and-dirty onion-garlic-curry powder-ketchup-chick peas version
  isn't too bad, either.
  
  Fry the onions in oil at medium-high heat until golden and
  translucent, 2-3 minutes.  Add garlic, fry for a minute. Add
  cinnamon, cloves and cardamom, fry for a minute (until the kitchen
  begins to smell really good!). Now add the curry powder to the oni
  ons, fry for a minute or two. As the mixture begins to stick, add the
  ketchup to make it more pliable. Keep on frying for about 5 minutes,
  stirring fairly constantly. Once this "base masala" is ready (one
  hint is if the oil starts separating from the mixture), just add the
  chickpeas, including the water they are in. Stir to mix, heat until
  it boils, then cover and lower the heat to medium-low. Cook for 15
  minutes, take off heat and stir in coriander leaves.  Serve hot, with
  heated pita, tortillas, Indian bread (roti, naan or puri) or rice.
  
  NOTE:  McCormick's or other American "curry powder" just isn't as
  good as the powder you can find in Indian stores. In case you are
  finicky and an Indian store isn't easily available, a fair
  approximation can be made with 1/2 tsp.  corinader, 1/2 tsp.  cumin,
  1/2 tsp. turmeric, 1/4-1/2 tsp. hot chile powder.

  centigrade, gas mark 3/4. If you haven`t cooked a vegan cake before
  you might want to practice. Please note, if your BF is vegan, he
  might (or might not) consider honey to be an animal product and
  therefore taboo. Pauline

      Title: VEGAN: MEATLESS LOAF
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 tb Sunflower oil
      2 md Onions, chopped
  4 1/2 oz TVP granules
      1 c  Hot water or vegetable stock
  1 1/2 c  Breadcrumbs
    1/2 tb Mixed herbs
      1 tb Freshly chopped parsley
      2    Cloves crushed garlic
      1    Egg equivalent, well mixed
      2 tb Soy sauce
           Salt and pepper

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
     32 oz Chopped tomatoes
      6 oz Tomato paste
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large saucepan, heat oil and saute
  onions until lightly browned.  Add the TVP mince, stir and cook for
  two minutes. Pour the hot water or stock over the saute and simmer
  for four minutes.
  
  In a separate bowl, mix the breadcrumbs, herbs and garlic together
  with one cup cold water.  Stir in the egg and leave to one side for
  ten minutes.
  
  Combine the cooked TVP mince with the breadcrumbs mixture, then add
  the soy sauce.  Stir well and season to taste. Using your hands,
  shape the mixture into an oval mound and place it in the center of a
  large baking dish, leaving plenty of space all around for the tomato
  sauce to run.
  
  Heat the tomatoes, tomato paste and seasoning in a small saucepan,
  and pour over the loaf, then bake for one hour. Serves 6.
  
  JTK's notes:  I usually add more herbs & chopped garlic, and saute
  chopped vegetables like celery, carrots, and/or mushrooms after
  onions are done but before adding TVP.  Hot sauce is a good addition,
  too, or other flavored sauce like veg.  Worcestershire. The egg
  replacer works fine --- i have no idea what it's like with a real
  egg. Also, I make the tomato sauce differently (sometimes I use
  canned/jar or homemade frozen sauce, usually dont bother heating it
  up first, and I prefer canned whole tomatoes, pureed, to prechopped
  ones), but it doesn't matter much. I make breadcrumbs from whatever
  bread is available, preferably wholewheat (lightly toasted for
  dryness) ~-- doesn't matter much either. Cracker crumbs or matzo meal
  would probably do as well, if you don't have bread around or a food
  processor/blender.  I've made 1.5x recipe into a single loaf OK, but
  larger wouldn't work (would have to make separate loaves, if larger
  quantities are desired)

  2 1/2 c  Rolled oats
     12 oz Ordinary white mushrooms
        x  Large handful of dried
           Shiitake mushrooms
      3 md Onions
      2    Bay leaves
      1 tb Sage
      1 tb Basil
      1 tb Thyme
      3 tb Cornstarch + just enough
           Water to make a smooth
           Paste
      3 tb Dark soy sauce
 
  cook brown rice as you would normally cook brown rice, and allow to
  cool.
  
  simmer onions and herbs in water until onions are soft. remove bay
  leaves. save any broth.
  
  soak shiitake mushrooms in water until they soften. simmer *all*
  mushrooms in mushroom water until the fresh mushrooms are cooked
  through. save mushroom sweat.
  
  in a food processor, process 1/2 of the rice, 2 c. of the oats, and
  all of the other ingredients until there are no big chunks. You may
  have to do two batches depending on the size of your food processor.
  Use mushroom water and onion liquid to keep the food processor happy.
  
  in a large bowl, mix the processed gloop with remaining rice and
  oats. It should be thick enough to form into cohesive patties, but
  not dry. Add a few extra oats if it's too wet, or some liquid if your
  hands don't get a little sticky when handling it.
  
  fry in a light spray of Pam, over low heat, until both sides of the
  patty are brown and crunchy.  about 10 min.
  
  using a larger amount of mushrooms makes it taste even better, but
  then the batter becomes more like thick pancake batter. Still yummy
  though.

  looks just like chili). Add zucchini and bring to boil. Reduce heat
  and simmer 5 minutes.  (Add TVP here if you are using it) Add black
  beans and corn, simmer 5-15 minutes.
  
  I served over brown rice and provided bowls of hot sauce, FF sour
  cream, chopped jalapeno peppers, and chopped onions. I also had a
  loaf of wheat bread and several people ate their chili with that
  instead of the rice.
  
  Yum yum.  I would imagine it's good the next day, maybe next time I'll
  double the recipe so that there will be some left over.

      Title: VEGE-PATE
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Sunflower seeds, ground
    1/2 c  Flour, Whole wheat
    1/2 c  Wheat germ or nutritional
           -yeast
      1 lg Carrot, grated
      1 lg Potato, grated
      1 lg Celery stalk
      2 tb Lemon juice or vinegar
      2 tb Oil
           Onion, fresh or fried
           Salt, pepper, basil
           Thyme, sage or other
 
  Mix it right in a 9 by 9 pan or use a food processor. Bake at 350F for
  about 1 hour or until brown around the edges and firm and dry on top.
  Hand grating the vegetables makes a very course pate. Using the food
  processor makes a very smooth one. Frying the onions gives the pate a
  very different flavour.

      Title: VEGEBURGERS
 Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      8 oz Green lentils
      3    Medium-sized carrots
      3 sl Bread
      1    Onion
      1    Clove garlic
      1 oz Or so parsley (could be
           Omitted, or you could use
           Cilantro)
      1    Egg
           Seasoning to taste
           Little wholemeal flour to
           Coat (may not be necessary)
 
  Boil lentils for 20 minutes in water, drain, and mash gently - not too
  hard, as you want some of them to stay whole. While they are cooking,
  peel and grate the carrots, make the bread into crumbs, and finely
  chop the onion, parsley and garlic.  Mix these and the seasoning with
  the mashed lentils, and bind together with egg. Form into burgers or
  rissoles or whatever you call the things, coat with flour - I still
  don't know if this is necessary - and cook under the grill (broiler)
  for 5 minutes each side. *Tomato sauce made like this: 1 onion 1
  clove garlic 1 tbs tomato puree (paste) 1 tin tomatoes A little extra
  water Seasoning. Microwave onion and garlic for about 3 minutes;
  transfer to saucepan with the tomato puree, stir, add tinned tomatoes
  and a little water, season, bring to the boil and simmer for about 15
  minutes.  If it's a bit liquid, boil harder to reduce - get it to the
  sort of consistency you would like, bearing in mind you have brown
  rice to moisten!

  isn't it?

 Categories: Digest, Nov., Thanksgivin
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Pumpkin (14 or 15 inches in
           Diameter) or 2 smaller ones
      4 tb Sugar
      2 tb Tamari sauce
      1 c  Water
    1/2 lb Fresh shelled chestnuts
    1/4 c  Un-sulfured raisins
    1/4 c  Un-sulfured apricots,
           Chopped
      1    Granny Smith apple, chopped
           (or any tart apple)
    1/2 c  Walnuts, broken but not too
           Small
      1    Stalk celery, chopped
      1 md White onion, chopped
      1 md Red onion, chopped
      1 cn Corn, drained
      1 md Sweet green pepper, chopped
      1 md Sweet red pepper, chopped
      1 md Zucchini squash, chopped
      1 md Yellow squash, chopped
      2 md Fresh jalapeno peppers,
           Seeded and minced
      2 c  Cooked brown basmati rice
    1/4 ts Mace
    1/4 ts Tumeric
           Black pepper
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
      4 tb Tamari sauce
 
  1. Preheat oven to 350F. Wash pumpkin and cut off the top, angle the
  cut so that the top will fit back on more easily, use a big spoon to
  scoop out strings and seeds. Mix sugar and 2 tbs. tamari sauce (you
  can warm them in the microwave so they will mix more easily ) and
  spread evenly over insides of pumpkin. Line the bottom of a large pan
  with single piece of aluminum foil folded over itself 3 or 4 times,
  pour 1 cup water in pan, place top back on pumpkin and place in
  baking pan, cover the pumpkin and the pan with foil. Bake for 20 to
  25 minutes until pumpkin is just starting to become tender, the
  thicker the pumpkin the longer it will take.
  
  2. Steam the nuts for about 15 minutes. Rinse them in cool water and
  slip off the brown skins. Chop chestnuts coarsely.
  
  3. Combine chestnuts with raisins, apricots, apple, walnuts, celery,
  white and red onions, corn, green and red pepper, jalapeno peppers,
  mace, tumeric and rice, mix well. Add the 4 tbs. tamari and mix again.
  
  4. Dust the inside of the pumpkin with the cinnamon. Pack the pumpkin
  with the filling and replace the pumpkin top. Return pan to oven, add
  water to cover the bottom of the pan and bake for 45 to 55 minutes.
  
  5. If you are going to serve the pumpkin on something other then the
  pan it was cooked in BE CAREFUL. The bottom of the pumpkin may be
  VERY soft. Wrap the foil from the bottom of the pan up around the
  pumpkin as you pick it up, this will keep the bottom intact.
  
  When serving this recipe, scrap the inside of the pumpkin with the
  serving spoon and mix the pumpkin into the stuffing.
  
  If you have leftovers do not leave it in the pumpkin. Remove the
  filling and scrape out the pumpkin and store in your refrigerator.
  Tastes great the day after.

      Title: VEGETABLE AMARANTH (HIN CHOY)
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           Amaranth (hin choy)
 
  Nutritionally, both the leaves and grain of amaranth are of unusual
  value. Tasting like spinach with a touch of horseradish, the raw
  greens have substantially more calcium than beet greens, kale, chard,
  and spinach, and more iron than all these leaf vegetables and
  collards as well. Because the gigantic amaranth yields four times
  more green matter than comparably light-and-carbon-dioxide-efficient
  plants, researchers have declared it an outstanding source of leaf
  protein concentrates that can be used as fodder or as human food.
  
  You can eat the stems and leaves of young stem tips together, but
  it's best to cook the more mature stems alone for 8 to 10 minutes
  (they taste a little like artichokes). To retain the most iron and
  vitamin C in the leaves, steam them for 10 minutes. You can then
  serve them with butter or mixed with peanut butter you've blended
  with water.
  
  If you like, add the raw leaves to soup broth or stir-fry them in
  heated oil in which you've browned a garlic clove, then stir-fry in
  some ground pork, add boiling water, and simmer a while. You can also
  chop and stir-fry the larger shoots with bean sprouts and other
  vegetables, adding a little soy sauce and water during the last 3 to
  5 minutes of cooking. Or try incorporating the leaves in vegetable
  curries as people do in India and Ceylon.
  
  For more good eating, combine a pound of cooked, drained fresh
  amaranth with 1 pound of ricotta cheese, 1 beaten egg, and 1/4 cup
  grated Parmesan, and bake at 350'F for 30 minutes.
  
  Or try raw amaranth chopped and mixed with chopped onion, slightly
  beaten eggs, and a little salt, then fried as small pancakes in
  safflower oil.
  
  This green also tastes great when it's cooked and then added to
  seasoned tomato sauce. If you like, you can mix the cooked greens in
  a blender with minced garlic, parsley, basil, oregano, tomato sauce,
  and some tomato paste, then use this mixture as one of the layers in
  a lasagna that also features broad whole wheat noodles and a blend of
  ricotta cheese, salt, pepper, and parsley.

  little turmeric, cayenne pepper and garam masala (i usually mixes the
  spices and dry roated together before adding to veges). in a large
  pan with a lid layer rice/vege/rice (and repeat as needed). Stick a

  many cloves of garlic, and some curry leaves. On top pour in saffron
  dissolved in skim milk. Add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup water. Secure and
  seal the lid (i seal by sticking dough right around the lid). bake in
  oven at medium (350 or so) for about an hour (just when you are ready
  to eat take it out). Its great and FF!! (i like to bake it enough to
  get some burnt rice at the bottom of the pan. you may want to spray
  the pan lightly with PAM to make it easier to get the burnt rice out)

      Title: VEGETABLE CURRY (KREITZMAN)
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 lg Onions, cut into eighths
  2 1/2 c  Stock
      2    Cloves garlic, crushed
  1 1/2 ts Ground cumin
  1 1/2 ts Ground coriander
    1/2 ts Allspice
    1/2 ts Ground turmeric
    1/2 ts Ground ginger
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper (to taste, it
           Varies widely in hotness)
      1 sm Red & 1 small yellow pepper,
           Chopped
      3    Carrots, peeled & coarsely
           Chopped
    3/4 lb Mushrooms, quartered
      1 tb Tomato puree
      2 md Boiling potatoes, peeled &
           Cut into 1.5 inch dice
      1 lg Cauliflower, trimmed &
           Broken into florets
      1    Lemon, juiced
        x  Salt to taste
    1/2 lb Green beans, trimmed & cut
           Into 1.5 inch lengths
 
  1). Separate the onion pieces into segments & spread them in a heavy
  frying pan. Add no liquid or fat. Heat the pan gently, cooking at
  moderate heat without stirring for 7 to 10 minutes, until the onions
  are sizzling, speckled with dark amber and beginning to stick to the
  pan.
  
  2). Stir in 1.5C stock and deglaze the pan (i.e. let it bubble up,
  stirring up the browned bits in the pan with a spoon as it bubbles).
  Stir in the garlic, spices, peppers, carrots & mushrooms. Reduce heat
  & simmer, stirring frequently, until the mixture is very thick (not
  at all soupy) and the vegetables are "frying" in their own juices.
  Don't rush this step; it is essential that the spices should not have
  a raw, harsh taste. Cook very gently for a few more minutes. Stir in
  the tomato paste.
  
  3). Cool slightly, then puree half the mixture in a blender & push it
  through a sieve. Combine the pureed and unpureed mixture in the pan.
  (I omitted step  3 - I like the chunks of vegetables:-)
  
  4). Add the potatoes and cauliflower to the pan. Toss everything
  together very well. Pour in additional stock to reach about one third
  of the way up the sides of the pan. Squeeze the lemon juice over the
  contents of the pan. Season with salt, bring to a boil.
  
  5). Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Stir in the beans &
  continue simmering for 5 minutes more or until all the vegetables are
  tender.
  
  Note: this reheats very well. If you plan to cook it ahead, undercook
  the curry slightly so that the vegetables do not become mushy when
  they are reheated.

  exclusively vegetarian) cookery book.

      1 ea Green onion, finely chopped
      1 oz Fresh shiitake mushrooms
           -- finely chopped
      2 ts Ginger, chopped
    1/2 c  Green cabbage, chopped
    1/4 c  Carrot, grated

      1 ts Oriental sesame oil
     16 ea Gyoza skins*
           Vegetable oil or
      4 sm Sprigs cilantro, optional
 
  *Gyoza skins are 3" wide rounds similar to wonton skins, although
  they are slightly thinner.  They're available fresh or frozen in most
  Asian markets. If necessary, use wonton skins.
  
  In skillet, heat vegetable oil over medium heat.  Add red pepper,
  green onion, mushrooms and gingerroot; cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add
  cabbage, carrot, soy sauce and sesame oil; cook, stirring
  occasionally, 3 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly.
  
  Working one at a time to prevent Gyoza skins from drying out, place a
  heaping teaspoon of vegetable mixture in center of each round.
  Moisten edge of round with water and fold in half to enclose filling.
  Pinch edges to seal completely.  Set filled dumplings on a plate and
  cover with plastic wrap.
  
  To make fried dumplings, heat 1" vegetable oil over medium-high heat
  in 2-quart saucepan.  In batches, fry dumplings, turning, until
  browned on both sides - about 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels and
  serve.
  
  To cook dumplings in broth, in 2-quart saucepan heat bouillon mixture
  to simmering.  In batches, cook dumplings in simmering broth 3
  minutes. Remove with slotted spoon, dividing among 4 serving bowls or
  deep plates. When all dumplings are cooked, spoon 2 tb. remaining
  broth over each serving. Garnish with cilantro, if desired, and serve.

  Dressing. Spread on cooled baked roll mix.
  
  Mix together chopped vegetables and press into cream cheese mixture.
  
  Refrigerate.  Cut into small squares.  Will keep several days in
  refrigerator.
  
  Personal Note:  This recipe makes a LOT.  I cut all ingredients in
  half and still have plenty to serve (in addition to other snack
  foods). I also replace half the mayo with non-fat yogert, and replace
  the cheddar cheese with a fourth vegetable to cut the fat content
  (Still tastes delicious).
  
  The total servings will change depending on how large or small you
  cut each piece.  I only listed 24 because Meal Master requires a
  number. Please change once you make the recipe and count the pieces.

  grape juice, onion, green pepper, celery garlic, cook until tender,
  5-7 minutes. Add other ingredients, cook over low heat, stirring
  occasionally to keep from sticking to bottom. Cover and simmer gently
  until corn and okra are done. (or simmer in crockpot 6-7 hours) Note:

  corn off the cob. Four ears will make about two cups. If you use
  dried herbs, rub them with the palms of your hands before adding to

      1 c  Part-skim ricotta cheese
    1/4 c  Part-skim mozzarella cheese
    1/4 c  Freshly grated Parmesan
           -cheese
      8 oz Fresh spinach, washed and

           -drained and rinsed
      2 tb Fresh chopped oregano
      2 tb Fresh chopped basin
      8 oz Raw lasagna noodles

MMMMM---------------------------SAUCE--------------------------------
      3 ts Extra-light olive oil with
           -a dash of sesame oil
      2 c  Chopped onions
      2    Cloves garlic, peeled,
           -chopped
      2 c  Finely diced eggplant
      1 lg Red bell pepper, seeded
           -and finely diced
      2 tb Low-sodium tomato paste
    1/4 ts Red pepper flakes
      1 c  Red wine
      1 cn (16 oz) whole tomatoes
           -with liquid
      1 tb Freshly squeezed lemon juice
    1/2 ts Freshly ground salt
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
           -cheese
 
  Combine in a large mixing bowl the three cheeses, the spinach, half
  the beans, half the oregano, and half the basil. Set aside.
  
  Cook the noodles al dente. Cool them under cold water when they're
  cooked the way you like them.
  
  Preheat the oven to 350F. Pour 1 teaspoon of the oil into a large
  skillet over medium-high heat and fry the onions and the garlic for 5
  minutes, stirring often. Transfer half to the spinach and cheese
  filling and set the other half aside. Wipe the pan clean.
  
  Add 1 teaspoon of the oil to the same pan and over a medium heat,
  cook the eggplant for 8 minutes, stirring often. It's important that
  the bottom of the pan does not scorch. Spoon the cooked eggplant into
  the filling mixture and stir well. Wipe the pan clean.
  
  Add the remaining oil to the same pan and, over medium heat, cook the
  red bell pepper for 3 minutes. Spoon the cooked pepper into the
  filling mixture. Wipe the pan clean.
  
  Add the tomato paste to the same pan and, over medium heat, cook
  until it turns brown--about 5 minutes. It is very important it
  doesn't burn but just browns. Stir in the red pepper flakes and the
  wine, bring to a boil, lower the heat to a simmer and reduce the
  liquid by about one fourth--about 15 minutes. Add the canned tomatoes
  and their liquid, stirring until the tomatoes break into pieces.
  
  Add the remaining beans, oregano, basil, and reserved cooked onions
  and garlic and cook for 5 minutes at a very low simmer. Stir in the
  lemon juice, salt, and black pepper and mix well.
  
  Lay a lasagna noodle flat on a cutting board. Form 1/2 cup of the
  filling into a rough ball, lay on one end of the lasagna and roll it
  up end to end. Repeat with the remaining noodles.
  
  Pour the sauce into a 9" X 13" baking pan. Place the lasagna rolls on
  top, seam side down, and spoon some of the sauce over them. Cover
  with aluminum foil and bake for 40 minutes. Remove the foil, sprinkle
  with Parmesan cheese and bake for 5 minutes. Submitted By RHOMMEL

  beforehand to save time.  Grease your casserole pan lightly with some
  oil to help prevent sticking. Place a layer of noodles down and spoon
  some tomato sauce over it.  Put a layer of tofu/veggies down.
  
  Saute the chard (or spinach) in a pan with just a little bit of oil.
  When completely cooked down and soft, add half to the lasagne,
  spreading evenly over the layer. Add more sauce then noodles, then
  tofu than another layer of chard.  Top with more sauce, more noodles
  and a large amount of sauce (to prevent any burning or drying out of
  the noodles when they're cooked). Preheat oven to about 350 or 375

  In a large pot, saut the onion and garlic in the olive oil (put the
  onion in first, and add the garlic when the onion starts to look a
  little translucent) for about 10 minutes.
  
  Run the garbanzo beans and tomatoes through a blender or food
  processor until they are finely chopped, but not smooth.
  
  Add all the ingredients to the pot, and simmer, uncovered, for 45
  minutes to an hour, stirring occasionally.
  
  This sauce is great over all sorts of pasta.

  Delights Cookbook
  
  20 minutes preparation, 1 hour to simmer. Makes enough for 4-6 people.
  
  My changes were to increase the garlic, substitute a grated carrot
  for the honey, add oregano and mushrooms, and use another can of
  tomatoes rather than fresh tomatoes, and retain the texture of
  chopped vegetables by blending only the tomatoes and garbanzos.

  sauce over the bottom of the pan. Arrange 4 pieces of lasagne (3
  lengthwise, 1 widthwise) over the sauce. Cover with 1 1/2 cups of the
  sauce. Spread half the ricotta mixture on top. Arrange another 4
  pieces of lasagne over ricotta, and top with another cup of the
  sauce. Spread remaining ricotta mixture on top. Arrange final 4
  pieces of lasagne over ricotta mixture and cover with remaining sauce.

 Categories: Vegetarian, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Serving
 
    1/2 c  Long-grain brown rice
           Sea salt to taste
      1 ts Tumeric
      2 oz Fresh green beans
      1 sm Carrot
    1/3 c  Shelled peas
      1 sm Onion
      1 sm Garlic clove

      1 ts Coriander
      1 ts Ground cumin
    1/4 ts Garam masala
    1/4 c  Slivered almonds
 
  Cover the rice with boiling water and leave to soak for several hours.
  Drain, rinse, cover with water, add a little salt and the tumeric,
  bring to the boil, then lower heat, and cook until the water is
  absorbed and rice tender, about 20 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, chop the beans and carrot. Steam them -- and the peas --
  until just tender.  Drain and set aside.
  
  Chop the onion.  Crush the garlic.  Grate the ginger finely. Chop the
  tomato.
  
  Heat the margarine in a pan and add the onion.  Saute until beginning
  to brown.  Add the garlic and ginger and cook for a minute longer.
   Lower heat and stir in the spices.  Then add the tomato and cook for
  a minute longer.  Remove from heat and stir in the cooked vegetables.
  
  Place half the cooked rice on the bottom of a greased ovenproof dish,
  spoon the vegetable mixture over it, then top with the other half of
  the rice. Cover the dish (if it has no lid then use foil) and bake it
  at 350 degrees F (180 C) Gas Mark 4 for about half an hour.
  
  Toast the almonds under a hot grill (broiler) until lightly browned.
  When the pilau is ready and dished up, sprinkle the almonds on top.

      Title: VEGETABLE PLATTER
 Categories: Vietnamese, Appetizers, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lg Head of Boston or other
           -soft lettuce, separated
           -into individual leaves
      1 bn Of scallions, cut into
           -2-inch lengths
      1 c  Coriander leaves
      1 c  Mint leaves
      1 c  Fresh Asian or regular
           -basil leaves
      1    Cucumber, peeled in
           -alternating strips, halved
           -lengthwise and slice
           -thinly crosswise
      4 oz Fresh bean sprouts
           Pickled shallots (optional)
 
  On a large platter, decoratively arrange all of the ingredients in
  separate groups.  Use in recipes where required.
  
  This is a basic thing in Vietnamese cuisine, served with all sorts of
  grilled foods.  Such uses of raw veggies herbs are one of the things
  about Vietnamese cuisine that makes it so fresh and appealing.
  
  Vietnamese meals include an abundance of fresh lettuce, herbs, unripe
  fruits and raw vegetables. These are arranged attractively on a
  platter and are used for wrapping cooked foods at the table, usually
  dipped in Nuoc Cham and eaten out of hand.
  
  The following herbs, both very important to the Vietnamese, would be
  authentic additions to the Vegetable Platter: One is the "saw leaf
  herb" (Eryngium foetidium), or ngo gai in Vietnamese), a coriander
  relative. The other is polygonum (P. pulchrum or rau ram in
  Vietnamese), with pinkish stems, pointed green leaves and purplish
  markings. They can be found occasionally at Southeast Asian markets.
  If you have access to unripe mango, banana, papaya or apple and star
  fruit (carambola), add them to the platter.  You may select or
  substitute the ingredients according to availability and personal
  taste.
  
  Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

      Title: VEGETABLE PULLAO
 Categories: Vegetarian, Indian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 c  Whole mung bean
           -- picked over and washed
      2 c  Long-grain rice
  4 1/2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 ts Whole black mustard seeds
      1 md Onion
           -- peeled and finely chopped
      4 md Garlic cloves
           -- peeled and finely minced
      1 ts Peeled, minced ginger
    1/3 lb String beans; trimmed
           -- and cut into 1/4" pieces
      2 ts Garam masala
  1 1/2 ts Ground coriander
  2 1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Finely minced parsley
           -- preferably Chinese
 
  Put mung beans in a bowl with 3 cups water.  Cover lightly and set
  aside for 12 hours.  Drain beans and wrap in a very damp dish towel.
  Put the wrapped bundle in a bowl. Put this bowl in a dark place (like
  an unused oven) for 24 hours.
  
  Wash rice well and soak in 4 cups of water for half an hour. Drain
  well.
  
  Preheat oven to 325 F.
  
  Heat oil in a wide, heavy, 4- to 5-quart ovenproof pot over a
  medium-high flame.  When hot, put in mustard seeds. As soon as the
  mustard seeds begin to pop (this takes just a few seconds), put in
  the onion. Stir and fry for about 5 minutes or until onion turns
  brown at the edges. Add the garlic and ginger.  Fry, stirring, for
  about 1 minute. Turn heat to medium-low and add the mung beans, rice,
  string beans, mushrooms, garam masala, ground coriander, and salt.
  Stir and saute for about 10 minutes or until rice turns translucent
  and vegetables are well coated with oil. Add 4 cups hot water and the
  minced parsley.  Turn heat to a medium-high flame and cook, stirring,
  for about 5 minutes or until most of the water is absorbed. (There
  will be an inch or so of water at the bottom.) Cover the pot first
  with aluminum foil, crimping and sealing the edges, and then with its
  own lid.  Place in heated oven for half an hour.  Fluff up with a
  fork and serve.

      Title: VEGETABLE SOUP
 Categories: Soups, Italian, Vegetables
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      8 c  Chicken broth (see recipe)
    1/3 c  Olive oil
    1/4 c  Chopped parsley
      4 ea Garlic cloves
    1/4 lb Pancetta or unsmoked bacon
      3 c  Shredded cabbage
      1 ea Medium onion, finely chopped
      2 ea Carrots, finely chopped
      1 ea Celery stalk, finely chopped
      1 ea Potato, peeled, chopped
      2 ea Zucchini, finely chopped
      1 ea Large tomato, chopped
    1/4 lb Mushrooms, finely chopped
    1/4 lb String beans finely chopped
      4 ea Pieces prosciutto rind
      1 x  Salt, to taste
      1 x  Pepper, to taste
    1/2 c  Grated Parmesan cheese
 
  There are as many versions of vegetable soup in Italy as there there
  are cooks. Pancetta - Pancetta is the same cut of pork as bacon. It
  is cured with salt and is not smoked.  It comes rolled up like a
  large salami. Widely used in Italian cooking, especially in
  Emilia-Romagna, it is vital to many dishes. If available, buy a large
  quantity. Cut into several pieces and freeze it.  You can substitute
  domestic bacon for pancetta. It must be blanched in boiling water for
  two three minutes to reduce the smoky flavour.  Fresh side pork can
  also be used. I'll be posting several recipes over the next while
  that call for pancetta, so if you can find some, it won't go to
  waste. Prepare chicken broth (see my previously posted recipe). Heat
  oil in a large saucepan. Add parsley and garlic. Saute over medium
  heat.  Before garlic changes colour, add pancetta. Saute until
  lightly browned.  Stir in cabbage.  Cover and cook 1 to 2 minutes.
  Add remaining vegetables to saucepan. Cover and cook about 5 minutes.
  Add broth and water, if using, and prosciutto rind or ham shank.
  Cover and reduce heat. Simmer 40 to 50 minutes. Remove half the
  vegetables with a slotted spoon. Place in a blender or food processor
  and process until smooth. Return to saucepan. Season with salt and
  pepper. Serve hot with Parmesan cheese sprinkled over top. Makes 8 to
  10 servings. VARIATION: Toast about 20 thick slices of Italian bread.
  Place 2 slices in each soup bowl and sprinkle generously with
  Parmesan cheese. Ladle soup into bowls. Serve with additional
  Parmesan cheese.

  Vegetable Stock: ================
  
       At least 8 - 10 hours before serving, place all of the
  ingredients in a stockpot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil,
  skim, and simmer for 20 minutes.
  
       Strain the liquid, return to heat, and reduce it by one-fourth.
  Skim carefully during the reducing process. Remove from heat and
  measure the remaining liquid. For each 2 cups of hot stock, add 1
  tablespoon gelatin dissolved in 2 tablespoons of cold water. Add salt
  and white pepper to taste.
  
       Pour into a flat pan and chill for 2 - 3 hours.
  
  For the Garnish: ================
  
       Use any combination of 4 or 5 cold fresh seasonal vegetables, cut
  thinly and shredded.
  
      Remove the jelly from the refrigerator half an hour before
  serving. Let it stand at room temperature to warm slightly (if it is
  served too cold, the flavor will be lost).
  
       To serve, scatter small amounts of vegetable garnish in soup
  bowls. Break jelly into irregular pieces with a fork and place on top
  of garnish. For each person, use 1/2 cup. Top with fresh herbs, such
  as chives, basil, or tarragon.
  
       If available, add edible flowers such as borage, onion, or
  nasturtium petals.  Serve within 5 minutes, since jelly begins to
  lose form if held longer.
  
       Preparation time:  2 hours (elapsed time)

      Title: VEGETABLE SOUP (MCDERMOTT)
 Categories: None
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    2 zucchini, quartered and
           Cut into 1 inch segments
     10 md Mushrooms (aged ones work
           Well), halved or quartered
      2    Russet potatoes cut into 1
           1/2 -2 inch pieces
      2 c  Greenbeans, cut into 1-inch
           Segments
      1    Tomato and 1/2 cup canned
           Tomatoes or 1-1 1/2 cup
           Canned tomatoes
      1    Onion, cut into chunks
      1    Carrot (or two), thinly
           Sliced
      2    Stalks celery, cut into
      1    Inch pieces
      1 bn Spinach, remove stems and
           Wash
      1    2 cups cauliflower, cut into
           Florettes
      6    Cloves garlic (diced or
           Whole)
      3    Bay leaves
      2 ts Or so herbs: sage, marjoram,
           Basil, thyme, oregano
  1 1/2 ts Garlic powder
    1/4 c  Tamari/soy sauce
      5    7 cups water
 
  In a large pot place onion, carrot, celery, spices, garlic, soy sauce,
  garlic powder, bay leaves and water. Bring to a boil and cook 15
  minutes. Add tomato, mushrooms and green beans and cook for 15 more
  minutes. Add potatoes and more water if needed. In 15 more minutes
  add the cauliflower and zucchini. Adjust seasonings and add salt to
  taste (or more soy sauce). When everything is cooked, remove from
  heat. Add spinach, making sure to submurse it in order to wilt the
  leaves. Serve.
  
  Amounts of vegetables are aproximate, as are cooking times. The soup
  needs to cook around 1 hour or 1 hour 15 minutes, so gauge when to
  add vegetables by how little you want them to be cooked (or
  overcooked). This is a hearty but light soup, so chunk vegetables in
  large pieces.

      1 lg Tomato
      1 sm Fennel bulb
      1 lb Fresh spinach
      1 lb Fresh Swiss chard (OR

      2 lg Russet potatoes (14 Oz)
      2 lg Carrots
      6 oz Parmesan cheese
      2    Fresh or (smoked) ham hocks
           -(1 Lb)
      2 tb Olive oil
      4 qt Basic Broth (or water)
      1    Bay leaf
      1 pk Frozen corn (10 oz) (OR 4

           -oz fresh)
           Salt
           Freshly-ground black pepper
 
  PREPARATION:  Rinse, pick over beans, and put them in a bowl of cold
  water to cover by 3 inches.  Let stand for 24 hours; drain. (OR, put
  beans in a large saucepan with water to cover, bring to a boil,
  cover, remove from heat, and let stand for 1 hour; drain.) Peel and
  mince the garlic. Peel and coarsely chop the tomato. Cut the fennel
  into 1/4-inch dice. Rinse spinach and Swiss chard and cut into
  1/2-inch julienne strips. Peel potatoes and carrots; leave whole.
  Grate the cheese (1 1/2 cups).
  
  COOKING:  Put drained beans in a large saucepan; add ham hocks and 2
  quarts water.  Bring to a boil, partially cover, and simmer for 20
  minutes; drain.
  
  Bring 2 quarts of water to boil in a 6-quart soup kettle, add fennel,
  spinach and Swiss chard, and simmer until vegetables are tender,
  about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.
  
  Heat oil in soup kettle.  Add garlic and saute until golden, about 1
  minute.  Add the tomato and cook over low heat until tomato liquid
  evaporates, about 10 minutes. Add the beans, hocks, broth , and bay
  leaf. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer for 30 minutes.  Add whole
  potatoes and carrots, cover and simmer until they are tender, about
  30 minutes longer. Transfer potatoes and carrots to a large plate and
  mash with a potato masher.  Return mashed mixture to the kettle, and
  stir in the spinach mixture, corn, and peas. Bring soup to a boil,
  then simmer, stirring and skimming foam from surface occasionally,
  until peas and corn are tender, about 15 minutes.  Season with salt,
  if necessary.
  
  SERVING:  Ladle soup into warm bowls.  Sprinkle with ground pepper and
  cheese.
  
  Makes 10 to 12 main course servings.

      Title: VEGETABLE SOUP WITH GOULASH TASTE
 Categories: Soups, Vegetables, Low-cal
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
      6 dl Water
    150 g  Yellow onion; chopped
    150 g  Turnip; cut in small cubes
    200 g  Squash; cut in small cubes
    200 g  Carrot; shredded
     50 g  Tomato; cut in small pieces
      4 dl Tomato juice
      2 dl Water
      2    Meat extract cubes; should
           -be enough to make 1/2 litre
           -meat broth, but do NOT use
           -meat broth!
           Salt
           White pepper
           Basil; *
 
  * Use wathever you like from spices and herbs. I usually add some
  "taco table spicemix", some oregano and some black pepper.
  
  Bring the water to a boil together with the meat extract cubes. Add
  vegetables and tomato juice. Add more water, put the water into the
  tomato juice packet and shake so you get all of the juice out of it.
  Let simmer until everything get really mixed and you can't really see
  what is what. Mix a little water with flour, add, stir well and let
  boil for a couple of minutes.
  
  These are pretty large servings, and noone has to be hungry after
  eating... You can replace almost all the vegetables with something
  else, it should be a total of about 800 g vegetables, that's the main
  "rule" in this recipe...

  ~- Combine all ingredients except rice papers and oil. Cut the rice
  papers into quarters.  Wet the surface of each paper with water (use
  your fingers or a brush) and within about 1 min the paper will become
  flexible enough to be filled.  Place about 1 tbsp of the filling on
  each paper and roll. Heat the oil in a wok to about 350 deg. F. Place
  rolls, flaps-down, into oil and cook 20 min (10 min each side), until
  completely done.
   Serve with Buddhist Nuoc Leo. ~- Disclaimer: This recipe is fat-city.
  There is another form of spring roll skin which is inherently sticky
  and stretchy (white and barely opaque), and doesn't require deep
  frying. (One could lighly saute the carrots and potatoes beforehand.)
  I can't remember what this wrapper is called.  BTW - With this
  alternate type of "spring roll" fresh chinese parsley or cilantro is
  often included. ~- Side note: About forming a spring roll from
  quartered rice paper...

      Title: VEGETABLE STOCK (REFERENCE)
 Categories: Digest, Dec., Text, Reference
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           None
      4    Vegetable Stocks Described:
 
  Pritikin Vegetable Broth is canned and ff.  It has 290 mg sodium per
  serving (about 1 cup).  Though that isn't great, the label says it is
  65% less sodium than Swanson canned veggie broth. I haven't tried it
  yet.
  
  Hain makes a canned vegetable stock that is good, but it isn't clear
  so it isn't too good for clear soups or gravies. It's basically
  pureed veggies. It has the texture of v8 juice and the color of
  carrot juice.
  
  Vecon is a stock base that comes in a jar.  It's imported from
  England. It's pretty good.  (Thanks to Michael Traub for pointing me
  to it.) 1/2 tsp makes 1 cup of broth and has 40mg of fat (i.e. .040
  gram, ff by American labeling standards).  It has 235 mg sodium. The
  first ingredient is hydrolyzed vegetable protein, which I think some
  people avoid -- I think it's a source of msg.
  
  Gayelord Hauser's Instant Vegetable Broth is a powder. It contains
  yeast, soy flour, hydrolized vegetable protein, and a bunch of ground
  up dehydrated vegetables. Vegetables that are dehydrated, ground, then
  reconstituted in boiling water taste a lot different from vegetable
  stock that is dehydrated.  I think this stuff is rather bland, but it
  might be ok for cooking. It doesn't give nutritional info on the box,
  but based on the ingredients (no added salt or fat) it should be
  pretty good.
  
  There's a brand of stock called "Take Stock" that comes frozen in 8-oz
  containers.  They have a veggie stock that I think is ff that I only
  have tried once. The stuff I made from it was awful, through no fault
  of the stock, but that means I don't know if the stock is good on its
  own. Don't know about sodium.

  1 1/2 c  Sushi rice vinegar
           (or regular rice vinegar
           -w/ts sugar added)
      3    To 4 eggs beaten
      1 pk Fresh spinach, washed
           Small container pickled red
           -ginger slivers
      1 pk (about 6 large) dried
           -Shiitake mushrooms
      1 oz Pkg. Kampyo (dried gourd
           -strips)
    1/4 c  Soy sauce
 
  Jerry's Long-Awaited Worth-Waiting-For Vegetable Sushi Roll
  (MAKISUSHI) w/Egg
  
  Nori (seaweed sheets) - 10 sheets Bamboo sushi mat ** Kampyo/Shiitake
  ~ ** Wash Kampyo; soak in enough water to cover 40 minutes, or until
  soft. Drain.  Combine Shiitake and 2-1/2 cups water in medium-size
  saucepan. Let stand 20 minutes.  Add softened Kampyo to Shiitake and
  liquid in saucepan. Bring to boil; simmer, cover 5 minutes. Stir in
  1/4 cup soy sauce; simmer 15 minutes longer, or until Kampyo is
  lightly colored. Stir occasionally. Drain and cool; squeeze out
  liquid from Shiitake (using paper towels). Divide Kampyo into 10
  portions, each portion being about 8-9 inches long (the length of a
  Nori sheet).  Remove and discard Shiitake stems; cut Shiitake into
  1/4-inch thick slices.
  
  Rice -  Wash rice until water runs clear; drain well. Combine rice
  and 5 cups water in large sauce pan. Bring to boil; reduce heat and
  simmer on lowest possible heat, cover 20-25 minutes, or until water
  is absorbed. Don't Stir!!! (stick a fork into rice to bottom of pan
  and if no water remains, it's ready). Remove from heat and let stand
  covered for at least 10 minutes. Rice should be on the firm side, not
  mushy. Remove 1/2 rice to large non-metal mixing bowl and let cool
  some. Pour 1/2 cup sushi rice vinegar evenly over top of rice and
  toss gently to combine. Add remaining rice (cooled some) and another
  1/2 cup vinegar. Toss gently to mix. Cool.
  
  Egg -  Pour 1/2 egg mixture evenly into lightly oiled hot skillet and
  cook over medium-high heat until set. Turn out; cool and slice into
  10 strips. Repeat with remaining egg mixture.
  
  Spinach -  Bring washed spinach to boil in a little water, then lower
  heat and cook for several minutes. Drain well and let cool (it is
  important that as much water as possible is drained from the spinach
  ~ one way is to allow spinach to cool in a mesh strainer). Divide
  into 10 portions of strips (you may not need all the spinach you have
  cooked). ** Putting It All Together ** Unroll the bamboo sushi mat
  away from you. Place 1 sheet Nori on mat, lining it up with the
  bottom of mat. Moisten hands with a little of the remaining sushi
  rice vinegar to prevent rice from sticking. Place enough rice on Nori
  to cover 3/4 of the sheet and a little more than 1/2 inch thick.
  Press down with fingers (not too firmly). Over center of the rice,
  from left to right, place 1 spinach strip along with a Kampyo
  portion, 2 egg strips, and several Shiitake strips. Each strip should
  extend the length of the rice. Finally, add a modest amount of
  drained pickled red ginger slivers along the top of the other strips.
  
  Hold line of ingredients across rice firmly in place with finger tips.
  Using thumbs, push up and turn bamboo sushi mat edge nearest you up
  and over filling, pressing firmly to enclose filling, and lifting the
  bamboo mat while rolling to keep it free from being enclosed in the
  sushi roll. The idea is to get everything rolled before reaching the
  far edge of the Nori sheet.  When sushi is rolled, gently but firmly,
  press bamboo mat around roll again, but this time to shape. (The art
  of making sushi is to get filling ingredients lined up in the center
  of the roll). Unroll mat and wrap sushi in plastic or aluminum wrap;
  repeat with remaining ingredients to make 10 rolls.
  
  To serve, place rolls, seam-side down, on cutting surface and cut
  crosswise into about 8 equal slices. (Refrigeration will cause sushi
  to dry out, so eat). Enjoy!!!!! Jerry Masefield

      Title: VEGETABLE TERRINE
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------VEGETABLE LAYERS---------------------------
  1 3/4 oz Dry shitake mushrooms
      7 lg Cabbage leaves (preferably
           -savoy)
     12 oz Fresh spinach, stemmed
     12 oz Fresh asparagas, trimmed

MMMMM---------------------------BATTER--------------------------------
    1/2 c  Buttermilk
      1 tb Chopped fresh parsley
      1 ts Dried thyme
      1 ts Dried tarragon
      2    Shallots, chopped
           -salt and pepper to taste

MMMMM------------------------TOMATO SAUCE-----------------------------
      1 lg Tomato, peeled and seeded
           -and chopped (1 cup)
    1/4 c  Buttermilk
      1 tb Tomato paste
        pn Cayenne pepper
      1    Garlic clove, chopped
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  TO PREPARE VEGETABLE LAYERS: 1) In small bowl, combine dry mushrooms
  and hot water to cover. Let stand 30 minutes. Drain. 2) While
  mushrooms are rehydrating, bring large pot of water to boiling.
  Blanch vegetables in separate batches in boiling water. Blanch
  cabbage leaves 3 minutes, spinach leaves 1 minute, asparagus and red
  pepper strips 3 minutes, and carrots 4 minutes. Plunge vegetables
  into ice water after blanching. Drain. 3) Pat all blanched
  vegetables, mushrooms, and artichokes dry between 2 to 3 layers of
  paper towels, applying gentle pressure to squeeze out as much liquid
  as possible. (spinach leaves should be opened out flat to assume
  original shape) TO MAKE BATTER: 1) In medium bowl combine eggs, 1/2
  cup buttermilk, parsley, thyme, tarragon, shallots, and salt and
  pepper to taste. Whisk until blended. (This batter is overseasoned
  because it will flavor all the vegetables) TO ASSEMBLE TERRINE: 1)
  Generously butter 9x5x3 inch loaf pan. Using a triangular-shaped cut,
  remove 1 to 2 inches of hard white stem from cabbage leaves to make
  leaves more flexible. 2) Line sides, then bottom of pan with cabbage
  leaf to make leaves, overlapping the leaves generously to form a
  "leakproof shell" and allowing leaves to extend well over the rim of
  the pan. (The tops of leaves will be folded over the top of the
  finished terrine.) Pour 1/2 cup batter over cabbage in bottom of pan.
  3) Arrange asparagus spears lengthwise in pan, packing spears tightly
  together. Add 2 layers of red pepper strips placed crosswise in pan.
  Pour in a little more batter, pressing peppers down gently. 4) Layer
  mushrooms over peppers. Layer carrots lengthwise in pan. Pour in a
  little more batter, pressing carrots down gently. (Pressing each
  layer down will raise the level of the batter) 5) Layer half the
  spinach leaves over carrots. Add a layer of artichoke hearts over
  spinach, then add a little more batter. Gently press down artichoke
  hearts. 6) Top with a layer of remaining spinach leaves, add
  remaining batter and pressing down each layer. Fold ends of cabbage
  leaves over top of terrine. 7) Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Cover
  loaf pan with buttered parchment paper cut to fit inside edge of pan.
  Place loaf pan in 13x9x2 inch baking pan. Pour hot water around loaf
  pan to depth of 1 inch. 8) Bake at 350 degrees F. for two hours until
  firm. Remove from water bath. Cool on rack (still covered with
  parchment paper) 2 hours. 9) Refrigerate, still covered, overnight.
  TO MAKE TOMATO SAUCE: 1) In blender, combine chopped tomato, 1/4 cup
  buttermilk, tomato paste, cayenne pepper, garlic, and salt and pepper
  to taste. Blend until smooth. TO SERVE: 1) Loosen edges of terrine
  with knife. Invert on serving platter. Cut cold terrine in crosswise
  slices with serrated knife. 2) Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce on
  each serving plate. Arrange slices of terrine over sauce.

 Categories: Beans, Soups, Potatoes, Mcdougall
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      1 c  Kidney beans; dried
      2    Garlic cloves; pressed
      1    Onion; chopped
      2    Potato; cut in chunks
      1    Carrot; sliced 1/2" thick
      2    Zucchini; sliced 1" thick
    1/4 lb Green beans
      2    Leek
    1/4 lb Cabbage
           (savoy is best)
    1/3 c  Brown rice, long-grain; * se
      3    Tomato; cut in wedges
    1/4 c  Parsley sprigs; chopped
    1/4 ts Celery seed
    1/4 ts Marjoram
      1 ts Basil
      1 ts Oregano
 
  Recipe by: McDougall Place beans in pot with 2 quarts of water. Bring
  to boil, remove from heat and let rest 1 hour. Then add chopped
  onion, garlic, and simmer for
    1 1/2    hours.
  
  Chop potatoes in large chunks; do not peel. Slice carrots 1/2 inch and
  zucchini 1 inch thick, scrub them, do not peel. Slice leeks and cut
  beans into 1 inch pieces. Add to soup pot along with seasonings.
  Simmer for 1 hour longer.
  
  Thinly slice cabbage and add to soup along with rice or spaghetti.
  Simmer another 20 minutes. Add more water if too thick. Add tomato
  wedges for the last 10 minutes, just before serving.
  
  HELPFUL HINTS: Kidney beans make a good rich broth, but any kind of
  bean also may be used. Soup freezes well, so make a large batch when
  you have time and freeze half for use on a budy day. Try using some
  chopped spinach, instead of the cabbage. By changing the vegetables
  and beans used, the soup can be different each time you make it. It
  is a meal in itself. From the collection of Sue Smith, S.Smith34,

      Title: VEGETABLE-OIL SOAP
 Categories: Info
      Yield: 5 & 1/2 lbs
 
      1 qt Cold water
 10 1/4 oz Pure lye crystals
     23 oz White vegetable shortening
     42 oz Olive oil
     16 oz Coconut oil
 
  If you have trouble getting animal fat, or don't want to render it
  down, this soap is for you. This formula makes a mild soap rich with
  coconut oil and olive oil.
  
  SUPPLIES 2 quart lye-proof cooking pot plus 8-quart lye-proof cooking
  pot (stainless steel, stoneware, or enameled cast iron)
  
  rubber work gloves goggles, safety glasses, or face shield face mask
  1 cup white vinegar (used as safety precaution only) stainless steel
  or wooden spoon dairy, meat, or candy thermometer hand eggbeater
  flexible plastic soap molds, such as margarine tubs or cardboard or
  wooden boxes lined with plastic wrap
  
  * BE SAFE.  Lye is very caustic; it can destroy skin by chemical
  action. Handle it very carefully.
  
  Place water in the 2-quart lye-proof pot. Put on rubber gloves and
  other safety gear. Have the vinegar handy. Very slowly add lye
  crystals to water, constantly stirring until lye is dissolved. As lye
  is added to water, the water temperature will rise to around 150 deg
  F. Place the thermometer in the water and allow it to cool to 95 to
  98 degrees.
  
  As the water is cooling, slowly heat the vegetable shortening and
  oils in the 8-quart lye-proof pot until it reaches 95 to 98 F. When
  both lye and fats are in the same 95 to 98 F temperature range,
  slowly pour lye into fat, stirring constantly until well-mixed. Beat
  mixture very gently with the eggbeater to the consistency of thick
  honey. Avoid splashing.
  
  Pour the mixture into molds, cover with a blanket, and set aside to
  dry for 24 hours, well away from children or pets. After 24 hours,
  carefully turn the soap out of the molds and leave it in a dry, airy
  place for at least two weeks. A fine white powder may appear on the
  surface when the soap is a few days old. This is sodium carbonate.
  Wash it away when the soap is mature; it tends to make the skin dry.
  
  * Notes:  Lye is crystalline sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide.
  It is usually sold in the drain cleaner section of supermakets and
  hardware stores. Buy pure lye crystals or flakes, not lye sold as a
  liquid drain cleaner.  Buy coconut oil from drug stores and health
  food stores.

 Categories: Chinese
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
 
       12    asparagus spears -- * see
  :          note
        2    carrots
        2    green onions
        1 TB sweet and sour sauce
        1 TB pineapple juice -- or orange
  :          juice
      1/2 ts ginger root -- grated
        4    eggs
        2 TB water
        2 ts cooking oil
        2 TB nuts -- ** see note
  :          radish -- shredded
  :          cucumber -- thinly sliced
  
  * Prepare vegetables by cutting the asparagus into 3-inch lengths, the
  carrots into 3-inch sticks and green onions into 2-inch lengths. Shred
  radishes  and slice cucumbers thin (optional ingredients) **Use
  toasted walnuts or almonds, chopped In a large saucepan, cook
  asparagus, carrots and green onions in a small amount of boiling,
  lightly salted water for 7-9 minutes until crisp-tender; drain well.
  Meanwhile for the sauce, stir together sweet-sour sauce, pineappple
  or orange juice and grated ginger root (or 1/8 teaspoon ground
  ginger) Set aside. For omelets, combine eggs and water in a small
  bowl. Use fork to beat until combined but not frothy. In an 8-10 inch
  skillet with flared sides, heat 1 teaspoon of the oil until a drop of
  water sizzles.  Lift and tilt pan to coat all sides of skillet. Add
  1/2 cup of egg mixture and cook over medium heat. As eggs set, run a
  spatula around the edge of the skillet; lift eggs and let uncooked
  portion flow underneath. When eggs are set but still shiny, transfer
  to a warm plate, cover with plastic wrap. Repeat with remaining egg
  mixture and oil as needed to make 2 omelets. To assemble, spread some
  of the sauce onto each omelet. Arrange steamed vegetables on one
  quarter of each omelet, fanning vegetables to edge of omelets. Fold
  each omelet over vegetables; fold again.  Top with additional sauce
  and sprinkle with nuts. Jo Anne Merrill  recipe from my files.

      Title: VEGETABLE-STUFFED TROUT
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      2    Trout, about
           -1/2 pound each
      1 tb Margarine
      2 tb Lemon juice
      1    Green pepper
    1/2    Onion
           Assorted seasonings
           -(salt, pepper,
           -bay leaf, basil,
           -dried parsley, etc.)
 
  Clean and scale the trout.  Wash carefully.  You can leave the heads
  on if you like.
  
  Cut up the green pepper and onion into bite-size chunks. If you're
  feeling experimental, try adding a bit of tomato (or whatever).
  
  Melt the margarine in a microwaveable dish big enough to accommodate
  the fish. Stir in the lemon juice. Roll the fish around in the
  lemon-butter mixture and sprinkle with seasonings to taste. Add the
  vegetables to the dish (don't put them in the trout yet).
  
  Cover loosely to prevent spatters (a paper plate or wax paper works
  fine) and microwave on high power for about 7 minutes, or until the
  fish is opaque and flaky and the vegetables are tender. Flip the fish
  over and stir the vegetables once or twice during this time. Scoop
  some of the vegetables and sauce into the body cavity before serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Stuffed trout cooked in a microwave oven -- I prefer fish cooked
  in the microwave to ordinary baked fish, because it doesn't get dried
  out. The texture is similar to what you get when you cook fish
  wrapped in aluminum foil outdoors over a wood fire. It's also much
  less work!
  
  *  This recipe is for a standard 600 to 700 watt microwave oven.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy if you know how to clean a trout.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 10 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  No need to measure.

 Categories: Info, Kooknet
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------SUMMER SQUASH----------------------------

MMMMM------------------HARVEST, STORE, SERVING-----------------------
 
  WHEN AND HOW TO HARVEST Time from planting to harvest depends on the
  variety, as does the yield you can expect. Harvest summer squashes
  when they're young--they taste delicious when they're small, and if
  you leave them on the plant too long they will suppress flowering and
  reduce your crop.  Harvest summer squashes like the zucchini and
  crookneck varieties when they're six to eight inches long; harvest
  the round types when they're four to eight inches in diameter. Break
  the squashes from the plant, or use a knife that you clean after
  cutting each one; if the knife is not perfectly clean, it can spread
  disease to other plants.
  
  STORING AND PRESERVING Summer squashes can be stored in the
  refrigerator for up to one week; don't wash them until you're ready
  to use them. They can also be frozen, canned, pickled, or dried.
  
  SERVINGS SUGGESTIONS Summer squashes lend themselves to a good
  variety of culinary treatments. Saute slices of summer squash with
  onions and tomatoes for a robust but delicately flavored side dish.
  Add sliced zucchini and mushrooms to a thick tomato sauce for
  spaghetti. Halve summer squashes and stuff with a meat or rice
  mixture, or bake them with butter and parmesan cheese. Pan-fry slices
  of summer squash, or simmer them with fruit juice for a new flavor.
  Use the popular zucchini raw on a relish tray and among vegetables
  for a tempura, or slice it thinly in salads. Use the larger fruit for
  making zucchini bread.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM------------------SUMMER SQUASH VARIETIES-----------------------
 
  SQUASH, SUMMER:
    Botanical name: Cucurbita species
      Origin: American tropics
  
  COMMON NAMES: Summer Squash, Crookneck, Pattypan, Straightneck,
  Scallop, Zucchini
  
  VARIETIES:
    Crookneck: Golden Summer Crookneck (53 days)
  
    Scallop or Pattypan: Peter Pan (60 days)
                         Scallopini hybrids (60 days)
                         St. Patrick Green Tint (60 days)
  
    Straightneck: Early Prolific Straightneck (50 days)
  
    Zucchini: Gold Rush (60 days)
  :          Zucchini hybrids (60 days)
  
  These are only a few of the varieties available.  Ask your Cooperative
  Extension Service for other specific recommendations for your area.
  
  DESCRIPTION: The cucumber family, to which squashes belong, probably
  has the greatest diversity of shapes and sizes of any vegetable
  family except the cabbages.
   It's the genus Cucurbita and includes certain gourds and pumpkins,
  as well as squashes. Most are trailing or climbing plants with large
  yellow flowers (both male and female); the mature fruits have a thick
  skin and a definite seed cavity.  "Summer squash," "Winter squash,"
  and "Pumpkin" are not definite botanical names. "Pumpkin," which any
  child can tell you is a large vegetable used for jack-o-lanterns and
  pies, is applied to longkeeping varieties of C. Moschata, C. pepo,
  and a few varieties of C. maxima.  Summer squashes are eaten when
  they are immature; winter squashes are eaten when mature.
  
  Squashes are hard to confine.  A bush-type zucchini will grow well in
  a tire planter if kept well watered and fertilized; a vining squash
  can be trained up a fence. Summer squashes are week-stemmed, tender
  annuals, with large, cucumberlike leaves and seperate male and female
  flowers that appear on the same plant. Summer squash usually grows as
  a bush, rather than as a vine; the fruits have thin, tender skin and
  are generally eaten in the immature stage before the skin hardens.
  The most popular of the many kinds of summer squashes are crookneck,
  straightneck, scallop, and zucchini.

  flesh. Mild, slightly sweet, corn-like flavour. Microcook rings or
  chunks in 1/4 cup water, in a covered dish about 5-7 min.; let stand
  5 min. Or place halves cut side up in covered dish with 1/4 cup
  water, cook 7-10 min. rotating once. Let stand 5 min.

  flattened ball shapes. Golden flesh, rich squash flavour. Cook as for
  Buttercup squash. Takes well to stuffings, glazes and mashed or pureed
  mixtures.
  
  MEDITERRANEAN: It looks like a jumbo Butternut, but internal texture

  Delicata squash.  Bake and stuff with vegetables or cheese. Pulp is
  sweet enough for pies.
  
  SPAGHETTI: Between a winter and summer squash, with a semi-soft bright
  yellow shell and stringy yellow interior that separates into
  spaghetti like strands when cooked. Sweet, mild, crunchy flavour.

  SWEET DUMPLING: A small pumpkin-shaped squash, with a streaked white
  and green- colored hard shell. Orange-yellow flesh. Naturally
  sweet-tasting flesh. Cook as for Buttercup squash. Excellent for just
  one or two servings. The shell is hollow enough to hold stuffing for

  nuts and run under the broiler.
  
  TABLE QUEEN, GREEN AND GOLD (ACORN, DESMOINES, DANISH): Acorn-shaped
  with green to yellow-gold skin, with deep furrows. Yellowish flesh.

  Notes/Hints: For fat free, spray vegetables with Pam and omit oil,
  thus "wilting" them instead of cooking in oil. Wilt means using
  little heat and covering the pan. Also, because of use of canned
  vegetables, this recipe may not be suitable for those on a low-sodium
  diet. Suggested toppings for chili:  non-fat sour cream, non-fat
  cheddar cheese substitute, and chopped scallions.

      3 cn Pinto beans
      1 lg Can crushed tomatoes
      1 lg Onion, chopped
    1/2 c  Vegetable stock
      1 tb Garlic
      1 tb Cumin
      2    Packets achiote (annato mix
           In ethnic section of
           Grocery)
      1 tb Parsley
      2 tb Paprika
      2 tb Hot sauce
 
  Saute onions, cumin, parsley, garlic and paprika in vegetable stock in
  large stock pot. Add pinto beans, tomato, and achiote and simmer for
  about 1 hour. Add about 4 cups of cooked brown rice and let stand for
  about 1 hour.
  
  I usually make this in a crock pot.  Just add sauted onions and
  spices to the rest of the ingredients in a crock pot and let it cook
  overnight.
  
  I add the cooked rice the next morning and leave the pot on all day.
  
  The chili usually comes out quite runny until you add the cooked rice
  and let it sit. The rice absorbes most of the moisture leaving a
  thick hearty chili.
  
  I use the Lundberg Farms rice blends especially the japonica blend
  and the christmas blend.

  A BAG OF BEAN TRICKS:
  
  A bag of bean tricks to help you buy, soak, cook & store dry beans.
  
  Canned beans do not require additional cooking since they have been
  thoroughly cooked in the canning process, but there are several ways
  of preparing dry beans for cooking. All start with a thorough
  inspection for damaged beans and foreign material, then washing in
  cold water. The next step, which is highly recommended, is soaking
  the beans. This not only helps make the beans cook faster, it also
  improves flavor, texture, appearance and digestibility. For maximum
  improvement of these factors, it is recommended that the soak water
  be discarded and the beans rinsed and cooked in fresh water.
  
  SOAKING TIPS: Hot-soak (preferred) and Quick-soak method.
  
  For every pound of dry beans, any variety, add 10 cups of hot water.
  Remember beans will rehydrated to at least twice theri dry size, so
  be sure to start with a large enough pot. (Note: up to 2 teaspoons of
  salt per pound of beans *may* be added to help the beans absorb water
  more evenly.) Heat to boiling, let boil for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove
  from heat, cover and set aside for at least 1 hour (quick-soak
  method), but *preferably* four hours or more.  The longer soaking
  time is recommended to allow a greater amount of the gas-causing
  properties to dissolve in the water, thus helping the beans to be
  more easily digested and lessening the aftereffects. Whether you soak
  the beans for an hour or several hours, remember to DISCARD THE SOAK
  WATER.
  
  COOKING TIPS: (for each pound of dry beans)
  
  Standard method:  Drain and rinse soaked beans; put into a good- sized
  kettle.  Add 6 cup of hot water, 1 to 2 Tablespoons shortening and 2
  teaspoons salt. Boil gently with lid tilted until desired tenderness
  is reached.
  
  Savory Method:  Use standard method (above), but use 2 teaspoons
  onion salt and 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt instead of plain salt. Add 1
  Tablespoon chicken stock base or 3 to 4 bouillon cubes and 1/4
  teaspoon white pepper.
  
  * Simmer beans slowly.  Cooking too fast can break skins.
  
  * Acid slows down cooking.  Add tomatoes, vinegar, etc. last.
  
  * Add 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon baking soda (no more) per pound of beans whe
  cooking in hard water to shorten cooking time.
  
  * At high altitudes, beans take longer to cook.  A pressure cooker
  helps, but follow manufacturer's directions. [Personal note: Tom says
  1/2 hour in the pressure cooker at 15 lbs pressure is equivalent to
  cooking them overnight.  Don't put too many beans in the pressure
  cooker, as they expand:  you don't want to plug up the vent hole.)
  
  * Refried beans are made from freshly cooked pinto, pink, red or
  kidney beans, mashed and cooked in a skillet with bacon drippings,
  lard, oil, butter or margarine.

      1 pk Egg roll wrappers
           Or
      1    *recipe of cheese blintz pan
           Sesame oil
      1 c  Celery, finely chopped
      1    Onion, small, finely chopped
      2    Garlic cloves, minced
      1 c  Cabbage, finely shredded
      1 c  Mushroom, finely chopped
      1    Green pepper, finely chopped
    1/2 c  Water chestnuts, finely chop
      1 c  Sprouts, bean or seed, fresh
    1/4 c  Soybeans, dry cooked and
           -pureed
      3 tb Soy sauce
  2 1/2 c  Brown rice, cooked
 
  These egg rolls make an excellent first course, or when eaten right
  with the cooked rice, a whole meal. Just be sure, if you eat them
  without rice, that you include rice in the meal to complement the
  soybeans.
  
  In a wok or frying pan saute the vegetables in sesame oil in the order
  given.  After the onion has started sauteing, add the remaining
  vegetables quickly so that the total time with the heat on is about 5
  minutes. As soon as you add the bean sprouts to the pan, turn off the
  heat.
  
  Stir the pureed soybeans and soy sauce together.  Then stir this
  mixture into the vegetables.
  
  The whole mixture may be chilled several hours, or used warm. To
  prepare the rolls: place about 1/4 cup filling in the center of each
  pancake or egg roll wrapper; fold the corners over envelope-style and
  seal with a flour-water paste.
  
  Heat a large frying pan with oil in the bottom.  Fry the rolls until
  they are crisp and brown, turning only once. You may deep fry the
  rolls if you are into deep frying, but they are better cooked only in
  a little oil. Drain on paper bags or towels.
  
  Keep the rolls hot in a 250~ oven up to an hour.  Or reheat them at
  450~ for about 10 minutes.
  
  Serve 2 egg rolls with about 1 cup of cooked rice and any of the
  following: mustard, horseradish, soy sauce, sweet and sour sauce, or
  hot sauce.

  'muddiest' part of the liquid for this recipe. Use the beans in
  another recipe or freeze them for later use. Combine all the
  ingredients with cooled bean juice and stir over medium-low heat
  until thickened. Use a wire whisk or blender to mix well. Correct the
  seasonings to taste and serve this gravy over potatoes, rice, whole
  grains, vegetables, mock meat loaf, burgers or other dishes. MAKES: 2

      Title: VEGETARIAN HAM
 Categories: China, Vegetarian
      Yield: 1 Appetizer
 
      2 oz (3 sheets) dried bean curd
      3 tb Soy sauce
      2 tb Water
      1    Level teaspoon sugar
    1/2    Level teaspoon MSG
      1    Level teaspoon fennel
    1/2    Star anise
      2    Cloves, crushed
    1/2    Level teaspoons wild
           -pepper, crushed.
           -[Szechwan peppercorns S.C.]
 
  "The Buddhists, whether monks or ordinary people, mingled freely with
  the non-vegetarians, and because the manners of Chinese society are
  all-embracing and diffuse, felt obliged to provide food which looked
  and almost tasted like meat.  This was a sign of hospitality. Their
  cuisine was based on nuts, spices, vegetables, sauces, sesame, peanut
  and vegetables oils, and bean curd.  The last was the factotum, now
  appearing as duck, then as chicken, then as fish.  Its very lack of
  personality made it an excellent actor."
  
  Soak the bean curd in water for about 1/2 hour until soft. Mix
  together the remaining ingredients, and marinate the bean curd in
  this mixture for about 2 hours.
  
  Select the largest and smoothest sheet and lay it on a flat surface.
  Place the remaining sheets on top of it evenly, so that when rolled
  up it will form a cylinder of regular dimensions. Roll it up VERY
  tightly. Place it on a single piece of cheese-cloth or old sheet and
  roll it up, with the cloth overlapping both at both ends. Tie the
  bundle at both ends like a toy firecracker at the two points where
  the bean curd ends. Steam the roll for about 1 hour.  Cool the roll
  and unwrap it. Slice the roll into 1/4-inch slices and serve cold.

           -- chopped
      2 ts Salt
      2 c  Chopped seitan (optional)

MMMMM-----------------------MUSHROOM GRAVY----------------------------
     20 md Mushrooms
    1/2 c  Chopped onion
      1 tb Olive oil
    1/2 ts Dried oregano; -OR-
      2 ts -Fresh oregano
    1/3 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Unbleached flour
      2 c  -Lentil liquor (from above)
  1 1/2 c  Water
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Black pepper
 
  Cook the lentils, millet, and brown rice separately; and reserve two
  cups of the lentil liquor for making Mushroom Gravy. If you are using
  whole chestnuts, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Rinse the nuts
  and cut a cross about 1/2 inch deep in the small, pointed ends. Place
  the nuts on a cookie sheet and bake about 20 minutes, then cool for
  about 10 minutes. Remove the shells and cut the nuts in quarters.
  
  Mix the cooked grains and lentils with the nuts, bread crumbs, and
  almond butter in a large bowl and set aside.
  
  Saute the onions briefly in olive oil, then add the garlic, sage,
  celery seed, rosemary, salt, and seitan if used. Saute 2 to 3 minutes
  longer, stirring constantly, then add to the other ingredients, mix
  thoroughly (mooshing with fingers works best), and put into a large
  oiled baking dish. Lightly coat the top of the roast with olive oil,
  then bake at 350 degrees F for 1-1/4 hours.  Serve with Mushroom
  Gravy (below) and garnish with parsley.
  
  MUSHROOM GRAVY: Separate the mushroom caps from the stems, then
  quarter the caps and halve the stems. Saute the onion in olive oil on
  medium heat for 1 minute, then stir in the oregano and add the
  mushrooms. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mushrooms have
  softened and the bottom of the pan is covered with liquid.  Set aside.
  
  Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat, then stir in the
  flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the
  lentil liquor and water, and continue stirring until the mixture
  thickens and barely begins to boil.  Add the mushroom mixture, salt,
  and pepper, and continue stirring until the gravy begins to boil.
  Remove from heat and serve.

  First make the tomato sauce:  peel and mince onions. Saute onions in
  about 2 T oil and about 2 T butter, over moderate heat, until they
  are soft and lightly colored (about 8 minutes). Add mushrooms and
  saute. Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste, wine, parsley, seasonings and
  sugar.
  
  Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered, for 30-45 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.  Most of the liquid should be evaporated, and the
  mixture quite thick. Remove skillet from heat and let it cool
  completely.
  
  Start seasoning the eggplants:  peel eggplants and slice vertically,
  about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Sprinkle lightly with salt and let sit
  for 30 minutes.
  
  Now make the Bechamel Sauce:  Place the milk in a saucepan and heat
  it just until tiny bubbles appear along the edges. Remove and set
  aside.
  
  Melt one cube butter in a 3-quart saucepan over very low heat until
  foamy, being careful not to brown. Slowly add the 6 T flour, stirring
  constantly until smooth (3-4 minutes), and still being careful not to
  let it brown. Add the milk slowly, whipping with a wire whisk. When
  the mixture is thick and smooth, remove it from the heat and stir in
  seasonings. Cool sauce slightly.
  
  Back to the eggplant:  Rinse well with cold water; squeeze gently and
  pat dry.  Dredge the eggplant in about 1 1/2 cups flour and saute in
  olive oil.
  
  Put it all together:  Stir ricotta cheese until it is smooth and
  creamy. Gently fold it into the Bechamel sauce. Stir in beaten eggs
  until thoroughly incorporated.
  
  Remove and discard any excess oil that has risen to the top of the
  tomato mixture.
  
  Lightly grease a 16x10 baking pan and sprinkle the bottom with a few
  bread crumbs.  Place a layer of eggplant in the pan, following with a
  layer of tomato mixture. Sprinkle with bread crumbs and grated
  cheese. Repeat as many times as you have eggplant to last.
  
  Pour the Bechamel-ricotta sauce over the top and bake at 300 degrees
  F. for one hour, or until a golden-brown crust has formed on top.
  Remove moussaka from oven and let it stand undisturbed 20-30 minutes;
  the delay allows the layers to fuse.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Vegetarian version of the Greek classic -- This recipe is not for
  the faint-hearted.  It's very good and it takes a lot of work. Don't
  waste it on someone who would be just as satisfied with steak and
  salad!
  
  : Difficulty:  moderate.
  : Time:  1 1/2 hours to prepare, 1 hour to bake, 20-30 minutes to set
  and cool.  Some can be done ahead of time.
  : Precision:  Approximate measurement OK for eggplant, tomato mixture.

      Title: VEGETARIAN PAELLA
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/4 c  Olive oil
  1 1/4 c  Long-grain brown rice
      1 lg Onion; peeled and sliced
      2 lg Garlic cloves; crushed
      1 pn Saffron strands
      3 c  Light Vegetable Stock
           -(generous measure) OR water
    1/2    Lemon; thinly pared rind,
           - cut into thin shreds
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      1 lb Washed and trimmed leeks
           - cut into 1-inch lengths
    1/4 c  Frozen peas
    1/4 c  Black olives, or more

MMMMM-------------------------TO GARNISH------------------------------
           Parsley; chopped
 
  Heat the oil in a large, deep pan.  Add the long-grain brown rice and
  onion slices and stir until the rice is coated and begins to turn
  opaque. Add the garlic, saffron, stock or wate, lemon rind and salt
  and pepper. Mix well, then bring to a boil. Mix again, to distribute
  the saffron coloring. Arrange the vegetables and olives attractively
  on top of the rice. Bring to a boil.  Cover with a lid or foil and
  simmer for 45 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and serve straight from
  the pan. May be served with blanched almonds, slivered Brazil nuts or
  whole cashew nuts- separately, in a bowl - for people to help
  themselves to if they like. Variation: VEGETARIAN PAELLA WITH
  ARTICHOKES: Use 4 to 6 globe artichokes instead of the leeks. Very
  tender baby artichokes can simply be quartered; otherwise cut the
  leaves and choke from the artichokes, then halve or quarter the
  artichoke bottoms. Garnish with artichoke leaves.

      Title: VEGETARIAN POT STICKERS
 Categories: Digest, Feb95, Vegetarian
      Yield: 20 Servings
 
      4    Chinese dried black
           (shiitake) mushrooms, soaked
           In hot water
      1 c  Spinach leaves, chopped
    1/2 c  Napa cabbage, chopped
    1/2 c  Bamboo shoots, daikon or
           Fresh or canned water
           Chestnuts, chopped
    1/2 c  Pressed bean curd or tofu,
           Chopped (proven optional or
           Easily reduced)
      1 tb Green onion, minced
      1 ts Fresh ginger, minced
      2 ts Soy sauce
      1 ts Rice wine or dry sherry
      1 ts Cornstarch
    1/2 ts Sesame oil
      1 pn White or black pepper
      1 lb Pot sticker wrappers, or
           Homemade sheet pasta
      2 ts Vegetable oil
      2 c  Vegetable stock
 
  1. Squeeze excess water from mushrooms. Remove stems and discard;
  finely chop caps. Place mushrooms in a large bowl, and add spinach,
  cabbage, bamboo shoots, bean curd, green onion, ginger and garlic
  (and anything else you wish at this point-my friend added sprouts and
  put in less than half the tofu called for, and I'll probably add some
  fresh Japanese mustard leaves and Swiss chard stalks, and maybe some
  carrots bits, and leave out the tofu entirely). Mix gently with soy
  sauce, wine, cornstartch, sesame oil, and pepper. Refrigerate until
  ready to use.
  
  2. Spoon 1 Tablespoon of filling into the center of each pot sticker
  wrapper (friend said she's going to stuff them a little fuller next
  time). Moisten edge of wrapper, fold over to make a half-circle, and
  pleat edges firmly together. Set each pot sticker upright on a
  platter, so that a flat base is formed.
  
  3. In a large non-stick or cast iron skillet, heat the 2 teaspoons of
  vegetable oil on medium high. Place pot stickers close together in
  the pan and fry about 1 minute, or until bottoms begin to brown. Pour
  enough vegetable stock into the pan to cover bottom half of pot
  stickers. Cover pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook 7 minutes, until
  the stock evaporates.
  
  Makes about 20 pot stickers.
  
  "Dip these in bowls of soy sauce, rice vinegar, hot chili pepper oil,
  and fermented black bean sauce."

      Title: VEGETARIAN ROAST
 Categories: None, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  8 1/2 oz Long grain rice
      7 oz Button mushrooms, finely
           -chopped
      5 oz Whole grain bread crumbs
      5 oz Nuts (any kind such as
           -almonds, brazil nuts or
           -unsalted peanuts), chopped
      5 oz Low fat mozzarella cheese
      4    Eggs
      4 md Carrots, grated
      3 md Onions, chopped
    1/4 c  Sunflower or safflower oil
    1/4 c  Dried parsley
    1/2 ts Ground black pepper
    1/4 ts Garlic powder
 
  **  Procedure  **
  
  1) Cook the rice in boiling water for 30 to 35 minutes, until tender,
  or use an automatic rice cooker. 250g of rice is about 2 small
  automatic rice cooker cups, but please check your rice cooker to be
  sure. When using an automatic rice cooker, add a little more water
  for brown rice than you would for white. ie. if you cook 2 small rice
  cooker cups of brown rice, then fill the rice cooker pot to the 3
  level with water.
  
  2) Thoroughly blend everything in a large bowl or pot. Then pack the
  mixture into 2 medium sized (1.4 l or 1.4 quarts) loaf tins, which
  have been lightly oiled.
  
  3) Bake at 350F (180C) for 1 to 1 1/4 hours or until firm to touch and
  brown on top. Vegetarian Roast is traditionally served, hot or cold,
  with tomato sauce or chutney.
  
  :          **  Variations  **
  
  Fry the onions, carrots, and mushrooms, in the oil until softened,
  before adding them to the entire mixture in step #2. Serve with a
  legume soup, such as pea soup or lentil stew. Replace the eggs with a
  commercial egg substitute. Replace the mushrooms with green, red, or
  yellow peppers. Replace the mozzarella with cheddar cheese (the older
  the stronger the flavour). Replace the mushrooms with green, red, or
  yellow peppers.

      1    Free Flow Recipe
 
  The next few recipes are from a big, fat cookbook that would be
  several volumes if they had not used the somewhat unappealing format
  in which the recipes are presented. The book is pretty no frills,
  with little background given for the dishes.  Almost everything that
  I've tried from the book has been good, though. Here we get into some
  hard- core, no-fooling Chinese vegetarian recipes.  The book has a
  lot of vegetarian stuff in it, as well as recipes tailored for
  diabetics and those with ulcer problems. It's actually pretty easy to
  use once you get used to the odd format.
  
  A. 1 tablespoon peanut oil B. 4 large mushrooms C. 1 cup finely
  shredded bamboo shoots D. 2 teaspoons light soy sauce E. 1/2 teaspoon
  sugar F. 1/2 teaspoon salt G. 1 tablespoon mushroom water H. 1 1/2
  teaspoons cornstarch I. 1 teaspoon sugar J. 2 teaspoons light soy
  sauce K. 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil L. 1/2 teaspoon salt M. 1
  tablespoons mushroom water N. 4 pieces fresh bean curd skin O. 2 cups
  peanut oil
  
  PREPARATION:
  
  I.  Wash B and soak in warm water for 15 minutes; drain and save
  water; shred B very fine.
  
  II.  Mix D,E,F,G.
  
  III.  Mix H,I,J,K,L,M.
  
  COOKING: 1. Heat A, add B, stir-fry a few seconds, add C, mix well.
  
  2.  Add D-G, stir well and cook for 1 minute.
  
  3.  Dip pastry brush into H-M and brush 1 piece of N generously.
  
  4.  Spread 1/4 of A-G on top; place second piece of N over this; brush
  again with H-M and spread 1/4 A-G over this.
  
  5.  Repeat procedure until fourth layer is finished.
  
  6.  Fold into a 2-to 3-inch roll; place on a plate and steam over
  boiling water for 10 minutes; cool completely
  
  7.  Heat O to 375F; deep fry A-N until golden brown (1 to 2 minutes),
  cool. Slice and serve as hors d'oeuvres or serve with rice.

      Title: VEGETARIAN SALAMI (VEGAN)
 Categories: Digest, Dec., Vegetarian
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
      1 lb Firm Chinese-style tofu
      1 qt Water
           Tempeh marinade (see
           Recipe)
      1    Garlic clove, thinly sliced
    1/8 ts Ground black pepper
 
  1. Drain the tofu and slice it into four equal pieces. Place the tofu
  and water in a saucepan, bring to a boil, and cook for 7 minutes.
  Drain and cut into slices about 1/8 inch thick. Lay slices in one
  layer on a clean, thick kitchen towel. Cover with another thick
  kitchen towel and lay some heavy books on top to press out the water.
  Let stand for 30 minutes.
  
  2.  Prepare the Tofu Marinade and add the garlic and black pepper to
  it at the end. Pour a little marinade into a flat-bottomed container
  that has a lid that seals and lay one layer of tofu in it. Cover with
  marinade and add another layer of tofu. Repeat until all the tofu and
  marinade are used up. Refrigerate for two days. If the marinade does
  not cover the tofu, turn container upside-down for half the time. The
  tofu can remain in the marinade for up to four days. The longer it
  soaks, the stronger it will be. If you prefer the slices to be drier,
  remove them from the marinade and lay them in one layer on a dish in
  the refrigerator for several hours. After the tofu has been removed
  from the marinade, store it wrapped or covered in the refrigerator
  for up to two days, or wrap tightly and freeze.
  
  3. Use in sandwiches as you would use cold cuts, or cut up in salads.
  
  Makes 1 pound, or 24 slices.

  Preheat the oven to 350 F.  Saut‚ the onion and garlic in oil.
  Combine the beans, tomato paste, and seasonings (omit the seasonings
  or adjust to suit your taste if you are using canned, seasoned
  refried beans). Add the onion and garlic, and the green pepper and
  olives.
  
  For the crust, stir the cornmeal into one cup of cold water, then into
  boiling salted water. Cook and stir until the mixture is thick.
  
  Grease an eight-inch square pan.  Spread a little more than half of
  the cornmeal in the bottom of the pan. Pour the filling over the
  crust and spread evenly. Spoon the remaining cornmeal on top, and
  spread a bit (but it won't cover the whole top). Sprinkle the grated
  Cheddar on top. Bake for 35 minutes at 350 F. This will be easier to
  serve if you let it stand for ten minutes before cutting.

      Yield: 36 Servings
 
      3 oz Dried corn husks
      1 c  TVP granules or flakes
    7/8 c  Hot water
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/2 c  Onion, chopped small
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
      1    Green pepper, chopped small
      1 tb Chili powder
      2 ts Cumin
    1/2 ts Garlic salt
    1/2 c  Tomato puree
           Dash of cayenne
      2 c  Masa harina
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Margarine or oil
 
   Soak the dried corn husks in cold water for 1 hour.
  
   For the filling, soak the TVP in 7/8 c. hot water for 5 minutes.
  Saute the olive oil, onion, garlic and green pepper in a skillet.
  
   Add the chili powder, cumin, garlic salt, tomato puree and cayenne
  to the reconstituted TVP. Mix TVP and onions and heat together for 2
  minutes. Taste the filling and add a little hot sauce, if desired.
  
   To make the masa dough, place the masa harina and salt into a bowl.
  Slowly add enough warm water (about 1 1/2 cups) to make a firm but
  moist dough, working in the margarine or oil as you knead the mixture.
  
   To form the tamales, use the palm of your hand to slap-pat the masa
  dough into flat patties a quarter-inch thick. Fold patty around a
  spoonful of filling and place in a drained corn husk. Fold the husk
  over to enclose the filling. If husks are small or broken, use
  several pieces. Place 1 cup hot water in thebottom of a kettle, place
  a steamer rack in the kettle and stack tamales on rack. Cover pan,
  bring water to a boil, reduce heat and steam tamales 45 minutes. You
  may want to cook them in two batches, depending on the size of your
  steamer.
  
   Makes 36-40 tamales.

      1 ea Onions
      1 ea Leeks
      1 ea Carrots
      1 ea Celery
      1 ea Apple
      1 ea Garlic
      1 ea Mushrooms
      1 ea Ginger
      1 ea Lemon grass (opt)
      1 ea Peelings & tired old
           Vegetables
      1 ea Parsely
      1 ea Peppercorns
      1 ea Fresh or dried herbs (thyme,
           Dill, allspice)
      1 ea Water to cover by two
           Inches
 
  Cut in big chunks (maybe quarters) a couple onions, leeks, several
  carrots, some celery ribs and an apple. Toss them with several cloves
  of garlic, some mushrooms (old, shriveled ones are the best), a few
  slices of fresh ginger (peel and all), lemon grass is good if you
  have it and a couple sprays of pam. Roast all this is 500 degree oven
  for about 20 minutes until very brown. (This kind of carmelizes them,
  and they develop a sweetness).
  
  After roasting, put them in a stockpot, and add all the peelings and
  trimmings you've saved up. plus any veggies you've had around long
  enough they're beginning to look a little tired. (Or fresh ones,
  too!) A bunch of parsely is nice, peppercorns, sprigs of dried or
  fresh herbs (thyme is especially good), maybe some dill seeds, a
  couple of whole allspices, and enough water to cover everything by 2
  inches.
  
  Bring to a boil, simmer for 20-30 minutes (I've let it go a lot
  longer, too), fish out the vegies, strain, and you have great stock
  for soup, sauteeing, cooking pasta or rice and whatever else.
  
  The great thing about this, is the recipe really doesn't matter, just
  the main principles. Use whatever vegies you've got and like (or get
  rid of some you don't). The roasting and the apple (or pear) seem to
  be key. The rest is pure invention.
  
  Source: I'm very enthusiastic about vegetable stock. I've been making
  mt own for several years, now and I think it's great. I got a couple
  of ideas from the owner of a Seattle restaunt called Dahlia.

      Title: VEGGIE BURGER MIX
 Categories: Vegetables, August
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Dry garbanzo beans
    1/2 c  Dry soybeans
    1/2 c  Dry lentils
    1/2 c  Yellow split peas
    1/2 c  Instant brown rice
    1/2 c  Rolled oats
      1 pk Dry soup mix or
           Salad dressing mix
    1/4 c  Bread crumbs
    1/4 c  Cornmeal
  1 1/2 ts Baking soda
 
  Put the ingredients one by one in a blender.  Turn on the blender.
  Run for cover (it's pretty noisy).  When everything is reduced to
  powder, combine i a container. To use, mix 1 cup of the mix with 2/3
  cup HOT water or combination of water and BBQ sauce, water and wine,
  or whatever other liqui you can think of. Let sit 15 minutes, then
  form into 3 patties. Cook in a pan coated with nonstick spray. NOTE:
  If you use BBQ sauce as part of the liquid, they wi brown much faster
  ~ must be the sugar in the sauce. This recipe makes 4 cu of dry mix.
  
   The variations for this are endless, as you can use different dry
  mixes. Good Seasons makes fat free dry salad dressing mixes, and
  there are lots of different flavors of soup mix (I think onion soup
  would be good). You coul also use the dry seasoning mixes, like the
  taco seasoning, etc. Some of the are fairly high in sodium, but I
  would think that in a quantity of mix, it would average out to an
  acceptable level.

      1 cn Red kidney beans, drained.
           (the mid-sized can)
      1 cn Chick peas, drained. (same
           Size)

      1 ea Garlic cloves to taste
      2    To 3 cups frozen vegetables.
           (I used corn)
    1/2    To 1 cup grated ff cheese
           (optional)
      1 ea Cooked couscous or other
           Grain of choice
 
  Combine all ingredients in large casserole dish, and bake in 400F
  oven for 45 mins.
  
  You may add 1/2- 1 cup grated ff cheese the last ten minutes of
  cooking, but I don't think it really needs it.
  
  Serve over couscous (or any other grain you like)
  
  It was rather liquid, next time, I think I will drain the tomatoes,
  reserving liquid, and adding until it "looks right"

      Title: VEGGIE FLAVORED PASTA - NO EGG
 Categories: Vegetarian, Low-fat, Pasta
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
MMMMM---------------------BASIC INGREDIENTS--------------------------
      1 c  Flour, all purpose
           Preferably durum semolina
    1/3 c  Water

MMMMM--------------------OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS-------------------------
      1 tb Olive oil (optional)
           Use one of following only:
    1/4 c  Tomato Juice (for red)
    1/3 c  Carrot Puree (for orange)
    1/3 c  Beet Puree (for red)
      1 c  Spinach puree (for green)
 
  To make by hand, use a floured pastry cloth, put dry ingredients on
  cloth, and make a "well" in the center of flour mixture, add liquid
  ingredients in the well, and knead the dough, working the flour to
  the center as you knead. After it forms a ball, knead by hand for
  several minutes. To make with a food processor, put all ingredients
  in the bowl. Process for 1 minute until dough begins to form. Adjust
  liquid or flour if necessary, continue to knead in the machine for
  1-1/2 to 2-1/2 minutes. To make with bread machine, place ingredients
  into baking pan. Use the dough cycle, knead for 1/2 min. Adjust flour
  and liquid to form a round ball of dough. Knead for another 5
  minutes, then press stop button. IF YOU HAVE A PASTA MACHINE,
  CONTINUE ACCORDING TO INSTRUCTIONS. To complete the pasta by hand,
  roll the dough into sheets, as thin as it is possible to roll it on a
  floured pastry cloth with a rolling pin. Then shape into long thin
  spaghetti like strips, or wider for noodles. Cut with a pie crimper
  for a fancy edge and twist into bowknots. Use your imagination. Allow
  to dry a minimum of 10-20 minutes, or longer, if necessary. It may be
  dried for several hours, put into a ziploc bag and refrigerated or
  frozen. To cook, drop into boiling water (with a little salt,
  optional), and cook just until al dente.  Do not overcook. Serve with
  your favorite sauce. You can make a white pasta, leaving out the
  vegetables, or you can use your imagination, be creative, and use any
  number of other veggies. Try green, yellow, red, purple, orange
  pepper puree; yellow summer squash or zucchini; winter squash,
  pumpkin or sweet potato; broccoli, green beans, vegetarian refried
  beans.  The list is endless. Just use approximately one-third cup of
  the one you choose.

    1/2 c  Salt-reduced soy sauce or
           -tamari
    1/2 c  Nutritional yeast
      1 lg Onion diced
    1/2 tb Garlic powder
      1 tb Each Oregano and Basil,
           -dried
      1 ts Liquid smoke (optional)
           -Mushrooms, fresh or canned
           -(optional) 1/4 c to 1 c
  4 1/2 c  Old fashioned rolled oats
 
  Bring all ingredients except the oats to a boil.  Turn heat to low
  and stir in 4.5 cups rolled oats.  Cook for about 5 minutes until the
  water is absorbed. Don't overcook. If it is too soupy, add some oats
  at about 5 minutes and cook for only a few more minutes until
  thickened. Fill a rectangular non-stick baking pan with the mixture
  (makes square patties, easier than forming little circles). The pan
  could be anywhere from 9 x 18 inches (22.5 X 45 cm.), 12 inches (30
  cm.) square or larger to make patties about a half-inch (1.3 cm.)
  thick. If too thin they'll be tough and will dry out. Total cooking
  time is 45 minutes. Bake at 350 F. for 25 minutes. Then use a utensil
  that won't scratch your pan to cut the giant burger into 3.5" to 4"
  (10 cm.) square burgers and flip them over. Cook another 20 minutes.
  Serve in buns or as a main course, hot or cold. Can be frozen.

    1/2 c  Grated zucchini
      1 c  Sliced steamed carrots

      3 oz Shredded cheddar cheese
    1/2 c  Tomato sauce
      1    Egg
      1    Egg white
    1/4 ts Each salt, pepper and sage
    1/2 ts Dried thyme
    1/4 c  Chopped parsley
      6 tb Grated Parmesan Cheese
 
  1.  Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
  
  2.  In small skillet heat olive oil and saute onion
    until translucent, about 5 minutes.
  
  3.  In large bowl combine zucchini, carrot, broccoli,
    oatmeal, breadcrumbs, oat bran and cheese.
  
  4.  In small bowl beat together tomato sauce, egg and
    egg white, seasonings and Parmesan.
  
  5.  Combine all ingredients and stir thoroughly to mix.
  
  6.  Turn mixture into 9x5-inch loaf pan coated with
    non-stick spray.
  
  7.  Bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until firm.  Let stand
       15    minutes before slicing.
  
  Why the sudden interest in oat bran?  Oat bran is the fibrous outer
  layer of the oat grain, which is generally removed when the grain is
  processed into oatmeal. Now that we know the importance of fiber in a
  well balanced diet, it is a good practice to put some of that oat
  bran back into our food.

      Yield: 1 Batch
 
      1 lg Cucumber
      3 tb Sesame oil
      1 ts Black mustard seeds
      1 ts Urad dal, white
    1/2 ts Methi (fenugreek)
      2    Dried red chillies
    1/2 tb Tamcon paste
      1 pn Hing
           Salt; to taste
 
  Peel cucumber, slit into half, scoop out seeds. Slit into further
  narrow strips and cut tiny pieces as for kachumbar. Should not be
  grated as this gives no 'bite' feel in the mouth.
  
  Next, warm the oil and fry all ingredients except the tamarind.
  Mustard should stop spluttering and dal/methi should turn brown.
  Drain out these fried spices into a blender, leaving oil behind in
  pan.
  
  Add cucumber and stir fry for two minutes, no more.
  
  Add tamcon to spices in blender and with half the cucumber run on low
  speed till everything looks coarsely ground and blended. Remove into
  a bowl, add remaining cucumber pieces and mix well.

      Title: VELOUTE OF FENNEL
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
     10 tb Unsalted butter
      6 lg Heads fennel
           - trimmed and thinly sliced
      6 tb Unbleached all-purpose flour
      8 c  Chicken stock
           - preferably homemade
      4    Egg yolks
    3/4 c  Whipping cream
           Salt
           Pepper
           Chopped fresh chives
           - for garnish
 
  MELT 4 TABLESPOONS OF BUTTER in a large, heavy skillet over medium
  heat. Add the fennel, cover and slowly braise, stirring occasionally,
  until the fennel is completely softened and lightly browned, about 30
  minutes. Transfer it to a food processor fitted with a steel blade
  and puree. Set aside. Melt the remaining butter in a heavy large
  saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the flour and stir with a wooden
  spoon until the flour is cooked but still light in color, 3-to-4
  minutes. Slowly add the stock to the flour mixture, stirring
  constantly. Bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and
  simmer gently for 30 minutes. Stir in the fennel, then pass the soup
  through a fine strainer, if desired. (The soup may be prepared ahead
  of time, to this point.) Just before serving, bring the soup to a
  simmer. Combine the egg yolks and cream in a small bowl, and beat
  well. Gradually add about 2 cups of soup to the yolk mixture. Slowly
  blend the yolk mixture back into the remaining soup. Be careful not
  to let the soup boil or the eggs will curdle. Season to taste with
  salt and pepper. Ladle into warm bowls and garnish with chives.

      Title: VELOUTE SOUP BASE
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 tb Butter
    3/4 c  Minced onion and/or white of
           -leek (recipe says
           3/4 cup to 1-1/2 cups of thi
           -s mixture)
    1/4 c  Flour
      8 c  Chicken or fish stock and/or
           -milk or vegetable
           Cooking liquid (recipe calls
           -for 7 to 8 cups)
           Salt
           White pepper; freshly groun
           -d
 
      In a saucepan over moderately low heat, melt butter and stir in
  the onions.  Cover and cook slowly until the onions are transparent.
  Blend in the flour. Stir slowly for 3 minutes, to cook the flour
  without letting it color.  Remove from heat and, when bubbling stops,
  pour in 1 cup of hot liquid all a once, whisking vigorously to blend
  smoothly. Whisk in 6 more cups. Bring to a simmer, stirring, and
  simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
      The soup base should coat a spoon lightly; add dollops of more
  liquid if too thick. Correct seasoning, and continue as your recipes
  directs.
  
  Makes about 2 quarts.
  
  Suggestion:  Use with Upperline's Ancho Crab Soup or Flagon's Cream of
  Mushroom and Brie Soup.

  The term "velvet" denotes a method of poaching chicken breast to turn
  it white and make the texture very soft and smooth.Care must be taken
  to use simmering liquid for just long enough to cook the chicken
  through.Boiling water or prolonged poaching will toughen the texture.
  
  Velvet chicken:  Heat 6 cups of water to boil. Reduce to simmer.
  Remove skin from chicken breast; cut breast into 1" chunks.Simmer in
  uncovered pan for 3-5 minutes, until meat is cooked through.
  
  Sauce: In wok or sauce pan, heat chicken stock, sherry, ginger juice,
  sugar & salt. When sauce is very hot, slowly add condensed milk or
  cream. Stir to combine. DON'T ALLOW SAUCE TO BOIL. Dribble in corn-
  starch paste to thicken. Enrich with sesame oil. Add chicken before
  serving to reheat.
  
  Rice stick: Heat oil in wok for deep-frying until hot enough to puff
  up rice stick but not brown it. Fry in small batches; drain. Process

      Title: VELVET UNDERGROUND CAKE
 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 oz Unsweetened chocolate
      2 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
    3/4 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Hot strong brewed coffee or
      5 ts Instant coffee powder
           Dissolved in 1 C. hot water
    1/2 c  Sour cream, at room
           -temperature
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      2 lg Eggs, lightly beaten, room
           -temperature
 
  Preheat oven to 345.  Lightly grease two 8-in. layer cake pans with
  oil or butter, or line them with parchment circles. Melt chocolate in
  top of double boiler placed over simmering water, then turn off the
  heat. Sift sugar, flour, baking soda and salt together into a large
  mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, blend the hot coffee, sour cream,
  and vegetable oil with whisk.
  
  With the mixer on low speed, add the coffee mixture in a stream to
  the dry ingredients and mix until blended, about 35 seconds. Stop
  mixer to scrape the bowl several times with spatula. Add eggs one at
  a time and mix on medium-low speed after each addition until smooth,
  about 15 seconds. Scrape bowl each time. Add chocolate and mix until
  batter is uniform in color, about 10 seconds.
  
  Divide batter evenly between pans and  place on center rack in oven.
  Bake until cake springs back to touch and tester comes out dry (do
  not wait for crust to form), 35 to 38 minutes. Cool layers in the
  pans on a rack.
  
  Fudge Filling
  
  2 oz. unsweetened chocolate 2 T. unsalted butter 5 T. plus 1 1/2 tsp.
  sugar 6 T. hot water 1/2 tsp. vanilla
  
  Place all ingredients except vanilla in top of double boiler over
  simmering water and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the
  chocolate is melted and sugar dissolved, about 30 minutes. Mixture
  will be smooth and velvety. Pour fudge into small bowl, stir in
  vanilla and refrigerate until the mixture is thick and of spreading
  consistency, 2 hours.
  
  Buttercream
  
  8 T. unsalted butter, room temperature 1 1/4 C. confectioner's sugar
  3/4 C. plus 2 T. heavy (whipping) cream, chilled
  
  Place all ingredients in a food processor and process until light and
  fluffy, about 5 minutes. Stop mixer several times to scrape down
  sides of bowl. Transfer buttercream to medium-size mixing bowl and,
  using the paddle attachment of an electric mixer, continue to beat on
  medium-high speed, until buttercream is white and fluffy, 15 to 20
  minutes. Stop mixer to scrape bowl several times. (If you don't have
  a paddle attachment, use whisk.)  Use buttercream within an hour or
  it will need rewhipping.
  
  Assembly
  
  Spread all interior layers of cake with fudge filling and outside of
  cake with about 1 1/2 C. of buttercream. Shave 1 oz. dark chocolate
  over surface of cake with a fine grater, then use the knife method of
  shaving to make darker accents on the top of the cake. Makes 12 to 16
  servings.
  
  Enjoy!

  boil. Add a quarter cup of milk either regular or skimmed) and bring
  to boil again.  To add texture to the mix, add diced potatoes and
  carrots. *Serve with a pinch of dried tarragon*. A a dollop of no fat
  yogurt adds additional smoothness.

  potato. You may also substitute frozen corn or peas.

  cups of olive oil and the red pepper strips in a deep heavy skillet
  or saute pan. Heat slowly. Cook very gently until the peppers are
  extremely tender but not at all browned. (The oil will turn a lovely
  rose color.)  Set peppers aside. Pour the remaining oil into another
  skillet with the garlic pieces. Stew the garlic slowly for 4 to 5
  minutes, until tender and golden. Scoop out the garlic with a
  strainer or slotted spoon and add it to the peppers. Heat the garlic

  shrimp. Saute, tossing the shrimp in the oil, until they turn pink
  and are just done. To serve, spoon the peppers and their oil into a
  serving dish. Surround with the shrimp.  Serve with bread.  Each
  diner soaks slices of bread in the oil and piles the bread with
  peppers and garlic. Feta cheese may be eaten with it and the shrimp

      6 c  Unbleached flour
  1 1/2 c  Buttermilk
      4 tb Butter or margarine
      4 tb Honey
    1/2 ts Salt
      1    Package of yeast
    1/4 c  Warm water
      3 c  Grated cheese

           Oregano
           Garlic powder
           Pepper
           Thyme
 
  First, measure flour into large bowl.  In a separate container combine
  buttermilk, butter, honey and salt. Heat the buttermilk mixture to
  lukewarm.  Dissolve yeast in warm water. Add yeast and milk mixture to
  flour and combine to make a firm dough.  Turn dough out and kneed for
  about 6 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic. Put the dough in
  a greased bowl, cover and let rise until double in bulk, about 1
  hour. While dough is rising, prepare the toppings.  Grate plenty of
  cheese. Chop some onions and some wild chive if you have some handy.
  Fry venison, crumbling it as you fry.  When dough has risen, punch it
  down, divide it in half, and roll out the two parts to fit your
  baking sheets. The dough should be about 1/4-inch thick.  Let the
  rolled out dough rise for about 15 minutes. Spread a generous amount
  of pizza sauce on the dough. Sprinkle on plenty of oregano, garlic
  powder, pepper and a little thyme. Top with grated cheese and the
  crumbled venison.  Bake at 350F for 20 to 30 minutes.

  that the bag fits inside the pan). To the bag, add the venison. Add
  all liquids, then veggies around the meat. Put the 'shrooms on top of
  everything else, then the spices on top of them. You want to have

  add a little water (or white wine!).
  
  Seal bag. Poke several small holes in top of bag to let steam escape.
  Bake at 300-325 for 3-1/2 hours. (If you chop the veggies big, they

  Sweet Sauce:--Melt some white or red currant jelly with a glass of
  white or red wine, whichever suits best in color; or serve jelly
  unmelted in a small sweetmeat-glass.  This sauce answers well for
  hare, fawn, or kid, and for roast mutton to many tastes.

  shanks of mutton thus:  broil the meat on a quick fire till it is
  browned, then stew it slowly. Skim, strain, and serve the gravy it
  yields, adding salt and a teaspoonful of walnut pickle.

 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      2 lb Venison Roast (Boneless)
    1/2 c  White Wine
    1/8 c  Worcestershire Sauce
      1 c  Lentils
      1 ea Large cucumber, diced
      1 ea Jalepeno pepper, diced
      6 ea Med bannana peppers, chopped
      4 ea Small potatoes, quartered
      1 ea Indiv box of Fiber One
      1 pk Top Ramen Beef fl.noodles
      4 ea Triscuit Snack Crackers
    1/4 pk Ranch Dip Mix(-sourcream)
 
  Do not skin, peel, or otherwise denude the vegetables or potatoes.
  Wash them briskley and then cut them up. The good stuff is in the
  skin, always, as the skin is what was intended to serve, protect and
  defend the pulp and seeds. Fill large crock pot half full of clean
  cold water. Add ingredients. Let cook on low heat for 12-16 hours.
  Season as desired during last 1 hour of cooking, adding bay, etc., as
  suits your individual collection of buds. This recipe may be done
  with any game animal, except that squirrel tends to be far too
  stringy for my taste. If you like hearty and thick, this stew is for
  you.  It would also go well with beef, obviously.
    I do recommend a bay leaf added to the top for the last hour.

 Categories: Game
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
    1/2 tb Butter
           Black pepper
     50 g  Chopped green onions
    200 ml Port wine
    300 ml Stock
     24    Peeled chestnuts
      1 tb Butter
      8    Venison medallions
      4    Figs
 
  By rights, this dish requires lengthy preparation of a stock made
  with the bones and trimmings of venison. However, this is impossible
  for most of us who buy venison as a boneless fillet.
  
  A good beef stock is a satisfactory substitute and if you use a
  canned beef bouillon (Campbells makes one) and prepare the chestnuts
  in advance, the meal can be prepared very rapidly.
  
  Melt half a tablespoon of butter in a heavy saucepan, add a good
  grinding of black pepper and gently cook 50 g chopped green (spring)
  onions. Add 200 mL port and reduce. Add 300 mL stock and 24 peeled
  chestnuts and simmer for about 20 minutes or until the sauce becomes
  syrupy. Set aside and keep warm.
  
  Heat a heat a heavy-based frying pan, add a tablespoon of butter.
  When it is very hot, cook 8 medallions of venison, each about 1 cm
  thick.
  
  Sear them for a maximum of 1 minute on each side, to ensure they are
  still rare.
  
  Meanwhile, butter a baking tray and slice onto it 4 figs. Place under
  a grill to heat through.
  
  Divide the sauce and chestnuts between four heated plates and add to
  each plate 2 medallions of venison and a fan of fig slices. Serve
  immediately.

      6    Juniper berries; crushed fin
      2    Allspice berries; crushed fi
      1 ts Dijon mustard
    1/4 ts Paprika
      2 oz Dill pickles; diced
 
  Recipe by: plgold@ix.netcom.com (Pat Gold) * preferably from the game
  being used, commercial ok
  
  Notes: Prepare wild mushroom game sauce.
  
  STEAKS:
  
  Do not overcook the venison here.  It should be done no more than
  medium rare in the center.  This perparation does not require
  marinading, because the tenderness of the loin meat. Serve with
  quick-sauteed potatoes with dill sauce, and Stag's Leap Cabernet.
  
  1.  Pound the steaks to 1/2-inch thickness.  Sprinle lightly with the
  juniper berries and salt.
  
  2.  Saute the steaks with the butter for about 3 minutes on each
  side. The meat should be done no more than medium rare.
  
  3.  Heat the wild mushroom game sauce, adjust for salt, pour over the
  steks, and serve.
  
  SAUCE:
  
  This sauce is excellent for furred game, especially if the meat has
  not been marinated.  It is very much in the traditional European
  Hunter's Style, which uses juinper berries and pickles. It was
  developed through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries by cooks
  working on the great landed-gentry estates of France, Poland and
  Germany.
  
  1.  Clean mushrooms thoroughly under brisk running water.
  
  2.  Combine the mushrooms and about 2 cups of water in a saucepan, and
  bring to a boil.  Then reduce the heat, and let simmer for 30 minutes.
  Remove reconstituted mushrooms from broth, and set aside for later
  addition to sauce.
  
  3.  Prepare a roux:  Saute the onions in the butter until they are
  almost traansparent; add the flour, and stir for 1 minute.
  
  4.  Add the simmered mushroom extract, strained meat stock, and red
  wine to the roux mixture, and stir till blended and slightly
  thickened. Season with salt and pepper.
  
  5.  Add juniper berries, allspice, mustard, paprika, reconstituted
  mushrooms, and dill pickles.  Simmer for 5 minutes. Add salt and
  pepper. The sauce is now ready to use.
  
  Serves 4.

        2 TB oil

      1/2 ts paprika
        1 ds allspice
  
  Brown the cubed meat in the oil, add two cups of water, then the rest
  of the ingredients.  Cover and simmer 1 1/2 hours. Remove bay leaves,
  add carrots and potatoes, cook another 30-45 minutes or until tender.
  As a footnote, I've just browned the meat, then dumped everything in
  the "crockpot" on low.  It produces a stew that tastes as tho' it
  already been reheated several times.  IMHO, that's the best stew.

      Title: VENISON WITH CURRANTS & CHANTERELLES
 Categories: Other meat
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb Venison meat, boned; cubed o
      2 c  Veal stock; or water
      3 c  Red wine
      1 tb Dried onion; crushed
      2    Cl Garlic; crushed
      1 ts Salt
      1 lb Fresh currants; --or--
      1 c  Currant jelly
      4 oz Fresh chanterelles; or 2 oz.
      2 tb Arrowroot
           Mixed w. 1/3 cup water
 
  Recipe by: plgold@ix.netcom.com (Pat Gold) 1. "Hot-marinade" the
  venison by combining it with the water or stock, wine, onion, garlic,
  and salt, and bring all these ingredients to a boil. Let them simmer,
  covered, for 1 hour, or until the venison is tender.
  
  2.  Add currants or currant jelly and chanterelles, and bring back to
  a boil.  Thicken with the arrowroot-and-water mixture. The use of
  currant jelly instead of fresh currants will make a slightly sweeter
  sauce. Adjust for salt, and serve with rice.
  
  Notes: Currants are a favorite in European cooking because they
  combine fruitiness with acidity. Chanterelles are the best mushrooms
  to use with game because of their almost fruitlike flavor.
  
  Serve with apricot rice and a Sterling Vineyards Merlot.
  
  Serves 4.

 Categories: Russian, Dumplings, Cheese, Cottage, Noodles
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 c  Flour
    3/4 ts Baking powder
  1 1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2    8 oz. glasses COLD water
      1 lb Dry cottage cheese sm curd
    1/2 ts Salt
      1    Egg
 
  Add enough water to make a soft noodle like dough. Knead until well
  mixed. Divide dough into 2 balls. Set one aside. Roll into large
  circle about 1/8/ inch thick. Cut into 3 inch squares. Fill with the
  following.
  
  Mix together well.
  
  When filling "Pillows", make sure you place 1 tsp of cottage cheese
  mixture in dead center of dough square being VERY careful you don't
  get any cheese on the edge. You'll NEVER get the little suckers to
  seal!!! Any way, they should come out looking like little pillows.
  Pinch edges closed with your fingers. Another tip...don't roll the
  dough out TOO thin or else you will get lot's of leaks.
  
  Boil pillow in large kettle to which a tsp of salt has been added. It
  would be a good idea to not cook more than 5 or 6 at a time lest they
  stick together on the kettle. The pillows will be done when they rise
  to the top and puff up.  They also take on a yellowish cast (about 7
  mins. per batch). Remove from pot with a slotted spoon very
  carefully!!! Place them in a bowl with a stick of butter (don't even
  attempt this recipe if you try to use low fat healthy junk!!!). Serve
  hot with salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Another variation is to fill with black cherries. Cook and butter as
  with the cottage cheese pillows. Sprinkle with granulated sugar.

 Categories: Sauces
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/4 lb Large white onions,
           -quartered
    1/2 lb Fresh Jamaican chiles (also
           -called Scotch bonnets),
           Cored and quartered (See
           -Note)
      4 oz Fresh ginger, peeled
    1/4 c  Ground allspice
    1/4 c  Fresh thyme leaves
      3 tb Freshly ground black pepper

      1    Chicken (4 to 6 pounds),
           -well rinsed, patted dry,
           And cut into 6 pieces
 
  This pungent Jamaican sauce can be used to marinate pork butts (makes
  em run faster), beef round roasts, porgies, red snapper, as well as
  chicken. Says Vernon, "You can even use my sauce like ketchup. One
  guy pours it on his scrambled eggs." The sauce keeps well in the
  refrigerator tightly covered.
  
  JERK SAUCE
  
  * Pulverize the onions, chiles, and ginger in a blender or food
  processor. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and stir in the
  allspice, thyme, black pepper, vinegar, and soy sauce.
  
  * Coat the chicken with the sauce.  Cover and marinate in the
  refrigerator for 24 hours, turning once.
  
  * Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Place a meat thermometer in one
  of the thigh pieces.  Place a shallow pan of boiling water on the
  oven floor. Put the chicken on a rack and place in a roasting pan.
  Roast, basting frequently with the sauce, until three-quarters cooked
  (120 degrees on the meat thermometer), 30 to 45 minutes. Remove the
  chicken from the oven. Remove the meat thermometer
  
  * Preheat a broiler or grill
  
  * Baste the chicken with more jerk sauce.  Sear the chicken for 5
  minutes under a preheated broiler or over a very hot charcoal fire.
  Remove from the heat and let sit for 15 minutes before eating
  
  * Serves 6
  
  NOTE: Be sure to wear rubber gloves when handling these very hot
  peppers. If you don't you could irritate and burn your skin. Keep
  your gloves away from your face and eyes.

 Categories: Seafood, Main dish
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 md Lobster; or 1/2 large
      1    Shallot, sliced
      3    Morels, halved; regular
           -mushrooms will do)
           Butter
      1 oz Wine, white
      1 tb Bourbon; Cognac will do
      1 oz Heavy cream; or more
           -salt
 
  Very best lobster dish: Steam 1 big lobster per person over sea
  water. The really big ones (2+ lb.) aren't done as soon as they turn
  red - let them cook a couple more minutes beyond that; little
  lobsters are ready as soon as they turn red. Have an assistant remove
  the claw meat (keep whole) and whatever knuckle meat and roe (s)he
  can find while you take the tails and either (depending on their
  size) halve them lengthwise or cut them through the shell into
  slices. Heat a big knob of butter in a big saucepan and toss the tail
  pieces in the hot butter for a minute. Remove the tails to a hot
  platter. Dump the shallots and mushrooms in the same butter and toss
  for a minute; then remove them to the same platter. While the butter
  is still hot, add white wine and bourbon (Cognac will do); let cook
  down for 15 secs or so and then add cream, slowly and keeping the
  heat high. While your assistant arranges the tails on individual
  plates, with the claws and maybe some watercress or parsley as
  garnish, keep an eye on the sauce as it thickens. When the sauce is
  thick, add a little salt if you need it and dump in the onions,
  mushrooms, roe, and knuckle meat. Pour sauce over lobster tails and
  serve at once. Save the tomalley for: Tomalley croustades. Fry rounds
  from a baguette or other very thin loaf in butter until they just
  begin to turn golden. Drain on paper towels. When they are cool,
  spread them with lobster tomalley mixed with heavy cream to make a
  thick paste. You may grate a tiny bit of Gruyere or other Swiss-style
  cheese over each one. Put under the broiler for a few seconds until
  the tops bubble.

      Title: VERY HOT CAJUN SAUCE FOR BEEF
 Categories: Cajun, Sauces
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Chopped onions
    1/2 c  Chopped green peppers
    1/4 c  Chopped celery
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil
    1/4 c  + 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour
    3/4 ts Ground cayenne pepper
    1/2 ts White pepper
    1/2 ts Black pepper
      2    Bay leaves
    1/4 c  Minced jalapeno peppers(note
      1 ts Minced garlic
      3 c  Basic beef stock
 
  NOTE: Fresh jalapenos are preferred; if you have to use pickled ones,
  rinse as much vinegar from them as possible. Combine the onions, bell
  peppers and celery in a small bowl and set aside while you start the
  roux. (NOTE: Unlike the roux in most other recipes in this book, the
  roux we use here is light brown. Therefore, instead of heating the
  oil to the smoking stage, we heat it to only 250F; this prevents the
  roux from getting too brown.) In a heavy 2-quart saucepan heat the
  oil over medium-low heat to about 250F. With a metal whisk, whisk in
  the flour a little at a time until smooth. Continue cooking, whisking
  constantly, until roux is light brown, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Be
  carefyul not to let the roux scorch or splash on your skin.  Remove
  from heat and with a spoon immediately stir in the vegtable mixture
  and the red, white and black peppers; return pan to high heat and
  cook about 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add the bay leaves,
  jalapeno peppers and garlic, stirring well. Continue cooking about 2
  minutes, stirring constantly.  (We're cooking the seasonings and
  vegetables in the light roux and the mixture should, therefore, be
  pasty.) Remove from heat.
     In a separate 2-quart saucepan, bring the stock to a boil. Add the
  roux mixture by spoonfuls to the boiling stock, strirring until
  dissolved between each addition. Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce
  heat to a simmer and cook until the sauce reduces to 3-1/2 cups,
  about 15 minutes. Skim any oil from the top and serve immediately.

 Categories: Oriental
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1    Inch ginger -- fresh,
           Peeled
  4 1/2    Cloves garlic

      2 c  Yogurt -- thick
      6    Tomatoes, medium -- diced
      6    Cardamoms
      6    Cloves
      6    Cinnamon sticks
      1 ts Turmeric powder
      1 ts Garam masala
      2 ts Coriander powder
    1/2 ts Red chili powder
      1 bn Coriander leaves -- fresh,
           Chopped
      1 bn Mint leaves -- fresh,  torn
      5    Chillies, green -- slit
  2 1/2 c  Rice (basmati preferred) --
           Washed and well drai
      2    Medium-large onions --
           Sliced very  thin
      4 ts Ghee
      5 c  Water
      2 c  Beans -- slivered
      1 c  Carrots -- slivered
      2 c  Cauliflower -- cut into
        sm Flore
      4    Bay leaves (tez patta)
      1 ts (heaped) fennel seeds
      1    Star anise -- broken
 
  Pre-heat oven to 400.
  
  Grind to paste the ginger, garlic, and 4 chillies. Add to yogurt
  along with tomatoes, cardamoms, cloves, cinnamon, turmeric, garam
  masala, coriander powder, red chili, coriander leaves, mint and slit
  chillies. Mix well and set aside. For best results let this soak for
  2-3 hours.
  
  Fry half the sliced onions in 3 tbsp. ghee until translucent. Add the
  rice, stir till coated with ghee and fry until a little crisp. Add
  water, cover and cook on low, low heat till three-fourths done.
  Remove from heat. Removing rice off heat after it is three-quarters
  done should leave some fluid content that will get absorbed in the
  baking process. Baking allows the flavors to seep in evenly as well
  as make the rice fluffy.
  
  Heat 4 tbsp. oil plus 1 tbsp. ghee. Add tez patta, fennel, star anise
  (a must!). Add remaining sliced onion and fry until clear. Add
  vegetables, stir until crisp cooked. Add yogurt mix, salt to taste
  and cook it down till thick and spoonable.
  
  Spread some rice in a large aluminum baking pan, then spread on some
  of the yogurt mix. Repeat, alternating rice and yogurt mix till
  everything is used up. Cover tightly with foil wrap by crimping foil
  over edges of pan. Bake for 30 mins.
  
  Serve with a cold raita and a light curry of your choice.

      Title: VERY SIMPLE MUSHROOM SOUP
 Categories: Vegetarian, Digest, Soups
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea Text file
 
  Given that morel season is here, I thought I would post a recipe for
  wild mushroom soup. This might work with regular mushrooms but I've
  only made them with fresh wild ones. Boletes aka the Porcini to be
  exact. If you can get them, they make a simply sublime soup. This
  recipe is from Joe's Book of Mushroom Cookery.
  
  Clean mushrooms well. Barely cover with water in a saucepan. Turn the
  heat on and cover the pot with a tight fitting lid. When the water
  comes to a boil, turn it down to a simmer for 10 minutes. The
  mushrooms will have given off their liquid and literally made their
  own soup. For every 2 cups of liquid, add 1 tsp each of salt and
  sugar and 1 tbl soy sauce. Add 4-5 scallions, sliced thin and 1/3 cup
  shoestring potatoes. The soup is finished when the potatoes are
  cooked.

      Title: VERY SPICY DELICIOUS CHICKPEAS
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian, Indian
      Yield: 1 Recipe
 
      5 tb Vegetable oil
      2 md Onions; peeled and minced
      8    Garlic cloves
           -- peeled and minced
      1 tb Ground coriander seeds
      2 ts Ground cumin seeds
    1/4 ts Ground cayenne pepper
           - or more
      1 ts Ground turmeric
      6 tb Red-ripe tomatoes
           -- (finely chopped, skinned)
           -- fresh or canned
     40 oz Canned chickpeas; -OR-
  4 1/2 c  -Home-cooked chickpeas
      2 ts Ground roasted cumin seeds
      1 tb Ground amchoor (opt.); OR...
      1 sm -Lime (juice & pulp only)
      2 ts Kashmiri red pepper
      1 ts Garam masala
    1/2 ts Salt (or to taste)
      1 tb Lemon juice (or more)
      1    Fresh hot green chili
           -- minced
      2 ts Fresh ginger
           -- (very finely grated)
 
  This dish, a staple street food of the bazaars of Old Delhi, is
  wonderfully tart and hot.  It requires two similar spice blends, one
  added to the browned onions and garlic, the other toward the end of
  the cooking time. Amchoor (powdered green mango) lends a haunting
  sourness. If you can't find this ingredient, substitute the juice and
  pulp of a small lime (the dish is also delicious without either). You
  may use Hungarian paprika as a substitute for Kashmiri red pepper;
  either will give color but no heat.
  
  These spicy chickpeas can be made up to two days ahead of time. In
  fact, their flavor improves if they are left, refrigerated, for at
  least 24 hours.
  
  DIRECTIONS: =========== Heat the oil in a wide pot over a medium
  flame. When hot, put in the minced onions and garlic. Stir and fry
  until the mixture is a rich medium brown shade. Turn heat to medium
  low and add the coriander, cumin, (NOT the roasted cumin), cayenne,
  and turmeric. Stir for a few seconds.  Now put in the finely chopped
  tomatoes. Stir for a few seconds.  Now put in the finely chopped
  tomatoes. Stir and fry until the tomatoes are well amalgamated with
  the spice mixture and brown lightly. Add the drained chickpeas and 1
  cup water. Stir. Add the ground roasted cumin, amchoor, red pepper,
  garam masala, salt, and lemon juice. Stir again. Cover, turn heat to
  low, and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove cover and add the minced green
  chili and grated ginger. Stir and cook, uncovered, for another 30
  seconds.

MMMMM-------------------MUSHROOM-SPINACH LAYER------------------------
     10 oz Frozen chopped spinach
           - defrosted & squeezed dry
      1 tb Vegetable oil
      1 c  Frozen chopped onions
      8 oz Frozen sliced mushrooms
      2 tb Unsalted butter

    1/2 c  Dried bread crumbs
      1 ts Salt; or to taste
    1/8 ts Ground nutmeg
      1 pn Ground red pepper
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  MAKE THE CARROT-CAULIFLOWER LAYERS. Place the carrots and cauliflower
  in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel chopping blade.
  Process until smooth. In a large skillet, heat the oil over
  medium-high heat. Add the onions and saute them until tender and
  golden. This will take about 5 minutes. Stir in the butter and let it
  melt. Scrape the onions and butter into the processor. Add all the
  remaining ingredients for the carrot-cauliflower layers and process
  until smooth. Scrape into a bowl, cover, and refrigerate while
  preparing the other layer. Preheat your oven to 350F. Bring a large
  pot of water to a boil. Butter a 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pan. Line the
  bottom and ends with buttered wax paper, buttered side up. MAKE THE
  SPINACH-MUSHROOM LAYER. Place the spinach in the processor and pulse
  a few times. Cook the onions in hot oil for 1 minute. Add the frozen
  mushrooms and cook them along with the onions over high heat until
  all the liquid has evaporated, about 6 to 7 minutes. Stir in the
  butter. Scrape the mixture into the processor. Add all the remaining
  ingredients and process until smooth. Scrape about half of the
  carrot-cauliflower mixture into the pan, packing it well into the
  corners, and flattening it with a spatula or the palm of your hand to
  remove any air pockets. Add all of the spinach-mushroom mixture, and
  again flatten it. Finally, add the remaining carrot mixture. Smooth
  it down on top. Cover with buttered wax paper. Place pan in another
  pan and fill the latter with boiling water to a level of 2 inches up
  the side of the terrine. Bake in the preheated oven for 1 1/4 hours,
  or until a knife inserted into the middle comes out clean. Remove
  terrine from the oven and cover it with a piece of cardboard or a
  second loaf pan (the same size) right side up. Place about 1 pound of
  weight, evenly distributed, on the terrine. Refrigerate until well
  chilled, at least 2 hours. Once chilled, carefully remove from the
  pan by running a thin-bladed knife between the terrine and the pan.
  Invert onto a flat dish, peel off the paper and serve. Garnish with
  curly leafed lettuce, if desired.

      Title: VICKI'S NOGGIN-KNOCKIN' EGGNOG
 Categories: Drinks, Christmas, Alcohol
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Dark rum
    1/2 c  Brandy
    1/2 c  Bourbon
      6 lg Eggs, separated
      1 c  Sugar
      3 c  Milk, whole
  1 1/2 c  Heavy cream
           Nutmeg, grated
 
  Combine liquors.  Beat yolks until pale and lemon-colored (I do it in
  a food processor).  Add sugar a little at a time, beating till sugar
  is dissolved and mixture is thick.  Slowly pour mixture in a fine
  stream into the liquor, beating constantly. Beat in milk. (Food
  processor bowl won't hold it all.)
  
  Beat cream until stiff.  Beat egg whites until they are stiff; fold
  carefully into whipped cream.  Slowly fold in liquor until blended.
  Chill. Top with grated nutmeg.
  
  Vicki's notes:
  
  *  The cream *will* rise to the top.  Have to beat husband away with a
  stick to guard it, whereupon I whisk the cream back in before I serve
  seconds.  I know, I'll probably die of salmonella poisoning... but
  what a way to go!
  
  *  Will need 1 pint of cream, 1 pint of Meyer's dark rum, and 1/2
  pint each of Jim Beam bourbon and E&J brandy.

 Categories: Turkey, Holiday, Vicki
      Yield: 1 Turkey
 
           Turkey
           Butter, melted
           Kahlua
           Apricot preserves
 
  Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
  
  Rub cleaned turkey with unsalted shortening or butter. Cover the bird
  with a piece of cheesecloth soaked in melted, unsalted butter. Reduce
  the heat to 350 and place turkey in oven.
  
  Make glaze of equal parts Kahlua and apricot preserves. Sounds weird,
  but it is delicious.  Baste turkey with glaze right over the top of
  the cheesecloth.  (The taste actually permeates the meat.)
  
  Peel the cloth off before presentation (bird is a dark, rich brown)
  and serve w/ sauce.
  
  Vicki's notes:
  
  *  The basic technique is from "Joy of Cooking," although Rombauer
  says to put it on a rack.  The glaze is from the Kahlua company.
  
  *  The only time I used pop-up indicators is when I was given turkeys
  that had them.  I ignored the indicator --> used standard cooking
  chart for weight (should be on turkey). You know how the turkey keeps
  cooking even when it's not in the oven?  Sure enough, after he had
  been out of oven long enough to serve, the indicator FINALLY popped
  up!

  Saute onions in margarine for 20 minutes, add broths and water and let
  simmer another 20-30 minutes. Put one slice of bread in each bowl,
  sprinkle with 2-3 Tbs cheese. Ladle soup over the top. It melts the
  cheese, no broiler hassle and it tastes as good as any I have had
  out! (I must confess, we did use the butter, grin, but it probably
  would taste good with the margarine).

      Title: VIDALIA ONION TART
 Categories: Vegetables, Appetizers
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1    Filling
      2 lb Vidalia sweet onions
      2    Egg yolks
      6 tb Heavy cream
    1/2 c  Water
    1/4 lb Bacon - cut in strips
      1 ts Flour
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Peanut oil
      1    PIE PASTRY
      2 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Unsalted butter
      2    Egg yolks
      1 ts Salt
      6 tb Cold water
 
  FILLING: Slice onions thinly and layer in large saucepan. Add 1
  teaspoon of salt to them and set aside to draw out the water for at
  least 30 minutes. Add 1/4 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of water. Steam
  onions until transparent and water is cooked out. Meanwhile, place
  sliced bacon in a small amount of water in a shallow pan and blanch
  to remove excess fat. Bacon should be limp. Pour off liquid and
  coarsely chop. When water is cooked out of onions, add 1 teaspoon of
  flour and stir to dissolve.
  
  Remove from heat and add 2 egg yolks and cream with the onions. Stir
  constantly.
  
  PIE PASTRY: Sift flour onto a pastry board, cloth or dough bowl and
  make a large well in the center.  Pound butter to soften slightly or
  have at room temperature. Place butter, egg yolks, salt and smaller
  amount of water in the well and work together with the fingertips of
  one hand until partly mixed. Gradually work in flour, pulling dough
  into large crumbs using the fingertips of both hands. If the crumbs
  are dry, sprinkle over a tablespoon of more water. Press dough firmly
  together - it should be soft, but not sticky. Work on a lightly
  floured board, pushing dough away with the heel of the hand and
  gathering it up with a dough scraper until smooth and pliable.  Press
  dough into a ball. Wrap in foil or plastic wrap and chill for 30
  minutes.
  
  It can be stored tightly wrapped in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
  
  DIRECTIONS: Roll pastry to about 1/2 inch thickness in a rectangular
  shape. Place pastry on an oiled baking sheet. Crimp edges of pastry
  if desired. Beat an egg yolk with a pinch of salt and brush over the
  entire pastry. This is called "egg glazing" and helps the filling
  adhere to the pastry. Pierce pastry with a fork in several places to
  prevent bubbles from forming while baking.
  
  Spread onion mixture over the pastry and sprinkle the chopped bacon
  on top. Bake at 300 degrees F. for 10 to 15 minutes or until nicely
  borwned. Cut into 1 inch squares for hors d'oeuvres. May be made a
  day ahead and reheated. Wait to cut until after heating if made
  ahead. May be baked in individual tartlet pans or a pie plate.

      Title: VIENESSE JAM CAKES
 Categories: Cookies
      Yield: 24 Servings
 
           From: Gaye Levy DTXT63A
    3/4 c  Unsalted butter;well chilled
           -cut into 12 pieces
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 tb Sour cream
      1 ts Vanilla
    1/4 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Flour
    1/4 c  Raspberry preserves
      2 tb Powdered sugar
 
  Using the steel blade of your Food Processor, chop butter with 1/4 cup
  sugar until butter is the size of small peas, using 4 or 5 on/off
  turns. Add sour cream, vanilla and salt and blend just until
  combined, using about 10 on/off turns.  Sprinkle flour over and blend
  just until granular crumbs form, about 15 seconds.
  
  Press 1 generous tablespoon of crumb mixture into each of 24 miniature
  muffin cups (1 3/4 diameter top). Bake at 350~ until edges of each
  cake are just golden, about 22 minutes.
  
  Immediately make 3/8-inch deep indentation in center of each using
  end of a wooden spoon. Fill each with about 1/2 tsp preserves. Let
  cool in pan 10 minutes. Transfer to racks and cool completely. Just
  before serving, sprinkle sift powdered sugar over top of each.
  
  Notes from Gaye: Warning! these are addictive and a threat to your
  hips. They are THAT good. These will keep in an airtight container
  for 2 days or frozen for future use. Substitute any type of jam or
  preserves. These taste good even when you use margarine or shortening
  instead of butter (which I refuse to use for health reasons).

      Title: VIENNA CHRISTMAS STOLLEN
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Milk;scald/cool to lukewarm
  3 1/2    Yeast;dry/envelopes
    3/4 c  Water; lukewarm
      3 c  Flour; sifted
    1/2 c  Eggs; yolks/lightly beaten
    3/4 c  Sugar
      2 ts Salt
      1 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Butter; softened
           Flour; 10-11 c. as needed
      5 c  Sultanas; (currants)
  1 1/2 c  Almonds;chopped or slivered
      1 c  Citron; chopped
    1/2    Lemon; rind only/grated
      2 ts Rum
 
  Milk should be cooled to about 100 degrees. Dissolve the yeast in the
  lukewarm water and add 1/4 c. of the cooled milk and 3 c. sifted
  flour. Cover the sponge with a cloth and let it ripen until bubbles
  appear on the surface and it is about to drop in the center. Pour the
  remaining milk over the sponge. Add the egg yolks, sugar and salt and
  beat until the ingredients are well blended. Add 1 cup flour and beat
  well. Blend in the butter. Add more flour gradually to make a smooth
  dough, or until 10 to 11 cups have been added. Some flours absorb
  more liquid than others. Knead in the sultanas, almonds, and citron,
  along with the lemon rind which should be mixed with the rum. Knead
  the dough until the fruits and nuts are dispersed well through it and
  it is smooth. Dust the top lightly with flour and let it rise in a
  warm place about 45 minutes. Punch it down and let stand for 20
  minutes. Divide the dough in half and knead the pieces until smooth.
  Let them stand for 10 minutes longer. Place one ball of dough on a
  lightly floured board, and with a rolling pin, press down the center
  of the ball, and roll the pin to and fro 4 to 5 times, pressing all
  the time to make an elliptical shape 6 inches long and 3 1/2" wide.
  The center rolled part should be 1/8" thick and 4 inches long. Both
  ends should remain untouched, resembling rather thick lips. Place
  this rolled out piece of dough on a buttered baking sheet and brush
  the center part with melted butter. Fold one lip toward the other and
  on the top of it. Press the fingertips down near and below the lips,
  pulling somewhat apart. Give a pull away from each end, pointing them
  toward the lips. The shape should resemble a waning moon. Repeat the
  process with the second piece of dough. (Unless you have gone
  completely crazy by now! note: my comment, not Gourmet's). Let the
  Stollen rise, covered in a warm place until they double in bulk,
  about 1 1/2 hours. Bake them in a moderately hot oven (375 degrees)
  for 35 to 40 minutes. Do not overbake them. Cool them on racks. Brush
  them with butter and cover with vanilla sugar. Recipe will be posted

      Title: VIENNESE BAKED APPLES
 Categories: Desserts, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      6 lg Apples
    1/2 c  Seedless raspberry jam
           Grated rind of 1/2 an orange
    1/2 c  Finely chopped walnuts or
           -almonds
      3 tb Sugar
 
  An old Egyptian dream book states that "to dream of looking at apples
  betokens a wedding.  To dream of eating apples is a sign of mourning
  unless they are very sweet, then it is a sign of a great deal of
  prosperity in the marriage state".  Apples have travelled from the
  Old World to the New, but for some reason, we haven't created as many
  interesting desserts with them as the Europeans.  We seem to limit
  ourselves to pies, crunchy puddings, applesauce and jelly. This is
  one new way to try apples.
  
  When possible, use the large Rome Beauty apples
  
  Core apples and peel skin about 1/3 of the way down from the stem end.
  Pierce the rest of the skin all over with a fork to lessen wrinkling
  and splitting. Place apples in a large, deep pan that has a good
  cover and add water to a depth of 1/4 inch.  Mix jam with orange rind
  and nuts,fill the centre of each apple, then sprinkle sugar over top.
  Bring water in pan to a boil, then cover, lower heat and simmer 20-30
  minutes,depending on size of apples.  Baste 2-3 times with pan

     20    Cloves garlic
      2    Jalapeno peppers  --
           Chopped
      1    Chipotle pepper  --
           Crumbled
      2    Ribs celery
      1 md Yellow onion
      8 tb Nuoc mam
      5 tb Apple cider vinegar
      4 tb Worcestershire sauce
      2 tb Sugar
      2 tb Black pepper
      1 tb Brown mustard seeds  --
           Crushed
      1 tb Paprika
      1 tb Ground hot red pepper
           -preferably dried tab
      1 tb Whole cumin seed
      1 ts Oregano  -- crushed
 
  Here's a salsa recipe I've been playing around with for about a month
  or so. Originally, I wanted to "wrap" a salsa around a core of nuoc
  cham, with a hint of a Cajun hot sauce thrown in for good measure.
  The end result was a bit of a hybrid, but it seems to have worked out
  fairly well. Anyway, enjoy--it's a hot one!
  
  Peel (if necessary) and coarsely chop the tomatoes. Place in a
  saucepan. Add coarsely chopped onion, celery, and jalapenos. Peel and
  finely dice the garlic, add half now and reserve the other half.
  
  Grind the cumin seed and add it along with the nuoc mam, vinegar,
  worcestershire, paprika, ground red pepper, and three tablespoons of
  sugar. Bring to a gentle boil, reduce to a moderate simmer, and cook
  for 25-30 minutes, or until desired thickness is achieved.
  
  Now, about 5 minutes before the salsa is done, fry the reserved
  garlic in a little oil until it is crispy and golden. Remove the
  salsa from heat, add the fried garlic with one tablespoon of sugar,
  and stir occasionally until the salsa cools (stops steaming).
  
  This should keep for between 1 and 2 weeks at 40 degrees F. The recipe
  makes between 1.5 and 2 quarts of salsa.

      2 ts Sugar
    1/2 c  Chicken stock; fresh / can'd
    1/4 ts Black pepper; freshly ground
      1 ts Salt

MMMMM--------------------------GARNISH-------------------------------
    1/2 c  Dry-roasted peanuts; chopped
      2 tb Nuoc Mam  **
           Coriander leaves; chopped
 
     Hack the chicken into small serving pieces, chopping through the
  bones with a very sharp cleaver.
     Remove the outer leaves of the lemongrass and finely slice the
  tender white part at the base of the stalks. Bruise with a mortar and
  pestle or the handle of a cleaver.
     Finely slice the scallions, including the green tops.
     Mix the chicken with the salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, the lemongrass
  and scallions and set aside for 30 minutes.
     Heat a wok and add the oil, and when the oil is hot add the chicken
  mixture and stir-fry for 3 minutes.
     Add chile peppers and stir-fry on medium heat for 10 minutes or
  until chicken no longer looks pink.
     Season with sugar and pepper and add the chicken stock. Stir for a
  few minutes.
     Garnish with the peanuts, "nuoc mam" and coriander.
   Serve with rice, if desired.
     This quickly prepared but terrifically flavorful dish is great
  served with rice paper wrappers.  I love it with a few leaves of mint
  and basil. This is one you must try. It is easily done in a wok. By

  condiments on a separate plate. Add the amount and type of condiments
  that you prefer and enjoy! NOTE: have tissues handy - this will ream
  your sinuses out! Very healthy for people with allergies and/or upper
  respiratory problems. NOTE2: when slicing Anaheim chili (as with all
  fresh chilis), wear protective gloves and be careful not to touch
  unprotected skin with your gloved. The oils present in fresh chilis
  can burn and irritate your skin, particularly mucous membranes in the
  nose and/or eyes. NOTE3: this make a fabulous meal when paired with
  salad rolls. A recipe follows: Vietnamese Salad Rolls Salad Roll
  Wrappers (must be purchased in Asian markets or specialty stores.
  They are packaged about 100 to the package, but don't worry - they
  last forever if protected from moisture.) Rice Noodles Bean Sprouts
  fresh Cilantro and/or mint (an ageless controversy -which is best?
  you decide) green onions, julienned carrots, julienned celery,
  julienned *red pepper, julienned (optional) *Anaheim chili, julienned
  (optional) cooked meat, julienned (can include Chinese style roast
  pork, leftover cooked chicken, bay shrimp, cooked pork loin, or any
  combination thereof) Purchased Peanut Sauce (Taste of Thai makes a
  good one, but it has to be mixed with Coconut Milk, which drives up
  the calories. Look for a mix that can be mixed with water, add a
  little chili paste or "Dave's Insane Sauce" for piquancy, and use for
  a dipping sauce for the Salad Rolls Take a dinner plant and put hot
  tap water on it. Take a Wrapper and wet it, making sure that every
  part gets wet. Transfer to another clean plate and place filling
  items on top. Wrap it like a burrito, closed at both ends: flip one
  end over the filling. Fold in the perpendicular ends to close in the
  filling. Roll in direction of first fold until you reach the end of
  the wrapper. The gluten in the wrapper will self-seal it. Set aside
  and repeat until your filling ingredients are gone, or you've reached
  the limit of what can be eaten at that meal. These do not keep well -
  don't try to refrigerate or freeze them - it's a disaster. Salad
  Rolls make a great meal with a pot of Hot and Sour soup as an
  accompaniment, or a big bowl of Pho (Noodle Soup) and some peanut
  sauce.

      Title: VIETNAMESE CHILI SAUCE
 Categories: Vietnamese, Condiment
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2    Dried Red Chiles
      2    Cloves Garlic
    1/2 ts Sugar
      2 tb Nam Pla (Fish Sauce)
      1 tb Vinegar
      1 tb Lemon Juice
 
  Mince the chiles and garlic finely and place in a mortar. Mash with
  the heal of a cleaver or pestle. Add sugar and stir until it
  dissolves. Add fish sauce, vinegar and lemon juice, stirring between
  each addition. This makes enough for 2-4 people. It is wise to make
  double just to make sure there is enough. It can be frozen and will
  last for a few days in the refrigerator but will lose its kick in a
  short time. This is a basic chili sauce used for a dip with chicken
  or whatever. Variations of this are found in cambodia, Thailand and
  other Southeast Asian countries. You can fiddle with it endlessly.
  This is a good starting point. The proportions shown here produce
  what might be considered a mildly warm dip. Add more chiles for a
  higher degree of "HOT". Variations: Use green Serrano chiles instead
  of dried red ones, lime juice instead of lemon juice or palm sugar
  instead of granulated. If you make it in a food processor, don't over
  process. There should be small chunks of the ingredients in the
  sauce. The taste is sour and hot, very puckery. It's great with
  poached or steamed chicken, duck or game hens. Much better with bland
  dishes rather than something like curry, which has it's own blend of
  spices. Fish Sauce or Nam Pla in Thailand is a liquid made with
  anchovies and salt. It's not really fishy tasting. Look for it in the
  oriental section of the supermarket or at markets catering to Asian
  customers. Tiparos is a good brand made in the Phillipines. Thai or
  Vietnamese fish sauce are prefered, but may be more difficult to
  find. Chinese Fish Sauce is not suitable. If you want the flavor and
  not the incendiary quality, seed the chiles before adding them.

      2    Cloves garlic
    1/2 ts Sugar
      2 tb Fish sauce
      1 tb Vinegar
      1 tb Lemon juice
 
  Mince chilies and garlic finely and place in a mortar. Mash with the
  heel of a cleaver or pestle.  Add sugar and stir until it dissolves.
  Add fish sauce, vinegar and lemon juice, stirring between each
  addition. This makes enough for 2 to 4 people.  I almost always
  double the recipe just to make sure there's enough. I've kept it for
  long periods of time but unless you freeze it, it's past it's prime
  after a few days. This is a basic chili sauce used for a dip for
  chicken or whatever.
  
  Variations of this are found in Cambodia, Thailand and other Southeast
  Asian countries.  You can fiddle with it endlessly. This is a good
  starting point.  The proportions shown here produce what I consider a
  mildly warm dip.  I generally use two to six times as many chilies,
  depending on their strength and how hot I want it.
  
  Variations:  use green serrano chilies instead of dried red ones, lime
  juice instead of the lemon juice or palm sugar instead of granulated.
  If you make it in a food processor, don't over process. It should
  have small chunks of each ingredient rather than being a homogeneous
  liquid.
  
  The taste is sour and hot, very puckery.  It's great with poached or
  steamed chicken, duck or game hens. Much better with basically bland
  dishes rather than something like curry which has it's own blend of
  spices. Good with Chinese white-cut chicken or Steamed Ginger Chicken
  with Black Bean sauce.  It's truly addictive and I often serve it
  with meals that are not Oriental in origin.  Should be good with a
  firm- fleshed white fish or boiled shrimp or crab.
  
  Fish sauce is a liquid made with anchovies and salt. It's not really
  fishy tasting.  Look for it in the oriental section of supermarkets
  or at markets catering to Asian clientele.  Tiparos is a good brand
  made in the Philippines.  I prefer Thai or Vietnamese fish sauce, but
  they'll probably be harder to find. Chinese fish sauce is NOT a
  substitute.

           Stephen Ceideburg
      2 tb Sweetened Condensed Milk
      6 oz Strong Black Coffee
 
  In restaurants and cafe, dark-roast coffee is brewed in an individual
  drip pot that sits on top of a glass, slowly dripping into sweet
  milk. it takes a good 10 to 15 minutes for the water to finish
  dripping through, and the coffee is sipped at an equally leisurely
  pace. Both the coffee and the pots are available in Southeast Asian
  markets, but any type of coffee and any brew- method that produces a
  strong, rich-tasting cup will do.
  
  Place the milk in the bottom of an 8 ounce glass. Carefully pour in
  coffee, trying not to disturb the layer of milk. Stir milk up from
  bottom and sip coffee. There will probably be some milk left in the
  bottom of the glass when you are finished.
  
  Makes 1 serving.
  
  Variation: This coffee may also be served iced. Add ice cubes on top
  of the sweet milk and proceed as above.

      1 c  Grated carrot
      1 c  Bean sprouts; tails removed
      4    Shallots; minced -=OR=-
      1 sm -Onion
      2 c  Warm water
    1/4 c  Sugar
     16    12" rice paper wrappers
           - (dried)
           Peanut oil for deep-frying
           Lettuce leaves
           Fresh mint
           Fresh coriander leaves
 
  IN SEPARATE MEDIUM BOWLS, soak the mung bean noodles and tree-ear
  mushrooms with water until soft and pliable. Drain the noodles and
  cut into shorter lengths; set aside. Remove the hard centers from the
  mushrooms, coarsely chop and set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the
  pork, garlic, fish sauce and ground pepper. Mix in crab meat,
  tree-ear mushrooms, carrots, bean sprouts, shallots and bean thread
  noodles; set aside. Combine the warm water and sugar in a bowl. Lay 1
  rice paper wrapper on a damp towel. (Keep unused wrappers in their
  package.) Generously brush it with the sugar water; allow it to
  soften to a very pliable wrapper, about 30 seconds or sometime longer
  (depending upon the brand). With your hands shape 3 tablespoons
  filling into a tight compact 1-inch-wide-by-4-to-5-inch-long
  cylinder. Place cylinder along the lower edge of wrapper. Roll the
  bottom up and over the roll tightly. Fold both outside edges inward
  to enclose the ends. Continue rolling up into a cylinder; set aside
  covered with plastic wrap. Repeat until all the rolls are done. To
  cook and brown evenly, the roll must be firm and evenly packed. If
  the wrapper has a tear, bandage it with a softened rice-paper
  remnant. In a preheated wok or saucepan, add oil to a depth of 2
  inches and heat to 325F. Add a few rolls at a time, but do not crowd.
  Fry for 10 seconds. Immediately increase to high heat or 375F. Fry,
  turning occasionally until golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. Remove
  and drain on paper towel. Cut crosswise into 1+1/2-inch pieces.
  Arrange rolls on a plate lined with lettuce. On another plate,
  arrange leaves of lettuce, fresh coriander and mint leaves. To eat,
  wrap spring-roll garnish with sprig of coriander and mint leaves in a
  lettuce leaf and dip into nuoc cham sauce (See RECIPE).

      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      1    Stalk fresh lemon grass or
      1 tb Dried
  3 1/2 ts Curry powder
           Fresh ground black pepper
      1 ts Sugar
      4 ts Salt
      3 lb Chicken, cut up
      7 tb Vegetable oil
      3    Sweet potatoes or
      3    White potatoes, peeled and
           -cubed
      4    Cloves garlic, chopped
      3    Bay leaves
      1 lg Onion, cut into wedges,
           -separated
      2 c  Water
      1    Carrot, 2-inch slices
      2 c  Coconut milk
      1 c  Milk or water *
 
  * If you use canned coconut milk, you must use water.
  
  This is a real Vietnamese curry. Although adapted from the Indian,
  which is always made with white potatoes, the Vietnamese version has
  the option of using white or sweet potatoes, the latter being greatly
  favored by the Vietnamese. The Indian in- fluence is greatest in the
  South, where curried dishes are more popular than elsewhere in
  Vietnam.
  
  This is usually served with noodles as a party dish. When it is part
  of a family meal, it is eaten with rice. Bach serves this to her
  children for breakfast, when it is served with French bread--another
  influence on the cuisine of Vietnam.
  
  If you are using fresh lemon grass, simply remove the outer leaves and
  upper two-thirds of the stalks, then cut the remainder into 2-inch
  lengths. If you are, using, it must be soaked in warm water for 2
  hours, then drained and chopped fine.
  
  Combine the curry powder, black pepper, sugar, add salt and marinate
  the chicken in the mixture for at least 1 hour. Heat the oil and fry
  the potatoes over high heat until brown. (It is not necessary to
  completely cook potatoes at this point, only to brown them.) When
  well browned, remove from the pan and set aside until ready to cook
  the curry. Pour off most of the oil from the pan, leaving 2
  tablespoons for cooking the chicken.
  
  Heat 2 tablespoons oil over a high flame. Fry the garlic for a few
  seconds, then add the bay leaves, onion, and lemon grass; stir
  briefly and add the marinated chicken, stirring long enough to sear
  the meat slightly. Add the 2 cups of water and carrot, then cover and
  bring to a boil. Turn the heat down and simmer for 5 minutes; uncover
  and stir, then cook, covered, for another 10 minutes. Remove the
  cover and add the prefried potatoes, the coconut milk, and the milk.
  Cover again and simmer another 15 minutes. Serve with rice, Rice
  Sticks, or Japanese Alimentary Paste Noodles.

      Title: VIETNAMESE DIPPING SAUCE
 Categories: Vietnamese, Condiments, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Minced fresh pineapple
      3 tb Mam nem (anchovy sauce)
      2    Garlic cloves, crushed
      1    Fresh red chili pepper,
           -seeded
      1 tb Sugar
      3 tb Fresh lemon juice
  1 1/2 ts Rice vinegar or distilled
           -white vinegar
      3 tb Nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish
           -sauce)
 
  For anchovy lovers, here are a couple of variations for a Vietnamese
  dipping sauce made with 'em.  This is traditionally served with Beef
  Fondue with Vinegar (Bo Nhung Giam) that is part of the Vietnamese
  feast called Bo Bay Mon (Beef in seven ways++seven distinct ways of
  preparing beef). It's good with other stuff too but can be a bit
  strong to Western tastes. Some restaurants have it but you might have
  to ask for it. This is by far the most intricate of sauces in the
  Vietnamese culinary repertoire. What makes it so special is the use
  of a condiment called mam nem, prepared from ground fresh anchovies
  and salt and fermented over a period of time. It can become
  dangerously addictive. Traditionally, mam nem is served as a dipping
  sauce for barbecued or fried fish. In general it goes well with
  grilled foods.  It is an essential sauce fro Beef Fondue with Vinegar.
  
  Use only fresh pineapple and remember to shake the bottle of anchovy
  sauce thoroughly before using. Anchovy cream may be substituted.
  
  Over a bowl, squeeze the pineapple between your hands to extract as
  much juice as possible.  Combine the pulp and juice and set aside.
  Into a bowl, strain the anchovy sauce through a very fine sieve,
  pressing on th solids with a spoon to extract all of the liquid.
  Discard the solids.
  
  Pound or crush the garlic, chile and sugar to a fine paste in a bowl.
  Stir in the pineapple mixture, strained anchovy sauce, lemon juice,
  vinegar an fish sauce. Stir to blend.
  
  Yield: 1 1/3 cups
  
  VARIATION: If you are unable to find mam nem sauce, here is a
  variation of the above recipe, using canned anchovies. Add pineapple,
  if desired. 2 garlic cloves, crushed 1 fresh red chili pepper, seeded
  2 tablespoons sugar 2 cans (2 ounces each) flat anchovies, drained
  1/4 cup nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish sauce) 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice 2
  tablespoons pineapple or water
  
  Combine the garlic, chile and sugar in a mortar and pestle and pound
  to a fine paste.  Add the anchovies and mash to a very smooth paste.
  Stir in the fish sauce, lemon juice and pineapple juice. Mix well.
  
  Yield: about 1 cup.

  30 minutes; reduce temperature as the water disappears in the pot,
  and check for doneness. Fry eggs and scallion at 300 degrees in a
  frying pan; pour one layer at a time in the pan.  After each is done,
  roll each one up like a jellyroll, slicing across them thinly, and
  reserve for the topping. Heat 2 T salad oil over 300 degree stove,
  and saut# the onion and garlic until the onion is clear. Stir in the
  cooked rice, stirring continuously, and add the soy sauce and sugar.
  Mix well for about 10 minutes. Top with green onion and eggs. May
  also add diced cooked chicken, thin sliced boiled pork shoulder, or
  sliced ham. Submitted By SAM WARING

 Categories: Chicken, Salads
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    1/3 lb Rice vermicelli or somen
           -noodles
      1    Dried red chile pepper,
           -coarsely chopped, OR
    1/4 ts Red-pepper flakes
      1 tb Sugar
      1 tb Fresh lime juice
      5 tb Rice-wine vinegar
      2 tb Fish sauce
      2 lg Carrots
      1 lg Cucumber, peeled if waxy
    1/2    Head Chinese cabbage, leaves
           -separated & coarsely
           -chopped (about 4 C)
    1/2    Head Boston lettuce,
           -coarsely chopped
           -(about 2 C)
    1/2 c  Bean sprouts
      2    Whole boneless and skinless
           -chicken breasts (4 halves)
      2 ts Canola or vegetable oil
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
    1/2 c  Fresh mint leaves
    1/2 c  Cilantro leaves
    1/4 c  Lightly salted roasted
           -peanuts, coarsely chopped
 
  1. Soak vermicelli, if using, in a bowl of cold water for 15 minutes.
  Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine chopped chile pepper or red-pepper
  flakes, sugar, lime juice, 2 T of the vinegar, and fish sauce. Stir
  well to dissolve sugar. Set aside.
  
  2. Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Drain vermicelli
  and add to boiling water; cook for 2 minutes. If using somen, add dry
  noodles to boiling water and cook for 3 minutes. Drain noodles and
  transfer to a bowl of cold water. Set aside.
  
  3. Peel carrots and, using a sharp zester, cut into long, thin
  threads. Use a vegetable peeler to "peel" entire cucumber into long,
  thin strips. Cut strips lengthwise into thinner strips, about 1/4
  inch wide.
  
  4. Combine carrots, cucumber, cabbage, lettuce, and bean sprouts in a
  mixing bowl and toss with remaining vinegar. Set aside.
  
  5. Remove tenderloin (meat attached to underside of breast) from
  chicken breasts; save for another use. Place breasts between 2 pieces
  of plastic wrap. Using the flat side of a meat tenderizer or cleaver,
  pound breasts
      1/4    inch thick.
  
  6. Heat grill or grill pan and brush with oil. Season chickcn on both
  sides with salt and pepper, and grill until cooked through and juices
  run clear, about 4 minutes per side. Remove from grill and allow to
  sit for 1 to 2 minutes.
  
  7. Drain noodles well. Divide salad mixture among 4 plates. Top each
  with a quarter of the noodles. Slice chicken breasts lengthwise into
  1/2-inch-thick strips and place on salads. Set out fish-sauce
  mixture, mint and cilantro leaves, and chopped peanuts in separate
  bowls, for dressing and garnishing individual salads.

    1/2 tb Sugar
      4 tb Fresh lime juice
      3 tb Fish sauce
      1    Fresh or dried red chile
           -seeded, finely minced
      3 tb Water
      1 tb Finely grated carrot
 
  Here's scanned recipe number two++another recipe for a perennial
  favorite, Cha gio or Vietnamese Spring Rolls. I haven't tried this
  one yet, but it's from Joyce Jue, the SF Chron columnist and her
  stuff is usually bang-on.
  
  In 2 separate bowls, soak the tree ears and the bean thread noodles
  in warm water until soft and pliable, about 6 minutes. Rinse tree
  ears and drain. Remove and discard any hard centers. Coarsely chop
  and set aside, Drain the noodles and roughly chop into about 2-inch
  lengths; set aside.
  
  Mix together the pork, garlic, shallots, fish sauce and pepper. Add
  tree ears, noodles, carrots and bean sprouts; mix together with your
  hands.
  
  Nuoc Cham Dipping Sauce:  Combine garlic, sugar, lime juice, fish
  sauce, chile and water; let sit at room temperature for at least 10
  minutes, When ready to use, strain into a small bowl and add grated
  carrot. Makes 1/2 cup.
  
  To form spring rolls:  Combine warm water and sugar in a wide shallow
  pan (such as a cake pan).  Immerse 1 wrapper in the sugar water for a
  second and immediate immediately place it flat on the counter or on a
  wet, wrung-out, kitchen towel.  Let sit until it wrinkles and softens
  to a pliable skin, about 1 minute, sometimes longer.
  
  Using your hands, shape 3 tablespoons of filling into a tight compact
  log, about 1-inch in diameter and 4 to 5 inches long. Place the log
  along the bottom third of the wrapper. Roll the bottom edge over the
  log, then roll it over the filling once more.  Make sure the wrapper
  is taut around the filling.  Fold the outside wrapper edges inward to
  enclose the ends. Roll up to seal.  If there is a tear in the
  wrapper, bandage it with a soften softened rice paper remnant.
  
  Set rolls seam side down on a lightly oiled baking sheet and cover
  with a damp towel.  Continue making the remaining rolls.
  
  To deep fry rolls:  Pour 2 inch inches of oil into a wok or deep-fat
  fry fryer.  Heat to 325F.  Add a few rolls at a time. Do not crowd.
  Fry for 10 seconds. Immediately increase heat to high (375F).
  Continue to fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 6 to
  8 minutes.
  
  Remove rolls to paper towels to drain.
  
  Serving suggestions:
  
  Cut fried rolls crosswise into 1 1/2-inch pieces . Dip into sauce and
  enjoy as an appetizer.  Or, wrap rolls lettuce leaves with sprigs of
  coriander and mint. Dip into sauce and eat as a light lunch or part
  of a multi course meal.
  
  NOTE:  If you're working ahead, place the rolls (unfried) on a tray
  with a sheet of plastic wrap be between each layer, and refrigerate
  them overnight, wrapped in plastic. Don't keep them longer than 1
  day. Fried, cooled rolls may be sealed in airtight freezer bags and
  frozen for up to 2 months.  To reheat, thaw, place on a baking sheet
  and bake at 350F for 10 minutes.
  
  Makes 16 rolls.

  Soak bone overnight in cold water.  Place bones, oxtails and flank
  steak in a large stock pot.  Add water to cover and bring to a boil.
  Cook 10 minutes, drain and rinse pot and bones. Return bones to pot,
  add 6 quarts water and bring to a boil.  Skim surface of scum and
  fat. Stir bones at bottom from time to time. Add 3 more quarts water,
  bring to a boil again and skim scum.  Lower heat and let simmer.
  Char clove-studded onions, shallots, and ginger under a broiler until
  they release their fragrant odors.  Tie charred vegetables, star
  anise, and cinnamon stick in a thick, dampened cheesecloth.  Put it
  in stock with parsnips and salt. Simmer for 1 hour. Remove flank
  steak and continue simmering broth, uncovered pot, for 4-5 hours.

  fish sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer. In another
  pot, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil.  Add noodles and drain
  immediately. Do not overcook noodles. Divide among 4 large soup
  bowls. Top noodles with sliced meats. Bring broth to a rolling boil,
  then ladle into soup bowls. Garnish with scallions mixture and black
  pepper. Serve the onions in hot chili sauce and remaining ingredients
  on the side to add as desired. Also, you can add Hoisin sauce as a
  dip. Serves 4.

      2    Green onions, chopped
      2 ts Soy sauce

    1/2 c  Or so roasted peanuts,
           -coarsely ground
           Handful cilantro, coarsely
           -chopped
 
  This is typical of what is becoming known here as East/West cuisine,
  the flavors and ingredients of Asia presented in a Western form. All
  these are from an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, 7/15/92.
  Each bite of these burgers packs a zesty wallop of flavor and
  texture. Good accompaniments are bland steamed rice or French bread,
  each of which balances these assertive flavors.
  
  Mix meat with garlic, onions, soy sauce, peanut oil, sugar and
  Tabasco or cayenne.  Form into patties and grill until cooked
  through. Serve each grilled patty spread with hoisin sauce, wrapped
  in a leaf of lettuce, sprinkled with peanuts and cilantro.

  I'd go.

      Title: VIETNAMESE SPRING ROLLS #1
 Categories: Vietnam, Appetizers
      Yield: 80 Servings
 
      2 oz Bean-thread (cellophane) noo
           -dles  1 lb. ground por
      1 lg Onion; chopped fine
      2 tb Tree ears (see cook's notes)
      3    Garlic cloves; chopped fine
      3    Scallions; chopped fine
      7 oz Crab meat; cartilage removed
           -and meat flaked
    1/2 ts Pepper, black, ground
     20    Sheets dried rice paper
      4    Eggs; well beaten
      2 c  Oil, peanut
           Lettuce; shredded
           Mint leaves
           Cilantro
           Cucumber; sliced
           Nuoc cham dipping sauce
 
   Cook's notes: Tree ears, also called cloud ears, are dried fungi
  that look like dried black chips. When soaked in water they expand 5
  or 6 times their orginal size. Soak in warm water for 30 minutes;
  drain and finely chop.
   Procedure: Soak noodles in warm water for 20 minutes; drain and cut
  into 1" lengths. Combine noodles with remaining filling ingredients
  in a bowl and set aside. Cut a round rice-paper sheet into quarters.
  Place cut paper on a flat surface. With a pastry brush, paint beaten
  eggs over the entire surface of each of the pieces. Before filling,
  wait for the egg mixture to soften the wrappers; this takes about two
  minutes. When the wrapper looks soft and transparent, place about 1
  tsp. of filling near the curved side, in the shape of a rectangle.
  Fold the sides over to enclose filling and continue to roll.
   After filling all the wrappers, pour the oil into a large, deep
  frying pan or wok, put the rolls into the cold oil, turn the heat to
  moderate and fry 20 to 30 minutes until golden brown.
   Presentation: Serve  hot. Serve spring rolls  on vegetable platterss
  among lettuce, mint leaves, cilantro and cucumber slices. Also serve
  with nuoc cham sauce if desired. Makes 80 spring rolls. Source:

           Basic Vegetable Platter
           Carrot Salad
           Double recipe of Nuoc Cham
 
  Here they are!  The incomparable "Cha Gio" or Vietnamese spring rolls.
  
  Yields 80 spring rolls.
  
  Combine the filling ingredients in a bowl and set aside.
  
  Cut a round rice paper sheet into quarters.  Place the cut rice paper
  on a flat surface.  With a pastry brush, paint the beaten egg over
  the entire surface of each of the pieces. Before filling, wait for
  the egg mixture to take effect, softening the wrappers; this takes
  about 2 minutes. When you become adept at this, you can work on
  several wrappers at a time.
  
  When the wrapper looks soft and transparent, place about 1 teaspoon of
  filling near the curved side, in the shape of a rectangle. Fold the
  sides over to enclose the filling and continue to roll.
  
  After filling all the wrappers, pour the oil into a large frying pan,
  put the spring rolls into the cold oil, turn the heat to moderate,
  and fry for 20 to 30 minutes, until a lovely golden brown. (This is
  Bach's special method of keeping spring rolls crisp).
  
  To serve the spring rolls, proceed as follows:
  
  Arrange the ingredients for the vegetable platter (lettuce, mint
  leaves, coriander, and the cucumber slices) according to the
  directions preceding. Have ready the carrot salad and a bowl of nuoc
  cham. Each person has a bowl into which he places a bit of lettuce, 2
  or 3 mint leaves, some coriander, and 2 cucumber slices. Each person
  then adds 1 or 2 spring rolls to his bowl, sprinkles with the nuoc
  cham, and eats the spring rolls and vegetables together, using
  chopsticks or a fork.
  
  Additional carrot salad may be added to taste.
  
  Another very popular serving method calls for placing the vegetables
  on a lettuce leaf, adding the spring roll, and rolling it into a
  cylinder. Holding the cylinder with his fingers, each diner then dips
  it into his own small bowl of nuoc cham.
  
  NOTE:  We have found that frying the spring rolls in peanut oil keeps
  them crisper than frying in any other oil.

  *  Beet should be washed and dried.
  
  If you are using a fresh beet, preheat the oven to 375 Degrees F.
  Wrap the beet in aluminum foil and bake until tender, about 1 1/4
  hours. When the beet is cool enough to handle, peel it and cut into
  1/2-inch dice. Meanwhile, cook the potatoes in lightly salted boiling
  water for 10 minutes.  Add the carrots and cook until the vegetables
  are tender, but not mushy, about 10 minutes more. Let cool until easy
  to handle, then cut the vegetables into 1/2-inch dice.  In a large
  salad bowl, combine the potatoes, carrots, onion, pickles, peas,
  beet, scallions, and dill. Season with salt and pepper and toss
  gently, taking care not to crush the vegetables.  In a small bowl,
  whisk the dry mustard, sugar and vinegar together. Whisk in the oil
  and season with salt and pepper. Toss the salad with the dressing and
  tasting to correct the seasoning. Cover and refrigerate for at least
  30 minutes before serving.

  "Vinegar is a preservative & therefore the vindaloo may be kept in the
  refrigerator for several days before using. In fact, the flavour are
  intensified if the vindaloo is eaten one or two days before cooking,
  warm slightly. ... The vindaloo requires that a substantial amount of
  oil be used in the preparation. For our purpose & without
  compromising the flavor, I have suggested that the excess oil be
  poured off before dining. Toasting & grinding the whole spice seeds
  is the old-time method & very effective in deriving the most flavor.
  However, I have also lightly toasted ground spices, which is an
  improvement over using them directly from the container. The recipe
  is one prepared by the Bhatia Christians of Calcutta, a group of
  Anglo-Indians who have intermarried with Bengali Indians."
  
  Lightly toast the coriander, poppy, mustard seeds, & cumin seeds in a
  dry skillet for 2 or 3 minutes until the aroma is released. Grind the
  seeds in a processor to a fine powder. Set aside. Heat the oil in a
  pan & add all the toasted dry spices, the chili flakes ginger and
  garlic. Stir fry over moderately low heat for 2 min. Add the meat &
  stir continuously for 10 minutes as the meat browns. Add the water,
  cover the pan & cook until the meats are tender, about 1 hour. When
  the meats have been fully tenderized, add the vinegar & continue to
  cook until the vinegar evaporates & the oil has risen. This is an
  indication that the vindaloo is ready. At this stage, all the oil may
  be poured off before serving. Serve warm with plain white rice &
  masoor dal.

   Fry,  stirring frequently, until the onions turn brown  and crisp.
    Remove  the onions with a slotted spoon and put them into the
  container of  an  electric blender or food processor. (Turn off the
  heat.) Add 2-3 tablespoons of water to the  blender  and  puree  the

  any. Put the ginger and garlic into the container of an electric
  blender or food processor. Add 2-3 tablespoons of water and blend
  until you have a smooth paste. Heat the oil remaining in the pot once
  again over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in the pork cubes, a
  few at a time, and brown them lightly on all sides. Remove each batch
  with a slotted spoon and keep in a bowl. Do all the pork this way.
   Now put the ginger-garlic paste into the same pot. Turn down the
  heat to medium.   Stir the paste for a few seconds. Add the coriander
  and turmeric.  Stir for another few seconds. Add the meat, any juices
  that may have accumulated as  well  as  the vindaloo paste and the
  water. Bring to a boil.  Cover and simmer gently for an hour or until
  port is tender. Stir a few times during this cooking period. Serve

 Categories: Mixes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 tb Cayenne
      4 tb Cumin
      2 tb Turmeric
      2 tb Black pepper
      2 tb Hot mustard powder
      2 tb Salt
      2 ts Ground ginger
      1 ts Cinnamon
    3/4 c  White vinegar
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil
 
  From this you can "vindaloo" anything you want chicken, beef, pork,
  tofu, or just plains veggies.
    Place all the spices and the salt in a mixing bowl and stir in the
  vinegar. Keep blending with a spoon until a paste is formed. Heat the
  oil in a sauce pan over medium-high heat and add the paste. Reduce
  the heat immediately to low and stir steadily and vigorously,
  scraping the bottom of the saucepan to make sure the spices do not
  stick or burn. (Don't put your face over the pan, as the pungent
  vapors from the spices witll make your eyes water.)  Stir constantly
  for about 8 minutes, or until the spices have cooked and mellowed and
  the oilis exuded from the mixture to the edges of the pan. Set aside
  to cool. When the mixture has cooled, spoon it into a jar, complete
  with any oil, and cap tightly. The paste will keep indefinitely in
  the refrigerator and, if the jar has been sterilized, will keep for
  at least 6 months on the shelf. Use 1 tablespoon to every 1.5 pounds
  of meat (more if you like it spicy.) Norma Wrenn

      Title: VINEGAR TAFFY
 Categories: Candies
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Water
    1/4 c  Light corn syrup
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Vinegar
      1 ts Vanilla or other flavoring
           -such as orange or lemon, or
           -use:
    1/2 ts Peppermint or:
      1 oz Bitter chocolate, grated
 
  From Grandma Ruby's recipe file: newspaper clipping
  
  Cook sugar, water, corn syrup, salt and vinegar until a few drops of
  the mixture will make a hard ball in cold water, 260 degrees on a
  candy thermometer.  Pour onto a greased dish or platter, sprinkle
  flavoring over top and turn the outer edges of the candy in toward
  the center until cool and firm enough to handle.
  
  Best results are obtained in pulling if the tips of the thumbs and
  fingers are dipped in cornstarch or fat. Use only the fingertips to
  pull taffy. When mixture can be handled, take up and pull out with
  both hands. Fold over and pull out again.
  
  As the mixture becomes cooler and the longer it is pulled, it will
  become stiffer and can be pulled out in a longer strand. Pull until
  it is difficult to pull out and the mixture seems quite firm.
  
  Pull into long thin strips and cut immediately with greased scissors
  and roll each piece in powdered sugar or wrap in wax paper. Store
  cooled taffy in an air tight container in a cool dry place.
  
  If the taffy sugars, it can be recooked by putting it in a pan with 2
  Tablespoons corn syrup and 1/4 cup water. Stir until dissolved and
  then recook according to original directions.
  
  Finely chopped nuts or fruit, as well as other flavorings, are added
  as the taffy is being pulled.
  
  I wish I had a date for this...I'd say recipe is at _least_ 30 years
  old...possibly 40, maybe even more... This is a lesson to all of you
  to date your recipes, including newspaper clippings!

      Title: VIOLET VINEGAR
 Categories: Condiments
      Yield: 2 Pints
 
      4 c  Wild purple violets
      4 c  Rice vinegar
 
  Pack 2 pint jars tightly with the violets.  Pour the vinegar
  (unheated) over the violets.  Cover tightly and allow to stand in a
  sunny window for 4 or 5 days; the violets will bleach out and the
  vinegar become a marvelous pale lavender.  Strain and keep
  refrigerated.
  
  NOTE:  The original recipe called for cider vinegar, but to capture
  the delicate color and flavor of the violets, I use Japanese rice
  vinegar, which is not as strong or as dark as cider vinegar.

 Categories: Vietnam, Meats
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  Shelled peanuts, red skin
           -removed
    1/2 c  Chestnuts, either fresh or
           -dried
    1/2 c  Ginkgo nuts, canned or fresh
    1/2 c  Dried lotus seeds
      8    Dried Chinese mushrooms
    1/2 c  Red dates (jujubes)
      1    Duck (about 5 pounds)
           Salt
      1 tb Finely chopped fresh ginger
           -root
      3    Shallots, chopped fine
      2    Eighteen-inch pieces of
           -sugar cane (if unavailable,
           -omit)
           Clear water from 1 coconut
      1 ts Rock sugar
      1 tb Fish sauce
      3    Scallions, both green part
           -and white, cut into 4
           -pieces crosswise
           Black pepper to taste
           Fresh coriander, chopped
 
  Prepare the various nuts, the lotus seeds, dried mushrooms, and red
  dates as follows: Soak the peanuts in hot water for 30 minutes; drain
  and set aside. If using dried chestnuts, boil for 20 minutes, drain,
  and set aside. If using fresh ginkgo nuts, remove the shell and
  blanch to remove the thin inner skin; set aside. Soak the Chinese
  mushrooms in hot water for 20 minutes, then drain, remove the stems
  and cut into quarters; set aside. Boil the dried lotus seeds for 20
  minutes; drain and set aside. Soak the red dates in hot water for 30
  minutes. (If they are very dry, boil for 10 minutes.) Drain and set
  aside. Rinse and clean the duck. Rub salt over the duck and rinse
  off; let dry for 10 minutes. Combine the ginger, shallots, and 1
  teaspoon salt. Rub the inside of the duck with the mixture. Combine
  the peanuts, chest- nuts, ginkgo nuts, lotus seeds, and 1 teaspoon
  salt and stuff the duck. Sew the duck closed with heavy white thread,
  or else use skewers. Peel the sugar cane and cut into thin lengthwise
  strips, the same length as the duck. Place 3 pieces of white kitchen
  string on a flat surface, long enough to tie the slices of sugar cane
  around the duck, covering the entire surface. Bring the string around
  and tie as you would a roast. Turn the duck over and slide the
  remaining strips under the string, covering the entire duck with the
  sugar cane. Pour the coconut water into a large pot. Put the duck
  into the pot and add enough water to completely cover. Add the rock
  sugar and 1 teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil and remove the scum
  continuously for 15 minutes, then turn the heat down, cover, and keep
  at a lively bubble for 2 hours. Turn the duck every 30 minutes. After
  2 hours, remove the duck from the pot; untie and discard the sugar
  cane. To the liquid remaining in the pot add the mushrooms, red
  dates, 1 teaspoon salt, and the fish sauce. Boil, covered, for 15
  minutes, then remove the duck to the broth, cover, and simmer for an
  additional 15 minutes. Remove the duck and add the scallion pieces to
  the broth. To serve, break the duck, with the bones, into 8 pieces.
  Put the pieces in individual bowls and add broth, some of the various
  nuts that were stuffed into the duck, red dates, and mushrooms.
  Sprinkle with black pepper and chopped fresh coriander.

      Title: VIX VIVAX--ROMULAN RAISIN/WALNUT BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      4 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 tb Light molasses
      2 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Sour cream
      2 pk Dry yeast
     13 c  Flour (more or less)
      2 c  Golden raisins
      2 c  Walnuts; coarsely chopped
      1    Egg; for glaze
 
  ***This makes 4 loaves of bread Scald the milk. Add the butter, sugar,
  molasses and salt. Let it cool for about 10 minutes and add the sour
  cream, beating with a wire whisk to mix it all thoroughly. Pour it
  into a large bowl. When the liquid is cool enough so that a drop on
  the inside of your wrist is not hot enough to hurt, add the yeast.
  (if you add yeast to the hot mixture, you will kill the yeast and the
  bread will not rise.) Add about 5 cups of flour, 1 cup at a time, and
  mix it well with the liquid, breaking up lumps as you mix. Add
  raisins and walnuts. Add flour, 1 cup at a time, until the dough is
  no longer very sticky; it should be right when you have added about
  12 cups. Sprinkle out about 1/4 to 1/2 cup flour onto a clean board
  or countertop. Dump the dough onto the floury place and scrape out
  the bowl onto the dough. Wash, dry and grease the bowl. Now, knead
  the dough for about 15 to 20 minutes using up the last of the flour.
  It should feel stretchy and elastic. Put the dough into the greased
  bowl and grease the top. Cover it will a damp cloth and set it in a
  warm place to rise. It may take as much as 2 hours until it is double
  in bulk. When it has doubled in bulk, flour a place on the counter,
  dump it out and knead it again for about 5 minutes. Divide the dough
  into 4 equal parts and grease 4 bread pans. Shape the dough into
  loaves and put 1 in each pan. Cover the pans with a damp cloth and
  let the dough rise until about double in bulk, about 1 hour. Preheat
  the oven to 325 degrees, brush the tops of the loaves with beaten
  egg, and put them in the oven. Bake at 325 for 30 minutes and then at
  300 degrees for another 30 minutes. The loaves will sound "hollow"
  when tapped when they are done. Take them out of the oven as soon as
  they are done. Turn them out of the pan onto cake racks. The bread is
  best served warm, but it may be cooled and then frozen to save.

 Categories: Digest, August
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Short grain brown rice
           (measure uncooked)
    1/2 c  Onion (finely diced)
    2/3 c  Carrot (minced or grated)
    1/2 ts Dry basil
    1/2 ts Dry thyme
    1/2 ts Black pepper (coarse grind)
    1/4 c  Tamari
 
  Cook the rice so that it comes out a bit dry (if it is very sticky
  and damp let it dry some by spreading it on a tray for a while.)
  After the rice cools, add all other ingredients, mix well, and sort
  of knead the mixture a bit until it feels a bit sticky. Form into
  patties about 4 inches round and about 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick (don't
  make them to thin). Place on a nonstick baking sheet, and put into a
  preheated 450 degree oven. Let cook for about 25 minutes, flip and
  cook for another 10 to 15 minutes. If the mixture was too wet the
  burgers will kind of flow and get thin. When you are making the
  patties you will probably think that this can't be done. My family
  loves these with onion tomato and coarse mustard. Thanks to a kind
  person at the local Wellspring Grocery and Deli who was kind enough
  to share a recipe with their customers.

           -and drained
    1/2    To 3/4 cup non-fat yogurt
           -(depending on how creamy
           -you want it)
           -juice of one lemon
      2    -4 cloves of garlic,
           -crushed (depending on how
           -much you like garlic-
      2    Is enough for me, but
           -others I know insist on
           -more)
    1/4 ts Ground cumin
           -dash of black pepper
 
  optional, depending on how strict you want to be about the vlf: 6
  drops or so of toasted sesame oil (doesn't add dramatically to the
  fat, but *greatly* improves the flavor for us "real" hummus fans -
  makes up partially for the lack of tahini)
  
  Combine all ingredients in blender and blend smooth. Garnish with a
  dash of paprika and serve w/pita triangles, in a sandwich, etc. My
  favorite is hummus on a pita with carrots, cucumbers, and lettuce
  (that was lunch today, in fact!)  Hummus is so easy to make that you
  can whip it up while eating breakfast to take to work (like I did
  today) for all you people looking for quick lunch ideas.

  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
    1/2 ts Almond extract

  These are extremely low in fat, and the taste is more slightly bitter
  dark chocolate than the milk-chocolate sweet of most brownies,
  however if you love chocolate, they're a great treat!
  
  In a large bowl sift flour, cocoa, salt, baking powder and packed
  brown sugar. In small bowl beat until creamy vanilla, almond extract,
  egg whites and honey.
  
  Combine and mix well.  Pour into a 13 x 9 baking pan sprayed with
  non-stick spray.  Bake at 375 (350 glass) 15-20 minutes. Poke with a
  toothpick and if it comes out with fudgy crumbs, it's done.
  
  Do not overbake!  Cool completely before cutting into pieces. You can
  add chopped nuts, however it will raise the fat content substantially.

 Categories: Condiment, Jamaican, Caribbean
      Yield: 2 Cups
 
           10-12 scotch bonnets or
           Habanero, serrano, jalapeno
      6 cl Garlic, peeled and chopped
    1/3 c  Fresh lime juice
    1/3 c  Distilled white vinegar
      2 tb Dijon style mustard
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 ts Molasses
    1/2 ts Turmeric
      1 tb Salt or to taste
 
  Combine the pepper, garlic, lime juice, vinegar, mustard, oil,
  molasses, turmeric, and slat in a blender and puree until smooth.
  Correct the seasoning, adding more salt or molasses to taste.
  
  Transfer the sauce to a clean bottle.  You can use it right away, but
  the flavor will improve if you let it age for a few days. Volcanic
  Hot Sauce will keep almost indefinitely, refrigerated or at room
  temperature. Just give it a good shake before using.

      Title: VOLCANO WINGS
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      2 lb -3 lbs. chicken wings, split
           -and rinsed.
     16 oz Box Fry Magic chicken
           -coating*
     12 oz Bottle Red Devil Cayenne
           -Pepper Sauce*
      1 ea Stick butter
 
  Melt butter in sauce pan, stir in Red devil sauce, let simmer over low
  heat. Pour approx. 4 oz. Fry Magic in gallon size zipper bag. Dip
  chicken pieces in water and shake in bag, coat well. Fry chicken
  pieces in 1/4" oil, 5 minutes per side. (Electric skillet at 350
  works great.) Remove chicken pieces from skillet and drain on paper
  towel. Dip chicken pieces in sauce mixture, place on serving platter
  until "dry" looking, dip pieces in sauce again and place back in
  skillet to cook another 10-15 minutes per side. Remove chicken from
  skillet and place on paper towel to drain. Dip once again in sauce
  and serve.
  
  *may substitute like brands.
  
  This method of preparing the wings was devised after about 2 months of
  testing different methods each Sunday during football season. The
  recipe calls for 2-3 lbs. of wings, but if your friends and family
  are anything like mine, you'll need to double it, and maybe more!
  (Especially for those playoff weekends). The reason we use a coating
  mix is that after the initial frying time, the coating really absorbs
  the hot sauce (this is what all the other recipes I've run across
  lack). Then the final frying finishes cooking the chicken and seals
  up the hot sauce coating. Dipping the pieces before serving provides
  the final texture and flavor.

 Categories: Drinks, Alcohol
      Yield: 32 Servings
 
    3/4 c  Packed light brown sugar
      1    3-inch piece fresh ginger
      2 tb Peppercorns, whole
      1 tb Allspice, whole
      4    Cinnamon sticks
      2 c  Water
      1    Large block of ice
     26 oz Dark Caribbean rum
     26 oz Vodka
      2 c  Orange juice
    1/2 c  Pineapple juice
     10    Flowers, see note
     10    Lemon slices
 
  Peel ginger and slice thinly.  In a 1-quart saucepan, combine brown
  sugar, ginger, peppercorns, allspice, cinnamon sticks and water.
  Bring to boil; then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes.
  Strain, discarding spices; chill.  If made ahead, set aside until
  ready to use. To prepare punch for serving place ice block (should be
  2 quarts) in punch bowl. Add chilled syrup, rum, vodka, orange juice
  and pineapple juice. Taste and add more juices, if desired. Poke stem
  of each flower through the center of a lemon slice; float slices atop
  punch.  Serve each drink over ice cubes.
  
  A few notes:  I find this recipe a little sweet, so I add the juice
  of a lemon or two before serving.  The flowers that the recipe
  suggests are daisies or hibiscus. It then suggests "other flowers"
  but this is something to be really careful about, since the first
  time I served this punch some idiot decided to try the flowers!
  (takes all kinds). This is a really good for a hot summer night (yes
  we do get them in Canada) - very potent punch.

 Categories: Christmas, Russian, Breads
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
      2 c  Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
      1 ts Salt
      1 lg Egg Yolk
    1/2 c  Evaporated Milk; OR
    1/2 c  Whole Milk
      1 ts Oil Or Mrlted Butter
 
  Combine the flour and salt, blending well.  Add the milk, egg yolk,
  and oil, again blending well.  Allow to rest for 5 minutes. Knead for
  about minutes and form into a ball. (This may be done in a
  processor.) Cover and set aside for 15 minutes or so.  On a floured
  surface, roll out a third of the dough, into a rectangle 1/8th inch
  thick. Turn the dough and roll from the center, so that all the dough
  in the rectangle is even in thickness. Run a hand under the dough to
  loosen it. Dust with flour and flip over and dust with flour.  With a
  sharp knife, cut into 1 1/2-inch squares. Place a teaspoon of
  mushroom filling (see the next recipe in this series) in each square,
  being careful not to smear the edges.  Fold on the diagonal to make a
  triangle.  Pinch together the two bottom corners, wrapping it around
  your thumb with the point up (to resemble small ears on a cat),
  making sure that the edges have bonded or the stuffing will boil out.
  Place on cookie sheets covered with dish towels lightly dusted with
  flour. Repeat with the other pieces of dough, saving the scraps for
  last as the dough gets a little tougher when worked.  Drop 10 or 12
  vushka into 6 to 8 cups of rapidly boiling water and stir once with a
  wooden spoon, (The wooden spoon is very important as a metal one will
  lower the temperature of the water.) Do NOT cover.  When they float
  to the top, cook 1 minut, then remove with a slotted spoon to a
  strainer. Cool on a lightly oiled plate without crowding.  Repeat
  until all are cooked. Cover and set aside. These may be frozen and
  then reheated in boiling water. (DO NOT overcook when reheating.)
  
  TO SERVE:
  
  Place 4 or 5 vushka in soup plates and pour hot borsch over them.

      Title: WAFFLE CONE
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 20 Cones
 
      3    Eggs
    3/4 c  Sugar, granulated
    1/2 c  Butter, melted
      2 ts Vanilla
  1 1/2 c  Flour
      2 ts Baking powder
 
  Beat the eggs and gradually beat in the sugar until the mixture is
  creamy. Stir in the melted butter and vanilla.
  
  Combine the flour and baking powder, and then add it to the mixture.
  Blend it in well.
  
  Drop about 4 t of the batter into a heated pizelle iron, and cook both
  sides over medium-high heat for about 1 minute each, or until golden
  brown.
  
  Remove the waffle from the pizelle iron and immediately shape it into
  a cone while it is still pliable.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Waffle ice-cream cone, pizelles -- This recipe comes from a recent
  issue of _Canadian Living_ magazine. Waffle cones look like round
  waffles shaped into a cone and have a wonderful taste. (I admit it,
  I'm hooked on them.) This recipe is actually for a type of cookie
  called the pizelle, but it tastes just like the waffle cones you can
  get at an ice-cream parlor. Yield:  about 20 cones.
  
  *  A pizelle iron looks like a round waffle iron. There are "manual"
  irons and electric ones too.  If you don't have a pizelle iron,
  another idea is to use an ordinary waffle iron and have ice-cream on
  top of the waffle. Not having either a waffle iron or a pizelle iron,
  we tried making these on an electric griddle, but since the batter is
  fairly thick it wouldn't spread into a large enough circle to make
  cones from.
  
  *  When you form the cones, there will probably be a small hole in the
  bottom of them that ice-cream can drip out of. One idea for plugging
  this hole is to put miniature marshmallows in the bottoms of the
  cones.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  5 minutes preparation, 1-2 minutes (per cone) cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      4 ea Eggs
      2 ts Vanilla
      2 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Cocoa

MMMMM--------------------------FROSTING-------------------------------
 
  Beat together sugar and butter until creamy. Beat eggs with vanilla
  and stir into butter mixture. Sift together dry ingredients and stir
  into creamed mixture. Batter will be quite stiff.
  
  Drop a heaping teaspoonful of batter into each section of a hot waffle
  iron. Close lid and bake one to 1 1/2 minutes. Do not allow cookies
  to cook until crisp. Cookies will burn if not removed promptly. Use
  fork to remove cookies and place on racks to cool.
  
  Immediately close lid of waffle iron to reheat, one to two minutes.
  Meanwhile frost just baked cookie while warm, using recipe below or
  your favourite frosting. Re-open waffle iron and repeat procedure.
  Continue until all batter is used. Cookies will have ragged edges
  characteristic of the waffle iron. Blend together, 1 cup
  confectioner's sugar, one tablespoon butter, one teaspoon vanilla,
  two tablespoons cocoa and enough cream or milk to make a smooth,
  spreadable frosting.

      Title: WAFFLES - HISTORY
 Categories: Breads, Breakfast
      Yield: 1 Info file
 
           Text
 
  Waffles are as American as apple pie, and like apple pie are an
  import. The word "waffle" and probably the food, comes to us from the
  Dutch "wafel", but the French eat them too, calling them "gaufre"
  from the Old French "wafla".  Whatever their provenance, waffles have
  been eaten by Americans since Pilgrim times.
  
  Europeans eat their waffles as a sweet course, topping them with
  powdered sugar, whipped cream, or honey or stuffing them with icing.
  Americans have occasionally served waffles for dessert - perhaps a
  chocolate waffle with ice cream - but in general we eat them for
  breakfast with all-American maple syrup.  At least NOW we do, if we
  eat waffles at all.
  
  But in the Thirties, and before that, Americans ate waffles with
  virtually anything that could be spooned or poured over their bumpy,
  golden tops. And we ate them for breakfast, for luncheon, and for
  supper. If we served them to guests at a Sunday Night Supper, it
  became a waffle supper, "sure to be a party guests remember,"
  according to the General Foods cookbook "All About Home Baking"
  (1933).
  
  And we made waffles with just about everything: Cheese waffles;
  cornmeal waffles; coconut, pineapple, and chocolate waffles;
  gingerbread waffles; banana waffles; cheese and tomato, date, and
  peanut butter waffles; apple waffles; oatmeal waffles; and prune,
  bran, apricot, and even pea pulp waffles (which Pictorial Review
  featured as one of their best recipes for 1927.)

      Title: WALKER'S RED HOT CHILE CON CARNE (1918)
 Categories: Chile peppe, Chili, Texas cooki
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lb Beef -- cut in small pieces
    1/4 lb Beef suet -- ground fine or
           Lard
      2 tb Walker's Mexene
      1 md Onion -- minced
           Water
 
  In 1918, Walker Austex was producing 45,000 cans of Walker's Red Hot
  Chile Con Carne (with beans) and 15,000 cans of Mexene Chili Powder a
  day in their new factory in Austin, Texas. But Walker had already
  been selling canned Mexican foods for over a quarter century and may
  have been the first to can chili. Gebhardt's didn't start canning
  chili (as opposed to making chili powder) until 1911. Walker's 1918
  recipe booklet had recipes for "chile huevos" and "chili mac" ~- plus
  something called "combination chili con carne" -- one can chili mixed
  with one can tomatoes.
  
  Genuine Mexican Chile Con Carne. One pound of beef cut in small
  pieces; 1/4 lb. beef suet, ground fine (or you can use lard). Add two
  tablespoons of Walker's Mexene, one medium sized onion minced; add
  water and boil until thoroughly cooked. The gravy from this chili con
  carne is fine for macaroni, spaghetti and vegetables. If beans are
  wanted, use any good red bean. For instance -- California Bayous,
  California Pinks or Pinto Beans. When these are not convenient, use
  French Red Kidney Beans. Boil the beans separately and add beans when
  serving.

  Place the fish fillets in the egg and buttermilk mixture. Now, the
  Cambridge sauce. In a small bowl combine egg, anchovy fillets, capers,
  chopped herbs, Dijon mustard, vinegar, cayenne, and salt and pepper.
  Stir and mash together thoroughly. Then gradually add the oil and
  incorporate completely. You should end up with a mayonnaise type
  consistency. Place vegetable oil in a deep saute pan to come no more
  than 1/3 up the side of the pan. Heat until a deep fat fry
  thermometer registers 350 degrees. Meanwhile, in a shallow bowl
  combine the flour and cornmeal, and season with the Creole spice.
  Coat the fish fillets with the flour mixture. Carefully drop the fish
  fillets into the saute pan and fry until golden, about 8 minutes.
  Meanwhile, spread the bread slices with a generous coating of the
  Cambridge sauce. Remove the fish from the pan and drain on paper
  towels. Place each piece on a slice of bread and top with another
  slice. Garnish with the pickles.

      Title: WALLEYES IN RED WINE SAUCE
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Salt and fresh pepper
      1 c  Boiling water
      4    Walleyes, cleaned
      2    Bay leaves
      2 tb Flour for dredging
    1/2 ts Thyme
      1    Onion, minced
      1 tb Tomate pureee
      6 tb Olive oil
      2 tb Capers
      2    Cloves garlic, minced
      3 tb Chopped parsley
      1 c  Red wine
 
  Salt and pepper the fish and dredge in flour.  Shake off excess.
    In a heavy saucepan saute the onion in 2 Tbs. olive oil. When
  translucent, add the garlic and slowly saute another minute. Stir in 2
  tablespoons flour, blend well, and cook, stirring for a minute or
  two. Off heat pour in the wine and boiling water; whisk thoroughly.
  Return to heat, whisking as the sauce thickens. Add bay leaves,
  thyme, and tomato puree. Let simmer while you sear the fish.
    In a pan large enough to hold the 4 walleyes in one layer, heat the
  remaining oil and when hot, but nor smoking, sear the fish quickly on
  each side.
    Now, pour the red wine sauce over the fish.  Bring to a boil, then
  quickly lower the heat.  Cover and let simmer for about 15 minutes.
    Just before serving remove the bay leaves, adjust the seasoning (the
  sauce will probably need salt and pepper), toss the capers in, and
  sprinkle with chopped parsley on top.
