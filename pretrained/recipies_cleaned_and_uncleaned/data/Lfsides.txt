  14 1/2  ounces        reduced sodium chicken broth -- defatted
   4      cups          water
   1      teaspoon      salt
   2      slices        bacon -- diced
   1                    onion -- chopped
   1      cup           arborio rice
   1      small         butternut squash -- peeled and diced
                        --3 cups
     1/2  cup           freshly grated parmesan cheese
     1/4  teaspoon      freshly ground black pepper

1. In a medium saucepan, bring chicken broth, water and salt to a simmer. Reduce heat and keep at a bare simmer. 2. Meanwhile, in a Dutch oven or large deep sauté pan, cook bacon over low heat until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside on a paper towel. Discard rendered fat. Return pan to heat, add onion and cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in rice and squash; cook for 1 minute more. 3. Ladle 1 cup simmering broth into rice mixture and cook, stirring, until most of the liquid has been absorbed, about 1 minute. Continue stirring and adding broth as it is absorbed, 1/2 cup at a time, until squash is tender and mixture is creamy. (Adjust heat as necessary to prevent scorching yet maintain a lively simmer.) Total cooking time will be 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from heat. 4. Stir in 1/4 cup Parmesan, reserved bacon and pepper. Serve hot, passing remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan separately. MAKES 6 CUPS, FOR 4 SERVINGS.

   2      tablespoons   olive oil -- divided
   1      cup           thinly sliced leeks
                        --white and light green parts
   1      tablespoon    finely minced garlic
   1      tablespoon    dried tarragon leaves
   3      cups          boiling water
   1      cup           finely chopped red cabbage
     1/2  cup           chopped watercress leaves
     1/4  cup           finely chopped red onion
   2      tablespoons   drained capers -- (up to 3)
   1      tablespoon    freshly squeezed -- (up to 2)
                        lemon juice
                        salt -- to taste

1. Drain and rinse beans; set aside.

2. In pressure cooker, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil. Cook leeks and garlic over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, for 1 minute. Add the tarragon, water and reserved beans.

3. Lock lid in place. Over high heat, bring to high pressure. Lower heat just enough to maintain high pressure; cook 3 minutes. Allow pressure to come down naturally for 10 minutes. Quick-release any remaining pressure. Remove lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess steam to escape. If the beans am not tender, replace (but do not lock) the lid; simmer until done.

4. If time permits, allow the beans to sit in the cooker at room temperature with the lid slightly open about 2 hours, during which time they will absorb most of the excess liquid. If serving immediately, remove beans with a slotted spoon or drain off most of the liquid and transfer to a serving bowl.

5. Stir in the cabbage, watercress, onion and capers. Season with the remaining tablespoon olive oil, the lemon juice and salt to taste. Serve at room temperature.

   1 1/2  pound         small new red potatoes -- unpeeled

   2      tablespoons   finely chopped fresh basil
   1      tablespoon    balsamic vinegar
   1      teaspoon      salt
     1/4  teaspoon      freshly ground black pepper
     1/4  cup           freshly grated parmesan cheese

1. Preheat oven to 475°F. Place the potatoes on a baking sheet in the middle of the oven. Bake 45 to 50 minutes, until tender and slightly crisp; test with a knife or skewer. Remove and let cool. Leave the oven set at 475°F.

2. Meanwhile, make the filling: In large frying pan over medium heat, warm remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add onion and saute, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes, or until translucent. Add eggplant and cook 5 to 7 minutes, stirring, until it begins to soften. Add bell pepper and cook, stirring, 5 minutes longer. Add tomatoes, garlic, basil and vinegar, and continue cooking 5 to 10 minutes longer, or until the liquid evaporates and eggplant is soft. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.

3. Cut each potato in half crosswise. If bottoms are uneven, cut off a thin slice so they will stand upright once filled. Scoop out most of the pulp from each half, leaving only a thin shell; reserve inner pulp for another use. Return the potato shells to the baking sheet, hollow sides down, and brush the skins with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Bake 10 to 15 minutes, until crisp. Remove from oven and reduce the oven temperature to 425°F.

4. Sprinkle the insides of the potato shells with some of the Parmesan cheese. Spoon in the filling and place on an ungreased baking sheet. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake 10 to 15 minutes, or until heated through. Serve immediately.

   1      tablespoon    olive oil
   1      cup           coarsely chopped onions
   2      large         garlic cloves -- peeled
                        --and finely chopped
   1 1/2  cup           arborio rice
   3 1/2  cups          chicken
                        --or vegetable stock -- divided
                        --or more
   1      teaspoon      dried oregano
   1      teaspoon      salt
                        --less if using salted stock
     1/2  cup           pimiento-stuffed green olives -- coarsely chopped
   1      cup           cooked black beans
     1/3  cup           chopped fresh coriander
                        freshly ground black pepper -- to taste

1. In pressure cooker, heat the oil. Sauté the onions and garlic until soft but not brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in the rice, coating thoroughly with the oil.

2. Stir in 3 1/2 cups of the stock, the oregano and salt. Lock the lid in place and, over high heat, bring to high pressure. Lower the heat just enough to maintain high pressure; cook 5 minutes. Reduce pressure with a quick-release method. Remove lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess steam to escape.

3· The risotto will continue to absorb liquid at this point and should end up being slightly soupy. If necessary, stir in a bit more stock with the olives, black beans, coriander and pepper. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until rice is tender but chewy. Serve immediately in shallow soup bowls.

Makes 4 servings. Preparation time: About 20 minutes. Cooking time: About 10 minutes.
