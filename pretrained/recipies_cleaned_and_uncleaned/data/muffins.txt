"Gold Room" Scones

breads, muffins

3 2/3 cup flour
1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
2  eggs
3/4 cup whole milk
3/4 cup raisins
1/3 cup honey

Preheat the oven to 425F. Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder,
and salt in a large bowl. Mix well. Cut the butter into the flour
mixture with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse
cornmeal. Add the eggs, milk and raisings. Stir quickly with a fork
until the dough leaves the sides of the bowl and forms a ball. Spoon
onto an ungreased cookie sheet to form the desired number of scones.
Leave at least 1" between the scones. Bake until golden (about 12-15
minutes). Remove to a wire rack, and brush immediately with honey.
Serve at once with butter, jam and whipped cream.

Banana Molasses Muffins

breads, fruits, muffins

3 each bananas; ripe, md
1 each egg; large, unbeaten
2/3 cup sugar
2 tablespoon light molasses or syrup
2 tablespoon shortening, melted
2 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup walnuts; chopped, optional

Mash the bananas until no lumps remain.  Add the unbeaten egg, mixing
well. Beat in the sugar, molasses and the shortening. (NOTE: The
secret of this recipe is to mix the above ingredients well until very
smooth.) Sift the flour, baking power, soda, and salt together and
add to the liquid mixture. As these are a quick bread, do not beat
the dry mixture into the liquid but rather fold it in only until it
is moistened and no streaks remain. Spoon the mixture into a muffin
tin that has been sprayed with a non-stick coating.  Bake at 350
degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes or until done. Serve warm.

Blueberry Muffins

muffins

1 3/4 cup flour
6 tablespoon sugar
2 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1  egg, beaten
3/4 cup milk
1/3 cup cooking oil
3/4 cup blueberries
1 teaspoon lemon peel

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Stir together the flour, sugar, baking
powder and salt. Make a well in the center.

In a separate bowl, combine the egg, milk and oil.  Add egg mixture, all at
once, to the flour mixture.  Stir JUST until moistened.  Yes, the batter
should be lumpy.  (If you try to stir all the lumps out, your muffins will
be very tough.) CAREFULLY fold in blueberries and optional lemon peel.

Grease muffin cups, or line with paper bake cups; fill each 2/3 full. Bake
at 400 degrees F. for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from
pans; serve warm with butter.

NOTES:

*  Award-winning blueberry muffins -- these muffins won a blue ribbon
during the years that I was eligible for the Dade County (Miami, Florida)
Youth Fair. I think this particular recipe came originally from the "Better
Homes and Gardens Cookbook," but I could be wrong.

*  The less you stir once you've combined the two mixtures, the better your
muffins will be.  (To a point, but over-mixing is much more common than
under- mixing.) Frozen blueberries work fine, if you can't get hold of
fresh berries. I'm sure other kinds of fruit will work fine, too, but I
haven't tried them.

: Difficulty:  moderate (proper mixing technique required).
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 25 minutes baking.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

Bran Muffins

muffins

1  egg
1 3/4 cup cream
3/4 cup vegetable oil
1 cup wheat bran
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup dark molasses
3/4 cup whole wheat flour
3/4 cup rice flour
1/3 cup oatmeal, uncooked
1 cup nuts, chopped
3/4 cup raisins
3/4 cup dates, chopped

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease the bottoms of your muffin pan.
Chop the nuts and dates.

Beat the egg, then add to it cream and oil.  Mix this together well, then
mix in the bran and let it sit there and absorb liquid for about five
minutes.

In another large bowl measure and slightly blend the wheat and rice flour
and the oatmeal.

Now that it's been about five minutes, add the baking powder, salt and
molasses to the soaking bran and mix thoroughly.

Dump the bran mixture into the flour mixture and blend a bit, then fold in
the nuts, raisins and dates. Try not to mix too much because over-mixing
can degrade the texture of the muffins.

Fill muffin tins about to the top and bake at 350 degrees F. for about 25
minutes.  You can use milk instead of cream, but the muffins will not be as
rich and moist.

NOTES:

*  Very rich and moist muffins with bran, raisins, nuts and dates -- I
experimented a lot to find the ultimate bran muffin recipe.  I started with
a recipe from the "Betty Crocker Cookbook," but I've changed it enough that
I'm willing to take all the credit for it. Yield: 12 large muffins.

*  Using 1/3 hazelnuts and 2/3 walnuts adds a distinctive flavor.

*  I like to let the batter sit in the refrigerator for a while (a few
hours to overnight) before I bake it.

BRAN MUFFINS 2

muffins, breakfast

7/8 cup oil
8 oz egg substitute
2 cup 100 percent bran
1 quart buttermilk
5 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking powder directions:
2 1/2 cup sugar
4 cup all-bran
1 cup boiling water
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
5 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt (optional)

Mix oil and sugar thoroughly in a VERY LARGE bowl. Add egg
substitute, 2 ounces at a time and beat well. Mix together All Bran
and 100 percent Bran. Add boiling water. Stir and let cool.

Add buttermilk and vanilla to bran mixture. Sift together flour,
baking soda, baking powder and salt. Add bran mixture to the creamed
mixture, alternating with the flour. Do this in three portions. Stir
thoroughly to blend. If storing batter, store in tightly covered
container in refrigerator. This will keep up to 3 months. If using
stored batter, DO NOT STIR! To bake muffins, fill paper muffin cups
2/3 full. Bake at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until they test
done. Dates, nuts, raisins or glaced fruit may be sprinkled on top of
batter in bowl when filling muffin cups. This becomes a filling
inside the batter as muffin cups are filled. Muffins are very good
cold. They also may be re-heated or frozen after baking.

Bran Muffins Ii

muffins

1 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 cup bran, unprocessed
1 teaspoon baking soda
1  egg
4 teaspoon golden syrup
1 tablespoon butter
6 tablespoon sugar
1 cup milk
1 cup sultanas (or substitute raisins, da; tes, etc.)

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.  Dissolve the soda in the milk.

Sift the flour, baking powder and salt together.

Beat the egg well, then add the milk/soda.

Add the golden syrup and butter which have been heated together to melt the
butter.

Add the dry ingredients and mix quickly.  Put into greased muffin tins and
bake for 12-15 minutes at 425 degrees F.

NOTES:

*  Tasty muffins with bran and dried fruit -- This is a simple New Zealand
recipe based on golden syrup.  The muffins make a delicious alternative to
scones.  We eat them buttered, either hot or cold. I've added the dried
fruit to the original recipe as it makes them much more interesting.

*  Golden syrup is a very thick sugar syrup that is readily available in
countries where people drive on the left-hand side of the road, but seems
to be rare elsewhere. If the gourmet section of your supermarket does not
carry it, you could try substituting some kind of honey, such as sage
honey.

*  Any dried fruit can be used instead of sultanas, e.g. raisins, dates -
whatever strikes your fancy.

Chocolate Chip Muffins

muffins

3/4 cup milk
1/4 cup butter, melted
1  egg
1 3/4 cup flour, all-purpose
1/3 cup brown sugar, packed
2 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup chocolate chips, semisweet
1/2 cup walnuts, chopped

Heat oven to 400 degrees F.; line 12 medium muffin cups with paper
baking cups or grease bottoms only of muffin cups.

Beat milk, margarine and egg.  Stir in remaining ingredients, all at
once, just until flour is moistened (batter will be lumpy). Fill
muffin cups about 2/3 full. Bake 18 to 20 minutes or until golden
brown.

Her notes:

*  I don't use paper baking cups. I spray with Pam only the bottoms
of the muffin depressions in the pan. I always increase the amount of
chocolate chips and nuts a little because I like them and I usually
think recipes are chintzy with them.

*  Use a fork to loosen them and tip them up in the pan as soon as
they come out of the oven. That way you'll get a crisper crust on the
bottom and sides.

Chocolate Chocolate Chunk Muffins

muffins

4 oz unsalted butter
2 oz unsweetened chocolate
2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk, at room temperature
1 cup packed dark brown sugar
1  egg, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
6 oz milk chocolate, cut into 1/4 to 1/2; pieces
6 oz bittersweet chocolate, cut into 1/4; to 1/2 pieces
1 cup toasted walnuts, coarsely chopped (; *)

(*)  Place the walnuts in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake
at 400 degrees for about 5 minutes, shaking the sheet a couple of
times. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Lightly butter twelve 3-by-1 1/4
inch muffin cups.

In a medium saucepan, over low heat, melt the butter and unsweetened
chocolate.  Remove the pan from the heat and cool the mixture until
tepid. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda and
salt. In another bowl, stir together the buttermilk and brown sugar
until smooth. Then stir in the chocolate/butter mixture, egg and
vanilla until combined. Make a well in the center of the flour
mixture. Add the liquid ingredients and stir just to combine. Stir in
the chocolates and walnuts.

Spoon the batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups. Bake 19 to 22
minutes, or until a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center
of one muffin comes out with a few crumbs remaining. Remove the
muffin tin or tins to a wire rack.  Cool the muffins in the pan(s)
for 5 minutes. Remove the muffins from the cups and finish cooling on
the rack. Serve warm or cool completely.  Store the muffins in an
airtight container at room temperature. Makes about 12 muffins.

Chocolate Crumble Coffee Cake Muffins

breads, muffins

      ----CRUMBLE MIXTURE----
2 oz ghirardelli sweet dark chocolate
2 tablespoon packed brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon grated fresh orange rind
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon instant coffee
1 tablespoon cold butter
1/4 cup pecans
      ----COFFEE CAKE MIXTURE----
1 3/4 cup unsifted flour
2/3 cup sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup cold butter
1  egg
1/2 cup half & half
1  egg yolk
2 teaspoon water

Servings: 12

DIRECTIONS: Crumble mixture: Place pieces of broken chocolate and
brown sugar in food processor or blender. Process about 15 to 20
seconds or until as fine as coarse ground coffee. Add orange rind,
cinnamon, coffee, butter and pecans. Process a short time until nuts
are finely chopped. Set aside.

Coffee Cake: Place flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in food
processor; process for a few seconds to combine or prepare by hand
using a pastry blender. Sprinkle small butter cubes over dry
ingredients. Process only 5-6 seconds to distribute butter into very
small pieces, or use pastry blender. Transfer to a bowl. Spread
mixture to form a well in the center. Beat whole egg lightly with
half & half. Pour, all at once, into dry ingredients. Using a folding
motion, stir to combine ingredients- mixing only until liquid is all
absorbed. (Do not overmix. This should take only 15-20 hand strokes.)
Sprinkle the crumble mixture over dough in bowl. With a table knife,
draw across in 2 directions to marble crumble with dough. (Do not
combine thoroughly.) Heavily grease cups of muffin pans, disposable
foil pans, glass custard cups or cupcake liners. When portioning
dough, mixture will be rough but will come together after baking. To
make large size muffins, fill cups level to top, yielding 9 muffins.
For medium muffins, fill cups 2/3 full, yielding 12 muffins. Prepare
egg wash by mixing water with egg yolk. Brush muffins with egg wash.
Bake at 400-F for 15-17 minutes, depending upon the size of the
muffins. Muffins should be golden brown and baked in the center. Cool
in pans about 5 minutes to firm muffins before removing. Serve warm.

Coffee Cake Muffins

muffins

1/2 cup pecans; finely chopped
1/3 cup light brown sugar; firmly packed
1 1/2 cup plus 1 tabl. flour
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
1 tablespoon butter or margarine; melted
1/3 cup sugar
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup vegetable shortening
1/2 cup milk
1  egg
12  pecan halves; optional

Preheat oven to 375 degree F. Grease 12 muffin pan cups; set aside.
In a small bowl; mix together pecans, brown sugar, 1 T flour,
cinnamon, nutmeg, and butter; set aside.

In a medium bowl, sift together 1 1/2 cups flour, granulated sugar,
baking powder and salt; cut in shortening. In a small bowl, blend egg
with milk. Add to dry ingredients with half of the pecan mixture,
stirring until just blended.  Spoon batter into muffin cups; sprinkle
with remaining pecan mixture.  Garnish each muffin with a pecan half.
Bake 15 minutes or until cake tester inserted in center comes out
clean. Remove muffins from pan to cool on wire rack.

Mixing muffin ingredients requires a special, but easy-to-learn
technique. The liquid ingredients (milk, eggs, etc.) are beaten
together and then added all at once to the dry ingredients. Mixing is
kept to a minimum--just enough to moisten the dry ingredients. The
batter should be lumpy, not smooth. These muffins freeze very well.

Cranberry-Orange Muffins

muffins, low cal

3/4 cup natural bran
3/4 cup flour
1/2 cup sugar (diabetic try 1/4 cup)
1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/3 cup cranberry sauce
1  egg, lightly beaten
1/3 cup soured milk (1/2 tb lemon j)
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 teaspoon grated orange rind

You may use commercial or home made cranberry sauce but not
artifically sweetened sauce (muffins will not rise.) . Original
recipe in The Lighthearted Cookbook by Anne Lindsay published in 1988
in Canada used whole-wheat flour, and 1/2 cup buttermilk or low-fat
plain yogurt rather than sour milk.

1/12 original recipe - 156 calories, 1 starch, 1 fat, 1 fruit choice 5
grams fat, 2 grams protein, 27 grams carbohydrate, 23 mg cholesterol,
126 mg sodium   NOTE: listed ingredients & variations would be
slightly different.

Preheat oven to 400 F and spray at least 12 muffin cups lined with
paper baking cups.  Low-fat muffins tend to stick even to non-stick
pans.

Measure 1/2 tbsp lemon juice in a measuring cup, fill to about 1/4
cup mark with fluid milk and add some skim milk powder to make it a
little thicker. Set aside.

Combine dry ingredients in a bowl.

Add remaining ingredients of your choice and stir until they are just
combined.  Bake about 20 minutes or until lightly browned and firm to
the touch. Adjust time if muffins are made smaller.

VARIATIONS, substitute for cranberry: Banana-Date - use 1 cup mashed
banana and 1/2 cup dates or raisins. If 2 bananas are not quite 1 cup,
concentrated orange juice or orange/pineapple may be added. (Tested
Jan 94 by Elizabeth Rodier, family member ate 2 warm ones.)

Apple-Raisin - 1 cup applesauce plus 1/2 cup raisins, or coarsely
chop an unpeeled apple in a food processor.

Zucchini - 1 cup grated unpeeled zucchini plus 1/2 cup raisins.

May be made as 16-18 small muffins or 9 inch square cake cut in the
desired number of pieces.  For a diabetic meal plan, reduce the
amount of sugar to 1/4 cup or 1 tsp. per serving (recommended
guideline of American Diabetes Assoc.)

This recipe is typical of healthy heart recipes with reduced sodium,
cholesterol and fat but more sugar than a typical diabetic recipe.

English Crumpets - :)

breads, muffins, british

200 gm strong white flour
2 1/2 ml salt
2 1/2 ml sugar
100 ml milk
10 ml dried yeast
1 pinch bicarb of soda
1  fat for frying

English crumpets are delicious when spread hot with butter. The butter
soaks into the crumpet and drips down your chin as you bite them:)

Strong white flour is the type bakers use for bread dough. High in
gluten in makes a good risen batter or dough. In England we have
'Crumpet Rings' which are metal, about 3" in diameter. These are
placed into a fry pan and act as moulds while the crumpet cooks.
Crumpets can be anywhere between 2" and 5" in diameter.

Sift the flour and salt into a mixing bowl.  Gently warm the milk to
just hand hot and sprinkle on the dried yeast. Leave to stand for 10
or 15 minutes until frothy. Add the yeast mix to flour and beat to a
smooth batter.  Cover with a damp cloth and leave to stand in a warm
place for 45 minutes, or the batter has doubled in size. Dissolve the
bicarb in 15ml of warm water and beat it into the batter.  Cover
again and leave to stand for a further 20 minutes.  Place a 3 inch
metal pastry cutter into a hot greased fry pan. Pour in about table
spoon of the batter to cover the base thinly. Cook until the top is
set and the bubbles have burst. Remove it from the ring, turn the
crumpet over and cook the other side for 2 or 3 minutes only. It
should just colour slightly. Cool on a wire rack. Eat them now, or
leave to go cold and toast them until brown on both sides. Spread
with lots of good butter and enjoy:) From Ron's Plaice in Blackpool:)

English Muffins 4

breads, muffins

1 cup hot water
1/2 cup scalded milk
2 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 pkg yeast
2 tablespoon 85 deg water
4 cup all-purpose flour
3 tablespoon softened butter

Remove tops and bottoms from Tuna cans and clean thoroughly to make
good muffin rings.

Combine the water, milk, sugar and salt. Dissolve the yeast in the 85
deg water for 10 min. and add. Sift and beat in two cups of flour.
Cover bowl with a damp towel and let the sponge rise for about 1 1/2
hours or until the sponge collapses. Beat the butter in and knead in
the remaining flour. Let the dough rise again until it doubles. Punch
down and 1/2 fill the rings with dough. Let rise until doubled again.
Cook until browned on a med hot well buttered griddle, turning once.
Cool slightly on a rack and serve. They are best fresh and warm.

For whole wheat muffins replace 2 cups of white flour with brown and
use brown sugar not white. Raisins and cinnamon are a nice addition
to the dough. Submitted By WA6AWD@WOLFENET.COM (ALAN BURGSTAHLER) On

English Muffins From Scratch

breads, muffins

1 lb strong white flour
1/2 oz fresh yeast or 1/2 t. dried yeast
1 tablespoon sugar
1/8 lb butter, melted
1 tablespoon salt
8 oz warm milk and water

(The 8 oz. milk and water refers to 8 fluid ounces, or 250 ml.) Sift
the flour and the salt into a bowl and leave it in a warm place.
Dissolve the yeast and sugar in 1/4 UK pint (about 1/2 cup--rsc) of
the warm milk and water.  Leave to froth, then mix in the fat.  Stir
all the liquid into the warm flour and beat well until smooth and
elastic. Cover and prove in a warm place for 50 minutes or until
doubled in bulk. Turn onto a well-floured board and knead, working in
a little more flour if necessary to make the dough easier to shape.
Round up the dough, roll into a thick sausage-shape, and divide into
8 to 10 portions about 1 1/2 to 1-3/4 inches thick. Shape each one
into a round with straight sides. Put onto a greased baking sheet,
cover and put in a warm place to prove for 30-40 minutes or until
spongy to the touch. Leave plenty of room for expansion, and be
careful not to over-prove, as the muffins will lose their shape. Warm
and grease bakestone (or other griddle) lightly. Lift the muffins
carefully onto the bakestone and cook over very moderate heat for
8-10 minutes, until pale gold underneath. Turn and cook the other
side. Wrap in a cloth and keep warm if cooking in batches.  To serve,
insert a knife in the side; then with fingers pull the top and bottom
apart and insert thin slivers of butter.  (or tear in half with forks
and toast.)  If reheating from cold, toast the top and bottom, then
pull apart and butter. Source: Diane Duane, FidoNet Cooking Echo

Glazed Orange Muffins

breads, fruits, muffins

1  vegetable cooking spray
2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
3/4 cup sugar
2 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 large orange
1/4 cup milk; or more as needed
1/3 cup butter; melted and cooled
1 large egg; lightly beaten
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup pecans; coarsely chopped and toas
      ----ORANGE GLAZE----
1  orange; finely grated zest of
1/3 cup fresh orange juice
1/3 cup sugar

Preheat the oven to 400øF. Spray 12 muffin cups with vegetable cooking
spray or line with paper liners. In a large mixing bowl, combine the
flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Grate the zest of the orange
and juice it. Add enough milk to the orange juice to measure 1 cup
plus 2 tb and pour it into a second bowl. Add the butter, egg,
vanilla, and baking soda and whisk until blended. Add the wet
ingredients to the dry and combine with as few strokes as possible.
Fold in the orange zest and pecans.

Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each one 1/2
to 2/3 full. Bake until golden and fragrant, 15-20 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the orange glaze: In a small pan, bring the orange
zest and juice and sugar to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar.
Turn down the heat and let simmer until thickened, 4-5 minutes. Let
cool slightly. The glaze should be liquidy so that it soaks into the
muffins. Let muffins cool 2-3 minutes, then brush the tops with the
warm glaze, or drip it over them with a spoon. Serve warm. Sticky and
good -- real good!

Good Enough For Grandma Apple-Streusel Muffin

main dish, muffins, picnic

1 1/2 cup flour, all purpose
1 cup sugar
2 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoon cinnamon, ground

1/3 cup brown sugar, packed
1 teaspoon cinnamon, ground
1/4 cup butter or margarine

My grandma never made these muffins, but she could have, relates John
T. Ham, Jr., of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. "They're good, old-fashioned
grandma quality.  Serve them any time of the year, but take along
some for a breakfast picnic.  Or wait till a picnic draws close and
bring them out as an end-of-the-day treat."  At least four
generations of John's clan have rated Devil's Backbone State Park
near Strawberry Point, Iowa, their top picnic spot.

1.  In a large bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 cup sugar, baking
powder,
2 teaspoons cinnamon, baking soda, and cloves. Stir in apple and
walnuts.

2.  Combine eggs, buttermilk, and melted butter.  Add flour to the
mixture.  Stir till just combined.  Spoon batter into greased
muffin
cups or pans lined with paper bake cups.

3.  For Streusel topping, in a small bowl, stir together the 1/2 cup
flour, the brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Stir in softened
butter.  Sprinkle over batter in muffin cups.

4.  Bake in a 400 degree oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Serve warm.

Hot Apple Muffins TOPPING: To prepare the topping, core and peel the
apples, keeping them whole. Cut each one into 4 to 5 thick rings. Mix
the sugar and cinnamon together and coat the apple rings. Reserve.

MUFFIN: Sift together the dry ingredients in a mixing bowl. In
another bowl beat the eggs, add the milk and melted butter. Stir the
liquid very quickly into the flour mixture - do not beat and do not
worry about lumps. Speed is essential. Fold in the chopped apples.
Fill 24 (5in.) greased muffins tins or paper cases, filled to
one-third, and put one cinnamon apple ring on each muffin.

Bake in a preheated hot oven 425F, for 15 to 25 minutes, until cooked.

Lemon Slice Muffins

breads, muffins

3  lemons
1 tablespoon water
1/2 cup sugar, or more, if needed
6 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 cup flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2  eggs
1 cup milk

Preheat oven to 400øF.  Butter standard size muffin tins. Finely
grate the zest from the lemons, removing only the bright yellow
portion of the peel. Set the lemons aside. Combine the zest, the
water and 1/4 cup of the sugar in a small saucepan.  Stir over medium
heat for about 2 minutes, just until the sugar dissolves. Add the
butter and stir until melted, about 1 minute longer.  Set aside. With
a sharp knife remove and discard all the remaining peel from the
lemons. Cut the lemons crosswise into slices about 1/4 inch thick;
discard any seeds.  You will need about 12 nicely shaped slices. Put
about 1 teaspoon of the remaining sugar in the bottom of each
prepared muffin cup and place a lemon slice on top. In a medium bowl,
stir and toss together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and
salt. Set aside. In a larger bowl whisk together the eggs, milk and
the reserved lemon mixture until smooth.  Add the combined dry
ingredients and stir just until blended. Spoon into the tins, filling
about 3/4 full. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean, 15 - 20
minutes. Immediately invert the tins; the muffins should fall out. If
they resist, nudge them with a knife. * Makes about 12 standard

stir to combine. Stir in the chocolate chips. In a separate bowl,
combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Make a well
in the center of the flour mixture and pour the wet ingredients into
the well. Stir until just blended. The batter will be lumpy. Pour the
batter evenly into the two 8-cup muffin pans that have been well
greased or lined with paper muffin cups. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or
until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean.
This is a light-colored muffin so be careful not to overbake. Let the
muffins cool in the pan for 2-3 minutes, then carefully remove and
place on a wire rack to cool.

NOTE: You can substitute two 4-oz jars of banana baby food (such as
Gerber) for the applesauce and use just 1 ripe banana. Or try other
baby food fruits such as pineapple, apple or plum.

Mary Jo's English Muffins

breads, muffins

2 tablespoon dry yeast
3 cup warm water
2 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup dry milk
8 cup flour, divided
6 tablespoon vegetable oil

In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the water. Add the sugar, salt
and dry milk and bland. Add half the flour and whisk for 1 minute.
Set the mixture aside for 1 hour, or until the sponge falls back on
itself. Beat in the oil. Add the remaining flour and mix well. Add
extra flour if necessary to make a fairly stiff dough.

With floured hands cut out about 20 four-ounce pieces of dough and
form them into 3-inch patties. Place the patties on a greased cookie
sheet and let rise about half and hour, or until they are doubled in
bulk.

Preheat griddle to 325 to 350 F and cook approximately
7    minutes per side.

For Cinnamon-Raisin English Muffins: Add 1 tbs. cinnamon and 1 cup
raisins with the remaining flour.

For whole wheat English muffins: Substitute "crunchy whole wheat
flour mix" for white flour:

:           2 cups whole wheat flour
:           2 cups cracked wheat flour
:           4 cups unbleached white flour

effectively coated.

In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg and cinnamon. In
another bowl combine thoroughly oil, sugar, egg and milk

Add liquid ingredients to dry and stir only to combine.

Bake 350 for 20-25 min.

door to check! The 'Pfitzauf' gets dusted with sugar and is served
with stewed fruit.

substitute a muffin pan lined with paper cupcake holders. The same
recipe specifies 400 degrees F. K.B.))

Pineapple Muffin Cookies

cookies, muffins

1 cup shortening
1 1/2 cup sugar
1  egg
1 cup crushed pineapple with juice
3 1/2 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 cup walnuts, chopped

A last minute substitute gave a new twist to an old Amish recipe for
raisin cookies. The cupboard was bare so leftover pineapple was
substituted for the raisins. Everyone preferred the pineapple
version. (Editor's Note: We called these Pineapple Muffins Cookies,
because they came out big and soft.)

Preheat oven to 350ø.

In a large mixing bowl, cream shortening, sugar and egg. When light
and fluffy, stir in crushed pineapple with juice.

Sift flour, baking soda, salt and nutmeg together and stir into
batter. When the mixture is well blended, stir in nuts.

Drop by teaspoonfuls 2 inches apart on greased baking sheets. Bake
at 350ø for 8-10 minutes. Cool on wire racks.

breads, muffins, breakfast

1/2 cup almonds; unblanched/sliced
1 3/4 cup flour
1 cup sugar
1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
1 cup pumpkin,plain
1/2 cup butter; melted
6 oz chocolate chips

Heat oven to 350-deg.  Put almonds on baking sheet or pie pan and
bake about 5 minutes, just until lightly browned; watch carefully so
almonds don't burn.  (You can also toast them in toaster oven.)
Slice almonds off the baking sheet so they cool quickly.
Grease muffin cups or use foil or paper baking cups.  Thoroughly
mix the flour, sugar, pie spice, baking soda, baking powder and salt
in a large bowl.  Break eggs in another bowl.  Add pumpkin and butter
and whisk until well-blended.  Stir in chocolate chips and almonds.
Pour over dry ingredients and fold in with a rubber spatula until dry
ingredients are just moistened.  Scoop batter evenly into muffin
cups.  Bake 20-25 minutes or until puffed and springy to the touch in
the center.  Turn out onto a rack to cool.  Wrap in plastic or foil
when cool.  Make 1 or 2 days ahead for best flavor.  May reheat
before serving.  Yields 12 regular or 6 giant muffins.

Quick Corn Bread 1

3 teaspoon baking powder
1 tablespoon honey
1 1/2 cup water; warm
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

and warm water together, then add to dry ingredients, stirring just
until mixed. Pour into lightly oiled or non-stick 8-inch square
baking dish. Bake at 375 degrees for 20 minutes.

HELPFUL HINTS: Various spices may be added for different flavors.
Pieces of finely chopped or grated vegetables also may be added. Try
finely chopped onion, finely chopped green pepper, chopped green
chilis, chopped pimiento, grated carrots, grated zucchini. Used alone
or in various combinations, they add special appeal to this simple,
tasty corn bread. If you have a nonstick baking pan, it is not
necessary to oil it first. This recipe also may be used for muffins.

Sm  Muffins/Biscuits

muffins

9 cup flour; sifted
1/3 cup baking powder; double acting
1 cup nonfat dry milk plus
2 tablespoon nonfat dry milk
4 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cup vegetable shortening

Stir baking powder, dry milk and salt into the sifted flour. Sift all
dry ingredients together until well mixed. Cut or mix fat into flour
mixture utnil all particles are thouroughly coated and mixture
esembels coarse cornmeal. Sotre mix in a jar or can with a tight lid.
It can be measured into 2 cup amounts and put in plastic bags or
jarsd where it will be ready for use. It may be stored at room
temperature for 6 weeks. Vary the liquids: dry milk solids are
already in the mix so more milk is not need. You can use fruit juice,
water or meat broth for the liquid called for in a recipe.

The recipes in this Pick-A-pocket book were writted for commercial
packaged baking mix which has no milk so it is the liquid called for
in recipes. This mix is a perfect substitte. Just use water where it
calls for milk. (written out of my cookbook)

Basic biscuits: 2 cups mix, 1/2 cup water. Add water to mix and stir
20-25 times. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 10-15
times. Roll to 1/2" thickness and cut with a knife to pockets shapes
or use biscuit cutter to make circles. Place in preheated sm and bake
5 minutes or until golden brown.

Sausage biscuits: 2 1/4 cups packaged biscuit baking mix(milk), 8
links sausages cooked.

Prepare biscuits according to package directions for rolled biscuits.
Knead dough, roll out on floured surface and cut 8 circles with a
biscuit cutter. Lay one sausage in center of each and wrap dough
around, pinching to seal. Sausages will stick out the ends. Bake 5
minutes or until golden brown.

Jelly biscuits: flatten unbaked biscuits with heel of your hand.
Place 1/2 teaspoon jelly or preserves in center. Fold over and pinch
edges together to seal. Bake 5 minutes or till golden.

muffins

1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/4 cup light brown sugar, packed
1 large egg, beaten lightly
1 cup sour cream
1/4 cup dark molasses
1/2 cup raisins
1 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup miller's bran

a Gourmet Magazine favorite from 1981

This is the Rolls-Royce of bran muffin recipes.

In a large bowl with an electric mixer cream together the butter and
the brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy, beat in the
egg, the sour cream, and the molasses, and stir in the raisins. In a
bowl whisk together the flour, the baking soda, the salt, and the
bran, add the mixture to the sour cream mixture, and stir the batter
until it is just combined. (The batter will be lumpy.) Spoon the
batter into 12 well-buttered 1/3-cup muffin tins and bake the muffins
in the middle of a preheated 400 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or
until they are golden brown and springy to the touch. Turn the
muffins out onto a rack and let them cool.

(Miller's bran is available at natural foods stores, specialty foods
shops, and some supermarkets)
