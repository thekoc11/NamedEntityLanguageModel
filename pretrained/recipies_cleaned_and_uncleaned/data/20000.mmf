      Title: CRUNCHY CHINESE NOODLES
 Categories: Pasta
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
    125 g  Egg noodles
      2 tb Dark sesame oil
      1    2.5cm piece of Root ginger
           -- finely grated
      1    Garlic clove; crushed
      2 tb Soy sauce
      3    Spring onions
           -- finely sliced
     25 g  Pine nuts
           -- browned under the grill
           Fresh coriander leaves
           -- to garnish
 
  The crunch of browned pine nuts gives this simple mixture of egg
  noodles, garlic and ginger a mouth-watering texture. The dish is made
  in a matter of moments, and a finishing touch of fresh coriander
  makes all the difference, adding its distinctively oriental flavour.
  
  Cook the egg noodles in boiling, salted water until soft - about 4-5
  minutes. Heat the oil in a wok and soften the ginger and garlic
  gently in it for 3-4 minutes, then toss in the noodles until well
  coated. Stir in the soy sauce and spring onions and cook for another
  3-4 minutes. Finally stir in the pine nuts and mix thoroughly. Serve
  immediately, garnished with fresh coriander leaves.

  Souce: Woman's Weekly (no idea about date). Entered by Anja Wolle June
  1996.
  
  Comments(Anja): this is a lovely cake, but the sugar for the topping
  is too much, and I think it might turn out better if you used caster
  (superfine) sugar. I also used about twice as much lemon juice (4
  tb), to achieve a good coverage.

 Categories: Biscuits
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 c  Uncooked Quick Oats
      1 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Baking soda
    1/2 ts Salt (optional)
      1 c  Packed brown sugar
    1/2 c  White granulated sugar
    3/4 c  Shortening
      1    Egg
      1 ts Vanilla extract
    1/4 c  Molasses
 
  raisins, nuts, chocolate chips, birdseed, etc.
  
  Preheat oven to 350 F
  
  Mix dry ingredients.  Cream together sugars, shortening, vanilla,
  molasses. Mix in dry ingredients until mixed. Add "extras" --
  raisins, nuts, chips, etc. (I like pecans and chocolate chips). Roll
  tablespoons of the batter into little balls (the molasses will make a
  mess out of your hands -- I have to wash them a few times) about 3/4"
  or 1" in diameter; place on a greased cookie sheet. Press them down
  with your fingers to flatten them, and put them in the oven for 11-13
  minutes. If you bake them at a bit lower than 350 you can do it
  longer and they get more crispy. Remove from oven and let sit for a
  minute or two so they don't fall apart when you cool them on a wire
  rack.
  
  Enjoy!

      Title: CRUNCHY SNACKS FOR KIDS
 Categories: Kids, Snacks
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
    1/2 c  (8 tbsp) honey
    1/2 c  Margarine
      6 c  POPPED popcorn
      1 c  Shelled peants
 
  From: Vicki Lansky's CANDY book
  
  COOKIE JAR
  
  Have you thought of putting crackers in your cookie jar? They are
  made with less sugar and you can choose a low salt variety. You can
  fill a cookie jar with peanuts-in-th-shell or roasted no-salt nuts.
  Or keep on hand a jar of nuts and raisins with a few chocolate chips
  thrown in (aka "gorp").
  
  POPCORN
  
  Try sprinkling grated Parmesan cheese or American cheese on popcorn.
  Or, mix with peanuts, or cinnamon.
  
  Package extra popcorn in small plastic bags with twist ties -
  excellent for an out-of-doors treat, car ride (Donna's note: UGH!) or
  TV special snack. (Donna's note: lunch boxes!)
  
  HONEY "CRACKER JACKS"
  
  Heat honey and butter in a saucepan until blended. Cool. Pour over
  popcorn which has been mixed with peanuts, stirring as you pour. When
  well-coated, spread in a pan in a single layer. Bake at 350 for 5 -
  10 minutes or until crisp, stirring several times. The difference
  between crisp (not brown) and burnt can be a matter of minutes.
  Package in plastic bags and twist tie. If you want it to be mistaken
  for the "real thing", add a small toy.
  
  POPCORN CANDY CLUSTERS
  
  1 cup (8 oz) semi-sweet chocolate chips 1 cup freshly popped popcorn
  1 cup nuts
  
  Melt chocolate chips. Add popcorn and nuts and stir until they are
  well coated. Drop by spoonfuls onto a cookie sheet or wax paper and
  let set til firm. If the crowd is rushing you for a taste, chill the
  clusters in the freezer for 5 minutes. When firm, store in plastic
  bags.
  
  CRUNCHO MIX
  
  Mix: 4 cups crunchy cereal (Cheerios, or Corn Chex, etc) 1 cup
  peanuts or mixed nuts 1 cup pretzel sticks, the smallest size 1 cup
  seasoned croutons
  
  Combine: 1/2 cup salad oil or 6 tbsp melted butter 2 tsp
  Worcestershire Sauce 1/4 tsp garlic powder
  
  In a shallow pan coat crunchy ingredients with the combined oil and
  seasonings. Heat in oven at 250 for about 45 minutes, stirring every
  15 minutes. Spread on absorbent paper to cool.

  2 1/4 lb Red chillis
      3 ts Salt
 
  The ulek-ulek is the implement you use to crush candlenuts, chillis,
  etcetera in a cobek. Sambal Ulek is made of chillis that have been
  crushed this way. This is a very basic sambal, which is useful to
  keep in quantity, so that you can use it for quite a lot of recipes
  which specify red chillis as one of the ingredients. As this sambal
  can be stored for at least 2 weeks in the refrigerator, it is worth
  while making quite a lot of it. But to crush the chillis in a cobek
  with the ulek-ulek is very laborious. A food processor is a great
  help here.
  
  Seed and chop the red chillis roughly, then put all these into a
  saucepan and half-fill the saucepan with boiling water. Boil the
  chillis for 8 minutes. Drain, and put them into the food processor,
  using the blade for mincing meat. Let the machine run for a minute or
  so. For Sambal Ulek you don't want the chilli paste to be too smooth.
  Put this sambal into a jar, stir in the salt, cover the jar tightly
  and keep in the refrigerator.

  pints. A bushel weighs 53 pounds and yields 17 to 20 quarts of
  crushed tomatoes--an average of 2-3/4 pounds per quart.
  
  Procedure: Wash tomatoes and dip in boiling water for 30 to 60
  seconds or until skins split. Then dip in cold water slip off skins,
  and remove cores. Trim off any bruised or discolored portions and
  quarter. Heat one-sixth of the quarters quickly in a large pot,
  crushing them with a wooden mallet or spoon as they are added to the
  pot. This will exude juice. Continue heating the tomatoes, stirring
  to prevent burning. Once the tomatoes are boiling, gradually add
  remaining quartered tomatoes, stirring constantly These remaining
  tomatoes do not need to be crushed. They will soften with heating and
  stirring. Continue until all tomatoes are added. Then boil gently 5
  minutes. Add bottled lemon juice or citric acid to jars (See
  acidification directions). Add 1 teaspoon of salt per quart to the
  jars, if desired. Fill jars immediately with hot tomatoes, leaving
  1/2-inch headspace. Adjust lids and process. Recommended process
  times are given in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.

      Title: CRUSTADE OF CHICKEN & PIGEON
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
     12 oz Wholewheat pastry
      1    Pigeon
      2    Chicken breasts
           Or whole legs
    2/3 c  Dry white wine
           -several grinds of black
           -pepper
      4    Cloves
    1/2 oz Butter
      2 oz Mushrooms, roughly chopped
      1 oz Raisins
      3 lg Eggs
           -salt
           -pepper
    1/2 ts Ground ginger
 
  Roll out 8 oz of the pastry and line a 8 inch flan dish; back the
  crust blind. Put the pigeon in a pot with the stock, wine, pepper and
  cloves and cook very slowly for an hour. Add the chicken and continue
  to cook for a further 45 minutes or till the meat of both birds is
  really tender. Meanwhile cook the mushrooms lightly in the butter.
  Remove the birds from the stock and bone them. Cut the flesh into
  quite small pieces, mix it with the mushrooms and the raisins and
  spread them over the base of the flan case. Beat the eggs with a fork
  and season with the salt, pepper, and ginger. Add 1 cup of the
  cooking juices and pour over the meat in the flan case. If you want
  to have a lid, roll out the rest of the pastry and cover the flan.
  Bake it in moderate oven (350 F) for 25 minutes if uncovered, 35
  minutes if covered. Serve warm with a good green salad. For a more
  20th century flavor-- double the chicken, leave out the pigeon, and
  substitute 1 oz chopped fried bacon for the raisins.

      1 pk Active dry yeast; or
      1 ts Active dry yeast; bulk
    1/4 c  Water; warm, 110-115 deg. f.
      1 c  Cottage cheese; *
      1 ts Sugar
  1 1/4 ts Salt
      1 ea Egg; lg.
  2 1/4 c  Unbleached flour; unsifted,*
      1 ts Butter; room temperature
      1 c  Cheddar; sharp, grated
 
  *  The cottage cheese should be the small curd kind at room
  temperature. ** You can use up to an extra 1/4 cup of flour in this
  recipe depending on the weather.
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  ++++++++++++++ ++++ Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let
  stand 5 minutes. Gently stir to completely dissolve. With an electric
  mixer, blend the softened yeast into the cottage cheese, sugar, salt
  and egg. Add the flour in 1/2 cup portions to form a stiff but light
  dough and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk. Butter a 1
  1/2 quart casserole dish and stir the dough down, then add 1 cup of
  the grated cheddar cheese. Turn into the buttered dish. Let rise 30
  to 40 minutes longer or until almost doubled in size.  Preheat the
  oven to 350 degrees F. and bake for 40 to 50 minutes or until golden
  brown. Brush the top with butter.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 c  Flour
      1 c  Corn Meal
      1 ts Salt
      2 tb Sugar
      1 tb Baking Powder
      1    Egg, lightly beaten
      1 c  Milk
    1/4 c  Cooking Oil
 
  Combine the dry ingredients. Combine the egg with the milk and oil.
  Stir into the mixture, mixing until *just* moistened. Pour the
  mixture into a preheated, lightly oiled, iron skillet until a little
  more than half full. Preheat the skillet by putting it into the oven
  when the oven is turned on for preheating. Gives a very crusty
  cornbread with the top not cooked as dark as the sides and bottom.
  Bake at 425 degrees F. for maybe as much as 20 minutes.  Cool
  slightly and cut into squares, then serve warm. This is a trial and
  error deal to suit your own taste for sweetness, adjust sugar as you
  want, and crustiness.  Don't want crust all over? Then don't use
  prehotted cast iron skillet, use 8 inch or 9 inch greased pie pan
  instead. Less crust?  Experiment with preheating skillet on top of
  stove to varying degrees, choose the one you like.

      Title: CRUSTY CORN FLAT BREAD
 Categories: Breads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Brown rice flour +
           -additional for dusting
           -loaves
  1 1/2 ts Granulated yeast
      2    Tesapoons sugar
  1 1/2 c  Warm water (110F)
      1 c  Corn flour
    1/2 c  Cornstarch
      2 ts Xantham gum powder
      1    To 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
      2 lg Eggs, at room temperature
      1 tb Corn oil
 
  Here's a couple of off beat bread recipes I thought might interest
  you. This and the following recipe are wheat free breads.
  
  Combine 1/2 cup of the rice flour, the yeast, sugar and 1/2 cup of
  the warm water in a 2-cup glass measure; stir to combine, then let
  rest in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 10 minutes.
  
  Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and draw two 8-inch
  circles on it.
  
  Combine remaining 1/2 cup rice flour, corn flour, cornstarch, xanthan
  gum powder and salt in a large bowl; mix to blend.
  
  Beat eggs lightly; set aside 1 tablespoon for brushing tops of
  loaves. Add remaining 1 cup warm water and the corn oil to beaten
  eggs. Using a wooden spoon, stir egg and yeast mixtures into flour
  and beat until smooth. Using a rubber spatula, spread soft dough into
  circles on marked parchment paper, heaping it up slightly in the
  center.
  
  Cover loaves lightly with greased plastic wrap and let rise until
  doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
  
  Preheat oven to 425F.
  
  Beat a few drops of water into the reserved beaten egg and brush over
  loaves.  Dust lightly with rice flour. Using a razor blade, slash
  tops of loaves into a large diamond grid pattern. (Use an up-and-down
  cutting motion rather than dragging the blade through the soft dough.)
  
  Bake for 20 minutes, until well browned.
  
  Makes two 8-inch diameter, 11-ounce loaves.

      Title: CRUSTY COUNTRY BREAD
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
      1    Envelope dry yeast
    1/3 c  Warm water (105-115 F)
      4 c  Hard wheat white flour
      2 ts Sugar (optional)
      2 ts Salt
  1 1/4 c  Warm water (120-130 F)
 
  Makes 2 baguettes or 1 long or round loaf
  
  Lightly grease large bowl; set aside.
  
  Stir yeast into 1/3 cup water and let stand until mixture bubbles,
  about 5 to 7 minutes.  Combine with flour in mixing bowl. Begin
  beating, adding sugar, salt and remaining water, and continue beating
  until well mixed.
  
  Turn dough out onto lightly floured board and knead until smooth and
  elastic, about 5 minutes.  Place in greased bowl, turning to coat
  entire surface.  Cover with plastic wrap and hot, damp towel and let
  stand in warm place until almost tripled in volume.  When dough has
  risen, transfer to board, punch down and knead about 2 minutes to
  eliminate any air bubbles. Return to bowl, cover and let rise again
  until at least doubled.
  
  Preheat oven to 425 F.  Grease baking sheet.  On lightly floured
  board, punch dough down, roll into oval, then form into desired
  shape. Make several slashes diagonally across top with knife or
  scissors. Place on baking sheet and let rise until loaf is doubled.
  Bake 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 F and bake 5 to 10 minutes more
  for baguettes, or 15 minutes for single loaf, until golden brown and
  bread gives hollow sound when tapped on bottom. Cool on rack.

      Title: CRUSTY PERSIAN RICE WITH CINNAMON & PISTACH
 Categories: Rice, Oriental
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
  2 1/2 c  Basmati rice (18 ounces)
      2 tb Salt (plus 1/4 teaspoon)
    1/8 ts Saffron threads
      1 sm Orange
      6 tb Butter
      1 ts Sugar
    1/4 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 c  Shelled unsalted pistachios
           -(2 1/2 ounces)
    1/2 c  Golden raisins
      2 tb Vegetable oil
 
  Put rice in medium bowl with water to cover.  Drain and repeat
  procedure 5 times.  Return rice to the bowl and gently fill the bowl
  with cold running water. Keep the water running gently into the bowl
  until the liquid runs clear.  Drain, return rice to the bowl with
  water to cover, and let stand for at least 6 hours. (Can let stand at
  room temperature overnight.) Bring 4 quarts of water with 2
  tablespoons salt to boil in a soup kettle. Keep the water boiling
  while slowly adding the drained rice. Simmer for 5 minutes; rinse
  with cold running water and drain thoroughly. Remove 1 cup of rice
  and stir in the saffron threads; set aside. Put the plain rice in a
  large bowl.  Peel a 3- by 1-inch strip of zest from the orange and
  cut into 1/8-inch dice.  Bring 1 cup of water to boil in a small
  saucepan, add the zest, and simmer for 2 minutes. Drain the zest and
  pat dry. Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a small skillet and saute the
  zest for 15 seconds; add the sugar and cook for 30 seconds. Stir in
  cinnamon, pistachios, raisins, and 1/4 teaspoon salt; saute, stirring
  continuously to coat with butter-sugar mixture.  Stir zest mixture
  into the plain rice. Melt the remaining butter.  Coat the bottom and
  sides of a heavy, lidded, 3-quart saucepan (preferably cast iron)
  with 1 tablespoon of the melted butter mixed with the oil.  Heat the
  coated pan until hot. Remove from the heat and spread half of the
  zested rice over the bottom of the pan, pressing down well with a
  spoon.  Cover with a mound of the remaining zested rice. Sprinkle the
  saffron rice over the top. Use the handle of a wooden spoon to make a
  hole in the center of the rice deep enough to reach the bottom of the
  pan.  Make 2 or 3 additional holes in the rice to allow steam to
  escape. Drizzle rice with remaining 4 tablespoons of melted butter.
  Cook rice for 6 minutes over low heat, uncovered. Wrap lid in a linen
  towel, securing towel ends under or around lid handle. Cover the pot
  with the towel-wrapped lid and steam over low heat for 40 to 60
  minutes, until a crisp golden crust forms on the bottom of the rice.
  Remove pan from heat and let stand for 10 minutes. SERVING: Spoon
  soft, fluffy rice onto a platter. Break the bottom crust into pieces
  and arrange around the fluffy rice.  Serve immediately

      Title: CRUSTY ROLLS (EW)
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 16 Rolls
 
      1 ts Malt extract or brown sugar
      1 pk Active dry yeast
  5 1/2 c  (approx) bread flour or
           -unbleached all-purpose
           -flour
    1/4 c  Nonfat dry milk
      1 tb Salt
           Cornmeal for dusting baking
           -sheets
 
  In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 1/2 cups lukewarm water and malt
  extract or brown sugar; sprinkle yeast on top and let stand until the
  yeast is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Gradually stir in 3 cups of the
  flour, stirring in the same direction for 3 minutes. Stir in nonfat
  drymilk and salt. Then gradually add more of the remaining flour
  until the dough becomes too difficult to stir.
  
  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, gradually
  incorporating more flour as needed to prevent sticking, until smooth
  and elastic, about 10 minutes. (Alternatively, the dough can be
  kneaded in a stand-up mixer fitted with a dough hook).
  
  Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turn to coat and cover with
  plastic wrap.  Let rise until almost tripled in volume, 2 1/2 to 3
  hours. Punch dough down; cover and let rise until doubled, about 1
  1/2 hours. (Or, you can let the dough rise for the second time
  overnight in the refrigerator.)
  
  Lightly oil 2 baking sheets or spray with nonstick cooking spray;
  sprinkle with cornmeal.  Punch the dough down, turn out onto a
  lightly floured surface and knead into a smooth ball. Divide the
  dough into 16 portions. Shape each portion into a ball, then roll to
  make a slight oval. As you work, keep any dough that you are not
  using covered. Place the rolls at least 2 inches apart on the
  prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle rolls with flour and rub gently over
  the surfaces. Cover with a dry tea towel and let rise until almost
  doubled, about 1 hour.
  
  Thirty minutes before baking, place a baking stone or an inverted
  baking sheet on the center rack of a cold oven. Place a metal cake
  pan on the bottom rack; preheat to 425 F. Just before baking, pour 1
  cup water into the cake pan.  Working with one batch at a time, cut a
  1/4 inch deep slash with a serrated knife along the top of each roll.
  Place the baking sheet on the baking stone or until the rolls are
  golden brown and bottoms sound hollow when tapped.  Transfer to a
  wire rack and let cool. Add more water to the cake pan, slash the
  remaining rolls and bake them in the same manner. (The cooled rolls
  can be stored in a plastic bag in the freezer for up to 3 months.  To
  serve, arrange the frozen rolls on a baking sheet and heat in a 350F
  oven for 10 to 15 minutes.

    1/2 c  Bread flour
           Oil and cornmeal for pan
 
  These baguettes are crusty, deep brown and dusted with flour. The
  dough can also be shaped into a round and backed on a pizza pan,
  preferably black steel. Slash the loaves with a sharp knife or with
  the metal blade of a food processor (hold it carefully by the center
  hub); deep slashes make a great-looking baguette.
  
  Basic Sponge
  
  In processor fitted with metal blade, Mix Basic Sponge with water,
  salt, and honey until smooth. Combine flours. (If processor is
  standard- size remove half of sponge mixture and add flours in two
  batches.) Add combines flours, 1/4 cup at a time, pulsing several
  times to incorporate each addition. Then process dough until supple,
  elastic and sticking slightly to work bowl, about 1 minute, adding
  more water or flour by teaspoon, if dough is either too dry or too
  wet. Dough should be very sticky.
  
  Transfer dough to large plastic bag, squeeze out all air and seal
  tightly at top of bag to allow enough room for dough to expand. Set
  bag in bowl and let dough rise in warm spot until doubled, about 1
  hour.
  
  Oil double baguette bread pan. Sprinkle bottom lightly with cornmeal.
  Punch dough down, place on generously floured surface and divide in
  half. Pat each piece into rectangle. Start on long side to roll up
  dough. Pinch seams to seal. Gently stretch to fit pan, if necessary.
  Place dough seam side down, in pan. Sprinkle flour lightly over top.
  Cover loosely with plastic. (Can be refrigerated at this point for
  several hours. Remove from refrigerator about 1 1/2 hours before
  baking.) Let dough rise in warm spot until doubled, about 50 minutes
  or longer if previously refrigerated. Slash surface.

      2 ts Cumin
      2 ts Salt

  Stem, seed, and dice peppers.  [Scotch Bonnets can be substituted for
  the Habaneros.]  Dice onions and tomatoes. Mix in all other
  ingredients and chill (overnight is best) until the flavors blend.
  
  Serve with tortilla chips.  Not for the heat intolerant! WARNING: You
  may want to use gloves to handle the peppers, ESPECIALLY the
  Habaneros.
  
  * Hot Pepper Vinegar:
  
  A home-bottled, *HOT* pepper vinegar is the best choice. If that is
  not available, a commercially bottled vinegar can be substituted. You
  can, however, easily bottle your own pepper vinegar to control the
  heat and flavor content.
  
  [See recipe] Dat'l Do-It Hot Pepper Vinegar is also great substitute.
  However, it comes in very small bottles. Since we were continually
  "topping it off," we decided to mix it in quantity. Add seven bottles
  of Dat'l vinegar, peppers and all, to approximately 3/4 gallon of
  white vinegar, and allow to steep for a week before using. The
  quantities specified are actually more diluted than the original
  product, so you may choose to use the original formula directly.

  It's worth while making this dish for friends on a special occasion-
  it takes a little time to prepare, but every mouthful justifies the
  effort!
  
  Cook the spinach in its own water for 2-3 minutes, until the leaves
  are soft. Drain, squeeze dry and chop it. In a bowl combine it well
  with the Ricotta, 2 tbs of the Parmesan, the eggs, and the nutmeg,
  salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Spread about 3 tbs of the mixture on each crpe, put a strip of the
  Fontina across the centre, and roll up the crpes to enclose the
  filling. Arrange them seam side down in one layer in a buttered
  gratin dish. Sprinkle the remaining Parmesan over the crpes and bake
  in the middle of a preheated oven at 220 degrees C / 425 degrees F /
  gas 7 for 15-20 minutes, or until they are puffed and golden.

  The Cholesterol-Saturated Fat Index: "In order to make it easier for
  people to select foods that are low in BOTH cholesterol and saturated
  fats, we have devised a Cholesterol-Saturated FAt Index(CSI). The CSI
  enables you to grasp the contribution of both saturated fat AND
  cholesterol in one food compared to another. The CSI reflects our
  findings that the amount of saturated fat in the diet is just as
  important as the amount of cholesterol in terms of dietary control of
  the cholesterol and LDL in the blood.
      The lower the CSI number, the better the food choice for the
  prevention of heart disease(and the other disorders.....).

      Title: CTOPUS WITH GARLIC - POLIPI VERACI ALL'AGLIO
 Categories: Octopus, Italian
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2    Octopus (about 1 1/2 pounds
           -each)
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      5    Cloves garlic, crushed
      1    Bay leaf
    1/2 ts Cumin seeds
           Salt
      1 sm Green pepper, chopped
 
  rosemary leaves and parsley
  
  Cut out the eyes and mouth of the octopus. Remove the ink sac and
  internal bone. Cut off the tough points in the tentacles. Put each
  octopus on a board and beat them well to break the fibers and make
  the meat more tender. Wash them in running water until they are very
  white; do not dry but put them in an earthen- ware dish and season
  with oil, flavored with garlic, bay leaf and cumin seeds. Cover the
  dish tightly with a sheet of waxed paper or foil tied around the top
  with string. Put the dish over a very low heat between 1 and 2 hours,
  according to the size of the octopus. When they are tender, drain
  them, season with additional oil, salt, green pepper, rosemary leaves
  and parsley. Serve in a tureen.

  It doesn't make reference to it in the text, but in the pictures of
  both these dishes, it shows one or two largish octopi garnished with
  reseattes of baby octopi tentacles. I imagine you'd do quite well
  using the 'baby' octopi like those I see sold around here in the
  supermarkets, or even with squid.

      Title: CUBAN (PUERTO RICAN) BEANS
 Categories: Legumes, Caribbean
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Beans, dried
      1    Onion, diced
    1/4    Green pepper, diced
      3    Garlic cloves, diced
      8 oz Tomato sauce
      2 tb Olive oil
      2 ts Salt  (You can
           -vary the amount
           -of salt according to
           -preference.  My mother
           -uses about 1 T )

MMMMM---------------------RICE TO GO WITH IT--------------------------
      1 ts Salt (You can
           -vary the amount of salt
           -according to preference)
      2 c  Water
      1 c  Rice, long-grain
 
  PREPARE BEANS:  Soak the beans for at least two hours (overnight is
  okay too). Change the water and bring to a boil. Add the onion,
  pepper and garlic; cover and simmer for 1 hour.
  
  Add the tomato sauce, olive oil and salt:  cover and simmer 1 more
  hour. (Be sure to keep the beans covered with liquid, adding more
  water if necessary.)
  
  PREPARE RICE:  Bring the water to a boil.  Add the rice and salt.
  Cover and let simmer for 20 minutes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Beans like they cook in many Caribbean countries -- This recipe is
  from my mother, who undoubtedly got it from one of my father's
  relatives. I've seen it described as being from various countries,
  but it will always be Puerto Rican beans to me.
  
  Any dried beans can be used, but kidney beans and navy beans are the
  best. Chick peas aren't bad either.  You can use a ham bone for
  flavoring instead of the olive oil if you don't mind using ham.
  Yield: Serves 4.
  
  *  This makes a very good main course or side dish.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  2 hours soaking, 5 minutes dicing, 2 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  the rice is the only part you need to measure.

  boiling chicken broth, and immediately break the egg into the soup.
  It will cook in 2 to 3 minutes.  Add salt and pepper, and sprinkle

    1/3 c  Apricot preserves
    1/4 c  Dark rum
      1 ts Instant espresso coffee
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ground cloves

MMMMM---------------------------DOUGH--------------------------------
  3 1/3 c  Flour
      1 c  Sugar
      1 ts Baking powder
     12 tb Lard or butter
      2    Eggs
    1/3 c  Milk

MMMMM------------------EGG WASH FOR ASSEMBLING-----------------------
      1    Egg
      1 pn Salt
           Confectioners' sugar
 
  The name of these filled pastries is Cucidati, which is Sicilian for
  Buccellati, or "little bracelets." FOR THE FILLING: Stem the figs and
  quarter them. Place in a bowl and cover with boiling water; steep 10
  minutes. Drain and chop coarsely in the food processor. Combine with
  remaining ingredients. To prepare in advance, cover tightly with
  plastic wrap and keep at a cool room temperature or in the
  refrigerator up to 3 days. FOR THE DOUGH: Combine the flour, sugar
  and baking powder in a bowl and stir to mix. Rub in the lard or
  butter finely, leaving the mixture powdery. Beat the eggs and milk to
  combine in a small bowl and stir into the flour mixture to form a
  dough. Turn the dough out on a lightly floured surface and knead
  lightly a few times. Wrap the dough in plastic and chill. Divide the
  dough into 12 pieces and roll each into a cylinder about 12 inches
  long. Flour the surface and the dough lightly and roll it into a
  rectangle about 14 inches long and 3 inches wide. Place a line of the
  filling down the center of each rectangle, using 1/12 of the filling
  for each piece of dough. Bring up the dough around the filling and
  pinch to seal. Turn the filled sausage of dough over so that the seam
  is on the bottom and cut it into 3 1/2- to 4-inch lengths. Using a
  sharp paring knife or single-edge razor blade, make a series of
  diagonal slashes in the top of each little sausage. Pull and twist
  gently, holding the sausage at each end to open the slashes. Transfer
  the Cucidati as they are formed to paper- lined cookie sheets,
  curving them into wide horseshoe shapes. Make an egg wash by beating
  the egg and salt together with a fork until it is loose. Paint each
  shape with the egg wash. Bake the Cucidati in a preheated 350F oven
  about 20 minutes, or until they are a light golden color. Cool, dust
  with confectioners' sugar and store the Cucidati in tins, between
  layers of wax paper.

 Categories: Indian, Salads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  Got some cucumbers languishing in the fridge? Probably won't be after
  you see the next four posts...
  
  Raitas or yoghurt salads provide a cool and refreshing contrast to hot
  curries in an Indian meal.  However, raitas like this one can also be
  used as a dip for crudites or as a light lunch served with naan or
  paratha breads.
  
  Peel 500 g cucumber and halve lengthwise. out the seeds and slice the
  cucumber finely, about 3 mm thick.
  
  Have ready a large pot of boiling water and bowl of ice-cold water.
  Drop the cucumber to the boiling water for 2 minutes, then scoop out
  and into the cold water. (Using a deep-fry basket makes this easier.)
  Drain the cucumber and dry it thoroughly.
  
  In a bowl, mix 500 mL yoghurt (low fat can used), salt to taste, 1
  tablespoon finely chopped parsley, 2 tablespoons of finely chopped
  dill, 2 tablespoons of toasted and chopped walnuts or pecan nuts, 1/3
  cup of grated fresh coconut (or use dried shredded coconut pre
  moistened with about one and a tablespoons of boiling water) and 1
  hot chopped finely.
  
  When well blended, stir in the the cucumber.
  
  Heat a tablespoon of oil in a small pan, then add two teaspoons of
  black mustard seeds.  When the mustard seeds sizzle and turn grey,
  tip seeds and oil into the cucumber mixture and stir well.
  Refrigerate for an hour or so to allow the flavours to blend.
  
  Makes 5 or 6 servings.

  remove the seeds by cutting a channel in the cucumber lengthwise down
  the center of both halves, three quarters of an inch wide and equally
  deep. Discard seeds.
  
  Crush the garlic.  Pulverize the pine nuts in a blender, mini-food
  processor, or motar and pestle.  In a small bowl, mix the garlic, pine
  nuts, basil leaves, and salt.
  
  Mash the avocado with a fork and pass through a sieve to pur e. Add
  the lemon juice and garlic-pine nut paste and mix well.
  
  Fill the channels evenly with the pesto.  Garnish with olive slices
  and a single line of pimentos running down the center of each channel.

 Categories: Korean, Salads, Vegetables, Ethnic
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      3 ea Cucumbers
      1 tb Salt
      1 ea Clove garlic
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 ts Sesame seeds
      1 ts Sesame oil
    1/4 ts Cayenne pepper
      1 ts Sugar
 
  This simple cucumber salad is a pleasant accompaniment to a hot summer
  night. Small cucumbers are suggested; they are not quite as watery as
  the large ones nor do they require peeling.
  
  1.  Slice the cucumbers in circles. Sprinkle salt over the cucumber
  slices, mix well and let them stand for 30 minutes. Place the
  cucumbers in a damp cloth and gently but firmly squeeze out as much
  water as possible. The less watery the cucumbers, the better tasting
  the dish.
  
  2.  Crush the garlic, then combine it with the cucumbers, salt, sesame
  seeds, sesame oil, pepper and sugar in a bowl. Mix well.

  Dissolve the creamed coconut in a jug of hot water, and stir in the
  turmeric. Fry the chilli, cumin seeds and crushed garlic in the oil
  for 2-3 minutes, then toss the prepared cucumber into the pan.
  Stir-fry for a minute or so. Pour the coconut milk in and heat
  through. Simmer for 5 minutes and it is ready to serve.

      Title: CUCUMBER WITH GOAT CHEESE
 Categories: Indian, Salads, Ceideburg 2
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Text Only
 
  This ultra-simple entree depends absolutely on the quality of its
  ingredients.  The cucumbers must be at their peak, the goat cheese
  the best you can buy and the oil hazelnut if possible but, in any
  case, a well-flavoured nut oil.  As hazelnut oil can be difficult to
  find, you could substitute a walnut or macadamia nut oil.
  
  Score 750 g of cucumbers lengthwise with the tines of a fork or peel
  them if you prefer.  Slice paper thin, put in a colander, sprinkle
  with salt and let them degorge for half an hour.
  
  Turn out of the colander, rinse and dry with paper towels. In a bowl
  toss the slices with 50 mL lemon juice, then arrange them on six
  plates. Dust with white pepper.
  
  Cut about 100 to 120 g firm goat cheese into thin slices and arrange
  two or three on each plate. Sprinkle 50 mL of hazelnut oil over the
  six servings.
  
  Makes 6 servings.

  One of the joys of making a kitchen garden is getting to grow and
  taste new and unusual varieties of vegetables.
  
  Unfamiliar vegetables are like unfamiliar people. They take time to
  get to know.  Lack of understanding can lead to mistakes takes. So I
  put most of my energy into growing my own garden tested favorites,
  and limit the number of unfamiliar varieties in each garden to just
  one or two.
  
  Elusive Habits: One year I tried ground cherries, Physalis pruinosa,
  which produce tiny tomato-like fruits in papery husks on low, lanky,
  herbaceous bushes. I planted them in a corner of the garden that
  didn't get much traffic, and never did see them sprout, or see them
  growing during the summer, either. I thought they died from neglect.
  
  When things thinned out later in the year, I discovered that the
  whole area was covered with the trailing vines of the ground
  cherries, and there were enough fruits to make an intensely-flavored
  and very wigged-out ground cherry pie.
  
  Ground cherries also are known as husk tomatoes, and are a smaller,
  more flavorful cousin of the tomatillo (Physalis ixocarpa) used in
  Mexican salsa verde. They're also related to the Hawaiian poha
  (Physalis peru viana).
  
  They like the same conditions as tomatoes, and thus will do best in
  the portions of the Bay Area that stay warmest at night. However, if
  you can grow tomatoes, you can grow ground cherries, and they're
  worth a try. They always pull their disappearing act if grown among
  other plants.
  
  They like to drape their long trailing branches over their neighbors'
  leaves, and run down among long grasses. Only becoming visible when
  the other plants die back late in the year.
  
  The plants are sprawling and grow about 18 inches tall. Their flowers
  are inconspicuous little bells less than a half-inch long, whitish
  yellow with brown spots. They set fruit sparingly until mid- season,
  when they finally produce large clusters of fruit that develop inside
  green ish husks. These dry when ripe to a lacy brown paper. The
  fruits are green and unpalatable until ripe, when they turn a rich
  golden yellowish brown.
  
  Small But Sweet: The fruits are the size of blueberries, and are
  intensely sweet with a low acid finish. They're surprisingly savory
  and good for preserves, although I prefer them in a
  once-every-five-years version of ground cherry pie. More often than
  that, and I get squeamish.
  
  Order ground cherry seed from Nichols Garden Nursery, 1190 North
  Pacific Highway, Albany, Oregon 97321.  A packet plus handling charge
  is $1.65. You'll enjoy having the Nichols catalog of herbs and rare
  seeds, too. [This info may be dated++the article is three years old.
  S.C.]
  
  Plant the seeds in the spring in an out-of-the-way part of the garden
  and make sure the area is not allowed to undergo severe water stress.
  Ground cherries are hardy, but not drought-proof.  They'll grow in
  any good garden soil.
  
  If you can avoid eating them all out of hand, try the pie. Jeff Cox,
  a Bay Area resident, an editor and writer for Rodale Press and author
  of several gardening books.
  
  Directions Gently mix together. ground cherries, sugar, tapioca,
  flour and lemon juice.  Let stand for 15 minutes while you line a
  9-inch pie pan with half of the pastry.
  
  Preheat the oven to 450 F.  Turn the fruit, mixture into the pastry-
  lined pan, and dot the top with the butter. Cover with a well-pricked
  top crust or lattice work of dough.
  
  Bake at 450F for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350F and bake for
  another 40 minutes, or until golden brown.

      Title: CUP OF FRIENDSHIP BECOMES KITCHEN QUANDARY
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------AND THEN THERE ARE FRIENDS----------------------
 
  QUOTED FROM: Rod Patterson's Column in the Oregonian FOODday Nov 15,
  1994.
  
   Last year, the 14-year-old son of a friend had a baby. More
  accurately, he had a 10-pound sack of rice, right off the grocery
  store shelf, that he swaddled in a worn, blue blanket. He wasn't
  supposed to let the precious bundle out of his sight for a couple of
  weeks.
   It was a school project, a lesson in responsibility. And a lesson
  between the lines in the perils of becoming a teen-age parent.
  
   You think taking care of a sack of rice is hard?  Try a real baby.
  That's what the school wanted to get across. Ha! Our public schools
  should wise up.  Throw out the rice babies. Give the kids some Amish
  Friendship Bread Starter!  Then the kids would learn responsibility.
  With a capital R. Real Fast! I'm three times the age of my friend's
  son, and I still had some learning to do.
  
   Another friend thrust a cup of the bread starter into my arms as I
  left his house the other day.  He shoved a piece of paper in my
  pocket. "It's Day Six," was all he said as he and his family waved
  goodbye. I could see them smiling knowingly in the rearview mirror.
   I was the recipient of a bread-starter version of the chain letter.
  My "baby" was given to me in an old plastic salsa container.
  
   DAY SIX.  The instructions, listing Day One through Day 10, said
  that was the day I was to add to the starter a cup of milk, a cup of
  sugar and a cup of flour and to mix well.
  
   Great. I got home late.  The milk in the refrigerator ~- barely a
  cup left -- was at the high end of its expiration date. I had just a
  cup of sugar. And, well, less than a cup of flour.
   But I was darned if I was going to go to the store when all I wanted
  to do was go to bed.  I dumped in what I had, mixed it up in a glass
  bowl and covered it with a dish towel. That would have to do.
  
   I liked Day Seven . It said to do nothing.
   All I had to do on Day Eight was stir the stuff.
   On Day Nine I was to do nothing again.
  
   The peace ended on Day Ten though.  I had to add more milk, sugar and
  flour.  I had to stir.  Then I was to take out three one-cup
  measurements and give two cups to two friends, saving a cup for
  myself.
  
   To the rest, I was to add a whole bunch of other stuff and bake some
  bread. Only trouble was, I hadn't gone to the store, and I had been
  out of milk, sugar and flour since Day Six. Day Ten came and went. So
  did Day Eleven.
  
   The actual culmination of the Amish Friendship Bread into edible
  form -- two beautiful, brown-topped loaves ~- came on Day Twelve,
  with no bad consequences.  In fact, the stuff was pretty good.
   And good it should have been.  After all, it took five days longer
  to make than the whole world did!

  temperature (100 F). Mix with milk with the yogurt in a basin. Put in
  a warm place for 4 to 5 hours to set as solid as yogurt.
  
  If using vinegar or lemon juice, stir into the milk and bring it to a
  near boil (200 F) in a bowl set in a saucepan of water. Remove and
  keep in a warm place for 4 to 5 hours.
  
  Pour the mixture into a sieve lined with a scalded clean cloth. After

  cool pantry, and it will keep for about a week. Drink the whey,
  flavored with fruit juice, for your health - or use to to make
  scones. Keep in refrigerator and eat within 2 days.

 Categories: Greek, Info/tips, Ethnic
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  If you own an olive tree and do not want to go through the complicated
  process of leaching olives with chemicals, follow one of these ancient
  Greek methods to get rid of the bitterness.
  
  SALTING METHOD: Place washed olives in a wicker basket or a plastic
  container with holes.  Cover with medium-coarse salt. Set basket in
  sun and protect with a cheesecloth cover. Twice a day for a week,
  toss olives to redistribute them, until the bitter fluid is drawn
  from them. Bring olives in at night to prevent mold.
  
  WATER METHOD:  Cover washed olives with a solution of salt water - 1
  cup salt to each quart water - in a crock or glass jar. Place a
  weight, such as a small plate or washed rock, to keep olives
  submerged. Olives may remain in this brine for months.  Marinate in
  Olive Marinade before serving.

  remove skin and entrails, leaving tentacles. Carefully cube tofu into
  exact 1" cubes, cause Al is particular or is that peculiar anyway 1"
  cubes please. Set squid aside in the sun while preparing
  brine/pickling mixture.

  sugar, Tabasco sauce and Secret Curmudgeon Sauce; mix thoroughly. Add
  minced garlic (Al usually uses 16 pounds per batch), Pickling spice,
  crushed red pepper and stir until well mixed.
  
  Place the onions, squid and tofu into brine solution making sure
  everything is submerged.  If necessary place a manhole cover on top
  of everything to keep the ingredients submerged. Allow the process to
  continue as long as you possibly stand without sampling.  It should
  be ready just about picnic time.  That's all ther is to it Folks.

  salt. Work in slowly the rest of the flour and the currants. Drop by
  spoonfuls on large buttered pans, pressing flat with a knife as the
  cakes are better when very thin. A good plan is to heat the pan a bit
  and allow the cakes to melt as much as possible before putting them
  in the oven to bake. Be sure to butter the pans thoroughly;
  otherwise, the thin cakes will be difficult to remove. (recipe didn't

      Title: CURRANT-WALNUT BAGUETTES
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 2 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
      1 pk Yeast
  1 1/2 tb Honey
  1 1/4 c  Warm water
  1 1/2 c  Bread flour
  1 1/2 c  Whole wheat flour
      1 ts Salt
    3/4 c  Walnut halves
    3/4 c  Currants
    1/4 c  Golden raisins
           Butter; for coating bowl
      1    Egg; beaten, for glaze
 
  This earty brown bread, shaped into long thin baguettes and densely
  packed with raisins and walnuts, is virtually impossible to stop
  eating. Renee first tasted a similar bread at the two-starred Michel
  Rostang in Paris. She likes to serve it with hearty soups, such as
  cream of pumpkin or squash, with curried chicken salad or cream
  cheese spreads, and, of course, with fruit and cheese.  Bread as good
  as this is worth the work.
  
  Directions: =========== Dissolve the yeast and honey in 1/4 cup warm
  water and let stand until foamy, about
       10    minutes.
  
  In a food processor fitted with a plastic dough blade, combine the
  flours and salt.  Process about 30 seconds. Add the walnuts and
  process an additional 15 seconds. With the machine running, pour the
  yeast mixture through the feed tube.
  
  With the machine running, slowly add 1 cup water through feed tube.
  Process until the dough clears the sides of the bowl and is no longer
  dry, about 1 minute additional.
  
  Turn out onto a lightly floured board and knead in the currants and
  raisins for about 5 minutes.
  
  Coat a large bowl with butter.  Transfer the dough to the bowl,
  turning to coat the top with butter.  Cover with plastic wrap and a
  towel and set aside to rise in a warm place, until the dough is
  doubled in bulk, about 1 to 1-1/2 hours.
  
  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board. Punch down to remove
  air bubbles and divide the dough into two equal parts. Roll each part
  into a 6 x 15-inch sheet. Roll the sheets into long cylinders,
  pinching the edges to seal.  Transfer the cylinders, seam side down,
  to a buttered baking sheet or two baguette pans. Cover with plastic
  wrap and a towel and set aside to rise until the dough is almost
  doubled, about 45 minutes.
  
  Preheat oven to 425.
  
  Brush the loaves with the beaten egg and slash each with a sharp knife
  several times along the diagonal. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until
  loaves are well browned.
  
  Yields 2 loaves

  Peel and core the apples, keeping a few curls of peel for a garnish.
  
  Mince this peel and keep it in water with a little lemon juice until
  needed.  Fry the curry powder in the butter until dark brown. Stir in
  about a quarter of the stock and cook until the mixture is smooth.
  Add the rest of the stock and the salt.  Mince the apples and drop
  immediately into the stock in order that they do not discolor in the
  air. Cover and allow to simmer, gently, for 20 minutes or until the
  apples are soft. Add the apple juice and blend well.  Chill the soup
  for several hours, or until needed. Add the chilled cream just before
  serving. Sprinkle a little ginger on top when you serve and garnish

      Title: CURRIED BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUP
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      4 tb Butter
      2 c  Onions, yellow, chopped
      4 ts Curry powder
      2    Butternut squash
      2    Apples
      3 c  Chicken Stock
      1 c  Apple juice
           Salt & pepper
      1    Granny Smith apple
 
  Squash and apples complement each other naturally; curry adds an
  exotic note. Feel free to experiment with other types of winter or
  summer squash.
  
    Melt the butter in a pot. Add chopped onions and curry powder and
  cook, covered, over low heat until onions are tender, about 25
  minutes.
    Meanwhile peel the squash (about 3 lbs). A regular vegetable peeler
  works best. Scrape out the seeds and chop the flesh.
    When the onions are tender, pour in the stock, add squash and the 2
  apples (peeled, cored and chopped). Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and
  simmer, partially covered, until squash and apples are very tender,
  about 25 minutes.
    Pour the soup through a strainer, reserving liquid, and transfer the
  solids to the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade, or
  use a food mill fitted with a medium disk. Add 1 cup of the cooking
  stock and process until smooth.
    Return the pured soup to the pot and add apple juice and additional
  cooking liquid, about 2 cups, until the soup is of desired
  consistency.
    Season to taste with salt and pepper, simmer briefly to blend and
  heat through. Shred Granny Smith apple, unpeeled. Serve soup
  immediately, garnished with shredded apple.

  Add rest of ingredients except green onions. Bring to a boil and
  simmer for 1/2 hour on low heat. Add the green onions the last 5
  minutes. DO AHEAD NOTES: Cook early in the day. Chicken and potatoes
  taste better after several hours in the sauce. It's great the next
  day. COMMENTS: Some people are quite surprised that the Chinese use
  potatoes in their cooking. It is quite a common vegetable in southern
  China, although not served the same way as the westerners do. Curry
  is the most popular seasoning for potatoes. Another is 5 spice powder.

      1    Or 2 eels
      1 lg Onion
           Parsley
    1/3 c  Flour
      1 tb Butter
      1    Scant teaspoon curry
 
  One large or two small eels are suitable for 4 persons. Skin the eel,
  cut in pieces as long as a finger and put in boiling salt water with
  a top of parsley.  Use water enough to cover only half the fish, so
  the stock will be good and strong.  Cook the eel until it is tender
  and keep it hot while making the sauce. Melt butter in a pot, brown a
  large onion and add flour and curry.  Dilute with the fish stock
  until the sauce is thick enough. Taste it, and if it is not strong
  enough add more curry. Pour it over the eel, serve in a deep dish and

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2    To 3 hard boiled eggs
      1    (10 oz.?) can unmarinated
           (plain) artichoke hearts
        x  Mayonnaise
        x  Sour cream
        x  Cumin powder

  Chop the eggs and artichoke hearts into chunks big enough to eat and
  small enough to scoop up on a cracker. Mix equal parts sour cream and
  mayonnaise, enough to make it all moist and tasty, and add spices to
  your taste @ 2 parts curry to one part cumin.  I like it spicy
  myself, but you don't want to overwhelm the delicate flavour of the
  artichoke. Exceedingly popular at parties, and goes quickly; I make a
  batch, put it in the refrigerator, and gnosh my way through it in a
  day or so!

      Title: CURRIED EGGPLANT STRUDEL
 Categories: Appetizers, Rcrockett, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 lg Eggplant -- peeled/diced
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 c  Chopped onion
      1 tb Olive oil
      1    Garlic clove -- minced
      1 tb Curry powder
      1 ts Ground cumin
      1 ts Chili powder
      1 c  Chopped canned tomatoes
      2 tb Sugar
    1/4 ts Ground saffron
    1/4 c  Vinegar
    1/2 c  Roasted peanuts -- chopped
      1 lb Frozen phyllo dough (24
           Sheets) -- defrosted
    3/4 lb Unsalted butter --
           Clarified
      1 c  Plain yogurt
 
  Toss the eggplant with the salt and set aside for 30 minutes. Wrap in
  a towel and squeeze out any excess moisture. Set aside.
  
  In a skillet, saute the onion in the olive oil over medium heat until
  soft, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic, curry powder, cumin and chili
  powder, and cook
        2    more minutes.
  
  Add the reserved eggplant, tomatoes and sugar. Mix the saffron into
  the vinegar and add to mixture. Simmer for 15 minutes, until the
  eggplant is soft. Add a bit of water if the mixture should become too
  dry.
  
  Add the peanuts and cool completely.
  
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
  
  Place a sheet of phyllo on a clean work surface and drizzle lightly
  with clarified butter. Layer five more sheets, drizzling a bit more
  butter atop each layer. Brush the top layer with butter.
  
  Place a quarter of the filling over the sheets, mounding more of it
  along one of the longer sides. Roll the sheets up jelly roll-style,
  starting at the edge with the mounded filling. Place seam-side down
  on a greased sheet pan and brush with more cla rified butter. Make
  three more strudels using the rest of the phyllo and the remaining
  filling and butter.
  
  On sheet pans, bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about
  25 to 30 minutes, moving the pans front to back and top to bottom
  halfway through. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving.
  
  Cut the strudel in 1-inch-thick slices and top with yogurt.

      4    Pairs of jumbo frog's legs
           -(about 1 pound), trimmed
      1    Stalk fresh lemon grass,
           -or 1 tablespoon dried
           -lemon grass
      2    Fresh red chile peppers,
           -seeded and sliced
      2    Shallots, sliced
      2    Garlic cloves, crushed
  1 1/2 ts Sugar
      1 ts Curry paste
      2 ts Curry powder
    1/4 ts Salt
      2 tb Nuoc mam
           -(Vietnamese fish sauce)
      2 oz Cellophane (bean thread)
           -noodles
      2 tb Vegetable oil
      1    Small onion, chopped
      1 c  Chicken broth or water
    1/2 c  Coconut milk or heavy cream
      1 ts Cornstarch
           Freshly ground black pepper
           Coriander sprigs,
           -for garnish
 
      This delicious lemon grass and coconut-laced curry comes from
  southern Vietnam. If you prefer a very hot curry, simply use more
  chile peppers.
  
      Cut the frogs' legs into bite-size pieces. Rinse with cold water
  to remove any chipped bones. Pat dry and refrigerate.
  
      If you are using fresh lemon grass, discard the outer leaves and
  upper half of the stalk. Cut into thin slices and finely chop. If you
  are using dried lemon grass, soak it in warm water for 1 hour. Drain
  and finely chop.
  
      In a blender, combine the lemon grass with the chiles, shallots,
  garlic, sugar, curry paste, curry powder, salt and 1 tablespoon of
  the fish sauce. Process to a very fine paste. Rub the paste over the
  frogs' legs. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
  
      Meanwhile, soak the cellophane noodles in warm water for 30
  minutes. Drain. Cut into 2-inch sections.
  
      Heat the oil in a saucepan over moderate heat. Add the onion and
  saute until translucent. Add the frogs' legs and brown well on all
  sides, about 3 minutes. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil.
  Reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 15 minutes.
  
      Uncover the pan and add the coconut milk, the cornstarch diluted
  in 1 tablespoon of cold water and the remaining 1 table- spoon fish
  sauce. Cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens, about 15 minutes.
  
      Add the cellophane noodles and bring the mixture to a boil.
   Remove from the heat.
  
      Sprinkle with black pepper and garnish with coriander sprigs.
  
      Serve immediately with rice, French bread or over rice noodles.
  
      Note: Instead of discarding the upper half of the lemon grass,
  crush it and cook it with the frogs' legs for extra flavor. Remove
  the stalk before serving.

      Title: CURRIED FRUIT
 Categories: Fruit, Holiday
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      5 lb Fruit (pears, peaches,
           -pineapple, apricot, etc.)
     12    Cherries
    3/4 c  Light brown sugar
      3 ts Curry powder
    1/3 c  Butter, melted
    3/4 c  Almonds (blanched),
           -slivered
 
  Add sugar and curry powder to melted butter and mix well. Drain all
  fruit well.  Arrange fruit and nuts in layers in casserole dish.
  There should be enough fruit to fill the dish about three-quarters
  full. Pour butter mixture over fruit.
  
  Bake at 325 degrees F. for one hour.    Refrigerate overnight. Reheat
  at 350 degrees F. until hot before serving (about 10-15 minutes).
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Baked fruit with curry sauce and nuts -- This dish can be served
  as a desert, alone, or on top of ice cream or pound cake (or both!).
  But, our favorite way of serving it is as a side dish at brunch on
  Christmas day. As long as I can remember, Mom has had this dish,
  along with an egg/cheese casserole, bacon and muffins for Christmas
  brunch. It is especially easy since you make it a day ahead of time.
  Yield: Serves 8-12.
  
  *  I use standard American "curry powder".  Any other that you want
  to use should be ok.  Adjust the amount of curry powder to your
  taste, or use cinnamon if you really don't like the flavor of curry.
  
  Use your imagination in choosing the fruits to go in it. Cherries and
  almonds are a must, but the rest is up to you. We use canned fruit,
  but fresh would be good too.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking, overnight cooling.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

 Categories: Main dish, Game
      Yield: 14 Servings
 
      1    Goat; around 25 pounds,
           -quartered

MMMMM------------------------CURRY PASTE-----------------------------
      4 md Onions; chunked
    3/4 c  Curry powder
      1    Whole *bulb* garlic; peeled
      1 tb Salt
      1    To 2 fresh Habaneros   -OR-
      1    Scotch Bonnet chiles; minced
           -OR-
      4    To 5 fresh Jalapenos; minced
      1 c  Oil; pref. canola or corn

MMMMM--------------------CURRY MOP  (OPTIONAL-------------------------
      2 c  Chicken or beef stock or
           -beer
      2 c  Cider vinegar
  1 1/2 c  Oil (corn or canola)
      1 c  Water
      2 tb Curry powder
           Your Favorite Barbecue sauce
 
  NOTE: Be CAREFUL when handling Habaneros or Scotch Bonnets!
  
     The night before you plan to barbecue, prepare the paste in a food
  processor. First process the onions, curry, garlic, salt and habaneros
  until finely chopped. Then add the oil, processing until the mixture
  forms a thick paste. This can be done in two batches if needed.
  
     Wearing rubber gloves, rub the paste over the goat, covering the
  meat evenly. Place the goat in a plastic bag and refrigerate
  overnight.
  
     Before you begin to barbecue, remove the goat from the
  refrigerator and let it sit, covered, at room temperature for 45
  minutes.
  
     Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature to 200
  to 220 degrees F.
  
     If you plan to baste the meat...mix together the mop ingredients
  in a saucepan and warm the liquid over low heat.
  
     Transfer the goat to the smoker. Cook for about 1-1/4 hours per
  pound of weight for each quarter. The forequarters will be done
  earlier than the hindquarters, which may take 10 hours or longer,
  depending on size. In a wood-burning pit, turn the meat and drizzle
  the mop over it every 30 minutes. In other styles of smokers, baste
  as appropriate and turn the meat at the same time.
  
     When the meat is done, remove it from the smoker, and allow it to
  sit for 15 minutes before serving. Slice or shred the meat and serve
  with... [your favorite barbecue sauce].

      1 c  Unsifted flour
  2 1/4 ts Salt
    1/8 ts Pepper
  1 1/2 ts Curry powder
      4 ts Sweet pepper flakes
      1 tb Instant miced onions
  2 1/4 qt Hot milk
  1 1/4 lb Cooked turkey -- diced (4
           Cups)
    3/4 lb Cooked ham -- diced (2
           Cups)
 
  Line four 8x8x2-inch baking pans with heat-resistant freezer wrap.
  Allow enough extra wrap to fold over top. Use one pan for each six
  servings or one-fourth of the recipe. Do not line pans for food to be
  served without freezing.
  
  Melt fat.  Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and curry powder. Add pepper
  flakes and onion. Stir in milk slowly. Cook until thickened, stirring
  constantly. Stir in turkey and ham.
  
  TO SERVE WITHOUT FREEZING:  Heat to serving temperature after turkey
  and ham are stirred into hot mixture. Serve over hot toast or
  biscuits.
  
  TO FREEZE:  Pour each fourth of the mixture to be frozen into a
  baking pan. Pack food tightly to avoid air pockets. Cool for 30
  minutes at room temperature. Complete wrapping by pulling paper up
  over top of food. Put edges of wrap together and fold several times
  so paper lies directly on top of food.  Fold ends of freezer wrap
  over the top and seal with freezer tape.  Label with name of food,
  date of freezing, and last date the food should be used for best
  eating quality (about 6 months). Freeze immediately for 10 to 12
  hours before removing packages from the pans.
  
  TO HEAT FROZEN CURRY:  Preheat oven to 350B0 F. (moderate). Remove
  freezer wrap.  Place food in baking pan. Bake 1 hour or until mixture
  is bubbly at edges. Stir occasionally during heating. After heating,
  stir gently until sauce is smooth.  Serve over hot toast or biscuits.

           -the rack, about 2 lbs
           Salt and freshly ground
           -pepper to taste
      1 tb Curry powder
      1 tb Peanut oil
      1 tb Butter

    1/2 c  Fresh or canned chicken
           -broth
      1 ts Tomato paste
      1 tb Finely chopped parsley
 
  Lamb is one of the greatly under-utilized meats here in the US, I
  think. There are a variety of recipes from around the world to
  inspire you. Actually, I was looking for my Mongolian lamb recipe but
  don't have it typed in (just use any ol' Mongolian beef recipe and
  substitute lamb for the beef and don't over cook it).
  
  Sprinkle the chops on both sides with salt and pepper. Rub them on
  both sides with curry powder to coat evenly.
  
  Heat oil in a skillet large enough to hold the chops in one layer.
  Add the chops and cook until browned on one side, about 2 minutes.
  Turn and brown on second side, about 2 minutes. Turn onto the fatty
  rims and continue cooking until the rims are rendered of fat, about 2
  minutes.
  
  Turn the chops flat side down and cook, turning them occasionally. The
  total cooking time should be about 15 minutes. Transfer the chops to
  a dish and pour off all the fat from the skillet.
  
  Add 1 tablespoon of the butter to the skillet and heat. Add the
  shallots and cook, stirring, about 15 seconds. Add the wine and bring
  to a boil. Cook for about 1 minute and then add the chicken broth and
  tomato paste. Cook over moderately high heat until reduced to about
  1/3 cup. Swirl in the remaining butter and pour the sauce over the
  chops. Serve sprinkled with parsley.
  
  Serves 4.

      1    Onion slice thinly
 
  I cook lamb occasionally in my Asian recipes, but not often as no one
  but myself likes it here.  The main thing to remember about lamb is
  that it should be medium rare. Actually, I like it seared on the
  outside and nearly raw in the middle, but these days that's not such
  a hot idea. Heat oil in a heavy skillet with a tight-fitting lid. Add
  shanks and brown slowly on all sides.  Remove shanks form pan. Add
  flour and curry powder to drippings and blend well; add water and
  wine, stirring, until thickened.
  
  Return shanks to pan, season with salt, garlic salt and pepper. Top
  with onions.  Cover and simmer gently for 1 1/2 hours until tender.
  
  Serves 4.

      1 c  Water
    1/2 ts Baby dried red chillies
     15    Ghee
      1 tb Grated fresh ginger
      2    Cloves garlic, crushed

    150    Baby mushrooms, sliced
      2 ts Plain flour
      1 tb Water, extra
      1 tb Chopped fresh basil
 
  The photo of this recipe looks wonderful too.  Whole shelled mussels
  in a white "curry" sauce along with slices of button mushrooms and
  other goodies.  The curry isn't what we would normally think of as a
  curry++ there isn't any curry powder called for (though it would
  probably be good).
  
  1:  Scrub mussels under cold running water; remove beards. Combine
  mussels and water in large saucepan, cover, bring to boil, reduce
  heat, simmer for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Drain mussels,
  remove and discard shells; reserve mussels.
  
  2:  Place chillies in small bowl, cover with boiling water, let stand
  for 10 minutes; drain and chop chillies. Heat ghee in medium frying
  pan, add chillies, ginger, garlic, lemon grass and shallots, stir
  over medium heat for about 2 minutes or until shallots are soft.
  
  3:  Stir in coconut milk, sauce and sugar, bring to boil, reduce heat,
  simmer, uncovered, for 1 minute. Stir in mushrooms, cook over medium
  heat for 1 minute. Blend flour with extra water, stir into mushroom
  mixture, stir over high heat until sauce boils and thickens.
  
  4:  Stir in mussels and basil, stir over medium heat until heated
  through.
  
  Serves 4.

  :          roasted pumpkin seeds OR
        2 TB chives -- finely chopped
        1 c  sour cream -- optional
  
  In a medium-large saucepan, saute the onions and scallions in butter
  until golden brown.  Stir in the pumpkin. Add the chicken broth, bay
  leaf, brown sugar, curry powder, nutmeg, and parsley and simmer,
  uncovered, for 15 minutes. Transfer the soup to a food processor and
  puree with the half-and-half or chicken stock to reach the desired
  consistency, creamy with medium density. Add salt and pepper to
  taste. Serve with a handful of roasted pumpkin seeds or chopped
  chives. A small dollop of sour cream or creme fraiche may also be
  used to garnish. How to Cook Your Pumpkin: One 3-pound pumpkin
  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut the pumpkin in half vertically
  and discard the seeds and stringy pulp. Place the pumpkin, cut-sides
  down, in a shallow baking dish and add water about a 1/2 inch high.
  Bake for about 1 hour or until tender. The pumpkin is ready when it
  is easily pierced with a fork. Cut each half into wedges and peel. A
  3-pound pumpkin yields about 3 pounds cooked.

           - trimmed, cut into
           - 2-in lengths, blanched
           - for 2 minutes
      4 oz Shiitake mushrooms
           - stems removed
           - and cut into thick slices
      1 c  Slivered almonds; toasted
     10 oz Frozen "petite" peas
           - defrosted
     16 oz Frozen pearl onions
           - defrosted
      1 lb All-butter puff pastry
           - defrosted in the
           - refrigerator if frozen
      1    Egg; mixed with
      1 tb -Water, for egg wash
 
  PREHEAT OVEN TO 425F. Invert a 3-quart oval or rectangular casserole,
  preferably earthenware or porcelain, onto a piece of parchment or
  waxed paper. Trace the shape, adding a 1-inch border all around, then
  cut it out. In a large heavy skillet, heat the butter over medium
  high heat until it foams. Whisk in the flour, adjust the heat to
  medium low, and continue cooking until the flour is light-cream
  colored, about 2 minutes. Stir in the clam broth, sherry, cream and
  lemon juice. Adjust the heat to medium high, and slowly bring the
  mixture to a boil, stirring constantly. Cook 30 seconds longer. It
  will be quite thick. Remove the pan from the heat. Stir in the
  ginger, garlic, curry powder, red pepper, salt and black pepper. Let
  the mixture cook slightly, then fold in the parsley, lobster, shrimp,
  carrots, mushrooms, almonds, peas and onions. Scrape the filling into
  the casserole. On a slightly floured work space, roll the puff pastry
  to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Cut it out, using the paper template. In
  the center of the pastry, cut out an air hole about 1/2 inch in
  diameter. Place the pastry over the casserole, pressing it down on
  the sides to seal. Cut the remaining pastry into strips or shapes and
  decorate the top of the pot pie. (This dish may be prepared ahead to
  this point, covered and refrigerated up to 1 day.) Brush the top with
  the egg wash. To help prevent the liquid from boiling over onto the
  crust, make a steam vent by rolling a 3-inch strip of heavy aluminum
  foil width-wise around a wooden spoon handle. Insert it gently into
  the hole. Remove spoon, leaving foil in place. Place the casserole on
  a cookie sheet and transfer it to the middle of the oven. Bake for 20
  minutes, then reduce heat to 375F and continue baking for 20-to-25
  minutes longer, or until the pastry is puffed and rich golden brown.
  Remove the pan, let it rest with the vent inside for 15-to-20 minutes
  to keep the crust from becoming soggy.

  made several hours  before serving, to get the full curry flavor.
  It's been a real hit at potlucks. Yield: serves 4 to 6.
  
  *  A honeydew ball is a ball of honeydew melon that is scooped out of
  the flesh of the melon with a "balling spoon" or "melon baller."
  About 1 1/3 cups of conchiglie will make about three cups of cooked
  macaroni.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  25 minutes (includes time to cook macaroni and make melon
  balls.) : Precision:  no need to measure.

  all the good stuff. Add cayenne and heat gently. Once it is hot,
  taste it to correct the seasonings. This is a fairly sweet soup; you
  may choose to adjust this by adding the fresh lemon juice ..to taste
  and topping each bowlful with a small spoonful of yogurt. Recipe by:

      Title: CURRY CHICKEN WITH GRAPES
 Categories: Poultry, Salads
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
      8    Chicken breast
           -halves (boned)
      6 c  Grapes, seedless
           -(or less; vary amount
           -to taste)
      2 c  Mayonnaise
      4 ts Curry powder
      3 ts Olive oil
      1 ts Cayenne pepper
    1/2 ts Black pepper, ground
      1 ts Fruit vinegar
 
  Make the sauce by mixing together all ingredients except the chicken
  and the grapes. Season to taste (sample by dipping a grape into the
  sauce and then eating it).
  
  Broil the chicken breasts (3-5 minutes on each side in a preheated
  broiler), then dice or shred into small bite-sized pieces.
  
  Mix chopped chicken with about 2 cups of whole grapes. Cover with the
  sauce. Add more grapes to taste. My taste is to add vast quantities of
  grapes.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Chicken fruit salad curry -- One day I was invited to a beach
  picnic, and asked to bring a salad. A friend and I got together in
  his kitchen and concocted a curried chicken salad with grapes. It was
  delicious, but we forgot to write down the recipe. After some more
  experimentation, I have come up with this recipe. I don't know if it
  is the same as what we made that day at the beach, but it is
  delicious.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  20 minutes including cooking the chicken.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

 Categories: Indian, Curry
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
      1 lb Shrimp or boneless, skinless
           -chicken breasts
  2 1/2 tb Oil
  1 1/2 ts Curry powder
    1/4 ts Red chili powder or
           -cayenne pepper
      1 ts Crushed garlic
      1 cn Crushed or whole skinless
           -tomatoes, chopped (1 lb)
      1 ts Crushed ginger (opt)
           Salt to taste
      1 tb Heavy cream (opt)
    1/4 c  Fresh chopped coriander
    1/2 ts Lemon juice
 
  If using shrimp, clean and devein. Saute them lightly on both sides
  until they become pinkish, then set aside. If using chicken, cut the
  meat into 1" strips and set aside. In a saucepan or wok, heat the oil
  and "splutter fry" the curry powder and red chili powder and then the
  garlic rapidly for 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes, then add the ginger,
  if desired, and salt; mix well and bring to a boil. Add the chicken
  or shrimp, and simmer until cooked (3-5 minutes for the shrimp, 6-10
  minutes for the chicken). Finally, do the "fimmering" process,
  simmering on high heat until the oil floats to the top for a minute
  or so. Remember that overcooking or overspicing can kill the curry.
  Use the optional cream to tame the curry or adjust the flavor.
  Garnish with freshly chopped coriander and a squeeze of lemon juice.

MMMMM-------------------------GRAVY BASE------------------------------
    1/2 pt Ghee OR Vegetable Oil
      5 tb Garlic Puree ( 5 portions)
      4 tb Ginger Puree ( 4 portions)
  2 1/2 pt Onion Puree  (10 portions)
  1 1/2 lb Canned Tomatoes and Juices

      2 tb Sugar

MMMMM---------------------------SPICES--------------------------------
      4 tb Masala Mild Curry Powder
      2 tb Paprika
  1 1/2 tb Turmeric
 
      This stock is one of the keys to achieving the "restaurant curry".
  
  1. Mix the spices with water to make a paste the consistency of
  catsup. Let it stand. 2. Heat 5 to 6 tablespoons of oil in a 6-8 pint
  sauepan. Stir-fry the garlic puree for 30 seconds, then add the
  ginger puree and cook for another 30 seconds. Add 5 to 6 more
  tablespoons of oil and when hot addthe spice mixture and stir-fry for
  another 30 seconds. Add the remaining oil and the onion puree and
  stir-fry gently for about 10 minutes. 3. Puree the canned tomatoes in
  a blender then add with the tomato paste to the pan. Mix in well and
  add enough water to get a medium thick soup consistency. Add sugar
  and salt to taste. 4. Simmer gently for at least 30 minutes and at
  most 1 hour. Reduce to a thickish but easily pourable applesauce
  texture. If it starts to get too dry add a little water. 5. Separate
  into 10 equal portion and freeze in small freezer containers.
  
  Substitute this curry gravy for the individual garlic, ginger and
  onion purees in many recipes. This is just a mild base to which you
  can add spices as required.

 Categories: Sauces, Foreign, Thai
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           *INGREDIENTS*
      6    Dried hot red chilies, 1 1/2
           -- 2 inches long
      2 tb Minced shallots or scallions
           -(white part only)
      1 tb Minced garlic
      1 tb Paprika
      1 tb Powdered sereh (powdered
           -dried lemon grass)
      1 tb Trassi (shrimp paste)
      1 ts Ground laos (ginger)
      1 ts Caraway seed
      1 ts Coriander seed
      1 ts Finely grated fresh lemon
           -peel
      1 ts Salt
 
  Source:Pacific and Southeast Asian Cooking - Time/Life
  
  *DIRECTIONS* Under cold running water, wash the chilies and remove
  their stems. Brush out any seeds that cling to the skin and break the
  pods into small pieces.
  
  To make red curry paste: combine the chilies, shallots (or scallions),
  garlic, paprika, sereh, trassi, laso, caraway, coriander, lemon peel
  and salt in the jar of an electric blender and blend at high speed
  for 20 to 30 seconds. Turn off the machine, scrape down the sides of
  the jar and blend again until the mixture is a smooth paste. Tightly
  covered and refrigerated, the paste may be safely kept for a month or
  so.
  
  To make green curry paste: substitute 6 fresh hot green chilies
  (about 2 inches long) for the dried red chilies and omit the paprika
  from the recipe. Then follow the above directions precisely. Green
  curry paste may be covered and refrigerated for about a month.
  
  *VARIATIONS*
  
  For a more fiery paste, include some seeds - the hottest part of the
  chili.

      Title: CURRY POWDER (SAROJINI MUDNANI'S #1)
 Categories: Mix, Indian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------------TO PARCH-------------------------------
      2 oz Cummin seed
      1 oz Black pepper
      6 oz Coriander seed
    1/2 oz Fenugreek seed

MMMMM-------------------------UNPARCHED------------------------------
      1 oz Cloves
      1 oz Cardamom
      2 oz Red chilles (hot ones)
      2 oz Cinnamon
      1 oz Mace
 
  Take the first four ingredients (those headed "To Parch") and roast
  in a moderate oven, or parch in a dry frying pan, until a rich aroma
  is given off, but taking care not to burn them. Allow to cool before
  mixing with the second batch of ingredients.
    Put the mixed cooled spices in a grinder (we use an old coffee
  grinder) and grind until finely powdered. Pass through a fine sieve,
  and if necessary re-grind. Store the mixed spices in a large jar with
  an airtight stopper. All spices keep best if stored in a cool dry
  dark place. Curry powder, if kept in an airtight jar, improves with
  moderate keeping (up to a year or so).

      Title: CURRY POWDER (SAROJINI MUDNANI'S #2)
 Categories: Mix, Indian
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      4 oz Cloves
      1 oz Cinnamon
      4 oz Black pepper
      1 oz Mace
      1 oz Cardamom
      4 oz Cummin seed
    1/2 oz Dry bay leaves
 
  Mix these spices together, and roast in a moderate oven, or parch dry
  in a large frying pan. The spices should be heated until they give
  off a rich aroma, but not burnt. Grind thoroughly (we use an old
  coffee grinder) and pass through a fine sieve (regrinding if
  necessary). Keep in an airtight stoppered bottle in a dark cool
  place, where the curry powder will improve for a year or so.
  
  This recipe will seem milder and more mellow than Sarojini Mudnani #1
  curry powder to those not used to the heat of curries, though the use
  of coriander and fenugreek will give the first a distinctive flavour.

      Title: CURRY POWDER FROM BETTER THAN STORE-BOUGHT
 Categories: Mixes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  2 1/2 ts Fenugreek

      1 ts Cardamom seeds
      3 tb Coriander seeds

    1/4 ts Ground mace
    1/4 ts Freshly ground nutmeg
      1 pn Cayenne pepper
           Or to taste
      2 tb Ground tumeric
           Toasted dried hot red
           Peppers to taste
           Seeds removed
 
  Preheat oven to 225~F, (yes 225); combine fenugreek, cardamom,
  coriander, cumin, mustard seeds, cloves, and broken cinnamom in a
  small pan and bake for 15 minutes, shaking the pan a few times; let
  cool; combine the toasted spices with the mace, nutmeg, cayenne,
  tumeric and toasted peppers in a spice mill or coffee  grinder,
  dedicated to spices; grind into a powder; store      airtight. Yield:
  1/2 cup. Note: Don't make a large amount of powder at once, as the
  flavors fade or become acrid if kept too long. This is a mild and
  more delicate powder than any
      store-bought version; make a small amount at first and adjust to
  your own taste. Chuck Ozburn

 Categories: Herb/spices, Thailand, Thai
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      5 sm Dried red chilies with
           Their seeds, broken into
           Small pieces OR
      1 ts Cayenne pepper
      1 ts Heaping whole black

      1 ts Ground black pepper
      1 tb Heaping whole coriander
           Seeds OR
      1 tb Ground coriander
      1 ts Heaping whole caraway
           Seeds OR
      1 ts Ground caraway
    1/2    Lemon's zest, minced
      2    Inch piece ginger root,
           Peeled and minced
      8 cl Garlic, peeled and minced
      4    Shallots, peeled and
           Minced
      1 ts Anchovy paste
      6    Sprigs coriander, finely
           Chopped
      1 ts Salt
      3 tb Vegetable oil
 
  Grind the whole spices and add any ground ones.  Into a food
  processor, pour the mixture and add the remaining ingredients (except
  for 1 tablespoon of the oil. Grind as fine as possible. Using a
  spatula, transfer the paste to a jar and pour in the last tablespoon
  of oil. Cap tightly and refrigerate until needed. Keeps 2 months in
  the refrigerator. Makes approximately 8 ounces.
  
  NOTES:  Although substitutions for hard-to-find ingredients have been
  made,
        this curry paste still carries the true flavor of Thailand. Use
  it in
        Thai curries unless otherwise specified.  A little added to
  stir-fry
        dishes or rubbed into chicken as a marinade before barbequing or
        grilling will add a real Thai accent.  A teaspoon added to a
  meatloaf
        mixture or meat balls, transforms them into something that is
  rather
        exotic, and when combined with peanut butter and coconut milk,
  it
        makes a tangy and aromatic sauce for Thai-style satays.
  
        Use whole spices whenever possible.  Anchovy fillets may be
        substituted for the anchovy paste.  Shallots are preferable to
  onions;
        if not available, use an equal amount of a red onion.

      Title: CUSCUS DOLCE (DESSERT COUSCOUS)
 Categories: Desserts, Italian
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
MMMMM-----------------------CUSTARD CREAM----------------------------
     60    Pistachio nuts
           Coarse-grained salt
      5    Extra-large eggs
      8 tb Sugar
      1 c  Heavy cream; cold
    1/2 c  Milk; lukewarm
      2 tb Rosewater

MMMMM--------------------------COUSCOUS-------------------------------
      1 lb Couscous (not instant)
      1 c  Water; cold
    1/2 ts Salt

MMMMM----------------------FOR THE STEAMER---------------------------
  3 1/2 c  Flour
      1 c  Water; cold

MMMMM-------------------TO FLAVOR THE COUSCOUS------------------------
      2 tb Sugar
      1 ts Confectioners' sugar
      5 dr Vanilla extract
      2 oz Semisweet chocolate
      3 oz Almonds; toasted
      2 oz Candied citron
      2 oz Candied orange peel
 
  In Sicily, couscous is even a dessert, incorporating the age-old
  Mediterranean almonds, rosewater, pistachio nuts, candied citron, and
  orange peel as well as chocolate and custard cream, which most likely
  were added in later centuries.
  
  Prepare the custard cream. Blanch the pistachio nuts in a pan of
  boiling water with coarse salt added (otherwise the nuts will turn
  yellow). Dry the nuts with paper towels, then finely chop them on a
  board or grind them in a food processor. Place the egg yolks in a
  medium-sized crockery or glass bowl, add the sugar, and use a wooden
  spoon to mix the sugar into the yolks until they turn a lighter
  color. Slowly add the cream, then the lukewarm milk, mixing steadily.
  Add the chopped nuts and the rosewater, and mix very well. Place in
  the top of a double boiler.
  
  Bring water to a boil in the bottom of the double boiler. When the
  water begins to boil, insert the top, making sure the water does not
  touch it, and stir constantly with a wooden spoon, always in the same
  direction. When the cream coats the spoon, just before it boils
  (absolutely do not allow the cream to boil), remove the top of the
  double boiler from the heat and continue to stir the contents for 1
  minute more. Transfer the custard to an empty wine bottle (to keep
  skin from forming), cork it, and refrigerate until needed.
  
  Prepare the couscous: Spread out the grain on a large serving platter
  or cookie sheet. Dissolve the salt in a small bowl with 1 cup of the
  water. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of the salted water on the grain, then
  use the fingers of one hand to rub some grains against the palm
  itself, using a rotating motion to incorporate the water evenly into
  the grain. Keep repeating this with additinal teaspoons of salted
  water and grains until you have used up 1/4 cup of water and the
  couscous is evenly wet all over. Spread the grain evenly over a
  cotton dish towel and let rest for 1 hour.
  
  Put 8 cups of water in stockpot. Put a strainer or steamer which fits
  snuggly over stockpot. Using the flour and a cup of cold water,
  prepare a thcik dough to seal the area connecting the two halves of
  the steamer. Roll this dough into a thick rope long enough to fit
  around the perimeter of the pot. Using the rope of dough, cover the
  circle where the top and bottom parts of the steam meet to seal it.
  Place the steamer over medium heat, and when the water reaches a boil
  and the steam begins to rise through the holes of the strainer, add
  the couscous grain. (It is also convenient to spread a cheesecloth
  over the strainer holes to facilitate removing the steamed grains.)
  Cover tightly with a lid and steam for 30 minutes.
  
  Spoon out the couscous onto a large platter and start rubbing the
  grains between the palms of your hands, incorporating the remaining
  3/4 cup of salted water, little by little to separate any that have
  stuck together and to retain an even and uniform consistency of
  individual grains. Let the couscous rest for 1 hour until cool.
  
  Mix the granulated and confectioners' sugar with the vanilla in a
  large bowl. Cut the chocolate into pieces the size of half an almond.
  Cut the toasted almonds in half and the candied fruit into pieces the
  same size. Add the couscous, chocolate, and almonds to the bowl with
  the sugar and mix very well. Transfer the couscous to a large serving
  platter and arrange it in one thick layer. Pour the cooled custard
  cream over the couscous and serve, spooning out the sweet grain
  topped with custard sauce.

      Title: CUSCUSU DI PISTACHI
 Categories: Desserts, Fruits/nuts, Italian
      Yield: 10 Servings
 
MMMMM--------------------FOR SEALING THE PAN-------------------------
      1 c  All-purpose flour
    1/2 c  Water

MMMMM--------------------------COUSCOUS-------------------------------
      1 c  Couscous, not instant
      3 c  Water

MMMMM------------------FLAVORING & 2ND STEAMING-----------------------
      1 tb Water
    1/2 ts Salt
  1 1/2 c  Shelled green pistachios
           - unsalted and very green
      1 ts Almond extract
      1 ts Cinnamon
    1/4 c  Almond oil
           -=OR=- Mild vegetable oil

MMMMM-------------------------FINISHING------------------------------
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 tb Water
    1/4 c  Confectioners' sugar
      1 oz Semisweet chocolate
           - finely grated
           Candied cherries
           -=OR=- Other Candied Fruit
           - (to garnish)
 
  Couscous is normally a savory dish found in Morocco. This unusual
  dessert version is the specialty of a small convent in Sicily.
  
  FIRST PREPARE THE PAN for steaming the couscous: For the sealing
  dough, mix the flour and water together in a bowl and scrape onto a
  floured work surface. Knead briefly to form a rough, sticky dough,
  adding a tablespoon or 2 of flour if necessary. Roll into a rope as
  long as the circumference of the bottom pan and apply the dough to
  the rim of the pan. Add water to the pan so that the water is below
  the bottom of the couscousiere or colander and press the couscousiere
  into place. Bring the water to a boil on high heat, until steam is
  escaping freely through the perforations, then lower to a simmer, so
  that the steam escapes very gently. While the water is coming to a
  boil, prepare the couscous to be cooked: Place the grain in a bowl
  and add the water. Swish the water through the grain with the fingers
  of one hand splayed apart, "raking" through it. Tilt the bowl and
  drain away excess water. Set aside for 5 minutes. Line the
  couscousiere with a dampened napkin or cheesecloth and add the grain.
  Cover and steam 15 minutes. While the grain is cooking, prepare the
  flavoring. Half fill a saucepan with water and add the pistachios.
  Bring to a boil; drain in a strainer. Pour the pistachios onto a
  towel, fold the towel over them and rub to loosen skins. Separate
  pistachios from skins, going over them carefully. Combine the freshly
  blanched pistachios, extract and cinnamon in a food processor bowl
  and process for 2-3 minutes, until very finely ground and starting to
  become pasty. Add the oil, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue
  processing mixture to a smooth paste, stopping the machine and
  scraping the inside of the bowl 3-or-4 times. Reserve pistachio
  paste. After the couscous has steamed 15 minutes, remove it from the
  couscousiere in the cheesecloth and put it in a large, non-reactive
  roasting pan. Spread it out with a fork and let cool. Combine the
  salt and water and work it into the cooled couscous, raking it
  through with 1 hand. Add the pistachio paste in 3-or-4 additions,
  working it in by rubbing it and the couscous together with the
  fingertips. Return the water in the bottom pan to a simmer, and line
  the couscousiere again with the dampened cheesecloth. Add the
  seasoned couscous to the couscousiere, cover and steam 15 minutes.
  Remove the couscous to the roasting pan, spread out with a fork,
  without compressing the mixture, and leave uncovered until cool. To
  finish the couscous, bring the sugar and water to a boil, stirring to
  dissolve all sugar granules, and cool the syrup. Work the cooled
  couscous between the palms of the hands again to separate the grains
  and toss in the syrup in 5-or-6 additions, fluffing the couscous with
  a fork. Allow the couscous to dry uncovered, several hours, in a cool
  place, fluffing it with a fork occasionally, until all the grains are
  separate. For advance preparation, cover tightly with plastic wrap
  and refrigerate up to several days. To serve, fluff up with a fork so
  the grains separate well and mound the couscous on a platter.
  Sprinkle the couscous evenly with the grated chocolate, then the
  confectioners' sugar. Decorate with no more than 5-or-6 pieces of the
  candied fruit.

      Title: CUSINE D'OR CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES
 Categories: Chocolate, Cookies
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
  2 1/8 c  Flour
    3/4 ts Baking soda
        pn Salt
      1 c  Unsalted butter, slightly
           -cooler than room temp.
  1 3/4 c  (-1 1/2 T) brown sugar,
           -firmly packed
  1 1/2 tb Corn syrup
      2 lg Eggs, room temperature,
           -lightly beaten
      2 ts Vanilla extract
    1/8 ts Almond extract
      8 oz Swiss milk chocolate,
           -cut into small chunks
      8 oz Swiss semisweet chocolate,
           -cut into small chunks
 
  Crisp outsides and chewy centers, are often achieved by undercooking.
  In this recipe a small amount of corn syrup is substituted for some
  of the granualted sugar, for a chewy texture without being soft or
  undercooked. Store cookies in the refrigerator. Mix flour with soda
  and salt. Set aside. With an electric mixer, cream the butter until
  softened. Add sugar; cream until light and fluffy. Blend in the corn
  syrup, scraping down the bowl often. Blend in the lightly beaten
  eggs, and vanilla and almond extracts. If the mixture seems curlded
  or unhomogenous, add a bit of the flour mixture to bind it. Stir dry
  ingredients into creamed mixture, scraping down sides of bowl
  occasionally. Stir in chocolate pieces gently by hand. Chill batter
  20 minutes. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Drop by rounded
  teaspoonfuls onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Flatten cookies very
  slightly. Bake at 350 degrees F. for 12 minutes, or until cookies are
  lightly golden brown. Cool 1 minute on pans, then remove to cooling
  rack. Store in the refrigerator to preserve flavors. Yield: 4 dozen.

      Title: CUSTARD APPLE CREAM
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 8 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
      3 ts Gelatine
    1/3 c  Boiling water
    500 g  Cream cheese, softened
    1/2 c  Caster sugar
    190 ml Cream
      2 lg Custard apples
 
  This dessert is related to cheesecake but while it has the latter's
  richness, it is much more subtle. Because of that subtlety, it is
  difficult to decorate in any way. At most, you could try some shaved
  curls of white chocolate, but it is at its best with no more than a
  thin topping of completely plain pouring cream.
  
  Dissolve 3 teaspoons of gelatine in one third of a cup of boiling
  water. Beat 500 grams of softened cream cheese thorough- ly, then add
  the gelatine mixture, half a cup of caster sugar, 190 mL cream and
  the pureed flesh of 2 fairly large custard apples. Beat until smooth
  then pour into 8 dessert glasses or pots.
  
  Refrigerate for 2-3 hours.

           Stephen Ceideburg
    400 ml Custard apple flesh
    200 ml Cream
    100 g  Caster sugar
 
  Delicate in flavour, this ice-cream originates in the Caribbean. It
  could hardly be simpler to make.
  
  Puree 400 mL of custard apple flesh (you will need 2 medium to large
  custard apples). Add 200 mL cream and 100 g caster sugar Stir well
  then stir again from time to time until the sugar has dissolved. Pour
  into an ice-cream maker and freeze. Or if you don't own this
  appliance, pour the mixture into a metal freezing tray(s) and freeze,
  stirring with a fork from time to time as an icy mush forms at the
  edges.
  
  When the whole mixture is a mush remove from the fridge, beat well and
  freeze again until required. Soften in the body of the fridge for
  15-20 minutes before serving.

  weight it down. Bake for about 10-to-12 minutes or until the dough is
  lightly browned. In a saucepan, boil together the water and sugar for
  5 minutes to make a light syrup. Let the syrup cool thoroughly and
  combine it with the eggs. Pour an equal amount of custard into each
  pastry shell. Reduce the oven heat to 325F and bake for 15 minutes or

      Title: CUSTARD TIPS (KH)
 Categories: Tips, Custards
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
           See below
 
  Stirred Custard: The standard test is to cook until mixture will
  "coat the back of a metal spoon," not as easy to determine as it
  sounds because uncooked custard will also leave a film on a spoon.
  The difference is that cooked custard should leave a thick,
  translucent, almost jellylike coat about the consistency of gravy. If
  you suspect that custard is on the verge of curdling, plunge pan into
  ice water to stop cooking.
  
  Baked Custard: Insert a table knife into custard midway between rim
  and center (not in the middle as cookbooks once instructed). If knife
  comes out clean, custard is done. Remove at once from water bath and
  cool. To chill quickly, set custard in ice water-but only if baking
  dish is one that can take abrupt changes of temperature without
  breaking.
  
  What to Do About Curdled Custard: If it's baked custard, the best
  idea is to turn it into a Trifle by mixing with small hunks of
  cake=7F if stirred custard, strain out the lumps and serve as a sauce
  over cake, fruit, or gelatin dessert.
  
  Caution: Keep custards refrigerated; they spoil easily, often without
  giving a clue.

      Title: CUTTLEFISH WITH SPINACH
 Categories: Greek, Seafood
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Karen Mintzias
    750 g  Cuttlefish or squid
    1/3 c  Olive oil
           Water
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
    750 g  Spinach
      1 c  Chopped spring onions
    1/2    Lemon (juice only)
 
  Cuttlefish (soupies) as distinct from squid (kalamaria) are preferred
  for this dish, though either may be used. Cleaning cuttlefish can be
  a rather messy business as these marine molluscs have an ink sac from
  which the pigment sepia is obtained.  The sac ruptures easily and is
  usually ruptured by the time you purchase them, so don't be put off
  by their colour ~ the ink rinses off easily.
  
  Rinse cuttlefish or squid and remove head, attached tentacles and
  intestines; discard intestines.  Pull out cuttle bone or fine
  transparent bone if squid is being prepared. Pull off fine skin and
  rinse. Remove eyes and beak from head, leave head attached to
  tentacles and pull or rub off skin from tentacles, or as much skin as
  will easily come off.
  
  Slice hood or body into strips.  If squid are large, slice head and
  tentacles - cuttlefish tentacles are usually small and these are left
  intact.  Place prepared cuttlefish or squid in pan and set on medium
  heat. Cover and cook for 15 minutes in its own juice. Add half the
  oil, just enough water to cover, and salt and pepper to taste, cover
  and simmer gently for 45 minutes or until tender.
  
  Meanwhile trim spinach and wash thoroughly.  Drain well and chop
  leaves and stalks coarsely.
  
  Heat remaining oil in a separate pan and gently fry spring onion until
  soft, add spinach and stir over heat until it wilts. Add spinach
  mixture to cuttlefish or squid with lemon juice and adjust seasonings
  with salt and pepper.  Cover and simmer for further 10-15 minutes.
  Serve hot.

      Title: CZECH DUMPLINGS
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 pk Yeast
      1 ts Sugar
    1/2 c  Milk; scalded and cooled
      1 c  Milk; warm
      1    Egg
    1/2 ts Salt
  3 1/2 c  Flour
      3    Slices white bread; cubed
 
  There are a number of different kinds of dumplings in the Czech
  cuisine, but if you are serving a pork roast with sauerkraut, I
  recommend bread dumplings. Make sure you use the drippings from the
  roast to make gravy for these! Mix the first three ingredients, let
  stand for 10 minutes. Mix the warm milk, egg, salt, yeast mixture and
  flour. Add the bread cubes. Knead the resulting dough just as you
  would when making bread. Let the dough rest in a warm place to rise.
  It should double in about 2 hours. Knead again; divide into 3 long
  rolls, each about 1 1/2 " thick. Let rise another 1/2 hour. Drop the
  rolls of dough, one at a time, into a large kettle of boiling water.
  Boil gently for about 15 minutes. Remove with slotted spoons and
  place on a buttered platter. Keep warm. When ready to serve, slice
  the rolls into individual slices by using a length of thread. Loop it
  around one dumpling and pull tight to slice off a piece about 2"
  thick. (This is the fun part! You can get pretty good at this
  garrotting if you practice!!) You should end up with about 2 dozen
  slices. My cookbook says, "These freeze well - steam before serving."
  (I've never tried that!!) If you would prefer potato dumplings to
  these, just say so. The only problem with them is they sometimes get
  a bit "slimy" or mushy. I like them that way, but they don't look as
  presentable as the bread dumplings.

 Categories: Vegetables, Korean
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
     10    Pieces dried black kelp;
           -each 3-inches
      1 c  Corn oil
      2 tb Sugar
 
  The hallmark of Korean cooking is the use of the natural foods in
  appealing ways. Seaweed, which is now domesticated, that is to say
  raised on farms jutting out into the sea, supplements food that is
  raised on land. Containing iodine and a host of other minerals and
  with a flavor reminiscent of an ocean breeze, the fried kelp
  (Laminaria japonica) with a light sprinkling of sugar is an example
  of the culinary ingenuity of the Koreans.
  
  1. Wipe each piece of the dried kelp with a damp (not soaking) cloth.
  
  2. Heat the oil in a skillet over moderate heat. One at a time, put a
  very lightly dampened piece of kelp in the hot oil, holding it with
  chopsticks, until the color changes to dark green. Bubbles may appear
  on the kelp surface and it will develop a crispness.
  
  3. While the kelp is still hot sprinkle on a few grains of sugar. The
  sugar will cling to the kelp when it is still hot and just removed
  from the oil. It will not do so when cold.
  
  Eat as a side dish or snack food with tea or a drink.
  
  Serves 4 to 6.

      Title: DAD'S KALUSKI
 Categories: Polish, Potatoes
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 c  Flour
      4 c  Mashed Potatoes
      1 tb Salt
      4    Eggs

MMMMM------------------------ONION SAUCE-----------------------------
      1 lg Onion
      4 tb Butter
           Salt
           Pepper
 
  This recipe is appoximate.  One of the controlling factors is the
  amount of leftover mashed potatoes you have----- Besides, Dad never
  did write this one down!
  
  KALUSKI:
  
  Blend flour and salt.
  
  Make a well with the flour.  Mix in the eggs, thoughly, one at a
  time. Add the mashed potatoes.
  
  You should have a dough that is not quite as stiff as a noddle dough.
  Add a little water, if necessary, to thin it out.
  
  Roll the dough into long strands, about 1 inch in diameter. Cut into
  sections about 1 1/2 inches long.
  
  Gently add to a large pot of boiling water.  Do not add too many, nor
  add them too fast.  You want to keep the water boiling. They are down
  when they start to float. Remove the floaters to a bowl, and continue
  till you finish off the dough pieces.
  
  ONION SAUCE:
  
  Melt butter in pan.  Add coarsely sliced/diced onion. Saute to taste.
  I like them just trasparent, Dad liked them browned, almost burnt.
  Salt and pepper, to taste.
  
  SERVE:
  
  You've got a few options, here---
  
     A:  Pour Onion Sauce over the whole batch
     B:  Serve each separately, for the whinners
         who don't like onions.  Plain butter
         works out, just fine.
     C:  As a side dish, they are great with
         meat gravy
  
  LEFTOVERS:
  
  Should you be fortunate to have some left over, just place in the
  refrigerator.  They are ok, cold, but just reheat in a frying pan.
  They heat more evenly if you slice the kaluski into somewhat smaller
  pieces.

  Note just above the recipe says that this bread was inspired by fond
  memories of Linda's Dad sitting at the table pouring milk over his
  rice and putting cinnamon & sugar on top. Also notes to watch dough
  ball as it varies each time you make it and that if you use freshly
  cooked rice you will need to add extra liquid. 1. Place all
  ingredients except raisins in bread pan, using the least amount of
  liquid listed in the recipe. Select Light Crust setting and
  Raisin/Nut cycle. Press start. 2. Observe the dough as it kneads.
  After 5 to 10 minutes, if it appears dry & stiff or if your machine
  sounds as if it's straining to knead it, add more liquid 1 tbsp. at a
  time until dough forms a smooth, soft, pliable ball that is slightly
  tacky to the touch. 3.  At the beep, add the raisins. 4. After the
  baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on cake rack, & allow
  to cool 1 hour before slicing. CRUST: Light -- BAKE CYCLE: Raisin/nut

      1 c  Starter
  1 1/2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Oil
    1/2 c  Sugar
     12    Apricots (dried), diced
    1/4 c  Walnuts, coarsely chopped
      2 c  Whole wheat flour
      4 c  Bread flour, bromated
      1 ts Salt
 
  Feed starter 1/2 C sugar, 1 C water and 1 T instant potato flakes
  once a week, stirring well. Let mixture sit in uncovered container
  all day to feed and grow. After 8 - 10 hours, remove 1 cup of starter
  to bake bread; return remainder of starter to refrigerator in loosely
  covered container.
  
  Combine starter, water, oil, sugar and apricots and mix well. Add
  walnuts and the whole wheat flour; blend together with a whisk. Add 2
  cups of the bread flour and mix again.
  
  Add the last 2 cups of the bread flour, combined with the salt, and
  mix again.
  
  The dough will be sticky and a little stiff.  Put the dough in a
  greased (or sprayed with Pam) bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Let
  rise until doubled in bulk.
  
  Punch down and divide into three equal pieces.  Put each piece into a
  greased loaf pan and let rise until they reach the tops of the pans.
  Bake at 350 degrees F. for 30 minutes or until browned and pulling
  away from the sides of the pans.
  
  Cathe's notes:
  
  *  Was originally Dot Howell's recipe.  You can substitute white corn
  syrup for part or all of the oil; the bread might cook more quickly
  and brown too soon if not watched carefully.  Can also substitute
      1/4 c  oatmeal for 1/4 C flour.
  
  *  Daddy speeds up the process; he feeds the starter and then puts it
  into a hot water bath for about an hour. While the starter sits in
  its bath, he mixes his ingredients for the bread. He uses 1 cup of
  the starter and lets the remainder sit outside for several hours. He
  makes his dough and puts it in a hot water bath to rise. When he
  punches it down, he puts the pans over a hot water bath to rise. He
  accomplishes the entire process in one day instead of two days.

      Title: DAK COCHU JANG BOEKUM (CHICKEN IN A HOT CHILI
 Categories: Chicken, Korean
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      2 lb Chicken parts; loose skin
           -& fat discarded
      5 tb Sugar
      1 tb Garlic; chopped
      1    Scallion; chopped
      1 tb Ginger, fresh; chopped
      2 tb Soy sauce
      5 tb Gochu jang; hot fermented
           -chili paste
      2 tb Korean sesame oil
      2 tb Toasted sesame seeds
    1/2 c  Water
 
  "Koreans in the southern part of the country like salty and chili-hot
  foods. The cities of Kwangju and Chongju in the southwest Korea,
  where I spent some culinary research time, are centers for this hot
  salty dish."
  
  1. Cut the chicken into 3-inch pieces. Divide the wings. Mix the
  parts with the sugar and marinate for 1 hour or more (the sugar is a
  tenderizer).
  
  2. Mix together all the other seasonings -- garlic, scallion, ginger,
  soy sauce, gochu jang, sesame oil and sesame seeds. Mix well, add to
  the chicken, and marinate for another hour.
  
  3. Pour the 1/2 cup of water into a pan and bring to a boil. Add the
  chicken and marinade and simmer, covered, over low heat for about 1/2
  hour, which is enough to cook the chicken and evaporate nearly all
  the liquid. Stir the mixture once or twice during this process.
  
  Serve warm with rice, salads and kimchi.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 c  Nonfat or lowfat milk
      3 tb Unflavored yogurt (we used
           Nonfat)
      1 c  All-purpose flour
 
  In a 1-quart pan over medium heat, heat milk to 90-100 degrees.
  Remove from heat and stir in yogurt. Place in a warm 3 to 6 cup
  glass, ceramic, plastic or stainless steel container with a tight
  lid. Cover and let stand in a warm place until mixture is the
  consistency of yogurt and a curd has formed. (You can test the
  mixture by tilting the container. If the mixture doesn't flow freely
  when the container is tilted, it's ready.) The curding process takes
  about 18 to 24 hours. You'll need to check it periodically. If some
  clear liquid rises to the top of the milk, stir it back in. NOTE: If
  the liquid turns pink, discard the batch and start again. Once the
  curd has formed, add the flour and stir until smooth. Cover again and
  let stand in a warm place until the mixture is full of bubbles and
  has a good sour smell. This should take about 2 to 5 days. Again, if
  some clear liquid rises to the top stir it back in. If the liquid
  turns pink, discard the batch and start again. When the mixture is
  ready, you can keep it covered and store it in the refrigerator until
  you need it. The recipe makes about
    1 1/3    cup starter.

           Additional wheat germ
           -=OR=- Oats, for top of loaf
 
  STIR YEAST AND HONEY into water; let stand until foamy, about 5
  minutes. For food processor fitted with metal blade or mixer with
  dough hook, put remaining bread ingredients into bowl. Turn machine
  on and combine mixture. With machine running, slowly add yeast
  mixture. Mix until dough cleans sides of bowl. If dough is too
  sticky, add more flour by the tablespoon, working it in before adding
  more. If dough is crumbly and dry, add more water by the teaspoon,
  working it in before adding more. Once desired consistency is
  reached, (moist but not sticky), mix dough until well kneaded,
  uniformly supple and elastic, about 40 seconds in food processor,
  about 6 minutes in mixer. Or by hand, put ingredients in large bowl.
  Mix well. Make well in center. Pour yeast mixture into well. Work
  yeast mixture into ingredients, then knead on floured board until
  smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Transfer dough to large plastic
  bag, squeeze out air and seal at top. Place dough in bowl. Let rise
  in warm spot until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. Oil a heat-proof glass
  pie plate. Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal. Punch dough down and shape
  into smooth ball. Place smooth side up in prepared plate. Cover
  loosely with oiled plastic. Let rise in warm spot until doubled,
  about 1 hour. Fifteen minutes before baking, put rack in center of
  oven; set oven at 375F. When loaf has doubled, brush top with egg
  white. Sprinkle with wheat germ and(or) rolled oats. Bake until loaf
  is deep brown (cover with foil last 5 minutes if too dark) and sounds
  hollow when rapped on bottom, about 35 minutes. Place loaf on rack to
  cool. Yield: 1 round loaf.

 Categories: Vegetables, East/orient
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Red or brown lentils,
           -yellow or green split peas,
           -or split, hulled mung beans
      4 c  Water
      2    Dried chiles, whole
    1/4 ts Turmeric
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Vegetable oil
    1/2 ts Cumin seeds
      1 c  Chopped onions
      1 ts Fresh ginger root,grate/peel
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
      1 ts Garam masala (optional)
 
  Wash lentils in several changes of cold water. In a medium pot, cover
  with the water and add the whole dried chiles, turmeric, and salt.
  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring often, until very
  tender. This will take about 30 minutes for red lintels, 45 minutes
  for peas, or an hour or more for mung beans. It may be necessary to
  add more water to prevent sticking,but only 1/2 cup at a time,
  because the final consistancy should be fairly thick. When the
  lentils are almost cooked, heat the oil in a small pan, add the cumin
  seeds, and cook for 10 or 15 seconds. Stir in the onions and ginger
  and cook until the onions begin to brown, about 5 or 10 minutes.
   When the lentils are tender, remove and discard the hot peppers.
  Stir in the onion mixture, lemon juice, garam masala, and salt to
  taste. Serve, passing additional garam masala to sprinkle on top, if
  desired.
  
  VARIATIONS Spinach Dal: Add 4 cups of chopped, fresh spinach to the
  onions after they have sauteed for about 5 minutes and then cook for
  5 minutes more. Tomato Dal: Add 1 cup chopped tomatos to the onions
  after they have sauteed for about 5 minutes and then cook for about 5
  minutes more. Spinach- Tomato Dal: Add both spinach and tomatoes.

      Title: DAL (LAUREL'S KITCHEN)
 Categories: Digest, Oct.
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Yellow or green split peas
      1 ts Salt
      1    Onion
    1/2    Green pepper
      1 ts Tumeric
    1/2 ts Curry powder
  1 1/2 ts Black mustard seeds
      1    Lemon juiced
 
  Boil the yellow split peas in 2 cups water for about 30
  minutes--until they are tender but not so long that they lose their
  shape. They should be rather dry, like mashed potatoes, but keep an
  eye on them. You may need to add a little more water along the way.
  Stir in salt. While the peas are cooking chop onion and green pepper.
  Combine with tumeric and curry powder and set aside.
  
  Heat up a heavy pan with a lid.  When it is very hot, add mustard
  seed and cover.  The seeds will pop noisily; shake the pan during
  this process to make sure they don't burn. (Traditionally, you do the
  seed popping in oil. It works without, but you need to be ready to
  add the next ingredients quickly.)  When the sound quiets down, add
  the onion mixture and a little water for saute.  Saute until onion is
  transparent and golden, and then stir this mixture into the peas
  along with the lemon juice. Serve with Chapatis (Indian bread) or
  over basmati rice, or whatever creative way you feel like doing.
  
  Makes about 4 cups.
  
  NOTE: I realize mustard seed is high fat ingredient, but it adds so
  much to the flavor, and so little fat over all, I kept it in. The
  recipe will work without it, though it's not quite the same.

  This savory bread is filled with meat, cheese, herbs and olives and is
  perfect for a trip to the ball park. It was named for Dale Murphy, a
  former player for the Atlanta Braves.
  
  IN FOOD PROCESSOR OR mixing bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups of the bread
  flour, yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water, butter and egg to the
  yeast mixture. Process or knead, adding enough flour in 1/2-cup
  increments, to make a soft dough. Knead until elastic and smooth, 1
  minute in a food processor or 10 minutes in a mixer or by hand. Place
  in oiled plastic bag or turn in greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap
  and let rest 15 minutes or, if you have time, let it double. On a
  lightly floured board, roll the dough to a 14-by-10-inch rectangle.
  Place on a greased baking sheet. Spread pesto sauce down the center
  third of dough, lengthwise. Dot with olives, mozzarella and
  Garlic-and-Herb Cheese. Top with ham strips and sprinkle with peppers
  and sun-dried tomatoes.
  
  TO ENCASE FILLING, cut the unfilled dough diagonally on each side to
  1-inch strips down the length of each side of the dough. Criss-cross
  the strips, bringing one strip over the center from one side, then a
  strip from the other, until the length of the filling is encased with
  the overlapping strips. Let double, uncovered, in a warm place for
  half hour. Preheat oven to 400F. Combine egg and water and brush the
  glaze on the loaf. Bake until done, about 25 minutes. Remove from pan
  and cool on wire rack before slicing. Serve warm or at room
  temperature.
  
  HOMEMADE GARLIC AND HERB CHEESE: Blend the cream cheese, butter and
  garlic in a food processor until smooth. Add the herbs and combine.
  Salt and pepper to taste. Can be made one week ahead, covered
  tightly, and refrigerated. Makes about 2 1/2 to 3 cups.

  other marinade ingredients in a blender and puree. Place the brisket
  in a plastic bag and pour the marinade over it. Refrigerate the
  brisket overnight.
     Before you begin to barbecue, take the brisket from the
  refrigerator. Drain and discard the marinade. Pat the brisket down
  with all but 2 tbsps of the remaining rub, coating the slab well. Let
  the brisket sit at room temperature for about 45 minutes.
     Prepare the smoker for barbecuing, bringing the temperature up to
  200 to 220 degrees F.
     Transfer the brisket to the smoker and cook for 3 hours. Place the
  meat on a sheet of heavy-duty foil, sprinkle it with the rest of the
  rub, and close the foil tightly. Cook for an additional 1-1/2 to 2
  hours, until well-done and tender.
     Let the brisket sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. Trim any
  excess fat and slice the brisket thinly against the grain, changing
  direction as the grain changes...". Serve with your favorite barbecue
  sauce.

      Title: DAMPER
 Categories: Breads, Australian
      Yield: 1 Damper
 
  2 1/2 c  Flour, self-raising
      1 ts Salt
      1 ts Butter
      1 ts Sugar
      1 c  Milk (or use about
           -1/2 C of powdered milk
           -and about 1 C water)
 
  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Mix together the dry ingredients and
  the butter.   Add the liquid and mix well. Knead for about 5 minutes
  (if you don't know about kneading, look in a good cookery book with
  plenty of pictures, it's difficult to describe in words).
  
  Shape into a flattened ball and place on a greased and floured baking
  sheet or in a greased and floured round cake tin (I recommend the
  latter, about 7 or 8 inch diameter, as it gives a better shape). Bake
  for 30 minutes. Use a Dutch oven if you are cooking in an open fire,
  and use your experience as to cooking time.
  
  Serve in moderately thick slices while still fairly hot. I'm told that
  golden syrup (a treacle-like substance made as a by-product of cane
  sugar refining) is the traditional thing to spread on it, and that
  goes well. Jam is good, too.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Bread as made by drovers in the outback -- I don't know how many
  of you realize it, but there is a wealth of TV programmes about
  cooking from around the world. We are lucky in that Australia's SBS
  network (Special Broadcasting Service "multi-cultural television")
  has a regular slot for food and wine at a convenient time on Saturday
  evenings. Over the last couple of years we have seen series on
  French, Indian, Chinese, English, Vegetarian, Australian and Sri
  Lankan cookery, among others. If you're missing out, why not call
  your local station?
  
  This recipe comes from a series called "Australian Tableland".
  Traditionally, damper should be cooked in the coals of a camp fire,
  but the temperature in an oven is much more consistent! This recipe
  has the advantages of being simple and, with ordinary care, reliable.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  10 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking.
  : Precision:  measure carefully.

      Title: DAMPFNUDLE (YEAST DUMPLINGS)
 Categories: German
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    500 g  Flour (4 1/2 cups less 1
           -Tbsp)
    1/4 l  Milk (1 cup plus 1 Tbsp)
     40 g  [fresh] yeast (1.4 oz)
      1 ds Salt
    150 g  Butter OR, better yet,
           -clarified butter (2/3 cup)
      1    To 2 eggs
 
  Heat the milk a bit and then dissolve the yeast in it. Make a well in
  the flour, and pour the yeast mixture into it. Let rest for 1/2 hour.
  Then, add the remaining milk and the salt, and knead well. Vigorously
  beat the dough until it forms bubbles, then cover, and in a warm
  spot, let rest for 1 hour.  Cut off fist size pieces, and - on a
  floured pastry board ~ let these pieces rise one more time, for
  another 15 minutes.
  
  In a wide pot, melt the fat, and then add warm, salted water to a
  depth of about 3/4 inch.  Add the dumplings, arranged in one layer,
  touching each other. Put a lid on the pot, and additionally seal the
  edges ~ where the lid rests on the pot - with damp cloths in order to
  keep the steam inside. Bake at low heat.  The dumplings should be
  done in about 20 minutes, and have the highly desirable 'Schuepet'
  (hard, brown crust) on the bottom.
  
  'Dampfnudle' may be served sour, with sauerkraut, or sweet, with
  stewed fruit or vanilla sauce.
  
  Variation: DAMPFNUDLE IN DER SCHLEIFERBRUEH* (Steamed Dumplings in
  Thin Gravy):
  
  Prepare as for regular 'Dampfnudle', but prior to arranging them in
  the pot, thoroughly dust the bottom of each dumpling with flour.
  During the steaming process, the flour and water will form a whitish
  gravy that is called 'Schleiferbrueh'.
  
  [*Note: In the olden days, scissors-and-knife grinders would go from
  house to house, wheeling a little cart with a round, treadle-operated
  whetstone. The bottom of the whetstone would be in a bit of water,
  which - with the treadle turning the stone - would keep the grinding
  surface wet. As the grinder sharpened knives and scissors, a bit of
  the whetstone would wear off, and this somewhat cloudy water was the
  original application of the term 'Schleiferbrueh'. K.B.]
  
  Serves 4.

      Title: DAMSON CHEESE (ZWETSCHGENMUS)
 Categories: German
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      5 lb Plums
      1 c  Water
 
  Pit the damsons and mince them (or put them through the meat grinder
  or puree in the blender or food processor), retaining as much of the
  juice as possible.  Add a little water to the minced damsons and the
  juice and slowly bring to a boil' reduce the fruit pulp over low heat
  for several hours, but do not stir or the damson pulp is quite likely
  to scorch on the bottom.
  
  When the pulp has thickened somewhat, it will have to be stirred -
  continuously - for several hours, until it is literally thick enough
  that a spoon will stand up in it. It may sputter and bubble during
  this stage. (In former days, it was usual for several families to
  convene in the village washhouse for a cooperatove 'Zwetschgenmus'
  cooking session, with story-telling and other impromptu
  entertainments to give encouragement to the stirrers.)
  
  When the damson cheese has sufficiently thickened, transfer it to
  stoneware crocks and bake in the oven until a dry crust has formed on
  top. The damson cheese will keep better if a piece of parchment paper
  that has been soaked in rum is placed on top of this crust before the
  crock is sealed with plastic wrap (formerly a piece of linen or
  parchment was used). A good imported product is available on the
  American market under the name of 'Pflaumenmus' (pronounced
  Flaumenmoose).

      2 ts Salt
 
  :       Flour the pork and brown it in the drippings in a skillet.
  Remove pork to a large stew pot, 3 to 5 quart size. Add onions to
  drippings in the skillet and cook until the onion is translucent.
  :       Add the onions to the pork.  Cut the chiles into 1 inch
  slices; add to the meat and onions in the pot.
  :       Add the remaining ingredients and cook over medium heat for
  about 1 hour, until the stew is slightly thickened.
  :       If you prefer the all day method, follow the same directions
  except put the ingredients in a crock pot. Cook on low for 10-12
  hoursor high for 5 hours.
  :       I like using fresh jalepenos. Depending on where the chiles
  are from you can have a rather firey brew!!! Make sure you have
  plenty of flour tortillas handy, you will not want to miss one tasty
  drop.

      Title: DAN'S CREAMY CHICKEN & PASTA
 Categories: Pasta, Poultry, Chicken, Main dish
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 lb Thin spaghetti (dry)
      2 qt Chicken broth
    3/4 c  Sliced celery
    3/4 c  Slivered onions
      1 c  Cooked chicken, diced into
           Bite-sized pieces
      4 tb Butter (up to 8 tb can be
           Used for a richer product)
      3 tb Grated parm or romano cheese
      1 c  Milk
      2 tb Flour
           Salt and Pepper to taste
 
  1)  Bring the broth to a boil in a large pan.  While it is coming up
  to the boil, add the celery, onion and chicken.
  
  2)  Break the thin spaghetti into smaller pieces, about 3 or 4 inches
  in length.  Drop them into the boiling broth.
  
  3)  Cook the spaghetti until done.  Most of the broth will be
  absorbed by the pasta.  If it gets too dry add a little water.
  
  4)  In a small bowl, wisk together the milk and the flour until the
  flour is completely incorporated.  Pour it into the boiling spaghetti
  pot and stir to completely mix.
  
  5)  As soon as the sauce has thickened, shut off the heat and
  immediately add the grated cheese.
  
  6)  Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper according to taste.
  This tasting is very important because some of the initial broth
  which you used will have varying amounts of salt.  I happened to use
  a homemade broth which had a little salt in it and I needed to add
  salt. If you use a canned broth, it will probably not require as much
  salt as most canned broths have plenty to begin with.

  Contributed to the echo by: Dan Perez Dan's Spicy Smoked Spareribs To
  get started, place a handful of hickory or mesquite chips into cold
  water and set aside. Parboil rib sections in boiling water for about
  ten minutes. (This partially cooks them and renders much of the fat.)
  Remove rib sections and set on wire rack to cool. Combine dry
  ingredients in a bowl and blend well with a fork. When rib sections
  are cool, rub the dry ingredient mixture into the meat. Stack rib
  sections, seal in aluminum foil and let them sit in the refrigerator
  for about two hours.
  
  After two hours, start the coals in your smoker. Combine ingredients
  for basting sauce in a blender and blend until smooth. Transfer the
  basting sauce to a saucepan and heat over low heat until it begins to
  bubble. If you prefer for the basting sauce to be thicker, mix 2
  tablespoons of cornstarch with 1/4 cup of cold water, and mix a
  little of the cornstarch mixture into the basting sauce a bit at a
  time to until desired consistency is achieved.
  
  When the coals are uniform gray, scatter a few of the wet wood chips
  over them. Rub grill with a paper towel dipped in vegetable oil.
  Brush ribs with basting sauce and place them on the grill. Cover with
  smoker lid (leave vents about half-open). Grill the ribs for about an
  hour, turning about every fifteen minutes and basting as you turn
  them. Add wood chips to the coals as necessary to maintain smoke.
  
  Serve ribs with warm basting sauce.

      1 tb Minced lemon grass

      2 tb Chinese rice wine or dry
           -sherry
     12 lg Or jumbo shrimp, preferably
           -whole
    1/2    Orange or apple
           Coriander sprigs, lime
           -wedges for garnish
 
  I *think* this came from Sunset Magazine.  There's nothing hot in the
  ingredient list, but it would be real easy to put some cayenne or
  mashed up chili peppers in the marinade. Probably more authentic as
  well.
  
  This attractive Thai presentation looks best with shrimp with their
  heads still attached.  Try it with large tiger prawns or fresh
  carids. Pound the garlic, shallot, galangal and lemon grass to a
  paste in a mortar with a pinch of salt.  Transfer to a shallow bowl
  and stir in the lemon juice, soy sauce and wine.
  
  Using a small knife or scissors, split the shrimp shells down the
  back, but leave attached.  (If the heads are present, carefully
  separate the shell where the tail joins the head, then split the tail
  shell open.) Devein if necessary.  Toss in the marinade and let stand
  for 30 minutes to 3 hours.
  
  Thread single shrimp lengthwise on skewers, starting at the tail end
  and coming out through the head.  Push the skewer on through until
  the pointed end extends at least 3 inches beyond the shrimp. Handling
  by the pointed ends, grill until the meat is opaque.  To serve, place
  the orange or apple cut side down on a plate and insert the pointed
  ends of the skewers. Garnish with coriander sprigs and lime wedges.
  
  Serves 4 as an appetizer or side dish.

 Categories: Pasta
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2 c  Dandelion greens
      2    Eggs
  1 1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Salt
 
  Some people find dandelion greens too strong simply added to a salad,
  but here is a basic pasta recipe that uses them to the best effect.
  It also works for other greens; beet greens, arugula, orach, or
  chicory. It is so tasty that it needs only butter and grated Asiago
  cheese. When making the pasta, adjust the amount of flour to the
  moisture of the greens.
  
  DIRECTIONS: =========== 1.) In a blender put dandelion greens and
  eggs, blend until smooth.
  
  2.) Transfer to a bowl, add salt and start adding flour while beating
  with a spoon.  Keep adding until dough is stiff.
  
  3.) Turn out onto floured surface and knead until smooth
  (approximately 5 minutes).
  
  4.) Roll out with rolling pin to 1/8"-1/4" thickness or thinner.
  
  5.) Allow to stand and dry 1 hour, then cut into strips.
  
  6.) Drop into boiling water and cook 1-2 minutes.

      Title: DANDELION JELLY
 Categories: Desserts, Jams
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      1 qt Dandelion blossoms
      2 qt Water
      2 tb Fresh lemon juice
  1 3/4 oz Powdered fruit pectin
  5 1/2 c  Sugar
 
  Pick bright, fresh dandelion blossoms and pack the quart container
  pretty tightly.  This is going to require a lot of dandelion
  blossoms! Rinse quickly in cold water to remove any insects/dirt on
  the petals. Don't leave the blossoms in the water for very long
  though, as they will be a little the worse for wear.
  
  Next, pull up a chair somewhere comfortable, as this part is going to
  take awhile...Snip off the stem and green collar under each blossom,
  so that only the petals are left. This takes about four hours!
  
  In an enamel saucepan, boil the dandelion petals in water for 3
  minutes, or a little longer, until the water takes on their color. (I
  boiled the petals for 4 minutes until I liked the color better.)
  
  Cool and strain, pressing against the petals with your fingers to
  extract all of the dandelion juice.  (Or you can cheat and line a
  sieve with moistened cheesecloth and strain it that way.)
  
  Measure out 3 cups of dandelion liquid.  Add the lemon juice and fruit
  pectin.  Stir to combine.
  
  Bring to a boil, using a large kettle.  Add the sugar, stirring to mix
  well. Continue stirring and boil the mixture for 2 and 1/2 minutes.
  
  Pour into hot sterilized jelly jars and seal.  Process for five
  minutes in a boiling water bath.
  
  Yield:  Five 1/2 pint jars.

  Carefully wash and prepare the dandelion as you would lettuce. Roll in
  cloth and pat dry. Then put into a salad bowl and place in warm
  place. Cut bacon in small pieces, fry quickly and drop over the
  dandelions. Put the butter and cream into a skillet and melt over a
  slow fire. Beat eggs, add salt, pepper, sugar and vinegar and mix
  with slightly warm cream mixture. Pour into skillet and under
  increased heat, stir until dressing becomes thick like custard. Take
  off and pour piping hot over dandelion. Stir thoroughly. Never use
  dandelion after it has begun to flower, for then it is apt to be
  bitter. Source: Pennsylvania Dutch Cook Book - Fine Old Recipes,

MMMMM---------------------------CRUST--------------------------------
     11 oz Pumpernickel Bread; *
    1/2 c  Butter; No Margarine
    1/4 c  Sugar; Granulated

MMMMM-------------------------CHEESE PIE------------------------------
      2 ea Unflavored Gelatin;Envelopes
    1/2 c  Cold Water
      4 oz Cream Cheese
      4 oz Danish Blue Cheese
      1 c  Heavy Cream
      1 lb Seedless Green Grapes
 
  *    Use 1 loaf (11 oz) of thin sliced pumpernickel bread. NOTE:
  Since this is a Cheese pie rather than a cake, you will need one
         9-inch pie tin.
  
  First prepare the crust.  Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F, then dry
  the bread slices in the oven until they are hard enough to crumble
  easily, (about 20 to 25 minutes). Meanwhile melt the butter. Crush
  the bread, making about 1 1/2 cups of crumbs.  Add the butter and the
  sugar and mix very well.  Press the crumbs into the pie tin. Raise
  the oven temperature to 35o degrees F. and bake the crust fro 15
  minutes. Allow to cool before filling.  Then prepare the filling. In
  a medium-sized saucepan, combine the gelatin with the water and cook
  over medium high heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture is
  clear (about 6 to 8 minutes). Cool. In a large mixing bowl, beat the
  cream cheese until light and smooth. Mash the blue cheese well and
  combine with the cream cheese. Pour the gelatin mixture into the bowl
  with the cheese and mix well. Whip the cream until stiff and fold
  into the cheese mixture.  Pour the filling gently into the prepared
  crust. Press the grapes upright into the pie, leaving the tops
  showing. Chill the pie for several hours or until set.
  
  NOTE:
  
  Since there is no sugar in this recipe, all the sweetness comes from
  the grapes, it is not as sweet as a cheesecake. If it is too tart for
  you, add just a little sugar, but it is well liked by most as an
  appetizer without any sugar added.

  onto a warm platter and arrange eggs on top. Garnish with the lettuce
  and tomatoes. Serve with coarse salt, if you wish. Makes 4 to 6
  servings. Biksemad (bick-sa-mod) is the Danish name of this delicious
  beef and potatoe hash. It makes a delightful entree for a casual
  supper or brunch. From the "Sunset Scandinavian Cook Book", published

      Title: DANISH PASTRY
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4    To 6 cups flour
      2 pk Dry yeast or 1 ounce fresh
           -yeast
      3 tb Sugar
      1 ts Salt
      3    Whole eggs or 6 egg yolks
      1 ts Grated orange rind
    1/4 ts Ground cardamom seeds
           -(optional)
      1 ts Vanilla
  1 1/4 c  Cold milk (approximately)
      2 c  Butter, firm, but not ice
           -cold
 
  When making Danish pastry it is important to keep the dough very
  cold. In shaping small pastries, it is sometimes necessary to
  re-chill partially shaped dough until it is firm enough for the job
  to be completed. When you first make the pastry, be careful to follow
  all the rules. Don't make it in the summertime unless your kitchen is
  air conditioned. After you gain experience you may attempt short cuts
  such as rolling out and folding the dough twice in succession without
  re-chilling. Another way of shortening the process is by placing the
  dough in the freezer between rollings. Usually 10 minutes in the
  freezer is suffiecient. When you use this short cut, be careful not
  to freeze the dough solid. The shaped pastries can also be chilled in
  the freezer. They can even be baked frozen if extra baking time is
  allowed. Any unbaked yeast pastries, however, should never be kept
  frozen for more than a week or so; and it is preferable to bake anish
  pastry within a day or two after it has been shaped.
  
  Place 4 cups flour in large bowl.  Reserve remaining flour for
  rolling. Make a well in center of bowl.
  
  If dry yeast is used, see directions on package.  If fresh yeast is
  used, cream it with sugar and salt to make a syrup. Add egg yolks or
  whole eggs, grated orange rind, ground cardamom seeds, and vanilla.
  
  Pour yeast mixture into well.  Add one cup milk and 1/4 cup butter
  cut into pieces.  Mix with finger tips, adding more milk if necessary
  to make a medium-soft dough. Knead dough in bowl for 5 minutes, or
  until it is smooth but not elastic.  Flour it and let rest in
  refrigerator for 30 minutes.
  
  While dough is resting, form remaining butter into a flattened brick.
  Using some of the reserved flour on wax paper or pastry cloth, roll
  out butter into a square about 1/3 inch thick. Use plenty of flour
  under and on top of butter to keep it from sticking. Loosen it
  frequently as you rol. Cut the square in 2 pieces. Place in
  refrigerator between sheets of wax paper.
  
  Roll out dough on well-floured cloth to make a rectangle 3 times
  longer than wide and about 1/3 inch thick. Brush excess flour from
  dough. Place a piece of butter in center. Fold one end of dough over
  butter. Place remaining butter on top.  Fold second end over the
  butter. Press edges together.
  
  Turn dough, changing its position so that the short ends are parallel
  with the edge of table nearest you. Roll out on well-floured cloth,
  using a firm, even motion to spread butter together with dough. Try
  to work quickly, but check frequently underneat the dough to be sure
  it isn't sticking.  Roll out a rectangele 3 times longer than wide,
  about 1/3 inch thick.  rush excess flour from surface. Fold both ends
  of dough to meet in center.  Press edges together, then fold in half
  as if closing a book, which will make 4 layers of dough. Flour dough.
  Place on a cooky sheet. Cover with aluminum foil. Refrigerate for 1/2
  hour.
  
  Repeat rolling and folding dough 3 more times, chilling it 20 minutes
  between rollings.  Be sure to change position of dough each time so
  that the short ends of dough are parallel with the edge of the table
  nearest you when you start rolling.
  
  After the final folding, chill dough at least 3 hours before shaping
  and baking.

      Title: DANISH PASTRY - DANSK WIENERBROD
 Categories: Ethnic, Desserts
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 c  Flour
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Sugar
  2 1/4 oz Yeast cakes
      1 c  Milk
      1    Egg
  1 1/2 c  Butter
 
  Sift flour and mix with sugar and salt. Mix yeast with a little cold
  milk. Add this, the rest of the milk and the beaten egg to flour and
  sugar. Beat well until smooth with a wooden spoon.
  
  Roll out the dough on baking board to 1 finger thickness. Spread small
  pieces of butter on 2/3. of the dough. The butter must have same
  consistency as the dough; if it is too soft it melts into the dough.
  Fold together into three layers like folding a napkin, first the part
  without butter. Roll out and fold again. Repeat three or four times.
  
  Leave in cold place 1/2 hour. This is the dough with which many
  different kinds of Danish pastry is made. When pastry is shaped,
  place on baking sheet and leave in cold place to rise for 15-20 min.,
  then brush with egg white and bake in a fast oven until golden brown.
  
  Cocks' Combs (Hanekamme). Roll out dough to finger thickness and
  spread with a paste made of equal parts of butter and sugar, then cut
  into square pieces 4" x 4". Place filling across middle and fold
  over. Press the edges firmly together and make 4-5 deep slashes in
  this side. Let rise, brush with egg white and spread with chopped
  almonds and sugar.
  
  Spandauers. Roll our dough, spread with paste and cut as above. Place
  filling in middle. Fold corners to the center and press down. After
  baking drop 1 teaspoon of jelly in the center and spread with
  frosting of confectioner's sugar and water.
  
  Chocolate Buns (Cremeboller). Roll out dough, spread with paste and
  cut as above. Place filling of vanilla creme in middle, fold corners
  to center, forming dough as a ball and place upside down on baking
  sheet. After baking spread with frosting of con- fectioner's sugar,
  cocoa and water.
  
  As filling may be used apple sauce, jelly, prunes, vanilla creme or
  almond paste:
  
  Vanilla Creme. Mix 1 egg yolk, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 table- spoon
  flour and 3/4 cup milk and cook until thick. Take off, add 1/2
  teaspoon vanilla extract and cool stirring occasionally.
  
  Almond Paste. Cream 1/2 cup butter, add 1/4 lb. ground, blanched
  almonds and 1/2 cup sugar and well until smooth. Another kind of
  almond paste without butter is made of: 1/4 ]b. almonds, 1/2 cup
  sugar and 3 egg whites. Work well together until smooth.

MMMMM------------------ROMULAN LAMB AND LENTILS-----------------------
      1    6 to 7 lb leg of lamb
           Flour
      1    Onion; cut into chunks
           Salt and pepper
      2 tb Cooking oil
      1 c  Onion; chopped
      2 c  Lentils
     10 oz Beef broth
     10 oz Water
      1    Bay leaf
      1 c  Green onions; sliced
    1/2 c  Chopped parsley
    1/3 c  Pan gravy for roast lamb
      1    Roasting bag
 
  About 4 hours before you want to serve, get the leg of lamb ready and
  put it in the oven; Preheat the oven to 350 degrees, dust the inside
  of the baking bag with flour, put in the large onion as a layer of
  chunks and put the leg of lamb in on top of that. Sprinkle the lamb
  with salt and pepper and close the bag. Poke some holes in the top of
  the bag. If you wish, stick a meat thermometer into the thickest part
  of the roast, right through the bag so you can read the dial: 160 to
  190 degrees covers the range from moderately rare to well done. About
  40 minutes before serving time, get the lentils going. Heat the oil

  SAUCE: 6 oz BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE, -FINELY CHOPPED 2/3 c HEAVY CREAM
  2 tb LIGHT CORN SYRUP 2 ts VANILLA EXTRACT Make the dark chocolate
  mousse: Lightly grease the bottom and sides of a 9 1/4-by-5 1/4-by-2
  3/4-inch metal loaf pan. Line the pan with plastic wrap so that the
  plastic extends about 1 inch beyond the rim of the pan. Place the
  chocolate in a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade.
  Process for 30 to 45 seconds, until finely chopped. In a small
  saucepan, combine the milk, sugar and salt. Cook over medium heat,
  stirring with a wooden spoon, until the sugar dissolves and the
  mixture comes to a gentle boil. With the motor of the food processor
  running, pour the hot milk mixture through the feed tube. Process for
  15 to 25 seconds, until the chocolate is completely melted. Scrape
  down the sides of the work bowl. Add the oil, rum and vanilla and
  process for 15 to 25 seconds, until the mixture is smooth and creamy.
  Scrape the chocolate mixture into a large bowl. Let the chocolate
  mixture stand for a few minutes, until tepid. In the chilled 4
  1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer, using the wire whip
  attachment, whip the cream at medium-high speed until soft mounds
  barely start to form and the cream is still pourable. Do not overwhip
  the cream. Using a large rubber spatula, gently fold one-third of the
  whipped cream into the tepid chocolate mixture to lighten it. Fold in
  the remaining whipped cream. Do not overfold the mousse, or it will
  become grainy. Scrape the chocolate mousse into the prepared loaf pan
  and smooth the top with the rubber spatula. Wrap the loaf pan in
  plastic wrap and aluminum foil. Freeze the terrine for at least 6
  hours or overnight, until firm. (The terrine can be prepared ahead to
  this point and kept frozen for up to 1 month. ) Continued.......

      Title: DARK CHOCOLATE MOUSSE~ THE ROYAL ORLEANS
 Categories: Puddings, Desserts
      Yield: 12 Servings
 
           Chocolate Mousse
     12 oz Top-quality semi-sweet
           Chocolate (the better
           The chocolate, the better
           The mousse)
      1 c  Whipping cream
    1/4 c  Hot coffee
    1/4 c  Hot water
      3    Egg yolks, beaten
      1 ts Vanilla
      5    Egg whites
    1/3 c  Sugar
 
  For dark chocolate mousse, as was served at the Royal Orleans (and was
  considered to be the best chocolate mousse anyone had ever tasted),
  use the list of ingredients below and follow the same procedure as
  above, except using hot coffee instead of brandy, and whisking the
  vanilla into he egg yolk-chocolate mixture instead of into the whites.
  
  Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over low heat. It's a good idea
  to stand over the chocolate while it is melting and stir it until it's
  completely melted, then take it off the heat immediately.
  
  Whip the cream and set aside. Pour the hot coffee and hot water
  slowly into a bowl with the egg yolks, whisking briskly as you go
  until completely mixed. Add the vanilla to the egg yolks.
  
  Whisk in the melted chocolate. Keep whisking even after the mixture is
  completely combined; this will help to cool the chocolate. Whip the
  egg whites and the sugar until peaking but not dry.
  
  Fold the egg-white meringue into the chocolate mixture carefully with
  a wooden spoon.
  
  Fold in the whipped cream. THIS IS THE MOST CRUCIAL PART OF THE
  RECIPE. The key to a great chocolate mousse is that you can't
  incorporate hot melted chocolate into whipped cream. The chocolate
  mixture must be cool to the touch or the cream will break. Lightly
  blend the two mixtures until uniform.
  
  This mousse is at its best cloudlike texture right after
  incorporating the whipped cream. But at Andrea's, they pipe it into
  dish-shaped champagne glasses, sprinkle chocolate shavings and
  powdered sugar over the top, and refrigerate. This causes the mousse
  to set, which gives it a different, heavier texture. Walt MM

      Title: DARK CHRISTMAS CAKE
 Categories: Cakes, Christmas
      Yield: 50 Servings
 
      1 lb Blanched almonds
      3 lb Seedless raisins
      2 lb Currants
      1 lb Candied cherries,
           Cut in half
      1 lb Dried figs, chopped
      1 lb Dates, cut up
  1 1/2 lb Chopped mixed candied peels
      1 lb Candied pineapple, cut up
      1 c  All-purpose flour
      3 c  Soft butter
      3 c  Brown sugar, packed
     12 lg Egg yolks
  5 1/2 c  Sifted all-purpose flour
      1 ts Salt
      2 ts Cinnamon
      2 ts Mace
      2 ts Allspice
      2 ts Nutmeg
      1 ts Cloves
      3 ts Baking soda
    3/4 c  Prune juice
    1/4 c  Brandy
     12 lg Egg whites
 
  This recipe makes a very large amount (about 28 cups) of fruit cake
  batter and can be baked in a number of different sizes of pan. If you
  want to make several small cakes for gifts you can divide the batter
  among 9 8x4x3 inch loaf pans using a generous 3 cups of batter for
  each. Or if you wish to use larger loaf pans you can put the batter
  in 6 9x5x3 inch pans using a generous 4 1/2 cups batter in each.
  Bundt pans make attractive cakes and this amount of batter is enough
  for 3 12 cup Bundt pans using a generous 9 cups of batter in each. If
  you use 10-inch tube pans you can make 2 cakes using 12 cups of
  batter for each and an 8x4x2 1/2 inch loaf pan with the remaining
  batter. Of course you can also use any combination of these sizes.
  For example, you can make a large cake in a Bundt pan, two 9x5x3-in
  loaves and three 8x4x3-inch loaves. If you wish you can prepare half
  the batter and bake it in three 9x5x3-inch loaf pans or in one 12-cup
  Bundt pan and one 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. Line greased pans with greased
  heavy brown paper, except for the Bundt pan which should be greased
  and floured. COMBINE nuts and fruit in a very large bowl or roasting
  pan. Add 1 cup of flour and toss by hand to coat fruit with flour.
  CREAM butter well ( you can use your electric mixer for this part of
  the recipe). Add sugar and beat until fluffy. Beat in egg yolks.
  Transfer mixture to a large bowl. Sift 5 1/2 cups flour with salt,
  spices and soda and add to creamed mixture alternately with prune
  juice and brandy. Mix with a wooden spoon. Add this mixture to the
  fruit and nuts and blend well.The easiest way to blend this large
  amount of mixture is with your hands. Beat egg whites until stiff and
  fold into mixture. MEASURE into prapared pans and press well into the
  corners. Heat oven to 275'F. Bake cakes in 8x4x3-inch pans for about
  3 hours, in 9x5x3-inch pans or Bundt pans for about 3 hours and 15
  minutes and in 10-inch tube pans about 3 1/2 hours or until a
  toothpick stuck in the center comes out clean. Let stand in pans a
  few minutes, then turn out on racks and cool. Strip off paper and
  wrap cakes in cheesecloth dampened with brandy and then in foil and
  store in a cool place. MAKES 15 LBS OF FRUIT CAKE.

 Categories: Seafood, Thailand, Thai
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
           Stephen Ceideburg
     10    White peppercorns
           Mace
      1 ts Thai shrimp paste
      3    To 5 long red dried chillies
      4    Cloves shallots
    1/2    Stalk lemon grass
      1 ts Galangal
    1/2 ts Kaffir Lime Zest
      1 tb Chopped Coriander Root
    1/2 ts Salt
    250 ml Coconut Cream
      2 tb To 3 tb Red Curry Paste
      1 tb Fish Sauce
    1/2 tb Palm Sugar
     24    Coffin Bay Scallops
    125 ml Coconut Milk
      5    Kaffir Lime Leaves
      1 lg Fresh Red Chilli, Julienned
      2 tb Coriander Leaves
           Jasmine Rice
 
  A colleague who recently visited the Darley Street Thai at its new
  location in Bayswater Road, Kings Cross, described this dish as
  "exquisite". Though the recipe may seem dauntingly lengthy, most of
  it is simply a long list of ingredients for red curry paste, which
  can be made in quantity and stored in a container in the fridge for
  3-4 weeks for further use. Frozen kaffir limes can be bought very
  cheaply in good Asian stores, where the rest of the ingredients
  listed should also be avail- able. Grate the limes for zest while
  they are stir frozen.
  
  In a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, grind to a powder 10 white
  peppercorns and a few sheaves of mace. Roast 1 teaspoon of Thai shrimp
  paste by zapping it in a microwave oven or putting it on a little
  piece of foil under the grill.
  
  Put the pepper-mace mixture and the shrimp paste in a blender (David
  recommends a blender but some of us will have to make do with a food
  processor or the mortar and pestle) and add 3- 5 long red dried
  chillies, deseeded, washed and chopped, 4 cloves of true shallots,
  (or substitute the same quantity of Spanish onion), 1/2 stalk of
  lemon grass, sliced, 1 teaspoon galangal. peeled and chopped, 1/2
  teaspoon kaffir lime zest, 1 tablespoon of coriander root, scraped
  and chopped, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a little water. Process to a
  very fine paste. This may take up to 10 minutes. Transfer to a
  storage jar.
  
  In a medium-size pan, boil 250 mL coconut cream over high heat,
  stirring constantly, until the oil separates out, about 3-5 minutes.
  (If using canned coconut cream, don't shake the can -use the solid
  mass of coconut at the top of the can, plus as much of the rest as
  you need to make up 250mL. If it doesn't separate within 5 minutes,
  add a tablespoon of oil.) Add 2-3 tablespoons of red curry paste and
  fry for 5 minutes, stirring, until fra- grant. Add 1 tablespoon fish
  sauce, 1/2 tablespoon palm sugar and fry until colour deepens. Add 24
  Coffin Bay scallops (12 if other dishes will be served
  simultaneously) and 125 mL coconut milk. Check for sweet-sour
  balance. Throw in 5 kaffir lime leaves, shredded, 1 large fresh red
  chilli, julienned, and 2 tablespoons of either coriander or basil
  leaves. Serve with jasmine rice.

      1 tb Chopped Coriander Root
    1/2 ts Salt
    250 ml Coconut Cream
      2 tb To 3 tb Red Curry Paste
      1 tb Fish Sauce
    1/2 tb Palm Sugar
     24    Coffin Bay Scallops
    125 ml Coconut Milk
      5    Kaffir Lime Leaves

      2 tb Coriander Leaves
           Jasmine Rice
 
  A colleague who recently visited the Darley Street Thai at its new
  location in Bayswater Road, Kings Cross, described this dish as
  "exquisite". Though the recipe may seem dauntingly lengthy, most of
  it is simply a long list of ingredients for red curry paste, which
  can be made in quantity and stored in a container in the fridge for
  3-4 weeks for further use. Frozen kaffir limes can be bought very
  cheaply in good Asian stores, where the rest of the ingredients
  listed should also be avail- able. Grate the limes for zest while
  they are stir frozen.
  
  In a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, grind to a powder 10 white
  peppercorns and a few sheaves of mace. Roast 1 teaspoon of Thai shrimp
  paste by zapping it in a microwave oven or putting it on a little
  piece of foil under the grill.
  
  Put the pepper-mace mixture and the shrimp paste in a blender (David
  recommends a blender but some of us will have to make do with a food
  processor or the mortar and pestle) and add 3- 5 long red dried
  chillies, deseeded, washed and chopped, 4 cloves of true shallots,
  (or substitute the same quantity of Spanish onion), 1/2 stalk of
  lemon grass, sliced, 1 teaspoon galangal. peeled and chopped, 1/2
  teaspoon kaffir lime zest, 1 tablespoon of coriander root, scraped
  and chopped, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a little water. Process to a
  very fine paste. This may take up to 10 minutes. Transfer to a
  storage jar.
  
  In a medium-size pan, boil 250 mL coconut cream over high heat,
  stirring constantly, until the oil separates out, about 3-5 minutes.
  (If using canned coconut cream, don't shake the can -use the solid
  mass of coconut at the top of the can, plus as much of the rest as
  you need to make up 250mL. If it doesn't separate within 5 minutes,
  add a tablespoon of oil.) Add 2-3 tablespoons of red curry paste and
  fry for 5 minutes, stirring, until fra- grant. Add 1 tablespoon fish
  sauce, 1/2 tablespoon palm sugar and fry until colour deepens. Add 24
  Coffin Bay scallops (12 if other dishes will be served
  simultaneously) and 125 mL coconut milk. Check for sweet-sour
  balance. Throw in 5 kaffir lime leaves, shredded, 1 large fresh red
  chilli, julienned, and 2 tablespoons of either coriander or basil
  leaves. Serve with jasmine rice.

      1 pt Light Rum
      1 qt Strawberry juice

  NOTE: Orange juice and wedges and pineapple juice and chunks can be

  I got this recipe from a lady who is now in her 90's and still going
  strong. She said this recipe came from the 1920's sometime and was
  used in my neck of the woods, out Barkerville way. (a gold rush town
  from the 1890's that has been made into a tourist trap) Because there
  were so many Chinese that came up to make there fortune, it ended up
  being called Chinese Chews, but she swears that the name is Date
  Chewsticks.
  
  BEGIN RECIPE::::::::
  
  NOTE:  no margarine or shortening!!!!
  
  Beat eggs and sugar, add baking powder, vanilla, and flour. Add the
  dates last and mix thoroughly.  Batter will be thick. Pour into a
  greased 8 x 8 pan and bake at 350 for 25 to 30 minutes. When cooled
  sprinkle icing sugar over the top and rub in until completely coated
  with icing sugar.
  
  Can be doubled and baked in a 9 x 13 pan.  Takes about 10 - 15 minutes
  longer.
  
  I have also used that candied fruit that is available at Xmas in
  place of the dates and it is wonderful. To make it real fancy for a
  "DO", use a paper doily before sprinkling the icing sugar on top.

      Yield: 3 Cups
 
      8 oz Pitted medjool dates
    1/4 ts Red chili powder
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Cumin powder
      3 c  Water
    1/2 ts Tamarind paste
 
  This recipe calls for tamarind paste, a sweet-and-sour flavoring made
  from the beanlike tamarind fruit.  If you can't find tamarind paste,
  add 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 cup vinegar to dates during cooking.
  
  Place dates in a medium saucepan and cover with water. Cook until
  soft and tender, about 25 minutes.  Or cook dates for 15 minutes in a
  pressure cooker.  Set cooked dates aside to cool.
  
  Puree dates in small batches in a food processor or blender, adding a
  little water as needed to make a smooth paste.
  
  Melt tamarind and spices to pureed dates.  Stir well. Add more water
  as needed to make a thick sauce.

      2    Garlic cloves
      1    Sprig of parsley
      1    Celery rib; thickly sliced
      3    Bay leaves
      1 tb Thyme; fresh

           - Cotes de Provence
      1 tb Olive oil; (1) extra virgine
      6 cl Olive oil; (2) extra virgine
      1 ts Peppercorns; whole black
      3    Cloves; whole
      3 tb Butter; unsalted
    500 g  Mushrooms
      1 tb Tomato paste
           Salt
           Pepper
      1    Orange; grated zest and
           - juice
 
  One day before serving the stew: In a large nonreactive bowl, combine
  the meat with the carrots, onions, garlic, parsley, celery, bay
  leaves, thyme, marc, red wine, and the olive oil (1). Tie the
  peppercorns and cloves in a piece of cheesecloth; add to the bowl and
  toss well. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours, stirring once or
  twice. Let the meat and vegetables return to room temperature. With a
  slotted spoon, remove the meat from the marinade. Drain well; pat dry
  on paper towels. Set the vegetables aside. Transfer the liquid and
  the cheesecloth bag to a nonreactive large heatproof casserole. Bring
  to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil for 5 minutes to reduce
  slightly. Remove from the heat. In a large skillet, melt the butter
  in the olive oil (2) over high heat. When the foam subsides, add half
  of the meat. Saute, tossing, until browned all over, about 5 minutes.
  With a slotted spoon, transfer the meat to the liquid in the
  casserole. Repeat with the remaining meat. In the same skillet, saute
  the reserved vegetables until browned, about 7 minutes. Transfer the
  vegetables to the casserole. Add the mushrooms to the skillet. Saute
  until lightly browned, about 5 minutes; set aside. Stir the tomato
  paste into the casserole. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat.
  Reduce the heat to very low and simmer, skimming occasionally, until
  the meat is very tender, 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Stir in salt and pepper to
  taste, the mushrooms, and the orange zest and juice. Discard the
  cheesecloth bag of cloves and peppercorns. (The recipe can be
  prepated 2 to 3 days ahead and refrigerated. Reheat before serving.)
  Serve with potatoes, rice, or pasta, and with the same wine used in
  cooking, a sturdy red wine.

  2 1/2 kg Oxtail; into 10 cm
           - (4 in) pieces

MMMMM----------------------------STEW---------------------------------
    300 g  Salt pork; cubed
    500 g  Carrots; peeled, into
           - 2 cm (1/4 in) slices
           Salt
           Pepper; black

MMMMM------------------------FOR SERVING-----------------------------
           Salt; coarse
    250 g  Rigatoni; or large macaroni
 
  Oxtail is one of the most economical and most flavorful cuts of meat,
  and one that takes well to marinating for days in a hearty mixture of
  red wine, herbs, and vegetables. The longer you marinate the mixture,
  the more flavorful it will be, but be sure it marinates at least 3
  days. Oxtail is also a fatty cut ~- give yourself plenty of time to
  allow the stew to cook and then cool, so all the fat can be skimmed
  off. Serve this with thick noodles in warmed soup bowls, accompanied
  by a tossed salad, and of course, a robust red wine. Stick a clove
  into 4 onion quaters. Place all of the marinade ingredients through
  the peppercorns in a large nonreactive casserole. Add the oxtail
  pieces. Cover and refrigerate for up to 5 days. Remove the pan from
  the refrigerator from time to time to stir and evenly distribute all
  the ingredients. The day before you plan to serve the stew, remove
  the casserole from the refrigerator. Remove the pieces of oxtail from
  the marinade and drain well. In a heavy skillet, brown the salt pork
  over medium-high heat until evenly browned. Add the pieces of oxtail,
  in batches, and brown on allsides. Return the oxtail and salt pork to
  the marinade, adding, if necessary, enough water to cover generously.
  Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Carefully skim any impurities or
  grease that rise to the top. Simmer, keeping the mixture bubbling
  gently, until the meat is falling off the bone, at least 2 to 2 1/2
  hours. Remove from the heat to cool. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
  The next day, use a small spoon to remove and discard all the fat
  that has solidified on top of the stew. Add the fresh carrots, salt,
  and pepper, and cook again until the mixture is heated through,
  checking for seasoning from time to time. To serve, bring a large pot
  of water to a boil. Add salt and the pasta. Cook the pasta just until
  firm. Drain well. Evenly divide the pasta among shallow soup bowls.
  With a two-pronged fork, carefully remove the pieces of oxtail from
  the stew. Drain, and place on a carving board. Remove the meat in big
  chunks, and place them on top of the pasta. Carefully spoon the sauce
  and the vegetables on top of the meat, sprinkle with just a bit of
  coarse salt. Serve immediately.

      Title: DAUSSADES
 Categories: Appetizers, French
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
      4 tb Butter
      3 lb Red onions; medium sized
      1 tb Balsamic vinegar
  1 1/4 c  Red wine; full bodied such
           -as Zinfandel or Petit Sirah
           Salt & pepper to taste
           Sherry wine vinegar
    1/4 c  Ham, baked; minced
 
  "Once upon a time, one rainy summer day in France, hungry, damp,
  lost, and tired in a hill town overlooking the stormy Mediterranean,
  I found a tiny auberge. Just like in the books, the patron welcomed
  me warmly and led me to a tiny table beside the fire. Before I could
  even slip out of my damp shoes he reappeared with a glass of red
  wine, a basket of crisp rolls, and a heavenly dish that he called
  "daussades." Whatever you call it, it is bliss. This recipe is as
  close as I can come to the delicious dish that warmed and restored me
  on that stormy day. The long, slow cooking of the onions produces a
  thick, velvety sauce, sweet and a little tart. (The minced ham
  doesn't hurt either.)
  
  Halve the onions lengthwise and slice thinly. In a 4-quart enameled or
  stainless steel saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Add onions,
  swirl them around, cover, and sweat them for 45 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.
  
  Uncover and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring
  frequently, until the onions are glazed and golden, about 15 minutes.
  Add the balsamic vinegar and boil down for 2-3 minutes to glaze
  further.
  
  Reduce heat to low, add the wine, and cook, stirring often, until the
  onions are soft and a beautiful deep brown, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
  
  Season with salt, a grinding or two of black pepper, and a tablespoon
  or so of sherry wine vinegar. Stir in the ham. Serve hot, at room
  temperature, or warm.
  
  AFTERTHOUGHTS: Daussades is wonderful with crusty bread, on toast and
  served with drinks, with grilled chicken, or liver, or steak, or, or,
  or... You may also like to try it with sweet Spanish onions.
  
  This will keep, refrigerated, for 2 or 3 days, so don't wait for a
  rainy day--make it sometime when you have a few hours, then get it
  out and warm it up when you need it. It will be a star in your
  culinary crown; that's a promise.

  Recipe by: chile-heads list - David Wilkinson Here's my favourite
  salsa recipe. Quick to make, and delicious. As with most recipes of
  this type, the quantities are variable according to personal taste,
  but this is what I like...
  
  Drain a little of the juice out of the tomatoes (otherwise it gets a
  little too runny), and then mix all of the ingredients together. The
  number of chiles depends very much on personal taste, and on the type
  available (here in the UK we get a much more limited range on sale),
  but I'm sure you can all figure out just how hot you want to make it.
  
  If possible, leave it to stand for at least half an hour before
  eating, or even overnight, but I can rarely wait that long before
  getting the munchies.
  
  How to eat: well, anyway you like. My favourite is to make a big bowl
  of salsa, take a big bag of tortilla chips, and then to while away
  the evening on the sofa dunking one into the other.

 Categories: Pickles, Vegetables
      Yield: 36 Servings
 
MMMMM----------------------ORIGINAL RECIPE---------------------------
      4 lb Pickling cucumbers
      8 ea Dill heads
      6 ea Cloves of garlic (or more)
      8 c  Water
      2 c  White vinegar
    1/2 c  Pickling salt
    1/2 ts Crushed Red Pepper
      4 ts Whole mustard seed

MMMMM------------------OPTIONS (PERSONAL TASTES-----------------------
      1 ts Alum (option)
      3 ts Crushed Red Pepper (option)
      2 ts Whole mustard seed (change)
 
                            ORIGINAL RECIPE
  
  Wash and dry the cucumbers;  prick a few holes in each with a fork, or
  quarter them lengthwise.  Peel and break the garlic cloves. It is
  easiest to cut the cloves with a sharp knife into thin slices or
  small chunks.
  
  Place half of the dill heads in the bottom of a clean 1-gallon jar.
  Add the garlic, crushed red pepper, and mustard seed. Pack loosely
  with cucumbers and top with the remaining dill. Refrigerate while
  preparing brine.
  
  Combine water, vinegar, and salt in a saucepan.  Heat to boiling,
  then cool to room temperature.  Pour the cooled brine over the
  cucumbers, making sure they are covered. Screw a lid on the jar and
  store in the fridge for about 4 - 6 weeks before serving. If you've
  quartered the cucumbers instead of leaving them whole, they will be
  ready somewhat sooner (two or three weeks instead).
  
  Ingredients can also be divided between four 1-quart widemouth jars.
  It is it more convenient to make a gallon jar batch (takes less of a
  footprint in the refrigerator) and then divide up the pickles later
  into separate jars when they're ready to eat.  (That frees up the jar
  for the next batch, too)
                OPTIONS, PERSONAL TASTES AND MODIFICATIONS
  
  A great garlic pickle results from deletion of the dill heads. The
  dill heads are not necessary for an excellent pickle.
  
  The addition of a small amount of alum (1 tsp.) makes a marked
  improvement in the flavor of the pickles.  I recommend the addition
  highly.
  
  For hot dill pickles, increase the pepper flakes to 2 or 2 1/2 tsp.
  Cut the cucumbers in 1 inch slices instead of length wise for
  identification purposes.
  
  This pickle has a pronounced mustard flavor when pickling is complete.
  Reduce the mustard seed to 2 tsp if desired . This produces a pickle
  closer to those found in the stores.
  
  The following can be added. 6 to 8 whole pepper corns, 3 to 4 mace
  heads and 1/2 tsp. whole corriander. Other spices can be used. Do not
  use pickling spice mixes bought in stores. These are meant for sweet
  pickles.

      Title: DAVE'S HORSERADISH
 Categories: Condiments, Information
      Yield: 1 How-to
 
           Horseradish roots
           Vinegar
           Kosher salt
 
  Every Spring, for the Easter/Passover season, I make gallons of
  prepared horseradish for my family and friends. My horseradish has a
  reputation for being the strongest kickass root available. Anyone,
  though, can make root that can stand up to mine...if you use my
  instructions. <g>
  
  Selecting the root:  Bring a small knife with you to the supermarket.
  Pick up every root you're considering buying and give it a squeeze.
  If it's limp, feels fleshy or flaccid, or wrinkled, forget it. Select
  only fresh roots that feel rather heavy for their size and are as
  hard as wood. Use the knife to pare off a thin bit of the root and
  pop it in your mouth. Bite down on it. If it makes your lip and
  tongue go numb and tingly, it's good. Don't buy it if it's weak, or
  if it leaves a bitter quinine aftertaste (the bitterness will be
  magnified by grinding.)
  
  Preparation:  Set up a table in front of a window. Open up the window
  and set up a fan to blow air OUT the window. Horseradish fumes are
  crippling and you will NOT be able to do this without pulling the
  fumes out the window.  By exhausting air out rather than blowing in,
  you can even do this on a chilly night when you might otherwise not
  want a window open.
  
  On the window table put your food processor.  If you can run your
  processor with both the shredding blade in the top and the puree
  knives in the bottom, great. Set it up that way. If not, you'll have
  two steps (grating and pureeing) instead of one.  Next to the
  processor, still in front of the window, put a large bowl. That's
  where the ground root will go. Close at hand (maybe on the kitchen
  table) put the jars where the root will be packed, a large bottle of
  vinegar, and your salt.
  
  Step 1:  Wash and peel.  Put all the roots into the sink and start
  running a thin stream of cold water. Get them all wet and let them
  sit a few minutes to soften the dirt on them. With a stiff bristle
  brush, give them a good scrubbing under the stream of water. When
  they're clean, use a veggie peeler to pare off the brown skin and
  green tops (if they have green tops. You can cut the top inch off the
  root, leaving the greens alone, if you like, and plant them in your
  backyard if you want to grow your own.) Do the peeling under the
  running water, also. Keeping the water drizzling over the root while
  you peel carries off some of the volatile chemical, saving your life
  while you work in the sink. <g>
  
  Step 2:  Grate and Grind.  Bring the peeled roots over to the window
  table and turn the fan and your food processor on. Feed them down the
  chute to the grating wheel. The top wheel will grate the root, and
  the bottom knives will do the fine chopping (if you can't run both
  knives in your machine at once, you will have to grate each bowl full
  of root, then put the chopping knife in to finish separately.) As the
  root gets finer and finer, it will begin sticking to the sides and
  bottom of the bowl. Slowly, and with the processor still running,
  pour in vinegar to get a thick but not sticky consistency.  Continue
  to whirl in the bottom knives for several minutes, until the root
  bits are very very fine. Stop the processor and dump the processor
  bowl into the large bowl. Repeat these steps until all the roots are
  grated, ground, and in the large bowl. Remember to keep the fan on
  all this time! When all the roots have been processed, rinse the
  processor knives and bowl with cold running water. Wash them as
  necessary. Put the processor away or aside. You'll need the space on
  the table in front of the fan to pack the jars.
  
  Step 3:  Seasoning.  You've still got that fan running, right? Leave
  the bowl in front of the fan. The grated root in the bowl should not
  be too dry. Stir in enough vinegar to give a smooth consistency.
  Taste a little bit of the puree (be careful!  This is likely to be
  the strongest horseradish you've ever tasted.) If you think it needs
  salt, add some Kosher salt or canning salt. I usually add about half
  a teaspoon per quart.
  
  Step 4:  Packing.  Use a ladle and a canning funnel to fill pint jars
  with the prepared horseradish.  Fill the jars up, cap them off, and
  put them in the fridge. Do not process the jars. Keep them
  refrigerated. You may turn off the fan after all the jars are full
  and after all implements have been rinsed. The horseradish will
  maintain full potency for a couple of weeks (I make mine no more than
  a week or so before Easter) but will still be pretty damn strong for
  a month or two. Use it before it turns brown.
  
  Cleaning up:  Most of your tools (the bowls, ladle, etc) will require
  little more than a good rinse with cold water first (to neutralize and
  dilute any horseradish fumes) then hot water, since you aren't
  cutting any greasy fat.
  
  That's it;  that's how to make horseradish.

      Title: DAVE'S RIBS
 Categories: Main
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      2    7 pound racks of pork ribs
    1/2 c  Ground black pepper
    1/2 c  Paprika
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 tb Kosher or sea salt
      4 ts Dry mustard
      2 ts Cayenne pepper
 
  The night before...
  
  The ribs should be trimmed of all hard fat and the membrane removed
  from the underside. To remove it, poke a hole and run your finger
  under the membrane, then rip it away.
  
  Rub both sides of the ribs with a thick coat of the following mixture:
  
  *  1/2 cup ground black pepper * 1/2 cup paprika * 1/2 cup sugar (run
  this through the coffee grinder to make TURBINADO sugar) * 2
  tablespoons Kosher or sea salt (run this through the coffee grinder
  with the sugar) * 4 teaspoons dry mustard * 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper
  
  Place the ribs in a plastic bag and refrigerate overnight.
  
  (Thanks to Smoke & Spice by Cheryl and Bill Jamison, published by The
  Harvard Common Press, Boston, Massachusetts, $14.95, for the
  inspiration for this rub. If you are only planning to buy ONE
  barbecue book, this is it!) More barbecue books at the end of this
  page.
  
  The next day. Remove the ribs from the refrigerator and let them come
  to room temperature.
  
  Start a fire in your Webber Grill or smoker with charcoal. As the
  coals turn gray add hard wood chunks or water soaked wood chips.
  Bring the smoker temperature to between 210 and 225 degrees by
  adjusting the vents. Hold this temperature throughout the smoking (90
  minutes) by adding more wood or charcoal.
  
  Place the ribs on the rack and smoke cook them, in heavy smoke, for at
  least two hours. Add wood or chips every 30 minutes or so. The ribs
  should have a dark "crust" formed by the smoke clinging to the rub.
  Try not to knock it off when handling them, that is where the flavor
  is!
  
  Preheat the oven to 225 degrees. Place the ribs on racks over cookie
  sheets and place in oven. Cook for three hours, or until the rib
  bones are easily removed when you twist them. These are called "dry
  ribs". No extra spices or MOP was used in the cooking process.
  
  To make juicier ribs, brush them with barbecue sauce (the recipe
  follows) and cover with aluminum foil to bake for the last hour.
  
  Ribs can be made a day or two ahead and reheated in a warm oven (the
  way restaurants do!)
  
  Serve with barbecue beans, coleslaw, potato salad, and plenty of cold
  beer. Enjoy!

      Title: DAVE'S SALSA (THANKS TO JULIA)
 Categories: Mexican, Salsa
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
 
       14 oz Tin chopped plum tomatoes
  :          Juice of two limes
  :          Some chiles -- chopped
        2    Cloves garlic -- crushed
        6    Spring Onions (scallions) --
  :          Chopped
        1 ts sugar
  
  Here's my favourite salsa recipe. Quick to make, and delicious. As
  with most recipes of this type, the quantities are variable according
  to personal taste, but this is what I like...
  
  Drain a little of the juice out of the tomatoes (otherwise it gets a
  little too runny), and then mix all of the ingredients together. The
  number of chiles depends very much on personal taste, and on the type
  available (here in the UK we get a much more limited range on sale),
  but I'm sure you can all figure out just how hot you want to make it.
  
  If possible, leave it to stand for at least half an hour before
  eating, or even overnight, but I can rarely wait that long before
  getting the munchies.
  
  How to eat: well, anyway you like. My favourite is to make a big bowl
  of salsa, take a big bag of tortilla chips, and then to while away
  the evening on the sofa dunking one into the other.

      Yield: 1 Servings
 
 
  :          see dir page
  
  I have made my own caeser salad for over 20 years. I learned it from a
  friend and I have made a few changes that have improved it. I order
  caesar salad when I see it on the menu and to be honest, mine is the
  best. Start with a medium head of romaine lettuce. Holding head
  firmly, cut 1/2" off botton and then cut entire head in 1" slices.
  Put in cold water. Let sit while preparing dressing.In a very large
  wooden bowl add the following: 3" strip of anchovie paste; 1 coddled
  egg (a must); the juice of 1/2 lemon; 4 T balsamic vineger; 5 T olive
  oil (I do not use extra virgin because it does not have the taste;
  the less expensive, more pressed olive oil is my choice); 1-2 cloves
  or garlic pressed; 1/2 t seasoned salt; 1 T Lea and Perrin; Tobasco
  to taste, 4-5 drops; 2-3 T parmasean cheese fresh grated (never out
  of a box); your favorite croutons. Start with the garlic and anchovy
  paste. Mix in bowl with all liquids; add remaining ingredients; put
  in croutons to let sit in liquid for a few seconds. Thoroughly dry
  lettuce (use spinner if you have one) and put in bowl. Toss until all
  lettuce is coated. Add fresh groung pepper (I like a lot) and a few
  more croutons. Serve immediately. Offer more pepper. Please note that
  you cannot make this ahead; it will be no good in 1-2 hours. Also, if
  you do not eat all salad throw out remaining. Romane lettuce gets
  very bitter and cannot be left over.

  for 8 hours. After 3 hours on high or 6 hours on low mix the
  cornmeal, if needed with the beef stock and add to pot. This is the
  first time I tried this chili. It was cooked in the crock pot because
  Sears tried to deliver a damaged stove on 02/17/94. Chili was cooked
  on 02/19/94. The Daytona 500 is on Sunday the 20th. We will have ribs
  cooked in the Nesco. Linda made her potato salad and we will have
  this chili. NOTE: The crock pot was to full, use less meat or less
  liquid. NOTE: Chili was no good! We mixed it with dry dog food and
  gave it to the dogs. The meat must be browned before it is put in the
  C/P.

 Categories: Digest, Mar95, Text
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      1 ea Text file
 
  Here's a method for de-gassing dried beans that seems to work. It's
  from the new book Fat Free, Flavor Full by Dr. Gabe Mirkin and Diana
  Rich.
  
  "Put the beans in a large pot and cover them with water. Bring them
  to a boil and take them off the heat. This breaks the capsules
  surrounding the beans and allows stachyose, verbascose and raffinose,
  the gas-causing sugars, to escape into the water.  Stir a couple of
  tablespoons of baking soda into the water and let the beans soak
  overnight. Drain the soaking water off the beans and rinse them
  several times. (If you eat the soaking liquid, you will cause
  unbelievable discomfort for yourself and those around you.)" Then you
  cook 'em and eat 'em. End of story, so to speak. I've used this
  method with pinto beans, but rarely soak them for more than 4 hours
  (because when I'm hungry for beans I want them today, not tomorrow).
  I've found it better than Beano, but of course your mileage may vary.

  beans
  
  My aunt gave me a very helpful hint in regards to reducing the
  odiferous properties of beans.  She did this with pinto beans, but I
  am guessing that it would work with any type. Cut up about three or
  four carrots into good size chunks, and put them in the beans, and
  leave them there the whole time you cook them and stuff. They
  supposedly absorbed the gas. It seemed to really work.  Just DON'T
  eat the carrots; throw them away. If you even have a nibble, it'll be
  dangerous!

  Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  
  Thought you might like a recipe for a lemon pie.  It is dead simple
  and rivals key lime pie for taste but has none of the egg yolks. Got
  this out of my local Rural Electric monthly newletter.
  
  If you chill this mix in a freezer it tastes an awful lot like ice
  cream.

      1 tb Olive oil
      1 sm Onion, finely chopped
      1 c  Mushrooms, thinly sliced
      2 c  Water
 
  Preheat the oven to 350F degrees. Lightly oil an 8 x 8 baking pan.
  
  Put 3 1/2 cups of the water and the lentils in a large saucepan.
  Cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then immediately
  reduce the heat and simmer until the water is absorbed, 50 to 60
  minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, put the tofu, the remaining 1 cup water, the oats, soy
  sauce and pepper in a blender and blend until smooth. Add the
  parsley, basil, thyme, and sage and pulse just to mix. Transfer to a
  large bowl.
  
  Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add
  the celery, onion, and garlic and cook until softened, about 6
  minutes. Add to the tofu mixture.
  
  Add cooked lentils to tofu-vegetable mixure, and stir to mix. Press
  the mixture firmly into the prepared pan, and bake for 15 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, put the almonds, yeast flakes and soy sauce in a food
  processor fitted with the metal blade, and pulse to coarsely chop.
  
  Sprinkle the topping over the top of the lentil loaf and bake for 15
  minutes more. Let the loaf cool for 10 minutes before cutting into
  squares. Serve with the Mushroom Miso Sauce on the side.
  
  Mushroom Miso Sauce:
  
  Put flour in a small dry frying pan over medium heat and toast,
  stirring often, until it has darkened evenly to a light brown.
  Transfer the browned flour into a medium bowl.
  
  In a small bowl, stir the nutritonal yeast, miso and hot water
  together.
  
  In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Sautee
  onion until softened, about 5 mins. Add mushrooms and saute until
  lightly brown, about 5 mins.
  
  Meanwhile, add 2 cups water to the browned flour. Whisk until well
  combined.
  
  Spoon flour mixture into the mushrooms, and simmer, whisking often,
  until the mixture is thickened, 1 to 2 mins. Stir in the nutritional
  yeast and miso mixture. Bring just to a simmer, and remove from the
  heat. Serve hot.

  springform pan, line with parchment paper, and grease again. Pipe
  meringue through a pastry bag using the round tube, forming a spiral
  on the bottom of the springform pan, starting from the center and
  working out toward the sides until the bottom is completely covered.
  Bake at 250 degrees for 2 hours. Allow to cool in the pan. Genoise:
  Grease a 10" x 3" round baking pan, line with baking parchment, and
  grease again. Combine beaten eggs and sugar in the top of the double
  boiler. Heat to lukewarm. Remove from the heat. Pour into a mixing
  bowl and beat on high speed about 10 minutes, or until the batter
  forms a ribbon.  Sift the flour and cocoa into the batter and fold to
  combine. Fold in the butter.  Pour into the prepared pan and bake at
  350 degrees 35 to 40 minutes, or until the cake springs back when
  lightly touched and a toothpick comes out clean. Cool thoroughly.
  Remove from pan. Mousse:  Melt chocolate in the top of a double
  boiler over simmering water. Remove pan from the heat and cool. Beat
  in the egg yolks, one at a time. Beat the egg whites until soft peaks
  form. Lightly fold a quarter of the beaten egg whites into the
  chocolate. Fold in the remaining egg whites, lightly but thoroughly.
  Chill. Ganache: Heat chocolate and cream together in the top of the
  double boiler over simmering water until the chocolate melts.  Blend
  well. Assembly: Spoon half the ganache over the meringue layer in the
  pan and smooth evenly over the surface. Cut the chocolate Genoise
  into two 1/4" slices, reserving the rest of the cake for another use.
  Place one slice over the ganache and meringue layer. Cover with about
  half the mousse. Top with the second layer of cake. Spoon the
  remaining mousse over the cake and chill until set, at least four to
  six hours.
  Just before serving, spoon remaining ganache on the cake. Carefully
  line the sides of the cake with chopped toasted almonds. Decorate the
  top with hazelnut roses by placing the whole hazelnuts evenly around
  the top of the cake, then place almond slices around each hazelnut to
  resemble petals.

  Preheat the oven to 225 degrees. Using a 9-inch cake circle as a
  guide, trace a circle with a pencil on a sheet of parchment paper cut
  to fit a baking sheet. Turn the paper over and, with trace mark down,
  place on a baking sheet. To prepare the cocoa meringue, place 4 egg
  whites, the cream of tartar, and salt in the bowl of an electric
  mixer fitted with a balloon whip. Whisk on high until soft peaks
  form, about 45 to 50 seconds. Gradually add 1 cup sugar while while
  continuing to whisk on high. Whisk until stiff, about 1 1/2 minutes.
  Remove the bowl from the mixer and use a rubber spatula to fold in
  and thoroughly combine the remaining 1/4 c sugar, 2 T cocoa, and the
  cornstarch. Fill a pastry bag (with no tip) with the cocoa meringue.
  Fill the traced parchment circle with meringue: start in the center
  and pipe a 3/4-inch-wide spiral towards the outside of the circle.
  Place the meringue in the preheated oven and bake for 15 minutes.
  Lower the oven temperature to 200 degrees and bake for 2 hours and 45
  minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 45 minutes before
  handling. Raise the oven temperature to 325 degrees. While the
  meringue is baking, prepare the chocolate mousse. Heat 1 inch of
  water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium heat. Place 6
  ounces semi-sweet chocolate in the top half of the double boiler.
  Tightly cover the top with film wrap. Allow the chocolate to melt
  slowly, about 9 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir until
  smooth. Keep at room temperature until needed. Place 1 1/2 c heavy
  cream in the well-chilled bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a
  well-chilled balloon whip. Whisk on high until peaks form, about 1
  minute. Set aside. Whisk 3 egg whites in a large stainless steel
  bowl, until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes. Add 2 T sugar and
  continue to whisk until stiff peaks form, about 2 to 2 1/2 minutes.
  Add a quarter of the whipped cream to the chocolate and whisk quickly,
  vigorously, and thoroughly, then add to the egg whites. Now add the
  remaining whipped cream. Fold all together gently but thoroughly.
  Refrigerate the chocolate mousse until needed. See Part 3

  To prepare the chocolate brownie layer, coat a 9 x 1 1/2" cake pan
  with 1 t butter.  Flour the pan with 1 t flour, shaking out the
  excess. Pour the Simply The Best Brownie batter into the prepared
  cake pan, spreading evenly.  Place the pan in the pre-heated oven and
  bake the brownie until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out
  clean, about 30 minutes. Remove the brownie from the ovrn and allow
  to cool in the pan at room temperature for 5 minutes.  Turn out onto
  a cake circle and refrigerate for 15 to 20 minutes.  Remove the
  brownie from the brownie from the refrigerature ans cut in half
  horizontally.  Koop the brownie at room temperature until needed. To
  prepare the ganache, heat 1 1/2 c heavy cream and 3 T butter in a 2
  1/2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil. Place 22
  oz of semi-sweet chocolate in a stainless steel bowl. Pour the
  boiling cream over the chocolate and allow to stand for 5 minutes.
  Stir until smooth. Keep at room temperature until needed. To prepare
  the mocha mousse, heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of the
  double boiler over medium-high heat. Place 14 oz semi-sweet
  chocolate, 4 oz unsweetened chocolate, the water, instant coffee, and
  2 T cocoa in the top half of the double boiler. Tightly cover the top
  with film wrap. Heat for 6 to 7 minutes, remove the film wrap, and
  stir the mixture until smooth. Keep at room temperature until needed.
  Place 5 egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer with a balloon
  whip. Whisk on high until soft peaks form, about 1 minute. Continue
  to whisk while gradually adding 2 tablespoons sugar. Whisk until
  stiff, about 30 seconds. Whip 3/4 c heavy cream in a well-chilled
  stainless steel bowl until stiff. Fold 1/4 of the egg whites into the
  melted chocolate mixture, then fold in the whipped cream. Now fold in
  the remaining egg whites. Keep the mocha mousse at room temperature.

  on a baking sheet. Set the top half of the chocolate brownie inside
  the pan, top side up. Ladle 1 1/2 c of ganache into the pan over the
  chocolate brownie. Trim the cocoa meringue with a serrated knife so
  that it will fit tightly into the pan. Place the trimmed cocoa
  meringue, top side up, inside the pan on top of the ganache, pressing
  down gently on the cocoa meringue, spreading evenly. Place the
  remaining chocolate brownie half, bottom side up, on top of the mocha
  mousse. Chill the cake in the freezer for 30 minutes or refrigerate
  for 1 hour. See Part 4.

  Remove the cake from the freezer and cut around the edges to release
  from the springform pan.  Pour the remaining ganache over the cake
  and use a cake spatular to spread the ganache evenly over the top and
  sides of the cake.  Refrigerate the cake for 10 to 15 minutes to set
  the ganache. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip with the
  chocolate mousse. Pipe a circle of stars (each touching the other)
  along the outside edge of the top of the cake. Continue to pipe out
  circlaes of stars until the top of the cake is covered. Refrigerate
  the Death by Chocolate for at least 4 hours, and prefreably 12 hours,
  before cutting and serving. Prepare the Mocha Rum Sauce ( the sauce
  may be prepared just prior to serving or several hours in advance).
  To serve, cut the Death by Chocolate into the desired number of
  servings. Heat the blade of a serrated slicer under hot running water
  before slicing into the cake. Repeat this procedure after cutting
  each slice. Before placing the cake slice on the 10" diameter plates,
  flood the base of each plate with 3 or 4 T Mocha Rum Sauce, then
  place a piece of Death By Chocolate in the center of each plate.

 Categories: Cakes
      Yield: 1 Servings
 
      3 pk Ladyfingers
    1/2 c  Dark rum
  1 1/2 lb Butter  (no substitutes)
     27 oz Semisweet chocolate chips
     12    Eggs
  2 1/2 c  Heavy cream
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla
      2 tb Vegetable oil
 
  Paint outside of the ladyfingers with rum, and place flat side down,
  around the sides and on the bottom of a 10 in. springform pan. Melt
  butter in medium pan; remove from heat and add 24 oz. of the
  chocolate bits. Stir until melted; cool slightly.  Beat the egg yokes
  into the mixture one at a time until all are incorporated into the
  chocolate. Beat the egg whites until they form stiff, not dry, peaks.
  Fold the whites into the chocolate mixture, and pour into the lined
  springform pan. Chill for at least 6 hours.
  
  Whip the cream until thickened and add the sugar and vanilla. Continue
  whipping until very stiff.  Turn the cake onto a serving platter,
  removing the pan sides and bottom (the lady fingers will now be on
  top). Spread a layer of whipped cream over the entire cake, then pipe
  the rest of the whipped cream decoratively however you wish around
  the cake - be imaginative! Melt the remaining chocolate chips with
  the oil in a double boiler.  Cool completely.  Dribble the sauce down
  the sides of the cake. Garnish with stemmed candied cherries. Store
  in the refrigerator.
  
  Should make about 16 servings, or 8 - depending....
  
  Note: If the cake is going to be displayed for any length of time,
  you may wish to use stabalized cream, and add 1 teaspoon of dissolved
  gelatin to the cake mixture.
  
  One more note: I don't know to whom the credit goes for this
  "slightly" fattening recipe, and I apologize for that. But I am
  passing it on to those of you who are in good health. If you are not
  in good health, you use this recipe at your own risk - 12 eggs, 2-1/2
  cups of cream, 27 oz. of chocolate, 1-1/2 lb. of butter (no

      2 ts Pure vanilla extract
      2 ts Dark rum
    3/4 ts Salt

    1/8 ts Cream of tartar
 
  Total weight of ingredients: about 10 pounds, 2.1/2oz. Total cost of
  ingredients: it may be less expensive to visit the Trellis!
  
  For organizational & shopping convenience the above is a compilation
  of all the ingredients needed to produce Death By Chocolate The Chefs
  Touch! You will not find the recipe for Death by Chocolate in a
  culinary lexicon. It is a contemporary concoction, an amalgam of
  cocoa meringue, chocolate mousse, chocolate ganache, chocolate
  brownie & mocha mousse, structured in an extraordinary, albeit sound
  manner. A fair warning must be issued that this is a time & money
  consuming recipe. It is best to start work on this cake very early in
  the day if it is to be served that evening. Death by Chocolate may be
  held for two to three days under refrigeration, but it is at its best
  when served within 24 hours of completion. The preparation in one day
  of all the chocolate components of this cake might seem overwhelming.
  To prepare in advance, spread the production out over a period of
  three days.
  
  Day 1: Prepare the chocolate brownie & keep refrigerated until cake
  assembly.
  
  Day 2:  Bake the cocoa meringue & store in a dry place at room
  temperature (between 68 & 78 degrees). Prepare the chocolate rum
  sauce, refrigerate until two hours before service, then bring to room
  temperature.
  
  Day 3: Prepare the chocolate mousse, mocha mousse & ganache. Assemble
  cake. Use the 9" bottom of the springform pan to trace the circle
  onto parchment paper. Be certain that the meringue completely fills
  the traced circle. If the meringue is not large enough, the sides of
  the cake will be uneven. Do not be concerned if the meringue slightly
  overlaps the circle.; any excess may be trimmed off after the
  meringue has been baked. Baked meringues are very brittle; handle
  with care. Use a very sharp serrated knife to trim the meringue;
  otherwise the meringue will break apart.
  
  If the mocha mousse is prepared several hours in advance of the
  assembly of the cake, it should be refrigerated  until 1 to 1.1/2
  hours before assembly, at which time it should be allowed to temper
  at room temperature (if it is too cold it will be too difficult to
  spread evenly over the delicate mocha meringue). If the ganache
  solidifies, place the bowl containing the ganache in a pan of water &
  stir until the texture is correct for pouring. Use several toothpicks
  inserted in the sides of the chocolate brownie as guides to
  accurately halve the brownie horizontally. The preparations may also
  be completed using a hand held mixer, but preparation time may
  increase slightly.

  into two 1/4" slices, reserving the rest of the cake for another use.
  Place one slice over the ganache and meringue layer. Cover with about

      1 qt Whole cream
      2 c  Water
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 c  Sugar; brown
      4    Eggs; large
      3 ts Vanilla; madagascar bourbon
 
  soak tapioca in 2 cups cold water in refrigerator overnight. Drain and
  place in a large sauce pan with cream and 2 cups water. Bring to a
  boil, add sugar and vanilla slowly, stirring the whole time (it will
  get very thick very fast and lump if you don't)   Beat eggs to a
  froth, add to pudding mixture.  Simmer for 5 minutes (until eggs are
  set with the rest of the pudding) Chill overnight, warm each serving
  (microwave works best) and serve. This is a very rich pudding. Most
  people will not want very much, however they will savor each bite! If
  you do not chill the pudding overnight you are missing the chance to
  taste the best vanilla pudding you have ever allowed you pallet to
  enjoy. The vanilla called for in the recipe may be purchased through
  williams sonoma (direct or mail order) or may be replaced with any
  GOOD real vanilla extract such as found in many fine cooking stores.
  I have tried it with "american" vanilla extracts but keep returning
  to the madagascar.

    1/4 c  Marsala Wine
 
  On top of a double boiler or bain-marie, whisk the egg yolks and sugar
  until dissolved.  (I use an electric hand mixer) Add the marsala
  slowly, while whisking constantly. Continue to whisk until the
  mixture is thick and VERY fluffy.  Serve warm in a pretty long
  stemmed glass. This can also be served as a sauce on top of fruit and
  or angel food cake.

           Rosewater

           Biscotti
           Whipping Cream
           Fruit, fresh
 
  Prepare a simple syrup by bringing 2 parts of water and 1 part sugar
  to a boil. Remove from heat and add flavoring. Rosewater (to taste)
  for a Middle Eastern accent or ground ginger (and use the ginger
  biscuits) for a spicier dish or choose almond syrup or maple syrup or
  a good shot of brandy. Place as many biscotti as desired in a shallow
  bowl or on a plate. Spoon a little of the hot syrup over the
  biscotti. You will use approximately 1 Tbsp per cookie.  Let soak for
  5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whip some cream. You'll want about 1 Tbsp
  per cookie. By the time the cream is whipped, the biscotti should be
  softened. Drain off any excess syrup and spoon the cream onto the
  soaked cookies. Serve immediately. (Good, too, the next day when it's
  soggy). Fresh fruit such as strawberries or cherries are a wonderful
  foil against the dessert's sweet richness.

  1 1/2 lb Cream cheese, softened
      1 c  Sugar
  2 1/2 ts Vanilla
      1 tb Apricot brandy
      2 c  Sour cream
 
   * or use graham cracker crumbs
    Melt white chocolate over low heat in a double boiler. Set aside to
  cool slightly. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Distribute pound cake
  crumbs evenly over the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Press
  crumbs down lightly. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream together cream
  cheese, sugar, vanilla, and apricot brandy with an electric mixer for
  at least five minutes or until very smooth. Add melted white
  chocolate and blend another five minutes. Add sour cream and mix to
  combine. Pour into crumb lined pan and bake at 350 degrees for 30
  minutes. Chill overnight before serving.
  
   This cheesecake freezes very well, and makes about 12-14 slices. It
  goes well with commercial fruit sauces or fresh fruit but it is so
  delicious that it really doesn't need anything else! It does look
  nice when it is garnished with fresh raspberries and mint sprigs
  though. This one has been described as "to die for"!!!

  Line 2 greased jelly-roll pans, 15x10x1-inch each, with wax paper and
  butter and flour the paper, shaking off excess. In a large bowl with
  an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks. Add slowly 1-1/2 cups sugar,
  beating, and beat the mixture until it is thick and pale and forms a
  ribbon. Add the chocolate and combine the batter well.
  
  In another large bowl with clean beaters, beat the egg whites until
  they hold soft peaks.  Add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar slowly, and
  beat until whites hold stiff peaks. Stir a fourth of the whites into
  the yolk mixture, fold in remaining whites gently but thoroughly, and
  pour the batter into the pans, spreading it evenly. Bake the cake
  layers in the middle of a preheated 375f oven for 18-20 minutes or
  until pick test. Let cake layers cool in the pans, covered with
  kitchen towels on large racks. Invert the cake layers onto the racks
  and remove the wax paper carefully.
  
  Buttercream:      In a small heavy saucepan, dissolve sugar in 1/3 cup
  water over moderate heat, stirring. Bring mixture to a boil, and boil
  it until it registers240f on a candy thermometer.
  
  In a large bowl with an electric mixer, beat eggs until they are
  frothy. Add sugar syrup in a thin stream, beating, and beat the
  mixture until it is cool.  Beat in the butter, one Tbsp at a time.

  remove from heat.  Add chocolate and stir until it is smooth. Transfer
  mixture to a bowl and chill, covered, stirring occasionally, until it
  is cool and thickened.  Do not let it solidify. Beat the mixture
  until it just forms soft peaks, but do not overbeat.
  
  Assembly:        Force preserves through a fine sieve into a bowl.
  Transfer the cake layers to a work surface. Trim edges and halve each
  layer lengthwise. On a serving plate, arrange one layer, spread with
  a third of the preserves, and spread a third of the ganache over the
  preserves. Top with another layer and proceed with the preserves,
  ganache and cake in the same manner, ending with a cake layer on top.
  Spread the sides and top of the cake with a thin layer of buttercream
  an chill for 30 minutes. Spread on additional buttercream, leaving
  about 1/3 cup to make rosettes. With a pastry comb or tines of a
  fork, score the buttercream lengthwise. Draw the back of a knife
  crosswise across the scored buttercream at intervals. Transfer the
  remaining buttercream to a small pastry bag fitted with a decorative
  tip. Pipe rosettes on top of the torte along the long sides and
  intersperse the rosettes with chocolate coffee beans. Chill.
  
  Remove from refrigerator about 30 minutes before serving.

      Title: DEEP FRIED SHRIMP BALLS
 Categories: Seafood, Oriental, Wok
      Yield: 5 Servings
 
      1 lb Shrimp, cleaned & deveined
      2    Bacon strips
      4    Water chestnuts
           -OR
    1/2 md Onion
           Salt
           Pepper
      1    Egg, beaten
      2 tb Corn starch
           Oil for deep frying
 
  1. Mince shrimp, bacon, onion or water chestnuts together until fine.
  Place mixture in bowl. Remove crusts from bread. Dice bread into very
  fine cubes. Place cubes in shrimp mixture. Add salt, pepper, egg and
  2 tablespoons corn starch to mixture. Combine thoroughly.
  
  2. Fill a wok halfway up with oil. Heat oil on highest heat setting.
  When you think oil is sufficiently heated, test the temperature of it
  with a small piece of bread crust. If it frys to a golden brown
  colour, then oil is ready for deep frying. If bread crust fails to
  brown readily, then oil is not ready yet. If bread crust frys to a
  dark brown, then oil is too hot. Shut heat off of wok, allow oil to
  cool 5 minutes before turning heat on again. Retest oil with bread
  crust to see if it is of proper temperature.
  
  3. When oil is ready for deep frying, take 2 teaspoons, dip into
  shrimp mixture and form a 1" diameter ball. Drop ball into hot oil,
  Place about 8 balls into the hot oil. Allow each ball to deep fry 3
  minutes. Turn balls so that each will fry to a golden brown colour.
  Remove balls to paper toweling to drain excess oil from them. Repeat
  procedure for deep frying rest of shrimp mixture until all of the
  mixture is used up. Place shrimp balls on a serving platter. Garnish
  with parsley or other raw vegetable.

      Title: DEEP FRIED ZUCCHINI
 Categories: Side dish, Italian, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 Servings
 
    250 g  Zucchini (small ones)
    150 ml Soy milk
     50 g  Flour
           Salt & pepper, to taste
           Oil for deep frying
 
  Note. The zucchini should be reasonably small no longer than 6" (15
  cm).
  
  Trim the ends from the zucchini and cut them in half across (to give
  two pieces around 3" long). Then cut each half into lengthwise slices
  around 1/4" (6mm).
  
  Season the flour generously with salt and pepper, and start heating
  the oil. Dip the zucchini pieces into the milk, then into the
  seasoned flour, shaking off any excess flour. As soon as you have
  enough to make a batch, deep fry them in hot oil intol golden. Drain,
  and serve as soon as possible. These zucchini do _not_ keep at all.

      Title: DEEP RICH BEEF BRISKET
 Categories: Outdoor, Beef
      Yield: 6 Servings
 
           Beef brisket (3-5 lb)
    1/2 c  Flour
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Paprika
    1/4 ts Pepper
      2 tb Peanut or canola oil
      1 c  Water
      1 ts Instant beef bouillon
      2 lg Onions, thinly sliced
      2 lg Tomatoes, diced with seeds
           .removed (see note)
      3    Cloves garlic, crushed
    1/4 c  Catsup
      2 ts Cornstarch
      3 tb Water
 
  Arrange charcoal for indirect cooking (not directly under meat). Place
  flour, salt, pepper and paprika in a large zip-lock baggie. Place
  meat in bag and shake to coat.  Heat oil in a large skillet and sear
  meat until it is browned. Set brisket aside; add water and bring to a
  boil. Add bouillon and dissolve. Stir in remaining ingredients
  (except cornstarch and 3 tbsp water); mix well and remove from heat.
  Place brisket on center of a large piece of tin foil. (Set skillet
  aside, you will be using it later on.) Pour bouillon mixture over
  both sides of brisket. Wrap brisket tightly with two more sheets of
  tin foil turning the wrap 90 degrees after each wrapping. This will
  help keep the juices from seeping out.
  
  When coals are white hot throw the brisket on. Cover and cook for
  about 2 hours; turning it over after one hour. Add more charcoal as
  necessary. Remove from grill and carefully open package without
  spilling juices. Pour juices into skillet; recover brisket to keep
  warm. Combine cornstarch and water; mix well. Pour into skillet and
  heat to boiling to make gravy; stirring constantly. Serve brisket
  when gravy has thickened.
  
  NOTE: To remove seeds cut tomato in half. Hold it over the sink and
  gently squeeze with your fingers. The pulp and seeds will begin to
  loosen and you'll quickly get the hang of it. Rotate tomato half
  around with your fingers to completely remove pulp and seeds. Repeat
  with remaining half and then dice.
