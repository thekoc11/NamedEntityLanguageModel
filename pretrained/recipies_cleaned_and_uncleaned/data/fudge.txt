candy

2 cup sugar
1 can (5-ounce) evaporated milk
1/3 cup milk
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 broken nuts (optional)

Line an 8x4x2-inch loaf pan with foil, extending foil over edges of
pan. Butter foil; set aside.

Butter the sides of a heavy 2-quart saucepan.  In saucepan combine
sugar, evaporated milk, milk, and salt.  Cook and stir over
medium-high heat to boiling.  Carefully clip a candy thermometer to
the side of the saucepan. Cook and stir over medium-low-heat to 238
degrees, soft-ball stage (this should take 25 to 35 minutes).

Immediately remove saucepan from heat.  Add butter and vanilla, but
do not stir.  Cool mixture, without stirring, to 110 degrees,
lukewarm (about 55 minutes).  Remove candy thermometer from saucepan.
Beat vigorously with a wooden spoon till fudge becomes very thick and
just starts to lose its gloss (about 10 minutes total). Do not
overbeat.

Immediately spread fudge into the prepared pan.  Score into 1-inch
squares while warm.  Top each square with a piece of nut, if desired.
When candy is firm, use the foil to lift the fudge out of the pan.
Cut into squares. Store, tightly covered, in the refrigerator. Makes
about 1 pound (32 servings).

Caramel Fudge

deserts, candy

6 cup sugar, divided
2 cup light cream
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup butter or margarine
8 1/2 cup (2 pounds.) pecans, broken

The flavor of this golden brown fudge comes from the caramelized
sugar. Combine 4 cups sugar and cream in a heavy 4-quart saucepan.
Set aside. Melt 2 cups sugar in a heavy 10-inch skillet over medium
heat. Stir sugar constantly until it begins to melt. Heat sugar-cream
mixture over medium heat. Continue melting sugar in skillet, stirring
and watching closely so it does not scorch. As soon as it is
completely melted, por liquid sugar in a thin stream into boiling
sugar-cream mixture, stirring constantly. Do not let sugar remain
over heat after completely melted; this will produced a scorched
taste. Cook com- bined mixtures to 246 degrees F. Remove from heat
and add baking soda and butter. Stir in and let candy stand for 30
minutes. Add nuts. Stir to mix; pour into buttered 9-inch square
pans. Cool slightly and cut into squares. Makes about 78 pieces.

Nina - get the Hershey Chocolate powder and look on the can for the fudge
candy recipe.  Make it as directed but:

Add 1/4 cup flour to the sugar and mix in well.
Replace all or part of the milk with wine or add a bit of ascorbic acid.
Only cook it to just past the first rolling boil - long enough to cook
the
flour.

This makes a marvelous fudge topping for ice cream and an absolutely
scrumptious filling for a chocolate cake.

Drizzle Bars Made With Failed Fudge

cookies

      ----CRUST----
1/2 cup butter
1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1 cup all-purpose flour
      ----FILLING----
3 1/2 ounce shredded sweetened coconut*
1  recipe failed fudge (too hard, too; soft, etc)
1 cup candy chips*
1 cup walnuts; chopped
14 ounce sweetened condensed milk

* can double these amounts. For chips, choose a flavor complementary
to fudge flavor. For instance, with chocolate fudge, use butterscotch
or peanut butter chips. Use semisweet chocolate with almost anything
else.

Preheat oven to 375'F. Melt butter and blend with sugar and flour
until cohesive. Then press into ungreased pan (8x8 or 9x9). Bake for
20 to 30 minutes. While crust is still hot, spread coconut over it.
Top with chips. Pour too-think fudge haphazardly over chips; dice
too-hard or grainy or chewy fudge and scatter over chips. Scatter
walnuts over that. Drizzle sweetened condensed milk over everything.
Bake for 20 minutes, then use a spatula to press down and compact
bars. Finish baking for 15 to 20 minutes. Cool on a rack and cut.

Yield: 2 1/2 dozen 2x2-inch bars.

Dutch Oven Hot Fudge Pudding

deserts, dutch oven

1  cake mix
2 cup flour
4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)
1 cup granulated sugar
6 tablespoon cocoa
1/3 cup dry milk powder
4 tablespoon margarine or
1  vegetable shortning
2 cup chopped nuts (optional)
1  fudge topping
1 1/3 cup brown sugar
2/3 cup cocoa
1  at the camp site
3 1/2 cup hot water
1  charcoal or alder coals

Make the cake mix and fudge topping at home and pack into ziplock
bags for the camping trip. Mix together the cake mix ingredients
except the nuts. Use a pastry cutter to cut the margarine into the
dry ingreadients until the consistency is that of a meal.. Add the
nuts to the mixture after cutting in the margarine to make the
process easier. Place the mixture in a zip lock bag squeezing out as
much air as possible. Mix the fudge topping together and put into a
zip lock bag removing as much air as possible. At the camp site,start
the charcoal allowing about 12 coals for the bottom and 20 for the
top. Mix the cake mix with 1 cup of cold water and mix until the dry
mix is moistened. Put the cake batter on the bottom of the dutch
oven, spreading it level over the bottom. Shake the fudge topping
materials over the top of the batter, and carefully pour the hot
water over thetopping to wet it all. Put the lid on the dutch oven
and bake for 45 minutes. The cake rises ! ! to the top and the fudge
sauce to the bottom as it bakes. Watch the bottom heat to avoid
burning the bottom. Cool to taste and eat.

Ed's Peanut Butter Fudge

spreads

1 pound peanut butter, smooth, natur
1 pound sugar, powdered
1/2 pound butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
12 ounce chocolate, semi-sweet

Melt the chocolate in a bowl over hot water or the top of a double boiler.
Make sure you don't get even a drop of water in the chocolate. Stir
frequently with a spatula while doing the following steps and remove it
from the hot water just as soon as it's melted.

Melt the butter.  Mix together the powdered sugar, the melted butter and
the vanilla. Don't bother sifting the powdered sugar. Just stir everything
together with a wooden spoon until it's smooth and creamy. Stir in the
peanut butter. This will break most flimsy wooden spoons if you're not
careful. Mushing everything together with your hands works well and is lots
of fun.

Press the fudge into a buttered 8 or 9 square pan.  You don't need much
butter, just wipe the butter papers over the inside of the pan. You can
also line the pan with foil and butter that; this works especially well if
you're making several batches in a row to give to people as holiday
presents. Press the fudge in firmly; you don't want any air bubbles in it.
You will get your hands messy here.

Pour the chocolate over the fudge and spread it in an even layer.  The
easiest way to do this is to shake the pan gently until the chocolate is
even.  Let the chocolate cool to room temperature. DO NOT PUT IT IN THE
REFRIGERATOR.

Using a sharp knife cut the fudge into 1 squares.  If you defied my
instructions and put it in the refrigerator, the chocolate layer will
shatter when you try to cut it. Unless you are going to serve it
immediately, store it in the refrigerator. Let it come to room temperature
before serving.

Again, don't scrimp on the peanut butter!  Skippy simply will not do.

NOTES:

*  An extremely rich candy -- I got this recipe from a friend, Ed
Firestone, who is arguably the best cook in Palo Alto. The results resemble
Reese's Peanut Butter Cups that have attained Nirvana. Don't scrimp on the
peanut butter; get the best you can find or make it yourself. If there's
anything besides peanuts and salt in it, find another brand.

*  Unless you use the foil method, you will inevitably destroy at least one
piece getting it out of the pan.  The best method is to line the pan with
foil, let the fudge cool, lift it out, peel off the foil, put it back in
the pan and cut it. This keeps it from sticking to the pan. If you try to
cut it out of the pan, it tends to fall apart.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 15 minutes cooling.
: Precision:  no need to measure.

Failed-Fudge Brownies

cookies

2 cup failed fudge
1  egg
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup milk

Good use of failed fudge: fudge that is too hard, too soft, too
runny, too sugary, too chewy, etc.

Proportions are as follows: for every 2 cups (roughly 1 pound yield)
of any failed fudge that is not runny, you'll need 1 egg, 1/2 cup
all-purpose flour, and 1/2 cup milk. If fudge is soupy, halve the
milk (to 1/4 cup). If fudge is as thin as bouillon, eliminate the
milk.

Mix egg, milk, and flour together until mixture is smooth, then stir
into fudge mixture. Bake in buttered 8x8-inch pan in preheated 325'F
oven for 40 to 45 minutes. A cake tester inserted around the edge
should come out clean; center will obviously still be soft. Place on
rack to cool.

3 ounce unsweetened chocolate
3 tablespoon butter or margarine
1 teaspoon vanilla

heat, stirring constantly, over moderate heat until boiling and
thickened. Reduce the heat to low, add the chocolate and cook and
stir until the chocolate melts. Beat in the butter and vanilla. Cool
slightly, beating now and then. Serve warm. And here's something else
you might try. Simply begin your favorite fudge recipe, but cook the
syrup only to about 220F or 225F. Take it off the heat, cool maybe 10
minutes, then drop in the butter, add the vanilla and heat until
satiny. You couldn't get a more authentic hot fudge sauce than this!

Irish Creme Fudge (Microwave)

candy, christmas

1 small potato (about 5 ounces)
3 tablespoon Irish creme liqueur
2  squares (2 ounce) unsweetened choco; e
3 tablespoon margarine/butter
1 pound powdered sugar, unsifted (about 3-1; /4 cups)
36  walnut pieces

Fudge gets texture from potato: potatoes cooked in the microwave oven
give this fudge its unbelievably creamy, fudgey texture. The mellow
flavor comes from Irish Crem liqueur, used in both the fudge and the
icing. Use a pastry bag to pipe the icing or a spoon to drizzle it
onto the fudge. The added bonux is that this fudge is low in fat.

Designer Icing (recipe follows)

Line an 8x8x2-inch pan with foil. extending foil over the edges of
the pan. Butter foil; set the pan aside. Prick potato 2 or 3 times
witha fork. Cook on 100% power (High) for 4-5 minute sor until
tender, turning over once. Cool and peel.  Mash potato (you should
have 1/3 cup). Add liqueur, stir until smooth.  Set aside.

In a 2-quart microwave-save casserole combine chocolate and margarine;
cook, uncovered, on High for 1-2 minutes or until almost melted,
stirring once. Stir until smooth.

Stir potato mixture into chocolate mixture.  Slowly stir in powdered
sugar. Stir or knead until smooth. Press into the foil-lined pan.
Score into thirty-six 1-1/4-inch squares. Press a walnut piece into
each square. Cover and chill until firm.  Holding foil at edges,
remove the fudge from the pan; cut into squares. Drizzle Designer
icing over fudge.

~=>Designer Icing In a small microwave-save bowl, cook 1 Tbsp
margarine/butter on High for 45 seconds or until melted. Beat in 1/3
cup sifted powdered sugar and enough Irish Creme liqueur (1-2 Tbsp)
to ake an icing of piping or drizzling consistency.

Kohl's Marshmallow Fudge

deserts, fudge

4 cup sugar
1 can milk (14 1/2 ounce)
1 large package (or 2 small) chocolate chip; s
1 pint marshmallow fluff
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup chopped pecans.

(Variation on other Recipes - This is BEST!)
Mix together sugar, milk and butter. Stir constantly
and boil until the soft ball stage. Test by dropping a
drop or two of the boiling mixture into a small
container of ice cold water. If you can roll it up
into a ball without it melting, then it's soft ball
stage. Remove from heat. Add chocolate chips and stir
until melted. Add the marshmallow fluff and vanilla.
Stir until melted and blended. Add nuts. Pour into a
buttered platter or shallow glass pyrex oblong
casserole dish. Cool, then refrigerate until firm. Cut
into 1-2" squares or whatever size you want.

NOTE: It may take as long as 45 minutes of stirring
and boiling before the soft ball stage is reached. It
depends on the kind of pot (stainless steel or ?) and
range (gas or electric) as to how long it takes.

Be sure to record the time and the exact cooking pot
you used. Then all future preparations of this recipe
or any of the several marshmallow fudge recipes will
be 100% fail-proof!

Oatmeal Fudge Cookies

cookies, no bake

3 cup rolled oats
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup nuts, chopped (optional)
2 cup sugar, granulated
1/2 cup cocoa powder
1/2 cup evaporated milk
1/4 pound butter

Combine oats, vanilla and nuts in a bowl and set aside.

Combine sugar, cocoa and evaporated milk in a heavy, 2-quart sauce pan.
Bring to a full rolling boil over medium-high heat, STIRRING CONSTANTLY.
Let boil, while stirring, for 2 minutes.

Remove pan from heat and add the butter.  Stir until butter is melted and
incorporated.  Quickly add oat mixture to pan and stir until well mixed.

Drop by the spoonful onto waxed paper.  Let cool for 2 hours to set.

NOTES:

*  No-bake chocolate oatmeal cookies -- This may be my all-time favorite
cookie recipe.  I don't remember where I got this particular version of the
recipe but I remember my great-aunt making these cookies for us as kids.

*  My great-aunt never put nuts in these cookies.  I like nuts but I find
that they get lost in the recipe. If you want the oats to be less
prominent, use quick-cooking oats. They will fall apart somewhat in the
final mixing.

*  A heavy sauce pan makes burning the fudge less likely but stir, stir,
stir, anyway.

*  The cooking time at boil is important.  Cooked too little the cookies
will not set; too much and they start to harden before you get them out of
the pan.

*  These cookies are better the next day, if there are any left.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation and cooking, 2 hours cooling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients, watch the cooking time.

Combine sugar, milk, baking chocolate, corn syrup and salt in a
heavy 2-quart saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly,
unti mixture boils.  Cook, stirring occasionally, to 234 degrees F
(or until small amount dropped into cold water forms a soft ball).

I checked a 1930 edition of the "Hershey Recipe Book" for fudge

It contains these recipes:  Angel Fudge; Country Club Two Story Fudge;
Chocolate College Fudge; Chocolate Gelatine Fudge; Condensed Milk
Chocolate Syrup Fudge; Whipped Cream Fudge; Molasses Fudge; Cocoa

(different from the one posted above); Sour Cream Fudge.  The fudge

1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 cup chopped fresh dates
2 cup finely chopped nuts

In a large, heavy pot, mix sugar, milk, cream, corn syrup, and
persimmon pulp. Cook over low heat, stirring frequently, for 45
minutes to 1 hour, or until mixture reaches the soft-ball stage

When mixture thickens and butter is absorbed, add dates.

Spread fudge in the prepared pan. When completely cool, cut into small
squares. (If desired, squares may be rolled into balls and then

NOTE: To prepare persimmons, scoop soft persimmon pulp out of skins,
discarding seeds and leaves. Puree in a food processor or blender.

How to chop dates: Chop with a chef's knife (with a blade 6 to 8
inches long) dusted with powdered sugar to keep dates from sticking.
Or cut dates with scissors.

and boil for 6 min. Put chocolate bits, German chocolate, marshmallow
cream, and nutmeats in a bowl.  Pour the boiling syrup over the
