Baked Sandwiches

sandwich, low cal

1 1/4 cup water at 110 to 115 f
2 1/4 teaspoon quick-rise yeast (1 pkg)
2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1  egg
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 cup graham flour
1  filling
1 1/2 lb lean ground beef
1/2 cup chopped onions
1 cup tomato sauce
1/4 cup catsup
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon leaf oregano
1 pinch pepper

May be frozen.  Defrost in the fridge, on the way to a picnic or in
the microwave if you want them in a hurry.

Combine water and yeast in mixer bowl and let stand 5 minutes.  Add
all purpose flour and mix at medium speed for another 4 minutes.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead a few
times, form into a ball and place in a well-greased mixing bowl.
Turn the ball over to grease the top, cover with a cloth and let
stand at room temperature to rise until doubled in volume.

While the dough is rising, cook the meat and onions over medium heat,
stirring frequently, until the onions are soft and the meat is
browned. Drain.  Discard fat and juice, return meat and onions to the
pan.  Add tomato sauce, catsup, seasoning and cook over medium heat
until the meat is dry with no noticeable liquid.  Set meat mixture
aside to cool until dough is ready.

After the dough has doubled in volume, transfer it to a lightly
floured working surface.  Knead lightly.  Form into a roll and cut
into 12 equal portions.  Form each portion into a little ball, cover
with a cloth and let rest for 10 minutes.

Roll each ball out to form a circle 5 to 6 inches across.  Put about
1/4 cup of the meat mixture in the center of the circle.  Pull the
dough up around the filling and press together at the top.  Place on
a well greased cookie sheet, cover with a cloth and let stand about
30 to 40 minutes at room temperature or until doubled in volume.
Bake at 350 F for 40 to 45 minutes or until lightly browned and firm.
Serve hot, using 1 sandwich per serving, or refrigerate or freeze to
be used later.

Sirloin Surprise

low cal, beef

4 tablespoon cheese; grated cheddar
2 tablespoon bbq sauce; bull's eye spicy
4  butter lettuce leaves
1  parsley or cilantro sprigs
1 lb ground sirloin
4 teaspoon green onion; minced
1 teaspoon cavander's spice
8  cherry tomatoes

Select the leanest ground sirloin, or as I do, purchase a very lean
top sirloin steak and remove all visible fat and then grind at home.
(or use other type lean steak, where you cannot see any marbles of
fat in the meat). Mix the meat with the bbq sauce and the cavander's
spice. Divide the meat into 4 portions and shape into balls. Make a
depression in the center of each ball, deep enough to hold 1 Tb of
the cheese and 1 tsp of the onion. Smooth the meat over the top of
the cheese, re-forming into an elongated ball shape. A little trick
is to wet your hands to smooth the meat, as you want to be sure the
cheese is well contained in the ball and will not seep out during
cooking. Place the meat on a rack over a roasting pan, in order to
let any fat drain off. Cook the meat in a 375 degree oven for 45
minutes to 1 hour. To serve: Place one cleaned leaf of the lettuce on
each plate, and top it with the meat. garnish with the tomatoes. I
like to stick the tomatoes with a toothpick, and push them into the
meat, and I also sometimes put a few parsley or cilantro sprigs on
the plate. It is easier to stay on a weight loss campaign if the food
looks appetizing.
