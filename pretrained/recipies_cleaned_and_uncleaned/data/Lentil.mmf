      Yield: 6 servings
 
--------------------------ROMULAN LAMB AND LENTILS--------------------------
      1    6 to 7 lb leg of lamb
           Flour
      1    Onion; cut into chunks
           Salt and pepper
      2 tb Cooking oil
      1 c  Onion; chopped
      2 c  Lentils
     10 oz Beef broth
     10 oz Water
      1    Bay leaf
      1 c  Green onions; sliced
    1/2 c  Chopped parsley
    1/3 c  Pan gravy for roast lamb
      1    Roasting bag
 
  About 4 hours before you want to serve, get the leg of lamb ready and put
  it in the oven; Preheat the oven to 350 degrees, dust the inside of the
  baking bag with flour, put in the large onion as a layer of chunks and put
  the leg of lamb in on top of that. Sprinkle the lamb with salt and pepper
  and close the bag. Poke some holes in the top of the bag. If you wish,
  stick a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the roast, right
  through the bag so you can read the dial: 160 to 190 degrees covers the
  range from moderately rare to well done.
  About 40 minutes before serving time, get the lentils going. Heat the oil
  in a saucepan and cook the chopped onion until soft and golden. Add the
  lentils, beef broth, water, bay leaf, salt and pepper. Simmer for about 30
  minutes, or until the lentils are tender. Fish out the bay leaf and add
  the green onions and the parsley. Mix well, and as you are serving, stir
  in 1/3 cup of pan gravy from the roast, with as little fat as possible.

      Title: KOUSHARI (LENTILS, MACARONI AND RICE IN OIL)
 Categories: Vegetarian, Ethnic
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 c  Ads iswid (brown lentils)
           Water
           Salt
      1 c  Small macaroni noodles
      1 c  Short grain rice
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 c  Tomato puree

---------------------------------TA'LEYA II---------------------------------
      2 lg Onions
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      1    Garlic clove (or more)
           -- finely chopped
 
  This is classed as an 'oil' dish by Coptic Egyptians and is prepared during
  periods of fasting when animal products cannot be taken.  You may cook the
  lentils, macaroni and rice simultaneously in 3 pots, or if, like me, you
  like to keep pots to a minimum, use the method given.  This is the way they
  prepare it in Egypt anyway.
  
  Place lentils in a sieve and wash well under running water.  Place in a
  large pot and add 3 cups water and 1 teaspoon salt.  Bring to the boil,
  then simmer for 1 hour until tender but still intact.  Drain and keep
  aside.
  
  Clean same pot and add 4 cups water.  Bring to the boil, add 2 teaspoons
  salt and the macaroni.  Stir constantly until water returns to the boil and
  cook, uncovered, for 15 minutes until tender.  Stir occasionally. Drain and
  keep aside.  Clean pot again and dry.
  
  Wash rice well in sieve under running water and drain.  Heat oil in pot and
  fry rice over medium heat for 2-3 minutes.  Add 2 cups water and 1 teaspoon
  salt and bring to the boil, stirring occasionally.  Cover and simmer over
  low heat for 15 minutes or until tender.  Leave covered off the heat for 5
  minutes for grains to separate.
  
  Prepare the ta'leya (directions below), add tomato puree and bring to the
  boil.
  
  Add lentils and macaroni to cooked rice and toss together lightly with a
  fork.  Pour hot ta'leya and tomato mixture on top, toss again and cover
  pot.  Leave over low heat for 10 minutes.  Serve hot.
  
  TA'LEYA: Halve peeled onions lengthwise then slice thinly to give
  semicircles.  Heat olive oil in a pan, add onions and fry over medium heat
  until golden brown.  Add garlic and cook a minute longer.

      1 ts Dried celery seed
      2 tb Fresh rosemary leaves
           -- chopped
      2 ts Salt
      2 c  Chopped seitan (optional)

-------------------------------MUSHROOM GRAVY-------------------------------
     20 md Mushrooms
    1/2 c  Chopped onion
      1 tb Olive oil
    1/2 ts Dried oregano; -OR-
      2 ts -Fresh oregano
    1/3 c  Butter
    1/2 c  Unbleached flour
      2 c  -Lentil liquor (from above)
  1 1/2 c  Water
      1 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Black pepper
 
  Cook the lentils, millet, and brown rice separately; and reserve two cups
  of the lentil liquor for making Mushroom Gravy.  If you are using whole
  chestnuts, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Rinse the nuts and cut a
  cross about 1/2 inch deep in the small, pointed ends.  Place the nuts on a
  cookie sheet and bake about 20 minutes, then cool for about 10 minutes.
  Remove the shells and cut the nuts in quarters.
  
  Mix the cooked grains and lentils with the nuts, bread crumbs, and almond
  butter in a large bowl and set aside.
  
  Saute the onions briefly in olive oil, then add the garlic, sage, celery
  seed, rosemary, salt, and seitan if used.  Saute 2 to 3 minutes longer,
  stirring constantly, then add to the other ingredients, mix thoroughly
  (mooshing with fingers works best), and put into a large oiled baking dish.
  Lightly coat the top of the roast with olive oil, then bake at 350 degrees
  F for 1-1/4 hours.  Serve with Mushroom Gravy (below) and garnish with
  parsley.
  
  MUSHROOM GRAVY: Separate the mushroom caps from the stems, then quarter the
  caps and halve the stems.  Saute the onion in olive oil on medium heat for
  1 minute, then stir in the oregano and add the mushrooms.  Cook, stirring
  constantly, until the mushrooms have softened and the bottom of the pan is
  covered with liquid.  Set aside.
  
  Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat, then stir in the flour and
  cook, stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes.  Add the lentil liquor and
  water, and continue stirring until the mixture thickens and barely begins
  to boil.  Add the mushroom mixture, salt, and pepper, and continue stirring
  until the gravy begins to boil.  Remove from heat and serve.

      Title: LENTIL-WALNUT BURGERS
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    3/4 c  Dry lentils
  1 1/2 c  Water
      2 ts Cider vinegar
      1 tb Butter
      1 c  Onion; finely minced
      2    Garlic cloves; crushed
     10 lg Mushrooms; minced
    1/2 c  Walnuts; finely minced
      1 sm Celery stalk; finely minced
      1 ts Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 ts Dry mustard
      1 tb Dry sherry
    1/2 c  Raw wheat germ
 
   This takes about 40 minutes to prepare: you can do "part 1" while "part 2"
  is cooking, plus about 1 hour to chill, then 15 minutes to cook.
  
   Makes between 4 to 6 servings, depending on the size of patties you make
  and the hunger of participants.
  
   Note: uncooked burgers may be individually wrapped and frozen.
  
  Part 1:  Bring lentils and water to a boil in saucepan. Lower the heat, and
  simmer, partly-covered, 30 minutes, or until lentils are soft, and liquid
  is gone. Place in large-ish bowl. Add vinegar, and mash.
  
  Part 2:  Saute remaining ingredients, except for wheat germ, together over
  medium-low heat 10 to 15 minutes, or until all is tender. Add to the mashed
  lentils, and mix well. Add wheat germ and mix again. Chill for about 1
  hour.
  
  The Burgers:
  
   1. Make 4-inch patties from chilled burger-mixture. For freezing, make
  patties, place wax paper between each patty and stack; wrap well and freeze
  (or wrap individually).
  
   2. Fry burgers in butter until brown, *or* broil about 8 minutes on each
  side.  Try putting sesame seeds in pan to keep burgers from sticking to
  pan, if it is a problem.
  
   3. Serve either as patties, or as burgers in a whole-wheat bun. Good with
  cheese melted on top, basil sprinkled on each burger is tasty also.
  
  I think I got this one out of the Moosewood Cookbook a few years back...

      1    Carrot, chopped

      2 oz Breadcrumbs
           ---Yogurt sauce
           Oil for frying
    1/2 pt Yogurt
      2 tb Parsley
      1 tb Chives
      1    Garlic clove, crushed
    1/4 ts Cumin
           Lemon juice

  Put lentils & hot water into a pot.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat & simmer,
  covered for 30 minutes.
  
  Heat margarine in a skillet, add onion & cook for 2 minutes. Add carrot &
  pepper & cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add spices, paste,
  salt & pepper. Mix together well.Then stir in lentils & let cool. Mix in
  parsley.
  
  Divide the mixture into 12 equal portions & shape into rounds. Coat them in
  combined breadcrumbs & oats (oats may have to be blended to resemble fine
  breadcrumbs). Shallow fry in hot oil until golden brown on both sides.
  Drain well.
  
  For the yogurt sauce, combine all the ingredients & chill till ready to
  serve.
  
  I find that I do not need to roll the rissoles in egg, though the recipe
  calls for it.

      Title: MJADDRA (LENTILS WITH RICE)
 Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 c  Lentils
    3/4 c  Uncooked rice
      2 md Onions; chopped
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      1 tb Salt
    1/4 ts Cumin
    1/2 ts Allspice or bhar
 
  Clean and wash the lentils and boil them until tender. Mash and strain into
  a separate pot.  Add the rice, salt, and spices, and mix well. In a pan,
  saute the chopped onions in oil until golden. Add them with the frying oil
  to the lentils and rice.  Bring the mixture to the boil with enough water
  to cover and simmer over low heat for about 10 minutes, until the rice is
  cooked, stirring regularly to prevent sticking.  Serve lukewarm or cold
  with radishes and spring onions or a cabbage salad.
  
  That's the recipe straight from the book.  I make a couple changes: first
  of all, I'm a bit liberal with the cumin and allspice - I don't use
  measuring spoons, and I'm sure I get more than the 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon.
  Bhar, btw, is described by the book as "a spice blend made of cloves,
  cinnamon and nutmeg.  It is very similar in flavor to allspice, which may
  be substituted for it." I use brown basmati rice, so I have to boil it for
  more than 10 minutes; this means I have to keep adding water to it so it
  doesn't dry out.
  
  I mean to go back to the restaurant I first had this dish at and ask them
  what spices they use, since theirs is both spicier and darker than mine.

      Title: YEMISER W'ET (SPICY LENTIL STEW)
 Categories: Vegetarian, Vegetables
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 c  Dried brown lentils
      1 c  Onions, finely chopped
      2    Clove garlic, pressed
    1/4 c  Niter Kebbeh
      1 tb Berbere
      1 ts Ground cumin seeds
      1 tb Sweet Hungarian paprika
      2 c  Tomatoes, finely chopped
    1/4 c  Tomato paste
      1 c  Vegetable stock or water
      1 c  Green peas (fresh or frozen)
           Salt and pepper to taste
 
  Rinse and cook the lentils.  Bring to boil in 3 cups water.  Reduce heat to
  a simmer.  Simmer about 30 minutes, adding more water if necessary, until
  lentils are tender.   Should make about 3 cups cooked lentils.
  
  Meanwhile, saute the onions and garlic in the niter kebbeh, until the
  onions are just translucent.  Add the berbere, cumin, and paprika and saute
  for a few minutes more, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Mix in
  the chopped tomatoes and tomato paste and simmer for another 5 to 10
  minutes.  Add 1 cup of vegetable stock or water and continue simmering.
  
  When the lentils are cooked, drain them and mix them into the saute
  mixture.  Add the green peas and cook for another 5 minutes.  Add salt and
  pepper to taste.
  
  To serve Yemiser W'et, spread layers of injera on individual plates. Place
  some yogurt of cottage cheese alongside a serving of w'et on the injera and
  pass more injera at the table.  To eat, tear off pieces of injera, fold it
  around bits of stew, and, yes, eat it with your fingers.

      Title: YELLOW TOOR DAAL
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetables, Vegetarian, Indian
      Yield: 3 servings
 
    1/2 c  Toor daal
           -OR- mung beans or lentils
  1 1/2 c  Water
    1/2 tb Vegetable oil
      1 ts Cumin seeds
    1/8 ts Asafetida or "hing" (opt.)
      1 sm Dry, whole red chili
      1 ts Salt
    3/4 ts Fresh green serrano chilies
           - (minced)
      2 ts Brown sugar or honey (opt.)
    1/2 ts Turmeric powder
      2 tb Tomatoes, chopped
      1 tb Fresh cilantro, chopped
           - (optional)
      1 tb Yogurt; -OR-
    1/2 ts Lemon or lime juice
 
  'Daal' refers to a variety of lentils, peas and beans that are used to make
  soups and stews also known as 'daal'.  This recipe calls for 'toor daal',
  split yellow pigeon peas, but you can substitute mung beans or red lentils.
  Vaghar, the method used here to saute spices in oil is a basic Gujarati
  cooking technique used in making most dishes.
  
  DIRECTIONS: =========== Cover daal with water and soak 30 minutes. If using
  a pressure cooker, reduce soaking time to 10 minutes. Discard soaking water
  in a large saucepan or pressure cooker. Cook 50 minutes by conventional
  method or 15 minutes in a pressure cooker.  If using red lentils, cook 30
  minutes by conventional method or 10 minutes in pressure cooker. For a
  souplike consistency, add 1/4 to 1/2 cup more water if needed. Puree daal
  with a handheld electric blender or in a food processor.
  
  Heat oil in a small skillet over medium heat.  Add cumin seeds and
  asafetida.  Cook until cumin seeds turn golden brown, about 1 minute. Add
  to the daal and bring to a boil.
  
  Stir in chilies, salt, sugar, turmeric and tomatoes.  Lower heat and simmer
  uncovered 5 minutes.  Remove daal from heat.  Stir in cilantro and yogurt
  or lemon juice and serve immediately.

  Saute onion and tomato in oil until onion is golden and tomato is soft. In
  a bowl mash up the cooked lentils a little. Add onion & tomato; mix in
  garlic powder, salt, milk, cheese, and 1 cup of the bread crumbs. Preheat
  oven to 350. Glop mixture into oiled loaf pan, sprinkle remaining crumbs on
  top and bake for 1/2 hour or until done. You could add a Tbs. of
  ketchup...you could put just about anything in there (celery, bell
  pepper...) Tonight I'm going to beat one egg and mix it in to make the loaf
  stick together better. And maybe add a touch of ketchup or BBQ sauce or
  something. You can serve with any sauce or gravy or anything.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 c  Green Lentils; dried
    1/4 c  Pinto Beans; dried
    1/4 c  Red Kidney Beans; dried
    1/4 c  Baby Lima Beans; dried
      1    Onion; medium
      4    Garlic Cloves
      2    Jalapeno Peppers *
      1 tb Oregano; dried
      1 tb Chili Powder
    1/4 c  Coriander Leaves; chopped
      6 oz Monterey Jack Cheese; grated
      6    Flour Tortillas; 10"
      1    Tomato; medium, chopped
      1    Lettuce; shredded
      1    Salsa
 
  Servings:  4
  
  Rinse lentils and beans, discarding any that look suspicious, and soak in
  clean water 4 - 6 hours, or overnight.  Put into medium saucepan, bring to
  boil and simmer, covered, 30 minutes.  Add water if necessary.
  
  Peel and chop onion.  Microwave on "High" 2 - 2 1/2 minutes until soft. [If
  you prefer, you may saute the onion in about 2 T. oil.  I omit the oil to
  keep the fat content down.  The flavour does not seem to suffer.] Chop the
  Jalapena pepper.  (*) Adjust the quantity to your own taste and / or
  tolerance.
  
  Peel and crush the garlic.
  
  Drain the lentil-bean mixture.  Reserve 1/2 cup of liquor.  In a food
  processor puree the lentil-bean mixture, the onion, the garlic, the
  jalapena peppers, the oregano, the chile powder, and the coriander leaves,
  adding some of the reserved liquor as necessary to process.  [The final
  puree should be quite thick.]
  
  Pre-heat the oven to 325 F.
  
  Assemble as follows on an oven-proof plate, pizza-pan or cookie-sheet:
  
  Place a flour tortilla on the *lightly* greased surface. Cover with
  lentil-bean puree [4 - 5 T.].  Sprinkle with Monterey Jack cheese. Add
  another flour tortilla and repeat, saving enough cheese to cover the top of
  the final flour tortilla.  Bake for 20 - 30 minutes.
  
  Remove from oven and allow to "firm-up" for 5 - 10 minutes before serving.
  
  Garnish with salsa, chopped tomato and shredded lettuce.  Serve with rice,
  Couscous and / or corn.
  
  The amount of oregano, coriander leaves, chile powder, or jalapena peppers
  may be varied to suit individual tastes.  I use more peppers!  If you're
  prone to "problems" with beans, add 1/4 - 1/2 t. Hing [Hing is a mixture of
  rice-flour, turmeric and asafoetida <ass-uh-fuh-TEE-duh> found in most
  East-Indian specialty stores.  It can significantly reduce flatulence.

    1/4 ts Dried oregano, Mexican if
           -possible
      1    Whole clove
  1 1/2    Inch cinnamon stick
      1 tb Melted lard or safflower oil
      1 md Plantain (about 8-oz),
           -peeled and cut into
    1/4    Inch cubes
      2    Thick pineapple slices,
           -peeled, cored, and cut into
           Small triangular wedges
 
  Serves 4 to 6
  
  LENTILS:
  
  Run the lentils through your hands to make sure there are no stones or
  other foreign bodies in them.  Rinse them in two changes of water and put
  into a pan.  Add onion, salt to taste, and enough water to come about 2
  inches above the surface of the lentils.  Set over medium heat and bring to
  a fast simmer.  Continue simmering until the lentils are quite soft - about
  3 hours, depending on their age.  Keep a pan of near-boiling water on the
  side, ready to add if necessary.
  
  Put the pork pieces into a pan; add salt to taste and water to cover. Bring
  to a fast simmer and continue simmering until the pork is tender but not
  soft - about 25 minutes.  Strain, reserving the broth, and set broth and
  meat aside.
  
  Cover the dried chilies with boiling water and leave to soak for about 15
  minutes, until the chilies have softened and become fleshy. Drain and put
  into a blender with 1 cup of the reserved pork broth, the broiled tomatoes,
  garlic, oregano, clove, and cinnamon; blend until smooth, adding more broth
  only if needed to release the blades of the blender.
  
  Heat the lard in a small frying pan, add the blended ingredients, and fry
  over medium heat, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan, until
  reduced and well seasoned - about 4 minutes.  Add to the lentils and add
  the pork, remaining broth, plantain, and pineapple; simmer together for
  about 30 minutes.  Adjust salt and add water if necessary. The mixture
  should be like a thick soup.

      1 tb Raisins; or sultanas
      2 tb Bread crumbs
      1 bn Parsley, fresh; chopped
           -salt and pepper
 
  " This is a vegetarian version of a Bedouin dish. If you serve it with
  rice, try adding saffron or tumeric to the rice before cooking. It adds a
  distinctive flavor as well as color, creating 'red' rice."
    Peel the onions and place them in a large pan of boiling water. Reduce
  the heat and let them simmer for 15-20 minutes, covered, until they are
  fairly tender. When they are ready, take them out and set aside to cool.
    Now remove the centre section of each onion, to leave a shell about 3/4
  inch thick.
    In a bowl, mix together the lentils, pepper, salt, yogurt, dates,
  walnuts, raisins or sultanas and bread crumbs.
    Fill the onions with this mixture. Keep any that remains and mix it with
  the chopped discarded onion centres.
    Place the filled onions in an oven proof dish, spoon any remaining
  mixture around them and cook for about 20 minutes. Garnish with parsley
  ands serve with bulgur or 'red' rice (see note above).

      1 lb Dry lentils
           Cold water
      2 lb Fresh italian sausage, sweet
           Or hot
           About 3 cups homemade or
           Canned chicken broth
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      1 sm Onion, finely chopped
      1    Rib celery, finely chopped
      1    Carrot, finely chopped
      2    Cloves garlic, finely minced
      8    Fresh sage leaves, chopped,
           Or 1 tsp. dried, rubbed sage
           Salt and pepper to taste
      3 tb Tomato paste, diluted in a
           Little water
 
  Clean lentils well by soaking them briefly and changing the water at least
  once.  Put them in a 2-1/2-quart saucepan, add cold water to cover, and
  bring to a boil.  Lower heat to simmer and cook until not quite done, about
  45 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, pierce sausages in several places, and then put them in a small
  saucepan.  Add enough chicken broth to cover, and place over medium heat.
  Bring to a gentle boil, and simmer for about 40 minutes.  From time to
  time, skim off and discard foam and fat that rise to the top.  When
  sausages are done, remove the pot from the heat and let them sit in the
  broth while you finish the lentils.
  
  Warm the oil in a medium skillet, and saute' the onion, celery, carrot,
  garlic and sage in the olive oil over medium heat until the onion is
  translucent and the vegetables are done.  Drain the lentils, saving their
  liquid.  To the lentil pot, add the vegetables, season with salt and
  pepper, and add tomato paste.  Mix gently using a wooden spoon.  Add 3/4
  cup of the broth in which you cooked the sausages.  Taste and adjust the
  seasoning, if needed.
  
  To serve, slice the sausages and arrange them on a platter next to the warm
  lentils.

 Categories: Soups/stews
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 l  Brown lentils
      2 l  Water
    1/4 l  Finely chopped spring onions
      1    Garlic clove (opt.); crushed
    1/2 dl Finely chopped coriander *
    3/4 dl Olive oil
    1/2 dl Cold water
      1 tb Flour
    1/2 dl Vinegar (or to taste)
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
 
  *Note: Finely chopped parsley may be substituted for coriander leaves.
  
  Wash lentils in several changes of cold water, or place in a sieve and run
  water through them.  Drain.
  
  Put lentils in a large pot with 8 cups water, spring onion, garlic if used,
  oil and coriander or parsley (or a combination of the two if preferred).
  Bring to the boil, cover pan and simmer on low heat for 1 hour or until
  lentils are soft.

      Title: GREEN LENTIL RISSOLES WITH VEGAN YOGURT SAUCE
 Categories: Main dish, British, Vegetarian
      Yield: 6 servings
 
----------------------------------RISSOLES----------------------------------
      8 oz Green lentils
      1 pt Hot water
      2 oz Margarine
      1 ea Onion, finely chopped
      1 ea Carrot, finely chopped
      1 ea Green bell pepper, diced
      2 ea Garlic cloves, crushed
    1/4 ts Cayenne
    1/2 ts Coriander
    1/2 ts Cumin
    1/2 ts Curry powder
      2 ts Tomato paste
           Salt & pepper, to taste
      1 tb Parsley, chopped

----------------------------------COATING----------------------------------
           Vegetable oil
      2 oz Wholewheat flour
      2 oz Breadcrumbs
      2 oz Oats

--------------------------------YOGURT SAUCE--------------------------------
    1/2 pt Plain soy yogurt
      2 tb Parsley, chopped
      1 tb Chives
      1 ea Garlic clove, crushed
    1/4 ts Cumin
           Lemon juice, to taste
           Salt & pepper
 
  RISSOLES: Combine lentils & water, bring to a boil, reduce heat &
  simmer for 30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender (I think it
  needs closer to an hour to get them really tender).  Add more water
  if necessary.
  Heat the margarine, add the onion & cook for a couple of minutes.
  Add the carrot & pepper & cook until tender, about 10 minutes.  Add
  the spices, tomato paste & salt & pepper.  Mix together well & stir
  in the lentils. Add the parsley.  Allow to cool till it is cool
  enough to handle.
  Divide the mixture into 12 portions & shape into patties.  Coat them
  in flour, dip in some oil & coat in the breadcrumbs & oats (I omitted
  this step).  Shallow fry in hot oil until the patties are golden
  brown on both sides.  Drain well & serve with the sauce.
  SAUCE: Combine all ingredients together & chill.
  MARK'S NOTE: The vegetables do need to be finely diced, it may well be
  easier to use a food processor.  Also, if using the oats, I'd
  recommend running them through the processor too so that they
  resemble oat flour.

      Title: LENTIL AND SPINACH SOUP, ADAS BI SABAANIKH (V
 Categories: Soups, Prodigy, Dec.
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Dried lentils
      8 c  Water
      1 lg Onion; chopped
      3    Garlic cloves; crushed
      6 oz Tomato paste
      2 bn Spinach; cleaned & chopped
    1/2 c  Fresh parsley
    1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper
    1/8 ts Crushed red hot pepper flake
    1/4 c  Fresh lemon juice
 
  This is a Middle Eastern soup, typical of the simple
  foods served in the desert regions. Serve with pita
  bread and a grain or vegetable dish for a simple meal.
  This soup is also food served cold, stuffed into a
  pita bread. Place the lentils and water in a large
  pot. Bring to a boil, cover, and cook for 30 minutes
  over medium low heat. Add the onion , tomato paste and
  garlic and cook an additional 30 minutes. Add the
  spinach, parsley, and peppers. Mix well and cook for
  another 10 minutes. Add the lemon juice just before
  serving. Mix in well and serve at once. I added a bit
  of fresh ground nutmeg & salt to taste. Note: I have
  found that balsamic vinegar in place of lemon juice is
  wonderful with lentils and imparts a slightly sweet
  taste... Nutrition (per serving): 251 calories Total

  pan or can be done on a vegetable grill on an outdoor

  lentils and water. Bring to a boil stirring

      Title: WHOLE-GRAIN BREAKFAST CEREAL
 Categories: Breakfast, Digest
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Whole wheat berries
      1 c  Whole rye berries
      1 c  Whole triticale
      1 c  Whole barley
      1 c  Brown rice
      1 c  Buckwheat groats
      1 c  Millet
      1 c  Sesame seeds
      1 c  Flaxseed
      1 c  Lentils
     10 c  Oat groats
 
  I mix it up, then cook a pot of it by measuring 2 cups of cereal to 5 cups
  of water, bringing it to boil, & then letting it sit over night. Then I
  have a bowlful each morning, heated in the microwave until the cooked
  cereal is gone and I need to make more. Or you could do the same with a
  smaller amount, for one serving, say, try 1/4 cup of cereal. It's very
  chewy and satisfying. And of course lots of whole grains. Sometimes I just
  use oatmeal instead of oat groats, since they are difficult to find and I
  like the consistency that oatmeal adds. In the book he has a little
  paragraph about each grain, explaining what vitamins/minerals it has & what
  it's good for.

      Title: EGGPLANT DAL SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces, Indian, Digest
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 md Eggplant
    2/3 c  Red lentils
      2 c  Water
      2 t  Black mustard seeds
      1 t  Coriander
      1 t  Cumin
      1    Cinnamon stick
      1    Dried red chili
           -cayenne pepper to taste
           -salt to taste
 
  Roast the eggplant in a 400-degree oven for an hour (stab it first with a
  fork).  A half hour or twenty minutes before you anticipate the eggplant
  will be done, pop the mustard seeds in a medium sized saucepan, then add
  lentils, water and spices.  Bring to a boil and gently simmer until the
  eggplant is finished cooking, then remove eggplant from oven, slit open,
  scoop out innards, chop them coarsely and add to lentils.  Cook another
  5-10 minutes to blend all the flavors.  This would probably make a
  respectable soup if it were thinned out with more water and broth, but I
  served it over...
  
  > Kirsten, your recipe for eggplant dal sounds delicious, but would you
  explain > how to "pop" mustard seeds? Also, you call for black mustard seed
  ~ how is > that different in flavor from regular mustard seed? Do you find
  them at your > HFS, or do normal grocery stores carry them? > I pop the
  seeds by putting them in a heavy wok with a lid.  I spray a little bit of
  Pam first.  The brown or black mustard seeds can usually be gotten at a HFS
  or an Indian grocery store.  These are the only kinds of seeds I have ever
  tasted so I can't comment on whether the flavor is different but they add
  substantially to the flavor of an Indian type dish.

      Title: DENVER GRAINLETTE
 Categories: Vegetarian, Digest
      Yield: 2 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Grain & lentil mix*
    2/3 c  Chopped fresh tomato
    1/2 c  Chopped green bell pepper
      1    Sliced green onion
    2/3 c  Sliced fresh mushrooms
    1/4 c  Water
      1    Clove fresh garlic, minced
           -or crushed.
 
  Put the water in a skillet.  Toss in everything above except the grains.
  Cook down until the water's almost gone.  (If you like the peppers less
  cooked add them after a couple of minutes.) Toss in the grain mix, stir,
  maybe add a grind or two of fresh pepper, serve. Serves two or one really
  hungry person.
  
  * The grain mix:  I steam 1/2 cup wild and brown basmati rice, 1/4 cup
  barley, 1/4 cup lentils and about 1/4 cup millet together, then use it in
  all sorts of recipes like this one.
  
  To make it even more like a Denver omelette, you could add no-fat cheese,
  but that makes such a mess of the skillet that I didn't bother!
  
  I liked this.  HAving leftovers for lunch just as soon as I get off line!

  1. Rinse lentils and cook in 1 1/2 cups of veggie stock. (I used a rice
  cooker for this step.)
  
  2. While the lentils are cooking cut the stems off of the kale. Chop stems
  into 1/2 - 1 inch peices
  
  3. Chop the red bell pepper.
  
  4. Put pepper and stems in large pan with enough stock to cover the bottom
  of the pan (1/4"?) and cook on medium for a couple of minutes then turn
  flame all the way down.
  
  5. While the peppers etc. are cooking wash and chop mushrooms. Add to pan.
  
  6. Around 20-30 minutes after step 1. (probably 5-10 minutes after end of
  step 5.) pour the lentils into the pan.  If you are using the rice cooker,
  just shut it off manually - don't wait for it to finish.
  
  7. Add cinnamon and other spices (see note).  Stir mixture in pan then add
  the kale leaves on top - this will steam the leaves, don't mix them in.
  
  8. Cook for another 15 minutes or so until the leaves have a buttery taste.
  
  9. Remove the kale from the top and serve separately.
  
  Have some black pepper available on the table for the lentil stew. Try the
  kale leaves with some nutritional yeast...
  
  NOTES: * If you don't have stock handy try adding alot of spices in step 7.
  Try oregano, chile passilla, roasted garlic, etc. * Use wild mushrooms if
  at all possible - they are more expensive than buttons (unless you or
  friends go mushrooming) but are worth it for the extra taste. (IMHO, of
  course. ;-) * Purple kale - you know, the type they use as a decoration in
  salad bars... Shared by J. Ari Kornfeld

      Title: BURGER MIX
 Categories: Digest
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 c  Dry chickpeas
    1/2 c  Dry soybeans
    1/2 c  Dry lentils
    1/2 c  Yellow split peas
    1/2 c  Brown rice
    1/2 c  Rolled oats
    1/4 c  Whole wheat bread crumbs
    1/4 c  Cornmeal
  1 1/2 T  Baking soda
        x  Seasonings of your choice
           (see note)
 
  Put the ingredients 1-2 at a time in a blender, turn the blender on, and
  RUN FOR COVER (this is pretty noisy <g>).  When everything is in powdered
  form, combine in a tupperware container and store in the fridge.  Makes 4
  cups of mix.
  
  To make burgers, combine 1 c. burger mix and 2/3 c. HOT liquid (see note 2)
  and let sit for 15 minutes.  On a plate, form into 3 thin patties.  Use a
  spatula to move patties onto a nonstick-sprayed skillet and cook on both
  sides until lightly browned.  Serve with your favorite burger fixins.
  
  Note - Seasonings:  You can use the herbs and/or spices of your choice, or
  consider using a dry soup mix run through the blender (I'll bet onion would
  be good).  Also, try a dry FF salad dressing mix.  Or a veggie boullion
  cube run through the blender.  Other suggestions:  onion powder, garlic
  powder, lemon pepper, basil, etc.
  
  Note - Liquids:  Try 1/3 c. water and 1/3 c. barbeque sauce - combine in
  bowl and nuke until hot , add to dry mix (note that burgers made with
  barbeque sauce will brown more quickly, so watch them!).  Or try half
  water, half tomato juice, or half water and half white wine or marsala. Try
  to make sure that your liquids and seasonings have compatible flavors.
  
  Other suggestions:  The possibilities here are endless
  :)
  
  Oriental:  Burger mix with a little soy sauce in the liquid and some fresh
  ginger added to the mix, maybe a dash of rice wine.
  
  Spanish:  Cumin, red pepper, chili powder, or a dry taco seasoning mix.
  
  Indian:  Curry powder added to the mix.
  
  Wine/garlic:  Chopped garlic added to the mix, half water and half white
  wine for the liquid.
  
  Potpourri:  Make a batch of plain, unseasoned burger mix and add whatever
  seasonings strike your fancy as you're mixing it up!  No need to commit to
  just one flavor for the whole batch!

      Title: LENTILS WITH SUMMER VEGETABLES
 Categories: Digest, July
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 c  Lentils (any color), rinsed
           And drained
      1 md Onion, chopped
      2 md Carrots, chopped
      2    Stalks celery, chopped
      1 md Zucchini, quartered and
           Sliced
      1    1 1/2 tsp summer savory
        x  Black pepper
        x  Dried garlic  [I'm out of
           Fresh :-( ]
      1    Bay leaf
      5 c  Water (or use part broth if
           You want)
 
  Put everything in a large pot, bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and
  simmer about 30-40 minutes.  Remove bay leaf.  Serve over brown rice (or
  maybe potatoes). Makes 4 reasonably sized servings.
  
  The vegetables used were the ones I happened to have on hand.  Vary to suit
  yourself.  Leeks are great in this.  If I want this to be more soup-like, I
  add more water and a can of tomatoes, pureed.  I've also put potatoes in
  the pot with the rest of the veggies.  The possibilities are endless...

      Title: LENTIL AND LEEK RISOTTO [T]
 Categories: Digest, July
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      4    Chopped leeks (green and
           White parts, well washed)
      4    Cloves garlic, minced
      1    Red pepper, finely chopped
      3 c  Vegetable broth or water
  1 1/4 c  Brown rice
        x  Salt and pepper to taste
      1 T  Approx. chopped fresh basil
           Or a pinch dried basil
      1 c  Cooked lentils
    1/4 c  Freshly chopped parsley
    1/4 c  Finely grated carrots
 
  In a 4 quart deep pot with cover, saute leeks, garlic and red pepper in a
  small amount of the broth.  When soft, add the rest of the broth or water,
  and stir in rice along with seasonings. Reduce heat and simmer covered for
  about 40 minutes or until rice is done. Uncover, stir in cooked lentils and
  reheat until lentils are hot. Garnish with parsley and grated carrot before
  serving.
  
  *I deleted 1T of olive oil for sauteing, so the nutritional information of
  368 total calories and 6g of fat is off by whatever 1T olive oil accounts
  for.
   I also changed 1 clove garlic to 4, and 2 leeks to 4. It was too mild for
  me in it's original incarnation. I also liked it better with basmati brown
  rice, though the dish then became a pseudorisotto in texture.
  
  Delicious and easy if you keep cooked lentils around!

      Title: CROCKPOT BEANS AND BARLEY
 Categories: Digest, July, Slow cooker
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Onion, chopped
      1    Carrot, chopped (I used 2, I
           Like them)
      1 c  Navy beans, soaked

    1/2 c  Split peas, dried
    1/4 c  Pearl barley
    1/2 c  Mushrooms, chopped
      1 c  Pinto beans, uncooked
      4 c  Vegetable broth
      3 T  Parsley, minced
    1/4 c  Lentils, dried
 
  Soak white and pinto beans overnight. Saute onion, mushrooms and carrot in
  1 T of vegetable broth until tender. Add drained beans, vegetable bouillon,
  mustard and parsely, bring to bil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer 45
  minutes. Add split peas, lentils and barley. Cover and simmer another hour
  until all beans are tender. (Note: I like it spicy so I added lots of
  tabasco and pepper). I know this is more of a "winter recipe" but I think
  it will be good cold, also. Things got a bit mushy in the crockpot so it
  might be better to cook on the stove.

      Title: LENTIL AND WHEATBERRY SALAD
 Categories: Digest, August
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Wheat berries
      2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Lentils (this was all I had
           On hand--more would be
           Better)
      1 c  Water
        x  Assorted vegetables
        x  Herbs
        x  Fatfree dressing
 
  Put wheat berries and 2 cups water in a saucepan, bring to a boil, reduce
  heat, cover and simmer 45 min to 1 hour, until berries are tender, but
  still chewy (not mushy).
  
  Sort lentils, removing any deformed ones and any stones that may be mixed
  in. Rinse a couple of times, then put them in saucepan with 1 cup of water,
  bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer about 30 minutes, again, so
  they are done but not mushy.
  
  When both lentils and wheatberries are done, drain any excess water, put
  into large bowl and chill while you cut up vegetables.  Vegetables can vary
  according to what you have on hand.  I used:
  
  yellow summer squash green pepper sweet onion peas (I used frozen peas,
  straight from the bag--they helped chill the lentils and wheatberries while
  thawing) mushrooms parsley (1-2 Tbsp chopped fresh) basil (1 Tbsp chopped
  fresh)
  
  For a dressing I used some 7-Seas fatfree red wine vinegar dressing--just
  enough to coat everything, but not so much that it was swimming in
  dressing.  The bits of red pepper in the dressing also added a little more
  color to the salad. (I would have added some chopped tomato, but we were
  out.) Toss everything together well and chill (if you have time; I only
  chilled it about 15 minutes last night--but the veggies were all cold when
  I added them--and the frozen peas helped out, too).  I served this with a
  crusty sourdough bread.  It made 3 servings. (Two for us last night, with
  enough left for my lunch today.)

      1 c  Whole wheat
      1 c  Brown rice
      1 c  White rice
      1 c  Black beans
      1 c  Lentils
      1 c  Oatmeal
 
  Whir grains one at a time in blender until coarsely chopped.  mix well and
  store in a covered container.
  
  When you want a veggie burger scoop out needed amount <1 cup makes 4 good
  sized burgers>  whir 1 cup at a time in blender until reasonably fine.
  
  Heat 1 cup of water for each cup of mix until boiling add seasonings <see
  below> add to dry mixture and stir until liquid is absorbed.  Drop by large
  spoonsfull into nonstick fry pan <or use pam>  it will firm up as it cooks.
  Its gloppy to start with. That's ok. Turn when brown on bottom. serve as
  pleases you.
  
  For a more tender pancake like burger use a little more water.
  
  beef, chicken, or ham flavored burgers.  Use 2 TBS <more or less to taste>
  soup starter for each cup of water.  Serve on buns with lettuce tomatoe,
  onion, ketchup, mustard or whatever strikes your fancy.  For cheeseburgers
  use FF cheese.
  
  Taco burgers add 1/2 pkt taco seasonings to each cup of water. serve with
  salsa or stir fry to a chunky consistancy and make tacos
  
  hawaiian burgers use pineapple juice in place of 1/2 the water add a dash
  of soy sauce. Serve with pineapple rings.
  
  sloppy joes  use 1/2 c. sloppy joe mix for each cup of water stir fry to
  chuncky consistancy. Serve on whole wheat buns.
  
  sweet and sour burgers.  Use soy sauce in place of 1/4 water.  Serve with
  sweet and sour sauce. There are many FF versions on the market or you can
  make your own.  I have a recipe somewhere I can look up if anyone is
  interested.

      Title: LENTIL AND CORN SOUP
 Categories: Digest, Sept.
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 md Onion, chopped
      2 md Carrots, sliced
      2 T  Water, stock, or sherry for
           Sauteing
      7 c  Water
    3/4 c  Dried lentils
      2 md Tomatoes
      1 c  Fresh or frozen corn
      1 sm Sweet potato, diced
      4 t  Tamari or soy sauce
      1 c  Cooked brown rice
      2 T  Chopped fresh parsley (I
           Double this amount)
 
  Corn and sweet potatoes give this soup a nice sweetness. It's adapted from
  Mark Bricklin's _Lose Weight Naturally Cookbook_ (Rodale), which uses too
  much meat and dairy for our purposes; this one, however, adapts well by
  substituting for the oil in the saute. It also freezes and microwaves well
  for brown-bag lunches.
  
  Saute the onion and carrots in a large saucepan over low heat, stirring
  occasionally, until the onions are translucent.
  
  Add water, lentils, tomatoes, corn, and sweet potato. Bring to a boil,
  reduce heat, cover and simmer for 25 min. Add the tamari, rice and parsley,
  and heat through before serving.

 Categories: Digest, Sept.
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Wild rice
      1 c  Long grain brown rice
      1 c  Green (French) lentils

--------------------------------COMBINE WITH--------------------------------
      1 ea Red, yellow, green bell
           Pepper, chopped
      2 c  Small cherry tomatoes
      1    Or 2 carrots
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh basil (more or
           Less)
      1    To 2 tablespoon or chopped
           Fresh mint

----------------------------------DRESSING----------------------------------
        x  Nonfat tomato-herb
        x  Red wine vinegar
 
  Cook grains separately, in 2 cups water, until done, 45 minutes or less.
  
  For the dressing, I used a prepared nonfat tomato-herb dressing (Trader
  Joe's) mixed about half and half with red wine vinegar because I generally
  find prepared nonfat dressings too thick and too sweet for my taste. I
  didn't measure, but I used perhaps half a cup, maybe as much as a cup,
  total, just enough to moisten everything.
  
  I let it sit in the refrigerator all day, to let the flavors mix. I don't
  know how many people it served--it filled a large bowl-- but there wasn't
  any left over after the potluck (and while I was glad that everyone liked
  it, I was sorry not to have some to take home).

      1 lg Onion, sliced finely
      3    Cloves Garlic, minced
      1    Red chili, deseeded
      2    Stalks Celery, chopped
           *very* finely (because my

    1/2 c  Water
      1 lb Broccoli
      1 sm Courgette/Zucchini
    1/2 lb Mushroom
      1 pt Vegetable Stock (Vecon and
           Water)
      1 c  Red lentils
      1 cn Tomatoes
      2 t  Oregano
      2 t  Basil
    1/2 t  Salt
    1/2 t  Pepper
    1/2 c  Corn
      2 T  Tomato Puree/Paste
     12    Sheets Spinach lasagna
    1/4 c  Water
      2 T  Flour
    3/4 c  Soya milk
      1    Clove Garlic
    1/4 t  Salt
    1/4 t  Pepper
      3 T  Yeast flakes
    1/4 t  Turmeric
 
  Steam onions, garlic, chilli and celery in the half cup of water. Add
  stalks of the broccoli, the courgette and the mushrooms and simmer for
  about five minutes. Add the stock, the canned tomatoes, the herbs, salt and
  pepper, the lentils and the broccoli flowerets. Simmer till the lentils are
  tender. Add the corn and the tomato puree. The resulting mixture should be
  fairly sloppy still because it has to go into the oven for 20 minutes.
  
  In another pan stir the flour into the cold 1/4 cup of water till a paste
  is made. Put on the heat and slowly add the soya milk making sure to avoid
  lumps. Add the crushed clove of garlic, some salt and pepper, the yeast
  flakes and the turmeric. You should end up with a pourable cheeze sauce.
  
  Layer the mixture with the lasagna sheets (I used no-boil spinach lasagna)
  finishing with a layer of lasagna sheets. Cover with the cheeze sauce and
  stick in the oven at about 170 deg. C (330 deg. F) for 20 minutes. Eat with
  a salad.

      1 lg Onion
      2 T  Curry powder
      1 ds Olive oil
      1 c  Lentils
      4 c  Water
 
  1 big onion chopped & sauteed with 2 Tbsp currie powder (I confess to using
  1/4 tsp. extra virgin olive oil here).  Add a cup of lentils and 4 cups of
  water and cook for 2 hours.  Serve over steamed rice (I prefer the sticky
  Jasmine white rice which I buy in 25 pound bags).  I serve it with coleslaw
  made with FF honey/mustard dressing.  Yummy!

 Categories: Digest, Oct.
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3 T  Sherry (or water or stock)
      1 md Onion, chopped
      1    Clove garlic, chopped
      1 c  Chopped up mushrooms (make
           1/4 to 1/2" pieces)
           -- optional
      1 md Carrot, chopped
      1 sm (~1 lb) eggplant, peeled and
           Cubed
      1 c  Lentils
      1 c  Texmati brown rice (or
           Shortgrain)
      1    8 or 10 oz can tomato sauce

      1 t  Dried basil
      1 t  Dried oregano
      2 t  Chopped parsley to taste or
           More (up to 1/3 cup)
 
  Rice Cooker: Put the sherry or stock into the rice cooker with the sherry
  or stock, and turn on the machine. Let the onion saute, as you chop and add
  the garlic, mushrooms, carrot, and eggplant. Give the pot a quick stir as
  you add each vegie. Add water if the vegetables start to stick, Let the
  eggplant cook about a minute or so, then add the lentils, rice, liquids,
  basil, and oregano. Cover, let it cook, and allow to stand about 10 minutes
  when the cooker shuts off. Stir in the parsley and serve.
  
  Slow Cooker: Saute the vegies lightly, then add everything but parsley to
  the crockpot. Cook on low if you want to ignore it all day, or 3-4 hours on
  high. Add parsley and serve.
  
  Stovetop: Saute the vegies, add everything but the parsley, cover and bring
  to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer about 40-45 minutes, or until liquid is
  absorbed. Stir in parsley.

      Title: MASA SOUP <T>(VEGETABLE, LENTIL AND PEA SOUP)
 Categories: Digest, Oct.
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 md Onion
      3    Cloves garlic
      1 c  Split peas
    1/2 c  Lentils (any color)
  2 1/2 c  Edible hibuscus leaves,
           Spinach, kale, collard or
           Mustard
           Greens, etc., cut or torn in
      2    Inch pieces
    1/2 c  Zucchini, chopped
      1 c  Carrots, diced
    1/2 c  Celery, diced
    1/2 c  Eggplant, diced (optional)
      3 lg Fresh basil leaves (or 1/2
        t  Dried)
      1 pn (1/4 teaspoon) thyme
    1/2 t  Salt (or 2 tablespoons
           Bragg's Liquid Amino)
    1/2 t  Fresh ground black pepper
        x  Chili peppers or hot sauce
           To taste (opt)
 
  This is the good part. Saute onions and garlic in water till starting to
  turn yellow, add all other ingredients in a large pot with 2 1/2 cups of
  water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, simmer an hour (or until peas are
  tender) and then puree in a blender. That's it!
  
  Serve as a main meal with whole wheat pita bread. For a variation, sprinkle
  fresh ripe diced tomato on top of soup (or this can be blended in earlier).
  For those who remember the days when pea soup used to have h*m or b*c*n in
  it, soy baco-bits, sprinkled in just before serving, brings back that aura.

  leftover, I stuff the pocket with both.   Mmmm!   Enjoy!

 Categories: Digest, Jan., Pressure co
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 T  Broth or water
    1/4 c  Coarsely chopped garlic
      2 c  Thinly sliced leeks (white
           And light green parts)
           Or coarsely chopped onions
      2 lg Carrots, halved lengthwise
           And cut into 1/4*inch
           Slices
      2 lg Celery ribs, diced
    1/2 lb Fresh mushrooms, halved (if
           Small) or quartered
      2 c  Dried lentils, picked over
           And rinsed
      6 c  Boiling water
  1 1/4 ts Dried rosemary leaves
      1 ts Dried thyme or marjoram
           Leaves
      2 lg Bay leaves
    1/4 ts Crushed red pepper flakes
      2 lg Red bell peppers, roasted,
           Seeded, and diced
    1/2    To 3/4 cup minced fresh
           Parsley
      2    To 3 teaspoons balsamic
           Vinegar
           Salt and freshly ground
           Pepper to taste
 
  Heat broth in pressure cooker over medium-high heat.  Add garlic, stirring
  continually, adding more water if necessary to keep from burning. After a
  minute or two, add leeks and continue cooking, still stirring for another
  minute.  Add the carrots, celery, mushrooms, lentils, boiling water,
  rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, and red pepper flakes.
  
  Lock lid in place.  Over high heat, bring to a high pressure.  Lower the
  heat just enough to maintain high pressure and cook for 7 minutes. Allow
  the pressure to come down naturally or use a quick-release method. Remove
  the lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess steam to escape. If
  the lentils are not quite tender, either return to high pressure for a few
  more minutes or replace (but do not lock) the lid and simmer until the
  lentils are done.
  
  Remove the bay leaves.  Stir in the roasted red bell peppers, parsley, just
  enough vinegar to bring up the flavors, and salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Serves 6-8

 Categories: Soups, Indian, Appetizers, Vegetarian
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      2 c  Masoor dal (red lentils)
           Water to cover
      2 ts Turmeric
      1 ts Salt
      4 tb Canola oil
      6 ea Cloves garlic
      4 ea Jalapeno peppers
      2 ts Garam masala
      2 tb Cumin seeds
    1/2 ts Salt
           Additional salt to taste
 
  Sort and wash the dal until the water runs clear.  Place the dal in a
  soup pot and add water to cover by about 2 inches.  Add the turmeric
  and 1 teaspoon of salt and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer
  for about 30 minutes, until the dal is soft and beginning to fall
  apart. Add more water if the dal is too thick.
  
  Heat the oil in a frying pan.  Mince the garlic, coarsely chop the
  jalapenos (remove the seeds if you don't want the dal to be very
  hot). Add the garlic and jalapenos to the oil, along with the cumin
  seeds, garam masala and salt.  Saute for a few minutes, until the
  garlic begins to brown.  Add this mixture to the dal.  Mix well (you
  may need to add a little dal to the frying pan and pour this back
  into the pot to get all the spices out of the pan).  Simmer for
  another 20 minutes or so to blend all the flavors well.  Adjust salt,
  if desired.
  
  Top with chopped cilantro for garnish if desired.  Serve hot, with
  bread as a light main course, or incorporate into a full Indian
  dinner.

  ~ start 3/4 cup brown rice cooking; alternatively reserve that much
  uncooked bulghur - start 1 cup lentils cooking - dice and brown 1 large
  onion in some huge amount of olive oil (I used less than the 6 Tbs called
  for, which cuts down on the taste) - after 30 minutes of the lentils
  cooking, toss in the rice (drained) or bulghur, the onion, 1 tsp cumin
  [I've used twice as much and added some coriander as well], and some pepper
  and salt. simmer another 15 minutes - brown (caramellize) another diced
  onion - add the onion to the top of the lentil/grain mixture; let sit 10
  minutes
  
  The dish has a good consistency. I've made this twice in the past week from

      1    Potato, cut into chunks

  Heat up the margarine in a deep saucepan.  Fry the onion, carrot and potato
  until soft.  Stir in the flour.  Add the lentils and enough water to
  generously cover the lentils. Cook the lentils until tender, adding enough
  water as needed to keep the stew thick. (The lentils will grow and absorb
  water.)  While it is cooking, add thyme, salt, and pepper to taste. (Thyme
  should be the dominant spice.) Serve over rice (I cook S. Indian fluffy
  rice for this.)

      Title: STUFFED MONSTER ZUCCHINI
 Categories: Vegetables, August
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Giant zucchini
        x  Rice
        x  Lentils
        x  Celery
        x  Onion
        x  Garlic
        x  Cumin
        x  Thyme
 
  This is of general interest, so I'll post it.  I, too, was recently given a
  giant zucchini, big enough to effectively bludgeon someone. (ironically
  enough, I got it in a butcher shop my dad dragged me in to.) I sliced it in
  half horizontally, scooped out the seeds, and stuffed it with cooked rice
  and lentils and baked it.  Put some lentils in a pot with water and boil
  them until barely soft.  Throw in some rice and cook until barely done,
  using as little water as possible. Meanwhile, sautee some celery, onion and
  garlic (not too much garlic.) and add that to the rice and lentils, along
  with some ground cumin and thyme. Throw it on the zucchini and bake at
  around 350 or 400 until the zucchini is soft. The surface of the stuffing
  will probably get burned and dried out, but you van just brush it aside.

      Title: VEGGIE BURGER MIX
 Categories: Vegetables, August
      Yield: 12 servings
 
    1/2 c  Dry garbanzo beans
    1/2 c  Dry soybeans
    1/2 c  Dry lentils
    1/2 c  Yellow split peas
    1/2 c  Instant brown rice
    1/2 c  Rolled oats
      1 pk Dry soup mix or
           Salad dressing mix
    1/4 c  Bread crumbs
    1/4 c  Cornmeal
  1 1/2 ts Baking soda
 
  Put the ingredients one by one in a blender.  Turn on the blender.  Run for
  cover (it's pretty noisy).  When everything is reduced to powder, combine i
  a container.  To use, mix 1 cup of the mix with 2/3 cup HOT water or
  combination of water and BBQ sauce, water and wine, or whatever other liqui
  you can think of. Let sit 15 minutes, then form into 3 patties. Cook in a
  pan coated with nonstick spray. NOTE: If you use BBQ sauce as part of the
  liquid, they wi brown much faster - must be the sugar in the sauce. This
  recipe makes 4 cu of dry mix.
  
   The variations for this are endless, as you can use different dry mixes.
  Good Seasons makes fat free dry salad dressing mixes, and there are lots of
  different flavors of soup mix (I think onion soup would be good).  You coul
  also use the dry seasoning mixes, like the taco seasoning, etc. Some of the
  are fairly high in sodium, but I would think that in a quantity of mix, it
  would average out to an acceptable level.

 Categories: Vegetables, Sept.
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 c  Barley
    1/2 c  Mixed baby lima beans, split
           Peas, brown lentils
      1 T  Olive oil
      6 c  Water
      2 T  Miso
      1 lg Onion, chopped
      5    To 6 turnips, peeled and
           Cubed (or 2 parsnips, or 2
           Potatoes)
      2    Carrots, sliced about 1/2"
           Thick
    1/2    To 3/4 pound mushrooms,
           Sliced
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
    1/2 t  Pepper (or to taste)
      2 t  Marjoram
      1 t  Rosemary
    1/3 c  Tamari
      3 T  Unsalted butter (or magarine
           For vegan)
 
  Saute the garlic and onion in olive oil on medium heat until the onions are
  translucent. Combine the barley, lima beans, split peas, lentils, miso, and
  water with the onion/garlic, and bring to a boil. Add the turnips and
  carrots, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for about 1 1/2 hours,
  stirring occasionally.
  
  ("But grandma, where did they get miso in the Ukraine?" "Shut up and eat
  your soup.")
  
  (If you have broccoli stems, peel and slice them and add them at this
  point.  I also snagged about 1 cup of shredded/sliced cabbage from the main
  dish, and added about 1/2 hour before the soup was done).
  
  Add the mushrooms, spices and tamari and continue cooking on a low heat for
  another hour.  Add the butter or margarine, let sit for a few minutes, and
  serve.  If cooking the night before, you might want to add 1 cup of water
  and heat again just before serving; the barley tends to absorb water, and
  if you omit this extra water you end up with a tasty gruel.
  
  The butter can be omitted, but it makes for a heartier soup.

      Title: "TRICK" KIBBEH
 Categories: Soups, Syrian, Lebanese
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 c  Bulgur, fine grade, soaked
           -1/2 hour in enough water
           -to cover
    1/4 c  Flour
      3 tb Salt
    1/4 t  Cinnamon
      1 c  Thinly sliced green onions
    1/4 c  Finely chopped mint
    1/4 c  Finely chopped parsley
      9 c  Chicken stock
      1 c  Lentils
           Juice of 3 lemons
      4    Garlic cloves, crushed
    1/2 c  Olive oil
      1    Lemon
 
  The "trick" in this Syrian-Lebanese vegetable soup is that there's no
  meat in the kibbeh "meatballs." The idea that a vegetarian dish is a
  deception (vegetarian dolmas are known as yalanji, the Turkish word
  for "counterfeit") goes back at least 1,200 years in the Near East.
  
  In bowl, mix bulgur, flour, 1/2 tablespoon salt, cinnamon, green
  onions, mint and parsley. Add enough water to make thick dough. Rolls
  into 24 very firmly packed balls the size of large marbles. Set aside
  to dry.
  
  Put 9 cups chicken stock in pot, add lentils and bring to boil 10
  minutes. Add 2 1/2 tablespoons, reduce heat and simmer until lentils
  are tender, 20-25 minutes.
  
  Add bulgur balls and boil 5 minutes. Add lemon juice, garlic and oil.
  Simmer until balls are done, 10 minutes. Garnish with thin lemon
  slices.

      4    To 5 Potatoes
      1    Onion, chopped.
      2 c  Lentils
    1/2 c  Or more tvp
      2    Or more cups frozen veggies
           {I use peas, corn, carrots,
           Beans}
      1 c  Nutritional yeast {I use
           Enjivata yeast as well}
      1 tb {or more} tamari sauce
    1/8 c  Oil*
    1/8    Water
      2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Flour
 
  TO PREPARE: Top layer: Boil spuds & mash** {with soymilk, nutritional
  yeast, parsley, minced garlic}. Set aside.
  
  Bottom layer: Cook up 2 cups of lentils in vegetable stock and chopped
  onion. When through add enough textured vegetable protein to absorb the
  excess water. Set aside.
  
  Prepare nutritional yeast gravy: Toast flour over medium heat, add yeast,
  then oil and mix well. Add water. Bring to a boil and use whisk to get rid
  of clumps. May want to add more yeast. Add tamari and gravy flavoring. Cook
  a few minutes until thickened.
  
  Add to lentil and tvp mixture reserving about 1/2 cup for the top.
  
  In a baking dish {I spray with pam}, spoon in lentil-tvp-gravy mixture,
  then put on frozen veggies, then spoon mashed potatoes over everything.
  Drizzle with remaining gravy and bake for about a 1/2 hour or more in a 375
  degree oven.

      Title: LENTILS OLE <T>
 Categories: Digest, Feb95
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 c  Lentils
      3 c  Water
    1/2 c  Chopped scallions (green &
           White parts), or onion
           (either is good)
    1/2 c  Green peppers, diced
    1/2 c  Red peppers, diced
      1 tb Chili powder (adjust to
           Taste, esp. if you use spicy
           Chili powder)
    1/2 ts Cumin seeds, crushed (what I
           Use) or 1 tsp ground cumin
      4    Cloves minced garlic
      1    To 2 TBSP red wine vinegar
      1    8 oz can tomato sauce
      1 tb Molasses
 
  Bring the lentils and water to a boil, then cover & simmer for about 25 -
  30 minutes until soft but not mushy. While the lentils cook, saute the
  scallions, pepppers, garlic, chili powder and cumin in 1 TBSP vinegar til
  the vegetables are limp (about 2 mins). (NB: I do use a nonstick pan for
  this step.) Add tomato sauce and molasses, cook for 1 minute (scrape the
  stuck pieces off the pan), taste and add more vinegar if needed (I usually
  add another TBSP). Add mixture to lentils and cook until heated through.
  
  Great over rice, or maybe as a burrito or taco filling (recommend using
  less than 3c. water then, since this comes out very sauce-y).

      Yield: 1 servings
 
      3 c  Water
      1 c  Lentils
      1    Onion, chopped (recipe
           Called for "small" onion, I
           Used a large one)
      1    Green pepper, chopped
      2 ts Garlic (I used fresh
           Oil-free garlic from a jar)
      1 ts Red pepper
      1 ts Black pepper
      1 ts Cumin
    1/2 c  Salsa
      1 ea Ff tortillas

-----------------------------OPTIONAL GARNISHES-----------------------------
      1 ea Chopped fresh tomatoes
      1 ea Salsa
 
  Put water and beans in saucepan on med high heat. Add all ingredients
  except salsa and tortillas. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionlly. Reduce
  heat and let cook til lentils are soft, about 45 minutes. (Keep stirring
  because the beans will stick to the bottom of the pot.) Once the beans are
  mushy, add salsa, stir well.
  
  Place in tortillas, garnish as desired, and enjoy.
  
  NOTE: I didn't soak the beans beforehand and haven't experienced any
  problems. Mary McD says, in this book, that you don't need to soak lentils.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 c  Basmati rice
      1 c  Red lentils
  1 1/2 c  Potatoes, cut up small
           (eighths, i.e.)
      2 ea Garlic cloves, chopped
      1 ds Olive oil
      1 lg Onion, cut up
      1 ts Ground cumin
      1 tb Sweet Hungarian paprika
    1/2 t  Curry
    1/8 t  Cayenne
    1/2 t  Chili powder
      1 ds Worcesteshire sauce
      1 T  Tamari
      1 T  Vinegar
      2 T  Honey
      2 c  Tomatoes, chopped
      1 cn Tomato paste (6 oz)
      1 c  Vegetable stock
      1 c  Green peas, fresh or frozen
           Salt & pepper
 
  Start rice cooking.
  Note: Spices are on the mild side.
  Rinse & cook lentils and potatotes (approx. 25-30 min.) When done, drain &
  set aside.  Use plenty of water to cook lentils.
  While lentils are cooking, toast garlic. (Pile garlic in corner of a
  heavy, non-stick pan. Put a few drops of olive or other good-flavored oil
  over it. Toss garlic in the oil until coated. Saute, keeping careful
  watch, until the garlic is toasted. Gives a wonderful flavor and aroma to
  the food and your kitchen!).
  Add onions to the toasted garlic and saute in stock or water until they
  are just translucent.  Add chopped tomatoes.
  Make 1 cup of stock in a 2 cup measuring cup. Add tomato paste to the
  stock. Mix well. Add spices, tamari, vinegar, honey, etc. to that mixture
  and blend. Spice measurements are approximate and on the mild side. Add
  liquid to sauted onions. Add stock or water as needed & continue simmering.
  When lentil-potato mixture is cooked, drain and mix it into the saute. Add
  green peas & cook another 5 minutes.  Add salt & pepper to taste.
  Optional: Add chick peas, Bragg's liquid (in lieu of salt if needed).

      Title: PILAF WITH SOUR CHERRIES AND LENTILS
 Categories: Grains, Middle east, Usenet
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2 c  Basmati rice (*)
      2    Onions, peeled
           -(thinly sliced)
    1/2 c  Red lentils (*)
      7 oz Sour cherries,
           -or more  (*)
      2 c  Chicken or meat
           -broth (*)
      4 T  Butter, unsalted,
           -or more
           Turmeric, cumin, salt
 
  In a 4-5 quart Dutch oven, melt most of the butter and slowly brown the
  onions.  Add the cleaned lentils and fry a bit; then the same for the
  cleaned rice. Stir constantly, browning the rice without letting it stick.
  
  Add the cherries and about 2 1/4 cups liquid made up of cherry liquid,
  stock and water. Add about 1/4 - 1 t turmeric and about 1/4 t ground cumin
  if desired; add necessary salt (depending on the saltiness of your broth).
  
  Bring to a boil, stir with a fork, cover tightly, and let cook over the
  very lowest heat for about 20 minutes. Fluff up the rice with a fork (never
  a spoon) and add the remaining butter to the bottom of the pot.
  
  Raise the heat slightly for 5-10 mins to form a crust on the bottom (with
  the right technique, this should be possible without this step...). Serve,
  making sure to include a bit of crust in each serving.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Pilaf with sour cherries and lentils -- This Pilaf with sour cherries
  and lentils is a Persian-style dish, although I cannot vouch for its
  authenticity. It is rich enough to eat for dinner by itself; as a side
  dish, it might be good with a spiced grilled chicken or a lamb stew. It is
  a composite of recipes from cookbooks and from a Iranian Jewish family I
  know.
  
  *  An excellent side dish is yoghurt, possibly flavored (like the Indian
  raita) with one or more of:  fresh chopped herbs (parsley, coriander,
  mint), some salt, some spice (paprika, black pepper, black onion seed, or
  coriander seed), olive oil and lemon juice. Even better than yoghurt as a
  base is strained yoghurt, also called Lebany Spread or Lebanee, available
  commercially in New England from Columbo or Eunuch (look in
  Armenian/Arab/Greek stores).
  
  *  Basmati or Patna rice is a particularly flavorful and long-grained rice
  from India or Pakistan.  Any Indian store and many "natural foods" stores
  carry it.  It is well worth the premium price (about $1.10 a pound);
  "Texmati" is apparently the same strain grown in Texas, but does not have
  anything like the same taste. Inspect and clean it before using, there are
  often unhusked grains and occasionally pebbles mixed in. Then rinse in two
  changes of water and drain thoroughly. If you cannot get Basmati, use a
  good-quality unconverted long-grain rice (Alma, Carolina, but NOT Uncle
  Ben's!).
  
  *  Red lentils are about half the diameter of ordinary brown lentils.  Do
  not substitute brown lentils, which will probably not cook fast enough. Red
  lentils are available in Indian, Middle Eastern and some "natural foods"
  stores.  They often contain largish pebbles, so inspect them carefully.
  Rinse to get rid of dust, and drain. Red lentils are also very good by
  themselves, simply boiled with a few spices and served with butter.
  
  *  Sour cherries (in the Middle East, v/w + i + s/sh + n + e/a/ino:  Greek
  Vissino, Slavic and Turkish Vishnea, Arabic Wishna) are available fresh for
  about one week a year.  Most sour cherries go into cherry syrups, pies and
  preserves.  Canned sour cherries are quite good.  You will usually find
  them in the home pie-making section of your market, near the canned
  blueberries and baker's supplies, or with the canned fruits. There are
  occasional stones. (That is, pits, not rocks!) Middle Eastern stores will
  often have sour cherry preserves, which are too sweet for this recipe.
  
  *  Almost any stock or broth will work in this recipe.  Chicken or lamb is
  most appropriate, in the latter case, used rather dilute.  This is one of
  the few recipes where you can actually get away with canned chicken broth,
  but watch the salt.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
  : Time:  30-40 minutes.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

  NOTES:
  
  *  A simple soup with lentils, tomatoes and hot pepper -- This is a spicy
  vegetarian lentil soup.  It makes a very good main course or side dish. You
  don't have to soak the lentils ahead of time!
  
  *  The spicing can be varied to taste.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy.
  : Time:  15 minutes dicing, 2 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  no need to measure.

  day, saute the onion and carrot in 1 tablespoon of the butter.
    Add cloves, parsley, drained lentils and pepper, and enough water to
  cover. Cook in a large pot until done - about 1 1/2 hours.
    While the lentils are still very hot stir in the remaining butter until
  it is melted. Serve with game, game birds and sausages.
