Chicken Tandoori #1 Of 2

bbq, chicken, low cal, indian

8  chicken legs with thighs  attached
1/3 cup lemon juice
2 1/2 teaspoon meat tenderizer  unseasoned; natural
      ----FOR LOVELY VERMILLION COLOR----
1 tablespoon red food coloring
2 tablespoon yellow food coloring
      ----FOR MARINADE----
1 cup yogurt; plain
2 large garlic cloves
1 tablespoon ginger root; fresh; chopped
1 teaspoon cumin seeds; roasted;ground*
1/2 teaspoon cardamom; ground
1/2 teaspoon red cayenne pepper
1  ghee or vegetable oil; for basting

*HOW TO ROAST CUMIN SEEDS: Take a small sauce pan or frying pan and
heat it until moderately hot. Put in the cumin seeds and shake pan
back and forth or stir until seeds turn from dark green to brown.
This happens very quickly. Remove seeds immediately. When cool, grind
to a powder. If this seems like a big hassle, just use powdered
cumin. Flavor of dish will be only slightly different from original.

**ABOUT GHEE: Ghee is clarified butter. I usually use a mixture of
half margarine and salad oil.

DIRECTIONS: 1. Remove skin from chicken legs. Prick the chicken all
over with fork or thin skewer. Make diagonal slashes, 1/2- inch deep,
1 inch apart on the meat. Mix food colors together, and using a
pastry brush, paint chicken. Coloring will stain fingers, so be
careful. Put the meat in a large bowl.

2. Add meat tenderizer and lemon juice to the chicken, and rub them
into the slashes and all over for 2 minutes. Cover and marinate for
1/2 hour.

3. Put all the ingredients of the marinade into the container of an
electric blender or good processor, and blend until reduced to a
smooth sauce. (Alternatively, garlic and ginger may be crushed to
paste and blended with the remaining ingredients.)

4. Pour this marinade over the chicken pieces and mix, turning and
tossing, to coat all the pieces well. Cover and marinate for 4 hours
at room temperature, or refrigerate overnight, turning several times.
(I refrigerated chicken) Chicken should not remain in the marinade
for more than 2 days, because the marinade contains a meat tenderizer
which, with prolonged marinating, alters the texture of the chicken
meat to very soft and doughy.

Grilled Salmon With Potato & Watercress Salad

fish, salads, grill, low fat

3 lb small red thin-skinned
1  potatoes
1 cup thinly sliced red onion
1 cup seasoned rice vinegar
1  about 1/2 pound watercress
1  rinsed and crisped
1  salmon fillet, about 2 lbs.
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon firmly packed brown sugar
2 cup alder or mesquite wood chips
1  soaked in water
1  salt

In a 5-to 6-quart pan, bring about 2 quarts water to a boil over high
heat; add potatoes.  Cover and simmer over low heat until potatoes
are tender when pierced, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and chill.

Soak the onions about 15 minutes in cold water to cover. Drain and mix
onions with rice vinegar.  Cut potatoes in quarters; add to onions.

Trim tender watercress sprigs from stems, then finely chop enough of
the course stems to make 1/2 cup (discard extras or save for other
uses). Mix chopped stems on a large oval platter with potato salad
alongside; cover and keep cool.

Rinse salmon and pat dry.  Place, skin side down, on a piece of heavy
foil. Cut foil to follow outlines of fish, leaving a 1-inch border.
Crimp edges of foil to fit up against edge of fish. Mix soy sauce
with brown sugar and brush onto the salmon fillet.

Lay fish on center of grill, not over coals or flame. Cover barbecue
(open vents for charcoal) and cook until fish is barely opaque in
thickest part (cut to test), 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer fish to
platter with salad. Add salt to taste.  Serve hot or cold.

Pork With Rhubarb Sauce

low cal, pork

3 lb pork loin center rib roast (8 ribs)
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper; coarsely ground
1/2 lb rhubarb, fresh; chopped (2 cups)
1/4 cup apple juice concentrate; thawed
2 tablespoon honey
1  nutmeg, ground
2 tablespoon ; water
1 teaspoon cornstarch

Have the butcher loosen the pork roast backbone, if possible, for
easier carving.  Rub the roast with salt and pepper. Place bone side
down in a small, shallow roasting pan. Insert a meat thermometer into
the thickest portion of the roast; make sure bulb doesn't touch bone,
fat, or the pan. Roast, uncovered, at 325 F. until the thermometer
reads 150 F., about 75 to 90 minutes.

For the sauce, in a medium saucepan stir together the rhubarb, apple
juice concentrate, honey, and nutmeg. Bring to a boil; reduce the
heat, cover, and simmer ten minutes or until the rhubarb is very
tender. Mix the water and cornstarch; stir into the rhubarb mixture.
Cook and stir until the sauce is thickened and bubbly. Continue
cooking for two minutes more.

When the meat thermometer registers 150 F., spoon some of the sauce
over the roast.  Continue roasting until the thermometer reads 170
F., about 30 to 45 minutes more. Spoon on additional sauce
occasionally. Let the roast stand 15 minutes before carving.  Heat
any remaining sauce and pass with the roast.

MICROWAVE DIRECTIONS: Prepare and roast the pork as directed. For the
sauce, in a 1 1/2-quart microwave casserole cook the rhubarb, apple
juice concentrate, honey and nutmeg, covered, on HIGH until the
rhubarb is very tender, about five to seven minutes.  Mix the water
and cornstarch; stir into the rhubarb mixture. Cook, uncovered, until
the sauce is thickened and bubbly, about one to two minutes, stirring
every 30 seconds. Continue cooking for one minute more. Spoon over
the roast as directed and pass the remainder with the roast.
