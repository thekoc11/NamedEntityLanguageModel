  on low heat.

  originated after the Civil War.  People didn't have enough for
  themselves to eat let alone feed their dogs, so when the old
  hounds started barking from hunger, they would throw pieces of
  fried corn bread to them, yelling, 'Shut up, dog!  Hush puppy!"

  starts to escape from under the cover, let cook for 15 minutes.
  Turn off the heat and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes more.
  From Alex Patout's "Cajun Home Cooking"  Published by Randon House

  to lay out the crabs and vegetables on a large table covered
  with lots of paper and have a feast."

      Title: Smothered Round Steak
 Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Meats
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Round steak                       1/2 c  Vegetable oil
      2 ts Salt                                3 ea Medium onions, chopped
    1/2 ts Ground black pepper                 2 ea Bell peppers, chopped
      1 ts Ground red pepper                   1 ea Celery rib, chopped
      1 ts Ground white pepper                 1 c  Beef stock or water
      1 x  All-purpose flour (dredging)   
 
  Alex Patout says, "Smothering is a multipurpose Cajun technique
  that works wonders with everything from game to snap beans.  It's
  similar to what the rest of the world knows as braising--the
  ingredients are briefly browned or sauteed, then cooked with a
  little liquid over a low heat for a long time."
  Season the roast with one half of the salt and peppers.  Dust with
  flour on all sides.  Heat the oil in a Dutch oven or other large
  heavy pot over medium-high heat, add the steak, and brown well
  on all sides.  Remove the meat and pour off all but 1 teaspoon
  of the oil.  Add half the onions, bell peppers, celery, and the
  other half of the seasonings, and the stock or water.  Stir well
  and reduce the heat to the lowest possible point.  Return the
  roast to the pot and cover with the remaining vegetables.  Cover
  and let cook until the meat is very tender, about 1 hour and 15
  minutes.
  Serve the meat in slices, with rice alongside and the gravy over
  all.
  When you try this recipe with other kinds of meat, be sure to
  adjust the cooking times accordingly--let tenderness be your guide.
  For extra flavorful roasts, try larding with slivers of garlic
  before smothering.
  Serves 4-6

      Title: Patout's Boiled Crawfish
 Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Fish
      Yield: 8 servings
 
--------------------------------FOR THE BOIL--------------------------------
     40 lb Live crawfish                     1/2 c  Ground black pepper
      1 c  Salt                                5 lb Small white onions
    1/2 c  Ground white pepper                12 ea Ears of corn, shucked
    1/2 c  Ground red pepper                   5 lb Small new potatoes

----------------------------------SPRINKLE----------------------------------
    1/2 c  Ground white pepper               1/2 c  Ground black pepper
    1/2 c  Ground red pepper                   2 c  Salt
 
  Alex Patout describes Crawfish as "a delicacy made for sharing--
  in fact, in Cajun country, boiling crawfish for only two people
  counts as a venial sin."
  Wash the crawfish well and pick out any fish bones or other
  debris.  Fill a great big (40-quart) Stockpot a quarter full of
  water.  Add the salt and peppers and bring to boil.  Add the whole
  onions, the corn, and the new potatoes (it will be easy to remove
  them later if you put them in a cloth sack).  Return to boil, cover,
  lower heat to medium, and let cook for 8 minutes.  Add crawfish,
  cover again and raise heat to high.  After steam begins to escape
  from under the lid, cook 7 minutes more.  Remove from heat and
  let sit for 4 minutes.  Do *NOT* remove the lid until this point!
      Remove the onions, corn, and potatoes to a bowl and drain the
  crawfish.  Place the crawfish in a large insulated container (an
  ce chest works well, as do the thick waterproof boxes chickens
  are shipped in, which your butcher may give you for free).  Have
  your *SPRINKLE* ready and sprinkle over the crawfish and mix them
  well to coat.  Cover and let sit for 7 minutes.
      Serve immediately with the onions, corn, new potatoes, and
  lots of French bread on a large table covered with plenty of
  paper.  When everyone has eaten his fill, everyone "peels for
  the house."  The peeled tails can then be used in cold crawfish
  cocktail or salad or for Fried Crawfish the next day.
  Serves 8-10
  NOTE:  Most of the salt is not added until after the cooking
  process because too much salt added during cooking makes the
  flesh of the crawfish adhere to the shell.

      Title: Shrimp Creole
 Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Fish, Seafood
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Fresh shrimp, heads off           1/2 ts Ground black pepper
      1 qt Water                             1/2 ts Ground white pepper
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil                       1 tb Fresh thyme or 2 t dried
      3 ea Med. yellow onions, chopped         1 tb Fresh basil or 2 t dried
      2 ea Large bell peppers, chopped     1 1/2 ts Sugar
      5 ea Celery ribs, chopped fine           5 ea Bay leaves
     10 ea Lge. tomatoes, peeled&seeded        1 c  Green onions, chopped
      2 ts Salt                                1 c  Parsley, chopped
      1 ts Ground red pepper              
 
  Peel and devein the shrimp.  Place heads (if you have them), and
  peels in a small saucepan and add the water.  Bring to a slow boil
  over medium-high heat and let boil slowly for 15-20 minutes.  Strain
  and discard the heads and peels.
     Place the oil in a Dutch oven or other large, heavy pot and place
  over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, peppers, and celery and saute
  stirring often, until the vegetables are very soft, about 45 minutes.
  Stir in the tomatoes, salt, peppers, herbs, sugar, and shrimp stock
  and return to simmer.  Reduce heat to medium and let simmer for
  2 hours, stirring occasionally,  This is your creole sauce; it can
  be prepared 1 or 2 days in advance and stored in the refrigerator
  (I find the sauce is even better after sitting a couple of days in
  the refrigerator).
     When you are ready to serve, return the sauce to a simmer and
  add the shrimp.  Cook until they turn pink, 5-7 minutes.  Stir
  in the green onions and parsley and let cook for 1 minute more.
  Serve on flat plates over beds of rice.
     Serves 6-8.
  SHRIMP AND HAM OR TASSO JAMBALAYA:
  Prepare Shrimp Creole as above, but add about a pound of cubed ham
  and a 4-ounce can of tomatoe sauce to the finished sauce and simmer
  45 minutes more.  Meanwhile, boil or steam 2-3 cups raw rice.
  Finish the sauce (which will be your jambalaya base) by adding
  the shrimp, green onions, and parsley as above.  (If you are using
  leftover Shrimp Creole, remove the shrimp and reheat the sauce,
  add the ham and tomato sauce, and proceed as above.  Return the
  shrimp to the pan at the end of cooking.)  Place the hot, cooked
  rice in a large bowl, pour the jambalaya base over, mix well, and
  serve.
     You can also prepare this dish with sausage instead of ham.

      Title: Blackened Redfish
 Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Fish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6 ea 8-10oz redfish fillets            3/4 lb Unsalted butter, melted

-------------------------------SEASONING MIX-------------------------------
      1 tb Sweet paprika                     3/4 ts Ground white pepper
  2 1/2 ts Salt                              3/4 ts Ground black pepper
      1 ts Onion powder                      1/2 ts Dried thyme leaves
      1 ts Garlic powder                     1/2 ts Dried oregano leaves
      1 ts Ground cayenne pepper          
 
  NOTE: Fish fillets (preferably redfish, pompano or tilefish) cut
  about 1/2 inch thick.  Redfish and pompano are ideal for this
  method of cooking.  If tilefish is used, you may have to split
  the fillets in half horizontally to have proper thickness.  If
  you can't get any of these fish, salmon steaks or red snapper
  fillets can be substituted.  In any case, the fillets or steaks
  must not be more than 3/4 inch thick.
  Heat a large cast-iron skillet over very high heat until it is
  beyond the smoking stage and you see white ash in the skillet
  bottom (the skillet cannot be too hot for this dish), at least
  10 minutes.  (FT - this recipe is *NOT* for the faint of heart)
     Meanwhile, pour 2 Tablespoons melted butter in each of 6 small
  ramekins; set aside and keep warm.  Reserve the remaining butter
  in its skillet.  Heat the serving plates in a 250F oven.
     Thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl.
  Dip each fillet in the reserved melted butter so that both sides
  are well coated; then sprinkle seasoning mix generously and evenly
  on both sides of the fillets, patting by hand.  Place in the hot
  skillet and pour 1 teaspoon melted butter on top of each fillet
  (be careful, as the butter may flame up).  Cook, uncovered, over
  the same high heat until the underside looks charred, about
  2 minutes (the time will vary according to the fillet's thickness
  and the heat of the skillet).  Turn the fish over and again pour
  1 teaspoon butter on top; cook until fish is done, about 2 minutes
  more.  Repeat with remaining fillets.  Serve each fillet while
  piping hot.
     To serve, place one fillet and a ramekin of butter on each
  heated serving plate.
  I had this in K Pauls Restaurant in New Orleans.  It is a taste
  experience you will never forgive yourself for missing should you
  ever be lucky enough to find yourself in N'awlins and you don't
  go to K Paul's and order this.  Even people who don't like fish
  love this dish.

 Categories: Cajun, Appetizers, Poultry
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  2 1/2 lb Chicken wings                       6 oz Hot sauce or Tabasco
      1 x  Oil for frying (optional)         1/2 c  Melted butter
 
  Cut the chicken wings in two at the joints.  In a large frying
  pan or skillet; heat to 360F enough oil (or shortening) to
  cover the chicken wings.  Add the wings and fry until crisp,
  about 12-15 minutes.
     To bake, preheat the oven to 450F.  Spread the chicken wings
  out on a baking sheet in one layer and bake 45 minutes.
     To make the sauce, combine the Hot Sauce or Tabasco and melted
  butter and blend thoroughly.  As soon as the chicken wings are
  cooked, douse with the sauce, and serve immediately.
     Serves 2-6
  Nathalie Dupree's "New Southern Cooking"
  Nathalie says, "These little wings make a good meal for two or are
  a great appetizer.  Up North, they are called Buffalo wings and are
  served with celery and blue-cheese dressing.  The little wing tips
  should be trimmed off to make neater pieces.  But I cook them along
  with the wings and save them for myself.  I call them the "cook's
  treat."  You may fry or bake the wings, depending on dietary
  considerations.

    1/2 ts White pepper                      1/2 ts Dried thyme leaves

---------------------------PORK CHOP INGREDIENTS---------------------------
      6 ea 1-3/4" thick pork chops             1 cn (4 oz) diced green chilies
    3/4 lb Ground pork                         1 c  Pork or chicken stock
      1 c  Chopped onions                    1/2 c  Very fine bread crumbs
      1 c  Chopped green bell peppers        1/2 c  Finely chopped green onions
      2 ts Minced garlic                  
 
  In a food processor or blender, process the apples, 4 Tablespoons
  of the butter, the sugar, vanilla and nutmeg until smooth, about
  3 to 4 minutes.  Set aside.
    In a small bowl thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients;
  set aside.
    Prepare the pork chops by cutting a large pocket (to the bone)
  into the larger side of each chop to hold the stuffing.
    In a large skillet, brown the ground pork in the remaining 3 Tbsp.
  butter over high heat, about 3 minutes.  Add the onions, bell peppers,
  garlic, and 2 Tbsp. of the seasoning mix, stirring well; cook about
  5 minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping pan bottom well.  Stir
  in the green chilies and their juice and continue cooking until
  mixture is well browned, about 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally
  and scraping the pan bottom as needed.  Add the stock and cook 5
  minutes, stirring frequently.  Stir in the bread crumbs and cook
  about 2 minutes more, stirring constantly and scraping pan bottom
  as needed.  Remove from heat.
    Sprinkle the remaining seasoning mix evenly on both sides of the
  chops and inside the pockets, pressing it in by hand.  Prop chops
  with pocket side up in an ungreased 13x9-inch baking pan.  Spoon
  about 1/4 cup stuffing into each pocket; reserve the remaining
  stuffing.  Bake chops with pocket up at 400F until the meat is
  done, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Place the remaining stuffing in a
  small pan in the oven for the last 20 minutes to reheat.
    Serve immediately with each chop arranged on top of a portion
  of the remaining stuffing.

  1 1/2 ts White pepper                        1 ts Ground cayenne pepper
      1 ts Garlic powder                     1/2 ts Black pepper

------------------------------RICE INGREDIENTS------------------------------
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil                       4 tb Unsalted butter
      1 c  Chopped onions                  1 1/2 c  Uncooked rice (converted)
      1 c  Chopped green bell peppers          3 c  Pork, beef or chicken stock
    1/2 c  Pecan halves, dry roasted           2 c  Chopped unpeeled apples
    1/2 c  Raisins                        
 
  Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
     In a 2-quart saucepan, heat the oil over high heat until very hot,
  about 2 minutes.  Add the onions and bell peppers; saute about 2
  minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the pecans (we ran out of pecans,
  so Lucy substituted hickory nuts - good!) and continue cooking for
  about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the raisins and butter
  (these are added together so the raisins will absorb as much butter
  as possible).  Stir until butter is melted, then cook until raisins
  are plump, about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add the rice and
  seasoning mix and cook until rice starts looking frizzly (a bit like
  ce Krispies)  Chef Prudhomme recommended using converted rice.  Lucy
  used brown, long grain rice - super!.  This will require about 2 to
  3 minutes, stirring almost constantly before the rice looks "frizzly".
  Stir in the stock, scraping pan bottom well, then stir in the apples.
  Cover pan and bring to boil; lower heat and simmer covered for 5
  minutes.  Remove from heat and let sit, *COVERED*, until rice is
  tender and stock is absorbed, about 30 minutes.  (We cook the rice
  this slow way to let the flavors build to their maximum.)
    Serve immediately, allowing about 3/4 cup per person.

  1 1/4 ts Ground cayenne pepper             1/2 ts Dried sweet basil leaves
      1 ts White pepper                  

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
      1 lb Unsalted butter plus                2 tb Worcestershire sauce
      4 tb Unsalted butter                     1 tb Tabasco sauce + 1 teaspoon
      1 c  Onions, chopped very fine           2 cn Tomato sauce (16 oz)
      4 ea Med. garlic cloves, peeled          2 tb Sugar
      2 ts Minced garlic                       2 c  Green onions,chopped vy fine
  3 1/4 c  RICH chicken stock (see note  

---------------------------CHICKEN SEASONING MIX---------------------------
  1 1/2 tb Salt                                1 ts Black pepper
  1 1/2 ts White pepper                        1 ts Cumin (optional)
  1 1/2 ts Garlic powder                     1/2 ts Dried sweet basil leaves
  1 1/4 ts Ground cayenne pepper               2 lb Boneless chicken (see notes)
 
  NOTE:  To make a Rich Chicken Stock strain the basic stock, then continue
  simmering it until evaporation reduces the liquid by half.  For example,
  if the recipe calls for 1 cup Rich Stock, start it with at least 2 cups of
  strained basic stock.
  dark meat, cut into 1/2-inch cubes.
  Directions:
  Place in the hot water, oil and salt in a large pot over high heat; and
  cover and bring to a boil.  When water reaches a rolling boil, add small
  amounts of spaghetti at a time to the pot, breaking up oil patches as you
  drop the spaghetti in.  Return to boiling and cook to al dente stage, do
  not over cook.(To test doneness of spaghetti, cut a strand in half near
  the end of cooking time.  When done, there should be only a speck of white
  in the center, less than one-fourth the diameter of the strand.) Do not
  overcook.  During this cooking time, use a wooden or spaghetti spoon to
  lift spaghetti out of the water by spoonfuls and shake strands back into
  the boiling water.  (It may be an old wives' tale, but this procedure
  seems to enhance the spaghetti's texture.)  Then immediately drain
  spaghetti into a collander; stop cooking process by running cold water
  over strands.  (If you used dry spaghetti, first rinse with hot water to
  wash off starch.)  After the pasta has cooled thoroughly, about 2 to 3
  minutes, pour a liberal amount of vegetable oil in your hands and toss
  spaghetti.  Set aside still in the colander.
      Meanwhile, thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small
  bowl and set aside.
      In a 4-quart saucepan, combine 1-1/2 sticks of the butter, the onions
  and garlic cloves; saute over medium heat 5 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.  Add the minced garlic and seasoning mix; continue cooking
  over medium heat until onions are dark brown, but not burned, about 8 to
  10 minutes, stirring often.  Add 2-1/2 cups of the stock, the
  Worcestershire and Tabasco; bring to a fast simmer and cook about 8
  minutes, stirring often.  Stir in the tomato sauce and bring mixture to a
  boil.  Then stir in the sugar and 1 cup of the green onions; gently simmer
  uncovered about 40 nminutes, stirring occasionally.
      Heat the serving plates in a 250F oven.
      Combine the ingredients of the chicken seasoning mix in a small bowl;
  mix well.  Sprinkle over the chicken, rubbing it in with your hands.  In a
  large skillet melt 1-1/2 sticks of the butter over medium heat.  Add the
  remaining 1 cup green onions and saute over high heat about 3 minutes.
  Add the chicken and continue cooking 10  minutes, stirring frequently.
  When the tomato sauce has simmered about 40 minutes, stir in the chicken
  mixture and heat through.
      To finish the dish, for each serving melt 2 tablespoons butter in a
  large skillet over medium heat.  Add one-sixth of the cooked spaghetti (a
  bit less than a 2 cup measure); heat spaghetti 1 minute, stirring
  constantly.  Add 1-1/4 cups chicken and sauce and 2 tablespoons of
  remaining stock; heat throughly, stirring frequently.  Remove from heat.
  Roll spaghetti on a large fork and lift onto a heated serving plate.
  Repeat process for remaining servings.

   processor or blender and process until pecans and bacon are finely
   chopped, about 10 to 15 seconds.

      Title: Louisiana Roast Beef
 Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Meats
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/4 c  Onions, chopped very fine         3/4 ts Black pepper
    1/4 c  Celery, chopped very fine         3/4 ts Minced garlic
    1/4 c  Bell peppers, chopped fine        1/2 ts Dry mustard
      2 tb Unsalted butter                   1/2 ts Ground cayenne
      1 ts Salt                                4 lb Boneless sirloin roast
      1 ts White pepper                   
 
  In a small bowl combine the onions, celery, bell peppers, butter
  and seasonings, mix well.
  Place roast in a large roasing pan, fat side up.  With a large
  knife make 6 to 12 deep slits in the meat (to form pockets) down
  to a depth of about 1/2 inch from the bottom; do not cut all the
  way through.  Fill the pockets to their depths with the vegetable
  mixture, reserving about 1 tablespoon of the vegetables to rub
  over the top of the roast. Bake uncovered at 300F until a meat
  thermometer reads about 160F for medium doneness, about 3 hours.
  For rarer roast, cook until thermometer reads 140F. Serve immediately
  topped with some of the pan drippings if you like.

      Title: Cajun Prime Rib
 Categories: Cajun, Main dish, Meats
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 lb Prime rib roast (10-1/2 lbs)      1/4 c  Salt
    1/4 c  Black pepper                        2 ea Onions, thinly sliced
    1/4 c  Garlic powder                 

--------------------------SEASONING MIX (OPTIONAL--------------------------
      1 tb Plus 1 tsp, salt                    1 tb Plus 3/4 tsp, black pepper
      1 tb Plus 2 tsp, white pepper        2 1/2 ts Dry mustard
      1 tb Plus 2 tsp, fennel seeds        2 1/2 ts Ground cayenne pepper
 
  Remove fat cap off top of meat (butcher can do this for you) and
  save.  Place the roast, standing on the rib bones, in a very large
  roasting pan.  Then with a knife make several dozen punctures through
  the silver skin so seasoning can permeate meat.  Pour a very generous,
  even layer of black pepper over the top of the meat (the pepper should
  completely cover it); repeat with the garlic powder, then the salt,
  totally covering the preceding layer.  Carefully arrange the onions
  in an even layer on top so as not to knock off the seasoning.  Place
  the fat cap back on top.  Refrigerate 24 hours.
  Bake ribs in a 550F oven until the fat is dark brown and crispy on top,
  about 35 minutes.  Remove from oven and cool slightly.  Refrigerate
  until well chilled, about 3 hours.  (this is done so the juices will
  solidify and the steaks can be cooked rare.)  Remove fat cap and
  disgard.  With the blade of a large knife, scrape off the onions and
  as much of the seasonings as possible and discard.  Then with a long
  knife, slice between ribs into 6 steaks (4 will have bones); trim the
  cooked surface of meat from the 2 pieces that were on the outside of
  the roast.  Season and cook in your favorite way for steaks.
  TO BLACKEN THE STEAKS:  Combine the ingredients of the seasoning mix
  thoroughly in a small bowl; you will have about 8 tablespoons.
  Sprinkle the steaks generously and evenly on both sides with the mix.
  using about 4 teaspoons on each steak and pressing it in with your
  hands.
  Heat a cast iron skillet over very high heat until it is beyond the
  smoking stage and you see white ash on the skillet bottom--at least
  10 minutes.  (The skillet cannot be too hot for this method.)  Place
  one steak in the hot skillet (cook only one side at a time) and cook
  over a very high heat until the underside starts to develop a heavy,
  black crust, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Turn the steak over and cook until
  the underside is crusted like the first, about 2 to 3 minutes more.
  Repeat with the remaining steaks.  Serve each steak while piping hot.
  (*NOTE*:  If you don't have a commercial hood vent over your stove,
  this dish may smoke you out of the kitchen.  It's worth it!  But you
  can also cook it outdoors on a gas grill; a charcoal fire doesn't get
  hot enough to "blacken" the steak properly.  If you have a smoke
  detector in your house, you will be able to determine if it is working
  correctly.  This is NOT a dish to prepare in an apartment building
  with a central fire alarm system wired into your smoke detector.  It
  causes great excitement!  Also, you can be guaranteed you will meet
  your landlord.)

      Title: Blackened Redfish                       
 Categories: Fish, Cajun
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6 ea 8-10oz redfish fillets              1 ts Garlic powder
    3/4 lb Unsalted butter, melted             1 ts Ground cayenne pepper
      1 tb Sweet paprika                     3/4 ts Ground white pepper
  2 1/2 ts Salt                              3/4 ts Ground black pepper
      1 ts Onion powder                      1/2 ts Dried thyme leaves
 
  NOTE: Fish fillets (preferably redfish, pompano or tilefish) cut
  about 1/2 inch thick.  Redfish and pompano are ideal for this
  method of cooking.  If tilefish is used, you may have to split
  the fillets in half horizontally to have proper thickness.  If
  you can't get any of these fish, salmon steaks or red snapper
  fillets can be substituted.  In any case, the fillets or steaks
  must not be more than 3/4 inch thick.
  Heat a large cast-iron skillet over very high heat until it is
  beyond the smoking stage and you see white ash in the skillet
  bottom (the skillet cannot be too hot for this dish), at least
  10 minutes.  (FT - this recipe is *NOT* for the faint of heart)
     Meanwhile, pour 2 Tablespoons melted butter in each of 6 small
  ramekins; set aside and keep warm.  Reserve the remaining butter
  in its skillet.  Heat the serving plates in a 250F oven.
     Thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl.
  Dip each fillet in the reserved melted butter so that both sides
  are well coated; then sprinkle seasoning mix generously and evenly
  on both sides of the fillets, patting by hand.  Place in the hot
  skillet and pour 1 teaspoon melted butter on top of each fillet
  (be careful, as the butter may flame up).  Cook, uncovered, over
  the same high heat until the underside looks charred, about
  2 minutes (the time will vary according to the fillet's thickness
  and the heat of the skillet).  Turn the fish over and again pour
  1 teaspoon butter on top; cook until fish is done, about 2 minutes
  more.  Repeat with remaining fillets.  Serve each fillet while
  piping hot.
     To serve, place one fillet and a ramekin of butter on each
  heated serving plate.
  I had this in K Pauls Restaurant in New Orleans.  It is a taste
  experience you will never forgive yourself for missing should you
  ever be lucky enough to find yourself in N'awlins and you don't
  go to K Paul's and order this.  Even people who don't like fish
  love this dish.

      Title: Cajun Prime Rib                         
 Categories: Beef, Cajun
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      4 lb Prime rib roast (10-1/2 lbs)        1 tb Plus 1 tsp, salt
    1/4 c  Black pepper                        1 tb Plus 2 tsp, white pepper
    1/4 c  Garlic powder                       1 tb Plus 2 tsp, fennel seeds
    1/4 c  Salt                                1 tb Plus 3/4 tsp, black pepper
      2 ea Onions, thinly sliced           2 1/2 ts Dry mustard
 
  Remove fat cap off top of meat (butcher can do this for you) and
  save.  Place the roast, standing on the rib bones, in a very large
  roasting pan.  Then with a knife make several dozen punctures through
  the silver skin so seasoning can permeate meat.  Pour a very generous,
  even layer of black pepper over the top of the meat (the pepper should
  completely cover it); repeat with the garlic powder, then the salt,
  totally covering the preceding layer.  Carefully arrange the onions
  in an even layer on top so as not to knock off the seasoning.  Place
  the fat cap back on top.  Refrigerate 24 hours.
  Bake ribs in a 550F oven until the fat is dark brown and crispy on top,
  about 35 minutes.  Remove from oven and cool slightly.  Refrigerate
  until well chilled, about 3 hours.  (this is done so the juices will
  solidify and the steaks can be cooked rare.)  Remove fat cap and
  disgard.  With the blade of a large knife, scrape off the onions and
  as much of the seasonings as possible and discard.  Then with a long
  knife, slice between ribs into 6 steaks (4 will have bones); trim the
  cooked surface of meat from the 2 pieces that were on the outside of
  the roast.  Season and cook in your favorite way for steaks.
  TO BLACKEN THE STEAKS:  Combine the ingredients of the seasoning mix
  thoroughly in a small bowl; you will have about 8 tablespoons.
  Sprinkle the steaks generously and evenly on both sides with the mix.
  using about 4 teaspoons on each steak and pressing it in with your
  hands.
  Heat a cast iron skillet over very high heat until it is beyond the
  smoking stage and you see white ash on the skillet bottom--at least
  10 minutes.  (The skillet cannot be too hot for this method.)  Place
  one steak in the hot skillet (cook only one side at a time) and cook
  over a very high heat until the underside starts to develop a heavy,
  black crust, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Turn the steak over and cook until
  the underside is crusted like the first, about 2 to 3 minutes more.
  Repeat with the remaining steaks.  Serve each steak while piping hot.
  (*NOTE*:  If you don't have a commercial hood vent over your stove,
  this dish may smoke you out of the kitchen.  It's worth it!  But you
  can also cook it outdoors on a gas grill; a charcoal fire doesn't get
  hot enough to "blacken" the steak properly.  If you have a smoke
  detector in your house, you will be able to determine if it is working
  correctly.  This is NOT a dish to prepare in an apartment building
  with a central fire alarm system wired into your smoke detector.  It
  causes great excitement!  Also, you can be guaranteed you will meet
  your landlord.)

  NOTE:  To make a Rich Chicken Stock strain the basic stock, then continue

  if the recipe calls for 1 cup Rich Stock, start it with at least 2 cups of
  strained basic stock.
  dark meat, cut into 1/2-inch cubes.
  Directions:
  Place in the hot water, oil and salt in a large pot over high heat; and
  cover and bring to a boil.  When water reaches a rolling boil, add small
  amounts of spaghetti at a time to the pot, breaking up oil patches as you
  drop the spaghetti in.  Return to boiling and cook to al dente stage, do
  not over cook.(To test doneness of spaghetti, cut a strand in half near
  the end of cooking time.  When done, there should be only a speck of white
  in the center, less than one-fourth the diameter of the strand.) Do not
  overcook.  During this cooking time, use a wooden or spaghetti spoon to
  lift spaghetti out of the water by spoonfuls and shake strands back into
  the boiling water.  (It may be an old wives' tale, but this procedure
  seems to enhance the spaghetti's texture.)  Then immediately drain
  spaghetti into a collander; stop cooking process by running cold water
  over strands.  (If you used dry spaghetti, first rinse with hot water to
  wash off starch.)  After the pasta has cooled thoroughly, about 2 to 3
  minutes, pour a liberal amount of vegetable oil in your hands and toss
  spaghetti.  Set aside still in the colander.
      Meanwhile, thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small
  bowl and set aside.
      In a 4-quart saucepan, combine 1-1/2 sticks of the butter, the onions
  and garlic cloves; saute over medium heat 5 minutes, stirring
  occasionally.  Add the minced garlic and seasoning mix; continue cooking
  over medium heat until onions are dark brown, but not burned, about 8 to
  10 minutes, stirring often.  Add 2-1/2 cups of the stock, the
  Worcestershire and Tabasco; bring to a fast simmer and cook about 8
  minutes, stirring often.  Stir in the tomato sauce and bring mixture to a
  boil.  Then stir in the sugar and 1 cup of the green onions; gently simmer
  uncovered about 40 nminutes, stirring occasionally.
      Heat the serving plates in a 250F oven.
      Combine the ingredients of the chicken seasoning mix in a small bowl;
  mix well.  Sprinkle over the chicken, rubbing it in with your hands.  In a
  large skillet melt 1-1/2 sticks of the butter over medium heat.  Add the
  remaining 1 cup green onions and saute over high heat about 3 minutes.
  Add the chicken and continue cooking 10  minutes, stirring frequently.
  When the tomato sauce has simmered about 40 minutes, stir in the chicken
  mixture and heat through.
      To finish the dish, for each serving melt 2 tablespoons butter in a
  large skillet over medium heat.  Add one-sixth of the cooked spaghetti (a
  bit less than a 2 cup measure); heat spaghetti 1 minute, stirring
  constantly.  Add 1-1/4 cups chicken and sauce and 2 tablespoons of
  remaining stock; heat throughly, stirring frequently.  Remove from heat.
  Roll spaghetti on a large fork and lift onto a heated serving plate.
  Repeat process for remaining servings.

 Categories: Fish, Seafood
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Fresh shrimp, heads off             1 ts Ground red pepper
      1 ea Water                             1/2 ts Ground black pepper
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil                     1/2 ts Ground white pepper
      3 ea Med. yellow onions, chopp           1 tb Fresh thyme or 2 t dried
      2 ea Large bell peppers, chopped         1 tb Fresh basil or 2 t dried
      5 ea Celery ribs, chopped fine       1 1/2 ts Sugar
     10 ea Lge. tomatoes, peeled&seeded        5 ea Bay leaves
      2 ts Salt                                1 c  Green onions, chopped
 
  Peel and devein the shrimp.  Place heads (if you have them), and
  peels in a small saucepan and add the water.  Bring to a slow boil
  over medium-high heat and let boil slowly for 15-20 minutes.  Strain
  and discard the heads and peels.
     Place the oil in a Dutch oven or other large, heavy pot and place
  over medium-high heat.  Add the onions, peppers, and celery and saute
  stirring often, until the vegetables are very soft, about 45 minutes.
  Stir in the tomatoes, salt, peppers, herbs, sugar, and shrimp stock
  and return to simmer.  Reduce heat to medium and let simmer for
  2 hours, stirring occasionally,  This is your creole sauce; it can
  be prepared 1 or 2 days in advance and stored in the refrigerator
  (I find the sauce is even better after sitting a couple of days in
  the refrigerator).
     When you are ready to serve, return the sauce to a simmer and
  add the shrimp.  Cook until they turn pink, 5-7 minutes.  Stir
  in the green onions and parsley and let cook for 1 minute more.
  Serve on flat plates over beds of rice.
     Serves 6-8.
  SHRIMP AND HAM OR TASSO JAMBALAYA:
  Prepare Shrimp Creole as above, but add about a pound of cubed ham
  and a 4-ounce can of tomatoe sauce to the finished sauce and simmer
  45 minutes more.  Meanwhile, boil or steam 2-3 cups raw rice.
  Finish the sauce (which will be your jambalaya base) by adding
  the shrimp, green onions, and parsley as above.  (If you are using
  leftover Shrimp Creole, remove the shrimp and reheat the sauce,
  add the ham and tomato sauce, and proceed as above.  Return the
  shrimp to the pan at the end of cooking.)  Place the hot, cooked
  rice in a large bowl, pour the jambalaya base over, mix well, and
  serve.
     You can also prepare this dish with sausage instead of ham.

      Title: Smothered Round Steak                   
 Categories: Beef
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Round steak                         1 x  All-purpose flour (dredgi
      2 ts Salt                              1/2 c  Vegetable oil
    1/2 ts Ground black pepper                 3 ea Medium onions, chopped
      1 ts Ground red pepper                   2 ea Bell peppers, chopped
      1 ts Ground white pepper                 1 ea Celery rib, chopped
 
  Alex Patout says, "Smothering is a multipurpose Cajun technique
  that works wonders with everything from game to snap beans.  It's
  similar to what the rest of the world knows as braising--the
  ingredients are briefly browned or sauteed, then cooked with a
  little liquid over a low heat for a long time."
  Season the roast with one half of the salt and peppers.  Dust with
  flour on all sides.  Heat the oil in a Dutch oven or other large
  heavy pot over medium-high heat, add the steak, and brown well
  on all sides.  Remove the meat and pour off all but 1 teaspoon
  of the oil.  Add half the onions, bell peppers, celery, and the
  other half of the seasonings, and the stock or water.  Stir well
  and reduce the heat to the lowest possible point.  Return the
  roast to the pot and cover with the remaining vegetables.  Cover
  and let cook until the meat is very tender, about 1 hour and 15
  minutes.
  Serve the meat in slices, with rice alongside and the gravy over
  all.
  When you try this recipe with other kinds of meat, be sure to
  adjust the cooking times accordingly--let tenderness be your guide.
  For extra flavorful roasts, try larding with slivers of garlic
  before smothering.
  Serves 4-6

  In a 2-cup measure stir together egg yolks, light cream, sugar, and salt.
  Micro-cook, uncovered, on 50% power for 3 to 5 minutes or till mixture

  ~----
  Cool the custard mixture for Stirred Custard Sauce by placing the glass
  measure inside a larger bowl filled with ice water.  After stirring the
  mixture, stir in the Galliano, brandy or Amaretto and the vanilla.  Adding
  these ingredients at this stage speeds the cooling of the custard and
  helps prevent curdling.  Be sure to place clear plastic wrap directly on
  the surface of the custard befroe it is refrigerated.  Covering the
  surface will prevent a "skin" from forming on the top of the custard
  sauce.

      1 x  Dash Salt                      
 
  *    German cooking chocolate should be coarsely chopped.
  ~-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  In a small nonmetal bowl stir together light cream, chopped chocolate,
  sugar and salt.  Micro-cook, uncovered, on 100% power about 1 1/2 minutes
  or till chocolate is melted, stirring every 30 seconds.  Stir about HALF
  of the hot mixture into the beaten egg yolks.  Return all to the bowl,
  mixing well.  Micro-cook, uncovered, on 50% power for 2 to 3 minutes or
  till thickened, stirring every 30 seconds.  Stir in vanilla.  Pour into 2
  pot de creme cups or 6-ounce custard cups.  Cover and chill for several
  hours or till firm.  Garnish with whipped cream, if desired.
  NOTE:
  ~----
  SELECTING THE RIGHT CHOCOLATE:  You'll find three basic types of chocolate
  in the baking supplies department of most supermarkets--semisweet
  chocolate, unsweetened chocolate, and sweet chocolate.  The semisweet
  chocolate is made from chocolate that is just slightly sweetened with
  sugar.  Unsweetened chocolate is the original baking or cooking chocolate
  and has no added flavorings or sugar.  And sweet chocolate, such as the
  German cooking chocolate used in the Chocolate Pots de Creme recipe, is
  chocolate mixed with sugar and sometimes additional cocoa butter or
  flavorings.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 c  Active Sourdough Starter          1/2 ts Nutmeg
    1/2 c  Sugar                             1/4 ts Cinnamon
      2 tb Shortening                        1/2 ts Baking Soda
      2 c  Unbleached Flour                  1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Baking Powder                     1/3 c  Buttermilk or Sour Milk
      1 ea Large Egg                      
 
  Sift dry ingredients, stir into liquid, roll out and cut with regular
  donut cutter.  Then heat some oil in a deep fryer to 390 degrees F and fry.
  Makes about 17 Doughnuts with holes.  Just before serving dust with
  powdered or cinnamon sugar.
  NOTE:
  These doughnuts are virtually greasless.  And if you want you can make
  several batches at a time and freeze.  They keep well and to me taste
  after a while in the freezer.  Take out as many as needed and thaw and put
  sugar on or eat plain.

      Title: Homemade Pizza (Pinnacle) (2)
 Categories: Pizza, Cheese/eggs, Meats
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 x  RECIPES FOLLOW                 
 
  SEE HOMEMADE PIZZA (1)
  FLOUR THE SURFACE YOU WILL USE TO ROLL OUT THE DOUGH. YOU CAN NOT USE TOO
  MUCH FLOUR. USING A ROLLING PIN, ROLL DOUGH TO ABOUT 13 - 14" CIRCLE. IT
  MIGHT SEEM IMPOSSIBLE BUT CAN BE DONE. PLACE THE ROLLED OUT CRUST ON A
  GREASED PAN. USE YOUR FINGER TIPS TO PRESS THE DOUGH TO THE PAN. TRIM OFF
  EXCESS DOUGH FROM AROUND THE EDGES AND PUT IT WITH THE REMAINING DOUGH.
  THICK CRUST:
  START WITH A BALL OF DOUGH SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN A BASEBALL. PLACE THE
  DOUGH IN THE CENTER OF THE GREASED PIZZA PAN AND WITH YOUR HANDS, PUSH AND
  SPREAD THE DOUGH UNTIL IT COVERS THE ENTIRE PAN.
  DO NOT PUT THE TOPPINGS ON TO HEAVILY UNTIL YOU GET THE FEEL FOR FLAVOR.
  COOKING THE PIZZA:
  THE BEST TEMPERATURE TO COOK THE PIZZA AT IS AROUND 475 F. IT ONLY TAKES
  ABOUT 12 -14 MINUTES TO COOK A PIZZA SO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON YOUR
  MASTERPIECE.
  AFTER THE PIZZA HAS COOKED FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES YOU ARE READY TO TEST THE
  CRUST FOR DONENESS. DO THIS BY LIFTING THE EDGE WITH A SPATULA. IF THE
  PIZZA SLIDES IN THE PAN WHEN YOU SHAKE IT, YOU ARE READY FOR THE LAST
  STEP.
  REMOVE THE PIZZA FROM THE OVEN AND PLACE THINLY SLICED MOZZARELLA CHEESE
  ON TOP. SLIDE THE PIZZA OFF THE PAN ONTO THE OVEN RACK. COOK FOR ABOUT 5
  MINUTES. YOU NOW HAVE A PIZZA WITH A GOLDEN BROWN CRUST AND CRISP.
      ****************   TIPS FOR PIZZA MAKERS  *******************
  FOR THE DOUGH:
  1. USE A HEAVY GLASS BOWL RINSED WITH WARM WATER TO LET THE DOUGH RISE.
  2. YOU CAN USE THE DOUGH WITHOUT RISING IF YOU ARE IN A HURRY.
  3. TRY PUTTING SMALL AMOUNTS OF SPICE IN THE DOUGH WHILE MIXING IT UP.
  4. YOU CAN USE WHOLE WHEAT OR RYE FLOUR IN PLACE OF ALL PURPOSE FOR A
     DIFFERENT TASTE.
  5. YOU CAN ADD CHEESE TO THE FLOUR TO MAKE A TASTEY DOUGH.
  6. DON'T THROW OUT LEFT OVER DOUGH, IT WILL KEEP IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR
     MORE TWO WEEKS. MAKE SURE YOU STORE IT IN A LARGE BAG AS IT WILL RISE
     SOME. WHEN YOU ARE READY TO USE THE DOUGH LET IT WARM SOME FIRST.
  THE SAUCE:
  1. IF THE OIL RISES TO THE TOP WHILE COOKING, SIMPLY STIR IT BACK IN WHEN
     COOKING IS FINISHED.
  2. YOU CAN USE THE SAUCE WHILE IT IS STILL HOT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LET IT
     COOL FIRST.
  3. THE SAUCE CAN BE KEPT IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR UP TO ONE WEEK. TO KEEP
     IT LONGER, FREEZE IT!
  4. A MIXTURE OF 1 TABLESPOON FLOUR AND 14/ CUP WATER WILL SPEED UP
     THICKENING PROCESS.
  5. TO INCREASE THE YIELD OR CHANGE THE FLAVOR OF THE SAUCE, YOU CAN ADD
     ANY CANNED PIZZA SAUCE TO THE RECIPES ABOVE.
  6. USE CRUSHED SPICES IN ALL THE RECIPES RATHER THAN POWDERED.
  7. YOU GROUND, DRY ONION OR GARLIC INSTEAD OF FRESH. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS
  ON THE PACKAGE FOR AMOUNTS TO USE.
  THE FINAL:
  1. IF YOU USE SLICED MOZZARELLA CHEESE YOU WILL FIND THE SLICE THICKNESS
     VARIES GREATLY. YOU MAY NEED TO PLACE THE CHEESE ON BEFORE YOU SLIDE
     THE PIZZA OFF THE PAN, TO KEEP THE CRUST FROM BEING DONE BEFORE THE
     CHEESE MELTS.
  2. IF THE CRUST IS DONE AND THE CHEESE IS NOT MELTED, SLIDE THE PIZZA BACK
     ONTO THE PAN.
  3. IF THE PIZZA IS TO SOFT WHEN YOU SLIDE IT OFF THE PAN, YOU DID NOT USE
     ENOUGH FLOUR. USE MORE NEXT TIME.
  4. IF YOU HAVE ANY CHOPPED CHEESE LEFT OVER, FREEZE IT AS IT MOLDS FASTER
     AFTER BEING GRATED.
  5. USE LEFT OVER SAUCE IN ANY ITALIAN DISH CALLING FOR TOMATO TYPE SAUCE.
     OR YOU MAY SAVE IT IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR A GOOD MIDNIGHT PIZZA SNACK.
   *********************  FOR A FAST PIZZA  *****************************
  YOU CAN MAKE A FAST PIZZA BY USING TORTILLAS, EITHER CORN OR FLOUR.
  EVERYTHING ELSE REMAINS THE SAME. ALL INGREDIENTS GO ON TOGETHER ON A
  TORTILLA CRUST PIZZA AS THEY COOK VERY FAST. BE SURE TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE
  ON THEM WHILE COOKING. YOU STILL WANT TO SLIDE THE PIZZA'S OFF THE PAN
  BEFORE THEY ARE DONE TO CRISP UP THE CRUST.
  IT IS CERTAINLY HOPED THAT YOU WILL ENJOY THE RECIPES ABOVE AND HAVE FUN
  MAKING HOMEMADE PIZZA'S FOR YOUR FAMILY.

      2 tb water                               1 ts sugar

      1 tb oyster sauce                        2 tb oil

---------------------------------RICE DISH---------------------------------
      1 ea small yellow  onion               1/2 c  Red or green pepper, diced
  1 1/2 c  Celery, cut on the diagonal         3 c  Cooked, cooled rice
      1 c  Carrots, cut on the diagonal        1 c  Sugar snap peas or snow peas
      1 c  Cooked, cubed meat, any        
 
  * Rice should be preferably a day old. Remove stems from peas. Meat can be
    lean chicken, turkey or pork.
    Combine all the ingredients for the sauce in a 2-cup mixing bowl. Stir
    vigorously with a fork until the sugar has dissolved.  Place near the
    stove where it will be handy.
    Assemble the remaining ingredients near the stove in individual piles or
    dishes. Precook the carrots 1 minute in a microwave oven on high (100
    percent) power. The carrots also may be blanched in boiling water 2
    minutes to tenderize them.
    Place the oil in a wok or large skillet, Set over high heat and allow oil
    to become quite hot.  Add the onions first, stirring occasionally until
    they begin to caramelize and turn brown around the edges. Add the celery
    and stir 2 minutes longer. Add the carrots, meat and bell pepper and cook
    2 minutes longer, stirring constantly.
    Add the rice all at once, stirring quickly to mix all ingredients. (Some
    rice may begin to stick to the sides of the wok or skillet, but continue
    stirring.) Add the peas and pour in sauce mixture.  Stir until mixture is
    evenly colored with the sauce. Remove from heat and serve immediately.
    Test kitchen notes: The choice of ingredients is up to the cook. If
    desired, substitute bulb fennel or green onions for celery; peeled,
    deveined and cooked shrimp or lump crab meat for the meat; or English
    peas for snow peas. Remember to use low-fat ingredients to keep the
    calories from fat below 30 percent.
    Per serving, without meat: 419 calories, 12.8 grams fat, 61.8 grams
    carbohydrate, 715 milligrams sodium, no cholesterol. EACH SERVING = 27.4

      Title: Mock Apple Pie
 Categories: Pies, Fruits
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 ea pastry for a 9" crust pie           2 ts cream of tartar
     36 ea Ritz crackers                       2 tb lemon juice
      2 c  water                               1 ea Lemon rind grated
      1 c  sugar                               2 tb butter or margarine
      1 c  brown sugar                         1 ea Cinnamon to taste
 
  Preheat oven to 425F. Roll out half of the pastry and fit it into a 9-
  inch pan. Break the crackers coarsely into the pastry lined pan. Combine
  the water, sugars and cream of tartar in saucepan; boil gently for 15
  minutes. Add lemon juice and rind., and let cool. Pour the mixture over
  the crackers. Dot with butter and sprinkle with cinnamon. Roll out the
  remaining pastry and cover the cracker mixture. Trim and flute edges. Cut
  slits in top crust to let steam escape. Place in oven and bake for 30 - 35
  minutes or until crisp and golden. Serve warm or at room temperature.
  Makes 6 - 8 servings. Perhaps the most famous fake is mock apple pie,
  popularized by the makers of Ritz Crackers in the 1940's. The pie uses
  absolutely no apples. Instead of fruit, the filling is nothing more than 
  candied cracker crumbs with just enough lemon juice and cinnamon to hint 
  of Mom's real thing.

  the bowl.  Flour your hands and the work surface and kneed the ball of
  dough until it is no longer sticky.  Let the dough rise in an oiled bowl,
  sealed with plastic wrap, for 45 to 60 minutes in a warm place, until it
  is doubled in bulk. Punch it down and kneed it briefly. Press it into an
  oiled 15-inch deep dish pizza pan, until it comes 2 inches up the sides
  and is even on the bottom of the pan.  Let the dough rise 15-20 minutes
  before filling.  Preheat the oven to 500 degrees.  While the dough is
  rising, prepare the filling. Cook the crumbled sausage until it is no
  longer pink, and drain it of it's excess fat. Drain and chop the tomatoes.
  When the dough has finished its second rising, lay the cheese over the
  dough shell. Then distribute the sausage and garlic over the cheese.  Top
  with the tomatoes.  Sprinkle on the seasonings and Parmesan cheese.  Bake
  for 15 minutes at 500 degrees. Then lower the temperature to 400 degrees
  and bake for 25 to 35 minutes longer. Lift up a section of the crust from
  time to time with a spatula to check on its color. The crust will be
  golden brown when done.  Serve immediately.

      Title: Cider Marinated Beef Roast
 Categories: Beef, Main dish, Meats
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      4 lb Boneless rump, sirloin tip          1 ts Salt
      2 c  Apple cider                         1 ts Thyme
    2/3 c  Salad oil                           1 ts Mustard, dry
      1 tb Lemon juice                         1 ts Allspice
    1/2 c  Chopped onion                     1/2 ts Black pepper, fresh ground
      3    Cloves garlic, smashed              2 tb Cornstarch
      1    Bay leaf                       
 
  Here's  a boneless beef roast marinated in a flavorful apple-cider, onion-
  garlick mixture.  Surprisingly good.  The meat must be cooked to RARE or
  MEDIUM-RARE for its optimum tenderness, which may be bad news for those of
  you who like it well-done, but well-done, in this case, will prove to be
  tougher than the medium-rare.  The acidic action of the cider makes all
  the difference in  the world in terms of tenderness.   Combine that  with
  the marinating and the slow roasting, tenderness IS the name of the game.
  You can garnish this one with crab apples and parsley for making pretty.
  Directions for beef roast:
  Make a couple of dozen slits in the meat on the outside about an inch
  deep.  Place in a glass or plastic bowl. Combine the apple cider, oil,
  lemon juice, onion, garlick, bay leaf, salt, thyme, allspice, mustard and
  pepper; pour the marinade over the meat. Cover and marinate in the
  refrigerator at least four hours. Maybe more. Remove the roast from the
  marinade. Place on a roasting pan and insert the meat thermometer so it
  reaches the thickest part. Roast at 300 degrees until the thermometer
  reaches 140 degrees, about 2 hours for rare meat (meat continues to cook
  after it is out of the oven). Remove onto a warm platter.  Strain the
  marinade.   Skim the fat from the roasting pan, and add the marinade to
  the drippings.   Reserve 2 to 3 tbsp of the marinade liquid to mix with
  the cornstarch.   Stir the cornstarch into the boiling  liquid and cook
  until thickend.   Glaze the roast with the sauce.    Slice  *very thinly*
  to serve.  Especially  good served with potato casserole (or the new
  potato-garlick  recipe you just saw posted here), glazed carrots, green
  salad, garlick bread.

      Title: Smashed Radishes in Soy Dressing
 Categories: Vegetables, Salads, Dressings
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     24 ea fresh red radishes                  3 tb peanut oil
      2 ts salt                                1 ts sesame oil
      1 ts white vinegar                     1/4 ts fresh ginger juice
      1 ts sugar                               1 ea Chinese parsley for garnish
      3 ts thin soy sause                 
 
  Remove heads and tails from radishes; wash.  Using bottom of heavy
  drinking glass, about 2" across base, hit radishes on side to crack them -
  not mash them - so dressing can get into flesh.  Avoid rendering a
  crushing blow no matter how you feel that day.  Sprinkle radishes all over
  with salt, put them in a bowl, and set aside for about 15 minutes at room
  temperature.  Prepare dressing:  Combine vinegar, sugar, thin soy sauce,
  peanut oil, sesame oil and fresh ginger juice.  Double amount of vinegar
  for a sharper taste, if desired.  Drain liquid from radishes (salt will
  have drawn off quite a bit of water); pour dressing over them; cover and
  refrigerate for 30 minutes.  If you make this dish ahead of time, pour on
  dressing 30 minutes before serving.  Immediately before serving, transfer
  radishes to serving dish; garnish with Chinese parsley and serve.

      1 ea box fillo dough                
 
  Heat regular (salted) butter with honey until mixture bubbles.  Set aside
  about 1/8 of it.  In a bowl, combine nuts and nutmeg.  Pour remaining 7/8
  of honey syrup over nut mix to moisten.
  Lay fillo dough on cutting board lengthwise.  Brush one layer at a time
  with melted sweet butter (unsalted) until you have 3 layers.  Line up a
  1/4-inch wide strip of nut mix along edge of dough about 1/4-inch thick.
  Pick up that edge and roll dough into a cylinder with nut mix in the
  center.  Cut each cylinder into 8 pieces and place in 9 x 13-inch baking
  dish.  Repeat until all nut mix and fillo dough are used.
  Bake at 350 degrees until golden brown, about 10 to 20 minutes.  Warm
  leftover syrup and spoon on top.  Let cool before serving.
  If you cannot locate fillo dough, use our pie crust recipe, roll dough
  very thin, and use only one layer of dough instead of three.
  Makes 1 batch.

---------------------------------CHOCOLATE:---------------------------------
      6 oz semi-sweet chocolate                4 tb butter
 
  Use cream whipped stiff with sugar and vanilla, to taste.
  Such a gorgeous dessert - you say it "croak-em-boosh" - you'll need a
  pastry bag with a 1/4" tip to fill the tiny puffs with whipped cream.
  Preheat oven to 375.  Boil water and butter together.  Remove from heat, ad
  flour all at once beating rapidly till dough forms a ball.  (If it doesn't,
  put it back over medium heat and keep beating.)  Cool 7 minutes.  Add eggs,
  one at a time, beating frantically after each till dough is smooth.  Butter
  and flour cookie sheets and drop by small teaspoonfuls 2" apart and bake 16
  minutes until brown and puffed.  Put a little slit in each one, put them
  back in oven for 10 minutes more.  Cool completely.  Fill them from bottom
  with whipped cream.  Refrigerate till ready to assemble.  Make the caramel
  and pile puffs into a pyramid using caramel as glue - dip bottoms.  Make th
  chocolate and dribble it over all.
  CARAMEL FILLING:
  Bring to a simmer - swirl pan till sugar dissolves.  Cover, bring to boil,
  when bubbles are thick, uncover and swirl till light brown - remove from
  heat.
  CHOCOLATE TOPPING:
  Stir constantly over low heat till melted.  Sauce will harden as it cools.

    1/4 ts salt                                6 ea large eggs

-----------------------------------GLAZE:-----------------------------------
      1 ea egg beaten with 1 tsp water   

--------------------------MOCHA CREME PATISSIERE:--------------------------
      6 ea egg yolks                           3 tb unsalted butter
    1/2 c  sugar                               2 oz semisweet chocolate
    1/2 c  sifted all-purpose flour            2 ts instant expresso with 2 tsp
      2 c  milk                          

----------------------------------CARAMEL:----------------------------------
      2 c  sugar                               2 tb corn syrup
    2/3 c  water                          
 
  Preheat the oven to 425.  To make the puffs, melt the butter in the water
  with salt and sugar.  Remove from heat, add the flour, return to heat and
  beat vigorously for 2 to 3 minutes.  (A film should form on the bottom of
  the pan.)  Cool slightly, and add eggs, one at a time, beating vigorously.
  Using a pastry tube with a 1/2 inch opening, form 1-inch-high mounds, 3/4
  inch in diameter, on parchment-lined baking sheet.  Glaze and smooth the
  tops.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until puffed and golden.  Cool on racks.
  To make the mocha cream, beat the egg yolks, gradually adding the sugar,
  until mixture is thick and pale yellow.  Beat in the flour,  Scald the milk
  and add in dribbles, reserving 1/2 cup for thinning.  Return to clean pot
  and stir vigorously over high heat until mixture boils and thickens.  If it
  seems too thick to pipe, add reserved milk.  Remove from heat.
  Add the butter, 1 Tbsp at a time.  Melt the chocolate and add to mixture
  with the expresso.  Just before assembling croquembouche, inject the cream
  into the puffs with a 1/4-inch pastry tip.
  To make the caramel, bring sugar, water, and corn syrup to a boil over high
  heat.  Do not stir.  Cover pan until steam dissolves any crystals.  Uncover
  and boil 5 minutes, or until syrup is amber.  Remove from heat.  Dip the
  bottoms of the puffs, one by one, into the caramel and arrange in a pyramid
  Cut the tip from a balloon whisk, dip into caramel, and whirl strands of
  caramel around croquembouche to form a spun sugar web.

      Title: Croque-En-Bouche (3)
 Categories: Desserts, French
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      2 c  cold milk                           1 ds salt
    1/2 lb unsalted butter                 4 1/2 c  milk
      2 ts salt                                8 ea egg yolks
  1 1/2 tb sugar                               3 c  sugar
      3 c  flour                             2/3 c  flour
     12 ea eggs                                1 ea Caramelized almonds
      1 ea vanilla bean                        1 ea Caramelized orange slices
 
  From Paul Bocuse's French Cooking.  Pastry that crumbles in your mouth.
  Method:  Place milk, butter, salt, and sugar in a saucepan.  Bring to a
  boil, add the flour, dry the dough on the heat for about 4 minutes, beat in
  the eggs, one at a time.  Butter the pastry sheets, put the dough into a
  pastry bag, and pipe 60 small puffs onto the sheets.  Bake in a 400 degree
  oven for about 20 minutes.
  Cream Filling:  Steep a vanilla bean with a pinch of salt in 4 1/2 cups
  milk; in a bowl, mix the egg yolks with 1 1/2 cups sugar and then add the
  flour; stir into the milk with a whisk and cook over a low flame for a good
  5 minutes; use to fill the puffs.
  Heat 1 1/2 cups sugar until it melts and turns caramel color.  Oil the
  inside of a cone-shaped mold.  Dip the puffs into the caramel.  Starting
  from the point, stuff the whole mold with puffs, each one dipped into
  caramel.  Let cool.  Unmold.  Decorate with caramelized almonds and
  caramelized orange slices.

      Title: Croquembouche (4)
 Categories: Desserts, French
      Yield: 20 servings
 
---------------------------PUFFS (PATE A CHOUX):---------------------------
  1 1/2 ea sticks unsalted butter              1 ts sugar
  1 1/2 c  water                           1 1/2 c  flour
    1/4 ts salt                                6 ea large eggs

-----------------------------------GLAZE:-----------------------------------
      1 ea egg beaten with 1 tsp water         2 c  milk, scalded
      1 ea Pastry Cream (Creme Patissie        3 tb butter
      6 ea egg yolks                           1 ts vanilla
    1/2 c  sugar                               2 tb cognac
    1/2 c  sifted flour                        1 ea Pinch salt

----------------------------------NOUGAT:----------------------------------
      2 c  sugar                           1 1/2 c  toasted finely ground almond
      1 ea Juice of 1/2 lemon            

----------------------------------CARAMEL:----------------------------------
      2 c  sugar                               2 tb corn syrup
    2/3 c  water                          
 
  Use Pastry Cream (Creme Patissiere) for filling.
  Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  To make the puffs, melt the butter in the
  water with salt and sugar over low heat.  Remove from heat and beat in flou
  with a wooden spoon until completely mixed.  Return to heat and stir
  vigorously for 2 to 3 minutes.  Mixture will form a mass, and a film will
  form on bottom of pan.  Remove from heat and, one by one, add eggs, beating
  vigorously after each addition.
  Using a pastry tube with 1/2-inch opening, form puffs on a buttered baking
  sheet.  Glaze each puff with the beaten egg and water, using a pastry brush
  Smooth the top of each puff.  Put in the oven for 20 minutes.  Remove from
  oven and pierce each puff with a sharp knife.  (This allows the steam to
  escape so that the interior of the puff is not soggy.)  Return to the oven
  for 10 minutes more.  Cool puffs on a rack.  While cooling, prepare pastry
  cream.
  To make the cream, beat the egg yolks, gradually adding the sugar, until
  mixture is thick and pale yellow.  Beat in the flour.  Add the hot milk in
  dribbles, reserving 1/2 cup for thinning.  Return to pot in which milk was
  scalded, and stir mixture over high heat until it comes to a boil.  It will
  become lumpy first and then will smooth out with vigorous stirring.  Be
  careful not to scorch the bottom of the pot.  The cream should be thick, bu
  add milk if too thick to pipe.
  Add the butter, 1 Tbsp at a time.  Flavor with vanilla, cognac and salt.
  Cool completely.  Inject the pastry cream into the puffs with a
  1/4-inch pastry tip.
  To make nougat, melt the sugar with the lemon juice in a heavy pot.  Do not
  stir.  Boil together until a thick amber syrup is formed.  Stir in the
  almonds and spread the mixture on an oiled marble slab while warm.  Cut wit
  a sharp knife into a round for the base, and into small triangles for
  decoration.  Keep nougat warm in a 250 degree oven.  (It cannot be cut or
  shaped if it hardens.)
  To make the caramel, bring the ingredients to a boil over high heat.  Do no
  stir.  Cover pan (allowing steam to dissolve any crystals that might form).
  Uncover pan and boil several more minutes, until syrup is amber.  Reduce
  heat to keep syrup from hardening.
  Dip the filled cream puffs, one by one, into the caramel syrup and arrange
  on the nougat base, forming a cone resembling a pyramid.  The caramel holds
  the cream puffs together.  Note:  Assemble the croquembouche the day of the
  party, as it cannot be refrigerated.  However, the cream puffs, pastry
  cream, and nougat can be prepared in advance.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 ea HINTS AND TIPS                 
 
  Here are a few tips for baking your own crackers:
  1.  If you have cracker dough stored in the freezer, it's like money
    in the bank for spur-of-the-moment entertaining.
  2.  Baking sheets lined with parchment paper make easy work of
    cleanup.
  3.  Keep an eye on the oven because baking time may vary with each
    batch, depending on the heat and placement of the sheets.
  4.  Crackers store well in airtight containers, but last even better
    if frozen.
  5.  Homemade crackers usually are not as crispy as commercial
    varieties.  If they get a little limp hours or days after baking,
    revive them by heating in a 275 degree oven.
  6.  To reheat or crisp crackers, bake on ungreased cookie sheet at 350
    degrees for 3-4 minutes.

      Title: Honey Graham Crackers
 Categories: Crackers, Breads
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      2 c  unbleached flour                  1/2 ea stick butter, cut in 4 pcs
    1/3 c  whole wheat flour                 1/3 c  honey
    1/2 c  dark brown sugar, packed            1 ts vanilla extract
    3/4 ts baking soda                         5 tb water
    1/2 ts salt                           
 
  Use the metal blade of your food processor to combine the
  flours, brown sugar, soda, salt and butter, about 10 pulses.  Add the
  remaining ingredients, pulse 5 times, then process until the mixture
  forms a mass, about 20 seconds. Remove the dough, press it into a ball
  and divide it in half. Cover one half with plastic wrap.  Preheat the
  oven to 325 degrees.  Roll out the other half on a buttered rimless
  14x17 inch baking sheet.  Lightly flour the surface of the dough and
  roll until it is very thin and covers the baking sheet. Use the sharp
  side of a knife to cut the dough into 3 inch squares, then use the
  dull side of the knife to divide the squares in half. Prick evenly
  with a fork. Bake until evenly browned and firm to the touch, about
  12-15 minutes. Repeat with the remaining dough on a second baking
  sheet.  Follow the scored lines to cut the crackers apart while warm;
  they will crisp as they cool.  Gently lift them from the baking sheet
  with a spatula. Separate the crackers and store in airtight
  containers.  Makes about 50 crackers.

  (If the dough is slightly dry add another tablespoon of water.) Knead
  with hands into a ball.  Roll the dough between the palms of hands
  into a thick rope.  Wrap in waxed paper and chill for 15 minutes.
  After the dough has chilled, cut it into 12 equal pieces.  Working
  with one piece at a time (keep the remaining dough covered), shape
  into a ball.  Place the ball of dough between two pieces of lightly-
  floured waxed paper and roll out to a 4 to 5 inch circle.  Remove the
  waxed paper and place the circle on a large baking sheet.  Repeat with
  the rest of the dough.  The crackers can touch as they do not spread

  but not brown.  Cool on wire racks.  Store in an airtight container.
  These big, thin, golden wafers are streaked with vegetable pieces.

      Title: Muffies: They're the Tops
 Categories: Muffins, Breakfast
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 ea Muffie tip and hints           
 
  Who eats muffin bottoms? Just about everyone prefers the tops.
  Which is why I invented "muffies". They're baked on a baking sheet
  instead of a muffin tin and have no bottom.
  The muffie has a lot going for it: Two cups of muffin batter, which
  customarily makes 4-6 muffins, is enough for 16 muffins. And they
  take much less time to bake, usually less than 10 minutes. I prefer them
  just lightly browned so they stay a little moist and soft inside.
  Almost any thick muffin batter will work, but space the muffies at least
  two inches part because they spread a good deal, especially if the batter
  is not chilled. They way to get a puffier muffie is to refrigerate the batt
  until it is very chilled. Bake the batter right after it is mixed and all
  you'll get is a flat, soft cookie.
  Muffies should be enjoyed warm, right from the oven. To reheat, wrap
  them in foil and warm gently in a conventional oven. To store,
  arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze them. Once
  frozen, place them in an airtight plastic bag, then in another airtight
  plastic bag to stave off freezer odor. Defrost as needed.
  The following muffies will get you started. The first two are
  deliberately low in cholesterol. The Blueberry-Apple Muffie is not low,
  but not excessive, either.

  *** Notes included with the recipe:  "Root beer extracts, usually in
  an amount suitable for five gallons of beverage, are available from
  Hires, Schilling, and other herb and spice purveyors. These yield a
  drink that's very close in flavor to commercial root beers. Making
  your own infusions, however, allows for experimentation and a
  distinctive 'house' brew. Ours is less sweet than most."

     12 ea slices giant bamboo shoot           2 tb peanut oil

  soak them 30 minutes in cold salted water; rinse & drain.  Slowly heat
  deep-frying oil in wok to medium hot; test potato slice:  it should

  together when fried.  Arrange them in a cross-hatch pattern on Chinese
  wire strainer or other suitable strainer to form deep basket.  Press
  them in position with another strainer.  If you use bowl for pressing,
  heat it first, because you don't want to cool frying oil.  Immerse in
  oil & deep-fry until potatoes begin to brown.  Remove from oil; take
  away top strainer only; drain; reserve.
  When ready to serve, heat oil to very hot, but not smoking; deep-fry
  potatoes in strainer again until they are brown & crisp.  Place basket
  in nest of lettuce.

  seconds when scallops are warmed: don`t allow them to cook.
  Stir-frying:  As you heat wok to medium hot, stir-fry ginger slices &
  garlic to flavor wok; remove when they start to brown; discard.  When
  wok is hot, add peanut oil & salt; stir.  Add bamboo shoots & carrots;
  stir-fry 1 minute.  Add stock.  When stock boils, add scallops, snow
  peas, sugar, white pepper, gin & soy sauce.  Stir 1 minute.  Add

  stir to  breakdown egg and blend.  Add chicken and beancurd; mix
  thoroughly.  Dip cabbage leaves in boiling water to make limp.  Wash

  in shallow bowl.  Arrange carrots on leaves in decorative pattern.
  Pack chicken/beancurd mixture tightly in bowl to fill it.  Steam for
  about 40 minutes at medium boil.  Steaming will make mixture very
  smooth and firm (avoid over-steaming, which causes beancurd to become
  dry and hard).  When ready to serve, turn out on serving platter;
  gently remove leaves; cover with glaze.
  Glaze:  Heat stock in saucepan; when hot, add cornstarch paste to
  thicken.  When ready to use, reheat and add sesame oil; pour over

  CAREFUL!! With warm chicken to prevent food poisoning.
  Preparation:  Trim ends off green onions and cut light green and white
  part into 1" sections.  Mix all other sauce ingredients in 2-quart
  saucepan.  Reserve.
  Pull skin off breasts, then pull chicken meat from bones.  Slice meat
  into 1" strips, then crosswise to make 1" chunks.  In bowl large
  enough to hold chicken, add egg white to water chestnut flour.  Beat
  mixture with a single chopstick (not an egg beater or whisk).  Stir
  chicken pieces into egg mixture to coat thoroughly.  Marinate 5
  minutes.  Note: water chestnut flour gives a lighter crust than
  cornstarch, though the latter may be substituted.  Deep-frying:  Heat
  cooking oil in wok or deep-fryer to medium heat (you'll need more oil
  for deep-fryer).  Fry peanuts until they are a light tan color; if a
  test peanut browns quickly, turn down heat.  Remove peanuts with
  strainer or slotted spoon; drain on paper towel or paper bag.
  Reserve.  Turn up heat slightly for chicken.  Test a chunk first:
  chicken should raise to surface immediately & brown in about 2
  minutes.  Deep-fry coated chicken chunks until golden brown.  Deep-fry
  no more than 8 chunks at a time. Use long chopsticks or spatula to
  keep pieces separate while they are frying.  Remove with long
  chopsticks or slotted spoon. Reserve.
  Sauce:  While deep-frying chicken, heat sauce to simmer.  Add green
  onions & peanuts about a minute before serving.  At the last minute,
  add chicken pieces to sauce, mix quickly & serve.

      Yield: 8 servings
 
      2 c  of cooked rice                      1 ts sesame oil
      1 c  deep-frying oil                   1/4 ts salt
      1 c  dried soybeans                      1 ts sugar
      1 ea medium onion, quartered           1/4 ts MSG (opt)
     10 c  cold water                          1 ea clove garlic
      2 ts thin soy                           10 ea fresh snowpeas
      2 tb sherry                              1 ea large carrot
 
  Rice Cakes:  Work with cooked leftover rice that is slightly moist and
  sticky.  If too dry, reheat with sprinkling of water until sticky.
  Spread rice in frying pan or pie tin, 1/2" thick.  Pack rice into firm
  cake: this is important to make sure rice holds together.  Place in
  oven on low heat, and dry to slighly brittle texture; break into
  pieces.  Ten minutes before combining with soup, deep-fry rice pieces
  until lightly brown.  Strain, place in soup tureen, and keep hot in
  oven.  Avoid holding fried pieces more than 10 minutes, as they tend
  to acquire a rancid taste and become overly dry.
  Vegetarian Soup:  Wash, then soak soybeans overnight in enough water
  to cover.  In large soup pot, combine water, beans, onion and garlic.
  Bring to boil, lower heat, and simmer 2 hours.  Strain and reserve
  stock until ready to finish.  Save 1/2 of beans for soup.
  To finish soup, combine  strained stock, cooked soybeans, soy sauce,
  sherry, sesame oil, salt and sugar.  Peel carrot and make thin flower
  slices (or use flower cutter); add to soup.  Bring soup to just under
  the boil.  Add MSG and snowpeas.  Cook for 2 minutes.
  To serve, seat your diners, place soup tureen of freshly fried, hot
  rice pieces on table and pour hot soup over them.  If rice and soup
  are very hot, rice will sizzle and crackle to everyone's joy and
  amusement!

  tablespoon oil for each, in hot wok. Add salt to taste. Drain off

  ingredients, begin with hot wok, add 2-3 tablespoons oil, then add
  mushroom, fungus & lily flowers.  Stir-fry green onions, add all other
  ingredients to them, including noodles.  Allow dish to cool before
  serving.
  NOTE:  Fresh or canned bamboo shoot may be substituted for any
  vegetable.  Seaweed may be used instead of some of the fungus.

 Categories: Salsa
      Yield: 50 servings
 
      1 x  SEE DIRECTIONS FOR                  1 x  INGREDIENTS
 
      1 C  chopped green onions
    1/4 C  extra-virgin olive oil
    1/4 C  hot pepper sauce
    1/4 C  Cajun spice blend
    3/4 c  packed cup garlic cloves, peeled
     10 ea large just-ripe tomatoes
      3 lb large yellow onions, peeled

    1/4 C  extra-virgin olive oil
    1/4 C  hot pepper sauce (I use Melinda's Extra Hot)
    1/4 C  Cajun spice blend

  grinder. However, you can coarsely chop small batches with a food
  processor using on-off pulses.
  Preliminaries: Build a charcoal fire, then scatter presoaked mesquite
  chips over the coals. Using a mesh grilling rack, grill garlic cloves,
  turning often until golden brown. Remove from grill; reserve. Grill
  tomatoes, onions and chiles over glowing coals, turning frequently,
  until skin is charred. Remove from grill and leave skin on vegetables.
  Procedure: Core tomatoes; remove stems (not seeds or veins) from
  chiles. Cut tomatoes, onions, and chiles into chunks. Place in food
  processor or blender, then pulse on-off until mixture forms small,
  firm pieces.
  Thoroughly combine ground vegetables with remaining
  ingredients. Cover; chill at least 24 hours before serving. Yields
  about 8-10 cups.

      3 ea pasilla negro chiles              1/2 c  cider vinegar
      4 ea cascabel chiles                     1 ea clove garlic
    1/4 ts fresh ground black pepper      
 
  4 ea chipotle chiles, stemmed and quartered including seeds
  3 ea pasilla negro chiles, stemmed and quartered including seeds
  4 ea cascabel chiles, stemmed and broken, including seeds
  1/4 ts fresh ground black pepper
  3/4 c  water
  1/2 c  cider vinegar or Japanese rice vinegar
  1 ea clove garlic, smashed and quartered
  Place the chiles and their seeds in a small blender jar, add the garlic and
  the black pepper.  Mix the vinegar and the water together and heat until
  the mixture is just ready to boil, and add it to the peppers.  Tightly
  close the jar and let the ingredients steep for at least 1/2 an hour.  Then
  puree until smooth.
  This makes a tangy, tasty and thick salsa.  The rice vinegar makes a
  somewhat mellower salsa than the cider vinegar.  You could also use a
  distilled vinegar, or play around with the proportions of vinegar and water
  to achieve your own pucker level.

  1 Tb garlic powder
  3 Tb Balsamic vinegar
  3 Tb lime juice
  1 Tb dried cilantro
  Saute onion and garlic in olive oil over medium heat until tender.
  Add remaining ingredients except cilantro, stir then check for salt.  Add
  more if desired. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
  Remove cover and simmer an additional 30 minutes or until thickened.
  Remove from heat and add cilantro and stir. Chill salsa overnight before
  using.  Serve as a dip for chips or as a spicy topping on your favorite
  Mexican or Tex-Mex food.  Makes about a quart of salsa.
  Note: This makes a medium hot salsa. Your lips will tingle a little
  but it won't make your eyeballs bleed. Adjust the amount of ancho to
  the desired heat level or add another kind of hot pepper such as
  serrano or jalapeno to give it a heat boost.

  minutes before serving. Feel free to comsume the rest of the beer while
  waiting.  More sugar may be used if the tomatoes are acidic, but make sure
  the salsa does not taste of sugar.  I find 2 tsp. of salt too much for my
  tastes, I use 1 tsp. The salsa also works well without the beer.

      1 ea HINTS AND TIPS FOR CHILES      
 
  In these recipes, the chiles and tomatoes can be toasted by holding them
  over an open flame and charring the peel on all sides, or they can be
  roasted, by placing them under a broiler and turning occasionally until
  charred all over.  In either case, the peppers are wrapped in moist cloth
  or place in a wet bag for a while before peeling the skins off. The
  tomatoes can be peeled as soon as they are cool enough to handle. Salsa
  cruda means Raw Sauces. These are all uncooked and based on chiles and
  tomatoes.

  and render it down in a heavy casserole.  Peel onions and potatoes, scrape
  carrots.  Cut the meat into 8 pieces;  only excess fat is cut away.  Bones
  need not be removed.  Cut the carrots and onions in quarters.  Toss the
  meat in the hot fat until its color changes;  repeat with onions and
  carrots.  Add stock and season carefully.  Put whole potatoes on top.
  Simmer gently until the meat is cooked, approximately 2 hours.  Pour off

      Title: Dublin Coddle (Irish)
 Categories: Main dish, Meats, Irish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Bacon bits (pref. smoked)           3 ea Potatoes (or even four)
      1 lb Good meaty sausages                 1 x  Handful fresh parsley
      3 ea Large onions                        1 x  Grind fresh pepper
 
  Bacon bits are the off-cuts from the various types of bacon, which are
  sold very cheaply in Dublin pork butchers' shops, specifically for making
  coddle.  They contain a good mixture of fat, lean and skin.  I prefer to
  buy regular bacon with the rind on and cut it up into even-sized pieces.
  Leave on the rind, as it adds great richness to the soup.  Buy the finest
  quality pork sausages you can afford (or find).  Peel and chop the onions
  roughly.  Peel the potatoes as thinly as possible.  If they are large,
  then cut them into two or three large pieces;  otherwise leave them whole.
   Chop the fresh parsley. -- Place a layer of onions in the bottom of a
  heavy pot with a good close-fitting lid.  Layer all the other ingredients,
  giving each layer a grind or so of fresh-ground pepper.  Add no more than
  2 cups of water to the pot.  Bring the water to the boil, then reduce the
  heat at once, cover tightly, and barely simmer for 2 to 5 hours.  The
  perfect way to cook it is in a heavy casserole pot in a very low oven at
  250F.  I know this sounds vague, but if the pot is heavy and the lid
  tight, it really can't come to any harm.  The longer and slower the
  cooking, the better.  If you prefer, before serving, remove the sausages
  and quickly brown them on one side under the broiler.  Serve with white
  soda farl to mop up the soup, and bottles of stout.  It is a most
  restorative food.  -- From THE POOLBEG BOOK OF TRADITIONAL IRISH COOKING,

      Title: Cruibins (Grilled Pigs' Trotters, Irish Style)
 Categories: Meats, Irish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 ea Brined pigs' trotters               6 fl Wine vinegar
      2 x  Carrots                             1 x  Melted butter
      1 x  Stick celery                        1 x  Dried breadcrumbs
      1 x  Onion                               1 pn Allspice
 
  Get plain pig's trotters from your butcher and then brine them for 24
  hours. Once they've been brined long enough, bandage them with several
  strips of cheesecloth, or tie them several times around the short way with
  string, since they will try with all their might to fall apart into many
  pieces while cooking. Put into a pot with the vegetables, and cover with
  water and the vinegar. Simmer gently for 6 or 7 hours. Allow to cool in
  the liquid. -- To serve, split the trotter in two the long way and roll in
  melted butter and dried breadcrumbs mixed with a pinch of allspice. Heat
  slowly under a broiler, or in the oven at 350 F, until hot and crisp on
  the outside. Serve with mustard and horseradish for those who like such
  things....and LOTS of wet wipes and paper towels.
  .
  Basic brine for trotters:
  .
  12 1/2 cups water:  3/4 lb sea salt:  3/4 lb brown sugar:  2 oz saltpeter
  (optional):  1 t juniper berries:  small piece ungrated nutmeg:  1 bay
  leaf:  3 sprigs thyme:  1 t black peppercorns:  4 cloves.  Put all
  ingredients in a pan, bring to boiling point, skim and remove from the
  heat.  Let cool.  Add trotters, weight down with a very clean stone or
  other nonreactive weight, and leave for 24 hours.  (The spices are also
  optional if you're in too much of a hurry.)

      2 ts Baking powder                       6 oz Raisins, plain or golden
    1/2 ts Baking soda                         4 oz Butter
      1 ts Mixed spice *                       6 oz Golden syrup **
    1/2 ts Ground ginger                       1 x  Large egg, beaten
      4 oz Light brown sugar                   4 tb Milk
 
  *  Equal parts of cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice.  ** Lyons' Golden Syrup,
  carried in some fancy groceries.  If you can't find it, use Karo golden
  corn syrup.
  Sift the flour with the soda and baking powder, and the mixed spice and
  ginger:  then add the brown sugar, chopped peel and raisins:  mix.  Make a
  well in the center.  Melt the butter with the syrup over low heat, then
  pour into the well in the mixture.  Add the beaten egg and milk and mix
  very well.  Pour into a greased 2-lb loaf pan and bake in a preheated oven
  at 325 F for 40-50 minutes, or until it tests done.  This bread will keep
  moist for several days, and actually improves somewhat during this period.

      Title: Irish Soda Bread
 Categories: Breads, Irish
      Yield: 8 servings
 
  3 1/2 c  Flour                             1/2 ts Bicarbonate of soda
    1/2 ts Sugar                           1 1/4 c  Buttermilk:  to 2 1/2 c *
    1/2 ts Salt                           
 
  * You will need somewhere between these two amounts of buttermilk,
  depending on how much liquid your flour tends to absorb. Try to avoid
  using regular milk: if you must, use baking powder instead of bicarbonate
  of soda. -- Lightly grease a heavy skillet (if making "soda farl", the
  flat version of soda bread) or preheat the oven to 450 F (if making "soda
  cake", the round, more breadlike version.) Sift the dry ingredients
  together into a large bowl; make sure the soda is evenly distributed. Make
  a well in the center of the dry mixture and add about half the buttermilk.
  Stir until you have a raggy dough that is very squashy but which looks
  more or less dry. Add more liquid sparingly until you achieve this
  texture. Blend until all the flour has achieved this consistency; then
  turn out immediately onto a lightly floured board and knead ***for no more
  than a minute or a minute and a half***. Overkneading makes this bread
  very tough, and it's very easy to overdo it. If making soda cake, shape
  the dough into a circle about 8-9 inches across and about an inch and a
  half thick. Cut a cross about on the top, about half an inch deep, and
  place on a floured baking sheet. Bake at 450 F for 45-50 minutes. If
  making soda farl, shape the dough into a circle about 9 inches by one inch
  thick and cut into four wedges or "farls": place in the preheated skillet,
  with cut edges about half an inch apart. Cook slowly on the stovetop over
  low-to-medium heat: it should take about 20 minutes for the farls to puff
  up and turn a light brown on the pan side. Turn them and cook for another
  20 minutes. -- For a softer crust on either soda cake or soda farl, wrap
  in a dishtowel after baking. -- For more information on making sodabread
  and its variations, please see the file "SODABRED.TXT" included with this

      Title: Kerry Casserole (Irish)
 Categories: Main dish, Meats, Irish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    3/4 lb Belly of pork                       1 lb Onions
    3/4 lb Smoked bacon                      3/4 c  Stock
      2 lb Potatoes                            1 x  Salt and pepper
    1/4 lb Mushrooms                           2 oz Butter
      1 ts Rosemary                       
 
  (Irish pork belly has a fatty layer, vital for the flavor, and a meaty
  layer.  See if you can get your butcher to give you pork that has about
  equal amounts of pork and fat.  Plain lean pork will not taste as good.)
  Cut meat into one-inch cubes. Peel and thinly slice potatoes. Peel or wipe
  mushrooms, and slice if large.  Grease a large ovenproof dish with some of
  the butter, and place a layer of sliced potatoes in the bottom.  Add half
  the meat pieces, seasoned and sprinkled with rosemary.  Layer with half
  the vegetables, plus another layer of potatoes.  Repeat, using all meat,
  veg and potatoes.  Pour stock over and dot potatoes with remaining butter.
   Cover and cook in a moderate oven, 325F, for 2 1/4 hours.  Uncover for
  the last half hour of cooking to brown the potatoes.

      Title: Irish Stew (2) [Biddy Whyte Lennon]
 Categories: Meats, Main dish, Irish, Stew
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Stewing lamb or mutton              2 tb Chopped fresh thyme
      2 x  Large onions                        1 x  Water
      3 lb Potatoes                            1 x  Salt and fresh black pepper
      1 x  Large bunch fresh parsley      
 
  Peel the onions and slice them into rounds.  Peel the potatoes as thinly
  as possible.  Leave them whole unless they are very large.  Cut the meat
  into good-sized pieces.  Small chops can be left whole, larger ones
  divided in two.  Place a layer of onions on the bottom of a heavy
  casserole, and the meat on top of them.  Sprinkle chopped thyme and
  parsley generously, and season well.  Layer the rest of the onions with
  the potatoes.  Sprinkle thyme and parsley again at the last.  The amount
  of water you need to add depends on how good the seal is between your pot
  and its lid, and whether you like a "wet" or "dry" stew.  You will
  certainly not need more than two cups, and I use barely one.  Bring the
  water to a boil, cover as tightly as possible, and place in a preheated
  oven at 300F for 2 1/2 - 3 hours.  Keep an eye on it towards the end, and
  adjust the gravy by adding a little water if you think it too dry.  A good
  stew should have some gravy, but should not be flooded by it.  "Floury"
  potatoes will dissolve into the gravy, "waxy" ones will not.  I tend to
  use a mixture.  Serve very hot with more fresh chopped parsley sprinkled
  on top.  White soda bread to mop up the gravy.

      Title: Thackeray's Lobster (Irish)
 Categories: Irish, Fish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 ea Very large lobster                  1 tb Catsup
    1/2 lb Butter                              1 c  Vinegar (white wine if poss)
      1 tb Mustard                             1 x  Cayenne pepper to taste
 
  (Amounts are approximate:  the above measurement should be increased or
  decreased depending on the size of the lobster.  You want about a cup of
  sauce per two people.)  Thackeray's original follows:
  .
  "You take a lobster, about three feet long if possible, remove the shell,
  cut or break the flesh of the fish in pieces not too small.  Someone else
  meanwhile makes a mixture of mustard, vinegar, catsup and lots of cayenne
  pepper.  You produce a machine called a "despatcher" which has a spirit
  lamp underneath it that is usually illuminated with whiskey."  (He appears
  to be talking about a chafing dish with a pretty aggressive flame.)  "The
  lobster, the sauce, and near half-a-pound of butter are placed in the
  despatcher, which is immediately closed.  When boiling, the mixture is
  stirred up, the lobster being sure to heave about the pan in a convulsive
  manner, while it emits a remarkable rich and agreeable odour through the
  apartment.  A glass and a half of sherry is now thrown into the pan, and
  the contents served out hot, and eaten by the company.  Porter (i.e.
  stout) is commonly drunk, and whisly-punch afterwards, and the dish is fit
  for an emperor.
  .
  Unfortunately the day of inexpensive three-foot-long lobsters has passed,
  even in Ireland (lobsters of this size are still taken off the west coast,
  however).  In modern terms:  Clean and shell the lobster as indicated
  above.  Mix the mustard, vinegar, catsup and cayenne to taste (some people
  might prefer to cut the sourness of the vinegar by substituting a
  half-and-half mixture of vinegar and dry white wine).  Melt the butter in
  a large saucepan, saute the lobster briefly in it, not allowing it to
  color at all;  then add the mustard/vinegar/cayenne mixture, mix well,
  cover, and allow to stew over medium heat for 15-20 minutes.  Boiled new
  potatoes would go very well with this, or baked potatoes, or plain
  buttered rice.  Thackeray and his friends seem to have not eaten anything
  else with the dish, but they seem to have drunk a great deal;  he remarks
  in the next paragraph of the excerpt on ways to deal with the hangover....

  minutes.  Strain, reserving the liquid.  Heat 1 tablespoon of the butter
  and stir in the flour, cook for about a minute, stirring, then add the
  milk gradually, stirring all the time to avoid lumps.  Season with salt
  and pepper, add the sliced mushrooms and simmer for about 10 minutes
  longer;  then add the sherry or wine and finally the scallops.  When hot,
  transfer to an ovenproof dish and cover with mashed potatoes, making sure
  they cover the fish right to the edges.  Dot with the remaining butter and
  bake in a moderate oven, 350F, for 20-30 minutes, or until the top is
  turning brown.

  seasoning, then repeating the layers until the dish is full.  Add the
  stock, then dampen the edges of the dish before rolling out the pastry to
  the required size.  Place the pastry over the pie and press the edges down
  well.  Crimp them with a fork.  Make a small hole in the center.  Roll out
  the scraps of pastry and form a leaf or rosette for the top.  Place this
  very lightly over the small hole.  Brush the pastry with milk, and bake at
  moderate heat, 350F, for 25-30 minutes.  Cover the pastry with damp
  greaseproof paper when partially cooked if the top seems to be getting too
  brown.  Gently heat the cream.  When pie is cooked, remove from oven.
  Carefully lift off the rosette and pour the cream in through the hole.
  Put back the rosette and serve.  (This pie forms a delicious soft jelly
  when cold.)

      Yield: 20 servings
 
      1 c  Cold water                        1/2 ts Lite salt or less or none
      1 c  Cold skim milk                      2 c  Sifted flour
      6 ea Egg whites                          2 tb Canola oil
 
  Put liquids, egg whites and salt into a blender jar; add flour then oil.
  Blend at top speed, scrapimg any flour adhering to the sides of the jar.
  Cover, refrigerate 2 hours. This is an important step-it allows the flour
  particles to expand in the liquid and insures a tender, thin crepe. The
  batter should be a very light creamy texture-just thick enough to coat a
  wooden spoon. For each crepe, heat 6" nonstick fry pan over moderatly high
  heat. When hot, pour a scant 1/4 cup of the batter into the
  skillet;immediatly rotate the pan until batter covers bottom. Cook until
  light brown; turn and brown on the other side. Slide onto warm plate and
  proceed in same manner with rest of batter. Put waxed paper between
  crepes. Keep covered, as they cool, to prevent them from drying out. The
  crepes are now ready to be filled. Makes 20 crepes, 6" each.
  SERVING, STORING, FREEZING OF CREPES:
  These versatile crepes can be:
    Filled, folded or rolled and served immedately. Several recipes for
  fillings are in this DB.MM#s;46,
    Prepared ahead of time, piled up with layers of waxed paper between each
  one; wrapped in foil, refrigerated and reheated when ready to be filled
  and served.
    Prepared in advance, frozen and reheated at the last minute. Wrap in
  heavy foil to freeze. They will keep for weeks.
  CREPES-1001 WAYS TO SERVE AND ENJOY THEM:
  Crepes are thin relatives of the American pancake. They are easy to make,
  fun and can be eaten in a variety of ways.
    Festive and delicate desserts can be made using crepes, filling them
  with jams,jellies, puddings, or fresh or stewed fruit.
    Try a crepe cake! Layers of crepes are piled upon each other, each one
  spresd with a low-fat filling and served cut in pie shaped wedges.
  Appetizers, main dishes and desserts can be made that way.
    They can be served as a simple breakfast dish very much like pancakes.
    They become a nourishing main course when filled with a myriad of
  poultry, seafood or vegetable fillings-rolles into cylinders or floded and
  served with or without a sauce. They afford a marvelous opportunity for
  using leftovers in an elegant disguise.

  alternatly with yogurt to egg white mixture. Fold in fruit, and spread

      2 ea hot red chilies                     1 ea egg, beaten
      4 ea cloves garlic                       1 ea Garnish: lime wedges

      3 tb fish sauce (nam pla)              1/2 c  Unsalted peanuts, chopped
 
  Preliminaries: Soak noodles in warm water to cover for 30 minutes.
  Procedure: Trim any fat or sinew off the chicken and cut the breasts
  across the grain into 3-inch-by-1/4-inch strips. Shell and devein the
  shrimp. Seed and mince the chilies. Mince the garlic and ginger. Finely
  chop the onions, reserving the green part for garnish. Combine the fish
  sauce, vinegar and sugar in a small bowl.
  Cook the noodles in rapidly boiling water for 1 minute or until tender.
  Refresh under cold water, drain and blot dry on paper towels. Toss the
  noodles with 2 teaspoons vegetable oil.
  Heat a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat and add the rest of
  the vegetable oil. Fry the chilies for 30 seconds. Add the garlic, ginger
  and onions and stir-fry until tender. Do not let brown. Add the chicken
  and stir-fry until cooked. Stir in the shrimp and fish sauce mixture and
  cook until the shrimp turns pink.

  the egg starts to set, stir to scramble it and toss with the other
  ingredients. Stir in the noodles, bean sprouts and half the peanuts.
  Cook the pad thai just until the bean sprouts begin to wilt. (If the pan
  is too small, work in two batches.) Transfer the mixture to a platter and
  sprinkle with the remaining peanuts and onions. Garnish with lime
  wedges and mint leaves and serve.

      2 ea green onions                  

-----------------------------------SOUP:-----------------------------------
      8 oz rice sticks or cellophane no       12 ea basil leaves
      1 ea onion                               6 oz beef tenderloin or sirloin,

----------------------------------GARNISH:----------------------------------
      8 ea sprigs fresh mint or basil          2 c  Mung bean sprouts
      2 ea jalapenos thinly sliced             1 ea lime, quartered

----------------------------------EXTRA'S----------------------------------
      1 ea Hoisin sauce                        1 ea Asian chili sauce
 
  Use Rice sticks or cellophane noodles. Partially freeze beef before
  cutting.
  Cook's notes: Star anise, fish sauce, hoisin sauce and Asian chili sauce
  are available at Asian markets or some supermarkets with large Asian
  specialty sections. Use caution when working with fresh chilies. Upon
  completion of slicing, wash work surface and hands thoroughly; do not
  touch your eyes.
  Procedure: Combine the beef stock, ginger, star anise, green onions and
  fish sauce and gently simmer for 30 minutes. Remove the ginger, anise
  and green onions. Soak the rice sticks in warm water for 30 minutes.
  Slice the green onions, onion and basil leaves as thinly as possible.
  Slice the beef as thinly as possible across the grain. It helps to
  partially freeze the meat before slicing.  Bring 4 quarts water to a boil.
  Arrange the bean sprouts, mint sprigs, chilies and lime on a platter.
  Just before serving, bring the broth to a boil. Cook the rice sticks in
  boiling water for 30 seconds, then drain.
  Presentation: Divide the noodles among 4 large bowls. Arrange the
  scallions, onion slices and beef slices on top. Spoon the boiling broth on
  top: The heat of the liquid should be sufficient to cook the meat.
  Serve the soup at once, with the garnish platter on the side. Let each
  person add sprouts, mint, chilies, lime, hoisin sauce and/or chili sauce
  to taste.

      Title: Egg Noodles in Rich Hoisin Gravy
 Categories: Pasta, Main dish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 tb hoisin sauce                        2 tb cornstarch
      2 tb soy sauce                         1/4 ts chili oil or to taste
      1 tb Asian sesame oil, divided           1 lb fresh Chinese egg noodles
      2 tb peanut or vegetable oil             1 ds Salt
      2 ea large cloves garlic, minced         2 ea pickling cucumbers
      1 tb minced ginger                       3 c  Chicken broth or stock
      1 lb pork, boneless loin, minced     1 1/2 c  Beans sprouts, blanched
      1 tb Chinese rice wine              
 
  To prepare: pickling cucumbers, peel, seed, and cut into strips 1/8-inch
  wide and 2-inches long.
  Mix cornstarch with 4 tablespoons stock or water.
  Cook's notes: The Chinese would use egg noodles, but you can
  substitute readily available Japanese ramen noodles.
  Hoisin sauce, Asian sesame oil and chili oil are available at Asian
  markets or supermarkets with large Asian specialty sections.
  Procedure: In a bowl, whisk together the hoisin sauce, soy sauce, half
  the sesame oil and the chicken stock. Heat the peanut oil in a wok and
  stir-fry the garlic and ginger for 45 seconds, or until soft. Add the pork
  and stir-fry until nicely browned, about 2 minutes. Add the rice wine
  and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Stir in the broth mixture and bring to a
  boil.  Stir in the cornstarch mixture and return the entire mixture to a
  boil; it will thicken slightly. Add chili oil to taste and keep the gravy
  warm.
  Cook the noodles in boiling salted water about 1 minute, or until done
  to taste. Drain well and toss the noodles with the remaining sesame oil.
  Presentation: Divide the noodles among bowls, pour the gravy over
  them and garnish with bean sprouts and cucumber.

      Title: Spicy Somen with Steak Strips, Chilies and Mint
 Categories: Beef, Meats, Main dish

      8 oz boneless steak, trimmed             6 tb vegetable oil, divided use
      4 ea green onions                        2 ea serrano chilies, halved

      6 oz somen                             1/2 c  Beef broth
      1 tb Asian sesame oil                    1 c  Whole fresh mint leaves
 
  Note: Somen is thin white wheat noodles.
  Cook's notes: Use caution when working with fresh chilies. Upon
  completion of slicing, wash work surface and hands thoroughly; do not
  touch your eyes. Most supermarkets stock oyster sauce in their Asian
  specialty sections.
  Procedure: Cut the steak into 3-inch-by-1/4-inch strips.
  Cut dark-green part of the onions into 3-inch pieces and finely chop the
  remainder. Thinly slice the onion. Mince the garlic.
  Bring 4 quarts water and the salt to boil. Add the noodles and cook
  uncovered over high heat, stirring with chopsticks or a fork, for 1 1/2
  to 2 minutes or until the noodles are just tender. Refresh under cold
  water and drain. Transfer the noodles to a colander in a large bowl.
  Toss with sesame oil.
  Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-
  high heat. Add sliced onion and chilies and stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes,
  or until onion is lightly browned. Transfer to a bowl and reserve.
  Add 2 tablespoons oil to the wok and increase the heat to high. Stirfry
  the steak for 1 to 2 minutes, or until it just changes color. Transfer the
  steak to the bowl and reserve.
  Lower the heat to medium and add the remaining oil to the wok. Add
  garlic and green onions and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Add the noodles to
  the pan and heat thoroughly. Add the broth, soy sauce and oyster sauce
  and heat thoroughly. Add steak, onion slices, chilies, mint leaves and
  lime; stir-fry for 30 seconds.
  Presentation: Serve the spicy somen on heated plates. The chilies can
  be removed or left in for garnish. Warn your guests: They are
  extremely hot.

      Title: Blender Pesto
 Categories: Sauces, Pasta, Rice
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 c  Basil leaves, fresh packed          1 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Oil, olive                        1/2 c  Cheese, parmesan; grated
      2 tb Pine nuts                           2 tb Cheese, romano; grated
      2 ea Garlic cloves; peeled               3 tb Butter
 
  Put the basil, olive oil, pine nuts, garlic cloves and salt in the blender
  or food processor, (I use the food processor), and mix at high speed. Stop
  from time to time and scrape the ingredients down toward
  the bottom with a rubber spatula. When the ingredients are evenly blended,
  pour into a bowl and beat in the two grated cheeses by hand.  (This is not
  much work, and it results in a more interesting texture
  and better flavor than you get when you mix in the cheese in the blender.)
  When the cheese has been evenly incorporated into the other ingredients,
  beat in the butter (softened to room temperature). Before spooning the
  pesto over pasta, add to it a tablespoon or so of the hot water in which
  the pasta has been cooked.
  Katie's Note: Pesto freezes very well, so I make as much of it as I
  can when basil is in season. (Basil is also very easy to grow, and
  produces a lot). Spoon each serving (about 3 T) into small muffin tins and
  freeze. When frozen, pop out cubes and put in plastic bags. This way, if
  you are just cooking for yourself, or for more, it's always available. I
  try to have enough on hand in the freezer in September,
  so I can have it, one way or another, once a week or so until about
  the next July, when I can begin to harvest my next crop.

      Title: Para-Guacamole
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      3 ea california avocadoes                3 ea Juice of 2-3 lemons
      1 ea poblano chile                     1/4 ts powdered cumin
      2 ea serrano chiles                      1 ts Tabasco sauce
      1 ea small white onion                   1 ea Salt to taste
      3 ea cloves garlic                  
 
  Roast the poblano chile over a low flame (or under a broiler) until the
  skin begins to char and blister. Place in a paper bag and let set for a few
  minutes.  While the poblano is 'steaming', mince the onion and place in a
  large bowl.  De-seed  and  scoop  out  the  avocadoes,  taking  care to
  discard any brown portions Place the avocado in bowl with onion and pound
  into slightly lumby paste.  Take the poblano chile out of the bag and peel
  it, removing the stem, seeds, and internal membranes.  Remove the stem end
  of the serranos Peel the garlic cloves.  Place the poblano,serranos,
  garlic, lemon juice, cumin, and Tabasco sauce in a blender and whizz until
  pureed.  Add this  to the avocado/onion mixture in the large bowl and mix
  thoroughly.  The flavor blends better if the guacamole is left in the
  refrigerator for an hour or two before serving.
  There are at least as many variations of Guacamole as there are people who
  make it, but this version may offend some purists, hence the name.
  This recipe is the result of experimentation with the basic guacamole
  recipe.  I personally  prefer more  cumin in  it, but  you don't want the
  result to taste more like bean dip than guacamole.  Never use Florida
  avocadoes for guacamole -- you'll get a watery green pulp.

  in warm water for 30 minutes. Add milk mixture. Add all of white flour and
  half of whole wheat flour, about 3 cups. Stir until well mixed.  Gradually
  add the rest of the whole wheat flour. Stir at first, then mix with hands
  until dough pulls away from sides of bowl. Let rest for ten minutes. Turn
  dough out onto a lightly floured board. Knead, push and fold until dough
  is soft and springy to touch(about 10 minutes) and return to bowl. Cover
  the bowl, allowing room for the dough to double in bulk. Let rise in warm
  area(about 80-85 degrees) for 1 1/2 hours or until dough has doubled in
  size. Divide dough in half and let rest 10 minutes. Form into a oblong
  shape the length of the loaf pan, pinching the dough together tightly at
  the seams. Lightly oil two 9-by-5-inch loaf pans. Place dough seam side
  down, in the pans. Cover the pans to protect from draft and let the loaves
  rise once more until they have doubled in bulk. Preheat the oven to 350
  degrees toward the end of the rising period. When the bread has risen
  until it is just above the rim, it is ready for baking. Bake for 50
  minutes. When you remove it from the pan and tap it on the sides or
  bottom it should sound slightly hollow. The color should be  a rich golden
  brown. Makes two loaves(32 slices).

  The Cholesterol-Saturated Fat Index:
  "In order to make it easier for people to select foods that are low in
  BOTH cholesterol and saturated fats, we have devised a
  Cholesterol-Saturated FAt Index(CSI). The CSI enables you to grasp the
  contribution of both saturated fat AND cholesterol in one food compared to
  another. The CSI reflects our findings that the amount of saturated fat in
  the diet is just as important as the amount of cholesterol in terms of
  dietary control of the cholesterol and LDL in the blood.
      The lower the CSI number, the better the food choice for the
  prevention of heart disease(and the other disorders.....).

  I recomend very highly that you purchase and read the Connor's book.
  Besides the recipes which are included in this DB the book is filled with
  the latest research on degenerative diseases and diet.

  Dissolve yeast and sugar in 1/2 cup of warm water. Let stand 5-10 minutes.
  Place flours and lite salt in a large bowl, making a depression in the
  center. Combine milk, remaining water and dissolved yeast; pour into
  depression. Begin mixing flour with liquid, making sure all batter on
  sides of bowl is worked into dough. Knead until a smooth dough results and
  the sides of the bowl are clean. (Occasionally dip hands in more water
  while kneading to give a smooth, elastic finish.) Cover with towel and let
  dough rise in a warm place until it doubles in size (2-4 hours). Form into
  16 smooth balls. Cover and let rise on a cloth for 30 minutes.. Roll into
  1/4" thick circles. Cover and let rise again on cloth for 30 minutes.
  Prehrat oven to 475 degrees. Place dough directly on racks in oven. As
  soon as the dough rises into a mound, 2-5 minutes, place under broiler for
  a few seconds until lightly browned. Cool. Makes 16 pitas.

      2 c  Skim milk                         1/4 c  Canola oil
      2 ea Envelopes active dry yeast      6 3/4 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Very warm water                     1 qt Water
    1/2 c  Sugar                               1 ea Egg white
    3/4 ts Baking powder                       1 tb Water
      1 ts Lite salt or less              
 
  Scald milk-cool to lukewarm. In a large bowl, sprinkle yeast over 1/2 cup
  very warm water to dissolve. Add sugar, cooled milk, baking powder, lite
  salt and oil. Add 3 cups flour. Cover and let rise until double in
  size(about 45 minutes). Stir down batter, add remaining flour and knead
  for about 10 minutes on lightly floured board. Punch down dough. Cut into
  20 pieces and set aside 10 minutes. Roll each piece into thin, ropelike, 24
  inch length, using your hands to roll and stretch dough. Dough will be
  elastic and will retract somewhat after being stretcheed. To form a
  pretzel, grasp each end of dough, forming a horseshoe with curved part
  away from you. Twist ends once around each other and press each firmly onto
  loop of dough beneath them. Set dough aside to rest on a lightly floured
  work surface, covered, for 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Dust
  baking sheet with cornmeal. In a large, deep pan, simmer 1 quart water.
  Poach pretzels 2-3 at a time for about 30 seconds, removing gently with a
  slotted spoon. Carefully pat dry with paper towels, and put on prepared
  baking sheet. Mix egg white 1 tablespoon water. Brush each pretzel with
  egg white glaze. Bake until golden brown, 12-15 minutes. For crustier
  pretzels, put under broiler 30 seconds before baking. Serve warm with
  mustard. Makes 20 large pretzels.

      Title: Whole Wheat French Bread
 Categories: Breads, French
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 tb Active dry yeast                    3 c  White flour
      1 tb Sugar                               2 c  Whole wheat flour(or 3)
      1 ts Lite salt                           1 ea Egg white+1 T cold water
  2 1/2 c  Lukewarm water                 
 
  Combine yeast, sugar,lite salt and water in a large bowl. Gradually add
  the flours and mix well(hands work best). At first the dough will be very
  sticky; add enough flour to transfer it to a lightly floured board. Knead
  until the dough is no longer sticky(about 10 minutes), adding more flour
  as necessary. Place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with a damp cloth and
  let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume(1 1/2-2 hours). Punch
  dough down. Transfer to a floured board and cut into four equal parts.
  Roll and shape each part into a long loaf. Place loaves into a lightly
  oiled, special long-loaf pans(baguette pans). Slash the top of each loaf
  diagonally in three or four places and brush with egg white and water
  mixture. Let dough rise another hour or until doubled in volume. Preheat
  oven to 350 degrees. Bake the loaves until browned and hollow-sounding
  when thumped, about 25 minutes.*  Halfway through baking, it may be
  necessary to cover the loaves with foil to prevent scorching the tops. Let
  cool on rack. Makes 4 loaves, about 18 inches long.
  * If planning to freeze bread, underbake,i.e., bake in oven only 15
  minutes. Wrap in foil when cool.Freeze. When ready to serve remove from
  freezer. Leave wrapped in foil. Place in 350 degree oven for 10 minutes.
  Remove foil and continue to bake for 5  minutes, until crisp.

      Title: Perfect Buttermilk Biscuit
 Categories: Breads, Breakfast
      Yield: 12 servings
 
    1/2 c  shortening                          1 tb sugar
  2 1/4 c  flour                             1/2 ts salt
  2 1/2 ts baking powder                   1 1/4 c  buttermilk
    1/2 ts baking soda                    
 
  Place shortening in small plastic food bag. Flatten shortening
  between plastic sheets so it is thin and return to freezer. This
  allows shortening to become hard enough to break, into tiny pieces
  when added to dry ingredients.
  Tear 2 pieces wax paper about 15 inches long and place on counter,
  Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and salt onto wax
  paper. Place empty sifter on top of bare sheet of wax paper, lift
  sheet of wax paper holding sifted dry ingredients by sides and pour
  through sifter, sifting onto bare wax paper. Sift back and forth 3
  times, then sift once more into large mixing bowl.
  Remove shortening from freezer. Cut into small bits, about 1/4-inch
  square. Drop shortening bits into bowl of dry ingredients and,
  using fingertips, lightly rub shortening and flour together,
  occasionally tossing flour mixture so you touch all particles of
  shortening with flour. When mixture has bits of flour-covered
  shortening throughout, begin adding buttermilk. Using fork, add
  buttermilk, lightly stirring to mix with dry ingredients.
  Cover board or surface with dusting of flour. Gather sticky mass of
  dough and place on floured surface. Dust hands with flour and
  gently knead dough, adding enough flour only to make dough
  manageable. Pat dough with hands or roll with floured rolling pin
  into round 1/2-inch thick. Using 2-inch cutter, cut out biscuits and
  place touching each other in 3 rows, in center of greased baking
  sheet. Place on middle rack of 425-degree oven and bake 12 minutes,
  or until lightly golden. Remove from oven and serve hot or warm.
  Makes 19 (2-inch round) biscuits.
  ***NOTE::By Marion Cunningham
  Thanks to Eula Mae Dore, a great Southern cook from Avery
  Plantation, La., I've learned to make the best Buttermilk Biscuits
  I've ever had.
  Eula Mae says a good biscuit is one of the best things to have on
  hand for quick meals. She uses them in emergencies to make simple
  sandwiches filled with scraps of ham or cheese and serves them with
  pickles and a small salad. For dessert, she warms a biscuit or two
  and makes a shortcake with fresh fruits or berries. She has convinced
  me that you can't have too many biscuits on hand.
  Eula Mae learned to cook and bake from her grandmother, not from
  cookbooks, and the artfulness of her preparation was a joy to watch.
  Here are some of her biscuit-making tips:
  + First go out and replace your baking powder, unless you bought it
  within the last four months. More baking flops occur from old,
  tired baking powder than from any other cause. And don't rely on
  the old test of checking the freshness of baking powder by putting a
  spoonful in a glass of water to see if it fizzes. Baking powder, like
  a carbonated drink, can fizz a little and still be almost flat.
  Buying new baking powder costs very little when you consider the cost
  of baking failures.
  + Next, Eula Mae insists that sifting the dry ingredients four times
  is the reason her biscuits are perfect. I tested the recipe sifting
  and not sifting and, indeed, sifting does make a slightly higher,
  more tender biscuit.
  + After you cut the biscuit dough, put the pieces on a baking sheet
  upside down. This ensures a taller, lighter biscuit by making sure
  any edges crimped by the pressure of the cutting don't interfere
  with the rise. (The French use the same trick when making puff
  pastry.)
  + The tip that helped me the most was using less flour than usual.
  Eula Mae's dough was soft and sticky. She handled it gently, dusting
  her hands and the dough with only enough flour to make the
  dough manageable. The result was a lighter biscuit.

      Title: Bagels
 Categories: Breads, Breakfast
      Yield: 18 servings
 
  5 1/2 c  Flour, all purpose, approx.         2 c  Water, hot (120-130 deg)
      2 pk Yeast, dry                      3 1/2 qt Water with 1 Tbs. of malt sy
      1 tb Sugar                               1 ea Egg white, beaten, mixed wit
      1 tb Salt                                1 ea Toppings (onion, garlic, pop
      2 tb Malt syrup                     
 
  3 1/2 qt Water with 1 Tbs. of malt syrup in it :: 1 ea Egg white,
  beaten, mixed with 1 tsp. water :: 1 ea Toppings (onion, garlic,
  poppy or sesame seed...) MIXING, KNEADING, AND 1ST RISE: Mix all dry
  ingredients, including yeast, thoroughly.  Mix malt syrup and water.
  Make sure the temperature is between 120 and 130 degrees.  Add hot
  water mixture and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon or your hand.
  When is blended together, remove from bowl and knead (By hand: 10
  minutes.  By food processor: 1 minute). Add a little flour if too
  wet. . .a little water if too dry.  Place in clean, greased bowl,
  cover tightly and allow to rise until doubled in volume, about 1
  hour).  Punch down.
  PREPARATION:  Boil water with 1 T. malt syrup in large pan (The malt
  syrup makes the bagels shine). Prepare cookie sheet sprinkled with
  corn meal or polenta. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
  SHAPING AND 2ND RISE:  Either (1) Flatten and cut into eighteen 6"
  strips, or (2) Divide dough into 18 pieces, each a little larger
  than a golf ball (whichever shaping method tickles your fancy).
  Allow dough to relax for 5 minutes. If you chose #1, join the 2 ends
  together. If you chose #2, flatten the dough ball with palm of hand.
  Poke a hole in the middle, push finger through, and swing around on
  your finger until the hole looks large enough (remember that the
  hole will get smaller during the water bath). Cover with cloth and
  allow to rise slightly for 10 minutes, no more (It will rise more in
  the water bath).
  WATER BATH:  Just before bagels are ready to cook, reduce the heat
  under the water to a gentle bubble.  Drop bagels with a skimmer or a
  slotted spatula or spoon into water bath. Only do 4 or 5 at a time
  (so they have enough room to expand a little). With the water at a
  simmer, cook 2 minutes on one side, flip it over and cook 1 minute
  on the other. Remove from water bath, drain momentarily on a paper
  towel, and place on cookie sheet.
  BAKING, EGG WASH, TOPPINGS: Place cookie sheet of bagels into oven,
  middle shelf, and bake for 10 minutes. Remove and brush with egg
  wash (egg white beaten with 1 tsp. cold water).  Sprinkle topping of
  choice on top (sauteed onions or garlic, soaked (reconstituted)
  dehydrated onions onions or garlic, Kosher salt, poppy seeds, sesame
  seeds, what have you), and return to the oven.  Bake another 5 to 10
  minutes, turning them over 3 or 4 minutes before they are done.
  Cool on a rack.
  Variation: Add rum soaked raisins to dough before kneading. Top with
  cinnamon sugar during baking.

      Title: Buurebrot / Swiss Half-Rye Bread
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 10 servings
 
    150 g  Rye flour                           1 ts Salt
    850 g  Strong white flour                  1 ts Dry yeast
      3 c  Water                          
 
  ("Strong white" flour is the UK term for all-purpose flour.) Mix the yeast
  in 1/2 C of the water at blood heat, and leave 15 minutes to proof. Sift
  the mixed wheat and rye flours into a mixing bowl to warm. When the yeast
  has proofed, make a well in the flour, pour the yeast mixture in, and cover
  it over with a little flour. Leave for 20 minutes to "set the sponge". When
  this time has elapsed, begin mixing (or kneading with the dough hook if
  using a mixer). Add 2 cups of the water, check for texture, and add the
  rest if necessary. Knead vigorously. If using a dough hook, somewhere about
  10 minutes into the process the dough will suddenly change texture and
  require more flour. Add it (probably about another 150 g). Turn the dough
  into an oiled bowl to rise. The texture will be somewhat sticky. After
  allowing to rise for 1-1&1/2 hours, turn out of the bowl, punch down, and
  divide into two loaves. Turn into nonstick pans (or greased ones) and allow
  to rise for another hour. Bake at 220C for 35 minutes. Turn out of the pans
  and allow to sit in the still-hot oven upside down for 5 minutes to harden
  the crusts. Let sit overnight before cutting.

     30 g  Dried ceps or other mushroom        8 dl Bouillon
    100 g  Butter                            100 g  Grated cheese
      1 x  Onion, chopped fine               250 g  Veal, cut into thin strips
    1/8 ts Saffron, broken up small            1 dl Heavy cream
      1 dl Red wine                            2 x  Tomatoes, skinned and cubed
    350 g  Risotto rice (Arborio)              1 x  Bunch parsley, chopped fine
 
  Soak the mushrooms, then drain and dry well.  Reserve 2 dl of the soaking
  liquid.  Melt 40 g of the butter in a pan: add the onion, mushrooms, garlic
  and saute quickly; then add the red wine and lower the heat so that it's
  partly absorbed.  Then add the rice and saffron and stir well. Add the
  bouillon and the mushroom-water, stir, and reduce heat to a simmer.
   Cook slowly until the liquid is absorbed.  The rice should be al dente. --
  The butter and grated cheese are tossed in with the risotto when it's
  complete.  -- Flour the veal lightly and saute it in more butter;
   when done, lower the heat and add the cream, stirring carefully. Make a
  "dent" in the middle of the risotto and ladle the veal-and-cream mixture
  into this.  As a garnish, saute the tomatoes and parsley in the rest of the
  butter, and scatter over the top of the risotto.
   Serve.

      Title: Christmas Cake (British)
 Categories: Desserts, Cakes
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      2 lb Mixed dried fruit                   4 x  Eggs
      4 oz Glace' cherries                   1/2 ts Flavoring (vanilla, lemon)
      4 oz Candied fruit                       1 tb Blackstrap molasses
      3 oz Blanched almonds                    8 oz Butter
     10 oz Plain flour                         8 oz Soft brown sugar
      1 x  Pinch salt                          1 x  Whisky to soak fruit
    1/4 ts Bicarbonate of soda               250 ml Milk (to mix)
      1 ts Mixed spice                    
 
  (Note: (1) The mixed dried fruit should be such things as seedless raisins
  and currants. (2) The 1/2 teaspoon of "flavoring" can be almond, or lemon,
  or vanilla, or a mixture of the three. (3) "Mixed spice" is a combination
  of cinnamon, allspice and mace: about 1/3 of each.) -- Find a 9-inch cake
  pan at least three inches deep; grease it, and line the bottom and sides
  with a double thickness of greased baking parchment. Tie folded brown paper
  or newspaper around the outside of the pan. (The paper is insulation, to
  keep the sides of the cake from scorching as it bakes.) Set oven to
  320-300F: have folded paper to stand the pan on when baking -- place low in
  oven. Pick over the dried fruit, removing any stems, etc. Wash, drain well
  and spread over a cloth on a tray to dry. When dry, put in a bowl and pour
  a small wine-glass of spirit over it. Cover well and leave overnight. --
  Next day, add chopped peel, blanched chopped almonds, and cherries minced
  and drained. Mix thoroughly. Sift together the flour, salt, soda and spice.
  Beat the eggs well with the molasses and flavoring. Put the butter into a
  large warmed bowl and beat until soft; then add the sugar and beat until
  light and creamy. Beat in the egg mixture, about a sixth of it at a time,
  then fold in half the flour mixture. Add remainder of the flour to the
  fruit and mix well. Add fruit to creamed mixture and fold in well. Put into
  pan and bake for about 3 1/2 to 4 hours or until done. If top of cake is
  browning too fast, cover with a few thicknesses of paper. Reduce the oven
  heat slightly every hour -- about 10 degrees. Test with skewer for
  doneness. Keep the paper wrapped around the cake in place until completely
  cooled, so that the cooling takes place slowly. After completely cooled,
  invert the cake, lift the baking parchment off the bottom, and sprinkle the
  cake generously with the spirit of your choice. Wrap well in foil, put in a
  sealed tin, and keep in a cool place (not necessarily refrigerated) . The
  cake benefits from occasional unwrappings and sprinkling with more spirit.
  It takes about 2 months to achieve maximum "mellowness".

      1 c  Beef stock                        1/2 oz Fresh parsley
      1 c  Chicken stock                       1 x  Small onion
  3 3/4 lb Mealy potatoes                    1/2 c  Salad dressing
 
  (This recipe is an early approximation of the original recipe. All amounts
  have been converted from the original metric, and reduced.)
  
  Salad dressing:  About 1/2 C of a good mayonnaise, the fresher the better
  ~- I think the Zeughauskeller makes their own fresh, every day -- mixed to
  taste with German-style mustard (i.e. a sharp yellow mustard rather than a
  brown one).
  
  Every utensil must be scrupulously clean, then scalded, including pans. --
  Peel and cut up potatoes. Cook until "almost ready", then drain (trying to
  retain starch).  Put in pan.  -- Pour BOILING stock over potatoes to bring
  out the starch and bind the potatoes together. Let sit 45 minutes to
  absorb.  -- Chop parsley and onions (to taste) by hand. Add to potatoes,
  toss;  let sit in hot mixture to add flavor.
   -- Pour salad dressing over salad:  toss.

      Title: Fougasse Aux Grattons (Flat Bread with Crackling
 Categories: Breads, Meats
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 ea Pkg active dry yeast                1 lb Belly of pork, diced
      1 lb Flour*                              2 lb Pork fat, diced
    250 ml Tepid water                        12 tb Dry white wine
      1 ea Egg yolk, beaten               
 
  *Flour should be a mixture of unbleached white bread flour with 2 generous
  handfuls of buckwheat flour, sifted together. If you can't find the
  buckwheat flour, don't worry about it.
  
  For the dough: Stir together the yeast and a handful of flour in enough
  water to make a runny batter. Leave for 1 hour. Warm the remaining flour in
  the oven, mix in salt and make a well in the middle. Pour in the yeast
  mixture and add enough tepid water to make a moist dough. Knead for 10-12
  minutes on a lightly floured surface. Leave to rise in a large floured bowl
  covered with a dampened cloth. When the dough has doubled in size, turn out
  onto a floured work surface, punch down and flatten the dough out. Add the
  grattons (see immediately below for how to make them). Preheat the oven to
  450F/250C.
  
  For the grattons: Cook the meat, fat and wine over a *very* gentle heat in
  a heavy covered saucepan. Press down on the meat several times during
  cooking to render up as much fat as possible. After 1 1/2 - 2 hours, pour
  the liquid off through a strainer. (It can be used instead of olive oil for
  cooking, and often was, in Provencal cooking.) Crisp the diced meat over
  higher heat, straining off any liquid fat when necessary.
  
  To make the fougasse, make the bread dough, and after the first rising mix
  in the grattons. Then, with a knife, cut through the dough first one way,
  then another. Reform into a ball and repeat. Gather the pieces together
  into a mass, divine in two and form into two flat loaves, slashed straight
  through their thickness in numerous places. Spread the holes wider with
  your fingers. (You are striving for an effect like a flat sheet of bread
  with holes like those of a slice of swiss cheese.) Brush the top with the
  egg yolk and bake on a hot metal sheet for 30-35 minutes until crisp and
  golden. Serve warm with a bitter salad like endive or dandelion.
  
  NB:  this is a very rich bread -- more like a salty shortbread than
  anything else.  But *very* good.

      Title: "English" Muffins (Bakestone Recipes)
 Categories: Muffins, Breads, Breakfast
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb All-purpose or bread flour          1 ts Sugar
      1 ts Salt                                8 fl Warm milk and water
  1 1/2 tb Dry yeast                           2 oz Butter, melted
 
  (Note:  Over here, and in England, these are just called "muffins", and are
  the ones in the song about the Muffin Man who lives in Drury Lane. They did
  actually sell them door-to-door every morning in London until the turn of
  the century or thereabouts.) . Sift the flour and salt into a bowl and
  leave in a warm place. Dissolve the yeast and sugar in 1/4 pt of the warm
  milk and water.  Leave to froth, then mix in the fat. Stir all the liquid
  into the warm flour and beat well until smooth and elastic. Cover and prove
  in a warm place for 50 minutes or until doubled in bulk. Turn onto a
  well-floured board and knead, working a little more flour if necessary to
  make the dough easier to shape. Round up the dough, roll into a thick
  sausage shape and (using the sharpest knife you have) slice into 8 to 10
  portions, each about 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 inch thick. Shape each one into a round
  with straight sides.  Put onto a greased baking sheet.
   Cover (I use greased plastic wrap) and put in a warm place to prove for
  30-40 minutes or until springy to the touch. Leave room for expansion and
  be careful not to over-prove, as the muffins will get flabby and lose their
  shape.   Warm and grease the bakestone lightly.
   Lift the muffins carefully onto the bakestone and cook over very moderate
  heat for 8-10 minutes until pale gold underneath. Turn and cook the other
  side.
   Wrap in a cloth and keep warm if cooking in batches.
   To serve, insert a knife in the side, pull the top and bottom slightly
  apart, and insert slivers of butter. . These are strongly recommended. The
  taste of them hot off the bakestone, griddle or frying pan makes Thomas's
  look very poor indeed by comparison.

      1 ea Celery stalk; chopped               1 x  Sour cream
      1 ea Turnip, large; peel/diced      
 
  Approx. Cook Time: 8:00 Soak the porcini in 1 cup water for 2 hours. Drain
  them, pat dry with paper towels, chop fine, and set aside. Discard the
  liquid or save for another use. To make the stock, in a large soup pot,
  bring the meat, bones, and water to a boil over high heat, periodically
  skimming off the foam as it rises to the top. Add the remaining stock
  ingredients, and reduce the heat to low. Simmer, covered, until the meat is
  tender; about two hours. Meanwhile, melt half the butter in a deep skillet
  over medium heat. Add the cabbage and sauerkraut and saute for 10 minutes,
  tossing and stirring regularly.  Add one cup hot stock (it doesn't have to
  be fully cooked) and the tomato paste. Cover and simmer over low heat for
  35 to 40 minutes. Melt the remaining butter in another large skillet and
  saute the carrot, onions, celery, turnip, and mushrooms until soft and
  lightly browned; about 15 minutes. When the stock is ready, strain it into
  a clean pot.  Reserve the meat and discard the other solids. Add the
  sauerkraut and cabbage, the vegetable mixture, and tomatoes to the stock.
  Season with salt and pepper, stir, and cook, covered, over medium-low heat
  for 20 minutes. Cut the meat into bite-size pieces and add it to the soup,
  along with the minced garlic.  Simmer for another five minutes. Let stand
  for at least 15 minutes, and preferably a day and a night, before serving;
  refrigerate, covered, and reheat slowly if serving the next day. Serve
  garnished with fresh dill and sour cream, if desired.

      Title: Chicken Baked in Milk (Pollo Al Latte)
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 ea Chicken, 2 1/2 lb                   1 ea Clove garlic
      1 qt Milk                                6 ea Coriander seeds
      2 oz Butter                              1 x  A little basil or marjoram
      2 oz Ham or bacon                        1 x  Salt and pepper
      1 ea Onion                          
 
  Ask the butcher to split the chicken into two halves. Or just joint the
  chicken as usual. . Rub the chicken with salt and pepper, and a cut clove
  of garlic.  Melt the butter in a frying pan and brown the chicken in it,
  together with the chopped onion, ham or bacon, and finely chopped garlic.
  Lay the chicken pieces and the other ingredients, including all the hot
  butter, in a casserole or other fireproof dish. In a separate pan, heat the
  milk to boiling point, with the coriander seeds and a pinch of basil or
  marjoram. Now pour it, with the seeds and herbs, over the chicken. Add a
  pinch of salt and black pepper. Bring the milk to simmering point again and
  keep simmering, uncovered, at a moderate pace -- the milk should bubble
  visibly but not fiercely -- for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Don't touch it during
  this period, and you should see a golden skin forming over the contents of
  the pot while the milk bubbles away underneath. At the end of this time,
  stir the skin into the milk, together with any crusty bits sticking to the
  sides of the pan.  The milk will have reduced quite a bit now, and will be
  getting thick.  Continue simmering for another 1/2 hour, till the sauce has
  reduced to a cupful or so, watching carefully to see that it does not
  "catch" and burn. . This dish can be eaten either hot or cold. If hot,
  serve the chicken from the pan, as it is, with some of the thick sauce.
  Nice with noodles and peas.   If it is to be eaten cold, lay the chicken
  pieces out flat on a plate amd coat them carefully with the remaining
  sauce, before leaving them to cool.

      Title: Shin of Beef Stewed in Wine
 Categories: Meats, French
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6 oz Fat bacon or salt pork              1 ea Bouquet garni
      1 ea Large onion                         8 oz Red wine (or more)
      1 tb Olive oil                           1 ts Salt
      5 lb Shin beef off the bone              8 oz Beef stock or water
      2 ea Cloves garlic                  
 
  Cut the bacon or salt pork into small cubes and put them, with a tablespoon
  of olive oil, into a heavy and fairly wide iron or earthenware pot. When
  the bacon fat runs, add a large sliced onion and stir about until slightly
  brown.  On top, arrange the shin of beef, off the bone, skinned, excess fat
  removed, and cut lengthways into thick pieces. Add the cloves of garlic,
  crushed but not chopped, and the bouquet garni (either one of the "instant"
  ones, or a small bunch of parsley, thyme and bayleaf, tied up with a
  string).  Pour in a large glass of red wine (about 8 oz) and let all come
  to a fast boil for 4-5 minutes. Add about the same amount of beef stock or
  water, and allow to boil again.  Add salt. . Cover the pot with paper or
  foil and a well-fitting lid. Transfer to a very slow oven, 290 degrees F or
  gas mark 1, and in about 3 hours it will be cooked.
   Or you can half-cook it one day, remove it, and finish it the next. Serve
  with potatoes or rice to soak up the sauce. (Egg noodles also work well if
  you thicken the sauce slightly.) This dish can also be simmered *very*
  slowly on top of the stove.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 oz Dry pasta (any type)                     Water
           Salt                           
 
  1. Fill large stock pot with water (6 to 8 quarts). Pasta should have
  enough room to swim around freely. (you need at least 1 quart of water for
  each 4 oz. of dry pasta.
  2. After water has come to a rolling boil, add salt (1 tablespoon per
  pound of dry pasta). DO NOT ADD OIL, it will make the sauce slide off.
  3. Pour pasta in water and stir constantly until water returns to boiling.
  (Stirring prevents pasta from sticking together).
  4. Start timimg the pasta once the water is boiling. As pasta cooks, Stir
  occasionally to keep it moving in the water. To determine doneness, scoop
  up a piece and bite into it. Pasta should be tender, yet resilient to the
  bite. Pasta should NEVER be cooked until mushy.
  5. Drain pasta in a large collander in the sink. DO NOT RINSE THE PASTA,
  unless it is to be used in a salad. (The reason: Pasta needs the starch on
  the surface to mix with the sauce to thicken it).
  6. Use 2 oz dry pasta for each serving. (Contains about 225 calories and
  no chol but lots of complex carbohydrates).

      Title: Best Ever Potato Salad
 Categories: Salads, Vegetables
      Yield: 16 servings
 
     16 md Small Potatoes                  1 1/2 tb Pickle relish
    3/4 c  Mayonaise                         3/4 tb Dry parsley flakes
  1 1/2 ts Yellow Mustard                           Pinch of Celery Salt
     12    Eggs, hard boiled.                1/2 md White onion, diced
      1 c  Apple cider vinegar                 4    Celery stalks, split
 
  Gather ingredients. The half cup of sprinkling vinegar should be just
  estimated from the bottle as you sprinkle. It's just a conservative
  guestimate and the exact amount will depend upon the amount of potatoes to
  sprinkle. Don't worry about it too much. Boil potatoes whole. If your
  potato size varies much, put in the larger ones first. A medium sized
  potato will take ABOUT 25 minutes total. A smaller one maybe 18 minutes.
  One of the keys here is to boil the potatoes till cooked but still a little
  firm. If they are cooked till soft, then the subsequent stirring will
  render the salad mushy. You don't want them crunchy, but just cooked and
  still firm. That's the first secret! Peel the potatoes when they are still
  warm. The warmer the better. Peeling them AFTER they are cooked seems to
  make a difference in taste. They MUST not cool entirely or the vinegar will
  not be absorbed properly. I peel them almost straight out of the pot when
  still darn hot. That's the second secret! Cut them into irregular chunks,
  little wedges about an inch or slightly less on a side with the greatest
  thickness about a half inch. Just cut a little off one end, then cut
  another small chunk off, then keep cutting pieces off in random sizes of
  varying shapes, mostly you end up with very irregular pyramidal
  shapes....You want pieces big enough to not turn into mush but small enough
  for ...your liking! The edges will eventually break off and mush up onto
  the salad while the larger parts of the bodies will remain whole. You are
  cutting, peeling and dropping them into a large bowl. There really should
  be two people doing this or one should work as quickly as possible. After
  you have cut up a potato or two, sprinkle them fairly generously vinegar
  and stir around a bit in the bowl..just a bit so you get the vinegar that
  fell to the bottom of the bowl on the potatoes. As you finish a potato or
  two, sprinkle each (they should be warm to hot when you sprinkle, if
  possible...THAT's the BIG secret to this recipe)  fairly generously. I put
  my finger over the end of the bottle of cider vinegar and drizzly drip it
  onto the potatoes making sure each is sprinkled well. If you run out of the
  half cup, just use more. Each potato gets a fairly generous sprinkling of
  vinegar. THAT point is more important than the measurement of the 1/2 cup
  of vinegar above. Note: I don't measure out a half cup and then pour it on
  them. That would be awkward. I did measure this once out so I could have a
  recipe for a friend and I learned I sprinkled ABOUT a half a cup. Salt them
  at this point; I don't know how much....Just salt them like you like. The
  vinegar needs a comment. The importance of a generous sprinkling of vinegar
  while the potatoes are warm/hot can't be over emphasized. They will soak up
  the vinegar. I am always amazed at how much vinegar it takes and how when
  they are done, the vinegar is tasted, but the dish is not 'vinegary' like a
  hot German potato salad which I hate....trust in a good sprinkling of
  vinegar at this point and if in doubt, sprinkle a little more! Stir in the
  other ingredients, leaving the eggs to last. Chop up the eggs, slicing,
  cutting in whatever size/shape you wish but we are not talking about whole
  or half eggs here. Cut them up. The yolks will fall apart when sliced up
  and that's ok. Stir all the eggs into the rest of the mix. The yolks will
  incorporate into the salad and you don't have to worry about them; don't
  stir forever or worry about being gentle or anything. Just mix it up. Add
  the other 1/2 cup of vinegar. If you are a real chicken, you may wish to
  add only a 1/4 cup but it will probably take it all (and maybe even a bit
  more eventually). Take a taste. Add some more salt if needed. It will be
  good but not perfect at this point. Taste it again. Note the vinegar flavor
  peeking through. It may even be fairly vinegary (that's a word, right?).
  Cover and put in a fridge over night. That's the last big secret. Taste
  again after sitting in the fridge overnight. Notice that the vinegar flavor
  is much softer. Add some more vinegar and let that absorb for an hour or
  two. You may well have used much more than the 1 cup total by this point.
  Salt to taste if needed. You can serve this without the over-night setting
  but it will truly be a noticeably better salad the next day. You will want
  to adjust the amount of mayo to suit your taste. I like a pretty mayoee
  salad. Probably even a bit more than this calls for. Some don't. You may
  want more or less celery. My wife doesn't like any (egads!) None of these
  amounts need be exact, but they are close enough for a good starting point.
  The key is to use more vinegar than you could have imagined, sprinkling
  well while the potatoes are hot and firm but not crunchy. The rest is all
  to taste. I've never served this to a group that didn't ohh and ahh over
  it. It is a bit of an effort but if you take the time you will have some of
  the best potato salad ever.

           -Greek oil)                    
 
  Scrub potatoes and place in a saucepan with water enough to just cover
  them. Cover the pan, bring to a boil, and boil until potatoes are barely
  tender, about 15 - 20 minutes. Remove potatoes and let cool until
  comfortable to handle, then peel them, cube them and place in a large bowl.
  In a small bowl stir the mustard and vinegar together and then beat in the
  olive oil.  Pour the mixture over the potatoes and gently toss and coat
  well. Cover and refrigerate 2 to 3 hours. After potatoes have cooled add
  the scallions, celery, mayonnaise, celery seed and salt and pepper to
  taste. Again toss gently but thoroughly. Turn into a serving bowl lined
  with lettuce if you like, slice the eggs and arrange in a circle around the
  outside of the salad.  Cover and refrigerate or serve at once. SOME
  SUGGESTIONS:  When I have BBQ I usually eat the salad as the recipe states,
  or with a little Hungarian paprika sprinkled over the top.

      Title: Ricotta Cheese
 Categories: Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 8 servings
 
  2 1/2 qt Milk (whole)                        5 tb Lemon juice, fresh, plus 1 t
    3/4 c  Cream, heavy, less 1 tbs          1/8 ts Salt
 
  Must be made in one session, about 1 1/2 hrs.
  
  Stir together all the ingredients except the salt in a heavy 6-quart
  saucepan with a nonreactive interior.  Set the pan over medium-LOW heat.
  Cook 40 minutes, or until the milk reaches 170 F.  Keep the heat at
  medium-low.  To keep the curd large, do not stir more than 3 or 4 times. If
  you lift it with the spatula, you will see sandlike particles of milk
  forming as the clear whey begins separating from the curd. As the milk
  comes close to 170, the curds will be slightly larger, about the size of an
  uncooked lentil.  When the temp reaches 170, turn the heat up to medium. DO
  NOT STIR.  Take 6 to 8 minutes to bring the mixture to 205-208 when
  measured at the center of the pot. The liquid whey will be almost clear. By
  the time cheese comes to 205, the curd should mound on the spatula like a
  soft white custard. At 205-208 the liquid will be on the verge of boiling,
  with the surface looking like mounds about to erupt. Turn off the heat and
  let the cheese stand 10 minutes.
  
  Line a colander with a double thickness of dampened cheesecloth. Turn the
  mixture into it, and let it drain 15 minutes, or until the drained cheese
  is thick.  Turn the cheese into a covered storage container, add salt if
  desired, and refrigerate the ricotta until needed. Source: Splendid Table

      Title: Hearty Brisket From "The Only Texas Cookbook"
 Categories: Brisket, Beef, Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 20 servings
 
      8 lb Brisket (8 to 10 lb)                1 tb Salt
    1/4 c  Dry red wine                        5    Cloves garlic, minced
      1 tb Molasses                            2    Onions, minced fine
    1/4 c  Soy sauce                           2    Stalks celery, minced fine
      1 ts Peppercorns                              Pepper, coarsely ground
 
  Make a marinade of wine, molasses, soy sauce, peppercorns, salt garlic,
  onions, and celery. (You can put onions and celery in processor until
  almost pureed.) Lay the boned and trimmed brisket on a large piece of
  heavy- duty foil and spread the marinade over all surfaces. Wrap the
  brisket tightly. Place in refrigerator and marinate for 24 hours. Open foil
  and sprinkle the brisket generously with freshly milled pepper. Reseal,
  place in a large open roasting pan (or jelly roll pan). Place in a 200-deg
  oven and cook for 8 hours. Remove from oven. Rewrap the meat in a clean
  sheet of foil. Reserve pan juices and serve with warm meat. Good hot or
  cold on sandwiches. Serves 20
  ...............................................
  Cooking a brisket recalls an elementary law of physics. What happens to
  water at 212-deg? It boils away. By cooking a brisket at 200-deg. all the
  inherent juices are saved and the meat is made more tender than you ever
  imagined. It is important that the cooking sack be completely sealed--a
  good method is to use what is called a drugstore wrap. Here's what you do.
  You'll probably notice that a brisket is too wide to seal in one width of
  foil, so you will need to seal 4 sides. Here's how: Tear off 2 large equal
  lengths of foil. Lay 1 on top of the other. Now fold 1 side over twice,
  making a narrow 1/2-inch double fold. Open out the 2 sheets, and you'll
  have a good seal on the bottom. Lay the meat on top of the seam. Coat all
  surfaces with the marinade. Now life the 2 remaining sides of foil up and,
  holding them even with each other, fold over and over in 1/2-inch folds
  until you have a tight package. Press fold flat against the meat. This is
  what should be touching all surfaces of the meat snugly. You just have to
  be careful not to puncture it during the cooking and handling process.
  When I cook this brisket, I do the whole thin after supper. The first
  night I make the marinade and place meat in the refrigerator; the next
  night I put it in the oven just before going to bed. By morning it is
  cooked to a turn.  A good working woman's scheme. You can eat this for
  several days without screaming.

    1/2    Diced green pepper                1/2 c  Cream or milk
    1/2    Diced onion                              Your favorite spices

    1/2 c  Red or white wine                        Salt & pepper
 
  Heat olive oil in large skillet till water sizzles.  Add 1/2 diced green
  pepper, 1/2 diced onion, 1 to 2 crushed & diced cloves garlic, and a couple
  chopped large tomatoes (peeled if you prefer).  You can also add other
  veggies if you wish.  After they saute for about 5 minutes, add one cup
  tomato sauce, 1/2 cup red or white wine (or stock, or water from the
  cooking pasta), and 1/2 cup cream (or milk). Flavor with a sprinkle of
  oregano, basil, salt and pepper. Turn down heat and simmer about 5 minutes.

  cook-all-day sauces; it is more fresh and vibrant, but not as complex. It
  will accomodate almost any vegetable you choose to add. Try eggplant or
  broccoli or asparagus, just to name a few.

      6 oz Can tomato paste                   16 oz Can tomato sauce
      8 oz Red wine                            1 ts Sugar
           Plenty oregano, basil               1 lg Bay leaf
           -marjoram                                Pinch each thyme, rosemary
           Dashes ground fennel                     Lots parmesan cheese
           -red pepper flakes                  2    Slices american cheese
 
  In a dutch oven, brown the sausages well (still in their casings) in a
  little olive oil.  Use tongs to remove sausage to top of pot lid. Drain off
  fat if necessary, leaving about 1 tbs in pot.  Toss in onion, green pepper
  and garlic and stir to coat, scraping up the brown bits from bottom of pot.
  Let cook for about 2 minutes, just 'til the onion and pepper begin to
  soften (do not brown).  Return sausage to pot and stir in tomatoes or
  sauce, paste, sugar, wine, seasonings and parmesan. Simmer for 45-60
  minutes.  Meanwhile, saute mushrooms in a dab of butter, dash of olive oil,
  sprinkle of marjoram or basil and paprika.  Add the mushrooms and any juice
  in the pan to the saucepot during last 15 minutes of cooking. Add optional
  american cheese a few minutes before serving, let melt & stir in. This
  really mellows out the sauce Tips:  You can brown pork shoulder blades or
  spareribs along with the sausage.  Gives a great flavor and provides a 2nd
  meat course if you're having company.  Use more or less wine, depending on
  whether you're using whole tomatoes or sauce.  Just aim for a nice thick
  sauce. Leftovers make great sausage sandwiches.  I freeze mine a lot for
  quick meals later.

           Salt and pepper                     1 c  Beef broth
      2 c  Boiling water                       2 tb Tomato paste
     10    Dried shiitake mushrooms          1/4 ts Fennel seeds
      2    Onions, chopped                     6    Kale leaves, or outer
      2 tb Olive oil                                -cabbage leaves
      4 oz Pancetta, diced (prosciutto         2 c  Cooked, drained cranberry
           -or other full-flavored                  -beans or borlotti beans
           -ham may be substituted)            1 lb Pappardelle
      3    Garlic cloves, chopped                   Freshly grated cheese,
      1    Carrot, diced                            -to taste
      6    Sage leaves                    
 
  Sprinkle duck generously with salt and pepper, prick the skin well with a
  fork (this helps the fat to drain out), then place in a roasting pan and
  roast, uncovered, in a 350 degree oven about 45 minutes. Pour off fat from
  pan once or twice during cooking, and discard. Meanwhile, pour the boiling
  water over mushrooms. Cover and let rehydrate. Set aside. Lightly saute
  onion in olive oil with pancetta, garlic and carrot until onion is
  softened, then add half of the sage and the rosemary. Pour in half of the
  wine; boil down until reduced by about half, then add remaining wine and
  half of the broth. Continue to boil down for about 5 minutes, then add
  tomato paste and fennel seeds. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes over low
  heat.  When duck is cool enough to handle, remove skin and bones. Cut meat
  into bite-sized pieces and add to sauce. Blanch the greens quickly in
  boiling water, drain and run under cold water. Cut into bite-sized pieces.
  Add to the simmering sauce, along with the beans. Pour all the fat out of
  duck-roasting pan. Place pan over medium heat and add remaining broth,
  stirring to incorporate any full-flavored bits. Add this liquid to the
  simmering sauce, along with remaining sage leaves. Remove mushrooms from
  their soaking liquid, discard stems, and slice caps; add to sauce. Strain
  the mushroom-soaking liquid through a double layer of cheesecloth or a
  paper coffee filter, and add to the sauce. If the sauce is too thin, strain
  into a saucepan and boil down until reduced in volume and intensified in
  flavor. Return to sauce solids. Cook pappardelle until al dente, then serve
  with the sauce. Sprinkle cheese on top. Serves 4 to 6.

 Categories: Sauces, Pasta
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4 md To large artichokes             1 1/2 c  Whipping cream
      1 tb Flour                                    Salt and pepper, to taste
      1    Lemon, cut in half                  1 lb Rigatoni, or other medium
    1/2 md Onion, chopped                           -large tubular pasta
      1    Garlic clove, chopped                    Freshly grated Parmesan,
      2 tb Butter                                   -to taste
    3/4 c  Broth chicken                  
 
  Prepare artichokes by bending back the outer leaves until they snap off.
  The edible bit at the end should remain on the heart, which you will cook
  for the sauce, When all the tough leaves have been snapped off, and only
  the tenderest ones remain, trim them with a knife: First strip the stem of
  its tough skin, trim the base, and cut off the sharp top of the tender
  inner leaves. You now have artichoke hearts. Cut each heart into quarters
  and trim the inner choke away, then place the quarters in a saucepan with
  water to cover. Mix in the flour and add the lemon halves. Bring to a boil,
  reduce heat and cook a few minutes until artichoke quarters are al dente.
  Remove from heat, drain, discard the lemon and let artichokes cool. (This
  may be done up to 3 days ahead.) Dice artichoke quarters and set aside.
  Lightly saute the onion and garlic in the butter. When softened, add the
  diced artichokes and cook for a few minutes. Add broth and bring to a boil;
  reduce heat and simmer several minutes until artichokes are quite tender.
  Add cream and cook through, until sauce is thickened. Season with pepper.
  Salt is unlikely to be needed because both broth and Parmesan are salty.
  Cook pasta until al dente. Drain and toss with sauce. Sprinkle with
  Parmesan and serve immediately. Variation: For a lemony, olivey sauce
  rather than a creamy one, omit cream and add 2 to 3 tablespoons chopped
  parsley, 5 to 10 pitted and halved Kalamata olives, and a teaspoon or 2 of
  capers to the broth, along with artichokes. Cook down until reduced by
  about half, then add a squeeze of lemon. Serve on a thin pasta such as
  spaghetti. Serves 4 to 6.

      2 c  Fresh* or canned fruit              1 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine                 1 c  Self rising flour
           -(don't use shortening)                  *optional sugar to taste
      1 c  Sugar                          
 
  If you are using fresh or frozen fruit bring it to a boil with optional
  sugar and a little water on the stove. Reduce heat and cook until it begins
  to form a light syrup.  You do not want a lot of liquid and if using canned
  fruit you should drain it first.  Canned fruit does not need to be
  sweetened as above.  Select a deep baking dish, preferably one which can be
  heated on top of the stove.  Melt the butter in you dish over low heat. In
  a separate bowl mix together the milk, sugar, and flour to form a batter.
  Carefully pour the batter into the center of the melted butter and do not
  stir.  Next pour the fruit into the middle of the butter-batter and do not
  stir.  Bake on 350 F until the crust rises and turns a rich golden brown.

  fry in vegetable oil, turning once, until browned.  Drain on grocery bag
  (to absorb oil) and dust with confectioner's sugar. Yield:  depends on how

      1    Bunch broccoli, cut into                 Pinch tarragon

           -and cubed                               -6 to 8 pieces
      4 sm To md-sized young carrots          12 oz Delicate fettuccine
    1/2 c  Dry white wine                           -preferably fresh
    1/2 c  Broth                          
 
  Steam spinach until just bright green. Let cool. Squeeze out liquid and
  chop into bite-sized pieces, then arrange in mounds on the edge of a
  serving plate. Steam broccoli florets until bright green and still crunchy,
  remove from steamer and place on platter alongside spinach. Dice 2 of the
  carrots and place in a small saucepan with the wine, broth, onion or
  shallots, garlic and tarragon. Bring to a boil, cover, and cook until
  carrots are tender. Uncover and boil until liquid is reduced to about 2
  tablespoons: Remove from heat. Mash carrots with their liquid, using a fork
  or food processor. When the mixture cools to just warm, whisk in the
  butter. Set aside. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add broccoli stems
  and pasta. It should take about 3 minutes for both the pasta and broccoli
  to be cooked to perfection. (Judge doneness by the pasta -- it's better to
  have the broccoli underdone than the pasta overdone.) Meanwhile, finely
  grate remaining carrots. When pasta and broccoli are al dente, drain and
  serve, surrounded by the spinach mounds and broccoli florets. Spoon
  carrot-butter over pasta and vegetables, and sprinkle grated carrot over
  the top. Serve immediately. Serves 4 to 6.

  held vertically in oil. Meanwhile, dredge drumsticks in cornstarch; shake
  off excess starch. Deep-fry drumsticks 2 at a time until brown, about 5
  minutes. Remove from oil; drain. Red-cooking: Pour water in sandy pot or
  comparable casserole dish; add 5-spice bouquet, soy sauce, sherry & salt
  (5-spice powder can be substituted, though the final flavor will be less
  distinctive). Slowly bring to boil, reduce heat, cover pot & simmer 15
  minutes. Remove cover; discard bouquet; add salt & rock sugar; dissolve
  rock sugar. You can stop here until near serving time. About 30 minutes
  before serving time, add drumsticks & soaked chestnuts to hot red-cooked
  sauce.  Simmer in covered pot for 15 minutes; remove cover; simmer for
  another 15 minutes.  Sauce should have reduced by about 1/3, and become
  bright & thick. To serve, prop drumsticks up around sides of sandy pot;
  spear chestnuts with sate sticks or long toothpicks. Serves 8

      Title: Salt Baked Chicken
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 lb Fryer                               1    Whole star anise
      6 lb Rock salt                           2 tb Sherry
           Parchment paper                     1 tb Fresh ginger, minced
    1/4 c  Peanut oil                          1 tb Garlic, minced
      1 ts Salt                                2    Green onions,
      3 tb Dark soy sauce                           -coarsely chopped
 
  Preparation:  Wash chicken & pat dry.  Swab cavity with sherry; stuff with
  ginger, garlic & green onions; seal with clip or string.  Rub outside of
  chicken with dark soy sauce; allow to stand until soy sauce is absorbed.
  Wrap chicken in 3 layers of parchment paper, tie with string, coat outer
  layer with peanut oil. Baking: In wok or large pot, heat rock salt,
  stirring periodically, until it begins to brown. Place wrapped chicken in
  rock salt, spooning some salt around sides & over top. Cook for about 10
  minutes.  Turn over chicken, cover with rock salt (but always have at least
  2" layer of salt under chicken) & cook for another 10 minutes. This cooking
  time will give a moist, slightly underdone chicken. Increase baking time to
  15 minutes on each side, for well done. Remove chicken from salt; strip off
  paper; allow to stand for 15 minutes to cool & congeal juices. Cut in half,
  then into bite-size pieces. Serve with soy dip. Serves 4

      3 tb Cold water                          1 tb Cornstarch

-----------------------------------THICK-----------------------------------
      1 tb Cold water                          1 ts Cornstarch
 
  Our recipes call for cornstarch paste as the thickening agent without
  specifying the exact proportions of cornstarch and water.  This recipe is
  offered as an approximate guide until you find what works best for you.
  Some cooks prefer the thin paste, some prefer thick. Thoroughly mix
  together cornstarch and cold water.  Always stir mixture again just before
  using because the starch settles.

      Title: Shanghai Red-Cooked Chicken
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  3 1/2 lb Whole frying chicken              1/2 c  Medium sherry
    1/2 c  Dark soy sauce                    1/2 c  Thin soy sauce
  1 1/2 c  Vegetable oil for braising          1    Clove star anise
      2 tb Peanut oil for stewing              1 ts Salt
      4    Green onions                        3    Lumps rock sugar
    1/2 ts Minced fresh ginger                 1 tb Sesame oil
      4 c  Water                                    Cornstarch paste
 
  If serving more people, get more chickens.  Chickens should not exceed
  about 4 lbs. each. Marinating: Wash chicken thoroughly under cool water:
  dry.  Cut off fat pockets around cavity opening. Place chicken in snug
  bowl.  Brush or rub dark soy sauce into skin; let stand in bowl for 30
  minutes; repeat brushing several times. Remove from bowl. Braising: In wok
  heat oil for braising under medium high flame.  When oil is hot, but not
  smoking, quickly lower chicken into oil.  Protect yourself against
  splattering oil by holding wok lid over wok; don't actually cover it. Using
  large spoon, baste chicken with hot oil, & turn once or twice so skin
  browns evenly (about 10-15 minutes). Carefully remove chicken from wok,
  trying not to break skin. Stewing: Chop green onions into 2" sections. Heat
  peanut oil in heavy pot or dutch oven, in which chicken will fit snugly.
  When oil is hot, add green onions & ginger. Saute until onions are lightly
  brown.  Add water, sherry, thin soy, star anise & salt.  Bring mixture to
  boil.  While liquid is heating, loosely tie legs of chicken together with a
  piece of twine.  Lower chicken into boiling liquid. Bring liquid to boil
  again, then reduce heat for very slow simmer. Chicken should actually be
  floating free in liquid.  Cover & simmer for about 1 hour or until chicken
  is very tender.  Leave chicken in covered pot until 5 minutes before
  serving.  Then remove it carefully to serving platter; remove twine. Remove
  all but 1 cup of liquid from pot (including onion pieces). Bring liquid to
  boil; thicken slightly with cornstarch paste; glaze with sesame oil. Pour
  sauce over chicken & serve. Serves 4

      2 ts Black soy sauce                
 
  Marinating:  With sharp paring knife, scrape chicken meat from thigh; slice
  into thin strips across the grain.  (Breast meat is not preferred for this
  dish, as meat is too dry and spongy.)  Combine sherry, soy, cornstarch and
  sugar in bowl; massage liquid into meat with your fingers. Marinate for 15
  to 30 minutes. Preparation: Wash asparagus; peel tough white outer skin off
  ends; slice on diagonal in 2 1/2" sections. Rinse fermented black beans. In
  bowl, combine and mash black beans and garlic, brown sugar, black soy sauce
  and chicken stock; stir; reserve for 15 minutes. Stir Frying: Add 2/3 of
  oil to hot wok; when oil is very hot, add chicken. Stir-fry for about 3
  minutes on high heat - or until chicken begins to shrink and firm up.
  Remove chicken to holding bowl. Reheat wok to high, add remaining oil. When
  oil is hot, add black bean sauce. Stir-fry for 1 minute. Add asparagus; mix
  with sauce. Stir sauce with asparagus. When sauce boils, add cooked
  chicken; toss to combine. Dribble in a little cornstarch paste if needed;
  cornstarch in chicken marinade might be enough.  Toss ingredients until
  very little liquid remains and is reduced to glaze.  Dish is ready when
  asparagus brightens.  If you still have too much liquid, remove
  ingredients, continue to reduce sauce, then return ingredients to coat them
  with sauce.  Serve in individual portions.  Serves 6

      Title: Braised & Deep Fried Pork Slices in Wine Sauce
 Categories: Pork, Meats
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 ts Red rice vinegar                    3    Cloves garlic, minced
      2 tb Medium sherry                       2    Egg yolks
    3/4 c  Stock                               1 ts Water
           Cornstarch paste                    1 c  Fine plain bread crumbs
  1 1/2 lb Boned pork butt                     4 c  Oil for deep-frying
      3 tb Peanut oil                    

-----------------------------------PASTE-----------------------------------
      2 tb Cooked rice                         2 tb Dark soy sauce
    1/2 ts Sugar                               2 tb Warm water
      1 ts Dry baker's yeast                   1 ts Wet bean cheese (opt)
 
  Prepare Paste:  Use mortar and pestle to pulverize cooked rice. Combine
  with sugar, yeast, soy and warm water.  Let stand in warm place for 30
  minutes to activate yeast.  Authentic wine lees paste is not available in
  the U.S. to our knowledge, this is the best substitute we have found. You
  can add wet bean cheese for a sharper flavor. Braise Pork: Slice pork butt
  across the grain into strips, 1" by 3" by 1/2" thick. Heat peanut oil in
  wok until it begins to smoke.  Add some of pork to hot oil; stir-fry pieces
  until they lose their pinkness; repeat in batches until all pork is
  browned.  Next, add garlic to wok; stir briefly. Pour in wine lees paste,
  rice vinegar, sherry and stock; bring to slow boil; add pork slices. Reduce
  heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove pork, without sauce, to
  large platter.  Cool pork.  Cooling is essential so that it will deep-fry
  properly.  Reserve sauce in small pan. You can hold pork for several hours,
  if you wish to braise it in advance. Deep-fry Pork: Heat deep-frying oil in
  wok.  While oil is heating, beat egg yolks with water; set out bread crumbs
  on platter. Dip pork pieces in egg mixture, then bread crumbs, to
  thoroughly cover. When oil is at deep-frying temperature, 375 degrees, slip
  in a slice of pork as a test: pork should lightly brown in about 1 minute.
  Place 6 pork slices on Chinese strainer, and lower into oil, strainer and
  all.  Check in 2 minutes (browning should take slightly longer than test
  because strainer cools the oil).  If you prefer to fry in larger batches,
  use more oil.  Remove fried pork to warm platter, uncovered. Finish: Reheat
  sauce, and pour over pork just before serving. Serves 4

      Title: Asparagus and Sesame Chicken Soup
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 lb Chicken                             2 c  Warm water
      3 tb Sesame oil                          1 ts Sugar
      6    Slices ginger root                1/2 c  Button mushrooms, canned
    1/2 c  Medium sherry                       8    Fresh asparagus spears
    1/2 ts Salt                           
 
  Preparation:  Rinse chicken, remove fat pockets, pat dry, and chop into
  bite-size pieces.  NOTE:  if tempted to use breast meat without bones,
  please don`t; bones add to body and flavor of soup.  Peel and slice ginger
  root.  Wash and cut asparagus into 2" sections. Braising: Heat wok to
  medium hot.  Add sesame oil.  Start braising chicken a few pieces at a time
  when oil begins to smell.  Sesame oil will burn at lower temperature than
  other cooking oils, so avoid hot wok. After browning lightly, return
  chicken pieces to wok; add ginger slices, sherry and salt. When sherry
  boils, add water and sugar. Turn up heat, bring to boil, then reduce heat
  to simmer, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Add mushrooms and asparagus,
  simmer for another 15 minutes. Transfer to covered soup tureen (or put
  plate on top of soup bowl), place in steamer on low, and hold until ready
  to serve. You can make this soup in large sauce pan, if wok is needed for
  something else.  Serves 4

  solids.  Drain oil, reserve. Alternatively, make aromatic oil by steeping
  several peeled garlic cloves in hot cooking oil (after removing it from
  heat).  In small saucepan, heat chicken stock, peanut oil and sugar. When
  it starts to boil, dribble in enough cornstarch paste to give a light body.
  Keep warm until ready to use.  When vegetables are being steamed, reheat
  sauce with chicken oil.  Pour sauce over vegetables. Serve. Serves 4

  the cooked vegetable mixture and the bread crumbs, remove the bay leaves.
  Mix by hand until thoroughly combined. In the center of the pan, shape the

  inches long. Bake uncovered at 350F for 25 minutes, then raise heat to 400F

    3/4 c  Beer                                     Sifted confectioners sugar
 
  Traditionally a dessert, these delicious filled pancakes may also be served
  at brunch.  Combine biscuit mix, egg, beer, and milk, stirring just until
  blended. Batter will be slightly lumpy. Using about 1 TBS batter per
  pancake, cook on a very lightly greased griddle or skillet until lightly
  browned, turning once. Spread with jam and roll up. Sprinkle with
  confectionersU sugar. Serve warm.  Makes 20 small pancakes, about 4-6
  servings.

      Title: Beans with Basil and Chives
 Categories: Vegetables, Side dish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Fresh green beans                 1/4 c  Diced yellow pepper
    1/4 c  Olive oil                         1/2 c  Boiling water
      1    Clove garlic, crushed               1 ts Salt
      1 tb Chopped chives                      2 tb Fresh basil minced
    1/4 c  Diced green pepper                1/2 c  Grated Paremesan cheese
    1/4 c  Diced red pepper               
 
  For this dish, only use the freshest ingredients, and use only fresh herbs.
  If fresh herbs are not available, it simply will not be the same. For a
  nice aesthetic touch, reserve a teaspoon of each color of diced pepper and
  a few pinches of chopped chives. Also save a sprig or two of the fresh
  basil (the centerpiece that looks like a flower of leaves would do nicely).
  When the dish is placed in it's serving dish, sprinkle the peppers, and
  chives over the cheese and top with sprigs of basil.
  ********************************************************************* You
  may use 3/4 cup diced green pepper instead of 1/4 cup of each green, red
  and yellow, or any combination thereof if the yellow and/or the red are not
  available, but they add a touch of color and distinction to the dish. Take
  fresh young beans and remove stem and any strings (the young ones shouldn't
  have much of a string to worry about).  Break them in half (or so the
  segments are a couple of inches long). Heat oil and garlic in a large
  frying pan (make sure it is large enough to hold all the beans). When the
  oil becomes hot, add the peppers and cook slowly for 3 minutes. Add the
  beans, water, salt, basil and chives and turn everything over until the
  herbs and peppers are well distributed over the beans. Cover and simmer
  until the beans have turned a bright green and are al'dente (tender but
  still crisp; which should take about 5 minutes). Mix in 1/4 cup cheese and
  sprinkle 1/4 cup on top.  If you've reserved some of the diced peppers,
  chives and whole basil leaves, garnish the top of the dish with these.

      Title: Sorrel Soup
 Categories: Soups, Side dish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 tb Butter                          3 3/4 c  Vegetable or chicken stock
      1 oz Fresh sorrel leaves                      Salt to taste
      2 tb Heavy cream                    
 
  This is a lovely soup that is quick and easy to make and is a real comfort
  soup. The recipe was given to us by the folks at Bellwether Farms in Fort
  Collins CO (though it has been modified just a tad). It is certainly very
  basic and probably quite old, though no one knows its origin.
  ********************************************************************* The
  original recipe called for light cream. It is likely that what was light
  cream when this recipe was first devised is more like what we now call
  heavy cream. The light cream of the local American grocery store in 1990
  breaks up as if the acid nature of the sorrel is too much for the
  constitution of the cream. Melt butter in a pan. Add sorrel and cook gently
  for 4 to 5 minutes. Add salt. Add cream and cook gently until thick.
  Gradually add the stock and heat slowly. Do not allow to boil.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb New potatoes                        1    Clove garlic (to taste)
      1 md Onion                             1/4 c  Good extra virgin olive oil
      1 oz Fresh dill                               Salt and pepper to taste
 
  Cut the potatoes into 3/4"x3/4"x1/8" pieces. Coarsly dice the onion. Crush
  the garlic and chop the dill fine. Split the oil between two seperate
  frying pans. Slowly fry the potatoes in one and starting it slightly later,
  saute the onions in the other. The potatoes should be just crisp on the
  outside, moist and flufy on the inside and the onions should be clear with
  the edges just starting to turn brown. When both are done, add the garlic
  to the onions, and cook for only 30 seconds or a minute, no more. Add the
  onions and garlic with the fresh dill to the potatoes. Carefully combine
  them so the onions and dill are evenly distributed and the dill just
  'wilts'. Serve immediately.

      1 oz Dill                           
 
  Cut the potatoes into 1 inch cubes and chop the dill. Baste a large baking
  pan with a coating of olive oil. Toss the potatoes and dill with the
  remaining oil and spread them out over the pan. Lay sprigs of rosemary over
  the top of the potatoes covering as evenly as possible. If the sprigs are
  long, break them into shorter segments so the rosemary can be more evenly
  distributed. Bake in an oven at 350*F for 30 to 45 minutes or until the
  potatoes are done. Remove the rosemary and serve in a serving dish
  garnished with fresh rosemary and dill sprigs around the sides.

  Break the garlic heads into cloves, but leave the skins on them for
  protection. With a small knitting needle or small diameter awl (about the
  same diameter as a rosemary needle or a hair smaller) puncture the garlic
  cloves the long way through the middle.  Shove a rosemary needle into the
  center or each one. Baste the garlic cloves and the inside of a small
  baking dish or pan with the olive oil. Bake the rosemary in the oven at
  350*F for 15 minutes or until the garlic is soft inside. Cut the garlic
  cloves in half lengthwise with a serrated knife and use the contents as you

      Title: Carrot, Celery, and Apple Juice with Sorrel
 Categories: Vegetables, Fruits
      Yield: 10 servings
 
      3 lb Of fresh whole carrots              1    Granny Smith apple
      1    Or 2 stalk of celery                3    To 6 sorrel leaves to taste
 
  This juice requires the use of a juice machine such as the Champion, the
  Juice Man, Olympic, or the like. The sorrel adds a nice lemony tartness to
  the drink that helps the celery balance the sweetness of the carrots. For
  the apple, use no other than the Granny Smith, its sour flavor is an
  essential ingredient to this juice.
  ********************************************************************* Clean
  the carrots and remove any green parts. Wash the celery but do not remove
  the leaves. Cut the granny smith apple into 1/8th segments and remove the
  bitter seed pod. Rinse the sorrel leaves. Run everything through the juicer
  starting with the carrots. After one or two carrots have been run through
  the machine put the celery and sorrel through and then alternate carrots
  and apples until they are gone. Strain the juice through a couple layers of
  cheesecloth or a fine strainer to remove the pulp that makes it through the
  juicer screen if desired (this will produce a clear juice devoid of the
  grittyness, that some people do like).

 Categories: Salsa
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3 tb Extra virgin Italian olive               -tomatoes or 1 lb fresh,
           -oil (There is a                         -ripe whole tomatoes peeled
           -difference)                             -and segmented
      2    Cloves of very fresh              1/2 ts Salt
           -garlic, crushed and                5    Very large or 10 medium
           -chopped                                 -basil leaves, fresh and
     14 oz Can San Marzano peeled                   -unbruised
 
  Heat the olive oil over low heat in a heavy, non-reactive saucepan and add
  the chopped garlic and a grind or two (no more) of black pepper. Take care
  that the garlic doesn't brown.  After a minute (no more) add the tomatoes
  and stir with a wooden spoon.  Break up the pulp evenly. Add the salt,
  stir, and let the sauce stew for about  6 - 7 minutes over a gentle heat.
  You don't want to reduce the sauce at all. Wipe, but do not wash, the basil
  leaves.  That may cause discoloration. Add them whole to the sauce and cook
  gently until the tomatoes are soft and the basil has released its flavor.
  Do not overcook. Remove from the heat, allow to cool and remove basil
  leaves. They should be dark and wilted. If you follow these directions
  exactly, and use only the finest ingredients, you will be very pleased with
  this sauce. You may find tomatoes label "San Marzano Style" or "San Marzano
  Type." Ignore anything but "Genuine San Marzano Tomatoes." Don't waste your
  money on imitations.  If you can't find Genuine San Marzano Tomatoes, buy
  Progresso and save your money.  And don't waste your money on out of season
  "fresh" tomatoes from your local supermarket.  They're nothing but insipid
  impostors! If you've never tried Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Italy you're
  in  for a treat. Spend as much as you can afford, and don't substitute
  Greek, Spanish, Portuguese or French oils. They're fine, and they have
  their place, but not in this recipe. And be careful, there are some oils
  with Italian names that are labeled Extra Virgin, but if you read the fine
  print you may discover that the oil is from someplace else and has only
  been packed, or shipped, by a company with an Italian name. For garlic,
  look for large, rounded and well developed cloves on a smooth, unblemished
  head.  Purple colored outside skins are often the most flavorful, but the
  more common white garlic will do.

  3 1/2 lb Tomotillos                        1/2 c  Olive oil

      2 md Onions                         
 
  Roast and peel the green chilies. This may be accomplished in the oven with
  a broiler, or on the barbecue. Turn the chilies often and roast quickly so
  as to loosen the skin in blisters.  When the skin is soft and loose, remove
  by grabbing the edges of the skin between a small knife edge and your
  thumb.  Chop chilies and all other ingredients (raw) to the consistency you
  wish the salsa to be made or perhaps a little coarser. Put all in a kettle
  and bring to a boil stirring constantly as the salsa is thick and will burn
  easily. Turn down heat and simmer for 30 minutes.

  Cover and simmer 10 - 12 minutes. Add potato and carrot to soup. Cover and
  simmer until vegetables are tender, about 10 - 12 minutes. Combine sour
  cream with about 1/2 cup of soup broth in a small bowl, blend until smooth.
  Gradually add sour cream mixture back to soup, stirring constantly. Do not
  let soup return to boil.  Add salt if desired (I don't use any salt in this
  recipe).  Serve by ladling soup into heated bowls. Garnish with dill and
  sour cream.

      Title: Candied Mint Leaves
 Categories: Candies, Desserts, Snacks
      Yield: 10 servings
 
     40    Apple or Pineapple Mint             2    Egg whites (may need more)
           -Leaves (select tender                   Water
           -leaves with no blemishes)               Powdered sugar
 
  The large downy leaves of the apple and pineapple mint leaves take up this
  coating very well which will not readily adhere to most of the varieties of
  the mint. This is a nice confection that has many uses.
  **********************************************************************
   Froth up the egg whites with a little water. With a small brush, paint the
  leaves with the egg white and dust both sides with the powdered sugar. Set
  each leaf on a sheet of wax paper and allow to dry. They will dry with a
  frosty crystalized coating and make a nice garnish for desserts or a
  pleasant candy treat.

      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb White beans (great northern         1 qt Chicken stock or water
           -or navy)                                -(enough to cover beans)
      2 oz Slab bacon, cut into                4    Thighs confit de canard
           -small pieces                            -(see note)
      4 oz Piece of smoked ham                 1 lb Sweet sausages
      1 lg Onion, coarsely chopped           1/2 lb Lamb cut into 1-inch cubes
      2    Cloves garlic, chopped                   (from the leg, neck,
           Bouquet garni (see note)                 -shoulder, or breast)
      3 tb Peeled, seeded, and chopped         1 c  Dry bread crumbs
           -tomatoes (2 medium fresh         1/4 c  Finely chopped fresh parsley
           -or use canned)                     2 tb Melted sweet butter
 
  ****Soak the beans overnight in cold water. Change water and rinse often.
  In a large, heavy saucepan or kettle, combine the beans, bacon, ham, onion,
  garlic, bouquet garni, tomatoes, and enough chicken stock or water to just
  cover the beans. Bring to a boil over moderately high heat. Reduce heat and
  simmer until beans are soft but not mushy, 45 to 60 minutes. (Cooking time
  varies according to variety and age of beans.) ****Brown confit as directed
  on package or until crisp and golden. Cook and brown sausages. Saute lamb
  in a small amount of cooking oil or butter until brown. Drain all meats on
  paper towels. ****In a large, oven-proof casserole, arrange the pieces of
  confit to fit the bottom snugly. Spoon over a layer of beans. Cover with
  lamb and add another layer of beans. Add the sausages and top with the
  remaining beans. ****Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Combine the bread crumbs
  and parsley. Sprinkle over the top. Dribble with melted butter and set in
  the middle of the preheated oven. Cook until top is browned and golden,
  about 30 minutes. Add a cup of water or two around the edges during cooking
  to moisten, if desired. Serve right from the pot while hot. Serves 4 to 6.
  ****Note: Make the bouquet garni of sprigs of fresh thyme and parsley
  tucked inside a thick piece of leek and secured with kitchen string. This
  makes it easy to remove at the end of cooking when all of the flavor has
  been released. An alternative is to tie herbs in a small piece of
  cheesecloth, which can be lifted out. ****Note: Confit de canard is duck
  preserved in its own fat.  While once impossible to find outside France,
  this delicacy is now available in some fancy food stores or by mail order.
  Ambitious cooks might want to try their hand at making their own. The
  somewhat laborious procedure is described in many classic French cookbooks.

  one flat layer over the bottom of the mold. Ladle in the egg mixture to
  fill 3/4 full. Place on a baking sheet in the oven. Cook until filling is
  set and pastry is golden, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove to cool on a wire rack.
  In a small saucepan, gently melt the jelly over moderately low heat.
  Lightly brush filling with jelly while warm to glaze. Let cool completely
  before serving. Serves 8. Note: If green grapes are used, substitute
  apricot jam. Proceed as above but strain before heating.

      Title: Pork with Tarragon Sauce (M_c-Tx)
 Categories: Pork, Meats
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/4 lb *pork tenderloin or 4-6                  -best (use a little more)
           -boneless pork chops or                  -but can use dried
           -backbone                         1/3 c  Canned beef broth undiluted
    1/4 ts *salt                             1/2 c  *whipping cream (or mocha
    1/4 ts Freshly ground pepper                    -mix + 1 teaspoon corn
    1/4 c  Dijon - style mustard                    -starch)
      1 tb Butter or margarine                      *salt and pepper to taste
    1/2 ts Tarragon leaves - fresh is     
 
  *These are in the original recipe, which also uses a 1 1/4 pound pork
  tenderloin. I have modified it by using the chops. We also omit the salt
  and use Mocha Mix or other non-dairy creamer for a "healthier" version (and
  add 1 teaspoon corn starch to thicken) in place of cream. Cut tenderloin or
  chops into 1 inch slices, trimming fat.  Place meat between sheets of waxed
  paper and with side of fist, pound slightly to flatten. Sprinkle with salt
  and pepper and brush with mustard.  Brown in melted butter in heavy skillet
  (slowly), 5 minutes each side until pinkness disappears entirely. Remove
  meat to heated platter and keep warm. Sprinkle tarragon over bottom of pan;
  add beef broth and heat to boiling,whisking to scrape up brownings from
  bottom of pan.  Boil 2 minutes. Add cream. Boil, whisking until reduced and
  thickened.  If using non-dairy creamer, add corn starch to creamer first to
  avoid lumps. Taste and add more salt and pepper, if desired. Pour sauce
  over cooked meat and serve immediately. This recipe came from Debbie
  Campbell, in Chicago, who put together a book of her families and friends'
  favorites.  As we do now, I've tried some low-fat and no-sodium
  modifications for us, and we still love it-- it's fast and very tasty!

      Title: Tips for Making the Perfect Buttermilk Biscuits
 Categories: Breakfast, Breads
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Good recipe for biscuits            1    Light touch with dough
 
  THE PERFECT BUTTERMILK BISCUIT Thanks to Eula Mae Dore, a great Southern
  cook from Avery Plantation, La., I've learned to make the best Buttermilk
  Biscuits I've ever had. Eula Mae says a good biscuit is one of the best
  things to have on hand for quick meals. She uses them in emergencies to
  make simple sandwiches filled with scraps of ham or cheese and serves them
  with pickles and a small salad. For dessert, she warms a biscuit or two and
  makes a shortcake with fresh fruits or berries. She has convinced me that
  you can't have too many biscuits on hand. Eula Mae learned to cook and bake
  from her grandmother, not from cookbooks, and the artfulness of her
  preparation was a joy to watch. Here are some of her biscuit-making tips: +
  First go out and replace your baking powder, unless you bought it within
  the last four months. More baking flops occur from old, tired baking powder
  than from any other cause. And don't rely on the old test of checking the
  freshness of baking powder by putting a spoonful in a glass of water to see
  if it fizzes. Baking powder, like a carbonated drink, can fizz a little and
  still be almost flat. Buying new baking powder costs very little when you
  consider the cost of baking failures. + Next, Eula Mae insists that sifting
  the dry ingredients four times is the reason her biscuits are perfect. I
  tested the recipe sifting and not sifting and, indeed, sifting does make a
  slightly higher, more tender biscuit. + After you cut the biscuit dough,
  put the pieces on a baking sheet upside down. This ensures a taller,
  lighter biscuit by making sure any edges crimped by the pressure of the
  cutting don't interfere with the rise. (The French use the same trick when
  making puff pastry.) + The tip that helped me the most was using less flour
  than usual. Eula Mae's dough was soft and sticky. She handled it gently,
  dusting her hands and the dough with only enough flour to make the dough
  manageable. The result was a lighter biscuit.

      Title: The Perfect Buttermilk Biscuits
 Categories: Breakfast, Breads
      Yield: 8 servings
 
    1/2 c  Shortening                          1 tb Sugar
  2 1/4 c  Flour                             1/2 ts Salt
  2 1/2 ts Baking powder                   1 1/4 c  Buttermilk
    1/2 ts Baking soda                    
 
  Place shortening in small plastic food bag. Flatten shortening between
  plastic sheets so it is thin and return to freezer. This allows shortening
  to become hard enough to break, into tiny pieces when added to dry
  ingredients. Tear 2 pieces wax paper about 15 inches long and place on
  counter, Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and salt onto wax
  paper. Place empty sifter on top of bare sheet of wax paper, lift sheet of
  wax paper holding sifted dry ingredients by sides and pour through sifter,
  sifting onto bare wax paper. Sift back and forth 3 times, then sift once
  more into large mixing bowl. Remove shortening from freezer. Cut into small
  bits, about 1/4-inch square. Drop shortening bits into bowl of dry
  ingredients and, using fingertips, lightly rub shortening and flour
  together, occasionally tossing flour mixture so you touch all particles of
  shortening with flour. When mixture has bits of flour-covered shortening
  throughout, begin adding buttermilk. Using fork, add buttermilk, lightly
  stirring to mix with dry ingredients. Cover board or surface with dusting
  of flour. Gather sticky mass of dough and place on floured surface. Dust
  hands with flour and gently knead dough, adding enough flour only to make
  dough manageable. Pat dough with hands or roll with floured rolling pin
  into round 1/2-inch thick. Using 2-inch cutter, cut out biscuits and place
  touching each other in 3 rows, in center of greased baking sheet. Place on
  middle rack of 425-degree oven and bake 12 minutes, or until lightly
  golden. Remove from oven and serve hot or warm. Makes 19 (2-inch round)
  biscuits.

 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1    Follow directions below        
 
  Using solid shortening generously grease two 8x4 inch loaf pans or one 9
  inch round cake pan. Combine in large mixing bowl:
                                 2 c  unbleached or white flour
                               1/4 c  sugar
                                 1 Tb salt
                                 2 pk active dry yeast
  Heat together until very warm, 120 - 130 f:
                                 1 c  water
                                 1 c  milk
                               1/4 c  cooking oil
  Add liquids to flour mixture, with 1 egg
  ******************** Blend at low speed until moistened; beat 3 minutes at
  medium speed. By hand [unless you have a KitchenAid <g>] stir in 2 cups
  rye flour and 1/2 to 1 cup additional white flour, to form a stiff batter.
  Batter will follow spoon. Cover batter; let rise in warm place (80 to 85
  F) for 30 minutes (batter should not double in size); stir down.  Spoon
  batter into greased pans. Cover; let rise again for 15 minutes (batter
  should not double in size.) Preheat oven to 375 F (350 F for glass or dark
  surfaced non-stick.) Bake at 375 F: 8x4 inch pans for 30 to 40 minutes and
  9 inch round pan for 45 to 50 minutes until loaf sounds hollow when
  tapped. Remove from pan immediately. Cool on rack. Brush top of loaf with
  melted butter, if desired. High altitude (5200 feet): Increase temperature
  25 degrees F; reduce time by 5 minutes.
   Variations: Caraway rye: add 2 tbs caraway seed to dry flour mixture.
   Light pumpernickel: eliminate sugar and decrease water to 3/4 cup; add 1/4
   cup molasses and 2 tbs caraway seed to dry flour mixture.

      Title: The Perfect Pancake
 Categories: Breakfast, Snacks
      Yield: 3 servings
 
      2 ts Baking powder                   1 1/2 c  Milk
      1 ts Sugar                               3 tb Melted vegetable shortening
      1 ts Salt                                     -(margarine can be
  1 1/2 c  Flour                                    -substituted in a pinch)
      2    Eggs                           
 
  Sift baking powder, sugar, salt into a bowl. Add eggs, milk and shortening
  (shortening can melted in microwave at high for approximately 2.5
  minutes). Mix all ingredients and scrape bowl. Heat fry pan or griddle to
  medium high. (Lightly grease pan or griddle with Pam or margarine.) Use
  1/4 cup of batter for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the
  uncooked surface or the edges become dry. Turn pancake until golden brown
  on underside and serve. Option: The amount of milk can be varied to change
  the thickness of the pancakes. However, please note that the batter will
  rise during cooking so experiment by adding more milk as you cook to the
  remaining batter on your first batch.
  *********** The Pancake: There is rarely anything more satisfying than
  good pancakes, possibly because we rely so heavily on egg dishes for
  breakfast. Once you have your basic recipe almost anything can be added
  for any variation under the sun. Chopped apples, berries, nuts, even
  chopped chocolate can grace this simple dish.
  *********** The Problem: Most recipes call for a cooling period in the
  fridge for a number of hours which forces you to pre)predict what the
  family wants for the next day's breakfast or to cut the cooling time and
  produce pancakes the size and texture of bar coasters. Many run to
  Bisquick or Aunt Jemima for a commercial solution. Here is a batter which
  will produce better pancakes in less time, with more fun, to more acclaim,
  at a greatly reduced cost.

      Title: Sour Dough Waffles or Pancakes
 Categories: Breakfast
      Yield: 4 servings
 
-------------------------------WAFFLE STARTER-------------------------------
      1 c  Sourdough starter                 1/4 lb Butter, melted
  1 1/2 c  Milk, warmed                        1 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Graham flour (they come out         1 c  Flour
           -just fine using all white          1 ts Sugar
           -flour too)                   

------------------------------WAFFLE FINISHER------------------------------
      2    Eggs beaten                       1/4 ts Baking soda
 
  The night before breakfast, combine Waffle Starter ingredients in non-
  reactive bowl such as wood or plastic and  mix with wooden spoon. Beat
  until smooth. Use a large bowl as this will double in size. Cover with
  plastic  wrap. Replenish starter with a cup of water and a cup of flour.
  Cover starter. Allow both to sit overnight at room  temperature. To make
  waffles the next morning: Preheat oven on very low temp. Warm the waffle
  iron, warm the plates in the oven. Beat eggs and add eggs and baking soda
  to the Waffle Starter. The Waffle Starter should be full of bubbles and
  have a sourdough smell by now. It may have collapsed and look odd. That's
  ok. Lighlty oil or butter the waffle iron when ready and pour in batter. Do
  not spread with a spoon. Let the batter flow to its own height. The batter
  should be neither stiff nor watery. It should pour smoothly and easily.
  Allow these to cook well, until golden brown, just a tad (30 seconds or a
  minute) past when you see the steam stop coming from the waffle maker. They
  will be nice and crisp yet  not crunchy. Delicious!
  ******************************** Hint: The batter will keep a day or two in
  the fridge, well covered. These also freeze well to make the best homemade
  'eggo's type frozen waffles ever! ******************************** For
  pancakes, reduce butter to 4 Tbs, or substitute 1/4 cup corn oil.
  ******************************** As with any sourdough recipe, this lives
  and dies with the sourdough starter. The better the starter the better the
  end result. Still, the first time I made these I knew this was the recipe I
  had been looking for. Our cold Alaskan winters make a nice hot Saturday
  breakfast a warm and cozy start before facing the crackling cold air. These
  are guaranteed to be light and crispy with a flavorful sourdough tang.

      Title: Tips for Making Yeast Products (Bread, Rolls, Etc.)
 Categories: Breads, Misc
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1    Recipe hint                    
 
  1. Choose a quick rising dry yeast. This will speed up the dough making
    process.
  2. Make sure yeast is fresh. Store in a cool dry place.
  3. Start with all ingredients at room temperature. Cold ingredients will
    make rising time very long.
  4. Heat milk or water only to proper temperature (110-115 deg f if
    dissolving dry yeast in liquid, or 120-130 deg f if mixing dry yeast with
    flour).
  5. Follow one of the mixing methods (premix yeast with liquid, 1/4 cup
    liquid for each 1/4 oz. pkg yeast) or (mix dry yeast with flour and mix
    with liquid).
  6. Always check temperature of liquid with thermometer, bakers who guess
    often play it safe and use liquid that is too cool.
  7. Choose a warm place to let yeast products rise. Cover dough and let
    rise in oven. (warm oven first by turning it on to lowest temperature for
    one minute. Turn off and place covered dough in warm oven).

      Title: Lean Cooking Tips for Beef
 Categories: Beef, Lowcal, Lowfat, Misc, Hints
      Yield: 1 hints
 
      1    See below                      
 
  1. Select lean cuts of beef.
  2. Choose closely trimmed CHOICE or SELECT grade beef cuts.
  3. Trim any visable fat from meat before cooking, and trim inside
  separable fat after cooking, but before eating. Research shows that when
  beef is cooked with outside fat on, some of the fat liquifies and migrates
  to the meat. On the average an additional 9 percent reduction in fat can
  be achieved by trimming before cooking.
  4. Use cooking methods which do not require additional fat (non-stick
  skillets, broiling, roasting on a rack, grilling and ETC.
  5. Reduce oil called for in marinades to 1 teaspoon per 1/2 cup marinade
  or eliminate completely.

  and shortening in a small sauce pan and warm until shortening melts. Cool
  to lukewarm. Pour yeast mixture into a mixing bowl; add milk mixture and 2
  cups flour. Beat briskly until well mixed. Add remaining flour and mix
  well. Cover the bowl and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size.
  Turn dough out onto floured surface. Dough will be soft but managable. Pat
  the dough into a circle about 1/2 inch thick. Cut doughnuts out with a
  three inch doughnut cutter. Place doughnuts on a greased baking sheet and
  let rise, uncovered for about 20 minutes. (Doughnuts do not spread much,
  you can place them about 1 inch apart on baking sheet). Preheat oven to
  450 deg f. Bake about 10 minutes or until lightly golden. Remove from oven
  and brush with melted butter. Sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar mix.
  Variation:Instead of cinnamon-sugar mix, let doughnuts cool after brushing
  with butter. When cool dip in glaze made with powdered sugar and milk.
  Makes about 30 doughnuts. Each doughnut = 125 cal, 3.9 g fat. (28.5 %

  side of peppered steak with half the mixture. If cooking steak over coals
  cover salt side with a wet cloth or paper towels and place salt side down
  on grill.(Cloth or paper holds the salt in place;will char as the steak
  cooks, but this does not affect the taste.) Cover top side with remaining
  salt mixture and another piece of wet cloth or papper towel. If broiling,
  put salt side up, 3 in. from heat. Put salt on other side of steak when it
  is turned. Cook 15 mins. on each side for rare, 25 mins. for med. rare.
  Remove salt before eating.

  chicken pieces pieces with the garlic and place them in a deep china or
  earthenware bowl.  Combine marinade ingredients and the garlic clove and
  pour over chicken.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate the chicken. Turn
  chicken pieces occasionally. When ready to cook, preheat the broiler to its

  and simmer until beginning to thicken, about 1 minute.  Mix in 1/2 cup
  Romano cheese and chopped fresh basil. Meanwhile, cook fettuccine in large
  pot of boiling salted water until just tender but still firm to bite,
  stirring occasionally. Drain well.  Return to hot pot. Add sauce and stir
  to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately, passing additional
  cheese separately. *** My notes:  When I made this, I used 1 cup whipping
  cream, 1/2 cup each Parmesan and Romano, 1 tbsp dried basil, and
  substituted 4 or 5 thin slices of Prosciutto for the bacon- frying slightly
  in butter. I used about 6 ounces of "Pesto Linguini", which is a thinner
  pasta containing basil. We like LOTS of sauce! Source: Stephanie Dicamillo-

      Title: Meatballs (Same Day)
 Categories: Italian, Beef
      Yield: 15 servings
 
      1 lb Ground chuck                        1 lb Ground pork
      3 ea While, smilin' eggs             1 1/2 c  Bread crumbs*
    1/2 c  Parmesan cheese; grated             4 ea To 6 garlic cloves*
      1 x  Salt and pepper to taste            1 x  Fresh Basil leaves***
 
  * Or enough to hold the mixture together. Try to use leftover French or
  Italian bread, and whole wheat crumbs work well also. ** Chopped very fine
  *** If you have them on hand (GrandMa Rose always adds fresh basil) YIELD:
  15-18 medium meatballs, or 40-45 tiny meatballs. Combine all the
  ingredients in a large bowl. Toss gently with your hands until the meat has
  become thoroughly blended with all the seasonings.
   The mixture should be farily moist. 2.  To form the meatballs, wet your
  hands in a small bowl of lukewarm water and then pick up about 1/3 cup of
  the meatball mixture. Roll it in the palm of your hands to form a smooth
  ball about 1 inch in diameter. 3.  Drop the meatballs directly into your
  basic tomato sauce recipe. Or, if you prefer a crusty meatball, fry in
  approximately 3 tablespoons of olive oil on med heat for about 5 min,
  turning to brown evenly.  Then drop them into gently boiling tomato sauce
  as they are browned. Meatballs take about 20 min to cook well. (Remember to
  scrape the bottom of skillet and pour meat particles into sauce.)

  want to cut down on cooking time. When beans start to simmer add ham bone,
  salt pork or bacon. Add more water as needed but only hot or boiling
  wnater. Never add cold water the beans will turn dark. If you cook without
  a lid the beans will also turn a dark color. When the skins are almost as
  tender as the inside of the beans, they are done. They should not be
  broken. Add salt and allow to stand before serving.

  mixture to rise over night. Flour a bake-board and take out large spoonfuls
  of the dough to which just enough flour has been added to permit it to be
  rolled into flat cakes. Spread on well-greased pie tins and when light
  (about 1-1/2 hours) brush melted butter over the top and strew thickly with
  brown sugar. If preferred, spread "rivels" on top by combining 1/2 cup
  sugar, 1/2 cup flour, and 2 Tbsp butter. Crumble together and sprinkle on
  top of cakes. Bake at 400-F about 20 minutes.

    1/8 lb Pepper                         
 
  *** The "recipe" specifies ham from corn-fed hogs, and "fine salt (best
  quality)". Since kosher salt is commonly available today, and contains no
  iodine, I changed the ingredients to specify it.
  Mix thoroughly the salt peter, 1 pint salt and brown sugar and rub over the
  hams and let stand for 24 hours. Then rub the meat with the pepper and part
  of the remaining salt. Let stand for 5 days and then rub meat again with
  fine salt. Set aside for 30 days, hang the meat up and brush off the salt.
  Have hams smoked at a good smoke house, smoking them for 10 days with wood.
  When finished, rub entire ham with red pepper, wrap carefully in brown
  paper and then in muslin bags and hang up with the hock down. Hams prepared
  in this manner will keep indefinitely, and flavor and quality improve with
  time.

  Add salt to the flour, then rub flour and shortening together, using hands
  or a pastry blender. Add enough cold water to make a dry paste. Roll out
  and fit in pit pan. Don't stretch pastry when fitting into pan, as this

      Title: Pumpkin Pie 2
 Categories: Penndutch, Pies
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 c  Pumpkin, cooked                     4 ea Egg
      1 c  Sugar                             1/2 ts Cinnamon
      1 tb Cornstarch                          1 c  Whiskey
    1/4 c  Butter                            1/3 c  Cream
      1 x  *pastry                        
 
  Take a large pumpkin, wash, cut in half and place, cut side down, in pan in
  warm oven. Roast until soft, but not mushy. Scrape out the flesh of the
  pumpkin with a spoon or fork. Place into colander and let drain over night
  in a cool place. The next morning, put 2 cups of the pumpkin in a bowl and
  whip thoroughly with a fork until all lumps disappear, but avoid mashing.
  Drain out as much liquid as possible, because the pumpkin should be dry.
  Add the sugar, yolks of eggs, cinnamon and beat for 5 minutes. Quickly add
  the cream, the whiskey and the butter, and mix well. Sprinkle the
  cornstarch over the stiffly beaten whites of eggs and add to the first
  mixture. Pour into a pan about 2 1/2 inches deep which has been lined with
  pie pastry, and bake for one hour at 375-F. Allow pie to become cold before
  using.

      Title: Lovage, Potato & Buttermilk Soup
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  2 1/2 oz Finely chopped onion            1 1/4 pt Chicken or vegetable stock
     10 oz Corsely grated raw potato         1/2 pt Buttermilk, more if desired
           Fresh young lovage leaves      
 
  Put the onion into a heavy-based saucepan.  Add the stock and bring to
  boiling point very slowly so the onion begins to soften a little.
  
  Meanwhile coarsely chop a small handful (5 or so tablespoons) of lovage.
  Add the potato and herbs to the pan and pour on 1/2 pint buttermilk.
  Increase the heat very slightly and bring the mixture to a bare simmer.
  Stir vigorously all the while as the potato starch will thicken the soup,
  which may stick to the pan base.  Half-cover the pan and reduce heat as low
  as possible once again.  Cook very gently indeed, stirring occasionally,
  until the potatoes are perfectly tender.
  
  Whizz the contents of the pan to a smooth puree.  Season with salt and
  pepper and with extra lovage if you like.  Whizz again and thin to taste
  with a little more stock or buttermilk.  Reheat gently or chill thoroughly
  before serving, then garnish with a swirl of buttermilk and a small
  flotilla of chopped fresh lovage.

      Title: Pasta with Pork & Basil
 Categories: Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8 oz Fusilli or other fresh pasta             Fresh basil, parsley, chives
      6 oz Mushrooms                     

-----------------------------FOR THE MEATBALLS-----------------------------
      1 lb Lean freshly minced pork                 Garlic
           Parmesan cheese                   1/2 sm Egg; lightly beaten
           Fresh basil                              A little butter or oil

-------------------------------FOR THE SAUCE-------------------------------
    1/2 oz Butter                            1/2 pt (scant) stock
  1 1/2 tb Plain flour                              Parmesan cheese
    1/4 pt Double cream                             Dijon mustard
 
  Mix all the meatball ingredients thoroughly; I season the meat with 1
  tablespoon grated Parmesan, 2 tablespoons basil and 1 smallish garlic
  clove, as well as salt and pepper.  Flour your hands and shape the mixture
  into about 32 small balls.  Fry in batches in a non-stick pan for 5 minutes
  or more until golden and cooked right through.  Shake the pan frequently so
  the meatballs keep in good shape and cook evenly.  Transfer to a casserole
  and keep hot.
  
      Slice the mushrooms thickly, saute' them well and add them to the
  meatballs.  Then "wash out" the frying pan with the chicken stock.  Make a
  smooth rich sauce with the butter, flour, stock and cream.  Add any juices
  that have collected in the casserole and simmer for several minutes. Away
  from the heat, season with salt and pepper, 2 tablespoons Parmesan and 1
  heaped teaspoon Dijon mustard.  Pour the sauce over the meatballs, cover
  and keep hot in a low oven.  The mixture can be kept hot for some time
  without spoiling, or it can be prepared ahead and reheated close to
  serving.
  
      Boil the pasta until al dente and drain well.  Add it to the casserole
  together with a small handful of fresh herbs -- about 2 tablespoons each
  basil and chives, and 1 of parsley -- and toss gently to mix well. Garnish
  with more basil, and serve with an undressed salad.

      Title: Chicken Breasts with Green Coriander (Cilantro)
 Categories: Poultry, Main dish
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2    Boneless chicken breasts            2 tb Best quality olive oil
      1 bn Baby carrots                        1 ts Lemon juice
      1 bn Coriander (cilantro)           
 
  Skin the chicken breasts and dust them with a little salt and pepper.  Lay
  each one on a square of baking parchment, flatten it lightly with the palm
  of your hand and lay a sprig of coriander on top.  Fold the sides of the
  paper over the meat, excluding as much air as possible, and roll up to make
  a neat flat parcel.  Then overwrap carefully with foil to make a waterproof
  package.  Trim and scrub the carrots.  Measure the olive oil into a small
  saucepan and add a seasoning of salt and pepper.  Coarsely chop a
  tablespoon or two of coriander leaves (a little less for beginners, a
  little more for addicts) and reserve separately.  All these preparations
  can be done well ahead.
  
      About 20 minutes before you plan to serve the dish, start cooking.
  Steam the baby carrots.  Drop the chicken parcels, seam side up, into a
  large pan of boiling water and cook for 13 to 18 minutes depending on the
  size of the breasts.  Barely a bubble should disturb the surface of the
  liquid while the chicken cooks.  Transfer the parcels, still wrapped up, to
  a low oven for 5 minutes to let the meat set.
  
      Blot the carrots dry and arrange them on a warmed serving dish.  Warm
  the olive oil.  Unwrap the chicken and add just 1 to 2 tablespoons of the
  juices to the pan of warming olive oil.  Quickly carve the breasts into
  thin slices and arrange the meat beside the carrots.  Add the lemon juice
  to the hot olive oil and immediately pour the sizzling mixture over the
  chicken and carrots.  Scatter with chopped coriander and serve straightway
  with hot crusty bread to mop up the juices.

      Title: New Potatoes with Salami & Sorrel
 Categories: Salads, Main dish
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 lb Small new potatoes                       Coriander seed
      1 sm Handful of sorrel                        Wholegrain mustard
      2 oz Italian salami (or more)                 Olive oil
           -- thinly sliced                         White wine vinegar
      1 sm Onion                          
 
  Chop the onion roughly and partially soften it in 2 generous tablespoons of
  the oil.  Do not let it brown.  Scrub the potatoes (but on no account peel
  them) and steam them.  Wash and dry the sorrel, discarding tough stalks.
  Roll up the leaves tighly in your fingers, just a few at a time, as though
  making a cigarette, and snip across into fine ribbons.
  
      Tip the softened onion and its juices into a big bowl.  Stir in 1/2
  teaspoon each vinegar and mustard, some salt and lots of pepper and
  coriander seed.  The coriander seed should be freshly toasted and ground
  coarsely using a pestle and mortar or a spare peppermil.  Add the potatoes
  to the bowl while still piping hot, so they drink up the flavours of the
  dressing.  Cut each potato in half or into quarters depending on size, and
  toss gently.  Scatter some of the sorrel over the base of a shallow serving
  dish.  Pile the potatoes into the centre, encircle them with the sliced
  salami and scatter the remaining ribbons of sorrel over the top. Serve
  while potatoes are still warm.

      Title: Salmon Steaks in Herb Blankets
 Categories: Fish, Main dish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Salmon steaks, 3/4" thick                Fresh parsley, chives, mint,
      4 oz Butter                                   Lemon thyme and tarragon
      1    Lemon                                    -- (or herbs of your choice)
 
  Choose a gratin or baking dish which will take the steaks side by side and
  use some of the butter to grease it thickly.  Put the fish into it and
  season with a squeeze of lemon, a generous grinding of black pepper and a
  little salt.  Cover and set aside in a cool place until ready to cook.
  
      To cook, simply dot the fish with the remaining butter, cover with foil
  and bake at 375-400 F (190-200 C) gas mark 5-6 for 20 to 25 minutes until
  the fish is hot and tender.  While it cooks, chop coarsely and mix together
  heady handfuls of aromatic herbs.  I would probably use something like 8
  tablespoons parsley, 6 of chives, 4 of mint and no more than 2 teaspoons
  each of lemon thyme and tarragon.  You may prefer to use a little dill or
  fennel in place of tarragon, or to concoct some quite different cocktail of
  your own.
  
      Scatter nearly half the herbs on a warm serving dish and lay the fish
  steaks on a bed of herbs.  Scatter more herbs over the fish, spoon on the
  buttery cooking juices then the remaining herbs.  Serve with wedges of
  lemon and steamed new potatoes.  (Other vegetables are best served as a
  separate course.)

      Title: Herbolace Pie
 Categories: Main dish, Vegetables, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Shortcrust pastry                   4    Eggs
           -- (see note)                       2 tb Milk (or more)
      6 oz Curd cheese                              Fresh mint, parsley & chives
      4 oz Cottage cheese                           Beaten egg to glaze
      2 oz (generous) mature cheddar      
 
  *Note: Shortcrust pastry should be made with 8 oz flour, preferably whole
  wheat.
  
  Sieve both the soft cheeses to make a smooth mixture.  Beat in about 2
  tablespoons each coarsley chopped parsley, mint and chives to make a
  prettily green-flecked mixture.  Add salt, pepper and the milk.
  
     Use half the pastry to line a pie plate measuring about 8 1/2 inches
  across the top.  Put the cheese mixture into it, make four hollows with the
  back of a spoon and break an egg into each.  Season the eggs with a pinch
  of salt, a good grinding of pepper and scatter more herbs over the top--at
  least 3 tablespoons of mint and perhaps 1 of chives.
  
      Cover with remaining pastry.  Seal, flute, glaze and make a few steam
  slits in the usual way.  Bake on a preheated baking sheet at 425 F (220 C)
  gas mark 7 for 25 minutes, then at 375 F (190 C) gas mark 6 for 15 minutes.
  Cool for 5-10 minutes before serving with a tomato salad or a green salad.

      Title: Beekeeper's Cabbage
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Red cabbage (1-1/2 to 2 lbs)      1/2 oz Butter
      1    Onion                               2 tb Fruit vinegar (or more)
      1    Parsnip                                  -- preferably raspberry
      1 lg Apple                                    Caraway seeds
      1 tb Honey                             1/4 pt Yoghurt or sour cream, opt.
 
  Cut cabbage into quarters.  Remove and discard the tough central stalk.
  Shred the cabbage and put it into a large mixing bowl.  Peel and finely
  chop the onion and add it to the cabbage.  Cut the parsnip and apple into
  small pieces, peeling them first if you wish, and add them to the bowl.
  Drizzle on the honey.  Add a good seasoning of salt and pepper and scant
  1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds.  Sprinkle on the vinegar , use 3 tablespoons if
  the apple you are using is the dessert variety, just 2 tablespoons if it is
  a cooking apple.  Mix everything together well using your hands -- a little
  messy, but spoons are not as effective -- then pile the mixture into a
  buttered casserole.  Lay a sheet of thickly buttered greaseproof paper
  directly on top of the vegetables and cover the casserole with a well
  fitting lid to prevent drying out.
  
      Cook at 300 F (150 C) gas mark 2 for about 2-1/2 hours until the
  vegetables are beautifully tender, if possible stir the mixture once or
  twice as it cooks.  Remove the greaseproof paper and check seasoning
  immediately before serving.  Serve the vegetable mixture just as it is, or
  top at the last minute with 1/4 pint cold creamy yoghurt or soured cream
  into which you have stirred a few bruised and lightly crushed caraway
  seeds.  Or hand round the bowl of flavoured cream separately, so that those
  who want it can help themselves.

      Title: Aromatic Lamb
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1    Leg of lamb (about 4 lbs)                Olive oil
      3 lb Potatoes (about 5 oz each)               Butter
           Lemon (may be doubled)                   Rosemary, thyme & oregano
           Honey                          
 
  Put the leg of lamb into a large roasting pan.  Bruise the leaves of 2 or 3
  sprigs of rosemary and sprinkle them over the meat.  Add plenty of pepper
  and 1 tablespoon honey.  Rub the mixture into the meat with your hands.
  Then rub half a lemon over the joint, squeezing the juice on to the meat as
  you do so.  Do not add any salt.  Leave to marinate for 4 to 24 hours.
  
      Peel and quarter the potatoes, then arrange them in a single layer
  round the lamb.  Squeeze lemon juice over the potatoes -- use at least half
  a lemon, or up to one and a half lemons for a strong citrus flavour.
  Carefully pour 1/4 pint water into a corner of the roasting pan, then
  sprinkle over the potatoes and lamb about 2 tablespoons chopped fresh
  rosemary, at least 1 teaspoon each fresh chopped thyme and oregano, and
  some salt and pepper.  Drizzle on 1-1/2 teaspoons honey and 1 tablespoon
  olive oil, then dot with 1 oz butter.  Bake at 425 F (220 C) gas mark 6 for
  a further 1 to 1-1/4 hours.  The ingredients will become gilded and will
  burnish to a rich brown in places.  Lift the meat and turn the potatoes
  occasionally, and if necessary, add a little boiling water to the pan to
  prevent drying out.

      Title: Elizabethan Orange Tart
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1    10" shortcrust pastry case               Allspice
           -- thoroughly blind-bakec         1/4 pt Double cream
      2    Thin-skinned oranges              1/4 lb Fromage blanc (or see note)
           Honey and sugar                          -OR- Low-fat soft cheese
           Stick cinnamon                      2 tb Ground almonds
           Ground cinnamon                
 
  Measure 2 tablespoons sugar into a bowl and stir in 4 tablespoons boiling
  water. Add a cinnamon stick and 1/4 pint cold water. Scrub the oranges,
  flute the peel lightly with a citrus zester and slice the fruit thinly,
  discarding the ends. Remove pips (seeds), put the orange slices into the
  sweetened water and leave to soak overnight. Next day, turn the oranges and
  their liquid into a saucepan. Cover and cook very gently for about 30
  minutes. Carefully turn the slices once they cook. Lift the cooked orange
  slices from the pan one at a time, shaking to let the syrup drip back into
  the pan, and put them on a rack to drain and become cold. Remove the
  cinnamon stick, then boil the syrup until reduced to a few sticky
  spoonfuls. Cool slightly then stir in the 1 tablespoon honey. Assemble the
  tart just before serving. First sprinkle the ground almonds over the base
  of the cold pastry shell. Sweeten and flavour the soft cheese by stirring
  into it 1 teaspoon or so of honey and a little each of ground cinnamon and
  allspice. Whip the cream, fold in the sweetened and flavoured cheese, then
  spoon this mixture into the pastry shell. Arrange the orange slices on top,
  overlapping them slightly in decorative circles, and glaze with the gently
  re-warmed syrup.

      Title: Golden Wardens
 Categories: Fruits, Desserts
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6    Pears                                    Honey
      1    Lemon                               8 fl White grape juice
 
  Warden is the old name for the small hard cooking pear that used to grow in
  many country gardens.  The best way to cook them was slowly with honey and
  fruit juice to warm and round out their thin colour and flavour, but this
  recipe works well for dessert pears too.
  
  Choose a casserole or baking dish with just enough room to lay pears head
  to tail in  single layer.  Peel the pears thinly, leaving the stalks on,
  then immediately roll each one in a saucer containing the juice of the
  lemon.  Put the pears into the dish.  Spoon on scant 4 tablespoons honey
  and add any lemon juice remaining in the saucer.  Bring the grape juice to
  simmering point and pour it over the pears.  Cover the dish and bake at
  325-350 F (160-180 C) gas mark 3-4 until the fruit is beautifully tender.
  How long this will take varies enormously - 1 hour is enough for semi-ripe
  dessert pears; 3 hours or more may be needed for pears so hard that they
  seem to be carved from wood.  Baste the pears frequently as they bake and
  turn them occasionally to encourage even cooking.
  
      When the pears are ready, transfer them to a serving dish, standing
  them upright.  Boil the cooking liquid until it turns syrupy and is reduced
  by about half.  Stir in an extra tablespoon or two of honey if you think a
  little more sweetness is desirable but avoid the temptation to make the
  juices too sweet; the appeal of the dish lies in its fruitiness. Spoon the
  syrupy glaze over the pears.  Serve warm or cold.

      Title: Carrots with Ginger and Orange
 Categories: Salads, Vegetables
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb (scant) maincrop carrots            1 sm Bunch of mint
      3 sm Oranges                             1 ts Honey
           Fresh ginger root                   1 ts Lemon juice
      1 sm Garlic clove                             Olive oil
      1 oz Walnut kernals                 
 
  First make the dressing.  Finely grate the zest of 1 orange into a bowl.
  Add its juice, the honey and lemon juice and 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Peel
  1/2 inch or so of ginger and chop it as finely as possible; then crush the
  small garlic clove.  Add both these ingredients to the bowl with a little
  salt and pepper.  Mix well then push 2 sprigs of mint into the liquid.
  
  Scrub and scrape the carrots, or peel them if you insist, then grate them
  coarsely and add to the dressing.  Peel the remaining 2 oranges and cut
  into segments; be ruthless about cutting away all traces of pith and the
  membrane that divides one segment from the next.  Remove pips (seeds) with
  the tip of a knife and add the oranges to the salad bowl.  Mix all the
  ingredients together gently, then cover the salad and set it aside for 2
  hours or a little longer to allow flavours to blend and develop.
  
  Close to serving time, remove and discard the tired sprigs of mint, stir in
  the walnuts and scatter with fresh torn mint leaves.

  casserole.  Sprinke the finely grated orange zest over it and drizzle on 2
  tablespoons of the honey.  Cover and leave in a cool place for 2 hours or
  more until the sweetener has drawn out some of the rhubarb juices; this
  liquid will prevent sticking during cooking.
  
      Cook the rhubarb in the covered dish until perfectly tender - I think
  this is best done in a low oven but you can use a very gentle flame on top
  of the stove if you prefer.  Let the cooked rhubarb cool slightly, then add
  the remaining 2 tablespoons honey and whizz to a very smooth puree in a
  food-processor.
  
      When the puree is quite cold, freeze it in a chilled loaf tin, or other
  suitable container, until firm round the edges.  Beat the half-frozen
  sorbet until slushly.  Whisk the egg whites and fold them in so the mixture
  looks like a pale pink snow.  Cover and freeze until solid. Beat to break
  up ice crystals and to increase bulk, then freeze the sorbet again until
  you are ready to serve it.  Shortbread fingers make a good crunchy
  accompaniment.

      Title: Greenhouse Kebabs
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    Aubergine (eggplant)                6 sm Onions
      1 lg Red or yellow pepper               12 sm Cap mushrooms
      3    Courgettes (baby zucchinis)   

--------------------------------FLAVOURINGS--------------------------------
      4 tb Lemon juice                              Coriander seed,coarse ground
      4 tb Peanut oil                               Coarsely ground black pepper
      2 tb Honey                         

-------------------------------FOR THE SAUCE-------------------------------
  2 1/2 oz Peeled onion                    1 1/2 tb Lemon juice
      2    Garlic cloves                       1 ts Coriander seeds
      5 tb Peanut butter                     3/4 ts Chili powder
      2 tb Peanut oil                          2 ts Anchovy essence
  1 1/2 tb Honey                          
 
  Cut the aubergine and pepper into chunks; cut the onions into wedges; slice
  the courgettes into 1-to 1-1/2-inch lengths; leave the mushrooms whole. Mix
  together all flavouring ingredients.  Toss the vegetables in the
  flavourings and marinate for 2 to 4 hours.
  
     The sauce should be part-prepared well ahead.  Chop the onion and garlic
  roughly, then whizz them in a food-processor or blender with the coriander
  seeds.  Add the chili, oil and anchovy essence and whizz again. Add the
  peanut butter, lemon juice and honey and process once more. Scrape the
  puree into a small saucepan, cover and set aside for at least 1 hour before
  cooking.
  
     Thread the vegetables on to skewers and grill under moderate heat for
  10-15 minutes, basting with the marinade liquid as necessary.  Meanwhile,
  add 5 tablespoons warm water to the pan of sauce and set it over medium
  heat.  Cook at a steady bubble, stirring often, until the sauce is hot and
  aromatic.  Reduce heat to a very low and cook for a few minutes longer,
  adding more water if necessary to achieve a good creamy consistency, and
  adjust seasoning to taste.  Hand round the sauce separately.

      Title: Skewered Fish with Honey-Mustard Sauce
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Firm white fish fillets           1/4 lb Mushrooms
           -- (very thick),                    2 sm Onions (or more)
           -- preferably halibut,              8    Cherry tomatoes
           -- turbot or monkfish               1    Lemon
    1/4 lb Streaky bacon                            Oil

-------------------------------FOR THE SAUCE-------------------------------
      2 ts Honey                           1 1/2 tb Tarragon vinegar
      1    Egg yolk                          1/4 pt Sunflower or safflower oil
      1 tb (rounded) French mustard       
 
      Cut the fish into large cubes, put it into a dish and sprinkle with
  lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Cut the onions into wedges, put them into a
  separate bowl with the mushrooms, add a good grinding of pepper, and oil
  and lemon juice - in the ratio of 2 tablespoons oil to 1 tablespoon lemon.
  Leave to absorb flavours for an hour or more.  Halve the bacon rashers,
  de-rind them, stretch and roll them up loosely.
  
      The sauce can also be made in advance.  Beat the honey, mustard and egg
  yolk together in a small bowl.  Add the vinegar, a spoonful at a time,
  whisking it in with a balloon whisk or fork.  Then add the oil, pouring it
  from a jug in a thin stream and whisking the contents of the bowl all the
  time as you pour.  Continue whisking for about a minute until the sauce is
  a homogeneous thick cream, then season to taste with salt and pepper.
  
      Close to serving time, thread the fish, onions and mushrooms on to
  skewers, adding the bacon rolls and tomatoes here and there.  Grill for 10
  minutes or so under medium-high heat, turning and basting occasionally with
  the marinade liquid.  Serve immediately with a dish of rice and hand round
  the sauce separately.

      Title: Lincolnshire Plum Bread
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Strong white bread flour          1/4 lb Butter; melted
    1/4 oz Easy-blend yeast                    8 tb Milk; warm
      1 ts Ground cinnamon                   1/2 lb Prunes; cut into
      1 ts Ground allspice                          - sultana-size pieces
      4 tb Sugar                               2 oz Currants
      1 pn Salt                                2 oz Sultanas
      2    Eggs; lightly beaten           
 
  Using a food-mixer or processor or your hands, mix and knead all the
  ingredients except the dried fruits to a smooth and elastic dough.  Cover
  and leave to rise until doubled in size - about 1 hour in a warm room.
  
      Knock back the risen dough and knead again briefly, gradually working
  in the dried fruits until evenly distributed.  Divide the dough in two,
  shape and put into two small (1 lb) greased and lined loaf tins.  Cover and
  leave to prove (rise) until puffy and light.
  
      Bake on a preheated baking sheet at 375 F (190 C) gas mark 5 for 40-50
  minutes.  Take the loaves out of the tins and return them to the oven for a
  further 10 minutes or so as necessary - the bread will sound hollow when
  tapped on the base if it is properly cooked.  Makes 2 small loaves.

      Title: Scotch Pancakes
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 8 servings
 
    1/4 lb Plain white household flour         1 oz Caster sugar
      1 ts Bicarbonate of soda                 1    Egg
  1 1/2 ts Cream of tartare                  1/4 pt Milk or cream
 
  Sift the flour with the raising agents and stir in the sugar.  Make a well
  in the centre and break the egg into it.  Whisk the milk into the egg, then
  gradually incorporate the dry ingredients to make a very smooth, thick
  batter.  Alternately, simply mix everything together in a food processor.
  If time permits let the batter stand for 30 minutes before cooking.
      Heat a griddle, bakestone or cast-iron frying pan until very hot - or
  cook direct on the hot plate of an Aga.  Grease your chosen surface lightly
  with buttered paper, using just enough fat to prevent the pancakes from
  sticking.  Using a large metal spoon held point downward, drop a few small
  rounds of batter on to the hot surface.  Space them well apart. Cook over
  steady heat until bubbles rise to the surface and the underside of the
  pancakes are browned - about 2 minutes.  Loosen them gently with a palette
  knife, then flip them over and cook for about 1 minute longer.
  
  Makes about 16 pancakes.

      Title: Wiltshire Lardy Cake
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 lb Strong white bread flour          1/2 oz Melted lard
      1 ts Easy-blend yeast                  1/4 pt Warm water (or milk & water)
    1/2 ts Salt                          

---------------------------------TO FINISH---------------------------------
    1/4 lb Pure pork lard; diced                    Allspice
           Lard for greasing the pan                Demerara sugar
           Cinnamon                      

-------------------------MIX TOGETHER THE FOLLOWING-------------------------
      1 oz Sultanas; chopped                   1 oz Currents; chopped
      1 oz Raisins; chopped                    1 oz Chopped candied peel
 
  Using a food-mixer or processor or your hands, mix and knead the dough.
  Cover it with oiled polythene and leave to rise until doubled in size; this
  will take about 1 hour in a warm place.
  
  Knock back the dough, knead it again briefly and roll out to an oblong. Mix
  together 1-1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon ground allspice and 2
  ounces sugar and sprinkle half of this mixture over the dough.  Add half
  the dried fruits and half the diced lard.  Roll up the dough, like a swiss
  roll, give it a quarter turn and roll it out to an oblong again. Sprinkle
  with sugar and spices, dried fruits and fat exactly as before. Then roll up
  and roll out the dough to an oblong once again, but this time make it the
  right size to fit a shallow baking or roasting tin about 7-inches square.
  Grease the tin and put the dough into it, pressing it well into the
  corners.  Cover and leave to prove (rise) until the dough is light, puffy
  and well risen.
  
  Score the top of the dough with a diamond pattern, brush with melted lard
  and sprinkle on 1 ounce of sugar.  Bake at 425 F (220 C) gas mark 7 until
  cooked to a golden brown and smelling delicious, 35-40 minutes.
  
  Cool the cake briefly in the tin so that the melted fat is re-absorbed,
  then serve it while still warm, cut into large sticky fingers.   Makes 1
  cake

      Title: Devonshire Splits
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 8 servings
 
    1/2 lb Stong white bread flour             1 tb Sugar
      1 ts Easy-blend yeast                    1 oz Butter; melted
    1/2 ts Salt                              1/4 pt Milk; warmed

           Clotted cream                  
 
  Using a food-processor, a food mixer with a dough hook, or your hands, mix
  the dry ingredients, add the warm milk and melted butter and mix and knead
  to a smooth elastic dough.  Cover with lightly oiled polythene and leave to
  rise until doubled in size - about 1 hour in a warm place.
  
      Knock back and knead again briefly.  Divide the dough into eight and
  shape into small round buns.  Space them well apart on a greased baking
  tray.  Cover and set aside to prove (rise) until light and puffy - about 20
  minutes.
  
      Bake at 425 F (220 C) gas mark 7 for 15-20 minutes until golden brown.
  Cool, then cut each bun down the middle, from top to bottom but not all the
  way through.  Split open and fill with cream and jam.  Be generous,
  allowing plenty of jam and no less than 1 oz clotted cream per bun.  Then
  dust with icing sugar.  Makes 8 buns.

      Title: Grasmere Gingerbread
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 18 servings
 
      1 lb Fine oatmeal                      1/2 lb Pale muscovado sugar
    1/2 ts Baking powder                     1/2 lb Butter
      4 ts Ground ginger                       2 tb Golden syrup
      1 pn Allspice                       
 
  Line a swiss roll or baking tin measuring about 9 x 13 inches with bakewell
  or greaseproof paper and grease it well.  Stir the dry ingredients
  together.  Melt the butter and syrup over low heat, pour on to the dry
  ingredients and stir well to make a fairly stiff mixture. Spread the
  mixture evenly over the base of the prepared tin and bake at 350 F (180 C)
  gas mark 4 for 25-30 minutes.  Do not be alarmed by the fact that the
  mixture will look a little runny when it emerges from the oven; this is
  normal.  Mark the biscuits into fingers or squares while still warm but
  leave in the tin until completely cold.  Don't make the biscuits very big ~
  they are chewy and very filling.  Good exercise for the jaws and high in
  calories.

      Title: Nier Beurre (Channel Islands Fruit Butter)
 Categories: Fruits, Misc
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 lb Dessert apples                    1/2    Orange
      1 lb Cooking apples                    1/2    Lemon
           Granulated sugar                         Ground cinnamon & allspice
      2 pt Dry cider                      
 
  Fast boil the cider until reduced by half.  Peel, core and slice HALF of
  each sort of apple; add them to the pan, pushing them well down into the
  liquid.  Half-cover the pan and simmer gently until the fruit is soft.
  
      Add the remaining apples, prepared in the same way, together with the
  juice and zest of the citrus fruits.  Half-cover the pan and continue
  simmering until all the fruit is well reduced, pulpy and tender. Stir
  occasionally and crush the fruit down into the pan with a potato masher as
  it cooks.  Measure the pulp and process it to a puree if it is at all
  lumpy.  Add sugar at the rate of 10 oz for every pint of apple pulp, and
  stir in about 1 teaspoon ground allspice.
  
      Simmer, stirring frequently, until most of the moisture has been driven
  off.  The readiness of a fruit butter is judged by its consistency, not by
  set or temperature.  It is ready when it is nearly dry - a spoon drawn
  across the mixture should leave its own impression.  Pot in small, clean,
  warm jars and store in a very cold larder or fridge.  Once jar is opened,
  the contents should be eaten up within 3 or 4 days. Makes enough to fill 4
  or 5 small jars.

      Title: Teisen Mel (Traditional Welsh Honeycake)
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 lb Plain white household flour       1/4 lb Butter
    1/2 ts Baking powder                     1/4 lb Caster sugar
  1 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon                     2 lg Eggs
    1/4 lb Runny honey                         1 tb Milk (or double this amount)
      1 tb Runny honey                    
 
  Sieve the flour, raising agent and spice into a bowl. Lightly grease a tin
  pie plate measuring about 8-1/2-inches across the top.
  
  Cream the butter with 3 oz sugar until creamy and light. Add the egg yolks
  then the 1/4 lb honey, gradually. Gently mix in the flour, then the milk.
  Spread the mixture in the prepared tin, mounding it slightly in the centre,
  and then bake at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6 for about half an hour.
  
  Let the cake rest in its tin for 2 minutes before turning it out on to a
  wire rack. Let it cool for 10 minutes then slide it on to a baking tray and
  brush the top with 1 tablespoon warmed honey - or redcurrant jelly if you
  prefer. Whisk the egg whites and the remaining 1 oz sugar to make a glossy
  meringue mixture. Swirl this over the top of the cake and bake at 325 F
  (160 C) gas mark 3 for about 20 minutes. Serve the cake when it is cold.
  Makes 1 cake.

      Title: Apricot, Orange & Almond Jam
 Categories: Fruits, Misc
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Dried apricots                      2    Lemons
      2 oz Split almonds                   2 1/2 lb Sugar
      3    Oranges                         2 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
 
  Chop the apricots roughly.  Put them into a large bowl, sprinkling the fine
  grated zest of the oranges and the cinnamon between layers. Squeeze the
  juice of the oranges, measure and add enough water to make 3 pints in all.
  Pour the liquids over the fruit and leave to soak overnight in a cool
  place.
  
  Slide the contents of the bowl into a preserving pan and simmer gently
  until the fruit is beautifully tender.  Check the fruit occasionally as it
  cooks and crush it down into the pan with a potato masher.  It may need
  1-1/4 hours to become really soft.
  
  Warm the sugar.  Add it to the pan together with the juice of the lemons
  and the almonds.  Cook gently until the sugar is melted, then fast-boil
  until the saucer test shows that the preserve will set.  Pot, tie down and
  label the preserve in the usual way.  Makes enough to fill 5 jars.

      Title: Welsh Cakes
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 15 servings
 
      1 lb Self-raising flour                  4 oz Sultanas and raisins
      2 oz Butter                              2    Eggs
      4 oz Sugar                             1/3 pt Water
 
  On sale in every Welsh bakery, these are one of the great delights of
  teatime.  The are easy to make.  The Welsh use a flat iron "planc" (a
  griddle) to bake the cakes, which are cooked on top heat like Scotch
  pancakes.  A heavy frying pan will do fine if you don't have a griddle.
  Makes 15-18 cakes.
  
  Rub the fat into the flour and add the fruit and sugar.  Mix the water with
  the eggs and use to make a soft dough just a little firmer than that for
  the scones.  Tip on to a well-floured board and roll out to a thickness of
  1/2-inch.  Cut out circles with a 2-1/2-inch shell-edged cutter.
  
  Heat a planc or heavy iron frying pan - get the heat up into it gently and
  thoroughly, and do not let it overheat.  If the pan is not well-seasoned or
  non-stick, slick it with a little butter or vegetable oil.
  
  Bake the cakes on the pan, turning them once, until well-risen and lightly
  browned.  They will take about 5 minutes each side.  Eat hot or cold, with
  or without salty butter, but always with a cup of piping-hot tea.

      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 oz Fresh ginger                        1 lb Sugar
      2    Lemons                              1 ga Boiling water
      1 ts Cream of tartar                     1 oz Yeast
 
  This home-brew remains a favourite party drink in a Welsh household for
  both adults and children.  You will need eight pint bottles or four quart
  bottles.  They should be of a strong material and have firm caps with metal
  springs to imprison the effervescent liquid - it's more explosive than
  champagne.  Makes 1 gallon.
  
  Roughly crush the ginger root.  Wash and slice the lemons into thick rings.
  Put the ginger, lemon, cream of tartar and sugar in a large bowl. Pour the
  boiling water over.  Stir and leave to cool to blood temperature. Stir in
  the yeast.  Leave to ferment for 24 hours.  Skim off the yeast. Strain and
  bottle the liquid.  Leave for three days before broaching it.

    1/2 pt Cawl stock and milk mixed                Salt and pepper
 
  Wash the joint to remove surface blood.  Put the meat into a large clean
  pan and cover well with water.  Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down,
  cover with lid and simmer for 2 hours. Top up if the water sinks below the
  level of the meat - at the end of the cooking you should have 2 pints of
  liquor.  Leave it to cool, meat and all, and lift off the white hat of
  grease (it makes good dripping after heating gently to drive off the
  water).  Some families like the fat left in.
  
  Prepare the vegetables - scrub, peel and cut them into bite-sized chunks as
  appropriate.  Wash and slice the leeks into 1/2-inch rings.  Then make the
  sauces.
  
  For the MUSTARD AND EGG SAUCE: Melt 1 oz butter in a small pan.  When it
  froths, sprinkle in the flour and fry for a moment until mixture is sandy.
  Stir in the mustard powder and tumeric and immediately whisk in the broth
  and milk.  Whisk till the mixture thickens.  Chop the egg and stir in.
  Finish with the vinegar and beat in the extra ounce of butter.  Taste and
  add salt and pepper.
  
  For the SPICED TOMATO KETCHUP: Chop the tomatoes, skin and chop the onion.
  Put all the ingredients except the optional chili into a lidded saucepan.
  Bring to the boil, turn down the heat, leave to simmer gently for 30
  minutes.  Push the contents of the pan and boil it fiercely for a few
  minutes.  Taste and adjust the seasoning.  Serve either hot or cold. Finish
  with a few slices of deseeded chili if you like it hot.
  
  For the PARSLEY-AND-CHIVE SAUCE: Melt the butter in a small pan, stir in
  the flour and let it cool for a moment.  Whisk in the liquid gradually and
  stir over the heat until the mixture thickens.  Mix in the herbs, taste and
  add salt and pepper.  Reheat the meat in its broth (the cawl).  Remove the
  meat and keep it warm while you cook the root vegetables in the broth. Five
  minutes before you are ready to serve, add the leeks.  While the vegetables
  simmer, plain-boil the potatoes separately.  Stir the chopped parsley into
  the soup just before you bring it to table.
  
  As a second course, serve the meat with the potatoes, and the three sauces.

      Title: Gooseberry Burnt Creams
 Categories: Fruits, Desserts
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 lb Tart green gooseberries           1/2 lb Fromage blanc or quark
      4 oz Caster sugar (or more)                   -OR- creamy Greek yoghurt
      5 oz Granulated sugar                  1/2 pt Double cream
 
  Choose a heavy-based saucepan with a large surface area.  Put the topped
  and tailed gooseberries into it, still moistened by the water in which they
  have been rinsed.  Cover and cook over very low heat until the fruit is
  perfectly tender.  (It does not matter if the berries collapse in cooking
  here as they will be crushed to a pulp for serving.)
  
  Crush the cooked fruit with a potato masher and cook for several minutes
  more, without the lid but just stirring occasionally, until most of the
  juices have evaporated leaving a thick fruit puree.  Add caster sugar to
  taste and stir until melted.  Spoon the puree into 8 individual cocotte
  dishes and leave until cold.
  
  Beat the fromage blanc, quark or yoghurt into the cream until smoothly
  mixed then whisk until fairly stiff.  Spoon the creamy mixture over the
  cold puree and level the tops.  Cover and chill in the freezer for about 45
  minutes until the cream firms up.
  
  Dissolve the granulated sugar in 1 tablespoon warm water in a pan placed
  over low heat.  Then turn the heat up and cook until the sugar carmelises
  to a rich shade of gold.  Quickly pour the burnt sugar evenly over the
  chilled creams and set aside for 20 minutes or so until the caramel sets in
  thin brittle sheets of gold.

      Title: Wiltshire Whitsun Cake
 Categories: Cakes, Desserts
      Yield: 8 servings
 
    3/4 lb Sm. tart green gooseberries         6 oz Butter
      5    Elderflower blossoms*               6 oz Pale muscovado sugar
    1/2 lb Plain wholemeal flour                    Demerara sugar
      2 ts Baking powder                            Flowers & leaves to garnish
      2 lg Eggs                           
 
  *Note: A handful of sweet geranium or lemon balm leaves may be substitued
  for elderflower blossoms if desired.
  
  Top and tail the gooseberries into a mixing bowl.  Add the finely chopped
  leaves or the florets of elderflower carefully stripped from the stalk, and
  stir to mix with the fruit.  Sift the flour and baking powder into a
  separate bowl.  Cut then rub in the butter.  Stir in the muscovado sugar
  then the lightly beaten eggs. Finally, stir in the gooseberries and their
  flavourings.
  
  Grease the base of an 8-inch spring-clip cake tin, line and grease again.
  Turn the cake mixture into it and mound it up in the middle.  Bake at 350 F
  (180 C) gas mark 4 for about 1 1/2 hours.  Unlike most cakes, this one does
  not come away from the sides of the tin when it is cooked.
  
  Cool for a few minutes before unmoulding.  Sprinkle with demerara sugar and
  decorate with fresh elder blossom or sweet geranium or melissa leaves, and
  serve the deliciously moist cake while it is still warm - as a pudding,
  with plenty of cream.

      Title: Muscat Ice
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 8 servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Tart green gooseberries             6 oz Caster sugar
      3    Heads elderflower blossoms*       225 g  Greek strained yoghurt
 
  *Note: You may use 3 OR 4 heads of elderflower blossom.
  
  Put the gooseberries into a heavy-based saucepan or casserole.  The fruit
  should be still damp from rinsing under the tap but there is no point in
  spending time topping and tailing it as it is going to be sieved.  Add the
  florets of elder blossom, stripped from their stalks, and bury them among
  the fruit.  Cover tightly and cook in a low oven until the fruit is tender
  and pulpy - I allow 1 hour or so at 275-300 F (140-150 C) gas mark 1 or 2.
  Or cook over a very gentle flame if preferred.
  
  Add the sugar and stir until it no longer feels gritty.  Then rub the fruit
  and every drop of its sugary juices through a sieve to make a perfectly
  smooth seeless puree.  As soon as it is cold, spoon the pale aromatic puree
  into a chilled loaf tin, cover it and freeze.
  
  About an hour later, when the ice is firm around the edges but still soft
  in the centre, beat it or whizz it in a food-processor until mushy. Gently
  fold in the yoghurt, cover and freeze until solid all the way through.
  
  Then turn out the ice-cream, beat it again to break up any ice crystals and
  transfer it to 8 petit pots de chocolat.  Cover and freeze until about 1
  hour before serving, when the ice-cream should be placed in the fridge to
  "ripen" it.  Amaretti biscuits go very well with this.

      Title: Rhubarb Crumble-Cake
 Categories: Cakes, Desserts, Fruits
      Yield: 10 servings
 
     14 oz Rhubarb, trimmed weight             1    Orange
     10 oz Self-raising flour              1 1/2 oz Chopped hazelnut kernels
      7 oz Butter                            1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
      4 oz Caster sugar                        2 lg Eggs
      3 oz Pale muscovado sugar           
 
  First make the nutty crumble topping.  Sift 4 oz flour into a bowl, and add
  3 oz butter.  Do not rub in the fat but cut it in with a pastry blender or
  a pair of knives used like scissors.  Stir in the muscovado sugar and nuts
  and set aside.
  
  Sift the remaining 6 oz flour and the cinnamon into a separate bowl and
  reserve.  Slice the rhubarb into 1-inch chunks and finely grate the zest of
  the orange over it.  Cream the remaining 1/4 lb butter with the caster
  sugar until pale, creamy and light.  Break up the eggs with a fork and add
  them to the butter mixture a little at a time, alternating with spoonfuls
  of the flour and cinnamon and add 2 tablespoons of orange juice.
  
  Spoon the cake mixture evenly over the base of a 9-inch spring-clip tin
  that has been greased, lined and greased again.  Scatter the rhubarb and
  orange mixture evenly over the top then cover the fruit with the nutty
  crumble mixture.  Bake at 350 F (180 C) gas mark 4 for about 1 1/4 hours.
  
  Leave in a warm draught-free place to cool down slowly after baking and
  wait until the crumble-cake is completely cold before taking it out of the
  tin.  Wait until the next day before eating.

      Title: Rhubarb, Rose, & Strawberry Jam
 Categories: Misc
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 lb Rhubarb, trimmed weight           1/2 lb Highly scented rose petals
      1 lb Small strawberries              1 1/2 lb Sugar
           -- slightly underripe               4 sm Juicy lemons
 
  Rhubarb is an unreliable setter so the inclusion of lemon juice in this
  recipe is essential and I like to play it safe by cooking the lemon pips
  with the fruit in order to extract their pectin.  Slice the rhubarb and
  layer it in a large bowl with the whole hulled strawberries and the sugar.
  Pour on the lemon juice, cover and leave overnight.
  
  Tip the contents of the bowl into a preserving pan.  Add the lemon pips
  tied in a muslin bag and bring gently to a boil.  Boil for 2 minutes then
  tip the contents of the pan back into the bowl.  Cover and leave in a cool
  place over night once more.
  
  Put the rhubarb and strawberry mixture back into the pan.  Pinch out the
  white tips from the bases of the rose petals and add the petals to the pan,
  pushing them well down among the fruit.  Bring to the boil and fast boil
  until setting point is reached, then pot in warm sterilised jars in the
  usual way. Makes enough to fill 6 or 7 jars.

      Title: Boxwallah's Chutney
 Categories: Relishes, Misc
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 lb Rhubarb, trimmed weight             2 ts Curry powder
      1 lb Onions                              6 oz Granulated sugar
    1/2 lb Raisins                           3/4 pt Raspberry vinegar
    1/2 lb Sultanas                                 -OR- red wine vinegar
    1/2 oz Coriander seeds                
 
  Cut the trimmed rhubarb into short lenghths and chop the onions quite
  finely.  Put both ingredients into a large pan and pour on the vinegar.
  Then lightly bruise the whole coriander seeds.  Add the seeds direct to the
  pan if you want to include them in the chutney.  I love their spicy bite
  but some people complain that the seeds stick between their teeth, so you
  may prefer to tie them in a piece of buttermuslin and remove before
  potting.  Bring the contents of the pan slowly to boiling point, cover and
  simmer gently for 20 minutes or so to start softening the onion.
  
  Add the dried fruits, sugar, curry powder and 1 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Stir to
  mix well.  Then continue simmering - this time without a lid - for 1 1/2
  hours or so until the rhubarb has pulped down completely, the flavour is
  mellow, and the colour is rich and the consistency is thick. Stir the
  chutney occasionally as it cooks to prevent sticking, particularly towards
  the end.  Pot in warm sterilised jars and allow to mature for at least one
  month before eating.  The longer you can resist eating this chutney the
  better it seems to taste.

      Title: Mushroom Croustades
 Categories: Vegetables
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      4    Wholemeal cottage loaf rolls        3 oz Butter
      1 lb Small cap mushrooms                 1 sm Garlic clove
    1/4 pt Double cream                             Fresh rosemary
 
  Cut the knobs off the rolls and reserve as lids.  Scoop out most of the
  crumb from the rolls, taking care not to pierce the crusts.  Crush the
  garlic with a pinch of salt, about 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped rosemary and
  a good grinding of black pepper.  Mash these flavourings into 2 1/2 oz
  butter and spread it thickly over the insides of the hollowed-out rolls.
  
  Season the cream generously with salt and pepper, add 1/2 teaspoon fresh
  chopped rosemary and leave in a cool place to infuse.  Slice the mushrooms
  thickly, and heat the oven to 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6.
  
  Sit the rolls on a baking tray and put the lids beside them.  Bake for 10
  minutes until heated through and slightly crisp.  Meanwhile heat a large
  frying pan.  Add 1/2 oz butter (don't be tempted to use more) and, when the
  foam dies down, saute the mushrooms. Cook them, stirring frequently, for
  4-5 minutes to reduce them and intensify their flavour.  Pour on the cream
  and let it bubble up for a few seconds.  Turn and stir the mushrooms for a
  minute or so until every slice is coated with the scant but richly
  flavoured sauce.
  
  Away from the heat, check and adjust seasoning.  Pile the creamy mixture
  into the freshly baked croustades, top with the lids and serve straight
  away with a large green (or tomato) salad on the side.

      Title: Quails on Mushrooms
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6    Plump young quails                       Lemon juice
      6    Big flat mushrooms; plus...              Parsley
      6 oz Mushrooms for the stuffing               Chives
      6 oz Butter                                   Tarragon
      3    Garlic cloves (or more)        
 
  To make the duxelles, first chop the 6 oz mushrooms plus the stalks from
  the big flat mushrooms on which you will sit the quails.  Chop finely,
  using a knife, not a food processor.  Mix in 1 very finely chopped garlic
  clove, about 9 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, 3 tablespoons snipped
  chives and 1 heaped tablespoon fresh tarragon (or a generous 1 1/2 teaspoon
  dried tarragon if fresh is not available).  Cook the mixture in a little
  butter over moderate heat for 3 minutes or so, stirring often. Season well
  with salt, pepper and about 2 teaspoons lemon juice.
  
  Let the duxelles cool before using it to stuff the birds.  Spread it gently
  between the flesh and the skin, all over the breast area, to plump up the
  quails prettily.  Secure the flap of neck skin under each bird with a
  wooden toothpick.  If the skin is torn, put the stuffing into the body
  cavities instead.  Tie up the legs of each bird to keep it neatly shaped.
  
  Make about 5 oz garlic butter and reserve it.  Choose a roasting tin or
  baking dish just large enough to take the 6 flat mushrooms side by side.
  
  When ready to cook, melt a nugget of the garlic butter in the roasting tin.
  Turn the birds in it to coat them with fat, then arrange them, breast down,
  on a rack suspended across the roasting tin.  Bake at 425 F (220 C) gas
  mark 7 for 15 minutes.
  
  Put the mushrooms in the tin, arranging them gill side up, and dot them
  with the rest of the garlic butter.  Put the rack of quails back on top of
  the tin and turn the birds breast side up. Position the birds carefully,
  placing each one above a mushroom so that the meat juices will drip on to
  the mushrooms during cooking.  Bake for 20 minutes or so until the birds
  and mushrooms are perfectly cooked.
  
  Sit the birds on the mushrooms and serve straight away, or cover and keep
  hot at 250 F (120 C) gas mark 1/2 until ready to serve.  Rice, couscous or
  burghul, and crisp peppery watercress go well with this dish.

      Title: Stewed Mushrooms & Queens
 Categories: Appetizers, Seafood
      Yield: 6 servings
 
    1/2 lb Mushrooms                           1 sm Bay leaf
    1/2 lb Queens (bay scallops)                    Fresh parsley
    1/4 pt Milk                            1 1/2 tb Butter
    1/4 pt Single cream or jersey milk     1 1/2 tb Flour
           Tarragon vinegar                         Fried breadcrumbs; -OR-
           Anchovy essence                          Triangles of fried bread
 
  Slice the mushrooms thickly.  Put them into a pan with the cold milk (and
  cream if using).  Three-quarters cover the pan and bring quickly to a fast
  simmer.   Add the bay leaf and a little salt and reduce the heat to very
  low.  Three-quarters cover the pan again and leave to stew gently for 5-6
  minutes.  Strain to separate the liquid from the mushrooms, discard the bay
  leaf and keep the mushrooms warm in a very low oven.
  
  Make a smooth rich sauce with the butter, flour and creamy mushroom cooking
  liquor.  Stir in at least 1/2 teaspoon each tarragon vinegar and anchovy
  essence.  Leave to simmer for 2-3 minutes then season to taste with salt
  and pepper.  Quickly stir in the queens and immediately reduce heat to low.
  Half cover the pan and cook for just 5 minutes.  Stir occasionally during
  this time and be sure to keep the heat very low - only a very occasional
  bubble should break the surface of the sauce or the shellfish may toughen.
  
  Draw the pan away from the heat, quickly stir in the mushrooms and check
  seasoning.  Then turn the contents of the pan into a warmed gratin dish (or
  divide it between warmed scallop shells for an elegant first course).
  Sprinkle with parsley and garnish with fried crumbs or triangles of fried
  bread.  Serve alone as a first course, or as a main course accompanied by
  some green beans and a little rice or a loaf of warm French bread.
  
  Serves 2 as a greedy feast, 3 as a main course, or 6 as an appetizer.

      Title: Filo Mushroom Pies
 Categories: Appetizers
      Yield: 42 servings
 
      1 pk Filo pastry sheets                  2 ts Coriander seeds
    3/4 lb Flat mushrooms (w/o stalks)              - toasted & lightly crushed
    1/2 lb Onions                                   Butter or oil
      7 oz Feta cheese                         2 sm Eggs
      2 ts Whole cumin                    
 
  Chop the onion finely and soften it in a little butter or oil, then fry
  hard until frazzled.  Remove and reserve.  Dice the mushrooms and fry them
  in the fat remaining in the pan; stir and turn them as necessary to drive
  off most of their moisture and to concentrate flavour.  Mix the two
  vegetables together and season with plenty of salt and pepper.  Stir in the
  cumin, coriander and grated cheese.  When cool bind with the beaten eggs.
  
  Unwrap the pastry one sheet at a time.  Keep the rest covered with a damp
  cloth to prevent drying out.  Cut each sheet into strips about 3 x 10
  inches long and brush on one side only with melted butter.  Put one rounded
  metal teaspoonful of the mixture near the short edge of the buttery side of
  the first pastry strip - about 1 inch from the bottom and slightly to the
  left-hand side.  Fold the bottom right-hand corner of the pastry diagonally
  over the filling to make a triangle.  Continue folding the pastry at right
  angles up the whole lenghth of the strip so you end up with a neat little
  triangular parcel.  Make more little pies in the same way until all the
  filling is used up.
  
  To cook, simply brush the pies all over with melted butter or oil, arrange
  them side by side on baking trays and bake at 350-375 F (180-190 C) gas
  mark 4/5 for about 20 minutes, until the pastry is golden and crisp.  It is
  best to turn the pies over after the first 10 minutes and brush with more
  butter or oil.  For even crisper results the pies can be deep-fried.

      Title: Spinach, Mushroom & Anchovy Salad
 Categories: Salads
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     10 oz Spinach                             1    Mozzarella cheese
     10 oz Small cap mushrooms                 6 tb Olive oil
      2 oz Anchovy fillets (canned)           12 sl French bread, 1/2" thick
      2    Lemons                         
 
  Wash and dry the spinach, discard the stalks and put the leaves into a
  shallow salad bowl.  Put the canned anchovies and their oil into a large
  saucepan.  Add the olive oil, warm very gently and crush the anchovies with
  a wooden spoon so they dissolve and disintegrate.  Lightly toast the French
  bread on one side only.  Paint the untoasted side with a little of the
  anchovy oil, then grill until gilded.
  
  Add 2 teaspoons lemon juice and a good grinding of pepper to the anchovy
  mixture remaining in the pan.  Slice the mushrooms thickly and add them to
  the salad bowl.  Pour on the anchovy dressing while still warm (use a
  plastic-bladed spatula to get every last drop formt he pan) and toss
  gently.
  
  Slice the mozzarella and add it to the salad just before serving.  Garnish
  with the toasts or hand round separately, and offer wedges of lemon as
  well.

 Categories: Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 pt Full cream milk                     1    Garlic clove
      2 ts Rennet (or follow instruct.)        1 tb Parsley
    1/2 ts Salt                                2 oz Butter
    1/2 ts Black pepper                   
 
  This is not the usual oat gruel, but a fresh white cheese, naturally
  soured, or turned with rennet.  It needs a little livening - with herbs or
  spark it up with wild garlic.
  
  Heat the milk (100 F, 40 C).  Stir in the rennet.  Leave in a warm place
  until the milk junkets.  Line a sieve with muslin wrung out in boiling
  water. Set over a bowl and let it drain until crumbly.  Work in the
  seasoning, herbs and butter.  Yields 5-6 oz.

      Title: Skirlie with Mushrooms
 Categories: Vegetables, Side dish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8 oz Mushrooms (wild if possible)        1 lb Medium oatmeal
      5 oz Good meat dripping                       Salt and black pepper
      2    Onions                         
 
  Skirlie is only worth making with good drippings from roasted meat.
  Chrissie remembers that sometimes the cook at the big house would dole out,
  to people who wanted it, the wonderful dripping that had been used for the
  umpteen big roasts.  I like skirlie as a kind of risotto, with wild
  chanterelles that grow in profusion all over the island.  The mixture makes
  an excellent stuffing for a boned shoulder of lamb.
  
  Wipe and slice the mushrooms.  Skin and slice the onion thinly.
  
  Fry the mushrooms in 1 oz dripping in a wide frying pan.  Remove them and
  reserve.  Heat the rest of the dripping.  Fry the onion.  When the onions
  are soft but not brown, turn up the heat.
  
  Add the oatmeal, turn it in the drippings and brown a bit.  Throw in the
  mushrooms.  Add salt and black pepper to taste.  Serve hot.

      Title: Highland Oatcakes
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      8 oz Medium oatmeal                    1/2 oz Dripping or lard
      1 ts Salt                                3 tb Hot water (or more)
 
  Sift salt and oatmeal in a roomy bowl.  Put on the gridle or a heavy frying
  pan to heat.  Bring the water to the boil with the fat.  Pour into a well
  in the oatmeal.  Work into a stiff dough and cut in half.  Roll out on a
  floured board to the size of a dinner plate and about 1/8-inch thick. Cut
  into quarters or farles.
  
  Test the gridle's heat by holding your hand over it.  Lay on one of the
  quartered rounds.  When the farles are ready, the surface stops steaming
  and begins to look dry and white.  Turn them and do the other side.  Dry
  off the oatcakes and lightly brown the edges in a hot oven or under the
  grill - they should curl up to the fire to prove that you have made your
  own.

      Title: Poached Salmon with Lobster Butter
 Categories: Seafood, Main dish
      Yield: 12 servings
 
      1    Whole 7-8 lb. salmon                     Salt

-------------------------------FOR THE BUTTER-------------------------------
    1/2    Lemon (juice only)                  4 tb Reduced lobster stock *
      1    Green-black lobster brain OR        6 oz Butter
 
  *Note: Lobster stock should be made from shells and heads, then heavily
  reduced to make 3-4 tablespoons.
  
  Scale, gut and wipe the fish.  Rub the inside cavity with salt.  If you
  have a fish kettle, steam the salmon whole over boiling water for 30-35
  minutes (making sure the water is kept topped up).  Or wrap the fish in
  lightly oiled foil and bake it in the oven for an hour at 325 F (170 C) gas
  mark 3.  Leave it to rest while you make the butter.
  
  Warm the lemon juice in a small basin over a saucepan of simmering water.
  Beat in the nuggets of cold butter, adding more as each one melts.  Do this
  gently - it can split if you overheat it (revive it with a quick splash of
  cold water).  When you have an unctuous smooth sauce like thin cream, sieve
  and whisk in the green goo from the head of the lobster - which immediately
  turns the butter a wonderful orange-pink.
  
  Serve the salmon when it is just cool but still sweet-flavoured and full of
  its own juices, with piping hot baked potatoes and warm lobster butter.

      Title: Lobster Tart
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 4 servings
 
---------------------------------THE PASTRY---------------------------------
      8 oz Flour                               3 oz Cold butter
      3 oz Cold lard                           3 tb Ice-cold water (or more)

--------------------------------THE FILLING--------------------------------
      1    Live lobster *                    1/2 pt Milk
      5    Eggs **                           1/2 pt Single cream
 
  *Note: the lobster should be good and lively.  A "cripple" - that is, one
  with only one claw for which you should pay less - will do fine for this
  dish. ** Leave out one of the egg whites, it is not needed for this recipe.
  
  Make the pastry first.  Sieve the flour with the salt into a roomy bowl.
  Chop the lard and butter into the flour with a sharp knife.  Finish rubbing
  in the fat to flour with the tips of your fingers.  Work in enough ice-cold
  water to give you a ball of soft (but not sticky) dough.  Cover with
  cling-film and leave the dough to rest in a cool place for half an hour or
  so.  Bring a panful of salted water to the boil - enough to swim the
  lobster.  Kill the lobster (or have you fishmonger do so) with a knife
  slipped in behind its head.  Or plunge the creature in the boiling water
  and hold it under with a wooden spoon (lobsters do drown).
  
  Cook the lobster for 3-4 minutes - just long enough to turn the shell
  scarlet and make the lobster easier to skin.  Drain it, sever the head and
  cut in half, taking care to save the greenish black brain (rather like
  liquid seaweed).  This will turn anything into which it is stirred
  wonderful sunny scarlet as it cooks.  Reserve the brain for making lobster
  butter.  Otherwise it can go into the tart filling.
  
  Remove the lobster meat from the body, claws and head (leave out the dark
  intestine which runs right down the body - and the stomach at the top of
  the head).  Slice the body meat into medallions.  Leave the claw meat
  whole.
  
  Bake the tart-case blind (lined with foil weighted with dried beans instead
  of filling) in a medium oven, 375 F (190 C) gas mark 5, for 10 minutes.
  
  Beat the milk, cream and eggs together and season.  Pour the mixture into
  the cooled tart tin.  Arrange the lobster pieces over all.  Bake at 400 F
  (200 C) gas mark 6 for 30 minutes, until the egg-filling is set.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
           Tart pastry                         4    Spring onions
      3 oz Grated cheese*                      4 tb (heaped) chopped parsley
      2 oz Fresh leaf spinach                  5    Eggs (less 1 white)

      1 lg Leek                              1/2 pt Single cream
 
  *Note: Scottish Cheddar is excellent used in this recipe. ** Greens may be
  sorrel, dandelion, nettle tops and/or watercress.
  
  Make the tart as in the Lobster Tart recipe, replacing the lobster with the
  greens, washed and shredded, but not cooked.  Stir in the cheese before
  cooking.

      Title: Hebridean Scotch Broth
 Categories: Soups
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 lb Neck of mutton *                    1 lg Carrot
      3 pt Water                               1 sl White cabbage (1/2")
      1 ts Salt                                1 lg Leek
      3 oz Barley                                   Black pepper
      1 oz Onion                                    Parsley; to finish
      1    Piece Swedish turnip (5 oz)    
 
  *Note: Neck of mutton may be either whole or in chops (use lamb only if you
  have to).
  
  Start to cook this dish the day before serving.  Boil the neck of mutton in
  a large covered pan in 2-1/2 pints lightly salted water for 2 hours (or
  more if the meat needs it).  Skim off all the scum and the excess fat as it
  rises to the surface of the water.
  
  Take out the meet when it is tender.  Put in the barley and leave it
  soaking in the stock overnight.  Next day, bring the stock and barley back
  to the boil.  Prepare and dice all the vegetables except the leeks to the
  stock and cook for another 60 minutes.  Add the leeks, cut into fine rings,
  10 minutes before the end of cooking.
  
  If you want to have the meat in the stew, strip it off the bones, cut into
  small pieces and return it to the soup before reheating thoroughly.
  
  Put a tablespoon of parsley in each plate, and pour in the soup.  If you
  prefer a two-dish meal, serve the meat as a main course afterwards with
  potatoes - Golden Wonder are Chrissie's preferred variety.  Bake the
  potatoes if they are mature.  Or boil them in their jackets if they are
  new.  For really fluffy, floury boiled potatoes, Chrissie cooks hers whole
  and unpeeled (never cut a Golden Wonder) for 12-15 minutes, depending on
  average size.  Then drain out all but a little of the water, lid the pan
  tightly and steam the potatoes for another 10 or 15 minutes, shaking
  regularly, until they are dry and floury in texture.

      Title: Carrageen Pudding with Rhubarb and Rosehip Jelly
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 1/2 pt Milk                                1    Egg
      1    Strip lemon peel                    2    Sticks rhubarb **
    1/2 oz Prepared dried carrageen *          4 tb Rosehip or redcurrant jelly
      1 tb Sugar                          
 
  *Note: Carrageen is a purple-brown or green fronded seaweed common on
  Scottish beaches on the mid-tide line.  It can be used to set and
  delicately flavour a jelly or thicken a soup.  If you gather your own
  fresh, you will need about 2 oz to set a pint of milk.  Dried carrageen is
  available in health-food stores, or Chinese supermarkets in processed form,
  as agar-agar. **Rhubarb sticks should be sliced and lightly poached with
  additional sugar.
  
  Bring the milk to the boil with the lemon rind.  Stir in the carrageen and
  cook for a couple of minutes until the milk thickens enough to coat the
  back of a wooden spoon.  Add sugar.
  
  Allow the mixture to cool until it is at blood temperature (100 F, 40 C).
  Whisk the egg till frothy and then whisk in the warm milk until smooth.
  Pour the mixture through a sieve into a cold-wetted ring-mould.  Then put
  it in the fridge to set - it will only take about 1/2 hour.
  
  Run hot water over the outside of the mould and turn out the jelly.  Fill
  the middle of the ring with a ladleful of rhubarb compote and surround with
  a little scarlet sauce of rosehip or redcurrant jelly melted in a little
  hot water.

      Title: Cloutie Dumpling with Ginger Cream
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 8 servings
 
--------------------------------THE DUMPLING--------------------------------
      1 lb Self-raising flour                       - cored, unpeeled, grated
      6 oz Fresh brown breadcrumbs             1    Carrot; grated
      4 oz Soft brown sugar                    8 oz Currants
      1 ts Mixed spice                         8 oz Sultanas
           A little extra cinnamon             1    Egg
      5 oz Vegetable fat or butter           1/4 pt Milk
      1 tb Black treacle                       1    18" sq. clean cotton sheet
      2    Apples                        

--------------------------------GINGER CREAM--------------------------------
      8 oz Crabbe's Green Ginger Wine        1/4 pt Single cream
      3    Egg yolks                      
 
  Sieve the flour and mix it with the breadcrumbs, brown sugar and spices.
  Melt the butter or vegetable fat gently with the treacle.  Mix the
  breadcrumbs, currants and sultanas.  Beat the egg and milk together and add
  to the dry ingredients, with the grated carrot and apple - use you hands.
  Add more milk if necessary to give a soft mixture which drops easily from
  the spoon.
  
  Put a square of cotton sheet in the pot of boiling water with an upturned
  plate on the bottom.  Take out the scalded cloth, spinkle it with flour and
  put in the dumpling.  Draw up the edges, and tie up firmly with white
  string, leaving enough room for the pudding to expand.  Lower the dumpling
  back into the boiling pan.  Keep water topped up.  Bring back to the boil.
  Boil steadily but gently for 4 hours.  It can be longer but it shouldn't be
  less.
  
  Remove the dumpling and dip it staight in and out of cold water.  Unwrap
  the dumpling on to a serving plate.  The skin will initially be white from
  the flour.  Put the dumpling on its plate in a very low oven to dry off for
  20 minutes, when it will develop a fine, dark glossy skin.
  
  Meanwhile, make the ginger cream.  Beat the wine with the egg yolks over
  hot water until the mixture is thick, white and fluffy.  Stir in 1/4 pint
  single cream.  Serve it in a pretty glass jug, with the hot pudding.
  
  The dumpling cuts wonderfully rich and dark.  Leftover slices are delicious
  fried in butter - lovely with cream for a special tea-time treat.

      Title: Polenta with Tomatoes & Olives
 Categories: Vegetables, Side dish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      8 oz Polenta                             3 oz Stoned olives (optional)

----------------------------FOR THE TOMATO SAUCE----------------------------
  1 1/4 lb (generous) canned tomatoes               Garlic, bay, rosemary, thyme
      1 lg Onion                                    -- (or herbs of your choice)
      1 tb Olive oil                      
 
  Bring 1-3/4 pints salted water to the boil.  Reduce the heat to low and add
  the grain as though you were making porridge: let the polenta trickle
  slowly through your fingers and stir the contents of the pan very
  vigorously all the time to prevent lumps forming.  Cook over the gentlest
  possible heat for about 20 minutes, stirring more or less continuously -
  like porridge and semolina, polenta is a great sticker.   The mixture is
  ready when it begins to come away from the sides of the pan, is perfectly
  smooth and so thick that your wrist aches from stirring.  Away from the
  heat beat in 1 tablespoon oil, the stoned olives if using them, and some
  salt and pepper.  Use the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to grease the interior
  of an 11-12 inch frying pan.  Turn the polenta into the frying pan, pack it
  down smoothly and level the top with an oiled spoon.  Set aside for a
  couple of hours until the polenta is cold and solid.  Loosen it with a
  palette knife, turn it out of the pan and cut into 6-8 wedges.
  
  To make the sauce, chop the onion finely and sweat it in the oil for 10-12
  minutes.  Add the roughly chopped tomatoes and their juices, several cloves
  of finely chopped garlic and a little bouquet of rosemary, bay and thyme,
  or plenty of well-flavoured herbs of your choice.  Let the mixture bubble
  away gently for 40 minutes or so, just stirring occasionally, until reduced
  to a rich and fragrant sauce.  Remove the bouquet of herbs, season with
  salt and pepper and add extra fresh chopped herbs to taste.
  
  Fry the wedges of polenta in very hot olive oil or unsalted butter, or a
  mixture of the two, for 4-5 minutes on each side until lightly crusted and
  heated right through.  Serve piping hot with the garlicky tomato sauce, and
  with a bowl of olives or grated Parmesan if you wish.  In the Veneto
  polenta sometimes accompanies small silvery fried fish, or a dish of
  Fergato alla Veneziana.  Quail or other tiny game birds threaded on to
  skewers and cooked on a spit, or a saute of chicken livers, and grilled
  sausages, are other good choices but polenta can be served on its own just
  as well.

      Title: Oat & Onion Tarts
 Categories: Main dish, British
      Yield: 24 servings
 
-------------------------------FOR THE PASTRY-------------------------------
      5 oz Oat flakes (rolled oats) *      2 1/2 oz Lard
  2 1/2 oz Wholemeal flour                 2 1/2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
  2 1/2 oz Plain white flour                        Paprika & cayenne pepper
  2 1/2 oz Butter                        

------------------------------FOR THE FILLING------------------------------
      1 lb Onions                          2 1/2 oz Cheddar cheese
    1/4 pt Soured cream                        1    Whole egg
  2 1/2 oz Butter                              1    Egg yolk
 
  *Note: Medium oatmeal may be used instead of oat flakes if preferred.
  
  Mix the oats, flours, cheese and a pinch each of salt, paprika and cayenne.
  Cut then rub in the fat, bind with water and leave out to rest.
  
  Peel, quarter and slice the onions wafer thin.  Turn them in melted butter,
  cover and leave to sweat over very gentle heat for 20 minutes or so until
  meltingly tender, just stirring occasionally.
  
  This pastry is rather difficult to handle so it is best to divide it in
  half and roll out in two batches.  Keep the other half covered meanwhile.
  Use the pastry to line little mincepie tins (or individual 4-inch fluted
  flan tins if you prefer).  Don't worry too much if the pastry tears; patch
  it together by pressing it with your fingertips.  Blind bake on a
  pre-heated baking sheet at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6, allowing 12 minutes
  with greaseproof paper and beans, then 12 minutes without the lining.
  
  When the onions are beautifully soft, remove the lid and cook over
  increased heat for several minutes until they are a rich golden brown.
  Season generously with salt and black pepper, add a dash of cayenne and
  paprika and mix well.  Then tip the contents of the pan into a sieve placed
  over a bowl to drain off the buttery juices and to cool the onions
  slightly.  When the pastry cases are cooked, beat the eggs with the soured
  cream, add onions and check seasoning.  Spoon the mixture into the tarts,
  sprinkle the grated cheese on top and bake at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6 for
  20-25 minutes until the filling is deliciously puffed up and golden.

      Title: Barley Broth with Chicken
 Categories: Soups, Poultry
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2 oz Pot barley                        1/4 lb Mushrooms
  2 1/2 pt Good quality chicken stock          2    Chicken livers, if available
      1    Lemon                                    Cold cooked chicken meat *
      1    Fat garlic clove                    5 tb Coarsley chopped parsley
      2    Leeks                               1 sm Knob butter
 
  *Note: The recipe calls for 1-2 chicken livers, if available, and "shreds
  of cold cooked chicken meat, if available".
  
  Grate the zest of the lemon very finely and reserve it.  Put the barley
  into a soup pan, add 1 tablespoon lemon juice and cold chicken stock. Bring
  to the boil, cover and simmer for about 40 minutes until the barley is
  tender with just a hint of bite to the centre of the grain.  Add the
  chicken meat, if used, to the pan towards the end of this time to heat it
  through gently but thoroughly.
  
  When the barley is nearly ready, slice the mushrooms thickly, and slice the
  leeks (tender green parts as well as the white) very thinly indeed so that
  the leaves fall into ribbony shreds.  Cut the chicken livers, if available,
  into 2 to 3 pieces and saute them briefly in the butter until crusty on the
  outside but still pink within.  Fry the mushrooms in the fat remaining in
  the pan then reduce the heat and cook the leeks gently for 2 to 3 minutes,
  just shaking occasionally.  Then add contents of the frying pan to the soup
  pan.  Add the mushrooms and check seasoning.
  
  Put the chicken livers into a warmed soup tureen and crush with a fork to
  make a coarse paste.  Add the finely chopped garlic, the lemon zest and
  most of the parsley.  Pour on the piping hot soup, stir to mix well,
  sprinkle the rest of the parsley on top and serve.
  
  Note: If the soup is not served straight away, but allowed to get cold, the
  barley will go on swelling and softening; when reaheated the dish then
  seems more like a stew than a soup.  I like it this way but you may prefer
  to lift out the grain and cool it down separately from the rest of the
  soup.

      Title: Spinach & Stilton Pancakes
 Categories: Breads, Cheese/eggs
      Yield: 18 servings
 
------------------------------FOR THE PANCAKES------------------------------
      2 oz Buckwheat flour                     2 tb Butter; melted
      2 oz Plain white flour                 1/4 pt Milk
      2    Eggs                              1/4 pt Water

------------------------------FOR THE FILLING------------------------------
      2 lb Fresh spinich                       2 oz Walnut pieces
      1 lg Onion                                    Butter
      3 oz Stilton cheese                      1    Garlic sliver

-------------------------------FOR THE SAUCE-------------------------------
      1 oz Butter                            1/4 pt Double cream
      1 oz Plain white flour                   2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
    1/2 pt Stock                               1 ts (heaped) Dijon mustard
 
  Make a smooth batter with the flours, eggs, milk and water, then stir in
  the cool melted butter for extra richness and to prevent sticking during
  cooking.  Use a 6-inch pan and make thin pancakes in the usual way, but be
  sure to stir the batter vigorously in between making each pancake or all
  the buckwheat flour will sink to the bottom of the mixture.  If preparing
  ahead, cool the pancakes then stack them (interleaved with greaseproof
  paper) and wrap in a foil parcel.
  
  To make the filling, wash and boil or steam the spinach until just tender.
  Chop it and squeeze out all the liquid (save the juices for a soup).  Chop
  the onion finely and sweat it in a knob of butter until it's deliciously
  soft.  Stir in the spinach, season with a little salt, lots of pepper and
  the garlic.  Toast the walnuts and crumbled Stilton into the spinach
  mixture to give it savoury flavour and bite.  Stuff the pancakes with the
  mixture, roll them up neatly and pile them into a lightly buttered gratin
  dish.  Cover with foil and heat through in the oven for 25-30 minutes at
  400 F (200 C) gas mark 6.
  
  Make a smooth rich sauce with the butter, flour, stock (preferably good
  chicken stock) and cream.  Let it simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring once
  or twice, then season with the cheese, mustard and salt and pepper. If the
  sauce is made ahead, reheat it in a double-boiler for serving, then pour it
  over the dish of pancakes just before bringing to table.

      3 oz Barley flakes                       1 tb Garam marsala
      3 oz Wheat flakes                        1 ts Tumeric
      3 oz Peanut kernals                      3 tb Sesame oil
           -- not salted or dry-roast          3 tb Peanut oil
      2 oz Flaked almonds                      1 tb Soy sauce
      2 oz Sunflower seeds                     5 tb Water
 
  Crush the coriander and cumin - lightly.  Mix them with the nuts and seeds
  on two baking trays.  Set the oven to 375 F (190 C) gas mark 5 and put the
  baking trays into the oven while it heats up.  Meanwhile measure the flaked
  grains and mix them together in a large bowl.  Put into a cup the garam
  marsala, tumeric, a good grinding of black pepper, a scrunch of sea salt,
  the soy, both sorts of oil and the water.
  
  When the oven has reached the required temperature, stir the nut and seed
  mixture with the flaked grains.  Beat the spicy oil-and-water mixture with
  a fork to emulsify it, pour it on to the dry ingredients and stir for 2
  minutes.  Spread the mixture out on to the baking trays and bake for 40
  minutes until golden.  Swap the positions of the trays in the oven at least
  once during this time and stir the mixture occasionally to encourage even
  cooking.  Let the mixture become cold and crunchy before storing in an
  airtight jar.  It keeps well for about a month.  Makes enough to fill one
  jar.

      Title: Baked Trout with Yoghurt and Herbs
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      6    6-8 oz trouts                       2 tb Chopped fennel
  7 1/2 fl Greek strained yoghurt              1 ts Fresh chopped thyme
  2 1/2 fl Whipping cream                      1 ts Fresh chopped oregano
      2 tb Fresh chopped parsley               1 ts Fresh chopped tarragon
      2 tb Chopped chives                           Clarified or unsalted butter
 
  Choose a baking dish or other shallow oven-proof dish suitable for bringing
  to table, which is just large enough to take the trout in a single layer
  when they are arranged head to tail.  Thoroughly dry the fish with plenty
  of kitchen paper.  Make a frying pan very hot, barely smear it with fat and
  fry the fish briefly, one or two at a time, just long enough to brown their
  skins well on both sides.  Transfer the fish to the ovenproof dish,
  arranging them neatly.  Cover and store in a cool place.
  
  Chop the herbs and mix them gently in a small saucepan.  Measure the
  yoghurt and cream and pour them over the herbs.  Add plenty of pepper and
  some salt and stir to mix well.  Cover and leave to infuse.  Everything up
  to this stage can be done in advance, but be sure to bring both the pan of
  sauce and the dish of trout back to room temperature about 1 hour before
  they are to be put back into the oven for cooking.  (Foods that are
  transferred straight from the fridge to cooker take a very long time to
  heat through properly.)
  
  About 1/2 hour before you plan to serve the trout, bring the yoghurt-and-
  herb mixture very slowly to simmering point, stirring all the while.  Pour
  the aromatic mixture over the fish, cover the dish and bake at 350 F (180
  C) gas mark 4 for 20-25 minutes until the fish are piping hot and cooked
  through.  (To check a trout for readiness, insert the tip of a knife into
  its flesh just behind the head.)  Serve with steamed new potatoes and other
  young summer vegetables such as carrots and peas.

      Title: Kennet Fried Trout
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      2 sm Trout, (6-8 oz each)                2 oz Unsalted or clarified butter
      2    Rashers streaky bacon               1    Lemon
      1 tb (heaped) coarse oatmeal                  A little plain flour
 
  Rub the skins of the cleaned and dried trout very gently with a good
  grinding of pepper - this makes the rich skin deliciously piquant when
  crisply fried - then dust lightly with flour and salt.  Warm a frying pan
  large enough to take the two fish.  Toast the oatmeal in it, or, for a
  richer dish, fry it.  Remove and reserve.  Cut the bacon into snippets; fry
  gently until the fat runs, then increase heat to crisp the bacon a little.
  Remove and keep hot.  Dice the butter and add 1-1/2 oz of it to the pan.
  When the butter foam dies down add the fish.  Press them down lightly to
  ensure they lie very flat, touching the pan base everywhere. After 4-5
  minutes steady cooking in the bubbling butter, the skin on the underside of
  the fish should be crisp and golden brown.  Turn them carefully and fry on
  the second side in the same way.  Put the cooked fish on to warmed plates,
  scatter the bacon and oatmeal over them and keep hot.
  
  Wipe out the pan with kitchen paper.  Melt the remaining butter and cook to
  a rich shade of gold.  Quickly add generous 1 teaspoon lemon juice and a
  little salt and pepper.  Swirl to mix well, pour over the trout and serve
  immediately with wedges of lemon.

      Title: Riverside Kedgeree
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 lb Cold cooked salmon or trout*        8 oz Brown rice
      1 lg Cucumber                            2 oz Butter
      1 bn Watercress                               A little caster sugar
    1/4 lb Shelled young peas                       A little tarragon vinegar
 
  *Note: Salmon, sea trout or river trout may be used (farmed trout is
  unsuitable - its texture is too soft).
  
  Peel and seed the cucumber and cut the flesh into pieces no larger than
  matchsticks.  Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon each salt and caster sugar and 1
  teaspoon tarragon vinegar.  Toss lightly and set aside for at least 40
  minutes, or all day if you prefer, to draw out some of the cucumber juices.
  Drain well and pat dry.
  
  Cook the rice in double its volume of boiling salted water or, better
  still, in fish stock.  It will take about 35 minutes to become tender.
  Towards the end of this time cook the vegetables.  Boil the peas in a
  little lightly sugared water.  Melt the butter in a flameproof casserole,
  add the sticks of cucumber and cook over medium-low heat for 2 minutes,
  just stirring occasionally.  Break the skinned and boned fish into big
  flaky chunks.  Lay the fish on top of the cucumber - don't stir it in.
  Cover the casserole and reduce heat as low as possible.  Leave to cook,
  just shaking the casserole occasionally, until the cucumber is tender and
  the fish is well heated through - 4 minutes or so.  Meanwhile put the
  watercress into a food-processor and reduce it to green flecks.
  
  To assemble the kedgeree, add the prepared watercress, peas and cooked rice
  to the buttery fish and cucumber mixture.  Immediately draw the casserole
  away from the heat and season it generously with sea salt and freshly
  ground black pepper.  Toss the ingredients gently but thoroughly to mix
  them well and serve straight away with a large fresh green salad, or with a
  tomato salad if you prefer. Serves 4-6.

      Title: Creamy Trout Mousse
 Categories: Appetizers, Main dish, Fish
      Yield: 3 servings
 
      2    Trouts (6 oz ea. cleaned) *     1 1/4 ts Gelatine powder (or more)
      1    Whole egg                                Fresh parsley & tarragon
      1    Egg white                         1/2    Cucumber
    1/4 pt Olive or sunflower oil                   Caster sugar
      5 tb Creamy yoghurt                           Tarragon vinegar
      1 ts Dijon mustard                  
 
  *Note: In lieu of fresh trout, 1/2 lb cooked and flaked fish may be used.
  Serves 6 as an appetizer, or 3 as a light lunch.
  
  If using fresh trout, poach them in the oven at 350 F (180 C) gas mark 4
  for 30 minutes, then cool, skin, bone and flake - there should be about 8
  ounces of cooked flesh.
  
  Separate the egg and use the yolk to make mayonnaise: season it with salt
  and pepper, gradually beat in the oil, then 1 teaspoon or so of vinegar to
  thin and flavour the sauce.
  
  Put the prepared fish into a food processor.  Add the mustard, yoghurt and
  1 heaped teaspoon each fresh chopped tarragon and parsley, and whizz to a
  perfectly smooth puree.  Soak the gelatine (more may be necessary in hot
  weather) in 3 tablespoons cold water, let it soften and swell, then
  dissolve over low heat.  Cool for a minute or two before adding the liquid
  gelatine to the fish puree: pour it on in a thin stream while the machine
  is running.  Carefully and gradually beat the fish puree into the
  mayonnaise.  Quickly whisk the egg whites to snowy peaks and fold them into
  the fish puree.  Taste and adjust the seasoning.  Divide the mixture
  between 6 ramekins or 3 small souffle dishes.  Cover and chill for 2-3
  hours until set to a soft cream.
  
  Seed the cucumber but do not peel.  Chop it finely, sprinkle it with 1/4
  teaspoon each salt and caster sugar and 1/2 teaspoon tarragon vinegar, and
  set aside for a couple of hours to draw out some of the cucumber juices.
  Drain and pat dry.  Top each mousse immediately before serving with a small
  spoonful of the cucumber - a good crunchy contrast to the soft textured
  mousse - and garnish with a tarragon leaf.  Oatcakes that have been gently
  warmed in the oven go well with this dish.

      Title: Spaghetti with Salmon and Sorrel (Or Spinach)
 Categories: Fish, Pasta
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      4 oz Cooked and flaked salmon            8 oz Fresh spaghetti
      1 oz Fresh sorrel (or spinach) *              Lemon juice and butter
      2 oz Broccoli florets                    2 tb Freshly grated Parmesan
 
  *Note: Amount given for sorrel (or spinach) is for trimmed weight.
  
  Take some sorrel or spinach leaves and roll them up tightly, a few at a
  time.  Snip across with scissors to make fine green ribbony shreds.  Chop
  the broccoli florets into very small pieces indeed, and bring a large pan
  of salted water to the boil for cooking the pasta.
  
  Melt 2 oz butter in a flameproof casserole suitable for bringing to table.
  Add the broccoli, stir to coat with fat, cover with a lid and cook gently
  for just 1 minute.  Add a very generous grinding of pepper, some salt and 2
  teaspoons lemon juice (or quite a bit more lemon if using spinach). Shake
  the casserole to distribute the flavourings, then scatter the flaked fish
  over the broccoli but do not stir it in.  Cover and leave over very gentle
  heat for just 3 minutes or so.  Meanwhile cook the pasta.
  
  Draw the casserole away from the heat.  Add the well drained pasta, the
  Parmesan and most of the sorrel or spinach ribbons.  Toss quickly, gently
  and thoroughly so that every strand of pasta is anointed with butter and
  prettily flecked with the pink and green of the salmon and vegetables.
  Check the seasoning, sprinkle the remaining ribbons of greenery over the
  top and serve straight away, accompanied by wedges of lemon instead of the
  ubiquitous bowl of grated Parmesan cheese.

      Title: Scalloped Salmon or Trout
 Categories: Fish, Main dish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    1/2 lb Cold cooked salmon or trout     1 1/2 oz Flour
           - (sea or river trout)            1/2 pt Whole milk
    1/2 lb Florentine fennel                 1/4 pt Fish stock
           - (trimmed weight)                       Lemon juice
    1/2 lb Steaky bacon                             Dijon mustard
      2 oz Butter                                   Toasted or fried breadcrumbs
 
  Serves 8 as an appetizer, or 3-4 as a main course.
  
  Trim the fennel in the usual way, scraping away fibrous threads with a
  potato peeler, or remove and discard the outer layers if they are
  tired-looking or tough.  Chop the flesh into small chunks and toss in 1/2
  oz melted butter.  Half cover the pan and leave to cook gently for 10
  minutes just shaking the pan occasionally.  Add the bacon, cut into
  snippets, increase heat and cook, stirring frequently, for several minutes
  until the bacon is cooked and the fennel is steaked with gold.  Season with
  a good squeeze of lemon and plenty of pepper, and set aside to cool before
  mixing with the fish, which should be broken into large chunks.
  
  Make a sauce with 1-1/2 oz each butter and flour, the milk and the stock,
  and simmer gently, half covered, for about 10 minutes.  Away from the heat,
  season with scant 1 teaspoon mustard, a little salt and plenty of pepper.
  Gently fold in the fish mixture and divide between 8 small scallop shells
  or cocottes or put it all into one large gratin dish. Cover with foil and
  reheat in the oven straight away, or if preparing ahead, set aside in a
  cool place until close to serving time.  If the mixture is cold when it
  goes into the oven, it will probably need 25 minutes or so at 425 F (220 C)
  gas mark 7 to become thoroughly heated through. Stand the dish(es) on a
  pre-heated baking sheet to help speed things up. When thoroughly hot,
  remove the foil and sprinkle the fish mixture generously with freshly
  toasted or fried breadcrumbs immediately before serving.

      Title: Little Parcels of Trout
 Categories: Fish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      3    Trout (8-9 oz ea cleaned wt)    2 1/2 oz Butter
    1/2 lb Courgettes                        1/2    Lemon
    1/2 lb Carrots                                  Fresh mint & chives
    1/4 lb Mangetout peas                 
 
  Cut the courgettes and carrots into matchstick shapes about 1 1/2 inch long
  and less than 1/4 inch wide.  Steam them, and the mangetout, but only
  briefly, not enough to tenderise them fully.  Use kitchen paper to blot
  surface moisture from the partially cooked vegetables and set aside ot
  become cold.
  
  Season the softened butter with sea salt and black pepper.  Beat in 1/2
  teaspoon lemon juice and 1 tablespoon or so each chopped chives and mint.
  Use some of the flavoured butter to grease sheets of greaseproof or
  bakewell paper.
  
  Clean and fillet the trout, remove any little bones and cut the flesh of
  each fish into four long strips.  Lay three strips side by side down the
  centre of each sheet of buttered greaseproof paper.  Dust with sea salt and
  grind some pepper over the fish.  Add a squeeze of lemon butter.  Lay the
  mixed vegetables on top, spreading them thinly and seasoning with salt and
  pepper between layers.  Dot with the rest of the butter and, finely, add a
  sprig or two of mint to each parcel.
  
  To close the parcels, first draw two sides of the paper up over the filling
  and fold into a double pleat on top.  Then "hem" the raw paper edges at the
  sides by turning them over twice, and secure with staples. The parcels
  should be fairly baggy.  Put each parcel on to an oeuf sur le plat dish or
  space them out in large gratin dishes or on baking trays. Chill until about
  1 1/2 hours before cooking, then bring back to room temperature.
  
  To cook, bake at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6 for about 15 minutes.  Let each
  person unwrap his or her parcel at table.  Hand round bowls of new potatoes
  steamed in their skins, plain undressed watercress, and Hollandaise sauce
  so that everyone can help themselves.

      Title: Smoked Mackerel with Nuts, Grapes & Brown Rice
 Categories: Fish, Main dish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 sm Smoked mackerel                   1/2 lb Brown rice
           -OR- smoked trout                        Fresh mint or watercress
  2 1/2 oz Chopped, toasted hazelnuts          2    Lemons
           -OR- walnuts                             A little sunflower oil
      1 lb Seedless grapes                   1/2 pt Creamy yoghurt (or more)
 
  Cook the rice in double its volume of fast boiling salted water.  Refresh
  it and dress it with 3 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 tablespoon oil and plenty
  of salt and pepper.  Stir in the nuts and 5-6 tablespoons chopped mint or
  watercress.  (Watercress is good but mint is even better for this dish.)
  Press the mixture firmly into a lightly oiled ring mould, cover and chill
  for a couple of hours or more.
  
  Close to serving time, halve the grapes and toss them in the juice of half
  a lemon plus scant 1 tablespoon oil.  Add some mint or watercress sprigs.
  Skin, bone and flake the fish and mix it in gently.  Unmould the ring of
  rice, put some of the fish and grape mixture into the centre and garnish
  with sprigs of mint or watercress.  Serve the rest of the fish mixture in a
  separate bowl, and hand round the well-chilled yoghurt in a second bowl.

      Title: Turkish Chicken with Walnut Sauce
 Categories: Poultry
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1    3-1/2 to 4 lb chicken         

----------------------------POACHING FLAVOURINGS----------------------------
      2    Onions; sliced, unpeeled                 A few peppercorns
      1    Bouquet garni                            Coriander seeds
    1/2    Lemon (juice only)            

--------------------------------WALNUT SAUCE--------------------------------
      6 oz Walnut kernels                      1 bn Fresh coriander
  1 1/2 oz Crustless bread                     2 tb Walnut oil
  1 1/2 ts Well-toasted corinader seeds        1 tb Paprika
 
  Put the bird into a pan, add the flavourings and enough hot (not boiling)
  water to cover the thighs.  Poach for 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours until tender.
  Let the bird cool in the pan, then skin and bone it.  Wrap the flesh to
  keep it succulent.  Return the chicken skin and bones to the pan and simmer
  for 2 hours more.  Strain and de-grease.  Reduce to 3/4 pints and cool.
  
  Scald or lightly toast the nuts and rub off the papery thin skins.  Then,
  using a spice or coffee mill, reduce the nuts and coriander seeds to a fine
  powder.  Process in small batches, adding the bread to minumise stickiness.
  Transfer the aromatic powder to a bowl and gradually blend in as much of
  the stock as is needed to make a creamy-textured masking sauce ~ you
  probably won't need it at all.
  
  Cut the meat into small strips.  Put them into a pretty dish, adding some
  of the sauce and a little fresh chopped coriander between layers.  Spoon
  the rest of the sauce over the top to cover the meat completely.  Just
  before serving, stir ther walnut oil into the paprika.  Drizzle the mixture
  over the dish in a decorative red pattern and place a little bouquet of
  fresh coriander in the centre.  Serve with rice and a green salad.

      Title: Love in Disguise
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Pigs' hearts                        2 ts Wine vinegar
      1 sm Onion                                    French mustard
      4 oz Fresh breadcrumbs                  15 oz Canned tomatoes
           Bay leaves                               A little stock
           Parsley                             2 oz Butter
      2    Lemons (zest only)                  1 oz Well-seasoned flour
      1    Egg; beaten with milk                    Few spoonfuls yoghurt (opt.)
      2 tb Milk; to beat with egg         
 
  You may get 2 or 3 large hearts for this weight or several smaller ones.
  Whatever the size, they will be slashed; this is normal.  Wash the hearts
  and trim away waste - fat, membrane, gristle and arteries.  Soak in lightly
  salted water for 10 minutes then rinse, drain and dry well.  Chop the onion
  finely and soften it in 1 oz butter.  Away from the heat stir in the
  breadcrumbs, lemon zest, 4 tablespoons parsley and lots of salt and pepper.
  Bind with the egg and milk.  Use the mixture to stuff the heart cavities,
  and secure the openings with toothpicks or cocktail sticks - there is no
  need to make perfect closures.
  
  Whizz the tomatoes in a blender, stir in the vinegar and add enough stock
  to make up to 1 pint.  Dust the hearts thoroughly with the well-seasoned
  flour.  Melt 1 oz butter in a flameproof casserole, stir in the leftover
  flour and let it brown a little.  Blend in the tomato mixture and make a
  smooth, bubbling hot sauce.  Lay the prepared hearts in the sauce and tuck
  the bay leaves among them.  Cover with greaseproof paper and the lid, and
  cook at 325 F (160 C) gas mark 3 for 1 hour.  Turn the hearts gently and
  continue cooking for 1 to 1-1/2 hours more until meat is beautifully
  tender.
  
  Transfer the hearts to a warmed serving dish.  Stir the mustard into the
  sauce, add salt and pepper to taste - and carefully blend in the yoghurt if
  liked.  Pour the sauce over the hearts, scatter lavishly with chopped
  parsley and serve with boiled potatoes or noodles.

      Title: Pork with Celery & Orange
 Categories: Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
  1 3/4 lb Lean end belly of pork              2    Garlic cloves; crushed
      2    Pig's kidneys, (5 oz each)               Parsley and rosemary
      3 sm Oranges                             1    Bay leaf
      1    Head of celery                           A little yeast extract
      1    Onion                                    Flour and dripping
 
  Halve and core the kidneys.  Soak them in acidulated water for 1 hour then
  drain and dry.  Bone the pork, reserve the rind and cut the flesh (there
  should be at least 1 lb.) into large cubes.  Grate the zest of all 3
  oranges and squeeze the juice from 2.  Measure the juice and add enough
  yeast extract dissolved in hot water to make 8 fl. oz. of liquid in total.
  
  Seal the pork briskly in a little hot fat and transfer to a casserole.
  Slice the kidneys thickly, dust with flour, brown in the hot fat and add to
  the casserole.  Tie together 3 sprigs of rosemary, 6 bruised parsley stalks
  and a bay leaf, and bury the bouquet among the meats.  Roughly chop the
  onion and fry it briefly.  Sprinkle on 1-1/2 tablespoons flour and pour on
  the liquid.  Bring to the boil, stirring, and add to the casserole. Add
  plenty of salt and pepper, the crushed garlic and orange zest. Cut the
  celery into large chunks and add it to the casserole - do not stir it in.
  Lay the pork rind, fat side down, on top of the celery, and put a sheet of
  greaseproof paper over that.  Cover with the lid and cook at 325 F (160 C)
  gas mark 3 for 1-1/2 hours, then at 300 F (150 C) gas mark 2 for a further
  45 minutes.
  
  Remove and discard the paper, rind and bouquet of herbs.  Stir the
  casserole to mix the ingredients and add the flesh of the reserved orange,
  cut into V-shaped segments and ruthlessly stripped of all membrane.  Cover
  with fresh greaseproof paper and the lid; cool quickly and chill overnight.
  
  Remove surface fat and reheat the casserole gently but thoroughly for
  serving.  Check seasoning and garnish with fresh chopped parsley.

      Title: Cottagers' Meatloaf
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 8 servings
 
  1 1/8 lb Lean belly pork *                        Fresh chopped parsley
    3/4 lb Pig's liver                         1    Garlic clove; crushed w/salt
      6 oz Lean green streaky bacon            4 ts Lemon juice
      6 oz Grated carrot                       1 ts Lemon zest
      6 oz Fresh brown breadcrumbs           1/4 ts (generous) dried thyme
      2 sm Onions                            1/4 ts (generous) dried marjoram
      1 lg Green pepper                   
 
  *Note: Weight of pork is after trimming away bones, rind and excess fat.
  
  Mince the meats fairly finely, grate the carrot and chop the onion and
  green pepper very finely.  Mix all the ingredients very thoroughly with
  your hands and season well with salt and pepper.  Fry a small nugget to
  check seasoning and adjust to taste.  Oil a 2 lb loaf tin, line with
  greaseproof paper and oil again.  Pack the mixture into the tin.  Press it
  down well, dome the top of the meat nicely and press 2 or 3 bay leaves on
  top.
  
  Cover the tin with foil.  Stand it in a roasting pan and pour in enough
  boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the loaf tin.  Bake at 350 F
  (180 C) gas mark 4 for 1 hour.  Reduce temperature to 325 F (160 C) gas
  mark 3, remove foil lid and bake for a further 30 minutes.
  
  Cool the cooked meatloaf for 30 minutes, then tilt the tin and pour off the
  juices.  Set aside in a cold place overnight before serving to allow
  flavours to blend and mature.

      Title: Chicken Liver Stroganoff
 Categories: Main dish
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Chicken livers                  1 1/2 oz Unsalted or clarified butter
    1/2 lb Cap mushrooms                     1/2 pt Soured cream
      2    Onions                              3 tb Fairly acid yoghurt
 
  Thoroughly heat a large saute or frying pan.  Add a scant 1/2 oz of the
  butter and tilt so that the fat runs sizzling all over the pan base.  Add
  the mushrooms (whole if small or sliced thickly if large) and saute over
  high heat for 5 minutes.  Remove and keep hot.
  
  Add the rest of the butter to the pan, then the onions which should be
  thinly sliced and pushed into rings.  Cook very gently indeed for 15-20
  minutes until beautifully softened.  Meanwhile stir the yoghurt into the
  soured cream and season very generously with salt and pepper; trim the
  chicken livers and pat them dry with kitchen paper.
  
  Lift the onions out of the pan with a slotted spoon, so all the buttery
  juices drip back into the pan, and keep them hot.  Increase the heat under
  the pan and saute the chicken livers for about 3 minutes so they become
  crusted with brown on the outside, but remain deliciously pink and tender
  within.
  
  Return the mushrooms and onions to the pan and immediately pour on the
  seasoned soured cream.  Let the sauce bubble up and cook for a few minutes
  until it is very hot, slightly reduced and thickened.  Stir gently every
  now and again to encourage the sauce to cling creamily to the meat and
  vegetables.  Check seasoning and serve without delay.  Green beans and
  triangles of fried bread go well with this dish, and I like to accompany it
  with plenty of crusty hot French bread to mop up every luscious drop of
  sauce.  More substantially, you could substitute rice or thin ribbons of
  pasta for the bread.

      Title: Beef with Pickled Walnuts
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 6 servings
 
  2 1/4 lb Stewing steak                       2    Bay leaves
    1/2 lb Ox kidney                           3 tb Beef dripping or olive oil
      4    Onions                          1 1/2 oz Flour
      1 lb Carrots                             1 pt (scant) light stock
      6    Pickled walnuts (or more)      
 
  Prepare the meats in the usual way, removing all traces of fat, gristle and
  membrane, and cut into large chunks.  Cut the onions into one-eighths.
  Scrub or scrape the carrots and cut them into 1/2 to 3/4 inch lengths. Toss
  with the meats, onions and carrots in the flour (which should be
  well-seasoned) and brown and seal, in batches, in sizzling hot frying pan
  barely filmed with dripping or well-flavoured oil.  Transfer to a
  flameproof casserole.  "Wash out" the frying pan with some of the stock and
  add it to the casserole.  Add the rest of the stock, 2 tablespoons juice
  from the jar of pickled walnuts and the bay leaves.  Season with salt and
  pepper and bring to simmering point. Cover and cook at 300 F (150 C) gas
  mark 2 for about 3 hours until the meats are very tender and the gravy is
  deliciously rich.
  
  Add the quartered or sliced walnuts to the beef.  Check the stew for
  seasoning and cook for about 15 minutes more before serving.

      Title: Roman Pie
 Categories: Meats, Pasta, Main dish
      Yield: 8 servings
 
----------------------------FOR THE MEAT LAYERS----------------------------
      1 lb Cooked turkey or chicken *          1 lg Bunch parsley
    1/4 lb Cooked ham                               Lemon juice
    1/4 lb Cooked tongue                            A few black olives
     50 g  Canned anchovy fillets                   Canned consomme **
    3/4 lb Mushrooms                     

----------------------------FOR THE PASTA LAYERS----------------------------
      6 oz Macaroni                            1 oz Plain flour
 12 1/2 fl Milk                                4 oz Cheddar cheese
    1/2 pt Single cream                        1 oz Parmesan cheese
      1 oz Butter                         
 
  *Note: Weight given for turkey or chicken is skinned, boned weight. Goose,
  pheasant and other birds can be used instead.
  
  **Well-flavoured, clear stock and a little gelatine powder may be
  substituted for canned consomme.
  
  Make a smooth, rich sauce with the butter, flour, milk and cream.  Let it
  simmer for about 4 minutes.  Then, away from the heat, stir in the grated
  Cheddar and Parmesan, a seasoning of nutmeg and some salt and pepper - but
  go carefully with the salt in view of the cheeses and salted meats used in
  this dish.  Let the sauce cool while you cook the macaroni in plenty of
  salted water until al dente.  Plunge the pasta in cold water to arrest
  cooking, drain well and stir it into the sauce.
  
  Slice the mushrooms thickly and saute them well in a non-stick pan with no
  fat.  Season them with about 1 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, plenty of pepper
  and a little salt and allow to become cold.  Then cut the turkey meat into
  pieces about the width and half the length of your little finger, and mix
  the poultry and mushrooms together.
  
  Cut the ham, tongue and drained anchovies into strips about the same length
  as the poultry but considerably less wide.  Mix the anchovies, ham and
  tongue with a good quantity of fairly coarsely chopped parsley.
  
  Sprinkle about one third to half of the ham mixture over the base of a
  shallow dish of 4 to 4-1/2 pint capacity.  Cover with half the macaroni
  mixture, then all the turkey mixture, then the rest of the macaroni. Spread
  each layer evenly and press down into the dish with a potato masher before
  adding the next layer.  Cover and chill for 30 minutes.
  
  Arrange the remaining ham mixture on top and scatter the olives to make a
  decorative display of the pink, green and black ingredients.  Press down
  lightly then pour on enough barely melted consomme or cool jellied stock to
  cover.
  
  Cover the dish and refrigerate for a few hours until set.  Better still,
  refrigerate Roman pie overnight to allow flavours to blend and mature, but
  be sure to bring it back to room temperature at least two hours before
  serving.

      Title: Neat's Tongue (To Serve Hot or Cold)
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1    Pickled ox tongue (4-5 lbs.)             Bay leaves
      2    Onions                                   Parsley
      2    Carrots                                  Rosemary
      2    Celery stalks                      12    Black peppercorns

------------------------ALSO, IF SERVING TONGUE COLD------------------------
           A little Madeira                         Gelatine powder
 
  Rinse the tongue and then soak it in plenty of cold water for at least 12
  hours.  Change the water once or more during this time.  Next day choose a
  heavy-based saucepan or flameproof casserole that will hold the tongue
  snugly.  Put the tongue into it, cover with cold water, bring to the boil
  and skim.  Taste the water; if it is very salty, tip it away, add fresh
  water and bring to the boil again.  Add the chopped vegetables, peppercorns
  and a bouquet of bay, parsley and rosemary.  Cover tightly and cook very
  gently on top of the stove or in an oven heated to 300 F (150 C) gas mark 2
  for about 4 hours until the tongue is so tender that a skewer will go
  through the root end like butter.  Lower the temperature as necessary; the
  meat will be best if barely a bubble breaks the surface of the liquid as it
  cooks.  Skin the cooked tongue while it is still hot. Then cut away the fat
  and gristle from the end and remove all small bones if the butcher has not
  already done this.  Skim off all the fat from the cooking liquor and save
  it for the sauce and for soups.
  
  IF THE TONGUE IS TO BE SERVED HOT, carve it in thin slices while it is
  still hot and arrange it prettily, overlapping slices like tiles, on a
  large warmed serving dish.  Pour some good hot sauce over it, cover the
  dish with foil and place in the oven for about 10 minutes to heat through.
  The spiced Kumquat Sauce recipe is one of my favourites and I like to serve
  extra in a sauce boat.
  
  IF THE TONGUE IS TO BE SERVED COLD, mould and glaze it while still warm.
  Curl the tongue to make it fit a small round container with straight sides.
  Traditional tongue-presses usually measure about 5-6 inches in diameter; a
  cake tin or souffle dish of similar size will do just as well.
  
  To glaze, melt 2 teaspoons gelatine powder in 1 tablespoon water, then
  blend in a scant 1/2 pint tongue cooking liquor (seasoned and reduced as
  necessary for good flavour), and give it a little oomph with 1-2
  tablespoons Madeira.  Pour over the tongue as much of the liquid jelly as
  is needed to fill gaps.  Press the tongue down with a saucer or plate which
  fits just inside the tin, weight it down heavily and leave overnight in a
  cold larder until meat and jelly are set.  Chill any left-over jelly
  separately so that it can be diced and used to garnish the tongue when it
  is served.
  
  Unmould the tongue on to a flat dish for serving.  Decorate it and
  accompany it with a fine sauce such as a classic Cumberland sauce or
  Piquant Parsley and Caper Sauce.

      Title: Sauces for Tongue
 Categories: Sauces, Meats
      Yield: 1 servings
 
--------------------------FOR SPICED KUMQUAT SAUCE--------------------------
      5    Kumquats                            1 tb Tarragon vinegar
      3    Bay leaves                        3/4 oz Butter
      9    Whole cloves; bruised               2 tb Flour
    3/4 pt Stock, pref. from tongue                 Salt and pepper
      1 lg Orange (juice only)                 4 tb Thick cream
      2 ts Lemon juice                   

-------------------------FOR PARSLEY & CAPER SAUCE-------------------------
      1    Garlic clove                        1 sm Lemon; juice & zest only
      1 oz Parsely; chopped                    8 fl Oil
    1/2 oz Chives                                   Black pepper
  1 1/2 oz Capers                         
 
  FOR SPICED KUMQUAT SAUCE: Slice and remove the pips from the kumquats. Put
  them into a pan with the bay leaves, cloves, stock, orange juice, lemon
  juice and tarragon vinegar. Bring very slowly to the boil. Add a little
  salt and pepper, cover and set aside for 20 minutes to infuse. Strain,
  reserving the kumquats, liquid and spices separately. Make a smooth sauce
  with the butter, flour and cooking liquid. Return spices to the pan and
  simmer uncovered for 20 minutes. Stir regularly to prevent sticking and to
  stop a skin from forming. By the end of this time, the sauce should be the
  consistency of cream; if necessary boil it hard for 2-3 minutes to reduce
  and thicken it a little. Strain to extract the spices, stir in the cream,
  then the kumquats. Reheat gently, adding a few pinches of ground cloves,
  more lemon juice and other seasonings to taste.
  
  FOR PARSLEY & CAPER SAUCE:  Crush the garlic clove with a little salt. Then
  process it briefly with the chopped parsley, chives and capers.  Add the
  lemon juice and zest, and the oil and whizz again until the mixture is
  reduced to a thickened fragrant green puree.  Add a coarse grinding of
  black pepper and leave it for 1 hour or so to allow the flavours to blend.

      Title: Home-Candied Angelica
 Categories: Candies, Misc
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Angelica                            1 lb Granulated sugar
 
  The most important thing about candying angelica is to choose stalks that
  are young and tender.  In other words, angelica is only worth candying in
  April or May when the shoots are new and softly coloured.  Trim the young
  shoots into 3-4 inch lengths, put them into a pan, cover with water and
  bring to a boil.  Drain and scrape away tough skin and fibrous threads with
  a potato peeler, rather as you might prepare celery.  Return the angelica
  to the pan, pour on fresh boiling water and cook until green and tender. If
  the shoots are as youthful as they should be, this will take 5 minutes or
  less.  Drain the stalks and dry them.  Put them into a bowl and sprinkle
  granulated sugar between layers, allowing 1 pound of sugar for every 1
  pound of angelica.  Cover and leave for 2 to 3 days.  Slide contents of the
  bowl into a heavy-based pan.  Bring very slowly to the boil and simmer
  until the angelica feels perfectly tender and looks clear. Drain, then roll
  or toss the shoots on greaseproof paper thickly strewn with sugar, letting
  the angelica take up as much sugar as will stick to it. Then dry off the
  angelica - without letting it become hard - in the oven, using the lowest
  possible temperature.  I place the stalks directly on the oven shelves
  (with trays underneath to catch any falling sugar) and find they need about
  3 hours.  Wrap and store after cooling completely. Packed into pretty
  little boxes, home-candied angelica makes a charming present.

      Title: Angelica Tartlets
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      2 oz Home-candied angelica             1/2 c  Curd cheese
      1    Shortcrust pastry *                 1    Egg yolk; mixed with:
  1 1/2 oz Butter                              1 ts Milk
  1 1/2 tb Honey                               1    Egg white
 
  *Note: Shortcrust pastry made with 7-8 oz flour will be about right for
  this recipe.
  
  These tarts are irresistible when made with home-candied angelica, as dull
  as ditchwater when store-bought is used.  Chop the angelica into small
  pieces, cover with warm water to rinse off some of the sugar and set aside
  for a few minutes.  While the angelica soaks, line 18 x 2 1/2 inch tartlet
  tins with the shortcrust pastry and start preparing the filling.  Dice and
  barely melt the butter in a small saucepan.  Away from the heat, beat in
  the honey, then the curd cheese, then the egg yolk mixed with the milk.
  Stir in the well drained angelica.  Whisk the egg white to snowy peaks and
  fold it in.  Spoon the mixture into the pastry-lined tartlet tins and bake
  at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6 for 30 minutes until puffed up and golden.
  Serve as soon as cooled from cooking.

           Seasoned flour                      1 ts Tamarind; soaked in water
      3 tb Vegetable oil                       8 oz Mushrooms
      1 tb Sesame oil                      2 1/2 pt Water
      1 oz Ginger root                         1 lb Potatoes; peeled & diced
           -- peeled & finely sliced                Sea salt
      5    Garlic cloves; peeled,sliced             Freshly ground pepper
      2    Dried chilies; broken             1/4 oz Coconut, grated
      1 tb Mustard seeds                       2 tb Chopped coriander leaves
 
  *Note: Any dense white fish, or 4 large shark steaks may be substituted for
  monkfish.
  
  Cut the fish into chunks and toss in the seasoned flour.  Heat the two oils
  together and throw in the ginger, garlic, chilies, mustard seeds and
  asafoetida.  Cook for a moment then add the fish, saute for another moment,
  then add the mushrooms, tamarind and the 2 1/2 pints of water with the
  pototoes.  Bring to the boil and simmer for 20 minutes.  Taste and season
  if necessary.  Add the coconut to thicken slightly, then throw in the
  coriander leaves.  Serve with saffron rice.

      Title: Bara Brith (Speckled Bread)
 Categories: Breads
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      6 oz Dried fruit                        10 oz Self-raising flour
      8 oz Dark brown sugar                    1    Egg
    1/2 pt Strong hot tea                 
 
  This is Wales' traditional rich fruit bread.  South Wales makes it with
  baking powder; Northerners prefer yeast as the raising agent.  Either way
  it's delicious.
  
  Soak the dried fruit and sugar overnight in the tea.  You can use either
  fresh tea, or the cold dregs from the teapot (this gives a good strong
  colour).  Next day, sieve the flour and fold it it into the fruit.  Mix in
  the lightly beaten egg.  Line a small loaf-tin with buttered paper then tip
  in the mixture, smoothing it well into the corners.
  
  Bake in a gentle oven at 300 F (150 C) gas mark 2 for 1 1/2 hours.  Cool
  and store for at least 2 days in a tin so that it matures moist and rich.
  Traditionalists say you should never butter the Bara Brith, but Dorothy
  says do, as it's lovely that way.

      Title: Tea and Lemon Ice
 Categories: Desserts
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 pt Strong fragrant tea *             1/2 pt Water
      2    Lemons                              1    Egg white
      8 oz Sugar                               6 tb Carbonated water
 
  *Note: Suggested teas are Lapsang Souchong or Earl Grey.
  
  In a Welsh household the kettle sits permanently on the hob ready to refill
  the teapot.  This delicious ice makes a refreshing change in summer. Or
  serve as a dessert with Welsh cakes or with a plate of buttered Bara Brith.
  Makes approximately 2 pints.
  
  Strain the tea and leave to cool.  Peel the lemons, avoiding the bitter
  pith, and squeeze the juice.  Bring the sugar and water to boil with the
  lemon rind, stirring to dissolve all the sugar.  Leave it to cool.  Beat
  the egg white lightly with the carbonated water.  Mix all the ingredients
  thoroughly with a whisk.
  
  Freeze the mixture - an ice-cream-maker is best.  If you use the ice-making
  compartment of the fridge, take it out when frozen, beat it until it has
  doubled in volume, and re-freeze it.  Don't serve the ice rock-hard -
  transfer it to the fridge half an hour before serving.

  lemon juice.  Serve piping hot, with wedges of lemon.

      Title: Laverbread and Crab Souffles with Cockle Sauce
 Categories: Seafood
      Yield: 8 servings
 
--------------------------------THE SOUFFLES--------------------------------
      1    Boiled crab; -OR-                   2 oz Flour
      6 oz -Prepared Crabmeat                3/4 pt Milk
      6 oz Prepared laverbread                 3    Eggs
           -OR- nori or spinach              1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
      2 oz Butter                                   Salt & pepper

--------------------------------COCKLE SAUCE--------------------------------
    1/4 pt White sauce from souffle mix        4 oz Cockles or clams (shelled)
    1/4 pt Whipping cream                      2 oz Prepared laverbread **
 
  If the crab is whole, pull the body apart and pick out all the meat -
  discarding only the mouthpiece and the grey "dead man's fingers" that
  fringe the inside carapace.  For extra flavour, make a stock with crab
  shell, flavoured with a piece of carrot and a quarter of onion, and boil
  down to a couple of well-flavoured tablespoons which can replace the
  equivalent milk in the basic white sauce given above.
  
  Prepare the white sauce; melt the butter in a small pan.  Stir in the flour
  and fry gently until the mixture is still pale but sandy.  Whisk in the
  milk slowly, beating till you have a thick sauce.  Simmer for 5 minutes.
  Preheat the oven to 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6.  Stir the crabmeat and
  prepared laverbread into the sauce.  Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg.
  Separate the eggs.  Beat the whites until quite stiff.  By now the sauce
  will be cool enough to stir in the yolks.  Fold in the whites, turning well
  to "tire" the mixture.  Taste and adjust the seasoning. Butter eight small
  souffle dishes and spoon in the mixture, leaving a finger's worth for
  expansion.  Bake for 10-12 minutes until puffed up and golden.
  
  Meanwhile make the cockle sauce.  Heat up the reserved white sauce with the
  cream.  Stir in the cockles and laverbread.  Season with the salt and
  freshly milled pepper.  Serve with the souffles as soon as they are ready.

      Title: Rich Venison & Mushroom Stew
 Categories: Meats, Main dish
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      2 lb Good stewing venison              3/4 pt (scant) beef or game stock
           -- (trimmed weight)                      Butter
      1    Onion                                    Oil
    3/4 lb Small flat mushrooms                     Flour
  2 1/2 fl Red wine vinegar                         Sugar
  2 1/2 fl Water                                    Bay leaves

--------------------------FOR THE FORCEMEAT BALLS--------------------------
      8 oz Fresh breadcrumbs               1 1/2 tb Lemon juice
      8 oz Grated suet                         1 lg Egg
      2    Lemons (grated zest only)           3 tb Fresh chopped parsley
 
  Cut the venison into large chunks and marinate for about 24 hours in the
  water and vinegar with 2 bay leaves and plenty of pepper.
  
  Make the forcemeat mixture, seasoning it well and binding it with the
  lightly beaten egg.  Shape into 24 small balls, fry briskly until golden-
  brown and crisp and reserve.  Then fry the mushrooms hard in a very little
  hot fat.  Remove and reserve separately.
  
  Drain and dry the meat well, reserving the marinade.  Dust the venison with
  well-seasoned flour and brown and seal in batches.  Transfer it to a 4 pint
  flameproof casserole; ideally this should be no more than 8 inches in
  diameter across the top.  Chop the onion finely and fry gently. Sprinkle on
  2 tablespoons flour, pour on the marinade liquid and the stock over the
  meat and season with salt, pepper, 1/2 teaspoon sugar and 2 bay leaves.
  
  Bring to a bare simmer, cover tightly and cook over the lowest possible
  flame (or in a low oven if you prefer) until the meat is deliciously tender
  and the gravy is dark and rich.  Shoulder meat may need as little as 1 1/2
  hours, lesser cuts of meat will need considerably more.  Stir occasionally
  to prevent sticking.  When ready, remove the bay and check seasoning. Cool
  and refrigerate overnight if not to be served on the same day.
  
  To finish the dish, bring everything back to room temperature.  Add the
  prepared mushrooms to the stew, pushing them well down into the gravy, then
  cover the surface with the forcemeat balls and bake - without a lid to keep
  the forcemeat balls really crisp - at 400 F (200 C) gas mark 6 for about 25
  minutes.

      Title: Highland Sausage Roll
 Categories: Meats, Main dish, Appetizers
      Yield: 4 servings
 
     10 oz Venison (trimmed weight)            3 tb Port
      6 oz Belly of pork (trimmed wt.)              Allspice, thyme or Worcester
      2 oz Pitted prunes                       1 lb Ready-made puff pastry
      1 sm Onion                               1    Beaten egg to glaze
           Remains of a pot of tea        
 
  Mince the meats fairly finely, chop the onion very finely and mix together.
  Season with a good grinding of pepper - but no salt - and some allspice,
  thyme or a few shakes of Worcester sauce.  Pour on the port and mix well,
  then cover and leave for several hours or overnight to allow the flavours
  to blend.  Cover the prunes with cold tea and leave to soak for several
  hours.
  
  Season the sausagemeat with salt and roll it into a long, fat sausage
  shape.  Roll the pastry out to a rectangle and lay the "sausage" down the
  length of it.  Lay the whole drained prunes on top of the meat.  Damp one
  long edge with beaten egg, roll up carefully and seal.  Alternatively you
  may like to enclose the sausage in a decorative pastry plait.  In this
  case, roll the pastry out to a square, lay the "sausage" down the centre
  and place the whole drained prunes on top.  Cut the pastry diagonally into
  1/2-inch strips on either side of the meat.  Damp the end of each pastry
  strip with beaten egg then fold the strips alternately from each side, over
  the meat to create a plait effect.  Seal the pastry ends.
  
  Slide the pastry parcel on to a damp baking sheet and glaze the top.  If
  you have made a sausage roll, decorate it with pastry leaves and make one
  or two steam slits in the top of the pastry.  Bake at 425 F (220 C) gas
  mark 4 for a further 25 minutes or so.

      Title: Glazed Venison Pate
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 2 servings
 
      1 lb Venison (trimmed weight)                 Whole and ground bay leaves
    1/2 lb Belly of pork (trimmed wt.)         1 tb Red wine vinegar
    1/2 lb Chicken livers                      1 tb Olive oil
      1 sm Orange                            1/4 pt Red wine
      1    Lemon                               1 ts Gelatine powder
      2    Garlic cloves                            A few kumquats to decorate
  1 1/2 ts Fresh thyme (more to taste)    
 
  Mince all three meats fairly finely and put them into a bowl.  Add the zest
  of the orange and lemon, the crushed garlic, the thyme, olive oil, vinegar,
  a generous pinch of powdered bay and plenty of black pepper.  Mix
  thoroughly and stir in the wine.  Cover and leave to marinate overnight.
  
  Season with salt - I find 1 teaspoon about right but fry a small nugget of
  the mixture to check.  Turn the pate into a terrine of about 2 1/4 pint
  capacity.  Pack the mixture well down into the corners of the dish and use
  a spoon to hollow out slightly the centre top.  Cover with greaseproof
  paper and foil, stand the dish in a roasting pan containing enough hot
  water to come halfway up the sides of the dish.  Bake at 325 F (160 C) gas
  mark 3 for 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 hours.
  
  Using a bulb baster, remove and reserve most of the juices that surround
  the pate.  Replace the greaseproof paper and foil, press the pate lightly
  with 1-1/2 to 2 lb weights and cool for 1-1/2 hours.  Then drain off any
  remaining juices that have not been re-absorbed by the pate.  Mix all the
  venison juices that you have collected with the juice of the orange and
  measure.  Add a splash of water if necessary to make 1/2 pint in total.
  Dissolve the gelatine powder in the mixture and use it to glaze the pate,
  adding a few bay leaves and kumquats to decorate if liked.

      Title: Snippets of Venison
 Categories: Meats
      Yield: 3 servings
 
    3/4 lb Best venison trimmings                   Garlic
      2 fl Cider                                    Juniper
      4 fl Good stock                               Unsalted butter
      6 oz Cap mushrooms                       4 fl Soured cream or Greek yogurt
      1 bn Chives                         
 
  Cut the meat into strips about the size of your thumb - if possible.  Some
  of the trimmings may, of course, be slightly ragged, triangular or cubed
  but this is the size and shape to aim for.  Dust with coarsely ground black
  pepper and 3 to 4 crushed juniper berries, moisten with the cider, cover
  and leave to marinate for 24 hours.  Crush a garlic clove, mix it with the
  soured cream or yoghurt and leave it to infuse in a cool place for 24
  hours.
  
  Carefully drain and dry the venison, reserving the marinade.  Slice the
  mushrooms thickly and saute them in a little very hot butter.  Remove and
  keep hot.  Then saute the venison briefly, searing it nicely but keeping it
  succulent and pink within - 2 minutes is plenty.  Then let the venison rest
  in a low oven where it will go on cooking a little without toughening.
  Start making the sauce straight away or wait for several minutes if you
  want the meat to lose its pinkness.
  
  To make the sauce, let the marinade liquid and the stock bubble away in the
  frying pan until reduced to just 2 or 3 spoonfuls.  Blend in any juices
  that the venison has exuded and bubble again briefly.  Then beat in the
  garlic-flavoured soured cream, away from the heat.  Return the pan to a low
  flame to warm the sauce.  Season well, scatter with chopped chives and
  serve on very hot plates.

      Yield: 4 servings
 
      2    Shallots; chopped                   1    Sprig of thyme
           Butter                              1    Curl of orange peel
     12 oz Whole green lentils (Le Puy)             Light stock or water
           Handful of chopped lovage      
 
  Soften the chopped shallots in a little butter without colouring them. Stir
  in the lentils.  Add a handful of chopped lovage, the sprig of thyme,
  orange peel and stock or unsalted water to cover well.  Simmer until
  tender.  Drain off and reduce the cooking liquor to make a little sauce,
  enriching it with more butter and seasoning to taste.  In the absence of
  lovage, use the young leaves and tenderest parts of a celery heart, and
  season the dish with a pinch each of celery salt, lemon zest and powdered
  curry spices.

      Title: Sweet-Pickled Cauliflower (Cavolfiore in Agrodolce)
 Categories: Relishes, Vegetables
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      1 lg Cauliflower                         1 pt Wine vinegar
           - about 2 lbs., trimmed wt.         1 tb Mustard seed
      2 oz Salt                                2    Short pieces cinnamon bark
      1 pt Water                             1/2 ts Cloves
      8 oz Onions                            1/2 ts Allspice
      1 lb Sugar                               3    Little dried red peppers
 
  Trim the cauliflower and divide it into florets.  Blanch the florets in
  boiling salted water for 5 minutes.  Drain them and run cold water through
  them immediately.  Slice the onions and layer them with cauliflower into
  sterilized jars.  Heat the vinegar with the sugar and spices, and pour the
  boiling mixture into the jars.  The florets should be submerged.  Cover and
  seal while hot.  Ready to eat in a week, the pickle will keep in a cool
  place all year.  Makes approximately 3 lb. pickle.
  
  Suggestions: Make an oeuf en cocette, very lightly cooked with a teaspoon
  of cream and serve it on a plate along with pickled cauliflower, sticks of
  cucumber, spring onions, and matchsticks of celery to dip into it.
  
  Toss a few cauliflower florets with a haricot bean salad dressed with olive
  oil, some of the pickling liquor, chopped garlic and parsley.
  
  Serve them as part of an antipasto with olives and slices of salad.

      Title: Pad Thai -- General Notes
 Categories: Misc, Thai
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Information:                   
 
  Rice Noodles:
  =============
  You can use fresh or dried, in widths from 1/8 to 1/2 inch wide.  I've
  never tried fresh.  The dried ones have to be soaked in water to soften
  them.  The recipes call for soaking in cold water, lukewarm water, hot
  water, and boiling water for anywhere from 7 minutes to 2 hours.  I put
  mine into warm tap water and let them soak while I'm preparing
  everything else.  Just before I start cooking, I dump them into a
  colander to drain.  One recipe suggests cellophane noodles as an
  alternative to rice noodles -- I've never tried that variation.
  
  Meat or No Meat:
  ================
  The most common meat called for is shrimp, with chicken and/or pork use
  in addition to or in place of the shrimp.  Some recipes add bean curd;
  some substitute it for the meat.  Jeff Smith's recipe uses deep fried
  bean curd.  My own variation is to substitute various veggies
  (asparagus, red bell pepper, broccoli, snow peas, or whatever else looks
  good.) As Nancie McDermott says, "Thai cooks blithely tinker with the
  classic formula to create signature variations, and you can, too."
  
  Oil and Seasonings:
  ===================
  Cooking pad thai starts with vegetable or peanut oil.  Most versions add
  garlic, and sometimes shallots, shrimp paste (be prepared for the
  smell!), onions, fresh red chilies, and/or preserved sweet white radish.
  
  The Sauce:
  ==========
  What makes pad thai, in addition to the rice noodles, is the sauce.  The
  general mix of flavors is sweet, salty, sour, and hot.  Typical
  ingredients are:
  
  ~~ fish sauce (sometimes soy sauce is used in addition, or in place of
  for pure vegetarian versions)
  ~~ sugar (sometimes palm sugar is suggested)
  ~~ vinegar (various kinds specified; tamarind sauce or lime juice are
  sometimes used instead)
  ~~ "red stuff" -- may be paprika, tomato paste, catsup, chili powder, hot
  chili sauce, chili paste with garlic, tomato sauce, or cayenne pepper,
  depending on the recipe.
  ~~ Other possible additions: salt, black pepper, chicken stock, dried
  shrimp powder.  One recipe calls for boiling the sauce before using.
  
  Eggs:
  =====
  Anywhere from 0-6.  Some recipes call for beating the eggs before
  adding; others suggested breaking the yolk after adding the egg to the
  pan.  Various techniques are suggested for manipulating the egg while
  cooking.  One recipe calls for cooking the egg before starting the pad
  thai, cutting it into strips, and then adding the egg strips back at the
  end of cooking.  I haven't tried this myself but have had it in
  restaurants.
  
  Bean Sprouts and Scallions:
  ==========================
  These are usually added last in cooking, or added to the finished dish
  without cooking.
  
  Garnishes:
  =========
  Various things can be added to finished dish as an edible garnish:
  
  ~~ lime or lemon wedges
  ~~ ground roasted chilies
  ~~ ground roasted peanuts
  ~~ dried red chili flakes
  ~~ fresh coriander leaves
  ~~ cucumber slices
  ~~ dried shrimps
  ~~ fried basil leaves
  ~~ cherry tomatoes
  ~~ mint sprigs
  
  Experiment, and enjoy!

      Title: Eggplant with Tofu
 Categories: Thai, Vegetables
      Yield: 4 servings
 
    3/4 lb Japanese eggplant                   5    Red chili peppers
           - (about 3 cups sliced)                  --  seeded and chopped
    1/4 lb Tofu                               10    -to
      6 tb Oil                                15    Sweet basil leaves
      2    -to                                 1 tb -to
      3    Garlic cloves; crushed              3 tb Yellow bean sauce
      1    -to                                      - (SEE NOTE)
 
  NOTE: (yellow bean sauce from Thailand is saltier than sauce from Hong
  Kong or China, so season to taste)
  
  Slice unpeeled eggplant crosswise into slices 1/8-inch thick.  Cut tofu
  into 1/2-inch cubes.  Heat oil in skillet; add garlic and stir-fry until
  light brown (don't burn!).  Add eggplant and tofu and cook for 5 to 7

      6 sm Red chile peppers                        - (omit for veggie version)
    1/2    Stalk fresh lemon grass            10    -to
      2    Kaffir lime leaves                 15    Basil leaves
      2 tb Oil                                 1 c  Chopped cabbage
 
  Thinly cut chicken into 2-inch strips.  (If doing veggie version, cut
  vegetables into thin strips.) Grind together red chili peppers, lemon
  grass, and kaffir lime leaves in a food processor or pound in a mortar.
  Heat oil to medium-high and saute pepper mixture for 3 minutes.  Stir in
  coconut milk and cook for 2 minutes.  Add chicken (or vegetables) and
  cook for 5 minutes or until cooked (same time for veggies).  Reduce heat
  to medium-low.  Stir in fish sauce (if using), salt, and basil.  Serve
  on a bed of chopped cabbage.
  
  Note:
  =====
  For mixed vegetables, choose from among bell peppers, string beans,
  water chestnuts, tomatoes (small cherry tomatoes are best), bamboo
  shoots, miniature corn, asparagus, cucumbers, zucchini, Japanese
  eggplant, and mushrooms.  I particularly like string beans or asparagus,
  a few cherry tomatoes, shredded (rather than sliced) bamboo shoots,
  miniature corn, and some straw mushrooms or slender (Japanese) eggplant.

      Title: Galloping Horses (Thai Appetizer)
 Categories: Thai, Appetizers
      Yield: 8 servings
 
      1 ts Oil                                 1    Fresh pineapple; -OR-
      1 lb Ground pork                         5    -Tangerines, -OR-
      4    -to                                 4    -Oranges
      8    Garlic cloves                     1/3 c  Sugar
           -- finely chopped                 1/2 ts Pepper
      3    Green onions, white part                 Lettuce leaves
           -- chopped                               Mint or coriander leaves
    3/4 c  Roasted salted peanuts                   Chopped chilis
 
  Grind peanuts.  Heat oil in a frying pan, add pork, garlic and onions.
  Cook until pink color disappears.  Drain off most of the fat.  Add sugar
  and pepper, cook 1-2 minutes.  Add peanuts, mix in well, then remove
  from heat.  Cool to room temperature.
  
  Prepare platter, lining with lettuce leaves.  Peel and segment the
  citrus fruit if used, cutting each segment down to the back and fanning
  open to form a circle.  If using pineapple, cut off top leaves and outer
  skin, as thinly as possible, from top down.  Look at the "eye" pattern,
  as it forms a spiral down the pineapple.  Cut the spirals with a sharp
  knife held at about a 45 degree angle.  Cut off bottom.  Cut pineapple
  into about 5 or 6 wedges and then cut each of those into 1/4 inch
  slices.  Arrange fruit on platter.
  
  Mound meat mixture onto fruit, and decorate with other garnishes.  Serve
  at room temperature, or chilled.

      Title: Green Bean Curry (Aka Country Curry or Jungle Curry)
 Categories: Thai
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      1 lb Fresh green beans                        Bamboo shoots (optional)
      2 tb Thai Curry Paste                    6 c  Chicken broth
      2 tb Vegetable oil                  
 
  Clean and pick green bean tips.  In a dutch oven (or equivalent size
  vessel), heat oil.  Add curry paste and "fry" until fragrant, about 1
  minute.  Add broth, green beans, bamboo shoots (or other vegetable).
  Bring to a rapid boil and cook like that for about 15-20 minutes
  (watching that liquid doesn't reduce too much; add water as necessary).
  Reduce heat to a hard simmer and continue cooking until green beans are
  VERY done and have absorbed the flavor of the curry broth.  Serve in
  bowls over rice.
  
  NOTES:
  If necessary, you may substitute whole frozen green beans for fresh.
  
  Thai Curry Paste: "Country Curry" or "Red Curry"; but they are all
  flavorful. Mae Ploy and Tommy Tang are other good brands.
  
  Bamboo shoots: I like to use a large can of bamboo tips because they are
  tender and I can cut them into 1/4 inch thick round slices. You can also
  use a couple of the small cans of sliced bamboo shoots, but they will
  not absorb the flavor as well.  I think carrots cut into coins would
  also be good, if you like those. I tried potatoes once, but they just
  disintegrated.)

      9 oz Flat rice sticks, 1/8" wide              - beans removed
           Vegetable oil                     1/4 c  Roasted, unsalted peanuts
    1/3 c  Fresh sweet basil leaves                 - coarsely ground
           - (Thai or purple basil)                 Cherry tomatoes; halved
      2    Red Serrano chili peppers                Lime wedges
           -seeded & very finely minced             Mint sprigs
      4    Garlic cloves; minced                    -OR- sliced green onions
  1 1/2 lg Boned chicken breast halves    
 
  Combine the vinegar, water, fish sauce, tomato paste, sugar, and dried
  shrimp in a small bowl; mix until well blended and reserve.  In a large
  pot, soak the noodles in enough water to cover.  In a small skillet or
  pot, heat vegetable oil 3/4 to 1 inch deep to 350 degrees, or until a
  dried rice noodle puffs instantly when dropped into the oil.  Deep-fry
  the basil leaves a few at a time, turning them once or twice until they
  are crisp, or 40 seconds to a minute; drain on paper toweling.
  
  Bring the noodles to a boil and cook them 2 minutes, or until they are
  almost tender.  Drain and rinse them well, then spread them on paper
  toweling to dry slightly.  Head a wok or large skillet and add about 2
  1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil.  Fry the Serrano peppers about 30
  seconds, then add the garlic and stir-fry until it is soft.  Add the
  chicken or pork and stir-fry until the chicken is almost opaque
  throughout or the pork is browned.  Stir in the shrimp and the sauce and
  mix completely.  Make a well in the center of the mixture and pour in
  the eggs.  When they are almost set, scramble them evenly.  Add half the
  noodles, throughly incorporating them into the mixture; stir in the
  remaining noodles and half the bean sprouts.  Cook just until the bean
  sprouts are nearly wilted.
  
  Heap the meat and noodles onto a platter.  Cover one half of them with
  ground peanuts and the other half with uncooked bean sprouts.  Ring the
  noodles with lime wedges, cherry tomatoes, and mint sprigs and garnish
  the top with the fried basil.

      Title: Nue Gra Pao: Stir-Fried Beef with Mint
 Categories: Thai, Meats
      Yield: 4 servings
 
      1 lb Flank steak                         3 tb Fish sauce
     14    Serrano chilies                     1 tb Granulated sugar
           - finely chopped                  1/2 c  Water (more if needed)
    1/4 c  Finely chopped garlic             1/2 c  Mint or basil leaves
    1/2 c  Finely chopped yellow onion              - (loosely packed)
    1/4 c  Vegetable oil; PLUS:                     Green lettuce leaves
      2 tb Vegetable oil                  
 
  This is a rich, hearty dish with plenty of typical Thai flavors.  Any
  kind of beef may be used, but flank steak works particularly well
  because it is easy to cut it across the grain, which helps keep the meat
  from falling apart during stir-frying and produces a tender result.  Be
  sure to serve plenty of rice, because it helps moderate the hot chilies
  without detracting from the flavor.  You may reduce the number of
  chilies by up to one half, but traditionally this dish should have a
  rich, hot chili flavor.
  
  =======================================================================
  
  1.  Slice the beef across the grain into strips 1/4 inch thick and 2 to
  3 inches long.  Set aside.
  
  2.  Pound or grind the chilies, garlic, and onion to a coarse paste in a
  mortar or blender.  If you use a blender you may need to add the oil to
  aid in grinding.
  
  3.  Heat a wok, add the oil, and swirl it over the surface of the pan.
  (Do not add more oil if you have ground the chilies, onion, and garlic
  in oil.) Add the paste from Step 2 and stir-fry until it is light
  golden.
  
  4.  Add the beef and stir-fry until it is a uniform tan color, but do
  not overcook it.
  
  5.  Add the fish sauce, sugar, water, and mint (or basil) leaves.  More
  water may be added if the sauce is too dry.  There should be about 1/2
  to 3/4 cup sauce, depending on how much water you added.
  
  Ahead of time note: The dish may be prepared a day in advance to this
  point.  To do so, proceed through Step 5, omitting the mint or basil
  leaves.  When you are ready to serve, heat the mixture and add the
  leaves.  If the meat has absorbed the liquid, add just enough warm water
  to bring it back to the original consistency.
  
  6.  Arrange a single layer of lettuce leaves in a serving bowl and put
  the beef mixture over them.  Serve the beef immediately or keep it warm
  while preparing other dishes.
  
  7.  Serve with rice.
  
  (Serves 4 to 6)

      Title: Nue Nam Tok: Grilled Beef with Thai Seasoning
 Categories: Thai, Meats
      Yield: 6 servings
 
      3    Serrano chilies                     2 tb Fish sauce
    1/4 c  White vinegar                       1 ts Ground roasted chilies *
  1 1/2 lb Flank steak                         2 tb Ground toasted rice **
    1/4 lb Red onion; sliced                        Red lettuce leaves
      4    Green onions                             Coriander sprigs
    1/4 c  Lime juice; PLUS:                        Mint or Basil leaves
      1 tb Lime juice                     
 
  1.  Remove the stems, but not the seedes, from the chilies.  Slice the
  chiles crosswise into pieces 1/8" thick.  Place the sliced chiles and
  vinegar in a small serving bowl.  Let it stand for at least 15 minutes.
  
  2.  Grill the beef to the desired doneness, preferably over charcoal.
  Slice it across the grain into strips 1/8" thick and 1 to 2 inches long.
  Put these in a large ceramic bowl.
  
  3.  Peel the red onion, remove the root portion, and slice the onion
  vertically into thin strips.  Slice the green onion diagonally into thin
  pieces.  Add both types of onion to the beef.
  
  4.  Add the lime juice, fish sauce, ground chilies, and ground rice.
  Mix well
  
  5.  Arrange a single layer of lettuce leaves on a serving platter, and
  place th beef mixture on top.  Garnish with sprigs of coriander and mint
  or basil leaves.
  
  6.  Serve at room temperature, the vinegar sauce (from Step 1) and rice.
  
  *  Use small hot chilies about 3 to 4 inches long.  Roast whole chillie
  stems and all, in a dry wok or skillet until the color changes to dark
  red or brown depending on the chilies used.  Be careful not to let them
  burn.  When the chilies have cooled, remove the stems and seeds.  Place
  the chilies in a food processor or blender and grind using short pulses.
  Pre-ground chilies are also commercially available, but often lack the
  "bite" of home ground ones and may be more expensive.
  
  ** Place uncooked rice in a dry wok or skillet and heat over moderate
  heat until deep golden brown,s tirring frequently to keep from burning
  and to allow it to develop a uniform color.  Watch the rice carefully
  after it begins to change colorand stir constantly because it can burn
  easily at this stage.  When it is auniform deep golden color, remove
  from heat and allow to cool to room temperature.  Grind it to a fine
  powder in a blender or a spice grinder.  This can be made in advance and
  kept in quantity so that there is always a supply on hand, but it is
  also easy to make up while preparing the dish.

  In the wok, fry the pork in the peanut oil at medium heat.  When half
  cooked, add the shrimps and garlic and stir.  Cook until shrimp and pork
  are done.
  
  Beat the egg and add it to the mixture.  Cook, stirring, for about half
  a minute.
  
  Turn the heat to high.  Add the drained noodles to shrimp mixture.  Add
  water, vinegar, fish sauce, sugar, shrimp powder, and most of the
  peanuts.  Sprinkle in white pepper and chili powder.  Toss to combine.
  Let it cook on one side (Don't stir; keep checking the underside as if
  it were a big pancake).  Flip it over as best you can and repeat until
  nearly cooked, about 5 to 10 minutes.
  
  Add most of the sprouts and scallions.  Stir and cook for another
  minute.
  
  Turn onto a plate.  Top with the rest of the sprouts, scallions, and
  peanuts.  Garnish with coriander and serve with a wedge of fresh lemon.

      Title: Pad Thai Pseudo-Vegetarian Style
 Categories: Thai
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/4 c  Thai fish sauce                     3 tb Oil
    1/4 c  White vinegar; plus:                2    Garlic cloves (or more)
      2 tb White vinegar                       2    Eggs
      4 tb Sugar (less if desired)           3/4 lb Bean sprouts
      1 ts Paprika                             3    Green onions
      8 oz Thai rice noodles                        - sliced on the diagonal,
           -- (about 1/4" thick)                    - including white part
      8 oz Tofu                              3/4 c  Ground peanuts
      2 tb Dried shrimp (optional)             1 tb Roasted red chili peppers *
 
  * [Take some dried red chili peppers and cook them in an ungreased wok
  over low stirring constantly until they start to brown. Grind in a
  coffee grinder or spice mill.]
  
  Instructions:
  =============
  Combine first four ingredients and let sit until sugar dissolves.  Soak
  rice noodles/sticks in warm water until they are soft but don't
  disintegrate when pressed, about 40 minutes.  Drain.  Drain tofu by
  wrapping it in a clean towel and pressing with a large can of tomatoes,
  about 30 minutes.  Cut into 1/4 inch cubes.  Rinse dried shrimp in water
  and drain.
  
  Put oil in wok, heat to medium, put in crushed garlic.  Swirl around for
  about a minute.  Add noodles and mix around for a minute or two.
  
  Add the tofu and shrimp then immediately add the liquid.  Keep stirring
  until the liquid has all been absorbed into the noodles, about a couple
  of minutes.
  
  Lower heat to low or medium-low.  Push some of the stuff aside at one
  end of wok, and break an egg in.  Immediately cover with noodles.  Do
  the same at the other end of wok.  Let the eggs cook *undisturbed* until
  the yolks are practically cooked, about three minutes.  (*Carefully*
  peak if unsure.) Slip a slotted spoon under each egg in turn, and bring
  upward, through the noodles, shaking as you go.  The idea is to break up
  the cooked egg into the rest of the mixture into tiny bits.
  
  Mix in sprouts and green onions.  Let cook for another two minutes.
  Turn off heat.  Add crushed peanuts and enough roasted red chilies to
  your desired hotness.

 Categories: Thai
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     16 oz Rice noodles                        1 tb Paprika
    1/2 c  Vegetable oil                     1/4 c  Sugar
      5    Garlic cloves (or more)             2    Eggs; beaten
           -- finely chopped                 1/4 lb Mung bean sprouts
      1 lb Medium shrimp                       3    Scallions
           -- shelled and deveined                  -- cut into 1/2 inch pieces
      2    Firm-style bean curd squares      1/2 c  Ground unsalted peanuts
           -- cut into 1/2 inch cubes          1    Fresh red chili pepper
    1/4 c  Pickled turnips                          -- seeded & coarsely chopped
           -- (coarsely chopped)               1    Lemon; cut into wedges
    1/2 c  White vinegar                            Coriander leaves for garnish
   3/16 c  Fish sauce                        1/4 c  Crushed red pepper (opt.)
 
  In a large bowl, soak the rice noodles in 10 to 12 cups of cold water
  for 2 hours.  Drain and cover with a damp towel to retain moisture.
  
  In a wok or large frying pan, heat the oil and stir-fry the garlic until
  it is light brown.  Add the shrimp, bean curd and pickled turnips; stir
  in the vinegar, fish sauce, paprika and sugar.  When thoroughly mixed,
  fold in the noodles.  When the noodles are completely coated, spread
  them out to the sides of the wok or frying pan, leaving a space in the
  middle.  Add the beaten eggs.  As the eggs cook, fold the noodles over
  them and stir to combine all of the ingredients evenly.  Stir in half of
  the bean sprouts, then add the scallions, ground peanuts and chopped
  chili pepper.  Toss several times to mix well.
  
  Serve on a large platter with lemon wedges.  Top with the remaining bean
  sprouts and garnish with coriander leaves.  Serve the crushed red pepper
  on the side, for those who like it extra-spicy.

      Title: Pad Thai with Shrimp
 Categories: Thai
      Yield: 1 servings
 
      8 oz Small size rice noodles             3 tb Fish sauce
      3 tb Tomato sauce                      1/2 lb Shrimp, cleaned and shelled
           -OR- tamarind paste                 1    Handful bean sprouts (fresh)
      2 tb Vegetable oil                            -- chopped once or twice
      1 tb Pickled radish                      2 oz Green onions
      3 tb Sugar                                    -- cut into 1/2 inch pieces
    1/3 c  Water or chicken stock              2 tb Finely chopped peanuts
      1    Egg                            
 
  1.  Soak the rice noodles in cold tap water about 20 minutes, until they
  are "springy".  Then drain in a colander until needed.
  
  2.  If using dried tamarind, soak the tamarind in hot water for awhile,
  then mash with a fork to soften.  Force as much of the mixture as you
  can through a seive to remove bits of bark, etc.
  
  3.  Heat oil in wok, and add the tamarind/tomato sauce, picked radish,
  and sugar.  Mix well and let heat up.
  
  4.  Add the noodles, small portions at a time, and and that water/stock.
  Mix well until all the noodles are coated with the mixture.  Add more
  liquid if necessary -- it will cook out.  Don't be easy on the noodles
  ~- chop them with the spatula or spoon some to separate them.  It may
  help to "toss" the noodles like a salad, to get them coated.
  
  5.  Beat the egg and mix with the noodles.  Add the fish sauce and
  shrimp.  Mix everything thoroughly.  The noodles will tend to "clump",
  so stir or "toss" like a salad to get everything mixed, and to ensure
  that the egg and shrimp cook thoroughly.  It will help to cover the wok
  with a lid for a minute or so, then toss the mixture, then cover again.
  You'll know it's done when the shrimp are completely pink.  There may be
  a little browning of the noodles; stirring will keep them from burning.
  
  6.  Add the bean sprouts, green onions, and chopped peanuts.  Mix well,
  then turn off the heat and let stand a minute or so.  Serve.

      Title: Paht Thai
 Categories: Thai
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/4 lb Dried rice stick noodles            2 tb Coarsely chopped peanuts
      2 tb Vegetable oil                            -- (dry-roasted type)
      1 tb Coarsely chopped garlic             1 c  Bean sprouts
      8    Shrimps, peeled and deveined        4    Slender green onions
      1    Egg; lightly beaten                      -- sliced in 1 inch lengths
      1 tb Fish sauce                          1    Lime; quartered lengthwise
      2 ts Sugar                          
 
  Paht Thai is a noodle dish almost everyone seems to like.  A tangle of
  slender rice noodles is sauteed with garlic, shallots, and an orchestra
  of sweet, sour, and salty ingredients that play a piquant symphony of
  Thai flavors.  A handful of fresh bean sprouts provides a cooling
  contrast to the hot, seasoned noodles, and circles of lime invite you to
  bring sourness to center stage as you begin to eat.
  
  Traditional ingredients are salty dried shrimp; crispy pieces of fried,
  pressed bean curd; sweet-sour nuggets of pickled white radish; chopped
  peanuts; flat, green garlic chives; and a balanced chorus -- sweet,
  sour, salty, hot -- of palm sugar, tamarind, vinegar, lime, brown bean
  sauce, and crushed dried red chilies.
  
  Thai cooks blithely tinker with the classic formula to create signature
  versions, and you can, too.  Siriluk Williams, owner of Sukothai
  Restaurant in Ft.  Lauderdale, Florida, gave me her recipe for
  home-style paht Thai.  I love its accessible ingredients, simple steps,
  and delicious results.
  
  Instructions:
  =============
  Soak rice noodles in warm water to cover for 15 to 20 minutes.
  Meanwhile, prepare all the remaining ingredients and place them next to
  the stove, along with a small serving platter.  When the noodles are
  very limp and white, drain and measure out 2 1/2 cups.  Set these by the
  stove as well.
  
  Heat a wok or large, deep skillet over medium-high heat.  Add 1
  tablespoon of the oil and swirl to coat the surface.  When the oil is
  very hot, drop a piece of the garlic into the pan.  If it sizzles
  immediately, the oil is ready.  Add the garlic and toss until golden,
  about 30 seconds.  Add the shrimp and toss until they turn pink and are
  opaque, no more than 1 minute.  Remove from the pan and set aside.
  
  Add the egg to the pan and tilt the pan to spread it into a thin sheet.
  As soon as it begins to set and is opaque, scramble it to break it into
  small lumps.  Remove from the pan and set aside with the shrimp.
  
  Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, heat for 30 seconds, and add the
  softened noodles.  Using a spatula, spread and pull the noodles into a
  thin layer covering the surface of the pan.  Then scrape them into a
  clump again and gently turn them over.  Hook loops of noodles with the
  edge of the spatula and pull them up the sides, spreading them out into
  a layer again.  Repeat this process several times as the stiff, white
  noodles soften and curl into ivory ringlets.  Add the fish sauce and
  turn the noodles so they are evenly seasoned.  Add the sugar and
  peanuts, turning the noodles a few more times.
  
  Reserving a small handful for garnish, add the bean sprouts, along with
  the green onions and shrimp-egg mixture.  Cook for 1 minute, turning
  often.  Transfer the noodles to the serving platter and squeeze the
  juice of 2 lime wedges over the top.  Garnish with remaining bean
  sprouts and lime wedges and serve at once.
  
  Serves 1 as a main course, 2 as an appetizer.

      Title: Thai Chicken and Coconut Milk Soup (Tom Ka Gai or Kai Tom Ga
 Categories: Soups, Thai
      Yield: 1 servings
 
     12 oz Canned coconut milk                      -- (1/16") slices on the
           -- such as Chaokoh                       -- diagonal
    1/4 lb Chicken breast                      3 sl Galanga (more if desired)
           -- cut into small chunks                 --OR substitute fresh ginger
      1    Lime; juice and grated peel              Hot chile peppers to taste
      1    4" piece of lemon grass                  -- cut into thin circles
           -- cut into very thin                    Cilantro for garnish
 
  * Note: preferably Thai birds, with serranos an acceptable substitute,
  (though I've used sweet Fresno chiles in a variation I'll describe
  below).
  
  Instructions:
  =============
  Pour the lime juice on the chicken and let stand while you prepare the
  rest of the soup.  In a medium saucepan, place the coconut milk, lemon
  grass, grated lime peel, galanga or ginger, and (optionally) chiles.
  (The optional part is that if you don't want the whole dish to taste
  spicy, add the chiles later; the earlier you add them, the hotter the
  resulting dish.) Bring the coconut milk to a simmer.
  
  When the soup is simmering, add the lime-soaked chicken pieces and stir
  to distribute them.  Reduce the heat so the soup stays just below a boil
  and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, or till the chicken pieces are finished
  cooking.  Remove from heat and serve immediately with fresh cilantro
  leaves for garnish.
  
  Now, the *best* way I ever had this soup was with pieces of fresh
  grouper instead of chicken.  I also added slices of kumquats instead of
  the ginger, and used the sweet Fresno chiles instead of Thai birds.  We
  also served it over Vietnamese rice noodles.  Was it southeast Asian or
  Caribbean?  Who cares, it was wonderful.  If you can't find grouper,
  it'd be good with any tender, delicate white fish -- sole, maybe, or a
  very fresh sea bass, or maybe little chunks of monkfish.  I believe I've
  had this with shrimp as well.  (Grouper, BTW, is a type of fish common
  in the Caribbean and, if I recall, in other warm-water parts of the
  world; the flesh is very white, very tender, and quite delicately
  flavored.  I've seen it in one Asian grocery store in the Bay Area, as
  well as in the Bahamas, so I'd guess that Gulf Coast netters should be
  able to find it readily.)
  
  Notes:
  ======
  1.  Galanga is similar to ginger, an edible rhizome available in most
  Asian groceries.  If not available fresh, you can usually find it
  frozen.  (Well, this is the SF Bay Area; if you can't find it at Tin Tin
  or the New Castro Market, you have to have friends smuggle it in from
  Bangkok for you...  Other parts of the country may vary.)
  
  2.  Chile peppers add a lot to the dish; I've had it so hot that I could
  barely eat it, and I've had it completely smooth, sweet and mild.  I
  like it in the middle.
  
  3.  Lemon grass adds a lot to the flavor and aroma, but as near as I can
  tell it isn't edible unless you puree it.  (If there's sufficient
  demand, I'll print my recipe for Vietnamese turkey fajitas.) I just eat
  around the slices of lemon grass and ginger.

           --(the unsweetened kind)            1    Carrot; grated
      3 tb Chopped scallions                        Juice from (8?) limes

           - cubed into smallish pieces             - but powdered will do)
           Chicken                             1 ts Galanga powder
 
  * (I sometimes leave this out.  Niels says that's defeating the whole
  point, but I think it still comes out great)
  
  Instructions:
  =============
  Heat the coconut milk in a pot.  Add everything else.  As the lemon
  grass is inedible, put it in a tea ball and immerse the ball in the soup
  so you can retrieve it later.  Cook until the chicken is done and the
  soup is hot (30 minutes?).  Taste to see if it needs more limes (it
  always does) or more hot peppers (it's better to start mild and build up
  to the desired level of spicyness).

      1 ts Sesame Oil                          2 lg Carrots; cut into pieces
      3    Whole cloves                        1    Chicken, cut into pieces **
      2    Bay leaves                          6 c  Water
      1    Sprig of fresh thyme *        

------------------------------EVERYTHING ELSE------------------------------
           Mushrooms ***                            -- chewing on them.)
           Shrimp if you want ***              4    Kaffir lime leaves
      1    Stalk lemongrass                         Cilantro leaves as desired
           -- cut into 2 inch pieces           1 ts Chili sauce
      2 sl Galanga root                        2 tb Fish sauce
           -- (more if you like            1 1/2 tb Lemon juice

----------------------------------OPTIONAL----------------------------------
           Sliced hot peppers                       -(2 or 3 slices per serving)
 
  * (ad libbed with about 1 tsp or 1 tblsp of powdered thyme)
  
  ** (Some boneless skinless chicken pieces, plus some thighs with the
  bones bashed once with the back of a knife would be ok too -- the point
  being to get the flavor from the marrow out.)
  
  *** as many as you want, cut any way you want, of any kind you want
  
  Instructions:
  =============
  Use a large covered stockpot.  Heat olive and sesame oil on high heat.
  Add cloves, bay leaves, thyme, (these should be pounded a bit first to
  crack the fibers and release more flavor) and onion, carrots.  Cover 2
  minutes, stir if you want.
  
  Add chicken on top, and pour ONE cup of water over the tops of the
  chicken.  Cover.  Cook 5 minutes on high.
  
  Add remainder of water, cover, continue heating till it starts to boil,
  then turn heat down and simmer covered 30 minutes.  Skim off foam
  occasionally.  Remove chicken, debone, and cut into bite sized pieces.
  Strain soup, avoid getting the sediment at the bottom.  (What you do
  with the leftover veggies after making a stock is up to you.  I think
  they end up in Minnesotan hot dishes....)
  
  Take 4 cups of the stock, heat until it begins to boil, turn down the
  heat till it is just simmering.  Add galanga, lemongrass, Kaffir lime
  leaves (bash them a bit to break the fibers--it allows them to release
  more flavor).  Add mushrooms, chicken, (shrimp if you must).  Stir in
  the fish sauce, chili paste.  Cover, cook for another 5 minutes.  Serve.
  
  Add lemon juice (just have slices of lemon or lime that you can squeeze)
  cilantro, and thinly sliced jalepenos or other hot peppers at the table.
  Fresh liquorice basil also adds a nice touch.
  
  Comments/Modifications:
  =======================
  We cheated and used Swansons reduced salt chicken stock for the water in
  the beginning because we used boneless skinless chicken.  Can't tell if
  it hurt or helped.
  
  Also had 4 shiitake mushrooms which had been soaking for several days,
  so they were cut up, and the soaking juice was added along with the
  chicken and mushrooms.  About one cup of this.  Big win.  Yum.

      Title: Pad Thai (5)
 Categories: Thai
      Yield: 1 servings
 
    1/2 lb Dried rice noodles 1/8" wide      1/2 c  Vegetable oil
           -Warm Water                              - (more if needed)
    1/2 lb Shrimp, chicken or pork             1 ts Chopped garlic
           -OR- a combination                  2    Eggs
    1/4 c  Fish sauce                        3/4 lb Bean sprouts
    1/4 c  Granulated sugar; plus:                  Ground roasted chiles
      2 tb Granulated sugar                         - (see note at end)
    1/4 c  White vinegar; plus:                     Unsalted roasted peanuts
      2 tb White vinegar                            - ground
      1 ts Paprika                                  Lime wedges
      4    Green onions                   
 
  1.  Soak noodles for 20-25 minutes in enough warm water to cover them.
  They should be flexible and soft, but not so soft that they can be
  mashed easily with the fingers.  Later cooking in liquid will soften
  them more.  Drain them throughly in a colander while preparing the other
  ingredients.  Traditionally they are left in full-length strands, but
  you may cut them into 8 inch lengths if you find it easier to stir-fry
  then that way.
  
  2.  Peel and devein the shrimp leaving the tails intact(or remove if
  preferred) Slice chicken, pork into 1/8 inch strips 1-2 inches long.
  
  3.  Mix the fish sauce, sugar, vinegar, and paprika in a bowl and stir
  until the sugar dissolves.  Set aside.  Slice green onions both the
  green and white parts, diagonally into 1-1/2 inch long pieces.  Set
  aside.
  
  4.  Heat a wok, add the oil and swirl over the surface.  Add the garlic
  and stir fry until light golden.  Add the meat and stir-fry until shrimp
  is pink.  If using chicken or pork stir-fry until pink disappears.  Add
  the noodles and toss lightly to coat with oil and the distribute meat
  and garlic( I often do this in a larger pot since things tend to come
  out of the wok).
  
  5.  Add the liquid from step 3 and bring it to a boil rapidly, gently
  folding the noodles without breaking them.  Reduce heat to medium and
  boil the mixture, folding frequently until the noodles have absorbed the
  liquid (I find a pasta server works great for this step).
  
  6.  Lift the noodles gently from one side of the wok.  Pour a little oil
  along the side of the wok, then break the egg ad slip it into the oil.
  Break the yolk and cover the egg with the noodles immediately.  Repeat
  this on the opposite side with the other egg.  Allow eggs to cook
  undisturbed, over moderate heat until they are set and almost dry.
  Additional oil may by added if the eggs or the noodles begin to stick to
  the wok.
  
  7.  When the eggs are set and almost dry, fold them gently but rapidly
  into the noodles.  Try not to break the noodles, which will be soft and
  fragile at this point.  An effective way is to insert the scoop under
  the eggs, lift it through, and fold the mixtureover.  Continue the
  lifting and folding motion until the eggs are broken up and well
  distributed.
  
  8.  Add the green onions (and bean sprouts if you prefer them mixed in)
  and toss the entire mixture quickly and gently, stll avoiding breaking
  the noodles.  Cook for about 2 minutes or until onions are tender.
  
  9.  Take a large platter spread with bean sprouts(if you left them out
  above).  Spread Pud Thai from wok over top.  Sprinkle ground chilies(see
  note) and ground peanuts over the top and squeeze lime over the top.  Or
  serve toppings seperatly for each diner to add according to taste.
  
  Note on chilies: Buy whole dried chiles and grind since pre-ground often
  lack the "bite" of whole ones.  Thai chilies may be used (_VERY_ hot),
  or milder American chiles may be used.  The Thai chilies are know as
  Prig hang.  They may also be found in Mexican food sections under the
  name "Chiles Arbol".  Use sparing if you aren't used to them they are
  quite potent.

           -(10-16 oz pkg = 0.3-0.5 kg)      1/4 c  Chopped/ground peanuts
      2 tb Oil (30 ml)                         1    Red chile (optional)
      3    Garlic cloves, or more                   - finely chopped
           - crushed or minced                      -OR-
      8 oz Shrimp, peeled (optional)           1 ts -Red pepper flakes
      8 oz Chicken, Pork or more Shrimp        1 c  Sliced cabbage
           - (Optional), cut into dice              Cilantro leaves
           - or matchsticks                         Lime wedges
      3    Eggs                          

-----------------------------------SAUCE-----------------------------------
    1/4 c  Thai Fish Sauce                     2 tb White sugar
    1/4 c  White Vinegar                       3 tb Paprika
 
  Soak the rice noodles in cold water at least two hours before cooking.
  Drain.
  
  In a large wok, heat oil and stir-fry garlic for 30 seconds.  Add shrimp
  and other meat if used.
  
  Add the noodles, and stir-fry until al dente.  Add sauce ingredients,
  cook to allow most of this to be absorbed (2 minutes or so).
  
  Spread the noodles, etc.  out to the sides, and add eggs.  Some will
  crack the eggs directly into the wok, others will pre-scramble.  If
  cracked into the pan, start stirring them up when partially cooked, so
  you get 'streaky' yellow and white eggs.  As they cook, fold the noodle
  mixture back in.
  
  Add 1/2 the bean sprouts, peanuts, red pepper, folded into the mixture.
  
  Serve hot, garnished with the rest of the bean sprouts, chopped cabbage,
  cilantro.  Serve with lime wedges to be squeezed into the noodles.
  
  In my house, we have doctored this with thai hot chile sauce, sweet and
  sour sauce, or sate-style peanut sauce.  It takes to any of these very
  well, depending on your tastes.

      Title: Peanut Sauce (2)
 Categories: Thai, Sauces
      Yield: 1 servings
 
           Vegetable oil                            Salt
           -- for deep-frying                1/2 ts Chilli powder
      4 oz Whole shelled peanuts                    -OR- sambal ulek*
      1 sl Terasi*                           1/2 ts Brown sugar
      2    Shallots; peeled and chopped       14 fl Water
      1    Garlic clove                        1 oz Creamed coconut* (optional)
           -- peeled and chopped               1 tb Lemon juice
 
  Method:
  =======
  To make the sauce: Heat the oil in a wok or deep frying pan (deep-fat
  fryer) and fry the peanuts for 5 to 6 minutes.  Drain thoroughly on
  kitchen paper towels.  Allow to cool, then work to a fine powder in an
  electric grinder, or with a pestle and mortar.
  
  Put the terasi, shallots and garlic, if using, in a cobek or mortar.
  Pound to a very smooth paste, then add a little salt.  Heat 1 tablespoon
  vegetable oil in a pan, add the paste and fry for 1 minute, stirring
  constantly.  Add the chili powder or sambal ulek, sugar and water, bring
  to the boil, then add the ground peanuts.  Stir well, then simmer until
  thick, stirring occasionally.  Add the creamed coconut (santen) if
  using, and stir until dissolved.  Keep hot.
  
  Note:
  =====
  This really isn't as time-consuming as it sounds, providing you use
  roasted peanuts (avoiding the deep-frying step), and get your terasi,
  sambal ulek and coconut milk from the nearest Asian market.  I must have
  had a lot of time on my hands the first time I made this, as I decided
  to eschew the grinder and use a mortar and pestle.

  *terasi [Malaysia] Also known as balachan/blacan (Malaysia), kapi
  (Thailand) and ngapi (Burma).  A kind of pungent shrimp paste, used in
  very small quantities.  Depending on the recipe in which it is used, it
  can be crushed with spices to make a paste which is then sauteed in oil.
  Alternatively, it may be grilled (broiled) or fried first, then added to
  other ingredients.
  
  *sambal ulek [Indonesia]  Used as an accompaniment and in cooking.
  Made by crushing fresh red chillis with a little salt: Remove the
  seeds from the  chillis, chop finely, then crush with salt using a
  pestle and mortar.  Three chillis will make about 1 tablespoon
  sambal ulek.  also available redy-prepared in small jars from
  Oriental stores and some delicatessens.
  
  *santen [Malaysia] see coconut milk.
  
  Coconut milk [India/Malaysia/Thailand/Vietnam]  Known as narial ka
  dooth in India, santen in Indonesia and Malaysia.  Best made from
  fresh coconuts:  Grate the flesh of 1 coconut into a bowl, pour
  on 600 ml/1 pint/2-1/2 cups boiling water, then leave to stand
  for about 30 minutes.  Squeeze the flesh, then strain before using.
  This quantitiy will make a thick coconut milk, add more or less water
  as required.  Desiccated (shredded) coconut can be used instead of
  fresh coconut:  Use 350g/12 oz./4 cups to 600 ml/1 pint/2-1/2 cups
  boiling water.  Use freshly made coconut milk within 24 hours.
  Canned coconut milk is also available.

  1.  Soak the noodles for 20-25 minutes in enough warm water to cover
  them.  They should be flexible and soft, but not so soft that they can
  be mashed easily with the fingers.  Later cooking in liquid will soften
  them more.  Drain them thoroughly in a colander while preparing the
  other ingredients.  Traditionally they are left in full-length strands,
  but you may cut them into 8-inch lengths if you find it easier to
  stir-fry them that way.
  
  2.  Peel and devein the shrimp, leaving the tails intact, or slice the
  chicken or pork across the grain into strips not more than 1/8 inch
  thick and 1 to 2 inches long.
  
  3.  Mix the fish sauce, sugar, vinegar, and optional paprika, tomato
  paste, or catsup in a bowl, and stir until the sugar is dissolved.  Set
  the mixture aside.  Slice the green onions, both white and green parts,
  diagonally into pieces 1 1/2 inches long and 1/4 inch thick.  Set aside.
  
  4.  Heat a wok, add the oil, and swirl it over the surface of the pan.
  Add the garlic and stir-fry until light golden.  Add the meat and
  stir-fry until the pink color disappears completely.  If you are using
  shrimp, stir-fry until they turn pink.  Add the noodles and toss lightly
  to coat them with oil and to distribute the meat and garlic.
  
  5.  Add the liquid from Step 3 and bring it to a boil rapidly, gently
  folding the noodles without breaking them.  Reduce the heat to medium
  and boil the mixture, folding frequently, until the noodles have
  absorbed the liquid.
  
  6.  Using a wok scoop or a stiff spatula, lift the noodles gently from
  one side of the wok.  Pour a little oil along the side of the wok, then
  break 1 egg and slip it into the oil.  Break the yolk, and cover the egg
  with the noodles immediately.  Repeat this on the opposite side of the
  wok with the remaining egg.  Allow the eggs to cook undisturbed, over
  moderate heat, until they are set and almost dry.  Additional oil may be
  added if the eggs or the noodles begin to stick to the wok.
  
  7.  When the eggs are set and almost dry, fold them gently but rapidly
  into the noodles.  Try not to break the noodles, which will be soft and
  fragile at this point.  An effective way is to insert the scoop under
  the eggs, lift it through, and fold the mixture over.  Continue the
  lifting and folding motion until the eggs are broken up and well
  distributed.
  
  8.  Add the bean sprouts and sliced green onions and toss the entire
  mixture quickly and gently, still avoiding breaking the noodles.  Cook
  for about 2 minutes, or until the bean sprouts and green onions are
  crisp-tender.
  
  9.  Place the mixture on a large warm platter.  Sprinkle the ground
  chilies and peanuts over the top and squeeze lime juice over that, or
  serve these garnishes separately, for each diner to add according to
  taste.
  
  Variation:
  ==========
  Omit the shrimp, pork, or chicken from the list of ingredients, and
  ignore any instructions for them.  Substitute 1/2 pound tofu and 1/4
  pound dried shrimp.  Put the tofu on a triple layer of paper towels,
  cover it with another triple layer, put a plate on top of that, and put
  a 2-pound weight, e.g.  a can of tomatoes, on top of the plate.  Let
  stand for 20 to 30 minutes to press out the excess water.  Put the dried
  shrimp in a sieve, rinse them quickly under hot running water, and set
  them aside to drain.  After the tofu has been pressed, slice it into
  1/4-inch cubes.  Add the tofu and shrimp in Step 5 of the instructions
  and proceed with the main recipe.  Note: in Thailand, dried shrimp are
  available in a smaller size than is generally available in the United
  States.  If you would like to simulate that, chop the dried shrimp very
  coarsely after they have been rinsed.
