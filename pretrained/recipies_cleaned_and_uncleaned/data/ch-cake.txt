Chocolate Fudge Cake

cakes, chocolate

1 pound milk chocolate
1/2 pound semisweet or extra-bittersweet choc; olate
3/4 pound softened butter
1  fudge cake
3 cup cake flour
2 cup light-brown sugar
2 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup milk
3  eggs
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 ounce unsweetened chocolate
6 ounce softened butter

MILK CHOCOLATE FROSTING

PREPARATION:  FROSTING.  Chop both chocolates into coarse bits and
melt in a double boiler set over hot (not boiling) water. Stir
occasionally until completely melted.  Remove pan from hot water and
allow the chocolate to cool until just no longer warm to the touch,
about 20 minutes. Place the butter in a bowl and beat in the cooled
chocolate until the mixture is evenly blended, about 3 minutes.
Frosting can be stored at a cool temperature for up to 3 days, or
several months in the freezer. Heat the oven to 350F. Butter two
9-inch round cake pans and line them with buttered and floured
parchment paper or waxed paper.

FUDGE CAKE.  Sift the flour.  Measure 3 cups.  In a large bowl, mixx
together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt,
breaking up any lumps of sugar. In a small bowl, whisk about 1/2 cup
of the milk with the eggs and vanilla; set aside. Chop the chocolate
into coarse bits and melt in a double boiler set over hot (not
boiling) water. Combine the remaining cup of milk and the butter with
the mixed dry ingredients and beat for 1 1/2 minutes, scraping the
sides of the bowl twice. Add the egg mixture in 3 parts, scraping the
sides of the bowl and beating for 20 seconds after each addition. Add
the melted chocolate and beat until just incorporated. Pour the
batter into the prepared pans and bake in the center of the preheated
oven until the cake springs back when lightly pressed in the center,
25 to 30 minutes. Cool the cakes in their pans for 10 minutes and
invert onto racks. Cool completely before frosting. Frost the top
surface of one layer of cake and top with the second layer. Spread
the remaining frosting on the top and sides of the cake. Make a
decorative pattern zigzag in the frosting by pulling a serrated knife
across the surface in a back-and-forth motion.  Use a small spatula
or spoon handle to pull out spikes of frosting all around the sides.
Cake can be completed a day ahead and refrigerated.

SERVING:  Return to room temperature if refrigerated. Cut into wedges
and serve.

Makes one 9-inch cake.

1 cup granulated sugar
2  to 4 teaspoon creme de cacao, kahlu; dark rum
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1  butter and powdered cocoa for the p; an
1  frosting:
1 cup sour cream at room temperature
14 ounce baker's semi-sweet chocolate (do no; t substitute)

degrees.  Butter an 8 inch springform pan, and coat with powdered
cocoa.

Melt chocolate and butter in a double boiler over hot, but *not
boiling*, water. (don't rush this step, chocolate burns easily)

c of the granulated sugar.  Beat until yolk mixture is pale yellow
and thick, 4 to 6 minutes. Add melted chocolate mixture to the yolk
mixture. Beat until completely smooth.  Add vanilla and liquor of
your choice. Beat until blended.

Chocolate Fudge Icing (For Plain Cake)

cakes, chocolate

1 cup minus 1 tablespoon rich milk
1  remove from heat and stir in until; dissolved:
2 cup sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
2 ounce grated chocolate

Re: Chocolate Fudge Icing

This icing recipe is a candy recipe with milk added to make it into
frosting.

Bring to a boil in a large heavy pan:

Bring to a boil and cook covered 2-3 minutes until the steam washes
down from the sides of the pan any crystals which may have formed.
Uncover, redice heat and cook without stirring to soft-ball stage,
238 degrees. When nearing 238, there is a fine  overall bubbling
with, simultaneously, a coarser patter, as though the fine bubbled
areas were being pulled down for quilting into the  coarser  ones.
Remove from heat without jostling or stirring.  Cool the  candy  to
110. You may hasten this process by placing the hot pan in a larger
pan of cold water until the bottom of the pan has cooled.  Add: 2 4
TBSP butter

Beat fudge partially.  Add: 1 teaspoon vanilla

Then beat until it begins to lose its sheen.  At this point the drip
from the spoon, when you flip it over, holds its shape against the
bottom of the spoon. Quickly add: 1/2 1 c. broken nut meats

Pour  the  fudge into a buttered pan.  Cut into squares before it
hardens. To  use  fudge for centers, beat until thick, knead and
shape.

For chocolate fudge icing, the book says to:

Use in all: 1 c. milk

Beat until the icing is of the right consistency to be spread.

      ----CHOCOLATE FUDGE FILLING----
2/3 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup heavy cream
2 1/2 ounce unsweetened chocolate
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
2 tablespoon unsalted butter
      ----CHOCOLATE CREAM----
2 1/2 cup heavy cream
3 1/2 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder (preferabl; y dutch process)
7 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
      ----ASSEMBLY AND CHOCOLATE SYRUP---
3 tablespoon chocolate chips
2 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder (preferabl; y dutch process)
2 tablespoon light corn syrup
1 tablespoon granulated sugar

PREPARE THE CAKE LAYERS:  Preheat the oven to 350 F. Line two 9-inch
round cake pans with waxed paper; butter and flour the pans; tap out
any excess flour. In a mixer bowl, beat the butter until light and
fluffy. Gradually add the sugar and continue beating until smooth.
One at a time, beat in the eggs until well-blended. Sift together the
flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt.  Add to the egg
mixture in thirds, alternating with the milk, mixing only until
blended. Blend in the vanilla and liqueur. Divide the batter between
the two prepared pans.  Bake until the tops of the cakes are springy
to the touch, 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and set on racks
to cool for 30 minutes. Loosen the edges with a knife and unmold.
Peel off the waxed paper.  Set the cakes on a rack and let cool
completely. PREPARE THE FILLING: Combine the sugar, cream, chocolate
and corn syrup in a small heavy saucepan. Bring to a simmer over
moderate heat, stirring frequently.  Reduce the heat to low and cook
for 10 minutes, or until the mixture thickens. Remove from the heat,
dot the top with the butter and let cool to room temperature, about
15 minutes. When cool, stir in the butter until the fudge filling is
smooth and creamy. PREPARE THE CHOCOLATE CREAM: Beat the cream and
cocoa until soft peaks form. Gradually add the confectioners' sugar
and continue beating until stiff. ASSEMBLE THE CAKE:  Cover one cake
layer with all of the fudge filling. Sprinkle evenly with the
chocolate chips. Spread 1/2 cup of the chocolate cream on top of the
chips.  Top with the second cake layer and cover the top and sides of
the cake iwth half of the remaining chocolate cream. Use the
remainder in a pastry bag to decorate the cake as desired.
Refrigerate for up to 3 hours before serving time. PREPARE THE SYRUP:
Combine the cocoa, corn syrup, sugar and 2 tablespoons of water in a
small heavy saucepan. Bring to a simmer over low heat and cook,
stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Transfer the syrup to a small
bowl and let cool to room temperature, stirring once or twice, to
prevent a skin from forming. Just before serving, drizzle the syrup
over the top of the cake in a lacy design.

Devil's Food Cake With Fudge Frosting (U. S.)

cakes, chocolate, deserts

1 3/4 cup sifted cake flour
1/2 cup cocoa powder (not a mix)
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup (1 stk) unsalted butter
1 1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
2 large eggs
1 cup boiling water
1  frosting:
1/4 cup (1/2 stk) unsalted butter
2 cup unsifted confectioners' (10x) sugar
2  squares (1 ounce each) unsweetened; colate, melted
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
2 tablespoon half-and-half, milk or evaporated m; ilk

CAKE:

PREHEAT THE OVEN TO 350F. Grease two 8-inch layer cake pans well,
then dust then generously with cocoa. (This gives the cake layers a
rich brown finish). Sift the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt onto
a piece of waxed paper and set it aside. Cream the butter until it is
fluffy, add the sugar and vanilla, and continue beating until the
batter is silvery and light. Beat the eggs in one by one, then add
the sifted dry ingredients, alternately with the boiling water,
beginning and ending with the dry ingredients and beating well after
each addition. Divide the batter equally between the two pans,
smoothing the tops. Bake the layers uncovered for 30 to 35 minutes,
or until the layers feel spongy to the touch and begin to pull away
from the sides of the pans. Cool the layers upright in their pans on
wire racks for 10 minutes, then carefully loosen them around the
edges with a spatula and turn them onto wire racks. Cool them
completely.

FOR THE FROSTING: Cream the butter until it is light, then add the
confectioners' sugar gradually, beating all the while. Beat in the
melted chocolate and vanilla, then add just enough cream to make the
frosting a good consistency for spreading. Sandwich the two cake
layers together with frosting, then frost the top and sides of the
cake. Swirl the frosting into peaks and valleys. Makes about 8
servings.

confectioners' sugar gradually, beating all the while. Beat in the
melted chocolate and vanilla, then add just enough cream to make the
frosting a good consistency for spreading. Sandwich the two cake
layers together with frosting, then frost the top and sides of the
cake. Swirl the frosting into peaks and valleys. Makes about 8
servings.

Hyde Park Fudge Cake

cakes, chocolate

5 1/3 ounce bitter chocolate (bakery uses guitt; ard brand)
2/3 cup shortening
2 2/3  eggs (this is right -- comes from c; onversion of recipe)*
1 1/3 cup water
3/4 cup sour milk
1 1/3 teaspoon vanilla
3 cup flour
2 3/4 cup sugar
1 1/3 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/3 teaspoon salt
1  icing:
3/4 cup sugar
6 tablespoon evaporated milk
3 ounce chocolate, unsweetened
1 1/2 teaspoon butter

*Whether home cooks throw in that extra 1/3 egg is up to them, but
baker and Rio Grande store manager Janine Gwaltney believes it makes a
difference.  "Too much egg and the cake falls in the center," she
says.

Grease a Bundt pan.  Dust with fine bread crumbs and chill.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Melt the chocolate with the shortening.

Combine eggs, water, milk, and vanilla.  Blend well. Mix flour, sugar,
soda, and salt thoroughly. (If you don't, the flour will clump in the
batter.) Gradually add dry ingredients to liquid ingredients,
blending on low speed of mixer until just mixed, scraping bowl well.
Pour into pan and bake until done, 50-65 minutes. Cool in the pan 30
minutes. Turn out on a cake rack and glaze with icing.

Icing:  While cake is cooling, heat the sugar in the evaporated milk
in the top of a double boiler until the sugar is dissolved. (The
mixture will not feel grainy when rubbed between the fingers.) Melt
butter and chocolate together.  Combine with chocolate mixture. You
may add one to two teaspoon hot water to the icing to enhance the sheen.
Pour icing over the cake.

Tunnel Of Fudge Cake

cakes, chocolate

3 1/2  sticks butter or margarine, softene; d (14 oz)
1 3/4 cup sugar
6  eggs
2 3/4 cup powdered sugar
2 1/4 cup flour
1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 cup chopped walnuts (8 ounce.) **
1 1/2 tablespoon (to 2 tablespoon.) milk

"In 1966 a chocolate cake called the Tunnel of Fudge Cake, made with a
boxed frosting mix, won the Pillsbury BAKE-OFF Contest. Although the
frosting mix was discontinued, Pillsbury continued to receive so many
requests for the cake that the company developed a scratch recipe to
simulate the original.  Here it is:"

1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Grease a 12-cup bundt pan or 10"
angel food tube pan.  Dust with flour; tap out excess. 2. In a large
bowl, beat together butter and sugar with an electric mixer on medium
speed until light and fluffly, 1 to 2 minutes. Add eggs, one at a
time, beating well after each addition. Gradually add 2 cups powdered
sugar, beating until well blended.  By hand, stir in flour, 3/4 cup
cocoa, and nuts; mix until well blended. Spoon batter into prepared
pan and spread evenly. 3. Bake 58 to 62 minutes.  Since this cake has
a soft tunnel of fudge, ordinary doneness test cannot be used.
Accurate oven temperature and baking time are critical.  Let cake
cool upright in pan on a rack for 1 hour; then invert onto serving
plate and let cool completely. 4. To make glaze, in a small bowl,
combine remaining 3/4 cup powdered sugar, remaining 1/4 cup cocoa,
and milk. Mix until well blended. Spoon glaze over top of cool cake,
allowing some to run down sides. Store cake tightly covered.

** Nuts are essential for the success of this recipe.

1 1/2 cup flour -- sifted
1/4 cup cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup water
1/3 cup cooking oil
1 tablespoon vinegar
1 teaspoon vanilla

INSTRUCTIONS: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Arrange 24 cupcake liners
in muffin tins or liberally grease a cake/bundt pan. Blend together

cakes, chocolate

      ----CAKE----
3/4 cup water
1 tablespoon instant coffee granules
6 ounce unsweetened chocolate,
1 coarsely chopped
3 tablespoon honey
2 cup sifted unbleached
1 all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon freshly ground
1 black pepper
8 tablespoon (1 stic unsalted butter,
1 softened and cut into 1pieces
1/4 cup solid vegetable shortening
2 cup superfine granulated sugar
4 large eggs, at room temperature
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup ice water
      ----GANACHE GLAZE----
2  3 -ounce bars swiss dark
1  chocolate, such as lindt
6 ounce heavy cream
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
1 tablespoon grand marnier, cointreau
1 or dark rum
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon hot water, if needed

MAKE THE CAKE: 1. Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and
preheat to 350 degrees.  Butter a 12 cup fluted tube pan. Dust with
flour and tap out the excess. 2. In a small saucepan, bring the 3/4
cup water to a boil. Immediately remove from the heat and stir in the
coffee until disolved.  Add the chocolate and honey and whisk until
the chocolate is melted and the mixture thickens. Let cool for 10 to
15 minutes, until tepid. 3. In a medium bowl, using a wire whisk,
stir together the flour, baking soda, salt and pepper, until
throughly blended. 4. In a 4 1/2 quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric
mixer using the paddle attachment, beat the butter at medium speed
for 30 to 45 seconds, until creamy and smooth. Add the vegetable
shortening. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat for 30 seconds
longer. 5. Add the sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, taking 8 to 10
minutes to blend well.  If using a hand mixer, take at least 15
minutes to blend well. Scrape the sides of the bowl occasionally. 6.
Add the eggs, one at a time at 1 minute intervals.  Reduce the speed
to medium. Stir the chocolate/honey mixture once or twice, then add
to the batter along with the vanilla, scraping the side of the bowl
as necessary. Beat 30 seconds longer. 7.  At low speed, one-third at
a time, beat in the flour mixture alternately with the ice water. Mix
briefly just until each addition is barely incorporated into the
batter.  Scrape down the side of the bowl and mix the batter 10 more
seconds. 8. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the
surface with the back of a spoon. Center the pan on the rack and bake
for 65 to 75 minutes, until the cake begins to come away from the
side of the pan and a wooden toothpick inserted into the center comes
out clean. 9. Set the cake onto a wire rack to cool for 15 to 20
minutes. Invert the cake onto the rack and remove the pan. Cool
completely. MAKE THE GANACHE GLAZE: 10. Break the chocolate bars into
1-inch pieces and place them in a food processor fitted with the
metal chopping blade. Process for 15 to 25 seconds, until finely
chopped. Empty the chocolate into a medium bowl. 11. In a small
saucepan, heat the cream and corn syrup on low heat until it comes to
a gentle boil. Immediately pour the hot cream over the chocolate.
Let the mixture stand for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Gently
whisk until smooth.  Stir in the liqueur or rum and vanilla. If the
surface is oily, stir in 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of hot water. 12. Put the
wire rack with the cake over a baking sheet.  Pour the chocolate
glaze over the top of the cake.  Let the glaze drip down the sides of
the cake without coating it completely. Lift up the rack with the
cake and transfer it to another baking sheet.  Put the baking sheet
with the cake in the refrigerator to chill for 5 to 10 minutes to set
the glaze. 13. Store the cake at room temperature under a glass cover
or in an airtight container for up to 5 days.

Chocolate & Chestnut Loaf

cakes, deserts

15 1/2 ounce can unsweetened chestnut
1  puree
6 ounce unsalted (sweet) butter
4 ounce castor sugar (v. fine grain)
8 ounce darkest plain chocolate
2 tablespoon brandy
1  piped cream (optional)
1  maron glace (optional)

Recommended to make 1 day ahead.

Melt Chocolate (this should be at least 55% cocoa - 75% is great!).

Put better in bowl. Beat until pale and creamy. Add sugar and beat
until fluffy andf light. Add chestnut puree and beat until thoroughly
blended and smooth. (a mixer is so much easier!!! I didn't have one
and found the best way to make sure it wasn't lumpy was to press the
puree through a sieve first - interesting texture!).

Add melted chocolate, brandy and 1 tb of water. Mix thoroughly.

Brush a 2lb bread tin lightly with oil and line with greaseproof
paper and brush LIGHTLY with oil.

Put mixture into tin - flatten top and place lightly oiled greaseproof
paper on top. Cover tin with foil and refigerate for at least 8 hours.

Serve straight from fridge optionally decorated with piped cream
and/or maron glace.

Note: This is a VERY rich desert; a 3/4 inch slice is usually enough!

Chocolate Buttermilk Cake

cakes, chocolate

3 cup flour
1 1/4 cup cocoa
1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 1/4 cup buttermilk
1 1/2 cup thick sour cream
1 1/2 tablespoon instant coffee crystals
2 cup sweet butter
2 1/4 cup sugar
2 1/4 cup 10x powdered sugar
3  eggs
2 1/4 cup heavy cream

THE CAKE: Preheat oven to 350øF.  Grease 3 round, 9" cake pans. Line
bottoms with greased wax paper. Sift together flour, 3/4 c cocoa,
baking soda, baking powder and cinnamon. Mix in buttermilk and coffee
(dissolve coffee in an equal amount of hot water first.) Cream 1 1/2
c butter with the sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a
time until thick. Beating on low speed, slowly mix in buttermilk
mixture. Beat 'til well blended.  Bake about 35 minutes, or until a
straw comes out clean. Remove to racks to cool. After they are
cooled, put in 'fridge'. After 1 hour in 'fridge', split each in half
(see note at bottom.) Wrap each layer in wax paper or plastic wrap,
and freeze immediately. SOUR CREAM FILLING: Beat 3/4 c heavy cream,
gradually adding 3/4 c 10x sugar until stiff. Gently fold in 3/4 c
sour cream. Set aside in 'fridge' (covered.) CHOCOLATE SOUR CREAM
FROSTING: Melt remaining (1/2 c) butter.  Add 1/2 c 10x sugar and
remaining (1/2 c) cocoa.  Stir with a wire whisk over low heat until
smooth; cool. Beat remaining (1 1/2 c) heavy cream; add remaining (1
1/2 c) 10x sugar until soft peaks form.  Add cooled chocolate
mixture; beat until stiff. Fold in remaining (3/4 c) sour cream.
CONSTRUCTION: Build layers from the bottom up as follows: Cake, 1/3
the filling, cake, 2/3 c frosting. Repeat above twice, for total of
six layers. Put remaining frosting on sides. Chill two hours before
serving. Note: The cakes must be well-chilled before assembly, or
they will disintegrate under their own weight during assembly. If the
cake tops rose during baking, the layers will not stack well. You
will need to slice the excess off *after* chilling, but *before*
splitting into layers. Source: Someone named Judith Olney, I'm sure.

3/4 cup cocoa
4  egg; beaten
1 cup milk
2 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon ; water
      ----ICING----
2 1/2 cup sugar
1 1/4 cup milk

2 1/2 tablespoon butter

Cake:  Cream together the shortening and sugar, and add the cocoa. In
a separate bowl, beat the eggs well and add to the cocoa mixture. Add
the milk and flour alternately; dissolve the baking soda in the water
and add. Beat all ingredients well.  Line two lightly greased layer
cake pans with a layer of kitchen parchment (or even cut-up grocery
bags will work). Pour batter into pans evenly, and bake at 350 F.
until the cake leaves the edges of the pans and springs back when
touched. Invert pans on a wire rack to cool.

Icing:  Mix the cocoa and sugar; add the milk.  Add the melted butter
and cook to the soft ball stage in a double boiler (234 F to 240 F).
Remove from the heat and beat until icing thickens and begins to
wrinkle at the edges.  Let cool completely and then ice as for a
normal layer cake.

Chocolate Coffee Cream Roll

cakes, chocolate

2 tablespoon unsalted butter
5 large eggs, separated
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1/3 cup plus 2 tb unsweetened cocoa
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1  coffee cream filling
1 1/2 cup milk
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon cold water
3  egg yolks
1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
2 tablespoon instant coffee powder
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup heavy cream

Rich and delectable, this showy dessert makes an elegant finale to any
dinner. The coffee and cream flavors are the perfect complement to the
chocolate sponge roll.

1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400
degrees F. Lightly grease a 17-by-11-inch jelly roll pan. Line with
waxed paper and grease and lightly flour the paper.

2. Prepare the chocolate roll. Melt the butter in a small pan and let
it cool slightly. In a medium-sized bowl stir together the flour, 1/3
cup of the cocoa, and the baking powder.

3. In another medium-size bowl whisk together the 5 egg yolks, 1/4
cup of the sugar, and the melted butter until light, about 1 minute.
Whisk in the vanilla. With a spoon, stir in about half of the dry
ingredients.

4. In a large, deep bowl combine the egg whites and salt; with an
electric mixer, beat until soft peaks just begin to form. Gradually
beat in the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, beating just until stiff, glossy
peaks form.

5. Fold about one-fourth (or a large spoonful) of the egg whites into
the egg yolk mixture to lighten. Turn this mixture into the bowl of
egg whites and partially fold together. Sift the remaining dry
ingredients over the top and quickly and gently but thoroughly fold
together until no streaks remain. Quickly spread in the prepared pan
and bake 10 to 12 minutes, just until the center top springs back
when lightly touched.

6. Sift the remaining 2 tablespoons of cocoa onto a clean kitchen
towel. Invert the cake onto it and peel off the paper (if it has
stuck or is stubborn, lightly brush the paper with water before
peeling off). With a long, sharp knife or a serrated knife, trim away
about 1/2 inch from each edge. Start along one long side, roll up,
jelly roll fashion. Wrap in the towel and let cool to room
temperature.

7. While roll cools, prepare the coffee cream. In a medium-sized
saucepan over low heat, scald the milk until tiny bubbles appear
around the edges of the surface. Place 1 tablespoon cold water in a
cup and sprinkle the gelatin over it. Let soften until needed.

8. In a medium-sized bowl stir together the sugar, flour, and salt.
Gradually whisk in the scalded milk. Place in a heavy medium-sized
saucepan over moderately low heat and, stirring constantly, cook
until the mixture thickens and comes to a simmer. Whisk in the egg
yolks and continue cooking and stirring until the mixture comes to a
boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the coffee powder and
dissolved gelatin until smooth; stir in the vanilla. Turn into a
shallow bowl, cover with plastic wrap or waxed paper placed directly
on the surface, and cool just to room temperature.

9. Assemble the roll. Using chilled bowl and beaters, whip the cream
until stiff. Give the coffee cream filling a good stir and fold in
about one-fourth of the whipped cream to lighten. Turn the lightened
coffee filling into the whipped cream and fold together.

10. Carefully unroll the chocolate cake onto a board. Spread all of
the coffee cream over it, making it thicker along the side where you
will begin to reroll and leaving about 1 inch uncoated along the
other long side. Reroll the chocolate cake to enclose the filling.
Leave it on the board, seam side down, cover, and chill until set, at
least 4 hours or overnight. Trim the ends and cut into slices. Serve
cold.

Chocolate Fantasy Cake

cakes, no bake

      ----CAKE----
1 pound tea biscuits (dry cookies)
3 tablespoon liqueur (chocolate or coffee flavor; ed)
3 tablespoon brandy
2 1/2 cup cream
3 cup milk
3 pkg chocolate pudding (instant)
1 pinch salt
      ----FROSTING----
4 ounce chocolate, bittersweet
4 ounce chocolate, milk

Arrange a layer of biscuits at the bottom of a large baking pan.

Mix the brandy and liqueur in a small container and pour on top of the
biscuits.  Whip the cream, milk, pudding and salt until the mixture is
thick. Pour the mixture on top of the biscuits. Chill well. When the
cream is cold, prepare the frosting by grating the chocolate onto the
top of the cake. Refrigerate before serving.

NOTES:

*  A no-bake chocolate cake -- This is a very simple, quick, no-bake
cake for those of us who hate getting near an oven, but like
delightful cheese cakes. This recipe is originally from the _Yediot
Achronot_ (Latest News) newspaper supplement here in Israel. It
should be prepared a day or two before you intend to eat it, so that
the flavoring fills out. Definitely not for people on a diet. Yield:
Serves 6-8.

*  You can replace the milk and cream with about 1 1/2 pound of 9
percent milk fat cheese.  This is a product sold in Israel. The
nearest equivalent in North America is sour cream. If you do this,
replace the pudding with about 1/2 cup of chocolate syrup. If you are
not a chocolate lover, you may replace the chocolate pudding with
vanilla pudding (or with vanilla extract if you are using the 9
percent cheese)

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, several hours chilling.
: Precision:  measure the ingredients.

Chocolate Intemperance

cakes, chocolate

1 1/2  pounds, semisweet chocolate
3  eggs, seperated
1/2 cup strong coffee
1/2 cup tia maria
2 tablespoon sugar
1/2 cup heavy cream
1  cake:
23 ounce brownie mix
2 tablespoon water
3  eggs
1  glaze:
8 ounce semisweet chocolate chips
1/3 cup water

Serves: 8 to 10

This mousse-filled, chocolate-swathed mold is an embarrassment of
riches. When served to chocolate lovers, the only sound in the room
will be faint moans of pure, unadulterated decadent pleasure.

Filling:

Melt chocolate with coffee on top of a double boiler. When chocolate
is completely melted, remove pan from heat. Beat egg yolks until pale
yellow and stir into chocolate. Gradually stir in Tia Maria. Cool
mixture.

In a seperate bowl, beat egg whites, gradually adding sugar until
whites are stiff. Whip cream. Gently fold whipped cream into cooled
chocolate mixture and then fold in egg whites.

Preheat oven to 350.  Beat ingredients together at medium speed of
electric mixer until batter is smooth. Grease an 11-by-15 inch
jellyroll pan. Line it with waxed paper. Grease and lightly flower
paper, shaking off any excess flower.  Spread batter evenly in
jellyroll pan. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until cake tests done.
Turn cake onto a rack and peel off paper. Lightly oil a 2-quart
charlotte mold and line with cooled cake. Cut rounds of cake to fit
both top and bottom of mold, and a strip for sides. Place smaller
round in bottom of mold. (you will probably have to piece one section
of side to cover completely, but don't worry; any patchwork will be
hidden by chocolate glaze.) Fit larger round of cake on top of mold.
Chill for 3 or 4 hours or until firm. Unmold and cover with glaze.

Melt chocolate in water and stir until smooth.  Spread over top of
mousse-cake and drizzle down sides.  Chill again. Serve in slender
slices ~- its indecently opulent.

Hints: Melt chocolate in microwave. Its much faster. Instructions are
on the chocolate package.

A souffle dish makes a good replacement for the Charlotte mold.

Melt butter in microwave, stir it, make sure it's not too hot. Stir
in egg thoroughly, add to cake mix, stir up into a cookie dough. All
dry ingredients should be moistened.

At this point you can use it or wrap it airtight and store in fridge
up to a couple of weeks.

Scoop about a heaping teaspoon full and mould it around a chocolate
mint wafer.  If you have a gem pan (shallow muffin tin), put them
into the depressions. Bake at 350 degrees, check after 9 minutes.
("Cook at moderate heat until done.")

Cool completely in pan, remove with plastic fork. Will make more than
4 dozen.  --Jocelyn "Mom" Baden, Costa Mesa CA

[I haven't tried this yet myself; when I went down to TJ's they were
out of the chocolate mint UFOs, and we don't keep cake mix in the
house. Mom vouches for it as a great treat to keep on hand for
cooking in the toaster-oven; the gem pan holds 6 cookies and fits
neatly on the rack.]

Chocolate Mosaic Fruit Tart

cakes, chocolate

      ----CHOCOLATE TART CRUST----
4 ounce ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1/2 cup slivered almonds
1/2 cup unsifted flour
1/2 cup cold butter, cut up
1/8 teaspoon salt
1  egg
1 teaspoon vanilla
      ----CHOCOLATE TART FILLING----
1/2 cup butter, softened
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1  egg
4 ounce ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate
3 tablespoon heavy whipping cream
1 teaspoon vanilla or grand marnier
1  fresh fruit: strawberries, kiwi, ba; nanas,
1  green grapes, oranges, etc.
1/4 cup apricot jam

Servings: 8

DIRECTIONS: For crust: Place broken chocolate pieces, sugar and
almonds into bowl of processor or blender. Process for about 20 to 25
seconds until the mixture is like powder. On top of chocolate mixture
in food processor, spread flour, butter and salt. Process 15 to 20
pulses or until butter is in very fine pieces. (Or butter may be cut
into flour by hand using a pastry cutter, then combined with
chocolate.) Add egg and vanilla. Pulse about 15 times or stir lightly
until mixture sticks together when pinched with fingers. On plastic
wrap, knead a few times to bring dough together to form a ball;
flatten to 8". It is easier to use your fingers to pat the dough into
tart pan than to roll dough. Use a 10 1/2" flat tart pan with 1"
fluted sides. Bake in center of oven at 350-F for 15 to 18 minutes or
until baked shell springs back when touched. (Do not overbake.) Cool.
Remove outside ring of pan. Crust may be prepared a day in advance,
if desired. (MY NOTES: this crust seemed too wet before baking, but
turned out fine after about 16 or 17 minutes baking time. It was like
a brownie crust.)

Chocolate tart filling: In small mixer bowl, beat butter with sugar
and egg; beat until fluffy. Melt broken chocolate in double boiler,
stirring constantly, or microwave on medium for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.
Add warm chocolate to creamed mixture and beat well. Mix in cream and
vanilla, beating until thick and creamy. Spread filling over baked
Chocolate Tart Crust. While filling is still soft, artistically
arrange fruit on top. For fruit glaze, strain apricot jam. With
pastry brush, use glaze to cover pieces of fruit and top edge of
crust. Chill about 2 hours. Decorate with chocolate curls, if
desired. Let stand 30 minutes at room temperature before serving.

Chocolate Nut Cake

cakes, no bake

1/4 pound butter (or margarine)
1 cup icing sugar
2 large eggs
3/4 cup cashews or almonds
2 1/2 teaspoon cocoa
1/2 pound graham crackers
1  milk
3/4 teaspoon vanilla

Cream together the butter and sugar.  Chop the nuts and roast if
desired.

Soak the crackers in the milk until they are soft but have not turned
to mush. Dissolve cocoa in about 2 tablespoon milk, and add this and the
nuts
to the creamed butter/sugar mixture.

Separate the eggs and set the whites aside.  To the creamed mixture
add the yolks and  vanilla and beat. Whip the whites until stiff
peaks form, then fold this into the mixture.

Line a 9-inch square pan with a layer of crackers, mixture, and
crackers. Top with the remaining mixture and set in the refrigerator
until hard.

NOTES:

*  A no-bake graham-cracker chocolate cake -- This is a delicious,
easy-to-make cake that everyone enjoys. It came from an East Indian
friend of mine who said it had been in the family. It seems western
so I am uncertain of its origins.

*  Depending on how you want the texture of the cake you can soak the
crackers until they are slightly softened or until they fall apart.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, several hours chilling.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

Chocolate Orgasms

cakes, chocolate

4 ounce unsweetened chocolate
8 tablespoon unsalted butter, room temp
1 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon. sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 large eggs, room temp
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoon chopped walnuts
1  frosting
1 1/2 ounce unsweetened chocolate
1/4 cup evaporated milk
1/3 cup sugar

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  Lightly grease an 8-inch square pan
with butter or vegetable oil.  Melt the chocolate and butter in the
top of a double boiler placed over simmering water. Cool the mixture
for 5 minutes.

Place the sugar in a medium-size mixing bowl and pour in the chocolate
mixture.  Using an electric mixer on medium speed, mix until blended,
about 25 seconds. Scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the
vanilla. With the mixer on medium-low speed, add the eggs one at a
time, blending after each addition until the yolk is broken and
dispersed, about 10 seconds. Scrape the bowl after the last egg and
blend until velvety, about 15 more seconds.

Add the flour on low speed and mix for 20 seconds; finish the mixing
by hand, being certain to mix in any flour at the bottom of the bowl.
Stir in 1/2 cup of the nuts. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared
pan and sprinkle the remaining 2 Tbsp of nuts over the top. Bake the
brownies on the center oven rack until a thin crust forms on top and
a tester inserted in the center comes out with a moist crumb, about
35 minutes. (The center of the brownies should never quite rise to
the height of the edges.)

Remove pan from oven and place on a rack to cool for 1 hour.

FROSTING: To prepare the frosting, melt the chocolate in the top of a
double boiler placed over simmering water. Pour the evaporated milk
into an electric blender and add the sugar and the melted chocolate.
Blend the frosting on medium-low speed until it thickens, about 50
seconds (the sound of the machine will change when this process
occurs.)

Using a frosting spatula, spread the frosting evenly over the surface
of the cooled brownies and allow them to sit for 1 hour before
cutting. Makes 36 small brownies.

cakes, chocolate, godiva

1  milk chocolate layer:
6 ounce swiss milk chocolate --
1  coarsely chopped
3/4 cup creamy peanut butter
2 tablespoon peanut oil
1 1/3 cup crushed chocolate laced --
1  pirouette cookies (s

1  bittersweet chocolate
1  layer:
6 ounce swiss dark chocolate --
1  coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon peanut oil
1 1/4 cup heavy cream
1  cocoa powder to dust top

Make the milk chocolate layer: Line an 8-inch square baking pan with
plastic wrap, leaving a 2-inch overhang

on two sides. Melt the milk chocolate according to the melting
instructions in the Chocolate Key. In a medium bowl, using a
hand-held electric mixer, beat the peanut butter and oil on medium
speed until smooth. Beat in the cookie crumbs and chocolate. Scrape
the chocolate mixture into the prepared pan. Spread with a rubber
spatula in an even layer. Tap the pan on the counter to remove any
air bubbles. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and freeze 20 minutes or
until firm. Make the bittersweet chocolate layer:

Melt the dark chocolate according to the melting instructions in the
Chocolate Key. Transfer the chocolate to a large bowl. Stir in the
oil. In a chilled large bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer, beat
the cream on high speed just until soft mounds begin to form. (Do not
overwhip the cream. ) Using a rubber spatula, quickly fold 1/2 of the
whipped cream into the chocolate mixture to lighten it. Fold in the
remaining cream. Scrape the bittersweet chocolate mixture over the
milk chocolate layer. Spread in an even layer. Tap the pan on the
counter to remove any air bubbles. Cover the pan with plastic wrap
and refrigerate at least 6 to 8 hours. (The cake may be prepared 2
days in advance. ) Unmold the cake: Using the plastic wrap as
handles, lift the cake from the pan. Slide the cake off the plastic
wrap onto a cutting board. Dust the top of the cake with cocoa
powder, if desired. Using a long sharp knife dipped in hot water and
wiped dry, cut the cake into 1-inch strips. Cut each strip in half to
make eight 4-by-1-inch bars. Allow the bars to stand at room
temperature before serving. Arrange 2 bars on each dessert plate.

remaining 4 tablespoon of melted butter.  Beat until the batter is smooth.
Pour over the pecan mixture in pan.  Bake at 350 degrees for about 30
minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Cover with a large plate and flip.  Tap  plate and pan firmly on the
counter. Remove cake pan and scrape any remaining topping onto the
cake.

Serve warm  with ice cream.  It is good without the ice cream but I
serve it with vanilla ice cream scoops that are dusted with cocoa or
with a bit of warm caramel topping garnished with pecans. Utterly
disgraceful decadence!

If you don't like coconut, omit it and use a extra 1/2 C of pecans.

1/4 teaspoon baking powder
6 large eggs, at room temperature
      ----PUDDING----

1 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
      ----SAUCE----
1 cup (1/2 pint) heavy cream
1 1/2 cup (about 8 ounce) chopped bittersweet; ocolate
2 tablespoon grand marnier or other orange-flavo; red liqueur

1. Day before serving, prepare and assemble Chocolate Cake and Pud-
ding. To prepare Chocolate Cake, grease a 10-inch springform pan;
sprinkle inside greased pan with 2 tablespoons sugar. In medium-size
bowl, sift together flour, cocoa, and baking powder; set aside.

2. Heat oven to 350F. In large bowl, with electric mixer, beat eggs
and rema@g 3/4 C sugar until double in volume 5 minutes. To prepare
cake batter, gently fold flour mixture into egg mixture just until
combined. Pour batter into prepared springform pan and bake cake 20
to 25 minutes or until center springs back when gently pressed with
fingertip.

3. Cool cake in pan on wire rack 10 minutes. Remove cake from pan and
cool completely on wire rack.

4. To prepare Pudding, in 2-quart saucepan, heat cream to boiling. In
large bowl, with wire whisk, beat egg yolks and sugar until well com-
bined. Slowly beat hot cream into yolk mixture and pour all back into
saucepan. Cook cream mixture over low heat until pudding coats a
spoon. (Do not boil.) Remove pudding from heat and stir in chocolate
chips until mixture is smooth. Cool to room temperature.

5. To assemble Chocolate Pudding Cake, cut cake horizontally into 3
equal slices. Line inside of cleaned springform pan with aluminum
foil. Place top layer of cake in bottom of springform pan. Pour
one-third of pudding over cake layer in pan. Top with middle cake
layer and half of remaining pudding. Place bottom cake layer, bottom
side up, in pan and top with remaining pudding. Cover loosely with

refriger- ate until well chilled.

8. Just before serving, prepare Sauce: In 2-quart saucepan, heat
cream to boiling. Remove pan from heat and stir in chocolate and

prepare Chocolate Curls.

9. To serve, remove side of springform pan and slice cake into wedges;
place each wedge onto dessert plate. Top cake wedges with chocolate
sauce and Chocolate Curls, if desired.

Making Chocolate Curls

Leave block or square of white or semisweet chocolate in warm room
(800 to 85'F) for several hours or heat, repeatedly, in microwave
oven 7 to 8 seconds just enough to soften chocolate slightly). Place
softened square or block against paper towel in one hand; using a
sharp vegetable peeler, dig one blade into edge or side of chocolate
(depending on how wide you want your curls) and bring peeler towards
you; chocolate should come off in curls. If chocolate is too cold it
will splinter; if too warm it will not curl.

Chocolate Triple Layer Cake With Fluffy Choco

cakes, chocolate, low fat

1 ounce unsweetened chocolate
2 cup cake flour
6 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup vegetable oil
2 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter, slightly softened
1 1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 large egg
4  egg whites
1/4 cup room-temperature coffee
2 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup plain nonfat yogurt
2 tablespoon plain nonfat yogurt
      ----FLUFFY CHOCOLATE FROSTING----
3 large egg whites
1/2 ounce unsweetened chocolate
2 1/2 tablespoon light corn syrup
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 pinch salt
3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon instant coffee powder
1 teaspoon hot water
1/4 cup powdered sugar
3 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder

Preheat oven to 350'F. Grease (or spray with non-stick cooking spray)
three 8" or 8 1/2" round cake pans.

In a small, heavy saucepan over lowest heat, melt chocolate, stirring
constantly until smooth; be careful not to scorch. Set aside. Sift
together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt
onto a sheet of wax paper. In a large mixer bowl, with mixer set on
medium speed, beat oil, butter and sugar until very well blended and
fluffy. Beat in chocolate. One at a time, beat in egg, then whites,
coffee and vanilla until smoothly incorporated. Gently stir half of
the dry ingredients, then yogurt into the mixture just until mixed.
Stir in remaining dry ingredients just until well blended and smooth.
Divide batter among pans, spreading in edges.

Bake in the middle of the oven for 23-28 minutes, or until tops are
almost firm when tapped and a toothpick inserted in the center comes
out moist but clean. Transfer pans to racks and let stand until
completely cooled. Layers may be wrapped airtight and frozen for
later use. Let return to room temperature before using. Or frost cake
and serve immediately, if desired. Makes 10-12 servings.

Nutritional information (with fluffy chocolate frosting): Each serving
contains 342 calories, 10 grams of fat, 2 grams of saturated fat, 25
milligrams of cholesterol, 202 milligrams of sodium. Percentage of
calories from fat: 26.

FLUFFY CHOCOLATE FROSTING: Place egg whites in a large mixer bowl.
Set the bowl in a large bowl of very hot tap water and let stand for
10 minutes, stirring occasionally. In a small heavy saucepan set over
low heat, melt chocolate, stirring constantly, until smooth; be very
careful not to scorch. Set aside to cool slightly.

Combine the corn syrup, 1/4 cup water and the sugar in a 2-quarter
saucepan, stirring until well blended. Bring to a simmer over
medium-heat heat. Cover and boil for 2 minutes to allow steam to wash
any sugar from pan sides. Uncover and continue simmering, without
stirring, until mixture bubbles loudly and reaches 244-245'F on a
candy thermometer (about 1 1/2 minutes). (To test without a candy
thermometer, drop a teaspoon of syrup into ice water; when cooked to
the proper temperature the syrup will form a firm ball that holds its
shape when squeezed.) Immedately remove pan from heat and set aside.

With mixer set on medium speed, beat egg whites until very frothy and
opaque. Raise speed to high and beat until whites just begin to stand
in soft peaks; be careful not to overbeat. Meanwhile, return syrup to
burner and reheat just to boiling. Beating whites on high speed,
immediately begin pouring boiling syrup in a stream down the side of
the bowl (avoid beaters or syrup will stick to them or be thrown onto
bowl side), pouring rapidly enough that all the syrup is incorporated
in about 15 seconds. Add salt and continue beating on high speed
until the mixture is stiffened, glossy and cooled to barely warm.
Beat in vanilla and coffee mixture until evenly incorporated. Sift
powdered sugar and cocoa onto a sheet of wax paper. A bit at a time,
whisk into egg-white mixture. Whisk in melted chocolate just until
smoothly incorporated.

Frost cake immediately, or store frosting airtight for up to 48 hours.
Frosting may soften and gradually deflate upon longer standing.

16 ounce semi-sweet chocolate
1/2 cup sweet butter
1 1/2 teaspoon flour
1 1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon hot water
4  eggs, separated

Oil bottom of 8 or 9-inch springform pan.  Melt chocolate and butter
( I did this in a saucepan, although the original recipe calls for it
being done in a 200-degree oven.). Add flour, sugar, and water; blend
well. Add egg yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition.
In a separate bowl ( a metal one!) beat egg whites until stiff. Fold
gently into chocolate mixture. Turn into prepared pan and bake for 15
minutes in middle of 425 degree oven (I found that in the 9-inch pan,
I needed to extend this to 25 minutes for it to be completely
cooked.). Let cake cool completely. Sift or sprinkle powdered sugar
over top of cooled cake.

2 tablespoon cocoa (rounded t's)
1  grated rind of 1 orange
4  eggs
1/2 cup guinness
      ----ICING----
4 ounce butter
8 ounce confectioners' sugar
1  orange(juice, grated rind)

Preheat oven to 375F.  Grease 2 8-9-inch cake pans. Cream the butter
and sugar until light and fluffy. Sift the flour, baking powder, salt
and cocoa into a bowl. Add the orange rind to the creamed butter and
beat in the eggs, one at a time, including a spoonful of the measured
flour mixture with each one, and beating well between additions.
Gently mix in the Guinness, a tablespoonful at a time, including
another spoonful of flour with each addition.  If there's any flour
left over, fold it in gently to mix;  blend thoroughly without
over-beating. Divide the mixture between the tins, smooth down, and
put the cakes into the center of the preheated oven. Reduce the heat
to moderate (350F) and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the cakes are
springy to the touch and shrinking slightly in the pans. Turn out and

Double-Chocolate Rum Cake

cakes, deserts

1 pkg chocolate cakemix (18 1/2oz)
1 pkg instant chocolate pudding
4  eggs
1 cup dark rum
3/4 cup water plus 1 teaspoon
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 pkg chocolate chips
1  jar raspberry prserves 10 o
2 tablespoon shortening
1 ounce vanilla baking bar

My Grandmother's recipe calls for greasing a 10 in tube pan. I use a
12-cup bundt pan with excellent results. 1.Combine cake mix, pudding
mix, eggs, 1/2 c of the rum, 3/4 c of the water and the oil in a
large mixing bowl. Beat at low speed until ingrediants are moistened.
Then two minutes at medium speed. Stir in 1 cup of the chocolate
chips. Pout batter into prepared pan. Bake 50 to 60 minutes. Cool in
pan 15 minutes. Remove from pan, finish cooling on a wire rack. 2.In
a small saucepan, heat preserves and remaining 1/2 c rum to make
glaze. Strain through sieve to remove seeds. Place cake on serving
plate. Prick the surface of the cake with a fork, or a tooth pick. (I
use this time to vent frustations) Brush the raspberry glaze evenly
over the cake. Use all the glaze. It does take a few minutes to do
this. Just make sure its evenly applied. 3.In a bowl, combine
remaining 1 c of chocolate chips and shortening. Microwave on high 1
minute. (I know, my Grandma never had a Microwave, I just updated the
recipe, because in this case the technology makes this process
painless and quick, and I'm less likely to burn the chocolate.) Stir
to make a smooth icing. Drizzle chocolate icing over the cake. Let
stand about 15 minutes. 4.In a small bowl, combine vanilla baking bar
and remaining 1 teaspoon of water. Microwave on high 30 seconds (or
until melted). Drizzle vanilla icing over the chocolate icing.
Grandma always served this tasty morsel with very strong coffee.

Flourless Foolproof Fabulous Chocolate Cake

cakes, chocolate

10 ounce chocolate, bittersweet
1/2 cup butter, sweet; softened
1/2 cup sugar
5  egg; separated
2 tablespoon rum, dark
1/3 cup walnuts; chopped
2 1/2 cup creme ganache (below)
3 cup english toffee; crushed (below)
      ----CREME GANACHE----
1 quart heavy cream
2 pound bittersweet chocolate
      ----ENGLISH TOFFEE----
3 cup walnuts; chopped
3 cup sugar
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup light karo
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cup butter, sweet

Preheat the oven to 325.

Butter an 8-inch cake pan and line the bottom with parchment
paper. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler. Beat the butter with
1/4 cup of the sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg yolks, two
at a time, and then the rum, then the walnuts, beating well each time.

In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites and the rest of the sugar
until they are stiff and shiny.  Add the melted chocolate to the
butter mixture and combine well. Fold in the egg whites and combine
well, until there are no more white streaks.  Pour the mixture into
the cake pan and bake about 25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in
the center comes out with a few crumbs.

Cool the cake and then chill.

Whip 2 1/2 cups of ganache until light and fluffy. Smooth a
little of the ganache on top of the chilled cake. Sprinkle crushed
toffee on top of the cake, and then cover the whole thing, top and
sides, with ganache and chill for two hours.

Serve the cake at room temperature.

Ganache: Bring the cream to a boil in a 6-quart pot. When the
cream boils, remove it from the heat immediately and add all the
chocolate at once. Stir with a wire whisk until the chocolate is all
melted. Pour into a bowl, allow to cool at room temperature, cover
with plastic wrap, and chill. You can keep in the refrigerator for a
week or in the freezer for several months.

Toffee:  Preheat the oven to 175. Put nuts on a cookie sheet and
place in the oven to keep warm. Coat another cookie tray with
vegetable oil.

Put the sugar, water, corn syrup, and vanilla in a heavy
saucepan and stir well to dissolve the sugar. Wash down the sides of
the pan with a pastry brush dipped in cold water so that there is no
sugar clinging to the sides of the pan. Cook over high heat until it
reaches a boil, continuing to wash down with water. After it has
boiled for one minute, add the butter, stirring often. It is done
when it registers 290 on a candy thermometer and it is the color of a
brown paper bag. Remove from heat and stir in the walnuts. Pour the
mixture onto the oiled sheet and let it cool completely.

French Chocolate Layer Cake

cakes, eggs, spreads

      ----CAKE----
2 teaspoon espresso coffee, instant
1/4 cup water, hot
7 ounce chocolate, semisweet
2 ounce chocolate, bitter
4  eggs, separated
4 ounce butter
2/3 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
3/4 cup cornstarch, sifted
      ----FROSTING----
2 teaspoon espresso coffee, instant
7 ounce chocolate, semisweet
2 ounce chocolate, bitter
2 tablespoon butter

Combine espresso, hot water, semisweet chocolate and bitter chocolate in
double boiler filled with hot water and cover.  Without applying additional
heat, melt the chocolate.

Butter two layer-cake pans, lay a sheet of waxed paper in each, and dust
the pans with flour. (The pans should be able to hold about 4 cups each.)

Beat the egg yolks and then gradually add about 2/3 cup of sugar until the
yolks are thick and lemon colored.

Beat butter into the chocolate mixture.  Add the chocolate mixture to the
egg yolks and stir.

Beat the egg whites until foamy.  Add the cream of tartar, and then
gradually add up to 2 tablespoon sugar.

Add the sifted corn starch gradually to the chocolate mixture, alternating
with the egg whites.  The corn starch and egg whites should be folded in to
the chocolate mixture.

Pour half the batter into each cake pan.  Bake on the lower middle level of
a preheated 350 degree F. oven until set on the sides. Cool the cake in the
pan, and then turn out onto a serving dish.

Combine the icing ingredients and ice the cake as you would a normal layer
cake.

NOTES:

*  A decadently rich chocolate cake -- My mother got this recipe from a
radio show about ten years ago. She was intrigued because the cake contains
no flour. It is definitely for chocoholics. Although it is a two-layer
cake, it is only about 3-4 inches thick when it's done, and has the
consistency and density of a chocolate candy bar. It can be frozen if you
find it too much to eat at one time.

German White Chocolate Cake

cakes, chocolate, german

2 1/2 cup cake flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 pound unsalted butter
1 1/2 cup sugar
4 large eggs, separated
4 ounce white chocolate, melted in 1/2 c bo; iling water and cooled
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup buttermilk
1 cup shredded unsweetened coconut
1 cup chopped pecans
1  frosting
1 cup evaporated milk
1 cup sugar
1/4 pound unsalted butter
3 large egg yolks
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup chopped pecans
1 cup shredded unsweetened coconut

CAKE

1. Position the racks in the upper and lower thirds and preheat oven
to 350 deg F. Lightly butter the bottom and sides of three 8 inch
round cake pans. Line the pans with parchment paper. Dust the bottom
and sides with flour; tap out the excess.

2. Into a medium bowl, sift the cake flour and the baking soda. Using
an electric mixer set at mdeium speed, cream the butter and the sugar
in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in one
egg yolk at a time, blending well after each addition. Beat in the
melted white chocolate mixture and the vanilla. At low speed, blend
in the sifted flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk; do not
overbeat. Fold in the coconut and pecans.

3. Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.  Blend 1/3 of the egg
whites into the cake mixture to lighten it; carefully fold in the
remaining egg whites.  Spoon the batter into the prepared pans.

4. Bake until the cake springs back when touched in the center and a
cake tester inserted in the center of the pans comes out clean, about
35 to 40 minutes. Transfer the cakes in the pans to wire racks and
cool 10 minutes. Invert the cakes onto the wire racks, carefully peel
off the parchment paper, and cool completely.

FOR THE FROSTING:

5. In a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the evaporated
milk, sugar, butter, and egg yolks. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring
constantly. Do not let mixture boil fast; lower the heat if necessary.
Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla, pecans, and coconut. Plance
the saucepan into a bowl filled with ice and stir constantly until
the frosting is cool and slightly thickened.

6. Place a cake layer on a serving platter. Spread 1/4 of the frosting
evenly over the cake layer, making sure to spread it all the way to
the edges. Top with the second layer, and spread with 1/4 of the
frosting. Top with the third cake layer.  Evenly frost the top and
sides of the cake with the remaining frosting.

      ----FOR TORTE----
8 ounce ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate
1/2 cup butter
3/4 cup sugar, divided
6  egg yolks
2 tablespoon grand marnier (orange liqueur)
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 1/3 cup very finely chopped pecans
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
7  egg whites
      ----CHOCOLATE GANACHE GLAZE----
4 ounce ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
2 teaspoon grand marnier (orange liqueur)
1/3 cup very finely chopped pecans
1  grand marnier whipped cream
      ----DECORATION----
3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoon powdered sugar
2 teaspoon grand marnier (orange liqueur)
1  fresh orange, thin skin variety

Servings: 8

DIRECTIONS: Torte: Melt broken chocolate in double boiler, stirring
constantly, or microwave on medium for about 3 minutes. Set aside. In
the small mixer bowl, cream butter, gradually adding 1/2 cup of the
sugar; mix until very fluffy. Add egg yolks, liqueur and vanilla;
beat until creamy. Transfer to larger bowl. Fold melted chocolate
into creamed mixture. Use a food processor or blender to chop pecans
to a coarse powder. Combine nuts with crumbs and fold into chocolate
mixture. Beat egg whites with salt, gradually adding remaining 1/4
cup sugar; beat until soft peaks form. Stir 1/4 of egg whites into
chocolate mixture; fold in remaining egg whites. Pour batter into a
buttered 9" springform pan lined with waxed paper. Bake at 350-F on
bottom rack for 45-50 minutes or until center is firm. Cool on rack.
Cake will sink slightly in the center. Remove pan and liner. Top with
Chocolate Ganache Glaze and Grand Marnier Whipped Cream Decoration.

Chocolate Ganache Glaze: Finely chop chocolate. Heat cream until hot.
On very low heat add chocolate, stirring until smooth and thick.
Remove from heat. Stir in liqueur. Turn torte, top side down, onto
serving plate. Arrange strips of waxed paper under cake edge to catch
excess glaze. Pour glaze over top and sides of cake. After a short
time, run excess glaze up sides of cake. Cover sides of cake with
nuts. Remove waxed paper strips. Chill cake while preparing topping.

Grand Marnier Whipped Cream Decoration: Whip cream with sugar and
liqueur until it holds a shape. Do not overbeat. Pipe rosettes or
form a ring of whipped cream around top of chocolate glazed torte.
With a sharp knife cut peel from orange. Slice into circles; cut into
quarters. Place oranges around cake on top of whipped cream. If
preferred, sprinkle grated orange rind over whipped cream. Cake
should be stored in a cool place until served.

Grandmothers' Chocolate Cake

cakes

1 1/2 cup + 1 tablespoon cocoa powder
1 1/4 cup boiling water
1 1/2 cup cake flour
1 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons all purpose flour
1 liter 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
1 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
5  ounces sweet butter, softened
2 3/4 cup brown sugar
3 large eggs
1 1/4 cup buttermilk
1 1/4 teaspoon vanilla
1  bittersweet chocolate frosting (see; recipe)
      ----BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE FROSTI---
4  ounces bittersweet chocolate
8  ounces unsweetened chocolate
8  ounces sweet butter
3 1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 pinch salt
2 teaspoon vanilla
7/8 cup (1 cup minus 2 tablespoons) milk

Charles Franz requested this cake for his second birthday from Stars'
dessert ace Emily Luchetti.  She says, "Half of this recipe comes
from my grandmother, and the other half from my husband's
grandmother. I grew up eating the chocolate frosting and husband grew
up eating the cake. Put the components together and all that's
missing is a tall glass of milk."

Preheat the oven to 350F.  Butter three 9-inch round cake pans. Whisk
together the cocoa and the boiling water in a bowl, making a smooth
paste. Set aside to cool.

Sift together the cake flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder and
baking soda.

Put the butter and brown sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer. With
the paddle attachment, cream them on medium-high speed for 2 minutes,
until light and fluffy,

Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Decrease
speed to low, and stir in the dry ingredients alternate with the
buttermilk. Stir in the reserved cocoa paste and the vanilla.

Divide the batter evenly among the 3 pans.  Bake for about 25 minutes,
until a cake tester inserted in the middle comes out clean. When the
cakes are cool, unmold them by running a knife around inside edge of
each pan and inverting onto racks.

Fill and frost with Bittersweet Chocolate Frosting, making a 3-layer
cake.

the vanilla and the milk.  Whisk the milk into the powdered sugar.
Add the melted chocolate mixture and stir until smooth.

Hazelnut Meringue With Mocha Filling

cakes, chocolate

1 1/2 cup hazelnuts or almonds, ground
2 tablespoon cornstarch
1 1/2 cup sugar, fine granulated
8  egg whites
2 teaspoon lemon juice

A light, luscious hazelnut meringue cake with chocolate-coffee
filling is a dream dessert after a buffer. To make a taller cake pipe
three 8-inch circles and fill as directed. This looks spectacular but
is harder to cut. Preheat oven to 225F (110C). Line 2 baking sheets
with parchment paper or foil. Draw a 10-inch circle on each sheet.
Turn sheet over so pencil will not come off on meringue. Combine
hazelnut and cornstarch making sure there are no lumps. Place egg
whites in bowl of electric beater and whisk until soft peaks form.
Gradually sprinkle in sugar, beating until stiff peaks form and
mixture is glossy. Beat in lemon juice. Sprindle nut mixture over the
whites and quickly fold in. Either gently spread or pipe meringue
into the two circles. Place in oven and bake for 2 to 2 1/2 hours,
until meringue is dry but not coloured. Cool on baking sheet. Remove
from parchment paper and store at room temperature in an airtight tin
for up to three weeks. MOCHA FILLING: Stir together coffee and Kahlua
until coffee is dissolved. Beat whipping cream until it thickens and
holds its shape. Beat in icing sugar and sifted cocoa. Add coffee
mixture and beat until cream is stiff. Do not overbeat; cream should
be thick and smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use. To assemble,
spread half of cream on one layer. Top with second layer and
remainder of cream. Decorate with chocolate curls, chocolate coated
coffee beans or spread a doily on cream and sifted cocao over.

Ida Hyde's Texas Sheet Cake

cakes, chocolate

      ----CAKE----
2 cup sugar
2 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup margarine (2 sticks)
4 teaspoon cocoa; generous
1 cup ; water
1/2 cup buttermilk
2  egg; beaten
1 pinch salt
      ----FROSTING----
1/2 cup margarine
4 teaspoon cocoa; generous
6 teaspoon buttermilk
1 pound sugar, confectioners
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup nuts; chopped, or to taste

Cake:  In a mixing bowl, mix sugar, flour and soda together. In a
saucepan, melt margarine; stir in cocoa and water and bring to a
boil. Pour hot mixture over dry ingredients; stir well. Mix in
buttermilk, eggs and salt. Pour into a greased jelly roll pan. Bake
at 400 degrees F. for about 15 minutes, until top springs back when
touched.

Frosting: In same saucepan used for cake, melt margarine. Stir in
cocoa and buttermilk and bring to a rapid boil. Remove from heat and
stir in the sugar and vanilla; blend thoroughly. Stir in nuts. Spread
over cake as soon as it comes out of the oven. Be prepared to clean
up some drips.

If there are kids around, let them clean up the drips ~ this frosting
is like fudge! The frosting is so good ~ it's almost like the cake
exists just to give a base to the frosting. Mom cuts the frosting
recipe down (about in half) but I like it just the way it is - lots.

      ----CAKE----
6 large eggs
3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoon instant espresso powder or coffee p; owder
1 pinch salt
1 cup all purpose flour
      ----CHOCOLATE BANDS----
2  waxed (14 1/2 x 3-inch) paper strip; s
4 ounce semisweet chocolate, chopped
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon solid vegetable sho; rtening
      ----CHOCOLATE CURLS----
12  squares (1-ounce) semisweet baking; chocolate
1  powdered sugar

Mousse: Whisk eggs and sugar in large metal bowl. Set bowl over
saucepan of simmering water (do not allow bottom of bowl to touch
water) and whisk constantly until candy thermometer registers 160F.,
about 5 minutes. Remove bowl from over water. Using electric mixer,
beat egg mixture until cool and very thick, about 10 minutes. Place
chocolate in top of double boiler over simmering water; stir until
melted and smooth. Remove chocolate from over water. Cool to luke
warm. Combine cream and Irish cream liqueur in medium bowl; beat to
stiff peaks. Pour luke warm melted chocolate over egg mixture and
fold together. Fold in cream mixture. Cover and chill until set, at
least 4 hours or overnight.

Syrup: Combine sugar and water in small saucepan. Stir over low heat
until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and bring to boil. Remove from
heat. Mix in whiskey. Cool. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and
let stand at room temperature.)

Cake: Preheat oven to 350 B0F. Butter 9-inch-diameter springform pan
with 2-3/4-inch high sides. Line bottom with parchment paper. Using
electric mixer, beat eggs, sugar, espresso powder and salt in large
bowl until mixture thickens and slowly dissolving ribbon forms when
beaters are lifted, about 8 minutes. Sift 1/3 of flour over and
gently fold into egg mixture. Repeat 2 more times (do not overmix or
batter may deflate.) Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake until tester
inserted into center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool cake
completely in pan on rack. Run small sharp knife around pan sides to
loosen cake. Release pan sides. Turn out cake. Remove pan bottom.
Peel off parchment. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Wrap cake in
plastic and chill.)

Assembly: Using serrated knife, cut cake horizontally into 3 layers.
Place bottom cake layer on platter. Brush with 3 tablespoons syrup.
Spread 2 cups mousse over. Top with second cake layer. Brush with 3
tablespoons syrup. Spread 2 cups mousse over. Top with third cake
layer, cut side down. Brush with 3 tablespoons syrup. Spread
remaining mousse over top and sides of cake. Refrigerate cake while
preparing chocolate bands.

Chocolate Bands: Line large baking sheet with foil and set aside.
Place another large sheet of foil on work surface; top with waxed
paper strips, spacing apart. Stir chopped semisweet chocolate and
vegetable shortening in heavy small saucepan over low heat until
melted and smooth. Pour half of melted chocolate down center of each
waxed paper strip. Using metal icing spatula, spread chocolate to
cover strips evenly and completely, allowing some chocolate to extend
beyond edges of paper strips. Using fingertips, lift strips and place
on clean foil-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate just until chocolate
begins to set but is still very flexible, about 2 minutes. Remove
chocolate bands from refrigerator. Using fingertips, lift 1 band from
foil. With chocolate side next to cake, place band around side of
cake; press gently to adhere (band will be higher than cake). Repeat
with second chocolate band, pressing onto uncovered side of cake so
that ends of chocolate bands just meet (if ends overlap, use scissors
to trim any excess paper and chocolate). Refrigerate until chocolate
sets, about 5 minutes. Gently peel off paper. Refrigerate cake.

Chocolate curls: Line baking sheet with foil. Unwrap 1 square of
chocolate. Place chocolate on its paper wrapper in microwave. Cook on
High just until chocolate begins to soften slightly, about 1 minute
(time will vary depending on power of microwave). Turn chocolate
square onto 1 side and hold in hand. Working over foil-lined sheet,
pull vegetable peeler along sides of chocolate, allowing chocolate
curls to fall gently onto foil. Form as many curls as possible.
Repeat process with remaining chocolate squares. Place curls
decoratively atop cake, mounding slightly. (Can be prepared 1 day
ahead. Refrigerate cake.) Sift powdered sugar over chocolate curls
before serving cake.

1 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 1/4 cup buttermilk

Line bottoms with greased wax paper.
2. Sift together flour, 3/4 c cocoa, baking soda, baking powder
and cinnamon. Mix in buttermilk and coffee (dissolve coffee in an
equal amount of hot water first.)
3. Cream 1 1/2 c butter with the sugar until light and fluffy.
Add the eggs one at a time until thick. Beating on low speed, slowly
mix in buttermilk mixture. Beat 'til well blended. Bake about 35
minutes, or until a straw comes out clean.
4. Remove to racks to cool.  After they are cooled, put in
'fridge'. After 1 hour in 'fridge', split each in half (see note at
bottom.) Wrap each layer in wax paper or plastic wrap, and freeze
immediately. II. SOUR CREAM FILLING:
1. Beat 3/4 c heavy cream, gradually adding 3/4 c
10 x  sugar until stiff.
2. Gently fold in 3/4 c sour cream.  Set aside in 'fridge'
(covered.) III. CHOCOLATE SOUR CREAM FROSTING:
1. Melt remaining (1/2 c) butter.  Add 1/2 c 10x sugar and
remaining (1/2 c) cocoa.  Stir with a wire whisk over low heat until
smooth; cool.
2. Beat remaining (1 1/2 c) heavy cream; add remaining (1 1/2 c)

disintegrate under their own weight during assembly. If the cake tops
rose during baking, the layers will not stack well. You will need to
slice the excess off *after* chilling, but *before* splitting into
layers.

chocolate is melted. Stir until smooth. Refrigerate at
least 4-5 hours, stirring occasionally, until very
thick. Add vanilla and beat until stiff.

cup sugar. Beat in whole egg and egg yolk until
smooth. Stir in cooled chocolate. Alternately stir in
dry ingredients and milk, beginning and ending with
dry ingredients and blending thoroughly after each
addition. In small bowl, whisk egg white with dash of
salt until soft peaks form. Whisk in remaining 1/4 cup
sugar, beating until very thick and glossy and mixture
falls from whisk in heavy ribbon. Gently fold egg
white into batter. Pour batter into 8 or 9 inch heart
shaped cake pan which has been lined with butter and
floured waxed paper. Bake on center shelf of oven at
350 degrees about 40 minutes or until wooden pick

7. To make the frosting: In a medium mixing bowl, beat egg whites
until stiff enough to hold a point when the beaters are lifted, about
4    minutes.

Luxe Layer Extravaganza

cakes, chocolate

1/2 cup boiling water
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2/3 cup buttermilk
1 2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter, softened (1 stick)
1 1/3 cup granulated sugar
3  eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
1  raspberry filling:
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup water
1 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoon 10 x (confectioners') sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
4  egg whites
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 cup raspberries
1 teaspoon grenadine
1  garnish (optional): whipped cream,; orange zest,
1  fresh raspberries

CHOCOLATE CAKE:

PREPARE THE CAKE:  Grease a 15 x 10 x 1-inch baking pan. Line with
waxed paper.  Grease the waxed paper. Preheat the oven to moderate
(350F).

Pour the boiling water over the cocoa powder in a medium-size bowl;
stir to dissolve the cocoa.  Stir in the buttermilk; the mixture
should be cool. Sift the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt
onto a sheet of waxed paper.

Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at
medium speed until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time,
beating after each addition. Add the vanilla. Beat the dry
ingredients into the butter mixture, alternating with the cocoa
mixture, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Pour into the
prepared pan.

Bake for 20 minutes or until the center springs back when lightly
pressed. Cool the cake in the pan on a large wire rack for 10
minutes. Turn the cake out onto the rack to cool completely. Remove
the waxed paper.

PREPARE THE FILLING:  Heat the granulated sugar and water to boiling
in a very small saucepan over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the
sugar. Boil until the temperature registers 240 F on a candy
thermometer, about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, beat the heavy cream, 10 X sugar, and vanilla in a small
bowl until stiff.  Cover and refrigerate.

Using clean beaters, beat together the egg whites and cream of tartar
in a large bowl until soft peaks form. Slowly beat the hot syrup into
the egg whites, beating until the meringue forms stiff peaks and is
cool.

Place the raspberries in a blender or food processor. Whirl for about
5 seconds to puree.  Fold the raspberries and grenadine into the
whipped cream. Gently fold the meringue into the raspberry cream. Set
aside.

ASSEMBLE THE CAKE:  Cut the cake crosswise into three equal
rectangles (5 x 10 inches).  Place one rectangle on a serving
platter. Top with 2 cups of the filling. Repeat two more times,
ending with a layer of raspberry cream. Garnish with whipped cream,
orange zest, or fresh raspberries, if you wish.

100 gm praline
60 gm chopped almond

4  whites
120 gm sugar
4  yolks
100 gm flour

      ----CHOCOLATE GLAZE----
200 gm whipped cream
100 gm glucose
200 gm chocolate
50 gm bitter chocolate
30 gm butter

Get the ring of a springform cake or a cake ring and trace the
pattern onto some wax paper.

Melt the milk chocolate over a double boiler, add the praline
(praline is hazlenuts ground with sugar) and the chopped almonds.
Spread on the sheet of waxed paper and freeze.

Whip the whites and sugar together as hard as they will go. Gently
incorperate the yolks, and then incorperate the flour/cocoa mix.
Spread or pipe batter onto sheets in shapes larger than the ring.
Bake at 375-390 till they are done (tell by looking at them and
feeling them).

Chop the bitter chocolate and chocolate for the mousse. Boil the
creme and pour it over the chocolate. Add the butter.

Whip the cream to almost hard peak, and when the chocolate truffle has
cooled, add the whipped cream and incorperate.

Boil the sugar and water, add the alcohol.

Cut rocher chocolate to fit into cake circle.

Put the bottom layer of the cake on a flat surface. Put the circle
over it and press down, so that the edges are cut off and the center
is inside the circle with a good seal. Brush syrup on bottom layer.
Put some mousse in and then put the layer of rocher chocolate in.

Put another layer of mousse in. Brush top layer with syrup, and put
it into the cake. Put cake in fridge for a hour or so. Remove the
ring from the cake.

Boil the cream/glucose and pour it over the chopped chocolate for the
glaze (glucose is sort of like cooked sugar or very heavy corn syrup.
I reduce some corn syrup and sugar till it's very thick but still
liquidy when cooled). Add the butter to the glaze, mix, and pour over
cake. Spread with a spatula to cover the entire cake.

Decorate with piped chocolate truffle, white chocolate, or whatever
you like. Posted on rec.food.recipes by ah787@freenet.carleton.ca

My Mom's Extraordinary Chocolate Chip Cake

cakes, chocolate

2 cup all-purpose flour --
1  unbleached
2 cup light brown sugar -- packed
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1  stick unsalted butter -- cut
1  in 6 pieces
1 large egg
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup sour cream
2 tablespoon milk
9 ounce semisweet chocolate chips
1  optional

1. Position oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 325
degrees F.  Butter a 11x7x1 3/4-inch baking pan or ovenproof glass
baking dish.

2. Put the flour, brown sugar and cinnamon in a large bowl and mix
with an electric mixer on low speed for 15 seconds. Add the butter
and mix till the butter pieces are the size of peas. You will still
see loose flour. Mix in the egg.  The mixture will still look dry.
Rub any lumps out of the baking soda and gently mix the baking soda
into the sour cream. Stir the sour cream mixture and the milk into
the batter.  Stir just until the batter is evenly moistened.  Stir in
the chocolate chips. The batter will be thick.

3.  Spread the batter in the prepared baking pan. Bake about 40
minutes. To test for doneness, gently press your fingers on the top
of the cake. The middle should feel slightly soft and the edges firm.
A toothpick in the center should have a few crumbs clinging to it.
Cool on a wire baking rack, the center of the cake will sink slightly.

Notes:  My metal cake pan is the size specified, like a small lasagna
pan. The cake took 47 minutes to bake.

The 2 Tb. milk is optional, I find the cake is better with it.

This cake is good dusted with powdered sugar and is also good served
with vanilla ice cream.

1 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa
1 3/4 cup granulated sugar, divided
1 3/4 cup egg whites (about 11), at room temp; erature
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
2 teaspoon vanilla

Fruit compote, optional (see accompanying recipes)

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

In a small bowl, combine flour and cocoa with 3/4 cup sugar. Mix well
and set aside.

Place egg whites in a large mixing bowl. Add salt and cream of
tartar. Beat at high speed of an electric mixer until soft peaks
form. Test by turning off machine and raising beater slowly.
Gradually add the remaining sugar, 1/4 cup at a time, beating well
after each addition. Continue beating until stiff peaks form when you
remove the beaters.

With a rubber spatula, gently fold in the vanilla. Then sprinkle a
fourth of the flour mixture over the beaten egg whites. Using an
under-and-over motion, gently fold in the flour with the spatula. Do
5 strokes, rotating the bowl as you fold in the flour. Repeat three
more times, until the flour mixture is all used up. Then fold an
additional 10 strokes. Flour mixture should be blended into the egg
whites.

Gently pour the batter into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan. Bake 35 to
40 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean. Invert tube pan
over the neck of a glass bottle. Keep the cake inverted until
completely cool, at least two hours.

1/2 cup semisweet chocolate pieces
2/3 cup sugar
2 cup very finely chopped almonds or peca; ns
3/4 teaspoon pure vanilla
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1/4 cup sugar

1 cup semisweet chocolate pieces
1 teaspoon butter or margarine
1/2 teaspoon instant coffee crystals
1 tablespoon hot water
3 tablespoon dairy sour cream
1/4 teaspoon maple flavoring

Servings: 10 to 15

DIRECTIONS: Set a large mixer bowl in a sink filled with 2 inches of
warm water. Separate eggs (you should have about 1 1/2 cups whites).
Pour the whites into the warm mixer bowl and place yolks in a smaller
mixer bowl (or let separated eggs stand, covered, at room temperature
for 30 minutes).

Meanwhile, in a small, heavy saucepan, partially melt unsweetened
chocolate and semisweet chocolate pieces over low heat. Turn off heat
and stir (chocolate will continue to melt).

Cut a waxed paper liner for the bottom of a 10" tube pan, cutting it
1/2" wider than the pan and the center hole slightly larger than the
tube. Grease pan thoroughly. Place liner in pan and grease liner.

Beat egg yolks with an electric mixer on high speed for about 4
minutes or till they're thick and lemon colored. Add the 2/3 cup
sugar, beating till very thick. Stir in the melted chocolate and
chopped nuts.

Thoroughly wash and dry beaters. Beat egg whites with vanilla and
almond extract till foamy. Gradually add the 1/4 cup sugar to egg
whites, beating till soft peaks form.

Lighten egg yolk mixture with about 2 cups beaten egg whites. Add to
the remaining egg white mixture and fold together to combine. Turn
batter into prepared pan.

Bake at 350-F for about 40 minutes or till top springs back when
lightly touched. Run a knife around the edge of the pan and center to
loosen. Cool in pan for 1 hour. Invert onto cake plate. Remove waxed
paper.

Prepare glaze; spread over top and sides of cake.

Dark Chocolate Glaze: In a small heavy saucepan or skillet, melt
chocolate over low heat. Remove from heat and stir in butter or
margarine. In a small bowl, dissolve instant coffee in hot water.

4 large egg whites
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
1 1/2 cup sugar
2 3/4 cup heavy cream
6 ounce fine quality bittersweet chocolate; (not unsweetened)
1 1/2 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
3 tablespoon cold water
1 1/2 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla
3 pint fresh raspberries

1. Preheat oven to 250F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and
trace 3 8-inch circles onto the paper.

2. In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat whites with cream of
tartar and add a pinch of salt until they just hold soft peaks. Add 1
cup sugar gradually, beating, and beat meringue until it holds stiff
peaks. Transfer meringue to a pastry bag fitted with a 3/4 inch plain
tip and pipe onto circles, filling them in. Smooth meringues with a
long metal spatula or knife. Alternatively, if pastry bag isn't used,
circles may be made by spreading meringues freehanded with spatula.

3. Bake meringues 30 minutes and switch positions of baking sheets in
oven. Bake meringues 30 minutes more, or until pale golden and crisp.
(If the weather is humid, cooking time may be longer.) Cool meringues
completely and peel off paper. Meringues may be made 1 day ahead and
kept in turned-off oven.

4. In a saucepan, bring 1/4 cup heavy cream just to a boil and remove
from heat. Add chocolate and stir mixture until chocolate is melted
completely. Divide ganache between 2 meringue layers and gently
spread evenly, leaving 1/2 inch borders. Chill ganache until
hardened, about 10 minutes.

5. In a small saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over water and soften 1 min.
Heat mixture over low heat, stirring until gelatin is dissolved, and
keep warm. In a bowl with an electric mixer, beat remaining 2 1/2
cups heavy cream with remaining 1/2 cup sugar until it just holds
stiff peaks and then beat in sour cream and vanilla. Add gelatin
mixture in a stream, beating, and beat until mixture holds stiff
peaks.

6. Arrange 1 ganache-topped meringue on a plate and spread it with 1
1/2 cups cream mixture, mounding it at the edge. Arrange 1 pint of
raspberries over the cream mixture and top with the second ganache-
topped meringue. Repeat procedure with about 1 1/2 cups more cream
mixture and another pint of raspberries and top with the third
meringue.

7. Transfer about 1 cup more cream mixture to a pastry bag fitted
with the star tip and reserve for decoration. Frost top and side of
cake with remaining cream mixture and decorate with reserved mixture.
Chill cake for at least 2 hours and up to 8 hours. Remove wax paper
carefully and scatter remaining  pint of raspberries around and on
the cake. Cut into 12 wedges with a serrated or electric knife.

Red Velvet Cake With History

cakes, chocolate

2 1/4 cup cake flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup baking cocoa
1 1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 cup oil
2  eggs
2 teaspoon to 1 ounce of red food color
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1 cup buttermilk
1  frosting:
1 pkg 8 ounce cream cheese
1  stick butter
1 pound box powdered sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
1  milk as needed

Red velvet cake also known as the $100 dollar cake, $200 dollar cake,
or Waldorph Astoria Cake is only a legend as is the Nieman Marcus
cookies and all are examples of a legend that pits institutions
against a consumer who feels he/she has been unfairly charged.The
recipe is a grass roots recipe not an institutional one.

James Beard outlines in his American Cookery that there is really 3
varieties of red velvet cake, recipes being different in the use of
butter, vegetable shortening ( crisco ) and oil.Most all call for
cake flour and buttermilk, baking soda and vinegar for the leaving
process.

The redness of the cake comes from red food color despite the chemical
reaction of baking soda, vinegar , buttermilk and cocoa which cause a
reddish brown color, not red in the cake.

This cake is moist and red with a velvety texture and the flavor
nondistinctive as is most red velvet cakes. Red Velvet cake is also
cultural as recipes differ in community cookbooks accross America
even as to the type of frosting for the cake. The moistest cake is
one made with oil and cake flour.The amount of food color is up to
you.Start with 2 teaspoons as a base.

The above recipe comes from:" Celebrating Our Mothers' Kitchen", a
fundraising cookbook published by The National Council for Negro
Woman.

Preparation: Grease and flour 2, 9 inch pans and line with paper.In a
large bowl combine flour, baking soda, cocoa and salt. In another
bowl with mixer at low speed or spoon beat sugar and oil until
blended. Add eggs, one at a time to blend well.Blend in food color,
vanilla and vinegar.Scape bowl down with spatula. Alternately blend
in flour mixture and buttermilk, using about 1/3 each time and
scraping bowl down at least twice. Do not beat on high or cake will
be tough.Pour into prepared pans and bake in a preheated 350 degree
oven 20 to 25 minutes or tested done with toothpick.Cool on racks 5
minutes and remove from pan and cool completely.Frost layers when
cold.Beat cream cheese until softened and smooth. Add butter and
continue to beat till softened. Beat in sugar a little at a time and
then vanilla.If too thick blend in cold milk a tablespoon at a time
till desired consisitency.

[*Note: I'm wildly guessing on the conversion for the poundcake
crumbs. One slice (1/17 th of a whole 8 1/2 x 3 1/2 x 3 1/4

Combine the whole eggs with the sugar, hold the bowl over some
steaming water, and beat until cooled off. Add flour, cake crumbs,
cinnamon and lemon peel.  Then add the melted butter with the cocoa.

chocolate glaze and stud with almond slivers.

*DIRECTIONS*

*For the nicest looking shiny glaze, serve this cake on the day it is
completed.  The cake remains moist and delicious, however, for several
days.

PREPARATION: Heat oven to 325F. Butter and flour an 8-inch square or
10-inch round cake pan. Cut the 4 ounces of chocolate into small
pieces and melt in the top of a double boiler set over hot water,
stirring frequently. Remove pan from hot water and cool slightly. In
a food processor, nut grinder or blender, grind the 4 ounces of
almonds to a powder. If you use a processor or blender, put 2
tablespoons of the sugar in the machine along with the nuts.  Put
ground nuts through a sieve to get rid of any remaining chunks. Toss
the powdered almond mixture with the flour. Separate the eggs. Beat
together the butter and 1/3 cup of the remaining sugar until creamy
and light. Add the melted chocolate and the extract. Add the egg
yolks, one at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition. Beat
the whites to stiff peaks, add the remaining sugar, and beat until
glossy. Fold in nut mixture. Gently followed egg white mixture into
chocolate just until incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared
pan. Bake in a preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the
center of the cake comes out almost clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in
the pan for about 10 minutes. Divide into individual servings if
desired. Recipe can be made to this point up to a day ahead.

CHOCOLATE GLAZE: Heat the chocolate and butter in the top of a double
boiler set over hot water, stirring frequently, until just melted.
Remove from hot water. Cool the chocolate glaze just until it
thickens. It should remain pourable. Glaze whole cake or individual
servings on a rack set over a pan to catch drippings. Garnish with
almonds if desired.

Serve at room temperature or refrigerate for up to 4 days.

3/4 cup sour cream

1 cup ; water
4 ounce baking chocolate
      ----FROSTING----
1/3 cup butter or regular margarine
3 cup confectioners' sugar
1/2 cup sour cream
3 ounce baking chocolate

Sift togetehr the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt
into a large mixing bowl.  Add shortening, sour cream, vanilla, eggs,
water and chocolate (melted then cooled).  Beat with an electric
mixer at low speed, scraping bowl constantly, for 1/2 minute.
Increase speed to high and beat an additional 3 minutes, scraping
bowl occasionally. Pour batter into 2 greased and waxed-paper lined
9-inch round cake pans. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F. Oven for 35
minutes or until cake tests done. Cool in pans on racks for 10
minutes.  Remove from pans and cool completely on the racks. Place
one cake layer on serving plate. Spread with Sour Cream / Chocolate
Frosting.  Top with second cake layer.  Frost sides and top of the
cake with the remaining Sour Cream/Chocolate Frosting. SOUR
CREAM/CHOCOLATE FROSTING: Combine the softened butter or margarine,
confectioners' sugar, and sour cream in a mixing bowl; blend well.
Add chocolate which has been melted and cooled and vanilla. Beat
until smooth. NOTE: I have seen reference to people having trouble
with their layer cakes and how they rise.  Try this little trick when
making this cake. Take the layer that has the least amount of rise on
the top and trim it to be flat with a sharp knife.  Place the trimmed
side down (layer should be upside down). Then frost between layers
and place the other layer on right side up and finished frosting.  It
will give the illusion of having a cake with only one domed layer and
will sit better on your cake plate. Also the trimmings are great
eating just plain for the cook or for the kids.

Sour Cream Coffee Cake W/ Chocolate & Walnuts

cakes, entertain

1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter; softened
3/4 cup sugar
2 cup sifted all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoon baking powder
3  large eggs
1 cup sour cream
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts
4 ounce bittersweet chocolate; coarsely chopped

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour a 10-to 12-cup fluted
tube pan. In a large bowl, using a hand-held electric mixer set at
high speed, beat the butter until creamy, about 1 minute. Add the
sugar and continue beating at high speed until light and creamy,
about 2 minutes. Sift together the flour, salt, baking soda, and
baking powder. At low speed, beat in 1/2 cup of the flour mixture,
then beat in 1 of the eggs. Beat in another 1/2 cup of the flour
mixture, then 1 of the remaining eggs. Repeat with another 1/2 cup of
the flour mixture, and the last egg. Beat in the remaining flour
along with the sour cream and vanilla. Using a spatula, fold in the
walnuts and chocolate. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and
smooth the surface. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes in the preheated oven
until the cake begins to shrink from the sides of the pan and a
toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The surface will
crack. Remove the cake from the oven and let cool for about 10
minutes in the pan, then turn it out onto a wire cake rack. Cool
completely before serving. Serves 12. Source: An Edible Christmas"

Sourdough Chocolate Cake

cakes, chocolate

1/2 cup sourdough starter
1 1/2 cup all purpose flour
2 cup sugar
3/4 cup powdered cocoa (not instant)
2 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3/4 cup cold coffee
1 teaspoon vanilla

Few people bake cakes from scratch anymore unless they can produce
something that's not possible with a mix. This sourdough chocolate
cake falls in that category. It's got a fudge-like quality you can't
get any way except with sourdough and since it's all mixed in one
bowl, it's almost as easy as a boxed cake.

Put the starter in a large bowl, cover loosely and allow to stand at
room temperature until active and bubbling -- at least one hour. Then
add the rest of the ingredients, in the order given, beating well
after each addition.  It is not necessary to sift or premix any of
the ingredients as long as you are careful to get the baking powder
and soda evenly mixed.

Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, pour in the batter,
which will be thin, and bake in a preheated 350ø. oven for about 30
minutes, or until the layers test done when poked with a toothpick.
The cake will have pulled away from the sides of the pan.

Allow to cool about 10 minutes before removing from pans, then finish
cooling the layers on wire racks. Do not frost until the cake is
completely cold.

A mild chocolate butter cream frosting is nice with this cake.

Swedish Chocolate Cake

cakes

1 cup shortening
1 1/2 cup sugar
3  eggs
2 ounce baking chocolate (unsweetened), mel; ted
2 cup cake flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup cream, heavy
2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.  Butter a Bundt pan and sprinkle with
about 2 tablespoon dry bread crumbs, until it is well-coated. This makes a
much better crust than flour does.

In a large bowl, add the sugar to the shortening and cream well.
Blend in the eggs, one at a time, and beat well. Stir in the melted
chocolate.

Sift together the dry ingredients.  Combine the cream and vanilla
extract. Add to the chocolate mixture alternately with the dry
ingredients, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Pour the
batter into the pan and bake for 50-60 minutes. Cool the cake in the
pan a few minutes before removing.

NOTES:

*  A rich chocolate Bundt cake -- I got this recipe from my mom, who
got it from an American book called Swedish Baking. I like to make
this because it does not need to be frosted, which makes it an easy
dessert. Yield: one Bundt cake.

*  This is not an authentic Swedish recipe because their flour is
different enough to cause problems in baking. However, the results
seem authentic.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, 1 hour baking.
: Precision:  measure carefully.

The Ultimate Chocolate Mousse Cake

cakes, chocolate

1 pound bittersweet chocolate; coar sely chopped
1/2 pound butter; unsalted
6  eggs; lightly beaten
1  chocolate ganache glaze
2/3 cup heavy cream
6 ounce semi-sweet chocolate; finel y chopped

Fat grams    per serving:              Approx. Cook Time:
:15 CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE: 1. Preheat the oven to 425F. Wrap the
outside of an 8-inch springform  pan in a double layer of aluminum
foil to prevent seepage.
Butter the pan and line the bottom with a round of parchment or waxed
paper.  Butter the paper. 2. Combine the chocolate and butter in a
large metal bowl over a pan of hot - not simmering - water (the
bottom of the bowl should not touch the water). Let stand, stirring
occasionally, until the chocolate is smooth and melted. Or melt in a
glass bowl in a microwave oven on high (100%), stopping and stirring
every 15 seconds; remove the chocolate when there are still a few
lumps and stir until completely smooth. 3. Put the eggs in a large
mixer bowl set over simmering water and stir constantly until warm to
the touch, about 3 minutes; remove from the heat.  With an electric
mixer, beat the eggs until they triple in volume and form soft peaks
when the beater is lifted, 5 to 8 minutes. (To ensure maximum volume,
if using a hand-held mixer, continue to beat the eggs over simmering
water until they are hot to the touch, about 5 minutes, then remove
from the heat and beat until cool.) 4. Fold half the eggs into the
melted chocolate until partially incorporated. Add the remaining eggs
and fold until they are just blended and no streaks remain. 5. Pour
at once into the prepared springform pan and smooth the surface with
a spatula. Place in a larger roasting pan and add enough hot water to
the pan to reach about two-thirds of the way up the springform. 6.
Bake for 5 minutes. Cover the top of the springform loosely with
lightly buttered aluminum foil and bake for 10 minutes longer. Remove
the cake from the oven and let cool on a rack for 45 minutes; then
cover and refrigerate until chilled and very firm, about 3 hours. 7.
To unmold, run a small spatula or a blunt knife around the edge and
remove the side of the springform. Carefully invert the cake into a
plate that has been covered with plastic wrap and remove the bottom
of the springform; peel off the parchment. Reinvert the cake onto a
cardboard round or a cake plate. Cover and refrigerate for 6 hours or
overnight, until thoroughly chilled, before serving. 8. If you want
to cover the cake with a chocolate ganache glaze, set it on a rack or
tuck strips of waxed paper around the bottom of the cake. Pour the
tepid glaze onto the center of the cake, letting it cascade over the
sides. Run a long metal spatula lightly across the top so that the
glaze will not be too thick.  If necessary, use the spatula to patch
any pare spots. Work quickly before the glaze sets. Prick any air
bubbles with a needle or pin. Carefully remove any strips of waxed
paper. Let the glaze stand undisturbed until set, 2 to 3 hours at
room temperature, or 30 minutes in the refrigerator. CHOCOLATE
GANACHE GLAZE: 1. In a small heavy saucepan, scald the cream.  Remove
from the heat and immediately add the chopped chocolate. Cover and
let stand for 5 minutes; then stir gently until the chocolate is
fully melted and smooth. Let cool until tepid. 2. Stir the glaze to
test it.  It is ready to use when a small amount mounds just a tiny
bit when dropped from the spoon before disappearing into the mixture.
If the glaze is too thick and the mound remainds on the surface, add
warm water (or liqueur) by the teaspoonful, testing until the
consistency is correct. If for some reason the glaze remains too
thin, stir in more finely grated chocolate, heat until melted and
then let cool again. Variations

MINI-MOUSSE CAKE: This cake is perfect for serving 6 to 8. Make the
Ultimate chocolate Mousse Cake, using 1/2 pound chocolate, 4 ounces of
butter and 3 lightly beaten eggs. Bake in a 6-inch springform pan;
temperature and baking remain the same. MOCHA FUDGE MOUSSE CAKE: Make
the Ultimate Chocolate Mousse cake, prefereably using
extra-bittersweet chocolate.  In step 2, add 2 tablespoons instant
expresso powder to the melted chocolate and butter.  In step 5, pour
halfe the chocolate mousse batter into the prepared springform pan
and drizzle with have the Hot fudge (see recipe).  Add the remaining
batter and drizzle on the remaining fudge. PRALINE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE
CAKE: Make the Ultimate Chocolate Mousse Cake, preferably using
extra-bittersweet chocolate. In Step 2, add 1/2 cup praline paste
(see note) to the melted chocolate and butter. Garnish, if desired
with toasted hazelnuts. (Toasted pecans are also nice). NOTE: Praline
paste can be ordered from Maison Glass, 52 E. 58th St., New York, NY
10022; 212 755-3316. CHOCOLATE FRUIT MOUSSE CAKE: Make the Ultimate
Chocolate Mousse Cake, preferably using extra-bittersweet chocolate.
In Step 2, add 3/4 cup raspberry jelly or melted and strained apricot
jam to the melted chocolate and butter.
Garnish the cake with a sparkling glaze of 1/2 cup melted raspberry
jelly or strained appricot jam mixed with 1 Tablespoon framboise
(raspberry eau-de-vie). Spoon this glaze over the top of the cake and
immediately spread into a thin, even layer with a long, narrow
spatula. BRANDIED CHERRY CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE: Make the Brandied
Cherrys (see recipe) at least a day ahead.  Make the Ultimate
Chocolate Mousse Cake (using semi-sweet chocolate). After Step 4,
fold in 1 cup halved, well-drained brandied cherrys.

Triple Chocolate Mousse Cake

      ----DARK CHOCOLATE MOUSSE----
2 tablespoon strongly brewed coffee, cool
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoon unflavored powdered gelatin
3 large egg yolks
1 1/4 cup heavy cream, divided
3/4 cup milk
1/4 cup granulated sugar
6 ounce bittersweet chocolate, finely chopp; ed
      ----MILK CHOCOLATE MOUSSE----
2 tablespoon strongly brewed coffee, cool
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoon unflavored powdered gelatin
3 large egg yolks
1 1/4 cup heavy cream, divided
3/4 cup milk
2 tablespoon granulated sugar
6 ounce milk chocolate, chop fine
      ----WHITE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE----
2 tablespoon coconut rum, such as malibu
1 tablespoon water
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 teaspoon unflavored powdered gelatin
8 ounce white chocolate, coarsely chopped
3/4 cup milk
1 cup heavy cream

Make the dark chocolate mousse layer: Place the coffee and vanilla in
a small cup. Sprinkle the gelatin over the mixture and let the
gelatin soften for 5 minutes. In a medium bowl, whisk the yolks until
blended. In a heavy, medium saucepan, combine 3/4 cup of the cream,
the milk and sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally,
until small bubbles form around the side of the pan. Remove the pan
from the heat. Gradually whisk about 3/4 cup of the hot cream mixture
into the yolks until blended. Pour this mixture back into the
saucepan. Continue cooking over medium-low heat, stirring constantly
with a wooden spoon for 2 to 4 minutes, until the custard has
thickened slightly. It is done when you can run your finger down the
back of the coated spoon and a path remains in the custard for
several seconds. Do not allow the custard to boil. Remove the pan
from the heat and immediately strain the custard into a stainless
steel bowl. Add the softened gelatin mixture to the custard and stir
until completely dissolved. Add the chocolate and stir until melted
and smooth. Set the bowl over a larger bowl containing ice water and
stir for 5 to 10 minutes, until cool. Remove the bowl from the bowl
of ice water. In a chilled medium bowl, using a handheld electric
mixer, beat the remaining 1/2 cup of the cream until soft peaks start
to form. Using a rubber spatula, fold one third of the whipped cream
into the chocolate mixture. Fold in the remaining whipped cream.
Scrape the mousse into a 9-by-3-inch springform pan and, using a
small offset metal cake spatula, smooth it into an even layer. Place
the pan in the freezer for 1 hour, until the mousse is firmly set.

Make the milk chocolate mousse layer: Follow the procedure in the
steps above, substituting the ingredients listed for the milk
chocolate mousse layer for those in the dark chocolate mousse layer,
and pouring the milk chocolate mousse over the dark chocolate mousse
layer in the pan. Place the pan in the freezer for 1 hour, until the
mousse is firmly set.

Make the white chocolate mousse layer: Place the rum, water and
vanilla in a small, heatproof cup. Sprinkle the gelatin over the
mixture and allow it to soften for 5 minutes. Place the cup with the
softened gelatin in a small pan with enough water to come halfway up
the sides of the cup. Heat the gelatin mixture in hot, not simmering,
water. Stir the gelatin frequently for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the
gelatin granules dissolve completely and the mixture is clear. Remove
the pan from the heat, leaving the cup in the water to keep the
gelatin mixture warm until ready to use. Place the chocolate in a
large bowl. In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring the milk to a
gentle boil. Pour the hot milk over the chocolate and let the mixture
stand for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Add the warm gelatin
mixture and whisk until smooth. Place the bowl over a larger bowl of
ice water and stir for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the mixture is cool.
In a chilled, medium bowl, using a handheld electric mixer, beat the
cream at medium speed just until it begins to form soft mounds. Do
not overbeat or the mousse will be grainy. Fold one-third of the
whipped cream into the white chocolate mixture. Fold in the remaining
whipped cream. Scrape the white chocolate mousse onto the milk
chocolate mousse layer, smoothing the top with a cake spatula. Place
the cake in the freezer for 2 hours, until the top layer is firmly
set.

Unmold the cake: Using a portable hair dryer or a damp, hot towel,
carefully heat the outside of the springform pan slightly. Release the
clamp on the side of the springform pan and gently remove it. Using a
large metal spatula, gently transfer the cake from the bottom of the
springform pan to a serving platter. Place the cake in the
refrigerator for at least 1 hour before serving.

1 1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon instant coffee granules
3/4 cup boiling water
12 ounce unsalted butter -- softened
6 large eggs -- at room temperature
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1  raspberry coulis:
12 ounce bag frozen unsweetened --
1  raspberries
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 tablespoon black raspberry liqueur --
1  such as chambord
1  decoration:
1 1/2 cup heavy cream
1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons granulated
1  sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1  fresh raspberries for --
1  garnish (optional)

Make the cake: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat
to 350 degrees F. Butter the bottom and sides of a 9-by-2 1/2-inch
round springform pan. Line the bottom of the pan with a round of
parchment or waxed paper and butter the paper.

In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, process the
chocolates, sugar and coffee for 15 to 20 seconds until finely
ground. With the motor of the food processor running, pour the
boiling water through the feed tube. Process for 10 to 15 seconds,
until the chocolate is completely melted. Using a spatula, scrape
down the sides of the work bowl. Add the butter and process for about
5 seconds, or until incorporated. Add the eggs and vanilla and
process for about 5 seconds, just until the mixture is smooth and
creamy. Scrape the chocolate batter into the prepared pan and smooth
the top with a rubber spatula.

Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, until the edges of the cake are puffy and
the center is just set. Cool the cake in the pan set on a wire rack
for 30 minutes. Cover and refrigerate forat least 3 hours, or until
ready to serve.

Make the raspberry coulis: In a medium saucepan, combine the frozen
raspberries and sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly
with a wooden spoon, until the sugar is completely dissolved and the
berries are soft. Do not let the mixture boil. Strain the
raspberrymixture through a fine-meshed sieve into a bowl. Stir in the
raspberry liqueur. Cover and refrigerate.

Decorate the chocolate cake: Run a thin-bladed knife around the edge
of the cake to loosen it from the sides of the springform pan. Remove
the side of the springform pan. Invert the cake onto a serving plate.
Peel off the paper. Refrigerate the cake while you prepare the
whipped cream.

In a chilled large bowl, using a handheld electric mixer set at medium
speed, beat the cream with the sugar and vanilla just until stiff
peaks begin to form.

Using an offset metal cake spatula, spread a thin even layer of
whipped cream over the top of the chocolate cake. Fill a pastry bag
fitted with a star tip (such as Ateco #6) withthe remaining whipped
cream. Completely cover the top of the cake with whipped cream
rosettes.

To serve, drizzle some of the raspberry coulis onto each dessert
plate. With a sharp thin-bladed knife, slice the cake, wiping the
blade clean between each slice. Place the slices on the dessert
plates, and garnish with fresh raspberries if desired.

White Chocolate & Macadamia Nut Brownies

cakes, deserts, microwave, snacks

2/3 cup macadamia nuts
1 cup flour; plus 2 tbsp.
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1/2 cup sugar
2 tablespoon water
9 ounce white chocolate
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. If macadamia nuts are salted, blanch in
boiling water to cover for 30 seconds to remove salt. Rinse under cold
running water and transfer to a baking sheet. Toast in a 325 degrees
F oven until golden brown. Let cool, then coarsely chop. If nuts are
unsalted, just toast and chop.

2. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

3. Place butter, sugar, and water in a medium saucepan over low heat.
Cut 6 ounces of the white chocolate into large (1- or 2-inch) chunks
and the remaining 3 ounces into small (1/4-inch to 1/2-inch) chips.

4. When butter has melted, remove from heat, add the 6 ounces white
chocolate chunks and stir until chocolate melts.

5. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Stir in flour mixture until just
blended. Stir in the 3 ounces of white chocolate chips and the nuts.

6. Spread batter in a greased 8- or 9-inch square baking pan. Bake 30
to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out
clean. Cool on a wire rack, then cut into squares.

* Timesaver Tip: Brownie batter can be made ahead and frozen before
baking. Line an 8- or 9-inch square pan with heavy-duty foil. Spoon
batter into pan. Freeze batter, uncovered, until frozen solid. Remove
from pan and wrap tightly. Label and date package. Freeze at 0
degrees F up to 4 weeks. To bake, peel foil from batter and place in
greased pan. Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F oven until skewer
inserted in center comes out clean (40 to 50 minutes).

Microwave Version: Chocolate may be melted in a microwave oven. Place
butter and chocolate in a small glass bowl. Microwave on 50% power
for 1 minute, stir, then continue microwaving 1 to 3 minutes more.
Stir until smooth. Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch around
edges and won't blend smoothly. Stir in sugar and water and continue
with step 5.

2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup unsalted pistachio nuts
1 1/4 cup all purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
6 tablespoon unsalted butter; room temp
1 cup sugar
3 large egg yolks
5 large egg whites
3 pint baskets strawberries
      ----FROSTING----
1 1/4 cup half and half
3/4 cup unsalted pistachio nuts
1/2 cup sugar
4 large egg yolks
2 tablespoon all purpose flour
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup unsalted butter; room temp
7 ounce package marzipan
2 tablespoon powdered sugar; plus 1/4 cup
1 1/2 cup whipping cream; chilled

This pull-out-all-stops dessert layers a white chocolate pistachio
cake with strawberries and a do-ahead pistachio butter-cream. For the
finishing touches, whipped cream is piped up the sides, and a
marzipan top is crowned with fresh strawberries.

To make cake: Preheat oven to 350F. Butter and flour two
9-inch-diameter cake pans with 1 1/2-inch-high-sides. Bring half and
half to simmer in small saucepan. Remove from heat. Add chocolate and
vanilla and stir until smooth; cool to room temperature. Finely grind
pistachios with flour and baking powder in processor. Using electric
mixer, beat butter and 3/4 cup sugar in large bowl until fluffy. Add
yolks 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in flour
mixture alternately with white chocolate mixture in 2 additions each.
Using clean dry beaters, beat egg whites in medium bowl until soft
peaks form. Gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar, beating until
stiff but not dry. Fold whites into batter in 2 additions. Divide
batter between prepared pans. Bake cakes until tester inserted into
center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool 10 minutes. Cut around
pan sides to loosen cakes. Turn out cakes onto racks; cool
completely. Hull and slice 2 baskets strawberries. Place 1 cake layer
on platter. Spread 1 cup buttercream over. Arrange enough berry
slices over to cover. Spread 1 cup buttercream over. Arrange another
layer of sliced berries over to cover. Spread thin layer of
buttercream over second cake layer and place cake, buttercream side
down, atop berries. Press gently to adhere. Spread remaining
buttercream over top and sides of cake. Chill cake until buttercream
is firm, about 1 hour. Knead marzipan in medium bowl to soften. Shape
marzipan into disk. Dust work surface with 2 tablespoons powdered
sugar. Roll out marzipan disk on powdered sugar to 9 1/2-round. Place
on cake; press to adhere to top and gently press overhang onto sides
of cake. Beat whipping cream and remaining 1/4 cup powdered sugar in
large bowl to firm peaks. Transfer to large pastry bag fitted with
medium star tip. Pipe cream in side-by-side columns up sides of cake.
Pipe border of rosettes around top edge of cake. Refrigerate cake
until cold, at least 2 hours. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover
with cake dome and keep refrigerated. Let stand at room temperature
30 minutes before continuing.) Arrange remaining whole strawberries
in center of cake.

To make frosting: Bring half and half and pistachios to boil in heavy
small saucepan. Remove from heat; cover and let stand 1 hour. Whisk
sugar, yolks and flour in medium bowl to blend. Bring half and half
mixture to simmer; gradually whisk into yolk mixture. Return to same
saucepan; stir over medium heat until mixture bubbles thickly, about
5 minutes. Mix in vanilla. Transfer to processor; blend until nuts
are very finely chopped. Transfer pistachio pastry cream to bowl.
Cover and cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. Using electric
mixer, beat unsalted butter in large bowl until fluffy. Add pastry
cream by 1/4 cupfuls, beating well after each addition. (Can be
prepared 2 days ahead. Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room
temperature before using.)

Whoopee Pies

appetizers, cakes, chocolate

1 cup sugar
1/2 cup solid white vegetable shortening
2 cup unbleached flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1  filling:
1/2 cup butter, softened (1 stick)
7 1/2 ounce marshmallow creme (1 jar)
3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
1/4 cup solid white vegetable shortening
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Yield:  About 20 "Pies"

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  Grease 3 or 4 baking sheets and
set aside.

TO MAKE THE PIES:

Beat the sugar and shortening in the large bowl of an electric mixer
until well blended.  Mix the flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt in a
medium-sized bowl with a wire whisk until light and thoroughly
combined. (Using the wire whisk to blend the dry ingredients, in this
case, makes sifting unnecessary.)  With the electric mixer running on
low speed, add the flour mixture and milk alternately to the sugar
mixture, starting and ending with the flour mixture, beating well
after each addition. beat in the vanilla.

Drop the batter by heaping measuring TBLS. 2 inches apart on the
prepared baking sheets.  (The little cakes will be about 2 1/2 inches
in diameter after baking) You should have about 40 cakes. Bake for 15
minutes or until cakes spring back when touched lightly. Remove to
wire racks to cool.

TO MAKE THE FILLING:

In a large bowl, combine the butter, marshmallow creme, sugar,
shortening and vanilla.  Beat for 2 minutes, using an electric mixer
set on high speed, until light and fluffy.

ASSEMBLY:

Place about 1 TBS of filling on the flat sides of half the cakes. Top
with the remaining cakes and press together so that the filling
squashes out the sides a little.

NOTE:

Because of all the butter in the filling, these pies should not be
held at room temperature indefinitely. Pies that are not to be eaten
soon after baking should be wrapped in plastic film and refrigerated
or frozen for future use.

1  juice and grated peel of one lemon
1 dash salt
2 tablespoon rum
3 1/2 ounce flaked coconut (100 g)
3 1/2 ounce candied fruit (100 g) [candied cher; ries, per the

3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoon flour (100 g)
1 teaspoon baking powder
4  egg whites, chilled
1  shortening for greasing cake mold
7 ounce dark cake glaze (200 g) [this is a; prepackaged

chocolate glaze available in Germany.  The glaze from the 'Rehruecken'

hard (not creamy) chocolate frosting. K.B.] flaked coconut for garnish

Wash and dry zucchini, and trim off ends.  Finely grate the unpeeled
vegetables.  Spread on a clean dish towel and pat dry. Beat sugar and
yolks until creamy and sugar is dissolved. Add lemon juice, lemon
peel, salt, rum, flaked coconut, and mix well. Cut the candied

mixture. Mix flour and baking powder and add it as well as the grated
zucchini. Beat the chilled egg whites to stiff peaks and carefully
fold into the batter. Pour into well greased 'Rehruecken' mold [I

to 390 degrees F for 40 to 50 minutes.

Let cake cool in pan for 5 to 10 minutes, then carefully invert into a
grate and let cool all the way. Half a day before serving, cover with
cake glaze all around. Let glaze dry. Shortly before serving, dust
with flaked coconut.

3/4 cup margarine
3/4 cup cocoa
2 cup flour
1 1/2 cup sugar
4  eggs
2 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter cream frosting

Melt the margarine and mix with the cocoa.

In a small bowl, mix flour and salt.

In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs.  Then add sugar, vanilla, and beat
well. Add flour and margarine mixture to this and blend thoroughly.

Heat skillet to medium-low.  Drop small clumps (about 1 tablespoon) and
cook
like pancakes:  about 1 1/2 minutes on one side, 1/2 minute on the
other, then turn over again and remove after a few seconds. Freeze.
When relatively hard, coat one side with buttercream frosting.

NOTES:

*  Brownies in a skillet -- This recipe is based on a "chocolate
turtle" recipe by Mae Rabenius from a cookbook produced by Faith
United Methodist Church in Phoenix, Arizona. Yield: 40 pieces.

*  One side of the pancakes may burn.  It doesn't particularly affect
the taste, and if you frost this side, no one will even know.

*  It's not necessary to cook the pancakes completely; if the middle
looks somewhat gooey, don't fret:  it will soon harden.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  10 minutes preparation, 30 minutes to cook, 10 minutes to
frost. : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

Chocolate Pistachio Orange Cake

deserts

1  pistachio sponge
1 cup blanched pistachios
3/4 cup cake flour
4  eggs separated
3/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon grated lemon zest
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
1  orange ganache
12 ounce chocolate, finely cut
1 cup heavy whipped cream
3 tablespoon orange liqueur
1  candied orange filling
1/2 cup candied orange peel
2 tablespoon orange liqueur
1  whipped cream
1 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
2 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon orange liqueur
1  shaved milk chocolate
1  candied orange peel
1  blanched pistachios
1  sugar, confectioners
1  moistening syrup
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup sugar
3 tablespoon orange liqueur

This striking and unusual dessert utilizes three flavors which
harmonize beautifully in taste and appearance.

Preparing the Sponge.  Butter a 9-inch diameter x 2 1/2 - to - inch
deep springform pan and line the bottom with a piece of parchment
paper, cut to fit. Process the nuts in a food processor until very
fine. Sift the cake flour over the nuts and combine.  Whip the yolks,
then whip in half the sugar until light in color and aerated. Whip
the egg whites and salt on medium speed until white and opqaque.
Increase the speed and whip in the remaining sugar.  Continue
whipping the whites until the whites hold a firm peak. Fold the yolks
into the whites, then fold in the pistachio mixture in two or three
additions.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake at 350
degrees F about 30 minutes. Remove from the pan and cool on a rack,
on the paper.

Preparing the Ganache.  Place the chocolate in a bowl. Bring the
cream to a boil and pour over the chocolate. Let stand 2 minutes,
then whisk smooth and strain into another bowl. Refrigerate, whisking
until cool, but not set.

Preparing the Syrup.  Combine the water and sugar in a small pan and
bring to a boil.  Cool and stir in the orange liqueur.

Preparing the Filling.  Finely chop the peel and combine with the
liqueur.

Preparing the Whipped Cream.  Combine the cream, sugar and liqueur
and whip on medium speed until firm.

Assembling.  Using a sharp serrated knife, divide the Pistachio
Sponge into two layers and place one on a cardboard. Moisten with
half the syrup and spread with most of the Ganache, reserving some
for a decoration. Drain the candied peel and distribute evenly on the
Ganache. Cover with a layer of whipped cream. Place the second layer
on the cream and moisten with the remaining syrup.  Cover the outside
of the cake with the shipped cream and press the shavings against the
side of the cake. Make a border of rosettes around the edge of the
cake with the remaining Ganache and decorate the rosettes with
cutouts of candied peel and some pistachios. Place some chipped
pistachios in the center and dust them lightly with confectioners'
sugar.

Holding.  Refrigerate the cake for up to 6 hours before serving.

1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
6  eggs
1  pudding:
1/2 cup sugar
2 tablespoon cornstarch
2 1/2 cup heavy cream
5  egg yolks
8  ounce semisweet chocolate
1 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
2 teaspoon vanilla

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Grease a 9 inch springform pan. Melt
together butter and unsweetened chocolate in top of double boiler
over simmering, not boiling water, stirring until smooth. Set aside.
Mix together flour, baking powder and salt in small bowl. Separate 3
eggs, placing yolks in large bowl; reserve whites. Add 3 whole eggs
and 3/4 cup sugar to yolks; beat at high speed until pale and
lemon-colored, 2-3 minutes. Beat in chocolate mixture at low speed;
beat in flour mixture just until blended. Using clean beaters and a
clean medium-size bowl, beat egg whites until frothy. Add cream of
tartar and beat until soft peaks form. Beat in the remaining 1/4 cup
sugar until stiff, but not dry, peaks form. Stir about one-third of
whites into chocolate mixture until blended. Fold in the remaining
whites. Scrape into the prepared pan, smoothing top. Bake in
preheated oven 40 to 50 minutes or until cake is set in center.
Transfer pan to a rack to cool completetly. Refrigerate until firm.
Meanwhile, prepare pudding; Whisk together sugar and cornstarch in
medium-size heavy saucepan. Whisk in the cream. Bring to simmering
over medium-low heat, stirring constantly. Gradually whisk some of
the cream mixture into egg yolks. Scrape yolk mixture back into
saucepan. Cook over very low heat, whisking constantly, until pudding
is very thick, about 5 minutes; do not let boil. Remove saucepan from
heat. Stir in the chocolate and vanilla until melted and smooth.
Scrape the pudding into a bowl; place plastic wrap directly on the
surface. Refrigerate until cold and thickened for at least 2 hours.
To assemble: Remove sides of pan from cake. Using a serrated knife,
cut cake horizontally into 3 equal layers. Place 1 layer on serving
plate; spread top with 3/4 cup of pudding. Repeat with remaining cake
layers and pudding. Cover sides with pudding. Refrigerate cake; until
pudding is set.

with the Kahlua, because she tried and it wasn't as
good. Tip from Joan - Make sure you have lots of milk
on hand as the Dream Whip requires it too.

White Chocolate Pound Cake

deserts

1 tablespoon finely chopped pecans
1/2 pound unsalted butter, at room temperatur; e
2 cup sugar
1 cup heavy whipping cream
4 ounce finely chopped white chocolate, mel; ted and tepid
6 large eggs, at room temperature
3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda

FROM:      Derek Maddox (The Tally System - 912-328-6183 - (1:36)

Posting the recipe for that disgustingly rich chocolate pound cake the
other day reminded me of another favorite cake around our house. This
White Chocolate Pound Cake is a lot lighter than the other, and is
delicious with fresh strawberries or raspberries. I've even been
known to sneak a piece of this cake for breakfast (when the kids
aren't looking). The recipe comes from the "White Chocolate Cookbook"
by Janice Henderson. There's lots more where this came from if you
want them.

White Chocolate Pound Cake

Position a rack in the center and preheat oven to 300 deg F. Butter a
10 inch fluted tube pan.  Dust with flour; tap out the excess.
Sprinkle the pecans over the bottom.

Using an electric mixer set at medium speed, beat the butter in a
large bowl until light and fluffy, then add the sugar, 1 cup at a
time, beating well after each addition.

Blend in the cream and white chocolate.  Add the eggs, one at a time,
beating well after each addition.  Into a large bowl, sift the flour
with the salt and baking soda. Mix the flour mixture into the cream
mixture, 1 cup at a time, just until blended.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a cake tester
inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour and
15 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes. Transfer the cake in the pan to
a wire rack and cool 15 minutes.  Loosen the cake from the edges of
the pan with a metal spatula and invert onto the wire rack. Cool
completely. Through a fine-mesh sieve, sprinkle confectioners' sugar
over the top of the cake. store at room temperature, wrapped airtight.

One note on melting white chocolate:  Since the fats in white
chocolates melt at different temperatures, and since the milk
proteins tend to clump if overheated, melting white chocolate can be
very frustrating. I've found that the easiest method is to chop the
chocolate into small pieces and melt them in the microwave. Microwave
at high power for 1 minute, then stir. If necessary, continue the
process for additional 30-second intervals until completely melted.
Microwave only until smooth; DO NOT OVERHEAT!!!

Whatever you do, don't take this cake to work with you. I did that
once and have not had a moment's peace since. B-)

White Chocolate Whisper Cake

deserts

6 ounce white chocolate
4 1/2 large egg whites (4 full fluid ounces)
1 cup milk
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
3 cup (300 g) sifted cake flour
1 cup + 3 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon + 1-1/2 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
9 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened

FROM:      Derek Maddox (The Tally System - 912-328-6183 - (1:36)

Preheat oven to 350øF.  Grease and flour two 9 inch by
1-1/2    inch cake pans.

In a double boiler melt the chocolate over hot (not simmering) water,
stirring frequently. Remove from the water.

In a medium bowl lightly combine the egg whites, 1/4 cup milk, and
vanilla.

In a large mixing bowl combine the dry ingredients and mix on low
speed for 30 seconds to blend. Add the butter and remaining 3/4 cup
milk. Mix on low speed until the dry ingredients are moistened.
Increase to medium speed (high speed if using a hand mixer) and beat
for 1-1/2 minutes to aerate and develop the cake's structure. Scrape
down the sides. Gradually add the egg mixture in 3 batches, beating
for 20 seconds after each addition to incorporate the ingredients and
strengthen the structure. Scrape down the sides. Add the melted
chocolate and beat to incorporate.

Scrape the batter into the prepared pans and smooth the surface with a
spatula. The pans will be about 1/2 full. Bake 25 to 35 minutes or
until a tester inserted near the center comes out clean and the cake
springs back when pressed lightly in the center. The cakes should
start to shrink from the sides of the pans only after removal from
the oven.

Let the cakes cool in the pans on racks for 10 minutes. Loosen the
sides with a small metal spatula and invert onto greased wire racks.
To prevent splitting, reinvert so that the tops are up and cool
completely before wrapping airtight.

4 ounce unsalted butter; at room   temperature (1
1/4 cup vegetable shortening
2 cup sugar

2 tablespoon cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup milk
3 ounce unsweetened chocolate; chopped

      ----FROSTING----
4 ounce unsweetened chocolate
4 ounce unsalted butter (1 stick)
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
3 large eggs
3 cup confectioners' sugar

This is as close to the world famous Ebinger's Blackout Cake as you will
get.  This recipe was developed by Ceri E. Hadda - a professional baker and
food writer.

Preheat oven to 350F.

Make the cake.  Butter two 9-inch cake pans; dust them with flour and tap
out the excess.  Set aside. Stir the cocoa with some of the milk to form a
pasate. Stir in the rest of the milk, and beat with a whisk until the
mixture is smooth. Set aside.

In the bowl of an electric mixer combine the butter, shortening, sugar,
eggs, and vanilla; beat for 1 minute, or until the mixture is fluffy.

Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the
mixture, alternately with the cocoa mixture, to the contents of the bowl,
beating between additions. Begin and end with the flour mixture, and beat
only until the dry ingredients are absorbed. Divide
the batter between the cake pans and smooth the tops with a spatula to even
them.

Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the layers shrink from the sides of the
pans and the tops spring back when gently pressed with a fingertip. The
cake is dense and moist, so be careful  not to overbake it. Cool the layers
on wire racks for 10 minutes, then carefully invert them onto the racks.
Turn right side up and let cool completely.

Make the pudding.  Combine the sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a small heavy
saucepan.  Gradually add the milk, mixing thoroughly with a wire whisk.
Add the chocolate. Place over moderate heat and cook, stirring constantly,
until the mixture thickens and bubbles for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat
and stir in the vanilla. Pour into a small bowl and put plastic wrap or wax
paper directly on the surface to prevent a skin from forming.

Make the frosting.  Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler.
Remove it from the heat and cool slightly. In a medium bowl, beat the
butter, vanilla, and eggs until well mixed. The mixture will not blend
completely - do not worry.  Gradually beat in the sugar, about 2 Tbl at a
time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the melted chocolate. Chill
the frosting while assembling the rest of the cake, about 15    minutes.

Cut each cake layer in half horizontally, using a serrated knife. You now
have 4 layers, 3 for the cake assembly and 1 for the outside crumbs. Place
one of the layers in the food processor bowl and pulse-chop to make crumbs;
set aside.  (Or break it up with your
hands.)

Sandwich the remaining 3 layers with the chocolate pudding filling,
assembling the cake on a cardboard circle or the bottom of a springform
pan, if possible. Frost the side and top of the cake with the chocolate
frosting. Working over a baking sheet lined with
aluminum foil or wax paper, hold the cake in the palm of your hand. With
the other hand, gently press the cake crumbs all over the top and sides of
the cake, pressing them to adhere.  Pick up any crumbs that drop and press
them back on.

Chocolate Cherry Torte

cakes, deserts, tortes, holiday

      ----DRIED CHERRY FILLING and COFFE-
1 1/4 cup dried sour cherries (see note)
1 cup water
3 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
3 tablespoon marsala
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1/3 cup strong coffee
      ----CHOCOLATE CAKE----
1/4 cup boiling water
1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1/3 cup vegetable shortening
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/4 cup cake flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
6 tablespoon buttermilk
      ----CREAMCHEESE FILLING----
1 pkg (8-ounce) cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
1 cup (1/2 pint) heavy cream
1  chocolate meringue twigs (recipe fo; llows)
56  inches decorative ribbon (opt.)
1  fresh sweet cherries (opt.)

1. Prepare Dried Cherry Filling: In small saucepan, combine dried cherries,
water, and 2 tablespoon sugar. Beat mixture to boiling over high heat;
reduce heat to low and simmer cherries until soft and liquid is reduced by
half. Remove from heat and transfer half of cherry mixture to blender or
food processor fitted with chopping blade; process until a chunky puree
forms. Return pureed mixture to saucepan with remaining dried cherry
mixture; add cornstarch and stir until well blended. Heat mixture to
boiling, stirring constantly; cook until thickened. Remove from heat and
stir in 1 tablespoon Marsala and the lemon juice. Cool to room temperature.

2. Prepare Coffee Syrup: Combine coffee with remaining tablespoon sugar and
2 tablespoon Marsala; set aside.

3. Prepare Chocolate Cake: In small bowl, stir boiling water and cocoa
until smooth; set aside to cool to room temperature. Heat oven to 350'F.
Grease a 15 1/2 by 10 1/2-inch jelly-roll pan and line with waxed paper;
grease and flour paper.

4. In large bowl, with electric mixer at medium speed, beat sugar and
shortening until fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each
addition. Beat in vanilla and cooled cocoa mixture.

5. Into small bowl, sift flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Add
flour mixture to shortening mixture alternately with buttermilk, beating
until batter is smooth. Spread batter evenly in prepared pan and bake 18 to
20 minutes or until center springs back when gently
pressed. Cool cake in pan on wire rack 10 minutes. Invert cake onto wire
rack, remove waxed paper, and cool cake completely.

6. Prepare Cream-Cheese Filling: In large bowl, with electric mixer at
medium speed, beat cream cheese and confectioners' sugar 2 minutes. In
small bowl, beat cream until soft peaks form; fold whipped cream into
cream-cheese mixture just until blended. (Do not over-mix.)

7. To assemble torte, using the bottom of a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan as a
pattern, cut chocolate cake into three 9 by 5-inch rectangles; use leftover
cake trimmings for snacking. Line the inside of the loaf pan with plastic
wrap, allowing 2 inches to extend over the sides so assembled torte can be
easily removed from pan.

8. Place one cake rectangle in bottom of pan; brush generously with some
Coffee Syrup. Spread half of cheese filling on top of cake in pan. Place
another cake rectangle atop filling; brush with Coffee Syrup and top with
cherry filling. Place remaining cake atop cherry filling; brush with
remaining Coffee Syrup and top with remaining cheese filling, spreading
smoothly as this will be top of torte. Cover torte with overhanging plastic
wrap and refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight. Prepare Chocolate
Meringue Twigs.

9. To serve, remove torte from pan by pulling up plastic wrap on all sides.
Place torte on serving plate and gently pull plastic wrap to remove from
underneath. Gently press flat sides of chocolate twigs upright onto sides
of torte to cover completely. If desired, tie ribbon around sides of torte,
ending in a bow in the center of one long side. Top torte with fresh
cherries, if desired, and serve. Or refrigerate up to 2 hours before
serving. (Twigs will eventually soften with refrigeration.)

Chocolate Meringue Twigs: Heat oven to 275'F. Line 2 large baking sheets
with parchment paper (if not available, use aluminum foil and grease
lightly). Place 1/2 C sugar and 2 large egg whites in medium-size bowl. Set
the bowl in a larger bowl of very hot, not boiling, water. With portable
electric mixer at high speed, beat mixture until thick and nearly double in
volume. Remove bowl from hot water and continue beating egg whites until
very stiff peaks
form-about 4 minutes. Sift 2 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder over
meringue and fold in until blended. Transfer chocolate meringue to pastry
bag fitted with a 3/8-inch round tip. Making narrow rows, pipe 3 to 4-inch
long "twigs" of meringue onto baking sheets. Bake meringue twigs 1 1/2
hours or until dry and firm. Cool twigs completely on baking sheets on wire
racks. Meanwhile, melt 1 1/2 ounce bittersweet chocolate in microwave or
in bowl set over simmering water. Dip fork in melted chocolate and quickly
move it back and forth across twigs, creating thin chocolate stripes.
Refrigerate twigs just until chocolate stripes harden-about 5 minutes.
Gently remove twigs from parchment and store in airtight  ontainer,
unrefrigerated, until ready to use.

2 large egg whites; at room temperature ----c
      Bittersweet chocolate ----caramel r
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup water; divided
2 tablespoon dark rum --chocolate rain forest pr; aline ganache--
8 ounce bittersweet chocolate; finely chopped
      Heavy cream ----chocolate glaze----
6 ounce semisweet chocolate; finely chopped
3/4 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoon corn syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

praline:

Line a baking sheet with foil and butter lightly. Set aside. In a small,
heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and 1/4 cup of water. Cook the mixture
over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until the sugar
is dissolved. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring the sugar syrup to
a boil without stirring; cook the syrup until it caramelizes and turns an
amber color.

Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the toasted nuts, stirring for
about 1 minute. Pour the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet and allow
it to cool completely.

Make the rain forest cocoa meringue round:

1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 F. Line a
baking sheet with foil. Lightly butter the foil, dust with flour, and tap
off the excess. Using a small knife, trace one 9-inch circle on the baking
sheet.

2. In a food processor fitted with the metal chopping blade, combine the
toasted Brazil nuts, cashews and 4 tablespoons of the sugar. Process for 30
to 40 seconds, until finely ground. Add the flour and cocoa powder and
pulse on and off 4 or 5 times, until well blended.

3. In a grease-free, 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duly electric mixer, using
the whip attachment. whip the whites until stiff peaks form. Gradually add
the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar and whip until the whites are shiny
and stiff but not dry.

4. Sprinkle the nut cocoa mixture over the beaten whites, and using a
rubber spatula, quickly fold the mixtures until just blended.

5. Fill a pastry bag fitted with a medium plain tip (such as Ateco #5) with
the mixture. Pipe a spiral pattern of the meringue, about 1/2-inch thick,
into the outlined circle on the baking sheet. If there are any holes, pipe
meringue into the spaces, then using a small offset metal spatula spread
the meringue evenly.

6. Bake the rounds for about 25 minutes, until the edges begin to brown.
Remove the baking sheet to a rack and let cool completely. Carefully, peel
the aluminum foil off the bottom of the meringue.

Make the chocolate curls:

1. Temper the chocolate according to the directions for tempering. Spread
the tempered chocolate onto a clean, dry counter or work  surface.

Before the chocolate hardens, make the curls by holding a metal dough
scraper or 4-inch metal spatula at a 45 degree angle and pushing away from
you. The chocolate will curl upon itself. Using a bamboo skewer gently lift
the curls onto a foil-lined baking sheet and set aside until ready to
assemble the torte.

Make the caramel rum syrup:

1. In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar and 1/4 cup of water. Cook
the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon
until the sugar is dissolved. Increase the heat to medium-high and  bring
the sugar syrup to a boil without stirring; cook the syrup until it
caramelizes and turns an amber color.

1 teaspoon baking powder

1/4 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup butter or regular margarine
1 1/2 cup sugar

1 teaspoon vanilla
1 cup ; water
2/3 cup sauerkaraut; *
      ----CREAMY CHOCOLATE FROSTING----
1 ounce semisweet chocolate
3 ounce cream cheese; softened
1 tablespoon milk
1 cup confectioners' sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

*  Sauerkraut should be rinsed and drained thoroughly and then chopped
coarsely.

Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt; set
aside.  Cream together the butter and sugar in a bowl until light and
fluffy, using an electric mixer set at medium speed. Add eggs, one at a
time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Add dry
ingredients alternately with water to creamed mixture, beating well after
each addition.  Stir in sauerkraut.  Spread batter in greased 13 x 9 x
2-inch bakeing pan. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F. oven for 35 minutes
or until cake tests done. Cool in pan on rack. Frost with Creamy Chocolate
Frosting.  Cut into squares.

CREAMY CHOCOLATE FROSTING: Melt chocolate in a custard cup in hot water.
Cool slightly. Combine chocolate, cream cheese, milk, confectioners' sugar,
salt, and vanilla in a bowl. Beat with an electric mixer at high speed
until smooth and creamy.

NOTE: This is one of those dishes that sound absolutely horrible, but
tastes great. It is also one of those recipes that is a classic but you can
never find in most cookbooks.

I have fooled my kids with this as well as seen it done on TV. Everyone
thinks that the sauerkraut is coconut. So be sure to rinse and drain the
sauerkraut several times when you make this recipe.

Souffle Cake::  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Butter jelly roll pan of
approximately 15 1/2 x 10 1/2 x 1 inches; line pan with wax paper; allow
wax paper to extend over each end by about 2 inches. Set aside. Melt
chocolate with coffee in 200 degree oven, for about 10 minutes, or until
melted.  Cool.  Beat egg yolks with electric mixer until smooth. Gradually
add sugar and continue beating until mixture is pale yellow, about 5
minutes.  Stir in the cooled chocolate mixture. Beat egg whites with salt
until they form stiff peaks. Stir 1/5 egg whites into chocolate mixture to
lighten and then pour chocolate mixture into egg whites. Gently fold whites
and chocolate together until no white shows. Pour batter into prepared
jelly roll pan. Bake for 14 minutes. Truffle Cream:: Place chocolate in
bowl, and place in 200 degree oven for 15 minutes or until melted. Heat
heavy cream in saucepan until hot. Slowly pour hot cream over melted
chocolate, and stir until smooth and shiny. Strain mixture into bowl and
cool to room temperature. Tiles:: Place chocolate in bowl and place in 200
degree oven for 15 minutes or until melted. Place wax paper down the length
of a 17 x 14- inch baking pan. Secure end with dab of softened butter.
Pour melted chocolate on wax paper, and with a metal spatula spread it out
the length of the baking pan. Refrigerate chocolate for 1 hour. Remove
chocolate and leave it at room temperature for 5 minutes. Cut chocolate
into three strips, one 3 1/4 inches wide, and two strips 2 1/2 inches wide.
Cut strips crosswise into 3/4-inch sections to make tiles. Refrigerate
until needed. Refrigerate Truffle Cream, mixing bowl and beaters for 1
hour.

Over the top of the Souffle Cake, sift unsweetened cocoa. Cover the cake
(leave in pan) with a sheet of wax paper and cookie sheet. Invert cake onto
them. Remove jelly roll pan and wax paper. Slip out cookie sheet. Trim
rough edges of cake. Divide cake lengthwise into 3 equal strips about 3 1/4
inches each.  Remove the Truffle Cream, mixing bowl and beaters from
refrigerator.  Place 2 1/3 cups cream in mixing bowl. Return remainder to
refrigerator. Beat about 1 1/2 minutes. Place one strip of cake on cookie
sheet. Spread 1/2 of beaten cream on cake, top cream with second cake
strip. Place remainder beaten cream over top and cover with last cake
strip. Trim any rough edges and chill cake for 1/2 hour. Chill clean mixing
bowl and beaters. Beat remaining Truffle Cream in chilled bowl for 1 1/2
minutes. Remove cake from refrigerator and spread cream over top and sides.
Remove tiles from refrigerator.  Trim the tiles to fit height of cake.
Using sharp knife, separate 3 strips of tile. Place the 3 1/4-inch tile
over top of cake. Leave wax paper on. Place the two remaining strips along
sides of cake.  Try to align side and top tiles. Cover cake tightly with
aluminum foil and refrigerate over night.
Remove cake from refrigerator. Remove foil. Trim off ends of cake.  Place
cake on serving dish. Peel off strips of wax paper. Place narrow strips of
foil diagonally on top of cake to form pattern, and sift confectioners
sugar over it. Lift off foil. Serve with Creme de Menthe Custard Sauce.

Chocoltate Layer Cake

chocolate, deserts, passover

1  roger goodstein   (fcdk72b)
8  sheets egg matzah
1  chocolate frosting
1  white wine

Hello fellow passover chefs!!! Every year my mother-in-law has a large
first Seder (35 people) and every year we have the same food!!! I have
offered to bring a new carrot dish, does any one have a simple tasty dish
to serve with the main course? Below is a wonderful chocolate layer cake
recipe that is easy and fun for kids to help make:  dip one  sheet of
matzah in the wine and place on a platter, spread with frosting, continue
dipping and layering until you are satisfied with the height of your cake
and frost the outside and decorate with fruit or nuts or chocolate.
Refrigerate over night so the matzah has time to soften. Regarding the
frosting, you can make your own

Kosher for Passover version or you can use the store bought kind if you are
not too observant. I personally agree with sandi brooks, i follow Passover
tradition but not the strict law. Looking forward to your carrot recipes,

Fudge Cake With Milk Chocolate Frosting

cakes, eggs, spreads

1 pound milk chocolate
1/2 pound semisweet or extra-b ittersweet cho; colate
3/4 pound butter; softened ----fudge cake--
3 cup cake flour
2 cup light brown sugar
2 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup milk
3  eggs
1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 ounce unsweetened chocolate
6 ounce butter; softened

Recipe by: kdeck@epaus.island.net (Karen Deck)
PREPARATION:  FROSTING.  Chop both chocolates into coarse bits and melt in
a double boiler set over hot (not boiling) water.  Stir occasionally until
completely melted.  Remove pan from hot water and allow the chocolate to
cool until just no longer warm to the touch, about 20 minutes.  Place the
butter in a bowl and beat in the cooled chocolate until the mixture is
evenly blended, about 3 minutes.

Frosting can be stored at a cool temperature for up to 3 days, or several
months in the freezer.

Heat the oven to 350F.  Butter two 9-inch round cake pans and line them
with buttered and floured parchment paper or waxed paper.

FUDGE CAKE.  Sift the flour.  Measure 3 cups.  In a large bowl, mix
together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, breaking
up any lumps of sugar.

In a small bowl, whisk about 1/2 cup of the milk with the eggs and vanilla;
set aside.  Chop the chocolate into coarse bits and melt in a double
boiler set over hot (not boiling) water.  Combine the remaining cup of milk
and the butter with the mixed dry ingredients and beat for 1 ½ minutes,
scraping the sides of the bowl twice.  Add the egg mixture in 3 parts,
scraping the sides of the bowl and beating for 20 seconds after each
addition.  Add the melted chocolate and beat until just incorporated.

Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake in the center of the
preheated oven until the cake springs back when lightly pressed in the
center, 25 to 30 minutes.  Cool the cakes in their pans for 10 minutes and
invert onto racks.  Cool completely before frosting.

Frost the top surface of one layer of cake and top with the second layer.
Spread the remaining frosting on the top and sides of the cake. Make a
decorative pattern zigzag in the frosting by pulling a serrated knife
across the surface in a back-and-forth motion.  Use a small spatula or
spoon handle to pull out spikes of frosting all around the sides.

Cake can be completed a day ahead and refrigerated.

SERVING:  Return to room temperature if refrigerated.  Cut into wedges and
serve.

Makes one 9-inch cake.

and process until the nuts are ground to a fine powder. In a 4 1/2-quart
bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer using the paddle attachment, beat the
butter on medium speed until it is pale and soft peaks begin to form, about
3 to 5 minutes. Lower the speed, add the zest and the almond flour and mix
until well combined, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the reserved chocolate,
then the yolks, mixing just until combined.

In a dry, grease-free 4 1/2-quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer with
the wire whip attachment, beat the egg whites on low speed until frothy.
Increase the speed to medium and beat until soft peaks begin to form, 2 to
3 minutes, then gradually add the sugar. Increase the speed to high and
continue to beat until the whites are glossy and hold stiff peaks when the
whip is lifted, 1 to 2 more minutes.

Using a large rubber spatula, mix 1/3 of the whites into the
chocolate-almond-butter mixture to lighten it . Gently and quickly fold in
another third of the whites. Fold in the remaining whites. Scrape the
batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly with an offset metal
spatula. Bake for 30 minutes until the cake springs back when lightly
touched and the sides pull away from the pan. Cool in the pan for 10
minutes, then invert onto a cooling rack and remove the parchment paper.
When the cake has cooled, cut out 18 cake rounds using a 3-inch by 1 3/4-
inch metal ring mold. Set the cake rounds aside until ready to assemble the
dessert.

Make the milk chocolate-orange cream: Place the chopped chocolate into a
medium stainless steel bowl. In a medium saucepan, bring the cream to a
boil. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the cream over the chocolate.
Allow the mixture to stand for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate; whisk
gently until smooth. Stir in the orange liqueur. Refrigerate until
thoroughly chilled. When chilled, transfer the chocolate-cream to a 4 1/2
quart bowl of a heavy-duty electric mixer with the wire whip attachment.
Beat on medium speed until the mixture is light in color and soft peaks
start to form. Do not overbeat or the mixture will be grainy. Refrigerate
until ready to use.

Make the dark chocolate curls: Warm the chocolate slightly by placing it on
a piece of waxed paper in a microwave oven set on MEDIUM (50 percent)
power for 20 second intervals, until it begins to soften. This can take 3
to 6 tries, depending on the wattage of the microwave oven, type and brand
of chocolate and the heat of the kitchen. The chocolate should soften
slightly, not melt. Alternatively, soften the chocolate by placing it about
6 inches beneath the warm bulb of a desk lamp for 5 to 10 minutes, turning
it every couple of minutes, until it begins to soften.

Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Grip a square of chocolate with a
paper towel so your hand does not melt the chocolate. Using a sharp
vegetable peeler, scrape one side of the square of chocolate in a downward
motion, forming loosely shaped curls. As you form the curls, let the curls
drop onto the paper-lined baking sheet. (Chocolate that is only slightly
softened will form tight curls; overly heated chocolate will curl very
little.) Refrigerate the curls on the baking sheet until you are ready to
garnish the cakes.

Make the orange compote: With a sharp paring knife, peel the oranges and
cut them into segments. Cut each segment into 3 pieces. In a medium
saucepan combine the orange juice and the honey and bring to a boil over
medium heat. Reduce the heat and simmer until the juice begins to thicken
and turn syrupy, about 3 to 4 minutes.

Meanwhile, dissolve the cornstarch in the orange liqueur. When the orange
juice mixture has reduced, add the cornstarch mixture and whisk until the
mixture thickens. Simmer for 30 seconds; remove the pan from the heat. Fold
in the reserved orange segments. Set aside to cool.

Make the milk chocolate glaze: Place the chopped chocolate into a medium
stainless steel bowl. In a medium saucepan bring the heavy cream and corn
syrup to a boil. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the cream over the
chocolate. Stir in the almond liqueur. Assemble the cakes:

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange six 3- inch-by-1
3/4-inch metal rings on the paper. Place a cake round in the bottom of each
ring.

Fill a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tip (such as Ateco #5) with the
whipped milk chocolate-orange cream. Pipe a thin layer of the milk
chocolate-orange cream over the cake rounds. Press another cake round into
each ring, and repeat with a layer of the milk chocolate cream. Place the
final cake rounds into the ring and finish  the tops with the remaining
milk chocolate-orange cream. Using a metal spatula, scrape across the tops
of the rings to smooth and level the cream. Chill the cakes for 1 hour or
until firm.

Glaze the cakes: Using a damp (not wet) very hot towel, carefully heat the
outside of the metal rings and push the cakes up from the bottoms to
unmold. Arrange the cakes on a wire rack set over a baking sheet to catch
the excess glaze.

Pour the warm milk chocolate glaze over the cakes, coating each one
completely. Use a metal spatula to touch up any missed spots on the sides.
When the glaze has set slightly, decorate the tops with the dark chocolate
curls.

Serve the cakes at room temperature with the orange compote.

Six Minute Chocolate Cake

cakes, chocolate

1 1/2 cup flour
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup sugar
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1 cup old water -- or brewed
1  coffee
2 teaspoon vanilla extract -- (pure)
2 tablespoon vinegar

Preheat oven to 375.

Sift together flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt, and sugar into an
ungreased 8-inch square or 9-inch round cake pan. In a 2-cup
measuring cup, measure and mix together the oil, water or coffee, and
vanilla. Pour the liquid ingredients into the baking pan and mix the
batter with a fork or small whisk.  When the batter is smooth, add
the vinegar and stir in quickly. There will be pale swirls in the
batter where the vinegar is reacting with the baking soda.  Stir just
until the vinegar is evenly distributed throughout the batter. Bake
for 25 to 30 minutes.

To top the cake, I pureed a bag of (thawed) frozen raspberries and
added a few drops of lemon juice, then strained through a seive. I
was going to sprinkle some powdered sugar on top, but I realized I
didn't have any *yikes*, so i just mixed in a little regular sugar. I
spooned a little of this on top of each piece of cake (as well as
underneath it), and then sprinkled fresh raspberries on top.  It was
wonderful. The color of the pureed raspberries alone is enough to
make me love this dessert. The cake was great too-- wonderfully dark
and moist. A perfect contrast to the tartness of the berries.
