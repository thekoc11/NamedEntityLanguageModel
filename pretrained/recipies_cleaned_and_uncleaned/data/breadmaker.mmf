seeded and peeled ripe cantaloupe chunks, then heated. Place all
ingredients into the pan in the order listed, set darkness control at
10 o'clock Select white bread and push "Start." This is a soft,
sticky dough. If any of it clings to the sides ofthe pan at the end
of the first kneading, you can push it down with a rubber spatula.
This unbelievably delicious bread is based on an equally unbelievable
Texas treaconsisted of peeled cantaloupe segments arranged on a
serving plate in a sunburst pattem with bread cubes piled in the
center and covered with creamsauce, then dusted with paprika and/or
dotted with "red jelly." You can spread your own jelly on these
slices, perhaps over a layer of cream cheesefluffed with mashed
cantaloupe, to savor the full range often tantalizing tastes. Shared

      Title: Whole Wheat Dill Bread
 Categories: breadmaker
      Yield: 1 servings

      1 pk yeast; - or 2 1/2 tsp.
      2 c  whole wheat bread flour
  1 1/3 c  white bread flour
      1 tb gluten
      1 tb lecithin granules
    1/4 ts baking soda
  1 1/2 ts salt; - (i use light salt)
    1/2    ctn  eggbeaters; - or one 
           -egg - at room te
    3/4 c  non-fat cottage cheese
    3/4 c  plain non-fat yogurt
      3 tb sugar
      3 tb onion; minced dried
      2 tb whole dill seed
  1 1/2 tb olive oil; - or butter

Warm together the water; cottage cheese, yogurt, sugar, onion, dill
seed and oil in microwave for about 30 seconds or until warm to the
touch (about 110 deg). Set aside. Place all other ingredients above
into the bread pan in order listed. Add warmed ingredients. Select
white bread setting (other brands of B/M's may have a whole wheat
setting), but the white bread setting works on the DAK. Set
light/dark setting on side of B/M to 11 o'clock. Press Start. Open
lid after dough has kneaded about 2 mins. Press dough lightly with
fingertip. If wet, sticky dough adheres to your fingertip OR dough is
not forming into one soft ball (NO sticky dough on bottom of pan),
add 1 Tablespoon or more flour until dough is just slightly tacky and
makes one soft ball of dough. Judy Garnett --- Hope this does well
for you. I use my elec. knife to slice the bread top to bottom down
the center first. Then place the two cut sides down and slice them
thin. This makes a great sandwich bread or is good toasted with a
little diet margarine spread.  Best regards, Judy Garnett 11/07 11:18

 Categories: appetizers, breadmaker, jewish
      Yield: 12 servings

------------------------------------DOUGH-----------------------------------
      1 c  water
  1 1/4 ts salt
      1 ts sugar
      3 c  bread flour
  2 1/2 ts yeast

----------------------------------FILLING-----------------------------------
    1/3 c  feta cheese; grated
    1/3 c  parmesan or romano cheese

------------------------------------MISC------------------------------------
      1 oz vegetable oil; approx

Grate all cheeses. (You may use parmesan or romano cheese or a
mixture of both. Amounts are approximate.) Place some of the
parmesan/romano cheese in a small bowl. Mix the remaining cheeses
together. Make the dough using the "dough" cycle of the Breadmaker.
When done; take the dough out of the pan and squeeze out gasses. Make
12 balls of dough and place temporarily in a baking pan that is lined
with vegetable oil. One at a time, take each ball and spread or roll
(rolling pin is fine) into a six or seven inch circle. Place a
generous strip of the cheese mixture along one side and roll up like
a log. Gently make a coil out of each log. If necessary, seal the end
with a little water. Dip the top in some additional parmesan on an
ungreased cookie sheet. Repeat until all of the balls look like cute
little buns, then bake at 350 for 35 to 40 minutes or until lightly
browned. This recipe was adapted for the breadmaker from Mom's recipe
for Spinach Bulemas. I leave out the spinach because my husband,
Shelly, HATES spinach! As a part of our Sephardic (Jewish) family
tradition, Bulemas and hard boiled eggs are served before the main
meal on holidays and after returning from synagogue on Saturdays.

container so Herman can breathe. Herman doubles, even triples at time
of vigorous rising. Place Herman in a warm place overnight. Next day
refrigerate, loosely covered, and stir each day. This is very
important with Wheat'n'Honey Herman Starter as more gases form in the
container and are released during stirring. Formation of this gas may
cause the starter to appear darker on top before stirring each day,
but this is OK. On the 5th day measure out 1 c. Herman for baking and
another cup to give to a friend, if you wish, then feed the Herman
you have left, thusly: SEE ABOVE From day 5 on you may bake with
Herman any day you wish, always making sure you have one full cup
left for feeding. Feed Herman every five days. If you have a lot
left, feed him only 1 T. honey or brown sugar. If you have one cup or
a little more left, add the same ingredients as you did on the 5th
day.

* (don't use the crunchy kind) it looks too dry add a little more)
This is the receipt that was on the BB from CELESTE BEATIE (TDFX72B).
I don't deserve any credit for this wonderful bread.
Celeste used the DAK Auto Bakery and I use the DAK Turbo on the turbo
cycle. Turned out great. It is heavy (2 1/2 lbs.) I also used the
crunchy bacon bits but I soaked them in warm water for about 30
minutes. Only had to add 2 Tbsp of water to the 1-1/4 cup. All that
like this should thank CELESTE. FROM: C HAROLD QUINN (FPHK52A)

DOUGH SETTING Special instructions: If dough is too sticky because of
oil; add up to 1/2 cup flour by Tablespoons until you reach the
correct consistency.

After the dough has completed the first rising,remove from b/m and
punch down. Cover on lightly floured board and allow to rest 5-10
minutes.
Spray a 9x13x2 pan with Pam, or brush with olive oil. Briefly knead
dough and spread into pan, using hands to acheive a "bumpy texture".
Form a low ridge around the edge of the dough. Push dough into
corners. The bumps and ridge will allow the topping to stay in place.
Brush surface with olive oil.
You can cover and allow to rise, and bake  at this stage, or
continue on for Tomato & Cheese topping. TOPPING: Combine tomato
paste and spaghetti sauce. Spread on dough. Combine remaining
ingredients. Spread evenly over sauce. Press gently into dough. Cover
& allow to rise til doubled.
Preheat oven to 375.
Bake 25 minutes.
Slide out of pan onto cutting board. Cut into small pieces for

The trick to making 100% whole wheat bread in your machine is an extra
knead, which gives the yeast and gluten a second chance to create a
lighter loaf.  When your first knead cycle is completed, simply reset
the machine and start again.  Some manufacturers produce home
bakeries with a whole wheat cycle; if your machine doesn't have one,
this start- again method works as an easy alternative. SUCCESS HINTS:
The gluten gives the whole wheat flour the structure necessary for a
good loaf. If your market doesn't stock wheat gluten, try your local
health food store. Remember the extra knead.  It's especially
important in 100% whole wheat bread. Because of the extra knead, us
this recipe only on the regular bake cycle. CALORIES: 125 PROTEIN:

      Title: Basic Bread Machine Recipe
 Categories: breadmaker, breads, low-fat
      Yield: 1 loaf

  2 3/4 ts yeast
      1 ts malt
     11 oz water (110 - 120 deg.f)
      3 c  whole wheat flour
    1/2 c  unbleached white flour
      2 tb sugar, honey, molasses...
      1 ts salt
      2 tb gluten

put yeast and malt into machine with several oz. of water.  Use a
thermometer for the water. Too hot will kill the yeast. The yeast
will now proof (start to multiply) In a separate bowl, measure out
all dry ingredients and mix. After a few minutes, yeast should be
bubbling, add dry stuff and any liquids including the water. start
the machine and see how it looks. If too dry, add until it looks
right. Should be one big mass not several. Flour: I often substitute
1 cup of corn or rye + 1 heaping T of gluten for a cup of WW flour.
For sweet breads, add another few T of sugar (I commonly use honey,
molasses, or malt powder) and may some raisins. 3 T of carroway seeds
or sesame seeds in a non sweet bread is great. I have also added 2
mashed bananas, then cut the water.

      1 tb white sugar
     12 c  bread flour
     12 c  medium rye flour
      2 c  whole wheat flour

    1/2 oz unsweetened chocolate

(I would cut back on that a bit) Cool the mixture to 105-115 degrees
and add to dry ingredients. I suspect the exact ingredients don't
really matter all that much. As long as the flour-to-liquid
proportions are such as to make a dough of good consistency, the
result will probably be highly edible.

  2 3/4 c  whole wheat flour
      2 c  better for bread flour
      2 pk yeast
  1 3/4 c  water; warm
    1/2 c  molasses
    1/4 c  brown sugar
      1 tb salt
      2 tb caraway seeds
      2 tb shortening

------------------------------FOR BREAD MACHINE-----------------------------
      1 pk yeast
  1 3/4 c  whole wheat flour
      1 c  better for bread flour
      3 tb brown sugar
      1 tb caraway seeds
  1 1/2 ts salt
      1 c  water; very warm
    1/4 c  molasses
      1 tb shortening; melted

For Bread Machine:  Put the ingredients into the pan in the order
given. Select white bread. Choose high crust setting. Push Start.
This is a very moist cake-like bread, and one of our favorites. Makes
1 loaf. Scratch Method: Combine whole wheat flour and 1 cup of the
Better for bread flour, yeast and Caraway seed. Heat the water,
molasses, brown sugar, shortening and salt, just till warm, stirring
to melt the shortening. Add to the dry mix.  In an electric mixer,
beat at low speed for 30 seconds, then on high speed for 3 minutes.
Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a stiff dough. Knead
the dough until smooth and elastic. Shape in a ball and let rise in a
greased bowl, until doubled. I speed up the rising by placing the
bowl of dough in the overn with the light turned on. Punch the dough
down and divide in half.
Shape in 2 loaves. Let rise on a greased baking sheet, until double.
Bake at 375 degrees 30 to 35 minutes. If you like the crust really
chew, brush the bread with warm water during the last 10 to 15
minutes of the baking. Remove from the sheet and cool on racks. Makes
2 loaves I have made this bread for many years. It is almost like
eating cake! My husband said he couldn't tell the difference between
when I made this from scratch, and making it in the bread machine.

      Title: Seven Grain Bread
 Categories: breadmaker
      Yield: 16 servings

  1 1/4 c  water
    3/4 c  7 grain mix
      2 c  bread flour
    1/2 tb bread flour
    1/4 c  whole wheat flour
      2 tb sugar
      2 tb molasses
      1 ts salt
  1 1/2 tb powdered buttermilk
  1 1/2 ts yeast
  1 1/2 tb margarine

I bought a bag of "7-grain mix" (Stone-Burh) and came up with the
following recipe for the BM.  My goal was to come up with a "Poulsbo
Bread". This is very very close to the commercial product - only a
lot fresher tasting. About the only thing missing is sunflower seeds,
which I will try adding next time. I hope you like this. We ate an
entire loaf in one sitting (and there are only two of us!) Put
ingredients into pan in order listed. Bake at regular setting. One
more thing: this is a soft bread and will be difficult to slice when
hot. If you are going to use it in a sandwich, allow it to cool
first. Regards, *** Gaye in Bellevue, WA *** 10/01 01:34 pm

      Title: Brown Breakfast Bread
 Categories: breadmaker, quick
      Yield: 16 servings

  1 3/4 c  whole wheat flour
      1 ts baking soda
      1 ts ground ginger
      1 ts ground cinnamon
      1 ts allspice
      1 ds salt
      1 c  milk
    1/4 c  plus 1 tablespoon honey
    1/4 c  molasses
    1/2 c  raisins
      1 tb orange marmalade

Put all ingredients in order listed; select Sweet Bread>> and push
start. SPECIAL NOTE: This is not a yeast bread and does not rise very
high. The center of this may remain doughy but rest is good. You can
also reduce to 1 1/2 flour, 3T honey,3T molasses, 6 T raisins, 2 T
marmalade, 3/4 cup milk. Spices remain same. It makes a smaller loaf
but will be fully cooked. As I said I haven't  tried this but in
writing this for you the old glands began salivating and I guess I
will. Probably the variation. Then I think I will use yeast and
gluten and see what happens. As you have been dealing with DAK for at
least the >>> three years you have had your machine you know that he
gets carried away with each of his new "finds". I thought he was
going to keep this newsletter going for us but maybe other things
have his attention right now. I would think you could FROM: BRUCE

Because I am still so new at this *P BB I wrote my note in the wrong
place so here goes again!  My bread making is improving, thanks to *P
and B M Magic! I love the book. On a trip to New England I bought
bread in a town square, it was wonderful! Later I wrote the baker for
the recipe and she kindly sent it.  I've only tried it once (I'm new
to bread making). But now I'd like to try it in my BM.        (the
directions follow for assembling ingredients, etc. but since I want
to make it in my BM, I'm not including them.
Divide dough in two.  Divide each half into 3 and make 3 ropes.
Braid them and make into a circle. Attach both ends,repeat with other
half.

The bread was delicious and I would appreciate any help someone can
give me.  Until later, Renee N.C. San Diego

They don't really need to be chopped before placing in the

      Title: Naan For Breadmaker
 Categories: breadmaker, breads
      Yield: 12 servings

    1/2 tb yeast
      3 c  flour
    1/2 tb sugar
    1/2 ts salt
      2 tb butter
    3/4 c  yogurt

--------------------------------Water topping-------------------------------
      4 tb butter
      4 tb onions; chopped

A flat bread from India.  Make sure your oven is well preheated.

Use dough cycle on machine.  Remove dough from machine and divide
into 12 parts.

Preheat oven to 500.  Roll each part into a small circle (about 8"
diameter) and place on greased pizza or other baking pan. Brush top
of each one with melted butter and press finely chopped onion into
dough. Bake 10-15 minutes until puffy and brown.

Sylvia's notes: Yummmmmmmy!  However, 10 minutes in MY oven turned it
almost black; 5 minutes 30 seconds (at 475, since my oven runs a
little hot) turned the nan golden brown and perfect. Also, I rolled
it too thin at first.  They came out much better when I didn't roll
them paper thin, more like 1/8" thin.  I put spoonsful of
Yogurt-Cucumber Salad on them; this is the best bread I've ever
tasted for eating-food-on. However, as delicious as it is, I doubt
I'll make it often; all the rolling and brushing with butter and
pushing onions in is just too much work.

Donna German's note:  While traditional "Nan" has onions, try
substituting 1-2 ts lemon or orange peel, anise or fennel seeds. Just
sprinkle on top of melted butter.

 Categories: breadmaker, holiday

      2 tb butter
      1 ts salt
    1/4 ts nutmeg
    3/4 c  eggnog; at room temp.*

I adapted a recipe from my food processor bread book for my b/m for
the eggnog bread which you read about. Here is what I did; you may
need to make adaptations for whatever type of b/m you have. Play with
it, if it looks too sticky, add flour (1 tbsp. at a time.) If too
dry, add liquid, also one tbsp. at a time. Then let her rip!!!!!!!!
* Maybe as little as 1/2 c; (I took the chill off of it in
the microwave) Place ingred. in the B/M according to your
manufacturers' directions. Then adjust by adding flour or liquid as
needed This made a real moist, light lg. loaf. It rose to the top of
my breadmaker. I used the SWEET BREAD cycle and turned the lightness
or darkness button slightly lighter than the center mark (I have a
Welbilt). Let me know your results, we sure enjoyed it! FROM: LISA

           -(have at room te
      1 cn canned chopped green 
           -chilies; well-drained; *

I usually squeeze the chilies between a couple of layers of paper
towels to get rid of the excess moisture. If you don't want to use
green chilies, add about 1/2 tsp. of ground red pepper. Pour in all
ingredients (EXCEPT cheese and chilies) in the order listed (or if
your machine takes wet ingredients first, reverse the order) Select
white bread and push "Start". After the first knead, at the beeps,
add the chilies and the cheddar cheese. When the bread is finished
baking brush on some margarine or butter to the crust. I really enjoy
this best toasted. The original recipe is in the DAK catalog. I just
added some things to it to give it a little more zip. Judy Garnett

Title: SOURDOUGH (TC) PIZZA DOUGH
Categories: Breadmaker, Breads
Yield: 1 Crust

1 ts Active dry yeast
2 c  Bread flour
1/4 ts Salt
1 tb Olive oil
1 c  Sourdough starter
2 T  Water, if and as necessary

Watch the dough carefully and adjust the amount of water or flour if
necessary. Top with your favorite toppings.

Directions for Thin Crust doughs: Preheat oven to 500F for at least 30
minutes [I turn on the oven at the same time that I start the bread
machine ~-OLS] if using a pan and at least 1 hour if using a stone.
Grease the pizza pan with olive oil or spray it with a nonstick
vegetable spray. A light dusting of cornmeal to further prevent
sticking is optional - it usually adds a little crunch and flavor to
the dough. If using a peel and stone, dust the peel to prevent the
dough from sticking so that you may easily slide it off the peel and
onto the stone. While the dough is rising, prepare your topping and
grate your cheese; set aside. After the dough has risen 1 time, roll
it out on a lightly floured or cornmeal-covered (I prefer cornmeal)
countertop or handstretch the dough into a circle. Pick up the dough
and turn it over and roll or stretch from the center outwards until a
circle is formed. It may never be a perfect circle but that adds to
the uniqueness of your homemade pizza. Dust the dough only as needed
to prevent sticking with either flour or cornmeal. The thinner you
roll or stretch the dough, the thinner the crust. A thinly rolled
dough which does not rise a second time (after rolling) will give you
the thinnest, crispiest crust. Lay the dough on your prepared pizza
pan or peel. Pull the dough up around the edges of the pan so that a
slight lip is formed, and crimp the edges. For a thin, crispy crust,
place your toppings on the pizza and bake immediately. For a thicker,
chewier crust, allow the dough to rise for 15 to 30 minutes. The
longer the rise, the thicker the dough. Place your toppings on after
this second rising and then bake. The toppings should be placed in
such a way that the rim is left unadorned (about 1/4 to 1/2 inch
border is good). This prevents spillage when baking and gives a nice
piece of crust to hold when eating. Place the pizza on the bottom
rack of the oven or directly on the pizza stone and bake until the
crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted. If the oven was
properly preheated, it should only take 5 to 10 minutes to bake a
thin crust pizza.

PRECOOKED SHELLS - Make extra pizza dough, roll it out and place it
on the pan, screen or peel. Brush it with olive oil (or melted garlic
butter) and pierce the dough every 1/2 inch or so with a fork (to
prevent bubbles) [Note: The poking part is no joke, and not an
option, unless you *want* to pull a big puffy balloon out of the
oven. It's not as vital when you're topping the dough and putting it
directly in the oven. --OLS] Bake the shell in a preheated 500F oven
for about 5 minutes. Allow to cool, stack with waxed paper in between
[foil works fine for me], wrap it well in plastic and freeze for up
to 1 month. To use, remove dough from freezer (it is not necessary to
thaw but you may), brush dough with oil to prevent sogginess [I
haven't noticed any trouble without the oil], top as desired and bake
in a preheated 450F oven for 15 to 20 minutes.

If you want a very thin crust and end up with excess dough, simply
form it into bread sticks, brush with a little water and sprinkle
some kosher salt, poppy seeds or sesame seeds on top. Bake them right
beside your pizza. [Other options that I've tried with success: salt
and vinegar, garlic powder, and/or a little cayenne --OLS]

      Title: Rolls (Brotchen)
 Categories: breadmaker, rolls
      Yield: 12 rolls

--------------------------FORMATTED BY JOYCE BURTON-------------------------
      1 ts sugar
      1 ts salt
      1 pk active dry yeast
      1 tb oil
      1 c  warm water
      1    egg white

Pour 2 1/2 cups flour into a large bowl and make a well. Pour yeast,
sugar, and two tablespoons of warm water (the water comes from the 1
cup listed above) in the well. Mix yeast, sugar and water carefully
within the well. Do not mix with the flour at this time. Cover the
bowl with a cloth and set it in a warm place for 15 minutes. Add the
remaining water and oil and beat until mixed.  Turn out on counter
top and knead until smooth. Add the remaining 1/2 cup flour as
needed. Put dough in a bowl, cover, and let it rise until double in
size. Punch down and divide the dough into 12 parts. Shape into oval
rolls and place 3" apart on a greased and floured cookie sheet. Cover
and let rise until double in size. Beat egg white and 1 teaspoon
water with a fork until frothy and brush on the rolls. Bake in a
preheated oven at 450 for 15 to 20 minutes until golden brown.

Joyce's notes:  I made the following changes and mixed on the dough
cycle in my Zoji.  I used 3 cups of flour and increased the water to
1 1/8    cup.

      Title: Gaye's Sourdough Tips
 Categories: breadmaker, breads, sourdough
      Yield: 1 servings

      1    no ingredients

	   From: Gaye Levy ** DTXT63A

You will find that your sourdough breads will have more "tang" and
will rise higher in the BM if you follow this procedure: * Remove a
cup )or more) of your starter from the fridge and bring to room temp.
* Feed with 1 cup flour and 1 cup (or slightly less) water * Let the
starter do its thing. It will become bubbly and foamy. Watch for its
'peak'. This usually occurs 8 to 10 hours after feeding. It is best
to keep the starter warm (75 to 85 degrees). If it cold out, leave it
in the oven with the light turned on! * Make your bread during the
peak...while the starter is VERY active. * Dump the unused starter
back into the mother pot. Following this method, you can even make
sourdough in the b/m without yeast. Really! *Variation: Separate your
starter into two batches. Create a "beer" starter with one batch. You
will feed this pot with flat beer and flour instead of water and
flour. A very unique and delicious taste! * To create your own
sourdough recipe: 	 Substitute 7/8 cup start for 1 cup liquid Reduce
flour by 1/4 to 1/2 cup

  1 3/4 ts salt

Add all ingredients in the order suggested by your bread machine
manual and process on the basic bread cycle according to the
manufacturer's directions.  For DAK/Welbilt, use White bread setting.
Let the loaf cool before slicing.  Serve plain or toasted.
"This is good bread for a steak sandwich, French dip roast beef,
or a grilled mozzarella cheese and tomato sandwich.  Baking the
garlic right in the bread lightens the garlic flavor.  If this is not
a strong enough garlic statement for you, add another clove."

      2 tb sugar
      2 tb margarine or butter
      4 ts amaretto or hazelnut liqueur
    3/4 ts active dry yeast
    1/2 ts salt
      1    recipe amaretto glaze
      1    toasted chopped hazlenuts or
      1    almonds (optional)

-------------------------------AMARETTO GLAZE-------------------------------
    1/2 c  sifted powdered sugar
      1 tb amaretto or hazelnut
      1    liqueur
      1    *or*
      1 tb almond extract
      1    to 2 tablespoons milk *if
      1    needed

Serve slices of this nutty sweet breat for breakfast, brunch, or an
afternoon coffee break --

BREAD DIRECTIONS: Add flour, milk, the nuts, egg, sugar, margarine or
butter, liqueur, yeast, and salt to the bread machine according to the
manufacturer's directions.  Bake and cool as directed.  When brread is
cool, drizzle with Amaretto Glaze.

AMARETTO GLAZE: In a small mixing bowl combine sugar, amaretto or
hanelnut liqueur *OR* almond extract.  If needed, add 1 to 2
teaspoons milk to make of drizzling consistency.

BREAD MACHINE BASICS: These helpful tips apply to all types of bread
machines: Bread flour, which is high in protein, works best for
breads made in a bread machine.  You can use other grains or flours
with the bread flour but not in place of all of it.  Some recipes
also call for a small amount of gluten flour.  This helps breads,
especially those made with low-gluten flours (such as whole wheat
flour), hold together.

Add ingredients to the bread machine in the order specified by the
directions in the owner's manual.

To use powdered milk instead of fresh, add 1/3 cup nonfat dry milk
powder for each 1 cup of water and add it with the flour.  Always use
powdered milk when using the timer on your machine.

      Title: English Muffin Bread (For Bread Machines)
 Categories: breadmaker, breads
      Yield: 6 servings

  1 1/4 c  water
      2 ts sugar
      1 ts salt
    1/4 ts baking soda
      3 c  bread flour
      3 tb nonfat dry milk
      2 ts yeast

Note: Ingredients are for Large Loaf (about 1.5 lbs), adjust # of
servings for Medium or Small loaf.

Put all ingredients in machine in the order suggested by your
machine's manufacturer and fire that bad boy up on the regular bread
cycle. The top of the loaf should come out sunken, this is normal.

The texture and taste is just like English Muffins, this is GREAT for
toasting!

Put all ingredients but the raisins in your machine in the order

"Mix" or "Fruit" breads that will make them beep when it's time to
add the fruit. Add the raisins at the proper time.

The "Variations" can be used instead of the raisins, add at the time
you'd add the raisins.

loved it. Save this recipe to use up your Thanksgiving/Christmas

      Title: Cinnamon Twist Bread
 Categories: breadmaker
      Yield: 1 pound loaf

      6 oz buttermilk or powder
      3 tb honey
      1    egg
      2 tb butter
  2 1/4 c  bread flour
      1 tb sugar
    1/2 ts ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts salt
      2 ts yeast

Put all the ingredients in the pan.   Start the bread machine. Cover a
bread board with plastic wrap and dust with flour. When the machine
stops kneading, remove the dough from the container with your hands,
leaving the bread pan in place in your machine and close the lid.
Place dough on floured board.   Dust top of dough and your hands with
flour. Pat dough into a 6"x 10" rectangle. Combine 2 teaspoons
cinnamon and 1 tsp. sugar. Spoon mixture in three long rows, down the
dough. Roll dough into a fat cylinder, left to right, then fold it in
half twisting the ends together.
Place the dough, ends down, back in the bread machine, close the lid
and continue the cycle.

be sure to keep the machine closed while you are putting the cinnamon
on so any heat in the machine stays in.   Work as quickly as possible
because the machine still ticks off the time while you're doing it.

I use powdered butter milk, 3 tb and 6 oz warm water.  I have left
out the egg and reduced the flour to 2 c with great success.  I have
also replaced the honey with sugar.  I have also reduced the amount
of sugar in the dough to 2 tb and found it to be sweet enough. In
other word, the basic recipe is great, but modifications don't seem
to bother it. Remember, you will be playing with the dough, so don't
worry if the dough is sticky at first, you will be adding some flour
when rolling it out. Have fun and enjoy. Submitted By  EWILIKERS POUR

      Title: Party Mix Wheat Bread
 Categories: breadmaker
      Yield: 2 servings

    1/2 tb yeast
      3 c  whole wheat flour
  1 1/2 ts seasoned salt
      2 tb powdered milk
      2 tb oil
      3 tb molasses
      2 tb worcestershire sauce
  1 1/8 c  water; hot tap

Pile everything into the machine in the order listed. Select the bread
cycle.  Remove at the end of the cooling cycle.  The flavors of the
seasonings are most pronounced when the bread is allowed to cool
completely.

Variations:

HIGH-SPEED PARTY MIX WHEAT BREAD  (Hitachi and Regal machines)

Use 2 t active dry yeast and select the "BREAD RAPID" setting.

PARTY MIX WHITE BREAD

Substitute sugar for the molasses and bread flour for the whole wheat
flour.  If you object to the strange tint that the Worcestershire
sauce will give the dough, use Lea & Perrin's White Wine
Worcestershire sauce. Hitachi and Regal owners who want to use the
"BREAD RAPID" cycle can use 2 t of active dry yeast.

Sylvia's comments: With WW flour, this barely rose and then cratered.
With all bread flour, it mushroomed.  I hoped this would taste like
Chex Party Mix; it just tasted like bread.  Looked like WW because of
the Worcestershire but still tasted white.

NOTE:  I rewrote the recipe to follow order of my machine. It works
wonderfully in my Panasonic.

This bread tastes like stuffing!  It is WONDERFUL!!!! Here are some
hints from the book: 1. Use dried herbs that are flaked and not
ground. If using ground, reduce the amt. by half. If using fresh
herbs, double the recipe. 2.  This recipe can be made with the
regular, rapid, or delayed time bake cycles.

This recipes comes from "Bread Electric" from the Innovative Cooking
Enterprises.  I make the regular size loaf in my machine. Marilyn

      Title: Cinnabon Cinnamon Rolls
 Categories: breadmaker, desserts, rolls
      Yield: 12 rolls

      4 tb melted butter
      4 tb water
    1/2    box instant vanilla pudding 
           -(1/2 of; a 3.4oz. box)
      1 c  milk
      1    egg; (beaten)
      1 tb sugar
    1/2 ts salt
      4 c  bread flour
  2 1/2 ts active dry yeast fill with:
    1/2 c  softened butter
      1 c  brown sugar
      2 ts cinnamon

ROLLS: Place ingredients in machine following the specifications of
that particular machine.  Set for dough cycle (about 1 hr. 40 minutes
in my Hitachi B101 ~ Debbie Carlson). After complete on dough cycle,
remove from machine & roll out to 17 x 10 (approx) rectangle.

FILLING: Mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. Spread softened
butter over dough. Sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon mixture over
top. Roll tightly from long end, pinching edges closed when
completely rolled. Slice rolled dough into 1/2" slices (or larger if
a larger bun is preferred ).Place into greased cake pans. ( I use 3 -
9" pans ) I usually get 19 - 20 buns from this. Let rise until
doubled. Bake at 350 for 15 - 20 minutes, until golden. Do not
overbake. FROST with: 4 oz cream cheese (softened) 1/4 C butter
(softened) 1 1/2 C confectioners sugar 1/2 tsp vanilla 1 1/2 tsp milk

SPREAD on very warm rolls.  They are best when eaten fresh, but we
have found that 10 - 15 seconds in the microwave rejuvenates them!

Note:  I made these in my Hitachi B101 and the dough turned out
beautifully!  I added chopped nuts to the filling though and doubled
the cinnamon.  I also sliced my rolls about 1" and placed them in a
non-stick 13x9" baking pan which rendered about 10 large rolls. Also,
because I don't care for a cream cheese frosting, I used 3 cups
powdered sugar, 4 Tbsp. softened butter, 1 tsp. vanilla and about 3
Tbsp. milk which made lots of frosting, perhaps too much. (Debbie

Select light crust setting, Press start. Cool on rack for 1 hour.

I have found that adding gluten really gives me a tall loaf and I
always mix my dries together first and knead cycle first, then set
the bread cycle so that you get a double kneading cycle. This works
well on my Hitachi but be the judge for your brand of breadmaker.

I am particularly fond of this bread as it reminds me of the true rye
breads I've had years before and I haven't found a recipe like it
until I tried this. Marty Markus, in OR

      Title: Bread Fat Substitute - Applesauce
 Categories: apples, breadmaker, breads
      Yield: 1 servings

      1    no ingredients

Try substituting unsweetened applesauce for the fats called for in
your bread recipes. This even works with chocolate cake! Many can't
tell any difference in taste and the pectin in the applesauce keeps
the bread moist longer. I buy the small Motts individual containers
so I don't have a large jar going bad in the fridge. I've read that
you can use up to one tablespoon of applesauce per cup of flour. If
you do make this substitution hold out about 1/8 to 1/4 cup of the
liquid in the recipe and add it back in a tsp. at a time during the
kneading cycle.

      Title: Sourdough Starter And Bread
 Categories: breadmaker, breads, sourdough, starter
      Yield: 1 servings

      2 c  skim milk
      2 c  bread flour
      1 pk yeast

Place milk in a glass container and allow to stand at room
temperature for 24 hours. Stir in flour and yeast. Leave uncovered in
a warm place for 2-5 days, depending on how long it takes it to
bubble and sour. If it starts to dry out, stir in enough tepid water
to bring it back to the original consistency. Once it has a good sour
aroma and is full of bubbles, it is ready to use. Try to maintain
about 1 and 1/2 cups of starter. Each time part of the starter is
used,

replenish with a mixture of equal parts milk and flour. Leave at room
temperature several hours or overnight, or until it begins to fill
with bubbles. Then cover and store in refrigerator. Starter is best
if used at least once a week. If starter isn't, used for 2 or 3
weeks, spoon out and discard about half and replenish as described.
Given attention, a starter becomes more flavorful with age. Starter
can be frozen if it is not to be used for several weeks. This will
slow down yeast action and should be left at room temperature for 24
hours after thawing. Sourdough Bread: 2/3 cup skim milk 1 cup
sourdough starter 3 cups bread flour 2 Tbs.sugar 2 tsp. lite salt 1 &
1/2 tsp. yeast 2 Tbs. liquid Butter Buds Combine above thoroughly
(using half of the flour) and let stand uncovered to ferment
overnight in a warm place. Next morning, after the mixture has risen
and fallen, stir down any crust that may have formed. Add the rest of
the flour. When thoroughly mixed, turn out onto a board covered with
a little flour so it won't stick. Shape dough into 2 loaves, put into
bread pans, brush lightly with liquid Butter Buds, and let rise
covered until almost doubled in size. Bake in a pre-heated 400F. oven
45-50 minutes. Note: This recipe works GREAT in a bread machine.
Simply put all of the ingredients in the machine, adding the dry
ingredients first. Yields: 2 loaves (24 slices)

      Title: Fleischmann's Sourdough Starter *
 Categories: breadmaker, breads, sourdough
      Yield: 1 servings

-------------------------------PATTI  VDRJ67A-------------------------------
      2 c  water; lukewarm (105-115~)
  3 1/2 c  all purpose flour
  2 1/4 ts bread machine yeast -=or=-
      1 pk active dry or rapid yeast

In large 2 quart container, combine flour and yeast. Gradually add
water and beat until smooth. Cover loosely; let stand in warm place
until bubbly and sour smelling, about 2-4 days. Trasfer to 2 quart or
larger plastic container with tight fitting lid. Refrigerate until
ready to use.

TO KEEP STARTER ALIVE: Once a week, stir in 1 tbls flour and 1 tbls
lukewarm water. Beat until smooth. Cover loosely and let stand until
bubbly, 12-24 hours. Cover tightly; refrigerate until ready to use.

TO REPLENISH STARTER: For each 3/4 cup (1-1/4 cup) used, add 2/3 cup
(1 cup) flour and 2/3 cup (1 cup) lukewarm water. Beat until smooth.
Cover loosely and let stand until bubbly, 12-24 hours. Use or cover
tightly and refrigerate until ready to use.

SOURDOUGH TIPS: The sourdough starter should be the consistency of
thin pancake batter; if needed, add enough water to get desired
consistency before using. To assure accuracy, measure the starter
while it is still chilled, then let it come to room temperature
before using. It expands when warm. Submitted By GOOD FOOD 3/87

      3 c  flour, all purpose
      3 tb sugar

----------------------------------TOPPING-----------------------------------
    1/4 c  butter; melted
      1 cl garlic; crushed
      4 tb parmesan; grated

Ingredients above are for a 1.5 pound loaf pan, although since these
rolls are made on the dough cycle, I find that I can put the 1.5
pound amount of ingredients in the 1 pound machine with no problem
since it's not going to bake.  1 pound ingredients are listed below.
Place roll ingredients into bread machine on dough setting and press
start. When dough is finished, remove from machine. Turn out dough
onto a floured countertop or cutting board.  Gently roll and stretch
dough into a 24 inch rope.

Greast an 8-inch pie pan.

With a sharp knife, divide dough into 18-24 pieces. Shape into balls
and place into pie pan. In a small bowl, combine butter and garlic.
Pour over rolls. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese. Cover and let rise in
warm oven 30-45 minutes until doubled. Remove rolls from oven.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Put rolls in oven, bake for 10-15
minutes until golden on top. Remove from oven, cut apart and spread
with butter to get "yummies" in your tummies! Submitted By

      1 c  water
  1 1/2 tb canola oil
      2 tb honey
    1/2 ts salt

  1 1/2 c  bread flour
  1 1/2 ts yeast
    1/2 c  chopped dates
    1/2 c  chopped almonds

The dates and almonds can be added at the beep, but I usually add
them at the very beginning for better distribution. We like this
spread with cream cheese, but it's also good just as it is! I always
keep the machine open at the very beginning kneading and add flour by
the tablespoon as is neaded until it's no longer sticky. Living in a
high humidity climate sometimes I need to add quite a lot when I
don't cut down the liquid. Guess I should be keeping an eye on the
humidity before I begin baking! Thanks for your recipe.  We used to
live near Lancaster. Rhonda

to make 1 1/2 cup milk.  Stir, then add lemon juice, then add enough
water to make the 1 3/4 cup measure.

If you do not have all the different kinds of flour, use what you do
have to make 3 1/4 cups, or try 1/4 cup wheat germ or bran plus 3 cups
all-purpose flour.  Make a note of the ingredients and a note of the
result.

Sugar could possibly be left out, especially if 2 tbsp. or more of
raisins (or finely chopped dates) are used.

Combine dry ingredients in a bowl.  Cut in margarine or oil.  Stir in
raisins (if using) and add buttermilk or sour milk to make a soft
dough.

Knead lightly on a floured surface until smooth.  Place on a greased
baking sheet and flatten into a circle about 2 1/2 inches thick. Cut
large X about 1/4 inch deep on top.  OR make 2 smaller loaves.

Bake at 350 F for about 1 hour or until toothpick inserted in the
center comes out clean.

      Title: Whole Wheat Irish Soda Bread
 Categories: breadmaker, breads, ethnic
      Yield: 12 servings

  1 1/8 c  bread flour
  1 1/8 c  whole wheat flour

The only difference besides the whole wheat flour, is that this
recipe has no sugar at all...wonder why!? My Panasonic machine has a
setting for making  Whole Wheat Bread and this recipe is for making
the Whole Wheat Irish Soda Bread that I tried yesterday.  It was a
big hit!! BETTIE COOPER (VGXB82A)

      Title: Sourdough Starter
 Categories: breadmaker, breads
      Yield: 1 servings

      1    hkds25a
      4 c  lukewarm water
      1 pk activated dry yeast
      1 tb vinegar; very important<
    1/4 c  sugar
      5 c  unbleachd flour

Pour the water into a crock or a wide mouth gallon jar. Pour in the
yeast and let it dissolve. Stir. Add vinegar, sugar and flour. Mix.
Cover w/cloth and set in a warm place to sour..(2 to 3 days). When
activity STOPS, the mixture flattens out. An amber colored liquor
comes to the top..And it SMELLS.. THAT'S IT! Mix it up. It will look
like whipping cream. Put it in a GLASS JAR with a screw type lid;
place in refrigerator. IT WILL KEEP FOR MONTHS. Growing better as it
continues to age at a very slow pace. I have no idea regarding
conversion for use in BM. IF YOU DO.. Let ME know..Ho-Kay? It is
super in pancakes; waffles; coffee cake; rolled bisquits; quick drop

      Title: Sourest Sourdough
 Categories: breadmaker, breads
      Yield: 1 loaf

  1 1/4 c  sourdough starter
    1/2 c  water
      3 c  bread flour
      1 tb olive oil
      2 tb sugar
      1 ts salt
      2 ts yeast

Set starter out on counter and bring to room temperature. Feed as you
normally do and allow to become foamy and active. This will take 8 to
12    hours.

Put all ingredients in the B/M and set on the dough cycle. When the
cycle is complete, remove dough and squeeze out gases. Cover with a
damp towel and let it rest for 20 or 30 minutes. (This rest period
makes the dough more pliable.)

Sprinkle corn meal on a board and shape dough into two cylindrical
loaves. Place loaves on a cornmeal covered baking sheet or in a
special "baguette pan" that can be purchased at a kitchen store.
Cover again with the damp towel and put in the refer for 12 to 24
hours. Take dough out of the refer, sprinkle with water, and let it
sit out until the loaves are fully risen. (They will usually rise a
little in the refer, too.)

Spray again with water then bake at 375 for 30 minutes or until brown
and crusty. If you want a really crusty bread, spray the loaf with
water every five minutes while baking. This harder to describe than
it is to do ... and the results are worth it!

PLEASE NOTE: Depending on the temperature, humidity, and the whim of
the starter, the bread will vary from batch to batch. Sometimes it is
very sour and dense while other times it is mildly sour and fluffy
inside. Each batch is unique...but it is always good. I found that
using the special pan helped the baguettes keep their shape. The pan
is well worth the fifteen bucks.

You can also vary the flavor of the bread by using more or less sugar
or by substituting 1 TBL of vinegar for 1 TBL of water. Another
variation is to use flat beer instead of water in either the recipe
or when feeding the starter.  (Be sure to separate your starter into
two batches first so that you do not contaminate the orignal pot.)

Everytime I share this recipe, I get notes saying this is the beat
sourdough ever!

      Title: Dough Enhancer
 Categories: breadmaker
      Yield: 32 servings

      1 c  lecithin granules
      1 tb vitamin c powder
      1 tb ginger, ground

------------------------MESSAGE BREADBAKERS.V097.N0-------------------------

--------------------------END BREADBAKERS.V097.N024-------------------------

Mix all ingredients and store in tightly closed glass jar.

Add to breadmaker in amount equal to yeast with other dry ingredients.
Start machine.

Apparently, the ginger gooses the yeast and makes it act more
swiftly, the ascorbic acid strengthens the gluten, and the lecithin
aids the oil in causing the strands of gluten to slip against each
other more easily and thus rise better.

THE BREADMACHINE COOKBOOK IV by Donna Rathmell German has a section
titled "Dough Enhancers" and in that section it mentions Lecithin.
"Lecithin is a food supplement which is obtained from oil in egg
yolks or soy beans. It improves moisture   and assists in expansion
and elasticity of the bread dough. Add between 1 and 1 1/2 tsp. of
lecithin granules per cup of flour."

 Categories: breadmaker, breads
      Yield: 1 servings

      2 ts yeast or 1/2 a package
      2 c  bread flour
      1 tb sugar
    1/2 ts salt
    1/8 ts baking soda
      1 c  sour cream
    1/4 c  water

Add all the ingredients to the machine in the order listed. Choose
either regular or light crust ( depending on your preference ) and
push start.

NOTES : When the machine was in rest mode I tested the dough and the
texture was like silk to the touch and when baking the aroma was
heavenly. We had a slice as soon as it was out of the machine, melt
in your mouth softness. Highly recommended. Be sure to use real sour
cream, no low fat or non fat.

      Title: Big Soft Pretzels
 Categories: breadmaker, breads, kids, mixes, snacks
      Yield: 1 servings

      1 tb dry yeast
      5 c  bread mix; up to six 
           -lukewarm water
      2    eggs; beaten

----------------------------------TOPPING-----------------------------------
      1    egg; beaten
      2 tb coarse salt
    1/2 c  butter; melted

Lightly grease 2 large baking sheets.  In a large bowl, dissolve
yeast in lukewarm water.  Blend in 2 eggs and butter. Add 5 cups
bread mix. Stir well.  Add additional bread mix to make a soft, but
not too sticky dough. Knead about 5 minutes until dough is smooth.
Roll pieces of dough into ropes about 1/2 inch in diameter and 18 to
24 inches long. Form into pretzel shapes.  For pretzel sticks, cut
dough into 5 to 6 inch lengths. Place on prepared baking sheets.
Preheat oven to 425.

Brush tops of pretzels with beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse salt.
Bake immediately 12 to 15 minutes, until brown and crisp. Makes 12 to
15    large pretzels.

Variation For a chewier pretzel, drop pretzel-shaped dough into a pan
of boiling water.  When dough floats to the top of the water, remove
it. Preheat oven to 400. Brush with egg and sprinkle with coarse
salt. Bake about 30 minutes.

All of these recipes I have posted using my bread mix can be adjusted
to use with the bread machine, some using the dough setting. I have
had excellent results. Will try to post more over the weekend as I
get time. Also have a lot of other "mix" recipes if anyone is
interested.

      Title: Auntie Anne's Pretzels
 Categories: breadmaker, breads
      Yield: 1 servings

  1 1/2 ts yeast
    1/2 ts brown sugar
      1 ds salt
  1 1/2 c  water
      4 c  bread flour
      2 ts baking soda

      Title: Pretzels-A
 Categories: breadmaker, breads
      Yield: 18 servings

      1    (pretzels):
  2 1/2 ts yeast
      4 c  flour
    2/3 ts salt
  1 1/3 tb sugar
  2 1/2 tb margarine; or butter
  1 1/3 c  water

(WATER FOR 'BATH):
4 c  Water; at a simmer
5 ts Baking soda

Add into the bread machine in this order.  Set on manual. FORMING: Cut
dough into short strips, roll into ropes and shape into pretzels.
Cover with a tea towel and let rise for 45 minutes. 'BATH': In a cast
iron or OTHER NONALUMINUM pan, bring almost to a boil 4 cups of water
and 5 teaspoons of baking soda. Gently place (by hand or using
slotted spoon) the
pretzels into the water for approximately 15 seconds on each side
turning once.  Do NOT let water come to a boil. Remove pretzels and
place on a greased baking sheet. Sprinkle with coarse salt (kosher).
Bake at 475 for
12    minutes.

NOTE: In my oven it took only about 10 minutes so watch carefully. Do
NOT make the strips too fat; they really puff up. If you are on a
salt-free diet use sesame, poppy, garlic; whatever you like on the
outside...the WHOLE family, both upstairs and downstairs loved them
and the DAK did all the hard work.
* If you use a machine that needs the water first add ingredients in
reverse order. FROM: Donna German's THE BREAD MACHINE COOKBOOK I and

Measure carefully, adding ingredients in bread machine pan in the
order recommended by the manufacturer - except cherries, raisins or
currants and almonds.  Select Sweet or Basic/White cycle.  Use Light
or Medium crust color.  Add red and green candied cherries, raisins
or currants, and almonds at the raisin/nut cycle or 5 minutes before
last kneading cycle ends.  The dough becomes VERY SOFT and WET in
appearance at this point! DO NOT add flour, as the bread will become
tough.

Remove baked bread from pan and cool on wire rack. PER SERVING: 260

      Title: Basic White Bread (Zojirushi)
 Categories: breadmaker, breads
      Yield: 1 loaf

  1 1/2 c  water
      2 tb oil
      3 tb sugar
      1 ts salt
      2 tb powdered milk
  4 3/4 c  bread flour
      3 ts yeast*

*I use 1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons of the yeast from Sam's.

Combine all ingredients in pan.  Set timer for Quick Baking (2 hours)
and light crust. Makes a 2 pound size loaf.

NOTE: This is a basic white bread that you can use as a base for other
flavored breads.  This bread has a nice firm yet light texture. I add
basil or Italian seasoning and/or garlic powder for an Italian
flavored bread that's great with spaghetti. I sometimes substitute
1/4 cup oatmeal for 1/4 cup of flour for the added nutrients.

Note just above the recipe says that this bread was inspired by fond
memories of Linda's Dad sitting at the table pouring milk over his
rice and putting cinnamon & sugar on top. Also notes to watch dough
ball as it varies each time you make it and that if you use freshly
cooked rice you will need to add extra liquid. 1. Place all
ingredients except raisins in bread pan, using the least amount of
liquid listed in the recipe. Select Light Crust setting and
Raisin/Nut cycle. Press start. 2. Observe the dough as it kneads.
After 5 to 10 minutes, if it appears dry & stiff or if your machine
sounds as if it's straining to knead it, add more liquid 1 tbsp. at a
time until dough forms a smooth, soft, pliable ball that is slightly
tacky to the touch. 3.  At the beep, add the raisins. 4. After the
baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan, place on cake rack, & allow
to cool 1 hour before slicing. CRUST: Light -- BAKE CYCLE: Raisin/nut

I finally found it and we are hooked. Thanks to my bread maker; we
have no excuse for not having a great homemade pizza in no time. I
hope you'll try it out and let me know how you like it. By the way,
this doesn't make a Pizza Hut type of pan pizza dough, instead it is
a hand-tossed type that is tender and not tough...delicious! Try it.
Another note: I have a Welbilt 350.

Put all ingredients in your bread maker on manual and let it do the
work. I let it rise for a little longer after it finishes, but judge
for yourself if it requires that. Divide into two 12" pies (I roll it
out) Put on two cornmeal covered pans, prick with a fork, brush with
oil, add toppings and preheat your oven to 500F. Let the pizzas rise
for 15 minutes or so, then bake for 7 minutes. MMMama Mia!! I've
gotten great recipes off this BB, so I thought I'd reciprocate! Hope
you like it!!

      Title: Gluten Free Mock Rye Bread (For Bread Machine)
 Categories: breadmaker, breads
      Yield: 1 loaf

  1 1/2 c  brown rice flour
    1/2 c  rice bran
    1/2 c  tapioca flour
    1/2 c  potato starch flour
      1 tb xanthan (or guar) gum
      1 tb caraway seeds
    1/2 ts salt
    1/2 c  dry milk (non-instant)
      1 tb cocoa powder
      1 ts grated orange peel
      2 ts yeast
      2    eggs
      3 tb oil
      1 tb fruit sweet
      2 tb molasses
  1 1/2 c  water
      2 tb water
      1 ts vinegar

Follow directions for your particular bread machine.  Use single rise
setting.

I wrap the bread in a towel for about 4 hours after it is done baking
and then slice it thinly with an electric knife.  It freezes well.  I
take individual slices of bread out the the freezer and then
microwave about 30 seconds per slice.

This bread is wonderful!  Many of my non-celiac guests request this
over homemade whole wheat bread.

      Title: Gluten Free Bread Hints - Bread Machine
 Categories: breadmaker, hints
      Yield: 1 info sheet

      1    no ingredients

From - Bread Machine Baking for Better Health, Maureen Keane and
Danirlla Chase. ~---- Personal Note: I have not tried any of these
recipes, but for anyone that is on a restricted diet I would
recommend that you take a look at this book. I found it at our local
health food store. ~----

Check your machine's instruction booklet to make sure your machine
can bake whole grain breads.  Some machines on the market today are
equipped to make only lighter, white breads.  If you bake whole grain
breads in this type of machine you will eventually wear down the
motor. Baking Gluten Free Bread in ABM

Since only flours containing no lkiadin and prolamin can be used to
make bread for people with celiac disease or dermatitis
herpetiformis, a substitute for gluten must be used to make the dough
rise. An excellent substitute for gluten is xanthan gum, a natural
product made from Xanthomomas campestis.  This micro organism is
grown in the lab for its cell coat, which is dried and ground to form
xanthan gum. Xantham gum is added as a powder to the dry bread
ingredients. One teaspoon is needed for every cup of gluten free
flour. You can buy this product at your local health food store or
order it from various mail order companies.

Tips for Making Gluten Free Breads

1.  Buy a machine that makes the 1 1/2 pound square type loaf.  This
will enable you to make medium and small size loaves that are easy to
slice for sandwiches and toast.

2.  Gluten free doughs are sticky and difficult to mix.  Help your
machine by checking on the dough often during the first 5 - 10
minutes. Scrape down the sides of the pan with a soft rubber spatula.

3.  Gluten free dough does not look like ordinary wheat dough.
Gluten free doughs require more liquid and in some recipes resemble a
batter more than a dough.  By observing the dough mixing during the
first 5 ~ 10 minutes you will get a feel for what the dough should
look like and be able to adjust the liquid and dry ingredients
accordingly.

4.  The dough will mix more readily if you always add the liquid
ingredients first.  Do this EVEN if your machine recommends that dry
ingredients should go in first.

5.  GF breads require extra yeast to rise.  Some recipes will double
or triple the amount of yeast called for in a similar recipe made
with wheat flour.

6. If your machine has a yeast dispenser, do NOT use it.  The bread
will rise higher if you sprinkle the yeast on top of the dry
ingredients just before you start the machine.

7.  A combination of three or four flours will taste better than a
mixture of just one or two flours.  The bread will rise higher as
well.

8.  Never buy your flours from an open bin.  They may be contaminated
with small amounts of gluten containing products.  Use only products
that are sealed in a package.

9.  Wheat free ingredients are not the same as gluten free products.

10.  Potato starch flour is not the same as potato flour.  Potato
flour is heavier and does not work well in gluten free breads.

Lactose intolerance:

Cereal free soymilk makes an excellent substitute for milk.  Fortified
soymilk will also add significant amounts of protein, calcium,
vitamin D and ribroflavin to your breads:

      Title: Herb Focaccia
 Categories: breadmaker
      Yield: 1 loaves

------------------------SUSAN COSTNER'S GREAT SANDWI------------------------
      1 oz yeast
    1/2 c  water; lukewarm
    1/4 c  oil, olive
    1/4 c  herbs, fresh; finely chopped
           - rosemary,
      1 ts salt
    3/4 c  water; lukewarm
  5 1/4 c  flour

---------------------------------BRUSH WITH---------------------------------
      1 c  oil, olive

----------------------------------GARNISH-----------------------------------
      1 tb coarse salt

In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast in water. Let it proof for
10    minutes.

Add olive oil, flour, herbs, salt, and remaining water to make a soft
dough.  Knead with an electric mixer and dough hook or by hand for 5
minutes, or until smooth and elastic, adding a little more flour to
prevent sticking.

Oil the large mixing bowl without washing it, and turn the dough
several times to coat it.  Cover with a damp clean kitchen towel or
plastic wrap and put in a warm place away from drafts for 1 1/2 to 2
hours or until doubled in bulk.

Punch the dough down and return it to the bowl.  Coat it with olive
oil and let it rise 20-30 minutes or until light.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Flatten the dough by hand onto a
13 X 18" oiled baking sheet. Sprinkle with the coarse salt. Bake for
20 minutes or until golden brown.  Brush the focaccia with oil after
baking. When the bread has cooled, cut into 4-inch squares for
sandwiches.

Sylvia's comments: I mixed up everything except the "brush with" oil
in the breadmachine.  That 5-1/4 c flour is fiction, it barely took
3-1/2 cups. I wasn't sure about the 1 oz yeast but figured it might
be a tablespoon, which I used.  Then I split the one big loaf into
two pie-pan loaves. Maybe this was designed as a sandwich bread, it
sure didn't impress me as a true flavorful focaccia.  Even the salt
and herbs didn't give it much flavor. I doubt I'll make it again.

      Title: Focaccia (Italian Flatbread) Abm
 Categories: breadmaker, italian
      Yield: 6 servings

  2 1/2 c  flour, bread
      1 tb rosemary leaves
      2 ts salt
    1/2 tb yeast
      3 tb olive oil
      1 c  water; hot
      1    olive oil

Bring all ingredients to room temperature and add to breadmaker, in
order. Select "white bread, manual" and press Start.  Remove dough
when cycle complete.

By hand directions: Mix 1 1/2 cups of the flour, the rosemary, salt,
and yeast in a large bowl thoroughly. Add 3 tablespoons oil and the
hot water. Beat on low speed 30 seconds, scraping bowl constantly.
Beat on medium speed 1 minute, scraping bowl frequently.  Stir in
enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle. Turn dough onto
lightly floured surface. Knead 5 to 8 minutes or until smooth and
elastic. Place in greased bowl; turn greased side up. Cover and let
rise in warm place about 1 hour or until double.  (Dough is ready if
indentation remains when touched.) Punch down dough.

Brush 12" pizza pan or large cookie sheet with oil. Press dough in
pizza pan or flatten into 12" circle on cookie sheet. Make
depressions with fingers, about 2" apart, into dough.  Brush with
oil; sprinkle with pepper. Let rise uncovered in warm place 30
minutes.

Heat oven to 400 degrees.  Bake 20-25 minutes, until golden brown.
Brush with additional oil.  Serve warm.

High altitude directions (3500 to 6500 feet): Rising times may be
slightly shorter.

Sylvia's comments: I suppose if you like risen flatbreads, this one is
fine.  It rose well, had a nice aroma, developed a nice golden crust.
Just didn't do anything exciting for me.  I couldn't even see a point
in letting the bread rise and bake in the breadmaker, since I have
plenty of other herb bread recipes.

 Categories: breadmaker, breads, vegetables
      Yield: 1 loaf

    1/4 c  water
      4 tb oil
      1    egg white
      1 ts lemon juice
    2/3 c  cheddar cheese, grated
      3 tb green onion
    1/2 c  broccoli, chopped
    1/2 c  cauliflower, chopped
    1/2 ts lemon-pepper seasoning
      2 c  bread flour
  1 1/2 ts reg. or quick-rising yeast

All ingredients should be at room temperature.  Place in pan in order
suggested by machine's manual.

Because the moisture content of vegetables varies a lot, it is
important to watch the amount of liquid used.  Do not add any extra
liquid until the machine has kneaded long enough to extract liquid
from the vegetables. At first, the dough appears dry, even crumbly,
but it is easy to see the vegetables begin to release their moisture
and the dough ball form. If a soft, round, slightly tacky ball has
not formed near the end of kneading, more liquid can be added one
tablespoon at a time.

 Categories: breadmaker, breads
      Yield: 1 1/2lb loaf

  1 1/2 c  applesauce
  1 1/4 c  all-purpose flour
      1 c  whole wheat flour
    1/2 c  oatmeal*
    1/4 c  wheat germ
    1/4 c  oat bran
      2 ts gluten
      1 ts cinnamon
    1/2 ts ginger [opt'l]
      1 ts salt
  1 1/2 ts yeast

The combination of oatmeal, wheatgerm and applesauce is deadly!

* Grind oatmeal into a coarse flour before adding to the dough pail.

Add the solid and liquid ingredients and the yeast in order according
to the machine's manufacturer.

Be on hand to observe the first mixing cycle and add flour or water as
needed as the moisture content of applesauce varies dramatically from
batch to batch.

Because of the applesauce this bread needs no sugar or butter/oil.

      Title: Fluffy Popcorn Bread
 Categories: breadmaker
      Yield: 10 servings

  1 1/2 c  water
  2 1/2 tb butter
      1 tb sugar
      1 ts salt
      2 tb vital gluten
      1 c  milled popped popcorn
      3 c  bread flour
      2 ts yeast

Pop popcorn. 1/2 cup popcorn yields 8 cups. Mill the popped popcorn.
8 cups of popped popcorn will yield 4 cups of fluffy popcorn flour.
Put ingredients in breadpan in order given. Set for rapid bake. The
resulting loaf is high and light--the texture almost of "Wonder
Bread" but much more flavorful. I milled the popcorn in my electic
Miracle Mill but the hand mills should work fine,too. Popcorn must be
compressed a bit as it's entering the mill and a wooden lemon reamer
works well as a "stuffer". Do NOT attempt to mill unpopped popcorn in
your electric mill. I can only break those hard kernels with my Back
to Basics hand mill. The extra popcorn flour can be frozen in a
ziploc and stored for future loaves. The fragrance is wonderful!

      Title: Pepper-Sweet Corn Bread
 Categories: breadmaker, breads, vegetables
      Yield: 1 loaf

      2 tb oil
    1/2 c  water
      1    egg
    1/2 c  kernel corn (cooked)
      1 c  red bell pepper,chopped
      1 ts paprika
      1 ts salt
    1/3 c  cornmeal
      2 c  bread flour
  1 1/2 ts reg. or quick rising yeast

All ingredients should be at room temperature.  Place in pan in order
suggested by machine's manual.

Because the moisture content of vegetables varies a lot, it is
important to watch the amount of liquid used.  Keep this rule in
mind; Do not add any extra liquid until the machine has kneaded long
enough to extract liquid from the vegetables.  At first, the dough
appears dry, even crumbly, but it is easy to see the vegetables begin
to release their moisture and the dough ball form.  If a soft, round,
slightly tacky ball has not formed near the end of kneading, more
liquid can be added one tablespoon at a time.

 Categories: breadmaker, breads, corn
      Yield: 1 1/2lb loaf

      9 oz water
      1 tb veg oil
    1/4 c  wheat germ
    1/4 c  oat bran
      1 c  cream of wheat cereal

  1 1/2 ts yeast
    1/4 c  dried parsley [opt'l]

Add the liquid and solid ingredients and the yeast in order according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Run on regular/basic and medium
crust.

The cream of wheat is not as gritty as cornmeal and yet the corn flour
provides the corn taste.

I made my first loaf with parsley but as for any cornmeal bread or
muffin, the addition of garlic, chiles, bacon bits and/or cheese
should work.

      Title: SOURDOUGH STARTER (1 OF 2)
 Categories: breadmaker, breads
      Yield: 2 servings

      1    no ingredients

A true sourdough starter is nothing more than the flour and milk or
water which sits at room temperature for several days and catches
live yeast bacteria from the air. Most starter recipes today include
yeast as an original ingredient as it is much easier and less time
consuming. In addition, many sourdough bread recipes also indicate
usage of yeast itself as it does provide a higher rising, lighter
loaf. A sourdough starter should be kept in a glass or plastic bowl
which has a tight fitting lid. I recommend a bowl instead of a jar as
you can "feed" your starter right in the bowl easily. To make your
starter, mix together: INGREDIENTS: 2 cup lukewarm milk, 2 cup bread
flour and 2 1/2 tsp yeast (one package)

Mix the starter with an electric or hand held mixer on the lowest
setting. Cover your starter and place in a warm, draft-free location
for 4 to 7 days, gently stirring it once a day. You may notice that
the mixture bubbles and in some cases it may even overflow the bowl.
This is an indication that you have a healthy starter which should
simply be poured off and discarded. If your starter ever changes
colors, to purple, for example, discard and start another one.
After allowing your starter to sit for 4 to 7 days it is ready to be
used. Take out whatever portion your recipe calls for and put into the
machine as you would any liquid ingredient. After removing a portion
from the starter, the starter must be "fed". Simply add equal
portions of milk or water and flour as was used. For example, if you
used 1 cup of starter, replace it with 1 cup of water and 1 cup of
bread flour. Some hints on feeding your starter: always use the same
kind of flour. If you used bread flour in your original starter, use
bread flour to feed it. Also, alternate between milk and water for
each feeding. Since your original liquid ingredient was milk, the
first liquid feeding should be with water. If you forget which you
used last, that's okay, but try to alternate at least every other
time. After feeding your starter, let it sit at room temperature for
about one day and then refrigerate. =Continued= ... You know your in
YK if: you set a cake out to cool & in 5 minutes it's frosted.

      Title: SOURDOUGH STARTER (2 OF 2)
 Categories: breadmaker, breads
      Yield: 2 servings

      1    no ingredients

=Continued=
Many cookbooks suggest stirring the starter once a day even when
being refrigerated; I find that it is not necessary. You must,
however, use a portion of the starter at least once a week. If you
choose not to bake sourdough breads that often, then remove a cup of
your starter and feed it as though you used some during the week. If
this is not done, your starter will turn rancid and have to be
replaced. Should you be away on vacation or otherwise not able to
tend to the starter, freeze it. Upon your return, thaw it in the
refrigerator and then remove a portion and feed it as soon as you are
able.
You may be thinking that this sounds too complicated, but it really
is not, nor is the starter overly fragile. A friend of mine had the
same starter for 14 years!
My first few loaves of sourdough were not very sour and I feared it
was my starter. After allowing the starter to mellow a little by
sitting in the refrigerator and using only once a week, it and the
breads became more sour.
Another hint is to put the bread in on the timer cycle for early
morning baking. The milk put in the night before adds a little more
sour taste. If the bread is getting too sour for you, feed with water
more often than milk. Source: The Bread Machine Cookbook by Donna

If you're in the pioneering spirit, here's a sourdough for you.  Yes,
sourdough IS possible in a bread machine - for bakers with the time,
patience and adventuresome spirit to see this most-independent bread
to completion.  Because every starter is different, sourdough baking
is always a challenge.  In bread machines, it becomes its own art
form! Experiment - it's the hallmark of a sourdough baker!

      2 ts yeast
      3 ts butter

It takes 2 1/4 cups corn flakes whirled in the blender to make 1 cup

Rice Krispies, corn flakes or puffed wheat for a portion of the flour.

Add the wet ingredients, flours and other dry ingredients in the order
suggested by the ABM manufacturer and add three dots of butter.

elect
to use a medium-sized banana and not measure it precisely, take
care to watch the dough. Add flour or water as necessary, one

      Title: Soft Whole Wheat Skillet Breads (Chapatti)
 Categories: breadmaker, breads
      Yield: 8 chapattis

------------------------FLATBREADS & FLAVORS; ALFORD------------------------
      2 c  flour, atta; or whole wheat
      1 ts salt
      1 c  water; warm, or as needed

Mix flour and salt in medium bowl.  Make well in center and add
water. Mix with hand or spoon until you can gather it together into a
dough; add more flour or water if needed to make kneadable dough.
Turn out onto lightly floured bread board and knead 8-10 minutes.
Cover with plastic wrap and let stand 1/2-2 hours.

Divide dough into 1 piece per chapatti and flatten each with lightly
floured fingers.  Then roll each piece out to 8" round.  Roll out each
bread without flipping it over; lightly flour bread board as
necessary to keep bread from sticking.  Cover finished breads with
plastic wrap as you roll out the rest.  Don't stack rolled-out
breads; if you don't have enough counter space, roll out just a few
at a time and begin cooking, then roll out the rest as the breads
cook.

Heat tava or cast-iron griddle or skillet over medium-high heat.  When
griddle is hot, place a chapatti on the griddle, top side down.  Cook
10 seconds, then gently flip over.  Cook on second side until small
bubbles begin to form, approxinately 1 minute.  Turn chapatti back to
first side and cook 1 minute longer; at this stage, a perfectly made
chapatti should start to balloon.  This process can be helped along
by gently pressing on the bread.  (We find the easiest method is to
use a small cotton cloth or paper towel, wadded up, to protect your
fingertips from the hot bread.) Gently press down on a large bubble
in the bread, forcing the bubble to expand.  If bread starts to burn
on the bottom before it has ballooned, move chapatti with cloth or
paper towel in griddle, dislodging it from the point at which it is
beginning to burn. Remove finished chapatti from griddle and wrap in
clean towel to keep warm and soft. Cook remaining breads, stacking on
top of one another.

Authors' comments: Making chapattis can be very relaxing.  In quite a
short time, you can produce 8 or 10 breads, each one turning out a
little bit different from the others, but all of them attractive,
nutritious, and good.  We've grown so accustomed to making chapattis
that they now feel almost like a convenience food.  A household
staple of the best kind. Chapattis are traditionally baked on a
cast-iron plate called a tava. If you have a tava, use it. Otherwise,
use a cast-iron griddle or skillet. Chapatti-making can be an
ongoing, everchanging process. Each griddle is different.  Flours are
different. What works well one day doesn't seem to work as perfectly
the next. But whatever happens, your chapattis, ballooned or not,
will be good to eat and satisfying and quick to make.

Sylvia's comments: this worked exactly as described!  As always, I
had the breadmaker mix up the dough and let it rest in there until I
was ready to roll them out.  The bubbles formed as advertised, they
cooked fine and puffed up in my cast-iron pan, and my daughter's face
lit up as she said "These don't taste like nothing, they taste
GREAT!" They are very forgiving to cook, a few times I forgot to flip
them after 10 seconds but they cooked perfectly anyway. The only
substitution I made was to use regular all-purpose flour instead of
atta flour, which I don't like the taste of. The only change I'll
make next time is to double the recipe, the four of us ran out of
chapattis before we ran out of hunger!

Glen Jamieson's comments on FIDO Cooking echo: We found that the
underpowered halogen stove was quite incapable of heating a heavy
frying pan anywhere near hot enough to cook them.  The final solution
was to cook the chapattis directly on the glass surface over the
stove element. Although not as controllable as we would have liked,
with the thermostat switching it on and off, it produced quite
reasonable results. Chapattis can be reheated successfully in a
microwave, and, if thick enough to be split like pita, can be filled
with all sorts of dal or other sauces for a delicious breakfast.

more than the Cakebread with Jiffy.  I simply stored the leftover mix
for my next loaf.
