40-Mile Stew -- A Recipe With A History.

main dish, meats, wild game

1/3 pound beef per person
1/3 cup onion per person
1/2 cup mushrooms, fresh sliced
1  potatoe per person
1  ground sage
1  tomato per person
1  green pepper per person
1/4 pound sausage paties, highly seasoned
1/4 pound cheese, sharp

History: It has become a traditional Dutch oven meal on guided float
trips, particularly on Idaho's Salmon River. The name came from a
old-time river runner who said he made this stew when he "was 40
miles down the river."

Begin by mixing stew beef or cut-up round steak with onion. Season
with garlic salt, pepper, and Worcestershire. Add mushrooms, and
brown in a moderate amount of oil in a heavy Dutch oven over a fairly
hot fire. Stir regularly, until the juices simmer away and the meat
browns.

Remove the Dutch oven to low heat. With a spatula scrape loose
anything sticking to the bottom. This is the last time it is stirred.

Level the meat in a layer in the bottom of the Dutch oven. Add an even
layer of potatoes sliced 1/3-inch thick. Sprinkle with ground sage,
more than you think you should use. Add a layer of sliced fresh
tomatoes, enough to cover the potatoes. Add a layer of bell pepper
pieces to cover the tomatoes. Some people make the mistake of adding
carrots at this time, spoiling all the work they have done.

Put a layer of thin, highly seasoned sausage paties over the peppers.
Put the Dutch oven over low, even heat and simmer. Since it si not
stirred, too much heat will scorch the bottom. A great deal of juice
will cook out of the vegetables. This should be simmered away,
leaving the stew a thick casserole consistency.

If time is short, the stew is edible when the sausage is done. You can
brown the sausge by heating the Dutch oven lid in the fire and piling
coals on it when you replace it on the oven, but that isn't
essential. Add a layer of cheese over the sausage when the stew
begins to thicken and let it melt in, about long enough for a beer. A
sharp Cheddar is traditional, but a smoked Danish cheese is
recommended. Serve with a green salad, biscuits, and a beverage.

Because a "40-miler" is in layers, a serving should go all the way to
the bottom of the Dutch oven.

A Grete Pye

main dish, meats, medieval

1 pound shortcrust pastry
1 egg white, beaten
1 until liquid
1 pound boned breasts of chicken
1 pigeon or wild duck and/or
1 saddle of hare or rabbit
1 (not stewing meat)
1 salt and black pepper
1 pound minced beef
2 tablespoon shredded suet
3 hard-boiled egg
1 yolks crumbled
1/4 teaspoon each ground
1 cinnamon and mace
1 and a pinch of ground cloves
1 ounce stoned cooking dates chopped
1 ounce currants
2 ounce stoned prunes soaked
1 and drained
1/2 cup beef stock
1 tablespoon rice flour or cornflour

No Christmas feast in medieval times was complete without a 'grete
pye'. In some recipes, it could contain many varied meats, but quite
often only two or three different kinds were suggested; change the
meats suggested here if you wish. Use just over half the pastry to
line a 23-cm/9-inch pie plate. Brush the inside with some of the egg
white. Skin the pieces of breast and other meat if necessary and
parboil them gently in salted water for 10-15 minutes.  Drain and
leave to cool. Mix together in a bowl the minced beef, suet, salt and
pepper to taste, the egg yolks and half the spice mixture. Add the
rest of the spices to the dried fruit in another bowl. Slice the
parboiled meat. Pre-heat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas Mark 7. Add 1 or 2
tablespoons of the beef stock to the rice flour or cornflour in a
small saucepan and cream them together; then add the remaining stock
and stir over gentle heat until slightly thickened. Keep aside. Cover
the bottom of the pastry case with half the mince mixture. Arrange
the sliced meat in a flat layer on top. Scatter the chopped spiced
fruit over it and cover with the remaining mince.  Pour the thickened
stock over the lot. Roll out the remaining pastry into a round to
make a lid for the pie. Brush the rim of the case with a little more
egg white and cover with the lid. Press the edges to seal, and make
escape slits for steam. Decorate with the pastry trimmings and glaze
with egg white. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to
160C/325F/Gas Mark 3 and bake for 45-50 minutes longer. Serves 6 to
8. Grete pyes. Take faire yonge beef, And suet of a fatte beste, or

Andouille

meats, makemeat

1 1/2  yards large sausage casing,
1  approximately  (about 2-3
1  inches wide)
4 pound lean fresh pork
2 pound pork fat
3 1/3 tablespoon finely minced garlic
2 tablespoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black
1  pepper
1/8 teaspoon cayenne
1/8 teaspoon chili powder
1/8 teaspoon mace
1/8 teaspoon allspice
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 tablespoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon ground bay leaf
1/4 teaspoon sage
5 teaspoon colgin's liquid hickory
1  smoke

Andouille was a great favorite in nineteenth-century New Orleans. This
thick Cajun sausage is made with lean pork and pork fat and lots of garlic.
Sliced about 1/2 inch thick and grilled, it makes a delightful appetizer.
It is  also used in a superb oyster and andouille gumbo popular in Laplace,
a Cajun  town about 30 miles from New Orleans that calls itself the
Andouille   Capital of the World.

(about 6 pounds of 20 inch sausage, 3 to 3 1/2 inches thick)

Soak the casing about an hour in cold water to soften it and to loosen the
salt in which it is packed.  Cut into 3 yard lengths, then place the narrow
end of the sausage stuffer in one end of the casing. Place the wide end of
the stuffer up against the sink faucet and run cold water through the
inside of the casing to remove any salt. (Roll up the casing you do not
intend to use; put about 2 inches of coarse salt in a large jar, place the
rolled up casing on it, then fill the rest of the jar with salt. Close
tightly and refrigerate for later use.)

Cut the meat and fat into chunks about 1/2 inch across and pass once
through the coarse blade of the meat grinder.  Combine the pork with the
remaining ingredients in a large bowl and mix well with a wooden spoon. Cut
the casings into 26 inch lengths and stuff as follows: Tie a knot in each
piece of casing about 2 inches from one end.  Fit the open end over the tip
of the sausage stuffer and slide it to about 1 inch from the wide end. Push
the rest of the casing onto the stuffer until the top touches the knot.
(The casing will look like accordion folds on the stuffer.) Fit the stuffer
onto the meat grinder as directed on the instructions that come with the
machine, or hold the wide end of the stuffer against or over the opening by
hand. Fill the hopper with stuffing. Turn the machine on if it is electric
and feed the stuffing gradually into the hopper; for a manual machine, push
the stuffing through with a wooden pestle.  The sausage casing will fill
and inflate gradually.  Stop filling about 1 1/4 inches from the funnel end
and slip the casing off the funnel, smoothing out any bumps carefully with
your fingers and being careful not to push the stuffing out of the casing.
Tie off the open end of the sausage tightly with a piece of string or make
a knot in the casing itself. Repeat until all the stuffing is used up.

To cook, slice the andouille 1/2 inch thick and grill in a hot skillet with
no water for about 12 minutes on each side, until brown and crisp at the
edges.

2 tablespoon butter
1 pound canadian bacon
2 large red tart cooking apples; unpeeled, cored & cut in
2 large onions; thinly sliced

Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a heavy skillet. When foam subsides
add the bacon. Fry 5 to 10 minutes or until the bacon is lightly
browned. Remove from skillet and set on paper towels to drain. Fry
the onion slices for 6 to 8 minutes in the fat remaining in the
skillet, adding more butter as necessary. When the onions are soft
and transparent, add the apple rings and cover the pan. Simmer over
low heat for 5 to 10 minutes, shaking the pan gently at intervals to
prevent the apples from sticking. When the apple rings are
sufficiently cooked (they should offer little or no resistence when
pierced with the tip of a sharp knife or skewer), return the drained
bacon to the skillet. Cover and simmer an additional 3 to 5 minutes
or until the bacon is heated through. Grind fresh black pepper
liberally over the top and serve directly from the pan as a luncheon

Apple Beef Brisket

meats, beef

1 beef brisket (4 to 5 pound); trimmed of fat
1 large yellow onion; peeled and quartered
2 large cloves garlic; chopped
10 cloves garlic; whole
10 ounce jar apple jelly
1/2 cup dry white wine
3 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 large green onions; chopped about 1/4 cup
1/2 teaspoon ; salt
3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
3/4 teaspoon curry powder
1 cup apple juice
1/4 cup parsley; chopped, for garnish

Place brisket, the yellow onion, chopped garlic and garlic cloves in a
large Dutch oven.  Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce
heat, cover and simmer 2 1/2 hours or until the brisket is tender.
Drain brisket. (If you wish, you could keep the brisket covered with
the cooking liquid and refrigerate it overnight. This will help
prepare for the next day.) In a small saucepan, mix together the
apple jelly, wine, mustard, green onions, salt, pepper, and curry
powder. Heat until the jelly melts.

Place brisket in a shallow roasting pan and brush some of the jelly
mixture over the top.  Bake at 325 degrees F. for 45 minutes, basting
3 or 4 times with the remaining jelly mixture. Remove the meat to a
platter to keep warm.  Place the pan over 2 burners and add apple
juice, stirring to scrape up browned bits on bottom of pan. Bring to
a boil over medium-high heat. Boil, stirring, until slightly
thickened and reduced by about half. Pour into a gravy boat. Slice
meat and garnish with the parsley. Serve with gravy.  Makes 8 servings

2 tablespoon margarine or butter; melted
1 pound lean ground beef
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 cup raisins
4 tablespoon brown sugar; packed

Arnaki Se Fillo (Lamb In Fillo)

meats, lamb, greek

1 karen mintzias
6 boneless lamb leg steaks *
1 freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoon butter or oil
2 medium onions; sliced
1 garlic clove
12 fillo sheets
1/2 cup butter; melted
1  salt
3 medium tomatoes; peeled
1 teaspoon rigani or oregano
125 gm feta cheese; cut in 6 slices

*Note: Lamb steaks should be about 2 cm (3/4 inch) thick.

Serves: 6 Oven temperature: 200 C (400 F) Cooking time: 25-30 minutes

Trim steaks of most of the fat and shape neatly - trimmings can be
used in a ground lamb dish.  Season with pepper.

Heat butter or oil in a frying pan and brown steaks quickly on each
side - do not cook through.  Lift out onto a dish and leave until
cool. Add onions to pan and fry gently until transparent, add garlic
and remove from heat.

Brush a sheet of fillo pastry with melted butter and place another
sheet on top, brushing again with butter. Fold in half to make almost
a square of fillo.  Put aside and cover wtih a dry tea towel, then
one dampened with warm water.  Repeat with remaining fillo to give 6
prepared squares. Take one square and brush top with butter - leave
remaining pastry covered. Place a lamb steak in the centre and season
lightly with salt. Top with onion-garlic mixture and cover with 2
slices of tomato. Sprinkle with a little rigani, salt and pepper and
place a slice of feta cheese on top. Bring up ends of fillo pastry
and double-fold over top. Fold in ends as you would a package then
tuck ends underneath. This is known as a the chemist's (druggist's)
fold.  Place on a buttered baking tray. Repeat with remaining
ingredients.

Brush tops and sides of packages lightly with melted butter and bake
in a preheated hot oven for 15 minutes. Serve immediately if
possible, though they will survive in the oven with heat turned off
for about 10 minutes. Garnish with parsley sprigs and serve with
boiled green beans or zucchini dressed with olive and lemon juice.

Note:  Medallions of lamb cut from a trimmed loin can be used instead
of the steaks.  You will require 12, and place 2 in each package.

ARNI EXOHIKO ("SURPRISE" LAMB~ COUNTRY STYLE

meats, lamb, greek

1 karen mintzias
2 tablespoon olive oil
8 loin lamb chops
18 sheets commercial phyllo
6 tablespoon butter; hot and melted
2 cup peas; cooked and drained
16 potato balls; parboiled
16 cherry tomatoes; peeled
1/2 pound kasseri cheese; in 8 pieces
1 salt and freshly ground pepper
3/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1 pinch dried oregano

*Note: 3/4-inch slices leg of lamb may be used instead of lamb chops.

In a heavy skillet, heat the oil or butter and fry the lamb over high
heat, turning frequently.  Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes,
then remove from the heat. Meanwhile, unroll the filo sheets and
cover with a damp towel.  In a small pan over low heat, have the
butter hot without letting it brown. Remove two sheets of filo, brush
with hot butter over the first, then cover with the second sheet and
brush it with butter. In the center of the buttered filo place 1 lamb
chop, 2 tablspoons peas, 2 potato balls, 2 cherry tomatoes, and a
slice of kasseri. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, a heaping tablespoon
of parsley, and a pinch of oregano. Fold the filo around the lamb and
vegetables like a sealed parcel. Place, seam side down, on a buttered
baking pan (approximately 11 x 15 x 3 inches) and set aside while you
repeat the procedure with the remaining ingredients to make 8
"parcels".  Brush hot butter on the tops, then bake in a moderate
oven (350 F) for 45 to 50 minutes or until golden in color. Remove
from the oven and arrange on a warm platter or on individual dishes.
Serve warm, with a fresh-cooked or raw vegetable salad.

Note: The vegetables and herbs may be varied. Substitute green beans
or lima beans for peas, use thyme or basil instead of oregano. Arni
Exohiko is frequently prepared using buttered waxed paper, parchment
paper or aluminum foil rather than with filo.

Make a gravy - melt a little dripping (solid oil will do). Mix in plain

the meat mix and stir over low heat. Add water until it becomes a nice
gravy mix. (As thick or thin as you like.) Mix this gravy in with the meat.
That is your pie filling.

Authentic Tex-Mex Fajitas

beef

2 pound beef skirt steak
1/2  onion; halved, slice thin
2 teaspoon ground cumin
2 teaspoon powdered red chiles
3  jalapenos; (pickled) chopped
2 cl garlic; chopped
1/4 cup lime juice
2 tablespoon jalapeno pickling liquid; *
1 tablespoon corn oil
1 tablespoon soy sauce; (optional)
1 teaspoon liquid smoke; (optional)

This is the liquid used to pickle and flavor the jalapenos. It is
basically white vinegar with added spices, and there is always ample
liquid in the jar or can to use in this recipe, without leaving the
remaining jalapenos dry.

1. Place half of the onions in the bottom of a nonreactive dish. Mix
the cumin, powdered red chiles, chopped jalapenos and garlic together
in a small bowl, then rub on all sides of the meat. Put the skirt
steak into the dish, on top of the onions. Pour the lime juice and
the jalapeno liquid over all areas to coat. Sprinkle the remaining
onions on top of the meat. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour, but
preferably overnight, turning once.

2. Preheat the grill or broiler until hot. Fajitas need to cook
close to a very high heat source, in order to sear the outside but
still leave the interior medium rare. Mix together the oil and, if
you are using them, the soy sauce and liquid smoke. Brush or spoon
the oil mixture onto the meat surfaces. Grill or broil about 2 to 3
minutes on each side, or until the outside is brown and slightly
charred, and the inside is still slightly pink.

3. Remove the meat to a cutting board. Let sit 5 minutes before
slicing. Cut the meat into thin strips that can be easily rolled into
tortillas. Serve with warm, soft flour tortillas and fresh Pico de
Gallo or Salsa Fresca.

NOTES:

Fajitas are pure Tex-Mex food. They originated along the Rio Grande
River on the Texas-Mexico border and were eaten by cattle wranglers.
The skirt steak is the traditional cut used and was reserved
primarily for the chief cowboy. Other cuts of beef can be
substituted, such as flank steak or sirloin, but the skirt is by far
the most tender, flavorful and authentic.

You might be wondering where the cast-iron griddle with the sizzling
bell peppers and onions are in this recipe. While such a serving
method may be dramatic, it is an affectation developed mainly by
chain restaurants and is in no way a part of true Tex-Mex fajitas.
You may go ahead and add it, but I am still partial to the clean,
simple taste of hot grilled meat topped solely with fresh tomato
salsa and blanketed in warm, soft tortillas. I do make two minor
additions in my recipe when oven-broiling: I add soy sauce to help
the thinly cut steaks brown quicker, and I use bottled "liquid smoke"
to replicate the flavors created by the more desirable method of
charcoal-grilling. Otherwise, this recipe is as authentic as it gets.

Baked Sandwiches

sandwich, low cal

1 1/4 cup water at 110 to 115 f
2 1/4 teaspoon quick-rise yeast (1 pkg)
2 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1  egg
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 cup graham flour
1  filling
1 1/2 pound lean ground beef
1/2 cup chopped onions
1 cup tomato sauce
1/4 cup catsup
1 teaspoon garlic salt
1/2 teaspoon leaf oregano
1 pinch pepper

May be frozen.  Defrost in the fridge, on the way to a picnic or in
the microwave if you want them in a hurry.

Combine water and yeast in mixer bowl and let stand 5 minutes.  Add
all purpose flour and mix at medium speed for another 4 minutes.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead a few
times, form into a ball and place in a well-greased mixing bowl.
Turn the ball over to grease the top, cover with a cloth and let
stand at room temperature to rise until doubled in volume.

While the dough is rising, cook the meat and onions over medium heat,
stirring frequently, until the onions are soft and the meat is
browned. Drain.  Discard fat and juice, return meat and onions to the
pan.  Add tomato sauce, catsup, seasoning and cook over medium heat
until the meat is dry with no noticeable liquid.  Set meat mixture
aside to cool until dough is ready.

After the dough has doubled in volume, transfer it to a lightly
floured working surface.  Knead lightly.  Form into a roll and cut
into 12 equal portions.  Form each portion into a little ball, cover
with a cloth and let rest for 10 minutes.

Roll each ball out to form a circle 5 to 6 inches across.  Put about
1/4 cup of the meat mixture in the center of the circle.  Pull the
dough up around the filling and press together at the top.  Place on
a well greased cookie sheet, cover with a cloth and let stand about
30 to 40 minutes at room temperature or until doubled in volume.
Bake at 350 F for 40 to 45 minutes or until lightly browned and firm.
Serve hot, using 1 sandwich per serving, or refrigerate or freeze to
be used later.

Bea's Unstuffed Cabbage

soups, ground beef

1 onion diced (1 cup)
2 pound head green cabbage,dice
8 ounce tomato sauce
28 ounce can peeled tomatoes and juice
1 cup water
1/2 cup honey
1/4 cup lemon juice
1/3 cup raisins
1 pound ground beef or veal or lamb
1/2 cup raw white rice
1 teaspoon worchestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)
1 ground pepper to taste

NOTE:  This has a long cooking time.  It is a dish that is best
prepared early in the day and reheated at serving time since the
flavor improves. NOTE:  Ms. Brody says that this dish could easily
feed a crowd if you have a pot or pots big enough to double or
guadruple, etc. it.

1.  In a large heavy pot combine all the soup ingredients except the
raisins.  Bring to a boil over medium-high heat while preparing the
meatballs.

2.  Combine meatball ingredients, stirring them to mix thoroughly.
With wet hands, roll the meat mixture in 1 1/4" balls. Add the
meatballs to the boiling cabbage soup, reduce the heat to medium-low,
cover and simmer for 2 hours.

3.  Remove the cover, add the raisins, and cook for another 30
minutes in the uncovered pot.

She suggests that mashed potatoes would be an excellent accompaniment.
Also, that the dish goes well with broad egg noodles.

Beef & Vegetable Kabobs

vegetables, beef

1 pound top round steak; cut into 1.5 inch chunks
1 medium spanish or vidalia onions; quartered and separated
3 tablespoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon dry sherry
1 tablespoon salad or olive oil
1 tablespoon chili sauce
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1 medium zucchini
1 medium straight-neck squash
1 medium red or green pepper
1/2 pound medium mushrooms
1/2 pound cherry tomatoes
3/4 cup Italian dressing

1. In a medium sized bowl, mix the first 7 ingredients. Cover mixture
and refrigerate at least 2 house, stirring occasionally.

2. About 1 hour before serving, prepare the grill for barbecuing.

3. Cut zucchini and yellow squash into 1 inch chunks. Cut pepper into
1 inch pieces. On long skewers, alternately thread zucchini, yellow
squash, peppers, tomatoes and mushrooms. (I usually  use only one
tomato and 1 mushroom  per skewer to keep the weight down.)

On separate skewers, alternately thread beef and onions. Save the
marinade for later.

4. Place vegetable and meat skewers on grill over medium heat. If you
have a 2-level grill, place the meat skewers on the lower level and
the vegetable skewers on the top level.

Cook about 10 minutes, brushing the meat and onions with the reserved
marinade and the vegetables with the Italian dressing. Turn skewers
several times while brushing frequently.( A good way to tell that the
vegetables are done is when the tomatoes start to split.)

This is a great meal  served with curried (or regular) rice and a
fresh fruit salad.

Beef Meatballs

appetizers, beef, chinese

1 pound lean ground beef
1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
1 tablespoon chinese rice wine or
1 dry sherry
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated ginger
1 teaspoon sugar
2 green onions -- chopped
1 egg -- beaten
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon sesame oil
2 garlic cloves -- crushed
1 teaspoon soybean condiment *
2 teaspoon finely grated orange peel
1/4 teaspoon msg -- optional
1 bunch spinach or
1 mustard greens -- for
1  garnish

* Note:  Soybean condiment (mein see) can be found
in Asian and Oriental markets.
Mix all ingredients together with the
exception of      the garnish. You need to whip this dish to make it
smooth, so I suggest a good electric mixer. Otherwise, do it by hand
and beat the blazes out of this stuff.          Roll into small
meatballs about 1 1/4-inches in
diameter. Press some of the greens into a steaming bowl and
top with the meatballs. Steam the meatballs in several dishes,
steaming
each, or all together, for that matter, for about 15 minutes.
It is best to use your bamboo steaming racks for these dishes. This
recipe makes about 20 dim sum. Hint:  To keep meatballs from sticking
to your hands, simply moisten your hands in between each molding of a
meatball. Comments: This is a quicky. Buy good hamburger and do
something special in almost no time at all. I love these meatballs.

Beef Rendang

beef, indonesian

1 kg rump steak
2  onions, chopped
4 garlic cloves, chopped
1 tablespoon fresh ginger, chopped
4 small red chillies, chopped
1/2 cup water
2 teaspoon ground coriander
2 tablespoon tamarind sauce
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
10 curry leaves
1 lemon grass, 10 cm stem
4 cup coconut milk

1. Remove fat and sinew from steak, cut meat into 3 cm cubes, place in
bowl. 2. In food processor, combine onions, garlic, ginger, chillies
and water, blend until smooth. Add the mixture to steak. 3. Add
coriander, tamarind sauce, turmeric, curry leaves and lemon grass,
stir until combined. Stir in coconut milk. Bring to a boil, reduce
heat to medium, simmer, uncovered for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
Reduce heat to very low, simmer for 30 minutes, stirring frequently
until the meat is very tender and liquid has been absorbed. Remove
lemon grass before serving. NOTE: It is necessary to stir the Beef
Rendang often during the last 30 minutes of cooking to prevent
coconut milk from separating and to avoid sticking. This distinctive
and delicious curry is cooked very slowly for a long time, until the
meat is very succulent and all the coconut milk has been absorbed. A
close friend of mine, Winnie Quek, and her husband own a fine
Singaporean Restaurant here in Calgary. While her recipe for Beef
Rendang remains a closely guarded secret, this one comes very close.
Winnie has suggested holding back 2 cups of coconut milk until the
last 30 minutes of cooking, then slowly adding it then, as you
continue to simmer and stir until all the liquid has been absorbed.
Winnie says that this will stop the coconut milk from separating and
tasting "oily". Source: Indonesian Cooking

Beef Tips In Red Wine Sauce

main dish, meats

2 cup cubed beef sirloin, trimmed
1 of all visable fat
2 teaspoon olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, chopped
2 cup sliced mushrooms
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 tablespoon flour
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 cup dry red wine
1 1/2 cup beef broth
3 cup cooked extra-wide egg
1  noodles
2 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

Brown beef cubes in the olive oil in a 12 inch nonstick skillet set
over medium heat. Turn the cubes frequently to ensure even browning
on all sides. Add the onions and cook 2 to 3 minutes longer, or until
the onions are fragrant. Add the mushrooms and garlic and reduce heat
to medium low; cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 to 5 minutes
longer, or until mushrooms are brown.

Combine the flour, thyme leaves, black pepper and nutmeg in a small
dish. Sprinkle the flour mixture evenly over the meat and mushroom
mixture, stirring well. Allow the flour mixture to "toast" in the pan
without burning for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Then, stir in the red
wine and beef broth. Stir until the liquid comes to a boil and
thickens very slightly. Reduce heat to low, cover loosely, and simmer
for 20 minutes. The sauce will continue to thicken as water
evaporates during cooking. If the sauce becomes too thick, add a few
tablespoons of water or beef broth.

While the meat is cooking, cook the noodles according to package
directions. When tender, stir the noodles and parsley into the beef
mixture and heat through.

BEEF WELLINGTON

meats, beef

1 each 10-ounce package frozen
1 patty shells
4 pound beef tenderloin roast
1  salt
1 all-purpose flour
2 cup fresh mushrooms, chopped
2 tablespoon butter
4 ounce can goose liver pate
1 tablespoon cognac
2 teaspoon chives, snipped
1  salt
1 freshly ground pepper
1 each egg yolk
1 tablespoon water

Allow patty shells to thaw 2 hours in refrigerator before rolling
out. If meat is quite long (Lin, control Thyself!!), fold narrow end
under to form a roast about 12 to 13 inches in length. Place on rack
in shallow roasting pan.  Sprinkle lightly with salt and flour. Bake,
uncovered, in 425 F oven until meat thermometer inserted in thickest
portion registers 120 F, about 35 to 40 minutes.  Cool meat
sufficiently to handle, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in skillet, cook
mushrooms in butter until tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Add pate, Cognac and chives. Make a deep slit in center of roast,
cutting from side, to but not through opposite side. Sprinkle pocket
with salt and pepper. Spoon mushroom-pate mixture into pocket.  On
lightly floured surface, arrange patty shells in a rectangle,
overlapping edges slightly; press edges to seal. (If necessary,
moisten edges with a little water.) Roll out to a 16x11-inch
rectangle. Place roast in a greased 15x10x1-inch baking pan. Lay
pastry over roast, tucking under securely.  Brush pastry with mixture
of egg yolk and water. Bake in 425 F oven for 20 minutes more, or
until pastry is golden. Makes 8 servings.

BEEF/RICE CASSEROLE

main dish, beef

1/2 pound ground beef
1 cup chopped onion
1 pkg chopped broccoli 10 ounce.
1 can broc/cheese soup
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon garlic fresh
3/4 teaspoon rice
1 1/2 cup water

Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. Prepare the rice with the water in
standard manner. (I do not use salt or margarine in the preparation
of the rice.) While the rice is cooking chop the onions and garlic.
Saute slowly until onions are just tender.  Add the ground beef and
brown. Cook onions and ground beef about 7 minutes. Drain off the
fat. Return to medium heat. Separately mix the broccoli cheese soup
and milk. Stir until creamy in texture. At this point test for taste.
I usually add table grind black pepper and salt (less that 1/2
teaspoon). When the ground beef is ready, add the rice and broccoli,
and soup mixture, tossing carefully. Put the mixture in to a 9 x 9,
or 9 x 13 casserole dish. Sometimes I top this with seasoned bread
crumbs and Parmesan cheese. Bake about 35 minutes.

Blaine's Venison Sausage

meats

6 pound ground venison
6 pound ground pork (lean)
2 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoon pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon sage
1/2 cup honey

When the venison, pork and hot water are well mixed, add spices and
honey to mixture and mix in well.

This is probably my favorite recipe eventhough this is the one which
has evolved the most in the past 5 years. A couple of years ago my
father mistakenly calculated the spices in tablespoons instead of
teaspoons, and it was better then the previous batch of sausage
written above. The next year we increased the amount of black pepper,
and was it ever good. So if you like spices, and in sausage a little
spice is good, then play around with the mixture a little bit. I will
be adding a small amount of a "cajun" pepper mix to a small 20 pound.
test batch of sausage this weekend.

Blanquette Of Veal & Cauliflower

main dish, meats

3 pound boneless veal stew meat
1 medium onion, cut in half
2 celery stalks; cut in half
1 medium carrot; cut in half
6 cup low-sodium chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon salt; or as desired
1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2  lemon
5 tablespoon unsalted butter
5 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2 1/2 cup cauliflower florets
3/4 cup sour cream

COMBINE THE VEAL AND 4 CUPS broth in a 5-quart heavy pot over high
heat on top of the stove. Cover and bring to a boil. Remove any scum
that comes to the top of the pot, then add the remaining 2 cups
broth, the onion, celery, carrot, salt, pepper, nutmeg and lemon.
Reduce heat to low and let simmer for 1 1/4 hours, or until meat is
just tender. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a medium pot over low
heat, and whisk in the flour. Cook, stirring, 2 minutes and remove
from heat. Set aside until the meat is cooked. When the meat is done,
remove it from the liquid, using a slotted spoon. Pick off and
discard any vegetables that cling to the veal. Replace the
butter-flour mixture over medium-low heat on the stove and strain the
cooking liquid into it, whisking vigorously. Discard vegetables in
the strainer. Cook, stirring, until mixture thickens, about 3 to 5
minutes. Add cauliflower and continue to cook an additional 15
minutes. Skim off any residue that rises to the surface. When it's
time to serve dinner, add the veal to the cauliflower and sauce and
heat through. Place sour cream in a mixing bowl, whisk in 1/2 cup of
the hot sauce, then add this to the stew. Do not reheat the sauce
after adding sour cream. Pour the stew into a serving dish and
accompany with rice pilaf or buttered noodles.

Bobotie (Lamb Meatloaf)

meats

2 slice white bread
1  milk
2  onions, thinly sliced
1  apple, peeled and diced
2 tablespoon butter
1 pound ground lamb
2 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon cider vinegar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 cup raisins
2  eggs
12 blanched almonds, coarsely chopped
6 kaffir lime leaves
1 cup milk
1 teaspoon turmeric
1 cooked white rice (opt)
1 chutney (opt) 

This curry-flavored meatloaf recipe made the rounds years ago, when
kaffir lime leaves were unknown here. Most people used bay leaves
instead, or even lemon oro range leaves from a backyard tree.
However, it takes the kaffir leaves to add the proper touch of
delicate, lemony perfume.

Soak bread in bowl with milk to cover until soft, then squeeze dry.
Saute onions and apple in skillet with butter until tender and not
browned. Add bread, lamb, curry powder, sugar, vinegar, salt, pepper
and raisins. Add one beaten egg and almonds and mix thoroughly.

Pack mixture lightly into 9x5" baking dish. Arrange lime leaves on
top. Bake at 350'F. 1 hour. Beat remaining egg with milk. Stir in
turmeric. Pour over meatloaf and bake 15 minutes longer. Serve with
rice and chutney.

Boudin Blanc (Ellen Cleary 1)

meats, cajun

3  three foot long lengths hog
1  sausage casing
3 pound boneless lean pork, trimmed
1  excess fat and cut into
1 1/2  inch chunks
4 cup coarsely chopped onions
1  mdm bay leaf, crumbled
6  whole black peppercorns
5 teaspoon salt
1 cup coarsely chopped green
1  pepper
1 cup coarsely chopped parsley
1/2 cup coarsely chopped green
1  onions
1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic
2  12 c freshly cooked white
1  rice
1 tablespoon dried sage leaves
2 1/2 teaspoon cayenne
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Place the sausage casing in a bowl.  Pour in enough warm water to cover it
and soak for 2 - 3 hours, until it is soft and pliable.

Meanwhile, put the pork in a heavy 4-5 quart casserole and add enough water
to cover it by 1 inch.  Bring to a boil over high heat and skim off the
foam and scum that rise to the surface. Add 2 c of onion, the bayleaf,
peppercorns and 1 teaspoon salt. Reduce heat to low and simmer, partially
covered, for 1 1/2 hours.

With a slotted spoon, transfer the chunks of pork to a plate. Put the pork,
the remaining 2 c of onions, the green pepper, parsley, green onions and
garlic through the medium blade of a food grinder and place the mixture in
a deep bowl.  Add the rice, sage, cayenne and black pepper and the
remaining 4 teaspoon of salt. Knead vigorously with both hands, then beat
with a
wooden spoon until the mixture is smooth and fluffy. Taste for seasoning.

To make each sausage, tie a knot 3 inches from one end of a length of the
casing.  Fit the open end over the funnel (or "horn") on the sausage making
attachment of a meat grinder.  Then ease the rest of the casing onto the
funnel, squeezing it up like the folds of an accordion.

Spoon the meat mixture into the mouth of the grinder and, with a wooden
pestle, push it through into the casing.  As you fill it, the casing will
inflate and gradually ease away from the funnel in a ropelike coil. Fill
the casing to within an inch or so of the funnel end but do not try to
stuff it too tightly, or it may burst. Slip the casing off the funnel and
knot the open end.  You may cook the sausages immediately or refrigerate
them safely for five or six days.

Before cooking a sausage, prick the casing in five or six places with a
skewer or the point of a small sharp knife.  Melt 2 Tbsp of butter with 1
Tbsp of oil in a heavy 12 inch skillet set over moderate heat. When the
foam begins to subside, place the sausage in the skillet, coiling it in
concentric circles. Turning the sausage with tongs, cook uncovered for
about 10 minutes, or until it is brown on both sides.

Boudin is the French term for the blood sausage, or "pudding," made with
the blood of the pig.  Boudin blanc is a white sausage made with pork but
no blood.  This Louisiana version adds rice and is even whiter.

Bourek (Beef-Stuffed Pastry Rolls)

hamburger

1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 small onion; chopped (1/4 cup)
1/2 pound ground beef
1/2 teaspoon salt; or to taste
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1  egg; beaten
2 tablespoon flat leaf parsley; chopped
6 phyllo sheets; 12x17 ea
1 lemon wedges for serving

When the fast of Ramadhan is broken in the early evening hours,
various dishes are considered a traditional part of the meal. This is
one of those dishes.

1. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a skillet, add the onion and
stir-fry over moderate heat for 2 minutes. Add the beef, salt and
pepper and stir-fry for 5 minutes. Add the egg and parsley and fry
for 1 minute more. Cool well.

2. Take 1 phyllo sheet and spread it out flat with a short end
nearest you. Place 2 heaping tablespoons of the beef mixture 2 inches
in from the short edge. Fold both long sides in toward the middle,
beginning with the short end roll the phyllo to shape a packet 4
inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide. Repeat with all the remaining
phyllo sheets and stuffing. Set aside.

3. Put the balance of the oil in a skillet over moderate/low heat and
add the rolls. Brown on both sides for about 3 minutes; the low heat
prevents the very thin pastry sheets from burning. Drain the rolls on
paper towels for a minute.

Serve warm with a squeeze of lemon juice. Makes 6.

oven-proof frying pan over medium heat on the stove and add the
sweetbreads. Cook until they are dark golden on both sides, about 5
minutes per side. Do not crowd the pan or they won't brown. Tilt the

Brown 'n' Serve Sausage

meats, diabetic

1 pound lean ground pork
1/4 cup cracker crumbs
1/4 cup water
1 teaspoon sage
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 pinch ground cloves

The two step cooking procedure ensures the removal of most of the fat.

Combine ground pork and cracker crumbs.  Stir in water, sage, salt, thyme,
oregano, pepper and cloves.  Mix until thoroughly combined.

Divide into 12 portions.  Form each into a sausage-shaped roll or flat
patty.  (Wet hands with cold water to make the job easy.)  Place in a cold,
lightly oiled frypan.

Cook over medium heat, turning often, about 4 min each side until just
beginning to brown and pieces are no longer pink.

Remove to paper towels and blot to absorb any fat.  Wrap.  Store in
refrigerator up to 5 days or in freezer up to 2 months.  Or cook a second
time and serve immediately.

To serve:  Return sausages or patties to a clean, cold frypan.  Cook over
medium heat, turning once or twice, about 4 min until sausages are brown
and crisp.  (Cook frozen sausages in the same manner, allowing about 2 min
longer for cooking.

Each sausage or patty - 59 calories, 1 protein choice 1 g carbohydrate, 7 g
protein, 3 g fat.

Suggestion for Pork Pies: Stir-cook the ground pork mixture in the frying
pan, place it in a plastic colander to drain off most of the fat and blot
with paper towels.  Spread the pork mixture in a baking dish (try 8"
pyrex), add fat-free gravy if needed for liquid. Top with about 2 1/4 cups
seasoned breadcrumbs.  Bake at 350-375 F until crumbs are lightly browned.

Cabbage Rolls (Polish Style)

main dish, polish

2 pound ground beef; lean
1/2 cup rice; uncooked
1 medium onion; diced
1  green pepper; diced
2  eggs
1  cabbage; large head
2 quart tomato juice

PREPARE THE CABBAGE LEAVES: The Old timers would freeze the head
solid, then peel the leaves from the head as they thawed. The best
way I've found is to 1)cut the core out with a knife, then put the
hole-where-the-core- was, side down in a steamer over boiling water.
Let it sit for about 10 minutes and remove. Several layers of the
outer leaves should be soft enough to remove from the head. When
you've removed as many as you can, return the head to the steamer to
soften more leaves. Take a sharm knife and remove as much of the
central vein as you can. FILLING: Mix all the other ingredients
together in a bowl. work it with your hands until the eggs and other
inredients except the tomato juice are thouroughly mixed into the
meat. Now, take a glob of mixture and set it in the hollow of a
deveined leaf,with the end that was near the core towards you. Fold
the end nearest you about / way over the mix. Fold the left side over
the mix and then the right side. Roll about / turn away from you so
that the "seam" is on the bottom. Place in the pan seam side don and
continue with the other leaves.* When you've made the last cabbage
roll,pour in the tomato juice to cover. Bring to a boil then simmer
for AT LEAST an hour. Serve in a bowl with the juice, although these,
like spagetti are better the 2nd day.

*This is an ideal cabbage roll. 3/4 of them won't go together this
perfectly, so be ready to make adjustments when making the rolls.

VARIATIONS: Garlic is great, paprika and chili powder will work in the
stuffing, V-8 instead of tomato juice is pleasantly different.

1/2 cup catsup
1 1/2 pound beef, lean ground
1/2 pound pork, ground
2  eggs; lightly beaten
1 cup bread crumbs, very fine

Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl and set aside. Melt
the butter in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions, celery,
bell peppers, green onions, garlic, Tabasco, Worcestershire and seasoning
mix. Saute until mixture starts sticking excessively, about 6 minutes,
stirring occasionally and scraping the pan bottom well.

Stir in the milk and catsup. Continue cooking for about 2 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Remove from heat and allow mixture to cool to room
temperature.

Place the ground beef and pork in an ungreased 13x9-inch baking pan. Add
the eggs, the cooked vegetable mixture and the bread crumbs, remove the bay
leaves. Mix by hand until thoroughly combined. In the center of the pan,
shape the mixture into a loaf that is about 1-1/2 inches high, 6 inches
wide and 12 inches long. Bake uncovered at 350ø F for 25 minutes, then
raise heat to 400ø F and continue cooking until done, about 35 minutes
longer.

Serve immediately as is or with Very Hot Cajun Sauce for Beef. This is best
using both ground pork and ground beef, as the pork gives more flavor
diversity. However, you can make it with ground beef only.

Cajun Prime Rib

main dish, meats, cajun

4 pound prime rib roast (10-1/2 pounds)
1/4 cup black pepper
1/4 cup garlic powder
1/4 cup salt
2 each onions, thinly sliced
      ----SEASONING MIX (OPTIONAL----
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon, salt
1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoon, white pepper
1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoon, fennel seeds
1 tablespoon plus 3/4 teaspoon, black pepper
2 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
2 1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper

Remove fat cap off top of meat (butcher can do this for you) and
save.  Place the roast, standing on the rib bones, in a very large
roasting pan.  Then with a knife make several dozen punctures through
the silver skin so seasoning can permeate meat.  Pour a very generous,
even layer of black pepper over the top of the meat (the pepper should
completely cover it); repeat with the garlic powder, then the salt,
totally covering the preceding layer.  Carefully arrange the onions
in an even layer on top so as not to knock off the seasoning.  Place
the fat cap back on top.  Refrigerate 24 hours.
Bake ribs in a 550F oven until the fat is dark brown and crispy on
top, about 35 minutes.  Remove from oven and cool slightly.
Refrigerate until well chilled, about 3 hours.  (this is done so the
juices will solidify and the steaks can be cooked rare.)  Remove fat
cap and disgard.  With the blade of a large knife, scrape off the
onions and as much of the seasonings as possible and discard.  Then
with a long knife, slice between ribs into 6 steaks (4 will have
bones); trim the cooked surface of meat from the 2 pieces that were
on the outside of the roast.  Season and cook in your favorite way
for steaks. TO BLACKEN THE STEAKS:  Combine the ingredients of the
seasoning mix thoroughly in a small bowl; you will have about 8
tablespoons. Sprinkle the steaks generously and evenly on both sides
with the mix. using about 4 teaspoons on each steak and pressing it
in with your hands.
Heat a cast iron skillet over very high heat until it is beyond the
smoking stage and you see white ash on the skillet bottom--at least
10 minutes.  (The skillet cannot be too hot for this method.)  Place
one steak in the hot skillet (cook only one side at a time) and cook
over a very high heat until the underside starts to develop a heavy,
black crust, about 2 to 3 minutes.  Turn the steak over and cook until
the underside is crusted like the first, about 2 to 3 minutes more.
Repeat with the remaining steaks.  Serve each steak while piping hot.
(*NOTE*:  If you don't have a commercial hood vent over your stove,
this dish may smoke you out of the kitchen.  It's worth it!  But you
can also cook it outdoors on a gas grill; a charcoal fire doesn't get
hot enough to "blacken" the steak properly.  If you have a smoke
detector in your house, you will be able to determine if it is working
correctly.  This is NOT a dish to prepare in an apartment building
with a central fire alarm system wired into your smoke detector.  It
causes great excitement!  Also, you can be guaranteed you will meet
your landlord.)

1 1/4 teaspoon white pepper
3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
3/4 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
3/4 cup evaporated milk
2 pound potatoes, peeled and quartered
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon white pepper

1 cup julienned onions  (see note)
      ----VEGETABLE SEASONING MIX----
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
      ----VEGETABLES----
1 1/2 cup julienned zucchini (see note
1 cup julienned squash (see note)
1  very hot Cajun sauce/beef

NOTE:  To julienne squashes, cut peelings 1/8 inch thick and cut these into
strips 1/8 inch wide and 2 inches long; use only strips that have skin on
one surface. Cut carrots and onions into similar strips.
In a 13x9-inch ungreased baking pan, combine the beef and pork. Mix in
the eggs and bread crumbs by hand until thoroughly mixed. Set aside. In a
1-quart saucepan, combine 3 tablespoons of the butter, the onions, celery,
bell peppers, garlic, Worcestershire, Tabasco and meat seasoning mix. Saute
over high heat about 5 minutes, stirring frequently and scraping the pan
bottom well.  Remove from heat and cool. Add the sauteed vegetable mixture

Meanwhile, boil the potatoes until fork tender; drain, reserving about 1
cup of the water.  Place the potatoes, while still hot, in a large mixing
bowl with the remaining 1 stick butter, 1/2 cup milk, the salt and white
pepper.  Stir with a wooden spoon until broken up, then beat with a metal
whisk (or electric mixer with a paddle) until creamy and velvety smooth.
(NOTE: Mix in some of the reserved potato water if potatoes are not creamy
enough.)  In a large skillet (preferably non-stick) combine the reserved
drippings with the carrots, onions and vegetable seasoning mix; saute over
high heat 1-1/2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the zucchini and yellow
squash and continue sauteing until vegetables are noticeably brighter in
color, about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat.
Mound undrained vegetables on top of the meat loaf, away from the edges.
Layer the mashed potatoes evenly over the top of the vegetables and top
edges of the meat, using all the potatoes. Bake at 525F until brown on top,
about 8 to 10 minutes.  Serve immediately with about 1/2 cup Very Hot Cajun
Sauce (see recipe) under each serving. From Paul Prudhommes "Louisiana

1 pound ground beef
1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
1  egg; slightly beaten
3/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1  heavy aluminum foil
2 medium zucchini
2 cup prepared spaghetti sauce
1  grated Parmesan cheese
1  garlic bread sticks - (optional)

1. In medium bowl, combine ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, 1/4 cup
water, garlic salt and pepper, mixing lightly but thoroughly. Shape
into 24 (approx 1-1/4 inch) meatballs.

2. cut the zucchini lengthwise in half, sliced crosswise 1/2-inch thick

3. Cut four 18x12 inch long sheets heavy duty aluminum foil. Place
equal amounts of meatballs and zucchini in center of each; top each
with 1/3 cup spaghetti sauce. Bring shorter edges of foil together
over the center; fold down loosely to seal, allowing room for heat
expansion and circulation. Fold in open ends to seal.

4. Place packets on grid over medium ash-covered coals, Grill,
uncovered, 16 to 18 minutes or until meatball centers are no longer
pink and zucchini is tender, truning packets over once.

5. To serve, carefully unfold ends and tops of packets; sprinkle
cheese over meatballs. Serve with garlic bread sticks, dipping into
sauce, if desired.

Cooks tip: To check the temperature of the coals, cautiously hold
your hand palm side down, at cooking height (just above the grid).
Count the number of seconds you can hold your hand in that position
before the heat is uncomfortable and you have to pull it away; 4
seconds for medium coals.

To prepare indoors, preheat oven to 400°F. Place packets on baking sheet;
bake 30-35 minutes.

Caribbean Cabbage

meats, vegetables

4  pork steaks
1  small cabbage head
4  carrots
1 cup chicken stock or broth
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1 tablespoon ground allspice
1  salt and pepper; to taste
1 tablespoon butter, margerine or oil
2 tablespoon water; for deglazing

Brown pork steaks in butter, margerine or oil. Set aside to cool.
Deglaze skillet with 2 tablespoon water. Pour liquor into a 4 qt pot. Cut
carots into 1/8" thick slices. Add to pot and set pot over medium
heat. Add chicken stock, garlic salt, allspice, salt and pepper to
pot. Remove any bones from the pork steaks and cut them crosswise
into 1/4" wide strips. Add the pork strips to the pot. Core and
coarsly chop the cabbage. Add to pot. Stir well to mix all the
ingredients. Cover the pot and allow the meat and vegetables to steam
for a few minutes, but not too long. The carrots and cabbage should
still be somewhat crisp (al dente) when served. Serve with steamed
rice. OPTIONS: Alter spices any way you like. Add, delete or
substitute any of the ingredients. This dish is versatile, fast, easy
and very inexpensive. Since this is my first attempt at uploading
from MM to the Food Forum, I thought this was an appropriate recipe.
It's the first thing I ever cooked that had more than one ingredient.
It dates back to my college days (early 60's) when I, nor my
roommates, had much money. We had to build meals for four hungry guys
on a budget that allowed less than five bucks per meal. One of the
group hailed from Jamaica W.I. He devised this recipe based (loosly)
on something his grandmother prepared. It cost less than two bucks to
feed us all. Needless to say we started eating a variation of this
recipe almost every night. On Friday night we spent the money we had
saved to buy the five basic food groups (chili dogs, fries, pizza,
burgers and beer). Today, thirty years later, this recipe will still
feed four people for less than five dollers and takes less than 20
minutes to make.

Chaamp Masala (Lamb Chops Masala)

main dish, meats, indian

3  in piece of fresh ginger
1  peeled and coarsely chopped
3 tablespoon peeled and coarsely chopped
1  garlic
6  8 lamb chops from the ribs,
1  remove all extra fat
8 fl ounce ounce grated or finely chopped
1  tomatoes
2 medium sized onions very finely
1  chopped
1 tablespoon cayenne
12 fl ounce ounce greek yoghurt beaten
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground roasted cumin seeds
1  2 tsps punjabi garam masala
3 tablespoon lemon juice
2  3 tbsps chopped fresh green
1  coriander

Put the ginger and garlic into the container of an electric blender
with 2-3 tablespoons of water and blend to a paste.

Put the chops, tomatoes, onions, cayenne pepper, yoghurt, salt and
ginger-garlic paste into a large wok or heavy-bottomed saucepan. Stir
and bring to the boil. Turn the heat to low, cover and simmer for 50
minutes or until the chops are almost cooked. Add the cumin seeds and
simmer for 10 to 15 minutes or until the meat is tender and the sauce
thick. Add the garam masala and lemon juice and stir.

Sprinkle fresh coriander over the top and serve.

TIPS

In the Punjab, tomatoes are grated to make a puree - don't be tempted
to use ready-prepared tomato puree instead of fresh.

The spice combinations in garam masala vary in different parts of
India. In the Punjab this one which you can try making yourself is
common: 5 tbsps coriander seeds, 3 tbsps cumin seeds, 2 1/2 tbsps
black peppercorns, 2 1/2 black cardamom seeds, 2 in cinnamon stick,
4-5 cloves, 1/6 nutmeg. Put the coriander and the cumin into a
cast-iron frying-pan over a medium heat. Stir until lightly roasted.
Allow to cool. Grind with the remaining ingredients in a clean coffee
grinder and store in a tightly lidded jar.

Madhur Jaffrey's Flavours of India - Punjab

This rich flavoursome dish originates in the fertile Punjab, a state
now divided between India and Pakistan. There is nothing more
important to a Punjabi man's diet than bread, and meals are
accompanied by flat round cornbread rotis or rich, flaky pan-fried
paratha layered with ghee (clarified butter).

Rice is reserved for special occasions or for rice pudding, for the
only food that makes a Punjabi feel he has eaten a proper meal is his
bread! You of course, can serve this dish with plain boiled rice.

2 slice sweet red onion
4 slice bacon, cooked until crisp
2 slice tomato (optional)
1  mayonnaise

Preheat your grill, and toss on the hamburger patties and onion
slices. Grill until the onions are nicely browned and the patties are
done to your liking (medium rare around here). Add the split kaiser
rolls, cut side down, a few minutes before the burgers are done, to
allow the rolls to toast slightly.  When you put the rolls on the
grill, also place the blue cheese slices on top of the hamburger
patties.

Spread toasted rolls lightly with mayonnaise, top with the patties,
bacon slices, grilled onions, a tomato slice. Cover with the top of
the remaining half of the rolls, and chow down.

Chicken Dog #1

poultry, makemeat

3  feet small hog or sheep casings
3 pound chicken meat-15% fat
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon finely fround coriander
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
1/2 teaspoon ground mace
1/2 teaspoon finely ground mustard seed
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon fine grind white pepper
1 teaspoon sugar
1 1/2 teaspoon salt

Prepare casings. Mix the remaining ingredients together. If you desire a
sausage like texture, grind through the fine disk twice and stuff. If you
desire a texture more like commercial hot dogs, process a third at a time
in a food processor until it has a thick puree like consistency. The result
is harder to stuff, but seems more like a "real" hot dog. Tie off into 5"
lengths. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the links, without
separating them, immediately reduce the heat and simmer very gently for 30
minutes. Remove and place in ice water. chill thoroughly. Remove, pat dry,
and refrigerate up to a week or freeze.

Chimicangas

mexican, beef

1 pound ground beef
1 medium sized chopped onion
1/2 cup enchilada sauce (canned is fine)

first, make the meat filling Brown the meat and drain. Add the onion,
cook until soft.  Add the

sauce and let simmer for 10 minutes Now you're ready to really start.
12 flour tortillas(7 inches in diameter) 2 1/4 cups of meat
filling(from above) 1 1/2 to 2 cups each of shredded Cheddar cheese,
shredded lettuce, and chopped green onions or radishes Sour cream

Spoon 3 tablespoons of the filling down the center of tortilla.

Fold tortilla around filling, and fasten with wooden toothpicks.
Assemble only 2 or 3 at a time, or the tortilla will absorb liquid
from the filling. Fry in 1 inch of hot oul over medium heat
(350degrees), turning,

until golden; takes 1 to 2 minutes.  Lift from fat with a slotted
spoon, draining, then place on a thick layer of paper towels; keep in
a warm place until all are cooked. Serve garnished with 2 or 3
tablespoons each shredded cheese, lettuce,

and radishes or green onions, and add sour cream to taste. Do not
forget to remove the toothpicks before serving.  I've done

it once, and it is extremely painful. These aren't quite like the
ones you get in restaurants, because

they use huge platter-sized tortillas.  They are still a grease
maniac's dream--very greasy, very tasty.  You can use animal fat or
lard to fry up the chimichangas, I believe, but I would suggest using
vegetable oil. It works just fine, and the other way will probably
cause a cholesterol overload.  Otherwise, it's fantastic.

Cider Marinated Beef Roast

main dish, meats, beef

4 pound boneless rump, sirloin tip
2 cup apple cider
2/3 cup salad oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 cup chopped onion
3  cloves garlic, smashed
1  bay leaf
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon thyme
1 teaspoon mustard, dry
1 teaspoon allspice
1/2 teaspoon black pepper, fresh ground
2 tablespoon cornstarch

Here's  a boneless beef roast marinated in a flavorful apple-cider,
onion- garlick mixture.  Surprisingly good. The meat must be cooked
to RARE or MEDIUM-RARE for its optimum tenderness, which may be bad
news for those of you who like it well-done, but well-done, in this
case, will prove to be tougher than the medium-rare. The acidic
action of the cider makes all the difference in  the world in terms
of tenderness. Combine that with the marinating and the slow
roasting, tenderness IS the name of the game. You can garnish this
one with crab apples and parsley for making pretty. Directions for
beef roast: Make a couple of dozen slits in the meat on the outside
about an inch deep. Place in a glass or plastic bowl. Combine the
apple cider, oil, lemon juice, onion, garlick, bay leaf, salt, thyme,
allspice, mustard and pepper; pour the marinade over the meat. Cover
and marinate in the refrigerator at least four hours. Maybe more.
Remove the roast from the marinade. Place on a roasting pan and
insert the meat thermometer so it reaches the thickest part. Roast at
300 degrees until the thermometer reaches 140 degrees, about 2 hours
for rare meat (meat continues to cook after it is out of the oven).
Remove onto a warm platter. Strain the marinade.   Skim the fat from
the roasting pan, and add the marinade to the drippings.   Reserve 2
to 3 tablespoon of the marinade liquid to mix with the cornstarch. Stir the
cornstarch into the boiling liquid and cook until thickend.
Glaze the roast with the sauce.    Slice  *very thinly* to serve.
Especially  good served with potato casserole (or the new
potato-garlick recipe you just saw posted here), glazed carrots,
green salad, garlick bread.

Classic Meatloaf

main dish, meats

1 1/2 pound lean ground beef
8 ounce tomato sauce
1 cup soft bread crumbs
1 small onion; finely chopped
1  egg; slightly beaten
2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon dry mustard

By shaping the ground beef mixture into small, two-serving loaves,
baking time can be reduced by 30 minutes. Gentle handling when mixing
the ground beef with the other ingredients will ensure a moist,
tender meatloaf.

Preparation and cooking time: 1 hr.

1. Heat oven to 350 F. Reserve 1/4 cup tomato sauce. In large bowl,
combine ground beef, remaining tomato sauce, bread crumbs, onion, egg,
Worcestershire sauce, thyme, garlic salt and pepper, mixing lightly
but thoroughly.

2. Divide mixture into thirds and shape to form three loaves, each
about 1-1/2 inches thick; place on rack in open roasting pan. Combine
reserved tomato sauce, brown sugar and mustard; spread over top of
loaves.

3. Bake in 350 F oven 40 to 45 minutes or until no longer pink and
juices run clear. To serve cut each meatloaf into 1-inch thick slices.

Cook's tip: To make soft bread crumbs, place torn bread slices in food
processor, fitted with steel blade, or blender container. Cover;
process 30 seconds, pulsing on and off, until fine crumbs. One and a
half slices will yield 1 cup soft bread crumbs.

Clyde's Meatloaf

meats

1/2 cup old-fashioned oatmeal
1/2 cup + 2 teaspoon honey
1/2 cup milk
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1  salt and fresh pepper
2 1/2 pound ground chuck
3/4 cup grated carrots
1/3 cup ketchup
1 teaspoon dry mustard

1. Combine the oatmeal, honey and milk in a large mixing bowl. Allow
to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375F.

2. Heat the oil in a saute pan over medium heat and add the onion and
garlic. Add salt and pepper to taste, and saute until the onion is
translucent and softened slightly.

3. Add the onion to the oatmeal mixture, along with the meat, add
salt to taste, and plenty of black pepper. Add the grated carrots,
mix thoroughly, and place in a non-stick 9 x 5 x 3 loaf pan. (If
using a regular loaf pan, oil it lightly.) Place the loaf pan on a
cookie sheet to catch any spills and put in oven. (Typist's note: I
used a bundt pan and it works much better -- no boil over of grease).

4. Bake the meatloaf for 50 minutes. Remove from oven and carefully
tip the pan to drain off the excess fat and liquid, and then turn the
meatloaf out onto the cookie sheet. Turn right side up. Combine the
ketchup and mustard and spread the mixture over the top of the
meatloaf. Return meatloaf to the oven and bake for an additional 20
minutes.

Colonel Hatch's Chorizo

meats

1/2 cup hatch red enchilada sauce
3 teaspoon oregano
1/2 cup dried red chiles; ground
2 1/2 pound lean ground beef (or half beef; half pork, ground)

Colonel Hatch's Chorizo (from the Hatch Chile Cookbook)

NOTE: Use only ground beef or beef and pork mixture in this recipe.

Mix the enchilada sauce and the oregano with the ground chile. Put
the meat in a large glass bowl or non-reactive pan. Cover the meat
with the sauce and marinate overnight in the refrigerator. Next, pour
off any excess liquid. To cook, crumble the desired amount with a
fork and fry in a skillet. The chorizo may be frozen into serving
size packages, or may be stuffed into sausage casings. Makes 40
sausages. *Please note: recipe requires advance preparation.

Dot's notes: I used half ground beef, half ground pork, dried
oregano, and Hatch-brand enchilada sauce. Now you know why I'm always
on the prowl for Hatch-brand stuff in Michigan. This recipe makes a
lot of chorizo. I divided it into some 4 and some 8 ounce. portions,
wrapped it tightly in plastic wrap, then aluminum foil and froze it.
It makes absolutely wonderful breakfast burritos and you can also use
it in the Blue Cornbread and Chorizo stuffing recipe found in Steven
Pyle's New Texas Cuisine. Enjoy.

Continental Stuffed Green Peppers

vegetables, beef

1 tablespoon oil
2 large garlic clove; crushed
1/2 cup onion; diced
16 ounce tomato, whole
1/2 cup tomato purée
1/2 cup wine, white, dry
1 teaspoon sugar, granulated
1/4 teaspoon oregano, dried
1/4 teaspoon basil, dried
1/8 teaspoon thyme, dried
1/2 cup rice, long grain; uncooked
1 pound ground chuck
1  salt and pepper; to taste
4 large bell pepper, green; halved lengthwise & seede

While these were not on the menu every day, they did put them out
once in a while.  This may be a little jazzed up but is one of the
best that I have tried.

In a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat, heat the vegetable oil and
add the garlic and onion cooking for about 10 minutes, stirring
frequently, until tender. Add the tomatoes and liquid, tomato puree,
wine, sugar, basil, oregano and thyme and bring to a boil. Reduce the
heat to low and simmer the sauce, covered, 20 minutes. Meanwhile,
prepare the rice according to the directions on the package and set
aside, covered to keep warm. Heat the oven to 350 degrees F.  In a
medium-size skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef, stirring,
until well browned. Remove from the heat and drain off the excess
fat. Stir in the rice, 1/2 cup of the sauce and season with salt and
pepper to taste. Spoon the mixture into the pepper halves and place
the peppers, filling side down, in a 13 X 9 X2-inch baking pan. Pour
the remaining sauce over the peppers and cover with foil. Bake for 35
to 40 minutes.

Country-Style Bolognese Sauce

meats, vegetables, beef, italian, sauces

1/4 pound bacon -- chopped
1 medium onion -- finely chopped
6  cloves garlic -- finely
1  chopped/crush
1  celery stalk -- finely
1  chopped
1 medium carrot -- finely chopped
3 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound lean -- ground beef
1 cup chicken or beef broth --
1  (canned consomme is
1 cup dry white wine
4 cup canned peeled Italian
1  tomatoes -- roughly cut,
1  undrain
1 small can tomato paste
1 teaspoon salt
1  freshly ground pepper
1 tablespoon oregano
1 dash red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg -- freshly grated

In a small skillet or frypan, fry the bacon.  Drain off the fat as it
accumulates in the pan.  Remove from skillet when bacon is leathery
but not yet crisp. Distribute bacon on one or two paper towels, roll
them up, and give them a good squeeze so the paper absorbs most of
the remaining bacon fat.  Set aside.  Heat the oil in a deep, heavy
non-aluminum kettle (an enameled cast iron casserole or large skillet
will do) and add the vegetables.  Cook, stirring, over low heat until
the onions are translucent and the vegetables are softened. Add the
beef, using a wooden spoon to break up any lumps. Cook only until the
meat loses its raw red color. Do not let it brown.  Add the cooked
bacon, broth, and wine, raise the heat, and cook until the sauce
thickens a little. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, pepper,
oregano, pepper flakes, and nutmeg, and stir well. Taste and adjust
the seasonings. When the sauce begins to bubble, lower the heat and
simmer very slowly, partly covered, for about 4 hours. Stir
occasionally to prevent sticking. Before serving, taste again for
seasoning and adjust.

This sauce freezes well and keeps for about a week in the
refrigerator. If you cannot find lean ground beef, pick out a round
steak or some sirloin and have the butcher trim and grind it for you.

Couscous

lamb/mutton, moroccan

2/3 cup dried chickpeas
3 tablespoon olive oil
2 pound lean, boneless lamb shoulder
1/2 cup chopped white onions
5 cup boiling water
3 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1/2 cup ripe tomatoes
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1  bay leaf
2 teaspoon crushed dried mint
1 teaspoon (scant) salt (or to taste)
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
4  medium-sized carrots
3 small turnips
2 cup couscous
3 small zucchini
2  Italian sweet peppers

1.  Soak the chickpeas overnight in four times their volume of water
in a noncorrisble bowl.

2.  Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed 5- to 7-quart pot.

3.  Cut the lamb into 1-inch cubes.  Brown them (in batches, if
necessary) on all sides over moderate heat. Transfer the meat to a
warm platter.

4.  Reduce the temperature to low and saute the onions for 2 minutes,
stirring frequently.

5.  Add the lamb, boiling water, lemon juice, tomatoes, cinnamon,
nutmeg, bay leaf, mint, salt, and pepper. Stir, cover, and simmer the
mixture vfor 20 minutes.

6.  Drain the chickpeas and stir them into the lamb mixture. Simmer
the ingredients, covered, for 45 minutes.

7.  Begin this step 5 minutes before step 6 is completed. Peel the
carrots and turnips.  Cut the carrots into 3/4-inch long segments and
the turnips into 3/4-inch cubes.  When step 6 is completed, stir
these ingredients into the pot containing the lamb. Simmer, covered,
for 15 minutes.

8.  Begin this step as soon as the carrots and turnips start
simmering in step 7.  Put the couscous pellets in a 2- to 3-quart
pan. Pour cold tap water into the pan until it reaches a depth of 1
inch above the pellets. Soak the pellets for 10 minutes.

9.  Pour the couscous into a sieve, discarding the water. Return the
couscous to its soaking pan.  Slowly strain two cups of the broth
from the large pot into the couscous. Bring this mixture to a simmer.
Cover, and cook for 5 minutes over low heat.

10.  Slice the zucchini into 3-inch cuves and the peppers into 1/4
inch-thick rings.  When step 7 is completed, stir in both ingredients
and simmer the mixture, covered, for 10 minutes.

11.  It should be time to turn off the heat under the simmering
couscous pellets as soon as the zucchini-and-pepper mixture starts
simmering in step 10.  Fluff the pellets, cover the pan, and let it
stand for 8 minutes. Then pour off any remaining liquid.

12.  Mound the couscous pellets in the center of a warm, large serving
platter.  Using a slotted spoon, remove the meat and vegetables from
the pot and neatly arrange them around the mound.

Serves 6 to 8.

Creole Smoked Sausage & Creole Hot Sausage

meats, breakfast

3  yards small sausage casing
4 pound lean pork (or 2 pound lean pork and; lb lean beef)
2 pound pork fat
2 teaspoon finely minced garlic
2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
3 tablespoon salt
2 teaspoon cayenne
1/2 teaspoon ground bay leaf
1/4 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
4 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon sugar
5 teaspoon colgin's liquid hickory smoke

New Orleans' most popular sausage, a type of country sausage made with
pork, or pork and beef. It's not really smoked, but has a fine smokey
flavor that makes it an ideal seasoning meat for our favorite bean
dishes, gumbos, and jambalayas.  We also like it pan grilled as a
breakfast or dinner sausage. [Also makes great po-boys--ECT] Allow
about 20 to 25 minutes for grilling. When used as a seasoning meat in
other dishes, it requires no precooking. About 6 pounds of 6-8 inch
sausage (To make HOT sausage, omit the liquid hickory smoke and add 1
teaspoon cayenne and 1 teaspoon black pepper.)  Hot sausage is a good
accompaniment to bean dishes or smothered vegetables or as a
breakfast sausage with grits and eggs. It is not recommended as a
seasoning meat in traditional bean dishes as it is likely to
overwhelm the flavor of the other ingredients. Prepare the sausage
casings and stuffing. Mix ingredients lightly; the stuffing should be
slightly coarse in texture.  Cut the casing into 12 inch lengths and
stuff.  Allow 2 smoked sausages per serving.

1 teaspoon salt
1  bay leaf
2 teaspoon thyme leaves (not ground thyme)
5  cloves, whole
2  yellow onions
1 cup cornmeal (coarse)
1/2 teaspoon cayenne
1/2 teaspoon sage leaves (not powdered sage)
1 pound pork liver
3  garlic cloves
1/4 pound butter (1 stick)

Peel and dice one onion.  Simmer pork ribs with salt, bay, thyme, cloves
and onion in the water till the meat falls off the bones. Remove the bones
and gristle, rub the meat into fibers (with your fingers), and reduce this
pork liquor to about 4 cups by further boiling.

Cool 1 cup of the pork liquor and mix it with coarse corn meal and cayenne.
Add the sage, rubbing it between your fingers to crush it as you put it in.

In your Cuisinart, using the steel blade, grind pork liver, the other
onion, and the garlic cloves. Fry the resulting slurry in butter. Add the
cornmeal mixture and the pork-liver mixture to the pork liquor and simmer
the whole thing over a very low flame (or in the top of a double boiler)
for half an hour. Spread thin into two 9-inch square pans to cool. (The
pans needn't be greased.)

To serve, cut and fry squares or fingers with sunny-side-up eggs on the
side.

Curried Lamb Chops

lamb

8  lamb chops, preferably from the rac; k, about 2 lbs
1  salt and freshly ground pepper to t; aste
1 tablespoon curry powder
1 tablespoon peanut oil
1 tablespoon butter
2 tablespoon finely chopped shallots
1/3 cup dry white wine
1/2 cup fresh or canned chicken broth
1 teaspoon tomato paste
1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley

Lamb is one of the greatly under-utilized meats here in the US, I
think. There are a variety of recipes from around the world to
inspire you. Actually, I was looking for my Mongolian lamb recipe but
don't have it typed in (just use any ol' Mongolian beef recipe and
substitute lamb for the beef and don't over cook it).

Sprinkle the chops on both sides with salt and pepper. Rub them on
both sides with curry powder to coat evenly.

Heat oil in a skillet large enough to hold the chops in one layer.
Add the chops and cook until browned on one side, about 2 minutes.
Turn and brown on second side, about 2 minutes. Turn onto the fatty
rims and continue cooking until the rims are rendered of fat, about 2
minutes.

Turn the chops flat side down and cook, turning them occasionally. The
total cooking time should be about 15 minutes. Transfer the chops to
a dish and pour off all the fat from the skillet.

Add 1 tablespoon of the butter to the skillet and heat. Add the
shallots and cook, stirring, about 15 seconds. Add the wine and bring
to a boil. Cook for about 1 minute and then add the chicken broth and
tomato paste. Cook over moderately high heat until reduced to about
1/3 cup. Swirl in the remaining butter and pour the sauce over the
chops. Serve sprinkled with parsley.

Serves 4.

      ----DEEP FRIED GINGER BEEF----
10 ounce flank steak
      ----BATTER----
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2  egg - beaten
1/4 cup cornstarch
2 tablespoon cornstarch
1 1/2 tablespoon flour
1 teaspoon pepper - freshly ground
      ----GARNISH----
2 ounce bell pepper - green
2 ounce bell pepper - red
2 ounce ginger root - finely chopped
1/2 ounce garlic - mashed
      ----SAUCE----
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoon soy sauce
1 1/2 tablespoon mushroom soy sauce
1 tablespoon white vinegar
1 tablespoon honey
1/2 tablespoon cooking wine
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 tablespoon powdered chili
10 cup cooking oil
3 tablespoon cooking oil

Cutting against the grain, slice flank steak into strips about 2
inches long by 1/4 inch wide. (slightly frozen meat makes this task
easier -- FHT). Combine batter ingredients and mix with steak slices;
toss to coat and set aside.

Cut up green and red peppers into same size strips and mix with
garlic and ginger.

Combine sauce ingredients and set aside.

To cook Ginger Fried Beef, put 10 cups of cooking oil into a deep
fryer or pot and preheat to 250 F.  Fry coated meat mixture, a few
pieces at a time, until crispy, about seven to ten minutes. Set meat
aside on paper towel to drain and keep oil at the same temperature
for second stage frying.

Put 3 Tbsp cooking oil in wok and heat.  Add green and red pepper
mixture and stir-fry over high heat 15 to 20 seconds. Add sauce
mixture and cook another 15 to 20 seconds until somewhat thickened.
Cooking times may be a little longer on a conventional stove.

Deep fry beef a second time for one minute.  Remove from oil and add
to stir fry; toss lightly to coat thoroughly and serve.

Deep-Dish Pizza

main dish, meats, cheese, diabetic

1 pound ground turkey
2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 cup margarine or butter
1/2 cup to 3/4 c skim milk
6 ounce can tomato paste
1 teaspoon oregano leaves; dried
1/2 teaspoon basil leaves; dried
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup green bell pepper; chopped
1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1/4 pound mozzarella cheese; grate 1cup

Suggestion:  for 2 servings, use a small aluminum foil pan about 4 x 8
inches or press a sheet of aluminum foil into a loaf pan and set the foil
pan on a cookie sheet.  Measure half the other ingredients and freeze the
remaining 3 ounces of tomato paste for a future meal.

Preheat the oven to 425 F.  Cook the ground turkey in a large nonstick
skillet over medium heat until cooked through.  Stir occasionally.

Combine flour, baking powder, and margarine in a bowl.  Cut the margarine
into the flour with a fork until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add
enough milk to make a soft, elastic dough (like biscuit dough). Press the
dough into the sides and bottom of an 8-inch square baking pan.

Combine the tomato paste and seasonings and spread over the dough. Crumble
the ground turkey over the sauce.  Sprinkle on the green pepper, mushrooms
and cheese.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the crust is brown and
crisp.  Cut into four squares to serve.

Dhana Ghosht

meats, indian

1 1/2 pound stewing lamb, trimmed of fat and di; ced
2 cup yogurt (full-fat), natural
6  garlic cloves, crushed
4 teaspoon coriander, ground
2  lila murcha, (fresh green chili pep; pers), crushed
4 teaspoon paprika
4 teaspoon salt (or less)
3 teaspoon ginger, coarsely crushed
4 tablespoon cooking oil (mustard oil is best)
2 medium onions (or more to taste)
3 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon turmeric powder
2 teaspoon black mustard seed
2 teaspoon red chili powder (also called cayen; ne pepper or lal mirch)
4 ounce coriander, fresh

Dice the meat into bite-size cubes and soak in warm water for 2-3 minutes.

Mix the paprika, ground coriander, salt, crushed garlic and crushed green
chilies with yogurt.  Drain the lamb and add to the yogurt marinade. Leave
to marinate for at least six hours. Ideally it should marinate in the
refrigerator for 24 hours.

Dice the onions into thin semi-circles.  In a large saucepan or a generous
frying-pan,  heat the cooking oil over a high flame.  Add the onions when
the oil is hot enough to "steam." Reduce the heat to medium and stir
occasionally.  Fry the onions until they change colour to a deep red/brown.
This should take 10 to 15 minutes.

At this point add the black mustard seeds and stir a few times.  Then add
the ginger, cumin seeds, red chilies and turmeric powder. Increase the heat
and fry this "masala" for a couple of minutes. Add the marinated lamb to
the masala and mix well.

At this point you have two options, either to cook the meat on the stove or
to bake it. Stove-top cooking takes less time but requires fairly constant
stirring.  It should be cooked in a covered saucepan on a low to medium
flame for about 45 minutes. Add water if the sauce gets too dry and begins
to stick. For baking, transfer it to an ovenproof casserole, cover it, and
bake for 1 1/2 hours at 200 degrees F. Check occasionally, though you are
unlikely to need to add any water to the sauce.

Finally, prepare and wash the fresh coriander in cold water.  Only the
leaves and the tender stems should be retained. Chop coarsely and mix well
just before serving. If you don't have any fresh coriander, then mix in
about 2-3 teaspoon of coriander powder. Serve with well buttered (boiled)
rice or
pita bread and fresh salad.

NOTES:

*  A popular North Indian lamb dish with coriander -- This is a family
variation on a popular North Indian dish.  I cook it whenever I could get
hold of fresh coriander, which in Edinburgh is seldom.

I don't know its authentic Indian name.  We simply call it "dhana lamb" as
that's how its always cooked at home.  Dhana means "coriander" in Gujarati.
Yield:  Serves 3-4.

*  Take care not to burn the onions and don't overcook the masala just
before mixing in the marinated meat.

*  I think the dish tastes a lot better if it is baked.  It's even better
if cooked for a longer period at a lower temperature.

: Difficulty:  easy to moderate.
: Time:  15 minutes preparation, 1 day marinating, 2 1/2 hours cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

3/4 cup instant oatmeal
2 single eggs, beaten
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup tomato juice
1  onion, minced
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper

***There are a few rules to Diner Meatloaf that cannot be broken
because the essential "dinerhood" of the dish would be compromised.
Don't use lean meat or sirloin. Ground chuck, 20% fat will mean the
meatloaf will be juicy.  Don't skimp on the oatmeal or if you choose,
bread crumbs. You need the pulpy texture to soak up the gravy. Don't
undercook, you are striving for a "grey". Preheat oven 350. Mix beef,
pork, oatmeal, and eggs. Blend in milk, tomato juice, onion,
Worcestershire, and seasonings. Pack firmly into a 9x5" loaf pan,
shaping a rounded top.  Bake 1 1/2 hrs. Let stand 10 mins before
slicing.  Drain off any excess juice at bottom of pan.

Easter Lamb

main dish, meats, italian

1  bulb of fresh fennel (anise)
4 tablespoon chopped garlic or more if you like
1  salt and plenty of fresh ground pep; per

Get a leg of lamb and ask the butcher to bone it and butterfly it
for you. Do not let him tie it in a roast but ask him for some
butcher string so you can do it by yourself. When you get the lamb
home, try to remove as much fat from the inside as possible if the
butcher didn`t clean it well. Now you are going to make your own
roast of boneless lamb.

To begin...Lay the meat out flat on a large clean surface skin side
down. Cut off the fuzzy top of the fennel and wash thoroughly. cut
into 4" stalks using everything (save the bulb) Cover the meat first
with salt and pepper. Spread the garlic all over the meat. Lay the
pieces of fennel next spread over the meat. Now roll up like a
jellyroll and start tying with the string about 2 " apart. Get it as
tight as you can. Then tie it lengthwise tucking the ends in. Place
in a roasting pan and lightly oil top and sides. Salt an pepper the
roast. Cut the fennel bulb into chunks and drizzle with about 2 tbls
of melted butter or oli. Bake at 350 for about 1 hour covered. Turn
every 1/2 hour. Remove cover and continue to bake 1 hour uncovered.
Before the last 1/2 hour add 1/2 cup white wine. When done, remove
the meat to a warm platter. Do not cut too early, lamb gets cold
fast. Put the roasting pan on top of the stove and make a gravy with
the drippings. Add flour and water. You may even use a bit more wine
or broth, adjust for salt, strain and serve on the side for the meat
or mashed potatoes.

Sift the flour with a pinch of salt into a mixing bowl, or place in a
food processor and mix once or twice. Rub in the margerine and
shortening until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs, or work in
the food processor, being careful not to over-mix. Mix the liquid
gradually, adding enough to bring the pastry together into a ball.
(In a food processor, add the liquid through the funnel while the
motor is running.) Wrap the pastry well, and chill for 20 to 30
minutes.

Brown the ground meat well, and drain away as much of the fat as
possible.

until the onion is soft. Add to the meat. Then add the cocoa, flour,
spices, oregano, and seasonings. Stir well and cook briefly before
adding the chilies and the tomatoes. Cook slowly for 10-15 minutes.

Add the nuts and the olives, and allow to cool. (Oh, you were
supposed to add the parsley with the tomatoes, above.)

Roll out the pastry on a floured surface. (We didn't do this. We ran
the dough through the pasta machine - much easier! We found the #3
setting on our Atlas pasta maker to be the right thickness.)

Cut the dough into 4 inch rounds. (I used a leftover container from
ricotta cheese to get the right size.)

Place about 1-1/2 tablespoons of filling on the dough circle. Fold
over, and press to seal. If the dough is a little dry, moisten the
edges with a little warm water (with your finger) before pressing the
edges together. Crimp the edges with a fork. With a toothpick, prick
several holes on the top of the empanada to allow the steam to escape.

Mix the glaze ingredients together. Place empanadas on a baking
sheet, and brush with the egg glaze.

Bake at 425 for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.

If you like, you can freeze these. To bake frozen empanadas, place the
frozen pastries on a cooking sheet and brush with the egg glaze. Bake
for 30-35 minutes at 425 degrees.

Makes 15 empanadas.

Enchiladas Sabrosas

meats, latin

2 pound ground meat (mixed ground beef and; ground pork)
1 medium onion
1/2  green pepper
5  garlic cloves
1  cilantro bunch
1/2 teaspoon red pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cumin (or more)
1/2 cup wine or sherry
3/4 cup black olives
1 1/2 cup enchilada sauce
1/2 cup tomato sauce (1 small can)
12  corn tortillas
1/2 pound monterey jack cheese
1/2 cup sour cream (optional)
1  oil

Chop onion and garlic; place them in a frying pan with the ground meats.
Saute them without adding fat.  When meat is brown, add the chopped green
pepper and most of the cilantro leaves and cook for another minute or two
(until green pepper is cooked bright green). Drain well, then add (about)
several tablespoons of the enchilada sauce and cook for a few minutes
longer. Set aside.

Make the sauce:  into a saucepan, pour the remaining enchilada sauce (from
the can). Add the can of tomato sauce. Add the wine or sherry, cumin, salt,
red pepper, and cook for 10-30 minutes (depending on how compulsive you
are). The flavor should be smooth (not gritty) and spicy.

Collect together everything that you will need for assembling the
enchiladas. Grate the cheese onto wax paper. Have the olives handy (you'll
be cutting them in half). Lightly oil the baking dish.

The frying pan from which you drained the meat mixture still has some of
its grease left in it. Take 4 tortillas from their package, separate them
from each other, then one-by-one, slide them over the frying pan surface on
each side, to moisten them slightly with the grease. That done, stack them
in the frying pan and heat them until they are soft and pliable.

The final  assembly requires a bit of manual dexterity and speed: Take the
tortillas, and place them (bumpy side out) in the oven dish, curved into a
"U" shape, each right next to its neighbor.  (At this point, start heating
your  next 4 tortillas in the frying pan. I usually wind up preparing 10
tortillas in all.)

Place a small handful of cheese into the U of each tortilla, followed by an
appropriate amount of meat mixture, and finally several olive halves. Then
curl one end of the tortilla around to tuck into the opposite end, and
carefully rotate it to conceal the seam.  Each tortilla should be filled
firmly (not too loosely) but not overflowing the ends.

Once all the filling is used up and the enchiladas are now filled
tortillas, pour the sauce over the top, helping it run into all the
crevices. Sprinkle lightly with remaining cilantro leaves. 10 Cover with
aluminum foil and bake for 20-30 minutes, just until the tortillas are soft
and the sauce is slightly bubbly. Let sit for 5 minutes, then serve, topped
with a dollop of sour cream. If you fail to drain the meat well enough, the
enchiladas will be greasy. If over-baked, it tastes all right, but the
tortillas lose their texture. In general, however, the recipe is quite
forgiving in its proportions. Feel free to adjust the seasoning to your own
tolerance for hot spice. I like to assemble this recipe at least 3 hours
before baking to give the flavors a chance to blend. Left refrigerated for
a day, the seasoning is even less aggressive. Served with a salad (and some
Mexican beer), it's a complete meal.

NOTES:

*  Enchiladas with meat, black olives and cheese -- For many years, I've
been involved in Latin American "solidarity work" here in the San Francisco
area, and as a result, I have learned some of its culinary pleasures. This
recipe originated from the back of a can of enchilada sauce in Mexico, but
was refined by a special Chilean refugee friend who won a scholarship to
the California Culinary Academy (in San Francisco) and now cooks
ever-so-lusciously.  Yield: Serves 6-8.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  1 hour preparation, 30 minutes baking.
: Precision:  Approximate measurement OK, but time the baking carefully.

meats, beef

      ----BILLS20086----
12 pound corned beef brisket
3  bay leaves
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon dill seed
10  whole cloves
1 tablespoon red chiles; chopped
1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns
1 teaspoon ground mace
1 teaspoon cardamom
1 teaspoon mustard seeds
1 tablespoon coriander
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon allspice
1/4 cup salt

Place brisket in heavy stock pot and cover with water. Mix all
seasoning together except salt. Put all ingredients in a cheese-cloth
bag and tie together. Boil brisket and seasoning together with salt
for 2-1/2 to 3 hours. To test, stick a fork in the middle of brisket;
it should come out easy when done. Cool and slice. Pour a little of
the stock over the brisket for added flavor. Serve with your favorite
smothered cabbage recipe. This recipe is from the Fair Grounds Race
Track in New Orleans. They are famous for their corned beef. This
100-year old landmark burned to the ground last year and it was a sad
day for all New Orleanians.

Fajitas

meats, tex mex

3 pound skirt steak
2 large yellow onions
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
16  whole-wheat tortillas
2 cup cheese, grated
3 cup guacamole
      ----MARINADE----
1 cup lime juice
1 tablespoon black pepper, ground
2 tablespoon garlic, minced
      ----PICO DE GALLO----
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
2  scallions, chopped (green onions)
2 large tomatoes, chopped
1 teaspoon garlic, minced

Combine marinade ingredients in a large glass baking dish.  Peel the fatty
membrane from both sides of the skirt steak.  This requires a very sharp
knife.  Add meat to marinade and marinate for at least 4 hours, preferably
overnight.  Keep it in the refrigerator if you marinate overnight.

MAKE THE PICO DE GALLO:  Combine all of the ingredients in a small serving
bowl.

Slice the yellow onions into 1/4-inch slices and cut each slice into a
semi- circle. Grill the meat until it is cooked slightly less than the way
you like it. Meanwhile, saute the onions in the oil until they are soft.
Use a large frying pan that will have enough room for the meat later.

After removing the meat from the grill, slice it into strips that are cut
across the grain.  The strips should be about 3-4 inches long and about 1/4
inch thick.  Add the strips to the onions in the pan and fry for another
minute or two.

Place on the table the pan full of meat, the bowl of pico de gallo, a
basket with the tortillas, a bowl with the guacamole, and a bowl with the
grated cheese. You may wish to provide picante sauce in addition.

NOTES:

*  Barbecued skirt steak marinated in lime:  a Tex-Mex favorite -- Fajitas
originated in Texas as a way to make cheap meat palatable. Unfortunately,
it was too successful. It is still palatable, but because the word is out
that fajitas are so delicious, the meat isn't cheap any more. Because this
is not a traditional Mexican dish but a recent invention of Mexican
immigrants, there is no fixed formula for it. Many different kinds of
marinade are used; this one is adapted from a recipe given to a friend over
the phone by Tortuga's in Austin, Texas.

*  Each person makes her own fajita by taking a tortilla, spooning some of
the meat onto it, then adding her choice of each of the other ingredients
in whatever combination she wants.

*  Skirt steak is somewhat like flank steak:  somewhat tough and with a
very stringy texture. It is covered on both sides with a fatty membrane
that must be removed or the meat will be very tough. The key to good
fajitas is the proper removal of this membrane. Fresh-squeezed lime juice
is best, but bottled will do. Some people from out of state choose to put
sour cream on their fajitas.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  45 minutes preparation, several hours marinating, 10 minutes
cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.

1 cup whiskey or bourbon
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce

1  or peach juice
1 tablespoon finely ground black pepper
1  filling:
1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts and
1  pistachio nuts

strip (about 1/2 inch thick) and the width of the rump roast.

2. Carefully smooth the black pepper thoroughly over all the stripped
rump roast.  Set the roast in a shallow pan (large enough to hold
roast) and smother roast in marinade. Cover and chill for several
hours, the longer the better.

3. Unroll the stripped rump roast and fill with the nut and broccoli
tips. Roll the roast and tie well so filling does not fall out. Place
on a rotisserie. Use the marinade to baste. Cook for at least 2
hours. Remove from spit and remove ties.

Glazed Venison Pate

meats

1 pound venison (trimmed weight)
1/2 pound belly of pork (trimmed wt.)
1/2 pound chicken livers
1 small orange
1  lemon
2  garlic cloves
1 1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme (more to taste)
1  whole and ground bay leaves
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 pint red wine
1 teaspoon gelatine powder
1  a few kumquats to decorate

Mince all three meats fairly finely and put them into a bowl.  Add the zest
of the orange and lemon, the crushed garlic, the thyme, olive oil, vinegar,
a generous pinch of powdered bay and plenty of black pepper. Mix thoroughly
and stir in the wine.  Cover and leave to marinate overnight.

Season with salt - I find 1 teaspoon about right but fry a small nugget of
the mixture to check.  Turn the pate into a terrine of about 2 1/4 pint
capacity.  Pack the mixture well down into the corners of the dish and use
a spoon to hollow out slightly the centre top. Cover with greaseproof paper
and foil, stand the dish in a roasting pan containing enough hot water to
come halfway up the sides of the dish. Bake at 325 F (160 C) gas mark 3 for
2-1/4 to 2-1/2 hours.

Using a bulb baster, remove and reserve most of the juices that surround
the pate.  Replace the greaseproof paper and foil, press the pate lightly
with 1-1/2 to 2 pound weights and cool for 1-1/2 hours. Then drain off any
remaining juices that have not been re-absorbed by the pate. Mix all the
venison juices that you have collected with the juice of the orange and
measure.  Add a splash of water if necessary to make 1/2 pint in total.
Dissolve the gelatine powder in the mixture and use it to glaze the pate,
adding a few bay leaves and kumquats to decorate if liked.

Greek Lamb On Skewers (Arni Souvlakia)

meats, lamb, greek, wine

2 medium onions
3  green bell peppers
4  to 5 pound leg of lamb; boned and cubed
1 teaspoon dried oregano; crumbled
1/2 cup olive oil
3  bay leaves
2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
3  garlic cloves; minced
1  juice of 2 lemons
1 cup dry white wine
1 teaspoon ; salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
6  tomatoes; quartered

Cut onions into quarters and separate layers.  Cut peppers into
quarters, and cut each quarter in half. Combine all ingredients,
except tomatoes, in a shallow roasting pan, mixing well so that meat
is completely coated. Marinate in refrigerator for several hours.
Take out of refrigerator and let sit out about 20 minutes to come to
room temperature. Before cooking, add tomatoes to marinade and mix
well to coat with juices. Place meat cubes on skewers, alternating
with green pepper slices, onion slices, and tomato wedges. Lay
skewers in pan with marinade, turning several times. Put skewered
lamb on a rack over pan containing marinade and place under preheated
broiler. Turn several times during cooking and baste with marinade
from pan.  Cooking time depends on your taste; for medium rare allow
about 15-18 minutes. Serve skewers on plates with rice pilaf.

Alternatively you can barbecue lamb using marinade as the basting
sauce. This is always the way we cook this dish--rain or shine. Check
doneness of lamb at about 10 minutes and if not done to your liking,
cook further until cooked through.

2 tablespoon minced parsley
1 teaspoon dried basil or mint
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1  salt and pepper to taste
3  eggs
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
1  chicken or beef stock
1/4 cup lemon juice

Cooked rice Minced parsley

Put meat into a bowl with onion, garlic, uncooked rice, herbs, salt
and pepper.  Beat two of the egg whites until they froth and add them
as well.

Reserve yolks and the other egg for the sauce.  Gently mix with a
fork or your hands, and form walnut-size balls. Fry meatballs in
vegetable oil over low heat. When lightly brown, remove with a
slotted spoon to a saucepan. Add enough stock to cover meatballs, and
simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes.

Pour off stock through a sieve, and measure it.  You will need 1 1/2
cups for the sauce. To make the sauce, beat reserved egg yolks and
the whole egg together until quite frothy. Whisk in lemon juice bit
by bit, then whisk in hot stock bit by bit, beating steadily. Pour
over meatballs, and cook, stirring, over low heat until sauce
thickens. Do not let it come to a boil, or it will separate. Serve on
a bed of rice, sprinkled with parsley.

Haggis #3

lamb, scottish

1  sheep's stomach, thoroughly cleaned
1  the liver, heart, and lights (lungs; ) of the sheep
1 pound beef suet
2 large onions
2 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne or red pepper
1/2 teaspoon allspice
2 pound dry oatmeal (the old-fashioned, slo; w-cooking kind)
2  or 3 cups broth (in which the liver; , heart and lights were
1  cooked)
1  utensils
4 quart pot with lid

What you need: Canning kettle or a large spaghetti pot, 16- to 20
quart size with a lid to fit it Meat grinder Cheesecloth What to do:
If the butcher has not already cut apart and trimmed the heart, liver
and lungs, do that first.  It involves cutting the lungs off the
windpipe, cutting the heart off the large bloodvessels and cutting it
open to rinse it, so that it can cook more quickly. The liver, too,
has to be freed from the rest. Put them in a 4-quart pot with 2 to 3
cups water, bring to a boil, and simmer for about an hour and a half.
Let it all cool, and keep the broth. Run the liver and heart through
the meat grinder. Take the lungs and cut out as much of the gristly
part as you easily can, then run them through the grinder, too. Next,
put the raw beef suet through the grinder. As you finish grinding
each thing, put it in the big kettle. Peel, slice and chop the
onions, then add them to the meat in the kettle. Add the salt and
spices and mix. The oatmeal comes next, and while it is customary to
toast it or brown it very lightly in the oven or in a heavy bottomed
pan on top of the stove, this is not absolutely necessary. When the
oatmeal has been thoroughly mixed with the rest of it, add the 2 cups
of the broth left from boiling the meat. See if when you take a
handful, it sticks together. If it does, do not add the third cup of
broth. If it is still crumbly and will not hold together very well,
add the rest of the broth and mix thoroughly. Have the stomach smooth
side out and stuff it with the mixture, about three-quarters full.
Sew up the openings. Wrap it in cheesecloth,so that when it is cooked
you can handle it. Now, wash out the kettle and bring about 2 gallons
of water to a boil in it. Put in the haggis and prick it all over
with a skewer so that it does not burst. You will want to do this a
couple of times early in the cooking span. Boil the haggis gently for
about 4 or 5 hours. If you did not have any cheesecloth for wrapping
the haggis, you can use a large clean dishtowel. Work it under with
kitchen spoons to make a sling with which you can lift out the haggis
in one piece. You will probably want to wear lined rubber gloves to
protect your hands from the hot water while you lift it out with the
wet cloth. (You put the dish cloth in the pot only after the haggis
is done; you do not cook the towel with the haggis as you would the
cheesecloth.) Note: Even if the butcher has cleaned the stomach, you
will probably want to go over it again. Turn the stomach shaggy side
out and rinse. Rub it in a sinkful of cold water. Change the water
and repeat as many times as necessary, until the water stays pretty
clear and handling it does not produce much sediment as the water
drains out of the sink.

Hanoi Beef & Rice-Noodel Soup (Pho Bac)

beef, vietnamese

5 pound oxtails
2 pound short rib plate, or 1 pound flank s; k
2 large onions, unpeeled, halved and studde; d with 8 whole cloves
3  shallots, unpeeled
2 ounce fresh ginger root, unpeeled in one; piece
8  star anise
1  cinnamon stick
4 medium parsnips, cut into 2-inch chunks
2 teaspoon salt
1 pound beef sirloin
2  scallions, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon shredded coriander
2 medium onions, sliced paper-thin
1/4 cup hot chili sauce (tuong ot or srirac; ha sauce)
1 pound 1/4-inch-wide dried rice sticks (ba; nh pho)
1/2 cup nuoc mam (vietnamese fish sauce)
1  freshly ground black pepper
      ----ACCOMPANIMENTS----
2 cup fresh bean sprouts
2  fresh red chile peppers, sliced
2  limes, cut into wedges
1 bunch of fresh mint, separated into leave; s
1 bunch fresh asian basil *
1  * or regular fresh basil, separated; into leaves

"This sublime recipe comes from my mother, a native of Hanoi. She
always made the beef stock in large quantities++enough for at least 3
meals++and froze it in batches until needed."

In order to cut the beef into paper-thin slices, freeze the pieces of
meat for 30 minutes before slicing.

The night before, clean the bones under cold running water and soak
overnight in a pot with water to cover at room temperature. (This
will help loosen the impurities inside the bones. When heat is
applied, these impurities are released and come to the top much
faster and can be removed, therefore, producing a clear broth.)

Place the beef bones, oxtails and short rib plate in a large
stockpot. Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Cook for 10
minutes. Drain. Rinse the pot and the bones.

Return the bones to the pot and add 6 quarts of water. Bring to a
boil. Skim the surface to remove the foam and fat. Stir the bones in
the bottom of the pot from time to time to free the impurities.
Continue skimming until the foam ceases to rise.  Add 3 quarts more
water and bring to a boil.  Skim off all the residue that forms on
the top. Turn the heat to low and simmer.

Meanwhile, char the clove-studded onions, shallots and ginger
directly over a gas burner or under the broiler until they release
their fragrant odors. Tie the charred vegetables, star anise and
cinnamon stick in a double thickness of dampened cheesecloth.  Add
the spice bag, parsnips and salt to the simmering broth. Simmer for 1
hour.

Remove the short rib plates.  Pull the meat away from the bones.
Reserve the meat and return the bones to the pot. Simmer the broth,
uncovered, for 4 to 5 hours. Keep an eye on it; as the liquid boils
away, add enough fresh water to cover the bones.

Meanwhile, slice the beef sirloin against the grain into paper-thin
slices, roughly 2 by 2-inches in size. Slice the reserved short rib
meat paper-thin.  Set aside.

In a small bowl, combine the scallions, coriander and half of the
slice onions.  Place the remaining sliced onions in a small bowl and
stir in the hot chili sauce. Blend well.

Soak the rice sticks in warm water for 30 minutes. Drain and set
aside.

When the broth is ready, remove and discard all of the bones. Strain
the broth through a strainer or colander lined with a double layer of
dampened cheesecloth into a clean pot. Add the fish sauce and bring
the broth to a boil.  Reduce the heat and keep the broth at a bare
simmer. In another pot, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil. Drain the
noodles, then drop them in the boiling water. Drain immediately.
Divide the noodles among 4 large soup bowls.  Top the noodles with
the sliced meats. bring the broth to a rolling boil.  Ladle the broth
directly over the meat in each bowl (the boiling broth will cook the
raw beef instantly). Garnish with the scallion mixture and freshly
ground black pepper. Serve the onions in hot chili sauce and the
accompaniments on the side. Each diner will add these ingredients as
desired. Yield: 4 servings.

Headcheese

ethnic, makemeat

4 1/2 pound fresh pigs feet
2 pound fresh pigs heart
1 pound fresh pigs tongue
4 quart water
1/4 cup + 2 ts. salt
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
1/4 cup strained fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoon butter
1 cup finely chopped onions
1 medium bay leaf, finely crumbled
1 teaspoon ground sage
1/4 teaspoon ground mace
1/2 teaspoon cayenne
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 cup finely chopped fresh parsley
1 cup finely chopped scallions,
1  including 3 of green tops

Note: On the farms of South Louisianna, this savor jellied meat is made
from the head of a hog.  The following recipe uses instead fresh pigs feet,
tongue and heart, because these ingredietns are more readily available from
most retail butchers.

Place the pigs feet, heart and tongue in an 8-10 qt. enameled or stainless
steel pot and add the water, 1/4 c. of the salt, the vinegar and 1
tablespoon. of
the lemon juice.  Bring to a boil over high heat, meanwhile skimming off
the foam and scum as they rise to the surface. Then reduce the heat to low,
cover partially, and simmer for about 4 hours, or until all the meats are
tender and show no resistance when pierced deeply with the point of a sharp
knife.

With tongs, transfer the tongue, feet and heart to a cutting board. Measure
and reserve 3 1/2 c. of the cooking liquid.  While it is still warm, skin
the tongue with a small sharp knife, cutting away the fat, bones and
bristle at its base.  Cut or pull off the meat from the pigs feet and
discard the bones, skin, gristle and fat. Slice the pigs heart lengthwise
into quarters and cut away the arteries and veins and any pieces of fat.
Cut all the meats into small chunks and put them through the coarsest
bladeof a food grinder. There should be about 5 1/2 c. of ground meat.

In a heavy 12" skillet, melt the butter over moderate heat.  Add the onions
and, stirring frequently, cook for about 5 minutes, or until they are soft
and translucent but not brown.

Pour in 1/2 c. of the reserved cooking liquid and, stirring from time to
time, simmer over low heat for 15-20 minutes, until almost all of the
liquid has evaporated.

Stir in the ground meat, the remaining 3 c. of cooking liquid, 3
tablespoon. of
lemon juice and 2 ts. of salt.  Add the bay leaf, sage, mace and red and
black pepper, and bring to a boil over medium heat.  Reduce the heat to low
and simmer, partially covered, for 10 minutes longer.

Remove the skillet from the heat, stir in the parsley and scallions, and
taste for seasoning.  With a rubber spatula, transfer the entire contents
of the skillet to a 9x9x2 baking dish and smooth the top with the spatula.
Cool to room temperature, then cover with foil or plastic wrap and
refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until the headcheese is thoroughly
chilled and firm to the touch.

To unmold and serve the headcheese, run a thin-bladed knife around the
edges of the dish to loosen the sides and dip the bottom briefly into hot
water.  Place an inverted platter on top of the dish and, grasping the
platter and dish together firmly, tun them over.  The headcheese should
slide out of the dish easily.

Slice the headcheese thin and serve it with crackers or toast.

Hearty Brisket From "The Only Texas Cookbook"

meats, beef, brisket

8 pound brisket (8 to 10 pound)
1/4 cup dry red wine
1 tablespoon molasses
1/4 cup soy sauce
1 teaspoon peppercorns
1 tablespoon salt
5  cloves garlic, minced
2  onions, minced fine
2  stalks celery, minced fine
1  pepper, coarsely ground

Make a marinade of wine, molasses, soy sauce, peppercorns, salt
garlic, onions, and celery. (You can put onions and celery in
processor until almost pureed.) Lay the boned and trimmed brisket on
a large piece of heavy- duty foil and spread the marinade over all
surfaces. Wrap the brisket tightly. Place in refrigerator and
marinate for 24 hours. Open foil and sprinkle the brisket generously
with freshly milled pepper. Reseal, place in a large open roasting
pan (or jelly roll pan). Place in a 200-deg oven and cook for 8
hours. Remove from oven. Rewrap the meat in a clean sheet of foil.
Reserve pan juices and serve with warm meat. Good hot or cold on
sandwiches. Serves 20 ...............................................
Cooking a brisket recalls an elementary law of physics. What happens
to water at 212-deg? It boils away. By cooking a brisket at 200-deg.
all the inherent juices are saved and the meat is made more tender
than you ever imagined. It is important that the cooking sack be
completely sealed--a good method is to use what is called a drugstore
wrap. Here's what you do. You'll probably notice that a brisket is
too wide to seal in one width of foil, so you will need to seal 4
sides. Here's how: Tear off 2 large equal lengths of foil. Lay 1 on
top of the other. Now fold 1 side over twice, making a narrow
1/2-inch double fold. Open out the 2 sheets, and you'll have a good
seal on the bottom. Lay the meat on top of the seam. Coat all
surfaces with the marinade. Now life the 2 remaining sides of foil up
and, holding them even with each other, fold over and over in
1/2-inch folds until you have a tight package. Press fold flat
against the meat. This is what should be touching all surfaces of the
meat snugly. You just have to be careful not to puncture it during
the cooking and handling process. When I cook this brisket, I do the
whole thin after supper. The first night I make the marinade and
place meat in the refrigerator; the next night I put it in the oven
just before going to bed. By morning it is cooked to a turn. A good
working woman's scheme. You can eat this for several days without
screaming.

Hidatsa Stuffed Sugar Pumpkin

meats, vegetables, misc, native american

      ----SPIRIT OF THE HARVEST----
1  sugar pumpkin, 4-5 pounds
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
2 tablespoon rendered fat
1 pound ground buffalo, venison or beef
1  medium onion, chopped
1 cup cooked wild rice
3  eggs, beaten
1 teaspoon crushed, dried sage
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Preheat oven to 350 deg F. Cut the top off the pumpkin and remove strings
and seeds. Reserve seeds for another use. Prick the cavity with a fork and
rub with 1 teaspoon salt and the mustard. Heat fat in a large skillet, add
meat and onion and saute over medium-high heat until browned. Off the heat,
stir in wild rice, eggs, remaining salt, sage and pepper. Stuff pumpkin
with the meat mixture. Place 1/2" water in the bottom of a shallow baking
pan. Put pumpkin in the pan and bake for 1 1/2 hours, or until tender. Add
more water to the pan as neccessary to avoid sticking. To serve, cut
pumpkin into wedges, giving each person pumpkin and stuffing.

Art's notes: I've not tried either of these, since at the time pumpkin was
not available in this area. I have however, used a Columbian Squash
(resembled pumpkin in appearance and texture of meat) as a substitute.

Honey-Orange Lamb

meats

1/4 cup soy sauce
3/4 cup pinot noir (burgundy)
1/4 cup orange juice (juice of 1 orange)
2 tablespoon lemon juice (juice of 1 lemon)
2 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon mustard, dry
1 cup tomato puree (puree of 1 tomato)
3  garlic cloves (or more to taste)
1/4 teaspoon black pepper, ground
1  half leg of lamb, butterflied

Mix together all of the ingredients except the lamb.  Place the lamb in a
bowl or pan that will not be corroded by the marinade (a glass 9x13 pan
works well). Pour the marinade over the lamb. Cover and marinate in the
refrigerator for 12 hours, turning occasionally.

Start a fire in the grill and get the coals very warm but not flaming.
Place lamb on grill about 3-4 inches from the coals. Cook 20 minutes on
each side.

After 10 minutes on the second side, start checking for doneness. Contrary
to many people's ideas, lamb should not be well done but should still be a
little pink. When done, slice thin and serve.

NOTES:

*  Grilled butterflied leg of lamb -- This recipe is the same as Anita
Cochran's recipe for grilled butterflied leg of lamb, except that it uses a
different marinade.  I got the marinade recipe from a local wine merchant.
Yield:  Serves 4-6.

*  This marinade also works well with chicken.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  5 minutes preparation, overnight marinating, 40 minutes cooking.
: Precision:  no need to measure.

Hot-And-Spicy Short Ribs

meats

3 pound beef short ribs *
1  *cut in 1-in lengths
4  garlic cloves  peeled and minced
2  1-in cubes ginger  peeled and mince; d
3 medium scallions; trimmed & minced
2/3 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoon sesame oil
1 1/2 teaspoon spicy sesame oil
1 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon cider vinegar
1 tablespoon mirin (sweet rice wine)
1/4 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds

TOAST THE SESAME SEEDS by spreading them over the bottom of a pie tin.
Roast them at 300F for 12-to-16 minutes. Stir sesame seeds often,
until they are golden. With a very sharp knife, score the meat on
each short rib in a crisscross pattern, making the cuts about
3/8-inch apart and cutting almost to the bone. This will allow the
marinade to penetrate and help tenderize the meat. Place the short
ribs in a large shallow baking pan. Combine the rest of the
ingredients, pour the marinade over the meat and toss well to mix.
Cover and refrigerate the ribs for 24 hours, turning them in the
marinade several times. When you are ready to cook the short ribs,
preheat the oven to 325F. Arrange the ribs on a rack in a shallow
roasting pan. Brush ribs with a little of the marinade. Roast them
uncovered for 20 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven, turn the ribs
and brush them with the marinade. Raise the oven temperature to 500F.
After the ribs have stood for 10 minutes at room temperature, return
them to the oven and roast them for 5 minutes. Turn them again, baste
them lavishly with the marinade and roast them for 3 to 5 minutes
longer for rare, about 8 minutes for medium-rare. Brush the ribs with
any remaining marinade and serve them with fluffy boiled rice and a
crisp salad. Makes 4 to 6 Servings

Jack-In-The-Box Jumbo Jack

main dish, meats

1  sesame seed hamburger bun
3/16 pound ground beef (3.2 ounce)
1 dash salt
2 teaspoon mayonaise
2  tomato slices
1 large lettuce leaf
2  dill pickle slices
1 tablespoon chopped onion

1) Preheat a frying pan over medium. heat. 2) Lightly toast both halves
of bun, face down and set aside. 3) Form ground beef into thin patty
(use hamburger press) slightly larger than the bun. 4) Cook patty in
hot pan for 2 to 3 min per side. Lightly salt. 5) Build burger in the
following stacking order from bottom up: bottom bun--half of
mayo--beef patty--tomatoes--lettuce leaf--pickles--onion-- remainder
of mayo--top bun.

Yield: 1 hamburger

If you want to make a cheeseburger, slice of American cheese should
go on top of beef patty.

In 1950 a man named Robert O'Petersen built the first Jack-In-The-Box
restaurant at El Cahon and 63rd streets in San Diego. The restaurant
was origanally built for drive-thru and walk-up service
only--customers would speak into a clown's mouth to order their food.
The clown was blasted to smithereens with explosives in a 1980
advertising campaign, however, signifying a shift toward a more
diverse adult menu.
The Jumbo Jack hamburger has been on the menu since 1974.

Jack-In-The-Box Taco

main dish, meats, mexican

1 pound ground beef
1/3 cup refried beans
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon chili powder
1/4 cup ortega taco sauce
12  soft corn tortillas
3 cup cooking oil(crisco prefer'd)
6 slice American cheese
1  head lettuce, chopped fine

1) Slowly brown ground beef over low heat, using wooden spoon to chop
and stir meat, keeping it very fine and smooth. 2) When beef is
browned, drain fat. 3) Add refried beans and use wooden spoon to
smash the whole beans into the mixture, creating a smooth texture. 4)
Add the salt, chili powder, and 2 tbs. of the taco sauce to the
mixture. Remove from heat. 5) In another skillet, heat 1/4" of oil
until hot. (Test with small pc. of tortilla--it should bubble when
dropped into the oil.) Crisco oil will give the food a taste closest
to the original. 6) Spread 1/12 th of beef mixture on center of each
tortilla. 7) Fold tortillas over and press so that the beef filling
acts as an adhesive and holds sides together. 8) Drop each taco into
the pan of hot oil and fry on both sides until crispy. 9) When
cooked, remove the tacos from the oil and place them on a rack or
some paper towels until they are a little cooler. 10) Pry open each
taco slightly. Add 1/2 slice of American cheese (cut diagonally) and
some lettuce. Top with abt. 1 1/2 teaspoon. of remaining taco sauce.

Yield: Makes 12 Tacos

Older than McDonald's and Burger King, Jack-in-the-Box, is the
world's 5th largest hamburger chain, with 1,089 outlets (by the end
of 1991) in 13 states throughout the West and Southwest. The
restaurant, headquartered in San Diego, boasts one of the largest
menus in the fast-food world--a whopping
45    items.
Now taste for yourself the homemade version of Jack's most
popular item. The Jack-in-the-Box Taco has been served since the
inception of the chain, with very few changes over the years.

Jerky - Water/Smoker Method

beef

1 1/2 pound beef flank steak
1/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 cup non-iodized salt
2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon ginger

Fire up your smoker and start settling the coals in for a long slow
smoke before starting the rub.

Pat the meat dry with a paper towel and slice it, with the blade of
the knife 30 degrees to the horizontal, across the grain, creating
strips 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.

In a small mixing bowl, blend together the sugar, salt, paprika,
garlic powder, pepper and ginger.  Rub this mixture into the meat,
putting the spiced strips on the grill, but don't fill the water pan.
Give the jerky 3 to 5 hours of smoke at 130 to 180 degrees F.
propping the lid open a crack if the temperature threatens to rise
disastrously beyond the desired range.

When the strips are chewy-crisp, remove them from the heat, let cool,
and store individually in plastic wrap. Refrigerate to store longer
than a few days.

Meatloaf - Fourth Prize Preheat oven to 350F. Mush first 14
ingredients together by hand until well mixed and put into a bread
pan. Stick knife in three places so meatloaf cooks evenly. Bake for
30 minutes. Increase heat to 400F for 20 minutes. Remove from oven
and drain juice from pan. Sprinkle all the Monterey jack cheese
evenly over the top of the meatloaf and return to oven for 15 to 20
minutes or until the cheese starts to bubble. Watch carefully so
cheese doesn't burn. The meatloaf will have shrunk enough so that the
cheese melted over all sides gives a frosted effect.

Jumbo Ravioli

meats, pasta, italian, sauces

1/2 cup fresh basil leaves
2 large eggs
2 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cup all-purpose flour, unsifted
1  veal filling:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound ground veal
1 small onion, chopped
1  clove garlic, minced
2 large eggs
1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
2 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped
1  quick tomato sauce:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
1  clove garlic, minced
1 can tomato puree (1 pound, 13 ounce)
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon sugar (optional)
1 teaspoon dried oregano leaves
1/2 teaspoon dried basil leaves
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon olive oil

BASIL PASTA DOUGH:

Parmesan cheese, grated

Pasta Dough:  In food processor (or blender), puree basil, eggs, oil,
and salt.  (If using blender, pour into bowl; stir in enough flour to
make stiff dough.) Add 1 1/2 cups flour to processor; process for 5
seconds. With motor running, add enough flour so dough forms a ball.
Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface, and knead for a few
minutes until smooth and elastic, adding flour as necessary.  If
dough was not mixed in food processor, knead for about 5 minutes. Cut
dough in half and shape into balls.  Cover dough with inverted bowl;
rest for 1/2 hour.

Veal Filling:  Heat oil in skillet; add veal, onion, and garlic. Saute
until veal is cooked and moisture has evaporated, about 5 minutes.
Remove from heat; cool slightly. In food processor, process meat to a
paste. Mix in eggs, cheese, and parsley; cool.

Tomato Sauce:  Heat Oil in skillet or large saucepan over medium heat.
Saute onion and garlic until onion is translucent. Stir in tomato
puree and remaining sauce ingredients. Simmer, uncovered, for 15
minutes. Cover; keep warm until ready to use.

Ravioli:  On floured surface, roll half of dough into a 12-by-16 inch
rectangle; set aside on a towel.  Roll other half; score into 12 (4-
inch) squares.  Mound filling in center of squares. Brush water on
scored lines; lay other rectangle of pasta on top.  Press, with
fingers, around filling to seal.  Use pastry wheel or knife to cut
between the mounds. In a large saucepan, bring 2 quarts water and 1
tablespoon oil to a boil. Add ravioli; cook gently for 5 to 7
minutes, or until edges are tender. Remove with slotted utensil
(spoon or spatula). Serve with tomato sauce and cheese.

Kangaroo Escalopes With Spinach & Anchovy B

meats

600 gm kangaroo fillet, trimmed
2 bunch of english spinach
12  anchovy fillets
200 gm unsalted butter
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon black pepper freshly ground
1 teaspoon sea salt
1  olive oil

"Most people won't have ever tasted kangaroo. It is a
sweet, strong-tasting meat, it's texture and taste
described as somwe- here between venison and
liver...To eat kangaroo, you have to like game; you
have to like offal and you have to be a red meat
eater...It's a very big, very strong-tasting meat."

These recipes are by Chris Manfield from The Paragon
Cafe, Circular Quay.

Slice the kangaroo fillet into thin slices, three per
serve. Brush with olive oil and sprinkle lightly with
black pepper. Remove stalks from spinach and wash
leaves thoroughly. Plunge into rapidly boiling water
for 30 seconds. Strain and immerse immediately in iced
water to stop the cooking process and main- tain the
green colour. When cold, remove leaves from water and
squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Refrigerate
until ready to use.

Soften 100 g unsalted butter and blend in food
processor with the anchovies, lemon juice and a pinch
of sea salt and pepper until smooth. Scrape out onto a
piece of foil and form into a sausage shape.
Refrigerate until firm Heat a large, heavy- base,
cast-iron fry pan or grill plate until hot. Toss in
the oiled meat slices and quickly sear on each side.
Do not turn until the first side is properly
sealed--this does not take very long--and don't
overcook. Remove meat and rest in a warm place until
all the meat slices are cooked. In another pan, over
medium heat, melt the remaining butter, add the
squeezed spinach and the salt and pepper, and stir
until the spinach is hot. Divide the spinach into four
portions, spoon onto the centre of the plate, top with
three escalopes. Slice the anchovy butter so it begins
to melt over the hot meat. Serve immediately.

Kay's Favorite Meat Loaf

main dish, meats, diabetic

1  beef bouillion
1/2 cup boiling water
2 slice bread; crumbled fine
1 1/2 pound 85% lean ground beef
2 medium eggs; beaten slightly
1/2 cup onion; chopped finely
1/4 cup celery; chopped finely
2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon catup

Preheat oven to 350 f degree.  Line a shallow 8-inch baking pan with foil.
Dissolve beef bouillion cube in boiling water in a large bowl. Add all
other ingrediets except the catsup and blend well with a fork. Turn onto
foil in pan and, with hands, shape quickly into a 6 by 4 1/2 inch by 2 inch
loaf.  With the dull edge of a knife make a crisscross pattern across the
top, spread with catup across the top. Cover loaf with a tent of foil that
does not touch the top. Bake 45 minutes. Remove foil; bake, uncovered,
another 45 minutes.  Remove from oven and cool in pan for 2-3 minutes
before serving.  Using this molded metheod instead of loaf pan allows the
fat to drain from the loaf, whereas a loaf pan retains fat.

Kefallinian Spicy Meat Pie

meats, greek

1  karen mintzias
1 small leg of lamb  boned, cut into 1 piec; es,  bones reserved
1  lemon (juice only)
1/4 cup oil or butter
1  onion; chopped
3 medium potatoes; parboiled in their  jacke
1 large carrot; parboiled, diced
3 cup parboiled white rice; drained
2 tablespoon tomato puree
1 cup feta cheese, crumbled
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
2  sprigs fresh mint; chopped
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1  garlic clove; sliced
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1  orange or lemon peel  cut into piec; es
1  salt and freshly ground pepper
16  commercial filo sheets
6 tablespoon butter (or more); melted
3  hard-boiled eggs; quartered

On the island of Kefallinia in the Ionion Sea, the
Feast Day of Analipseos (Ascension Day) is celebrated
with the traditional "kreatopita" (meat-pie). This
spicy pie also ushers in the beginning of Lent on the
day of Apokreas.

In a stock pot, cover the lamb bones with cold water.
Simmer, covered for 1 hour. Strain, boil down to 1
cup, and set aside. Sprinkle the lemon juice on the
lamb cubes. Heat the oil or butter in a heavy pan, add
the onions and lamb, and saute the meat on all sides
until the onions are soft without browning. Pour the
onions, lamb, and juices into a large bowl. Add the
diced potatoes and carrot, rice, tomato puree, cheese,
parsley, mint, oregano, garlic, cinnamon, and fruit
peel and season with salt and freshly ground pepper.
Add enough reserved lamb broth for liquid while pie
bakes, then mix with a wooden spoon.

Butter the bottom and sides of a 9 x 12 x 3 inch pan.
Spread 8 filo sheets, brushing the melted butter in
between the sheets, making sure the pastry fits the
sides and bottom of the pan. Pour in the filling,
spreading evenly with a spatula. Place the egg
quarters here and there across the top and cover with
the remaining filo sheets, brushing with butter as
before. Flute the edges with two fingers or a fork and
brush the top with butter. Using a sharp knife, score
the top 3 filo sheets into square or diamond shapes,
or prick the homemade pastry with a fork. Bake for 40
to 50 minutes in moderately slow oven (325 F), raising
the temperature to 350 F during the last 10 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let stand on a rack for 15
minutes. Remove from the oven and let stand on a rack
for 15 minutes. Cut into diamonds or squares and serve
warm.

Kibbee Bissaneeyeh - Lamb W/Wheat~ Baked W/St

main dish, meats, ethnic, lamb

      ----STUFFING----
2 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound coarsely ground lamb
2 tablespoon pine nuts
1 large onion; finely chopped
1  salt to taste
1  ground allspice; to taste
      ----KIBBEE----
1 1/2 cup fine bulgur
2 pound ground lamb; finely ground
1/4 cup cold water
2  medium onion; grated
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1 pinch nutmeg; grated, pinch
1 pinch cayenne pepper (optional)
3 tablespoon butter; room temperature

Preheat the oven to 375F. Make the stuffing. Heat the
oil in a saucepan and add the coarsely ground lamb,
the pine nuts, onion, salt, and allspice. Cook,
stirring, until browned. Set aside to cool as you make
the kibbee base. Make the kibbee. Soak the bulgur in
water to cover for 10 minutes or until softened. Drain
well. Add the finely ground lamb, cold water, and
onions and knead the mixture well. Keep moistening
your hands so the mixture does not stick to them.
Knead in the spices. Some like a thick kibbee, some a
flatter one. About 1 1/2 inches is a good height.
Depending on the height you want, butter a round or
rectuangular baking pan with 1 Tbl of the butter.
(About 10 inches in diameter is fine for 1 1/2-inch
high kibbee.) With wet hands, press half the kibbee
mixture into the pan, patting it level. Spread the
stuffing evenly over the base. Cover with the rest of
the kibbee mixture and pat with moistened hands. With
a knife dipped in cold water, cut a diamond pattern
through the layers. Dot with the remaining butter.
Bake for 10 minutes, then lower the heat to 325F. Bake
for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until browned and
bubbling. Do not overcook. Serve hot with yogurt and
salad. Instead of making if one big fat kibbee, I like
to make "meatballs." I take about 2 Tbl of meat
mixture and flatten in the palm of my hand. Then I
take about 1-2 teaspoon of filling and put that in the
middle of the meat. Then I take another 2 Tbl of meat
mixture, flatten and place over the meat with the
filling. Shape into oval-shaped meatballs. Bake the
same way as above.

Koettbullar (Swedish Meatballs)

appetizers, meats, beef, hamburger, swedish

1/2 cup unseasoned bread crumbs
1/2 cup half and half cream
4 tablespoon unsalted butter
1/4 cup minced white onions
1/3 pound ground beef
1/3 pound ground veal
1/3 pound ground pork
1 large egg
1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1.  Soak the bread crumbs in the half and half for 5
minutes in a large mixing bowl.

2.  Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small skillet
over low to moderate heat. When the foam starts to
subside, add the onions and saute them for about 2
minutes. Let cool slightly.

3.  Add the beef, veal, pork, egg nutmeg, salt,
pepper, and onions to the bread-crumb mixture. Gently
combine the ingredients with your hands.

4.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate the mixture for a
couple of hours.

5.  Shape the meat mixture with your hands into
uniform 2/3-inch balls. Arrange them on a plate in one
layer so they do not touch each other. Let the
meatballs stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.

6.  Melt the remaining butter in a saute pan or
skillet over moderate heat. When the foam starts to
subside, add the meatballs. (Do not crowd the pan;
unless your pan is oversized, you will have to cook
gthe meatballs in batches and keep the cooked ones
warm in a preheated 200 degree F oven.) Saute the
meatballs for about 5 minutes until they become brown
on all sides. Turn them as necessary, but do so gently.

7.  Transfer the 'koettbullar' to a warm platter and
serve immediately.

Kosher Salami

makemeat

8 pound lean boneless beef chuck, cubed
2 pound beef fat, cubed
5 tablespoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon finely minced garlic
1 tablespoon finely ground white pepper
1 1/2 teaspoon coarsely crushed white peppr
1 tablespoon coarse grind coriander seed
1 1/2 tablespoon sugar
1 cup dry white wine
1/2 teaspoon ascorbic acid
1 teaspoon saltpeter
4  feet large beef casings

"This recipe makes real kosher salami if you have access to
kosher-butchered beef. If not, then just like kosher dill pickles, it's the
flavor that counts."

Grind the beef through the fine disk. Grind the ft through the coarse disk.
Mix the dry ingredients with the wine and pour this mixture over the meat
and fat. Mix well. Spread in pan and cure in the refrigerator 24-48 hours.
Prepare casings, stuff and tie off into 8-9" links. Hang to dry for one
week. Wipe the sausage dry and smoke over a cool (120) smoke about 8 hours.
Increase smoking temperature to 150-160 and smoke for an additional four
hours. Because the smoking aids in the drying process, the salami should be
ready to eat after about three weeks of additional drying.

tomatoes, and parsley and season with salt and pepper.
Cover the pan and simmer for 30 minutes, adding the
coriander and oregano during the last 10 minutes.

Spread the filling over the filo evenly, then top with
the remaining filo sheets, buttering each as before.

Kurt's Taco/Burrito Meat

meats, tex mex

1 each chorizo link; sliced 1/4 (mexican sausa
1/2 medium red onion; diced
1/4 cup bell pepper; diced
1 each celery stalk; diced
2 each garlic cloves; fine chopped
1 1/2 pound extra lean ground beef =or=
1 1/2 pound ground turkey
2 tablespoon to 3 masa harina
1 1/2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoon canned green chiles; diced
1 teaspoon mexican oregano; crushed
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary; crushed
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme; crushed
3 tablespoon chili powder; or to taste
1 tablespoon paprika; or to taste
2 teaspoon cumin; or to taste
1 single salt and pepper to taste
1 single Tabasco or other hot sauce to taste

Place sliced chorizo in cold heavy skillet; turn on
flame to lowest setting. The idea is to render the fat
from the chorizo before cooking it.

Meanwhile, prepare the onion, bell pepper, celery and
garlic.

After the chorizo has sizzled and released it's fat
(about 10 minutes) use a spatula to break it into
small bits.  Turn up the heat and add the onion,
celery, and green pepper; saute for 8 minutes. Add the
garlic and saute for another 2 minutes.

Drain fat from the mixture by placing on a paper towel
on top of a brown paper bag or newspaper.

In the same skillet, brown the ground beef or turkey.
Crumble the meat. (A potato masher works great.)

When browned, drain off most of the fat.  (Tilt the
skillet and use a baister to suck it out.)  Stir the
masa in to absorb the remaining juices.

Add the chorizo mix, green chiles, W. sauce and
remaining spices. Let it cook on the lowest heat for
another 30 minutes, stirring every
10    minutes to prevent stickage.

NOTES: * If you cannot find chorizo, a workable
substitute is:
1/2 pound Ground pork
1 1/2 ts White vinegar
1 ts Paprika
1 tb Chili powder
1/2 ts Oregano
1 ea Garlic clove; minced
1/2 ts salt
1 ds cayenne

Mix ingredients and let the flavors blend in fridge
for a day.

~ All measurements are approximate; I cook by feel. ~
The vegies saute'd with the chorizo =really= makes a
difference. ~ Ground turkey -vs- beef: either works
great, as long as it's lean. ~ Use flour instead of
masa harina if not available. ~ The end result should
=not= be greasy/drippy! ~ Substitute fresh Anaheim or
California chiles for the canned
chiles. If doing so (recommended), saute' along with
other veggies
in the chorizo.

1/8 teaspoon fresh lime juice, approximately
1  sea salt
1  freshly ground pepper

Place the beef between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound, pushing
it outward as you go, to a rough oval shape. Fold into a package and
pound out again to the required size. Peel off the top plastic wrap
and replace with wax paper.  Turn meat over and replace second sheet
of plastic with wax paper; set aside until ready to use.

Heat a griddle.  When very hot, grease lightly. Remove top paper.
Sprinkle the exposed side of the meat with lime juice and salt and
pepper and lay it face down, with the aid of the paper, on the
griddle. Strip off the bottom paper.  Cook for about 2 seconds, flip
the meat over with two spatulas so it will not break in the middle,
and cook for 2 seconds more. Serve immediately, flat if possible, on
a large plate with refried beans, and fresh salsa of your choice.

Laab Nuea (Ground Beef Salad)

salads, beef, thai

1 pound ground beef
1/4 cup lime juice
2 tablespoon fish sauce (nam pla)     **
1/2 teaspoon galangal powder(kha pon) **
6  shallots, thinly sliced
2 tablespoon scallion (spring onion),  chopped
2 tablespoon cilantro leaves, chopped
2 tablespoon ground roasted sticky rice**
1 teaspoon thai red chili pepper,  ground (pri; k khee no pon)
15  mint leaves

Description:
The blend of fresh herbs and lime juice makes this salad very
refreshing. This laab recipe was taken to Bangkok by the people of
the Northeast and is one of the favorite dishes of Thailand. Other
meats such as chicken or pork can also be used.

Directions:
Combine the ground beef with the lime juice, fish sauce, galangal
powder and shallots.
Heat a skillet and cook the ground beef mixture on medium-high heat
for 5 minutes or until the beef is cooked.
Remove the skillet from the heat and add the chopped green onion and
cilantro and the ground roasted rice. Mix thoroughly so that
everything is well combined.
Remove to a serving plate, spoon the ground pepper on the side of
the plate if desired, and garnish with the mint leaves.
Serve with an accompaniment of raw vegetables, such as long string
beans or snake beans, sliced cabbage, green leaf lettuce/Chinese
lettuce, basil leaves, and swamp cabbage or spinach.

** TERMS
Roasted sticky rice: Prepared by adding raw sticky rice to a hot
skillet and cooking until it is golden brown. Add a tablespoon of
water to the pan at occasional intervals. Grind in a mortar with a
pestle if ground roasted sticky rice is needed.
Galangal (kha): A relative of the ginger root, galangal is pale
yellow and has a unique, delicate flavor. Fresh young ginger root,
but not dried ginger, is an adequate substitute, but does not
properly replace the unique flavor.
Fish sauce (nam pla): A salty, pale brown liquid used widely in Thai
cooking, this is made from fermented small fish or shrimp. The fish
are salted and fermented in jars and then the liquid is collected. It
adds salt to many dishes and is essential for authentic Thai
flavors--and is available from Asian food stores.

1  karen mintzias
1  rabbit or hare - cleaned and skinne; d
2  celery stalks, with leaves, - chopp; ed
2 medium onions; chopped
1  carrot; sliced
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
1  bay leaf; crumbled
2  sprigs fresh rosemary
6  peppercorns; bruised
2 cup dry red wine
1/2 cup vinegar
1/4 cup butter or margarine
1  salt
1  freshly ground pepper
4  fresh tomatoes; chopped -or- tomato sauce
3  allspice berries

After washing the rabbit or hare thoroughly and cutting into serving
pieces, place in a large glass or earthenware bowl.  Make a marinade by
combining the celery, onions, carrots, herbs, peppercorns, wine, and
vinegar and pouring over the meat.  Cover and refrigerate for a day or two,
turning the pieces over occasionally.

On serving day, drain, reserving the marinade, and wipe dry. Transfer the
marinade to a casserole and simmer for 15 minutes. While the marinade is
cooking, heat the butter in a large frying pan, and when very hot sear the
meat over high heat until it is reddened in color without browning. Remove
from the heat, and with a spatula lift the rabbit or hare pieces into the
simmering marinade, then pour in the remaining butter. Taste for seasoning,
then add the salt and pepper, tomatoes, and allspice. Weight the meat with
a small plate to keep it under the sauce, then bake it in a very slow oven
(225 F) for 2-1/2 hours, or until the meat is tender and the sauce
thickened.

Lamb & Cayenne Kefta

meats

1  stephen ceideburg
1 pound lean ground lamb
1 medium onion, finely chopped
2 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1 teaspoon ground allspice
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1  pita bread
1  low-fat yogurt
1  tomatoes
1  lettuce
1  cooked rice (optional)

Keftas, from North Africa, are meatballs prepared with ground lamb or
beef and a number of herbs and spices. They appear in a variety of
dishes, such as stews, and also as brochettes hot off the charcoal
grill. The seasonings range from chili to cinnamon and usually
include a Moroccan favorite, fresh mint. These keftas are delicious
served with pita bread, low-fat yogurt, tomatoes and lettuce or with
cooked rice. Note: If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 20
minutes.

Combine all ingredients, cover and refrigerate for 1 hour or up to 24
hours. Shape into 30 1 1/2-inch meatballs and thread them on six
skewers. (You may slightly flatten them to make sausage shapes or
leave them as balls.)

Prepare a gas grill or charcoal fire. Grill for 3 minutes on each
side, or just until no longer pink inside. Alternatively, broil the
meatballs for 2 minutes on each side.

1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon black pepper
1  water, to cover the meat
1  salt, to tast

Intro. Tagines are Moroccan slow-cooked meat, fruit and vegitable dishes
which are almost invariablely made with mutton. Using lamb cuts down
the cooking time, but if you can find good hogget (older than lamb,
younger than mutton, commonly labelled "baking legs" and sold
cheaply) that will do very well. 1.In a large saucepan gently fry the
onion in the olive oil until soft, add the meat to the pan and cook
until it changes color, then add the spices. Add water to just cover
the meat and salt to taste. Cover and simmer gently until the meat is
tender, about 1 1/2 - 2 hours. (Displace the lid a little after an
hour if there appears to be too much liquid.) 2.Add the pears to the
meat together with the sultanas and almonds. Cook for a further 5
minutes or until the pears are soft. Serve with rice.

1  virgin olive oil

IN A DUTCH OVEN or 3-quart heavy pot, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil

Cook, stirring, 1 minute. Return the meat to the pot. Add the stock

bake 1 1/2 hours, or until the lamb is cooked and the beans are
tender. Meanwhile, using a small paring knife, cut off tip and stem
of the tomatoes. Remove the seeds and core, leaving only firm, outer
pulp. Slice one side of each tomato and lay it flat on work surface.
Cut into 1/4-inch lengthwise strips, pile up strips and cut across
into 1/4-inch pieces. Reserve on a plate until needed. Add the
macaroni to the casserole, replace in oven, and cook, covered,

1 1/2 pound lean lamb (pref.leg), ground
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (or more)
1  salt and freshly ground pepper
1 cup tomato sauce or puree  diluted w/ w; ater & warmed

In a frying pan, heat the 2 tablespoons butter and cook the onion

with cinnamon, salt, pepper, then stir in the tomato sauce and
parsley. Cover the pan and simmer for 20 minutes. (This much can be
cooked a day in advance and stored in the refrigerator.) Meanwhile,
soak the toast slices in the milk to make a soft mixture, and add to
the meat along with the eggs and cheese. Mix the filling with a
wooden spoon, taste, and add more cinnamon if you like.

Butter the bottom and sides of a 9 x 12 x 3 inch baking pan. Spread 6
filo sheets, brushing melted butter in between the sheets, making
sure the pasry fits the sides and bottom of the pan. Pour in the
filling, spreading evenly with a spatula. Cover with the remaining 6
filo sheets, brushing with butter as before. Flute the edges with two
fingers or a fork and brush the top with butter. Using a sharp knife,
score the top 3 filo sheets into square or diamond shapes. Bake for
40 to 50 minutes in a moderately slow oven (325 F), raising the
temperature to 350 F during the last 10 minutes. Remove from the oven
and let stand on a rack for 15 minutes. Cut into diamonds or squares
and serve warm.

Lamb Vindaloo

meats, indian

2 pound lamb, cubed
2 tablespoon coriander seed
1 tablespoon cumin seed
2 pound tomatoes, crushed
14  garlic cloves, crushed
6  bay leaves
1  ginger (fresh), 2 inches, finely ch; opped
1/2 teaspoon black pepper, ground
1/2 teaspoon cardamon seed
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon cloves
1/2 teaspoon cayenne
2 teaspoon mustard seed, ground
1 tablespoon turmeric
1 cup wine vinegar
2 medium onions
2 medium potatoes
2 tablespoon butter

Lightly roast the cumin seed and coriander seed by frying with no oil for a
minute or so, stirring constantly.  Grind these and combine them into a
paste with the other spices, the garlic, ginger and the vinegar. Add the
lamb to the marinade and mix well. Refrigerate for 3-24 hours while mixing
every few hours as convenient.

Finely chop the onions and potatoes and saute them for 5 minutes in the
butter.

Add lamb and spice paste and simmer over low heat for half an hour. The
marinating does add a lot of flavor and makes the meat much more tender.
This can be skipped if need be.

NOTES:

*  A spicy hot Indian lamb dish -- Very loosely based on Dharamjit Singh's
recipe in "Indian Cookery:  A Practical Guide."  Most restaurants that
serve this dish pronounce it vinDAloo, with the stress on the second
syllable.

: Difficulty:  easy (though it's easy to burn the spices while roasting
them).
: Time:  1 hour preparation, 1 day marinating, 1 hour cooking.
: Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

yourself, but in a pinch, store bought ground cumin and coriander
will do."

half rings. Chop fourth onion finely. Keep two types of onions
separately.
Put garlic and ginger into container of blender or food processor;
add 3 Tbsp of the water and process till smooth.

cooking time. Remove onions with slotted spoon; spread on cookie
sheet lined with paper towel.
Add cinnamon, cardamom and cloves to hot oil in pan. Stir 5 seconds
over medium-high heat. Add 10 cubes meat or as many as pan will hold
in single layer. (Do not crowd pan.) Brown meat on one side; turn and
brown meat on other side. Remove with slotted spoon; set aside.
Repeat with remaining meat.
Add chopped onion to oil. Stir and fry on medium heat until brown
around edges.
Add garlic-ginger paste. Stir and fry until all water in it seems
to boil away, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat. Add coriander and cumin;
fry 30 seconds.
Add 1 Tbsp yogurt; stir and fry, incorporating into sauce. Add
another tablespoon yogurt, incorporating it into sauce. Repeat with
remaining yogurt.
Add meat and accumulated juices in bowl, remaining water, cayenne

instead of the lamb. It is excellent anyway it comes.

Lambratis Andros (Easter Lamb Or Kid Andros S

meats, lamb, greek

1  karen mintzias
1  baby lamb or kid, 10-12 kg
1  salt
1  freshly ground black pepper
2  lemons
1/4 cup butter; melted
1/4 cup olive oil
      ----SPINACH and FETA STUFFING----
2 1/2 kg spinach
3 cup chopped spring onions
3/4 cup olive oil
1 cup short grain rice
1 1/2 kg feta cheese
1/4 cup chopped fresh dill
1/4 cup chopped fresh mint
1  salt
1  freshly ground black pepper

Serves: 20 Oven temperature: 180 C (350 F) Cooking time: 4-5 hours

Wipe lamb inside and out with a damp cloth.  Rub cavity and outside
of lamb with lemon juice, salt and pepper. Cover and leave aside
until stuffing is prepared.

Trim roots from spinach and remove discoloured and damaged leaves.
Wash spinach in several changes of water, drain well and chop
coarsely.

In a large deep pan (not aluminium) gently fry spring onions in oil
until soft, add spinach and stir over heat until it wilts. Stir in
washed rice, cover pan and cook on low heat for 10 minutes until most
of liquid is absorbed.  Remove from heat and cool.  Break up feta
into small chunks and add to spinach mixture with herbs. Mix well,
taste, then add salt if necessary and a generous grinding of pepper.
Blend thoroughly.

Partly sew up the cavity with white string, pack stuffing in through
opening and finish sewing up the cavity. Push foreshanks back towards
body and tie in postition, passing string over back of carcase. Tie
back legs, leaving them a little apart - tying will prevent them
splaying outwards. Rub outside again with lemon juice, salt and
pepper and place on a rack set in a large catering-size baking dish.

Combine melted butter with olive oil and brush half of this over the
lamb or kid.  Cover dish with large sheets of foil, sealing joins
with double folds. Press foil under edges of dish to seal completely.

Bake in a moderate oven for 4-5 hours.  After 2 hours lift foil and
brush meat with butter-oil mixture. Cook for further 1 1/2 to 2
hours, remove foil, brush again and cook uncovered for 30 minutes or
until meat is cooked through and browned.  Remove from oven, cover
with foil and a thick cloth and leave to rest for 30 minutes before
carving. Lift lamb or kid onto a large wooden board, remove string
and spoon stuffing onto a platter. Turn the carcase onto its back and
chop along backbone from the inside with a cleaver. Then chop each
half into chunks and pile onto platters. Meat on legs may be carved
into slices.

Larp.

beef, thai

1 pound fresh ground beef.
1  mint leaves.
3  cloves garlic.
1 tablespoon shallot - chopped.
1 teaspoon coriander seeds - ground.
1 teaspoon ground hot chili peppers. *
1 tablespoon ground toasted rice. **
1 tablespoon scallion - chopped.
2 tablespoon lime juice.
1 teaspoon salt.
1 tablespoon fish sauce.
1  fresh raw vegetables.

* Adjust the amount of ground hot chili pepper to taste. Serve extra
on the side to be added to the dish as needed.

** Make toasted rice by browning RAW rice in a hot dry wok or frying
pan, and then ground coarsely in a blender, OR an acceptable
substitute is to brown a commercial "cream of rice" in a hot dry
pan/wok.

Wrap the shallot and garlic in aluminum foil and roast on the stove
for approx. 2 minutes per side till the content is scorched. Remove
the content from the foil, mash together well (with mortar and pestle,
if available) and set aside.

Lightly cook the ground beef in a dry pan/wok until the pink is just
gone, and place in a bowl.  Let cool for a few minutes. Add fish
sauce, salt, lime juice, and mix well. Add the mashed garlic/shallot,
ground coriander seed, toasted rice, ground hot chili, chopped
scallion, and lightly toss together with a fork. Serve on a bed of
lettuce leaves and garnish with mint leaves.

This dish should be served with fresh raw assorted vegetables such as:
chunks of "yard-long bean", nappa leaves (select the more tender inner
leaves), lettuce leaves (Romaine and other leave lettuces are
excellent), celery, and so on.

Leek & Meat Patties

beef, jewish, passover

2 large bunches fresh leeks; (about
1  8 medium size)
1 pound lean ground beef
2 large eggs; beaten
1/4 cup matzo meal or
1  matzo cake meal
1 teaspoon ; salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
      ----FOR FRYING----
1/2 cup matzo cake meal; for coating
1  vegetable oil
3  to 4 large eggs; beaten

To clean the leeks, cut off and discard the roots and all but 1 to 2
inches of the green tops.  Slice the leeks in half lengthwise and
rinse them very well under cool running water to remove any grit.
Coarsely chop the leeks and put them in a saucepan with water to
cover. Simmer them, covered, for 20 to 30 minutes, or until they are
very tender.

Drain the leeks well; then cool them until they can be handled. Use
your hands to squeeze out all the excess liquid. Grind the leeks in a
meat grinder (or very coarsely puree them with a food processor).

In a medium-size bowl, combine the leeks with the ground beef, eggs,
1/4 cup matzo meal, salt, and pepper. Use your hands or a fork to
blend them well. The mixture should be soft, but firm enough to be
molded into patties.  Add more matzo meal, if necessary.

Form the leek-meat mixture into small patties about 2 inches wide and
1/2-inch thick, coating each with cake meal to make it easier to
shape. In a large skillet, over medium heat, heat oil that is about
1/4-inch deep until it is hot but not smoking.  Dip each patty into
the beaten egg to coat it and drain off the excess; then immediately
set it in the hot oil. Fry the patties until they are golden brown on
both sides.
Makes about thirty 2-inch patties.  Source:  The Jewish Holiday

1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves =or=- dr; ied thyme
1/2 tablespoon salt; or as desired
1  white pepper
2 cup cooked rice
1/2 cup whipping cream

from the oven and place the lamb on a cutting board. Let rest 15
minutes before carving. Scrape the onions into a food processor, add
the rice, cream, nutmeg and desired salt, and pulse, scraping down

Lemon Mint Lamb Chops

meats

8  loin lamb chops
3 tablespoon lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint (or 1/2 teaspoon; d)
1  lemon mint butter:
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperatur; e
2 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint (or 1/2 teaspoon; ed)
1  salt and freshly ground pepper to t; aste

Trim excess fat off the lamb chops.  Combine the lemon juice, salt,
olive oil, mint and pepper.  Marinate the lamb in this mixture in a
flat dish, turning often, for at least 30 minutes at room temperature
or longer in the refrigerator.

While lamb is marinating, prepare the compound butter. Cream the
butter with the lemon juice, mint and salt and pepper to taste. Place
the butter on a piece of waxed paper and shape into a cylinder about
3 x 1 1/2 inches. Refrigerate.

Broil, barbecue or pan fry the lamb chops approximately 3 to 5
minutes on each side (they should be slightly rare). Slice the butter
thinly and place two slices on each hot chop.  The butter will melt
slowly and moisten and flavour the lamb.  Lower-fat Version: Use only
a very thin slice of the lemon butter, or omit it entirely. Yield: 4

Leveropostej (Liver Paste)

appetizers, meats

2 tablespoon butter
3 tablespoon flour
1 cup heavy cream
1 cup milk
1 pound pork liver; fresh
3/4 pound pork fat; fresh
1 medium onion; coarsely chopped
3  flat anchovy fillets; draind
2  eggs
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon white pepper
1/2 teaspoon allspice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
3/4 pound pork fat; fresh, sliced into long,

Melt the butter in a saucepan, remove from the heat, and stir in the
flour. Add the milk and cream and bring to a boil over high heat,
beating constantly with a whisk until the sauce is smooth and thick.
Let it simmer for a minute then set aside to cool. Cut the liver into
chunks. Roughly chop the pork fat and mix both with the chopped onion
and anchovies. Divide the mixture into thirds. Pur‚e each batch in an
electric blender set at high speed, adding enough sauce to keep the
mixture from clogging the blender. Transfer each completed batch to a
large bowl and beat in any remaining cream sauce. (To make by hand,
first have the butcher grind the liver and pork fat together, 3
times, very fine, then combine with the cream sauce, beating them
together thoroughly.) Beat the eggs well with the salt, pepper,
allspice and cloves and mix thoroughly into the liver mixture. The
blender mixture will be considerably more fluid that the one made by
hand. Preheat the oven to 350øF. Line a 1-quart loaf pan or mold with
the strips of pork fat. Arrange the strips lengthwise or crosswise,
making sure they overlap slightly and cover the bottom and sides of
the pan. If long enough, let them hang over the sides; otherwise,
save enough strips to cover the top. Spoon the liver mixture into the
loaf pan and fold the overhanging strips (or extra strips) of pork
fat over the top. Cover with a double thickness of aluminum foil,
sealing the edges tightly, and place in a large baking pan. Pour into
the baking pan enough boiling water to reach at least halfway up the
side of the load pan and bake the liver paste in the center of the
oven for 1 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven and lift off the foil.
When it cools to room temperature, re-cover with foil and chill
thoroughly. Liver paste may be served in 1/2" thick slices as a first
course, luncheon dish, or on bread as smorrebrod.

Lihapiirakka

meats, finnish

      ----DOUGH----
3 ounce butter
1 cup milk
1/3 cup sugar
3 cup wheat flour
1 ounce yeast cake (or 1 package of dried y; east)
      ----FILLING----
1 large yellow onion
1 pound meat, ground (mixed beef and pork)
1 cup cream
1 1/4 cup rice, cooked (left-over rice is fin; e)
1  egg
1  salt and pepper

MAKE THE DOUGH:  melt the butter and add milk.  Heat the mixture to 100
degrees F.  Crumble the yeast into a bowl.  Add the butter-and-milk mixture
and whip it until the yeast as dissolved. Add sugar, salt and flour and
stir until it becomes a dough. Cover the bowl and let rise in a warm place
for about 40 minutes.

While the dough rises, chop the onion into very small pieces and put in a
large frying pan.  Add the ground meat immediately and saute for 10
minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the cooked rice and saute this mixture
another 5 minutes. Add the cream, season to taste with salt and pepper, and
turn off the heat. Let the frying pan stand on the stove, covered, until
the dough is ready. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Roll out the dough so it fits in a 12x16 inch baking dish.  Put the dough
into the dish so that the dough covers the whole dish (this is the most
difficult part; don't be discouraged if you have to roll out the dough
again).

Add the filling on top of the dough.  Whip the egg and spread it over the
filling.  Bake it on the bottom rack in the oven for about 20 minutes.

When the pie has cooled off a bit; cut it into pieces that are about 1 1/4
inches by 6 inches (the traditional size of lihapiirakka in Finland).
Serve.

NOTES:

*  Finnish meat pie -- This is an excellent-tasting stomach filler. My dear
mother gave me this recipe when I moved away from home. She probably
thought that it would give me that feeling of home. It does. I have tried
it on my friends and it is always a hit. My mother is from Finland. Yield:
Serves 4-6.

*  While eating lihapiirakka, you can try the hard work of pronouncing its
name.  Liha means meat and piirakka is just piirakka. The filling can of
course be varied.  Other traditional Finnish fillings for other piirakkas
are blueberries (with some potato flour on top) and cottage cheese.

: Difficulty:  moderate.
: Time:  30 minutes preparation, 30 minutes cooking and cooling.
: Precision:  measure the crust ingredients carefully.

Loukanika

meats, greek

1 pound lean pork shoulder, ground
1/2 pound fresh pork rind - boiled for 2 hour; s, - drained, and ground
1/2 pound pork fatback, ground
1 teaspoon salt
1  navel orange - grated rind only
1 teaspoon crushed dried marjoram or- thyme
1  bay leaf; ground in a mortar
1/3 cup dry red wine
1 teaspoon ground allspice or coriander or- bo; th
1  freshly ground black pepper
2  garlic cloves; crushed
1  sausage casing

Grind the pork, pork rind, and fatback through the fine blade of a
meat chopper.  Combine in a large bowl with all the seasonings. Knead
thoroughly.  Store in the refrigerator while you prepare the casing.

Ususally salted, the casing (pork intestine) especially the interior,
must be rinsed under cold running water several times. (To avoid
losing casing down the drain while doing this, be sure the casing is
inside a very large pan!)  Allow to drain on a linen towel.

Use a pastry bag to force the stuffing into the casing. Pinch at
3-1/2 to 4 inch intervals allowing space between to form the sausage
links. Normally the casing will not break, but if it does, that
section must be discarded and a knot tied in the new "end". To cook,
poach in water for 1 hour, then drain, discarding the cooking water.
Fry the sausages in a frying pan over moderate heat, or use as
suggested in any recipe. Drain and serve hot.

Note: To store, freeze uncooked in meal-sized batches. The sausages
should be used within a day or two if not frozen.

Madras Lamb (Indian)

lamb, indian

1/4 cup oil
3 large garlic coves, chopped
1  1-2 tb cayenne
1 teaspoon ground cumin seed
1/4 teaspoon powdered ginger
1/4 cup tomato paste, mixed with 3 tbs wate; r
1/4 teaspoon whole cardamom seeds, de-podded
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 large onion, chopped finely

the heat and continue cooking, stirring often, until the onion turns
golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Add the garlic, garam masala and
cayenne, lower the heat to medium-high, and saute for another 2
minutes. Stir in the ground spices and saute another 2 minutes,
stirring. Add the meat, stir well, and brown it in the spices for
about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste mixture and cardamom seeds and
stir well. Lower heat, cover pan tightly, and simmer about 30
minutes, stirring occasionally and adding more water by teaspoon if sauce
starts to stick to the pan. Uncover the pan and stir in the lemon
juice and salt. Simmer uncovered about 10 minutes longer, stirring
frequently, until the meat is tender and the sauce is very thick.

Mageritsa (Easter Lamb Soup)

lamb, greek

1  karen mintzias
1  intestines, heart, lungs,
1  and liver of 1 lamb.
1  1 lamb's feet and tripe, opt
1  lamb's head (optional)
1  salt
2  lemons (juice only)
1 small bunch scallions; chopped
2/3 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup chopped fresh dill
1/4 cup chopped celery leaves
6 tablespoon raw long-grain white rice
1/2 teaspoon aniseed (optional)
1  freshly ground pepper
3  whole eggs

Note: If using the lamb's head, wash it, then soak it in cold water
for 3 hours. Drain. Cut the head in half, using a sharp knife, and
tie with a clean string.

If using the lamb's feet and tripe, prepare as follows: If tripe is
not parially cooked, cut open with a sharp knife and clean the inside
thoroughly under running water. Put in a pan with cold salted water to
cover and soak for 30 minutes, then drain and wash with cold water.
Cut into small pieces and put in a large soup pot with the lamb's
feet. cover with cold water, and simmer until tender, adding salt to
taste during the last minutes of cooking. Cube the tripe, remove the
meat of the feet from the bones, and add to the mageritsa at the same
time as the cut-up intestines, adjusting the liquid by adding more
water.

Clean the intestines thoroughly by turning them inside out, using a
long skewer or stick (this turning will be quicker if the intestines
are first cut into 2-foot lengths), then wash under cold running
water until clean. Rub the intestines with salt and the juice of 1/2
lemon, rinse again in cold water and drain. Braid the intestines or
tie the ends together with clean string. Put in a large soup pot with
the lamb's head, if using, and cove with cold water. Bring to a boil,
then lower the heat, skim, and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove the
intestines, drain them, and cut into 1/4 inch pieces with the
scissors and set aside to add to the soup later. (Use the remaining
portion of the head for another dish.)

Bring the soup stock to a boil and add the scallions, parsley, dill,
and celery leaves. Cut the heart, lungs, and liver into small
bite-sized cubes, and add them to the soup, and simmer for 15
minutes. Add the rice, cut-up intestines, aniseed, salt and pepper to
taste and continue simmering until the rice is tender, approximately
15 minutes, adding more water as needed and the brains during the
last few minutes of cooking.

Half an hour before serving, bring the soup to a boil, then remove
from the heat and prepare the avgolemono: Beat the eggs for 2
minutes. Continue to beat, gradually add the remaining lemon juice.
Then 1 to 2 cups of the hot soup by droplets, beating steadily, until
all has been added. Add the avgolemono to the soup. Stir over minimum
heat until thickened. Serve warm but avoid boiling the soup after
adding the avgolemono.

A richer Mageritsa can be made by sauteing the scallions in 3
tablespoons butter or oil before adding to the soup.

Maize Burgers

meats

1  stephen ceideburg
1 pound lean ground beef
2/3 cup yellow cornmeal
1 tablespoon lime juice
1  egg white
1 teaspoon ground cumin, or to taste
2 teaspoon chili powder
1  salt and pepper to taste
1  fresh jalapeno pepper *
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 cup corn kernels **
1 cup salsa
6  10-inch flour tortillas
1  shredded iceberg lettuce, optional
1  lime wedges for garnish

* seeded and finely chopped, or to taste (see note) ** frozen, or
canned and drained

The crunch of corn with your favorite salsa makes a delicious,
lower-fat Southwestern hamburger served on a flour tortilla with
shredded lettuce and lime wedges.

In a mixing bowl, mix lightly the ground beef, cornmeal, lime juice,
egg white, cumin, chili powder, salt, pepper and jalapeno. Shape into
6 large thin patties and reserve on a sheet of wax paper.

Over medium-high heat, heat a 12-inch skillet, then add the oil to
coat the bottom. Place patties in the hot skillet and cook 3 to 5
minutes per side, turning once, until the meat is cooked through and
the patties are a deep golden brown.

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine corn and salsa and heat. In
the microwave, heat flour tortillas wrapped in a cloth or on paper
plates for 15 seconds on high.

To serve, place a cooked patty on a flour tortilla, top with a
serving of salsa and fold. Add shredded lettuce if desired. Serve a
wedge of lime alongside.

Note: When preparing fresh chilies, wear rubber gloves for protection
against oils that later can cause burning sensation on skin.

Margo's Lamb Stew

meats, soups

3 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion (thinly sliced)
4  garlic cloves, minced
3 pound lamb cut into stew-sized cubes and; carefully trimmed of fat
4 pound tomatoes, cooked (2 large cans)
3  bay leaves
1  lemon juice
1 tablespoon hungarian paprika
1 teaspoon celery salt
1/2 teaspoon cumin, ground
1/8 teaspoon cayenne
1 dash allspice
1 dash cinnamon, ground
1 1/2 pound green beans, fresh, washed and trim; med

In a steeped, saute onion in olive oil on medium-low heat until golden
brown. Add garlic in the last 2-3 minutes. Add lamb cubes and saute until
brown. Add tomatoes and simmer until meat is tender. Keep an eye on the
liquid; add water or red wine if it becomes dry.

Add bay leaves, lemon juice and spices.  Simmer on low heat for at least 2
hours.  About 1/2 hour before pronouncing it done, add the green beans.
Serve with plain yogurt and pita bread.

NOTES:

*  Fragrant lamb stew -- This recipe comes from Margo Kaiser, with whom I
used to work. It's a delicious stew, spiced fragrantly but not hot. It's
one of my favorites. It's also very easy. The most tedious work is trimming
the lamb, and you can get the butcher to take care of that.

The spice mixture is my attempt to re-create Margo's "secret spice" (she
didn't offer that recipe).  Feel free to try your own variations. If you
hit on one that you feel is particularly good, please let me know about it.
Yield:  serves 6 to 8.

*  I prefer to cook to the point of simmering, refrigerate overnight, and
then finish cooking the next evening. This greatly enhances the flavor.
When you take the stew from the refrigerator, skim any lamb fat that has
congealed on the top before continuing.

*  I find that many butchers don't understand that I want good quality meat
in stews. I get better quality, more carefully trimmed meat by telling them
that I want lamb cubes cut for shish kebab.

: Difficulty:  easy.
: Time:  20 minutes preparation, several hours cooking.
: Precision:  measure the spices.

Marinated Beef Province Style

main dish, meats, beef

1/4 pound bacon
2 pound round steak
2  cloves garlic
2 tablespoon chopped parsley
1 pinch ground cloves
1 pinch allspice
3 tablespoon red wine vinegar
2 1/2 cup red wine
6  medium onions
6  medium carrots
1  salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoon oil
2 tablespoon brandy
1 pinch thyme
1  sprigs parsley
1 pinch rosemary
1  small orange

Cut meat into 2 inch cubes.  Dice the bacon.  Skin and crush the
garlic, using the tip of a firm knife, in a pinch of salt on the
chopping board, or use a garlic press; blend with the chopped
parsley, cloves, and allspice. Put  the meat into a dish,  and add
the wine vinegar, wine, and garlic spice  mixture.
Peel  and  thinly slice one third of  the  onions and carrots, add
to the marinade with a little salt and pepper. Leave for at least 12
hours turning occasionally. Peel the remaining onions and carrots,
quarter the onions but leave the carrots  whole.
Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet,  fry the diced bacon and
quartered onions  until golden brown, and spoon into a casserole.
Remove the meat from the marinade,  drain well.
Brown meat in the oil remaining  in the pan and add to the onions.
Pour the marinade  liquid and vegetables into the skillet and stir
well to absorb the last of the oil. Add the whole carrots, brandy,
and herbs. Cut the zest from the orange and squeeze a little orange
juice and add this and the zest to the sauce. Season the sauce with a
little salt and pepper. Pour over the meat and onions, cover the
casserole. Cook in the center of a slow (350 d F) for 2 1/4 hours. To
serve, remove the garni.
This dish is particularly good  when  served  with spaghetti,
macaroni, or noodles, topped with butter, grated cheese and a little
chopped parsley.

on low setting 8 hours, or until noodles are tender. Top with cheese,
cover and cook until cheese melts. "This is the kind of recipe that
can be varied as long as the soup is included and enough other liquid
is added. It can be jazzed up with other veggies, and red and green
pepper add color. For a Tex-Mex version, add canned chopped chiles
and chopped black olives, chili powder and cumin. Although the cheese
can be left off, it tastes better with it."

Meat Loaf Bourguignon

beverages, meats

2 1/2 pound lean ground beef
1/2 pound ground pork or
1/2 pound sausage meat
2 large onions; chopped
3 centiliter garlic; minced
1/2 cup fresh parsley; minced
2 teaspoon dried oregano
2 teaspoon dried thyme
2 teaspoon nutmeg
2 teaspoon salt; optional
1 teaspoon pepper
3 tablespoon teriyaki sauce or
1 tablespoon soy sauce; low sodium preferred
2 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 cup dry red wine
2 cup unsalted crackers; crushed
1/2 cup walnuts; finely minced
2  eggs; slightly beaten
1/2 pound Cheddar cheese; cut into 1/8-inch slices
1  parsley sprigs

Into a large bowl place all the ingredients except the cheese and
parsley sprigs in the order given.  Knead the mixture well to mix
thoroughly,. Divide the mixture in half and form each half into a
compact loaf approximately 1 1/2 inches in depth.  Place the cheese
on the top of one of the loaves and top with the other loaf. Pinch
the loaves together well, to seal.  Place in a shallow roasting pan
and bake in a preheated 400 degree oven 1 hour.  Remove from the
oven. Slice the loaf and arrange slices on a a warm platter. Garnish
with parsley sprigs.

Judi's Notes:  I think a 400 degree oven is too high for meat loaf
and so always bake my meat loaves at 350-375 degrees and just cook it
a few minutes longer. I also like to remove some of the fat and
juices that accumulate in the pan about half way through cooking by
using a turkey baster to suction in out of the pan.

Meatballs (Same Day)

beef, italian

1 pound ground chuck
3 each while, smilin' eggs
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese; grated
1 single salt and pepper to taste
1 pound ground pork
1 1/2 cup bread crumbs*
4 each to 6 garlic cloves*
1 single fresh basil leaves***

* Or enough to hold the mixture together. Try to use leftover French
or Italian bread, and whole wheat crumbs work well also. ** Chopped
very fine *** If you have them on hand (GrandMa Rose always adds
fresh basil) YIELD: 15-18 medium meatballs, or 40-45 tiny meatballs.
Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl. Toss gently with your
hands until the meat has become thoroughly blended with all the
seasonings.
The mixture should be farily moist. 2.  To form the meatballs, wet
your hands in a small bowl of lukewarm water and then pick up about
1/3 cup of the meatball mixture. Roll it in the palm of your hands to
form a smooth ball about 1 inch in diameter. 3.  Drop the meatballs
directly into your basic tomato sauce recipe. Or, if you prefer a
crusty meatball, fry in approximately 3 tablespoons of olive oil on
medium heat for about 5 min, turning to brown evenly.  Then drop them
into gently boiling tomato sauce as they are browned. Meatballs take
about 20 min to cook well. (Remember to scrape the bottom of skillet
and pour meat particles into sauce.)

Mike's Beef Jerky

appetizers, beef

2 pound london broil
1/2 cup soy sauce
2 tablespoon worstershire sauce
2 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoon onion powder
2 teaspoon fresly ground black pepper
2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, less for sissies
2 tablespoon liquid smoke

Freeze the London Broil or other lean roast.  When ready to make
jerky, remove the roast from the freezer and let partially thaw. When
just able to slice, first remove all fat and then slice against the
grain in thin (1/4 inch or less) slices. Cover the meat with the
marinade, turn from time to time and let marinade overnight.  In the
morning line a shallow cookie sheet with a few layers of paper
towels.  Place on lower rack. Place upper rack in oven in top
position and lower rack in lower position. Hang the beef slices from
the upper rack with tooth picks above the paper towels. I find about
6 hours at 160F average temp is about right.

If your oven is real tight, you might crack open the door a bit to
allow the water vapor to escape.

Mike's Salse Di Carne

main dish, beef, italian

2 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium onion, finely chopped
2 medium carrots, finely chopped
2 each celery stalks, finely choped
3 each cloves garlic, pressed
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 pound lean ground beef
2 tablespoon all purpose flour
1 can campbell's beef broth 10 1/2 ounce; s equal amount water
1  freshly ground black pepper and sal; t to taste

I first process the carrots in the food processor to get them really
chopped finely.  Then process the onion and celery to a course fine
chop. Heat the oil in a large sauce pan and saute the onion, carrots,
celery, garlic and parsley. When they start to soften, add the ground
beef and fry until the meat browns.  Then stir in the soup, water,
salt and pepper. Simmer uncovered gently for an hour or so.  Watch
the liquid content of the sauce.  The sauce should thicken but still
retain a little of the moisture. When ready to serve, thicken the
sauce with the 2 plus or minus tablespoons of flour to make it thick
and sticky. Can be served over any spaghetti or linguini, but best
IMHO served over or on the side with Mike's Capellini with Garlic.

onion and garlic. The fresh mint is essential for an exciting burst
of flavor in these luscious patties. Chop the leaves coarsely with a

slices. Drain the yogurt through a strainer lined with cheesecloth
for one hour before serving.

1. Prepare hot coals for grilling.

2. Place the ground lamb in a bowl and mix well with onion, garlic and
chopped mint, being sure not to overmix. Season to taste with salt and
pepper. Gently form the mixture into 4 patties.

3. Grill the burgers over hot coals, 3" from heat, for about 4
minutes per side for rare meat or 5 minutes per side for medium-rare.

4. Serve the lamb burgers immediately on buns topped with a tomato
slice and a dollop of yogurt, if desired.

To prepare the eggplant, salt both sides of each piece and place in a
colander in a single layer for about 1 hour to drain.  Rinse, pat
dry, and set aside

Brown the meat in a medium size skillet over medium heat.  Drain off
the fat and liquid and remove the meat to a bowl or plate.  Using the
same skillet, cook the onion and garlic, stirring, over medium heat
until softened.  To make the sauce, add the rest of the ingredients,
except the feta cheeseand dill, and simmer until hot and slightly
thickened, 15-20 minutes.

Layer in the slow cooker in this order:  sauce, eggplant, meat, sauce,
eggplant, meat, sauce.  Sprinkle the feta cheese on top and the dill
on top of that.  Cover, set on low, and cook for 7-9 hours, or set on
high and cook for 2-3 hours.

1 tablespoon mustard seed

1 single sauce
1 quart water
1 cup catsup
1 tablespoon flour
4 tablespoon cornstartch
1 tablespoon vinegar
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 single pepper; taste
1 single water

This is the recipe I promised to send.  It is a bit of a task to
prepare, but well worth the effort.  The recipe was passed down for
many generations in my husbands family who immigrated here from
Russia (being Russian Jews) so, I have no idea why they called it
'German' meatballs, but a meatball by any other name...I guess! >>>>
Slice the garlic into a water glass and pour 2 tablespoon boiling water
over
it.  Mash the garlic well, then add 2 tablespoon. more boiling water.
Strain
through a kitchen towel, saving the liquid only. Mix together all the
ingredients, including garlic liquid then shape into balls about the
size of a large egg. Roll the balls in the flour until well coated.
Melt enough fat to make about 1/2" in a heavy skillet or cast iron
cooking pot.  Brown the meat balls in the fat. Remove the meatballs
and pour off all but 4 tablespoon. of the fat. Sauce and balance of cooking
instructions follow next page: Ingredients: SAUCE:  Add 1 qt. water
to the reserved fat along with the catsup. Make a paste of the next
six ingredients, then mix in enough water to get a consistency of a
thin cream. After the water-catsup mixture is warm, slowly add this
mixture, stirring constantly to avoid lumping, until the mixture has
been well absorbed into the liquid. Cook gently until the sauce is
slightly thickened. Place meatball in the pan, or in an oven-proof
roaster and make sure they are covered with the sauce.  Cover pan and
bake in hot oven for 1 hour. Serve with mashed potatoes. (My friends
also love it with pasta or rice!) Enjoy! Barbara Manhattan Beach, Ca

Moroccan Spice-Rubbed Leg Of Lamb

main dish, meats

1  zest from 2 lemons-julienned
1/2 cup fresh lemon juice
1/4 cup honey
2 teaspoon coriander seeds - cracked
1 teaspoon ground cardamom
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon sweet paprika
1 teaspoon tumeric
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
7 1/2 pound boneless leg of lamb, rolled --and; tied
1  whole unpeeled head garlic, --halve; d horizontally
1  kosher salt and fresh pepper
2 tablespoon olive oil

(Note: leftovers are great in pita bread with yogurt-cucumber sauce!)

Preheat oven to 375 F.  In small saucepan of boiling water, blanch the
lemon zest until softened and pale, about 10 minutes. Drain and
transfer to a small bowl. Stir in the lemon juice and honey.

In a small skillet, combine coriander, cardamom, cumin, cinnamon,
paprika, tumeric and cayenne.  Toast the spices over high heat,
stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute.

Light grill or heat a grill pan.   Rub the lan\mb all over with the
cut sides of the garlic.  Coat well with the toasted spices. Season
with salt and pepper and brush with the oil. Grill the lamb over
moderate heat until well-browned all over, about 5 minutes per side.

Transfer the leg of lamb to a roasting pan and roast in the oven for
1 1/4 hours.  Brush the lamb liberally with the honey-lemon sauce and
roast for about 15 minutes longer, or until an instant-read
thermometer reads 140 F for medium-rare meat.

Transfer the lamb to a cutting board, cover loosely with foil and let
rest for 15 minutes before carving. Pour the pan juices into a
sauceboat and serve alongside the lamb.

Moslem-Style Pot Stickers

beef, chinese, lamb

1 pkg gyoza skins, 3 (cut to fit)
      ----FILLING----
1/4 pound napa cabbage
1/2 teaspoon salt, kosher
1/2 pound ground chuck; and
1/2 pound ground top round; or
1 pound lamb, ground
1 tablespoon ginger, fresh; minced*
3 tablespoon scallion; minced
2 tablespoon soy sauce, thin
3 tablespoon shao xing
1 tablespoon sesame oil**
1/2 teaspoon salt, kosher
1/8 teaspoon pepper, black
3/4 teaspoon orange peel, fresh; grated
1/2 cup oil; for frying
2 cup chicken stock; plus
2 tablespoon oil; for steam cooking
      ----DIPPING SAUCE----
1 tablespoon soy sauce, thin
2 tablespoon vinegar, black or balsamic
1/4 teaspoon ginger, fresh; minced
1/4 teaspoon sesame oil*

Filling: Chop the cabbage finely, sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon kosher
salt, and toss well to combine. Let stand a little, then drain the
liquid and wring it out in cheesecloth to get rid of excess water.

Scatter the cabbage in a large bowl, add the beef or lamb, and
sprinkle the rest of the filling ingredients (through the orange
peel) on top. Stir briskly in one direction only until all is well
blended, with chopsticks or a fork, then throw the mixture lightly
against the inside of the bowl a few times to compact the mass. For
the best flavor, cover airtight with plastic wrap pressed directly on
the surface and let stand half an hour at room temperature.

Filling the dumplings: Line a baking sheet with no-stick parchment
paper to hold the finished dumplings (they don't call 'em
pot-stickers for nothing). Fill one wrapper at a time, keeping the
remainder covered. Put two level teaspoons of filling off-center in
the wrapper (as though you were making enchiladas, and nudge (or
nudzh) it with your fingers into a half-moon shape about 2" long.
This makes the dumplings easier to seal. Fold the wrapper exactly in
half over the filling, pinching shut at the midpoint. Beginning to
the right of the midpoint, make three tiny pleats on the *near* side
of the wrapper only, folding the pleats *toward* the midpoint. After
each pleat, pinch the dough to join the far, unpleated side of the
wrapper. Pinch the extreme right corner of the arc closed. Now half
the dumpling is sealed.

Repeat the process to the left of the midpoint, aiming the pleats
toward the midpoint again. Pinch the left corner closed, then gently
pinch all along the arc to insure it is sealed and to thin the ridge
of dough. Pan-frying the dumplings: About 20 minutes before serving,
mix the ingredients for the dipping sauce, taste and adjust to your
liking, and place it in small individual dip dishes or saucers
alongside each place setting. Have two serving platters in a low oven
to warm.

Heat the skillet over high heat until hot enough to evaporate a bead
of water on contact. Add enough oil to coat the bottom with a scant
1/2" of oil, swirl the skillet to glaze it an inch up the sides, then
adjust to give an even layer of oil. Reduce the heat to medium. When
the oil is hot enough to foam a pinch of dry flour, pick up the
dumplings by their tops and quickly arrange them smooth side down in
the pan, making concen- tric rings. Crowd the dumplings a bit; this
makes for prettier presen- tation when you're through. Adjust the
heat so they sizzle mildly.

Once the dumplings are in place, raise the heat slightly to bring
them to a good sizzle and brown the bottoms. Check underneath
frequently, and when the bottoms are evenly browned, give the stock
mixture a stir and add enough to come halfway up the side of the
dumplings. Expect a great hiss and cloud of steam when you add the
stock.

Adjust the heat to maintain a simmer, and cover the pot. After about
seven minutes, lift the lid to peek inside the pot, and when the
stock is almost all absorbed by the dumplings, remove the lid. Lift
one dumpling with a spatula to check the bottom.  If it is not crisp
enough to "clink" against a fingernail, then continue to cook for a
minute or so more. If there is not enough oil left after steaming to
crisp them, add a bit more oil from the side of the pan and swirl to
distribute it under the dumplings.

When the bottoms are crisp, turn off the heat, move the pan off the
burner and loosen the bottoms of the dumplings with the spatula.
Invert them onto the serving platter, bottoms up. Serve with the
individual dishes of dipping sauce.

Okie Stuffed Burgers

main dish, meats, sandwich

2 pound ground round
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon cilantro, dried
2 tablespoon steak sauce
1  cheese slices
6 each hamburger buns
1  === filling ===
4 slice hickory smoked bacon
1/4 cup celery, sliced thin
1/4 cup onion, chopped fine
4 ounce mushroom pieces

Find a large bowl of some sort and combine every one of the
ingredients into it and mix'em together real well.

Next, shape the mixture into 12 equal size patties (they should be
about 4-inches patties).

Now, place 6 of the patties on waxed paper and top each of'em with
equal portions of the filling.

Next, place the remaining patties on top of the other patties and
press the edges to seal in the filling.

MUSHROOM-BACON FILLING:

Get out a small skillet and fry the bacon until they're crisp. Remove
the bacon and set it somewhere to cool so you can crumble'em up.

Drain off a couple of tablespoons of the bacon grease and add the
celery and onion and cook'em 'til they're tender.

Stir in the mushrooms and throw in the crumbled bacon and then divide
it into six equal amounts.

This makes about 1 1/2 cups of filling for what it's worth.

WHEN READY TO GRILL'EM

Place the patties on the grill ohhhh let's say about 3-4 inches from
hot coals.

Cook'em 'til they're browned nicely on both sides or until they're
done to your liking. If I cooked Betty's the way I cooked mine, she
throw rocks at me.

If you're gonna top these dudes with cheese, don't forget to lay some
slices on top of the meat a couple of minutes before you remove the
burgers from the grill. Another thing, toasted burger buns are good,
too.

I know these directions look long, but really, this doesn't take all
that long to throw together. BTW, it takes one whole page to print
this out.
